THE ARREST:&#xD;
OR,&#xD;
THE DARING OF A PATRIOT LOVEII.&#xD;
WHEM the English General Howe found himself master of&#xD;
Bosto , he began to revolve in his mind how he should best punish&#xD;
certai i listinguished families, who ,had been mostactive inoppo-&#xD;
sition to the royal authority. His chief source of information was&#xD;
a young tory, who, by means of his wealth and birth, had gained&#xD;
the confidence of the British chief, and was now an inmate of&#xD;
his military household, The name of this traitorous person was&#xD;
Jenkins Wosley, who had no other recommendations theni id efli&#xD;
person, his money and his high family ; for one of hiauncles had&#xD;
been lieutenant governor of the Coimmonwealth.&#xD;
The general was pacing up and down his library.ixt deep 'refleo-&#xD;
tion, his lips compressed and his brows bent. The young tory was&#xD;
standing in a recess of the 'window, seemingly engaged in watch-&#xD;
ing the measured movements of the sentry in front, but in reality&#xD;
furtivelyscanning the face of the English general. Suddenly the&#xD;
ofcerturaed and said, with some excitement :&#xD;
" Are you prepared to prove this, Mr. Wosley r"&#xD;
" Heie are letters, sir. It is well known that she has been&#xD;
more active than her father, if that were possible, in inspiring the&#xD;
colony with-the 6positioi to the crown. It was she, sir, who&#xD;
copied, and it is rumored, half.dietated the resolutips wheih&#xD;
ipasse&amp;amp;in may lst'at Fantteil Hall. v If 'she remains'in the ety,&#xD;
general; she, will plot   o fourimiechief."&#xD;
"She must be secured ! You think this plea of illness is but&#xD;
an excuse to be suffered.to remain to act as a spy upon us ?"&#xD;
' Without' doubt, sir, I bave no question but that she is in secret&#xD;
correspondence wth Samnel Adams, John Adans, Handdck 'and&#xD;
other rebel clilefs;,ol' whom her uncle is not the least."&#xD;
" To be of his blood is enough to lead me to fear 'hei and to see&#xD;
that she is not 4used toydo us injury.  Here is her, artfilMetier&#xD;
to me.".&#xD;
And General;Howe;took from a file before him on the table, a&#xD;
paperwhich lie read aloud, as follows :&#xD;
"aik Ad ydii do' not-watr upon women, I trust you will per-&#xD;
mit me to remain in the city with an aged-relative, who  dec-ipit&#xD;
and long ainvalid, whom it would be fatal to.attempt, to  move&#xD;
froi her house. 'As, therefore, she cannot ivai  l erself of your&#xD;
permission to leave with others, and as, I cannot, in 'dty;desert&#xD;

I I have placed the proofs of her capability to do you mischief&#xD;
in your excellency's hands," responded the young man, biting his&#xD;
lips and looking vexed, as if fearing that the object at which he&#xD;
aimed might be defeated, after all his efforts to effect it. -1&#xD;
"Yes; the proofs are clear enough. She has done enough for&#xD;
- her rebellious uncle, and for Hancock and Adams;, to, forfeit, her&#xD;
head as well as they," he responded, with angry decision. "Bk&#xD;
having her in my power I may not only obtain papers of impor-N&#xD;
tance iui her hands, but have a hold upon her disloyal uncle, and&#xD;
bring him to terms.  The arrest shall be made !"&#xD;

Thus resolving, the British general seated himself at his table,&#xD;
and wrote hastily a few lines, which he read over to himself, and&#xD;
then placed in the hands of an orderly,-whom he called from. the&#xD;
hall.. The man, receiving the note, touched the front of his cap,&#xD;
and departed to place it in the hands of the officer to-whom it was&#xD;
addressed. As the door closed upon him, the face of Jenkins&#xD;
Wolsey, the rich tory colonist, lighted up with malicious signifi-&#xD;
catibn.&#xD;
"aYou seem 'to be pleased, Wolsey !" said the general, who&#xD;
could not but remark the expressionof elation on his face.&#xD;
Yes, your excellency ; I am always pleased to: see the ene"-&#xD;
mies of thecrown secured from doing mischief."-:&#xD;
&#xD;
Where shall.I imprison her ?" asked the general, as if per-&#xD;
plexed to know what he should do with his fair prisoner after ar-&#xD;
resting her.  This inquiry was not addressed to any one, but was&#xD;
rather thinking aloud.  "For my life I don't know what to do.&#xD;
with her."&#xD;
- Place-her on board of one' of the ships of war, sir," suggested&#xD;
Wolsey; "it will be difficult to effect her escape from one ; while&#xD;
in the -oity she may elude the vigilance of guards."&#xD;
" That is the suggestion.  I will send her on board the George,&#xD;
and entrust her safe keeping to her old gray-headed captain, Grif-&#xD;
fith.  1ewill be an honorable and safe jailor for her, and can&#xD;
give her one of'his cabins. That affair is settled !"&#xD;
At that moment two or three gentlemen of his staff were&#xD;
announced, and Jenkins Wosley glided out of the apartment with&#xD;
the step andlook of a ma' who has been doinga disgraceful thing,&#xD;
and fears to meet the full gaze of honorable men.&#xD;

and taking the letter, placed it in the bottom of one of his etarse&#xD;

"If danger menaces, I cannot leave you, Miss Elizabeth, said&#xD;
the youth, respectfully and earnestly.&#xD;
"t You, will show but the sincerity of your friendship for me, by&#xD;
obeying," she answered, with an air of resolution.&#xD;
"I know I am presumptuous to hope, where I am so lowly and&#xD;
you so far above me, but--"&#xD;
Mere the speech of the young colonist was interrupted bya&#xD;
third knock, louder and more imperative than the last; kissing&#xD;
her hand respectfully, he obeyed the entreating command of her&#xD;
eyes, and instantly left the apartment.&#xD;
&#xD;
He did not, however, on reaching the hall, go out by the door&#xD;
by which he had an hour before entered, bearing a letter to the&#xD;
lady from the camp of the army outside, but alarmed for her safety&#xD;
by the loud knocking, he hurried to the upper entry, and went&#xD;
out upon a balcony, from which he could look down into the front&#xD;
yard and see who was at the front door. Upon discovering the&#xD;
English officer, who at that moment had called his men to break&#xD;
in the door, he flew to warn the young lady of the character of&#xD;
her visiters. But in descending the stairs he came upon the&#xD;
bayonets of the two soldiers who had come around by the rear.&#xD;
Stand ! you are our prisoner !" they cried, presenting their&#xD;
weapons close to his breast.&#xD;

he found a British sentinel on duty before it. The house itself&#xD;
was still, and he resolved to gain access to it that he might learn&#xD;
whether his fears were realized. To have questioned the sentry&#xD;
would have been to expose himself to suspicion. He, therefore,&#xD;
by a way well known to him as the bearer of letters to and from&#xD;
the maiden, gained a poplar tree that stood near the west end of&#xD;
the house. and by climbing it he reached the roof, through which,&#xD;
by a trap door, he descended softly into the apartments of the&#xD;
house. Upon reaching the parlor he found a light burning ; but&#xD;
as he was about to enter, he started back with a cry of horror..--&#xD;
Upon a table lay the corpse -of the invalid, just being laid out by&#xD;
two old women. The'escritoire was broken oen, and books. ,pa-&#xD;
pers and furniture strewn about in disorder.&#xD;
He was about to enter, forgetting the risk he would run, for he&#xD;
recognized. one of the old women as a bitter tory, when he heard&#xD;
one say to the other :&#xD;

" A pretty, white neck'll fit a hangman's rope as well as a dried&#xD;

These were questions which he could not answer. He was'&#xD;
about to enter the room'and ask them if they could tell him where&#xD;
she had been taken ; but an instant's reflection showed him the&#xD;
weakness of thus exposing himself; for he knew that he was sus-&#xD;
pected of being a spy, and that men were on the watch to detect&#xD;
him; and therefore did he:change his disguise every time he came&#xD;
into town. His uncertainty was, however, relieved in an unlooked-&#xD;
for manner.  The front door vras abruptly opened, and 'he only.&#xD;
had time to wthdraw into a shaded niche, when the captain and&#xD;

I may not be her lover, I will be her servant."  At the r  o  is&#xD;
life he 'become the bearer of her lett ers to the patriot -hiefs.&#xD;
For her sake he exposed himself to a dozen deaths. Without&#xD;
bops of her love, he devoted his very life to ler interests. .&#xD;
He knew that she had rejected Jenkins Wosley, with all his&#xD;
wealth. He had, accidentally, overheard part of their interview.&#xD;
He beard her say that :he would not and could not be tempted by&#xD;
wealth without worth; and that "a luke-warm    colonist .should&#xD;
never have her hand, though he were possessor of the Indies, and,&#xD;
&#xD;
19&#xD;
.had the manly beauty' of App~lo. "---Lawrence heard the bitter&#xD;
anathemas with which the defeated suitor left her presence ; and&#xD;
from that moment he looked on him as both his own enemy and&#xD;
that of Elizabeth H incock.&#xD;
When, therefore, he now saw him a few minutes before eight&#xD;
o'clock, idling about on the pier fromi which the captain wes to&#xD;
embark for the frigate, the idea flashed upon his mind that he was&#xD;
aware of the arrest, and he added, half aloud, " perhaps he has&#xD;
been an agent in it !"&#xD;
No sooner did this suspicion enter the. mind of the brave young&#xD;
colonist, than he resolved to watch him narrowly. In a few min-&#xD;
utes the captain who had made the arrest,, appeared at the end of&#xD;
the pier, and saluted Wosley, cordially.&#xD;

" That was an unfortunate arrest, last night, captain, eh is he&#xD;
said, in Lawrence's hearing.&#xD;
" Yes. It would seem so: I regretted it. She is a splendid&#xD;
girl! Her beauty and dignity overawed me ! I treated her as&#xD;
if she had been-a queen."&#xD;
" She can be haughty enough," answ ered Wosley.    The gen-&#xD;
eral did right in arresting her. She is the most dangerous person&#xD;
in Boston.&#xD;
"And most captivating.   By the girdle of Hebe! she -.fairly&#xD;
took my heart., She is not so much a prisoner as I agi!   Btu&#xD;

her."&#xD;

As he spoke the woman appeared. The officer called to a sear&#xD;
man, who was waiting by a boat at the foot of the pier stairs, who&#xD;
conducted the old crone on board.&#xD;
" I am going to the frigate, Percival," said Wosley. " Here is&#xD;
the generals permission,"&#xD;
"I should like your company."&#xD;
" Did you take her on board without trouble, last night ?'&#xD;
"Yes she went with us like a lady, I felt my conscience smi-&#xD;

Jenkins was awed, and felt his own insignificance; yet he thought.&#xD;
he never -saw her look so splendidly beautiful. He stood gazing&#xD;
upon her in a sort of stupid wonder.&#xD;

"Did he not know that I knew that this was his work ?  What&#xD;

by means of rope which hung from the taffrail, to swing himself a-&#xD;

followed by several strokes upon a bell. His heart leaped to his&#xD;
