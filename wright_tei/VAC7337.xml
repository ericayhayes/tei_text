THE incidents related in this tale, really and truly&#xD;
occurred, though not in the consecutive order in&#xD;
which they are placed.&#xD;
The mass of the Irish landlords having attained&#xD;
an unenviable pre-eminence, it was found necessary&#xD;
to concentrate. several characters in one individual,&#xD;
and make him the representative of his class: thus&#xD;
the Right-Rev. S. W. Biggs is in reality some super-&#xD;
latively bad landlords exhibiting in one mortal&#xD;
frame. It must not be inferred, however, that the&#xD;
picture is overdrawn, or that there could not be&#xD;
found one person in that class sufficiently wicked&#xD;
to bear the responsibility alone. Unhappily the&#xD;
fact of their being so. numerous is the very reason&#xD;
why one must be made to stand for many, otherwise&#xD;
the recital of each individual's inhuman execution&#xD;
of English laws (framed for the destruction ot a&#xD;
kindly, virtuous people, and cruel enough to disgrace&#xD;

savages, not to speak of their manifest injustice)&#xD;
would form a library in itself. Another cause also&#xD;
existed, which seemed to render this amalgamation&#xD;
a necessity : The writer was surprised to find that&#xD;
many atrocities perpetrated by landlords within&#xD;
the last twenty-five years were almost unknown in&#xD;
America, even to Irish people who had emigrated&#xD;
before that period ; thus the trial and legal murder&#xD;
of Bryan Seery, in Westmeath, had never been&#xD;
heard of by any one with whom the writer con-&#xD;
versed in this country during a period of seventeen&#xD;
years! Many other transactions detailed here, which&#xD;
happened under other tyrants, were equally un-&#xD;
known; and although the vast majority of the Eng-&#xD;
lish-speaking people of the United States.are natives&#xD;
of Ireland, or descendants of these persecuted .Celts,&#xD;
yet the evictions by Lord Plunket, the Protestant&#xD;
Bishop of Tuam, seem alone to have aroused a cry,&#xD;
of indignation throughout this land-thanks to the&#xD;
fearless zeal and energy of dear good Father ITavell,&#xD;
and the saintly, noble Archbishop of Tuam, who&#xD;
would not tamely witness the destruction of their&#xD;
flock. All honor to those Columbkills of the nine-&#xD;
teenth century ! In view of these facts, it appeared&#xD;
indispensable to'collect some of the skeletons of&#xD;
landed proprietors together, thrust them into one&#xD;
&#xD;
wolf's-hide, and hold the disgusting creature up&#xD;
for execration.&#xD;
After much trouble and correspondence, therefore,&#xD;
the writer obtained a file of the Dublin Nation con&#xD;
taming a full report of the trial and execution in&#xD;
February, 1846, at the town of Mullingar, County&#xD;
Westmeath, of Bryan Seery, for the murder of Sir&#xD;
Francis Hopkins, Bart., who was not murdered at&#xD;
all, having received a shot through his hat, instead&#xD;
of his Ieart, if he ever possessed such a sensitive or-&#xD;
gan. This noble baronet, then, under the title'of&#xD;
one not unknown to the crowbar brigade-Right&#xD;
Reverend Samuel Wilson Biggs, D. D., Lord Bishop '&#xD;
of Glengoulah, is the hero, and his deeds, inter-&#xD;
woven with others of his class, forni the groundwork&#xD;
of this tale.&#xD;
All the other characters introduced are real.,&#xD;
Margin, the agents a life likeness, if anything a&#xD;
trifle too flattering. Like all paitings, it conceals&#xD;
many of the blemishes and wrinkles so. visible in the&#xD;
original. The names of persons and places are&#xD;
changed for obvious reasons.&#xD;
The record of the O'Byrne family, as related by&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy to Biggs, is not their history. It&#xD;
is merely a fancy sketch.  The O'Byrnes have,&#xD;
indeed, a truly noble history, but its details are&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
DEAR READER, have you ever beenin the beautiful&#xD;
County of Wicklow, in Ireland ? I pity you if you&#xD;
have not, an d will pity you still nore if, having the&#xD;
means, you do not visit before you die that land of&#xD;
enchanting scenery-for Moore tells us (and I think&#xD;
you will admit he is pretty good authority),&#xD;
"There is not In this wide world a valley so sweet&#xD;
As that vale in whose bosom the bright waters meet."&#xD;
That vale is the Vale of Ovoca, so called from a&#xD;
stream of liquid silver bearing the same naie,&#xD;
which takes its rise in the neighboring hills, bounds&#xD;
from cliff to cliff into the lovely valley below, where,&#xD;
meeting the limpid Avon, they clasp each other in&#xD;
a bright and gurgling embrace. Soon disengaging&#xD;
itself, the Ovoca dashes forward, singing and tum&#xD;
bling as it runs through the picturesque village of&#xD;
"Wooden Bridge," then turning the little headland&#xD;

it seems to expand its bosom and move more slowly&#xD;
--no doubt out of courtesy to the honors paid it in&#xD;
flowing through the groves of Shelton, where the&#xD;
sweeping willow and the graceful larch bend their&#xD;
branches to kiss the beautiful stream as it passes.&#xD;
Emerging from those lovely shades it makes a curve&#xD;
by the lighthouse of Arklow, and with a joyous&#xD;
bound flings itself into the arms of " the Irish Sea,&#xD;
or St. George's Chaniel," which forins the eastern&#xD;
boundary of Ireland. Oh, happy, cloudless days of&#xD;
childhood ! How vividly ye impress the memory&#xD;
Many a sunny morning in summer have-I wandered&#xD;
in those enchanted g roves, with-a book you will&#xD;
think, of course; nothing of the kind-a goodly-sized&#xD;
basket on my arm, and a pair of scissors contained&#xD;
therein ; for, reader, my taste was not of the literary&#xD;
kind then, I assure you-to pick blackberries, or&#xD;
hunt for bird's nests, was then the bent of ny incli-&#xD;
nation. Armed, therefore, with the basket and scis-&#xD;
sors aforesaid (the latter was to save our hands from&#xD;
the swarms of little thorns which guarded the fruit),&#xD;
my sister and self committed great depredations on&#xD;
the blackberries (which, by the way, were the largest&#xD;
and most luscious of the kind I have ever tasted).&#xD;
Often has my sister-who was ever more piously&#xD;
inclined than I was-called to me from a neighbor-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing bush to stop and recite the "Angelus," as, clear-&#xD;
as the morning air, broke the tones of Shelton Abbey&#xD;
bell for six o'clock ; not, as of old, to call the faithful&#xD;
to prayer, but to summon the laborers to work on&#xD;
the estate of the Right-Hon. the Earl of Wicklow,&#xD;
whose magnificent country seat lay on the opposite&#xD;
side of the river. I see it all before me now, though&#xD;
more than thirty years have gone by-the clear,&#xD;
bright, sunny morning, the ever-verdant grass dot-&#xD;
ted with myriads of daisies and cowslips, the gentle&#xD;
kine moving slowly and browsing the sweet herbage,&#xD;
groups of sheep with tiny lambs nibbling or play-&#xD;
ing on the turf; the gurgling limpid river "murmur-&#xD;
ing a happy song " as it glides on to the sea, the&#xD;
graceful trees along its banks bending to catch the&#xD;
reflection of their own fair forms on its bosom, the&#xD;
hills of Shelton at one side of the river and Castle&#xD;
Howard on the other rising cone after cone, clothed&#xD;
to the very top with every variety of tree and shrub.&#xD;
To the east a break in the hills discloses the slender&#xD;
Minarets and turrets of Shelton Abbey towering&#xD;
from the distant groves; more distant still, the pret&#xD;
ty little town of Arklow, with its long line of fisher-&#xD;
men's huts stretching out to the beach; and, still&#xD;
beyond, the blue sea with its tiny crests of foam&#xD;
and mimic waves, scarcely rocking the little fishing-&#xD;

smacks, with which it is now covered, bent on their&#xD;
daily toil. The air is redolent with the perfume of&#xD;
wild-flowers. From every bush and brake thousands&#xD;
upon thousands of birds are pouring forth their joy-&#xD;
ous songs, and high in the heavens numberless larks&#xD;
are taking their melodious way-&#xD;
"Who, singing ever soar,&#xD;
And soaring ever sing."&#xD;
Two children have stopped their blackberry'feast to&#xD;
recite, in union with the whole Catholic world, the&#xD;
beautiful "Angelus Domini."  Their garb is black,&#xD;
for a few months before the loved voice that taught&#xD;
them that sweet Christian practice had ceased to be&#xD;
heard on earth ! Well! Pardon me, reader, when&#xD;
I found myself on the banks of the Ovoca I could&#xD;
not for my life but try to paint, however imperfectly,&#xD;
the beautiful panorama which memory conjured up;&#xD;
but now we will let it move on, and I will proceed&#xD;
to tell you my tale.&#xD;
About four miles from this lovely scene, at the&#xD;
base of, one of those cone-shaped hills, was a snug&#xD;
farm of about forty acres, held by one Anthony&#xD;
Byrne, as decent a man and as honest a neighbor as&#xD;
ever the sun shone on. Anthony, or, as he was usu-&#xD;
ally called, Toney Byrne, arose with the lark, and&#xD;
like that bird of melody went to, his work with a&#xD;
&#xD;
light heart, singing or whistling some sweet old&#xD;
melody of his native land, his "fiack" on his should-&#xD;
er, and his two stout farm-laborers bent in the same&#xD;
direction. Like the great majority of Irish peasants&#xD;
Toney Byrne led a blameless life. If he met -a&#xD;
neighbor going to work, or returning from it, some&#xD;
such conversation would- be sure to ensue as the fol-&#xD;
lowing: "God save you, Toney! "Oh, God save&#xD;
you, kindly, Ned! how are you the mornin'?"&#xD;
"Why, then, the Lord be praised, I was never better&#xD;
in my life; and how are you, and how is the woman&#xD;
that owns you?"&#xD;
"We're Ball pretty lively, thanks be to the great&#xD;
God, and to you for askin'."  "How is the crops&#xD;
wid you, Toney?"&#xD;
" Well, finely ; thanks be to God!" or as the case&#xD;
might be. "Why, then-indeed, Ned, they're migh-&#xD;
ty backward this season, the Lord of heaven be prais-&#xD;
ed! The upland hay turned out very short entirely,&#xD;
and I'm greatly afeard of the oats too-but sure we&#xD;
can't expect things to be always goin' right ; bedad&#xD;
I'm thinkin' we'd have ne'er a thought at all for&#xD;
th' other world if we didn't meet some little disap-&#xD;
pointment here, so we must only be satisfied when&#xD;
we know we did our best."&#xD;

whate will be short too; but as you say, when we&#xD;
did our part we can't help it, so welkim be the will&#xD;
of God."&#xD;
Every one who knows anything of the Irish peas-&#xD;
antry knows how common such dialogues are in&#xD;
every pai't of Ireland. The leading characteristics&#xD;
of the people. are gratitude to God in prosperity or&#xD;
adversity, and humble sul)mission to the Divine&#xD;
will under all trials and ci'constances.&#xD;
At, the conclusion of their frugal supper Toney&#xD;
and his family would give hearty thanks to God in&#xD;
the real old Catholic fashion, never forgetting to&#xD;
pray for the souls of the faithful departed. After&#xD;
supper all would gather around the bright turf fire&#xD;
to tell stories and crack jokes while the pipe was&#xD;
handed about.&#xD;
If a stranger happened to be present, which was&#xD;
very often, the case (for Toney Byrne, like a true&#xD;
Irishman, never closed his door to the poor or the&#xD;
stranger), he got the snuggest seat in the ample&#xD;
chimney corner ; then some of the neighbors would&#xD;
raise the latch and step in with " God save all here !"&#xD;
"God save you kindly, and you're welcome; sit&#xD;
down."&#xD;
"Faix, Barney," one of the youngsters would cry&#xD;
out, "you forgot to say barring the cat and the dog."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Sorra matter avic! let the poor brutes have&#xD;
pace; you oughtn't to be so hard on the animals&#xD;
anyhow, Mike.&#xD;
This sent the laugh round at Mike's expense, a&#xD;
young urchin of ten, who crept grinning up to his&#xD;
father's side on the hearth. I know of no place&#xD;
where a more social evening can be spent than in&#xD;
the kitchen of an Irish peasant farmer. Thrilling&#xD;
ghost stories, poetic fairy tales, and very frequently&#xD;
dissertations and arguments on history, for the Irish&#xD;
peas.ait is very fond of, and not at all ignorant of,&#xD;
historic lore.&#xD;
Napoleon le Grand is his great hero, principally&#xD;
because he English hated hi n; and after detailing&#xD;
and discussing us airious exploits, you are sure to&#xD;
hear, " Aye, Boney  as able for them all, and would&#xD;
bate the who    world if lie let the Pope alone."&#xD;
There ever one chimes in, and all are unanimous&#xD;
in pointing out how his power waned from the hour&#xD;
he medd e'd with the Holy Father, and how just it&#xD;
was lie should (lie in exile as.he caused the Sovereign&#xD;
Pontiff to die in a foreign land in his old age. Thus&#xD;
many a pleasant hour passed, and when bed-time&#xD;
came thel neighbors, wishing a kindly " good night,"&#xD;
would retire to their homes. Then Toney and his&#xD;
bustling, good-natured little wife, calling the house-&#xD;

hold together, would pull out the beads and recite&#xD;
the rosary before lying down to rest.&#xD;
A couple of times in the year the townlands of&#xD;
Glengoulah were visited in turn by Darby Wholahan,&#xD;
the blind piper, who drew melodious strains from a&#xD;
very respectable-looking, silver-keyed instrument,&#xD;
which he called the "Union Pipes," and which was&#xD;
a combination of the Scotch and Irish bagpipe. The&#xD;
most staid fool in the parish could not keep still&#xD;
while Darby perfom'ecl the " Peeler's Cap," or&#xD;
"Lord- Macdonald's IReel ;" and as for "The Hfun-&#xD;
ter's Jig," you'd give your oath you heard the fox&#xD;
running for his life, and the hounds in full cry after&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Darby was .kept going from one farm-house to&#xD;
another, all the neighbors assembling each evening&#xD;
where he was known to be, and the Terpsichorean&#xD;
performances on every floor were a triumph of grace&#xD;
and agility. Between the pauses in the dance&#xD;
Darby had an inexhaustible fund of anecdotes&#xD;
replete with humor; he could, besides, sing an&#xD;
excellent song, either comic or sentitnental, and&#xD;
had a great talent for recitation, so that it is no&#xD;
wonder every hand was extended and every heart&#xD;
bounded when Darby arrived. " Oh, God be with&#xD;
those happy days! Oh, God be with my childhood !.&#xD;
&#xD;
Every meeting passed off pleasantly and innocently,&#xD;
and each arose next m-orning refreshed for the day's&#xD;
work by the harmless and healthful recreation of&#xD;
the evening before.&#xD;
Thus passed the even tenor of Toney's life and&#xD;
his neighbors. They were not rich in this world's&#xD;
goods, but they wanted fbr nothing, having where-&#xD;
withal to- live upon, and enough besides to share&#xD;
with their poorer fellow-creatures--a little store may-&#xD;
be for cases of emergency, and immense treasures&#xD;
in Faith, Hope, and Charity. No doubt they had&#xD;
their faults too-who has riot ? but they were few,&#xD;
and so overlaid with virtues that they could scarcely&#xD;
be perceived.&#xD;
The landlord who owned this fine estate was Sir&#xD;
Charles Plover, Bart. He was, an absentee, and his&#xD;
property was managed with justness and kindness&#xD;
by Mr. De Courcey, a wealthy merchant who had&#xD;
extensive flour mills not far distant.. Mr. De&#xD;
Courcey watched over the interests of the tenantry&#xD;
like a wise and prudent man, knowing that the&#xD;
real interest of the landlord was, in the prosperity&#xD;
of the tenant. He had the best farm seeds brought&#xD;
from Dublin for their use, saw that their fields were&#xD;
properly drained, encouraged them to keep their&#xD;
houses neat and to train some creeping vine&#xD;

around them, for which purpose lie made presents&#xD;
to the farmers' wives and daughters of many a&#xD;
honeysuckle and woodbine.&#xD;
lie had hedges planted here, overtopping banks&#xD;
removed there, mountain rills widened and made&#xD;
to form water-courses for the use of the cattle and to&#xD;
carry off field drains, obliged them to sink wells,&#xD;
and all to have neat and well-kept gates and cattle-&#xD;
pens. By a properly-arranged mixture of justice,&#xD;
firmness and prudence, lie made Sir Charles Plover's&#xD;
estate the most prosperous both for landlord and&#xD;
tenant in the county of Wicklow, while the eye of&#xD;
the tourist was enraptured with the scene of tranquil&#xD;
beauty. On the sides of the hills. the white farm-&#xD;
houses gleamed from clumps of trees, trailing vines&#xD;
of the sweet-scented honeysuckle crept around the&#xD;
windows and rustic porch, the blue smoke curled&#xD;
high up in the air, the little vegetable garden with&#xD;
here and there a bed of cultivated flowers bordered&#xD;
with "London Pride" formed a bright patch, and&#xD;
helped the primnroses to scent the mountain breeze.&#xD;
Mr. De Courcey was not a Catholic, but lie was&#xD;
a gentleman, and presumed not to interfere with the&#xD;
faith of the tenantry. He respected those who&#xD;
lived up to the dictates of their consciences,&#xD;
and was often heard to speak in terms of high&#xD;
&#xD;
admiration, of the noble fidelity with. which the&#xD;
Catholics of Ireland clung to their faith through&#xD;
weal or woe.&#xD;
To say that Mr. De Courcey was respected and&#xD;
beloved by the tenants would be cold words; he&#xD;
was almost idolized. Second only in their affections&#xD;
to the venerable Father Esmond, and his -curate&#xD;
Father O'Toole, was the much-loved agent. His&#xD;
appearance amongst them ever brought a smile of&#xD;
welcome, while each busied him or herself to appear&#xD;
their best before "Mr. IDe Courcey, God bless him."&#xD;
What a pity that the fair face of nature should&#xD;
ever be overcast by a cloud ; but clouds and storms&#xD;
will come, dear reader, and so, taking a sheltered seat&#xD;
before it breaks upon us, and keeping our eyes fixed&#xD;
on God's good Providence, "who rules the whirl-&#xD;
wind and directs the storm," we will rest awhile and&#xD;
leave the outburst for another chapter.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
BEFORE I proceed further I must tell you about&#xD;
Toney's family-as likely a set of children as you.&#xD;
could meet with-two girls and three boys. .-Mar-&#xD;
garet, the eldest, was a hard-working, gentle-tem-&#xD;
pered girl, unobtrusively industrious, ever at hand&#xD;
when her mother wanted her, which was pretty&#xD;
nearly the whole day, for Mrs. Byrne was of a&#xD;
bustling, quick-tempered nature, but had the warm-&#xD;
est, and kindest heart in the world. Margaret was&#xD;
a tall, well-proportioned girl, with an open, smiling&#xD;
face, and the bloom of youth and health on her&#xD;
cheek. She was about 18 at the time my tale con-&#xD;
mences. Winifred, who was not yet 14, was a&#xD;
smaller figure, with a remarkably pretty face, in&#xD;
which drollery and roguery were the leading char-&#xD;
acteristics. She was a great pet with her father,&#xD;
who would shield her from her mother's anger&#xD;
when some piece of work allotted to her would be&#xD;
found untouched, or when she had played some prank&#xD;
on the old schoolmaster who came to teach thew three&#xD;
evenings in the week. "Whist, Kitty," he would&#xD;
&#xD;
say, "the girl is young; and if she is fond of playing&#xD;
tricks, the creature has no more harm in them nor&#xD;
a kitten." So Winnie went on playing pranks and&#xD;
laughing merrily. But the darling of his mother's&#xD;
heart was Andrew, the eldest boy, now about 12;&#xD;
he resembled his father in figure, being remarkably&#xD;
tall for his age; while his features were like his&#xD;
mother's, fair and frolicsome. He bore a strong&#xD;
resemblance to his sister Winnie, and. was ever&#xD;
ready to second her in all her pranks; but there was&#xD;
no son more docile or obedient than Andy, for all&#xD;
his devil-may-care ways and hasty temper. One&#xD;
day, when speaking confidentially of her family to&#xD;
a neighbor who had dropped in, Mrs. Byrne was&#xD;
known to say, "Margie and little Pat is the father&#xD;
on the sod-there's no trouble in life wid them,-&#xD;
they go smooth along, gainin' the good-will of every-&#xD;
body; deed, Mrs. Fehily; though I'm her mother,&#xD;
I will say Margie is worth her weight in gold; you&#xD;
could not cross her temper; but for all she has a&#xD;
dacent spirit too-there's not a mane thought nor a&#xD;
mane act in her carcass." "Mane!" cried Mrs.&#xD;
Fehily; "why, then, I'd. like to know where any-&#xD;
thing mane could be got in the Byrnes of Glengou-&#xD;
lah ! Sure we wouldn't know where to go look for&#xD;
dacency if we didn't find it in the ould stock."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7337-00000012"/>&#xD;
THE BYRNES OF GLENGOULATI.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I'm beholdin' to you, Mrs. Fehily, for your good&#xD;
word ; but, indeed, it's true what you say. Sure&#xD;
everybody knows the Byrnes is the oldest family in&#xD;
Wicklow, barrin the O'Tools, and though I know&#xD;
myself Toney is proud of them   too. Still he's&#xD;
always tellin' the children the way to prove they're&#xD;
of the ould stock is to be good, humble Christians,&#xD;
and to never forget how the Byrnes of -ancient&#xD;
times was hung, drawn, and quartered for bein'&#xD;
Catholics, but they kept their faith through thick&#xD;
and thin, though they lost their lands."&#xD;
"'Deed, Mrs. Byrne, it's often I heard my grand-&#xD;
father tellin' of all the hardships they met with&#xD;
from Croin'ell and his crew ; bad luck to their memo-&#xD;
ries, the black-hearted villains !"&#xD;
"Well, may God in his mercy keep the persecu-&#xD;
tion from our doors anyway; but I was tellin' you&#xD;
about the children. If Margie and Pat is like the&#xD;
Byrnes, there's Winnie and Andy and Mike has the&#xD;
very spirit of the Malones-iny own people."&#xD;
" Why, then, now, do you tell me so?"&#xD;
"Tell you so ! Two apples never grew more like&#xD;
one another than my Andy and his uncle-my poor&#xD;
brother, Andy Malone-that I christened him after;&#xD;
God rest his soul this day! Oh, Mrs. Fehily, dear!&#xD;

t -two !-there wasn't the natch of him in three&#xD;
baronies. I[Q was as tall and straight as an arrow-&#xD;
the Malones was all tall and likely, glory be to God ;&#xD;
it's after the Delanys, my mother's people, I take in&#xD;
my height. Well, he had a pair of shoulders on him.&#xD;
the breadth of your apron,, and sorra such a lad for&#xD;
tricks in the country round. he'd sing like a lark&#xD;
the minit he'd open his eye in the mornin'; and it's&#xD;
trying' the steps in a double or a reel he'd be while&#xD;
he'd be puttin''on him (dressing); then he'd kneel&#xD;
down and pray-I'll engage as fervent as any one-&#xD;
and be off to his work; but when breakfast time&#xD;
caine maybe we wouldn't all get our share. Before&#xD;
he'd go to the field again he'd put myself and Onny&#xD;
and Mary and Biddy (there was the four sisters of&#xD;
us grox\ing up) all in a heap a top of one another&#xD;
on the floor, and the spinnin' wheel a top of us again.&#xD;
My mother used to run after him, making' believe&#xD;
she was goin' to hit him a box, and he'd whisk her&#xD;
up in his arms, and run round and round the house&#xD;
with her, and then put her sittin' in her own chair&#xD;
in the chimbley corner and run off. We couldn't&#xD;
do a ha'porth but laughing' for an hour after, and my&#xD;
poor other holdin' her sides. He was as innocent&#xD;
as a child, for he'd stay a whole day, when it would&#xD;
be too wet to work, playin' wid little Norah and&#xD;

then he'd dance for the creatures. Oh, dear! oh,&#xD;
dear! glory be to the holy God! but it's hard' to&#xD;
live in this world at all." Here poor Mrs. Byrne,&#xD;
overcome by her feelings, rocked back and forth and&#xD;
sobbed in her apron, upon which Mrs. Fehily inquir.&#xD;
ed what happened himi "Happened him! They&#xD;
broke his heart, so they did. Didn't ould Wilson,&#xD;
the tithe proctor, come to take up the tithes one day,&#xD;
and my mother and himself had some words and he&#xD;
gave her the lie? Andy was just coming' in at the&#xD;
door on the minit when lie heard the word ; and, Mrs.&#xD;
Fehily, dear, it would do your heart good to see him&#xD;
leapin' on Wilson. Well, he bate him and kicked&#xD;
him till he cried for mercy. 'Now,' says he,  I'll&#xD;
tache you how to spake to a dacent woman,' says he,&#xD;
'you blood-suckin' varmint that's livin' by the plun.&#xD;
der of the honest and the hard workin' poor, yourself&#xD;
and your employers,' says he; 'be out of the house&#xD;
this minit, or I'll have your life,' says he. Wilson&#xD;
was glad enough to get leave to go; but before eve-&#xD;
nin' fell a whole possee of polis caine and took iy&#xD;
poor fellow away to prison. Och! Mrs. Fehily,&#xD;
asthore ! but that was the black night in our house;&#xD;
the neighbors had to hold my father when lie seen&#xD;
the polis puttin' handcuffs on his darlin' boy ; my&#xD;
&#xD;
poor mother fell off in a dead faint when she seen&#xD;
the polls coming' in, and well become my poor fellow&#xD;
but he tried to cQifort the father. 'Never mind,&#xD;
father dear,' says he, 'it won't be for long; I'll soon&#xD;
be back again wid. you all, plaze God,' says he.&#xD;
He was going to say, more, but they dragged him off.&#xD;
He was four months in prison before the trial came&#xD;
on, although the best of bail was offered for him-&#xD;
they said it was too great a crime to bate a tithe&#xD;
proctor, and they could not think of taking bail for&#xD;
it. When the trial came on you'd think he was the&#xD;
greatest villain that ever lived to hear the charges&#xD;
brought against him-it would frighten you to hear&#xD;
the papers read by the prosecutin' counsil; they said&#xD;
he was a dangerous character and must be made an&#xD;
example of. And when they said, 'stand up, An-&#xD;
drew Malone, and plead guilty or not guilty to these&#xD;
charges,' lie stood up as grand as an earl. 'If you&#xD;
mane,' says he, 'am I guilty of baitin' and kickin'&#xD;
the tithe proctor ?-I am,' says he; ' I gave him as&#xD;
good a kicking as ever he got, and the man doesn't&#xD;
live that I'd let give the lie to any dacent woman,&#xD;
let alone my own mother. I hope Wilson wont for-&#xD;
get the lesson I gave him in good manners,' says he.&#xD;
He was as brave as a lion and didn't care a fiv'pen-&#xD;
ny bit for the whole of them. A wild cheer and&#xD;

cries of 'bravo, Andy Malone !' rung through the&#xD;
court. The Judge, mighty angry, called for silence,&#xD;
and said if they done that any more he would have&#xD;
the court cleared. They then told my poor fellow&#xD;
to sit down and would not let him say another word,&#xD;
though he had no counsil; he would not let my fa-&#xD;
ther fee counsil, for he said it would be of no use,&#xD;
and sure it was true for him. They then sentenced&#xD;
him to twelve months' imprisonment and hard labor.&#xD;
Och ! but it was the sore year to us goin' in and out&#xD;
of prison tryin' to bring him the little comforts he&#xD;
was used to. Many's the fine turkey and pair of&#xD;
barn doors (fat fowl) we brought the jailor to get his&#xD;
good will for Andy, but he was trated nothing the&#xD;
better for it. He didn't care for the work, for he&#xD;
was as strong as a horse; but they put him with the&#xD;
riff raff of the prison on purpose to break Lis spirit,&#xD;
and well they did it. When that weary year was&#xD;
out and he was let out you wouldn't know him. He&#xD;
tried to laugh and joke as of old to comfort the&#xD;
mother, but she could not be deceived-she saw the&#xD;
change in him, and the light went out from her heart&#xD;
from that hour. The damp of the prison cell got&#xD;
into his bones; and the close confinement, but above&#xD;
all the keepin' company with house-breakers and&#xD;
horse4hieves, broke his heart. His cheek was pale&#xD;

and his step was heavy, and he faded and faded, and&#xD;
bbfore the harvest was all in he           hadn't a bit on his&#xD;
bodies and had to keep his bed; and by the.end of&#xD;
.October, when the laves was all fallin' in showers,&#xD;
and the wind was moan in' through - the deserted&#xD;

Mrs. Byrne, throwing         her apron      over her head and&#xD;
rocking    to  and   fro, gave     way   to   a burst of grief.&#xD;
The sympathizing         Mrs. Fehily, who         was weeping&#xD;
too, exclaimed indignantly, " Och ! then I pray this&#xD;
day that the vengeance of                  "&#xD;

*A similar case occurred in Carlow in (I thiuk) 183 or 1833. Two re-&#xD;
spectable farmers, brothers, who held land under a landlord named Watson,&#xD;
exercised their newly-acquired franchise by voting for the liberal candi-&#xD;
date. The landlord was enraged, and shortly after indicted them for niaim&#xD;
ing two horses, his property. They were lodged in jail-all bail refused ;&#xD;
and by some quibble of law their trial was postponed from one ass izes to&#xD;
another until they lay a whole year in prison: At length they were brought&#xD;
to trial, and the principal evidence against them was a woman whose&#xD;
character was so notoriously bal that there was a burst of indhgnation&#xD;
through the court when she was put upon the witness stand. The prison&#xD;
ers' counsel, on her cross-examination, made her contradict herself three&#xD;
times. The prosecuting counsel ordered her to retire, and the men were&#xD;
acquitted. The younger brother, a high-spirited young man, was so grieved&#xD;
by the associations to which they were exposed. apl the hardships of&#xD;
prison life, that he sank rapidly and died in a few weeks after his release I&#xD;
The witness, whose name was Anne Magee, her brother, and other mem&#xD;
hers of her family, had free quarters in Dablin Castle for years, and wer4&#xD;
regular informers for the Crown. The present writer has frequently seen&#xD;
her with a brace of pistols in her belt, and report said that she carried a&#xD;
dagger in her bosom.&#xD;

She never left him night nor day; and when he&#xD;
was gone she was like one stupified.&#xD;
The day of the berrin' she took a tremlin' all over,&#xD;
and we wanted her not to go, but she said she'd stay&#xD;
py him while ever he'd be above ground. When&#xD;
they were film' up the grave she stood by, and while&#xD;
by father and the rest of us, even to the neighbors,&#xD;
were cryin' like the rain, she never shed a tear, but,&#xD;

laid her by the side of Andy. Och! but ours was&#xD;

Mrs. Fehily that slipper-time was coming. Hastily&#xD;
picking up her ball of worsted which rolled upon&#xD;
the floor, and sticking her needles in the stocking&#xD;
she was knitting, she wished Mrs. Byrne a good&#xD;

met her husband and two sons returning from work,&#xD;
and they all trudged home together.&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
A sHoRT time after the conversation detailed in&#xD;
the last chapter, one fine Sunday, Toney Byrne and&#xD;
his family were coming down the hill after hearing&#xD;
mass in Glengoulah chapel, when they were over-&#xD;
taken by Ned Fehily and family. After the usual&#xD;
greetings, commenting on the sermon delivered by&#xD;
Father O'Toole, etc., etc., Toney asked Ned to let the&#xD;
women and children walk on, and to come with him&#xD;
and see the oat-field. So they crossed the ditch&#xD;
through an opening in the hawthorn and went over&#xD;
the farm.&#xD;
But few words had passed between them when&#xD;
Ned asked, "Why, then, Toney, is it true what I&#xD;
hear that you're goin' to get your little girl married ?"&#xD;
" Well, 'deed I dun know yet, Ned; she's speakin'&#xD;
to a boy of the Donohoes of Cool-a-glisson, in the&#xD;
county Wexford, and the mother is mighty partial to&#xD;
the match, but I didn't give in yet." "And why not,&#xD;
Toney? Sure I know Bartle Donohoe well, and&#xD;
a lane likely boy he is, and more betoken the child&#xD;
of as dacent a father and mother as any in the same&#xD;

county, though I know he's nomatch for one of the&#xD;
Byrnes if things was as they ought." " Oh! be&#xD;
dad, the sorra fault I have to find with him on that&#xD;
score, oh no ! I have a mighty great regard, indade,&#xD;
for the same boy; and sure Father Esmond tells me&#xD;
he got a great account of him entirely frojn his own&#xD;
parish priest. It isn't that at all; but you see, Ned,&#xD;
I have to look into the well-bein' of my little girl;&#xD;
and what I don't like is this: You see Tom Donohoe&#xD;
has four other boys besides Bartle, and I belave&#xD;
three daughters; and though lie has a fine well-&#xD;
stocked farm, and holds under Earl Fitzwilliam--&#xD;
one of the best landlords in Ireland-still and all&#xD;
if he goes to divide up his farm between the boys&#xD;
it will leave each of them only a strugglin' livelihood,&#xD;
and I think Margie can do better than that.; the&#xD;
colleen is young, and has plenty of time before her.&#xD;
So I told Bartle my mind a fortnight ago, and lie&#xD;

up his farm; so Bartle set off a Friday to see the&#xD;
eafi, and get a promise of the first chance in it. If&#xD;
God gives him luck it will be a great rise&#xD;
entirely for him, and plaze goodness I'll give him&#xD;
some help to stock it; but sure we don't know-it's&#xD;
all in the hands of the great God, and we must wait&#xD;
with patience, glory be to His holy name."&#xD;
Having inspected the oat, potato, and wheat crops,&#xD;
and expressed their hopes and fears on their appear-&#xD;
ance, Toney repaired to Fehily's farm, which was&#xD;
adjoining, to make the same inspection, and both&#xD;
then went to their respective homes.&#xD;
During the week Bartle Donohoe, the suitor of&#xD;
Margaret Byrne, came to inform her father of his&#xD;
interview with Earl Fitzwilliam, and his entire&#xD;
success.&#xD;
It was true that Pat Ianlon was resigning hi,&#xD;
farm ; and the earl wrote a letter to his agent, Cap-&#xD;
tain Johnson, requesting that Bartle Donohoe should&#xD;
have the preference before any one. He was quite&#xD;
delighted with the kind consideration with which&#xD;
the earl inquired after his tenants and their fami-&#xD;
lies, making inquiries also after their comforts, ho'&#xD;
ping the stock had escaped the sickness which was&#xD;
prevalent in a barony not far distant. A widowed&#xD;
tenant of his lordship, who had been deficient in her&#xD;
&#xD;
rent in consequence of the loss of several head of&#xD;
black cattle from this cause, came to ask an exten-&#xD;
sion of time while Bartle was there. The earl ex-&#xD;
pressed great regret at the losses she sustained, as-&#xD;
sured her she should not only have time, but that,&#xD;
knowing her to be an industrious improving tenant&#xD;
and a widow, she should be. allowed for every head&#xD;
of cattle she lost on presenting a statement of their&#xD;
value to the agent. " The captain did not act&#xD;
harshly, did he ?" said the earl. " Oh no, indeed,&#xD;
ny lord," replied the poor woman, while tears of&#xD;
gratitude filled her eyes,-" oh no, indeed; he only&#xD;
sent for his rent, and sure that's what he had a right&#xD;
to do ; but it fretted me not to have it for him, and&#xD;
I made up my mind I'd come and speak to your&#xD;
lordship. I knew I'd be sure to meet with considera-&#xD;
tion if I'd see you-may God shower his choicest&#xD;
blessings on your house this day ! Oh no, liy lord,&#xD;
the captain never distressed me a bit." "If he&#xD;
did, I'd distress him," said the earl. "I will not&#xD;
allow such acts to be done on my estate." * Both&#xD;
Bartle and the widow retired blessing God for giv-&#xD;
ing them so good a landlord. Oh, that the landed&#xD;
proprietors of Ireland could only be made to under-&#xD;
* This conversation actually occurred; but since then, unhappily, the&#xD;
papers report him to have become an exterminator like the rest. Such is&#xD;
the force of bad example.&#xD;

stand their own interests! If they would but make&#xD;
themselves acquainted with the character of the&#xD;
people over whom they exercise so much power, and&#xD;
then act towards them with simple justice, showing&#xD;
that consideration for their feelings which God cer-&#xD;
tainly intended one human being to have for anoth-&#xD;
er, what a life of inborn happiness would they not&#xD;
enjoy in this life, not to speak of their prospects in,&#xD;
the life to come!&#xD;
Toney Byrne had now no further opposition to&#xD;
make to his daughter's marriage, and accordingly&#xD;
Margaret and Bartle Donohoe were married in about&#xD;
ten days from his interview with Lord Fitzwilliain.&#xD;
They had a genuine Irish wedding ; the table was&#xD;
laid in the long barn, graced with many fine tur-&#xD;
keys, geese, chickens, rounds of beet; sirloins of ditto,&#xD;
plum puddings, apple dumplings, every kind of&#xD;
cakes, fruits, etc., and wine and whiskey ad libitum.&#xD;
But I presume most of my readers have been to Irish&#xD;
weddings before now, and it is unnecessary to describe&#xD;
how the venerable Father Esmond sat at the head of&#xD;
the table, how Father O'Tool occupied the next seat&#xD;
of distinction, how the parish priest blessed and cut&#xD;
the wedding cake, helping the bridesmaid to the first&#xD;
cut, how she made believe to be eating but reserved&#xD;
the greater part to divide amongst her young friends&#xD;
&#xD;
for the purpose of dreaming on it, how when the&#xD;
priest retired the tables were cleared away, and the&#xD;
fiddlers and pipers and dancers all commenced in ear.&#xD;
nest, how they danced in the barn and in every room&#xD;
in the house until the small hours of the morning,&#xD;
when the guests, after many affectionate good-byes,&#xD;
took their departure, praying long life and happiness&#xD;
to the young couple. My readers have enjoyed all&#xD;
this before, and I therefore merely glance at it.&#xD;
A few days after the wedding Bartle Donohoe-took&#xD;
his bride to his father's, where they were to remain&#xD;
until his own farmhouse was vacated,&#xD;
The hiuling home was another scene of festivity.&#xD;
Her father, eldest brother, and some near relatives,&#xD;
accompanied them. All rode on horseback; Mar-&#xD;
garet was mounted on a pillion behind her husband.&#xD;
Some miles from Donohoe's farm Bartle's fate, his&#xD;
two oldest brothers,'and a band of neighbors, came&#xD;
to meet them on horseback and formed a guard of&#xD;
honor to welcome the young bride, who blushingly&#xD;
thanked them for their attention, and smiled through&#xD;
the tears she had been shedding all day after parting&#xD;
with her mother and sister.&#xD;
"All the world and his wife " were assembled at&#xD;
the farm, and another joyous scene similar to the&#xD;
wedding took place. Next day, after many tears&#xD;

fond embracings, and blessings on his child, Toney&#xD;
Byrne and his escort returned to Glengoulah. They&#xD;
passed Mr. De Courcy's mills on their wvay home,&#xD;
and met Tom Moody, the under steward, coming out&#xD;
of the office. Calling Toney one side he told him&#xD;
strange news. Mr. De Courcy had received letters&#xD;
from London that morning, announcing the death&#xD;
of Sir Charles Plover. He had-been killed in a duel&#xD;
'by a colonel in her majesty's life-guards, with whom&#xD;
he had a dispute at play. The melancholy event&#xD;
took place near Dieppe, in France, whitheihey had&#xD;
gone to evade the law. Sir Charles Plover had&#xD;
never married, consequently the estate must pass&#xD;
into the hands of the nearest of kin, who was his&#xD;
first cousin, the Rev. Samuel Wilson Biggs, who&#xD;
was rector of Christ Church, Nottingham, England.&#xD;
Poor Toney Byrne heard this news with a sad&#xD;
heart, for though the landlord was nothing to him-&#xD;
none of the tenantry had ever seen him-still he&#xD;
foreboded evil the moment he heard the new land-&#xD;
lord was an Anglican minister. "I wonder will Mr.&#xD;
De Courcy act as agent still, Mr. Moody?" asked&#xD;
Toney of the steward. "That's more than any of&#xD;
us can tell, Mr. Byrne; but I don't see any reason&#xD;
why he wouldn't-I'm sure lie knows the property&#xD;
better than any one, and he understands the people-&#xD;
&#xD;
unless he gets tired of it and gives it up himself. I&#xD;
think the new landlord ought to be very glad to give&#xD;
it to him."  " God grant he may keep it, then," sail&#xD;
Toney, fervently, "for he's a fair and honorable&#xD;
gentleman."&#xD;
Poor Mrs. Byrne had been inconsolable from the&#xD;
time she parted with her dear child, and renewed&#xD;
her sorrow when she saw her husband.returning&#xD;
without her; but she soon dried her eyes when Toney&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Don't be foolish, Kitty; give thanks to God that&#xD;
your daughter has a dacent boy and a comfortable&#xD;
home under a good landlord ; not at all like her&#xD;
father and mother, I'm ,afraid. I met Tom Moody&#xD;
at the mills below, and he tells me news came from&#xD;
London this morning' that Sir Charles is dead, and&#xD;
the new landlord is a Protestant minister; so God&#xD;
between us and harm, this dayl But, Kitty, my&#xD;
heart bodes no good to ourselves or our neighbors.&#xD;
I'mii afraid there's a black cloud gatherin' a top of&#xD;

"Oh, Christ protect us ! Toney, avic!" exclaimed&#xD;
his wife, arising from  her seat. with staring eyes.&#xD;
"Is it the truth you're spakin' ; or are you only&#xD;

"lBedad, it's the truth I'm telliii' you, Kitty; and&#xD;
sorry I am to have to tell it."&#xD;
"Oh the cross of Christ about us and preserve us !"&#xD;
And Kitty made the holy sign on her forehead, lips,&#xD;
and breast, and courtesied devoutly. "Och, wirrah,&#xD;
wirrah, this day! Luck nor grace can't come where&#xD;
one of them black divils has any hand-God forgive&#xD;
me-but sure I know the breed of old, Don't I&#xD;
mind when my poor brother Andy was put in for&#xD;
beatin' the tithe proctor-God rest his soul, amen !"&#xD;
(Mrs. Bryne certainly meant her brother's soul, not&#xD;
the tithe proctor's). "Didn't my mother go to the&#xD;
minister to ask him to spake a word for the poor&#xD;
boy, seen' he was young and hot in himself, and&#xD;
was aggravated by reason of her bein' offended.&#xD;
Didn't the ould hypocrite snuffle through his nose&#xD;
and tell her she reared her son bad ; that she ought&#xD;
to tache him to be meek and humble, and to folly&#xD;
the scriptures, and if he was struck on one cheek to&#xD;
turn the other ? My poor mother was the mildest&#xD;
and pacefulest woman that ever lived. You'd won-&#xD;
der if you saw how patient and gentle she looked.&#xD;
To think any one could have the heart to spake that&#xD;
way to her, and she in trouble !-she riz up and&#xD;
walked from the room without another word, she&#xD;
was chokin'."&#xD;
&#xD;
Young Andy Byrne, who was listening to his&#xD;
mother with flashing eyes and burning cheeks, said&#xD;
quickly: "Mother, who was with my grandmother&#xD;
when he said that? "  " No one, alanna ; she was&#xD;
loath to take any one with her, afraid they might re-&#xD;
fuse to let her see the minister if there was another&#xD;
by."&#xD;
"I wish I was by, and to be -as big as I am now;&#xD;
I'd give him a rap in his ould jaw, and I'd see if he'd&#xD;
turn th' other side. "&#xD;
"Oh whist, Andy, avic machree !" said his moth-&#xD;
er with a shudder; and drawing him towards her she&#xD;
laid his head on her bosom, and passing her hand&#xD;
through his fair clustering hair, she made the sign of&#xD;
the cross on his forehead, murmuring fervently:"God&#xD;
bless my own bouchleen bawn, and mark him to&#xD;
grace, and preserve him from sin, accidents, and&#xD;
dangers."&#xD;
"Musha, mother 1" exclaimed Andy, jumping up&#xD;
and cutting a caper on the floor; "one would think&#xD;
I was goin' to kick the minister now, you're so fright-&#xD;
ened; 'deed if I was with my grandmother that day&#xD;
I'd give him a polthogue,'just to see how he'd take&#xD;
it; ho's too ould now if he'd be alive at all, but I&#xD;
suppose the divil got him long ago."&#xD;
" Oh, fie upon you, Andy, honey! Don't talk that&#xD;

" Och musha, mother asthore! -Don't I know you.&#xD;

but sui I know very well God Almighty has no&#xD;
hand in such ould varmint and hypocrites, and he&#xD;
must belong to one side or the other; anyway it's.&#xD;
well for his onild jaw I wasn't near him that day.&#xD;
IHooroosh ! there's the spotted calf runnin' through the&#xD;
meadow like mad." And away bounded Andy in high&#xD;
glee for the chase. His mother looked after him with&#xD;
a mixture of pride and sadness. Turning from the&#xD;
door, she said to herself: "Well, hasn't he the noble&#xD;
sperit all out?  Thanks and praises be to the great&#xD;
God for all things ! He's a Malone to the backbone."&#xD;
"Tony, who had lit his pipe after enteriing the house,&#xD;
sat back in the chimney-corner. 'Keeping his eyes&#xD;
fixed on the fire, and being entirely absorbed in puff-&#xD;
ing and watching the blaze as it flickered in and out&#xD;
of the turf pile, he heeded not what was passing be-&#xD;
tween his wire and son. Advancing now to meet&#xD;
her, as she turned from watching Andy, he said:&#xD;
"iKitty, I'm  after goin' over in my mind the&#xD;
way we're in at present, and I don't like how things&#xD;
look, but I see no way of bettering ourselves ; so I&#xD;
come to the conclusion that the best thing we can do.&#xD;
&#xD;
is to remember we're in the hands of God, and to go&#xD;
on doin'-our duty and 1 ve it all to Him. Thanks&#xD;
be to His holy name we've everything snug and com-&#xD;

whet need we care ? We never seen Sir Charles's&#xD;
face, and maybe this mae would stay in England too,&#xD;
and lave the estate to be managed by Mr. De Courcy,&#xD;
and sure, if he does, it wx ill make no differ to us who i-s&#xD;
landlord ; howsomever, let it go what way it will, we&#xD;
can't better it by frettin' about it, so welcome be the&#xD;
will of God."&#xD;
Poor Kitty tried hard to take the same philosophic&#xD;
view of affairs as her husband ; but it was plain her&#xD;
spirit chafed under the baro idea of holding their&#xD;
farm, which belonged to the Brynes, father and son,&#xD;
for generations, at the will of a member of that body&#xD;
which made itself most obnoxious to the people in all&#xD;
parts of the country, and which poor Kitty had good&#xD;
reason to dread as the bitterest enemy of her faith&#xD;
and race. She therefore merely shook her head,&#xD;
saying with a sigh : " Maybe so, astihore ; maybe so ;&#xD;
God is good !" and calling Winefred to her they took&#xD;
their snow-white pails and went to the byre to milk&#xD;

CHAPTER lV.&#xD;
ABOUT a month after the wedding of Margaret&#xD;
Byrne her mother and sister were busy spinning&#xD;
away to make a stock of house linen for the winter,&#xD;
Mrs. Byrne having sent a chest full to Margaret as&#xD;
her mother's wedding gift; and hei stock being&#xD;
greatly reduced thereby, they were working away&#xD;
to replace it, when a horse and rider turned into the-&#xD;
front yard, and stopping at the porch the rider&#xD;
alighted. He was a stout portly man, apparently&#xD;
about fifty years of age, with a mild benevolent&#xD;
countenance, his hair slightly sprinkled with silver,&#xD;
and his whole air, garb and bearing carrying unmis-&#xD;
takable evidence of the true gentleman. Mrs. Byrne,&#xD;
hurriedly calling Mike to hold- the horse, ran out,&#xD;
and, courtesying, welcomed Mr. 'De Courcy to the&#xD;
farm. Taking off his hat he entered the farm-house,&#xD;
saluted Winefred kindly, and, taking a seat, comt-&#xD;
plimented her on her industry, inquired what she&#xD;
had been spinning (for Winnie arose to make obei-&#xD;
sance on his entrance, but did not through politeness'&#xD;
resume her noisy occupation), and whether she found&#xD;
&#xD;
it productive; asked Mrs. Byrne after her husband&#xD;
and the boys, and what progress they were making;&#xD;
inquired how the young summer stock got on, and&#xD;
whether she still bore off the palm for her butter,&#xD;
poultry, etc. Mrs. Byrne gave him all the satisfac-&#xD;
tion she could. He admired the neat arrangements&#xD;
of the flower beds in the grass plot before the door,&#xD;
and seemed highly pleased with the look of comfort&#xD;
and industry which the whole place presented, not&#xD;
forgetting to note the flitches of bacon and coils of&#xD;
hogs' puddings suspended from  the ceiling. He&#xD;
then told Mrs. Byrne they were going to have a res-&#xD;
ident landlord.&#xD;
Unlike Sir Charles Plover, who had never been in&#xD;
Ireland since he was a boy, the Rev. Mr. Biggs was&#xD;
coming to reside amongst them. Orders had been&#xD;
received to put Glengoulah Castle in imnruediate&#xD;
repair, and artizans of all kinds were coming to&#xD;
decorate it in the highest style of art. Splendid&#xD;
furniture was ordered from Paris, and regular&#xD;
suite of English servants coining to take charge&#xD;
of all domestic arrangements. Mr. Biggs ex-&#xD;
pected to be settled in his future residence by&#xD;
Christmas.&#xD;
" I understand," said Mr. De Courcy, " he has ef-&#xD;
fected an exchange with the present rector of this&#xD;

parish, and intends to rule in the double capacity of&#xD;
landlord and rector."&#xD;
" Well, the Lord break hard fortune before us&#xD;
But I'm mighty sorry to hear it, your honor; I'm&#xD;
afraid luck and grace and happiness are leaving' us&#xD;
behind them ;" and poor Mrs. Byrne rocked to and&#xD;
fro, as was her wont when her mind was troubled.&#xD;
"Oh, don't say that, Mrs. Byrne," said the agent,&#xD;
cheerfully. "Don't you know one of the worst evils&#xD;
of Ireland is absenteeism, or the landlord making his&#xD;
residence in a foreign land and not looking plerson-&#xD;
ally after the condition of his tenantry ? And now&#xD;
Mr. Biggs is going to repair that e-vil by residing&#xD;
amongst you all, and watching over your interests.",&#xD;
" Oh no, sir; it may be true what you say, that a&#xD;
landlord has a right to look to his tenants. If they&#xD;
all done it, then one would be ashamed of the other&#xD;
not to act like a gentleman ; but where there's only&#xD;
one they're more like to be a tyrant. Anyway, may&#xD;
God long preserve your horor! We didn't know the&#xD;
bad of an absentee landlord while we had you. Oh,&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy, dear! sure you won't lave us?"&#xD;
" I really cannot tell yet, Mirs. Byrne. I should&#xD;
be very sorry, indeed, to part with the tenantry of&#xD;
Glengoulah estate,'for I have found them thoroughly&#xD;
upright, peaceable people, kind neighbors, and good&#xD;
&#xD;
friends. I really feel a kind of affection for every&#xD;
one on the estate, and I believe they love me too."&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy's voice trembled as he said the latter&#xD;
words. It was evident (though he did not express it)&#xD;
he boded no good from the clerical landlord. As&#xD;
for poor Mrs. Byrne, she and Winnie cried outright,&#xD;
and could not speak a word. " However, it is all&#xD;
foolish to think on it yet," said Mr. De Courcy,&#xD;
brightening up. " We may be pleased all round by&#xD;
the change. The English landlords are very kind&#xD;
and just to their tenantry in their own country, and&#xD;
Mr. Biggs inmay be one of the best of them for aught&#xD;
we know.   Remember, I know as little about him&#xD;
as any of you. Rest assured Mrs. Byrne, I shall not&#xD;
give up the management of the estate as long as I&#xD;
can retain it with honor to myself and good to the&#xD;
tenantry. Please tell Byrne to bring his lease to&#xD;
my office during the course of the week, as I am&#xD;
putting my affairs in order."  And so taking a amil-&#xD;
ing "adieu, he patted Mike on the head, slipped a&#xD;
half-crown into his hand unknown to his mother,&#xD;
and mounting his horse rode away.&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy, after leaving Toney Byrne's farm,&#xD;
rode on about three miles over the beautiful " Cas-&#xD;
cade mountain," as it was poetically and truthfully&#xD;
named, for hundreds of tiny waterfalls came bound-&#xD;

ing through the variegated shrubs, over moss-covered&#xD;
rocks, and made the hills musical with their murmur-&#xD;
ing glee as they rushed down to meet the Avon&#xD;
and flow into the lovely vale of Ovoca. Beyond&#xD;
this hill, and between it and another cone-shaped hill,&#xD;
crowned on top with a clump of mountain ash, was&#xD;
a verdant plain about a quarter of a mile wide.&#xD;
In the centre of this plain nestled a large thriving&#xD;
village, almost pretending to be a town (in America&#xD;
it would be called a city). here was a green where an&#xD;
annual cattle-fair was held, and at the end of this&#xD;
green stood a goodly-sized stone building of cruci-&#xD;
form shape, destitute of ornament save a stone cross&#xD;
of modest dimensions at the termination of the ga-&#xD;
ble, which faced the entrance. Over the principal&#xD;
door, which was a double one grained in oak, were&#xD;
the initials I. H. S., so well known to every Catho-&#xD;
lic to signify "Jesus, Saviour of men." The back of&#xD;
this building was shaded by a grove of oak, elm, and&#xD;
ash-trees, commingled. Beside it stood a magnifi-&#xD;
cent elm towering above all, and bearing high up in&#xD;
its branches a bell of humble size, from which a&#xD;
simple rope most unpoetically dangled, or was tied&#xD;
around the trunk ; nevertheless. that modest bell&#xD;
made music amongst the mountain echoes, as from&#xD;
its Jeafy spire it called the faithful children of the&#xD;

The ground on which this building stood covered a&#xD;
considerable space, and was enclosed by a rustic pa-&#xD;
ling, which could now be scarcely discerned through&#xD;
the thickly-interlaced hedge of sweet-brier and wild&#xD;
roses. Within this enclosure, and all around the&#xD;
building, with the exception of the neatly-gravelled&#xD;
pathway, the grass was thick, soft as Genoa velvet,&#xD;
and literally bespangled with daisies and buttercups.&#xD;
Long green mounds were strewn around: some with&#xD;
head-stones, simple and quaint enough; some with a&#xD;
plain stone cross ; some with a rose-bush at the head;&#xD;
but the greater number with no mark save that&#xD;
known to the eye of affection, which never makes a&#xD;
mistake. All told "the short and simple annals of&#xD;

hills. That substantial-looking cottage beside the&#xD;
chapel, embowered amongst the trees, with its bright&#xD;
flower-garden in front, is the residence of the be-&#xD;
loved parish priest of Tinmanogue and his almost&#xD;
equally beloved curate. The hillsides and the plains&#xD;
around are dotted with farm-houses and the cottages&#xD;
of the farm laborers, all bearing the same look of&#xD;

nogue let the bridle fall loosely on the neck of his&#xD;
horse, and turning to look on every side, surveyed&#xD;
the lovely prospect with feelings of pleasure and&#xD;
regret. He felt that inward satisfaction which every&#xD;
just man feels ir looking upon the effects of his&#xD;
good works, and   then came the sense of deep&#xD;
regret which he ,could not shake -off; for he knew&#xD;
he would soon be as a stranger amongst those farms&#xD;
whose prosperity he had watched with paternal care;&#xD;
and though he well knew lie would ever live in the&#xD;
warm affections of the grateful people, he also knew&#xD;
they would soon be surrounded by trials from which&#xD;
he could not extricate them.&#xD;
Arriving at the shady cottage he was shown into&#xD;
the modest parlor. The furniture was plain, sub-&#xD;
stantial, and beautifully clean. It bore a strong&#xD;
resemblance in many points to Goldsmith's celebrat-&#xD;
ed room, for the sanded floor was there, and the&#xD;
clock ticking behind the door; the green boughs&#xD;
were in the fire-place, and the chest of drawers con-&#xD;
triving to pay a double debt-not in the same sense,&#xD;
however, for it was not a bed either by night or by&#xD;
day; but the top part.was a writing-desk and bureau,&#xD;

being the depository of the parish registries, and all&#xD;
other important papers, while the under part was a&#xD;
chest of drawers; it was of old fashioned mahogony,&#xD;
and had massive handles and ornamental key-holes&#xD;
of the brightest brass. In place of "the twelve&#xD;
good 'rules and royal game of goose," the walls&#xD;
were hung with a plain, neat paper, and suspended&#xD;
thereon were some rare pictures-for Father Esmond&#xD;
was a lover of the beautiful in art, and brought those&#xD;
with him from France. Ireland in his young days&#xD;
had no means of educating her sons for the priesthood,&#xD;
as the odious penal laws were still in force. Father&#xD;
Esmond, therefore, had been sent, with many other&#xD;
students, to France, to study his ecclesiastical course,&#xD;
and had returned a learned and holy priest.&#xD;
Between the windows was an exquisite engraving&#xD;
of the " Ecce Homo."   Over the bureau a well-&#xD;
executed copy of Carlo Dolci's " Holy Family."&#xD;
Over the sideboard a fine engraving of Raphael's&#xD;
"Last Supper." In. the recesses of the fire-place&#xD;
were the "Annunciation" and the " Baptism of Our&#xD;
Lord," both matches, finely finished, and in old-&#xD;
fashioned oval frames. But the masterpiece of all,&#xD;
and the glory of the old pastor's heart, was an old&#xD;
oil painting over the mantelpiece-it was the " Re-&#xD;
pentance of St. Peter," and was indeed a gem.&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy, who was an enthusiastic admirer&#xD;
of the fine arts, stood entranced before it for some&#xD;
time, and then passed to the others. Looking&#xD;
through a side window he saw an equally fine living&#xD;
picture. A venerable man, evidently more than&#xD;
eighty summers, with a benign and smiling counte-&#xD;
nance, was standing beside a clear pond in the hol-&#xD;
low of a verdant field. He was a little, above the&#xD;
middle height and of a rotund form, his dress was&#xD;
black save a pair of dark-gray stockings which en-&#xD;
eased his stout, well-formed legs, which, whenever&#xD;
he went abroad, or expected company, were again&#xD;
covered by black-cloth leggings, terminating in a paii&#xD;
of thick shoes fastened by silver buckles of a depart-&#xD;
ed age. On his head he wore the three-cornered&#xD;
tonsure cap peculiar to his sacred office ; his long&#xD;
snow-white hair flowing underneath was stirred by&#xD;
the gentle breeze. In his hand he held a small bas-&#xD;
ket from which he scattered wheat and breadcrumbs&#xD;
to a numerous flock of geese, ducks, and chickens,&#xD;
alternately scolding, petting, and laughing heartily&#xD;
at the scramble amongst the fowls. A couple of aris-&#xD;
tocratic ducks, disdaining to enter the crowd of beg-&#xD;
gal's, stood a little apart with an eye cocked up, as&#xD;
much as to say, " here we are, waiting in dignified&#xD;
expectation." They were now addressed: "Indeed,&#xD;
&#xD;
then, you shall, Juno, have some nice crumbs, yourself&#xD;
and Ceres, just because you are not fighting about&#xD;
it. Down, Cesar ; down, sir;" and away went&#xD;
ducks and geese plunging into the pond, while the&#xD;
chickens vith extended wings ran screaming away&#xD;
to the barn-yard. This commotion amongst them&#xD;
was excited by Mrs. Malone opening the little yard-&#xD;
gate leading to the field to tell his reverence how a&#xD;
visitor awaited him, contrary, however, to the express&#xD;
injunctions of Mr. De Courcy, who assured the&#xD;
house-keeper he was in no hurry, and would prefer&#xD;
awaiting the leisure of Father Esmond.&#xD;
Mi's. Malone, after delaying a little, got on the fidg-&#xD;
ets, and the moment she opened the gate out bounded&#xD;
Cesar, a splendid mastiff, who had been wistfully&#xD;
watching the gate ever since his master's egress, and&#xD;
now sent the poor chickens flying in all directions.&#xD;
Father Esmond entered the house immediately.&#xD;
" My dear friend, Mr. De Conrcy," said he, extending&#xD;
both hands; "I am quite rejoiced to see you; you&#xD;
are heartily welcome to Tinmanogue; bless my soul&#xD;
how glad I am to see you!' And you are here some&#xD;
time, Mrs. Malone tells me, and would not let Ine be&#xD;
called-now what's that for? You wanted to surprise&#xD;
me, did you ?"  His eye now caught a stray glance&#xD;
of Mr., De Courcy's wandering over the fire-place.&#xD;

&#xD;
' AhM. !  I see it all now; I have the secret. You.&#xD;
were examining iny 'St. Peter'."  Mr. De Courcy&#xD;
pleaded guilty. "Well, I forgive you-it is not&#xD;
every day you meet with a picture like that. My&#xD;
dear sir, that picture would take whole weeks to&#xD;
view properly. Many an hour I remain before it&#xD;
and yet dec:cover new beauties continually. Now&#xD;
just stand in this light and catch the expression of&#xD;
that face. Look! there is true repentance for you!"&#xD;
" Indeed, Father Esinond, I never saw anything&#xD;
more perfect; he seems truly the rugged fisherman.&#xD;
I fancy he has just moored his smack, awaiting the&#xD;
morrow's dawn to be off again."&#xD;
Yes, just so; the weather-beaten fisherman-.&#xD;
his hair seems to stand out as if still blown about-&#xD;
by the' gales from lake Galilee; his garment flies&#xD;
open and bares his breast to tho breeze, but lie heeds&#xD;
not all that. Oh, my friend! just look at those&#xD;
sun-embrowned hands clasped together so closely;&#xD;
don't you think they seem to quiver with the an-&#xD;
guish of that soul upon which Jesus has cast a&#xD;
pitying yet reproachfulglance? Don't those ears still&#xD;
seem to ring with the crowing of that cock which&#xD;
first warned him of his terrific sin? those lips seem&#xD;
trying to utter words of heartfelt sorrow, but can-&#xD;
not for the choking -sobs ?  Then look at those tears&#xD;
&#xD;
streaming down the furrowed cheeks; those eyes&#xD;
incessantly filling, raised to heaven with an expres-&#xD;
sion of intensest love for his Divine Master, and&#xD;
agonizing contrition for having denied Him. Oh,&#xD;
Peter! Peter ! how many of us follow you in your&#xD;
fall; how few in your repentance!&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy, who seemed spellbound by the elo-&#xD;
quence of his host, now turned to look at him. His&#xD;
cap was in his hand, his white hair flowing lack,&#xD;
and his aged eyes filled with tears: he looked almost&#xD;
as fine a picture as the blessed Peter himself. A&#xD;
new emotion filled the heart of Mr. De Courcyl; he&#xD;
could not account for it, but he seemed to feel him-&#xD;
self quite insignificant, and would fain have re-&#xD;
mained silent and unobserved. Soon Father Es-&#xD;
mond, wiping his eyes, cried out: "Bless my soul!&#xD;
that picture makes me forget everything.    Sit&#xD;
down, my dear sir, sit down; you will pardon the&#xD;
forgetfulness of an old man. I hope Mrs. De Courcy&#xD;
and the little people are well. How are matters&#xD;
progressing at Glengoulah ? I suppose the old castle&#xD;
is putting on its grand look,.as of old."&#xD;
"Yes, indeed; the castle and the demesne of Glen-&#xD;

wish they were about to be occupied by some .ne&#xD;
worthy of such a princely inheritance. Indeed,&#xD;

TIE BYRNES OF GLENGOULAH-&#xD;
&#xD;
Father Esmond, I came to visit you to-day for the&#xD;
purpose of having a conversation with you on this&#xD;
very subject. I am anxious to know if you have&#xD;
any idea who this Biggs is; have you heard anything&#xD;
of him? "&#xD;
" I.have not the slightest suspicion who he is; nor,&#xD;
indeed, do I much care. As long as you are the&#xD;
agent we don't care who the landlord is, and for this&#xD;
reason I never made an inquiry on the subject ;&#xD;
but there's the old man's selfishness breaking out&#xD;
again! I'm forgetting how very unpleasant it&#xD;
would be for you if he should happen to be a dis-&#xD;
agreeable man. I wish he had stayed where. he was&#xD;
born."&#xD;
" Well, Father Esmond, I had a suspicion from&#xD;
the first that he was the person of whom I heard my&#xD;
cousin William speak when he came home from&#xD;
Oxford. I thought the name was the same, but not-&#xD;
feeling certain I wrote my cousin on the subject,&#xD;
related what I had heard of the character of our&#xD;
new landlord, and begged he would describe, as ac-&#xD;
curately as possible, his old class-mate at Oxford.&#xD;
He had started for Germany before my letter&#xD;
reached his home, but they forwarded it to him, and&#xD;
he replied from Dresden. It only reached me yes-&#xD;
terday."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BYRNES' OF GLENGOULAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
Pulling out a pocket-book, Mr. De Courcy took a&#xD;
letter from it which he handed to Father Esmond.&#xD;
While the priest was occupied reading the letter his&#xD;
guest again stood before the " St. Peter ;" and as he&#xD;
went afresh over every lineament the words of the&#xD;
venerable Father seemed to burn into his soul.&#xD;
Father Esmond, having read the letter twice over&#xD;
with the greatest care, folded it and returned it with&#xD;
a sigh. " God help my poor people if the person&#xD;
your cousin speaks of be the same Biggs; and I fear&#xD;
it is, for the points of resemblance are very strong.&#xD;
I fear there are sad times in store for the tenantry.&#xD;
Oh, Mr. De Courcy, my dear. friend, let me im-&#xD;
plore you not to abandon my poor people. You are&#xD;
theli only earthly salvation. Should you resign he&#xD;
would easily find a creature of his own to appoint&#xD;
who would be ready for any mean employment."&#xD;
"God forgive me! I'd rather have the wickedest&#xD;
old sinner than one of those canting, psalm-singing&#xD;
crew. The sinner might be converted ; but those&#xD;
creatures are so full of self-glorification that they have&#xD;
no room for the glory of God, and if they don't begin&#xD;
they certainly end with hypocrisy."&#xD;
"You may rest assured, Father Esmond, it will be&#xD;
the last resort left to honor when I resign the Glen-&#xD;
goulah estate. I need hardly tell you that it is not&#xD;

&#xD;
for its pecuniary profits I will hold it under such a&#xD;
man. I don't need it, happily; but my affections have&#xD;
become bound up with the tenantry. I am not a&#xD;
very demonstrative character, and I'm sure many of&#xD;
the poor fellows have thought me exacting, but I love&#xD;
them as though they were my own children.. I have&#xD;
ever found them punctual and upright in all their&#xD;
dealings with me, and ready to adopt any suggestion I&#xD;
made for the improvement of their farms; indeed, I&#xD;
think they took an especial pride in following my ad-&#xD;
vice, just to shpw their confidence in me; for some of&#xD;
them, I know, could not see the drift of my arrange-&#xD;
ments in the beginning, though they saw the benefit&#xD;
of them afterwards. It will be one of the most pain-&#xD;
ful epochs of' my life if I am ever compelled to resign&#xD;
the management of this estate, and I hope fervently&#xD;
I may be spared it."&#xD;
Poor Father Esmond was quite overcome by these&#xD;
observations, and, making a great effort to control&#xD;
his feelings, he said: "My dear friend, there is not a&#xD;
man, woman, or child in Glengonlah but would die&#xD;
for you. You must not leave us. God is stronger&#xD;
than the enemy ; we will all importune Heaven, and&#xD;
"Oh, Father Esmond, no; please do not let the ten-&#xD;
antry know I heard anything of the landlord - it&#xD;
&#xD;
would be extremely imprudent. In the first place,&#xD;
we have only a suspicion-a very strong one, it is&#xD;
true, but still a mere suspicion-that he and this Ox-&#xD;
ford man are the same person; and then, if the peo-&#xD;
ple through my means become prejudiced against him&#xD;
it would be sure to reach his ears, and we might look&#xD;
out for separation truly ; and, moreover, we would de-&#xD;
serve it too. No, no; I brought this letter to put you&#xD;
on your guard, as you might see some way of foiling&#xD;
him if he should contemplate a crusade against the&#xD;
religion of the people. This is in strict confidence."&#xD;
"Pardon me, my dear iM r. De Courcy ; I was&#xD;
quite taken off my guard by the bare idea of losing&#xD;
you. Of course you are perfectly right ; I see the in-&#xD;
propriety of letting any one know. You may rest&#xD;
easy: the contents of that letter shall never pass my&#xD;
lips until you release me yourself from silence."&#xD;
"Enough, Father; I must go now. It is getting&#xD;
T-ate."&#xD;
"Upon my word, you sha'n't leave me until you&#xD;
take pot luck with me; my dinner will be ready an&#xD;
hour from this, and Father O'Tool will be home and&#xD;
will amuse you with his droll stories. He's the life&#xD;
and soul of Tinmnanogue."&#xD;
. I am very much obliged, Father Esmond ; but it&#xD;
is quite impossible I could accept of your kind invi&#xD;

tation to-day. There are two gentlemen to dine with&#xD;
me--tourists; who came to see the vale of Ovoca. I&#xD;
met them this morning accidentally, and they prom-&#xD;
;sed to be at my house at six o'clock."&#xD;
"Well! well! I am very sorry for my sake; but the&#xD;
duties of hospitality can't be postponed, so I give you&#xD;
up for this day-but you mustn't take the curse of&#xD;
the house with you.&#xD;
"Mrs. Malone, will you be kind enough to bring&#xD;
the decanters here; and where's that cake I heard&#xD;
you boasting about? I think you said it went very&#xD;
nicely with raspberry jam ! We'll put it to the test&#xD;
ma'am, if you please."&#xD;
Mrs. Malone, who had been expecting some such&#xD;
summons, came in arrayed in a black-satin gown&#xD;
which had seen better days, and a cap decorated&#xD;
with blue gauze ribbons. She bore a tray, with a&#xD;
goodly array of wine-glasses, decanters, cake, and pre-&#xD;
serves, with her best china plates, and cane near&#xD;
demolishing a glass in her efforts to place the tray&#xD;
on the table and make a most gracious courtesy at&#xD;
the same time for Mr. De Courcy's especial benefit.&#xD;
With the kindness of a true gentleman he saluted&#xD;
the good woman, told her he had heard of her high&#xD;
reputation in the manufacture of cakes and pre-&#xD;
serves, and was resolved to show how much he ap-&#xD;
&#xD;
preciated such useful acquirements. Mrs. Malone&#xD;
assured his honor it was only his kindness to say so,&#xD;
not but she could make cakes if she only had the&#xD;
least idea that they would be tasted by so capable a&#xD;
judge, but that one now on the tray was only a poor&#xD;
specimen of her art, etc., etc. It was easy to see,&#xD;
however, that she was mightily pleased, and mak-&#xD;
ing two more dignified courtesies-one at the table,&#xD;
and one at the door-she made her exit, ever after-&#xD;
wards declaring that "Mr. De Courcy was the nicest&#xD;
and most knowledgeable gentleman that ever came&#xD;
to Tinmanogue."&#xD;
To say truth, the refreshments were all the best;&#xD;
and the agent, having partaken of them, requested&#xD;
Father Esmond to try and get over to his house&#xD;
soon. Mrs. De Courcy would be quite delighted to&#xD;
see him, and he wanted to show him some new ma-&#xD;
chinery he had got in the mill.&#xD;
"Ali, my dear friend ! it is little visiting I can do&#xD;
now. I suffer much at times from asthma, but&#xD;
praises be to. God! I have had a long life of good&#xD;
health, and must expect some shadow of the coming&#xD;
event which can't be far distant now."&#xD;
"Oh, you mustn't say that, Father; I trust it is&#xD;
iany, many years distant."&#xD;
" Well! well! God's holy will be done as He&#xD;

Mr. De Courcy leaned over and in an undertone&#xD;
whispered, "Meantime, Father, please remember me&#xD;
in your petitions to Heaven,, and when you are&#xD;
viewing your St. Peter."&#xD;
"Indeed, then, I will, my .dear friend and child.&#xD;
God bless you!"&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy vaulted into his saddle, and, rais-&#xD;

out of sight in a minute.&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE long-expected time came at length when&#xD;
there arrived at Glengoulah Castle troops of servants&#xD;
and piles of luggage from England; and, about a&#xD;
week afterwards, the Rev. Samuel Wilson Biggs,&#xD;
his lady the Rev. Mrs. Samuel Biggs, his two maid-&#xD;
en sisters the Misses Biggs, a valet, and two waiting&#xD;
maids, drove up in two carriages and four to the&#xD;
grand sweep before the castle hall; whereupon&#xD;
there was great commotion amongst the hired retain-&#xD;
ers, and a great clattering of dishes in the culinary&#xD;
apartments, accompanied by an odor bearing sure&#xD;
evidence that the comforts of the inward man were&#xD;
being attended to.&#xD;
A few days after the arrival of the family the two&#xD;
waiting women took counsel together, during break-&#xD;
fast hour, in the dressing-room of the Rev. mis-&#xD;
tress.&#xD;
"La me !" said Miss Jemima Jenkins (the Rev,&#xD;
mistress's own maid). to Miss Amelia Hopkins, who&#xD;
had the felicity to wait on the spinster sisters of their&#xD;
Rev. master-" La me! I verily believe we shall&#xD;

mope to death in this hold castle, perched hon the&#xD;
top of the 'ill; just look out of this winder, and see&#xD;
what a frightful 'ight we are." And the two young&#xD;
ladies gazed into the valley below, just at the point&#xD;
"where the bright waters meet."  Then they cast&#xD;
their eyes on the opposite hills, covered with verd-&#xD;
ure, though it was the first week of December, and&#xD;
on the thousand waterfalls and silver streams-one&#xD;
of the most picturesquely beautiful scenes the eye of&#xD;
man could wish to repose on in this world. Draw-&#xD;
ing    her head, Miss Jemima Jenkins exclaimed,&#xD;
with a sigh: "I shall ask mistress to raise my wages.&#xD;
It is evident there is no chance of society in such&#xD;
a wild place! I should die, I know I should, in one&#xD;
quarter."&#xD;
"Yes," rejoined Miss Amelia Hopkins; "and only&#xD;
think ! the coachman, footman, and two grooms are&#xD;
all married men; it is perfectly unbearable! I too&#xD;
shall demand 'igher wages, or I sha'n't wait on Miss&#xD;
Biggs, nor Miss Rachel neither, so I sha'n't."&#xD;
"And I heard mistress tell master this morning,"&#xD;
said Miss Jemima Jenkins, "that she didn't see how&#xD;
she was ever a goin' to live among sucli barbarous&#xD;
people. But la! master is so religious ! he told her&#xD;
she must look upon it as a trial sent her by the Lord,&#xD;
and try to bear it with Christian fortitude. He said:&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BYRNES OF GLENGOULAH.        . o&#xD;
Mistress, and Miss Biggs, and Miss Rachel, and you,&#xD;

I had come hair to such a rich hestate I should pre-&#xD;
fer to pay hagents to manage it for me, and live in a&#xD;

a saint on hearth master's one. He turned up the&#xD;
wites of his eyes, and says he, in a solemn voice,&#xD;
' What you say, my dear Jenkins, would be quite&#xD;
acceptable to a worldly-minded man, but my bowels&#xD;
yearn with compassion for those 'creatures who&#xD;
are half savages by nature, and whose steps run&#xD;
after iniquity; it will be my care to regenerate theni&#xD;
in a new baptism, so to speak, and bring their feet&#xD;
into the path of the Lord.' Oh, 'Opkins, you never&#xD;
'eard such sighs as he drew up from the very bottom&#xD;
of his stomach ; it gave me the 'art burn to 'ear 'em."&#xD;

can; and I'm a goin' to see if I can't make some&#xD;

companion. "La me !" cried Miss Jemima, with a&#xD;
contemptuous toss of her head, which made all the&#xD;
pink ribbons in her fancy cap flutter for five seconds,&#xD;

"I think mistress's own maid may look 'igher. I&#xD;
haint got such low tastes, I can assure you, 'Opkins;&#xD;
and if I do amuse myself a talkin' to Mr. Thompson,&#xD;
master's valet, it is only till I can find society&#xD;
capable of appreciating me."&#xD;
" Well done, my lady Pimlico," cried Miss Ame-&#xD;

" Well, Inever ! So we're puttin' on hairs, are we?&#xD;

our eyes and sing psalms" -and the tantalizing&#xD;
young lady began to sing in a nasal tone:&#xD;
"Oh! there's a 'appy land, far, far away."&#xD;
Suddenly the bell of Miss Biggs's dressing-room&#xD;
rang furiously, and at the same moment the sickly&#xD;
step of the Rev. mistress was heard ascending the&#xD;
stairs, which caused the instantaneous cessation of&#xD;
the hymn, and the sudden transition of Miss Amne-&#xD;
lia Hopkins from the front to the rear of the castle,&#xD;
while the offended person of Miss. Jeniina Jenkins&#xD;
quickly passed from an easy, dignified position in an&#xD;
arm-chair before the looking-glass, to one of most&#xD;
bustling activity, with something in her fair hand&#xD;
which bore a suspicious resemblance to a dusting&#xD;
brush. For the present we shall leave the afflicted&#xD;
&#xD;

about.&#xD;
Toney Byrne took his lease to Mr. De Courcy's&#xD;
office, at the mills, as directed, and was told to leave&#xD;
it there, for the Rev. landlord had not yet attended&#xD;
to any business; but Mr. De Courcy would be sure&#xD;
to call his earliest attention to it, and to some others&#xD;
which also required renewal.&#xD;
Some weeks had elapsed, Christmas had come and&#xD;
gone, the new year had dawned, but Toney re-&#xD;
ceived no summons to visit the office in order to sign&#xD;
his new lease. Atlength, in the second week of&#xD;
January, at the oft-repeated request of his wife, To-&#xD;
iey went to the office once more. He was received&#xD;
as kindly as ever by Mr. De Courcy, who told him&#xD;
he regretted very much that his lease was still un-&#xD;
signed by the landlord. "I have urged him fre-&#xD;
quently, Byrne, and he kept putting me off upon&#xD;
one pretext or another until last week, when he pos-&#xD;
itively refused to sign any lease until he made him-&#xD;
self acquainted with the character and condition of&#xD;
the tenantry. However,. it wont be long now until&#xD;
tIe March gales come, and perhaps he may give or&#xD;

I am quite willing to have the character of each ten.&#xD;
ant and the condition of each holding scrutinized,&#xD;
for I am proud of the whole."&#xD;
"Yes, sir, thanks be to God, your honor needn't&#xD;
be afraid or ashamed of any of us."&#xD;
" Mr. Biggs is going to have a new church built on&#xD;
the demesne, and a school-house, he tells me, so that&#xD;
will give a good deal of employment."&#xD;
" Ah, what in the world does lie want with anoth-&#xD;
er church, sir?- Sure the parish church of Tinman.&#xD;
ogue has only a congregation of seven persons, and&#xD;
where will he find scholars for his schools ?"&#xD;
"Why, you forget, Byrne. that his own establish.&#xD;
ent at the castle would make a numerous congme=&#xD;
gation; and, as they are all English, I presume they&#xD;
are Protestants likewise. Perhaps, too, many of&#xD;
them are married, and have young families; and if&#xD;
so, the ladies will require some useful occupation, and&#xD;
so may turn teachers.   And, perhaps"-Mr. De&#xD;
Courcy smiled quietly-"some of the tenantry may&#xD;
be glad to avail themselves of so good an opportuni.&#xD;
ty to educate their children, and send them to this&#xD;
school too."&#xD;
" Oh no, bedad, sir ! Sorra a fear of that. If&#xD;
the good gentleman is goin' to build churches, or&#xD;
schools aitber, for the benefit of the Glengoulah po'&#xD;
&#xD;
ple, ie had better keep his money. A good mornin'&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy !"&#xD;
"Good morning, Byrne."&#xD;
As Toney was approaching his home he met&#xD;
Tom Moody, whom he invited in to "take the weight&#xD;
off his limbs, and have a draw of the pipe." He&#xD;
told Mrs. Byrne "a power of news" about the Biggs&#xD;
family, and their doings at the castle. Indeed,&#xD;
Kitty had been dying to see the same.Tom, and had&#xD;
come out upon. the road a dozen times when she&#xD;
espied a hat like his coming down the road. With&#xD;
a long stocking tucked under her arm, at the toe of&#xD;
which she was busy with her needles, Mrs. Byrne&#xD;
would come out and look down the road in the op-&#xD;
posite direction from where the owner of the hat&#xD;
was coming, as if expectin somebody. After gazing&#xD;
a while she would turn round carelessly, intending,&#xD;
if it should be Tom, to say, "Why, then, now, is that&#xD;
yourself, Tom Moody? Who'd ever think to see&#xD;
you here the.iornin'?  Come in and rest a while."&#xD;
And so she would be sure to hear all the news, for&#xD;
Toni was an jucorrigible gossip, and had a knack&#xD;
of worming himself in with strangers, and by find-&#xD;
ing out a little here, and a little there, and " putting&#xD;
that and that together,". as lie said himself, it was&#xD;
quite wonderful what shrewd guesses he made.&#xD;

Poor Mrs. Byrne, however, had come out so often,&#xD;
and looked down the road so intently, and turned&#xD;
round so innocently (expecting to accost Tom) every&#xD;
time encountering the eyes of a stranger, that she&#xD;
almost despaired of ever seeing Tom Moody again.&#xD;
She had kept her own counsel, however, and never&#xD;
mentioned her movements to any one, fur she knew&#xD;
how much Toney discountenanced gossiping. As&#xD;
Tom now made his appearance with her husband&#xD;
she accosted him kindly, but with the most diplo-&#xD;
matic nonchalance, inquired after all the neighbors&#xD;
in his parts (Tom was a bachelor), and glancing&#xD;
carelessly at his hat, which he held between his&#xD;
knees, she requested to be allowed to put it on the&#xD;
table. As she laid it down she took a second look&#xD;
at it, and said, " Why, then, Tom Moody, did you&#xD;
pass down this road three or four times this week? "&#xD;
No, indeed, ma'am; .if I did you may be sure I'd&#xD;
ste) in to bid you the time of day."&#xD;
"'Deed, that's what made me wonder; and yet I&#xD;
certainly seen a hat like this one goin' down the&#xD;
road, whoever wore it."&#xD;
"You did, Mrs. Byrne ? ar0 you sure of that,&#xD;
ma'am ? "&#xD;
"'Deed, I never was surer of anything; when 1&#xD;
seen your hat now it brought it to my mind."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ahem ! I see now how the cat jumps; what&#xD;
kind of a lookin' man was he, Mrs. Byrne ? "&#xD;
Kitty, unwilling to confess she was outside of her&#xD;
own premises, said, evasively, " I just seen the hat&#xD;
over the hedge, and not beiii' a common one it took&#xD;
my eye."&#xD;
"Well, ma'am, that must be no other man but&#xD;
Sandy MeGlauren, the Scotch steward ; lie has a hat&#xD;
for all the world the comrade of mine; but he's a&#xD;
gradle taller nor I am, and has great big bones.&#xD;
Well, naa'am, if there's a head goin', divil alive it's&#xD;
the same Sandy; lie's as deep as a draw-well. And&#xD;
so he was up through the farms ! Bedad, I don't like&#xD;
the look of that, Mr. Byrne," turning to Toney. " I&#xD;
don't like to see such cattle rovin' through the hills,&#xD;
so I don't. 1 wouldn't say now but he was calculat-&#xD;
in' the value of every farm, and that a rise in the&#xD;
rent would be soon recommended."&#xD;
" Tnt, tut, man !" exclaimed Toney, who was&#xD;
always disposed to see the bright and peaceful side&#xD;
of everything-" Tut, tut! Don't you know he's a&#xD;
stranger, and it's only natural he'd like to see the&#xD;
country he has come to live in, and to examine the&#xD;
quality of the land too, and see if it's like his own?&#xD;
I don't see anything in that but what we'd do our-&#xD;
selves, if we were in his place "&#xD;

"Well, wait till you see, Mr. Byrne. I just can&#xD;
tell what them lads is thinkin' of. There's not a&#xD;

with both eyes,. to show his great cleverness.&#xD;
"'Deed, honest man, it's you I belave," chimed&#xD;
in the good woman; "but sure this man of mine&#xD;
won't give ear to anything he hears.. I do be as&#xD;
mad as a March hare with him sometimes. The&#xD;
childer can put their finger in his eye and he can't&#xD;

" Well, now, Kitty, where's the use of judging&#xD;
any one till you know they're guilty-it isn't fair-&#xD;
and we wouldn't like it to be done to ourselves. I&#xD;
like to judge every one fair and square until I find&#xD;

-God keep us all from harm."&#xD;
" Oh ! amen, Tom, honey!" said poor Mrs. Byrne,&#xD;
fervently; and then she began to question him on&#xD;
all he knew of the Biggs family.&#xD;
"And what kind of a lookin' man is the minis&#xD;
ter?"&#xD;
"A mighty mane lookin' little man, Mrs. Byrne,&#xD;
as ever you seen. How old is your Andy now&#xD;
&#xD;
" Ie's just risin' fourteen."&#xD;
"Well, the sorra taste bigger nor Andy he is&#xD;
-God bless the boy; but he's most as black as your&#xD;

for all the world what he looks like, and sorra word&#xD;
of lie I'm tellin'-he looks like a chimley sweep that&#xD;
was after givin' his face a kind of wash, what we call&#xD;
'a lick and a promise,'-now that's the very color&#xD;
of his skin ; and he has the schaminist eye you ever&#xD;
looked at, and wid all a mighty down mane look."&#xD;
" Oh, then the curse of the crows on him! Where&#xD;
was he comia' at all at all among dacent people ?&#xD;
Did you ever see the mistress at all?"&#xD;
"See her ? 'Deed, I'll engage I did; and more&#xD;

" Is she pretty itself ?"&#xD;
" Pretty ? Musha, Mrs. Byrne, where would such&#xD;

" Why the dickens go from her, sure ? We heard&#xD;

" So she is, ma'am ; a speretual lord's ; that is, a&#xD;

" No ; but she's the livin' picture of a yalla mnllott&#xD;
(mulatto); I inane in the color of her skin. I seen a -&#xD;
yalla mullott last summer when I was up in Dublin&#xD;
-I went on an errand from the master to the coun-&#xD;
sellor. Well, there was an American ship lyin' in the&#xD;

lott.  She was the steward's wife, I belave, and at-&#xD;
tended the ladies' cabin. her skinl looked like a bar&#xD;
of yalla soap that had the measles, but for all she&#xD;
was a fine soncy lookin' woman, and had the dar-&#xD;
lintist pair of eyes you could wish to see. Well, the&#xD;
minister's lady has such another skin; but, be my&#xD;
sowkins, she can't should a candle to the mullott in&#xD;
any other respect."&#xD;
"Is she a big woman ?&#xD;
"IHer height is fair enough, but the divil such a&#xD;
square made woman ever I seen; she's the very figure&#xD;
of a broomstick, and hasn't a bit on her bones. She&#xD;
has square dead-lookin' hair, and not as much of it&#xD;
on her whole head as Miss Whiny there -God&#xD;
bless the colleen -has in one of them locks that&#xD;
hangs over her laughin' eye. Her nose, chin and&#xD;
elbows is like raziers; and as for her jaw bone,&#xD;
it's so sharp that I'm sure if Samson had it he'd&#xD;
kill more Philistines wid it than he kilt wid the&#xD;

" Well, bad cess to you ! out of my sight, Tom&#xD;
Moody, that I mightn't sin, but my heart's broke&#xD;
laughin' at you ; but you're the fine lad, so you are:"&#xD;
"Upon my sowl I'm not tellin' you a word of lie,&#xD;
ma'am. Wait till you see her ; they say she's half&#xD;
the time dyin', and must have all kinds of attention&#xD;
from mornin' till night. She has a great high-flyer&#xD;
of a watin' maid leapin' round her all the time wid&#xD;
srnellin'-bottles and head-dresses. His two sisters is&#xD;
the very imott of himself-small, black, and mane&#xD;
lookin'-but they're all dressed so grand, my dear,&#xD;
and has such airs about them, and spake so fine&#xD;
you'd take them to be rale quality if you didn't&#xD;
know who they wor."  For all she laughed so heart-&#xD;
ily at Tom's description'of the minister's- family,&#xD;
poor Mrs. Byrne felt her heart sink at the prospect&#xD;
of having the future destiny of the Byrnes entrusted&#xD;
to such keeping. Day or night she could not rest,&#xD;
her duties became irksome, and she would sit for&#xD;
hours broodig over coming shadows, although her&#xD;
fingers were busy at the knitting. Soon she be-&#xD;
came fretful and impatient, and would fly off to Mrs.&#xD;

try to dive into the future intentions of thelandlord.&#xD;

was to visit Father Esmond at Tinimanogue, and&#xD;
have his reverence's opinion on the state of the case.&#xD;
Having once conceived the project she gave Toney&#xD;
no peace until he consented to go.&#xD;
" Now's the time, Toney, before the spring work&#xD;

CHAPTER VTI.&#xD;
"Two travellers might be seen wending their way "&#xD;
down the Cascade hill one cold morning at the be-&#xD;
ginning of February. The wind swept moaning&#xD;
through the ravines, and made a hollow murmuring&#xD;
through the leafless branches ; and between each&#xD;
gust a heavy drizzling rain was trying to fall, but&#xD;
was caught up by a stiff nor'easter before it reached&#xD;
the earth, and blown about in every direction.&#xD;
The travellers, one of whom was a woman, were&#xD;
on horseback-the woman seated a pililion behind&#xD;
her husband-both well clad, and with shawls tied&#xD;
over their hats. The horse, a sober philosophical sort&#xD;
of animal, jogged on perfectly unmindful of wind or&#xD;
rain. He held the bit in lis mouth, and, with hanging&#xD;
lip, and eyes fixed on the road before him, seemed to&#xD;
look with scornful defiance on the little gusts which&#xD;
jumped out at every winding of the road from be-&#xD;
hind rocks and stumps of trees, and battering his&#xD;
ears and nose, sent his mane flying into an erect po-&#xD;
sition, then retired to their hiding-places, and running&#xD;
along the hillsides were ready for him again at the&#xD;

next turning. Our four-footed friend, however, had&#xD;
evidently made up his mind not to be daunted by&#xD;
such insignificant obstacles as the weather could&#xD;
present, being perfectly conversant with all its pow.&#xD;
ers; and he accordingly jogged on in the same sgi -&#xD;
song trot which he had commenced on leaving home&#xD;
in the morning, and never varied his pace until&#xD;
pulled up by his rider at the residence of the parish&#xD;
priest of Tinmanogue.&#xD;
The cottage was no longer hidden amongst, the&#xD;
trees ; for the foliage had departed, and the bare&#xD;
vines hung dangling from the housetop, sometimes&#xD;
rapping on the panes as the wind blew them hither&#xD;
and thither, like vines in distressed circumstances&#xD;
which were beggihg for admission from the winter's&#xD;
storm. The scene, however, was not so muel&#xD;
changed as one would suppose from the season; the&#xD;
evergreens in front of the house still proudly bore&#xD;
their green banners, the mountain ash hung out&#xD;
myriads of scarlet berries, and the ever-verdant grass&#xD;
looked soft as velvet still, though the mountain&#xD;
breezes chased the lights and shadows in quick suc-&#xD;
cession over its surface. The only effect winter&#xD;
could produce was to cause the daisies and butter-&#xD;
cups to hide their heads in slumber, awaiting the&#xD;
breath of spring to reanimate them.&#xD;
&#xD;
Toney Byrne, alighting from his horse, assisted&#xD;
his wife to dismount. Fastening the bridle to one&#xD;
of the trees by the roadside, they entered the priest's&#xD;
garden, knocked at the hall-door, and, upon inquir-&#xD;
ing for Father Esmond, were shown mto the back&#xD;
parlor, which he seldom left now, as it was a warm&#xD;
room, and he was much afflicted with asthma. The&#xD;
venerable gentleman sat at a round table near the&#xD;
fire-place, attired as we last saw him, with the ad-&#xD;
dition of a cloak thrown over his shoulders. The&#xD;
old pleasant smile was there, indicating kindness and&#xD;
hospitality. His table was full of books and writ-&#xD;
ing materials, and in the centre of it stood a neatly-&#xD;
carved ivory crucifix on a pedestal of ebony, and at&#xD;
its foot lay his well-worn, breviary, He arose on&#xD;
Toney's entrance, welcomed him  and his wife to&#xD;
Tinmanogue, and having shaken them warmly by the&#xD;
hands, made them sit downin the ample chimney,&#xD;
where an immense turf-fire was blazing. having&#xD;
ascertained the mode by which they travelled, he sent&#xD;
his boy to put the horse in the stable and feed him.&#xD;
After inquiring for their family and the neigh-&#xD;
bors round, the priest asked after Margaret and her&#xD;
young husband, prophesying the future prosperity&#xD;
of so worthy and virtuous a couple. The father and&#xD;
mother were proud of the encomiums passed on&#xD;

Father honey, only what old Harry McLean toldus.&#xD;
You know Harry went off as a body servant to Sir&#xD;
Charles when he went to the college in England,&#xD;
and lie never left Sir Charles while he lived. He&#xD;
came back a few weeks ago and brought a power of&#xD;
news about the new landlord. I heard it all from&#xD;
Torn Moody, the under steward. Harry says Mr.&#xD;
Biggs's mother was a bar-maid in an inn in England.&#xD;
She was very pretty, and Sir Charles's uncle married&#xD;
her; lie was the uncle by the mother's side, and as&#xD;
none of the Plover family married, he became the&#xD;
heir. He says these Biggses is all as mane as dirt-&#xD;
savin' your reverence's favor-and that they're good&#xD;
for nothing but psalm singing; his wife is the daugh-&#xD;
ter of some Protestant bishop in England, and they&#xD;
think they're demeanin' themselves mightily to come&#xD;
to live in Ireland at all. They have no one around&#xD;
them but English-barring a head steward, a Scotch-&#xD;
man-and sure, your reverence, it's well I know if&#xD;
he's let to have his say in anything it's short Mr.&#xD;
De Courcy 'ill hold the agency, and the likes of him&#xD;
interfarin' between himself and the tenants."&#xD;
"Mrs. Byrne, my dear child ! don't be too ready&#xD;
to believe all you hear. Tiow can you vouch for&#xD;
the truth of what this Harry McLean says; he may&#xD;
have some dislike to Mr. Biggs's family. But now,&#xD;

suppose it all true, those things cannot affect you.&#xD;
Let him manage his household as he likes, that is&#xD;
nothing to the tenantry. As to the Scotchinan, it's&#xD;
most probable he is merely a head gardener to look&#xD;
after the demesne. You may be sure he won't have&#xD;
charge of the estate, so don't trouble yourself about&#xD;
it. If you take my advice-and I know you will-&#xD;
go on industriously as you have always done, mind&#xD;
no one's stories, and above all don't repeat them to&#xD;
your neighbors. iKeep your children to their lessons&#xD;
and their duties, and never fear. God is good, my&#xD;
dear friends, and we must never forget all He has&#xD;
done for us."&#xD;
" Och.! then, sure its true what your reverence&#xD;
says; glory, honor, and praise be to His holy name&#xD;
we have agreat deal to be thankful for, sure enough.&#xD;
And does your reverence really think there's no fear&#xD;
of us bein' put out ?"&#xD;
"Well, my child, I really see no earthly reason&#xD;
why you should be ejected.; you always paid your&#xD;
rent punctually, and such tenants as you are a trea-&#xD;
sure to any landlord with common sense. Now j ust&#xD;
put such thoughts from your mind and be cheerful&#xD;
at your work as usual. Remember, Kitty, we are al-&#xD;
ways in the hands of God, and He can do as He&#xD;
pleases with us. Walk ever in His presence, my child,&#xD;

and be resigned to His Ioly will. Don't believe the&#xD;
halt of what you hear, Kitty; just let it out at one&#xD;
ear as fast as it comes in at the other."&#xD;
The cheerful tones of the venerable Father's voice&#xD;
and his smiling face brought comfort to the heart of&#xD;
poor Mrs. Byrne.&#xD;
She raised her eyes to Heaven, then bowing het&#xD;
head, made the sign of the cross.on her forehead.&#xD;
" Why, then, that your reverence may live long&#xD;
and die happy! I knew I'd get comfort and conso-&#xD;
lation where I always found it; indeed, Father&#xD;
honey, you took a load from my heart the mnornin'."&#xD;
The priest then led them to talk of other matters&#xD;
-the farm, the stock, the crop, diseases of cattle, etc.;&#xD;
then he came to more domestic matters.&#xD;
" And so you tell me Andy is akin' great prog-&#xD;
ress at the figures?"&#xD;
"Yes indeed, your reverence; thanks be to God&#xD;
Mr. Tobin says he promises to be a fine scholar; he&#xD;
writes a mighty pretty hand, and so does Mike too,&#xD;
for his age, but Winny bates them all at the cy-&#xD;
pherin'. The master is mighty proud of her, she's&#xD;
so apt at the learnin'. And sure the decent man&#xD;
has the patience of Job with her; her eye is every-&#xD;
where to see-what mischief she can be at. Tli'other&#xD;
night she run the shank of the pipe into the fire till&#xD;
&#xD;
it was almost red hot, just at the time she knew the&#xD;
poor man would be turning' round to take a draw,&#xD;
and then she put it down mighty cute and slipped&#xD;
out. lie took it up by the head, not thinking' any-&#xD;
thing, and burned his mouth a little. Another time,&#xD;
she'll be mounted on the ditch with a white sheet&#xD;
about her, to frighten the poor man as he goes home.&#xD;
I do be goin' to kill her, but the father always has&#xD;
an excuse for her."&#xD;
Father Esmond laughed heartily at Winny's tricks,&#xD;
and told her mother not to be uneasy about her, for&#xD;
she would be a fine girl yet; that it was the lightness&#xD;
of her spirits made her so frolicsome.&#xD;
Toney and his wife arose to go home, but Father&#xD;
Esinond insisted on their sitting down again. He&#xD;
said they should not stir a step until they eat their&#xD;
dinner with him; that it would soon be ready. So in&#xD;
about half an hour a fine dish of roast chickens and&#xD;
an elegant cut of "belly bacon " reposing on a bunch&#xD;
of young greens, made their appearance on the di-&#xD;
nin g-room table, with.crisped potatoes jumping out&#xD;
of their skins, and a tankard of home-brewed ale.&#xD;
When the cloth was removed, a good glass&#xD;
of punch completed the entertainment. Father&#xD;
O'Toole was' in a distant part of the parish attend&#xD;
ing a sick call.&#xD;

After chatting awhile, in order, as they said, "not&#xD;
to be like the beggars that run off the minute they.&#xD;
get their bit," Toney brought round "the baste,"&#xD;
and, both mounting as before, took their departure&#xD;
for home, greatly refreshed both in mind and body.&#xD;
Father Esmond watched them from the window&#xD;
until a turning of the road hid them from his sight.&#xD;
"My poor simple children," said he, shaking his&#xD;
head sorrowfully, "God help you, and soften the&#xD;
hardships that are before you. No security for be-&#xD;
ing left in possession of the farm, made valuable by&#xD;
the toil and strength of many an honest man of&#xD;
your name! No hold on the home of many gene-&#xD;
rations but the honor of a Sassenach, and that man&#xD;
the Rev. Samuel Wilson Biggs, the most Papist-&#xD;
hating, smooth-faced hypocrite that ever landed on&#xD;
these shores, and that's saying a big word. God&#xD;
help poor Ireland, and the true children of the&#xD;
soil! Poor Kitty! your heart bodes evil, as well it&#xD;
may, from one of his cloth; but if you only heard&#xD;
all I did, and from such good authority. too, of his&#xD;
career in Oxford! My poor, honest, virtuous peo-&#xD;
ple! my heart bleeds for them all, but especially for&#xD;
poor Toney Byrne, the last of the once proud chief-&#xD;
tains of Wicklow, the O'Byrnes of Glengoulah!&#xD;
Oh, God help us ! God help us !"&#xD;
&#xD;
. Thus soliloquized Father Esmond, as with an in-&#xD;
patient step and an indignant frown he paced the,&#xD;
sitting-room up and down, his hands behind his-&#xD;
back.&#xD;
Suddenly stopping at the table he looked a mo-&#xD;
ment, then drawing over a little stool covered with&#xD;
black cloth, he knelt, and bowing his white head&#xD;
before the crucifix lie prayed from his heart out,&#xD;
for patience for himself and his faithful flock, the&#xD;
dwellers of those beautiful hills.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER VII.&#xD;
ONE fine dry morning in the early part of March,&#xD;
a plain but richly-finished carriage, of a deep shade&#xD;
of chocolate, with linings of crimson-satin, drawn by&#xD;
a noble pair of dark chestnut horses, was brought to&#xD;
a sudden stop at the office of Mr. De Courcy by a fat&#xD;
English coachman in clerical livery. The door was&#xD;
thrown open and the step let down in a twinkling&#xD;
by the liveried footman, and out stepped two gentle-&#xD;
men. One was a lean, gant-looking individual,&#xD;
with keen, sharp eyes, shaded by shaggy brows, high&#xD;
cheek-bones, and a quantity of sandy-colored frowsy&#xD;
hair. He was attired in a Highland shooting-dress,&#xD;
or something resembling it, and wore a drab felt hat&#xD;
turned up at the ears;, his hands and feet were large&#xD;
and clumsy, and his manner ungain ly. This inter-&#xD;
esting individual was Mr. Sandy McGlauren, the&#xD;
head steward of Glengoulah Castle. His companion&#xD;
was a man of low stature, and exceedingly sallow&#xD;
complexion. He had stealthy eyes, which feared to&#xD;
look you full in the face, excepting when worked&#xD;
upon by passion, and then they assumed an expres&#xD;
&#xD;
sion of fierce malignity ; the nose was pinched, and&#xD;
the mouth and chin of a mean receding character.&#xD;
The hai' was lank, black, and hung low on the fore-&#xD;
head. The dress was plain black, with the exception&#xD;
of the long-tailed white cravat worn by Anglican&#xD;
ministers, and commonly called " a white choker."&#xD;
1is whole appearance bespoke an air of mock hu-&#xD;
mility and sanctiinoniousness. He was in fact the&#xD;
very personification of the lowest English mechanic,&#xD;
such as we see so frequently amongst the Mormons&#xD;
who land at the American ports.&#xD;
This gentleman, it is needless to say, was the Rev-&#xD;
erend Samuel Wilson Biggs, the proprietor of Glen-&#xD;
goulah Castle, and .rector of the united parishes of&#xD;
Tininanogue, Slivedoon, and Kilorglan.&#xD;
Those three parishes were originally separate, and&#xD;
had each an especial rector; but as they were in the&#xD;
gift of the landlord of Glengoulah, the Reverend&#xD;
Samuel Biggs contrived to remove the incumbents,&#xD;
and very considerately bestowed the whole three&#xD;
upon himself, thereby fulfilling the scriptural adage&#xD;
that "charity should begin at home."  Besides this&#xD;
very wholesome reason for retaining the three par-&#xD;
ishes, the Reverend Samuel had two still more&#xD;
praiseworthy objects in view. First, he knew how&#xD;
very difficult, if not impossible, it would be to find&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7337-00000046"/>&#xD;
THE BYRNES. OF GLENGOULAH.      83&#xD;
&#xD;
another equally zealous as himself in propagating&#xD;
his gospel views-which were of course the only&#xD;
true views; and secondly, he felt the importance of&#xD;
the immense income which those parishes yielded in&#xD;
the form of tithes, in assisting his godl y ideas; thus&#xD;
making the mammon of iniquity subserve in spread-&#xD;
ing the knowledge of the Lord, amongst those be-&#xD;
nighted mountaineers. In the three parishes afore.&#xD;
said he placed curates at small salaries to do the sub.&#xD;
ordinate work of preaching, giving out service, and&#xD;
attending to the sick-if there were any such who&#xD;
required their presence,&#xD;
As these two worthies were alighting from the&#xD;
chocolate-colored chariot, a dusty head was stuck out&#xD;
of one of the windows above the office, and the voice&#xD;
belonging to it cried quickly: " Come here, Mick,&#xD;
and look at~ these quare lookin' customers. Who&#xD;
the D'houl are they at all ?" Mick thrust out a&#xD;
head with a paper cap, and a face all besmeared&#xD;
with flour: "-Oh, then, swate bad luck to the two&#xD;
of yiz. Yiz are the darlin' pair of turtle doves !"&#xD;
.And Mick, fixing his arms akimbo, gazed down ad.&#xD;
miringly with a comical leer-" That the divil may&#xD;
come jumpin' for the two of yiz; sure that's the&#xD;
ould Scotch haro from the castle, and his psaln-sing-&#xD;
ing master. Throth, I might aisey know 'twas no&#xD;
&#xD;
dacent bodies. Sure it isn't in their skins to look&#xD;
like Christians."&#xD;
The gentlemen were now shown into the private&#xD;
office by one of the clerks, and the dusty heads dis-&#xD;
appeared.&#xD;
Mr. De Courey came in a few minutes later, and&#xD;
they proceeded to business.&#xD;
After some conversation about the estate, Mr. Do&#xD;
Courcy produced Toney Byrne's lease, and those of&#xD;
sixteen other tenants, all drawn up in legal form,&#xD;
only awaiting the signature of the landlord.&#xD;
The Reverend Samuel refused to sign, stating as a&#xD;
reason that he considered Mr. MeGlauren an excel-&#xD;
lent judge of the value of land, and he had him go&#xD;
through the farms, examine them, and report upon&#xD;
his observations. His (Mr. MeGlauren's) opinion was&#xD;
that the farms were all rented at an absurdly low&#xD;
figure, and therefore he, the -Reverend Samuel, had&#xD;
resolved to raise the rents twenty-five per cent., and&#xD;
he wished Mr. De Courcy to signify as much to ine,&#xD;
tenantry next rentidav.&#xD;
A deep flush of indignation passed over the noble&#xD;
features of Mr. De Courcy, and his first impulse was&#xD;
to resign the agency on the spot, but he remembered&#xD;
his promise to Father Esmond, and by a great.effort&#xD;
of self-control mastered his anger. His emotion was&#xD;

&#xD;
keenly noted by the sharp eyes gleaming from under&#xD;
the heavy brows of the Scotch man. With a low&#xD;
chuckling laugh, and a shake of his carrotty head, he&#xD;
said : "The Munusther maun be reicht, sir; he maun&#xD;
be reicht" (right). The crimson, but of a paler&#xD;
shade, again for a moment flushed the brow of Mr.&#xD;
De Courcy. Disdaining however to notice the scoun-&#xD;
drel, he turned to Mr. Biggs, and represented to&#xD;
him the impolicy of commencing his career in anew&#xD;
country by an act which could not fail to. render his&#xD;
name unpopular, not alone with his own tenantry,&#xD;
but throughout the land; reminded him how he&#xD;
came there a stranger, and knew nothing of the&#xD;
wants or feelings of the people; told him how his&#xD;
(Mr. De Courcy's) father had been agent for thirty-&#xD;
five years to that estate, and he himself was close&#xD;
upon twenty-five years, so that it might be supposed&#xD;
he had the best knowledge of the property; and he&#xD;
assured him, if' the land had become more valuable,&#xD;
it was because of the untiring industry of the occu-&#xD;
piers, who had literally enriched it by the sweat of&#xD;
their brows; that it would be a poor reward for the&#xD;
toil of years to make them pay for their own in-&#xD;
provernents, and a very poor incentive to others to&#xD;
labor in the same cause.&#xD;
The Reverend Samuel during this discourse sat&#xD;
&#xD;
with head on one side, eyes half closed, and hands&#xD;
meekly folded on his breast, like one who had made&#xD;
up his mind tb bear all contradictions and trials for&#xD;
the sake of spreading the gospel, for which never-&#xD;
to-be-sufficiently-applauded object he wanted all the&#xD;
money he could scrape together, it mattered not&#xD;
whether injustice, oppression of the poor, ruin of fam-&#xD;
ilies, or any of those little minor circumstances stood&#xD;
in the way-the one grand end had to be accom-&#xD;
plished. Therefore, smiling benignly, and casting his&#xD;
eyes up to the ceiling, he said, with an approved nasal&#xD;
pronunciation: "My good friend, I am but a steward&#xD;
in the vineyard over which the Lord hath appointed&#xD;
me. I must do His work; besides, you will please&#xD;
to bear in mind that I do nothing illegal. I do but&#xD;
assert my rights. If those people of whom you&#xD;
speak consider. the rent I demand exorbitant, they&#xD;
can give up their farms, and I can find occupiers&#xD;
for them immediately-those, too, who are of the&#xD;
household of the Lord."&#xD;
"You will pardon me, reverend sir, if I remind&#xD;
you thit property has its duties as well as its rights.&#xD;
Let us try to disguise the fact as we may, those poor.&#xD;
people are, like ourselves, made from the slime of&#xD;
the earth, and have their human feelings, and hunan&#xD;
passions too. There is a rule, I believe, which ex-&#xD;

&#xD;
horts us to do unto others as we would be done by.&#xD;
A dark, malignant scowl took possession of the&#xD;
godly features of the Reverend Samuel, and his lips&#xD;
became livid; but, quickly recovering himself, this&#xD;
consummate Pharisee arose from his seat, observing,&#xD;
"Just so, Mr. De Courcy; just so. You have hit&#xD;
upon my principle exactly. You will please notify&#xD;
the tenantry as I told you."&#xD;
" I must be very dull of comprehension," said Mr.&#xD;
De Courcy, smiling sarcastically,."but I confess I,&#xD;
cannot see its application in the present case."&#xD;
" Ah, my good friend ! " and the Reverend Sam.-&#xD;
uel laid his kid-gloved hand blandly on Mr. De&#xD;
Courcy's arm and rolled his eyes upwards, "there&#xD;
are many of the sweetest passages in the book of&#xD;
life, the mysterious meaning whereof is hidden from&#xD;
those who are not called. But be of good cheer and&#xD;
pray; the Lord may vouchsafe to enlighten you yet."&#xD;
"I must beg to call your attention, sir," said Mr.&#xD;
De Courcy, thoroughly disgusted, " to the ease of&#xD;
Anthony Byrne. You surely will not class him&#xD;
with the rest of the tenantry ? "&#xD;
"And why not, pray ?  Am I under any especial&#xD;
obligations to Mr. Anthony Byrne that I should&#xD;
make an exception in his favor?"&#xD;
'Well, I rather think you are, Mr. Biggs. Your&#xD;
&#xD;
ancestors owed the peaceful possession of these es-&#xD;
tates to the ancestors of Toney Byrne, and you per-&#xD;
sonally owe them your existence at the present hour."&#xD;
"I do not comprehend you, Mr. De Courcy."&#xD;
"Know then, sir, that the O'Byrnes of Glengou-&#xD;
lab, the direct ancestors of this man, were once the&#xD;
proudest and most powerful chieftains of Wicklow.&#xD;
They were deprived of their estates for no crime but&#xD;
fidelity to the faith of their fathers." The malig-&#xD;
nant scowl again, speedily succeeded by upturned&#xD;
eyes. " One of those chieftains was a gallant young&#xD;
man. He had just been married when a deed of at-&#xD;
tainder was sworn against him and his young wife,&#xD;
who was of the Talbot family. His manhood arose&#xD;
against such flagrant injustice, and assembling his&#xD;
tenantry he armed them and fortified the castle in&#xD;
which you now dwell. The roads were not in as&#xD;
good condition as at present, and let me tell you the&#xD;
British soldiery were badly handled at every foray&#xD;
they made upon Glengoulah. Months passed, and&#xD;
still O'Byrne was master of his castle; but the Lord&#xD;
Protector, stung to the quick at the oft-repeated -de-&#xD;
feats and losses of his men, had ordered a desperate&#xD;
attack to be made on the stronghold the following&#xD;
spring. Poor O'Byrne knew his fate was sealed.&#xD;
le resolved to sell his life dearly, and to die  ghting&#xD;

in the sacred cause of home and altar. An unfore,&#xD;
seen circumstance changed his determination. Du.&#xD;
ring the short cessation of hostilities pending the last&#xD;
attack upon the castle, and whilst O'Byrne and his&#xD;
enemies were both making grand preparations, his&#xD;
wife, the lady Emeline, went to visit a sick tenant&#xD;
who dwelt on the opposite hill. As it was in the&#xD;
morning she deemed no other attendant necessary&#xD;
but her maid. On the way they met two drunken&#xD;
English soldiers, who gagged them, carried them into&#xD;
the city of Dublin, and would have treated them in&#xD;
the most barbarous manner, but a sergeant named&#xD;
Plover just happened to enter the house where they&#xD;
brought the females for concealment. He immedi.&#xD;
ately recognized the lady Emeline as the wife of the&#xD;
chieftain of Glengoulah, whom he had met in many&#xD;
a stormy encounter, and whom he admired for his&#xD;
bravery. With the generosity of a true soldier, he&#xD;
resolved to save her honor at the risk of his life--&#xD;
for in those days it was very dangerous to interfere.&#xD;
between a soldier and his prey ; he therefore brought&#xD;
in drugged liquor and treated the miscreants, pre&#xD;
tending to applaud their conduct. Soon they slept&#xD;
soundly, and Sergeant Plover carried the lady Eme-&#xD;
line and her maid in safety to the castle. The&#xD;
chieftain, in a state of distraction, was with his retain-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BYRNES OF GLENGOULAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
ers scouring the hills in search of his beloved wife.&#xD;
They dispatched a trusty messenger to announce&#xD;
to him her safe arrival. On learning from her the&#xD;
noble conduct of Plover, O'Byrne was so filled with&#xD;
gratitude that he consented to surrender without&#xD;
further trouble to the Lord Protector, on condition&#xD;
that Plover was made proprietor of Glengoulah, and&#xD;
he himself permitted to retire to the Continent.&#xD;
The first part of the proposal was gladly acceded to&#xD;
by the Lord Protector, for that castle had cost him&#xD;
already enough of blood and treasure, and Plover&#xD;
was a favorite soldier, having many times distin-&#xD;
guished himself by his bravery. O'Byrne, however,&#xD;
would not be permitted to leave the country, but&#xD;
was allowed as a favor to become a tenant farmer&#xD;
on the estate of which he was the rightful lord.&#xD;
This was done to humble his proud spirit, and the&#xD;
gallant young chieftain submitted to his hard fate&#xD;
vith the fortitude of a noble Christian soldier.&#xD;
He tilled his farm with his own hands and the&#xD;
kind offices of his neighbors-once his old retainers,&#xD;
who would insist on helping him, even at the risk&#xD;
of proscription. He thus contrived to make a living&#xD;
for his family.&#xD;
"Mr. Plover after a while built him a comfortable&#xD;
house, and gave Him the farm at a nominal rent.&#xD;

He would have given it in fee simple, but the law for&#xD;
bade one of his faith to hold1 property. Mr. Plover&#xD;
in his will left strict injunctions to all his descend&#xD;
ants to respect forever the descendants of O'Byrne,&#xD;
and' never to harass or annoy them in any manner,&#xD;
particularly specifying how they were indebted&#xD;
to that family for their position in society. Thea&#xD;
son of this madl was made a baronet, and so&#xD;
the Plover family came to possess Glengoulah&#xD;
Castle.&#xD;
"With regard to your personal affair, Mr. Biggs,&#xD;
your father, the uncle by marriage of the late Sir&#xD;
Charles Plover, was taken a prisoner by the Inspr.&#xD;
genti in the rebellion of 1798. They had been tri-&#xD;
umphant in Wexford, and he had papers upon him&#xD;
which convicted him of being a spy for the govern-&#xD;
ment. He had but lately come from England on a&#xD;
visit to hisr brother-in-law.&#xD;
" He was tried by the-court martial of the Insur-&#xD;
gents and sentenced to be hanged at daylight next&#xD;
morning. Byrne, the father of the present Anthony,&#xD;
remembering the peril from which an English sol&#xD;
dier once rescued one of his ancestors, resolved to&#xD;
save his life. But though he was high in favor with&#xD;
the Insurgent chiefs, he begged Captain Biggs's life&#xD;
in vain; so at all risk he cut the fetters that bound&#xD;

&#xD;
him during the night, and put him in safety on the&#xD;
road to Glengoulah. It was after this occurrence&#xD;
that Captain Biggs married and you were born.&#xD;
The present representative of the once princely chief-&#xD;
tains of Glengoulah is now but a peasant farmer ; and&#xD;
a more simple-minded, honest man-a more improv-&#xD;
ing, industrious tenant, or a more humble, peacea-&#xD;
ble Christian, to my mind, does not live on any town-&#xD;
land in Ireland than Anthony Byrne. I have his&#xD;
lease here, and you surely will not refuse a request&#xD;
specified in the will of all the Plovers. It is but&#xD;
common justice to the man to whose ancestors, Mr.&#xD;
Biggs, you owe not alone your estates, but your very&#xD;
existence."&#xD;
The Reverend Samuel Biggs had reseated himself,&#xD;
and it would require the pencil of a Rubens to por-&#xD;
tray the various changes in his countenance whilst&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy related the history of the O'Byrnes.&#xD;
One time his cheeks and forehead would turn black&#xD;
as night, and his lips become a livid white with rage ;&#xD;
again he would steal a glance at him under his dark&#xD;
brows, and the ferocity of a tiger would gleam from&#xD;
his sinister eyes, but oftenest he kept those visual or-&#xD;
gans almost closed, and retained his old attitude of&#xD;
Pharisaical sanctity.&#xD;

once moved his cold, keen eyes from the face of Mr&#xD;
De Courcy.&#xD;
When that gentleman ceased, his fine open coun.&#xD;
tenance was lit up by the exciting subject on whieb&#xD;
he had been speaking.&#xD;
Taking the lease of Toney Byrne from the pile on&#xD;
the table before him, he pushed it with the writing&#xD;
tray towards Mr. Biggs, who, suddenly becoming&#xD;
animated, looked up in his face with a malignant&#xD;
sneer, saying -"My good friend, with all your&#xD;
high eulogisms on this O'Byrne family, it is' very&#xD;
apparent from your own showing that they were&#xD;
ever of a rebellions spirit, and disloyal to their&#xD;
lawful sovereign; for if they had been obedient&#xD;
subjects they would have conformed to the glori-&#xD;
ous Reformation, and thus retained their castle and&#xD;
estates. The loss of their wealth and social posi-&#xD;
tion was a just punishment upon them for their&#xD;
disaffection to the constituted authorities. I have&#xD;
no sympathy with rebellion, and shall ever dis-&#xD;
countenance it."&#xD;
"And suppose, sir," urged Mr. Deo Courcy again,&#xD;
"that obedience to the commands of one's sovereign&#xD;
became disobedience to the commands of God, how&#xD;
would you act in that case ?"&#xD;
The Reverend Samuel almost foamed with rage,&#xD;
&#xD;

while a sardonic fire gleamed from his cat-like eyes.&#xD;
Rising from his chair, he hissed out:&#xD;
"Sir, you mistake my character altogether. 1&#xD;
shall make it my business to find out the disloyal&#xD;
persons on my estate, and get rid of them by all&#xD;
means. I will never sign that lease; attend to your&#xD;
orders, sir."  Then compressing his livid lips, he&#xD;
stepped into his carriage, followed by the chuckling&#xD;
Sandy, and in a moment they were gone.&#xD;

FoR a few seconds after they left, Mr. De Courcy&#xD;
stood like one transfixed, looking at the door by&#xD;
which they wevnt out, and which the cautious Scotch-&#xD;
man had shut close after them ; the veins in his fore-&#xD;
head were swollen, and his eyes flashed wildly. Sud.&#xD;
denly stamping his boot impatiently on the floor,&#xD;
lie drew himself up to his full height, gave his&#xD;
breast a stroke, and exclaimed : "What is the matter&#xD;
with you, Charles De Courcy? Have you become a&#xD;
poltroon, that you, an Irish gentleman of unsullied&#xD;
honor, suffered that upstart English hound to order&#xD;
you ? Yes! order me like a hireling ?" Making&#xD;
a bound to the door, he touched the handle. It&#xD;
opened, and before him stood Father Esmond, bow-&#xD;
ing with uncovered head, his white hair flowing be.&#xD;
hind, and unable to articulate from his labored&#xD;
breathing.&#xD;
"Oh, my dear venerable friend," said Mr. De&#xD;
Courcy, grasping his hands, and bowing over them&#xD;
to hide his emotion. His passion was all gone now ;&#xD;
he was subdued as a child. Leading the old gentle-&#xD;
&#xD;
man to the fire he placed him in an easy-chair, roused&#xD;
up a bright blaze, and preparing some mulled wine&#xD;
made him swallow it, with all the tenderness of a&#xD;
son. When the good father was better, Mr. De&#xD;
Courcy said:&#xD;
"Assuredly it was Providence sent you to me to-&#xD;
day, and just at the right moment too."&#xD;
"Ah, I understand what you mean. I passed&#xD;
Jiggs and the Scotchimain as I drove round the&#xD;
avenue to the mills, and he looked black as mid-&#xD;
night. I thought immediately there was bad news&#xD;
for my poor flock." Glancing at the table, he said,&#xD;
eagerly, " Has he signed the leases ?"&#xD;
"Indeed he has not, Father Esmond ; lie refused&#xD;
to do so point blank."&#xD;
"But Toney Byrne's! He could not refuse to&#xD;
sign his? Tell me that he signed Toney's, and I will&#xD;
rest easy."&#xD;
"Would that I could do so, Father! There it is,&#xD;
apart from the yest, where I pushed it towards his&#xD;
chair, after making a final appeal towards his sense&#xD;
of justice-justice!'.he repeated, bitterly; "justice&#xD;
from a Pharisee-a vile, canting hypocrite ;" and he&#xD;
flushed to the temples. Arising, lie paced the room&#xD;
a few times, then sat down and related the whole sub-&#xD;
stance of his conversation with Biggs, assuring Fa-&#xD;

ther Esmond that but for the promise he Liadnade&#xD;
him, and his figure, which seemed continually to&#xD;
rise before him, he would have thrown up the agency,&#xD;
and flung him neck and heels out of the office.&#xD;
"I deed, Father Esmond, my temper was never&#xD;
so sorely tried in my life."&#xD;
" Well, God be praised! my dear son; God be&#xD;
praised! It affords me some consolation to think I&#xD;
was any way instrumental in preventing the destruce&#xD;
tion of my poor people, for if you gave them up&#xD;
they were lost altogether."&#xD;
"Father, I made you a promise, and I will adhere&#xD;
to it at every cost short of honor."&#xD;
"Twenty-five per cent. of an increase  Oh, my&#xD;
poor children ! My poor children ! That's what&#xD;
brought me here to-day. There was a report that&#xD;
the rents were about to be raised. Altogether, good-&#xD;
ness knows, they are paying enough; but I never&#xD;
dreamed of anything so monstrous. Twenty-five&#xD;
per cent., Mr. De Courcy ! Can any government call&#xD;
itself just which permits one class to hold such&#xD;
power over another ?"&#xD;
" My dear Father Esmond, I have always been&#xD;
conservative in my views, as you know; and as long&#xD;
as the lord of the soil acted with justice and human-&#xD;
ity to his tenantry, I deemed it best to take things&#xD;
&#xD;
as they were. But I now see the folly of leaving&#xD;
any class utterly dependent upon another. I could&#xD;
scarcely believe once that any one holding the posi-&#xD;
tion of a gentleman could prefer a few paltry pounds&#xD;
to the love and respect of those from whom he&#xD;
derives his income. I have no language strong&#xD;
enough to denounce the British Government if it&#xD;
permits such things to exist any longer. It is a&#xD;
plague spot on its legislation."&#xD;
"Plague spot ! Why, my dear sir, it is robbery of&#xD;
the most barefaced kind. We will suppose a very&#xD;
common case. Give a man a piece of ground, in&#xD;
some cases wild mountain land, which never yielded&#xD;
you any profit; let him toil on it from morn till&#xD;
night, and his sons after him, and their sons again-&#xD;
aye, and their daughters, too; and after generations&#xD;
have ploughed it, mantired it, watered it, weeded it,&#xD;
and watched over it with unceasing care and unre-&#xD;
mitting toil, you inherit it and come a stranger into&#xD;
the country. You say: 'That is a neat farm ; how&#xD;
much does that man pay?' 'So much.' 'Ridicu-&#xD;
lons! That farm  would bring' much more, and&#xD;
more I will have.' 'But the man in possession made&#xD;
it what it is.' 'What do I care? The law gives it&#xD;
to me, and I only claim my legal rights.' Sir, I&#xD;
respect the highwayman as a far more honorable&#xD;

member of society than that man, for he will can-&#xD;
didly tell you he came to rob you; there is no&#xD;
pretence about him. But what shall we say of the&#xD;
law that upholds the scoundrel; not only permits&#xD;
him to violate the first principles of justice, but&#xD;
supports him in the commission of two crimes which&#xD;
cry to Heaven for vengeance-oppression of the poor,&#xD;
and defrauding the laborer of his wages? Now I&#xD;
ask you, if you were not an eye-witness of the fact,&#xD;
could you believe that the boastful and self-styled&#xD;
liberty-loving British Government could perpetrate&#xD;
such enormities in the face of the world in the nine-&#xD;
teenth century?"&#xD;
The old gentleman was fairly out of breath.&#xD;
" Really, Father Esmond, it never occurred to me&#xD;
in that light before. It is indeed monstrous, and I&#xD;
shall make it my business to-have this case brought&#xD;
before Parliament. It is not rightly understood, I&#xD;
think, or those obnoxious laws would be repealed,&#xD;
and more just ones substituted."&#xD;
" Ia ! ha! ha ! Justice from the British Parlia-&#xD;
inent! My dear friend, can it be possible you put&#xD;
faith in such a fallacy? I am too old a bird to be&#xD;
caught with such chaff as English legislation. I've&#xD;
seen that tried too often, and always with the samo&#xD;
result. God give my poor people patience until He&#xD;

"Well, Father, I confess to having some faith still&#xD;
left in British shame, at least, if not in British jus-&#xD;

" Shame ! How long have honest men been trying&#xD;
to arouse their sense of shame to the scandal of&#xD;
making a Catholic people like the Irish support the&#xD;
Protestant Church Establishment, whose doctrines&#xD;
they utterly repudiate? Just think of'it: an impov-&#xD;
erished, overtaxed people supporting in gorgeous&#xD;
luxury an institution that does nothing for them,&#xD;
either in soul or body! Where is there either shame&#xD;
or justice in that-tell me ?"&#xD;
"Oh, I admit there is no excuse for that abomin-&#xD;
able tithe system ; but you know religious bigotry&#xD;
can transform the most sane man into a fanatic.&#xD;
But here is a subject altogether apart from such&#xD;
feelings-a simple subject of right between man&#xD;
and man. I really think the matter ,has not been&#xD;
sufficiently investigated and kept before the public;&#xD;
and I do believe if it were, even English legislation&#xD;
would have been shamed into doing justice."&#xD;

kept you here so long. Those exciting topics make&#xD;
me neglect good manners. Pray, lean on my arm,&#xD;
sir, and we will go up to the house. Mrs. De Courcy&#xD;
will be charmed to see you."&#xD;
And so, between chatting with his amiable host&#xD;
and hostess, walking through the gardens and hot.&#xD;
houses, viewing the mills and the new machinery,&#xD;
dining and listening delghtedly to Mrs. De Courey&#xD;
singing Moore's melodies, accompanying herself on&#xD;
the harp, it was near eight o'clock of a bright moon,&#xD;
light evening when Father Esmond arrived at his&#xD;
own door, to the great delight of Mrs. Malone, who&#xD;
was in a terrible state of excitement about his&#xD;
asthma, and who -immediately commenced scolding&#xD;
him, while she arranged his chair and footstool in&#xD;
the most comfortable manner, and piled the blazing&#xD;
turf. She then transferred herself to the kitchen&#xD;
to scold Pat Lally, his servant man, for " keeping&#xD;
his reverence out in the night air."&#xD;
We will leave herself and Pat jawing, and take&#xD;
a peep at the poor, benighted people of the town&#xD;
'where this good pastor resided, and see how they&#xD;
fared for education..&#xD;
A short distance from the priest's house, about half-&#xD;
way down the green, was a long, low building, con.&#xD;
taiming rows of benches against the walls on which&#xD;
&#xD;
hung some half-faded maps, boai-ds with simple spell.&#xD;
ing and reading-lessons for the junior classes, and a&#xD;
couple of black-boards. At the upper end of this&#xD;
apartment was a desk or rostrum to which three&#xD;
steps ascended. Over it on the wall hung a large&#xD;
ordinary colored engraving, in a narrow black frame,&#xD;
of the Crucifixion. On the desk was laid-the largest&#xD;
edition of Walker's Dictionary, bearing palpable evi-&#xD;
dence of having been well used, and a formidable&#xD;
looking cane with a brass ferrule and top. This cane&#xD;
was used with terrible effect on the sides of the desk&#xD;
for the purpose of striking terror by its noise, and&#xD;
was a constant companion of its owner on all occa-&#xD;
sions, save when it rained. In this desk was seated&#xD;
every day a little dumpy man much below the mid-&#xD;
dle size, while the broad shoulders and massive head&#xD;
might have belonged to a pair of legs three times&#xD;
the size of those that bore them. The upper part&#xD;
of the body was evidently intended for a six-footer,&#xD;
but nature in some stingy freak cut the legs short,&#xD;
and so they were forced to expand as best they&#xD;
might, to bear up the ponderous body. Accordingly&#xD;
they did expand broadwise, and a pair of calves like&#xD;
a Dutch Burgher's was the consequence. These calves&#xD;
were encased in spotless white hose with deep ribs,&#xD;
while the feet belonging to them were covered in&#xD;

well-shaped, highly-polished shoes, fastened by steel&#xD;
buckles. The remainder of the costume consisted&#xD;
of a snow-white shirt and cravat, a dark-blue body&#xD;
coat, with bright brass buttons, a pair of breeches of&#xD;
snuff colored cloth, fastened at the side of each knee&#xD;
by three small brass buttons, a vest of the same ma,-&#xD;
terial and buttons; a black beaver hat, rather of the&#xD;
Quaker shape, as the leaf was a good deal wider&#xD;
than those usually in vogue ; coiled up nicely in the&#xD;
crown of the hat was a clean blue muslin handker~&#xD;
chief with a white vine border; in the fob of the&#xD;
breeches reposed a huge silver watch, which kept&#xD;
time to the second, and pendant from it hung dang-&#xD;
ling a purple-watered watch ribbon, two inches wide,&#xD;
at the end of which was fastened a large gold seal&#xD;
and key. On a vet or vei'y cold day an overcoat of&#xD;
black freize was laid carefully across the shoulders,&#xD;
the sleeves hanging loose, and a large blue cotton&#xD;
umbrella replaced the cane.  This costume never&#xD;
varied once during the lifetime of any one who&#xD;
knew him.&#xD;
His features were large, strongly marked and'&#xD;
coarse ; the mouth, a little open, displayed a most in-&#xD;
dependent set of teeth, for each stood on its own&#xD;
merits, with a space between, and as they had no&#xD;
chance for bad companionship they remained un-&#xD;

tainted to the age of 85. The cheeks were bloorn&#xD;
ing as those of youth, and-the head covered with a&#xD;
profusion of coarse hair, which -was white as the&#xD;
mountain snow. Such was the personal appearance&#xD;
of Mr. Michael Rafferty, for more than forty years&#xD;
the teacher or "master" of Tinmanogue school.&#xD;
Like most of his class, he was a fine writer, a splen-&#xD;
did mathematician, and well versed in grammar,&#xD;
geography, and history, but, unlike many country&#xD;
masters, he knew nothing of the classics.&#xD;
In repose the face seemed harsh, for the brow was&#xD;
contracted, partly by thought and partly from the&#xD;
habit he had formed of trying to terrify refractory&#xD;
urchins; but when animated, oi- in conversation lie&#xD;
looked up, you noted the gentle expression of his&#xD;
mild blue eye, and your heart warmed to him.&#xD;
Meet him where you would, in the school-house or&#xD;
in the street, morning, noon, or. night, Sunday or&#xD;
week-day, he always looked as if he had just made&#xD;
iis toilet; his shirt and cravat were always clean,&#xD;
his clothes always brushed, his hat always unruffled,&#xD;
his stockings always spotless, and his shoes ever&#xD;
shining like a looking-glass. It mattered not how&#xD;
wet or sloppy the village streets were, lie could&#xD;
manage to navigate through them without a speck.&#xD;
It was a matter of astonishment to all the villagers&#xD;

how on earth he could ever pick his steps in the&#xD;
dark of a winter's morning going to the chapel, back&#xD;
to his lodgings, and then to the school-house, with-&#xD;
out speck or stain, excepting a very small fringe of&#xD;
1 ud to the soles of his shoes. Many a one followed&#xD;
him to learn the art, and gave it up in despair, de-&#xD;
claring it was a particular knack he had.&#xD;
And that little dumpy old bachelor (fr. Rafferty&#xD;
never married), with such an odd figure and coarse&#xD;
features, held one of the noblest and purest souls that&#xD;
ever dwelt in mortal coil. For over forty years he&#xD;
was known to all the inhabitants of Tinmanogue to&#xD;
be in the chapel every morning as the Angelus was&#xD;
chiming six o'clock. Assembling all the poor and&#xD;
whoever wished to join, he recited public morniisg&#xD;
prayer:, read a pious chapter, and then those whoee&#xD;
duties would not permit them to stay, went off, and&#xD;
those who could wait remained to hear mass.&#xD;
Amongst the latter was always our venerable friend.&#xD;
After mass he went to breakfast, and thence to&#xD;
school, where he led many a pupil, not alone in the&#xD;
walks of science, but in the more diffleult path of&#xD;
Christian perfection. At five o'clock every eve-&#xD;
ning he was again in the chapel reciting for a crowd&#xD;
of faithful souls the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin,&#xD;
and many a fervent Hail Mary went up for the con&#xD;

more than any other circumstance, that we wiii&#xD;
have much to suffer for our many imperfections-&#xD;
even the best of us-before we can enjoy the Beat-&#xD;
ific Vision. Ile was a little over 85 years of age&#xD;
when he left this world, and I heard those who&#xD;
knew him from his early years-venerable priests&#xD;
who had grown up with him-4declare his whole life&#xD;
to be one of most spotless sanctity; his exterior&#xD;
cleanliness, and the neatness with which he picked&#xD;
his steps through the mire, were a type in him (it is by&#xD;
no means always the case, however,) of that interior&#xD;
purity of soul which he possessed, and    which&#xD;
brought hita unstained through the mire of temnpta-&#xD;
tions. Yet, for five years before he quitted this life,&#xD;
he was never able to leave his bed. He lost the use&#xD;
of his limbs, and a most depressing languor fell&#xD;
upon his once stalwart form; but, lying there help-&#xD;
less as a child, the Christian soul rose above this&#xD;
world and its passing sorrows; of him it might be&#xD;
truly said, he lived on earth but not in it. Every&#xD;

time one of the priests would come to give him the&#xD;
Holy Sacrament he would beg with streaming eyes&#xD;
to be raised to a kneeling posture in the bed, that&#xD;
lie might more fittingly receive his Lord and Master&#xD;
as became a sinner.&#xD;
Light be the turf of holy Ireland on your breast,&#xD;
most dear and venerable friend ! I see your every&#xD;
feature before mue as distinctly to-day as when a&#xD;
child I sat upon your knee, when you puffed out&#xD;
your cheeks and laughed so joyously when I broke&#xD;
them in With my tiny fists. Many an hour I passed&#xD;
since then in most profitable converse beside that&#xD;
prison bed, yet a murmur never escaped his lips.&#xD;
Many forgot him, as will ever be the case in this&#xD;
world, and sometimes lie fared very poorly; but his&#xD;
love, his trust, his every hope, were placed where&#xD;
they ever bear fruit. His only regret was his inability&#xD;
to go to the chapel and be present at the Adorable&#xD;
Sacrifice. Many an effort he made of a beautiful&#xD;
Sunday in summer to arise and creep along by any&#xD;
means, and only gave up the attempt when he sank&#xD;
exhausted, and the good couple with whom he&#xD;
lodged carried him back to bed. For two nights&#xD;
beforelie died the most ravishing music filled that&#xD;
hutle dwelling. Some of the neighbors arose to&#xD;
look out, thinking it was a band returning with&#xD;

of the gentri;  strains filled the air.  Upon&#xD;
enteringhis room next morning (for he always slept&#xD;
undistur bed at night) his landlady, a good, pious&#xD;
woman,who deemed it an honor to wait upon him&#xD;
- l she might-found him conversing with&#xD;
unseen spir'ts, his face-radiant, she declared; and on&#xD;
calling to him he remained a good while perfectly&#xD;
uconscouS of her presence. Ile afterwards told-&#xD;
her the Blessed Mother and her holy spouse, St.&#xD;
Joseh, .had been to visit him, and were, coming&#xD;

Accordingly, next morning the neighbors were all&#xD;
assembled in his room when they heard hm  mur-&#xD;

possible I" and his exulting spirit took wing in that&#xD;
gloriouscomny.      ocan doubt that myriads of&#xD;
angelic spirits were there attending on the Queen of&#xD;

to celestial melody?$&#xD;
Such was the teacher from whom most of tho&#xD;
men and boys of Tinmanogue received their educa-&#xD;

a great respect for Mr. Rafferty, and felt well satis-&#xD;

master. Let us now see how the girls fared for in..&#xD;
struction. There had long been established in the&#xD;
neighboring town of Ardmore, a convent of the&#xD;
Presentation order, where the ladies devoted their&#xD;
lives to the education of the poor; and where, in&#xD;
addition to the usual English branches, they devoted&#xD;
their attention to straw-plaiting, lace-making, ein-&#xD;
broidery, and every kind of work, both useful and&#xD;
ornamental. Another convent, of the order of Our&#xD;
Lady of Mercy, had a fine academy for the education&#xD;
of the wealthy, where every accomplishment was&#xD;
taught. For those who could not come into town&#xD;
to school, two male and one female teacher went out&#xD;
giving lessons at the farm-houses through the hills.&#xD;
One of these teachQrs, Mr. Tobin, was, as I said&#xD;
elsewhere, engaged by Toney Byrne to visit his&#xD;
farm three times in the week and give, as he ex-&#xD;
pressed it himself, "a draught of his superfluous&#xD;
knowledge from the overflowing fountain of his brain&#xD;
to the young aspirants who thirsted to drink there&#xD;
from."  Mr. Tobin was a laige-boned man, who.&#xD;
walked with a shuffling gait, and always looked as if&#xD;
his bones were thrown together in a great hurry,&#xD;
being left to shift for themselves and get under the&#xD;
skin after their own fashion--and a remarkably&#xD;
funny fashion it was-for he seemed entirely dis-&#xD;
&#xD;
jointed at every step he took; .yet he managed to&#xD;
get over a considerable space of ground in as short a&#xD;
time as most men after all. His garb was what is&#xD;
usually called "shabby "genteel." His body-coat,&#xD;
vest and pantaloons were all black once, and still&#xD;
had some faint pretentious to that approved shade&#xD;
in gentlemen's wear; his shirt and cravat a dingy&#xD;
white; his hat, a tall thin "stove pipe " with a nar-&#xD;
row rim, contained three articles, a, brown cotton&#xD;
handkerchief, a small black-covered prayer-book,&#xD;
and a pair of beads, all of the greasiest description.&#xD;
His clothes looked as loosely hung as himself. His&#xD;
head was bald, and his features sharp, as was also&#xD;
his disposition, for all his remarks tended to the&#xD;
sarcastic. Yet, withal, he was a fine teacher and a&#xD;
magnificent penman. Parents deemed themselves&#xD;
fortunate who had engaged Mr. Tobin, and many of&#xD;
the gentry secured his services for their children ;&#xD;
but .though all respected him for his age and learn-&#xD;
ing, no one loved, him ; hence the little scruple&#xD;
young people had-your humble servant included-&#xD;
in playing practical jokes on the old man.&#xD;
The other teacher who shared the labors of Mr.&#xD;
Tobin in the visiting department, was a young man&#xD;
who had been a pupil of Mr. Michael Rafferty,&#xD;

er masters, and was in fact quite a dandy teacher&#xD;
He knitted his brows very hard and pursed out his&#xD;
lips very much to give himself an air of profound&#xD;
scholarship and determination; but for all his fine&#xD;
clothes and fine airs he lacked the real knowledge of&#xD;
the others, and was consequently little heeded. From&#xD;
this circumstance he was frequently heard to lament&#xD;
the decay of literary taste, and to declare it as "his&#xD;
positive conviction," and no one need try to persuade&#xD;
him to the contrary, "that if a second Byron arose&#xD;
he would not be appreciated in those degenerate&#xD;
days." Such, dear reader, was the state of educa-&#xD;
tion in the town lands of Ardmore, Glengoulah, and&#xD;
Tinmanogue when the Rev. Samuel Wilson Biggs,&#xD;
taking pity, in the benevolence of his charitable bo-&#xD;
som, on the benighted condition of his.seini-barbar-&#xD;
ons tenantry,idetermined to carry out a most philan-&#xD;
thropic idea which had long lain dormant in that&#xD;
very interesting portion of his clerical form-it was&#xD;
to build a school-house on his demesne, where his sis-&#xD;
ters could find the most gratifying occupation for&#xD;
their superabundant time, and also earn a well-&#xD;
deserved reputation for sanctity.&#xD;
The Rev. Samuel, being a man- of energy, or, as&#xD;
he would express it, "consumed with the zeal of the&#xD;
Lord," had no sooner matured his plans than he put&#xD;
&#xD;
them into execution ; bricklayers, carpenters, paipt-&#xD;
ers, and hod-carriers were briskly at work, and by&#xD;
the time the prinroses peeped under the hawthorn&#xD;
hedge, and hill and grove had resumed its foliage, an&#xD;
elegant school-house stood in all its grand propor-&#xD;
tions and all its comfortable appointments.&#xD;
It wanted but two requisites to make it perfect-&#xD;

pastors; for Alnighty God, pleased with their ardent&#xD;
faith and profound resignation, distilled into their&#xD;
hearts the dew of His Divine grace, and gave'them&#xD;
strength to bear up with fortitude against the many&#xD;
severe trials which were before them.&#xD;
After Mass the men all repaired, as was their cus-&#xD;
toml on that day, to the o-fice of Mr. De Courcy,&#xD;
where, as each paid his rent and got his receipt, that&#xD;
gentleman requested him to remain a few minutes,&#xD;
as he had something to say.&#xD;
When business was over and all had assembled,&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy assured them it was with the utmost&#xD;
reluctance he had to inform all those whose leases had&#xD;
expired, or were about to expire, that their present&#xD;
landlord, the Rev. Samuel Wilson Biggs, had come&#xD;
to the determination of raising their rents 25 per&#xD;
cent., or one-fourth more than they were now paying.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
THE rent-day came at last, for that is called in&#xD;
landlord parlance, "the spring gale." It was the&#xD;
25th of March, which every Christian knows is the&#xD;
feast of the Annunciation, and which all the Tin-&#xD;
manogue tenantry knew was a holiday of obligation,&#xD;
even if the bell from the now leafless branches of'&#xD;
the elm-tree had held its tongue that day-a crime&#xD;
which could not be laid to its charge, for its clear,&#xD;
sharp tones were carried by the March wind through&#xD;
every glen and ravine of the hills around.&#xD;
After Mass their venerable pastor read the gospel&#xD;
of the day, and took occasion from it to remark on&#xD;
the life of sorrow, poverty and suffering which&#xD;
their dear  ord had endured on this earth to paur-&#xD;
chase for them the joys of heaven. He reminded&#xD;
them how sufferings have ever been the portion of&#xD;
the elect, and if borne with that patience and resig.-&#xD;
nation of which their adorable Lord set them the&#xD;
example and united with His bitter passion, they&#xD;
would assuredly bring them all face to face with&#xD;
their Divine Redeemer, who would receive them inl&#xD;

&#xD;
A murmur of discontent ran through the crowd,&#xD;
fand maly were about to remonstrate and put in their&#xD;
special claims to consideration, but Mr. De Courcy,&#xD;
waving his hand for silence, all was still.&#xD;
He said, " My friends, you cannot possibly hear&#xD;
this news with more pain than it gives me to tell it;&#xD;
nor can you urge any claim or make any stronger&#xD;
remonstrance against it than I have already done in&#xD;
your name. As long as I hold the agency of this&#xD;
estate I am bound up in your interests, both by dut3t&#xD;
and inclination, and I know you will believe mC&#xD;
when I tell you that if the fortunes of my owir&#xD;
children hung upon my words I could not make a&#xD;
more touching appeal than that which I addressed&#xD;
to the landlord, in order to change his intentions;&#xD;
but I spoke in vain. His only reply was, that if any&#xD;
of you think his demand exorbitant, he is satisfied.&#xD;
to take the farms off your hands; and, indeed, he&#xD;
said he had persons already in view who were will-&#xD;
ing to pay the amount he requires. If any of you&#xD;
think you can be more successful than I was by a&#xD;
personal application, I would be very glad you would&#xD;
try it. Those who have no leases will now under-&#xD;
stand they will have to pay at the advanced rate&#xD;
next -September gale, and all the rest as the leases&#xD;
drop. Notices in a legal form will be sent round&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
to this effect. Mr. Biggs has further instructed me&#xD;
to say that lie will not sign any lease at present, even&#xD;
at the advanced rate."&#xD;
Voices now repeated "Long life to you, Mr. De&#xD;
Courcy."&#xD;
"We're entirely obleeged to you, sir, whatever&#xD;
way itturns."&#xD;
"Sure, well we know it's not your honor's fault,"&#xD;
etc., etc.&#xD;
A report had reached them some days before that&#xD;
there would be " a rise," but they never expected it&#xD;
to be so much; and above all they did not expect to&#xD;
be left without leases.&#xD;
One fine young man, apparently about twenty&#xD;
years of age, who had a blind father and a paralyzed&#xD;
grandmother to support, now approached Mr. De&#xD;
Courcy, who-concluding he was coming to ask&#xD;
about his lease-said, "He refused to sign your lease&#xD;
amongst the rest, Dempsey."&#xD;
"Oh, I suppose he did, sir; I did not expect any-&#xD;
thing else. But will youi'honor be played to tell me&#xD;
did he really refuse to give a lase to Toney Byrne ?"&#xD;
"He did, indeed."&#xD;
"And did lie rise" the rent on lim, sir ?"&#xD;
"lHe did."&#xD;
"Well, boys," turning to the other men, " we may&#xD;

hold our tongues after that ! Mr. De Courcy !-I&#xD;
beg your honor's pardon, for I know it's agin your&#xD;
grain to tell such news to us--but I can't help saying'&#xD;
that's the blackest piece of robbery ever was comm it-&#xD;

" Bedad, that's gospel, anyway."&#xD;
" Och ! sure we ought to be ashamed to spake of&#xD;
ourselves at all, so we ought."&#xD;
These sentences were uttered by several voices at&#xD;
the same time, while poor Toney stood like one&#xD;
transfixed. The news of the raise did not surprise&#xD;
him, for Tom Moody kept Kitty pretty well posted&#xD;
on all such reports as the wily Sandy McGlauren&#xD;
thought fit to put in circulation ; nor did Toney care&#xD;
much for that, for his rent was low, and now that&#xD;
lie had brought the land into the highest state of&#xD;
cultivation, he could afford it; but the refusal to sign&#xD;
his lease was a blow he never expected. He nev r&#xD;
spoke or stirred from the spot where he stood till&#xD;
Bryan Dempsey, grasping his hand, drew him into&#xD;
the avenue, where all his neighbors came flocking&#xD;
around him to sympathize with "one of the. would&#xD;
stock," forgetting their own sorrows in the greater&#xD;

&#xD;
one of the lawful heir of Glengoulah. Poor Toney&#xD;
went home to Kitty and the children with sad niews&#xD;
and a sad heart. For the first time in his life lie&#xD;
was utterly sunk and depressed. Always hopeful&#xD;
until now, he had accustomed himself to look at the&#xD;
bright side of everything, but lie had never known&#xD;
before what it was to be dependent upon the will of&#xD;
a landlord, and lie felt that the spirit of the EByrnes&#xD;
was broken at last. Still, Toney was a Christian,&#xD;
and high above his sorrows arose his resignation to&#xD;
the Divine will; therefore, though his heart was&#xD;
troubled and his head bowed, lie would say: "It's&#xD;
no fault of ours, so welkiin be the will of God."&#xD;
It was plain to Kitty that with all his resignation-&#xD;
the light was gone from his heart, and like a true&#xD;
woman she pretended to the greatest hope and cour-&#xD;
age.&#xD;
"Tut, tut, man,! Don't be a bit afeared. If we&#xD;
have no law itself, he won't put us out while we pay&#xD;
our rent regularly and manage the farm right. May-&#xD;

after us-the cross of Christ be about us, and the&#xD;
protection of His Blessed Mother! Amen ! " and&#xD;
Kitty crossed herself aid made an attempt at a gen-&#xD;
uflexion, which was a duck .down and a scrape of&#xD;
the left foot behind. When Toney was full of hope&#xD;
six months ago, before the landlord arrived, Kitty&#xD;
was in despair, and could see no gleam  of hope&#xD;
whatever; and now, in a sort of affectionate contra-&#xD;
diction, because Toney was depressed, her hopes&#xD;
arose. We have seen how she teased her husband&#xD;
night and day until they visited Father Esmond.&#xD;
She now proposed another visit to him for consola-&#xD;
tion, but Toney decidedly refused to trouble his rev-&#xD;
erence any more with his affairs. After time had a&#xD;
little blunted the first keen edge of his troubles he&#xD;
worked away cheerfully as ever to all appearance;&#xD;
and since his self-reliant spirit prevented him from&#xD;
intruding his sorrows on his pastor, that old pastor&#xD;
himself, accompanied by his curate, Father O'Tool,&#xD;
drove up in his gig to pay a visit of condolence to&#xD;
Toney and his family. Poor Father Esmond was&#xD;
sadly grieved for the position in which Toney was&#xD;
placed ; he told Mr. De Courcy, the day he visited&#xD;
the mills, that he was confident Toney Byrne would&#xD;
be treated with more harshness than any of the ten.&#xD;
antry by Biggs, just because he was the rightful&#xD;
r,&#xD;
&#xD;
owner of Glengoulah Castle. Like all vulgar np.&#xD;
starts, Biggs would hate the idea of coming in contact&#xD;
with a man whose appearance constantly reminded&#xD;
in that he himself was but an usurper. Mr. Do&#xD;
Courcy was of the same opinion.&#xD;
Now, however, Father Esinond spoke hopefully,&#xD;
and beggedTonev not to lose heart whatever he did.&#xD;
Father O'Tool told them so many l y d anec-&#xD;
dotes that they were in roars of laughter before half&#xD;
an hour passed. The very sight of this flue young&#xD;
priest-who was said to be a lineal descendant of&#xD;
the far-famed royal O'Tools of Glendalough--was&#xD;
enough to revive the most depressed.&#xD;
He was in appearance "every inch a- king."&#xD;
Twenty-eight years old, six feet three "without his&#xD;
boots," and made in proportion; his dark-brown hair&#xD;
fell in shining masses on a noble forehead of alabaster&#xD;
whiteness; his yes, dark-blue, were dancing yith&#xD;
boyish mirth; the nose was a model for a sculptor;&#xD;
the mouth, wreathed in smiles, disclosed rows of pear-&#xD;
ly teeth, while the cheeks and lips were tinged with&#xD;
the bloom of a happy heart; hiscarriage and whole&#xD;
appearance was- that of a. strikingly handsome,&#xD;
noble-looking man, and yet withal there was a&#xD;
simple expression of almost boyish fun and harm-&#xD;
less waggery. Wherever Father O'Tool went, there&#xD;

&#xD;
was sure to be a group of children around him,&#xD;
Some swung from his arms, others hung on his&#xD;
skirts, while his voice and joyous laughter were the&#xD;
loudest in the merry throng.&#xD;
With all his frolicsome ways, no one knew bet-&#xD;
ter how to uphold the dignity of his sacred calling,&#xD;
and on the altar, and in the confessional, there was&#xD;
no more zealous and impressive priest. Gathering&#xD;
Toney Byrne's youngsters around him  he soon won&#xD;
their confidence, and heard from Mike all the jokes&#xD;
Winnie played on Mr Tobin, the schoolnaster;&#xD;
and Father O'Tool told them in return all the&#xD;
pranks he used to play in his school days. After&#xD;
they had all laughed to their heart's content, lie&#xD;
questioned them  on their Catechism  and other&#xD;
studies, and exhorted them- to love and obey their&#xD;
parents. They were sober as judges in a moment,&#xD;
for every child in the parish knew Father O'Tool's&#xD;
habits well: lie would be as a child amongst good&#xD;
children, but he became stern as a lion with a sulky&#xD;
or disobedient child ; and thus, though they loved&#xD;
him dearly, they very much feared him too. And&#xD;
some children of a larger growth partook of- the&#xD;
same sentiments in his regard.&#xD;
Toney and his wife were highly delighted with&#xD;
the kindness of the good priests in trying to lighten&#xD;
&#xD;
the burden of their trials, and this visit had the&#xD;
desired effect. It kept alive the lamp of hope, and&#xD;
gave them heart to go through their duties, which&#xD;
sometimes of late became irksome as the idea would&#xD;
present itself to their minds that a stranger might&#xD;
be brought in to-reap the benefit of their toil. So&#xD;
it was with the other tenantry, the fellow-sufferers&#xD;
of Toney, most of whom repaired to Father Esmond,&#xD;
asking his advice how they should act, and wishing&#xD;
to know if his reverence would recommend them&#xD;
to make a personal application to the landlord.&#xD;
They were all prevented from doing so by the .priest,&#xD;
who detailed to them the noble appeal made in&#xD;
their behalf by Mr. De Courey, and assured them&#xD;
every such application would be met by insult.&#xD;
He consoled them all lie could, told them to keep&#xD;
quiet and go on conducting themselves properly,&#xD;
as they had always done, and thus they would dis-&#xD;
arm the most malicious of their enemies. Those&#xD;
who did not come to him-they were but four, in&#xD;
eluding Toney Byrne-he visited and consoled.&#xD;
One only man went to the landlord, contrary to&#xD;
the advice of his best friends. He was a fine, stout&#xD;
farmer, named Mat Doran, an upright, honest man,&#xD;
the only support of a blind father, who had lost his&#xD;
sight by a premature explosion in a quarry in which&#xD;
&#xD;

4&#xD;
&#xD;
he was working, and a helpless brother who was&#xD;
born an idiot the day after the explosion. As Mat&#xD;
lead never injured a human being, and had ever&#xD;
nobly done his duty to all around him, he could not&#xD;
be made to believe that his landlord would be so&#xD;
unjust, and therefore resolved to have a talk with&#xD;
him himself. Giving the knocker a single blow,&#xD;
sufficient to drive a tenpenny nail at least, the door&#xD;
was flung open by a singular specimen of humanity&#xD;
dressed in black livery, with lace epauletts and a&#xD;
powdered wig. He was not by any means the best&#xD;
proportioned man in "that section of country," as&#xD;
a Yankee would say, having a rotund corporation&#xD;
and very slim supporters, set off in fine black silken&#xD;
hose, and low shoes with ponderous silver buckles,&#xD;
The creature was further adorned with blear eyes&#xD;
and a very sallow complexion.&#xD;
Upon Mat Doran stating that he wanted to see&#xD;
Mr. Biggs, his landlord, upon some business relating&#xD;
to his farm,, the powdered lacquey stared at him&#xD;
with his blear eyes in the utmost amazement. " Go&#xD;
and tell him acushla," says Mat, " for the horses is&#xD;
waitin' for me in the field." The footman gruffly&#xD;
slammed the door, leaving the farmer standing out&#xD;
side.&#xD;
In a few minutes he returned with word that the&#xD;
&#xD;
Rev. Mr. Biggs never held conversation with his&#xD;
tenantry. lie had employed an agent for that pur-&#xD;
pose, Mr. De Courcy, of the Cascade Mills, and to&#xD;
him he should apply. This message was delivered&#xD;
with all the insolence which could be displayed by&#xD;
a pampered menial. Mat Doran, who 'had a large&#xD;
amount of waggery in his composition, was deter-&#xD;
mined to have a little fun if he had no justice ; he&#xD;
accordingly stepped into the hall, stuck his head&#xD;
one side, and putting his arms on his brawny lips,&#xD;
inspected admiringly the scanty supporters in the&#xD;
black-silk hose, and then the powdered wig. "Beau.&#xD;
tiful! beautiful !" exclaimed Mat. "I declare to&#xD;
my Kitty, but it makes one strong to see such a fine&#xD;
pair of legs. What do you feed your calves on, allan-&#xD;
nah ? Upon my conscience I'd like to have the re-&#xD;
sate, for they're the thrivin' pair intirely ; you ought&#xD;
to send them to the next cattle show, and you'll be&#xD;
sure to get the pramium!&#xD;
The man with the limited understandings was in&#xD;
a rage, and cried, "Begone, you insulting fellow!!"&#xD;
But he took care to draw back from the dangerous&#xD;
looking fists of the stout farmer. "Aisey! avic;&#xD;
aisey !" cried the tantalizing Mat. "If you move too&#xD;
fast you'll crack your legs acrass, and sure that 'id&#xD;
be the sin of the world, so it would, for they're&#xD;

the very shape for all the world of a decayed&#xD;

"Begone, fellow! I say, instantly !" Mat now burst&#xD;
into a guffaw of a laugh, and made the halls of the&#xD;
castle re-echo with his merriment. "May the divil&#xD;
fly away wid the man that brought you to Wickla;&#xD;
anyway he had a cruel taste for music. Is that the&#xD;
kind of a shape yiz have in England? That I&#xD;
mightn't sin, but.if we had such a beauty as you&#xD;
born in Ireland we'd make a fortune exhibiting him.&#xD;
Good mornin', avourneen !". And Mat walked out&#xD;
leisurely, laughing vociferously.&#xD;
This harmless raillery afterwards cost poor Mat&#xD;
Doran his farm, and threw himself and all he loved&#xD;
on the world.&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
MAY" was treading close upon the heels " of June&#xD;
when the school-house was completed. The Rev-&#xD;
erend Samuel Wilson Biggs, taking counsel with his&#xD;
sisters, came. to the conclusion that it would be&#xD;
scarcely safe to spend some hours a day in a build-&#xD;
ing erected so recently; and besides, being so near&#xD;
July, the vacation time, it would not be worth while&#xD;
to open the school until autumn. It was therefore&#xD;
agreed to spend the summer hunting up the right&#xD;
sort of teachers at the lowest rate of remuneration.&#xD;
The building of the church was progressing rap-&#xD;
idly also, and was expected to be ready for service&#xD;
before winter, to the great delight of Mr. Job&#xD;
Scruggins-the blear-eyed man with the limited un-&#xD;
derstandings-who declared "it was perfectly un-&#xD;
endoorable for a gemman to hascend these orful 'igh&#xD;
'ills every Sunday, not to speak of the natooral dis-&#xD;
gust a refined pusson must feel meeting so many&#xD;
low Ilirish."&#xD;
The fact was, Job found it no easy task to pre-&#xD;
serve his equilibrium standing behind the carriage&#xD;

&#xD;
going over Cascade Hill, and as he swung from'one&#xD;
foot to another, in order to balance himself, laugh-&#xD;
ing faces peeped at him from cottage doers or&#xD;
mountain bye-paths, and some joke would be per-&#xD;
petrated at the expense of his undeveloped perpen-&#xD;
diculars. As Mr. Job Scruggins did not resemble&#xD;
his namesake in patience, lie shook his silver-&#xD;
mounted pole at the delinquents in a very threaten-&#xD;
ing manner, a proceeding which was repaid by a&#xD;
shout of derisive laughter from a group of merry&#xD;
urchins who followed the carriage, and one of&#xD;
whom-to show his particular appreciation of the&#xD;
fun-always threw his legs into the air and walked&#xD;
several yards on his hands, head downwards--an&#xD;
accomplishment which he had brought to great per-&#xD;
fection by constant practice.&#xD;
During the summer the Misses Biggs called in&#xD;
their carriage at all the laborers' cottages,,to ascer-&#xD;
tain the number of children in each, and to bear to&#xD;
the hitherto benighted parents the joyful intelligence&#xD;
that "they would soon have an opportunity of havy&#xD;
ing their children educated, as their considerate&#xD;
landlord, ever anxious for their welfare, both here&#xD;
and hereafter, had actually built a school-house for&#xD;
their use, and was about einploying a male and a&#xD;
female teacher to impart useful knowledge."&#xD;
&#xD;
Exchanging looks of commiseration for these&#xD;
ignorant peasants, the ladies drew sighs of profound&#xD;
regret when they found not one single parent pre-&#xD;
pared to rejoice at the good fortune in store for&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Some seemed to turn pale at the news. Some&#xD;
said their children went to school to Tinmanogue,&#xD;
others to Ardmore; others again thought their chil-&#xD;
dren too small yet; some could not spare them&#xD;
from home, etc., etc. On the fourth day of their&#xD;
unsuccessful canvass, on return to the castle, Miss&#xD;
Rachael expressed her dissatisfaction by declaring&#xD;
she never met such unthankful people in her life.&#xD;
It was her positive conviction they were not a bit&#xD;
pleased to have such a. splendid chance to educate&#xD;
their children. She would not be surprised now if&#xD;
they would prefer-keeping them at home, or send-&#xD;
ing them to those old villages with the odious names.&#xD;
Both sisters laughed contemptuously at such schools,&#xD;
" where the pupils are taught nothing but to wor-&#xD;
ship the Virgin Mary, and adore images."&#xD;
Miss Biggs, in the. excess of charity, checked her&#xD;
scorn and reprimanded her sister: "My dear Rachael,&#xD;
we must have pity on those ignorant creatures,&#xD;
bearing in mind how much the Lord hath favored&#xD;
our happy country, where the blessings of His word&#xD;

are so liberally dispensed, and where the population&#xD;
walketh in righteousness. Let us not despair if our&#xD;
footsteps are as yet unmarked by success. We can&#xD;
afford to watch and wait. You know it is written,&#xD;
"For the Lord bath built up Zion, and he shall be&#xD;
seen in His glory." It is-a great mark of the mercies&#xD;
of the Lord that he bath vouchsafed to put these&#xD;
unfortunate people into the safe keeping of so godly&#xD;
a man as our reverend brother, and we must even&#xD;
try to. arouse him to use his temporal as well as&#xD;
spiritual authority in such a sanctified cause. Be&#xD;
not daunted,-my sister; let us go with refreshened&#xD;
hearts to the good work on to-morrow again. Hith-&#xD;
erto we have visited only the cottages of the labor-&#xD;
ers; let us now try the farm-houses, and see what&#xD;
success we may have amongst those of the tenantry&#xD;
who have no leases. I fear me we would make but lit-&#xD;

people."&#xD;
Well, sister, I will chasten my spirit and accom-&#xD;

And so day after day the carriage was winding&#xD;
through the hills, ever and anon stopping at the&#xD;
white farm-houses with the trailing vines&#xD;
&#xD;
The personal appearance of these elderly young&#xD;
ladies, barring their rich dresses, was by no means&#xD;
prepossessing; but were they as beautiful as Venus,&#xD;
it would be all the same to the Glengoulah tenantry.&#xD;
The bare sight of them brought heavy grief to many&#xD;
a once happy hearth. Well they now knew why&#xD;
their leases were withheld, and in terror and dismay&#xD;
they fled to their loved pastor for consolation. Poor&#xD;
Father Esmond wept with then, for he saw at a&#xD;
glance the whole map of persecution laid before&#xD;
them, and lie could but point to the cross, and ex&#xD;
hort them to have courage and patience.&#xD;
" My poor, poor children! " he would say, v hue&#xD;
tears coursed each other down his venerable face,&#xD;
"remember the eighth Beatitude: 'Blessed are they&#xD;
who suffer persecution for justice sake, for theirs is&#xD;
the Kingdom of Heaven.'  These are the words of&#xD;
our Blessed Redeemer himself, and He wont de-&#xD;
ceive you. This life is but short after all, my dear&#xD;
people, and soon, oh ! soon we shall all meet in our&#xD;

er would say:&#xD;
"Oh, Father, honey ! I could bear anything my..&#xD;
self; but what will I do with my poor children ?"&#xD;
And then there would be a chorus of mothers sob-&#xD;
bing in sympathy. Thus did this pretended minis-&#xD;
ter of the gentle and merciful Jesus bring wailing&#xD;
and desolation to the homes of those simple, virtu-&#xD;
ous people.&#xD;
On the feast of the Assumption of our Blessed&#xD;
Lady, August 15th, Father O'Tool preached a most&#xD;
eloquent discourse to the tenantry in the little mnoun&#xD;
tai chapel of Glengoulah. It was on a Wed nesday,&#xD;
and the Biggs school was to be opened the follow-&#xD;
ing Monday-a notice to that effect having been&#xD;
sent to all the farm-houses. Everybody was anxious&#xD;
to hear what the zealous young curate had to say-on&#xD;
the subject, for they knew lie would be sure to give&#xD;
it his earnest attention; therefore the gathering was&#xD;
unusually large, many coming from the townland of&#xD;
Tinmanogue and' the adjoining parish of Ardmore.&#xD;
It was a pleasing sight to see groups of people&#xD;
wending their way by so many different roads up&#xD;
the hill to the picturesque little chapel which peeped&#xD;
out at them from a grove, and seemed to smile a&#xD;
&#xD;
welcome as its little painted cross glittered in the&#xD;
sunlight.&#xD;
Most of the men, the young ones in particular,&#xD;
wore blue body coats with bright brass buttons,&#xD;
yellow or light-colored vests, gray neckties, and well-&#xD;
brushed "Caroline hats," breeches of white or drab&#xD;
corduroy, from the knee of which a knot of the&#xD;
same colored ribbon fluttered in the breeze, while&#xD;
the well-greased pumps and spotless woollen stock-&#xD;
ings showed off the arched instep and splendidly&#xD;
developed calves to perfection.&#xD;
The women vied with each other in bright man-&#xD;
tles glorying in hoods of quilted silk, and substantial&#xD;
looking bonnets of beaver with gay ribbons, while&#xD;
many of the young maidens wore; large hats with&#xD;
flying ribbons, after the fashion, of their Welch&#xD;
neighbors across the channel.&#xD;
Families who lived at a distance came in the well-&#xD;
known low-backed car. Very many of the farmers'&#xD;
wives rode on billions behind their husbands.&#xD;
Some of the Catholic gentry and wealthy farmers,&#xD;
also shop-keepers from Ardmore, came in jaunting&#xD;
cars and gigs, but the greater number were pedes-&#xD;
trians. It was amusing to watch some country&#xD;
swain showing off his horsemanship, the charge&#xD;
being unable to alter from a sling trot if it cost him&#xD;

his life, while his rider rose and fell in the saddle,&#xD;
very much to his own satisfaction, until lie gained&#xD;
the side of a group of pedestrians, in the centre of&#xD;
whom was a rural belle equally celebrated for her&#xD;
beauty and her coquetry. It was quite plain, from&#xD;
the smile on her lip, that she knew perfectly well&#xD;
who was reining up close beside her, but she- was&#xD;
paying such profound attention to the conversation&#xD;
of a sober-looking young man who walked with her&#xD;
that she never once turned around until the head of the&#xD;
steed, peeping over her shoulder, made her give the&#xD;
prettiest little start and exclamation of surprise.&#xD;
Just at this juncture a large open carriage dashed&#xD;
by, containing four finely-dressed ladies and two&#xD;
ditto gentlemen, not forgetting the fat coachman&#xD;
and another burly looking gentleman sitting beside&#xD;
him, dressed in black, with a blue satin cravat, in&#xD;
which were jauntily stuck two gold pins with enor-'&#xD;
mous heads, resembling the Lord Mayor's mace,&#xD;
and both fastened together by a slender gold chain.&#xD;
The left hand was partly hidden in a canary-colored&#xD;
kid glove, while the right was uncovered for the&#xD;
evident purpose of displaying a couple of heavy&#xD;
rings; and from the upper vest pocket to the button-&#xD;
hole, back again to the lower pocket, and then for a&#xD;
quarter of a yard down, hung dangling a massive&#xD;

&#xD;
chain, thick enough for fetters, at the termination of&#xD;
which was a bunch of seals and keys the size of a&#xD;
kitten's head. The two gentlemen seated in the&#xD;
carriage were similarly attired, and sat with their&#xD;
knees touching each other on the outward rim of&#xD;
the cushion to accommodate the four ladies, who&#xD;
reclined back, for the double purpose of seeming at&#xD;
their perfect ease and to make the carriage -hold&#xD;
six, whereas it was lawfully intended for four. One&#xD;
of the ladies was an elderly female of rotund figure,&#xD;
good-looking, and dressed as became a staid matron;&#xD;
while the three young ones were bedizened in silks,&#xD;
laces, and jewelry, and were nearly in convulsions&#xD;
of laughter at the costume of the peasantry.&#xD;
"I do wish you would not giggle so, Beckey,"&#xD;
said the matron to the youngest of the ladies, who&#xD;
sat opposite to her; " I-know, to be sure, the dress of&#xD;
these here country people is wery haggrawatin', but&#xD;
then we must not forget the big'gulf of difference as&#xD;
lies 'atween us, seeing' 'ow we 'ad the hadwantage&#xD;

"Well, mother, I can't help a larfin' to save my&#xD;

mantle of a 'ot day in Hawgust; if she wouldn't'&#xD;
make a dog larf I'll never say nothink again."&#xD;
" Oh, dear! I shall die of merriment; I know I&#xD;
shall ;" said another of the young ladies, who had&#xD;
been gracefully occupied during this conversation&#xD;
in stuffing a cambric handkerchief into her mouth.&#xD;
"I shall 'ate merriment for evermore if you do,"&#xD;
remarked the young gentleman beside her, giving&#xD;
her a nudge with his elbow, and trying tolook ten-&#xD;
derly under her bonnet.&#xD;
"Keep your sharp helbows to yourself, Mr. Serug-&#xD;
gins," cried the offended young lady, with an assump-&#xD;
tion of great dignity.&#xD;
"I didn't mean hany hoffence, Miss Jenkins," re-&#xD;
plied the accused; "you are really too hicy cold to&#xD;
an 'art what hadores you." Another nudge and ten-&#xD;
der glance followed this speech.&#xD;
"Keep your protestations for them as values them,&#xD;
for I don't." And she cast a look of pitiful contempt&#xD;
on the young lady opposite, who seemed to be carry-&#xD;
ing on with great gusto a flirtation with her neigh.-&#xD;
bor, and smiling her best at the young farmers as&#xD;
they passed.&#xD;
"'Old your tongues now, all on you; 'ere we are at&#xD;
the Popish mass 'ouse, and hif they see hany of us&#xD;
a larfin' they wont let us hin."  The last remark&#xD;
&#xD;
was made by the matron as the carriage came to a&#xD;
full stop, and the party, trying to look very grave&#xD;
and grand, alighkted.&#xD;
Upon asking an old man with a wooden leg and&#xD;
crutch whether they might go in, he skewed them&#xD;
into a prominent seat on a long bench near the altar-&#xD;
rail-a mark of courtesy to strangers. They imme-&#xD;
diately commenced staring every one who entered&#xD;
the chapel, lounging for greater convenience on the&#xD;
back of the bench, and twirling their heads in every&#xD;
direction.&#xD;
As the congregation came in each of them made&#xD;
a genuflexion, often differing in form, and some not&#xD;
the most graceful, but all precious in the sight of&#xD;
God, for whose dear love those faithful hearts bowed&#xD;
in lowly adoration after the fashion their simple&#xD;
minds deemed best. The oft-repeated crossing and&#xD;
genuflexions were a source of much suppressed mirth&#xD;
to the strange party, but when the priest came out&#xD;
in his alb, previous to vesting himself, followed by&#xD;
the man with the crutch carrying a bucket of holy&#xD;
water,- into which the priest dipped the asperges&#xD;
and sprinkled the congregation while they remained&#xD;
standing, and the crossing and genuflexions were&#xD;
repeated, a low titter might be heard, which would&#xD;
certainly havo broken out and ended by the expul-&#xD;

sion of the whole party from the chapel but for the&#xD;
frowns and threatening gestures of th) matron, who&#xD;
looked carving-knives at each, and shook her head&#xD;
Severely. This matron was the housekeeper of.&#xD;
Glengoulai Castle. The youngest of the party,&#xD;
whom she called "Beckey," was her daughter Re-&#xD;
becca, who assisted in her household duties. The&#xD;
other two young ladies were our former fair acquaint.&#xD;
tances Miss Jemina and Miss Amelia Hopkins. The&#xD;
burly gentleman who sat beside the coachman was&#xD;
Mr. Selling, the head butler. The young gentle-&#xD;
man who carried on the comfortable flirtation with&#xD;
Miss Hopkins was Mr. Tomnpson, " master's hown&#xD;
man;" and the discomfitted young gentleman who&#xD;
was reproved for the sharpness of his elbows, was&#xD;
our friend of the slender supporters, Mr. Job Scrug-&#xD;
gins, no longer in velvet smalls and silken hose,&#xD;
with a cockade in his hat and a gold-mounted pole&#xD;
in his hand--no longer trying to balance himself on&#xD;
the back of the carriage going over " those villainous&#xD;
'ills," but dressed like any gentleman, with long trou-&#xD;
sers of broadcloth, and everything else to match, sit-&#xD;
ting inside the carriage, and bright eyes smiling,&#xD;
around him- and a fair chance to have some fun at&#xD;
the expense of " the wild Hirish," now that his up-&#xD;
rights were hidden from mortal vision. A holiday&#xD;
&#xD;
had been given to most of the upper servants on the&#xD;
condition of their first visiting the Popish mass&#xD;
house, in order to bring home the pith of Father&#xD;
O'Tool's discourse regarding the schools ; the re-&#xD;
mainder of the day they might drive through any&#xD;
part of the country they wished, and take a cold&#xD;
dinner with them if they so desired.&#xD;
Accordingly a well-filled hamper was fastened be&#xD;
hind the carriage, and the party, nothing loth, com-&#xD;
menced the sports of the day by inspecting the bar-&#xD;
barous natives in their house of worship.&#xD;
Just as Father O'Tool fiiishled hearing some-&#xD;
fessions in the sacristy he heard a man inquiring&#xD;
from one of the acholytes if lie was disengaged.&#xD;
Approaching the door he saw Tom Moody, who:im-&#xD;
mediately pulled off his hat, and whispering behind&#xD;
it said, "lie came to let his reverence know that a&#xD;
carriage had just stopped at, the chapel door, and a&#xD;
whole set of the servants from the castle had gone&#xD;
in, with the probable intention of remaining during&#xD;
mass."&#xD;
"very good, Tom; I hope they have got a com-&#xD;
fortable seat."&#xD;
"The best in the chapel, your reverence."&#xD;
" That's right.' I am glad they have come; very&#xD;
glad, indeed. I hope. they;have good mnenories."&#xD;

Tom, making a scrape to his reverence, left him&#xD;
to vest and went into the chapel. After the distri-&#xD;
bution of holy water the Adorable Sacrifice. com-&#xD;
menced, during which the conduct of the castle peo-&#xD;
ple tried the patience of the congregation to the ut-&#xD;
most, sneering up in their faces during prayer,&#xD;
nudging and tittering at sight of beads, and staring&#xD;
withignorant astonishment when the whole congre-&#xD;
gation were bowed almost to prostration at the ring-&#xD;
ing of the consecration bell.&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
AFER the communion the priest turned around,&#xD;
read the Gospel of the day, and made a few remarks&#xD;
on the time-honored festival of the Assumption of&#xD;
our Blessed Lady.&#xD;
He then announced to them that on the Monday&#xD;
following a school would be opened by their land-&#xD;
lord, the Rev. Samuel Wilson Biggs, for the avowed&#xD;
purpose of proselytizing the children on the estate.&#xD;
"Woe to you, people of Glengoulah ! " said he,&#xD;
"if, at the bidding of any man-be lie landlord, or&#xD;
nabob, or monarch--woe to you! if you place in&#xD;
peril one of those tender souls for which your dear&#xD;
Saviour shed his most precious blood.  Your clil-&#xD;
dren have hitherto been educated in a manner&#xD;
befitting their station; and, above all, they have been&#xD;
thoroughly instructed in the true faith of Christ--&#xD;
and your venerable pastor has reason-to rejoice in&#xD;
his virtuous flock. To God be the glory given !&#xD;
From this, His holy altar, I warn you against the&#xD;
wiles of the Serpent. Remember, you are but stew-&#xD;

time in this world is but short; and when you depart&#xD;
hence and stand all alone, with God alone as your&#xD;
judge, where will you hide from His wrath when&#xD;
le will demand from you in a voice of thunder,&#xD;
blood for blood?    But, why do I speak thus?&#xD;
Surely I forget that I am addressing the descendants&#xD;
of heroes ! the children of the saints ! You well&#xD;
know that every inch of the soil of holy Ireland is&#xD;
watered by the blood of her martyrs, who sufferea&#xD;
every species of torture the evil genius of tyrants&#xD;
could invent-the pitch cap, the triangle, the gibbet,&#xD;
impaling upon spears, burning at the stake, tracked&#xD;
by blood-hounds, hunted like wolves, and starved&#xD;
by an artificial famine; but they nobly suffered all&#xD;
and preserved to their descendants the priceless&#xD;
inheritance of the true faith ! It is not you-faithful&#xD;
children of those martyred heroes !-it is not you who&#xD;
will sell for a mess of such pitiful pottage this mag-&#xD;
nificent inheritance! this grand old faith ! which has&#xD;
stood unchanged for more than eighteen hundred&#xD;
years. Tell your landlord, or his messengers, that&#xD;
in all that relates to the payment of hisjust demands,&#xD;
you will obey him; but you will not send your chil-&#xD;
dren to his schools. You don't want his interference&#xD;
in your family affairs, and you will have none of it.&#xD;
Commit no breach of the peace; but let him under&#xD;
&#xD;
stand, once forall; that he is. exceeding the bounds&#xD;
of his duty, and that as you are not exceeding yours&#xD;
you will feel obliged if he will keep to his. It is&#xD;
quite too much for you to support a church in which&#xD;
you have no faith; but to resign to its ministers the&#xD;
education of yourchildren is beyond all endurance,&#xD;
and neither you nor your pastors will permit it."&#xD;
Much more he said, and- in more eloquent lan-&#xD;
guage than can be remembered after such a lapse of&#xD;
time. Nearly the whole congregation were in tears,&#xD;
and those who were independent of the landlord&#xD;
were burning with indignation at his conduct.&#xD;
Mass was finished and the congregation dispersed;&#xD;
some to their homes, some to the houses of acquaint-&#xD;
ances in the neighborhood; while 'many groups of&#xD;
ipen, reclining against the ditches or sitting in the&#xD;
grass, held consultation together over the sad aspect&#xD;
of the future. Seated.in the centre of the large t&#xD;
of those groups was an old man with a wooden leg&#xD;
and a crutch, who seemed.to be relating something&#xD;
of great interest to his auditors, as many who at first&#xD;
reclined on one elbow now sat upright, and leaning&#xD;
their chins on their hands gazed eagerly in 'his&#xD;
face, now and then giving vent to exclamations of&#xD;
surprise, pleasure, or anger, as their feelings moved&#xD;
them.&#xD;

"Bravo, Jerry! be gor its true for yees. Oh, the&#xD;

" What's right enagh ? No! but it's plottin' how&#xD;

"But the brazen-faced lies of them is what kills&#xD;
me: calling' every other nation despots and them-&#xD;
selves lovers of liberty."&#xD;
"Oh, the lying' divils! Sure they couldn't tell the&#xD;
truth if they tried, so they cou ldn't."&#xD;
This wooden-legged old man was Jerry O'Hara,&#xD;
J    who had served many years in the British army as&#xD;
an artillery-man, had been all through the Peninsu-&#xD;
lar war, and had finally lost a leg at Waterloo, for&#xD;
which he received a pension, and lived comfortably&#xD;
in his native village of Ardmore. Having little to&#xD;
occupy his time, "Lame Jerry," as he was usually&#xD;
called, spent most of his time reading; and, having&#xD;
a retentive memory, he was a perfect oracle among.&#xD;
the peasantry, and an ever welcome visitor to their&#xD;
firesides.&#xD;
Although a most faithful soldier when in service,-&#xD;
now that he was out of it Jerry was accustomed to&#xD;
deliver his opinions very freely on the short-comings&#xD;
&#xD;
of the Government, and especially the abominable&#xD;
laws relating to landlord and tenant, and the odious&#xD;
Church Establishment.&#xD;
In order to strengthen his arguments Jerry hunted&#xD;
up every work which treated on the subject of land&#xD;
tenures in all the countries of Europe, and was quite&#xD;
familiar with the modes of tillage, the products, and&#xD;
particularly the relative positions of landlord and&#xD;
tenant in France, Italy, Switzerland, and Germany.&#xD;
On the occasion in question he was detailing to his&#xD;
listeners, in a high-flown strain of eloquence, the&#xD;
condition of the serfs in Russia, which he had been&#xD;
making his study of late, and contrasting them with&#xD;
the Irish peasantry under the-free and enlightened&#xD;
British Government. " The Russian serf," said Lame&#xD;
Jerry-laying down the case on the.pahn of his left&#xD;
hand with the two forefingers of his right-" the&#xD;
Russian serf is elevated far in condition beyond the&#xD;
Irish peasant. He never experienced the bitterness&#xD;
of beggary. In his days of misfortune he has not&#xD;
suffered the agony of choosing between the alterna-&#xD;
tive of being separated from every tie of affection,&#xD;
which is next to death, or of dying of starvation.&#xD;
The serf's wife is his wife, and he can keep his vows&#xD;
to her as God has willed it. The serfs children are&#xD;
his children, and he can watch over theme from child&#xD;

hood to manhood." (Jerry was probably alluding&#xD;
to the cruel separation of husband and wife, parents&#xD;
and children, in the Government poor-houses in Ire-&#xD;
land.)&#xD;
"In all Russia there is not a single work-house,&#xD;
a single poor-law board, or a single pauper. The&#xD;
cow of the Russian serf is never distrained for&#xD;
rent or taxes. The cabin of the Russian serf is&#xD;
never thrown down unless another is built in its&#xD;
stead. If he is prostrated by sickness, he is cared&#xD;
and tended at the cost of the lord of the soil. If&#xD;
murrain destroys his cattle, or a 'bad season blights&#xD;
his harvest, the noble has to replace his stock or&#xD;
sow his land. The serf pays no county ces, or&#xD;
poor rate, or income tax; nothing but his obiok or&#xD;
head rent. For this the proprietor gives up his&#xD;
domain to the serfs for cultivation and management.&#xD;
For this he is accountable for their losses and for,&#xD;
their support in sickness and in age. And those&#xD;
people are called serfs, and their monarch a despot!&#xD;
And what do you think, but the present emperor&#xD;
is trying his best to free them even from the name of&#xD;
serfs, and give them a right to the land for ever, to&#xD;
be purchased by them in fe simple, if they desire&#xD;
to do so, by installments. Now contrast this coun-&#xD;
try with Russia, and see the difference! You will&#xD;
&#xD;
find the welfare of the people the study of the sove-&#xD;
reign in Russia ; but show me where you ever&#xD;
found the welfare of the Irish people an object of&#xD;
solicitude to an English monarch ? Even the welfare&#xD;
of the English people is a matter of little anxiety&#xD;
to them. In the city of London, where the mon-&#xD;
arch resides, there is more poverty than in the whole&#xD;
of the Russian empire ! The whole aim of the British&#xD;
Government has ever been to oppress the Irish people&#xD;
and squeeze out of them the last shilling ; and yet&#xD;
their newspapers are ever lauding the glorious&#xD;
British constitution, and they. are particularly elo-&#xD;
quent when they come to denounce the shocking&#xD;
despotism of the Russian Czar ! So I lay it down as&#xD;
a fact that can defy contradiction, that Ireland,&#xD;
which God made one of the richest countries on the&#xD;
face of the earth, both in agricultural and mineral&#xD;
productions, is the poorest and worst governed por-&#xD;
Lion of the globe, under the thrice accursed British&#xD;
-ule." *&#xD;
A round of applause greeted these concluding&#xD;
. mntiments, to which every heart responded, when a&#xD;
nloxse was heard behind the ditch as of a man Ieap-&#xD;
ing dwn and rustling amongst the hawthorn to&#xD;

One of Jerry's auditors, a fine athletic young man,&#xD;
catching the branch of a crab-apple tree which&#xD;
inclined somewhat to the road, swung himself on to&#xD;
the ditch and leaned over, just in time to catch&#xD;
the retreating figure of Sandy McGlauren, who was,&#xD;
passing over a stile into a neighboring field. The&#xD;
young fellow on the ditch, shaking his fist after him,&#xD;
exclaimed&#xD;
" That the divil may Come jumpin' for you, and&#xD;
break every bone in your body, for an would spying'&#xD;
thief! "&#xD;
" Who is it, Darby ?".&#xD;
"'Arrah! tell us who it is, Darby ?" cried several&#xD;
voices, and all started to their feet.&#xD;
" Mlusha ! Who would it be but that divil of a&#xD;
Sandy."&#xD;
A chorus of groans followed the announcement,&#xD;
and then a volley of back-handed prayers were&#xD;
uttered in his behalf, many of which consigned him&#xD;
to a perpetual residence in a remarkably warm cli-&#xD;
mate, not forgetting to request that he should be&#xD;
accompanied by his clerical master, as it would be .&#xD;
a pity to separate such a lovin' couple; more&#xD;
betoken it would be the sin of the world to spoil&#xD;
two houses with them.&#xD;
Alternately perpetrating witticisms, making puns,&#xD;
&#xD;
and praying backwards, at the expense of the uncon-&#xD;
scious Sandy, the party, with Lame Jerry in the&#xD;
centre, wended their way down the mountain and&#xD;
dispersed to their homes. The remainder of the&#xD;
week was spent by the Misses Biggs in making an&#xD;
especial visit to the farm-houses of the "tenants at&#xD;
will," requesting in a most emphatic-manner that&#xD;
the will of theii- reverend brother. should be com-&#xD;
plied with in sending their children to the school he&#xD;
had established for them, and to no other. He ex-&#xD;
pected it, they said, and would take no refusal..&#xD;
Monday came, however, and with it came three&#xD;
pupils-all Protestants. So, as may be supposed,&#xD;
the labors of the male and female teachers, and the&#xD;
Misses Biggs, were not of a very arduous character ;&#xD;
indeed, as Sam Weller would say, "it is just possible&#xD;
they could surwive it."&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE day before the September gale (29th) a for-&#xD;
mal and very stiff note was received by Mr. De&#xD;
Courcy from the Rev. Samuel Wilson Biggs, order-&#xD;
ing Mr. De C. to notify the tenantry that his rev-&#xD;
erence required each and every one of them to send&#xD;
their children to his school, and he would take no&#xD;
excuse. Mr. De Courcy took not the slightest no-&#xD;
tice of the mandate, and made no observation what-,&#xD;
ever relating to the school to any of the tenants.&#xD;
He received their rents and gave them their receipts&#xD;
as usual, and they departed for their homes. In a&#xD;
few days afterwards, however, he paid a visit to&#xD;
Father Esmond, showed him the landlord's imperti-&#xD;
nent missive, and informed him the time had come&#xD;
when he should resign the agency, as he had re-&#xD;
deemed his promise, having kept it as long as it was&#xD;
possible to do any good to the tenantry and retain&#xD;
his own self-respect. That was no longer possible.&#xD;
And now he had determined to resign it, but would&#xD;
not do so without acquainting Father Esmond.&#xD;
The venerable old priest at once saw the iinpossi&#xD;
&#xD;
bility of any honorable-minded man retaining such an&#xD;
office under such a landlord; and, while he acquiesced&#xD;
in his decision, he gave him many thanks and praises&#xD;
for his great forbearance. "It is happy for me, my&#xD;
dear friend," said the priest, "that your good and&#xD;
respected father so considerately purchased this&#xD;
ground for me, and also my schoolhouse, through&#xD;
his influence with old Sir Thomas Plover, or I too&#xD;
should be at the mercy of this tyrant, and my poor&#xD;
people left without a temple to worship in. And,&#xD;
thanks to your further consideration, you obtained a&#xD;
similar privilege for us from the late Sir Charles, so&#xD;
that we have our chapel of ease on the hill, and no&#xD;
thanks to the present incumbent. May God give&#xD;
us all patience! There will be sad hearts all over&#xD;
the estate when the news of your resignation reach-&#xD;
es the tenants. Oh, my poor, persecuted children!&#xD;
my peaceable, happy flock ! to be torn by wolves,&#xD;
and worried by hypocritical wretches, with the name&#xD;
of the tender and loving God upon their lips, and&#xD;
their hearts filled with malignity!."&#xD;
Poor old. Father Esmond paced the room, his&#xD;
hands liehind his back, and his eyes fixed on the&#xD;
floor, as he gave utterance to these expressions:&#xD;
"God protect us all! And 'he calls himself a&#xD;
Christian minister, and writes reverend to his name,&#xD;

&#xD;
and quotes scripture! Oh, God help us! God help&#xD;
us,!"&#xD;
I am really burning with shame, Father Esinond,&#xD;
as a Protestant, to think such things can be done&#xD;
with impunity by one of our ministers, and we are&#xD;
silent, both press and people. If we only heard of&#xD;
one individual Protestant being persecuted in a Cath-&#xD;
olic country, what bursts of eloquence would come&#xD;
daily from our press ! what vast indignation meet-&#xD;
ings would be held! what fine speeches made, and&#xD;
flourishing correspondence carried on between the&#xD;
British envoy and the secretary of state ! I am&#xD;
thoroughly disgusted with such flagrant injustice.&#xD;
There is no fair play for my Catholic fellow-country-&#xD;
man-I see that very plainly---no liberty of con-&#xD;
science for him. Acts of barbarous cruelty are per-&#xD;
petrated daily upon simple, unoffendin g people&#xD;
merely because they are Catholics. And men-other-&#xD;
wise honorable members of society-are content to&#xD;
shrug their shoulders and wash their hands of it. It&#xD;
sickens me to the soul to see it. As a sincere Pro-&#xD;
testant, I am determined not to rest-satisfied until I&#xD;
get this Biggs disgraced from his sacred office. I&#xD;
believe there is truth and justice still to be found&#xD;
amongst our clergy, and I mean to put it to the test.&#xD;
You smile incredulously, Father Esmond; but I do,&#xD;
&#xD;
hope to make my voice heard, both with respect tc&#xD;
liberty of conscience and a satisfactory adjustment&#xD;
of the landlord and tenant question."&#xD;
"Well, God speed you, my dear friend! If you&#xD;
succeed you will confer a priceless benefit on society.&#xD;
I am sure no cause ever had a nobler or more sincere&#xD;
advocate. You will have the most fervent prayers&#xD;
of an ld man, though I have not the slightest faith&#xD;
in your success."&#xD;
The day after this interview Mr. De Courcy's foot-&#xD;
man left the following note at Glengoulah Castle&#xD;
" Mr. De Courcy, having received a very imperti-&#xD;
nent comninication on the 27iti September last&#xD;
from the Rev. Samuel Wilson Biggs, wishes to in-&#xD;
form that individual that he, Mr. De Courcy, held&#xD;
the agency of the Glengoulah estates under the late&#xD;
Sir Charles Plover for twenty-five years, but he has&#xD;
never yet been agent for a proselytizing institution,&#xD;
nor does lie intend lending his services for so vile a&#xD;
purpose.&#xD;
"Mr. De Courcy further informs the above-named&#xD;
person that from the 29th of said month he has&#xD;
ceasedto be the agent for the Glengoulah estates, as&#xD;
he purposes never to have his name connected with&#xD;
any man who has not the instincts of a gentleman.&#xD;

&#xD;
Next morning Sandy McGiauren called at the&#xD;
office for the accounts and documents relating to&#xD;
the estates, which were delivered to him by one of&#xD;
the clerks. And so Glengoulah Castle and estates&#xD;
passed from all honest hands, and the hundreds of&#xD;
hard-working, upright peasantry who dwelt thereon&#xD;
were altogether in the unholy keeping of knaves&#xD;
and tyrants..&#xD;
Great the grief and loud the lamentations of that&#xD;
once happy tenantry when the intelligence was pro-&#xD;
claimed that their much-loved Mr. De Courcy had&#xD;
ceased to be connected with Glengoulah. Tears&#xD;
bedewed every face, and a wail arose from every&#xD;
homestead, such as in Egypt of old awoke Pharaoh&#xD;
from his dream: of security when heart-broken&#xD;
mothers and grief-stricken fathers mourned with a&#xD;
great cry the death of their first-born.&#xD;
The Rev. Samuel Wilson Biggs did not remain&#xD;
long without an agent. le appointed one Jacob&#xD;
Margin as his representative with the tenantry of&#xD;
Glengoulah. lie could scarcely have shown a wiser&#xD;
discrimination in his choice, for there never was a&#xD;
more fitting representative of his master, or a more&#xD;
convenient tool to perform any disreputable deed.&#xD;
It will be here necessary to give a short sketch of&#xD;
Mr. Jacob Margin's doings before he was appointed&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BYRNES OF GLENGOULAH.        153&#xD;
agent for the Glengoulah estates. This hoary old&#xD;
miscreant was both dreaded and detested by every&#xD;
one of his poorer.neighbors. Public report said he.&#xD;
could not tell who his own father was. It is certain,&#xD;
however, he was of low   extraction, for he was&#xD;
brought from a distantcounty years ago as a land&#xD;
steward to the estate of a Colonel Ranford, an ab-&#xD;
sentee, who had spent his fortune at the Cheltenham&#xD;
Waters in England. Margin arose by trickery until&#xD;
he became agent to the Clonbeggin estate (Colonel&#xD;
Ranford's property), and also to the Bannow Navi-&#xD;
gation Company, and finally to the mining company&#xD;
of the neighboring district. Having made himself&#xD;
thoroughly acquainted with the state of Colonel&#xD;
Ranford's finances, and finding he indulged in play,&#xD;
Margin strongly advised him to remain in England,&#xD;
representing it as an impossibility that any gentle-&#xD;
man could reside in Ireland in consequence of the&#xD;
lawless condition of the people. It was not his&#xD;
fault if this statement were incorrect, for he tried&#xD;
his best to drive the whole country to distraction,&#xD;
and partially succeeded with the Clonbeggin tenan-&#xD;
try, and with all the cottiers, laborers and miners&#xD;
who had the misfortune to come under his sway.&#xD;
lie had not been more than five years installed as&#xD;
agent to Clonbeggin when Colonel Ranford found&#xD;

&#xD;
himself in very embarrassed circumstances, with an&#xD;
aimy of duns at his heels. Making some ineffectual&#xD;
efforts to curtail his expenses, he ordered Margin to&#xD;
sell a portion of his unentailed property, and so year&#xD;
by year and bit by bit he sold all his ancestral acres&#xD;
which the law would allow hiu to dispose of; at an&#xD;
immense sacrifice-the agent declaring it was a most&#xD;
difficult matter to find purchasers, owing to the dis-&#xD;
turbed state of the country. The colonel then or-&#xD;
dered the entailed portion to be mortgaged, and at&#xD;
the end of fifteen years he was so hopelessly involved&#xD;
as to be obliged to fly to the Continent to avoid his&#xD;
creditors. Just at this period his only son came of&#xD;
age, and, in order to check any aspirations after ex-&#xD;
pensive pleasures, the colonel told him the desperate&#xD;
state of his affairs.&#xD;
Mr. Horatio Ranford, who was blessed with more&#xD;
sense than his father, decided upon starting at once&#xD;
for Ireland, and try to manage the estate himself.&#xD;
We may imagine, but cannot describe, his indigna-&#xD;
tion on finding that Mr. Jacob Margin-or Jab, as&#xD;
he was nicknamed by the peasantry--had been&#xD;
enriching himself at his father's expense. Every&#xD;
portion of Col. Ranford's property which had been&#xD;
sold had been purchased by Margin himself. Every&#xD;
pound which had been advanced upon the mortga&#xD;

&#xD;
ges came from the. pocket of Margin at a ruinous&#xD;
interest.&#xD;
Many a noble tree, too, in the beautiful wood of&#xD;
Cloibeggin, which clothed the hillside overhanging&#xD;
the river Bannow, was cut down and sold, and&#xD;
many more were marked for destruction. Such was&#xD;
the state of affairs at Clonbeggin when Mr.. Horatio&#xD;
Ranford arrived from England.&#xD;
Transported with fury -when he discovered the&#xD;
perfidy of Margin, he at once dismissed himn from&#xD;
the agency, and immediately employed a lawyer to&#xD;
investigate matters, and, if possible, prosecute then&#xD;
old scoundrel ; but the wily rascal had every doen-&#xD;
ment so legally drawn up that he defied prosecution,&#xD;
and coolly presented his accounts, showing Colonel&#xD;
Ranford to be £1,500 in his debt. The colonel's&#xD;
estate lay contiguous to that part-of the County Wick-&#xD;
low where the coal mines were situated, and, as&#xD;
" Jab" was of a very industrious turn of mind, he&#xD;
took contracts to work them from the mining coin-&#xD;
pany. His transactions with this company were&#xD;
worthy the genius of the demon himself. He&#xD;
worked the mines so expensively that for a good&#xD;
while it was all outlay and no return. The com-&#xD;
pany grumbled, became disheartened, and at length&#xD;
stopped the vorks. To facilitate matters, "Jab"&#xD;

156      THE BYRNES OFa GLENGOULAK.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BYRNES OF GLENGOULAH.      157&#xD;
&#xD;
succeeded in damming up the course of a stream&#xD;
which ran by his house, and thus overflowed the&#xD;
whole mines, including the pits on the estate of'&#xD;
Lord Wallingford, which extended for miles on the&#xD;
slope of the hill below the water-course.&#xD;
Upon the plea of removing an evil which he pre-&#xD;
tended very much to deplore, old "Jab" built a&#xD;
wall around an island in the river, called "Moll&#xD;
Cody's island" (from an old crone who dwelt there&#xD;
alone). It actually belonged to the County Wexford,&#xD;
but "Jab" filled up the stream on the Wicklow side,&#xD;
and deepened the bed of the river behind it, so that&#xD;
the stream changed its course, the island disappear-&#xD;
ed, or rather became the main land, and formed a&#xD;
position of the farm of Mr. Jacob Margin.&#xD;
It was apparently an insignificant addition to his&#xD;
possessions, being only a couple of acres in extent.&#xD;
But of Margin it might be truly said he looked&#xD;
below the surface of things, for his experienced eye&#xD;
saw that a valuable bed of coal lay underneath the&#xD;
island, which he intended to turn. to good account.&#xD;
While he protested " the everlasting gratitude of the&#xD;
people was due to him for spending both time and&#xD;
money turning the course of the stream in order to&#xD;
free the pits from water and give employment to&#xD;
the miners, it made his heart ache to see so many&#xD;
&#xD;
hundreds thrown out of work." Notwithstanding&#xD;
all his protestations, however, the water did not&#xD;
move from the pits, and Lord Wallingford's engi-&#xD;
neers were ungrateful enough to say he did it to&#xD;
enrich himself.&#xD;
His lordship thereupon commenced a law-suit&#xD;
with Margin for abstracting a portion of the Coun-&#xD;
ty Wexford contrary to statutes made and provided.&#xD;
lIe employed barristers' of high standing to plead&#xD;
his cause, and, feeling confidence in its integrity,&#xD;
with the calm demeanor of a gentleman he awaited&#xD;
the decision of the court.&#xD;
Not so his opponent. His course was quite differ&#xD;
ent. Every species of chicanery and fraud,.no mat-&#xD;
ter how brazen, was resorted to, provided only he&#xD;
kept clear of the meshes of the law. He had around&#xD;
him a set of sycophants of the most degraded char-&#xD;
acter, and these lie employed to serve as witnesses&#xD;
and swear the exact reverse of all that had been&#xD;
proved by the testimony of the other side. What&#xD;
was of still more importance, he had made himself&#xD;
a favorite with the Government for various little&#xD;
services rendered, more easily understood than ex-&#xD;
plained, so that he -counted on success as certain,&#xD;
as well he might under the circumstances. The&#xD;
trial came on ; and, after various motions and post-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
ponements, and finally changing the venue, and&#xD;
going through the whole form again in another&#xD;
county, was twice decided in Margin's favor. All&#xD;
the country people predicted this decision from the&#xD;
commencement, as they said-" Jab was never beat&#xD;
yet, no matter who was against him, for the devil'&#xD;
always takes-care of his own." Lord Wallingford,&#xD;
becoming disgusted with such low trickery, aban-&#xD;
doned the case, and would have no more to do with&#xD;
it.&#xD;
Now came the turning point. in old "Jab's" lile&#xD;
-the point for which lie had toiled and schemed&#xD;
and planned and robbed with an indomitable energy&#xD;
which should put to the blush those who are striving&#xD;
for an everlasting reward.. Few are the Christians&#xD;
indeed who work half so hard for the Eternal King'&#xD;
dom as this unfortunate wretch worked to gain a&#xD;
position for a few years in this perishable world.&#xD;
He allowed the pits to remain under water about&#xD;
six months longer to save appearances, and the&#xD;
amount of destitution and suffering in the mines&#xD;
was appalling. Hundreds emigrated to America,&#xD;
and hundreds more passed from the earth like shad-&#xD;
ows, worn out with typhus and various other appa-&#xD;
rent diseases, but in reality dying by inches from&#xD;
long suffering and hope deferred. Having at length&#xD;
&#xD;
satisfied himself that the mining company were&#xD;
pretty well tired of the mines, Margin laid before&#xD;
them a proposition: it was to rent the wvhole of the&#xD;
mines belonging to the company at a low estimate,&#xD;
in consideration of the great risk incurred-" which&#xD;
risk, however, he was willing to'undertake merely&#xD;
from a benevolent motive to give employment."&#xD;
Oat of every £1 which the pits produced he would&#xD;
give them 2s. 6d., or one-eighth.&#xD;
After pondering on it for a while, and remember-&#xD;
ing the losses they had already sustained, they agreed&#xD;
to the proposal. A magnificent engine, which .cost&#xD;
the company over £3,000, and had long been lying&#xD;
there apparently useless, he purchased from them&#xD;
for £800. To work he went now, and soon the&#xD;
water disappeared from the pits. Men, horses and&#xD;
machinery toiled night and day, and untold wealth&#xD;
was brought up from the bowels of the earth.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIIL&#xD;
Tms Margin had a wife the very reverse of him-&#xD;
self. A more kind-hearted being never breathed the&#xD;
breath of life, or one more full of sympathy for the&#xD;
suffering poor. This good woman was ever on the&#xD;
watch when her husband's back was turned to see&#xD;
what amount of relief she could distribute. Often&#xD;
would she hide away in a closet the wife of some&#xD;
poor cottier on Jab's unexpected return, and on let-&#xD;
ting her out through the back gate she would slip a&#xD;
fine cut of bacon under her cloak, in addition to the&#xD;
well-filled bag of meal slung across her shoulder.&#xD;
The fiercer the wind blew or the more incessant the&#xD;
down-pouring rain, the more surely was the excel-&#xD;
lent Mrs. Margin to be seen' straining her eyes&#xD;
through the window-panes, and ever and anon dart-&#xD;
ing out in the storm to look up and down the road,&#xD;
hoping to catch a glimpse of her dear poor, and&#xD;
most lovingly would she take the shivering hands&#xD;
and lead the drenched forms to the warm kitchen&#xD;
hearth.&#xD;
It is said there is an angel in every house, and&#xD;
&#xD;
most assuredly there was .for a time an angel of&#xD;
mercy under the roof-tree of this incorrigible villain.&#xD;
Many a half-uttered curse was stifled on the lips of&#xD;
the goaded peasantry when they remembered this&#xD;
gentle being.&#xD;
At a subsequent period, when the people, driven&#xD;
to distraction, formed a secret society, old "Jab"&#xD;
was tried by one of their tribunals and condemned&#xD;
to die for his atrocious robberies and wholesale mur-&#xD;
ders of the poor.  A  silence for many minutes&#xD;
reigned in that rough assembly, until one gaunt-&#xD;
looking man, with a blackened face and hollow voice,&#xD;
proposed that the sentence should be reversed "for&#xD;
the sake of his wife, the best and kindest woman&#xD;
that ever lived." The motion passed unanimously,&#xD;
and the world was for a while longer cursed by the&#xD;
old miscreant. Margin had two sons and three&#xD;
daughters, nearly all like himself. Besides his own&#xD;
immediate family, he imported .a whole colony of&#xD;
nephews from his native county, whom he established&#xD;
in various branches of business. Two had general&#xD;
stores or shops in different ends of the mines where&#xD;
every article was kept, "from a needle to an anchor."&#xD;
Another was transformed into .a doctor, and imme-&#xD;
(liately installed in the county-dispensary at a good&#xD;
salary. Another established a mill. One of his&#xD;

&#xD;
sons he made a lawyer. The other, in conjunction&#xD;
rith one of his nephews, founded a " Loan Bank,"&#xD;
one of the greatest curses ever introduced into a&#xD;
country. This was ostensibly a great accomunoda-&#xD;
tion to the miners, as they, could borrow small sums,&#xD;
from one to ton pounds, with which they could buy&#xD;
a few loads of coal, and by the sale make a little&#xD;
profit to help in the support of their families. For&#xD;
this accommodation they paid twenty per cent.. in-&#xD;
terest, which was, of course, deducted from the&#xD;
principal before it was paid over. The payments&#xD;
were made by weekly installments, and should be all&#xD;
refunded in twenty weeks. If but one week was&#xD;
omitted there was a fine, and for three the whole&#xD;
was forfeited. Two solvent names besides the bor-&#xD;
rower's should be on the paper for security, and this&#xD;
document should be laid before the board for a week&#xD;
before the important question could be decided&#xD;
whether the poor, trembling applicant would be re-&#xD;
fused or not. Many a tine the little speculation&#xD;
turned out a failure, or at least did not become avail-&#xD;
able in time to meet the weekly payments, and then&#xD;
the poor wife might be seen trudging her weary way&#xD;
over the hills to the nearest post-town where there&#xD;
was a pawn-office, with her best blue cloak. Next&#xD;
hei husband's Sunday frize would go, then their&#xD;
&#xD;
poor bed-covering, until they were perfectly bare.&#xD;
The applicant should first apply-to the doctor, ma-&#xD;
king known the amount he required, the purpose&#xD;
for which he wanted it, the names of his securities,&#xD;
etc. If the doctor approved, he would then sign the&#xD;
application, and lay it before the board. They&#xD;
could afterward accept or reject it as they pleased.&#xD;
For this small act of courtesy the doctor demand-&#xD;
ed pay-not directly, but indirectly. For instance,&#xD;
he would make it his business to ride past the cabin&#xD;
of such applicant on his way home from the dispen-&#xD;
sary, and if a clutch of young ducks, or chickens,&#xD;
or a couple of geese, happened to be waddling round,&#xD;
he would call out the poor woman and order them&#xD;
to be sent to his house, stating that he would set-&#xD;
tle for them with her husband. Woe betide her,&#xD;
however, if she dared ever to remind him of the&#xD;
debt; for her husband or her son would be turned&#xD;
out of the uncle's employment, or their wages cut&#xD;
down, or some species of paltry revenge taken. A&#xD;
few such examples effectually silenced all demands&#xD;
for payment for poultry. The only course left was&#xD;
to hide them ; and many a half-naked little boy&#xD;
with bleached hair standing erect as a stubble field,&#xD;
would be perched on a ditch, from which a view&#xD;
of the dispensary could be obtained, watching the&#xD;

door to see which way the doctor's horse would turn,&#xD;
If seen approaching, the poor little urchin would $y&#xD;
like the wind to warn his mother, and ducks, tur-&#xD;
keys and all would be driven into the cabin and&#xD;
the door shut, to make believe there was no one in..&#xD;
All the cottiers, miners, laborers, etc., received their&#xD;
pay in orders on the shops, where every article was&#xD;
kept which they could possibly need-of course at&#xD;
a good profit. It was with gieat difficulty they&#xD;
could prevail upon their task-masters to give them&#xD;
a little money at Christmas and Easter to pay their,&#xD;
dues for the support of their clergy. It was a reg-&#xD;
ular habit of the whole Margin tribe to meet at&#xD;
"Jab's" house at stated periods and take counsel&#xD;
together. Each one would then report progress;&#xD;
and if there was a farm that one of them coveted, or&#xD;
a poor cabin formed an eyesore to the landscape&#xD;
from their residences, or any other such trifle&#xD;
stood in their way, all would put their wicked wits&#xD;
to work to find out how they could circumvent the&#xD;
occupiers of such farm or cabin, and then become&#xD;
the owners themselves. Knowing the importance&#xD;
of having a friend in high places, it was their con-&#xD;
stant study to curry favor with the British Govern-&#xD;
ment by denouncing the disaffected, and every other&#xD;
means in their power-a task not at all difficult&#xD;
&#xD;
among a people goaded to madness, and who were&#xD;
often driven to crime from sheer desperation. Thus&#xD;
the Margin family\ became literally the autocrats&#xD;
of that immense district, so rich in mineral wealth,&#xD;
and the mass of the people held their very existence by&#xD;
the breath of those merciless wretches. Many an&#xD;
unfortunate "small" farmer whose well-tilled fields&#xD;
they coveted, was, by a series of petty persecutions,&#xD;
induced to join the brigade of Captain Starlight, or&#xD;
some other illegal association. His footsteps were&#xD;
dogged by night and day, until he was finally de-&#xD;
nounced by some of the Margin crew to the minions&#xD;
of the law, and sent to languish out ten or fourteen&#xD;
years in penal servitude, in all probability never&#xD;
more to behold " friends and sacred homes."&#xD;
As soon as the excitement cooled down, Margin,&#xD;
by some contrivance, would get hold of the cov-&#xD;
eted fields, and the broken-hearted wife and children&#xD;
would be sent to the road; or worse-the workhouse.&#xD;
One well-remembered circumstance will serve as au&#xD;
illustration for many, many similar ones. A poor,&#xD;
wretched man had been denounced in the way above&#xD;
mentioned and transported. He had never been&#xD;
more than an humble cottier who worked with the&#xD;
neighboring farmers, and who, before and after&#xD;
hours, tried to till one little potato field. behind his&#xD;

&#xD;
cabin. The miserable cabin and poor potato patch&#xD;
were, however, painfully visible from Margin's par.&#xD;
for windows, and every expedient was resorted to&#xD;
in order to get possession of them. This poor man's&#xD;
father and grandfather before him had been cottiers,&#xD;
and contentedly tilled the same field and inhabited&#xD;
the same cabin. It was the only home he ever knew,&#xD;
and he loved it as dearly as the rich man loves his&#xD;
ancestral halls; perhaps more dearly, for it was all&#xD;
the world to him. Here he was born ; here he was&#xD;
married ; and here his seven little ones first saw the&#xD;
light. Margin tried to )urehase it, but he would&#xD;
not sell. He then coaxed, wheedled, threatened-all&#xD;
in vain. Thereupon "Jab"  commenced to perse-&#xD;
cute, and a series of petty annoyances-each of&#xD;
which would take a volunie to describe-were set&#xD;
to work, until the unfortunate creature was driven&#xD;
to join an illegal society, then in full operation in&#xD;
the neighborhood, and which promised him redress.&#xD;
His was the very voice that begged Margin's;life&#xD;
might be ,spared " for his good wife's sake," while&#xD;
the wretched old villain was tracking his footsteps&#xD;
like a blood-hound. The unfortunate man was dis.&#xD;
covered with illegal papers on his person, and Margin&#xD;
on the trial represented him as a very lawless char.&#xD;
acter and a disturber of the public peace. He was&#xD;
&#xD;
therefore, of course, sentenced to serve for ten years&#xD;
beyond the seas.&#xD;
Immediately after his departure a great council&#xD;
of the Margin tribe was held, and the subject under&#xD;
discussion was how to get this cabin out of sight.&#xD;
It might be done eventually by the power of the&#xD;
law, but it would take time; and, as one of the&#xD;
nephews was ab  t to make a very wealthy match,&#xD;
it was quite indispensable to have such an unsightly&#xD;
object removed before the wedding took place. The&#xD;
doctor proposed to take forcible possession, knock it&#xD;
down, and let the wife then go to lawif 8 lecould-&#xD;
a contingency which her povei'ty made impossible.&#xD;
This proposition was received with great favor&#xD;
and agreed to be acted upon, but old "Jab" recomin&#xD;
mended that some weeks slrould be allowed to&#xD;
elapse until some fresh calamity had abated the&#xD;
public sympathy for this worse than widow and her&#xD;
orphans ; and for this purpose it would be necessary&#xD;
to create a kind of panic. Accordingly a false re-&#xD;
port was spread one morning, about a nontli later,&#xD;
that Margin's farm-house and mill had been entered&#xD;
and robbed the night before. Many names were&#xD;
mentioned as being suspected, and all were in con-&#xD;
sternation, for the ukase had gone forth that he&#xD;
would stop all the works for a month if the robbers&#xD;

&#xD;
could not be found-and stopping the employment&#xD;
was the same as a sentence of death to hundreds.&#xD;
Everybody, therefore, was perplexed how to act, and&#xD;
was trembling for his own fate. In the midst of the&#xD;
general confusion a set of strange men, unknown in&#xD;
that part of the country, came from Margin's faru&#xD;
with picks and crowbars to the coveted cabin, and,&#xD;
coolly handing out the wretched furniture, finally&#xD;
dragged out the unfortunate wife and her seven&#xD;
children into the road, pulled off the thatch, broke&#xD;
down the walls, quenched the fire on the hearth,&#xD;
and demolished every vestige of their home; for,&#xD;
however humble, it was ome, after all, and around&#xD;
it their fondest affections were entwined.&#xD;
Doctor Margin presided in person over this inhu-&#xD;
man transaction-done, too, without even the sem-&#xD;
blance of a vile law to sustain it. Calling her&#xD;
desolate children round her this heart-broken poor&#xD;
woman knelt down,.and, throwing her arms up to&#xD;
heaven, while tears rained down her cheeks, prayed&#xD;
that the wrath of an angry God might descend upon&#xD;
every member of the Margin family-except the one&#xD;
of whom he was not worthy-that they might be&#xD;
accursed both in this world and the world to come!&#xD;
It was a terrible scene. Arising, she shook the&#xD;
dust from her feet, and, casting one last look on the&#xD;

heap of ruins she loved so well, she and her misera-&#xD;
ble little flock took their way with cries and sobs to&#xD;
the house of the parish priest.&#xD;
The good pastor brought them to his fireside, gave&#xD;
them all the consolation he could, and what tempo-&#xD;
rary relief was in his power. When she told him&#xD;
the curse she had pronounced upon the Margins, he&#xD;
shook his head sorrowfully, and said'he regretted&#xD;
shelhad committed such a sin.&#xD;
" Father, honey! don't say another word to me!"&#xD;
exclaimed the bereaved creature. " I don't believe&#xD;
that the good and marciful God will ever lay it upon&#xD;
my sowl; because my heart was blistered and He saw&#xD;
it-my good God saw it-and he knows that the&#xD;
same breed tore the father from my poor childer,&#xD;
and I tried to bear it and never cursed them then.&#xD;
But when they tore down my poor cabin, and put out&#xD;
the fire where I had warmed many a desolate cray-&#xD;
thur for His sake, and when my heart-broken or-&#xD;
,  phans were turned upon the cowld road, I should&#xD;
spake or I'd bust; and I know my blessed Father&#xD;
in heaven will hear my prayer and will never have&#xD;
it afore my sowl. I didn't do it to offind him. Oh,&#xD;
God forbid!" And the poor soul burst into a pas&#xD;
sionate flood of grief.*&#xD;

Mr. Jacob Margin made a smiling garden. where&#xD;
this poor home once stood, and beautiful flowers of&#xD;
brilliant hue exhaled their fragrance and opened&#xD;
their petals to the sun, and the birds came there and&#xD;
sang their little hymns of praise, never knowing the&#xD;
bitter sorrow that had wrung burning curses on that&#xD;
very spot from a heart seared with human agony--&#xD;
curses which arose from that broken heart to the&#xD;
throne of the Most High, and which will assuredly,&#xD;
in God's own good time, bear fruit. A few months&#xD;
later it was gazetted that " Mr. Jacob Margin had&#xD;
been appointed to the commission of the peace, his&#xD;
excellency the lord lieutenant having no doubt lie&#xD;
would make an energetic and efficient magistrate,"&#xD;
and thus the low-born wretch became Jacob Mar-&#xD;
gin, Esq., J. P.&#xD;
God help poor Ireland!&#xD;
I would here apologize to my readers for introdne&#xD;
ing Mr. Margin to their notice. I am painfully&#xD;
sensible he is not by any means a respectable ac-.&#xD;
quaintance. But as we pass through life we must&#xD;
brush against villains sometimes; and as the -man&#xD;
lived and figured in many of the sad events recorded&#xD;
in these pages, it is necessary he should be known&#xD;
and his character understood, especially as his&#xD;
nephews and sons are still living, and enjoying the&#xD;
&#xD;
fruits of his knavery. Many a one now in exile&#xD;
through his means, and many who have, tliank God !&#xD;
outlived his treachery, will recognize the portrait.&#xD;
Again I say, God help poor Ireland! and God&#xD;
comfort her oppressed people I&#xD;
In the long catalogue of the robberies committed&#xD;
upon them by English law-or by Government fa-&#xD;
vorites without any law-there is none so much to&#xD;
be deplored as robbing them of their independent&#xD;
spirit. It is galling to the soul to see them, hat in&#xD;
hand, craving as a boon what the meanest serfs is&#xD;
Europe receive as a right-namely, a livelihood out&#xD;
of the soil on which God has placed them. But it is&#xD;
a thousand times more galling to hear those who&#xD;
ought to know better condemning them for so doing.&#xD;
They cainot help it. Their very lives and the lives&#xD;
of their little ones depend upon their submission to&#xD;
the great man of the district-most frequently a&#xD;
miserable upstart, inferior to themselves in every-&#xD;
thing but wealth. Many farmers who hold large&#xD;
farms of fine productive land, and who often have&#xD;
money in bank, are afraid to ride a good horse or&#xD;
allow their wives or daughters to appear much bet-&#xD;
ter dressed than their poor neighbors lest it should&#xD;
be suspected they had money, for a raise in the rent&#xD;
would surely be the consequence.&#xD;

The poor cottiers tremble to. be discovered with a&#xD;
flock of geese or turkeys, or a litter of young pigs.&#xD;
We have seen from the acts of Doctor Margin how&#xD;
necessary it is to hide them away (unfortunately he&#xD;
has many imitators), and thus the practice of dissim-&#xD;
ulation is early implanted. Falsehood belongs to&#xD;
the whole system of British rule in Ireland, and is&#xD;
perfectly inseparable from the odious and infamous&#xD;
laws relating to land tenures. Prevarications are&#xD;
essential to the existence of the peasantry under the&#xD;
present order of things. Let those, therefore, who&#xD;
condemn them see if they be not guilty themselves&#xD;
before they cast the first stone at the wronged and&#xD;
friendless poor; and when they hear of some outrage&#xD;
committed by the " Whiteboys," or some such ille-&#xD;
gal association, let them pause before pronouncing&#xD;
their eloquent denunciations, remembering the in-&#xD;
tolerable burdens and foul oppressions heaped on the&#xD;
people.&#xD;
I am not the advocate of secret societies, nor do I&#xD;
believe there is much good affected by them; but it&#xD;
would be well if those who pass such severe judg-&#xD;
ment on their members would bear in mind that the&#xD;
provocations of the Irish peasant are beyond human&#xD;
endurance, and quite sufficient to excuse his seeking&#xD;
redress after any fashion, or to palliate any excess&#xD;
&#xD;
he might commit. They should further bear in&#xD;
mind that no other people under heaven could pass&#xD;
through such a terrible ordeal for centuries, and&#xD;
come out of it with so many shining virtues untarP&#xD;
ished.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIS'.&#xD;
THE grief and consternation of the Glengoulah&#xD;
tenantry was indescribable when they heard that&#xD;
Margin had been appointed agent. They knew not&#xD;
what it was to be servile, for they had always been&#xD;
accustomed to being treated by Mr. De Courcy as&#xD;
human beings, whose feelings were worthy of con-&#xD;
sideration and respect. It therefore took a Dong&#xD;
time and a well-planned series of persecutions to&#xD;
bring even a portion of them under subjection, while&#xD;
others were driven into rebellion, many of whom&#xD;
were formerly remarkable for their orderly, peacea-&#xD;
ble dispositions. Margin purchased a small estate&#xD;
as near as' possible to Glengoulah Castle, and built&#xD;
a fine house upon it, to which he subsequently re-&#xD;
moved.&#xD;
About this time his eldest son, the lawyer-the&#xD;
only one of her children who possessed anything&#xD;
like the heart of his mother-was drowned by the&#xD;
upsetting of a little gig in which he had been taking&#xD;
a pleasure sail on the beautiful Ovoca. The sight&#xD;
of the dead body of her firstborn and favorite son&#xD;
&#xD;
preyed upon the mind of the kind and amiable Mrs.&#xD;
Margin, and she did not-long survive the blow.&#xD;
It is beautifully said, no matter how a man may&#xD;
be debased by sin, he still has some one redeeming&#xD;
trait to show the Divine hand that formed him; " as&#xD;
in a ruined temple, after long searching among the&#xD;
rubbish, one may discover some broken arch or ren.&#xD;
nant of a once finely-chased capital to mark the fin-&#xD;
ished genius of the architect."~* So it was with&#xD;
this most avaricious old sinner. He had one redeem&#xD;
ing trait, one green spot in the arid desert of his&#xD;
withered heart. It was a great love for his wife and&#xD;
respect for her virtues, which he would never tire ex-&#xD;
tolling, but would not try to imitate. He mourned&#xD;
her long and sincerely; but sorrow, which purifies&#xD;
most natures, seemed only to stir to its depths the&#xD;
bitterness of his accrimonions disposition. He was a&#xD;
tyrant by nature, and since the only virtuous thing;lhe&#xD;
ever loved was taken from him, he devoted all his&#xD;
energies to the acquisition of his idols-wealth and&#xD;
power.&#xD;
It is unnecessary to enter into the details of his&#xD;
petty, systematic persecutions, nor would the history&#xD;
be at all edifying. It will be enough to mention&#xD;
that when four years had passed there was a visible&#xD;

&#xD;
change both in the farm-houses and the people of&#xD;
Glengoulah. The rents had been increased again and&#xD;
again, until nearly all their hard earnings went into&#xD;
the pocket of the landlord. Then came the agent's&#xD;
" duty work," which means that all the tenants and&#xD;
their laborers are expected to devote some days, turn&#xD;
about, during the season, to tilling his farm free of&#xD;
cost, under pain of his eternal enmity. Add to these&#xD;
troubles the uncertainty of being left in possession&#xD;
after meeting every demand, and wonder no longer&#xD;
that gates were seen hanging by one hinge, cattle&#xD;
roaming at will or grazing in the ditches, pigs and&#xD;
poultry tresspassing upon neighbors, thereby causing&#xD;
disputes and often lawsuits; the cattle pens looking&#xD;
shabby, and the whole byre, once so trim and well-&#xD;
kept, dirty and miry, the poor vines and flower-beds&#xD;
drooping and running wild, the very smoke seeming&#xD;
not to curl up as of old in graceful spiral wreaths,&#xD;
but coming out one time in a sullen gust of indig-&#xD;
nation, and at another lazily mounting but a little&#xD;
way, and falling back again on the roof of the farm-&#xD;
house with a sad, disconsolate air. The landscape,&#xD;
however, lost nothing of its beauty, for the hand of&#xD;
God had piled the beautiful hills peak over peak,&#xD;
and clothed them with the most exquisite variety of&#xD;
shrubs and trees, and the slopes He covered with the&#xD;
&#xD;
softest and greenest of turf. Then he called out the&#xD;
starry buttercups and daisies to spangle it over, as&#xD;
the blue heavens were spangled at night with the&#xD;
myriad worlds of light; and He filled the groves.&#xD;
with bands of feathered musicians ; and He com-&#xD;
manded the crystal rills to run singing into the val&#xD;
leys, and the brooks, and the birds, and the flowers&#xD;
all obeyed. Him; apd, therefore, no amount of wick-&#xD;
edness on the part of man could mar the lovely pros-&#xD;
pect.&#xD;
Well, it is time, after this long digression, to see&#xD;
how Toney Byrne and his family fared in these al-&#xD;
tered times.&#xD;
Poor Toney has still the same industrious habits,&#xD;
the same confiding trust in Divine Providence,&#xD;
although there is a great change in his once happy&#xD;
homestead. And death, too, has visited him in the&#xD;
midst of his other cares. His youngest child, Pat-&#xD;
rick-" the very inott of himself," as his mother used&#xD;
to say-a gentle, good-humored, loving boy, was&#xD;
taken down with scarlet fever, as were Andy and&#xD;
Mike likewise, but the two latter recovered, and lit-&#xD;
tle Patrick went to play with the angels and bade&#xD;
adieu to sorrow for evermore. It was a sad trial&#xD;
upon his father and mother to 'part with this quiet,&#xD;
affectionate little fellow. It was the first child they&#xD;

ever buried, and their grief was great to see him&#xD;
die in the morning of life; but when the first&#xD;
great burst of sorrow had passed, they blessed God&#xD;
for securing their beloved boy a home in His own&#xD;
kingdom, far from the persecutions of their proselyt-&#xD;
izing landlord and .agent. Those three boys had&#xD;
unconsciously brought great trouble to their parents,&#xD;
for they had been continually harassed by messages.&#xD;
from the landlord earnestly requesting they should&#xD;
be sent to the school designed for them. Toney&#xD;
mildly but firmly refused to send them, alleging&#xD;
"he wanted the eldest boy at home to help him on&#xD;
the farm-the only time he could spare for learning&#xD;
being at night; and as a master came to teach him,&#xD;
why, they might as well all learn together."&#xD;
Nothing daunted, the Bible-reader of his reve-&#xD;
ence came again to request the two younger ones&#xD;
might be sent.&#xD;
Not wishing to exasperate his tyrant, poor Toney&#xD;
said "his second eldest boy was inclined to be frol-&#xD;
icsome, and he tried to keep him from other boys as&#xD;
much as possible. He would only be a source of&#xD;
trouble in the school, and he did not wish to let him&#xD;
from under his own eye."&#xD;
A third message came -and this time it was&#xD;
borne by Miss Biggs herself; in her carriage.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Her reverend brother had sent to request the&#xD;
youngest boy to come to school the following Monday&#xD;
morning, as he understood he possessed a very mild&#xD;
-temper."  Toney was eating his dinner when she&#xD;
swept in awful grandeur into the farmer's kitchen.&#xD;
He told her ".his little boy had never been absent&#xD;
from home without some member of his family; and,&#xD;
being. of a very timid disposition, he would fret and&#xD;
pine among strangers.&#xD;
Miss Biggs was very eloquent, and consumed with&#xD;
zeal; Toney Byrne very mild, but determined. All&#xD;
she could get out of him was, that he would wait&#xD;
until the boy-grew older before he would send him&#xD;
to school; and he bowed the lady very respectfully&#xD;
into her carriage.&#xD;
Toney had expressly forbidden Kitty to hold any&#xD;
conversation with those Bible-readers, or any of the&#xD;
Biggs messengers, knowing she would not be able&#xD;
to keep her temper, and would do no good by losing&#xD;
it. Therefore, when they called in his absence,&#xD;
Kitty told them she would tell her husband and let&#xD;
him do as he pleased. Some tried to engage her in&#xD;
a controversy, but she resolutely kept very busy&#xD;
always, and did not remain a moment in the room.&#xD;
. About a year or two after this, just as: school&#xD;
opened one vacation, the three boys took the scarlet&#xD;

&#xD;
fever, and the youngest died as we have seen-: " a&#xD;
just judgment upon his parents," the Bible-readers&#xD;
and the Misses Biggs said, "for keeping him from&#xD;
the knowledge of the Lord."&#xD;
His Christian parents took a very different view,&#xD;
however, of his removal. They deemed it a mark&#xD;
of the tenderest love of their dear Father in Heaven&#xD;
to take the gentle child to His bosom, and thus de-&#xD;
prive the voracious Biggs of a prey he intended to&#xD;
devour. There was now no fear of his claiming&#xD;
Mike for a pupil, for some months at least, as the&#xD;
minister and his family, like all of their class, had a&#xD;
mortal dread of contagion. So Toney enjoyed about&#xD;
six months' peace.&#xD;
Winnie still contrived to trail the vines and tend&#xD;
the flowers as of old, for the sake of good Mr. De&#xD;
Courcy, whose gift they were-therefore the farm.&#xD;
house, in its exterior, looked less changed than most&#xD;
others, but many of its interior comforts were gone.&#xD;
The kitchen roof no longer contained its weighty&#xD;
drapery of flitches of bacon, nor were the bins filled&#xD;
with oatmeal as in former days. Poverty was be.&#xD;
coming an inmate where none of God's poor were&#xD;
ever denied relief. But no murmurs nor complaints&#xD;
were heard. Cheerfulness and hospitality still had&#xD;
a shelter around the blazing turf pile, and tales and&#xD;
&#xD;
songs wat round; but often the subjects under dis-&#xD;
cussion took a gloomier character than was their&#xD;
wont, and men talked with flashing eyes of the vast&#xD;
change wrought in. Glengoulah since Sir Charles&#xD;
died, but especially since old Margin became agent.&#xD;
The bare mention of the agent's name brought&#xD;
curses to their lips, which were but half uttered&#xD;
when a reproof from Toney stopped them: "Boys,&#xD;
boys, honey! take care what you're saying' now--&#xD;
don't be sinnin' your souls with hiin--lave him to&#xD;
God; he can't be worse nor he is, and all your hard&#xD;
words wont make him any better."&#xD;
"Bter eneaghi! Be my sowl, he'll be better when&#xD;
the divil has him, but not till thin."&#xD;
"Well, it can't be very long till that time comes,&#xD;
anyway. Sure the divil has a heavy mortgage on&#xD;
his sowl, and he'll pretty soon be lookin' for his own,&#xD;
plaze the pigs."&#xD;
"Och ! That he may take him body and bones&#xD;
wid all my heart. Don't be shakin' your head at&#xD;
me now, Mr. Byrne; throth its sorry I am that cur-&#xD;
Pin' is a sin, for its fine, manly talk."&#xD;
"Well, purshume to you! Out of my sight, Toni&#xD;
Moody ; you'd make a dog laugh, so you would.&#xD;
Isn't it to pity the unfortunate wretch ye ought ?&#xD;
I'm sure, wid all his riches, not one of us would swap&#xD;

now?)"&#xD;
"Is it to swap with old Jab?  Oh, no! Faix, if&#xD;
we have empty pockets, we have light heels and&#xD;
sound ones too, the- Lord be praised!"&#xD;
This was in allusion to a running sore of long&#xD;
standing which obliged Jab always to appear astride&#xD;
a little, stout-built, black pony, which same animal&#xD;
was often earnestly recommended by passing pedes-&#xD;
trians to stumble and break its master's neck-a re-&#xD;
commendation, however, the sure-footed little animal&#xD;
heard in dignified silence.&#xD;
"Well, lie can't have very long to run now, him-&#xD;
self or his ould leg; let him do his best. There wont&#xD;
be many breakin' hearts after he goes, that's one&#xD;
comfort."&#xD;
" Be dad, your right there, Peter; for he'll break&#xD;
them all afore he goes,I'm thinkin'."&#xD;
This last remark was made by Bryan 'Dempsey,&#xD;
the young farmer who evinced so much sympathy&#xD;
for Toney Byrne the day Mr. De Courcy announced&#xD;
so unwillingly the first increase in the rents, and&#xD;
the landlord's refusal to sign the leases. Little did.&#xD;
poor Bryan dream how very prophetic his words&#xD;
were, as far as concerned him and all he loved most&#xD;
&#xD;
dearly. He had become a constant visitor at Toney's&#xD;
farm-house ever since that day, and had endeared&#xD;
himself to every one in the house by his efforts tc&#xD;
make them forget their sorrows.&#xD;
At this present time, however, since the truth&#xD;
must be told, he had a little personal interest to for-&#xD;
ward there too, for his heart had been attracted to the&#xD;
joyous nature of the pretty, blooming Winnie, now&#xD;
emerging into womanhood.    Somehow or other,&#xD;
whatever way it happened, Bryan too had become&#xD;
dearer to Winnie than all the world besides. No&#xD;
doubt it was all because of his great respect for her&#xD;
father. Of course she -would not acknowledge such&#xD;
a weakness for any consideration, and was always&#xD;
ready to repel with indignation such a very foolish&#xD;
charge. Nevertheless, a close observer might easily&#xD;
detect how her ear quickened when his visiting hour&#xD;
came in the evening; how her cheeks flushed when&#xD;
a step cane into the little porch and the latch was&#xD;
raised ; how her heart " fell down into.her shoes "&#xD;
when some other head-Tom Moody's for instance--&#xD;
appeared with its "God save all here ;" how she&#xD;
tossed her head, looked at the fire, gave a very un-&#xD;
necessary jerk to her spinning-wheel, and had hard-&#xD;
ly a civil word for poor Tom, who, taking a seat bey&#xD;
side her, tried his very best to be entertaining ; how&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC7337-00000097"/>&#xD;
another step, and the right head this time, made her&#xD;
pure blood mount to the temples, and how very sud-&#xD;
denly she became all attention to Tom's narrative,-&#xD;
laughing at his jokes, and asking him many ques-&#xD;
tions, being very careful meantime to avoid the&#xD;
particular spot where Bryan sat.&#xD;
Yes, indeed, to any observer who knew anything&#xD;
of that mysterious fountain of truest human affec-&#xD;
tion-a woman's Ieart-it was very plain that the&#xD;
teasing,laughter-loving singing-bird of the hills was&#xD;
caged at last. Accordingly,.after a little show of&#xD;
resistance on Winnie's part, and many an anxious&#xD;
sigh on the part of Toney, who- would fair have seen&#xD;
Bryan's affairs in a more flourishing condition for&#xD;
the sake of his favorite child, as well as for the sake&#xD;
of her brave young suitor whom he loved as a son,&#xD;
Bryan and Winnie were married.&#xD;
Toney had long since surrendered all hope of leases&#xD;
ever being given by the parson, but he trusted that,&#xD;
seeing how peaceable and industrious they all were,&#xD;
he would leave them in undisturbed possession.&#xD;
Mrs. Byrne, although she owned Bryan Dempsey&#xD;
to be a great pet of hers, made divers moans at the&#xD;
idea of parting with her only daughter; and al-&#xD;
though the whitewashed farm-house of Bryan could&#xD;
be distinctly seen about a mile up the hill peeping&#xD;
&#xD;
through the trees from the .spot where Mrs. Byrne&#xD;
so often sat spinning, yet she shook her fist at Bryan&#xD;
and called him a "hard-hearted, cruel boy to rob&#xD;
her of her only daughter, her last remaining com&#xD;
fort. She might now sit alone and spin, and who&#xD;
would she have to talk to ? Sure all the world and&#xD;
his wife knew boys were not fit companions for a&#xD;
mother," etc., etc.&#xD;
But the wedding took place nevertheless, and a&#xD;
very pleasant wedding it was too, in spite of their&#xD;
altered circumstances. Nor did the guests find&#xD;
much difference in the quality or quantity of the&#xD;
viands from the' memorable occasion six years before&#xD;

hanging by the. heels at the end of the hose, while&#xD;
the perseverance with which the smaller poultry&#xD;
struggled and begged for life was worthy of a better&#xD;

whole sheep and a side of beef were found in con-&#xD;
coaled parts of the market-wagon on a close inspec-&#xD;

ever remain a secret to outsiders; So&#xD;
All went merry as a marriage bell."&#xD;
Darby Wholahan was there sporting bran new&#xD;
pipes for the occasion, rolling his sightless orbs and&#xD;
making all sorts of grimaces for the amusement&#xD;
of the junior Donohoes and sundry other youngsters&#xD;
who were never done admiring the squeezing of&#xD;
that merry bag of wind, diving every half minute&#xD;
underneath on an exploring expedition to see where&#xD;
the music came from, and always going off in an&#xD;
ecstasy of delight when Darby would make it squeak&#xD;
like a young pig. Alh, but the jigs and reels ! You&#xD;
should have been there to see, for my pen fails. " The&#xD;

joys must end ; and so the happy wedding-party of&#xD;
Winnie and Bryan was broken up, when, at the dawn&#xD;

couple at the door of the white farmhouse that&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
A FEW years passed away, the Protestant bishop&#xD;
of the diocese died, and the Rev. Samuel Wilson&#xD;
Biggs was appointed his successor in the Episcopal&#xD;
dignity. It was considered good news by the ten-&#xD;
antry on the Glengoulah estate, for they hoped lie&#xD;
would remove to the Episcopal palace, where his&#xD;
predecessors always resided, but they were doomed&#xD;
to disappointment.&#xD;
His newly-created lordship declared it was his in-&#xD;
tention to reside permanently at Glengoulah Castle.&#xD;
"lIe could not think," he said, " of abandoning the&#xD;
Lord's pasturage, now that new sheep were daily&#xD;
flocking to feed upon the fatness thereof."&#xD;
The solution of this mystery was that the storm&#xD;
so long threatening was now about to burst. Noti-&#xD;
ces to quit were served upon every one of the ten-&#xD;
ants whose leases had expired; and though they did&#xD;
not owe one farthing of rent, yet were they all to&#xD;
be ejected from the homes occupied by so many&#xD;
generations of their ancestors. Grief and conster-&#xD;
nation dwelt in every house. Where were thiey.to&#xD;
turn to? What was to become of their children !&#xD;
&#xD;
On the townland of Drinimure the tenantry held&#xD;
a meeting among- themselves, and discussed the&#xD;
question: "Should their children be sacrificed ?"&#xD;
Fear unhappily prevailed over their better judg-&#xD;
ment, and the agreement come to was that the chil-&#xD;
dren should be given up. The next day the bailiffs&#xD;
caine amid the loud and prolonged lamentations of&#xD;
the parents, many mothers tearing their hair and&#xD;
throwing themselves frantically on the earth The&#xD;
children were given up, and no more was heard of&#xD;
the ejectment on that townland,* with one excep-&#xD;
tion. No one knew better than his lordship how,&#xD;
for this dereliction of duty, those unfortunate crea-&#xD;
tures were racked by the bitterest remorse- of con-&#xD;
science; and were, of course, most justly excluded&#xD;
by their pastor from  partaking of the holy sacra-&#xD;
ments. Little lie cared for the pangs lie caused the&#xD;
poor-his paramount determination was to crush&#xD;
the benign influence of the true faith, and to destroy&#xD;
the affection existing between, the people and their&#xD;
pastors. Senseless wretch! As well might lie try to&#xD;
prevent the green moss from clinging to the change-&#xD;
less rock which supports it, and which it beautifies&#xD;
by its dependent love.&#xD;
I have said there was one exception on the town.&#xD;

land of Drinimure, which I must relate. A main&#xD;
named Cormac held a fine, farm on that townland,&#xD;
and his ancestors before him for more than two hun.&#xD;
dred years! He was a man proudof his ancient&#xD;
race, whose spirit chafed against these petty transac-&#xD;
tions. The accession of Biggs to the estate made&#xD;
him rear and plunge like a war-horse, but the ap-&#xD;
pointment of Margin to the agency broke his heart.&#xD;
Every time they came in contact they openly quar-&#xD;
relled, for Cormac never could brook Margin's inso'&#xD;
lent sneering manner. Happily for poor Cormac,&#xD;
before the expiration of Margin's first year of office&#xD;
he died, commending his widow and only child to&#xD;
God. Mrs. Cormnac was a woman of high spirit,&#xD;
and she bravely toiled to keep herself and child in&#xD;
respectability, although the frequent raisins of her&#xD;
rent made it a difficult matter to perform. Her lit-&#xD;
tie daughter, Norah, was a sweet child, and, went&#xD;
regularly every day to the convent-school of Ard-&#xD;
more, a distance of six miles. Being a talented,&#xD;
amiable child, she was much beloved by the nuns.&#xD;
She had a fine voice, and they taught her to sing&#xD;
many beautiful hymns, and often accepted her ser-&#xD;
vices in their choir on festive occasions.&#xD;
Judge the feelings of this widowed mother when&#xD;
bhe was called upon for the last time to resign her&#xD;
&#xD;
loved and carefully-instructed child, now about four-&#xD;
teen years old, to the care of the Misses Biggs, or&#xD;
give up the time-honored home of the Cormacs for-&#xD;
ever and become an outcast on the bounty of stran-&#xD;
gers. Fancy may imagine but no pen could por-&#xD;
tray the anguish of that mother's heart. Though a&#xD;
young woman, her hair became blanched, and many&#xD;
an hour in the dead of night she would kneel at the&#xD;
foot of a picture of the "Mater Dolorosa," where all&#xD;
the emblems of the sacred passion were represented,&#xD;
lying before the sinless Virgin; again, she would&#xD;
arise and pace the floor, moaning and wringing her&#xD;
hands. Ah, poor mother! who can blame you if&#xD;
for a brief space the tempter triumphed ! When&#xD;
the bailiffs entered the house, accompanied by a&#xD;
Bible-reader named Faulkner, Mrs. Cornac fixed&#xD;
her eyes upon them, glaring like a chained lioness ;&#xD;
her lips were compressed and her arms tightly&#xD;
crossed upon her bosom, as if to keep them from&#xD;
doing bodily harm to the wretches.&#xD;
Turning to her child she said, in a harsh, hurried&#xD;
voice, " Go with them, Norah !"&#xD;
Norah looked wildly at her mother for a moment,&#xD;
and then, uttering a piercing shriek, which never&#xD;
afterward left her mother's ears, she sped down the&#xD;
road like an arrow from a bow, and reaching the&#xD;

banks of the Ovoca fling herself into its now deep&#xD;
and rapid waters, for it was the month of November.&#xD;
Another of the tenants, named Fitzpatrick, who&#xD;
was coming up the road at the moment, saw time ac-&#xD;
tion, jumped in and saved her!*    He carried her&#xD;
out, and placed her living though senseless form. in&#xD;
the arms of her mother, who just reached the spot&#xD;
in a state of distraction. The neighbors helped&#xD;
both to their home.. After the application of re-&#xD;
storatives the little girl opened her eyes, and seeing&#xD;
her mother leaning over her, clasped her fondly-and&#xD;
looked lovingly in her face with a childish smile.&#xD;
The mother was consoled, and blessed God that she&#xD;
was restored to her. Poor soul! she did riot then&#xD;
know, what she soon learned, that the dear child&#xD;
though ever loving and gentle, was an idiot! The&#xD;
light of reason had fled those timid but ever smil-&#xD;
ing eyes. A few days afterward the Bible-reader&#xD;
called to demand the child again. Norah, shaking&#xD;
from head to foot, cowered behind her mother's&#xD;
chair like a terrified fawn. Mrs. Cormac, confront-&#xD;
ing Faulkner, exclaimed indignantly-&#xD;
Begone, Satan ! Tell your hell-hound of a mas=&#xD;
ter that I spit upon his notices, and defy his threats!"&#xD;

Seeing the unearthly light that shone in the out-&#xD;
raged woman's eyes, the sneakin    Bible-reader&#xD;
turned and fled.&#xD;
The following Sunday night the dwellings of the&#xD;
poor laborers in the town of Ardmore and its&#xD;
neighborhood were invaded by the emissaries of&#xD;
the sheriff, offering the sum of £2 to any man xwho&#xD;
would assist in the evictions. They met a blunt&#xD;
refusal in many places, notwithstanding the evident&#xD;
destitution under which the poor people were suffer-&#xD;
ing. In one instance a father and his son were&#xD;
offered £4; and another man with two sons was&#xD;
offered 26. Those who have seen the bitter poverty&#xD;
of the poor laborers in Ireland can justly estimated&#xD;
the fortitude and even heroism necessary to refuse&#xD;
such a temptation.&#xD;
When the recruiting general found he could not&#xD;
succeed he changed his tactics, representing that&#xD;
"they were only required at the castle for a day's&#xD;
little business."&#xD;
The poor wives of these men, on inquiry, discovered&#xD;
the artifice, and flung themselves on their knees be-&#xD;
fore their husbands, entreating them to reject the&#xD;
bribe. They declared they were satisfied to endure&#xD;
with patience the starvation they and their little&#xD;
ones were suffering, while they had a. shelter, even&#xD;

without fire, as they were that cold weather. The&#xD;
men were also offered with the bounty a strong es-&#xD;
cort of police from the outside of the town until&#xD;
they would return at night, and were told they&#xD;
would be flanked by two divisions of her majesty's&#xD;
20th regiment, with loaded muskets, and screwed&#xD;
bayonets, while they were levelling the houses. The&#xD;
poor fellows said it was not the dread of man that&#xD;
deterred them, but the fear of God, and that they&#xD;
had already too many proofs of the desolation brought&#xD;
on by the accursed crowbarismin the neighborhood.*&#xD;
After some delay his lordship procured ten men,&#xD;
the offscouringsof the lanes and alleys of Dublin,&#xD;
to be imported for the work of desolation. On the&#xD;
26th of November the rain fell in torrents, when&#xD;
there passed through the town of Tinmanogue a.&#xD;
body of two hundred mounted constabulary, a troop&#xD;
of infantry, a troop of dragoons, and two pieces of&#xD;
artillery, on their way to the townland of Drinimure&#xD;
to evict therefrom the only evil-disposed tenant on&#xD;
that part of the estate, widow Cormac and her idiot&#xD;
child.&#xD;
The poor woman had had a succession of fainting&#xD;
fits from the time she discovered her beloved and&#xD;
only child was bereft of reason, and now lay very&#xD;

ill. Every exertion had been made by Father&#xD;
O'Tool (who was a kinsman. of her late husband),&#xD;
and by Father Esmond, to have this virtuous and&#xD;
injured woman left in her home; but the rev-&#xD;
erend lord was inexorable. A widow. lady who&#xD;
lived a mile or two from this place, but who hap-&#xD;
pily was a tenant to the Dublin Mining Company,&#xD;
brought a car with a feather-bed, protected as far as&#xD;
possible from the incessant down-pour, and placed&#xD;
upon it the dying woman and her idiot daughter.&#xD;
She carried them to her home, and tended them&#xD;
carefully and lovingly as became a Christian, for&#xD;
which may God forever bless her.&#xD;
Besides the military and police present to over-&#xD;
awe tlie just indignation of an outraged people,&#xD;
Margin was there on his black pony, and his right-&#xD;
hand nian, Faulkner, the Bible-reader. A fiendish&#xD;
grin seemed to lurk around the mouths of. the&#xD;
vile pair, upon perceiving which Mrs. Dargain, the&#xD;
widow lady above referred to, walked up to Margin&#xD;
and told him whatever might be the fate of Mrs.&#xD;
Cormac, she (Mrs. Dargan) would live to see his&#xD;
power laid in the dust, for she warned-him his judg-&#xD;

on a sick bed, and on Christmas Eve her Heavenly&#xD;
Father sent his angels to carry this poor victim of a&#xD;
landlord's intolerance to the throne prepared for her&#xD;
in His own celestial kingdom.'    Fortified for her&#xD;
journey by the reception of the holy sacraments, and&#xD;
with the venerable Father Esmond giving her the&#xD;
absolution for the dying, she peacefully drew her&#xD;
last sigh.&#xD;
All day on the festival of Christmas poor Norah&#xD;
watched beside the bed on which lay the silent,&#xD;
wasted form of her loved mother. She would smile,&#xD;
and courtesy to the candles, to the crucifix at the&#xD;
head of the bed, and to the neighbors as they came&#xD;
noiselessly in ; then, fixing her' eyes upon her mother&#xD;
she would sing in a subdued tone a verse from a&#xD;
beautiful Christmas carol taught her by the nuns:&#xD;
"God rest ye all good Christians,&#xD;
Upon this blessed morn&#xD;
The Lord of all good Christians&#xD;
was of a woman born.&#xD;
Now all your sorrows He doth heal,&#xD;
Your sins He takes away ;&#xD;
For Jesus Christ our Saviour&#xD;
was born on Christmas day."&#xD;
No one remembered to have told her it was&#xD;
Christmas day; but with that intuitive knowledge&#xD;
peculiar to idiots she seemed to know and compre-&#xD;
hend it all.. Might it be that those sinless childiLen&#xD;
of earth, who are d barre 1 from   worldly wisdom,&#xD;
&#xD;
being more akin to the angels, derive knowledge&#xD;
from them?  Who can fathom? On. the feast of&#xD;
St. Stephen, the first martyr, the bell in the great&#xD;
elm tree of Tinmanogue Chapel tolled mournful&#xD;
sounds through the snow-covered groves and i'avines&#xD;
of those beautiful hills. How sadly they fell on the&#xD;
hearts of those crowded in small rooms in the villa-&#xD;
ges, who but a few weeks before were the occupants&#xD;
of 'comfortable farm-houses now levelled with the&#xD;
earth ! Not a few wished to be laid to rest in that&#xD;
old familiar graveyard whither the neighbors were&#xD;
with measured tread conveying a widow of the once&#xD;

Well, to return to the 26th of November.&#xD;
After the noble exploit of levelling the house of&#xD;

in all the pride of military pomp to the townlands&#xD;
of Drissmore, Tinmanogue and Ardmore. house&#xD;
after house was levelled, and the occupants flung-out&#xD;
like weeds on the highway. Two children, sick with&#xD;
the scarlet fever, were carried out by the bailiffs&#xD;
and laid in the ditch with hardly any covering,&#xD;
while their mother, a poor widow, awoke the echoes&#xD;
with her cries. One of them died during:the night.&#xD;

Their crime was found out, and the cold ditch side&#xD;
Was their hospital at last.&#xD;
Slowly they went to the poor-house and grave,&#xD;
But the Lord they bent to their souls will save."&#xD;
Some of the best dwellings and the choicest farms&#xD;
were reserved for the pets of the landlord.&#xD;
Always desiring to appear humane and merciful&#xD;
while he played the tyrant, Lord Biggs racked his&#xD;
brain to devise some excuse for evicting Toney Byrne,&#xD;
whom he knew the whole country regarded as the&#xD;
rightful owner-of those broad acres and that stately&#xD;
castle which he desecrated by his hypocritical pres&#xD;
ence.&#xD;
The name of an O'Byrne was hateful to his ears,&#xD;
and he vowed mentally to get rid of the whole&#xD;
" nest of vipers " off the estate. If little Patrick&#xD;
had lived all would be easy enough; but now Andy&#xD;
and Mike were too much grown to go to school, and&#xD;
Winnie's children were too young. What was to&#xD;
be done? He  consulted Margin, and that worthy&#xD;
individual came at once to the rescue. He advised&#xD;
his lordship to send Bible-readers to instruct such&#xD;
families as had no children fit for school, and to be&#xD;
guided by their treatment of those " Apostolic&#xD;
men ;" " for I think my lord, with all due respect&#xD;
for your lordship's better judgment, these adults,&#xD;
being (according to nature) nearer their end than&#xD;
&#xD;
the younger ones, require as much, yea, even more,&#xD;
to be regaled and strengthened by ' the Word,"'&#xD;
"Thou art a very Solomon, my good Margin, '&#xD;
exclaimed Lord Biggs in an ecstasy; "it is a most&#xD;
sage advice, and shall be acted upon without delay.&#xD;
Send Faulkner to me."&#xD;
Margin went off gleefully, rubbing his hands as&#xD;
was his wont when pleased with himself.&#xD;
Next day Faulkner commenced his labors. He&#xD;
was ordered to go every day to certain families&#xD;
named, and to read and expound for them the Holy&#xD;
Scriptures. Toney Byrne saw im mediately the drift&#xD;
of this proceeding.  He accordingly took every&#xD;
day to the fields ~is two sons, and kept them&#xD;
by him. He enjoined his wife to keep her ears&#xD;
stuffed with cotton or wool, and to continue what-&#xD;
ever employment she was at, never heeding the ex-&#xD;
pounder.&#xD;
Things continued thus for a while. But one day&#xD;
Andy complained of feeling sick, and came home&#xD;
from the field about eleven o'clock for the purpose&#xD;
of lying down on the bed.&#xD;
Faulkner had just finished his exposition and was&#xD;
leaving, when he espied the scapular which Mrs.&#xD;
Byrne usually wore, and which had escaped from&#xD;
her dress. Like a tiger he sprang forward, and, with.&#xD;

out a word of warning, tore it from her neck.* Mrs.&#xD;
Byrne screamed, and Andy, jumping on the Bible-&#xD;
reader, pounded him until he cried for mercy. An-&#xD;
dy then seized his Bible, tore it in litters, and cast&#xD;
both it and the expounder out of the back door un-&#xD;
til he landed them on a heap of manure in the pig&#xD;
yard. This sealed the doom of the Byrnes, but To.&#xD;
ney never regretted it. He would. always avoid&#xD;
quarrels; but when the proper time came for defend.&#xD;
ing the right he was not the one to flinch.&#xD;
Lord Biggs professed to act with great leniency in&#xD;
not prosecuting the Byrnes after such atrocious con-&#xD;
duct, merely contenting himself with dispossessing&#xD;
such evil-disposed, disorderly tenants from his estate.&#xD;
* See Partry Evictions.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
THE sorrow and compassion felt for the Byrnes&#xD;
was greater than for all' the other tenantry put to-&#xD;
gether. Loud were the wailings and deep the&#xD;
curses when "notice to quit" was served on Anthony&#xD;
Byrne. A day or two before the arrival of "the&#xD;
crow-bar brigade," every species of vehicle, from Mr.&#xD;
De Courcy's carriage to the market-carts of the&#xD;
farmers on the neighboring estates, and jaunting-&#xD;
cars from the towns around, were tendered to Toney&#xD;
Byrne to convey him and his, family away before&#xD;
the bailiffs would come.&#xD;
His daughter Margaret Donohoe and her husband&#xD;
also came and brought three wagons to convey her&#xD;
parents and brothers, also Winnie and Bryan Demp-&#xD;
sey and their little fainily,. to their home-not wish-&#xD;
ing Margin to have the satisfaction of putting them&#xD;
out. These testimonies of respect and affection&#xD;
deeply touched the heart of Toney, and made his&#xD;
eyes fill to overflowing; but he stoutly refused to be&#xD;
treated differently from the other tenants.&#xD;
"No, sir; I humbly thank you from my heart&#xD;

kindness, but I can't accept of it. I am but a sim&#xD;

stock it is only another reason why I should stand&#xD;
by my people. He is but a sorry captain, sir, that&#xD;
abandons his men in the hour of .danger, and it&#xD;
would badly become an O'Byrne to desert the old&#xD;
neighbors."&#xD;
Such wras the substance of Toney's reply to all;&#xD;
and this noble unselfishness but made the wail of&#xD;
grief the deeper when lie stepped out in the torrents&#xD;
of rain that chill November morning, leanin gon the'&#xD;
arm of his daughter Margaret-the rest of the family&#xD;
following in silence, except poor Mrs. Byrne, whose&#xD;
half-stifled sobs were echoed by the women around.&#xD;
When he got a short distance up the hill Toney&#xD;
stopped, determined to watch to the last the destrue-&#xD;
tion of his home, but it was not levelled. Margin.&#xD;
after fastening the windows and doors, put the key&#xD;
in his pocket.&#xD;
A fortnight subsequently it was taken posses-&#xD;
sion of by Sandy McGlauren, the Scotch steward.&#xD;
Toney and his family were carried by Margaret&#xD;
and her husband to Coolanish, where they were joy-&#xD;
fully welcomed by all the Donohoes and their lion-&#xD;

selves useful as possible in their altered sphere.&#xD;
Bryan Dempsey, Winnie, treir children, and his&#xD;
blind father and paralyzed grandmother were also&#xD;
evicted in the torrents of rain and were taken by a&#xD;
cousin of his to his farm some eight miles distant.&#xD;
Subsequently Bryan Dempsey rented a small cot-&#xD;
tage and garden in the suburbs of Ardmore, and as&#xD;
he had still left a horse, cart, and a couple of cows,&#xD;
he worked about with the neighboring farmers and&#xD;
kept his family pretty comfortable.&#xD;
Every one vied in showing kindness to Bryan, for&#xD;
they all loved and respected him for his affectionate&#xD;
attention to his decrepid relatives, as well as for his&#xD;
cheerful countenance and child-like simplicity of&#xD;
character. Wiie, too, was a great favorite, and&#xD;
was as dutiful and respectful to her father-in-law and&#xD;
to old granny as Bryan could desire.&#xD;
Many of the other tenants opened little shops in&#xD;
the provision line and public houses in the neigh-&#xD;
boring towns and villages. Many more emigrated&#xD;

THE BYRNES OF GLENGOULAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
Toney Byrne rented a few acres of land from&#xD;
Toni Donohoe, for he would not live in a state of&#xD;
dependence while able to work, so they got on in&#xD;
peace and virtue, and blessed God for the comforts&#xD;
they enjoyed; but his heart yearned in spite of him&#xD;
for the hills of Wicklow, which were dear to him as&#xD;
beautiful Grenada to the sorrowing Moor, and for&#xD;
the old homestead in Glengoulah, which was his&#xD;
Alhambra.&#xD;
One night, the first week in January, that same&#xD;
homestead was discovered to be on fire; and while the&#xD;
Scotchman and his family were trying to extinguish&#xD;
the flames in one place it suddenly broke out with&#xD;
even more violence in another and another. And as&#xD;
the wind was in a frolicsome humor that night, lie&#xD;
roared up the broad chimneys and danced along ihe&#xD;
flaming roof; sticking out tongues of flame through the&#xD;
window-frames, and, rolling up the burning thatch,&#xD;
carried off great bundles, letting them spitefully fall&#xD;
in the farm-yard, where the cattle were assembled.&#xD;
He played all sorts of pranks in the hay-loft and sta-&#xD;
ble-going wild with delight when the terrified&#xD;
horses reared and plunged with extended eye-balls.&#xD;
The neighbors came running from all sides, but&#xD;
whether they got suddenly weak at the prospect, or&#xD;
from whatever cause, they gave but little assistance&#xD;
&#xD;
in saving the house, contenting themselves with car-&#xD;
rying out of danger the cattle, farming implements,&#xD;
etc., and in preventing the fire from spreading be-&#xD;
yond the premises. The flames ceased not until the&#xD;
home of Toney Byrne, from which the poor and the&#xD;
stranger never, turned without receiving comfort,&#xD;
was laid in ashes. The pretty garden and flower-&#xD;
beds were trampled under the feet of men and horses,&#xD;
while the beautiful evergreens, the gift of Mr. De&#xD;
Courcy, stood like charred and blackened sentinels&#xD;
presiding over the destruction of the smihing garden&#xD;
they once contributed to adorn.&#xD;
1is reverend lordship turned up the whites of his&#xD;
eyes in holy horror at the depravity of the human&#xD;
heart, declaring he made no doubt it was "that&#xD;
wily Byrne who sent his emissaries to destroy the&#xD;
house he could no longer occupy, and he felt con-&#xD;
vinced he was instigated to commit the deed by. that&#xD;
old priest, who would, of course, give him absolution&#xD;
for it."&#xD;
The real truth was, poor Toney was almost the&#xD;
only one who did not rejoice when the news spread&#xD;
that Byrne's farm-house was burned, and that Sandy&#xD;
had to find another home.&#xD;
"Divil's cure to him !" was the invariable response.&#xD;
" He grudged a dacent man the last foothold he had&#xD;

on what belonged, to all his generations since the&#xD;
time of the Pynaszans. He was etarnally stickin'&#xD;
his nose about Byrne's farin, and measurin' the house&#xD;
wid his eye, and he could not speed better bad-luck&#xD;
to all of his sort."&#xD;
"Be my conscience, then, boys, ye have no raison&#xD;
to rejoice," cried Lame Jerry, "for if ye knew but&#xD;
all, its, just what Sandy wanted. Myself, thinks as&#xD;
the divil takes caie of his own, his black majesty&#xD;
set fire to it to oblige him. Didn't lie tell Perry&#xD;
Deacon, the bailiff, in my own hearin', though he&#xD;
didn't see me, that he liked the farm  mighty well,&#xD;
but found the house unconvanient; the ladies of&#xD;
his family would like a better house."&#xD;
Oh ! then the divil choke his impudence ! The&#xD;
ladies, eneagh ! Ha; ha, ha! Throughth, its enough.&#xD;
to make a dog laugh, let alone a Christian."&#xD;
"Well, take it aisey now, avid !I'll lay my life&#xD;
Lord Biggs ahemm, God bless the mark!) will be&#xD;
soon buildin' him a fine house to compensate him&#xD;
for the wickedness of these house-burnin' Papists;&#xD;
and ten to one but Margin will be layin' a present-&#xD;
ment before the grand jury to levy the expenses off&#xD;
the county as it was the work of an incendiary.&#xD;
Take Jerry O'llara's word for it, yell be' made&#xD;
amenable for this crime, and Lord Biggs, Margin&#xD;
&#xD;
and Sandy will put their tongues in their cheek.&#xD;
My friends, they're all arcades ambo; but, as yo&#xD;
don't understand Greek, I'll be biddin' ye good&#xD;
morning. "&#xD;
We may well surmise that this state of things&#xD;
made secret societies flourish where they never took&#xD;
root before. Nightly meetings were held in church-&#xD;
yards, ruined buildings, and oftenest on the heap of&#xD;
rubbish which marked the spot of a once happy&#xD;
home. Those societies were unknown in Glengoulah&#xD;
during the agency of Mr. De Courcy, while they&#xD;
were in full blast in the neighboring mining districts&#xD;
under the management of Margin.&#xD;
Now all the evicted tenantry were invited to join&#xD;
them. Many did so, and others refused to have any-&#xD;
thing to do with midnight assemblies and secret&#xD;
oaths. Among the latter was Bryan Dempsey, who&#xD;
would never listen to their solicitations. As to To-&#xD;
ney 3yrne, they never even dared to name it to him,&#xD;
his religious principles being too well known.&#xD;
One night a meeting of this kind was held, and&#xD;
"the Right Reverend Samuel Wilson Biggs, Lord&#xD;
Bishop of Ardmore and Glengoulah by the grace&#xD;
of-Act of Parliament. was indicted before Judge&#xD;
Starlight for the wilful murder of the widow Cor-&#xD;

Bridget Flannigan, besides many, many others, too&#xD;
numerous to mention ; also, for depriving Norah&#xD;
Cormac of her reason by brutal treatment in forcing&#xD;
her to attend his proselytizing school, etc., etc."&#xD;
Witnesses were called and duly examined, but as&#xD;
these cases are already known to the reader it is un-&#xD;
necessary to repeat them here.&#xD;
The last witness who gave his testimony was Mi-&#xD;
chael Flannigau. He was an old man, with bent&#xD;
form, and hair white as snow. He tottered forward&#xD;
and took from his breast pocket a soiled and torn&#xD;
letter, blotched in many places by the blistering&#xD;
tears dropped upon it. The sight of it sent a shiver&#xD;
through his aged frame, and, as soon as lie could&#xD;
speak, he exclaimed:&#xD;
"Boys, ye all know my fine, manly boy Peter,&#xD;
turned of three and twenty, and my two putty little&#xD;
girls that couldn't brook to see their mother and me&#xD;
in hardship. When we were put out of the ould&#xD;
place they all emigrated to America, lavin' us for a&#xD;
while on my cousin Jack Flannigan's floor. A good&#xD;
friend lie ever proved to me and mine-God bless&#xD;
him for it! We were only one week turned out&#xD;
when they went to America. Read this letter; they&#xD;
wrote it to the mother and me from Liverpool."&#xD;
One of the men stepped forward and read the let&#xD;
&#xD;
ter. It was, as usual with Irish letters, brimful of&#xD;
the heart, every second line being dear father and&#xD;
mfotlher: "Don't fret for us, dear father and mother;&#xD;
we are young and strong, thanks be to God for it.&#xD;
We will soon earn a comfortable home for ye both,&#xD;
dear father and mother-a home where old Biggs&#xD;
can't get us, and ye'll end your days in pace, plaze&#xD;
God. Keep up your hearts, dear father and mother;&#xD;
time wont be long passing , we'll soon see one an-&#xD;
other again. Pray to God and his Blessed Mother&#xD;
for us-we're to sail to-morrow, dear father and&#xD;
mother, in a fine ship called the 'Ocean Spray.'&#xD;
They say she goes a'm'ost as fast as a steamer, and&#xD;
looks grand on the water. God bless you, dear pa-&#xD;
rents; you'll soon hear again, plaze God, from your&#xD;
lovin' children. Till death.&#xD;
"rETER, MARY, AND BRIDGET FLANNIGAN."&#xD;
After a few moments the old man, whose head&#xD;
was bowed to his knees and covered with his hands&#xD;
while the letter was reading, rose up again and said,&#xD;
in a trembling voice: " My children never seen the&#xD;
American shore: the ship went down in the Irish&#xD;
say, where she came agin a steamer in a fog, and&#xD;
over four hundred emigrants perished.* My heart's&#xD;
treasures were drowned in sight of the very hills&#xD;

where they were born and played through many ;I&#xD;

"I buried their mother in three weeks in Tinma-&#xD;
nogue-her heart broke; and now I'm childless,&#xD;
homeless, and well nighi upon severity years. It&#xD;
they were left in the ould place, and not forced by&#xD;
a tyrant to transport themselves, my children would&#xD;
be alive to-day; and I now accuse ould Biggs of be-&#xD;
ing their murderer."&#xD;
" What did he eject you for?" asked Judge Star-&#xD;
light. " Did you pay your rent? "  " Yes, to the&#xD;
farthin'; here is my last resate."&#xD;
" Well, you had no child young enough to go to&#xD;
school. I don't see what excuse he had to put you&#xD;
out."  "The bailiff told me he said I was a danger-&#xD;
ous character, because I lent Father O'Tool a&#xD;
cart." *&#xD;
Curses loud and deep fell from every lip. Flan-&#xD;
nigan resumed : "I know an ould man like me,&#xD;
wid one foot in the grave, ought not to be thinkin'&#xD;
of revenge, but I can't help it. I wander over the&#xD;
ruins of my ould home and think I see before me&#xD;
the fire-side, and my children sittin' round it in&#xD;
comfort still; then I start up. And when the wind&#xD;

the old inaf's eyes, and in that rough assembly,&#xD;
where all were ready for deeds of violence-per-&#xD;
chance some already stained with blood-every&#xD;
heart was touched, and many a coarse-sleeve was&#xD;
drawn hastily across the. eyes. Judge Starlight&#xD;
arose, summed up the evidence, and called upon the&#xD;
jury to decide upon his guilt or innocence. A ver-&#xD;
dict of guilty was rendered in five minutes. Then&#xD;
the judge in a solemn voice pronounced upor him&#xD;
" the sentence of Death !-to be executed at the&#xD;
earliest and best opportunity by some one of the&#xD;
present assembly allotted and sworn for the purpose."&#xD;
Then followed the drawing of lots; and one being&#xD;
appointed, a terrible oath was put to him that, with-&#xD;
out fear or pity, he would execute that sentence as&#xD;
directed the first opportunity, he being furnihlJ&#xD;
by the society with fire-arms for the purpose.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
CHRISTMAS came with a great fall of snow, the&#xD;
greatest that had been seen for a number of years;&#xD;
but Glengoulah Castle was unusually gay. The&#xD;
lord bishop who ruled there had gone to visit&#xD;
his home in England the previous summer, taking&#xD;
with him her right reverend ladyship and his two&#xD;
sisters.&#xD;
They returned in time to enjoy the Christmas fes'&#xD;
tivities, and brought with them a large party of&#xD;
fashionable visitors. Among those visitors were two&#xD;
young ladies in. the bloom of youth and beauty,&#xD;
nieces of her ladyship. They were the daughters&#xD;
of Sir Harold Menville, of Menville Hall, Middlesex,&#xD;
and their mother was sister to her reverend ladyship.&#xD;
The elder of those girls, though a very estimable&#xD;
young lady, was a stately beauty, and a good deal&#xD;
more worldly than her sister ; but Clara was a laugh-&#xD;
ter-loving, mischievous young brunette, all impulse,&#xD;
and with a heart brimful of merriment and kindly&#xD;
feelings. They were enchanted with the lovely&#xD;
scenery, even though the charming hills were covered&#xD;
&#xD;
with-snow, and the swollen Ovoca stole darkly and&#xD;
silently along through the leafless groves. There&#xD;
was a dash of romance about their excursions up the&#xD;
mountains that pleased their fancy, and the pic-&#xD;
turesque costume of the peasantry set them into ec-&#xD;
stacies, especially Clara. She loved to go into the&#xD;
farmhouses and cottages and converse with the in-&#xD;
mates, especially the children. Soon finding out she&#xD;
was of a different stamp from the Biggs tribe, the&#xD;
women told her and her sister of the many visits&#xD;
paid them by the Misses Biggs to draw them from&#xD;
their faith. Though very indignant to hear it, both&#xD;
sisters made it a subject of amusement to them dur-&#xD;
ing their stay. They first complained to their aunt,&#xD;
hoping she would put a stop to it; but they found&#xD;
she was a party in the scheme, and,_to their great&#xD;
regret, they were forbidden to visit any mere in Irish&#xD;
cottages unless accompanied by the Misses Biggs.&#xD;
Clara vowed revenge, and never ceased to tanta-&#xD;
lize the spinster sisters. She would irreverently sing&#xD;
snatches of hymns through her nose; quote all the&#xD;
passages she could hunt up in the Bible which con-&#xD;
demned women preachers, and recount for their ed-&#xD;
ification the number of their aristocratic friends in&#xD;
England who had of late embraced Catholicism, and&#xD;
wish she had courage enough to follow their example,&#xD;

&#xD;
as she certainly would before long; not that she had&#xD;
really ever bothered herself on a subject so serious,&#xD;
but just for mischief.&#xD;
The Misses Biggs, though boiling over, were forced&#xD;
to be silent.&#xD;
There was to be a grand dinner-party on Christ-&#xD;
mas day at the castle, and a great ball on St.&#xD;
Stephen's day. Numbers of guests had been invited&#xD;
--some from Dublin---for the occasion; and the cas-&#xD;
tle shone resplendent from the servants' hall to the&#xD;
battlements, from which the "Union Jack" proudly&#xD;
floated.&#xD;
On the night of Christmas eve the English guests&#xD;
were all assembled in the great drawing-room of&#xD;
the castle. Muffed chandeliers shed a flood of. mel-&#xD;
low light on the silken hangings of pale amber.&#xD;
Carpets of the softest Persian texture, gorgeous&#xD;
mirrors shaded off with French lace, inlaid tables&#xD;
of inestimable value, and luxurious ottomans, made&#xD;
this noble apartment a fit abode for royalty. Splen-&#xD;
did fires blazed in the ample grates of polished steel&#xD;
that stood within mantel pieces of the most elabor-&#xD;
ate antique carving, each of which was in itself a&#xD;
gem of art. At one of the inlaid tables, in a nook&#xD;
beside the fire, sat his lordship with the Honorable&#xD;
Augustus Kiskdale. Between them was a Chines&#xD;
&#xD;
chess-board of exquisite workmanship-both were&#xD;
most intent on the game. Dowagers and " men of&#xD;
high degree" played at whist or chatted- in groups&#xD;
around the room. A bunch of young beauties were&#xD;
laughing merrily with a troop- of -young military&#xD;
gentlemen.&#xD;
Miss Menville was turning the leaves of a scrap-&#xD;
book, which was gallantly held for her by a youthful&#xD;
officer of artillery. Her sister Clara was seated at&#xD;
a magnificent harp, the strings of which she softly&#xD;
swept with a master touch, often stop ping to enjoy&#xD;
a burst of merry laughter at the remarks of a stiff,&#xD;
formal-looking baronet, who was turn in g the leaves&#xD;
of her -music and giving utterance to some sombre&#xD;
love speeches of his own peculiar invention. Here&#xD;
was a picture of life, with all its comforts-with all&#xD;
its luxuries.&#xD;
Without, a wild storm was raging. The wind&#xD;
roared up the, chimneys, crashed furiously' against&#xD;
the heavy stone casements, and ran tearing and&#xD;
tumbling along the battlements as if meditating the&#xD;
destruction of the whole building. ' Then would&#xD;
come a lull of ominous import, as if the elements&#xD;
were mustering their forces for a fresh attack.&#xD;
hark! What's that ? A wild gust of snow, sleet,&#xD;
wind, and driving rain, came gushing madly against&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
the shutters of the drawing-room, which however&#xD;
were of great strength and securely fastened, but&#xD;
they could not shut out a blinding flash of forked&#xD;
igi itnin g, followed instantaneously by a tremendous&#xD;
crash of thunder which rocked the castle to its foun-&#xD;
dations and made the high-born guests turn pale and&#xD;
shiver with fear. His right reverend lordship, who&#xD;
had just captured a "king's bishop " from his oppo-&#xD;
nent, covered his face with his trembling hands.&#xD;
Another clap and crash on the battlements split&#xD;
the flag-staff through the centre, tore the Union&#xD;
Jack in shreds, and brought down a stacX of chimn-&#xD;
neys in the back part of the building. 3 oe ladies&#xD;
gathered in a terrified group around the "re-place&#xD;
near which his lordship sat, excepting the Misses&#xD;
Menville, who quite enjoyed the scene. The wirth-&#xD;
loving Clara fairly danced with glee. "Oji, how&#xD;
grand !" she cried. " Howl on, old storm ; 3 lkve&#xD;
your music ! Oh, for a ramble up the mountains&#xD;
to-night ! What say you, Sir William?" she said&#xD;
to her grim admirer, who sat stiff and pale with&#xD;
fright.&#xD;
A rueful smile lighted up the baronet's face.&#xD;
"You are full of mirth to-night, Miss Clara."&#xD;
"Upon my honor I am perfectly serious, sir baro.&#xD;
et." And the young mischief dropped him a stately&#xD;
&#xD;
courtesy. "I command you as a true and faithful&#xD;
knight to follow me. Will you? or will you not?"&#xD;
Before he had time to fashion a reply, sundry&#xD;
screams and the flight of the ladies to the farthest&#xD;
corner of the drawing-room  made both turn. The&#xD;
door had been softly opened, and on its threshold&#xD;
stood a slight girlish form with bare and bleeding&#xD;
feet, dressed in a long white gown, her dark chest-&#xD;
nut hair flowed down to her waist, andl she was per-&#xD;
fectly drenched by the storm.&#xD;
Even Clara for a moment shrank back appalled&#xD;
by the apparition. Advancing into the apartment&#xD;
she seemed to take no notice of the company, but&#xD;
smiled and courtesied to the chandeliers one by one.&#xD;
Just then the great bell in the tower chimed for&#xD;
midnight. All at once she burst forth in a wild&#xD;
sweet voice :&#xD;
," God rest ye, merry Christians,&#xD;
Upon this blessed morn&#xD;
The Lord of all good Christians&#xD;
Was ofra woman born.&#xD;
Now all your sorrows he doth heal,&#xD;
Your sins he takes away,&#xD;
For Jesus Christ our Saviour&#xD;
Was born on Christmas Day.&#xD;
It was poor Norah Cormac. No one had seen&#xD;
her enter the castle, but she came unheeding the&#xD;
wild elements, and stood face to face with the wretch&#xD;
who had robbed her of home, kindred, and reason&#xD;

He saw her now by the light of the chandeliers and'&#xD;
knew her perfectly. Iis eyes scoiled like a demon's,&#xD;
and he cowered over his inlaid table and shaded his&#xD;
wan face with his hands. Norah heeded him not-&#xD;
she was still smiling, nodding, and conversing with&#xD;
the soft lights shining down on her dripping form.&#xD;
Clara was the first to approach her. Being satis-&#xD;
fled it was no spirit, she at once surmised her to be&#xD;
some poor idiot, and her heart was touched with&#xD;
pity. Advancing toward her she said : "What is the&#xD;
matter with you, my poor girl? You are thoroughly&#xD;
drenched; wont you have some diy clothes and a&#xD;
good supper? Norah again sang her favorite hymn,&#xD;
"God rest ye all," etc.&#xD;
The ladies were quite horrified when Clara ap-&#xD;
proached the unearthly-looking being, who seemed&#xD;
so unconscious of the presence in which she stood.&#xD;
When they saw, however, how young she was, they&#xD;
began to revive, and her pitiable condition excited&#xD;
their commiseration. Her reverend ladyship rang&#xD;
for the servants, greatly to the relief of her reverend&#xD;
lord, who would have given a goodly sum for the re-&#xD;
moval of Norah. The servants gathered around her&#xD;
in a group, and their lady ordered them to take her&#xD;
to the kitchen, and to provide her with dry, warm&#xD;
clothes, and a comfortable supper ; but the order&#xD;
&#xD;
was easier given than executed., Norah would not&#xD;
move a step for all their entreaties; she had fixed&#xD;
her attention on one particular globe in the chande-&#xD;
lier, and kept nodding and speaking rapidly to it in&#xD;
a low tone.&#xD;
The bishop feared to speak, but he motioned to&#xD;
the servants to carry her off at once. The burley&#xD;
coachman was selected as the ablest, though he exa&#xD;
hibited' the strongest symptoms of disgust at the&#xD;
idea of lifting that dripping form in his flne, clothes.&#xD;
" My heyes! " he exclaimed; "but ain't she -wet&#xD;
though?. my welvet smalls and silken hose will be&#xD;
utterly ruined ! What shall I do? " Hereupon he&#xD;
heaved a deep sigh and made a despairing grab at&#xD;
Norah. In an instant his powdered wig was flying&#xD;
into the fire, and his eyes blinded by a dash of long&#xD;
wet hair. The unfortunate coachman ran for his&#xD;
life down stairs, upsetting the housemaid in his&#xD;
rapid descent, and causing such fright and consterna-&#xD;
tion among the rest of the. servants that none of&#xD;
them would enter the room again for anybody's&#xD;
order.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
CLARA again approached the maniac girl and said,&#xD;
gently, "My poor child, I wish to be your friend,"&#xD;
and she took her cold wet hand in hers; "do come&#xD;
with me to the warm fire, and let me give you dry&#xD;
clothes. Now I know you will come with me," and&#xD;
she tried to draw her gently. Norah was like a&#xD;
lamb in her hands until she moved; but she then re.&#xD;
sisted, and exclaimed : "Oh, no, no ! I could not eat&#xD;
here. I wont have dry clothing! I will never be&#xD;
warm again! Oh! you don't know where I was to-&#xD;
night. ~When the wind was tearing up the trees'&#xD;
and the thunder crashing as if all the heavens were&#xD;
falling, I was sitting calm and quiet on her grave&#xD;
singing ! You did not know her,-she's gone to God;&#xD;
she died this night, and she always makes me sing&#xD;
that hymn." Here she again sang softly "God rest&#xD;
ye," etc. Clara once more tried to draw her away ;&#xD;
but Norah frowned, and again cried : " No, no!&#xD;
Not for all the world would I sit by his fire! If I&#xD;
ate a bit it would choke me! She was my mother ;&#xD;
and she had no one to love but me. I sat on her&#xD;
&#xD;
grave to-night in Tinmanogue in all the storm, and&#xD;
she bid me come and see him. No one knows how&#xD;
I got into the castle ! Ha, ha, ha ! I wont tell that;&#xD;
no, no, he'll never know that !- Ha, haha! It was&#xD;
he sent her to the grave and left me lonely !" And&#xD;
the poor girl looked so woe-begone up in Clara's face&#xD;
that the young lady's eyes filled with tears. "Who&#xD;
left you lonely, my poor girl ?"&#xD;
" Biggs ; old Biggs over there !" and she tossed her&#xD;
head in the direction -of the splendid chessboard,&#xD;
whose kings and knights now lay unheeded, for the&#xD;
whole company were listening in breathless silence&#xD;
to the wailings of the young maniac. "lie's a bishop&#xD;
now, they say. Ha, ha, ha! He turned her out on&#xD;
the road as cold and as wet a day as, this, and she&#xD;
died from it. She bid me come and let him put me&#xD;
out again; and then I'll go home to God. That's&#xD;
what brought me here to-night.  He must do it&#xD;
himself ; I'll make him ! Ha, ha, ha! God rest&#xD;
ye," etc.&#xD;
" My poor girl, your fears are groundless; the&#xD;
bishop would not harm you." She grasped Clara's&#xD;
arm. "Not harm ie ? You don't know him. He&#xD;

gold he has, and he put her out in the torrents of&#xD;
rain in her sick bed. Mrs. Dargan took us both to&#xD;
her house for the love of God, but my mother died&#xD;
on Christmas eve."&#xD;
" But, my poor child, he would not harm you."&#xD;
Clara's tears flowed down her cheeks.&#xD;
" I will tell you it was mc he wanted. Didn't lie&#xD;
send Faulkner, the Bible-reader, to bring me along to&#xD;
school? But he couldn't catch me, though. Ia, ha,&#xD;
ha! He chased me; but lie couldn't catch me. Iha,&#xD;
ha, ha ! When I think'of it I laugh 'till I cry again.&#xD;
I thought of it sitting on her grave to-night, and I&#xD;
roared out laughing, only the thunder smothered my&#xD;
voice." The laugh of this poor maniac was perfectly&#xD;
appalling, and made the wretched tyrant shiver with&#xD;
terror.&#xD;
Norah continued: "Do you know what I did?&#xD;
That lightning flash did not speed quicker through&#xD;
the black heavens to-night than I flew till I got to&#xD;
the river bank, and in I jumped. It was high water&#xD;
too, and I was swept down, down-I don't know any&#xD;
more; and I never could remember anything since.&#xD;
There was always some confusion here" (putting her&#xD;
hands to her temples), "but it all came back to me&#xD;
to-night-the storm brought it all back, and she told&#xD;
me how we were dragged out in the torrents from&#xD;
&#xD;

our home. I took a fancy to dress in white always ;&#xD;
I think it a pretty dress." (And she looked down&#xD;
complacently at her wet and tattered garment.)&#xD;
"The boys used to call me white lady, some of them ;&#xD;
others called me crazy Norah, and all sorts of names,&#xD;
in fun ; but they never hurt me." Clara caught at&#xD;
the idea. "Well, Noriah, I have a sweet white dress&#xD;
of my own, which I will give you; come, let us try&#xD;
it on, and see if it will fit." Lord Biggs would have&#xD;
given half his estate to be out of the room, but he&#xD;
feared to stir. Now, however, he took the opportunity&#xD;
of the change in her conversation, and was gliding&#xD;
quietly to the door. In a twinkling Norah was hold-&#xD;
ing on to his arm with a death grasp. His teeth ac-&#xD;
tually chattered with dread. " Ha, ia,ha! Old&#xD;
Biggs! did you think you could escape me ? Do&#xD;
you think .I crossed the mountains to-night with&#xD;
torn and bleeding feet, in all the wild stormito let&#xD;
you off without doi  her bidding? I'd tear you&#xD;
in bits easier than  ir bull dog tore my dress, if&#xD;
you didn'-t do her bidding!" Her eyes gleamed on&#xD;
him with a maniac fire that froze the blood in his&#xD;
veins. "She bid me not leave the castle until you&#xD;
put me out in the torrents, as you did before from&#xD;
our home; and then you'll see me no more, for God&#xD;
said he'd take me to His home then. Do you hear&#xD;

me, Biggs?" (And she shook the wretched man with&#xD;
that supernatural strength peculiar to maniacs.&#xD;
" Come, come on ! God's messengers are waiting&#xD;
for me, andlher bidding must be done."&#xD;
He looked imploringly around. A young offreer&#xD;
made an adroit movement to pinion her arms be-&#xD;
hind, but she blinded him, as she" did the burly&#xD;
coachman, by a slap of her long wet hair.&#xD;
All drew back in terror. Clara alone seemed to&#xD;
retain her presence of mind.&#xD;
" Lead her down, uncle," she said; "humor her&#xD;
and when she's once outside I will go with her down&#xD;
the steps and coax her around to the kitchen door."&#xD;
" Come, come! " cried Norah, clutching his arm;&#xD;
I can't let you wait." So down he led her to the&#xD;
great hall, followed closely by Clara, who flew into&#xD;
the back hall and secured a couple of cloaks. Her&#xD;
aunt, shaking like one in an ague fit, watched the&#xD;
scene amid her guests from the grand staircase.&#xD;
Biggs opened the, door, and Norah once more'&#xD;
singing out-&#xD;
"'God rest ye, merry Christians,"&#xD;
walked out into the wild storm. Clara was spring&#xD;
ing after her, but her uncle pushed her back, slam-&#xD;
med the door violently, locked it, and then full&#xD;
fainting to the floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
In a moment he was surrounded by his sympa-&#xD;
tluzmig friends, who raised and supported huin to a&#xD;
seat.&#xD;
Terrific flashes of lurid lightning and crashing&#xD;
thunder now followed in quick succession.&#xD;
" Oh! God of heaven! Think of that poor idiot&#xD;
child out in such a storm'! " cried Clara; " she will&#xD;
die! Oh! let me follow and save her!"&#xD;
She ran to the door; but the guests interposed,&#xD;
and her aunt, turning upon her a withering look,&#xD;
exclaied-&#xD;
"Miss Clara Menville, I order you to your room&#xD;
instantly. You have made a sufficient fool, of your-&#xD;
self to-night."&#xD;
Poor Clara burst into a passion of tears, and&#xD;
Lieutenant Cordell (the 'same who tried to pinion&#xD;
Norah) approaching, assured her in a low, rapid&#xD;
voice thathe would go out and seek the idiot girl.&#xD;
So Clara was forced to retire to her room.&#xD;
The young lieutenant was true to his word. Ac.&#xD;
coinpanied by a brother officer, and a. couple of&#xD;
servants bearing lanterns, they searched the whole&#xD;
demesnee and could find no trace of the poor ma-&#xD;
niac wanderer. They returned to the castle per-&#xD;
fectly drenched.&#xD;

room, where restoratives were administered by his&#xD;
valet. The unhappy man was really sick with ter.&#xD;
ror, and shook on his couch of down like one in a&#xD;
palsy.&#xD;
Two hours later the wind gradually subsided and&#xD;
died away in hoarse murmurs, and the rain was su..&#xD;
ceeded by a thick fall of drifting snow.&#xD;
About four o'clock in the morning every inmate&#xD;
of the castle-which was now dark and still-was&#xD;
aroused by a low mournful cry. It sounded like&#xD;
noticing they had ever heard before; half like the&#xD;
howl of a dog, and half like a human shriek-low&#xD;
in its tones, yet piercing to the very heart. So dis.&#xD;
tinctly was it heard by all that each one fancied it&#xD;
came from some being outside his own window.&#xD;
A few minutes silence ensued, and, as they li.st-&#xD;
ened for a repetition, was heard a faint voice sing-&#xD;
ing slowly-.&#xD;
"Now all my sorrows He will heal,&#xD;
My sins He'll take away,&#xD;
For Jesus Christ, our Saviour,&#xD;
was born on Christmas day."&#xD;
An interval of a few seconds, and the voice again&#xD;
sang slower and fainter-&#xD;
"Saviour-&#xD;
was born-on-Christmas day!"&#xD;
In vain they listened-it was heard no more.&#xD;
Clara had lain down, but could not sleep for&#xD;

thinking of the poor maniac, and now she was&#xD;
quite delighted to hear her voice once more.&#xD;
Arising, she went to the window, softly opened&#xD;
the shutters, and tried to peer out into the darkness.&#xD;
Her window looked out upon the Ovoca, and that&#xD;
enchanting valley "where the bright waters meet."&#xD;
The dark river, swollen by the late rains, rushed&#xD;
rapidly and silently on ; the winds were all hushed,&#xD;
a peaceful calm rested on the lovely hills, while the&#xD;
snow fell in great soft flakes, arraying them in robes&#xD;
of white on that blessed Christmas morn.&#xD;
Clara closed her window very softly, and stole&#xD;
back to bed. Her heart was comforted to think&#xD;
poo.r Norah had not been lost in that frightful&#xD;
storm; then her thoughts turned upon the revela-&#xD;
tions of the maniac girl, and she writhed with&#xD;
indignation and shame to think any of her con-&#xD;
nections should persecute people for worshipping&#xD;
God in the old faith of Christian Europe ; then her&#xD;
thoughts flew back to that very night twelve months&#xD;
ago, when, in the city of London, she accompanied a&#xD;
party of friends of high rank (who had become con-&#xD;
verts)to midnight mass, and heard in one of those&#xD;
beautiful churches erected by Pugin the grand or-&#xD;
gan rolling in glorious harmony through the vaulted&#xD;
roof as the choir sang that magnificent hymn that&#xD;

fell from the lips of angels through the golden&#xD;
clouds of morn eighteen hundred years ago:&#xD;
"Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of good will 1"i&#xD;
Clara's eyes filled with tears and her heart with a&#xD;
new emotion. She resolved to leave no exertion&#xD;
untried to create a new order of things on her&#xD;
uncle's estate, and to begin by hunting up Norah&#xD;
next day anil providing everything for her comfort..&#xD;
The great clock of the castle struck five, and Clara,&#xD;
thinking and resolving, fell gradually off to sleep.&#xD;
She dreamed she was again going to midnight mass&#xD;
in London, but she had no carriage as before ; the&#xD;
snow fell fast as she found herself traversing alone&#xD;
the sedgy banks of the Ovoca, half blinded, by the&#xD;
snow and cutting her feet with the briars and stones.&#xD;
After weary travelling she seemed to reach the&#xD;
church, and a bright light shone around. She lis-&#xD;
tened entranced to the grand choir singing.  Look-&#xD;
ing up she could see no organ, no .roof--but soft&#xD;
clouds of translucent light seemed to open, and a&#xD;
troop of angels, with rapturous adoration, sang:&#xD;
" Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to men of good will I"&#xD;
Watching those celestial forms she was surprised&#xD;
to see that one smiled down upon her who had&#xD;
bleeding feet and a tattered white garment. -Gaz-&#xD;
ing at the countenance she recognized the features&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
of the young maniac girl, but her face was now ra-&#xD;
diant as the sun, and a wreath of glory rested on her&#xD;
long dark hair. Every moment she seemed to grow&#xD;
brighter, and to ascend higher and higher, until the&#xD;
clouds closed beneath her blistered feet and dark-&#xD;
ness reigned around.&#xD;
Clara, turning upon her side, fell into a deeper&#xD;
sleep, from which she did not awaken until the&#xD;
great bell rang to summon the househeld to break-&#xD;
fast.&#xD;

Clara's door gently opened, and her maid peeped&#xD;
in.&#xD;
"I am awake, Pa'mer," she said ; "come along."&#xD;
Emma Palmer caine in and busied herself about her&#xD;
young lady, but Clara saw she was troubled by some&#xD;
secret which she was dying to relate. Guessing it to&#xD;
be the supernatural cry which had been heard in&#xD;
the night, she good-naturedly resolved to gratify her.&#xD;
"What's the matter, Palmer?"  "Oh, nothing, Miss&#xD;
Clara; I hops you slept well last night, Miss."&#xD;
"Why, Emma child, you must certainly feel sick,&#xD;
for you are pale as a ghost, and drawing great heavy&#xD;
sighs constantly ; are you in any pain ?"&#xD;
"Oh, Miss Clara, I am not in any pain; but I wish&#xD;
we was back again safe in England."&#xD;
"What are you afraid of, child ?"&#xD;
"Oh, Miss Clara, I feel so nervous ; I shall never&#xD;
enjoy nothing in this country any more. They say the&#xD;
castle is haunted; we all heard the most dolefiilest&#xD;
cries last night after the rain ceased! I'm sure such&#xD;
sounds never came from the lips of any human crea-&#xD;

ture-it was a most awful cry ; then a voice began&#xD;
to sing. Oh, Miss Clara, my heart runs cold-I can't&#xD;
tell you what was found on the front steps of the&#xD;
hall door !"&#xD;
"Tell me instantly, Palmer; what do you mean?'&#xD;
speak!&#xD;
" Oh, Miss Clara, don't be angry with me. When&#xD;
the stable-boy went to clear the snow off the marble&#xD;
steps this morning lie seed a great pile of snow, as he&#xD;
thought, and took his shovel to it, but could not&#xD;
move it. He called the groom; and what did they&#xD;
find, think you? Oh, Miss Clara, it was that poor&#xD;
crazy girl, frozen to death !"&#xD;
"Oh, God! Don't tell me she is dead!" cried&#xD;
Clara, springing to her feet.&#xD;
"Miss Clara, I seed her myself," sobbed Palmer;&#xD;
"she's stone dead."&#xD;
" Oh God, have mercy on me! Oh why didI not -&#xD;
fly to her when I heard her singing-why, why did&#xD;
I let her perish ? " And Clara wrung her hands and&#xD;
wept bitterly. "Does the bishop know about this,&#xD;
Palmer ? "&#xD;
" No, Miss Clara; the valet said he was so nervous&#xD;
and frightened last night that no one should tell&#xD;
him; and they sent for a doctor, and the coroner,&#xD;
and the magistrates."&#xD;

"Who did all this? "&#xD;
"Mr. Margin, the agent; please you, Miss Clara."&#xD;
"Well, the bishop must be told of it.; he has a&#xD;
duty to fulfil. I will go to him instantly, and tell&#xD;
him myself. I do not care for his displeasure."&#xD;
Away flew Clara in her dressing-gown. Thomp.&#xD;
son, the valet, opened the door at her knock, and told&#xD;
her his lordship was dressing.&#xD;
Well, he wont mind me. I must see him."&#xD;
She rushed past Thompson and, unannounced,&#xD;
confronted the bishop, who was sitting at his toilet&#xD;
table.&#xD;
" Oh, uncle ! I want to tell your lordship some-&#xD;
thing most important."&#xD;
For a few moments sobs choked her utterance and&#xD;
large tears rolled down her cheeks.&#xD;
" Have the goodness to explain yourself, Miss,"&#xD;
exclaimed the bishop, in a cold, authoritative voice,&#xD;
which roused Clara's indignation.&#xD;
"My lord, the unfortunate maniac girl whom you&#xD;
prevented me from accompanying last night lies&#xD;
frozen to death at your door!"&#xD;
" Well, what if she does? I did my best to shel&#xD;

"No, no! niy lord; she would not accept a shel&#xD;
ter here, but I could have brought her to some other&#xD;
and saved her."&#xD;
He pretended not to hear her, and affected com-&#xD;
posure.&#xD;
"Thompson, send immediately for Mr. Margin,&#xD;
and let him see to all that is necessary."&#xD;
"He has been here an hour ago, my lord, and&#xD;
done all you would wish."&#xD;
"I am much obliged to him. Then let the mat-&#xD;
ter be mentioned to me no more, unless the coroner&#xD;
should need my testimony."&#xD;
His frigid indifference, provoked Clara beyond en-&#xD;
durance.&#xD;
"My lord, my lord; I fear .there has been a foul&#xD;
wong done somewhere."&#xD;
The face of the bishop grew livid with rage, and&#xD;
the old tiger-light flashed from his eyes.&#xD;
Thompson withdrew to the outer room, but took&#xD;
care to be in good hearing distance.&#xD;
"Did-you come here to dictate to me, madame&#xD;
I do not forget your conduct last night. Only for&#xD;
your low propensities, I could have had that pauper&#xD;
instantly dismissed from my presence; but you fos-&#xD;
tered and encouraged her idle, malicious tales in the&#xD;
very presence of my guests. Yes, madam, to in-&#xD;

dulge your morbid sensibility, you allowed a driv'&#xD;
elling idiot to falsify the character of your own re'&#xD;
lation, who is, moreover, an elderly dignitary of the&#xD;
Church, and that in his own house."&#xD;
"It is false! utterly false!" exclaimed Clara.&#xD;
" When the poor victim first spoke of her wrongs&#xD;
I had no idea who her persecutor was. My lord,&#xD;
'children and fools speak truth,'-and I now believe&#xD;
all she said. I also believe the Almighty would not&#xD;
suffer an innocent sheep to perish at the door of the&#xD;
pastor if he were worthy of the name."&#xD;
She walked indignantly from   the room  and&#xD;
slammed the door after her like a cannon ball.&#xD;
Now all his pretended indifference vanished; he&#xD;
shook convulsively, and clutched at the table for&#xD;
support. Wretched tyrant ! He writhed under the&#xD;
lash of public opinion, for he drank in those bitter&#xD;
words of Clara: " Children and idiots speak truth."&#xD;
Well he knew that old adage had passed through&#xD;
more minds than her's; he read it in the faces of&#xD;
his guests in the drawing-room last night, all worldly&#xD;
though most of them were. And now-Oh.! that&#xD;
dreaded inquest-the thought was torture. All his&#xD;
long catalogue of extortions and persecutions would&#xD;
become common topics of conversation, and his as'&#xD;
sumed mask of sanctity would be rudely torn away.&#xD;

Finding himself unable to support those bitter re-&#xD;
flections and yet appear calm, he resolved to remain&#xD;
in his rooin and play the compassionate pastor, over-&#xD;
come by his feelings for one of his lost flock who&#xD;
would not be saved. Accordingly Thompson brought&#xD;
him up a dainty breakfast in a service of silver and&#xD;
gold.&#xD;
About noon the coroner arrived, and a dense&#xD;
crowd of people from town and country. It was&#xD;
many a long day since the noble lawn before the&#xD;
castle was filled by so many honest faces and feeling&#xD;
hearts. Among the rest was the venerable Father&#xD;
Esmond in the carriage with Mr. De Courcy. Al-&#xD;
though scarce able to breathe, lie came with the&#xD;
symnpathizing crowd to honor that old branch of the&#xD;
Cormnacs. Mrs. Dargan and her son were also there&#xD;
in their jaunting car, with a hearse following behind&#xD;
them containing a handsome coffin and white plumes.&#xD;
The report had spread like wildfire that Biggs had&#xD;
pushed the idiot girl out in the storm and that she&#xD;
lay down on the threshold and died of cold !&#xD;
The coroner, who was an upright man, and anxious&#xD;
to elicit truth, summoned every inmate of the castle&#xD;
to give evidence.&#xD;
Lord Biggs made a great show of regret at the&#xD;
obstinacy of the crazy girl, declaring that no father&#xD;

could be more anxious for the welfare of his child,&#xD;
but no effort of his or of his household could save&#xD;
her.&#xD;
The testimony of her ladyship and the guests and&#xD;
the servants followed; but the spectators were little&#xD;
inclined to believe any of them until Clara came&#xD;
forward; and her evidence was given with so much&#xD;
straightforwardness and real feeling that all hearts&#xD;
- were inclined in her favor.&#xD;
When requested by Mr. De Courcy to state if she&#xD;
could account for the idiot girl seeming to feel&#xD;
kindly toward her, yet refasing her proffered assist-&#xD;
ance, Clara hesitated a m nent, and then said-&#xD;
"The poor child evir ntly harbored the impres-&#xD;
sion that his lordship 4iad injured her, and nothing&#xD;
could induce her to accept his hospitality, although&#xD;
the bishop was most anxious to have every attention&#xD;
paid her."&#xD;
Lieutenant Cordell testified to. Miss Menville's&#xD;
desire to accompany the girl, and how she had pro-&#xD;
vided cloaks for the purpose, but was prevented by&#xD;
her friends from sacrificing her life on such a ter-&#xD;
rific night-but that he and Capt. Windhanm had&#xD;
taken a couple of servants and lanterns and gone&#xD;
over the whole domain without finding a trace of&#xD;
her. The people at the different lodges'declared&#xD;

she did not pass through the gates, so he was satis-&#xD;
fled she had hidden away somewhere, and that a&#xD;
further search was useless. .He said he had no doubt,&#xD;
like many maniacs, she had had a presentiment of&#xD;
her approaching death, and had taken the resolution&#xD;
of dying at the door of one whom (no doubt) her&#xD;
overwrought imagination had deemed her persecutor.&#xD;
Biggs withdrew immediately after Clara's testimony.&#xD;
A verdict was returned of "Death caused by expos-&#xD;
ure to the cold and wet."&#xD;
After the verdict was rendered Margin caine for-&#xD;
ward, and said "it was his lordship's wisi to have&#xD;
everything regarding th  funeral conducted in the&#xD;
most becoming manner and at his expense." A&#xD;
storm of voices replied, "iNo, no, never ! We'll bury&#xD;
her ourselves.  We want none of his rioney !"&#xD;
Here Mrs. Dargan's son came forward, and said his&#xD;
mother had already provided a coffin and hearse to&#xD;
carry her home ; and at her house all who respected&#xD;
the house of Cormac could see the remains of the&#xD;
young maniac laid out as became a Christian.&#xD;
This announcement was received with murmurs of&#xD;
applause-cheers were dispensed with out of respect&#xD;
to the departed. The remains were tenderly borne&#xD;
to Mrs. Dargan's, and having been waled for two&#xD;
nights, according to custom, were carried to Tin&#xD;

The funeral cortege was the longest seen in that&#xD;
part of the country since the death of Mr. de&#xD;

Glengoulah Castle was shut up and the blinds&#xD;
drawn down. His lordship dispatched messengers&#xD;
postponing the festivities indefinitely, and most of&#xD;
the guests departed for their homes.&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
THE Misses Menville wrote to their father request.&#xD;
ing to be taken home. Pending tieir father's reply&#xD;
the young ladies were scarcely noticed by their aunt&#xD;
and uncle.&#xD;
Taking advantage of the liberty thus afforded&#xD;
they frequently drove out in a little pony phaeton,&#xD;
accompanied only by: a footman. They one day&#xD;
visited the Presentation convent of Ardmore, and&#xD;
were perfectly delighted with the whole establish-&#xD;
ment, especially the schools attached to it, where the&#xD;
beautiful lace fabrics and straw-plaiting, made by&#xD;
the children, excited their wonder and adiniration.&#xD;
Here was the lie direct given to the oft-repeated&#xD;
tales of the wilful ignorance of the Irish people, and&#xD;
the lamentable darkness in which they were kept by&#xD;
their priests. Both young ladies questioned many&#xD;
of the children on different subjects, and were sur-&#xD;
prised at the quick intelligence of their replies, as&#xD;
well as their respectful and polite demeanor.&#xD;
They confessed to each' other the superiority in&#xD;
this respect of the Irish peasantry over those of their&#xD;

own country; and could not help contrasting the&#xD;
difference in the mode of education, and the happy&#xD;
looks of the children, with their uncle's false and&#xD;
forced system.&#xD;
They drew from the superioress the whole partie-&#xD;
ulars of Norah Cormac's birth and education. She&#xD;
seemed at first unwilling to speak harshly of Lord&#xD;
Biggs out of respect to their feelings, but Clara told&#xD;
her what the maniac girl had said about the Bible,&#xD;
reader and their subsequent ejectment from their&#xD;
home, so the superioress then told them the whole&#xD;
truth, and the sorrows and persecutions endured by&#xD;
the whole Catholic population who were under his&#xD;
lordship's dominion. They left a large xionation for&#xD;
the schools and returned.&#xD;
Olara came once again s alone. She said her&#xD;
father had written and would be there next day, so&#xD;
they would be leaving immediately for England.&#xD;
" I came to ask a favor of you, Reverend Mother,"&#xD;
she said, blushing deeply. "It is to remember me&#xD;
in your prayers. Mother, I am not happy ; my&#xD;
mind is not at rest;" and her eyes filled with tears,&#xD;
as did those of the good mother.&#xD;
" My dear young lady, calm yourself," h   re&#xD;
plied; "I feel assured you are very dear to the sa-&#xD;
cred heart of Jesus, and that he has great designs&#xD;

already, dear child, and daily recite a bead for you&#xD;
and your sister, to whose generosity we are so much&#xD;
indebted; but we will say additional prayers for&#xD;
you especially for the future. And now I want you&#xD;
to confer a small favor on me in return."&#xD;
As she spoke she unlocked an escritoire which&#xD;
stood in a recess, and took from one of the coinpart-&#xD;
ments a gold medal of Mary Immaculate. Present-&#xD;
ing it to Clara, she said: "Now promise me, dear&#xD;
young lady, to wear this constantly, and daily recite&#xD;
one ' Hail Mary' for light to guide you to the right&#xD;
path." Do not let sneers or frowns deter you from&#xD;
wearing this holy medal, which is blessed in the&#xD;
Catholic Church, remembering the words of Scrip-&#xD;
ture-' Every creature of God is good, and nothing&#xD;
to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving,&#xD;
for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.'&#xD;
"Should any of your friends laugh at you for&#xD;
venerating a bit of metal, remind them how the&#xD;
Israelites were cured of a venomous bite by looking&#xD;
on a piece of metal made in the form of a serpent."&#xD;
Clara, sobbing, promised faithfully to fulfil the&#xD;
request of the nun.&#xD;
The superioress embraced her warmly and they&#xD;
parted.&#xD;

&#xD;
The following year Clara had the happiness to be-&#xD;
come acquainted in London with dear Father Faber&#xD;
-the very angel of converts-and under his spiritual&#xD;
guidance she, with the consent of her father, entered&#xD;
the one sheepfold of the one shepherd!&#xD;
The death of Norah Cormac, under such circum-&#xD;
stances, did not serve to increase the popularity of&#xD;
Biggs--ie became more obnoxious than ever; and,&#xD;
as if to defy public opinion still more, lie showed his&#xD;
petty malignity by impounding every cow and pig&#xD;
that grazed along the road belonging to the pour&#xD;
cottiers. It was whispered in circles, too, where his&#xD;
habits were best known, that his applications to the&#xD;
madeira and claret in his cellar were more frequent&#xD;
than appeared seemly for a preacher of the gospel--&#xD;
it was so quietly conducted, however, that, but for&#xD;
Mr. Thompson's confidential communications to the&#xD;
housekeeper, this weakness in such a shining pillar&#xD;
of the Church would never be known.&#xD;
Some months passed away-his lady and sisters&#xD;
were on a visit to some friends in England, and were&#xD;
not expected home until Christmas.&#xD;
In the month of November Lord Biggs went to a&#xD;
dinner-party at Colonel Dickson's, whose estate lay&#xD;
contiguous to Glengoulah.&#xD;
As he was returning home, about an hour after&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;

I&#xD;
,,&#xD;
&#xD;
midnight, a shot was fired at him. He was riding&#xD;
in a small carriage, driven by the brave Jacob, so.&#xD;
noted for his slender understandings.&#xD;
The carriage had passed through the great gate,&#xD;
and his lordship, expressing a wish to alight, was as-&#xD;
sisted from it by the porter at the lodge, and he&#xD;
walked up the avenue. lie had ascended the steps&#xD;
and knocked at the hall door, when he heard the re-&#xD;
port of the gun and saw a man running. He ran&#xD;
down the steps and tried to overtake the man, but&#xD;
fell in the attempt. On getting up pe screamed for&#xD;
help, and then the door was opened and lights&#xD;
brought out, but the intended assassin was beyond&#xD;
their reach. A posse of police were sent for in-&#xD;
stanter, and while one portion were.detailed to follow&#xD;
in the direction taken by the man who fired the shot,&#xD;
another portion, acting as a body-guard, accompanied&#xD;
his lordship to a magistrate to make depositions..&#xD;
The bishop expressed a wish to make his charges&#xD;
to Mr. De Courcy, for malignant reasons of his own,&#xD;
and they accordingly proceeded to Cascade House.&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy and his household were all in bed,&#xD;
but the.servants were soon aroused and showed the&#xD;
party into the library.&#xD;
On learning their errand Mr. De Courcy came&#xD;
down in his dressing gown, and bowed coldly and&#xD;

formally to his lordship. The bishop addressed him&#xD;
immediately:&#xD;
"Sir, one of your immaculate peasantry has at-&#xD;
tempted to murder me this night."&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy unlocked his escritoire, seated&#xD;
himself, pen in hand, and, calling upon the constab-&#xD;
ulary present to act as witnesses, said to the bishop:&#xD;
"You wish to make depositions, I presume."&#xD;
" It was for that purpose I came here."&#xD;
"Haley "(to one of the policemen), "please present&#xD;
that Bible to his lordship. You will please swear&#xD;
to the truth of the statement you are going to make."&#xD;
"I can have no hesitation in doing so;" and he&#xD;
touched the book with his lips.&#xD;
He then detailed the circumstances as just related.&#xD;
"Do you think from the report was it a pistol, my&#xD;
lord, or a gun, which was fired at you?"&#xD;
"It was a gun."&#xD;
" You judge so from the report? "&#xD;
"Not that alone ; I saw the gun in the villain's&#xD;
hand."&#xD;
"Oh, you saw him, then?"&#xD;
"Yes; most distinctly.  I saw his countenance&#xD;
fully, and looked at his profile. His face its indelibly&#xD;
fixed on my mind. There was no moon, but it was&#xD;
dusk, or darkish twilight."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Do you know who he is?"&#xD;
"No; the scoundrel is a stranger to me."&#xD;
"Have you reason to suspect anyone, my lord "&#xD;
" Yes, sir. You well know I have reason to suspect&#xD;
the whole vile crew of my tenan try, any one of whom&#xD;
would gladly take my life; but this wretch, I pre-&#xD;
sume, is a stranger, whom they hired to murder me,&#xD;
being too cowardly to do it themselves. I have no&#xD;
doubt that it is a plot that has been long in contem&#xD;
elation."&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy turned upon him a stern look.&#xD;
"My lord, you must confine yourself to facts. I can-&#xD;
not notice your comments. This is not the place for&#xD;
them. Has your lordship any further facts to re-&#xD;
late ? "&#xD;
"c NO."&#xD;
The deposition having been duly read over, wit-&#xD;
nessed, and signed, his lordship and guard took their&#xD;
departure.&#xD;
As Mr. De Courcy sat at breakfast next morning&#xD;
with his family, he was surprised to see the bishop's&#xD;
carriage stopping at the door, and his lordship and&#xD;
guard alighting from it. He received them in the&#xD;
library as before.&#xD;
"I have come, sir, to make a new statement,"&#xD;
said Biggs.&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy again opened his escritoire, and&#xD;
prepared to write.&#xD;
"I was so confused last night from excitement,"&#xD;
proceeded his lordship, " that I could not recollect&#xD;
who my intended murderer was; but when alone in&#xD;
the silence of my chamber since I recalled his fea-&#xD;
tures, and remembered him to be a man whom I&#xD;
ejected from my land some few years ago. He has&#xD;
been prowling about this neighborhood ever since,&#xD;
as a laborer. His,.name is Dempsey-Bryan Demp-&#xD;
sey."&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy fixed a scrutinizing look upon the&#xD;
bishop as he uttered these words, and demanded-&#xD;
"My lord, have you been drinking strong liquors&#xD;
since I took your deposition?"&#xD;
" Certainly not."&#xD;
"Do you remember you swore point blank, in the&#xD;
presence of witnesses, that you had a perfect view&#xD;
of the man's face, that his countenance was indeli-&#xD;
bly fixed on your mind, and that he was a stranger&#xD;
to you? "&#xD;
)" Yes; but I recalled his features since."&#xD;
" And you would now swear that what you swore&#xD;
a few hours ago was untrue ?"&#xD;
"I tell you I recollected his features since.&#xD;
Mr. I)e Courcy closed his escritoire.&#xD;
&#xD;
"My lord bishop, I must remind'you I am a mag-&#xD;
istrate, and not accustomed to allow any man to&#xD;
treat me with indignity."&#xD;
"Then you refuse to take my deposition ? "&#xD;
"Most decidedly. You must go elsewhere with&#xD;
your trifling; it will receive no toleration from me."&#xD;
He departed, foaming with i-age, and betook him-&#xD;
self to Margin, in whom he found a willing tool.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
IT was two o'clock in the cottage of Bryan Demp-&#xD;
soy. He and Winnie, with their three youngest&#xD;
children, had just sat down to dinner-the two&#xD;
older ones were at school in Tinmanogue with Mr.&#xD;
Rafferty.&#xD;
One little girl of four years sat beside her father,&#xD;
who peeled her potatoes and divided his attentions&#xD;
between her and a blooming little fellow of two&#xD;
years, who sat opposite, beside his mother. Winnie&#xD;
held the bby-a fine infant of five months-on her&#xD;
lap, and fed it and herself together.&#xD;
Winnie still looked very young and pretty, and&#xD;
was always neat and tidy in her person and house.&#xD;
Their little cottage contained but two rooms. The&#xD;
inner one, which you caught a glimpse of through&#xD;
the half-open door, contained a good old-fashioned&#xD;
bed, with curtains of dark chintz and fringed pillow-&#xD;
slip. -Beside it was a kneeling-chair, or Prie Dieu,'&#xD;
of painted wood.  Those were the gifts of her&#xD;
mother to Winnie on her marriage.&#xD;
Over this chair, suspended on the wall, hung&#xD;
&#xD;
several little framed pictures around a large-sized&#xD;
one of the Crucifixion, which formed a centre-piece.&#xD;
Our Blessed Lady repairing. a child's garment, St.&#xD;
Joseph planing a board, and the Divine Infant be-&#xD;
tween both, crumbling with his tiny fingers a piece&#xD;
of bread among a group of little chickens, formed&#xD;
the subject of one of the small pictures-rudely ex-&#xD;
ecuted, but exquisitely touching in design; Another&#xD;
was the infant St. John carrying a lamb bigger&#xD;
than himself. A third was St. Patrick, dressed in&#xD;
full pontificals, standing in a commanding attitude&#xD;
with his finger pointing to the ocean, while a whole&#xD;
crowd of snakes, toads, and serpents, bounded or&#xD;
crawled as quickly as they could into the foaming&#xD;
waves, apparently very glad to escape from his for-&#xD;
midable-looking crozier. A fourth was St. Bridget,&#xD;
wrapt in meditation before, her inextinguishable fire&#xD;
in the "Holy Fane of Kildare."&#xD;
A font of white delf hung close to the bed's head&#xD;
containing holy water, and a .rosary hanging upon&#xD;
it completed the spiritual ornaments.  The re-&#xD;
mainder of the furniture was humble but comforta-&#xD;
ble.&#xD;
In the outer room or kitchen the ample fire-place&#xD;
had its usual pile of blazing turf.&#xD;
Before this fire Bryan and Winnie were now eat.&#xD;

ing their mid-day meal, as it is called, though it was&#xD;
two o'clock, the hour when all the laboring people&#xD;
take their dinner;&#xD;
Opposite the front door of the cottage was another&#xD;
door leading to the little garden and potatoe&#xD;
patch. A short partition protruded a little from&#xD;
this door, which hid from observation a settle bed&#xD;
tliatcaine down at night and accommodated the lit-&#xD;
tle boys with a sleeping apartment, and folded up&#xD;
in the day under a curtain effectually concealing it.&#xD;
The whole wall at this side was covered by a dresser,&#xD;
the pride of Winnie's heart, and the admiration of&#xD;
all who saw it. Here burnished tin, copper, delft,&#xD;
and china, contended for mastery. Each shelf was&#xD;
a stud y, and the coup d'oeil a mass of brilliancy per-&#xD;
fectly dazzling to took upon.&#xD;
in a nook near by was an alarm clock, which kept&#xD;
time to perfection, and two shelves containing their&#xD;
limited library.&#xD;
A table white as snow stood under the window,&#xD;
and chairs white as the table were disposed around&#xD;
the apartment.&#xD;
Over the fire-place was a portrait of a burly look-&#xD;
ing gentleman with a massive head, good humored&#xD;
face, and twinkling eye, dressed in a coat of bright&#xD;
green-while a scroll in his hand labeled " Repeal"&#xD;
&#xD;
told plainly as possible that it was the portrait of&#xD;
the renowned Daniel O'Connell, Esq., M. P. Beside&#xD;
this picture was another of a lady dressed in the&#xD;
height of fashion sitting before a looking-glass, giv-&#xD;
ing, as we may suppose, the last finishing touch to&#xD;
her complexion, when she discovers, reflected in the&#xD;
looking-glass, the figure of a great gaunt skeleton&#xD;
close beside her, leaning on a scythe of very ex-&#xD;
tensive dimensions. Without further ceremony lie&#xD;
informs her she has to go with him, while she, not&#xD;
at all relishing the invitation, remonstrates in most&#xD;
moving language, to which he replies in. terms more&#xD;
convincing than entertaining. The dialogue being&#xD;
printed underneath was a source of great edification&#xD;
to Bryan's visitors,- who considered it a neat and&#xD;
instructive composition.&#xD;
The outside of the cottage was literally covered&#xD;
with woodbine and Siberian honeysuckles, wherein&#xD;
Winnie displayed her early taste; and among the&#xD;
vines hung three cages, containing a lark, a gold-&#xD;
finch, and a thrush, whose combined voices kept the&#xD;
neighborhood in melodious strains " from early morn&#xD;
till set of sun."&#xD;
Winnie herself often helped the feathered song-&#xD;
sters.&#xD;
When washing or scouring off her tables and&#xD;

chairs she would rattle off " The Rakes of Kildare,''&#xD;
"Kitty's Rambles," or some other equally lively&#xD;
air ; or she would sing for the baby as a lullaby that&#xD;
beautiful old melody, " I'm asleep and don't awaken&#xD;
me," till the birds sat thoughtfully o) their perches&#xD;
and listened. It was a pleasant little home, though&#xD;
not a rich one, for peace and virtue dwelt beneath&#xD;
its roof.&#xD;
"Ah, then, Bryan," said Winnie, " did you think&#xD;
of asking Mrs. Keigan how she felt the rheumatics&#xD;
this year ?"&#xD;
"'Deed, then, it never once crost my mind."&#xD;
" Oh, shame on you, Bryan ; and you two nights&#xD;
under the same roof with .her! How in the world&#xD;
did you forget it ?"&#xD;
" Well, I didn't hear her complainin'; and then, I&#xD;
didn't think of it. Anyway she was as spry as any&#xD;
of us, around the fire every night, singin' songs and&#xD;
tellin' ghost stories-we did not go to bed era night&#xD;
till past ten o'clock."&#xD;
"Is that the work you were at? Indeed I heard&#xD;
some of John Keigan's ghost adventures before now&#xD;
and laughed till I cried again-he's the devil all out,&#xD;
at invention. Did he tell you about the night him-&#xD;
self and Pat Rourke met the big buck goat down&#xD;
by Kitturnen church-yard ?",&#xD;

".Did he? Ha, ha, ha, ha! Sure I thought my&#xD;
sides would split. Pershume to you, for one John--&#xD;
every time I think of it I have to go off. Ha, ha, ha,&#xD;
ha ! The laugh was contagious, for Winnie thre w&#xD;
back her head in a kink, while the baby kicked and&#xD;
crowed, and the other little ones laughed uproar-&#xD;
iously.&#xD;
Winnie wiped her eyes in her apron and was just&#xD;
resuming her dinner when a shadow crossed the&#xD;
open door and a constable entered the cottage.&#xD;
Alas for poor Winnie and her little ones! That&#xD;
shadow was the most woeful that ever fell upon&#xD;
their lives. Long did the memory of that heartfelt&#xD;
laugh of poor Bryan's ring through the pleasant cot-&#xD;
tage, now. dark forevermore-that laugh, so indica-&#xD;
tive of a peaceful conscience, for truly does the poet&#xD;
sing:&#xD;
"I never heard a hearty laugh&#xD;
Come out a vinlain's throat."&#xD;
At sight of the constable Winnie turned pale as&#xD;
death.. She had never seen one, since their eviction&#xD;
from their farm, without an inward ejaculation ; and&#xD;
now again the baneful shadow stood within their&#xD;
home and all strength left her.&#xD;
Bryan, though he had as little love for the genus&#xD;
as Winnie, was too mindful of his hospitable&#xD;
duties, and possessed too much of that inborn refine-&#xD;

mnent so remarkable in all Irishmen-from the hum.&#xD;
blest peasant in his cot to the lord in his palace-to&#xD;
appear embarrassed, nor did he feel so in reality, for&#xD;
his soul was guiltless.&#xD;
"God save you, honest man !" he cried cheerfully;&#xD;
"wont you sit and take share of our meal? It'&#xD;
is not much, but it's the best we have, and you're&#xD;
kindly welcome to it."&#xD;
"Thank you, no ! Does Bryan Dempsey live&#xD;
here?"&#xD;
" Bedad he does, sure enough ; that's my name,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
"You will have to come with me to Mr. Margin's&#xD;
office."&#xD;
"Mr. Margin's office'? I think there must be&#xD;
some mistake. I have no dealings with Mr. Margin,&#xD;
nor hadn't for years."&#xD;
"Didn't you hear the news, Mr. Dempsey? "&#xD;
" No, sir; I heard no news."&#xD;
"The lord bishop of Glengoulah was shot at last&#xD;
night.&#xD;
"Good God! was lie though ? And is he killed?"&#xD;
"No. He had a narrow escape of death."&#xD;
" Thank God! I'm glad the unlucky old sinner&#xD;
wasn't killed in his sins."&#xD;
The constable eyed him narrowly.&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
"They think you know something about it, Demp-&#xD;
" Me, sir? Oh, bedad; you're jokin' now in earnest,&#xD;
If he wasn't to die till I'd shoot him, he'd be a&#xD;
long-lived man ; and don't they know who done it?"&#xD;
"I can't tell yet; but I was ordered to bring you&#xD;
to Margin's office. If you feel you are innocent, you&#xD;
can't object to come witli me."&#xD;
" Oh, sorra an objection I have. I wasn't even at&#xD;
home since last Tuesday. I was eight miles from&#xD;
here at a cousin's of my own, diggin' their potatoes.&#xD;
I'm only in town since nine o'clock this morning ,&#xD;
God be praised!"&#xD;
"Well, my good man, you can state all this on&#xD;
your examination; it is useless to tell me." It is&#xD;
evident the constable was prepossessed in favor of&#xD;
the man from his transparent honesty. Bryan arose&#xD;
and took his hat. Winnie had not uttered a word&#xD;
since the constable came in, but sat with lips apart&#xD;
and dilated eye-balls, catching every word that fell&#xD;
from him. Now, that she saw her loved husband&#xD;
about to depart with him, an undefined sense&#xD;
of harm to come took possession of her mind,&#xD;
and restored to her a momentary strength. She&#xD;
started wildly from her seat, hurriedly laid her baby&#xD;
in its cradle, and clasping him frantically in her&#xD;

Don't go near them. Don't you know that villainous&#xD;
Biggs thirsts for my father's blood? and seeing' him&#xD;
beyond his reach, he will murder him through you!&#xD;
Darlin' of my heart, he will never let you out of his&#xD;
clutches, and your poor Winnie will see you no&#xD;
more! Oh, God pity me ! Bryan, don't go near&#xD;
them blood-hounds; they're on your track! I see it&#xD;
all before me; your innocence wont save you with&#xD;
them-they don't care for guilt or innocence; they&#xD;
want the poor man's blood, and little trouble they'll&#xD;
take to find out the truth so as they have the victim 1 "&#xD;
"'Winnie, my poor colleen !" said Bryan, tenderly.&#xD;
"Don't let your fears make you spake so foolish.&#xD;
Don't you know there's law in the land? and it's&#xD;
against common sense to think they can swear&#xD;
away my life, when I have plenty to prove I was&#xD;
eight miles from the place where they say the crime&#xD;
was committed ! Nonsense, Winnie! have sense.&#xD;
I'll be home. wid you to-night, or to-morrow at&#xD;
furthest, please God."&#xD;
" Oh Bryan, my own true husband!" and Winnie&#xD;
wept convulsively on his breast. The children all&#xD;
commenced screaming as they saw their mother cry.,&#xD;
Poor Bryan went from one to another, embraced&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
MANY of the neighbors had gathered in when&#xD;
they heard the cries and saw Bryan Dempsey in the&#xD;
company of a constable. Curses, heavy and deep,&#xD;
were unsparingly bestowed upon "Biggs, and the&#xD;
whole crew of murdherin' thieves." The shadow&#xD;
of a doubt of Bryan's innocence never crossed the&#xD;
mind of one individual; he had not an euiemy on&#xD;
earth but the wretches in whose presence lie was&#xD;
about to stand, nor did even they hate him person-&#xD;
ally; he was but a tool used for the maintenance of&#xD;
the sordid landed interest. When he arrived 'at&#xD;
Margin's a posse of policemen were waiting to con-&#xD;
vey him to the castle, in the hall of which' were&#xD;
assembled some country people and several magis-&#xD;
trates. Margin, taking Dempsey by the shoulder,&#xD;
placed him  among about twenty country people,&#xD;
and then proceeded with the farce of an exanina-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Now, my lord, cast your eyes-over. yondei&#xD;
crowd and see if you can recognize your intended&#xD;
murderer."&#xD;

" Yes; I see him there among the crowd. It is&#xD;
Bryan Dempsey. He is the man who knocked me&#xD;
down with a horse-pistol. I now recognize him&#xD;
fully; he repeated the blow five or six times. I&#xD;
struggled with him, and knocked him down once."&#xD;
A warrant was issued immediatelyfor the arrest&#xD;
and imprisonment of Bryan Dempsey in Ardmore&#xD;
jail. Before night people of wealth and position&#xD;
offered any amount of bail for the temporary release&#xD;
of Bryan until the day of trial, but no bail would be&#xD;
taken.&#xD;
It would be vain to attempt describing the an-&#xD;
guish of poor Winnie, although she was surrounded&#xD;
by that sympathizing charity so abundant in the&#xD;
Irish heart for those in misfortune. One of the&#xD;
neighbors had started off for her parents and soon&#xD;
she had her loved family about her, but their very&#xD;
presence seemed to make her miss. him  more. She&#xD;
would start every moment, thinking she heard his&#xD;
step, or the sound of his voice, and going to the door&#xD;
would strain her eyes wildly down the Ardmore&#xD;
road, and return moaning bitterly, exclaiming, "Oh,&#xD;
no! no! My heart's life, you'll never come that road&#xD;
again !"  To reason with her was vain. She said&#xD;
her heart told her the face of Bryan Dempsey would&#xD;
never more be seen alive in their little home.&#xD;

Father Esmond, now bent by age and iifumities,&#xD;
was confined to his bed by a severe attack of asthma.&#xD;
When he heard of the arrest of Bryan Dempsey fom&#xD;
such a crime he iminmediately sent Father O'Tool&#xD;
to offer every consolation in his power to his afflicted&#xD;
children. He had known both from childhood,&#xD;
aid well knew they would not injure the humblest&#xD;
of God's creatures. Perhaps, of all the tenantry&#xD;
evicted four years ago from 'the Glengoulah estates,&#xD;
the one who murmured least was poor Bryan-not&#xD;
that he suffered less than others, for he had an old&#xD;
grandmother who was over ninety years, and was&#xD;
bed-ridden for five years before; and lie had a father&#xD;
who was stone blind, not to speak of his young wife&#xD;
and three children, to all of whom he was devotedly&#xD;
attached-but his nature was of that cheery, hope-&#xD;
ful character which always looks at the bright side&#xD;
of the picture, and his song was ever of "the good&#xD;
time coming."  Even now in his prison cell, though&#xD;
he chafed over it when alone, he ever spoke cheer-&#xD;
fully to his friends, especially to Winnie, telling her&#xD;
pleasantly she was a little goose to be making a&#xD;
sprinkling-pot of her eyes, for he would be soon at&#xD;
home with her, rocking the .cradle,, and smoking in&#xD;
the chimney corner. He did really believe so him-&#xD;
self; and how could he think otherwise?-&#xD;

He was arrested on the 19th of November, and&#xD;
remained in prison until the following January, when&#xD;
a special commission was appointed to try the case.&#xD;
For the benefit of those who are unacquainted with&#xD;
the customs relating to the trial of prisoners in Ire.&#xD;
land, I may as well state that there are two general&#xD;
assizes held throughout the country-one in spring&#xD;
and one in summer-at each of which two judges&#xD;
preside, one to try civil and the other criminal cases.&#xD;
All minor offenders are disposed of at the quarter&#xD;
sessions held in each county town. If, hoevr tlie&#xD;
crime be of a very aggravated character, and the&#xD;
country in such a state of disturbance as to alarm&#xD;
the peaceably disposed, the loyal gentry convene a&#xD;
meeting and petition the chief governor, or lord&#xD;
lieutenant, as lie .is called,'to order a special coin-&#xD;
mission to be held, in order to strike terror into the&#xD;
evil doers. This is a very expensive proceeding, and,&#xD;
as the tax for its payment is levied off the county, it&#xD;
is always a very unpopular one, and only resorted to&#xD;
in cases of the niost urgent necessity. The present&#xD;
case was deemed one of that nature. The person of&#xD;
a dignitary of the Church by law established had&#xD;
been murderously assailed, and the inviolability of&#xD;
the whole landlord class had been struck at through&#xD;
him. Such a state of things was not to be borne.&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
A great meeting of the landed interest was held at&#xD;
Ardmore, and a deputation sent to Dublin Castle,&#xD;
praying his excellency to appoint a special commis-&#xD;
sion to try Byran Dempsey, as it was essential to&#xD;
strike terror into all evil disposed tenants. Accord-&#xD;
iungly the commission was appointed, to be opened&#xD;
on Tuesday, January 20th, 1846.*&#xD;
The court opened at eleven o'clock A. M., when the&#xD;
chief justice of common pleas and the chief baron of&#xD;
the exchequer took their seats on the bench.: The&#xD;
town was crowded from, an early hour by people&#xD;
from all parts of the surrounding counties, who were&#xD;
most anxious about the result of the proceedings.&#xD;
An immense number of constabulary were col-&#xD;
lected in the town, both horse and foot. Notwith-&#xD;
standing the declaration of the landlords that the&#xD;
country was plunged in agrarian outrages, the only&#xD;
case of any importance on the calendar was that of&#xD;
firing at the Right Reverend Bishop Biggs, of Glen-&#xD;
goulah Castle.&#xD;
A large number of Catholic clergy of the sur-&#xD;
rounding districts were present during the trial.&#xD;
The court was thronged from  an early hour by the&#xD;
gentry of the county. A vast number-in fact all&#xD;

the jurors of the county-were summoned, and a very&#xD;
full attendance of both grand and petit jurors was&#xD;
the result-&#xD;
When the writ of commission was read by the&#xD;
clerk of the crown the long jury panel was called,&#xD;
and a number of gentlemen sworn in on the grand&#xD;
jury.  The chief justice of common pleas then&#xD;
charged them. He said: "Gentlemen of the grand&#xD;
jury, I very much regret that the state .of this&#xD;
county has been such for the last five months as to&#xD;
render it expedient for you to assemble at this unui-&#xD;
sual period, and within a few weeks of your being&#xD;
impanelled at the approaching assizes. On looking,&#xD;
however, at the official return of the outrages that&#xD;
have been perpetrated since the last assizes, I am&#xD;
not surprised that those who naturally feel the deep=&#xD;
est interest in the,-welfare of this county should&#xD;
endeavor speedily to put an end to this state. of&#xD;
things, and by a prompt administration of the law&#xD;
to overawe the disturbers of the public peace, and&#xD;
to afford security and protection to the unoffending&#xD;
and industrious, and to restore tranquillity and order.&#xD;
Gentlemen, it is not my intention to enlarge on the&#xD;
disastrous consequences which would result from&#xD;
permitting your county to remain any longer in the&#xD;
state in which it unhappily has been for some&#xD;

I'&#xD;

months past. I purposely and studiously abstain&#xD;
from doitg so, because I am anxious to avoid advert&#xD;
ing to any- topic calculated to inflame or disturb&#xD;
that calmness with which it is so desirable that all&#xD;
who take part in the administration of the criminal&#xD;
law should approach the discharge of their solemn&#xD;
duties. Gentlemen, from the experience I have so&#xD;
frequently.had of the manner in which you discharge&#xD;
your duties as grand jurors, I feel that you do not&#xD;
require any explanation or instruction from the&#xD;
court. I have the fullest reliance on the intelligence&#xD;
and intention with which you will proceed in the&#xD;
examination of the different charges which will be&#xD;
brought before you. You will not, I am satisfied,&#xD;
suffer any indignation at the outrages that have been&#xD;
committed, to excite a prejudice' in your minds&#xD;
when you are weighing the evidence against each&#xD;
individual accused; and, however those who have&#xD;
been engaged in the offences which we deplore may&#xD;
have insulted and violated the laws, I hope we shall&#xD;
let them see that those laws will be administered on&#xD;
the present occasion not more for the detection and&#xD;
punishment of the guilty than for the protection and&#xD;
safety of the innocent, or even those with respect to&#xD;
whose guilt there can exist a rational doubt. With&#xD;
these few observations I shall dismiss you for the&#xD;

be laid before you."&#xD;
The grand jury then retired. Bills were sent be-&#xD;
fore them, and immediately""a true bill "  f&#xD;
a.ru. ill was fonnd&#xD;
against Dempsey for shooting at Bishop Biggs.&#xD;
Dempsey was then placed at the bar. The indictment&#xD;
contained twelve counts. After twenty challenges&#xD;
on the part of the prisoner a jury was sworn.&#xD;
The clerk of the crown, having read over an ab-&#xD;
stract of the usual indictment, asked the usual ques-&#xD;
tion. The prisoner in a finn voice pleaded "not&#xD;
guilty."  The long jury panel was then called over,&#xD;
and eighty-four gentlemen answered to their names.&#xD;
A jury was selected from them, four of whom were&#xD;
magistrates.&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
BRYAN DEMPsEY was indicted in the usual form:&#xD;
"For that he, on the 18th day of November, not&#xD;
having the fear of. God before his eyes, aided by&#xD;
some person unknown, unlawfully and maliciously&#xD;
did cut and wound the Right iRev. Samuel Wilson&#xD;
Biggs, Lord Bishop of Glengoulah, and Ardmore,&#xD;
with the intent to kill and murder him," etc. The&#xD;
attorney-general then arose and said: "It appeared&#xD;
to him to be a case where all the witnesses should be&#xD;
removed from the court."&#xD;
Chief Barom-" Very well; let all the witnesses&#xD;
withdraw ; if they remain they will be fined."&#xD;
The witnesses accordingly retired.&#xD;
The attorney-general proceeded to state the case.&#xD;
He said: " From the abstract of the indictment&#xD;
which they (the jury) had heard read, they would be&#xD;
able to understand the general nature of the offence&#xD;
with which the prisoner at the bar, Bryan Dempsey,&#xD;
stood charged before them. It was one of many&#xD;
cases which unfortunately had occurred in the county&#xD;
in a short period, and which disgraced it. From the&#xD;

nature and number of these offences it was deemed&#xD;
expedient to call the county together on this very&#xD;
extraordinary occasion, with a hope that by a&#xD;
prompt and effective administration of the law&#xD;
the progress of such crimes might be arrested. It&#xD;
was thought necessary to issue a special commission&#xD;
in order to investigate the case now before them-a&#xD;
case in which the evidence appeared to him to be of&#xD;
so clear and satisfactory a nature as to warrant an&#xD;
expectation that the perpetrators of the offence would&#xD;
be brought to speedy justice. The present case was&#xD;
of that class for most, and the crown did not call on&#xD;
the jury for a verdict unless the evidence was of that&#xD;
nature to render it clear: He was sure the jury&#xD;
would give the matter their fullest consideration, and&#xD;
unless the evidence for the crown was much shaken&#xD;
with regard to truth, they would find a verdict of&#xD;
guilty. Of course, if they had any reasonable doubt&#xD;
of the guilt of the prisoner, they would give it to him,&#xD;
and find a verdict of not guilty." He then pro.&#xD;
ceeded to call the witnesses. The first witness&#xD;
called was the Lord Bishop Biggs, who was exam-&#xD;
ined by Sergeant Poker.&#xD;
"I live atiGlengoulah Castle, in this county, four&#xD;
miles from Ardmore. I recollect the 18th of Novem-&#xD;
ber last, and went out to dinner at 7 o'clock in a&#xD;

small carriage driven by an English servant.' I&#xD;
dined at Colonel Dickson's, and left it at 25 minutes&#xD;
past 12 o'clock. I suppose there were about twenty&#xD;
persons at the party. I was perfectly sober. There&#xD;
was no moon, but it was dusk or darkish twilight.&#xD;
I got out of the carriage in the avenue, and walked&#xD;
up to the hall door. I then walked up the steps, rang&#xD;
the bell, and when turning around heard a shot and&#xD;
saw the smoke. I saw a man, who ran. I followed&#xD;
him, and in the.distance of about thirty yards came&#xD;
up with him. There is a bank there, and I fell;&#xD;
the man fell also. I got up, saw him with a gun,&#xD;
seized it, and then throttled him. I saw his counte-&#xD;
nance full, and looked at his profile. The man's face&#xD;
is indelibly imprinted on my mind. I took hold of&#xD;
him, looked over my shoulder, and saw a second&#xD;
man. I let go the first, and the second, presented a&#xD;
pistol at me. lie pulled the trigger, but fortunately&#xD;
it did not go off. I knocked him down with my&#xD;
left hand, and struggled with him. The second man&#xD;
knocked me down, and repeated the blow five or six&#xD;
times. The blow was with a horse-pistol. I cried&#xD;
out 'Help.' The hall door was opened ; and when a&#xD;
light was brought, the man ran away. I saw the&#xD;
man the next day, and see him now in the dock-it&#xD;
is Dempsey. I know him for eight years.' He was&#xD;

a tenant of mine, and was evicted about fort years&#xD;
ago. He was a peaceable tenant. When I dis&#xD;
possessed him I promised to get him another farm&#xD;
and pay a year's rent for it. He never said he was&#xD;
dissatisfied. When I seized him he had no hat on&#xD;
--the hat he used to wear had a peculiar cut, and&#xD;
any one would know it. I saw it at Glengoulali&#xD;
next morning-it is the same he used to wear be-&#xD;
fore. I saw a coat next morning-it was the pris-&#xD;
oner's. I got five wounds in the head, and Dr.&#xD;
Ferguson attended me in an hour. I took means&#xD;
next morning to have the party arrested."&#xD;
Court-" Did you communicate the name to any&#xD;
one ?"&#xD;
Prisoner's counsel objected, but the court allowed&#xD;
the question to be put, and witness replied:&#xD;
" I described the person, and in consequence the&#xD;
prisoner was arrested (identified the hat and coat).&#xD;
That is like the hat the prisoner always wore when&#xD;
I saw him."&#xD;
Counsel-" You swore two informations next morn-&#xD;
ing?&#xD;
"Yes. Can't say I mentioned about the hat."&#xD;
Counsel handed the witness one of the informa-&#xD;
tions and told him to read it, which he did, and&#xD;
said: " There is nothing about a hat in this."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
269&#xD;
&#xD;
"Read the second information."&#xD;
"There is nothing about a hat in this either. I&#xD;
swore the second information after I remembered it&#xD;
was Bryan Dempsey who had fired at me. I know&#xD;
him for years, and saw him the following afternoon,&#xD;
about five o'clock, at Glengoulah, when he was&#xD;
brought into the hall. There were. several mnagis-&#xD;
trates there, and several country people also. There&#xD;
was only one man among them that I recognized.&#xD;
They put Dempsey among the. country people.&#xD;
Don't know what magistrate did that. Thomas Sel-&#xD;
ling, my butler, gave me the hat. I don't know if&#xD;
he is in town at present. The sergeant of police&#xD;
showed me the coat. I think I saw it in his hands&#xD;
first the following day at foe o'clocA. The butler&#xD;
gave me the hat in the morning. I did not see the&#xD;
coat- until five o'clock. Don't know what the ser-&#xD;
geant has sworn to now, if he has sworn at all. I&#xD;
have heard that he did swear an information. I&#xD;
have no means of knowing the fact. I don't know&#xD;
if lie is to be a witness here. I don't know if Con-&#xD;
stable Dougherty has sworn an information. I nev-&#xD;
er heard his name before. Never heard- there was&#xD;
a joint information sworn by the constables. Did&#xD;
not speak to the sergeant about the hat. Sergeant&#xD;
heard me say I knew the-coat. Dempsey was my&#xD;

&#xD;
tenant, and surrendered his farm peaceably. We&#xD;
parted apparently good friends. I don't know where&#xD;
the coat is. It was twenty minutes to one when I&#xD;
came home on the night in question. I had no rea-&#xD;
son to complain of the prisoner's character or con-&#xD;
duct while my tenant. If he had had capital, I&#xD;
would have continued him. I never heard any&#xD;
complaint against him."&#xD;
Three servants of Lord Biggs were examined to&#xD;
prove the finding of the hat and coat near the scene&#xD;
of the attack. Two policemen and Sandy McGlau-&#xD;
ren swore positively the hat belonged to Dempsey.&#xD;
Mr. Clements, Q. C., then addressed the jury on&#xD;
behalf of the prisoner. He dwelt much on the quiet,&#xD;
peaceable character given of him by the landlord&#xD;
himself, who declared he never appeared dissatisfied,&#xD;
nor grumbled at his being ejected, all which tended&#xD;
to prove he could have no motive for perpetrating&#xD;
the crime laid to his' charge. He said the whole&#xD;
case rested on the evidence of identification given&#xD;
by his lordship, who had an opportunity of seeing&#xD;
the person only in the dark and dead hour of night,&#xD;
after coniing from a party. The bishop swore an&#xD;
information next morning, but the name of the&#xD;
prisoner he never mentioned (he here read the in-&#xD;
formation). Would they credit an humble peasant&#xD;
&#xD;
270&#xD;
&#xD;
271&#xD;
&#xD;
who would swear such an information ? The pris-&#xD;
oner was a tenant of the bishop, and did he in his&#xD;
information ever state that Dempsey was the man&#xD;
who fired at' him? i His lordship had made a mis-&#xD;
take; and he (Mr. Clements) was prepared to prove&#xD;
it. With reference to the evidence given by the&#xD;
policeman, it was painful to witness the exhibition&#xD;
made there that day. If human lives were to de-&#xD;
pend on such evidence as that given by them no&#xD;
man in society would be safe. They never had the&#xD;
hat in their hands and only saw it once, but when&#xD;
or where they could not tell; and yet the jury were&#xD;
called on to take away the life of the prisoner at the&#xD;
baron the proof of identity of a peasant's hat! God&#xD;
forbid people's lives should depend on such.evidence,&#xD;
or that a jury could be found to convict a man of&#xD;
capital felony on such swearing ! It was even six&#xD;
days after the prisoner was arrested that the informa&#xD;
tions were sworn by the policemen and land-steward&#xD;
about the hat. He would ask them, as honest, con-&#xD;
scientious men, could they find a verdict against the&#xD;
prisoner. He would now proceed to give proofs&#xD;
which would save the prisoner's life, without even&#xD;
the shadow of a doubt as to his guilt. He would&#xD;
account for the prisoner on that night by persons of&#xD;
respectability, and beyond doubt. The evidence&#xD;

that would be given was, that the prisoner, after&#xD;
leaving his farm, took potato ground from his uncle,&#xD;
a man named Keigan, and a most respectable farmer.&#xD;
On the Monday before the outrage the prisoner went&#xD;
to dig his potatoes, and was asleep eight miles away&#xD;
from Glengoulah at the time the bishop was attacked.&#xD;
He would now prove his case.&#xD;
Bridget Keigan swore that on the night of the&#xD;
attack Dempsey slept at her house. She saw himn&#xD;
at ten o'clock on the Monday night, and after lock-&#xD;
ing the doors went to bed.  On getting up next&#xD;
morning she found them still locked as she left them&#xD;
The prisoner came down stairs with her son some&#xD;
time after. lie slept there on Tuesday night also.&#xD;
Glengoulah is eight miles from where Mrs. Keigan&#xD;
lives. Mary and Catharine Keigan, daughters of&#xD;
the last witness, corroborated her statement in every&#xD;
particular.&#xD;
John Keigan examined: -Remembers the time&#xD;
Bishop Biggs was fired at, and when the prisoner&#xD;
was arrested. Gave the same account of the tran-&#xD;
sactions mentioned by the other witnesses. He&#xD;
said the prisoner slept with him on Monday ni'ht&#xD;
and on Tuesday night.   The witness got upon&#xD;
Tuesday morning at daylight, and the prisoner got&#xD;
up also.&#xD;
&#xD;
.ir. Gordon-" On your oath, from the time you&#xD;
went to bed on Monday night, until you got up, did&#xD;
Bryan Dempsey leave the room?"&#xD;
" He did not leave the room that night, nor could&#xD;
not without my knowing it. I was never at Glen-&#xD;
goulah Castle, but I know where it is. It is eight&#xD;
miles from my father's; and a person going there&#xD;
must either go that distance, or fly -across the lake."&#xD;
Some other witnesses were examined, but their&#xD;
evidence was totally void of public interest.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
THE Reverend Father Esmond, though gasping&#xD;
with asthma, and leaning for support upon the arin&#xD;
of Mr. De Courcy, arose and gave a very high char-&#xD;
acter to the prisoner, having known him from child-&#xD;
hood. He said: "Iis filial piety to a blind father&#xD;
and a paralyzed grandmother were the admiration&#xD;
of all who knew him. When a mere stripling he&#xD;
was deprived by death of a mother's care, and yet&#xD;
he seemed to cling with all the more tenderness, and&#xD;
a gentleness almost feminine, to the infirm beings&#xD;
whom Heaven had left dependent on his youthful&#xD;
care. For many years he was seen, by hundreds&#xD;
now listening, every Sunday at the chapel of Tin-&#xD;
manogue, lifting his helpless parents from the car in&#xD;
which he brought them, and tenderly supporting&#xD;
them to the seat provided for them near the altar.&#xD;
This attention he never slackened, even when he&#xD;
became a husband and a father, or when evicted&#xD;
from his farm and placed in altered circumstances&#xD;
-never until he laid them respectfully to rest among&#xD;
their kindred dead. I have watched him too in&#xD;
&#xD;
the relation of husband, father, neighbor, friend--&#xD;
in all he has been the true man; upright, honest,&#xD;
brave, high-principled. At the time when he was&#xD;
evicted from his farm, when the fire was quenched&#xD;
from his hearth, and his helpless parents carried out&#xD;
in torrents of rain, almost on the eve of Christmas-&#xD;
I was an eye-witness of it all-the only tongue that&#xD;
uttered no unkind word was that of Bryan Demp-&#xD;
sey. He actually endeavored to turn their misfor-&#xD;
tunes into a subject of merriment, trying to infuse a&#xD;
spirit of cheerfulness and hope into the hearts he&#xD;
loved-a -spirit which I well knew lie did not him-&#xD;
self feel; but Bryan Dempsey was a stranger to self--&#xD;
he lived only in those he loved. Had I a hundred&#xD;
lives, I would stake all this moment on the inno-&#xD;
cence of Bryan Dempsey. 'He never lifted a land&#xD;
to injure any man; nay, I verily believe he never&#xD;
harbored an injurious thought of his greatest enemy.&#xD;
This virtuous man, gentlemen, is a very humble one&#xD;
in the eyes ofA the world, but very dear to the heart&#xD;
of his Heavenly Father. See you touch not a hair&#xD;
of his head !" The venerable old man became so ex-&#xD;
cited during his brief speech that his eyes flashed&#xD;
and his face glowed, while tears streamed down his&#xD;
aged cheeks. At the conclusion of his speech sobs&#xD;
and cries attested the deep feeling which touched&#xD;
&#xD;
.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC7337-00000143"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
every heart. Even the very wretches who thirsted&#xD;
for the blood of this virtuous peasant remained si-&#xD;
lent for some time for very shame. The gallant&#xD;
prisoner, who bore himself so bravely all through,&#xD;
was so overcome by the noble testimony borne by&#xD;
his venerable friend and spiritual father that he&#xD;
leaned over the dock and sobbed like an infant. Mr.&#xD;
De Courcy then arose, remarking "that it would&#xD;
be superfluous to add another word to the testimony&#xD;
of Father Esmnonci regarding g the prisoner's character,&#xD;
in every sentence of which he concurred, having&#xD;
known Dempsey since he was a baby in his mother's&#xD;
arms." This closed the defence.&#xD;
Sergeant Babbett then proceeded to'reply on the&#xD;
part of the crown. His observations were confined to&#xD;
the evidence.&#xD;
At nine o'clock the chief baron proceeded to sum&#xD;
up the evidence, which lie did by reading the testi-&#xD;
mony given by the witnesses, and offering a few&#xD;
brief observations as lie went along. The jury then&#xD;
retired.&#xD;
At half-past ten they came out and said there was&#xD;
little probability of their agreeing, and asked for a&#xD;
fire and their coats.&#xD;
Bailiffs were then sworn, and the court adjourned&#xD;
to eight o'clock in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Oh ! what a night of anguish for that virtuous&#xD;
family--the alternate feelings of hope and despair&#xD;
which scorched their souls! None, thought of sleep,&#xD;
and many of the neighbors came to watch with&#xD;
them. The chief baron said if the jury agreed be-&#xD;
fore twelve o'clock he would come and receive the&#xD;
verdict. At eight o'clock on Wednesday morning&#xD;
his lordship sent to know if the jury had agreed,&#xD;
but was answered. in the negative. It may be~'e-&#xD;
marked here that the jury panel contained the&#xD;
names of every gentleman wko had signed the retusi-&#xD;
tion for the issuing of this commission.&#xD;
At -ten o'clock on Wednesday the chief justice&#xD;
of the common pleas and the chief baron took&#xD;
their seats on the bench, when the jury were called&#xD;
into court.&#xD;
ChiefBaron-" Well, gentlemen, have you agreed&#xD;
to your verdict?"&#xD;
Foreman-" No, my lord; we have not."&#xD;
" Is there any likelihood of your agreeing?"&#xD;
"Not the least, my lord."&#xD;
" Under these circumstances, gentlemen, you must&#xD;
again retire to your room. There is no alternative;&#xD;
we have no discretion in the matter."&#xD;
" My lord, there is not the least use in our retir-&#xD;
ing again, as there is no possibility of our ever agree-&#xD;

ing. There are ten of us one way, and two another;&#xD;
so, my lord, you may be good enough to discharge&#xD;
tis, for agree we never will on this case. We are now&#xD;
twenty-four hours locked up in our room, with only&#xD;
some water for refreshment, and a very indiffer-&#xD;
ent fire, and some of us in very poor health indeed.&#xD;
Our room is more like a dungeon than anything else.&#xD;
If we are confined any longer it may seriously en-_&#xD;
danger our lives."&#xD;
" It is indeed a great hardship, gentlemen, and we&#xD;
feel very much for your situation ; but we have not&#xD;
the power, gentlemen, under the circumstances, to&#xD;
act otherwise. You must again return to your room."&#xD;
"My lord, if there was the most remote probabili-&#xD;
ty of our agreeing we would not make this applica'&#xD;
tion ; besides, wve are likely to be starved- to death&#xD;
if we are kept any longer confined."&#xD;
" It is a great hardship, no doubt, and I assure&#xD;
you we feel for your situation ; but we can do noth-&#xD;
ing. You must again retire, gentlemen."&#xD;
Chief Justice-" We feel conscious of the situa-&#xD;
tion you are in, and feel very much for your position.&#xD;
Perhaps, if you look over your notes, you may come&#xD;
to some conclusion ; and if you require any assist-&#xD;
ance, the learned chief baron who tried the case will&#xD;
render you every assistance."&#xD;
&#xD;
After L short discussion the jury slowly retired,&#xD;
protesti; g they would be starved. The court or-&#xD;
dered a good fire to be put in the jury-room, which&#xD;
being c one the jury were again locked up.&#xD;
At }If-past eight o'clock P. M. the jury, not hav-&#xD;
ing ag 'eed to a verdict, were discharged, after hay-&#xD;
ing b( en locked up thirty-six hours. The attorney-&#xD;
gener Al immediately announced that he would again&#xD;
put the prisoner on his trial on the Thursday follow-&#xD;
ing. This announcement caused the utmost excite-&#xD;
ment throughout the town ; and the friends of the&#xD;
prisoner, who were very numerous ai..d respectable,&#xD;
and even the prisoner's counsel, were taken by sur-&#xD;
prise, as they did not anticipate (notwithstanding&#xD;
their declaration of readiness) a second trial of the&#xD;
prisoner at that commission.&#xD;
It was quite clear from the time the jury retired,&#xD;
that they would not agree, and the announcement&#xD;
made by the foreman, that there were ten for convic-&#xD;
tion and two not, was canvassed very freely as a&#xD;
most extraordinary intimation, and most certainly&#xD;
influenced the prosecutors to bring on the trial again.&#xD;
They determined, no doubt, to mend their hand next&#xD;
time in the selection of a willingjury, and thus se-&#xD;
cure a conviction. The general impression was that&#xD;
the prisoner would ha ve been held over until the&#xD;

Spring Assizes, when the excitement then existing&#xD;
on the subject would have ceased; but it was no part&#xD;
of the landlord plan to let reflection take the place of&#xD;
passion : a landlord was fired at, and some one must&#xD;
suffer for such a daring crime-be he guilty or in-&#xD;
nocent it did not matter" a pin's point. Assuredly&#xD;
no one could be so mad as to suppose the life of a&#xD;
peasant, however guiltless, could be compared to the&#xD;
atrocious attempt to take the life of Samuel W.&#xD;
Biggs, Lord Bishop of Glengoulah, with its castle.&#xD;
and its broad acres ! The counsel on both sides&#xD;
were in attendance at the sitting of the court. The&#xD;
building was thronged to excess, and the town&#xD;
was filled with country people to ascertain the result&#xD;
of poor Dempsey's trial. The prisoner's counsel ap-&#xD;
plied for a postponement of the case to the Assizes,&#xD;
but were refused. The most barefaced anxiety was&#xD;
expressed for a conviction, and all prudence thrown&#xD;
aside, so much so that the prisoner's most earnest&#xD;
friends gave up all hope of justice. From   the&#xD;
judges on the bench to the constables at the doors,&#xD;
all thirsted for the blood of this innocent man. The&#xD;
judge's charge, respecting the outrages so very fre-&#xD;
quent in the country, was not only magnified but&#xD;
misrepresented. On Thursday, January 31st, Bryn&#xD;
an Dempsey was tried a second time. After hearing&#xD;
&#xD;
a repetition of the evidence adduced on the first trial,&#xD;
and deliberating from eight o'clock to midnight, a&#xD;
verdict of guilty was returned by a packed jury.&#xD;
Those present in court that night will never for-&#xD;
get the scene to their dying hour. Rain fell in tor-&#xD;
rents, but the packed streets bore testimony to the&#xD;
intense anxiety of the people. The silence of the&#xD;
grave fell upon all inside as the foreman, pale and&#xD;
with trembling tongue, uttered the foul falsehood.&#xD;
The very lights seemed to flicker and blink with&#xD;
shame when the chief baron arose and expressed his&#xD;
concurrence with the verdict of the jury. Then put-&#xD;
ting on his black cap and gloves he sentenced Bryan&#xD;
Dempsey to be hanged on a day hereafter to be&#xD;
named ! The heroic prisoner received the sentence&#xD;
with the greatest self-possession and nerve. Bishop&#xD;
Biggs, arising hastily, grasped the arm of the Mar-&#xD;
quis of Eastfield, and entered into an earnest conver-&#xD;
sation with the judges. The bishop seemed terribly&#xD;
excited. Soon the crowd began to sway from side&#xD;
to side, and whispers were passed from one to an-&#xD;
other, a rush was made for the doors, and it required&#xD;
the strongest efforts of the police and military, who&#xD;
were there in great force, to keep anything like&#xD;
order. Large groups of people, with-each an im-&#xD;
promptu spokesman or two among them, were dis-&#xD;

cussing some matter which seemed to cause conflict.&#xD;
ing feelings of hope and despair.&#xD;
Soon the news spread like wildfire through tl'e town&#xD;
that a man bearing the worst description of charac&#xD;
ter-a successful evader of the law, and altogether a&#xD;
desperate ruffian-had been seen running from the&#xD;
judges to Mr. Margin's office, and from Margin's to&#xD;
the.priest's, declaring before God that lie was the man&#xD;
who fired at Bishop Biggs. He begged the judges,&#xD;
for the love of God, not to hang an innocent man,&#xD;
for that Dempsey had no hand or part in the act, nor&#xD;
did he ever belong to Captain Starlight's company.&#xD;
When questioned why lie allowed an innocent&#xD;
man to be tried for so foul a crime, lie stated "lie&#xD;
never dreamed for a moment that any jury could&#xD;
find Dempsey guilty, but if they caught him he&#xD;
would be sure to be condemned.  He declared he&#xD;
would have finished the bishop (and was very sorry&#xD;
lie did not) but that hi  lordship was so drunk when&#xD;
knocking at the hall door that he staggered from&#xD;
the knocker to the bell at the side of the door, and&#xD;
lie, firing in the interval of the slip, the ball destined&#xD;
for his lordship's body lodged in the door. He en-&#xD;
treated they would try him then,. and said lie was&#xD;
willing to die to save a just man-not in expiation&#xD;
of such an act as shooting at Biggs-that he consid~&#xD;

ered was no crime, but a virtue to rid the world of&#xD;
such a. double-dyed villain-a serpent that sucked&#xD;
the life-blood of the poor."&#xD;
Will it be believed: the whole prosecuting crew-&#xD;
judges and landlords-affected to believe him crazy,&#xD;
and recommended he should be sent to the lunatic&#xD;
assylum and have his head shorn ! Mr. De Courcy&#xD;
took this man's sworn depositions before two reliable&#xD;
witnesses. Ile then drew up the draft of a petition&#xD;
to the lord lieutenant, and lost not a moment in&#xD;
getting it numerously and most respectably signed.&#xD;
In fact every man of known worth and integrity&#xD;
was happy to sign such a memorial-even one of&#xD;
the jurors signed it. Of course the wretched bigots&#xD;
and persecuting landlords, with a few of those time-&#xD;
servers, plentiful in every country, who fancy it&#xD;
looks fashionable to be opposed to poor people,&#xD;
held aloof, or yet worse, declared against the inno-&#xD;
cent man. Be not surprised, dear reader! they were&#xD;
the Pontius Pilates of this little episode. Such exist&#xD;
in every state of society, and in every country under&#xD;
the sun. Alas ! for human respect. The fear of&#xD;
being "cut" by some little Upstart Cesar of the&#xD;
day shuts their souls to every noble sentiment, and&#xD;
extinguishes every spark ofprinciple, without which&#xD;
man is unworthy of the name !&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
SooN those legal murderers heard of the petition&#xD;
and immediately took counsel together, and appoint-&#xD;
ing a deputation started them  to Dublin. The&#xD;
viceroy was already closeted with a deputation of a&#xD;
very different character. Some half dozen gentle-&#xD;
men of high character and position, and bearing&#xD;
historic names, came to seek the god-like preroga-&#xD;
tive of mercy at the hands of the representative of&#xD;
the .sovereign. Among them was the " observed of&#xD;
all observers," the Rev. Father Esmoid, now on the&#xD;
verge of one hundred years, emaciated and droop-&#xD;
ing, laboring to breathe, and so weak as to be sus-&#xD;
tained by the arms of Mr. De Courey and Sir&#xD;
Lawrence O'Donell, of Park Castle. His 'snow-&#xD;
white hair flowed down his shoulders, and nothing&#xD;
could be more affecting than the noble appeal made&#xD;
by the venerable father on behalf of Bryan Demp-&#xD;
sey. The fire of his eloquence seemed to arrest for&#xD;
the time the disease under which lie- labored. His,&#xD;
language flowed with ti e force and rapidity of a&#xD;
mountain torrent, tearing to shreds the vile efforts&#xD;
&#xD;
resorted to for obtaining a:conviction of guilt; the&#xD;
vindictive motives which impelled Bishop 3iggs ; the&#xD;
heart-rending scenes of the eviction ; the wondrous&#xD;
patience of the people ; the firm conviction in every&#xD;
mind of Dempsey's innocence, even before the real&#xD;
Umrderer had appeared. lie then dwelt on the Un-&#xD;
blemiished character, high principles and sterling&#xD;
worth of this )oor peasant whose life hung upon the&#xD;
decision of his excellelcy, and who awaited his fate&#xD;
with the heroism of a martyr. ie .wound up by&#xD;
Saillg&#xD;
My lord, I beseech you hear my words! The&#xD;
voice now soundingin your excellency's ear is as a&#xD;
voice from the grave. This is my last appeal to&#xD;
mortal ear ; in a few days more I shall be naunbered&#xD;
aimn1g the dead.. Soothe the dying hours of an old&#xD;
man who has spent nearly a century on earth, and&#xD;
God's blessing will rest upon you foreverI!&#xD;
The viceroy listened to hini with the deepest at-&#xD;
tention, never taking his eyes from the venerable&#xD;
form. It is said he was visibly affected by the ap-&#xD;
peal, but yet he gave no decisive answer,- merely&#xD;
stating lie would consider the petition and give an&#xD;
early reply. " I would beg to remind your excel-&#xD;
lency," exclaimed Mr. De Courcy, " there are but a&#xD;
few days left ; the 13th is named for the execution"&#xD;

&#xD;
The.viceroy bowed, and the deputation left actu-&#xD;
ated by conflicting feelings. Soie had strong hopes&#xD;
of a pardon; others hoped and feared alternately.&#xD;
Father Esmond alone felt sure of a refusal.&#xD;
" Deceive not yourselves, my dear friends," said&#xD;
he; " lie has to die ; I feel it, and his old priest has to&#xD;
pass him through that ordeal. Well, my God ; your'&#xD;
will he done ! I know it. I have that last effort to&#xD;
make for my poor child; and then, 0 Lord ! let Thy&#xD;
servant depart in peace ! " Shortly after the friends&#xD;
of justice had departed the landlord deputation were&#xD;
ushered into the presence of the viceroy, whose&#xD;
prejudices they worked upon for their own selfish&#xD;
ends, declaring they could not live in the country&#xD;
if Dempsey were pardoned.&#xD;
It is necessary," said they, "that an example&#xD;
should be made, in order to preserve the future tran-&#xD;
quillity and loyalty of the country; for, if the agita-&#xD;
tors can now obtain a triumph, they will burst into&#xD;
open rebellion against her majesty and her liege&#xD;
subjects!" or, in other words, they said: "It is ex-&#xD;
pedient that one should die for thepeople. If you&#xD;
miss this man you are no friend of Cesar."&#xD;
Could any language be more alike ?&#xD;
The viceroy pirnised an iimnediate investigation&#xD;
of the case and dismissed them.&#xD;
&#xD;
On the next day Father Esmond received an ofli-&#xD;
cial cornununication from his excellency's secretary,&#xD;
regretting he could not comply with the prayer of&#xD;
the petitioners regarding the pardon of the prisoner&#xD;
Dempsey.&#xD;
All were more or less disappointed, excepting two&#xD;
-Father Esmond and Winnie.&#xD;
Despair seized on poor Winnie from the moment&#xD;
her eye lighted on the constable as lie stood in the&#xD;
doorway of her happy home, throwing a shadow&#xD;
across the cottage floor, and a deeper and more last-&#xD;
ing one across her heart. Frequently adverting to&#xD;
that day, she would say to her father:&#xD;
"Oh, father ! I wish you saw us that day; we were&#xD;
so happy. He threw himself back in the chair, and&#xD;
we both laughed from our hearts out. It was our&#xD;
last on earth. The poor little ones all began laugh-&#xD;
ing too, even to the baby, who kicked and crowed.&#xD;
That. set her father in a kink; when it seemed as if&#xD;
the sun went out of a sudden. And, och ! och ! it did&#xD;
go out sure enough, and will never rise again for me.&#xD;
Oh, father! father! how can I live and think of my&#xD;
brave Bryan dying' on a gallows? And how can I&#xD;
look my poor orphans in the face ? Oh, God ! have&#xD;
mercy on my soul!"&#xD;

proach mingled in his gentle features, would ex.&#xD;
claim: "Oh, Winnie,. my annahi bawn ! what's that&#xD;
you're saying ? I know you did not think of yourself,&#xD;
or you would not talk as if it was any disgrace to&#xD;
die a martyr for Ihim who died as a criminal for us&#xD;
upon ,a tree. Don't you know well, Winnie, if Bry-&#xD;
an was not the heart's blood of a good Catholic he&#xD;
need have no fears of judge or jury ? Do you think&#xD;
if he was an Orangeman, or such a Catholic as could&#xD;
be brought over-like some we know-they would&#xD;
touch a hair of his head ? No, child ; he would be&#xD;
working his own farm still, and living in the house&#xD;
where he and his generations before him were born.&#xD;
But God forbid child of mine was ever ihe wife of&#xD;
an unprincipled man. I always loved Bryan Demp-&#xD;
sey; and a proud man I am this night to think that&#xD;
they could neither buf him with their wealth nor&#xD;
terrify him with their threats. If they hang him he&#xD;
willdie a martyr; but they may not be so bad as&#xD;
you think, after all, Winnie. Don't be givin' way&#xD;
to such black thoughts; God is good."&#xD;
"Oh, father ! don't try to raise my hopes; I know&#xD;
m elh lie has no mercy to expect from them. I know&#xD;
he will die a true and brave. martyr. Oh, God ! ford&#xD;
give me for repinin'. Father O'Tool was telling&#xD;
meand Bryan yesterday in the jail how they used&#xD;
&#xD;
to hunt priests in the time of Queen Elizabeth ; and&#xD;
how, when they'd catch them, they'd half hang&#xD;
them, thien tear their hearts out and they still alive,&#xD;
and cut them up iin quarters. It made ny heart&#xD;
sick. Father ! how can human beings be so cruel ?&#xD;
Sure, that's worse than the brutes."&#xD;
Brutes, child ! I wouldn't name them the same&#xD;
day with brutes. When human beings lose the&#xD;
grace of God they sink below the beasts of the field.&#xD;
Yes, indeed, Winnie, we must belong either to God&#xD;
or thil' devil; if God abandons us to our own pas-&#xD;
sions, sure we're blacker than any devil. The cross&#xD;

crossed themselves reverently. The 13th was named&#xD;
for the execution. I will not harrow my readers by&#xD;
describing the parting scene between Winnie and the&#xD;
husband she so devotedly loved, and their five little&#xD;
children. Not a tear came from  Winnie, for her&#xD;
grief was past tears. She fainted many times, and&#xD;
was at last carried away insensible, amidst the cries&#xD;
of her little ones, by her afflicted relatives. Father&#xD;
Esmond and Father O'Tool entered th cell soon&#xD;
after Winnie left, and found poor Bryan prostrate&#xD;
on the floor, little more than half alive. This was&#xD;
the evening of the 12th ; and before the jail was&#xD;
closed for the night a declaration was drawn up and&#xD;

witnessed by these two reverend gentlemen, two&#xD;
magistrates of the county, the deputy  overnor of&#xD;
the jail, and one of Dempsey's legal advisers. The&#xD;
following is a verbatim copy of the document :&#xD;
" County of Wicldow, to wit:&#xD;
"I, Bryan Dempsey, now a prisoner in Ardmore&#xD;
jail, and to be on to-morrow executed, do most sol-&#xD;
emnnly and sincerely declare in the presence of that&#xD;
God before whom I must shortly appear for judg'&#xD;
ment, that I never fired at the Right Reverend&#xD;
Bishop Biggs, that I never committed any act tending&#xD;
to injure him in person or property, that I never&#xD;
was cognizant of or party to any conspiracy or plot&#xD;
to shoot or injure the said Right Revrend Bishop&#xD;
Biggs; and that I am not guilty, directly or in-&#xD;
directly, of the crime for which I am to be lined.&#xD;
" Witnessed on this 12th day of February, 1846,&#xD;
by the under -gned."&#xD;
Here fo  wed the signatures.&#xD;
Father O'Tool remained all night in the cell of&#xD;
the martyr, praying with him when awake, and for&#xD;
him while he slept. At length the fatal morning&#xD;
dawned. When poor Bryan awoke from his last&#xD;
living sleep his heart died within him, and the room.&#xD;
seemed to swim around. Wildly he thouit of his&#xD;
loved home and its dear inmates, and his heart&#xD;
&#xD;
yearned to see them once again; but a mournful&#xD;
voice seemed to sound in his ears-" Never more,&#xD;
Bryan Dempsey! never more ! To-day you die a&#xD;
felon's death for murder! " Stretching out his hands,&#xD;
he cried aloud, "Oh, God! it is only a frightful&#xD;
dream ; it cannot be ! "&#xD;
Father O'Tool was beside him instantly. "My&#xD;
poor Bryan, have courage !&#xD;
" Oh ! father dear. Oh ! father asthore, machree!&#xD;
Sure I never hurted any man in my life; it can't be&#xD;
they will hang an innocent man !&#xD;
Father O'Tool silently presented him with the&#xD;
crucifix. lie eagerly grasped it, and pressed to his&#xD;
lips the representation of the bleeding feet. Sink-&#xD;
ing upon his knees, lie exclaimed: " Oh, blessed&#xD;
Jesus! you died on a felon tree for love of ime; and&#xD;
why should I refuse to die for love of you ? For-&#xD;
give the inurmurings of my weak heart, and give me&#xD;
strength that I may die with the fortitude becoming&#xD;
a Christian. Oh, merciful Lord! receive my soul&#xD;
into life everlasting."&#xD;
Father Esmond arrived early and administered to&#xD;
him the Most Adorable Sacrament for the last tiiime,&#xD;
as he had also done his first Communion. He&#xD;
prayed with him long and tenderly, and told him&#xD;
many anecdotes of the wonderful graces and lights&#xD;

bestowed by the Almighty upon those who are con-&#xD;
demned to death unjustly. Soon as the clock struck&#xD;
twelve they recited the "Angelus" together, and&#xD;
then Father Esmond said: "Bryan, my child ! your&#xD;
hour of glory is come!" He answered, in a firm&#xD;
voice : "I am ready. I follow Christ. I declare I&#xD;
am an innocent man !" He then moved after the&#xD;
governor of the prison to the fatal drop, answering,&#xD;
while Father O'Tool repeated the litany of Jesus:&#xD;
"Lord, have mercy on me ! Christ, have mercy on&#xD;
me!"   When he came in front of the jail, the )ile,&#xD;
haggard face and mournful eyes of him so full of&#xD;
life, and once so gay, smote every heart, and a cry of&#xD;
anguish burst from  the few spectators present.&#xD;
Bryan held the crucifix in his hand and exclaimed,&#xD;
in a clear deep voice, which fell upon the heart in&#xD;
tones not to be disbelieved or doubted: ".I declare&#xD;
before my God, that I had neither act, hand, part,&#xD;
nor knowledge of the crime for which I am going&#xD;
to die here!"&#xD;
The consummation had not yet come: thc victim&#xD;
was kept waiting for his doom for an hour-afterward.&#xD;
It was reported that Sir Gideon Chapman, the cotn&#xD;
mander of the garrison, was expecting a reprieve by&#xD;
the one o'clock Dublin train for a man who was sen-&#xD;
tenced to die at twelve!  These lying and cruel&#xD;
&#xD;
reports, however, did not move the people to a&#xD;
belief that the overseers-of the tragedy were si incere&#xD;
they only made them more despised.   One man&#xD;
asked of another in the street if the prisoner had&#xD;
fainted, or was the execution postponed ?  "No,"&#xD;
was the reply. "lIe is too strong in his innocence,&#xD;
and they want to keep him on and off for a while to&#xD;
see if he'll die like a dog."&#xD;
Poor Father Esmond, gasping for breath and&#xD;
shivering in every limb that cold gloomy day, till&#xD;
stood with the prisoner's hand clasped in his.&#xD;
" Oh ! father, asthore ! your reverence is killing&#xD;
yourself for me ; and what are a thousand lives like&#xD;
mine to yours ? Oh ! father, honey ! you're almost&#xD;
dead ; won't you go to the fire and, sit down ?"&#xD;
"No, my poor- child ; I thank you most kindly.&#xD;
But you surely do not want to part with your old&#xD;
spiritual father ?"&#xD;
"Part? Oh, would to God I could have you with&#xD;
me before the judgment-seat; you would plead for&#xD;
my poor soul to the God of mercies."&#xD;
"No,.Bran ; you will be alone there ; but you&#xD;
will stand before your Heavenly Father, who loves&#xD;
you more than I could ever do. I too shall- be&#xD;
there very, very soon after you ; we shall not be&#xD;

seen, ear bath not lieara, nor bath it entered into&#xD;
tlie heart of man to conceive the joys our Ieavenly&#xD;

Bryan fell upon his knees. " Father, give me&#xD;
your last blessing and absolution. I would not ex-&#xD;
change this death for the wealth and power of the&#xD;
whole world."&#xD;
Father Esinond laid his hand upon his head, and&#xD;
ere the last words died upon' his lips the officials&#xD;
came to conduct him to the fatal drop. Both priests&#xD;
warmly clasped his hands; and Father Esmond,&#xD;
raising aloft the crucifix, exclaimed-(as Abbe Edge-&#xD;
worth did, in similar words, to Louis XVI.)-" Mar-&#xD;
tyred victim of tyranny! go and be tried before a&#xD;
just tribunal&#xD;
The old man fainted and was borne away as the&#xD;
drop fell.&#xD;
All this time not a sound could be heard in the&#xD;
streets, not a footstep broke the awful stillness; and,&#xD;
except the clergy in attendance, the law officials, the&#xD;
&#xD;
reporters, and the military, who in large force sur-&#xD;
rounded the prison and stopped up every approach&#xD;
to it' not a human eye was bent to see this example&#xD;
of the- law's vindication.  All business was sus-&#xD;
piended; nearly all the shops in Ardmore-Protes-&#xD;
tants as well as Catholics-were closed. Traders,&#xD;
who had come from Dublin to attend the butter and&#xD;
wool market, usually largely supplied on Fridays,&#xD;
were disappointed to find not a single pound offered&#xD;
for sale, and the market as deserted as a wilderness.&#xD;
Deep grief was in every home, and it seemed as if&#xD;
the destroying angel had passed over the town-its&#xD;
streets deserted, its look so vacant and death-like.&#xD;
Once in a while a neighbor would pass from one&#xD;
house to another, and in the clenched hands and&#xD;
teeth and passion-dark faces there were signs of&#xD;
a spirit which unjust sentences could not allay. For&#xD;
an hour or two anxious, peering faces and tearful&#xD;
eyes were thrust out watching in the direction of the&#xD;
jail.&#xD;
About four o'clock, as the shades of evening were&#xD;
beginning to fall, about twe'enty men passed through&#xD;
the principal street in the direction of Bryan Demp-&#xD;
sey's home. They kept as much as possible the&#xD;
military step and walked   two deep in solemn&#xD;
silence. The four foremost bore on their shoulders&#xD;

a bier, on which was a handsome coffin of black&#xD;
velvet, with a silver cross and silver haniIdles. This&#xD;
was provided by M'. De Courcy. In it were laid&#xD;
the mortal remains of poor Bryan Dempsey. Loud&#xD;
were the wailings and deep the anguish when the&#xD;
mournful cavalcade reached the cottage. When it&#xD;
was set down and the lid raised, Winnie was brought&#xD;
by her father to look upon the body of her young&#xD;
husband. They first all knelt down and joined in&#xD;
prayer for the repose of his soul, and s rength for&#xD;
the bereaved widow. She then approached, slud-&#xD;
dering ; but, to the astonishment of ,ill present, her&#xD;
countenance brightened as she gazed upon him. He&#xD;
was dressed in the brown habit of the scapular, and&#xD;
on his breast, in letters formed of white satin ri bbon,&#xD;
were the initials, I. II. S. His hands were clasped&#xD;
together, as if in prayer, and held a small wreath&#xD;
of palm-leaves-th (mblem of martyrdom. The&#xD;
hair was brushed back off his forehead, which was&#xD;
white as alabaster, and the handsome, manly fea-&#xD;
tures were caim an I flir as marble. Not a feature&#xD;
was distorted-a smile even seemed to linger on the&#xD;
lips. Winnie gazed long in mute admiration. She&#xD;
thought she had never seen anything so beautiful&#xD;
At length, in a low voice, she said: " Father, who&#xD;
did all this for him?"&#xD;

"Two ladies, asthore-Mrs. De Courcy, and Miss&#xD;

The young widow looked in her father's face and&#xD;
then at her dead husband two or three times; then,&#xD;
uttering a wild cry,. she burst into tears. They were&#xD;
the first she had wept since Bryan's arrest. The&#xD;
pent-up fountains seemed closed to all her sorrows ;&#xD;
but this touching tribute to his innocence and&#xD;
worth broke the spell, and tears like the rain fell&#xD;
upon the lifeless remains of him she loved so well&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
CLARA MENVILLE had received an account from&#xD;
the superioress of the convent of the progress of&#xD;
the trial. She besought Clara to write, and try to&#xD;
influence her uncle in causing the liberation of this&#xD;
just man, that his blood miglt not be at his -door.&#xD;
Poor Clara was in anguish of mind. She knew a&#xD;
letter would be unavailing ; but if she could only&#xD;
reach Glengoulah she would throw herself on her&#xD;
knees and kiss his feet, and wash them with her&#xD;
tears-but, ohm! how was she to reach Ireland ? Ier&#xD;
father was spending the winter in Rome, and she&#xD;
and her sister were staying at Toppleton Hall, Chei'&#xD;
shire, the seat of Viscount Toppleton, a nephew of&#xD;
her father, whose lady, though an excellent woman&#xD;
in her way, was a rigid upholder of all the. pro-&#xD;
prieties observed by ladies of rank. Clara, though&#xD;
perfectly aware of her weak points, undauntedly&#xD;
flew' to her and passionately begged permission to&#xD;
leave by that evening's steamer for Ireland. She&#xD;
rapidly portrayed the heart-rending scenes now pass-&#xD;
ing in Wicklow, and urged the impossibility of de-&#xD;
&#xD;
laying one night without losing her reason. Lady&#xD;
Toppleton was utterly 'horror-stricken at such a&#xD;
bi'each of etiquette, reminding her how his lordship&#xD;
was absent in Parliament, and no one there who&#xD;
could with propriety accompany her. She would&#xD;
have read her a homily on the importance of ladies&#xD;
of rank being always calm and unmoved, especially&#xD;
by the occurrences of common life ; but Clara,&#xD;
Whose thoughts were far away, abruptly asked if&#xD;
lhe could not travel with her nurse-a respectable,&#xD;
middle-aged matron, wlioin she_ devotedly loved,&#xD;
and who always had remained with. her since the&#xD;
death of her mother. Lady Toppleton, struck duinb&#xD;
with amazem ent, stared at her as though she feared&#xD;
the contingency hinted at had already taken place,&#xD;
and that her senses were clean gone. ..She arose and&#xD;
rang the bell, ordering her carriage immediately.&#xD;
"Miss Clara Menville, go to your room !" said&#xD;
she, witm haughty dignity. "I am going to the par-&#xD;
sonage to consult with Mr. Audley on this affair,&#xD;
and shall in all probability impart the result on my&#xD;
retui-n."&#xD;
Probably not, Lady Toppleton: nous verrons!&#xD;
When the carriage was out oftsight Clara rang for&#xD;
her nurse, and telling her it was a matter of life and&#xD;
death for her to leave Toppleton Hall and reach the&#xD;

Liverpool railway station within half an hour, she&#xD;
hastily got packed a few changes of clothing, ordered&#xD;
her pony phaeton to the door, into which she jumped&#xD;
with her nurse, driving herself, as was her custom,&#xD;
with her " tiger" behind. As Lady Toppleton drove&#xD;
up the avenue from the parsonage she met the boy&#xD;
bringing home the phaeton, and learned from him,&#xD;
to her unspeakable horror, that Miss Clara and M's.&#xD;
Bunse were on the road to Liverpool.&#xD;
The impulsive Clara thought the train was going&#xD;
at an unusually slow pace, while the truth was it was&#xD;
flying at the rate of forty miles an hour, and was in&#xD;
agonies when it stopped in a town or village. .She&#xD;
could neither eat nor sleep. .Intent only upon one&#xD;
thought-the saving of a fellow-creature's life-she&#xD;
threw to the winds the cold barriers of etiquette&#xD;
and position. Arriving in Dublin late at night, she&#xD;
flew post-haste to Glengoulah Castle. Day was just&#xD;
breaking on the morning of February 13th as she&#xD;
ascended the castle steps. IHere she met a bitter dis-&#xD;
appointment : her uncle, they told her, left the castle&#xD;
the night the senteince was passed on Bryan Demp-&#xD;
sey, and was staying at the Club House, Sackville&#xD;
street, Dublin, and the execution was to take place&#xD;
at noon that day. Mrs. Biggs was in England.&#xD;
Poor Clara wept most passionately-she saw the,&#xD;
&#xD;
hopelessness of achieving her object now. Pacing&#xD;
the floor and wringing her hands, she exclaimed&#xD;
wildly: " Too late !e too. late! My God ! must he&#xD;
die ?"  Throwing her arms around her nurse, she&#xD;
wept bitterly on her bosom. Then, starting up, a&#xD;
thought seized her-she would go to Mr. De Courcy,&#xD;
and see if anything could be done. Requesting&#xD;
Mrs. l3unse to await her at the castle, she ordered a&#xD;
carriage and drove to Mr. De Courcy's. That ex-&#xD;
cellent gentleman and his wife received their unex-&#xD;
pected guest with. a thousand welcomes.  They&#xD;
made every exertion to console her, but Clara wept&#xD;
long and sadly-all her hopes were dashed to earth&#xD;
-all her plais frustrated.&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy told her the utter impossibility of&#xD;
getting a reprieve, even had she arrived in time ;&#xD;
explained to her how the real murderer, struck with&#xD;
remorse, had declared himself the guilty party, and&#xD;
was willing now to die in expiation of his crime, and&#xD;
to save this innocent man ; how Father Esmond had&#xD;
gone to Dublin Castle and pleaded for the prisoner&#xD;
in the most moving eloquence before the viceroy&#xD;
himself-but all in vaii ! Ifer uncle had sworn&#xD;
poiiit-blank that Dempsey was the man-he could&#xD;
not be mistaken-so Dempsey must die! Clara's&#xD;
tears again flowed bitterly. "Can I do nothing ?"&#xD;

she cried ; "-have I fled from my home like a crim-&#xD;
inal, to be of no use to any one ?"&#xD;
"No, my dear young lady," said Mrs. De Courcy;&#xD;
"you were not permitted by the Almighty to take&#xD;
a useless voyage. I doubt not you are destined to&#xD;
play a most useful part in this sad drama. If you&#xD;
cannot save the condemned, *you can console his&#xD;
young widow and bring comfort to his orphan little&#xD;
ones. We can all take our share in such acts as.&#xD;
these."&#xD;
" Oh, yes ; thank God ! " said Clara, sprimnging up.&#xD;
"1 thank you heartily for the suggestion. Let us go&#xD;
and be doing at once, for I feel that my heart will&#xD;
burst if I cannot do something for this poor victim.&#xD;
Oh, uncle ! uncle ! God;pardon you ! "&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy insisted upon her taking breakfast&#xD;
before leaving the house; so having swallowed a&#xD;
cup of tea both ladies drove to the Convent of Ard-&#xD;
more first. Clara, on account of her connection&#xD;
with Bishop Biggs, felt a delicacy in intruding her-&#xD;
self upon Dempsey's family, and wished to be di-&#xD;
rected by the superioress how to act. The reverend&#xD;
mother was overjoyed to see lher.&#xD;
" Well, ladies," said she, when all were seated,&#xD;
"s if ever an earnest prayer to God was quickly re-&#xD;
sponded to, surely mine was this morning. I am in -&#xD;
&#xD;
I1&#xD;
&#xD;
such trouble for my Poor child Winiie, whom we&#xD;
educated here, that I have been trying to think of&#xD;
every plan to console her. Her another was here&#xD;
yesterday to ask the prayers of the community for&#xD;
her; she has not shed a tear since her husband was&#xD;
arrested, and has had frequent fainting fits. I have&#xD;
great fears for her if his body is brought home to her&#xD;
disfigured, as I hear is common after strangulation ;&#xD;
and I was just thinUng of getting some charitable&#xD;
woman to arrange his features after death, and to&#xD;
dress his body in the habit of Our Blessed Lady.&#xD;
Now the difficulty is to get permission to do this&#xD;
from  the authorities. I can get plenty of pious&#xD;
Christians to perform the task, but they are poor,&#xD;
and consequently would not be heeded. I then ap-&#xD;
pealed to St. Joseph, earnestly begging through his&#xD;
intercession that I might be .directed to some influ-&#xD;
ential person who would procure this favor for my&#xD;
employs. I was coming out of the chapel after&#xD;
making my petition for the sixth or seventh time&#xD;
when the door-bell rang, and the moment I saw you&#xD;
both I knew my prayer was heard. God be praised&#xD;
for all His mercies !"&#xD;
"IMost certainly, reverend mother," replied Mrs.&#xD;
De Courcy. "We can, no doubt, easily obtain&#xD;
your request. Mr. De Courcy has already ordered&#xD;

" Oh, Heaven reward him ; it is just like him."&#xD;
" Reverend mother," said Clara, in a low voice,&#xD;
"have you yet appointed the persons to do this&#xD;
work 2?"&#xD;
"No, Miss Menville; but I know two respectable&#xD;
women who, I am sure, will do it for'the love of&#xD;
God."&#xD;
Clara grasped her hand.  " Oh, dear mother!&#xD;
please permit me to be one.of the persons and you&#xD;
will confer a favor on ne"&#xD;
Mother Josepl started. " You? dear child! Oh,&#xD;
no, no ; that would be too much to expect."&#xD;
"Ai! Mother Joseph! you do not deem     me&#xD;
worthy?"&#xD;
The superioress could not speak; tears, streamed&#xD;
down her cheeks; she clasped the youthful heroine&#xD;
of charity in her arms.&#xD;
"011, mnyprecious child ! how rich in God's grace!&#xD;
But it would be too frightful a task for one so&#xD;
young."&#xD;
"No, no, mother; please do not refuse me. I&#xD;
came a long journey to save the life of this martyr;&#xD;
but as I have been unable to effect my object, do&#xD;
not refuse me this great favor. Mother, if you do&#xD;

" My dear young lady, who coull resist. charity&#xD;
like yours ? I shall send a very pious and respecta-&#xD;

1\rs. De Courcy was struck dumb with astonish-&#xD;
ment-adimration succeeded ; and as the high born&#xD;
Clara proceeded to beg as a favor a task from which&#xD;
human nature recoiled, she sobbed audibly. She&#xD;
had never seen charity like this before. "My God! "&#xD;
she cried to herself, "if this be Catholicism, give me&#xD;
light to direct me, that I and all who are dear to&#xD;
me may embrace it."   An impulse of God's holy&#xD;
love immediately filled her soul with a feeling en-&#xD;
tirely new. The world seemed naught to her, and&#xD;
she felt an unaccountable strength vibrate through&#xD;
every nerve. Something seemed to say for her (as&#xD;
she declares to this day she never could say it her.&#xD;
self) " Mother, I will be that assistant; I will not&#xD;
be outdone in generosity by this noble young lady,&#xD;
who sets me such an heroic example !"&#xD;
It was long before the tender heart of Mother Jo.&#xD;
seph could reply, so entirely was she overcome by&#xD;
her feelings.&#xD;
"Oh, wondrous love of God !" she at length ex.&#xD;

ing her tearful eyes on Mrs. De Courcy, she said:&#xD;
" It shall be as you say, dear lady; I would not for&#xD;
worlds deprive you of the merit of such an action.&#xD;
S.ure I am, Mrs. De Courcy, our Blessed Lord will&#xD;
bestow on you also the greatest gift in the treasury&#xD;
of Heaven." She brought down the brown habit&#xD;
of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, and explained its&#xD;
meaning to Mrs. De Courcy, who had never se n1&#xD;
one before. Miss Menville was familiar with tl e r&#xD;
already, but begged permission, to make a wreath&#xD;
of palm-leaves from the garden. They drove to the&#xD;
prison, and had an interview at the governor's house&#xD;
with the high sheriff. Mrs. De Courcy introduced&#xD;
Miss Menville, niece of Lord Biggs. The sheriff&#xD;
bowed profoundly; and when Clara made her re-&#xD;
quest he immediately assented, and directed the&#xD;
governor to send word to the ladies the moment the&#xD;
prisoner's body was cut down, and to have it con-&#xD;
veyed to a room in his own house, and everything&#xD;
prepared for their reception.  The in termed i ate&#xD;
time was spent by Clara in the chapel of the&#xD;
convent praying for the soul of him who was&#xD;
about to appear before his Eternal Judge, and beg-&#xD;
ging mercy and conversion for her unfortunate&#xD;
uncle.&#xD;
The governor came himself to announce that the&#xD;
&#xD;
306&#xD;
&#xD;
execution was over. Poor Mrs. De Courcy's heart&#xD;
sank within her, and she turned deadly pale.&#xD;
"Kneel a moment with me," said Clara.&#xD;
She knelt and repeated with her three flail Marys,&#xD;
"in honor of the tears our Blessed Mother shed when&#xD;
the adorable body of her Divine Son was placed in&#xD;
her arms, that she would procure strength for them&#xD;
to accomplish the task they had undertaken."&#xD;
They arose much strengthened and drove rapidly&#xD;
to the prison. Clara knelt beside the body of poor&#xD;
Bryan Dempsey, which was laid upon the, floor.&#xD;
She closed his eyes and arranged his features, while&#xD;
Mrs. De Courcy combed back his dark chestnut&#xD;
hair, and was surprised how little horror she ex-&#xD;
perienced in performing offices she once imagined&#xD;
she never could fill. Poor Bryan had carefully&#xD;
washed and shaved himself that morning, preparing&#xD;
for the reception of the Most Holy Sacrament, and&#xD;
their task was thus rendered easy. The governor's&#xD;
wife sent her servants to assist. the ladies, but they&#xD;
would suffer no one to tbucli the body only them-&#xD;
selves until the coffin came, when they accepted the&#xD;
services of the undertaker's men to put it in its last&#xD;
receptacle. When this was accomplished, they re-&#xD;
mained to keep watch beside the body until Toney&#xD;
Byrne, his sons, son-in-law, and a few neighbors camo&#xD;

to convey it home. Toney was quite surprised to&#xD;
see Mrs. De Courcy in such a place. She drew him&#xD;
aside and told him who the beautiful young lady was&#xD;
standing beside the coffin,'and detailed the part she&#xD;
had acted, and its motive, carefully remaining silent&#xD;
on her own share in the transaction. She other&#xD;
brought him to look at Bryan's body. .Toney Byrne&#xD;
could not utter a word; but kneeling in the midst&#xD;
of friends he prayed silently, while great drops&#xD;
poured down his cheeks. Clara, immediately divin-&#xD;
ing who he was, drew back with instinctive delicacy&#xD;
until he had concluded. She then approached, and&#xD;
taking his hand said, " Are you not Mr. Byrne ?"&#xD;
"Yes, miss. May God's blessing light upon you.&#xD;
ITll never forget till, my dying, hour what you have&#xD;
done this day,"&#xD;
" My good friend, I was not alone; to Mrs. De&#xD;
Courcy you are more indebted than to me."&#xD;
Toney raised his eyes to Heaven; and again the&#xD;
great tears rolled, but lie could not speak. His&#xD;
friends now lifted the coffin, and the mournful caval-&#xD;
cade moved on.&#xD;

IIAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
.13YAN DEMPSEY'S body was waked from        Friday&#xD;
evening until Sunday.     Father O'Tool went there&#xD;
two or three times each day, and members of the&#xD;
Purgatorian and other religious societies kept re-&#xD;
lieving each other at stated intervals of the day and&#xD;
night, saying rosaries and litanies for his soul. Noine&#xD;
others were admitted excepting his immediate rela-&#xD;
tives and old neighbors.&#xD;
On Sunday the funeral took place at three o'clock&#xD;
P. M. to the chapel yard of Tinmanogue, where&#xD;
all his kindred slept. The lprocessionl was immienise,&#xD;
and was attended by many gentlemen of rank, who&#xD;
wished to mark their disapprobation of this legalized&#xD;
murder.   The tolling of the old bell and the meas-&#xD;
ured tread of the silent multitude recalled to many&#xD;
the beautiful lines of Davis:&#xD;
"Why rings the knell of the funeral bell&#xD;

Winnie returned       home to her now        desolate cot.&#xD;
tage, where the light of her life had           been forever&#xD;
quenched; but the         fountain    of her heart's grief&#xD;
flowed freely, and a soft and tender sorrow now&#xD;
reigned   where a wild       and   burning    agony   so long&#xD;
dwelt.    She and     her family     blessed   God    for  the&#xD;
change. Soon, too, she was called on to minister to&#xD;
the wants of those she was bound to by the strongest&#xD;
ties of gratitude.     It was the intention of Mrs. Do&#xD;
Courcy and Miss Menville to visit Winnie before the&#xD;
interment of Bryan, but on reaching Cascade House&#xD;
that evening from the jail poor Clara was seized&#xD;
with a violent fever, and by midnight was delirious.&#xD;
The terrible excitement she had undergone, joined&#xD;
with   loss of rest and     fatigue, told fearfully on     her&#xD;
tender frame. Her nurse came from the castle to&#xD;
&#xD;
wait upon her, but Mrs. De Courcy gave strict or-&#xD;
ders that no one should inform Toney Byrne or any&#xD;
of his family of Miss Menville's illness, therefore&#xD;
they remained in ignorance of the sad event until&#xD;
the day after Bryan's funeral. The instant Winnie&#xD;
heard the news she repaired to Cascade House, and&#xD;
kneeling beside the unconscious Clara poured forth&#xD;
tears and prayers for her recovery. She would wil-&#xD;
lingly have taken the place of Mrs. Bunse, but that&#xD;
bustling lady would not suffer any hands to tend her&#xD;
darling but her own. Winnie or either of her pa-&#xD;
rents were there many times every day, and soon had&#xD;
the )leasu'e of hearing that their young benefactress&#xD;
was pronounced out of danger.&#xD;
A new and severer trial now awaited them. Win-&#xD;
nie, on her return from Cascade House one evening&#xD;
during the week, received a message that Father Es-&#xD;
mond wished to see her. She flew to her dear spir-&#xD;
itual father, whom she found propped up in bed with&#xD;
pillows, and breathing more freely than lie had done&#xD;
for years. Ile seemed calm and collected.&#xD;
" Oh father, honey!" cried Winnie, leaning over&#xD;
beside his bed; " is it true what they tell me, that&#xD;
you are better ?"&#xD;
" Yes, my child-;. the great drag is gone from my&#xD;
chest, and I feel light and easy. My good God is&#xD;

" My poor Winnie, have you not sorrows enough&#xD;
of your own to weep for, without shedding tears for&#xD;
mee ?"&#xD;
" Oh, father ! sure it's the black sorrow to the&#xD;
whole country to lose you ! And what will ever be-&#xD;
come of the poor ? "&#xD;
" Winnie, the poo' are God's chosen children, and&#xD;
He is a most loving father. Ie will take care of&#xD;
them, and raise a better friend for them than I could&#xD;
ever be. I am rejoiced to hear, my poor child, that&#xD;
you are proving yourself worthy to be the widow of&#xD;
Bryan Dempsey. I sent for you, Winnie, that you&#xD;
might be with me in my last moments, as I was with&#xD;
him. I thought it would gratify you."&#xD;
" Oh, my father ! how could your reverence think&#xD;
of inc at such a time ? But it is just like you-sure&#xD;
you never thought of yourself. I wanted to come&#xD;
and see you the night he was buried ; but my father&#xD;
and mother wouldn't let me. They said I would&#xD;
&#xD;
make you worse, and that I should keep out of your&#xD;
sight till you got better. Oh! father, asthore ! what&#xD;
can I ever say to you; or how can I bear to think of&#xD;
it? Sure we all know it was on his account you&#xD;
lost your life. Oh, my darlin' ! niy darling' ! If you&#xD;
go I don't ever wish to raise my head again. To&#xD;
think of you travelling to Dublin Castle with such&#xD;
a sickness upon you, in the depth of winter, to save.&#xD;
him. And. after all-after all-to think that your&#xD;
snow-white hairs and your sacred calling were dis-&#xD;
respected,. and the word-of a black-hearted hypocrite&#xD;
taken before you! Oh, grief of my heart ! to think&#xD;
I lived to see this crowning of all griefs! "&#xD;
Wiinnie's tears flowed like the rain, and her whole&#xD;
body rocked f'roim the inward storm like a young tree&#xD;
swayed by the wind. Father Esmond waited until&#xD;
the first blast of the heart's tempest passed away.&#xD;
le then said:&#xD;
" W innie, I principally sent for you to ask a favor&#xD;
at your hands. I ask it for God's pure love."&#xD;
Winnie .fell on her knees. " Oh, father ! sure&#xD;
you know if you asked my heart's blood I would&#xD;
give it; and it's the good right I'd, have to give it."&#xD;
Then, my child, you must promise me you will&#xD;
say daily, and teach your children to say it with&#xD;
you, three Hail Marys for 'the conversion of your&#xD;

unfortunate landlord, and all who were concerned&#xD;
in the legal murder of your husband!"&#xD;
Winnie gazed on the sinking features of the dying&#xD;
saint. She seemed choking for a moment, and then&#xD;
raid :         .&#xD;
"Father, I would willingly do it; but how could&#xD;
I ask such a prayer with my lips unless my heart&#xD;
went with it? Oh ! father, asthore ! I cannot tell a&#xD;
lie. I don't wish them harm; but I can't bear to&#xD;
think of them, nor to mention their names. Sure,&#xD;
God who sees my heart would not hear such a&#xD;
prayer! Indeed, father, I can't help it !"&#xD;
"Then, my child, you must earnestly pray that&#xD;
God may remove such bad feelings from your heart.&#xD;
You may rest assured our Blessed Lady will obtain&#xD;
for you proper feelings of charity if you strive to&#xD;
overcome yourself and say what I tell you. God&#xD;
does not expect impossibilities. He knows how&#xD;
sorely your poor human nature has been tried; and&#xD;
if He sees you trying to conquer it, He will shower&#xD;
upon you most abundant gifts and graces. Winnie,&#xD;
I asked this same favor of your puor IPryan before&#xD;
he was led to execution. He never hesitated, but&#xD;
went on his knees and joined most fervently with&#xD;
me. I asked him if he would like you an 1 his chil-&#xD;
dren to pray for the same object, and he said he&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
would very much. Your ,good, pious father has&#xD;
ever set you this example of Christian charity; but,&#xD;
Winnie, I ask it not for the love of father, mother,&#xD;
or of your old pastor, nor even to comply with the&#xD;
last wish of your loving husband ; no, Winnie, not&#xD;
for any or all of these must you do this-you must&#xD;
do it for the love of Him for whom all, our actions&#xD;
should be done-for our dear Lord Jesus, who prayed&#xD;
for the wicked wretches who nailed him to a&#xD;
cross."&#xD;
Winnie bowed her head to the ground and sobbed&#xD;
convulsively for a few moments; then rising, she&#xD;
said:&#xD;
" Father, I will faithfully do as you tell me, and&#xD;
teach my children to do the same, with God's bless-&#xD;
ing, while there's life in my body or speech in my&#xD;
tongue !"&#xD;
Father Esmond held out his hand, now shaking&#xD;
with the death tremor. " God reward you, my dear&#xD;
child. I can now die in peace. May the blessing&#xD;
of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, descend upon&#xD;
you and yours, and remain with you forever."&#xD;
His voice grew faint, and Winnie called in Mrs.&#xD;
Malone, who administered restoratives. Reports flew&#xD;
around that he was in his death agony, and all the&#xD;
neighbors flocked in. Approaching midnight his&#xD;

agony really commenced. Father O'Tool put the&#xD;
blessed candle in his hand and held it there. Sev-&#xD;
eral other priests from  the neighboring parishes&#xD;
were present, one of whom recited the beautiful&#xD;
prayers for the departing. To the surprise of all&#xD;
he joined in the responses himself. When the l'yers&#xD;
were concluded lie opened his eyes and looked&#xD;
around the apartment. Seeing so many of his pa~&#xD;
rishioners in tears, he said : "May God bless you all,&#xD;
my faithful, loving children. We will meet again&#xD;
in our heavenly kingdom. 'Oh ! how lovely are&#xD;
thy tabernacles, 0 Lord of Hosts! My soul faint-&#xD;
eth for the courts of the Lord.'."  He seemed trans-&#xD;
ported in an ecstasy. After a moment or two he&#xD;
cried out: " Jesus ! Jesus ! receive my soul," and,&#xD;
turning his head on the pillow, calmly expired. Si-&#xD;
lence reigned around until Father O'Tool, extin-&#xD;
guishing the light, sank upon his knees, and ex-&#xD;
claimed: " Eternal rest grant unto him, U Lord !"&#xD;
and lie burst into tears. Then the sobs and lamenta-&#xD;
tions of the bereaved parishioiiers were mournful to&#xD;
hear. Alh ! those were sorrowful days in Tinma-&#xD;
nogue. A funeral pall seemed to hang over the beau-&#xD;
tifal village. Every shop was closed, every bell&#xD;
tolled-that of the convent, the old elm-tree lie loved&#xD;
so well, the school-house, where in days of yore he&#xD;

spent so many hours instructing the boys now grown&#xD;
to iUlIilood, and too many, alas ! eating the real&#xD;
of exile in a foreign land. All tolled mournfully,&#xD;
and bore the sad intelligence through the echoing&#xD;
hills around. The father, friend, counsellor, con-&#xD;
soler, peace-naker, and pastor, so idolized for more&#xD;
than half a century, was gone from them-just when&#xD;
they thought they needed him most, and could least&#xD;
spa'e him. But so they would have thought any&#xD;
time he might be called.&#xD;
" Sheep without a shepherd,&#xD;
WXhen the sow AIts out the sky."&#xD;
The cruciform chapel, enbowered in shrubs, was&#xD;
crowded night and day until he was laid in the&#xD;
tom1). A contilinolls stream of people passed and&#xD;
re-passed in and out, with tear-washed cheeks and&#xD;
sad hearts. They were taking their last look of their&#xD;
beloved father as he lay in. his coffin, dressed in his&#xD;
eeelesiastical robes, his white hair floating down his&#xD;
shoulders, and his saintly features smiling. They&#xD;
waked him thus before the altar where lie had so often&#xD;
celebrated the-divine mysteries, and where his fath-&#xD;
erly tones and venerable appearance so many times&#xD;
recalled to them  the Apostles of old. But the&#xD;
family that mourned him most was Toney Byrne's,&#xD;
for they felt he had shortened his precious life by the&#xD;

&#xD;
hardships he had ulndergone, first by trying to save&#xD;
the life of Bryan Dcmpsey, and then in consoling&#xD;
his last moments.&#xD;
lie was buried in the chapel-yard among his&#xD;
flock; and, according to his own request, no fence&#xD;
was put up between him and his loved parishioners.&#xD;
Ilis grave was belde the chapel, and on the edge of&#xD;
the centre walk, thait all might find him accessible&#xD;
in death, as he always was in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
ON the same night, and at the same hour when&#xD;
the venerable pastor of Glengoulah was conducted&#xD;
by angels to the throne of the Eternal Father,&#xD;
whom he ever strove to serve, while his last sighs&#xD;
were embalmed by the tears and prayers of his lov-&#xD;
nug people, quite a different scene was enacting in&#xD;
Dublin.&#xD;
In a sumptuously furnished apartment of the&#xD;
Club House, Sackville street, a man lay moaning&#xD;
on a bed of down.*      Four stalwart-looking men&#xD;
in their shirt-sleeves watched beside him. Their&#xD;
strength was frequently put to the test to keep the&#xD;
wretched sufferer from jumping out of the window,&#xD;
or dashing his head against the wall ; they were&#xD;
then obliged to force him into the bed,, or strap him.&#xD;
in a large invalid chair.   Sleep had been long a&#xD;
stranger to his wild and frenzied eyes, and at times&#xD;
his shrieks were appalling.&#xD;
"I tell you the truth, Jim," said one of the watch-&#xD;
* It is a well-established fact that Sir Francis Hopkins was obliged to be&#xD;
strapped to a bed (after the execution of Seery) at the Club House, Sackville&#xD;
street, and finally died a lunatic somewhere on the continent.&#xD;

fits at sight of them. One time, when we were&#xD;
making' the bed, he caught sight of himself in the&#xD;
lookin'-glass and run under the bed, where he&#xD;
squeezed himself flat like a pancake. Be the Boyne,&#xD;
but it's hard work, your honors, to attind himi. My-&#xD;
self wouldn't take tin pounds a night if I knew what&#xD;
was afore me; but I wouldn't break my engagement,&#xD;
onst I made it, for five hundred pounds."&#xD;
Joe and George made a face at one another at the&#xD;
back of the physicians when they heard Alick's hon-&#xD;
orable account of himself. One of the doctors held&#xD;
his pulse until two other physicians entered ; then&#xD;
all went into consultation. The consequence was lie&#xD;
was strapped to the bed, his head shaved, and a large&#xD;
blister applied to the poll, while bags of ice were&#xD;
kept to his temples. The doctors remained all night,&#xD;
relieving one another at stated intervals. By morn-&#xD;
ing he seemed calm. About eight o'clock A. M. the&#xD;
Kingstown train brought his lady and suite, who ar-&#xD;
rived by the mail boat from London. The physi-&#xD;
cians, after consultation, deemed it best to bring her&#xD;
to him unannounced. She walked with a languid&#xD;
air to the bedside, and began to weep in an embroid-&#xD;
ered handkerchief. He fixed his eyes wildly upon&#xD;
her, and convulsive tremors shook his frame. IJ'h&#xD;
said, in a hissing whisper, "Are you his widow?"&#xD;
&#xD;
322&#xD;
&#xD;
The lady renewed her tears.&#xD;
"I tell you I can do nothing for you. I tried to&#xD;
save him since, I came here, but they kept me&#xD;
strapped down. I told the judge the day before I&#xD;
left the castle not to hang him, but he said it was too&#xD;
late. Curse the old fool for being always too late.&#xD;
Curse you .too, and the whole Papist crew; and&#xD;
curse myself. G- d you ! don't you hear me&#xD;
tursing myself ; and why do you cry?  I can't give&#xD;
him back to you if you were to cry till doomsday. I&#xD;
know he's dead. I saw him hanging there-on that&#xD;
wall. He leered at me and grinned as he was going&#xD;
off the drop."&#xD;
" Oh, dear husband I do not speak so horribly :"&#xD;
said the xveeping lady.&#xD;
" I tell you, woman ! your husband did grin at&#xD;
me; he did! And oh, God! how frightful he looked!&#xD;
I see him again ! There he is! He is always leer-&#xD;
ing and mocking me!"&#xD;
The lady turned to leave the room. He shouted&#xD;
after her: "Come here, you woman ! I want to&#xD;
make a bargain with you. I'll give you your choice&#xD;
of the best farm in Glengoulali if you will keep&#xD;
him from following me&#xD;
The lady now thought she would try to soothe&#xD;
him. "Oh, my dear! you are laboring under a&#xD;

delusion. There is no one trying to follow you,&#xD;
No one can follow you."&#xD;
He made violent efforts to disengage himself&#xD;
from his bands, and failing he glared upon her and&#xD;
shrieked out:&#xD;
" Do you dare tell me I lie ? You are a cursed&#xD;
fool, you low, contemptible creature, to doubt the&#xD;
word of a bisiop. I tell you a huntsinan with a&#xD;
yelping pack after his heels is not more surrounded&#xD;
than I am. My life has been most miserable for&#xD;
more than a year. I had wealth and honors, but no&#xD;
happiness. I drank to drown my miseries, but it&#xD;
would not do-it was then I suffered most. A&#xD;
curse, I say again, upon my obstinate tenantry.&#xD;
They wouldn't hear the true gospel from me ; but&#xD;
would believe their d-d. old priests. I swore to&#xD;
make them IProtestants, or to have my revenge, and&#xD;
I had it ! ila, ha, ha ! I'm glad I made them suflr !&#xD;
I had my revenge ! But, G--d d-n them ! they&#xD;

and set me nearly crazy with their abuse ; sone-&#xD;
tiimes they come alone, but in such rapid succession&#xD;
that they bewilder me. Last night-that old villain&#xD;
Fhiniiigan was here abusing me for pulling down&#xD;
his house ; he accused imie of leaving himi homeless&#xD;
and childless, because his children were drowned at&#xD;

sea on their vay to America. Then Fogarty walked&#xD;
in to curse me, because his old mother died a luna-&#xD;
tie, because she lost the farm  and was starving.&#xD;
Then in came thirty-seven that were evicted from&#xD;
the townland of Drismore shortly before Christmas,&#xD;
each telling a dismal tale of suffering, enough to&#xD;
drive any one mad but myself. Then the widow&#xD;
Ryan came in and abused ie because the .bailiffs&#xD;
carried out her two children in the rain, and both&#xD;
sick in scarlet fever, and they died next day (she&#xD;
says). I verily believe they died just to spite me-&#xD;
these papists are very vindictive. Then in came the&#xD;
widow Cormac, and blew a perfect hurricane fromn&#xD;
her nostrils.  I felt the bed rock under me, and&#xD;
everything was blown about; the snow began to&#xD;
fall, and she pointed to a heap of it that had drifted&#xD;
into a pile, and there that wild maniac daughter of&#xD;
hers lay dead. They never let me get a wink of&#xD;
sleep, but stand leering and grinning at me when&#xD;
they are tired abusing. I do .not heed them, how-&#xD;
ever. I crouch down and keep very still until they&#xD;
are gone. Then I try to get away, and scream out&#xD;
for help, but no one cares to save me. I could bear&#xD;
any of them-yes,-all of them together-better than&#xD;
this Bryan Dempsey. I know you are his widow,&#xD;
and I feel really sorry for you; but I can do nothing&#xD;

for you while he follows me, and keeps pointing tc&#xD;
his throat and grinning so terribly. Mind I prom.&#xD;
ise you, on my word of honor as a gentleman and a&#xD;
Christian bishop, if you will keep your husband,&#xD;
away I will give you a beautiful farm, and never&#xD;
molest your children in their religion. Will you do&#xD;
this for me ? Papists profess to be charitable and&#xD;
forgiving-I will see now."&#xD;
The doctors whispered her to agree at once. "Of&#xD;
course I will do it fdr you," said the unhappy lady.&#xD;
And, hoping to humor him, she asked: "What would&#xD;
you think of taking a trip to England, my lord ?&#xD;
They say spirits cannot cross water, so they cannot&#xD;
follow you over sea."&#xD;
"I should like it very much, indeed; but you must&#xD;
accompany me, or your husband will not stay away."&#xD;
"Oh, certainly; I shall go with you everywhere."&#xD;
This assurance seemed to calm him, and he was&#xD;
permitted to sit in his easy-chair; but he would by&#xD;
no means suffer her to leave the room a moment.&#xD;
He evidently took her to be poor Winnie Dempsey,&#xD;
and imagined he was freed from the ghastly vision of&#xD;
Bryan's death while she was present. In about a&#xD;
week the doctors pronounced him fit to travel, and&#xD;
they left for London.&#xD;
As Miss Menville was lying in fever at the resi-&#xD;

&#xD;
dence of Mr. De Courcy while these scenes were&#xD;
transpiring, she was not aware of the arrival of' her&#xD;
aunt in Ireland. Mrs. Biggs, however, was duly&#xD;
waited upon by the housekeeper of Glengoulair Cas-&#xD;
tle, and, learning that her niece was a guest at Cas-&#xD;
cade house, deemed it beneath her dignity to pretend&#xD;
being aware of that circumstance; she therefore&#xD;
sent her no message, and left before she had recov-&#xD;
ered.&#xD;
When Lord Biggs and suite arrived in England&#xD;
they resided for a time in a fine mansion outside&#xD;
Greenwich, removed from all company or any ex-&#xD;
citemnent. The grounds were extensive and taste-&#xD;
fully laid out, the landscape around 'highly culti-&#xD;
vated, and every object inviting to repose. Here&#xD;
the bishop's health greatly improved, his paroxysms&#xD;
became less frequent,'and hopes were beginning to&#xD;
be entertained of his recovery, when a circumstance&#xD;
occurred which rendered those hopes fallacious.&#xD;
A large number of ejectment cases had been laid&#xD;
over from the last quarter sessions, in consequence&#xD;
of the landlord's illness, and Mr. Margin was at a loss&#xD;
to know how to proceed. Hearing that his lordship&#xD;
was rapidly recovering he wrote him for instructions&#xD;
several times; but receiving no reply'he pondered&#xD;
over the case and finally came to the determination&#xD;
&#xD;

<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC7337-00000169"/>&#xD;
of paying a visit to the invalid. He thought, too,&#xD;
that this act of courtesy would secure him future&#xD;
favors; so off he started in the month of May for&#xD;
London, with a bustling and important air, sending&#xD;
his bailiffs around before his departure to warn the&#xD;
unhappy tenantry to be prepared for the worst on his&#xD;
return. Fresh consternation and renewed tears were&#xD;
the result of those warnings.&#xD;
One lovely afternoon Lord Biggs was reclining&#xD;
in a large arm-chair on the lawn, enjoying the&#xD;
beauty of the evening and the charming landscape.&#xD;
lie had a portfolio of handsome engravings lying&#xD;
before him on a rustic table. His valet had just&#xD;
gone into the house for a few moments, when a turn&#xD;
in the avenue brought a new comer in sight. At&#xD;
first he seemed not to recognize the person, but a&#xD;
few rapid, strides brought Margin, bowing and&#xD;
scraping, face to face with his.lordship. The un-&#xD;
happy bishop trembled like an autumnal leaf at the&#xD;
presence of the unwelcome visitor; but wihen the&#xD;
agent, making another profound obeisance, inquired&#xD;
after his lordship's health, maniac lightning seemed&#xD;
to flash from the bishop's eyes-lie uttered a fierce&#xD;
growl and clutched Margin by the throat. Having,&#xD;
as before intimated, a diseased leg, and being taken&#xD;
unawares, Margin lost his balance and fell to the&#xD;

ground. The frantic Biggs jumped upon him and&#xD;
endeavored to strangle him. Margin screamed for&#xD;
his life, and the whole household rushing out he&#xD;
was saved from immediate death. But Lord Biggs's&#xD;
delirium returned in the most aggravated form.&#xD;
Mrs. Biggs bitterly upbraided Margin for presuming&#xD;
to speak to his lordship on business. He assured&#xD;
her he had not done so, and was merely commencing&#xD;
to inquire after his health when he fell upon him.&#xD;
"No wonder he should," she replied. "It was&#xD;
your bad counsels and worse acts that made him un-&#xD;
popular with his tenantry, and made them-reject the&#xD;
Book of Life and the liberal education offered to&#xD;
them and to their children."&#xD;
"Is this,. then, madam, the reward I receive for&#xD;
making the Glengoulah estates four times as valua-&#xD;
ble as they were under the agency of De Courcy?"&#xD;
"Olh, don't you speak of Mr. De Courcy. What-&#xD;
ever his faults were, lie was at least a gentleman."&#xD;
"Madam, you evidently do not understand the&#xD;
case; permit me to explain-"&#xD;

&#xD;
Choking with rage and mortification, Margin for&#xD;
the first time realized the truth of the proverb:&#xD;
"As you sow, so shall you reap."&#xD;
He returned to Glengoulah much more speedily than&#xD;
he had anticipated; and if not a better he was deci.&#xD;
dedly a much more ragged man; for his new coat,&#xD;
purchased expressly for the occasion, was torn to&#xD;
shreds in the scuffle with Biggs. He was observed&#xD;
to be very taciturn and crest-fallen after his return.&#xD;
The ejectment cases were again held over until next&#xD;
session, and the poor tenants, for a time at least, felt&#xD;
secure of a roof.&#xD;
The bishop became so untractable that he could&#xD;
not for a moment be left alone, as he attempted self&#xD;
destruction several times. The doctors again re.&#xD;
commended change of air and scene; so Mrs. Biggs,&#xD;
with their own physician, keepers from a lunatic&#xD;
asylum, servants, etc., left for Paris early in June&#xD;
and thence to different cities, crosshig into Bel,&#xD;
gium, thence to Germany, sailing up the Rhine, an J&#xD;
visiting every place of interest. All was in vain.&#xD;
Biggs seemed to become more frantic every new,&#xD;
place he arrived at. His lunacy, however, took&#xD;
different phases. Sometimes he would shako with&#xD;
terror and hide away in holes and corners from the&#xD;
victims of his avarice. Again he would imagine&#xD;
&#xD;
I.&#xD;
&#xD;
330&#xD;
&#xD;
331&#xD;
&#xD;
himself in the plenitude of his power ordering their&#xD;
arrest, and swearing to wipe out the whole Papist&#xD;
brood, and colonize his estate w i th Protestants.&#xD;
Through all his language. was a mixture .of blas-&#xD;
pheiny and Pharisaical cant. He would curse priests&#xD;
and people ; but his heaviest maledictions were re-&#xD;
rerved for Margin,- whomn ihe cursed in all moods,&#xD;
and vowed to exterminate rout and branch, as soon&#xD;
as he returned. Finding change of scene ineffec-&#xD;
tual, they came back to England about the end of&#xD;
August.&#xD;
A final consultation being held by the doctors,&#xD;
they recommended that he should be placed under&#xD;
the discipline of a private lunatic asylum immedi-&#xD;
ately. This advice was forthwith acted upon, and&#xD;
the result was it terminated his madness and his life&#xD;
before the end of the following month. In the last&#xD;
week of September, just asthe rent-day came on,&#xD;
strapped to an iron bedstead in a mad house, the&#xD;
unhappy sinner died! His last words were a male-&#xD;
diction on Margin.&#xD;
How iriscrutible are the ways of Providence I&#xD;
How just His retributions! This was the end of all&#xD;
for him the fame of whose cruelties rang through&#xD;
all Europe!&#xD;

Bishop of Glengoulah and Ardmore-the stroke of&#xD;

crowded towns to perish of want, to the emigrant&#xD;
ship, and to the grave !-there he lies dead in the&#xD;
cell of a mad-house, chained like a dog to an iron&#xD;
bed! Dead! without one friendly voice to soothe&#xD;
his last moments! Dead ! without kith or kin to&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIX.&#xD;
ONE clear, balmy morning in October, in that sea-&#xD;
son which is poetically called in Ireland "The poor&#xD;
man's harvest," a woman of prepossessing and still&#xD;
youthful appearance, dressed in an humble garb of&#xD;
black, and holding by the hand a little girl with&#xD;
fair, clustering curls, 'was sitting in the parlor of the&#xD;
Presentation Convent of Ardmore. Soon a beauti-&#xD;
ful young lady entered, attired in the dress of a pos-&#xD;
tulant of that order. Her soft, hazel eyes were lit&#xD;
up with a smile of pleasure as she caught sight of&#xD;
the widow, who immediately arose and courtesied.&#xD;
The young postulant exclaimed: "My dear Win-&#xD;
nie, I am so glad to see you! and this is your little&#xD;
Maiy?"   She took Winnie's toil-worn fingers be-&#xD;
t'ween her soft, white hands as she spoke, and then&#xD;
patted the child's golden curls.&#xD;
"You were so good, miss, as to invite me to come&#xD;
to see you! And some of the neighbors told me you&#xD;
would be soon going to England again, so I took the&#xD;
liberty of asking for you."&#xD;

" Win nie," said the young lady, earnestly, "have&#xD;
you heard the news froni England '?"&#xD;
"cYes, miss ; I heard it.'- God pity us all ! In-&#xD;
deed, indeed, Miss Clara, I felt heart sorry for you!&#xD;
Poor Clara covered her face with her hands, and&#xD;
Winnie wept in sympathy.&#xD;
" Al, Winnie, what a4 contrast ! Which of them&#xD;
was the r'icher man ? You lmaec evcrv reason to be-&#xD;
I ieve your dear husband is in heaven with God and&#xD;
his saints forevermore ; but my wretched, wretched&#xD;
uncle died in his sins!"&#xD;
" Oh, Miss Clara, dear! don't grieve your noble&#xD;
heart for one so unworthy. Sure, if he took your&#xD;
advice, o' any oine's wi thI a conscience, it's live and&#xD;
happy he'd be to-day. And ~they say many's the&#xD;
warn in' he got to let the 1)001' alone, but he would-n't&#xD;
heed them, and their cries pierced the heavens at&#xD;
last. My heart aches to see an angel like you shed-&#xD;
ding a tear for him&#xD;
"It is because of his life of crime, Winnie, that I&#xD;
cannot help weeping for his miserable death. Re-&#xD;
member, Winnie, his soul was created to God's im-&#xD;
age. Oh, what a disfigured image lie made of it!&#xD;
".That's just the way my father feels when he&#xD;
speaks of his death. Ie mourns for his soul as if all&#xD;
belongin' to him was laid low. Sure, I know it's the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
right feelin', and I ought to think of these things too&#xD;
but oh, Miss Clara,dear! pray God to forgive mne. I&#xD;
can't for my life think of him but I think of my&#xD;
peaceable, happy home, if it was poor; and of the&#xD;
hearty laugh my poor darlin' was givin' when the&#xD;
)eeler darkened our door ! Oh ! vo, vo, vo ! A laugh&#xD;
will never be heard there more ! Oh, Miss, honey !&#xD;
why did he choose out the purest and best man that&#xD;
ever lived, and persecute him to the gallo\vs?"&#xD;
Winnie was in one of her pa'oxysns of grief at&#xD;
the recollection of her devoted husband. She wrung&#xD;
her hands and raised her eyes to heaven in the aban-&#xD;
doninent of sorrow. Clara was awed into silence at&#xD;
this outbreak, so natural and so touching. She had&#xD;
never before seen such a manifbstation of woe, and&#xD;
it added another link to the cIaLin of evidence every&#xD;
day growing stronger on her mind that the Irish&#xD;
were a people of the deepest feelings. She did not&#xD;
dare interrupt a sorrow so sacred. After a while&#xD;
Winnie came over to ask her pardon. She said her&#xD;
heart was overcharged, and she could not control&#xD;
herself.&#xD;
" Indeed, my poor child !" she said, taking the&#xD;
widow's hands in both her own, "I am very far&#xD;
from condemning your feelings ; but, Winnie, I have&#xD;
not told you the news about myself. I have become&#xD;

an inmate of this convent; yes, indeed." And she&#xD;
smiled at Winnie's blank look of amazement.&#xD;
"I am going to be a nun, please God. And do&#xD;
you know the favor Mother Prioress has granted&#xD;
me ? I am to be called, in religion, Sister Norah. I&#xD;
wish to bear while I live the name of that dear child&#xD;
who first brought the dawn of faith to my darkened&#xD;
soul."&#xD;
"And you are not going back to England, miss?&#xD;
And you are, for sure, going to stay with us here in&#xD;
Ardmore ! "&#xD;
"For sure and certain, Winnie. I wrote to papa&#xD;
for permission-he is in Rome; and from the f'av-&#xD;
orable answer I received I have very strong hopes,&#xD;
through God's mercy, that he too will soon be re-&#xD;
ceived into the Church. He is about being con-&#xD;
verted. Now is not this delightful news? See how&#xD;
sweetly our Heavenly Father dispenses to us joys&#xD;
and sorrows, both alike to draw us to himself.&#xD;
And now, when your little Mary is old enough to&#xD;
come to school, Sister Norah will be her teacher ;&#xD;
meantime you must all pray to the Blessed Mother&#xD;
to obtain for me the grace of perseverance."&#xD;
Winnie felt happier that day than she had done&#xD;
since Bryan's death. She hastened home to com-&#xD;
municate the joyful intelligence to her parents, and&#xD;
&#xD;
s&#xD;
&#xD;
great were the rejoicings all through Glengoulah,&#xD;
Tinmanogue and Ardmore when it was known that&#xD;
the beautiful young English lady had become a&#xD;
nun.&#xD;
A few days later it was announced that the Glen-&#xD;
goulah estates- had become the property of George&#xD;
Bentley, Esq., the nearest heir-at-law to the departed&#xD;
bishop. He was a country gentleman in England,&#xD;
having much property there, and being an excellent&#xD;
landlord he felt ashamed of the unenviable notoriety&#xD;
acquired by his predecessor, and was determined to&#xD;
leave nothing undone to repair the scandals now the&#xD;
topic of general conversation. He betook himself to&#xD;
Glengoulah Castle as soon as possible, and set about&#xD;
seeking testimony from. both sides as to the cherac-&#xD;
ter of the tenantry, the treatment to vhich they were&#xD;
subjected by both agents, the relative condition of&#xD;
the estates under the past and present regime) etc.,&#xD;
etc. His cousin, Clara. Menville, now Sister Norah,&#xD;
of the Presentation convent, gave him valuable aid&#xD;
in his inquiries. He visited the farms himself, and&#xD;
conversed with many of the tenantry-sent for some&#xD;
of the dispossessed, and.promised to reinstate them&#xD;
if their conduct bore. the investigation he designed&#xD;
making. Margin was the first to pay court to the&#xD;
new landlord. Mr. Bentley received him  courte-&#xD;

&#xD;
ously, for lie resolved to be perfectly unbiased in his&#xD;
judgment, and invited all, agent and tenant alike, to&#xD;
lay their grievances before him. Margin did not&#xD;
much relish this state of things, but lie determined&#xD;
to have the first statement, and thus try to create a&#xD;
favorable impression of himself in the mind of Mr.&#xD;
Bentley. Accordingly he drew a frightful picture of&#xD;
insubordination, bigotry, lawless violence, arising&#xD;
from treating with too much kindness a people who&#xD;
were unable to appreciate it, always requiring a&#xD;
strong hand over them, or they would be sure to end&#xD;
in arson, or, probably, assassination.&#xD;
Mr. Bentley listened' attentively, made copious&#xD;
notes, but uttered no word of comment. Margin&#xD;
had strong hopes lie would mar the evidence of his&#xD;
opponents by this timely eloquence, and corrobo-&#xD;
rated all his statements by a written document&#xD;
signed by those political fanatics who made them-&#xD;
selves so conspicuous on the trial of Bryan Demp-&#xD;
sey, and by the honorable and truthful Sandy Me-&#xD;
Glauren.&#xD;
Unluckily for Mr. Margin, about this juncture&#xD;
Lord Wallingford returned from a lengthened so-&#xD;
journ on the continent to the great delight of his&#xD;
tenantry, who strewed the roads with green boughs,&#xD;
and would have taken the horses froi his carriage&#xD;
&#xD;
and drawn him home as in a' triumphal car, but he&#xD;
would not allow it. Arcades of flowers were formed&#xD;
in every village through which he passed, even in&#xD;
those places where the people had not the good for-&#xD;
tune to own him for a landlord. Such was the ad-&#xD;
miration and respect felt for a good man, who was&#xD;
always actuated by a sense of justice. About a&#xD;
week after this arrival a card, announcing a visit&#xD;
from Lord Wallingford, was handed to Mr. Bentley&#xD;
at the castle. They met in the library, and his&#xD;
lordship greeted Mr. Bentley most cordially and&#xD;
welcomed him to the county. After some general&#xD;
conversation, Lord Wallingford said: "You have a&#xD;
splendid property here, Mr. Beiitley."&#xD;
"Yes; but I was half afraid to take possession of&#xD;
it. I do assure your lordship, it required no small&#xD;
amount of both moral and physical courage to face&#xD;
the terrible dangers predicted for me by my friends&#xD;
in England, maiming for life being among the small-&#xD;
est. I take credit to myself for being a most valiant&#xD;
knight, and doubt not, if I lived in the ages of chiv-&#xD;
alry, I should have'won my golden spurs while yet&#xD;
a stripling."&#xD;
"Your danger or safety, Mr. Bentley, depends&#xD;
entirely on yourself. I speak to you candidly, as&#xD;
one man of honor should to another. You have&#xD;

come to reside among a people of deep passions and&#xD;
warm affections-a people keenly alive to a sense&#xD;
of wrong, but so long loaded down with oppression&#xD;
as to receive as favors and repay with sincerest&#xD;
gratitude those common acts of justice which you&#xD;
are every day accustomed to render to your English&#xD;
tenantry, and which they expect as a right. You&#xD;
will find plenty to convey to you a very different&#xD;
character of this people, but if you are the man of&#xD;
sense and honor I take you to be you will not allow&#xD;
your judgment to be warped."&#xD;
"But you forget, my lord, that I am a stranger.&#xD;
How am I to judge, except by the testimony of re-&#xD;
liable witnesses? Quite lately I was honored by&#xD;
two statements - one made in writing, and one&#xD;
in language of surpassing eloquence-by gentlemen&#xD;
whose veracity they assure m has never been called&#xD;
in question excepting by a low rabble, who ought&#xD;
to have been hanged long ago if they had their&#xD;
merit. .Those gentlemen seem to be equally con-&#xD;
versant with the value of sheep and pure Bible edu-&#xD;
cation, green crops and Popery, while they know&#xD;
every turn of a peasant's mind, and can read his&#xD;
motives- better than he can himself. Would you&#xD;
have me insensible to the advantage of possessing&#xD;
such a mine of information ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Lord Wallingford, seeing the smile which played&#xD;
on Mr. Bentley's face, joined with the quiet sarcasm&#xD;
of his words, found that lie was one not likely to be&#xD;
turned from the path of rectitude, and that the cause&#xD;
of the long-suffering people would be safe in his&#xD;
hands. Smiling, he said : " I see, Mr. Bentley, you&#xD;
are a man of penetration. Have you seen Margin,&#xD;
the agent, yet?"&#xD;
"Why, my lord, he did me the honor of introduc-&#xD;
ing himself this morning, after my arrival. He is&#xD;
the gentleman to whose moving eloquence I alluded&#xD;
just now, and from whose inexhaustible mine of&#xD;
information I expect such valuable aids to the acqui-&#xD;
sition of wealth."&#xD;
"And he really had the effrontery to look an hon-&#xD;
est man in the face ? Your allusion to mines, in&#xD;
connection with his name, is more apropos than you&#xD;
are aware of. Did you know that he had a lawsuit&#xD;
with me, Mr. Bentley,.respecting the mines of Coold-&#xD;
nure ? "&#xD;
" No, my lord; but I shall consider myself your&#xD;
lordship's debtor if you will kindly inform me of&#xD;
the transaction.&#xD;

we have already laid before our readers of Jacob&#xD;

the rascal's character, and the transformation effected&#xD;
on the Glengoulah estates since he became agent-&#xD;
Mr. Benttley's open smile vanished, and a dark cloud&#xD;
of indigination overspread h is manly countenance,&#xD;
as Lord Wallingford proceeded with his narrative.&#xD;
" I thank you most heartily, my lord, for this in-&#xD;
formation; it shall not be lost upon me. Do you&#xD;
know a man named O'Hara, who lives in this neigh-&#xD;
borhood-Jeremiah O'Hlara ?- I believe he is lame."&#xD;
" Oh, yes; 'Lame Jerry' they call him-an hon-&#xD;
est, outspoken poor man he was when I left home,&#xD;
and a genius in his way."&#xD;
"A man of surprising information for a peasant.&#xD;
I had a long interview with him yesterday, and he&#xD;
really gave me more insight into the state of affaiirs&#xD;
in Glengoulali than any one I spoke with until I had&#xD;
the good fortune to meet your lordship. You will, I&#xD;
trust, pardon the comparison."&#xD;
"Pardon ! my good friend; you do me quite an'&#xD;
honor. Why, ' Lame Jerry' is one of the natural&#xD;
curiosities of the County Wicklow ; and a tourist&#xD;
might as well leave the country without seeing St.&#xD;
Kevin's bed, or&#xD;
'Glendalough, whose gloomy shore&#xD;
Sky lark never warbled o'er,'&#xD;
as without hearing the poetic legends of Lame Jer&#xD;
&#xD;
ry; besides this, he possesses a large stook'of historic&#xD;
lore, and a perfect knowledge of the condition of&#xD;
landlord and tenant in nearly all the countries of&#xD;
Europe. Jerry is the oracle of at least three coun-&#xD;
ties. Ie lost a leg at Waterloo, for which he re-&#xD;
ceives a small pension from Government."&#xD;
"'Ahi! I see you are not- aware, my lord, that he&#xD;
has been deprived of that trifle."&#xD;
" No ! Mr. Bentley!- you are not serious ?"&#xD;
" Yes, indeed ! The poor man assured me lie had&#xD;
been describing to a number of peasanhty one eve-&#xD;
?ninlg, sitting in a group on the road-side, the condi-&#xD;
tion of- the Russian serfs, and its vast superiority&#xD;
over their own, when lie discovered that the Scotch&#xD;
steward- had been playing eavesdropper. -Shortly&#xD;
after this Margin trumped up some charge against&#xD;
him. of conspiracy, or some other folly, and the poor&#xD;
man's pension was withdrawn, the learned judge&#xD;
assuring him lie was very leniently dealt with in&#xD;
consequence of having but one leg."&#xD;
Oh ! shame, shame !   however, Jerry shall&#xD;
never need their pension while I live."&#xD;

lie wants for nothing, and never knew before how&#xD;

Mr. Bentley wrote Margin from England to notify&#xD;
the tenants that lie would not require the March&#xD;
rent to. be paid until the third week of May, and&#xD;
that they should then meet him at Glengoulah Cas-&#xD;
tle, as he intended~giving them a collation on the&#xD;
lawn, thus introducing himself to all of them in&#xD;
person. He also invited Margin, Sandy M'Glauren,&#xD;
and all the bailiffs, Bible readers, etc., etc., formerly&#xD;
in the employ of his predecessor.&#xD;
Margin sent the notification around only on the&#xD;
eve of rent-day. He never performed a more dis-&#xD;
tasteful task, and put it off until the last moment.&#xD;
The invitation .angered well, and high hopes&#xD;
began once more to take possession of hearts where&#xD;
only despair had so long dwelt. Still the people&#xD;
felt a little disappointed that Margin was retained&#xD;
as agent, but consoled themselves with the hope&#xD;
that he would be at least shorn of the power to do&#xD;
evil any more.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
MAY came at last, and with the daisies and prim-&#xD;
roses came the summons to the landlord's entertain-&#xD;
ment. The castle and lawn presented a gay appear.&#xD;
an ce. An un in ense marquee was erected, underneath&#xD;
which long tables were spread, covered with sub-&#xD;
stantials of every variety. Pipers and fid:lers, in the&#xD;
midst of groups, were dispersed through the tent&#xD;
and lawn ; but the chair of honor was reserved for&#xD;
Darby W 1 iolal ian. It was an old-faslhioned high-&#xD;
backed chair, placed on an elevation, festooned with&#xD;
evergreens and flowers, and was arranged at the head&#xD;
of the tent under a clump of larch-trees that trailed&#xD;
their graceful branches like a bower on either side&#xD;
of him, and where all could see him when the can,"&#xD;
vas was rolled up.&#xD;
When the repast was finished, Mr. Bentley, accom-&#xD;
panied by Mr. De Courcy, entered the tent, and was&#xD;
introduced to the tenantry by their old and loved&#xD;
agent. Baskets of wine were opened on all sides,&#xD;
and landlord, tenants and all drank health, long-Life&#xD;
and happiness to each other in flowing bumpers. A&#xD;
&#xD;
party of gentlemen from the surrounding and neigh-&#xD;
boring county came in, including 'Sir Lawrence&#xD;
O'Donnell and Lord Wallingford, and pleasant greet-&#xD;
ings were exchanged. To Toney Byrne, whom the&#xD;
neighbors had placed at the head of the centre-table&#xD;
-in spite of all his entreaties-they paid sp. cial at-&#xD;
tent ion. Mr. lentley jumped lightly on a bench and&#xD;
addessed the people:&#xD;
"Men of Gleingoulah: I invited you here to-day&#xD;
for a threefold purpose. First, that we nliht all&#xD;
become acquainted with each other ; secondly, that&#xD;
I might try to do justice where so much necessity&#xD;
for it existed ; and thirdly, that I would see you en-&#xD;
joy yourselves. We Englishmen are said to be very&#xD;
gruff fellows ; bu' I beg to assure you that I an a very&#xD;
sociable character, not at all long-faced, but on the&#xD;
contrary a great admirer of rational amnuseinents,&#xD;
and a believer in the old adage that 'God loves a&#xD;
cheerful heart.' You see, though a very modest&#xD;
man, I can sound my own praises. I feel confident&#xD;
when we become better acquainted we shall feel for&#xD;
each other that esteem and affection which should&#xD;
exist between a good landlord and worthy tenantry,&#xD;
somewhat resembling the'ties of mutual love and&#xD;
respect existing between a father and his children.&#xD;

attached ; but as I have not the gift of ubiquity, I&#xD;
have decided upon residing every alternate year in&#xD;
Ireland and England. Having said so much by&#xD;
way of introducing myself; I shall now refer to my&#xD;
second object in calling you around me.&#xD;
"Men of Glengoulali, I have made the most mi-&#xD;
nute investigations in your regard, and am quite sat-&#xD;
isfied you have been a maligned and misrepresented&#xD;
people. You have suffered much for some years&#xD;
past, and it is but fair to reward those who merit it.&#xD;
To all my tenantry I give an abatement of twenty-&#xD;
five per cent.; to some, who have been more especially&#xD;
imposed upon, and whose cases will receive imne-&#xD;
diate attention, a further abatement will be made."&#xD;
(A burst of cheers rang through hill and dale.)&#xD;
"Anthony Byrne, I beg to inform you that you&#xD;
shall be fully reinstated in your old farm, which&#xD;
shall be newly stocked, to compensate you in some&#xD;
small degree for the injustice you suffered and bore&#xD;
so admirably. Any alterations you deem necessary&#xD;
in the new house, which was erected after the fire,&#xD;
shall be made at my expense. For your eldest son,&#xD;
who is now old enough to do for himself, I have a&#xD;
choice farm; and for your daughter-the widow of&#xD;
poor Dempsey-I have ordered an annuity to be set-&#xD;
tled upon her and her heirs foi'ever." Cheer after&#xD;
&#xD;
848&#xD;
&#xD;
cheer broke forth, and the old hills gave back the&#xD;
echoes oft renewed. Toney Byrne stood up- and&#xD;
made vain efforts to speak ; but the tears which&#xD;
coursed down his cheeks were more eloquent than&#xD;
words. Mr. Bentley -resumed: "These are only&#xD;
acts of simple justice, my friends, and not worth&#xD;
thanking for. Every injustice on my estates shall&#xD;
be repaired. Mr. Margin will please come forward.&#xD;
Jacob Margin, I arraign you before the tribunal of&#xD;
a people whose sacred rights you have trampled up-&#xD;
on, whose holiest feelings you have outraged, whose&#xD;
homes you have made desolate or .levelled with the&#xD;
dust."&#xD;
" I was but the servant of your right reverend&#xD;
relation, Mr. Bentley. I only followed my orders!"&#xD;
exclaimed Margin, sneeringly.&#xD;
"Peace, man! I know your antecedent'. You&#xD;
had sent your victims to the penal colony, and to&#xD;
the gallows, before you laid eyes on the Glengoulah&#xD;
estates. I do not seek to justify thernemor~y of my&#xD;
unfortunate predecessor; but I know who was his&#xD;
evil counsellor and his willing tool. In the presence&#xD;
of the people I dismiss you in disgrace. You are&#xD;
no longer agent of mine. I also dismiss your co-&#xD;
league, Sandy McGlauren, and all your troop of&#xD;
cormorants, bailiffs, Bible-readers, and the- rest&#xD;

&#xD;
You, Margin, are an old mn, and I advise you to&#xD;
repent of your misdeeds arid~make restitution."&#xD;
Margin quickly disappeared. Silence reigned for&#xD;
a few moments. Though brimful of joy at the an-&#xD;
nouncement, no voice was raised in triumph. With&#xD;
that instinctive delicacy which is pre-eimminently the&#xD;
characteristic of the Irish people, they refrained&#xD;
from rejoicing over a fallen foe. Mr. Bentley re-&#xD;
sumed : " I have the happiness to announce to you&#xD;
that Mr. De Courcy "-at the mention of that hon-&#xD;
ored name all sprang to their feet, and cheer after&#xD;
cheer echoed and re-echoed through the hills-" Mr.&#xD;
De Courcy, who loves you all as his children."&#xD;
Again the wild cheers broke forth, and the, people&#xD;
seemed perfectly crazy. Mr. Rentley, laughing,&#xD;
said : " I see I cannot name that name. Well, a&#xD;
certain gentleman has resigned his seat in Parlia-&#xD;
ment, where he long and vainly strove to obtain a&#xD;
fair settlement of the landlord and tenant question,&#xD;
and prefers again to become a quiet country gentle-&#xD;
man, living at peace amongst those who love him,&#xD;
and     " Iere his voice was drowned ire cheers&#xD;
and shouts from several parties.&#xD;
"God bless him, and you too, Mr. Bentley!"&#xD;
" Long life to ye both !"  " That you may never die.&#xD;
at all.!"&#xD;
&#xD;
350&#xD;
&#xD;
351&#xD;
&#xD;
"1 see you are not willing to listen to me."&#xD;
A stentorian voice shouted: "Boys, give three rale&#xD;
Irish cheers and a cead millefailtha for Mr. Bentley,&#xD;
our good laud lord ! " These were given with a hearty&#xD;
good will, throwing up of hats, and the wildest en-&#xD;
tlsiasmn.&#xD;
"Now boys," cried the same voice, shouldd your&#xD;
tongues. Not another word. Let the gentleman&#xD;
spake.&#xD;
"I often heard," resumed Mr. Bentley, "of an.&#xD;
Irish cheer; but now I understand what it is."&#xD;
" I have not much more to say. Mr. De Courcy&#xD;
has done me a great favor in accepting the agency&#xD;
of these estates. It is to him a labor of love, he&#xD;
says, and I know you will all appreciate his kind-&#xD;
ness in saying so. He is not only my agent, but my&#xD;
most valued aid honored friend. The property shall&#xD;
be entirely controlled by his wise head, who knows&#xD;
the necessities and capacities of the tenantry.. I now&#xD;
want to see you enjoy yourselves in dancing, and all&#xD;
your national pastimes."&#xD;
There were loud calls for Mr. De Courcy, but he&#xD;
merely bowed and smiled his acknowledgments,&#xD;
while they drank his health and rent the air with&#xD;
cheers. When he retired, Lame Jerry arose and&#xD;
begged "before the dancing commenced, that every&#xD;

&#xD;
one should fill their glasses and drink long life and&#xD;
every prosperity and happiness to their respected&#xD;
neighbor and loved friend, Anthony O'Byrne, the&#xD;
old chieftaim of Glengoulah."  Again the old hills&#xD;
gave back the echo of the oft-renewed cheers which&#xD;
seemed never - ending, when Darby Wholahan&#xD;
jumped up, rolling his sightless eyes around, ex-&#xD;
claiming:&#xD;
" Boys, I'm going to improvise." [Cries of" Bravo,&#xD;
Da'rby! it's yourself can do it! "] "I am going, I&#xD;
say, to improvise. Most of yees knows what that&#xD;
manes ; but, lest there should be any gorsoons whose&#xD;
powers of discrimination are not nately developed,&#xD;
I'll translate it for their edification. I said, I was&#xD;
going to improvise. Now that manes, my young&#xD;
friends, I'm going to compose a song for this truly&#xD;
festive occasion, illustrative of the bards of old in&#xD;
the ancient halls of our forefathers. I shall also im-&#xD;
provise an air upon my ancient instrument-the&#xD;
pipes." [" Bravo! Long life to Darby Wholahan,&#xD;
the king of pipers; the best musician in the barony!&#xD;
aye, or in the whole county, for that matter !"&#xD;
Darby sat down and flourished a number of chords&#xD;
with great rapidity, then struck a particular key ;&#xD;
and gazing upward, as if reviewing the past, present&#xD;
and future in the light of the soul, he broke forth in&#xD;
&#xD;
352&#xD;
&#xD;
a wild but most harmonious recitative of the ancient&#xD;
glories of "Green Erin of the Streams "-her ages&#xD;
of martyrdom and long-sufferings for the faith of&#xD;
Christ, the valiant deeds of her sons, foremost among&#xD;
whom was the gallant O'Byrne of Glengoulah. He&#xD;
then touched on the penal laws, their disinheriting&#xD;
effects and consequent impoverishment of the old&#xD;
Celtic race, shoving them out by wholesale and in-&#xD;
troducing in their stead the Sassenach, some of whom&#xD;
were as bad as the evil one could make them, but&#xD;
whose wicked deeds we would pass over to-day in&#xD;
honor of him who would become "more Irish than&#xD;
the Irish themselves," and under whose benign sway&#xD;
the lovely hills and vales of their country, so cele-&#xD;
brated in song and story, would again resound with&#xD;
the joyous laugh and merry dance-where the poor&#xD;
and the stranger would ever find a welcome, and the&#xD;
bard be honored as in days of yore!&#xD;
He ceased. During the recitative a number of&#xD;
gentlemen from the castle stole on tip-toe, one by&#xD;
one, into the tent, and listened delightedly. Now&#xD;
cheers, bravos and compliments flowed in upon all&#xD;
sides. Mr. Bentley and-many other gentlemen came&#xD;
forward as he ceased, to shake by the hand a bard&#xD;
who combined poet and musician in his own person.&#xD;
Mir. Bentley requested "that Mr. Wholahan would&#xD;

call and see him at the castle on his next visit to&#xD;
Glengoulah. By that time he expected Mrs. Bent.&#xD;
ley and his family there, and as his wife was some-&#xD;
what of a musician herself, she would be pleased to&#xD;
meet a genius like Mr. Wholahan," etc. A proud&#xD;
and happy man.was Darby that night. Such tones&#xD;
as he brought out of the pipes were never before&#xD;
heard by mortal ears. As our droll friend Tom&#xD;
Moody said: "It would make a cat spake to see the&#xD;
humors of the ould head joggin' from sideto side,&#xD;
now smilin' down at the pipes, and then snuffin' up&#xD;
at the stars."&#xD;
It was indeed a most entrancing sight. The sun&#xD;
had sunk behind the western hills, but the sapphire&#xD;
and golden tints which accompanied his declining&#xD;
course were still spread far over the firmament, while&#xD;
the moon, sailing slowly and majestically onward,&#xD;
threw a flood of silver radiance on the old woods&#xD;
skirting the noble lawn, and shed a trail of glitter-&#xD;
ing spangles on the bosom of the Ovoca. Groups&#xD;
of happy boys and girls footed away right merrily&#xD;
"The Rocky Road to Dublin," "Lather the Wig,"&#xD;
Trip to the Cottage," etc., on the smooth velvet&#xD;
turf. Occasionally Darby's voice could be heard:&#xD;
"That's yourself, Mick; but it's no wonder you&#xD;
do it so nately with such a partner! Sure, Bessie&#xD;
&#xD;
'&#xD;
I  k&#xD;
&#xD;
Daily wouldn't hurt a bunch of primroses if she&#xD;
danced on them, her step is .so light. Ah, Bessie,&#xD;
you decavin' rogue ! though you tread so lightly on&#xD;
the turf, upon my conscience you're hard enough&#xD;
upon  the boys' hearts !"  " Why, then, Mrs. Fogar-&#xD;
ty ! is that your voice I hear; and is it only looking&#xD;
on you are-you that could bate seven baronies at&#xD;
the dance ?"  " Bedad, it's the truth you're spakin',&#xD;
Mr. Wholahan. Come out here, Mrs. Fogarty, and&#xD;
let us show these youngsters what dancin' was in our&#xD;
day. Oh, by the powers of Moll Kelley, I'll take&#xD;
no excuse. Sure, it's many a time we danced to-&#xD;
gether before either of is was married, and I'll be&#xD;
bound we have the old kick in our foot yet. What's&#xD;
your favorite, ma'am? Bedad, you must have it !&#xD;
Darby, give us ' The New Married Bride !' and now&#xD;
clear the road, boys ?"&#xD;
Such were the scenes of merriment all around.&#xD;
Between ten and eleven o'clock they began to wend&#xD;
their way homeward, with bounding steps and glee-&#xD;
some jokes, betokening hearts awaking to a sense&#xD;
of happiness and contentment.-&#xD;

CONCLUSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
ANOTHER year flew by, and once more the vines&#xD;
and flowers in her old home were tended by the&#xD;
careful hand of Winnie. The children played among&#xD;
the flower-beds in front of the handsome, capacious&#xD;
cottage erected by the late Bishop Biggs for Sandy&#xD;
McGlauren.&#xD;
Retribution had at last overtaken the whole troop&#xD;
of vampires. The same day that Toney Byrne took&#xD;
possession of his old farm, the soul of Jacob Margin&#xD;
was brought before the bar of Eternal Justice. He&#xD;
died of putrid fever after seven days' sickness, at&#xD;
his residence, Fawnbrook Lodge.. Three days after-&#xD;
ward a stately hearse, with nodding plumes, and&#xD;
half a dozen carriages, accompanied his remains to.&#xD;
the Protestant church-yard of Ardmore. A few&#xD;
miserable outcasts, whom his tyranny had made&#xD;
desperate, flung stones at the hearse and cursed tho&#xD;
senseless clay as it passed along ; but the majority&#xD;
of the people shook their heads in horror, and, get-&#xD;
ting out of the way, crossed themselves, and invoked&#xD;
a prayer to be delivered from the evil one. Such was&#xD;
&#xD;
the end of Jacob Margin. It was said not even one&#xD;
of his own relatives ever shed a tear for him. He&#xD;
went to his grave "unwept, unpitied," and but too&#xD;
well known.&#xD;
Sandy McGlauren went back to Scotland, a richer&#xD;
if not a wiser man ; while Faulkner, the Bible-&#xD;
reader, and his- confreres, betook themselves to&#xD;
" White Friar's Hall," to shout for Thresham Gregg&#xD;
and the Dublin Corporation.&#xD;
Mr. De Courcy, when he had the affairs of the es-&#xD;
tate restored to their 'omiier order, and saw the peo-&#xD;
ple once more contented and happy, took with his&#xD;
family a t(our on the continent, which he had long&#xD;
contemplated. About six months after his depart-&#xD;
ure little Mary Dempsey came hone from school&#xD;
earlier than usual one day, and throwing her arms&#xD;
around the neck of her grandfather, with whom she&#xD;
was a great pet, exclaimed : ".Oh, grandaddy! I&#xD;
have the greatest news for you ! We were all dis-&#xD;
missed from school to-day at twelve o'clock. First,&#xD;
we were broughtto the chapel to join in a Te Deum&#xD;
that all the nuns sang in thanksgiving to God. Sis-&#xD;
ter Norah played the organ ; but she could not sing:&#xD;
her voice was choked with sobs. She told me to tell&#xD;
yon in particular the news she had heard. Now what&#xD;
will you give me if I tell you?" and the young&#xD;

rogue peered laughingly into his face. Her grand.&#xD;
father fondled the little prattler and stroked her fair&#xD;
curls. Then he said:&#xD;
" I wont give anything. I don't care to-hear it!"&#xD;
"Yes, you do, you bad old grandaddy ! You'd&#xD;
give ever so much to hear itt!"&#xD;
"Well, I'll give you a kiss."&#xD;
"Oh, I'll get plenty of them without telling any.&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"Well, then, I'll buy you a pretty picture the&#xD;
next time I go to Ardmore."&#xD;
" Will you, for sure and certain "&#xD;
"For sure and certain."&#xD;
"Then I'll tell you. Sister Norah got a letter&#xD;
from Rome this morning, from her father, telling her&#xD;
he had become a Catholic; and on the same day and&#xD;
in the same church our own Mr. De Courcy and all&#xD;
his family were baptized, and all made their first&#xD;
communion. Now, grandfather, isn't that good&#xD;
news?"&#xD;
Toney Byrne did not utter a word-he raised his&#xD;
hands and eyes to heaven, and going into his room&#xD;
knelt down. The child saw the large tears stream..&#xD;
mg down his cheeks, and she ran off to find her&#xD;
mother and grandmother and communicate the joy-&#xD;
ful intelligence. Soon it was over the whole coun-&#xD;
&#xD;
358&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
try, and from every hill-top that night bonfires blazed&#xD;
and groups danced merrily around them. Every&#xD;
old flute and fiddle ever scratched was brought forth&#xD;
and put in requisition for the dance, and when all&#xD;
instruments failed the best whistler or jigger took&#xD;
up the tune and footed it with right good will until&#xD;
the near approach of midnight.&#xD;
On any Sunday morning early, long before the&#xD;
chapel-bell of Tinmanogue gives warning that the&#xD;
holy mass will soon commence, if you chance to be&#xD;
passing and peer through the sweet-briar hedge&#xD;
among the peaceful graves, you will not fail to see a&#xD;
pensive woman of prepossessing appearance, dressed&#xD;
in plain black, surrounded by a group of hushed&#xD;
children, kneeling around a grave which she fre-&#xD;
quently stoops to kiss and bedew with her tears.&#xD;
And "Aft in the simmer eve's gloamin' " the&#xD;
same figure may be observed (attended by one or&#xD;
other of her children, and sometimes by an old man)&#xD;
plucking the withered leaves from the rose bushes&#xD;
which hang lovingly over the cross at the head of&#xD;
the grave, or carefully removing the weeds from the&#xD;
well-kept turf studded with daisies. Would you&#xD;
know who sleeps beneath ? Then read the inscrip-&#xD;

"Glengoulah forever mourns her youthful martyrI "&#xD;
Watch the movements of this mourner a little&#xD;
longer and you will see her proceed to another&#xD;
grave, upon which she bestows equal care, and fer-&#xD;
vently kisses the green sod, praying-all the while.&#xD;
A box tomb of Carrara marble stands at the head&#xD;
of this grave. On the top of the tomb two angels,&#xD;
finely carved, hold between them an immortal crown,&#xD;
and seem already on the wing for realms of bliss.&#xD;
The inscription reads thus :&#xD;
ERECTED BY HIS SORROWING PARISHIONERS,&#xD;
TO THE MEMORY OF&#xD;
REV. EUGENE PATRICK ESMOND,&#xD;
FOR FIFTY-SIX YEARS&#xD;
FATHER, FRIEND, COUNSELLOR, AND PASTOR OF GLENGOULAH,&#xD;
Died a Martyr to Charity, February 20th, 1846, Aged 98 Years.&#xD;

These graves and her children are the great charge&#xD;
of Winnie's life.  The white marble slab over Bryan&#xD;
was the gift of Clara Menville, through Mr. De&#xD;
Courcy, who carried out her wishes when she en-&#xD;
tered the convent.&#xD;
Winnie's life glided peacefully on with her father&#xD;
and mother. Many of the old people have dropped&#xD;

I,&#xD;
&#xD;
to sleep in the hope of a glorious resurrection, but&#xD;
Toney Byrne yet lives, loved and respected by all&#xD;
who know him.&#xD;
Still on winter evenings the neighbors gather&#xD;
around his fireside as in days of yore, and beguile&#xD;
the hours with legend, and song, and tale. Still&#xD;
Toney watches the budding corn and waving fields&#xD;
he tilled for so many years, and his life is a continual&#xD;
prayer of thanksgiving. He thinks of the old neigh-&#xD;
bors who were persecuted to death or forced to emi-&#xD;
grate to foreign lands, while he can sit securely and&#xD;
smoke at his porch, listening to the concert the&#xD;
sweet birds are making; and in the humility of his&#xD;
heart he wonders why it is that God has so espe-&#xD;
cially favored him. The terrible trials he has passed&#xD;
through have faded from his memory ; or, if ever&#xD;
spoken of, he always says .&#xD;
"Well, don't you see how God in his tender mer-&#xD;
cies brought us through all? And now we're better&#xD;
off than ever! Praises be to His holy name !"&#xD;
And now, dear reader, lest in this changeful world&#xD;
some new evil should befall us, I will make my&#xD;
adieu, hoping you will follow the advice I gave you&#xD;
in the first chapter-to visit before you die the lovely&#xD;
