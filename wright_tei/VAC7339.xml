"Such dupes are men to custom, and so prone&#xD;
To reverence what Is ancient, and can plead&#xD;
A course Qf long observance for Its use,&#xD;
That even servitude, the worst of ills,&#xD;
Because delivered down from sire to son,&#xD;
Is kept and guarded as a sacred thing.&#xD;
But is it fit, or can it bear the shock&#xD;
Of rational discussion, that a man&#xD;
Compounded and made up, like other men,&#xD;
Of elements tumultuous, in whom lust&#xD;
And folly In as ample measure meet,&#xD;
As in the bosom of the slave he rules,&#xD;
Should be a despot absolute, and boast&#xD;
Himself the only freeman of his land?"&#xD;

EDITOR'S PREFACE.&#xD;
WHEN the editor commenced the preparation, of the fol.&#xD;
lowing narrative, he did not suppose it would reach the size of&#xD;
this volume. In order, however,,.to present all the facts which&#xD;
have been communicated to him, it has seemed necessary to&#xD;
extend it to its present length.&#xD;
Many of the statements contained in the following pages are&#xD;
corroborated by abundant evidence - others rest entirely upon&#xD;
Solomon's assertion. That he has adhered strictly to the truth,&#xD;
the editor, at least, who has had an opportunity of detecting&#xD;
any contradiction or discrepancy in his statements, is well sat-&#xD;
isfied. He has invariably repeated the same story without&#xD;
deviating in the slightest particular, and has also carefully pe-&#xD;
rused the manuscript, dictating an alteration wherever the most&#xD;
trivial inaccuracy has appeared.&#xD;
It was Solomon's fortune, during his captivity, to be owned by&#xD;
several masters. The treatment he received while at the "Pine&#xD;
Woods " shows that among slaveholders there are men of hu-&#xD;
manity as well as of cruelty. Some of them are spoken of with&#xD;
emotions of gratitude - others in a spirit of bitterness. It is&#xD;

&#xD;
believed that the following account of his experience on Bayou&#xD;
Bocuf presents a correct picture of Slavery, in all its lights and&#xD;
shadows, as it now exists in that locality. Unbiased, as he&#xD;
conceives, by any prepossessions or prejudices, the only object&#xD;
of the editor has been to give a faithful history of Solomon&#xD;
Northup's life, as he received it from his lips.&#xD;
In the accomplishment of that object, he trusts he has suc.&#xD;
ceeded, notwithstanding the numerous faults of style and of&#xD;
expresssion it may be found to contain.&#xD;

hAvING been born a freeman, and for more than&#xD;
thirty years enjoyed the blessings of liberty in a free&#xD;
State-- and having at the end of that time been kid-&#xD;
napped and sold into Slavery, where I remained, until&#xD;
happily rescued in the month of January, 1853, after&#xD;
a bondage of twelve years-it has been suggested&#xD;
that an account of my life and fortunes would not be&#xD;
uninteresting to the public.&#xD;
Since my return to liberty, I have not failed to per-&#xD;
ceive the increasing interest throughout the Korthern&#xD;
States, in regard to the subject of Slavery. Works of&#xD;
fiction, professing to portray its features in their more&#xD;
pleasing as well as more repugnant aspects, have been&#xD;

&#xD;
circulated to an extent unprecedented, and, as I un-&#xD;
derstand, have created a fruitful topic of comment and&#xD;
discussion.&#xD;
I can speak of Slavery only so far as it came under&#xD;
my own observation -only so far as I have known&#xD;
and experienced it in my own person. My object is,&#xD;
to give a candid and truthful statement of facts: to&#xD;
repeat the story of my life, without exaggeration, leav-&#xD;
ing it for others to determine, whether even the pages&#xD;
of fiction present a picture of more cruel wrong or a&#xD;
severer bondage.&#xD;
As far back as I have been able to ascertain, my&#xD;
ancestors on the paternal side were slaves in Rhode&#xD;
Island. They belonged to a family by the name of&#xD;
Northup, one of whom, removing to the State of New-&#xD;
York, settled at Hoosic, in Rensselaer county. He&#xD;
brought with him Mintus Northup, my father. On&#xD;
the death of this gentleman, which must have occur-&#xD;
red some fifty years ago, my father became free, hav-&#xD;
ing been emancipated by a direction in his will.&#xD;
Henry B..Northup, Esq., of Sandy Hill, a distin-&#xD;
guished counselor at law, and the man to whom, un-&#xD;
der Providence, I am indebted for my present liberty,&#xD;
and my return to the society of my wife and children,&#xD;
is a relative of the family in which my forefathers&#xD;
were thus held to service, and from which they took&#xD;
the name I bear. To this fact may be attributed the&#xD;
persevering interest he has taken in my behalf.&#xD;
Sometime after my father's liberation, he removed&#xD;
to the town of Minerva, Essex county, N. Y., where I&#xD;
&#xD;
was born, in the month;of Jnly, 1808.' How long he&#xD;
remained in the latter place I'have not the means of&#xD;
definitely ascertaining. From thence he removed to&#xD;
Granville, Washington county, near a place known as&#xD;
Slyborough, where, for some years, he labored on the&#xD;
farm of Clark Northup, also a relative of his old mas-&#xD;
ter; from thence he removed to the Alden farm, at&#xD;
Moss Street, a short distance north of the village of&#xD;
Sandy Hill; and from thence to the farm now owned&#xD;
by Russel Pratt, situated on the road leading from&#xD;
Fort Edward to Argyle, where he continued to reside&#xD;
until his death, which took place on the 22d day of&#xD;
November, 1829. He left a widow and-two children&#xD;
--myself, and Joseph, an elder brother. The latter&#xD;
is still living in the county of Oswego, near the city&#xD;
of that name ; my mother died during the period of&#xD;
my captivity.&#xD;
Though born a slave, and laboring under the disad-&#xD;
vantages to which my unfortunate race is subjected,&#xD;
my father was a man respected for his industry and&#xD;
integrity, as many now living, who well remember&#xD;
him, are ready to testify. His whole life was passed in&#xD;
the peaceful pursuits of agriculture, never seeking em-&#xD;
ployment in those more menial positions, which seem&#xD;
to be especially allotted to the children of Africa. Be-&#xD;
sides giving us an education surpassing that ordinari-&#xD;
ly bestowed upon children -in our condition, he ac-&#xD;
quired, by his diligence and economy, a sufficient&#xD;
property qualification to entitle him to the right of&#xD;
suffrage. He was accustomed to speak to us of his&#xD;

GOOD RESOLUTIONS.            21&#xD;
&#xD;
early life; and although at all times cherishing the&#xD;
warmest emotions of kindness, and even of affection\&#xD;
towards the family, in whose house he had 1een a .&#xD;
bondsman, he nevertheless comprehended the system&#xD;
of Slavery, and dwelt with sorrow on the degradation&#xD;
of his race. He endeavored to imbue our minds with&#xD;
sentiments of morality, and to teach us to place our&#xD;
trust and confidence in Him who regards the humblest&#xD;
as well as the highest of his creatures. How often&#xD;
since that time has the recollection of his paternal&#xD;
counsels occurred to me, while lying in a slave hut in&#xD;
the distant and sickly regions of Louisiana, smarting&#xD;
with the undeserved wounds which an inhuman mas-&#xD;
ter had inflicted, and longing only for the grave which&#xD;
had covered him, to shield me also from the lash of&#xD;
the oppressor. In the church-yard at Sandy Hill, an&#xD;
humble stone marks the spot where he reposes, after&#xD;
having worthily performed the duties appertaining to.&#xD;
the lowly sphere wherein God had appointed him to&#xD;
walk.&#xD;
Up to this period I had been principally engaged&#xD;
with my father in the labors of the farm. The leis-&#xD;
ure hours allowed me were generally either employed&#xD;
over my books, or playing on the violin- an amuse,&#xD;
ment which was the ruling passion of my youth. -It&#xD;
has also been the source of consolation since, affording&#xD;
pleasure to the simple beings with whom my lot was&#xD;
cast, and beguiling my own thoughts, for many hours,&#xD;
from the painful contemplation of my fate.&#xD;
On Christmas day, 1829, I was married to Anne&#xD;
&#xD;
Hampton, a colored girl then living in the vicinity of&#xD;
our residence. The ceremony was performed at Fort&#xD;
Edward, by Timothy Eddy, Esq., a magistrate of&#xD;
that town, and still a prominent citizen of the place.&#xD;
She had resided a long time at Sandy Hill, with Mr.&#xD;
Baird, proprietor of the Eagle Tavern, and also in'the&#xD;
family of Rev. Alexander Proudfilt, of Salem. This&#xD;
gentleman for many years had presided over the Pres-&#xD;
byterian society at the latter place, and was widely&#xD;
distinguished for his learning and piety. Anne&#xD;
still holds in grateful remembrance the exceeding&#xD;
kindness and the excellent counsels of that good man.&#xD;
She is not able to determine the exact line of her de-&#xD;
scent, but the blood of three races mingles in her&#xD;
veins. It is difficult to tell whether the red, white, or&#xD;
black predominates. The union of them all, however,&#xD;
in her origin, has given her a singular but pleasing&#xD;
expression, such as is rarely to be seen. Though&#xD;
somewhat resembling, yet she cannot properly be&#xD;
styled a quadroon, a class to which, I have omitted to&#xD;
mention, my mother belonged.&#xD;
I had just now passed the period of my minority,&#xD;
having reached the age of twenty-one years in the&#xD;
month of July previous. Deprived of the advice and&#xD;
assistance of my father, with a wife dependent upon&#xD;
me for support, I resolved to enter upon a life of in-&#xD;
dustry ; and notwithstanding the obstacle of color,&#xD;
and the consciousness of my lowly state, indulged inL&#xD;
pleasant dreams of a good time coming, when the pos-&#xD;
session of some humble habitation, with a few sur-.&#xD;

22           TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
rounding acres, should reward my labors, and bring&#xD;
me the means of happiness and comfort.&#xD;
From the time of my marriageto this day the love&#xD;
I have borne 'my wife has been sincere and unabated;&#xD;
and only those who have felt the glowing tenderness&#xD;
a father cherishes for his offspring, can appreciate my&#xD;
affection for the beloved children which have since&#xD;
been born to us.- This much I deem appropriate and&#xD;
necessary to say, in order that those who read these&#xD;
pages, may comprehend the poignancy of those suf-&#xD;
ferings I have been doomed to bear.&#xD;
Immediately upon our marriage we commenced&#xD;
house-keeping, in the old yellow building then stand-&#xD;
ing at the southern extremity of Fort Edward village,&#xD;
and which has since been transformed into a modern&#xD;
mansion, and lately occupied by Captain Lathrop.&#xD;
It is, known as the Fort House. In this building the&#xD;
courts were sometime held after the organization of&#xD;
the county. It was also occupied by Burgoyne in&#xD;
1777, being situated near the old Fort on the left bank&#xD;
of the Hudson.&#xD;
During the winter I was employed with others re-&#xD;
pairing the Champlain Canal, on that section over&#xD;
which William Van Nortwick was superintendent.&#xD;
David McEachron had the immediate charge of the&#xD;
men in whose company I labored. By the time the&#xD;
canal opened in the spring, I was enabled, from the'&#xD;
savings of my wages, to purchase a pair of horses, and&#xD;
other things necessarily required in the business of&#xD;
navigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
Having hired several efficient hands to assist me, I&#xD;
entered into contracts for the transportation of large&#xD;
rafts of timber from Lake Champlain to-Troy. Dyer&#xD;
Beckwith and a Mr. Bartemy, of Whitehall, accompa-&#xD;
nied me on several trips. During the season I be-&#xD;
came perfectly familiar with the art and mysteries of&#xD;
rafting*-a knowledge which afterwards enabled me&#xD;
to render profitable service to a worthy master, and&#xD;
to astonish the simple-witted lumbermen on the banks&#xD;
of the Bayou Beuf.&#xD;
In one of my voyages down Lake Champlain, I was&#xD;
induced to make a visit to Canada. Repairing to&#xD;
Montreal, I visited the cathedral and other places of&#xD;
interest in that city, from whence I continued my ex-&#xD;
cursion to Kingston and other towns, obtaining a&#xD;
knowledge of localities, which was also of ,service to&#xD;
me afterwards, as will appear towards the close of&#xD;
this narrative.&#xD;
Having completed my contracts on the canal satis-&#xD;
factorily to myself and to my employer, and not wish-&#xD;
ing to remain idle, now that the, navigation of the ca-&#xD;
nal was again suspended, I entered into another con-&#xD;
tract with Medad Gunn, to cut a large quantity of&#xD;
wood. In this business I was engaged during the&#xD;
winter of 1831-32.&#xD;
With the return of spring, Anne and myself con-&#xD;
ceived the project of taking a farm in the neighbor-&#xD;
hood. I had been accustomed from earliest youth to&#xD;
agricultural labors, and-it was an occupation conge-&#xD;
nial to my tastes.' I accordingly entered into arrange-&#xD;

TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
r&#xD;
&#xD;
ments for a part of the old Alden farm, on which my&#xD;
father formerly resided. With one cow, one swine,&#xD;
a yoke of fine oxen I had lately purchased of Lewis&#xD;
Browning Hartford, and other personal property and&#xD;
effects, we proceeded to our new home in Kingsbury.&#xD;
That year I planted twenty-five acres of corn, sowed&#xD;
large fields of oats, and commenced farming upon as&#xD;
large a scale as my utmost means would permit.&#xD;
Anne was diligent about the house affairs, while I&#xD;
toiled laboriously in the field.&#xD;
On this place we continued to reside until 1834.&#xD;
In the winter season I had numerous calls to play on&#xD;
the violin. Wherever the young people assembled to&#xD;
dance, I was almost invariably there. Throughout&#xD;
the surrounding villages my fiddle was notorious.&#xD;
Anne, also, during her long residence at the Eagle&#xD;
Tavern, had become somewhat famous as a cook.&#xD;
During court weeks, and on public occasions, she was&#xD;
employed at high wages in the kitchen at Sherrill's&#xD;
Coffee House.&#xD;
We always returned home from the performance&#xD;
of these services with money in our pockets; so that,&#xD;
with fiddling,.cooking, and farming, we soon found&#xD;
ourselves in the possession of abundance, and, in fact,&#xD;
leading a happy and prosperous life. Well, indeed,&#xD;
would it have been for us had we remained on the&#xD;
farm at Kingsbury; but the time came when the&#xD;
next step' was to be taken towards the cruel destiny&#xD;
that awaited me.&#xD;
In March, 1834, we removed to Saratoga Springs.&#xD;
&#xD;
We occupied a house belonging to Daniel O'Brien,&#xD;
on the north side of Washington street. At that time&#xD;
Isaac Taylor kept a large boarding house, known as&#xD;
Washington Hall, at the north end of Broadway.: He&#xD;
employed me to drive a hack, in which capacity 1&#xD;
worked for him two years. After this time I was&#xD;
generally employed through the visiting season, as&#xD;
also was Anne, in the United States Hotel, and other&#xD;
public houses of the place. In winter seasons I re-&#xD;
lied upon my violin, though during the construction&#xD;
of the Troy and Saratoga railroad, I performed many&#xD;
hard days' labor upon it.&#xD;
I was in the habit, at Saratoga, of purchasing arti&#xD;
cles necessary for my family at the stores of Mr. Ce&#xD;
phas Parker and Mr. William Perry, gentlemen&#xD;
towards whom, for many acts of kindness, I enter-&#xD;
tamed feelings of strong regard. It was for this rea-&#xD;
son that, twelve years afterwards, I caused to be di-&#xD;
rected-to them the letter, which is hereinafter insert-&#xD;
ed-, and which was the means, in the hands of Mr.&#xD;
Northup, of my fortunate deliverance.&#xD;
While living at the United States Hotel, I frequent-&#xD;
ly met with slaves, who had accompanied their mas-&#xD;
ters from the South. They were always well dressed&#xD;
and well provided for, leading apparently an easy life,&#xD;
with but few of its ordinary troubles to perplex them.&#xD;
Many times they entered into conversation with me&#xD;
on the subject of Slavery. Almost uniformly I found&#xD;
they cherished a secret desire for liberty. Some of&#xD;
them expressed the most ardent anxiety to escape, and&#xD;

consulted me on the best method of effecting it. The&#xD;
fear of punishment, however, which they knew was&#xD;
certain to attend their re-capture and return, in all&#xD;
cases proved sufficient to deter them from the exper-&#xD;
iment. Having all my life breathed the free air of&#xD;
the North, and conscious that I possessed the same&#xD;
feelings and affections that find a place in the white&#xD;
man's breast; conscious, moreover, of an intelligence&#xD;
equal to that of some men, at least, with a fairer skin,&#xD;
I was too ignorant, perhaps too independent, to con-&#xD;
ceive how any one could be content to live in the ab-&#xD;
ject condition of a. slave. I could not comrehend the&#xD;
justice of that law, or that religion, which upholds or&#xD;
recognizes the principle of Slavery; and never once,&#xD;
I am proud to say., did I fail to counsel any one who&#xD;
came to me, to watch his opportunity, and strike for&#xD;
freedom.&#xD;
I continued to reside at Saratoga until the spring of&#xD;
1841. The flattering anticipations which, seven years&#xD;
before, had seduced us from the quiet farm-house, on&#xD;
the east side of the Hudson, had not been realized.&#xD;
Though always in comfortable circumstances, we&#xD;
had not prospered. The society and associations ai that&#xD;
world-renowned watering place, were not calculated&#xD;
to preserve the simple habits of industry and economy&#xD;
to which I had been accustomed, but, on the contrary,&#xD;
to substitute others in their stead, tending to shift-&#xD;
lessness and extravagance.&#xD;
At this time we were the parents of three children&#xD;
---Elizabeth, Margaret, and Alonzo. Elizabeth, the&#xD;
&#xD;
HOME .AND ITS PLEASURES.&#xD;
&#xD;
eldest, was in her .tenth year; Margaret was two&#xD;
years younger, and little Alonzo had just passed his&#xD;
fifth birth-day. They filled our house with gladness.&#xD;
Their young voices were music in our ears. Many an&#xD;
airy castle did their mother and myself build for. the&#xD;
little innocents. When not at labor I was always&#xD;
walking with them, clad in their best attire, through&#xD;
the streets and groves of Saratoga. Their presence&#xD;
was my delight ; and I clasped them to my bosom&#xD;
with as warm and tender love as if their clouded skins&#xD;
had been as white as snow.&#xD;
Thus far the history 6f my life presents nothing&#xD;
whatever unusual-nothing but the common hopes,&#xD;
and loves, and labors of an obscure colored man, ma-&#xD;
king his humble progress in the world. But now I&#xD;
had reached a turning point in my existence - reach-&#xD;
ed the threshold of unutterable wrong, and sorrow,&#xD;
and despair. Now had I approached within the shad-&#xD;
ow of the cloud, into the thick darkness whereof I was&#xD;
soon to disappear, thenceforward to be hidden from&#xD;
the eyes of all my kindred, and shut out from the&#xD;
sweet light of liberty, for many a weary year.&#xD;

SENSIBILITY-CHAINS AND DARKNESS.&#xD;
ONE morning, towards the latter part of the month&#xD;
of March, 1841, having at that time no particular&#xD;
business to engage my attention, I was walking about&#xD;
the village of Saratoga Springs, thinking to myself&#xD;
where I might obtain some present employment, un-&#xD;
til the busy season should arrive. Anne, as was her&#xD;
usual custom, had gone over to Sandy Hill, a dis-&#xD;
tance of some twenty miles, to take charge of the cu-&#xD;
linary department at Sherrill's Coffee House, during&#xD;
the session of the court. Elizabeth, I think, had ac-&#xD;
companied her. Margaret and Alonzo were with&#xD;
their aunt at Saratoga.&#xD;
Onthe corner of Congress street and Broadway,&#xD;
near the tavern, then, and for aught I know to the&#xD;
contrary, still kept by Mr. Moon, I was met by two&#xD;
gentlemen of respectable appearance, both of whom&#xD;
were entirely unknown to me. I have the impres-&#xD;
&#xD;
sion that they were introduced to me by some one of&#xD;
my acquaintances, but who, I have in vain endeavor-&#xD;
ed to recall, with the remark that I was an expert&#xD;
player on the violin.&#xD;
At any rate, they immediately entered into conver-&#xD;
sation on that subject, making numerous inquiries&#xD;
touching my proficiency in that respect. My respon-&#xD;
ses being to all appearances satisfactory, they propos-&#xD;
ed to engage my services for a short period, stating,&#xD;
at the same time, I was just such a person as their&#xD;
business required. Their names, as they afterwards&#xD;
gave them to .me, were Merrill Brown and Abram&#xD;
Hamilton, though whether these were their true ap-&#xD;
pellations, I have :strong reasons to doubt. The for-&#xD;
mer was a man apparently forty years of age, some-&#xD;
what short and thick-set, with a countenance indica-&#xD;
ting shrewdness and intelligence. He wore a black&#xD;
frock boat and black hat, and said he resided either at&#xD;
Rochester or at Syracuse. The latter was a young&#xD;
man of fair complexion and light eyes, and, I should&#xD;
judge, had not passed the age of twenty-five. He&#xD;
was tall and slender, dressed in a snuff-colored coat,&#xD;
with glossy hat, and vest of elegant pattern. His&#xD;
whole apparel was in the extreme of fashion. His&#xD;
appearance was somewhat effeminate, but prepossess-&#xD;
ing, and there was about him an easy air, that showed&#xD;
he had mingled with the world. They were connect-&#xD;
ed, as they informed me, with a circus company, then&#xD;
j     in the city of Washington; that they, were on their&#xD;

way thither to rejoin it, having left it for a short time&#xD;
to make an excursion northward, for the purpose of&#xD;
seeing the country, and were paying their expenses&#xD;
by an occasional exhibition. They also remarked&#xD;
that they had found much difficulty in procuring mu-&#xD;
sic for their entertainments, and that if I would ac-&#xD;
company them as far as New-York, they would give&#xD;
me one dollar for each day's services, and three dol-&#xD;
lars in addition for every night I played at their per-&#xD;
formances, besides sufficient to pay the expenses of&#xD;
my return from New-York to Saratoga.&#xD;
I at once accepted the tempting offer, both for the&#xD;
reward it promised, and from a desire to visit the&#xD;
metropolis. They were anxious to leave immediately.&#xD;
Thinking my absence would be brief, I did not deem&#xD;
it necessary to write to Anne whither I had gone;&#xD;
in fact supposing that my return, perhaps, would be&#xD;
as soon as hers. So taking a change of linen and my&#xD;
violin, I was ready to depart.. The carriage was&#xD;
brought round--a covered one, drawn by a pair of&#xD;
noble bays, altogether forming an elegant establish-&#xD;
ment. Their baggage, consisting of three large&#xD;
trunks, was fastened on the rack, and mounting to&#xD;
the driver's seat, while they took their places in the&#xD;
rear, I drove away from Saratoga on the road to&#xD;
Albany, elated with my new position, and happy as&#xD;
I had ever been, on any day in all my life.&#xD;
We passed through Ballston, and striking the ridge&#xD;
road, as it is called, if my memory correctly serves&#xD;
&#xD;
me, followed it direct to Albany. We reached that&#xD;
city before dark, and stopped at a hotel southward&#xD;
from the Museum.&#xD;
This night I had an opportunity of witnessing one&#xD;
of their performances -the only one, during the whole&#xD;
period I was with tk p1. Hamilton was stationed at&#xD;
the door'; I formed We orchestra, while Brown pro-&#xD;
vided the entertainment. It consisted in throwing&#xD;
balls, dancing on the rope, frying pancakes in a hat,&#xD;
causing invisible pigs to squeal, and other like feats&#xD;
of ventriloquism and legerdemain. The audience&#xD;
was extraordinarily sparse, and not of the selectest&#xD;
character at that, and Hamilton's report of the pro-&#xD;
ceeds presented but a " beggarly account of empty&#xD;
boxes."&#xD;
Early next morning we renewed our journey. The&#xD;
burden of their conversation now was the expression&#xD;
of an anxiety to reach the circus without delay.&#xD;
They hurried forward, without again stopping to ex-&#xD;
bibit, and in due course of time, we reached New-&#xD;
York, taking lodgings at a house on the west side of&#xD;
the city, in a street running from Broadway to the&#xD;
river. I supposed my journey was at an end, and&#xD;
expected in a day or two at least, to return to my&#xD;
friends and family at Saratoga. Brown and Hamil-&#xD;
ton, however, began to importune me to continue with&#xD;
them to Washington. They alleged that immediately&#xD;
on their arrival, now that the summer season was ap-&#xD;
proaching, the circus' would set out for the north.&#xD;
They promised me a situation and high wages if I&#xD;

would accompany them. Largely did they expatiate&#xD;
on the advantages that would result to me, and such&#xD;
were the flattering representations they made, that I&#xD;
finally concluded to accept the offer.&#xD;
The next morning they suggested that, inasmuch&#xD;
as we were about entering a sla e State, it would be&#xD;
well, before leaving New-YorIk, to procure free pa-&#xD;
pers. The.idea struck me as a prudent one, though I&#xD;
think it would scarcely have occurred to me, had they&#xD;
not proposed it. We proceeded at onc to what Iun-&#xD;
derstood to be the Custom House. They  ade oath to&#xD;
certain facts showing I was a free mang A paper was&#xD;
drawn up and handed us, with thed$ftion to take it&#xD;
to the clerk's office. We did so, andthe clerk having&#xD;
added something to it, for which he was paid six shil-&#xD;
lings, we returned again to the Custom House. Some&#xD;
further formalities were gone through with before it&#xD;
was completed, when, paying the officer two dollars,&#xD;
I placed the papers in my pocket, and started with&#xD;
my two friends to our hotel. I thought at the time,&#xD;
Imust confess, that the papers were scarcely worth the&#xD;
cost of obtaining them-the apprehension of danger&#xD;
to my personal safety never having suggested itself&#xD;
to me in the remotest manner. The clerk, to whom&#xD;
we were directed, I remember, made a memorandum&#xD;
in a large book, which, I presume, is in the office&#xD;
yet. A reference to the-entries during the y; part,&#xD;
of March, or first of April, 1841, I have  oubt&#xD;
will satisfy the incredulous, at least so far  par-&#xD;
ticular transaction is concerned.&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
&#xD;
With the evidence of freedom in my possession, the&#xD;
next day after our arrival in New-York, we crossed&#xD;
the ferry to Jersey City, and took the road to Phila-&#xD;
delphia. Here we remained one night, continuing&#xD;
our journey towards Baltimore early in the morning.&#xD;
In due time, we arrived in the latter city, and stopped&#xD;
at a hotel near the railroad depot, either kept by a&#xD;
Mr. Rathbone, or known as the Rathbone House.&#xD;
All the way from New-York, their anxiety to reach&#xD;
the circus seemed to grow more and more intense.&#xD;
We left the ca 'age at Baltimore, and entering the&#xD;
cars, proce  ~   Washington, at which place we&#xD;
arrived just;11fall, the evening previous to the&#xD;
funeral of Ge   Harrison, and stopped at Gadsby's&#xD;
Hotel, on Pennsylvania Avenue.&#xD;
.After supper they called me to their apartments,&#xD;
and paid me forty-three dollars, a sum greater than&#xD;
my wages amounted to, which act of generosity was&#xD;
in consequence, they said, of their not having exhib-&#xD;
ited as often as they had given me to anticipate, du-&#xD;
ring our trip from Saratoga. They moreover inform-&#xD;
ed me that it had been the intention of the circus&#xD;
company to leave Washington the next morning, but&#xD;
that on account of the funeral, they had concluded to&#xD;
remain another day. They were then, as they had been&#xD;
from',     e of our first meeting, extremely kind.&#xD;
N          ity was omitted of addressing me in the&#xD;

&#xD;
gave them my confidence without reserve, and would&#xD;
freely have trusted them to almost any extent. Their&#xD;
constant conversation and manner towards me-their&#xD;
foresight in suggesting the idea of free papers, and a&#xD;
hundred other little acts, unnecessary to be repeated&#xD;
all indicated that they were friends indeed, sincerely&#xD;
solicitous for my welfare. I know not but they were.&#xD;
I know not but they were innocent of the great wick-&#xD;
edness of which I now believe them guilty. Whether,&#xD;
they were accessory to my misfortunes-subtle and.&#xD;
inhuman monsters in the shape of -designedly&#xD;
luring me away from home and        nd liberty,&#xD;
for the sake of gold-those           ese pages&#xD;
will have the same means of det    g as myself.&#xD;
If they were innocent, my sudden disappearance&#xD;
must have been unaccountable indeed; but revolv-&#xD;
ing in my mind all the attending circumstances, I&#xD;
never yet could indulge, towards them, so charitable&#xD;
a supposition.&#xD;
After receiving the money from them, of which&#xD;
they appeared to have an abundance, they advised&#xD;
me not to -go into the streets that night, inasmuch&#xD;
as I was unacquainted with the customs of the city.&#xD;
Promising to remember their advice, I left them to-&#xD;
gether, and soon after was shown by a colored ser-&#xD;
vant to a sleeping room in the back part  hotel,&#xD;
on the ground floor. I laid down to rest   of&#xD;
home and wife, and children, and the 1      ce&#xD;
that stretched between us, until I fell as  But&#xD;
&#xD;
no good angel of pity came to my bedside, bidding&#xD;
me to fly-no voice of mercy forewarned me in my&#xD;
dreams of the trials that were just at hand.&#xD;
The next day there was a great pageant in Wash-&#xD;
ington. The roar of cannon and the tolling of bells&#xD;
filled the air, while many houses were shrouded with&#xD;
crape, and the streets were black with people. As&#xD;
the day advanced, the procession made its appear-&#xD;
ance, coming slowly through the Avenue, carriage&#xD;
after carriage, in long succession, while thousands&#xD;
upon thousands followed on foot-all moving to the&#xD;
sound of meik c~holy music. They were bearing the&#xD;
dead body of    rison to the grave.&#xD;
From early Inthe morning, I was constantly in the&#xD;
company of Hamilton and Brown. They were the&#xD;
only persons I knew in Washington. We stood to-&#xD;
gether as the funeral pomp passed .by. I remember&#xD;
distinctly how the window glass would break and&#xD;
rattle to the ground, after each report of the cannon&#xD;
.they were firing in the burial ground.. We went to the&#xD;
Capitol, and walked a long time about the grounds.&#xD;
.In the afternoon, they strolled towards the Presi-&#xD;
dent's House, all the time keeping me near to them,&#xD;
and pointing out various places of interest. As yet,&#xD;
I had seen nothing of the circus. In fact, I had&#xD;
thought of it but little, if at all, amidst the excite-&#xD;
. me       e day.&#xD;
ds, several times during the afternoon, en-&#xD;
tered drinking saloons, and called for liquor. They&#xD;
were by no means in the habit, however, so far as I&#xD;

&#xD;
knew them, of indulging to excess. On these occa-.&#xD;
sions, after serving themselves, they would pour out&#xD;
a glass and hand it to me. I did not become intoxi-&#xD;
cated, as may be inferred from what subsequently,&#xD;
occurred. Towards evening, and soon after parta-&#xD;
king of one of these potations, I began to experience&#xD;
most unpleasant sensations. I felt extremely ill. My&#xD;
head commenced aching -a dull, heavy pain, inex-&#xD;
pressibly disagreeable. At the supper table, I was&#xD;
without appetite ; the sight and flavor of food was'&#xD;
nauseous. About dark the same servant conducted&#xD;
me to the room I had occupied the previous night.&#xD;
Brown and Hamilton advised me to retire, commise-&#xD;
rating me kindly, and expressing hopes that I would be&#xD;
better in the morning. Divesting myself of coat and&#xD;
boots merely, I threw myself upon the bed. It was&#xD;
impossible to sleep. The pain in my head continued&#xD;
to increase, until it became almost unbearable.' In a&#xD;
short time I became thirsty. My lips were parched.&#xD;
I could think of nothing but water -of lakes and&#xD;
sowing rivers, of brooks where I had stooped to&#xD;
Brink, and of the dripping bucket, rising with its cool&#xD;
and overflowing nectar, from the bottom of the well.&#xD;
Towards midnight, as near as I could judge, I arose,&#xD;
unable longer to bear such intensity of thirst. I&#xD;
was a stranger in the house, and knew nothing of its&#xD;
apartments. There was no one up, as I could  -ve.&#xD;
Groping about at random, I knew not wherg und&#xD;
,the way at last to a kitchen in the basement. Two&#xD;
or three colored servants were moving through it, one&#xD;
&#xD;
of whom, a wqman, gave me two glasses of water.&#xD;
It afforded momentary relief, but by the time I had&#xD;
reached my room again, the sane burning desire of&#xD;
drink, the same tormenting thirst, had again returned.&#xD;
It was even more torturing than before, as was also&#xD;
the wild pain in my head, if sueh a thing could be.&#xD;
I was in sore distress -in most excruciating agony!&#xD;
I seemed to stand on the brink of madness ! The&#xD;
memory of that night of horrible suffering will fol&#xD;
low meto the grave.&#xD;
In the course of an hour or more after my return&#xD;
from the kitchen, I was conscious of some one enter-&#xD;
ing my room. There seemed to be several -a ming-&#xD;
ling of various voices,-but how many, or who&#xD;
they were, I cannot tell. Whether Brown and Hamil-&#xD;
ton were among them, is a mere matter of conjecture.&#xD;
I only remember, with any degree of distinctness,&#xD;
that I was told it was necessary to go to' a physician&#xD;
and procure medicine, and that pulling on my boots,&#xD;
-without coat or hat, I followed them through a long&#xD;
passage-way, or alley, into the open street. It ran&#xD;
out at right angles from Pennsylvania Avenue. On&#xD;
the opposite side there was a light burning in a win-&#xD;
dow. My impression is there were then three per-&#xD;
sons with me, but it is altogether indefinite and&#xD;
vague, and like the memory of a painful dream:&#xD;
Going, towards the light; which I imagined proceed-&#xD;
ed from a physician's office, anad which seemed to re-&#xD;
cede as I advanced, is the 1ast glimmering recollec-&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAINS AND DARKNESS.        39&#xD;
&#xD;
insensible. How long I remained in that condition -&#xD;
whether only that night, or many days and nights-&#xD;
I do not know; but when consciousness returned, I&#xD;
found myself alone, in utter darkness, and in chains.&#xD;
The-pain in my head had subsided in a measure,&#xD;
but I was very faint and weak. I was sitting upon a&#xD;
low bench, made of rough boards, and without coat&#xD;
or hat. I was hand-cuffed. Around my ankles also&#xD;
were a pair of heavy fetters. One end of a chain was&#xD;
fastened to a large ring in the floor, the other to the&#xD;
fetters on my ankles. I tried in vain to stand upon&#xD;
my feet. Waking from such a painful trance, it&#xD;
was some time before I could collect my thoughts.&#xD;
Where was I? What was the meaning of these&#xD;
chains? Where were Brown and Hamilton? What&#xD;
had I done to deserve imprisonment in such a dun-&#xD;
geon ? I could not comprehend. There was a blank&#xD;
of some indefinite period, preceding. my awakening&#xD;
in that lonely place, the events of which the utmost&#xD;
stretch of memory was unable to recall. I listened&#xD;
intently for some sign or sound of life, but nothing&#xD;
broke the oppressive silence, save the clinking of my&#xD;
chains, whenever I chanced to move. I spoke aloud,&#xD;
but the sound of my voice startled me. I felt of my&#xD;
pockets, so far as the fetters would allow - far enough,&#xD;
indeed, to ascertain that I had not only been robbed&#xD;
of liberty, but that my money and free papers were&#xD;
also gone! Then did the idea begin to break upon&#xD;
my mind, at first dim and confused, that I had been&#xD;
kidnapped. But that I thought was incredible.&#xD;
&#xD;
There must have been some misapprehension-some&#xD;
unfortunate mistake. It could not be that a free&#xD;
citizen of New-York, who had wronged no man, nor&#xD;
violated any law, should be dealt with thus inhumanly.&#xD;
The more I contemplated my situation, however, the&#xD;
more I became confirmed in my suspicions. It was a&#xD;
desolate thought, indeed. I felt there was no trust or&#xD;
mercy in unfeeling man ; and commending myself to&#xD;
the God of the oppressed, bowed my head upon my&#xD;
fettered hands, and wept most bitterly.&#xD;

ARRIVAL OF LITTLE EMILY AND HER MOTHER IN'THE PEN-MATERNAL&#xD;
SORROWS-THE STORY OF ELIZA.&#xD;
Son three hours elapsed, during which time I re-&#xD;
mained seated on the low bench, absorbed in painful&#xD;
meditations.   At length I heard the crowing of a&#xD;
cock, and soon a distant rumbling sound, as of car-&#xD;
riages hurrying through the streets, came to my ears,.&#xD;
and I knew that it was day. No ray of light, how-&#xD;
ever, penetrated my prison. Finally, I heard foot-&#xD;
steps immediately overhead, as of some one walking&#xD;
to and fro. It occurred to me then that I must be&#xD;
in an underground apartment, and the damp, mouldy&#xD;
odors of the place confirmed the supposition. The&#xD;
noise above continued for at least an hour, when,&#xD;
at last, I heard footsteps approaching from without.&#xD;
A key rattled in the lock-a strong door swung back&#xD;
upon its hinges, admitting a flood of light, and two&#xD;
men entered and stood before me. One of them was&#xD;
a large, powerful man, forty years of age, perhaps,&#xD;
&#xD;
with dark, chestnut-colored hair, slightly interspersed&#xD;
with gray. His face was full, his complexion flush,&#xD;
his features grossly coarse, expressive of nothing but&#xD;
cruelty and cunning. He was about five feet ten&#xD;
inches high, of full habit, and, without prejudice, I&#xD;
must be allowed to say, was a man whose whole ap&#xD;
pearance was sinister and repiugnant. His name was&#xD;
James H. Burch, as I learned afterwards -a well-&#xD;
known slave-dealer in Washington; and then, or late-&#xD;
ly,. connected in business, as a partner, with Theophi-&#xD;
lus Freeman, of New-Orleans. The person who&#xD;
accompanied him was a simple lackey, named Ebe-&#xD;
nezer Radburn, who acted merely in the capacity of&#xD;
turnkey. Both of'these men still live in Washington,&#xD;
or did, at the time of my return through that city&#xD;
from slavery in January last.&#xD;
The light admitted through the open door enabled&#xD;
me to observe the room in which I was confined. It&#xD;
was about twelve feet square -the walls of solid ma-&#xD;
sonry. The floor was of heavy plank. There was&#xD;
one small window, crossed with great iron bars, with&#xD;
an outside shutter, securely fastened.&#xD;
An iron-bound door led into an adjoining cell, or&#xD;
vault, wholly destitute of windows, or any means of&#xD;
admitting light. The furniture of the room in which&#xD;
I was, consisted of the wooden bench on which I sat,&#xD;
an old-fashioned, dirty box stove, and besides these,&#xD;
in either cell, there was neither bed, nor blanket, nor&#xD;
4      any other thing whatever. The door, through which&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7339-00000022"/>&#xD;
42           TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Burch and Radburn entered, led through a small&#xD;
passage, up a flight of steps into a yard, surrounded&#xD;
by a brick wall ten or twelve feet high, immediately&#xD;
in' rear .of a building of the same width as itself.&#xD;
The yard extended rearward from the house- about&#xD;
thirty feet. In one part of ,the wall there was a&#xD;
strongly ironed door, opening into a narrow, covered&#xD;
passage, leading along one side of the house into the&#xD;
street. The doom of the colored man, upon whom&#xD;
the door leading out of that narrow passage closed,&#xD;
was sealed. The top of the wall supported one end&#xD;
of a roof, which ascended inwards, forming a kind of&#xD;
open shed. Underneath the roof there was a crazy&#xD;
loft all round, where slaves, if so disposed, might&#xD;
sleep at night, or in inclement weather seek shelter&#xD;
from the storm. It was like a farmer's barnyard in&#xD;
most respects, save it was so constructed that the out-&#xD;
side world could never see the human cattle that were&#xD;
herded there.&#xD;
The building to which the yard was attached, was&#xD;
two stories high, fronting on one of the public streets&#xD;
of Washington. Its outside presented only the ap-&#xD;
pearance of a qaiet primete residence. A stranger&#xD;
looking at it,'would never have dreamed of its exe-&#xD;
crable uses. Strange as it may seem, within plain,&#xD;
sight of this same house, looking down from its com-&#xD;
manding height upon it, was the Capitol. The voices&#xD;
of patriotic representatives boasting of freedom and&#xD;
equality, and the rattling of the poor slave's chains,&#xD;
&#xD;
almost commingled. A slave pen within the very&#xD;
shadow of the Capitol!&#xD;
Such is a correct description as it was in 1841, of&#xD;
Williams' slave pen in Washington, in one of the eel&#xD;
lars of which I found myself so unaccountably con-&#xD;
fined.&#xD;
"Well, my boy, how do you feel now $" said&#xD;
Burch, as he entered through the open door. I re-&#xD;
plied that I was sick, and inquired the cause of my&#xD;
imprisonment. He answered that I was his slave -&#xD;
that he had bought me, and that he was about to send&#xD;
me to New-Orleans. I asserted, aloud and boldly,&#xD;
that I was a free, man -a resident of Saratoga, where&#xD;
I had a wife and children, who were also free, and&#xD;
that my name was Northup. I complained bitterly&#xD;
of the strange treatment I had received, and threat-&#xD;
ened, upon my liberation, to have satisfaction for the&#xD;
wrong. He denied that I was free, and with an em-&#xD;
phatic oath, declared that I came from Georgia.&#xD;
Again and again I asserted I was no man's slave, and&#xD;
insisted upon his taking off my chains at once. He&#xD;
endeavored to hush me, as if he feared my voice&#xD;
would be overheard. But I would not be silent, and&#xD;
denounced the authors of my imprisonment, whoever&#xD;
they might be, as unmitigated villains. Finding he&#xD;
could not quiet me, he flew into a towering passion.&#xD;
With blasphemousoaths, he called me a black liar, a&#xD;
ranaway from Georgia, and every othei profane and&#xD;

&#xD;
vulgar epithet that the most indecent fancy could&#xD;
conceive.&#xD;
During this time Radburn was standing silently&#xD;
by. His business was, to oversee this human, or&#xD;
rather inhuman stable, receiving slaves, feeding and&#xD;
whipping them, at the rate of two shillings a head&#xD;
per day. Turning to him, Burch ordered the paddle&#xD;
and cat-o'-ninetails to be brought in. He disappear-&#xD;
ed, and in a few moments returned with these in-&#xD;
struments of torture. The'paddle, as it is termed in&#xD;
slave-beating parlance, or at least the one with which I&#xD;
first became acquainted, and of which I now speak, was&#xD;
a piece of hard-wood board, eighteen or twenty inches&#xD;
long, moulded to the shape of an old-fashioned pudding&#xD;
stick, or ordinary oar. The flattened portion, which&#xD;
was about the size in circumference of two open&#xD;
hands, was bored with a small auger in numerous&#xD;
places. The cat was a large rope of many strands-&#xD;
the strands unraveled, and a knot tied at the extrem-&#xD;
ity of each.&#xD;
As soon as these formidable whips appeared, I was&#xD;
seized by both of them, and roughly.divested of my&#xD;
clothing. My feet, as has been stated, were fastened&#xD;
to the floor. Drawing me over the bench, face down-&#xD;
wards, Radburn placed his heavy foot upon the fet-&#xD;
ters, between my wrists, holding them painfully to the&#xD;
floor. With the paddle, Burch commenced beating&#xD;
me. Blow after blow was inflicted upon my naked&#xD;
body. When his unrelenting arm grew tired, he&#xD;

stopped and asked if I still insisted I was a free man.&#xD;
I did insist upon it, and then the blows were renewed,&#xD;
faster and more energetically, if possible, than before.&#xD;
When again tired, he would repeat the same question,&#xD;
and receiving the same answer, continue his cruel&#xD;
labor. All this time, the incarnate devil was utter-&#xD;
ing most fiendish oaths. At length the paddle broke,&#xD;
leaving the useless handle in his hand. Still I would&#xD;
not yield. All his brutal blows could not force from&#xD;
my lips the foul lie that I was a slave. Casting mad-&#xD;
ly on the floor the handle of the broken paddle, he&#xD;
seized the, rope.. This was far more painful than the&#xD;
other. . I struggled with all my power, but it was in&#xD;
vain. I prayed for mercy, but my prayer was only&#xD;
answered with imprecations and with stripes. I&#xD;
thought I must 'die beneath the lashes of the accursed&#xD;
brute. Even now the flesh crawls upon my bones, as&#xD;
I recall the scene. I was all on fir. My sufferings&#xD;
I can compare to nothing else than the bunting ago-&#xD;
riies of hell !&#xD;
At last I became silent to hisrepeated questions.&#xD;
I would make no reply. In fact, I was. becoming al-&#xD;
most unable to speak. Still,he plied the lash without&#xD;
stint upon my poor body, until it seemed that the&#xD;
lacerated flesh was stripped from.,my bones at every&#xD;
stroke. A man with a particle of mercy in his soul&#xD;
would not have beaten even a dog so cruelly. At&#xD;
length Radburn said that it was useless to whip&#xD;
me any more -that I would be sore enough. There-&#xD;
upon, Burch desisted, saying, with an admonitory'&#xD;

shake of his fist in my face, and hissing the woids&#xD;
through his firm-set teeth, that if ever I dared to&#xD;
utter again that I was entitled to my freedom, that I&#xD;
had been kidnapped, or any thing whatever of the&#xD;
kind, the castigation I had just received was nothing&#xD;
in comparison with what would follow. He swore&#xD;
that he would either conquer or kill me. With these,&#xD;
consolatory words, the fetters were taken from my&#xD;
wrists, my feet still remaining fastened to the ring;&#xD;
the shutter of the little barred window, which had&#xD;
been opened, was again closed, and going out, lock-&#xD;
ing the great door behind them, I was left in dark-&#xD;
ness as before.&#xD;
In an hour, perhaps two, my heart leaped to my&#xD;
throat, as the key rattled in the door again. I, who&#xD;
had been so lonely, and who had longed so ar-&#xD;
dently to see some one, I cared not who, now shud-&#xD;
dered at the thought of man's approach. A human&#xD;
face was fearful to me, especially a white one. Rad-&#xD;
burn entered, bringing" with him, on a tin plate, a&#xD;
piece of shriveled fried pork, a slice of bread and a&#xD;
cup of water. He asked me how I felt, and remark-&#xD;
ed that I had received a pretty severe flogging. He&#xD;
remonstrated with me against .the propriety of as-&#xD;
serting my freedom. In rather a patronizing and&#xD;
confidential manner, he gave it to me as his advice,&#xD;
that the less I said on that subject the better it would&#xD;
be for me. The man evidently endeavored to appear&#xD;
kind-whether touched at the sight of my sad condi-&#xD;
tion, or with the view of silencing, on my part, any&#xD;

further expression of my rights, it is not necessary&#xD;
now to conjecture. He unlocked the fetters from my&#xD;
ankles, opened the shutters of the little window, and&#xD;
departed, leaving me again alone.&#xD;
By this time I had become stiff and sore ; my&#xD;
body was covered with blisters, and it was with great&#xD;
pain and difficulty that I could move. From the&#xD;
window I could observe nothing but the roof resting&#xD;
on the adjacent wall. At night I laid down upon the&#xD;
damp, hard floor, without any pillow or covering&#xD;
whatever. Punctually, twice a day, Radburn came&#xD;
in, with his pork, and bread, and water. I had but&#xD;
little appetite, though I was tormented with contin-&#xD;
ual thirst. 'My wounds would not permit me to re-&#xD;
main but a few minutes in any one position; so, sit-&#xD;
ting, or standing, or moving slowly round, I passed&#xD;
the days and nights. I was heart sick and discour-&#xD;
aged. Thoughts of my family, of my wife and chil-&#xD;
dren, continually occupied my mind. When sleep&#xD;
overpowered me I dreamed of them - dreamed I was&#xD;
again in Saratoga - that I could see their faces, and&#xD;
hear their voices calling me. Awakening from the&#xD;
pleasant phantasms of sleep to the bitter realities&#xD;
around me, I could but groan and weep. Still my&#xD;
spirit was not broken. I indulged the anticipation of&#xD;
escape, and that speedily.. It was impossible, I rea-&#xD;
soned, that men could be so unjust as to detain me as&#xD;
a slave, when the truth of my case was known.&#xD;
Burch, ascertaining I was no runaway from Georgia,&#xD;
would certainly let me go. Though suspicions of&#xD;

RAY, WILLIAMS AND RANDALL.&#xD;
&#xD;
48           TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
Brown and Hamilton were not infrequent, I could&#xD;
not reconcile myself to the idea that they were in-&#xD;
strumental to my imprisonment. Surely they would&#xD;
seek me out-they would deliver me from thraldom.&#xD;
Alas! I had not then learned the measure of "man's&#xD;
inhumanity to man," nor to what limitless extent of&#xD;
wickedness he will go for the love of gain.&#xD;
In the course of several days the outer door was&#xD;
thrown open, allowing me the liberty of the yard.&#xD;
There I found three slaves -one of them a lad of ten&#xD;
years, the others youn men of about twenty and&#xD;
twenty-five. I was not ong in forming an acquaint-&#xD;
ance, and learning their names and the particulars of&#xD;
-   their history.&#xD;
The eldest was a colored man named Clemens Ray.&#xD;
He had lived in Washington; had driven a hack, and&#xD;
worked ii a livery stable there for a long time. He&#xD;
was very i telligent, and fully comprehended his sit-&#xD;
uation. The thought of going south overwhelmed&#xD;
him with grief. Burch had purchased him a few&#xD;
days before, and had placed him there until such time&#xD;
as he was ready to send him to the New-Orleans mar&#xD;
ket. From him I learned for the first time that I was&#xD;
in William's Slave Pen, a place I had never heard of&#xD;
previously. He described to me the uses for which&#xD;
it was designed. I repeated to him the particulars of&#xD;
my unhappy story, but he could only give me the&#xD;
consolation of his sympathy. He also advised me to&#xD;
be silent henceforth on the subject of my freedom;&#xD;
for, knowing the character of Burch, he assumed me&#xD;
&#xD;
49&#xD;
&#xD;
that it would only be attended with renewed whip-&#xD;
ping. The next eldest was named John Williams. He&#xD;
was raised in Virginia, not far from  Washington.&#xD;
Burch had taken him in payment of a debt, and he&#xD;
constantly entertained the hope that his master would&#xD;
redeem him - a hope that was subsequently realized.&#xD;
The lad was a sprightly child, that answered to~ the&#xD;
name of Randall. Most of the time he was playing&#xD;
about the yard, but occasionally would cry, calling&#xD;
for his mother, .anc wondering when she would come.&#xD;
His mother's absence seemed to be the great and only&#xD;
grief in his little heart. le was too young to realize&#xD;
his condition, and when the memory of his mother&#xD;
was not in his mind, he amused us with his pleasant&#xD;
pranks.&#xD;
At night,'Ray, Williams, and the boy, slept in the&#xD;
loft of the shed, while I was locked in the cell. Fi-&#xD;
nally we were each provided with blankets, such as&#xD;
are used upon horses  the only bedding I was allow-&#xD;
ed 'to have for twelve years afterwards. Ray and&#xD;
Williams asked me many questions about New-York&#xD;
-how colored people were treated there ; how they&#xD;
could have homes and families of their own, with none&#xD;
to disturb and oppress them; and Ray, especially,&#xD;
sighed continually for freedom. Such conversations,&#xD;
however, were not in the hearing of Burch, or the&#xD;
keeper-Radburn. Aspirations such as these would&#xD;
have brought down the lash upon our backs.&#xD;
It is necessary in this narrative, in order to present.&#xD;

TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
in the history of my life, and to portray the institu&#xD;
tion of Slavery as I have seen anc known it, to speak&#xD;
of well-known places, and of many persons who are&#xD;
yet living.. I am, and always was, an entire stranger&#xD;
in Washington and its vicinity - aside from Burch&#xD;
and Radburn, knowing no man there, except as Ihave&#xD;
heard of them through my enslave4 companions.&#xD;
What I am about to say, if false, can be easily con-&#xD;
tradicted.&#xD;
I remained in Williams' slave pen about two&#xD;
weeks. The night previous to my departure a woman&#xD;
was brought in, weeping bitterly, and leading by the&#xD;
hand a little child. They were Randall's mother and&#xD;
half-sister. On meeting them he was overjoyed,&#xD;
clinging to her dress, kissing the child, and exhibit-&#xD;
ing every demonstration of delight. The mother also&#xD;
clasped him in her arms, embraced him tenderly, and&#xD;
gazed at him fondly through her tears, calling him by&#xD;
many an endearing name.&#xD;
Emily, the child, was seven or eight years old, of&#xD;
light complexion, and with a face of admirable beau-&#xD;
ty. Her hair fell in curls around her neck, while the&#xD;
style and richness of her dress, and the neatness of&#xD;
her whole appearance indicated she had been brought&#xD;
up in the midst of wealth. She was a sweet child&#xD;
indeed. The woman also was arrayed in silk, with&#xD;
rings upon her fingers, and golden ornaments sus-&#xD;
pended from her ears. Her air and manners, the cor-&#xD;
rectness and propriety of her language -all showed,&#xD;
evidently, that she had sometime -stood above the&#xD;
&#xD;
conunfllon level of a slave. She seemed. to be amazed&#xD;
at finding herself in such a place as that. It was&#xD;
laimly a sudden and unexpected turn of fortune that&#xD;
had brought her there. Filling the air with her con-&#xD;
painings, she was hustled, with the children and my-&#xD;
self into the cell. Language can convey but an iiad-&#xD;
equate impression of the lamentations to which she&#xD;
ave incessant utterance. Throwing herself upon the&#xD;
loor, and encircling the children in her arms, she&#xD;
poured forth such touching .words as only maternal&#xD;
love and kindness can suggest. They nestled closely&#xD;
to her, as if there only was there aiy safety or pro-&#xD;
tection. At last they slept, their heads resting upon&#xD;
her lap. While they slumbered, she smoothed the&#xD;
hair back from their little foreheads, and talked to&#xD;
them all night long. She called them her darlings -&#xD;
her sweet babes-poor innocent things, that knew&#xD;
not the misery they were destined to endure. Soon&#xD;
they would have no mother to comfort them -they&#xD;
would be taken from her. What would beconie of&#xD;
them? Oh ! she could. not live away from her little&#xD;
Emmy and her clear boy. TheyI had always been&#xD;
good children, and had such loving ways. It would&#xD;
break her heart, God knew, she said, if they were ta-&#xD;
ken from her ; and yet she knew they meant to sell&#xD;
them, and, may be, they would be separated, and&#xD;
could never see each other any more. It was enough&#xD;
to melt a heart of stone to listen to the pitiful ex-&#xD;
pressions of that desolate and distracted mother. iier&#xD;

TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;

&#xD;
THE STORY OF ELIZA.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
name was Eliza; and this was the story of her life, as&#xD;
she afterwards related it:&#xD;
She was the slave of Elisha Berry, a rich man, liv-&#xD;
ing in the neighborhood of Washington. She was&#xD;
born, I think she said, on his plantation. Years be-&#xD;
fore, he had fallen into dissipated habits, and quarrel-&#xD;
ed with his wife. In fact, soon after the birth of&#xD;
Iandall, they separated. Leaving his wife and daugh-&#xD;
ter in the house they had always occupied, he erected&#xD;
a new one near by, on the estate. Into this house he&#xD;
brought Eliza; and, on condition of her living with&#xD;
him, she and her children were to be emancipated.&#xD;
She resided with him there nine years, with servants&#xD;
to attend upon her, and providedwith every comfort&#xD;
and luxury of life. Emily was his child ! Finally,&#xD;
her young mistress, who had always remained with&#xD;
her mother at the homestead, married a Mr. Jacob&#xD;
Brooks. At length, for some cause, (as I gathered&#xD;
from her relation,) beyond Berry's control, a division&#xD;
of his property was made. She and her children fell&#xD;
to the share of Mr. Brooks. During the nine years&#xD;
she had lived with Berry, in consequence of the posi-&#xD;
tion she was compelled to occupy, she and Euily had&#xD;
become the object of Mrs. Berry and her daughter's&#xD;
hatred and dislike. Berry himself she represented as&#xD;
a man of naturally a kind heart, who always pronis-&#xD;
ed her that she should have her freedom, and who,&#xD;
she had no doubt, would grant it to her then, if it&#xD;
were only in his power. As soon as they thus came&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
into the possession and control of the daughter, it be-&#xD;
came very manifest they would not live long together.&#xD;
The sight of Eliza seemed to be odious to Mrs. Brooks-;&#xD;
neither could she bear to look upon the child, half-&#xD;
isterI, and beautihid as she was&#xD;
rTie (Thy she was led into the pen, Brooks had&#xD;
I) ' j_]t her. from the estate into the city,.under pro-&#xD;
te7ieCOtbat;; the time had come when her free papers&#xD;
were to be executed, in fulfillment of her master's&#xD;
proiHse. Elated at the prospect of inuediate liber-&#xD;
ty, she decked herself iand little Eummy in their best&#xD;
a-p arel, and accompanied him with a joyful heart.&#xD;
On their arrival in the city, instead of being baptized&#xD;
into t1e family of freemen, she was delivered to the&#xD;
trader Biurch. The paper that was executed was a&#xD;
bill of sale.  lhe hope of years was blasted in a nio-&#xD;
ment. From   the eight of most exulting happiness&#xD;
to the utmost depths of wretchedness, she had that&#xD;
day descended. No wonder that she wept, and filled&#xD;
the pen with waihings and expressions of heart-rend-&#xD;
'      1ing woe&#xD;
Ehizais now dead. Far up the red River, where&#xD;
it pours its waters sluggishly through the unhealthy&#xD;
low lands of Lomsiana, she rests in the grave at last-&#xD;
the only resting place of the poor slave! How all her&#xD;
fears were realized -how she mourned day and night,&#xD;
and never would be comforted-how, as she predict-&#xD;
A  ~  ed, her heart did indeed break, with the burden of&#xD;
maternal sorrow, will be seen as the narrative pro-&#xD;
ceeds.&#xD;

AT intervals during the first night of Eliza's incar-&#xD;
ceration in the pen, she complained bitterly of Jacob&#xD;
Brooks, her young nistress' husband. -She declared&#xD;
that had she been aware of the decepfIon he intended-&#xD;
to practice upon her, he niever would have brought&#xD;
her there alive. They had chosen the opportunity of&#xD;
getting her away when Master Berry was absent from&#xD;
the plantation. He had always been kind to her.&#xD;
She wished that she could see hin; but she knew that&#xD;
even lie was unable now to rescue her.     Then would&#xD;
she commence weeping again - kissing the sleeping&#xD;
children-talking first to one, then to the other, as&#xD;
they lay in their unconscious slumbers, with their&#xD;
heads upon her lap.    So wore the long night away;&#xD;
and when the morning dawned, and night had come&#xD;
again, still she kept mourning on, and would not be&#xD;
consoled.&#xD;
&#xD;
About midnight following, the cell door opened,&#xD;
and Burch and Radburn entered, with lanterns in&#xD;
their hands. Burch, withan oath, ordered us to roll&#xD;
up our blankets without delay, and get ready to go&#xD;
on board the boat. He swore we would be left unless&#xD;
we hurried fast. He aroused the children from their&#xD;
slumbers with a rough shake, and said they were&#xD;
d-d sleepy, it appeared. Going out into the yard,&#xD;
he called Clem Ray, ordering him to leave the loft&#xD;
and come into the cell, and bring his blanket with&#xD;
him. When Clem appeared, he placed us side by&#xD;
side, and fastened us together with hand-cuffs-my&#xD;
left hand to his right. John Williams had been ta-&#xD;
ken out a day or two before, his master having&#xD;
redeemed him, greatly to his delight. Clem and I&#xD;
were ordered to march, Eliza and the children fol-&#xD;
lowing. We were conducted tino the yard, from&#xD;
thence into the covered passage, and up a flight of&#xD;
steps through a side door into the'upper room, where&#xD;
I had heard the walking to and fro. Its furniture was&#xD;
a stove, a few old chairs, and a long table, covered&#xD;
with papers. It was a white-washed room, without&#xD;
any carpet on the floor, and seemed a sort of office.&#xD;
By one of the windows, I remember, hung a rusty&#xD;
sword, which attracted my attention. Burch's trunk&#xD;
was there. In obedience to his orders, I took hold of&#xD;
one of its handles with my unfettered hand, while he&#xD;
taking hold of the other, we proceeded out of the&#xD;
front door into the street in the same order as we had&#xD;
left the cell.&#xD;

TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
It was a dark night. All was quiet. I could see&#xD;
lights, or the reflection of them, over towards Penn-&#xD;
sylvania Avenue, but there was no one, not even a&#xD;
straggler, to be seen. I was almost resolved to at-&#xD;
tempt to break away. Had I. not been hand-cuffed&#xD;
the attempt would certainly have been made, what-&#xD;
ever consequence nght have followed. Radburn&#xD;
was in the rear, carrying a large stick, and hurrying&#xD;
up the children as fast as the little ones could walk.&#xD;
So we passed, hand-cuffed and in silence, through the&#xD;
streets of Washington through the Capital of a na-&#xD;
tion, whose theory of government, we are told, rests&#xD;
on the foundation of man's inalienable right, to life&#xD;
LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness hIail! Co-&#xD;
lumbia, happy land, indeed !&#xD;
Reaching the steamboat, we were quickly hustled&#xD;
into the hold, among barrels and boxes of freight. A&#xD;
colored servant brought a light, the bell rung, and&#xD;
soon the vessel started down the, Potomac, carrying&#xD;
us we knew not where. The bell tolled as we passed&#xD;
the tomb of Washington ! Lurch, no doubt, with un-&#xD;
covered head, bowed ,reverently before the sacred ash-&#xD;
es of the man who. devoted his illustrious life to the&#xD;
liberty of his country.&#xD;
None of us slept that night. but Randall and little&#xD;
Emmy. For the first time Clem Ray was wholly&#xD;
overcome. To him the idea of going south was ter&#xD;
rible in the extreme. He was leaving the friends and&#xD;
associations of his youth - every thing that was dear&#xD;
and precious to his heart-in all probability never&#xD;
&#xD;
BREAKFAST ON THE STEAMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
to return. le and Eliza mingled their tears-together,&#xD;
bemoaning their cruel fate. For my own part, diffi-&#xD;
cult as it was, I endeavored to keep up my spirits. I&#xD;
resolved in my mind a hundred )lais of escape, and&#xD;
fully determmnied to make the attempt the first despe-&#xD;
rate chance that offered. I had by this time become&#xD;
satisfied, however, that my true policy was to say no-&#xD;
thing further,-on the subject of my having been born a&#xD;
freeman. It would but expose mUe to mal-tieatment,&#xD;
and diminish the chances of liberation.&#xD;
After sunrise in the morning we were called up on&#xD;
deck to breakfast. Burch took our hand-cuffs off, and&#xD;
we sat down to table. He asked Eliza if she would&#xD;
take a dram. She declined, thanking him politely.&#xD;
During the meal we were all silent -not a word pass-&#xD;
::    ed between us. A mulatto woman who served at ta-&#xD;
ble seemed to take an interest in our behalf- told us&#xD;
to cheer up, and not to be so cast down. -Breakfast&#xD;
over, the hand-cuffs were restored, and lurch ordered&#xD;
us out on the stern deck. We sat down together on&#xD;
some boxes, still saying nothimg inBurch's presence.&#xD;
Occasionally a passenger -would walk out to where&#xD;
we were look at us for a while, then silently return.&#xD;
It was a very pleasant morning. The fields along&#xD;

the river were covered with verdure, far in advance&#xD;
of what I had been accustomed to see at that season&#xD;
of the year. The sun shone out warmly ; the birds&#xD;
were singing in 'the trees. The happy birds - I en-&#xD;
vied them. I wished for wings like them, that I&#xD;
might cleave the air to where my birdlings waited&#xD;

vainly for their father's coming, in the cooler region&#xD;
of the North.&#xD;
In the forenoon the steamer reached Aquia Creek.&#xD;
There the passengers took stages - Burch and his five&#xD;
slaves occupying one exclusively. He laughed with&#xD;
the children, and at one stopping place went so far as&#xD;
to purchase them a piece of gingerbread. He told&#xD;
me to hold up my head and look smart. That I&#xD;
might, perhaps, get a good master if I behaved my-&#xD;
self. I made him no reply. His face was hateful to&#xD;
me, and I could not bear to look upon it. I sat in&#xD;
the corner, cherishing.in my heart the hope, not yet&#xD;
extinct, of some day meeting the tyrant on the soil of&#xD;
my native State.&#xD;
At Fredericksburgh we were transferred from the&#xD;
stage coach to a car, and before dark arrived in Rich-&#xD;
mond, the chief city of Virginia. At this city we&#xD;
were taken. from the cars, and driven through the&#xD;
street to a slave pen, between the railroad depot and&#xD;
the river, kept by a Mr. Goodin. This pen is similar&#xD;
to Williams' in Washington, except it is somewhat&#xD;
larger; and besides, there were two small houses&#xD;
standing at opposite corners within the yard. These&#xD;
houses are susu ally found within slave yards, being&#xD;
used as rooms for the examination of human chattels&#xD;
by purchasers before concluding a bargain. Un-&#xD;
soundness in a slave, as well as in a horse, detracts&#xD;
materially from his value. If no warranty is given,&#xD;
a close examination is a matter of particular impor-&#xD;
tance to the negro jockey.&#xD;
&#xD;
GOODIN AND HIS SLAVE PEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
We were met at the door of Goodin's yard by that&#xD;
gentleman himself--a short, fat man, with a round,&#xD;
plump face, black hair and whiskers, and a complex-&#xD;
ion almost as dark as some of his own negroes. He&#xD;
had a hard stern look, and was perhaps about fifty&#xD;
years of age. Burch and he met with great cordiali-&#xD;
ty. They were evidently old friends. Shaking each&#xD;
other warmly by'the hand, Burch remarked he had&#xD;
brought some company, inquired at what time the&#xD;
brig would leave, and was answered that it would&#xD;
probably leave the next day at such an hour. Good-&#xD;
in then turned to me, took hold of my arm, turned&#xD;
me partly round, looked t me sharply with the air of&#xD;
one who considered himself a good judge of property,&#xD;
and as if estimating in his own mind about how&#xD;
much I was worth.&#xD;
"Well, boy, where did you come from ?"&#xD;
Forgetting myself, for a moment, I answered,&#xD;
"From New-York."&#xD;
"New-York ! 11-1! what have you been doing&#xD;
up there ?" was his astonished interrogatory.&#xD;
Observing Burch at this moment looking at me-with&#xD;
an angry expression that conveyed a meaning it was&#xD;
not difcult to understand, I immediately said, "Q0, I&#xD;
have only been up that way a piede," in a manner&#xD;
intended to imply that although I might have'been as&#xD;
far as New-York, yet I wished it distinctly understood&#xD;
that I did not belong to that free State, nor to-any&#xD;
Other.&#xD;
Goodin then turned to Clem, and then to Eliza and&#xD;

the children, examining them severally, and' asking&#xD;
.various questions. lie was pleased with Emily, as&#xD;
was every one who saw the child's sweet countenance.&#xD;
She was not as tidy as when I first beheld her; her&#xD;
hair was now somewhat disheveled; but through its&#xD;
unkempt and soft profusion there still beamed a little&#xD;
face of most surpassing loveliness. " Altogether we&#xD;
were a fair lot--a devilish good lot," he said, enforc-&#xD;
ing that opinion with more than one emphatic adjec-&#xD;
tive not found in the Christian vocabulary. Thereup-&#xD;
on we passed into the yard. Quite a number of&#xD;
slaves, as many as thirty I should say, were moving&#xD;
about, or sitting on benches under the shed. They&#xD;
were all cleanly dressed - the men with hats, the *o-&#xD;
men with handkerchiefs tied about their heads.&#xD;
Burch and Goodin, after separating from us, walk-&#xD;
ed up the steps at the back part of the main building,&#xD;
and sat down upon the door sill. They entered into&#xD;
conversation, but the subject of it I could not hear.&#xD;
Presently Burch came down into the yardunfettered&#xD;
me, and led me into one of the small houses.&#xD;
"You told that man you came from New-York,"&#xD;
said he.&#xD;
I replied, "I told him I had been up as far as New-&#xD;
York, to be sure, but did not tell him I belonged&#xD;
there, nor that I was a freeman. I meant no harm at&#xD;
all, Master Burch. I would not have said it had I&#xD;
thought."&#xD;
He looked at me a moment as if he was ready to'&#xD;
devour me, then tuning round went out. In a few&#xD;
&#xD;
ROBERT, OF CINCINNATI.&#xD;
&#xD;
61&#xD;
&#xD;
minutes he returned. "If ever I hear you say a word&#xD;
about New-York, or about your freedom, I will be the&#xD;
death of you --I will kill you; you may rely on&#xD;
that," he ejaculated fiercely.&#xD;
I doubt not he understood then better than I did,&#xD;
the danger and the penalty of selling a free man into&#xD;
slavery, He felt the necessity of closing my mouth&#xD;
against the crime he knew he was committing. Of&#xD;
course, my life would not have weighed a feather, .in&#xD;
any emergency requiring such a sacrifice. Undoubt-&#xD;
edly, he meant precisely what he said.&#xD;
Under the shed on 8one side of the yard; there was&#xD;
constructed a rough table, while overhead were sleep-&#xD;
ing lofts - the same as in the pen at Washington. Af-&#xD;
ter partaking at this table of our supper of pork and&#xD;
bread, I was hand-cuffed to a large yellow man, quite&#xD;
stout and fleshy, with a countenance, expressive of&#xD;
the utmost melancholy. He was'a man of intelli-&#xD;
gence and information. Chained together, it was not&#xD;
long before we became acquainted with each other's&#xD;
history. His name was Robert. Like myself, he&#xD;
had beei born free, and had a wife and two chil-&#xD;
dren in Cincinnati. He said he had come south with&#xD;
two men, who had hired im in the city of his resi-&#xD;
deuce. Without free papers, he had 'been seized at&#xD;
Fredericksbirgh, placed in confinement, and beaten&#xD;
until he had learned, as I had, the necessity and the&#xD;
policy of silence. lie had been in Goodin's pen&#xD;
about three weeks. To this man I became much&#xD;
attached. We could sympathie with, and understand&#xD;

each other. It was with tears and a heavy heart,&#xD;
not many days subsequently, that I saw him die, and&#xD;
looked for the last time upon his lifeless form!&#xD;
Roberi and myself, with Clem, Eliza and her chil-&#xD;
dren, slept that night upon our blankets, in one of the&#xD;
small houses in the yard. There were four others, all&#xD;
from the same plantation, who had been sold, and&#xD;
were now on their way south, who also occupied it&#xD;
with us. David and his wife, Caroline, both mulat-&#xD;
toes, were exceedingly affected. They dreaded the&#xD;
thought of being put into the cane and cotton fields;&#xD;
but their greatest source of anxiety was the apprehen-&#xD;
sion of being separated. Mary, a tall, lithe girl, of a&#xD;
most jetty black, was listless and apparently indiffer-&#xD;
ent. Like many of the class, she scarcely knew there&#xD;
was such a word as- freedom. Brought up in the ig-&#xD;
norance of a brute, she possessed but little more than&#xD;
a brute's intelligence. She was one of those, and&#xD;
there are very many, who fear nothing but their mas-&#xD;
ter's lash, and know no further duty than to obey his&#xD;
voice. .The other was Lethe. She was of an entirely&#xD;
different character. /She had long, straight 'hair, and&#xD;
bore more the appearance of an Indian than a negro&#xD;
woman. She had sharp and spiteful eyes, and con-&#xD;
tinually gave utterance to the language of hatred&#xD;
and revenge. 11cr husband had been sold. She&#xD;
knew not where she was. An exchange of masters,&#xD;
she was sure, could not be for the worse. She cared&#xD;
not whither they might carry her. Pointing to the&#xD;
scars upon her face, the desperate creature wished&#xD;
&#xD;
that slie might see the day when she could wipe them&#xD;
off in some man's blood !&#xD;
While we were thus learning the history of each&#xD;
other's wretchedness, Eliza was seated in a corner by&#xD;
herself, singing hymns and praying for her children.&#xD;
Wearied from the loss of so much sleep, I could no&#xD;
longer bear up against the advances of that "sweet&#xD;
restorer," and laying down by the side of Robert, on&#xD;
the floor, soon forgot my troubles, and slept until the&#xD;
dawn of day.&#xD;
In the morning, having swept the yard, and wash-&#xD;
ed ourselves, under Goodin's superintendence, we&#xD;
were ordered to roll up our blankets, and make ready&#xD;
for the continuance of our journey  Clem Ray was&#xD;
informed that he would go no further, Burch, for some&#xD;
cause, having concluded to carry him back to Wash-&#xD;
ington. le was much rejoiced.. Shaking hands, we&#xD;
parted in the slave pen at Richmond, and I have not&#xD;
seen him since. But, much to my surprise, since my&#xD;
return, I learned that he had escaped from bondage,&#xD;
and on his way to the free soil of Canada, lodged one&#xD;
night at the house of my brother-in-law in Saratoga,&#xD;
informing my family of the place and the condition&#xD;
in which he left me.&#xD;
In the afternoon we were drawn up, two abreast,&#xD;
Robert and myself in advance, and in this order, driv-&#xD;
en by Burch, and Goodin from the yard, through the&#xD;
'streets of Richmond to the brig Orleans. She was&#xD;
a vessel.of respectable size, full rigged, and freighted&#xD;
principally with tobacco. We were all on board by&#xD;

five o'clock. Burch brought us each a tin cup and a&#xD;
spoon. There were forty of us in the brig, being all,&#xD;
except Clem, that wer e in the pen.&#xD;
With , small pocket knife that had not been taken&#xD;
from me, I began cutting the initials of my name&#xD;
upon the tin cup. The others immediately flocked&#xD;
round me, requesting ine to mark theirs in a similar&#xD;
manner. In time, I gratified them all, of which they&#xD;
(did not appear to be forgetful,&#xD;
We were all stowed away in the hold at night, and&#xD;
the hatch barred down. We laid on boxes, or where-&#xD;
ever there was room enough to stretch our blankets&#xD;
on the floor.&#xD;
Burch accompanied us no farther than Richmond,&#xD;
returning from that point to the capital with Clem.&#xD;
Not until the lapse of almost twelve-years, to wit, in&#xD;
January last, in the Washington police office, did I&#xD;
set my eyes upon his face again.&#xD;
James If. Burch was a slave-trader -buying men,&#xD;
women and children at low prices, and selling them&#xD;
at an advance. He was a speculator in human fi'esh&#xD;
- a disreputable calling-and so considered at the&#xD;
South. For the present he disappears from the scenes&#xD;
recorded in this narrative, but he will appear again&#xD;
before its close, not in the character of a man-whip~&#xD;
ping tyrant, but as an arrested, cringing criminal in&#xD;
a court of law, that failed to do him justice.&#xD;

ASrER we were all on board, the brig Orleans pro-&#xD;
ceeded down James River. Passing into Chesapeake&#xD;
Bay, we arrived next day opposite the'city of Nor-&#xD;
folk. While lying at anchor, a lighter approached&#xD;
us from the town, bringing four more slaves. Frede-&#xD;
rick, a boy of eighteen, had been born a slave, as also&#xD;
had -lenry, who was some years older. They had&#xD;
both been.house servants in the city. Maria was a&#xD;
rather genteel looking colored girl,. with a faultless.&#xD;
form, but ignorant and extremely vain. The idea of&#xD;
going to New-Orleans was pleasing to her. She en-&#xD;
tertained an extravagantly high opinion of her own&#xD;
attractions.  Assuming a haughty mien, she declared&#xD;
to her companions, that immediately on our arrival&#xD;
in New-Orleans, she had no doubt, some wealthy sin-&#xD;
gle gentleman of good taste would purchase her at&#xD;
once!&#xD;

&#xD;
JIM, CUFFEE AND JENNY.&#xD;
&#xD;
But the most prominent of the four, was a man&#xD;
named Arthur. As the lighter approached, he strug-&#xD;
gled stoutly with his. keepers. It was with main&#xD;
force that he was dragged aboard the brig. He pro-&#xD;
tested, in a loud voice, against the treatment he was&#xD;
receiving, and demanded to be released. His face&#xD;
was swollen, and, covered with wounds and bruises,&#xD;
and, deed, one side of it was a complete raw sore.&#xD;
He was forced, with all haste, down the hatchway&#xD;
into the hold. I caught an outline of his story as lie&#xD;
was borne struggling along,. of which he afterwards&#xD;
gave me a more full relation, and it was as follows:&#xD;
He had long resided in the city of Norfolk, and was&#xD;
a free man. He had a family living there, and was a&#xD;
mason by trade. Having been unusually detained,&#xD;
he was returning late one night to his house in the&#xD;
suburbs of the city, when he was attacked by a gang&#xD;
of persons in an unfrequented street. He fought&#xD;
until his strength failed him. Overpowered at last,&#xD;
he was gagged and bound with ropes, and beaten,&#xD;
until he became insensible. For several days they&#xD;
secreted him in the slave pen at Norfolk -a very&#xD;
common establishment, it appears, in the cities of the&#xD;
South. The night before, he had been taken out and&#xD;
put on board the lighter, which, pushing out from&#xD;
shore, had awaited our arrival. For some time he&#xD;
continued his protestations, and was altogether irrec-&#xD;
oncilable. At length, however, he became silent.&#xD;
He sank into a gloomy and thoughtful mood, and ap-&#xD;
peared to be counseling with himself. There was in&#xD;
&#xD;
 the man's determined face, something that suggested&#xD;
the thou ght of desperation.&#xD;
After leaving Norfolk the hand-cuffs were taken&#xD;
off, and during the day we were allowed to remain&#xD;
on deck. The captain selected Robert as his waiter,&#xD;
and I was appointed to superintend the cooking de-&#xD;
partmiient, and the distribution of food and water. I&#xD;
had three assistants, Jim, Cuffie and Jenny. Jenny's&#xD;
business was to prepare the coffee, which consisted of&#xD;
corn meal scorched in a kettle, boiled and sweetened&#xD;
withg molasses. Jim and Cuffee baked the. hoe-cake&#xD;
and boiled the bacon.&#xD;
Standing by a table, formed of a wide board rest-&#xD;
ing on the heads of the barrels, I cut and handed to&#xD;
each a slice of meat and a " dodger" of the bread,&#xD;
and from Jenny's. kettle also dipped out for each a&#xD;
cup of the coffee. The use of plates was dispensed&#xD;
with, and their sable fingers took the place of knives&#xD;
and forks. Jun and Ouffee were very demure and&#xD;
attentive to business, somewhat inflated with their&#xD;
situation as second cooks, and without doubt feeling&#xD;
that there was a great responsibility resting on them.&#xD;
I was called steward-a name given me by the cap-&#xD;
tain.&#xD;
The slaves were fed twice a day, at ten and five&#xD;
o'clock - always receiving the same kind and quantity&#xD;
of fare, and in the same manner as above described.&#xD;
At night we were driven:into the hold, and securely&#xD;
fastened down.&#xD;
Scarcely were we out of sight of land before we&#xD;

b8           TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
were overtaken by a violent storm. The brig rolled&#xD;
and plunged until we feared she would go down.&#xD;
Some were sea-sick, others on their knees praying,&#xD;
while some were fast holding to each other, paralyzed&#xD;
with fear. The sea-sickness rendered the place of our&#xD;
confinement loathsome and disgusting. It would&#xD;
have been a happy thing for most of us-it would&#xD;
have saved the agony of many hundred lashes, and&#xD;
miserable deaths at last -had the compassionate sea&#xD;
snatched us that day from the clutches of remorseless&#xD;
men. The thought of Randall and little Enmy sink-&#xD;
ing down among the monsters of the deep, is a more&#xD;
pleasant contemplation thai to think of them, as they&#xD;
are now, perhaps, dragging out lives of unrequited&#xD;
toil.&#xD;
When in sight of the Bahama Banks, at a place&#xD;
called Old Point Compass, or the Hole in the Wall,&#xD;
we were becalmed three days. There was scarcely a&#xD;
breath of air. The waters of the gulf presented a&#xD;
singularly white appearance, like lime water.&#xD;
In the order of events, I come now to the relation&#xD;
of an occurrence, which I never call to mind but with&#xD;
sensations. of regret. I thank God, who has since&#xD;
permitted me to escape from the thralldom of slavery,&#xD;
that through his merciful interposition I was prevent-&#xD;
ed from imbruing my hands in the blood of his crea-&#xD;
tures. Let not those who have never been placed in-&#xD;
like circumstances, judge me harshly. Until they&#xD;
have been chained and beaten - until they find them-&#xD;
selves in the situation I was, borne away from home&#xD;
&#xD;
TILE CONSPIRACY.&#xD;
&#xD;
and family towards a land of bondage -let them re-&#xD;
frain from saying what they would not do for liberty.&#xD;
How far I should have been justified in the:sight of&#xD;
God and man, it is unnecessary now to speculate upon.&#xD;
It is enough to say that I am able to congratulate&#xD;
myself upon the harmless termination of an affair&#xD;
which threatened, for a time, to be attended with se-&#xD;
rious results.&#xD;
Towards evening, on the first day of the calm, Ar-&#xD;
thur and myself were in the bow of the vessel, seat-&#xD;
ed on the windlass. We were 'conversing together of&#xD;
the probable destiny that awaited us, and mourning&#xD;
together over. our misfortunes. Arthur said, and I&#xD;
agreed with him, that death was far less terrible than&#xD;
the living prospect that was before us. For a long&#xD;
time we talked of our children, our past lives, and of&#xD;
the probabilities of escape. Obtaining possession of&#xD;
the brig was suggested by one of us. We discussed&#xD;
the possibility of our being able, in such an event, to&#xD;
make .our way to the harbor of New-York. I knew&#xD;
little of the compass; but the idea of risking the ex-&#xD;
periment was eagerly entertained. The chances, for&#xD;
and against us, in an encounter with the crew, was&#xD;
canvassed. Who dould be relied upon, and who&#xD;
could not, the proper time and manner of the attack,&#xD;
were all talked over and over again. From the mo-&#xD;
]ent the plot suggested itself I began to hope. I&#xD;
revolved it constantly in my mind. As difficulty af-&#xD;
ter difficulty arose, some ready conceit was at hand,&#xD;
demonstrating how it could be overcome. While&#xD;

others slept, Arthur and I were maturing our plans.&#xD;
At length, with much caution, Robert was gradually&#xD;
made acquainted with our intenticns. Ile approved&#xD;
of them at once, and entered into the conspiracy with&#xD;
a zealous spirit. There was not another slave we&#xD;
dared to trust. Brought up in fear and ignorance as&#xD;
they are, it can scarcely be conceived how servilely&#xD;
they will cringe before a white man's look. It was&#xD;
not safe to deposit so bold a secret with any of them,&#xD;
and finally we three resolved to take upon ourselves&#xD;
alone the fearful responsibility of the attempt.&#xD;
At night, as has been said, we were driven into the&#xD;
hold, and the hatch barred down. How to reach the&#xD;
deck was the first difficulty that presented itself. On&#xD;
the bow of the brig, however, I had observed the&#xD;
small boat lying bottom upwards. It occurred to me&#xD;
that by secreting ourselves underneath it, we would&#xD;
not be missed from the crowd, as they were hurried&#xD;
down into the hold at night. I was selected to make&#xD;
the experiment, in order to satisfy ourselves of its fea-&#xD;
sibility. The next evening, accordingly, after supper,&#xD;
watching my opportunity, I hastily concealed myself&#xD;
beneath it. iLying close upon the deck, I could see&#xD;
what was going on around me, while wholly unper-&#xD;
ceived myself. In the morning, as they came up, I&#xD;
slipped from my hiding place without being observed.&#xD;
The result was entirely satisfactory.&#xD;
The captain and mate slept in the cabin of the for-&#xD;
mer. From Robert, who had frequent occasion, in,&#xD;
his capacity of waiter, to make observations in that&#xD;

PT'&#xD;
&#xD;
quarter, we ascertained the exact position of their&#xD;
respective berths. He further informed us that there&#xD;
were always two pistols and a cutlass lying' on the&#xD;
table. The crew's cook slept in the cook galley on&#xD;
deck, a sort of vehicle on wheels, that could be mov-&#xD;
ed about as convenience required, while the sailors,&#xD;
..N- numbering only six, either slept in the forecastle, or&#xD;
in hammocks swung among the rigging.&#xD;
Finally our arrangements were all completed. Ar-&#xD;
thur and I were to steal silently to the captain's cab-&#xD;
in, seize the pistols and cutlass, and as quickly as possi-&#xD;
ble despatch him and the mate. Robert, with a club,&#xD;
was to stand by the door leading from the desk down&#xD;
y into the cabin, and, in case of necessity, beat back the&#xD;
sailors, until we could hurry to his assistance. We&#xD;
were to proceed then as circumstances might require.&#xD;
Should the attack be so sudden and successful as to&#xD;
prevent resistance, the hatch was to remain barred&#xD;
down; otherwise the slaves were to be called up, and&#xD;
in the crowd, and hurry, and confusion of the time,&#xD;
we resolved to regain our liberty or lose our lives. I&#xD;
was then to assume the unaccustomed place- of pilot,&#xD;
and, steering northward, we trusted that some lucky&#xD;
wind might bear us to the soil of freedom.&#xD;
The mate's name was Biddee, the captain's I can-&#xD;
not now recall, though I rarely ever forget a name&#xD;
once heard. The captain was a small., genteel man,&#xD;
erect and prompt, with a proud bearing, and looked&#xD;
the personification of courage. If he is still living,&#xD;

will learn a fact connected with the voyage of the&#xD;
brig, from Richmond to New-Orleans, in 1841, not&#xD;
entered on his log-book.&#xD;
We were all prepared, and impatiently waiting an&#xD;
opportunity of putting our designs into execution,&#xD;
when they were frustrated by a sad and unforeseen&#xD;
event. Robert was taken ill. It was soon announced&#xD;
that he had the small-pox. He continued to grow&#xD;
worse, and four days previous to our arrival in New-&#xD;
Orleans he died. One of the sailors sewed him in his&#xD;
blanket, with a large stone from the ballast at his feet,&#xD;
and then laying him on a hatchway, and elevating it&#xD;
with tackles above the railing, the inanimate body of&#xD;
poor Robert was consigned to the white waters of the&#xD;
gulf.&#xD;
We were all panic-stricken by the appearance of&#xD;
the small-pox. The captain ordered lime to be scat-&#xD;
tered through the hold, and other prudent precau-&#xD;
tions to be taken. The death of Robert, however, and&#xD;
the presence of the malady, oppressed me sadly, and&#xD;
I gazed out over the great waste of waters with a&#xD;
spirit that was indeed disconsolate.&#xD;
An evening or two after Robert's burial, I was&#xD;
leaning on the hatchway near the forecastle, full of&#xD;
desponding thoughts, when a sailor in a kind voice&#xD;
asked me why I was so down-hearted. The tone and&#xD;
manner of the man assured me, and I answered, be&#xD;
cause I was a freeman, and had been kidnapped.&#xD;
He remarked that it was enough to make any ono&#xD;
down-hearted, and continued to interrogate me until&#xD;

&#xD;
he learned the particulars of my whole history. He&#xD;
was evidently much interested in my behalf, and, in&#xD;
the blunt speech of a sailor, swore he would aid me&#xD;
all he could, if it "split his timbers." I requested&#xD;
him to furnish me pen, ink and papers in order that I&#xD;
might write to some of my friends. He promised to&#xD;
obtain them - but how I could use them undiscover-&#xD;
ed was a difficulty, if I could only get.into the fore-&#xD;
castle while his watch was off, and the other sailors&#xD;
asleep, the thing could be accomplished. The small&#xD;
boat instantly occurred to me. He thought we were&#xD;
not far from the Balize, at the mouth of the Mississip-&#xD;
pi, and it was necessary that the letter be written&#xD;
soon, or the opportunity would be lost. Accordingly,&#xD;
by arrangement, I managed the next night to secret&#xD;
myself again under the long-boat. His watch was off&#xD;
at twelve. I saw him pass into the forecastle, and in&#xD;
about an hour followed, him. He was nodding over&#xD;
a table, half asleep, on which a sickly light was flick-&#xD;
ering, and on which also was a pen and sheet of. pa-&#xD;
per. As I entered lie aroused, beckoned me to a seat&#xD;
beside him, and pointed to the paper. I directed the&#xD;
letter to IIenry B. Northup, of Sandy Hill -stating&#xD;
that I had been kidnapped, was then on board the&#xD;
brig Orleans, bound for New-Orleans; that it was&#xD;
then impossible for me to conjecture my ultiznate des-&#xD;
tination, and requesting he would take measures to&#xD;
rescue me. The letter was sealed and directed, and&#xD;
Manning, having read it, promised to deposit it in the&#xD;
New-Orleans post-office. " I hastened back to my place&#xD;

TWELVE YEARS A SLAvE.&#xD;
&#xD;
under the long-boat, and in the morning, as the slaves&#xD;
came up and were walking round, crept out unno-&#xD;
ticed and mingled with them.&#xD;
My good friend, whose name was John Manning,&#xD;
was. an Englishman by birth, and a noble-hearted,&#xD;
generous sailor as ever walked a deck. ie had lived&#xD;
in Boston- was a tall, well-built man, about twenty-&#xD;
four years old, with a face somewhat pock-marked,&#xD;
but full of benevolent expression.&#xD;
. Nothing to vary the monotony of our daily life oc-&#xD;
curred, until we reached New-Orleans. On coming&#xD;
to the levee, and before the vessel was made fast, I&#xD;
saw Manning leap on shore and hurry away into the&#xD;
city. As he started off he looked back over his shioul-&#xD;
der significantly, giving me to understand the object&#xD;
of his errand. Presently he returned, and passing&#xD;
close by me, hunched me with his elbow, with a pe-&#xD;
culiar wink, as much as to say, "it is all right."&#xD;
The letter, as I have since learned, reached Sandy&#xD;
Hill. Mr. Northup visited Albany and laid it before&#xD;
Governor Seward, but inasmuch as it gave no definite&#xD;
information as to my probable locality, it was not, at&#xD;
that time, deemed advisable to institute measures for&#xD;
my liberation. It was concluded to delay, trusting&#xD;
that a knowledge of where I was might eventually be&#xD;
obtained.&#xD;
A happy and touching scene was witnessed imme-&#xD;
diately upon our reaching the levee. Just as Man-&#xD;
fling left the brig, on his way to the post-office, two&#xD;
men came up and called aloud for Arthur. The lat-&#xD;
&#xD;
ter, as lie recognized them, was almost crazy with de-&#xD;
light. He could hardly be restrained from leaping&#xD;
over the brig's side ; and when they met soon after,&#xD;
he grasped them by the hand, and clung to them a&#xD;
long, long time. They were men fiom Norfolk, who&#xD;
had come on to NewiOrleans to rescue him. His&#xD;
kidnappers, they informed him, had been arrested,&#xD;
and were then confined in the Norfolk prison. They&#xD;
conversed a few moments with the-captain, and then&#xD;
departed with the rejoicing Arthur.&#xD;
But in all the crowd that thronged the wharf, there&#xD;
was no one "who knew or cared for me. Not one.&#xD;
No familiar voice greeted my ears, nor was there a&#xD;
single face that I had ever seen. Soon Arthur would&#xD;
rejoin his family, and have the satisfaction of seeing&#xD;
his wrongs avenged: my family, alas, should I ever&#xD;
see them more ? There was a feeling of utter deso-&#xD;
lation in my heart, filling it with a despairing and re-&#xD;
gretful sense, that I had not gone down with Robert&#xD;
to the bottom of the sea.&#xD;
Very soon traders and consignees came on board.&#xD;
One, a tall, thin-faced man, with light complexion&#xD;
and a little bent, made his appearance, with a paper&#xD;
in his hand. Burch's gang, consisting of myself, Eli-&#xD;
za and her children, Harry, Lethe, and some others,&#xD;
who had joined us at Richmond, were consigned to&#xD;
him. This gentleman was Mr. Theophilus Freeman.&#xD;
Reading from his paper, he called, "Platt."  No one&#xD;
answered. The name was called again and again, but&#xD;
still there was no reply. Then Lethe was called, then&#xD;

&#xD;
Eliza, then Harry, until the list was finished, each&#xD;
one stepping forward as his or her name was called.&#xD;
"Captain, where's Platt ?" demanded Theophilus&#xD;
Freeman.&#xD;
The captain was unable to inform him, no one be-&#xD;
ing on board answering to that name.&#xD;
"Who shipped that nigger?" he again inquired of&#xD;
the captain, pointing to me.&#xD;
" Burch," replied the captain.&#xD;
"Your name is Platt -you answer my description.&#xD;
Why don't you come forward ?" he demanded of me,&#xD;
in an angry tone.&#xD;
I informed him that was not my name-; that I had&#xD;
never been called by it, but that I had no objection&#xD;
to it as I knew of.&#xD;
"Well, I will learn you your name," said he; "and&#xD;
so you won't forget it either, by  ," he added.&#xD;
Mr. Theophilus Freeman, by the way, was not a&#xD;
whit behind his partner, Burch, in the matter of blas-&#xD;
phemy. On the vessel I had gone by the name of&#xD;
"Steward," and this was the first time I had ever,&#xD;
been designated as Platt -the name forwarded by&#xD;
Burch to his consignee. From the vessel I observ-&#xD;
ed the chain-gang ait work on the levee. We passed&#xD;
near them as we were driven to Freeman's slave pen.&#xD;
This pen is very similar to Goodin's in Richmond, ex-&#xD;
cept the yard was enclosed by plank, standing up-&#xD;
right, with ends sharpened, instead of brick walls.&#xD;
Including us, there were now at least fifty in this&#xD;
pen. Depositing our blankets in one of. the small&#xD;
&#xD;
buildings in the yard, and having been called up and&#xD;
fed, we were allowed to saunter about the enclosure&#xD;
until night, when we wrapped our blankets round us&#xD;
and laid down under the shed, or in the loft, or in the&#xD;
open yard, just as each one preferred.&#xD;
It was but a short time I closed my eyes that night.&#xD;
Thought was busy in my brain. Could it be possible&#xD;
that I was thousands of miles from home -' that I had&#xD;
ben driven through the streets like a dumb beast -&#xD;
that I had been chained and beaten without mercy-&#xD;
that I was even then herded with a drove of slaves, a&#xD;
slave myself? Were the events of the last few weeks&#xD;
realities indeed ? -or was I passing only through the&#xD;
dismal phases of a long, protracted dream? It was&#xD;
no illusion. My cup of -sorrow was full to overflow-&#xD;
ing. Then I lifted up my hands to God, and in the&#xD;
still ivatches of the night, surrounded by the sleeping&#xD;
forms of my companions, begged for mercy on the&#xD;
poor, forsaken captive. To the Almighty Father of&#xD;
us all-the freeman and the slave.-I poured forth&#xD;
the supplications of a broken spirit, imploring strength&#xD;
from on high to bear up against the burden of my&#xD;
troubles, until the morning light aroused the slumber&#xD;
ers, ushering in another day of bondage.&#xD;

THE very amiable, pious-hearted Mr. Theophilus&#xD;
Freeman, partner or consignee of James I. Burch,&#xD;
and keeper of the slave pen in New-Orleans, was out&#xD;
among his animals early in the morning. With an&#xD;
occasional kick of the older men and women, and&#xD;
many a sharp crack of the whip about the ears of the&#xD;
younger slaves, it was not long before they were all&#xD;
astir, and wide awake. Mr. Theophilus Freeman&#xD;
bustled about in a very industrious manner, getting&#xD;
his property ready for the sales-room, 'intending, no&#xD;
doubt, to do that day a rousing business.&#xD;
In the fist place we were required to wash thorough-&#xD;
ly, and those with beards, to shave.    We were then&#xD;
furnished with a new suit each, cheap, but clean.&#xD;
The men had hat, coat, shirt, pants and shoes; the&#xD;
women frocks of calico, and handkerchiefs to bind&#xD;
about their heads. We were now conducted into a&#xD;
large room in the front part of the building to which&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
SQ&#xD;
S"rj&#xD;
&#xD;
FREEMAN's INDUSTRY.&#xD;
the yard was attached, in order to be properly trained,&#xD;
before the admission of customers. The men were&#xD;
arranged on one side of the room, the women on the&#xD;
other. The tallest was placed at'the head of the row,&#xD;
then the next tallest, and so on in the order of their&#xD;
respective heights. Emily was at the foot of the&#xD;
line of women. Freeman charged us to remem-&#xD;
ber our places; exhorted us to appear smart and live-&#xD;
ly, sometimes threatening, and again, holding out&#xD;
various inducements. During the day he exercised&#xD;
us in the art of "looking smart," and of moving to&#xD;
our places with exact precision.&#xD;
After being fed, in the afternoon, we were again&#xD;
paraded and made to dance. Bob, a colored boy,&#xD;
who had some time belonged to Freeman, played on&#xD;
the violin. Standing near hin, I made bold to in-&#xD;
quire if he could play the "Virginia Reel." He an-&#xD;
swered he could not, and asked me -fd I could play.&#xD;
Replying in the affirmative, he handed me the violin.&#xD;
I struck up a tune, and finished it. Freeman ordered&#xD;
me to continue playing, and seemed well pleased,&#xD;
telling Bob that I far excelled him-a remark that&#xD;
seemed to grieve my musical companion very much.&#xD;
Next day many customers called to examine Free-&#xD;
man's "new lot." The latter gentleman was very&#xD;
loquacious, dwelling at much length upon our several&#xD;
good points and qualities. He would make us hold&#xD;
up our heads, walk briskly back and forth, while cus-&#xD;
tomers would feel of our hands and arms and bodies,&#xD;
turn us about, ask us what we could do, make us open&#xD;

our mouths and show our teeth, precisely as a jockey&#xD;
examines a horse which he is about to barter for or&#xD;
purchase. Sometimes a man or woman was taken&#xD;
back to the small house in the yard, stripped, and in-&#xD;
spected more minutely. Scars upon a slave's back&#xD;
were considered 'evidence of a rebellious or unruly&#xD;
spirit, and hurt his sale.&#xD;
One old gentleman, who said he wanted a coach-&#xD;
man, appeared to take a faiicy to me. From his con-&#xD;
versation with Freeman, I learned he was a resident in&#xD;
the city. I very much desired that he would buy me.;&#xD;
because I conceived it would not be diflichilt to make&#xD;
my escape front New-Orleans on some northern vessel.&#xD;
Freeman asked him fifteen hundred dollars forIme.&#xD;
The old gentleman insisted it was too much, as times&#xD;
were very hard. Freeman, however, declared that I&#xD;
was sound and healthy, of a good constitution and&#xD;
intelligent. He made it a point to enlarge upon my&#xD;
musical attainments.  The old gentleman argued&#xD;
quite adroitly that there was nothing extraordinary&#xD;
about the nigger, and finally, to my regret, went out,&#xD;
saying lie would call again. During the day, how-&#xD;
ever, a.number of sales were made. David and Car-&#xD;
oline were purchased together by a Natchez planter.&#xD;
They left us, grinning broadly, and in the most happy&#xD;
state of mind, caused by the fact of their not being sep-&#xD;
arated. Lethe was sold to a planter of Baton Rouge,&#xD;
her eyes flashing with anger as she was led away.&#xD;
The same man also purchased Randall. The little&#xD;
fellow was made to jump, and run across the floor,&#xD;
&#xD;
PARTING OF RANDALL AND ELIZA.    81&#xD;
&#xD;
and perform many other feats, exhibiting his activity&#xD;
and condition. All the time the trade was going on,&#xD;
Eliza was crying aloud, and wringing lied hands. She&#xD;
besought the man not to buy him, unless lie also&#xD;
bought herself and Emily. She promised, in that case,&#xD;
to be the most faithful slave that ever lived.  The&#xD;
man answered that lie could not afford it, and then&#xD;
Eliza burst into a- paroxysm of grief, weeping plain-&#xD;
tively. Freeman turned round to her, savagely, with&#xD;
his whip in his uplifted hand, ordering her to stop her&#xD;
noise, or lie would flog her. He would not have such&#xD;
work -such snivelling ; and unless she ceased that&#xD;
minute, he would take her to the yard and give her a&#xD;
hundred lashes. Yes,lie-would take the nonsense out&#xD;
of her pretty quick-if he didn't, might he be d-d.&#xD;
Eliza shrunk before him, and tried to wipe away her&#xD;
tears, but it was all in vain. She wanted to be with,&#xD;
her children, she said, the little time she had to live.&#xD;
All the frowns and threats of Freeman, could not&#xD;
wholly silence the afflicted mother. She kept on beg=&#xD;
ging and beseeching them, most piteously, not to sep-&#xD;
arate the three. Over and over again she told them&#xD;
how she loved her boy. A great -many times she&#xD;
repeated her former promises - how very faithful and&#xD;
obedient she would be; how hard she would labor&#xD;
day and night, to the last moment of her life, if he&#xD;
would only buy them all together. But it was of no&#xD;
avail; the mian could not afford it. The bargain was&#xD;
agreed upon, and Randall must go alone. Then Eli-&#xD;
z ran to him; embraced him passionately; kissed&#xD;

&#xD;
him again and again; told him to remember her-.&#xD;
all the while her tears falling in the boy's face like rain.&#xD;
Freeman ,damned her, calling her a blubbering,&#xD;
bawling wench, and ordered her to go to her place,&#xD;
and behave herself, and be somebody. He swore he&#xD;
wouldn't stand such stuff but a little longer. lie&#xD;
would soon give her something to cry about, if she&#xD;
was not mighty careful, and that she might depend&#xD;
upon.&#xD;
The planter from Baton Rouge, with his new pur-&#xD;
chases, was ready to depart.&#xD;
"Don't cry, mama. I will be a good boy. Don't&#xD;
cry," said Randall, looking back, as they passed out&#xD;
of the door.&#xD;
What has become of the lad, God knows. It was&#xD;
a mournful scene indeed. I would have cried myself&#xD;
if I had dared.&#xD;
That night, nearly all who came in on the brig Or-&#xD;
leans, were taken ill. They complained of violent&#xD;
pain in the head and back. Little Emily -a thing&#xD;
unusual with her-- cried constantly. In the morn-&#xD;
ing a physician was called in; but was unable to de-&#xD;
termine the nature of our complaint. While examin-&#xD;
ing me, and asking questions touching my symptoms,&#xD;
I gave it as my opinion that it was an attack of small-&#xD;
pox -mentioning the fact of Robert's death as the&#xD;
reason of my belief. It might be so indeed; he thought,&#xD;
and he would send for the head physician of the hos-&#xD;
pital. Shortly, the head physician came-a small,&#xD;
light-haired man, whom they called Dr. Carr. He&#xD;
&#xD;
pronounced it small-pox, whereupon there was much&#xD;
alarm throughout the yard. Soon after Dr. Carr left,&#xD;
Eliza, Eminy, Harry and myself were put into a hack&#xD;
and driven to the hospital- a large white marble&#xD;
building, standing on the outskirts of the city. Har-&#xD;
ry and I were placed in a room in one of the upper&#xD;
stories. I became very sick. For three days I was&#xD;
entirely blind. While lying in this state one day,&#xD;
Bob came in, saying to Dr. Carr that Freeman had&#xD;
sent him over to inquire how we were getting on.&#xD;
Tell him, said the doctor, that Platt is very bad, but&#xD;
that if he survives until nine o'clock, he may recover.&#xD;
I expected to die. Though there was little in the&#xD;
prospect befoi-e me worth living for, the near approach&#xD;
of death appalled me. I thought I could have been&#xD;
resigned to yield up my life in the bosom of my family,&#xD;
but to' expire in the midst of strangers, under such&#xD;
circumstances, was a bitter reflection.&#xD;
There were a- great number in the hospital, of both&#xD;
sexes, and of all ages. In the rear of the building&#xD;
cofuins were manufactured. When one died, the bell&#xD;
tolled - a signal to the undertaker to come and bear&#xD;
away the body to the potter's field. Many times, each&#xD;
day and night, the tolling bell sent forth its melan-&#xD;
choly voice, announcing another death. But my time&#xD;
had not yet come. The crisis'having passed, I began to&#xD;
revive, and at the end of two weeks and two days,&#xD;
returned with Harry to the pen, bearing upon my&#xD;
face the effects of the malady, which to this day con-&#xD;
tinues to disfigure it. Eliza.and Emily were also&#xD;

&#xD;
brought back next day in a hack, .and again were we&#xD;
paraded in the sales-room, for the inspection and ex-&#xD;
amination of purchasers. I still indulged the hope&#xD;
that the old gentleman in search of a coachman would&#xD;
call again, as he had promised, and purchase me. In&#xD;
that event I felt an abiding confidence that I would&#xD;
soon regain my liberty. Customer after customer&#xD;
entered, but the old gentleman never made his a-&#xD;
pearance.&#xD;
At length, one day, while we were in the yard,&#xD;
Freeman came out and ordered us to our places, in&#xD;
the great room. A gentleman was waiting for us as&#xD;
we entered, and inasmuch as he will be often men-&#xD;
tioned in the progress of this narrative, a description&#xD;
of his personal appearance, and my estimation of his&#xD;
character, at first sight, may not be out of place.&#xD;
le was a man above the. ordinary height, some-&#xD;
what bent and stooping forward, lie was a good-&#xD;
looking man, and appeared to have reached about the&#xD;
middle age of life. There was nothing repulsive ine&#xD;
his presence; but; on the other hand, there was some-&#xD;
thing cheerful and attractive in his face, and in his&#xD;
tone of voice. The finer elements were all kindly&#xD;
mingled in his breast, as any one could see. He&#xD;
moved about among us, asking many questions, as to&#xD;
what we could do, and what labor we had been ac-&#xD;
customed to ; if we thought we would like to live&#xD;
with him, and would be good boys if he would buy&#xD;
us, and other interrogatories of like character.-&#xD;
After oine further inspection, and conversation&#xD;
&#xD;
touching prices, he finally offered-"Freeman one thou-&#xD;
sand dollars for me, nine hundred for Harry, and sev-&#xD;
en hundred for Eliza. Whether the small-pox had&#xD;
depreciated our value, or from what cause Freenian&#xD;
had concluded to fall five hundred dollars from the&#xD;
price I was before held at, I cannot say. At any rate,&#xD;
after a little shrewd reflection, he announced his ac--&#xD;
ceptance'of the offer.&#xD;
As soon as Eliza heard it, she was in an agony,&#xD;
again. By this time she had become haggard and&#xD;
hollow-eyed with sickness and with sorrow. It would&#xD;
be a relief if I could consistently pass over in silence&#xD;
the scene that now ensued. It recalls memories more&#xD;
mournful and affecting than any language can por-&#xD;
tray. I have seen mothers kissing for the last time&#xD;
the faces of their dead offspring ; I have seen them&#xD;
looking down into the grave, as the earth fell with a&#xD;
dull sound upon their coffins, hiding them from their&#xD;
eyes forever; but never have I seen such. an exhibi-&#xD;
tion of intense, unmeasured, and unbounded grief, as&#xD;
when Eliza was parted from her child. She broke&#xD;
from her place in the line of women, and rushing down&#xD;
where Emily was standing, caught her in her' arms.&#xD;
The child, sensible of some impending danger, instinct-&#xD;
ively fastened her hands around her mother's neck,&#xD;
and nestled her little head upon her bosom. Free-&#xD;
man sternly ordered her to, be quiet, but she did not&#xD;
heed him. lie caught her by the arm and pulled her&#xD;
rudely, but she only clung the closer to the dhild.&#xD;
Then, with a volley of great oaths, he struck her such&#xD;

a heartless blow, that she staggered backward, and&#xD;
was like to fall.; Oh! how piteously then did she be-&#xD;
seech and beg and pray that they might not be sepa-&#xD;
rated. Why could they not be purchased together?&#xD;
why not let her have one of her dear children?&#xD;
" Mercy, mercy, master ! " she cried, falling on her&#xD;
knees.  "Please, master, buy Emily. I can never&#xD;
work any if she is taken from me : I will die. "&#xD;
Freeman 'interfered again, but, disregarding him,&#xD;
she still plead most earnestly, telling how Randall had&#xD;
been taken from her -how she never would sec him&#xD;
again, and now it was too bad-oh, God! it was too&#xD;
bad, too cruel, to take her away from Emily-her&#xD;
pride -her only darling, that could not live, it was&#xD;
so young, without its mother !&#xD;
Finally, after much more of supplication, the pur-&#xD;
chaser of Eliza stepped forward, evidently affected,&#xD;
and said to Freeman he would buy Emily, and asked&#xD;
him what her price was.&#xD;
What is her price? Buy her ?" was the respond~&#xD;
sive interrogatory of Theophilus Freeman. And in-&#xD;
stantly answering his own inquiry, he added, "I won't&#xD;
sell her. She's not for sale.&#xD;
The man remarked he was not in need of one so&#xD;
young- that it would .be of no profit to him, but&#xD;
since the mother was so fond of her, rather than see&#xD;
them separated, i would pay a reasonable price.&#xD;
But to this humane proposal Freeman was entirely&#xD;
deaf. le would not sell her then on any account&#xD;
whatever. There were heaps and piles of money to&#xD;
&#xD;
riEEMAN REFUSES TO SELL EMILY.       87&#xD;
&#xD;
be made of her, lie said, when she was a few years&#xD;
older. There were men enough in New-Orleans who&#xD;
would give five thousand dollars for such an extra,&#xD;
handsome, fancy piece as Emily would be, rather than&#xD;
not get her. No, no, lie wou.d not sell her then.&#xD;
She was a beauty - a picture -a doll-- one of the&#xD;
regular bloods -none of your thick-lipped, bullet-&#xD;
headed, cotton-picking niggers -if she was might he&#xD;
be d-d.&#xD;
When Eliza heard Freeman's determination not to&#xD;
part with Emily, she became absolutely frantic.&#xD;
"I will not go without her. They shall not take&#xD;
her from me," she fairly shrieked, her shrieks com-&#xD;
mingling with the loud and angry voice of Freeman,&#xD;
commanding her to be silent.&#xD;
Meantime harry and myself had been to the yard&#xD;
aid returned with Our blankets, and were at the front&#xD;
door ready to leave. Our purchaser stood near us,&#xD;
gazing at Eliza with an expression indicative of re-&#xD;
ret at having bought her at the expense of so much&#xD;
sorrow. We waited some time, when, finally, Free-&#xD;
man, out of patience, tore Emily from her mother by&#xD;
main force, the two clinging to each. other with all&#xD;
their might.&#xD;
"Don't leave me, mama - don't leave me," scream-&#xD;
ed the child, as its mother was pushed harshly for-&#xD;
ward ; "Don't leave me-come back, mama," she still&#xD;
cried, stretching forth her little arms imploringly.&#xD;
But she cried in vain. Out of the door and into the&#xD;
street we were quickly-hurried. Still we could hear&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
her calling to her mother, " Come back-don't leave&#xD;
me - come back, mama," until her infant voice grew&#xD;
faint and still more faint, and gradually died away,&#xD;
as distance intervened, and finally was wholly lost.&#xD;
Eliza never after saw or heard of Emily or Randall.&#xD;
Day nor night, however, were they ever absent from&#xD;
her memory. In the cotton field, in the cabin, al-&#xD;
ways and everywhere, she was talking of them-often&#xD;
to them, as if they were actually present.  Only&#xD;
when absorbed in that illusion, or asleep, did she ever&#xD;
have a moment's comfort afterwards.&#xD;
She was no common slave, as has been said. To a&#xD;
large share of natural intelligence which she possess-&#xD;
ed, was added a general knowledge and information&#xD;
on most subjects. She had enjoyed opportunities such&#xD;
as are afforded to very few of her oppressed class.&#xD;
She had been lifted up into the regions of a higher&#xD;
life. Freedoni--freedom for herself and for her off-&#xD;
spring, for many years had been her cloud by day,&#xD;
her pillar of fire by night. In her pilgrimage through&#xD;
the wilderness of bondage, with eyes fixed upon that&#xD;
hope-inspiring beacon, shQ had at length ascended to&#xD;
" the top of Pisgah," and beheld " the land of prom-&#xD;
ise." In an unexpected moment she was utterly over-&#xD;
whelmed with disappointment and despair. The glo-&#xD;
rious vision of liberty faded from her sight as they led&#xD;
her away into captivity. Now "she weepeth sore in&#xD;
the night, and tears are on her cheeks : all her friends&#xD;
have dealt treacherously with her: they have become&#xD;
her enemies."&#xD;

I followed our new   master through the streets, while&#xD;
Eliza, crying and turning back, was forced along by&#xD;
Freeman and his minions, until we found ourselves on&#xD;
board the steamboat Rodolph, then lying at the levee.&#xD;
In the course of half an hour we were moving briskly&#xD;
up the Mississippi, bound for some point on Red Riv-&#xD;
er. There were quite a number of slaves on board&#xD;
beside ourselves, just purchased in the New-Orleans&#xD;
market.    I remember a Mr. Kelsow, who was said to&#xD;
be a, well known and extensive planter, had in charge&#xD;
a gang of women.&#xD;
Our master's name was William Ford. lHe resided&#xD;
then in the "Great Pine Woods," in the parish of'&#xD;
Avoyelles, situated on the right bank of Red River,&#xD;
&#xD;

in the heart of Louisiana. Ie is now a    artist&#xD;
preacher. Throughout the whole parish of Avoyelles,&#xD;
and especially along both shores o f l ayduBuf&#xD;
where he is more intimately known, he is accounted&#xD;
by his fellow-citizens as a worthy minister of God.&#xD;
In many northern minds, perhaps, the idea of a man&#xD;
holding his brother man in servitude, and the traffic&#xD;
in human flesh, may seem altogether incompatible&#xD;
with their conception ofsam oral or religious life.&#xD;
From descriptions of such men as Burch and Freeman,&#xD;
mentioned, they are led to de-&#xD;
spise and execrate the whole class f&#xD;
. ~ ~     ~     ~     o ..eeaso-slaveholdersim-&#xD;
discriminately. But I was sometime his slave, and&#xD;
had an opportulnit of 1e.z.&#xD;
y of leaning well his character and&#xD;
disposition, and it is but simple justi e to him when 1&#xD;
say, in my opinion, there never was a more kid, no-&#xD;
ble, candid, Christian   thl   ilam  Ford. The&#xD;
influences and associations that had always surround-&#xD;
edhim, blinded him to the inherent wr zong at the bot-&#xD;
tom of the system of Slaver.Ient out the&#xD;
morl rgh ofon          e never doubted the&#xD;
moral right of one man holding another i subjection.&#xD;
Looking through the same medium with his fathers&#xD;
beorer lhumle saw things in the same light. Brought&#xD;
p under other circumstances and other influences,&#xD;
his notions would undoubtedly have been different.&#xD;
Nevertheless, he was a model master, walking up-&#xD;
rightly, according to the light of his understanding,&#xD;
and fortunate was the slave who camersta&#xD;

our passage I was constantly reflecting on my sit-&#xD;
.a~on, and conStin with myself on the best course&#xD;
to pursue in order to effect my ultimate escape.&#xD;
Sometimes, not only then, but afterwards, I was al-&#xD;
most on the point of disclosing fully to Ford the facts&#xD;
of myhist    I am inclined now to the opinion it&#xD;

often considered, but through fear of its miscarriage,&#xD;
never put into execution, until eventually my transfer&#xD;
and his pecuniary embarrassments rendered it evi-&#xD;
dently unsafe. Afterwards, under other masters,.un-&#xD;
like William Ford, I knew well enough the slightest&#xD;
knowledge of my real character would consign me at&#xD;
once to' the remoter depths of Slavery. I was too&#xD;
costly a chattel to be lost, and was well aware that I&#xD;
would be taken farther on, into some by-place, over&#xD;
the Texan border, perhaps, and sold; that I would be&#xD;
disposed of as the thief disposes of his stolen horse, if&#xD;
my right. to freedom was even whispered. So I re-&#xD;
solved to lock the secret closely in my heart -never&#xD;
to utter one word or syllable as to who or what I was&#xD;

ARRIVAL AT ALEXANDRIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
trusting in Providence and my own shrewdness for&#xD;
deliverance.&#xD;
At length we left the steamboat Rodolph at a place&#xD;
called Alexandria, several hundred miles froi New-&#xD;
Orleans. It is a small town on the southern shore&#xD;
of Red River. Having remained there over night,&#xD;
we entered the morning train of cars, and were soon&#xD;
at Bayou Lamourie, a still smaller place, distant&#xD;
eighteen miles from Alexandria. At that time it was&#xD;
the termination of the railroad. Ford's plantation&#xD;
was situated on the Texas road, twelve miles from&#xD;
Lamourie, in the Great Pine Woods. This distance, it&#xD;
was announced to us, must be traveled on foot, there&#xD;
being public conveyances no farther. Accordingly&#xD;
we all set out in the company of Ford. It was an ex-&#xD;
cessively hot day. Harry, Eliza, and myself were yet&#xD;
weak, and the bottoms of our feet were very tender&#xD;
from the effects of the small-pox. We proceeded&#xD;
slowly, Ford telling us to take our time and sit down&#xD;
and rest whenever we desired-a privilege that was&#xD;
taken advantage of quite frequently. After leaving&#xD;
Lamourie and crossing two plantations, one belong-&#xD;
ing to Mr. Carnell, the other to a Mr. Flint, we reach-&#xD;
ed the Pine Woods, a wilderness that.stretches to the&#xD;
Sabine River.&#xD;
The whole country about Red River is low and&#xD;
- marshy. The Pine Woods, as they are called, is com-&#xD;
paratively upland, with frequent small intervals, how-&#xD;
ever, running through them. This upland is covered&#xD;
with numerous trees-the white oak, the chincopin,&#xD;
&#xD;
resembling~chestnut, but principally the yellow pine.&#xD;
They are of great size, running up sixty feet, and per-&#xD;
fectly straight. The woods were full of cattle, very.&#xD;
shy and. wild, dashing away in herds, with a loud&#xD;
snuff, at our approach. Some of them were marked&#xD;
or branded, the rest appeared to be in their wild and&#xD;
untamed state. They are much smaller than northern&#xD;
breeds, and the peculiarity about them that most at-&#xD;
tracted my attention was their horns. They stand&#xD;
out from the sides of the head precisely straight, like&#xD;
two iron spikes.&#xD;
At noon we reached a cleared piece of ground con-&#xD;
taining three or four acres. Upon it was a small, un-&#xD;
painted, wooden house, a corn crib, or, as we would&#xD;
say, a barn, and a log kitchen, standing about a rod&#xD;
from the house. It was the summer residence of Mr.&#xD;
Martin. Rich planters, having large establishments&#xD;
on Bayou Bouf, are accustomed to spend the warmer&#xD;
season in these .woods. Here they find clear water&#xD;
and delightful shades. In fact, these retreats are to&#xD;
the planters of that section of the country what New-&#xD;
port and Saratoga are to the wealthier inhabitants of&#xD;
northern cities-.&#xD;
We were sent around into the kitchen, and supplied&#xD;
with sweet potatoes, corn-bread, and bacon, while&#xD;
Master Ford dined with Martin in the house. There&#xD;
were several slaves about the premises.. Martin came&#xD;
out and took a look at us, asking Ford the price of&#xD;
each, if we were green hands, and so forth, and making&#xD;
inquiries in relation to the slave market generally&#xD;

TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
After a long rest we set forth again, following tLo&#xD;
Texas road, which had the appearance of being very&#xD;
rarely traveled. For five miles we passed through&#xD;
continuous woods without observing a single habita-&#xD;
tion. At length, just as the sun was sinking in the&#xD;
west, we entered another opening, containing some&#xD;
twelve or fifteen acres.&#xD;
In this opening stood a house much larger than Mr.&#xD;
Martin's. It was two stories high, with a piazza in&#xD;
front. In the rear of it was also a log kitchen, poul-&#xD;
try house, corneribs, and several negro cabins. Near&#xD;
the house was a peach orchard, and gardens of orange&#xD;
and pomegranate trees. The space was entirely sur-&#xD;
rounded by woods, and covered with a carpet of rich,&#xD;
rank verdure. It was a quiet, lonely, pleasant place&#xD;
--literally a green spot in the wilderness. It was the&#xD;
residence of my master, William Ford.&#xD;
As we approached, a yellow girl-her name was&#xD;
Rose - was standing on the piazza. Going to the&#xD;
door, she called her mistress, who presently came run-&#xD;
ning out to meet her lord. She kissed him, and&#xD;
laughingly demanded if he had bought "those ni.._&#xD;
gers." Ford said lie had, and told usto go round to&#xD;
Sally's cabin and rest ourselves. Turning the corner&#xD;
of the house, we discovered Sally washing -her two&#xD;
baby children near her, rolling on the grass. They&#xD;
jumped up and toddled towards us, looked at us a&#xD;
moment like a brace of rabbits, then ran back to their&#xD;
mother as if afraid of us._&#xD;
Sally conducted us into the cabin, told us to lay down&#xD;
&#xD;

our bundles and be seated, for she was sure that we were&#xD;
tired. Just then John, the cook, a boy some sixteen&#xD;
years of age, and blacker than any crow, came run-&#xD;
ning in, looked steadily in our faces, then turning&#xD;
round, without saying as much as "how d'ye, do,"&#xD;
ran back to the kitchen, laughing loudly,-as if our&#xD;
coming was a great joke indeed.&#xD;
Much wearied, with our walk, as soon as it was&#xD;
dark, Harry and I wrapped our blankets round us,&#xD;
and laid down upon the cabin floor. My thoughts,&#xD;
as usual, wandered back t9 my wife and. children.&#xD;
The consciousness of my real situation ; the hopeless-&#xD;
ness of any effort to escape through the wide forests&#xD;
of Avoyelles, pressed heavily upon me, yet my heart&#xD;
was at home in Saratoga.&#xD;
I was awakened early in the morning by the voice&#xD;
of Master Ford, calling Rose. She hastened into the&#xD;
house to dress the children, Sally to the field to milk&#xD;
the cows, while John was busy in the kitchen prepar-&#xD;
ing breakfast. In the meantime Harry and I were&#xD;
strolling about the yard, looking at our new quarters.&#xD;
Just after breakfast a colored man, driving three -yoke&#xD;
of oxen, attached to a wagon load of lumber, drove&#xD;
into the opening. ie was a slave of Ford's, named&#xD;
Walton, the husband of Rose. By the way, Rose was&#xD;
a native of Washington, and had been brought from&#xD;
thence five years before. She had never seen'Eliza,&#xD;
but she had heard of Berry, and they knew the same&#xD;
streets, and the same people, either personally, or by&#xD;
reputation. They became fast friends immediately,&#xD;

SABXII DAYS.                   97&#xD;
&#xD;
and talked a great deal together of old times, and of&#xD;
friends 'they had left behind.&#xD;
Ford was at that time a wealthy man. Besides his&#xD;
seat in the Pine Woods, he owned a large lumberingo&#xD;
establishment on Indian Creek, four miles distant, and&#xD;
also, in his wife's right, an. extensive plantation and&#xD;
many slaves on Bayou Bouf..&#xD;
Walton had come with his load of lumber from the&#xD;
mills on Indian Creek. Ford'directed us to return&#xD;
with him, saying he would follow us as soon as possible.&#xD;
Before leaving, Mistress Ford called me into the store-&#xD;
room, and handed me, as it is there termed, a tin&#xD;
bucket of molasses for Harry and myself.&#xD;
Eliza was still ringing her hands and deploring the&#xD;
loss of her children. Ford tried as much as possible&#xD;
to console her --told her she need not work very hard;&#xD;
that she might remain with Rose, and assist the mad-&#xD;
am in the house affairs.-&#xD;
Riding with Walton in the wagon, Harry and I be-&#xD;
came quite well acquainted with him long before&#xD;
reaching Indian Creek. He was a "born thrall" of&#xD;
Ford's, and spoke kindly and affectionately of him, as&#xD;
a child would speak of his own father. In answer to&#xD;
his inquiries from whence I came, I told him from&#xD;
Washington. Of that city, lie had heard much from&#xD;
his wife,. Rose, and all the way plied me with many&#xD;
extravagant and absurd questions.  V&#xD;
On reaching the mills at Indian Creek, we found&#xD;
two more of Ford's slaves, Sam and Antony., Sam,&#xD;
also, was a Washingtonian, having been brought out&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
It&#xD;
&#xD;
ia the same gang with Rose. He had worked on a&#xD;
farm near Georgetown. Antony was a blacksmith,&#xD;
from Kentucky, who had been in his. present master's&#xD;
service about ten years. Sam knew Burch, and when&#xD;
informed that he was the trader who had sent me on&#xD;
from Washington, it was remarkable how well we&#xD;
agreed upon the subject of his superlative rascality.&#xD;
lie had forwarded Sam, also.&#xD;
On Ford's arrival at the mill, we were employed in&#xD;
piling lumber, and chopping logs, which occupation&#xD;
we continued during the remainder of the summer.&#xD;
We usually spent our Sabbaths at the opening, on&#xD;
which days our master would gather all his slaves&#xD;
about him, and read and expound the Scriptures.&#xD;
Te sought to inculcate in our minds feelings of kind-&#xD;
ness towards each other, of dependence upon God--&#xD;
setting forth the rewards promised unto those who&#xD;
lead an upright and prayerful life. Seated in the&#xD;
doorway of his house, surrounded by his man-ser-&#xD;
vants and his maid-servants, who looked earnestly into&#xD;
the good man's face, he spoke of the loving kindness&#xD;
of the Creator, and of the life that is to come. Often&#xD;
did the voice of prayer ascend from his lips to heaven,.&#xD;
the only sound that broke the solitude of the place.&#xD;
In the course of the summer Sam became deeply&#xD;
convicted, his mind dwelling intensely on the subject&#xD;
of religion. His mistress gave him a Bible, which&#xD;
he carried with him to his work. Whatever leisure&#xD;
time was allowed him, he spent in perusing it, though&#xD;
it was only with great'difficulty that he could master&#xD;

any part of it. I often read to him, a favor which he&#xD;
well repaid me by many expressions of gratitude.&#xD;
Sam's piety was frequently observed by white men&#xD;
who came-to the mill, and the remark it most genei'-&#xD;
ally provoked was, that a man like Ford, who allowed&#xD;
his slaves to have Bibles, was "not fit to own a nigger."&#xD;
He, however, lost nothing by his kindness. It is&#xD;
a fact I have more than once observed, that those who&#xD;
treated their slaves most leniently, were rewarded by&#xD;
the greatest amount of labor. I know it from my&#xD;
own experience. It was a source of pleasure to sur-&#xD;
prise Master Ford with a greater day's work than was&#xD;
required, while, under subsequent masters, there was&#xD;
no prompter to extra effort but the overseer's lash.&#xD;
It was the desire of Ford's approving voice that&#xD;
suggested to me an idea that resulted to his profit.&#xD;
The lumber we were manufacturing was contracted&#xD;
to be delivered at Lamourie. It had hitherto been&#xD;
transported by land, and was an important item of&#xD;
expense. Indian Creek, upon which the mills were&#xD;
situated, was a narrow but deep stream emptying into&#xD;
Bayou Boeuf. In some places it was not more than&#xD;
twelve feet wide, and much obstructed with trunks of&#xD;
trees. Bayou Boeuf was connected with Bayou Lamoui-&#xD;
rie. I ascertained the distance from the mills to the&#xD;
point on the latter bayou, where our lumber was to be&#xD;
delivered, was but a few miles less by land than by&#xD;
water. Provided the creek could be made navigaAle&#xD;
for rafts, it occurred to me that the expense of trans.&#xD;
portation would be materially diminished.&#xD;
&#xD;
ADAM TAYDEl.&#xD;
Ada  Tader, little white man, who had been a&#xD;
Adam Taydemer in Forida, and had strolled into that distant&#xD;
region, was foreman and superintendent of the mills.&#xD;
Ie, scouted the idea; but Ford, when I laid it before&#xD;
him, received it favorably, and permitted me to try&#xD;
the experillient.&#xD;
having removed the obstructions, I made up a nar-&#xD;
row raft, consisting of twelve cribs. At this business&#xD;
I think I wcas quite skillful, not having forgotten my&#xD;
experience ears before on the Champlain canal. I&#xD;
labored hard, being extremely anxious to succeed,&#xD;
both from a desire to please my master, and to show&#xD;
Aedam Taydem that my scheme was not such aed vis-On&#xD;
ionary one as he incessantly pronounced it. One&#xD;
hand could manage three cribs. I took chargedownof the&#xD;
forward three, and commenced   ofirsg bayou,and&#xD;
creek. In due time ed our destination in' a shorter period&#xD;
of time than I had anticipated.&#xD;
The arrival of the raft at Lamourie created a sen-&#xD;
sation, while Mr. Ford loaded me with commenda-&#xD;
stions. On all sides I heard Ford's Platt pronounced&#xD;
the "smartest nigger in theC ine Woods"  insfact&#xD;
I was the Fulton of Indian Creek. I was not insen-.&#xD;
Bible. to the praise bestowed upon me, and enjoyed,&#xD;
especially, my triumph over Taydem, whose half-&#xD;
malicious ridicule had stung my pride. From this&#xD;
time the entire control of bringing the lumber to&#xD;
Lamourie was placed in my hands until the contract&#xD;
was fulfilled.&#xD;

100          TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Indian Creek, in its whole length, flows through a&#xD;
magnificent forest. There dwells on its shore a tribe&#xD;
of Indians, a remnant of the Chickasaws or Chick-&#xD;
opees, if I remember rightly. They live in simple&#xD;
huts, ten or twelve feet square, constructed of pine&#xD;
poles and covered with bark. They subsist princi-&#xD;
pally on the flesh of the deer, the coon, and opos-&#xD;
sum, all of which are plenty in these woods.. Some-&#xD;
times they exchange venison for a little corn and&#xD;
whisky with the planters on the bayous. Their&#xD;
usual dress is buckskin breeches and calico hunting&#xD;
shirts of fantastic colors, buttoned from belt to chin.&#xD;
They wear brass rings on their wrists, and in their&#xD;
ears and noses. The dress of the squaws is very&#xD;
similar. They are fond of dogs and horses - owning&#xD;
many of the latter, of a small, tough breed--and&#xD;
are skillful riders. Their bridles, girths and saddles&#xD;
were made of raw skins of animals; their stirrups'&#xD;
of a certain kind of wood. Mounted astride their&#xD;
ponies, men and women, I have seen them dash out&#xD;
into the woods at the utmost of their speed, following&#xD;
narrow winding paths, and dodging trees, in a man-&#xD;
ner that eclipsed the most miraculous feats of civil-&#xD;
ized equestrianism. Circling away in various direc-&#xD;
tions, the forest echoing and re-echoing with their&#xD;
whoops, they would presently return at the same&#xD;
dashing, headlong speed with which they started.&#xD;
Their village was on Indian Creek, known as Indiaa&#xD;
Castle, but their range extended to the Sabine River.&#xD;
Occasionally a tribe from Texas would come over on&#xD;
&#xD;
101&#xD;
&#xD;
CASCALLA AND HIS TRIBE.&#xD;
&#xD;
a visit, and then there was indeed a. carnival in the&#xD;
"Great Pine Woods." Chief of the tribe was Cas-&#xD;
calla; second in rank, John Baltese, his son-in-law;&#xD;
with both of whom, as with many others of the tribe,&#xD;
I became acquainted during my frequent voyages&#xD;
down the creek with rafts. Sam and myself would&#xD;
often visit them when the day's task was done. They&#xD;
were obedient to the chief; the word of Casealla&#xD;
was their law. They were a rude but harmless peo-&#xD;
ple, and enjoyed their wild mode of life. They had&#xD;
little fancy for the open country, the cleared lands&#xD;
on the shores of the bayous, but preferred to hide&#xD;
themselves within the shadows of the forest. They&#xD;
worshiped the Great Spirit, loved whisky, and were&#xD;
happy.&#xD;
On one occasion I was present. at a dance, when&#xD;
a roving herd from Texas had encamped in their&#xD;
village. The entire carcass of a deer was roasting&#xD;
before a large fire, which threw its light a long dis-&#xD;
tance among the trees under which they were assem-&#xD;
bled. When they had formed in a ring, men and&#xD;
squaws alternately, a sort of=Indian fiddle set up an&#xD;
indescribable tune. It was a continuous, melancholy&#xD;
kind of wavy sound, with the slightest possible vari-&#xD;
ation. At the first note, if indeed there was more&#xD;
than one note in the whole tune, they circled around,&#xD;
trotting after .each other, and giving utterance to a&#xD;
guttural, sing-song noise, equally as nondescript as the&#xD;
music of the fiddle. At the end of the third circuit,&#xD;
they would stop suddenly, whoop as if their lungs&#xD;

would crack, then break from the ring, forming in&#xD;
couples, man and squaw, each jumping backwards as&#xD;
far aspossible from the other, then forwards -which&#xD;
graceful feat having been twice or thrice accomplish-&#xD;
ed, they would form in a ring, and go trotting round&#xD;
again. The best dancer appeared to be considered&#xD;
the one who could whoop the loudest, jump the far-&#xD;
thest, and utter the most excruciating noise. At in-&#xD;
tervals, one or more would leave the dancing circle,&#xD;
and going to the fire, cut from the roasting carcass a&#xD;
slice of venison.&#xD;
In a hole, shaped like a mortar, cut in the trunk&#xD;
of a fallen tree, they pounded corn with a wooden&#xD;
pestle, and of the meal made cake. Alternately they&#xD;
danced and ate. Thus were the visitors from Texas&#xD;
entertained by the dusky sons and daughters of the&#xD;
Chicopees, and such is a description, as I saw it, of&#xD;
an Indian ball in the Pine Woods .of Avoyelles.&#xD;
In the autumn, I left the mills, and was employed&#xD;
at the opening. One day the mistress was urging&#xD;
Ford to procure a loom, in order that: Sally might&#xD;
commence weaving cloth for the winter garments of&#xD;
the slaves. He could not imagine where one was to&#xD;
be found, when I suggested that the easiest way to&#xD;
get one would be to make it, informing him at the&#xD;
same time, that I was a sort of "Jack at all trades,"&#xD;
and would attempt it, with his permission. It was&#xD;
granted very readily, and I was allowed to go to a&#xD;
neighboring planter's to inspect one before commen-&#xD;
cing the undertaking. At length it was. finished&#xD;
&#xD;
JOHN M. TIBEATs.           103&#xD;
and pronounced by Sally to be perfect. She could&#xD;
easily weave her task. of fourteen yards, milk the&#xD;
cows, and have leisure time besides each day. It&#xD;
worked so well, I was continued in the employment&#xD;
of inaking looms, which were taken down to the&#xD;
plantation on the bayou.&#xD;
At this time one John M. Tibeats a carpenter, came&#xD;
to the opening to do some work on inaster's house.&#xD;
I was directed to quit the looms and assist him. For&#xD;
two weeks I was in his company, planing and match-&#xD;
ing boards for ceiling, a plastered room being a rare&#xD;
thing in the parish of Avoyelles.&#xD;
John M. Tibeats was the opposite of Ford in all&#xD;
respects. le 'was a small, crabbed, quick-tempered,&#xD;
spiteful man. He had no fixed residence that I ever&#xD;
heard of, but passed from one plantation to another,&#xD;
wherever he could find employment. He was with-&#xD;
out standing in the community, not esteemed by&#xD;
white men, nor even respected by slaves. He was&#xD;
ignorant, withal, and of a revengeful disposition. He&#xD;
left the parish long before I did, and I know not&#xD;
whether he is at present alive or dead. Certain it is,&#xD;
it was a most unlucky day for -me that brought us&#xD;
together. During my residence with Master Ford I&#xD;
had seen only the bright side of slavery. His was&#xD;
no heavy hand crushing us to the earth. lie pointed&#xD;
upwards, and with benign and cheering words ad-&#xD;
dressed us as his fellow-mortals, accountable, like&#xD;
himself, to the Maker of us all. I think of him with&#xD;
affection, and had my family been with me, could&#xD;

WILLIAM FORD unfortunately became embarrassed&#xD;
in his pecuniary affairs.   A heavy judgment was ren-&#xD;
dered against him in consequence of his having be-&#xD;
come security for his brother, Franklin Ford, residing&#xD;
on Red River, above Alexandria, and who had failed&#xD;
to mneet his iabilities.  He was also indebted to John&#xD;
M. Tibeats to a considerable amount in consideration&#xD;
of his services in building the mills on Indian Creek,&#xD;
and also a weaving-house, corn-mill and other erec-&#xD;
tions on the plantation at Bayou Boeuf, not yet com-&#xD;
pleted. It-was therefore necessary, in order to meet&#xD;
these demands, to dispose of eighteen slaves, myself&#xD;
among the number. . Seventeen of them, including&#xD;
Sam   and Harry, were purchased by Peter Compton,&#xD;
a planter also residing on Red River.&#xD;

TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
I was sold to Tibeats, in consequence, undoubtedly,&#xD;
of 1ry slight skill as a carpenter. This was in the&#xD;
winter of 1842. The deed of myself from Freeman&#xD;
to Ford, as I ascertained from the public records in&#xD;
New-Orleans on my return, was dated June 23d,&#xD;
1811. At the time of my sale to Tibeats, the price&#xD;
agreed to be given for me being more than the debt,&#xD;
Ford took a chattel mortgage of four hundred dollars.&#xD;
I am indebted for my life, as will hereafter be seen,&#xD;
to that mortgage.&#xD;
I bade farewell to my good friends at the opening,&#xD;
and departed with my new master Tibeats. We&#xD;
went down to the plantation on Bayou Bouf, distant&#xD;
twenty-seven miles from the Pine Woods, to complete&#xD;
the unfinished contract. Bayou Bocuf is a sluggish,&#xD;
winding stream-one of those stagnant bodies of&#xD;
water common in that region, setting back from Red&#xD;
River. It stretches from a point not far from Alex-&#xD;
andria, in a south-easterly direction, and following its&#xD;
tortuous course, is more than fifty miles in length.&#xD;
Large cotton and sugar plantations line each shore,&#xD;
extending back to the borders of interminable&#xD;
swamps. It is alive with alligators, rendering it un-&#xD;
safe for swine, or unthinking slave children to stroll&#xD;
along its banks. Upon a bend in this bayou, a short&#xD;
distance from Cheneyville, was situated the plantation&#xD;
of Madam Ford-her brother, Peter Tanner, a great&#xD;
landholder, living on the opposite side.&#xD;
On my arrival at Bayou Bceuf, I had the pleasure&#xD;
of meeting Eliza, whom I had not seen for several&#xD;
&#xD;
months. She'had not pleased Mrs. Ford, being more&#xD;
occupied in brooding over her sorrows than in attend-&#xD;
ing to her business, and had, in consequence, been sent&#xD;
down to work in the field on the plantation. She had&#xD;
grown feeble and emaciated, and was still mourning&#xD;
for her children. She asked me if I had forgotten&#xD;
them, and a great many times inquired if I still re-&#xD;
membered how handsome little Emily was -how&#xD;
much Randall loved her - and wondered if they were&#xD;
living still, and where the darlings could then be.&#xD;
She had sunk beneath the weight of an excessive grief.&#xD;
Her drooping form and hollow cheeks too plainly indi-&#xD;
cated that she had well nigh reached the end of her&#xD;
weary road.&#xD;
Ford's overseer on this plantation, and who had the&#xD;
exclusive charge of it, was a Mr. Chapin, a kindly-dis-&#xD;
posed man, and a native of Pennsylvania. In com-&#xD;
mon with others, he held Tibeats in light estimation,&#xD;
which fact, in connection with the four hundred dol-&#xD;
lar mortgage, was fortunate for me.&#xD;
I was now compelled to labor very hard. FrQm&#xD;
earliest dawn until late at iiiguht, I was not allowed to&#xD;
be a moment idle. Notwithstanding which, Tibeats&#xD;
was never satisfied. Ie was continually cursing and&#xD;
complaining. He never spoke to ne a kind word. I&#xD;
was his faithful slave, and earned him large wages&#xD;
every day, and yet I went to my cabin nightly, loaded&#xD;
with abuse and stinging epithets.&#xD;
We had completed the corn mill, the kitchen,, and&#xD;
so forth, and were at.work upon the weaving-house,&#xD;

TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
when I was guilty of an act, in that State punishable&#xD;
with death. It was my first, fight with Tibeats. The&#xD;
weaving-house we were erecting stood in the orchard&#xD;
a few rods from the residence of Chapin, or the "great&#xD;
house," as it was called. One night, having worked&#xD;
until it was too dark to see, I was ordered by Tibeats&#xD;
to rise very early in the morning, procure a keg of&#xD;
nails from Chapin, and commence putting on the&#xD;
clapboards. I retired to the cabin extremely tired,&#xD;
and having cooked a supper of bacon and corn cake,&#xD;
and conversed a while with Eliza, who occupied the&#xD;
same cabin, as also did Lawson and his wife Mary,&#xD;
and a slave named Bristol, laid down upon the ground&#xD;
floor, little dreaming of the sufferings that awaited me&#xD;
on the morrow. Before daylight I was on the piazza&#xD;
of the "great house," awaiting the appearance of over-&#xD;
seer Chapin. To have aroused him from his slumbers&#xD;
and stated my errand, would have been an unpardon-&#xD;
able boldness. At length he came out. Taking off'&#xD;
my hat, I informed him Master Tibeats had directed&#xD;
me to call upon him for a keg of nails. Going into&#xD;
the store-room, he rolled it out, at the same time say-&#xD;
ing, if Tibeats preferred a different size, he would en-&#xD;
deavor to furnish them, but that I might use those&#xD;
until further directed. Then mounting his horse,&#xD;
which stood saddled and bridled at the door, he rode&#xD;
away into the field, whither the slaves. had preceded&#xD;
him, while I took the keg on. my shoulder, and pro-&#xD;
ceeding to the weaving-house, broke in the head, and&#xD;
commericed nailing on the-clapboards.&#xD;

As. the day began to open, Tibeats came out of the&#xD;
house to where I was, hard at work. He seemed to&#xD;
be that morning even more morose and disagreeable&#xD;
than usual. He was my master, entitled by law to&#xD;
my flesh and blood, and to exercise over me such ty-&#xD;
rannical control as his mean nature prompted ; but&#xD;
there was 'no law that could prevent my looking upon&#xD;
him with intense contempt. I despised both his dis-&#xD;
position and his intellect. I had just come round to&#xD;
the keg for a further supply of nails, as he reached&#xD;
the weaving-house.&#xD;
"I thought I told you to commence putting oni&#xD;
weather-boards this morning," he remarked.&#xD;
" Yes, master, and I am about it," I replied.&#xD;
" Where ? " he demanded.&#xD;
"On the other side," was my answer.&#xD;
He walked round to the other side, examined my&#xD;
work for a while, muttering to himself in a fault-find-&#xD;
ing tone.&#xD;
"Didn't I tell you last night'to get a keg of nails&#xD;
of Chapin?" he broke forth again.&#xD;
" Yes, master, and so I did; and overseer said he&#xD;
would get another size for you, if you wanted them,&#xD;
when he came back from the field."&#xD;
Tibeats walked to the keg, looked a moment at the&#xD;
contents, then kicked it violently. Corning towards&#xD;
me in a great passion, he exclaimed,&#xD;
" G-d d-n you! I thought you knowed some-&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
I 'made answer: "I tried to do as you told me,&#xD;

:master. I didn't mean anything wrong. Overseer&#xD;
said--" But ie interrupted ine with such a flood- of&#xD;
curses that I was unable to finish the sentence. At&#xD;
length he ran towards the house, and going to the&#xD;
piazza, took down one of the overseer's whips. The&#xD;
whip had a short wooden stock, braided over with&#xD;
leather, and was loaded at the butt. The lash was&#xD;
three feet long, or thereabouts, and made of raw-hide&#xD;
strands.&#xD;
At first I was somewhat frightened, and my impulse&#xD;
was to run. There was no one about except Rachel,&#xD;
the cook, and Chapin's wife, and neither of them were&#xD;
to be seen. The rest were in the field. I knew he&#xD;
intended to whip me, and it was the first time any&#xD;
one had attempted it since my arrival at Avoyelles.&#xD;
I felt, moreover, that I had been faithful -that I was&#xD;
guilty of no wrong whatever, and deserved commenda-&#xD;
tion rather than punishment. My fear changed to&#xD;
anger, and before he reached me I had made up my&#xD;
mind fully not to be whipped, let the result be life or&#xD;
death.&#xD;
Winding the lash around his hand, and taking hold,&#xD;
of the small end of the stock, lie walked up to me,&#xD;
and with a malignant look, ordered me to strip.&#xD;
"Master Tibeats, said I, looking him boldly in the&#xD;
face, "I will not." I was about to say soinething-&#xD;
further in justification, but with concentrated ven&#xD;
geance, he sprang upon me, seizing me by the throat&#xD;
with one hand, raising the whip with the other, in the&#xD;
act of striking. Before the blow descended,. however,&#xD;
&#xD;
TIBEATS' DISCOMFITURE.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
I had caught him by the collar of the coat, and drawn&#xD;
him closely to me. Reaching down, I seized him by&#xD;
the ankle, and pushing him back with the other hand,&#xD;
he fell over on the ground. Putting one arm around&#xD;
his leg, and holding it to my breast, so that his head&#xD;
and shoulders only touched the ground, I placed my&#xD;
foot upon his neck. He was completely in my power.&#xD;
My blood was up. It seemed to course through my&#xD;
reins like fire. In the frenzy of my madness I snatched&#xD;
the whip from his hand. He struggled with all his&#xD;
power; swore that I should not live to, see another&#xD;
day ; and that he would tear out my heart. But his&#xD;
struggles and his threats were alike in vain. I cannot&#xD;
tell how many times I struck him. Blow after blow&#xD;
fell fast and heavy upon his wriggling form. At&#xD;
length he screamed- cried murder - and at last the&#xD;
blasphemous tyrant called on God for mercy. But&#xD;
he who had never shown mercy did not receive it.&#xD;
The stiff stock of the whip warped round his cringing&#xD;
body until my right arm ached.&#xD;
Until this time I had been too busy to look about&#xD;
me. Desisting for a moment, I saw Mrs. Chapin&#xD;
looking from the window, and Rachel standing in the&#xD;
kitchen door. Their attitudes expressed the utmost&#xD;
excitement and alarm. His screams had been heard&#xD;
in the field. Chapin was coming as fast as he could&#xD;
ride. I struck him a blow or two more, then pushed&#xD;
lim from me withsuch a well-directed kick that he&#xD;
went rolling over on the ground.&#xD;
Rising to his feet, and brushing the dirt from his&#xD;

hair, he stood looking at me, pale with rage. We&#xD;
gazed at each other in silence. Not a word was ut-&#xD;
tered until Chapin galloped up to us.&#xD;
"What is the matter ?" he cried out.&#xD;
"Master Tibeats wants to whip me for using the&#xD;
nails you gave me," I replied.&#xD;
What is the matter with the nails ?" he inquired,&#xD;
turning to Tibeats.&#xD;
Tibeats answered to the effect that they were too&#xD;
large, paying little heed, however, to Chapin's ques-&#xD;
tion, but still keeping his snakish eyes fastened mali-&#xD;
ciously on me.&#xD;
"I am overseer here," Chapin began. "I told&#xD;
Platt to take them and use them, and if. they were not&#xD;
of the-proper size I would get others on returning from&#xD;
the field. It is not his fault. Besides, I shall furnish&#xD;
such nails as I please. I hope you will understand&#xD;
that, Mr. Tibeats."&#xD;
Tibeats made no reply, but, grinding his teeth and&#xD;
shaking his fist, swore he would have satisfaction,&#xD;
and that it was not half over yet. Thereupon he walk-&#xD;
ed away, followed by the overseer, and entered the&#xD;
house, the latter talking to him all the while in a sup-&#xD;
pressed tone, and with earnest gestures.&#xD;
I remained where I was, doubting whether it was&#xD;
better to fly or abide the result, 'whatever it might&#xD;
be. Presently Tibeats came out of the house, and,&#xD;
saddling his horse, the only property he possessed be-&#xD;
sides myself ,departed on the road to Chenyville.&#xD;
When he was gone, Chapin came out, visibly exci-&#xD;
&#xD;
ted, telling- me not to stir, not to attempt to leave the&#xD;
plantation on any account whatever. He then went&#xD;
to the kitchen, and calling Rachel out, conversed with&#xD;
her some time. Coming back, he again charged me&#xD;
with great earnestness not to run, saying my master&#xD;
was a rascal ; that he had left on no good errand, and&#xD;
that there might be trouble before night. But at all&#xD;
events, he insisted upon it, I must not stir.&#xD;
As I stood there, feelings of unutterable agony&#xD;
overwhelmed me. I was conscious that I had sub-&#xD;
jected myself to unimaginable punishment. The re-&#xD;
action that followed my extreme ebullition of anger&#xD;
produced the most painful sensations of regret. An&#xD;
unfriended, helpless slave -what could I do, what&#xD;
could I say, to justify, in the remotest manner, the&#xD;
heinous act I had committed, of resenting a white&#xD;
man's contumely and abuse. I tried to pray- I tried&#xD;
to beseech my Heavenly Father to sustain me in my&#xD;
sore extremity, but emotion choked my utterance, and&#xD;
I could only bow my head upon my hands and weep.&#xD;
For at least an hour I remained in this situation, find-&#xD;
ing relief only in tears, when, looking up, I behead&#xD;
Tibeats, accompanied by two horsemen, coming down&#xD;
the bayou. They rode into the yard, jumped from&#xD;
their horses, and approached me with large whips,&#xD;
one of them also carrying a coil of rope.&#xD;
" Cross your hands," commanded Tibeats, with the&#xD;
addition of such a shuddering expression of blasphe-&#xD;
my as is not decorous to repeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="114" xml:id="VAC7339-00000060"/>&#xD;
114          TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
" You need not bind me, Master Tibeats, I am&#xD;
ready to go with you anywhere," said I.&#xD;
One of his companions then stepped forward, swear-&#xD;
ing if I made the least resistance lie would break my&#xD;
head -lie would tear me limb from limb -lie would&#xD;
cut my black throat - and giving wide scope to other&#xD;
similar expressions. Perceiving any importunity al-&#xD;
together vain, I crossed niy hands, submitting hum-&#xD;
bly to whatever disposition they might please to make&#xD;
of me. Thereupon Tibeats tied my wrists, drawing&#xD;
the rope around them with his-utmost strength. Then&#xD;
lie bound my ankles in the same manner. In the&#xD;
meantime the other two had slipped a cord within my&#xD;
elbows, running it across my back, and tying it firm-&#xD;
ly. It was utterly impossible to move hand or foot.&#xD;
With a remaining piece of rope Tibeats made an awk-&#xD;
wai-d noose, and placed it about my neck.&#xD;
" Now, then," inquired one of Tibeats' companions,&#xD;
" where shall we hang the nigger ?"&#xD;
One proposed such a limb, extending from the body&#xD;
of a poach tree, near the spot where we were stand-&#xD;
ing. His comrade objected to it, alleging it would&#xD;
break, and proposed another. Finally they fixed up-&#xD;
on the latter.&#xD;
During this conversation, and all the time they&#xD;
were bindIng me, I uttered not a. word. Overseer&#xD;
Chapin, during the progress of the scene, was walk-&#xD;
ing hastily back and forth on the piazza. Rachel wis&#xD;
crying by the kitchen door, and Mrs. Chapin was still&#xD;

cheeks, but they only afforded a subject of insulting&#xD;
comment for my executioners.&#xD;
At length, as they were dragging me towards the&#xD;
tree, Chapin, who had momentarily disappeared from&#xD;
the piazza, came out of the house, and walked towards&#xD;
us. He had a pistol in each hand, and as near as I&#xD;
can now recall to mind, spoke in a firm, determined&#xD;
manner, as follows:&#xD;
"Gentlemen, I have a few words to say. You had&#xD;
better listen to them. Whoever moves that slave an-&#xD;
other foot from where he stands is a dead' man. In&#xD;
the first place, he does not deserve this treatment. It&#xD;
is a shame to murder him in this manner. I never&#xD;
knew a more faithful boy than Platt. .You, Tibeats,&#xD;
are in the fault yourself. You are pretty much of a&#xD;
scoundrel, and I know it, and you richly deserve the&#xD;
flogging you have received. In the next place, I have&#xD;
been overseer on this plantation seven years, and, in&#xD;
the absence of William Ford, am master here. My&#xD;

perform. You are not responsible -you are a worth.&#xD;

Until that is canceled you have no right to take his&#xD;
life. You have no right to take it any way. There&#xD;
is a law for the slave as well as for the white man.&#xD;
You are no better than a murderer.&#xD;
"As for you," addressing Cook and Ramsay, a&#xD;
couple of overseers from neighboring plantations, "as&#xD;
for you -begone! If you have any regard for your&#xD;
own safety, I say, begone."&#xD;
Cook and Ramsay, without a further word, mount-&#xD;
ed their horses and rode away. ' Tibeats, in a few&#xD;
minutes, evidently in fear, and overawed by the. deci-&#xD;
ded tone of Chapin, sneaked off like a coward, as he&#xD;
was, and mounting his horse, followed his companions.&#xD;
I remained standing where I was, still bound, with&#xD;
the rope around my neck. As soon as -they were&#xD;
gone, Chapin called Rachel, ordering her to run to&#xD;
the field, and tell Lawson to hurry to the house with-&#xD;
out delay, and bring the brown mule with him, an&#xD;
animal much prized for its unusual fleetness. Pres-&#xD;

"Lawson," said Chapin, "you must go to the Pine&#xD;
Woods. Tell your master Ford to come here at once&#xD;
-that he must not delay a single moment. Tell him&#xD;
they are trying to murder Platt. Now hurry, boy.&#xD;
Be at the Pine Woods by noon if.you kill the mule."&#xD;
Chapin stepped into the house and wrote a pass.&#xD;
When he returned, Lawson was at the door, mounted&#xD;
&#xD;
on his mule. Receiving the pass, he plied the whip&#xD;
right smartly to the beast, dashed out of the yard, and&#xD;
turning up the bayou on a hard gallop, in less time&#xD;
than it has taken me to describe the scene, was out&#xD;
of sight.&#xD;

EXPOUNDS THE SCRIPTURESr-DESCRIPTION OF THE STOCKS.&#xD;
As the sun approached the meridian that day it be-&#xD;
came insufferably warm.       Its hot rays -scorched the&#xD;
ground. The earth almost blistered the foot that stood&#xD;
upon it. I was without coat or hat, standing bare-&#xD;
headed, exposed to its burning blaze. Great drops.&#xD;
of perspiration rolled down my face, drenching the&#xD;
scanty apparel wherewith I was clothed. Over the&#xD;
fence, a very little way off, the peach trees cast their&#xD;
cool, delicious shadows on the grass.    I would gladly&#xD;
have given a long year of service to have been ena-&#xD;
bled to exchange the heated oven, as it were, where-&#xD;
in I stood, for a seat beneath their branches. But I&#xD;
was yet bound, th rope still dangling from    my neck,&#xD;
and standing in the same tracks where Tibeats and&#xD;
his comrades left me.     I could not move an inch, so&#xD;
firmly had I been bound., To have been enabled to&#xD;
&#xD;
lean against the weaving house would have been a&#xD;
luxury indeed. But it was far beyond my reach,&#xD;
though distant less than twenty feet. I wanted to lie&#xD;
down, but knew I could.not rise again. The ground&#xD;
was so parched and boiling hot I was aware it would&#xD;
but add to the discomfort of my situation. If I could&#xD;
have only moved my position, however slightly, it&#xD;
would have been relief unspeakable. But t'he hot&#xD;
rays of a southern sun, beating all the long summer&#xD;
day'on my bare head, produced not .half the suffer-&#xD;
ing I experienced from my aching limbs. My wrists&#xD;
and ankles, and the cords of my legs and arms began&#xD;
to swell, burying the rope that bound them into the .&#xD;
swollen flesh.&#xD;
All day Chapin walked back and forth upon the&#xD;
stoop, but not once approached me. Tie appeared to-&#xD;
be in a state of great uneasiness, looking first&#xD;
towards me, and then up the road, as if expecting&#xD;
some arrival every moment. lie did not go to the&#xD;
field, as -was his custom. It was evident from his man-&#xD;
ner that he supposed Tibeats would return with more&#xD;
and better armed assistance, perhaps, to renew the&#xD;
quarrel, and it was equally evident he had;prepared&#xD;
his mind to defend my life at whatever hazard.&#xD;
Why he did not relieve me -why he suffered me to&#xD;
remain in agony the whole weary day, I never knew.&#xD;
It was not for want of sympathy,I amy certain. Per-&#xD;
l-ps he wished Ford to see the rope about my neck,&#xD;
and the brutal manner in which I had been bound;&#xD;
perhaps his interference with another's property in&#xD;

which he had no legal interest might have been a&#xD;
trespass, which would have subjected him to the pen-&#xD;
al y of the law.' Why Tibeats was all day absent was&#xD;
another mystery I never could divine. He knew well&#xD;
enough that Chapin would not harm him unless he&#xD;
persisted in his design against me. Lawson told me&#xD;
afterwards, that, as he passed the plantation of John&#xD;
David Cheney, he saw the three, and that they turned&#xD;
and looked after him as he flew by. I think his sup-&#xD;
position.was, that Lawson had been sent out by Over-&#xD;
seer Chapin to arouse the neighboring' planters, and&#xD;
to call on them to come to his assistance. He, there-&#xD;
fore, undoubtedly, acted on the principle, that "dis&#xD;
cretion is the better part of valor," and kept away.&#xD;
But whatever motive may have governed the cow-&#xD;
ardly and malignant tyrant, it is of no importance.&#xD;
There I still stood in the noon-tide sun, groaning with&#xD;
pain. From long before daylight I had not eaten a&#xD;
morsel. I was growing faint from pain, and thirst,&#xD;
and hunger. Once only, in the very hottest portion&#xD;
of the day, Rachel, half fearful she was acting con-&#xD;
trary to the overseer's wishes, ventured to me, and&#xD;
held' a cup of water to my lips. The humble crea-&#xD;
ture never knew, nor could she comprehend if she&#xD;
had heard them, the blessings I invoked upon her,&#xD;
for that balmy draught. She could only say, "Oh,&#xD;
Platt, how I do pity you," and then hastened back to&#xD;
her labors in the kitchen.&#xD;
Never did the sun move so'slowly through the&#xD;
heavens --never did it shower down such fervent and&#xD;
&#xD;
ARRIvAL OF FoRD.             :21&#xD;
fiery rays, as it did that day. At least, so it appear-&#xD;
ed to me. What my meditations were- the innume-&#xD;
rable thoughts that thronged through my distracted&#xD;
rain - I will -not attempt to give expression to.&#xD;
Suffice it to say, during the whole long day I came&#xD;
not to the conclusion, even once, that the southern&#xD;
slave, fed, clothed, whipped and protected by his&#xD;
master, is happier than the free colored citizen of the&#xD;
North. To that conclusion I have never since arri-&#xD;
ved. There are many, however, even in the Northern&#xD;
States, benevolent and well-disposed men, who will&#xD;
pronounce my opinion erroneous, and gravely proceed&#xD;
to substantiate the assertion with an argument. Alas!&#xD;
they have never drnnk, as I have, from the bitter cup&#xD;
of slavery. Just at sunset my heart leaped with.un-&#xD;
bounded joy, as Ford came riding into the yard, his&#xD;
horse covered with foam. Chapin met him at the&#xD;
door, and after conversing a short time, he walked&#xD;
directly to me-&#xD;
Poor Platt, you are in a bad state," was the only&#xD;
expression that escaped his lips.&#xD;
Thank God !" said I, "thank God; Master Ford,&#xD;
that you have come at last."&#xD;
Drawing a knife from his pocket, he indignantly&#xD;
cut the cord from my wrists, arms, ard ankles, and&#xD;
slipped the noose from my neck. I attempted to&#xD;
walk, but staggered like a drunken man, and fell par-&#xD;
tially to the ground.&#xD;
Ford returned immediately to the house, leaving&#xD;
me alone again. As he reached the piazza, Tibeatu&#xD;
F.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC7339-00000065"/>&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
and his two friends rode up. A long dialogue fol&#xD;
lowed. I could hear the sound of their voices, the&#xD;
mild tones of Ford mingling with the angry accents'&#xD;
of Tibeats, but was unable to distinguish what was&#xD;
said. Finally the three departed again, apparently&#xD;
not well pleased.&#xD;
I endeavored to raise the hammer, thinking to show&#xD;
Ford how willing I was to work, by proceeding with&#xD;
my labors on the weaving house, but it fell from my&#xD;
nerveless hand. At dark I crawled into the cabin,&#xD;
and laid down. I was in great misery - all. sore and&#xD;
swollen-the slightest movement producing excruci-&#xD;
ating suffering. Soon the hands came in from- the&#xD;
field. Rachel, when she went after Lawson, had told&#xD;
them what had happened. Eliza and Mary broiled&#xD;
me a piece of bacon, but my appetite was gone.&#xD;
Then they scorched some corn meal and made coffee.&#xD;
It was all that I could take. Eliza consoled me and&#xD;
was very kind. It was not long before the cabin was&#xD;
full of slaves. They gathered round me, asking many&#xD;
questions about the difficulty with Tibeats in the&#xD;
morning - and the particulars of all the occurrences&#xD;
of the day. Then Rachel came in, and in her simple&#xD;
language, repeated it over again-dwelling emphat-&#xD;
ically on the kick that sent Tibeats rolling over on&#xD;
the ground - whereupon there was a general titter&#xD;
throughout the crowd. Then she described how Cha-&#xD;
pin walked out with his pistols and rescued me,&#xD;
and how Master Ford cut the ropes with his knife,&#xD;
just as if he was mad.&#xD;
&#xD;
Iy this tine Lawson had returned. He had -to&#xD;
regale them with in account of his trip to the Pine&#xD;
Woods-how the brown mule bore him faster than&#xD;
a " streak o' lightnin" -how lie astonished everybody&#xD;
as he flew along -bhow Master Ford started right&#xD;
away-how he said Platt was a good nigger, and&#xD;
they shouldn't kill him, concluding with pretty strong&#xD;
intimations that there was not another human being&#xD;
in the wide woi'ld, who could have created such a&#xD;
universal sensation oiln the road, or performed such a&#xD;
marvelous John Gilpin feat, as he had done that day&#xD;
on the browi mule.&#xD;
The kind creatures loaded me with the expression&#xD;
of their sympathy -saying, Tibeats was a hard, cruel&#xD;
man, and hoping "Massa Ford" would get me back&#xD;
again. In this manner they passed the time, discus-&#xD;
sing, chatting, talking over and over again the exci-&#xD;
ting affair, until suddenly Chapin presented himself&#xD;
at the cabin door and called me.&#xD;
"Platt," said he, "you will sleep on the floor in the&#xD;
great house to-night ; bring your blanket with you."&#xD;
I arose as quickly as I was able, took my blanket&#xD;
in my hand, and followed him. On the way he in-&#xD;
formed me that lie should not wonder if Tibeats was&#xD;
back again before morning -that lie intended to kill&#xD;
me --and that he did not mean he should do it with-&#xD;
out witnesses. Had he. stabbed me to the heart in&#xD;
the presence of a'hundred slaves, not one of then, by&#xD;
the laws of Louisiana, could have given evidence&#xD;
against him. I laid down on the floor in the "great&#xD;

house"-the first and the last time such a sumptu-&#xD;
ous resting place was granted me during my twelve&#xD;
years of bondage - and tried to sleep. Near midnight&#xD;
the dog began to bark. Chapin arose, looked from&#xD;
the window, but could discover nothing. At length&#xD;
the dog was quiet. As he returned to his room, he said,&#xD;
"I believe, Platt, that scoundrel is skulking about&#xD;
the premises somewhere. If the dog barks again, and&#xD;
I am sleeping, wake me."&#xD;
I promised to do so. After the lapse of an hour or&#xD;
more, the dog re-commenced his clamor, running&#xD;
towards the gate, then back again, all the while bark&#xD;
ing furiously.&#xD;
Chapin was out of bed without waiting to be called.&#xD;
On this occasion, he stepped forth upon the piazza,&#xD;
and remained standing there a considerable length of&#xD;
time. Nothing, however, was to be, seen, and the&#xD;
dog returned to his kennel. We were not disturbed&#xD;
again during the night. _ The excessive pain that I&#xD;
suffered, and the dread of some impending danger,&#xD;
prevented any rest whatever. Whether.or not Tibe-&#xD;
ats did actually return to the plantation tha night,&#xD;
seeking an opportunity to wreak his vengeance upon&#xD;
me, is a secret known only to himself, perhaps. I&#xD;
thought then, however, and have the strong impres-&#xD;
sion still, that he was there. At all events, he had'&#xD;
the disposition of. an assassin-cowering before a&#xD;
brave man's words,,but ready to strike his helpless or&#xD;
unsuspecting victim in the ack, as I had reason af-&#xD;
terwards to know.&#xD;

&#xD;
At daylight in the morning, I arose, sore and wea-&#xD;
ry, having rested little. Nevertheless, after partaking&#xD;
breakfast, which Mary and Eliza had prepared for me&#xD;
in the cabin, I proceeded to the weaving-house and&#xD;
commenced-the labors of another day. It was Cha-&#xD;
pi's practice, as it is the practice of overseers gen&#xD;
erally, inmediately on arising, to bestride his horse,&#xD;
always saddled and bridled and ready for him -&#xD;
the particular business of some slave -and ride into&#xD;
the field. This morning, on the contrary, he. came to&#xD;
the weaving-house, asking if I had seen anything of&#xD;
Tibeats yet. Replyirng in the negative, he remarked&#xD;
there was something not right about the fellow-&#xD;
there was bad blood in him -that I must keep a&#xD;
sharp watch of him, or lie would do me wrong some&#xD;
day when-I least expected it.&#xD;
While he was yet speaking, Tibeats rode in,.hitched&#xD;
his horse, and entered the house. I had little fear of&#xD;
him while Ford and Chapin were at hand, but they&#xD;
could not be near me always.&#xD;
Oh ! how heavily the weight of slavery pressed&#xD;
upon me then. I must toil day after day, endure&#xD;
abuse and taunts and scoffs, sleep on the hard ground,&#xD;
live on the coarsest fare, and not only this, but live&#xD;
the slave of a blood-seeking wretch, of whom I must&#xD;
stand henceforth in continued fear and dread. Why&#xD;
had I not died in my young years -before God had&#xD;
given me children to love and live for? What un-&#xD;
happiness and suffering and sorrow it would have&#xD;
prevented. I sighed for liberty; but the boncman's&#xD;

chain was round me, and could not be shaken off. I&#xD;
could only gaze wistfully towards the North; and&#xD;
think of the thousands of miles that stretched between&#xD;
me and the soil of freedom, over which a black free-&#xD;
man may not pass.&#xD;
Tibeats, in the course of half an hour, walked over&#xD;
to the weaving-house, looked at me sharply, then re-&#xD;
turned without saying anything. Most of the fore-&#xD;
noon he sat on the piazza, reading a newspaper and&#xD;
conversing with Ford. After dinner, the latter left&#xD;
for the Pine Woods, and it was indeed with regret&#xD;
that I beheld him depart from-the plantation.&#xD;
Once more during the day Tibeats came to me,&#xD;
gave me some order, and returned.&#xD;
During the week the weaving-house was completed&#xD;
-Tibeats in the meantime making no allusion what-&#xD;
ever to the difficulty-when I was informed he had&#xD;
hired me to Peter Tanner, to work under another car-&#xD;
penter by the name of Myers. This announcement&#xD;
was received with gratification, as any place was de-&#xD;
sirable that would relieve me of his hateful presence.&#xD;
Peter Tanner, as the reader has already been in-&#xD;
formed, lived on the opposite shore, and was the broth.&#xD;
er of Mistress Ford. He is one of the most extensive&#xD;
planters on Bayou Bocuf, and owns a large number&#xD;
of slaves.&#xD;
Over I went to Tanner's, joyfully enough. lie had&#xD;
heard. of my late difficulties -in fact, I ascertained&#xD;
the flogging of Tibeats was soon blazoned far and wide.&#xD;
This affair, together with my rafting experiment, had&#xD;
&#xD;
rendered me somewhat notorious. More than once I&#xD;
heard it said that Platt Ford, now Platt Tibeats-a&#xD;
slave's name changes with his. change of master -was&#xD;
" a devil of a nigger." But I was destined to make a&#xD;
still further noise, as will presently be seen, through-&#xD;
out the little world of Bayou-Boeuf.&#xD;
Peter Tanner endeavored to impress upon me the&#xD;
idea that he was quite severe, though I could per-&#xD;
ceive there was a vein of good humor in the old fel-&#xD;
low, after all.&#xD;
" You're the nigger," he said to me on my arrival&#xD;
-" You're the nigger that flogged your master, ehi&#xD;
You're the nigger that kicks, and holds carpenter&#xD;
Tibeats by the leg, and wallops him, are ye I I'dlike&#xD;
to see you hold me by the leg -I should. You're a&#xD;
'portant character - you're a great nigger-very re-&#xD;
markable nigger, ain't yei I'd lash you -I'd take&#xD;
the tantrums out of ye. Jest take hold of my leg, if&#xD;
you please. None of your. pranks here, my boy, re-&#xD;
member that. Now go to work, you kicki' rascal,"&#xD;
concluded Peter Tanner, unable to- suppress a half-&#xD;
comical grin at his own wit and sarcasm.&#xD;
After listening to this salutation, I was taken charge&#xD;
of by Myers, and labored under his direction for a&#xD;
month, to his and my own satisfaction.&#xD;
Like William Ford, his brother-in-law, Tanner was&#xD;
in the habit of reading the Bible to his slaves on the&#xD;
Sabbath, but in a somewhat different spirit. He was&#xD;
an =impressive commentator on the New-Testament.&#xD;

&#xD;
he called them together, and began to read the twelfth&#xD;
chapter of Luke. When he came to the 47th verse,&#xD;
he looked deliberately around him, and continued&#xD;
"And that servant which knew his lord's will,"-here&#xD;
he paused, looking around more deliberately than be-&#xD;
fore, and again proceeded -1" which knew his lord's&#xD;
will, and prepared not himself "-here was another&#xD;
pause -"prepared not himself, neither did according&#xD;
to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes."&#xD;
" D'ye hear that?" demanded Peter, emphatically.&#xD;
"Stripes," he repeated, slowly and distinctly, taking&#xD;
off his spectacles, preparatory to making a few _re-&#xD;
marks.&#xD;
"That nigger that don't take care- that don't obey&#xD;
his lord - that's his master - d'ye see ? - that 'ere&#xD;
nigger shall be beaten with many stripes. Now,&#xD;
'many' signifies a great many -forty, a hundred,&#xD;
a hundred and fifty lashes. That's Scripter!" and so&#xD;
Peter continued to elucidate the subject for a great&#xD;
length of time, much to the edification of his sable&#xD;
audience.&#xD;
At the conclusion of the exercises, calling up three&#xD;
of his slaves, Warner, Will and Maj or, he cried out&#xD;
to me -&#xD;
"Here, Platt, you held Tibeats by the legs; now I'll&#xD;
see if you can hold these rascals in the same way, till&#xD;
I get back from meeting. "&#xD;
Thereupon he ordered them to the stocks -a com-&#xD;
mon thing on plantations in the Red River country..&#xD;
The stocks are formed of two planks, the lower one&#xD;
&#xD;
made fast at the ends to two short posts, driven firmly&#xD;
into the ground.  At regular distances half circles&#xD;
are cut in the upper edge. The other plank is fas=&#xD;
tened to one of the posts by a hinge, so that it can be&#xD;
opened or shut down, in the same manner as the blade&#xD;
of a pocket-knife is shut or opened. In the lower edge&#xD;
of the upper plank corresponding half circles -are also&#xD;
cut, so that When they close, a row ,of holes is formed&#xD;
large enough to admit a negro's leg above the ankle,&#xD;
but not large enough to enable him to draw out his&#xD;
foot. The other end of the upper plank, opposite the&#xD;
hinge, is fastened to its post by lock and key. The&#xD;
slave is made to sit upon the ground, when the upper-.&#xD;
most plank is elevated, his legs, just above the ankles,&#xD;
placed in the sub-half circles, and shutting it down&#xD;
'again, and locking it, he is held secure and fast. Very&#xD;
often the neck instead of the ankle is enclosed. In&#xD;
this manner they are held 'during the operation of&#xD;
whipping.&#xD;
Wariner, Will and Major, according to Tanner's ac-&#xD;
count of them, were melon-stealing, Sabbath-break-&#xD;
ing niggers, and not approving of such wickedness, he&#xD;
felt it his duty to put them in the stocks. Handing&#xD;
me the key, himself, Myers, Mistress Tanner and the&#xD;
children entered the carriage and drove away to&#xD;
church at Cheneyville. When they were gone, the,&#xD;
boys begged me to let them out. I felt sorry to see&#xD;
them sitting on the hot ground, and remembered my&#xD;
own sufferings in the sun. Upon their promise to re-&#xD;
turn to the stocks at any moment they were required&#xD;

to do so, I consented to release them. Grateful for&#xD;
the lenity shown them, and in order in some meas-&#xD;
ure .to repay it, they could do no less, of course,&#xD;
than pilot me to the melon-patch. Shortly before&#xD;
Tanner's return, they were in the stocks again.&#xD;
Finally he drove up, and looking at the boys, said, with&#xD;
a chuckle,-&#xD;
" Aha ! ye havn't been strolling about much to-day,&#xD;
any way. I'll teach you what's what. I'll tire ye&#xD;
of eating water-melons on the Lord's day, ye Sabbath-&#xD;
breaking niggers."&#xD;
Peter Tanner prided himself upon his strict religious&#xD;
observances: he was a deacon in the church.&#xD;
But I have now reached a point in the progress of&#xD;
my narrative, when it becomes necessary to turn away&#xD;
from these light descriptions, to the more grave and&#xD;
weighty matter of the second battle with Master Tib-&#xD;
eats, and the flight through the great Pacoudrie&#xD;
Swamp.&#xD;

AT the end of a month, my services being no lon-&#xD;
ger required at Tanner's I was sent over the bayou&#xD;
again to my master, whom I found engaged in build-&#xD;
ing th e'cotton press.  This was situated at some dis-&#xD;
tance from the great house, in a rather retired place.&#xD;
I conunenced working once more in company with&#xD;
Tibeats, being entirely alone with him most part of&#xD;
the time. I remembered the words of Chapin, his&#xD;
precautions, his advice to beware, lest in some unsus-&#xD;
pecting moment he might injure ine. They were al&#xD;
ways in my mind, so that I lived in a most uneasy&#xD;
state of apprehension and fear. One eye was on my&#xD;
work, the other on my master. I determined to give&#xD;
him no cause of offence, to work still more diligently,&#xD;

if possible, than I had done, to bear whatever abuse&#xD;
he might heap upon me, save bodily injury, humbly&#xD;
aid patiently, hoping thereby to soften in some de-&#xD;
gree his manner towards me, until the blessed time&#xD;
might come when I should be delivered from his&#xD;
clutches.&#xD;
The third morning after my return, Chapin left the&#xD;
plantation for Cheneyville, to be absent until night.&#xD;
Tibeats, on that morning, was attacked with one of&#xD;
those periodical fits of spleen and ill-humor to which&#xD;
he was frequently subject, rendering him still more&#xD;
disagreeable and venomous than usual.&#xD;
It was about nine o'clock in the forenoon, when I&#xD;
was busily employed with the jack-plane on one of the&#xD;
sweeps. Tibeats was standing by the work-bench,&#xD;
fitting a handle into the chisel, with which he had&#xD;
been engaged previously in cutting the thread of the&#xD;
screw.&#xD;
"You are not planing that down enough," said lie.&#xD;
"It is just even with the line," I replied.&#xD;
" You're a d-d liar," he exclaimed passionately.&#xD;
"Oh, well, master," I said, mildly, "I will plane it&#xD;
down more if you say so," at the same time proceed-&#xD;
ing to do as I supposed he desired. Before one sha-&#xD;
ving had been removed, however, lie cried out, say-&#xD;
ing I had now planed it too deep -it was too small&#xD;
-I had spoiled the sweep entirely. Then followed&#xD;
curses and imprecations. I had endeavored to do ex-&#xD;
actly as he directed, but nothing would satisfy the un-&#xD;
reasonable man. In silence and in dread I stood by the&#xD;
&#xD;
sweep, holding the jack-plane in my hand, not know-&#xD;
ing what to do, and not daring to be idle. His anger&#xD;
grew more and more violent, until, finally, with an&#xD;
oath, such a bitter, frightful oath as only Tibeats could&#xD;
utter, he seized 'a hatchet from the work-bench and&#xD;
darted towards me, swearing he would cut my head&#xD;
open.&#xD;
It was a moment of life or death. The sharp, bright&#xD;
blade of the hatchet glittered in the sun. In another&#xD;
instant it would be buried in my brain, and yet in&#xD;
that instant -so quick will a man's thoughts come to&#xD;
him in such a fearful strait -I reasoned with my-&#xD;
self. If I stood still, my doom vas certain; if I fled,&#xD;
ten chances to one the hatchet, flying from his hand&#xD;
.with a too-deadly and unerring aim, would strike me&#xD;
in the back. There was but one course to take.&#xD;
Springing towards him with all my power, and meet-&#xD;
ing him full half-way, before he could bring down the&#xD;
blow, within one hand I caught his uplifted arm, with&#xD;
the other seized him by the throat. We stood look-&#xD;
ing each other in the eyes. In his I could see mur-&#xD;
der. I felt as if I had a serpent by the neck, watch-&#xD;
ing the slightest relaxation of my gripe, to coil itself&#xD;
round my body, crushing and stinging it to death. I&#xD;
thought to scream aloud, trusting that some ear might&#xD;
catch the sound -but Chapin was away; the hands&#xD;
were in the field; there was no living soul in sight&#xD;
or hearing.&#xD;
The good genius, which thus far through life has&#xD;
saved me from the hands of violence, at, that moment&#xD;

suggested a lucky thought. With a vigorous and&#xD;
sudden kick, that brought him on one knee, with a&#xD;
groan, I released my hold upon his throat, snatched&#xD;
the hatchet, and cast it beyond reach.&#xD;
Frantic with rage, maddened beyond control, he&#xD;
seized a white oak stick, five feet long, perhaps, and&#xD;
as large in circumference as his hand could grasp,&#xD;
which was lying on the ground. Again he rushed&#xD;
towards me, and again I met him, seized him about&#xD;
the waist, and being the stronger of the two, bore&#xD;
huin to the earth. While in that position I obtained&#xD;
possession of the stick, and .rising, cast it from me,&#xD;
also.&#xD;
He likewise arose and ran for the broad-axe, on the&#xD;
work-bench. Fortunately, there was a heavy plank-&#xD;
lying upon its broad blade, in such a manner that he&#xD;
could not extricate it, before I had sprung upon his&#xD;
back. Pressing him down closely and heavily on the&#xD;
plank, so that the axe was held more firmly to its&#xD;
place, I endeavored, but in vain, to break his grasp&#xD;
upon the handle. In that position we remained some&#xD;
minutes.&#xD;
There have been hours in my unhappy life, many&#xD;
of them, when the contemplation of death as the end&#xD;
of earthly sorrow-of the grave as a resting place&#xD;
for the tired and worn out body -has -been pleasant&#xD;
to dwell upon. But such contemplations vanish in the&#xD;
hour of peril. No man, in his full strength, can&#xD;
stand undismayed, in the presence of the "king of&#xD;
terrors." Life is dear to every living thing; the&#xD;

worm that crawls upon the ground will struggle, for&#xD;
it. At that moment it was dear to me, enslaved and&#xD;
treated as I was.&#xD;
Not able to unloose his hand, once more I seized&#xD;
him by the throat, and this time, with a vice-like&#xD;
gripe that soon relaxed his hold. lie became pliant&#xD;
and unstrung. His face, that had been white with&#xD;
passion, was now black from suffocation. 'Those small&#xD;
serpent eyes that spat such venom, were now full of&#xD;
horror-two great white orbs starting from their&#xD;
sockets !&#xD;
There was "a lurking devil" in my heart that&#xD;
prompted me to kill the human blood-hound on the&#xD;
spot-to retain the gripe on his accursed .throat till&#xD;
the breath of life was gone! I dared not murder&#xD;
lim, and I dared not let him live. If I killed him,&#xD;
my life must pay the forfeit -if he lived, my life&#xD;
only would satisfy his vengeance. A voice within&#xD;
whispered mie to fly. To be a wanderer among the&#xD;
swainpsa fugitive and a vagabond on the face of&#xD;
the earth, was preferable to the life that I was lead-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
My resolution was soon formed, and swinging him&#xD;
from the work-bench to the ground, I leaped a fence&#xD;
near by, and hurried across the plantation, passing&#xD;
the slaves at work in the cotton field. At the end of&#xD;
a quarter of a mile I reached the wood-pasture, and&#xD;
it was a short time indeed that I had been running&#xD;
it. Climbing on to a. high fence, I could see the&#xD;
cotton press, the great house, and the space between.&#xD;

It was a conspicuous position, from whence the whole&#xD;
plantation was in view. I saw Tibeats cross the field&#xD;
towards the house, and enter it - then he came out,&#xD;
carrying his saddle, and presently mounted his horse&#xD;
and galloped away.&#xD;
I was desolate, but thankful. Thankful that my&#xD;
life was spared,-- desolate and discouraged with the&#xD;
prospect before me. What would become of me?&#xD;
Who would befriend me? Whither should I fly?&#xD;
Oh, God! Thou who gayest me life, and implanted&#xD;
in my bosom the love of life - who filled it with&#xD;
emotions such as other men, thy creatures, have, do&#xD;
not forsake me. Have pity on. the poor slave -let&#xD;
me not perish. If thou dost not protect me, I am&#xD;
lost-lost! Such supplications, silently and unut-&#xD;
tered, ascended from my inmost heart to Heaven.&#xD;
But there was no answering yoice -no sweet, low&#xD;
tone, coming down from on high, whispering to my&#xD;
soul, "It is I, be not afraid." I was the forsaken of&#xD;
God, it seemed -the despised and hated of men!&#xD;
In about three-fourths of an hour several of the&#xD;
slaves shouted and made signs for me to run. Pres-&#xD;
ently, looking up the bayou, I saw Tibeats and two&#xD;
others on horse-back, coming at a fast gait, followed&#xD;
by a troop of dogs. There were as many as eight or&#xD;
ten. Distant as I was, I knew them. They belonged&#xD;
on the adjoining plantation. The dogs used on Bayou&#xD;
Bouf for hunting slaves are a kind of blood-hound,&#xD;
but a far more'savage breed than is found in the&#xD;
Northern States. They will attack a negro, at their&#xD;

master's bidding, and cling to him as the common&#xD;
bull-dog will cling to a four footed animal. Fre-&#xD;
quently their loud bay is heard in the swamps, and&#xD;
then there is speculation as to what point the runaway&#xD;
will be overhauled -the same as a New-York hunter&#xD;
stops to listen to the hounds coursing along the hill-&#xD;
sides, and suggests to his companion that the fox will&#xD;
be taken at such a place. I never knew a slave es-&#xD;
caping with his life from Bayou Bcouf. One reason&#xD;
is, they are not allowed to learn the art of swimming,&#xD;
and are incapable of crossing the most inconsiderable&#xD;
stream. In their flight they can go in no direction&#xD;
but a little way without coming to a bayou, when the&#xD;
inevitable alternative is presented, of being drowned&#xD;
or overtaken by the dogs. In youth I had practised&#xD;
in the clear streams that flow through my native dis-&#xD;
trict, until I had become an expert swimmer, and felt&#xD;
at home in the watery element.&#xD;
I stood upon the fence until the dogs had reached&#xD;
the cotton press. In an instant more, their long, sav-&#xD;
age yells announced they were on my track. Leap-&#xD;
ing down from my position, I ran towards the swamp.&#xD;
Fear gave me strength, and I exerted it to the utmost.&#xD;
Every few moments I could hear the yelpings of the&#xD;
dogs. They were gaining upon me. Every howl&#xD;
was nearer and nearer. Eac1h moment I expected&#xD;
they would spring upon my back -expected to feel&#xD;
their long teeth sinking into my flesh. There were&#xD;
so many of them, I knew they would tear me to pie-&#xD;
ces, that they would worry me, at once,;to death. I&#xD;

gasped for breath -gasped forth a half-uttered, cho-&#xD;
king prayer to the Ahriighty to save me -to give me&#xD;
strength to reach some wide, deep bayou where I&#xD;
could throw them off the track, or sink into its wa-&#xD;
ters. Presently I reached a thick palmetto bottom.&#xD;
As I fled through them they made a loud rustling&#xD;
noise, not loud enough, however, to drown the voices&#xD;
tf the dogs.&#xD;
Continuing my course due south, as nearly as I can&#xD;
pidge, I came at length to water just over shoe.&#xD;
[he hounds at that moment could not have been five&#xD;
rods behind me. I could hear them crashing and&#xD;
plunging through the palmettoes, their loud, eager&#xD;
yells making the whole swamp clamorous with the&#xD;
sound. Hope revived a little as I reached the water.&#xD;
If it were only deeper, they might loose the scent, and&#xD;
thus disconcerted, afford me the opportunity of eva-&#xD;
ding them. Luckily, it grew deeper the farther I&#xD;
proceeded -now over my ankles -now half-way to&#xD;
my knees -now sinking a moment to my waist, and.&#xD;
then emerging presently into more shallow places.&#xD;
The dogs had not gained upon me since I struck the&#xD;
water. Evidently they were confused. Now their&#xD;
savage intonations grew more and more distant, as-&#xD;
suring me that I was leaving them. Finally I stop-&#xD;
ped to listen, but the long howl came booming on the&#xD;
air gain, telling me I was not yet safe. From bog to&#xD;
bog, where I had stepped, they could still keep upon&#xD;
the track, though impeded by the water. At length,&#xD;
to my great joy, I came to a wide bayou, and plung-&#xD;

ing in, had soon stemmed its sluggish current to the&#xD;
other side. There, certainly, the dogs would be con-&#xD;
foundcded-the current carrying down the stream all&#xD;
traces of that slight, mysterious scent, which enables&#xD;
the quick-smelling hound to follow in the track of the&#xD;
fugitive.&#xD;
After crossing this bayou the water became so&#xD;
deep I could not run. I was now in what I after-&#xD;
wards learned was the " Great Pacoudrie Swamp."&#xD;
It was filled with immense trees -the sycamore, the&#xD;
gum, the cotton wood and cypress, and extends, I am&#xD;
informed, to the shore of the Calcasieu river. For&#xD;
thirty or forty miles it is without inhabitants, save&#xD;
wild beasts -the bear, the wild-cat the tiger, and&#xD;
great slimy reptiles, that are crawling through it&#xD;
everywhere. Long before I reached the bayou, in&#xD;
fact, from the time I struck the water until I emer-&#xD;
ged from  the swamp on my return, these reptiles&#xD;
surrounded me. I saw hundreds of moccasin snakes.&#xD;
Every log and bog - every trunk of a fallen tree,&#xD;
over which I was compelled to step - or climb, was&#xD;
alive with them. They crawled away at my ap-&#xD;
proach, but sometimes in my haste, I almost placed&#xD;
my hand or foot upon them. They are poisonous&#xD;
serpents-- their bite more fatal than the rattlesnake's.&#xD;
Besides, I had lost one shoe, the sole having conie&#xD;
entirely off, leaving the upper only dangling to my&#xD;
ankle.&#xD;
I saw also many alligators, great and small, lying&#xD;
in the water, or on pieces of floodwood. The noise I&#xD;

made usually startled them, when they moved off and&#xD;
plunged into the deepest places. Sometimes, how.&#xD;
ever, I would come directly upon a monster before&#xD;
observing it. In such cases, I would start back, riun&#xD;
a short way round, and in that manner shun them.&#xD;
Straight forward, they will run a short distance rapid ly,&#xD;
but do not possess the power of turning. In a crook..0&#xD;
ed race, there is no difficulty in evading them.&#xD;
About two o'clock in the afternoon, I heard the&#xD;
last of the hounds. Probably they did not cross the&#xD;
bayou. Wet and weary, but relieved from the sense&#xD;
of instant peril, I continued on, more cautions and&#xD;
afraid, however, of the snakes and alligators than I&#xD;
had been in the earlier portion of my flight. Now,&#xD;
before stepping into a muddy pool, I would strike&#xD;
the water with a stick. If the waters moved, I would&#xD;
go around it, if not, would venture through.&#xD;
At length the sun went down, and gradually night's&#xD;
trailing mantle shrouded the great swamp in dark-&#xD;
ness. Still I staggered on, fearing every instant 1&#xD;
should feel the dreadful sting of the moccasin, or be&#xD;
crushed within the jaws of some disturbed alligator.&#xD;
The dread of them now almost equaled the fear of&#xD;
the pursuing hounds. The moon arose after a time,&#xD;
its mild light creeping through the overspreading&#xD;
branches, loaded with long, pendent moss. I kept&#xD;
traveling forwards until after midnight, hoping all&#xD;
the while that I would soon emerge into some less&#xD;
desolate and dangerous region. But the water grew&#xD;
deeper and the walking more difficult than ever. I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
perceived it would be impossible, to proceed, much&#xD;
farther, and knew not, moreover, what hands I might&#xD;
fall into, should I succeed in reaching a human hab-&#xD;
itation. Not provided with a pass, any white man&#xD;
would be at liberty to arrest me, and place me in&#xD;
prison until such time as my master should "prove&#xD;
property, pay charges, and take me away." I was an&#xD;
estray, and if so unfortunate as to meet a law-abiding&#xD;
citizen of Louisiana, lie would deem it his duty to his&#xD;
neighbor, perhaps, to put me forthwith in the pound.&#xD;
Really, it was difficult to determine which I had most&#xD;
reason to fear -dogs, alligators or men !&#xD;
After midnight, however, I came to a halt. Ima-&#xD;
gination cannot picture the dreariness of the scene.&#xD;
The swamp was resonant with the quacking of innu-&#xD;
merable ducks! Since the foundation of the earth,&#xD;
in all probability, a human footstep had never before&#xD;
so far penetrated the recesses of the swamp. It was&#xD;
not silent now - silent to a degree that rendered it&#xD;
oppressive, -as it was when the sun was shining in&#xD;
the heavens. My midnight intrusion had awakened&#xD;
the feathered tribes, which seemed to throng the mo-&#xD;
rass in hundreds of thousands, and their garrulous&#xD;
throats poured forth such multitudinous sounds -&#xD;
there was such a fluttering of wings - such sullen&#xD;
plunges in the water all around me-that I was af-&#xD;
frighted and appalled. All the fowls of the air, and&#xD;
all the creeping things of the earth appeared to have&#xD;
assembled together in that particular place, for the&#xD;
purpose of filling it with clamor and confusion. Not&#xD;

THE SLAVE AND HIS MASTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
by human dwellings-not in crowded cities alone,&#xD;
are the sights and sounds of life. The wildest places&#xD;
of the earth are full of them. Even in the heart of&#xD;
that dismal swamp, God had provided a refuge and a&#xD;
dwelling place for millions of living things.&#xD;
The moon had now risen above the trees, when I&#xD;
resolved upon a new project. Thus far Ilhad endeav-&#xD;
ored to travel as nearly south as possible. Turning&#xD;
about I proceeded in a north-west- direction, my ob-&#xD;
ject being to strike the Pine Woods in the vicinity of&#xD;
Master Ford's. Once within the shadow of his pro&#xD;
tection, I felt I would be comparatively safe.&#xD;
My clothes were in tatters, my hands, face, and&#xD;
body covered with scratches, received from the sharp&#xD;
knots of fallen trees, and in climbing over piles of&#xD;
brush and floodwood. My bare foot was full of thorns.&#xD;
I was besmeared with muck and mud, and the green&#xD;
slime that had collected on the surface of the dead&#xD;
water, in which I had been immersed to the neck&#xD;
many times during the day and night. Hour after&#xD;
hour, and tiresome indeed had they become, I contin-&#xD;
ued to plod along on my north-west course. The wa-&#xD;
ter began to grow less deep, and the ground more firm&#xD;
under my feet. At last I reached the Pacoudrie, the&#xD;
same wide bayou I had swam while " outward&#xD;
bound." I swam it again, and shortly after thought&#xD;
I heai'd a cock crow, but the sound was faint, and it&#xD;
might have been a mockery of the ear. The water&#xD;
receded from my advancing footsteps -now I had&#xD;
left the bogs ,behind me - now I was on dry land&#xD;
&#xD;
that gradually ascended -to the plain, and I knew I&#xD;
was somewhere in the "Great Pine Woods."&#xD;
Just at day-break I came to an opening -a sort of&#xD;
small plantation -but one I had never seen before.&#xD;
In the edge of the woods I came upon two men, a&#xD;
slave and his young master, engaged in catching wild&#xD;
hogs. The white man I knew would demand imy&#xD;
pass, and not able to give him one, would ,take me&#xD;
into possession. I was too wearied to run again, and&#xD;
too desperate to be taken, and therefore adopted a&#xD;
ruse that. proved entirely successful. Assuming a&#xD;
fierce expression, I walked directly towards him, look-&#xD;
ing him steadily in the face. As I approached, he&#xD;
moved backwards with an air of alarm. It was plain&#xD;
he was much affrighted--that he looked upon me as&#xD;
some infernal goblin, just arisen from the bowels of&#xD;
the swamp&#xD;
"Where does William Ford live?" I demanded, in&#xD;
no gentle tone.&#xD;
" He lives seven miles from here," was the reply.&#xD;
" Which is the way to his place ? " I again demand-&#xD;
ed, trying to look more fiercely than ever.&#xD;
"Do you see those pine trees yonder?" he asked,&#xD;
pointing to two, a mile distant, that rose far above&#xD;
their fellows, like a couple of tall sentinels, overlook-&#xD;
ing the broad expanse 'of forest.&#xD;
"I see them," was the answer.&#xD;
"At the feet of those pine trees," he continued,&#xD;
"runs the Texas road. Turn to the left, and it will&#xD;
lead you to William Ford's."&#xD;

&#xD;
TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Without further parley, I hastened forward, happy&#xD;
as he was, no doubt, to place the widest possible dis-&#xD;
tance between us. Striking the Texas road, I turned&#xD;
to the left hand, as directed, and soon passed a great&#xD;
fire, where a pile of logs were burning. I went to it,&#xD;
thinking I would dry my clothes ; but the gray light&#xD;
of the morning was fast breaking away,--some pass-&#xD;
ing white man might observe me ; besides, the heat&#xD;
overpowered me with the desire of sleep : so, linger-&#xD;
ing no longer, I continued my travels, and finally,&#xD;
about eight o'clock, reached the house of Master Ford.&#xD;
The slaves were all absent from the quarters, at&#xD;
their work. Stepping on to the piazza, I knocked at&#xD;
the door, which was soon opened by, Mistress Ford.&#xD;
My appearance was so changed  I was in such a wo-&#xD;
begone and forlorn condition, she did not know me.&#xD;
Inquiring if Master Ford was at home, that good man&#xD;
made his appearance, before the question could be&#xD;
answered. I told him of my flight, and all the par-&#xD;
ticulars connected with it. He listened attentively,&#xD;
and when I had concluded, spoke to me kindly and&#xD;
sympathetically, and taking me to the kitchen, called&#xD;
John, and ordered him to prepare me food. I had&#xD;
tasted nothing since daylight the previous morning.&#xD;
When John had set the meal before me, the madam&#xD;
came out with a bowl of milk, and many little deli-&#xD;
cious dainties, such as rarely please the palate of a&#xD;
slave. I was hungry, and I was weary, but neither&#xD;
food nor rest afforded half the pleasure as did the&#xD;
blessed voices speaking kindness 'and consolation. It&#xD;
&#xD;
FOOD AND REST.&#xD;
&#xD;
145&#xD;
&#xD;
was the oil and the wine which the Good Samaritan&#xD;
in the "Great Pine Woods" was ready to pour into&#xD;
the wounded spirit of the slave, who came 'to him,&#xD;
stripped of his raiment and half-dead.&#xD;
They left me in the cabin, that I might rest. Blessed&#xD;
be sleep ! It visiteth all alike, descending as the dews&#xD;
of heaven on the bond and free. Soon it nestled to my&#xD;
bosom, driving away the troubles that oppressed it, and&#xD;
bearing me to that shadowy region, where I saw again&#xD;
the faces, and listened to the voices of my children,&#xD;
who, alas, for aught I knew in my waking hours, had&#xD;
fallen into the arms of that other sleep, from which&#xD;
they never would arouse.&#xD;

EDWIN EFS.&#xD;
Amtrr   a long sleep, sometime in the afternoon I&#xD;
awoke, refreshed, but very sore and stiff. Sally came&#xD;
in and talked with me, while John cooked me some&#xD;
dinner.   Sally was in great trouble, as well as myself,&#xD;
one of her children being ill, and she feared it could&#xD;
not survive. Dinner over, after walking about the&#xD;
quarters for a while, visiting Sally's cabin and looking&#xD;
at the sick child, I strolled into the madam's garden.&#xD;
Though it was a season of the year when the voices&#xD;
of the birds are silent, and the trees are stripped of&#xD;
their summer glories in more frigid climes, yet the&#xD;
whole variety of roses were then blooming there, and&#xD;
&#xD;
the long, luxuriant vines creeping over the frames.&#xD;
The crimson and golden fruit hung half hidden amidst&#xD;
the younger and older blossoms of the peach, the or-&#xD;
ange, the plum, and the pomegranate; for, in that&#xD;
region of almost perpetual warmth, the leaves are&#xD;
falling and the buds bursting into bloom the whole&#xD;
year long.&#xD;
I indulged the most grateful feelings towards Mas-&#xD;
ter and Mistress Ford, and wishing in some manner&#xD;
to repay their kindness, commenced trimming the&#xD;
vines, and afterwards weeding out the grass from&#xD;
among the orange and pomegranate trees. The latter&#xD;
grows eight or ten feet high, and its fruit, though lar-&#xD;
gcr, is similar in appearance to the jelly-flower. It&#xD;
has the luscious flavor of the strawberry. Oranges,&#xD;
peaches, plums, and most other fruits are indigenous&#xD;
to the rich, warm soil of Avoyelles; but the apple, the&#xD;
most common of them all in colder latitudes, is rare-&#xD;
ly to be seen.&#xD;
Mistress Ford came out presently, saying it was&#xD;
praise-worthy in me, but I was not in a condition to la-&#xD;
bor, and might rest myself at the quarters until mas-&#xD;
ter should go down to Bayou Bocuf; which would not&#xD;
be that day, and it might not be the next. I said to&#xD;
her -to be sure, I felt bad, and was stiff, and that&#xD;
my foot pained me, the stubs- and thorns having so&#xD;
torn it ; but thought such exercise would not hurt&#xD;
me, and that it was , giegat pleasure to work for so&#xD;
good a mistress. Thereupon she returned to the great&#xD;
house, and for three days I was diligent in the garden,&#xD;

148          TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
cleaning the walks, weeding the flower beds, and&#xD;
pulling up the rank grass beneath the jessamine vines,&#xD;
which the gentle and generous hand of my protectress&#xD;
had taught to clamber along the walls.&#xD;
The fourth morning, having become recruited and&#xD;
refreshed, Master Ford ordered me to make ready to&#xD;
accompany him to the bayou. There was but one&#xD;
saddle horse at the opening, all the others with&#xD;
the mules having been sent down to the plantation.&#xD;
I said I could walk, and building Sally and John good-&#xD;
bye, left the opening, trotting along by the horse's&#xD;
side.&#xD;
That little paradise in the Great Pine Woods was&#xD;
the oasis in the desert, towards which my heart turn-&#xD;
ed lovingly, during many years of bondage. I went&#xD;
forth from it now with regret and sorrow, not so over-&#xD;
whelming, however, as if it had then been given me&#xD;
to know that I should never return to it again.&#xD;
Master Ford urged me to take his place occasion-&#xD;
ally on the horse, to rest me ; but I said no, I was not&#xD;
tired,.and it was better for me to walk thanhim. He&#xD;
said many kind and cheering things to me on the way,&#xD;
riding slowly, in order that I might keep pace with&#xD;
him. The goodness of God was manifest, he declared,&#xD;
in my miraculous escape from the swamp. As Da-.&#xD;
iel came forth unharmed from the den of lions, and&#xD;
as Jonah had been preserved in the whale's belly,&#xD;
even so had I been deliveredfrom evil by the Al-&#xD;
mighty. He interrogated rite' regard to the various&#xD;
fears and emotions I had experienced during the day&#xD;
&#xD;
FORD'S REIARXs ON THE WAY.      149&#xD;
and night, and if I had felt, at any time, a desire to&#xD;
pray. I felt forsaken of the whole world, I answered&#xD;
him, and was praying mentally all the while. At&#xD;
such times, said he, the heart of man turns instinct-&#xD;
ively towards his Maker. In prosperity, and when,&#xD;
there is nothing to injure or make him afraid, he re-&#xD;
members Him not, and is ready to defy Him; but&#xD;
place him in the midst of dangers, cut him off from&#xD;
human aid, let the grave open before him -then it&#xD;
is, in the time of his tribulation, that the scoffer and&#xD;
unbelieving man turns to God for help, feeling there&#xD;
is no other hope, o- refuge, or safety, save in his pro-&#xD;
tecting arm.&#xD;
So did that benignant man speak to me of this life&#xD;
and of the life hereafter; of the goodness and power&#xD;
of God, and of the vanity of earthly things, as we'&#xD;
journeyed along the solitary road towards Bayou&#xD;
Bceuf.&#xD;
When within some five miles of the plantation, we&#xD;
discovered a horseman at a distance, galloping tow-&#xD;
ards us. As he came near I saw that it was Tibeats!&#xD;
He looked at me a moment, but did not address'me,&#xD;
and turning about, rode along side by side with Ford.&#xD;
I trotted silently at their horses' heels, listing to their&#xD;
conversation. Ford informed him of my arrival in&#xD;
the Pine Woods three days before, of the sad plight I&#xD;
was in, and of the difficulties and dangers I, had en-&#xD;
countered.&#xD;
" Well," exclaimedTibeats, omitting his usual oaths&#xD;
in the presence of Ford, "I never saw such running&#xD;

&#xD;
before. I'll bet him against a hundred dollars, he'll&#xD;
beat any nigger in Louisiana. I offered John David&#xD;
Cheney twenty-five dollars to catch him, dead or alive,&#xD;
but he outran his dogs in a fair race. Them Cheney&#xD;
dogs ain't much, after all. Dunwoodie's hounds&#xD;
would have had him down before he touched the pal-,&#xD;
mettoes. Somehow the dogs got off the track, and we&#xD;
had to give up the hunt. We rode the horses as far.&#xD;
as we could, and then kept on foot till the water was&#xD;
three feet deep. The boys said he was drowned, sure.&#xD;
I allow I wanted a shot at him mightily. Ever since,&#xD;
I have been riding up and down the bayou, but had'nt&#xD;
much hope of catching him -thought he was dead,&#xD;
sartmn. Oh, he's a cuss to run -that nigger is !"&#xD;
In this way Tibeats ran on, describing his search in&#xD;
the swamp, the wonderful speed with which I had&#xD;
fled before the hounds, and when he had finished,&#xD;
Master Ford responded by saying, I had always been&#xD;
a willing and faithful boy with him; that he was sor-&#xD;
ry we had such trouble ; that, according to Platt's&#xD;
story, he had been inhumanly treated, and that he,&#xD;
Tibeats, was himself in fault. Using hatchets and&#xD;
broad-axes upon slaves was shameful, and should not&#xD;
be allowed, he remarked. "This is no way of dealing&#xD;
with them, when first brought into the country. It&#xD;
will have a pernicious influence, and set them all run-&#xD;
ning away. The swamps will be full of them. A lit.&#xD;
tle kindness would be far more effectual in restraining&#xD;
them, and rendering them obedient, than the use of&#xD;
such deadly weapons. Every planter on the bayou&#xD;
&#xD;
ot&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
FORD CENSURES TIBEATS.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
should frown upon such inhumanity. It is for the in-&#xD;
terest of all to do so. It is evident enough, Mr. Tib-&#xD;
eats, that you and Platt cannot live together. You&#xD;
dislike him, and would not hesitate to kill him, and&#xD;
knowing it, he will run from you again through fear&#xD;
of his life. Now, Tibeats, you must sell him, or hire&#xD;
him out, at least. Unless you do so, I shall take&#xD;
measures to get him out of your possession."&#xD;
In this spirit Ford addressed him the remainder of&#xD;
the distance. I opened not my mouth. On reaching&#xD;
the plantation they entered the great house, while I&#xD;
repaired to Eliza's cabin. The slaves were astonish-&#xD;
ed to find me there, on returning from the field, sup-&#xD;
posing I was drowned.. That night, again, they gath-&#xD;
ered about the cabin to listen to the story of my&#xD;
adventure. They took it for granted I would be whip-&#xD;
ped, and that it would be severe, the well-known pen-&#xD;
alty of running away being five hundred lashes.&#xD;
"Poor. fellow," said Eliza, taking me by the hand,&#xD;
"it would have been better for you if you had drown-&#xD;
ed. You have a cruel master, and he will kill you&#xD;
yet, I am afraid."&#xD;
Lawson suggested that it might be, overseer Cha-&#xD;
pin would be appointed to inflict the punishment, in&#xD;
which case it would not be severe, whereupon Mary,&#xD;
Rachel, Bristol, and others hoped it would be Master&#xD;
Ford, and then it would be no whipping at all. They&#xD;
all pitied me and tried to console me, and were sad in&#xD;
view of the castigation that awaited me, except Ken-&#xD;
tucky John. There were no bounds to his laughter;&#xD;

&#xD;
he filled the cabin with cachinnations, holding his sides&#xD;
to prevent an explosion, and the cause of his noisy&#xD;
mirth was the idea of my outstripping the hounds.&#xD;
Somehow, he looked at the subject in a comical light.&#xD;
"I know'd dey would'nt cotch him, when he run crossdee&#xD;
de plantation. 0, de lpr', did'nt Platt pick his feet&#xD;
right up, tho', hey? When dem dogs got whar he&#xD;
was, he was'nt dar - haw, haw, haw ! O, de lor' a'&#xD;
mity !"  and then Kentucky John relapsed into an-&#xD;
other of his boisterous fits.&#xD;
Early the next morning, Tibeats left the plantation.&#xD;
In the course of the forenoon, while sauntering about&#xD;
the gin-house, a tall, good-looking man came to me,&#xD;
and inquired if I was Tibeats' boy, that youthful ap-&#xD;
pellation being applied indiscriminately to slaves&#xD;
even though they may have passed the number of&#xD;
three score years and ten. I took off my hat, and an-&#xD;
swered that I was.&#xD;
"How would you like to work for me ?" he in-&#xD;
quired.&#xD;
" Oh, I would like to, very much," said I, inspired'&#xD;
with a sudden hope of getting away from Tibeats.&#xD;
"You worked under Myers at Peter Tanner's, didn't&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
I replied I had, adding some complimentary re-&#xD;
marks that Myers had made concerning me.&#xD;
" Well, boy," said he, "I have hired you of your&#xD;
master to work for me in the " Big Cane Brake,"&#xD;
thirty-eight miles from here, down on Red River."&#xD;
This man was Mr. Eldret, who lived below Ford's,&#xD;
&#xD;
on the same side of the bayou. I accompanied him&#xD;
to his plantation, and in the morning started with his&#xD;
slave Sam, and a wagon-load of provisions, drawn by&#xD;
four mules, for the Big Cane, Eldret and Myers hav-&#xD;
ing preceded us on horseback. This Sam wasa na-&#xD;
tive of Charleston, where he had a mother, brother&#xD;
and sisters. le "allowed "-= a common word among&#xD;
both black and white - that Tibeats was a mean man,&#xD;
and hoped, as I most earnestly did also, that his mas-&#xD;
ter would buy me.&#xD;
We proceeded down the south shore of the bayou,&#xD;
crossing it.at Carey's plantation; from thence td Huff&#xD;
Power, passing which, we came upon the Bayou&#xD;
Rouge road, which runs towards Red River. After&#xD;
passing through Bayou Rouge Swamp, and just at&#xD;
sunset, turning from the highway, we sti ack off into&#xD;
the " Big Cane Brake." We followed an unbeaten&#xD;
track, scarcely wide enough to admit the wagon.&#xD;
The' cane, such as are used for fishing-rods, were as&#xD;
thick as they could stand. A person could not be&#xD;
seen through them the distance of a rod. The paths&#xD;
of wild beasts run through them in various directions&#xD;
- the bear and the American tiger abounding in these&#xD;
brakes, and wherever there is a basin of stagnant wa-&#xD;
ter, it is full of alligators.&#xD;
We kept on our lonely course through the "Big&#xD;
Cane" several miles, when we entered a clearing,&#xD;
known as "Sutton's Field."  Many .years before, a&#xD;
man by the name of Sutton had penetrated the wilder-&#xD;
ness of cane to this solitary place. Tradition has it,&#xD;

that he fled thither, a fugitive, not from service, but&#xD;
from justice. Here he lived alone -recluse and her-&#xD;
mit of the swamp - with his own hands planting the&#xD;
seed and gathering in the harvest. One day a band&#xD;
of Indians stole upon his solitude, and after a bloody&#xD;
battle, overpowered and massacred him. For miles&#xD;
the country round, in the slaves' quarters, and on the&#xD;
piazzas of "great houses," where white children listen&#xD;
to superstitious tales, the story goes, that that spot, in&#xD;
the heart of the "Big Cane," is a haunted place. For&#xD;
more than a quarter of a century, human voices had&#xD;
rarely, if ever, disturbed the silence of the clearing.&#xD;
Rank and noxious weeds had overspread the once cul-&#xD;
tivated field- serpents sunned themselves on the door-&#xD;
way of the crumbling cabin. It was indeed a dreary&#xD;
picture of desolation.&#xD;
Passing "Sutton's Field," we followed a new-cut&#xD;
road two miles farther, which brought us to its ter-&#xD;
mination. We had now reached the wild lands of&#xD;
Mr. Eldret, where he contemplated clearing up an&#xD;
extensive plantation. We went to work next morn-&#xD;
ing with our cane-knives, and cleared a sufficient&#xD;
space to allow the erection of two cabins - one for&#xD;
Myers and Eldret, the other for Sam, myself,and the&#xD;
slaves that were to join us. We were now in the&#xD;
midst of trees of enormous growth, whose wide-spread-&#xD;
ing branches almost shut out the light of the sun,&#xD;
while the space between the trunks was an impervi-&#xD;
ous mass of cane, with here and there an occasional'&#xD;
palmetto.&#xD;
&#xD;
The bay and the sycamore, the oak and the cypress,&#xD;
reach a growth unparalleled, in those fertile lowlands&#xD;
bordering the Red River. From every tree, moreover,&#xD;
hang long, large masses of moss, presenting to the eye&#xD;
unaccustomed to them, a striking and singular appear-&#xD;
ance. This moss, in large quantities, is sent north,&#xD;
and there used for manufacturing purposes.&#xD;
We cut down oaks, split them into rails, and with&#xD;
these erected temporary cabins. We covered the&#xD;
roofs with"'the broad palmetto leaf, an excellent sub-&#xD;
stitute for shingles, as long as they last.&#xD;
The greatest annoyance I met with here were small&#xD;
flies, gnats and mosquitoes. They swarmed the air.&#xD;
They penetrated the porches of the ear, the nose, the&#xD;
eyes, the mouth. They sucked themselves beneath&#xD;
the skin. It was impossible to brush or beat them&#xD;
off. It seemed, indeed, as if they would devour Us.-&#xD;
carry us away piecemeal, in their small tormenting&#xD;
mouths.&#xD;
A lonelier spot, or one more disagreeable, than the&#xD;
centre of the "Big Cane Brake," it would be difficult&#xD;
to conceive; yet to me it was a paradise, in compari-&#xD;
son with any other place in the company of Master&#xD;
Tibeats. I labored hard, and oft-times was weary and&#xD;
fatigued, yet I could lie down at night in peace, and&#xD;
arise in the morning without fear.&#xD;
In the course of a fortnight, four black girls came&#xD;
down from Eldret's plantation -Charlotte, Fanny,&#xD;
Cresia and Nelly. They were all large and stout.&#xD;
Axes were put into their hands, and they were sent&#xD;

out with Sam and myself to cut trees. They'-were&#xD;
excellent choppers, the largest oak or sycamore stand-&#xD;
ing but a brief season before their heavy and well-&#xD;
directed blows. At piling logs, they were equal to&#xD;
any man. There are lumberwomen as well as lum-&#xD;
bermen in the forests of the South. In fact, in the&#xD;
region of the Bayou Boeuf they perform their share of&#xD;
all the labor required on the plantation. They plough,&#xD;
drag, drive team, clear wild lands, work on the high-&#xD;
way, and so forth. Some planters, owning large cot-&#xD;
ton and sugar plantations, have none other than the&#xD;
labor of slave women. Such an one is Jim Burns,&#xD;
who lives on the north shore of the bayou, opposite&#xD;
the plantation of John Fogaman.&#xD;
On our arrival in the brake, Eldret promised me,&#xD;
if I worked well, I might go up to visit my friends at&#xD;
Ford's in four weeks. On Saturday night of the fifth&#xD;
week, I reminded him of his promise, when he told&#xD;
me I had done so well, that I might go. I had set&#xD;
my heart upon it, and Eldret's announcement thrilled&#xD;
me with pleasure. I was to return in time to com-&#xD;
mence the labors of the day on Tuesday morning.&#xD;
While indulging the pleasant anticipation of so soon&#xD;
meeting my old friends again, suddenly the hateful&#xD;
form of Tibeats appeared among us. He inquired&#xD;
how Myers and Platt got along together, and was&#xD;
told, very well, and that Platt was going up to Ford's.&#xD;
plantation in the morning on a visit.&#xD;
"Poh, poh!"sneered Tibeats; "it isn't worth while&#xD;
the nigger will get unsteady. He can't go."&#xD;

&#xD;
But Eldret insisted I had worked faithfully -that&#xD;
he had given me his promise, and that, under the cir-&#xD;
cumstances, I ought not to be disappointed. They&#xD;
then, it being about dark, entered one cabin and I&#xD;
the other. I could not give up the idea of going ; it&#xD;
was a sore disappointment. Before morning I resolved,&#xD;
if Eldret made no objection, to leave at all hazards.&#xD;
At daylight I was at his door, with my blanket rolled&#xD;
up into a bundle, and hanging on a stick over my&#xD;
shoulder, waiting for apass. Tibeats came out pre-&#xD;
sently in one of his disagreeable moods, washed his&#xD;
face, and going to a stump near by, sat down upon it,&#xD;
apparently busily thinking with himself. After stand-&#xD;
ing there a long time, impelled by a sudden impulse&#xD;
of impatience, I started off.&#xD;
"Are you going without a pass ? " he cried out&#xD;
to me.&#xD;
"Yes, master, I thought I would," I answered.&#xD;
"How do you think you'll get there-? " demanded&#xD;
.he.&#xD;
" Don't know," was all the reply I made him.&#xD;
"You'd be taken and sent to jail, where you ought&#xD;
to be, before you got half-way there," he added, pass-&#xD;
ing into the cabin as he said it. He came out soon&#xD;
with the pass in his hand, and calling me a "d-d nig-&#xD;
ger that deserved a hundred lashes," threw it on the&#xD;
ground. I picked it up,' and hurried away right&#xD;
speedily.&#xD;

whom he meets. The one I now received was dated,&#xD;
and read as follows:&#xD;
"Platt has permission to go to Ford's plantation,&#xD;
on Bayou Boeuf, and return by Tuesday morning.&#xD;
JoHN M. TIBEATs."&#xD;
This is the usual form. On the way, a great many&#xD;
demanded it, read it, and passed on. Those having&#xD;
the air and appearance of gentlemen, whose dress&#xD;
indicated the possession of wealth, frequently took no&#xD;
notice of me whatever ; but a shabby fellow, an un-&#xD;
mistakable loafer, never failed to hail me, and to&#xD;
scrutinize and examine me in the most thorough man-&#xD;
ner. Catching runaways is sometimes a money-mak-&#xD;
ing business. If, after advertising, no owner appears,&#xD;
they may be sold to the highest bidder ; and certain&#xD;
fees are allowed the finder for his services, at all&#xD;
events, even if reclaimed. "A mean white," there-&#xD;
fore,- a name applied to the species loafer  con-&#xD;
siders it a god-send to meet an unknown negro with-&#xD;
out a pass.&#xD;
There are no inns along the highways in that por-&#xD;
tion of the State where I sojourned. I was wholly&#xD;
destitute of money, neither did I carry any provisions,&#xD;
on my journey from the Big Cane to Bayou Bceuf;&#xD;
nevertheless, with his pass in his hand, a slave need&#xD;
never suffer from hunger or from thirst. It is only&#xD;
necessary to present it to the master or overseer of a&#xD;
plantation, and state his wants, when he will be sent&#xD;
round to the kitchen and provided with food or shel-&#xD;
ter, as the case may require. The traveler stops at&#xD;
&#xD;
any house and calls for a meal with as much freedom&#xD;
as if it was a public tavern. It is the general custom&#xD;
of the country. Whatever their faults may be, it is&#xD;
certain the inhabitants along Red River, and around&#xD;
the bayous in the interior of Louisiana are not want-&#xD;
ing in hospitality.&#xD;
I arrived at Ford's plantation towards the close of&#xD;
the afternoon, passing the evening in Eliza's cabin,&#xD;
with Lawson, Rachel, and others of my acquaintance.&#xD;
When we left Washington Eliza's form was round and&#xD;
plump. She stood erect, and in her silks and jewels,&#xD;
presented a picture of graceful strength and elegance.&#xD;
Now she was but a thin shadow'of her former self.&#xD;
I-Ier face had become ghastly haggard, and the once&#xD;
straight and active form was bowed down, as if bear-&#xD;
ing the weight of a hundred years. Crouching on her&#xD;
cabin floor, and clad in the coarse garments of a slave,&#xD;
old Elisha Berry would not have recognized the moth-&#xD;
er of his child. I never saw her afterwards. Having&#xD;
become useless in the cotton-field, she was bartered&#xD;
for a trifle, to some man residing in the vicinity of&#xD;
Peter Compton's. Grief had gnawed remorselessly at&#xD;
her heart, until her strength was gone ; and for that,&#xD;
her last master, it is said, lashed and abused her most&#xD;
unmercifully. But he could not whip back the de-&#xD;
parted vigor of her youth, nor straighten up that bend-&#xD;
ed body to its full height, such as it was when her&#xD;
children were around her, and the light of freedom&#xD;
was shining on her path.&#xD;
I learned the particulars relative to her departure&#xD;
&#xD;

sALE TO EDWIN EPPs.           1G1&#xD;
&#xD;
from this work, from some of Compton's slaves, who&#xD;
had come over Red River to the bayou, to assist&#xD;
young Madam    Tanner during the "busy season."&#xD;
She became at length, they said, utterly helpless, for&#xD;
several weeks lying on the ground floor in a dilapida-&#xD;
ted cabin, dependent upon the mercy of her fellow-&#xD;
thralls for an occasional drop of water, and a morsel&#xD;
of food. Her master did not "'knock her on the&#xD;
head," as is sometimes done to put a suffering animal&#xD;
out of misery, but left her unprovided for, and unpro-&#xD;
tected, to linger through a life of pain and wretched-&#xD;
ness to its natural close. When the hands returned&#xD;
from the field one night they found her dead ! Du-&#xD;
ring the day, the Angel of the Lord, who moveth in-&#xD;
visibly over all the earth, gathering in his harvest of&#xD;
departing souls, had silently entered the cabin of the&#xD;
dying woman, and taken her from thence. She was&#xD;
free at last !&#xD;
Next day, rolling up my blanket, I started on my&#xD;
return to the Big Cane. After traveling five miles,&#xD;
at a place called Huff Power, the ever-present Tibe-&#xD;
ats met me in the road. He inquired why I was go-&#xD;
ing back so soon, and when informed I was anxious&#xD;
to return by the time I was directed, he said I need&#xD;
go no farther than the next plantation, as he had that&#xD;
day sold me to Edwin Epps. We walked down into&#xD;
the yard, where we met the latter gentleman, who ex-&#xD;
amined me, and asked me the usual questions pro-&#xD;
pounded by purchasers. Having been duly delivered&#xD;
over, I was ordered to the quarters, and at the same&#xD;
&#xD;
time directed to make a hoe and axe handle for my-&#xD;
self.&#xD;
I was now no longer the property of Tibeats - his&#xD;
dog,, his brute, dreading his wrath and cruelty day&#xD;
and night ; and whoever or whatever my new master&#xD;
might prove to be, I could not, certainly, regret the&#xD;
change. So it was good news when the sale was an-&#xD;
nounced, and with a sigh of relief I sat down for the&#xD;
first time in my new abode.&#xD;
Tibeats soon after disappeared from that section of&#xD;
the country. Once afterwards, and only once, I&#xD;
caught a glimpse of him. It was many miles from&#xD;
Bayou Bouf. He was seated in the doorway of a&#xD;
low groggery. I was passing, in a drove of slaves,&#xD;
through St. Mary's parish.&#xD;

whole weeks. Latterly, however, he had reformed&#xD;
his habits, and when I left him, was as strict a speci-&#xD;
men of temperance as could be found on Bayou&#xD;
Bocuf. When "in his cups," Master Epps was a roys-&#xD;
tering, blustering, noisy fellow, whose chief delight&#xD;
was in dancing with his "niggers," or lashing them&#xD;
about the yard with his long whip, just for the pleas-&#xD;
ure of hearing them screech and scream, as the great&#xD;
welts were planted on their backs. When sober, he&#xD;
was silent, reserved and cunning, not beating us in-&#xD;
discriminately, as in his drunken moments, but senc-&#xD;
ing the end of his rawhide to some tender spot of a&#xD;
lagging slave, with a sly dexterity peculiar to himself.&#xD;
He had been a driver and overseer in his younger&#xD;
years, but at this time was in possession of a planta-&#xD;
tion on Bayou Huff Power, two and -a half miles from&#xD;
Holmesville, eighteen from Marksville, and twelve&#xD;
from Cheneyville. It belonged to Joseph B. Roberts,&#xD;
his wife's uncle, and was leased by Epps. His prin-&#xD;
cipal business was raising cotton, and inasmuch as&#xD;
some may read this book who have never seen a cot-&#xD;
ton field, a description of the manner of its culture&#xD;
may not be out of place.&#xD;
The ground is prepared by throwing up beds or&#xD;
ridges, with the plough-back-furrowing, it is called.&#xD;
Oxen and mules, the latter almost exclusively, are&#xD;
used in ploughing. The women as frequently as the&#xD;
men perform this labor, feeding, currying, and ta-&#xD;

field and stable work, precisely as do the ploughboys&#xD;
of the North.&#xD;
The beds, or ridges, are six feet wide, that is, from&#xD;
water furrow to water furrow. A plough drawn by.&#xD;
one mule is then run along the top of the ridge or&#xD;
center of the bed, making the drill, into- which a girl&#xD;
usually drops the seed, which she carries in a bag&#xD;
hung round her neck. Behind her comes a mule&#xD;
and harrow, covering up the seed, so that two mules,&#xD;
three slaves, a plough and harrow, are employed&#xD;
in planting a row of cotton. This is done in the&#xD;
months of March and April. Corn is planted in Feb-&#xD;
ruary. When there are no.cold rains, the cotton usu-&#xD;
ally makes its appearance in a week. In the course&#xD;
of eight or ten days afterwards the first hoeing is&#xD;
commended. This is performfFin part, also, by the&#xD;
aid of the plough and mule. The plough passes as&#xD;
near as possible to the cotton on both sides, throw-&#xD;
ing the furrow from it. Slaves follow with their hoes,&#xD;
cutting up the grass and cotton, leaving hills two feet&#xD;
and a half apart. This is called scraping cotton. In&#xD;
two weeks more commences the second hoeing.&#xD;
This time the furrow is thrown towards the cotton.&#xD;
Only one stalk, the largest, is now left standing in&#xD;
each hill.. In another fortnight it is hoed the third&#xD;
time, throwing the furrow towards the cotton in the&#xD;
same manner as before, and killing all the grass be-&#xD;
tween the rows. About the first of July, when it is_&#xD;
a foot high or thereabouts, it is hoed the fourth and&#xD;
last time. Now the whole space between the rows&#xD;
&#xD;
:p&#xD;
&#xD;
is ploughed, leaving a deep water furrow in the center.&#xD;
During all these hoeings the overseer or driver&#xD;
follows the slaves on horseback with a whip, such as&#xD;
has been described. The fastest hoer takes the lead&#xD;
row. He is usually about a rod in advance of his&#xD;
companions. If one of them passes him, he is whip-&#xD;
ped. If one falls behind or is a moment idle, he is&#xD;
whipped. In fact, the lash is flying from morning&#xD;
until night, the whole day long. The hoeing season&#xD;
thus continues from April until July, a field having&#xD;
no sooner been finished once, than itis commenced&#xD;
again.&#xD;
In the latter part of August begins the cotton pick-&#xD;
ing season. At this time each slave is presented&#xD;
with a sack. A'strap is fastened to it, which goes&#xD;
over the neck, holding the mouth of the sack breast&#xD;
high, while the bottom reaches nearly to the ground.&#xD;
Each'one is also presented with a large basket that&#xD;
will hold about two barrels. This is to put the cotton&#xD;
in when the sack is filled. The baskets are carried&#xD;
to the field and placed at the beginning of the rows.&#xD;
When a new hand, one unaccustomed to the busi-&#xD;
ness, is sent for the first time into the field, he.is&#xD;
whipped up smartly, and made for that day to pick&#xD;
as fast as he can possibly. At night it is weighed,&#xD;
so that his capability in cotton picking is known.&#xD;
He must bring in the same weight each night follow-&#xD;
ing. If it falls short, it is considered evidence that&#xD;
lie has been laggard, and a greater or less number&#xD;
of lashes is the penalty.&#xD;

COTTON PICKING.&#xD;
&#xD;
167&#xD;
&#xD;
An ordinary day's work is two hundred pounds.&#xD;
A slave who is accustomed to picking, is punished,&#xD;
if he or she brings in a less quantity than that.&#xD;
There is a great difference among them as regards&#xD;
this kind of labor. Some of them seem to have a&#xD;
natural knack, or quickness, which enables them to&#xD;
pick with great celerity, and with both hands, while&#xD;
others, with whatever practice or industry, are utterly&#xD;
unable to come up to the ordinary standard. Such&#xD;
hands are taken from the cotton field and employed&#xD;
in other business. Patsey, of whom I shall have&#xD;
more to say, was known as the most remarkable cot-&#xD;
ton picker on Bayou Bouf. She picked with both&#xD;
hands and with such surprising rapidity, that five&#xD;
hundred pounds a day was not unusual for her.&#xD;
Each one is tasked, therefore, according to his&#xD;
picking abilities, none, however, to come short of two&#xD;
hundred weight. I, being unskillful always in that&#xD;
business, would have satisfied my master by bringing&#xD;
in the latter quantity, while on the other hand, Pat-&#xD;
sey would surely have been beaten if she failed to&#xD;
produce twice as much.&#xD;
The cotton grows from five to seven feet high, each&#xD;
stalk having a great many branches, shooting out ii&#xD;
all directions, and lapping each other above the wa-&#xD;
ter furrow.&#xD;
There are few sights more pleasant to the eye,&#xD;
than a wide cotton field when it is in the bloom. It&#xD;
presents an appearance of purity, like an immaculate&#xD;
expanse of light, new-fallen snow.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sometimes the slave picks down one side of a row,&#xD;
and back upon the other, but more usually, there is&#xD;
one on either side, gathering all that has blossomed,&#xD;
leaving the unopened bolls for a succeeding picking.&#xD;
When the sack is filled, it is emptied into the basket and&#xD;
trodden down. It is necessary to be extremely care-&#xD;
fal the first time going through the field, in' order not&#xD;
to break. the branches off the stalks. The cotton&#xD;
will not bloom upon a broken branch. Epps never&#xD;
failed to inflict the severest chastisement on the un-&#xD;
lucky servant who, either carelessly or unavoidably,&#xD;
was guilty in the least degree in this respect.&#xD;
The hands are required to be in the cotton field as&#xD;
soon as it is light in the morning, and, with the, ex-&#xD;
ception of ten or fifteen minutes, which is given them&#xD;
at noon to swallow their allowance of cold bacon,&#xD;
they are not permitted to be a moment idle until it&#xD;
7       is too dark to see, and when the moon is full, they&#xD;
often times labor till the middle of the night. They&#xD;
do not dare to stop even at dinner time, nor return&#xD;
to the quarters, however late it be, until the order to&#xD;
halt is given by the driver.&#xD;
The day's work over in the field, the baskets are&#xD;
"toted," or in other words, carried to the gin-house,&#xD;
where the cotton is weighed. No matter how fa-&#xD;

suffer. And if he has exceeded it by ten or twenty&#xD;
pounds, in all probability his master will measure the&#xD;
next day's task accordingly. So, whether he has too&#xD;
little or too much, his approach to the gin-house is&#xD;
always with fear and trembling. Most frequently&#xD;
they have too little, and therefore it is they are not&#xD;
anxious to leave the field. After weighing, follow the&#xD;
whippings ; and then the baskets are carried to the&#xD;
cotton house, and their contents stored away like hay,&#xD;
all hands being sent in to tramp it down. If the cot-&#xD;
ton is not dry, instead of taking it to the gin-house&#xD;
at once, it is laid upon platforms, two feet high, and&#xD;
some three times as wide, covered with boards or&#xD;
plank, with narrow walks running between them.&#xD;
This done, the labor of the day is not yet ended, by&#xD;
any means. Each one must then attend to his re-&#xD;
spective chores. One feeds the mules, another the&#xD;
swine -another cuts the wood, and so forth; besides,&#xD;
the packing is all done by candle light. Finally, at&#xD;
a late hour, they reach the quarters, sleepy and over-&#xD;
come with the long day's toil. Then a fire must be&#xD;
kindled in the cabin; the corn ground in the small&#xD;
hand-mill, and supper, and dinner for the next day in&#xD;
the field, prepared. All that is allowed them is corn&#xD;
and bacon, which is given out at the corncrib and&#xD;
smoke-house every Sunday morning. Each one re-&#xD;
ceives, as his weekly allowance, three and a half&#xD;
pounds of bacon, and corn enough to make a peck of&#xD;
meal. That is all- no tea, coffee, sugar, and with&#xD;
the exception of a very scanty sprinkling now and&#xD;
&#xD;
then, no salt. I can say, from a ten years' residence&#xD;
with Master Epps, that no slave of his is ever likely&#xD;
to suffer from the gout, superinduced by excessive&#xD;
high living. Master Epps' hogs were fed on sheled&#xD;
corn -it was thrown out to his "niggers" in the&#xD;
ear. The former, he thought, would fatten faster by&#xD;
shelling, and soaking it in the water - the latter,&#xD;
perhaps, if treated in the same manner, might grow&#xD;
too fat to labor. Master Epps was a shrewd cal-&#xD;
culator, and knew how to manage his own animals,&#xD;
drunk or sober.&#xD;
The corn mill stands in the yard beneath a shelter.&#xD;
It is like a common coffee mill, the hopper holding&#xD;
about six quarts. There was one privilege which&#xD;
Master Epps granted freely to every slave he had.&#xD;
They might grind their corn nightly, in such small&#xD;
quantities as their daily wants required, or they&#xD;
might grind the whole week's allowance at one time,&#xD;
on Sundays, just as they preferred. A very gener-&#xD;
ous man was Master Epps !&#xD;
I kept my corn in a small wooden box, the meal in&#xD;
a gourd; and, by the way, the gourd- is one of the&#xD;
most convenient and necessary utensils on a planta-&#xD;
tion. Besides supplying the place of all kinds of&#xD;
crockery in a slave cabin, it is used for carrying&#xD;
water to the fields. Another, also, contains the din-&#xD;
ner. It dispenses with the necessity of pails, dippers,&#xD;
basins, and such tin and wooden superfluities alto-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;

bacon is taken down from the nail on which it hangs,&#xD;
a slice cut off and thrown upon the coals ° to broil.&#xD;
The majority of slaves have no knife, much less a&#xD;
fork. They cut their bacon with the axe at the wood-&#xD;
pile. The corn meal is mixed with a little water,&#xD;
placed in the fire, and baked. When it is "done&#xD;
brown," the ashes are scraped off, and being placed&#xD;
upon a chip, which answers for a table, the tenant of&#xD;
the slave hut is ready to sit down upon the ground to&#xD;
supper. By this time it is usually midnight. The&#xD;
same fear of punishment with which they approach&#xD;
the gin-house, possesses them again on lying down to&#xD;
get a snatch of rest. It is the fear of oversleeping in&#xD;
the morning. Such an offence would certainly be&#xD;
attended with not less than twenty lashes. With a&#xD;
prayer that he may be on his feet and wide awake at&#xD;
the first sound of the horn, he sinks to his slumbers&#xD;
nightly.&#xD;
The softest couches in the world are not to be found&#xD;
in the log mansion of the slave. The one whereon I&#xD;
reclined year after year, was a plank twelve inches&#xD;
wide and ten feet long. My pillow was a stick of&#xD;
wood. The bedding was a coarse blanket, and not a&#xD;
rag or shred beside. Moss might be used, were it not.&#xD;
that it directly breeds a swarm of fleas.&#xD;
The cabin is constructed of logs, without floor or&#xD;
window. The latter is altogether unnecessary, the&#xD;
crevices between the logs admitting sufficient light.&#xD;
In stormy weather the rain drives through them,&#xD;
rendering it comfortless and extremely dsagrGeable.&#xD;

The rude door hangs on great wooden hinges. In one&#xD;
end is constructed an awkward fire-place.&#xD;
An hour \before day light the horn is blown. Then&#xD;
the slaves arouse, prepare their breakfast, fill a gourd&#xD;
with water, in another deposit their dinner of cold&#xD;
bacon and corn cake, and hurry to the field again.&#xD;
It is an offence invariably followed by a flogging, to&#xD;
be found at the quarters aftei: daybreak. Then the&#xD;
fears and labors of another day begin; and until its&#xD;
close there is no such thing as rest. He fears he will&#xD;
be caught lagging through the day; he fears to&#xD;
approach the gin-house with his basket-load of cotton&#xD;
at night; he fears, when he lies down, that he will&#xD;
oversleep himself in the morning. Such is a true,&#xD;
faithful, unexaggerated picture and description of&#xD;
the slave's daily life, during the time of cotton-pick-&#xD;
ing, on the shores of Bayou Bceuf.&#xD;
In the month of January; generally, the fourth and&#xD;
last*picking is completed. Then commences the har-&#xD;
vesting. of corn. This is considered a secondary crop,&#xD;
and receives far less attention than the cotton. It is&#xD;
planted, as already mentioned, in February.. Corn is&#xD;
grown in thatregion for the purpose of fattening&#xD;
hogs and feeding slaves ; very little, if any, being sent&#xD;
to market. It is the white variety, the ear of great&#xD;
size, and the stalk growing 'to the height of eight,&#xD;
and often times ten feet. In August the leaves are'&#xD;
stripped off, dried in the sun, bound in small bundles,&#xD;
and stored away as provender for the mules and oxen.&#xD;
After this the slaves go through the field, :turning&#xD;

dpwn the ear, for the purpose of keeping the rains&#xD;
from penetrating to the grain. It is left in this condi-&#xD;
tion until after cotton-picking is over, whether earlier&#xD;
or later. Then the ears are separated from the stalks,&#xD;
and deposited in the corncrib with the husks on;&#xD;
otherwise, stripped of the husks, the weevil would&#xD;
destroy it. The stalks are left standing in the field.&#xD;
The Carolina, or sweet potato, is also grown in that&#xD;
region to some extent. They are not fed, however,&#xD;
to hogs or cattle, and are considered but of small in-&#xD;
portance. They are preserved by placing them upon&#xD;
the surface of the ground, with a slight covering of&#xD;
earth or cornstalks. There is not a cellar on Bayou&#xD;
Bouf. The ground is so low it would fill with water.&#xD;
Potatoes are worth from two to three "bits," or&#xD;
shillings a barrel; corn, except when there is an&#xD;
unusual scarcity, can be purchased at the same rate.&#xD;
As soon as the cotton and corn crops are secured,&#xD;
the stalks are pulled up, thrown into piles and burned.&#xD;
The ploughs are started at the same time, throwing&#xD;
up the beds again, preparatory to another planting.&#xD;
The soil, in the 'parishes of Rapides and Avoyelles,&#xD;
and throughout the whole country, so far as my obser-&#xD;
vation extended, is of exceeding richness and fe-rtility.&#xD;
It is a kind of marl, of a brown or reddish color. It&#xD;
does not require those invigorating composts neces-&#xD;
sary to more barren lands, and on the same field the&#xD;
same crop is grown for many successive years.&#xD;
Ploughing, planting, picking cotton, gathering the&#xD;
corn, and pulling and burning 'stalks, occupies the&#xD;
&#xD;
whole of the four seasons of the year. Drawing and&#xD;
cutting wood, pressing cotton, fattening and killing&#xD;
hogs, are but incidental labors.&#xD;
In the month of September or October, the hogs&#xD;
are run out of the swamps by dogs, and confined in&#xD;
pens. On a cold morning, generally about New&#xD;
Year's day, they are slaughtered. Each carcass is&#xD;
cut into six parts, and piled one-above the other in&#xD;
salt, upon large tables in the smoke-house. In this&#xD;
condition it remains a fortnight, when it is hung up,&#xD;
and a fire built, and continued more than half the&#xD;
time during the remainder of the year. This thorough&#xD;
smoking is necessary to prevent the bacon from be-&#xD;
coming infested with worms. In so warm a climate&#xD;
it is difficult to preserve it, and very many times my-&#xD;
self and my companions have received our weekly&#xD;
allowance of three pounds and a half, when it was&#xD;
full of these disgusting vermin.&#xD;
Although the swamps are overrun with cattle, they&#xD;
are never made the source of profit, to any considera-&#xD;
ble extent. The planter cuts his mark upon the ear,&#xD;
or brands his initials upon the side, and turns them&#xD;
into the swamps, to roam unrestricted within their&#xD;
almost limitless confines. They are the Spanish breed,&#xD;
small and spike-horned. I have known of droves&#xD;
being taken from Bayou Bcuf, but it is of very rare&#xD;
occurrence. The value of the best cows is about five&#xD;
dollars each. Two quarts at one milking, would be&#xD;
considered an unusual large quantity. They furnish&#xD;
little tallow, and that of a soft, inferior quality. . Not-&#xD;

14   .       TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
withstanding the great number of cows that throng&#xD;
the swamps, the planters are indebted to the North&#xD;
for their cheese and butter, which is purchased-in the&#xD;
New-Orleans market. Salted beef is not an article of&#xD;
food either in the great house, or in the cabin.&#xD;
Master- Epps was accustomed, to attend shooting&#xD;
matches for the purpose of obtaining what fresh beef&#xD;
he required. These sports occurred weekly at the&#xD;
neighboring village of Holmesville. Fat beeves are&#xD;
driven thither and shot at, a stipulated price being&#xD;
demanded for the privilege. The lucky marksman&#xD;
divides the flesh among his fellows, and in this man-&#xD;
ner the attending planters are supplied.&#xD;
The great number of tame and .untamed cattle&#xD;
which swarm the woods and swamps of Bayou Bceuf,&#xD;
most probably suggested that appellation to the&#xD;
French, inasmuch as the term, translated, signifies the&#xD;
creek or river of .the wild ox.&#xD;
Garden products, such as cabbages, turnips and the&#xD;
like, are cultivated for the use of the master and his&#xD;
family. They have greens and vegetables at all times&#xD;
and seasons of the year. "The grass withereth and&#xD;
the flower fadeth" before the desolating winds of au-&#xD;
tumn in the chill northern latitudes, but perpetual&#xD;
verdure overspreads the :.hot lowlands, and flowers&#xD;
bloom in the heart of winter, in the region of Bayou&#xD;
Bouf..&#xD;
There are no meadows appropriated to the cultiva-&#xD;
tion of the grasses. The leaves of the corn supply a&#xD;
sufficiency of food for the laboring cattle, while the&#xD;

PATSEY, THE VICTIM.&#xD;
. ON my arrival at Master Epps', in obedience to his&#xD;
order, the first business upon which I entered was the&#xD;
making of an axe-helve. The handles in use there&#xD;
are simply a round, straight stick. I made a crooked&#xD;
one, shaped like those to which I had been agcustom-&#xD;
ed at the North. When finished, and presented to&#xD;
Epps, he looked at it with astonishment, unable to&#xD;
determine exactly what it was.       He had never before&#xD;
seen such a handle, and when I explained its conveni-&#xD;
ences, he was forcibly struck with the novelty of the&#xD;
idea. He kept it in the house a long time, and when his&#xD;
friends called, was wont to exhibit it as a curiosity.&#xD;
It was now the season of hoeing.- I was first sent&#xD;
&#xD;
into the corn-field, and afterwards set to scraping cot-&#xD;
ton. In this employment I remained until hoeing&#xD;
time was nearly passed, when I began to experience&#xD;
the symptoms of approaching illness. I was attacked&#xD;
with chills, which were succeeded by a burning fever.&#xD;
I became weak and emaciated, and frequently so diz-&#xD;
zy that it caused me to reel and stagger like a drunk-&#xD;
en man. Nevertheless, I was compelled to keep up&#xD;
my row. When in health I found little difficulty in&#xD;
keeping pace with my fellow-laborers, but now it&#xD;
seemed to be an utter impossibility. Often I fell be-&#xD;
hind, when the driver's lash was sure to greet my&#xD;
back, infusing into my sick and drooping body a little&#xD;
temporary energy. I continued to decline until at&#xD;
length the whip became entirely ineffectual. The&#xD;
sharpest sting of the rawhide could not arouse me.&#xD;
Finally, in September, when the busy season of cotton&#xD;
picking was at hand, I was unable to leave my cabin.&#xD;
Up to this time I had received no medicine, nor any&#xD;
attention from my master or mistress. The old cook&#xD;
visited me occasionally, preparing me corn-coffee, and&#xD;
sometimes boiling a bit of bacon, when I had grown&#xD;
too feeble to accomplish it myself.&#xD;
When it was said that I would die, Master Epps,&#xD;
unwilling to bear the loss, which the death of an ani-&#xD;
mal worth a thousand dollars would bring upon him,'&#xD;
concluded to incur the expense of sending to HIohnes-&#xD;
ville for Dr. Wines. He announced to Epps that it&#xD;
was the effect of the climate, and there was a proba-&#xD;
bility of his losing me. He directed me to eat no&#xD;

meat, and to partake of no more food than was abso-&#xD;
lutely necessary to sustain life. Several weeks elaps-&#xD;
ed, during which time, under the scanty diet to which&#xD;
I was subjected, I had partially recovered. One&#xD;
morning, long before I was in a proper condition to&#xD;
labor, Epps appeared at the cabin door, and, present-&#xD;
ing me a sack, ordered me to the cotton field. At this&#xD;
time I had had no experience whatever in cotton pick-&#xD;
ing. It was an awkward business indeed. While&#xD;
others used both hands, snatching the cotton and de-&#xD;
positing it in the mouth of the sack, with a precision&#xD;
and dexterity that was incomprehensible to me, I&#xD;
had to seize the boll with one hand, and deliberately&#xD;
draw out the white, gushing blossom with the other.&#xD;
Depositing the cotton in the sack, moreover, was a&#xD;
difficulty that demanded the exercise of both hands&#xD;
and eyes. I was compelled to pick it from the ground&#xD;
where it would fall, nearly as often as from the stalk&#xD;
where it had grown. I made havoc also with the&#xD;
branches, 'loaded with the yet unbroken bolls, the&#xD;
long, cumbersome sackl swinging from side to side in&#xD;
a manner not allowable in the cotton field. After a&#xD;
most laborious day I arrived at the gin-house with my&#xD;
load. When the scale determined its weight to be&#xD;
only ninety-five pounds, not half the quantity required&#xD;
of the poorest picker, Epps threatened the severest.&#xD;
flogging, but in consideration of my being a "raw&#xD;
hand," concluded to pardon me on that occasion.,&#xD;
The following day, and many days succeeding, I re-&#xD;
turned at night with no better success--I was evi.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
dently not designed for that kind of labor. I had not&#xD;
the gift - the dexterous fingers and quick motion of&#xD;
Patsey, who could fly along one side of a row of cot-&#xD;
ton, stripping it of its undefiled and fleecy whiteness&#xD;
miraculously fast. Practice and whipping were alike&#xD;
unavailing, and Epps, satisfied of it at last, swore I was&#xD;
a disgrace - that I was not fit to associate with a cot-&#xD;
ton-picking "nigger" -that I could'not pick enough&#xD;
in a day to pay the trouble of weighing it, and that I&#xD;
should go into the cotton field no more. I was now&#xD;
employed in cutting and hauling wood,. drawing cot-&#xD;
ton from the field to the gin-house, and performed&#xD;
whatever other service was required. Suffice to say,&#xD;
I was never permitted to be idle.&#xD;
It was rarely that a day passed by without one or&#xD;
more whippings. This occurred at the time the cot-&#xD;
ton was weighed. The delinquent, whose weight had&#xD;
fallen short, was taken out, stripped, made to lie upon&#xD;
the ground, face downwards, when he received a pun-&#xD;
ishment proportioned to his offence. It is the literal,&#xD;
unvarnished truth, that the crack of the lash, and&#xD;
the shrieking of the slaves, can be heard from dark&#xD;
till bed time, on Epps' plantation, any day almost&#xD;
during the entire period of the cotton-picking season.&#xD;
The number of lashes is graduated according to the&#xD;
nature of the case. Twenty-five are deemed a mere'&#xD;
brush, inflicted, for instance, when a dry leaf or piece&#xD;
of boll r' found in the cotton, or. when a branch is&#xD;
broken in the field ; fifty is the ordinary penalty fol-&#xD;

five hundred, well laid on, besides the mangling of&#xD;
the dogs, perhaps, is certain to consign the poor, un-&#xD;
pitied runaway to weeks of pain and agony.&#xD;
During the two "years Epps remained on the plan-&#xD;
tation at Bayou Huff Power, he was in the habit, as&#xD;
often as once in a fortnight at least, of coming home&#xD;
intoxicated from Ilolmesville. The shooting-matches&#xD;
almost invariably concluded with a debauch. At such&#xD;
times he was boisterous and half-crazy. Often he&#xD;
would break the dishes, chairs, and whatever furni-&#xD;
ture he could lay his hands on. When satisfied with&#xD;
his amusement in the house, he would seize the whip&#xD;
and walk forth into the yard. Then it behooved the&#xD;
slaves to be watchful and exceeding wary. The first&#xD;
one who came within reach felt the smart of his lash.&#xD;
Sometimes for hours he would.keep them running in&#xD;
all directions, dodging around the corners of the cab-&#xD;
ins. Occasionally he would come upon one unawares,&#xD;
and if he succeeded in inflicting a fair, round blow, it&#xD;
was a feat that much delighted him. The younger&#xD;
children, and the aged, who had become inactive,&#xD;
suffered then. In the midst of the confusion he would&#xD;
slily take his stand behind a cabin, waiting with rais-&#xD;
ed whip, to dash it into the first black face that peep-&#xD;
ed cautiously around the corner.&#xD;
At other times he would come home in a less brutal&#xD;

humor.. Then there must be a merry-making. Then&#xD;
all must move to the measure .of a tune.. Then Mas-&#xD;
ter Epps must needs regale his melodious ears with&#xD;
the music of a fiddle. Then did he becofne buoyant,&#xD;
elastic, gaily "tripping the light fantastic toe" around&#xD;
the piazza and all through the house.&#xD;
Tibeats, at the time of my sale, had informed&#xD;
him I could play on the violin. He had receiv-&#xD;
ed his information from  Ford. Through the im-&#xD;
portunities of Mistress Epps, her husband had been in-&#xD;
duced to purchase me one during a visit to New-Or-&#xD;
leans. Frequently I was called into the house to play&#xD;
before the family, mistress being passionately fond of&#xD;
music.&#xD;
All of us would be assembled in the large room of&#xD;
the great house, whenever Epps came home in one of&#xD;
his dancing moods. No matter how worn out and&#xD;
'tired we were, there must be a general dance. When&#xD;
properly stationed on the floor, I would strike up a tune.&#xD;
.     "Dance, you d-d niggers, dance," Epps would&#xD;
shout.&#xD;
Then there must be no halting or delay, no slow or&#xD;
languid movements ; all must be brisk,. and lively,&#xD;
and alert. "Up and down;, heel and toe, and away&#xD;
we go," was the order of the hour. Epps' portly form&#xD;
mingled with those of his dusky slaves, moving rap-&#xD;
idly through all the mazes of the dance.&#xD;
Usually his whip was' in his hand, ready to fall&#xD;
about the ears of the presumptuous thrall, who dared&#xD;
to rest a moment, or even stop to catch his breath.&#xD;

TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
When he was himself exhausted, there would be a&#xD;
brief cessation, but it would be very brief. With a&#xD;
slash, and crack, and flourish of the whip, he would&#xD;
shout again, "Dance, niggers, dance," and away they&#xD;
would go once more, pell-mell, while I, spurred by an&#xD;
occasional sharp touch of the lash, sat in a corner, ex-&#xD;
tracting from my violin a marvelous quick-stepping&#xD;
tune. The mistress often upbraided him, declaring&#xD;
she would return to her father's house at Cheneyville ;&#xD;
nevertheless, there were times she could not restrain,&#xD;
a burst of laughter, on witnessing his uproarious&#xD;
.pranks. Frequently, we were thus detained until al-&#xD;
most morning. Bent with excessive toil-actually-&#xD;
suffering for a little refreshing rest, and feeling rather&#xD;
as if we could cast ourselves upon the earth and weep,&#xD;
many a night in the house of Edwin Epps have his&#xD;
unhappy slaves been made to dance and laugh.&#xD;
Notwithstanding these deprivations in order to grat-&#xD;
ify the whim of an unreasonable master, we had to&#xD;
be in the field as soon as it was light, and during the&#xD;
day perform the ordinary and accustomed task. Such&#xD;
deprivations could not be urged at the scales in exten-&#xD;
uation of any lack of weight, or in the cornfield for&#xD;
not hoeing with the usual rapidity. The whippings,&#xD;
were just as severe as if we had gone forth in the&#xD;
morning, strengthened and invigorated by a night's&#xD;
repose. Indeed, after such frantic revels, he was&#xD;
always more sour and savage than before, punishing&#xD;
for slighter causes, and using the whip with increased&#xD;
and more vindictive energy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ten years I toiled for that man without reward.&#xD;
Ten years of my incessant labor has contributed to&#xD;
increase the bulk of his possessions. Ten years I was&#xD;
compelled to address him with down-cast eyes and&#xD;
uncovered head -in the attitude and language of a&#xD;
slave. I am indebted to him for nothing, save unde-&#xD;
served abuse and stripes.&#xD;
Beyond the reach of his inhuman thong, and stand-&#xD;
ing on the soil of the free State where I was born,&#xD;
thanks be to Heaven, I can raise my head once more&#xD;
among men. I can speak of the wrongs I have suf-&#xD;
fered, and of those who inflicted them, with upraised&#xD;
eyes. But I have no desire to speak of him or any&#xD;
other one otherwise than truthfully. Yet to speak&#xD;
truthfully of Edwin Epps would be to say -he is a&#xD;
man in whose heart the quality of kindness or of jus-&#xD;
tice is not found. A rough, rude energy, united with&#xD;
an uncultivated mind and an avaricious spirit, are his&#xD;
prominent characteristics. He is known as a "nigger&#xD;
breaker," distinguished for his faculty of subduing the&#xD;
spirit of the slave, and priding himself upon his repu-&#xD;
tation in this respect, as a jockey boasts of his skill in&#xD;
managing a refractory horse. He looked upon a col-&#xD;
ored man, not as a human being, responsible to his Crea-&#xD;
tor for the small talent entrusted to him, but as a " chat-&#xD;
tel personal," as mere live property, no better, except&#xD;
in value, than his mule or dog. When the evidence,&#xD;
clear and indisputable, was laid before him that I was&#xD;
a free man, and as much entitled to my liberty as he&#xD;
~ when, on the day I left, he was informed that I&#xD;

had a wife and children, as dear to me as his own&#xD;
babes to him, he only raved and swore, denouncing&#xD;
the law that tore me from him, and declaring he&#xD;
would find out the man who had forwarded the letter&#xD;
that disclosed the place of my captivity, if there was&#xD;
any virtue or power in money, and would take his&#xD;
life. lie thought of nothing but his loss, and cursed&#xD;
me for having been born free. He could have stood&#xD;
unmoved and seen the tongues of his poor slaves&#xD;
torn out by the roots - he could have seen them&#xD;
burned to ashes over a slow fire, or gnawed to death&#xD;
by dogs, if it only brought him profit. Such a hard,&#xD;
cruel, unjust man is Edwin Epps.&#xD;
There was but one greater savage on Bayou Beuf&#xD;
than he. Jim Burns' plantation was cultivated, as&#xD;
already mentioned, exclusively by women. That&#xD;
barbarian kept their backs so sore and raw, that they&#xD;
could not perform the customary labor demanded&#xD;
daily of the slave. le boasted of his cruelty, and&#xD;
through all the country round was accounted a more&#xD;
thorough-going, energetic man than even Epps. A'&#xD;
brute himself, Jim Burns had not a particle of mercy&#xD;
for his subject brutes, and like a fool, whipped and&#xD;
scourged away the very strength upon which depend-&#xD;
ed his amount of gain.&#xD;
Epps remained on Huff Power two years, when,&#xD;
having accumulated a considerable sum of money, he&#xD;
expended it in the purchase of the plantation on the&#xD;
east bank of Bayou Beuf, where lie still continues to&#xD;
reside. He took 'possession of it in 1845, after the&#xD;

nine slaves, all of whom, 'except myself, and Susan,&#xD;
who has since died, remain there yet. le made no&#xD;
addition to this force, and for eight years the follow-&#xD;
ing were my companions in his quarters, viz: -Abram,&#xD;
Wiley, Phebe, Bob, Henry, Edward, and Patsey.&#xD;
All these, except Edward, born since, were purchased&#xD;
out of a drove by Epps during the time he was over-&#xD;
seer for Archy B. Williams, whose plantation is situa-&#xD;
ted on the shore of Red River, not far from Alexan-&#xD;
dria.&#xD;
Abram was tall, standing a full head above any&#xD;
common man. He is sixty .years of age, and was&#xD;
born in Tennessee. Twenty years ago, he was pur-&#xD;
chased by a trader, carried into South Carolina, and&#xD;
sold to James Buford, .of Williamsburgh county, in&#xD;
that State. In his youth he was renowned for his&#xD;
great strength, but age and unremitting toil have&#xD;
somewhat shattered his powerful frame and enfeebled&#xD;
his mental faculties.&#xD;
Wiley is forty-eight. He was born on the estate&#xD;
of William Tassle, and for many years took.charge of&#xD;
that gentleman's ferry over the Big Black River, in&#xD;
South Carolina.&#xD;
Phebe was a slave of Buford, Tassle's neighbor,&#xD;
and having married Wiley, he bought the latter, at&#xD;
her instigation. Buford was a kind master, sheriff of&#xD;
the county, arnd in those days a man of wealth.&#xD;

place to Wiley. That seductive youth had insinuated&#xD;
himself into Phebe's affections, and therefore the&#xD;
faithless spouse had gently kicked her first husband&#xD;
out of her cabin door. Edward had been born .to&#xD;
them on Bayou Huff Power.&#xD;
Patsey is twenty-three -also from Buford's planta-&#xD;
tion. She is in no wise connected with the others,&#xD;
but glories in the fact that she is the offspring of a&#xD;
" Guinea nigger," brought over to Cuba in a slave&#xD;
ship, and in the course of trade transferred to Buford,&#xD;
who was her mother's owner.&#xD;
This, as I learned from them, is a genealogical account&#xD;
of my master's slaves. For years they had been to-&#xD;
gether. Often they recalled the memories of other&#xD;
days, and sighed to retrace their steps to the old home&#xD;
in Carolina. Troubles came upon their master Bu-&#xD;
ford, which brought far greater troubles upon them.&#xD;
- He became involved in debt, and unable to bear up&#xD;
against his failing fortunes, was compelled to sell these,&#xD;
and others'of his slaves. In a chain gang they had&#xD;
been driven from beyond the Mississippi to the plan-&#xD;
tation-of Archy B. Williams. Edwin Epps, who, for a&#xD;
long while had been his driver and overseer, was&#xD;
about establishing himself in business on his own ac-&#xD;
count, at the time of their arrival, and accepted them&#xD;
in payment of his wages.&#xD;
Old Abram was a kind-hearted being-a sort of&#xD;
patriarch among us, fond of entertaining his younger&#xD;
brethren with grave and serious discourse. He was&#xD;
deeply versed in such philosophy as is taught in the&#xD;
&#xD;
cabin of the slave; but the great absorbing hobby of&#xD;
Uncle Abram was General Jackson, whom his young&#xD;
master in Tennessee had followed to the wars. He&#xD;
loved to wander back, in imagination, to the place&#xD;
where he was born, and to recount the scenes of his&#xD;
youth during those stirring times when the nation was&#xD;
in arms. He had been athletic, and more keen and&#xD;
powerful than the generality of his race, but now his&#xD;
eye had become dim, and his natural force abated.&#xD;
Very often, indeed, while discussing the best method&#xD;
of baking the hoe-cake, or expatiating at large upon&#xD;
the glory of Jackson, he would forget where he left&#xD;
his hat, or his hoe, or his basket; and then would the&#xD;
old man be laughed at, if Epps was absent, and whip-&#xD;
ped if he was present. So was he perplexed continu-&#xD;
ally, and sighed to think that he was growing aged&#xD;
and going to decay.. Philosophy and Jackson and&#xD;
forgetfulness had played the mischief with him, and&#xD;
it was evident that all of them combined were fast&#xD;
bringing down the gray hairs of Uncle Abram to the&#xD;
grave.&#xD;
Aunt Phebe had been an excellent field hand, but&#xD;
latterly was put into the kitchen, where she remained,&#xD;
except occasionally, in a time of uncommon hurry.&#xD;
She was a sly old creature, and when not in the&#xD;
presence of her mistress or her master, was garrulous-&#xD;
in the extreme.&#xD;
Wiley, on the contrary, was silent. He performed&#xD;
his task without murmur or complaint, seldom in-&#xD;
dulging in the luxury of speech, except to utter a&#xD;

wish that he was away from Epps, and back once&#xD;
more in South Carolina.&#xD;
Bob and Henry had reached the ages of twenty&#xD;
and twenty-three, and were distinguished for nothing&#xD;
extraordinary or unusual, while Edward, a lad of&#xD;
thirteen, not yet able to maintain his row in the corn&#xD;
or the cotton field, was kept in the great house, to&#xD;
wait on the little Eppses.&#xD;
Patsey was slim and straight. She stood erect as&#xD;
the human form is capable of standing. There was&#xD;
an air of loftiness in her movement, that neither labor,&#xD;
nor weariness, nor punishment could destroy. Truly,&#xD;
Patsey was a splendid animal, and were it not that&#xD;
bondage had enshrouded her intellect in utter and&#xD;
everlasting darkness, would have been chief among&#xD;
ten thousand of her people. She could leap the&#xD;
highest fences, and a fleet hound it was indeed, that&#xD;
could outstrip her in a race. No horse could fling her&#xD;
from his back. She was a skillful teamster. She&#xD;
turned as true a furrow as the best, and at splitting&#xD;
rails there were none who could excel her. When&#xD;
the order to halt was heard at night, she would have&#xD;
her mules at the crib, unharnessed, fed and curried,&#xD;
before uncle Abram had found his hat. Not, how-&#xD;
ever, for all or any of these, was she chiefly famous.&#xD;
Such lightning-like motion was in her fingers as no&#xD;
other fingers ever possessed, and.therefore it was, that&#xD;
in cotton picking time, Patsey was queen of the field.&#xD;
She had a genial and pleasant temper, and was&#xD;
faithful and obedient. Naturally, she was a joyous&#xD;
&#xD;
creature, a laughing, light-hearted girl, rejoicing in&#xD;
the mere sense of existence. Yet Patsey wept oftener,&#xD;
and suffered more, than any of her companions.&#xD;
She had been literally excoriated. Her back bore&#xD;
the scars of a thousand stripes; not because she was&#xD;
backward in her work, nor because she was of an un-&#xD;
mindful and rebellious spirit, but because it had fallen&#xD;
to her lot to be the slave of a licentious master and a&#xD;
jealous mistress. She shrank before the'lustful eye of&#xD;
the one, and was in danger even of her life at the&#xD;
hands of the- other, and between the two, she was&#xD;
indeed accursed. In the great house, for days together,&#xD;
there were high. and angry words, postings and&#xD;
estrangement, whereof she was the innocent cause.&#xD;
Nothing delighted the mistress so much as to see her&#xD;
suffer, and more than once, when Epps had refused to&#xD;
sell her, has she tempted me with bribes to put her&#xD;
secretly to death, and bury her body in some lonely&#xD;
place in the margin of the swamp. Gladly would&#xD;
Patsey have appeased this unforgiving spirit, if it had&#xD;
been in her power, but not like Joseph, dared she&#xD;
escape from Master Epps, leaving her garment in his&#xD;
hand. Patsey walked under a cloud. If she uttered&#xD;
a word in opposition to her master's will, the lash was&#xD;
resorted to at once, to bring her to subjection ; if she&#xD;
was not watchful when about her cabin, or when&#xD;
walking in the yard, a.billet of wood, or a broken&#xD;
bottle perhaps, hurled from her mistress' hand, would&#xD;
smite her unexpectedly in the face. The enslaved vic-&#xD;
tim of lust and hate, Patsey had no comfort of her life.&#xD;

THE first year of Epps' residence on         the bayou,&#xD;
1845, the caterpillars almost totally destroyed the&#xD;
cotton crop throughout that region. There was little&#xD;
to be done, so that the slaves were necessarily idle&#xD;
half the time. However, there came a rumor to Ba-&#xD;
you Bocuf that wages were high, and laborers in great&#xD;
demand on the sugar plantations in St. Mary's parish.&#xD;
This parish is situated on the coast of the Gulf of&#xD;
Mexico, about one hundred          and   forty miles from&#xD;
Avoyelles.    The Rio Teche, a considerable stream,&#xD;
flows through St. Mary's to the gulf.&#xD;

MARCH TO ST. MARY'S PARISH.       193&#xD;
&#xD;
It was determined by the planters, on the receipt&#xD;
of this intelligence, to make up a drove of slaves to&#xD;
be sent down to Tuckapaw in St. Mary's, for the pur.&#xD;
pose of hiring them out in the cane fields. Accord-&#xD;
ingly, in the month of September, there were one&#xD;
hundred and forty-sever collected at Holmesville,&#xD;
Abram, Bob and myself among the number. Of these&#xD;
about one-half were women. Epps, Alonson Pierce,&#xD;
Henry Toler, and Addison Roberts, were the white&#xD;
men, selected to accompany, and take charge of the&#xD;
drove. They had a two-horse carriage and two sad-&#xD;
dle horses for their use. A large wagon, drawn. by&#xD;
four horses, and driven by John, a boy belonging to&#xD;
Mr. Roberts, carried the blankets and provisions.&#xD;
About 2 o'clock in the afternoon, having been fed,&#xD;
preparations were made to depart. The duty assign-&#xD;
ed me was, to take charge of the blankets and pro-.&#xD;
visions, and see that none were lost by the way. The,&#xD;
carriage proceeded in advance, the wagon following ;&#xD;
behind this the slaves were arranged, while the two&#xD;
horsemen brought up the rear, and in this order the&#xD;
procession moved out of. Holmesville.&#xD;
That night we reached a Mr. McCrow's plantation,&#xD;
a distance of ten or fifteen miles, when we were or-&#xD;
dered to halt. Large fires were built, and each one&#xD;
spreading his blanket on the ground, laid down upon&#xD;
it. The white men lodged in the great house. An&#xD;
hour before day we were aroused by the drivers com-&#xD;
ing among us, cracking their whips and ordering us&#xD;
to arise. Then the blankets were rolled up, and be-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing severally delivered to me and deposited in the&#xD;
wagon, the procession set forth again.&#xD;
The following night it rained violently. We were&#xD;
all drenched, our clothes saturated with mud and wa-&#xD;
ter. Reaching an open shed, formerly a gin-house, we&#xD;
found beneath it such shelter as it afforded. There&#xD;
was not room for all of us to lay down. There we&#xD;
remained, huddled together, through the night, con-&#xD;
'tinuing our march, as usual, in the morning. During&#xD;
the journey we were fed twice a day, boiling our&#xD;
bacon and baking our corn-cake at the fires in the&#xD;
same manner as in our huts. We passed through La-&#xD;
fayetteville, Mountsville, New-Town, to Centreville,&#xD;
where Bob and Uncle Abram were hired. Our num-&#xD;
ber decreased as we advanced -nearly every sugar&#xD;
plantation requiring the services of one or more.&#xD;
On our route we passed the Grand Coteau or prairie,&#xD;
a vast space of level, monotonous country, without a&#xD;
tree, except an occasional one which had been trans-&#xD;
planted near some dilapidated dwelling. It was once&#xD;
thickly populated, and under cultivation, but for some&#xD;
cause had been abandoned. The business of the&#xD;
scattered inhabitants that now dwell upon it is prin-&#xD;
cipally raising cattle. Immense herds were feeding&#xD;
upon it as we passed. In the centre of the Grand&#xD;
Coteau one feels as if he were on the ocean, out&#xD;
of sight of land. As far as the eye can see, in all&#xD;
directions, it is but a ruined and deserted waste.&#xD;
I was hired to Judge Turner, a distinguished man&#xD;
and extensive planter, whose large estate is situated&#xD;

TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
on Bayou Salle, within a few miles of the gulf. Bay&#xD;
ou Salle is a small stream flowing into the bgy of&#xD;
Atchafalaya. For some days I was employed at&#xD;
Turner's in repairing his sugar house, when a cane&#xD;
knife was put into my hand, and with thirty or&#xD;
forty others, I was sent into the field. I found no&#xD;
such difficulty in learning the art of cutting cane&#xD;
that I had in picking cotton. It came to me" natural-&#xD;
ly and intuitively, and in a short time I was able to&#xD;
keep up with the fastest knife. Before the cutting&#xD;
was over, however, Judge Tanner transferred me from&#xD;
the field to the sugar house, to act there in the ca-&#xD;
pacity of driver. From the time of the commence-&#xD;
ment of sugar making to the close, the grinding and&#xD;
boiling does not cease day or night. The whip was&#xD;
given me with directions to use it upon any one who&#xD;
was caught standing idle. If I failed to obey them&#xD;
to the letter, there was another one for my own back.&#xD;
Ii addition to this my duty was to call on and off the&#xD;
different gangs at the proper time. I had no regular&#xD;
periods of rest, and could never snatch but a few mo-&#xD;
ments of sleep at a time.&#xD;
It is the custom in Louisiana, as I presume it is in&#xD;
other slave States, to allow the slave to retain what-&#xD;
ever compensation he may obtain for services per.&#xD;
formed on Sundays. In this way, only, are they able&#xD;
to provide themselves with any luxury or conveni.&#xD;
ence whatever. When a slave, purchased,or kidnap.&#xD;
ped in the North, is transported to a cabin an Bayou&#xD;
Bceuf, he is furnished with neither knife, nor fork,&#xD;

He is furnished with a blanket before he reaches&#xD;
there, and wrapping that around him, he can either&#xD;
stand up, or lie down upon the ground, or on a board,&#xD;
if his master has no use for it. He is at- liberty to&#xD;
find a gourd in which to keep his meal, or hecan eat&#xD;
his corn from the cob, just as he pleases. To ask tile&#xD;
master for a knife, or skillet, or anysmall-convenience&#xD;
of the kind, would be answered with a kick, or' laugh-&#xD;
ed at as a joke. Whatever necessary article of this&#xD;
nature is found in a cabin has been purchased with&#xD;
Sunday money. However injurious to the morals,&#xD;
it is certainly a blessing to the physical condition of&#xD;
the slave, to be permitted to break the Sabbath.&#xD;
Otherwise there would be no way to provide him-&#xD;
self with any utensils, which seem to be indispensa-&#xD;
ble to him who is conpelled to be his' ovn cook.&#xD;
On cane plantations in sugar time, there is no dis-&#xD;
tinction as to the days of the week. It is well un-&#xD;
derstood that. all hands must labor on the Sabbath,&#xD;
and it is equally well understood that those especial-&#xD;
ly who are hired, as I was to Judge Turner, and oth-&#xD;
ers in succeeding years, shall receive remuneration&#xD;
for it. It is usual, also, in the most hurrying time of&#xD;
cotton-picking, to require the same extra service.&#xD;
From this source, slaves generally are afforded an&#xD;
opportunity of earning sufficient to purchase a knife,'&#xD;
a kettle, tobacco and so forth. The females, discard-&#xD;
ing the latter luxury, are apt to expend their little&#xD;

revenue in the purchase of gaudy ribbons, wherewithal&#xD;
to deck their hair in the merry season of the holidays.&#xD;
I remained in St. Mary's until the first of January,&#xD;
during which time my Sunday money amounted to&#xD;
ten dollars. I met with other good fortune, for which&#xD;
I was indebted to my violin, my constant companion,&#xD;
the source of profit, and soother of my sorrows during&#xD;
years of servitude. There was a grand party of&#xD;
whites assembled at Mr. Yarney's, in Centreville, a&#xD;
hamlet in the vicinity of Turner's plantation. I was&#xD;
employed to play for them, and so well pleased were&#xD;
the merry-makers with my performance, that a con.&#xD;
tribution was taken for my benefit, which amounted&#xD;
to seventeen dollars.&#xD;
With this sum in possession, I was looked upon by&#xD;
my fellows as a millionaire. It afforded me great&#xD;
pleasure to look at it - to count it over and over&#xD;
again, day after day. Visions of cabin furniture, of&#xD;
water pails, of pocket knives, new shoes, and coats&#xD;
and hats, floated through my fancy, and up through&#xD;
all rose the triumphant contemplation, that I was.&#xD;
the wealthiest "nigger" on Bayou Bceuf.&#xD;
Vessels run up the .IRio Teche 'to Centreville.&#xD;
While there, I was bold enough one day to present&#xD;
myself before the captain of a steamer, and beg per-&#xD;
mission to hide myself among the freight. I was&#xD;
emboldened to risk the hazard of such a step, from&#xD;
overhearing a conversation, in the course of which I&#xD;
ascertained he was a native of the North. I did not&#xD;
relate to him the particulars of my history, but only&#xD;
&#xD;
expressed an ardent desire to escape from slavery to&#xD;
a free State. He pitied me, but said it would be im-"&#xD;
possible to avoid the vigilant custom house officers in&#xD;
New-Orleans, and that detection would subject him&#xD;
to punishment, and his vessel to confiscation. My&#xD;
earnest entreaties evidently excited his sympathies,&#xD;
and doubtless he would have yielded to them,.could&#xD;
he have done so with any kind of safety. I was&#xD;
compelled to smother the sudden flame that lighted&#xD;
up my bosom with sweet hopes of liberation, and&#xD;
turn my steps once more towards the increasing&#xD;
darkness of despair.&#xD;
Immediately after this event the drove assembled&#xD;
at Centreville, and several of the owners having ar-&#xD;
rived and collected the monies due for our services,&#xD;
we were driven back to Bayou Boeuf. It was on our&#xD;
return, while passing through a small village, that I&#xD;
caught sight of Tibeats, seated in the door of a dirty&#xD;
grocery, looking somewhat seedy and out of repair.&#xD;
Passion and poor whisky, I doubt not, have ere this&#xD;
laid him on the shelf.&#xD;
During our absence, I learned from Aunt Phebe&#xD;
and Patsey, that the latter had been getting deeper&#xD;
and deeper into trouble. The poor girl was truly an&#xD;
object of pity. "Old Hogjaw," the name by which&#xD;
Epps was called, when the slaves were by themselves,&#xD;
had beaten her'more severely and frequently than&#xD;
ever. As surely as he came from Holmesville, elated&#xD;
with liquor -and it was often in those days - he&#xD;
would whip her, merely to gratify the mistress; would&#xD;

&#xD;
punish her to an extent almost beyond endurance, for&#xD;
an offence of which he himself was the sole and irre-&#xD;
sistible cause. In his sober moments he could not al-&#xD;
ways be prevailed upon to indulge his wife's insatia-&#xD;
ble thirst for vengeance.&#xD;
To be rid of Patsey - to place her beyond sight or&#xD;
reach, by sale, or death, or in any other manner, of&#xD;
late years, seemed to be the ruling thought and pas-&#xD;
sion of my mistress. Patsey had been a favorite when&#xD;
a child, even in the great house. She had been pet-&#xD;
ted and admired for her uncommon sprightliness and&#xD;
pleasant disposition. She had been fed iriany a time,&#xD;
so Uncle Abram said, even on biscuit and milk, when&#xD;
the madam, in her younger days, was wont to call&#xD;
her to the piazza, and fondle her as she would a play-&#xD;
ful kitten. But a sad change had come over the spirit&#xD;
of the woman. Now, only black ~and angry fiends&#xD;
ministered in the temple of her heart, until she could&#xD;
look on Patsey but with concentrated venom.&#xD;
Mistress Epps was not naturally such an evil wo-&#xD;
man, after all. She was possessed of the devil, jeal-&#xD;
ousy, it is true, but aside from that, there was much&#xD;
in her character to admire. Her father, Mr. Roberts,&#xD;
resided in Cheneyville, an influential and honorable'&#xD;
man, and as much respected throughout the parish&#xD;
as any other citizen. She had been well educated at&#xD;
some institution this side the Mississippi; was beauti-&#xD;
ful, accomplished, and usually good-humored. She&#xD;
was kind to all of us but Patsey - frequently, in the&#xD;
absence of her husband, sending out to us some little&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
dainty from her own table. In other situations -in&#xD;
a different society from that which exists on the shores&#xD;
of Bayou Boeuf, she would have been pronounced an&#xD;
elegant and fascinating woman. An ill wind it was&#xD;
that blew her into the arms of Epps.&#xD;
He respected and loved his wife as much as a coarse&#xD;
nature like his is capable of loving, but supreme sel-&#xD;
fishness always overmastered conjugal affection.&#xD;
"He loved as well as baser natures can,&#xD;
But a mean heart and soul were in that man."&#xD;
lie was ready to gratify any whim - to grant any re-&#xD;
quest she made, provided it did not cost too much.&#xD;
Patsey was equal to any two of his slaves in the cot-&#xD;
ton field. He could not 'replace her with the same&#xD;
money she would bring. The idea of disposing of&#xD;
her, therefore, could not be entertained. The mistress&#xD;
did not regard her at all in that light. The pride of&#xD;
the haughty woman was aroused; the blood of the&#xD;
fiery southern boiled at the sight of Patsey, and noth-&#xD;
ing less than trampling out the life of the helpless&#xD;
bondwoman would satisfy her.&#xD;
Sometimes the current of her wrath turned upon&#xD;
him whom she had jus.t cause-to hate. But the storm&#xD;
of angry words would pass over at length, and there&#xD;
would be a season of calm again. At-such times Pat-&#xD;
sey trembled with fear, and cried as if her heart would&#xD;
break, for she knew from painful experience, that if&#xD;
mistress should work herself to the red-hot pitch of&#xD;
rage, Epps would quiet her at last with a promise that&#xD;
Patsey should be flogged - a promise he was sure to&#xD;

keep. Thus did pride, and jealousy, and vengeance&#xD;
war with avarice and brute-passion in the mansion of&#xD;
my master, filling it with daily tumult and conten-&#xD;
tion. Thus, upon the head of Patsey - the simple-&#xD;
minded slave, in whose heart God had implanted the&#xD;
seeds of virtue-the force of all these domestic tem-&#xD;
pests spent itself at last.&#xD;
During the summer succeeding my return from St.&#xD;
Mary's parish, I conceived a plan of providing myself&#xD;
with food, which, though simple, succeeded beyond&#xD;
expectation. It has been followed by many others&#xD;
in my condition, up and down the bayou, and of such,&#xD;
benefit has it become that I am almost persuaded to&#xD;
look upon myself as a benefactor. That summer the&#xD;
worms got into the bacon. Nothing but ravenous&#xD;
hunger could induce us to swallow it. The weekly&#xD;
allowance of meal scarcely sufficed to satisfy us. It&#xD;
was customary with us, as it is with all in that region,&#xD;
where the allowance is exhausted before Saturday&#xD;
night, or is in such a state as to render it nauseous&#xD;
and disgusting, to hunt in the swamps for coon and&#xD;
opossum. This, however, must be done at night, af-&#xD;
ter the day's work is accomplished. There are plan-&#xD;
ters whose slaves,. for months at a time, have no other&#xD;
meat than such as is obtained in this manner. No&#xD;
objections are made to hunting, inasmuch as it dis-&#xD;
penses with drafts upon the smoke-house, and because&#xD;
every marauding coon that is killed is so much saved&#xD;
from the standing corn. They are hunted with dogs&#xD;
and clubs, slaves not being allowed the use of fire-arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
The flesh of the coon is palatable, but verily there&#xD;
is nothing in all butcherdom so delicious as a roasted&#xD;
'possum. They are a round, rather long-bodied, little&#xD;
animal, of a whitish color, with nose like a pig, and&#xD;
caudal extremity like a rat. They burrow among&#xD;
the roots and in the hollows of the gum tree, and are&#xD;
clumsy and slow of motion. They are deceitful and&#xD;
cunning creatures. On receiving the slightest tap of&#xD;
a stick, they will roll over on the ground and feign&#xD;
death. If the hunter leaves him, in pursuit of anoth-&#xD;
er, without first taking particular pains to break his&#xD;
neck, the chances are, on his return, he is not to be&#xD;
found. The little animal has out witted the enemy&#xD;
has "played'possum" -and is off. But after a&#xD;
long and hard day's work, the weary slave feels little&#xD;
like going to the swamp for his supper, and half the&#xD;
time prefers throwing himself on the cabin floor with-&#xD;
out it. It is for the interest of the master that the ser-&#xD;
vant should not suffer in health from starvation, and&#xD;
it is also for his interest that he should not become gross&#xD;
from over-feeding. In the estimation of the owner, a&#xD;
slave is the most serviceable when- in rather a lean&#xD;
and lank condition, such a condition as the race-horse&#xD;
is in, when fitted for the course, and in that condition&#xD;
they are generally to be found on the sugar and cot-&#xD;
ton plantations along Red River.&#xD;
My cabin was -within a few rods of the bayou bank,&#xD;
and necessity being indeed the mother of invention, I&#xD;
resolved upon a mode of obtaining the requisite&#xD;
amount of food, without the trouble of resorting night.&#xD;

&#xD;
iy to the woods. This was to construct a fish trap.&#xD;
Having, in my mind, conceived the manner in which&#xD;
it could be done, the next Sunday I set about putting&#xD;
it into practical execution. It may be impossible for&#xD;
me to convey to the reader a full and correct idea of&#xD;
its. construction, but the following will serve as a gen-&#xD;
eral description:&#xD;
A frame between two and three feet square is made,&#xD;
and of a greater or less height, according to the&#xD;
depth of water. Boards or slats are nailed on three&#xD;
sides of this frame, not so closely, however, as to pre-&#xD;
vent the water circulating freely through it. ~.A door&#xD;
is fitted into the fourth side, in such manner that it&#xD;
will slide easily up and down in the g: oves cut in&#xD;
the two posts. A movable bottom is then so fitted&#xD;
that it can be raised to the top of the frame without&#xD;
difficulty. In the centre of the movable bottom an&#xD;
auger hole is bored, and into this one end of a handle&#xD;
or round stick is fastened on the under side so loosely&#xD;
that it will turn. The handle ascends from the centre&#xD;
of the movable bottom to the top of the frame, or as&#xD;
much higher as is desirable. Up and down this&#xD;
handle, in a great many places, are gimlet holes,&#xD;
through which small sticks are inserted, extending to&#xD;
opposite sides of the frame. So many of these small&#xD;
-sticks are running out from the handle in all direc-&#xD;
tions, that a fish of any considerable dimensions can-.&#xD;
not pass through without hitting one of them. The&#xD;
frame is then placed in the water and made sta-&#xD;
tionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
DESCRIPTION OF THE FISH TRAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
203&#xD;
&#xD;
The trap is " set" by sliding or drawing up the door,&#xD;
and kept in that position by another stick, one end&#xD;
of which rests in a notch on the inner side, the other&#xD;
end in a notch made in the handle, running up from&#xD;
the centre of the movable bottom. The trap is&#xD;
baited by rolling a handful of wet Weal and cotton&#xD;
together until it becomes hard, and depositing it in&#xD;
the back part of the frame. A fish swimming through&#xD;
the upraised door towards the bait, necessarily strikes&#xD;
one of the small sticks turning the handle, which dis&#xD;
placing the stick supporting the door, the latter falls,&#xD;
securing the fish within the frame. Taking hold of&#xD;
the top of the handle, the movable bottom is then&#xD;
drawn up to the surface of the water, and the fish&#xD;
taken out. There may have been other such traps in&#xD;
use before mine was constructed, but if' there were&#xD;
I had never happened to see one. Bayou Bocuf&#xD;
abounds in fish of large size and excellent quality,&#xD;
and after this time I was very rarely in want of one&#xD;
for myself, or for my comrades. Thus a mine was&#xD;
opened-a new resource was developed, hitherto un-&#xD;
thought of by the enslaved children of Africa, who&#xD;
toil and hunger along the shores of that sluggish, but&#xD;
prolific stream.&#xD;
About the time of which I am now writing, an&#xD;
event occurred in our immediate neighborhood, which&#xD;
made a deep impression upon me, and which shows&#xD;
the state of society existing there, and the manner in&#xD;
which affronts are oftentimes avenged* Directly op-&#xD;
posite our quarters, on the other side of the bayou,&#xD;

EPPS CHALLENGED.           205&#xD;
&#xD;
was situated the plantation of Mr. Marshall.. He&#xD;
belonged to a family among the most wealthy and&#xD;
aristocratic in the country. A gentleman from the&#xD;
vicinity of Natchez had been negotiating with him&#xD;
for the purchase of the estate. One day a messenger&#xD;
came in great lhaste to our plantation, saying that a&#xD;
bloody and fearful battle was going on at MarI&#xD;
shall's - that blood had been spilled - and unless&#xD;
the combatants were, forthwith separated, the result&#xD;
would be disastrous.&#xD;
On repairing to Marshall's house, a scene presented&#xD;
itself that beggars description. On the floor of one&#xD;
of the rooms lay the ghastly corpse of the man from&#xD;
Natchez, while Marshall, enraged and covered with.&#xD;
wounds and blood, was stalking back and forth,&#xD;
"breathing out threatenings and slaughter."  A diffi-&#xD;
culty had arisen in the course of their negotiation,&#xD;
high words ensued, when drawing their weapons, the&#xD;
deadly strife began that ended so unfortunately.&#xD;
Marshall was never placed in confinement. A sort of&#xD;
trial or investigation was had at Marksville, when he&#xD;
was acquitted, and returned to' his plantation, rather&#xD;
more respected, as I thought, than ever, from the fact&#xD;
that the blood of a fellow being was on his soul.&#xD;
Epps interested himself in his behalf, accompany-&#xD;
ing him to Marksville, and on all occasions loudly&#xD;
justifying him, but his services in this respect did not&#xD;
afterwards deter a kinsman of this same Marshall&#xD;
from seekingl1s life also. A brawl occurred between&#xD;
them over a gambling-table, which terminated in a&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;
&#xD;
TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
deadly feud. Riding up on horseback in front of the&#xD;
house one day, armed with pistols and bowie knife,&#xD;
Marshall challenged him to coine forth and make a&#xD;
final settlement of the quarrel, or he would brand&#xD;
him as a coward, and shoot him like a dog the first&#xD;
opportunity. Not through cowardice, nor from any&#xD;
conscientious scruples, in my opinion, but through the&#xD;
influence of his wife, he was restrained from accept-&#xD;
- ing the challenge of his enemy. A reconciliation,&#xD;
however, was effected afterward; since which time&#xD;
they have been on terms of the closest intimacy.&#xD;
Such occurrences, which would bring upon. the&#xD;
parties concerned in them merited and condign pun-&#xD;
ishment in the Northern States, are frequent on the&#xD;
bayou, and pass without notice, and almost without&#xD;

The existence of Slavery in its most cruel form&#xD;
among them, has a tendency to brutalize the humane&#xD;
and finer feelings of their nature. Daily witnesses of&#xD;
human suffering-listening to the agonizing screeches&#xD;
of the slave -beholding him writhing beneath the&#xD;
merciless lash -bitten and torn by dogs - dying&#xD;
without attention, and buried without shroud or&#xD;
coffin - it cannot otherwise be expected, than that&#xD;
they should become brutified and reckless of human&#xD;
life. It is true there are many kind-hearted and good&#xD;
men in the parish of Avoyelles -such men as Wil-&#xD;

liam Ford   who can look with pity upon the suffer-&#xD;
ings of a slave, just as there are, over all the world,&#xD;
sensitive and sympathetic spirits, who cannot look&#xD;
with indifference upon the sufferings of any creature&#xD;
which the Almighty has endowed with life. It is&#xD;
not the fault of the slaveholder that he is cruel, so&#xD;
much as it is the fault of the system under which he&#xD;
lives. He cannot withstand the influence of habit&#xD;
and associations that surround him. Taught from&#xD;
earliest childhood, by all that he sees and hears, that&#xD;
the rod is for the slave's back, he will not be apt to&#xD;
change his opinions in maturer years.&#xD;
There may be humane masters, as there certainly&#xD;
are inhuman ones -there may be slaves well-clothed,&#xD;
well-fed, and happy, as there surely are those half-&#xD;
clad, half-starved and miserable; .nevertheless, the&#xD;
institution that tolerates such wrong and inhumanity&#xD;
as I have witnessed, is a cruel, unjust, and barbarous&#xD;
one. Men may write fictions portraying lowly life as&#xD;
it is, or as it is not-may expatiate with owlish&#xD;
gravity upon the bliss of ignorance - discourse flip-&#xD;
pantly from arm chairs of the pleasures of slave life;&#xD;
but let them toil with him in the field-sleep with&#xD;
him in the cabin - feed with him on husks; let them&#xD;
behold him scourged, hunted,. trampled on, and they&#xD;
will come back with another story in their mouths.&#xD;
Let them know the heart of the poor slave^-learn&#xD;
his secret thoughts -thoughts he dare not utter in&#xD;
the hearing of the white man; let them sit by him&#xD;
in the silent watches of the night - converse with&#xD;
&#xD;
him in trustful confidence, of "life, liberty, and the&#xD;
pursuit of happiness," and they will find that ninety-&#xD;
nine out of every hundred are intelligent enough to&#xD;
understand their situation, and to cherish in their&#xD;
bosoms the love of freedom, as passionately as them-&#xD;
selves.&#xD;

THREE DAYS IN THE YEAR--TIE SYSTEM OF MARRIAGE-UNCLE ABRAM'S&#xD;
CONTEMPT OF MATRIMONY.&#xD;
IN consequence of my inability in cotton-picking,&#xD;
Epps was in the habit of hiring me out on sugar&#xD;
plantations during the season of cane-cutting and&#xD;
sugar-making. He received for my services a dollar&#xD;
a day, with the money supplying my place on his&#xD;
cotton plantation. Cutting cane was an employment&#xD;
that suited me, and for three successive years I held&#xD;
the lead row at Hawkins', leading a gang of from&#xD;
fifty to an hundred hands.&#xD;
In a previous chapter the mode of cultivating cot-&#xD;
ton is described. This may be the proper place to&#xD;
speak of the manner of cultivating cane.&#xD;
The ground is prepared in beds, the same as it is&#xD;
prepared for the reception of the cotton seed, except,&#xD;
&#xD;
it is ploughed deeper. Drills are made in the same&#xD;
manner. Planting commences in January, and con-&#xD;
tinues until April. It is necessary to plant a sugar&#xD;
field only once in three years. Three crops are taken&#xD;
before the seed or plant is exhausted.&#xD;
Three gangs are employed in the operation. One&#xD;
draws the cane from the rick, or stack, cutting the&#xD;
top and flags from the stalk, leaving only that part&#xD;
which is sound and healthy. Each joint of the cane&#xD;
has an eye, like the eye of a potato, which sends forth&#xD;
a sprout when buried in the soil. Another gang lays&#xD;
the cane in the drill, placing two stalks side by side&#xD;
in such manner that joints will occur-once in four or&#xD;
six inches. The third gang follows with hoe, drawing&#xD;
earth upon the stalks, and covering them to the depth&#xD;
of three inches.&#xD;
In four weeks, at the farthest, the sprouts appear&#xD;
above the ground, and from this time forward grow&#xD;
with great rapidity. A sugar field is hoed' three&#xD;
times, the same as cotton, save that a greater quantity&#xD;
of earth is drawn to the roots. By the first of Au-&#xD;
gust hoeing is usually over. About the middle of&#xD;
September, whatever is required for seed is cut and&#xD;
stacked in ricks, as they are termed. In October it&#xD;
is ready for the mill or sugar-house, and then the gen-&#xD;
eral cutting begins. The blade of a cane-knife is fif-&#xD;
teen inches long, three inches wide in the middle, and&#xD;
tapering towards the point and handle. The blade&#xD;
is thin, and in order to be at all serviceable must be&#xD;
kept very sharp. Every third hand takes the lead of&#xD;
~14&#xD;

&#xD;
two others, one of whom is on each side of him. The&#xD;
lead hand, in the first place, with a blow of his knife&#xD;
shears the flags from the stalk. He next cuts off the&#xD;
top down as far as it is green. He must be careful&#xD;
to sever all the green from the ripe part, inasmuch&#xD;
as the juice of the former sours the molasses, and ren-&#xD;
ders it unsalable. Then he severs the stalk at the&#xD;
root, and lays it directly behind him. His right and&#xD;
left hand companions lay their stalks, when cut in the&#xD;
same manner, upon his. To every three hands there&#xD;
is a .cart, which follows, and the stalks are thrown into&#xD;
it by the younger slaves, when it is drawn to the su-&#xD;
gar-house and ground.&#xD;
If the planter apprehends a frost, the cane is win-&#xD;
rowed. Winrowing is the cutting the stalks ,at an&#xD;
early period and throwing them lengthwise in the wa-&#xD;
ter furrow in such a manner that the tops will cover&#xD;
the butts of the stalks. They will remain in this con-&#xD;
dition three weeks or a month without souring, and&#xD;
secure from frost.. When the proper time arrives,&#xD;
they are taken up, trimmed and carted to the sugar-&#xD;
house.&#xD;
In the month of January the slaves enter the field&#xD;
again to prepare for another crop. The ground is&#xD;
now strewn with the tops, and flags cut from the past&#xD;
year's cane. On a dry day fire is set to this combus-&#xD;
tible refuse, which sweeps over the field, leaving it&#xD;
bare and clean, and ready for the hoes. The earth is&#xD;
loosened about the roots of the old stubble, and in&#xD;
process of time another crop springs up from the last.&#xD;
&#xD;
year's seed. It is the same the year following; but&#xD;
the -third year the seed has exhausted its strength,&#xD;
and the field must be ploughed and planted again.&#xD;
The second year the cane is sweeter and yields more&#xD;
than the first, and the third year more than the second.&#xD;
During the three seasons I labored on Hawkins'&#xD;
plantation, I was employed a considerable portion of&#xD;
the time in the sugar-house. He is celebrated as the&#xD;
producer of the finest variety of white sugar. The&#xD;
following is a general description of his sugar-house&#xD;
and the process of manufacture:&#xD;
The mill is an immense brick building, standing on&#xD;
the shore of the bayou.- Running out from the build-&#xD;
ing is an open shed, at least an hundred feet in length&#xD;
and forty or fifty feet in width. The boiler in which&#xD;
the steam is generated is situated outside the main&#xD;
building ; the machinery and engine rest on a brick&#xD;
pier, fifteen feet above the floor, within the body of the&#xD;
building. The machinery turns two great iron rollers,&#xD;
between two and three feet in diameter and six or&#xD;
eight feet in length. They are elevated above the&#xD;
brick pier, and roll in towards each other. An end-&#xD;
less carrier, made of chain and wood, like leathern&#xD;
belts used in small mills, extends from the iron rollers&#xD;
out of the main building and through the entire&#xD;
length of the open shed. The carts in which the cane&#xD;
is brought from the field as fast as it is cut, are un-&#xD;
loaded at the sides of the shed. All along the endless&#xD;
carrier are ranged slave children, whose business it is&#xD;
to place the cane upon it, when it is conveyed through&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
the shed into the main building, where it falls be-&#xD;
tween the rollers, is crushed, and drops upon another&#xD;
carrier that conveys it out of the main building in an&#xD;
opposite direction, depositing it in the top of a chim-&#xD;
ney upon a fire beneath, which consumes it. It is ne-&#xD;
cessary to burn it in this manner, because otherwise&#xD;
it would soon fill the building, and more especially&#xD;
because it would soon sour and engender disease.&#xD;
The juice of the cane falls into a conductor underneath&#xD;
the iron rollers, and is carried into a reservoir. Pipes&#xD;
convey it from, thence into five filterers, holding sev-&#xD;
eral hogsheads each. These filterers are filled with&#xD;
bone-black, a substance resembling pulverized char-&#xD;
coal.. It is made of bones calcinated in close vessels,&#xD;
and is used for, the purpose of decolorizing, by filtra-&#xD;
tion, the cane juice before boiling. Through these&#xD;
five filterers it passes in succession, and then runs into&#xD;
a large reservoir underneath the' ground floor, from&#xD;
whence it is carried up, by means of a steam pump,&#xD;
into a clarifier made of sheet iron, where it is heated&#xD;
by steam until it boils. From the first clarifier it is&#xD;
carried in pipes to a second and a third, and thence&#xD;
into close iron pans, through which tubes pass,filled&#xD;
with steam. While in a boiling state it flows through&#xD;
three pans in succession, and is then carried in other&#xD;
pipes down to the coolers on the ground floor. Cool-&#xD;
ers are wooden boxes with sieve bottoms made of the&#xD;
finest wire. As soon as the syrup passes into the&#xD;
coolers, and is met by the air, it grains, and the mo-&#xD;
lasses at once escapes through the sieves into a cistern&#xD;

below. It is then white or loaf sugar of the finest&#xD;
kind -clear, clean, and as white as snow. When&#xD;
cool, it is taken out, packed in hogsheads, and is ready&#xD;
for market. The molasses is then carried from the&#xD;
cistern into the, upper story again, and by another&#xD;
process converted into brown sugar.&#xD;
There are larger mills, and those constructed differ-&#xD;
ently from the one thus imperfectly described, but&#xD;
none, perhaps, more celebrated than this anywhere&#xD;
on Bayou Bouf. Lambert, of New-Orleans, is a part-&#xD;
ner of Hawkins. He is a man of vast wealth, hold-&#xD;
ing, as I have been told, an interest in over forty dif-&#xD;
ferent sugar plantations in Louisiana.&#xD;

The only respite from constant labor the slave has&#xD;
through the whole year, is during the Christmas holi-&#xD;
days.  Epps allowed us three -others allow four,&#xD;
five and six days, according to the measure of their&#xD;
generosity. It is the only time to which they look&#xD;
forward with any interest or pleasure. They are glad&#xD;
when night comes, not only because it brings them a&#xD;
few hours repose, but because it brings them one day&#xD;
nearer Christmas. It is hailed with equal delight by&#xD;
the old and the young; even Uncle Abram ceases to&#xD;
glorify Andrew Jackson, and Patsey forgets her many&#xD;
sorrows, amid the.general hilarity of the holidays. It&#xD;
is the time of feasting, and frolicking, and fiddling-&#xD;
the carnival season with the children of bondage.&#xD;
They are the only days when they are allowed a little&#xD;
restricted liberty, and heartily indeed do they enjoy it.&#xD;

THE CISTMAS SUPPER.         215&#xD;
&#xD;
It is the custom for one planter to give a " Christ-&#xD;
mas supper," inviting the slaves from neighboring&#xD;
plantations to join his own on the occasion; for in-&#xD;
stance, one year it is given by Epps, the next by Mar-&#xD;
shall, the next by Hawkins, and so on. Usually from&#xD;
three to five hundred are assembled, coming together&#xD;
on foot,in carts, on horseback, on mules, riding double&#xD;
and triple, sometimes a boy and girl, at others a girl&#xD;
and two boys, and at others again a boy, a girl and&#xD;
an old woman. Uncle Abram astride a mule, with"&#xD;
Aunt Phebe and Patsey behind him, trotting towards&#xD;
a Christmas supper, would be no uncommon sight on&#xD;
Bayou Bceuf.&#xD;
Then, too, "of all days i' the year," they array&#xD;
themselves in their best attire. The cotton coat has&#xD;
been washed clean, the stump of a tallow candle has&#xD;
been applied to the shoes, and if so fortunate as to pos-&#xD;
sess a rimless or a crownless hat, it is placed jauntily&#xD;
on the head. They are welcomed with equal cordial-&#xD;
ity, however, if they come bare-headed and bare-&#xD;
footed to the feast. As a general thing, the women&#xD;
wear handkerchiefs tied about their heads, but if&#xD;
chance has thrown in their way a fiery red ribbon,&#xD;
or a cast-off bonnet of their mistress' grandmother, it&#xD;
is sure to be worn on such occasions. Red - the deep&#xD;
blood red--is decidedly the favorite color among the&#xD;
enslaved damsels of my acquaintance. If a red rib-.&#xD;
bon does not encircle the neck, you will be certain to&#xD;
find all the hair of their woolly heads tied up with red&#xD;
strings of one sort or another.&#xD;
&#xD;
The table is spread in the open air, and loaded with&#xD;
varieties of meat and piles of vegetables. Bacon and&#xD;
corn meal at such times are dispensed with. Some-&#xD;
times the cooking is performed in the kitchen on the&#xD;
plantation, at others in the shade of wide branching&#xD;
. trees. In the latter case, a ditch is dug in the ground,&#xD;
aid wood laid in and burned until it is filled with&#xD;
glowing coals, over which chickens, ducks, turkeys,&#xD;
pigs, and not unfrequently the entire body of a wild&#xD;
ox, are roasted. They are furnished also with flour,&#xD;
of which biscuits are made, and often with peach and&#xD;
other preserves, with tarts, and every manner and de-&#xD;
scription of pies,T except the mince, that being an ar-&#xD;
ticle of pastry as yet unknown among them. Only&#xD;
the slave who has lived all the years on his scanty al-&#xD;
lowance of meal and bacon, can appreciate such sup-&#xD;
pers. White people in great numbers assemble to&#xD;
witness the gastronomical enjoyments.&#xD;
They seat themselves at the rustic table--the males&#xD;
on one side, the females on the other. The'two be-&#xD;
tween whom there may have been an exchange of&#xD;
tenderness, invariably manage to sit opposite; for the&#xD;
omnipresent Cupid disdains not to hurl his arrows into&#xD;
the simple hearts of slaves. Unalloyed and exulting&#xD;
happilness lights uj the dark faces of them all. The&#xD;
ivory teeth, contrasting with their black complexions,&#xD;
exhibit two long, white streaks the whole extent of&#xD;
the table. All round the bountiful board a multitude&#xD;
of eyes roll in ecstacy. Giggling and laughter and&#xD;
the clattering of cutlery and crockery succeed. Cuf-&#xD;

an involuntary impulse of delight; Neily shakes her&#xD;
finger at Sambo and laughs, she knows not why, and&#xD;
so the fun and merriment flows on.&#xD;
When the viands have disappeared, and the hungry&#xD;
maws of the children of toil are satisfied, then, next&#xD;
in the order of amusement, is the Christmas dance.&#xD;
My business on these gala days always was to play on&#xD;
the violin. The African race is a music-loving one,&#xD;
proverbially; and many there were among my fellow-&#xD;
bondsmen whose organs of tune were strikingly devel-&#xD;
oped, and who could thumb the banjo with dexterity;&#xD;
but at the expense of appearing egotistical, I must,&#xD;
nevertheless, declare, that I was considered the Ole&#xD;
Bull of Bayou Boeuf. My master often received let-&#xD;
ters, sometimes from a distance of ten miles, request-&#xD;
ing him to send me to play at a ball or festival of the&#xD;
whites. He received his compensation, and usually I&#xD;
also returned with many picayunes jingling in my&#xD;
pockets - the extra contributions of those to whose&#xD;
delight I had administered.' In this manner I became&#xD;
more acquainted than I otherwise would, up and down&#xD;
the bayou. The young men and maidens of Holmes-&#xD;
ville always knew there was to be a jollification some-&#xD;
where, whenever Platt Epps was seen passing through&#xD;
the town with his fiddle in his hand. "Where are&#xD;
you going now, Platt ?" and "What is coming off to-&#xD;
night, Platt ?" would be interrogatories issuing from&#xD;
every door and window, and many a time when there&#xD;
was no special hurry, yielding to pressing importuni-&#xD;

his mule, perhaps, discourse musically to a crowd&#xD;
of delighted children, gathered around him in the&#xD;
street.&#xD;
Alas! had it not been for my beloved violin, I scarce-&#xD;
ly can conceive how I could have endured the long&#xD;
years of bondage. It introduced me to great houses&#xD;
-relieved me of many days' labor in the field -sup-&#xD;

pipes and tobacco, and extra pairs of shoes, and often-&#xD;
times led iie away from the presence of a hard mas-&#xD;

melodious consolations when I was sad. Often, at&#xD;
midnight, when sleep had fled affrighted from the&#xD;
cabin, and my soul was disturbed and troubled with&#xD;
the contemplation of my fate, it would sing me a song&#xD;
of peace. On holy Sabbath days, when an hour or&#xD;

up its voice, discourse kindly and pleasantly indeed,&#xD;

upon the celerity, if not the " poetry of motion"--&#xD;
upon genuine happiness, rampant and unrestrained--&#xD;
go down to Louisiana, and see the slaves dancing in&#xD;
the starlight of a Christmas night.&#xD;
On that particular Christmas I have now in my&#xD;
mind, a description whereof will serve as a descrip-&#xD;
tion of the day generally, Miss Lively and Mir. Sam,&#xD;
the first belonging to Stewart, the latter to Roberts,&#xD;
started the ball. It was well known that Sam cher-&#xD;
ished an ardent passion for Lively, as also did one of&#xD;
Marshall's and another of Carey's boys ; for Lively&#xD;
was lively indeed, and a heart-breaking coquette with-&#xD;
al. It was a victory for Sam Roberts, when, rising&#xD;
from the repast, she gave him her hand for the f est&#xD;
" fign e" in preference to either of his rivals. T ,ey&#xD;
were somewhat crest-fallen, and, shaking their b ads&#xD;
angrily, rather intimated they would like to pitcl into&#xD;
Mr. Sam and hurt him badly. But not an en nation&#xD;
of wrath ruffled the placid bosom of Samuel as his&#xD;
legs flew like drum-sticks down the outside mnd up&#xD;
the middle, by the side of his bewitching ,artner.&#xD;
The whole company cheered them vociferously, an,&#xD;
excited with the applause, they continued " tearing&#xD;
down" after all the others had become exhausted and&#xD;
halted a moment .to recover breath. But Sam's su~-&#xD;
perhuman exertions overcame him finally, leaving&#xD;
Lively alone, yet whirling like a top. Thereupon one&#xD;
of Sam's rivals, Pete Marshall, dashed in, and, with&#xD;
might and main, leaped and shuffled and threw him-&#xD;
self into every conceivable shape, as if determined to&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
show Miss Lively and all the world that Sam Roberts&#xD;
was of no account.&#xD;
Pete's affection, however, was greater than his dis-&#xD;
cretion. Such violent exercise took the breath out of&#xD;
him directly, and lie dropped like an empty bag.&#xD;
Then was the time for Harry Carey to try his hand ;&#xD;
but Lively also soon out-winded him, amidst hurrahs&#xD;
and shouts, fully sustaining her well-earned reputation&#xD;
of being the "fastest gal" on the bayou.&#xD;
One " set" off, another takes its place, he or she re-&#xD;
maining longest on the floor receiving the most up-&#xD;

until broad daylight. It does not cease 'with the&#xD;
sound11 of the fiddle, but in that case they set up a mu-&#xD;
sic peculiar to themselves. This is called "patting,"&#xD;
accompanied with one of those unmeaning songs,&#xD;
composed rather for its adaptation to a certain tune&#xD;
or measure, than for the purpose of expressing any&#xD;
distinct idea.. The patting is performed by striking&#xD;
the hands on the knees, then striking the hands to-&#xD;
gether, then striking the right shoulder with one&#xD;
Land, the left with the other - all the while keeping&#xD;
time with the feet, and singing, perhaps, this sonig:&#xD;

which case they are paid for it. It is vey rarely,&#xD;
however, that the latter alternative is a   pte.&#xD;
They may be seen at these times hurrying in all di&#xD;
reactions, as happy looking mortals as can be found&#xD;
of the face of the earth. They are different beings&#xD;
from what they are in the field; the temporary re-&#xD;
laxation, the brief deliverance from fear, and from&#xD;
the lash, producing an entire metamorphosis in their&#xD;
appearance and demeanor. In visiting, riding, renew-&#xD;
ig old friendships, or, perchance, reviving some old&#xD;
attachment, or pursuing whatever pleasure may sug-&#xD;
gest itself, the time is occupied. Such is "southern&#xD;
life as it is," three days in the year, as I found it.--&#xD;
the other three hundred and sixty-two being days&#xD;
of weariness, and fear, and sufering, and unremit-&#xD;
ting labor.&#xD;
Marriage is frequently contracted during the holi-&#xD;
days, if such an institution may be said to exist&#xD;
among them. The only ceremony required before&#xD;
entering into that "holy estate," is to obtain the con-&#xD;
sent of the respective owners. It is usually encour-&#xD;
aged by the masters of female slaves. Either party&#xD;
can have as many husbandsor wives as the owner&#xD;
will permit, and either is at liberty to discard the&#xD;
other at pleasure. The law in relation to divorce, or&#xD;
to bigamy, and so forth, is not applicable to property,&#xD;
of course. If the wife does not belong on the same&#xD;
plantation with the husband, the latter is permitted&#xD;
to visit her on Saturday nights, if the distance is not&#xD;
too far.- Uncle Abram's wife lived seven miles from,&#xD;

WITI the exception of my trip to St. Mary's parish,&#xD;
and my absence during the cane-cutting seasons, I&#xD;
was constantly employed on the plantation of Master&#xD;
Epps. He was considered but a small planter, not&#xD;
having a sufficient number of hands to require the&#xD;
services of an overseer, acting in the latter capacity&#xD;
himself.   Not able to increase his force, it was his&#xD;
custom to hire during the hurry-of cotton-picking.&#xD;
On larger estates, employing fifty or a hundred, or&#xD;
perhaps two, hundred hands, an- overseer is deemed&#xD;
indispensable.   These gentlemen ride into the field&#xD;
on horseback, without an exception,to my knowledge,&#xD;
armed with pistols, bowie knife, whip, and accompa-&#xD;
nied by several dogs.     They follow, equipped in this&#xD;
fashion, in rear of the slaves, keeping a sharp lookout&#xD;

upon them   all. The requisite qualifications in an&#xD;
overseer are utter heartlessness, brutality and cruelty.&#xD;
It is his business to produce large crops, and if that is&#xD;
accomplished, no matter what amount of suffering it&#xD;
may have cost. The presence of the dogs are neces-&#xD;
sary to overhaul a fugitive who may take to his heels,&#xD;
as is sometimes the case, when faint or sick, lie is un-&#xD;
able to maintin his row, and unable, also, to en-&#xD;
dure the whip. The pistols are reserved for any dan-&#xD;
gerous emergency, there having been instances when&#xD;
such weapons were necessary. Goaded into uncon-&#xD;
trollable madness, even the slave will sometimes turn&#xD;
upon his oppressor. The gallows were standing at&#xD;
Marksville last January, upon which one was execu-&#xD;
ted a year ago for killing his overseer. It occurred&#xD;
not many miles from Epps' plantation on Red iRiver.&#xD;
The slave was given his task at splitting rails. In&#xD;
the course of the day the overseer sent him on an&#xD;
errand, which occupied so much time that it was not&#xD;
possible for him to perform the task. The next day&#xD;
he was called to an account, but the loss of time oc-&#xD;
casioned by the errand was no excuse, and he was&#xD;
ordered to kneel and bare his back for the reception&#xD;
of the lash. They were in the woods alone -beyond&#xD;
the reach of sight or hearing. The boy submitted&#xD;
until maddened at such injustice, and insane with&#xD;
pain, he sprang to his feet, and seizing an axe, liter-,&#xD;
ally chopped the overseer in pieces. He made no at-&#xD;
tempt whatever at concealment, but hastening to his&#xD;
master, related the whole affair, and declared himself&#xD;

ready to expiate the wrong by the sacrifice of his life.&#xD;
He was led to the scaffold, and while the rope was&#xD;
around his neck, maintained an undismayed and&#xD;
fearless bearing, and with his last words justified the&#xD;
act.&#xD;
Besides the overseer, there are drivers under him,&#xD;
the number being in proportion to the number of&#xD;
hands in the field. The drivers are black, who, in&#xD;
addition to the performance of their equal share of&#xD;
work, are compelled to do the whipping of their&#xD;
several gangs. . Whips hang around their necks, and&#xD;
if they fail to use them thoroughly, are whipped&#xD;
themselves. They have a few privileges, however;&#xD;
for example, in cane-cutting the hands are not allow-&#xD;
ed to sit down long enough to eat their dinners. Carts&#xD;
filled with corn cake, cooked at the kitchen, are driv-&#xD;
en into the field at noon., The cake is distributed by&#xD;
the drivers, and must be eaten with the least possible&#xD;
delay.&#xD;
When the slave ceases- to perspire, as he often does&#xD;
when taxed beyond his strength, lie falls to the ground&#xD;
and becomes entirely helpless. It is then the duty&#xD;
of the driver to drag him into the shade of the stand-&#xD;
ing cotton or cane, or of a neighboring tree, where&#xD;
he dashes buckets of water upon him, and uses other&#xD;
means of bringing out perspiration again, when he is&#xD;
ordered to his place, and compelled to continue his&#xD;
labor.&#xD;
At 'Huff Power, when I first came to Epps', Tom,&#xD;
one of Roberts' negroes, was driver. He was a burly&#xD;

fellow, and severe in the extreme. After Epps' re..&#xD;
moval to Bayou Bceuf, that distinguished honor was&#xD;
conferred upon myself. Up to the time of my de-&#xD;
parture I had to wear a whip about my neck in the&#xD;
field. If Epps was present, I dared not show any&#xD;
lenity, not having the Christian fortitude of a certain&#xD;
well-known Uncle Tom sufficiently to brave his wrath,&#xD;
by refusing to perform the office. In that way, only,&#xD;
I escaped the immediate martyrdom he suffered, and,&#xD;
withal, saved my companions much suffering, as it&#xD;
proved in the end. Epps, I soon found, whether&#xD;
actually in the field or not, had his eyes pretty gen-&#xD;
erally upon us. From the piazza, from behind some&#xD;
adjacent tree, or other concealed point of observation,&#xD;
he was perpetually on the watch. If one of us had&#xD;
been backward or idle through the day, we were apt&#xD;
to be told all about it on returning to the quarters,&#xD;
and as it was a matter of principle with him to re-&#xD;
prove every offence of that kind that came within his&#xD;
knowledge, the offender not only was certain of re-&#xD;
ceiving a castigation for his tardiness, but I likewise&#xD;
was punished for permitting it.&#xD;
If, on the other hand, he had seen me use the lash&#xD;
freely, the man was satisfied. "Practice makes per-&#xD;
fect," truly ; and during my eight years' experience&#xD;
as a driver, I learned to handle the whip with mar-&#xD;
velous dexterity and precision, throwing the lash&#xD;
within a hair's breadth of the back, the ear, the nose,&#xD;
without, however, touching either of them. If Epps&#xD;
was observed at a distance, or we had reason to ap-&#xD;
&#xD;
APPOINTED DRIVER.           227&#xD;
pretend he was sneaking somewhere in the vicinity,&#xD;
I would commence plying the lash vigorously; when,&#xD;
according to arrangement, they would squirm and&#xD;
screech as if in agony, although not one of them had&#xD;
in fact been even grazed. Patsey would take occa-&#xD;
sion, if he made his appearance presently, to mumble&#xD;
in his hearing some complaints that Platt was lash-&#xD;
ing them the whole time, and Uncle Abram, with an&#xD;
appearance of honesty peculiar to himself, would de-&#xD;
clare roundly I had just whipped them worse than&#xD;
General Jackson whipped the enemy at New-Orleans.&#xD;
If Epps was not drunk, and in one of his beastly hu-&#xD;
mors, this was, in general, satisfactory. If he was,&#xD;
some one or more of us must suffer as a matter of&#xD;
course. Sometimes his violence assumed a dangerous&#xD;
form, placing the lives of his human stock in jeop-&#xD;
ardy. On one occasion the drunken madman thought&#xD;
to amuse himself by cutting my throat.&#xD;
He had been absent at Holmesville, in attendance at&#xD;
a shooting-match, and none of us were aware of his&#xD;
return. While hoeing by the side of Patsey, she ex-&#xD;
claimed, in a low voice, suddenly, "Platt, d'ye see&#xD;
old Hog-Jaw beckoning me to come to him ?"&#xD;
Glancing sideways, I discovered him in the edge&#xD;
of the field, motioning and grimacing, as was his habit&#xD;
when half-intoxicated. Aware of his lewd intentions,&#xD;
Patsey began to-cry. I whispered her not to look up,&#xD;
and to continue at her work, as if she had not ob-&#xD;
served him. Suspecting the truth of the matter,&#xD;
however, he soon staggered up to me in a great rage.&#xD;

<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC7339-00000118"/>&#xD;
228          TWELVE YEAiS A SLAVE.&#xD;
" What did you say to Pats ?" he demanded, with&#xD;
an oath. I made him some evasive answer, which&#xD;
only had the effect of increasing his violence.&#xD;
" How long have you owned this plantation, say,&#xD;
you d-d nigger ?" he inquired, with a malicious&#xD;
sneer, at the same time taking hold of my shirt col-&#xD;
lar with one hand, and thrusting the other into his&#xD;
pocket. "Now I'll cut your black throat ; that's&#xD;
what I'll do," drawing his knife from his pocket as&#xD;
he said it. But with one hand lie was unable to&#xD;
open it, until finally seizing the blade in his teeth, I&#xD;
saw he was about to succeed, and felt the necessity&#xD;
of escaping from him, for in his present reckless state,&#xD;
it was evident he was not joking, by any means. My&#xD;
shirt was open in front, and as I turned round quickly&#xD;
and sprang froin him, while he still retained his gripe,,&#xD;
it was stripped entirely from my back. There was&#xD;
no difficulty now in eluding him. ie would chase&#xD;
me until out of breath, then stop until it was recov-&#xD;
Ared, swear, and renew the chase again.. Now he&#xD;
would command me to come to him, now endeavor-&#xD;
to coax me, but I was careful to keep at a respectful&#xD;
distance. In this mannei' we made the circuit of the&#xD;
field several times, he making desperate plunges, and&#xD;
I always dodging them, more amused than frightened,&#xD;
well knowing that when his sober senses returned,&#xD;
he would laugh at his own drunken folly. At length&#xD;
I observed the mistress standing by the yard fence,&#xD;
watching our half-serious, half-comical maneuvres.&#xD;
Shooting past him, I ran directly to her. Epps, on&#xD;
&#xD;
4LS&#xD;
&#xD;
PROTECTED BY THE MISTRESS.       229&#xD;
&#xD;
discovering her, did not follow. lIe remained about&#xD;
the field an hour or more, during which time I stood&#xD;
by the mistress, having related the particulars of&#xD;
what had taken place. Now, she was aroused again,&#xD;
denouncing her husband and Patsey about equally.&#xD;
Finally, Epps came towards the house, by this time&#xD;
nearly sober, walking demurely, with his hands be-&#xD;
hind his back, and attempting to Ipok as innocent as&#xD;
a child.&#xD;
As he approached, nevertheless, Mistress Epps be-&#xD;
gan to berate him roundly, heaping upon him many&#xD;
rather disrespectful epithets, and demanding for what&#xD;
reason he had attempted to cut my throat. Epps&#xD;
made wondrous strange of it all, and to my surprise,&#xD;
swore by all the saints in , the calendar he had not&#xD;
spoken to me that day.&#xD;
" Platt, you lying nigger, ave I ?" was his brazen&#xD;
appeal to me.&#xD;
It is not safe to contradict a master, even by the&#xD;
assertion of a truth. So I was silent, and when he en-&#xD;
tered the house I returned to the field, and the affair&#xD;
was never after alluded to.&#xD;
Shortly after this time a circumstance occurred that&#xD;
came nigh divulging the secret of my real name and&#xD;
history, which I had so long and carefully concealed,&#xD;
and upon which I was convinced depended my final&#xD;
escape. Soon after he purchased me, Epps asked&#xD;
me if I could write and read, and on being informed&#xD;
that I had received some instruction in those branches&#xD;
of education, he assured me, with emphasis, if lie ever&#xD;

caught me with a book, or with pen and ink, he would&#xD;
give rme a hundred lashes. He said he wanted me to&#xD;
understand that he bought "niggers" to work and not&#xD;
to educate. le never inquired a word of my past&#xD;
life, or from whence I came. The mistress, however,&#xD;
cross-examined me frequently about Washington,&#xD;
which she supposed was my native city, and more&#xD;
than once remarked that I did not talk nor act like&#xD;
the other "niggers," and she was sure I had seen more&#xD;
of the world than I admitted.&#xD;
My great object always was to invent means of get-&#xD;
ting a letter secretly into the post-office, directed to&#xD;
some of my friends or family at the North. The diffi-&#xD;
culty of such an achievement cannot be comprehend-&#xD;
ed by one unacquainted with the severe restrictions&#xD;
imposed upon me. In the first place, I was deprived&#xD;
of pen, ink, and paper. In the second place, a slave&#xD;
cannot leave his plantation without a pass, nor will a&#xD;
post-master mail a letter for one without written in-&#xD;
structions from his owner. . I was in slavery nine&#xD;
years, and always watchful and on the alert, before I&#xD;
met with the good fortune of obtaining a sheet of pa-&#xD;
per. While Epps was in New-Orleans, one winter,&#xD;
disposing of his cotton, the mistress sent me to Hohnes-&#xD;
yule, with an order for several articles, and among&#xD;
the rest a quantity of foolscap. I appropriated a sheet-&#xD;
concealing it in the cabin, under the board on which&#xD;
I slept.&#xD;
After various experiments I succeeded in making&#xD;
ink, by boiling white maple bark, and with a feather&#xD;

j   ked from the wing of a duck, manufactured a&#xD;
pen. When all were asleep in the cabin by the light&#xD;
of the coals, lying upon my plank couch, I managed&#xD;
to complete a somewhat lengthy epistle. It was di-&#xD;
rected to an old acquaintance at Sandy HllU, stating&#xD;
my condition, and urging him to take measures to re&#xD;
store me to liberty. This letter I kept a long time,&#xD;
contriving measures by which it could be, safely de-&#xD;
posited in the post-office. At length, a low fellow, by&#xD;
the nque of Armsby, hitherto a stranger, came into&#xD;
the r1xighboriood, seeking a situation as Overseer&#xD;
lIe applied to Epps, and was about the plantation for&#xD;
sever l days. He next went over to Shaw's, near by,&#xD;
and remained with him several weeks. Shaw was&#xD;
gen'-ally surrounded by such worthless characters&#xD;
beiiig himself noted as a gambler and unprincipled&#xD;
ma1n. le had made a wife of his slave Charlotte, and&#xD;
a L1'ood of young mulattoes were growing up in his&#xD;
house. Armsby became so much reduced at last,&#xD;
that lie was compelled to labor with the slaves. A&#xD;
white man working in the field is a rare and unusual&#xD;
spectacle on Bayou Bceuf. I improved every oppor-&#xD;
tunity of cultivating his acquaintance privately, de-&#xD;
siring to obtain his confidence so far as to be willing&#xD;
to intrust the letter to his keeping. He visited Marks-&#xD;
ville repeatedly, lie informed me, a town some twenty&#xD;
miles distant, and there, I proposed to myself, the let-&#xD;
ter should be mailed.&#xD;
Carefully deliberating on the most proper manner&#xD;
of approaching him on the subject, I conchided final-&#xD;

EPPs' SUSPICIONS.             233&#xD;

&#xD;
ly to ask him simply if he would deposit a letter for&#xD;
me in the Marksville post-office the next time he vis-&#xD;
ited that place, without disclosing to him that the let-&#xD;
ter was written, or any of the particulars it contained;&#xD;
for I had fears that he might betray me, and knew&#xD;
that some inducement must be held out to him of a&#xD;
pecuniary nature, before it would be safe to confide&#xD;
in him. As late as one o'clock one night I stole noise-&#xD;
lessly from my cabin, and, crossing the field to Shaw's,&#xD;
found him sleeping on the piazza. I had but a few&#xD;
picayunes - the proceeds of my fiddling performan.&#xD;
ces, but all I had in the world I promised him if he&#xD;
would do me the favor required. I begged him not&#xD;
to expose me if he could not grant the request. He&#xD;
assured me, upon his honor, lie would deposit it in the&#xD;
Marksville post-office, and that he would keep it an&#xD;
inviolable secret forever. Though the letter was in&#xD;
my pocket at the time, I dared not then deliver it to&#xD;
him, but stating I would have it written in a day or&#xD;
two, bade him good night, and returned to my cab-&#xD;
in. It was impossible for me to expel the suspicions&#xD;
I entertained, and all night I lay awake, revolving in&#xD;
my mind the safest course to pursue. I was willing&#xD;
to risk a great deal to accomplish my purpose, but-&#xD;
should the letter by any means fall into the hands of&#xD;
Epps, it would be a death-blow to my aspirations. I&#xD;
was " perplexed in the extreme."&#xD;
My suspicions were well-founded, as the sequel de-&#xD;
monstrated. The next day but one, while scraping cot-&#xD;
ton in the field, Epps seated himself on the line fence&#xD;
&#xD;
between Shaw's plantation and his own, in such a po-&#xD;
sition as to overlook the scene of our labors. Pres-&#xD;
ently Armsby made his appearance, and, mounting&#xD;
the fence, took a seat beside him. They remained&#xD;
two or three hours, all of which time I was in an ag-&#xD;
ony of apprehension.&#xD;
That night, while broiling my bacon, Epps' entered&#xD;
the cabin with his rawhide in his hand.&#xD;
"Well, boy," said he, "I understand I've got a&#xD;
larned nigger, that writes letters, and tries to get&#xD;
white fellows to mail 'em. Wonder if you know who&#xD;
he is ?"&#xD;
My worst fears were realized, and although it may&#xD;
not be considered entirely creditable, even under the&#xD;
circumstances, yet a resort to duplicity and downright&#xD;
falsehood was the only refuge that presented itself.&#xD;
"Don't know nothing about it, Master Eppe," I an-&#xD;
swered him, assuming an air of ignorance and sur-&#xD;
prise ; " Don't know nothing at all about it, sir."&#xD;
"Wan't you over to Shaw's night before last ?" he&#xD;
inquired.&#xD;
" No, master," was the reply.&#xD;
"Iav'nt you asked that fellow, Armsby, to mail a&#xD;
letter for you at Marksville ?"&#xD;
" Why, Lord, master, I never spoke three words.to&#xD;
him in all my life. I don't know what you mean."&#xD;
" Well," he continued, "Armsby told me to-day the&#xD;
devil was among .my niggers ; that I had one that&#xD;
needed close, watching or he would run away; and&#xD;
when I axed him why, he said you come over to&#xD;

&#xD;
Shaw's, and waked him up in the night, and wanted&#xD;
him to carry a letter to Marksville. What have yonu&#xD;
got to say to that, ha ?"&#xD;
" All I've got to say, master," I replied, "is, there&#xD;
is no truth in it. How could I write a letter without&#xD;
any ink or paper? There is nobody I want to write&#xD;
to, 'cause I haint got no friends living as I know of.&#xD;
That Armsby is a lying, drunken fellow, they say, and&#xD;
nobody believes him anyway. You know I always&#xD;
tell the truth, and that I never go off the plantation&#xD;
without a pass. Now, master, I can see what that&#xD;
Armsby is after, plain enough. Did'nt he want you&#xD;
to hire him for an overseers'&#xD;
"Yes, he wanted me to hire him," answered Epps.&#xD;
"That's it," said I, "he wants to make you believe&#xD;
we're all going to run away, and then he thinks you'll&#xD;
lire an overseer to watch us. He just made that sto-&#xD;
ry out of whole cloth, 'cause he wants to get a situa-&#xD;
tion. It's all a lie, master, you may depend on't."&#xD;
Epps mused awhile, evidently impressed with the&#xD;
plausibility of my theory, and exclaimed,.&#xD;
"I'm d-d, Platt, if I don't believe you tell the&#xD;
truth. Ile must take me for a soft, to think he can&#xD;
come it over me with them kind of yarns, musn't he?&#xD;
Maybe he thinks he can fool me ; maybe he thinks&#xD;
I don't know nothing-can't take care of my own&#xD;
niggers, eh! Soft soap old Epps, eh! ha, ha, ha!&#xD;
D-n Armsby! Set the dogs on him, Platt," and&#xD;
with many other comments descriptive of Armsby's&#xD;
general character, and his capability of taking care of&#xD;
&#xD;
his own business, and attending tohis own "niggers,"&#xD;
Master Epps left the cabin. As soon as he was gone&#xD;
I threw the letter in the fire, and, with a desponding&#xD;
and despairing heart, beheld the epistle which had&#xD;
cost me so much anxiety and thought; and which I&#xD;
fondly hoped would have been my forerunner to the&#xD;
land of freedom, writhe and shrivel on its bed or coals,&#xD;
,and dissolve into smoke and ashes. Armsby, the&#xD;
treacherous wretch, was driven from Shaw's planta-&#xD;
tion not long subsequently, much to my relief, for I&#xD;
feared he might renew his conversation, and perhaps&#xD;
induce Epps to credit him.&#xD;
I knew not now whither to look for deliverance.&#xD;
Hopes sprang up in my heart only to be crushed and&#xD;
blighted. The summer of my life was passing away.;&#xD;
I felt I was growing prematurely old ; that a few&#xD;
years more, and toil, and grief, and the poisonous mi-&#xD;
asmas of the swamps would accomplish their work&#xD;
upon me - would consign me to the grave's embrace,&#xD;
to moulder and be forgotten. Repelled, betrayed, cut&#xD;
off from the hope of succor, I could only prostrate&#xD;
myself upon the, earth and groan in unutterable an-&#xD;
guish. The hope of rescue was the only light that&#xD;
cast a ray of comfort on my heart. That was now&#xD;
flickering, faint and low; another breath of disap-&#xD;
pointment would."extinguish it altogether, leaving me&#xD;
to grope in midnight darkness to the end of life.&#xD;

TIIE TRAITOR -THE IDEA OF INSURRECTION.&#xD;
Tmn year 1850, down to which time I have now ar-&#xD;
rived, omitting many occurrences uninteresting to the&#xD;
reader, was an unlucky year for my companion Wiley,&#xD;
the husband of Phebe, whose taciturn and retiring&#xD;
nature has thus far kept him in the background.       Not-&#xD;
withstanding Wiley seldom opened his mouth, and&#xD;
revolved in his obscure and unpretending orbit with-&#xD;
out a grumble, nevertheless the warm elements of so-&#xD;
ciality were strong in the bosom     of that silent "nig-&#xD;
ger."   In the exuberance of his self-reliance, disre-&#xD;
garding the philosophy of Uncle Abram, and setting&#xD;
the counsels of Aunt Phebe utterly at naught, he had&#xD;
the fool-hardiness to essay a nocturnal visit to a neigh-&#xD;
boring cabin without a pass.      _&#xD;
&#xD;
.1&#xD;
&#xD;
WILEY'S INDISCRETION.&#xD;
&#xD;
So attractive was the society in which he found&#xD;
himself, that Wiley took little note of the passing&#xD;
hours, and the light began to break in the east before&#xD;
he was aware. Speeding homeward as fast as he&#xD;
could run, he hoped to reach the quarters before the&#xD;
horn would sound ; but, unhappily, he was spied on&#xD;
the way by a company of patrollers.&#xD;
How it is in other dark places of slavery, I do not&#xD;
know, but on Bayou Buf there is' an organization of&#xD;
patrollers, as they are styled, whose business it is to&#xD;
seize and whip any slave they may find wandering&#xD;
from the plantation. They ride on horseback, headed&#xD;
by a captain, armed, and accompanied by dogs. They&#xD;
have the right, either by law, or by general consent,&#xD;
to inflict discretionary chastisement upon a black man&#xD;
caught beyond the boundaries of his master's estate&#xD;
without a pass, and even to shoot him, if lie attempts&#xD;
to escape. Each company has a certain distance to&#xD;
ride up and down the bayou. They are conpens-ated&#xD;
by the planters, who contribute in proportion to the&#xD;
number of slaves they own. The clatter of their hor-&#xD;
ses' hoofs dashing by can be heard at all hours of the&#xD;
night, and frequently they may be seen driving a&#xD;
slave before them, or leading him by a rope fastened&#xD;
around his neck, to, his owner's plantation.&#xD;
Wiley fled before one of these companies, thinking&#xD;
he could reach his cabin before they could overtake&#xD;
him; but one of their dogs, agreat ravenous hound,&#xD;
griped him by the leg, and held him fast. The pa-&#xD;
trciers whipped him severely, and brought him, a&#xD;

WILEY's CAPTUREL ON 1ED IVR.    239&#xD;
&#xD;
prisoner, to Epps. From him lie received another&#xD;
flagellation still more severe, so that the'cuts of the&#xD;
lash and the bites of the dog rendered him sore, stiff&#xD;
and miserable, insomuch lie was scarcely able to move.&#xD;
It was impossible in such a state to keep ulp his row,&#xD;
and consequently there was not an hour in the day-&#xD;
but Wiley felt the sting of his master's rawhide on&#xD;
his raw and bleeding back. His sufferings became&#xD;
intolerable, and finally he resolved to run away.&#xD;
Without disclosing his intentions to run away even&#xD;
to his wife Phebe, he proceeded to make arrange-&#xD;
ments for carrying his plan into execution. having&#xD;
cooked his whole week's allowance, he cautiously left&#xD;
the cabin on a Sunday night, after the inmates of the&#xD;
quarters were asleep. When the horn sounded in the&#xD;
morning, Wiley did not make his appearance. Search&#xD;
was made for him in thcabins, in the corn-crib, in&#xD;
the cotton-house, and in eve y nook and corner of the,&#xD;
premises. Each of us was examined, touching any&#xD;
knowledge we might have that could throw light upon&#xD;
his sudden disappearance or present whereabouts.&#xD;
Epps raved and stormed, and mounting his horse, gal-&#xD;
loped to neighboring plantations, making inquiries&#xD;
in all directions. The search was fruitless. Nothing&#xD;
whatever was elicited, going to show what had be-&#xD;
come of the missing man. The dogs were led to the&#xD;
swamp, but were unable to strike his trail. They&#xD;
would circle away through the forest, their noses to&#xD;
the ground, but invariably returned in a short time&#xD;
to the spot from whence they started.&#xD;
&#xD;
Wiley had escaped, and so secretly and cautiously&#xD;
as to elude and baffle all pursuit. Days and even&#xD;
weeks passed away, and nothing could be heard of&#xD;
him. Epps did nothing but curse and swear. It was&#xD;
the only topic of conversation among us when alone.&#xD;
We indulged in a great deal of speculation in regard&#xD;
to him, one suggesting he might have been drowned&#xD;
in some bayou, inasmuch as he was a poor swimmer;&#xD;
another, that perhaps he might have been devoured&#xD;
by alligators, or stung by the. venomous moccasin,&#xD;
whose bito is certain and sudden death. The warm&#xD;
and hearty sympathies of -us all, however, were&#xD;
with poor Wiley, wherever he might be. Many an&#xD;
earnest prayer ascended from the lips of Uncle Abram,&#xD;
beseeching safety for the wanderer.&#xD;
In about three weeks, whin all hope of ever seeing&#xD;
him again was dismissed, to our surprise, he one day&#xD;
appeared among us. On leaving the plantation, lie&#xD;
informed us, it was his intention to make his way&#xD;
back to South Carolina - to the old quarters of Mas-&#xD;
ter Buford. During the day he remained secreted,&#xD;
sometimes in the branches of a tree, and at night&#xD;
pressed forward through the swamps. Finally, one&#xD;
morning, just at dawn, he' reached the shore of Red&#xD;
River. While standing on the bank, considering how&#xD;
lie could cross it, a white man accosted him, and de-&#xD;
manded a pass. Without one, and evidently a runa-&#xD;
way, he was taken to Alexandria, the shire town of&#xD;
the parish of IRapidos, and confined in prison. It&#xD;
happened severI days after that Joseph 713. Roberts,&#xD;

&#xD;
uncle of Mistress Epps, was in Alexandria, and going&#xD;
into the jail, recognized him. Wiley had worked on&#xD;
his plantation, when Epps resided at huff Power.&#xD;
Paying the jail fee, and writing him a pass, under-&#xD;
neath which was a note to Epps, requesting him not&#xD;
to whip him on his return, Wiley was sent back to&#xD;
Bayou Bceuf. It was the hope that hung upon this&#xD;
request, and which Roberts assured him would be re-.&#xD;
spected by his master, that sustained hin as he ap-&#xD;
proached the house. The request, however, as may&#xD;
be readily supposed, was entirely disregarded. After&#xD;
being kept in suspense three days, Wiley Was stripped,&#xD;
and compelled to endure one of those inhuman flog-&#xD;
gings to which the poor slave is so often subjected.&#xD;
It was the first and last attempt of Wiley to run away.&#xD;
The long scars upon his back, which he will carry&#xD;
with him to the grave, perpetually remind him of the&#xD;
dangers of such a step.&#xD;
There was not a day throughout the ten years Ihoe-&#xD;
longed to Epps that I did not consult with myself upon&#xD;
the prospect of escape. I laid many plans, which at&#xD;
the time I considered excellent ones, but one after the&#xD;
other they were all abandoned. No man who has&#xD;
never been placed in such a situation, can comprehend&#xD;
the thousand obstacles thrown in the way of the flying&#xD;
slave. Every white man's hand is raised against him&#xD;
- the patrollers are watching for him-the hounds&#xD;
are ready to follow on his track, and the nature of&#xD;
the country is such as renders it impossible to pass&#xD;
through it with any safety. I thoulit, however, that&#xD;
&#xD;
FUGIPIVEs IN THE PINE WOODS.     241&#xD;
the time might come, perhaps, when I should be run-&#xD;
ing through the swamps again. I concluded, in that&#xD;
case, to be prepared for Epps' dogs, should they pur-&#xD;
sue me. He possessed several, one of which was a&#xD;
notorious slave-hunter, and.the most fierce and savage&#xD;
of his breed. _ While out hunting the coon -or the&#xD;
opossum, I never allowed an opportunity to escape,&#xD;
when alone, of whipping them severely. In this man-&#xD;
ner I succeeded at length in subduing them, com-&#xD;
pletely. They feared me, obeying my voice at once&#xD;
when others had no control over them whatever.&#xD;
Had they followed and overtaken me, I doubt not&#xD;
they would have shrank from attacking me.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the certainty of being captured,&#xD;
the woods and swamps are, nevertheless, continually&#xD;
filled with runaways. Many of them, when sick, or&#xD;
so worn out as to be unable to perform their tasks,&#xD;
escape into the swamps, willing to suffer the punish-&#xD;
ment inflicted for such offences, in order to obtain a&#xD;
day or two of rest.&#xD;
While I belonged to Ford, I was unwittingly the&#xD;
means of disclosing the hiding-placeof six or eight,&#xD;
who had taken up their residence in the "Great Pine&#xD;
Woods." Adam Taydem frequently sent me from&#xD;
the mills over to the opening after provisions. The&#xD;
whole distance was then a thick pine forest. About&#xD;
ten o'clock of a beautiful moonlight night, while&#xD;
walking along the Texas road, returning to the mills,&#xD;
carrying a dressed pig in a bag swung over my&#xD;
shoulder, I heard footsteps behind re, and turning&#xD;

AUGUSTUS KILLED BY DOGS.        243&#xD;

242          TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;

rouid, beheld two black men in the dress of slaves&#xD;
approaching at a rapid pace. When within a short&#xD;
distance, one of them raised a club, as if intending to&#xD;
strike me; the other snatched at the bag. I managed&#xD;
to dodge them both, and seizing a pine knot, hurled&#xD;
it with such force against the head of one of them&#xD;
that he was prostrated apparently senseless .to the&#xD;
ground. Just then two more made their appearance&#xD;
from one side of the road. Before they could grapple&#xD;
me, however, I succeeded in passing them, and taking&#xD;
to my heels, fled, much affrighted, towards the mills.&#xD;
When Adam was informed of the adventure, he&#xD;
hastened straightway to the Indian village, and arous-&#xD;
ing Cascalla and several of his tribe, started in pur-&#xD;
suit of the highwaymen. I accompanied them to the&#xD;
scene of attack, when we discovered, a puddle of&#xD;
blood in the road, where the man whom I had smit-&#xD;
ten with the pine knot had fallen. After searching&#xD;
carefully through the woods a long time, one of Cas-&#xD;
calla's men discovered a smoke curling up through&#xD;
the branches of several prostrate pines, whose tops&#xD;
had fallen together. The rendezvous was cautiously&#xD;
surrounded, and all of them taken prisoners. They&#xD;
had escaped from a plantation in the vicinity of La-&#xD;
mourie, and had been secreted there three weeks.&#xD;
They had no evil design upon me, except to frighten&#xD;
me out of my pig. Having observed me passing&#xD;
towards Ford's just at night-fall, and suspecting the&#xD;
nature of my errand, they had followed me, seen me&#xD;
butcher and dress the porker, and start on my return.&#xD;
&#xD;
They had been pinched for food, and were driven&#xD;
to this extremity by necessity. Adam conveyed&#xD;
them to the parish jail, and was liberally rewarded.&#xD;
Not unfrequently the runaway loses his life in thc&#xD;
attempt to escape. Epps' premises were bounded ct&#xD;
one side by Carey's, a very extensive sugar planta-&#xD;
tion. He cultivates annually at least fifteen hundred&#xD;
acres of cane, manufacturing twenty-two or twenty-&#xD;
three hundred hogsheads of sugar; an hogshead and&#xD;
a half being the usual yield of an acre. Besides this&#xD;
he also cultivates five or six hundred acres of corn and&#xD;
cotton. He owned last year one hundred and fifty&#xD;
three field hands, besides nearly as many children, and&#xD;
yearly hires a drove during the busy season from this&#xD;
side the Mississippi.&#xD;
One of his negro drivers, a pleasant, intelligent&#xD;
boy, was named Augustus. During the holidays, and&#xD;
occasionally while at work in adjoining fields, I had&#xD;
an opportunity of making his acquaintance, which&#xD;
eventually ripened into a warm and mutual attach-&#xD;
ment. Summer before last he was so unfortunate as&#xD;
to incur the displeasure of the overseer, a coarse,&#xD;
heartless brute, who whipped him most cruelly. Au-&#xD;
gustus ran away. Reaching a cane rick on Hawkins'&#xD;
plantation, he secreted himself in the top of it. All&#xD;
Carey's dogs we're put upon his track -some fifteen&#xD;
of them -- and soon scented his footsteps to the hiding&#xD;
place. They surrounded the rick, baying and scratch-&#xD;
ing, but could not reach him. Presently, guided by&#xD;
the clamor of the hounds, the prsuers rode up, when&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC7339-00000126"/>&#xD;
244          TWELvE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
245&#xD;
&#xD;
the overseer, mounting on to the rick, drew him forth.&#xD;
As hW rolled down to the ground the whole pack&#xD;
plunged upon him, and before they could be beaten&#xD;
off, had gnawed and mutilated his body in the most&#xD;
shocking manner, their teeth having penetrated to&#xD;
the bone in an hundred places. He was taken up,&#xD;
tied upon a mule, and carried home. But this was&#xD;
Augustus' last trouble. He lingered until the next&#xD;
day, when death sought the unhappy boy, and kindly&#xD;
relieved him from his agony.&#xD;
It was not unusual for slave women as well as slave&#xD;
men to endeavor to escape. Nelly, Eldret's girl, with&#xD;
whom I lumbered for a time in the "Big Cane&#xD;
Brake," lay concealed in Epps' corn crib three days.&#xD;
At night, when his family were asleep, she would&#xD;
steal into the quarters for food, and return to the crib&#xD;
again. We concluded it would no longer be safe for&#xD;
us to allow her to remain, and accordingly she re&#xD;
traced her steps to her own cabin.&#xD;
But the most remarkable instance of a successful&#xD;
evasion of dogs and hunters  vas the following:&#xD;
Among Carey's girls was one by the name of Celeste.&#xD;
She was nineteen or twenty, and far whiter than her&#xD;
owner, or any of his offspring. It required a close&#xD;
inspection to distinguish in her features the slightest&#xD;
trace of African blood. A stranger would never&#xD;
have dreamed that she was the descendant of slaves.&#xD;
I was sitting in my cabin late at night, playing a low&#xD;
air on my violin, when the door opened carefully, and&#xD;
Celeste stood before me. She was pale and haggard.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ifad an apparition arisen from -the earth, I could not&#xD;
have been more startled.&#xD;
"Who are you ?" I demanded, after gazing at her&#xD;
a moment.&#xD;
"I'ml hungry ; give me some bacon," was her reply.&#xD;
My first impression was that she was some de-&#xD;
ranged young mistress, who, escaping from home, was&#xD;
wandering, she knew not whither, and had been&#xD;
attracted to my cabin by the sound of the violin.&#xD;
The coarse cotton slave dress she wore, however, soon&#xD;
dispelled such a supposition.&#xD;
"What is your name ?" I again interrogated.&#xD;
aMy name is Celeste," she answered. "I belong&#xD;
to Carey, and have been two days among the pal-&#xD;
mettoes. I am sick and can't work, and would rather&#xD;
die in the swamp than be whipped to death by the&#xD;
overseer. Carey's dogs won't follow me. They have&#xD;
tried to set them on. There's a secret between them&#xD;
and Celeste, and they wont mind the. devilish orders&#xD;
of the overseer. Give me some meat-I'm starving."&#xD;
I divided my scanty allowance with her, and while&#xD;
partaking of it, she related how she had managed to&#xD;
escape, and described the place of her concealment.&#xD;
In the edge of the swamp, not half a mile from Epps'&#xD;
house, was a large space, thousands, of acres in&#xD;
extent, thickly 'covered with palmetto. Tall trees,&#xD;
whose long arms interlocked each other, formed a&#xD;
canopy above them, so dense as to exclude the beams&#xD;
of the sun.. It was like twilight always, even in the&#xD;
middle of the brightest day. In the centre of this&#xD;

&#xD;
great space, which nothing but serpents very often&#xD;
explore -a sombre and solitary spot - Celeste had&#xD;
erected a rude hut of dead branches that had fallen&#xD;
to the ground, and covered it with the leaves of the&#xD;
palmetto. This was the abode she had selected.&#xD;
She had no fear of Carey's dogs, any more than I had&#xD;
of Epps'. It is a fact, which I have never been able&#xD;
to explain, that there are those whose tracks the&#xD;
hounds will absolutely refuse to follow. Celeste was&#xD;
one of them.&#xD;
For several nights she came to my cabin for food.&#xD;
On one occasion our dogs barked as she approached,&#xD;
which aroused Epps, and induced him to reconnoitre&#xD;
the premises. He did not discover her, but after that&#xD;
it was not deemed prudent for her to come to the&#xD;
yard. When all was silent I carried provisions to a&#xD;
certain spot agreed. upon, where-she would find them.&#xD;
In this manner Celeste passed the greater part of&#xD;
the summer. She regained her health, and became&#xD;
strong and hearty. At all seasons of the year the&#xD;
howlings of wild animals can be heard at night along&#xD;
the borders of the swamps. Several times they had&#xD;
made her a midnight call, awakening her from slum-&#xD;
ber with a growl. Terrified by such unpleasant salu-&#xD;
tations, she finally concluded to abandon her lonely&#xD;
dwelling; and, accordingly, returning to her master,&#xD;
was scourged, her neck meanwhile being fastened in'&#xD;
the stocks, and sent into the field again.&#xD;
The year before my arrival in the country there&#xD;
was a concerted movement among a number of slaves&#xD;
&#xD;
on Bayou Bceuf, that terminated tragically indeed.&#xD;
It was, I presume, a matter of newspaper notoriety at&#xD;
the time, but all the knowledge I have of it, has been&#xD;
derived from the relation of those living at that period&#xD;
in the immediate vicinity of the excitement. It has&#xD;
become a subject of general and unfailing interest in&#xD;
every slave-hut on the bayou, and will doubtless go&#xD;
down to succeeding generations as their chief tradi-&#xD;
tion. Lew Chdney, with whom I became acquainted&#xD;
- a shrewd, cunning negro, more intelligent than the&#xD;
generality of his race, but unscrupulous and full of&#xD;
treachery-conceived the project of organizing a com-&#xD;
pany sufficiently strong to fight their way against all&#xD;
opposition, to the neighboring territory of Mexico.&#xD;
A remote spot, far within the depths of the swamp,&#xD;
back of Hawkins' plantation, was selected as the ral-&#xD;
lying point. Lew flitted from one plantation to an-&#xD;
other, in the dead of night, preaching a crusade to&#xD;
Mexico, and, like Peter the Hermit, creating a furor&#xD;
of excitement wherever he appeared. At length a&#xD;
large number of runaways were assembled; stolen&#xD;
mules, and corn gathered from the fields, and bacon&#xD;
filched from smoke-houses, had been conveyed into&#xD;
the woods. The expedition was about ready to pro-&#xD;
ceed, when their hiding place was discovered. Lew&#xD;
Cheney, becoming convinced of the ultimate failure&#xD;
of his project, in order to curry favor with his master,&#xD;
and avoid the consequences which he foresaw would&#xD;
follow, deliberately determined to sacrifice all his&#xD;
companions. Departing secretly -from the encamp-&#xD;

THE IDEA OF INSURRECTION.&#xD;

ment, he proclaimed among the planters the number&#xD;
collected in the swamp, and, instead of stating truly&#xD;
the object Jhey had in view, asserted their intention&#xD;
was to emerge from their seclusion the first favorable&#xD;
opportunity, and murder every white person along the&#xD;
bayou.&#xD;
Such an announcement, exaggerated as it passed&#xD;
from mouth to mouth, filled the whole country-with&#xD;
terror. The fugitives were surrounded and taken pris-&#xD;
oners, carried in chains to Alexandria, and hung by&#xD;
the populace. Not only those, but many who were&#xD;
suspected, though entirely innocent, were taken from&#xD;
the field and from the cabin, and without the shadow&#xD;
of process or form of trial, hurried to the scaffold.&#xD;
The planters on Bayou Beuf finally rebelled against&#xD;
such reckless destruction of property, but it was not&#xD;
until a regiment of soldiers had arrived from some&#xD;
fort on the Texan frontier, demolished the gallows,&#xD;
and opened the doors of the Alexandria prison, that&#xD;
the idiscriminate slaughter was stayed. Lew Che-&#xD;
ney escaped, and was even rewarded for his treachery.&#xD;
He is still living, but his name is despised and exe-&#xD;
crated by all his race throughout the parishes of&#xD;
Rapides and Avoyelles.&#xD;
Such an idea as insurrection, however, is not new&#xD;
among the enslaved population of Bayou Bouf. More&#xD;
than once I have joined in serious.consultation, when&#xD;
the subject has been discussed, and there have been&#xD;
times when a word from me. would have placed hun-&#xD;
dreds of my fellow-bondsmen in an attitude of defi-&#xD;
&#xD;
240&#xD;
&#xD;
ance. Without arms or ammunition, or even with&#xD;
them, I saw such a step would result in certain defeat,&#xD;
disaster and death, and always raised my voice&#xD;
against it.&#xD;
During the Mexican war I well remember the ex-&#xD;
travagant hopes that were excited. The news of vic&#xD;
tory filled the great house with rejoicing, but pro-&#xD;
duced only sorrow and disappointment in the cabin.&#xD;
In my opinion - and I have had opportunity to know&#xD;
something of the feeling of which I speak -there are&#xD;
not fifty slaves on the shores of. Bayou Boug but&#xD;
would hail with unmeasured delight the approach of&#xD;
an invading army.&#xD;
They are deceived who flatter themselves that the&#xD;
ignorant and debased slave has no conception of the&#xD;
magnitude of his wrongs. They are deceived who&#xD;
imagine that he arises from his knees, with back la-&#xD;
cerated and bleeding, cherishing only a spirit of meek-&#xD;
ness and forgiveness. A day may come -it will&#xD;
come, if his prayer is heard - a terrible day of ven-&#xD;
geance, when the master in his turn will cry in vain&#xD;
for mercy.&#xD;

WILEY suffered severely at the hands of Master&#xD;
Epps, as has been related in the preceding Chapter,&#xD;
but in this respect he fared nao worse than his unfor-&#xD;
tunate companions. "Spare the rod," was an idea&#xD;
scouted by our master. He was constitutionally sub-&#xD;
ject to periods of ill-humor, and at such times, how-&#xD;
ever little provocation there might. be, a certain&#xD;
amount of punishment was inflicted. The circum-&#xD;
stances attending the last flogging but one that I re-&#xD;
ceived, will show how trivial a cause was sufficient&#xD;
with him for resorting to the whip.&#xD;
A IMr. O'Niel, residing in the vicinity of the Big&#xD;
Pine Woods, called upon Epps for the purpose of pur-&#xD;
&#xD;
chasing me. He was a tanner and currier, by occu-&#xD;
pation, transacting an extensive business, and intend-&#xD;
ed to place me at service in some department of hid&#xD;
establishment, provided he bought me. Aunt Phebe,&#xD;
while preparing the dinner-table in the great house,&#xD;
overheard their conversation. On returning -to the&#xD;
yard at night, the old woman ran to meet me, design-&#xD;
ing, of course, to overwhelm me with the news. She&#xD;
entered into a minute repetition of all she had heard,&#xD;
and Aunt Phebe was one whose ears never failed to&#xD;
drink in every word of conversation uttered in her&#xD;
hearing. She enlarged upon the fact that "iMassa&#xD;
Epps was g'wine to sell me to a tanner ober in de&#xD;
Pine Woods," so long and loudly as to attract the at-&#xD;
tention of the mistress, who, standing unobserved on&#xD;
the piazza at the time, was listening to our conver-&#xD;
sation.&#xD;
"Well, Aunt Phebe," said I, "I'm glad of it. 'm&#xD;
tired of scraping cotton, and would rather be a tanner.&#xD;
I hope he'll buy me."&#xD;
O'Niel did not effect a purchase, however, the par-&#xD;
ties differing as to price, and the morning following&#xD;
his arrival,' departed homewards. He had been gone&#xD;
but a short time, when Epps made his appearance in&#xD;
the field. Now nothing will more violently enrage a&#xD;
master, especially Epps, than the intimation of one of&#xD;
his servants that he would like to leave him. Mis-&#xD;
tress Epps had repeated to him my expressions to&#xD;
Aunt Phdbe the evening previous, as I learned from&#xD;
the latter afterwards, the mistress having mentioned&#xD;

STABBING OF UNCLE ABRAM.&#xD;

&#xD;
to her that she had overheard us. On entering the&#xD;
field, Epps walked directly to me.&#xD;
"9 So, Platt, you're tired of scraping cotton, are you?&#xD;
You would like to change your master, eh ? You're&#xD;
fond of moving round -traveler - ain't ye ? Ah,&#xD;
yes-like to travel for your health, may be? Feel&#xD;
above cotton-scraping, I spouse . So you're going into&#xD;
the tanning business? Good business - devilish fine&#xD;
business. Enterprising nigger! B'lieve I'll go into&#xD;
that business myself. Down on your knees, and strip&#xD;
that rag off your back! I'll try my hand at tanning.".&#xD;
I begged earnestly, and endeavored to soften him&#xD;
with excuses, but in vain. There was no other alter-&#xD;
native ; so kneeling down, I presented my bare back&#xD;
for the application of the lash.&#xD;
" How do you like tanning ?" he exclaimed, as the&#xD;
rawhide descended upon my flesh. "How do you&#xD;
like tannin ?" he repeated at every blow. In this&#xD;
manner he gave me twenty or thirty lashes, inces-&#xD;
santly giving utterance to the word "tanning," in one&#xD;
form of expression or another. When sufficiently&#xD;
"tanned," he, allowed me to arise, and with a half-&#xD;
malicious laugh assured me, if I still fancied the busi-&#xD;
ness, he would give me further instruction in it when.&#xD;
ever I desired. This time, he remarked, he had only&#xD;
given me a short lesson in "tanning "- the next time&#xD;
he would "curry me down."&#xD;
Uncle Abram, also, was frequently treated with&#xD;
great brutality, although he was one of the kindest&#xD;
and most faithful creatures in the world. He was my&#xD;
&#xD;
cabin-mate for years.  There was a benevolent ex-&#xD;
pression in the old man's face, pleasant to behold.&#xD;
He regarded us with a kind of parental feeling, always&#xD;
counseling us with remarkable gravity and delibe-&#xD;
ration.&#xD;
Returning from Marshall's plantation one afternoon,&#xD;
whither I had been sent on some errand of the mis-&#xD;
tress, I found him lying on the cabin floor, his clothes&#xD;
saturated with blood. He informed me that he had&#xD;
been stabbed ! While spreading cotton on the scaf-&#xD;
fold, Epps came home intoxicated from Holmesville.&#xD;
ie found fault with every thing, giving many orders&#xD;
so directly contrary that it was impossible to execute&#xD;
any of them. Uncle Abram, whose faculties were&#xD;
growing dull, became confused, and committed some&#xD;
blunder of no particular consequence. Epps was so&#xD;
enraged thereat, that, with drunken recklessness, he&#xD;
flew upon the old man, and stabbed him in the back.&#xD;
It was a long, ugly wound, but did not happen to&#xD;
penetrate far enough to result fatally. It was sewed&#xD;
up by the mistress, who censured her husband with&#xD;
extreme severity, not only denouncing his inhumanity,&#xD;
but declaring that she expected nothing else than that&#xD;
he would bring the family to poverty  that he would&#xD;
kill all the slaves on the plantation in some of his&#xD;
drunken fits.&#xD;
It was no uncommon thing with him to prostrate&#xD;
Aunt Phebe with a chair or stick of wood; but the&#xD;
most cruel whipping that ever I was doomed to wit-&#xD;
ness - one I can never recall with any other emotion&#xD;

PATSEY'S RETURN FROM SHAW'S.&#xD;
&#xD;
255&#xD;
&#xD;
than that of horror -was inflicted on the unfortunate&#xD;
Patsey.&#xD;
It has been seen that the jealousy and hatred of&#xD;
Mistress Epps made the daily life of her young and&#xD;
agile slave completely miserable. I am happy in the&#xD;
belief that on numerous occasions I was the means of&#xD;
averting punishment from the inoffensive girl. In&#xD;
Epps' absence the mistress often ordered me to whip&#xD;
her without the remotest provocation. I would refuse,&#xD;
saying that I feared my master's displeasure, and sev-&#xD;
eral times ventured to remonstrate with her against&#xD;
the treatment Patsey received. I endeavored to im-&#xD;
press her with the truth that the latter was not re-&#xD;
sponsible for the acts of which she complained, but&#xD;
that she being a slave, and subject entirely to her&#xD;
master's will, he alone was answerable.&#xD;
At length "the green-eyed monster" crept into the&#xD;
soul of Epps also, and then it was that he joined with&#xD;
his wrathful wife in an infernal jubilee over the girl's&#xD;
miseries.&#xD;
On a Sabbath day in hoeing time, not long ago, we&#xD;
were on the bayou bank, washing our clothes, as was&#xD;
our usual custom. Presently Patsey was missing.&#xD;
Epps called aloud, but there was no answer. No one&#xD;
had observed her leaving the yard, and it was a won-&#xD;
der with us whither she had gone. In the course of&#xD;
a couple of hours she was seen approaching from the&#xD;
direction of -Shaw's. This man, as has been intima-&#xD;
ted, was a notorious profligate, and withal not on the&#xD;
most friendly terms with Epps. Harriet, his black&#xD;
&#xD;
wife, knowing Patsey's troubles, was kind her, in&#xD;
consequence of which the latter was in the habit of&#xD;
going over to see her every opportunity. Her visits&#xD;
were prompted by friendship merely, but the suspi-&#xD;
cion gradually entered the brain of Epps, that another&#xD;
and a baser passion led her thither - that it was not&#xD;
Harriet she desired to meet, but rather the unblush-&#xD;
ing libertine, his neighbor. Patsey found her master&#xD;
in a fearful rage on her return. His violence so&#xD;
alarmed her that at first she attempted to evade direct&#xD;
answers to his questions, which only served to increase&#xD;
his suspicions. She finally, however, drew herself up&#xD;
proudly, and in a spirit of indignation boldly denied&#xD;
his charges.&#xD;
a Missus don't give me soap to wash with, as she&#xD;
does the rest," said Patsey, "and you know why. I&#xD;
went over to Harriet's to get a piece," and saying this,&#xD;
she drew it forth from a pocket in her dress and ex-&#xD;
hibited it to him. "That's what I went to Shaw's for,&#xD;
Massa Epps," continued she;- "the Lord knows that&#xD;
was all."&#xD;
"You lie, you black wench !" shouted Epps.&#xD;
"I don't lie, massa. If you kill me, I'll stick to that."&#xD;
"Oh ! I'll fetch you down. I'll learn you to go to&#xD;
Shaw's. I'll take the starch out of ye," he muttered&#xD;
fiercely through his shut teeth.&#xD;
Then turning to me, he ordered four stakes to be&#xD;
driven into the ground, pointing with the toe of his&#xD;
boot to the places where he wanted them. When the&#xD;
takes were driven down, he ordered her to be strip-&#xD;

ped of every article of dress.  Ropes were then&#xD;
brought, and the naked girl was laid upon her face,&#xD;
her wrists and feet each tied firmly to a stake. Step-&#xD;
ping to the piazza, he took down a heavy whip, and                   -&#xD;
placing it in my hands, commanded me to lash her.&#xD;
Unpleasant as it was, I was compelled to obey him.&#xD;
Nowhere that day, on the face of the whole earth, I&#xD;
venture to say, was there such a demoniac exhibition&#xD;
witnessed as then ensued.&#xD;
Mistress Epps stood on the piazza among her chil-&#xD;
dren, gazing on the scene with an air of heartless sat-&#xD;
isfaction. The slaves were huddled together at a lit-&#xD;
tle distance, their countenances indicating the sorrow&#xD;
of their hearts. Poor Patsey prayed piteously for&#xD;
mercy, but her prayers were vain. Epps ground his&#xD;
teeth, and stamped upon the ground, screaming at me,&#xD;
like a mad fiend, to strike harder.&#xD;
"Strike harder, or your turn will come next, you&#xD;
scoundrel," he yelled.&#xD;
" Oh, mercy, massa !-oh! have mercy, do. Oh,&#xD;
God ! pity me," Patsey exclaimed continually, strug-&#xD;
gling fruitlessly, and the flesh quivering at - every&#xD;
stroke.&#xD;
When I had struck her as many as thirty times, I&#xD;
stopped, and turned round toward Epps, hoping he&#xD;
was satisfied; but with bitter oaths and threats; he&#xD;
ordered me to continue. I inflicted ten or fifteen&#xD;
blows more. By this time her back was covered with                     o.    -&#xD;
long welts, intersecting each other' like net work.&#xD;
Epps was yet furious and savage as ever, demanding                THE STAKING OUT END FLOGGING OF THlE GIRL PATSEY.&#xD;

if she would like to go to Shaw's again, and swear-&#xD;
ing he would flog her until she wished she was in h-i.&#xD;
Throwing down the whip, I declared I could punish&#xD;
her no more. He ordered me to go on, threatening&#xD;
me with a severer flogging than she had received, in&#xD;
case of refusal. My heart revolted at the inhuman&#xD;
scene, and risking the consequences, I absolutely re-&#xD;
fused to raise the whip. He then seized it himself,&#xD;
and applied it with ten-fold greater force than I had.&#xD;
The painful cries and shrieks of the tortured Patsey,&#xD;
mingling with the loud and angry curses of Epps,&#xD;
loaded the air. She was terribly lacerated - I may&#xD;
say, without exaggeration, literally flayed. The&#xD;
lash was wet with blood, which flowed down her&#xD;
sides and dropped upon the ground. At length she&#xD;
ceased struggling. Her head sank listlessly on the&#xD;
ground. Her screams and supplications gradually&#xD;
decreased and died away into a low moan. She no&#xD;
longer writhed and shrank beneath the lash when it bit&#xD;
out small pieces of her flesh. I thought that she was&#xD;
dying!&#xD;
It was the Sabbath of the Lord.' The fields smiled&#xD;
in the warm sunlight -the birds chirped merrily&#xD;
amidst the foliage'of the trees -peace and happiness&#xD;
seemed to reign everywhere, save in the bosoms of&#xD;
Epps and his panting victim and the silent witnesses&#xD;
around him. The tempestuous emotions that were&#xD;
raging there were little in harmony with the calm&#xD;
and quiet beauty of the day. I could look on Epps&#xD;
only with unutterable loathing and abhorrence, and&#xD;

thought within myself-" Thou devil, sooner or later,&#xD;
somewhere in the course of eternal justice, thou shalt&#xD;
answer for this sin-!)"&#xD;
Finally, he ceased whipping from mere exhaustion,&#xD;
and ordered Phebe to bring a bucket of salt and wa-&#xD;
ter. After washing her thoroughly with this, I was&#xD;
told to take her to her cabin. Untying the ropes, I&#xD;
raised her in my arms. She was unable to stand, and&#xD;
as her head rested on my shoulder, she repeated ma-&#xD;
ny times, in a faint voice scarcely perceptible, " Oh,&#xD;
Platt-oh, Platt !" but nothing further. Her dress&#xD;
was replaced, but it clung to her back, and was soon&#xD;
stiff with blood. We laid her on some boards in the&#xD;
hut, where she remained a long time, with eyes closed&#xD;
and groaning in agony. At night Phebe applied&#xD;
melted tallow to her wounds, and'so far as we were&#xD;
able, all endeavored to assist and console her. Day&#xD;
after day she lay in her cabin upon her face, the sores&#xD;
preventing her resting in any other position.&#xD;
A blessed thing it would have been for her -days&#xD;
and weeks and months of misery it would have saved&#xD;
her -had she never lifted up her head in life again.&#xD;
Indeed, from that time forward she was not what she&#xD;
had been. The burden of a deep melancholy weigh-.&#xD;
ed heavily on her spirits. She no longer moved with&#xD;
that buoyant and elastic step- there was not that&#xD;
mirthful sparkle in her eyes that formerly distin-&#xD;
guished her. The bounding vigor -the sprightly,&#xD;
laughter-loving spirit of her youth, were gone. She&#xD;
fell into a mournful and desponding mood, and often-&#xD;

PATSEY'S IDEA - OF GOD) &amp;amp;C.&#xD;

&#xD;
times would start up in her sleep, and with raised&#xD;
hands, plead for mercy. She became more silent&#xD;
than she was, toiling all day in our midst, not uttering&#xD;
a word. A care-worn, pitiful expression settled on&#xD;
her face, and it was her humor now to weep, rather&#xD;
than rejoice. If ever there was a broken heart&#xD;
one crushed and blighted by the rude grasp of suffer-&#xD;
ing and misfortune -it was Patsey's.&#xD;
She had been reared no better than her master's&#xD;
beast -looked upon merely as a valuable and hand-&#xD;
some animal-and consequently possessed but a lim-&#xD;
ited amount of knowledge. And yet a faint light&#xD;
cast its rays over her intellect, so that it was not&#xD;
wholly dark. She had a dim perception of God and&#xD;
of eternity, and a still more dim perception of a Sav-&#xD;
iour who had died even for such as her. She enter&#xD;
tained but confused notions of a future life -not com-&#xD;
prehending the distinction between the corporeal and&#xD;
spiritual existence. Happiness, in her mind, was ex-&#xD;
emption from stripes-from labor -from the cruelty&#xD;
of masters and overseers. Her idea of the joy of&#xD;
heaven was simply rest, and is fully expressed in these&#xD;
lines of a melancholy bard:&#xD;
"I ask no paradise on high,&#xD;
With cares on earth oppressed,&#xD;
The only heaven for which I sigh,&#xD;
Is rest, eternal rest."&#xD;
It is a mistaken opinion that prevails in some quar-&#xD;
ters, that the slave does not understand the term-&#xD;
does not comprehend the idea of freedom. Even on&#xD;

TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Bayou Bcuf, where I conceive slavery exists in it;&#xD;
most abject and cruel form- where it exhibits fea.&#xD;
tures altogether unknown in more northern States -&#xD;
the most ignorant of them  generally know full well&#xD;
its meaning. They understand the privileges and&#xD;
exemptions that belong to it -that it would bestow&#xD;
upon them the fruits of their own labors, and that it&#xD;
would secure to them the enjoyment of domestic hap-&#xD;
piness. They do not fail to observe the difference&#xD;
between their own condition and the meanest white&#xD;
man's, and to realize the injustice of the laws which&#xD;
place it in his power not only to appropriate the&#xD;
profits of their industry, but to subject them to un--&#xD;
merited and unprovoked punishment, without reme-&#xD;
dy, or the right to resist, or to remonstrate.&#xD;
Patsey's life, especially after her whipping, was one&#xD;
long dream of liberty. Far away, to her fancy ant&#xD;
immeasurable distance, she knew there was a land of&#xD;
freedom. A thousand times she had heard that&#xD;
somewhere in the distant North there were no&#xD;
slaves -no masters. In her imagination it was an&#xD;
enchanted region, the Paradise of the earth. To dwell&#xD;
where the black man may work for himself-live in&#xD;
his own cabin -till his own soil, was a blissful dream&#xD;
of Patsey's-a dream, alas ! the fulfillment of which&#xD;
she can never realize.&#xD;
The effect of these exhibitions of brutality on the&#xD;
household of the, slave-holder, is apparent. Epps'&#xD;
oldest son is an intelligent lad of ten or twelve years&#xD;
of age. It is pitiable, sometimes, to see him chas-&#xD;
&#xD;
tising, for instance, the venerable Uncle Abram. He&#xD;
will call the old man to account, and if in his child-&#xD;
ish judgment, it is necessary, sentence him to a cer-&#xD;
tain number of lashes, which he proceeds to inflict&#xD;
with much gravity-and deliberation. Mounted on his&#xD;
pony, he often rides into the field with his whip, play-&#xD;
ing the overseer, greatly to his father's delight.&#xD;
Without discrimination, at such times, he applies the&#xD;
rawhide, urging the slaves forward with shouts, and&#xD;
occasional expressions of profanity, while the old man&#xD;
laughs, and commends him as a thorough-going boy.&#xD;
"The, child is father to the man," and with such&#xD;
training, whatever may be his natural disposition, it&#xD;
cannot well be otherwise than that, on arriving at ma-&#xD;
turity, the sufferings and miseries of the slave will&#xD;
be looked upon with entire indifference. The influ-&#xD;
ence of the iniquitous system necessarily fosters an&#xD;
uinfeeling and cruel spirit, even in the bosoms of those&#xD;
who, among their equals, are regarded as humane&#xD;
and generous.&#xD;
Young Master Epps possessed some noble qualities,&#xD;
yet no process of reasoning could lead him to coin-&#xD;
prehend, that in the eye of the Almighty there is no&#xD;
distinction of color. He looked upon the black man&#xD;
simply as an animal, differing in no respect from any&#xD;
other animal, save in the gift of speech and the pos-&#xD;
session of somewhat higher instincts, and, therefore,&#xD;
the more valuable. To work like his father's mules -&#xD;
to be whipped and kicked and scourged through life -&#xD;
to address the white man with bat in hand, and eyes&#xD;

ME-MY FAITH IN HIM.&#xD;
IN the month of June, 1852, in pursuance of a pre&#xD;
vious contract, Mr. Avery, a carpenter of Bayou&#xD;
 Rouge, commenced the erection of a house for Mas-&#xD;
ter Epps.   It has previously been stated that there&#xD;
are no cellars on Bayou Bouf; on the other hand,&#xD;
y    such is the low  and swampy nature of the ground,&#xD;
the great houses are usually built upon spills.    An-&#xD;
other peculiarity is, the rooms are not plastered, but&#xD;
the ceiling and sides are covered with matched cy-&#xD;
press boards, painted such color as most pleases the&#xD;
owner's taste.  Generally the plank and boards are&#xD;
sawed by slaves with whip-saws, there being no water-&#xD;
power upon which mills might be built within many&#xD;
miles. When the planter erects for himself a dwel-&#xD;
ling, therefore, there is plenty of extra work for his&#xD;

slaves. Having had some experience under Tibeats&#xD;
as a carpenter, I was taken from the field altogether,&#xD;
on the arrival of Avery and his hands.&#xD;
Among them was one to whom I owe an immeas-&#xD;
urable debt of gratitude. Only for him, in all prob-&#xD;
ability, I should have ended my days in slavery. ie&#xD;
was my deliverer - a man whose true heart over-&#xD;
flowed with noble and generous emotions. To the&#xD;
last moment of my existence I shall remember him&#xD;
with feelings of thankfulness. His name was Bass,&#xD;
and at that time he resided in Marksville. It will&#xD;
be difficult to convey a correct impression of his ap-&#xD;
pearance or character. He was a large man, between&#xD;
forty and fifty years old, of light complexion and&#xD;
light hair. He was very cool and self-possessed, fond&#xD;
of argument, but always speaking with extreme de-&#xD;
liberation. He was that kind of person whose pecu-&#xD;
liarity of manner was such that nothing he uttered&#xD;
ever gave offence. What would be intolerable, com..&#xD;
ing from the lips of another, could be said by him&#xD;
with impunity. There was not a man on lRed River,&#xD;
perhaps, that agreed with him on the subject of poli-&#xD;
tics or religion, and not a man, I venture to say, who&#xD;
discussed either of those subjects half as. much. It&#xD;
seemed to be taken for granted that he would espouse&#xD;
the unpopular side of every local question, and it al-&#xD;
ways created amusement rather than displeasure&#xD;
among his auditors, to listen to the ingenious and&#xD;
original manner in which he maintained the contro-&#xD;
versy. He was a bachelor - an ":old bachelor," ac-&#xD;
&#xD;
BAssI THE CARPENTER.265&#xD;
cording to the true acceptation of the term---having&#xD;
no kindred living, as he knew of, in the world. Nei-&#xD;
tlier had he any permanent abiding place--- wander-&#xD;
ing from one State to another, as his fancy dictated.&#xD;
He had lived in Marksville three or four years, and&#xD;
in the prosecution of his business as a carpenter; 'and&#xD;
in consequence, likewise, of his peculiarities, was&#xD;
quite extensively known throughout the parish of&#xD;
Avoyelles. He was liberal to a fault; and his many&#xD;
acts of kindness and transparent goodness of heart&#xD;
rendered him popular in the community, the senti-&#xD;
ment of which he unceasingly combated.&#xD;
Ie was a native of Canada, from whence he had&#xD;
wandered in early life, and after visiting all the prin-&#xD;
cipal'localities in the northern and western States, in&#xD;
the course of his peregrinations, arrived in the un-&#xD;
healthy region of the -Red River. His last removal&#xD;
was from Illinois. Whither he has now gone, I re-&#xD;
gret to be obliged to. say, i unknown: to me. He&#xD;
gathered up his effects and departed quietly from&#xD;
Marksville the day before I did, the suspicions of his&#xD;
instrumentality in procuring my liberation rendering&#xD;
such a step necessary. For the commission of a just&#xD;
and righteous act he would undoubtedly have suffer-&#xD;
ed death, had he remained within reach of the slave-&#xD;
whipping tribe on Byou Bouf.&#xD;
One day, while working on the new house, Bass&#xD;
and Epps became engaged in a controversy, to which,&#xD;
as will be readily supposed, I listened with absorbing&#xD;
interest. They were discussing the subject of Slavery.&#xD;

266          TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
"I tell you what it is Epps," said Bass, "it's all&#xD;
wrong- all wrong, sir -there's no justice nor right-&#xD;
eousness in it. I wouldn't own a slave if I was rich&#xD;
as Crosus, which I am not, as is perfectly well under-&#xD;
stood, more particularly among my creditors. iere's&#xD;
another humbug - the credit system --humbug, sir ;&#xD;
no credit - no debt. Credit leads a man into tempta-&#xD;
tion. Cash down is the only thing that will deliver&#xD;
him from evil. But this question -of Slavery; what&#xD;
right have you to your niggers when you come down&#xD;
to the point?"&#xD;
"What right !" said Epps, laughing; " why, I&#xD;
bought 'em, and paid for 'em."&#xD;
Of course you did ; the law says you have the right&#xD;
to hold a nigger, but begging the law's pardon, it&#xD;
lies. Yes, Epps, when the law says that it's a liar,&#xD;
and the truth is not in it. Is every thing right be-&#xD;
cause the law allows it? Suppose they'd pass a law&#xD;
taking away your liberty and making you a slave ?"&#xD;
"4Oh, that ain't a supposable case," said Epps, still&#xD;
laughing; "hope you don't compare me to a nigger,&#xD;
Bass."&#xD;
"4Well," Bass answered gravely, "no, not exactly.&#xD;
But I have seen niggers before now as good as I am,&#xD;
and Ihave no acquaintance with any white man in&#xD;
these parts that I consider a whit better than myself.&#xD;
Now, in the sight of God, what is the difference,&#xD;
Epps, between a white man and a black one?",&#xD;
" All the difference in the world," replied Epps.&#xD;
"cYou .Light as well ask what the difference is be-&#xD;

laugh at his own wit.&#xD;
"Look here, Epps," continued his companion ; "you&#xD;
can't laugh me down in that way. Some men are&#xD;
witty, and some ain't so witty as they think they are.&#xD;
Now let me ask you a question. Are all men created&#xD;
free and equal as the Declaration of Independence&#xD;
holds they are?"&#xD;
" Yes," responded Epps, " but all men, niggers, and&#xD;
monkeys ain't;" and hereupon he 'broke forth into a&#xD;
more boisterous laugh than before.&#xD;
" There are monkeys among white people as well&#xD;
as black, when you come to that," coolly remarked,&#xD;
Bass. "I know some white men that use arguments&#xD;
no sensible monkey would. But let that pass. These&#xD;
niggers are human beings. ' If they don't know as&#xD;
much as their masters, whose fault is it ? They are&#xD;
not allowed to know anything. You have books and&#xD;
papers, and. can go where you please, and gather&#xD;
intelligence in a thousand ways. But your slaves&#xD;
have no privileges. You'd whip one of them if&#xD;
caught reading a book. They are held in bondage,&#xD;
generation after generation, deprived of mental im-&#xD;
provement, and who can expect them to possess much&#xD;
knowledge ? If they are not brought down to a level&#xD;
with the brute creation, you slaveholders will never&#xD;
be blamed for it. If they ae baboons, or stand no&#xD;

CONVERSATION WITH BASS.         269&#xD;
&#xD;
higher in the scale of intelligence than such animals,&#xD;
you and men like you will have to answer for.it.&#xD;
There's a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this nation, that&#xD;
will not go unpunished forever. There will be a&#xD;
reckoning yet -yes, Epps, there's a day coming that&#xD;
will burn as an oven. It may be sooner or it may be&#xD;
later, but it's a coming as sure as the Lord is just."&#xD;
"If you lived up among the Yankees in New.&#xD;
England," said Epps, "I expect you'd be one of them&#xD;
cursed fanatics that know more than the constitution,&#xD;
and go about peddling clocks and coaxing niggers&#xD;
to run away."&#xD;
"If I was in New-England," returned Bass, "I&#xD;
would be just what I am here. I would say that&#xD;
Slavery was an iniquity, and ought to be abolished.&#xD;
I would say there was no reason nor justice in the&#xD;
law, or the constitution that allows one man to hold&#xD;
another man in bondage. It would be hard for you&#xD;
to lose your property, to be sure, but it wouleln't be&#xD;
half as hard as it would be to lose your liberty. You&#xD;
have no more right to your freedom, in exact justice,&#xD;
than Uncle Abram yonder. Talk about black skin,&#xD;
and black-blood; why, how many slaves are there on&#xD;
this bayou as white as either of us? And what dif-&#xD;
ference is there in the color of the soul? Pshaw ! the&#xD;
whole system is as absurd as it is cruel. You may&#xD;
own niggers and behanged, but I wouldn't own one&#xD;
for the best plantation in Louisiana."&#xD;
"You like to hear yourself talk, Bass, better than&#xD;
any man l1know of. You would argue that black was&#xD;
&#xD;
white, or white black, if any body would contradict&#xD;
you. Nothing suits you in this world, and I don't&#xD;
believe you will be satisfied with the next, if you&#xD;
should have your choice in them."&#xD;
Conversations substantially like the foregoing were&#xD;
not unusual between the two after this; Epps drawing&#xD;
him out more for the purpose of creating a laugh at&#xD;
Jo     his expense, than with a view of fairly discussing the&#xD;
merits of the question. He looked upon Bass, as a&#xD;
man ready to say anything merely for the pleasure of&#xD;
hearing Iis own voice; as somewhat self-conceited,&#xD;
perhaps, contending against his faith and judgment,&#xD;
in order, simply, to exhibit his dexterity in Argumen-&#xD;
tation.&#xD;
He remained at Epps' through the summer, Visiting&#xD;
Marksville generally once a fortnight. The more I&#xD;
saw of him, the more I became convinced he was a&#xD;
man in whom I could confide. Nevertheless, my&#xD;
previous ill-fortune had taught me to be extremely&#xD;
cautious. It was not my place to speak to a white'&#xD;
man except when spoken to, but I omitted no oppor-&#xD;
tunity of throwing myself in his way and endeavored&#xD;
constantly in every possible manner to attract his&#xD;
attention. In the early part of August he and my-&#xD;
self were at work alone in the house, the other car-&#xD;
penters having left and Epps being absent in the&#xD;
field. Now was the time, if ever, to broach the sub-&#xD;
ject, and I resolved to do it, and submit to whatever&#xD;
consequences might ensue. We were busily at work&#xD;
in the afternoon, when I stopped suddenly and said --&#xD;

"Master Bass, I want to ask you what part of the&#xD;
country you came from ?"&#xD;
"Why, Platt, what put that into your head?" he&#xD;
answered. "You wouldn't know if I should tell you."&#xD;
After a moment or two he added-" I was born in&#xD;
Canada; now guess where that is."&#xD;
"Oh, I know where Canada is," said I, "I have.&#xD;
been there myself."&#xD;
" Yes, I expect you are well acquainted all through&#xD;
that country," he remarked, laughing incredulously.&#xD;
"As sure as.I live, Master Bass," I replied,."Ihave&#xD;
been there. I have been in Montreal and Kingston,&#xD;
and Queenston, and a great many places in Canada,&#xD;
and I have been in York State, too -in BufThlo, and&#xD;
Rochester, and Albany, and can tell you the names&#xD;
of the villages on the Erie canal and the Champlain&#xD;
canal."&#xD;
Bass turned round and gazed at me a long time&#xD;
without uttering a syllable.&#xD;
" How came you here?" he inquired, at length,&#xD;
"Master Bass," I answered, "if justice had been&#xD;
done, I never would have been here."&#xD;
" Well, how's this? " said he. "Who are you? You&#xD;
have been in Canada sure enough; I know- all the&#xD;
places you mention. How did you happen to'get&#xD;
here? Come, tell me all about it."&#xD;
"I have no friends here," was my ;reply, "that I&#xD;
can put confidence in. I am afraid to tell you,&#xD;

I should."&#xD;

lie assured me earnestly he would keep every word&#xD;
I might speak to him a profound secret, and his curi-&#xD;
osity was evidently strongly excited. It was a long&#xD;
story; I informed him, and would take some time to&#xD;
relate it. Master Epps would be back soon, but, if he&#xD;
would see me that night after all were asleep, I would&#xD;
repeat it to him. He consented readily to the ar-&#xD;
rangement, and directed me to come into the building&#xD;
where we were then at work, and I would find. him&#xD;
there. About midnight, when all was still and quiet,&#xD;
I crept cautiously from my cabin, and silently enter-&#xD;
ing the unfinished building, found him awaiting me.&#xD;
After further assurances on his part that I should&#xD;
not be betrayed, I began a relation of the history of&#xD;
my life and misfortunes. He was deeply interested,&#xD;
asking numerous questions in reference to localities&#xD;
and events. Having ended my story I besought him&#xD;
to write to some of my friends at the North, acquaint-&#xD;
ing them with my situation, and begging themto for-&#xD;
ward free papers, or take such steps as they might&#xD;
consider proper to secure my release. He promised&#xD;
to 'do so, but dwelt upon the danger of such an act in&#xD;
case of detection, and now .impressed upon me the'&#xD;
great necessity of strict silence and secresy. Before&#xD;
we parted our plan of operation was arranged.&#xD;
We agreed to meet the next night at a specified&#xD;
place among the high weeds on the bank of the bayou,&#xD;
some distance from master's dwelling. There he was&#xD;
to write down on paper the names and address of sev-&#xD;
eral persons, old friends in the North, to whom he&#xD;

&#xD;
would direct letters during his next visit to Marks-&#xD;
ville. It was not deemed prudent to meet in the new&#xD;
house, inasmuch as the light it would be necessary to&#xD;
use might possibly be discovered. In the course of&#xD;
the day I managed to obtain a few matches and a&#xD;
piece of candle, unperceived, from the kitchen, during&#xD;
a temporary absence of Aunt Phebe. Bass had pen-&#xD;
cil and paper in his tool chest.&#xD;
At the appointed hour we met on the bayou bank,&#xD;
and creeping among the high weeds, I lighted the&#xD;
candle, while he drew forth pencil and paper and pre-&#xD;
pared for business. I gave him the names of Wil-&#xD;
liam Perry, Cephas Parker and Judge Marvin, all of&#xD;
Saratoga Springs, Saratoga county, New-York. I had&#xD;
been employed by the latter in the United States&#xD;
Hotel, and had transacted business with the former to&#xD;
a considerable extent, and trusted that at least one of&#xD;
- them would be still living at that place. le care-&#xD;
fully wrote the names, and then remarked, thought-&#xD;
fully -&#xD;
"It is so many years since you left Saratoga, all&#xD;
these men may be dead, or may have removed. You&#xD;
say you obtained papers at the custom house in New-&#xD;
York. Probably there is a record of them there, and&#xD;
I think it would be well to write and ascertain."&#xD;
I agreed with him, and again repeated the circum&#xD;
stances related heretofore, connected with my visit t-&#xD;
the custom house with Brown and Hamilton. We&#xD;
lingered on the bank of the bayou an hour or more,&#xD;
conversing upon the subject which now engrossed our&#xD;
&#xD;
s&#xD;
a;&#xD;
,a&#xD;
&#xD;
thoughts. I could no longer doubt his fidelity, and&#xD;
freely spoke to him of the many sorrows I had borne&#xD;
in silence, and so long. I spoke of my wife and chil-&#xD;
dren, mentioning their names and ages, and dwelling&#xD;
upon the unspeakable happiness it would be to clasp&#xD;
them to my heart once more before I died. I caught&#xD;
him by the hand, and with tears and passionate en-&#xD;
treaties implored him to befriend me -to restore me&#xD;
to my kindred and to liberty-promising I would weary&#xD;
Heaven the remainder of my life with prayers that it&#xD;
would bless and prosper him. In the enjoyment of&#xD;
freedom-surrounded by the associations of youth,&#xD;
and restored to.the bosom of my family -- that prom-&#xD;
ise is not yet forgotten, not shall it ever be so long as&#xD;
I have strength to raise my imploring eyes on high.&#xD;
"Oh, blessings on his kindly voice and on his silver hair,&#xD;
And blessings on his whole life long, until he meet me there."&#xD;
IIe overwhelmed me with assurances of friendship&#xD;
and faithfulness, saying he had never before taken so&#xD;
deep an interest in the fate of any one. He spoke of&#xD;
himself in a somewhat mournful tone, as a lonely&#xD;
man, a wanderer about the world -that he. was&#xD;
growing old, and must soon reach the end of his&#xD;
earthly journey, and lie down to his final rest with-&#xD;
out kith or kin to mourn for him, or to remember&#xD;
him -that his life was of little value to himself, and&#xD;
henceforth should be devoted' to the accomplishment&#xD;
of my liberty, and to an unceasing warfare against&#xD;
the accursed shame of Slavery.&#xD;

LETTER TO PERRY AND PARKER.      275&#xD;
&#xD;
After this time we seldom spoke to, or recognized&#xD;
each other. He was, moreover, less free in his con-&#xD;
versation with Epps on the subject of Slavery. The&#xD;
remotest suspicion that there was any unusual intima-&#xD;
cy - any secret understanding between us --never&#xD;
once entered the mind of Epps, or any other person,&#xD;
white or black, on the plantation.&#xD;
I am often asked, with an air of incredulity, how I&#xD;
succeeded so many years in keeping from my daily&#xD;
and constant companions the knowledge of my true&#xD;
name and history. The terrible lesson Burch taught&#xD;
me, impressed indelibly upon my mind the danger&#xD;
and uselessness of asserting I was a freeman. .There&#xD;
was no possibility of any slave being able to assist&#xD;
me, while, on the other hand, there was a possibility&#xD;
of his exposing me. When it is recollected the whole&#xD;
current of my thoughts, for twelve years, turned to the&#xD;
contemplation of escape, it will not be wondered at,&#xD;
that I was always cautious and on my guard. It&#xD;
would have been an act of folly to have proclaimed&#xD;
my right to freedom; it would only have subjected&#xD;
me to severer scrutiny- probably have consigned me'&#xD;
to some more distant and inaccessible region than&#xD;
even Bayou Bceuf. Edwin Epps was a person utter-&#xD;
ly regardless of a black man's rights or wrongs = ut-&#xD;
terly destitute of any natural sense of justice, as I&#xD;
well knew. It was important, therefore; not only as&#xD;
regarded my hope of deliverance, but also as regard-&#xD;
ed the few personal priviliges I was permitted to en-&#xD;
joy, to keep from him the history of my life.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Saturday night subsequent to our interview at&#xD;
the water's edge, Bass went home to Marksville. The&#xD;
next day, being Sunday, he employed himself in his&#xD;
own room writing letters. One he directed to the&#xD;
Collector of Customs at New-York, another to Judge&#xD;
Marvin, and another to Messrs. Parker and Perry joint-&#xD;
ly. The latter was the one which led to my recovery.&#xD;
He subscribed my true name, but in the postscript in-&#xD;
timated I was not the writer. The letter itself shows&#xD;
that he considered himself engaged in a dangerous&#xD;
undertaking -no less than running "the risk of his&#xD;
life, if detected." I did not see the letter before it was&#xD;
mailed, but have since obtained a copy, which is here&#xD;
inserted:&#xD;
"Bayou Bouf, Angust 15, 1852.&#xD;

postscript more than to the body of the communica-.&#xD;
tion am I indebted for my liberation, as will present-&#xD;
ly be seen.&#xD;
When Bass returned from Marksville he informed&#xD;
me of what he had done. We continued our mid-&#xD;
night consultations, never speaking to each other&#xD;
through the day, excepting as it was necessary about&#xD;
the work. As nearly as he was able to ascertain, it&#xD;
would require two weeks for the letter to reach Sara-&#xD;
toga in due course of mail, and the same length of&#xD;
time for an answer to return. Within six weeks, at&#xD;
the farthest, we concluded, an answer would arrive, if&#xD;
it arrived at all. A great many suggestions were&#xD;
now made, and a great deal of conversation took place&#xD;
between us, as to the most safe and proper course to&#xD;
pursue on receipt of the free papers. They would&#xD;
stand between him and harm, in case we were over-&#xD;
taken and arrested leaving the country altogether. It&#xD;
would be no infringement of law, however much it&#xD;
might provoke individual hostility, to assist a freeman&#xD;
to regain his freedom.&#xD;
At the end of four weeks lie was again at Marks-&#xD;
ville, but no answer had arrived. I was sorely disap-&#xD;
pointed, but still reconciled myself with the reflection&#xD;
&#xD;
that sufficient length of time had not yet elapsed&#xD;
that there might have been delays - and that I could&#xD;
not reasonably expect one so soon. Six, seven, eight,&#xD;
and ten weeks passed by, however, and nothing came.&#xD;
I was in ha fever of suspense whenever Bass visited&#xD;
Marksville, and could scarcely close my eyes until his&#xD;
return. Finally my master's house was finished, and&#xD;
the time came when Bass must leave me. The night&#xD;
before his departure I was wholly given up to despair.&#xD;
I had clung to him as a drowning man clings to the&#xD;
floating spar, knowing if it slips from his grasp he&#xD;
must forever sink beneath the waves. The all-glorious&#xD;
hope, upon .which I had laid such eager hold, was&#xD;
crumbling to ashes in my hands. I felt as if sinking&#xD;
 down, down, amidst the bitter waters of Slavery, from&#xD;
the unfathomable depths of which I should never&#xD;
rise again.&#xD;
The generous heart of my friend and benefactor was&#xD;
touched with pity at the sight of my distress. He en-&#xD;
deavored to cheer me up, promising to return the day&#xD;
before Christmas, and if no intelligence was received&#xD;
in the meantime, some further step would be under-&#xD;
taken to effect our design. He -exhorted inc to keep&#xD;
up my spirits -to rely upon his continued efforts in&#xD;
my behalf, assuring 1pe, in most earnest and impres-&#xD;
sive language, that my liberation should, from thence-&#xD;
forth, be the chief object of his thoughts..&#xD;
In his absence the time passed slowly indeed. I&#xD;
looked forward to Christmas with intense anxiety and&#xD;
impatience. I had about given up the expectation of&#xD;

receiving any answer to the letters. They might have&#xD;
miscarried, or might have been misdirected. Perhaps&#xD;
those at Saratoga, to whom they had been addressed,&#xD;
were all dead ; perhaps, engaged in their pursuits,&#xD;
they did not consider the fate of an obscure, unhappy&#xD;
black man of sufficient importance to be noticed. My&#xD;
whole reliance was in Bass. The faith I had in him&#xD;
was continually re-assuring me, and enabled me to&#xD;
stand up against the tide of disappointment that had&#xD;
overwhelmed me.&#xD;
So wholly was I absorbed in reflecting upon my sit-&#xD;
uation and prospects, that the hands with whom I la-&#xD;
bored in the field often observed it. Patsey would&#xD;
ask me if I was sick, and Uncle Abram, and Bob, and&#xD;
Wiley frequently expressed a curiosity to know what&#xD;
I could be thinking about so steadily. But Ievaded&#xD;
their inquiries with some light remark, and kept my&#xD;
thoughts locked closely in my breast.&#xD;

FAITUL to his word, the day before Christmas, just&#xD;
at night-fall, Bass cane riding into the yard.&#xD;
"How     are you," said Epps, shaking him         by the&#xD;
hand, "glad to see you."&#xD;
He would not have been very glad had he known&#xD;
the object of his errand.&#xD;
" Quite well, quite well," answered Bass. "Had&#xD;
some business out on the bayou, and concluded to call&#xD;
and see you, and stay over night."&#xD;
Epps ordered one of the slaves to take charge of&#xD;
his horse, and with much talk and laughter they pass-&#xD;
ed into the house together ; not, however, until Bass&#xD;
had looked at me significantly, as much as to say,&#xD;

&#xD;
"Keep dark, we understand each other." It was ten&#xD;
o'clock at night before the labors of the day were per-&#xD;
formed, when I entered the cabin. At that time Un-&#xD;
cle Abram and Bob occupied it with me. I laid&#xD;
down upon my board and feigned I was asleep.&#xD;
When my companions had fallen into a profound&#xD;
slumber, I moved stealthily out of the door, and watch-&#xD;
ed, and listened attentively for some sign or sound&#xD;
from Bass. There I stood until long after midnight,&#xD;
but nothing could be seen or heard. As I suspected,&#xD;
he dared not leave the house, through fear of exciting&#xD;
the suspicion of some of the family. I judged, correct-&#xD;
y, he would rise earlier than was his custom, and&#xD;
take the opportunity of seeing me before Epps was&#xD;
up. Accordingly. I aroused Uncle Abram an hour&#xD;
sooner than usual, and sent him into the house to build&#xD;
a fire, which, at that season of the year, is a part of&#xD;
Uncle Abram's duties.&#xD;
I also gave Bob a violent shake, and asked him if&#xD;
he intended to sleep till noon, saying master would be&#xD;
up before the mules were fed. He knew right well&#xD;
the consequence that would follow such an event, and,&#xD;
jumping to his feet, was at the horse-pasture in a&#xD;
twinkling.&#xD;
Presently, when both were gone, Bass lipped into&#xD;
the cabin.&#xD;
"No letter yet, Platt," said he. The announee-&#xD;
ment fell upon my heart like lead.&#xD;
" Oh, do write again, Master Bass," I cried ; "I&#xD;
will give' you the names of a great many I know.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MEETING IN THE CABIN.       281&#xD;
Surely they are not all dead. Surely some one will&#xD;
pity me."&#xD;
" No use," Bass replied, "no use. Ihave made up&#xD;
my mind to that. I fear the 'Marksville post-master&#xD;
will mistrust something, I have inquired so often at&#xD;
his office. Too uncertain -too dangerous."&#xD;
1' Then it is all over," I exclaimed. "Oh, my God,&#xD;
how can I end my days here !"&#xD;
." You're not going to end them here," he said, "un-&#xD;
less you die very soon. I've thought this matter all&#xD;
over, and have come to a determination. There are&#xD;
more ways than one to manage this business, and a&#xD;
better and surer way than writing letters. I have a&#xD;
job or two on hand which can be completed by March&#xD;
or April. By that time I shall have a considerable&#xD;
sum of money, and then, Platt, I am going to Sarato-&#xD;
ga myself."&#xD;
I could scarcely credit my own senses as the words&#xD;
fell from his lips. But he assured me, in a manner&#xD;
that left no doubt of the sincerity of his intention; that&#xD;
if his life was spared until spring, he should certainly&#xD;
undertake the journey.&#xD;
"I have lived in this region long enough," he con-&#xD;
tinued; "I may as well be in one place as another.&#xD;
For a long time I have been thinking of going back&#xD;
once more to the place where I was born. I'm tired&#xD;
of Slavery as well as you. If I can succeed in getting&#xD;
you away from here, it will be a good act that I shall&#xD;
like to think of all my life. And I shall succeed,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

&#xD;
TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Platt; I'm bound to do it. Now let me tell you what&#xD;
I want. Epps will be up soon, and it won't do to be&#xD;
caught here. Think of a great many men at Sarato-&#xD;
ga and Sandy Hill, and in that neighborhood, who&#xD;
once knew you. I shall make excuse to come here&#xD;
again in the course of the winter, when I will write&#xD;
down their names. I will then know who to call on&#xD;
when I go north. Think of all you can. Cheer up!&#xD;
Don't be discouraged. I'm with you, life or death.&#xD;
Good-bye. God bless you," and saying this he left&#xD;
the cabin quickly, and entered the great house.&#xD;
It was Christmas morning--the happiest day in the&#xD;
whole year for the slave. That morning he need not&#xD;
hurry to the field, with his gourd and cotton-bag.&#xD;
Happiness sparkled in the eyes and overspread the&#xD;
countenances of all. The time of feasting and dancing&#xD;
had come. The cane and cotton'fields were deserted.&#xD;
That day the clean dress was to be donned- the red&#xD;
ribbon displayed; there were to be re-unions, and&#xD;
joy and laughter, and hurrying to and fro. It was&#xD;
to be a day of liberty among the children of Slavery.&#xD;
Wherefore they were happy, and rejoiced.&#xD;
After breakfast Epps and Bass sauntered about the&#xD;
yard, conversing upon the price of cotton, and va-&#xD;
rious other topics.&#xD;
"Where do your niggers hold Christmas ?" Bass in-&#xD;
quired.&#xD;
"Platt is going to Tanners to-day. His fiddle is&#xD;
in greatdemand. They want him at Marshall's Mon-&#xD;

&#xD;
day, and Miss Mary McCoy, on the old Norwood&#xD;
plantation, writes me a note that she wants him to&#xD;
play for her niggers Tuesday."&#xD;
"le is rather a smart boy, -ain't he ?" said Bass.&#xD;
"Come here, Platt," he added, looking at me as I&#xD;
walked up to them, as if he had never thought before&#xD;
to take any special notice of me.&#xD;
"Yes," replied Epps, taking hold of my arm and&#xD;
feeling it, "there isn't a bad joint in him. There ain't&#xD;
a boy on the bayou worth more than he is - perfect-&#xD;
ly sound, and no bad tricks. D-n him, he isn't like&#xD;
other niggers ; doesn't look like 'em -don't act like&#xD;
'em. I was offered seventeen hundred dollars for him&#xD;
last week."&#xD;
"And didn't take it ?" Bass inquired, with an air&#xD;
of surprise.&#xD;
"Take it-no; devilish clear of it. Why, he's a&#xD;
reg'lar genius; can make a plough beam, wagon&#xD;
tongue - anything, as well as you can. Marshall&#xD;
wanted to put up one of his niggers agin him and raf-&#xD;
fle for them, but I told him I would see the devil have&#xD;
him first."&#xD;
"I don't see anything remarkable about him," Bass&#xD;
observed.&#xD;
"'Why, just feel of- him, now," Epps rejoined.&#xD;
"You don't see a boy very often put together any&#xD;
closer than he is. He's a thin-skin'd cuss, and won't&#xD;
bear as much whipping as some; but he's got the&#xD;
muscle in him, and no mistake.&#xD;
Bass felt of me, turned me round, and made a&#xD;

&#xD;
thorough exnination, Epps all the while dwelling on&#xD;
my good points. But his visitor seemed to take but&#xD;
little interest finally in the subject, and consequently&#xD;
it was dropped. Bass soon departed, giving mne an-&#xD;
other sly look of recognition and significance, as lie&#xD;
trotted out of the yard.&#xD;
When he was gone I obtained a pass, and started&#xD;
for Tanner's -not Peter Tanner's, of whom mention&#xD;
has previously been made, but a relative of his.. I&#xD;
played during the day and most of the night, spend-&#xD;
ing the next day, Sunday, in my cabin. Monday I&#xD;
crossed the bayou to Douglas Marshall's, all Epps'&#xD;
slaves accompanying me, and on Tuesday went to the&#xD;
old Norwood place, which is the third plantation&#xD;
above Marshall's, on the same side of the water.&#xD;
This estate is now owned by Miss Mary McCoy, a&#xD;
lovely girl, some twenty years of age. She is the beau-&#xD;
ty and the glory of Bayou Bouf. She owns about a&#xD;
hundred working hands, besides a great many house&#xD;
servants, yard boys, and young.children. Her broth-&#xD;
er-in-law, who resides on the adjoining estate, is her&#xD;
general agent. She is beloved by all her slaves, and&#xD;
good reason indeed have they to be thankful that they'&#xD;
have fallen into such gentle hands. Nowhere on the&#xD;
bayou are there such feasts, such merrymaking, as at&#xD;
young Madam McCoy's. Thither, more than to any&#xD;
other place, do the old and the young for miles around&#xD;
love to repair in the time of the Ch'istmas holidays;&#xD;
for nowhere else can they find such delicious repasts;&#xD;
nowhere else can they hear a voice speaking to them&#xD;
&#xD;
so pleasantly. No one is so well beloved -no one&#xD;
fills so large a space in the hearts of a thousand, slaves,&#xD;
as young Madam McCoy, the orphan mistress of the&#xD;
old Norwood estate.&#xD;
On my arrival at her place, I found two or three&#xD;
hundred had assembled. The table was prepared in&#xD;
a long building, which she had erected expressly for&#xD;
her slaves to dance in. It was covered with every&#xD;
variety of food the country 'afforded, and was pro-&#xD;
nounced by general acclamation to be the rarest of&#xD;
dinners. Roast turkey, pig, chicken, duck, and 'all&#xD;
kinds of meat, baked, boiled, and broiled, formed a&#xD;
line the whole length of the extended table, while the&#xD;
vacant spaces were filled with tarts, jellies, and frost-&#xD;
ed cake, and pastry of many kinds. The young mis-&#xD;
tress walked around the table, smiling and saying a&#xD;
kind word to each one, and seemed to enjoy the scene&#xD;
exceedingly&#xD;
When the dinner was over the tables were remov-&#xD;
ed to make room for the dancers. I tuned my violin&#xD;
and struck up a lively air ; while some joined in a&#xD;
nimble reel, others patted and sang their simple but&#xD;
melodious songs, filling the great room with music&#xD;
mingled with the sound of human.voices and the clat-&#xD;
ter of many feet.&#xD;
In the evening the mistress returned, and stood in&#xD;
the door a long time, looking at us. She was magnifi-&#xD;
cently arrayed. Her dark hair and eyes contrasted.&#xD;
strongly with her clear and delicate complexion.&#xD;
Her form was slender but commanding, and her&#xD;

&#xD;
movement was a combination of unaffected dig'ty&#xD;
and grace. As she stood there, clad in her rich ap-&#xD;
parel, her face animated with pleasure, I thought I had&#xD;
never looked upon a human being half so beautiful.&#xD;
I dwell with delight upon the description of this fair&#xD;
and gentle lady, not only because she inspired me&#xD;
with emotions of gratitude and admiration, but be-&#xD;
cause I would have the reader .understand that all&#xD;
slave-owners on Bayou Bouf are not like Epps, or&#xD;
Tibeats, or Jim Burns. Occasionally can, be found,&#xD;
rarely it may he, indeed, a good man like William&#xD;
Ford, or an angel of kindness like young Mistress&#xD;
McCoy.&#xD;
Tuesday concluded the three holidays Epps yearly&#xD;
allowed us. On my way home, Wednesday morning,&#xD;
while passing the plantation of William Pierce, that&#xD;
gentleman hailed me, saying he had received a line&#xD;
from Epps, brought down by William VXarnell, pe-&#xD;
mitting him to detain me for the purpose of playing&#xD;
for his slaves that night. It was the last time I was&#xD;
destined to witness a slave dance on the shores of Ba-&#xD;
you Beuf. The party at Pierce's continued their jol-&#xD;
liflcation until broad daylight, when I returned to my&#xD;
master's house, somewhat wearied with the loss of&#xD;
rest, but rejoicing in the possession of numerous bits&#xD;
and picayunes, which the whites, who were pleased&#xD;
with my musical performances, had contributed.&#xD;
On Saturday morning, for the first time in years, I&#xD;
overslept ,myself. I was frightened on coining out of&#xD;
the cabin to find the slaves were already in the field.&#xD;
&#xD;
They had preceded me some fifteen minutes. Leav-&#xD;
ing my dinner and water-gourd, I hurried after them&#xD;
as fast as I could - move. It was not yet sunrise, but&#xD;
Epps was on the piazza as I left the hut, and cried out&#xD;
to me that it was a pretty time of day to be getting&#xD;
up, By extra exertion my row was up when hetame&#xD;
out after breakfast. This, however, was no ex use for&#xD;
the offence of oversleeping. Bidding me strip and lie&#xD;
down, he gave me ten or fifteen lashes, at the conclu-&#xD;
sion of which he inquired if I thought, after that, I&#xD;
could get up sometime in the morning. I expressed&#xD;
myself quite positively that I could, and, with back&#xD;
stinging with pain, went about my work.&#xD;
The following day, Sunday, my thoughts were upon&#xD;
Bass, and the probabilities and hopes which hung&#xD;
upon his action and determination. I considered the&#xD;
uncertainty of life ; that if it should be the will of&#xD;
God that he should die, my prospect of deliverance, and&#xD;
all expectation of happiness in this world, would be&#xD;
wholly ended and destroyed. My sore back, perhaps,&#xD;
did not have a tendency to render m unusually.cheer-&#xD;
ful. I felt down-hearted and unhap all day long,&#xD;
and when I laid down upon the. hard board at night,&#xD;
my heart was oppressed  with such a load of grief, it&#xD;
seemed that it must break.&#xD;
Monday morning, the third of January, 1853, we&#xD;
were in the field betimes. It was a raw, cold morn-&#xD;
ing, such as is unusual in that region. I was in ad-&#xD;
vance, Uncle Abram next to me, behind him Bob,&#xD;
Patsey and Wiley, with our cotton-bags about our&#xD;

&#xD;
necks. Epps happened (a rare thing, indeed,) to come&#xD;
out that morning without his whip.,. He swore, in a&#xD;
manner that would shame a pirate, that we were do-&#xD;
ing nothing. Bob ventured to say that his fingers&#xD;
were so numb with cold he couldn't pick fast. Epps&#xD;
cursed himself for not having brought his rawhide,&#xD;
and declared that when he came out again he would&#xD;
warm us well; yes, he would make us all hotter than&#xD;
that fiery realm in which I am sometimes compelled&#xD;
to believe he will himself eventually reside.&#xD;
With these fervent expressions, he left us. When&#xD;
out of hearing, we commenced talking to each other,&#xD;
saying how hard it was to be compelled to keep up.&#xD;
our tasks with numb fingers ; hoav unreasonable mas-&#xD;
ter was, and speaking of him generally in no flatter-&#xD;
ing terms. Our conversation was interrupted by a&#xD;
carriage passing rapidly towards the house. Looking&#xD;
up, we saw two men approaching us through the cot-&#xD;
ton-field.&#xD;
Having now brought down this narrative to the last&#xD;
hour I was to spend on Bayou Bouf.--having got-&#xD;
ten through my last cotton picking, and about to bid&#xD;
Master Epps farewell-I must beg the reader to go&#xD;
back with me to the month of August ; to follow Bass'&#xD;
letter on its long journey to Saratoga; to learn the&#xD;
effect it produced -and that, while I was repining&#xD;
and despairing in the slave hut of Edwin Epps,&#xD;
through the friendship of Bass and the goodness of&#xD;
Providence, all things were working together for my&#xD;
deliverance.&#xD;

The letter written by Bass, directed to Parker and&#xD;
Perry, and which was deposited in the post-office in&#xD;
Marksville on the 15th day of August, 1852, arrived&#xD;
at Saratoga in the early part of September. Some&#xD;
time previous to this, Anne had removed to Glens&#xD;
Falls, Warren county,'where she had charge of the&#xD;
kitchen in Carpenter's Hotel. She kept house, how-&#xD;
ever, lodging with our children, and was only absent&#xD;

ANNE'S MEMORIAL TO THE GOVERNOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
Messrs. Parker and Perry, on receipt of the letter,&#xD;
forwarded it immediately to Anne. On reading it&#xD;
the children were all excitement, and without delay&#xD;
hastened to the neighboring village of Sandy Hill,&#xD;
to consult Henry B. Northup, and obtain his advice&#xD;
and assistance in the matter.&#xD;
Upon examination, that gentleman 'found among&#xD;
the statutes of the State an act providing for the re-&#xD;
covery of free citizens from slavery. It was passed&#xD;
May 14, 1840, and is entitled "An act more effectu-&#xD;
ally to protect the free citizens of this State from&#xD;
being kidnapped or reduced to slavery."  It provides&#xD;
that it shall be the duty of the Governor, upon the re-&#xD;
ceipt of satisfactory information that any free citizen or&#xD;
inhabitant of this State, is wrongfully held in another&#xD;
State or Territory of the United States, upon the al-&#xD;
legation or pretence that such person is a slave, or&#xD;
by color of any usage or rule of law is deemed or&#xD;
taken to'be a slave, to take such measures to procure&#xD;
the restoration of such person to liberty, as.he shall&#xD;
deem necessary. And to that end, he is authorized&#xD;
to appoint and employ an agent, and directed to fur-&#xD;
nish him with such credentials and instructions as will&#xD;
be likely to accomplish the object of his appointment.&#xD;
It requires the agent so appointed to proceed to col-&#xD;
lect the proper proof to establish the right of such&#xD;
person to his freedom; to perform such journeys, take&#xD;
such measures, institute such legal proceedings, &amp;amp;c.,&#xD;
as may be necessary to return such person to this&#xD;
State, and charges all expenses incurred in carrying&#xD;
&#xD;
the act into effect, upon -moneys not. otherwise ap-&#xD;
propriated in the treasury.*  ,&#xD;
It was necessary to establish two facts to the satis-&#xD;
faction of the Governor: First, that I was a free citi-&#xD;
zen of New-York; and secondly, that I was wrong-&#xD;
fully held in bondage. As to the first point, there&#xD;
was no difficulty, all the older inhabitants in the vi-&#xD;
cinity being ready to testify to it. The second point&#xD;
rested entirely upon the letter to Parker and Perry,&#xD;
written in an unknown hand, and upon the letter pen-&#xD;
ned on board the brig Orleans, which, unfortunately,&#xD;
had been mislaid or lost.&#xD;
A memorial was prepared, directed to his excellen-&#xD;
cy, Governor Hunt, setting forth her marriage, my&#xD;
departure to Washington city ; the receipt of the let-&#xD;
ters ; that I was a free citizen, and such other facts as&#xD;
were deemed important, and was signed and verified&#xD;
by Anne. Accompanying this memorial were sever-&#xD;
al affidavits of prominent citizens of Sandy Hill and&#xD;
Fort Edward, corroborating fully the statements it&#xD;
contained, and also a request of several well known&#xD;
gentlemen to the Governor, that Henry B. Northup&#xD;

be most likely to accomplish it, and instructing him&#xD;
to proceed to Louisiana with all conveniAnt dispatch.*&#xD;
The pressing nature of Mr. Northup's professional&#xD;
and political engagements delayed his departure un-&#xD;
til December. On the fourteenth day of that month&#xD;
he left Sandy Hill, and proceeded to Washington.&#xD;
The Hon. Pierre Soule, Senator in Congress from Lou-&#xD;
isiana, Hon. Mr. Conrad, Secretary of War, and&#xD;
Judge Nelson, of the Supreme Court of the United&#xD;
States, upon hearing a statement of the facts, and ex-&#xD;
amining his commission, and certified copies of the&#xD;
memorial and affidavits, furnished him with open let-&#xD;
ters to gentlemen in Louisiana, strongly urging their&#xD;
assistance in accomplishing the object of, his ap-&#xD;
pointment.&#xD;
Senator Soule especially interested himself in the&#xD;
matter, insisting, in forcible language, that it was the&#xD;
duty and interest of every planter in his State to aid&#xD;
in restoring me to freedom, and trusted the sentiments&#xD;
of honor and justice in the bosom of every citizen of&#xD;
the commonwealth would enlist him at once in my&#xD;
behalf. Having obtained these valuable letters, Mr.&#xD;
Northup returned to Baltimore, and proceeded from&#xD;
thence to Pittsburgh. It was his original intention,&#xD;
under advice of friends at Washington, to go directly&#xD;
to New Orleans, and consult the. authorities of that&#xD;
city. Providentially, however, on arriving at the&#xD;
mouth of Red River, he changed his mind. iad he&#xD;
continued on, he would not have met with Bass, in&#xD;
* See Appendix B.&#xD;
&#xD;
which case the search for me would probably have&#xD;
been fruitless.&#xD;
Taking passage on the first steamer that arrived,&#xD;
he pursued his journey up Red River, a sluggish,&#xD;
winding stream, flowing through a vast region of&#xD;
primitive forests and impenetrable swamps, almost&#xD;
Vholly destitute of inhabitants. About nine o'clock in&#xD;
the forenoon, January 1st, 1853, he left the steamboat&#xD;
at Marksville, and proceeded directly to Marksville&#xD;
Court house, a small village four miles in the interior.&#xD;
From the fact that the letter to Messrs. Parker and&#xD;
Perry was post-marked at Marksville, it was supposed&#xD;
by him that I was in that place or its immediate vi-&#xD;
cinity. On reaching this town, he at once laid his&#xD;
business before the Hon. John P. Waddill, a legal&#xD;
gentleman of distinction, and a man of fine genius&#xD;
and most noble impulses. After reading the letters&#xD;
and documents presented him, and listening to a rep-&#xD;
resentation of the circumstances under which I had&#xD;
been carried away into captivity, Mr. Waddill at&#xD;
once proffered his services, and entered into the af-&#xD;
fair with great zeal and earnestness. He;in common&#xD;
with others of like elevated character, looked upon&#xD;
the kidnapper with abhorrence. The title of his fel-&#xD;
low parishioners and clients to the property which&#xD;
constituted the larger proportion of their wealth, not&#xD;
only depended upon the good faith in which slave&#xD;
sales were transacted, but he was a man in whose&#xD;
honorable heart emotions of indignation were aroused&#xD;
by such an instance of injustice.&#xD;

&#xD;
Marksville, although occupying a prominent posi-&#xD;
tion, and standing out in impressive italics on the&#xD;
map of Louisiana, is, in fact, but a small and insig-&#xD;
nificant hamlet. Aside from the tavern, kept by a&#xD;
jolly and generous boniface, the court house, inhabi-&#xD;
ted by lawless cows and swine in the seasons of va-&#xD;
cation, and a high gallows, with its dissevered rope&#xD;
dangling in the air, there is little to attract the at-&#xD;
tention of the stranger.&#xD;
Solomon Northup was a name Mr. Waddill had&#xD;
never heard, but he was 'confident that if there was&#xD;
a slave bearing that appellation in Marksville or vi-&#xD;
cinity, his black boy Tom would know him. Tom&#xD;
was accordingly called, but in all his extensive cir-&#xD;
cle of acquaintances there was no such personage.&#xD;
The letter to Parker and Perry was dated at Bayou&#xD;
Bceuf. At this place, therefore, the conclusion was,&#xD;
I must be sought. But here a difficulty suggested&#xD;
itself, of a very grave character indeed. Bayou Bceuf,&#xD;
at its nearest point, was twenty-three miles distant,&#xD;
and was the name applied to the section of country&#xD;
extending between fifty and a hundred miles, on&#xD;
both sides of that stream. Thousands and thousands&#xD;
of slaves resided upon its shores, the remarkable.&#xD;
richness and fertility of the soil having attracted&#xD;
thither a great number of planters. The information&#xD;
in the letter was so vague and indefinite as to render&#xD;
it difficult to conclude upon any specific course of&#xD;
proceeding. It was finally dc termined, however, as&#xD;
the only plan that presented any prospect of success,&#xD;
&#xD;
NEW-YORK POLITICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
295&#xD;
&#xD;
that Northup and the brother of Waddill, a student&#xD;
in the office of the.latter, should repair to the Bayou,&#xD;
and traveling up o'ne side and down the other its&#xD;
whole length, inquire at each plantation for me. Mr.&#xD;
Waddill tendered the use of his carriage, and it- was&#xD;
definitely arranged that they should start upon the&#xD;
excursion early Monday morning.&#xD;
It will be seen at once that this course, in all prob-&#xD;
ability, would have resulted unsuccessfully. It would&#xD;
have been impossible for them to have gone into the&#xD;
fields and examine all the gangs at work. They&#xD;
were not aware that I was known only as Platt; and&#xD;
had they inquired of Epps himself, he would have&#xD;
stated truly that he knew nothing of Solomon&#xD;
Northup.&#xD;
The arrangement being adopted, however, there&#xD;
was nothing further to be done until Sunday had&#xD;
elapsed. The conversation between Messrs. Northup&#xD;
and Waddill, in the course of the afternoon, turned&#xD;
upon New-York politics.&#xD;
"I can scarcely comprehend the nice distinc-&#xD;
tions and shades of political parties in- your State,"&#xD;
observed Mr. Waddill. "I read of soft-shells and&#xD;
hard-shells, hunkers and barnburners, woolly-heads&#xD;
and silver-grays, and am unable to understand the&#xD;
precise difference between them. Pray, what is it ?"&#xD;
Mr. Northup, re-filling his pipe, entered into quite&#xD;
an elaborate narrative of the origin of the various&#xD;
sections of parties, and concluded by saying there was&#xD;
another party in New-York, known as free-soilers or&#xD;

&#xD;
abolitionists. "You have seen none of those in this&#xD;
part of the country, I presume ?" Mr. Northup re-&#xD;
marked.&#xD;
"Never, but one," answered Waddill, laughingly.&#xD;
" We have one here in Marksville, an eccentric crea-&#xD;
ture, who preaches abolitionism as vehemently as any&#xD;
fanatic at the North. lHe is a generous, iqpffensive&#xD;
man, but always maintaining the wrong side of an"&#xD;
argument. It affords us a deal of amusement. He&#xD;
is an excellent mechanic, and almost indispensable in&#xD;
this community. He is ,a carpenter. His name .is&#xD;
Bass."&#xD;
Some further good-natured conversation wasihad at&#xD;
the expense of Bass' peculiarities, when Waddill all&#xD;
at once fell into a reflective mood, and asked for the&#xD;
mysterious letter again.&#xD;
"Let me see -1-e-t m-e s-e-e !" he repeated,&#xD;
thoughtfully to himself, running his eyes over the let-&#xD;
ter once more. "'Bayou Buf, August 15.' August&#xD;
15 --post-marked here. 'lHe that is writing for me -'&#xD;
Where did Bass work last summer ?" he inquired,&#xD;
turning suddenly to his brother. His brother was&#xD;
unable to inform him, but rising, left the office, and&#xD;
soon returned with the intelligence that "Bass work-&#xD;
ed last summer somewhere on bayou Bceuf."&#xD;
"He is the man,"'bringing down his hand emphat-&#xD;
ically on the table,"'who can tell us all about Sol-&#xD;
omon Northup," exclaimed Waddill.&#xD;
Bass was immediately searched for, but could not&#xD;
be found. After some inquiry, it was ascertained he&#xD;
&#xD;
was at the landing on Red River. Procuring a con-&#xD;
veyance, young Waddill and Northup were not long&#xD;
in traversing the few miles to the latter place. On&#xD;
their arrival, Bass was found, just on the point of leav-&#xD;
ing, to be absent a fortnight or more. After an in-&#xD;
troduction, Northup begged the privilege of speaking&#xD;
to him privately a moment. They walked together&#xD;
towards the river, when the following conversation&#xD;
ensued:&#xD;
"Mr. Bass," said Northup, "allow me to ask you&#xD;
if you were on Bayou Boouf last August?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I was there in August," was the reply.&#xD;
"Did you write a letter for a colored man at that&#xD;
place to some gentleman in Saratoga Springs?"&#xD;
" Excuse me, sir, if I say that is none of your busi-&#xD;
ness," answered Bass, stopping and looking his inter-&#xD;
rogator searchingly in the face.&#xD;
" Perhaps I am rather hasty, Mr. Bass ; I beg your&#xD;
pardon; but I have come from the State of New-York&#xD;
to accomplish the purpose the writer of a letter dated&#xD;
the 15th of August, post-marked at Marksville, had&#xD;
in view. Circumstances have led me to think that&#xD;
you are perhaps the man who wrote it. I am in&#xD;
search of Solomon Northup. If you know him, I beg&#xD;
you to inform me-frankly where he is, and I assure&#xD;
you the source of any information you may give me&#xD;
shall not be divulged, if you desire itnot to be."&#xD;
A long time. Bass looked his new acquaintance&#xD;
steadily in the eyes, without opening his lips. He&#xD;
seemed to be doubting in his own mind if there was&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC7339-00000154"/>&#xD;
298          TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE.&#xD;
&#xD;
not an attempt to practice some deception upon him.&#xD;
Finally he said, deliberately -.-&#xD;
"I have done nothing to be ashamed of. I am the&#xD;
man who wrote the letter. If you have come to res-&#xD;
cue Solomon Northup, I am glad to see you."&#xD;
"When did you last see him, and where is he?"&#xD;
Northup inquired.&#xD;
"I last saw him Christmas, a week ago to-day.&#xD;
He is the slave of Edwin Epps, a planter on Bayou&#xD;
Boeuf, near Holmesville. He is not known as Solo-&#xD;
mon Northup ; he is called Platt."&#xD;
The secret was out -the mystery was unraveled.&#xD;
Through the thick, black cloud, amid whose dark and&#xD;
dismal shadows I had walked twelve years, broke the&#xD;
star that was to light me back to liberty. All mis-&#xD;
trust and hesitation were soon thrown aside, and the&#xD;
two men conversed long and freely upon the subject&#xD;
uppermost in their thoughts. Bass expressed the&#xD;
interest he had taken in my behalf-.his intention of&#xD;
going north in the Spring, and declaring that he had&#xD;
resolved to accomplish my emancipation, if it were in&#xD;
his power. He described the commencement and&#xD;
progress of his acquaintance with me, and listened&#xD;
with eager curiosity to the account given him of my&#xD;
family, and the history of my early life. Before sep-&#xD;
arating, he drew a map of the bayou on a strip of paper&#xD;
with a piece of red chalk, showing the locality of Epps'&#xD;
plantation, and the road leading most directly to it.&#xD;
Northup and his young companion returned to&#xD;
Marksville, where it was determined to commence&#xD;
&#xD;
legal proceedings to test the question of my right to&#xD;
freedom. I was made plaintiff, Mr. Northup acting&#xD;
as my guardian, and Edwin Epps defendant. The&#xD;
process to be issued was in the nature of replevin, di-&#xD;
rected to the sheriff of the parish, commanding .him&#xD;
to take me into custody, and detain me until the de-&#xD;
cision of the court. By the time the papers were duly&#xD;
drawn up, it was twelve o'clock at night - too late to&#xD;
obtain the necessary signature of the Judge, who resi-&#xD;
ded some distance out of town, Further business was&#xD;
therefore suspended until Monday morning.&#xD;
Everything, apparently, was moving along swim-&#xD;
mingly, until Sunday afternoon, when Waddill called&#xD;
at Northup's room to express his apprehension of dif-&#xD;
ficulties they had not expected to encounter.. Bass&#xD;
had become alarmed, and had placed his affairs in&#xD;
the hands of a person at the landing, communicating&#xD;
to him his intention of leaving the State. This per-.&#xD;
son had betrayed the confidence reposed in him to a&#xD;
certain extent, and a rumor began to float about the&#xD;
town, that the stranger at the hotel, who had been&#xD;
observed in the company of lawyer Waddill, was after&#xD;
one of old Epps' slaves, over on the bayou. Epps&#xD;
was known at Marksville, having frequent occasion&#xD;
to visit that place during the session of the courts, and&#xD;
the fear entertained 'by Mr. Northup's adviser was,&#xD;
that- intelligence would be conveyed to him in the&#xD;
night, giving him an opportunity of secreting me be-&#xD;
fore. the arrival of the sheriff.&#xD;
This apprehension had the effect of expediting mat-&#xD;

ters considerably. The sheriff, who lived in one direc-&#xD;
tion from the village, was requested to hold himself&#xD;
in readiness immediately after midnight, while the&#xD;
Judge was informed he would be called upon at the&#xD;
same time. It is but justice to say, that the authori-&#xD;
ties at Marksville cheerfully rendered all the assist-&#xD;
ance in their power.&#xD;
As soon after midnight as bail could be perfected,&#xD;
and the Judge's signature obtained, a carriage, con-&#xD;
taining Mr. Northup and the sheriff, driven by the&#xD;
landlord's son, rolled rapidly out of the village of&#xD;
Marksville, on the road towards Bayou Boeuf.&#xD;
It was supposed that Epps would contest the issue&#xD;
involving my right to liberty, and it therefore sug-&#xD;
gested itself to Mr. Northup, that the testimony of the&#xD;
sheriff, describing my first meeting with the for-&#xD;
mer, might perhaps become material on the trial.&#xD;
It was accordingly arranged during the ride, that,&#xD;
before I had an opportunity of speaking to Mr.&#xD;
Northup, the sheriff should propound to me cer-&#xD;
tain questions agreed upon, such as the number and&#xD;
names of my children, the name of my wife before&#xD;
marriage, of places I knew at the North, and so forth.&#xD;
If my answers corresponded with the statements giv-&#xD;
en him, the evidence must necessarily be considered&#xD;
conclusive.&#xD;
At length, shortly after Epps had left the field, with&#xD;
the consoling assurance that he would soon return and&#xD;
warm us, as was stated in the conclusion of the pre-&#xD;
ceding chapter, they came in sight of the plantation,&#xD;
&#xD;
301&#xD;
&#xD;
and discovered us at work. Alighting from the car-&#xD;
riage, and directing the driver to proceed to the great&#xD;
house, with instructions not to mention to any one&#xD;
the obj ect of their errand until they met again, North-&#xD;
up and the sheriff turned from the highway, and came&#xD;
towards us across the cotton field. We observed them,&#xD;
on looking up at the carriage - one several rods in&#xD;
advance of the other. It was a singular and unusual&#xD;
thing to see white men approaching us in that man-&#xD;
ner, and especially at that early hour in the morning,&#xD;
and Uncle Abram and Patsey made some remarks,&#xD;
expressive of their astonishment. Walking up to&#xD;
Bob,' the sheriff inquired:&#xD;
"Where's the boy they call Platt?"&#xD;
" Thar he is, massa," answered Bob, pointing to me,&#xD;
and twitching off his -hat.&#xD;
I wondered to myself what business he could pos-&#xD;
sibly have with me, and turning round, gazed at him&#xD;
until he had approached within a step. During my&#xD;
long residence on the bayou, I had become. familiar&#xD;
with the face of every planter within many miles ;&#xD;
but this man was an utter stranger - certainly I had&#xD;
never seen him before.&#xD;
"Your name is Platt, is it?" he asked.&#xD;
"Yes, master," I responded.&#xD;
Pointing towards Northup, standing a few rods dis-&#xD;
tant, he demanded -" Do you know that man?"&#xD;
I looked in the direction indicated, and as my eyes&#xD;
rested on his countenance, a world of images thronged&#xD;
my brain ; a multitude of well-known faces - Anne's,&#xD;

and the dear children's, and my old dead father's; all&#xD;
the scenes and associations of childhood and youth;&#xD;
all the friends of other and happier days, appeared&#xD;
and disappeared, flitting and floating like dissolving&#xD;
shadows before the vision of my imagination, until at&#xD;
last the perfect memory of the man recurred to me,&#xD;
and throwing up my hands towards Heaven, I ex-&#xD;
claimed, in a voice louder than I could utter in a less&#xD;
exciting moment -&#xD;
"Henry B. Northup! Thank God -thank God!"&#xD;
In an instant I comprehended the nature of his busi-&#xD;
ness, and felt that the hour of my deliverance was at&#xD;
hand. I started towards him, but the sheriff stepped&#xD;
before me.&#xD;
"Stop a moment," said he; "have you any other&#xD;
name than Platt?"&#xD;
"Solomon Northup is my name, master," I replied.&#xD;
"Have you a family? " he inquired.&#xD;
"I had a wife and three children."&#xD;
"What were your children's names ? "&#xD;
"Elizabeth,. Margaret and Alonzo."&#xD;
"And your wife's name before her marriage"&#xD;
" Anne Hampton."&#xD;
"Who married you?"&#xD;
"Timothy Eddy, of Fort Edward."&#xD;
"Where does that gentleman live? " again pointing&#xD;
to Northup, who remained standing in the same place&#xD;
where I had first recognized him.&#xD;
"He lives in Sandy Hill, Washington county, New&#xD;
York," was the reply.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MEETING.&#xD;
&#xD;
303&#xD;
&#xD;
He was proceeding to ask further questions, but I&#xD;
pushed past him, unable longer to restrain myself.&#xD;
I seized my old acquaintance by both hands. I could&#xD;
not speak. I could not refrain from tears.&#xD;
"Sol," he said at length, "I'm glad to see you."&#xD;
I essayed to make some answer, but emotion choked&#xD;
all utterance, and I was silent. The slaves, utterly&#xD;
confounded, stood gazing upon the scene, their open&#xD;
mouths and rolling eyes indicating the utmost wonder&#xD;
and astonishment. For ten years I had dwelt among&#xD;
them, in the field and in the cabin, borne the same&#xD;
hardships, partaken the same fare, mingled my griefs&#xD;
with theirs, participated in the same scanty joys;&#xD;
nevertheless, not until this hour, the'last I was to re-&#xD;
main among them, had the remotest suspicion of my&#xD;
true name, or the slightest knowledge of my real his-&#xD;
tory, been entertained by any one of them.&#xD;
Not a word was spoken for several minutes, during&#xD;
which time I clung fast to Northup, looking up into&#xD;
his face, fearful I should awake and find it all a&#xD;
dream.&#xD;
"Throw down that sack," Northup added, finally;&#xD;
"your cotton-picking days are over. Come with us&#xD;
to the man you live with."&#xD;
I obeyed him, and walking between him and the&#xD;
sheriff, we moved ,towards the great house. It was&#xD;
not until we had proceeded some distance that I had&#xD;
recovered my voice sufficiently to ask if my family&#xD;
were all living. He informed me he had seen Anne,&#xD;
Margaret and Elizabeth but a short time previously;&#xD;

that Alonzo was also living, and all were well. My&#xD;
mother, however, I could never see again. As I be-&#xD;
gan to recover in some measure from the sudden and&#xD;
great excitement which so overwhelmed me, I grew&#xD;
faint and weak, insomuch it was with difficulty I could&#xD;
walk. The sheriff took hold of my arm and assisted&#xD;
me, or I think I should have fallen. As we entered&#xD;
the yard, Epps stood by the gate, conversing with the&#xD;
driver. That young man, faithful to his instructions,&#xD;
was entirely unable to give him the least information&#xD;
in answer to his repeated.inquiries of what was going&#xD;
on. By the time we reached him he was almost as&#xD;
much amazed and puzzled as Bob or Uncle Abram.&#xD;
Shaking hands with the sheriff, and receiving an&#xD;
introduction to Mr. Northup, he invited them into the&#xD;
house, ordering me, at the same time, to bring in&#xD;
some wood. It was some time before I succeeded in&#xD;
cutting an armful, having, somehow, unaccountably&#xD;
lost the power of wielding the axe with any manner&#xD;
of precision. When I entered With it at last, the&#xD;
table was strewn with papers, from one of which&#xD;
Northup was reading. I was probably longer than&#xD;
necessity required, in placing the sticks upon the fire,&#xD;
being particular as to the exact position of each indi-&#xD;
vidual one of them. I heard the words, "the said&#xD;
Solomon Northup," and "the deponent further says,"&#xD;
and " free citizen of New-York," repeated frequently,&#xD;
and from these expressions understood that the secret&#xD;
I had so long retained from Master and Mistress Epps,&#xD;
was finally developing. I lingered as long as pru-&#xD;

when Epps inquired,&#xD;
"Platt, do you know this gentleman?"&#xD;
"Yes, master," I replied, "I have known him as&#xD;

"Where does he live?"&#xD;
"He lives in New-York."&#xD;
"Did you ever live there?"&#xD;
"Yes, master -born and bred there."&#xD;
"You was free, then. Now you d.- d nigger,"&#xD;
he exclaimed, "why did you not tell me that when I&#xD;
bought you?"&#xD;
"Master Epps," I answered, in a somewhat differ-&#xD;
ent tone than the one in which I had been accustomed&#xD;
to address him - " Master Epps, you did not take the&#xD;
trouble to ask me ; besides, I told one of my owners -&#xD;
the man that kidnapped me - that :I was free, and&#xD;
was whipped almost to death for it."&#xD;
"It seems there has been a letter written for you by&#xD;
somebody. Now, who is it? " he demanded, authori-&#xD;
tatively. I made no reply.&#xD;
"I say, who wrote that letter?" he demanded&#xD;
again.&#xD;
" Perhaps I wrote it myself," I said.&#xD;
"You. haven't been to. Marksville post-office and&#xD;

I would not. He made many vehement threats against&#xD;

unknown person who had written for me, and of fret-&#xD;
fulness at the idea of losing so much property. Ad-&#xD;
dressing Mr. Northup, he swore if he had only had an&#xD;
hour's notice of his coming, he would have saved him&#xD;
the trouble of taking me back to New-York; that he&#xD;
would have run me into the swamp, or some, other&#xD;
place out of the way, where all the sheriffs on earth&#xD;
couldn't have found me.&#xD;
I walked out into the yard, and was entering the&#xD;
kitchen door, when something struck me in the back.&#xD;
Aunt Phebe, emerging from the back door of the&#xD;
great house with a pan of potatoes, had thrown one&#xD;
of them with unnecessary violence, thereby giving&#xD;
me to understand that she wished to speak to me a&#xD;
moment confidentially. Running up to me, she whis-&#xD;
pered in my ear with great earnestness,&#xD;
" Lor a' mity, Platt! what d'ye think ? Dem two&#xD;
men come after ye. Heard 'em tell massa you free -&#xD;
got wife and tree children back thar whar you come&#xD;
from. Going' wid 'em? Fool if ye don't - wish I&#xD;
could go," and Aunt Phebe ran on in this manner at&#xD;
a rapid rate.&#xD;
Presently Mistress Epps made her appearance in&#xD;
the kitchen. She said many things to me, and won-&#xD;
dered why I had not told her who I was. She ex-&#xD;
pressed her regret, complimenting re by saying she&#xD;
had rather lose any other servant on the plantation.&#xD;
Had Patsey that day stood in my place, the measure&#xD;
&#xD;
of my mistress' joy would have. overflowed. Now&#xD;
there was no one left who could mend a chair or a&#xD;
piece of furniture -no one who was of any use about&#xD;
the house -no one who could play for her on the vio-&#xD;
lin-and Mistress Epps was actually affected to tears.&#xD;
Epps had called to Bob to bring up his saddle horse.&#xD;
The other slaves, also, overcoming their fear of the&#xD;
penalty, had left their work and come to the yard.&#xD;
They were standing behind the cabins, out of sight of&#xD;
Epps. They beckoned me to come to them, and with&#xD;
all the eagerness of curiosity, excited to the highest&#xD;
pitch, conversed with and questioned me. If I could&#xD;
repeat the exact words they uttered, with the same&#xD;
emphasis-if I could paint their several attitudes, and&#xD;
the expression of their countenances -it would be&#xD;
indeed an interesting picture. In their estimation, I&#xD;
had suddenly arisen to an immeasurable height -had&#xD;
become a being of immense importance.&#xD;
The legal papers having been served, and arrange-&#xD;
ments made with Epps to meet them the next day at&#xD;
Marksville, Northup and the sheriff entered the&#xD;
carriage to return to the latter place. As I was about&#xD;
mounting to the driver's seat, the sheriff said I ought&#xD;
to bid Mr. and Mrs. Epps good bye. I ran back to&#xD;
the piazza where they were standing, and taking off&#xD;
my hat, said,&#xD;
"Good-bye, missis."&#xD;
" Good-bye, Platt," said Mrs. Epps, kindly.&#xD;
"Good-bye, master."&#xD;
"Ah! you d-d nigger," muttered Epps, in a surly,&#xD;

malicious tone of voice, "you needn't feel so cussed&#xD;
tickled --you ain't gone yet - I'll see about this busi-&#xD;
ness at Marksville to-morrow."&#xD;
I was only a "nigger" and knew my place, but felt&#xD;
as strongly as if I had been a white man, that it&#xD;
would have been an inward comfort, had I dared to&#xD;
have given him a parting kick. . On my.way back .to&#xD;
the carriage, Patsey ran from behind a cabin and&#xD;
threw her arms about my neck.&#xD;
"Oh ! Platt," she cried, tears streaming down her,&#xD;
face, "you're goin' to be free -you're goin' way off&#xD;
yonder where we'll neber see ye any more. You've&#xD;
saved me a good many whippins, Platt; I'm glad&#xD;
you're goin' to be free --but oh ! do Lord, de Lord!&#xD;
what'll become of me?"&#xD;
I disengaged myself from her, and entered the&#xD;
carriage. The driver cracked his whip and away we&#xD;
rolled. I looked back and saw Patsey, with drooping&#xD;
head, half reclining on the ground; Mrs. Epps was on&#xD;
the piazza; Uncle Abram, and Bob, and Wiley, and&#xD;
Aunt Phebe stood by the gate, gazing after me. I&#xD;
waved my hand, but the carriage turned a bend of&#xD;
the bayou, hiding them from my eyes forever.&#xD;
We stopped a moment at Carey's sugar house,&#xD;
where a great number of slaves were at work, such&#xD;
an establishment being a curiosity to a Northern man.&#xD;
Epps dashed by us on horseback at full speed-on&#xD;
the way, as we learned next day,, to the "Pine&#xD;
Woods," to see William Ford, who had brought me&#xD;
into the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tuesday, the fourth of January, Epps and his coun-&#xD;
sel, the Hon. H. Taylor, Northup, Waddill, the Judge&#xD;
and sheriff of Avoyelles, and myself, met in a room&#xD;
in the village of Marksville. Mr. Northup stated the&#xD;
facts in regard to me, and presented his commission,&#xD;
and the affidavits accompanying it. The sheriff de-&#xD;
scribed the scene in the cotton field. I was also&#xD;
interrogated at great length. Finally, Mr. Taylor&#xD;
assured his client that he was satisfied, and that liti-&#xD;
gatioii would not only be expensive, but utterly use-&#xD;
less. In accordance with his advice, a paper was&#xD;
drawn up and signed by the proper parties, wherein&#xD;
Epps acknowledged he was satisfied of my right to&#xD;
freedom, and formally surrendered me to the authori-&#xD;
ties of New-York. It. was also stipulated that it be&#xD;
entered of record in the recorder's office of Avoy-&#xD;
elles.*&#xD;
Mr. Northup and myself immediately hastened to&#xD;
the landing, and taking passage on the first steamer&#xD;
that arrived, were soon floating down Red River, up&#xD;
which, with such desponding thoughts, I had been&#xD;
borne twelve years before.&#xD;

As the steamer glided on its way towards New-&#xD;
Orleans, perhaps I was, not happy --perhaps there&#xD;
was no difficulty in restraining myself from dancing&#xD;
round the deck - perhaps I did not feel grateful to&#xD;
the man who had come so many hundred miles for&#xD;
me     perhaps I did not light his pipe, and wait and&#xD;
watch his word, and run at his slightest bidding. If&#xD;
I didn't - well, no matter.&#xD;
We tarried at New-Orleans two days. During that&#xD;
time I pointed out the locality of Freeman's slave&#xD;
pen, and the room in which Ford purchased me.        We&#xD;
happened to meet Theophilus in the street, but I did&#xD;
not think it worth while to renew    acquaintance with.&#xD;
him.   From   respectable citizens we ascertained he&#xD;
had become a low, miserable rowdy -      a broken-down,&#xD;
disreputable man.&#xD;
&#xD;
We also visited the recorder, Mr. Genois, to whom&#xD;
Senator Soule's letter was directed, and found him a&#xD;
man well deserving the wide and honorable reputa-&#xD;
tion that he bears. lHe very generously furnished us&#xD;
with a sort of legal pass, over his signature and seal&#xD;
of office, and as it contains the recorder's description&#xD;
of my personal appearance, it may not be amiss .to in-&#xD;
sert it here.  The following is a cop:&#xD;
"State of Louisiana-City of New- Orleans:&#xD;
Recorder's Office, Second District.&#xD;
"To all to whom these presents shall come :&#xD;
" This is to certify that Henry B. Northup, Esquire, of the&#xD;
county of Washington, New-York, has produced before me due&#xD;
evidence ,of the freedom of Solomon, a mulatto man aged&#xD;
about forty-two years, five feet, seven inches and six lines, woolly&#xD;
hair, and chestnut eyes, who is a native born of the State of&#xD;
New-York. That the said Northup, being about bringing the&#xD;
said Solomon to his native place, through the southern routes,&#xD;
the civil authorities are requested to let the aforesaid color-&#xD;
ed man Solomon pass unmolested, he demeaning well and&#xD;
properly.&#xD;
"Given under my hand and the seal of the city of New-Or&#xD;
leans this 7th January, 1853.&#xD;
[L. s.]                "TH. GENOIS, Recorder."&#xD;
On the 8th we came to Lake Pontchartrain, by rail-&#xD;
road, and, in due time, following the usual route,&#xD;
reached Charleston.   After going on board the steam-&#xD;
boat, and paying our. passage at this city, Mr. North-&#xD;
up was called upon by a custom-house officer to ex-&#xD;
plain why he had not registered his servant. He&#xD;

&#xD;
replied that he had no servant - that, as the agent of&#xD;
New-York, he was accompanying a free citizen of that,&#xD;
State from slavery to freedom, and did not desire nor&#xD;
intend to make any registry whatever. I conceived&#xD;
from his conversation and manner, though I may per-&#xD;
haps be entirely mistaken, that no great pains would&#xD;
be taken to avoid whatever difficulty;the Charleston&#xD;
officials, might deem proper to create. At length,&#xD;
however, we were permitted to proceed, and, passing&#xD;
through Richmond, where I caught a glimpse of&#xD;
Goodin's pen, arrived in Washington January 17th,&#xD;
1853.&#xD;
We ascertained that both Burch and Radburn were&#xD;
still residing in that city. Immediately a complaint&#xD;
was entered with a police magistrate of Washington,&#xD;
against James H. Burch, for kidnapping and selling&#xD;
me into slavery. He was arrested upon a warrant&#xD;
issued by Justice Goddard, and returned before Jus-&#xD;
tice Mansel, and held to bail in the sum of three thou-&#xD;
sand dollars. When first arrested, Burch was much&#xD;
excited, exhibiting the utmost fear and alarm, and be-.&#xD;
fore reaching the justice's office on Louisiana Ave-&#xD;
nue, and before knowing the precise nature of the&#xD;
complaint, begged the police to permit him to consult&#xD;
Benjamin 0. Shekels, a slave trader of seventeen&#xD;
years' standing, and his former partner. The latter&#xD;
became his bail.&#xD;
At ten o'clock, the 18th of January, both parties&#xD;
appeared before the magistrate. Senator Chase,. of&#xD;
Ohio, lion. Orville Clark, of Sandy Hill, and Mr&#xD;
&#xD;
Northup acted as counsel for the prosecution, and Jo-&#xD;
seph H. Bradley for the defence.&#xD;
Gen. Orville Clark vas called and sworn as a wit-&#xD;
ness, and testified that he had known me from child-&#xD;
hood, and that I was.a free man, as was my father be-&#xD;
fore me. -.Mr. Northup then testified to the same, and&#xD;
proved the facts connected with his mission to Avoy-&#xD;
elles.&#xD;
Ebenezer Radburn was then sworn for the prosecu.&#xD;
tion, and testified he was forty-eight years old ; that&#xD;
he was a resident of Washington, and had known&#xD;
Burch fourteen years ; that in 1841 he was keeper of&#xD;
Williams' slave pen; that he remembered the fact of&#xD;
my confinement in the pen that year. At this point&#xD;
it was admitted by the defendant's counsel, that Ihad&#xD;
been placed in the pen by Burch in the spring of&#xD;
1841, and hereupon the prosecution rested.&#xD;
Benjamin O. Shekels was then offered as a witness&#xD;
by the prisoner. Benjamin is a large, coarse-featured&#xD;
man, and the reader may perhaps get a somewhat&#xD;
correct conception of him by reading the exact lan-&#xD;
guage he used in answer to the first question of de-&#xD;
fendant's lawyer. He was asked the place of his na-&#xD;
tivity, and his reply, uttered in a sort of rowdyish&#xD;
way, was in these verf words&#xD;
" I was born in Ontario county, New-York, and&#xD;
weighed fourteen pounds !"&#xD;
Benjamin was a prodigious baby! He further tes-&#xD;
tified that he kept the Steamboat Hotel in Washing-&#xD;
ton in 1841, and saw me there in the spring of that&#xD;

year. He was proceeding to state what he had heard&#xD;
two men say, when Senator Chase raised a legal ob-&#xD;
jection, to wit, that the sayings of third persons, be-&#xD;
ing hearsay, was improper evidence. The objection&#xD;
was overruled by the Justice, and Shekels continued,&#xD;
stating that two men came to his hotel and represent-&#xD;
ed they had a colored man for sale ; that they had an&#xD;
interview with Burch; that they stated they caine&#xD;
.from Georgia, but he did not remember the county;&#xD;
that they gave a full history of the boy, saying he was&#xD;
a bricklayer, and played on the violin ; that Burch&#xD;
remarked he would purchase if they could agree ; that&#xD;
they went out and brought the boy in, and that I was&#xD;
the same person.   He further testified, with as&#xD;
much unconcern as if it was the truth, that I rep-&#xD;
presented I was born and bred in Georgia; that&#xD;
one of the young men with me was niy master ; that&#xD;
I exhibited a great deal of regret at parting with him,&#xD;
and he believed "got into tears !" --nevertheless, that&#xD;
I insisted my master had a right to sell me ; that he&#xD;
ought to sell me ; and the remarkable reason I gave&#xD;
was,, according to Shekels, because he, .my master,&#xD;
"had been gambling and on a spree !" I&#xD;
He continued, in these words, copied from the min-&#xD;
utes taken on the examination: " Burch interrogated&#xD;
the boy in the usual manner, told him if he purchas-&#xD;
ed him he should send him south. The boy said he&#xD;
had no objection, that in fact he would like to go&#xD;
south. Burch paid $650 for him, to my knowledge.&#xD;
I don't know what name was given him, but think it&#xD;
&#xD;
was not Solomon. Did not know the name of either&#xD;
of the two men. They were in my tavern two or three&#xD;
hours, during which time the boy played on the vio-&#xD;
lin. The bill of sale was signed in my bar-room. It&#xD;
was a printed blank, filled up by Burch. Before1838&#xD;
B~urch was my partner. Our business was buying&#xD;
ahd selling slaves. After that time he was a partner&#xD;
of Theophilus Freeman, of New-Orleans. Burch&#xD;
bought here --Freeman sold there !"&#xD;
Shekels, before testifying, had heard my relation of&#xD;
the circumstances connected with the visit to Wash-&#xD;
ington with Brown and Hamilton, and therefore, it&#xD;
was, undoubtedly, he spoke of "two men," and of my&#xD;
playing on the violin. Such was his fabrication, ut-&#xD;
terly untrue, and yet there was found in Washington&#xD;
a man who endeavored to corroborate him.&#xD;
Benjamin A. Thorn testified he was at Shekels' in&#xD;
1841, and saw a colored boy playing on a fiddle.&#xD;
"Shekels said he was for sale. Heard his master tell&#xD;
hin~he should sell him. The boy acknowledged to me&#xD;
he. was a slave. I was not present when the money&#xD;
was paid. Will not swear positively this is the boy.&#xD;
The master came near shedding tears: I think the boy&#xD;
did! I have been engaged in the business of taking&#xD;
slaves south, off and on, for twenty years. When I&#xD;
can't do that I do something else."&#xD;
I was then offered as a witness, but, objection be-&#xD;
ing made, the court decided my evidence inadmissible.&#xD;
It was rejected solely on the ground that I was a col&#xD;

&#xD;
ored man -the fact of my being a free citizen of&#xD;
New-York not being disputed.&#xD;
Shekels having testified there was a bill of sale ex&#xD;
ecuted, Burch was called upon by the prosecution to&#xD;
produce it, inasmuch as such a paper would corrobo-&#xD;
rate the testimony of Thorn and Shekels. The pris-&#xD;
oner's counsel saw the necessity of exhibiting it, or&#xD;
giving some reasonable explanation for its non-pro-&#xD;
duction. To effect the latter, Burch himself was offer-&#xD;
as a witness in his own behalf. It was contended by&#xD;
counsel for the people, that such testimony should not&#xD;
be allowed - that it was in contravention of every&#xD;
rule of evidence, and if permitted would defeat the&#xD;
ends of justice. His testimony, however, was receiv-&#xD;
ed by the court ! He made oath that such a bill of&#xD;
sale had been drawn up and signed, but he hadlost it,&#xD;
and did not know what had become.of it! !Thereup-&#xD;
on the magistrate was requested to dispatch a police&#xD;
officer to Burch's residence, with directions to bring&#xD;
his books, containing his bills of sales for the year&#xD;
1841. The request was granted, and before any meas-&#xD;
ure could be taken to prevent it, the officer had ob-&#xD;
tained possession of the books, and brought them into&#xD;
court. The sales for the year 1841 were found, and&#xD;
carefully examined, but no sale of myself, by any&#xD;
name, was discovered!&#xD;
Upon this testimony the court held the fact to be&#xD;
established, that Burch came innocently and honestly&#xD;
by me, and accordingly he was discharged.&#xD;
&#xD;
316&#xD;
&#xD;

s&#xD;
&#xD;
An attempt was then made by Burch and his sat-&#xD;
ellites, to fasten upoi me the charge that I had con-&#xD;
spired with the two white men to defraud him-with&#xD;
what success, appears in an extract taken from an ar-&#xD;
ticle in the New-York Times, published a day or two&#xD;
subsequent to the trial: "The counsel for the defend-&#xD;
'ant had drawn up, before the defendant was dis-&#xD;
charged, an affidavit, signed by Burch, and had a&#xD;
warrant out against the colored man for a conspiracy&#xD;
with the two white men before referred to, to defraud&#xD;
Burch out of six hundred and twenty-five dollars.&#xD;
The warrant was served, and the colored man ai-rest-&#xD;
ed and brought before officer Goddard. Burch and&#xD;
his witnesses appeared in court, and H. B. Nortl~up&#xD;
appeared as counsel for the colored man, stating he&#xD;
was ready to proceed as counsel on the part of the de-&#xD;
fendant, and asking no delay whatever. Burch, after&#xD;
consulting privately a short time with Shekels, stated&#xD;
to the magistrate that he wished him to dismiss the&#xD;
complaint, as he would not proceed farther with it.&#xD;
Defendant's counsel stated to the magistrate that if&#xD;
the complaint was withdrawn, it must be without the&#xD;
request or consent of the defendan4. Burch then&#xD;
asked the magistrate to let him have the complaint&#xD;
and the warrant, and he took them. The counsel for&#xD;
the defendant objected to his receiving them, and in-&#xD;
sisted they should remain as part of the records of the&#xD;
court, and that the court should endorse the proceed-&#xD;
ings which had been had under the process. 'Burch&#xD;
'delivered them up, and the court rendered a judge.&#xD;

-nent of discontinuance 'by the request of the prosecu-&#xD;
tor, and filed it in his office. "&#xD;
There may be those who will affect to believe the&#xD;
statement of the slave-trader -those, in whose minds&#xD;
his allegations will weigh heavier than mine. I am a&#xD;
poor colored man -one of a down-trodden and de-&#xD;
graded race, whose humble voice may not be heeded&#xD;
by the oppressor -but knowing the truth, and with a&#xD;
full sense of my accountability, I do solemnly declare&#xD;
before men, and before God, that any charge or as-&#xD;
sertion, that I conspired directly or indirectly with&#xD;
any person or persons to sell myself; that any other&#xD;
account of my visit to Washington, my capture and&#xD;
imprisonment in Williams' slave pen, than is contain=&#xD;
ed in these pages, is utterly and absolutely false. I&#xD;
never played on the violin in Washington. I never&#xD;
was in the Steamboat Hotel, and never saw Thorn or&#xD;
Shekels, to my knowledge, in my life, until last Jan-&#xD;
uary. The story of the trio of slave-traders is a fab-&#xD;
rication as absurd as it is base and unfounded. Were&#xD;
it true, I should not have turned aside on my way&#xD;
back to liberty for the purpose of prosecuting Burch.&#xD;
I should have avoided rather than sought him. I&#xD;
should have known that such a step would have re-;&#xD;
sulted in rendering me infamous. Under the circum-&#xD;
stances -longing as I did to behold my family, and&#xD;
elated with the prospect of returning home -it is an&#xD;
outrage upon probability to suppose I would have run&#xD;
the hazard, not only of exposure, but of a criminal&#xD;
&#xD;
f&#xD;
fi&#xD;
&#xD;
prosecution and conviction, by voluntarily placing&#xD;
myself in the position I did, if the statements of&#xD;
Burch and his confederates contain a particle of truth.&#xD;
I took pains to seek him  out, to confront him in a&#xD;
court of law, charging him with the crime of kidnap-&#xD;
ping; and the only motive that impelled me to this&#xD;
'step, was a burning sense of the wrong he had inflict-&#xD;
ed upon me, and a desire to bring him, to justice.&#xD;
He was acquitted, in the manner, and by such means&#xD;
as have been described. A human tribunal has per-&#xD;
mitted him to escape; but there is another and a&#xD;
higher tribunal, where false testimony will not pre-&#xD;
vail, and where I am willing, so far at least as these&#xD;
statements are concerned, to be judged at last.&#xD;
We left Washington on the 20th of January, and&#xD;
proceeding by the way of Philadelphia, New-York,&#xD;
and Albany, reached Sandy Hill in. the night of the&#xD;
21st. My heart overflowed with happiness as I look-&#xD;
ed around upon old familiar scenes, and found niyself&#xD;
in the midst of friends of other days. The following&#xD;
morning I started, in company with several acquaint-&#xD;
ances, for Glens Falls, the Lesidence of Anne and our&#xD;
children.&#xD;
As I entered their comfortable cottage, Margaret&#xD;
was the first that met me. She did not recognize me.&#xD;
When I left her, she was but seven years old, a little&#xD;
prattling girl, playing with her toys. Now she. was&#xD;
grown to womanhood -was married, with a bright-&#xD;
eyed boy standing by her side. Not forgetful of his&#xD;

enslaved, unfortunate grand-father, she had named the&#xD;
child Solomon Northup Staunton. When told who&#xD;
I was, she was overcome with emotion, and unable to&#xD;
speak. Presently Elizabeth entered the room, and&#xD;
Anne came running from the hotel, having been in-&#xD;
formed of my arrival. They embraced me, and with&#xD;
tears flowing down their cheeks, hung upon my neck.&#xD;
But I draw a veil over a scene which can better be&#xD;
imagined than described.&#xD;
When the violence of our emotions had subsided to&#xD;
a sacred joy-when the household gathered round&#xD;
the fire, that sent out its Warm and crackling comfort&#xD;
through the room, we conversed of the thousand&#xD;
'events that had occurred-the hopes and fears, the&#xD;
joys and sorrows, the trials and troubles we had each&#xD;
experienced during the long separation. Alonzo was&#xD;
absent in the western part of the State. The boy&#xD;
had written to his mother a short Jtime previous, of&#xD;
the prospect of his obtaining sufficient money to pur-&#xD;
chase my freedom. From his earliest'years, that had&#xD;
been the chief object of his thoughts and his ambi-&#xD;
tion. They knew I was in bondage. The letter writ-&#xD;
ten on board the brig, and Clem Ray himself, had&#xD;
given them that information. But where I was, until&#xD;
the arrival of Bass' letter, was a matter of conjecture.&#xD;
Elizabeth and Margaret once returned from school&#xD;
so Anne infornied me-weeping bitterly. On inquir-&#xD;
ing the cause of the children's sorrow, it was found&#xD;
that, while studying geography, their attention had&#xD;
been attracted to the picture of slaves working in the&#xD;

MEMORIAL OF ANNE.&#xD;
To His Excellency, the Governor of the State of New-York :&#xD;
The memorial of Anne Northup, of the village of Glens&#xD;
Falls, in the county of Warren, State aforesaid, respectfully&#xD;
sets forth-&#xD;
That your memorialist, whose maiden name was Anne Hamp-&#xD;
ton, was forty-four years old on the 14th day of March last, and&#xD;
was married to Solompon Northup, then of Fort Edward, in&#xD;
the county of Washington and State aforesaid, on the 25th day&#xD;
of December, A. D. 1828, by Timothy Eddy, then a Justice&#xD;
of the Peace. That the said Solomon, after such marriage,&#xD;
lived and kept house with your memorialist in said town until&#xD;
1830, when he removed with his said family to the town of&#xD;
Kingsbury in said county, and remained there about three&#xD;
years, and then removed -to Saratoga' Springs in the State&#xD;
aforesaid, and continued to reside in said Saratoga Springs and&#xD;
the adjoining town until about the year 1841, as near as the&#xD;
time can be recollected, when the said Solomon started to go to&#xD;
the 'city of Washington, in the District of Columbia, since&#xD;
which time your memorialist has never seen her said husband.&#xD;
And your memorialist further states, that in the year 1841&#xD;
she received information by a letter directed to Henry B.&#xD;
Northup, Esq., of Sandy Hill, Washington county, New-York,&#xD;
and post-marked at N'ew-Orleans, that said Solomon had been&#xD;
kidnapped in .Washington, put on board of a vessel, and was&#xD;
then in such vessel in New-Orleans, but could not tell how he&#xD;
came in that situation, nor what his destination was.&#xD;
That your memorialist ever since the last mentioned period&#xD;
has been wholly unable to obtain any information of where the&#xD;
said Solomon was, until the month of September last, when&#xD;

&#xD;
another letter was received from the said Solomon, post-marked&#xD;
- at Marksville, in the parish of Avoyelles, in the State of Lou-&#xD;
isiana, stating that he was held there as a slave, which state-&#xD;
ment your memorialist believes to be true.&#xD;
That the said Solomon is about forty-five years of age, and&#xD;
never resided out of the State of New-York, in which State he&#xD;
was born, until the time he went to Washington city, as before&#xD;

And your memorialist further states that Mintus Northup was&#xD;
the reputed father of said Solomon, and was a negro, and died&#xD;
at Fort Edward, on the 22d day of November, 1829;"that the&#xD;
mother of said Solomon was a mulatto, or three quarters white,&#xD;
and died in the county of Oswego, New-York, some five or six&#xD;
years ago, as your memorialist was informed and believes, and&#xD;
never was a slave.&#xD;
That your memorialist and her family are poor and wholly&#xD;
unable to pay or sustain any portion of the expenses of restor-&#xD;
ing the said Solomon to his freedom.&#xD;
Your excellency is entreated to employ such agentor agents&#xD;
