               <p>THE clock of St. Paul's was sounding eight. Buttoning my outside coat closely
                  about me—for it was a cold, stormy night in November—I descended the steps of the
                  Astor House to visit, in the upper part of the city, the blue-eyed young woman who
                  is looking over my shoulder while I write this. It was nearly twenty years ago,
                  but she is young yet!</p>
               <p>As I closed the outer door, a small voice at my elbow, in a tone broken by sobs,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Sir—will you—please, sir—will you buy some ballads?"</p>
               <p>"Ballads! a little fellow like you selling ballads at this time of night?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; I haven't sold only three all day, sir. Do, please, sir,
                     <emph>do</emph> buy some!" and as he stood under the gas burner which lit the
                  hotel porch, I saw that his face was red with weeping.</p>
               <p>"Come inside, my little man; don't stand here in the cold. Who sends you out on
                  nights like this to sell ballads?"</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6528-00000006"/>
               <p>"Nobody, sir; but mother is sick, and I <emph>have</emph> to sell 'em! She's had
                  nothing to eat all day, sir. Oh! do buy some—<emph>do</emph> buy some, sir!"</p>
               <p>"I will, my good boy. But tell me, have you no father?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir; I never had any; and mother is sick, <emph>very</emph> sick, sir; and
                  she's nobody to do anything for her but me—nobody but <emph>me,</emph> sir!" and
                  he cried as if his very heart would break.</p>
               <p>"Don't cry, my little boy, don't cry. I'll buy your ballads—all of them;" and I
                  gave him two half-dollar pieces—all the silver I had.</p>
               <p>"I haven't got so many as that, sir; I haven't got only twenty, and they're only a
                  cent apiece, sir;" and with very evident reluctance he tendered me back the
                  money.</p>
               <p>"Oh! never mind, my boy; keep the money, and the ballads too."</p>
               <p>"Oh, sir! thank you, sir! Mother will be so glad, sir!" and he turned to go; but
                  his feelings overpowering him, he hid his little face in the big blanket-shawl
                  which he wore, and sobbed louder and harder than before.</p>
               <p>"Where does your mother live, my boy?"</p>
               <p>"Round in Anthony street, sir. Some good folks there give her a room, sir."</p>
               <p>"Did you say she was sick?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; very sick. The doctor says she can't live only a little while,
                  sir."</p>
               <p>"And what will become of you when she is dead?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know, sir. Mother says God will take care of me, sir."</p>
               <p>"Come, my little fellow, don't cry any more. I'll go with you, and see your
                  mother."</p>
               <p>"Oh! thank you, sir. Mother will be so glad to have you—so glad to thank you,
                  sir;" and, looking up timidly in my face, he added: "You'll <emph>love</emph>
                  mother, sir!"</p>
               <p>I took his hand in mine, and we went out into the storm.</p>
               <p>He was not more than seven years old, and had a bright, intelligent, but pale and
                  peaked face. He wore thin, patched trowsers, a small, ragged cap, and large,
                  tattered boots, and over his shoulders was a worn woollen shawl. I could not see
                  the remainder of his clothing, but I afterward discovered that a man's waistcoat
                  was his only other garment.</p>
               <p>As I have said, it was a bleak, stormy night. The rain, which had fallen all the
                  day, froze as it fell, and the sharp wintry wind swept down Broadway, sending an
                  icy chill to my very bones, and making the little hand I held in mine tremble with
                  cold. We passed several blocks in silence, when the child turned into a side
                  street.</p>
               <p>"My little fellow," I said, "this is not Anthony street—that is further on."</p>
               <p>"I know it, sir; but I want to get mother some bread, sir. A good gentleman down
                  here sells it to me very cheap, sir."</p>
               <p>We crossed a couple of streets, and stopped at a corner grocery.</p>
               <p>"Why, my little 'un," said the large, red-faced man behind the counter, "I didn't
                  know what had become of ye! Why haven't ye ben here to-day?"</p>
               <p>"I hadn't any money, sir," replied the little boy.</p>
               <p>"An' haven't ye had any bread to-day, sonny?"</p>
               <p>"Mother hasn't had any, sir. A little bit was left last night, but she made
                     <emph>me</emph> eat that, sir."</p>
               <p>"D—n it, an' hasn't <emph>she</emph> had any all day? Ye mustn't do<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000007"/> that agin, sonny; ye must come, whether ye've money
                  or no. Times is hard, but, I swear, I kin give you a loaf any time."</p>
               <p>"I thank you, sir," I said, advancing from the doorway, where I had stood
                  unobserved; "I will pay you;" and taking a roll of bills from my pocket, I gave
                  him one. "You know what they want; send it to them at once."</p>
               <p>The man stared at me for a moment, then said:</p>
               <p>"Do ye know 'em, sir?"</p>
               <p>"No; I am just going there."</p>
               <p>"Well, do, sir; they're bad off. Ye kin do real good there, no mistake."</p>
               <p>"I'll see," I replied; and taking the bread in one hand, and the little boy by the
                  other, I again started for his mother's. I was always a rapid walker, but I had
                  difficulty in keeping up with the little fellow as he trotted along at my
                  side.</p>
               <p>We soon stopped at the door of an old, weather-worn building, which I saw by the
                  light of the street lamp was of dingy brick, three stories high, and hermetically
                  sealed by green board shutters. It stood but one step above the ground, and a dim
                  light, which came through the low basement windows, showed that even its cellar
                  was occupied. My little guide rang the bell, and in a moment a panel of the door
                  opened, and a shrill voice asked:</p>
               <p>"Who's there?"</p>
               <p>"Only me, ma'am. Please let me in."</p>
               <p>"What! <emph>you,</emph> Franky, out so late as this!" exclaimed the woman,
                  undoing the chain which held the door. As she was about to close it, she caught
                  sight of me, and eying me for a moment, said: "Walk in, sir." As I complied with
                  the invitation, she added, pointing to a room opening from the hall: "Step in
                  there, sir."</p>
               <p>"He's come to see mother, ma'am," said the little boy.</p>
               <p>"You can't see <emph>her,</emph> sir; she's sick, and don't see company any
                  more."</p>
               <p>"I wish to see her for only a moment, madam."</p>
               <p>"But she can't see nobody now, sir."</p>
               <p>"Oh! mother would like to see him very much, ma'am; he's a very good gentleman,
                  ma'am," said the child, in a pleading, winning tone.</p>
               <p>The real object of my visit seemed to break upon the woman, for, making a low
                  courtesy, she said:</p>
               <p>"Oh! she <emph>will</emph> be glad to see you, sir; she's very bad off, very bad
                  indeed," and she led the way at once to the basement stairway.</p>
               <p>The woman was about forty, with a round, full form, a red bloated face, and eyes
                  which looked as if they had not known a wink of sleep for years. She wore a dirty
                  lace cap, trimmed with gaudy colors, and a tawdry red and black dress, laid off in
                  large squares, like the map of Philadelphia. It was very low in the
                  neck—remarkably so for the season—and disclosed a scorched, florid skin, and a
                  rough, mountainous bosom.</p>
               <p>The furnishings of the hall had a shabby-genteel look, till we reached the
                  basement stairs, when everything became bare, and dark, and dirty. The woman led
                  the way down, and opened the door of a front room—the only one on the floor, the
                  rest of the space being occupied as a cellar. The room had a forlorn, cheerless
                  appearance. Its front wall was of naked brick, through which the moisture had
                  crept, dotting it every here and there with large water-stains and blotches of
                  mould; and its other sides were of rough boards, placed up-right, and partially
                  covered with a soiled, ragged paper. Its<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6528-00000008"/>
                  floor was of wide, unpainted plank. A huge chimney stack protruded some three feet
                  into the room, and in it was a hole which admitted the pipe of a rusty air-tight
                  stove, that gave out just enough heat to take the chill edge off the damp, heavy
                  atmosphere. This stove, a small stand resting against the wall, a broken-backed
                  chair, and a low, narrow bed covered with a ragged patchwork counterpane, were the
                  only furniture of the apartment. And that room was the home of two human
                  beings.</p>
               <p>"How do you feel to-night, Fanny?" asked the woman, as she approached the low bed
                  in the corner. There was a reply, but it was too faint for me to hear.</p>
               <p>"Here, mamma," said the little boy, taking me by the hand and leading me to the
                  bedside, "here's a good gentleman, who's come to see you. He's <emph>very</emph>
                  good, mamma; he's given me a whole dollar, and got you lots of things at the
                  store; oh! lots of things!" and the little fellow threw his arms around his
                  mother's neck, and kissed her again and again in his joy.</p>
               <p>The mother turned her eye upon me—such an eye! It seemed a black flame. And her
                  face—so pale, so wan, so woebegone, and yet so wildly, strangely beautiful—seemed
                  that of some fallen angel, who, after long ages of torment, had been purified, and
                  fitted again for heaven! And it was so. She had suffered all the woe, she had wept
                  for all the sin, and then she stood white and pure before the everlasting gates
                  which were opening to let her in!</p>
               <p>She reached me her thin, weak hand, and in a low voice said: "I thank you,
                  sir."</p>
               <p>"You are welcome, madam. You are very sick; it hurts you to speak?"</p>
               <p>She nodded slightly, but said nothing. I turned to the woman who had admitted me,
                  and in a low tone said: "I never saw a person die; is she not dying?"</p>
               <p>"No, sir, I guess not. She's seemed so for a good many days."</p>
               <p>"Has she had a physician?"</p>
               <p>"Not for nigh a month. A doctor come once or twice, but he said it wan't no use—he
                  couldn't help her."</p>
               <p>"But she should have help at once. Have you any one you can send?"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes; I can manage that. What doctor will you have?"</p>
               <p>I wrote on a piece of paper the name of an acquaintance—a skilful and experienced
                  physician, who lived not far off—and gave it to her.</p>
               <p>"And can't you make her a cup of tea, and a little chicken broth? She has had
                  nothing all day."</p>
               <p>"Nothing all day! I'm sure I didn't know it! I'm poor, sir—you don't know how
                  poor—but she shan't starve in my house."</p>
               <p>"I suppose she didn't like to speak of it; but get her something as soon as you
                  can. I'll pay you for your trouble."</p>
               <p>"I don't want any pay, sir," she replied, as she turned and darted from the
                  doorway as nimbly as if she had not been fat and forty.</p>
               <p>She soon returned with the tea and broth, and gave them to the sick girl, a
                  spoonful at a time, she being too weak to sit up. She had tasted nothing of the
                  kind for weeks, and it greatly revived her.</p>
               <p>After a time, the doctor came. He felt her pulse, asked<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000009"/> her a few questions in a low tone, and then wrote
                  some simple directions. When he had done that, he turned to me, and said: "Step
                  outside for a moment; I want to speak with you."</p>
               <p>As we passed out, the woman said to us:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, don't stand in the cold. Walk up into the parlor—the front room."</p>
               <p>We did as she suggested, for the cellar way had a damp, unhealthy air.</p>
               <p>The parlor was furnished in a showy, tawdry style, and a worn, ugly, flame-colored
                  carpet covered its floor. A coal fire was burning in the grate, and we sat down by
                  it. As we did so, I heard loud voices, mingled with laughter and the clinking of
                  glasses, in the adjoining room. Not appearing to notice the noises, the doctor
                  asked:</p>
               <p>"Who is this woman?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know; I never saw her before. Is she dying?"</p>
               <p>"No; not now. But she can't last long; a week, at the most."</p>
               <p>"She is evidently in consumption. That damp cellar has killed her; she should be
                  got out of it."</p>
               <p>"The cellar hasn't done it; her very vitals are eaten up. She's been beyond cure
                  for many months!"</p>
               <p>"Is it possible? And such a woman!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! I see such cases every day—women as fine-looking as she is."</p>
               <p>In a moment he rose to go, saying: "I can do nothing more. But what do you intend
                  to do here?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know what <emph>can</emph> be done. She should not be left to die
                  there."</p>
               <p>"She'd prefer dying above ground, no doubt; and if you relish fleecing, you'll get
                  her an upper room; but she must die soon, and a day or two, more or less, down
                  there, won't make any difference. Take my advice—don't throw your money away, and
                  don't stay here too late; the house has a very hard name, and some of its rough
                  customers would think nothing of throttling a spruce young fellow like you."</p>
               <p>"I thank you, doctor; but I think I'll run the risk—at least for a while," and I
                  laughed good-humoredly at the benevolent gentleman's caution.</p>
               <p>"Well, if you lose your small change, don't charge it to me." Saying this, he bade
                  me "good night."</p>
               <p>He found the door locked, barred, and secured by the large chain, and was obliged
                  to summon the woman. When she had let him out, I asked her into the parlor.</p>
               <p>"Who is this sick person?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>"I don't know, sir. She never gave me no name but Fanny. I found her and her
                  little boy on the doorstep, one night, nigh a month ago. She was crying hard, and
                  seemed very sick, and little Franky was a-trying to comfort her—he's a brave,
                  noble little fellow, sir. She told me she'd been turned out of doors for not
                  paying her rent, and was afeared she'd die in the street, though she didn't seem
                  to care much about that, except for the boy—she took on terrible about him. She
                  didn't know what <emph>would</emph> become of him. I've to scrape very hard to get
                  along, sir, for times is hard; but I couldn't see her die there, so I took her in,
                  and gave her a bed in the basement. 'Twas all I could do; but, poor thing! she
                  won't want even that long."</p>
               <p>"It was very good of you. How has she obtained food?"</p>
               <p>"The little boy sells papers and ballads about the streets.<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000010"/> The newsman round the corner trusts him for 'em,
                  and he's managed to make twenty-five cents or more, 'most every day."</p>
               <p>"Can't you give her another room? She should not die where she is."</p>
               <p>"I know she shouldn't, sir; but I hain't got another—all of 'em is taken up; and
                  besides, sir," and she hesitated a moment, "the noise up here would disturb
                  her."</p>
               <p>I had not thought of that; and expressing myself gratified with her kindness, I
                  passed down again to the basement. The sick girl smiled as I asked:</p>
               <p>"Do you feel better?"</p>
               <p>"Much better," she replied, in a voice stronger than before. "I have not felt so
                  well for a long time. I owe it to you, sir! I am very grateful!"</p>
               <p>"Don't speak of it. Wont you have a little more of the broth?"</p>
               <p>"No more, thank you. I won't trouble you any more, sir. I shan't trouble any one
                  long. But, oh sir! my child! my little boy! What <emph>will</emph> become of him
                  when I'm gone?" and she burst into an hysterical fit of weeping.</p>
               <p>"Don't weep so. Calm yourself; such excitement will kill you. God will take care
                  of your child. I will try to help him."</p>
               <p>She looked at me with those deep, intense eyes. A new light seemed to come into
                  them; it overspread her face, and lit up her thin, wan features, with a strange
                  glow.</p>
               <p>"It must be so," she said; "else why were you led here? God must have sent you to
                  me for that!"</p>
               <p>"No doubt He did. Let it comfort you to think so."</p>
               <p>"It does, oh! it does. And, O my Father!" and she looked up as she spoke: "I thank
                  Thee! Thy poor, sinful, dying child thanks Thee for this!"</p>
               <p>I turned away to hide the emotion I could not repress. After a moment, not seeing
                  the little boy, I asked:</p>
               <p>"Where is your son?"</p>
               <p>"Here, sir;" and turning down the bed-clothing, she showed him sleeping quietly by
                  her side, all unconscious of the misery and the sin around him, and of the crisis
                  through which his young life was passing.</p>
               <p>Saying I would return on the following day, I shortly afterward bade her good
                  night, and left the house.</p>

               <head type="sub">THE DYING MOTHER.</head>
               <p>IT was noon on the following day when I again visited the house in Anthony street.
                  As I opened the door of the sick woman's room, I was startled by her altered
                  appearance. Her eye had a strange, wild light, and her face already wore the
                  pallid hue of death. She was bolstered up in bed, and the little boy was standing
                  by her side, weeping. I took her hand in mine, and in a voice which plainly spoke
                  my fears, said:</p>
               <p>"You are worse!"</p>
               <p>In broken gasps, and in a low, a very low tone, her lips scarcely moving, she
                  answered:</p>
               <p>"No! I am—better—much—better. I knew you—were coming. She told me so."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Who</emph> told you so?" I asked, very kindly, for I saw that her mind was
                  wandering.</p>
               <p>"My mother;—she has been with me—all the day—and I have been so—so happy,
                     so—<emph>very</emph> happy! I am going now—going with her. I've only waited—for
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"Say no more now; you are too weak to talk."</p>
               <p>"But I <emph>must</emph> talk. I am—dying; and I must tell—you all before—I
                  go!"</p>
               <p>"I would gladly hear you, but you have not strength for it now. Let me get
                  something to revive you."</p>
               <p>She nodded assent, and, looking at her son, said:</p>
               <p>"Take Franky."</p>
               <p>The little boy kissed her, and followed me from the room. When we had reached the
                  upper landing, I summoned the woman of the house, and said to him:</p>
               <p>"Now, Franky, I want you to stay here a little while; your mother wishes to talk
                  with me."</p>
               <p>"But mother says she's dying, sir," cried the little fellow, clinging closely to
                  me. "I don't want her to die. Oh! I want to be with her!"</p>
               <p>"You shall be, very soon, my boy; but your <emph>mother</emph> wants you to stay
                  here now."</p>
               <p>He released his hold of my coat, and, sobbing violently, went with the red-faced
                  woman. I hurried back from the apothecary's, and, seating myself on the rickety
                  chair at her bedside, gave the sick one the restorative. She soon revived, and
                  then, in broken sentences, and in a low, weak voice, pausing every now and then to
                  rest or to weep, she told me her story. Weaving it into some details which I
                  gathered from others after her death, I give it to the reader as she outlined it
                  to me.</p>
               <p>She was the only daughter of a well-to-do farmer in the town of B——, in New
                  Hamsphire. Her mother died when she was a child, and left her to the care of a
                  paternal aunt, who became her father's housekeeper. This aunt had a cold, hard
                  nature, and no love for children, but was an exemplary, pious woman. She denied
                  herself every luxury, and would sit up late of nights to braid straw and knit
                  socks, that she might<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC6528-00000012"/> send tracts and
                  hymn books to the poor heathen; but she never gave a word of sympathy, or a look
                  of love, to the young being that was growing up at her side. The little girl
                  needed kindness and affection, as much as plants need the sun; but the good aunt
                  had not these to give her. When the child was six years old, she was sent to the
                  district school. There she met a little boy, not quite five years her senior, and
                  they soon became warm friends. He seemed a brave, manly lad, and she thought no
                  one ever so good or so handsome as he. Her young heart found in him what it craved
                  for—some one to lean on and to love—and she loved him with all the strength of her
                  child-nature. He was very kind to her. Though his home was a mile away, he came
                  every morning to take her to school; and in the long summer vacations he almost
                  lived at her father's house. And thus four years flew away—flew as fast as years
                  that are winged with youth and love always fly; and though her father was harsh,
                  and her aunt cold and stern, she did not know a grief, or shed a tear, in all that
                  time.</p>
               <p>One day, late in summer, toward the close of those four years, John—that was his
                  name—came to her, his face beaming all over with joy, and said:</p>
               <p>"O Fanny! I am going—going to Boston. Father has got me into a great store there—a
                  great store, and I'm to stay till I'm twenty-one. They won't pay me hardly
                  anything—only fifty dollars the first year, and twenty-five more every other year;
                  but father says it's a great store, and it'll be the making of me." And he danced
                  and sang in his joy; but she wept in bitter grief.</p>
               <p>Well, five more years rolled away—they were not winged as before—and John came
                  home to spend his two weeks of summer vacation. He had come every year; but then
                  he said to her what he had never said before—that which a woman never forgets. He
                  told her that the old Quaker gentleman, the head of the great house he was with,
                  had taken a fancy to him, and was going to send him to Europe, in the place of the
                  junior partner, who was sick, and might never get well. That he should stay away a
                  year; but when he came back, he was sure the old fellow would make him a partner,
                  and then—and he strained her to his heart as he said it—"then I will make you my
                  little wife, Fanny, and take you to Boston, and you shall be a fine lady—as fine a
                  lady as Kate Russell, the old man's daughter." And again he danced and sang; and
                  again she wept, but this time it was for joy.</p>
               <p>He stayed away a little more than a year, and when he returned he did not come at
                  once to her, but wrote that he would very soon. In a few days he sent her a
                  newspaper, in which was a marked notice, which read somewhat as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"The co-partnership heretofore existing under the name and style of RUSSELL,
                     ROLLINS &amp; CO., has been dissolved by the death of DAVID GRAY, Jr.</p>
                  <p>"The outstanding affairs will be settled, and the business continued, by the
                     surviving partners, who have this day admitted Mr. JOHN HALLET to an interest
                     in their firm."</p>
               </q>
               <p>The truth had been gradually dawning upon me, yet when she mentioned his name, I
                  involuntarily exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"John Hallet! and were <emph>you</emph> engaged to <emph>him?</emph>"</p>
               <p>The sick woman had paused from exhaustion, but making a feeble effort to raise
                  herself, she said, in a voice stronger than before:</p>
               <p>"Do you know him, sir?"</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6528-00000013"/>
               <p>"Know him? Yes, madam;" and I paused and spoke in a lower tone, for I saw that my
                  manner was unduly exciting her; "I know him well."</p>
               <p>I <emph>did</emph> know him well; and it was on the evening of the day that notice
                  was written, that I, a boy of sixteen, with my hat in my hand, entered the inner
                  office of the counting room of Russell, Rollins &amp; Co. Mr. Russell, a genial,
                  gentle, good old man, was at his desk, writing; and Mr. Rollins sat at his, poring
                  over some long accounts.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Russell and Mr. Rollins," I said very respectfully, "I have come to bid you
                  good-by. I am going to leave you."</p>
               <p>"Thee going to leave!" exclaimed Mr. Russell, laying down his spectacles; "what
                  does thee mean, Edmund?"</p>
               <p>"I mean, I don't want to stay any longer, sir," I replied, my voice trembling.</p>
               <p>"But you <emph>must</emph> stay, Edmund," said Mr. Rollins, in his harsh,
                  imperative way. "Your uncle indentured you to us till you are twenty-one, and you
                  can't go."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>shall</emph> go, sir," I replied, with less respect than he deserved. "My
                  uncle indentured me to the old firm; I am not bound to stay with the new."</p>
               <p>Mr. Russell looked grieved, but in the same mild tone as before, he said:</p>
               <p>"I am sorry, Edmund, very sorry, to hear thee say that. Thee can go, if thee
                  likes; but it grieves me to have thee quibble so. Thee will not prosper, my son,
                  if thee follows this course in life."</p>
               <p>The moisture came into the old man's eyes as he spoke. It filled mine, and rolled
                  in large drops down my cheeks, as I replied:</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, sir, for speaking so. I do not wish to do wrong, but I
                     <emph>can't</emph> stay with John Hallet."</p>
               <p>"Why can't thee stay with John?"</p>
               <p>"He don't like me, sir. We are not friends."</p>
               <p>"Why are you not friends?"</p>
               <p>"Because I know him, sir."</p>
               <p>"What do you know of him?" asked Mr. Rollins, in the same harsh, abrupt tone as
                  before. I had never liked Mr. Rollins, and his words just then stung me to the
                  quick. I forgot myself, for I replied:</p>
               <p>"I know him to be a lying, hypocritical scoundrel, sir."</p>
               <p>Some two years before, Hallet had joined the church in which Mr. Rollins was a
                  deacon, and was universally regarded as a pious, devout young man. The opinion I
                  expressed was, therefore, rank heterodoxy. To my surprise, Mr. Rollins turned to
                  Mr. Russell, and said:</p>
               <p>"I believe the boy is right, Ephraim; John professes too much to be sincere; I've
                  told you so before."</p>
               <p>"I can't think so, Thomas; but it's too late to alter things now. We shall see.
                  Time will prove him."</p>
               <p>I soon left, but not till they had shaken me warmly by the hand, wished me well,
                  and promised me their aid whenever I required it.</p>
               <p>When I had given her some of the cordial, and she had rested awhile, the sick girl
                  resumed her story.</p>
               <p>In about a month, Hallet came. He pictured to her his new position; the wealth and
                  standing it would give him, and he said he was preparing a little home for her,
                  and would soon return and take her with him forever.</p>
               <pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6528-00000014"/>
               <p>[He had then for more than a year been affianced to another—a rich man's only
                  child—a woman older than he, who would have been most repulsive to him, had not
                  money been his god.]</p>
               <p>It is needless to detail by what devilish fraud and artifice this wretch at last
                  achieved the poor girl's ruin.</p>
               <p>About a month afterward, taking up a Boston paper, she saw the marriage of Mr.
                  John Hallet, merchant, to Miss —— ——. "Some other person has his name," she
                  thought. "It cannot be he; yet it is strange." It <emph>was</emph> strange, but it
                  was <emph>true,</emph> for there, in another column, she read that "Mr. John
                  Hallet, of the house of Russell, Rollins &amp; Co., and his accomplished lady,
                  were passengers by the steamer Cambria, which sailed from this port yesterday for
                  Liverpool."</p>
               <p>The blow crushed her. But why need I tell of her grief, her agony, her despair?
                  For months she did not leave her room; and when at last she crawled out into the
                  open air, the nearest neighbors scarcely recognized her.</p>
               <p>It was long, however, before she knew all the wrong that Hallet had done her. Her
                  aunt noticed her altered appearance, and questioned her. She told her all. At
                  first, the cold, hard woman spoke harshly to her; but, though cold and harsh, she
                  had a woman's heart, and she forgave her. She undertook to tell the story to her
                  brother. He had his sister's nature; was a strict, pious, devout man; prayed every
                  morning and evening in his family, and, rain or shine, went every Sunday to hear
                  two dull, cast-iron sermons at the old meeting-house; but he had not her woman's
                  heart. He stormed and raved for a time, and then he cursed his only child, and
                  drove her from his house. The aunt had forty dollars—the proceeds of sock knitting
                  ting and straw braiding, not yet invested in hymn books—and with one sigh for the
                  poor heathen, she gave it to her. With that, and a small satchel of clothes, and
                  with two little hearts beating under her bosom, the poor girl went out into the
                  world. Where could she go? She knew not, but she wandered on till she reached the
                  village. The stage was standing before the tavern door, and the driver was
                  mounting the box to start. She thought for a moment. She could not stay there. It
                  would anger her father if she did; no one would take her in; and besides, she
                  could not meet, in her misery and her shame, those who had known her from
                  childhood. She spoke to the driver. He dismounted, opened the door, and she took a
                  seat in the coach, to go—she did not know whither, she did not care where.</p>
               <p>They rode all night, and in the morning stopped at Concord. As she stepped from
                  the stage, the red-faced landlord asked her if she was going further. She said, "I
                  do not know, sir;" but then a thought struck her. It was five months since Hallet
                  had started for Europe, and it might be that he had returned. She would go to him.
                  Though he could not undo the wrong he had done, he still would aid and pity her.
                  She asked the route to Boston, and, after a light meal, was on the way
                  thither.</p>
               <p>She arrived after dark, and was driven to the Marlboro Hotel—that Eastern Eden for
                  lone women and tobacco-eschewing men—and there she passed the night. Though weak
                  from recent illness, and worn and wearied with the long journey, she could not
                  rest or sleep. The great sorrow that had fallen on her had driven rest from her
                  heart and quiet sleep from her eyelids forever. In the morning she inquired the
                  way to Russell<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6528-00000015"/> sell, Rollins &amp; Co.'s,
                  and after a long search found the grim old warehouse. She started to enter the
                  counting room, but her heart failed her. She turned away, and wandered off through
                  the narrow, crooked streets. She met a busy crowd hurrying to and fro, but no one
                  noticed or cared for her. She saw neat, cheerful homes smiling around her, and she
                  thought how every one had shelter and friends but her. She looked up at the cold,
                  gray sky, and oh! how she longed that it might fall down and bury her forever. And
                  still she wandered, till her limbs grew weary and her heart grew faint. At last
                  she sank down exhausted, and wept—wept as only the lost and the utterly forsaken
                  can weep. Some little boys were playing near, and after a time they left their
                  sports, and came to her. They spoke kindly to her, and it gave her strength. She
                  rose, and walked on again. A hack passed her, and she got into it. After a long
                  hour she stood once more before the old warehouse. It was late in the afternoon,
                  and she had eaten nothing all day, and was very faint and tired; but, summoning
                  all her strength, she at last opened the door of the old counting room.</p>
               <p>A tall, spare, pleasant-faced man was standing at the desk, and she asked him if
                  Mr. John Hallet was there.</p>
               <p>"No, madam; he's in Europe."</p>
               <p>"When will he come back, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Not for a year;" and the man raised his glasses and looked at her.</p>
               <p>Her last hope failed, and with a heavy, crushing pain in her heart, and a dull,
                  dizzy feeling in her head, she turned to go. As she staggered away, a hand was
                  placed gently on her arm, and a mild voice said:</p>
               <p>"Thee is ill; sit down."</p>
               <p>She took the proffered seat, and an old gentleman came out of the inner
                  office.</p>
               <p>"What! what's this, David?" he asked. "What ails the young woman?"</p>
               <p>[She was then not quite seventeen.]</p>
               <p>"She's ill, sir," said David.</p>
               <p>"Only a little tired, sir. I shall be better soon."</p>
               <p>"But thee <emph>is</emph> ill, my child; thee looks so. Come here, Kate!" and the
                  old gentleman raised his voice as if speaking to some one in the inner room. The
                  sick girl lifted her eyes, and saw a blue-eyed, golden-haired young woman, not
                  quite so old as she was.</p>
               <p>"She seems very sick, father. Please, David, get some water;" and the young lady
                  undid the poor girl's bonnet, and bathed her temples with the cool, grateful
                  fluid. After a while the old gentleman asked:</p>
               <p>"What brought thee here, young woman?"</p>
               <p>"I came to see John—Mr. Hallet, I mean, sir."</p>
               <p>"Thee knows John, then?"</p>
               <p>"Oh yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"Where does thee live?"</p>
               <p>She was about to say that she had no home, but, checking herself—for it would seem
                  strange that a young girl who knew John Hallet should be homeless—she
                  answered:</p>
               <p>"In New Hampshire. I live near old Mr. Hallet's, sir. I came to see John, because
                  I've known him ever since I was a child."</p>
               <p>She drank some water, and after a little time rose to leave. As she turned toward
                  the door, the thought of going, with her<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6528-00000016"/>
                  great sorrow, out into the wide, desolate world, crossed her mind, the heavy,
                  crushing pain came again into her heart, the dull, dizzy feeling into her head,
                  the room reeled, and she fell to the floor.</p>
               <p>It was after dark when she came to herself. She was lying on a bed in a large,
                  splendidly furnished apartment, and the same old gentleman and the same young girl
                  were with her. Another old gentleman was there, and as she opened her eyes, he
                  said:</p>
               <p>"She will be better soon; her nervous system has had a severe shock; the
                  difficulty is there. If you could get her to confide in you, 'twould relieve her;
                  it is <emph>hidden</emph> grief that kills people. Come, my child, take this," and
                  he held a fluid to her lips. She drank it, and in a few moments sank into a deep
                  slumber.</p>
               <p>It was late on the following morning when she awoke, and found the young girl
                  still at her bedside.</p>
               <p>"You are better now. A few days of quiet rest will make you well," said the young
                  lady.</p>
               <p>The kind, loving words, almost the first she ever heard from woman, went to her
                  heart, and she wept bitterly as she replied:</p>
               <p>"Oh! no, there is no rest—no more rest for me!"</p>
               <p>"Why so? What is it that grieves you? Tell me. It will ease your pain to let me
                  share it with you."</p>
               <p>She told her, but she withheld his name. Once it rose to her lips, but she thought
                  how those good people would scorn him, how Mr. Russell would cast him off, how his
                  prospects would be blasted, and she kept it back.</p>
               <p>"And that is the reason you went to John? You knew what a good, Christian man he
                  is, and you thought he would aid you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" said the sick girl.</p>
               <p>It was thus she recompensed him for robbing her of home, of honor, and of
                  peace!</p>
               <p>Kate told her father the story, and the good old man gave Fanny a room in one of
                  his tenement houses, and there, a few months later, she gave birth to a little boy
                  and girl. She was very sick, but Kate provided for her wants, procured a nurse,
                  and a physician, and gave her what she needed more than all else—kindness and
                  sympathy.</p>
               <p>Previous to her sickness she had supported herself by her needle, and when she was
                  sufficiently recovered, again had recourse to it. Her earnings were scanty, for
                  she was not strong, but they were eked out by an occasional remittance from her
                  aunt. This good lady still adhered to her sock-knitting, straw-braiding habits,
                  but, to her praise be it spoken, had turned her back resolutely on her benighted
                  brethren and sisters of the Feejee Islands.</p>
               <p>Thus nearly a year wore away, when her little girl sickened and died. She felt a
                  mother's pang at first, but she shed no tears, for she knew it was "well with the
                  child;" that it had gone where it would never know a fate like hers.</p>
               <p>The watching with it, added to her other labors, undermined her health. The
                  remittance from her aunt did not come as usual, and though she paid no rent, she
                  soon found herself unable to earn a support. The Russells had been so good, so
                  kind, had done so much for her, that she could not ask them for more. What, then,
                  should she do? One day, while she was in this strait, Kate came to see her, and
                  casually mentioned<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6528-00000017"/> that John Hallet had
                  returned. She struggled with her pride for a time, but at last made up her mind to
                  apply to him. She wrote to him; told him of her struggles, of her illness, of her
                  many sufferings, of her little boy—his image, his child—then playing at her feet,
                  and she besought him, by the love he bore her in their childhood, not to let his
                  once affianced wife, and his poor, innocent child, STARVE!</p>
               <p>Long weeks went by, but no answer came; and again she wrote him.</p>
               <p>One day, not long after sending this last letter, as she was crossing the Common
                  to her attic in Charles street, she met him. He was alone, and saw her, but
                  attempted to pass her without recognition. She stood squarely in his way, and told
                  him she <emph>would</emph> be heard. He admitted having received her letters, but
                  said he could do nothing for her; that the brat was not <emph>his;</emph> that she
                  must not attempt to fasten on <emph>him</emph> the fruit of her debaucheries; that
                  no one would believe her if she did; and he added, as he turned away, that he was
                  a married man, and a Christian, and could not be seen talking with a lewd
                  woman.</p>
               <p>She was stunned. She sank down on one of the benches near, and tried to weep; but
                  the tears would not come. For the first time since he had so deeply wronged her,
                  she felt a bitter feeling rising in her heart. She rose, and turned her steps up
                  Beacon Hill toward Mr. Russell's, fully determined to tell Kate all. She was
                  admitted, and shown to Miss Russell's room. She told Kate how she had met her
                  seducer, and how he had cast her off.</p>
               <p>"Who is he?" asked Kate. "Tell me, and father will publish him from one end of the
                  universe to the other! He does not deserve to live."</p>
               <p>His name trembled on her tongue. A moment more, and John Hallet had been a ruined
                  man, branded with a mark that would have followed him through the world. But she
                  paused; the vision of his wife, of the innocent child just born to him, rose
                  before her, and the words melted away from her lips unspoken.</p>
               <p>Kate spoke kindly and encouragingly to her, but she heeded her not. One only
                  thought had possession of her: how could she throw off the mighty load that was
                  pressing on her soul?</p>
               <p>After a time, she rose and left the house. As she walked down Beacon street, the
                  sun was sinking in the west, and its red glow mounted midway up the heavens. As
                  she looked at it, the sky seemed one great molten sea, its hot, lurid waves
                  surging all around her. She thought it came nearer; that it set on fire the green
                  Common and the great houses, and shot fierce, hot flames through her brain and
                  into her very soul For a moment she was paralyzed, and sank to the ground; then,
                  springing to her feet, she flew to her child. She bounded down the long hill, and
                  up the steep stairways, and burst into the room of the good woman who was tending
                  him, shouting:</p>
               <p>"Fire! fire! The world is on fire! Run! run! the world is on fire!"</p>
               <p>She caught him up, and darted away. She flew down Charles street, across the
                  Common, and through the crowded thoroughfares, till she reached India Wharf, all
                  the while muttering, "Water, water!"—water, to quench the fire in her blood, in
                  her brain, in her very soul.</p>
               <p>She paused on the pier, and gazed for a moment at the dark, slimy flood; then she
                  plunged down, down, where all is forgetfulness!</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6528-00000018"/>
               <p>She had a dim recollection of a storm at sea; of a vessel thrown violently on its
                  beam ends; of a great tumult, and of voices louder than she ever heard
                  before—voices that rose above the howling of the tempest and the surging of the
                  great waves—calling out: "All hands to clear away the foremast!" But she knew
                  nothing certain. All was chaos.</p>
               <p>The next thing she remembered, was waking one morning in a room about twelve feet
                  square, with a small grated opening in the door. The sun had just risen, and she
                  was lying on a low, narrow bed, whose clothing was spotlessly white and clean. Her
                  little boy was sleeping by her side. His cheeks had a rosier, healthier hue than
                  they ever wore before; and as she turned down the coverlet, she saw he had grown
                  wonderfully. She could hardly credit her senses. Could that be <emph>her</emph>
                  child?</p>
               <p>She spoke to him. He opened his eyes, and smiled, and put his little mouth up to
                  hers, saying, "Kiss, mamma; Kiss Fanky." She took him in her arms, and covered him
                  with kisses. Then she rose to dress herself. A strange but neat and tidy gown was
                  on the chair, and she put it on; it fitted exactly. Franky rolled over to the
                  front of the bed, and putting first one little foot out, and then the other, let
                  himself down to the floor. "Can it be?" she thought; "can he both walk and talk?"
                  Soon she heard the bolt turning in the door. It opened, and a pleasant, elderly
                  woman, with a large bundle of keys at her girdle, entered the room.</p>
               <p>"And how do you do this morning, my daughter?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Very well, ma'am. Where am I?"</p>
               <p>"You ask where? Then you <emph>are</emph> well. You haven't been, for a long, long
                  time, my child."</p>
               <p>"And <emph>where</emph> am I, ma'am?"</p>
               <p>"Why, you are here—at Bloomingdale."</p>
               <p>"How long have I been here?"</p>
               <p>"Let me see; it must be near fifteen months, now."</p>
               <p>"And who brought me here?"</p>
               <p>"A captain of a vessel. He was just hauling out of the dock at Boston, when you
                  jumped into the water with Franky. One of his men sprang overboard, and saved you.
                  The vessel couldn't put back, so he brought you here."</p>
               <p>"Merciful heaven! did I do that?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. You must have been sorely troubled, my child. But never mind; it is all over
                  now. But hasn't Franky grown? Isn't he a handsome boy? Come here to grandma, my
                  baby." The good woman sat down on a chair, and the little fellow ran to her, put
                  his small arms about her neck, and kissed her over and over again. Children are
                  intuitive judges of character; no really bad man or woman ever had the love of a
                  child.</p>
               <p>"Yes, he <emph>has</emph> grown. You call him Franky, do you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; we didn't know his name. What had you named him?"</p>
               <p>"John Hallet."</p>
               <p>As she spoke those words a sharp pang shot through her heart. It was well that her
                  child had another name.</p>
               <p>She was soon sufficiently recovered to leave the asylum. By the kind offices of
                  the matron, she obtained employment in a cap factory, and a plain but comfortable
                  boarding place in the lower part of the city. She worked at the shop, and left
                  Franky during the day with her landlady, a kind-hearted but poor woman. Her
                  earnings were but three dollars a week,<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6528-00000019"/>
                  and their board was two and a quarter; but on the balance she contrived to provide
                  herself and her child with clothes. The only luxury she indulged in was an
                  occasional <emph>walk</emph> on Sunday to Bloomingdale, to see her friend, the
                  good matron.</p>
               <p>Thus things went on for two years; and if not happy, she was at least comfortable.
                  Her father never relented; but her aunt wrote her often, and there was comfort in
                  the thought that at least one of her early friends had not cast her off. That good
                  lady, too, sent her now and then small remittances, but they came few and far
                  between; for as the pious woman grew older, her heart gradually returned to its
                  first love—the poor heathen.</p>
               <p>Before leaving the asylum, she wrote to Kate Russell. She told her of all that had
                  happened as far as she knew, and thanked her for all her goodness and kindness to
                  her. She waited some weeks, but no answer came; and then she wrote again. Still no
                  answer came, though that time she waited two or three months. Fearing that
                  something had befallen Kate, she then mustered courage to write Mr. Russell. Still
                  she got no reply, and she reluctantly concluded—though she had not asked them for
                  aid—that they had ceased to feel interested in her.</p>
               <p>"They had not, madam," I exclaimed. "Kate has often spoken most kindly of you. She
                  wanted to come here to-day; but I did not know this, and I was unwilling to bring
                  her."</p>
               <p>She looked at me with a strange surprise. Her eyes lighted, and her face beamed,
                  as she said: "And you know <emph>her,</emph> too!"</p>
               <p>"Know her? She will soon be my wife."</p>
               <p>"And you will tell her how much I love her—how grateful I am to her?"</p>
               <p>"I will," I replied. I did not say, as I might have said, that Hallet had access
                  to Mr. Russell's mails, at the time she wrote, and, knowing her handwriting, he
                  had undoubtedly intercepted her letters.</p>
               <p>After a long pause, she resumed her story.</p>
               <p>At the end of those two years, a financial panic swept over the country,
                  prostrating the great houses, and sending want and suffering into the attics—not
                  houses, for they have none—of the poor sewing women. The firm that employed her
                  failed, and Fanny was thrown out of work. She went to her friend the matron, and
                  she interested some "benevolent" ladies in her behalf, who gave her shirts to make
                  at twenty-five cents apiece! She could hardly do enough to pay her board; but she
                  could work at home with Franky, and that was a comfort, for he was growing to be a
                  bright, affectionate boy.</p>
               <p>About this time, her aunt and the good matron died. She mourned for them
                  sincerely, for they were all the friends she had.</p>
               <p>The severe times affected her landlady. Being unable to pay her rent, she was sold
                  out by the sheriff, and Fanny had to seek other lodgings. She then took a little
                  room, and lived by herself.</p>
               <p>The death of the matron was a great calamity, for her "benevolent" friends lost
                  interest in her, and soon took from her the poor privilege of making shirts at
                  twenty-five cents apiece! When this befell her, she had but four dollars and
                  twenty cents in the world. This she made furnish food to herself and her child for
                  four long weeks, while she vainly sought<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6528-00000020"/>
                  for work. She offered to do anything—to sew, scrub, cook, wash—anything; but no!
                  there was nothing for her—NOTHING! She must drain the cup to the very dregs, that
                  the vengeance of God—and He would not be just if He did not take terrible
                  vengeance on crime like his—might sink John Hallet to the lowest hell!</p>
               <p>For four days she had not tasted food. Her child was sick. She had
                     <emph>begged</emph> a few crumbs for him, but even <emph>he</emph> had eaten
                  nothing all day. Then the tempter came, and—why need I say it?—she sinned.</p>
               <p>Some months after that, she noticed in the evening paper, among the arrivals at
                  the Astor House, the name of John Hallet. That night she went to him. She was
                  shown to his room, and, rapping at the door, was asked to "walk in." She stepped
                  inside, and stood before him. He sprang from his seat, and told her to leave him.
                  She begged him to hear her—for only one moment to hear her. He stamped on the
                  floor in rage, and told her to go! She did not go, for she showed him the pit of
                  infamy into which she had fallen, and prayed him, as he hoped for heaven, as he
                  loved his own child, to save her! Then, with terrible curses, he opened the door,
                  laid his hands upon her, and—thrust her from the room!</p>
               <p>Why should I tell how, step by step, she went down; how want came upon her; how
                  disease fastened its fangs on her vitals; how Death walked with her up and down
                  Broadway in the gaslight; how, in her very hours of shame, there came to her
                  visions of the innocent past—thoughts of what she <emph>might</emph> have been,
                  and of what she <emph>was?</emph>
               </p>
               <p>As she finished the tale, I rose from my seat, and while tears filled my eyes,
                  said: "Rest easy, my poor girl! As sure as God lives, you shall be avenged. John
                  Hallet shall feel the misery he has brought upon you. I will pull him down—down so
                  low, that the very beggars shall hoot at him in the streets!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! no; do not harm him! Leave him to God. He may yet repent!"</p>
               <p>The long exertion had exhausted her, and she seemed to be sinking rapidly. I felt
                  of her pulse—it scarcely beat; I passed my hand up her arm—it was icy cold to the
                  elbow! She was indeed dying. Giving her some of the cordial, I called her little
                  boy.</p>
               <p>When we entered, she took each of us by the hand, and said to Franky: "My
                  child—your mother is going away—from you. Be a good boy—love this gentleman—he
                  will take care of you!" Then to me she said: "Be kind to him, sir. He is—a good
                  child!"</p>
               <p>"Have comfort, madam; he shall be my son. Kate will be a mother to him!"</p>
               <p>"Bless you! bless her! A mother's blessing will be on you! The blessing of
                  God—will be on you;—and if the dead can come back—to comfort those they love—I
                  will come back—and comfort <emph>you!</emph>"</p>
               <p>I do not know—I cannot know, till the veil which hides her world from ours is
                  lifted from my eyes; but there have been times—many times—when Kate and I have
                  thought she was keeping her word!</p>
               <p>For a half hour she lay without speaking, still holding our hands in hers. Then,
                  in a low tone—so low that I had to bend down to hear—she said:</p>
               <p>"Oh! is it not beautiful! Don't you hear? And look<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000021"/> oh, look! And my mother, too! Oh! it is too bright
                  for such as I!"</p>
               <p>The heavenly gates had opened to her! She had caught a vision of the better
                  land!</p>
               <p>In a moment she said:</p>
               <p>"Farewell, my friend—my child—I will——"Then a low sound rattled in her throat, and
                  she passed away, just as the last rays of the winter sun streamed through the low
                  window. One of its bright beams rested on her face, and lingered there till we
                  laid her away forever.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <head type="sub">A STAGE-COACH ADVENTURE.</head>
               <p>IT was five years after the events recorded in the previous chapter, when, one day
                  late in October, I started on my annual tour among the Southern correspondents of
                  the mercantile house of which I was then a member. Arriving at Richmond shortly
                  after noon, I took a hasty meal at the wretched restaurant near the railway
                  station, and seating myself in one of the rickety cars, proceeded on my journey.
                  As the train moved off from the depot, a hand was placed on my arm, and a familiar
                  voice said:</p>
               <p>"Lord bless me! Kirke, is this you?"</p>
               <p>Looking up, I saw Mr. Robert Preston—or, as he was known among his acquaintance,
                  "Squire Preston of Jones"—a gentleman whose Northern business I had transacted for
                  several years. He had been on a visit to some Virginia relatives, and was
                  returning to his plantation on the Trent, about twenty miles from Newbern. Though
                  I had never been at his home, he had often visited mine, and we were well—in fact,
                  intimately acquainted. I soon explained that I was on the way to New Orleans, and
                  mentioned that I might, on my return, seek the route to his plantation. He urged
                  me to visit it at<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6528-00000022"/> once, and I finally
                  consented to do so. We rode on by the cars as far as Goldsboro, and there, after a
                  few hours' rest, and a light breakfast of corn-cake, hominy, and bacon, took seats
                  on the stage, which then was the only public conveyance to Newbern.</p>
               <p>Preston was an intelligent, cultivated gentleman, and, at that time, appeared to
                  be about thirty-three years of age. He was tall, athletic, and of decidedly
                  prepossessing appearance; and, though somewhat careless in his dress, had a simple
                  dignity about him that is not furnished by the tailor. The firm lines about his
                  mouth, his strong jaw, wide nostrils, and large nose—straight as if cut after a
                  bevel—indicated a resolute, determined character; but his large, dreamy
                  eyes—placed far apart, as if to give fit proportion to his broad, overhanging
                  brows—showed that his nature was as gentle and tender as a woman's. He spoke with
                  the broad Southern accent, and his utterance was usually slow and hesitating, and
                  his manner quiet and deliberate; but I had seen him when his words came like a
                  torrent of hot lava, when his eyes flashed fire, his thin nostrils opened and
                  shut, and his whole frame seemed infused with the power and energy of the steam
                  engine.</p>
               <p>Educated for the ministry, he had been in early life a popular preacher in the
                  Baptist denomination, but at the date of which I am writing, he was devoting
                  himself to the care of his plantation, and preached only now and then, when away
                  from home, or when the little church at Trenton was without a pastor. Altogether
                  he was a man to be remarked upon. A stranger casually meeting him, would turn
                  back, and involuntarily ask: "Who is he?"</p>
               <p>Only five of the nine seats inside the stage were occupied, but as the day, though
                  cold, was clear and pleasant, we mounted the box, and took the vacant places
                  beside the driver. That worthy was a rough, surly character, with a talent for
                  profanity truly wonderful. His horses were lean, half-starved quadrupeds, with
                  ribs protruding from their sides like hoops from a whiskey barrel, and he
                  accounted for their condition, and for the scarcity of fences on the highroad, by
                  saying that the stage owners fed them on rails; but I suspected that the constant
                  curses he discharged at their heads, had worried the flesh off their bones, and
                  induced the fences to move to a less dangerous latitude.</p>
               <p>On the top of the coach, coiled away on a pile of horse blankets, was a woman
                  whose dress and appearance designated her as one of the species of "white trash"
                  known in North Carolina as "clay-eaters." She was about thirty years of age, and,
                  if her skin had been bleached, and her teeth introduced to a scrubbing brush,
                  might have passed for being tolerably good-looking. After a number of preliminary
                  cracks of the whip, and sundry oaths and loud shouts administered to the
                  "leaders," the driver got under way, and we were soon jolting—at a speed of about
                  four miles an hour—over the "slews" and ruts made by the recent rains. Shortly
                  after we started, the woman said to me:</p>
               <p>"I say, stranger, ye han't no 'backer 'bout ye, hev ye?"</p>
               <p>I was about to say I had none, when Preston handed her a paper of "Richmond
                  Sweet." Without pausing to thank him, she coolly stuffed nearly a half of it into
                  her mouth. My companion did not seem at all surprised, but I remarked:</p>
               <p>"You do not <emph>smoke,</emph> then, madam?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! yas, I smokes; but I durned sight d'ruther chaw."</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6528-00000023"/>
               <p>"Let me give you a cigar," I said, taking one from my pocket, and winking at
                  Preston.</p>
               <p>"I never smokes them sort o' things; I takes nat'rally ter pipes—did when I'se a
                  gal," she replied, ejecting a mouthful of saliva of the color of her skin.</p>
               <p>"This gentleman," said the Squire, smiling, "isn't fully up to our ways. He thinks
                  it queer that women chew tobacco."</p>
               <p>"Quar thet wimmin chaws! Han't the' as much right ter as ye? <emph>I</emph> reckon
                  what's good fur th' gander 'll do fur th' goose!"</p>
               <p>"Good logic, that," said Preston, laughing.</p>
               <p>The woman kept on expectorating for a time, when she again spoke to my
                  companion:</p>
               <p>"I say! ye b'long ter Newbern, doan't ye?"</p>
               <p>"No, not now; but I live near there."</p>
               <p>"Ye doan't know a feller down thar called Mulock, I doan't s'pose—Bony
                  Mulock?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do; I know him well."</p>
               <p>"So does I. I'm gwine ter see'im."</p>
               <p>"Where were you acquainted?"</p>
               <p>"Up ter Harnett—I b'long thar—nigh on ter Chalk Level. He war raised thar."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know; but he left there long ago."</p>
               <p>"Nigh on ter nine year. I'm his wife."</p>
               <p>"You his wife!" exclaimed the Squire, turning round and looking at her.</p>
               <p>"Yas. He put eöut nine year ago, and I han't heerd nor seed nary thing on him
                  sence, till a spell back. But I'll stick ter 'im this time, like a possum ter a
                  rail. He woan't put eöut no more, ye kin bet high on thet!"</p>
               <p>"But he has another wife now!"</p>
               <p>"Wall, I thort he moight hev; but she'll <emph>put</emph> kind o' sudden, I
                  reckon. What is she—white or nigger?"</p>
               <p>"She's a likely quadroon girl. She's almost made a man of him."</p>
               <p>"Hi Lordy! then she's right smart. I'm gol-durned ef <emph>I</emph> could!"</p>
               <p>"If you have so poor an opinion of him, why do you follow him?"</p>
               <p>"Wall, I goes for a 'ooman's hevin' har own. When he put eöut, I swore ter gol I'd
                  foller 'im as soon as I got on his trail, ef I hed ter go to h—ll fur it!"</p>
               <p>The low vulgarity of the woman disgusted me, and it seemed to have the same effect
                  on the Squire, for he turned his back to her when she made the last remark. Not
                  appearing to notice his manner, she said, after a moment:</p>
               <p>"I say, Gin'ral! what 'bout thet stealin' bisness?"</p>
               <p>"Bony was taken up a while back, for buying turpentine of the negroes. I reckon
                  he's in jail yet."</p>
               <p>"Yas, I heerd uv thet—thet's how I treed 'im. Cunnel Lamsin—nigh on ter me—he seed
                  it in the paper. I know'd 'im by th' Bonaparty. When'll he be mauled?"</p>
               <p>"Very soon, I reckon. He was sentenced to fifty lashes a week ago."</p>
               <p>"It'll do 'im good; I'd given 'im more'n thet. He war allers up ter dealin' with
                  nigs."</p>
               <p>The road, when we started, was in very bad condition, and as we proceeded it grew
                  gradually worse, till, in the vicinity of the runs where we then were, it had
                  become almost impassable. We frequently turned off into the woods and open
                     fields<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6528-00000024"/> to avoid the worst places, but
                  even there the jolting of the coach was so violent that I momentarily expected our
                  "lady" passenger would roll off into the mud. Seeing that she was in absolute
                  danger, and being also willing to dispense with her refined society, I finally
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Would you not prefer an inside seat?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, I would; but I han't th' money fur't. The' axed so like durnation fur
                  totein' me in thar, I couldn't stan' it, nohow."</p>
               <p>"What fare did she pay, driver?" I asked of the Jehu.</p>
               <p>"Half price."</p>
               <p>"That's enough for seventy miles over a road like this. Let her get inside."</p>
               <p>"Karn't, stranger; 'tan't 'lowed; (d'rot yer dirty hide—you, Jake—g'up!) the old
                  man would raise 'tic'lar (wha 'bout—g'lang, ye lazy critter) music ef I done
                  thet."</p>
               <p>"How much more do you want?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>"The whole figur (g'up thar, g'lang, ye durnation brute); nary a red less."</p>
               <p>"I will see that Dibble finds no fault, and you shall 'moisten up' at the
                  doctor's," said Preston.</p>
               <p>"Wall, Squire (d—n yer rotten pictur), ef ye says thet, (whoa—whoa, thar, ye
                  all-fired rackabones—whoa!) it's a trade."</p>
               <p>The stage halted, and the woman got inside.</p>
               <p>We arrived at Kinston about an hour after noon, and after a meagre meal at "the
                  doctor's" (that gentleman eked out a dull practice among his neighbors by a sharp
                  practice on his guests), again mounted the stage. We had proceeded to within
                  eighteen miles of Newbern, when suddenly, as the Squire and I were lighting our
                  second after-dinner segars, "ker-chunk" went one of the forward wheels, and over
                  went the coach in a twinkling. I saved myself by clinging to the seat, but Preston
                  was not so fortunate. The first I saw of him he was immersed in a pool of water
                  some ten feet distant. Luckily the ground was soft, and he escaped personal
                  injury; but when he rose to his feet, his coat, like Joseph's, was of many colors,
                  a dull clayey-red predominating.</p>
               <p>It was fortunate for the clay-eating feminine that her conversation had disgusted
                  us. Had she remained outside, she might have sighed for her "Bonaparty" in the
                  torrid region of which she had spoken.</p>
               <p>The other passengers escaped with a few bruises, and after an hour's exercise with
                  rails and saplings, we succeeded in prying the wheels out of the mire. Then the
                  driver discovered that one of the horses had lost its shoes, and insisted on
                  having them replaced before proceeding. We were midway between two "relay houses,"
                  and the Jehu decided on taking the shoeless horse back to the station we had
                  passed. As he was unharnessing the animal, I said to him:</p>
               <p>"You say there is a blacksmith at each station—why not go to the one ahead? It
                  will save time."</p>
               <p>"The boy at Tom's store's run off. Thar an't nary a nig thar to hold the critter's
                  huff."</p>
               <p>"Cannot the blacksmith do that himself? I never-heard of its taking two men to
                  shoe one horse!"</p>
               <p>"Wall, it do, stranger. I reckon ye never done thet sort o' bisness."</p>
               <p>"But can't <emph>you</emph> do it?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> do it! My bisness ar drivin' hosses, not shoein' on 'em. When I
                  takes ter thet I'll let ye know!"</p>
               <pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC6528-00000025"/>
               <p>He had by that time taken off the harness, and was preparing to mount the
                  animal.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, my good fellow, do not go back for that. Go on, and <emph>I'll</emph>
                  hold the horse's feet."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Ye</emph> hold 'em! I reckon ye wull! I'd like ter see a man uv yer cloth
                  a-holdin' a critter's fut! Ha! ha!" Then throwing his leg over the horse's bare
                  back, he added: "We doan't come it over trav'lers thet way, in this deestrict—we
                  doan't. We use 'em like folks—we do. Ye can bet yer pile on thet!"</p>
               <p>Preston, who had been quietly enjoying the dialogue, as the driver rode away, said
                  to me:</p>
               <p>"I knew you wouldn't make anything out of him. Come, let us walk on; a little
                  exercise, after our warm work, will do us good."</p>
               <p>Leaving the other passengers to await the motions of the driver, the blacksmith,
                  and the black "huff" holder, we trudged on through the mud, and in about two hours
                  reached the next station.</p>
               <p>The reader will find the spot which bears the dignified cognomen of "Tom's Store,"
                  if he looks on the map of North Carolina. It is there destitute of a name, but is
                  plainly designated by the circular character which is applied by geographers to
                  villages. It is situated on a small tributary of the Neuse, and consists of a
                  one-story building about twenty feet wide, and forty feet long, divided into two
                  apartments, and built of pine slabs. One half of it, at the date of my visit, was
                  sparsely occupied with drygoods, groceries, fishhooks, log chains, goose yokes,
                  tin pans, cut nails, and Jews' harps, while the other was densely crowded with
                  logwood, "dog-leg," strychnine, juniper berries, New England rum, and cistern
                  water, all mixed together. The latter region was the more populous neighborhood,
                  and was absolutely packed with thirsty natives, imbibing certain fluids known at
                  the South as "blue ruin," "bust-head," "red-eye," "tangle-foot," "rifle-whiskey,"
                  and "devil's dye," at the rate of a "bit" a glass, and of four "bits" for "as much
                  as a man could tote."</p>
               <p>I was introduced by the Squire to Tom himself, the illustrious founder of the
                  village. He was a stout, bloated specimen of humanity, with a red, pimpled face, a
                  long grizzly beard, small inflamed eyes, and a nose that might have been mistaken
                  for a peeled beet. His whole appearance showed that he was an <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">habitué</foreign> of the more fashionable quarter of his village
                  (the groggery), and a liberal imbiber of his own compounds. He informed me that he
                  did a "right smart" business; bought drygoods in "York," "sperrets" in 'Hio, and
                  rum in Bostin'; and he added: "Stranger, I never keeps none but th' clar juice,
                  th' raal, genuwine critter, d—d ef I do. Come, take a drink."</p>
               <p>I declined, when a bystander, who seemed to know—he could scarcely keep his
                  feet,—overhearing the remark, confirmed it, by saying with a big oath:</p>
               <p>"It's so, stranger; Tom do keep th' reg'lar critter, th' clar juice! Thar's no
                  mistake 'bout thet, fur it gits tight itself every cold snap!"</p>
               <p>When we arrived, about a hundred men, women, and children were assembled on the
                  cleared plot in front of the store, witnessing a "turkey match." Wishing to avoid
                  the noisy crowd, and being fatigued with our long tramp over the muddy road, my
                  companion and I entered the more reputable portion<pb n="50-51"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000026"/> of the store in quest of a seat. It was nearly
                  deserted. A lazy yellow boy was stretched at full length on the pine counter which
                  kept customers at an honest distance from the rows of half-filled shelves
                  occupying three sides of the room, and on a low bench in front of him sat a woman
                  and two children. These four were the only persons in the apartment. The woman
                  seemed to be not more than twenty-five, and was dressed in a neat calico gown, and
                  had a tidy appearance. She wore a thin woollen shawl, a clean red and yellow
                  turban, white cotton stockings, and coarse untanned shoes. These last were nearly
                  new, and very clumsy, and, like the rest of her costume, were travel-stained and
                  bespattered with mud. She had evidently walked a long distance that morning.</p>
               <p>Her figure was slight and graceful, and her face very beautiful. She had long,
                  black, glossy hair, straight, regular features, a rich olive complexion, and
                  large, lustrous eyes, which, as she sat opposite the open door, were fixed on the
                  thick, gloomy woods, with an earnest, almost agonized gaze, as if she were reading
                  in its tangled depths the dark, uncertain future that lay before her. Never shall
                  I forget the expression of her face. Never have I seen its look of keen, intense
                  agony, and its full, perfect, utter despair. One of the children was a little girl
                  of eight years, with a sweet, hopeful expression, a clear rosy skin, and brown,
                  wavy hair; and the other, a little mulatto boy, a few years older. They each held
                  one of the woman's hands, and something peculiar in their attitudes made me look
                  closely at them. A thin piece of iron, called by slave traders a "bracelet,"
                  encircled their wrists, and fastened their arms to the woman's! They were
                  slaves!</p>
               <p>I entered the cabin a few steps in advance of Preston, who paused in the doorway
                  as he caught sight of the group. The woman did not notice him, but his face turned
                  to a marble white, and his voice trembled with emotion, as he exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"My God! Phyllis, is this <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
               <p>The woman sprang to her feet, took one step forward, and sank to the floor.
                  Stretching out her shackled arms, bound to the children as they were, she clasped
                  his knees, and cried out:</p>
               <p>"Oh Master Robert! dear Master Robert, save me! Oh! save me; for the love of the
                  dear children, save me!"</p>
               <p>The little boy and girl caught hold of his skirts, and both, crying hard, turned
                  their faces up to his. The younger said:</p>
               <p>"Oh! do, massa! take us 'way from dis man; he bery bad, massa. He whip you' little
                  Rosey 'case she couldn't walk all de way—all de way yere, massa!"</p>
               <p>The water gathered in Preston's eyes, as he asked:</p>
               <p>"Why did they sell you, Phyllis? Why didn't I know of it?"</p>
               <p>"Missus went to you, Master Robert, but you warn't to home. Master had to have the
                  money right off. The trader was thar. Master couldn't wait till you come back. Oh!
                  save me, Master Robert! He's takin' me to Orleans, to Orleans! Do save me! Think
                  of the chil'ren, Master Robert. Oh! think of the chil'ren!" and she loosened her
                  hold of his limbs, and wept as if her very heart was breaking.</p>
               <p>Preston's words came thick and broken, his frame shook, he almost groaned, as he
                  said:</p>
               <p>"I would to God that I could, Phyllis; but I am in debt—pressed on every side. I
                  could not raise the money to save my soul!"</p>
               <p>"Oh my God! what will become of us?" exclaimed the<pb n="52-53"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000027"/> woman. "Think of little Lule, Master Robert!
                  They've taken me 'way from her! Oh! what will become of us, Master Robert? what
                  will become of us?"</p>
               <p>Preston stood like a man on whom the sentence of death had fallen. A cold, glassy
                  look came into his eyes, a thick, heavy sweat started from his forehead; his iron
                  limbs seemed giving way under him. Placing my hand on his shoulder, I asked:</p>
               <p>"How much is needed, my friend?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know," he replied, pressing his hands to his head as if to keep it from
                  bursting. "How much, Phylly?"</p>
               <p>"Twelve hundred, Master Robert—they sold us for twelve hundred."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, my good woman, don't feel badly. I'll let Master Robert have the
                  money."</p>
               <p>The woman stared at me incredulously for a moment; then, while the children came
                  and clung to me as if I were an old friend, she said:</p>
               <p>"Oh! bless you, sir! bless you! I will love you, sir! The children will forever
                  love you for it."</p>
               <p>A struggle seemed to be going on in Preston's mind. He was silent for some
                  moments; then, in a slow, undecided voice, he said:</p>
               <p>"It would not be right; I can't take it, Kirke. I owe you now. I'm in debt
                  elsewhere. A judgment has been got against me. My crops have turned out poorly.
                  I've been to Virginia for money, and can't get a dollar. It would not be honest. I
                  can't take it."</p>
               <p>No words can picture the look on the woman's face, as she cried:</p>
               <p>"Oh! do take it, Master Robert! <emph>Do</emph> take it. I'll work. I'll make it.
                  I can make it <emph>very soon,</emph> Master Robert. Oh! <emph>do</emph> take
                  it!"</p>
               <p>"How much is the judgment?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Only six hundred; but old —— has it, and he has no mercy. He'll have the money at
                  once, or sell everything—the negroes—everything!" and he choked down the heavy
                  groan which half escaped his lips.</p>
               <p>"Have you no produce at home?"</p>
               <p>"About a thousand barrels of rosin. But the river is low; I can't get it
                  down."</p>
               <p>"Well, that's worth five hundred dollars where it is. Any cotton?"</p>
               <p>"Only eleven bales—low middling."</p>
               <p>"That's three hundred more. Consider it ours, and draw at ninety days for the
                  whole, judgment and all."</p>
               <p>The woman had risen during this conversation, and stood with her eyes riveted on
                  our faces, as if her eternal destiny hung on our words. When I made the last
                  remark, she staggered toward me and fell, as if dead, at my feet. I brought water
                  from the stream hard by, and we soon restored her to herself. Preston then lifted
                  her from the floor, and placing her tenderly on the bench, said, turning to
                  me:</p>
               <p>"You cannot understand how much you have done for me. Words are weak—they cannot
                  tell you. I will pay you out of the next crop. Meanwhile I will re-draw, and keep
                  it afloat."</p>
               <p>"Do as you like about that. Where is your owner, Phyllis?"</p>
               <p>"Outside, dear master. You'll know him. He's more of us pore creatures with
                  him."</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6528-00000028"/>
               <p>"Come, Preston, let's see him at once; we've no time to lose. The stage will be
                  along soon."</p>
               <p>"I've no heart for trading now. You manage it, my friend."</p>
               <p>"Well, as you say; but you'd better be with me. Come."</p>
               <p>"I will, in a moment."</p>
               <p>He lingered behind, and, when I left the cabin, was speaking in a low tone to the
                  slave woman. Thinking he would follow in a moment, I went in quest of the
                  trader.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE NEGRO TRADER.</head>
               <p>ON the cleared plot in front of the store were assembled, as I have said, about a
                  hundred men, women, and children, witnessing a "turkey match." It was a motley
                  gathering. All classes and colors and ages were there. The young gentleman who
                  boasted his hundred darkies, and the small planter who worked in the field with
                  his five negroes; the "poor trash" who scratched a bare subsistence from a sorry
                  patch of beans and "collards," and the swearing, staggering bully, who did not
                  condescend to do anything; the brawny field hand who had toiled over night to
                  finish his task in time for "de shootin'," and the well-dressed body servant who
                  had roused "young massa oncommon airly" for the same purpose; all, white, black,
                  and yellow—and some neither white, black, nor yellow—were scattered over various
                  parts of the ground, engaged in lounging, playing, drinking, smoking, chatting,
                  swearing, wrangling, and looking on at the turkey match.</p>
               <p>A live turkey was tied to an ordinary bean pole, and, when I emerged from the
                  cabin, seven or eight "natives" had entered for "a shot." The payment of a "bit,"
                  "cash down," to Tom, who officiated as master of ceremonies, secured a chance of
                  hitting the turkey's head with a rifle bullet at "long<pb n="56-57"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000029"/> distance." Any other "hit" was considered "foul,"
                  and passed for nothing. Whoever took the prize, was expected to "treat the crowd."
                  As "the crowd" seemed a thirsty one, it struck me that <emph>turkey</emph> would
                  prove expensive eating to the fortunate shots; but they were oblivious of expense,
                  and in a state of mind that unfitted them for close financial calculations.</p>
               <p>Nearly every marksman present had "carried off his poultry," and Tom already had
                  reaped a harvest of dimes from the whiskey drinking. "Why, bless ye," he said to
                  me, "I should be broke, clean done up, ef it warn't fur the drinks. I haint got
                  more'n a bit, or three fips, fur nary fowl. The fust shot allers brings down the
                  bird; ary man on 'em kin hit a turkey's eye at a hundred paces." This was true;
                  and in such schools were trained the unerring marksmen who are now "bringing down"
                  the bravest youth of our country, like fowls at a turkey match.</p>
               <p>A disturbance had broken out on a remote part of the ground, and, noticing about
                  twenty negro men and women seated on a log near by, I went in that direction, in
                  hopes of meeting the negro trader. It was a dog fight. Inside an imaginary ring
                  about ten feet in diameter, two dogs were clenched in what seemed a life-and-death
                  struggle. One was holding the other down by the lower jaw, while a man, evidently
                  the owner of the half-vanquished brute, was trying to separate them. Outside this
                  ring about twenty other brutes—men, women, and children—were cheering the
                  combatants, and calling on the meddler to desist. It was strange how the
                  peacemaker managed to stand up against the volleys of oaths showered upon him. He
                  did, however, and persisted in his laudable efforts, till a tall, rawboned,
                  heavy-jawed fellow stepped into the ring, and grasped him by the collar, saying:
                  "Let 'em be—it's a fair fight; d—n yer pictur—let 'em alone."</p>
               <p>"Take thet! ye whelp," said the other, planting a heavy blow between the
                  intruder's eyes. Blow followed blow; they clenched; went down; rose up; fought
                  on—at one end of the ring the canines, at the other the fighters; while the rest
                  looked on, shouting, "Let 'er rip! Go in, Wade! Hit 'im agin! Smash his mug! Pluck
                  the grizzly! Hurrah fur Smith! Never say die! Go in agin!" till the blood flowed,
                  and dogs and men rolled over on the ground together.</p>
               <p>Disgusted with this exhibition of nineteenth-century civilization, I turned and
                  walked away. As I did so, I noticed, following me at a short distance, a
                  well-dressed man of about thirty-five. He wore a slouched hat, a gray coat and
                  pantaloons, and enormous high-top boots, to one of which was affixed a brass spur.
                  Over his shoulder, holding the two ends in his hand, he carried a strong, flexible
                  whip, silver mounted, and polished like patent leather. He was about six feet
                  high, stoutly built, with a heavy, inexpressive face, and a clear, sharp gray eye.
                  One glance satisfied me that he was the negro trader.</p>
               <p>As he approached, he held out his hand in a free, hearty way, saying: "Cunnel,
                  good evenin'."</p>
               <p>"Good evenin'," I replied, intentionally adopting his accent; "but yer wrong,
                  stranger; I'm nary cunnel."</p>
               <p>"Well, Major, then?"</p>
               <p>"No, Gin'ral; not even a corp'ral."</p>
               <p>"Then ye're <emph>Squire</emph> ——" and he hesitated for me to fill up the
                  blank.</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6528-00000030"/>
               <p>"No; not even Squire ——," I added, laughing. "I've nary title; I'm plain
                     <emph>Mister</emph> Kirke; nothin' else."</p>
               <p>"Well, <emph>Mister</emph> Kirke, ye're the fust man I've met in the hull Suthun
                  country who was jest nobody at all; and drot me ef I doan't like ye fur't. Ev'ry
                  d—d little upstart, now-a-days, has a handle ter his name—they all b'long ter the
                  nobility, ha! ha!" and he again brought his hand down upon mine with a concussion
                  that made the woods ring.</p>
               <p>"Come," he added, "let's hev a drink."</p>
               <p>"Proud ter drink with ye, stranger; but I karn't go Tom's sperrets; it's hard ter
                  take."</p>
               <p>"Thet's a fact; but I keeps the raal stuff. Thet's the pizen fur ye," he replied,
                  holding up a small willow flask, and starting for the bar. Entering a cloud of
                  tobacco smoke, and groping our way over groups of drunken chivalry, who lay
                  "loosely around," we approached the counter.</p>
               <p>"Har, you lousy sorrel-top," said the trader to the red-faced and red-headed bar
                  tender, "har, give us some mugs."</p>
               <p>"Sorrel-top" placed two glasses on the counter, and my new acquaintance proceeded
                  to rinse them thoroughly. They were of a clear grass-green color, and holding one
                  up to the light, the trader said: "Now luk a' them. Them's 'bout as green as the
                  fellers thet drink out on 'em. A man's stumac's got ter be of cast iron ter stand
                  the stuff they sell yere."</p>
               <p>"It's better'n you kin 'ford ter drink," exclaimed the bar-tender, in high
                  dudgeon.</p>
               <p>"Who spoke ter ye?—take thet!" rejoined the trader, discharging the contents of
                  the glass full in the man's face. The sorrel-crowned worthy bore the indignity
                  silently, evidently deeming discretion the better part of valor</p>
               <p>"Buy'n ony nigs, Kirke?" said the trader, inserting his arm in mine, and leading
                  me away from the shanty. "I've got a prime lot—<emph>prime!</emph>" and he smacked
                  his lips at the last word, in the manner that is common to professional liquor
                  tasters. He scented a trade afar off, and his organs of taste, sympathizing with
                  his olfactories, gave out that token of satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"Well, I doan't know. What ye got?"</p>
               <p>"Some o' the likeliest property ye ever seed—men and wimmin. All bought round har;
                  haint ben ter Virginny yit. Come 'long, I'll show ye;" and he proceeded toward the
                  group of chattels. He was becoming altogether too familiar; but I called to mind a
                  favorite maxim of good old Mr. Russell—"Necessity has no law"—and quietly
                  submitted.</p>
               <p>The negroes were seated on a fallen pine, and were chained together by the wrists,
                  in gangs of four or five, the outside one having one hand secured by a cord bound
                  about the waist. The men wore woollen hats, and the women neat Madras turbans, and
                  both had thick linsey clothing, warm enough for any weather. Their dusky faces
                  were sleek and oily, and their kinky locks combed as straight as nature would
                  permit. The trader had "rigged them up," as a jockey "rigs up" horses for
                  market.</p>
               <p>Pausing before a brawny specimen of the yellow species, he said: "Thar, Kirke, luk
                  o' thar; thar's a boy fur ye—a nig thet kin work; 'tend ten thousand boxes
                  (turpentine) easy. He's the sort. Prime stuff, <emph>thet</emph> (feeling of his
                  arms and thighs); hard—hard as rock—siners like rope. Come o' good stock, he
                  did—the old Devereaux blood (a highly respectable family in those parts); they's
                  the raal quality—none on yer<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6528-00000031"/> shams and
                  mushrooms, but genuwine 'stockracy—blamed ef they haint. What d'ye say ter
                  him?"</p>
               <p>"Well, he moight do, p'raps; but I rather reckon ye've done him up some—'iled his
                  face, greased his wool, and sech like. It's all right, ye knows—onything's far in
                  trade; but ye karn't come it over me, ole feller. I'm up ter sech doin's. I
                     <emph>am,</emph> Mr. ——," and I paused for him to finish the sentence.</p>
               <p>"Larkin," he added quickly and good-humoredly; "Jake Larkin, and yours, by——," and
                  he gave my hand another shake. "Yer one on 'em, I swar, and I own up; I
                     <emph>hev</emph> 'iled 'em a trifle—jest a trifle; but ye kin see through thet.
                  We hev ter do it ter fix the green 'uns, ye knows."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I knows—'iled 'em inside and out, haint ye?"</p>
               <p>"No, on my soul; only one glass ter day—true as preachin'."</p>
               <p>"Boy," I said to the yellow man, "how much whiskey hev ye drunk ter day? Now, tell
                  the truth."</p>
               <p>"Nary drop, massa; hed a moufful o' <emph>sperrets</emph>—a berry little moufful;
                  dat's all."</p>
               <p>"'Taint 'nough, Larkin! Come, now, doan't be mean with nigs. Give 'em some
                  more—some o' thet tall brandy o' yourn; a good swig. They karn't stand it out yere
                  in the cold without a little warmin' up."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'm blamed ef I won't. Har, you, Jim," speaking to a well-dressed darky
                  lounging near; "har, go ter thet red-headed woodpecker, thar at the cabin, and
                  tell him I'll smash his peepers ef he doan't send me some glasses ter onst—d'ye
                  yere? Go."</p>
               <p>The gentlemanly darky went, and soon returned with the glass-ware; and meanwhile
                  Larkin directed another well-clad negro man to "fotch the jugs." They were strung
                  across the back of a horse which was tied near, and, uncorking one of them, the
                  trader said: "I allers tote my own pizen. 'Taint right to give even nigs sech
                  hell-fire as they sell round har; it gits a feller's stumac used ter Tophet 'fore
                  the rest on him is 'climated."</p>
               <p>"Well, it does," I replied; "it's the devil's own warmin' pan."</p>
               <p>Each negro received a fair quantity of the beverage, and seemed the better for it.
                  A little brandy, "for the stomach's sake," is enjoyed by those dusky denizens of
                  the low latitudes.</p>
               <p>When they were all supplied, the trader said to me: "Now, what d'ye say, Kirke?
                  What'll ye give fur the boy?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I reckon I doan't want no boy now; and I doan't know as I wants ary 'ooman
                  nother; but if ye've got a right likely gal—one thet'll sew, and nuss good—I
                  moight buy har fur a friend o' mine. His wife's hed twins, and he moight use har
                  ter look arter the young 'uns."</p>
               <p>"Young or old?"</p>
               <p>"Young and sprightly."</p>
               <p>"They is high, ye knows; but thar's a gal thet'll suit. Git up, gals;" and a row
                  of five women rose. "No; git up thar, whar we kin see ye." They stepped up on the
                  log. "Now, thar's a gal fur ye," he continued, pointing to a clean, tidy mulatto
                  woman, not more than nineteen, with a handsome but meek, sorrow-marked face. "Luk
                  at thet!" and he threw up her dress to her knees, while the poor girl reached down
                  her shackled hands in the vain effort to prevent the indignity. He<pb n="62-63"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000032"/> was about to show off other good points, when I
                  said: "Never mind; I see what she is. Let 'em git down."</p>
               <p>They resumed their seats, and he continued: "Thet's jest the gal ye wants, Kirke.
                  Good at nussin', wet or dry. Good at breedin', too; hed two young 'uns a'ready. Ye
                  kin *' * * * *." (The rest of this discourse will not bear repeating.)</p>
               <p>"No, thank you."</p>
               <p>"Well, jest as ye say. She's sound, though; sold fur no fault. Har young massa's
                  ben a-usin' on har—young 'uns are his'n. Old man got pious; couldn't stand sech
                  doin's, no-how—ter home; so he says ter me, 'Jake,' says he, 'take har ter
                  Orleans; she's jest the sort; ye'll make money sellin' har ter some o' them young
                  bloods.' Ha! ha! thet's religion fur ye! I doan't know, Kirke, mebbe ye b'long ter
                  the church, and p'raps ye're one o' the screamin' sort; but onyhow, I say, d—n
                  sech religion as thet. Jake Larkin's a spec'lator, but he wouldn't do a thing like
                  thet; ef he would, d—n him."</p>
               <p>(The dealer in negroes never applies the term "trader" to himself; he prefers the
                  softer word, "speculator." The phrase "negro trader," is used only by the rest of
                  the community, who are "holier than he.")</p>
               <p>"I doan't b'lieve ye would, Larkin; yer a good feller, at bottom, I reckon."</p>
               <p>"Well, Kirke, ye're a trump. Come, hev another drink."</p>
               <p>"No; excuse me; karn't stand more'n one horn a day: another'd lay me out flatter'n
                  a stewpan. But ter business. How much fur thet gal—cash down? Come, talk it
                  out."</p>
               <p>"Well, at a word—twelve hun'red."</p>
               <p>"Too much—bigger'n my pile; couldn't put so much inter one gal, nohow. Wouldn't
                  give thet money fur ary nig in Car'lina."</p>
               <p>"Oh, buy me, good massa. Mister Larkin'll take less'n dat, I reckon;
                     <emph>do</emph> buy me," cried the girl, who had been eying me very closely
                  during the preceding dialogue.</p>
               <p>"I would, my good girl, if I could; but you'll not exactly suit my friend."</p>
               <p>"Buy har fur yourself, then, Kire. She'll suit you. She's sound, I tell ye; ye'd
                  make money on har."</p>
               <p>"Not much, I reckon," I replied, dryly.</p>
               <p>"Why not? She'll breed like a rabbit. * * * * *."</p>
               <p>"I wouldn't own her for the whole State. If I had her, I'd free her on the spot!"
                  The cool bestiality of the trader disgusted me, and I forgot myself.</p>
               <p>He started back surprised, then quietly remarked: "Ye're a Nuthuner, I swar; no
                  corncracker ever held sech doctrines as them."</p>
               <p>"Yes," I replied, dropping the accent which my blunder had rendered useless; "I
                     <emph>am</emph> a Northerner; but I want a nurse, notwithstanding, for a
                  friend."</p>
               <p>"Whar d'ye live?" asked the trader, in the same free, good-natured tone as
                  before.</p>
               <p>"In New York."</p>
               <p>"In York! What! yer not Mr. Kirke, of Randall, Kirke &amp; Co.? But, blamenation,
                  ye <emph>ar!</emph> How them whiskers has altered ye! I <emph>thort</emph> I'd
                  seed ye afore. Haint ye come it over me slick? Tuk in clean—swollered whole. But
                  thar's my hand, Mr. Kirke; I'm right glad ter see ye."</p>
               <p>"Where have you met me, my good fellow? I don't remember you."</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6528-00000033"/>
               <p>"Down ter Orleans. Seed ye inter Roye, Struthers &amp; Co.'s. The ole man thinks a
                  heap o' you. Ye give 'em a pile o' business, doan't ye?"</p>
               <p>"No; not much of our own. They buy cotton for our English correspondents, and
                  negotiate through us; that is all. Roye is a fine old gentleman."</p>
               <p>"Yes, he ar; I'm in with him."</p>
               <p>"How <emph>in</emph> with him?"</p>
               <p>"Why, in this business. We go snacks; I does the buyin', and he finds the rocks.
                  We use a pile—sometimes a hun'red, sometimes two hun'red thousand."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible! Then you do a large business?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, right smart. I handle 'bout a thousand, big and little, ev'ry year."</p>
               <p>"That <emph>is</emph> large. You do not buy and sell them all, yourself, do
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! no; I hardly ever sells. Once in a while I run agin a buyer, <emph>like
                     you</emph>—ha! ha!—and let one drap; but gin'rally I cage 'em; and when I git
                  'bout a hun'red together, take 'em ter Orleans, and auction 'em off. Thar's no
                  fuss and dicker 'bout thet, ye knows."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know. But how do you manage so large a gang? I should think some would get
                  away."</p>
               <p>"No, they doan't. I put the ribands on 'em; and, 'sides, ye see them boys, thar?"
                  pointing to three splendid specimens of property, loitering near; "I've hed them
                  boys nigh on ter ten year, and I haint lost nary nig sence I had 'em. They're
                  cuter and smarter nor I ar, ony day."</p>
               <p>"Then you pick the negroes up round the country, and send them to a rendezvous,
                  where you put them in jail till you make up your number?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I'm pickin' some up round yere, now, ye see, and takin' 'em ter Goldsboro'.
                  When I've toted 'em down thar, the boys and I'll go up ter Virginny."</p>
               <p>"Why don't you send them on by stage? I should think it would hurt them to camp
                  out at this season."</p>
               <p>"Hurt 'em! Lord bless ye, fresh air never hurt a nig. They're never so happy as
                  sleepin' on the groun', with nothin' over 'em, and thar heels close ter a
                  light-wood fire."</p>
               <p>"But the delicate house-women, and the children—can they bear it?"</p>
               <p>"It do come a trifle hard on them, but it doan't last long. I allers takes ter the
                  railroad when I gits a gang together."</p>
               <p>"Well, come; I want a woman. Show me all you have."</p>
               <p>"Do you mean so, raally, Mr. Kirke? I thort ye wus a comin' it on me; and I swar
                  ye does do the Suthun like a native. I'm blamed ef I didn't s'pose ye b'longed
                  round yere. Ha! ha! How the ole man would larf ter hear it!"</p>
               <p>"But I <emph>am</emph> a native, Larkin; born within sight of Bunker Hill."</p>
               <p>"Yes, thet kind o' native; and them's the sort, too. They make all-fired smart
                  spec'lators. I knows a dozen on 'em, thet hev made thar pile, and haint older'n I
                  ar, nother."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible!—Yankees in this business?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, lots on 'em. Some on yer big folks up ter York and Bostin are in it deep;
                  but they go the 'portin' line, gin'rally, and <emph>thet</emph>——d—d ef

               <p>"Well, about the woman. None of these will do; are they all you have?"</p>
               <p>"No; I've got one more, but I've sort o' 'lotted har ter a young feller down ter
                  Orleans. He axed me ter git him jest<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6528-00000034"/> sech
                  a gal. She's 'most white, and brought up tender like; and them kind is high
                  prized, ye knows."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know; but where is she? Let me see her."</p>
               <p>"She's in the store;" and, rising, he led the way to the shanty.</p>
               <p>When we arrived at the part of the ground where the marksmen were stationed, we
                  found an altercation going on between Tom and a young planter. It appeared that
                  the young man had paid for a shot, and insisted on his body servant taking his
                  place in the lists. To that Tom, and the stout yeomen who had entered for the
                  turkey, objected, on account of the yellow man's station and complexion.</p>
               <p>The young gentleman was dressed in the highest style of fashion, and, though not
                  more than nineteen, was evidently a "blood" of "the very first water." The body
                  servant was a good-looking quadroon, and sported an enormous diamond pin and a
                  heavy gold watch-chain. In his sleek beaver hat, and nicely-brushed suit of black
                  broadcloth, he appeared more like a gentleman than any one on the ground.</p>
               <p>As we approached, Tom—every pimple on his red face swelling with virtuous
                  indignation—was delivering himself of the following harangue:</p>
               <p>"We doan't put ourselfs on a futtin' with darkies, Mr. Gaston. We doan't keer if
                  they does b'long ter kid-gloved 'ristocrats like ye is; they karn't come in har,
                  nohow! Ye'd better go home. Ye orter be in better business then prowlin' round
                  shootin' matches, with yer scented, bedevilled-up buck niggers. Go home, and wash
                  the scent out o' yer cloes. Yer d—d muskmelon" (Tom's word for musk) "makes ye
                  smell jest like hurt skunks; and ye ar skunks, clar through ter the innards. Whew!
                  Clar out, I tell ye!"</p>
               <p>The young man's face reddened. The blood of the chivalry was rising, and he
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"Keep a civil tongue in your head, you thieving scoundrel. If you don't, the next
                  time I catch you trading with my nigs, I'll see you get a hundred lashes; d—d if I
                  don't."</p>
               <p>Tom bade him go to a very warm latitude, and denied trading with negroes.</p>
               <p>"You lie, you sneaking whelp. You've got the marks on your back now, for dealing
                  with Pritchett's."</p>
               <p>Tom returned the lie, when the young man's face grew a trifle redder, and his whip
                  rising in the air, it fell across Tom's nose in a very uncomfortable manner—for
                  Tom. The liquor vender reeled, but, recovering himself in a moment, he aimed a
                  heavy blow at the young gentleman's frontispiece. That "parlor ornament" would
                  have been sadly disfigured, had not the darky caught the stroke on his left arm,
                  and at the same moment planted what the "profession" call a "wiper," just behind
                  Tom's left ear. Tom's private dram shop went down—"caved in"—was "laid out
                  sprawlin';" and two or three minutes elapsed before it got on its legs again. When
                  it did, it frothed at the mouth like a mug of ale with too much head on it.</p>
               <p>They were not more than six paces apart when Tom rose. Drawing a double-barrelled
                  pistol from his pocket, he aimed it at the planter. The latter was in readiness
                  for him. His six-shooter was level with Tom's breast, and his hand on the trigger,
                  when, just as he was about to fire, the negro trader coolly stepped before him,
                  and twisted the weapon from his hand. Turning to Tom, Larkin then said: "Now, you
                  clar! Make tracks, or I'll lamm ye like blamenation. Be off, I tell ye!" he added,
                  as Tom showed an unwillingness to move. "A sensible<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000035"/> sible man like ye arn't a gwine ter waste good
                  powder on sech a muskrat sort of a thing as this is, is ye? Come, clar!" and
                  placing his hand on Tom's shoulder, he accelerated his rather slow movements
                  toward the groggery. Returning then to the young man, he said:</p>
               <p>"And now you, Mr. Gustavus Adolphus Pocahontas Pow hatan Gaston, s'pose
                     <emph>you</emph> clar out, too?"</p>
               <p>"I shall go when I please—not before," said Mr. Gaston.</p>
               <p>"You'll please mighty sudden, then, <emph>I</emph> reckon. A young man o' your
                  edication should be 'bout better business than gittin' inter brawls with low
                  groggery keepers, and 'sultin' decent white folks with your scented-up niggers.
                  Yer a disgrace ter yer good ole father, and them as wus afore him. With yer
                  larnin' and money ye moight be doin' suthin' fur them as is below ye; but yer
                  doin' nothin' but hangin' round bar rooms, gittin' drunk, playin' cards, drivin'
                  fast hosses, and keepin' nigger wimmin. I'm ashamed o' ye. Yer gwine straight ter
                  hell, ye is; and the hull country's gwine thar, too, 'cause it's raisin' a crap of
                  jest sech idle, no-account, blusterin', riproarin' young fools as you is. Now, go
                  home. Make tracks ter onst, or I'll hev thet d—d nigger's neck o' your'n stretched
                  fur strikin' a white man, I will! Ye knows me, and I'll do it, as sure's my name's
                  Jake Larkin."</p>
               <p>The young planter listened rather impatiently to this harangue, but said nothing.
                  When it was concluded, he told his servant to bring up the horses; and then,
                  turning to the trader, said:</p>
               <p>"Well, Right Reverend Mr. Larkin, you'll please to make yourself scarce around the
                  plantation in future. If you come near it, just remember that we keep
                     <emph>dogs,</emph> and that we use them for chasing—<emph>niggers.</emph>" The
                  last word was emphasized in a way that showed he classed Larkin with the wares he
                  dealt in.</p>
               <p>"Yer father, young man, is a honest man, and a gentleman. He knows I'm one, if I
                     <emph>does</emph> trade in niggers. He'll want ter see me when I want ter
                  come."</p>
               <p>The negro by this time had brought up the horses. "Good evening, Mr. Larkin," said
                  young Hopeful, as he mounted and rode off.</p>
               <p>"Good evenin'," replied the trader, coolly, but respectfully.</p>
               <p>"Good evenin', <emph>Mister</emph> Larkin," said the gentleman's gentleman, as he
                  also mounted to ride off. The emphasis on the "Mister" was too much for the
                  trader, and, making one spring toward the darky, he laid his stout whip across his
                  face. The scented ebony roared, and just then his horse, a high-blooded animal,
                  reared, and threw him. When he had gathered himself up, several warm applications
                  of a thick boot were made to the inexpressible part of his person, and, roaring
                  with pain, he made off at a gait faster than that of his runaway horse.</p>
               <p>During the affray the occupants of the ground gathered around the belligerents;
                  but as soon as it was over, they went quietly back to "old-sledge," "seven-up,"
                  "pitch-and-toss," "chuck-a-luck," and the "turkey match."</p>
               <p>As we walked toward the shanty, the trader said: "Thet feller's a fool. What a
                  chance he's throwin' away! He arn't of no more use than a rotten coon skin or a
                  spoilt herrin', he arn't. All on our young bucks is jest like him. The country's
                  goin' ter the devil, shore;" and, with this choice bit of moralizing, he entered
                  the cabin.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <head type="sub">A SLAVE SALE.</head>
               <p>THE Squire was pacing to and fro in the upper end of the room, and the woman and
                  children were seated on the low bench near the counter. Phyllis lifted her eyes to
                  my face as I entered, with a hopeful, inquiring expression, but they fell again
                  when the trader said: "Thet's the gal fur ye, Mr. Kirke; the most perfectest gal
                  in seven States; good at onything—washin', ironin', nussin', breedin'; rig'larly
                  fotched up; worth her weight in gold, d—d if she haint." Turning then to Preston,
                  he exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Why, Squire, how ar ye?"</p>
               <p>"Very well," replied my friend, coolly.</p>
               <p>"How's times?" continued the trader.</p>
               <p>"Very well," said Preston, in a tone which showed a decided distaste for
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>"Well, glad on it. I heerd ye were hard put. Glad on it, Squire."</p>
               <p>The Squire took no further notice of him; and, turning to his property, the trader
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Stand up, gal, and let me show what yer made of. Doan't look so down in the
                  mouth, gal; this gentleman's got a friend thet'll keep ye in the style ye's
                  fotched up ter."</p>
               <p>Phyllis rose, and made a strong effort to appear composed.</p>
               <p>"Now, Mr. Kirke, luk at thet rig," said Larkin, seizing her rudely by the arm, and
                  turning her half around; "straight's a rail. Luk at thet ankle and fut—nimble's a
                  squirrel; and healthy! why, ye couldn't sicken har if ye put har ter hosspetal
                  work."</p>
               <p>"Well, never mind; I see what she is. What's your price?"</p>
               <p>"But ye haint seed har yit! She's puny like, I knows, but she's solid,
                     <emph>I</emph> reckon; thar haint a pound o' loose stuff on har—it's all
                  muscle. See thar—jest look o' thet," and he stripped the sleeve of her dress to
                  the elbow; "thar's a arm fur ye—whiter'n buttermilk, and harder'n cheese. Feel
                  on't."</p>
               <p>The poor woman submitted meekly to this rough handling of her person, but I said,
                  impatiently:</p>
               <p>"I tell you, Larkin, I'm satisfied. Name your price. I've no time to lose: the
                  stage will be along in five minutes."</p>
               <p>"The stage! Lord bless ye, Mr. Kirke, it's broke down; 'twon't be here fur an
                  hour, I knows. Now luk o' thet," he continued, drawing the poor woman's thin dress
                  tightly across her limbs, while he proceeded, despite my repeated attempts to
                  interrupt him, with his disgusting exhibitions, which it would be disgraceful even
                  to describe. "Ye doan't mind, do ye, gal?" he added, chucking her under the chin
                  in a rude, familiar way, and giving a brutal laugh. Phyllis shrank away from him,
                  but made no reply. She had evidently braced her mind to the ordeal, and was
                  prepared to bear anything, rather than offend him. I determined to stop any
                  further proceeding, and said to him:</p>
               <pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6528-00000037"/>
               <p>"I tell you, Larkin, I'm satisfied. I cannot waste my time in this manner. Let's
                  have your price.</p>
               <p>"Time, Mr. Kirke! Why, yer time arn't worth nothin' jest now. The stage won't be
                  'long 'fore dark. Ye haint seed half on har yit. I doan't want ter sell ye a
                  damaged article. I want ter show ye she's sound's a nut—<emph>ye won't pay my
                     price ef I doan't.</emph> Look a thar, now," and with a quick, dexterous
                  movement, he tore open the front of her dress. * * * *</p>
               <p>The poor girl, unable to use her hands, bent over nearly double, and strained the
                  children to her breast to hide her shame. A movement at the other end of the room
                  made me look at the Squire. With his jaws set, his hands clenched, and his face on
                  fire, he was striding toward the trader. In a moment he would have been upon him.
                  My own blood boiled, but, knowing that an outbreak would be fatal to our purpose,
                  I planted myself firmly in his way, and said, as I took him by the arm, and held
                  him back by main force:</p>
               <p>"Be quiet, Preston; this is my affair."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Squire," added the trader, "ye'd better be quiet. Ye'll turn trader yerself,
                  yit. If things is true, ye'll hev ter begin on yer own nigs, mighty sudden."</p>
               <p>"If I am brought to that," replied the Squire, with the calm dignity which was
                  natural to him, "I shall treat them like human beings—not like brutes."</p>
               <p>"Ye'll show 'em off the best how ye kin; let ye alone fur thet. I know yer whole
                  parson tribe; thar haint nary a honest one among ye."</p>
               <p>Preston turned silently away, as if disdaining to waste words on such a subject;
                  and I said to the trader:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Larkin, I've told you I've no time to lose. Name your price at once, or I'll
                  not buy the woman at all."</p>
               <p>"Wall, jest as ye say, Mr. Kirke. But ye see she's a rare 'un—would bring two
                  thousand in Orleans, sures a gun."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! you know better than that. But name your price."</p>
               <p>"What, fur the lot, or the 'ooman alone?"</p>
               <p>"Either way. I've no particular use for the children, but I'll buy them, if
                  cheap."</p>
               <p>"Oh! <emph>do</emph> buy us," cried the little girl, taking hold of my coat; "do
                  buy us—please do, good massa."</p>
               <p>"Shet up, ye young whelp," said the trader, raising his whip. The little thing
                  slunk back affrighted, and began to sob, but said no more.</p>
               <p>"Wall, Mr. Kirke, the lot cost me sixteen fifty, hard rocks; and 'twus dirt cheap,
                  'cause the 'ooman alone'll bring more'n thet. I couldn't hev bought har fur thet,
                  but har owner wus hard up. Ye see, he's Gineral ——, down ter Newbern, one on yer
                  reg'lar 'ristocrats, the raal ole-fashioned sort—keeps big plantation, house in
                  town; fine wines; fine wimmen; fast hosses; and goes it mighty strong. Well, he's
                  allers a trifle under—ev'ry year 'bout two thousand short; and ev'ry year I buy a
                  couple or so of nigs on him ter make it up. Wall, when I gits 'long thar t'other
                  day, he says ter me, says he: 'Lark' (he allers calls me Lark; thet's the name I
                  goes by 'mong my intimate 'quaintance. He's a pertickerler friend o' mine, ye see;
                  he thinks a heap o' me, he does); well, says he, 'Lark, thar's Phylly; I want ye
                  ter take har. She's the likeliest gal in the world—good ole Virginny blood, father
                  one of the raal ole stock. Ye knows she's right—right ev'ry way; prays like a camp
                  meetin', and virtuous ter kill; thar ain't none round har thet's up ter har at
                  thet; tried ter cum round<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6528-00000038"/> har myself, but
                  couldn't git nigher'n a rod—won't hev but one man, and'll stick ter him like
                  death; jest the sort fur one o' them New Orleans bloods as wants a gal thet'll be
                  true ter 'em. Does ye take, Lark?' says he. 'Well, I does,' says I; 'and I knows
                  jest the feller fur har—one o' year raal highflyers; rich's a Jew—twenty thousand
                  a year; lives like a prince; got one or two on 'em now; but he says ter me, when I
                  comes off, 'Lark,' says he, 'find me a gal, kinder pale, tidy, hard's a nut, and
                  not bigger'n a cotton bale.' 'Well,' says I, 'I will;' and, Gin'ral, Phylly's the
                  gal! She'll hev good times, live like a queen, he wines, dresses, hosses, operas,
                  and all them sort o' things; ye knows them ar fellers doan't stand fur trifles.'
                  'Yes, I knows, Lark,' says the Gin'ral; 'and bein' it's so, ye kin take har; but I
                  wouldn't sell har ter ary nother man livin'—ef I would, d—n me. Ye kin hev har,
                  Lark, but ye must take the young 'uns; she's got two, ye knows, and it hain't
                  Christian-like ter sell 'em apart.' 'D—n the young 'uns, Gin'ral,' says I; 'I
                  karn't do nary a thing with them, What'll one o' them young bloods want o' them?
                  They goes in fur home manufactures.' 'Yes, I knows, Lark,' says he, 'but ye kin
                  sell 'em off thar; ony planter'll buy 'em; they'll pay ter raise. They're likely
                  little gals, ye knows—honest born, white father, and'll make han'some
                  wimmin—han'somer'n thar mother, and'll sell higher when they's grow'd up. Ye'd
                  better take 'em Lark. Ef ye doan't, I'm d—d ef I'll sell ye the mother; fur, ye
                  see, I <emph>must</emph> have the whole vally, now, thet's honest.' 'Wall,
                  Gin'ral,' says, I, 'ye allers talks right out, thet's what I likes in ye. What's
                  the price?' 'Wall,' says he, 'bein' it's ye, and ye've a good master in yer eye
                  fur Phylly, I'll say two thousand fur the lot—the gal alone'll fotch twenty-five
                  hun'red down ter Orleans.' 'Whew!' says I, 'Gin'ral, ye've been a takin' suthin'.
                  (But he hedn't; he war soberer than a church clock; 'twarn't more'n 'lev'n, and
                  he's never drunk 'fore evenin'.) 'Wall,' says I, 'karn't think on it, nohow,
                  Gin'ral.' Then he come down ter eighteen; but I counted out sixteen fifty—good
                  rags on the ole State Bank—and I'm blamed ef he didn't take it. I'd no idee he
                  wud; but debt, Mr. Kirke, debt's the devil; but it helps us, 'case, I s'pose (and
                  he laughed his hardened, brutal laugh), we does the devil's own work. But be thet
                  how it may, ef them highflyin' planters didn't run inter it, and hev ter pay up,
                  nigger spec'latin' wouldn't be wuth follerin'. Wall, I took the nigs, and thar
                  they is; and bein' it's ye, Mr. Kirke, and ye're a friend on the ole man, ye shill
                  hev the lot fur a hun'red and fifty more—or the 'ooman alone fur fifteen hun'red;
                  but ary nother white man couldn't toch 'em fur less'n two thousand—ef they could,
                  d—n me."</p>
               <p>The stage had not arrived, and I had submitted to this lengthy harangue, because I
                  saw I was more sure to accomplish the purchase by indulging the humor of the
                  trader. The suspense was, no doubt, agony to Phyllis, and Preston manifested
                  decided impatience, but the delay seemed unavoidable. It was difficult for the
                  latter to control himself. He chafed like a chained tiger. At first he paced up
                  and down the farther side of the apartment, then sat down, then rose and paced the
                  room again, and then again sat down, every now and then glaring upon Larkin with a
                  look of savage ferocity that showed the wild beast was rising in him. The trader
                  once in a while looked toward him with a cool unconcern that indicated two things:
                  nerves of iron, and perfect familiarity with such demonstrations</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6528-00000039"/>
               <p>Fearing an explosion, I at last stepped up to the Squire, and said, in a low tone:
                  "Let me beg of you to leave the room; <emph>do</emph>—you may spoil all." He made
                  no reply, but did as I requested.</p>
               <p>When he had gone, Larkin remarked, in an indifferent way, "The Squire's got the
                  devil in him. He's some when his blood's up—edged tools, dangerous ter handle; he
                  is—I knows him. I'd ruther hev six like Tom on me, ony time, than one like him.
                  But he karn't skeer me. The man doan't breathe thet kin turn Jake Larkin a
                  hair."</p>
               <p>"I see he's excited," I replied; "but why is he so interested in this woman?"</p>
               <p>"Why? She was fotched up 'long with him—children together. He owned har till he
                  got in the nineholes one day, and sold har ter the Gin'ral. I'd bet a pile the
                  young 'uns ar his'n. He knows har as he do the psa'm book. Ha! ha!" and he chucked
                  Phyllis again under the chin, as he asked, "Doan't he, gal?"</p>
               <p>She shrank away from him, but said nothing.</p>
               <p>"Doan't be squeamy, gal; out with it; we'll think the more on ye fur't. Arn't the
                  young 'uns his'n?. Didn't ye b'long ter the Squire till he got so d—d pious five
                  year ago?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, master; I belonged to him. Master Robert was allers pious."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I knows; he wus allers preachin' pious. But didn't ye b'long ter him—ye
                  knows what I means—till he got so d—d camp-meetin' pious?"</p>
               <p>"Master Robert was allers camp-meetin' pious," replied the woman, looking down,
                  and drawing her thin shawl more closely over her open bosom.</p>
               <p>"Wall," said Larkin, "ye karn't git nothin' out o' har; but it's so—shore! Ev'ry
                  'un says so; and what ev'ry 'un says, arn't more'n a mile from the truth. Jest
                  look o' thet little 'un. Doan't ye see the Squire's eyes and forrerd thar?" and,
                  taking the little girl roughly by the arm, he turned her face toward mine. The
                  lower part of her features were like her mother's; but her eyes, hair, and
                  forehead, were Preston's!</p>
               <p>"Yes, I see," I said; "but you spoke of <emph>two</emph> little girls; where is
                  the other?"</p>
               <p>"Wall, ye see, I bought 'em both, and the Gin'ral guv me a bill o' sale on 'em;
                  but when we come to look arter the young 'un in the mornin', she warn't thar. The
                  Gin'ral's 'ooman—she's a 'ooman fur me—a whole team; she makes him stan' round,
                     <emph>I</emph> reckon—wall, she'd a likin' fur the little 'un, and she swoore
                  she shouldn't be sold. She told me ter my face she'd packed har off whar I
                  couldn't git har, nohow; and she'd raise the town, and hev me driv' out, ef I
                  'tempted it."</p>
               <p>"What did you do then?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Wall, ye knows the Gin'ral's a honerubble man; so, when he seed his 'ooman wus
                  sot thet way, he throw'd in the yaller boy—and he's wuth a hun'red more'n the gal,
                  ony day. His mother took on ter kill, 'case the Gin'ral'd sort o' promised him ter
                  har, and she'd been a savin' up ter buy him. But the Gin'ral's a honerubble man,
                  and he didn't flinch a hair—not a hair. Thet's the sort ter deal with, I say. I
                  stuck fur the little gal, though—'case, ye see, I'd taken a likin' ter har
                  myself—she's the pootiest little thing ye ever seed, she is; but the Gin'ral he
                  said 'twarn't no use, fur his 'ooman would hev har way; and finarly I guv in, and
                  took another bill o' sale. And what d'ye think! I'd no more'n got it inter my
                  pocket, 'fore<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6528-00000040"/> the Gin'ral's 'ooman pulled
                  out a gold watch, two or three diamond pins, a ring or two, and some wimmin
                  fixin's, and says she, 'See thar, <emph>Mister</emph> Larkin; them's what I got
                  fur the little gal. <emph>I've</emph> sold har—sold har this mornin', and guv the
                  bill o' sale; and ef the Gin'ral doan't sartify it, he woan't git no peace, I
                  reckon. I wus bound ter see one on 'em done right by, I wus.' Wall, I told har she
                  wus ahead o' my time, and I put out kinder sudden, I did. A 'ooman's the devil;
                  I'd ruther trade with twenty men nor one 'ooman, I swar."</p>
               <p>When he spoke of her child, the slave woman burst into tears. Her emotion drowned
                  the curiosity which had made me a patient listener to the trader's story, and
                  recalled me to the business in hand. With some twinges of conscience for having
                  kept the wretched girl so long on the rack, I said to him, "Well, Larkin, let's
                  get through with this. What is your lowest price for the lot?"</p>
               <p>"P'raps you'd as lief throw out the boy? I'd take eff three hun'red fur him."</p>
               <p>"Oh! doan't ye leab Ally, massa! buy Ally too, massa! oh! do, good massa!" he
                  cried, with an expression of keen agony such as I had never till then seen in one
                  so young. He was a "likely" little fellow, with a round, good-natured face, and a
                  bright, intelligent eye; and, though I presumed Preston felt no particular
                  interest in him, I thought of his mother, depriving herself of sleep and rest to
                  save up the price of her child, and I said: "No, I have taken a liking to him;
                  I'll take the whole, or none."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, seventeen fifty—not a dime less. Thet's only a hun'red profit."</p>
               <p>"Will a hundred profit satisfy you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, bein' as ye's a friend o' the ole man, and I hain't had 'em only four
                  days."</p>
               <p>I sat down on the bench beside the little girl, and taking her small hand in mine,
                  and playing with her fingers in a careless way, said: "Well, I will give you a
                  hundred profit; but, Larkin," and I looked him directly in the eye, and smiled,
                  "you can't intend to come the Yankee over me! I am one of them myself, you know,
                  and understand such things. These people cost you twelve hundred—not a dime
                  more."</p>
               <p>"The h—ll they did! P'raps ye mean ter say I lie?" he replied, in an excited tone,
                  his face reddening with anger.</p>
               <p>"No, I don't. I merely state a fact, and you know it. So keep cool."</p>
               <p>"It's a d—d lie, sir; I doan't keer who says it," he exclaimed, now really
                  excited.</p>
               <p>"Come, come, my fine fellow," I said, rising, and facing him; "skip the hard
                  words, and don't get up too much steam; it might damage you, <emph>or your
                     friends.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"What d'ye mean? Speak out, Mr. Kirke. Ef ye doan't want ter buy 'em, say so, and
                  hev done with it." This was said in a more moderate tone. He had evidently taken
                  my meaning, and feared he had gone too far.</p>
               <p>"I mean simply this: This woman and the children cost you twelve hundred dollars
                  four days ago. Preston wants them—<emph>must</emph> have them—and he will give
                  thirteen hundred for them, and pay you in a year, with interest; that's all."</p>
               <p>"Wall, come now, Mr. Kirke, thet's liberal, arn't it! S'pose I doan't take it,
                  what then?"</p>
               <p>"Then Roye, Struthers &amp; Co. will stop your supplies, <emph>or I'll stop
                     their's</emph>—that's 'SARTIN,'" and I laughed good-humoredly as I said it.</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6528-00000041"/>
               <p>"Wall, ye're one on 'em, Mr. Kirke, thet's a fact;" and then he added, seriously,
                  "but ye karn't mean ter saddle my doin's onter them?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will; and tell them they have you to thank for it."</p>
               <p>"What"—and he struck his forehead with his hand—"what a dangnation fool I wus ter
                  tell ye 'bout them!"</p>
               <p>"Of course you were; and a greater one to say you paid sixteen fifty for the
                  property. I'd have given fifteen hundred for them, if you had told the truth. But
                  come, what do you say; are they Preston's, or not?"</p>
               <p>"No, I karn't do it; karn't take Preston's note—'tain't wuth a hill o' beans. Give
                  me the money, and it's a trade."</p>
               <p>"Preston is cramped, and cannot pay the money now. I'll give you <emph>my</emph>
                  note, if you prefer it."</p>
               <p>"Payable in York, interest and exchange?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, it's done. And now, d—n the nigs. I'll never buy ary nother good-lookin'
                  'un as long's I live."</p>
               <p>"I hope you won't," I replied, laughing.</p>
               <p>He then produced a blank note and a bill of sale, and drawing from his pocket a
                  pen and a small ink bottle, said to me: "Thar, Mr. Kirke, ye fill up the note, and
                  I'll make out the bill o' sale. I'm handy at sech doin's."</p>
               <p>"Give me the key of these bracelets first. Make out the bill to Preston—Robert
                  Preston, of Jones County."</p>
               <p>He handed me the key, and I unlocked the shackles. "Now, Phyllis," I said, "it is
                  over. Go and tell Master Robert."</p>
               <p>She rose, threw her arms wildly above her head, and, staggering weakly forward,
                  without saying a word, left the cabin. Yelping and leaping with joy, the yellow
                  boy followed her; but the little girl came to me, and, looking up timidly in my
                  face, said: "Oh! massa, Rosey so glad 'ou got mammy—Rosey <emph>so</emph> glad.
                  Rosey lub 'ou, massa—Rosey lub 'ou a heap." I thought of a little girl I had left
                  at home, and, with a sudden impulse, lifted the child from the floor and kissed
                  her. She put her small arms about my neck, laid her soft cheek against mine, and
                  burst into tears.</p>
               <p>I filled out the note, and gave it to the trader; and, with the bill of sale in my
                  hand, was about to go in search of Preston, when he and Phyllis entered the cabin.
                  I handed him the document, and, glancing over it, he placed it in his pocket
                  book.</p>
               <p>"Now, Larkin," I said, "this is a wretched business. Give it up; there's too much
                  of the man in you for this sort of thing."</p>
               <p>"Wall, p'raps ye're right, Mr. Kirke; but I'm in it, and I karn't git out. But it
                  seems ter me 'tain't no wuss dealin' in 'em, than ownin' 'em."</p>
               <p>"I don't know. Is it not a little worse on the man himself? Does it not sort of
                  harden you—blunt your better feelings—to be always buying and selling people that
                  do not want to be bought and sold?"</p>
               <p>"Wall, p'raps it do; it's a cussed business, onyhow. But thar's my hand, Mr.
                  Kirke. Ye're a gintleman, I swar, ef ye <emph>hev</emph> come it over me. Ha! ha!
                  How slick you done it! I likes ye the better fur it; and ef Jake Larkin kin ever
                  do ye a good turn, he'll do it. I allers takes ter a man thet's smarter nor I ar,
                  I does;" and he gave my hand another powerful shake.</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6528-00000042"/>
               <p>"I thank you, Larkin; and if I can ever serve <emph>you,</emph> it will give me
                  great pleasure to do so."</p>
               <p>"I doan't doubt it, Mr. Kirke, I doan't; and I'll call on ye, shore, ef ye kin
                  ever do me ony good. Good-by; ye want ter be with the Squire; good-by;" and he
                  left the cabin.</p>
               <p>Which was the worse—that coarse, hardened man, or the institution which had made
                  him what he was?</p>
               <p>Many years afterward the trader and I met again; and then he kept his word.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <head type="sub">ON THE ROAD.</head>
               <p>IT was nine o'clock at night, when the stage halted before the door of that
                  purgatory for Southern pilgrims, the "Washington House," Newbern. As we dismounted
                  from the box, Preston said to me:</p>
               <p>"You order supper and a room, while I attend to Phyllis and the children. I'll
                  join you presently."</p>
               <p>Seeing that our luggage was safely deposited on the piazza, I entered the hotel in
                  quest of the landlord. The "office" was a long, low, dingy apartment, with
                  tobacco-stained floor, blackened ceiling, and greasy, brown walls, ornamented here
                  and there with advertisements of runaway slaves, auction notices of "mules,
                  negroes, and other property," a few dusty maps, and a number of unframed wood-cuts
                  of prominent political characters. Among the latter, Calhoun, in bristling hair,
                  cadaverous face, and high shirt collar, looked "the unkindest cut of all." Behind
                  the bar, which extended across the farther end of the room, was drawn up a whole
                  regiment of glass decanters, and stout black bottles, full of spirit, and ready
                  for active service. A generous wood fire roared and crackled on a broad
                  hearthstone, and in a semicircle around it, in every conceivable attitude, were
                  gathered about twenty<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6528-00000043"/> planters' sons,
                  village shopkeepers, turpentine farmers, itinerant horse dealers, and cattle
                  drovers. Some had their heels a trifle higher than their heads, some were seated
                  on the knees of others, some were lounging on the arms of chairs, and some were
                  stretched at full length on a pile of trunks near by; but all were too much
                  engaged in smoking, expectorating, and listening to a horse-trading narrative,
                  which one of their number was relating, to heed my entrance.</p>
               <p>"Wall, ye see," said the story teller, "Dick come the possum over him—made b'lieve
                  he wus drunk, though he warn't, no more'n I ar; but he tuk durned good keer ter
                  see the ole man get well slewed, he did. Wall, wen the ole feller wus pooty well
                  primed, Dick stuck his arm inter his'n, toted him off ter the stable, and fotched
                  out a ole, spavin'd, wind-galled, used-up, broken-down critter, thet couldn't gwo
                  a rod, 'cept ye got another hoss to haul him; and says he: 'See thar! thar's a
                  perfect paragone o' hoss-flesh; a raal Arab; nimble's a cricket; sunder'n a nut;
                  gentler'n a cooin' dove, and faster'n a tornado! I doan't sell 'im fur nary fault,
                  and ye couldn't buy 'im fur no price, ef I warn't hard put. Come, now, what d'ye
                  say? I'll put 'im ter ye fur one fifty, an' its less'n he cost, it ar!' Wall, the
                  ole man tuk—swollored the critter whole—tuk him down without greasin', he did—ha!
                  ha!"</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha!" repeated the listening crowd, and "Yah! yah!" echoed three or four
                  well-dressed darkies, who were standing near the doorway. "Sarved 'im right; he'm
                  a mean ole cuss, he am," chimed in one of the latter gentry (who, I saw, was the
                  perfumed ebony who figured at the turkey match), as he added another guffaw, and,
                  swaying his body back and forth, brought his hands down on his thighs with a
                  concussion which sent a thick cloud of tobacco smoke, of his own manufacture,
                  circling to the other side of the room.</p>
               <p>When the merriment had somewhat subsided, I stepped toward the assemblage, and
                  inquired if the landlord were present. There was no reply for a few moments; then
                  one of the embryo planters, speaking to a showily-dressed young man near him,
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Get up, and 'tend to the stranger. You arn't fit to tote victuals to a
                  nigger."</p>
               <p>The young man rose very deliberately, and said:</p>
               <p>"Want ter see the keeper, do ye?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; I want a room, and supper for two, at once."</p>
               <p>"Room, and supper fur two?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; a room with a fire and two beds."</p>
               <p>"Whar d'ye come from?"</p>
               <p>"From Goldsboro'; just in by the stage."</p>
               <p>"Oh! stage's in, is it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; the stage is in. You'll oblige me by attending to us at once; we are
                  hungry and tired."</p>
               <p>He looked at me for a moment without speaking, then leisurely walked out through
                  the front door. Two or three of the loungers followed, but the young gentleman who
                  had first spoken, rose, and politely tendered me a seat. Thanking him, I took the
                  chair vacated by the bartender, and proceeded to warm my hands and limbs, which
                  were thoroughly chilled by the long ride in the cold air.</p>
               <p>"Cold, riding after nightfall, sir," said the young man, who I now observed was
                  the Mr. Gaston whom the trader had so unceremoniously ejected from the shooting
                  ground.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir; it <emph>is</emph> cold riding on the box."</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6528-00000044"/>
               <p>"And our rattle-down coaches are so mighty slow. You don't have such fixin's at
                  the North."</p>
               <p>"No, sir; but why do you suppose I'm from the North? I've passed for a Southerner
                  to-day."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I know you Yankees all to pieces; I've lived among you."</p>
               <p>"At college, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; at Harvard."</p>
               <p>"You graduated early."</p>
               <p>"No, I didn't graduate, I <emph>left</emph>—left for my health. Ha! ha!" and he
                  broke into a merry fit of laughter, in which several of his companions joined.</p>
               <p>"Taken with sudden illness, as you were at the turkey match, to-day?" I inquired
                  good-humoredly, and in a tone that could not give offence.</p>
               <p>"Yes; the same disease, I swear. Ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha!" echoed his companions.</p>
               <p>"The stranger's inter ye, Gus—inter ye a feet! Come, ye must treat," shouted the
                  teller of the horse story.</p>
               <p>This last individual was tall, rawboned, and squarely built, with broad, heavy
                  features, and dull, cold, snake-like eyes. His black, unkempt hair, and long, wiry
                  beard, fell round his face like tow round a mop handle; and his coarse linsey
                  clothes, patched in many places, and smeared with tar and tobacco juice, fitted
                  him as they might have fitted a prolonged pair of tongs. The legs of his
                  pantaloons were thrust inside his boots, and he wore a fuzzy woollen hat with
                  battered crown and broad flapping brim. He looked the very picture of an
                  ex-overseer under a cloud, or an itinerant sporting man, anxious for something to
                  turn up.</p>
               <p>I declined the proffered drink, but the company rose and approached the counter,
                  while the young planter bade the bartender, who had just reëntered, "trot out the
                  consolation."</p>
               <p>"Down with the pewter, then, Mr. Gaston," said the liquor vender. "No pay, no
                  drinks, in this yere shanty."</p>
               <p>The young man tossed him a half eagle. His companions proceeded to imbibe a
                  variety of compounds, while he poured out nearly a glass full of raw whiskey, and
                  drank it down at a swallow. As he replaced the glass on the counter, a slatternly
                  negro woman thrust her head in at the doorway, saying:</p>
               <p>"Dar's a 'ooman heah—a wite 'ooman, dat am 'ticler anxyus fur de honor ob Mister
                  Mulock's 'quaintance. She'm in de sittin' room'."</p>
               <p>"Thar's a call for you, Bony," said the young planter to the story teller; "some
                  young woman with designs on your landed possessions—ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>Without replying, the other followed the serving woman from the bar room. He was
                  the absconding polygamist for whom the tobacco-chewing female had ventured all the
                  way from Chalk-Level.</p>
               <p>"Is supper ready, sir?" I asked of the bartender.</p>
               <p>"Supper?—I reckon so. Ye'd better go and see," was the civil reply.</p>
               <p>"Where's the dining room?"</p>
               <p>"Over thar—'tother side the hall."</p>
               <p>Passing out of the room, I met Preston, and we proceeded together to the supper
                  table. When we were seated, I remarked:</p>
               <p>"By the way, I have just seen the husband of our stage coach acquaintance. He's a
                  rum-looking customer."</p>
               <pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC6528-00000045"/>
               <p>"Yes, I suppose he has taken to drinking again. The whipping, and the loss of
                  Phylly, have probably worked on him."</p>
               <p>"You don't mean to say <emph>he</emph> is Phylly's husband?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; didn't I tell you?"</p>
               <p>"No. Two wives under one roof! Well, that's more than most white men can
                  afford."</p>
               <p>"That's a fact. It's an awkward business; what had better be done?"</p>
               <p>"Done? Why, let him go. You'll be well rid of him. He's a worthless fellow, or
                  nature doesn't write English. I read 'scoundrel' all over his face."</p>
               <p>"He <emph>has</emph> a bad nature; but Phylly's influence on him is good, and she
                  loves him."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Loves</emph> him! Well, there's no accounting for tastes."</p>
               <p>"That's true," replied the Squire; "but we all love those to whom we do good. She
                  married Mulock after nursing him through a long illness, and has tamed him, though
                  it was taming a wolf."</p>
               <p>We soon left the table. Preston went into the sitting room, while I resumed my
                  seat by the bar-room fire.</p>
               <p>I had nearly finished my evening cigar, when Preston came into the office. Shaking
                  hands with young Gaston and a number of the others, who all greeted him with
                  marked respect, he said to me:</p>
               <p>"What shall I do? Mulock's wife will let him off, if I pay her a hundred
                  dollars."</p>
               <p>"Pay her a hundred dollars!" I exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Yes; she'll release him to Phyllis for that—give a paper to that effect. What
                  would you do?"</p>
               <p>The idea was so ludicrous, that, in spite of the Squire's serious manner, I burst
                  into a fit of laughter. Between the mirthful explosions I managed to say:</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Preston; but I never before heard of selling a husband—at so low a
                  price. Ha! ha! Do not buy him; he isn't worth the money." Then, seeing that he
                  appeared hurt, I added: "What does Phyllis say?"</p>
               <p>"I haven't told her. She'll feel badly to have him go; but it's not right for me
                  to pay the money. I should pay my debts first."</p>
               <p>Mr. Gaston, whose attention had been attracted to our conversation by my rather
                  boisterous merriment, now said, making a strong effort to appear serious:</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Squire; but what is it? Has Mulock two wives; and does one offer to
                  sell out for a hundred dollars?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Preston, in a tone which showed a decided disinclination to
                  conversation.</p>
               <p>"Buy him, then, Squire; I'll give you twenty-five dollars for the bargain, on the
                  spot—I will, I swear;" and, unable to contain himself longer, he burst into an
                  uproarious fit of merriment, in which the by-sitters joined.</p>
               <p>Preston's face darkened, and, in a grave voice, he said:</p>
               <p>"Young man, you forget yourself. I am sorry to see you so wanting in respect to
                  others, and—yourself."</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Preston," replied Gaston, in an apologetic tone; "I meant
                  no offence, sir—upon my soul, I did not. If Mulock is for sale for a——"here his
                  risibilities again gave way—"for a hundred dollars, I'll buy him, for it's cheap;
                  I swear it's cheap, seeing he's a white man."</p>
               <p>Preston, by this time really angered, was about to make a harsh reply, when I
                  interrupted him:</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6528-00000046"/>
               <p>"Never mind, my friend; let Mr Gaston buy him—he can afford it. Do it, Gaston; it
                  will be both a capital joke and a good action; do it <emph>at once.</emph>"</p>
               <p>The glass of raw whiskey had somewhat "elevated" the young planter, and my
                  conscience demurred a little at the advice I gave him; but I recovered my usual
                  self-complacency on reflecting that he would undoubtedly put the money to a much
                  worse use.</p>
               <p>Saying "D—d if I won't," Gaston drew forth his purse, and counted out a number of
                  half eagles. Finding he had not enough, he turned to another young planter, and
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Here, Bob, I'm short; lend me fifty dollars."</p>
               <p>"Bob" produced his wallet, and, without counting them, handed him a roll of
                  bills.</p>
               <p>"Now, stranger, come along; I want you to draw up the papers, and witness the
                  trade—ha! ha! Is she in the parlor, Squire?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Preston, taking the seat I had vacated.</p>
               <p>The young man put his arm into mine, and we proceeded to the "sitting room."</p>
               <p>Mulock was seated before the fire, gazing intently at the blaze. His wife sat
                  opposite, speaking earnestly to him. Every now and then she wetted a short piece
                  of wood with saliva, and, dipping it into a snuff bottle, mopped her teeth and
                  gums with the savory powder. She was—as her husband might have said—a perfect
                  "paragone" of "poor white" womanhood, with all the accomplishments of her
                  class—smoking, chewing, and snuff dipping.</p>
               <p>As we approached, she lifted her eyes, and Gaston said to her.</p>
               <p>"Are you the lady who has a man for sale—a likely white man?"</p>
               <p>"Wall, stranger, I reckon I'm the 'ooman. Thet ar feller's my husband, an' he
                  karn't git off 'cept I git a hundred dollars."</p>
               <p>"Will you give a bill of sale, releasing all your right, title, and interest in
                  him to me, if I pay you a hundred dollars?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I wull; ter ye, or ter onybody."</p>
               <p>"Wall, now," continued Gaston, imitating her tone, "karn't ye take a trifle less'n
                  thet—eighty, or so?"</p>
               <p>"No, stranger; nary dime under thet. I'm gol-durned ef I does."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mulock, what do you say? Are you willing to be sold?"</p>
               <p>"I hain't willin' ter be laff'd at by ye, nor nobody else," replied Mulock,
                  rising, and turning fiercely on the planter. "I'll larrup the d—d 'ooman onyhow,
                  and ye, too, ef ye say much more."</p>
               <p>"Come, Mulock," said the young man, coolly, but firmly, "be civil, or I'll let
                  daylight through you before you're a minute older. I'm disposed to do you a good
                  turn, but you must be civil, by——."</p>
               <p>"Wall, do as ye likes, Gus; onything'll suit me," replied Mulock, resuming his
                  previous position.</p>
               <p>"But, d—n you, if I spend a hundred on you, you must go to work like a man, and
                  try to pay it. I wouldn't do it, anyhow, if it warn't for Phylly."</p>
               <p>"But Phylly's gone," said Mulock, in a dejected tone; "gone—toted off by thet d—d
                  trader. If I hadn't a ben in the cussed jug, I'd a killed him."</p>
               <p>"No, she isn't gone; she's here—Preston's bought her."</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6528-00000047"/>
               <p>Mulock sprang to his feet; his dull, cold eye lighted, and, seizing the young man
                  by the arm, he exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Doan't ye lie ter me, Gus; <emph>is</emph> she yere?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, so Bob says; he saw her get out of the stage."</p>
               <p>Mulock made no reply, but strode toward the door. Gaston said quickly:</p>
               <p>"Hold on, Bony; don't vamose just yet. D—d if I'll help you out of this, if you
                  don't promise to work like an honest fellow to pay me."</p>
               <p>"I will, Gus; I'll leave off drinkin' ter onst; I'll work day and night, I
                  will."</p>
               <p>"Well, my rustic beauty, are you ready to sign a bill of sale?"</p>
               <p>"Yas; but I reckon, bein' as ye set so high on Bony, ye kin go a trifle more'n
                  thet—jest the 'spenses down yere?"</p>
               <p>"Not another red," said Gaston.</p>
               <p>"Wall, he ain't of no account, nohow; I reckon he ain't wuth no more. Count out
                  th' pewter."</p>
               <p>I procured writing materials from the bar room, and in a few moments drew up a
                  paper, by which, in consideration of one hundred dollars to her in hand that day
                  paid, Jane Mulock, of Chalk-Level, in the county of Harnet, and State of North
                  Carolina, did sell, assign, transfer, make over, convey, and forever quit claim
                  unto Phyllis Preston, otherwise known as Phyllis Mulock, of the town of Newbern,
                  in the county of Craven, and State aforesaid, all her right, title, and interest
                  in and to the body, soul, wearing apparel, and other possessions, of one Napoleon
                  Bonaparte Mulock, whom the said Jane charged with being her husband; and also all
                  claims or demands she had on him for a support, she binding herself never to
                  institute any suit or suits against him in any court of the State of North
                  Carolina, or of any other State, or of the United States, for the crime of bigamy,
                  or for any other crime, misdemeanor, or abomination committed against herself at
                  any time prior to the date of said instrument. In testimony whereof, she, the said
                  Jane Mulock, did sign the sign of the cross, and affix her seal to a half sheet of
                  dirty paper, whereto Gustavus A. Gaston, and the writer hereof, were
                  witnesses.</p>
               <p>Both Mulock and his wife thought the instrument a valid one. He again took Phyllis
                  to his bosom, and Jane, I have been told, married another husband. In view of the
                  latter fact, I have never been able to wholly satisfy my conscience for the part I
                  took in the transaction.</p>

               <head type="sub">A SLAVE MOTHER.</head>
               <p>WHILE we were at breakfast on the following morning, Preston said to me:</p>
               <p>"I think I had better leave Phylly and Rosey here till I can consult with my wife.
                  We have house servants enough, and Phylly can't work in the field. It may be
                  advisable to have her remain in Newbern."</p>
               <p>"And what will you do with the yellow boy?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! take him with us. There's always something the little fellows can do. We'll
                  call at his mother's, and get him."</p>
               <p>We decided to set out for the plantation at once, and Preston ordered a livery
                  wagon to be got in readiness. While we were waiting for it, I walked out upon the
                  piazza. I had not been there long, before "young Joe"—Preston's only son—rode up
                  to the hotel. He was a manly lad, about twelve years of age, and in form,
                  features, and manners, a miniature edition of his father. He had grown amazingly
                  since at my house, two years before, and I did not at once recognize him; but as
                  he caught sight of me, he shouted out in boyish glee, throwing his bridle over the
                  hitching post, and springing to the ground:</p>
               <p>"Oh! Mr. Kirke. I'm so glad you've come; mother will be <emph>so</emph> glad to
                  see you. We'll have such a nice time."</p>
               <p>"Why, Joe, I thought you were at home!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! no. I'm here at school; but father says I shall have a vacation while you're
                  here. Why didn't you fetch Frank? You promised you would."</p>
               <p>"I know I did, Joe; but his mother wouldn't let him come. She thinks he's too
                  young to travel."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! He's old enough—'most as old as I am. But never mind, Mr. Kirke; we'll
                  have a fine time, hunting and fishing, and going to the races. They're to have a
                  big one over to Trenton next week, and I'm bound to go. It's <emph>so</emph> lucky
                  you've come."</p>
               <p>"Lord bless you, Joe! I never was at a race, and never shot a gun in my life.
                  Besides, I can remain only a day or two."</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes, you can. Father says you Yorkers are always in a hurry; but you must
                  take it easy now. I'll show you round, and learn you the ropes."</p>
               <p>While I was laughing at the enthusiasm of the lad, the wagon drove up, and,
                  Preston soon appearing, we entered it, and drove off. As Joe bounded upon his
                  spirited horse and led the way down the elm-shaded street, I said to his
                  father:</p>
               <p>"How that boy rides! He's a perfect Centaur."</p>
               <p>"Yes, he <emph>is</emph> a good horseman; he's been trained to it. You know we
                  think manly exercises an essential part of a gentleman's education."</p>
               <p>"And you let Joe keep his own horse?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; it's awfully expensive; but old Joe raised the colt for the boy, and I
                  couldn't deny him."</p>
               <p>We rode on to the outskirts of the town, and stopped before a small, tumble-down
                  shanty, built of rough boards, and<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6528-00000049"/> roofed
                  with the same material. In the narrow front yard, a large iron pot, supported on
                  two upright poles, was steaming over a light wood fire. The boiling clothes it
                  contained were being stirred by a brawny, coal-black negro woman, with an arm like
                  the Farnese Hercules, and a form as stout as Wouter Van Twiller's. The yellow boy,
                  Ally, was heaping wood on the fire.</p>
               <p>"How do you do, aunty?" said Preston, as we drew up at the rickety gate.</p>
               <p>"Right smart, massa, right smart," replied the woman; then, turning round and
                  recognizing the Squire, she added: "Oh! massa Preston, am dat 'ou? Oh! I'se so
                  'joiced 'ou got Ally; I'se <emph>so</emph> 'joiced! De Lord yere my prayer, massa;
                  de Lord yere my prayer. I feel like I die wid joy, de Lord so good ter me. Oh!
                  He'm so good ter me!"</p>
               <p>"The Lord is good to all who love Him. He never fails those that trust in Him,"
                  said Preston, solemnly.</p>
               <p>"No more'n He doan't, massa; no more'n He doan't. De good missus tole me dat jess
                  wen dey toted de pore chile 'way; but I couldn't b'lieve it, massa; I couldn't
                  b'lieve it. It 'peared like I neber'd see 'im agin—neber'd see 'im agin; but I
                  prayed de Lord. massa—I prayed de Lord all de time—all de time dat de chile wus
                  'way: I hab no sleep, I eat 'most nuffin, an' my heart grow so big, I fought it
                  would clean broke; but lass night, massa, jess wen it 'peared like I couldn't
                  stan' it no more—wen I wus a cryin' an' a groanin' to de Lord wid all my might,
                  den, massa, de Lord He hard me, an' He open de door, an' de little chile run in,
                  an' he put him arms round my neck, an' he telled me I need neber cry no more,
                  'case de good massa had got him! Oh! it wus too much, massa, fur 'ou's so good—de
                  Lord's so good, massa! Oh! I feel like I should die ob joy." Here she sat down on
                  a rude bench near by, covered her face with her apron, and sobbed like a child.
                  Preston's eyes filled with tears, but, brushing them hastily away, he asked, as if
                  to change the subject:</p>
               <p>"Did you say the 'missus' had been down?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa; de good missus come down jess so soon as she hard Phylly war sold;
                  an' wen she fine Ally war gwine too, she come ter see de ole 'ooman—she did,
                  massa—and she try to comfut har. She say de good Lord would fotch Ally back, an'
                  He hab, massa! Oh! He hab."</p>
               <p>"Well, Dinah, what shall we do with Ally? Do you want him to go to the
                  plantation?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! yas, massa; I want de chile ter be wid 'ou. I'd <emph>rudder</emph> he'd be
                  wid 'ou, massa; but, massa"—and she spoke timidly, and with hesitation—"'ou knows
                  ole massa promise ter sell Ally ter me—ter sell 'im ter me wen I'd a sabed up
                  'nuff ter buy 'im. An' will 'ou, massa, will 'ou?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Dinah; of course I will," said Preston.</p>
               <p>"Oh! bress 'ou, massa; bress 'ou. It'm so good ob 'ou—<emph>so</emph> good ob 'ou,
                  massa;" and she sobbed harder than before.</p>
               <p>"How much have you saved, aunty?"</p>
               <p>"A hun'red and firteen dollar, massa; an' dar's some more'n dat massa Blackwell am
                  ter gib fur usin' on it. Massa Blackwell's got it. How much shill I pay fur Ally,
                  massa?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't know; the trader offered three hundred for him. You may have him
                  for half that."</p>
               <p>"How much'm dat, massa?"</p>
               <p>"A hundred and fifty dollars."</p>
               <p>"He'm wuth more'n dat, massa Preston; ole massa say<pb n="98-99"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000050"/> Ally wuth two hun'red an' fifty, or three hun'red,
                  ob any folks' money. He'm a likely boy, massa."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know that; I don't mean to undervalue him. I wouldn't sell him to any one
                  else for less than three hundred dollars."</p>
               <p>"Oh! tank 'ou, massa; it'm good ob 'ou—bery good ob 'ou, massa;" and again her
                  apron found the way to her eyes.</p>
               <p>"Well," said Preston, after a moment's thought, "I think you'd better take him
                  now, aunty. I'm in some trouble, and it's uncertain how things will turn with me;
                  so you'd better take him now."</p>
               <p>"But I hain't money 'nuff, now, massa."</p>
               <p>"Well, never mind; pay the rest when you can, but don't scrimp yourself as you
                  have, Dinah; I shan't mind if you never pay it." The woman seemed bewildered, but
                  said nothing; she evidently was unaccustomed to Preston's mode of doing business.
                  I mentioned to him that he could not give a conveyance of the negro boy until the
                  judgment against him was cancelled.</p>
               <p>"True," he replied; "I didn't think of that. Shall we attend to it now?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, the sooner the better; further costs may accumulate if you delay."</p>
               <p>Preston told the negro woman to meet him at eleven o'clock, at the store of the
                  person who had charge of her money, and we rode at once to the "Old State Bank."
                  It was previous to banking hours, but as the cashier resided in the building, we
                  soon secured notes in exchange for Preston's draft on me, and in less than an hour
                  had the judgment satisfied, and Ally's free papers properly made out and executed.
                  It was not quite ten o'clock when, as we were leaving the attorney's office, we
                  noticed the slave woman and her son seated on the steps of Mr. Blackwell's store
                  opposite.</p>
               <p>"Are you all ready, aunty?" asked Preston.</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa, I'se all ready; I'se got de gole all heah," she replied, holding up a
                  small canvas bag; "a hun'red an' twenty-sevin dollar an' firty cents—so massa
                  Blackwell say; I karn't reckon so much as dat, massa."</p>
               <p>The woman had on a clean white neckerchief, and a bran new pair of brogans, and
                  had made an effort to spruce up for the interview, but she still wore the tattered
                  red and yellow turban, and the thin Osnaburg gown—clean, but patched in many
                  places, in which she was arrayed when over the wash kettle.</p>
               <p>The merchant then came to the door, and invited us in. Preston handed him the
                  papers to examine, and we all entered the store. As the woman laid the gold on the
                  counter, I said to her:</p>
               <p>"Aunty, how long have you been in saving this money?"</p>
               <p>"Four year, massa. Ole massa wouldn't 'gree ter sell de chile till four year
                  ago."</p>
               <p>"And you've hired your time, and earned this by washing and ironing?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, sar; I'se had ter pay massa a hun'red and firty dollar ebery year, 'sides
                  twenty fur rent; an' I'se had ter work bery hard, of'en till 'way inter de night;
                  but I wanted to hab de chile FREE, massa."</p>
               <p>"And have you had no husband to help you?"</p>
               <p>"No, massa; I neber had none; I neber tuk ter de men folks."</p>
               <pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6528-00000051"/>
               <p>She was, as I have said, of a coal-black complexion, while Ally's skin was a
                  bright yellow. His father, therefore, must have been a white man.</p>
               <p>"You have worked very hard, no doubt, aunty. Are these the best clothes you
                  have?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa; dese am <emph>all</emph> I'se got."</p>
               <p>"Well, here are ten dollars; buy yourself some for the winter."</p>
               <p>"Oh! tank 'ou, massa. 'Ou's too good, massa; I tank 'ou bery much; but 'ou'll leff
                  me gib dis ter de Squire, massa, 'on't 'ou? I wants ter pay fur Ally."</p>
               <p>"Yes, if he will take it," I replied, for I felt sure he would not.</p>
               <p>The merchant had examined the documents, and Preston had counted the money and put
                  it in his pocket, when, handing the papers to Dinah, the Squire said:</p>
               <p>"Now, aunty, Ally's free, and I hope he'll grow up a good boy, and worthy of such
                  a mother."</p>
               <p>"Oh! he will dat, massa; he'm a good chile; but heah'm ten dollar more, massa—it'm
                  de good gemman's, an' he say I kin gib it ter 'ou fur Ally."</p>
               <p>Preston laughed. "I heard what he said. I can't take it, Dinah. You need it for
                  winter clothing. I'll take the risk of what you owe me."</p>
               <p>The shopkeeper said:</p>
               <p>"Take it, Squire; I'll let Dinah have what she needs from the store; she knows her
                  credit is good with me."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Preston, taking the money, "this makes one hundred and thirty-seven
                  dollars and thirty cents. You need not pay any more, Dinah; Ally is yours
                     <emph>now.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Oh! am Ally <emph>free,</emph> massa? Am de chile FREE?" she exclaimed, taking
                  him in her arms, and bursting into a hysterical fit of weeping.</p>
               <p>Every eye was wet, but no one spoke. At last Dinah said:</p>
               <p>"But, massa Preston, I wants 'ou ter take de chile. I wants 'ou ter fotch 'im up.
                  I karn't larn 'im nuffin. I doan't know nuffin, massa. He kin git larnin' wid
                  'ou."</p>
               <p>"But he's all you have. At home he'll be a help and a comfort to you."</p>
               <p>"I doan't want no help, massa. He'm FREE now; I doan't want no help no more."</p>
               <p>"Well, aunty, I'll take him, and pay you twenty dollars a year, till he's fifteen.
                  He's twelve, now, isn't he?"</p>
               <p>"A'most twelve, massa, a'most. But 'ou needn't pay <emph>me</emph> nuffin; jess
                  gib de chile what you likes. And, massa, 'ou'll speak ter Boss Joe 'bout 'im,
                  woan't 'ou? 'Ou'll ax 'im ter see Ally gwoes ter de meetin's, an' larns suffin out
                  ob de books, woan't 'ou, massa? I wants him ter know suffin."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will, Dinah; and I'll keep an eye on him myself."</p>
               <p>"Tank 'ou, massa; an' p'raps 'ou'll leff de chile come down ter see 'im ole mammy
                  once'n a while?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will—once a month. Come, now, Dinah, get into the wagon; we go right by
                  your house."</p>
               <p>We stepped into the vehicle, and drove off. When we reached the shanty, the
                  negress got out, and, amid a shower of blessings from her, we rode on to the
                  plantation. For four long years she had worked fifteen hours a day, and denied
                  herself every comfort, to buy her child; and when, at last, she had secured his
                  freedom, she was willing to part from him, that he might "larn suffin out ob de
                  books." <emph>Has not her</emph> wretched race the instincts and feelings that
                  make <emph>us</emph> human?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE PLANTATION.</head>
               <p>IT was a clear, cold, sunshiny day—one of those days so peculiar to the Southern
                  climate, when the blood bounds through every vein as if thrilled by electricity,
                  and a man of lively temperament can scarcely restrain his legs from dancing a
                  "breakdown." We rode rapidly on through a timbered country, where the tall trees
                  grew up close by the roadside, locking their huge arms high in the air, and the
                  long, graceful black moss hung, like mourning drapery, from the great branches.
                  The green pine-tassels carpeted the ground, and breathed a grateful odor around
                  us; and the soft autumn wind swayed the tops of the old trees, and sang a pleasant
                  song over our heads. Every pine bore the scars of the turpentine axe, and here and
                  there, in a patch of woods, a negro gang was gathering the "last dipping;" and now
                  and then, in an open clearing, a poor planter was at work with a few field hands.
                  Occasionally we forded a small stream, where, high up on the bank, was a rude
                  ferry, which served in the rainy season as a miserable substitute for a bridge;
                  and once in a while, far back from the road, we caught sight of an old country
                  seat, whose dingy, unpainted walls, broken-down fences, and dilapidated
                  surroundings, reminded one that shiftless working men, and careless, reckless
                  proprietors are the natural products of slavery. Thus we rode on for several
                  hours, till, turning a slight bend in the road, we suddenly halted before the
                  gateway of my friend's plantation. I had observed, for half a mile, that the woods
                  which lined the wayside were clear of underbrush, the felled trees trimmed, and
                  their branches carefully piled in heaps; and the rails, which in other places
                  straggled about in the road, were doing their appropriate duty on the fences; and
                  I said to Preston:</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see you are as good at planting as at preaching."</p>
               <p>"Bless you!" he replied, "it isn't me; it's Joe. Joe is acknowledged the best
                  farmer in Jones county."</p>
               <p>At the gateway we received a greeting unknown the world over, outside of a
                  Southern plantation. Perched on the fences, swinging on the gate, and hanging in
                  the trees, were a score of young ebonies, of both sexes, who, as we came in sight,
                  set up a chorus of discordant shouts that made the woods ring. Among the noises, I
                  made out: "Gorry! massa'm come." "Dar dey is." "Dat'm de strange gemman." "How's
                  'ou, massa?" "Glad 'ou's come, massa; 'peared like we'd neber see 'ou no more,
                  massa;" and a multitude of similar exclamations, which told unmistakably the kind
                  of discipline to which they were accustomed. The young chattels are infallible
                  plantation barometers—they indicate the true state of the weather. One may never
                  see among the older slaves of a cruel master any but pleasant faces, for they know
                  the penalty of surliness before a stranger; but the little darkies cannot be
                  restrained. They will slink away into by-corners or scamper out of sight whenever
                  their owner appears, if he does not treat them kindly.</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6528-00000053"/>
               <p>"Massa's well. Are you all well?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, massa, we's right smart; an' all on we's good little nigs eber sence 'ou's
                  'way."</p>
               <p>"I'm glad to hear it. Now scamper to the house, and tell 'missus' we're
                  coming."</p>
               <p>"Missus knows 'ou's comin', massa; massa Joe am dar; missus knows 'ou's
                  comin'."</p>
               <p>A short drive throgh a narrow winding avenue, strewn with leaves, and shaded with
                  the long branches of the pine, the oak, and the holly, brought us to the mansion,
                  which stood on a gentle mound in the midst of a green lawn, sloping down to a
                  small lake. It had once been a square, box-like structure; but Preston had so
                  transformed it, that, but for its rustic surroundings, and the thick groups of
                  giant evergreens which clustered at its sides, it might have been taken for a
                  suburban villa. Projecting eaves, large dormers, which sprang out from the
                  roof-line and rested on a broad porch and balcony, a rustic <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">porte cochere,</foreign> and here and there a vine-covered bay
                  or oriole window, broke up the regularity of its outline, and proclaimed its
                  designer a true poet—and poetry, nowadays, is more often written on the walls of
                  country houses, than in the corners of country newspapers.</p>
               <p>Excepting the field hands, nearly all of the "family" had gathered to witness our
                  arrival; but there was no shouting or noisy demonstration. After he had greeted
                  Mrs. Preston and his two little daughters—his twin roses, as he called them—my
                  host turned to the assembled negroes, and gave each one his hand and a kind word.
                  The hearty "Lord bress 'ou, good massa!" and "Glad 'ou's come, massa," which broke
                  from all of them, would have gladdened the heart of even the bitterest opponent of
                  the peculiar institution. One old woman, whose head was white as snow, and whose
                  bent form showed great age, sat on a lower step of the porch, surrounded by a
                  cluster of children. Her mistress raised her to her feet as Preston approached;
                  and, throwing her trembling arms around his neck, she sobbed out:</p>
               <p>"Oh! massa Robert, ole nussy am happy now; she'll neber leff 'ou gwo 'way
                  agin."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Preston shortly turned to lead the way into the house. As she did so, I
                  noticed peeping from out the folds of her dress, where she had shyly hid away, a
                  younger child, of strange and wonderful beauty. She had not, like the others, the
                  fair complexion and pure Grecian features of her mother. Her skin was dark, and
                  her hair, which fell in glossy curls over her neck, was a rich golden brown. Her
                  cheeks seemed two rose leaves thinly sprinkled with snow; her eyes, coals which
                  held a smouldering flame. Her face was one of those caught now and then by the old
                  painters—a thing dreamed of, but seldom seen: the pure expression of an ideal
                  loveliness which is not of the earth. I reached out my hands to her, and said:</p>
               <p>"Come here, my little one. This is one I have not seen, Mrs. Preston."</p>
               <p>"No, sir; we have never taken her North; she is too young. Go to the gentleman, my
                  pet."</p>
               <p>The child came timidly to me, and suffered me to lift her in my arms.</p>
               <p>"And what is your name, my little one?"</p>
               <p>"Selly, sar," she replied, with the soft, mellow accent which the planter's
                  children acquire from the negroes.</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6528-00000054"/>
               <p>"What an odd name!" I remarked.</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir, it <emph>is</emph> singular. Her full name is Selma," replied her
                  mother.</p>
               <p>"What! who have we here?" exclaimed Preston, as he turned away from the negroes,
                  and stepped up on the piazza.</p>
               <p>"Why, it's Selly, Robert. Don't you know your own child?"</p>
               <p>Preston took the little girl in his arms, and said, with some feeling:</p>
               <p>"It's like you, Lucy. No man ever had a wife like mine, Kirke."</p>
               <p>"No one but Mr. Kirke himself, you mean, Robert," replied the lady, smiling, and
                  then adding:</p>
               <p>"Selly has been in Newbern for a time. Mr. Preston did not expect to find her at
                  home."</p>
               <p>We entered the house, and, taking seats in the drawing room, awaited dinner. We
                  had not been there long before "Master Joe" burst into the apartment,
                  exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"Come, Mr. Kirke, Joe is outside; he wants to see you. Come."</p>
               <p>"Tell Joe to wait. Don't disturb Mr. Kirke now," said his father.</p>
               <p>"Oh! no, Preston; let me see him at once;" and, rising, I followed the lad from
                  the room.</p>
               <p>Joe was a dark-colored mulatto man, about fifty years of age. He was dressed in a
                  suit of "butternut homespun," and held in his hand the ordinary slouched hat worn
                  by the "natives." His hair—the short, crispy wool of the African—was sprinkled
                  with gray, and he had the thick lips and broad, heavy features of his race. Nearly
                  six feet high, he was stoutly and compactly built, and, but for a disproportion in
                  the size of his legs, one of which was smaller and two or three inches shorter
                  than the other, might have rated as a "prime field hand." But a high,
                  well-developed forehead, and a clear, intelligent eye, together with a certain
                  self-possessed manner, indicated that he was more than an ordinary negro.</p>
               <p>"Here, Joe; here's Mr. Kirke. Make your best bow, old fellow," shouted the lad, as
                  he sprang out upon the piazza. Joe, making the requisite bow, said:</p>
               <p>"I'se bery glad ter see you, Mr. Kirke."</p>
               <p>"I'm very glad to see you, Joseph. I feel well acquainted with you," I replied,
                  cordially.</p>
               <p>"I feels well 'quainted wid <emph>you,</emph> sar. I'se wanted ter see you bery
                  much, Mr. Kirke. You'll 'scuse my 'sturbin' you; but de boy"—and he did his hand
                  on the lad's head—"'sisted on my comin' ter onst."</p>
               <p>Before I could reply, his master came out of the house.</p>
               <p>"Welcome home, massa Robert," said the black man, to whom Preston gave his hand,
                  and who then added, in a quick, anxious tone: "What luck in Virginny? Did you do
                  it, massa Robert?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Preston; "I couldn't get a dollar—not a dollar, Joe."</p>
               <p>"I feared dat—I feared dat, massa Robert. Nobody keer nuffin' fur you but ole
                  Joe—nobody but ole Joe, massa Robert!" His eyes moistened, and he spoke in an
                  inexpressibly tender tone—the tone of a mother when speaking to her child.</p>
               <p>"Nobody but Mr. Kirke, Joe. He has paid the judgment!"</p>
               <p>"Bress you, Mr. Kirke! de Lord bress you, sar. But<pb n="108-109"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000055"/> dar's more, you knows, massa Robert. You tole Mr.
                  Kirke 'bout dem?"</p>
               <p>"No, Joe. I should have done it; but I couldn't."</p>
               <p>"P'raps Mr. Kirke wouldn't hab paid dat, if he'd a know'd de whole!" said Joe, in
                  a hesitating tone.</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly I would, Joe. It's no great matter, I'm sure," I replied.</p>
               <p>"Well, Joe, never mind this now. We'll talk affairs all over with Mr. Kirke before
                  he goes," said Preston.</p>
               <p>"Dat's right, massa Robert; gemman like Mr. Kirke knows 'bout dese tings better'n
                  you nor me."</p>
               <p>Preston nodded assent, and we reëntered the mansion</p>

               <p>AFTER dinner, we rode over my friend's plantation. It contained about twelve
                  hundred acres, mainly covered with forest trees, but with here and there an
                  isolated patch of cleared land devoted to corn and cotton. A small tributary of
                  the Trent formed its northern boundary, and bordering the little stream was a
                  tract of three hundred acres of low, swampy ground, heavily timbered with cypress
                  and juniper. Tall old pines, denuded of bark for one third of their height, and
                  their white faces bearded with long, shining flakes of "scrape turpentine,"
                  crowned the uplands; and scattered among them, about a hundred well-clad,
                  "well-kept" negro men and women were shouting pleasantly to one another, or
                  singing merrily some simple song of "Ole Car'lina," as with the long scrapers they
                  peeled the glistening scales from the scarified trees, or, gathering them in their
                  aprons, "dumped" them into the rude barrels prepared for their reception. Preston
                  had a kind word for each one as we passed—a pleasant inquiry about an infirm
                  mother or a sick child, or some encouraging comment on their cheerful work; and
                  many were the hearty blessings they showered upon "good massa," and many their
                  good-natured exclamations over "de strange gemman dat sell massa's truck."</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6528-00000056"/>
               <p>"He'm de kine, 'ou gals," shouted an old darky, bent nearly double with age, who,
                  leaning against one of the barrels, was "packing down" the flakes as they were
                  emptied from the aprons of the women: "He'm de kine, I tell by him eye; de rocks
                  doan't grow fass ter dat gemman's pocket!"</p>
               <p>"Well, they don't, uncle," I replied, tossing him a half-dollar piece, and
                  throwing a handful of smaller coin among the women. A general scramble followed,
                  in which the old fellow nimbly joined, shouting out between his boisterous
                  explosions of merriment:</p>
               <p>"Dis am de sort, massa; dis am manna rainin' in de wilderness—de Lord's chil'ren
                  lub dis kine; it'm good ter take, massa, good ter take."</p>
               <p>"Good as black jack, eh, uncle?" I inquired, laughing, for I saw certain lines
                  about his shrunken mouth, and underneath his sunken eyes, which told plainly he
                  was rather too familiar with that delicious compound of strychnine and
                  whiskey.</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa, good as black Jack; dat's my name, massa, dat's my name—yah! yah!"
                  and he turned his face, wet with merry tears, and distended in an uncommonly broad
                  grin, up to mine. In a moment, however, his eye caught Preston's. His broad visage
                  collapsed, his distended mouth shrank to a very diminutive opening, and his
                  twinkling eyes assumed a peculiarly stolid expression, as he added, in a
                  deprecatory tone:</p>
               <p>"No, massa Robert, I doan't mean black jack—I doan't mean dat; 'ou knows I doan't
                  keer fur him; 'ou knows I doan't knows him no more, massa Robert."</p>
               <p>"I am glad you don't know him," replied Preston, playing on his name. "He's a
                  hardened old sinner. But you know better than to ask presents of strangers. Give
                  it back to the gentleman at once."</p>
               <p>An indescribable expression stole over the old negro's visage as he thrust his
                  hand through his thin, frosty wool, looked pleadingly up in his master's face,
                  and, seeing no signs of relenting there, slowly and reluctantly opened his palm,
                  and tendered me the money.</p>
               <p>"No, no, Preston, let him keep it; it won't do him any harm," I said.</p>
               <p>"No more'n it woan't, good massa—not a morsel ob harm," exclaimed the darky, his
                  small eyes twinkling again with pleasurable anticipation, and his broad face
                  widening into its accustomed grin; "I woan't take nary drop, massa Robert, nary
                  drop."</p>
               <p>"Well," said his master, "you can keep it, if you'll promise not to drink it up
                  to-morrow. So much whiskey would spoil your prayer at the meeting."</p>
               <p>"So it 'ould, massa Robert—so much as dat; but Jack allers prays de stronger fur a
                  little, massa Robert—jess a little; it sort o' 'pears ter warm up de ole man's
                  sperrets, and ter fotch all de 'votion right inter him froat."</p>
               <p>"I suppose it does—all the devotion you ever feel. You're past praying for, I
                  fear, Jack," replied Preston, good-naturedly, turning his horse to go.</p>
               <p>"Not pass prayin' fur 'ou, massa Robert, not pass dat; an' ole Jack neber will be,
                  nudder—not so long as he kin holler loud 'nuff fur de Lord ter yere. 'Ou may 'pend
                  on dat, massa Robert, 'ou may 'pend on dat."</p>
               <p>As we rode away, I asked Preston if the old black led the services at the negro
                  meetings.</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6528-00000057"/>
               <p>"Yes, I am obliged to let him. He was formerly the plantation preacher, and, with
                  all his faults, the blacks are much attached to him. A small rebellion broke out
                  among them, five years ago, when I displaced him, and put Joe into the pulpit. I
                  compromised the difficulty by agreeing that Jack should lead in prayer every
                  Sunday morning. They think he has a gift that way, and <emph>you</emph> would
                  conclude the day of Pentecost had come, if you should hear him when he is about
                  half-seas-over."</p>
               <p>"Then he does pray better for a little whiskey?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; a mug of 'black jack' helps him amazingly."</p>
               <p>After a two hours' circuit of the plantation, we halted in the vicinity of the
                  distilleries, which stood huddled together on the bank of the little stream of
                  which I have spoken. There were three of them, each of thirty barrels' capacity—an
                  enormous size—and they were neatly set in brick, and enclosed in a substantial
                  framed structure, which was weatherboarded, and coated with paint of a dark brown
                  color. Near the only one then in operation were several large heaps of flake
                  turpentine, three or four hundred barrels of rosin, and a vast quantity of the
                  same material scattered loosely about and mixed with broken staves, worn-out
                  strainers, and the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">debris</foreign> of the rosin bins.
                  Pointing to the confused mass, I said to my host:</p>
               <p>"I've half a mind to turn missionary. I feel a sort of call to preach to you
                  Southern heathen."</p>
               <p>"I wish you would," he rejoined; "you'd give me a chance to laugh at your sermons,
                  as you have laughed at mine."</p>
               <p>"No, you wouldn't laugh. I'd make you <emph>feel</emph> way down in your pocket.
                  I'd have but one sermon and one text, and that would be: 'Gather up the fragments,
                  that nothing be lost.' You Southern nabobs do nothing but waste. You waste enough
                  in one day, to feed the whole North for a week. It's a sin—the unpardonable
                  sin—for you know better."</p>
               <p>"Well, it <emph>is</emph> wrong; but how can we help it? We can't make the negroes
                  anything but what they are—shiftless, and careless of everything but their own
                  ease."</p>
               <p>"I don't know about that. I think such a man as Joe ought to be able to manage
                  them."</p>
               <p>"Joe! Well, he can't—he's all drive. And negroes are human beings; they should be
                  treated kindly."</p>
               <p>We had approached the front of the still, and were fastening our horses to the
                  trunk of a tree, when we heard loud voices issuing from the other side of the
                  enclosure.</p>
               <p>"Here'm what I owes you. Now pack off ter onst, and don't neber show your face on
                  dis plantation no more," said a voice, which I at once recognized as that of "boss
                  Joe."</p>
               <p>"I shan't pack off till I'm ready, you d—d black nigger. I've been bossed 'bout by
                  ye long 'nuff. Clar out, and 'tend ter yer own 'fairs," rejoined another voice,
                  which had the tone of a white man's.</p>
               <p>"I reckon <emph>dis</emph> am my 'fair, an' I shan't leff you git drunk, and burn
                  up no more white rosin yere; so take yerself off. Ef you doan't, I'll make you
                  blacker nor I is."</p>
               <p>"Put yer hand on me, and I'll take the law on ye, <emph>shore,</emph>" returned
                  the white man.</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, you drunken fool! does you s'pose dese darkies 'ould tell on me? Ef dey
                  'ould, dar word ain't 'lowed in de law; so you trabble. I doan't keer ter handle
                  you, but I shill, ef you don't leab widin five minutes."</p>
               <pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6528-00000058"/>
               <p>What might have followed will not go down in history, for just then Preston and I,
                  emerging from around the corner of the building, appeared in view of the
                  belligerents. The native—a fair specimen of the class of poor whites—stood in a
                  defiant attitude before the still-fire, while Joe was seated on a turpentine
                  barrel near, quietly noting the time by a large silver watch which he held in his
                  hand. He kept on counting the minutes, and gave no heed to his master's approach,
                  till Preston said:</p>
               <p>"Joe, what's to pay?"</p>
               <p>"Nuffin', massa Robert, 'cept I'se 'scharged dis man, an' he say he won't
                  gwo."</p>
               <p>"Do as Joseph bids you," said Preston, turning to the white man; "take your pay,
                  and go at once."</p>
               <p>The man stammered out a few words with a cringing air, but the planter cut him
                  short, with:</p>
               <p>"I want no explanations. If you can't satisfy Joseph, you can't satisfy me."</p>
               <p>The native then leisurely took down a ragged coat that hung from one of the
                  timbers, counted over a small roll of bank notes which Joe gave him, and meekly
                  left the still-house.</p>
               <p>Joe and his master devoted the next half hour to piloting me over the
                  distilleries. I commented rather freely on the sad waste of valuable produce which
                  was scattered about, and on the bad economy of keeping three "stills" to do the
                  work of one.</p>
               <p>"It might have done years ago," I remarked, "before your trees ran to 'scrape,'
                  and when they yielded enough 'dip' to keep all the stills busy; but now they are
                  eating you up. You have fully four thousand dollars idle here. Sell them,
                  Preston—that amount would help you out of debt."</p>
               <p>"Dat's what I tells massa Robert, Mr. Kirke; but he sort o' clings ter ole tings,
                  sar," said Joe, in the free, familiar tone usual with him.</p>
               <p>"But <emph>you</emph> do just as badly, Joe," I replied. "You let these darkies
                  waste more than they eat, and you keep four here to do the work of three. You are
                  no better than your master."</p>
               <p>"Only haff so good, Mr. Kirke," rejoined the black, showing a set of teeth which a
                  dentist might have used for a door plate; "only <emph>haff</emph> so good, 'case
                  I'se only haff white. But, ef massa Robert 'ould leff me handle de whip, I'd show
                  him suffin'! I reckon de int'rest 'ouldn't be ahind den."</p>
               <p>"Why! don't you let Joe whip the negroes?" I asked Preston.</p>
               <p>"No, not now; I did, till some years ago, when he almost killed one of them, and
                  came near getting me into serious trouble. He could manage them well enough
                  without whiping, if he'd curb his impetuous temper a little."</p>
               <p>"But I does curb it, massa Robert, and it ain't ob no use. Dey knows I
                     <emph>can't</emph> whip 'em, an' dey don't keer fur de starvin', or de tyin'
                  up, or de talkin' to in de meetin'. Dey don't mind fur nuffin' but de whip, an' a
                  little ex'cise wid dat does a nigger good when he'm right down 'fractory. An'
                  you's 'lowed, massa Robert, dat I warn't so much ter blame in dat 'fair ob Black
                  Cale."</p>
               <p>"Well, perhaps you weren't. It's a good story, Kirke; did I ever tell it to
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"No; I'd be glad to hear it."</p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC6528-00000059"/>
               <p>"Come, Joe," said his master, "you can tell it better than I. You know it by
                  heart."</p>
               <p>"Well, massa, ef you says so," replied Joe; and we seated ourselves on some rosin
                  barrels, while the black proceeded to give the following illustration of the
                  working of free and slave institutions:</p>
               <p>"Well, you sees, Mr. Kirke, de darky's name wus Black Cale, an' he wus a raised up
                  'long wid me by de ole gemman—dat am massa Robert's gran'fer. He wus allers a
                  hard-bitted, 'fractory darky, but he wus smart, awful smart, an' 'ould do a heap
                  ob wuck when a minded to; but he wusn't a minded to bery of'en, an' ole master use
                  to hab ter flog him—flog him bery hard. Well, finarly, de ole gemman he grow'd
                  tired ob doin' so much ob dat, an' he call Cale ter him one day, an' he say:</p>
               <p>"'Cale, you'se a likely nigger, an' I <emph>don't</emph> like ter flog you so
                  much. Now, I leff you hire you' time, an' gwo down ter Newbern, an' shirk fur
                  you'seff.'</p>
               <p>"Ole massa know'd Cale wus habin' a bad 'fect on de oder darkies, an' he 'lowed
                  'twould be cheap leffin' him gwo, ef he didn't get a picayune fur him. Well, Cale,
                  he took ter dat ter onst, an' he 'greed to gib ole massa one fifty a year fur his
                  time; an' so he put off ter Newbern. Ebery ting gwo on right smart till de ole
                  gemman die. Cale, he wuck hard, pay massa ebery year, an sabe up quite a heap.
                  Well, ole master die widout a will, an' all de property gwo ter de two sons; dat
                  am massa James an' massa Thomas—he war massa Robert's fader. Now, massa James he
                  neber lib'd on de plantation, so he sold all his haff ob de nigs to massa Thomas,
                  an' put all de 'vails inter his bisness down dar ter Mobile, whar he am now, doin'
                  a heap in de cotton way. But he didn't sell his haff ob Cale, 'case massa Thomas
                  'ouldn't buy him, nohow. Well, dey owned Cale tugedder fur a spell, an' Cale he
                  wuck on right smart, till one day massa James come home, an' he tell massa Thomas
                  dat on de way he'd a stopped at Newbern, an' sole his haff ob Cale ter Cale
                  heseff, fur five hundred dollar, an' giben him de free papers. Well, den Cale he
                  want ter buy de oder haff ob heseff ob massa Thomas, an' massa Thomas he offer ter
                  take de same money; but Cale say de oder haff not wuth so much as de fust, an' dat
                  he 'ouldn't gib only two fifty."</p>
               <p>"Not worth so much! why not?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>"Why, Cale say 'case he could do what he like wid de free haff, an' he reckoned he
                  shouldn't be quite so 'sponsible, den, fur de slave haff," and here Joe broke into
                  a fit of laughter, in which Preston joined.</p>
               <p>"Well, massa Thomas an' Cale couldn't 'gree 'bout de buyin', but Cale promise ter
                  gib seventy-five dollar a yar fur de use ob massa's haff, an' he gwo off agin ter
                  Newbern. Den de time gwo by fur a year or two, but massa neber git nary dime out
                  ob Cale fur his haff. Cale 'ould say dat only haff ob him wus free, an' de oder
                  haff wusn't 'sponsible, an' couldn't pay its debts, nohow. Finarly, massa, seein'
                  he couldn't git nuffin' out ob Cale, only offers ob two fifty fur de oder haff—an'
                     <emph>dat</emph> he 'ouldn't take, nohow—send me down ter Newbern ter sort o'
                  mediate 'tween Cale an' he. Well, I coax Cale ter 'gree ter wuck one monfh fur
                  heseff, an' de oder monfh fur massa, an' I come home; but it warn't ob no use;
                  Cale would wuck, but massa neber seed a fip ob de pay. Finarly, af'er he'd a gone
                  on dat way 'bout ten yar, stowin'<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6528-00000060"/> 'way
                  what he 'arned whar nobody could fine it, an' allers off'rin' two fifty fur de
                  oder haff ob heseff, massa Thomas he die, an' massa Robert he come ter lib on de
                  plantation. Den massa Robert he ax me what he should do wid Cale, an' I tole him
                  to take de two fifty, an' leff him gwo. But he say 'no;' dat he 'ouldn't sell him
                  fur dat, nohow." And here the black looked shyly at his master, and a roguish
                  twinkle came into his eyes. "Well, den, I tole massa Robert dat I tought I could
                  fix Cale, ef he'd leff me manage him jess as I likes. He 'gree ter dat, an' I
                  gwoes down ter Newbern, an' makes Cale come home, an' den I say ter him: 'Now,
                  Cale, you stay yere, an' gwo ter wuck. Ebery monfh you wuck fur me, an' ebery oder
                  monfh you wuck fur you'seff; an' when you wuck fur you'seff, I pay you so much fur
                  ebery barr'l ob dip, an' so much fur ebery barr'l ob scrape, an' so much fur ebery
                  day when you wuck roun'; an' I makes you pay so much fur what you lib on.' Well,
                  Cale, he 'gree ter dat. He wuck de fust monfh fur heseff, an' he <emph>did</emph>
                  wuck—he done twice so much as any hand on de plantation; but de next monfh, when
                  he wuck fur <emph>me,</emph> he don't do nuffin' but lay roun', an' git drunk. I
                  stood dat till de monfh wus up—fur I neber did take ter whippin' de nigs, an'
                  massa Robert know dat—an' den, when Cale wus clean sober, I tied him up ter gib
                  him a floggin'. Well, when he wus a stripped, an' I wus jess gwine ter lay on de
                  lashes, Cale says ter me, says he: 'Look a yere, 'ou Joe; 'ou may whip massa's
                  haff ob dis nig jess so long as 'ou likes; but ef 'ou put de lash onter
                     <emph>my</emph> haff, I'll take de law on 'ou. I will, shore.' Dat sot me a
                  tinkin'; fur de fac' wus, I'd nary right ter flog <emph>his</emph> haff; but den
                  it 'curred ter me dat none but darkies wus roun', an' so I tought I had him,
                     <emph>shore.</emph> Well, I puts on de lashes, an' he keeps a tellin' me he'd
                  hab de law on me, which make me sort ob 'zasparated, till I put 'em on right
                  smart; an' at lass he gib in. Well, when I'd a got him a feelin' 'bout right, an'
                  wus only jess puttin' on de lass blows, ter finish up makin' a decent nigger ob
                  him, massa Robert he come up; and when he seed de blood a runnin' down his back,
                  he say Cale had been whipped 'bout' nuff, an' I must stop. Cale turned up missin'
                  dat night, an' got off ter Newbern; an', shore 'nuff, de next evenin', 'long 'bout
                  dark, de sherrif he rode up ter de house wid a writ fur massa Robert fur habin'
                  made 'salt an' batt'ry on one collud man, called Caleb Preston; an' he pulled out
                  a suspeny dat make massa Robert witness agin heseff—ha! ha! You sees, Cale wus
                  smart; he know'd massa Robert b'long ter de Baptist meetin', an' wouldn't lie fur
                  all de niggers in Jones county; so he had him dar—ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>Here Joe for some minutes was unable to continue the narrative. It was contagious.
                  I laughed till my sides were sore, and Preston enjoyed the story quite as much as
                  I did.</p>
               <p>"Well, what was the end of it?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Only, massa Robert hed to be toted off ter Newbern dat night, git bail, or sleep
                  in de jail, an' de next mornin', af'er de nig hed a hed ten yars' use ob heseff
                  fur nuffin', massa Robert hed to do what <emph>he'd</emph> a said, an' his fader
                  afore him hed said, dey neber would do—dat is, take two fifty fur de oder haff ob
                  Cale—ha! ha! De next time I gwoes ter Newbern I hunt Cale up, an' I tell him he
                  must study fur de law, shore; an' dat ef he done it, I know'd massa Robert would
                  pay de 'spences, out ob lub ter de country."</p>
               <p>The negroes who were attending the still had dropped their<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000061"/> work to listen to Joe's story, and at its close
                  guffawed in a chorus that made the woods ring. Hearing it, Joe sprang to his feet,
                  shouting out: "Yere! 'bout you' wuck, dar. Leff me kotch you eavesdroppin' on
                  gemmen agin, an' I'll gib you what I gabe Cale. 'Bout you' wuck, I say." They
                  turned nimbly to their tasks, and Joe resumed his seat.</p>
               <p>"I see the moral of that story, Preston," I said, when the negro had
                  concluded.</p>
               <p>"What is it?"</p>
               <p>"That a darky may be as smart as a white man. Cale outwitted you."</p>
               <p>"Well, he did," he replied, laughing; "but that isn't the moral: it is, that
                  flogging never accomplishes its object."</p>
               <p>"I'm not so sure of that. Joe had brought Cale to terms—'made a decent nigger on
                  him'—when you, unluckily, interfered."</p>
               <p>"It ain't so much de floggin' on em', Mr. Kirke," said Joe, "as dar knowin' dat
                  you <emph>will</emph> do it, ef dey desarve it. Dar ain't a darky on de plantation
                  dat don't know massa Robert an' de good missus 'ould rader be flogged demselves
                  dan flog dem; an' dat wucks bad, Mr. Kirke, sorry bad;" and the negro shook his
                  head with a grave, thoughtful air.</p>
               <p>"Tell me, Preston," I said, after a slight pause, "how is it that your neighbor
                  Dawsey, with only seventy-five negroes, sends us more produce than you do, with a
                  hundred and fifty?"</p>
               <p>"Simply because he treats his hands like brutes, while I treat mine like men."</p>
               <p>"I hope you'll take no offence," I replied, "but it appears to me there must be
                  some other reason. He has only <emph>half</emph> your number."</p>
               <p>"Well, I will tell you how he and I manage, and you can judge for yourself. Dawsey
                  has seventy-five slaves: forty child-bearing women, twenty men, and fifteen
                  children under five years. The sixty adults are all prime hands. They are given
                  daily tasks, which they cannot possibly do in less than fifteen hours, leaving
                  them only nine hours out of the twenty-four for eating, sleeping, feeding their
                  children, and the waking rest necessary to working people. He never whips them on
                  a week day, because it wastes working time, but makes Sunday a general flogging
                  season. He has two women where he has one man, and each woman is expected to bear
                  a child every second year. If she doesn't, she is sold. They are made to work in
                  the field till the labor pains are on them, and are allowed only two weeks' rest
                  after confinement. Three of them have borne children in the woods, this season. He
                  keeps only one nurse for the fifteen children; and as soon as each child is five
                  years old—the age at whch it can be legally sold away from its mother—it is
                  disposed of to the traders. In addition, three of these women are his mistresses,
                  and they must have children as fast as the others. He serves their children like
                  the rest; that is, rears them to the age of five, and then sells them, as he would
                  so many hogs."</p>
               <p>"My God!" I exclaimed; "he's a monster."</p>
               <p>"There are different opinions about that. Dawsey passes for a jovial, good fellow;
                  keeps open house for his friends; spends money freely at the elections, and, two
                  years ago, 'got religion' at the camp meeting. He merely regards his slaves as
                  chattels, and manages his plantation in perhaps the only way that is profitable in
                  an old section of country like this."</p>
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6528-00000062"/>
               <p>"And how is it with you? How do you manage?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Leff <emph>me</emph> tell, massa Robert," said the black. "I knows all de
                  'ticulars 'bout dat."</p>
               <p>"Go on," said Preston, laughing.</p>
               <p>"We hab," continued the black, "countin' me in, a hundred an' fifty-one darkies,
                  all in fam'lies—faders, mudders, chil'ren, an' some on 'em gran'faders an'
                  gran'mudders; 'most all born on de plantation, an' some on 'em libin' on it fur
                  forty, fifty, sixty, an' seventy yar. Out ob dese, we hab only firty-six full
                  hands, 'case some ob de wimmin dat come in de ages fur full wuck am sickly, puny
                  tings, only fit fur house wuck or nussin'. From de whole, I gits equal ter 'bout
                  fifty full hands. 'Cordin' to massa Robert's direction, I gib 'em easy ten-hour
                  wuck; but suffin' or oder turn up 'most ebery day, so dat 'bout haff on 'em don't
                  do full wuck, an' I reckon dey don't make, on de whole, more'n 'bout nine hour a
                  day. So you see, Cunnel Dawsey, he hab sixty, an' he wuck 'em fifteen hour a day;
                  we hab only fifty, an' we wuck 'em nine hour a day; an', 'cordin' ter my
                  'rithmetic, dat would make de Cunnel turn out 'bout twice as much truck as we
                  does."</p>
               <p>"And you have twice as many mouths to feed as he," I remarked; "and the result is,
                  he makes money, while you——"</p>
               <p>"Lose nigh onter two thousand a yar, Mr. Kirke, an' hab done it ebery yar fur five
                  yar, eber since massa Robert come on ter de plantation, an' gwo ter workin' on
                  human principles, as he call 'em."</p>
               <p>This was said in so sad and regretful a tone, that, in spite of the serious manner
                  of both the black and his master, I could not help laughing.</p>
               <p>"Joe," said I, "what would you do to mend this state of affairs?"</p>
               <p>"It can't be mended, ef we stay in dis ole country, an' wuck 'cordin' ter massa
                  Robert's notion."</p>
               <p>"Then you mean to say you can't apply humane principles to slave labor, in an old
                  district, and make money?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Preston, rising, and pacing up and down in the small semicircle formed
                  by the rosin barrels; "that is what he means to say, and it is true."</p>
               <p>"Then how do the majority of turpentine planters in this section make money? They
                     <emph>do</emph> make it, that is certain."</p>
               <p>"By overworking their hands, as Dawsey does. All may not be as severe with them as
                  he is, but all overwork them, more or less," replied Preston.</p>
               <p>"I don't know 'bout dat, massa Robert; twelve, an' eben firteen hour a day neber
                  hurt a prime hand, ef he hab good feed."</p>
               <p>"Well, it is six o'clock, and supper must be in waiting," said Preston, drawing
                  out his watch; "we'll talk more on this subject to-night. Joe, bring the books up
                  to the house this evening. Mr. Kirke has promised to look into our affairs, and I
                  shall need you."</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa Robert," replied the black; and, mounting our horses, Preston and I
                  rode back to the mansion.</p>

               <p>MRS. PRESTON and master Joe were on the piazza awaiting us, and, in the doorway,
                  we were met by the younger children. Preston lifted one of them upon his shoulder,
                  and, taking another in his arms, led the way to the supper room. However disturbed
                  might be my friend's relations with the outer world, all was peace by his cheerful
                  fireside. No man was ever more blessed in his home. His children were intelligent,
                  loving, and obedient; his wife was one of those rare women—seen nowhere more often
                  than in the South—who, to a cultivated mind and polished manners, add the more
                  homely accomplishments of a good housewife. It is years since she laid aside the
                  weary cares of her plantation home, and entered on the higher duties of another
                  life; but her kindly image is still as fresh in my memory as on that autumn day,
                  when she placed her hand in mine for the last time, and spoke the last "God bless
                  you" which I was to hear from her lips on this side of the grave. She was a
                  perfect woman—a faithful mistress, a loving wife, a devoted mother. Anticipating
                  every want of her husband, carefully instructing her children, overseeing every
                  detail of her household, meting out the weekly allowance of the negroes, visiting
                  daily the cabins of the sick and the infirm, and with her own hand dispensing the
                  soothing cordial or the healing medicine,—or, when all medicine failed, bending
                  over the lowly bed of the dying, and pointing him to the "better home on
                  high,"—she was a ministering angel—a joy and a blessing to all about her. She wore
                  no costly silks, no diamonds on her fingers, or jewels in her hair; but she was
                  arrayed in garments all rich and beautiful with human love. She knew
                  nothing—thought nothing—about the right or the wrong of slavery; but, cheerfully
                  and prayerfully, never wearying and never doubting, she went on in the round of
                  duties allotted her, leaning on the arm of the GOOD ALL-FATHER, and looking
                  steadfastly to HIM for guidance and support. And, truly, she had her reward. "Her
                  children rose up and called her blessed; her husband, also, and he praised
                  her."</p>
               <p>Supper was soon over, when my hostess rose, and conducted me to the library. That
                  apartment was in a wing communicating with the mansion by a covered passage way.
                  It was plainly furnished, but had a cosy, homelike appearance. Its four walls were
                  lined with books, some standing on end, some resting on their sides, and some
                  leaning negligently against each other; and on the massive centre table, open
                  volumes, old newspapers, and unfinished manuscripts were littered, in most
                  delightful confusion. A half dozen old-fashioned chairs straggled about the floor,
                  as if they did not know exactly what to do with themselves, and a score of old
                  worthies, their faces white as chalk, and their long hair and beards powdered with
                  a whole generation of dust, looked complacently down from the top of the
                  bookshelves. Dust was on the table, on the chairs, on the<pb n="126-127"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000064"/> floor, on the ceiling, and on the musty old volumes
                  ranged along the walls, and dust everywhere told unmistakably that no profane hand
                  ever disturbed the dusty repose which reigned in the apartment.</p>
               <p>Two or three oaken logs, supported on bright brass and irons—the only bright
                  things in the room—were blazing cheerfully on the broad hearthstone; and, drawing
                  our chairs near, we sat down before them.</p>
               <p>"May I come in?" said master Joe, thrusting his head in at the half-closed
                  doorway.</p>
               <p>"No, my son," answered his father; "Mr. Kirke and I are to talk over business
                  matters."</p>
               <p>"Do let him come, Robert," said Mrs. Preston; "he is old enough to learn something
                  of such affairs."</p>
               <p>The lad entered, and, seating himself on a low stool by the side of his mother,
                  and burying his head in her lap, was soon fast asleep.</p>
               <p>"This room, Mr. Kirke," said the lady, "is sacred to Robert and the dust. I beg
                  you will not think I have the care of it."</p>
               <p>"Oh no, madam; it is plain that a <emph>man</emph> has exclusive dominion here.
                  But your husband has been away for some time."</p>
               <p>"That does not account for the dust; it hasn't been stirred for a twelvemonth;"
                  and, after a pause, she added, a thin moisture glistening in her eyes, "I have not
                  yet thanked you, sir, for saving Phyllis and the children from the clutches of
                  that wretched trader."</p>
               <p>"No thanks are requisite, madam. It was a mere matter of business; we are in the
                  practice of making advances to our consignors."</p>
               <p>"Nevertheless we thank you, sir; Robert and I will ever be grateful for it."</p>
               <p>"Do not speak of it, madam; I would be glad to serve you to a much greater
                  extent."</p>
               <p>The lady made no reply, and a rather embarrassing silence followed for some
                  minutes, when I said:</p>
               <p>"Preston, Joe is a remarkable negro; I think I never met one so intelligent and
                  well informed."</p>
               <p>"He <emph>is</emph> very intelligent," he replied; "he has fine natural
                  abilities."</p>
               <p>"It is a pity Nature gave him so dark a skin, and made him a—slave."</p>
               <p>"Not a <emph>pity,</emph> Mr. Kirke," rejoined Mrs. Preston; "Nature, or rather
                  God, always puts us in our right places. Joseph is more useful where he is, than
                  he would be anywhere else."</p>
               <p>"I understood him that he was raised on the plantation," I added.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied my host; "my grandfather bought his mother when she was a girl. She
                  was a favorite house-servant, and Joe was born in a room over where we are
                  sitting. This building was then all there was of the mansion."</p>
               <p>"And how did he pick up so much information?"</p>
               <p>"The old gentleman, who gave little heed to either law or gospel, taught them both
                  to read and write." [Years after the date of this conversation, I learned that Joe
                  was the son of that lawless, graceless old gentleman.] "And Joe, when a boy, read
                  everything he could lay his hands on. Since I have brought my library here, he has
                  devoured about half of the books in it. He devotes every night, from eight o'clock
                  to twelve, to reading."</p>
               <pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC6528-00000065"/>
               <p>"I am surprised, that, with so much reading, he uses so entirely the negro
                  dialect."</p>
               <p>"But he does not. In common conversation he expresses himself in it, for it is the
                  dialect in which a black does his ordinary thinking; but let him get upon an
                  elevated subject, as he frequently does in his sermons, and you will hear words as
                  strong, pure, and simple as any found in the Bible, flow from him like a
                  stream."</p>
               <p>"Does he preach every Sunday?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I usually catechize the people in the evening, and he preaches in the
                  morning."</p>
               <p>"But do you learn all your negroes to read?"</p>
               <p>"No, the law does not allow it. I teach them to repeat the catechism, texts of
                  Scripture, and passages from good books, and I explain these to them."</p>
               <p>"And Joe is your overseer?"</p>
               <p>"Not exactly that. My father made him overseer about thirty years ago, but the law
                  requires a white man in that situation; and when I took charge of the plantation,
                  the neighbors made a clamor about my having a black. The result was, I 'whipped
                  the devil round the stump,' by hiring a white distiller, and <emph>calling</emph>
                  him 'overseer.' I let Joe, however, 'oversee' him, as you have seen to-day."</p>
               <p>A rap came then at the door, and master Joe, waking up, ushered the subject of our
                  conversation into the room. He held his hat in his hand, and had under his arm a
                  couple of account books.</p>
               <p>"This is Joseph the First," said the lad, taking the black by the coat-tail, and
                  bowing gravely to me.</p>
               <p>"And you are Joseph the Second, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, sar; he'm dat 'stinguished gemman," replied the negro, stroking
                  affectionately the lad's head; "an' he don't dishonor de name, sar. He'm de true
                  blue, dyed in de wool."</p>
               <p>"Bring up a chair, Joseph," said the lady, smiling kindly on the black.</p>
               <p>"Tank you, missus;" and the negro seated himself by the fire, between Preston and
                  me.</p>
               <p>"You have brought the documents, I see, Joe; let me look at them," I said,
                  reaching out my hand for the books.</p>
               <p>"Yas, sar; an' dey'm all written up ter a week back. I reckon <emph>you</emph> kin
                  pick 'em out, Mr. Kirke, dough massa Robert he say he don't understand my way ob
                  keepin' em."</p>
               <p>I opened the books, and any man of business will appreciate my surprise to find
                  they were kept by "double entry." Cotton, corn, and turpentine had each its
                  separate account, and at a glance I could see how much had been made or lost in
                  the production of each staple. The handwriting was plain and bold, and the general
                  appearance of the ledger compared favorably with that of a much larger one I knew
                  of, which was the pride of an experienced bookkeeper.</p>
               <p>"Why, Joe, I'm astonished!" I exclaimed, with unaffected gratification; "you write
                  like a schoolmaster."</p>
               <p>A flush, which would have been a blush on a lighter skin, overspread the negro's
                  face, as he replied:</p>
               <p>"I don't hab practice 'nuff, Mr. Kirke, ter write bery well."</p>
               <p>"Practice!" said Preston; "he has constant practice; he writes the love letters of
                  all the darkies in the district."</p>
               <p>"It am so, dat's a fac', sar," said Joe, a quiet humor twinkling in his eye. "One
                  ob Cunnel Dawsey's folk come ter me<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6528-00000066"/> ter

                  up 'pletely—not 'xactly 'cluded; so he 'sisted I muss 'sert a pose scrip, axin'
                  har ter 'scuse de bad writin'."</p>
               <p>"And you did it?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, sar, I done it."</p>
               <p>"Well, Joe, the important thing just now is, how much you owe. Give me a slip of
                  paper, and let me put these balances together."</p>
               <p>"I'se done dat, Mr. Kirke; here dey am," and he handed me a correctly drawn-up
                  statement, showing Preston's exact liabilities. I glanced over it, compared it
                  with the footings in the ledger, and said:</p>
               <p>"I see by this, Preston, that you owe seventeen hundred dollars, floating debt;
                  twelve hundred dollars, interest on your mortgage; and are overdrawn five hundred
                  dollars on our house."</p>
               <p>"Yes, so Joe makes it, and I reckon he's correct."</p>
               <p>"But dar'm de six hunderd you 'cepted fur massa Robert, de oder day, in Newbern;
                  dat ain't counted in," said Joe.</p>
               <p>"Well, all told, it's four thousand, besides the note I have given for Phyllis.
                  What do you calculate on to pay it, Preston?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know. How can we pay it, Joe?"</p>
               <p>"We moight sell de two stills, an' some ob de hosses; I reckon dey'd be 'nuff,"
                  replied the black; "but de raal trubble, massa Robert, am what's comin'; we'm
                  gwine ahind ebery day, 'case we lose money on ebery crop ob turpentine. Nuffin'
                  pay now but de corn an' de cotton, an' we don't raise 'nuff ob dem ter do no
                  good."</p>
               <p>I turned to the ledger, and found it showed what the black said to be true—corn
                  and cotton had made a handsome profit, but turpentine had "paid a loss."</p>
               <p>"That is because your trees are old, and now yield little of anything but
                     scrape,"<ref rend="super" target="#note_001" xml:id="return_001">*</ref>

                  <p><ref target="#return_001">*</ref>'Scrape' is the turpentine gathered from the face of the pine. On old trees,
                     the yearly incision is made high above the boxes, and the sap, in flowing
                     down, passes over and adheres to the previously scarified surface. It is
                     thus exposed to the sun, which evaporates the more volatile and valuable
                     portion, and leaves only the hard, which, when manufactured, is mostly
                     rosin. "Scrape" turpentine is only about half as valuable as "dip."</p>

               <p>"Why not drop turpentine, and cut shingles from the swamp? You've a fortune in
                  those cypress trees."</p>
               <p>"My negroes are not accustomed to swamp work—it would kill them," replied
                  Preston.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Kirke," said Joe,—"you'll take no 'fence, massa Robert, ef I says dis?"</p>
               <p>"No; go on," said his master.</p>
               <p>"De ting am right in a nutshell, an' jess so clar as apple jack: we owes a heap;

               <p>Avoiding the darky's question, I said: "I never before understood why slavery is
                  so clamorous for new fields. I see, now—it can draw support only from the virgin
                  soil. It exhausts an old country. Like the locusts of Egypt, it eats up the very
                  face of the earth!"</p>
               <p>"That is true," replied Preston; "but Joe has stated the case correctly. What
                  shall we do?"</p>
               <p>"One of two things: sell your plantation and negroes, or take your hands to a new

               <p>"I cannot sell my negroes—they were all raised with me; and the plantation—it was
                  my ancestors', over a hundred years ago. I would move my hands to a new section,
                  but I have not the means to buy land."</p>
               <p>"Ay, dar's de rub," said Joe.</p>
               <p>"If you could satisfy your outside creditors that things were likely to go better
                  with you in future, could you put them off for a time?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"I reckon I could—nearly all of them," replied Preston.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I'll make you a proposition. Buy ten thousand acres on the line of
                  the Manchester railroad. It is finished to Whitesville, and you can buy land
                  within twenty miles of that station, at seventy-five cents an acre. We'll advance
                  the twenty per cent, you'll have to pay down, and five hundred dollars more to
                  start you there, and hold the deed of the land to secure us. Ship your produce to
                  us, and agree to forfeit the land, if, at the end of three years, you have not
                  paid all the original advance. Move your stills, and your able-bodied men and
                  women there, leaving the old and the young negroes here to raise corn and cotton.
                  Hire fifty more prime hands, and put Joe over the whole, with unlimited power to
                  work them to death, if he pleases."</p>
               <p>Preston leaned his head on his hand, as if bewildered—he seemed not to understand
                  me; but Joe's face lighted as if a stream of electricity were playing under his
                  dark skin. Mrs. Preston was the first to speak.</p>
               <p>"Robert will do it, Mr. Kirke; and how can we ever thank you enough for your
                  generous conduct toward us? You have taken a weary load off our hearts."</p>
               <p>"It is a simple business transaction, madam; I expect to make money by it. Your
                  husband is to consign his produce to us, and I shall require the forfeit of the
                  land and the improvements, if he does not pay our advances within three
                  years."</p>
               <p>"We kin pay 'em in <emph>one</emph> yar, an' you knows it, sar!" exclaimed Joe,
                  springing to his feet, and almost dancing around the room. "Come, massa Robert,
                  look up, an' tell 'im we'll do it, fur ole Joe'll make de chips fly as you neber
                  seed afore."</p>
               <p>Preston looked up, as he said: "My friend, I thank you."</p>
               <p>"You need not say <emph>that;</emph> only buy the land, and make Joe autocrat of
                  the new plantation, and your bacon is cured."</p>
               <p>"Joe'll show you how bacon am cured, Mr. Kirke; an' he'll name his fuss boy af'er
                  you, <emph>shore!</emph>" shouted the black, grinning all over.</p>
               <p>"He can safely promise that," said the lady, laughing through her tears; "for Aggy
                  is fifty, and never had a child."</p>
               <p>A half-hour's conversation over the details of the proposed<pb n="134-135"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000068"/> arrangement followed; then Joe rose, and, taking
                  the account books under his arm, bade us "good evenin'." As he was leaving the
                  room, I asked: "Do you preach to-morrow?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, sar; an' I'se gwine home ter study ober de sermon. You'll come dar, sar? You
                  won't yere no raal preachin', 'less massa Robert feels de sperrit move, fur de
                  Lord don't gib de brack man de tongue He gib de white."</p>
               <p>"I'm not sure of that; but I'll be there. Good night."</p>
               <p>"Good night, sar, an' de Lord bless you."</p>
               <p>When he had gone, I said to Preston: "You have admitted me to your confidence, and
                  asked my advice; therefore, I think you'll pardon me, if I make you a few business
                  suggestions."</p>
               <p>"Most certainly; and I shall be guided by them."</p>
               <p>"With a hundred hands in those thick woods, Joe will turn out a vast amount of
                  produce. His ambition is excited with the idea of being his own master, and he
                  will coin money for you; but you need to be prudent. You owe a mortgage of twenty
                  thousand dollars—and mortgage debts are the worst in the world. Your plantation
                  and negroes may be worth three times the amount, but they are in jeopardy so long
                  as it exists. If it were called in suddenly, you couldn't pay it; your property
                  would be sacrificed—everything might be lost. Now I would suggest that you sell,
                  at once, your three hundred acres of swamp land, all your surplus live stock and
                  materials, and appropriate the proceeds to paying your floating debt, and reducing
                  the mortgage."</p>
               <p>"And we might reduce our family expenses, Robert," said his wife; "we have too
                  many house-servants. We could hire out five or six of them in Newbern. And
                  Joseph's schooling costs us five hundred dollars a year; he might come
                     home—<emph>I</emph> could teach him."</p>
               <p>"You would take too much on yourself, Lucy," replied her husband. "You are not
                  strong, and you can't spare a single servant."</p>
               <p>"How many have you?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Nine," said Preston.</p>
               <p>"For a family of two adults and three children?'</p>
               <p>"It strikes you as too many, Mr. Kirke," said the lady, "and it is. It is our
                  Southern way; but every additional servant makes additional work for the
                  mistress."</p>
               <p>"I think you are right, madam," I replied. "A Northern lady that you know of,
                  takes care of me, Frank, the two young children, and a large house, with only two
                  servants and an errand boy; and she never has anything to do after two
                  o'clock."</p>
               <p>"But you have the Irish; they are better house-servants than our blacks; and you
                  can discharge them, if they won't work," said Preston.</p>
               <p>"I would rather have Phyllis, than any servant I ever saw at the North. With her,
                  the cook, and one more, I will promise to get on beautifully," remarked his
                  wife.</p>
               <p>Preston's voice quivered, as he replied: "Do as you think best."</p>
               <p>"But, madam," I said, "I think you are really taking too much on yourself; the
                  care of the children will be a great tax on your strength. Would it not be better
                  to employ a governess to instruct them? What is now expended on Joe, would pay a
                  competent person."</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6528-00000069"/>
               <p>"What do you say to that, Joe?" asked his father; "would you like to come home,
                  and have a woman teacher?"</p>
               <p>"I'd like to do what mother wants me to," said the lad, putting his arms about her
                  neck, and kissing her.</p>
               <p>"You're a good boy, Joe," said his mother.</p>
               <p>"But you'll let me keep the pony, won't you, father?" said the lad.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my son; and if you learn well, you shall go with uncle James when you're
                  fifteen."</p>
               <p>Shortly afterward, we separated for the night.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE NEGRO MEETING.</head>
               <p>ON a gentle knoll, a few hundred yards from the negro quarters, and in the midst
                  of a grove of pines, whose soft brown tassels covered the ground all around it,
                  stood the negro meeting house. It was built of unhewn logs, its crevices chinked
                  with clay, and was large enough to seat about two hundred persons. Though its
                  exterior resembled a backwoods barn, its interior had a neat and tasteful
                  appearance. Evergreen boughs hid its rough beams and bare shingled roof, and long
                  wreaths of pine leaves hung in graceful festoons from its naked walls and narrow
                  windows. On the two sides of a wide aisle, which served to separate the sheep on
                  the right hand from the goats on the left, were long rows of benches, with hard
                  board bottoms, and rough, open backs; and beyond them, divided from the rest of
                  the interior by a rustic railing, was the "family pew"—an enclosure about twelve
                  feet square, neatly carpeted, and furnished with half a dozen arm chairs. Opposite
                  to this was a platform elevated three steps from the floor, and on it stood a
                  rustic settee, a large easy chair, and a modest desk covered with green baize, and
                  decorated with small sprigs of evergreen. On this desk rested a large Bible.</p>
               <p>The enormous seashell which served as a bell to this "house<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000070"/> of prayer," was sending its last blast in long
                  echoes through the old trees, when, with Mrs. Preston and the children, I elbowed
                  an opening through the thick group of grinning Africans that blocked the doorway,
                  and worked a passage down the crowded aisle to the family enclosure. Seating
                  myself in one of its cane-bottomed chairs, I glanced around on the assemblage.
                  Such a gathering of woolly heads I had never seen. Every plantation within a
                  circuit of five miles had sent in a representation, till the benches, the aisle,
                  the small area around the pulpit, and the open space near the doorway were all
                  densely packed. On the left, the men, in gaudy cravats and many-colored
                  waistcoats, were chatting merrily together, and enjoying themselves as heartily as
                  a parcel of Yankees at a clam-bake; and on the right, the women, in red and yellow
                  turbans, and flaming shawls and neckerchiefs, were bobbing about and flaunting
                  their colors, like so many dolphins sporting in the sunshine. Preston was seated
                  in the lone chair at the back of the pulpit, and Boss Joe and Black Jack occupied
                  the settee near him. The latter shortly rose to open the services, and, in a
                  moment, a deep silence fell on the noisy multitude. The old preacher had carefully
                  combed his thin wool into a pyramid on the top of his head, and he looked—dressed
                  in glossy black pants, long-tailed blue coat, ruffled shirt, and high shirt
                  collar—like a stuffed effigy at an exhibition of wax figures. Stepping rather
                  unsteadily to the front of the platform, he flourished his red cotton bandanna,
                  and, spreading his huge claws over the large Bible, said:</p>
               <p>"Dear bred'rin, leff us begin de worship ob de Lord, by singin': <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'From all dat dwell below de skies,</l>
                        <l>Leff de Creator's praise arise.'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A half dozen darky fiddlers at the left of the pulpit tuned their strings, and
                  then the whole assemblage rose, and burst into that grand old hymn. As its last
                  echoes came back from the old woods, and died away among the rafters of the little
                  church, Joe got up, and, opening the large Bible, read, in a clear, mellow voice,
                  a portion of the one hundred and nineteenth Psalm. Then the old darky again came
                  forward.</p>
               <p>Gazing complacently around on the audience for a moment, he drawled out: "My
                  bred'rin, leff us raise our hearts ter de Lord." The whole congregation then
                  kneeled, and Jack, closing his eyes, clenching his hands together, and throwing
                  his head back, until his nose came nearly on a line with the roof of the building,
                  "lifted up his voice" and prayed.</p>
               <p>After the fashion of very many white preachers, he began by telling the Lord all
                  about Himself; all He had ever done, and all He is going to do; how long He had
                  lived, and how long He is going to live; how great He is—"taller dan de mountins,
                  an' bigger dan de seas;" how He made the world in six days, and then, "gittin'
                  tired, rested on de sevenfh;" how he formed man out of the dust of the ground, and
                  then, out of his rib, formed woman; how the woman tempted the man, and he fell,
                  and how woman has raised Cain on the earth ever since; how He sent the flood, and
                  how Noah builded the ark; how Noah axed all the wild critters into it, and how
                  they all came in two by two, and how Noah and the wild beasts lay down lovingly
                  together, till the wet spell was over; how Moses, when he came down from the
                  mount, "stumbled, and broke de law; an' how ebery one ob us dat hab come inter de
                  worle sence, hab stumbled, an' broke de law, 'case he did;" how Noah, though he
                  was a white man, and had a white wife,<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC6528-00000071"/>
                  begat a black son; and how that black son was a great sinner, and how all his
                  descendants have taken after him, and been mighty big sinners ever since.</p>
               <p>Then he described the sinners, particularly the black sinners present; and if half
                  of what he said was true, every one of them deserved to be sold "down Soufh," and
                  kept on cold hominy and hoecake all the rest of his days.</p>
               <p>The prayer was a strange medley of absurdity, presumption, and profanity, and I
                  felt relieved to hear his long "amen," and to see Joe rise, and again approach the
                  pulpit.</p>
               <p>Requesting some one present to raise a few of the windows (I took occasion,
                  afterward, to thank him for that very considerate action), Joe opened the Bible,
                  and said: "My friends, I am gwine ter talk ter you from de tex, 'An' dey drew an'
                  lifted up Joseph out ob de pit, an' sold Joseph to de Ishmaelites fur twenty
                  pieces ob silver; an' dey brought Joseph inter Egypt.'</p>
               <p>"You all knows," he continued, "de story ob Joseph an' his bred'rin; how dey wus
                  raised up by dar fader Jacob in a wile country, whar dar warn't no schools, an' no
                  'telligence, an' no larnin'; an' how his fader lub'd Joseph more dan all ob his
                  bred'rin, an' made fur him a coat ob many colors. But p'raps you don't know dat de
                  Lord lub Joseph a great sight better'n his fader did, an' 'case He lub him so, dat
                  He harden de hearts ob his bred'rin agin him, till dey sole him ter de
                  Ishmaelites—de slave-traders ob dem days—ter be taken down inter Egypt. An' p'raps
                  you don't know dat Egypt wus a great country, whar dar wus schools, an' churches,
                  an' great libraries ob books, an' all manner ob sciences; an' dat Joseph wus made
                  de lord ob all dat country, an' dat finarly he got his fader, an' his bred'rin,
                  an' dar wifes, an' all dar little ones, ter come down dar, an' stay; whar, dough

                  dey could git knowledge an' larnin'. An' p'raps, too, you don't know dat de

                  stayed down dar in Egypt de 'pointed time, war taken by de Lord inter de lan' ob
                  Canaan, which wus a lan' 'flowin' wid milk an' honey;' an' dat dey war gib'n dat
                  lan' fur dar possession. Now, my friends," and he paused, and looked around on the
                  congregation, "de story ob Joseph am de story ob de brack man: <emph>he</emph> hab
                  been taken out ob de pit; <emph>he</emph> hab been sole fur twenty pieces ob

                  No, my friends; 'tain't no lan' like dat! It am de habitation on high, de city

                  stars. His face wus dazzlin' as de sun, an' his eyes war like flamin' fire. He
                  look at me, an' he say: 'Joseph, come up hither!' He reach out his han', an' he
                  lift me up— above de 'arth—above de clouds—above de stars—'way up ter de high
                  heabens, whar am de sperrits ob just men made perfect, who hab been redeemed from
                  among men, who hab gone fru great tribulation, whose garments hab been washed
                  clean in de blood ob de Lamb! 'Dis,' he say, 'am de city ob de libin' God, de
                  heabenly Jerusalem, whose foundations am saffomires, whose walls am silver, whose
                  streets am gole, whose housen am jewels an' all precious stones! Yere de sun neber

                  wuck on de 'arth am ober!'"</p>
               <p>The speaker had been gradually warming with his subject, till he uttered this last
                  sentence, when his voice trembled, his face glowed, and his upturned eye seemed
                  fixed on the ineffable glories of the land he was describing. A stillness like
                  that of death fell on the assemblage, and the simple blacks, hanging breathlessly
                  on his words, looked up to where Joe's hand was pointing, as if they, too, had
                  caught the vision on which his eyes were gazing. In a moment, he continued:</p>
               <p>"I looked roun', an' I seed dat beautiful city; I breafed its air; I walked its
                  streets; I hard its music—de neber-endin' song which its countless people send up
                  ter de throne ob de Great Fader; an' I say ter de angel: 'Do brack folks lib yere?
                  Kin <emph>dey</emph> come ter dis beautiful country?' An' he say: 'You shill see.'
                  Den he lead me fru dose shinin' streets, out inter de open fiel's, whar war
                  pleasant pasters, greener dan any on de 'arth, an' still waters, dat sparkle in de
                  sun jess like missus' diamonds in de light ob de fire." (I did not know that Mrs.
                  Preston wore diamonds; she certainly had not worn them in my presence.) "He lead
                  me out, till we come ter a great<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6528-00000073"/> woods,
                  whar fountins war playin', an' birds war singin', an' flowers war growin', an' de
                  air wus full ob fragrance; an' dar I seed a great crowd ob people gadered togeder,
                  a listenin' ter one dat wus a talkin' ter 'em. Dar wus Abr'am, an' Isaac, an'
                  Jacob; dar wus Moses, an' Joseph, an' Samuel; dar wus David, an' Solomon, an' de
                  prophets; dar wus Paul, an' John, an' Peter; dar wus 'most all de great an' good
                  men who hab lib'd in de worle; an' dar, too, right aside ob de one dat wus a
                  speakin', wus de blessed Saviour, wid de woun' in his side, an' de print ob de
                  nails in his hands. An' who do you tink wus a talkin', dar, ter all dem great
                  people? Who do you tink wus fought good 'nuff ter stan' by de side ob de blessed
                  Saviour? It wus a brack man! It wus a brack man, who, down yere, had been ole, an'
                  lame, an' blin', an' ob no account—so no account, he wouldn't sell fur nuffin'. He
                  wus tellin' dem great folks ob de great lub ob de Lord ter him, an' dar tears
                  rolled down as dey hard him. He tole 'em how he use' ter lib in Car'lina; how he
                  wus a slave; how he'd 'most nuffin' ter eat; how he wus wucked in de swamp; how,
                  'fore de sun rose, an' 'way inter de night, he use' ter stan' in de mud an' de
                  water, till his bones war sore, his heart wus weary, his soul wus faint; how his
                  massa flog him, 'case he couldn't wuck no more, till de blood run down his back,
                  an' it wus a ridged like de ploughed groun'; how his wife wus whipped ter death
                  afore his bery eyes; how his chil'ren—all 'cept one—war sole 'way from him; how
                  dat one 'bused him, an' flogged him, an' tormented him, till he wus jess ready ter
                  die; how, when his hair wus white, his body wus bent, his strength wus gone, an'
                  he wus ole, an' lame, an' blin', his massa drove him 'way, and make him shirk fur
                  himseff; how he beg in de roads; how he sleep in de woods, in de cole an' de rain,
                  till a good gemman take him in, gib him a bed, 'tend ter his wants, an' pray ober
                  him when he die. He tole 'em all dat; but he say, dat fru it all, he hab peace;
                  fru it all, de Lord wus good ter him; fru it all, he felt His lub in his heart;
                  fru it all, de blessed Redeemer wus wid him; fru it all, he knowed dat mercy an'
                  salvation am in de heabens! An' DEY AM DAR! Dey took him 'way—'way from de
                  'arth—'way from his suff'rin's an' his sorrers down yere, ter joy, an' peace, an'
                  rest up dar—up dar, whar all great an' good men call him brudder; whar de Lord
                  Jehobah call him son, an' whar de blessed Saviour will leff him stan' at his right
                  han', foreber an' eber. An' he, my friends, wus a BRACK MAN! An' who do you s'pose
                  he wus? Who do you s'pose he wus?"</p>
               <p>He paused for a moment, as he repeated the question, and then, in a slow,
                  impressive manner, continued:</p>
               <p>"It wus ole Cale—Cunnel Dawsey's Cale; an' dat good gemman dat take him in, an'
                  pray ober him when he die, wus <emph>my</emph> massa. Yas, bless de Lord, it wus
                  MY massa!"</p>
               <p>As Joe uttered these last words, Preston bowed his head, his wife sobbed aloud,
                  and the black people gave out a low cry, as sad as the wail which their own
                  mourners breathe over the dead. Fixing his eyes on a tall, stalwart negro in the
                  audience, the preacher continued:</p>
               <p>"An' he wus <emph>you</emph>' fader, Jake!—you' fader, who, when he wus down yere,
                  you 'bused, an' persecuted, an' treated like a dog, but who; up dar, am fought
                  worthy ter stan' at de Saviour's right han'! I <emph>knows</emph> it wus him, fur
                  I seed him, I talked wid him, an' he gabe me suffin' ter tell you. Stan' up, now,
                  an' yere what he had ter say."</p>
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC6528-00000074"/>
               <p>The black man's face assumed a dogged expression. He moved uneasily on his seat,
                  but showed no inclination to rise. In a firm, imperious tone, Joe again called out
                  to him:</p>
               <p>"Stan' up, I say! Folks like you' fader am now, don't talk ter sech as you is when
                  dey'm sittin' down. Stan' up, or I'll gib you what Cunnel Dawsey neber gabe you in
                  all you' life."</p>
               <p>The negro reluctantly rose. Every eye was fixed upon him, as Joe continued:</p>
               <p>"He ax me ter say ter you, Jake, dat he lubs you—lubs you bery much; dat he fully
                  an' freely furgibs you fur all de wrong you eber done him—fur all de tears an' de
                  sorrer you eber cause him. An' he say ter me: 'Tell Jake dat I'se been down dar,
                  an' seed him. I'se seed how he shirk his wuck; how he 'buse his wife an' chil'ren;
                  how he hate his massa, an' mean ter kill him—(dough his massa am hard on him,
                  'tain't no 'scuse fur dat); how he swar, an' lie, an' steal, an' teach all de oder
                  brack folks ter do de same; how he'm no fought ob his soul, no fought ob dyin', no
                  fought ob whar he'm gwine when de Lord's patience am clean done gone wid him. Tell
                  him, dat ef he gwo on dis way, he'll neber see his ole fader no more; neber see
                  his ole mudder, an' his little brudders, who am up yere, no more; neber come ter
                  dis fine country, but be shet out inter outer darkness, whar am weepin', an'
                  wailin', an' knashin' ob teeth. Oh! tell him dis, an' 'treat him, by all his
                  fader's keer fur him when he wus a chile; by all his lub fur him now; by all de
                  goodness ob de Lord, who hab borne wid him fru all dese long years, ter turn
                  roun'—ter turn roun', NOW, an' sot his face toward dis blessed country, whar he
                  kin hab joy foreber! Tell him, too, dat ef he'll do dis, his ole fader'll leab his

                  ebery load; gib him strength when he'm weak; hole up his feet when he'm weary;
                  watch ober him day an' night, all de time, till he'm ready ter come up yere, an'
                  lib wid de Saviour foreber! Tell him——"</p>
               <p>Joe paused, for a wild cry echoed through the building, and the negro fell in
                  strong convulsions to the floor.</p>
               <p>A scene of indescribable excitement and confusion followed, during which the black
                  was carried out, and, more dead than alive, laid upon the ground. When quiet was
                  somewhat restored, Preston made a short and feeling prayer; and then, after giving
                  out a hymn, he dismissed the congregation with the usual benediction.</p>

               <head type="sub">BLACK CLAIRVOYANCE.</head>
               <p>THE afternoon exercises at the meeting house were conducted by Preston, who
                  publicly catechized the negroes very much in the manner that is practised in
                  Northern Sunday schools. When the services were over, and the family had gathered
                  around the supper table, I said to him:</p>
               <p>"I've an idea of passing the evening with Joe; he has invited me. Would it be
                  proper for you and Mrs. Preston to go?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes; and we will. I would like to have you see his mother. She is a singular
                  woman, and, if in the mood, will interest you."</p>
               <p>"I think you told me she is a native African?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; she was brought from Africa when a child. She has a dim recollection of her
                  life there, and retains the language and superstitions of her race," replied
                  Preston, rising from the table. "I think you had better go at once, for she
                  retires early. Lucy and I will follow as soon as we can."</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Joe's cabin was located nearly in the centre of the little collection of negro
                  houses, and a few hundred yards from the mansion. It was of logs, a story and a
                  half high, and had originally been only about twenty feet square. To the primitive
                  structure, however, an addition of the same dimensions had been made, and,
                  stretching for more than forty feet along the narrow bypath which separated the
                  two rows of negro shanties, it then presented quite an imposing appearance. A
                  second addition in the rear, though it did not increase its dignity in the eyes of
                  "street" observers, added largely to its proportions and convenience.</p>
               <p>The various epochs in Joe's history were plainly written on his dwelling. The
                  original building noted the time when, a common field hand, he married a wife, and
                  set up housekeeping; the front addition marked the era when his industry,
                  intelligence, and devotion to his master's interest raised him above the dead
                  level of black servitude, and gave him the management of the plantation; and the
                  rear structure spoke pleasantly of a later period, when old Deborah, disabled by
                  age from longer service at "the great house," and too infirm to clamber up the
                  steep ladder leading to Joe's attic bedrooms, came to doze away the remainder of
                  her days under her son's roof.</p>
               <p>The cabin was furnished with two entrance doors, and, suspecting that the one in
                  the older portion led directly into the kitchen, I rapped lightly at the other. In
                  a moment it opened, and Joe ushered me into the "living room."</p>
               <p>That apartment occupied the whole of the newer front, and had a cheerful, cosy
                  appearance. Its floor was covered with a tidy rag carpet, evidently of home
                  manufacture, and its plastered walls were decorated with tasteful paper, and hung
                  with a variety of neatly framed engravings. Opposite the doorway stood a large
                  mahogany bureau, and over it, suspended from<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000076"/> the ceiling by a leathern cord, was a curiously
                  contrived shelving, containing a score or more of well-worn books. Among them I
                  noticed a small edition of Shakspeare, Milton's "Poems," Goldsmith's "England,"
                  the six volumes of "Comprehensive Commentary," Taylor's "Holy Living and Dying,"
                  the "Pilgrim's Progress," a "United States Gazetteer," and a complete set of the
                  theological writings of Swedenborg. Neat chintz curtains covered the small
                  windows, a number of brightly burnished brass candlesticks ornamented a plain
                  wooden mantle over the broad fireplace, and a yellow-pine table, oiled and
                  varnished, on which the "tea things" were still standing, occupied the centre of
                  the apartment.</p>
               <p>Through an open door, at the right of the bureau, I caught a glimpse of the
                  dormitory of the aged African. As on the exterior of the building Joe had written
                  a brief epitome of his history, so in that room he had traced a portion of his
                  character. Its comfortable and almost elegant furnishings told, plainer than any
                  words, that he was a devoted and affectionate son. With its worn woolen carpet,
                  red window hangings, cosy lounge, neat centre table, and small black-walnut
                  bedstead, it might have been mistaken for the private apartment, of a white lady
                  of some pretensions.</p>
               <p>It was a little after nightfall when I entered the cabin, but a bright fire,
                  blazing on the hearth, gave me a full view of its occupants. Aggy, a tidily clad,
                  middle-aged yellow woman, was clearing away the supper table, and Joe's mother was
                  smoking a pipe in a large armchair, in the chimney corner.</p>
               <p>The old negress wore a black levantine gown, open in front, and gathered about the
                  waist by a silken cord; a red and yellow turban, from underneath which escaped a
                  few frosted locks, and a white cambric neckerchief that fell carelessly over her
                  shoulders, and almost hid her withered, scrawny neck. She was upward of seventy,
                  but so infirm that she appeared nearly a hundred. One of her lean, skinny arms,
                  escaping from the loose sleeve of her dress, rested on her knee; and her bowed,
                  bony frame leaned against the arm of her chair, as if incapable of sitting
                  upright. Her features, with the exception of her nose, which curved slightly
                  upward, were thin and regular; and her eyes were large, deep, and densely black,
                  and seemed turned inward, as if gazing with a half-wondering stare at the strange
                  mechanism which held together her queer framework of bones and gutta percha.</p>
               <p>I recognized her as the old woman who had greeted Preston so affectionately on our
                  arrival.</p>
               <p>Turning to her, as he tendered me a chair, Joe said:</p>
               <p>"Mudder, dis am Mr. Kirke."</p>
               <p>Making a feeble effort to rise, and reaching out her trembling hand, she
                  exclaimed, in a voice just above a whisper:</p>
               <p>"You'm welcome yere, right welcome, sar."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, aunty. Pray keep your seat; don't rise on my account."</p>
               <p>"Tank <emph>you,</emph> massa Kirke, fur comin' yere. It'm bery good ob you. Ole
                  nussy lub you, sar; you'm so good ter massa Robert. He'm my own chile, sar!"</p>
               <p>This was undoubtedly a figure of speech, for the old woman's skin was altogether
                  too black not to have given a trifle of its shading to the complexion of her
                  children. It was not only black, but blue black, and of that peculiar hue which is
                  seen only on the faces of native Africans.</p>
               <p>Seeing that she had relinquished smoking, I said.</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6528-00000077"/>
               <p>"Never mind me, aunty; I smoke, myself, sometimes."</p>
               <p>"Tank you, sar," she replied, resuming her pipe, and relapsing into her previous
                  position; "ole wimmin lub 'backer, sar."</p>
               <p>The low tone in which this was said, made me conclude that further conversation
                  would be exhausting to her; so, turning to Joe and Aggy—the latter had hurried
                  through her domestic employments, and taken a seat near the fire—I entered into a
                  general discussion of the old worthies that occupied Joe's book shelves.</p>
               <p>I found the negro had taxed them for house room. He had levied on their best
                  thoughts, and I soon experienced the uneasy sensation which one feels when he
                  encounters a man who can "talk him dry" on almost any subject. On the single topic
                  of the business to which I was educated, I might have displayed—had it not been
                  Sunday night—a greater amount of information; but in knowledge of every subject
                  that was broached, the black was my superior.</p>
               <p>The conversation had rambled on for a full half hour, the old negress meanwhile
                  puffing steadily away, and giving no heed to it; when suddenly her pipe dropped
                  from her mouth, her eyes closed, her bent figure became erect, and a quick,
                  convulsive shiver passed over her. Thinking she was about to fall in a fit, I
                  exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Joe! See—your mother!"</p>
               <p>"Neber min', sar," he quietly replied; "it'm nuffin'. Only de power am on
                  har."</p>
               <p>A few more convulsive spasms followed, when the old woman's face assumed a settled
                  expression; and, swaying her body back and forth with a slow, steady motion, she
                  commenced menced humming a low chant. Gradually it grew louder, till it broke into
                  a strange, wild song, filling the room, and coming back in short, broken echoes,
                  from the adjoining apartments. Struck with astonishment, I was about to speak,
                  when Joe, laying his hand on my arm, said:</p>
               <p>"Hush, sar! It am de song ob de kidnap slave!"</p>
               <p>It was sung in the African tongue, but I thought I heard, as it rose and fell in a
                  wild, irregular cadence, the thrilling story of the stolen black; his smothered
                  cries and fevered moans in the slaver's hold; the shriek of the wind, and the
                  sullen sound of the surging waves breaking against the accursed ship; and, then—as
                  the old negress rose and poured forth quick, broken volumes of song—the loud mirth
                  of the drunken crew, mingled with what seemed dying groans, and the heavy splash
                  of falling bodies striking the sea.</p>
               <p>As she concluded—with a firm, stately step, showing none of her previous
                  decrepitude—she approached me.</p>
               <p>Seeing that I regarded her with a look of startled interest, Joe said:</p>
               <p>"Leff har do what she likes, sar. She hab suffin' ter say ter you."</p>
               <p>Taking a small bag<ref rend="super" target="#note_003" xml:id="return_003">*</ref>
                   from her bosom, and placing it in the open front of my waistcoat, she
                  reached out her long, skeleton arm, and, placing her hand on the top of my head,
                  chanted a low song. The words were mostly English, but they have passed from my
                  remembrance.</p>
               <note place="foot" xml:id="note_003">

                     "kunger," by the Southern blacks, and is supposed to have the power to charm
                     away evil spirits, and to do all manner of miraculously good things for its
                     wearer. Those that I have seen are harmless little affairs, consisting only
                     of small pieces of rags sewed up in coarse muslin.</p>

               <p>As she finished the invocation, she took my hands in hers, and, leaning forward
                  and muttering a few low words, seemed trying to read the story imprinted on my
                  palms. Her eyes were closed, and, thinking she might be troubled to see without
                  the use of those organs, I looked inquiringly at her son.</p>
               <p>"She doan't need eyes, sar," said Joe, answering my thought; "she'll tell all
                  'bout you widout dem."</p>
               <p>As he said this, she dropped my hands, and, raising her right arm, made several
                  passes over my head; then, resting her hand again upon it, she began chanting
                  another low song.</p>
               <p>"What do you see, mudder?" asked Joe, leaning forward, with a look of intense
                  interest on his face.</p>
               <p>The old woman then went on to detail some occurrences in my past life; and truth
                  obliges me to say that she told them correctly. They were known to her master, and
                  she might have learned them from him; therefore I was not forced to believe her
                  possessed of supernatural power; still, as she stood there in the dim light of the
                  burning logs, which lit up her tall, black form, and cast a red glow over her
                  thin, weird features, a feeling of awe crept over me, and I rose halfway to my
                  feet.</p>
               <p>"Sit still, sar," said Joe, motioning me back into the chair. "You'll break de
                  power."</p>
               <p>"You seem to know the past, old woman," I said. "Tell me the future!"</p>
               <p>"Stop!" she replied, with an imperious gesture. "Dey'm comin'."</p>
               <p>All this while she had stood with her hand on my head, as immovable as a statue.
                  Her voice had a deep, strong tone, and her face wore a look of calm power. Nothing
                  about her reminded me of the weak, decrepit old woman she had seemed but an hour
                  before.</p>
               <p>"Dey'm yere!" she said; and, in another moment, the door opened, and Preston and
                  his wife entered.</p>
               <p>Without rising or speaking, Joe motioned them to two vacant chairs. As they seated
                  themselves, I said:</p>
               <p>"She has told me some curious things."</p>
               <p>"She has strange powers," replied Preston.</p>
               <p>"Hush, Robert Preston. De swanga gemman ax fur de future!"</p>
               <p>Shading, then, her closed eyes with one hand, and leaning forward, as if peering
                  into the far distance, the old negress laid her other hand again on my head, and
                  proceeded to tell me the future. It was portrayed allegorically, and seemed
                  singularly bound up with Preston's. As I look back now, on the twenty years which
                  have passed since then, and think of some of her predictions, and of
                     <emph>some</emph> events which have occurred in my life, I have to admit that
                  the old slave woman had a wonderful talent at guessing. However, who is there that
                  has not been startled by the strange foretellings of some gipsy, black or white?
                  And yet, who believes that any eye but that of the ALL-SEEING can pierce the thick
                  cloud which veils the future?</p>
               <p>The next morning I bade adieu to my kind friends, and started again on my journey.
                  Preston accompanied me as far as Wilmington, where we parted: he going on to
                  Whitesville, in search of the new turpentine location; and I proceeding, by the
                  Charleston boat, southward.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A SCHOOLMISTRESS AND A WIFE.</head>
               <p>RETURNING to my home, a few weeks after the events narrated in the previous
                  chapter, in pursuance of a promise made to Preston, I inserted an advertisement in
                  the papers, which read somewhat as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"WANTED, a suitable person to go South, as governess in a planter's family. She
                     must be thoroughly educated, and competent to instruct a boy of twelve. Such a
                     one may apply, by letter;" &amp; c., &amp; c.</p>
               </q>
               <p>A score of replies flowed in within the few following days, but, being excessively
                  occupied with a mass of personal business, which had accumulated in my absence, I
                  laid them all aside, till more than a week had passed. Then, one evening, I took
                  them home, and Kate and I opened the batch. As each one was read by my wife or
                  myself, we commented on the character of the writers, as indicated by the
                  handwriting and general style of the epistles. Rejecting about two thirds as
                  altogether unworthy of attention, we reserved the remaining half dozen for a
                  second inspection. Among these, the one with the cramped, precise chirography was
                  thought to come from an old maid. Another, where five lines of rail fence covered
                  a sheet nearly as large as a ten-acre lot, was the production of a strong-minded
                  woman. A third, on tinted paper, and dotted with blots and erasures, was from a
                  fat lady, who wore her shoes down at the heel, and got up too late for breakfast.
                  "But here, Kate," I exclaimed, as I opened the fourth missive, "this one, in this
                  firm yet ladylike hand—this one will do. Hear what it says:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"'SIR: I think I can answer your requirements. A line addressed to Catharine
                     Walley, B——, N. H., with full particulars, will receive immediate
                     attention.'</p>
               </q>
               <p>"That's the woman, Kate—a business man in petticoats! <emph>She</emph> can manage
                  a boy of twelve!"</p>
               <p>"Or a man of twice that age," said Kate, quietly reading the letter. "I wouldn't
                  have that woman in <emph>my</emph> house."</p>
               <p>"Why not? She has character, take my word for it. Her letter is as short and sweet
                  as a 'promise to pay.'"</p>
               <p>"She has too much character, and not of the right sort. There is no womanliness
                  about her."</p>
               <p>"You women are always hard on your own sex. She'll have to manage Joe, and she'll
                  need to be half man to do that. I think I had better write her to come here. I can
                  tell what she is when I see her. I can read a woman like a book."</p>
               <p>There was a slight twinkle in my wife's eyes when I said this, and she made some
                  further objections; but I overruled them, and, on the following morning,
                  despatched a letter, inviting Miss Walley to the city.</p>
               <p>Returning to my office from "'Change," one afternoon, a<pb n="158-159"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000080"/> few days afterward, I found a lady awaiting me. She
                  rose, as I entered, and gave her name as Miss Walley. She was prepossessing and
                  ladylike in appearance, and there was a certain ease and self-possession in her
                  manner, which I was surprised to see in one directly from a remote country town.
                  She wore a plain gray dress, with a cape of the same material; a straw hat, neatly
                  trimmed with brown ribbon, and, on the inside, a bunch of deep pink flowers, which
                  gave a slight coloring to her otherwise pale and sallow, but intellectual face.
                  Her whole dress indicated refinement and taste. She was tall and slight, with an
                  almost imperceptible stoop in the shoulders, the result of a studious habit; but
                  you forgot this seeming defect in her easy and graceful movements. Her brown hair
                  was combed plainly over a rather low and narrow forehead; her face was long and
                  thin, and her small, clear gray eyes were shaded by brown eyebrows meeting
                  together, and, when she was talking earnestly, or listening attentively, slightly
                  contracting, and deepening her keen and thoughtful expression. Her nose was long,
                  and rather prominent; and her mouth and chin were large, showing character and
                  will; but their masculine expression was relieved by a short upper lip, which
                  displayed to full advantage the finest set of teeth I ever saw.</p>
               <p>Referring at once to the object of her visit, she handed me a number of
                  credentials, highly commendatory of her character and ability as a teacher. I
                  glanced over them, and remarked that they were satisfactory. She then questioned
                  me as to the compensation she would receive, and the position of the family
                  needing her services. Answering these inquiries, I added that I was prepared to
                  engage her on the terms I had named.</p>
               <p>"I have been in receipt of the same salary as assistant in a school in my native
                  village," she replied; "but what you say of the family of Mr. Preston, and a
                  desire to visit the South, will induce me to accept the situation."</p>
               <p>"When will you be ready to go, madam?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"At once. To-day, if necessary."</p>
               <p>Surprised, and yet pleased with her promptness, I said:</p>
               <p>"And are you entirely ready to go so far on so short notice?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. The cars leave in the morning, I am told. I will start then."</p>
               <p>"And alone?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. We Yankee girls are accustomed to takeing care of ourselves."</p>
               <p>"I admire your independence. But you pass the night in town; you will, I trust,
                  spend it at my house?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you."</p>
               <p>Ordering a carriage, and stopping on the way at a hotel to get the single trunk
                  which contained her wardrobe, I conveyed her to my residence.</p>
               <p>After supper, we all gathered in the parlor, and I set about entertaining our
                  guest. I had to make little effort to do that, for her conversation soon displayed
                  a knowledge of books and people, and a wit and keenness of intellect, that
                  decidedly entertained me. She was not only agreeable, but brilliant, and, in the
                  course of the evening, made some pleasant overtures to the children. Frank, with a
                  book in his hand, had drawn his chair off to another part of the room, and showed,
                  at first, uncommon reserve for a lad of his warm and genial nature; but gradually,
                  as if in spite of himself, he edged nearer to her. Our little "four-year-old,"
                  however, resisting the offered temptation<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6528-00000081"
                  /> tation of watch and chain, and even sugar-plums, repelled her advances, and hid
                  his curly head only the more closely in the folds of his mother's dress. Kate
                  listened and laughed; but I caught occasionally, as her eyes studied the visitor
                  attentively, a troubled expression, which I well understood. After a while the
                  lady expressed a wish to retire, that she might obtain the rest needed for an
                  early start by the morning train, and Kate conducted her to her apartment.</p>
               <p>I felt highly delighted with the idea of being able to send Mrs. Preston so
                  agreeable a companion, and not a little vexed with my wife for not sharing my
                  enthusiasm. When she returned to the parlor, I said:</p>
               <p>"Kate, why do you not like her?"</p>
               <p>"I can hardly tell <emph>why,</emph>" she replied, "but my first impression is
                  confirmed. I would not trust her. Why does she go South for the same salary she
                  has had in New Hampshire?"</p>
               <p>"Because she wants to see the world; she's a stirring Yankee woman."</p>
               <p>"No; because you told her of Mr. Preston's position in society; and because she
                  hopes to win a plantation and a rich planter."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense," I replied. "You misjudge her."</p>
               <p>"I tell you, Edmund, she is a cold, selfish, sordid woman; all intellect, and no
                  heart. If I had never seen her face, I should have known that by her voice, and
                  the shake of her hand."</p>
               <p>But it was too late—I had engaged her; and at seven o'clock on the following
                  morning she was on her way to the South.</p>
               <p>I soon received information of her safe arrival at the plantation tation, and the
                  warm thanks of Preston for having sent him so agreeable a person, and one so well
                  fitted to instruct his children.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The turpentine location was soon secured, and, early in the following spring, Joe,
                  with about a hundred "prime hands," commenced operations in the new field.
                  Constantly increasing shipments soon gave evidence of the energy with which the
                  negro entered upon his work; and, by the end of the year, Preston had not only
                  paid the advances we made on receiving the deed of the land, but also the note I
                  had given for the purchase of Phyllis. For the first time in five years he was
                  entirely out of our debt.</p>
               <p>The next season he hired a force of nearly two hundred negroes, and generously
                  gave Joe a small interest in the new business, with a view to the black's
                  ultimately buying his freedom. His transactions soon became large and profitable
                  both to him and to us. Shortly afterward he paid off the last of his floating
                  debt, and his balances in our hands grew from nothing till they reached five and
                  seven, and often ten thousand dollars.</p>
               <p>But heavy affliction overtook him in the midst of his prosperity. His wife and two
                  eldest daughters were stricken down by a prevailing epidemic, and died within a
                  fortnight of each other. A letter which I received from him, at this time, will
                  best relate these events. It was as follows:</p>

                              this threefold affliction, I have not been able to write you before.
                              Even now I can hardly hold a pen. I am perfectly paralyzed; I can
                              neither act nor think—I can only <emph>feel.</emph>

                              family; but none can know what she has been to me—companion, friend,
                              guide! My stay and support through long years of trial, she is taken
                              from me just as prosperity is dawning on me, and I was hoping to
                              repay, by a life of devotion, some part of what she had borne and
                              suffered on my account. Another angel has been welcomed in heaven, but
                              I am left here—alone—alone, with my grief and my remorse!</p>
                           <p>"My son is inconsolable, and even little Selly seems to realize the

                              moment. She is now the only comfort I have. Miss Walley has been
                              unremitting in her kindness and attention, taking the burden of
                              everything upon herself. Indeed, I do not know what I should have done
                              without her.</p>

               <p>Nothing worthy of special mention occurred to the persons whose history I am
                  relating, till about a year after the death of Mrs. Preston. Then, one day late in
                  the autumn, I received information of her husband's approaching marriage with the
                  governess. In the letter which invited me to be present at the ceremony, Preston
                  said: "No one can ever fill the place in my heart that is occupied, and will ever
                  be occupied, by the memory of my sainted wife; but Miss Walley has rendered
                  herself indispensable to me and my family. My studious habits and ignorance of
                  business made me, as you know, even in my full health and strength, a poor
                  manager; and, during the past year, grief has so impaired my spirits, that I have
                  been utterly unfitted for attending to the commonest affairs. But for Miss Walley,
                  everything would have gone to waste and ruin. With the efficiency of a business
                  man, she has attended to my household, overseen my negroes, and managed my entire
                  plantation. In the first months of my bereavement, when grief so entirely
                  overwhelmed me that I saw no one, I did not know to what censorious remark her
                  disinterested devotion to my interests was subjecting her; but recently I have
                  realized the impropriety of a young, unmarried woman occupying the position she
                  holds in my household. Miss Walley, also, has felt this, and some time since
                  notified me, though with evident reluctance, that she felt it imperatively
                  necessary to leave my service. What, then, could I do? My people needed a
                  mistress, my children a mother. She was both. Only one course seemed open; and,
                  after mature deliberation, I offered her my hand, frankly stating that my heart is
                  with the angel who, lost to me here, will be mine hereafter. Satisfied with my
                  friendship and esteem, she has accepted me, and we are to be married on the 26th
                  inst.; when I sincerely trust that you, my dear friend, and your estimable lady,
                  will be present."</p>
               <p>That night I took the letter home to my wife. She read it, and, laying it down
                  sadly, said:</p>
               <p>"Oh, Edmund! I fear.—I greatly fear for his future!"</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Two years went by, and I did not meet Preston, but our business relations kept us
                  in frequent correspondence, and his letters occasionally alluded to his domestic
                  affairs.</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6528-00000083"/>
               <p>Very soon after his marriage with the governess, his son went to live with his
                  uncle, Mr. James Preston, of Mobile, a wealthy bachelor, who long before had
                  expressed the intention of having the boy succeed to his business and estate.
                  "Boss Joe" continued in charge of the turpentine plantation, and had built him a
                  house, and removed his wife and aged mother to his new home. On one of my visits
                  to the South, I stopped overnight with him, and was delighted with his model
                  establishment. Two hundred as cheerful-looking darkies as ever swung a turpentine
                  axe, were gathered in tents and small shanties around his neat log cabin, and Joe
                  seemed as happy as if he were governor of a province.</p>
               <p>His operations had grown to such magnitude, that Preston then ranked among the
                  largest producers of the North Carolina staple, and his "account" had become one
                  of the most valuable on our books. Though we sent "accounts current" and
                  duplicates of each "account sales" to his master, our regular "returns" were made
                  to Joe; and no one of our correspondents held us to so strict accountability, or
                  so often expressed dissatisfaction with the result of his shipments, as he.</p>
               <p>"I thinks a heap of you, Mr. Kirke," he said, at the close of one of his letters
                  about this time; "but the fact am, thar's no friendship in trade, and you
                     <emph>did</emph> sell that lass pile of truck jess one day too sudden."</p>

               <head type="sub">FRANK.</head>
               <p>TWO more years rolled away. Frank was nearly sixteen. He had grown up a fine,
                  manly lad, and never for, one moment had Kate or I regretted the care we had
                  bestowed on his education and training. He was all we could have wished for in our
                  own son, and in his warm love and cheerful obedience we both found the blessing
                  invoked on us by his dying mother.</p>
               <p>His affection for Kate was something more than the common feeling of a child for a
                  parent. With that was blended a sort of half worship, which made him listen to her
                  every word, and hang on her every look, as if she were a being of some higher
                  order than he. They were inseparable. He preferred her society to that of his
                  young companions; and often, when he was a child, seated by her knee, and
                  listening, when she told of his "other mother" in the "beautiful heaven," have I
                  seen his eye wander to her face, with an expression which plainly said: "My heart
                  knows no 'other mother' than you." Kate was proud of him; and well she might be,
                  for he was a comely youth; and his straight, closely knit, sinewy frame, dark,
                  deepset eyes, and broad, open forehead, overhung with thick, brown hair, only
                  outshadowed a beautiful mind, an open,<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6528-00000084"/>
                  upright, manly nature, whose firm and steady integrity nothing could shake.</p>
               <p>About this time I received a letter from his father, which, as it had an important
                  bearing on the lad's future career, I give to the reader:</p>

                              son. May I not ask you to bring him to me at once? Then I will arrange

               <head type="sub">RUSSELL, ROLLINS &amp; CO.</head>
               <p>IT was a dingy old sign. It had hung there, in sun and rain, till its letters were
                  faint and its face was furrowed. It had looked down on a generation that had
                  passed away, and seen those who placed it there go out of that doorway, never to
                  return; still it clung to that dingy old warehouse, and still Russell, Rollins
                  &amp; Co. was signed in the dingy old counting room at the head of the stairway.
                  It was known the world over. It was heard of on the cotton fields of Texas, in the
                  canebrakes of Cuba, and amid the rice swamps of Carolina. The Chinaman spoke of it
                  as he sipped his tea and plied his chopsticks in the streets of Canton; and the
                  half-naked negro rattled its gold as he gathered palm oil and the copal gum on the
                  western coast of Africa. Its plain initials, painted in black on a white ground,
                  waved from tall masts over many seas, and its simple "promise to pay," scrawled in
                  a bad hand on a narrow strip of paper, unlocked the vaults of the best bankers in
                  Europe. And yet it was a dingy old sign! Men looked up to it as they passed by,
                  and wondered that a cracked, weather-beaten board, that would not sell for a
                  dollar, should be counted "good for a million."</p>
               <p>It was a dingy old warehouse, with narrow, dark, cob-webbed webbed windows, and
                  wide, rusty-iron shutters, which, as the bleak October wind swept up old Long
                  Wharf, swung slowly on their hinges with a sharp, grating creak. I heard them in
                  my boyhood. Perched on a tall stool at that old desk, I used to listen, in the
                  long winter nights, to those strange, wild cries, till I fancied they were voices
                  of the uneasy dead, come back to take the vacant seats beside me, and to pace
                  again, with ghostly tread, the floor of that dark old counting room. They were a
                  mystery and a terror to me; but they never creaked so harshly, or cried so wildly,
                  as on that October night, when, for the first time in nine years, I turned my
                  steps up the trembling old stairway.</p>
               <p>It was just after nightfall. A single gas burner threw a dim, uncertain light over
                  the old desk, and lit up the figure of a tall, gray-haired man, who was bending
                  over it. He had round, stooping shoulders, and long, spindling limbs. One of his
                  large feet, encased in a thick, square-toed shoe, rested on the round of the desk;
                  the other, planted squarely on the floor, upheld his spare, gaunt frame. His face
                  was thin and long, and two deep, black lines under his eyes contrasted strangely
                  with the pallid whiteness of his features. His clothes were of the fashion of
                  those good people called "Friends," and had served long as his "Sunday best,"
                  before being degraded to daily duty. They were of plain brown, and, though not
                  shabby, were worn and threadbare, and of decidedly economical appearance.
                  Everything about him, indeed, wore an economical look. His scant coat tails,
                  narrow pants, and short waist-coat, showed that the cost of each inch of material
                  had been counted; while his thin hair, brushed carefully over his bald head, had
                  not a lock to spare; and even his large, sharp bones<pb n="170-171"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000086"/> were covered with only just enough flesh to hold
                  them comfortably together. He had stood there till his eye was dim and his step
                  feeble; and though he had, for twenty years—when handing in each semiannual trial
                  balance to the head of the house—declared that was his last, everybody said he
                  would continue to stand there till his own trial balance was struck, and his
                  earthly accounts were closed forever.</p>
               <p>As I entered, he turned his mild blue eye upon me, and, taking my hand warmly in
                  his, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"My dear boy, I am glad to see thee!"</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see <emph>you,</emph> David. Is Alice well?"</p>
               <p>"Very well. And Kate, and thy babies?"</p>
               <p>"All well," I replied.</p>
               <p>"Thee has come to see John?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. How is he?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! better; he got out several days ago. He's inside now;" and, opening the door
                  of an inner office, separated from the outer one by a glass partition, he said:
                  "John, Edmund is here."</p>
               <p>A tall, dark man came to the door, and, with a slightly flurried and embarrassed
                  manner, said:</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mr. Kirke! I'm glad to see you. Please step in."</p>
               <p>As he tendered me a chair, a shorter and younger gentleman, who was writing at
                  another desk, sprang from his seat and, slapping me familiarly on the back,
                  exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow, how are you?"</p>
               <p>"Very well, Cragin; how are <emph>you?</emph>" I replied, returning his cordial
                  greeting.</p>
               <p>"Good as new—never better in my life. It's good for one's health to see you
                     <emph>here.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I have come at Mr. Hallet's invitation."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know. Hallet has told me you've a smart boy you want us to take. Send him
                  along. Boston's the place to train a youngster to business."</p>
               <p>The last speaker was not more than thirty, but a bald spot on the top of his head,
                  and a slight falling in of his mouth, caused by premature decay of the front
                  teeth, made him seem several years older. He had marked but not regular features,
                  and a restless, dark eye, that opened and shut with a peculiar wink, which kept
                  time with the motion of his lips in speaking. His clothes were cut in a loose,
                  jaunty style, and his manner, though brusque and abrupt, betokened, like his face,
                  a free, frank, whole-souled character. He was several years the junior of the
                  other, and as unlike him as one man can be unlike another.</p>
               <p>The older gentleman, as I have said, was tall and dark. He had a high, bold
                  forehead, a pale, sallow complexion, and wore heavy, gray whiskers, trimmed with
                  the utmost nicety, and meeting under a sharp, narrow chin. His face was large, his
                  jaws wide, and his nose pointed and prominent; but his mouth was small, and
                  gathered in at the corners like a rat's; and, as if to add to the rat resemblance,
                  its puny, white teeth seemed borrowed from that animal. There was a stately
                  precision in his manner, and a stealthy softness in his tread, not often seen in
                  combination, which might have impressed a close observer as indicative of a bold,
                  pompous, and yet cunning character.</p>
               <p>These two gentlemen—Mr. Hallet and Mr. Cragin—were the only surviving partners of
                  the great house of Russell, Rollins &amp; Co.</p>
               <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6528-00000087"/>
               <p>"Have you brought him with you?" asked Hallet, his voice trembling a little, and
                  his pale face flushing slightly as he spoke.</p>
               <p>"No, sir," I replied; "I thought I would confer with you first. I have not yet
                  broached the subject to the lad."</p>
               <p>Some unimportant conversation followed, when Hallet, turning to Cragin, asked:</p>
               <p>"Are all the letters written for to-morrow's steamer?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Cragin, rising; "and I believe I'll leave you two together. As you've
                  not spoken for ten years, you must have a good deal to say. Come, David," he
                  called out, as he drew on his outside coat, "let's go."</p>
               <p>"No; don't take David," I exclaimed; "I want to talk with the old gentleman."</p>
               <p>"But you can see him to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"No; I return in the morning."</p>
               <p>"Well, David, I'll tell Alice you'll be home by nine."</p>
               <p>"Oh! that's it," I said, laughing. "It's Alice who makes you leave so early on
                  steamer night."</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>sir;</emph> Alice that <emph>is,</emph> and Mrs. Augustus Cragin that
                  is <emph>to be</emph>—when I get a new set of teeth. Good night;" and, saying
                  this, he took up his cane, and left the office.</p>
               <p>When he was gone, Hallet said to me:</p>
               <p>"Do you desire that David should be a witness to our interview?"</p>
               <p>"I want him to be a <emph>party</emph> to it. We can come to no arrangement
                  without his coöperation."</p>
               <p>Hallet asked the bookkeeper in. When he was seated, I said:</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Hallet, what do you propose to do for your son?"</p>
               <p>"To treat him as I do my other children. Do all but acknowledge him. That would
                  injure him."</p>
               <p>"That is not important. But please be explicit as to what you will do."</p>
               <p>"David tells me that the lad's inclinations tend to business, and that you have
                  meant to take him into your office. I will take him into <emph>mine,</emph> and,
                  when he is twenty-one—if he has conducted himself properly, give him an
                  interest."</p>
               <p>"I shall be satisfied with no <emph>contingent</emph> arrangement, sir. I know
                  Frank will prove worthy of the position."</p>
               <p>"Very well; then I will agree definitely to make him a partner when he is of
                  age."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Hallet, if Frank will consent to come, I will agree to this, with
                  certain conditions. I told his mother, when she was dying, that I would consider
                  him my own child; therefore I cannot give up the control of him. He must regard me
                  and depend on me as he does now. Besides, I cannot let him come here, and have no
                  home whose influence shall protect him from the temptations which beset young men
                  in large cities. David must take him into his family, and treat him as he treated
                  me when I was a boy; and—this must be reduced to writing."</p>
               <p>Hallet showed some emotion when I spoke of Frank's mother, but his face soon
                  resumed its usual expression, and he promptly replied:</p>
               <p>"I will agree to all that; but I would suggest that the fact of his being my son
                  should not be communicated to him; that<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC6528-00000088"/>
                  it should be confined to us three. I ask this, believe me, only for the sake of my
                  family."</p>
               <p>"I see no objection to that, sir; and I think Frank, for his own sake, should not
                  know what his prospects are."</p>
               <p>Hallet signified assent, and, turning to David, I asked:</p>
               <p>"David, what do <emph>you</emph> say? Will you take him?"</p>
               <p>"I will," said the old bookkeeper, showing, in his expenditure of breath, the
                  close economy which was the rule of his life.</p>
               <p>"Nothing remains but to arrange his salary, and the share he shall have when he
                  becomes a partner," I remarked to Hallet.</p>
               <p>"Will an average of seven hundred a year, and an eighth interest when he's
                  twenty-one, be satisfactory?"</p>
               <p>"Entirely so. An eighth in your house will be better than a quarter in ours. As it
                  is now all understood, let David draw up the papers. We will sign them, and leave
                  them with him till I see Frank."</p>
               <p>"Very well. David; please to draw them up," said Hallet; and then, his voice again
                  trembling a little, he added: "All is understood, Mr. Kirke, but the compensation
                  I shall make you for your fatherly care of my much-neglected son. Money cannot pay
                  for such service, but it will relieve me to reimburse you for your
                  expenditures."</p>
               <p>"I have had my pay, sir, in the love of the boy. I ask no more."</p>
               <p>Hallet was sensibly affected, but, without speaking, he turned to the desk, and
                  took down his bankbook. In a few moments he handed me a check. It was for five
                  thousand dollars. I took it, and, hesitating an instant, said:</p>
               <p>"I will keep this, sir, not for myself, but for Frank. It may be of service to him
                  at some future time."</p>
               <p>"Keep it for yourself, sir, not for him. He will not need it. He shall share
                  equally with my other children."</p>
               <p>"I am glad to see this spirit in you. Frank will be worthy of all you do for
                  him."</p>
               <p>"It is not for <emph>his</emph> sake that I will do it," replied Hallet, his voice
                  tremulous with emotion; "it is that I may have the forgiveness of the one I—I—" He
                  said no more, but, leaning his head on his hand, he wept!</p>
               <p>No one spoke for some minutes; at last David rose, and, handing me one of the
                  papers, laid the other before Hallet.</p>
               <p>"This appears right," I said, after reading it over carefully.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Hallet, taking up a pen and signing the other. Passing it to me, he
                  added: "Keep them both—take them now."</p>
               <p>"But Frank may not wish to come."</p>
               <p>"Then I will find some other way of helping him. He is my son! Take the
                  papers."</p>
               <p>"Well, as you say," I replied. "David, please to witness this."</p>
               <p>Hallet pressed me to pass the night at his house, but I declined, and rode out to
                  Cambridge with the old bookkeeper. With many injunctions to watch carefully over
                  Frank, I left him about twelve o'clock, rode into town with Cragin, and the next
                  morning started for New York.</p>
               <p>That night, as I recounted the interview to Kate, I said:</p>
               <pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6528-00000089"/>
               <p>"I never did believe in these double-quick conversions; but Hallet <emph>is</emph>
                  an altered man."</p>
               <p>"Then, indeed, can the leopard change his spots."</p>
               <p>As usual, her womanly intuitions were right; my worldly wisdom was wrong!</p>

               <p>NOT long after the events I have just related, the mail brought me the following
                  letter from Preston:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"MY VERY DEAR FRIEND: Circumstances, which I cannot explain by letter, render
                     it <emph>imperatively</emph> necessary that I should provide another home for
                     my daughter. Her education has been sadly neglected, and she should be where
                     she can have experienced tutors, and good social surroundings. With her
                     delicate organization, and sensitive and susceptible nature, she needs
                        <emph>motherly</emph> care and affection, and I shrink from committing her
                     to the hands of strangers. I should feel at rest about her only with
                        <emph>you.</emph> You have been my steadfast friend through many years; you
                     have stood by me in sore trials; may I not, then, ask you to do me now a
                     greater service than you have ever done, by receiving my little daughter into
                     your family? I know this is an unusual, almost presumptuous request; but if you
                     knew her as she is—gentle, loving, obedient—the light and joy of all about her,
                     I am sure you, and your excellent lady, would love her, and be willing to make
                     her the companion of your children. She is my only earthly comfort, and it will
                     rend my heart to part with her, but—I <emph>must.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6528-00000090"/>
                  <p>"Write me at once. You are yourself a father—<emph>do not refuse
                     me.</emph>"</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this, on the next day, I sent the following reply:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"MY DEAR FRIEND: I would most cheerfully take your daughter into my family, did
                     my wife's health, which has been failing all the summer, admit of her assuming
                     any additional care.</p>
                  <p>"I think, however, I can provide Selma with a home equally as good as my own;
                     one where good influences will be about her, and she will have the best
                     educational advantages. I refer to the family of Mr. David Gray, of Cambridge,
                     Massachusetts. He was my father's friend. The years I was a boy with Russell,
                     Rollins &amp; Co., I was an inmate of his house; and my adopted son, Frank, is
                     now in his care. His daughter Alice is a most suitable person to have charge of
                     a young girl. She is like a sister to me, and, to oblige me, would no doubt
                     take Selma.</p>
                  <p>"Please advise me of your wishes; and believe, my dear friend, I will do all in
                     my power to serve you."</p>
               </q>
               <p>I was sitting down at supper, one evening, about a fortnight after sending this
                  letter, when a gentleman was announced as wishing to see me. I rose, and went into
                  the parlor. It was Preston, and with him was Selma, then a beautiful little girl
                  of about eleven years.</p>
               <p>Asking Preston to lay aside his outside coat, I was struck by his altered
                  appearance. It was four years since we had met, but, looking at him, I imagined it
                  might be ten. His eyes were sunken, deep furrows were about his mouth, and his
                  brown hair was thickly streaked with gray.</p>
               <p>"My dear friend," I exclaimed, as I grasped his hand a second time, "you are not
                  well!"</p>
               <p>"I am as well as usual, Kirke. Time has not done this!"</p>
               <p>Fatigued with the long journey, Selma had retired, and our own little ones were in
                  bed, when Kate joined us in the parlor.</p>
               <p>"You <emph>do</emph> look ill, Mr. Preston," she said, seating herself beside him.
                  "You must stay a while with us, and rest."</p>
               <p>"I would be glad to stay here, madam—anywhere away from home."</p>
               <p>"The care of two plantations, such as yours, must be a burden."</p>
               <p>"It is not that, madam; Joe relieves me entirely from oversight of one of them. My
                  difficulty is at home—it is not what yours is."</p>
               <p>Kate's sympathizing words soon drew him out (she has a way of winning the
                  confidence of people, and is the depositary of more family secrets than any other
                  woman in the State); and he told us what his home had become since his union with
                  the governess.</p>
               <p>Within two months after the marriage her real character began to display itself,
                  and she soon developed into a genuine Xantippe. Getting control of Mulock, who had
                  been made overseer, she had the negroes dreadfully whipped and over-worked; she
                  treated young master Joe so badly that the lad rebelled, and, in his father's
                  absence, ran away to his uncle at Mobile; and locking Selma up in a dark room,
                  without food, or beating her till her back was actually discolored, she made the
                  child's home intolerable to her.</p>
               <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6528-00000091"/>
               <p>After master Joe went away, no one dared complain; and shut up in his library,
                  brooding over his still fresh grief for the death of his wife, Preston knew
                  nothing of the real state of affairs till more than a year had elapsed. Then, one
                  day, he found Selma in tears. He questioned her, and learned the whole. A scene
                  followed, in which Mrs. Preston asserted her rights as mistress of the plantation,
                  and defied him. She had run into all sorts of extravagance; the yearly bills,
                  which had come in a short time previous, were appallingly large, but, to secure
                  peace, Preston consented to buy and furnish a winter residence at Newbern. To that
                  she had removed; but, with the coming spring, she would return to the plantation,
                  and in the mean time Selma must be provided with another home.</p>
               <p>"Feel no anxiety about her, sir," said Kate, as he concluded; "if Alice Gray will
                  not take her, we will."</p>
               <p>"I thank you, madam; I cannot thank you enough for saying that," replied Preston,
                  his eyes filling with tears.</p>
               <p>I wrote at once to David, and soon received a letter from Alice consenting to take
                  charge of the little girl. Thanksgiving, at which time Kate made annual visits to
                  her early home, was approaching, and it was decided that Selma should accompany
                  her to Boston.</p>
               <p>This being arranged, Preston, at the end of a fortnight, took leave of us, and
                  returned to the South. The parting between the father and the child gave evidence
                  of what they were to each other. Preston wept like a woman; but as Kate brushed
                  back the brown curls from the broad forehead of little Selly, she raised her eyes
                  to my wife's face, and, while her thin nostrils dilated, and her sensitive chin
                  slightly quivered, said:</p>
               <p>"I must not cry, for poor papa's sake—it is so <emph>very</emph> hard for him to
                  go home alone; and he will miss his little girl <emph>so</emph> much."</p>
               <p>"You are right, dear child," said Kate; and, as if looking into the far future of
                  the woman, and feeling that such a nature must suffer as well as enjoy keenly, she
                  inwardly thanked God that, with her delicate organization, He had given her the
                  unselfish and brave heart which those words expressed.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Four years had wrought great changes in David's quiet home. Alice had become Mrs.
                  Augustus Cragin, and a little Alice tottled about the floor; but after supper,
                  David still found his evening cigar on the oak stand, his, needlework
                  slippers—wrought by Alice's own hand—in their place before the fender, and his
                  large armchair rolled up close to the gas burner in the little back parlor at
                  Cambridge.</p>
               <p>Frank was twenty, and had fulfilled the promise of his boyhood. His father, after
                  the honeymoon of his repentance was over, showed no great interest in him; but
                  Cragin, who knew nothing of my arrangement with Hallet, had given him all the
                  advantages in his power.</p>
               <p>Selma was only fifteen, but, like the flowers of her own South, she had blossomed
                  early, and was already a woman. Preston had visited her every summer, but she
                  never returned with him, having preferred passing her vacations at my house.</p>
               <p>In David's loving household nothing had occurred to disturb her peaceful life.
                  Beloved by her teachers and schoolmates, she everywhere received the homage due to
                  her beauty and her goodness; and in the gay world into which her joyous nature
                  often led her, she was the acknowledged and <emph>unenvied</emph> queen! Her
                  father had spared no pains in her education; the<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000092"/> best tutors had trained her fine ear and sweet
                  voice, and taught her to give form and coloring to the pictures her glowing
                  imagination created; and, whether her fingers ran over the keys of a musical
                  instrument, or wielded the brush, there was a delicacy and yet <emph>spirit</emph>
                  in her touch, which were the wonder and admiration of all.</p>
               <p>I was not surprised, when visiting Boston about this time, to have Frank tell me
                  that he loved her, and ask my consent to his regarding her as his future wife.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Kate and I were to leave for home on the following day, and, calling at the office
                  in the afternoon, I said to Frank:</p>
               <p>"I have tickets for the opera, including Selma; of course you'd like to have her
                  go."</p>
               <p>"Yes, father; she has never been, and I have promised to take her this winter.
                  She'll be able, now, to appreciate it."</p>
               <p>The box I had selected was at a happy distance from the stage, and we gave Selma a
                  front seat, that she might see to the best advantage. She was in high spirits;
                  indeed, she was radiant in her beauty. She wore a dark blue dress of silk, fitting
                  closely to her neck, and its short sleeves allowed the plump, fair arms to half
                  disclose themselves from beneath the scarlet mantle which fell around her
                  shoulders. Her hair fell over her neck in the same simple fashion as in her
                  childhood, except that the thick curls, which had lost their golden tint, and were
                  darker and longer, were looped back from her broad forehead, with a few simple
                  flowers. There was the same contour of face and feature, but ennobled by thought
                  and culture; the same sensitive mouth, only that the lips were fuller, and of a
                  deeper color; and, as she talked or listened, the same rose tint deepened and
                  faded beneath her rich, soft, dark skin, as sunlight shifts and fades across the
                  evening sky. Her eyes, in whose dark depths the soul was reflected, met a
                  stranger's calmly, but took a soft look of loving trust when meeting Frank's. They
                  were shaded by long lashes, as black as the night; and when the lids fell
                  suddenly, as they often did, and her face became quiet, and almost sad, you felt
                  that she was communing with the angels.</p>
               <p>The overture burst forth, and, with glowing face, and eyes fixed upon the stage,
                  Selma seemed lost to all but the enrapturing sounds; even Frank's whispered words
                  were unheeded. As the opera—"Lucia di Lammermoor"—proceeded, I saw that every eye
                  was attracted to our box, and, bending forward to catch Selma's expression, I
                  called Kate's attention to her. With her head thrown slightly back, a bright spot
                  burning on either cheek, her breath suspended, the large tears coursing from her
                  eyes, and motionless as a statue, she sat with her small hands clasped on the
                  front of the box, as if entranced, and all unconscious of the hundred eyes that
                  were fixed upon her. I thought of the pictures I had seen in the old galleries of
                  Europe, but I said, "Surely, art cannot equal nature!"</p>
               <p>When it was over, she took Frank's arm. I turned to question her, but Kate
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Let her alone; she cannot talk now."</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The transactions of Russell, Rollins &amp; Co. extended the world over; but, since
                  the death of Mr. Rollins, which occurred prior to Frank's going with them, they
                  had cultivated particularly the Southern trade, and their operations in cotton had
                  grown to be enormous. They bought largely of that<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000093"/> staple on their own account, and for some extensive
                  manufacturing establishments in England. Their purchases were chiefly made in New
                  Orleans, and, to attend to this business, Hallet had passed the winters in that
                  city for several years.</p>
               <p>His wealth had grown rapidly, and, at the date of which I am writing, he ranked
                  among the "solid men" of Boston Cragin was not nearly so wealthy. Being on
                  intimate terms with the latter, I remarked, as we were enjoying a cigar together
                  one evening at David's, on the occasion of the visit to which I have referred in
                  the this chapter:</p>
               <p>"How is it, Cragin, that you pass for only a hundred thousand, when Hallet is
                  rated nearly a million?"</p>
               <p>"Because, Ned, I'm not worth more."</p>
               <p>"But how is that, when you have two fifths of the concern?"</p>
               <p>"Well, Hallet went into cotton like the devil some ten years ago; and I told him I
                  wouldn't stand it. I like to feel the ground under me. Since then he has
                  speculated on his own account; he and old Roye go it strong, and I guess they've
                  made some pretty heavy lifts."</p>
               <p>"That's uncertain business."</p>
               <p>"Yes, devilish uncertain; but, somehow, they manage always to hold winning cards.
                  Hallet has told me his New Orleans operations have netted him four hundred
                  thousand."</p>
               <p>"And that, with what he got by his wife, has rolled him into a millionaire before
                  he's forty-five! He's a lucky fellow."</p>
               <p>"Lucky! I wouldn't stand in his boots. What goes up, <emph>may</emph> come down.
                  He has no peace. His wife's a hyena. She makes home too hot for him; and, somehow,
                  he's never easy. He walks about as if treading on torpedoes."</p>
               <p>"If you dislike speculation, why not increase your legitimate business?"</p>
               <p>"Hallet's away so much, I can't. I'm glued to the old office. I ought to have been
                  in Europe half of the time the last three years, but I haven't been able to get
                  away."</p>
               <p>"Why not send Frank? He's old enough now."</p>
               <p>"I mean to, in the spring; and I'm d—d if he sha'n't be a partner soon, and take
                  some of this load off my shoulders. But do you know that Hallet has a decided
                  dislike to him?"</p>
               <p>"No! On what account?" I exclaimed. I had met Hallet only twice during four years,
                  but on both occasions he had spoken favorably of his son. Frank himself had never
                  alluded in other than respectful terms to his father.</p>
               <p>"Well, I don't know, and it makes no difference. I'm captain at this end of the
                  towline, and I swear he shall go in."</p>
               <p>"As you feel so kindly toward Frank, I'll give him a chance to conciliate Hallet.
                  I'll take him South, this winter, and introduce him to our correspondents. With
                  his address he ought to do something with them. Will you let him go?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and be right down glad to have him. When do you start?"</p>
               <p>"About the middle of December."</p>
               <p>A fortnight afterward, with Selma and Frank, I again visited Preston's
                  plantation.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">A PLANTATION CHRISTMAS.</head>
               <p>IT was Christmas morning when we rode up the long, winding avenue, and halted
                  before the doorway of "Forest Lake"—the new name which the Yankee schoolmistress,
                  aping the custom of her Yankee cousins, had bestowed on Preston's plantation. The
                  day was mild and sunshiny, and the whole population of the little patriarchate was
                  gathered on the green in front of the mansion, distributing Christmas presents
                  among the negroes. When we came in sight, from behind the thick cluster of
                  liveoaks which bordered the miniature lake, the whole assemblage sent up a glad
                  shout, and hurried up to welcome us. And such a welcome! As she sprang from the
                  carriage, Selma was caught in her father's arms, then in "master Joe's," and then,
                  encircled by a cloud of dark beauties, each vieing with the other in boisterous
                  expressions of affection, she was the victim of such a demonstration as would have
                  done the heart of Hogarth good to witness. In the midst of it a slight, delicate
                  woman rushed from the house, and, crowding into the thick group around Selma,
                  threw her arms about her neck, and, nearly smothering her with kisses,
                  exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"My chile! my chile! I sees you at last!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Phylly," said Selma, returning her caresses; "and haven't I grown? I thought
                  you wouldn't know me."</p>
               <p>"Know you! Ain't you my chile—my own dear chile!" and, pressing Selma's cheeks
                  between her two hands, and gazing at her beautiful face for a moment, she kissed
                  her over and over again.</p>
               <p>My arms had been nearly shaken off, when I noticed "Boss Joe" limping toward me,
                  his head uncovered, and his broad face shining from out his gray wool like the
                  full moon breaking through a mass of clouds.</p>
               <p>"How are you, old gentleman?" I exclaimed, grasping him warmly by the hand.</p>
               <p>"Right smart! right smart, massa Kirke. Glad you'm come, sar."</p>
               <p>"And you're home for Christmas?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, sar. I'se come ter see massa Robert, an' ter tend ter hirin' a new gang. But
                  darkies am high dis yar, sar."</p>
               <p>"How much are they?"</p>
               <p>"Well, dey ax, roun' yere, one fifty, an' 'spenses dar an' back; an' it'm a pile,
                  when you tink we hab used up 'most all de new trees."</p>
               <p>"But you must have many second-year cuttings."</p>
               <p>"Yas, right smart; but No. 2 rosum doan't pay at sech prices fur darkies."</p>
               <p>Turning to Preston in a moment, I said:</p>
               <p>"Do not let us interfere with the 'doin's'; it's just what we want to see."</p>
               <p>"Well, come, you folks," said Joe, hobbling back to the green; "leff us gwo on
                  now."</p>
               <p>Preston, Selma, and Phyllis went into the house, but the<pb n="188-189"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000095"/> rest of us followed the grinning group of Africans
                  to the centre of the lawn, where several large packing boxes, and a long table,
                  something like a carpenter's bench, were piled high with a miscellaneous
                  assortment of dry goods and groceries.</p>
               <p>"Now, all you dat hab heads, come up yere," shouted Joe, seating himself on the
                  bench; "but doan't all come ter onst."</p>
               <p>One by one the men and boys field past him, and, selecting a hat or cap from a
                  couple of boxes near, he adjusted a covering to each woolly cranium that presented
                  itself; interspersing the exercise with humorous remarks on their respective
                  phrenological developments:</p>
               <p>"Pomp, you's made fur a preacher, shore. Dat dar head ob your'n gwoes up jess like
                  a steeple. I'll hab ter gib you a cap, Dave; you'm so big ahind de yeres, none ob
                  dese hats'll fit, nohow. Jess show de back ob you' head to ony gemman, an' he'll
                  say you'm one ob de great ones ob de 'arth. None ob dese am big 'nuff fur you,
                  Ally," he continued, as a tall, well-clad mulatto man stepped up to him. "You'
                  bumps hab growed so sence you took ter de swamp, dat nuffin'll cober you 'cept
                  massa Robert's hat, or de gal Rosey's sunshade."</p>
               <p>The yellow man laughed, but kept on trying the hats. Finding one, at last, of
                  suitable dimensions, he turned away to make room for another candidate for cranial
                  honors. As I caught a full view of his face, I exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Why, Ally, is that you?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa; it'm me," he replied, making a respectful bow.</p>
               <p>"And you live here yet?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa. Hope you's well, massa?"</p>
               <p>"Very well. And your mother—how is she?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! she'm right smart, sar."</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa, I'se right smart; an' I'se bery glad ter see 'ou, massa," said a
                  voice at my elbow. It was Dinah, no longer clad in coarse osnaburg, but arrayed in
                  a worsted gown, and a little grayer and a little bulkier than when I saw her eight
                  years before.</p>
               <p>"Why, Dinah, how well you look!" I exclaimed, giving her my hand. "And you've come
                  up to spend Christmas with Ally?"</p>
               <p>"No, massa, I <emph>libs</emph> yere. I'se FREE now, massa!"</p>
               <p>"Free! So you've made enough to buy yourself? I'm glad to hear it."</p>
               <p>"No, massa. Ally—de good chile—he done it, massa."</p>
               <p>"Ally did it! How could he? He's not more than twenty now!"</p>
               <p>"No more'n he hain't, massa; but he'm two yar in massa Preston's swamp, wid a
                  hired gang. Massa Preston put de chile ober 'em, an' gib him a haff ob all he
                  make, an' he'm doin' a heap dar, massa."</p>
               <p>"And with his first earnings he bought his mother!"</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa; wid de bery fuss."</p>
               <p>"Ally, give me your hand," I exclaimed, with unaffected pleasure; "you're a man!
                  You're worthy of such a mother!"</p>
               <p>"Yas, he am dat, massa! He'm wordy ob onyting; an' he'm gwine ter hab a wife ter
                  day, massa. Boss Joe am gwine ter marry 'em, an' ter gib 'em him own cabin fur dar
                  Chrismus giff."</p>
               <p>"Well, Joe <emph>is</emph> a trump. I'll remember him in my will for that, aunty,
                  sure."</p>
               <p>"Dat'm bery good ob 'ou, massa; but I reckon 'ou can't<pb n="190-191"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000096"/> tink who Ally'm gwine ter hab, massa," said the old
                  woman, her face beaming all over.</p>
               <p>"No, I can't, Dinah. Who is she?"</p>
               <p>"It'm little Rosey, dat 'ou buy ob de trader, massa; an' she'm de pootiest little
                  gal all roun' yere; ebery one say dat massa."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! And they are to be married to-day?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa, ter day—dis evenin'. 'Ou'll be dar, woan't 'ou, massa?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, certainly I will."</p>
               <p>The old woman and Ally then mingled with the crowd of negroes, and I turned my
                  attention once more to Joe's operations. The men had been supplied with head gear,
                  and the women were receiving their turbans—gaudy pieces of red and yellow
                  muslin.</p>
               <p>"Now, all you boys an' gals," shouted Joe, as he dealt out a handkerchief to the
                  last of the dusky demoiselles, "you all squat on de groun', an' shovel off you'
                  shoes."</p>
               <p>Down they went in every conceivable attitude, and, uncovering their feet,
                  commenced pelting each other with the cast-off leathers. When the sport had lasted
                  a few minutes, Joe sang out:</p>
               <p>"Come! 'nuff ob dat; now ter bis'ness. Yere, you yaller monkeys" (to several
                  amalgamated specimens of white lead and Spanish brown), "tote dese 'mong 'em."</p>
               <p>The young chattels did as they were bidden, and, as each heavy brogan was fitted
                  to the pedal extremity of some one of the darkies, the newly-shod individual
                  sprang to his feet, and commenced dancing about as if he were the happiest mortal
                  in existence.</p>
               <p>"Dat'm it," shouted Joe; "frow up you' heels; an' some ob you gwo an' fotch de big
                  fiddle. We'll hab a dance, an' show dese Nordern gemmen de raal poker."</p>
               <p>"But we hain't hed de dresses—nor de soogar—nor de 'backer—nor none ob de
                  whiskey," cried a dozen voices.</p>
               <p>"Shet up, you brack crows! You can't hab anoder ting till ye'se hed a high ole
                  heel-scrapin'. Yere, massa Joe; you come up yere, an' holp me wid de
                  'strumentals," said Boss Joe grinning widely, and getting up on the carpenter's
                  bench.</p>
               <p>In a few moments, the "big fiddle," one or two smaller fiddles, and three or four
                  banjoes were brought out, and the two Joes, and several ebony gentlemen, seating
                  themselves on the boxes of clothing, began tuning the instruments. Soon "Boss Joe"
                  commenced sawing away with a gusto that might have been considered out of keeping
                  with his gray hairs, his sixty years, and his clerical profession. "Massa Joe" and
                  the others striking in, the male and female darkies paired off two by two, and to
                  a lively air began dancing a sort of "cotillion breakdown." Other dances followed,
                  in which the little negroes joined, and soon the air rang with the creak of the
                  fiddles and the merry shouts of the negroes. In the midst of it my arm was touched
                  lightly, and, turning round, I saw Rosey and Dinah.</p>
               <p>"I'se got de little gal yere, massa," said the latter, looking as proud as a hen
                  over her first brood of chickens. "She glad ter see 'ou, massa."</p>
               <p>I gave Rosey my hand, and made a few good-natured compliments on her beauty and
                  her tidy appearance. She had a simple, guileless expression, and met my
                  half-bantering remarks with an innocent frankness that charmed me. She was only<pb
                     n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6528-00000097"/> sixteen, but had developed into a
                  beautiful woman. Her form was slight and graceful, with just enough <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">embonpoint</foreign> to give the appearance of full health; and
                  her thin, delicate features, large, wide-set eyes, and clear, rosy complexion,
                  bore a strong resemblance to Selma's. It was evident they were children of the
                  same father; and yet, one was to be the wife of a poor negro, the other to marry
                  the son of a "merchant prince."</p>
               <p>As the dancing concluded, Boss Joe's fiddle gave out a dying scream, and, turning
                  to me, he sang out:</p>
               <p>"War dar eber sprightlier nigs dan dese, massa Kirke? Doan't dey beat you' country
                  folks all holler?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, they do, Joe. They handle their heels as nimbly as elephants."</p>
               <p>I spoke the truth; most of then did.</p>
               <p>The distribution of the presents was resumed; and, as each negro received his full
                  supply of flour, sugar, tea, coffee, molasses, tobacco, and calico, grinning with
                  joy over his new acquisitions, he staggered off to his quarters. When the last box
                  was nearly emptied, with young Preston and Frank, I adjourned to the mansion.</p>
               <p>The exterior of the "great house" was unchanged, but its interior had undergone a
                  complete transformation. The plain oak flooring of the hall had been replaced by
                  porcelain tiling, and the neat, simple furniture of the parlors by huge mirrors;
                  rosewood and brocatelle sofas and lounges; velvet tapestry carpets, in which one's
                  feet sank almost out of sight; and immense paintings, whose aggregate cost might
                  have paid off one half of the mortgage that encumbered the plantation.</p>
               <p>Selma and her father were engaged in earnest conversation when we entered the
                  drawing room, and, being unwilling ing to interrupt them, I was about to retire,
                  but he rose, and said:</p>
               <p>"Come in, Kirke; I will call Mrs. Preston. She will be glad to see you."</p>
               <p>The lady soon entered. It was eight years since we had met, but time had touched
                  her gently. Her face wore its old, decided, yet quiet expression, and her manner
                  showed the easy self-possession I had noticed at our first interview. She was
                  richly dressed, and had on a heavy satin pelisse, and a blue velvet bonnet, as if
                  about to ride out.</p>
               <p>When the usual greetings were over, she remarked:</p>
               <p>"You have been here some time, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam; we arrived about two hours ago; but I met some old friends outside,
                  and the pleasure of seeing them has made me a little tardy in paying my respects
                  to you."</p>
               <p>"The negroes, you mean, sir," she replied, with a slight toss of the head, and a
                  look of cool dignity which well became her.</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam; I have many friends among the blacks. On some plantations they look
                  for my coming as they do for Christmas."</p>
               <p>"It is quite rare to meet a white gentleman so fond of negroes," she rejoined,
                  with an air slightly more supercilious.</p>
               <p>I remembered her as the humble schoolmistress, whose entire possessions were
                  packed in one trunk; and, forgetting myself, said, in a tone which bore a slight
                  trace of indignation:</p>
               <p>"More rare, I fear, than it should be; but you and I, madam, who are Yankees, and
                  have 'worked for a living,' cannot surely despise the negroes because they are
                     <emph>compelled</emph> to work for theirs."</p>
               <pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6528-00000098"/>
               <p>"Oh! no, sir; not by any means! But you must excuse me; the carriage is waiting to
                  take me to church;" and, rising, she bowed herself stiffly out of the door.</p>
               <p>"Ah, you hit her there!" exclaimed Joe, springing to his feet in great glee, and
                  striding to the window. "See here, Mr. Kirke! See what a turnout the Yankee
                  'schulemarm' has worried out of father!"</p>
               <p>"My son, you must not speak so; she is your mother!" said Preston.</p>
               <p>"No, I'm d—d if she is! Call her anything but that, father; that's——" He checked
                  himself; but I thought he would have added, "an insult to my dead mother!"</p>
               <p>Preston made no reply.</p>
               <p>Looking out of the window, I saw Mrs. Preston being handed into a magnificent
                  barouche by one of the black gentry she so much despised. Another, in gaudy gold
                  livery, sat on the box; and a mounted outrider, also bound up in gold braid, stood
                  behind the carriage.</p>
               <p>"There's a two-thousand-dollar turnout, and two fifteen-hundred-dollar niggers to
                  tote a woman who ought to go afoot. It's a poor investment, I swear," said Joe,
                  turning away from the window.</p>
               <p>Preston made no reply; but I laughingly remarked:</p>
               <p>"Come, Joe, she isn't <emph>your</emph> wife. Let your father spend his money as
                  he pleases; he can afford it."</p>
               <p>"He <emph>can't</emph> afford it; that woman is running him to the devil at a
                  two-forty gait. You have more influence with him than any one, Mr. Kirke;
                     <emph>do</emph> try to stop it!"</p>
               <p>The young man spoke in a decided but regretful tone, and his manner showed more
                  respect to his father than his words implied. Unwilling to interfere in such an
                  affair, I said nothing; but Preston, in a moment, remarked:</p>
               <p>"It is true, Kirke! Her extravagance has ruined my credit at home, and forced me
                  to use Joe's indorsements. Besides, I have had to borrow ten thousand dollars of
                  him to keep my head above water."</p>
               <p>[Mr. James Preston—the Squire's uncle—had died the year before, and the young man
                  had succeeded to his large property and business.]</p>
               <p>I was thunderstruck; but, before I could reply, Joe said:</p>
               <p>"I don't care a rush for the money. Father can have every dollar I've got; but I
                     <emph>do</emph> want to see him rid of that woman. I've been here sick for two
                  months, and I've seen the whole. She is worrying the very life out of him. She's
                  made him an old man at forty."</p>
               <p>It was true. His face was lean and haggard, and his hair already thickly streaked
                  with white.</p>
               <p>Preston rose, and, walking the room, said:</p>
               <p>"But what am I to do? You yourself, Joe, would not have all this made public.
                  You've as much pride about it as I have."</p>
               <p>"I've not a bit of pride about it, father; and it's public now. Everybody knows
                  it, and everybody says you ought to cut her adrift."</p>
               <p>"What had I better do? Tell me, my friend," said Preston, still walking the
                  room.</p>
               <p>"I cannot advise you, Preston. An outsider should express no opinion on such
                  matters."</p>
               <p>In a moment, Preston said:</p>
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6528-00000099"/>
               <p>"Well, Joe, no more of this now. I'll do what is right, however much it may wound
                  my pride."</p>
               <p>The conversation turned to other subjects, till Mrs. Preston's return from church,
                  shortly after which dinner was announced. The lady presided at the table with as
                  much ease and grace as if she had been born to the position; and, in her charming
                  conversation, I almost forgot the revelations of the morning. The rest of the day
                  I spent with Joe and Frank, strolling over the plantation, and mingling with the
                  negroes, who, freed from work, were enjoying themselves in a very "miscellaneous
                  manner." Preston remained at the house with Selma.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <head type="sub">FAMILY JARS.</head>
               <p>IT was nearly dark when we returned to the mansion. Looking in at the parlor, and
                  not finding his father there, Joe led the way at once to the library. The door was
                  ajar, and, as we entered the passage way, loud voices were issuing from it.</p>
               <p>"I tell you, Mr. Preston, I am mistress of this plantation. He shall NOT go!"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, madam, he <emph>shall,</emph> and to-night," returned a mild but
                  decided voice, which I recognized as Preston's. Being unwilling to overhear more,
                  I turned away, but Joe caught me by the arm, exclaiming:</p>
               <p>"If you are my father's friend, go in. If you don't, he will back down; he has
                  done so forty times."</p>
               <p>Preston was a man of more than ordinary firmness, but his wife had the stronger
                  will. She seemed possessed of a sort of magnetic power, which enabled her to
                  control others almost arbitrarily.</p>
               <p>Reluctantly I followed the young man into the room. Preston was seated before the
                  fire, and Selma, with her arm about his neck, was standing near him. Mulock,
                  better clad than when I witnessed his purchase by the "fast" young planter, but
                  wearing a sullen, dogged expression, was leaning<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000100"/> against the centre table; and Mrs. Preston,
                  gesticulating wildly, and her face glowing with mingled rage and defiance, stood
                  within a few feet of her husband. Not heeding our entrance, she exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> have my way. If you send him off, I will never darken your
                  doors again."</p>
               <p>"That is as you please, madam," replied Preston. "Mr. Kirke and Frank, pray be
                  seated."</p>
               <p>Stung by her husband's coolness, the lady turned fiercely upon Joe, and, shaking
                  her clenched hand in his face, cried out:</p>
               <p>"This is <emph>your</emph> work. I will teach you better than to meddle in my
                  affairs."</p>
               <p>"Madam, you act well," said the young man, taking a step toward the door. "Pray
                  come out to the quarters; poor as they are, every negro will give a bit to see
                     <emph>you</emph> play."</p>
               <p>In uncontrollable rage, she struck him a smart blow in the face, and rushed from
                  the room.</p>
               <p>When she had gone, Preston turned to Mulock:</p>
               <p>"Now go. The amount due you I shall retain to offset, in part, what you have
                  tempted the negroes to steal. You can come here once a week—on Sunday—to see
                  Phylly; but if you have any more dealings with the hands, I will prosecute you on
                  the instant."</p>
               <p>Mulock rose, put on his slouched hat, and, a dull fire burning in his cold,
                  snakelike eyes, slowly said:</p>
               <p>"Wall, Squire, I'll gwo; but 'counts 'tween you an' me ain't settled yit."</p>
               <p>As he went, Selma leaned forward, and, kissing Preston's cheek, said:</p>
               <p>"O father! I'm so glad <emph>you</emph> didn't speak harshly to her."</p>
               <p>Preston put his arm about her, and replied:</p>
               <p>"You helped me, my child. I should be a better, happier man, if you were with
                  me."</p>
               <p>"And I will be, father; I won't go away any more."</p>
               <p>"But Frank?" said Preston, again kissing her.</p>
               <p>"Oh! you know we're not to be married for a good while yet. I'll stay with you
                     <emph>till then,</emph> father."</p>
               <p>"Ah! there she goes," said Joe, looking out at the window, which commanded a view
                  of the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">porte cochere;</foreign> "she can't get to Newbern
                  till ten; but the night air won't hurt <emph>her.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Then she makes Newbern her home?"</p>

                   in the little church; and, directly after supper, we all went to the
                  wedding. The seats had been removed from the centre of the building, for, though
                  duly consecrated to the use of the saints, the sinners were to exercise their
                  heels in it after the ceremony was over. At its farther extremity, the carpenter's
                  bench of which I have spoken, elongated at both ends, and covered with a white
                  table cloth, was piled high with eatables; indicating that a time of "great
                  refreshment" was at hand. The bounteous supply of ham, chicken, wild duck, roast
                  pig, fish, hoecake, wheat bread, tea, coffee, milk, and pumpkin and sweet-potato
                  pies, under which the bench groaned, showed that some liberal hand had catered for
                  the occasion.</p>

               <p>Black Joe, dressed in his "Sunday best," was seated on the rustic settee at the
                  back of the desk, and Phyllis and Dinah occupied chairs inside the low railing
                  which faced the pulpit. Phyllis looked careworn and sad, but Ally's mother was as
                  radiant as a brass kettle in a blaze of light wood. She wore a white dress,
                  stiffly starched, and expanded by immense hoops, and a crimped nightcap, whose
                  broad border flapped about like the wings of a crowing rooster; and she looked,
                  for all the world, like a black ghost in a winding sheet, escaped from below, and
                  bound on a "good time generally." Two "shining lights," on either side of the
                  pulpit, held aloft blazing torches of pine, illuminating the sea of grinning
                  darkness, and sending up a smoke like that arising from the pit which is said to
                  be bottomless. About a hundred darkies were present; and the number of glossy
                  coats, fancy turbans, gaudy bonnets, red shawls, and flaming dresses, which the
                  light disclosed, was amazing. The poor worm that grubbed in the earth had appeared
                  ("for that occasion only") as a butterfly; and Lazarus, rid of his rags, had come
                  forth dressed like a Broadway dandy.</p>
               <p>Any person of sensitive olfactories would have halted in the doorway; but I
                  elbowed through the woolly gathering, and followed Frank and Selma to the family
                  pew. Tittering, laughing, and flaunting their red and yellow kerchiefs, the black
                  people were enjoying themselves amazingly, when "Dar dey comes," "Dar'm de happy
                  pussons," went round the assemblage, and the bride and groom, attended by two
                  sable couples, entered the building. After some ludicrous mistakes, they got "into
                  position" in front of the railing, and Black Joe took a stand before them.</p>
               <p>Rosey was dressed in white, with a neat fillet of pink and blue ribbon about her
                  head; and Ally wore a black frock coat, with white vest, and white cotton gloves.
                  One of the groomsmen—a rustic beau from a neighboring plantation—wore an immensely
                  long-tailed blue coat with brass buttons, a flaming<pb n="202-203"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000102"/> red waistcoat, yellow woollen mittens, and a
                  neckerchief that looked like a secession flag hugging a lamppost. Both of these
                  gentry had hats of stovepipe pattern, very tall, and with narrow brims; and—they
                  wore them during the ceremony.</p>
               <p>"Silence in de meetin'," cried Joe.</p>
               <p>The boisterous sea of black wool subsided to a dead calm. Those not already
                  standing, rose, and Joe commenced reading the marriage service of the Episcopal
                  Church.</p>
               <p>The parties immediately interested appeared to have conned their lessons well, for
                  they made all the responses with great propriety; but some of the congregation
                  seemed less familiar with the service. When Joe repeated the words, "If ony man
                  kin show cause why dese folks should not be lawfully jined togedder, leff him now
                  speak, or else foreber hole his peace," Dinah turned to the audience, and cried
                  out:</p>
               <p>"Yas, jess leff him come out wid it <emph>now.</emph> I'd like ter see de man
                  dat's got onyting agin it."</p>
               <p>No one appeared to have "onyting agin it," and Joe proceeded to read the words: "I
                  require and charge you, if either of you know any impediment," etc. In the midst
                  of it, a voice called out:</p>
               <p>"Dar ain't no 'pedimen', Boss Joe; I knows dat. Gwo on, sar!" "Dat's so, brudder,"
                  said another voice. "Dat's de Lord's trufh," echoed a third. "Doan't be 'sturbin'
                  de meetin'; de young folks want de splicin' done," cried a fourth; and "Amen,"
                  shouted a dozen.</p>
               <p>"Shet up, all on you!" yelled Joe, turning on them with an imperious gesture. "Ef
                  you hain't no more manners dan dat, clar out."</p>
               <p>Silence soon ensued, and Joe went on without interruption to the place where the
                  minister asks the bridegroom: "Wilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife?" Then
                  Dinah, unable to contain herself longer, joyfully exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Ob course he will! Ony youn' feller'd be glad to hab <emph>har.</emph>"</p>
               <p>[Never having gone through the ceremony herself, the poor woman could not be
                  expected to know what was appropriate to the occasion.]</p>
               <p>No further interruption occurred, and soon the happy couple were "bone of one
                  bone, and flesh of one flesh." The assemblage still standing, Joe then turned to
                  Ally and Rosey, and, with a manner so solemn and impressive that he seemed
                  altogether a different person from the merry darky who had entered so heartily
                  into the "high ole heel-scrapin'" of the morning, he spoke somewhat as
                  follows:</p>
               <p>"My chil'ren, lub one anoder; bar wid one anoder; be faithful ter one anoder. You
                  hab started on a long journey, many rough places am in de road; many trubbles will
                  spring up by de wayside; but gwo on hand an' hand togedder; lub one anoder, an',

                  eberyting, in de bery darkest days, de sun ob joy an' peace hab broke fru de
                  clouds, an' sent him blessed rays inter our hearts. We started jess like two young

                  bushes, an' de ugly forns—dem war our bad ways—war atween us; but lub, like de
                  sun, shone down on us, an' we grow'd. We grow'd till our heads got above de
                  bushes; till dis little branch an' dat little branch—dem war our holy feelin's—put
                  out toward one anoder, an' we come closer an' closer togedder. An' dough we'm ole
                  trees now, an' sometime de wind blow, an' de storm rage fru de tops, an' freaten
                  ter tear off de limbs, an' ter pull up de bery roots, we'm growin' closer an'
                  closer, an' nearer an' nearer togedder ebery day. An' soon de ole tops will meet;
                  soon de ole branches, all cobered ober wid de gray moss, will twine roun' one

                  neber'll beat; whar we shill blossom an' bar fruit ter de glory ob de Lord, an' in
                  His heabenly kingdom foreber!</p>
               <p>"Yas, my chil'ren, you hab started on a long journey, an' nuffin' will git you fru
                  it but <emph>lub.</emph> Nuffin' will hole you up, nuffin' will keep you faithful
                  ter one anoder, nuffin' will make you bar wid one anoder, but dat. None ob us kin
                  lib widout it; but married folks want it most ob all. Dey need it more dan de
                  bread dey eat, de water dey drink, or de air dey breafe. De worle couldn't gwo on
                  widout it. De bery sun would gwo out in de heabens, but fur dat! An' shill I tell
                  you why? You hab heerd massa Robert talk 'bout de great law dat make de apple fall
                  from de tree, de rock sink in de water; dat bines our feet ter de roun' 'arth, so
                  we doan't drap off as it gwo fru de air; dat holes de sun an' de stars in dar
                  'pointed places, so dat, day after day, an' yar after yar, dough dey'm trabblin'
                  fasser dan de lightnin' eber went, dey'm right whar dey should be. He call it
                  'traction, an' all de great men call it so; but dat ain't de name! It am LUB. It
                  am GOD, fur GOD am lub, an' lub am GOD; an' lub bines de whole creashun togedder!
                  An' shill I tell you how it do it? Does you see dis hand? how I open de fingers;
                  how I shet'm up; how I rise de whole arm? Does you see dis foot, dat I does wid
                  jess de same? Does you see dis whole body—how I make it, in a twinklin', do jess
                  what I like? Now, what am it dat make my hand move, an' my whole body turn roun'
                  so sudden, dat I'se only ter say, 'Do it,' an' it'm done? Why, it am ME. It'm
                     <emph>me,</emph> dat libs up yere in de brain, an' sends my <emph>will</emph>
                  fru ebery part—fru ebery siner, an' ebery muscle, an' ebery little jint, an'
                  make'm all do jess what I like. Now, man am made in de image ob GOD, an' dis pore,
                  weak ole body am a small pattern ob de whole creashun. Eberyting gwo on jess as
                     <emph>it</emph> do. Eberyting am held togedder, an' moved 'bout, jess as
                     <emph>it</emph> am; but it'm GOD dat move it, not me! He libs up dar in de
                  sky—which am His brain—wid de stars fur His hands, de planets fur His feet, an' de
                  whole univarse fur His body; an' He sends His will—which am lub—fru ebery part ob
                  de whole, an' moves it 'bout, an' make it do jess as He likes. So you see it am my
                  will, sent fru ebery muscle an' ebery little siner, dat moves my body; so it am
                     <emph>His</emph> will, sent fru what do 'stronomers an' de poets call de

                  de stars, an' you an' me, an' ebery libin' ting in all creashun! His will move 'em
                  all; AN' HIS WILL AM LUB! An' doan't you see dat you can't do widout His lub? dat
                  it am de bery breaf ob life? dat, ef it war tooken 'way from you, fur jess one
                  moment, you'd drap<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6528-00000104"/> down, an' die, an'
                  neber come ter life agin—no, not in dis worle, nor in any oder worle? It am so, my
                  chil'ren; an' de more you hab ob dat lub, de happier you'll be; de more you'll lub
                  one anoder; de easier you'll gwo fru you' life; de more joyfuller you'll meet you'
                  deafh; de happier you'll be all fru de long, long ages dat'm comin' in de great

                  you lub GOD; an' you can't lub Him widout you lub one anoder!"</p>
               <p>When Joe concluded, he saluted the bride in a manner that many another sooty
                  gentleman present would have been very glad to imitate, and then took a stand at
                  the head of the supper table. An immense tureen, filled with steaming oysters, was
                  soon brought in and placed before him, and, looking up, he said grace; thanking
                  Him who feedeth the ravens for putting it into his master's heart to feed His
                  other black creatures, the darkies present on that occasion. He asked for his
                  master many a happy "Chrismus down yere," and an eternal "Chrismus in heaben," and
                  he added: "An', knowin' dat Dou hatest long prayers, an' long faces, an' dose
                  folks dat gwo 'bout grumblin', as ef Dy happy 'arth war nuffin' but a graveyard;
                  leff us enjoy dis feast an' dis day as Dy true chil'ren—de chil'ren ob a good
                  Fader, who am all joy an' all gladness; an', while we'm eatin' an' drinkin' an'
                  dancin', may we make merry in our hearts ter <emph>Dee.</emph> Amen."</p>
               <p>As he concluded, Preston stepped to his side, and, taking the big ladle from his
                  hand, said:</p>
               <p>"Stand aside, Joe; you have done enough work for tonight;" then, turning to "we
                  white folks" in the family pew, he added: "If any man among you would be master,
                  let him now be the servant of all. Let him try his hand at the waiter business,
                  and see if he can't throw these shady people into the <emph>shade.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Massa Joe" and I went forward, and, tying the negroes' aprons about our waists,
                  took appropriate places beside the table.</p>
               <p>"Now all of you find seats," cried Preston; and, amid a hurricane of giggling and
                  merry laughter, the black people seated themselves on the floor, on the platform,
                  and on the row of benches ranged along the walls. Preston proceeded to fill up the
                  bowls with the savory stew, and we dispensed the eatables among them, and for half
                  an hour I witnessed as much enjoyment as often falls to the lot of black sinners
                  in this "vale of tears."</p>
               <p>"Now, ef dis doan't beat all!" exclaimed old Dinah, as I handed her a huge chunk
                  of gingerbread; "ef 'ou ain't right smart at waitin', massa Kirke, I'd like ter
                  know it."</p>
               <p>"Keep dark, ole 'ooman," shouted Black Joe; "doan't you say nuffin' 'bout dat, or
                  de traders'll hab a hole ob him. He'd sell fur a right likely hand,
                     <emph>shore.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I woan't do nuffin' <emph>but</emph> keep dark, Boss Joe," rejoined Dinah,
                  grinning till her face opened from ear to ear. "I'll hab 'ou know, sar, dat nary
                  ones but white ladies paints!"</p>
               <p>"Good fur you, ole lady," cried the preacher. "After dat you'll gib me de pleasure
                  ob your hand in de fuss dance."</p>
               <p>"Ob course I will, <emph>mister</emph> Joe; an' ef 'ou'm tired ob de ole 'ooman,
                  I'll gib 'ou my han' in anoder dance."</p>
               <p>"No, you woan't; I doan't gwo fur second marridges," rejoined Joe, looking slyly
                  at Preston; "dey ain't made in heaben."</p>
               <pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC6528-00000105"/>
               <p>"No more dey ain't," said the old woman, heaving a long sigh, and also looking at
                  Preston.</p>
               <p>"You ain't a gwine ter leff dese folks dance in de church, am you, Boss Joe?"
                  asked a prim, demure-looking darky, in a black suit, with a white neckerchief and
                  stiff shirt collar; probably some neighboring preacher.</p>
               <p>"I reckon so," replied Joe, dryly.</p>
               <p>"An' <emph>I</emph> reckons so, too, Mister I-scare-'ou-out (Iscariot)," cried the
                  old negress. "Ain't de planets de Lord's feet, an' doan't dey dance? I reckons we
                  ain't no better dan de Lord am an' ef He mobes him feet, 'ou'd better mobe 'our'n.
                     <emph>We</emph> b'lieve in sarvin' HIM wid our han's, an' our feet, too; we
                  does, Mister I-scare-'ou-out."</p>
               <p>She did scare him out, for the "pious gemman" left suddenly.</p>
               <p>When about all of the eatables had found their way down the cavernous—and
                  ravenous—throats of the darkies, Boss Joe rose, and called out:</p>
               <p>"Yere, you massa Joe, you pull off you' apern, an' take de big fiddle. I'm 'gaged
                  fur de fuss dance."</p>
               <p>Young Preston seated himself on the platform, and several sable gentlemen, with
                  banjoes and fiddles, took places beside him.</p>
               <p>"Now all you men folks s'lect you' pardners," cried the preacher, taking Dinah by
                  the hand, and leading her out to the middle of the floor.</p>
               <p>They all paired off, the fiddles broke into a merry tune, and soon the little
                  church, which had so often echoed with the groans of the saints, shook with the
                  heels of the sinners. When the first dance was over, Boss Joe again called
                  out:</p>
               <p>"Now, massa Joe, strike up de wal'z; Dinah an' I am gwine ter show dese folks some
                  highfalutin dancin'."</p>
               <p>The waltz struck up, and off they whirled. Dinah went into it as if she were
                  working for pay; and as Joe held her closely in his arms, her wide hoops expanded
                  till she looked like a topsail schooner scudding under bare poles.</p>
               <p>While Joe was wiping the perspiration from his face, at the end of the waltz, an
                  old negro entered, and whispered something in his ear. Joe's countenance fell,
                  and, without saying a word, he left the room.</p>
               <p>"Massa Joe," relinquishing the big fiddle, then took the floor with Rosey, and
                  gave the audience a genuine breakdown. His heels bobbed about like balls at a
                  cricket match, and Rosey's petticoats fluttered like the contents of a clothes
                  line caught out in a hurricane. A better-looking couple were never seen in a ball
                  room.</p>
               <p>"He's a natural born darky," said his father, laughing; "he takes to dancing as a
                  duck takes to water."</p>
               <p>A general dance followed. In the midst of it the old negro who had called Joe out,
                  again came in, and, making his way to where Preston and I were standing, he said,
                  in a low tone:</p>
               <p>"Massa Robert, ole Jack am dyin'; will 'ou come?"</p>
               <p>"Dying!" exclaimed Preston. "Yes, I'll be there at once. Kirke, you remember the
                  old man; come with me."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <head type="sub">A DEATHBED.</head>
               <p>THE moon and the stars were out, and the tall, dark pines cast long, gloomy
                  shadows over the little rows of negro houses which formed the rearguard to
                  Preston's mansion. They were nearly deserted. Not a solitary fire slumbered on the
                  bare clay hearths, and not a single darky stood sentry over the loose pork and
                  neglected hoecakes, or kept at bay the army of huge rats and prowling opossums
                  which beleaguered the quarters. Silence—death's music—was over and around them.
                  The noisy revelry of the dancers had died away in the distance, and even the
                  hoarse song of the great trees had sunk to a low moan, as they stood, motionless
                  and abashed, in the presence of the grim giant who knocks alike at the palace and
                  the cottage gate.</p>
               <p>A stray light glimmered through the logs of a low hut, far off in the woods, and,
                  making our way to it, we entered. A bright fire lit up the interior, and on a rude
                  cot, in one corner, lay the old preacher. His eyes were closed; a cold, clammy
                  sweat was on his forehead—he was dying. One of his skeleton hands rested on the
                  tattered coverlet, and his weazened face was half buried in a dilapidated pillow,
                  whose ragged casing and protruding plumage bespoke it a relic of some departed
                  white sleeper.</p>
               <p>An old negress, with gray hair and haggard visage, sat at the foot of the bed,
                  wailing piteously; and Joe and half a dozen aged saints stood around, singing a
                  hymn, doleful enough to have made even a sinner weep.</p>
               <p>Not heeding our entrance, Joe took the dying man by the hand, and, in a slow,
                  solemn voice, said:</p>
               <p>"Brudder Jack, you'm dyin'; you'm gwine ter dat lan' whence no trabeller returns;
                  you'm settin' out fur dat country which'm lit by de smile ob de Lord; whar dar
                  ain't no sickness, no pain, no sorrer, no dyin'; fur dat kingdom whar de Lord
                  reigns; whar trufh flows on like a riber; whar righteousness springs up like de
                  grass, an' lub draps down like de dew, an' cobers de face ob de groun'; whar you
                  woan't gwo 'bout wid no crutch; whar you woan't lib in no ole cabin like dis, an'
                  eat hoecake an' salt pork in sorrer an' heabiness ob soul; but whar you'll run an'
                  not be weary, an' walk an' not be faint; whar you'll hab a hous'n builded ob de
                  Lord, an' sit at His table—you' meat an' drink de bread an' de water ob life!</p>
               <p>"I knows you's a sinner, Jack; I knows you's lub'd de hot water too much, an' dat
                  it make you forgit you' duty sometime, an' set a bad 'zample ter dem as looked up
                  ter you fur better tings; but dar am mercy wid de Lord, Jack; dar am forgibness
                  wid Him; an' I hopes you'm ready an' willin' ter gwo."</p>
               <p>Old Jack opened his eyes, and, in a low, peevish tone, said:</p>
               <p>"Joe, none ob you' nonsense ter me! I'se hard you talk dis way afore.
                     <emph>You</emph> can't preach—you neber could. You jess knows I ain't fit ter
                  trabble, an' I ain't willin' ter gwo, nowhar."</p>
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6528-00000107"/>
               <p>Joe mildly rebuked him, and again commenced expatiating on the "upper kingdom,"
                  and on the glories of "the house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens;" but
                  the old darky cut him short, with—</p>
               <p>"Shet up, Joe! no more ob dat. I doan't want no oder hous'n but dis—dis ole cabin
                  am good 'nuff fur me."</p>
               <p>Joe was about to reply, when Preston stepped to the bedside, and, taking the aged
                  preacher's hand, said:</p>
               <p>"My good Jack, master Robert has come to see you."</p>
               <p>The dying man turned his eyes toward his master, and, in a weak, tremulous voice,
                  exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Oh! massa Robert, has <emph>you</emph> come? has you come ter see ole Jack? Bress
                  you, massa Robert, bress you! Jack know'd you'd neber leab him yere ter die
                  alone."</p>
               <p>"No, my good Jack; I would save you, if I could."</p>
               <p>"But you can't sabe me, massa Robert; I'se b'yond dat. I'se dyin', massa Robert.
                  I'se gwine ter de good missus. She tell'd me ter git ready ter foller har, an' I
                  is. I'se gwine ter har now, massa Robert!"</p>
               <p>"I know you are, Jack. I feel <emph>sure</emph> you are."</p>
               <p>"Tank you, massa Robert—tank you fur sayin' dat. An' woan't you pray fur me, massa
                  Robert—jess a little pray? De good man's prayer am h'ard, you knows, massa
                  Robert!"</p>
               <p>All kneeling down on the rough floor, Preston prayed—a short, simple, fervent
                  prayer. At its close, he rose, and, bending over the old negro, said:</p>
               <p>"The Lord is good, Jack; His mercy is everlasting."</p>
               <p>"I knows dat; I feels dat," gasped the dying man. "I lubs you, massa Robert; I
                  allers lub'd you; but I'se gwine ter leab you now. Bress you! de Lord bress you,
                  massa Robert! I'll tell de good missus——"</p>
               <p>He clutched convulsively at his master's hand; a wild light came out of his eyes;
                  a sudden spasm passed over his face, and—he was "gone whar de good darkies
                  go."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <head type="sub">SOUTHERN CHIVALRY.</head>
               <p>ON the following day, Frank and I were to resume our journey; and, in the morning,
                  I suggested that we should visit Colonel Dawsey, with whom, though he had for many
                  years been a correspondent of the house in which I was a partner, I had no
                  personal acquaintance.</p>
               <p>His plantation adjoined Preston's, and his house was only a short half mile from
                  my friend's. After breakfast, we set out for it through the woods. The day was
                  cold for the season, with a sharp, nipping air, and our overcoats were not at all
                  uncomfortable.</p>
               <p>As we walked along, I said to Preston:</p>
               <p>"Dawsey's 'account' is a good one. He never draws against shipments, but holds on,
                  and sells sight drafts, thus making the exchange."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I know; he's a close calculator."</p>
               <p>"Does he continue to manage his negroes as formerly?"</p>
               <p>"In much the same way, I reckon."</p>
               <p>"Then he can't stand remarkably well with his neighbors."</p>
               <p>"Oh! people round here don't mind such things. Many of them do as badly as he.
                  Besides, Dawsey is a gentleman of good family. He inherited his plantation and two
                  hundred hands."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! How, then, did he become reduced to his present number?"</p>
               <p>"He was a wild young fellow, and, before he was twenty-five, had squandered and
                  gambled away everything but his land and some thirty negroes. Then he turned
                  square round, and, from being prodigal and careless, became mean and cruel. He has
                  a hundred now, and more ready money than any planter in the district."</p>
               <p>A half hour's walk took us to Dawsey's negro quarters—a collection of about thirty
                  low huts in the rear of his house. They were not so poor as some I had seen on
                  cotton and rice plantations, but they seemed unfit for the habitation of any
                  animal but the hog. Their floors were the bare ground, hardened by being moistened
                  with water and pounded with mauls; and worn, as they were, several inches lower in
                  the centre than at the sides, they must have formed, in rainy weather, the beds of
                  small lakes. So much water would have been objectionable to white tenants; but
                  negroes, like their friends the alligators, are amphibious animals; and Dawsey's
                  were never known to make complaint. The chimneys were often merely vent-holes in
                  the roof, though a few were tumbledown structures of sticks and clay; and not a
                  window, nor an opening which courtesy could have christened a window, was to be
                  seen in the entire collection. And, for that matter, windows were useless, for the
                  wide crevices in the logs, which let in the air and rain, at the same time might
                  admit the light. Two or three low beds at one end, a small pine bench, which held
                  half a dozen wooden plates and spoons, and a large iron pot, resting on four
                  stones over a low fire, and serving for both washtub and cook-kettle, composed the
                  furniture of each interior.</p>
               <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6528-00000109"/>
               <p>No one of the cabins was over sixteen feet square, but each was "home" and
                  "shelter" for three or four human beings. Walking on a short distance, we came to
                  a larger hovel, in front of which about a dozen young chattels were playing. Seven
                  or eight more, too young to walk, were crawling about on the ground inside. They
                  had only one garment apiece—a long shirt of coarse linsey—and their heads and feet
                  were bare. An old negress was seated in the doorway, knitting. Approaching her, I
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Aunty, are not these children cold?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! no, massa; dey'm use' ter de wedder."</p>
               <p>"Do you take care of all of them?"</p>
               <p>"In de daytime I does, massa. In de night dar mudders takes de small 'uns."</p>
               <p>"But some of them are white. Those two are as white as I am!"</p>
               <p>"No, massa; dey'm brack. Ef you looks at dar eyes an' dar finger nails, you'll see
                  dat."</p>
               <p>"They're black, to be sure they are," said young Preston, laughing; "but they're
                  about as white as Dawsey, and look wonderfully like him—eh, Aunty Sue?"</p>
               <p>"I reckons, massa Joe!" replied the woman, running her hand through her wool, and
                  grinning widely.</p>
               <p>"What does he ask for <emph>them,</emph> aunty?"</p>
               <p>"Doan't know, massa, but 'spect dey'm pooty high. Dem kine am hard ter raise."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Joe; "white blood—even Dawsey's—don't take naturally to mud."</p>
               <p>"I reckons not, massa Joe!" said the old negress, with another grin.</p>
               <p>Joe gave her a half-dollar piece, and, amid an avalanche of blessings, we passed
                  on to Dawsey's "mansion"—if mansion it could be called—a story-and-a-half shanty,
                  about thirty feet square, covered with rough, unpainted boards, and lit by two
                  small, dingy windows. It was approached by a sandy walk, and the ground around its
                  front entrance was littered with apple peelings, potato parings, and the refuse of
                  the culinary department.</p>
               <p>Joe rapped at the door, and, in a moment, it opened, and a middle-aged mulatto
                  woman appeared. As soon as she perceived Preston, she grasped his two hands, and
                  exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Oh! massa Robert, <emph>do</emph> buy har! Massa'll kill har, ef you doan't."</p>
               <p>"But I can't, Dinah. Your master refuses my note, and I haven't the money
                  now."</p>
               <p>"Oh! oh! He'll kill har; he say he will. She woan't gib in ter him, an' he'll kill
                  har, <emph>shore.</emph> Oh! oh!" cried the woman, wringing her hands, and
                  bursting into tears.</p>
               <p>"Is it 'Spasia?" asked Joe.</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa Joe; "it'm 'Spasia. Massa hab sole yaller Tom 'way from har, an' he
                  swar he'll kill har 'case she woan't gib in ter him. Oh! oh!"</p>
               <p>"Where is your master?"</p>
               <p>"He'm 'way wid har an' Black Cale. I reckon dey'm down ter de branch. I reckon
                  dey'm whippin' on har <emph>now!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Come, Frank," cried Joe, starting off at a rapid pace; "let's see that
                  performance."</p>
               <p>"Hold on, Joe; wait for us. You'll get into trouble!" shouted his father, hurrying
                  after him. The rest of us caught up with them in a few moments, and then all
                  walked rapidly<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6528-00000110"/> on in the direction of
                  the small run which borders the two plantations.</p>
               <p>Before we had gone far, we heard loud screams, mingled with oaths and the heavy
                  blows of a whip. Quickening our pace, we soon reached the bank of the little
                  stream, which there was lined with thick underbrush. We could see no one, and the
                  sounds had subsided. In a moment, however, a rough voice called out from behind
                  the bushes:</p>
               <p>"Have you had enough? Will you give up?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! no, good massa; I can't do dat!" was the half-sobbing, half-moaning
                  reply.</p>
               <p>"Give it to her again, Cale!" cried the first voice; and again the whip descended,
                  and again the piercing cries: "O Lord!" "Oh, pray doan't!" "O Lord, hab mercy!"
                  "Oh! good massa, hab mercy!" mingled with the falling blows.</p>
               <p>"This way!" shouted Joe, pressing through the bushes, and bounding down the bank
                  toward the actors in this nineteenth-century tournament, wherein an armed knight
                  and a doughty squire were set against a weak, defenceless woman.</p>
               <p>Leaning against a pine at a few feet from the edge of the run, was a tall, bony
                  man of about fifty. His hair was coarse and black, and his skin the color of
                  tobacco juice. He wore the ordinary homespun of the district; and long, deep lines
                  about his mouth and under his eyes told the story of a dissipated life. His entire
                  appearance was anything but prepossessing.</p>
               <p>At the distance of three or four rods, and bound to the charred trunk of an old
                  tree, was a woman, several shades lighter than the man. Her feet were secured by
                  stout cords, and her arms were clasped around the blackened stump, and tied in
                  that position. Her back was bare to the loins, and, as she hung there, moaning
                  with agony, and shivering with cold, it seemed one mass of streaming gore.</p>
               <p>The brawny black, whom Boss Joe had so eccentrically addressed at the negro
                  meeting, years before, was in the act of whipping the woman; but, with one bound,
                  young Preston was on him. Wrenching the whip from his hand, he turned on his
                  master, crying out:</p>
               <p>"Untie her, you white-livered devil, or I'll plough your back as you've ploughed
                  hers!"</p>
               <p>"Don't interfere here, you d—d whelp!" shouted Dawsey, livid with rage, and
                  drawing his revolver.</p>
               <p>"I'll give you enough of that, you cowardly hound!" cried Joe, taking a small
                  Derringer from his pocket, and coolly advancing upon Dawsey.</p>
               <p>The latter levelled his pistol, but, before he could fire, by a dexterous movement
                  of my cane, I struck it from his hand. Drawing instantly a large knife, he rushed
                  upon me. The knife was descending—in another instant I should have "tasted
                  Southern steel," had not Frank caught his arm, wrenched the weapon from his grasp,
                  and, with the fury of an aroused tiger, sprung on him and borne him to the ground.
                  Planting his knee firmly on Dawsey's breast, and twisting his neckcloth tightly
                  about his throat, Frank yelled out:</p>
               <p>"Stand back. Let <emph>me</emph> deal with him!"</p>
               <p>"But you will kill him."</p>
               <p>"Well, he would have killed <emph>you!</emph>" he cried, tightening his hold on
                  Dawsey's throat.</p>
               <p>"Let him up, Frank. Let the devil have fair play," said Joe; "I'll give him a
                  chance at ten paces."</p>
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6528-00000111"/>
               <p>"Yes, let him up, my son; he is unarmed."</p>
               <p>Frank slowly and reluctantly released his hold, and the woman-whipper rose.
                  Looking at us for a moment—a mingled look of rage and defiance—he turned, without
                  speaking, and took some rapid strides up the bank.</p>
               <p>"Hold on, Colonel Dawsey!" cried Joe, elevating his Derringer; "take another step,
                  and I'll let daylight through you. You've just got to promise you won't whip this
                  woman, or take your chance at ten paces."</p>
               <p>[I afterward learned that Joe was deadly sure with the pistol.]</p>
               <p>Dawsey turned slowly round, and, in a sullen tone, asked:</p>
               <p>"Who are you, <emph>gentlemen,</emph> that interfere with my private affairs?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>My</emph> name, sir, is Kirke, of New York; and this young man is my
                  son."</p>
               <p>"Not Mr. Kirke, my factor?"</p>
               <p>"The same, sir."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Kirke, I'm sorry to say you're just now in d—d pore business."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>have</emph> been, sir. I've done yours for some years, and I'm heartily
                  ashamed of it. I'll try to mend in that particular, however."</p>
               <p>"Well, no more words, Colonel Dawsey," said Joe. "Here's a Derringer, if you'd
                  like a pop at me."</p>
               <p>"'Tain't an even chance," replied Dawsey; "you know it."</p>
               <p>"Take it, or promise not to whip the woman. I won't waste more time on such a
                  sneaking coward as you are."</p>
               <p>Dawsey hesitated, but finally, in a dogged way, made the required promise, and
                  took himself off.</p>
               <p>While this conversation was going on, Preston and the negro man had untied the
                  woman. Her back was bleeding profusely, and she was unable to stand. Lifting her
                  in their arms, the two conveyed her to the top of the bank, and then, making a bed
                  of their coats, laid her on the ground. We remained there until the negro returned
                  from the house with a turpentine wagon, and conveyed the woman "home." We then
                  returned to the plantation, and that afternoon, accompanied by Frank and Joe, I
                  resumed my journey.</p>
               <p>By way of episode, I will mention that the slave woman, after being confined to
                  her bed several weeks, recovered. Then Dawsey renewed his attack upon her, and,
                  from the effects of a second whipping, she died.</p>

               <head type="sub">DIFFICULTIES.</head>
               <p>RETURNING from the South a few weeks after the events narrated in the previous
                  chapter, Frank and I were met at Goldsboro by Preston and Selma, when the latter
                  accompanied us to the North, and once more resumed her place in David's
                  family.</p>
               <p>On the first of February following, Frank, then not quite twenty-one, was admitted
                  a partner in the house of Russell, Rollins &amp; Co., and, in the succeeding
                  summer, was sent to Europe on business of the firm. Shortly after his return, in
                  the following spring, he came on from Boston with a proposal from Cragin that I
                  should embark with them and young Preston in an extensive speculation. Deeming any
                  business in which Cragin was willing to engage worthy of careful consideration, I
                  listened to Frank's exposition of the plan of operations. He had originated the
                  project, and in it he displayed the comprehensive business mind and rare blending
                  of caution and boldness which characterized his father. As the result of this
                  transaction had an important influence on the future of some of the actors in my
                  story, I will detail its programme.</p>
               <p>It was during the Crimean war. The Russian ports were closed, and Great Britain
                  and the Continent of Europe were dependent entirely on the Southern States for
                  their supply of resinous articles. The rivers at the South were low, and it was
                  not supposed they would rise sufficiently to float produce to market before the
                  occurrence of the spring freshets, in the following April or May. Only forty
                  thousand barrels of common rosin were held in Wilmington—the largest naval store
                  port in the world; and it was estimated that not more than two hundred thousand
                  were on hand in the other ports of Savannah, Ga., Georgetown, S. C., Newbern and
                  Washington, N.C., and in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. Very little was for
                  sale in London, Liverpool, or Glasgow, the largest foreign markets for the
                  article; and Frank thought that a hundred and fifty thousand barrels could be
                  purchased. That quantity, taken at once out of market, would probably so much
                  enhance the value of the article, that the operation would realize a large profit
                  before the new crop came forward. The purchases were to be made simultaneously in
                  the various markets, and about two hundred thousand dollars were required to carry
                  through the transaction. One hundred thousand of this was to be furnished in equal
                  proportions by the parties interested; the other hundred thousand would be
                  realized by Joseph Preston's negotiating "long exchange" on Russell, Rollins &amp;
                  Co.</p>
               <p>I declined to embark in the speculation, but the others carried it out as laid
                  down in the programme; the only deviation being that, at Frank's suggestion, Mr.
                  Robert Preston was apprised of the intended movement, and allowed to purchase, on
                  his own account, as much produce as could be secured in Newbern. He bought about
                  seven thousand barrels, paid for them by drawing at ninety days on Russell,
                  Rollins &amp; Co., and<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC6528-00000113"/> held them for
                  sale at Newbern, agreeing to satisfy his drafts with the proceeds. These drafts
                  amounted to a trifle over eighty-two hundred dollars.</p>
               <p>About a month after this transaction was entered into, our firm received the
                  following letter from Preston:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"GENTLEMEN: An unfortunate difference with my son prevents my longer using him
                     as my indorser. I have not, as yet, been able to secure another; and, our banks
                     requiring two home names on time drafts, I have to beg you to honor a small
                     bill at one day's sight. I have drawn for one thousand dollars. Please
                     honor."</p>
               </q>
               <p>To this I at once replied:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"DEAR SIR: We have advice of your draft for one thousand dollars. To protect
                     your credit, we shall pay it; but we beg you will draw no more, till you
                     forward bills of lading.</p>
                  <p>"You are now overdrawn some five thousand dollars, which, by the maturing of
                     your drafts, has become a <emph>cash</emph> advance. The death of our senior,
                     Mr. Randall, and the consequent withdrawal of his capital, has left us with an
                     extended business and limited means. Money, also, is very tight, and we
                     therefore earnestly beg you to put us in funds at the earliest possible
                     moment."</p>
               </q>
               <p>No reply was received to this letter; but, about ten days after its transmission,
                  Preston himself walked into my private office. His clothes were travel stained,
                  and he appeared haggard and careworn. I had never seen him look so miserably.</p>
               <p>He met me cordially, and soon referred to the state of his affairs. His wife, the
                  winter before, had agreed to reside permanently at Newbern, and content herself
                  with an allowance of three thousand dollars annually; but at the close of the year
                  he found that she had contracted debts to the extent of several thousand more. He
                  was pressed for these debts; his interest was in arrears, and he could raise no
                  money for lack of another indorser. Ruin stared him in the face, unless I again
                  put my shoulder to the wheel, and pried him out of the mire. The turpentine
                  business was not paying as well as formerly, but the new plantation was encumbered
                  with only the original mortgage—less than six thousand dollars—and was then worth,
                  owing to an advance in the value of land, fully twenty thousand. He would secure
                  me by a mortgage on that property, but I <emph>must</emph> allow the present
                  indebtedness to stand, and let him increase it four or five thousand dollars. That
                  amount would extricate him from present difficulties; and, to avoid future
                  embarrassments, he would take measures for a legal separation from his wife.</p>
               <p>I heard him through, and then said:</p>
               <p>"I cannot help you, my friend. I am very sorry; but my own affairs are in a most
                  critical state. I owe over a hundred thousand dollars, maturing within twenty
                  days, and my present available resources are not more than fifty thousand. I have
                  three hundred thousand worth of produce on hand, but the market is so depressed
                  that I cannot realize a dollar upon it. The banks have shut down, and money is two
                  per cent. a month in the street. What you owe us would aid me wonderfully; but I
                  can rub through without it. That much I can bear, but not a dollar more."</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6528-00000114"/>
               <p>He walked the room for a time, and was silent; then, turning to me, he said—each
                  separate word seeming a groan:</p>
               <p>"I have cursed every one I ever loved, and now I am bringing trouble—perhaps
                  disaster—upon <emph>you,</emph> the only real friend I have left."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! my good fellow, don't talk in that way. What you owe us is only a drop in
                  the bucket. We have made twice that amount out of you; so give yourself no
                  uneasiness, if you <emph>never</emph> pay it."</p>
               <p>"But I must pay it—I <emph>shall</emph> pay it;" and, continuing to pace the room
                  silently for a few moments, he added, giving me his hand: "Good-by; I'm going back
                  to-night."</p>
               <p>"Back to-night!—without seeing Selly, or my wife? You are mad!"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>must</emph> go."</p>
               <p>"You must <emph>not</emph> go. You are letting affairs trouble you too much. Come,
                  go home with me, and see Kate. A few words from her will make a new man of
                  you."</p>
               <p>"No, no; I must go back at once. I must raise this money somehow."</p>
               <p>"Send money to the dogs! Come with me, and have a good night's rest. You'll think
                  better of this in the morning. And now it occurs to me that Kate has about seven
                  thousand belonging to Frank. He means to settle it on Selly when they are married,
                  and she might as well have it first as last. Perhaps you can get it now."</p>
               <p>"But I might be robbing my own child."</p>
               <p>"You can give the farm as security; it's worth twice the amount."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll stay. Let us see your wife at once."</p>
               <p>While we were seated in the parlor, after supper, I broached the subject of
                  Preston's wants to Kate. She heard me through attentively, and then quietly
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Frank is of age—he can do as he pleases; but <emph>I</emph> would not advise him
                  to make the loan. I once heard my father scout at the idea of taking security on
                  property a thousand miles away. I would not wound Mr. Preston's feelings, but—his
                  wife's extravagance has led him into this difficulty, and her property should
                  extricate him from it. Her town house, horses, and carriages should be sold. She
                  ought to be made to feel some of the mortification she has brought upon him."</p>
               <p>Preston's face brightened; a new idea seemed to strike him. "You are right. I will
                  sell everything." His face clouded again, as he continued: "But I cannot realize
                  soon enough. Your husband needs money at once."</p>
               <p>"Never mind me; I can take care of myself. But what is this trouble with Joe? Tell
                  me, I will arrange it. Everything can go on smoothly again."</p>
               <p>"It cannot be arranged. There can be no reconciliation between us."</p>
               <p>"What prevents? Who is at fault—you, or he?"</p>
               <p>"I am. He will never forgive me!"</p>
               <p>"Forgive you! I can't imagine what you have done, that admits of no
                  forgiveness."</p>
               <p>He rose, and walked the room for a while in gloomy silence, then said:</p>
               <p>"I will tell you. It is right you should know. You <emph>both</emph> should know
                  the sort of man you have esteemed and be-friended for so many years;" and,
                  resuming his seat, he related the following occurrences:</p>
               <pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6528-00000115"/>
               <p>"Everything went on as usual at the plantation, till some months after Rosey's
                  marriage to Ally. Then a child was born to them. It was white. Rosey refused to
                  reveal its father, but it was evidently not her husband. Ally, being a proud,
                  high-spirited fellow, took the thing terribly to heart. He refused to live with
                  his wife, or even to see her. I tried to reconcile them, but without success. Old
                  Dinah, who had previously doted on Rosey, turned about, and began to beat and
                  abuse her cruelly. To keep the child out of the old woman's way, I took her into
                  the house, and she remained there till about two months ago. Then, one day,
                  Larkin, the trader, of whom you bought Phylly and the children, came to me,
                  wanting a woman house-servant. I was pressed for money, and I offered him—a thing
                  I never did before—two or three of my family slaves. They did not suit, but he
                  said Rosey would, and proposed to buy her and the child. I refused. He offered me
                  fifteen hundred dollars for them, but I still refused. Then he told me that he had
                  spoken to the girl, and she wished him to buy her. I doubted it, and said so; but
                  he called Rosey to us, and she confirmed it, and, in an excited way, told me she
                  would run away, or drown herself, if I did not sell her. She said she could live
                  no longer on the same plantation with Ally. I told her I would send Ally away; but
                  she replied: 'No; I am tired of this place. I have suffered so much here, I want
                  to get away. I <emph>shall</emph> go; whether alive or dead, is for
                     <emph>you</emph> to say.' I saw she was in earnest; I was hard pressed for
                  money; Larkin promised to get her a kind master, and—I sold her."</p>
               <p>"Sold her! My God! Preston, she was your own child!"</p>
               <p>"I know it," he replied, burying his face in his hands. "The curse of GOD was on
                  it; it has been on me for years." After a few moments, he added: "But hear the
                  rest, and <emph>you</emph> will curse me too."</p>
               <p>Overcome with emotion, he groaned audibly. I said nothing, and a pause of some
                  minutes ensued. Then, in a choked, broken voice, he continued:</p>
               <p>"The rosin transaction had been gone into. I had used up what blank indorsements I
                  had. Needing more, and wanting to consult with Joe about selling the rosin, I went
                  to Mobile. It was five weeks ago. I arrived there about dark, and put up at the
                  Battle House. Joe had boarded there. I was told he had left, and gone to
                  housekeeping. A negro conducted me to a small house in the outskirts of the town.
                  He said Joe lived there. Wishing to surprise him, I went in without knocking. The
                  house had two parlors, separated by folding doors. In the back one a young woman
                  was clearing away the tea things; in the front one, Joe was seated by the fire,
                  with a young child on his knee. I put my hand on his shoulder, and said: 'Joe,
                  whose child have you here?' He looked up, and laughingly said: 'Why, father, you
                  ought to know; you've seen it before!' I looked closely at it—it was Rosey's! I
                  said so. 'Yes, father,' he replied; 'and there's Rosey herself. Larkin promised
                  she should have a kind master, and—he kept his word.' The truth flashed upon
                  me—the child was his! My only son had seduced his <emph>own sister!</emph> I
                  staggered back in horror. I told him who Rosey was, and then"—no words can express
                  the intense agony depicted on his face as he said this—"then he cursed me! O my
                  God! HE CURSED ME!"</p>
               <p>I pitied him. I could but pity him; and I said:</p>
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6528-00000116"/>
               <p>"Do not be so cast down, my friend. I once heard you say: 'The Lord is good. His
                  mercy is everlasting!'"</p>
               <p>"But He cannot have mercy on some!" he cried. "<emph>My</emph> sins have been too
                  great; they cannot be blotted out. I embittered the life of my wife; I have driven
                  my daughter from her home; sold my own child; made my generous, noble-hearted boy
                  do a horrible crime—a crime that will haunt him forever. Oh! the curse of God is
                  on me. My misery is greater than I can bear."</p>
               <p>"No, my friend; God curses none of his creatures. You have reaped what you have
                  sown, that is all; but you have suffered enough. Better things, believe me, are in
                  store for you."</p>
               <p>"No, no; everything is gone—wife, children, all! I am alone—the past, nothing but
                  remorse; the future, ruin and dishonor!"</p>
               <p>"But Selly is left you. <emph>She</emph> will always love you."</p>
               <p>"No, no! Even Selly would curse me, if she knew <emph>all!</emph>"</p>
               <p>No one spoke for a full half hour, and he continued pacing up and down the room.
                  When, at last, he seated himself, more composed, I asked:</p>
               <p>"What became of Rosey and the child?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know. I was shut in my room for several days. When I got out, I was told
                  Joe had freed her, and she had disappeared, no one knew whither. I tried every
                  means to trace her, but could not. At the end of a week, I went home, what you see
                  me—a broken-hearted man."</p>
               <p>The next morning, despite our urgent entreaties, he returned to the South.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The twenty days were expiring. By hard struggling I had met my liabilities, but
                  the last day—the crisis—was approaching. Thirty thousand dollars of our
                  acceptances had accumulated together, and were maturing on that day. When I went
                  home, on the preceding night, we had only nineteen thousand in bank. I had
                  exhausted all our receivables. Where the eleven thousand was to come from, I did
                  not know. Only one resource seemed left me—the hypothecation of produce; and a
                  resort to that, at that time, before warehouse receipts became legitimate
                  securities, would be ruinous to our credit. My position was a terrible one. No one
                  not a merchant can appreciate or realize it. With thousands upon thousands of
                  assets, the accumulations of years, my standing among merchants, and, what I
                  valued more than all, my untarnished credit, were in jeopardy for the want of a
                  paltry sum.</p>
               <p>I went home that night with a heavy heart; but Kate's hopeful words encouraged me.
                  With her and the children left to me, I need not care for the rest; all might go,
                  and I could commence again at the bottom of the hill. The next morning I walked
                  down town with a firm spirit, ready to meet disaster like a man. The letters by
                  the early mail were on my desk. I opened them one after another, hurriedly,
                  eagerly. There were no remittances! I had expected at least five thousand dollars.
                  For a moment my courage failed me. I rose, and paced the room, and thoughts like
                  these passed through my mind: "The last alternative has come. Pride must give way
                  to duty. I must hypothecate produce, and protect my correspondents. I must
                  sacrifice myself, to save my friends!</p>
               <p>"But here are two letters I have thrown aside. They<pb n="232-233"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000117"/> are addressed to me personally. Mere letters of
                  friendship! What is friendship, at a time like this?—friendship without money!
                  Pshaw! I wouldn't give a fig for all the friends in the world!"</p>
               <p>Mechanically I opened one of them. An enclosure dropped from it to the floor.
                  Without pausing to pick it up, I read:</p>
               <q>

               </q>
               <p>"SAVED! saved by my wife and child!" I leaned my head on my desk. When I rose,
                  there were tears upon it.</p>
               <p>It wanted some minutes of ten, but I was nervously impatient to blot out those
                  terrible acceptances. I should then be safe; I should then breathe freely. As I
                  passed out of my private office, I opened the other letter. It was from Preston.
                  Pausing a moment, I read it:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"MY VERY DEAR FRIEND: I enclose you sight check of Branch Bank of Cape Fear on
                     Bank of Republic, for $10,820. Apply what is needed to pay my account; the rest
                     hold subject to my drafts.</p>
                  <p>"I have sold my town house, furniture, horses, &amp; c., and the proceeds will
                     pay my home debts. I shall therefore not need to draw the balance for, say,
                     sixty days. God bless you!"</p>
               </q>
               <p>"Well, the age of miracles is <emph>not</emph> passed! How <emph>did</emph> he
                  raise the money?"</p>
               <p>Stepping back into the private office, I called my partner:</p>
               <p>"Draw checks for all the acceptances due to-day; get them certified, and take up
                  the bills at once. Don't let the grass grow under your feet. I shall be away the
                  rest of the day, and I want to see them before I go. Here is a draft from Preston;
                  it will make our account good."</p>
               <p>He looked at it, and, laughing, said:</p>
               <p>"Yes, and leave about fifty dollars in bank."</p>
               <p>"Well, never mind; we are out of the woods."</p>
               <p>When he had gone, I sat down, and wrote the following letter:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"MY DEAR FRANK: I return Cragin's check, with many thanks. I have not sold your
                     stock. My legitimate resources have carried me through.</p>
                  <p>"I need not say, my boy, that I feel what you would have done for me. Words are
                     not needed between <emph>us.</emph>
                  </p>
                  <p>"Tell Cragin that I consider him a trump—the very ace of hearts.</p>
                  <p>"Your mother and I will see you in a few days."</p>
               </q>
               <p>In half an hour, with the two letters in my pocket, I was on my way home. Handing
                  them to Kate, I took her in my arms; and, as I brushed the still bright, golden
                  hair from her broad forehead, I felt I was the richest man living.</p>

               <head type="sub">A SUDDEN DISSOLUTION.</head>
               <p>WITHIN the same week I went to Boston. I arrived just after dark; but, as it was
                  again "steamer night," I drove directly to the office of Russell, Rollins &amp;
                  Co.</p>
               <p>David occupied his accustomed stand at the old desk, and Frank was seated near
                  him. After the usual greetings were over, I said to Frank:</p>
               <p>"Come! your mother is in the carriage at the door, and wants you to spend the
                  evening with her."</p>
               <p>"I can't. I'm very sorry;" and he added, in a lower tone: "Selly has just heard of
                  her father's death, and goes home to-morrow. I must spend the evening with
                  her."</p>
               <p>"Preston dead! How was it?"</p>
               <p>"He was thrown from a horse, and died the same day. She got the telegram
                  yesterday. I'll go down and see mother for a moment."</p>
               <p>"Well, do; and we'll go out to Cambridge with you. The poor girl must feel
                  badly."</p>
               <p>"Yes; she takes it very hard."</p>
               <p>As he went out, I rapped at the door of the inner office. Hallet and Cragin were
                  both there, and the latter greeted me cordially. The other was very polite and
                  very stiff, as usual.</p>
               <p>After a few general remarks were exchanged, I said.</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Hallet, how does Frank get on?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! very well. Knows a little too much, like most young men of his age; but he
                  does very well."</p>
               <p>"'Very well!' Mr. Hallet, d—d if he don't; he's the smartest boy living. Made a
                  clean forty thousand on the rosin speculation. Forced it on Hallet against his
                  better judgment—ha! ha!" and Cragin laughed till he showed all that were left of
                  his tobacco-stained teeth.</p>
               <p>"Not exactly <emph>clear,</emph> Mr. Cragin," said Hallet, a little
                  sarcastically.</p>
               <p>"I'm <emph>sure</emph> of it, Mr. Hallet," replied Cragin, in his quick, impulsive
                  way; "but we might as well understand each other about this first as last. If we
                  lose by Preston, the loss is not charged to Frank; it must go to the rosin
                  operation. You took your part of the profits, you must bear your share of the
                  losses."</p>
               <p>"Very well," replied Hallet, impatiently; "we'll discuss that some other
                  time."</p>
               <p>A short rap came at the office door, and Frank entered, hat in hand.</p>
               <p>"Mother insists on going now. Are you ready, sir?" he said, addressing me.</p>
               <p>Before I could reply, Hallet sharply asked:</p>
               <p>"Have you written your letters for the steamer?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
               <p>"What have you said to Maclean, Maris &amp; Co. about the gum copal?"</p>
               <p>"I will show you, sir;" and, going into the other room, he soon returned with an
                  open letter, still wet from the copying<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6528-00000119"/>
                  press. Hallet took it, read it over slowly and carefully, and, handing it back,
                  said, in the slightly pompous tone natural to him:</p>
               <p>"That will do; you can go."</p>
               <p>I was rising to bid them "good evening," when Hallet said to me:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Kirke, I dislike to trespass on your time; but I wish to confer with you a
                  few moments on a private matter."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, sir;" and I added, turning to Cragin: "Kate is going out with Frank.
                  You can take a seat with her, if you like."</p>
               <p>"Thank you; I think I will—and there'll be room enough for David, I guess."</p>
               <p>"I want David here," said Hallet, curtly.</p>
               <p>"Oh! very well. You'll come soon, Ned?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; before the tea cakes are cold."</p>
               <p>When Cragin had gone, Hallet, opening the door, called:</p>
               <p>"David!"</p>
               <p>The bookkeeper entered, and took a seat beside me.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Kirke," said Hallet, when the other was seated, "I want to talk with you and
                  David about Frank. He has entangled himself with that Southern girl, and, I hear,
                  means to marry her. I strongly object to it. I've not a particle of influence with
                  him, and <emph>you</emph> must prevent it."</p>
               <p>"Why should I prevent it?" I asked, rather sharply. "What is there against the
                  young woman?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing against her character, but she'd not be a fit wife for Frank. These
                  Southern women are educated with wrong ideas; they make poor wives for poor men.
                  He must marry a rich girl, or one brought up with New England habits. This one
                  would bring him nothing, and spend all he made."</p>
               <p>"But she is an only daughter, and her father is said to be rich."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! that is bosh! Preston always lived high, and I'll guarantee his estate is
                  bankrupt. I'm sorry for it, for he owes us."</p>
               <p>"Is that so! Largely?"</p>
               <p>"No, not largely. How much is he overdrawn, David?"</p>
               <p>"Eighty-two hundred and odd."</p>
               <p>"I'm surprised at that," I said. "The old house did not allow such things."</p>
               <p>"Neither do we; 'twas Cragin's work. He thought 'twould annoy Frank if the drafts
                  went back, and"—he hesitated a moment—"he insisted upon it. 'Twill be a total
                  loss. Preston acted very dishonorably about it."</p>
               <p>"Dishonorably! How so, Mr. Hallet?" I asked, in a tone of decided displeasure.</p>
               <p>"Well, he drew on us to pay for some rosin bought on speculation. He agreed to
                  ship it to us, or, if he sold it there, to remit enough to cover the drafts. He
                  sold it some weeks ago, and diverted the proceeds."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible!" I exclaimed.</p>
               <p>It was true. To relieve me, Preston—an honest man, if one ever existed—had ruined
                  his good name; done an act which, had he lived, would have branded him to his
                  latest day.</p>
               <p>I said no more, and Hallet remarked:</p>
               <p>"I would be glad to have you break up that connection, Mr. Kirke."</p>
               <p>"I cannot, Mr. Hallet. I am opposed to interfering in such matters. I taught Frank
                  to think for himself."</p>
               <pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6528-00000120"/>
               <p>"You taught him to think too much for himself. He is self-willed and headstrong to
                  a fault."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you might have trained him better, if you had tried," I replied, with a
                  slight sneer.</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Mr. Kirke; I mean no reflection on your management of him. I only feel
                  that this is a most important step, and he ought to be advised. He should marry
                  rich, for he has nothing, and cannot rely upon me."</p>
               <p>"He does not rely upon you; but he is a partner now, and his income ought to
                  support a wife."</p>
               <p>"His income is uncertain; he may not remain long in the concern," replied Hallet,
                  coolly.</p>
               <p>David started. His face reddened to the roots of his hair, and he asked, in a
                  sententious way:</p>
               <p>"Who told thee that, John?"</p>
               <p>"No one," replied that gentleman, seemingly surprised at the abrupt question; "I
                  am deliberating on it myself. He is sowing dissension between Cragin and me. The
                  lowest boy in the office—even you, David, pay more heed to him than to
                     <emph>me.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"That may be your own fault," I said, a little sarcastically. "If you should treat
                  him as Cragin and David do, you would have nothing to complain of."</p>
               <p>"I treat him well, sir; but I make him <emph>know his place.</emph>" The last
                  words were emphasized in a hard, wicked tone.</p>
               <p>Certain old recollections had been rushing across my mind during the latter part
                  of this conversation, and this last remark brought me to my feet, as I said:</p>
               <p>"You treat him like a dog, sir! I have seen it. If he were not your son, he should
                  not stay with you another day!"</p>
               <p>In my excitement I crossed the room, and stood directly before him. His face
                  flushed, and his eye quailed before my steady gaze, but he said nothing.</p>
               <p>David remarked, in a mild tone: "Edmund, that ain't the right spirit, it
                  ain't."</p>
               <p>"You don't know the whole, David. If you did, even <emph>you</emph> would say he
                  is the basest wretch living."</p>
               <p>Hallet pressed his teeth together; his eyes flashed fire, and he seemed about to
                  spring upon me. Mastering his passion, he rose, after a moment, and extended his
                  hand, saying:</p>
               <p>"Come, Mr. Kirke, this is not the talk of old friends! Let us shake hands, and
                  forget it."</p>
               <p>"Never, sir! I took your hand for the last time when I left this counting room,
                  twenty years ago. I never touch it again! I shall tell that boy,
                     <emph>to-night,</emph> that you are his father."</p>
               <p>"You will not do so imprudent a thing? I will do anything for him—anything you
                  require. I promise you, on my honor;" and the stately head of the great house of
                  Russell, Rollins &amp; Co. sank into a chair, and bent down, like a convicted
                  criminal.</p>
               <p>"I cannot trust you," I said, pacing the room.</p>
               <p>"Thee can, Edmund; he means it. He is sorry for the wrong he's done," said the old
                  bookkeeper, in the mild, winning tone which made me so love him in my boyhood.</p>
               <p>"Well, let him <emph>prove</emph> that he means it; let him tell you all; let him
                  tell you how much he has to repent of!"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>have</emph> told him all. I told him years ago."</p>
               <p>"Did you tell him how you cast off the poor girl? how for years she vainly plead
                  for a paltry pittance to keep her child from starving, and herself from sin? Did
                  you tell him how<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6528-00000121"/> you drove her from you
                  with curses, when she prayed to be saved from the pit of infamy into which you had
                  plunged her? Did you tell him"—and he writhed on his seat in such agony as only
                  the guilty can feel—"how, at last, after all those wretched years, she died of
                  starvation and disease, with all that mountain of sin on her soul, and all of it
                  heaped on her by YOU!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no; I did not—I could not tell him that! I did not know I had done
                     <emph>that!</emph>" groaned the stately gentleman.</p>
               <p>"You lie, John Hallet! you know you lie! and may God deal with you as you dealt
                  with her;" and I took up my hat, and laid my hand on the door.</p>
               <p>"Stop! stop, Edmund! Don't go with those words. Thee would not have God deal with
                  thee, as thee has dealt with others!" said David, in the same mild tone as
                  before.</p>
               <p>"True, David; I should not wish him harm; but I loathe and detest the hypocritical
                  villain. Frank shall leave him to-night, and forever!"</p>
               <p>Hallet looked up. His face was pale as marble, and his hands clenched tightly the
                  arms of his chair. "Don't go, Mr. Kirke," he cried; "stay one moment. Can't this
                  be arranged?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, sir. Sign a dissolution at once—<emph>here</emph>—NOW; and give Frank your
                  check for twenty thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"No, no! You don't mean that! It is too much—you can't ask <emph>that!</emph>"
                  gasped the great merchant.</p>
               <p>"Too much for the son of a man worth a million? Too much for starving his mother,
                  and turning him adrift at seven years old? It is not enough! He must have
                     <emph>thirty</emph> thousand!"</p>
               <p>"You are mad, Mr. Kirke!" and he looked at me with a pleading face. "I cannot pay
                  that amount down. It is impossible."</p>
               <p>"David, how much has he in bank on private account?"</p>
               <p>Hallet cast a beseeching glance at his bookkeeper; but, without moving a muscle,
                  the old man replied:</p>
               <p>"Fifty-three thousand."</p>
               <p>"I knew you lied, Hallet. It is natural to you."</p>
               <p>"But I can't let Frank go without Mr. Cragin's consent."</p>
               <p>"I will arrange with Cragin. Sign the check, and draw the paper at once, or I
                  go."</p>
               <p>"But give me time to think—see me to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"I shall never exchange a word with you after to-night. You can have ten
                  minutes—not a second more;" and I took out my watch to count the time.</p>
               <p>He rested his head on his hand for a moment, and then, turning to me, said:</p>
               <p>"You promise that this interview, and all that has passed, shall never be
                  mentioned by you?"</p>
               <p>"That depends on yourself—never without cause."</p>
               <p>"David, please write the check," said the senior partner, proceeding himself to
                  draw up the agreement. In a few minutes he handed it to me. It was short, and
                  merely recited that the copartnership which had theretofore existed between John
                  Hallet, Augustus Cragin, and Henry F. Mandell, under the name and style of
                  Russell, Rollins &amp; Co., was on that day dissolved by mutual consent; said
                  Mandell withdrawing, and assigning the control of all the assets of said firm to
                  said Hallet and Cragin, and releasing to said Hallet any portion of its capital
                  and profits to which he might be entitled.</p>
               <pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6528-00000122"/>
               <p>I read the document, and quietly handed it back.</p>
               <p>"That will not do, Mr. Hallet. Thirty thousand dollars settles with
                     <emph>you,</emph> his father. I have not, and <emph>shall</emph> not make any
                  settlement with the firm. David must pay Frank what is due him—no more, no
                  less."</p>
               <p>"But," began Mr. Hallet.</p>
               <p>"I have nothing more to say on the subject, sir."</p>
               <p>He drew a long sigh. The parting with an only son, and with thirty thousand
                  dollars, at one and the same time, affected him deeply. He might have borne the
                  loss of the son; but the loss of the money rent his distorted soul into fragments.
                  However, he rewrote the paper, and passed it to me. It was all right; and when he
                  had signed, and David had witnessed it, I placed it in my pocket book. Then, with
                  a trembling hand, he handed me the check. It was drawn to my order; and I
                  remarked, as I took it:</p>
               <p>"This is not what I require, sir. I want your check, indorsed by David."</p>
               <p>"This is most unaccountable, Mr. Kirke. Do you question my check for thirty
                  thousand dollars?" he asked, his face flushing with anger.</p>
               <p>"Oh! no, sir, not at all; but you might stop its payment. With David's
                  indorsement, you would not <emph>dare</emph> to do it."</p>
               <p>"I will indorse it," said David; and he quietly proceeded to write another.</p>
               <p>That hard, soulless man had a wife and children; but that old bookkeeper was the
                  only living thing in all the wide world that he either loved or trusted!</p>
               <p>I placed the check with the other paper, and, with David, soon passed down the old
                  stairway.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>I found Selma plunged in the deepest grief. The telegram which informed her of
                  Preston's death was dated three days before (it had been sent to Goldsboro for
                  transmission, the telegraph lines not then running to Newbern), and she could not
                  possibly reach the plantation until after her father's burial; but she insisted on
                  going at once. She would have his body exhumed; she must take a last look at that
                  face which had never beamed on her but in love!</p>
               <p>Frank proposed to escort her, but she knew he could not well be spared from
                  business at that season; and, with a bravery and self-reliance not common to her
                  years and her sex, she determined to go alone.</p>
               <p>Shortly after my arrival at the house, she retired to her room with Kate, to make
                  the final arrangements for the journey; and I seated myself with David, Cragin,
                  and Frank, in the little back parlor, which the gray-haired old Quaker and his
                  son-in-law had converted into a smoking room.</p>
               <p>As Cragin was lighting his cigar, I said to him:</p>
               <p>"Have you heard the news?"</p>
               <p>"What news?"</p>
               <p>"The dissolution of Russell, Rollins &amp; Co."</p>
               <p>"No; there's nothing so good stirring. But you'll hear it some two years
                  hence."</p>
               <p>"Read that;" and I handed him the paper which Hallet had signed.</p>
               <p>"What is it, father?" asked Frank, his face alive with interest.</p>
               <p>"Cragin will show it to you, if it ever gets through his hair. I reckon he's
                  learning to read."</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC6528-00000123"/>
               <p>"Well, I believe I <emph>can't</emph> read. What the deuce does it mean?"</p>
               <p>"Just what it says—Frank is free."</p>
               <p>The young man glanced over the paper. His face expressed surprise, but he said
                  nothing.</p>
               <p>"Then you've heard how things have been going on?" asked Cragin.</p>
               <p>"No, not a word. I've <emph>seen</emph> that Hallet was abusing the boy
                  shamefully. I came on, wanting an excuse to break the copartnership."</p>
               <p>"Do you know you've done me the greatest service in the world? I told Hallet, the
                  other day, that we couldn't pull together much longer. He refused to let me off
                  till our term is up; but I've got him now;" and he laughed in boyish glee.</p>
               <p>"Of course, the paper releases you as well as Frank. It's a general
                  dissolution."</p>
               <p>"Of course it is. How did you manage to get it? Hallet must have been crazy. He
                  wasn't <emph>John Hallet,</emph> that's certain!"</p>
               <p>"The <emph>genuine</emph> John, but a <emph>little</emph> excited."</p>
               <p>"He must have been. But I'm rid of him, thank the Lord! Come, what do you say to
                  Frank's going in with me? I'll pack him off to Europe at once—he can secure most
                  of the old business."</p>
               <p>"<emph>He</emph> must decide about that. He can come with me, if he likes. He'll
                  not go a begging, that's certain. He'll have thirty thousand to start with."</p>
               <p>"Thirty thousand!" exclaimed Frank. "No, father, you can't do that; you need every
                  dollar you've got."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I do, and more too. But the money is yours, not mine. You shall have it
                  to-morrow."</p>
               <p>"Mine! Where did it come from?"</p>
               <p>"From a relative of yours. But he's modest; he don't want to be known."</p>
               <p>"But I <emph>ought</emph> to know. I thought I had no relatives."</p>
               <p>"Well, you haven't—only this one, and he's rich as mud. He gave you the five
                  thousand; but this is a last instalment—you won't get another red cent."</p>
               <p>"I don't feel exactly like taking money in that way."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, my boy! I tell you it's yours—rightfully and honestly. You ought to have
                  more; but he's closefisted, and you must be content with this."</p>
               <p>"Well, Frank," said Cragin, "what do you say to hitching horses with me? I'll give
                  you two fifths, and put a hundred against your thirty."</p>
               <p>"What shall I do?" said Frank to me.</p>
               <p>"You'd better accept. It's more than I can allow you."</p>
               <p>"Then it's a trade?" asked Cragin.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Frank.</p>
               <p>"Well, old gentleman, what do <emph>you</emph> say—will you move the old stool?"
                  said Cragin, addressing David.</p>
               <p>"Yes; I like Frank too well to stay with even his father."</p>
               <p>In the gleeful mood which had taken possession of the old man, the words slipped
                  from his tongue before he was aware of it. He would have recalled them on the
                  instant, but it was too late. Cragin caught them, and exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"His father! Well, that explains some riddles. D—d if I won't call the new firm
                  Hallet, Cragin &amp; Co. I've got him all around—ha! ha!"</p>
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6528-00000124"/>
               <p>Frank seemed thunderstruck. Soon he plied me with questions.</p>
               <p>"I can say nothing; I gave my word I would not. David has betrayed it; let him
                  explain, if he pleases."</p>
               <p>The old bookkeeper then told the young man his history, revealing everything but
                  the degradation of his poor mother. Frank walked the room, struggling with
                  contending emotions. When David concluded, he put his hand in mine, and spoke a
                  few low words. His voice sounded like his mother's. It was again <emph>her</emph>
                  blessing that I heard.</p>

               <p>Two weeks afterward, the old sign came down from the old warehouse—came down,
                  after hanging there three quarters of a century, and in its place went up a black
                  board, on which. emblazoned in glaring gilt letters, were the two words, <q>

               <p>KATE heard frequently from Selma within the first two months after her departure,
                  but then her letters suddenly ceased. Her last one expressed the intention of
                  returning to the North during the following week. We looked for her, but she did
                  not come. Week after week went by, and still she did not come. Kate wrote,
                  inquiring when we might expect her, but received no reply. She wrote again and
                  again, and still no answer came. "Something has happened to her. <emph>Do</emph>
                  write Mrs. Preston," said Kate. I wrote her. She either did not deign to reply, or
                  she did not receive the letter.</p>
               <p>None of Selma's friends had heard from her for more than three months, and we were
                  in a state of painful anxiety and uncertainty, when, one morning, among my
                  letters, I found one addressed to my wife, in Selma's handwriting. Her previous
                  letters had been mailed at Trenton, but this was postmarked "Newbern." I sent it
                  at once to my house. About an hour afterward I was surprised by Kate's appearance
                  in the office. Her face was pale, her manner hurried and excited. She held a small

               <p>She handed me the letter. "Read that."</p>

                           <p>"MY DEAREST FRIEND: I know <emph>you</emph> have not forsaken me, but
                              I have written you, oh! so many times. To-day, Ally has told me that
                              perhaps our letters are intercepted at the Trenton post office. It
                              must be so. He takes this to Newbern. Is he not kind? He has been my
                              faithful friend through all. Though ordered away from the plantation,
                              he refused to go, and stood by me through the worst. He, whom my own
                              sister so cruelly wronged, has done everything for me! Whatever may
                              become of me, I shall ever bless him.</p>
                           <p>"I have not heard from or seen any of my friends. Even my brother has
                              not answered my letters; but he must be here on the 17th, at the sale.
                              That is now my only hope. I shall then be freed from this misery—worse
                              than death. God bless you!</p>

               <p>It was then the morning of the twelfth. Making all the connections, and there
                  being no delay of the trains, I should reach the plantation early on the
                  seventeenth.</p>
               <p>At twelve o'clock I was on the way. Steam was too slow for my impatience. I would
                  have harnessed the lightning. At last—it was sundown of the sixteenth—the stage
                  drove into Newbern.</p>
               <p>With my carpet bag in my hand, I rushed into the hotel. Four or five loungers were
                  in the office, and the lazy bartender was mixing drinks behind the counter.</p>
               <p>"Sir, I want a horse, or a horse and buggy, at once."</p>
               <p>"A horse? Ye're in a hurry, hain't ye?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Wall, I reckon ye'll hev ter git over it. Thar hain't a durned critter in th'

               <p>"I'm in no mood for jesting, sir. I want a horse <emph>at once.</emph> I will
                  deposit twice his value."</p>
               <p>"Ye couldn't git nary critter, stranger, ef ye wus made uv gold. They're all
                  off—off ter Squire Preston's sale."</p>
               <p>"The sale! Has it begun?"</p>
               <p>"I reckon! Ben a gwine fur two days."</p>
               <p>My heart sank within me. I was too late!</p>
               <p>"Are all the negroes sold?"</p>
               <p>"No; them comes on ter morrer. He's got a likely gang."</p>
               <p>I breathed more freely. At this moment a well-dressed gentleman, followed by a
                  good-looking yellow man, entered the room. He wore spurs, and was covered with
                  dust. Approaching the counter, he said:</p>
               <p>"Here, you lousy devil—a drink for me and my boy. I'm dryer than a parson—Old
                  Bourbon."</p>
               <pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC6528-00000126"/>
               <p>As the bartender poured out the liquor, the newcomer's eye fell upon me. His face
                  seemed familiar, but I could not recall it. Scanning me for a moment, he held out
                  his hand in a free, cordial manner, saying:</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mr. Kirke, is this you? You don't remember me? my name is Gaston."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gaston, I'm glad to see you," I replied, returning his salutation.</p>
               <p>"Have a drink, sir?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you." I emptied the glass. I was jaded, and had eaten nothing since
                  morning. "I'm in pursuit of a horse under difficulties, Mr. Gaston. Perhaps you
                  can tell me where to get one. I must be at Preston's to-night."</p>
               <p>"They're scarcer than hen's teeth round here, just now, I reckon. But hold on; I
                  go there in the morning. I'll borrow a buggy, and you can ride up with me."</p>
               <p>"No, I must be there to-night. How far is it?"</p>
               <p>"Twenty miles."</p>
               <p>"Well, I'll walk. Landlord, give me supper at once."</p>
               <p>"<emph>Walk</emph> there! My dear sir, we don't abuse strangers in 'these
                  diggin's.' The road is sandier than an Arab desert. You'd never get there afoot.
                  Tom," he added, calling to his man, "give Buster some oats; rub him down, and have
                  him here in half an hour. Vanish, now, like greased lightning." Then, turning to
                  me, he continued: "You can have <emph>my</emph> horse. He's a spirited fellow, and
                  you'll need to keep an eye on him; but he'll get you there in two hours."</p>
               <p>"But how will <emph>you</emph> get on?"</p>
               <p>"I'll take my boy's, and leave the darky here."</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gaston, I cannot tell you the service you're doing me."</p>
               <p>"Don't speak of it, my dear sir. A stranger can have anything of mine but my wife.
                  I keep <emph>her</emph> as private property;" and he laughed pleasantly.</p>
               <p>He went with me into the supper room, and there told me that the sale of Preston's
                  plantation, furniture, live stock, farm tools, &amp; c., had occupied the two
                  previous days; and that the negroes were to be put on the block at nine o'clock
                  the next morning. "I've got my eye on one or two of them, that I mean to buy. The
                  niggers will sell well, I reckon."</p>
               <p>After supper, we strolled again into the barroom. Approaching the counter, my eye
                  fell on the hotel register, which lay open upon it. I glanced involuntarily over
                  the book. Among the arrivals of the previous day, I noticed two recorded in a hand
                  that I at once recognized. The names were, "JOHN HALLET, <hi rend="i"/>New
                  Orleans; JACOB LARKIN, <hi rend="i"/>ditto."</p>
               <p>"Are these gentlemen here?" I asked the bartender.</p>
               <p>"No; they left same day the' come."</p>
               <p>"Where did they go?"</p>
               <p>"Doan't know."</p>
               <p>In five minutes, with my carpet bag strapped to the pommel of the saddle, I was
                  bounding up the road to Trenton.</p>
               <p>It was nearly ten o'clock when I sprang from the horse, and rang the bell at the
                  mansion. A light was burning in the library, but the rest of the house was dark. A
                  negro opened the door.</p>
               <p>"Where is Master Joe, or Miss Selly?"</p>
               <p>"In de library, massa. I'll tell dem you'm yere."</p>
               <p>"No; I'll go myself. Look after my horse."</p>
               <p>I strode through the parlors and the passage way to the old room. Selma was seated
                  on a lounge by the side of Joe, her<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6528-00000127"/>
                  head on his shoulder. As I opened the door, I spoke the two words: "My child!"</p>
               <p>She looked up, sprang to her feet, and rushed into my arms.</p>
               <p>"And you are safe!" I cried, putting back her soft brown hair, and kissing her
                  pale, beautiful forehead.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I am safe. My brother is here—I am <emph>safe.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Joe—God bless you!—you're a noble fellow!"</p>
               <p>He was only twenty-three, but his face was already seamed and haggard, and his
                  hair thickly streaked with white! We sat down, and from Selma's lips I learned the
                  events of the preceding months.</p>

               <p>SELMA arrived at home about a week after her father's funeral. The affairs of the
                  plantation were going on much as usual, but Mrs. Preston was there in apparently
                  the greatest grief. She seemed inconsolable; talked much of her loss, and
                  expressed great fears for the future. Her husband had left no will, and nothing
                  would remain for her but the dower in the real estate, and that would sell for but
                  little.</p>
               <p>The more Preston's affairs were investigated, the worse they appeared. He was in
                  debt everywhere. An administrator was appointed, and he decided that a sale of
                  everything—the two plantations and the negroes—would be necessary.</p>
               <p>Selma felt little interest in the pecuniary result, but sympathy for her
                  stepmother induced her to remain at home, week after week, when her presence there
                  was no longer of service. At last she made preparations to return; but, as she was
                  on the point of departure, Mrs. Preston—whose face then wore an expression of
                  triumphant malignity which chilled Selma's very life-blood—told her that she could
                  not go; that she was a part of her father's estate, and must remain, and be sold
                  with the other negroes!</p>
               <p>Dawsey, shortly prior to this, had become a frequent visitor<pb n="254-255"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000128"/> at the plantation; and, the week before, Phyllis
                  had been dreadfully whipped under his supervision. Selma interceded for her, but
                  could not avert the punishment. She did not at the time know why it was done, but
                  at last the reason was revealed to her.</p>
               <p>Among the papers of the first Mrs. Preston, the second wife had found a bill of
                  sale, by which, in consideration of one gold watch, two diamond rings, an emerald
                  pin, two gold bracelets, some family plate, and other jewelry, of the total value
                  of five hundred dollars, General ——, of Newbern, had conveyed a negro girl called
                  "Lucy," to Mrs. Lucy Preston, wife of Robert Preston, Esq. Said girl was described
                  as seven years old, light complexioned, with long, curly hair, of a golden brown;
                  and the child of Phyllis, otherwise called Phyllis Preston, then the property of
                  Jacob Larkin.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Preston inquired of Phyllis what had become of the child. The nurse denied
                  all knowledge of it; but Selma's age, her peculiar hair, and her strong
                  resemblance to Rosey, excited the Yankee woman's suspicions, and she questioned
                  the mother more closely. Phyllis still denied all knowledge of her child, and, for
                  that denial, was whipped—whipped till her flesh was cut into shreds, and she
                  fainted from loss of blood. After the whipping, she was left in an old cabin, to
                  live or die—her mistress did not care which; and there Ally found her at night, on
                  his return from his work in the swamp. Wrapping her mangled body in an oiled
                  sheet, he conveyed her to his cabin. Dinah carefully nursed her, and ere long she
                  was able to sit up. Then Mrs. Preston told her that, as soon as she was
                  sufficiently recovered to live through it, she would be again and again beaten,
                  till she disclosed the fate of the child.</p>
               <p>She still denied all knowledge of it; but, fearing the rage of her mistress, she
                  sent for her husband, then keeping a small groggery at Trenton, four miles away.
                  He came, and had a conference with Ally and Dinah about the best way of saving his
                  wife from further abuse. Phyllis was unable to walk or to ride, therefore flight
                  was out of the question. Ally proposed that Mulock should oversee his gang for a
                  time, while he remained about home, and kept watch over her. None of the negroes
                  could be induced to whip her in his presence; and if Dawsey or any other white man
                  attempted it, he was free—he would meet them with their own weapons. Mulock agreed
                  to this, and the next day went to the swamp.</p>
               <p>Learning of his presence on the plantation, the mistress sent for him, and, by
                  means of a paltry bribe, induced him to reveal all! Selma thought he loved Phyllis
                  as much as his brutal nature was capable of loving, and that he betrayed her to
                  save her mother from further ill usage.</p>
               <p>The next morning, four strong men entered Ally's cabin before he had left his bed,
                  bound him hand and foot, and dragged Phyllis away, to be again whipped for having
                  refused to betray Selma. Unable to stand, she was tied to a stake, and
                  unmercifully beaten. Weak from the effects of the previous whipping, and crushed
                  in spirit by anxiety for her child, nature could no longer sustain her. A fever
                  set in, and, at the end of a week, she died.</p>
               <p>Selma was told of their relation to each other. The nurse, so devotedly attached
                  to her, and whom she had so long loved, was her own mother! She learned this only
                  in time to see her die, and to hear her last blessing.</p>
               <p>Then Selma experienced all the bitterness of slavery. She<pb n="256-257"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000129"/> was set at work in the kitchen with the other
                  slaves. It seemed that Mrs. Preston took especial delight in assigning to the
                  naturally high-spirited and sensitive girl the most menial employments. Patiently
                  trusting in God that He would send deliverance, she endeavored to perform,
                  uncomplainingly, her allotted tasks. Wholly unaccustomed to such work, weary in
                  body and sick at heart, she dragged herself about from day to day, till at last
                  Mrs. Preston, disgusted with her "laziness," as she termed it, directed her to be
                  taken to the quarters and beaten with fifty lashes!</p>
               <p>Ally had been ordered away by the mistress, and that morning had gone to Trenton
                  to consult the administrator, and get his permission to stay on the plantation.
                  That gentleman—a kind-hearted, upright man—not only told him he could remain, but
                  gave him a written order to take and keep Selma in his custody.</p>
               <p>He returned at night, to find she had been whipped. His blood boiling with rage,
                  he entered the mansion, and demanded to see her. Mrs. Preston declined. He then
                  gave her the order of the administrator. She tore it into fragments, and bade him
                  leave the house. He refused to go without Selma, and quietly seated himself on the
                  sofa. Mrs. Preston then called in ten or twelve of the field hands, and told them
                  to eject him. They either would not or dared not do it; and, without more delay,
                  he proceeded to search for Selma. At last he found her apartment. He burst open
                  the door, and saw her lying on a low, miserable bed, writhing in agony from her
                  wounds. Throwing a blanket over her, he lifted her in his arms, and carried her to
                  his cabin. Dinah carefully attended her, and that night she thanked God,
                  and—slept.</p>
               <p>The next morning, before the sun was fully up, Dawsey and three other white men,
                  heavily armed, came to the cabin, and demanded admittance. Ally refused, and
                  barricaded the door. They finally stealthily effected an entrance through a window
                  in the kitchen, and, breaking down the communication with the "living room," in
                  which apartment the mulatto man and his mother were, they rushed in upon them.
                  Ally, the previous day, had procured a couple of revolvers at Trenton, and Dinah
                  and he, planting themselves before the door of old Deborah's room, in which Selma
                  was sleeping, pointed the weapons at the intruders. The assailants paused, when
                  Dawsey shouted out: "Are you afraid of two d—d niggers—and one a woman!" Aiming
                  his pistol at Ally, he fired. The ball struck the negro's left arm. Discharging
                  two or three barrels at them, the old woman and her son then rushed upon the white
                  men, and they FLED! all but one—he remained; for Dinah caught him in a loving
                  embrace, and pummelled him until he might have been mistaken for calves-foot
                  jelly.</p>
               <p>Ally then sent a messenger to the administrator, who rode over in the afternoon,
                  and took Selma to his own house. There she remained till her brother reached the
                  plantation—three days before my arrival.</p>
               <p>As soon as she was safely at Trenton, Selma wrote to her friends, mailing the
                  letters at that post office. She received no answers. Again and again she wrote;
                  the administrator also wrote, but still no replies came. At last Ally suggested
                  mailing the letters at Newbern, and rode down with one to Joe, one to Alice, and
                  one to Kate.</p>
               <p>Her brother came on at once. In the first ebullition of his anger he ejected his
                  stepmother from the mansion. She went<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6528-00000130"/>
                  to Dawsey's, and, the next day, appeared at the sale with that gentleman; and then
                  announced that for two months she had been the woman-whipper's wife.</p>
               <p>Dawsey had bought the plantation, and most of the furniture, the day before, and
                  had said he intended to buy all of the "prime" negroes.</p>
               <p>As Selma concluded, Joe quietly remarked:</p>
               <p>"He'll be disappointed in that. I allowed him the plantation and furniture,
                  because I've no use for them; but I made him pay more than they are worth. The
                  avails will help me through with father's debts; but not a single hand shall go
                  into his clutches. I shall buy them myself."</p>
               <p>"What will you do with them?"</p>
               <p>"I have bought a plantation near Mobile. I shall put them upon it. Joe will manage
                  them, and I'll live there with Selly."</p>
               <p>"You're a splendid fellow, Joe. But it seems a pity that woman should profane your
                  father's house."</p>
               <p>"Oh! there's no danger of that. I've engaged 'furnished apartments' for her
                  elsewhere."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"The sheriff is asleep up stairs. He has a warrant against her for the murder of
                  Phyllis. When she comes here in the morning, it will be served!"</p>

               <head type="sub">THE NEGRO SALE.</head>
               <p>THE next morning I rose early, and strolled out to the negro quarters. At the
                  distance of about a hundred yards from the mansion, the sun was touching the tops
                  of about thirty canvas camps, and, near them, large numbers of horses, "all
                  saddled and bridled," were picketed among the trees. Some dozens of "natives" were
                  littered around, asleep on the ground; and here and there a barelegged, barefooted
                  woman was lying beside a man on a "spring" mattrass, of the kind that is supposed
                  to have been patented in Paradise.</p>
               <p>It was a beautiful morning in May, and one would have thought, from the appearance
                  of the motley collection, that the whole people had "come up to worship the Lord
                  in their tents," after the manner of the Israelites. The rich planter, the small
                  farmer, the "white trash"—all classes, had gathered to the negro sale, like crows
                  to a feast of carrion.</p>
               <p>A few half-awake, half-sober, russet-clad, bewhiskered "gentry," were lighting
                  fires under huge iron pots; but the larger portion of the "congregation" was still
                  wrapped in slumber.</p>
               <p>Passing them, I knocked at the door of Ally's cabin. The family was already astir,
                  and the various members gave me a<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6528-00000131"/>
                  greeting that cannot be <emph>bought</emph> now anywhere with a handful of
                  "greenbacks." Boss Joe, Aggy, and old Deborah had arrived, and were quartered with
                  Ally.</p>
               <p>"An' 'ou wusn't a gwine ter leff massa Preston's own chile be sole widout bein'
                  yere; wus 'ou, massa Kirke?" cried Dinah, her face beaming all over with
                  pleasurable emotion.</p>
               <p>"No, Dinah; and I've come here so early to tell you how much I think of
                     <emph>you.</emph> A woman that can handle four white men as you did, is fit to
                  head an army."</p>
               <p>"Lor' bress 'ou, massa! dat wusn't nuffin'. I could handle a whole meetin'-house
                  full ob sech as dem."</p>
               <p>"Joe, you know your master's plans, I suppose?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, massa Kirke; he mean ter buy all de folks."</p>
               <p>"But can he raise money enough for the whole?"</p>
               <p>"I reckon so. Massa Joe got a heap."</p>
               <p>"But don't you want to borrow some to help out your pile?"</p>
               <p>"I'se 'bliged ter you, sar; but I reckon I doan't. I'se got nigh on ter free
                  thousan', an' nary one'll pay more'n dat fur a ole man an' two ole wimmin."</p>
               <p>"I hope not."</p>
               <p>I remained there for a half hour, and then strolled back to the mansion. On the
                  lawn, at the side of the house, was the auction block—the carpenter's bench which
                  had officiated at Ally's wedding. It was approached by a flight of steps, and at
                  one end was the salesman's stand—a high stool, in front of which was a small
                  portable desk supported on stakes driven into the ground. Near the block was a
                  booth fitted up for the special accommodation of thirsty buyers. The proprietor
                  was just opening his own and his establishment's peepers, and I looked in upon
                  him. His red, bloated visage seemed familiar to me. Perceiving me, he said:</p>
               <p>"How is ye, stranger? Hev a eye-opener?"</p>
               <p>"I reckon not, old fellow; but I ought to know you. Your name is Tom."</p>
               <p>"Thomas, stranger; but Tom, fur short."</p>
               <p>"Well, Thomas, I thought you had taken your last drink. I saw your store was
                  closed, as I came along."</p>
               <p>"Yas; th' durned 'ristocrats driv me out uv thet nigh a yar ago."</p>
               <p>"And where are you now?"</p>
               <p>"Up ter Trenton. I'm doin' right smart thar. Me an' Mulock—thet used ter b'long
                  yere—is in partenship. But whar moight ye hev seed me, stranger?"</p>
               <p>"At your store, over ten years since. I bought a woman there. You were having a
                  turkey match at the time."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yas! I 'call ye now. An' th' pore gal's dead! Thet d—d Yankee 'ooman shud
                  pull hemp fur thet."</p>
               <p>"Yes; but the devil seldom gets his due in this world."</p>
               <p>'Thet ar's a fact, stranger. Come, hev a drink; I woan't ax ye a red."</p>
               <p>"No, excuse me, Tom; it's before breakfast;" and, walking off, I entered the
                  mansion.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>Shortly after breakfast the people from the neighboring plantations began to
                  gather to the sale, and, by the hour appointed for it to commence, about five
                  hundred men and women had collected on the ground. Some were on horseback, some in
                  carriages, but the majority were seated on the grass, or on benches improvised for
                  the occasion.</p>
               <pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6528-00000132"/>
               <p>A few minutes before the "exercises" commenced, the negroes were marched upon the
                  lawn. No seats had been provided for them, and they huddled together inside a
                  small area staked off for their reception. They were of all colors and ages.
                  Husbands and wives, parents and children, grandparents and grandchildren, aunts,
                  uncles, and cousins, gathered in little family groups, and breathlessly awaited
                  the stroke of the hammer which was to decide their destiny. They were all clad in
                  their Sunday clothes, and looked clean and tidy; but on every face except Joe's
                  was depicted an ill-defined feeling of dread and consternation. Husbands held
                  their wives in their arms, and mothers hugged their children to their bosoms, as
                  if they might soon part forever; but when old Joe passed among them, saying a low
                  word to this one and the other, their cloudy visages brightened, and a heavy load
                  seemed to roll off their hearts. Joe was as radiant as a summer morning, and
                  walked about with a quiet dignity and unconcern that might have led one to think
                  him the owner of the entire "invoice of chattels."</p>
               <p>As the auctioneer—a spruce importation from Newbern—mounted the bench, a splendid
                  carriage, drawn by two magnificent grays, and driven by a darky in livery, made
                  its way through the crowd, and drew up opposite the stand. In it were Dawsey and
                  his wife!</p>
               <p>The salesman's hammer came down. "Gentlemen and ladies," he said, "the sale has
                  commenced. I am about to offer you one hundred and sixty-one likely negro men and
                  women, belonging to the estate of Robert Preston, Esq., deceased. Each one will be
                  particularly described when put up, and all will be warranted as represented. They
                  will be sold in families; that is, husbands and wives, and parents and young
                  children, will not be separated. The terms are, one quarter cash, the balance in
                  one year, secured by an approved indorsed note. Persons having claims against the
                  estate will be allowed to pay by authenticated accounts and duebills. The first
                  lot I shall offer you will be the mulatto man Joe and his wife Agnes. Joe is known
                  through all this region as a negro of uncommon worth and intelligence. He
                  is——"</p>
               <p>Here he was interrupted by Dawsey, who exclaimed, in a hurried manner:</p>
               <p>"I came here expecting this sale would be conducted according to custom—that each
                  hand would be put up separately. I protest against this innovation, Mr.
                  Auctioneer."</p>
               <p>The auctioneer made no reply; but the administrator, a small, self-possessed man,
                  mounted the bench, and said:</p>
               <p>"Sir, <emph>I</emph> regulate this sale. If you are not satisfied with its
                  conditions, you are not obliged to bid."</p>
               <p>Dawsey made a passionate reply. In the midst of it, Joe sprang upon the stand,
                  and, in a clear, determined voice, called out:</p>
               <p>"Mr. Sheriff, do your duty."</p>
               <p>A large, powerful man, in blue coat and brass buttons, stepped to the side of the
                  carriage, and, coolly opening the door, said:</p>
               <p>"Catherine Dawsey, you are charged with aiding and abetting in the murder of
                  Phyllis Preston. I arrest you. Please come with me."</p>
               <p>"By ——, sir!" cried Dawsey; "this lady is my wife!"</p>
               <p>"It makes no difference whose wife she is, sir. She is my prisoner."</p>
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6528-00000133"/>
               <p>"She must not be touched by you, or any other man!" yelled Dawsey, drawing his
                  pistol. Before he could fire, he rolled on to the ground, insensible. The sheriff
                  had struck him a quick blow on the head with a heavy cane.</p>
               <p>As her husband fell, Mrs. Dawsey sprang upon the driver's seat, and, seizing the
                  reins from the astonished negro, applied the lash to the horses. They reared, and
                  started. The panic-stricken crowd parted, like waves in a storm, and the spirited
                  animals bounded swiftly down the avenue. They had nearly reached the cluster of
                  liveoaks which borders the small lake, when a man sprang at their heads. He missed
                  them, fell, and the carriage passed over him; but the horses shied from the road
                  into the trees, and in an instant the splendid vehicle was a mass of fragments,
                  and Mrs. Preston and the negro were sprawling on the ground. The lady was taken up
                  senseless, and badly hurt, but breathing. The driver was dead!</p>
               <p>The crowd hurried across the green to the scene of disaster. Joe and I reached the
                  man in the road at the same instant. It was Ally! We took him up, bore him to the
                  edge of the pond, and bathed his forehead with water. In a few minutes he opened
                  his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Are you much hurt, Ally?" asked Joe, with almost breathless eagerness.</p>
               <p>"I reckon not, massa Joe," said Ally; "my head, yere, am sore, an' dis ankle
                  p'raps am broke. Leff me see;" and he rose to his feet, and tried his leg. "No,
                  massa Joe; it'm sound's a pine knot. I hain't done fur <emph>dis</emph> time."</p>
               <p>"Thank God!" exclaimed Joe, with an indescribable expression of relief.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dawsey was borne to the mansion, the negro carried off to the quarters, and,
                  in a few moments, the crowd once more gathered around the auctioneer's stand.
                  Dawsey, by this time recovered from the sheriff's blow, was cursing and swearing
                  terribly over the disaster to his wife and—his property.</p>
               <p>"Twenty-five hundred dollars gone at a blow! D—n the woman; didn't she know better
                  than that?"</p>
               <p>As he followed his wife into the house, the sheriff said to the administrator, who
                  was a justice of the peace:</p>
               <p>"Make me out a warrant for that man—obstructing the execution of the law."</p>
               <p>The warrant was soon made out, and in fifteen minutes, Dawsey, raving like a wild
                  animal, was driven off to jail at Trenton. Mrs. Preston, too much injured to be
                  moved, was left under guard at the mansion, and the sale proceeded.</p>
               <p>Boss Joe and Aggy ascended the block, and "Master Joe" took a stand beside
                  them.</p>
               <p>"How much is said for these prime negroes?" cried the auctioneer. "Everybody knows
                  what they are, and there's no use preaching a sermon over them. Boss Joe might do
                  that, but <emph>I</emph> can't. He can preach equal to any white man you ever
                  hard. Come, gentlemen, start a bid. How much do you say?"</p>
               <p>"A thousand," said a voice in the crowd.</p>
               <p>"Eleven hundred," cried another.</p>
               <p>"It's a d—d shame to bid on them, gentlemen. Boss Joe has been saving money to buy
                  himself; and I think no white man should bid against him," cried a man at my
                  elbow.</p>
               <p>It was Gaston, who had just arrived on the ground.</p>
               <p>"Thet's a fact." "Them's my sentiments." "D—n th'<pb n="266-267"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000134"/> man thet'll bid agin a nigger." "Thet's so,
                  Gaston," echoed from all directions.</p>
               <p>"But I yere th' darky's got a pile—some two thousan'; <emph>thet</emph> gwoes
                  'long with him, uv course," yelled one of the crowd.</p>
               <p>"Of course it don't!" said young Joe, from the stand. "He's saved about three
                  thousand out of a commission his master allowed him; but he <emph>gave</emph> that
                     <emph>to me,</emph> long before my father died. It is <emph>mine</emph>—not
                     <emph>his.</emph> I bid twelve hundred for him and his wife; and I will say to
                  the audience, that I shall advance on whatever sum may be offered for them. So
                  fire away, gentlemen; I ask no favors."</p>
               <p>"Is there any more bid for this excellent couple?" cried the auctioneer. "It is my
                  duty to cry them, and to tell you they're worth twice that money."</p>
               <p>There was no more bid, and Boss Joe and Aggy were struck down at twelve hundred
                  dollars—about two thirds their market value.</p>
               <p>"Now, gentlemen, we will offer you the old negress, Deborah, the mother of Joe.
                  Bring her forward!" cried the man of the hammer.</p>
               <p>Four strong negroes lifted the chair of the aged African, and bore her to the
                  block. When the strange vehicle reached the steps, young Preston steadied it into
                  its appropriate position, and then took a stand beside it.</p>
               <p>"This aged lady, gentlemen, is warranted over eighty; she may be a hundred. She
                  can't walk, but she can pray and sing to kill. How much is bid for all this piety
                  done up in black crape?" cried the auctioneer, smiling complacently, as if
                  conscious of saying a witty thing.</p>
               <p>Joe turned on him quickly. "Sir, you are employed to <emph>sell</emph> these
                  people, not to sport with their feelings. Let me hear no more of this."</p>
               <p>"No offence, Mr. Preston. Gentlemen, how much is bid for old Deborah?"</p>
               <p>"Five dollars," said young Preston.</p>
               <p>The old negress, who sat nearly double, straightened up her bent form, and,
                  looking at Joe with a sad, pleading expression, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Oh, massa Joe! ole nussy 'm wuth more'n dat. 'Ou woan't leff har be sole fur no
                  sech money as dat, will 'ou, massa Joe?"</p>
               <p>"No, aunty; not if you want to bring more. I'd give your weight in gold for you;"
                  and, turning to the auctioneer, he said: "A hundred dollars is my bid, sir."</p>
               <p>"Bress 'ou, massa Joe! bress 'ou! 'Ou'm my own dear, bressed chile!" exclaimed the
                  old negress, clutching at his hand, and, with a sudden effort, rising to her feet.
                  She stood thus for a moment, then she staggered back, fell into her chair, uttered
                  a low moan, and—was FREE!</p>
               <p>A wild excitement followed, during which the body was borne off. It was a full
                  half hour before quiet was restored and the sale resumed. Then about twenty
                  negroes, of both sexes, were put up singly. All of them were bought by Joe, except
                  a young woman, whose husband belonged to Gaston. The bidding on her was spirited,
                  and she was run up to ten hundred and fifty dollars. As Gaston bid that sum, he
                  jumped upon a bench, and called out:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, I can stand this as long as you can. I mean to have this woman,
                  anyhow."</p>
               <pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6528-00000135"/>
               <p>No one offered more, and "the lot" was struck off to Gaston. Joe did not bid on
                  her at all.</p>
               <p>When the next negro ascended the stand, Joe beckoned to me, and said:</p>
               <p>"Selly is next on the catalogue. Will you bring her here?"</p>
               <p>As I entered the mansion, she met me. Her face was pale, and there was a nervous
                  twitching about her mouth, but she quietly said:</p>
               <p>"You have come for me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my child. Have courage; it will soon be over."</p>
               <p>She laid her head upon my shoulder for a moment; then, turning her large, clear,
                  but tearless eyes up to mine, she said:</p>
               <p>"I trust in GOD!"</p>
               <p>I took her arm in mine, and walked out to the stand. The auctioneer was waiting
                  for her, and we ascended the block together. A slight tremor passed over her frame
                  as she met the sea of upturned faces, all eagerly gazing at her; and, putting my
                  arm about her, I whispered:</p>
               <p>"Do not fear. Lean on me."</p>
               <p>"I do not fear," was the low reply.</p>
               <p>"Now, gentlemen," cried the auctioneer, in an unfeeling, business-like way, "I
                  offer you the girl, Lucy Selma. She is seventeen years old; in good health; well
                  brought up—a superior lot every way. She has recently been employed at cooking,
                  but, as you see, is better adapted to lighter work. How much shall I have for her?
                  Come, bid fast, gentlemen; we are taking up too much time."</p>
               <p>Before any response could be made to this appeal, Joe stepped to the side of
                  Selma, and, in a slow, deliberate voice, said:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen, allow me a few words. This young lady is my sister. I have always
                  supposed—she has always supposed that she was the legitimate child of my father.
                  She was not. My mother bought her when she was very young; gave her jewels—all she
                  had—for her, and adopted her as her own child. The law does not allow a married
                  woman to hold separate property, and Selma is therefore inventoried in my father's
                  estate, and must be sold. Rightfully, she belongs to me! She has been delicately
                  and tenderly reared, and is totally unfitted for any of the usual work of slave
                  women. Her value for such purposes is very little. I shall bid a thousand dollars
                  for her, which is more than she is worth for any honest use. If any man bids more,
                  it is HIS LIFE OR MINE <emph>before he leaves the ground!</emph>"</p>
               <p>A breathless silence fell on the assemblage. It lasted for a few moments, when
                  Gaston called out:</p>
               <p>"Come, Joe, this isn't fair. You've no right to interfere with the sale. I came
                  here prepared to go twenty-five hundred for her myself."</p>
               <p>In a firm but moderate tone, the young man replied:</p>
               <p>"I intend no disrespect to you, Mr. Gaston, or to any gentleman present; but I
                  mean what I say. I shall stand by my words!"</p>
               <p>"Come, youngster, none uv yer browbeatin' yere. It woan't gwo down," cried a rough
                  voice from among the audience. "I've come all th' way from Orleans ter buy thet
                  gal; an' buy har I shill!"</p>
               <p>Quite a commotion followed this speech. It lasted some minutes, and the speaker
                  was the object of considerable attention.</p>
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6528-00000136"/>
               <p>"He's some on th' trigger, ole feller," cried one. "He kin hit a turkey's eye at
                  two hundred paces, he kin," said another. "He'll burn yer in'ards, shore," shouted
                  a third. "Ye'll speak fur warm lodgin's, ef ye bid on thet gal, ye wull," cried a
                  fourth.</p>
               <p>"Come, my friends, ye karn't skeer me," coolly said the first speaker, mounting
                  one of the rough benches. "I've h'ard sech talk afore. It doan't turn
                     <emph>me</emph> a hair. I come yere ter buy thet gal, an' buy har I shill,
                  'cept some on ye kin gwo higher'n my pile; an' my pile ar <emph>eighty-two hundred
                     dollars!</emph>"</p>
               <p>He was a tall, stoutly-built man, with bushy gray whiskers and a clear, resolute
                  eye. It was Larkin!</p>
               <p>Turning to Joe, I exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"I understand this. Get the auctioneer to postpone the sale for half an hour. Take
                  Selly into the house."</p>
               <p>"No. It might as well be over first as last. Let him bid—he's a dead man!" replied
                  Joe, coolly, but firmly.</p>
               <p>"You're mad, boy. Would you take his life needlessly?"</p>
               <p>The auctioneer, who overheard these remarks, then said to me:</p>
               <p>"I will adjourn the sale, sir;" and, turning to the audience, he cried, drawing
                  out his watch: "Gentlemen, it is twelve o'clock. The sale is adjourned for an
                  hour, to give you a chance for dinner."</p>
               <p>Joe led Selma away, and, springing from the block, I pressed through the crowd to
                  where Larkin was standing.</p>
               <p>"Larkin," I said, placing my hand on his arm, "come with me."</p>
               <p>"Who in h—ar ye?" he asked, turning on me rather roughly.</p>
               <p>"My name is Kirke. You ought to know me."</p>
               <p>"Kirke! Why, ye ar! I'm right down glad ter see ye, Mr. Kirke," he exclaimed,
                  seizing me warmly by the hand.</p>
               <p>"Come with me; I want to talk with you."</p>
               <p>He sprang from the bench, and followed me into the mansion.</p>
               <p>Entering the library, I locked the door. When he was seated, I said:</p>
               <p>"Now, Larkin, who do you want this girl for?"</p>
               <p>"Wall, I swar! Mr. Kirke, ye fire right at th' bull's eye!" Then, hesitating a
                  moment, he added:</p>
               <p>"Fur myself."</p>
               <p>"No, you don't; you know that isn't true."</p>
               <p>"Ha! ha! This ar th' second time ye've told me I lied. Nary other man ever done it
                  twice, Mr. Kirke; but I karn't take no 'fence with ye, nohow—ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>"Come, Larkin, don't waste time. Tell me squarely—<emph>who</emph> do you want
                  this girl for?"</p>
               <p>"Wall, Mr. Kirke, I can't answer thet—not in honor."</p>
               <p>"Shall <emph>I</emph> tell <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Yas, ef ye kin!"</p>
               <p>"John Hallet."</p>
               <p>"Wall, I'm d—d ef ye doan't take th' papers. Who in creashun told ye thet?"</p>
               <p>"No one; I <emph>know</emph> it. Hallet's only son is engaged to this girl. He
                  wants her, to balk him."</p>
               <p>"Ye're wrong thar. He wants har fur <emph>himself.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"For himself!"</p>
               <p>"Yas; he's got a couple now. He's a sly old fox; but he's one on 'em."</p>
               <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6528-00000137"/>
               <p>"Is he willing to pay eighty-two hundred dollars for a mistress?"</p>
               <p>"Wall, Preston owes him a debt, an' he reckons 'tain't wuth a hill o' beans.
                  Thet's th' amount uv it."</p>
               <p>Thus the wrong of the father was to be atoned for by the dishonor of the child!
                  Preston was right: the curse which followed his sin had fallen on all he loved—on
                  his wife, his mistress, the octoroon girl, his manly, noble son; and now, the
                  cloud which held the thunderbolt was hovering over the head of his best-loved
                  child! And so He visiteth "the sins of the fathers upon the children!"</p>
               <p>"But he is wrong! Preston's estate will pay its debts. If it does not, Joe will
                  make good the deficiency. I will guarantee Hallet's claim. See him, and tell him
                  so."</p>
               <p>"He hain't yere, an' woan't be yere. He allers fights shy. An' 'Twouldn't be uv no
                  use. He's made up his mind to hev th' gal, an' hev har he will. He's come all th'
                  way from Orleans ter make shore uv it."</p>
               <p>"But, Larkin, you've a heart under your waistcoat; <emph>you</emph> won't lend
                  yourself to the designs of such a consummate scoundrel as Hallet!"</p>
               <p>"Scoundrel's a hard word, Mr. Kirke. 'Tain't used much round yere; when it ar, it
                  draws blood like a lancet."</p>
               <p>"I mean no offence to you, Larkin; but it's true—I will prove it;" and I went on
                  to detail my early acquaintance with Hallet; his vast profession and small
                  performance of piety; his betrayal of Frank's mother; his treatment of his son,
                  and all the damning record I have spread before the reader.</p>
               <p>As I talked, Larkin rose, and walked the room, evidently affected; but, when I
                  concluded, he said:</p>
               <p>"'Tain't no use, Mr. Kirke; I'd ruther ye wouldn't say no more. It makes me feel
                  like the cholera. An' 'tain't no use! I've <emph>got</emph> ter buy th' gal."</p>
               <p>"You have <emph>not</emph> got to buy her! You need only go away. I will give you
                  a thousand dollars, if you will go at once."</p>
               <p>"No, no, Mr. Kirke; I karn't do it. I'd like ter 'blige ye, and I need money like
                  th' devil; but I karn't leave Hallet in th' lurch. 'Twouldn't be far dealin'
                  'tween man an' man. He trusts me ter do it, an' I'm in with him. I
                     <emph>must</emph> act honest."</p>
               <p>"How <emph>in</emph> with him?"</p>
               <p>"Why, he an' ole Roye ar tergether. The' find th' money fur my bis'ness—done it
                  fur fifteen yar. The' git th' biggest sheer, but I karn't holp myself. I went
                  inter cotton, like a d—d fool, 'bout a yar ago, an' lost all I hed—every red cent;
                  an' now I shud be on my beam ends ef it warn't fur them."</p>
               <p>"Then Hallet has made his money dealing in negroes!"</p>
               <p>"Yas, a right smart pile, in thet, an' cotton. He got me inter th' d—d staple. I
                  hed nigh on ter sixty thousan' then—hard rocks; but I lost it all—every dollar—at
                  one slap; though I reckon <emph>he</emph> managed, somehow, ter git out."</p>
               <p>"Yes, of course <emph>he</emph> got out, and saddled the loss upon you. Were you
                  such a fool as not to see that?"</p>
               <p>"P'raps he did; but he covered his trail. He's smart; ye karn't track
                     <emph>him.</emph> But it makes no odds; I <emph>hev</emph> ter keep in with
                  him. I couldn't do a thing, ef I didn't."</p>
               <p>"Yes, you could. Come North. I'll give you honest work to do."</p>
               <p>"You're a gentleman, Mr. Kirke, an' I'm 'bliged ter ye;<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000138"/> but I karn't leave yere. I've got a wife an'
                  chil'ren, an' the' wouldn't live 'mong ye abolitionists, nohow."</p>
               <p>"You have a wife and children?"</p>
               <p>"Yas; a wife, an' two as likely young 'uns as ye ever seed—boy 'bout seven, an'
                  gal 'bout twelve."</p>
               <p>"Well, Larkin, suppose <emph>your</emph> little girl was upon that auction block;
                  suppose some villain had hired <emph>me</emph> to aid in debauching her; suppose
                  you, her father, should come to me and plead with me not to do it; suppose I
                  should tell you what you have told me, and then—should go out and buy
                     <emph>your</emph> child; what would you do? Would you not curse me with your
                  very last breath?"</p>
               <p>He seated himself, and hung down his head, but made no reply.</p>
               <p>"Answer me, like the honest man you are."</p>
               <p>"Wall, I reckon I shud."</p>
               <p>"Selma is to marry my adopted son. She is as dear to me as your child is to you.
                  Can you do to her, what you would curse me for doing to <emph>your</emph> child?
                  Look me in the face. Don't flinch—answer me!"</p>
               <p>I rose, and stood before him. In a few moments he also rose, and, looking me
                  squarely in the eye—there was a tear in his—he brought his hand down upon mine
                  with a concussion that might have been heard a mile off, and said:</p>
               <p>"No, I'm d—d ter h—ef I kin."</p>
               <p>"You are a splendid, noble fellow, Larkin."</p>
               <p>"Ye're 'bout th' fust man thet ever said so, Mr. Kirke. Ye told me suthin' like
                  thet nigh on ter twelve yar ago. I hain't forgot it yit, an' I never shill."</p>
               <p>"You're rough on the outside, Larkin, but sound at the core—sound as a nut. I wish
                  the world had more like you. Leave this wretched work!"</p>
               <p>"I'd like ter, but I karn't. What kin a feller do, with neither money nor
                  friends?"</p>
               <p>"Get into some honest business. I know you can. I'll help you—Joe will help you.
                  We'll talk things over to-night, and I know Joe will rig out something for
                  you."</p>
               <p>He remained seated for a while, saying nothing; then he rose, and, the moisture
                  dimming his eyes, said:</p>
               <p>"I reckon ye're not over pious, Mr. Kirke, an' I <emph>know</emph> ye'd stand a
                  hand at a rough an' tumble; but d—d ef thet hain't th' sort o' religion I like.
                  Come, sir; ef I stay yere, ye'll make a 'ooman on me."</p>
               <p>As we passed into the parlor, I said to Joe, who was seated there with Selma:</p>
               <p>"Give Larkin your hand, Joe; he's a glorious fellow."</p>
               <p>"My <emph>heart</emph> is in it, Larkin," said the young man, very cordially. "It
                  would have come hard to draw a bead on <emph>you.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"I knows it would, Joe, an' I wus ter blame; but I never could stand a bluff."</p>
               <p>We passed out together to the auction stand. Selma and her brother ascended the
                  block, while Larkin and I mingled with the buyers, who had collected in even
                  larger numbers than before. The auctioneer brought down his hammer:</p>
               <p>"Attention, gentlemen! The sale has begun. I offer you again the girl, Lucy Selma.
                  You've h'ard the description, and (glancing at Joe, and smiling) you know the
                     <emph>conditions</emph> of the sale. A thousand dollars is bid for the girl,
                  Lucy Selma; do I hear any more? Talk quick, gentlemen; I<pb n="276-277"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000139"/> shan't dwell on this lot; so speak up, if you've
                  anything to say. One thousand once—one thousand twice—one thousand third and last
                  call. Do I hear any more?" A pause of a moment. "Last call, gentlemen.
                  Going—g-o-i-n-g—go——"</p>
               <p>The word was unfinished; the hammer was descending, when a voice called out:</p>
               <p>"Two thousand!"</p>
               <p>"Whose bid is that?" cried Joe, striding across the bench, the glare of a hyena in
                  his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Mine, sir!" said the man, with a look of sudden surprise. His face was shaded by
                  a broad-brimmed Panama hat, and his hair and whiskers were dyed, but there was no
                  mistaking his large, eagle nose, his sharp, pointed chin, and his rat-trap of a
                  mouth. It was Hallet!</p>
               <p>Springing upon a bench near by, I cried out:</p>
               <p>"John Hallet, withdraw that bid, or your time has come! I warn you. You cannot
                  leave this place alive!"</p>
               <p>He gave me a quick, startled look—the look of a thief caught in the act—but said
                  nothing.</p>
               <p>"Who is he?" cried a dozen voices.</p>
               <p>"A Yankee nigger-trader! A man that seduced and murdered the woman who should have
                  been his wife; that cast out and starved his own child, and now would debauch this
                  poor girl, who is to marry his only son!"</p>
               <p>"Wall, he <emph>ar</emph> a han'some critter." "'Bout like th' Yankees gin'rally."
                  "Clar him out!" cried several voices.</p>
               <p>"If you allow him to bid here, you are as bad as he," I continued, unintentionally
                  fanning the growing excitement.</p>
               <p>"Wall, we woan't." "Pitch inter him!" "Douse him in th' pond!" "Ride him on a
                  rail!" "Give him a coat uv tar!" and a hundred similar exclamations rose from the
                  crowd, which swayed toward the obnoxious man with a quick, tumultuous motion.</p>
               <p>"He'm in de darky trade; leff de darkies handle him!" cried Ally, seizing Hallet
                  by the collar, and dragging him toward the pond.</p>
               <p>The face of the great merchant turned ghastly pale. Paralyzed with fear, he made
                  no resistance.</p>
               <p>Pressing rapidly through the crowd, and tossing Ally aside as if he had been a
                  bundle of feathers, Larkin was at Hallet's side in an instant. Planting himself
                  before him, and drawing his revolver, he cried out:</p>
               <p>"Far play, gintlemen, far play. He's a cowardly scoundrel, but he shill hev far
                  play, or my name hain't Jake Larkin!"</p>
               <p>Instinctively the crowd fell back a few paces, and Larkin, with more coolness,
                  continued:</p>
               <p>"Th' only man yere thet's got ary thing ter say in this bis'ness ar Joe Preston;
                  an' <emph>he'll</emph> guv even a Yankee far play. Woan't ye, Joe?" he cried.
                  Then, turning quickly to his partner, he added: "Ye didn't know th' kunditions,
                  Mr. Hallet, did ye? Speak quick."</p>
               <p>"No—I—didn't know I was—giving offence," stammered Hallet, looking in the
                  direction in which Larkin's eyes were turned.</p>
               <p>Selma had taken the auctioneer's chair, and Joe stood, with folded arms, glaring
                  on Hallet.</p>
               <p>"Come, Joe," continued Larkin, "I've done ye a good turn ter-day. Let him off, an'
                  put it ter my 'count."</p>
               <p>"As you say, Larkin; but he must withdraw his bid, and leave the ground at
                  once."</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6528-00000140"/>
               <p>"I withdraw it, sir," said Hallet, in a cringing tone, clinging fast to the negro
                  trader.</p>
               <p>"Doan't hold on so tight, Mr. Hallet. Lord bless ye! nary one yere'll hurt ye;
                  they'm gentler'n lambs—ha! ha! But when ye want anuther gal, doan't ye come
                     <emph>yere</emph> fur yer darter-in-law—ha! ha!"</p>
               <p>Putting his arm within Hallet's, he then attempted to press through the crowd; but
                  the blood of the chivalry had risen, and, spite of Joe's remarks, they showed no
                  inclination to let the Yankee off so cheaply. Forming a solid wall around him,
                  they blocked Larkin's way at every turn, and cries of "Let him alone, Larkin!"
                  "Cool him off, boys!" "Doan't ye spile th' fun, Larkin!" "Guv th' feller a little
                  hosspitaplity!" echoed from all directions.</p>
               <p>Putting up his revolver, Larkin turned to them, and said, in the mildest and
                  blandest tone conceivable:</p>
               <p>"Thet's right, boys—ye <emph>orter</emph> hev some fun; but this gintleman's sick.
                  Doan't ye see how pale he ar? He couldn't stand it, nohow. But thar's a feller
                  thet kin," pointing to Mulock, who stood looking on, at the outer edge of the
                  crowd.</p>
               <p>"Ef ye're spilin' fur sport, ye moight try yer hand on him!"</p>
               <p>"Yas, he'm de man!" cried Ally. "He holped whip de young missus. He telled on har
                  fur twenty dollar. He'm de man!"</p>
               <p>Mulock did not seem to realize, at once, that he was the subject of these remarks.
                  The moment he did, he sprang out of the crowd, and darted off for the woods at the
                  top of his speed. A hundred men followed him, with cries of "Mount, head him off!"
                  "Five dollars ter th' man thet kotches him!" "Take him, dead or alive!"</p>
               <p>Amid the universal excitement and confusion that followed, Larkin walked rapidly
                  away with Hallet.</p>
               <p>"You can heat the kettle, boys; Mulock can't run," cried Joe, from the platform.
                  "But you must give him a fair trial."</p>
               <p>"We'll do thet, never ye fear!" echoed a dozen voices.</p>
               <p>"I nominate his friend, Mr. Gaston, for judge," said Joe.</p>
               <p>"Gaston it is! Gaston it is!" "Mount the bench, Mr. Gaston!" shouted a hundred
                  "natives."</p>
               <p>Gaston got upon the auction stand, and said:</p>
               <p>"I'll serve, gentlemen; but, before we select jurors, the sale must go on. Miss
                  Preston is not sold yet."</p>
               <p>"All right! all right! Hurry up, Mr. Hammerman!" shouted the crowd.</p>
               <p>The auctioneer took his place:</p>
               <p>"A thousand dollars is bid for this young lady. Going—going—<emph>gone,</emph> to
                  Mr. Joseph Preston.</p>
               <p>Selma put her arms about Joe's neck, and, in broken tones, said: "My brother! my
                  dear brother!" Then she laid her head on his shoulder, and wept—wept
                  unrestrainedly.</p>
               <p>Who can fathom the untold misery she had endured within those two hours!</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXVII.</head>
               <head type="sub">THE LYNCHING.</head>
               <p>THE impromptu judge took his seat on the bench, and the excited multitude once
                  more subsided into quiet. In about fifteen minutes a tumult arose in a remote
                  quarter of the ground, and Mulock and his pursuers appeared in sight, shouting,
                  screaming, and swearing in a decidedly boisterous manner. The most of the
                  profanity—to the credit of the self-appointed <foreign xml:lang="LAT">posse
                     comitatus</foreign> be it said—was indulged in by the ex-overseer, who, with
                  his clothes torn in shreds, and his face covered with blood, looked like the
                  battered relic of a forty years' war. A red bandanna pinioned his arms to his
                  sides, and a strong man at each elbow spurred his flagging footsteps by an
                  occasional poke with a pine branch. Ally followed at a few paces, looking about as
                  dilapidated as the culprit himself. To him evidently belonged the glory of the
                  capture.</p>
               <p>As they approached the stand, Gaston rose, and called out:</p>
               <p>"Do not insult justice, by bringing the prisoner into court in this condition. Let
                  his face be washed, his garments changed, and his wounds bound up, before he
                  appears for trial. Dr. Rawson, I commission you special officer for the duty."</p>
               <p>"I'm at your service, Major Gaston," said the doctor, stepping out from the crowd
                  into the open semicircle in front of the bench. "Will some one procure the loan of
                  a coat, hat, and trousers at the mansion?"</p>
               <p>Ally started for the needed clothing, and the physician led the way to the small
                  lake. In about twenty minutes the volunteer officials returned with the criminal,
                  clothed in a more respectable manner, and Gaston said to him:</p>
               <p>"Prisoner, take your place."</p>
               <p>Resistance was useless, and Mulock, with a slow step, and a sullen, dogged air,
                  ascended the platform, and seated himself in the chair provided for him at its
                  further extremity. Gaston sat at the other end, facing him; and four brawny
                  "natives," with revolvers in their hands, took positions by his side.</p>
               <p>"Silence in the court!" cried Gaston.</p>
               <p>The noisy multitude became quiet, and the extempore official proceeded—with
                  greater solemnity than many another judge of more regular appointment exhibits on
                  similar occasions—to say:</p>
               <p>"Prisoner, you are charged with two of the highest offences known to our laws;
                  namely, with aiding and abetting an illegal and cruel assault on a white woman,
                  and with procuring and inciting the murder of your own wife. You are about to be
                  tried for these crimes by a jury of your countrymen; and I am appointed judge,
                  that full and impartial justice may be done you. It shall be done. Counsel will be
                  awarded you; and, that you may not be condemned by prejudiced men, you will be
                  given the privilege of peremptory challenge against four out of every five of the
                  jurors I shall nominate. I shall now proceed to name the jury, and you will
                  signify your objection to those you do not approve. Thomas Murchison."</p>
               <pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6528-00000142"/>
               <p>That gentleman came forward, and Mulock said:</p>
               <p>"I take him."</p>
               <p>"Godfrey Banks."</p>
               <p>"He's inimy ter me."</p>
               <p>The man stepped aside; and thus they proceeded, the prisoner taking full advantage
                  of the liberty of choice allowed him, until, out of a panel of nearly sixty,
                  twelve respectable, yeomanly-looking men had been selected. As each juror was
                  approved of by the crowd (who had the final decision), he took a seat on a row of
                  benches facing the "judge" and the prisoner. When the last one had taken his
                  place, Gaston said:</p>
               <p>"Prisoner, you have heard the charges against you; are you guilty, or not guilty?
                  If you think proper to acknowledge your guilt of either or both the crimes with
                  which you are charged, I shall feel it my duty to award you a lighter
                  punishment."</p>
               <p>"I hain't guilty uv 'ary one on 'em," said Mulock, without looking up.</p>
               <p>"What legal gentleman will appear for the people?" cried Gaston, turning to the
                  audience. Several sprigs of the law shot out from the multitude. "I accept
                     <emph>you,</emph> Mr. Flanders. Who will act for the prisoner?"</p>
               <p>Each one of the volunteers fell back, and no response came from any part of the
                  ground. Mulock evidently was neither blessed nor cursed with many friends.</p>
               <p>"Does no one appear for the prisoner? Gentlemen of the legal profession, I am
                  sorry to see this reluctance to aid a defenceless man. Will not some one oblige
                     <emph>me,</emph> by volunteering? I shall consider it a personal service," said
                  Gaston.</p>
               <p>Still no response was heard. At least five minutes passed, and the "judge's" face
                  was assuming a look of painful concern, when Larkin approached the bench.</p>
               <p>"Gintlemen," he said, "th' man hain't no friends, an' it's a d—d shame not ter
                  come out fur a feller as stands alone. Ef I knowed lor, I'd go in fur him, ef he
                  wus th' devil himself."</p>
               <p>No one came forward in answer to even this appeal; and, turning on the crowd,
                  while warm, manly scorn glowed on his every feature, the negro-trader cried
                  out:</p>
               <p>"Ye're a set uv d—d sneakin' hounds, every one on ye. Ye're wuss than th' parsons;
                  an' the' hain't fit ter tote vittles ter a bar." Turning to the "judge," he added,
                  in a more respectful tone: "I doan't know th' fust thing 'bout lor, Major Gaston,
                  an' this man's nigh as mean a cuss as th' Lord ever made; but ef ye'll 'cept me,
                  I'll go in fur him!"</p>
               <p>"I will accept you, with pleasure. You're doing a gentlemanly thing, Mr.
                  Larkin."</p>
               <p>A murmur of applause went round the assemblage, as Larkin and the other counsel
                  took seats near the jury.</p>
               <p>The "judge" then rose, and said:</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen of the Jury: You have engaged in a solemn office. You are about to try
                  a fellow being for his life. It is a painful duty, but it is an obligation you owe
                  to the community, and to yourselves, and you will not shrink from it. Society is
                  held together by laws made to protect the innocent and punish the guilty. But, as
                     <emph>our</emph> society is organized, there are some offences which our
                  tribunals cannot reach. In such cases the people, from whom all laws proceed, have
                  a right to take the law into their own hands.</p>
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6528-00000143"/>
               <p>"The prisoner is charged with crimes which, from the circumstances surrounding
                  their commission, cannot be reached by regular courts of justice. They were
                  witnessed by none but blacks, whose testimony, by our statutes, is not admissible.
                  We, the people, therefore, are to try him; and, to get at the facts, we shall
                  receive the evidence of negroes. You will judge for yourselves as to its
                  credibility. If any doubt of the prisoner's guilt rests in your minds, you will
                  give him the benefit of it, and acquit him; but if, on the other hand, you are
                  fully persuaded that he committed either or both the crimes of which he is
                  accused, you will convict him. <emph>You</emph> will patiently hear the testimony
                  that may be presented; <emph>I</emph> will honestly and impartially give sentence,
                  according to the decision at which you may arrive. The trial will now
                  proceed."</p>
               <p>The witnesses were then examined. Ally was the first one sworn. He deposed to the
                  circumstances attending the whipping of Phyllis, and the assault on Selma; but, as
                  his evidence was altogether hearsay—he not being present on either occasion—it was
                  ruled out, as was also his account of the bribing of Mulock by the mistress.</p>
               <p>Three other negroes were then called, and they proved that Mulock aided in
                  dragging Selma to the whipping rack, and witnessed the beating; but they failed to
                  show that he was privy to or participated in the assault on his wife. Others were
                  examined, who saw parts of the two transactions, and then the testimony
                  closed.</p>
               <p>As the last witness left the stand, Gaston said:</p>
               <p>"I shall allow the prisoner the benefit of the final appeal. The attorney for the
                  people will now address the jury."</p>
               <p>The lawyer, a young man of no especial brilliancy or ability, rose, and, going
                  rapidly over the testimony, drew the conclusion from it that Mulock had instigated
                  the beating of both mother and daughter, and was therefore guilty of the assault
                  and the murder, and should accordingly be punished with death.</p>
               <p>The motive actuating him he held to be revenge on Preston, for having, long
                  previously, debauched his wife Phyllis. This passion, held in check during
                  Preston's lifetime by fear of the consequences which might follow its indulgence,
                  had broken out after his death, and wreaked itself on the two defenceless
                  women.</p>
               <p>The gentleman's reasoning was not very cogent, but, what he lacked in logic, he
                  made up in bitter denunciation of Mulock, who, according to his showing, was a
                  little blacker than the prime minister of the lower regions.</p>
               <p>As he took his seat, Larkin rose, and, addressing himself to both the jury and the
                  multitude, spoke, as near as I can recollect, as follows:</p>
               <p>"Gintlemen, this yere sort o' bis'ness is out uv my line. I'm not used ter
                  speechifyin', an' I may murder whot's called good English; but I'd a durned sight
                  ruther murder <emph>thet,</emph> then ter joodiciously, or ary other how murder a
                  human bein'; an' it's my private 'pinion <emph>ye'll</emph> murder Mulock, ef ye
                  bring him in guilty uv death.</p>
               <p>"A man hain't no right ter take human life, 'cept in self-defence. Even ef Mulock
                  wus so bad as this loryer feller tries ter make him out—but he hain't, 'cause
                  'tain't in natur for a man ter be wuss than th' devil himself—ye'd hev no right
                  ter stop his breath. Ye didn't guv it ter him; it doan't b'long ter ye, an' th'
                  lor doan't 'low ye ter take what hain't<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC6528-00000144"/>
                  your'n. Ef ye does, it's stealin', an' I knows thet none on the gintlemen uv the
                  jury ar so allfired mean as ter steal—'ticularly ter steal whot woan't be uv no
                  sort o' use ter 'em, nohow.</p>
               <p>"The loryer yere, hes spread hisself on Mulock's motive fur doin' this thing;
                  'sistin' thet fur seventeen yar he's ben a nussin' suthin—nussin' it as keerfully
                  as a mother nusses her chil'ren. Now, young 'uns gin'rally walks when they's 'bout
                  a yar old; but this one thet Mulock's ben a nussin' didn't git 'round till it wus
                  seventeen; an' I reckon a bantlin' thet karn't gwo alone afore it's thet age,
                  woan't never do much hurt ter nobody.</p>
               <p>"But these hain't th' raal p'ints uv th' case. I'm loryer 'nuff ter tell ye, ye
                  must gwo on th' evidence; an' thar hain't no evidence ter show thet Mulock hed ary
                  thing ter do with th' whippin' uv his wife; an' th' <emph>murder</emph> wus in
                  thet. He <emph>did</emph>—so th' nigs say, an' I reckon the' tells th' truth; an'
                  thet's whot nary loryer kin do, ef he try; so ye sees, a <emph>nig</emph> is
                  smarter nor a loryer. Wall, the nigs say he holped in whippin' th' white 'ooman;
                  an', as 'torney fur th' <emph>truth,</emph> gintlemen, which I'm gwine in fur
                  yere, I've got ter 'low it. He did aid an' 'bet, as the loryers call it, in thet,
                  an' thet proves him 'bout as mean as a white man ever gits ter be; an', 'sides
                  thet, he did <emph>sell</emph> har fur twenty dollars—a 'ooman thet even th'
                  'judge'—an' he <emph>ar a judge</emph> uv sech things—wus willin' ter pay
                  twenty-five hun'red fur; he <emph>did</emph> sell har fur <emph>twenty
                     dollars;</emph> an' thet proves him a fool! Now, fur bein' both mean an' a
                  fool, I 'low he orter be punished. But doan't ye kill him, gintlemen! Guv it ter
                  him 'cordin' ter his natur an' his merits. Just luk at him. Hev ye ever seed sech
                  a face, an' sech an eye as thet, in ary human bein'? Why, his eye ar jest like a
                  snake's; an' it's nat'ral, ye knows, fur snakes ter crawl; the' karn't do nuthin'
                  else, an' the' hain't ter blame fur it. No more ye karn't blame Mulock fur bein'
                  whot he ar. So guv him a coat uv tar—a ride on a rail—a duckin' in th'
                  pond—arything thet's 'cordin' ter his natur an' his merits; but doan't ye take
                  'way his <emph>life!</emph> Ef ye does thet, he's <emph>lost</emph>—LOST furever;
                  fur, I swar ter ye, his soul ar so small, thet ef it wus once out uv his body, th'
                  LORD himself couldn't find it, an' th' pore feller'd hev ter gwo wand'rin' 'round
                  with nary whar ter stay, an' nary friends, aither in heaven or t'other place! So
                  be easy with him, gintlemen. Guv him one more chance. Let him stay yere a spell
                  longer, fur yere his soul may grow. An' it <emph>kin</emph> grow! Everything in
                  natur grows—even skunks; an' who knows but Mulock may sprout out yit, an' grow ter
                  be a MAN!</p>
               <p>"I'se nuthin' more ter say, gintlemen, only this: Afore ye make up yer minds ter
                  bring Mulock in guilty uv death, jest put yerselfs inter his place, an' ax
                  yerselfs ef <emph>ye'd</emph> like ter hev a rope put 'round yer windpipe, as ye'd
                  put it 'round his'n! Ef ye wudn't, jest remember, 'tain't manly ter use ary nother
                  man in a how ye wudn't like ter be used yerselfs. I'm done."</p>
               <p>Larkin was frequently interrupted, during the delivery of this address, by the
                  loud shouts and laughter of the crowd; but, at its close, a perfect tornado of
                  applause swept over the multitude, and a hundred voices called out:</p>
               <p>"No; doan't ye hang him." "Give him one more chance." "Doan't gwo more'n the tar."
                  "Larkin's a loryer, shore."</p>
               <pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC6528-00000145"/>
               <p>Amid these and similar exclamations, the jury retired to the little grove of
                  liveoaks. In about fifteen minutes they returned to their seats.</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen of the jury," said Gaston, "have you agreed on your verdict?"</p>
               <p>"'Greed on one thing, Major Gaston," said the foreman, rising; "hain't on
                  t'other."</p>
               <p>"On what have you agreed?"</p>
               <p>"On whippin' th' young 'ooman."</p>
               <p>"What say you on that—guilty, or not guilty?"</p>
               <p>"Guilty."</p>
               <p>"And so say you all?"</p>
               <p>"Yas, Major."</p>
               <p>"How do you stand on the other charge?"</p>
               <p>"Four gwo in fur guilty; th' rest on us think Jake Larkin 'bout right as ter
                  hangin' on him."</p>
               <p>"It is not for Mr. Larkin, or you, to say what shall be done with the prisoner.
                  You are to decide whether he is or is not guilty of instigating the murder of his
                  wife. You must retire again, until you agree upon that."</p>
               <p>"'Twouldn't be uv no use, Major. We reckon he's mean 'nuff ter hev done it; but
                  whether he done it, or no, we gwo fur givin' him a chance ter live."</p>
               <p>"Ye're white men, I swar!" cried Larkin, springing from his seat, and grasping the
                  hands of several of the jurors in turn.</p>
               <p>"Take your seat, and observe order, Mr. Larkin," said the judge, smiling in spite
                  of himself.</p>
               <p>"All right," said Larkin; "ye're <emph>some</emph> as a judge, Major—'bout up ter
                  me as a loryer, an' thet's sayin' a heap; so jest be easy on th' pore devil.
                     <emph>Do,</emph> yer <emph>Honor!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Silence, sir!" said Gaston, laughing.</p>
               <p>Larkin took his seat, and the "judge" continued:</p>
               <p>"Prisoner, you have heard the verdict. Have you anything to say why sentence for
                  aiding in the assault on the white lady should not now be passed upon you?"</p>
               <p>"No, Major Gaston; I've nothin' ter say," said Mulock, dejectedly.</p>
               <p>Gaston continued: "You have been tried by a jury of your own selection. They are
                  unanimous in pronouncing you guilty of a cowardly and unwarrantable assault on a
                  white woman. They evidently deem you guilty of the worse crime of abetting the
                  murder of your own wife, and humane feelings only deter them from saying so. In
                  these circumstances, I feel it my duty to award you a more severe punishment than
                  I should have done had you been fully acquitted of the last charge. I shall
                  therefore sentence you to be coated with warm tar, ducked, in that condition,
                  three times in the pond, and then ridden on a rail to your shop at Trenton; and
                  may this example of public indignation lead you to a better life in future. Mr.
                  Larkin, I commission you to superintend the execution of the sentence."</p>
               <p>"No, ye doan't, Major—yer <emph>Honor,</emph> I mean! I'll stand by, an' see
                  Mulock hes far play; but I woan't do nary one's dirty work, I swar."</p>
               <p>"Well, who will volunteer for the duty?" said Gaston, appealing to the
                  audience.</p>
               <p>About a score of "natives" offered themselves; but, fixing his eye on a stout,
                  goodnatured-looking man, who had not volunteered, Gaston said:</p>
               <p>"Won't <emph>you</emph> do it, Mr. Moore?"</p>
               <pb n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6528-00000146"/>
               <p>"Yas, ter 'blige ye, Major, I will," replied the man.</p>
               <p>The "judge" then pronounced the court adjourned, and the crowd escorted Mulock and
                  the impromptu executioners to the site of the old distilleries. There an iron
                  kettle filled with tar was already simmering over a light-wood fire, and, being
                  divested of his borrowed plumage, Mulock was soon clad in a close-fitting suit of
                  black. He was about to be led to the pond, when Ally appeared on the ground.
                  Making his way through the crowd, he called out:</p>
               <p>"De young missus doan't want dis ting to gwo no fudder. She'll 'sider it a
                  'tic'lar favor ef de gemmen'll leff Mulock gwo."</p>
               <p>"We karn't let him off without consent uv the judge," said Mr. Moore.</p>
               <p>A messenger was sent for Gaston, who soon appeared, and consented that further
                  proceedings should be stopped. Mulock was at once released, and, coatless,
                  hatless, and all but trouser-less, he made his way through the hooting multitude,
                  and left the plantation, a blacker, if not a wiser and a better man.</p>
               <p>As we walked away from the "scene of execution," I said to the negro-trader:</p>
               <p>"Larkin, you should have been a lawyer; you managed that thing admirably."</p>
               <p>"Th' boys hed got thar blood up, an' I know'd I couldn't clar him. A man stands a
                  sorry chance in sech a crowd, ef they's raally bent on mischief."</p>
               <p>On the following morning the remainder of the negroes were purchased by Joe; and
                  in the afternoon I was on my way home.</p>

               <head type="sub">"DEAD! DEAD!"</head>
               <p>AS I was sitting in my library, late one evening, rather more than a month after
                  the events recorded in the last chapter, a hasty ring came at the street door.</p>
               <p>"Who can be calling so late?" said Kate. "Had <emph>you</emph> not better go?"</p>
               <p>Drawing on my boots, I went to the door. As I opened it, my hand was suddenly
                  seized, and a familiar voice exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"What about Selly? How is she?"</p>
               <p>"Lord bless you, Frank! is this you? How did you get here?"</p>
               <p>"How is Selma? Tell me!"</p>
               <p>"Safe and well—in Mobile, with Joe."</p>
               <p>"Thank GOD! thank GOD for <emph>that!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"How did you get here?"</p>
               <p>"By the Africa; she's below. I managed to get up by a small boat. I
                     <emph>couldn't</emph> wait."</p>
               <p>"Well, go up stairs. Your mother is in the library."</p>
               <p>After the first greeting had passed between Kate and the newcomer, he plied me
                  with questions in regard to Selma. I told him all, keeping nothing back.
                  Meanwhile, he walked the room, struggling with contending emotions—now joy, now<pb
                     n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6528-00000147"/> rage, now grief. He said nothing till I
                  mentioned Hallet's connection with the affair; then he spoke, and his words came
                  like the rushing of the tornado when it mows down the trees.</p>
               <p>"That is the <emph>one</emph> thing too much. I have held back till now. Now he
                     <emph>dies!</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Don't say that, my son!" exclaimed Kate. "Leave him to his conscience, and to
                  GOD. 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay, saith the LORD!'"</p>
               <p>"Vengeance is MINE! Don't talk to me, mother! I want no sermons now!"</p>
               <p>She looked at him sadly through her tears, and said:</p>
               <p>"Have I deserved this of <emph>you,</emph> Frank?"</p>
               <p>"Forgive me! forgive me, my mother!" and he buried his face in her dress, and
                  wept—wept as he never did when a child.</p>
               <p>A half hour passed, and no one spoke. Then he rose, and said to me:</p>
               <p>"When did you hear from her last?"</p>
               <p>"<emph>I</emph> had a letter yesterday; here it is," said Kate. "You see, she is
                  expecting you."</p>
               <p>He took it, and read it over slowly. All trace of his recent emotion had gone, and
                  on his face was an expression I had never seen there before. For the first time I
                  noticed his resemblance to his father!</p>
               <p>"When will you go?" continued Kate.</p>
               <p>"I don't know. I cannot, <emph>now.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"Why not <emph>now?</emph> What is there to prevent?"</p>
               <p>"I must go home first. I must see Cragin."</p>
               <p>"Cragin does not expect you for a fortnight," I said; "you can be back by that
                  time."</p>
               <p>"But I <emph>cannot</emph> go now!" and again he rose, and walked the room. "I'm
                  not ready yet. My mind isn't made up." After a pause, he added: "Would you have me
                  marry a slave—a woman of negro blood?"</p>
               <p>"I would have you do as your feelings and your conscience dictate."</p>
               <p>"You cannot love her, if you ask that question," said Kate, kindly, but
                  sorrowfully.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>do</emph> love her. I love her better than man ever loved woman; but can
                  I make her my <emph>wife?</emph> A negro wife! negro children!—ha! ha!" and he
                  clasped his hands above his head, and laughed that bitter, hollow laugh, which is
                  the sure echo of fearful misery within.</p>
               <p>"I cannot advise you, my son. You must act, <emph>now,</emph> on your own
                  judgment. I will only say, that through it all—when put at slave work—when bound
                  to the whipping stake—when she stood on the auction block for two long hours—she
                  was sustained <emph>only</emph> by trust in <emph>you.</emph> It is true—she told
                  me so; and if you forsake her now, it will"——</p>
               <p>"Kill her! I know it! I know it, O my GOD! my GOD!" and he groaned in agony—such
                  agony as I never before saw rend the spirit of mortal man.</p>

               <p>"I don't know. When he arrived, Frank was low-spirited and moody, but very glad to
                  see me. I brought him up here at once. He seemed overjoyed at meeting Selma, and
                  would not let her go out of his sight for a moment. Still he appeared excited and
                  uneasy, till I met him at the supper table. Then he was more like himself. I went
                  with them into the parlor, and there conversed with Frank on business matters for
                  fully two hours. We planned some shipments to Europe, and talked over sending
                  Larkin to Texas to buy cattle for the New Orleans market. We agreed on it. I was
                  to provide means, by keeping ninety-day drafts afloat on them (I'm short, just
                  now, having paid out so much for the negroes), and they and I were to divide the
                  profits with Larkin. Frank's head was as clear as a bell. I had no idea he was so
                  good a business man. Well, about eight o'clock I left them together, and, a little
                  after nine, went to bed. Selma's room is next to mine, and it couldn't have been
                  later than eleven when I heard her go to it.</p>
               <p>"The next morning she didn't come down as usual. I had a servant call her. She
                  made no reply; but I thought nothing ing of it, till half an hour afterward. Then
                  I went up myself. I rapped repeatedly, but got no answer. Becoming alarmed, I sent
                  a servant for an axe. Frank brought it up, and I battered down the door, and found
                  her lying on the bed, dressed as usual, a half-empty bottle of laudanum beside
                  her—DEAD!"</p>
               <p>"My GOD! And Frank made her do it!"</p>
               <p>"Don't say that. If he <emph>did,</emph> he is fearfully punished; he has suffered
                  terribly."</p>
               <p>"Where is he?"</p>
               <p>"In the front room. He has raved incessantly. At first four men couldn't hold him.
                  Somehow, he got a knife, and cut himself badly. I got it away, but he threw me in
                  the struggle, and nearly throttled me. He's calmer now, and I've had him untied;
                  but old Joe has to stay with him night and day. Nobody else can manage him."</p>
               <p>We went into the room. Frank sat in one corner, pale, haggard, only the shadow of
                  what he was but ten days before. His head was leaning against the wall, and he was
                  gazing out of the window.</p>
               <p>As I entered, "Boss Joe" came forward and greeted me, but neither of us spoke.
                  Approaching Frank, I laid my hand on his shoulder.</p>
               <p>"My boy, I have come for you."</p>
               <p>He rose, and looked at me, a wild glare in his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Well, it's high time; I've waited long enough. I'm ready. I don't deny it—I
                  killed her. Make short work of it. I'd have saved you the trouble, but this
                  infernal nigger told me I'd go to hell if I did it; and I know <emph>she</emph>
                  isn't there. I want to see her again! I want her to forgive me—to forgive me! Oh!
                  oh!" and he sank into his chair, and moaned piteously.</p>
               <pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC6528-00000149"/>
               <p>"He tinks you'm de sheriff, massa Kirke," whispered Joe.</p>
               <p>I leaned over him. The tears started from my eyes, and fell on his face, as I
                  said:</p>
               <p>"You <emph>will</emph> see her again. She does pity and forgive you."</p>
               <p>He sprang from his seat, and clutched my hands. "Do you believe it? Joe says so;
                  but Joe is a nigger—and what does a <emph>nigger</emph> know?" Then, putting his
                  mouth close to my ear, he added: "They told me <emph>she</emph> was one. It was
                  false—false as hell; but"—and he threw his arms above his head, and groaned the
                  rest—"but it made me say it. O my GOD! my GOD! it made me say it!" His head sank
                  on my shoulder, and again he gave out those piteous moans.</p>
               <p>"Have comfort, my boy. I know she loves and pities you <emph>now!</emph>"</p>
               <p>He looked up. "Say that again! For the love of God say that again!"</p>
               <p>"It is so! As sure as there's another life, it is so!"</p>
               <p>He gazed at me fixedly for a few moments—then again commenced pacing the room.</p>
               <p>"I wish I could believe it. But <emph>you</emph> ought to know; you look like a
                  parson. You are a parson, aren't you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I'm a parson. I <emph>know</emph> it is so!"</p>
               <p>"Well, tell them to hurry up. I want to go to her at once—<emph>now!</emph> I
                  can't live another week in this way. Tell them to hurry up."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will; and you'll go with me to-morrow, won't you?"</p>
               <p>He gave me, again, a long, scrutinizing look. "You're the sheriff, aren't
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I'll go with you. But you must promise to make short work of it."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes; I'll promise that. But lie down, now, and be quiet. I'll be ready for
                  you in the morning."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, I'll try to be patient;" and he threw himself on the small cot in one
                  corner of the room. "But you'll let old Joe stay with me, won't you?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; certainly."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, sir. Joe, bring me a cigar—that's a good fellow. You're the decentest
                  nigger I ever knew. It's an awful pity you're black. They told me <emph>she</emph>
                  was black. 'Twas an infernal lie! I know it, for I saw her last night, and she was
                  whiter than any woman you ever saw. Black! Pshaw! nobody but the devil's black;
                  and <emph>she</emph>—she's an angel NOW!"</p>
               <p>As we passed out of the room, Joe said to me:</p>
               <p>"Would you like to see Selma?"</p>
               <p>"Have you kept her?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; I knew you would want to see her."</p>
               <p>He led the way up stairs to her chamber. In a plain, air-tight coffin, lay all
                  that was left of the slave girl. Her hands were crossed on her bosom; her long,
                  glossy, brown hair fell over her neck, and on her face was the look the angels
                  wear. She seemed not dead, but sleeping!</p>
               <p>As I turned away, Joe took my hand, and, while a nervous spasm passed over his
                  face, he said:</p>
               <p>"She was all that I had; but I—I forgive him!"</p>
               <p>"And for that, GOD will forgive <emph>you!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The next day we buried her.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>"Boss Joe" accompanied us to the North. We reached<pb n="298-299"
                     xml:id="VAC6528-00000150"/> home just after dark. When we entered the parlor,
                  Frank gazed around with an eager, curious look, as if some familiar scene was
                  returning to him. In a few moments Kate entered. She rushed to him, and clasped
                  him in her arms. He took her face between his two hands, and looked long and
                  earnestly at her. Then, dropping his head on her shoulder, and bursting into
                  tears, he cried:</p>
               <p>"My mother! O my mother!"</p>
               <p>He had awoke. The terrible dream was over. From that moment he was himself.</p>
               <p>What passed between him and Selma on that fatal evening, I never knew. He has not
                  spoken her name since that night.</p>

               <head type="sub">CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>MRS. DAWSEY lay at the mansion, under guard, for several weeks. When finally able
                  to be moved, she was conveyed to the "furnished apartments" bespoken for her by
                  Joe. Her husband, after a short confinement in jail, was set at liberty, and then
                  made strenuous efforts to effect his wife's release on bail. He did not succeed.
                  Public feeling ran very high against her; and that, probably more than the fact
                  that she was charged with an unbailable crime, operated to prolong her residence
                  at the public boarding house kept for runaway slaves and common felons at
                  Trenton.</p>
               <p>At the next session of the "county court," after an imprisonment of four months,
                  she was arraigned for trial. Owing to the death of Selma, Mulock was the only
                  white witness against her. He told a straightforward story, the most rigid
                  cross-examination not swerving him from it, and deposed to Dawsey's having
                  attempted to bribe him to go away. His evidence was conclusive as to the
                  prisoner's guilt; but her counsel, an able man, made so damaging an assault on his
                  personal character, that the jury disagreed. Mrs. Dawsey was then remanded to jail
                  to await a new trial, at the next sitting of the court.</p>
               <pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC6528-00000151"/>
               <p>Shortly after the trial, Mulock suddenly disappeared, Hearing of it, and
                  suspecting he had been spirited away by Dawsey, Joseph Preston went to Trenton,
                  and, procuring a judge's order for Mulock's arrest as an absconding witness,
                  caused a thorough search to be made for him in Jones and the adjoining counties.
                  He himself visited Chalk Level, in Harnett County, and there found him, living
                  again with his white wife. That lady had previously won and lost a second spouse,
                  but, it appeared, was then in such straits for another husband, that she was
                  willing to take up with her own cast-off household furniture. Whether a new
                  marriage ceremony was performed, or not, I never learned; but I have been reliably
                  informed that Mulock complained bitterly of his wife for having defrauded him of
                  twenty-five of the fifty dollars she had agreed to pay as consideration for his
                  again sharing her "bed and board."</p>
               <p>Mulock admitted having received four hundred dollars from Dawsey for absenting
                  himself, and gave as excuse for accepting the bribe, his conviction that Mrs.
                  Dawsey could not be found guilty on <emph>his</emph> testimony. After his arrest
                  he was confined in the same jail with the "retired" schoolmistress.</p>
               <p>The second trial was approaching; but, late on the night preceding the sitting of
                  the court, the jailer's house—which adjoined and communicated with the prison—was
                  forcibly entered by four armed men disguised as negroes. They bound and gagged the
                  jailer, his wife, and two female servants, and, seizing the keys, entered the
                  jail, and carried Mulock off by force. The keeper heard a desperate struggle, and
                  it was supposed Mulock was foully dealt by. The footprints of four men were the
                  next morning detected leading to a spot on the bank of the river, where a boat
                  appeared to have been moored; but there all traces were lost, and the overseer's
                  fate is still shrouded in mystery.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dawsey, whose cell adjoined Mulock's, was not disturbed, but public suspicion
                  connected her husband with the affair. There was, however, no evidence against
                  him, and he went "unwhipt of justice."</p>
               <p>The lady was arraigned for trial on the following day, but, no witnesses appearing
                  against her, she was—after a tedious confinement of ten months—set at liberty.
                  Thus, at last, she achieved "a plantation and a rich planter;" but her darling
                  object in life—to lead and shine in society, for which her education and character
                  peculiarly fitted her—she missed. With the exception of her brutal husband, an
                  ignorant overseer, and a superannuated "schulemarm," imported from the North, she
                  has no associates. Society has built up a wall about her, and, with the brand of
                  Cain on her forehead, she is going through the world.</p>
               <p>Larkin, after breaking off his connection with his "respectable" associates,
                  descended from trading in human cattle, to trafficking in fourfooted beasts and
                  all manner of horned animals. Joe offered him an interest in his business; but the
                  negro-trader had too long led a roving life to be content with the dull routine of
                  regular business. Young Preston, and Cragin, Mandell &amp; Co., stipulating for a
                  half of his profits, then furnished him a capital of fifty thousand dollars; and
                  with that he embarked largely in "cattle driving." He bought in Texas, and sold in
                  New Orleans, and did a profitable business until the breaking out of the
                  rebellion. Since that event he has been an officer in the confederate army.</p>
               <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6528-00000152"/>
               <p>Frank remained at my house for a fortnight after his return from the South, and
                  then, apparently restored, went to Boston. Business had grown distasteful to him,
                  and he sought a dissolution with Cragin; but the latter prevailed on him to remain
                  in the firm, and go to Europe. He continued there until news reached Liverpool of
                  the fall of Fort Sumter, when he took the first steamer for home. Arriving in
                  Boston, he at once effected a dissolution with Cragin, and then came on to New
                  York to make his "mother" a short visit prior to entering the army. He expressed
                  the intention of enlisting as a private, and I tried to dissuade him from it, by
                  representing how readily he could raise a company in Boston, and go as an
                  officer.</p>
               <p>"No," he replied; "I know nothing of tactics. I am unfit to lead; I can only fire
                  a musket. With one on my shoulder, I will go, and sell my life as dearly as I
                  can."</p>
               <p>On the 18th of May, 1861, he left New York, as a private in Duryee's Zouaves (5th
                  Regiment N.Y.V.), and on the 10th of June following, while fighting bravely by the
                  side of York, Winthrop, and Greble, at Big Bethel, fell, badly wounded by a musket
                  ball.</p>
               <p>When he was fit to be moved, I had him conveyed home. His recovery was slow, but,
                  as soon as he was able to go out, and still suffering from his wound, he went on
                  to Boston to render Cragin some assistance in his business. General Butler's
                  expedition was then fitting out for New Orleans. Weak as he was, Frank raised a
                  company of Boston boys for it, and went off as their captain.</p>
               <p>He was present at the bombardment and capture of New Orleans; but, growing weary
                  of the inactivity which followed those events, and hearing of the stirring times
                  in Tennessee, he resolved to resign his commission, and seek service in the
                  Western army.</p>
               <p>After his resignation had been accepted, and on the eve of his departure for the
                  North, as he was returning one night to his lodgings, he was accosted by a woman
                  of the street. Her face seemed familiar, and he asked her name. She answered,
                  "Rosey Preston." He went with her to her home—a miserable room in the third story
                  of a tumbledown shanty in Chartres street—and there found her child, a bright
                  little fellow of about six years. With them, on the following day, he sailed for
                  the North.</p>
               <p>Arriving here, he settled on Rosey the income of a small sum, and procured her
                  apartments in a modest tenement house in East Thirtieth street. There she now
                  works at her needle, and the little boy attends a public school.</p>
               <p>Within the week of Frank's arrival, and when he was about setting out for the
                  West, I was surprised, one morning, by Ally's appearance in my office. Newbern had
                  fallen, and he had made his way, with his mother, into the Union lines, and, after
                  a good deal of difficulty, had secured passage on a return transport to New York.
                  I provided employment for Dinah, but Ally insisted on going into the war with
                  Frank. He went as his servant, but fought at his side at Lawrenceburgh, Dog Walk,
                  Chaplin Hills, and Frankfort, and in three of those engagements was wounded. His
                  bones now whiten the plains of Tennessee. Rosey he never met, and never
                  forgave.</p>
               <p>Frank was with that small body of regulars at Murfrees-borough, who, on the 31st
                  of December, checked the advance<pb n="304-305" xml:id="VAC6528-00000153"/> of
                  Hardee's corps after McCook's division had been driven from the field, and saved
                  the day. He was wounded in the arm, early in the morning, but kept the field, and
                  joined in that heroic movement when fifteen hundred men marched through an open
                  field, and charged upon a body of ten thousand posted in a dense grove of cedars.
                  Six hundred and forty-six of the brave band were left on the field. Frank was
                  among them. A Belgian ball pierced his left side, and came out at his back. He saw
                  and recognized the man who gave the wound, and, raising himself on his elbow,
                  fired a last shot. It did its work. The rebel lies buried on the spot where Frank
                  fell.</p>
               <p>The telegram which informed me of this event, said: "He is desperately wounded,
                  but may survive." He is now at home, slowly recovering. What he saw and did while
                  serving in Kentucky and Tennessee, I may at some future time narrate to the
                  reader.</p>
               <p>In relating actual events, a writer cannot in all cases visit artistic justice on
                  every one of his characters; for, in real life, retribution does not always appear
                  to follow crime. But, whatever <emph>appearances</emph> may be, who is there that
                  does not feel that virtue is ever its own reward, and vice its own punishment? and
                  what one of my readers would exchange "a quiet conscience, void of offence toward
                  God and toward man," for the princely fortune of John Hallet—who is still the
                  great merchant, the "exemplary citizen," the "honest man"?</p>

               <head>LAST WORDS.</head>
               <p>WHOEVER comes before the American public in a time of great <emph>deeds,</emph>
                  like this, with mere <emph>words,</emph> should have no idle story to tell. He
                  should have something to say; some fact to relate, or truth to communicate, which
                  may awaken his countrymen to a true estimate of their interests, or a true sense
                  of their duties.</p>
               <p>The writer of this book <emph>has</emph> something to say; some facts to relate
                  which have not been told; some truths to communicate about Southern life and
                  society, which the public ought to know. Some of these facts, gathered during
                  sixteen years of intimate business and social intercourse with the planters and
                  merchants of the South, he has endeavored to embody in this volume.</p>
               <p>He has woven them into a story, but they are nevertheless facts, and all of them,
                  excepting one, occurred under his own observation. That one—the death of old
                  Jack—was communicated to him, as a fact, by his friend, Dr. W. H. Holcombe, of
                  Waterproof, La., now an officer in the confederate army.</p>
               <p>The author does not mean to say that his story is true as a connected whole. It is
                  not. In it, persons are brought into intimate relations who never had any
                  connection in life; events are grouped together which happened at widely
                     different<pb n="306-307" xml:id="VAC6528-00000154"/> ent times; and events are
                  described as occurring in the vicinity of Newbern—the slave auction, for
                  instance—parts of which occurred in Alabama, parts in Georgia, and parts in
                  Louisiana. But all of the characters he has described <emph>have</emph> lived, and
                  all of the events he has related <emph>have</emph> transpired. He would not,
                  however, have the reader believe that all which he says of himself is true. Some
                  of it is; some of it is not. The story needed something to revolve around; and, as
                  he commenced by using the personal pronoun, he continued its use, even in
                  parts—like the scenes with Hallet—wherein the <emph>I</emph> stands for altogether
                  another individual.</p>
               <p>The real name of the character whom he has called Selma (he can state this without
                  wounding the feelings of any one, as none of her relatives are now living), was
                  Selma Winchester. She was educated at Cambridge, Mass., was a slave, and died of a
                  broken heart shortly after being put at menial labor in her mother-in-law's
                  kitchen. Her character and appearance, even the costume she wore on the occasion
                  of her visit to the opera—a scene which many residents of Boston and vicinity will
                  remember—is attempted to be described literally. She was not the daughter of
                  Preston; her father was a very different sort of man. Nor was she sold at auction.
                  The young woman who was engaged to "Frank Mandell," and bought at that sale by her
                  brother, was equally as accomplished, though not so beautiful as Selma. She
                  committed suicide, as herein related. The author has blended the two characters
                  into one, but in no particular has he departed from the truth.</p>
               <p>The gentleman called Preston in the story was for many years one of the writer's
                  correspondents. He had two wives, such as are described, and was the father of Joe
                  and Rosey, whose connection was as is related. He was <emph>not</emph> the owner
                  of "Boss Joe." The original of that character belonged (and the writer trusts
                  still belongs) to a cotton planter in Alabama. He managed two hundred hands, and
                  in no respect is he overdrawn in the story. His sermon is repeated from memory,
                  and is far inferior to the original. He was a Swedenborgian, and one of the finest
                  natural orators the writer ever listened to. Old Deborah was his mother, and died
                  comfortably in her bed. The old woman who fell dead on the auction block, was the
                  nurse of the young woman who was engaged to Frank. The excitement of the scene,
                  and her anxiety for her "young missus," killed her.</p>
               <p>Larkin's real name is Jacob Larkin. He was at one time connected with the person
                  called Hallet. He was well known in many parts of the South, and relinquished
                  negro-trading under circumstances similar to those related in the story. He is
                  now—though a rebel in arms against his country—an honest man.</p>
               <p>John Hallet, the writer is sorry to say, is also a real character; but he does not
                  disgrace the good city of Boston. He operates on a wider field.</p>
               <milestone n="*   *   *   *   *   *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>That most excellent woman, Mrs. C.M. Kirkland, said to the author, shortly after
                  the fall of Fort Sumter: "If you cannot shoulder a musket, you can blow a bugle."
                  In this, and in a previous book, he has attempted to blow that bugle. If the
                  blasts are not as musical as they might be, he has no apology to make for them.
                  They have, at least, the ring of <emph>truth;</emph> and whether they please the
                  public ear, or not, the author is<pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6528-00000155"/>
                  satisfied. It is no unimportant part of the great war for freedom to know the
                  social condition of our enemies, and the actual influence of the institution which
                  inspires such hatred for us. Knowing the truth, we can better determine whether it
                  should form a part of our policy to oppose or sustain that institution.</p>
