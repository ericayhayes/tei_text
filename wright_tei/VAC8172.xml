BOILEAU.&#xD;
THE large telling carriage of Col. Clarkson, containing&#xD;
himself and family, with the usual retinue of servants, etc.,&#xD;
was moving slowly along the bank of the Mississippi River,&#xD;
near what is called the "Bend," in the State of Mississippi,&#xD;
early in autumn, when "little Agnes," as she was called, a&#xD;
girl of some twelve or thirteen summers, who had for some&#xD;
time been leaning her head pensively out of the carriage&#xD;
window, started up and exclaimed:&#xD;
"Oh, Ma! See that old man with his long white hair !"&#xD;
"My !" exclaimed Mrs. Clarkson, "Do look, husband !"&#xD;
He did look, and beheld by far the most remarkable per-&#xD;
sonage he had ever seen~ An old man, above the 'r~te4ium&#xD;
height, with strongly marked features, a broad ~he~thut not&#xD;
deep; a square, high forehead; high cheek b6nei~., firni1y~set&#xD;
lips, hair as white as cotton, and falling down his back nearly&#xD;
to his waist; a little bent in figure, from habit rather than&#xD;
from infirmity; his dress neat and becoming age and gravity;&#xD;

his hands crossed behind him; w~dking up and down the river&#xD;
bank with firm and measured st ~p, casting now and then a&#xD;
Aance toward the stream, as if expecting to see some&#xD;
~ cherished ~object emerge from tl~ e muddy and angry waters.&#xD;
fhe whiteness of his long locks, and the deep lines in his&#xD;
face, gave him the appearance of extreme age; but the firm-&#xD;
ness of his step an~ a certain air of resolution about him,&#xD;
satisfied the observer that time alone had not so frosted his&#xD;
hair, nor made the lines in his face. There was an expres-&#xD;
sion of melancholy, a majesty of grief about the stern, vener-&#xD;
able old man, that awed one to silence and respect. Bob, the&#xD;
carriage-driver, upon seeing him, dropped the reins, and gazed&#xD;
as if struck by a spell. All looked in silence until a tu:cn in&#xD;
the road hid the sad, solemn figure from their view, when&#xD;
they sighed, turned and looked each other inquiringly in the&#xD;
face, as much a~ to say, "What can it mean? Who can it&#xD;
be ?" Thus impressed and wondering, they soon drove up&#xD;
to Col. Clarkson's plantation, the end and aim of their&#xD;
journey. The Colonel had been there frequently before, but&#xD;
always by water, and remained but a few days at a time.&#xD;
This was the first visit his family had made to the place. By&#xD;
agreement with several of the proprietors of neighboring plan-&#xD;
tations, whose families determine4 to spend the fall and a&#xD;
portion of the ensuing winter on their places, Col. Clarkson's&#xD;
family determined upon the same thing, and had gone up for&#xD;
that purpose.&#xD;
The family residence, if a rough weather-boarded house,&#xD;
with board roof, unplanned floors, a wide passage, and long&#xD;
gallery, and some unfinished and unfurnished rooms, perched&#xD;
upon small cypress pillars, could be called a residence, was&#xD;
pleasantly situated at a convenient' distance from the river,&#xD;
and distinguishable from the two long rows of whitewashed&#xD;
negro cabins, similarly perched upon cypress pillars, and&#xD;
shaded by double rows of ?China trees, by its size, being some-&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
thing larger, and hence called by the ~egroes the "big hon~e,"&#xD;
a name common among negroes for the family residence. The&#xD;
prospect for comfort was unpromising enough; but as there&#xD;
were two or three plain carpenters among the negroes on the&#xD;
plantation, and the Colonel had recently~ purchased in New&#xD;
Orleans, the great negro mart for the Southwest, several&#xD;
"hands," and ordered them shipped to the plantation to aid&#xD;
in picking out the cotton, thus enabling the overseer to spare&#xD;
the carpenters from the field, plans were soon made for en-&#xD;
larging and improving the premises, so as to make them not&#xD;
only inhabitable, but every way convenient and comfortable.&#xD;
Before leaving his residence in Bluff City, the Colonel had&#xD;
secured the services of a good house carpenter to superintend&#xD;
the improvements on his place, and found him there waiting.&#xD;
Material also had been supplied, and we may here remark&#xD;
that all that willing hands and strong arms could do, and&#xD;
good taste and an eye to substantial comfort suggest, and&#xD;
wealth command, to relieve the forbidding aspect, was soon&#xD;
done and furnished.&#xD;
In the evening, Mr. Blake, the overseer, a gentleman some-&#xD;
thing above his class in education and general information,&#xD;
called to see the family, and give an account to Clarkson of&#xD;
affairs on the plantation. He was inquired of in re~tion&#xD;
to the gray-haired old man whQse appearance had so im-&#xD;
pressed them in the afternoon.&#xD;
"All that is known of him," he said, "is, that the first&#xD;
settlers found him here some thirty years ago, when this&#xD;
entire region was a forest of cane and tangled undergrowth,&#xD;
except his little clearing. He looked much then as now,&#xD;
save that his hair was not perhaps quite so white* his&#xD;
manners and habits were the same, walking up and down 1~he-&#xD;
river bank, in the bent manner you saw him this afternoon,&#xD;
at all seasons, and sometimes in all sorts of weather. He'&#xD;
has two old negroes, a man and Woman. They are as silent&#xD;

&#xD;
and uniform in their habits as he. They are all thought to&#xD;
be deaf and dumb, as no one ever heard either of them&#xD;
speak; nor has the old man ever been known, by look or&#xD;
gesture, to recognize the presence of any one. Wood-&#xD;
choppers and other earlier settlers used to make advances to&#xD;
him-ask him for shelter, water, a meal, direction, or sunie-&#xD;
thing of the kind, but received no reply from him of any&#xD;
sort, either in word or manner. His air of melancholy and&#xD;
dignity repels and rebukes all impertinent inquiry and&#xD;
curiosity; and his evident desire to be alone, unknowing and&#xD;
unknown, and the belief that he is nursing some great grief,&#xD;
saves him from interruption by the white population, and a&#xD;
feeling of superstition secures him from all disturbance from&#xD;
the blacks. Who he is, when he came here, where he came&#xD;
from, and why he deports himself thus, no one knows; and&#xD;
he either cannot o~ does not care to tell. A thousand sur-&#xD;
mises are of course mad as to the cause of his singular&#xD;
deportment; but bcyon what I have said, nothing is&#xD;
definitely known, save th t he is called the 'hERMIT.'"&#xD;
"Have you ever visited his house ?"&#xD;
"Often."&#xD;
"And you think he and all are deaf?"&#xD;
"t do not think so m ~self. That is the general belief;&#xD;
however. I can hardly g ye a reason why I do not think so,&#xD;
unless it be the air of intelligence about him, and the speak~&#xD;
'ing appearance of every thing about the house. I think&#xD;
you will agree with me, should you ever visit him."&#xD;
"' Do you think he would take it unkindly, were I to visit&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
"I do not; though he will not notice you in any way, and&#xD;
act exactly as if you' were not there."&#xD;
"Strange being, certainly I"&#xD;
"Will he let me go ?" asked Agnes, a deeply interested&#xD;
listener to all that had been said.&#xD;

&#xD;
"0, yes," said Mr. Blake; "my children go there occa-&#xD;
sionally."&#xD;
For several days Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson were so absorbed&#xD;
in the mysteries of building, improving, repairing, and clean-&#xD;
ing up, about the house and grounds, as to lose all thought of&#xD;
the Hermit. Not so, however, with Agnes. He moved&#xD;
strangely through her dreams during the night, and was the&#xD;
first in her thoughts in the morning. As soon as breakfast&#xD;
was over, she took her little maid and started in search of&#xD;
him. There he was, just as upon the day previous, with his&#xD;
hands behind him, walking up and down the river. She&#xD;
seemed singularly fascinated. As she made the turn in the&#xD;
road, she started, upon seeing him, like a timid fawn, with&#xD;
the exclamation, "There !" in a suppressed whisper. She&#xD;
stood gazing at him for a moment; then advanced a few steps,&#xD;
stopped and gazed, with her finger to her mouth, and eyes&#xD;
opened wide; started forward again, and so continued, until&#xD;
within a short distance of the path worn by him in his&#xD;
promenade, at no time taking her eyes from him. Her&#xD;
motions were involuntary, guided as by a charm, her head&#xD;
a little b~nt to one side, and she touched the ground lightly,&#xD;
ready, like the fawn, to bound away at the least alarm, her&#xD;
eyes following him up and down, unconsciously receding as&#xD;
he approached, and advancing as he receded, as if by some&#xD;
physical force. For some time he was ignort~nt of her pre-&#xD;
sence; but she finally crossed his path, and was standing&#xD;
between him and the river; and, raising his eyes to look, as&#xD;
was his habit, over the stream, he encountered her fixed,&#xD;
charmed gaze; and a vision of loveliness, seraphic beauty&#xD;
such as is rarely seen in this rugged world, thrilled him' like&#xD;
an electric shock. Agnes was lovely beyond the power of&#xD;
pen .to write. It was not merely the exquisitely chiselled form,&#xD;
lithe and perfect in all its parts, the clear white skin, softly~&#xD;
pencilled Grecian profile, dark brown hair, flowing in light&#xD;

&#xD;
wavy curls upon shoulders white and pellucid as alabaster,&#xD;
and splendid blazing hazel eye, but the soul that shone&#xD;
through, giving life, animation, and vocality to all. It was&#xD;
a vision such as one sees in, dreams, sometime~ in pictures,&#xD;
but rarely in real life. Such a being is at rare intervals lent&#xD;
to earth by a kind Providence, to show how far his handi-&#xD;
work exceeds in perfection the utmost stretch of genius. It&#xD;
lasted but a moment; for as soon as she recovered from the&#xD;
surprise the consciousness of being observed occasioned, she&#xD;
bounded off like an t~ntelope, reached the main road, where&#xD;
her timid maid awaited her, and, without a word, walked&#xD;
briskly home. Her visits were repeated daily; and although&#xD;
the Hermit seemed unaware of her presence, he was not;&#xD;
for when by any chance she failed to take her stand beside&#xD;
his path, his glances were toward th~ turn in the road, rather&#xD;
than the river. Her interest in hini increased, and by de-&#xD;
grees she grew less shy, more confiding, and would involun-&#xD;
tarily follow a few steps, as he passed to and fro. One&#xD;
morning he was more melancholy than usual-appeared&#xD;
depressed in spirits-and she drew closer to him, walked&#xD;
near him, looking ~ristfully into his face. As she looked, a&#xD;
big tear gathered in the eye of the stern, hard old man,&#xD;
rounded, trembled upon the lid, rolled slowly down the wrinkled&#xD;
face, and dropped in the dust. Little Agnes could stand it&#xD;
no longer, and sprang up, seized the old man around the&#xD;
neck, buried h ~r face in his bosom, and wept as if her heart&#xD;
would run to tea~s. He folded her close to his bosom, and said:&#xD;
"What is the matter, my angel child ?" The first wom~ds&#xD;
he had spoken for thirty years.&#xD;
"0, you are so sad !" And she nestled closer to him.&#xD;
"Do you indeed care for the sorrows of an old man, a&#xD;
waif broken an cast away by cruel fortune? an aged hem~&#xD;
lock, so old and~ repulsive that the birds will not build nor&#xD;
perch upon it ?" And the tears rained from his eyes; the&#xD;
&#xD;
J&#xD;
&#xD;
first he had shed since boyhood~ He soon recovered, and,&#xD;
suppressing his emotion, put her gently down, took her hand,&#xD;
and led her along in his walk. From that time, a perfect&#xD;
understanding existed between them, and each day she&#xD;
placed herself beside him, her hand in his, or holding his&#xD;
with both hers, promenaded up and down with him until her&#xD;
little feet would grow weary, neither speaking a word. For&#xD;
her sake he would often change his walk, until it became a&#xD;
desultory ramble about the river bank and the woods near,&#xD;
o'atherino' at tii~ies wild fruit and berries. By deo'rees his&#xD;
0                                     0&#xD;
passion took an entirely new direction; he gave up his old&#xD;
beaten path, and followed and watched little Agnes like some&#xD;
guardian spirit.&#xD;
It was nut long before this simple and beautiful attachment&#xD;
attracted the attention of the ever-careful and fond parents;&#xD;
but knowing it to be safe and innocent, from what they could&#xD;
see and learn of his character, and seeing that it gave pleasure&#xD;
to the solitary old man as well as to their dearly loved and&#xD;
willingly obedient child, it was given full scope. Agnes's&#xD;
chamber, as the house progressed toward completion, was at&#xD;
the northern end of the building, near which ran the road&#xD;
that lcd back into the swamp; and often at night, when the&#xD;
household were all wrapped in sleep, the measured tramp of&#xD;
the hermit might be heard, as he walked to and fro near her&#xD;
window, like some faithful sentinel keeping watch at his post.&#xD;
She had, of course, explained to her parents how the good.&#xD;
understanding between herself and the hermit had begun and&#xD;
progressed, and received their open permission to cultivate&#xD;
his friendship, and do what her young, truthful heart might&#xD;
prompt, to win him from care and thought.&#xD;
To some it may appear strange how such a touchingly&#xD;
beautiful attachment could exist between so old and stern a&#xD;
man, and such a soft, trusting, lovely child. It was from a&#xD;
peculiar refinement of sentiment and spirit, an exquisite polish&#xD;
&#xD;

and delicacy of soul common to both. This polish and refine-&#xD;
ment of spirit is not unfrequently met with in natures out-&#xD;
wardly coarse and rugged, and, like diamonds, shows alit the&#xD;
brighter for the coarse setting. It is a spark of the divinity;&#xD;
the same that Brabantio's "fair daughter" saw in the Moor,&#xD;
and made her "incur the general mock," in shunning the&#xD;
"curled darlings of the nation" and runto his "sooty bosom;"&#xD;
and not "spells and medicines bought of mountebanks," as&#xD;
her incredulous father thought. Agnes was fond of other&#xD;
children, loved to entertain them, and they were fond of her,&#xD;
but she never seemed to be a part of them. She liked their&#xD;
childish sports and pastimes, but preferred to look rather&#xD;
than partake in them; they were not an obj ect with her, and&#xD;
never recalled after they had passed. She never thought of&#xD;
herself: though beautiful, and always tastily dressed, she&#xD;
seemed not to know or to bestow a thought upon it. She&#xD;
would sit and watch the far-off clouds break and form them-&#xD;
selves into a thousand fantastic shapes; count the stars as&#xD;
they came out one by one as twilight deepened, and when&#xD;
surprised in one of these moods, and asked, she could not ex-&#xD;
plain or give expression to the sentiment of the grand and&#xD;
infinite that filled her soul; but she could feel it; its impress&#xD;
was, there. In the Hermit, without understanding how, she&#xD;
found a spirit kindred to hers. To be sure, he did not sit and&#xD;
gaze in wonder at the creamy clouds that gathered and&#xD;
banked themselves up ~nountain-like in the summer heavens,&#xD;
nor watch the large sand-hill crane as, at the approacl:i of&#xD;
spring, it stretched its long beak northward, and winged its&#xD;
way towards the pole, calling by its musical cruke its feathered&#xD;
mates; and, when lost in the far-distant blue, she did not see&#xD;
him sit down and wonder when the journey would end and&#xD;
why it made it; and passing thence, wonder why it was made&#xD;
at all? But while she did not see this, she saw him buried&#xD;
in thought, and whether like the crane it was lost in the way-&#xD;

off blue, or was far up beyond the stars, or was down, d o~vn,&#xD;
deep beneath the turbid wave, holding communion with some&#xD;
one with wet locks lying there, she could not tell; but as she&#xD;
looked into his sad face, and he all indifferent to the world&#xD;
around, she was lost, as when watching the flight of the crane,&#xD;
counting the stars, or measuring the great infinity beyond.&#xD;
Tie too found in the sweet child that stared in his face and&#xD;
shared his solitude, a thoughtful spirit like his own, and a&#xD;
common feeling and sympathy wove a tie strong as life be~&#xD;

CHAPTEII IT.&#xD;
"The tankard foams, and the strong table groans&#xD;
Beneath the smoking sirloin stretched immense&#xD;
From side to side, in which, with desperate knife,&#xD;
They deep incisions make."&#xD;
THE portion of country in which Col. Clarkson's plantation&#xD;
was situated, was set tied by large, wealthy planters, most; of&#xD;
whom, as before stated, were spending the fidi there with&#xD;
their families, thus forming good society, both tale and&#xD;
female. House room, such as it wa~, was ample upon each&#xD;
plantation. Some were furnished wi~h fine buildings, and all&#xD;
were improving and rendering their ~em porary homes at least&#xD;
comfortable. Horses and carriages ~were abundant, the fall&#xD;
dry, and th~ roads fine. On each pleasant day, gay com-&#xD;
panies of ladies and~children were een in 4~arriages, riding&#xD;
from one plantation to another, att~ded by gentlemen on&#xD;
horseback. Their hospitality, for the most part, was free and&#xD;
open, rather than refined ; their life rough, and far from con-&#xD;
ducing to intellectual or moral progress. Hunting, fishing,&#xD;
riding over their plantations, and looking at their crops, con-&#xD;
stituted the out-door exercise of the gentlemen; cards and&#xD;
other games formed the in-door pastimes. Whiskey and&#xD;
brandy bottles might be seen alongside of the water jar or&#xD;
bucket at one end of the gallery-all Southern residences&#xD;
have galleries-and cigars, pipes, and tobacco, with a servant&#xD;
ready to run for a coal of fire, or a match always on hand.&#xD;
And it was astonishing what an amount of mean whiskey and&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
tobacco were destroyed that fall at Hermit's Bend. Col.&#xD;
Clarkson, having finished his improvements about the first of&#xD;
October, celebrated it by a large dining party, to which all&#xD;
his neighbors on both the Mississippi and Arkansas sides&#xD;
were invited. Accomplished and elegant women, intelligent&#xD;
and beautiful girls, and gentlemen of the "old regim p," were&#xD;
not wantin~ at this entertainment; for no country ct~n bdast&#xD;
of more beauty or chivalry than the South. But there were&#xD;
others at this feast equally well educated, men of weith and&#xD;
position, but whose generous, noble characters had become&#xD;
so vitiated by excess and indulgence, that the sparkle of the&#xD;
wine cup, the rattle of the dice box, and the excitement of&#xD;
the card table, were preferred even to the society of their&#xD;
lovely wives and daughters; and none of them were either&#xD;
drunkards or gamblers. They would have been horrified to&#xD;
have been even suspected of such a thing; would not asso-&#xD;
ciate with one who was suspected. They claimed to drink as&#xD;
a matter of good cheer, and play for amusement, and bet only&#xD;
to count the game.&#xD;
* After the cloth had been removed, and the ladies and&#xD;
younger gentlemen withdrawn to the parlors to listen to good&#xD;
music, or foot it in the dance, tobacco, strong liquors, and&#xD;
cards were called, and the husbands and fathers commenced&#xD;
a game of Poker, a fashionable, gentlemanly sort of betting&#xD;
game down South. They commenced the game not as yearning,&#xD;
but for amusement! They bet, not to win money, but to&#xD;
count the game! It was only five dollars "anti!" and what&#xD;
was that to men of thousands? They played; wives and&#xD;
daughters inquired from time to time "if it was not time to&#xD;
go ?" "Not yet." They played on. The music ceased, and&#xD;
the occasional rumble of carriage-wheels told that the lady&#xD;
guests, one after another, were leaving for home; but the&#xD;
playing continued. They were left alone; evening came;&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8172-00000011"/>&#xD;

lights were brought in, and the game continued. f Nine&#xD;
o'clock came: ten; eleven; twelvee! the game continued;&#xD;
still flit, flit, flit, went the cards; chink, chink, chink, went&#xD;
the money; gluck, gluck, gluck, went the bottle. "I'll go&#xD;
ten better;" "I'll see you ten, and go fifty better;" "I'll see&#xD;
your fifty, and go a hundred ;" "I'll call you;" "What do&#xD;
you do it on ?" "Aces and- ;" "Good." The money is&#xD;
taken down, and the same thing repeated until the closing&#xD;
hours of night. No exercise of the intellect, no generous&#xD;
moral sentiment inspired; only the meanest of man's instincts&#xD;
called into action; his cupidity, his desire for his neighbor's&#xD;
goods. As the plantation bell rung for the negroes to~ turn&#xD;
out, the players reeled to their rooms; not drunk! 0 no,&#xD;
certainly not; only dizzy and weak-jointed from long sitting.&#xD;
A dull sleep until nine o'clock in the morning, a passing&#xD;
apology to Mrs. Clarkson, such as "III fear we kept your break-&#xD;
fast waiting, Madam," and their consciences were put at ~ase;&#xD;
mu~h easier doubtless than their heads. The matter was no&#xD;
more thought of; np apology thought necessary to the wives&#xD;
at home, who counted the weary hours away, waiting their&#xD;
return.&#xD;
To a greater or less extent, this sort of thing was kept up&#xD;
by the gentlemen from time to time throughout the entire&#xD;
fall. All remonstrances on the part of their anxious wives&#xD;
were unavailing. "It was only for amusement," was the&#xD;
answer to all their reluctantly expressed fears. "But why&#xD;
bet ?" "Only to count the game." The invariable answer.&#xD;
"Ther~ why not bet straws or peppercorns ?" "Why, that&#xD;
would be childish and ridiculous." Thus all entreaties were&#xD;
vain, and the playing went on. They had hoped, in consent-&#xD;
ing to spend the fall upon the plantations, that their husbands&#xD;
would be removed from the temptation of the clubs, and&#xD;
saved from this demoralizingvice of playing. They were disap-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
pointed, but not discouraged, as it was some respite, at least,&#xD;
and the vice shorn of 'some of its baldness and moral&#xD;
deformity.&#xD;
Nothing more of note transpired in the county during the&#xD;
fall, until the session of the Circuit Court. It took place&#xD;
late in the season, and brought to the Bend a number of&#xD;
persons from Bluff City; sonic as lawyers, some as client~&#xD;
and witnesses, and some merchants and business men, eolloct~&#xD;
ing and drumming for custom. The court-house was a half~.&#xD;
finished, small, inconvenient building, with benches for the&#xD;
jury, a small stand for the judge, and a long table at which&#xD;
the attorneys sat. A5ong the latter were Frank Vaughan,&#xD;
Nickols, and Smith. Nickols was about as que~r a specimei~i&#xD;
of human nature as one would meet in a life-time's traX+el~&#xD;
lie was well educated, a good lawyer, and a genius in his&#xD;
way, but an odd genius and compound he was: slender, a&#xD;
little knock-kneed, wabbled in his gait, as if his knees were&#xD;
too weak to sustain him. To avpid staggering when intoxi&#xD;
cated, which was by no means a rare occurrence, he would&#xD;
strike off in a sort of dog-trot. He was usually called Old&#xD;
Nick, for short; and when seen in one of these trots, cross-&#xD;
ing the street, it was remarked, "Old Nick 's tight to-day."&#xD;
His feelings and instincts were as refined and delicate as&#xD;
those 6f a woman, but withal he was as grotesque and un-&#xD;
couth as a monkey, coarse as a clown, , and an old bachelor.&#xD;
lie had an inveterate habit of hawking and spitting, and&#xD;
hawked with his mouth wide open, and loud enough to be&#xD;
heard across an ordinary town or~ cornfield, and interspersed&#xD;
his conversation with constant questions, "Do 'you under-&#xD;
stand ?" and closed his witticisms with, "lich? ha, ha, ha !"&#xD;
'When annoyed, or in a brown study, he would ha-a-awk a&#xD;
whole town out of patience. His frar~ e looked much as if it&#xD;
was strung together by wires, and he I~iad a' habit of hoisting&#xD;
~iis feet up over his head against the mantlepiece in winter,&#xD;

and gal1ery~post in summer, or any other object near enough-&#xD;
the side of the house, if nothing else offered-and, crouching&#xD;
down behind his knees, thus making a very unpleasant and&#xD;
indecent exposure of his person in the presence of ladies;&#xD;
for his attitude 'was chosen from habit, and not to suit the&#xD;
character or sex of his company. When he would detect&#xD;
himself in one of these exposures, he would take down his&#xD;
feet ~nd gaze upon the company with one of his longest and&#xD;
loudest ha-a-a-awks.&#xD;
Frank Vaughan was a young man of small, slender sta~&#xD;
ture, with long flaxen locks, which he cultivated with care.&#xD;
He dressed like a dandy, though he was not one. He was a&#xD;
good lawyer, and a young man of promise; and though&#xD;
fond of his good looks, talent, and fine clothes, and stood&#xD;
long before his looking-glass, he was withal affable and kind,&#xD;
and very much liked by his companions.&#xD;
Smith was a good-natured, burly fellow, fond of good eat-&#xD;
ing, and without malice.&#xD;
Among the merchants was a i~Jr. Blunt, an old widower,&#xD;
full of anecdote, good cheer, and old dz~xter, with ruddy face&#xD;
and rotund stomach. lie had been a little of almost any&#xD;
and every thing-horse-trader, gentle~na~n of leisure, (only a&#xD;
decent name for a blackleg,) and merchant, and filled all&#xD;
situations equally well. All the gentlemen were fond of a&#xD;
"good game," as they termed a game of cards, though, like&#xD;
Clarkson, they would take it as an insult to be called gam-&#xD;
blers. They were all well acquainted with Col. Clarkson,&#xD;
and readily consented to make his house their head-quarte~rs.&#xD;

JIIEATJI.&#xD;
LATE in the fall, Col. Clarkson and his family proposed to&#xD;
return to their residence in Bluff City. Several of the-&#xD;
neighboring families, too, were ready to make their regular&#xD;
winter trip to New Orleans; for, be it known, that all fami-&#xD;
lies living contiguous to the Mississippi river, and who have&#xD;
the means to defray the expense, as regularly make an&#xD;
annual visit to the Crescent City as cranes and other water--&#xD;
fowls do to the sea-shore. A good passenger steamer was&#xD;
expected up, to take off the cotton of the neighboring&#xD;
planters, on Sunday night or Monday morning; and as they&#xD;
patronized her with their cotton freight, they were expecting&#xD;
to receive passage free; a species of economy which men.&#xD;
who were profligate in expending for the most trifling ;ancl,&#xD;
sometimes vicious purpose insisted upon. Nickols, Smith,&#xD;
and Blunt accepted the invitation of Clarkson to remain and&#xD;
wait for the steamer. Some of his sportin~ neighbors were&#xD;
invited, tables spread, and cards and liquor produced. No&#xD;
one, of course, bets for money-only for amusement; and, to&#xD;
make it very amusing, it was proposed to make the "anti"&#xD;
ten dollars. At this, Nickols, who was not wealthy, and, as&#xD;
before stated, disposed to be miserly, gave a long, loud&#xD;
ha-a-a-awk; at which Ned, Clarkson's polite serving-man,&#xD;

&#xD;
started, and, supposing that he was about to heave up his&#xD;
dinner or lungs, ran for the basin! which caused a laugh at&#xD;
Nickols's expense, in which he joined as heartily as the rest,&#xD;
not in the least annoyed. The game commenced. Nickols&#xD;
played shyly, Blunt rashly; the one to save his stakes, the&#xD;
other to win. The balance of the players bet on the strength&#xD;
of their hands, putting their money up in a free and easy&#xD;
manner, losing and winning with the same grace and sang&#xD;
froid. Blunt evidently desired to win, and tried the nerve&#xD;
of each of the players in turn. His first run was upon Col.&#xD;
Clarkson, who, he saw, put very little value upon money,&#xD;
and played alone for the love of the game; and, though&#xD;
sometimes vexed and annoyed at being beaten, the losing of&#xD;
his money constituted no part of it. Blunt would "bluff"&#xD;
by betting high on small hands; Clarkson, however, was in-&#xD;
different, betting if he had a hand to bet on, rind not other-&#xD;
wise; betting always on the strength of his own hand, and&#xD;
not on the size of his purse or the presumed weakness of his&#xD;
adversary's hand. Blunt tl~rew out every temptation pos-&#xD;
sibk, by showing, after he had won a stake by "blufling"-&#xD;
that is, betting high on no hand at all-upon what a weak&#xD;
hand h~ had "gone in upon, betting, and talking with the&#xD;
utmost volubility. He possessed the finest conversational&#xD;
powers, and a vast fund of anecdote; and to indifferent&#xD;
observers, such as mafly of the players Were, he appeared to&#xD;
be the most careless, reckless better in the world, and to keep&#xD;
no note or count of thb game, playing for the sake of good&#xD;
company and the pleasure of giving his tongue full play&#xD;
among genial and, appreciative companions. "Colonel, did&#xD;
you ever see I~efont? Queer brick-go ten-travelled with&#xD;
him on the old Michigan, once-a Cincinnati chicken-coop-&#xD;

I 'd been running him pretty hard-pass-why, how foolish!&#xD;
had three tens-he stole my coat-go twenty-pawned it at&#xD;
the bar for liquor-how much was it ]i put up then? seventy-&#xD;
five? very foolish in me-got no hand-and what do you&#xD;
think? the knave treated the whole boat's crew on the faith&#xD;
of it, all hands, cook and, bottle-washer, and it cost me a five&#xD;
to redeem my coat-Smith, loan me a hundred-won, did I?&#xD;
Good-return your hundred-had only a small pair." Thus&#xD;
he ran on, like a machine, betting and losing and bluffing as&#xD;
if by mere chance thoughtlessness. Ii3ut it had no effect&#xD;
upon Clarkson. It neither diverted his mind from the game&#xD;
to make a foolish bet, nor excited his cupidity enough to&#xD;
tempt him to increase his stake. He would have regarded&#xD;
it as ungentlemanly, and a breach of good hospitality in him&#xD;
to take advantage of his guest's carelessness and good humor&#xD;
to win his money. 'Failing in this, Blunt tried one after&#xD;
another, with no better success, until he came to Nickols.&#xD;
~Ie had selected him last because his "pile" was the smallest,&#xD;
and he preferred running down larger gam6. Nickols, in&#xD;
playing to save, to keep even, had managed to accumulate a&#xD;
considerable stake, and had been sinking it in his pockets&#xD;
unobs~rvcd, as he hoped, by the others. "Why, Nickols,&#xD;
you h~ive a considerable stake there, I see," said Blunt; "I&#xD;
must try and reduce it for you, and see if I can't call back&#xD;
to the table some of those bank-notes I noticed you stifling&#xD;
in your capacious vest-pocket." The answer was a loud&#xD;
ha-a-a-awk, which roused Ned from his nodding attitude&#xD;
beside the sideboard, and caused him to start again for the&#xD;
basin. Nickols had been wide awake to his interest, and&#xD;
had watched the game and his growing heaps with keen&#xD;
relish. "Ha-a-a-awk! Colonel, give me a chew of tobacco."&#xD;
Tobacco - begging, even when his pockets were full of the&#xD;
weed, was another of his weaknesses. It was Blunt's deal.&#xD;

"The thunder and lightning you say! I thought you wire&#xD;

This had the effect to silence Blunt for some time and it&#xD;
took several stiff pulls at the brandy-bottle before he co kid&#xD;
get his tongue in good running-order again, In tryin2 to&#xD;
catch others, he was himself caught, andy first and last, ~he&#xD;
was loser some thousand or more dollars, a sum he was by no&#xD;
means able to lose, having a sister and four children at home,&#xD;
subsisting upon a rather short allowance.&#xD;
The game continued until ne~r day on Sunday morning!&#xD;
no one reflecting that it was the "Lord's day !" They had&#xD;
drunk unusually deep, and their playing and loud laughing,&#xD;
with an occasional oath, had kept all the adult persons&#xD;
about the premises awake until it closed. Mrs. Clarkson,&#xD;
without being a member of any Church, had been raised by pious&#xD;
parents, and was of a religious turn of mind, and had all a re-&#xD;
fined lady's respect for the Sabbath and holy things, and felt so&#xD;
horrified at this desecration of Sunday, that she had not slept&#xD;
a wink. At what time the players broke up the game, and ho~&#xD;
they got to their rooms, they could not tell. They thPew&#xD;
themselves down upon their beds, two and three together, with-&#xD;
out undressing and were soomi in a deep, oblivious slumber.&#xD;
The house becoming quiet, the sleep of all its inmates was&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.                27&#xD;
profound. How long Mrs. Clarkson had been asleepwhen&#xD;
she had been aroused by two reports of a gun in quick suc-&#xD;
cession, and a sense of suffocation, she could form no esti-&#xD;
mate; but she awoke and found her room full of smoke, .and&#xD;
the whole house in flames; and the fire raging with tremen-&#xD;
dous fury. The night had been warm and pleasant, and the&#xD;
playing had taken place in the passage, and an unextin-&#xD;
guished candle or the stump of a cigar had been left, from&#xD;
which the house took fire, and, being coiled and papered, and&#xD;
very dry and inflammable, it burned like brushwood, and the&#xD;
drowsy inmates had barely time to escape before the beds&#xD;
they slept upon were in flames. Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson&#xD;
sprang up and seized hold of their younger children, sleep-&#xD;
ing. in their room, aroused the nurse, and, throwing blankets&#xD;
over them, rushed out through the flames, scorched a~ d&#xD;
terror-stricken. They gathered in a gro~ip, a little remo~'ed&#xD;
from the fire, and looked eagerly and hastily around to&#xD;
if all were ~aved, when a long, lot!d, terrified shriek went up&#xD;
from Agnes's room.&#xD;
'~ 0 my God !" exclaimed Mrs. Clarkson; and rushed wildly&#xD;
towards the burning building, now almost completely enveloped&#xD;
in flame.&#xD;
"Great God! 0 my daughter! my sweet, my 'angel&#xD;
daughter," and with his wife, Clarkson rushed madly to the&#xD;
flame, but it drove them back!&#xD;
"Save my daughter! my daughter !" loudly both cried.&#xD;
The awakened negroes came running in crowds, half clad,&#xD;
from the quarter.&#xD;
"Freedom to any that will save my daughter! Freedom&#xD;
to any that will save my daughter! Can nobody save her?&#xD;
0 God.! 0 God !"&#xD;
Strange how the wicked, in time of trouble, will call upon&#xD;
the Great God! The shrieks from Agnes continued, and the&#xD;
black tide from the quarter rushed to the rescue, not from ~i&#xD;

desire of freedom, but love of their young mistress, and a&#xD;
human instinct, a powerful passion with the negro when&#xD;
called into action. They were driven back bfirnt and suffo-&#xD;
cated. The old woi~an who had nursed Agnes in infancy,&#xD;
hearing her cry loud and wildly, "0 Aunt Fanny, Aunt&#xD;
Fanny I save mc! save me I" pushed into the flames, stum-&#xD;
bled, fell, and was burnt aliv~. At this fearful moment, the&#xD;
tall form of the Her~nit, with his white locks streaming in&#xD;
the wind, and a dripping blanket in his hand, dashed past,&#xD;
with the blanket over him. The flame lifted for a moment;&#xD;
he bounded' forward into the room, wrapped the exhausted&#xD;
girl in the blanket, covered his mouth and nostrils with his&#xD;
hand, closed his eyes, pushed through the flame, and emerged&#xD;
from the smoke bearing her in his arms. His gray locks&#xD;
were crisped up, and his feet and limbs were so badly burned,&#xD;
that when his boots were ripped off, the baked skin followed-&#xD;
a most sad sight. The mother was beside herself with joy,&#xD;
and sank down unable to utter a word; but her manner and&#xD;
gestures were far more eloquent of her thanks and gratitude&#xD;
than words co~ild have been. Clarkson expre~ed in every&#xD;
way a fond father could, his thanks, and all gathered around&#xD;
the old man, offering congratulations and sympathy; but he&#xD;
rather repulsed them; was annoyed at the thanks of the pa-&#xD;
rents, and the congra1~ulations of the others. The fresh air&#xD;
having restored Agnes, as soon as Mrs. Clarkson could speak,&#xD;
she asked:&#xD;

[         "I knew she would! I knew she would I" exclaimed the&#xD;
old man; the first words he had spoken. "I stayed all night&#xD;
by your window, until the lights were extinguished, and all&#xD;

went to bed. i[ felt a shadow of evil to come, and was re-&#xD;
luctant to leave you, and did not until Ii asked her to protect&#xD;
you; and she did."&#xD;
Agnes threw her arms around him, kissed his face over&#xD;
and over, dropped her head in his lap as he sat at the root of&#xD;
an old gum tree, and 'sobbed away. The big tears slowly&#xD;
gathered, from a deep spring, into the old man's eyes, and&#xD;
dropped one by one into 'his kind bosom. Empty-hearted as&#xD;
Blunt was, he turned ~off and brushed away a tear; and&#xD;
Nickols, who had but little room in his heart for any thing&#xD;
besides dollars or bank-notes, pulled out his handkerchief' and&#xD;
went hawking off to the river-bank.&#xD;
The Hermit was conveyed to his cottage, and Col. Clarkson&#xD;
and his wife, finding that their attentions were disagreeable&#xD;
to him, did all they could for his relief through Agnes, 1~he&#xD;
only person he would have about him. The remains of kind&#xD;
old Aunt Fanny, who had fallen a mai4yr to her love for her&#xD;
foster-child, were taken from the ruins and decently interred&#xD;
in the plantation burying-ground.&#xD;
Fears were entci~tained by the physician who had been&#xD;
summoned to prescribe for the Hermit, as well as by (Ilarkson&#xD;
and wife, that his injuries might prove fatal, and Agnes&#xD;
hearing of it,'could not conceal from the patient, suffering old&#xD;
man her anxiety. One day, as she sat weeping by his bed-&#xD;
side, he interrupted her by saying:&#xD;
"Do not mind what they tell you, my sweet child; I shall&#xD;
get well. My time has not come; my mission for you is not&#xD;
fulfilled; more remains for me to do."&#xD;
She did not understand him, but she was satisfied. Such&#xD;
was her faith in him, that there was nothing she would not&#xD;
have believed at his telling. He did not himself understand&#xD;
fully what he meant, but he felt that he had spoken truly.&#xD;
That he would get well, and that he would be of future ser-&#xD;
vice to her, lie felt as certainly as if the book of the future&#xD;

were open before him,. How much' on!e feels, that he can&#xD;
neither explain nor understand; nor, as the world goes, know;&#xD;
but which he believes, and upon which he acts with as much&#xD;
confidence as upon absolute certainty! How it is, and why&#xD;
it is, no philosopher has undertaken to explain; and he would&#xD;
fail were he to attempt it. One's feelings-presetitiments,&#xD;
anxieties, and heartaches-one's liking' and dislikings, are&#xD;
often as inexplicable as the coming and going of the swallow,&#xD;
and may be relied on with as much certainty. At some&#xD;
period in each man's life, he has seen or rather felt the same&#xD;
shadowy vision which the patriarch describes. "In thoughts&#xD;
from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth ou men,&#xD;
fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my&#xD;
hones to shake. Then a spirit passed before my face; the&#xD;
hair of my head stood up! It stood still, but I could not&#xD;
discern the form thereof: an image was before mine eyes;&#xD;
there~ was silence, and II heard a voice' saying, Shall mortal&#xD;
man b~ more just than God? Shall man be more pure than&#xD;
his Maker ~" lit comes, he knows not how; perhaps in the&#xD;
wind, as it whispers to the leaves in the solitude of the "grand&#xD;
old wQods ;" perhaps in the throes of the monarch of the&#xD;
forest, as it fiing~ its giant arms about in the storm; perhaps&#xD;
in the hum of the busy city, the chime of church-bells, the&#xD;
swell of the cathedral choir, or as he looks upon the broken&#xD;
monuments of past grandeur. All are certain to feel it at&#xD;
some time; the more impressible, the oftener and the more&#xD;
distinctly it is felt. What it reveals cannot be 'learned from&#xD;
philosophy; it is not in the books; no man has written it;&#xD;
no man will write it. lit is written' by the finger of God upon&#xD;
the heart, and the stains of sin may blurr or blunt it, but&#xD;
cannot efface it. The old man felt what he said, and said it&#xD;
because he felt it. Let proud philosophy mock and cry,&#xD;
Superstition! men will feel in spite of philosophy.&#xD;

First, two entire pheasants he ate;&#xD;
Then swept a seasoned leg of mutton from his plate.&#xD;
MOLIERE'S TAIITUFE.&#xD;
AT Agnes's earnest request and the silently expressed wish&#xD;
of the Hermit, it was determined to have a room prepared&#xD;
her in the overseers house, whose kind-hearted wife promised&#xD;
to do all she could to make her comfortable, and leave her&#xD;
there until the Hermit's sufferings should terminate one way&#xD;
or the other. Accordingly, the carpenters were 'set to work,&#xD;
and, in an incredibly short time, the room was rcady to r,~ceive&#xD;
the plain home-made furniture which Mrs. Blake ~l~spare,&#xD;
it being the best she had. It was soon replaced by something&#xD;
more elegant, which the ever-kind parents sent to her as soon&#xD;
as they arrived at Bluff City, but which Agnes thought&#xD;
nothing of:, being content with what was supplied by her&#xD;
simple, kind-hearted hostess. The balance of the family&#xD;
went to the Bluffs.&#xD;
When Col. Clarkson arrived in Bluff City, lie engaged his&#xD;
family physician, Dr. Floyd, to go up and attend upon the&#xD;
Hermit. Under ordinary circumstances, the doctor could not&#xD;
have been induced to have gone, even for the large fee offered&#xD;
by Col. Clarkson, being fond of the society of the clubs, and&#xD;
dreading nothing more than the ennui of country life. But&#xD;
he had just lost his only sister, Mrs. Hamilton, a widow lady&#xD;
of great wealth and piety. She had been a belle in her&#xD;
younger years, and he had, when a 'young man, been very&#xD;

&#xD;
fond of her; and his affection survived the wreck of his good&#xD;
morals and the formation of other ties. He had never mar-&#xD;
ried; was a man of high standing in the community, both as&#xD;
a gentleman and physician, but fond of all sorts of dissolute&#xD;
entertainments; and if at any time he ht~d gone to bed with-&#xD;
out a lunch or oyster supper with some friends, (and they&#xD;
were chosen at random,) he would have felt that something of&#xD;
importance had lceen forgotten, and co~id not have slept u:atil&#xD;
he had called to mind what it was. His sister was universally&#xD;
beloved for her amiable and other fine qualities of heart and&#xD;
head. She very much regretted the loose kind of life her&#xD;
brother led, but loved and confided in him all the same. She&#xD;
left to his charge her only son, Robert, a youth of some four-&#xD;
teen or fifteen years of age, with the earnest request that he&#xD;
should be brought up as she had begun with him; with moral&#xD;
and pious habits, and under no circumstances to "let him ever&#xD;
see the inside of a gambling-hell." The Doctor was affected&#xD;
and embarrassed, but gave a full, heartfelt promise.&#xD;
Robert had been sick, and was just convalescent when his&#xD;
mother died. It was with these new feelings, subdued by&#xD;
the loss of a sister, whose purity and loveliness had so often&#xD;
stood between him and vice, and whose beautiful and silent&#xD;
example had all unknown to himself 1 checked him in his&#xD;
Y        excesses, and with a momentary distaste fo~ joyous, boister-&#xD;
ous companionship, that he readily consented to go up to&#xD;
the Bend and attend upon the I~1ermit.&#xD;
The Doctor desired to take his nephew along with him,&#xD;
thinking that the change of scene and country air might be&#xD;
f ~&#xD;
of service, after his long and severe attack of illness; and,&#xD;
as no objection was made by the, family, Robert accompanied&#xD;
his uncle.&#xD;
There was a house, with a large single room, standing in&#xD;
the corner of the overseer's yard, used as a sort of omnium&#xD;
4         gatherum about the plantation, which was fitted up an(l dOfl~&#xD;
&#xD;
K               PLAYING FOR AMTJS~MENT.&#xD;
averted into an office for the Doctor, where he and Robert&#xD;
were accommodated with lodging. The Doctor soon found&#xD;
that he could be of but little service to his patient, as he de-~&#xD;
dined to receive his aid. The refusal seem to arise from an&#xD;
unwillingness on the part of the Hermit to accept a reward&#xD;
for an act prompted by an impulse as inexplicable to himself&#xD;
as to others, but in doing which had never taken into account&#xD;
the desire of the anxious, agonized parents, and not from a&#xD;
perverse disposition. In doing what he did, he had not&#xD;
thought of others, was entirely indifferent to them, and*&#xD;
hence would take no favor based upon it. He paid no&#xD;
earthly attention to the Doctor, nor to others who called to&#xD;
see him and offer their services, He iieither expressed&#xD;
annoyance nor pleasure when they came, neither relief nor&#xD;
regret when they left.&#xD;
The Doctor was a ki~id-hearted man, and, thoi~.gli rude in&#xD;
his morals, appreciated a generous action, and admired the&#xD;
incorruptible integrity of the Hermit, who Would not, by&#xD;
accepting the well-meant kindness of Col. Clarkson, say that&#xD;
in what he did the Colonel or his wife had been thought of;&#xD;
and he was deeply interested in his patient. He felt, when&#xD;
in his presence, and seeing not a muscle move, nor the slight-&#xD;
est expression of pain, though evidently suffering torment&#xD;
from pain the most excruciating the human system can well&#xD;
*   endure, that he was in the presence of no ordinary person-&#xD;
age; and his anxiety to serve him increasQd with his respect&#xD;
for his patient. ]3'roni what Col. Clarkson told him, he was&#xD;
*    prepared to see a resolute, enduring old man; but he was not&#xD;
expecting to meet a piece of mental iron. He had often&#xD;
met with obstinate patients, and peevish ones, who refused&#xD;
his prescriptions, but he generally found means to overcome&#xD;
their obstinacy and peevishness; but here was a man in his&#xD;
perfect senses who would not only not recognize his pre-&#xD;
server, but, though enduring most racking pain, would not,&#xD;

by the motion of a muscle or a sigh, acknowledge the pre-&#xD;
sence of pain or disease. For the first time in his. life he&#xD;
felt cheapened. He was inspired with a feeling of reve-&#xD;
rence, almost awe, as he looked upon the stern, silent, suffer-&#xD;
ing old man. Agnes was tl~e only person or thing he would&#xD;
unbend to, and at times he would caress her. Observing&#xD;
this, it occurred to the Doctor that he would try his nephew,&#xD;
and see if the old man would notice him. It was his wish&#xD;
to get some one between him and his patient, through whom&#xD;
he could prescribe for his wounds. He would have tried&#xD;
Agnes; but there was something in her innocence and purity&#xD;
which made him feel at a distance, and she had always instinct-&#xD;
ively shrunk from him when he approached. Acco:udingly,&#xD;
when he called agLiin, he took Robert with him. As the&#xD;
young boy stepped into the room, the Hermit turned and&#xD;
held out his hand to him, took hold of the lad's and held it,&#xD;
looking huin steadily but kindly in the face for some time.&#xD;
After surveying his feittures carefully, he said:&#xD;
"You are' welcome. I am glad to see you. I am not dis-&#xD;
appointed; better pleased than I expected."&#xD;
Agnes and the Doctor were astonished; for they were not&#xD;
aware that he had ever heard of iRobert before. It is pos-&#xD;
sible that something in Agnes's manner n~ay have caused the&#xD;
Hermit to suspect that her old playfellow had ~accompanied&#xD;
th~ Doctor in his visit to the Bend. He answered her look&#xD;
of astonishment by a smile and a nod of the head, as if&#xD;
assentin~ to some thing. Well mio'ht the Hermit, severe as&#xD;
was his criticism and judgment, be satisfied with the perusal&#xD;
of Robert's face. He was a noble boy: a fine, open counte-&#xD;
nance, forehead high, square and broad chest, eyes large and&#xD;
lustrous, limbs lithe and* muscular, hands small, intelligent,&#xD;
thoughtful look, and a soft expression about the mouth and&#xD;
lips that 'had an agreeable, softening effect upon the harder&#xD;
outlines of the face; and his half-invalid appearance and&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.                 35&#xD;
subdued sorrow gave an additional charm to his looks. It&#xD;
was evident that the Hermit was pleased with him, and the.&#xD;
Doctor saw in it means to earn at least a portion of the large&#xD;
fee Col. Clarkson engaged to pay for Jiis services. He gave&#xD;
his prescriptions to Robert, and Robert and Agnes entered&#xD;
into a conspiracy to force the old man to observe them.&#xD;
They had the frankness to tell him all about it, and it was&#xD;
wonderful how completely he would unbend to them, and do&#xD;
whatever he thought would give them pleasure. The reme-&#xD;
dies were simple and easily applied, and the old man soon&#xD;
found relief.&#xD;
Time soon began to hang heavily upon the Doctor's hands,&#xD;
and the neighbors who played were not slow in finding~ out&#xD;
0&#xD;
that he liked a good game and a drink of good brandy, and&#xD;
would take even a mean article, if good could not be had;&#xD;
and, "to make his time pass pleasantly while among them,"&#xD;
converted his temporary office into a gambling-shop. No,&#xD;
that word may be thought offensive. They did not gamble;&#xD;
only played for amusement, and bet to count th&#xD;
Robert had been taught to call things by their  game.&#xD;
and to look upon gambling as gambling, and, in his inno-&#xD;
cence, he could not see the difference between betting to&#xD;
count the game and betting to win money, if the effect were&#xD;
the same. His morals were pure, his ideas single, and he&#xD;
made no compromise with vice; and hence, whe~ii he 'saw&#xD;
his uncle sit down at a table with three or four other&#xD;
gentlemen, and sit there all day, and sometimes nearly all&#xD;
night, playing at cards, and betting high and drinking deep,&#xD;
and then swear at the negro appointed to wait upon him for&#xD;
a piece of cold muLton, salt, and mustard, he very naturally&#xD;
concluded that his guardian and only living blood rqia~ive&#xD;
was a gambler and drunkard. If the Doctor had suspected&#xD;
K such a thought in his nephew, it would have made him more&#xD;
prudent and private, if not more abstemious; for lie loved&#xD;

his nephew, and was really anxious to fulfil his promise to&#xD;
his deceased sister, and thought he was doing it, by uni-&#xD;
formly sending him to church on Sunday, though he never&#xD;
went himself. And, as to his promise that he should "never&#xD;
see the inside of a gambling-hell," he thought it was the&#xD;
easiest of all promises to keep, as he never visited such a&#xD;
place himself; little supposing that that sister would have&#xD;
regarded his office as no better. 'A gambling "hell" was a&#xD;
place set apart and kept expressly for gambling, where men&#xD;
played for money, and bet to win, and not a doctor's office,&#xD;
where gentlemen played to amuse themselves and kill time,&#xD;
and bet to count the game. The thought of any one regard-&#xD;
ing him as a gambler, would have horrified him; much more&#xD;
for his nephew to do so. The first shock upon Rol)ert was&#xD;
painful, and, like Agnes, he instinctively shrank from his&#xD;
touch. By degrees, however, a~ he became more familiar with&#xD;
it, he felt less repugnance towards it, and his respect for his&#xD;
uncle began to revive. His uncle had also noticed the change&#xD;
in his demeanor toward him, and, having a vague fear that&#xD;
it might proceed from his disrelish of his playing, took pains&#xD;
to vindicate himself by showing how innocent it was, and&#xD;
what a wide difference there was between that and the&#xD;
"odious, detestable vice of gambling." He was so decided&#xD;
in his condemnation of that vic~, and in his abhorrence of a&#xD;
professional gambler-the most despicable of men, in his&#xD;
estimation-that Robert felt ashamed of his ignorance, and&#xD;
came to look upon playing for amusement, and betting to&#xD;
count the game, as a most innocent recreation and gentle-&#xD;
manly pastime. He soon learned the cards, their value and&#xD;
use, and the different games. The Doctor was not alarmed,&#xD;
and he felt that he wits fulfilling his promise to the letter,&#xD;
when Sunday came, by getting Mr. Blake to have Ccl. Clark-&#xD;
son's carriage brought out, and Robert sent to church, a dis-&#xD;
tance of some eight miles.&#xD;
&#xD;
Even cards and brandy, with, men to help play and drink,&#xD;
were insufficient to detain him from his club companions,&#xD;
oysters, and lunch; and, leaving Robert to help nurse his pa-&#xD;
tient, he returned to Bluff City. Col. Clarlison felt annoyed&#xD;
and disappointed at his leaving before his "friend had been&#xD;
put upon his feet," but, as he was out of all danger, he paid&#xD;
the fee without complaint; the Doctor declaring that he&#xD;
wonid not bury himself so another fortnight, for the Colonel's&#xD;
plantation.&#xD;

which secured to her this high privilege, she might have called&#xD;

been to boarding-school? and could n't they sketch with the&#xD;
pencil? no matter if they did have to hold the pattern to the&#xD;
window to do it. And couldn't they play on the piano, and&#xD;
make it mak~ as much noise as anybody? And hadn't they&#xD;
lungs, and couldn't they use them; and sing as loud as other&#xD;
folks? They could, unquestionably, and a little louder. Yes,&#xD;
Mr. Piper had all this, and "the girls" could do all that,&#xD;

UPON the arrival of Mr. a~id Mrs. Clarkson at their home&#xD;
in Bluff City, the fashionable and upper-tens-for Bluff City&#xD;
had its upper-tens as well as other towns-were thrown into&#xD;
a sort of high-bred hysterics, each being emulous to make&#xD;
the "first call." The rich rode in their fine equipages, with&#xD;
splendid trappings. Such a newishness and show of finery&#xD;
The carriages were new, horses new, dresses new and flary,&#xD;
jewelry n~w and shiny, footmen new and awkward; every&#xD;
thing was new, new, new! One f9t surfeited with the new-&#xD;
ness and glitter. But it made a sensation, and that was&#xD;
enough; it was bought for that purpose. They did not re-&#xD;
fleet that a monkey-show or a circus would have done the&#xD;
same thing, and perhaps to a greater degree. But as they&#xD;
were pleased with the gild, others had no right to be dis-&#xD;
pleased, as it was all paid for, and where the money came&#xD;
from that paid for it was nobody's business.&#xD;
Miss Blunt, the maiden sister of Mr. Blunt, and who took&#xD;

but, somehow or other, they neither pulled in, nor were pulled&#xD;
by the fashionable wagon; fine folks would n't go, and fine&#xD;
birds would n't fly to their house. What was the reason? he&#xD;
asked himself a thousand tini9s, but the question was unan-&#xD;
swered. One thing was certain, neither he, nor Betsy, nor&#xD;
"the girls" went to Mrs. Clarkson's; and another thing was&#xD;
equally certain; Mrs. Clarkson did not expect them; and an-&#xD;
other thing is just as certain as that, which, if it had been&#xD;
known to Piper at the time, Betsy and "the girls" would&#xD;
have gone; if they had gone, Mrs. Clarkson would have be~n&#xD;
just as well pleased to have seen them, and treated them with,&#xD;
just as much politeness, as she did the newly-fledged birds&#xD;
of fashion that flitted in and out of her parlors every morning&#xD;

Mr. Piper was what Ovid would call: "Rara avis in terr~s,&#xD;
mgro quo simillima c~,,gno-a rare bird on the earth, most&#xD;
likely a black swan." He was a dealer in hides and hoofs,&#xD;
was full of action and energy, stepped spry, and fussy as a&#xD;
hen with a field full of chickens; quick and keen at a trade,&#xD;
and would cut a man and his purse right in two, and take the&#xD;
biggest half; h~dno social nor business status, and morbidly&#xD;
anxious for both. He was too avaricious, and afraid of losing,&#xD;
to engage in a business that required talent and capital-the&#xD;
only kind that could give a business status-and too proud&#xD;
to associate witi~ persons of his class; and the rich and fhsh-&#xD;
ionable were to9 proud to associate with him; and he and&#xD;
Betsy and "thu girls,"were a society to themselves; but&#xD;
his fretting and fuming made it manifestt that he was far from&#xD;
being satisfied that the wonderful accomplishments of "the&#xD;
girls" should be hid away in a "pent-up Utica."&#xD;
lit was Friday, and chanced to be a busy day in town;&#xD;
the tide of buyers and sellers, and ladies sunning them-&#xD;

sidewalks and fine carriages, ~nd horses champing the bit&#xD;

and pawing the uneven stones, crowded the street; and Piper&#xD;
was seeh rushing along, stemming the tide, with whip in&#xD;
hand-he always rode; had so much business could n't&#xD;
walk-was a good judge of a horse; had a fine one; got&#xD;
him cheap: the fellow fairly squealed when lie put his&#xD;
trading irons on him, and swapped him out of his horse.&#xD;
There he goes, elbowing his way through the crowded street,&#xD;
to all appearances the busiest man in it. He seized hold of&#xD;
his "particular friend," and, taking him to one side, desired&#xD;
that he would take occasion to impress upon Mr. the&#xD;
great advantages of a trade which Piper wanted to make&#xD;
with him, as a friend could always do more in effecting a&#xD;
trade than the parties themselves. While full of his subject,&#xD;
and his face beaming as the prospect of a successful trade&#xD;
danced before him, (for his friend consented to enter into&#xD;
the conspiracy against Mr. -~,) he heard the clerk at the&#xD;
corner where they were standing ask the niece of another of&#xD;
Piper's friends how she enjoyed herself at Mrs. Corbin's&#xD;
party, the evening before. His countenance darkened, and -&#xD;
his nostrils spread, and nose flattened, and' ~ixnder-lip drooped.&#xD;
What, a party in town, and his girls not invited, and he not&#xD;
even know it? Too bad! The trade was forgotten, and he&#xD;
walked about as if he had lost a friend or missed a good&#xD;
bargain; got upon Gilpin, and galloped home to tell~ it to&#xD;
Betsy, and groan over it. Gilpin had two sorts of gallops, to&#xD;
to suit the humor of his master. When a good trade was on&#xD;
hand, ot one had just been made, and he~was galloping home&#xD;
to tell Betsy, Gilpin 4~arried his head and tail up-lie had&#xD;
a long tail-and touched the ground as if he scorned it a~i&#xD;
not good enough for him. It was refreshing to see the air&#xD;
of cheerfulness horse and rider had at such times; but~,ii n&#xD;
occasions like the present, Gihjiln's head, unbraced J~K he&#xD;

spread nose, she knew that things had not gone well. It&#xD;
looked t~o much like an adder's head t9 venture to ask ques-&#xD;
tions, and she sat in silence, waiting to see who would get&#xD;
bit, as, when in that humor, he was certain to drive his tooth&#xD;
into somebody. Though full of his subj ect, he did not&#xD;
know how to introduce it. He scolded his. man Garrison, a&#xD;
lazy, ugly negro-man, that no one about the house could&#xD;
tolerate, except himself; he pushed IRichic, a smart little&#xD;
boy of two years, rudely from him, and ordered an older one&#xD;
to leave the room with his stick-horse; but it all would not&#xD;
do. Betsy sat sewing a~Vay, and would u't ask, "What 'was&#xD;
the matter ?" The adder-head was still there, and she would&#xD;
not risk receiving the fang, to gratify her curiosity. His pa-&#xD;
tience gave out after awhile, and, as Betsy would n't ask~, he&#xD;
had no alternative but to tell, without asking, and began:&#xD;
"We. must give the girls a party, Betsy."&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Piper! What in the world 1"&#xD;
"They are just as good. as other girls, and Ii am just as&#xD;
able to give parties as Mrs. Corbin; and the girls are just as&#xD;
much entitled to be invited to parties as Miss Thoruhili or&#xD;
anybody else."&#xD;
"And who said they was n' t ?"&#xD;
"Mrs. Corbin had as well said so. She gave a party last&#xD;
night, and did n't invite them."&#xD;
"Mrs. Corbin! Well, she' need n't be putting on airs!&#xD;
She had a rj~ht to give parties, if she wants to; and if she&#xD;
doesn't want our girls to eat her bread, we've got enough for&#xD;
them at 'ho~ihe! I would n't give that [snapping her fingers]&#xD;
for Sal Corbin, nor her party, nor all she's ~'got."&#xD;
]3etsy ha&amp;amp;a way of calling people's given names, and kept&#xD;
up~the backwoods habit of using old-fashioned nicknames,&#xD;
and the emphasis she gave it meant more than type can&#xD;
express. ,S~at was emphasized. Mrs. Corbin and her friends&#xD;
~.    wrote it "Sallie ;" and "Mrs. Salhie Corbin," pronounced&#xD;
&#xD;
with a sweet drawing-room accent, sounded very well-was&#xD;
rather agreeable to the ear; but "Sal," especially when pro-&#xD;
nounced in a broad tone, by a harsh, double-grater voice,&#xD;
was horrible! To hear Betsy do hex~ best on it, and this was&#xD;
one of her best efforts, the dignity of Mrs. Corbin's party,&#xD;
and the indignity shown "the girls," ~n not inviting them,&#xD;
fell, in Piper's estimation, fifty per cent. every crack she&#xD;
took at it; and, before she let "Sal" off, ~e thought it a&#xD;
fortunate thing and a compliment paid "the girls," in not&#xD;
inviting them.&#xD;
"Sal Corbin! I knew Sal when she was a child, and&#xD;
stupid and awkward enough she was! Sal! When she gets&#xD;
tired giving parties, I'd 'advise her to send some of her spare&#xD;
change or old party dresses to her sister, making dresses for&#xD;
a living at Pewterville; and glad enough she would be to&#xD;
get them. Sal sewed upon, many a dress I 'ye worn before&#xD;
that smirking face of hem caught Mr. (Jorbin, with his&#xD;
rheumatism and gout, and wheedled him -hito leaving her his&#xD;
property when he died. And S~ikc Thornhill! She was&#xD;
there, eh! She had better clear up 'that scandal about her&#xD;
old dead daddy, before she puts on airs. [Now Susie never&#xD;
put on airs: she was a modest girl.] And Mrs. Smith was&#xD;
there, w~as she? She 'd better feed her old beef-eating hus-&#xD;
band with a sassage-stuffer. lie looks as if she did. And&#xD;
Manner Phillips was there! I know'd. her in the lifetime&#xD;
of her first husband. I 'spose she has forgot what people&#xD;
said then about her, and the man she's got now. If she&#xD;
has, other folks hay n't. And as f6r Jude Brown, she never&#xD;
had sense enough to sleep by herself:, or she would never&#xD;
have married that old gambler."&#xD;
Under such a powerful alk4iest, the mountain of aristo-&#xD;
cratic pride that had weighed ~1own ?iper's spirits, gradu~&#xD;
ally melted away, and his nose resumed its proper shape.&#xD;

"Well, Betsy," said he, in a much more cheerful to~ne,&#xD;
"the girls shall have their party, anyhow I"&#xD;
So it was determined; and by the time it was a~l talked&#xD;
o er, it was two o'clock and past, and it was to be given that&#xD;
night; for, with Piper, it was "no quicker said than done."&#xD;
Betsy was flurried, and "the girls" were flurried, and Pi~ei~&#xD;
was fidgety. A party was a new thing in the history of the&#xD;
family: ai~d the thought of the thing was as intoxicating as&#xD;
a gill of "old red-head." Gilpin was saddled, and away&#xD;
went Piper to tell his next-door neighbor, and consult--he&#xD;
was great on consultations.&#xD;
"Betsy has been thinking about giving the girls a little&#xD;
party; just a little social gathering; not exactly a party;&#xD;
just a little social gathering; and II thought I would talk&#xD;
with you about it. I know so few of the young gentlemen&#xD;
about town, and there are so few that one likes to have yisit&#xD;
their daughters, that I thought II w uld consult you who to&#xD;
invite."&#xD;
"There are quite a number to cho se from," naming some&#xD;
*h~df-dozen or more of the leading gentlemen of town; but&#xD;
somehow they did not exactly strike Piper's fancy-whether&#xD;
because ~e did not like them, or I~ecause he feared i;hey&#xD;
would not attend, he did not say; perhaps the latter; and&#xD;
others, uon whom the party-giving class set a less high esti-&#xD;
mate up~n, were named.&#xD;
"AhI they will do. I like them better. They are 'very&#xD;
nice young men. And"-throwing up his head slightly,&#xD;
and prolonging the a-n-d--" I'll invite some of those you&#xD;
first naked too."&#xD;
Off he starts for 0-ilpin, and, as he is about to mount, calls&#xD;
out, "You must be sure to come early."&#xD;
Away goes Gilpin; and it is remarkable what a change in&#xD;
his gallop! How briskly and nimbly he bounds along!&#xD;
&#xD;
.F&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
Any one could see at~a glance that horse and rider were act-&#xD;
ing under a spur. lie meets one of the gentlemen on his&#xD;
list; takes him to one side:&#xD;
"There will be son~e young folks at my house to-night,&#xD;
and I want you to come out."&#xD;
"Thank von."&#xD;
Takes him by th~ arm: "You must be sure to core !"&#xD;
"If I can, I will; but Ii have been very busy to-day, and&#xD;
we have just received a large lot of goods, and they must&#xD;
be opened and marked this evening; and there is only one&#xD;
other clerk in the store now besides myself, one being absent,&#xD;
and another sick; and it is possible I may not be able to&#xD;
attend, which ]i should very much regret, as I should b6&#xD;
pleased to attend."&#xD;
"0, you must come! Ii can't do without you. A-n-d&#xD;
[giving his head a toss] there'll be some nice young girls&#xD;
there."&#xD;
He did not leave the young man until he gave his positive&#xD;
promise to attend. His excuse was real, and was not 'made&#xD;
from a disinclination to make the acquaintance of Piper's&#xD;
faniily.&#xD;
So he continued, until his complement of young men was&#xD;
made up, extorting from each a positive proh~ise to attend.&#xD;
Having gone through his list of young men, his next move&#xD;
was to gallop around and secure the attendance of some&#xD;
young ladies; ~nd it was curious to see how stiffly Gilpin&#xD;
moved as he passed Mrs. Corbin's, a how both horse and&#xD;
rider unbent as they approached the residences of those&#xD;
honored with an invitation to the proposed entertainment.&#xD;
Satisfied with his success, he galloped home, to report pro-&#xD;
gress to Betsy~ As he passed along, people remarked some-&#xD;
thing good must have happened to Piper, from the freshness&#xD;
of Gilpin's gait. He and Betsy chatted it over; both were&#xD;
satisfied; but nothing yet had been done towards getting&#xD;

ready to entertain their guests; and they did not know well&#xD;
how to begin. Piper did not seem exactly satisfied with&#xD;
Betsy's plain good sense in arranging for so important an&#xD;
event; nor did he feel willing to trust his own judgment.&#xD;
They were happily relieved from this dilemma by a timely&#xD;
visit from one of Piper's' relatives, a lady of~ some taste and&#xD;
experience in such matters, who, upon he~ng advised of what&#xD;
was in prospect, kindly offered her assistance. Bet~y, who&#xD;
did not wish to be thought unequal to the task of preparing&#xD;
properly' for a party, but who was, nevertheless, anxious to&#xD;
have the advantage of her cousin~ s~ experience and advice,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"You need not trouble yourself; II can do every thing."&#xD;
"Never mind me. What have you got done ?"&#xD;
"0, 1 haven't ~ommenced yet I"&#xD;
"llavn't commenced, and it now four o'clock! It is&#xD;
high time you had commenced, then. You have your&#xD;
poultry killed, and meats all ready, and conrectionaries all&#xD;
bought?"&#xD;
"0 no. It is time enough to kill the poultry and get&#xD;
the meats ready; and we won't have any confectionaries."&#xD;
"The young ladies have their things all ready, of course."&#xD;
"No. They can soon get their things ready."&#xD;
"These bedsteads and beds must be taken out of all these&#xD;
lower rooms."&#xD;
"Good gracious! And strip my house dry! Never. If&#xD;
they can't eat in a bedroom, they must go without. They&#xD;
can sit in the parlor, and dance in the dining-room, and eat&#xD;
in this bedroom."&#xD;
"It will never do to bring your guests into a bedroom to&#xD;
eat."&#xD;
"I'll never have my house torn upside- down to please&#xD;
young folks."&#xD;
What her relative, with her energy and good taste, and&#xD;

Betsy's working qualities, which were equal to her tongue,&#xD;
when started, could do, was done to get ready. The best&#xD;
was of course but passable; but Piper and Betsy were satis-&#xD;
fied.&#xD;
[All things done that were to be done, Piper and Betsy sat&#xD;
down to wait for their guests.&#xD;
This feeling of waiting for guests was a new jne to Piper&#xD;
and Betsy; and, though both were tired, and sat dowi, they&#xD;
could not stay down, especially Piper. lie would walk to&#xD;
the door, the window, the back-door, call to 0-raudison, and&#xD;
explain for the hundredth time what he must do when "the&#xD;
company came," to keep the servants from seeing that he&#xD;
and Betsy were afraid the "company" would not come. The&#xD;
company, however, did come, all who were invited; and the&#xD;
small, ill-constructed parlor, filled already to choking with&#xD;
half-worn, clumsy furniture, was a perfect jam. As the&#xD;
"party" was given to "the girls," Piper wa~ determined&#xD;
they should have the benefit of it, and made use of every&#xD;
manoeuvre his horse-swapping ingenuity could invent to draw&#xD;
and keep them into notice, an&amp;amp; managed to keep them&#xD;
pinned to the sleeve of some of "the first" young men all&#xD;
the evening. If the young ladies had been left alone, they&#xD;
would have done well enough; for they were not lacking in&#xD;
good sense nor good looks; and though their education was&#xD;
superficial, and their experience in company very limited, it&#xD;
was no fault of theirs, as they had made the most of their&#xD;
opportunities. They, at least three of them, possessed an&#xD;
innate modesty, a woman's modesty and diffidence, which&#xD;
would have saved them from exposure and remark, and would&#xD;
have secured them affectionate regard; for, however much&#xD;
young men may seek the company of young ladies who~e&#xD;
manners are as free as their tongues, they all love ~nd extol&#xD;
female modesty; and, should it extci~ d even to di'ffidenc~ and&#xD;
downright bashfulness, it is greatl~~ preferred to freeness,&#xD;

and brusqueness, its counterpart. Isadore, the youngest&#xD;
daughter-the oldest two were twins-was rather brusque;&#xD;
thought herself talented and witty, and, by a very common&#xD;
error, mistook pertness for talent, and coarseness for wit.&#xD;
She was evidently Piper's '~ pet," and he used his utmost to&#xD;
show her off, and succeeded to perfection. He was happy.&#xD;
He saw everybody laughing, and laughing loud, his standard&#xD;
of enjoyment; for, if people were not happy and enjoying&#xD;
themselves, what would they laugh for? People did n't&#xD;
laugh as heartily as his guests were laughing, if they were&#xD;
not enjoying themselves. What if Betsy and the other&#xD;
"girls" did have an indistinct idea that the laughing was at&#xD;
the. actors, and not at the act? No such impossible suspicion&#xD;
crossed his mind; and, to use a Southernism, lie went it-&#xD;
spread himself! And the more he went it, the more they&#xD;
laughed; and the more they laughed, the more lie went it!&#xD;
If the loud talking and uproari6us laughter-his idea of&#xD;
enjoyment-ceased for a moment, like a lull in a storm,&#xD;
which would occur occasionally, from mere surfeit and ex-&#xD;
haustion, or if spirits cooled, he would call the gentlemen to&#xD;
one side, and steam up with ~randy. The swefl.heads&#xD;
couldn't monopolize that! (he would boast,) and took pains&#xD;
to tell each drinker how much it cost him per 'bottle--" ten&#xD;
bits ;" and got it cheap at that; "two bits" a bottle less&#xD;
than he saw (Jol. Olarkson pay for the "same article."&#xD;
In one of the lulls of the~storm, they hear string, string,&#xD;
string, thrum, thrum, thrum, see, saw, sum, sum, saw, see.&#xD;
What was it? a wood-saw? No. A cornstalk fiddle? No.&#xD;
A gourd fiddle? No. A banjo? No. Then what was&#xD;
The door opened, and there stood old Tony, with an old,&#xD;
cracked fiddle, with three strings; and the company were&#xD;
invited to foot it in the dance to his music.&#xD;
The set was formed, and, from chance, or because none of&#xD;
the gallants wanted to be bored or to be made the butt of the&#xD;

PLAYING FOIl AMUSEMENT.               49&#xD;
others' wit and laughter, "Pet" was left without a partner.&#xD;
This, Piper felt, would never do; for Pet was a famous&#xD;
dancer: it was her forte. Mrs. Bounce, who taught dancing&#xD;
when Pet was a "little bit of a thing," and whose success&#xD;
was a trap-bali or baby-jumper movement, and Mr. Trip-&#xD;
lightly, who taught some years later, and whose success&#xD;
was a certain tripping, which w~s performed by hoisting the&#xD;
dress nearly to the knees, sticking out one foot, and shaking'&#xD;
it, and then leaping off and sticking out the other&#xD;
foot, and&#xD;
shaking that-a dance much admired and practiced by ladies&#xD;
with a pretty leg and ankle and small foot-both declared&#xD;
she was their "best scholar ;" the only hope they had of&#xD;
getting their pay without much haggling and sewing from&#xD;
Piper. With such accomplishments, it would never do for&#xD;
her not to be in the first set; the second might never. come.&#xD;
So he, who knew about as much of Terpsichore as Gilpin&#xD;
did of Latin, en gaged her himself; and then used all his&#xD;
skill to trade her off; but no one wished to "deal." A few&#xD;
thrums of the three strings, a long draw of the bow, and a&#xD;
heavy stamp of the foot, and Old Tony throws back his head,&#xD;
shakes his body, and calls out, "Balance all I" and "went&#xD;
it!" Piper, seeing his man "goino it," and thinking that&#xD;
he knew, as he was the fiddler, and fiddlers ought 'to know,&#xD;
called out to them all to "pitch in," and "went it." A roar&#xD;
of laughter was the answer, and they all "went it !" Here&#xD;
they went, Piper and Pet, bouncing up and down, hjther&#xD;
and back, sidewise and crosswise! The noise and laughter&#xD;
nnd confusion increased: it pleased him; all pleased him&#xD;
except that Pet would n't "shake her foot." He w~uld&#xD;
hunch her, and whisper, "Shake your foot," and, to divert&#xD;
attention, call out, "Go it, boys I" But Pet did n't shake&#xD;
her foot. Growing impatient, h~e whispered, loud enough to&#xD;
be heard by others, "Why don't you shake your foot ?"&#xD;
She whispered back, "There ain't room !" This bothered&#xD;

&#xD;
him. He hated to check the fun; for it was fun,' up to the&#xD;
brim; but Pet must have room to shake her foot; and ,by&#xD;
dint of hallooing and digs in the ribs, he managed to get Old&#xD;
Tony to suspend the swing of his body and head, and stamp&#xD;
of his foot, long enough t6 have room made for Pet to (lance&#xD;
the "trip dance." Her foot was small, and her new shoes&#xD;
fitted neatly, and Piper was delighted. She began, slowly&#xD;
and gracefully at first; grows faster; Old Tony increases&#xD;
the shake of his body'; Pet hoists her dress higher, sticks&#xD;
her foot out farther, and shakes it faster; Old Tony's motion&#xD;
increases; his head, body, arms, and feet are' all in motion;&#xD;
Old Tony increases; the dance increases; his head is ahead;&#xD;
his arms are ahead; his feet have it; his body is ahead;&#xD;
Pet leads the field. Piper is beside himself! Here they go.&#xD;
Pet is still ahead; faster and faster; Piper is wild with&#xD;
delight-triumphant! No lady at Mrs. Corbin's could hold a&#xD;
torch to that! Pet still leads the field; head grows Uizzy;&#xD;
the room whirls; ~lip goes her foot; pop goes a string; down&#xD;
cames Pet; up go her feet; spread goes Piper's nostrils;&#xD;
down comes his nose, and up goes a shout, Iluzza! huzza!&#xD;
Betsy, who, in spite of her disposition to hew down with&#xD;
a sharj~ tongue the social status of the pets of fortune 1;o her&#xD;
own standard, enjoyed a good thing, joined in the laugh,&#xD;
despite the flatted nose and drooping under lip of Piper; and&#xD;
besides, "Pet" was not Betsy's pet.&#xD;
The storm lulled atter awhile, as all storms must, breaking&#xD;
in transient gusts, as the cloud rolled away from Piper's face.&#xD;
A young lawyer, whose presence Piper regarded as an event,&#xD;
was determined to have his laugh out, and was too well-bred&#xD;
to be guilty of the wickedness, the malice aforethought, to&#xD;
laugh in Piper's face, and mock his agony, when others re-&#xD;
strained themseP~es, and knowing Piper's and Pet's weakness&#xD;
upon the subject\ of her musical attainments, to divert atten-&#xD;
tion from , and, amid the noise, to secure impunity to&#xD;
&#xD;
fun, called for music, and led Pet to the piano. Happy hit!&#xD;
Piper was himself again. Pet would have an opportunity to&#xD;
redeem herself! A modest young Doctor, who was fond of&#xD;
good music, and had heard Pet's powers highly extolled by&#xD;
the family, asked for one production after another, of the&#xD;
first masters, but she had never heard of them, and the&#xD;
lawyer, growing impatient for the noise to begin, called out&#xD;
for "her favorite" if she had any, and if not, for any thing&#xD;
so there was sound in it. This was enough; and she struck&#xD;
"Uncle Ned," "Wait for the Wagon," "Dandy Jim," "Camp-&#xD;
town Races," etc., and by the time she got to "John came&#xD;
down the hollow1," Piper was literally frantic with delight.&#xD;
"The eirls" were all gathered around her, and joined in; and&#xD;
Piper, stood without the circle as if surrounding all, and with&#xD;
his face turned up and his voice a pitch higher and louder&#xD;
than the rest, joined in the chorus to the top of hi~ lungs,&#xD;
and, hoisting one foot and arm, would sing out: "Holler,&#xD;
boys, holler-r-r I" Betsy had never seen* him in such ecstasy.&#xD;
The song through, he led Pet in triumph to her seat, and&#xD;
took the' shout that greeted them as the' spontaneous, ir~epres-&#xD;
sible offering to her vocal and instrumental powers; Kd in&#xD;
the exhilaration of the moment uncorked a new bottle,' which&#xD;
he had thought he would be able to save, with a snap of&#xD;
his finger, and "Who cares for a few turnips ?"&#xD;
The d4nking over, a wise look from Piper at Betsy took&#xD;
her ot~t, and disposed "the girls" demurely about the room.&#xD;
And presently, supper being announced, all went into the&#xD;
bed-room to receive their refreshments, and laid into them&#xD;
with a hearty good-will.&#xD;
The "party" broke up with assurances from all that they&#xD;
"had enjoyed4 themselves," which was true to the letter.&#xD;
Piper felt himself and "the girls" to be "in society," and&#xD;
went to bed a happier man than ho had over been before, or&#xD;
has been since.&#xD;

ROBERT and Agnes were assiduous in their childish kttcn~&#xD;
tions to the Hermit, and when he recovercd~so far as tc~ give&#xD;
his assent to their leaving, by the directions of Col. Cla~kson,&#xD;
Mr. Bh~ke placed them on board of a steamboat, and a~ corn-&#xD;
panied them to Bluff City. Their tastes were much the same,&#xD;
and the cast of mind, and mental and moral aspirations of&#xD;
both, were very similar; their appreciation of the pure and&#xD;
beautiful was the same; Agnes was perhaps more impressed&#xD;
with the sense of the sublime and infinite, more spiritucll~o than&#xD;
he; both were fond of book~, but she thought more and read&#xD;
less, and he read more and thought less. Both were fend of&#xD;
old classic history and legends; he to learn a new idea or&#xD;
truth, she to catch a new inspiration. Often in their mental&#xD;
rambles had they joined Horace in his walks over "the plain&#xD;
of fertile Larissa," or through "the Tiburnian groves, and&#xD;
th~ orchards watered by ductile rivulets ;" he pensively&#xD;
thinking of the great dead, and she of the spirit of the place.&#xD;
With these kindred feelings and sentiments, and a doinmon&#xD;

means surprising that an attachment grew up between them,&#xD;
which required nothing but the hardening influence of time&#xD;

had not occurred to the friends of either, and if it had, it&#xD;
would not have been a subj cot of inquietude, as there was no&#xD;
inequality in their stations in life which could oppose a.&#xD;
barrier to their future union, should they in after-life desire&#xD;
it. hence, they were permitted to wander at pleasure in the&#xD;
spacious garden at "Rose Hill," the name of Col. Clarkson' s&#xD;
town residence, and cull the sweet flowers, qr watch the gold&#xD;
fish disport in the artiAcial fountain, or the steamboats ruffle&#xD;
the bosom of the broad river; or sit together of dark, stormy&#xD;
nights, when "Pa" was out with Dr. Floyd and other com-&#xD;
panions, playing for amusement and betting to count the&#xD;
game, and "Ma" in the adjoining room, hushing the fears of&#xD;
the smaller children, or teaching them their prayers; or they&#xD;
would stand, hand in hand, gazing into the darkness without&#xD;
for the storm-god, as he beat against the window, and wailed&#xD;
past with the tempest. At such times neither would speak,&#xD;
but both think and fed. Feel how? Feel as older persons&#xD;
do in looking upon the waterfall, and think of the "eternal&#xD;
flow of its waters," or listening to the never-ceasing dash of&#xD;
the surf to the shore. And wl~at is that? The conscious-&#xD;
ness of the presence of the ruler of the storm and the waters?&#xD;
Perhaps so; but "the man who has said in his heart, 'There&#xD;
is no God,"' feels the same. Robert and Agnes did not&#xD;
moralize on the subject; they were not capable of moralizing.&#xD;
But with eyes fixed and vacant, they would inwardly gaze&#xD;
upward to the Source of the puke and the good ! How beau-&#xD;
tiful the tribute of love which innocence there paid to the&#xD;
great Fountain of love and purity! It was unstudied, un-&#xD;
bought; sweeter than the incense of flowers which earth&#xD;
sends to heaven with the dew of the morning-- the thought&#xD;
of which will come back in after-years, to sweeten sad mem-&#xD;
ories of "hours that were."&#xD;

&#xD;
attended closely to her education; preferring to give form&#xD;
and direction to a mind so delicate and appreciative as her&#xD;
daughter's was, than to intrust such an important and&#xD;
delicate task to indifferent strangers. She knew that sonic-&#xD;
thing more was needed than the mere filling the mind with&#xD;
the knowledge of books. The, mind had to grow, and re-&#xD;
quired havingg as it grew; and, knowing her child better than&#xD;
anybody else could, and knowing better than any one else&#xD;
what she wished her daughter to be, she preferred to do that&#xD;
shaping herself; and hers was really the only hand that could&#xD;
have shaped it to her desires. Anybody can teach the rou~&#xD;
tine prescribed in the books; anybody can make the pupil&#xD;
study a lesson and recite it; but he who would properly&#xD;
shape the mind-would bring out in its proper colors the im-&#xD;
press of the divinity there-must be superior to the book he&#xD;
teaches. - The book is made for the scholar, not the ii~ aster.&#xD;
He who is fully imbued with the genius of music, though&#xD;
his fingers may be so large and heavy that he cannot himself&#xD;
execute the simplest piece, can infuse the spirit of the com-&#xD;
position into the pupil, and send her fingers flying over the&#xD;
keys with ~n inspiration that can. never be caught from the&#xD;
mechanical performer, however artistic his skill. He who&#xD;
feels, can make another feel; a mock sentiment will some-&#xD;
times inspire a real one. He, therefore, who would make the&#xD;
man or woman out of the child, must to a greater or less ex-&#xD;
tent, be either himself what he would make the child, or fully&#xD;
imbued with the sense of the personnel of the character he&#xD;
would make. As well might Powers have taken his chisel&#xD;
and hewn away at the quarry to form the "Greek Slave,"&#xD;
without first having in his mind a clear conception of the&#xD;
model upon which he meant to form it, as for a sculptor of&#xD;
the human mind to undertake to form a character, good or&#xD;
bad, without havbg some fixed purpose as to the shape lie&#xD;
means to give it. Nrs. (Jlarkson in the nursery was what&#xD;
&#xD;
Powers was in the quarry; she knew the texture of the&#xD;
mental granite upon which she had to work, and the temper&#xD;
of the chisel she had to work with, and her heart and head&#xD;
were full of the model of the character she wanted to form.&#xD;
Should such a, sculptor put the chisel to shape lineaments so&#xD;
delicate, fine, and perfect, into a stranger's hands, to deface&#xD;
and spoil as pure a piece of marble as was ever struck from&#xD;
an Italian quarry? Never! She was too true a anotherr, had&#xD;
too high an appreciation of her duties and privileges, to lcave&#xD;
such a sweet task to strangers, however willing or skilled the&#xD;
workman. She felt that nature had done much in forming&#xD;
the physical frame, and a kind Providence more in furnishing&#xD;
a mind of extraordinary beauty and purity, and as it grew,&#xD;
and she saw it shaping itself under her touch to the model,&#xD;
she felt all the pride and pleasure which the artist feels as&#xD;
he sees the rough stone moulding to the perfection of his&#xD;
model. Hence her pleasure was at home. The information&#xD;
which books impart were of course not neglected, but it&#xD;
came in incidentally, and not regarded as the primary object&#xD;
of education; only as an auxiliary-a means to a great end.&#xD;
In this she was not aided by her husband. Col. Clarkson&#xD;
loved his family, was extremely kind to, and fond of all, but&#xD;
he was idolatrously attached to Agnes. And he always&#xD;
seemed to think of her as the beautiful little angel that&#xD;
looked up to him and smiled in his face, as he kneeled by&#xD;
her cradle and bent over her in the first years of his wedded&#xD;
life. If she had been less pure and single-minded as she&#xD;
grew up, his mind would have been awakened from that&#xD;
dream of other years, and he would have bestowed some&#xD;
thought upon her necessary culture. But as it was, she con-&#xD;
tinned innocent and beautiful as in infancy, and the charm&#xD;
had never been broken. For this preservation of infantile&#xD;
loveliness and gentleness, Agnes was in a great measure in-&#xD;
debted to her mother. The time, however, was approaching&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
when the mother felt the necessity of transferring this Itabor&#xD;
'of love to other hands. Twelve months and more had passed&#xD;
since their return to the Bluffs, and Agnes was fast verging&#xD;
to womanhood; and the mother deemed it due to her daughter,&#xD;
relitetant as she was to resign the charge, that she should be&#xD;
sent to some school where she would derive much greater&#xD;
advantages in the mere science of education than could be&#xD;
had at home. But this determination was not arrived at by&#xD;
the mother until she saw the character so well formed., and&#xD;
the mind so far developed, that there was nothing left for the&#xD;
schoolmaster 'to do but to fill the vase with such flowers as&#xD;
could be gathered from the lull of science. Having culti-&#xD;
vated and formed hqr mind thus far, the going ~-to school was&#xD;
bat another step in her own system, and hence, when the&#xD;
proper time came for it to' be taken, she was prepared for it.&#xD;
Not so, however, with the father. He was therefore' aroused&#xD;
as if from a dream, when, one afternoon in autumn, as they&#xD;
sat in the broad piazza, the sun flinging a gorgeous flood of&#xD;
light into the lap of the beautiful landscape spread out before&#xD;
the city, she approached him and said:&#xD;
"It is time we thought of sending Agnes to school."&#xD;
He turned to look at her, reading at the other end of the&#xD;
gallery; and as he looked, she grew, grew, grew into a&#xD;
woman before hini! He had only thought of her as a child;&#xD;
the sweet babe that smiled on him fifteen years ago, in the&#xD;
morning of life; the child that first lisped to him with baby&#xD;
breath, "Papa I" and taught him how dear it ~as to have&#xD;
some helpless thing to protect. His other children grew up&#xD;
like those of other people, and he formed plans for them;&#xD;
thought of what was proper to be done with and for theni,&#xD;
when they grew up to manhood. But Agnes, "little Agues,"&#xD;
was his first-born babe; and though fifteen years had sprin-&#xD;
kled his head and chin with gray, she was still his first-born,&#xD;
his babe, his "little Agnes ;" and so long as she was "little&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT,                 57&#xD;
Agnes" he could not grow old: his heart was still young,&#xD;
and in the cradle of "little Agnes " and his wife, who was&#xD;
Mrs. Clarkson to the world, was Amy to him; the Amy of&#xD;
younger years; the Amy he used to attend in the pleasant&#xD;
walks, whirl with in the dance, and. kneel with in the same&#xD;
pew at church, and recite the prayers from the same book;&#xD;
the Amy he led to the altar, and vowed to love, cherish, and&#xD;
protect, when all was youth an~1 hope, light, and life, and&#xD;
love. How long it seemed, as he looked back! As he&#xD;
looked, she was "little Agnes" no longer. There she was,&#xD;
nearly a woman, and he passed the meridian of life! The&#xD;
heart stood still, and trembled upon the verge before it mus-&#xD;
tered courage to leap the gap of years. Fifteen years!&#xD;
ITow quickly they had passed, and how silently and surely&#xD;
they had borne him away from the morning of his life!&#xD;
While "little Agnes" wa~ "little Agnes," it w~s ever pre-&#xD;
sent; but now that she was no longer "little Agnes," and&#xD;
the dear scenes of the past, hallowed by a thousand sweet&#xD;
associations, were receding, receding, still receding, and&#xD;
memory, reaching out her withered arm in vain to stay them,&#xD;
like the child that stands upon the bank of the stream, and&#xD;
cries, "B ring back my flowers," he could have sat himself&#xD;
down and wept.&#xD;
He walked the gallery to and fro for some time in silence.&#xD;
How busy was memory spreading out and adjusting before&#xD;
him the days and the years gone by! He at last turned and&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"You are right, Amy. Strange I had not thought&#xD;
of it before. I have never thought of her as other than&#xD;
our child, our first-born; and you must excuse me if the&#xD;
surprise, the new feeling that she is no longer a cl~ild, and is&#xD;
soon to be our successor in scenes dear to memory, made me&#xD;
slow in giving you an answer. The feeling is new, and pain-&#xD;
ful as new; newer even, than the tinsel and folly of some&#xD;

&#xD;
of our friends, and without the glitter and the power to&#xD;
please." lie resumed his walk, stopped, and said:&#xD;
"When we were married, sixteen years ago, I had a&#xD;
laudable ambition for distinction in my profession, and the&#xD;
fairest of prospects, equal, if not superior to that of any of&#xD;
my acquaintances; and here, at the age of forty-one, I stand,&#xD;
humiliated before the wife I have disappointed! IDo nut say&#xD;
deceived! No, thank God! I have not acted deceptively!&#xD;
I have foolishly hoped that the child would always be a&#xD;
child; and keep me young; keep me at the starting-point of&#xD;
life, where I could commence anew the race of life, when-&#xD;
ever it suited me to shake loose from my lethargy, brought&#xD;
on by luxury and idleness, and which has made me as un-&#xD;
productive ~s the 'fat weed that rots on Lethe's wharf!'"&#xD;
Mrs. Clarkson was alarmed. She was a woman of fine&#xD;
sense, and still finer qualities: one at whom ~a stranger would&#xD;
turn to look, if passed in a crowd. She spoke but few words,&#xD;
and they were to the point. The course of life her husband&#xD;
had chosen to pursue, had been a matter of deep regret; and&#xD;
she had done all she could, in the earlier part of her married&#xD;
life, to give it a different direction ;and when her efforts&#xD;
proved vain, she applied her energies to avoid the Jiazards&#xD;
and evils with which such a life was beset. her good sense&#xD;
told her that the worst thing to fear, at his time of life, sur-&#xD;
rounded by temptation and danger as he was, was ~ernorse.&#xD;
She saw him standing upon a precipice; and into the deep,&#xD;
dark gulf beyond, she would not permit herself to look.&#xD;
iRemorse was all that was needed to make him leap headlong&#xD;
into it. It was too late for him to gather up what sixteen&#xD;
years of luxury and dissipation in the prime and vigor of&#xD;
life had scattered. Sixteen years of total obliviousness to a&#xD;
profession well learned, it is true, but never practh~ed, had&#xD;
sped by, carrying with them the profession; and one could&#xD;
'no more be recalled than the other; and that incentive to&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.                59&#xD;
exertion whicl~i could inspire a resolution to begin anew, was&#xD;
wanting. Better, therefore, that he should continue as he&#xD;
was, the careless, idle ,man of pleasure, and of the world,&#xD;
than something worse. Better drink on, as a matter of good&#xD;
cheer, than drink to drown memory; better bet to count the&#xD;
game, than to win back his youth and youthful hopes and&#xD;
aspirations. She saw the danger, and threw herself, with all&#xD;
a woman's fortitude, between him and the great abyss&#xD;
beyond. She would persuade him that his life had not been&#xD;
barren.&#xD;
"You have made me happy, at least," she said. He kissed&#xD;
her forehead. "That was one object of your ambition.&#xD;
You have not only~not deceived, but you have not disap-&#xD;
pointed me. Success in yoar profession would only have&#xD;
given wealth, which we did not need; and political success,&#xD;
once an object of ambition with you, was never desired by&#xD;
me. Its laurels are but a crown of thorns to the wearer.&#xD;
One would have wor~i out your frame, to aectunulate what&#xD;
we did not need, an4 the other would have worn out your&#xD;
morals, for that whicl~ would have supplanted your wife and&#xD;
children in your affections. Then, my dear husband, as you&#xD;
love mc, do not regret the past; do not so much as look at&#xD;
it !" And she looked into his fa.ce with an anxious, pleading&#xD;
look, that was peculiar to her. It was not a care-worn, sad,&#xD;
or melancholy look, but a blending of them all; such as&#xD;
may be seen in - the face of "Mary," in the picture of the&#xD;
Crucifixion, where she leans upon the shoulder of John,&#xD;
"the beloved disciple," and looks anxiously into the face of&#xD;
her Saviour, as he is about being nailed to the cross. Mr.&#xD;
Clarkson placed his arm over her shoulder, drew her hand&#xD;
around him, and walked the gallery back and fro for a long&#xD;
while in silence, and finally took his hat and went down&#xD;
town. She looked after him with a swelling, beating heart.&#xD;

HE did not return to tea. Night came on, and he still&#xD;
did not come. The children were put to' bed, and went to&#xD;
sleep; he still had not come. She took up her prayer-book,&#xD;
and then her Bible, and read; laid them down, walked to the&#xD;
window and door, and looked; but he still had not come.&#xD;
She went out and walked the gallery, and listened. list!&#xD;
She hears a footstep; it is his! 11cr heart beats: she can&#xD;
scarcely hear the walking. It comes nearer; it is steady.&#xD;
Thank God! he is sober, and her fears are groundless. No;&#xD;
she is mistaken: the step passes the gate, and, goes on. She&#xD;
walks to the gate, and leans upon it, and looks down the&#xD;
street. All is still. She returns and walks the gallery. 0,&#xD;
how her heart aches! Something must be the matter: he&#xD;
must be ill! and gets her bonnet, determined to go in search&#xD;
of him: but, pshaw! why think so? Has he not remained&#xD;
out later than this many a night before? She lays aside her&#xD;
bonnet, takes up her book, and tries again to read; but the&#xD;
letter~ swim before her, and she reads without knowing what&#xD;
she reads. She looks at 'the children; they are comfort-&#xD;
able; looks out at the servants' hall ;~all is still there; they&#xD;
have gone to bed, and are asleep. The lights in the Louses&#xD;
of the neighbors around are all extinguished, and the in-&#xD;
mates asleep; the moon has sunk far to the west, and seems&#xD;
preparing for repose in the lap of the landscape which shone&#xD;

so lovely in the soft sunlight of the afternoon, and still he&#xD;
had not come. Tho tramp of many feet is at last heard.&#xD;
What can it mean? (Jan he be killed, and they bearing his&#xD;
body to her? They approach nearer, open the gate, and,&#xD;
tramp along the gravel walk. Her limbs tremble; she is un-&#xD;
able to move; they step upon the gallery; she hears his&#xD;
voice! Then he is not dead! She opens the door, and&#xD;
those who are supporting him let go, and, with a hiccough, he&#xD;
reels, and falls into her arms. She utters no reproaches to&#xD;
him, nor to the companions of his revel, but, with their&#xD;
assistance, conveys him to bed, where he sleeps off his&#xD;
debauch.&#xD;
He awoke next day as all newly-made drunkards do, with&#xD;
a severe pain in the head, and bodily prostration, and deeply&#xD;
mortified, and formed a mental resolve never to be guilty of&#xD;
such excess again, and lays all the blame on the brandy,&#xD;
avowing that he had not drunk more than upon previous&#xD;
occasions, when he had, not felt it. This was partly true;&#xD;
for the excited state of his mind, when he began to drink,&#xD;
gave a double power to the liquor. For several days after,&#xD;
he avoided temptation, and abstained from cards and brandy.&#xD;
During that time, the sending of Agnes to school was fully&#xD;
diseu~sed, and a school selected, which was one of the oldest&#xD;
and best-endowed in the Union.&#xD;
At the earnest request of Agnes, backed by the wishes of&#xD;
Mrs. Clarkson, who wished to draw her husband as far as&#xD;
possible from the. influence of the clubs, it was agreed that&#xD;
the time needed in preparing Agnes for school should be&#xD;
spent at the plantation, a new residence having been erected&#xD;
in place of the one burned down. As soon as it was deter-&#xD;
mined upon, Agnes approached her father, and asked:&#xD;
"Pa, will you please give n~e two hundred and fifty&#xD;
dollars, and not ask what want with it ?"&#xD;
"Why, that is a strange request, my daughter."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8172-00000032"/>&#xD;
PLAYING FOR A. TISEMENT.&#xD;
Well, never mind, dear papa; will you give me the&#xD;
money ?"&#xD;
"Yes, if you say so. Thinking of your old gray-haired&#xD;
friend at the Bend, eh ?"&#xD;
"Thank you, my father;" and she threw her arms&#xD;
around his neck, and kissed him.&#xD;
It was determined that they would not return until in the&#xD;
ensuing fall; and it took some ten days or two weeks in&#xD;
making preparations to leave for the plantation. This thing&#xD;
was to be attended to, and the shopping to be done; and&#xD;
Agnes had her two hundred and fifty dollars to spend; a&#xD;
novelty to her, as she had never made purchases or been in&#xD;
trading-shops before. Things all done, and purchases made,&#xD;
they left for the "Bend," and found all to their liking.&#xD;
A day or two after their arrival, Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson,&#xD;
in an evening walk, visited the negro burying-ground, and&#xD;
were surprised and pleased to see a neat little paling fence&#xD;
around the grave of good old Aunt Fanny, and; standing at&#xD;
the head of the grave a handsome tombstone, with the fol-&#xD;
lowing inscription upon it:&#xD;
SACRED TO THE MEMORY&#xD;

The secret of th~ two hundred and fifty dollars was ex-&#xD;
plained.&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
The Hermit had resumed his solitary habits, as silent and&#xD;
impenetrable as ever. There Agnes found him~ and joined&#xD;
again in his walks. From his abstraction, she feared that&#xD;
she had lost her place in his affections; that his heart had&#xD;
only opened to close more tightly. He noticed her anxiety,&#xD;
and reassured her, by pressing his lips to her forehead; the&#xD;
first time he had offered an endearment of the kind. It was&#xD;
something for her to carry with her to school, and to recall,&#xD;
when, worried with study, she should steal away from her&#xD;
companions and her books, to think of home and friends,&#xD;
and the strange, mysterious being who had taken such pos-&#xD;
session. of her heart and imagination, and in whom she had&#xD;
inspired an interest for herself as extraordinary as it was&#xD;
deep and unexpected; an interest which made him peril life,&#xD;
and endure the most excruciating bodily suffering, to rescue&#xD;
her from a most awful death; a danger fr6m which her own&#xD;
parents, dearly as they loved her, shrank appalled.&#xD;
The day of her departure soon came, and the negroes all&#xD;
gathered at the house, to tell her "good-bye ;" and their un-&#xD;
couth expressions of sorrow, though affecting, were as gro-&#xD;
tesque as they were heartfelt. The parting from her mother&#xD;
was the hardest trial to both. Although Mrs. Clarkson had&#xD;
been the first to propose her leaving for school, when the day&#xD;
of separation came, she felt it to be more than she could&#xD;
bear; and nothing but a strong sense of duty nerved her to.&#xD;
it. In her cradle she had watched her infancy, nursed and&#xD;
nurtured her, and guided her steps to the verge of woman-&#xD;
hood; and then to give her to the direction of another, was&#xD;
a trial her woman~s heart could not think of with dry eyes.&#xD;
She folded the sweet, trusting child to her bosom, pressed&#xD;
her long and hard, sighed deeply, turne~i, and, catching hold&#xD;
of the door, saved herself from 4lhing. She threw herself&#xD;
upon the bed, buried her face in her hands, and lay motion-&#xD;
less as death, without a word, without a tear, without a sob I&#xD;

&#xD;
How, long she had lain in that condition, she did not know,&#xD;
when she felt a little soft arm steal gently around her ncck,&#xD;
and her little son of eight years laid his head beside hers,&#xD;
and wept. His affection for his mother was beautiful and&#xD;
simple; and having seen her retreat to her room, and his&#xD;
own cry ended, he went silently into his mother's roomy and,&#xD;
after waiting until he could stand it no longer, crawled&#xD;
quietly up beside her, and put his little arm around her neck,&#xD;
and nestled his head down beside hers. This touching ex-&#xD;
pression of sympathy from her child had the effect to start&#xD;
the flow of tears, and relieved the oppression about the heart.&#xD;
When she arose, the boat was out of sight.&#xD;
When placed aboard f the boat, Agnes took her stand&#xD;
where she could see her h me, and that of her friend, dear as&#xD;
home. As far as she coul see the Hermit, he was walking up&#xD;
and down his old path alo g the river bank. "How lo~ng,"&#xD;
she asked herself, "before II shall again join him? how long&#xD;
before I shall see my dear, dear mother ?" And as the Bend&#xD;
and loved ones were cbs d to view, she retired to her state-&#xD;
room, to weep away the first sad hours of separation.&#xD;
Dr. Floyd had requested Col. Clarkson to take charge of&#xD;
Robert Hamilton, and leave him at college; and when the&#xD;
Colonel and Agnes got aboard of the boat, they found Robert&#xD;
on board. As Clarkson had no acquaintances on the boat,&#xD;
for a day or so he spent his time with Robert and Agnes, and&#xD;
took little or no notice of the game, which never seemed to&#xD;
cease, d~y nor night. A gentleman of his agreeable manners&#xD;
could not be on a boat long without making acquaintances,&#xD;
and he was much pleased with a very modest, pleasant ac-&#xD;
quaintance he made on the second day after getting aboard.&#xD;
The efforts of his new acquaintance, who was himself a father,&#xD;
and on his way to visit his only daughter at school, so he&#xD;
said, to wean his thoughts from painful channels, were so&#xD;
well timed and unobtrusive as to gain Clarkson's regard, and&#xD;
&#xD;
awaken a disposition to extend the acquaintance. They&#xD;
exchanged cards, and Clarkson was pleased to find him a&#xD;
member of a large and respectable commission house in New&#xD;
Orbeans-a silent partner. Like Clarkson, he had not taken&#xD;
a hand in the game, though often solicited to do so. He&#xD;
seemed to know every body on board, and all seemed to know&#xD;
him; and his declining to join in the game was more from an&#xD;
indisposition to play at the time, than any scruple of con-&#xD;
science. He took occasion to let Cob. Clarkson know that he&#xD;
sometimes, played for amusement, but only for amusement,&#xD;
and bet to count the game; but abhorred the vice of gam-&#xD;
bling. It so changed, either by design or accident, that one&#xD;
afternoon a game could not be made up without Cob. Clarkson&#xD;
and his new friend would take a hand; and as time seemed to&#xD;
hang heavily with them, they joined in the game. All the&#xD;
players were severe in their condemnation of gamblers.......pro&#xD;
fessional blackbegs-b~it all bet, and bet high. The game&#xD;
soon became deeply interesting, and Col. Qlarkson was so&#xD;
much absorbed by it, that when notified by the Captain that&#xD;
supper was on the table, he got Robert to attend Agnes to&#xD;
the table, and continued the game. Supper was eaten and&#xD;
the table cleared away, and the game still continued; the&#xD;
passengers one by one went to bed, and Agnes waited in vain&#xD;
for her rather's accustomed "good-night:" the game still con-&#xD;
tinued. She sat down, a solitary watcher, in the door of the&#xD;
ladies' cabin. Seconds lengthened into minutes, and minutes&#xD;
into hours, and her father did not come to bid her good-night.&#xD;
She knew he was excited more than common; he talked loud,,&#xD;
and quick, and angry, and sometimes swore; it was the first&#xD;
time she had ever heard him swear, and at dead of night and&#xD;
in her anxious state of mind, it sounded doubly horrible,&#xD;
doubly blasphemous! She could stand it no longer, and,&#xD;
moved by an impulse she could not control, and a feeling she&#xD;
did not stop to analyze, she walked down the cabin; past the&#xD;

long row of sleepers, to the card-table, took hold of the cards&#xD;
in her father's hand, and looked him imploringly in the face.&#xD;
His first glance at her was one of stern defiance and rebuke;&#xD;
but, there was a charm, a halo about the face of the angelic&#xD;
girl, as she looked at him with a volume of unspoken prayers&#xD;
and entreaties, that overcame him, and his look softened; he&#xD;
yielded the cards, rose, and suffered her to lead him to his&#xD;
state-room, where he kissed her and retired.&#xD;
Her vigils had not been all alone, as she supposed.&#xD;
Robert had watched, unseen, from his own room, the progress&#xD;
of the game, with little if any less interest than Agnes her-&#xD;
self, and saw her, like some fairy spirit of love, move down&#xD;
the long, dimly lighted cabin, and blessed her. As she&#xD;
passed to her room, he whispered a soft "good-night," that&#xD;
lightened the dreams of the dear girl's anxious heart.&#xD;
Col. Clarkson awoke the next morning to a full conscious-&#xD;
ness of his folly. And to the mortification of having pained&#xD;
a daughter he would give his right arm to shield from harm,&#xD;
he found that in betting to count the game, he had counted&#xD;
to a; parcel of gambling sharks about eight thousand dollars;&#xD;
and, but for the timely interference of his daughter, he might&#xD;
have beggared himself and her. He felt the pecuniary loss&#xD;
the more, as 1~ie had drawn the money from his merchant,&#xD;
upon the .fai ~t of his crop, intending, after purchasing his&#xD;
plantation supplies and paying Agnes's school-bill, to invest&#xD;
the balance iii negroc~s, while in Virginia; now he would be&#xD;
compelled to ~ubmit to a heavy discount, to raise in Louisville&#xD;
the funds rec~uired to meet the demands of his plantation,&#xD;
and defray his and his daughter's expenses. When, there-&#xD;
fore, he saluted Agnes in the morning, he was a sadder, and,&#xD;
to a limited extent at least, a better man. Noticing that&#xD;
Agnes was about to speak, he interrupted her:&#xD;
~C1 know what you would say, my daughter, and I deserve&#xD;
more than you would say, but I cannot bear it now."&#xD;
&#xD;
67&#xD;
&#xD;
"I was not going to say any thing bad, Pa."&#xD;
"Well, what did you i~rish to say, my child ?"&#xD;
"0 Pa! .1 never heard you Swear before !" and leaned&#xD;
weeping upon his shoulder.&#xD;
"And you shall never hear me again, my darling child."&#xD;
Brushing away the tears that gathered fast to his eyes, he&#xD;
turned and walked away. It was the last card he played,&#xD;
and the last night's sleep she lost on his account during th~&#xD;
remainder of their journey.&#xD;
Agnes was so fortunate as to meet at school Alice St. Cloud,&#xD;
the only daughter of a widowed mother, a resident of Bluff&#xD;
City, but who was at that time staying near her daughter&#xD;
while at school, having no particular tie at home. Mrs. St.&#xD;
Cloud was a lady of great force of character, and of high&#xD;
moral worth, and Alice was as pure in heart as she was&#xD;
faultless in face. She was a year or so older than Agnes,&#xD;
but only in years. She was small in stature, but perfect in&#xD;
shape; her complexion was a clear, transparent white, and&#xD;
looked like wax-work; her hair was long and black, and&#xD;
glossy as the raven's wing, and her eyes were black and clear&#xD;
as glass, and looked as if set in a snow-heap. She was as in-&#xD;
nocent, unaffected, and happy as a child. To see her was to&#xD;
love her; to know her was to idolize. She was not deficient&#xD;
in any thing, but never studied; no one expected her to&#xD;
study. she never knew a lesson; no one expected her to:&#xD;
she never got a bad mark at school; no one expected her to:&#xD;
she never did any thing right, and yet she could do nothing&#xD;
wrong; if any thing wrong was done, and it was discovered&#xD;
that Alice did it, it was all right. She loved everybody and&#xD;
every thing, and everybody loved her in return. She was&#xD;
guileless as an infant, and her motion was the very personifica&#xD;
tion of grace itself.&#xD;
As the two young ladies were from the same place, it was&#xD;
an easy matter to grant Col. Clarkson's request that they&#xD;

should be permitted to occupy a room together, and to see as&#xD;
much of Mrs. St. Cloud, who had tgken lodgings at a private&#xD;
house with a view of making it "h me" until her daughter's&#xD;
education was finished, as was cons stent with the rules of&#xD;
the school, but to visit no one else. The good fortune of&#xD;
Agnes in meeting such friends at se ool, lifted from his heart&#xD;
a load of anxiety.&#xD;
The days passed wearily enough (vith Mrs. Clarkson, wait--&#xD;
ing her husband's return. When the time came for her&#xD;
to expect him home, she would sit upon the gallery step, and&#xD;
look until her eyes grew weary and .dim. Her little son&#xD;
would seat himself beside her, and, while she gazed steadfastly&#xD;
up the river, he gazed steadfastly into her face ; the two&#xD;
forming a life-picture none but a Raphael could trace. One&#xD;
evening, when she had, been looking longer than usual, and&#xD;
would run her hand from time to time across her eyes to&#xD;
brighten them, or remove the gathering film, the darling&#xD;
little fellow, with the sweetest niiivet6 possible, planted his&#xD;
elbow upon his knee, and, resting his chin in his hand, said :&#xD;
"You go in the house, dear Mamma, and rest your sweet&#xD;
eyes, and I'll stay here and watch for Pa."&#xD;
The mother put her arm around him, and rested her chin&#xD;
on his head, and suffered the big, warm tears to stand and&#xD;
smoke upon her cheek, a sweet incense fresh from the heart&#xD;
to Heaven, in gratitude for two such children.&#xD;
Col. Clarkson's return, and the favorable report from&#xD;
Agnes, relieved much of the mother's anxiety. And his free&#xD;
and full confession of his great folly-he would not call it&#xD;
otherwise-lightened the grief which such a folly would&#xD;
naturally enough occasion. The loss of the money was a&#xD;
sufficient excuse for her to urge their remaining upon the&#xD;
plantation the balance of the season. The careless, do-&#xD;
nothing habits of his neighbors, most of whom were his&#xD;
equals in natural and acquired attainments, being men of&#xD;

CHAPTER VIII.&#xD;
The worhi 's all title-page; there's no contents.&#xD;
YOUNG.&#xD;
AFTER Clarkson's return to Bluff City early in the spring,&#xD;
he joined some friends in a visit to New Orleans. He took&#xD;
passage upon the steamer Belle Creole, under the conimand&#xD;
of a loud-talking, high-living, card-playing Captain, who was&#xD;
as generous in his feelings as he was loose in his morals, and&#xD;
who, notwithstanding his dissolute habits, was one of the&#xD;
most popular Captains on the river; with all classes, men,&#xD;
women, and children, married auc single; though his love&#xD;
of wine, cards, and women, was as notorious as his boat was&#xD;
popular. Every comfort and lux ry was provided the pas-&#xD;
sengers, and a trip to New Orlean lost half its pleasure if&#xD;
taken in any other than this popu ar steamer. The playing&#xD;
on board was incessant; the card- ables wore never vacant;&#xD;
no other amusement was thought of, except perhaps a dance&#xD;
on the part of the younger passengers at night, to the music&#xD;
of a splendid brass-band, hired by the Captain for the season.&#xD;
Among the older menit was play, play, play. It was play&#xD;
in the morning, play in the evening, play at night, play all&#xD;
night, or nearly so, and bet, bet, bet. But no gambling!&#xD;
If a stranger was introduced and "took a hand," and it was&#xD;
suspected that he played for money and bet to win, though&#xD;
his bets were not half so hirge as others, they soon "froze&#xD;
him out" and cut his acquaintance. The playing was nothing,&#xD;
&#xD;
71&#xD;
the betting was nothing, the Winning and losing were nothing;&#xD;
one could play as mush as he pleased, 'bet as much as he&#xD;
pleased, win and lose as much as he pleased, but he must do&#xD;
it for the love of it; that was not gambling , not immoral!&#xD;
It did not exclude him from good society; it~&#xD;
was a fair mark&#xD;
of a gentleman, an aliiiost indispensable passport to their&#xD;
society; and they held 'the keys to the "best society" at&#xD;
home; were controllers of business, made and unmade alder-&#xD;
men, and manufactured public Opinion; but let him use the&#xD;
game for its legitimate purpose-the purpose for which it&#xD;
was invented-to win money, and as soon as he. was detected,&#xD;
he fell under the ban, though his winnings or losings were&#xD;
not one-tenth part of theirs. The playing went on, and&#xD;
Captain, Clerk, Pilots, iVilate, and deck-hands were all in-&#xD;
terested, and many of the officers took hands. Those of the&#xD;
passengers who did not take hands, stood around and looked&#xD;
on. No gambling, but the highest sort of bettino~! No note&#xD;
was taken of time; the boat would stop, but no one knew it;&#xD;
would start, on again, but no one knew it. The Captain&#xD;
mlo'&#xD;
0ht walk, or turn toward the bow and look, it was not&#xD;
noticed. The bell rings, dong, dong; no one hears it. ~A&#xD;
strange bell rings, dong, dong, but no one hears it. A tre-&#xD;
mendous crash! The tables and players are upset! The&#xD;
women scream, and all run out to learn the cause of~ the crash.&#xD;
The Belle Creole had come in collision with the passenger&#xD;
steamer "Bosphorus," and ran her bow into the hull of the&#xD;
latter, sinking her immediately, drowning some hundred or&#xD;
more of her passengers and crew; the result of cards and&#xD;
brandy! Every effort was made by the "Belle Creoh~" and&#xD;
her crew to save the drowning passengers of the ill-fated&#xD;
vessel, and a number were picked up from the water.&#xD;
Frank Vaughan, who was aboar&amp;amp; of the "Belle Creole"-&#xD;
but, to his honor be it said, participated to a very limited ex-&#xD;
tent in the game, only taking an absent player's hand at&#xD;

times-saw a gentleman who had been saved from the wreck&#xD;
of the "Bosphorus," dripping with water and shivering with&#xD;
cold, near the rear stove. The stranger was in undress&#xD;
military suit, and possessed- a handsome person, sported a&#xD;
moustache, had a foreign accent, and was about Frank's size.&#xD;
Whether prompted by a generous impulse, or by the unfor-&#xD;
tunate man's good looks and military air-Frank was fond of&#xD;
military men-he tendered him the use of his wardrobe and&#xD;
purse.&#xD;
"Ah, me une grande unfortunate! Me tank you," said&#xD;
the stranger; and drawing a wet card from his vest-pocket,&#xD;
handed it to Frank. What was the latter's astonishment&#xD;
and delight to read, "Don John de Castro de Navidad I"&#xD;
Here was a prize! the live son of a live Duke! Frank was in&#xD;
ecstasies. He forced the Duke to share his purse and wear&#xD;
his best suit, which fitted neatly. itt was soon noised over&#xD;
the b6at that Frank Vaughan had picked up a live Duke out&#xD;
of the water; and the excitement and desire to see him was&#xD;
as great as if he had been a mermaid or the sea-horse. The&#xD;
ladies were especially excited and eager to see him. The&#xD;
anxiety of mothers with marriageable daughters, Mrs.&#xD;
Corbin in particular, was excruciating~&#xD;
Frank learned from Don John that he was bearer of dispatches&#xD;
from the ~-overnment of Mexico to that of* the United States,&#xD;
and was on his way to Washington when the sad accident&#xD;
happened which secured him the pleasure of Frank's ac-&#xD;
quaintance, [Frank bowed,] and that all his baggage, con-&#xD;
taining his dispatches, letters of credit, and money, was lost.&#xD;
Frank ran his hand into his pocket, pulled out his pocket-&#xD;
book, and pressed -the Duke to take it. But no; he was&#xD;
modest; w~uld only take what would serve his present pur-&#xD;
pose, which Frank thought was very little, but which, if&#xD;
given to a beggar in rags, would have been thought by&#xD;
him enormous. Frank was the envy of the whole boat, and,&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.                 73&#xD;
in the estimation of the ladies, was second only to Don John&#xD;
himself. He grew in his own estimation, as well as in that&#xD;
of others. The other young men, seeing the Duke using&#xD;
Frank's money, and wearing his clothes, could have thrown&#xD;
the latter overboard, from pure envy.&#xD;
When the company arrived in New Orleans, a distin..&#xD;
gushed officer of the United States Army was holding his&#xD;
levee at the St. Charles, and Clarkson and his friends had of&#xD;
Course to pay their respects to him. There was a large and&#xD;
rather distingu6 company present, and Frank's heart beat&#xD;
with proud emotions as he announced, and was about to intro-&#xD;
duce to the officer, Don John de Castro de Navidad. At the&#xD;
apnounceinent, the officer turned, and the young Duke&#xD;
rushed forward, and, seizing him by the hand, said, with his&#xD;
eye sparkling with enthusiasm:&#xD;
"Me no need te introduction to te prave man, te prave&#xD;
soltier! Me see him in te battle! Me see him tare, mit his&#xD;
sword gleaming' in te sun, and his hair streaming' in te win',&#xD;
and he say to te soldier, 'Come on; tish ish te way to victory,'&#xD;
and not, 'Tat ish te way to victory!' Ali, sare, me receive une&#xD;
pad wound tere! Me never recover ;" putting his hand to&#xD;
his breast, to mark the place of the wound.&#xD;
"Ah, my dear sir, I am glad to see you," said the o~cer,&#xD;
shaking him warmly by the hand, and flattered by the deli-&#xD;
cate compliment. "Ii recollect, now that you mention it,&#xD;
of hearing that a son - of the Duke de Castro fell, danger-&#xD;
ously wounded, at the head of his column, when gallantly&#xD;
leading it into action; and, now that I see you, I recognize&#xD;
you as the same. Allow me to sympathize with you, and&#xD;
hope that your wound is not so serious ~syou apprehend."&#xD;
"Me tank you, sare; me tank you; ~ut me no recover,"&#xD;
putting his hand again to his wound. "Ah, me meet une&#xD;
grande ac~iden'! Te poat sink, and me lose all me tis~&#xD;

patch to Yashington, and when inc return to me Govermen,&#xD;
me pe pehead."&#xD;
"Impossible, sir! Your Government cannot be so cruel!&#xD;
I am acquainted with your- chief magistrate, and with the&#xD;
general in command; and I will write and explain what has&#xD;
occurred; and if the President should not listen to me, the&#xD;
General will; and I will interest him in your behalf. And,&#xD;
in the meantime, you must not think of travelling in your&#xD;
present feeble health; and I insist upon your going tfo my&#xD;
country - seat, and remaining until you recover from the&#xD;
effect of your accident. Important business* engagements&#xD;
will prevent inc from attending you, but you will receive a&#xD;
hearty welcome, and must make yourself at home."&#xD;
"Tank you, sare; tank you. Put me Govermen' no like&#xD;
your Govermen'; me government' no take excuse. Pui~ me&#xD;
accep' your hospital."&#xD;
(CAllow me to shake hands with you," said an old volun-&#xD;
teer soldier, who had fought in the wars, waking up, and e~-&#xD;
tending his Ihand. "I recollect you perfectly. I saw you&#xD;
when you fell."&#xD;
me hones' fren'; me take une trink mit you. Te&#xD;
prave soldier make te prave officare."&#xD;
At all this Frank was nearly beside himself. The only&#xD;
drawback was the fear it inspired that the shadow of the&#xD;
Duke might fall upon some one else. But, then, was he not&#xD;
wearing his cloak, and using his money? He was-all saw&#xD;
that-and making as if he was at home with both, just as a&#xD;
Duke ought. His fears were groundless; for the Duke had&#xD;
taken quite a liking to him, and accepted him as his com-&#xD;
panion in all his walks and rides about the city, and visits to&#xD;
the theatres and other places of amusSment and fashionable&#xD;
resort; and took pains upon all public occasions to recognize&#xD;
him as hi~ friend, and openly expressed his gratitude for the&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING    FOR AMUSEMENT.              75&#xD;
favors received. At each expression of the sort, Prank&#xD;
would run his hand deeper into his pocket for his purse, and&#xD;
press it on the Duke. Of course be could not think of&#xD;
doing less than pay for all the tickets, omnibus hire, hotel&#xD;
bills, and furnish money for the Duke to lose at cards; for the&#xD;
Duke had as good a right to lose money at cards as Col. Clark-&#xD;
son, Dr. Floyd, and others; and if he expected to visit Bluff&#xD;
City, and enjoy the advantage of their society, he must take&#xD;
a lesson or twb before he came.&#xD;
In IP'rank's laudable effort to monopolize the wants and&#xD;
extravagances of the Duke, he had a dangerous rival in Mrs.&#xD;
Corbin. As these favors of the Duke were in the market,&#xD;
she determined to bid high-make a desperate cast of the&#xD;
die. At one time a neat, little, sweetly perfumed note was&#xD;
placed in the Duke's hand:&#xD;
"The compliments of Mrs. and Miss Corbin. Mrs~ C.&#xD;
would be pleased to have the pleasure of the Duke's com-&#xD;
pany in a ride to Lafayette Square, at three o'clock P. M.,&#xD;
in her pVivate carriage."&#xD;
There were pretty cupids all over the note-paper. At&#xD;
another tune, the ladies desired his company in a game of&#xD;
whist;" at another time, to the Opera, in a "private box."&#xD;
And Miss Clara went so far as to try her splendid diamond&#xD;
ring on his soft, white, handsomely4apered finger. It fitted&#xD;
so well, and graced the aristocratically small haid so much,&#xD;
that it was left there. His jewelry, except his ducal ring,&#xD;
which he never wore, had been lost with his dispatches; ar~d&#xD;
but for his temporary poverty, which he never knew un~il&#xD;
that moment what it was to regret, it would have afforded&#xD;
him the most exquisite pleasure of his life to exchange&#xD;
diamonds with her. She was delighted; would have given&#xD;
a whole mine of diamonds for another such a speech. Mrs.&#xD;
Corbii~ began to feel strong in her position. The Duke&#xD;
would not wear Clara's ring under such circumstances, if he&#xD;

was not pleased with her! His attentions, too, were d e-&#xD;
cidedly marked! Frank grew more and ,more uneasy. He&#xD;
saw that it was useless competing with a woman, and such a&#xD;
woman as Mrs. Corbin, who h~d conquered her husband long&#xD;
before his death, and had him tame and tractable as a farm-&#xD;
horse; especially with her handsome daughter, with b er&#xD;
girlish ways, thrown in. So he wisely concluded that the&#xD;
best thing he could do was to compromise, and take the&#xD;
Duke as partnership stock, and pay his expenses in shares,&#xD;
and thus rule out all other bidders. As Frank had no&#xD;
maiden relatives to interfere in his behalf; and as in the&#xD;
event of a failure to captivate the Duke, Frank might con-&#xD;
ceal from the world the mortification and disappointment of&#xD;
the family, by taking the hand which the Duke refused, Mrs.&#xD;
Corbin accepted a compromise. Frank, pleased with the&#xD;
compromise, did not stop to inquire the process of reasoning&#xD;
by which she assented to it.&#xD;
The advantage of the partnership to Mrs. Corbin was&#xD;
soon made apparent; for, when, the Duke took advantage of&#xD;
the officer's kind invitation to visit his country-seat, Mrs.&#xD;
Corbin could not of course attend him, and she had to in-&#xD;
trust every thing to her partner.&#xD;
Her s~isp~nse, though great, was not of long duration; for&#xD;
the Duke soon tired of country life, and sighed for more&#xD;
tender nursing and sympathy than sCrvants could give, and&#xD;
yielded to the earnest solicitations of Frank to visit Bluff&#xD;
City.&#xD;
What an event was his visit to the nabobs and nabobesses&#xD;
about town! What toasting and fea~ting, and feasting and&#xD;
toasting! What wining and dining, and dining and wining!&#xD;
*&#xD;
The carriage he rode in, the chair he sat on, the spoon&#xD;
he sipped with, a~d the knife he atd with, were all sacred&#xD;
for life from that moment. Miss Clara would butter&#xD;
his waffle, Miss -- light his cigar, Miss - make his&#xD;

PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.                77&#xD;
toddy, and Mrs. Corbin and Clara prepare ointments for his&#xD;
wound! And so jt went. Frank was so beside himself&#xD;
with delight, that he needed some one to sit up with him.&#xD;
Young ladies that he barely knew, and who he once thought&#xD;
were disposed to snub him, would meet him in the street-.&#xD;
he was fbnd of meeting ladies there, and who is not, espe-&#xD;
cially if rich and pretty ?-and they would accost him:&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Vaughan, how do you do? I am so glad to&#xD;
see you! I understand you have been to New Orleans&#xD;
lately."&#xD;
"Yes; thank you; just returned from a short visit to the&#xD;
city ;" bowing politely, and stroking his chin.&#xD;
"You must come and see us. It has been a long time&#xD;
since I have had the pleasure of seeing you."&#xD;
"Thank you; I will take great pleasure in calling;&#xD;
nothing will give me more pleasure."&#xD;
"I understand you met with a new acquaintance on your&#xD;
trip ?"&#xD;
"Yes; thank you."&#xD;
"The young Duke de Castro 7"&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am; bearer of dispatches to our Government."&#xD;
"So I heard. You must bring your friend around with&#xD;
you.,~&#xD;
"Thank you; I will do so."&#xD;
They separate mutually happy; he that a Duke is thought&#xD;
to be his friend, and they at the near prospect of having a&#xD;
Duke in the house.&#xD;
Frank was fond of exercise, and whenever he could com-&#xD;
mand the Duke's time, which was not as often as he wished,&#xD;
as private carriages and footmen were always at his service,&#xD;
he would hire the finest buggy and the finest pair of bob-tail&#xD;
ponies he could get, and go it at a "two forty" pace through&#xD;
town; up one street and down another; cross over, and dash&#xD;
ahead. At such times, each window-pane had a pair of&#xD;

bright eye~ at it; and if he passed a neighborhood where&#xD;
the -eyes iere not at the windows, he would take it for&#xD;
granted that the residents did not know he and the Duke&#xD;
were passing, and would ride around that way again, at a&#xD;
slower pace; but when he would see a little negro or one of&#xD;
the children look at him, and turn and run in the house, to&#xD;
carry the news of his and the Duke's proximity, the bob-tails&#xD;
would- dart forward at break-neck speed.&#xD;

Confused, above,&#xD;

&#xD;
IT was announced that Mr. Broadhead, a retired merchant&#xD;
prince, with a fashionable wife and marriageable daughters,&#xD;
intended giving a grand party in :compliment to the Duke ;&#xD;
and the cards were issued several days beforehand, that all&#xD;
might have full time to do honor to his distinguish ed guest, by&#xD;
the newness and expense of their attire; for of course it was&#xD;
not expected that anybody would wear to see a Duke what they&#xD;
had ever worn to see anybody el e ; so time had to be given for&#xD;
each one to prepare for this important event. The company was&#xD;
to be select, and the town was all agog. Those who had new&#xD;
carriages, new horses, new footmen, and new respectability,&#xD;
were of course invited, and crowded the streets and dry-goods&#xD;
shops. Large gaps were made i the dry-goods shelves and&#xD;
the husbands' purses; the needles~of maritua-mnakers, and cash,&#xD;
were made to fly-sewing-machines were noti then invented.&#xD;
The servant that carried the card-basket, passed by Piper's&#xD;

without stopping. "The girls" and Betsy thought nothing&#xD;
of it, and cared less; but Piper's nostrils spread and nose&#xD;
flattened and under-lip drooped, and he exhausted his trad-&#xD;
ing qualities to the utmost to bargain for invitations, but in&#xD;
vain. Mr. Broadhead was very polite, but seemed not to&#xD;
know that Piper had daughters; and neither Gilpin nor&#xD;
Piper could force conviction upon him.&#xD;
The eve1~ing came, and there were no vacant seats. It was&#xD;
one of the parties where all who were desired came. It dif-&#xD;
fered from other parties upon like occasions, only in the cx-&#xD;
~essive outlay and extravagant display of every thing. new:&#xD;
the silver waiters were new, the cake-stands were new,&#xD;
goblets were new, the forks were new, the champagne was&#xD;
new, cigars new, the furniture was new, the house was new,&#xD;
the servants were new, the manners of the host and hostess&#xD;
were new, the guest was new; every thing one saw, every&#xD;
thing one touched, every thing one tasted was new. But the&#xD;
newness of every thing did not destroy the appetite nor thirst&#xD;
of the company, and the eating and drinking went on as at&#xD;
other parties, when eating and drinking are expected. Every-&#xD;
body had to drink with the Duke, and the Duke had to drink&#xD;
with everybody; and everybody had to drink with everybody,&#xD;
and it was kept up until somebody put a "brick" in the hat&#xD;
of the Duke and everybody. At least so everybody said on&#xD;
the street the next day.&#xD;
An amusing occurrence took place the next day in the&#xD;
dining-room. When Mr. Broadhead Was sufficiently re-&#xD;
covered from the effects of the new champagne of the night&#xD;
before to get up, he walked into the room with his gown and&#xD;
slippers, and addressed his wife~ s serving-maid, who was&#xD;
asserting the dishes, in order to return such as had been&#xD;
hired and borrowed.&#xD;
"Which is the pl~te and knife and fork used by the Duke&#xD;
last night ?" asked 1~IIr. Broadhead of the servant.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"Lord, Master, I don't know."&#xD;
"You huzzy, you! have you gone an.d put them with the&#xD;
other dishes?"&#xD;
"Master, I didn't know any better! Thby' was ourn."&#xD;
"Ourn! I know they were ours! I wanted them kept&#xD;
separate, so they i~ould , be put away."&#xD;
"Master, I di~ln't know it. I didn't know his eatin' with'm&#xD;
made 'em any different."&#xD;
"Clear out of here, you impertinent~ huzzy, you! If you&#xD;
speak another word to me, I will-"&#xD;
The loud talking aroused Mrs. Broadhead, and she came&#xD;
in with night-cap and gown, and wishes to know-&#xD;
"What is the matter ?"&#xD;
"This creature has gone and put the plate and knife, and&#xD;
fork used by the Duke with the other dishes, and I would&#xD;
not have had it done for the value of the whole set !"&#xD;
"My, Sarah! bow could you have done such a thing?"&#xD;
"Why, Mistress, I didii~'t&#xD;
"Silence, you thing! Didn't I tell you, if you opened&#xD;
your mouth, I would ~'&#xD;
"Why, Mis-"&#xD;
"Stop." He took her upon the mouth! "Didn't I tell&#xD;
you not to open your mouth again? what do you know of a&#xD;
Duke ?"                                I&#xD;
"Husband! husband! how can you do so? She was only&#xD;
answering my question !"&#xD;
"I don't care; I told her not to open her mouth again.&#xD;
"Dear! see, her mouth is all bleeding !"&#xD;
The sight of the effect of his violence, though nothing&#xD;
serious, calmed him down, and he stammered out a sort of&#xD;
apology to the negro, and left the room.&#xD;
By dint of rummaging, thinking, comparing, etc., the fork&#xD;
was identified, and carefully wrapped up in tissue paper and&#xD;
put away.&#xD;

Mrs. Corbin took the alarm. It would never do to allow&#xD;
Mr. Broadhead to exceed her in paying honors to the Duke,&#xD;
arid cards were spon issued for a party to be given by Mrs.&#xD;
Corbin. Her efforts were commensurate with the magnitude&#xD;
of the occasion; and every thing was as new as the latest&#xD;
fashion. The only thing which materially distinguished it&#xD;
from the party given by Mr. Broadhead, was the fainting of&#xD;
the Duke. The constant round of dissipation which the&#xD;
hospitality of the place had forced upon him, had aggravated&#xD;
his wound, and just as every thing was at its tide upon the&#xD;
evening of the party, he fainted, and, Q! pleasure inexpres-&#xD;
sible in falling, his head drooped upon Miss Clara's knee!&#xD;
He was borne to the nearest lounge, which chanced to be in&#xD;
Miss Clara's room, and she had the additional happiness of&#xD;
supporting his head and fanning him Almost too much&#xD;
happiness for one frame to bear. His extreme modesty and&#xD;
delicacy were such, that he would never allow any one, not&#xD;
even the physicians whom he consulted, to examine or (Iress&#xD;
his wound; hence no one would offei~d his delicacy by opening&#xD;
his bosom to relieve it, while he was in an insensible condi-&#xD;
tion; though Dr. Floyd and a half dozen other physicians&#xD;
were there ready to tender their services gratis, and to mark&#xD;
and lay away for life the instrument that should probe his&#xD;
wound. All that was done was to open his collar, bathe his&#xD;
face with Cologne, and fan him. The blood that oozed from&#xD;
the wound stained the shirt bosom and vest, at the sight of&#xD;
which Miss Clara felt like fainting, and had a good mind to&#xD;
do so; it would show such sensibility and sympathy. She&#xD;
hesitated, and would have fainted outright, but she saw one&#xD;
of the Miss Broadheads there, and if she fainted they would&#xD;
fan him. This determined her not to faint.&#xD;
The fainting of the Duke was all that was wanting to com-&#xD;
plete Mrs. ~Corbin's happiness and triumph. Not that she&#xD;
took pleasure in human suffering; on the contrary, she was&#xD;
&#xD;
a kind-hearted woman enough; but it furnished an excuse&#xD;
for detaining the Duke at her house for several days, and&#xD;
Clara would be his constant nurse How pleasing the&#xD;
thought! What if the party was broken up? What if it&#xD;
did destroy the enjoyment of the balance of the evening, so&#xD;
far as her company was concerned? It made no difference,&#xD;
for the party was not given for their enjoyment. What were&#xD;
they but fit hecatombs to the divinity in the other room,&#xD;
with his head upon Clara's knee, and her finest Cashmere&#xD;
shawl thrown negligently across him! And 0! happiness&#xD;
too great for mortal enjoyment! fit only for the gods! there&#xD;
is a stain of blood, Ducal blood, upon the shawl! If the&#xD;
Duke could have known, as he lay there all pale and languid,&#xD;
how often in after weeks-we dare not say years, or. even&#xD;
months, for the passion of fashionable folks is not measured&#xD;
by time, if of any duration-~the dear creature, who supported&#xD;
his well-oiled head, and never wearied in fanning him, and&#xD;
suffered the mosquitoes, that were numerous and ravenous, to&#xD;
bite away at her well-powdered and polished neck, ad libitum,&#xD;
for fear an effort to disturb their carnival would disturb his re-&#xD;
pose, would put her sweet lips to the stained spot and kiss it&#xD;
over and over again, it must, to some extent, have alleviated&#xD;
his pain. She had never held her mother's, father's, sister's,&#xD;
or brother's head in that way, even when raging with fever&#xD;
~rnd pain; and why should she then sit and let the big&#xD;
swamp mosquitoes hold their carnival about her neck and&#xD;
shoulders, supporting the head, and fanning the midnight&#xD;
hours away, to soothe to sleep this acquaintance of less than&#xD;
half a moon? And why, in this task, hard as it was, should&#xD;
she be the envy of all the votaries of fashion, married and&#xD;
single, in the town? The answer brings a blush to the cheek&#xD;
of every true lover of Republican simplicity.&#xD;

WHILE the parties and toasting were in full progress, and&#xD;
everybody run mad with the Duke fever, a Federal officer in&#xD;
town, noted for his unimpressibility, became slightly affected&#xD;
with the malady, and was a good deal exercised to know what&#xD;
he ought to do in the premises. He was a man of stern, un-&#xD;
compromising morality, and of superior literary attainments,&#xD;
not surpassed perhaps by any in the State. He eschewed&#xD;
society, in its general acceptation, almost entirely; conlinin g&#xD;
himself to the companionship of books and a few friends, to&#xD;
whom he was much attached, and who took great pleasure in&#xD;
his companyK His talents and education placed him far&#xD;
above the eitipty pursuits of the fashionable world, and he&#xD;
never gave them a thought, but plodded on his even way as&#xD;
though they were not in existence. Ordinarily, a new arrival&#xD;
was a matter of the smallest consequence to him, but here&#xD;
was a distinguished foreigner, a minister from a foreign&#xD;
court to that of his government, and all the 6lite and aris-&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
tocracy of town were feasting and toasting him; and although&#xD;
he did not care One straw for either the 6lite or aristocracy,&#xD;
he feW the honor and dignity of the government he repre-&#xD;
~cnted was in his keeping, and it ought to be maintained;&#xD;
but how to do ~t with a due regard for the dignity of the&#xD;
subject and the' sA~allness of his means, was a question which&#xD;
puzzled arid embarrassed him. A dinner was out of the&#xD;
question; it would cost more than the salary of his office,&#xD;
and it would fall so far short of the shine and newness of&#xD;
those given by others, that it would bring his government&#xD;
into contempt; and it was a distressing doubt with him,&#xD;
whether he could dispense with the formality of a dinner,&#xD;
and invite a few friends to meet the Duke to tea. In his&#xD;
distress he had recourse to Frank Vaughan, who was sup~&#xD;
posed to be au fait in all such matters; and besides, as he&#xD;
was the intimate frie ~d and companion of the Duke, he could&#xD;
make the matter all ~ght with him, should the affair not&#xD;
come off secundem ar~em. (Mr. Officer was a scholar, great&#xD;
on Latin proverbs.)&#xD;
"Frank," said he one day, "as an officer of the government,&#xD;
I have thought it perhaps my duty to pay some court to your&#xD;
friend, the Duke de Castro, he being a minister to our court,&#xD;
and not knowing exactly what ought to be expected of me&#xD;
upon an occasion of this sort, I thought I would consult with&#xD;
you, and get your advice. Quce fuerant vitia, mores sunt, as&#xD;
Seneca has it, and I am not quite up to the times. What&#xD;
shall I do?"&#xD;
"Give a party, by all means. I am glad you have thought&#xD;
of it."&#xD;
"Qucerendc&amp;amp; pecunic&amp;amp; primum~; and I do not know where&#xD;
to get it. Besides, my house is too small."&#xD;
"Don't be poking your Latin at me! I do not know what&#xD;
it means. Speak English, and I will answer you."&#xD;
"Beg your pardon. It means that money must first be&#xD;

had, and I have not got it-a declaration one does not like&#xD;
to make in English."&#xD;
"As to that, I will loan you the money if you wish; though&#xD;
my deposit has been considerably reduced lately."&#xD;
"I am obliged to you; and all else settled, I may take ad-&#xD;
vantage of your kind offer. My house, as I said, is too small,&#xD;
and, worse tht~n that, I have but little silver, new or old, and&#xD;
the thought of feeding a Duke, who has not, from his infancy,&#xD;
known what it was to eat off of any thing newer than tiLmily&#xD;
plate, old as the invasion of the Moors, with my old iron forks,&#xD;
cannot be thought of Can I not waive the formality of a&#xD;
dinner-a party is out of the question-and invite him to&#xD;
tea? and invite a few of the swells- about town to meet him?&#xD;
I know, ordinarily, they would not cross their legs under&#xD;
my cheap cherry, but in this case they would be oblivious&#xD;
to every thing except the presence of the Duke."&#xD;
"That gill never do; it will be worse than the forks. Can&#xD;
you not borrow some plate from some of your friends ?"&#xD;
"I have no friends who have plate; and if I had I would&#xD;
not borrow. My friends are either poor or plain."&#xD;
"I'll borrow some for you."&#xD;
"Never. My pride would not permit that, if nothing else&#xD;
interfered."&#xD;
~tOthers are not ashamed to do it, and do do it."&#xD;
"That may be: ego ilium pe'riisse duco, cui quiclern periU&#xD;
pudor. Excuse the Latin."&#xD;
"I do not know what your Latin means; but if not a&#xD;
party, a dinner cannot be dispensed with. Let it be that or&#xD;
nothing."&#xD;
"Nothing it will have to be then. I 'do not understand&#xD;
those thitigs; they are out of my line; and as Cicero says:&#xD;
Ne me pudet, ut istos futeri nescire quod nesciam. Which&#xD;
means, to translate it for you, 'I am not ashamed, as some&#xD;
are, to confess my ignorance of what I know nothing about.'&#xD;
&#xD;
And I also adopt the proverb, Ne tentes aut perfice: which&#xD;
means, in broad English, 'I will do it well, or I will not do it&#xD;
at all.'"&#xD;
"Iu this you are right; though I regret your inability to&#xD;
show the Duke some attention as a government official."&#xD;
"I cannot think of imitating some of the higher function-&#xD;
aries of government, who pay twice the salary of the office&#xD;
to support the dignity of the place."&#xD;
"This thing settled, Frank, what are you and the Duke&#xD;
going to do? He seems very fond of you, and still wears&#xD;
your cloak, I see."&#xD;
"He will report himself at Washington, and then return&#xD;
home; and I will accompany him. His Government will&#xD;
undertake to behead him, for the loss of his dispatches, and&#xD;
the consequent failure of a portion of his mission. The loss&#xD;
of the dispatches will be used as a mere pretext, as only an&#xD;
excuse is wanted for the purpose of beheading him. His&#xD;
chivalry and daring, and accurate knowledge of military&#xD;
tactics and military affairs generally, lave made him a favorite&#xD;
with the army; and his popular manners have endeared him&#xD;
to the common people, and his house is one oi' the most&#xD;
powerful, as one of the most ancient, among the nobility,; and&#xD;
fears were entertained by Government that if a revolution&#xD;
should break out, and he remain with the army, it would be&#xD;
an easy matter to place his father or some member of his&#xD;
house into the Presidency. His mission, therefore, was only&#xD;
an excuse to get him out of the country. lie has advised&#xD;
his friends of his misfortune; a~d they will make arrange~&#xD;
ments for his safe return to the army; and once there, and&#xD;
on his guard, he can defy the officers. He Will wait advices&#xD;
from them, before leaving the United States. For further&#xD;
precaution, it is agreed that I shall personate him, as we&#xD;
are the same size, and are said to favor, [stroking his chin.]&#xD;
K       The chances are that as soon as I land I will be arrested for&#xD;

the Duke, and .~ouriers sent forward to the capital to an-&#xD;
nounce the fact of the arrest. His friends will raise a&#xD;
great outcry, and thus enable him to escape the vigilance of&#xD;
Government officials, and at the same time afford to th~in the&#xD;
means of fomenting an outbreak; and as soon as things are&#xD;
ripe for action, he will appear at the head of his regiment,&#xD;
and, with the aid of his friends among the no~ility~ and&#xD;
the disaffected among the people, always fickle and ready for&#xD;
a change, he will make a bold strike for the Government.&#xD;
In the meantime I will try every way in my power to protest&#xD;
my innocence; show my passport, which they will believe to&#xD;
be a forgery or an imposition; but, as I will be unable' to&#xD;
speak th~ language, I will be unable to explain how his ducal&#xD;
ring and seal, which I am to have, came into my possession,&#xD;
and how I came by other articles bearing the coat of arms&#xD;
of his house. When he appears in public, however, Ii will&#xD;
of course be released, and will threaten to complain to my&#xD;
Government. The republic will become alarmed, and make&#xD;
every effort to repair the wron~ inflicted upon me. My&#xD;
baggage will no doubt have been seized and destroyed; and&#xD;
I will make a loud complaint of the wrong, and fix: the&#xD;
damage 1~o inc at a fabulous sum; and the republic, rather, at&#xD;
that critical junction of affairs, than hazard another cause&#xD;
of complaint from the United States, will settle the demand.&#xD;
The Duke is confident of success; and, from information he&#xD;
ha~ furnished me, I know, in the present disturbed, unsettled&#xD;
state of the country, he must succeed."&#xD;
"And what is to be your share of the spoils ?"&#xD;
"As soon as he or his father is placed in the Presidency,&#xD;
he engages that I shall have any place in the Government I&#xD;
may choose ;" stroking his chin, and pushing back his hair.&#xD;
"And what place will you take ?"&#xD;
"I think I shall go to the Court of St. 5ames. 1~IIy want&#xD;
of familiarity with the Spanish tongue would be of no disad-&#xD;

vantage to me there; and the court language b~ing my ver-&#xD;
nacular, I will be able to serve the republic better than a&#xD;
native. And being rem oved from view, it will relieve,. to&#xD;
some extent, the jealousy which will naturally enough be&#xD;
felt by the nobility, at the placing of a stranger over them.&#xD;
Besidesit will put me out of the way of the dangers of a&#xD;
revolution, which, with such an unstable government and&#xD;
fickle people, may be apprehended any day."&#xD;
"Frank," and he looked quizzically at him, "I always&#xD;
thought you a little cracked, but I never before believed you&#xD;
were really non compose meut~s."&#xD;
"What do you mean, sir ?" bristling up.&#xD;
"I mean that you are a fool to trust to the specious tale&#xD;
of this conceited foreigner."&#xD;
"Do you dare to insinuate that he is not what he pre~&#xD;
tends to be ?" stretching himself up to his full height, and&#xD;
assuming a fighting attitude.&#xD;
"I do not! not at all !" eyeing Frank's fist, and stepping&#xD;
back a foot or two.&#xD;
The conversation ended, and Frank was only half satisfied&#xD;
with himself. But how could he see his vision, his air-castle,&#xD;
securely based, as he thought, and so ele~ and tastefully&#xD;
built, tumble to pieces before his eyes, and not make an effort&#xD;
to prop it up? "Ne sutor ultra crepidarn" caught his ear, as&#xD;
his friend closed the door, going out.&#xD;

LA FONTAINE.&#xD;
A J5AY or two after Mrs. Corbin's party, the Sabbath bells,&#xD;
with their loud and solem ding-dong, ding-doug, were call-&#xD;
ing the citizens of Bluff ity to the temples erected for the&#xD;
worship of the Great Builder of nature's temple, and the&#xD;
worshippers of mammon and fashion, together with the truly&#xD;
pious and good, were wending their way thither, with the&#xD;
view, let us hope, Qf forgetting for a moment the new and&#xD;
glittering god of their we~k-day's idolatry, in contemplating&#xD;
the age and grandeur of the God of the Sabbath. Each&#xD;
denomination of Christians had erected its house ~f worship;&#xD;
and, after ringing their bells in ~uccession, their sweet chime&#xD;
sounded far oVer the surrounding hills, returning hack in&#xD;
soft echoes which fell like a note of entreaty upon the car of&#xD;
the careless, telling him it was a holy day.&#xD;
But on this lovely morning, when even the spring breezes&#xD;
whispered more softly in the trees, and all things spoke of&#xD;
that "Sabbath stillness" which is felt so often, but, cannot be&#xD;
&#xD;
described, the pious ear was shocked all at once by a loud&#xD;
whooping and hallooing, as if a n~enagerie of wild animals&#xD;
were let loose in their midst. They turn to see from whence&#xD;
this violation of public sentiment comes, and behold Piper&#xD;
on Gilpin, and his man Grandison, with two or three ser-&#xD;
vants, trying to herd and drive his cattle:&#xD;
"llui, hui! hey there! hui along! Run there, Grandi-&#xD;
son, and head Broadhead! quick! You Nance! confound&#xD;
your heart of you! turn Speckle back there! Bj~tsy, 0&#xD;
Betsy! [at the top of his voice,] make some of them run&#xD;
down there and turn Fullpiggin's heifer back !" such a&#xD;
noise and confusion! The calf darts by, and Betsy after it.&#xD;
She heads it at last, and it goes lowing back. to the herd.&#xD;
Piper and Gilpin go hither and thither: "ilni, hui! hey&#xD;
along! Confound that blasted bull! he had to turn back.&#xD;
I'll make beef of him! Get up, here, Gilpin: you'll lay&#xD;
down and wallow, next !"&#xD;
The cattle were finally herded, and trotted off in a com-&#xD;
pact body, lowin~ down the street among the church-goers;&#xD;
the large ones horning the si~aller, and forcing them upon&#xD;
the sidewalk, frightening' pedestrians, and causing theni to&#xD;
skit from side to side and across the street, to avoid their&#xD;
horns and hoofs.&#xD;
The crowd goes on to church, wondering how a man who&#xD;
desires to be respectable and respected can thus desecrate&#xD;
the Sabbath; and Piper rides on behind his cattle, and ~von-&#xD;
ders why he is not as much respected and as respectable as&#xD;
other folks!&#xD;
As Piper and his cattle are going one way, they meet&#xD;
Smith and Blunt going another&#xD;
"There go Piper and his cattle," says Blunt.&#xD;
"Yes; and is it not strange that a man with a lovely family,&#xD;
such as I understand he has, should thus openly insult the&#xD;
religious sentiment of the community ?"&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"And while he turns hi~ back 'openly upon society, and&#xD;
publicly profanes the Sabbath, he thinks it strange and very&#xD;
unjust in society to retaliate, and turn its back on him. I&#xD;
am told it is entertaining, good as a circus, to hear him rate&#xD;
at the injustice of society."&#xD;
"Ha, ha, ha! I have heard him. And yet if any friend&#xD;
were to dare to hint to him the truth, he would catch a&#xD;
canin~ for his pains."&#xD;
Of course they who push Piper and his cattle out of&#xD;
society in this easy, cavalier sort of way, for openly disre-&#xD;
garding the second articlee of the decalogue, in driving stock&#xD;
on Sunday, will themselves "remember th~ day, to keep it&#xD;
holy ?" Yes, they seem to be going to church. No; they&#xD;
ride past. They are perhaps expecting some important&#xD;
news by mail, that will n6t bear postponing until Monday;&#xD;
and as the mail remains open only a short tiftie on Sunday&#xD;
morning, they purpose to get it before going to church.&#xD;
No; they take a different street. Why, where can they be&#xD;
going? Not to a restaurant, surely? Yes, it must be; they&#xD;
hitch their horses, and go in at a private entrance. But then&#xD;
they will soon come out again? No. Wonder what they are&#xD;
doing in there, that keeps them so long? Let the pious who&#xD;
so severely and justly condemn Piper for the open embla-&#xD;
zonment of his impiety, open the door quietly, and walk in,&#xD;
and see what 4etains Smith and Blunt. It is a slight breach&#xD;
of custom and good-breeding; but they will not take offence.&#xD;
Handsome apartment, you think? finely finished, ceiling&#xD;
'elaborately frescoed, rich curtains festoon the windows, car-&#xD;
.pets soft and fi~ie, furniture elegant, every thing orderly as a&#xD;
private parlor. Hi! you start back! What is the matter?&#xD;
You need not e alarmed; it is only Blunt, Smith, Nickols,&#xD;
Clarkson, Col. Isaacs, and Capt. Orr, taking a social game for&#xD;
amusement ! They are all gentlemen, honorable men, leaders&#xD;
and exemplars in society, the same who slam the door in the&#xD;

but not to win; only to count the game. They drink, too!&#xD;
you say? Well, yes; but that is for good cheer, just to&#xD;
enliyen them a little; nothing more! Worse than Piper!&#xD;
you say? Perhaps you are right; but beware! do n't speak&#xD;
it above your breath! They hold the reinsIaere; and if&#xD;
you dare insult them by drawing a parallel between them and&#xD;
Piper, they will run the wagon right over you. Can't stay.?&#xD;
Do n't leave; too late to go to church. Come, stay it out.&#xD;
You consent? Good! You are rather s bruck with these&#xD;
two new acquaintances? Not surprised; fine-looking men;&#xD;
their titles are not meaningless appendages, put on as a con-&#xD;
venient handle, but well and bloodily earned. They are&#xD;
brave knights, who have gallantly won their spurs, fleshed&#xD;
their swords in thek country's cause. The Colonel's name&#xD;
belongs to history; his deeds of daring upon the field where&#xD;
"Greek met Greek," belong to his country. His face will&#xD;
bear reading: peruse it. That full, prominent forehead,&#xD;
defiant look, fierce, flashing eye, shaggy hair and eyebroWs,&#xD;
broad, deep chest, and muscular arm, mark asavery&#xD;
war.god! In the full tide of battle the rage ~of the lion is&#xD;
not more terrible! Priam had not in all his irmy a braver&#xD;
soldier, nor Occur de Lion a bolder knight. The Captain is&#xD;
equally brave, equally enduring, but more modest, and less&#xD;
ambitious. They wield the tongue, the pen, and the sword&#xD;
with equal effect. You are surprised to see them here?&#xD;
Correct. Excess, you think, is beginning to tell on them?&#xD;

and table! springs up and glares~ at Nickols with his savage&#xD;
eyes! shakes his mane in a rage! Nickols shrinks away as&#xD;
from destiny; but see, his cupidity is greater than his fears;&#xD;
he reaches for his winnings, clutches and draws them to him.&#xD;
Gracious! Stop your ears! "By -- I" Jsaacs has sworn&#xD;
by a name above all other ,names, a name the pen is reluctant&#xD;
through reverence to write, that Nickols "cheated." Mis-&#xD;
take: he did not cheat; but Nickols is afraid to correct him;&#xD;
all afraid to say a word. The man still glares, and shakes&#xD;
his mane at Nickols. Nickols wants to escape; does not&#xD;
know how. If he does not escape sqon, blood will be spilt.&#xD;
What is to~ be done? Do you run ~out and cry "fire."&#xD;
There, that~ will do. See, Nickols has escaped, and goes&#xD;
hawking, as fast as his broolnstiQk legs will carry him, to&#xD;
his office, opens the door, turns the key. . There he is safe.&#xD;
All right. Yoiz~reathc freer. Nickols is not a bad man,&#xD;
you ask Y Certaii~ly not. No swindler; fond of adram,&#xD;
fond of cards, but~h~rmless as a woman, otherwise..&#xD;
Late that afternoon there was a tap at the door of Nickols'&#xD;
office. He s~ i4ed, and turned pale. He looked through the&#xD;
window, and ~eeing Captain Orr, instead of; as he feared,&#xD;
Colonel Jsaacs, he opened the door, and the Captain, in the&#xD;
politest manner possible, excused himself, and handed Nick-&#xD;
ols an open note; from Colonel Isnacs, demanding the satisfac-&#xD;
tion "known to gentlemen," for cheating at cards; and ap-&#xD;
pointed his friend, Captain Orr, to meet one selected by&#xD;
Nickols, to arrange the terms. Captain Orr was very polite,&#xD;
but very much intoxicated; Nickols was flurried, and went&#xD;
hawking about the room.&#xD;
"I a~ sorry to trouiAe you, but at w~iat hour may I ex-&#xD;
pect an answer ?" asked Captain Orr.&#xD;
"lla-a-a-awk-ha-a-a-awk-ha-a-a-awk--in the morning."&#xD;
"Thank you," and bows himself out.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Nickols continued to walk the floor--pulled out the note&#xD;
and re-read it, and soliloquised: "IIa-a-a-awk-a challenge,&#xD;
heli? lla-a-a-awk--wants to shoot me, lich? Ha-a-a-awk--&#xD;
ha, ha, ha! but if he does, I 'm d-d. lIa-a-a-awk-his&#xD;
pistols - ha-a-a-awk--will have to be--ha-a-a-awk-longer&#xD;
than his hair-ha-a-a-awk-if he does." He took out his&#xD;
winnings, and counted them over-was well satisfied-put&#xD;
them in his leather wallet~L3put on his hat, opened and closed&#xD;
the door quietly, turned the key, took. it out, and went ha-a-&#xD;
a-awkin g home.&#xD;
Very early upon the ensuing morning, bef@e the town ~vas&#xD;
astir, Blunt, who had been up all night playing for amuse-&#xD;
ment, and betting to count the game, and was on his way&#xD;
to the Market-house to get ~ cup of coffee, saw Nickols, with&#xD;
carpet-sack in hand, hurr~4ng towards a steamboat just push-&#xD;
ing out from the landing, bound for New Orleans, and called&#xD;
out:&#xD;
"Ilallo, Nickols! where are you going ?"&#xD;
"Ha-a-a-awk," and a, quicker pace, is the only answer.&#xD;
"Off for New Orleans, 'Nickols ?"&#xD;
"lla-a-a-awk," and jumps aboard.&#xD;
"Sorry you didn't 'let me know you were going; I would&#xD;
have sent some letters by you."&#xD;
"lla-a-a-awk," and disappears through the cabin-door.&#xD;
When he left his office on the preceding afternoon, he went&#xD;
home and informed his aunt, a kind old lady who had for&#xD;
years kept house for him, and who thought the' world had no&#xD;
other nephew like to him, that he was going to California,&#xD;
and should leave on the first boat bound for New Orleans.&#xD;
She was greatly distressed at first, and endeavored to dissuade&#xD;
him from going; but upon his explaining the danger he was&#xD;
in, and the necessity of keeping his design a secret until lie&#xD;
should have time to leave New Orleans, she entered with all&#xD;
her heart into his plans. His clothes were soon packed; and&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8172-00000049"/>&#xD;
96        PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.&#xD;
after raking up all the cash about the house, and writing her&#xD;
a deed securing to her a life..interest in his property, he took&#xD;
his valise or carpet-sack, and went to his office to await a&#xD;
downward-bound boat; and as soon as one landed, he started&#xD;
ha-a-a-awking on his way to the far-off Pacific, out of reach&#xD;
of Jsaacs' bowie-knife and pistol.&#xD;
Prompt to the hour, Captain Orr went hiccoughing to&#xD;
Nichols' office for his answer, and was almost sobered 'by&#xD;
seeing on the door, in large letters, "FOR RENT"---~-and&#xD;
just under them on the same card, in smaller letters&#xD;
"Your answer." With an oath or two at Nickols' cow-&#xD;
ardice, as the excellent foppery of this world is pleased to&#xD;
call a man's unwillingness to be shot at, he turned away;&#xD;
and the two friends continued their spree until their over-&#xD;
taxed stomachs would receive no more, Captain Orr's dri~nken&#xD;
fancy being haunted all the time, like a disagreeable night-&#xD;
mare, with certain large letters, accompanied by small ones.&#xD;
When entirely sober, they were almost oblivious to what&#xD;
had passed. Colonel Jsaacs had an indistinct recollection&#xD;
of having insulted and denounced a very timid man; and,&#xD;
obedient to the instincts of the true gentleman he really&#xD;
was, when not excited by the de~on of the bottle, he went&#xD;
with his friend to Nichols' offi~ e to offer an apology for&#xD;
his rudeness and bullying. There ~vere the big letters which&#xD;
had so tormented the Captain's fancy. The whole thing&#xD;
came back to them by degrees. With a smile at the tim-&#xD;
idity which would make a man leave his friends and home,&#xD;
and cross the continent, sooner than be shot, they sought&#xD;
his residence tp make there the only reparation in their&#xD;
power. The old aunt was not a little frightened to see&#xD;
them approach the house; but her fears were exchanged&#xD;
for a very different emotion when their errand was ex-&#xD;
plained, and she was desired to convey their apologies to&#xD;
her nephew, and receive a thousand offered to herself.&#xD;

ONE Sunday evening in the spring of the ensuing year,&#xD;
as Colonel Clarkson and his family were taking a stroll along&#xD;
the river bank at the plantation, a steamboat from below&#xD;
landed to put off some passengers. As the plank was pushed&#xD;
out some two or three gentlemen hurried ashore, and as one&#xD;
of them hurried to the plank, Clarkson was pleased to hear&#xD;
a loud "ha-a-a-awk."&#xD;
"By Jove, if there isn't Nickols," said he.&#xD;
Yes, it was Nickols, Vaughan, and one or two others, who&#xD;
had come to attend the spring term of the court.&#xD;
"Why, NickQls, my old friend, how are you? I am really&#xD;
glad to see you, old fellow," shaking him warmly by the&#xD;
hand. "I am glad to see you all, gentlemen. Come, walk&#xD;
to the house. Here, Ned," who, upon seeing passengers land&#xD;
that were the friends of his master, caine running for their&#xD;
baggage, "take the baggage of these gentlemen. Nickols, IC&#xD;
suppose you have returned laden with the dust from the gold&#xD;
region ?"&#xD;
"Ha-a-a-awk--plentyof dust, Colonel, plenty of dust, but&#xD;
no gold."&#xD;
"How is that? You go to California and not dig ?"-As&#xD;

he said this they stepped upon the gallery, and seats ~vere&#xD;
furnished. Nickols had another peculiarity not mentioned&#xD;
in his first introduction, purely a Nickolism: When very&#xD;
much amused at what he w~s relating, he would jump up&#xD;
from his seat, 5tiek out one foot, take his thigh in~ both his&#xD;
hands, and turn around a time or two, with a ha, h~, ha! he,&#xD;
he, he! and planting his feet upon the floor some eighteen&#xD;
inches apart, and his knees together, would poke his two fore-&#xD;
fingers at his auditor, with a grimace such as one sees in a&#xD;
comic almanac. At this remark of Colonel Clarksori, he&#xD;
jumped up, caiii~ht hold of his leg, whirled around, planted&#xD;
his feet upon thd floor, clapped his knees together, poked his&#xD;
two fingers at the Colonel, grimaced, and exclaimed,&#xD;
"Ha, ha, ha, he, he, he! did n't dig, l~eh? By the Lord,&#xD;
I did dig! ha, ha, ha! IF did dig! Do yo~i see these hands ?"&#xD;
approaching him, and' showing him a pair of hands as soft&#xD;
and small as a woman's. "lla-a-a-awk, I blistered them&#xD;
digging; do you understand? and then carried water until&#xD;
I wore out my breeches rubbing against the bucket. What&#xD;
do you think of that? By the Lord, I did dig."&#xD;
"Well, compose yourself, and sit down and give us a his-&#xD;
tory of your California life."&#xD;
"lla-a-a-awk; take a drink first, to neutralize tl~e poison I&#xD;
was drugged with by the bar-k~e~er of that boat."&#xD;
"What sort of a country is it, Nickols ?"&#xD;
"Ha-a-a-~awk; the d-dest country the Lord ever made."&#xD;
"Emphatic enough, but not very definite. What do you&#xD;
mean?"&#xD;
"lla-a-a-awk; I love brandy, do you know that ?"&#xD;
"I have always been very much inclined to suspect that&#xD;
yom did."&#xD;
"But I love money better; ha, ha, ha, he, he, he! Four&#xD;
dollars will buy f6rty drinks in Bluff City, did you know&#xD;
that? At a drink a day, it will last him a month and ten&#xD;

are thirsty and it does not cost too much; you understand?&#xD;

"Well, what has that to do with California ?"&#xD;
"A d.-d sight; ha, ha! You knew 5---.-? Used to&#xD;
'know him in Bluff City; always liked him; he always treated&#xD;
me like II was a gentleman, and it is so rare for gentlemen to&#xD;
treat me in that way, I am grateful, and remember it. You&#xD;
are one of the few that always treat me as a gentlemen, Colonel,&#xD;

shoulder; "I love you, Colonel; you are one of the men I&#xD;
like; you are unsophisticated."&#xD;
"Well, go on with your story; what about S~ ?"&#xD;
"The first thing IF saw on landing at San Francisco was a&#xD;
o~reat bio~&#xD;

letters. Ha-a-a-awk; it was as welcome to me as 'Entertain&#xD;

drink-hut did n't ask me to take one-waited for me to ask&#xD;
-he sat down five glasses, and we took our drink-five drinks&#xD;
-I threw down a sovereign-a ' sove' was worth five dollars&#xD;
in California-and waited for my change-four dollars and&#xD;
a half-and if he did n't tell me I owed him fifty cents I&#xD;
wish I may be d-.------d! but as it was me-an old acquaint-&#xD;

~" I think you did n't take ~iiany more drinks at ~&#xD;
"You are right there. I did n't; so let us take another&#xD;
to make up for lost time."&#xD;
They were reluctant to take another drink, for it was evi-&#xD;
dent that Nickols had taken too many already; hut good&#xD;
hospitality, or rather the bad hospitality of the times, required&#xD;
that Clarkson should second the request, and they repeated&#xD;
their drink.&#xD;

"Whatever people paid me to haul, but principally provi-&#xD;

"Did you make any money at it ?" asked Vaughan, who,&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT..&#xD;
&#xD;
101&#xD;
&#xD;
though not exactly avaricious, was always in close pursuit of&#xD;
a fortune, just on the eve of making one, and easily excited&#xD;
on the subject of fortune-making.&#xD;
"Yes; I made money."&#xD;
"What did you do with it ?"&#xD;
~'Spent it; ha, ha, ha !" Walking off a step or two, and&#xD;
turning back, and seating himself by Vaughan, he planted a&#xD;
and upon each thigh, his elbows sticking out, and looking&#xD;
at Vaughan, said:&#xD;
"Vaughan, I came Within an ace of making the grandest&#xD;
fortune ever made in California !"&#xD;
"Explain," said Vaughan, all attention.&#xD;
"Were you ever in Copiah ?" (A pine-woods county in&#xD;
Mississippi.)&#xD;
"Yes, once."&#xD;
"Did you ever look up at the top of one of those tall&#xD;
pines ?"&#xD;
"Often."&#xD;
"How high is the tallest one you ever saw ?"&#xD;
"I do not know; a hundred feet or more."&#xD;
"Yes, nearly twice that. What is the price of shingles in&#xD;
Bluff City ?"&#xD;
"Three dollars per thousand, I believe."&#xD;
"How many can a man make per day ?"&#xD;
"I do not know; from one to three thousand, I suppose."&#xD;
"Ha-a-a-awk, they are worth from seventy-five to one&#xD;
hundred dollars per thousand iii California! Do you hear?&#xD;
from seventy-flve to one hundred dollars per thousand! What&#xD;
do you think of that ?"&#xD;
"That I would like to be a shingle-maker, and have Co-&#xD;
piah moved to California."&#xD;
"'You would, eh? You may well~ say that; but there are&#xD;
pines therd that can beat, two feet to one, any pine you ever&#xD;
saw growing in Copiah. While driving to the mines, I passed&#xD;

a pine forest, the most magnificent a lumber-merchant's eye&#xD;
ever feasted upon. The Copiali pines are saplings to them.&#xD;
There were pines there three hundred feet to the first limb !"&#xD;
"That is impossible. If you exaggerate in that way, III can't&#xD;
believe your fortune story-"&#xD;
"Those three hundred feet ones had no limbs. Without&#xD;
exaggeration, they were the tallest pine trees that I ever saw,&#xD;
and the shaft was as straight as an arrow, but little sm~iler&#xD;
at the limbs than at the root-you understand ?"&#xD;
"Be done with your 'understand,' and go ahead I"&#xD;
Vaughan begins to grow excited.&#xD;
"Only sixty miles-two days' drive-from San Francisco&#xD;
were shingles enough to cover a continent, and worth, when&#xD;
rived out, one hundred dollars a thousand! I was astounded&#xD;
that no onp had thought of working the forest up into one&#xD;
hundred dollar lumps: it would beat the mines. My reso-&#xD;
lution was taken at once and I was so afraid that some onc&#xD;
would be before me, and pre~mpt upon my forest and shingle-&#xD;
yard, that IF nearly ran my mules down trotting to the city.&#xD;
IF ~~as afraid to motion it even to my best friends."&#xD;
While telling 'it he became so much interested as to forget&#xD;

bacco.\ Vaughan was more excited than he, if any thing;&#xD;
and, unable to Irook the delay, called out,&#xD;
"Confound it, go on, or someboQy will think of it, and get&#xD;
there before."&#xD;
"IF bought ~ny hoes, axes, cross-cut saws, wedges, drawing-&#xD;
knives, and all other implements needed' in shingle~making.;&#xD;
bought another team and wagon, and prepared to start. A&#xD;
boss-carpenter, with a large building contract on hand, seeing&#xD;
my preparations, and suspecting my object, wanted to make&#xD;
a contract wit~ me to furnish him a million shingles at&#xD;
seventy-five doll\irs per thousand; but I declined."&#xD;
"Why the thunder did n't you take him up ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING    FOR AMUSEMENT.             103&#xD;
"IF knew I could do better. IF asked him one hundred&#xD;
dollars per thousand."&#xD;
"And lost all by your avarice !"&#xD;
"Not a bit of it. I knew that I could sell all IF could&#xD;
make for mare than seventy-five dollars per thousand. IF&#xD;
determined to so arrange it that my teams would take a load&#xD;
of provisions to the mines and bring a load of shingles back,&#xD;
which would enable me to haul cheaper than others, and&#xD;
thus monopolize the hauling business, which was itself very&#xD;
profitable. I hired some men to aid in the business, and&#xD;
found that, after completing my arrangements, IF was some-&#xD;
thing i'n debt; but that was nothing with .such a splendid&#xD;
prospect before me for an overgrown fortune."&#xD;
"Certainly not. You did n't take sick ~" Vaughan asked,&#xD;
not seeing how he could otherwise have failed to realize a&#xD;
tremendous fortune.&#xD;
"No, IF did n't get sick. Glorious prospect, was n't it !"&#xD;
"Splendid! Somebody ahead of you ?"&#xD;
"TIa-a-a-awk, no."&#xD;
"Go ahead, man, I am getting excited."&#xD;
"All things ready, next morning, bright and early, I started&#xD;
with my teams and men to the forest; and just before sun-&#xD;
down on the second day we arrived. I selected a beautiful&#xD;
level spot for my operations, where the trees were so thick&#xD;
that a year's work of my men would hardly make an opening,&#xD;
and the tallest, prettiest trees you ever saw. IF do not ex-&#xD;
aggerate in saying that a majority of them would have&#xD;
measured from sixty to eighty and a hundred feet in the&#xD;
shaft, and nearly the same size all the way. There were&#xD;
shingles enough on one, even at Bluff City prices, to' make a&#xD;
fortune of a fabulous size."&#xD;
"Why did n't you go to work instead of star-gazing?"&#xD;
"I was in no hurry. I took a sort of delicious pleasure&#xD;

my fortune. We pitched our tent, fed the mules, cooked&#xD;
and ate supper, and I lay down to dream of pine-trees, shin&#xD;
gles, and millionaires. By daylight the next morning I had&#xD;
my men all up, and by the time II cooked breakfast, they had&#xD;
a tree cut down, and several cuts sawed off. Breakfast eaten,&#xD;
I had a cut rolled out, and slapped the wedge into it myself.&#xD;
I wanted to strike the first lick toward my fortune. I let&#xD;
drive at it, and the d-d thing would n't split !"&#xD;
"By 'the eternal !" exclaimed Vaughan, bounding up,&#xD;
"why did n't you try anotfrer ?"&#xD;
"By the eternal, I did I"&#xD;
"And another I"&#xD;
"I did."&#xD;
"And they would n't split ?"&#xD;
"No, sir, they would u't split I"&#xD;
"That was very near a fortune, sure enough! Wh ~t did&#xD;
you then ?"&#xD;
"Got drunk as a beast. Come, let us take a drink, and&#xD;
I '11 go to bed, if the Colonel will give me a place to sleep."&#xD;
"What did you do with your teams ?"&#xD;
"Sold them, and paid my debts."&#xD;
"Then what ?"&#xD;
"Kept tavern."&#xD;
"Kept tavern I"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, kept tavern! I made money at that, and would&#xD;
have continued at it if it had not been 'for Dick Bowie."&#xD;
"Why, what did he do ?"&#xD;
"He wanted to shoot me, a~id I did n't want him to do it;&#xD;
and as he insisted on it, I thought I had better leave. Now,&#xD;
Colonel, you would have preferred being shot, but I had no&#xD;
ambition that way. 'Two bullets and a bragger' I can stand,&#xD;
if I have the 'age;' but there was nothing I could 'hold'&#xD;
that would have induced me to 'see' him after I once got out&#xD;
of his sight."&#xD;
&#xD;
105&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why not shoot him ?"&#xD;
"I wouldn't if I could; and I couldn't if I would. I went&#xD;
to California to keep from being shot, . and I could afford to&#xD;
come back for the same laudable purpose. I prefer your&#xD;
brandy, Colonel, to shooting or being shot. Butler says: 'It&#xD;
is as great a pleasure to be cheated as to cheat;' but I say, lit&#xD;
is as great a pleasure to be treated as to treat; understand,&#xD;

THERE was little or nothing of interest in the Court, and&#xD;
its session was soon closed, and lawyers returned home. The&#xD;
river was very high~~boOmingand great fears were ~nter-&#xD;
tamed of an overflow. It had been steadily rising for some&#xD;
time, and was nearly to the top of the levees; and negroes&#xD;
were kept ~upon the watch day and night to repair breaches,&#xD;
and watch the waters. Upon occasions like this, every thing&#xD;
yielded to the one all~overpowering feeling-even cards and&#xD;
wine. The planting and working the crops were mereW me-&#xD;
chanical. The great "father of waters," swollen to the&#xD;
brim, with the melted snow and the rains that had fallen in&#xD;
the vast valley between the Alleghany and Rocky Mountains,&#xD;
and that rushed in ten thQusand channels to this immense&#xD;
trunk, went roaring and foaming along, covered with drift-&#xD;
wood of eyery ~dnd. To look across the channel seemed&#xD;
higher, by some feet, than the frail earthen barrier that&#xD;
helped to bear u~ its waters. As neighbor met neighbor, the&#xD;
word of greeting was, invariably, "The river is still rising;"&#xD;
and the word of farewell at parting, "I am afraid we shall&#xD;

all be overflowed." Houses through the swamp were built&#xD;
upon high pillars, intended to meet a contingency like the&#xD;
one now apprehended. The banks of the river and lakes&#xD;
were the highest parts of the swamp; and hence, when the&#xD;
water once passed the front barrier it rushed madly into the&#xD;
back country, spreading out everywhere; a~nd the back&#xD;
planters were as much dependent upon the levees as those in&#xD;
the front. Day after day they rode to the river, and sat upon&#xD;
their horses and listened to the gurgle, and watched the flow&#xD;
of the mighty river. An overflow was the more dreaded,&#xD;
because it not only involved the loss of an entire crop-in&#xD;
itself an immense calainity-but fencing, live stock, and every&#xD;
movable thing not placed beyond the reach of the floQd. T~e&#xD;
water had risen to within a few inches of the top of the levee,&#xD;
an d rippled along its edge.&#xD;
"Well, Jacob," said Mr. Clarkson to the negro man, who&#xD;
had been watching the l9vee, and had come to report, "h~w&#xD;
now ?"&#xD;
"Still ris'n, master."&#xD;
"Made any new discoveries, Jacob ?"&#xD;
"Way up yonder, by Mr. Foster's hog-pen, whar de hogs&#xD;
and cattle had a path over de levee, and dey put dat new&#xD;
dirt, I'se afeard will break, sir; it looks mighty soft dar."&#xD;
"Good gracious, Jacob! Ned, run down and tell the ~over-&#xD;
seer to come here."&#xD;
When Mr. Blake rode up, Clarkson addressed him:&#xD;
"Mr. Blake, Jacob reports the giving way of the levee&#xD;
where it was repaired at the corner of Mr. Foster's field."&#xD;
"Yes; I have sent some hands up there to try and&#xD;
strengthen it."&#xD;
"Suppose you gallop up and see that they do it well; for&#xD;
if the levee should break, then it will overflow the whole&#xD;
country."&#xD;
"I was on my way up there when I met Ned."&#xD;

"Ride this way as you return, Mr. Blake."&#xD;
"Ned, catch a horse and take a note to Mr. Gibson. I&#xD;
promised to send ~him any news that might be important; anI&#xD;
if the levee should break there it would cut him off from the&#xD;
rivci~, and he and his family be either lost or seriously en-&#xD;
dangered."&#xD;
The note was written and Ned dispatched.&#xD;
Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson walked the gallery in suspense and&#xD;
anxiety.&#xD;
"Wife! we had better ~ot delay any longer. I shall hail&#xD;
the first boat and put you and the children aboard of her, and&#xD;
send you to Bluff City."&#xD;
"What, and leave you here ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, my dear wife. Why not? It may not over-&#xD;
flow, and then there will be no danger to any of us; anclif&#xD;
it does, the danger will be greatly lessened by having you and&#xD;
the children in a place of safety."&#xD;
"0! I can't think of it! I cannot go and leave you&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"Nonsense, wife The' children must go, and you must&#xD;
go with them; they can't go by themselves."&#xD;
"But why, husband, do you not go with us; why risk your&#xD;
life when it is so precious to your family ?"&#xD;
"'For the best reason in the world, as you ought to feel.&#xD;
There are one hundred and twenty souls on this place for&#xD;
whom I am responsible, and II cannot abandon them to the&#xD;
mercy of a paid man, who has his own wife and children to&#xD;
look after, and himself to care for. As good a man and as&#xD;
'trusty as he i~, may he not, in looking to thi~s first call upon.&#xD;

of the devouring flood? and who could blame him? No,&#xD;

"I did not think of the poor negroes at the moment; my&#xD;
thoughts were of you. I see it all now-.you ought to ~tay,&#xD;
and II ought to go. I will get the children ready, and be pre-&#xD;
pared to take the first boat."&#xD;
Apprehensive of the overflow, Mrs. Clarkson' had had every&#xD;
0*&#xD;
thing so arranged that she could mQve at an hour~ s warning'&#xD;
Whatever was needed at Bluff City was packed for travel,&#xD;
and the balance put in a condition to remov~ to the upper&#xD;
rooms, should the water rise as high as the first floor. Before&#xD;
leaving, Mrs. Clarkson said:&#xD;
"Husband, let us go around to see the Hermit; he has but&#xD;
little to keep him here, and perhaps we can prevail on him&#xD;
to accompany me to the city."&#xD;
"Very well. I am glad you suggested it. Let us go im-&#xD;
mediately."&#xD;
When they arrived at the cottage, Mr. Q~rkson approached&#xD;
the Hermit most kindly, and said:&#xD;
"My friend~ we have come to try and persuade you to go&#xD;
down to the city with my wife and children, and make my&#xD;
house your home until the rise in the waters shall subside, or&#xD;
all apprehensions of an overflow are passed. My negroes and&#xD;
Mr. Blake are now engaged in strengthening the levee at&#xD;
Mr. Foster's field, where serious fears are entertained of a&#xD;
crevasse; and should it occur, your place will be sub-&#xD;
merged."&#xD;
The old man looked at him for a moment without resp~nd-&#xD;
ing in any way. But he was evidently less absorbed than&#xD;
usual, or rather his thoughts were not inward. The ever-&#xD;
present, all-prevailing thought had affected him as well as&#xD;
others. Here was a feeling greater than sorrow, and things&#xD;
that could only feel, and never thought, felt it. It pervaded&#xD;
the atmosphere: the cattle felt it,. and lay late around the&#xD;
pen in the morning, grazed near the house, coming up early,&#xD;

and going about lowing as before a storm. The dogs felt it,&#xD;
and howled; the insects that burrowed in the earth felt it,~&#xD;
and built upon higher spots of ground; the unlettered wood-&#xD;
chopper felt it, and felled hi~ tii~bers upon the highest brakes;&#xD;
and the ilermit felt it, and feeling it, he was upon a par with&#xD;
his fellow-man.&#xD;
"I thank you, Mr. Clarkson," he said, more blandly than&#xD;
usual; "but see," to a small hole in the ground, sur-&#xD;
rounded by a deposit peculiar to a certain swamp-worm, "that&#xD;
little untaught insect is my water-gauge. He knows more&#xD;
about the footsteps of the water-god than the philosopher or&#xD;
levee-builder. The water will reach him, but will not go be-&#xD;
yond; and that will not reach the upper step of my cottage."&#xD;
"1~KIIy dear sir, you surely will not trust to that worm&#xD;
"Yes, with more confidence than to man."&#xD;
"But even then your place will be overflowed."&#xD;
"I expect that; but my floor will be dry."&#xD;
"You do not mean to say you intend remaining in your&#xD;
house with the water all under it ?"&#xD;
"Ido."&#xD;
~"What will you do for provisions?&#xD;
* "I ha~ve provided for that."&#xD;
"My dear sir, let me persuade you to accompany my wife&#xD;
and children to Bluff City."&#xD;
"Is it for the sake of your wife and children you ask this&#xD;
of me?"&#xD;
"No; but for your own comfort and safety I most earn-&#xD;
estly wish it."&#xD;
"I cannot go."&#xD;
"Is there nothing I can do for you ?"&#xD;
"Nothing."&#xD;
"May Lnot send some one to help you prepare for the ap-&#xD;
proaching calamity-to help save your little stock, etc. ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"No."&#xD;
"Sir, allow me to assure you of the very deep interest I&#xD;
takin you."&#xD;
"Certainly."&#xD;
"I owe much to you, more than figures will count. You&#xD;
have done for me what I was unable to do for myself; and&#xD;
rebuked a father's love for his child, by perilling youi' own&#xD;
life in his presence to save her, my daughter. Had any one&#xD;
else performed an act so far beyond me, it would have humi~&#xD;
hated me, but not so with you. I have seen you day by day,&#xD;
week by week, month by month, and year by year, wearing&#xD;
away life and a powerful frame in silence and solitude, brodd-&#xD;
ing apparently over some great sad secret, and I have not&#xD;
attempted nor desired to probe it; your grief, if it be grief;&#xD;
is as far beyond my sympathy as your undaunted courage is&#xD;
beyond mine, and is scornful of my pity; and in time of&#xD;
peril, doubt, and terror, I see you rise in grandeur almost to&#xD;
a divinity, and the very elements yield to you, and at your&#xD;
touch relax their hold upon one dQar to me as life; and&#xD;
now that all are'~ alarmed, and anxiously preparing to avoid&#xD;
a danger they cannot brave, you appear indifferent, and push&#xD;
*       back the hand reached out to help you."&#xD;
The countenance of the old man softened, and grasping&#xD;
the hand of Colonel Clarkson, he said:&#xD;
"Do not misunderstand me. I am in no need of assist-&#xD;
ance now; if I were, Ii would not hesitate to accept yours so&#xD;
kindly offered."&#xD;
Clarkson was silent a few moments, and then said:&#xD;
"My friend, I feel a deep interest in you.&#xD;
"And I in you and yours," said the Hermit; "more than&#xD;
mere words can express."&#xD;
"I wish I could prevail upon -you to go down with my&#xD;
family to the city. You may sicken and die here with the&#xD;
water all around you, even under youm' house.&#xD;

The Hermit only shook his head. It was useless to trouble&#xD;
him further, and as a boat was expected every moment, they&#xD;
hurried back, signalled her, and Mrs. Clarkson, with her&#xD;
children and servants, went aboard.&#xD;
Toward evening Mr. Blake came along, and called to re-&#xD;
port the work on the levee. In ansWer to Colonel Clarkson's&#xD;
inquiries, he replied: "We have checked it, and it may&#xD;
stand. I. have had the dirt well rammed and sodded, bat I&#xD;
am afraid the new dirt will melt, and give way."&#xD;
"Have you left any one there to watch it ?"&#xD;
"Yes; I left Jim and Abe; they seem to understand it."&#xD;
"Are the stock-boats in order?'&#xD;
"All but one, and Silas is c6rking that."&#xD;
"How about the skiffs ?"&#xD;
"They are all tight, I think. I have had theni filled with&#xD;
water for several days."&#xD;
"Is the corn where it will not be reached by the water ?"&#xD;
"A part of it; and Ii will put the trash-gang"-a name for&#xD;
the women and children usually employed in the lighter&#xD;
work about the plantation-" to throwing it into the loft im-&#xD;
mediately."&#xD;
"The stock had better be all collected together, had n't&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
"It won't hurt."&#xD;
"Better do it; better be too cautious than not enough;&#xD;
for, if t1~e overflow comes, it will be like losing a double crop&#xD;
to tos~ my stock, especially my mules. But above all tfrings,&#xD;
Mr. Bkike make every arrangement for the safety of the ne-&#xD;
gro~s. Let the mothers with the children be especially cared&#xD;
for; they will be as helpless as infants, and I fear lose all&#xD;
presence of mind, as they almost always do in time of dan-&#xD;
ger."&#xD;
"I have conversed with them, but they answer me only&#xD;
with a 'wild stare, not seeming. to comprehend more than&#xD;

half I say. You can do more with 'them, Colon&#xD;
time, than I."                            el, at such a&#xD;
"Perhaps so. At all events, I am here to do all I&#xD;
can."&#xD;
In all this energy and bustle, one would hardly recog-&#xD;
nize the idle, careless, time-killing Mr. Clarkson of a week&#xD;
before. He went to each negro-cabin, and saw that each one&#xD;
had his or her things in a condition to throw them into&#xD;
a boat at a moment's warning; giving proper instructions&#xD;
to the nurse who had charge of the children; and attended&#xD;
to a thousand little things which would necessarily have es-&#xD;
caped the attention of the overseer, whose mind was occupied&#xD;
with the weightier plantation matters.&#xD;
A day or two passed, and hope-.-not exactly hope either,&#xD;
but something ahnost akin to hope-began to be indulged&#xD;
that there might not be an overflow after all. Reports from&#xD;
the upper rivers were favorable, and each report was sought&#xD;
for with great eagerness. The rise in the river within the&#xD;
past twenty-four hours was only about one-fourth of an inch.&#xD;
Neighbors meet and talk, and look anxious. The succeeding&#xD;
twenty-four hours was a stand-still. What was almost hope&#xD;
before was now confirmed and full-blown. Conversation be-&#xD;
came more cheerful, price-currents talked over; and the next&#xD;
day, joy of joys, the river had receded an inch. Prospects&#xD;
of the crops were now discussed, their progress, etc.; rides&#xD;
were taken up and down the river, new gauge-pegs set, and&#xD;
old ones examined, and all break up with a 'general drink~&#xD;
and a strong inclination for a game.&#xD;
They retire, however, early; but late at night the roar&#xD;
and rushing sound is heard, and, upon running out, they'&#xD;
find themselves ankle-deep in water. The bell was rung to&#xD;
arouse the sleeping negroes, boats~ made ready, and such a&#xD;
hurrying to and fro, lowing of cattle, squealing of pigs, hal-&#xD;
looing at negroes, driving and whooping at mules, as made&#xD;

&#xD;
confusion worse confounded, beggars description. Babel,&#xD;
with its jargon of tongues, could not have been worse. Mr.&#xD;
Blake and Clarkson did all that men could do. The infants&#xD;
and lesser children were ordered to be conveyed to the nurse-&#xD;
house, where they could be taken care of and kept safely&#xD;
until morning; but each mother, true to her instincts, seized&#xD;
her brood and ran with them hither and thither, screaming&#xD;
like mad, and would listen to no one but their master. The&#xD;
mules would n't go into the boats, the cattle would n't go&#xD;
into the boats, and the hogs would n't go into the boats. The&#xD;
water was rapidly rising, and swept past; like a mill-race; and&#xD;
it was found that the boats had not been supplied with proper&#xD;
cables. Clarkson and the overseer, and such of the negro&#xD;
men as had presence of mind enough to do any thing, worked&#xD;
all night in water, and by morning succeeded in getting such&#xD;
of the stock as could be controlled into the boats; but much&#xD;
the larger portion were left to perish.&#xD;
Morning came, and as far as the eye could reach was one&#xD;
wide sea of wild water. The break had occurred at the&#xD;
weak place at Mr. Foster's levee ; and the water continued&#xD;
rising until it covered the whole face of the country from&#xD;
one to thirty feet, with only here and there an island. Abor-&#xD;
tive efforts were made to secure some of the stock that had&#xD;
escaped the night before, but all were useless. There was no&#xD;
high land back to which the stock could be shipped, and&#xD;
they were obliged to be taken to Bluff City, the nearest high&#xD;
land on the river; and to do this 'the boats had to~ be carried&#xD;
through the crevasse, a thing that seemed almost impossible.&#xD;
But the stock could not stay cribbed up in those small,&#xD;
crowded boats all fhe spring and summer, and an effort had&#xD;
to be made.&#xD;
A boat of fourteen mules was first tried. It was towed up&#xD;
to the crevasse, and means taken to carry it through; bat as&#xD;
soon as the roaring current struck it it wa~ jerked away, up-&#xD;
&#xD;

set, and carried off mules and all, like so much cork. This,&#xD;
it was soon seen, ~rould never do; and it was thought that&#xD;
a steamboat could approach near enough to th~ levee to rest&#xD;
its staging on it, and the boats could be brought alongside,&#xD;
and the stock transferred across the levee to the steamer. A&#xD;
boat was accordingly hailed, and attempted to land, but she&#xD;
stopped steam too quickly, and began rounding in too high&#xD;
up, and, drifting into the current, was driven furiously ashore.&#xD;
A scene of terror as wild as the waters ensued, but fortunately&#xD;
no lives were lost. The boat, however, was wrecked, or rather&#xD;
thrown where ~he became a wreck.&#xD;
The stock were finally taken down the levee to a point&#xD;
where a steamer could approach sufficiently near to get them&#xD;
on board, and, with the negroes, they were taken to Bluff&#xD;
City.&#xD;
Through the whole trying scene Col. Clarkson had been&#xD;
the true master. His loss was great, and but for his being&#xD;
present, it would have been doubled, as he must have lost&#xD;
many of the servants, whom terror had rendered insubordi-&#xD;
nate. Through fear and the habit of obedience, they had&#xD;
always listened to the commands of the overseer; but in the&#xD;
presence of a greater fear, they paid no attention to him, and&#xD;
were as intractable as the frightened horses. And here it was&#xD;
that Ccl. Clarkson's aid was so efficient. The more timid would&#xD;
cling up to their master, and, at his voice, come running to&#xD;
catch and obey his slightest wish, whilst they would skit&#xD;
about like scared chickens at the orders given by the over-&#xD;
scer.&#xD;
Cla~kson felt all the responsibility of a master, and his&#xD;
noble nature never perhaps stood more boldly out from the&#xD;
careless habits of the m ~re lover of pleasure than at this&#xD;
time. He was ever kind txnd just 2to his slaves, and almost&#xD;
worshipped by them in return. Master was every thing to&#xD;
them; and master's wife and master's children the extent,&#xD;

the sum and essence of life, the boundary of the world, so&#xD;
far as they were concerned. And he deserved it all, for&#xD;
whatever else he might have failed in as a useful citizefi, in&#xD;
this respect he had performed his whole duty. As he saw&#xD;
the last negro safe on board, his heart lightened, and he&#xD;
silently thanked God that no lives had been lost. He thought&#xD;
of Amy, too, and knew she would bless him for his kindly&#xD;
watch and care over so many helpless human beings. They&#xD;
were all safe now; and as he stood a moment upon the plank&#xD;
on which he was to pass to the boat, forgetting the present,&#xD;
and thinking over the pa t three days, the plank slipped, and&#xD;
he was plunged headlong into the flood. The cry and bellow&#xD;
that went up from a hund ed pair of lungs, "Master 's over-&#xD;
board! master 's drowned I" was frightful to listen to, when&#xD;
Abe, a tall, muscular fe low, dashed through the crowd,&#xD;

SHAKSPEAILE.&#xD;
&#xD;
COLONEL CLARRSON and family spent the summer season&#xD;
on the Gulf Coast. The sea-breeze, fishing, bathing, and&#xD;
yachting, were all fine, and the company, generally, select.&#xD;
There was an at-homeativeness there that one does not feel&#xD;
farther from home, where faces, manners, and scenes are new&#xD;
and strange. Mrs. Corbin and her daughter Clara and Frank&#xD;
Vaughan were among the visitors, and Duke John, one of&#xD;
the notables, or rather the notable-the observed of all ob-&#xD;
servers. He had a handsome person in addition to his title, was&#xD;
pretty as a lady's page, and, being a half invalid, was petted&#xD;
and caressed by the ladies, feasted by the gentlemen, and&#xD;
toadied to by the whole family of Verysofts. Miss Clara was&#xD;
all smiles and made immeasurably happy at seeing her diamond&#xD;
ring upon his finger~tl~e finger upon which she herself had&#xD;
placed it.&#xD;
In his partnership transactions on the Duke's account,&#xD;
Vaughan was thrown so often in company with the mother&#xD;
and daughter; and as the daughter was thought worthy a&#xD;
Duke's regard by the Duke himself and the Duke's discern-&#xD;
mont of character was so appreciative and correct-his regard&#xD;

&#xD;
for Vaughan, for instane-that he began to place Clara up~on&#xD;
an equality with the Duke himself-something quite removed&#xD;
from the great herd of ladies who sought their summer pas-.&#xD;
turing in the Duke's smiles, and was accordingly strongly&#xD;
tempted to become the rival of the Duke for her hand. In&#xD;
the great prize lottery, he considered himself one of the&#xD;
largest figure-upon an exact par with the Duke, though he&#xD;
thought the Duke a figure above anybody else, lie was just&#xD;
as good..looking-he would say to himsclf-dresscd in as good&#xD;
taste, danced as well, and was equally gifted in the small talk&#xD;
that pleased the small people that spent their small change at&#xD;
small watering-places. The only difference between him and&#xD;
the Duke was, that the Duke was a Duke and he was not;&#xD;
though he deserved to be. He had not always thought him-&#xD;
self so much higher than other~ men, and did so then out of&#xD;
compliment to the .Duke's discernment, he having regarded&#xD;
Vaughan alone of all the men of the Republic as worthy to&#xD;
bp received upon terms of str'ctest intimacy. The purse of&#xD;
Vaughan &amp;amp; Co. was the only ne in the country he would&#xD;
condescend to share; an the, oak of Frank Vaughan, Esq.,&#xD;
was the only cloak lie had deemed at all worthy to mantle his&#xD;
shoulders when in distress; and his pride-his ducal pride,&#xD;
something -decided ly above the vulgar-revolted, at the&#xD;
thought of being under obligations of a pecuniary character&#xD;
to any other brokers than those of Vaughan &amp;amp; Co. This&#xD;
magic "Co." had the effect to nfake all the members of the&#xD;
firm equal; and as things that are equal to the same thing are&#xD;
equal to each other; and as the junior was equal to the&#xD;
Duke-in the .Duke's estimation-shown by his wearing the&#xD;
ring; and as Frank was equal to the Duke-in his own es-&#xD;
timation-it followed that the junior must be equal to Frank.&#xD;
State the case as he might, the demonstration was clear, and&#xD;
his conviction firm, that the junior would do. Upon the&#xD;
whole, it was settled in his mind, that unless the Duke made&#xD;
&#xD;
a confidant of him in relation to Miss Clara--and he preferred&#xD;
that he should not-he would try and cut the Duke out and&#xD;
take her himself. This thing determined upon, he deemed&#xD;
it only requisite that the elecision should be made known to&#xD;
the junior to secure a stronger bond of partnership between&#xD;
two of the members of the firm of Vaughan &amp;amp; Co.&#xD;
Full of this idea, and desperately determined to take the&#xD;
junior's heart by storm, and her captive, he arrayed himself&#xD;
in his best; had his barber arrange his hair'-in the most kill-&#xD;
ing manner; his kids were of the finest quality and highly&#xD;
perfumed. Like the "certain lord" that demanded Hotspur's&#xD;
prisoners, he was&#xD;
"Neat, trimly dressed;&#xD;
a Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reaped;&#xD;
Hie was perfumed like. a milliner;-&#xD;
Ad 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held&#xD;
A panneet box, which ever and anon&#xD;
- He gave his nose and took 't away again."&#xD;
And thus armed, " with many holiday and lady terms," he&#xD;
started to demand a surrender. What might have been the&#xD;
result of such a formal business visit, under circumstances&#xD;
less flattering to the junior than were those by which she&#xD;
was then surrounded, may have been a matter of doubt.&#xD;
His success upon occasions in some respects similar, would&#xD;
have encouraged his friends to hope for the best. His&#xD;
fine looks, fine clothes, and fine hair, were regarded as&#xD;
powerful batteries in Cupid's wars, when conducting a siege&#xD;
upon a young lady's heart; especially when under the direc-&#xD;
tion of one with the reputation of having stormed many&#xD;
such fortresses and come off without a scar. IFew hearts&#xD;
could have resisted such an assault as was contemplated;&#xD;
and no hope could have been entertained for the junior's&#xD;
if it had not been well fortified and defended by vanity,&#xD;

pride, and folly; ready "to do or die" under the command&#xD;
of the Duke.&#xD;
It had never occurred to Frank, that while he had all this&#xD;
time~ been looking at the junior through the end of the fash-&#xD;
ionable telescope, which n~agnifled the junior to huge propor-&#xD;
tions, she was looking back at him from the other end, which&#xD;
diminished him in equal proportions, and reduced him to the&#xD;
dimensions of a lilliputian. To her, his marching up to rout&#xD;
the Duke, was like a bantam strutting and showing his fine&#xD;
feathers in the presence of his Imperial Majesty of Shanghai:&#xD;
the very pullets mock his presumption, and his Majesty walks&#xD;
right over him, holding his head at an immeasurable distance&#xD;
above; and though the little felloW goes strutting and quirk-&#xD;
ing off it is evident to all he has had his "comb cut."&#xD;
The junior of the firm of Vaughan &amp;amp; 0o was a long time&#xD;
in answering the qard of Frank Vaughan, Esq.; and, as he&#xD;
~at admiring himself, and rising, in his own estimation, each&#xD;
minute, his complacency was refreshing. The citadel had,&#xD;
of course, surrendered without a struggle, and the junior&#xD;
would herself bring the keys unannounced, and was arraying&#xD;
herself in that magnificent dress he had so much admired&#xD;
upon a former visit in company with the Duke, and which he&#xD;
had thought so becoming to her, and which the Duke even&#xD;
condescended to praise. Yes; and she was having her maid,&#xD;
Grisette, dress her hair in that admixture of* curls and&#xD;
braids which she alone knew how to arrange, and which he&#xD;
and the Duke had so highly complimented; and all this was&#xD;
being done for him! Upon former occasions-as he had&#xD;
always called with the Duke-it was uncertain for whom she&#xD;
had thus arrayed herself, but now it was being done for him!&#xD;
Ravishing thought! The pleasure which it gave him told&#xD;
how much he had feared defeat, without admitting it to him-&#xD;
eelf. Skilful generally, as he was, he allowed the certainty&#xD;
of victory to put him off his guard, and, in the confident cx-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
pectation of the keys, was not prepared for a sortie. A foot&#xD;
was heard-.~-a slight rustle of petticoats~he is right! itis&#xD;
the junior coming, unannounced, to deliver up the keys!&#xD;
He placed himself in the most imposing attitude. The door&#xD;
opened, and 0, ye powers of war! what a battery was opened&#xD;
on him! He was riddled; literally shivered to pieces! The&#xD;
junior stood before him in the very plainest calico wrapper,&#xD;
her hair in papers, and her pretty feet pushe I into a pair of&#xD;
her mother's old slippers! but charming, i~i spite of her&#xD;
undress.&#xD;
It was cruel to have taken such an advantage of his un-&#xD;
guarded condition, to open on him in that way. Such a&#xD;
sortie was not only disproportioned to the siege, but the&#xD;
weapons were unheard - of in civilized warfare. He was&#xD;
skilled in "fence," and was ready to parry any ordinary&#xD;
weapons; such, for instance, as "Ma and pa had arranged&#xD;
differently," "Too young to think of such things," "Time t~&#xD;
reflect," "Prc~ngagement," etc., but entire indifference! an&#xD;
absence of all suspicion that an attack was even contem~&#xD;
plated, much less that one had been made-it was too bad!&#xD;
"Excuse my dishabille," she began, "you came at such au&#xD;
unseasonable hour; I-.-"&#xD;
"Why, it is--"&#xD;
"0, I know; but I told that stupid servant that I was not&#xD;
at home to visitors until half-past six o'clock, when I expected&#xD;
the Duke. 0, Frank! is n't he a love of a man&#xD;
Frank's guns were all spiked. He was a prisoner of war,&#xD;
and was silent.&#xD;
There stood pretty Clara (lorbin, holding the door-knob&#xD;
with one hand, and the edge of the door with the other,&#xD;
leaning her weight slightly on h ~r hands, the door half ajar,&#xD;
and gave no invitation to Frank ~aughan4 Esq., to be seated,&#xD;
nor offered to take a seat herself; but looking for all the&#xD;
world as if waiting for a message:&#xD;

&#xD;
Dear Frank," she said, in that sort of tone one says,&#xD;
ear sonny," or "Dear buddy," "you will excuse me, I&#xD;
k ow. It will soon be time to expect the Duke; and I was&#xD;
i the act of dressing to i'eceive him when you came, a:ad&#xD;
that stupid servant brought up sour card. I felt bound to&#xD;
come down. That was what made me keep you waiting so&#xD;
long. You will excuse me, I know, dear Prank; and I must&#xD;
go and dress."&#xD;
So saying, and bowing gracefully, she left Frank standing&#xD;
in the floor.&#xD;
She had no more malice than a child, and was as light as&#xD;
the feather one takes in his fingers and puffs off in the wind,&#xD;
and as giddy as butterflies of fashion usually are; but, with~&#xD;
out intending it, during the interview she had, in the most&#xD;
quiet way imaginable, turned the fashionable telescope around,&#xD;
and presented to Frank's eye the end through which the&#xD;
public looked at him. He saw himself; and as soon as he&#xD;
discovered th~it the little tonitit of a thing he was looking&#xD;
was himself, he dropped the telescope and went to his&#xD;
room, a bantam with his fine tail-fe~thers pulled out, and&#xD;
comb badly cut.&#xD;
To add to his mortification, he had been in his room but a&#xD;
short time, when he saw Miss Clara whirled past in a buggy&#xD;
with the Duke, beautifully dressed, with her hair in the style&#xD;
he had so much admired.&#xD;
Mrs. Corbin was not altogether satisfied with the slow pro-&#xD;
gress the Duke and Clara were making in their courtship.&#xD;
She had flattered herself that she would 'have been the&#xD;
mother-in-law of a Duke ere that time; and that evening,&#xD;
after the ride, she called Clara into her room, with the&#xD;
view of arranging plans to bring the Duke to an avowal of&#xD;
his intentions:&#xD;
"It is high time, Clara, that the Duke had openly declared&#xD;
his purpose with respect to you. His attentions have been&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
123&#xD;
&#xD;
as marked as if you w~re engaged; and everybody believes&#xD;
you ~re engaged~ and it will deter other suitors; and you&#xD;
must so manage it that he will be forced to declare his in-&#xD;
tentions."&#xD;
"How am I to do it? If he wont ask me to have h&#xD;
how am I to make him ?"&#xD;
"Easy enough, you simpleton, you. Frank Vaughan is&#xD;
dying to offer his hand to you now. I saw him in one of.th~&#xD;
mirrors, this evening, without his knowing it, when he sat in&#xD;
the parlor, waiting for you to come down; and all that fixing&#xD;
and primping and strutting meant more than a desire to make&#xD;
a good appearance before one he knew as well and had seen&#xD;
as often as he has you. Then why come alone? A man&#xD;
who sticks as close to the Duke as he does, would not leave&#xD;
him to make a visit alone, if the visit was intended as a mere&#xD;
commonplace. Mark my word, he had his reason for wishing&#xD;
to see you alone; and do you, the next time you meet with&#xD;
him in the company of the Duke, affect to be entertained by&#xD;
Vaughan, and let your attentions to him be so marked as&#xD;
attract the Duke's notice; and you inlay trust to Vaughan to&#xD;
opening the eyes of the Duke to his designs: he will not&#xD;
be able to conceal it~."&#xD;
"XVhy, ma! why did n't you tell me that before? I treated&#xD;
Mr. Vaughan in such a way this evening, he'll never come&#xD;
back here ao~ain I'm afraid."&#xD;
"Never do you fear. ITo will think more of you than he&#xD;
ever did. He prized himself before; he will prize you&#xD;
now."&#xD;
She was right. Vaughan had not been able to think of&#xD;
any thing else but her, after his visit. He found himself all&#xD;
the while arguing: "She would not have appeared before&#xD;
the Duke hi that attitude; and then did n't she say, 'Dear&#xD;
Frank,' as if I were her brother? The Duke may have her&#xD;
fancy, but I have her confidence-..--her. sisterly regard; and&#xD;

&#xD;
if I do not make something out of~it, my name is not Frank."&#xD;
With this resolve, he found himself calling for Miss Clara&#xD;
much sooner than even the mother suspected. It had the&#xD;
effect of distressing Mrs. Corbin with another fear. She&#xD;
wanted Clara to have two strings to her bow, and did not&#xD;
wish this string pulled until the other broke; and Vaughan was&#xD;
hastening matters so rapidly that she did not well see bow&#xD;
Clara could continue to encourage him much longer without&#xD;
a declaration from him; and this she was anxious to defer&#xD;
until the iDuke disclosed his designs; and Vaughan, anxious&#xD;
to see her alone, and prosecute his suit, would not call in&#xD;
company with the Duke, so as to excite the desired jealousy&#xD;
on the Duke's part,&#xD;
Things were in this attitude, when a change caine o'er the&#xD;
spirit of the mother's dream, which the following conversa-&#xD;
tion between mother and daughter will explain:&#xD;
"Clara, if Frank Vaughan proposes, do you take him; but&#xD;
bring the Duke to terms, if you can."&#xD;
"Why do you wish me to take Mr. Vaughan, mother ?"&#xD;
"Because I don't want both birds to fly. Mrs. St. Cloud&#xD;
is just here from Washington City, and I learn insinuates&#xD;
that the Duke is no Duke after all. I don't believe a word&#xD;
she says, the manoeuvring old thing. I just expected that&#xD;
as soon as every thing was arranged, and the Duke was about&#xD;
to propose, some such old marplot would come and put her&#xD;
foot in it. I suppose she wants the Duke for that doll-baby&#xD;
of hers, and she is afraid you will catch him before he knows&#xD;
she's out, and before she can practice her arts of innocence&#xD;
on him."&#xD;
"Alice St. Cloud! I 'd like to see her catch a Duke; poor,&#xD;
simple, foolish, affected thing ! It is all jealousy of Mrs. St.&#xD;
Cloud to be slandering the Duke. I shan't speak to her&#xD;
when II see her, and I'll tell the Duke not to do it. I'll show&#xD;
her what it is to be slandering her betters."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am glad you have some of your mother's spunk. But&#xD;
do you neVer mind Mrs. St. Cloud. I '11 teach her where&#xD;
she stands; do you bring Vaughan to terms the first chance&#xD;
you have, and make a chance if you can't do any better."&#xD;

MRS. ST. CLOUD, whose advent at the Coast promised so&#xD;
inauspiciously, was what might be termed a splendid-looking&#xD;
woman. She was large and well proportioned, above the&#xD;
medium height, dignified, and rather reserved, though 'very&#xD;
attractive in her manners; possessing that rare and happy&#xD;
faculty of making every one feel at ease in her society, and&#xD;
yet under sufficient restraint to avoid familiarity or freedom.&#xD;
There was a charm about her which always pleased, but never&#xD;
led astray; and it had often been remarked that he was a&#xD;
bad man indeed who did not feel himself benefited by her&#xD;
conversation. There was a purity, and honesty, and perfect&#xD;
fairness in her thoughts, which stole in upon the heart, win-&#xD;
ning the confidence of all, which the beautiful order of her&#xD;
life never forfeited when once obtained.&#xD;
She had been a widow for more than twelve years, and&#xD;
though her hand had been desired by many, none had ex-&#xD;
pressed the wish ,to here She was not wealthy, but had&#xD;
enough of this world's goods to supply her plaifi wants, and&#xD;
to support her daughter at one of the first institutions of&#xD;
learning in the country. Her husband, like Col. Clarkson,&#xD;
had been fond of cards and wine, but neither a drunkard nor&#xD;
gambler. One night in New Orleans, after sitting late at&#xD;

)lay with some friends, he stopped, on his way to his hotel, at&#xD;
restaurant for lunch, and was stabbed by a courtesan who&#xD;
mistook him for her faithless lover. He was borne bleeding&#xD;
nd in a dying state to his room, and the devoted, happy,&#xD;
i~usting wife of the day before was roused up at midnight,&#xD;
o see the husband of her young affections, and the father of&#xD;
I er lovely child, breathe his last without a parting word.&#xD;
All he did was to motion towards his daughter, gurgle an&#xD;
inarticulate word, and die-the victim of playing for amuse-&#xD;
ment and betting to count the game. The sad, broken-&#xD;
hearted mother needed not this mute but emphatic appeal&#xD;
to remind her of her duty to her child, to which her heart&#xD;
clung so fondly. And though for months, and even years,&#xD;
the floods of grief swept over her, at times almost carrying&#xD;
her down under the heavy pi~essure, and sunlight and shade,&#xD;
summer and winter went "darkling" by, the sight of her&#xD;
helpless daughter, so solemnly recommended to her care,&#xD;
afforded~ an incentive to action, and the young widow, by de-&#xD;
grees, rose superior to the gre at trouble which was almost&#xD;
crushing her to the earth. It was true that she looked oftener&#xD;
now away to the distant skies, and thought of the rest there&#xD;
prepared for the faithful, and sometimes longed for its sweet&#xD;
repose; but she neglected no duty here. She learned to look&#xD;
i~pon the world as it was, met it equably, and moving on in&#xD;
the even tenor of her life, "her ways were pleasantness, and&#xD;
all her paths were p9ace."&#xD;
She brought a lette~' from Agnes to her father and mother.&#xD;
A portion of it ran thus&#xD;
DEAR PARENTS :-.My kind, good teachers have given me&#xD;

pleasure to think about you, and tha1~ Mrs. St. Cloud will so&#xD;
soon see you, that I feel more like sitting and thinking and&#xD;

drying, than writing. I know it is wrong to cry, and I do&#xD;
not do it because I am unhappy; for I am just as happy as I&#xD;
can be away from: you.&#xD;
Mrs. St. Cloud has been staying here near dear Alice,, and&#xD;
would. not leave now, but she has met with a sad loss. Some&#xD;
one went to her trunk and stole her ring and watch that&#xD;
used to be worn by her husband, and on that account p:rized&#xD;
very much by her. The thief pretends to be some great body,&#xD;
and has gone down that way. And Pa, I want you to help&#xD;
her get the things back, because she is so sad about it~&#xD;
Dear sweet Alice is still my roommate. I love her more&#xD;
and more every day. She will leave school a year before I&#xD;
will.                  Your affectionate daughter,&#xD;
AGNES.&#xD;
am sorry to hear of your loss," Mr. Clarkson said, when&#xD;
he had read the letter and handed it to his wife. "A~gne~&#xD;
speaks of your having had some articles, much prized by you,&#xD;
stolen from your trunk. Have you any suspicion of the&#xD;
thief ?"&#xD;
"Ye~," replied Mrs. St. Cloud, "he passed himself off in&#xD;
Washi~gton City as the son of the Duke de Castro. And IL&#xD;
came here upon a report that there was a man in this place&#xD;
claiming that title."&#xD;
"There is such a man here, and he has turned the heads&#xD;
of all the women, an{ half the men. II will however make&#xD;
an exception of my wife, who has never been able to 'tolerate&#xD;
him, thDugh I cannot say tEe same for myself. Unless there-&#xD;
fore you have the clearest ?roof of his guilt, I would recoin-&#xD;
m~nd to you to proceed with great prudence, for the whole&#xD;
fashionable hive l~ere is interested in maintaining his respect-&#xD;
ability, and rumor says he is about to marry one of our IBluff&#xD;
City belles."&#xD;
"AhI who is tl~at ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING    FOR AMUSEMENT.             129&#xD;
"Miss Clara Corbin."&#xD;
"I should regret very much to interfere with any match&#xD;
her mother may have in view for her daughter; for let this&#xD;
K       pretended Duke turn out as he may, should I be the means&#xD;
of exposing him, I fear Mrs. Corbin, instead of thanking me&#xD;
for saving her child from a masked villain, would always cen-&#xD;
sure me for having defeated the match."&#xD;
"Too true, I fear."&#xD;
"If the articles lost were not relics, prized by me far above&#xD;
their intrinsic value, I should say nothing about them; but&#xD;
money cannot replace them, and let it affect whom it may, I&#xD;
must have them."&#xD;
"What course do you propose to pursue ?"&#xD;
"I wish, i1~ possible, to s~e some friend of his and demand&#xD;
the articles as the price of silence, and to avoid publicity and&#xD;
exposure so far as I can."&#xD;
"Then let me send for his intimate friend, Frank Vaughan.&#xD;
lie is more interested in avoiding a public exposure than any&#xD;
one else; for, in addition to his being his intimate friend, he&#xD;
introduced him here, and also to Mrs. Corbin."&#xD;
Mrs. St. Cloud assented, and Vaughan was sent for~ As&#xD;
soon as he came in, Mr. Clarkson said:&#xD;
"Vaughan, Mrs. St. Cloud has a matter of very grave im-&#xD;
port to converse with you about. She has had the misfor-&#xD;
tune to lose some articles of jewelry, which she thinks were&#xD;
stolen from her in Washinaton City.-a watch and 'ring,&#xD;
worn by her husband in l~is lifetime, and hence highly prized&#xD;
by her. She says they were stolen by a person calling him-&#xD;
self son of the iDuke de Castro, an~ hearing that an indi-&#xD;
vidual by that name was here, has come to z~scertain if he is&#xD;
the same."&#xD;
"My dear madam," said Vaughan, "I hope you do not&#xD;
I"&#xD;
intend to ruin yourself by insinuating any thing so disgra~.&#xD;
ful as that, of the young Duke John !"&#xD;

"I intend nothing personal to myself-certainly not my&#xD;
ruin. But I wish to get my property, and will do more than&#xD;
brave a duke's displcasu~e to regain it. I do not know&#xD;
whether the man who stole my-jewelry is the one who passes by&#xD;
that name here or not. If he be, his pretension to blood&#xD;
and title~ will not save him, unless he delivers up the articles&#xD;
stolen. In pursuit of relics, sacred tis those are to me, I&#xD;
cannot be frightened by exclamation-points."&#xD;
Vaughan felt rebuked, and said, by way of ap logy:&#xD;
"Madam; excuse my vehe~nence; I was startled at so grave&#xD;
a charge against so high a personage."&#xD;
"rdo not know," resumed Mrs. St. Cloud, "that he is the&#xD;
same. I have not seen him. The man I speak of is about&#xD;
your size, with small delicate hands, rather feminine features,&#xD;
and soft musical voice. He' complains of a wound re cived&#xD;
in battle, he says, and faints with great case and grace in the&#xD;
presence of ladies."&#xD;
"The same, madam, unquestionably. But there mtst be&#xD;
some mistake. Some adroit scoundrel has committed the&#xD;
deed, and managed to throw suspicion on the Duke."&#xD;
"There can be no mistake as to who opened my trunk,"&#xD;
replied Mrs. St. Cloud; "' the only question is; whether this&#xD;
is the man. All I desire, Mr. Vaughan, is to get~ possession&#xD;
again of the watch and ring; the trifle of money I[ care&#xD;
nothing about. You may mention my terms to him; and&#xD;
you may likewise say to him that flight is next to impossible,&#xD;
for I have a sentinel who will not let him escape. My coin-&#xD;
plaint is written out and ready to be sworn to, and unless my&#xD;
articles are forthcoming before to-morrow morning, he will&#xD;
be put under arrest."&#xD;
Vaughan, to use a Southernism, was thunderstruck. The&#xD;
calm, resolute woman had unsettled his faith in the immacu-&#xD;
lacy of his Duke. The possibility of his being an impostor&#xD;
began t9 force itself upon his 'credulity, whether he would or&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING Poa AMUSE~IENT               131&#xD;
not, and the part he had played, innocently enough, it is&#xD;
true, pressed upon him. But when he reflected upon the&#xD;
evidences of his genuineness, his recognition by officers and&#xD;
soldiers of the Mexican war, his letters from the leading men&#xD;
of the country, and his duke-like appearance, he felt that&#xD;
there could be no mistake.&#xD;
With these conflicting feelings, he called at the Duke's&#xD;
room. lIe explained, in as delicate a manner as possible,&#xD;
what he had heard from Mrs. St. Cloud, spoke of her high&#xD;
standing, etc., and was greatly relieved when Duke John&#xD;
laughed at the whole thing as a good joke, and proposed to&#xD;
visit Mrs. St. Cloud and undeceive her. lie went with the&#xD;
utmost cheerfulness to the sitting-room, but as 'he entered,&#xD;
Mrs. St. Cloud's large Newfoundland dog growled, and,&#xD;
rising up, walked deliberately up to the Duke and smelt of&#xD;
um, but, ~t a motion from his mistress, switched his tail&#xD;
sunk down his head and walled back, and, lying down, put&#xD;
his head between his outstretched paws, and kept his keen&#xD;
eye upon the Duke. Don John repeated in the most unem-&#xD;
barrassed manner what had just been told him; spoke of it&#xD;
as a trick played upon him by an impostor, of whom lie had&#xD;
heard before, but whose personations had heretofore always&#xD;
been of an amusing, pleasant character, this being the first&#xD;
time he had undertaken to personate him in any thing crim-&#xD;
inal; that so long as he had tried to personate him by acting&#xD;
the gentleman, or playing the harlequin, he felt disposed to&#xD;
let it pass, but as he had descended to infamy, and come&#xD;
so near involving him, he would take pains to have him&#xD;
Punished; was very sorry for the loss she had sustained, and&#xD;
regarded it as a duty he owed to her as well as himself to aid&#xD;
in regaining~ her property and punishing the thief~ and if&#xD;
she would be kind enough to give hjm a description of the&#xD;
impostor, he would take immediate steps to put the police on&#xD;
his track.&#xD;

"Sir," said Mrs. St. Cloud, with great deliberation, ~you&#xD;
have only to copy your reflection in the mirror to obtain the&#xD;
description you desire."&#xD;
This answer was like an electric shock to all except the&#xD;
Duke himself~ who remained perfectly composed, seeming&#xD;
rather to compassionate Mrs. St. Cloud than take ~offence at&#xD;
what she said.&#xD;
"Madam," he answered, in his soft, insinuating yoice~ with&#xD;
just enough of some sort of accent to give a pleasing effect,&#xD;
"you ver' severe."&#xD;
At the sound of his voice the Newfoundland got up, smelt&#xD;
of the Duke, and lay down again.&#xD;
"Outrageous I" exclaimed Mrs. Corbin. "Infamous! She&#xD;
1"&#xD;
ought to be scouted from society.&#xD;
"Ma, let us go," put in Clara, with her handkerchief to&#xD;
her face.&#xD;
"Nevar mm', my tear Mrs. Corbin, she pe in une grand&#xD;
distress I"&#xD;
The feeling of the company was all on the side of the&#xD;
Duke. The dog seemed to notice it-got up and stood beside&#xD;
his mistress. Mrs. St. Cloud was in no way disconcerted,&#xD;
but calm and resolute, and in the same deliberate tone&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"I am in no need of compassion: you are either the per~&#xD;
son who stole-"&#xD;
"Just hear the beldam 1" broke in Mrs. Corbin.&#xD;
"0, ma I" said the distressed Clara, "have you my sal-&#xD;

"Don't you i~aint here," said the mother; "this is no time&#xD;
for fainting ;" a~id rolling up her sleeves as if for action, ad-&#xD;
vanced a step towards Mrs. St. Cloud. The dog looked hard&#xD;
at her.&#xD;
VLiilghan, seeing Mrs. Corbin rally so brusquely up to their&#xD;
partnership stock, felt bound by all the rules of knighthood&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT~                133&#xD;
to break a lance in its defence, and turning to Mrs. St. Cloud,&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"My dear madam, there is a point beyond which forbe~r~&#xD;
ance ceases to be a virtue. You are certainly overstepping&#xD;
the bounds accorded by honorable men to your sex."&#xD;
The Newfoundland growled, and looked fiercely at Vaughan;&#xD;
and Ccl. Clarkson, facing him sternly, said:&#xD;
"Do you know who you are speaking to? Mrs. St. Cloud&#xD;
is my friend, sir, and cannot be insulted by a gentleman in&#xD;
my presence; Take back what you have said, young man I"&#xD;
The company were again electrified. Vaughan was no&#xD;
coward, and when not off his guard, knew what was due to a&#xD;
lady, and readily apologized:&#xD;
"I am sorry, madam, if T said any thing under the im.~&#xD;
pulse of the moment which may seem rude; it was not my&#xD;
intention, and Ii ask pardon."&#xD;
The frankness of Vaughan raised him in the estimation&#xD;
of Cob Clarkson and Mrs. St. Cloud, but sank him in pro-&#xD;
portion with Mrs. Corbin and her party, When order was&#xD;
suffidiently restored for Mrs. St. Cloud t~ go on, she said:&#xD;
"I was saying, when interrupted, that you are either the&#xD;
person wl~o stole my property, or you are not. If you are,&#xD;
there is a sear on your right temple, just under your hair."&#xD;
"Did you ever 1" exclaimed Mrs. Corbin. "Suppose you&#xD;
have him stripped to the skin and his person examined. Per-&#xD;
haps you can mention some other private marks about him.&#xD;
Try if you can't."&#xD;
Clara screamed, and as Vaughan was standing near enough&#xD;
to catch her, tainted in his arms, and was borne to the sofa.&#xD;
But the crowd was too great, and the dramatic scene then&#xD;
act~~ too interesting, for a tainting to create a sensation. .No&#xD;
one but Frank seemed to notice her- save the Newfoundland:&#xD;
he walked up, putting his nose close to her dress, looked&#xD;

wistfully in her face a moment, and then took his place at&#xD;
the feet of his mistress.&#xD;
).~uring the whole scene, Mrs. ~t. Cloud had kept her seat,&#xD;
her maid standingg at th~ backof her chair, the others stand-&#xD;
ing around in different parts of the room.&#xD;
Clara had sense enough to see that her part had not&#xD;
been acted well; but she and Frank had a little comedy&#xD;
off in a corner, at thd sofa, by themselves. lie took ad-&#xD;
vantage of her supposed insensibility to press his lips to&#xD;
her hand, and she had sensation enough left to return the&#xD;
pressure, and thank him for his sympathy.&#xD;
"It is ver' strange," said the Duke; "me got une leetle&#xD;
scar dar ;" raising his hair and .exposing it. "Me like to see&#xD;
dat second self to me. Me like you fine him, so me see him."&#xD;
Mrs. St. Cloud was the only person who doubted the Duke's&#xD;
identity. It was impossible, they argued, that a guilty man&#xD;
could affect the innocence hc had displayed throughout the&#xD;
trying scene; and as she did not wish to prolong the inter-&#xD;
view, by way of closing the conversation, she turned to the&#xD;
Duke, saying:&#xD;
"I desire very much to get my property, not for its in-&#xD;
trinsic value, but for the associations connected with it, and&#xD;
will pay twice its value to recover it, and I will add-."&#xD;
"No, no, no; me will adt, me will adt twice dat sum for&#xD;
de watch and de ring."&#xD;
"I was going to add," said Mrs. St. Cloud, paying no other&#xD;
notice to the interruption than to wait until it ceased, and&#xD;
speaking in a quiet uniform tone, "that there is but one Don&#xD;
John de Castro, and you must either produce the counterfeit&#xD;
Don John, or my property, or else go to jail."&#xD;
The excitement upon hearing this was almost too great to&#xD;
bear. Mrs. Corbin raved, Clara fainted again with better&#xD;
success, and' the Newfoundland got up and stood close to his&#xD;

mistress, and whined in her face, and her friends gathered&#xD;
about her ~ind expostulated. They tried to persuade her that&#xD;
the Duke had offered to do all lie could.~.that he was even&#xD;
more deserving sympathy than she, as he had been seriously&#xD;
compromised by a designing rascal taking advantage of an&#xD;
accidental resemblance to him to personate him in an act of&#xD;
villainy-that her anxiety to ~regain a much~treasured relic&#xD;
had betrayed her into wounding the fine sensibilities of a man&#xD;
who was too much of a gentleman to retort. All to no pur-&#xD;
pose: she adhered to her resolution.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
O for a forty parson power&#xD;
To chant thy praise, Hypocrisy.&#xD;
]3YUoN.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE matter furnished a fine dish of gossip, and Mrs. St.&#xD;
Cloud got the worst end of the bargain. Every one present&#xD;
felt a deep interest in the Duke; they had all in one way or&#xD;
another taken stock in him, and could not consent that it&#xD;
should depreciate. They were anxious that the Duke should&#xD;
be a Duke, and he acted so much like a Duke in his eonver~&#xD;
station with Mrs. St. Cloud, that they were better satisfied&#xD;
with him than ever.&#xD;
That night, after the hotel was all still, and a majority of&#xD;
the visitors asleep, the whole house was aroused by a tremen-&#xD;
dous running and noise i~i the hail along the gentlemen's&#xD;
apartment. Each boarder jumped up, and, poking his head&#xD;
out of his door, saw the Newfoundland with the Duke's car-&#xD;
pet-sack and breeches, streaking it for his mistress's room in&#xD;
the apartment occupied by the ladies, hotly pursued by the&#xD;
Duke in his silk-shirt and dVawers. As one and another&#xD;
would put his head out and see the race, they would roar&#xD;
out, "Ha, ha, ha! go it, Duke! go it, Ponto I" And here&#xD;
* went Ponto, and here went the Dpke. It was nip and tack,&#xD;
but the Duke gained on him. Ponto was too heavily weighed&#xD;
* to run well. The crowd followed after; Poiito turned into&#xD;
' the ladies' department, and the ladies looked out to see the&#xD;
- cause of the noise; but the Duke, desperately determined&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.                13~&#xD;
upon reclaiming his goods, was not embarrassed by his nude&#xD;
state, but *dashed ahead; Ponte could not get down stairs&#xD;
well; he would embarrass himself by treading on the breeches,&#xD;
and the Duke kept gaining on him, and the shouts, "Ha, ha,&#xD;
ha! go it, Ponto! go it, Duke !" grew louder and faster, and&#xD;
the crowd larger. At last, just as the dog entered the last&#xD;
.4reteh, the hall upon which his, mistress's room was situated,&#xD;
the Duke so fir gained upon him as to plant his foot upon&#xD;
his breeches. This brought the race to a stop. The New-&#xD;
foundland was determined not to lose his dry-goods, and plant-&#xD;
ing his foot upon them, turned square upon his pursuer with&#xD;
a resolution which checked the Duke's impetuosity, but only&#xD;
for a moment; he was determined to "do or die," and seized&#xD;
his pants, but as he did so, the dog seized him, and, what was&#xD;
worse, he would not let any one else approach, until Mrs. St.&#xD;
Cloud's maid came put, to whom he delivered ~he things. As&#xD;
the maid picked th 1m up, and the Duke stepped forward to&#xD;
demand then~, the og stepped before him and growled. The&#xD;
singular behavior of the animal satisfied every one that there&#xD;
must be some cause for his conduct, and they determined to&#xD;
have an examination. The Duke begged of them not to ex~&#xD;
pose his wardrobe in that way, but to give them to Colonel&#xD;
Olarkson, and let him examine them; that there was nothing&#xD;
which he was unwilling for him or any one else to see, but&#xD;
begged that he~hould not be made the sport of a mob~ raised&#xD;
in behalf of a dog. It was agreed that Colonel Clarkson&#xD;
should go with the rac erg, the Duke and Ponto, to the Duke's&#xD;
room, and examine the Duke's wardrobe, and either satisfy&#xD;
Ponto of his mistake , or reward him for his fidelity. Clark-&#xD;
son remained but a short time in the room, when he and&#xD;
Ponto came out. Ponto was satisfied-..decidedly in a good&#xD;
humor-land trotted along before Mr. Clarkson a few steps,&#xD;
and then would turn around, look up and bark, and wag his&#xD;
bushy tail, and so. on, repeating his motions until Clarkson&#xD;

&#xD;
got to his own room. ~Ponto seemed disappointed at his em.&#xD;
tearing there, but went with him. He soon came out with&#xD;
something in his mouth, very much like a note, and went&#xD;
with, long jumps, his shaggy tail swaying behind hi~,to his&#xD;
mistress's, room. At his scratch, the door was opened, and&#xD;
an exclamation, very much like one of pleasure, was heard.&#xD;
With this, the curious had to be content the balance of the&#xD;
night.&#xD;
To all the questions asked him in the morning, Colonel&#xD;
Clarkson laughed at the ludicrous scene, and gave evasive am.&#xD;
swers, as if all was a farce, and nothing noteworthy in it.&#xD;
Frank Vaughan feeling the great depreciation of the cap-&#xD;
ital stock of the firm, called early upon the ensuing morning&#xD;
to see the other two members. The protestations of the older&#xD;
member, and her tirade against Mrs. St. Cloud, failed to in-&#xD;
spire confidence; but the smiles of Clara assured him that&#xD;
though the capital stock might be a dead loss, the firm was&#xD;
not entirely bankrupt. He noticed that she was by no means&#xD;
oblivious to the sofa scene of the evening previous, and by a&#xD;
number of telegraphic communications, known only to those&#xD;
who are learned in the mysteries of love, she made him un-&#xD;
derstand that she recognized the assault he had made upon&#xD;
the castle, and that the keys were in his hands. As flatter-&#xD;
ing as this was to his vanity, it was going ahead a little too&#xD;
fast for Vaughan. His opinion of Miss Clara had been tried&#xD;
in the loss of~ the Puke's, and the Duke's good opinion being&#xD;
below par just then, other things which were dependent upon&#xD;
his opinion were also under par. He was therefore not ex-&#xD;
actly prepared to accept the surrender, and not altogether&#xD;
satisfied with this new position affairs were taking.&#xD;
As the desire for a matrimonial union with the Puke&#xD;
cooled with Mrs. Corbin, and Vaughan's chances of repre-&#xD;
senting the Republic of Mexico at the Court of St. James&#xD;
began to vanish, the firm' of Vaughan &amp;amp; Co. suffered the&#xD;

&#xD;
drafts of the Duke upon them to be dishonored; who, find-&#xD;
ing himsAf out of character and out of funds, stole Frank's&#xD;
watch and a small amount of money, and left for New&#xD;
Orleans, leaving his board and other bills unpaid, and the&#xD;
following letter, addressed to the finn of Vaughan &amp;amp; Co.;&#xD;
MESSRS. VAUGHAN &amp;amp; Co. :-The best of friends must&#xD;
part; and Ii take advantage of the sad occasion of our sepa-&#xD;
ration, perhaps for ever, to renew to you the expression of&#xD;
my thanks and gratitude for the many favors received from&#xD;
you, as individuals, and as a firm. The junior and Frank&#xD;
Vaughan, Esq., have been especially kind; and it may seem&#xD;
a refinement upon meanness for me to steal Vaughan's watch&#xD;
and money; but the fact is, after my foot-race with Ponto,&#xD;
I have been without a watch or the means to buy one, and&#xD;
had not means left, after your firm had been compelled to&#xD;
suspend further operations on my account, to defray my&#xD;
travelling expenses, else I should have parted company with&#xD;
you sooner. ii hope he will not be inconvenienced by the&#xD;
loss. The junior must allow me to continue to wear her&#xD;
diamond i~i ng ns a souvenir. I would be pleased to exchange&#xD;
rings with her, but for my "temporary poverty." Though&#xD;
Ii may not be able to redeem my pledge to Frank Vaughan,&#xD;
Escp, to have him appointed Minister Resident at the Court&#xD;
of St. James from the Republic of Mexico, if he will visit&#xD;
me at my shop in Vera Cruz, I will dress his hair, and give&#xD;
his chin as clean a shave as I hav~ given his purse and&#xD;
pocket. Please accept the assurances of my continued&#xD;
regard; and if either of you should over visit Vera Cruz,&#xD;
be sure to call upon Your friend,&#xD;
DON JOhN DR CASTRO J)E NAYIDAD,&#xD;

in Bluff City, who feasted and toasted, dined and wined me&#xD;
upon the occasion of my very agreeable visit there. Barring&#xD;
the newness of every thing, the champagne and cigars in-&#xD;
cluded, the dinners were fine. -&#xD;
N. B.-Miss Clara need have no fears of that stain upon&#xD;
her shawl. It is not blood, neither that of a Duke nor of a&#xD;
barber; but a little colored matter that will do no harm.&#xD;
What a denouement for our fashionable~!&#xD;
The watch, the purse, the ring, were not thought of. A&#xD;
barber! Horrible! If he would only reinstate himself in&#xD;
his title, be a Duke again, he might lie and cheat and steal&#xD;
to his full-do any thing he pleased but become a barber&#xD;
That was too much!&#xD;
It was a fall; a fall that made pride and vanity weep with&#xD;
vexation.&#xD;
The members of the late firm of Vaughan &amp;amp; Co. were not&#xD;
long in discovering that the watering-place was not a~ all&#xD;
suited to their constitutions, and that sea-bathing in no way&#xD;
relieved the malady with which they were suffering, and&#xD;
packed up an~l left for honie. Mrs. Corbin and the late&#xD;
junior, upon the dissolution oC the firm of Vaughan &amp;amp; Co.,&#xD;
and the likelihood of its entire bankruptcy, felt still more the&#xD;
necessity of the new partnership between the younger meni-&#xD;
hers of the old dismembered firm, and managed so to take&#xD;
advantage of the distracted state of mind in which their unfor-&#xD;
tunate speculation in imported stock had plunged Frank, to&#xD;
cause him, by manner, and an occasional smile, to treat the&#xD;
"sofa scene" as a plight of faith; at which, in his cool&#xD;
moments, he was alarmed and pained. Events ha&amp;amp; hurried&#xD;
him along so confusedly that in thd bustle he had mistaken&#xD;
a common feeling of humiliation, sympathy, and shame, for&#xD;
a more tender and lasting passion, and permitted the mother&#xD;
and daughter to treat him as afflanced to Clara, without his&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
141&#xD;
&#xD;
having formally declared himself her lover, or any words of&#xD;
b     love         The            an&#xD;
eno~ao'ement or p1edo~e of  spoken.     piercing oi&#xD;
arrow through his heart would not have pained him more&#xD;
than tbis thought. In his infatuation, when he .~aw her&#xD;
caressed and flattered by a Duke, and a ministry to England&#xD;
in prospect for him, and life a long, foolish, but sweet&#xD;
romance, he had the ambition of cutting out a Duke; but&#xD;
when he awoke from this dream of romance, and looked upon&#xD;
the dusty, every-day track of life, which lie had to tread&#xD;
along with every-day folks, the thought of taking a mere&#xD;
butterfly along with him upon such a dull, plodding way,&#xD;
one without perfume and without flowers, made him shudder&#xD;
and grow sick at heart. And yet he saw but little chance&#xD;
of its being otherwise. The mother and daughter were just&#xD;
suffering one distressing humiliation, and lie could not add&#xD;
another to it. Besides, he had so long acquiesced in their&#xD;
recognition of an engagement, that he was not at liberty to&#xD;
treat it otherwise, and determined, to trust to the develop&#xD;
ments of the future for means to shape his course, hoping&#xD;
that some more dashy lover might take her off his hands&#xD;
otherwise, lie should sacrifice his happiness ~o his honor, and&#xD;
marry her.&#xD;
The mock Duke managed, by disguising himself:, to escape&#xD;
to New Orleans. Neither of the members of the late firm&#xD;
took any steps to hayc him arrested. They were but too&#xD;
anxious that lie should escape to his barber-shop, where they&#xD;
might never hear of him again, and their nannies become dis-&#xD;
connected froni his, an all memory of their trau~actions on&#xD;
his account forgotten, and feared nothing more than his&#xD;
arrest. But the affar as too notorious to escape remark,&#xD;
and the vigilant police f New Orlehns, eager to overtake so&#xD;
notorious a rascal and ii poster, and also to serye the distin-&#xD;
buished personages w o had been made his dupes, soon got&#xD;
upon his track, and as he was about going aboard of a ship&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8172-00000072"/>&#xD;
142     PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
bound for Vera Cruz, he was arrested. Very soon thereafter&#xD;
each of the members of the late firm of Vaughan &amp;amp; Co. were&#xD;
chagrined and distressed beyond measure to be served, while&#xD;
upon a visit in the Magnolia State, with an attachment to&#xD;
appear and give evidence in the case of the State of Louis-&#xD;
iana vs. Carlos, alias Don John de Castro de Niwidad.&#xD;
There was no help for it; they were compelled to go. and&#xD;
testify. It was rather a novel case, and the curiosity of the&#xD;
judge was as much piqued as that of the bystanders, and he&#xD;
extended the largest latitude to counsel in the examination&#xD;
of witnesses, and the three ~speculators were forced by little&#xD;
and little to go over and ove~~ again the entire history of their&#xD;
business transactions with ti~ e Duke, down to the most tedi-&#xD;
ous and mortifying deyls. ~To make matters worse, a young&#xD;
fluent lawyer, who had be 4ome rather pleased with Miss&#xD;
Clara, and was ambitious attract her and her mother's&#xD;
favorable regard, and believing the best way to do that was&#xD;
to ~ to punishment the villain who had&#xD;
prosecute and brino'&#xD;
plundered and swindled thdm, volunteered to make a speech&#xD;
in the case. There was such a jam in the court-house that&#xD;
Mrs. Corbin saw no chance of wedging herself through it,&#xD;
and was compelled to listen while the eloquent young bar-&#xD;
rister portray-ed with emphasis and in swelling, poetic sen-&#xD;
tences the outrage and wrong practiced by the prisoner upon&#xD;
the "fair daughter of a sister State." The stealing the&#xD;
watclv was nothing, the stealing th0 money was nothing? fijr&#xD;
"he that steals my purse, steals trash; 'twas mine, 'tis his,&#xD;
and has been slave to thousands; but he that steals away the&#xD;
young affections of a but too eonfidhmg fair one, steaJs that&#xD;
which cannot enrich the thief but leaves her 'poor indeed."'&#xD;
Thinking that he must of course rise in the affections of the&#xD;
mother and daughter as he rose in his eloquence, he de-&#xD;
nounced the Duke as the serpent insinuating himself into&#xD;
Eden, quoting largely from Milton and other English classics;&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.'              143&#xD;
told how the modern Eve listened to his persuasive voice,&#xD;
the influence of his imposing title upon the mother, anxious,&#xD;
as all mothers were and ought to be, to secure eligible.&#xD;
matches for their daughters, especially the first-born of her&#xD;
love, etc., until Mrs. Corbin could stand it no longer; and&#xD;
though a member of the Church, and an habitual observer&#xD;
of the proprieties of life, she lost her patience, piety, and&#xD;
dignity, and springing up, exclaimed, loud enough to be&#xD;
heard by all but the speaker,&#xD;
"What does the confounded fool mean ?"&#xD;
He noticed that he created a sensation, and construing it&#xD;
into applause, mended his hold, and dashed off into new&#xD;
heroic~. Mrs. Corbin made a vigorous effort to push a way&#xD;
for herself and daughter, aided by Frank Vaughan, through&#xD;
the human wall around her, but it was in vain, and she had&#xD;
no alternative left, and had to hear the young Qrator through.&#xD;
The barber was convicted, and sentenced to seven years'&#xD;
imprisonment.&#xD;
The eloquence of the young barrister had a, very different&#xD;
effect upon Clara from that of the mother. , His frequent&#xD;
allusions to her beauty, innocence, and trusting simplicity,&#xD;
"Charms," he said, "that might very well attract a duke,&#xD;
that might even tempt a barber to counterfeit a duke, and if&#xD;
he had acted thus under such a temptation, he might have&#xD;
excused him, for such a face would tempt a saint to sin," etc.,&#xD;
had flattered her vanity and carried her fancy captive; and&#xD;
the sn~ile she gave him when he offered his arm to lead her&#xD;
from the court-room was full compensation for the crustiness&#xD;
of the mother.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
"Come, and trip it as you go,&#xD;
On the light, fantastic toe."&#xD;
SOON after Mrs. Corbin's return from th~e ill-starred witness-&#xD;
stand, a grand ball was announced to be given by the military&#xD;
~company, whose marching and counter-marching, "red-striped&#xD;
trousers" and red plumes had long been the admiration of&#xD;
the fair of Bluff City. All the beauty and chivalry of the&#xD;
town and surrounding country were expected to be there in&#xD;
full display. Amid the hurry and bustle of such an occa-&#xD;
sion, the rustling of fine dresses, the cracking of coach-&#xD;
whips, and the tramp along the side - walks, friend Piper&#xD;
might have been seen, whip in hand, pushing~ along in the&#xD;
crowd. As he was dashing ahead, a young gentleman called&#xD;
to him, and handing him a neat little package, said:&#xD;
"I will trouble you, if you please, to hand these to your&#xD;
daughters."&#xD;
Piper was excited-gave a sort of knowing look of inquiry&#xD;
at the young many but received no knowing look in return.&#xD;
The young man was not a dealer in horse-flesh, and had no&#xD;
horse-trader looks to answer horse-trading questions. Piper's&#xD;
impatience would not permit him to wait until he got home&#xD;
to learn what the neat little package was; and hoping, doubt-&#xD;
ing, fearing, he darted along to a place of concealment and&#xD;
opened it. Yes, it was as he hoped-" the girls" were invited&#xD;
to the ball! He had talked about the matter with Betsy,&#xD;
and both hoped "the girls" would be invited, but both&#xD;
&#xD;
feared they might not. His fears were all gone, and with a&#xD;
light heart. he put the notes of invitation in his pocket, and&#xD;
with light heels Gilpin galloped home. So glibly did he&#xD;
gallop that passers-by exclaimed, "Hi! Piper must be in&#xD;
luck to-day; he and Gilpin are in good spirits."&#xD;
Betsy and "the girls" noticed directly that things had.&#xD;
gone well with him. They collected around to hear the&#xD;
news. He was fidgety, and frisked about in a provokingly&#xD;
unsatisfactory way. Pet walked coaxingly up to him, and,&#xD;
putting his arm around her, he walked about the room in&#xD;
high spirits.&#xD;
"What would you give to go to the ball ?" he asked.&#xD;
"0! have you got tickets ?" exclaimed all at once, and&#xD;
rushed at him; and such a romp and race as they had!&#xD;
"Ha! get away from here, you wild colts !" and he&#xD;
twisted to frde himself. "What will you give for tickets,&#xD;
heh ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
After a good deal of scuffling and twisting' about, and a&#xD;
number of "ho, ho, hos" from Piper, Betsy came to the aid&#xD;
of the girls:&#xD;
"Mr. Piper, what makes you do so? Why don't you give&#xD;
the girls their tickets? I know you've got them."&#xD;
This brought the tickets; and they were read and re-read,&#xD;
and then read over again, and finally carefully folded and put&#xD;
in the card-ease.&#xD;
If those who give feasts could have seen how happy a very&#xD;
little attention had made four very deserving but neglected&#xD;
young ladies, in giving feasts they would not overlook the&#xD;
humble simply because they are humble, but would oftener&#xD;
set a chair for them at their tables. Coarseness and vulgar-&#xD;
ity are by n6 means necessary attendants upon lowliness and&#xD;
poverty; no more apt to be found tl~ere than among the rich&#xD;
and proud.&#xD;
"We can go, can't we, pa ?" they asked.&#xD;

&#xD;
"1 don't know, my daughters. I'll think about it;" not&#xD;
willing to admit to himself how miieh'pleased he was to have&#xD;
it in his power to decide whether they could go or not, and&#xD;
ho~v anxious he was an hour previous to have them go.&#xD;
"Yes, you can go. What do you want to tease the girls&#xD;
nor? You know you expect them to go," said Betsy.&#xD;
j' Say yes, pa," entreated Pet.&#xD;
"Well, yes; ydu may all go."&#xD;
There was as much rummaging among the scanty wardrobes&#xD;
of Piper's four daughters for "something to wear," as among&#xD;
the dry-goods shops for something to please the moic liberal&#xD;
and extravagant votaries of fashion. "Ma, what shall III&#xD;
wear ?" "Pa~, wont you get me a new dress ?" "1 have&#xD;
nothing that is fit to weary" were some of the volley of sen-&#xD;
tences which made Piper almost regret the invitation.&#xD;
Betsy made out a list of the articles that were indispensable&#xD;
for even a passable appearance at a bran-dance or a Fourth&#xD;
of July barbecue, and showed it to Piper, with the request&#xD;
that he would let her have the means to purchase them.&#xD;
Piper looked at it, gave a loud whistle, and refused.&#xD;
"The girls are bound to have something to wear, or they&#xD;
can't go to the ball," said Betsy.&#xD;
"Where are all the dresses they had last spring and sum-&#xD;
mer, and this fall ?"&#xD;
"All that are not worn out are soile , and not fit to&#xD;
wear."&#xD;
"Where are the dresses they wore at our parties ?"&#xD;
"They are worn thin, and have been washed two or three&#xD;
times and cannot be refined so as to look decent."&#xD;
"Well, IL can't help it; I am not going to break myself to&#xD;

they shall' have something nice. Here is seven dollars and&#xD;
a half: take it, and buy their ball-dre~ses. It shan't be my&#xD;
fault if they don't look as well as other people's daughters."&#xD;
&#xD;
I~LAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.               147&#xD;
Betsy took the seven dollars and a half; and went to pur-&#xD;
chase the ball gear of fo~r young ladies. She was not a bad&#xD;
hand to shop, and could make seven dollars and a half go as&#xD;
far as anybody, when she exerted herself; and on this occa-&#xD;
sion she swore each dollar to do its best. She made the&#xD;
clerks jump about, and kept them as busy as if she had&#xD;
* hundreds to spend; calling for this, and rejecting that, and&#xD;
telling what this was for, and who that wa~ for. She was&#xD;
full of real good mother~wit, which she coul make as sharp&#xD;
as old vinegar; and when one of the clerks would grow tired&#xD;
of waiting upon her, and 'go slovenly about her commands,&#xD;
she would let off her cracked voice a~ him, with a piece of&#xD;
wit that made him spring as if stung by a whip-lash. With&#xD;
her seven dollars and a half she loaded herself and the&#xD;
daughter she took with her; and when the articles were all&#xD;
opened and spread out at home, upon the cheaply=furni~he~~&#xD;
bed, and viewed in contrast with the litter and trash about&#xD;
the room, it was astonishing how well it all looked, and how&#xD;
much there was of it. She had managed to get enough for&#xD;
three new dresses, and remnants enough to fix up an old one.&#xD;
Upon the evening of the party, an old bachelor brother of~&#xD;
Mrs. Pipei', Richard Spence-called "Uncle Dick," by "the&#xD;
girls," and "the girls' Uncle Dick," by Betsy and Piper-&#xD;
went out to attend them to the ball. He was a plain, blunt,&#xD;
good-natured old soul, and had s~en a good deal of 'what was&#xD;
called "good society;" that is, was generally invited to the&#xD;
parties about town, and was a welcome visitor at the houses&#xD;
of the rich and fashionable. Why he should have been thus&#xD;
welcome, would be di~cult to teU, unless it was owing to his&#xD;
good temper an~ good principles and blunt ways; for he was'&#xD;
neither rich nor handsome. The fashionable planing-mill&#xD;
had failed to smooth him off; except on top of the head,&#xD;
which was very bald and very smooth, lie was fond of&#xD;
"the girls," and was anxious to see them look well 'and&#xD;

appear well;' and, as Piper had informed him how busy they&#xD;
all were, fixing and getting ready, and complained over and&#xD;
over again how exp~nsivO it was to fit out four young ladies&#xD;
for a ball, he expected when they caine down ready dressed&#xD;
to seq them elegantly attired, and gave rather too round an&#xD;
expression to his disappointment:&#xD;
"Goo~1 Lord, Piper! you are not' going to let the girls go&#xD;
to the ball in that sort of toggery ?"&#xD;
"Why, what is the matter with it? I never saw them&#xD;
look any better; I never saw them look as well before. I&#xD;
gave Betsy seven dollars and a half, and told her to use the&#xD;
whole of it in buying dresses and such other things a~ they&#xD;
needed."&#xD;
"Seven dollars and a half! A hundred would not have&#xD;
been enough."&#xD;
"The free use of your hundreds is the reason you are not&#xD;
worth more. If you had taken better care of your hundreds,&#xD;
you might be rich."&#xD;
"Fiddlesticks! I wish I'd knoWn they had nothing better&#xD;
to wear; II would have bought th~tm something myself I'll&#xD;
be smashed if I go one step toward the balJ."&#xD;
"The girls" gathered around a~ d entreated him:&#xD;
"0 Uncle Dick, don't say that! It is too late to better&#xD;
it now, and our dresses will do well enough."&#xD;
His anger was not of long duration, and he was provoked&#xD;
at himself for marring the anticipated pleasure of the young&#xD;
ladies by his ill-timed remark, and tried to destroy its damp-&#xD;
ening effect as well as he could.&#xD;
They were anxious to hurry to the ball as early as possible,&#xD;
and were deaf to "Uncle Dick's" assurances that it was much&#xD;
too early--that the 6lite would not be there for two hour~ or&#xD;
more, and refused to listen to his advice to "wait for the&#xD;
mttsic," and arrived among the first. It was some time before&#xD;
the more successful ~votaries of fashion arrived, and "the&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAY I~G   FOR AMUSEMENT.              149&#xD;
girls" had a joyous time of it; but as the room' began to fill&#xD;
with the b~au~nionde, they began to recollect Uncle Dick's&#xD;
exch~mation about their "toggery,?' and a keen sense of the&#xD;
disagreeable contrast cut short their fun; but or4y for a&#xD;
short tim e. They had not been to balls enough to know~ that&#xD;
each one is employedd about him or herself too much to notice&#xD;
others, unless it be in something very superior. And they&#xD;
were relieved to find that they were not objects of attention-.&#xD;
a circumstance that grieved Piper not a little. He thought&#xD;
his "girls" were certain to create a sensation; that all they&#xD;
needed was an opportunity, in order to make a stir in the&#xD;
fashionable world, especially 'Pet. He expected the morning&#xD;
after their introduction into society-and this was the intro-&#xD;
duction-he would be troubled by any amount of offers from&#xD;
marrying young men for their hands, and had conned over&#xD;
in his mind what ho should say in reply: 'how he should play&#xD;
coy; the fond father; what a happy, love.~boi~nd circle at&#xD;
home; how reluctant to have it broken; how tenderly they&#xD;
had been raised; never known harshness or sorrow; never&#xD;
thought what it was to yield up his child to another; but&#xD;
0&#xD;
&amp;amp;ivls must marry; the world must be peopled; and, sad as it&#xD;
was, fathers had to give up their children; and, as it was a&#xD;
thing that had to be done, though it was like sapping the&#xD;
springs of life, he knew of no one to whom lie would sooner&#xD;
intrust their happiness, etc. rut, as it was, the evening was&#xD;
passing away, and they were passing without notice, and he&#xD;
deterniined to exert himself; and doing so, soon had their&#xD;
dancing cards filled. Nothing occurred to mortify them;&#xD;
and, if they had not satisfied Piper's ambition, they wei'e&#xD;
satisfied with themselves; and after forgetting their plain&#xD;
attire, which was soon lost in the novelty and fascination of&#xD;
every thing which surrounded them, they were as happy as&#xD;
young and innocent hearts could be; and Uncle Dick, observ-&#xD;
ing their bright faces, and wishing to atone for the damper&#xD;

he had so uiifeelingly thrown upon them in the early part of&#xD;
the evening, was very attentive.&#xD;
The ball-room was extensive and brilliantly lightod-not&#xD;
by gas, for at that period the city had no gas-and the as-&#xD;
sembly of beauty unusually large, even for Bluff City, so&#xD;
renowned for her handsome daughters. There were belles&#xD;
of all kinds and shades-tall and low ones; fair ones and&#xD;
brown; rich ones and poor ones; witty ones and grave. In&#xD;
a pause in the music, as the sets were forming, a slight stir&#xD;
was noticed near the door, and gradually increased until it&#xD;
became general throughout the saloon. It was occasioned by&#xD;
the entrance of Mrs. St. Cloud and her daughter. As they&#xD;
moved down the ro.on~ in search of a seat, or place to stand,&#xD;
a universal whisper greeted them-" What a beautiful crea-&#xD;
ture !" "What a lovely face I" "Who is she ?" "how&#xD;
fair !" "What a face I" "What eyes !"--from belles and&#xD;
beaux. She was soon the centre of general attraction--the&#xD;
belles to know and to welcome her, and the beaux to secure&#xD;
her hand in the dance. The other belles soon found them-&#xD;
selves objects of secondary interest; but such was the homage&#xD;
paid to the exquisitely fair and unconsciously beautiful Alice,&#xD;
that no feeling of rivalry or jealousy was awakened. Even&#xD;
Miss Clara, in the face of her mother's savage commentary,&#xD;
yielded her the palm. The homage paid was as sincere as it&#xD;
was involuntary, and received without a sensation or expres-&#xD;
sion df vanity. Neither by look, nor word, nor action, did&#xD;
she give evidence of the slightest consciousness of being the&#xD;
shrine at which the beauty, chivalry, and talent of her child-&#xD;
hood's home kneeled and gave the heart's earnest, truthful&#xD;
offering. She was only conscious of being very happy, and&#xD;
of everybody being very l4nd. This was the real secret of&#xD;
her power; it was what extracted the tooth of envy and&#xD;
silenced the tongue of the fault-finder. Her beauty was&#xD;
.beyond the power of words, because it was not in the features;&#xD;
&#xD;
a sculptor might chisel them, or they might be copied in&#xD;
wax-work, or an artist might paint them, but neither would&#xD;
be Alice St. Cloud. As well might one try to describe a&#xD;
sweet strain of music that thrilled the soul and carried the&#xD;
will captive, as to describe in what her beauty insistedd. it&#xD;
was not ethereal, and y~t it did not seem to hav~e the impress&#xD;
of mortality; it was not like fruit blushing on the limb, and&#xD;
yet it had all its lusciousness; it was not like the lily droop-&#xD;
ing on the stein, and ye~ it was, just as fair; her face was&#xD;
white as a snow-flake, with a blush of the rose coming and&#xD;
0&#xD;
going at pleasure, and lit up by a pair of as soft black eyes&#xD;
as ever illumined the "human face divine," and all derived&#xD;
expression from her heavy mass of glossy black hair. While&#xD;
others were bending the knee to her, Frank Vaughan bent&#xD;
his whole soul; her smile, gentle as that which the moon~&#xD;
beam flings on the lake, entranced him, and for the fir~t time&#xD;
in his life he was wounded, and wounded to the death, by&#xD;
Cupid's arrow. lie longed for freedom to lay his hand, his&#xD;
heart, his all, at her feet, but honor forbade. He had allowed&#xD;
another to consider him a~ her affianced, and was too honorable&#xD;
to humiliate her before the public by declaring the truth and&#xD;
breaking with her. He preferred to suffer himself rather&#xD;
than to make her suffer. The image of Alice was as deeply&#xD;
engraved upon his heart as Galais was said to be upon the&#xD;
heart of "bloody Mary ;" and he had the satisfaction during&#xD;
the evening of noticing that she~ was not insensible to his&#xD;
silent admiration.&#xD;
Ther~ is a sympathy between hearts made for each other&#xD;
that cannot well be explained, and the scent of their mutual&#xD;
regard, like murder, "will out." Thoiio~h neither Vaughan&#xD;
nor Alice had said a#iy thing or did an~7 thing that betokened&#xD;
lpve or regard for each other, they both left the ball-room&#xD;
that night with the self-satisfied assurance that neither was&#xD;
an object of indifference to the other. It was strange to&#xD;

Alice how she should, without having made Vaughan a&#xD;
subject of conversation that she was aware of, become pos-&#xD;
sessed during the evening of a full knowledge of his history,&#xD;
and the relation he sustained to Miss Clara Corbin. In her&#xD;
simple, honest heart she congratulated Clara upon her choice,&#xD;
and none who knew the quick beating of her pulse at the&#xD;
mention of his name will blame her if she turned a shade&#xD;
whiter, if possible, at the thought of his choice.&#xD;
Among the many who had gathered there to "chase the&#xD;
hours with flying feet," none entered more fully into the&#xD;
spirit of the occasion, or abandoned herself more entirely to&#xD;
the exhilaration of the music, than Mrs. Smith, the accom-&#xD;
plished and engaging wife of our jolly friend, the lawyer.&#xD;
She was fond of the society of young people, and they were&#xD;
equally fond of hers. She had been married about six years,&#xD;
and had three interesting and healthy children; was idola-&#xD;
trously attached to her husband, though their tastes seemed&#xD;
to be altogether different, or ratl~er they were the same, but&#xD;
sought different modes of expressing and gratifying them.&#xD;
They were both fond of pleasure, but he found his at the&#xD;
table and cards, while she found hers in the dissipation of&#xD;
the young and gay. She was not exactly gay, but cheerful&#xD;
and light-hearted, and had never had a greater weight "on&#xD;
the heart than she could shake off at the heels," as she had&#xD;
often boasted~ She was in unusually high spirits on the even-.&#xD;
ing of the party, and while whirling away in the dance with&#xD;
heart light and spirits gay, she all at once started and uttered&#xD;
a low wail. Her friends gathered around and eagerly inquired:&#xD;
"My dear Mrs. Smitl~! what is the matter ?"&#xD;
"0 my I" she sighed, and breathed freer.&#xD;
"What can be the matter? Are you sick? Let mc send&#xD;
for a doctor?"&#xD;
"0 no! It is nothing, nothing at all," she laughingly&#xD;
answered.&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;

"Something must be the matter. What makes you act so?"&#xD;
"I had forgotten the dance, and my imagination or fancy&#xD;
was running riot to keep up with the waltz, I suppose, when&#xD;
I was startled by a most frightful picture. I thought i[ saw&#xD;
some one lying on a bier all covered with blood, and it looked&#xD;
like Mr. Smith."&#xD;
"Mrs. Smith !" exclaimed a dozen at once.&#xD;
"Pshaw! it is nothing. Silva," (her waiting-maid,) "go&#xD;
and see where your master is."&#xD;
The girl soon returned, informing her that he was with&#xD;
Col. CThxkson and some friends, near by, and seemed to b&amp;amp;&#xD;
enjoying himself as much a~ his wife. Mrs. Smith put in&#xD;
practice her proverb, and went to work to shake from her&#xD;
heels the load on her heart, and very soon succeeded.&#xD;
Mrs. Smith had to send a servant in search of her husband&#xD;
because she felt assured that, when found, he would be where&#xD;
ladies were not expected to go. It may seem strange to some,&#xD;
that husbands, and fathers, and brothers should frequent a&#xD;
place so disreputable as that their wives, daughters, or sisters&#xD;
would be disgraced to be seen at it. But so it was. A la~l~&#xD;
removed from the ball-room, up stairs over a ~'espectctblc&#xD;
drinking-house, the servant found a number of the husbands&#xD;
and fathers and brothers, whose wives and daughters and&#xD;
sisters were left to the entertainment of others, seated at&#xD;
little round tables, with money, and cards, and brandy before&#xD;
them, playing fur amusement and betting to count the game;&#xD;
and the i~egro was astonished how much money it took to&#xD;
count with ;~ and was equally astonished to hear disputes all&#xD;
around the room about cheating, unfair count, etc.; and&#xD;
gentlemen whose word she thought would have been taken for&#xD;
thousands~ disputing with each other about a dQllar. But so&#xD;
it was: a gentleman whose word, in all the legitimate trans-&#xD;
actions of life, was worth any amount that might be staked&#xD;
on it, found it questioned by his most trusty friend, for the&#xD;

'paltry sum of a dollar. Nothing seems to develop the baser&#xD;
feelings of man's nature more than cards. Let the game be&#xD;
for what it may, and the players as trustworthyas they may,&#xD;
disputes about niatters the most trifling will arise, and often&#xD;
become serious.&#xD;
Sniith sat at a table with Col. Clarkson, Floyd, Blunt,&#xD;
Isaacs, Orr, and a young friend and prot6g6 of Isaacs, called&#xD;
"Bud," a diminutive little fellow, and of whom Isaacs was&#xD;
very fond, and from whom he would bear almost any thing.&#xD;
A large amount of brandy had been drunk as well as money&#xD;
lost, and "Bud" would have been called drunk, if a prot6g6&#xD;
of Isaacs could have been called so with impunity. Isaacs&#xD;
himself had drunk but little; Smith had drunk more than&#xD;
common, and was as mellow as a ripe apple, and as good-&#xD;
humored as brandy could make him. ~'Bud" was drunk&#xD;
enough to be quarrelsome, and accused one and another about&#xD;
the board of cheating, but directed his accusations mainly at&#xD;
Isaacs.&#xD;
"Colonel, you cheated."&#xD;
"You are mistaken, Bud." His voice trembled a little,&#xD;
and hi~ face colored.&#xD;
"No, by -~-, I am not mistakefi. You did cheat."&#xD;
" You are mistaken."&#xD;
"You did n't deal the cards fair. You shall deal them&#xD;
over again," and dashes up his hand.&#xD;
"You are drunk, Bud; and too small physically for inc to&#xD;
resent what you say.~~&#xD;
"Deal the cards, and don't be talking."&#xD;
Isaacs trembled with rage, and was almost blind with pas-&#xD;
sion, and in dealing made a mistake, and failed to give Bud&#xD;
his full complement of cards, at which Bud again accused him&#xD;
of cheating.&#xD;
"You are mistaken, Bud. You are too infernally drunk to&#xD;
know when you l~ave your full complement of cards."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"Bud is right this time," said Smith, counting over Bud's&#xD;
cards, and meaning simply that he was right in not having&#xD;
received his full complement. Col. Tsaacs regarded it as an&#xD;
endorsement of Bud's charge of cheating, and springing up,&#xD;
his hair bristling abouL his head, roared out like an enraged&#xD;
lion&#xD;
"By -; that is just what T wanted to hear! I have not&#xD;
resented the repeated insults of that boy because he was a&#xD;
boy, but you are a man."&#xD;
And before Smith had~time to explain, Isaacs smote him&#xD;
with his open hand upon his right cheek, and then upon the&#xD;
left with the other hand; and telling him where he could*&#xD;
find him, if he desired to wipe out the insult, turned and left&#xD;
the room.&#xD;
The insult was public, and, according to the Southern&#xD;
sense of honor, too gross to be atoned for by an apology; and&#xD;
if it were not, Tsaacs wa~ not the man to make one, without&#xD;
some explanation from Smith, which, according to the&#xD;
"Code," he could not make, smarting, as he was, 'under next&#xD;
to the greatest insult one gentlen~an could offer to another.&#xD;
No alternative was therefore left to Smith but a peremptory call&#xD;
upon Jsaacs for satisfaction; and Col. Clarkson was asked to&#xD;
bear from him a hostile message to Jsaacs. It was a new&#xD;
game for Col. Clarkson to play, and the stake was the life of&#xD;
two of his friends. He lunch preferred not to take a hand&#xD;
in such a game. He could play for amusement, and bet to&#xD;
count the game, but he desired to bet money; but in the game&#xD;
he was expected to take a hand in, human life was the stake,&#xD;
and honor the forfeit! What would Amy, the wife of his bosom,&#xD;
say, with her pleading face turned up to his? What woi4d&#xD;
his angel daughter say, when she heard it? And, above all,&#xD;
what would the agonized wife say?, He would have turned&#xD;
away,: but the hand was dealt out to him, and he must play&#xD;
it, or be false to his friend. He waited upon Isaacs with the&#xD;

note, and was referred to Captain Orr, as Js~acs' friend. As&#xD;
delay in such matters expressed timidity or a desire to obtain&#xD;
some trifling advantage in the weapon, by practice or some&#xD;
other way, it was determined that the parties were to fight&#xD;
on the Louisiana side, opposite Bluff City, at eight o'clock&#xD;
next morning, with' rifles, at fifty paces. News of the in&#xD;
tended duel soon spread over the town, but was scrupulously&#xD;
kept froi~n M rs~ Smith, the person of all others the most&#xD;
interested.&#xD;
Early in the morning the ferry-boat and skiffs were ~ross-&#xD;
ing the river, carrying over crowds curious to sec men in&#xD;
deadly combat, with niuch the same feeling that whole owns&#xD;
and villages in Spain turn out to see a bull-fight. The prin-&#xD;
cipals, with their seconds, were upon the ground, prom t to&#xD;
the hour.&#xD;
Capt. Orr takes Col. Clarlison to one side; they consult&#xD;
for a moment or two; go to their principals' and lead hem&#xD;
off a few steps, and talk in a suppressed tone; meet and con-&#xD;
sult again; walk about and inspect the ground; walk to one&#xD;
spot, and look at an opposite one; walk to that, and look at&#xD;
the first; examine if trees or undergrowth or other thing&#xD;
standing near will aid either party in catching aim; Clarkson&#xD;
stands at one point, and Orr at the other, and they scan&#xD;
closely the advantages or disadvantages of either position;&#xD;
they change positions, and make the same examination; look&#xD;
at the position of the sun; Ccl. Clarkson takes from his&#xD;
pocket a tape-line; Capt. Orr takes out his knife, and whit-&#xD;
tIes to a point two small pegs, and sticks one in the ground;&#xD;
Col. Clarkson gives Orr one end of the tape-line, and they&#xD;
measure fifty paces; it stops in an inconvenient place; they&#xD;
speak a word or two; ~ few steps are added to the distance,&#xD;
to get a good position to stand, and the other peg is stuck in&#xD;
the ground; they walk off a few paces; Capt. Orr ha~i~ his&#xD;
friend's rifle to Col. Clarkson to examine; Clarkson do~ the&#xD;
&#xD;
same; the guns are returned; a cap is busted on each, to&#xD;
see if the tubes are clear; they toss up a half dollar for the&#xD;
word; Clarkson wins, and Orr has choice of pegs; go to&#xD;
their principals-Col. Isaacs standing by a tree, his nostrils&#xD;
distended, and a look of blood in his eye, Smith seated at the&#xD;
root 6'f a tree, looking quietly and thoughtfully; they talk~&#xD;
in a low' voice to them, and walk with them to the pegs;&#xD;
meet midway; diverge a little from a righ~ line; take out&#xD;
their gun-chargers, and show them to each other; fill them&#xD;
with powder, and show to each other, 4nd turn them in 'the&#xD;
muzzle; take out a bullet; examine, to see that it is round&#xD;
and without flaws; show to eacl~ other, and ram them in the&#xD;
gun, and put on caps; load two other rifles, and put two&#xD;
well-loaded pistols in their belts; walk to their friends, turn,&#xD;
and meet in the centre, and, turning at right angles, step&#xD;
twenty-five paces; Col. Clarkson takes out a paper, and says:&#xD;
"Gentlemen, II will now read you the terms of the duel:&#xD;
Item 1. The parties are to fight at eight o'clock. on the&#xD;
morning of the - day of , A. ID. ~, opposite Bluff&#xD;
City, on the Louisiana side, with rifles stocked in the ordi-&#xD;
nary Kentucky style, and not to be less than thirty-two nor&#xD;
more than thirty-six inches in the barrel, nor to carry a larger&#xD;
ball than forty to th~ pound.&#xD;
"'Item 2. The parties are to stand at a distance of fifty&#xD;
paces from each other; and the guns to be handed to them&#xD;
by their principals, cocked, and triggers sprung, and to be&#xD;
held with the butt to the shoulder used in shooting, the&#xD;
muzzle pointing a distance of not more than twenty inches&#xD;
from the forward foot.&#xD;
"' Item 3. The seconds shall throw up "heads or tails"&#xD;
for the word; and the party losing the word shall have choice&#xD;
of positions.&#xD;

are you ready ?" If ready, each principal shall say, loud&#xD;

enough tp be heard by the seconds, "Ready ;" when the&#xD;
second shall say, in a distinct voice, loud enough to be heard&#xD;
by the principals, "Fire ! one, two, three-stop !" An'd&#xD;
either party shooting before the word " fire," or after the word&#xD;
"stop," or who shall oth~erwisezviolate the rules of duelling&#xD;
in a manner to obtain an advantage of his adversary, shall&#xD;
forfeit his life; and the second of the opposite party shall&#xD;
take it at his option.&#xD;
"' Item 5. After the parties are stationed at the pegs by&#xD;
their seconds, these rules of the duel shall be read over to&#xD;
them by the second winning the word.'"&#xD;
"Will you please call over the word, Col. Clarkson, as you&#xD;
intend giving it to the parties ?" .asked Capt. Orr.&#xD;
" Gentlemen, I will give you the word thus: ' Gentlemen,&#xD;
are you ready ?' You answer, 'Ready.' 'Fire ! one, two,&#xD;
three-stop!I'"&#xD;
Clarkson and Orr take to their respective principals their&#xD;
guns, cock and hand them to them, and return to their places.&#xD;
The multitude standing around breathe hard, and have a&#xD;
fixed stare. Isaacs runs his eye along the line to his adver-&#xD;
sary, fixes itekeenly upon him, compresses his lips, and braces&#xD;
every muscle. Smith is passive.&#xD;
"Gentlemen, are you ready ?" rings out clear and start-&#xD;
ling. Smith looks at Clarkson, and answers, " Ready."&#xD;
Isaacs fixes his eye steadily upon Smith, and answers,&#xD;
"Ready." " Fire !" Bang go both guns, before the word&#xD;
"one."&#xD;
"Smith is hit !" bursts from a hundred lips. Col. Clark-&#xD;
son rushes to him, and arrives just in time to' hear him&#xD;
gurgle forth, a"Tel~ my poor wife and chil----" as he fell&#xD;
back into his arms a dead man. The ball had gone through&#xD;

whelming load of grief she bears to the home of the newly.&#xD;
made and' unconscious widow ! She lands; a hearse is&#xD;
obtained, and six men bear the jolly, harmless Smith of&#xD;
yesterday to it, all stark anmd bloody. The hearse rumbles&#xD;
solemnly along' the street, attended by Col. Clarkson and a&#xD;
fewothr fiens.  heheart of the messenger sent to&#xD;
preareMrs Snithforthe sad intelligence failed him; and&#xD;
there she stands, at the window, and wonders whose funeral&#xD;
procession approaches thus slowly, at which Col. Clarkson is&#xD;
the chief mourner, all unconscious-that the father of her three&#xD;
children is thus being borne home to them and her ! Here&#xD;
was a trial for Col. Clarkson ! And the wail of the overtried&#xD;
heart, as it broke, and the widowed wife sank upon the body&#xD;
of her dead husband a raving maniac, still haunts the pillow&#xD;
of the man who played for amusement, and bet to count t1he&#xD;
game, and lost the life of his friend.&#xD;
The victim of innocent play was buried, and a tombstone&#xD;
with letters cut in it commemorative of some of his virtues&#xD;
was erected over him, to mark the spot where he lay. But&#xD;
no one wrote thereon, as a warning to youth: "Beware of&#xD;
playing for amusement, and betting to count the game !"&#xD;
The children thus untimely orphaned were kindly cared&#xD;
for by Colonel Clarkson; but the wife, with her weight of&#xD;
soi-row, sleeps quiEtly beside her husband ; and the spring&#xD;
bird that builds its nest in the rose-vine that monthly blooms&#xD;
over the perishing clay, as it warbles to its mate and its little&#xD;
ones, sings not of all the grief that lies buried there.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
IT was the purpose of Vaughan to avoid temptation; and&#xD;
as he thought honor and his own~ peace of mind required&#xD;
that he should not extend his acqt~ai~itance with Miss Alice&#xD;
St. Cloud, he resolved not to see her again, and had resisted&#xD;
all the entreaties of his young friends to visit her with them.&#xD;
One afternoon, when thinking of her, and lameiiting the folly&#xD;
which had placed a barrier between him and her, and con-&#xD;
gratulating himself in a sort of irresolute way upon his stoi-&#xD;
cism in resisting the temptation to see her, Nickols walked&#xD;
into his office, with his thumbs in the arm-holes of his vest.&#xD;
"O-ood morning, iNickols. Take a seat."&#xD;
"lla-a-a-awk--no, I thank you ;" and commenced a pro-&#xD;
menade back and fro in the room, hawking as he went.&#xD;
"Come, take a seat, take a seat," insisted Vaughan.&#xD;
"Ha-a-a-awk-no, no; sit still ;" and takes a turn or two&#xD;
more, drops into 'a chair, and cocks his feet up over his head.&#xD;
"Vaughan-ha-a-a-awk-I saw the prettiest piece of hu-&#xD;
man flesh to-day I ever saw, in so much domestic manufac-&#xD;
ture-an angel in dry-goods 1"&#xD;
"AhI Who is she, Nickols ?"'&#xD;
"That's what I come to ask you--that 's what I want to&#xD;
know ;" and jumping up, whirls around,~ with a "Ha, ha,&#xD;
ha ;" and squaring himself before Vaughan, pokes out his two&#xD;
fingers, and grins, "You understand ?"&#xD;
"Well, no, not exactly; describe her."&#xD;
"Describe her! Can you describe light? Can yo~~de-&#xD;
&#xD;
scribe a moonbeam? Can't describe without a comparison,&#xD;
and have nothing to compare her to. You understand?&#xD;
heli! you understand ?"&#xD;
"I do not understand sufficiently to tell you who she, is;&#xD;
and unless you can compose yourself, and give plain answers,&#xD;
I fear you will have to go unsatisfied."&#xD;
"Well, you know Mrs. St. Ckiud has been away for several&#xD;
years, and her house, near my old shanty, has been unten..&#xD;
anted. Lately I have noticed a great clearing up there, and&#xD;
a rapping of hammers, and an unloading of furniture, and&#xD;
all that sort of thing, and this morning as I passed I saw&#xD;
leaning over the balcony-rail an angel in dry-goods. Now,&#xD;
who is she? I come to you, because I know that no new&#xD;
calico or cambric can come to town without your knowing it;."&#xD;
"I presume it is Miss Alice St. Cloud."&#xD;
"What! Mrs. St. Cloud's daughter ?"&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"I used to know her when she was a small girl ,and she&#xD;
was then a beautiful and innocent child, but I never expected&#xD;
to see her grow into such a picture as that."&#xD;
He ha-a-a-awked about the room a time or two, and turn-&#xD;
ing upon Frank, said:&#xD;
"Frank, what makes you look so grave, old hoss ?"&#xD;
"Nothing."&#xD;
"Nothing don't affect men's livers, man; and yours must&#xD;
be out of order, or you would not be so close. Come, if&#xD;
any thing is the matter, out 'with it."&#xD;
"There is nothing th~ matter. I am perfectly well."&#xD;
"Then rally, and talk to me about sweet Alice St. Cloud."&#xD;
"What do you want me to say ?"&#xD;
"Any thing in your dictionary. Are you in love ~with her&#xD;
yourself?"&#xD;
Frank 'started as if something had stung him.&#xD;
"You need not start so; I won't tell anybody, and will not&#xD;

try to cut you out. You marry the girl, and I '11 marry the&#xD;
mother; be your daddy-in-law-ha, ha, ha! Don't be down,&#xD;
Frank; I give her up at once; I am used to it. I have been&#xD;
waiting at the pooi for the ~~oubling of the waters, Jo these&#xD;
forty years, and whenever an angel like Miss Alice comes&#xD;
down and troubles the water, some fellow like you steps in&#xD;
bef'orp me. Suppose we call and see her this evening; you&#xD;
the daughter, and I the mother-you understand? What&#xD;
say you ?"&#xD;
"I'll go."&#xD;
"Good. I '11 call round for you at seven-ha-a-a-awk,"&#xD;
and left.&#xD;
Vaughan felt ashamed that lie should thus have committed&#xD;
himself to see her, and voluntarily place his heart in harm's&#xD;
way. He had felt some sense of cheapness when returning&#xD;
froni his evening walks, to reflect that they had always led&#xD;
by Mrs. St. Cloud's residence, and his truant eyes would&#xD;
wander about the windows, hoping to encounter a pair of&#xD;
black ones looking out for him; but here he had consented&#xD;
to spend the evening in her company The effect of such a&#xD;
visit he felt would but be a new attack of the heartache, and&#xD;
a multiplying his unavailing regrets, and hence determined&#xD;
that he would break his promise to Nickols, and went to&#xD;
work to fran e some good excuse.&#xD;
Prompt to the hour, Nickols called, and notwithstanding&#xD;
Vaughan's resolution to excuse hui~self, Niekols found him&#xD;
ready and waiting; and he was pleased to find that though&#xD;
elegantly dressed, it was in perfect taste, and none of tli~ ex-&#xD;
travagant display of finery with which he had been in the&#xD;
habit of disfiguring hiinself, giving to him so much the air&#xD;
of a dandy. lie was rather sedate-almdst grave. Nickols&#xD;
rallied him about his gravity, feared he was going to turn&#xD;
parson, etc., but to no purpose. One who had seen him a&#xD;
few months previous on his way to call upon the junior of&#xD;

the late firm of Vaughan &amp;amp;&#xD;
him as the same.         (Jo., would not have recognized&#xD;
They found Mrs. St. Cloud's neatly but plainly furnished&#xD;
parlors filled with company. Alice did all that childlike&#xD;
snnphc~ty could do to entertain each of her worshippers, and&#xD;
each felt that she had done the very thing he wanted done.&#xD;
As the evening waned, one and another, as by common con-&#xD;
sent, gave place to Vaughan, who soon monopolized the&#xD;
attention of the young hostess. Nickols was the last to leave,&#xD;
and he had long since made his adieus to Mrs. St. Cloud&#xD;
and gone hawking home, when Frank and Alice were aroused&#xD;
from a blissful revery by the clock striking one! lie was&#xD;
astonished! she was astonished! both were astonished! lie&#xD;
thought there must be some mistake; she thought there&#xD;
must be some mistake; both thought therQ must be some&#xD;
mistake. He felt ~?or his watch; but, alas! the counterfeit&#xD;
Duke had stolen it, and he had not felt able to replace it.&#xD;
The thought fell upon his hopes and true manly affections...&#xD;
sunning themselves in the smiles of the most beautiful and&#xD;
lovely creature he had ever seen-.like the frost upon violets,&#xD;
wilting their bloom and freshness, lie stammered out an&#xD;
apology and tore himself away, and with anathemas, deep&#xD;
but not loud, found his way to his room, and lay down to&#xD;
dream of an angel with wings half folded and a robe of light&#xD;
cloud floating about her; and as she approaches him, and he&#xD;
is about to fold her in his arms, rind become pure and immortal&#xD;
like to the angel herself; it vanishes, and he is left alone.&#xD;
From the time of the dissolution of the firm, Vaughan was,&#xD;
to all inteiits, a changed man; and but few would have re-&#xD;
coo&#xD;
gnized, in the solid man of business, the eounselloratlaw&#xD;
No. Oxford street, the Frank Vaughan, Esq., of Duke&#xD;

&#xD;
polled to submit to many a hard rub, and severe joke. For a&#xD;
long time he bore it like a philosopher, or rather like a&#xD;
martyr; for he had the good sense to understand that the&#xD;
joke was altogether too goo&amp;amp;-toO pregnant with fun-to&#xD;
freeze up by a cold, haughty demeanor; and an effort to do&#xD;
it before it became stale, he saw would not only fail, but in-&#xD;
crease the sport ~nd compromise the modern Frank Vaughan.&#xD;
Hence, from month to month he winced under the cognomen&#xD;
of "Don John," and was compelled to smile at the constant&#xD;
salutation: "How is the Duke this morning?"&#xD;
His patience finally gave way at this persistence of his&#xD;
friends in identifying him with a dead man-a myth; and to&#xD;
check the injustice, and to remove the delusion with as much&#xD;
effect and 6clat as possible, he issued cards to those of his&#xD;
friends who had taken the largest liberty with him to join&#xD;
him in a wine supper. They were pleased, and hailed it as&#xD;
a return to himself; for notwithstanding the, name and per-&#xD;
son seemed to be the same, they saw and felt that he was&#xD;
not the same pleasure~lOving, dressy, band-box of a man they&#xD;
had formerlrknown.&#xD;
The wit and wine flowed freely, and, in the midst of the&#xD;
hilarity,, one of the guests rapped for silence, and proposed&#xD;
as ~toast:&#xD;
"Mine host, the 'Duke,' long life to him; and when it&#xD;
shall please Hymen that he depart from us and be no more,&#xD;
may he be received by a Saii&amp;amp;t enveloped in a 6floud; and in&#xD;
casting his mantle, may it fall upon shoulders more deserving&#xD;
than a piece of counterfeit."&#xD;
The toast was receive with vociferous applause, and when&#xD;
the noise subsided, Vaughan arose to respond. He was grave&#xD;
almost to sternness, and his voice trembled slightly as he&#xD;
spoke: "Gentlemen, you are my guests, and I thank you&#xD;
for becoming so; and what transpires here to-night, under&#xD;
what is temporarily my roof, I desire to be held by you as&#xD;
&#xD;
165y&#xD;
&#xD;
sacred a~ if Occurring around the family-board in the freedom&#xD;
of home intercourse. You have enjoyed yourselves at my&#xD;
expense for several moons past; I have borne it without re-&#xD;
sentuient if not with patience. It was a good joke; II was&#xD;
the victim of my own vanity and folly, and I felt disposed to&#xD;
allow my friends the largest liberty, and ~~ou have used it as&#xD;
I should have done if our positions had been reversed. But&#xD;
all things must have an end, and why not this? Ii have in-&#xD;
vited you here to-night that you may enjoy yourselves to the&#xD;
full. I want no one to feel under restraint. I want you to&#xD;
run your joke to the uttermost; I shall enjoy it with you.&#xD;
But mark me: the man who says Duke or IDon John to me&#xD;
after he passes that door will have to answer to me for the&#xD;
insult-as such will I consider it. I do not say this as a&#xD;
threat, or to intimidate; far otherwise. I like you all, and I&#xD;
hope you like me in return; and 'I beg you will not ti~ke&#xD;
offence at what I say. It is not so intended. And I hope,&#xD;
further, that you will riot allow it to check the hilarity of the&#xD;
evening.&#xD;
"One other remark: If I have ever been so weak as to&#xD;
affect coquetry, I hope I am cured of it; and hence, I will&#xD;
not affect not to understand the allusion in the toast to Miss&#xD;
St. Cloud. The author of it must allow me to say, with the&#xD;
utmost kind feeling for him, that such an allusion was in bad&#xD;
taste. I cOnceive it highly improper that the name of any&#xD;
young lady should be mentioned upon an occasion like the&#xD;
present, and more especially the one named."&#xD;
The silence that succeeded was almost oppressive. It was&#xD;
broken by the gentleman who first proposed the toast, lie&#xD;
had the grace and good-humor to rise and say: "Vaughan&#xD;
is right, boys. We have run him hard enough, and for one,&#xD;
I am satisfied with n~y share, and will stop. And I beg your&#xD;
pardon, Vaughan, and that of the young lady upon whose&#xD;
name I had the extreme had taste to make a very bad pun,&#xD;

for having coupled her name and yours in that way. And,&#xD;
gentlemen, if you will fill again, I will give you the health&#xD;
of our friend Frank Vaughan, Attorney at Law, up stairs-&#xD;
'always to be found at his office, except when absent on pro-&#xD;
fessional ~usiness'-Nay he be as successful in the business&#xD;
road upon which he has started as his best friends can desire,&#xD;
and may he not find it a 'hard road to travel."'&#xD;
This had the effect to restore the joyous feeling, and a&#xD;
happy evening was writ down in the memorieS of all present.&#xD;
The next summer Col. CJarkson brought Agnes home to&#xD;
spend her vacation. She had grown a most beautiful and&#xD;
attractive girl, ~with the appearance of a woman and niiivet~&#xD;
of a child. What a well-spring of joy opened to her as she&#xD;
reached her home once more-the meeting of mother and&#xD;
father, ~of sisters and brothers, of dear Alice, and all her&#xD;
friends ~ How the heart gushed over with love V How (lear&#xD;
each familiar spot, and how thickly the sweet memories come!&#xD;
She was too young to feel the restraints which society&#xD;
imposes, and her heart was ready to boi~ind at each generous&#xD;
impulse.&#xD;
She had not, disappointed the bright promise of her youth;&#xD;
and every plan which her fond parents could suggest for the&#xD;
enjoyment of herself and sweet Alice, as she was called,&#xD;
was arranged; and time sped by upon his fleetest wink. It&#xD;
was a beautiful sight to see these lovely girls mounted upon&#xD;
their handsome ponies-a present from the ever-indulgent&#xD;
Mr. Clarkson-every evening in the early fall, as the sun was&#xD;
stooping to the west, galloping in full riding costume over&#xD;
the hills and across the valleys in the neighborhood of town,&#xD;
their shadows spanning t~he deep ravines, and bounding along&#xD;
on the opposite hill-side like rival equestriennes.&#xD;
The city is built, or rather is being built, for it is far from&#xD;
being finished, upon a high, precipitous ram~ge of hills, which&#xD;
take their start some hundred or more miles below and run&#xD;

along the edge of the swamp, jutting into the river, as at&#xD;
Natchez, Rodney, and Vicksburg. Those about l3luff City are&#xD;
wild and very romantic, rising above the level of the river from&#xD;
three to five hundred feet. By means of deep grading, and the&#xD;
filling up of gorges, the city is made not only habitable, but&#xD;
one of the most beautiful and picturesque upon the river.&#xD;
From "Crown Point," a high hill about a mile above the&#xD;
city, is the finest view to be had anywhere on the river south&#xD;
of the Ohio. Th0 road leading to it was at that time rugged&#xD;
and ragged, and was one of the favorite rides of the two fair&#xD;
equestriennes. Almost every deep, shady glen or dell had its&#xD;
tragic l~istory of the robber, Phelps, the daring bandit of&#xD;
Mississippi, who was shot by the sheriff, upon the court&#xD;
green, in an attempt to escape, the day before he was to have&#xD;
been hung, or as affording a secure retreat for the horde of&#xD;
desperate gamblers who once infested the city, and whose&#xD;
daring misdeeds so far outraged a forbearing but incensed&#xD;
and enraged public as to force them to seize and hang the&#xD;
ringleaders, and break up their dens about town, and expel&#xD;
the rest. An old house now stands where the gallows was ~&#xD;
erected upon which those who were seized w~re hung, near&#xD;
what is termed the "old graveyard." One accustoi~ed to&#xD;
see graveyards carefully fenced, and white stones erected, to&#xD;
tell the passer-by who. rest under them, would not have&#xD;
recognized it as a place where the dead sleep, but rather&#xD;
a piece of common pasture. Cattle and live - stock of all&#xD;
k&#xD;
inds grazed leisurely over and trod rudely upon the ashes&#xD;
of the dead. But then it must be considered that this&#xD;
was" the old graveyard,~' the graves of the early settlers of&#xD;
Mississippi; that a people who lived in log-cabins that would&#xD;
hardly protect them from th&amp;amp; winds and the rains of winter.,&#xD;
and t~he burning suns of summer, could not be expected to&#xD;
adorn and beautify the house of the dead, who felt not the&#xD;
wind nor the sunshine, nor heeded the -rattle pf storm. A&#xD;

new generation of people, however, had taken the place of&#xD;
the old pioneers whose bones were thus left without a finger-&#xD;
board to warn the careless tQ "tread lightly," and a new&#xD;
state of things inaugurated with regard to the dead-a new&#xD;
graveyard purchased in a lovely yale north-east of the town,&#xD;
where after "life's fitful fever" the dead sleep well. It lies&#xD;
betweeti two long, huge hills; and its whitewashed fence,&#xD;
thick studding of gray and white marble, and long lines of&#xD;
bending willows and creeping rose-vines, present a sad but&#xD;
pleasing effect view ~d from \the top of the hill a mile or more&#xD;
to the south. I&#xD;
Over all these tragic and classic grounds these charming,&#xD;
light-hearted maidens galloped or walked their ponies, as the&#xD;
mood moved them. Upon ~Jrown Point they would haul up,&#xD;
after a brisk gallop, and si~ and watch the play of the last&#xD;
rays of the sun, as they softened the* broad landscaPe that&#xD;
spread out for miles and miles before them, and listen to the&#xD;
eternal gurgle of the river as it washed the base of the hill&#xD;
far below them. The river makes a turn at the point of the&#xD;
hill, and the two ends run parallel for ten or twelve miles,&#xD;
giving a view of the river for upwards of twenty, upon ~vhich&#xD;
the most magnificent steamers were ever moving, lashing to&#xD;
foam its muddy waters, with the perpetual splash of their&#xD;
paddJes. A full view was also had of the busy city, sloping&#xD;
from the highest hill-top to the Aver's edge, with its church&#xD;
spires piercing the clouds, its long rows of business houses,&#xD;
fine edifices, with their broad piazzas shaded by the deep rich&#xD;
green of the China tree, and the old, rusty court-house, where&#xD;
many of Mississippi'S great men, whose names will brighten&#xD;
the page of her history, when some son that loves her deeds&#xD;
shall choose to chronicle them, took their rise. It was a pic-&#xD;
ture worthy of the best inspiration of the artist-those girls&#xD;
sitting upon their palfreys, hat in hand, and hair floating in&#xD;
a mass about their shoulders, that of Alice sweeping down&#xD;

he4 back to the saddle-skirts----.watching the setting sun, and&#xD;
the~ gathering up the reins and bounding away, the evening&#xD;
breeze revelling with their long locks.&#xD;
Upon these occasions they very rarely had any other escort&#xD;
than Ponto; for the young gentlemen who had sensibility&#xD;
enough to appreciate it, felt that the presence of a third per-&#xD;
son would have marred rather than enhanced the pleasure of&#xD;
t~uchi excursions. Such commonplace subjects as beaux and&#xD;
balls and parties never entered their heads, much less their&#xD;
hearts; and lie would have deserved the fate of Prometheus&#xD;
who would have disturbed their summer elysium by designedly&#xD;
kindling in their hearts the fire of love. Hence they rode&#xD;
when and where and as their free fancy pointed. Agnes&#xD;
never saw company. SJie was too young, and had no desire&#xD;
for it; and if she had had the desire, Mrs. Clarkson was&#xD;
much too prudent a mother to have permitted her to gratify&#xD;
it. Alice, however, was crowded with company each even-&#xD;
ing, of both sexes; but the adulation paid her did not in any&#xD;
way deface the beauty of her character or corrupt the simplicity&#xD;
of her manners. Her watchful mother, however, soon notui~ed&#xD;
that she was restless and uneasy when Vaughan failed to make&#xD;
his accustomed visit, and felt anxious about it, but deemed it&#xD;
prudent to say nothing about it. Agnes had never seen him~&#xD;
nor heard Alice speak of him or any other gentleman. The&#xD;
pastimes and compliments of the drawing-room never formed&#xD;
the subject of discourse between the young ladies; and&#xD;
Agnes was of course ignorant that the empire of her dear&#xD;
friend's heart was threatened to be disputed by a very&#xD;
formidable rival; nor was Alice herself aware of it. A very&#xD;
trifling incident revealed it to Agnes. One afternoon, late,&#xD;
as they were standing upon the upper balcony, Vaughan&#xD;
passed, and politely lifted his hat. The salutation ~brought&#xD;
the color to Alice's face, and she looked after him abstract-&#xD;

edly, until he turned the corner. Agnes put her hand&#xD;
around her, and said, in a half-whisper:&#xD;
"Who was that mild, handsome gentleman ?"&#xD;
Alice put her head on Agnes's shoulder, looked up into&#xD;
her face with the sweetest and most innocent look in the&#xD;
world, and in the same tone answered:&#xD;
"Mr. Vaughan."&#xD;
"I have read something of love in books, dear Alice, and&#xD;
II have at times thought you were too pure to love any thing&#xD;
but God, your devoted mother, the bright sky, and sweet&#xD;
flowers; but you let those large eyes of yours fall so softly&#xD;
upon Mr~ Vaughan, and you looked so anxiously after him as&#xD;
he turned the corrierZ~~~~"&#xD;
"Hush! hush! my darling Agnes, do not finish what Ii see&#xD;
is on your lips. I cannot hear it. Mr. Vaughan is betrothed&#xD;
already. Earthly love, my sweet friend, is not for me; IF feel&#xD;
theree" laying her hand upon her heart.&#xD;
"0! you will marry some time," said Agnes, trying to be&#xD;
cheerful; "almost every one does, you know.&#xD;
"No! I shall never marry; Ii have never thought of it.&#xD;
Were Mr. Vaughan free to offer mO his hand, I would not&#xD;
wish it. I would not have him ask me, for I feel certain that&#xD;
earth has no home for me other than the sweet one of my&#xD;
idolized mother. Look yonder, dear Agnes, do you see that&#xD;
beautiful cluster of stars? how soft and pure their light!&#xD;
It is the light of heaven, and my home, sweet one, will be&#xD;
there.~~&#xD;
Agnes could ~ot speak, but she drew her arm more tightly&#xD;
around her friend, kissed away the tear which lay upon her&#xD;
cheek, and walked with her silently up and down the gallery.&#xD;
Not long after Agnes returned to school, Alice ceased her&#xD;
rides, and resisted all the entreaties of Vaughan and others&#xD;
to join them in their gallops over the hills. Her rides were&#xD;
sacred to the memory of her absent friend.&#xD;

MRS. HALE.&#xD;
TilE ensuing summer, Agnes completed her education, and&#xD;
Col. Clarkson and his family spent the season, in company&#xD;
with Mrs. St. Cloud and Mice, and a number of other Bluff&#xD;
City notables, at "Cooper's Well," a new watering~place, just&#xD;
then becbmning famous. It was situated in hinds county, in&#xD;
a poor, sandy, pine-woods country. The causes which led to&#xD;
the digging of the well, and its great popularity as a healer of&#xD;
the people, and a place of fashionable resort for pleasure-&#xD;
seekers, were supernatural a~md singular enough. It took its&#xD;
name from the original proprietor, Rev. Mr. Cooper, or&#xD;
"Brother Cooper," as he was universally called. He was a&#xD;
distinguished and popular and talented divine of the Methodist&#xD;
Church, a denomination numbering a vast, multitude of wor-&#xD;
shippers throughout lVllssissippi and the adjoining States.*&#xD;
~ The Rev. Mr. Cooper here spoken of now sleeps with his fathers,&#xD;
and that voice whose deep tones have echoed and reechoed so often&#xD;
in the wilds of Mississippi, calling the ungodly to repentance, is now&#xD;
tuned in harmony with that of angels on high, sounding the eternal&#xD;
praise of Almighty God.&#xD;

The reverend gentleman must not take offence at the truthful&#xD;
history here given, for the writer esteems him highly, and&#xD;
would, under no circumstances, give him pain.&#xD;
"Brother Cooper" was a tall, raw-boned, cadaverous-look-&#xD;
ing man, his skin as dark as a Spaniard's; dark, deep-set&#xD;
eyes, black wire-looking hair, heavy eyebrows, prominent&#xD;
cheek-hones, sunken cheeks, and a sepulchral voice, which&#xD;
was sufficiently powerful when at its full compass to he heard&#xD;
over five acres of camp-ground, without breaking, and appa-&#xD;
rently without effort. He was devotedly attached to his re-&#xD;
ligion, an enthusiast, and many regarded him as somewhat&#xD;
cracked-a monomaniac upon such subjects as took strong&#xD;
hold of his powerful imagination. His great reputation as a&#xD;
pulpit orator, and his powers of description, especially his&#xD;
descriptions of the fate of tho damned, "the lake of fire where&#xD;
the smoke of their torment ascended up for ever and ever,"&#xD;
were so awfully graphic and grand, that crowds, everywhere,&#xD;
of all classes, would gather to hear him. And his piety and&#xD;
sincerity gave weight to all he said. He dug his well in obe-&#xD;
dience to a strange dream that made a deep impression upon&#xD;
him. He had told it to his frienfls, and the fame of it pre~&#xD;
ceded him to his appointment; and such was the morbid&#xD;
appetite of the public for the marvellous and supernatural,&#xD;
that crowds would press around him and urge the recital of&#xD;
his dream; and in this way he acquired the habit of relating&#xD;
it in his sermons, with many other wild and thrilling im-&#xD;
aginings, and visions from the spirit-land. "In my dream,"&#xD;
he would say, in that deep, solemn voice, "when deep sleep&#xD;
had fallen upon me, a voice appeared find said to me:&#xD;
'Brother Cooper, dig a well!' I woke, and thought Po&#xD;
more of it. The second night, at the self-same hour, it said:&#xD;
'Brother Coop~~r, dig a well!' I treated it as a sleeping&#xD;
fancy, hut it took strong hold of my mind, and I found it&#xD;
difficult to shake myself loose from its hold upon my mind.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
The next night at the same hour it said: 'Brother Cooper,&#xD;
dig a well !' I asked: 'Where shall I dio~?' It said, 'Fo~-&#xD;
low, and Twill show you where you shall dig!' I followed,&#xD;
and was led to a retired spot in a deep vale, where I should&#xD;
not have thought of planting my spade for water. The next&#xD;
morning I awoke, and so vivid was my dream that I arose&#xD;
and without difficulty found the spot. I took my wife and&#xD;
showed her the spot, and related my dream.~ She said, 'It is&#xD;
from God!' I said, 'Then I will dig.' I hired a man, and&#xD;
began to dig. He labored to dissuade me, but I said, 'Dio~ ~&#xD;
After digging a number of days and no sign of water, he&#xD;
laughed at what he called my superstition, and quit, and I&#xD;
abandoned the work. i~ut again in my dream the voice said:&#xD;
'Brother Cooper, finish the well!' I hired another worker~,&#xD;
and he likewise grew disheartened and ceased to work, and&#xD;
again I resolved to abandon the digging; but again the voice&#xD;
said: 'Brother Cooper, finish the well!' I hired another&#xD;
digger, and the profane man said he would dig until he found&#xD;
water or the brimstone that fed the lake of everlasting flame.&#xD;
He found water, but the smell and taste were so offensive,&#xD;
that no domestic use could be made of it. I knew not of its&#xD;
medicinal qualities; my skill in the healing art extended only&#xD;
to the sin-sick soul, and not to the perishing frame. Poor,&#xD;
weak mortal that [ was, and hard of belief:, I thought my&#xD;
imagination had trifled with my judgment, or that some foul&#xD;
fiend had tempted me to sin, and the windlass and crank were&#xD;
left to rot. But God would not suffer what he had provided&#xD;
for the healing of the nation to be lost through the ignorance&#xD;
and weakness of his sei~vant, who knew not what use to make&#xD;
of his gifts. Dr. , a man eminent in his profession, and&#xD;
a learned chemist, was perishing away ~with dyspepsia. His&#xD;
disease had baffled his own great skill, and that of the other&#xD;
physicians of the State, and, despairing of earthly help, he&#xD;
sought the balm of 'Gilead and the Physician there.' One&#xD;

ni~ht, after his weeping family had prayed around his bedside,&#xD;
an his devoted and pious wife, worn out with watching, had&#xD;
f9len to Aeep by his side, a voice in his sleep said: 'Drink&#xD;
of the water of the w~ll I will show you, and you shall be&#xD;
healed!' Thrice it thus spoke. The ne~t night it spoke&#xD;
thrice the same words in the same voice, and the next night&#xD;
thrice. Th~ third night, when it had spoken thrice, he said:&#xD;
'Show me the well!' He was shown the well, and a few&#xD;
days thereafter Ii was surprised to see him being borne upon&#xD;
a litter, prostrate and emaciated, into my house. He said he&#xD;
had come to drink of the water of my well, and told me his&#xD;
vision. I fell down upon my knees, and smote upon my&#xD;
breast, and said: 'Blessed be the Lord! He is wiser than&#xD;
L'e Some people say, 'Brother Cooper is crazy.' I love to&#xD;
be crazy like Brother Cooper. If living, and serving, and&#xD;
glorifying God is being crazy, I wish you were all crazy, just&#xD;
like Brother Cooper."&#xD;
This tiling~ told at every camp-meeting, c1uarterly-mceting,&#xD;

merits of the mineral water, gave to t~e well wide-spread re-&#xD;
putation, and the diseased flocked theiK as did those "sick of&#xD;
the palsy" to the "Pool of Bethesda.P And there Colonel&#xD;
Clarkson and his family went.&#xD;
This was Agnes's first season in society-the first season she&#xD;
was seen by or was permitted to see company. She and&#xD;
Alice were like, twin flowers, shedding odor and fre~liness&#xD;
around. Agnes was the taller of the two, and possessed more&#xD;
character, but, withal, gentle and easy in her manners. One&#xD;
was all love, the other admired as well as loved. In decision&#xD;
and point of character Agnes resembled her mother, but was&#xD;
more impressible. She had the same Grecian outline of face,&#xD;
the same clear, white skin 'when in repose as when first seen&#xD;
at the Hermit Bend, but when animated, her face was suf-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
fused with couleur de rose, and her lustrous eyes shone like&#xD;
stars. Her step was elastic and queen-like, and her voice&#xD;
soft and musical as Orpheus' lute, "strung with poets' sinews,"&#xD;
"Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,&#xD;
Make tigers tame, and huge leviathans&#xD;
Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands."&#xD;
And its effect was almost as great. For a number of even~&#xD;
ings in succession, the music of her voice, and the charm of&#xD;
her conversation, together with the beauty of her person,&#xD;
drew even the lovers of cards and brandy from their long&#xD;
sittings. Agnes was a natural musician, performing the com-&#xD;
positions of the best masters with an ease and grace rarely&#xD;
seen in private life. She loved to follow Mozart and l3ee-&#xD;
thoven through their graceful passages, and often became so&#xD;
engrossed with their music that she would seem almost in-&#xD;
spired with the genius of these great masters, and, forgetting&#xD;
all else, her whole soul would pour itself out in harmony so&#xD;
sweet, and sounds so touching, that few could listen unmoved.&#xD;
Even Colonel Isaacs, for whom ladies had but few attractions,&#xD;
left his cards and brandy to listen to her voice, and look Upon&#xD;
her surpassingly beautiful face and figure. To Alice, the sen-&#xD;
sation her friend creatQd was a source of great delight; but&#xD;
Agnes was unaccustomed to the adulation and compliments&#xD;
of the gay fashionable world, and it all pressed heavily upon&#xD;
her young heart, and she loved the quiet of her room, with&#xD;
Alice by her side, far more than the gay festivities of the&#xD;
saloons, with all their fascinations. Her mind was pure-the&#xD;
world had not yet touched her~ with its withering breath, and&#xD;
she could not understand or appreciate its hollow pleasures&#xD;
or unmeaning gallantries. There were at the Well an un-&#xD;
usually large number of visitors, ~ind Alice and Agnes soon&#xD;
collected about them a circle of elegant and accomplished&#xD;
young ladies and gentlemen, who, like themselves, preferred&#xD;

&#xD;
something more rational than the adulation and compliments&#xD;
a heartless, pleasur&amp;amp;-seeking crowd. Frank Vaughan was&#xD;
one of their circle, and no one added more to their happiness&#xD;
or amusement; he was quiet, but never obtrusive, and when&#xD;
the young ladies were compelled to have a gallant, he was&#xD;
always welcome.&#xD;
Nrs. Co~bin and her daughter were at the Well, and the&#xD;
attention p ~iid by Vaughan to Miss Alice gave her great un-&#xD;
easiness. Clara did not seem to notice it in the least, but&#xD;
flirted away with every new beau who offered his coat-sleeve,&#xD;
and the newer he was the better. It was her boast that she&#xD;
caught all the new beaux; but, to an attentive observer, it&#xD;
was very plain that her favors were more especially given to&#xD;
the young ~Louisiana attorney.&#xD;
This kind of life was so new to* Agnes, that after the no-&#xD;
velty had worn off a little, she and Alice longed for the quiet&#xD;
of their homes, the hills, their ponies, and old rides. Mrs.&#xD;
St. Cloud readily consented to take them back with her, and&#xD;
Mrs. Clarkson was not sorry when Agnes complained of the&#xD;
distaste which she had for the idle flatteries with which her&#xD;
ears were nightly filled, and gladly assented to the arrange-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
The lovers of conquest could not understand how two reign-&#xD;
ing belles could, in the full tide of a successful season, leave&#xD;
the scene of their triumphs, and score of worshipers, for the&#xD;
seclusion of home, and the society of each other. Could&#xD;
these votaries of fashion have seen the smile of pleasure, the&#xD;
look of love and happiness with which these young girls re-&#xD;
sumed their old but rational pursuits, and could they have&#xD;
entered into their occupation as Alice and Agnes did-~---the&#xD;
reading of standard works, the music, their sweet voices&#xD;
mingling in harmony, the kind word to the afflicted, and the&#xD;
charity to the needy-could they have seen all this, and then&#xD;
have witnessed the content and satisfaction with which they&#xD;
&#xD;
176&#xD;
&#xD;
over the hills on their fleet ponies, they might have&#xD;
felt that woman's destiny is not confined to the artificial and&#xD;
transient pleasures of the gay world, and that reason holds&#xD;
her empire far above emptiness and folly.&#xD;

Till, with Circean cups thy mind possessed,&#xD;

TilE evening after Alice and Agnes left the Well, Vaughan&#xD;
was gloomy and taciturn, and to relieve his ennui detcrniined&#xD;
tojoin Colonel Isaacs and some others in a game of cards.&#xD;
When he proposed to do so, Colonel Isaacs asked him to one&#xD;
side, and said:&#xD;
"Frank,~ my friend, I would advise you not to play."&#xD;
"Why? There is no harm in it."&#xD;
"Yes, there is harm in it, particularly in your state of&#xD;
mind."&#xD;

"Pshaw! you can't deceive anybQdy; your face ~s a table&#xD;

You love Alice St. Cloud; and you are right, my boy. Marry&#xD;
her, Frank, if she will have you, ai~d there is no reason why&#xD;
she should not. You have talent, and no bad habits, and&#xD;
your prospects for business are good, and daily improving,&#xD;
and your person comely enough to please any woman. Some&#xD;
time since I would not have said this much to you; it would&#xD;
have spoiled you then, but you have improved since."&#xD;
"I thank you for your good opinion; but I never expect&#xD;
the good fortune to marryAlice St. Cloud."&#xD;
"Why not?"&#xD;
&#xD;

"How do you. know? Have you ever asked her ?"&#xD;
"I have not, and would not for my right arm."&#xD;
"Nonsense, Frank. I thought you were done with ro-&#xD;

not wantingg to marry. All that is needed is a good chance,&#xD;

she very soon will. If your reported engagement&#xD;

be the cause of restraining you from obeying the&#xD;
impulse of your heart to offer your hand to sweet little Alice,&#xD;
you be honest with Miss Clara and yourself and disclose&#xD;
to her the truth, and break with her at once. The mother&#xD;
may storm, and say a few scandalous things~ but, my word for&#xD;
it, the daughter will not care a sou. She likes thap poet-&#xD;
quoting Louisiana attorney better to-day than she does ybu, and&#xD;
he will very easily console her for the loss of a lover that&#xD;
cares nothing for her, and for whom she cares but little."&#xD;
"My relations with Miss Corbin are partly the cause, and&#xD;
a sufficient one, why I should not address Miss Alice St.&#xD;
Cloud, but not the only nor the most material one. It&#xD;
is no vanity in m~ to say that I[ believe I am not an object&#xD;
of aversion to Mi~s Alice; indeed, I think she likes nie as&#xD;
well as a pure, single-minded creature such as she can like&#xD;
any gentleman. But I cannot be mistaken in believing that&#xD;
she has never thought of marrying any one;. and my own&#xD;
appreciation of her tells me that it would distress her no&#xD;
little to be compelled to think of it; and I would, like the&#xD;
brave 'Mutius~' put my. hand in the fire, and let it burn to&#xD;

not peering eagerly about her for a husband, and who felt&#xD;

her age. So d~ you take my advice, and marry sweet Alice&#xD;

"I cannot ask Miss Alice St. Cloud to be my wife; though&#xD;
I would not only brave Mrs. Corbin's displeasure, but a whole&#xD;
regiment, to call her mine. But when I look into her sweet&#xD;
face, and meet the light of her gentle eyes, and, above all,&#xD;
when I feel the influence of her pure nature upon me, my&#xD;
wish to marry her is rebuked, and I feel, that I stand before&#xD;
one too good, too spiritual, and possessing too much of&#xD;

"His equal, at least," Vaughan modestly said.&#xD;
"Ay, 'his equal, at least!' Then why not his equal in&#xD;
fame? Why are not my name and deeds, like his, trum-&#xD;
peted round the world? Why am I 'shrunk to this little&#xD;
measure?' I'll tell you why; Cards and 'brandy! Drink-&#xD;

to count the game! If I had never seen a card nor a brandy~&#xD;
bottle, I might have been high in command in the army, or a&#xD;
Congressman, Senator, or what I listed! Beware of them,&#xD;
sir: they are more fatal to ambition than the blades of&#xD;
Brutus and the 'envious Casca.' The great' body' of the&#xD;
people are virtuous; and no mere slave to vice can be their&#xD;
servant long, if they know of his bondage. A judicious&#xD;
niarriage might, nay, it would have saved me, and, instead&#xD;
of b9ing as now, a Satyr to that Hyperion, I would have&#xD;
been his compeer. Hear the warning of a man who has&#xD;
drunk deep at every fountain of excess: Beware of cards&#xD;
and dice, wine and bad women. The breath of the Upas&#xD;
tree is not more fatal to life than they to innocence and&#xD;
virtue. Beware of them! Like the faithful Kent, 'I have&#xD;

There are few men I choose to warn, and still fewer occas ons&#xD;

As Vaughan was exprc~sing his thanks for the interest&#xD;
manifested in staying his first step to ruin, the door opened,&#xD;
and Capt. Orr came in.&#xD;
"Captain," said the Colonel, "I have just been warning&#xD;
Frank to 'beware of cards and dice, wine and bad women.'&#xD;
Your experience is worth something. Am I correct ?"&#xD;
"You are, and more. You arc young, Frank, and as yet&#xD;
the 'trail of the serpent,' as the pious would say, has left no&#xD;
mark on you; and if you would not have it leave one that&#xD;
will act as a mildew upon every hope and aspiration of your&#xD;
life, take Col. Isaacs7 advice. And let mc emphasize the last&#xD;
clause: 'For the lips of a strange [bad] woman drop as an&#xD;
honeycomb, and her mouth is smoothes than oil; but her end&#xD;
is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. 1-Jer&#xD;
feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.' You see&#xD;

I can quote Scripture; so can the devil. See that you prac-&#xD;
tice it. Excuse what I have said, and, if you will allow me,&#xD;
I will deprive you of Col. Isaacs' company." Saying which,&#xD;
the two left the room for the card-table.&#xD;
lit was not likely that, against the warning of two uch&#xD;
men as Isaacs and Orr, Vaughan should go to the ~ard-t le.&#xD;
lie was satisfied that they had gone there, and for som time&#xD;
after the door closed h~ stood without moving even his eyes,&#xD;
and then said: "Go; but as for me, see you, ' li'll go pray.~&#xD;
And for the first time since lie lisped his child's prayer by his&#xD;
mother's knee, he bent before the great God, saying: "Lead&#xD;
me not into temptation, buf deliver me from evil."&#xD;
The next day lie left the Well and returned home, and&#xD;
employed his first leisure hour in calling upon Alice and&#xD;
Agnes. The pleasure the young ladies expressed at seeing&#xD;
hini assured him of his welcome.&#xD;
"You came home earlier than you expected ?" asked Miss&#xD;
Agnes.&#xD;
"Yes, soniewhat. The whirl of every thing there rather&#xD;
dizzied than entertained; and after you two had left, nothing&#xD;
remained to compensate me for the wearisomeness which&#xD;
succeeds the intoxication. II shall be lonesome at homey, as&#xD;

"'Because Agnes plays a very fine game."&#xD;
" You think sQ, dear Alice, because I beat you sometimes'.&#xD;
Mr. Frank may be a more formidable opponent."&#xD;

" Well, we shall see ;" and off he started to fulfil his com--&#xD;
mission with an amount of pleasure he, was scarcely able to&#xD;
estimate.&#xD;
.When the young ladies ,advised Mrs. St. Cloud of what&#xD;
they had done, she looked a little grave, and Alice said:-&#xD;
"Dear mother, I hope we have done nothing wrong ?"&#xD;
" Not exactly wrong, my daughter, but a little imprudent.&#xD;
Familiarity with young men is never advisable. ' Have&#xD;
charity for all; but familiarity is not expedient .'&#xD;
" I am so sorry we have displeased you," said Agnes. "I&#xD;
never thought of the impropriety, and do not see it now ex-&#xD;
actly; but I know you would not condemn what we have&#xD;
done if it were not wrong. Mr. Frank seemed so lonsm&#xD;
that I .could not say no to his proposition. As I made the&#xD;
bargain, I will break it when he comes."&#xD;
"No, do not do that. Let it stand as it is. He might&#xD;
not understand it rightly, and you could not, by any possible&#xD;
explanation, place matters upon the indifferent basis they&#xD;
were on before. He is an honorable young man, and I believe&#xD;
you may trust him to the full extent of his engagement; and&#xD;
I would not have you uselessly wound him. All I ask is that&#xD;
you be prudent and avoid all familiarity. Do you always  e&#xD;
gard him, and let him always regard himself; as a visitor&#xD;
Let him come when it suits him, and go when it suits him;&#xD;
but do you receive and dismiss him as any other gentleman.&#xD;
Fail in no respect to him less than to a stranger, and exact&#xD;
the same from him that you would from a stranger. In other&#xD;
respects fulfil your bargain."&#xD;
" I understand you, I think," said Agnes, "and will not&#xD;
fail to profit by what you have said." Both of them put&#xD;
their arms around the true, good mother and friend and&#xD;
kissed her.&#xD;
The evening was a very pleasant one to all. Vaughan&#xD;
found his boast premature. Out of three games, Agnes beat&#xD;

him two, and tl~e third was a stale-mate. Music and con-&#xD;
versation succeeded chess, and all were mutually pleased and&#xD;
happy. Mrs~ St. Cloud was noticed, at a seasonable hour, to&#xD;
leave the room, and soon after a little bell rang and the&#xD;
servants went quietly in, when her voice was heard reading&#xD;
the evening prayers, the servants responding. Conversation&#xD;
ceased in the parlor, and Frank indicated his willingness to&#xD;
join them in the evening devotions, and Alice was in the act&#xD;
of leading the way into the oratory, when checked by a look&#xD;
from Agnes, who remembered Mrs. St. Cloud's advice, and&#xD;
thought such an act more familiar than her kind hostess and&#xD;
temporary guardian would approve. Vaughan understood&#xD;
and appreciated it. Trifling as the incident was, it had the&#xD;
effect of establishing the line of respectful deference, beyond&#xD;
which Vaughan's good sense told him he should not desire to&#xD;
go. It served to restrain him ever after when tempted to&#xD;
observe a familiarity and at-homeativeness which his contract&#xD;
might by some be thought to include.&#xD;
With this good understanding the time passed swiftly and&#xD;
happily and profitably. The young ladies recommended their&#xD;
rides-Vaughan joining them only when they intended ex-&#xD;
tending them farther than it was thought prudent to go&#xD;
without an escort.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
WHEN the families about town were breaking up and&#xD;
leaving for the summer season, and trades were becoming&#xD;
scarce, friend Piper's nostrils were spread and nose flatted,&#xD;
and Gilpin's tail drooped all the time. The failure of "the&#xD;
girls" to secure husbands, and the possibility of their becom-&#xD;
ing old maids, tormented him beyond measure. When trades&#xD;
were plenty, in the flush of successful speculation he would&#xD;
forget "the girls," and the failure of his matrimonial specula-&#xD;
tions on their account; but when trades became dull, the&#xD;
vision of four old spinsters haunted him when awake, and&#xD;
was a nightmare in his sleep, and h~ would form every im-&#xD;
aginable and childish plan for marrying them off, and talk and&#xD;
fret about it until home would cease to be home for any one&#xD;
about the house. Upon such occasions even "old Tom," a&#xD;
large gray cat, would leave his quiet place on the hearth-rug,&#xD;
and rich harvest of crumbs, chicken-bones, and mice, and&#xD;
take to the brier-patches and sage fields to feed upon spar-&#xD;
rows; Betsy would grow snappish, and let~ her tongue off at&#xD;
everybody and every thing; and "the girls" felt themselves to&#xD;
be unwelcome guests in their father's house. They were&#xD;
worked up to the belief that the failure to get husbands,&#xD;
whether men wante~l them for wives or not, was a crime, but&#xD;
one they were puzzled to atone for; for they naturally enough&#xD;
asked themselves, If men would not court them, how were&#xD;
they to compel them? They knew that Piper had done his&#xD;
part, and that Betsy had done her part; and that their part,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC8172-00000095"/>&#xD;
188         PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.&#xD;
which was to say "yes," when asked, alone remained to be&#xD;
done; but how could they say "yes" if they were not asked?&#xD;
If let alone, they would have thought but little about beaux&#xD;
or husbands, and cared less; but as it was, they had heard&#xD;
"Pa"* say so much about "old maids," that they had come to&#xD;
consider them as a most repulsive species of animated nature,&#xD;
and to be avoided at all hazards. Thus the years that might&#xD;
have been spent in the sweet enjoyment of home pleasures,&#xD;
and each other's society, secure from the blight of the worldly-&#xD;
minded, were poisoned, and were wasted in unavailing regrets&#xD;
and the most painful and choking of all the sensations that&#xD;
can distress the young and ardent-the consciousness of neg-&#xD;
lect, a feeling that they were not regarded as worthy as&#xD;
others.&#xD;
One Saturday evening, after a week of failure-not a trade&#xD;
had been made-Gilpin came home with his tail drooping,&#xD;
and Piper's nostrils spread wider, and his nose flatter&#xD;
than common, and the old song of "the girls" becoming old&#xD;
maids was begun. Things had not gone well with Betsy that&#xD;
day: the old Shanghai hen had refused to set, and had de-&#xD;
stroyed a whole setting of eggs, and the old sow had caught&#xD;
the turkey.hen sitting by the garden fence upon nineteen&#xD;
embryo turkeys, and eaten her up; and the calf had got to&#xD;
old "Pide" and sucked all the milk; so altogether she was&#xD;
in no humor to sympathize with old spinsters nor their&#xD;
anxious parents. Hence she cut the tune short by saying:&#xD;
"I don't want you to talk to me any more about the girls&#xD;
getting married. If you want to get rid of the girls-and&#xD;
gracious knows the sooner the better-""do with them like&#xD;
other folks do with their girls."&#xD;
"And how is that ?"&#xD;
"Fix them up and send them to the Well."&#xD;
"And spend ten dollars a week? You 'ye lost your senses&#xD;
if you think I 'in as big a fool as that."&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.                189&#xD;
"if you are too stingy to pay the expense necessary to&#xD;
marry them ofl, what do you keep 4 such a fuss about their&#xD;
marrying for? All the girls can't get husbands, so hu~lv&#xD;
your fuss about it.','&#xD;
"Betsydon't talk to me that way !"&#xD;
"How do you want me to talk ?"&#xD;
"You shan't talk to me that way !"&#xD;
"I'd like to know what'll prevent me? I'd like to know&#xD;
when yoi became too good for me to talk to? Things have&#xD;
come to a high pass when I must ask you what I shall say!&#xD;
Fine times it would be, for me to come whining about, 'Mr.&#xD;
Piper, may I say this?' before I am allowed to use my&#xD;
tongue! When it comes to this, sir, I'll bite my tongue off&#xD;
and let you put it in your pocket, along with the ends of&#xD;
your trades.''.&#xD;
Piper saw that he ~had better compromise; for though he&#xD;
could beat Betsy at ~ horse trade, she could beat him in the&#xD;
glish," and he had been too often foiled in a tilt&#xD;
of the kind with her, to desire a passage-at-arms with her;&#xD;
besides, in his struggles with the phantom of four old maids,&#xD;
he wanted her aid and sympathy. He therefore said in a&#xD;
much milder tone:&#xD;
am not going to take them to the Well, to spend all I've&#xD;
flirting about there, but I am willing they should go to&#xD;
some less expensive place."&#xD;
"Then take them to the country~-.-anywhere, so that I may&#xD;
~ rid of this everlasting ding-dong. Mr. Flinn asked me a&#xD;
short time ago to let them come and stay with his wife while&#xD;
he went to Texas to look at some lands. I reckon there's&#xD;
some men there, as well as at other places, so you can take&#xD;
them there."&#xD;
"Has he got room for them all ?" said Piper, n~uch in-&#xD;
terested.&#xD;
How do I know? If he has n't, what did he ask me to&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC8172-00000096"/>&#xD;
'190         PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.&#xD;
~cnd them for? I reckon he knows how many his house will&#xD;
hold, and he is not fool enough to run it over."&#xD;
"As he asked you, suppose you and the girls' Uncle Dick&#xD;
take them over. -&#xD;
"Well, I'll do any thing to get some peace from this old-&#xD;
maid song. I am tired of it, but I am not yet tired of my&#xD;
girls."&#xD;
Mr. Flinn lived upon one of the Bayous in the swamp, on&#xD;
the Louisiana side of the river, not quite two days' ride from&#xD;
Bluff City, and it was arranged that Betsy was to take one of&#xD;
"the girls" in the buggy, and that Piper was to practice upon&#xD;
uncle and swap him into procuring a conveyance to take the&#xD;
the other three. He could not think of hiring a hack for&#xD;
the purpose, for it would take the fat end off from a lean trade&#xD;
to pay for it, and, unwilling to undergo the expense of any&#xD;
other conveyance, he had recourse to good-natured Uncle&#xD;
Dick. He therefore starts off, and Gilpin once more hoists&#xD;
his tail, and gallops Piper down town.&#xD;
"0 Richard, let me see you a minute," and walks with&#xD;
him' to one side. "I have some very' important business on&#xD;
hand, and cannot possibly leave home just now, and Betsy&#xD;
has promised to take the girls over to Mr. Flinn's to spend a&#xD;
part of the summer. Mrs. Flinn is a particular friend of&#xD;
Betsy's, and Betsy hates to disappoint her, and I[ hate to&#xD;
disappoint the girls, but I cannot leave home, and I thought&#xD;
you might be able to go with them."&#xD;
"It is rather an inconvenielit itime for me to leave, though&#xD;
I suppose I can obtain leave of absence long enough for&#xD;
that; and rather than the girls shall be disappointed, IF will&#xD;
accompany theni."&#xD;
"It would be a pity to disappoint them, they have set&#xD;
their hearts on it so; and they have set their hearts on&#xD;
having you go along with them. I never saw girls so&#xD;
attached to anybody as they are to yQu. They make them..&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR A1VtUSEMENT.             191&#xD;
selves fools about you, and think you know every thing, and&#xD;
that I don't know any thing; and they are hardly&#xD;
turn around without you are with them."    willing to&#xD;
"I am glad they think thus well of ~e, and I desire to&#xD;
continue to merit their good opinion, though I can't hope&#xD;
much success."&#xD;
"You will meet with it by accompanying them to Mr.&#xD;
Flinn's. Betsy will take the buggy and Crooked-ears and&#xD;
one of the girls, and you can take the other three in with&#xD;
you.~~&#xD;
Uncle iDick flinched as if Piper had stuck something in&#xD;
him, but did not have the courage to say no. He knew the&#xD;
young ladies would feel the disappointment greatly, and he&#xD;
felt that the money spent in obliging them in a pastime of&#xD;
the sort was "kread cast upon the waters ;" and, as he had&#xD;
no one else to care for he had as well use his little means in&#xD;
purchasing them a summer respite, and let Piper save the&#xD;
odds and ends of his trades for the future.&#xD;
Pet ~yas extremely anxious to take ,a seat in the handsome&#xD;
conveyance hired by "Uncle Dick," drawn by a pair~ of&#xD;
blooded bays; but as Betsy had all the trouble of the thing,&#xD;
and had not regained her good-humor, she made Pet take a&#xD;
seat with her behind the mustang. The bays were fresh&#xD;
and spirited, and Uncle Dick loved a stiff rein, and he allowed&#xD;
them to dash off in a brisk trot. For the first dozen miles&#xD;
or so, while, the mustang was good-natured, Betsy managed,&#xD;
by dint of jerking and whipping, to keep along pretty well;&#xD;
but when the day grew warm, and the mustang became a&#xD;
little leg-weary, the whipping and jerking were to no purpose,&#xD;
and Crooked-ears took his own time. This worried Uncle&#xD;
Dick not a little, for lie saw that, owing to the obstinacy of&#xD;
the mustang, it would take at least -three days to make the&#xD;
trip-time which he could illy spare. The bays, eager to go&#xD;
on, had to be held in, and time hung heavily on them all,~&#xD;

and glad enough they were on the evening of the third day&#xD;
t reach the end of their journey.&#xD;
They were received with great kindness by Mr. Flinn,&#xD;
who had not only plenty of room, but a heart as big as his&#xD;
house, and Betsy and "the girls" soon felt that ease and sat-&#xD;
isfaction which always follows true hospitality. Uncle Dick&#xD;
forgot " Crooked-ears," and all sat -down to the bountiful&#xD;
supper, prepared by their kind hostess, with merry faces and&#xD;
light hearts. The girls felt free -the incubus of "not&#xD;
marrying," so often and uselessly obtruded upon them, had&#xD;
vanished; they saw that they were understood and appre-&#xD;
ciated, and every thing promised a happy and delightful&#xD;
summer.&#xD;

sH'AKSPEARE.&#xD;
DUIGthe summer the yellow fever prevailed to an&#xD;
alarming extent intecity of New Orleans, and, asBlf&#xD;
Cit wa indaily communication with it by means of steam-.&#xD;
botnavigation, serious fears were entertained that the fever&#xD;
woul bebroght o BuffCity, and the anxious citizens pre-&#xD;
vailed on the City Council to purcliase a quarantine-ground a&#xD;
mile or two below the city, and establish quarantine. As the&#xD;
fover increased in New Orleans, the fears of -the people of&#xD;
Bluff City increased in proportion. Daily some family or&#xD;
families might have been seen moving toward the railroad&#xD;
d~p6t with travelling equipage. Steamboat- travelling was&#xD;
entirely abandoned, as most of the boats bound upward had&#xD;
eases of fever on board. ,The inquiry of each citizen, as he&#xD;
met his neighbor in the morning, was, "Whatinews of the&#xD;
fever ?" The inquiry of their families, when they returned at&#xD;
night, was, " What news of the fever ?" and'the answer of each&#xD;
was, " Still on the increase." The daily reports of mortality&#xD;
from the Crescent City were heart-sickening to read. Rumors&#xD;
at last began to spread that eases had occurred in Bluff City,&#xD;
but they were in whispers. Every one feared, every one&#xD;
believed it to be in town, but no'one dared say so. The&#xD;
newspapers, the sentinels on watch, proclaimed, iin a grave-&#xD;
yard voice, "All's well." All knew and felt that the appear-&#xD;

ance of the fever in the town would ruin trade, and prostrate&#xD;
the energies of the city, just recovering from the effects of&#xD;
the over-speculationi and ruin which levelled all the industrial&#xD;
and commercial interests of the country some few years* pre-&#xD;
vious; and as a large proportion of the private families and&#xD;
citizens of leisure were out of town, the commercial interest,&#xD;
the buying and selling, made public opinion, and public&#xD;
opinion, like all other despots, was then, as now, tyrannical,&#xD;
muzzled the press, and si 10thered the cry of the suffering.&#xD;
In obedience to the desp ot, the Esculapiuses of town were&#xD;
compelled to invent all sdrts of names for the "Wandering&#xD;
Jew" that daily and nigh ly crept about the frightened town&#xD;
and stopped the breath of its good citizens. So long as the&#xD;
despot had one physician ho could say that he had not seen&#xD;
a case, it held all the oth rs tongue-tied. In silence the dis-&#xD;
ease worked, in silence science grappled with it; but disease&#xD;
was the stronger force. It was on Sunday morning when&#xD;
there was not left a physician who could say that he had not&#xD;
seen a case: each had a case, and some had scores, and all&#xD;
proclaimed that the fever was not only in the town, but was&#xD;
of the most "malignant type." The tap of the fire-bell at&#xD;
sea would not have alarmed the doomed crew more than did&#xD;
this announcement the people of Bluff City. Though all&#xD;
had felt its presence, this authoritative declaration was like&#xD;
the whispered statement, "lie is dead," to one who has&#xD;
watched long at the bedside ,of a dear friend, fearing, yet&#xD;
hoping. The excitement, and running to and fro, and mount-&#xD;
ing in hot haste, in "$Belgium's capital" at the approach of&#xD;
the foe,' was not greater than that occasioned by this an-&#xD;
nouncement. -Men and women ran frantically about, and,&#xD;
with white lipsycried, " The fever ! the fever !" The stream&#xD;
*of inhabitants fleeing from the disease stretched across the&#xD;
town, and .kept up a- heavy tramp and rumble all day on&#xD;
Sunday, and most of the day on Monday. Numbers, how-&#xD;

ever, could not leave, some on account of business, and others&#xD;
because members of their family had already been attacked,&#xD;
and could not be removed.&#xD;
The epidemic spread fearfully, and the mortality was fright-&#xD;
ful. All the remedies that had been successful in former&#xD;
years and in other places, seemed no moire than so much&#xD;
poison. At first the dead were carried to the graveyard in&#xD;
hearses with long black plumes, followed by large proces-&#xD;
sions of friends, moving slowly and solemnly; but as the dis-&#xD;
ease progressed, and the number of its victims multiplied,&#xD;
the processions grew thinner and moved faster, until corpses&#xD;
where whirled along in sweeping trots without a mourner.&#xD;
Every house was a hospital, and small pieces of black crape&#xD;
.hanging upon door-knobs everywhere over the town told that&#xD;
death had. entered there. Midnight was made awful by the&#xD;
wail of the bereaved.. It was like "Rachel weeping for her&#xD;
children." Business--houses were all closed and all business&#xD;
-stopped, and all the sounds of business were hushed, except&#xD;
the eternal rat, tat, tat, rat, tat, tat, Qf the sexton's hammer.&#xD;
The thoroughfares along which the tide of business had been&#xD;
accustomed to rush were' as silent as a city of the dead,&#xD;
broken only by the tramp of the hearse horse, or some soli-&#xD;
tary person seeking drugs or ice; the latter to answer the&#xD;
constant cry of the sick for "ice, 0 for a little ice !" Nurses&#xD;
could not be had,i and the suffering among the poor was dis-&#xD;
tressing beyond description; whole families were down at&#xD;
once, and unable to answer the call for "ice, 0 for a little&#xD;
ice ." In many instances their dead lay rotting beside them,&#xD;
and none to help. The doctors and the few clergymen that&#xD;
were spared were going day and night; relief associations&#xD;
were formed, and disbanded by death. Over the silent city&#xD;
death held his carnival. The hearses were unable to bear&#xD;
off his victims, and drays and carts were loaded with the&#xD;
dead and sent galloping to, the graveyard, where coffins lay&#xD;

in heaps waiting for interment. Entire families were swept&#xD;
off, and in ~~any cas~s where survivors were left they did not&#xD;
know which of the long rows of little mounds of fresh earth&#xD;
covered the remains of their friends. Frost alone could&#xD;
check the of the terrible epide~nic.&#xD;
Among those who had 'been unable to leave, were Mrs. St.&#xD;
Cloud and family. When the presence of the disease in the&#xD;
city was authoritatively announced, it was discovered that&#xD;
two of her servants were prostrate with i~; and she would&#xD;
not leave them, and Alice refused to leave her. Col. Clark-&#xD;
son sent word to Agnes to meet him at the house of a friend,&#xD;
a few miles i~i the country, where she could spend the balance&#xD;
of the season out of reach of the epidemic. Agnes made&#xD;
every effort to induce Alice to accompany her, but in vain.&#xD;
Vaughan generously offered, if Mrs. St. Cloud would leave,&#xD;
and take Alice with her, to stay and take charge of the~ sick&#xD;
servants, and see that they had all needful medical attention&#xD;
and nursing; but, like the true mistress and noble woman&#xD;
that she was, she said no; that the negroes had served her&#xD;
faithfully wh~n in health, and she would not abandon them&#xD;
in sickness, but would stay and nurse ~them through.&#xD;
The parting between Alice and Agnes was affectiiig. When&#xD;
it was evident that they had to part-~-part and place a disease&#xD;
that was no respecter of' persons, that spared neither age nor&#xD;
sex, beauty nor purity, between them-.--neither could speak.&#xD;
The trufiks were packed' in silence, tears dripping as they&#xD;
walked about the room. When all was ready, and the car-&#xD;
riage waiting at the gate, the two walked together in the&#xD;
little oratory, and kneeled before the family altar and prayed&#xD;
for strength, resignation, and hope'. Agnes arose, pressed a&#xD;
kiss upon Alice's forehead, turned, and left her kneeling;&#xD;
left her in the hands of her God and, guardian angel, and,&#xD;
seating herself in the old family carriage, it rumbled away&#xD;
over the pavement, and up the steep hills, where she cast a&#xD;

C&#xD;
&#xD;
last fond look behind, as tbe heart closed upon scenes dear&#xD;
as the memories of childhood.&#xD;
A promise had been extracted from Alice by Agnes, that&#xD;
if Alice should be attacked with the fever, she would send&#xD;
for her. From day to day, from week to week, reports were&#xD;
borne to her of the progress of th~ disease. To-day some&#xD;
loved schoolmate, and to-morrow anotherjlad gone; to-day&#xD;
some kind old man, upon whose knee she had sat in child-&#xD;
hood; to-morrow some affectionate old lady who had warned&#xD;
and guided her wayward footsteps, had gone; but Mrs. St.&#xD;
Cloud, the kind nurse, and Alice, the ministering angel,&#xD;
were safe and well. The season had far advanced, and the&#xD;
weather had become cool, and frost reported in the low, moist&#xD;
places, and death's carnival almost over; and Agnes began&#xD;
to breathe freer and easier, when, late at night, the clatter&#xD;
of a horse's hoof, in full gallop, and the loud "llalloo," as it&#xD;
stopped at the gate, aroused the household. Col. Clarkson&#xD;
jumped up and inquired:&#xD;
"Who 's there ?"&#xD;
"It's Simon,~ sir. Miss Alice mighty sick, and Missus&#xD;
told me to come tell Mis~ Agnes. She was took day 'fore&#xD;
yesterday; and Doctor say she 's mighty sick."&#xD;
It was a severe trial to the anxious and fond parents; but&#xD;
they had not the heart to refuse the call of friendship from&#xD;
the early friend and companion of the idol daughter; and&#xD;
the horses were hastily harnessed, and the carriage brought&#xD;
out; and ere day Agnes was seated by the bedside of her&#xD;
'friend, bathing her hot temples, and answering~ the ever-con-&#xD;
stant cry, "Ice I 0 for a little ice I"&#xD;
lit was soon noised over town that Alice St. Cloud was&#xD;
siek-sick unto death; and, though money could not buy&#xD;
help, 'the old and the young, the rich and the poor, the sick&#xD;
and the well, came to offer their services. Death's hand was&#xD;
upon the dear girl; but he djd his work slowly, as if loth to.&#xD;

destroy so much beauty. She lay patient and uncomplaining&#xD;
as a lamb. How soothing to the dying girl wa~ the memory&#xD;
of the "God bless you" of the grateful poor to whose lips&#xD;
she had held the cooling ice, in answer to the call, "Ice 1 0&#xD;
for a little ice I" Death had thrown his scythe broadcast&#xD;
over the city, but had reserved this beautiful sheaf for the&#xD;
last. All the day and night before her death crowds were&#xD;
coming and going on tiptoe through the house and yard.&#xD;
When the sad hour came, in a low, almost inarticulate voice,&#xD;
she said, "Dear Agnes, kiss me ;~' and the gentle spirit of&#xD;
the lovely and loved Alice St. Cloud bore the kiss to heaven.&#xD;
Site was dead. There was no wail there; there were no&#xD;
tears' there; but there was grieg pure, perfect, and all-per-&#xD;
vading~ 0, how heavy fell the stroke upon that mother!&#xD;
It bore to the dust her brave heart. And Vaughan, poor&#xD;
man! The star of his life went out in midday. And dear&#xD;
Agnes! who sat like a marble ~tatue by the bed of death!&#xD;
The dead was as beautiful as in life. Death had the power&#xD;
to slay, but not to mar. r~hat pale, white face was as beau-&#xD;
tiful ~is in life. hundreds came to look at it; and the pious&#xD;
clipped a lock of the long raven hair, and braided it with&#xD;
their relics; and many left their own dead to follow her re-&#xD;
mains to the grave. A quiet spot in a retired part of the&#xD;
graveyard was chosen for her last resting-place, where&#xD;
have fltted a slab of the granite so gray;&#xD;
And sweet Alice lies under the stone."&#xD;
And thither each day at sunrise, whether hot or cold, wet or&#xD;
dry, Mrs. St. Cloud went and sat, and sighed the weary hours&#xD;
away, without a tear to relieve her overcharged heart. The&#xD;
enclosure around the grave was neat and simple, and flower-&#xD;
a vases were placed there, which she kept filled with fresh&#xD;
flowers, from the shrubs of Alice's own planting. Each&#xD;
night some unseen hand placed upon the slab a bouquet of the&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR A1~1USEMENT.               199&#xD;
rarest and richest flowers, displa~eing the one of the day&#xD;
before. She never inquired, but her heart told her Who it&#xD;
was that thus nightly offered th'is incense of flowers to the&#xD;
shade of the departed Alice. Frank Vaughan, the once&#xD;
volatile trifler, it was, who thus laid his offering of love upon&#xD;
the tomb of the dead of his heart.&#xD;
When the epidemic subsided, and the citi~ ens returned,&#xD;
they did not recognize in the pale, worn, gray-haired woman,&#xD;
with face furrowed with premature wrinkles, the splendid-&#xD;
looking lady and friend they had parted with only six or eight&#xD;
weeks previous. The places of those who were taken by the&#xD;
fever from the business mart were soon refilled, and the tide of&#xD;
commerce rushed over the sad wreck which had been made&#xD;
in the city, like the waves over the gallant vessel and crew&#xD;
that sink beneath them. But the thoughtful needed not to&#xD;
count the little hillocks and gravestones that stood thick in&#xD;
the graveyard, to learn the ravages of the disease. He had&#xD;
but to look upon that grief-worn face: it told even the care-&#xD;
tess looker what death had done. hundreds of heartlistones&#xD;
had been made desolate, hundreds of children nioth~rless,&#xD;
and mother's childless. But death was not content to leave&#xD;
the graveyard, the true index of his doings, to tell the in-&#xD;
quirer of his triumphs; but, revelling in his success, he in-&#xD;
scribed it upon that living monument of grief in characters&#xD;
so broad, and lines so deep, as to force it upon the attention&#xD;
of the buyers and sellers in Gotham, and those who dealt in&#xD;
"purple and fine linen."&#xD;
When in fall health, Alice, un er a presentiment that she&#xD;
would die before ner friend, extra~teci a promise from Agnes&#xD;
that if such should be the case she would join in chanting a&#xD;
requiem at her funeral. The rage of the epidemic was such,&#xD;
and so quick did its victims suece~d each other, that it was&#xD;
impossible fo~ the service which the Church has appointed&#xD;

}f'or the dead to be recited at the time of interment, and, at&#xD;
e request of Mrs. St. Cloud, this service was performed for&#xD;
her daughter as so6n' after the disappearance of the fever as&#xD;
the services of a clergyman could be procured. Agnes re-&#xD;
membered her promise, and nerved herself to the sadly pleas-&#xD;
ing task of fulfilling it. An immense crowd of mourners&#xD;
gathered {o witness and take part in the solemn ceremony.&#xD;
The church and altar were draped in mourning, and all wore&#xD;
a grandly solemn aspect. As ,the grief-stricken mother&#xD;
walked slowly in, leaning upon the arm of Mrs. Clarkson,&#xD;
dressed in deepest mourning, stopped and entered her pew,&#xD;
and kneeled in silent prayer to God-the God of the widow---&#xD;
hearVs that never prayed before, prayed then for her.&#xD;
The drapery of the church, the solemnity of the occasion,&#xD;
the impressive nature of the servWe, combined to make all&#xD;
feel that God, and the dead, and a great grief were there.&#xD;
When the full choir sounded the re~juiem, and one voice and&#xD;
another dropped off, until a solitary fem~ic voice, sustained&#xD;
by the low, deep tones of the organs was left trembling upon&#xD;
the finer notes, and thrilling upward, upward, upward, until&#xD;
the vast nave and dome were fille~, and the audience bap-&#xD;
tized in harmony, and the soft, round, sweet, clear note&#xD;
stretched away to heaven, and melted and died like the note&#xD;
of the swan, the vast audience involuntarily bent the knee&#xD;
and let the tears of sympathy drop without restraint. The&#xD;
tribute thus paid to the impassioned young virgin of earth as&#xD;
she chanted to her sister virgin in heaven was as affecting as&#xD;
it was priceless. At the conclusion, Agnes was borne ex-&#xD;
hausted from the church. She had fulfilled her promise, but&#xD;
the trial had overtaxed her strength, and a severe attack of&#xD;
~brain fever succeeded.&#xD;
In her delirium, she would talk to and of Alice, strangely&#xD;
confusing her name at times with that of Robert hamilton.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. St. Cloud was kept ignorant of her illness, as her know-&#xD;
ledge of the suffering of Agnes would only have distressed&#xD;
her, without relieving the sick.&#xD;
Such was the grief of the bereaved in other that she took&#xD;
no note of time, nor of any other change of nature. Her&#xD;
motions were all mechanical: she rose at a certain hour and&#xD;
took her toast and coffee, and visited the grave, where she&#xD;
remained until sunset, and returned as she went. This was&#xD;
done without reference to the season or the weather.&#xD;
Agnes's constitution was a solid one, and it soon mastered&#xD;
the disease. Upon her recovery, her heart felt a void-the&#xD;
void which the loss of her friend had made; and her thoughts&#xD;
and aching heart naturally turned to Robert Ihamilton, who&#xD;
was then soon expected home. She loved' her parents with&#xD;
all a daughter's true devotion; and she reverenced Mrs. St.&#xD;
Cloud and the Hermit, and Frank Vaughan held a high place&#xD;
in her esteem; but they could not fill the unsatisfied void.&#xD;
Robert could. He had filled the place once, and he could do&#xD;
it again. T hinkiiig of him thus, by degrees his almost for-&#xD;
gotten image came back to reii~ssert its empire over her heart.&#xD;
She wondered how she could have forgotten him so long, and if&#xD;
he in return had forgotten her. The pain which the thought&#xD;
of the possibility of his having forgotten Ii er in love for another&#xD;
caused her, told her how dear lie was, and how necessary his&#xD;
love was to her happiness. Four years and a half had passed&#xD;
since she had seen him, aiid four since she had received any&#xD;
direct news from him, and it would be six or eio-ht months&#xD;
more before she would see him. Had he thought of her&#xD;
through all this silence? Would he care for her when he&#xD;
came home? Would he be changed ~n mind as well- as in&#xD;
personal appearance? Would the m6ral beauty f4~~ which&#xD;
she had so loved him be inarrej? These and many such&#xD;
questions she would ask herself:, but they were questions&#xD;

which the future could alone answer, and what answer it&#xD;
would give was far from being a matter of indifference to her,&#xD;
though her resolute nature would not suffer her to pine and&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
WHILE Agnes was thus interroo'atino' herself and gi&#xD;
expression tQ her fears and anxieties and re~nthroning I&#xD;
ert in her affections, he was earnestly pursuing his stu&#xD;
He had been a hard student, and a successful one, th&#xD;
the college record did not say so. lie had not taken the&#xD;
honors of his class at any one of the examinations, th&#xD;
both teachers and classmates recognized him as decided~&#xD;
best scholar in his class. He never studied a lesson-&#xD;
studied authors, and mastered them. In his classical co&#xD;
he never studied lessons, but strove to learn the langu&#xD;
and did it; in mathematics he never studied a lesson,&#xD;
the science, and learned it. While others were learning&#xD;
sons to recite to teachers, he was learning a science or ma&#xD;
ing a language. They learned something that they m&#xD;
talk qf in after life and forget; he learned something to&#xD;
and to use. Hence the lesson-learners, the glib conners-&#xD;
of phrases made a better and readier ~how at examinat&#xD;
and commencement seasons than he; but they felt am&#xD;
knew that in valuable, substantial learning he was v~&#xD;
their superior. As he did not study for show, nor the&#xD;
of first prizes, but to acquire matter for after life-mat&#xD;
to make himself a man-he was conte~i t that others sh&#xD;
carry off the college palm, so he attain 4d his own solid ei&#xD;

&#xD;
brag of in after life, secured for him not only the esteem arid&#xD;
confidence of his teachers, but also that of the people of the&#xD;
town in which the college was located. All the better class&#xD;
Qf the people sought his acquaintance, and shop-keepers were&#xD;
anxious to get his name upon Their ledgers. This he prudently&#xD;
avoided-buying only what he needed, and paying for what&#xD;
lie bought; and when he was unable to pay the cash, he would&#xD;
not buy, let the desire be what it might. Among his school&#xD;
companions was young James Blunt, son of our old acquaint-&#xD;
ance Mr. Blunt. James had been raised to idleness, and to&#xD;
expect the indulgence and gratification of all his desires and&#xD;
worthless fancies. An indulgent aunt and a club-going&#xD;
father had suffered him to grow up without any particular&#xD;
object in view other than to dress and to create a sensation in&#xD;
society. 119 was inordinately attached to dress, and was a&#xD;
good dancer-the best in the college. His instincts were&#xD;
those of the animal man, rather than of the moral and intel-&#xD;
lectual. The adornment of his person and the gratification&#xD;
of his pleasures were o4,iects in life with him-ends to be at-&#xD;
tained. He had not been taught to do or to learn for the&#xD;
sake of the thing done or learned, but for his own sake-as a&#xD;
success to himself. He dressed not because the occasion&#xD;
required it, but that James Blunt might look well; he learned&#xD;
the courtesies of life not that he might contribute to social&#xD;
entertainment, or help to make others feel at ease, but that&#xD;
James Blunt might cut a figure in society; he went to col-&#xD;
lege not that he might become learned and useful, but that&#xD;
James Blunt might, like other fashionable young men of his&#xD;
acquaintance, have it to say that he had been to college.&#xD;
Thus, James Blunt was the object and aim of James Blunt;&#xD;
and, in all tl~is, he was by no means an exception among the&#xD;
regiment of his companions at home. His was rather the&#xD;
rule, and Robert's course of life the, exception. James was&#xD;
traightdimbed young man, with small hand and foot, to&#xD;

U1&#xD;
&#xD;

hich his aunt often pointed as a mark of his aristocracy,&#xD;
r ther than of a sickly childhood; his head was as small as&#xD;
I is hands and feet, and he took equal care of each; he wore&#xD;
t ic neatest-fitting boot, the nicest gloves, and the smoothest&#xD;
h t-the latter he wore on the side of his head-his hair&#xD;
ai d white pocket-handkerchief being always well perfumed.&#xD;
He was slender, and, but for a certain air of insignificance,&#xD;
would have been rather handsome. With his wants gratified,&#xD;
lie was an inoffensive, idle, pleasure-loving, foppish young&#xD;
man, likely to be ei~tirely worthless as a member of society.&#xD;
His wants, however, were of a kind a full purse could supply,&#xD;
but a full purse was not always at his command. When his&#xD;
father had a good run of luck, and won large stak e~, James&#xD;
was abundantly supplied;, but when a rainy day came-and&#xD;
men who bet to count the game have rainy days as well as&#xD;
farmers-James was neglected, and his clothes at such tines&#xD;
would often become so worn as to give him the appearance&#xD;
of the shabby-genteel, to his great mortification. . Towards&#xD;
the close of Robert Hamilton's last year in college, there&#xD;
came one of these rainy spells upon Blunt. Talk as fast as&#xD;
he might, but as high as he might, and sWear as loud and&#xD;
profanely as he might at his cards and the luck, the count&#xD;
was against him. Jellies was of course neglected. He wrote&#xD;
letter after letter for means to refurnish his wardrobe, but it&#xD;
did not conic. His college bills were unpaid, but he did not&#xD;
think of them, they djd not mortify him, and he did not&#xD;
write for mon ~y to pay the~~. The shop-keeper's~, the tailor's,&#xD;
and the shoen~ aker's bills were all unpaid, and had been sent&#xD;
to his father ihore than once for payment and returned, but&#xD;
he did not ask for money to pay them. These were all matters&#xD;
that did not concern him; the bill-holders were not James&#xD;
Blunt, and James Blunt was the individual he was sent into&#xD;
the world to take care of. He was willing that those bills&#xD;
should be paid, but never bestowed a thought upon them,&#xD;

&#xD;
nor lost a minute's sleep on their account. If his father had&#xD;
paid them, and he had been supplied with means to meet his&#xD;
wants, and he had given himself the trouble to think of it,&#xD;
he would have been rather pleased than otherwise. The&#xD;
money, however, did not c6n~e, either to refurnish his ward-&#xD;
robe or to pay the bills; and his clothes had become so worn&#xD;
and threadbare that he had not a decent suit left, and had to&#xD;
borrow one of a college-mate when he accepted any of the&#xD;
invitations to attend the dancing-parties of town. His pants&#xD;
had all been darned, and his coats were out at the elbows.&#xD;
About that time a new clothing establishment was opened&#xD;
near the college, and the proprietor was anxious to secure the&#xD;
college custom. He was an acquaintance of young Hamilton,&#xD;
and used every exertion to induce him to visit his establish-&#xD;
ment. Having occasion to make some trifling purchase,&#xD;
Robert visited the stove, accompanied by a number of the&#xD;
young men from the college, among them James Blunt, who&#xD;
had borrowed a blanket overcoat of a schoolfellow for the&#xD;
purpose. The proprietor was extremely polite, and conducted&#xD;
them over his well-filled establishment, displaying his "latest&#xD;
Frencb~ styles" in the most seductive manner. Fe~ or no&#xD;
purchases were made, but an impression had been made upon&#xD;
those fond of dress, which the shopkeeper regarded as an&#xD;
earnest of many future sales. Robert did not bestow a second&#xD;
thought upon what had taken complete hold of the mind and&#xD;
desires , of others, and returned to l~is books with double&#xD;
diligence, to make' up for the time the shopkeeper had forced&#xD;
him to lose in looking at and praising wares that he knew&#xD;
but little of and cared less. The next morning he was as-&#xD;
tounded and mor ified to learn that some one of his party on&#xD;
the evening before had stolen a pair of fine cassimere pants&#xD;
from the store on the evening previous. And, to make ~iat-&#xD;
ters worse, he wa told that the clerk who gave the inform-&#xD;
ation alleged that it was done by a ydung man with a blanket&#xD;
&#xD;
coat He had worn a blanket coat himself, and was not aware&#xD;
that any one else had; hence, it behooved him to use every&#xD;
effort to detect the culprit as the best means of vindicating&#xD;
himself. Upon inquiry, he learned that James Blunt had&#xD;
worn a coat of that description, and called at his room:&#xD;
"James," he began, "I am distressed to learn that after&#xD;
we left the store on last evening it was discovered that some&#xD;
one of our party had stolen a pair of pants; and as we are all&#xD;
more or less implicated-and you and II more particularly,&#xD;
as it is said to have been done by some one wearing a blanket&#xD;
coat-it is a duty we owe to ourselves and all the innocent to&#xD;
expose the thief."&#xD;
"Somebody stole a pair of pants !" he exclaimed with&#xD;
natural surprise and some alarm.&#xD;
"Yes; and you must aid me to discover the culprit. Who&#xD;
else besides you and I wore a blanket coat ?"&#xD;
"IL do not know."&#xD;
"Do you know of any one who has a pair of new pants of&#xD;
the description of those stolen-a pair of fine French cassimere&#xD;
uants ?"&#xD;
"Nobody, except myself. I received a pair very much&#xD;
of that description from home on yesterday."&#xD;
"On yesterday, you say ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"116w did they come&#xD;
"By the Packet."&#xD;
"By the Packet!"&#xD;
"Yes ;" drawing his breath hard and his eyes ready to ~tart&#xD;
from their sockets.&#xD;
"Why, James, James! The Packet did not arrive on&#xD;
yesterday." This was said at a venture, as he did not know&#xD;
whether it had arrived on that day or not.&#xD;
"Great God !" exclaimed James, holding up his hands and&#xD;
looking, wild, "I am ruined !~ IL stole the pants !" He covered&#xD;
&#xD;
I                                        -~&#xD;

his face in his hands and sank in a chair and begged: "0,&#xD;
Robert! save me from exposure I"&#xD;
"If I can I will. If no one clse knows of this, I shall&#xD;
never speak of it. Give me the pants, and I will return&#xD;
them, and answer no questions-not even to vindicate&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
He topk the pants and returned them, and was greatly&#xD;
relieved by the clerk, who witnessed the act, declarino~ that&#xD;
he was not the one who did it. He refused to give the~name&#xD;
of the culprit to the shop-keeper or to the city authorities.&#xD;
News of the theft soon reached the college 'faculty and&#xD;
Robert was summoned before them to give information L~&#xD;
it. The president, who was a very rigid moralist and d scip-&#xD;
linarian, asked to know the facts.&#xD;
"As near as I can give them," said Robert, "the are&#xD;
these : On yesterday evening, after college hours, so' oral&#xD;
young gentlemen and myself visited the new clothing-store&#xD;
on the corner, and while there one of the young men stole a&#xD;
pair of pants. The pants have been recovered and returned&#xD;
to the owner."&#xD;
"Do you know who stole th~ pants ?"&#xD;
"I do."&#xD;
"Who was it ?"&#xD;
"I am unwilling to say; and. I have promised the young&#xD;
man not to expose him."&#xD;
"You must be aware, Mr. Hamilton, that if, knowing of&#xD;
the theft, we retain the thief in the college, it will injure the&#xD;
institution, and we must know who he is, that he may be ex-&#xD;
pelled, and the character of the school vindicated, and an&#xD;
evil companion removed from among the other young men."&#xD;
"I am aware of this, and would not willingly do any thing&#xD;
that the guardians of the institution may think would injure&#xD;
it, and am reluctant to decline doing what they think need-&#xD;
ful for its c~efence; but I have no doubt this is the young&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING    FOR AMUSEMENT.             209&#xD;
man's first step in crime, and I think his imaginary, or per-&#xD;
Imps real wants, and not a bad heart or vicious disposition,&#xD;
led him to it; rand I hope and believe it will be his last; but&#xD;
if he be exposed and publicly disgraced, he will be ruined&#xD;
beyond the hope of reclaim. I can ha~re no part in his dis-&#xD;
grace. You must excuse me."&#xD;
"We cannot excuse you; you must answer. By refusing&#xD;
to expose the offender, you become a party to his crime. If&#xD;
there be error in dealing severely with a case of this nature,&#xD;
the error and the blame ar6 ours, not yours. It is better that&#xD;
the offender be punished; and his fate serve as a warning to&#xD;
the idle and vicious, than that the college be injured, and&#xD;
his companions compromised. The reputation and the morals&#xD;
of the young men here are intrusted to us; it is a sacred&#xD;
trust, and we wish to acquit ourselves of it to the satisfaction&#xD;
of those who have reposed it in us as far as we may, but&#xD;
which we fall far short of doing if we retain as their daily&#xD;
companion and equal a detected thief. It would be alniost&#xD;
criminal for us to do such a thing. If the offence were a&#xD;
venal one, a youthful indiscretion, we would willingly excuse&#xD;
you from testifying; and now we respect, indeed appla~id the&#xD;
kindly feeling which induces you to ask to be excused; but&#xD;
we cannot excuse, you: you must testify."&#xD;
"It is painful for me to refuse obedience to your com-&#xD;
mand. I have now been under your tuition for nearly five years,&#xD;
and have never been before you, for an infraction of college&#xD;
rules, and Ii have labored hard to acquit myself of bhime in&#xD;
both studies and deportment, and regret upon the eve of my&#xD;
last term to find myself opposed to my teachers in a matter&#xD;
of this grave' character; but I must in this, ~s in all I have&#xD;
done since my entrance here, do what my conscience tells me&#xD;
is right."&#xD;
"Sir," said the president, who was impatient of opposition,&#xD;
with decision and emphasis, "you must answer. The repu-&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
station of this institution is deeply involved, and it must and&#xD;
shall be vindicated."&#xD;
"Sir !" and his eye flashed as the faculty had never seen it&#xD;
flash before, "I would not bow the face of the young of-&#xD;
~fender's parents in the dust, and place him beyond i~he pale&#xD;
of reform by publicly denouncing him, for all the institutions&#xD;
of learning in the land."&#xD;
"Do you mean to brave my authority, young man&#xD;
"I do iiot mean to turn informer against my schoolfellow,&#xD;
and violate my pledge to him."&#xD;
"Unless you answer, I shall expel you."&#xD;
"Then all I have to say, sir, is-.-.&#xD;
-' It is excellent&#xD;
To have a giant's strength, but it is tyrannous&#xD;
To use it as a giant.'"&#xD;
"Don't quote poetry at me, young man. You can take&#xD;
until morning to decide whether you will answer or leave the&#xD;
college."&#xD;
"I need no time to consider; my decision is made."&#xD;
"No more ~words; you can retire, sir."&#xD;
Robert adhered to his rQsolution; but, fortunately for him,&#xD;
a knowledge of the name of the offender reached the faculty&#xD;
through .others, and the necessity of his answering was ob-&#xD;
viated. James was expelled, and Robert Hamilton ~publicly&#xD;
admonished, but in a way that the admonition was rather a&#xD;
compliment than a censure.&#xD;
It was poor James's first step in sin, and taken without the&#xD;
mind, to sin, but from the want of moral strength to resist a&#xD;
temptation, which, but for his raising, would have been no&#xD;
temptation at all. I~Iis personal comfort and adornment were&#xD;
objects, ends to be trainedd by him, and the means by which&#xD;
they were to be attained had never been impressed upon&#xD;
him as the primary object. If he had been taught to con-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
I&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
211&#xD;
&#xD;
sider the means to the end as superior in a moral point&#xD;
to the end itself:, the temptation would not have been gre-&#xD;
sented, and he would not have fallen. Much stronger men&#xD;
than James Blunt find it impossible to resist temptation; but&#xD;
all, even the weak, can avoid it. A person may be so raised,&#xD;
and his tastes so cultivated, that temptation will rarely assail&#xD;
him. The man of sober habits is not tempted by the sparkle&#xD;
of the wine-cup, nor the plain man of business by the rattle&#xD;
of the dice-box; but when these things are indulged until&#xD;
they become temptations, they are rarely if ever ~resisted;&#xD;
hence the importance of avoiding the formation of a vicious&#xD;
habit, or one that may tempt to vice. No man sins for the&#xD;
love of sinning, unless he be a very depraved wretch indeed.&#xD;
The thief does not steal for the love of stealing; the miser&#xD;
does not swindle for the love of swindling; the drunkard&#xD;
does fiot drink for the love of drunkenness; these passions,&#xD;
when they become passions, are indulged for some ulterior&#xD;
end. One steals to save hi~n from labor; and one swindles&#xD;
to add ill-gotten gains to his ill-gotten heap; and the other&#xD;
drinks to satisfy his inordinate thirst for strong liquors. These&#xD;
appetites or passions are artificial, and if never created, there&#xD;
would be no temptation to gratify them. James Blunt had&#xD;
an inordinate desire to dress genteelly, and suffering mortifi-&#xD;
cation from his inability to gratify that desire, when 'the&#xD;
means of gratifying it were presented, the temptation was too&#xD;
strong for his imperfect moral training, and he yielded. To&#xD;
another it would have been no temptation at all: it would&#xD;
have been no temptation to Robert Hamilton; it would have&#xD;
been none to the president of the college. What a warning&#xD;
should it not be to parents!&#xD;

ChAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
"And these once learned, what wants the tempter now&#xD;
To snare the stoutest champion of men ?"&#xD;
IT was the desire of Dr. Floyd, and the other friends of&#xD;
Robert at home, that he should visit Washington City after&#xD;
his graduation, and remain there during the session of Con-&#xD;
gress. Letters were accordingly furnished, by means of&#xD;
which he obtained introductions to the leading men of the&#xD;
nation. He eagerly sought the acquaintance of a distin-&#xD;
guished Senator from the West, whose talents and fame had&#xD;
excited his imagination; also that of the President, and others&#xD;
who filled the great offices of state, and who were placed by&#xD;
his young fancy at an immeasurable distance above the great&#xD;
herd of men, and far removed from their follies and vices:&#xD;
He was surprised to find that officers were but men after all-~&#xD;
men who ate and drank and talked and walked like other&#xD;
men, and some of them mere political stop-gaps, men who&#xD;
filled places to keep others out, without any fitness for the&#xD;
places themselves. His hand trembled and voice faltered, as&#xD;
he pm~esentcd his letters of introduction to his beau-ideal of a&#xD;
great man and statesman; but the easy, affable manner of the&#xD;
Senator disembarrassed him, and put him quite at ease.&#xD;
Through Senator - he was introduced to the President&#xD;
and heads of departments, and learned the men and means&#xD;
whereby the machinery of government was moved. It was a&#xD;
relief to observe the republican simplicity of the great bulk&#xD;

of those~to whom the nation had confided the direction of&#xD;
public affairs. lie was almost as much confused and be~&#xD;
wildered, and in as much danger of losing his identity, when&#xD;
invited by the President to dine with him, as was Abou&#xD;
Hassan in the palace of the Caliph Haroun Alraschid. lie&#xD;
could not help but love and venerate the government that&#xD;
made the unpretending, shy, and awkward college student&#xD;
the equal of the President, the~head of the nation. In the&#xD;
evening, the Senator called at his hotel, arid kihdly offered to&#xD;
show him some of the sights to be seen and enjoyed in Wash-&#xD;
ington. After seeing much that was novel and interesting,&#xD;
it was proposed to go to P-'s and get a lunch: every&#xD;
sportsman who has ever visited Washington knows who&#xD;
was. They stopped at the door of a large magnificent.&#xD;
establishment, and pulled the bright silver bell-knob: an old&#xD;
gray-haired negro man, with the manners of a gentleman,&#xD;
answered the call, and recognizing the Senator, gave an in-&#xD;
quiring look at hamilton, to which the Senator answered,'&#xD;
"All right." They were asked in, and the Senator, who&#xD;
seemed perfectly at home, led the way up a flight of stairs to&#xD;
a spacious and splendid saloon, brilliantly lighted with gas,&#xD;
and more richly furnished than the President's mansion. He&#xD;
could scarcely suppress an exclamation of surprise and won-&#xD;
der. The proprietor gave him a warm welcome to the hos-'&#xD;
pitalities of the house, and attentive and polite servants soon:&#xD;
served up for them a lunch as elegant as money could buy, or&#xD;
the appetite of an epicure crave. After lunch, the Senator~&#xD;
excused himself:, and telling Hamilton if he should desire&#xD;
to leave before his return he would find him in No. 8, up-'&#xD;
stairs, where he had engaged to meet some friends, he left&#xD;
Hamilton in the care of the proprietor. Hamilton was in&#xD;
a sort of maze, and was unable ,tq conjecture what sort of a&#xD;
place it was, but he felt assured of its respectability, else&#xD;
the Senator would not himself be so much at ease there, and&#xD;

would not have left him alone. Still there was a pressure&#xD;
about the heart that told him that all was not exactly right.&#xD;
The proprietor, quick to read countenances, noticed Ham-&#xD;
ilton's embarrassment, and said:&#xD;
"You seem debating with yourself as to what sort of a&#xD;
place your friend has introduced you to."&#xD;
Hamilton blushed at being thus understood, but was too&#xD;
honest to affect what was not true, and replied:&#xD;
"You are right~ Im just from college, and a stranger&#xD;
)    7&#xD;
in the city." y  ~.           ) c/~&#xD;
"You are in what the woi4d, and especially the pious, have&#xD;
agreed to call a gambling-hell."&#xD;
The start which Hamilton gave, assured the proprietor that&#xD;
*he was not a frequenter of such places, and he said:&#xD;
"I imagine you are not familiar with the scenes and sports&#xD;
you are likely to meet with here, and my advice to you is to&#xD;
remain so. You are, however, welcome here, and to the hos-&#xD;
pitalities of the place, whether you participate in the games&#xD;
or not. I need not tell you that lunch can be had here from&#xD;
ten o'clock till three, and from eight till twelve. Come&#xD;
whenever you feel disposed; you will never find any but the&#xD;
most respectable men in the land here, a majority of whom&#xD;
are Senators, Congressmen, Judges, and G cnerals. If you&#xD;
will allow me, I will conduct you through the establish-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
Hamilton thought any thing better than standing still, and&#xD;
assented. Upon entering the gambling saloon, he perceived&#xD;
at a glance that the proprietor's boast of the quality of hi~&#xD;
guests was but too true: All the "gambling games" -n-as&#xD;
certain chance games which depend upon the turning or a&#xD;
card or the motion of a wheel, independent of the skill or&#xD;
genius of the player, are called-were in full tide. Hamilton&#xD;
was surprised to see, seated about the tables, Congressmen and&#xD;
Senators who the day before had spoken eloquently upon the&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.                215&#xD;
insufficiency of their per diem. He noticed that they lost&#xD;
hur~dreds upon each turn of a card or the roll of a wheel, with&#xD;
the utmost unconcern. The proprietor enjoyed his surprise,&#xD;
and said, pleasantly:&#xD;
"From the way that old man loses, you think he will need&#xD;
an increase of his per diem, lich? You are right. Per diems&#xD;
have built this house; per diem~ have furnished it; per&#xD;
diems have purchased and stocked the tables and wheels you&#xD;
see here. Like the N. C.s, I am in favor of an increase of&#xD;
per diems."&#xD;
While looking on with an entranced sort of interest, Vhe&#xD;
door-bell rang, and a tall, fine-looking man walked in, with a&#xD;
confident, resolute step. He walked up to one of the banks,&#xD;
and asked:&#xD;
"Any limit to the stake ?"&#xD;
"None," answered the dealer, without looking up. The&#xD;
N. C.s who sat around the bank, betting freely, were too&#xD;
deeply interested i 4 their stakes to notice the interruption.&#xD;
The stranger walked to a light, and taking out a roll of bank-&#xD;
bills, counted them, re-rolled them, and returned and placed&#xD;
them on the "queen of hearts." Shuffle, cut, turn: the&#xD;
"queen of hearts" won. The dealer took up the roll, and&#xD;
counted. The first was a thousand dollar bill; so of the&#xD;
'second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth,&#xD;
tenth, and eleventh! The money was counted out without a&#xD;
word-no noise, except the slip, slip, slip of the bills, as they&#xD;
were counted out. The stranger, without a word to any one,&#xD;
gathered up his winnings, and left the saloon as he had&#xD;
entered. Hamilton could not help feeling that eleven thou-&#xD;
sand dollars of~per. diems were stuffed away in the pockets&#xD;
of the desperate player. He noticed, as the stranger left, that&#xD;
a man, whose face had impressed him unpleasantly, and who&#xD;
had apparently lost his last stake, arose and left also. None&#xD;
of the players seemed to notice it; and, if they did, they&#xD;

&#xD;
thought it natural enough, as he had nothing more to lose.&#xD;
His look and manner, however, excited a suspicion in Hamil-&#xD;
ton's mind, but which the fascination of every thing around&#xD;
soon caused him to forget. The scene-the intense excite-&#xD;
mont of the players, as they watched the number upon which&#xD;
their per diem was staked-the silence with which they 're-&#xD;
ceived back and paid out their per diems or army pay-&#xD;
fascinated him as the eye of the snake does that of the bird.&#xD;
He, however, had moral strength enough left to turn from it&#xD;
and seek the Senator. It was a relief to him to know that&#xD;
these things had no charm for the great statesman who had&#xD;
introduced him there; and, with a cum~iosity fully satisfied,&#xD;
he ~ou~ht No. 8, where he expected to find the Senator en-&#xD;
gaged with a select committee upon the great affairs of state;&#xD;
but what was his surprise to find him and senators from three&#xD;
Southern States seated, with the President of the United&#xD;
States, around a table, playing for amusement, and betting&#xD;
to count a game of poker! an old acquaintance he thought&#xD;
he had left in the Mississippi swamps-the same game at&#xD;
which h~ had seen his uncle and Col. Clarkson play. It had&#xD;
alway~ been a distressing doubt with him whether this poker-&#xD;
playing was not gambling, and he had tried to persuade him-&#xD;
self that it was not; for he loved both his uncle and Col.&#xD;
Clarkson, and from his mother he had inherited a strong re-&#xD;
pugnance to gambling, and could not think that those he&#xD;
loved were blackened with a crime of the sort. In the father&#xD;
of the being he loved with youth's unselfish devotion, by the&#xD;
hght of whose example he had been able to choose virtue&#xD;
rather than vice, in the husband of her who had been to him&#xD;
a second mother, he strove to see nothing but what was pure&#xD;
and good. He had therefore tried to convince himself that&#xD;
playing for amusement and betting to count the game was&#xD;
not gambling, though he had not altog~her succeeded..&#xD;
hence, great as was his disappointment at seeing these&#xD;
&#xD;
distinguished personages and leading officers of State amus-&#xD;
ing them selves at a game of "push-pin" that contrasted&#xD;
unpleasantly with the dignity of their ch~acters and place,&#xD;
he experienced a feeling of relief; for it assured him that it&#xD;
was but "amusement." For had they not avoided the "gam-&#xD;
bling saloons," and all the "gambling games," and sought a&#xD;
relaxation rrom the cares of state in an innocent game of&#xD;
poker? He was somewhat startled to see what a large sum&#xD;
of money it required to count the game. The price of a&#xD;
good "field-hand" changed owners at every deal, and each&#xD;
player seemed better pleased with himself and the cards as&#xD;
his stakes grew larger; but this latter he persuaded himself&#xD;
was simply the pleasure one feels at the success which at..&#xD;
tends his skill, and not the suggestion of greed, the love of'&#xD;
~'amn.&#xD;
* He was asked to join in the game, but declined, not from&#xD;
conscientious scruples, but because of the smallness of his&#xD;
purse, and had the youthful honesty and simplicity to say so.&#xD;
Upon being assured that that need not deter him, as he could&#xD;
"have a sight for his money," he accepted the invitation.&#xD;
Conscience may have smote him as he seated. himself at the&#xD;
table, and drew from his pocket the imperfectly-filled purs~&#xD;
which Agnes had, five years before, made for him; but What&#xD;
were the upbraidings of the Conscience of an inexperienced&#xD;
boy to the matured judgments of the great and good men&#xD;
whom the nation "delighted to honor ?"&#xD;
Like most new players, he held "good hands," and though&#xD;
the betting continued high, he left off winner. The playing&#xD;
did not ce~se until late, and the Senator kindly accompanied&#xD;
him to his hotel.&#xD;
On Th~ir way to the hotel, they stumbled upon 'some one&#xD;
lying on the.~ cement, apparently drunk ~ but by the light&#xD;
of a ~distant ig -lamp, they saw that he was stained with&#xD;
bloods Watchmen were called, and lights brought, when&#xD;

the body was discovered to be stark and stiff. The man bad&#xD;
been assassinated. The knife that did the deed entered be-&#xD;
tween the neck ar&amp;amp;1 collar-bone, and had been driven to the&#xD;
heart. Hamilton recognized him as the stranger who had&#xD;
won the large stake at the saloon during the evening, and&#xD;
guessed whose hand held the steel, and why. Upon examina-&#xD;
tion, a purse with a few hundred dollars in it, a fine gold&#xD;
watch, private papers, etc., were found upon his person; but&#xD;
none of the twenty-two thousand dollars he pocketed in the&#xD;
saloon. The things found upon his person were evidently&#xD;
left to create the impression that something else than a desire&#xD;
of plunder had occasioned the deed. He proved to be a&#xD;
Tennesseean, of wealth and standing, but who was fond of&#xD;
sporting.&#xD;
From the mouth of the dull, closed wound through which&#xD;
his soul had found quick passage to the judgment-seat, came&#xD;
a warning voice to Hamilton to shun the path by which the&#xD;
victim of the card-table had come to his untimely and awful&#xD;
end. For a day or two, he was inclined to listen to its warn-&#xD;
ing; but the example of the living was more powerful than&#xD;
the voice of the dead, and as all the more agreeable compan-&#xD;
ionships were to be found in the resorts of vice, he soon fell&#xD;
into the current, and became a frequenter of the saloons and&#xD;
an adept in cards, confining himself scrupulously to the games&#xD;
that were played for "amusement," and shunning all the&#xD;
gambling games.&#xD;
One evening, some young gentlemen, who, like himself,&#xD;
played only for "amusement," who would scorn to play for&#xD;
money, proposed a game called "' brag," which was new to&#xD;
him, but which was just as "a~nusing" and as innocent as&#xD;
poker. He did no~ understand it exactly, but understood&#xD;
that "two bullets and a bragger"-that is, t o~ aces and a&#xD;
jack-were "invincible." He knew the ca s well enough&#xD;
to know that two persons might hold an "invincible" as he&#xD;
&#xD;
understood it. He noticed that the others, when they sat&#xD;
next to the dealer, generally said, "I pass the age ;" and,&#xD;
without knowing what it meant, would always say so himself.&#xD;
The game had progressed for some time with indifferent suc-&#xD;
cess, and he noticed that a young man, for whom he had&#xD;
formed a high regard, was disposed to "run at him." He&#xD;
understood it as in sport, rather than a desire to win his&#xD;
money, and allowed himself to be amuseLat it. He finally&#xD;
had dealt to him "two bullets and a bragger," and, as usual,&#xD;
said, "I pass the age." His friend bet modestly, and Ham-&#xD;
ilton went a few dollars "better." When his friend was&#xD;
about going "better," Hamilton, not wishing to win his&#xD;
money, kindly said to him,&#xD;
"Don't bet, II have an invincible."&#xD;
"Very well; I'll go fifty better anyhow."&#xD;
"You are foolish to do so, for I tell you I have an invin-&#xD;
cible, and of course I won't call you. Take down your money;&#xD;
you will lose it."&#xD;
"Never do you mind my money; bet if you want to."&#xD;
"I tell you again I have an invincible-I'll go five better."&#xD;
"And I'll go two hundred and fifty better; which is all I&#xD;
have."&#xD;
"I beg you not to do it; I tell y~u again I have an in-&#xD;
vincible, and I do not wish to win your money. Take back&#xD;
your money; I am bound to win it."&#xD;
"Do you bet, and never mind me."&#xD;
"Yevy well; I won't let the stake go any higher, and I&#xD;
call you. You see, Ii have two bullets and a bragger."&#xD;
"Yes; but I have the age!"&#xD;
hamilton's lip turned white as he noticed his friend take&#xD;
down the stakes, which had been won upon his own ignorance&#xD;
of the value of his cards. He could not but view it as a&#xD;
grade less than swindling, but was reluctant tQ. think it in&#xD;
keeping with the morals of the card-table, but as peculiar to&#xD;

the man he had mistaken for a gentleman. His only resent~&#xD;
mont was to rise from the table, saying: "I shall always&#xD;
know what 'passing the age' means after this, and with whom&#xD;
to play. Good day, gentlemen."&#xD;

Remorse stings deeper, and relentless conscience&#xD;

* Tun largest portion of Hamilton's patrimony was in i&#xD;
His uncle, who was the guardian of his property as ~&#xD;
of his person, had used some of it to count the gain&#xD;
would have used it all in that way if the surety c&#xD;
guardian's bond had not cautioned him to make a bet~&#xD;
of it, or otherwise he would ask to ~be released from the&#xD;
To avoid an exposure to which such a thing would s&#xD;
him, he had prudently husbanded the balance; and, sup~&#xD;
that Hamilton might desire to use it in the purchase of n&#xD;
in Virginia, sent him the bulk of it in checks, that he&#xD;
thus employ it if he desired. Hamilton had chosen the&#xD;
his profession, and, uncertain as to 14s future location&#xD;
dently determined not to invest his money until better a&#xD;
as to his future home. When he left for home, there&#xD;
exchanged his checks for checks upon Louisville, an~&#xD;

&#xD;
of every thing made him feel very much at home. Men swore&#xD;
the same oaths and took the same large drinks of liquor as&#xD;
before. He had not learned to swear nor to drink, but he&#xD;
had learned to play, and was ready to take a hand.&#xD;
Among the dashy and dissolute young men with whom he&#xD;
had associated in the national capital he acquired an off-hand,&#xD;
confident manner, foreign to himself, but which won for him&#xD;
among the oif-hand, familiar, easy-mannered, loose-moraled&#xD;
men usually met on steamboats, the character of a "boon com-&#xD;
panion," which means a man who talks at random, mocks at&#xD;
morals, and spends his nioney without stint upon every new-&#xD;
fledged acquaintance. At Memphis a number of new passen-&#xD;
gers came on board, and among them Hamilton was delighted&#xD;
to meet a ~entleinan from Bluff City who was well acquainted&#xD;
with all his friends and relatives there. Hamilton did not&#xD;
recollect him, but the perfect history lie gave of everybody&#xD;
and every thing about the Bluffs, and of his uncle and Col.&#xD;
Clarkson and his family, and his assurance, given with a&#xD;
knowing wink, that brought the blood mounting to Hamilton's&#xD;
face, that somebody's "eye" would "mark" his "coming and&#xD;
grow brighter" when he came, placed him upon the footing&#xD;
of a trusted and familiar friend. He introduced himself as&#xD;
Morton, a relative of a family of that name well known to&#xD;
Hamilton as visitors at his uncle's house. Morton had many&#xD;
good jokes to relate of Ni ekols, Blunt, and other sporting&#xD;
men who had been seen by Hamilton in company with his&#xD;
uncle and Clarkson, told of; games they had played together,&#xD;
and described scenes and times which were familiar to Hamil-&#xD;
ton as the playground of his school-days. He described the&#xD;
funeral of Alice St. Cloud and the great grief of her mother,&#xD;
and the settled melancholy of Frank Vaughan. Tired of&#xD;
conversation, they took a seat at the card-table, played, and&#xD;
rose up still better friends. Hamilton was charmed with the&#xD;
easy nonclialant manner his friend received his winnings and&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
bore defeat-..-a decided mark of a gentleman in Hamilton's&#xD;
estimation. He had a well-bred, gentlemanly indifference to&#xD;
money, and was as apt to bet a large stake upon an indifferent&#xD;
hand as upon a good one. While interested in relating some&#xD;
agreeable incident to Hamilton, he would "pass out" upon a&#xD;
very fine hand, or foolishly bet upon a very mean one, and&#xD;
would remark it with a careless toss up of the cards and a&#xD;
continuation of the conversation, which made Hamilton re-&#xD;
prove him half a dozen times for his extreme carelessness.&#xD;
Morton was fond of a glass of brandy, and urged Hamilton to&#xD;
take a glass, and, in spite of his refusal, would always make&#xD;
the barkeeper bring a glass for him, and would insist each&#xD;
time and say: "Why, you don't know what is good, my&#xD;
boy; try it." This patronizing air, and calling him "boy,"&#xD;
made Hamilton feel as if he would never be a man until he&#xD;
could take a drink "like a man." hence, he could withstand&#xD;
the bantering no longer, and drank part of his glass. It of&#xD;
course inflamed his imagination and loosened his tongue, and&#xD;
gave him a better opinion of himself than he had ever had&#xD;
before, and more disposed to play the "gentleman"-.which&#xD;
was to. bet high and recklessly and pay with grace. After&#xD;
drinking once, he was too much of a man to refuse when&#xD;
liquor was again called for; and though he did not drink&#xD;
deep, he very soon lost his balance of mind and swaggered,&#xD;
and bet at random. His companion was not affected by what&#xD;
lie had drunk, for though be talked much, and had run&#xD;
Hamilton upon his temperance and not "knowing what was&#xD;
good," he took care to make his own potations small.&#xD;
The betting grew high and almost furious. The more&#xD;
moderate players withdrew from the game, and stood around&#xD;
and looked on. The interest became so intense that no note&#xD;
was taken of time: the boat stopped and wooded, and glided&#xD;
off down stream without note by the players; passengers&#xD;

&#xD;
would get off, and new ones come Thoard, without observa-&#xD;
tion. Hamilton got the best hands he ever got in his life&#xD;
before, but still he would loss; he bet higher, but still he&#xD;
lost; he doubled the stake,~ in hope luck would turn in his&#xD;
favor, but he still lost. Such desperate playing, and such an&#xD;
amount of money changing hands, absorbed the attention of&#xD;
the entire boat's company, and a universal sympathy was felt&#xD;
f~r the young man who was fast being beggared.&#xD;
Neither of the players appeared to notice a gentleman who&#xD;
had been for some time promenading to and fro past the&#xD;
table, and would stop while the cards were being shuffled and&#xD;
dealt, and scrutinize closely the dealer, and then renew the&#xD;
promenade, casting furtive glance~ at the table as he passed.&#xD;
Whoever it was, evidently suspected foul play upon the part&#xD;
of Hamilton's new friend. This stopping while the cards&#xD;
were being shuffled and dealt, and renewal of the promenade,&#xD;
attracted no observation from either the players or the&#xD;
lookers-on; and the stranger seemed finally to lose all interest&#xD;
in the game, and walked to and fro without appearing to&#xD;
notice further progress. Hamilton had lost more than half&#xD;
his fortune, and was eager to regain it, and was determined&#xD;
to lose all or win back what he had lost. Morton shuffled&#xD;
and dealt; Hamilton had four kings and a queen. It was a&#xD;
splendid hand, and he was determined to risk all upon it,&#xD;
win back his patrimony, and "jump the game. ~' He was&#xD;
afraid his adversary would take the alarm and refuse to bet.&#xD;
He, therefore, bet cautiously at first. Morton bet back at&#xD;
him, and so the betting continued until Hamilton had every&#xD;
cent he could command, and his watch and jewelry, upon the&#xD;
table. The excitement around the table was so intense as to&#xD;
be painful. Hamilton was flushed and breathed hard, his&#xD;
nostrils were distended like those of a high-mettled courser&#xD;

ions to' see the result, with a painful apprehension that the&#xD;
young man was bankrupt, for all suspected the dealer of&#xD;
cheating.&#xD;
"Ii call you," said Hamilton, as he put up his last stake.&#xD;
"What do you do it on?"&#xD;
"Four kings ;" displaying his hand and reaching for the&#xD;
money.&#xD;
"Not so fast," said Morton; "I have four aces !"&#xD;
Hamilton's face turned to marble, and his eyes were fixed&#xD;
in their sockets like those of' a dead man. A murmur of&#xD;
disappointment and sympathy ran through the bystanders;&#xD;
and as Morton said, "The 'money's mine," and was in the&#xD;
act of drawing it to him, some one with a long arm and long&#xD;
bony fingers reached from among the ~rowd, and, clutching&#xD;
the money, said in a voice that electrified both players and&#xD;
lookers-on:&#xD;
"No, sir; the money's mine ~&#xD;
Hamilton started, and, looking up, saw the Hermit, with&#xD;
his gray locks and reproachful face, standing before him.,&#xD;
The defeated and enraged gambler caught at the money, and&#xD;
was in the act of drawing a dagger, when the Hermit took&#xD;
him by the breast, and, looking him firmly in the face, said:&#xD;
"How dare you! How dare you !" and held him as if in a&#xD;
vice. The ~gambler quailed before his fierce look. "You&#xD;
would swindle the young man out of his fortune by stocking&#xD;
the cards, and then stab an old man who would rescue him I"&#xD;
The excitement was immense, and the scene beyond de-&#xD;
scription. The gray locks, the resolution, and the virtuous&#xD;
indignation of the old man, and the terror of the gambler as&#xD;
the old man held him fast, and the excited bystanders, who&#xD;
stood ready to execute upon him any order the Hermit might&#xD;
give, with the astonishment and fortificationon of Hamilton,&#xD;
formed a striking picture. Turning -to Hamilton, the Hermit&#xD;
said:&#xD;

"Here, young man, is your money. Count out your&#xD;
losings, a~d return the balance, if any, to this swindler and&#xD;
would-be cut-throat. And as for you, sir," turning to the&#xD;
gambler, "you leave this boat." He then called the captain&#xD;
and had the gambler put ashore.&#xD;
This done, the Hermit turned to Hamilton, and said in a&#xD;
tone of half authority and half entreaty:&#xD;
"Never play another card, nor drink another dram."&#xD;
"I promise you, as God is my helper and judge, I never&#xD;
will."&#xD;
"Do not swear, sir; especially by that august name."&#xD;
"I did not intend to swear. ii am excited, and used stronger&#xD;
language than I intended. My dear father and friend, you&#xD;
have saved me. I cannot thank you; words will not express&#xD;
my thanks; but believe me, I have drunk my last dram and&#xD;
played my last game of cards."&#xD;
The sincere and earnest look and manner of Hamilton&#xD;
more than his words affected th~ old man, and he turned&#xD;
away with more emotion than he had ever been known to&#xD;
display toward any except Agnes.&#xD;
The boat met with an accident which detained her for&#xD;
some time on the river, and three pr four days elapsed before&#xD;
she arrived at Bluff City. The eilnbarrassi~ient of Robert in&#xD;
the presence of the Hermit soon passed off, and, noticing&#xD;
that the old man was about leaving the boat with the design&#xD;
apparently of returning to ~' the Bend," and divining the&#xD;
cause, he approached him and said:&#xD;
"Ii cannot consent to this; go on to Bluff City; I prefer it.&#xD;
You think your presence, and the recollection of what has&#xD;
passed, will diminish the pleasure bf the reunion with my&#xD;
friends; but you are mistaken; I shall confess all; and your&#xD;
presence will relieve rather than increase my mortification.&#xD;
Besides, the thought that my misconduct had been the means&#xD;
of preventing you and them from seeing each other, and en-&#xD;

joying each other's society, would distress me far more than&#xD;
your presence can, let it rebuke me as much as it may. You&#xD;
must go; I would not for any thing have it otherwise."&#xD;
The Hermit yielded; and the balance of the trip down, the&#xD;
two were like father and son. The gratitude and filial affec-&#xD;
tion of Robert were expressed in a manner that plQased and&#xD;
won the old man; and if his confidence in Ilamiltcn had&#xD;
ever been shaken, it was restored before they landed at the&#xD;
Bluffs.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
"Wilt thou be undone?&#xD;
Resign the towering thought, the vast design,&#xD;
With future glories big? the warrior's wreath,&#xD;
The praise of senates, an applauding world?&#xD;
All for a sigh? all for a soft embrace ?"&#xD;
ROBERT found Agnes all his heart could wish: she satis-&#xD;
fied his ambition and his fancy. She was' ~as beautiful in&#xD;
mind as in person, loving and beloved, and her life was a&#xD;
living personation of trutlS Her delight at seeing the Her-&#xD;
mit was unbounded. ~he would involuntarily walk vip and&#xD;
stand by him, or tak~ her seat near him as he sat in the&#xD;
family circle, ever participating all his wants and wishes. He&#xD;
only remained a day in the city. At parting, he hung around&#xD;
her neck a string of pearls to which was attached a small&#xD;
locket. Opening the locket after he left, she saw a miniature&#xD;
face of most exquisite beauty aiA trust, and a dried rose-&#xD;
leaf. She could only guess the meaning, and held each sa-&#xD;
cre4.&#xD;
The day after the Hermit left, Robert and Agnes visited&#xD;
the' grave of Alice St. Cloud. The sad mother was there.&#xD;
Twelve months had passed, and she still kept watch at the&#xD;
tomb of her child~ Robert and Agnes recited a prayer, and~&#xD;
laid their offering of flowers upon the cold granite, and re-&#xD;
tired.&#xD;

&#xD;
On their way home, Robert gave a full history of his five&#xD;
years' exile, his card-playing, and the scene on the boat.&#xD;
"Excuse me dear Agnes~allow me to call you so-for&#xD;
thus' wearying you with this tedious history of myself. I feel&#xD;
that you are all truth, and we cannot be to each other what I&#xD;
wish us to be without the utmost frankness on my part; and,&#xD;
besides, I could not bear to have you hear of my vices from&#xD;
another. I have nothing extenuated; I have told you all;&#xD;
ey 'have this extent, no farther.~~~&#xD;
"The recital," she replied, "so far from being tiresome,&#xD;
"Then you do not despise me for my vices ?'~&#xD;
been very entertaining to me. It has filled the gap which&#xD;
five years have made in our acquaintance."&#xD;
"No, Robert; though T do not excuse them. I never&#xD;
thought you perfect. My surprise is, not that you strayed&#xD;
from the path of right, but that with such temptations you&#xD;
should not have gone farther; and I am happy, 0, how&#xD;
happy! that my dear old friend, whom I so love and rever-&#xD;
ence, should have been the means of saving you. I say&#xD;
saved, for II have that confidence in you which will not per-&#xD;
mit me to doubt that you will sacredly keep your promise to&#xD;
hinL"&#xD;
"I thank you for your confidence; and next to the happi~&#xD;
ness this assurance gives me, is the consciousness on my own&#xD;
part that it is not misplaced. It would have distressed me&#xD;
more than I could well have expressed, or you willingly be-&#xD;
lieve, to feel that I had or have lost any, even the slightest&#xD;
portion of the confidence of one who is and has been to me&#xD;
more than a ~ist~r-more than all tho world else. Whether&#xD;
sleeping or waking,, whether poring over musty books, or&#xD;
wandering alone in the wild woods, my 1~houghts were of you,&#xD;
and my highest ambition, after pleasing my Maker, was your&#xD;
approbation. Others carried off the college prizes, when&#xD;
teachers and scholars decla~'ed m~ more deserving. I&#xD;

&#xD;
cared not for that; it was not the prize I struggled for; the&#xD;
acquittal of my conscience, and the approval of my early com-&#xD;
panion and best earthly friend, were the prizes for which I&#xD;
toiled and sacrificed, and -not for college 6clat. This is the&#xD;
first time since my return I have had the courage to talk&#xD;
freely to you. I had been guilty of a most pernicious habit,&#xD;
had placed such a mountain of sin between us by yielding to&#xD;
a temptation which twelve months ago would have been no&#xD;
temptation at all, and which had been made so by mere in-&#xD;
dulgence, that II could not, did not dare approach you upon&#xD;
the familiar, easy footing I should otherwise have done. Like&#xD;
a brother, as I have always felt myself, I should at our first&#xD;
meeting have thrown my arms around you, and wept as at&#xD;
our parting; but stained with unforgiven, unconfessed sin,&#xD;
as II was, I could not embrace one so stainless as I knew you&#xD;
to be. I have fully confessed: am I fully forgiven ?"&#xD;
"You are, most freely and fully."&#xD;
"And now, dear Agnes, that I am forgiven, tell me how&#xD;
far have I fallen below your standard ?"&#xD;
"Not a cubit; on the contrary, in all things of which I&#xD;
am capable of judging, you have improved beyond my ex-&#xD;
pectations, and they were high. I do not say this to flatter&#xD;
you, but, as you seem to court and value my good opinion, to&#xD;
let you know how much you have to sustain."&#xD;
"Be it twice its measure, I should reach its last inch."&#xD;
"Bravely said; but you will find it no holiday-task to ex-&#xD;
ecute. I am not ambitious for myself: like Martha's sister, I&#xD;
choose the humble or 'good part'-it best fits a woman; but&#xD;
for you I am ambitious. Have you ever seen the eagle upon&#xD;
its upward wing? I would have the man who has my love&#xD;
and confidence as far above the common vulgar rabble as the&#xD;
eagle is above the unwieldy bird that saps its lazy wings&#xD;
under him."&#xD;
"I am proud to hear you speak so. My ambition, like the&#xD;

&#xD;
eagle, has built high its eyrie, and, if health and frame hold&#xD;
ut, II will reach it; and thither will I bear you, if you will&#xD;
t ust my pinion."&#xD;
"Think not of me. The bird flies highest and fastest&#xD;
ith fulLfledged and unencumbered wing."&#xD;
"But the rock where I would build my eyrie-.to continue&#xD;
t e figure-will be bleak and barren, if you do not share it ~&#xD;
th me; and, while in that proud solitude I might bear the&#xD;
weight of the world's applause, another might possess the&#xD;
heart and hand Ii desire to be all my own. I would have&#xD;
your love, Agnes; I would buy it at any price, or win it at&#xD;
any hazard: without it, I would not give the breath that&#xD;
stains the glass one looks in for all the applause and empty&#xD;
honors of the world."&#xD;
"Care not, Robert, for the world's applause; think not of&#xD;
it; despise it as I do. I love you, with all my heart I love&#xD;
you; but I would be proud of you! You need not fear the&#xD;
loss of my love, so long as you square your lift by virtue's&#xD;
rules. Be true to virtue, and, though you should be over-&#xD;
taken by temptation, and reel like a drunken man, and lip&#xD;
with him in the ditch, I could still love you; but be false to&#xD;
that, and were you as proud and high in the world's esteem&#xD;
as the bloated politician and world-renowned orator, at whose&#xD;
heels the rabble hoot and cast up their hats, and were you,&#xD;
like him, a defamer of God and a scoffer at morals, I would&#xD;
spurn you as I would a reptile from a flower-vase. Fear not&#xD;
the loss of my love, but strive to deserve."&#xD;
"I will, and have! And I thank you that it is unmixed&#xD;
with worldly considerations. If my aspirations do not deceive~&#xD;
me, I shall strive to climb a steep so high in virtue, truth,&#xD;
and worth, that the breath of the multit~ide cannot reach it:&#xD;
a point from which, in a moral spnse, the successful place-&#xD;
Dover's clifl, when 'its high and bending head looks fearfully&#xD;

in the confined deep.' Facere et merere-To do and deserve&#xD;
-was my motto in college; and it often consoled me for the&#xD;
failure to get what II thought were my deserts. The same&#xD;
shall be my motto in life. By assuring me, dear Agnes, that&#xD;
you love me, you have made me happy 'beyond all that the min-&#xD;
strel hath told;' and will you not complete my happiness by&#xD;
giving me your hand, and uniting your destiny with mine ?"&#xD;
"Not now. You do not need my hand: it will but stay&#xD;
you in your path to future worth; and as to our destinies,&#xD;
they are already united, and nothing but vice can disunite&#xD;
them. You ought not, and IL do not wish to marry now.&#xD;
We can love eaoh'other just as well without, and IL prefer it&#xD;
thus. You do not know how dear it is to think of and love&#xD;
you as you are. Let it remain so, and if any thing should&#xD;
chance that would make it proper that our relations to each&#xD;
other should be chaiiged, either from sickness, separation, loss&#xD;
of friends, or any of the thousand contingencies of life, seek&#xD;
me, and ask my hand, and, with my parents' consent, I will&#xD;
go with you to the altar."&#xD;
The look of trust and happiness with which she said this&#xD;
were so naive and touching, as to deter him, ardent as were&#xD;
his feelings at the moment, from persuading her to decide&#xD;
diffei~ently. He walked some steps in thought; then said:&#xD;
"Perhaps you are right. I am not very impulsive nor im-&#xD;
patient, nor am I jealous. I do pot know what it is to be&#xD;
jealous. I also have much to do, and to love and hope with&#xD;
the consciousness of being loved is just as sweet to me as to&#xD;
you. When a child~, I loved my mother, 0 how dearly! and&#xD;
when I lost her, you came in to fill the place in my heart.&#xD;
Others I have esteemed, venerated some; but you two are&#xD;
the only ones I have ever loved, and to me it is enough: I&#xD;
have no occasion to think of or lo~e another; hence you may&#xD;
know how enth~ely my heart and thoughts are yours."&#xD;
"With but few exceptions, my situation is like yours. I&#xD;

.lovcd sweet Alice beyond what I can tell, as I do also the&#xD;
Hermit and Mrs. St. Cloud. I also esteem and sympathize&#xD;
with Mr. Va~ighan. Beyond these and my home-circle, my&#xD;
thoughts and feelings have never gone; and the attentions&#xD;
which society forces upon me are irksome rather than' agree-&#xD;
able."&#xD;
"I am glad it is so: not that II care that others should&#xD;
engage your attention, but because I have the most supreme&#xD;
contempt for most of the great fashionable hive that swarm&#xD;
around you. I owe much to your parents: they have both been&#xD;
kind to me, and your good and true mother has been a second&#xD;
mother to me; and as for the Hermit, Ii have for him a feel-&#xD;
of the highest and strongest reverence- it amounts&#xD;
almost to awe; and with Vaughan and Mrs. St. Cloud I also&#xD;
deeply sympathize. Miss Alice I barely knew: we met as&#xD;
children years ago, and the memory of her comes back like&#xD;
a ray of sunshine. You were fortunate in your school com-&#xD;
panion; much more so than I. We both chanced to meet a&#xD;
iBluff City schoolmate at college, but ~whaV a contrast! You&#xD;
can think of yours, though lost to earth, with pleasure. I&#xD;
can think of mine, alas! only with shame."&#xD;
"Yes, poor James! And I understand he is about marry-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
"Indeed! To whom ?"&#xD;
"To the youngest daughter of Mr. Piper, called Pet, I&#xD;
believe; and I understand she is a very worthy young lady,&#xD;
though somewhat vain and foolish."&#xD;
"Poor girl! What a fate awaits her! Her father ought&#xD;
to interpose and save her."&#xD;
"It is a match of his making, I understand, He is more&#xD;
foolish than his daughter, and has been trying for a long time&#xD;
to get 'into society,' as some weak-minded people call the&#xD;
foppery of the world; and he is distressed to death that a&#xD;

place has not been assigned him in fashion's temple, and his&#xD;
four daughters long since married."&#xD;
"Are the young ladies defi~icnt ?"&#xD;
"Not at all, so far as Ii know. They do not make a very&#xD;
good appearance out, but that, I imagine, is more owing to&#xD;
the fact of their having seen so little of society than to ~ny&#xD;
defects of their own. And Mr. Piper is said to be too penu-&#xD;
rious to make them presentable ~in society, and then frets him-&#xD;
self and them out of all patience beca~ise they are not leaders&#xD;
of ton."&#xD;
"A strange weakness in a parent! It has always seemed&#xD;
to me that nothing could well pain a father'~ heart more than&#xD;
to see his daughter the vain and trifling kader of a v in and&#xD;
trifling throng. I should think a parent would pr for his&#xD;
child to be the flower that opens its petals to the mo ubeam,&#xD;
and closes them in the sunlight, rather than the flami g sun-&#xD;
flower, seeking the broadest sunlight to display its vulgar&#xD;
charms."&#xD;
Very true, but weak people do weak things. All leaders.&#xD;
of fashion must, of necessity, be weak, or they would not&#xD;
seek to lead the giddy train. It charms only those who are&#xD;
incapable of appreciating the higher aims and destiny of&#xD;
woman; and a fictitious estimate, I suppose, is placed upon&#xD;
fashionable society by those who~ by birth, habits, or poverty,&#xD;
are excluded from it; and there are many who, like Mr&#xD;
Piper, regard it as the grand climax of a woman's life."&#xD;
"A most reprehensible weakness, surely. But if stingi-&#xD;
ness is his only fault, his daughters ought not to suffer doubly&#xD;
on that account, both in their social status and wardrobe."&#xD;
"That is enough fo~r fashionable society, but it is not all&#xD;
which Madam Rumor imputes to Mr. Piper in this instance.&#xD;
But I know very little of the family. I have met the young&#xD;
ladies sometimes and tried to approach them, but a sort of&#xD;

mauvaise honte has always kept them at a distance. But,&#xD;
changing the subject-iRobert, you have not told me yet any&#xD;
thing of your travels, or your enjoyments in Washington.&#xD;
You know I saw little of the world while at school, and since&#xD;
my return have not yet received my own consent to travel,&#xD;
much as Ii know II should enjoy it."&#xD;
"I do not know that i[ could interest you much with the&#xD;
sights and wonders I saw in our Capital. Indeed, the plea-&#xD;
sure one receives there is 'more in the association of ideas&#xD;
than in what is really seen or heard. When in the Senate-&#xD;
Chamber, my mind went back to the great and illustrious&#xD;
men whose voices once entranced the crowd of eager listeners&#xD;
~n that immense dome, but who now sleep with their fathers.&#xD;
Clay, Webster, Jackson, and Calhoun-where arc they now?&#xD;
Gone! 'And the places which knew them oi~ce sh~dl know&#xD;
them no more.' There are many bold spirits, many splendid&#xD;
orators and noble statesmen there still, and among them all&#xD;
none take a higher position than our, own honorable Senator.&#xD;
His character, whether in private life, on the field of battle,&#xD;
or in the halls of Congress, is ever the same-the same in-&#xD;
corruptible man-true to his country as the needle is to the&#xD;
north star. Politics, whilst they have natui~ally roused the&#xD;
elements of his clear, thinking mind, and called into action&#xD;
his best talents, have had no power over his moral character,&#xD;
and he towers high above all those vices which are so allur-&#xD;
ing to many of our representatives. ~Were I a politician,&#xD;
Agnes, he should be my inodel.'~&#xD;
By this time they had reached th&amp;amp; more thickly settled&#xD;
part of town, and their conversation was interrupted by the&#xD;
friendly greetings of their acquaintances, who were walking,&#xD;
like themselves, taking advantage of the beautiful evening&#xD;
to exercise in open air. Hamilton and Agnes were in no&#xD;

"Marriage is a matter of more worth&#xD;
Than to be dealt in by attorneyship."&#xD;
SHARSPEARn.&#xD;
'AGNES had heard correctly: James Blunt was engage&#xD;
be married to "Pet." Friend Piper's experiment of&#xD;
band-hunting for his daughters in the swamps of Louis&#xD;
proved a failure, and he frefted more than ever, He w&#xD;
not admit, even to himself, that he was in any manne&#xD;
fault. He had attributed their failure' to get husband&#xD;
every variety of cause, and at last saddled it upon their&#xD;
gion; and it was constantly introduced as a s~ibject of&#xD;
dressing comment to all. He insisted that unless I&#xD;
changed their religion t~iiey would never get married in&#xD;
world; that nobody worth having attended their church,&#xD;
that the respectable families who did attend paid no atten&#xD;
to them; that all the marrying young men attended o&#xD;
churches. Betsy had borne the thing as long as her slei&#xD;
stock of patience could stand it, and put in:&#xD;
"It seems that you were fool enough to marry witi&#xD;
reference to your wife's religion, and all the fools are&#xD;
dead yet."&#xD;
"Nobody will be fool enongli to marry these girls&#xD;
their old - fashioned religion, whether they are all dea&#xD;

man who would refuse me on account of my religion, I would&#xD;
~ot like to marry: I should not be happy with such a man;&#xD;
and, moreover, I do not want to marry."&#xD;
"Don't tell me that, my daughter! don~t tell me that!&#xD;
You do want to marry, and if you don't, I want you to; but&#xD;
I am not likely to have my wants gratified soon. When you&#xD;
go to church they do not notice you, and 'begrudge you the&#xD;
seat you sit on."&#xD;
"If you'd pay for it," croaked in Betsy's voice, "they&#xD;
would n't begrudge it, II reckon. Wh~it do you talk to the&#xD;
girls about their religion for? It never cost you any thing.,&#xD;
How much, did ever you give to the Church? You can say,&#xD;
as the old man did when the preacher congratulate~t every-&#xD;
body upon the cheapness of the gospel, 'Thank the Lord, it&#xD;
never cost me a dime }' and I can say to you, as the preacher&#xD;
said, 'Lord have mercy on your stingy soul!' You've&#xD;
swopped and stopped until there are no more swops left,&#xD;
and now you want to swop off our religion; if you'd swop&#xD;
and get religion, it would be better for you."&#xD;
Pet, seeing the breath thus knocked out of Piper, and&#xD;
anxious for a husband, and indifferent upon the subject of&#xD;
religion, approached her father and said:&#xD;
"Pa, if you will get me some fashionable dresses, I will&#xD;
go wherever you want me, and will attend all the fashionable&#xD;
churches."&#xD;
"I'll do it, my daughter. I am glad I 'ye got one daughter&#xD;
left. You shall have whatever you want, and by the time&#xD;
you are married and settled off and at liberty to attend what&#xD;
church you please, the other girls will wish they had fol-&#xD;
lowed my advice.~~&#xD;
Pet was accordingly rigged out in dresses to her taste,&#xD;
which, unschooled as it was, was none the best. But piqued&#xD;
as Piper was, lie, for the first time in his life, loosed hi~&#xD;
purse-strings, and Pet was richly if not tastily supplied.&#xD;
&#xD;
Thus fitted, she started church-going for a husband. She&#xD;
attended first one and the other, as it was the more fashion-&#xD;
able or popular. When it was thought too common to attend&#xD;
church, or she had nothing new enough to attract attention,&#xD;
she remained at home and read novels. The hunt was kept&#xD;
up for some- time with rather a discouraging prospect, and&#xD;
Piper's pride alone prevented hum from cancelling the bar-&#xD;
gain. At last Pet's flaunting apparel and impertinent man-&#xD;
ners attracted the attention of James Blunt, and, without an&#xD;
introduction, he accompanied her home. Piper was trium-&#xD;
pliant! His plan had succeeded: one of the ton, one of the&#xD;
fashionable, had walked home with Pet, had sat down in his&#xD;
parlor, and promised to call again! It was glory enough for&#xD;
one, day. Pet never would have captivated a young man in&#xD;
the very heart of "society" if she had listened to her mother&#xD;
and older sisters; he always knew he was right; and Betsy&#xD;
and the other girls might be assured if they continued to&#xD;
attend that old- fashioned and unpopular church, the girls&#xD;
would never marry in th~ world. Betsy stood it as long as&#xD;
she could, for she rather thought Piper had the better~ of it,&#xD;
as the Blunts were, "sure enough," in "society ;" but Piper&#xD;
carried his triumph too far, and Betsy let drive at him:&#xD;
"James Blunt! who is he? If she will go out here to the&#xD;
penitentiary, she can catch plenty of beaux just as good,&#xD;
where he would be if he had his dues.",&#xD;
It was like the explosion of a torpedo, and had a stunning&#xD;
effect upon Piper, and if the aim had been less dead, and&#xD;
delayed until Piper's elation was over, it would have knocked&#xD;
James Blunt out of the head of both Piper and Pet. But to&#xD;
explode it in his face in this savage manner in the hour of&#xD;
his triumph, was more than Piper's human nature could stand,&#xD;
and he retorted:&#xD;
"It is a calumny trumped up because you and the girls&#xD;
are jealous of his attentions to Pet. You 'ye picked it up&#xD;

from persons beneath him, who have started it against, him&#xD;
because he refused to notice them."&#xD;
"Well, go ahead. If you want a thief; and a knock-kneed,&#xD;
bandy-shank gumpy, who can set his hat on one side of his&#xD;
cymling head and support a walking-switch, and Pet wants&#xD;
such a husband, I'm sure II don't care.&#xD;
This was too much for Piper, and he congratulated Pet on&#xD;
her success, and left the house.&#xD;
Before his return, he learned that Miss Blunt (an aunt of&#xD;
James) 1~ad made inquiries of him as to th~ name and "quality"&#xD;
of the y~ung lady he had attended from church, and learning&#xD;
that she was a daughter of Mr. Piper, she forbade him, under&#xD;
pain of her displeasure, to cultivate the acquaintance further.&#xD;
This enraged Piper, and he galloped home to communicate it&#xD;
to Betsy, which he did in a fury, and it put Betsy i1~ a fury;&#xD;
but their fury this time was not directed at each o ~her, but&#xD;
directed in a broadside at his aunt. Betsy's ire had abated&#xD;
during Piper's absence, and she was a little alarmed at the&#xD;
possible consequences of her severity. She was apprehen-&#xD;
sive that she had taken a step which might drive Piper and&#xD;
Pet to do a very foolish and ruinous thing. The idea of&#xD;
James Blunt becoming a memberr of the family, with so dis-&#xD;
graceful a report unexplained against him, alarmed her, and,&#xD;
to avert it, she had determined as soon as Piper returned to&#xD;
remonstrate more rationally with him. Piper also rode about&#xD;
on the stool of repentance, and Betsy's picture of James Blunt&#xD;
haunted him, and he had about made up his mind that Pet&#xD;
could put a feather in her cap by rejecting young Blunt.&#xD;
The news of Miss Blunt's opposition changed entirely the&#xD;
current of his thoughts, and its effect was the same upon&#xD;
Betsy. Her pride was cut, and, in her resentment of the&#xD;
affront offered her by the aunt, she forgot the moral and&#xD;
personal defects of the nephew, and determined, in revenge&#xD;
for the wrong, to ei~csurage the attentions of James to her&#xD;
&#xD;
daughter. lie was used to setting at naught his aunt's com-&#xD;
mands-his father never gave any, except in a pet.-.--and took&#xD;
cvery~ opportunity to extend his acquaintance with Pet. The&#xD;
more his aunt scolded, the greater was his determination to&#xD;
prosecute his suit. Although Betsy often ridiculed the young&#xD;
man until Pet was thoroughly ashamed of her choice, she&#xD;
never again alluded to the cause of his college expulsion.&#xD;
James soon proposed to Pet, and was accepted. He did not&#xD;
think jt worth while speaking to Piper on-the subject, which&#xD;
threatened to defeat all Piper's well-conned speech, which he&#xD;
had kept cut and dried for such an occasion, since the return&#xD;
of his daughters from school, som~ five years or more. The&#xD;
occasion for delivering it might never come again, as Pet's&#xD;
success thus far had had no effect upon "the girls," and they&#xD;
continued as before to attend the same old-fashioned church.&#xD;
* lie was determined to take advantage of the present oppor-&#xD;
tunity, and hot to trust to the remote chances ~f either of the&#xD;
other three "girls" getting married, to deliver himself; so&#xD;
he concluded as James would not speak to him, he could at&#xD;
least speak to Jame4 An opportunity was not long in pre-&#xD;
senting itself. Gilpin was galloping glibly along, when Piper&#xD;
noticed James crossing the street, and called to him:&#xD;
"llalloo, James-~ah-Mr. Blunt. How are you ?"&#xD;
"Good morning, Mr. Piper ;" and stopped and looked at&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Needn't stop-nothing particular to say-I can walk&#xD;
along and lead my horse." He dismounted, and putting the&#xD;
bridle over his arm, walked along near the pavement. James&#xD;
Was indifferent, and Piper was frisky. Now that he had&#xD;
made the occasion, and his auditor was before him, and his&#xD;
speech well committed, he was at a loss to know how to be-&#xD;
gin. He would clear his throat, and edge along up to James&#xD;
in a knowing, confidential sort of way, intended to be as&#xD;
father-in-law-ish as he knew how to make it; but James&#xD;

&#xD;
either did not or would not understand him, and neither by&#xD;
word nor manner would he give occasion for the speech.&#xD;
They were approaching the business part of the town, and&#xD;
Piper seeing that a beginning had to be made or the oppor-&#xD;
tunity would slip by, squared himself before James, and with&#xD;
a patronizing smile on his face, said:&#xD;
"James, my daughter has just mentioned to me your wish&#xD;
to~a-you-r-to-a~your wish-a-you-r-to marry my&#xD;
daughter. Girls I suppose must marry, but her request was&#xD;
so sudden-Il do not know how we can spare her; it will not&#xD;
be home without her. She is the centre of our love-bound&#xD;
circle. 11cr "&#xD;
"Hold on there, Bill," said James, calling to a young idle&#xD;
companion of his, passing on the opposite side of the street;&#xD;
"I hold you bound for that treat. Come, Mr. Piper, wont&#xD;
you join me in a glass at Bill's expense? He owes me a&#xD;
treat." Saying which he took Bill's arm, who had crossed&#xD;
the street to him, and went laughing off.&#xD;
Piper was bursting with rage, and would have kicked his&#xD;
prospective son-in-law, but for the fear of thereby overturning&#xD;
his husband-built castle. He could easily have chosen a son-&#xD;
in-law he liked better, but barring the man, h~ regarded the&#xD;
match ~s a step up in life-au introduction of himself:, Bet-&#xD;
sy, and "the girls" into society, and the sure means of mar-&#xD;
rying off his other daughters. This thought saved James&#xD;
from a sound thrashing for his rudeness-a worse one than&#xD;
his weak-minded, fashion.worshipping aunt ever gave him.&#xD;
Such a contingency never occurred to him as he thanked his&#xD;
companion for coming along so opportunely, and saving him&#xD;
from a "great bore."&#xD;
Piper made what he considered great preparations for the&#xD;
wedding, and issued a large number of tickets of invitation.&#xD;
The house was a jam, the supper poor, and the music her-&#xD;
rible, but what cared he for this? for was he not "in so-&#xD;
&#xD;
ciety ?" or, rather, was not "society," or the people he called&#xD;
"society," in his house?&#xD;
Miss Blunt, when the probabilities of the wedding Were&#xD;
first mentioned to her, made quite a fume about it, but, when&#xD;
she saw it was inevitable, yielded, and, for fear of having her&#xD;
sort lost to "society," used all her efforts to have as much of&#xD;
"society" attend the wedding as she could influence. When&#xD;
Piper saw all the fine folks and fine feathers in his house, he&#xD;
congratulated himself again and again upon his forbearance&#xD;
in not stamping his son-in-law in the street for cutting short&#xD;
the speech from which he had just brushed the dust of five&#xD;
years. Betsy, however, was not so well satisfied. She had&#xD;
gained her end-had shown Miss Blunt that her child was&#xD;
equal to hers-but now that it was over, her conscience was&#xD;
not easy; she questioned if she had not paid more for the&#xD;
triumph than it was worth. She had given her child to a&#xD;
man who, whatever might be her virtues or her faults, was&#xD;
incapable of appreciating the one, or of properly correcting&#xD;
the other. Piper had sacrificed his daughter to his ambition&#xD;
for social station; she to gratify her revenge. So, altogether~,&#xD;
Betsy Went to bed with a heavy heart that night.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVIII.&#xD;
"Perseverance is a Roman virtue&#xD;
That wins each godlike act, and plucks success&#xD;
E'eu from the spear-proof crest of rugged danger."&#xD;
LIKE all young professional men, Robert Hamilton had to&#xD;
sit many a long day through, waiting for clients that would&#xD;
not come; but, unlike many, he did not go out to the grog-&#xD;
shops and other disreputable places of public resort to find&#xD;
them. He fortunately had the patience and the means to&#xD;
wait, and employed his time in perfecting himself in his pro-&#xD;
fession; and his old motto, Fctcere e~ merere, came to help&#xD;
relieve the tedious hours of study.&#xD;
lit has been the curse of American genius that the pride&#xD;
and ambition of parents. have undertaken too often to force&#xD;
it into uncongenial and dist~isteful channels. There are no&#xD;
privileged classes, and the professions of law and physic con-&#xD;
stitute, as far as republicanism and the desire of office which&#xD;
pervades all classes will permit, the aristocracy of the coun-&#xD;
try. Hence, those who are able to give their children a&#xD;
liberal education, force them from pride into one or other of&#xD;
these professions, and in this way they are made objects of&#xD;
ambition with all classes. Fathers therefore often choose for&#xD;
the child with reference only to his own wish, and without&#xD;
regard to the fitness of his son forth profession, or the pro-&#xD;
fession for the child; in which case it is merb chance if the&#xD;
&#xD;
244&#xD;
&#xD;
whole thing does not prove a lamentable failure. The pro-&#xD;
fession~ are of course overrun, and confer neither profit nor&#xD;
honor upon any save the very skilful and experienced, or&#xD;
the intriguing and unscrupulous. A select few only can rise&#xD;
to distinction, and the odds are so great in favor of obscurity,&#xD;
that fathers should be reluctant to have their sons enter the&#xD;
list. They should also understand that the most helpless of&#xD;
all the human species is a young collegiate with his parch-&#xD;
ment in his portmanteau, and nothing in his pocket, an&amp;amp; no-&#xD;
thing to do that will put any thing there. He can turn his&#xD;
hand to nothing to supply even his commonest wants. Well&#xD;
may such an one, if he has any pride of character, curse the&#xD;
pride of the parent whose over-fond partiality made him a&#xD;
professional man rather than have him taught some of the&#xD;
plainer and more practical employment of life, which, though&#xD;
less imposing, and less "honorable" in the estimation of a&#xD;
false-judging world, are far surer roads to wealth and an&#xD;
honorable independence. In the latter event, instead of&#xD;
shunning the curious and compassionating eye of his acquaint-&#xD;
ances, he would have moved among his fellows with the proud&#xD;
consciousness of a self-sustaining man. Parents who have&#xD;
never tried it, think a book and an ink-horn a second&#xD;
Aladdin's lamp; but the victim of their misjudging pride too&#xD;
often sits from day to day, from week to week, and month to ~&#xD;
month, and, as often happens, from year to year, without any&#xD;
thing to do, until his patience and substance are both ex-&#xD;
hausted, and, to blunt the edge of mortification, he seeks the&#xD;
bowl or the dissipation of the gambling-room, and is ruined.&#xD;
Formerly there was more excuse for this parental pride and&#xD;
folly than now, for one might well enough be reluctant to en-&#xD;
gage in mechanical pursuits where muscle alone could win.&#xD;
But this is not the case now; the field of enterprise in the&#xD;
mechanic arts is much enlarged by recent improvements and&#xD;
discoveries, and offers as full a reward to talent as to muscle.&#xD;

246      PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
The mental may successfully dispute the goal with the phy-&#xD;
sical.&#xD;
And here it may not be improper to suggest, that these&#xD;
improvements and changes in the mechanic arts advise a&#xD;
change in~ the edUcation of -youth, and an abolition of much&#xD;
of the old useless college routine. Of what use is Latin,&#xD;
Greek, and Hebrew, or any other obsolete language, to the&#xD;
millions who waste time in their acquisition? How many of&#xD;
all those who have travellQd the whole curriculum of a college&#xD;
course ever put their knowledge of these languages to any&#xD;
practical use? Not one in a thousand. The good plain&#xD;
common sense of the country is at war with it; so much so,&#xD;
that if a man attempts to make a display of his accomplish-&#xD;
ments in this particular, he s laughed at for his pains. There&#xD;
were, perhaps, good reasons for the original introduction of&#xD;
this system of education, b t the reasons have ceased, and,&#xD;
according to a universally received maxim of the common&#xD;
law, the reason ceasing, the ule itself should cease. In the&#xD;
early history of jurisprude ce, as a badge of English ser-&#xD;
vittide, the laws were in La in, and no one could be a prac-&#xD;
ticing lawyer without thoroughly understanding that language.&#xD;
Such, however, is not now the case. The study of the Greek&#xD;
and Hebrew~was made necessary for a different, but equally&#xD;
good reason. The Scriptures were written in those languages,&#xD;
and, for several years after the decline of letters on the con-&#xD;
tinent of Europe, the clergy absorbed all the learning of the&#xD;
times, or mainly so. Books were scarce, even loi~g after the&#xD;
discovery of the art of printing; and to be a good theologiai~,&#xD;
a thorough knowledge of Latin, d-reek, and Hebrew was re-&#xD;
quisite. The disputations of the Schoohnen addcd zeal to thc&#xD;
study of these languages. The theological field swarmed with&#xD;
disputants of every nation and grade, who, as a learned law&#xD;
commentator justly 'remarks, "perplexed all theology with&#xD;
their scholastic disquisitions, and bewildered philosophy in&#xD;
&#xD;
the mazes of metaphysical jargon." This was especially so&#xD;
during the fierce disputes occasioned by the Reformation.&#xD;
The good and the bad, the learned and the unlearned, were&#xD;
alike seized with the ambition of being antiquarians, and&#xD;
Schoolmen were seen in flocks traversing the face of Europe&#xD;
in search of musty manuscripts hoarded in the libraries of&#xD;
princes or monasteries, with the desire of wresting something&#xD;
from the ancient cobwebs that would enable them to found a&#xD;
sect and immortalize their names. The offices of the Church,&#xD;
tod; just anterior and subsequent to the Reformation, were&#xD;
sought by men of wealth and influence as portions for younger&#xD;
sons. These causes all combined to make a knowledge of&#xD;
these languages a necessary part of a gentleman's education.&#xD;
But none of them now exist; they have ceased, and why&#xD;
should not the practice founded on them cease also.? Our&#xD;
laws are written in our own language, and need not the aid&#xD;
of a foreign tongue to enable the student to properly under-&#xD;
stand and practice them. The Bible too is in the lap of all&#xD;
the mothers 6f the land, and commentaries enough in English&#xD;
within reach, if read, to make it as obscure and difficult to&#xD;
be understood as if it had never been 'translated from the&#xD;
Greek or the old Vulgate. If, therefore, this useless relic&#xD;
of a semi-barbarous age should be supplantedby a course of&#xD;
practi&amp;amp;d study in Mechanics, Chemistry, Agriculture, etc., the&#xD;
Alma Mater, instead of feasting the student upon Dead-Sea&#xD;
apples, without nutAtion, would perform the part of the&#xD;
~nagician, and give him a ring and lamp, which would require&#xD;
but to be rubbed to' evoke a good 'genie, ready to supply all his&#xD;
wants. Nor need any one fear loss of caste by thus preparing&#xD;
for the active duties of life. There is no privileged class&#xD;
here to mark the man of toil, and where all are equal the&#xD;
majority rule, and the idle few would be the exclusives, and,&#xD;
when they should have occasion to test their superiority,&#xD;
would find themselves far under the ban of public opinion.&#xD;

&#xD;
Elsewhere it is not the case. It is especially not the case in&#xD;
the country whence we have borrowed our college routine.&#xD;
Here a young man may choose his profession to suit his in-&#xD;
clination, and not to suit the pride of his family. And if&#xD;
parents would encourage thi~ child so to choose, and not force&#xD;
his inclination and talent into an unnatural channel, fewer&#xD;
parents would be disappointed at the want of success of their&#xD;
favorite sons.&#xD;
None of the evils, however, which attend the forced adoption&#xD;
of a profession to gratify the whim of a parent, or the adop-&#xD;
tion of one as a matter of respectability, as one puts on holiday&#xD;
clothes, were to be apprehended in young Hamilton'~ case;&#xD;
his profession was a matter of &amp;amp;hoice, and selected as a matter&#xD;
of business, and with thc resolution of following it as a&#xD;
business pursuit. lie therefore suffered none of the disap-&#xD;
pointinents and heartaches which have so often driven young&#xD;
men from their books to liquor and dice; or, if they escape&#xD;
these, indilce a moroseness and hardness of disposition which&#xD;
no after success 3ver softens. With Hamilton, as with other&#xD;
young men, Courts came and went, but clients did not; but he&#xD;
was neither discouraged nor impatient, but toiled on. The&#xD;
third session of the Court in his district left him a~ it found&#xD;

JUST before the spring session of the Court, the jf'ourth&#xD;

of Clarkson, and one who played with him for amusement,&#xD;
and bet to count the game, and drank for good cheer, got&#xD;
into a "spree." It is possible, and only possible, that this&#xD;
book may fall into the hands of some one who does not know&#xD;
what a "spree" is. It is when a man gets drunk and furious,&#xD;
curses every thing and everybody, whoops and halloos through&#xD;
the streets, insults respectable, quiet people, flourishes a pistol&#xD;
and bowie-knife, and frightens everybody; seizes hold of the&#xD;
passer-by, and forces him to take a drink with him, and, if he&#xD;
refuses, insults and denounces him; mounts upon the counter,&#xD;
and kicks off decanters and glasses, an defaces pictures;&#xD;
jumps upon somebody's horse, and gallops over people who&#xD;
cannot run fast enough to get out of the way; rides into a&#xD;
group, and yells like a savage; cocks his pistol in a crowd,&#xD;
and, flourishing it around, swears he is the greatest man in&#xD;
the country, and can whip everybody, and cracks away at all&#xD;
creation in general; and as everybody has not the activity to&#xD;
dodge a bullet, somebody gets shot, and everybody except&#xD;

&#xD;
and everybody is very sorry for th&amp;amp; shooter, that such a sad&#xD;
accident should have befallen him; as the poor fellow will&#xD;
feel very bad about it when he gets sober; and wh~ some-&#xD;
body, if he is not "killed dead," or, if he is, when his friends&#xD;
go among the leading lawyers hunting counsel to prosecute,&#xD;
they are told that lawyers dislike to prosecute, especially for&#xD;
murder, and, in no ease without a double fee. Such is a&#xD;
'.' spree," or was, some few years since. Those who lived in&#xD;
Mississippi, especially in Bluff City, in the bank and shin-&#xD;
plaster times, when leading men lit their cigars with bank..&#xD;
notes, know something' about a "spree." A man. was just&#xD;
no man at all, who could not take a "spree ;" and had as&#xD;
little chance of getting into bank society as a man would of&#xD;
'getting into that of Clarkson, Floyd, Blunt, and others, who&#xD;
could not "take a hand," or a glass of liquor. "Sprees"&#xD;
were respectable then, and peo Clarkson's day would&#xD;
say of them:. "Those were gI 'ions times ;" just as thipse&#xD;
who escaped the neck-pulling an embowelling of Elizabeth's&#xD;
reign, c~dled it "The glorious days of good Queen Bess ;" or&#xD;
the Latin and Grecian poets call the days when people could&#xD;
neithe~~ read nor write, and lived in rude tents and minded&#xD;
sheep, as "the golden age."&#xD;
When sprecing was an expensive luxury, and confined to&#xD;
the rich, it retained its respectability; but when the common&#xD;
folk got at it, and reduced the price of a "good glorious&#xD;
bust," as a "spree" was sometimes improperly called, from&#xD;
one thousand to one hundred dollars, and from that to fifty,&#xD;
and from shooting a man, and having the spree's'" neck&#xD;
broke by a fall from a wild horse, to a bunged-up eye by a&#xD;
fisticuffs, or a broken nose by a fall upon a slippery pavement,&#xD;
it lost much of its charm and respectability; and an&#xD;
olJ-fashioned, gentlemanly "spree" had become somewhat&#xD;
rare. But Col. Isaacs was one of the old regime, a remnant&#xD;
of "those glorious times ;" and, true to old habit, would oc-&#xD;
&#xD;
F&#xD;
&#xD;
occasionally get on a "spree," if for nothing more, just to let&#xD;
the race of church-going greenhorns, who had taken the&#xD;
places made vacant by "sprees" and fast living, see what a&#xD;
"'spree" was. Accordingly, after playing nearly all Satur-&#xD;
day night with Col. Clarkson, Dr. Floyd, Blunt, and Capt.&#xD;
Orr, on Sunday morning he got upon a grand "spree,"&#xD;
breaking glasses, and knocking the billiard balls about; seiz-&#xD;
ing hold of the players, and forcing them to the counter with&#xD;
him to drink; pocketing the balls, and swearing they should&#xD;
not play until they repeated the drink; frightened half the&#xD;
good people of town out of their wits; chased a hotel-keeper,&#xD;
who' was anxious to keep order in his house, all over the&#xD;
tavern with a pistol and bowic-knife, and, failing to catch&#xD;
him, fired a ball or two i through the door of the room into&#xD;
which he locked himself; ordered a negro-boy to break open&#xD;
the door, and upon the negro's begging to be excused, pr~-&#xD;
sented a cocked pistol at his head to frio'hten him into obedi-&#xD;
ence, which, by either design or accident, ~vent off, shooting&#xD;
the negro through the head, killing him instantly. The&#xD;
great body of the people, who knew but little about "sprees,"&#xD;
and the impunity awarded them, were outraged, and de-&#xD;
nounced the thing as a cold-blooded murder; but Col. Clark-&#xD;
son, Floyd, Blunt, and the other members of the playing&#xD;
clubs, who made or controlled' public opinion, "deeply de-&#xD;
plored the sad, accident," and were very sorry on Tsaacs'&#xD;
account, who, "when sober, Was a perfect gentleman."&#xD;
The negro was a valuable one, and Jsaacs found the price&#xD;
of the "spree" fully up to the old respectable standard, and&#xD;
something 1) eyond; and he was not in a situation to meet the&#xD;
just demand of the master of the murdered negro for his&#xD;
value-seventeen hundred dollars--.and 'pay the damage done&#xD;

might undertake to prosecute. The possibility that one&#xD;
would volunteer to vindicate the violated law and an out-&#xD;

unprincipled as to do so just and righteous a thing. The&#xD;
master was willing to tiike the acceptance of Col. Clarkson&#xD;
upon short time for the value 6f the negro; and Jsaacs con-&#xD;
sented to give it upon the condition that there should be no&#xD;
prosecution, to which, of course, the master assented. Col.&#xD;
Clarkson disliked to give the use of his name for such a pur-&#xD;
pose; bu~ to refuse it under such circumstances would have&#xD;
given mortal offence, and Jsaa~s was not a man to offend with&#xD;
impunity. He therefore gave the acceptance; and after-&#xD;
wards, as he feared when he gave it, had it to pay.&#xD;
The affair was brought before the grand jury, and they&#xD;
could not do otherwise than find a "true bill ;" but they and&#xD;
everybody else, Jsaacs included, regarded it as a mere formal&#xD;
thing.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
"He is dead;&#xD;
Not by the public minister of justice,&#xD;
Nor 14 a hired knife; but that self hand&#xD;
Which writ his honor in the acts it did,&#xD;
Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,&#xD;
Spitted the heart."&#xD;
SHARSPEARE.&#xD;
ON the morning when the case of "The State vs. Jsaacs"&#xD;
was set for trial, the defendant walked with great unconcern&#xD;
into the Court-room, and his bloody hand was taken by all&#xD;
the rno~t respectable and influential persons present, officials&#xD;
and all, Judge, Clerk, and Sh~riff. He stepped upon the&#xD;
Judge's stand and passed the ~mpliments of the day with&#xD;
him, and a pleasant joke whit~4i brought a smile to the&#xD;
Judge's face; all of which was seen by the special venire&#xD;
summoned upon the case-a fac-simile of the one before in-&#xD;
troduced to the reader. File passed among the venire, gra-&#xD;
ciously condescending to shake hands with each, particularly&#xD;
with those whose names he had marked upon the copy fur-&#xD;
nished him by the Sheriff, as require~by law, for his attor-&#xD;
neys to select as jurors. Niost of the leading menibers of the&#xD;
bar were engaged for the defence,&#xD;
When the case was called, the District Attorney sat with&#xD;

b6th knees against the desk before him, whittling a pi&amp;amp;e of&#xD;
cypress split from the desk, his lap full of shavings. The&#xD;
Court asks:&#xD;
"Gentlemen, are you ready in this case&#xD;
"The State is ready, T believe. What case is it, your&#xD;
Honor ?" said the District Attorney, rising and brushing the&#xD;
whittling from his lap, looking the very personification of&#xD;
indifference.&#xD;
"No. -. The State vs. Tsaacs."&#xD;
"Let me see the papers. Mr. Sheriff, are the witnesses&#xD;
in this case all here ?"&#xD;
"I do not know, I am sure."&#xD;
"Call them."&#xD;
"If you will let me know who they are, I will."&#xD;
"These names? Hold on; let me see; who are they ?"&#xD;
Scratches first his head and then in the pile of papers before&#xD;
him; picks up one and puts it down, picks up another and&#xD;
puts it down, moves a book or two, and turns to the counsel&#xD;
on the other side and asks:&#xD;
"Gentlemen, have you got the subpoenas in this case&#xD;
"We have our own, not yours. What's that you have in&#xD;
your hand? isn't that it ?"&#xD;
"0 yes! here it is. Call the witnesses, Mr. Sheriff:" hands&#xD;
him the subpoena, and sits down to whit~lin~&#xD;
The Sheriff calls the witnesses; a few answer, but the most&#xD;
important ones do not. He returns the subpoena, and lays it&#xD;
down before the Attorney, who continues to whittle away.&#xD;
The Court grows impatient, and asks:&#xD;
"Mr. Attorney, are you ready to try this case&#xD;
c~W~hat case, your Honor ?"&#xD;
"The ease I have just called, The State vs. Jsaacs."&#xD;
"0-~-~ah~--Mr. Sheriff, call the witnesses in this case."&#xD;
"I have just called them."&#xD;
"Did they answer&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
255&#xD;
&#xD;
"Some did and some didn't."&#xD;
"Did. Mr. - and - answer&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"Call them again.&#xD;
The Sheriff calls again, but no answer.&#xD;
"We are ready for the State, if your Honor please."&#xD;
"Gentlemen, are you ready for the defence ?"&#xD;
They give a quick glance, to be sure that no counsel is en-&#xD;
gaged for the prosecution, and with a confident look and tone&#xD;
promptly answer:&#xD;
"We are ready, if your Honor please," emphasizing the&#xD;
"we," as if they, who had such a good case, were of course&#xD;
ready and anxious for a trial; and it was for the State, with&#xD;
its bad cause, to come halting to trial.&#xD;
All this had its effect upon the venire, who were curious&#xD;
spectators of the whole.&#xD;
"Mr. Sheriffs call over the venire," ordered the Court.&#xD;
"J~ames Brady !"&#xD;
"Come round and be sworn, Mr. Brady."&#xD;
He is sworn to answer questions "of and touching his&#xD;
qualifications as a juror," when-&#xD;
"Have you formed or expressed an opinion of the guilt or&#xD;
innocence of the accused, Mr. Brady ?" is asked in th6 full,&#xD;
musical voice of Hamilton.&#xD;
Its unexpectedness astonished the whole mass of lookers-&#xD;
on, and all pushed forward to see who was engaged for the&#xD;
prosecution, drowning by the noise every thing else.&#xD;
"Silence !" roared out the Sheriff.&#xD;
"Keep silence in Court, Mr. Sheriff; and report those who&#xD;
make a noise."&#xD;
None were so much electrified as the counsel for the de-&#xD;
fence. When glancing around prel~aratory to announcing&#xD;
themselves ready, they noth~ed Hamilton sitting near the&#xD;
District Attorney, but never suspected his being engage~l in&#xD;
&#xD;

the cause; no look or action of his betrayed any such thing;&#xD;
and if they had suspected it, they would hardly have thought&#xD;
a young briefless attorney like him in the way; but there&#xD;
was something in his manner, and in his heavy voice, that&#xD;
admonished them "to i~ake care." They therefore asked&#xD;
him:&#xD;
"Are you engaged for the defence, Mr. hamilton ?"&#xD;
"I am."&#xD;
"Who employed you ?"&#xD;
"You have no right to ask."&#xD;
"Silence, gentlemen I" demanded the Sheriff.&#xD;
The counsel saw at a glance that there was something solid&#xD;
and resolute about the young man; that he was something&#xD;
more than an idle whittler of soft pine and cedar, and likely&#xD;
to prove a dangerous adversary in a case like the one they&#xD;
had in charge; and after whispering together for a moment,&#xD;
they ask:&#xD;
"Will your Honor excuse us for a moment ?"&#xD;
"Certainly."&#xD;
They continue to whisper together; they pull Isaacs into&#xD;
the circle and whisper. The leading counsel rises and says:&#xD;
"If your hlonpr please, it has just been suggested that one&#xD;
of our most important witnesses is absent, and if your Honor&#xD;
will permit us, we w6uld like to have the witnesses for the&#xD;
defence called. Mr. Sheriff, will you call the witnesses for&#xD;
the defence ?"&#xD;
The Sheriff goes to the window and calls.&#xD;
"Did Mr. Flint answer&#xD;
"He did not."&#xD;
"If your Honor please, this is a very important witness&#xD;
for the defence, by far the most important witness in the&#xD;
cause, and the only man who witnessed the unfortunate affair&#xD;
who can give an unbiased statement of it. We were informed,&#xD;
when we announced ourselves as ready, that he wa~ in Court,&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.     257&#xD;
&#xD;
or we would not have so answered. lit is impossible, if your&#xD;
~Honor please, for us to go safely to trial without this witness,&#xD;
and if your Honor will allow us at this stage of the proceed-&#xD;
ings, we will prepare an affidavit for a continuance. I know&#xD;
it is a little informal, but in a case of this magnitude, where&#xD;
the life of a human creature, one of our most respectable and&#xD;
est citizens, is at stake, mere formalities should not deprive&#xD;
s of a full and fair defence."'&#xD;
"Ii cannot grant it unless counsel on the other side consent.&#xD;
Mr. District Attorney, are you willing that the case shall be&#xD;
withdrawn from the jury, and leave be granted to the defence&#xD;
to make an affidavit for a continuance ?"&#xD;
"Sir ?" waking up from his whittling.&#xD;
"Are you willing that the defence may make an affidavit&#xD;
for a continuance ?"&#xD;
"0, cer-"&#xD;
"Hold !" said Hamilton. "We are not willing, your&#xD;
hToi~or."&#xD;
The counsel make a strong appe~d to him, and relate, loud&#xD;
enough to be heard by those of the venire who had crowded&#xD;
around them, what the witness would prove, making out a&#xD;
clear case of justifiable homicide, and how they were deceived&#xD;
into announcing themselves ready by assurances that this im-&#xD;
portant witness was present, and how impossible it was that&#xD;
the State could suffer by delay, and how a good and innocent&#xD;
man might suffer by a forced trial.&#xD;
"I cannot consent," he said, addressing the Court; "blood&#xD;
has becn spilt in our streets, and though it does not cry for&#xD;
vengeance, the innocent, and a much-wronged and outraged&#xD;
community, call aloud upon this Court for protection against&#xD;
a lawless. drunken brawler."&#xD;
"Do y6u denounce me as a drunken brawler !" exclaimed&#xD;
Jsaacs, springing from his seat with a savage, ferocious look&#xD;
that made all around save Hamilton shrink back chilled. The&#xD;

latter looked him. unshrinkingly in the face, and with resolute&#xD;
clearness said:&#xD;
"III do. In a drunken brawl you murdered a poor negro,&#xD;
and you would, if you dared, murder the man who has re-&#xD;
spect enough for his memory to vindicate it; but when you&#xD;
do, you will murder a freeman, and not a slave 1"&#xD;
From the clap and shout that went up from the excited&#xD;
crowd that pressed hard upon the court-railings, the counsel&#xD;
for the' defence saw that they had made a mistake in their&#xD;
effort at side-bar speaking.&#xD;
While the Sheriff was restoring order, and trying to get the&#xD;
names of the offenders to report them for a contempt of Court,&#xD;
the counsel for the defence whispered for a moment to Col.&#xD;
Clarkson, who took Hamilton to one side and remonstrated&#xD;
with him.&#xD;
"I regret, Robert, that your first case in Court should be&#xD;
to prosecute a man for his life."&#xD;
"I am only trying to perform my duty as a good citizen,&#xD;
and to aid in protecting this community against an outlaw."&#xD;
"Who pays you to do it ?"&#xD;
"My conscience."&#xD;
"It is not possible that you are a volunteer in the cause,&#xD;
Robert? It will ruin you! All the respectable men in town&#xD;
are in \Isaacs' favor."&#xD;
"I cannot help that."&#xD;
"Do you not know that it is unpopular to prosecute, espe-&#xD;
cially in a murder ease&#xD;
"II do not seek popularity."&#xD;
"Are you aware that it is the boast of some of the greatest&#xD;
lawyers that the country has ever produced, that they never&#xD;
took a fee to prosecute ?"&#xD;
"If they had taken as many fees to protect the public&#xD;
against bad men and to~enforce the law; as they have to de-&#xD;
fend and turn lo~se criminals and defeat the ends of justice,&#xD;
&#xD;
I'&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING roa AMUSEMENT.                259&#xD;
I would never have been called upon to volunteer in prose-&#xD;
cuting this case."&#xD;
"Robert, let me persuade you not to volunteer your ser-&#xD;
vices in this ease."&#xD;
"II have already done so-I am not willing to withdraw.&#xD;
Dave was black, it is true, but he was a man, every inch of&#xD;
him. We were children together, and in childhood sported&#xD;
upon the same playground, and I have since seen him tried&#xD;
in all that makes a man a man, and he proved true; and shall&#xD;
I now stand by and see him shot down by a drunken bully&#xD;
and bravado, and make no effort to bring the offender to&#xD;
justice? Besides, I have promised his poor old mother&#xD;
who nursed inc when a ehild, and who received the last&#xD;
breath of my sainted mother, to vindicate the memory of her&#xD;
murdered son, and I cannot forfeit my word."&#xD;
"Perhaps you are right. Ii applaud your motive and ~cel-&#xD;
ings, but I[ am sorry you are engaged in the case."&#xD;
"And I am equally sorry to~ do any thing that you do not&#xD;
approve.~~&#xD;
"Come ~entlemen," said the Court, 'ego on with your&#xD;
ease. Proceed with the juror."&#xD;
"Mr. Brady, have you formed or expressed an opinion as&#xD;
to the guilt or innocence of the accused ?"&#xD;
"I have."&#xD;
"Have you conversed with any of the witnesses in relation&#xD;
to the ease&#xD;
"I have not."&#xD;
"Have you not formed this opinion you speak of expressly&#xD;
to disqualify you from serving on this jury, and without' any&#xD;
real knowledge of the ease ?"&#xD;
"If your Honor please," began one of the counsel for the&#xD;
defence, "I object to this mode of interrogating the juror.&#xD;
This gentleman says he has both formed and expressed an&#xD;
opinion, and is of course an incompetent juror, and it matters&#xD;

&#xD;
not for what purpose he may have formed his opinion. Such&#xD;
questions are but consuming the time of the Court, and I&#xD;
hope your Honor will put a stop to it."&#xD;
"I have no wish to ask impertinent questions," said Hamil-&#xD;
ton, " or to consume unnecessarily the time of the Court, and&#xD;
I feel assured that your Honor will indulge me in all needful&#xD;
consumption of time. I am aware, sir, if this man has, as&#xD;
he thinks; formed an opinion of the guilt or innocence of the&#xD;
accused, he is an incompetent juror; but Ii wish to ~how if&#xD;
possible from his answers that he has npt formed an opinion.&#xD;
A man may learn from rumor that a murder has been com-&#xD;
conclude that if such be the, case the party&#xD;
fitted, and                                    ought&#xD;

thereafter hear that the killing ~vas in self-defence, an ., as-&#xD;
sumino' that to                             acquitted,&#xD;
be true, conclude that he ouo'ht to be&#xD;
and he might call this an opinion; but I imagine that n&amp;amp;ther&#xD;
of these is such an opinion as in the law would disqi. alify&#xD;
him as a juror to try the fact. Neither the one noi the&#xD;
other, nor a hundred such opinions would influence the mind&#xD;
of the juror, much less would this be the case if tile opinion&#xD;
was formed as a mere matter of convenience. The law only&#xD;
intends that the juror who is to try the fact shall go into the&#xD;
jury-box free from improper bias. The opinion to disqualify&#xD;
a man must be of such a nature as to affect his judgment,&#xD;
and give an undue bias for or against the defendant, and not&#xD;
a mere supposititious opinion founded upon idle rumor, and&#xD;
made up as a matter of convenience. Men who are competent&#xD;
to decide upon a case of this sort, and have the resolution to&#xD;
decide correctly, without fear, favor, or reward, dislike to&#xD;
have itto do; and if by forming an imaginary opinion they&#xD;
can be excused from the service, they will form it, and in this&#xD;
way help to defeat the ends of justice. The very men w~1lo&#xD;
undertake to practice this fraud upon the law, and evade tile&#xD;
performance of their duty, are the ones first to cr~ out at the&#xD;

&#xD;
inefficiency of the law. If men of talent and education&#xD;
and virtue were to constitute our juries, vicious men would&#xD;
be reluctant to conic before them, and the youth of the coun-&#xD;
try would grow up with an habitual respect for the law and&#xD;
those who execute it, and its certain execution would be a&#xD;
sure safeguard against bad men. The law never will be ex-&#xD;
ecuted if none but the refuse of society si~ upon the jury-.&#xD;
men who are easily swayed by learned counsel. Such mqn&#xD;
go to sleep under tim reading of an indictment, and treat with&#xD;
contempt the instructions of the Court. They are told by&#xD;
lawyers out of court who cannot be elected to a judgeship,&#xD;
that tile 'best talent' will not go upon the bench-the salary is&#xD;
too sinall-can make more at the practice of their profession,&#xD;
etc., and hence such jurymen conclude that these learned&#xD;
0'&#xD;
gentlemen who know so much law that they will not go upon&#xD;
the bench must of course know more than the' man who does&#xD;
go omi it, and they therefore listen t&amp;amp; them rather than the&#xD;
Court. Tile interest of the country demands that men of&#xD;
sense sit upon juries, and the Court ouo'ht not to excuse any&#xD;
0&#xD;
man from this duty for an idle trifling opinion made up to&#xD;
order. If this gentleman ilas formed an opinion of the guilt&#xD;
or innocence of Col. Tsaacs, the accused here, in relation to&#xD;
tile offence of which lie stands charged, he ought not to sit&#xD;
in tile case, but I hold that it is a positive absurdity to talk&#xD;
an opinion founded upon nothing. This gentlenian says&#xD;
lIe has never conversed With any of the witnesses, and of&#xD;
course knows nothing' of the case; no bias therefore can rest&#xD;
upon his mind. If it should appear by the answers of the&#xD;
*juror that he is mistaken, and has not formed an opinion,&#xD;
hut has manufactured something for the Occasion, which&#xD;
he offers as an excuse for avoiding the performance of a dis-&#xD;
agreeable duty, I ask if your ~Ionor will allow him thus' to&#xD;
impose upon the Court. At any rate, I should like to have&#xD;
him answer tile question."&#xD;

"The habit"-by the Court-" of gentlemen, when sum-&#xD;
moned to serve on juries of this sort, hunting up material&#xD;
out of which to manufacture an opinion to excuse them front&#xD;
the performance of their duty, is a most pernicious one; and&#xD;
in consequence of it III have been disgusted more than once&#xD;
upon this circuit, in seeing twelve men, without morals or&#xD;
brains, chosen to acquit criminals, and not to try them-men&#xD;
who neither listened to the testimony, nor understood the&#xD;
law. These counterfeit opinions are far too common, and&#xD;
the man who offers it for an excuse ought to be exposed;&#xD;
and though the opinion utay disqualify him, nevertheless the&#xD;
question in this instance may be asked. Answer the ques-&#xD;
tion, Mr. Brady."&#xD;
"Will you put the question again ?"&#xD;
"Have you not formed this opinion expressly to excuse&#xD;
you from serving upon this case&#xD;
"Well, sir, I do not wish to answer that question."&#xD;
"Answer the question, Mr. Brady, or I shall be under the&#xD;
painful necessity of sending you to jail."&#xD;
"W~ell, sir, that had its influence."&#xD;
"That had its influence, eh? Now, do you know any&#xD;
thing at all of the facts of this base ?"&#xD;
"Very little."&#xD;
"Do yot know any thing ?"&#xD;
"Very little: I heard that Col. Jsaacs had killed a negro&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"And upon that you immediately formed an opinion ?"&#xD;
"No, sir; not immediately. I thought very little about&#xD;
it at the time, and might not have thought of it again, if the&#xD;
Sheriff had not summoned me as a juror."&#xD;
"Then you formed no opinion until sumnioned on this&#xD;
venire&#xD;
"I did not."&#xD;
"And yet you lm~ve formed an opinion ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.                263&#xD;
"Yes, sir, and expressed it."&#xD;
"Very well, sir: stand aside."&#xD;
This severe catechising alarmed a number of others who&#xD;
stood in a similar position to that of Mr. Brady; and, when&#xD;
called, they were careful not to thrust forward their mock&#xD;
opinions, but were content to serve as jurors. They were&#xD;
always accepted by HamiltQn, if they were men likely to&#xD;
have an opinion of their own; but for the same cause they&#xD;
were invariably challenged by the defence. Much the larger&#xD;
portion of the venire were idle vagabonds, who were too laz'y&#xD;
to work, and esteemed it a godsend to be put upon a jury,&#xD;
and hence were always convenient when a venire had to be&#xD;
summoned; and the Sheriff, like a well-fed Berkshire, was not&#xD;
over-fond of motion, ann, to save the trouble of riding over&#xD;
the country to hunt up men to serve on juries, gathered up&#xD;
the rabble. For this reason, nine out of ten of Mississippi&#xD;
juries, selected to try men for their lives, would make splen-&#xD;
did pictures for the frontispiece of a comic almanac, with the&#xD;
Sheriff at their head, and the District Attorney in the back-&#xD;
ground. There are the halt, the lame, and the blind, long&#xD;
legs and short legs, cross-eyes and cock-eyes, high shirt-col-&#xD;
lars and no shirt-collars at all, long coat-sleeves and sleeves&#xD;
thiLt stop at the elbow, pants with long legs turned up at the&#xD;
bottom, and pants with legs that scorned to come nearer than&#xD;
within six inches of the huge brogans.&#xD;
hamilton was a~txious to keep from the jury all such hor-&#xD;
rible imitations of humanity, and generally succeeded in&#xD;
challenging them for cause; and when he failed in this,&#xD;
exercised his right of a peremptory challenge until his num-&#xD;
ber was exhausted. He had nearly exhausted this right, had&#xD;
only one left, and was anxious to reserve it for a juror whose&#xD;
name would soon be called, who ~as a sort of striker of Col.&#xD;
Isaacs, and ha ted the negro man Dave, who had been killed,&#xD;
because his master had refused to permit this man to flog&#xD;

&#xD;
him. The circumstance was as fol1o~vs: The man had got&#xD;
drunk upon one occasion, and interfered with Dave's work;&#xD;
and because he was, gently pushed aside by the negro, he&#xD;
seized a knife, and undertook to stab him, when the boy&#xD;
~pushed him dowi~, and walked over him. He was chastised&#xD;
by his master, but this man was enraged at both master and&#xD;
slave, because he was not permitted to wreak his brutal ven~&#xD;
glance upon the negro. Hamilton, knowing these facts,&#xD;
feared that he would make a bad juror, but feared, also, that&#xD;
he would not be able to challenge him for cause, and hence&#xD;
was anxious to reserve his remaining peremptory challenge.&#xD;
Just at this time, a Mr. Rice was called. He was a (TOSS&#xD;
between a fool and a knave, and represented both parents&#xD;
remarkably well. He lived no one knew how or where;&#xD;
sometimes acted as barkeeper of a low do~gery, sometimes as&#xD;
deputy night-watch, but most of the time ~vas a general&#xD;
rounder-in at groceries; and was a huge cheer of tobae~o&#xD;
and guzzler of mean whiskey, and great on election days;&#xD;
and Jsaacs was a politician, and chanced to be on the side to&#xD;
serve the interests of which Rice was in the habit of lying&#xD;
and cheating, and Isaacs was just the man iRice would be&#xD;
likely to perjure himself for. When called, he came forward&#xD;
with a high step, like a horse with string-i~alt; had a high&#xD;
shirt-collar, made passably clean for the occasion: his entire&#xD;
suit might have been the cast-off garments of "Ichabod."&#xD;
"Mr. Rice, have you formed or expressed an opinion as&#xD;

"I have not."&#xD;

"At the hotel when it occurred, lived in the town eveY&#xD;
since, and never said a word about it yourself; nor heard any&#xD;

"I have sumf'n else to do besides talk 'n about other folk~'&#xD;

"Have you any conscientious scruples as to the infliction&#xD;
of capital punishment ?"&#xD;
"Any what ?"&#xD;
"Arc you opposed to having a man hung if he had killed&#xD;

"You do not think it would be right to hang him for kill-&#xD;
ing a 'nigger,' heh ?"&#xD;
"No, sir, I don't."&#xD;
"You can stand aside."&#xD;
By care and a determination to do his full duty, a tolerably&#xD;
fair jury was impanelled. While the jury were being&#xD;
sworn, a friend of Col. Isaacs took Hamilton to one side, and&#xD;
said:&#xD;
"Col. isaacs is pleased with the manner in which you have&#xD;
thus far conducted the case against him; and as you are not&#xD;
regularly engaged by any one to assist in the prosecution, and&#xD;
as a man is excusable for making use of all honorable means&#xD;
to save himself from ~ conviction which may seriously en-&#xD;
danger his life, he hopes you will not take it as an offence for&#xD;
him to try and retain your services in his defence; and he&#xD;
ha~ authorized me to offer you a thousand dollars to aid him."&#xD;
"I am not worth much," said Hamilton, "but Col. Isaacs&#xD;
is not rich enough' to buy me."'&#xD;
"He intends no insult, no bribe, but is really desirous of&#xD;
engaging your services."&#xD;
"They are, not for sale."&#xD;
"Why should you refuse a large fee to defend, and yet&#xD;

volunteer to prosecute ?" said one of the counsel who heard&#xD;
the conversation.&#xD;
"I do not care to discuss the matter, gentlemen. I know&#xD;
very little of Col. Isaacs, and care less. I intend to do my&#xD;
duty; band I advise you and Col. Isaacs to look well to the&#xD;
merits of your cause. You had better send for Mr. Flint."&#xD;
The last remark wa~ said in a spirit of satire.&#xD;
The case consumed the larger portion of the ~Yeek. The&#xD;
interest which the first day's proceeding excited kept an ex-&#xD;
pectant crowd in the court - room during the entire trial.&#xD;
Jiamilton's management of the case during its progress&#xD;
gained for him golden opinions "from all sorts of people ;"&#xD;
and it was his province to close the argument. The counsel&#xD;
had been particularly severe in their criticisms upon him in&#xD;
volunteering to aid iii taking the life of a fellow-man, as&#xD;
presenting private revenge, etc., all of which he bore with&#xD;
stoical indifference. Expectation was high, and his friends'&#xD;
feared it was more than he could meet; bu~ wl~ en he arose,&#xD;
full of his subject, and his tall, commanding figure half a&#xD;
head higher than the ~nass around him, his highI, square fore-&#xD;
head, large, lustrous ~yes, full, round, sonorous voice, and&#xD;
long arms, that moved by a mental impulse, giving forqe and&#xD;
emphasis to argunients in themselves convincing, and espe-&#xD;
cially when lie moVed off with a stateliness and dignity of&#xD;
manner and argument like "the horse that knows his rider,"&#xD;
all fear was lost in admiration. The counsel saw a god full-&#xD;
grown from the head of Mercury. When he spoke ot~ The&#xD;
orgies of the night before the killing, the spree afterw5ds,&#xD;
and let fall his arm like a very Vulcan upon the vicious habit&#xD;
of playing for amusement, and betting t9 count the game,&#xD;
the hair bristled upon more heads than that of Js~cs.&#xD;
"The fathers," said he, "leaders in the social circle, cen-&#xD;

amusements, and rally to the defence of a man who has the&#xD;

which will bring forth a plentiful crop for your and their&#xD;
children to reap. When you and they are gone, those who&#xD;

with the household-gods you leave them. You owe it toycur-&#xD;
selves, you owe it to them, and, above all, you owe ~t to your&#xD;
God, to rebuke and stay these broadcast sowers of vice and&#xD;
sin, disease and moral death, these sowers of the 'seeds of the&#xD;
moral Upas tree. I ask not vengeance; that is with 0 od; I&#xD;
am willing even thaf the blood of poor, inoffensive Davy shall&#xD;
smoke and dry in your public thoroughfare in vain, if II&#xD;
thought that were an end; but it is not the. end: it is not&#xD;
even the beginning of the end. Public virtue is a name,&#xD;
and religion a byword, and too often a scoff. What hope&#xD;
have you, what hope has anybody, in your children, the&#xD;
young men who swarm along your streets, fashionable idlers,&#xD;
genteel loafers? What hope does the public repose in the&#xD;
majority of the, sons of wealthy parents of the South?&#xD;
None; and why? Because vice and idleness are made at-&#xD;
tractive and respectable, and virtue, and industry, and habit-&#xD;
ual obedience to the laws of the land and the rules of good&#xD;
society, treated with the coldness of unwelcome guests. These&#xD;
are plain, hard truths, and should not be blinked. It is no&#xD;
pleasure to me to refer to them; it is painful to know that&#xD;
they are truths. The remedy, in a great measure, is with&#xD;
the courts and juries of the country. Whenever the mon-&#xD;
ster vice comes within the reach of their truncheon, let them&#xD;
smite him down, and make the temple of justice a terror to&#xD;
evil-do~rs, a place where innocence may fly for help and pro-&#xD;
tection, and a reform must and will follow. If courts and&#xD;
juries had never winked at vice, and bad men had never&#xD;
been permitted to go out of this temple, which should be&#xD;
sacved to justice, with 6clat, and left to riot in their wrong,&#xD;

&#xD;
your streets would long since have been clean~of blood. The&#xD;
profession of which I am but a young and inexperienced&#xD;
member, is not altogether free from blame in this particular.&#xD;
Its influence has been mainly cast in favor of the acquittal of&#xD;
criminals ~ not because the members of it feel less interest in&#xD;
the preservation of order and good morals than others, but&#xD;
because, when engaged in a criminal case, they are usually&#xD;
retained for the defence, the State always being represented&#xD;
by an attorney elected for that purpose; and it is but natural&#xD;
that the feeling's and sympathies channel in&#xD;
should o'o in the&#xD;
which they are most accustomed to flow. And a word here&#xD;
in reply to the criticism of gentlemen upon myself and m&#xD;
connection with this case. They mock at me as the repre-&#xD;
sentative of private revenge, or, if not that, a volunteer&#xD;
hangman. It is a weak cause that needs such props. I am&#xD;
not ashamed to acknowledge before you that I did yield to&#xD;
the request of the mother of the deceased, blackamoor as she&#xD;
is, to volunteer to vindicate the memory of her son, and&#xD;
bring his cold-blooded murderer to justice. 'And I did it&#xD;
the more willingly because the murdered man was m~ friend;&#xD;
yes, black as was his skin, he had a soul white as yours or&#xD;
mine, and he was my true and honorable friend, and I am&#xD;
proud to remember hi~m as such. I know not that it will&#xD;
make his ashes rest the quieter to learn that his murderer&#xD;
has, been slain by the law; but it will make other mothers&#xD;
draw their nestlings closer to their breasts to know that this&#xD;
wild tiger has been turned loose from his cage, again to be-&#xD;
come the 'terror of the jungle. It is these mothers, and&#xD;
their and your children, and the violated law, anct ~ coin-&#xD;
munity who press hard around these court-raili~igs, beseech-&#xD;
ing you for justice, and serving you by their presence to the&#xD;
right, that I represent. By this standard of right I am will-&#xD;
ing to be measured; they-~the counsel for defence -are&#xD;
measured by thc length of the defendant's, purse-string. I&#xD;

would have you protect the public against a lawless, bad man,&#xD;
and a still more lawless, bad vice. If you do this, you will&#xD;
have the approval of your own consciences, and i~h e thanks&#xD;
and prayers of those who need all the force of. your strong&#xD;
arm to protect them and maintain the law."&#xD;
During this impassioned appeal, which loses much of its&#xD;
force upon paper, the possibility of a conviction first flashed&#xD;
upon the mind of (Jol. llsaacs. The effect was alarming; the&#xD;
wild stare frightful.&#xD;
At the close of the speech the jury retired, and soon re-&#xD;
turned and handed their verdict to the clerk, who read, amid&#xD;
he profoundest silence, "We, the jury, find the prisoner&#xD;
guilty." Its stunning effect upon Isaacs was painful to wit-&#xD;
ness. It was the first time in his life he felt that he was not&#xD;
absolute master of himself and his actions-the director and&#xD;
shaper of his own destiny; the first' time he ever felt the&#xD;
presence of a power stronger than his will. He had a strong&#xD;
determined will, and was a buld thinker and resolute actor,&#xD;
and had always the proud consciousness of an independent&#xD;
self-sustaining man, and claimed to have every thing he was&#xD;
master of by his own exertion except his life-and that lie had&#xD;
long since ceased to value as a boon-would have taken or&#xD;
given it away for a trifle; indeed had often thought of taking&#xD;
it, but the idea of its being taken by another, or by the law,&#xD;
had never occurred to him before, and the thought was terrible.&#xD;
The thought even of involuntary confinement for one night&#xD;
was more awful than an eternity of c5nfincment in the grave-&#xD;
which his skeptical philosophy taught him was the end of&#xD;
man. He had been a soldier, and obeyed because he had his&#xD;
consent to do so; but he would have preferred death upon the&#xD;
battle-field to chains or a prison-ship. Before him was the&#xD;
prospect of death-and of all deaths the most disgraceful--&#xD;
and no avenue left through which to fight his way and fall, ~&#xD;
if he must, by the blade of his enewiy, fighting for life and&#xD;

liberty. He gave a quick savage look around, and those&#xD;
standing near were startled by hearing a click, click, quickly&#xD;
succeeded by the report of a pistol! Col. Isaacs was no more!&#xD;
He had shot himself through the heart! He had taken his&#xD;
last drink for good cheer, played his last game for amusement,&#xD;
and bet his last dollar to count the game. The game of life&#xD;
was played out, and he had lost the stake-a stake that dollars&#xD;
will not pay-and begun a game that dollars will not count-&#xD;
to continue through an age that will not waste away.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXI.&#xD;
"Praise is the reflection doth from virtue rise."&#xD;
&#xD;
THE tragical termination of the prosecution disappointed&#xD;
the elation of Hamilton's friends at the completeness of his&#xD;
success, and chastened the exhilaration which he migl~t other-&#xD;
wise have felt. He had tI e satisfaction of having performed&#xD;
his duty, and of finding hi nself, at a bound, in a position in&#xD;
his profession equal to the older members of the bar. Col.&#xD;
Clarkson, as the trial prog essed, and the moral beauty and&#xD;
grandeur of Hamilton's m nd and the strength and compass&#xD;
of his intellect grew into pi~oportions before him, could not&#xD;
help feeling an interest in ~is success jn spite of his desire to&#xD;
see Jsaacs acquitted. As he bore reports home of the pro-&#xD;
gress~~of thc trial, and of the play and dazzle of Hamilton's&#xD;
genius, the eyes of Agnes sparkled with peculiar brightness&#xD;
and her heart beat quick. At the close of the trial, Col.&#xD;
Clarkson desired Ha~nilton to bear the melancholy story home&#xD;
and excuse him to his family, while he gave his attention to&#xD;
the remains of his deceased friend. As Hamilton approached&#xD;
the house, with weary step and n~elancholy mien, Mrs. Clark-&#xD;
son and Agnes advanced to meet him. Agnes placed her&#xD;
arm in his; she looked up into his face and said, "Father has&#xD;
reported to us your success; and 0! Robert! you do not&#xD;
know how happy and proud it has made me. I knew you were&#xD;
equal to it; but I wanted others to know it. It is not that&#xD;
you are eloquent, or that you are learned, but that you are&#xD;
true."&#xD;
&#xD;
"You have not heard of the fatal termination of the&#xD;
trial ?"&#xD;
"No! Neither you nor pa are going to fight a duel with&#xD;
him ?"&#xD;
"No;he is past fighting duels."&#xD;
"Mercy! Mr. Hamilton; you have not killed him ?" IRe-&#xD;
leasing his arm and stepping back with a wild anxious look.&#xD;
"You need not fear my touch; there is no blood on my&#xD;
hands or conscience, though blood has been spilt. When&#xD;
the jury brought in a verdict of guilty, Isaacs shot himself&#xD;
through the heart before those near him were aware of his&#xD;
design."&#xD;
"0 Robert, you don't tell me !" exclaimed both ladies at&#xD;
bnce. Agnes returned to his side, and taking his arm with&#xD;
both hands; looked up and said:&#xD;
"0 Robert! did the poor infatuated man rush into the&#xD;
presence of his God with all his sins upon him! How sorry&#xD;
I fed tbr you! How little did I think, whilst revelling in&#xD;
the jo~ occasioned by the report of your success, that the&#xD;
glory of your triumph would b&amp;amp; thus rudely snatched from&#xD;
me by the bloody hand of the suicide, and you, ~crhaps, terrified&#xD;
frQm treading farther in the path of right for right'~ sake !"&#xD;
"I am~i 'sorry that Col. ]isaacs should thus have terminated&#xD;
his stormy life-more, however, for his sake than mine. Bet-&#xD;
ter that he should have killed himself, and robbed the gallows&#xD;
of its dtmes, than have killed a better man; which might have&#xD;
been the case had he been acquitted~ Bloody as has been&#xD;
the issue, it will not have a feather's weight in shaping or&#xD;
unshaping my course for the future. I be1iev~ I did right,&#xD;
and I should do it all over again if I knew the termination&#xD;
would be the same."&#xD;
"But then it is so sad !"&#xD;
"Very true, and II regret it; but I shall not be swerved&#xD;
from the path of duty because bad men do rash things. You&#xD;

upon my heart, in assuring me that your father is not dis-&#xD;
pleased with my course."&#xD;
"0, he is not displeased; on the contrary, is every way&#xD;
pleased. At first he said ~he was sorry. you had volunteered&#xD;
in the cause, but afterwards he was pleased that it was' so; that&#xD;
you had a~ted from principle, and not from a desire of gain."&#xD;
"lie remonstrated with me at first, and I thought was dis-&#xD;
pleased at my refusal to withdraw from the case; and it dis-&#xD;
tressed me. Next to the approval of my conscience, Ii desire&#xD;
the approval of you three. It is a material portion of the&#xD;
reward I expect for a virtuous action; and it helps to instruct&#xD;
and direct my conscience. The censure of either of you&#xD;
would cloud any 'success I might meet with in life."&#xD;
"I have s'een very little in you to condemn, thus far,&#xD;
Robert," said Mrs. Clarkson.&#xD;
".1 thank you for saying so. 'It will be one of the aims of,&#xD;
my life to retain your good yinion. What I am you have&#xD;
contributed no little to make me. If I have walked in the&#xD;
"right way,' it is because your hand pointed it out to me."&#xD;
"Another and a smoother hand had shaped your moral&#xD;
ends, before n~ine was reached out to you," said Mrs. Clark-&#xD;
son.&#xD;
"True; and I thank you for a compliment to the mother&#xD;
whose memory I shall ever revere; but your hand was&#xD;
stretched out t6 me at a most opportune season. But for&#xD;
your good counsels, and this dear face here, blushing at its&#xD;
own praise, thaw shone on me through five long years of exile,&#xD;
I might have i~ade shipwreck of all the good lessons received&#xD;
from a sainted another , who, if angels ever pray for us mortals&#xD;
-and I believe they do, let others call it superstition if they&#xD;
will-has made many a prayer in that world, high 4bove the&#xD;
petty trifles and heartaches of this, for the earthly guardians&#xD;
of her son."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
They had unconsciously stopped during the conversation,&#xD;
and now walked slowly and in silence to the house. As they&#xD;
were ascending the steps, 1~Jrs. Clarkson said:&#xD;
"I suppose Mr. Clarkson is with the remains of Col.&#xD;
Isaacs."&#xD;
"Ii beg your pardon; he told me to inform you of what&#xD;
bad occurred, and say that he would not be home to dinner."&#xD;
"You will dine with us&#xD;
"If agre cable, I would like to do so."&#xD;
Mrs. Clarkson left to giye orders about her household affairs,&#xD;
and Agnes said:&#xD;
"0 Robert, Ii am so proud of you 1"&#xD;
"I would rather you loved me."&#xD;
"I do love you; I have always loved you; it is an old&#xD;
tbeling, but I am proud of you too; this is a new feeling, and&#xD;
makes me love you all the more."&#xD;
"Are your 'love and pride together sufficient to secure for&#xD;
me a favorable answer to the demand you are willing I shall&#xD;
make, at some period in ~the uncertain future, of this soft&#xD;
white hand ?"&#xD;
"Whenever the occasion comes when this 'soft white&#xD;
hand,' as you call it, can be of any service to you, or add any&#xD;
thing to your real happiness, you can have it. But that time&#xD;
has not yet come."&#xD;
"But may not something happen to prevent it from ever&#xD;
coming ?"&#xD;
"If it should happen by your fault or mine, it had better&#xD;
happen before our volition is gone. If either of us should&#xD;
ever do any thing by which we deserve to forfeit the other's&#xD;
respect or love, better that it be done before stronger vows&#xD;
p~ss between us than after Wards. I do not think such a&#xD;
thing at all likely, and am willing at all events to trust&#xD;
&#xD;
"And I am willing to trust you. I never feared any thing&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC8172-00000139"/>&#xD;
of' that sort, and yet a thousand things may happen to divide&#xD;
us."'&#xD;
"It frightens me to hear you talk so ! Name one of the&#xD;
thousand."&#xD;
"You might die." -&#xD;
"I hope my memory would be none the less dear because&#xD;
other vows were not plighted between us'; and marrying&#xD;
would not keep me alive."&#xD;
"Your father might become displeased with me, and re-&#xD;
fuse his consent to our union."&#xD;
" Why, Robert, what makes you talk so ? you distress your-&#xD;
self and me. What has dear papa said or done that makes&#xD;
you talk so ?"&#xD;
"Nothing, Do not look so pale. You asked for some of&#xD;
the thousand reasons that might occur to prevent our union,&#xD;
and I was weak and foolish enough to guess at some. I know&#xD;
of none, and apprehend none, and was very foolish, to suggest&#xD;
any, and crave your pardon. To prove how sincere my re-&#xD;
pentance is, I will not press upon you our union again, until&#xD;
an occasion comes when I can ask it as altogether proper."&#xD;
"And when that time comes, for weal or for woe I will be&#xD;
yours."&#xD;
"For weal let us hope it will be."&#xD;
"For weal I certainly think it will, and pray that it may&#xD;
be."&#xD;
If Hamilton had desired to advertise his powers, he could&#xD;
not have done so more effe-ctually than the tragical end of his&#xD;
first case had done for him. Reports of the most exaggerated&#xD;
character spread in relation to it, all attributing the tragedy&#xD;
to his eloquence. No persons were more affected by the re-&#xD;
ports than the prisoners in jail awaiting their trial. They'&#xD;
were clamorous to secure his services; but he was prudent&#xD;
enough to avoid wearing the gloss from his newly made repu-&#xD;
tation, by declining fees except in cases where the right was&#xD;
&#xD;
on'the side of the accused. His determination to be right,&#xD;
and to do right, saved him from cheapening him self by un-&#xD;
dertaking an indiscriminate defence of all the criminals who&#xD;
applied to him. Hie was not inflated by vanity, and though&#xD;
the growth of his reputation was sudden as was the gourd of&#xD;
Jonah, it had merit and principle to sustain it, and, so far&#xD;
from declining, it continued. gradually to increase and&#xD;
strengthen.&#xD;

SHA1~5PEARE.&#xD;
THE death of Col. Tsaacs produced a very serious effect&#xD;
upon Capt. Orr; and the friends of the latter felt great con-&#xD;
cern on his account. The two had been inseparable for years;&#xD;
had fought public and private battles together; enjoyed pros-&#xD;
perity and suffered adversity together; and their sudden&#xD;
separation fell with crushing effect upon Orr. Isaacs had&#xD;
been his military commander, and the Captain was accustomed&#xD;
to follow wherever his intrepid senior would lead. He was&#xD;
at all times, whether on or off duty, ready to answer any call&#xD;
made upon him by Isaacs. Like his Colonel, he had no re-&#xD;
ligious or moral scruples that wbuld deter him from doing&#xD;
what his inclination might prompt. lile had no~ the resolute&#xD;
determination .of Jsaacs; and though~ would follow through&#xD;
fire and flood, he could not lead.. For several days after the&#xD;
death of Isaacs, Orr was gloomy and taciturn, and at times&#xD;
exhibited singular fancies. At one time he would dress him.-&#xD;
self in the most elaborate wedding-attire; at another in full&#xD;
military officer's dress, as if ready to place himself under the&#xD;
orders of his superior. He also drank deep, and was more&#xD;
or less intoxicated all the time. His friends remonstrated,&#xD;
with him, but to no purpose. He failed to make his appear-&#xD;

ance at breakfast one morning, and his friends going to his&#xD;
roomto ascertain the cause, found him sitting in full military&#xD;
dress, stark and stiff. He had taken poison! Upon the&#xD;
table by him was a note, addressed to Col. Isaacs, which read&#xD;
thus:&#xD;

Among his papers was the following note, addressed to&#xD;
Frank Vaughan, written the day after the death of Col.&#xD;
Isaacs:&#xD;
DEAR FRANK :-IDo you recollect the conversation which&#xD;
Col. Isaacs and myself had with you at Cooper's Well, some&#xD;
two or three summers since? Before you get this, Col.&#xD;
Jsaacs and myself will both fill a suicide's grave-the result&#xD;
of the evils against which we then warned you. "~Beware&#xD;
of liquor, dice, and bad women," were my last words to you&#xD;
then: I repeat them now. I am a coward! I would not.&#xD;
live, and yet I fear to die! "How stale, fiat, and unprofita-&#xD;

Ifere he had suddenly broken off, as if he had approached&#xD;

in the paper, marking a place where a tear had fallen.&#xD;

of a bad woman, but never deceive a good one."&#xD;

and was still handsome. The eldest girl stood transfixed with&#xD;
a stony gaze as the hearse rumbled by. The others were&#xD;
weeping' bitterly but noiselessly. They did not know;why&#xD;
they should swallow their grieg, and not express it like other&#xD;
children; 'but their mother said "Flush !" in such a soft, sad,&#xD;
heart-reaching tone that they cried in silence. It did not re-&#xD;
quire a second look to tell that one' was the victim, the others&#xD;
the children of the suicide. It explained why he had broken&#xD;
off so suddenly in his letter to Vaughan, and why, in all his&#xD;
warnings to him, he had coupled woman's name. It would&#xD;
seem that he had never, until writing the note to Vaughan,&#xD;
thought that even a bad woman might have been made so by&#xD;
a worse man. That thought seemed to strike him when he&#xD;
penned the disjointed sentence, "Yes, beware of a bad wo-&#xD;
man, but never deceive a good one." It was a soliloquy&#xD;
which ought to have brought to his imagination the picture&#xD;
which those who followed his bier saw in front of the cottage,&#xD;
where once his footsteps sounded gladly in the hall, and have&#xD;
admonished' him to make what little reparation lay in his&#xD;
power for those who' were fain to hide from the hard-judging&#xD;
world the sorrow with which his untimely death wrung their&#xD;
hearts. Let it be a warning to such as have trod, like him,&#xD;
the same path of vice.&#xD;
These sad terminations of the lives of two of his compan-&#xD;
ions came with a warning emphasis to Col. Clarkson, that he&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

&#xD;
could not altogether disregard. For several weeks he was&#xD;
thoughtful, and resisted the entreaties of his friends to join&#xD;
in the game. Old habit, however, was more powerful than&#xD;
any warning the grave could give, a~d by degrees he fell&#xD;
back into the old routine. At the solicitation of some of&#xD;
'his friends in New Orleans, he determined to spend the&#xD;
'ensuing summer season at Last Island, a place of fashion-&#xD;
able summer resort for a number of the wealthy seekers of&#xD;
pleasure in the Crescent City and other portions of Louisiana.&#xD;
Mrs. Clarkson had an indefinable dread of spending the&#xD;
summer at Last Island, which she could not well explain.&#xD;
She tried to attribute it to a fear that her husband might fall&#xD;
in with worse company there than he would meet else-&#xD;
where; but she was not satisfied with the effort, as they~&#xD;
would meet only a small and select company upon the Island,&#xD;
and though playing might be expected, i~ was much less&#xD;
likely to degenerate into the meaner grade of gambling than.&#xD;
at watering-places they had previously visited. The sensa-&#xD;
tion was like the shadow of coming evil. She could not&#xD;
account for it, 'and felt ashamed to have it influence her de-&#xD;
cision, but she could not avoid it. Her husband laughed at&#xD;
her fears~, and obtained her reluctant consent to disregard&#xD;
them, and spend the summer upon the Island. Her feelings&#xD;
proved contagious, and the packing and preparing for~ their&#xD;
departure was a melancholy task, such as it had not been&#xD;
upon previous similar occasions. Agnes took a solitary walk&#xD;
over the garden, kissing the sweet flowers that bloomed&#xD;
around her; and wept as she took leave of the servants ~that;i';&#xD;
were to be left behind, scare ely knowing why. Every thing&#xD;
around seemed sadly reluctant at the idea of 'separation.&#xD;
The long shadows of the trees appeared stretching out their&#xD;
arms to entreat her stay; and the sunbeams lingered longer&#xD;
upon her fair cheek, unwillii~g to leave so sweet ~ resting-&#xD;
place; and her heart sank within her as she bade adieu to all&#xD;
these home-scenes and treasures.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIII.&#xD;
"Of winds and waves, the strangely mingled sounds&#xD;
IRide heavily; the night winds hollow sweep,&#xD;
Mocking the sounds of human lamentation."&#xD;
LAST ISLAND is situated in the Gulf of Mexico, distant fro~n&#xD;
the mainland about twenty miles, and from the nearest poi h t&#xD;
five or six miles. It is twenty-five miles in length, and from.&#xD;
a half to three quarters in width, and only thi'ee or four feet&#xD;
above the waters of the Gulf. Exposed as it was to the full&#xD;
sweep of the water and breezes of the GuW it had become a&#xD;
most desirable resort in the summer months, and the planters&#xD;
in the Gulf. Parishes of Attuckapas, Lafourche, and Terre&#xD;
Bonne, made it a summer retreat for themselves and families.&#xD;
Numbers from the city of New Orleans, and an occasional in-&#xD;
dividual from other States, also resorted to it in preference&#xD;
to more crowded and ,less agreeable watering-places. A fine&#xD;
hotel had been erected upon the Island, and persons of wealth&#xD;
had built handsome summer cottages and some expensive&#xD;
edifices which were furnished with taste and elegance. All&#xD;
that an unstinted purse and the best taste in the Magnolia&#xD;
State could do to make the Island a summer Eden had been&#xD;
done. The barren sand-bank had been made the seat of&#xD;
elegance, refinement, and hospitality, and from four to five&#xD;
hundred of the wealth, talent~, beauty, and chivalry of the&#xD;
State of Louisiana and a few from Mississippi had gathered&#xD;
there. The leading officials of the State, executive, judicial,&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING FOR AMUSEMENT.    283&#xD;
&#xD;
and legislative, were there, and Colonel and Mrs. Clarkson&#xD;
found themselves surrounded by enlightened and congenial&#xD;
society, unsurpassed by any in the United States. There was&#xD;
an openness and abundance in the Creole hospitality that&#xD;
amounted almost to profuseness, and put everybody at ease,&#xD;
and the summer days fl&amp;amp;w swiftly and delightfully by. Mrs.&#xD;
Clarkson found in the educated and polished ladies of La-&#xD;
fourche and Assumption, material to drive away all the fore-&#xD;
bodings of evil which had made her reluctant to spend the&#xD;
summer on the Island, and often congratulated herself upon&#xD;
the pleasure which this delightful society opened to her.&#xD;
Col. Clarkson, too, found congenial spirits-men, even this&#xD;
elegant circle, who would play as much and bet as high as he&#xD;
could desire, but all in the most gentlemanly way; and though&#xD;
they would talk fast and sometimes loud, their conversation&#xD;
iiever sank to a level with that of the bully and blackguard.&#xD;
It was seductive, and for that reason the most dangerous&#xD;
companionship in the world. But the majority of visitors of&#xD;
both wealth and talent did npt participate in the games-&#xD;
preferring other sources of enjoyment which their education,&#xD;
habits, and the Island furnished. Ag~es too found v society&#xD;
to her taste. She met there a large number of young ladies&#xD;
of wealth and beauty, and they were not without young men&#xD;
of taste and education to serve them, and who spared no pains&#xD;
to make their time pass pleasantly.&#xD;
One Friday evening, as Agnes was walking upon the beach&#xD;
with some of her companions, listening to the dash of the surf&#xD;
and the sigh of the summer breeze that lifted her locks, one&#xD;
of her associates, who had been noticing the passengers from&#xD;
the steamer which had just come in from the mainland,&#xD;
exclaimed:&#xD;
"0! Agnes, see! What venerable gray-haired old man&#xD;
is that?"&#xD;
Agnes turned to look, and saw the Hermit approaching&#xD;

&#xD;
them. Delighted as she was to see him, it caused a chill&#xD;
about her heart that made her feel sick and faint. Recover-&#xD;
ing from the sensation, she bounded forward, threw her arms&#xD;
around his neck, and kissed him.&#xD;
"Is any thing the matter ?" sIre asked.&#xD;
"Nothing at home; all well there."&#xD;
"Any thing the matter here ?"&#xD;
"I do not know. I am growing old, I fear, and super-&#xD;
stitious. I felt as if some evil approached you, and ydu needed&#xD;
my presence, and I am here to serve you."&#xD;
"0, my dear friend what can it be !"&#xD;
"Do not be alarmed; it may be nothing but the fancy of a&#xD;
foolish, fond old man."&#xD;
"Do not say so; your presentiments have too much the&#xD;
~hape of reality; and I have had a presentiment of evil myself,&#xD;
and so has ma. To-day, when I was reciting my prayers, in&#xD;
'the little temporary chapel out there, the melancholy moan&#xD;
of the wind through the casement inspired me with a feeling&#xD;
of sadness Ii have not been able to get rid of all day."&#xD;
"It may be nothing; but I thought it best to be here, and&#xD;
I have come. I did not intend that you should know of my&#xD;
pi~esence unless I found you threatened with danger, and my&#xD;
efforts necessary for your safety. Do not be sad."&#xD;
"I cannot avoid being sad, but Ii feel all the safer by your&#xD;
presence."&#xD;
"Let your parents know I am here, and what brought me,&#xD;
but tell no one else."&#xD;
Nothing happened of note that night. Agnes felt the&#xD;
presence of her strange intrepid guardian, and knew he kept&#xD;
watch near here ' To avoid the curious looks of strangers,&#xD;
which were unpleasam1mt to him, he had consented to become&#xD;
the guest of Col. Clarkson, who occupied a rented. cottage.&#xD;
There was a gloom over the little circle all day on Saturday,&#xD;
notwithstanding the efforts of each to dispel it.&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING     FOR   AMUSEME NT.           285&#xD;
~ Towards evening a heavy northeast wind began to blow.&#xD;
It sounded like a dirge to the inmates of the cottage, as it&#xD;
howled around the corners and whistled through the case-&#xD;
ment. It would occasionally lull, then dash over the Island,&#xD;
catch up the sand, whirl it in eddies through the air, then&#xD;
sprinkle it over the blue sparkling waters. The wind con-&#xD;
tinued to increase during the night, coming in fitful gusts,&#xD;
that jarred the little cottage and made every timber crack-&#xD;
filling' all with the fear of an approaching storm. Sunday&#xD;
morning the wind rushed and roared over the Island, blinding&#xD;
its temporary inhabitants with clouds of sand. About ten&#xD;
o'clock in the morning it blew a perfect hurricane, and all&#xD;
felt the tread and howl of the storm-god, and looked wildly&#xD;
around for help and safety. Agnes clung instinctively to the&#xD;
Hermit. The steamboat "Star" that plied between the Is-&#xD;
land and Bayou Beouf had arrived outside the bar early on&#xD;
Sunday morning, but the water was too low for her a~ that&#xD;
tune to cross the bar. Col. Clarkson was anxious to get&#xD;
aboard ~of her with his family, but there was no safe access.&#xD;
The storm soon came on with all its fury, and the steamer&#xD;
was floated across the bar near the door of the hotel. The&#xD;
Hermit urged Col. Clarkson to carry his family to the hotel,&#xD;
and, if possible, pass thence to the boat; but the rage of the&#xD;
tempest was such that it seemed like certain destruction to&#xD;
attempt it, ~rnd he shrank back appalled at the thought. The&#xD;
Hermit, however, seized Agnes, and, though blinded by the&#xD;
rain and deafened by the roar, he breasted the storm, and'&#xD;
reached the hotel in safety, followed by the negro man, Abe-&#xD;
whom (Jlarkson had kept near his person since he rescued him&#xD;
from the flood-..~bearing in his arms two of his master's children.&#xD;
The scene of terror and alarm at the hotel was heyoi~md de-&#xD;
scription. The chimneys of the steamer were blown away,&#xD;
and she threatened to be capsized and blown out to sea, to&#xD;
avoid which anchors were dropped, an4 all her oabiii~ and&#xD;

&#xD;
upper tiihbcrs were cut away. By the fury of the storm t~e&#xD;
waters were heaped up between the Island and the mainland,&#xD;
and upon their return, driven from the shore, the mad sca&#xD;
rushed over the Island. To avoid the rush of the waters, the&#xD;
terrified guests betook themselves to the upper rooms of the&#xD;
hotel. While there, a crash and wild cry, that rose above the&#xD;
thunder and rattle of the storm, drew all to the windows. A&#xD;
cottage, with its inmates, was seen borne upon the bo~om of&#xD;
the flood and buried in the Gulf. The terrified occupants of&#xD;
other cottages rushed out and attempted to reach the hotel,&#xD;
and were washed away. Crash succeeded crash, and house&#xD;
after house yielded to the pressure of the storm and ~ind,&#xD;
and tumbled to pieces, or were borne away by the w yes.&#xD;
Col. Clarkson felt his cottage shaking under him, and ex-&#xD;
pected every moment it would go. His remaining chil ren&#xD;
and servants were lashed to such articles of furniture a he&#xD;
hoped might be sufficient to buoy them up above the wa es,&#xD;
should the storm carry away the cottage. The presence of&#xD;
mind of his wife amid the wild confusion was extraordin ry.&#xD;
Every precaution was taken by her that could be to secure&#xD;
their safety. A sudden dash of wind Oarried away the roof&#xD;
of the house, killing one of the servants by a falling piece&#xD;
of timber. The other servants and children were borne off&#xD;
and Mr. and Mrs. Clarkson seizedhold of a heavy piece of float-&#xD;
ing timber and lashed themselves to it by means of strong strips&#xD;
of cloth, prepared by Mrs. Clarkson for that purpose. Agnes&#xD;
saw her parents float off with the wreck of the cottage,&#xD;
screamed, and fell back into the arms of the 1-hermit. A&#xD;
tremendous crash, and the cry, "The hotel is going !" caused&#xD;
a simultaneous rush to the basement. It was barely reached&#xD;
when the upper story was blown away, and the water rushed&#xD;
into the lower rooms. The scene that followed was awful.&#xD;
The deafening roar of the sea, the howl of the free winds,&#xD;
the fierce glare of the lightning, the torrent of falling rain, the&#xD;
&#xD;
PLAYING    FOIL AMUSEMENT.            28T&#xD;
upheaving of the billows, the wrecks of houses, and the cry&#xD;
of men, women, and children, clinging for life to the floating&#xD;
timbers, presented a scene of the awfully sublime, such as&#xD;
few ever witnessed, and none who witnessed it can think of&#xD;
without a shudder and an involuiXtary invocation to the great&#xD;
God of the tempest and sunshine. It was evident to all that&#xD;
the remnant of the hotel, where the terrified survivors of the&#xD;
storm found temporary foothold , could not much longer with-&#xD;
stand the combined force of the mad elements. The hull of&#xD;
the steamer lying neai~ the door, fast anchored and nearly&#xD;
buried, alone promised to outride the storm; and thither t~.e&#xD;
attention of the apparently doomed ones was directed: the&#xD;
distance was short, but the passage~ perilous to a degree that&#xD;
made the stoutest hesitate. It was a grand sight, amidst that&#xD;
terrified group, to see the stern gray-haired old Hermit, with&#xD;
bared head, face the tempest. lie looked indeed like ~t.&#xD;
very sea-god, and all turned instinctively to him for aid and&#xD;
counsel. When it became evident that the hull of the&#xD;
steamer offered the only hope of safety, he caught up Agnes&#xD;
as if she had been a child, and bore her in safety to the&#xD;
wreck. his example was quickly followed by others, but in&#xD;
si~ch haste and confusion that great numbers lost their bal-&#xD;
ance and were washed away. He strove to establish some-&#xD;
thing like order, and performed prodigies of strength, as did&#xD;
others who were sufficiently self-possessed to act with judg-&#xD;
ment. There was only one moment when he manifested any&#xD;
thing like human emotion. The living had been swept from&#xD;
his side, falling timbers had prqstrated others, mothers gath-&#xD;
bred around and prayed him to save their childi~en, husbands&#xD;
to save their wives, and children their parents, and amid all&#xD;
he acted like a man of iron, helping where help could avail,&#xD;
but as deaf to cries and clamor as to the roar of the storm;&#xD;
but he had noticed an old man, about his age and make, who,&#xD;
like himself had exe~ted every energy to save the frightened~&#xD;

guests, and had crossed at the imminent peril of his life&#xD;
some dozen or more times the fearful passage, each time&#xD;
hearing one or more persons too timid or too feeble to at-&#xD;
tempt it alone; and at last, in endeavoring to convey a~ lady&#xD;
across, missed his step, and, with the lady, was borne off into&#xD;
the boiling surge. The old man's eyes swank and the mus-&#xD;
cles of his face trembled as he saw his companion in danger&#xD;
and deeds of daring borne away by the revengeful flood, as if&#xD;
in rage at the numbers he had rescued from its liquid eni-&#xD;
brace. Among those who perished in their charitable efforts&#xD;
to save and rescue the timid was ~he faithful negro man Abe,&#xD;
who had \struggled like a hero, and exhibited a contempt of&#xD;
danger and death to sav~ the holpiess that shamed many a&#xD;
white face. His deeds will be told over by many a mother&#xD;
to her offspring, both saved' by his brawny arm. He did not&#xD;
perish' until he had saved the two children of his master,&#xD;
taken by him from the cottage.&#xD;
Between two and three hundred of Louisiana's bravest&#xD;
sons and most beautiful daughters in one short day found a&#xD;
watery grave, where' but the day before all was hope and&#xD;
f'estiv~lty! Not a tenement was left upon the Island.&#xD;
The suffering upon the hull of the steamer, where the sur-&#xD;
vivors were huddled together, was truly appalling. They re-&#xD;
mained there in an unsheltered, famishing condition all the&#xD;
succeeding night, and thQ next day and night, before relief&#xD;
came.&#xD;
Vessels were sent out in search of those who might have&#xD;
saved themselves by clinging to falling timbers, and numbers&#xD;
were found and picked up. Agnes, who had been conveyed&#xD;
with the others to Berwick's Bay, waited until her heart&#xD;
grew sick and faint, hoping to hear that her father and&#xD;
mother were among those thus saved. But in vain: no&#xD;
tidings of them were had. The remains of her brother and&#xD;
sister who perished were found and recognized. A parcel&#xD;
&#xD;
Ps&#xD;
&#xD;
of wreckers, semi-pirates, who infested a portion of the coast&#xD;
and Island, had visited the scene of disaster in search of&#xD;
plunder, and had stripped such of the dead as were left upon&#xD;
the Island of every thing by which their friends might recog-&#xD;
nize thenf, and it was only in rare instances that the recov*&#xD;
ered bodies could be known by their surviving friends.&#xD;
Each day Agnes would walk upon the beach, and look&#xD;
longingly out upon the ndw quiet Gulf; as if expecting to&#xD;
welcome 'her sea-washed parents from the embrace of the&#xD;
mermaid, and would turn disappointed a'~vay, and, with sad&#xD;
heart and weary step, return to the hotel in company with&#xD;
the Hermit. As she was about leaving for hon~c, Robert&#xD;
Hamilton stepped unexpectedly into her apartment. She&#xD;
threw herself into his arms, and both wept in silence to-&#xD;
gether. He at last said:&#xD;
"I see you are prepared for your journey home. Go; I&#xD;
have heard all. The kind friend who has already done so&#xD;
much for you will see you home, and II will' stay and search&#xD;
the coast and Gulf; and not leave off until I restore their dear&#xD;
remains to you, or all hopes of a recovery of them are gone."&#xD;
"0, Robert! Robert I" she said, with her in~iploring face&#xD;
turned to his. "The sight of you has revived the hope al-&#xD;
most dead at my heart that I shall again see my dear, dear&#xD;
parents. 0, they cannot be lost! they cannot be lost! Some-&#xD;
thing here "-pressing her hand upon her heart-" tells me&#xD;
they are not lost. 0, my God! my God! spare a bended reed!&#xD;
Leave to me this hope-the sweet hope that I shall again see&#xD;
my parents. 0 God! I bend to thee, I bend to thee; break&#xD;
not the bended reed! 0, may I see my parents once more,&#xD;
once more! 0, my sad heart, it will break, it will break!&#xD;
What shall I do? 0, what shall I do? Will not some kind&#xD;
angel guard and save my parents, my dear father, my blessed&#xD;
mother ?"&#xD;
"Yes, my daughter, yes," whispered the Hermit.&#xD;

She gave him a wild, anxious, searching look, lie looked&#xD;
abstractedly in her face, and said in a husky voice, "Yes,&#xD;
yes," without apparently being conscious of what he said.&#xD;
She sprang forward, threw her arms around his neck, and&#xD;
emptied into his broad bosom the flood that seemed~drowning&#xD;
her heart. He immediately repented what he had said, and&#xD;
was astonished at the act. When he said it he believed it to&#xD;
be true, but the feeling left him as he felt the clasp of the&#xD;
young girl's arms around his neck, and he reproached liim~&#xD;
self for having inspired a hope his better judgment told him&#xD;
must be vain. He could not explain ~o himself why he had&#xD;
done a thing which seemed s~ unwarrantable, and which for the&#xD;
moment felt like reality, but which vanished ahnost with the&#xD;
sound of his voice. The thought of the terrible reaction&#xD;
whi~h Would take place when the hope thus incautiously in-&#xD;
spired should be succeeded by despair, gave him the keenest&#xD;
sense of pain.&#xD;
No persuasion of Hamilton or the Hermit could induce&#xD;
Agnes to leave until the search for her parents proved suc-&#xD;
cessful, or should be abandoned.&#xD;
Vessels dotted the Gulf and bay in every direction in search&#xD;
of the missing, and every nook and obscure corner of the&#xD;
coast and bay were searched by smaller craft, but all in vain.&#xD;
Morning after morning caihe, but brought no tidings to&#xD;
Agnes.&#xD;
Colonel Clarkson and his wife were borne off by the waves&#xD;
with the piece of timber to which they had lashed them-&#xD;
selves, and, left to the mercy of the winds, they were blown'&#xD;
far out to sea, beyond the range of the vessels sent in search&#xD;
of the missing. When the storm lulled, they were floated by&#xD;
the refluent waves in toward the land, but out of sigl~t~of the&#xD;
vessels and friends in search of them. All Sunday night,&#xD;
Monday, Tuesday, and Tuesday night they were buffeted by&#xD;
the sea. Their thirst and hunger were inexpressibly great.&#xD;
&#xD;
290&#xD;
&#xD;
He bore it less patiently than his wife, and begged her to&#xD;
loose him from the timber and let them go down together,&#xD;
but the true and brave woman encouraged him to patience&#xD;
and resignation. They were finally cast ashore a short dis-&#xD;
tance up a small bayou. Clarkson was almost entirely dis-&#xD;
abled: his limbs were stiffened and swollen, and he was&#xD;
powerless to help himself:, and his wife was barely able to&#xD;
move about. The country around them was flat and marshy,&#xD;
and their only chance of final rescue was that of being seen&#xD;
and picked up by some one passing along the bayou. They&#xD;
could see the vessels far out' in the Gulf in search of them,&#xD;
but could do nothing~ to attract attention. They saw the skiff&#xD;
of Robert pass up the bayou and~ retlirn, and were unable to&#xD;
make noise enough to attract his attention, though tliey did&#xD;
not at the time know who was in the skiff, nor that it was in&#xD;
search of them. They subsisted upon buds, and such craw-&#xD;
fish and frogs as Mrs. Clarkson could catch, he being en-&#xD;
tirely unable to help himself. When they saw the skiff&#xD;
pass, and were unable to make themselves heard or seen, Mr.&#xD;
Clarkson despaired, and was detected by his wife in an effort&#xD;
to cut his throat with his pocket-knife. When interrupted&#xD;
by her, and the knife wrested from him, he begged to be&#xD;
led into the water, where th~y might perish together. She&#xD;
rebuked and exhorted him to patience and resignation.&#xD;
Knowing that the skiff would pass near them on its re-&#xD;
turn, she tore a width from the skirt of her dress and&#xD;
fastened it to a bush which she could shake, and by means&#xD;
of which she hoped to attract attention; but before the&#xD;
return of the skiff, some fishermen-an old man and his&#xD;
son-chanced to pass down, and, seeing the signal, took&#xD;
them in their scow and furnished them with food and fresh&#xD;
water, and started with them to their anxious friends.&#xD;
Hamilton in returning overtook th'em, and hastened to bear&#xD;
the welcome intelligence to Agnes. Her joy was as wild&#xD;

as her grief. She flew to them and nestled close to them&#xD;
like some fond birding. She could not speak; she felt&#xD;
too much for words. Nor did she forget the wants of these&#xD;
loved parents who had suffered such anguish upon the&#xD;
waters. It was affecting to see - how patiently she bore the&#xD;
fretting of her sick and disabled father, and how unwearily&#xD;
she tended her worn-out but brave mother. Colonel Clark-&#xD;
son had lost almost entirely the use of his limbs; and his&#xD;
temper, which had always been so placid, was as irascible and&#xD;
fretful as an infant's. Mrs. Clarkson was nearly bald. The&#xD;
sea water had matted her long luxuriant hair, and the pain&#xD;
was so intolerable that she had managed to saw it off with&#xD;
her husband's pocket-knife whilst lying in the bayou.&#xD;
The ilermit was so overcome when the news of their re-&#xD;
covery reached him, that he buried his face in his hands, and&#xD;
the large tears forced themselves through his fingers.&#xD;

fulness and peevisl~ness made him a very di~eult patient to&#xD;
nurse. Agnes an the rest of the family, including Robert&#xD;
and the Hermit, were all attention. His sufferings had evi-&#xD;
dently, to some extent, impaired his mind, and made him&#xD;
harsh and exacting towards his family, and especially so&#xD;
towards the wife who had braved with him the dangers of&#xD;
the tempest, and borne so patiently the cravings of hunger&#xD;
and thirst.&#xD;
As soon as he was sufficiently recovered to travel, they&#xD;
started homeward. In passing New Orleans, they engaged a&#xD;
physician to accompany them to the plantation, where they&#xD;
went in preference to their residence in the city, as the sickly&#xD;
season was not entirely past, and the yellow fever had pre-&#xD;
vailed there the year previous. The attention of the doctor,&#xD;
for a few days after their airival home, was directed exclu-&#xD;
sively to Col. Clarkson; but he chanced one day to notice the&#xD;

&#xD;
appearance of the Hermit as he passed through the sick-&#xD;
room, and was struck by the appearance of bodily suffering&#xD;
visible upon his face, and, turning to him, said:&#xD;
"My dear sii~ you need my services far more than my&#xD;
patient here, whose sufferings-I beg his pardon for saying&#xD;
so-are to some extent imaginary."&#xD;
This remark directed the attention of all to the Hermit,&#xD;
and they were surprised and pained to note the lines which&#xD;
suffering and disease had made, without their having observed&#xD;
it. They had thought only of the one who, by his com~&#xD;
plaints, had drawn attention to himself. It was so unusual&#xD;
for Col. Clarkson to be sick, and still more for him to fret&#xD;
and complain, that they had been absorbed by their sympathy&#xD;
fot and attention to him, and had not thought of others.&#xD;
He, too, turned and looked at his old friend; and the change&#xD;
was such,* that he sprang up from the lounge upon which he&#xD;
lay with bandaged feet, and, despite the twinge which shot&#xD;
through his limbs as he put his feet heavily to the floor, ho&#xD;
approached the Hermit, and said&#xD;
"My dear friend, and the saviour of my child, have you&#xD;
been thus uncomplainingly suffering, with disease~ ,~eding&#xD;
upon your life, while I have absorbed.the attention of all by&#xD;
my childish complaints and frettino~? You must let the doc-&#xD;
tor prescribe for you, and we will all nurse you."&#xD;
Agnes crept close to him, and, kneeling down by the chair&#xD;
in which he had seated himself gave expression, by look and&#xD;
moan, t~ the deep feeling of sympathy which she felt for his&#xD;
sufferings, and a full acknowledgment of the double debt of&#xD;
gratitude she owed him; and, at the same time, by her man-&#xD;
ner, expressed her pain and, mortification that his sufferings&#xD;
should have so long escaped her notice.&#xD;
"Never mind, my darling," said he; "you have nothing&#xD;
to reproach yourself with. Yori have been used to regard&#xD;
me as exempt from pain-something beyond human suffer~&#xD;
&#xD;
ing and, disease; and I have thought so too. For thirty&#xD;
years, I have not been subject to the ills and infirmities to&#xD;
which flesh is heir. It is changed no~~ The cord of life&#xD;
is loosening; my office tenure is nearly out."&#xD;
"0 di not talk so! do not talk so, my kind friend I"&#xD;
"Do not distress yourself: it is a pleasure rather than a&#xD;
pain to me that life is loosing its hold upon me. I have little&#xD;
to bind me here, and much to draw me to the home of the&#xD;
/ blessed beyond the floods and casualties of this life. And&#xD;
do not, I beseech you, make bitter the only cup which I have&#xD;
longed to drink, by unavailing sorrow at the prospect of my&#xD;
departure. I can be of no more service to you; so let me&#xD;
pass, without regret, to embrace those who have long waited&#xD;
my coming. I knew my course was run when your parents&#xD;
were recovered from the Island wreck. I had then nothing&#xD;
further left for me to do; and my days since have been only&#xD;
so many steps downward."&#xD;
"0! you will live, and be spared to us yet many years I"&#xD;
"Not so, my child. Would you know why I have been&#xD;
from the first so drawn to you? My life has been all&#xD;
thought and feeling, and in you I found a sympathy which I&#xD;
did not see in others; and it secured you a place in my&#xD;
withered heart, which you have warmed by your innocence&#xD;
and love. Let the thought of the* little sunshine you have&#xD;
given to the evening of my life console you for the loss you&#xD;
may feel when I am gone."&#xD;
Agnes and all tried to dissuade him from such thoughts,&#xD;
and to think of life rather than death; and the doctor said:&#xD;
"You are mistaken, my old friend: you will outlive us all&#xD;
yet."&#xD;
"I am not mistaken, Doctor, and your looks tell me that&#xD;
you know I am not. The springs of life are all dried up,&#xD;
and I experience a giving way of the vital functions which&#xD;
warns me that my end is nigh. My dear girl," turning to&#xD;

Agnes, "like the mistletoe, you l~ave added a little verdure&#xD;
to an old dried trunk; but it was. not native growth, and the&#xD;
hare trunk must, go. It was once a pleasure to think that&#xD;
when the summons should come, there would be none left to&#xD;
drop a tear on my coffin, or follow my remains to the grave,&#xD;
save ~the two old companions of my solitude. But I am self-&#xD;
ish enough to feel a melancholy gratification that one so pure&#xD;
and good as you, will some timesthink kindly of inc when I&#xD;
am gone."&#xD;
At their earnest solicitation he consented to take whatever&#xD;
prescription the doctor might offer him; but no persuasion&#xD;
could prev~dl upon him to remain at Col. Clarkson's house.&#xD;
lie persisted in his determination to return to his oWn hum-&#xD;
ble cottage. The next day he was unable to make his accus-&#xD;
tomed visit to Col. Clarkson. The latter, feeling deeply re-&#xD;
buked by the Hermit's uncomplaining course, an&amp;amp; grieved&#xD;
that he should have been th~ means of diverting attention&#xD;
from the greater sufferer, threw off his lethargy; and, though&#xD;
the effort cost him considerable pain, walked with his wife to&#xD;
the Hermit's cottage.. They found ~him in bedunable to be&#xD;
up. What kind nursing could do to alleviate pain, and ward&#xD;
of the stroke of death, was done. Mrs. Clarkson, whose full&#xD;
woman's heart flowed out to him for having twice restored to&#xD;
her her child, was assiduous in her attentions to him. He&#xD;
had a powerful 'frame, and, like a solid fortress, it yielded&#xD;
slowly to the enemy. The gray of autumn set in, and he&#xD;
still lay upon his bed, with the kind and ever attentive&#xD;
nurses about him. The leaves of~ the china trees which&#xD;
shaded his yard and house had all turned that pale and beau-&#xD;
tiful yellow which precedes their fall; and, at each gentle&#xD;
rustle of the autumn wind, would leave the stem, and flutter&#xD;
in clouds to the ground, falling 'as soft as snow-flakes, and&#xD;
producing a singularly sad, pleasing sensation, that forced&#xD;
upon the mind thQughts of decay and death. One such&#xD;

&#xD;
afternoon, he motioned Agnes to approach him, and asked&#xD;
her to hand him a little casket that lay upon a table near the&#xD;
foot of his bed. From it he took a manuscript, carefully&#xD;
rolled up, and, looking~ at Mrs, Clarkson, said:&#xD;
"It was with no desire to write a tale, or to interest any&#xD;
one in my history, nor to excuse my unproductive and soil'-&#xD;
tary life, that I have penned this sketch of myself. I did&#xD;
it because I knew you must have some desire to know&#xD;
who I am, and why I am thus, and you are entitled to have&#xD;
that desire gratified. . My end draws near, and I would hear&#xD;
you read it. I have a human weakness to be known to those&#xD;
I love and who love me, before I go. Please read ;" handing&#xD;
the manuscript to Agnes.&#xD;
It was a severe task for* Agnes, in her agitated state of&#xD;
mind, to comply with his request; but she did so, and, rally-&#xD;
ing her energies, read:&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
"A blossom full of promise is life's joy,&#xD;
That never comes to fruit."&#xD;
THE HER IT' S HISTORY.&#xD;
M~ father, David Stani y, was an unpretending planter&#xD;
in one of the southern~ or middle counties of Mississippi.&#xD;
My parents were both pious people of the Baptist persuasion,&#xD;
and resided near a country hurch where the different Chris-&#xD;
tian denominations of the ewly settled country, Methodist,&#xD;
Baptist, and Presbyterian, preached once in each month.&#xD;
My father was one of the ear iest settlers in the neighborhood,&#xD;
and had moved there when I was quite a child. When I was&#xD;
twelve or fourteen years of' age, the neighborhood was thickly&#xD;
settled by small planters and farmers, each owning his home-&#xD;
stead and stock, some a few negroes, and others a good many&#xD;
more. This was before the speculations which prostrated the&#xD;
energies. ~f the State and ruined its morals. At that time&#xD;
the society was moral, and good schools were abundant and&#xD;
well patronized, and the largest fiospitality and best social&#xD;
feeling prevailed.' My father was the wealthiest planter in&#xD;
the neighborhood, and his house, though rough, was large&#xD;
and roomy, and his hospitality unbounded, and his home be-&#xD;
came a resort for all the young people. in the neighborhood,&#xD;
more particularly upon Church days. I had an older brother,&#xD;
&#xD;
and also a sister older than myself. At the time I speak oft,&#xD;
my brother was twenty-three years of age, and my sister seven-&#xD;
teen, and were both fond of company, and were good eques-&#xD;
trians. My tastes were different. Society was distasteful to&#xD;
me, though it was always a pleasure to see company at my&#xD;
father's house. When the young people would gather there,&#xD;
and make the house, and woods, and orchards vocal with&#xD;
their boisterous glee, I would take my dog and Amos, my&#xD;
faithful old serving-man, then a lad, and wander through the&#xD;
fields and woods, or along the brook that watered the large&#xD;
pasture-ground. Game was abundant, but I had no desire&#xD;
to kill it. I delighted to see the wild deer bound free through&#xD;
the grand old woods, and felt a pang when one was shot&#xD;
down, and its beseeching eyes rolled in search of sympathy&#xD;
and help. I was enthusiastically attached to my sister, and&#xD;
loved my mother with a feeling akin to idolatry. I would&#xD;
sit for hours and watch her at her needlework. At such&#xD;
times I had no wis~h to talk, II only wanted to think. I did&#xD;
not care to be wjth her when others were present. I had the&#xD;
sam~ feeling with regard to my sister. I loved to see her&#xD;
admired and courted, and when none others were by I sought&#xD;
her company, and would listen to her voice as she would talk,&#xD;
sing, and read, with a music in her tone and accent that al-&#xD;
ways charmed me. At such times I was silent; if another&#xD;
joined us I would walk off; though I was never jealous. I&#xD;
did not then nor do I know now the feeling of jealousy. I&#xD;
could think of her, look at her, and listen to her clear, ringing,&#xD;
happy laugh, just as well removed a little from her as when&#xD;
nearer.&#xD;
The family for a long time thought me lacking in that&#xD;
spirit and resolution which characterized both branches of&#xD;
my family, but upon one occasion I chanced to hear a gentle-&#xD;
man make a light remark about my sister-something about&#xD;
her being heartless, a coquette, or something of that sort-&#xD;

&#xD;
and the fierce, demon-like spring which I made upon him,&#xD;
and clawed his face and tore his bosom, startled everybody,&#xD;
and not only removed the fear of a want of proper spirit, but&#xD;
caused great anxiety on my account on the part of my mother.&#xD;
It gave to her a knowledge of m-y character, which enabled&#xD;
her to shape her lessons so as to weed out passions and nox-&#xD;
ious thoughts which might otherwise have been my bane .~&#xD;
never joined the gay cavalcades formed by the young people.&#xD;
I had no wish to join in them, yet I loved to see them.&#xD;
Horseback was almost the only mode of conveyance in the&#xD;
country at that time, and men and women were of necessity&#xD;
good riders; my sister was particularly so, and it afforded me&#xD;
the intensest pleasure to see her in her beautiful, close-fitting&#xD;
riding-habit, and graceful little cap, with long drooping&#xD;
feather, vault into the saddle and bound off, with heart as&#xD;
light and free as her horse's heels. She always understood&#xD;
me; my brother never did, though I never censured him; in-&#xD;
deed, I never thought of it.&#xD;
After a time, more wealthy planters and speculators began&#xD;
to move in and buy up the smaller farms, and to open large&#xD;
plantations. The felling of the forest and the breaking up&#xD;
of the virgin soil occasioned a decay of vegetable matter,&#xD;
which prodi~ced annually congestive chills and fevers, which&#xD;
carried off a large number of the population, and a~nong&#xD;
others, within a few weeks of each other, my mother, brother,&#xD;
and sister, leaving~ my father and myself to weep over their&#xD;
graves, and mour~i that we could not accompany them. Ii&#xD;
hardly know h6w ii survived this utter wreck a~d ruin of my&#xD;
every earthly feeli pg and hope! The void, the vacancy about&#xD;
the heart, can be i!lnderstood only by those who have felt it.&#xD;
Even now, when all is wilted about me and my very muscles&#xD;
are dry and hard!, and time's ploughshare has made deep&#xD;
furrows on my then smooth face, my heart cleaves closer to&#xD;
my side as I draw the veil which time has flung over my&#xD;
&#xD;
301&#xD;
&#xD;
long-buried grief. The blow was equally heavy upon my&#xD;
father. His all was gone. We were the last of our race.&#xD;
I had been told of a female cousin, bpt my father had never&#xD;
been able to ascertain if she were livin~; and, of a large family,&#xD;
my father and myself only remained. My silent, thoughtful&#xD;
life had made me secondary with him to his other children.&#xD;
In his plans and hopes for the future I was not included, ex-&#xD;
cept as an object to be provided for. In my older brother&#xD;
all his hopes for the family and its success had been centered.&#xD;
It was long before he rallied sufficiently to consider what had&#xD;
best be done with me. He thought it advisable to send me&#xD;
to college, and yielded to the persuasiofl of an old friend of&#xD;
his, who had disposed of his place and negroes in Mississippi&#xD;
and settled in one of the Western States, to place me under&#xD;
his guardianship, to be sent to a new and flourishing college,&#xD;
in the village in which he lived. Thither I was accord ugly&#xD;
taken'. The village was a quiet and orderly place, and the&#xD;
school as good as a new and only partially endowed college&#xD;
could be. The, teachers were kind, and I was well satisfied&#xD;
with my situation.&#xD;
The change of scene and formation of new acquaintances&#xD;
by degrees blunted the edge of my grief, and I became as&#xD;
cheerful and lighthearted as others. I was contented; I be-&#xD;
lieve I was happy, if a perfectly inactive state of feeling&#xD;
and sentiment could be called happiness. If I did well or ill,&#xD;
it was not from a desire to do either, for I am not conscious&#xD;
of ever having foi~med a design of any kind. I acted by the&#xD;
mere force of chance. If I behaved virtuously, as I believe&#xD;
I did, I deserved no credit for it, as it, was done without&#xD;
thought, and because I had formed no vicious habit, and&#xD;
hence was not tempted to do wrong~ To those whose. society&#xD;
* was agreeable to me, I was a favorite, for I was never moody,&#xD;
always cheerful, and preferred tojisten rather tl~an talk; and&#xD;
those whose society was unpleasant to xue, I avoided rather&#xD;

by instinct than by design, and hei~ce never gave them of-&#xD;
fence. Though often invited, I never attended any of the&#xD;
parties given in town, nor for some time extended my ac-&#xD;
quaintance beyond the family of m~ guardian. Being from&#xD;
the South, and having the reputation of great wealth, I was&#xD;
much caressed both in the college and by persons in town,&#xD;
though such a thing never occurred to inc at the time. Upon&#xD;
one occasion I was invited by the young lady who lived at&#xD;
the house of my guardian-a ward and relative of hi~-to an&#xD;
evening party given by her at his house. I did not think of&#xD;
going at first, but my roommate, the 'only other young man&#xD;
in the college who had been invited, insisted upon it, as he&#xD;
was anxious to be introduced to the family, and would not go&#xD;
without me. The company was small and select, and among&#xD;
the guests was Miss Jessie Stanhope. How I became intro-&#xD;
duced to her, and why I gave my exclusive attention to her&#xD;
and how I chanced to accompany h6r home, I do not know,&#xD;
and did not then, but such was the case~ Whether I danced,&#xD;
or whether I talked, or who was there, and what was done&#xD;
three days afterwards, I could not have told. If I left her&#xD;
during the evening, I do not know it; if I slighted others, I&#xD;
do not kiiow it; if we were the subject of remark, I do not&#xD;
and did not know it, nor did I think of such a thing. I only&#xD;
know that my heart before I[ went there was vacant, empty,&#xD;
except memories which would sometimes crowd upon me in&#xD;
my moments of solitude, and she filled it. There was no cx-&#xD;
citement, no fire in the sentiment she, inspired, but a quiet,&#xD;
tranquil, satisfied feeling, a revival of the feeling covered by&#xD;
the grave-clothes that shrouded the loved form of a lost sis-&#xD;
ter, with an additioAal feeling which I did not understand,&#xD;
but which added to the pleasure which her society gave me.&#xD;
She was the only lady except my mother and sister that I was&#xD;
conscious of ever having thought about. Why in all my evening&#xD;
walks afterwards I should pass the house at ~hi~h she was&#xD;
&#xD;
302&#xD;
&#xD;
303&#xD;
&#xD;
staying, I never asked myself; and never thought of it. Tier&#xD;
father was dead, and herself and mother were staying with&#xD;
her uncle, an old childless widower. The house was a large&#xD;
three-story brick building, containing four immense parlors&#xD;
on the lower floor, with a large wide hall, with high ceiling,&#xD;
dividing the two suites of rooms. The parlors on each side&#xD;
were provided with folding-doors, which were thrown open on&#xD;
grand occasions. They were expensively furnished, and ex-&#xD;
actly alike. The owner was vain of his folly, and fond of&#xD;
displaying it to visitors. He had been acquainted with my&#xD;
father in early life, when but a poor man, and was anxious to&#xD;
make an exhibition of his finery to me, and had often before&#xD;
my acquaintance with his niece pressed me to visit him and&#xD;
look at his house, but which I had declined from indifference,&#xD;
and not from a disinclination to afford him an opportunity of&#xD;
gratifying his pride. Now, however, my visits were as often&#xD;
as he could desire. From going once a week, I increased it&#xD;
to twice, three times, and from that to every evening, and&#xD;
spent my Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays in the company&#xD;
of his niece. ,Whether my attentions to her were remarked&#xD;
by others never occurred to me; I wanted to go, and I went,&#xD;
and was satisfied when there, and was rcsdess when away. If&#xD;
I found visitors there, and I could not have her all to myself,&#xD;
I went away. A month or six weeks from the date of my&#xD;
first introduction, our intimacy was such that as soon as my&#xD;
foot sounded upon the pavement, she would leave other com-&#xD;
pany and bound forward to meet me, and, arm in arm, or, zis&#xD;
often happened, our arms around each other like brother and.&#xD;
sister, we would walk the garden, or, seated upon thG stone-&#xD;
sill under the high projecting portico, the roof of which was&#xD;
sustained by large tall pillars of the iDoric order, and holding&#xD;
each other's hand, the swift hours passed away9 Whether&#xD;
she was beautiful or not never occurred to me; I do not think&#xD;
I looked at her face-~at 'least I am not now conscious of&#xD;

aving over done so. That I had looked into and through&#xD;
Ii r face at the soul that shone in it, and gave-it life and ox-&#xD;
p session, a thousand times, and gazed li]~e one entranced, is&#xD;
tr e; butl never marked or noticed an outward feature. In&#xD;
t is state of utter obliviousness to every thing but the object&#xD;
o my idolatry, between seven and nine months glided Un-&#xD;
c nsciously away. The first thing that broke the happy&#xD;
re cry was a letter from my father, informing me of his inten-&#xD;
tion to remove me after the spring session to one of the older&#xD;
colleges in the Eastern States, and selected Yale. I showed&#xD;
the letter to Jessie, and the thought of separation pained us&#xD;
both. We had never talked love, never lighted faith, had&#xD;
~aever thought of doing so, or that such a thing was common.&#xD;
It no more occurred to me to "make love to her," in the or-&#xD;
dinary acceptation of that term, than to a sister or an angel.&#xD;
Th~.t we were to live and love, and be all to each other, was&#xD;
understood as a thing of course, and neither thought nor&#xD;
asked for vows. No promises were given, and none asked-.&#xD;
i~one were needed. Our hearts were bound by a web stronger&#xD;
than words could weave. That we wei~e always to be to each&#xD;
other what we were was a thing of course, as much so as that&#xD;
a mother would always love and cherish her offspring.&#xD;
Some time previous to the receipt of the letter, her uncle,&#xD;
an unjust, capricious man, from some affront, real or imaginary,&#xD;
offered. him by Mrs. Stanhope, intimated that she had kept&#xD;
house for him long enough, and she purchased a small cottage&#xD;
in the edge of the town, with a piece of woodland and a neat&#xD;
pretty garden attached, into which she and her daughter&#xD;
went to reside, and were residing there when I received the&#xD;
letter from my father.&#xD;
A short time before I left we wandered through the green&#xD;
woods and culled the wild rose and other spring flowers to-&#xD;
gether, and talked of when my education would be finished&#xD;
and we meet again; it would take three years at Yale to&#xD;
&#xD;
complete the course of study, and three years was to be the&#xD;
time of my exile. That Ii should b~ back three~years from&#xD;
the day of my departure was as certain as that I would return&#xD;
home at the close of my college course.&#xD;
I prolonged my stay in the village as rong after the close&#xD;
of the college exercises as I could-o~iving myself only time&#xD;
to get to Yale at the opening of the session. The day of my&#xD;
leave-taking at last came. Jessie and I walked the garden&#xD;
and sat upon the door-step as we had done a thousar~d times&#xD;
before. In the little parlor I bade good-bye to Mrs. Stanhope.&#xD;
She gave me her blessing and went weeping from the room.&#xD;
Jessie walked to the door, leaned her head upon my shoulder,&#xD;
her long curls sweeping about her face and neck. Our tears&#xD;
mingled, as did our feelings and hearts. All I could say was&#xD;
to whisper in a choking voice, "Three years, three years, I&#xD;
shall be back." I pressed a kiss upon her forehead and tore&#xD;
myself away. The cottage was situated at the head of an&#xD;
avenue, a ~ialf or three quarters of a mile long; at the-end&#xD;
of it I turned and saw her, as when I left, leaning against the&#xD;
door-facing.&#xD;
I had consented some time previous to act as groomsman&#xD;
to a young college-mate upon that ~wening, not knowing at&#xD;
the time I consented to do so that it would be my last evening&#xD;
with Jessie and her mother. When I found that such would&#xD;
be the case, I asked to be excused from serving, but the young&#xD;
man was of the humble class of collegiate, and I saw that he&#xD;
was likely to misunderstand my motive in wishing to be re-&#xD;
leased from my engagement, and I could not avoid wounding&#xD;
his feelings without a full explanation-which I was unwill-&#xD;
ing to give-and so fulfilled my promise to him.&#xD;
After the wedding, I remained all night at the residence&#xD;
of the bride's father. The next morning a widower, brother-&#xD;
in-law of my friend, and an inmate of the house where I?&#xD;
boarded, came running in with great glee, calling out, "A&#xD;

meet, it can be restored to its companions.&#xD;
0, how sad and lonely I feel! and what a long, dreary three&#xD;
years stretch their length out before me! I try and try, but&#xD;
cannot look to the end! It fades into confused obscurity.&#xD;
A broad, 'shaded and straight lane seems to open before me as&#xD;
I strain my thoughts and eyes to the future, but it is short,&#xD;
and a little beyond it is clouded and confused. 0 that the&#xD;
confusion would break away and I could look down the path,&#xD;
the long avenue to the future! You do not kn&amp;amp;w how sad&#xD;
it makes me. Is it ominous? Kind angels forbid! It is&#xD;
foolish in me to write thusbut I feel so sad. The fancy I&#xD;
know arises from the confusion of every thing as I watched&#xD;
you pass down the avenu* to-day. A film covered my eyes,&#xD;
and as you moved fartlwr down the avenue, every thing grew&#xD;
confused. I could see you going, going, going, but all swam'&#xD;
before me, and I could distinguish nothing clearly. This, I&#xD;
am sure, caused the distressing fancy which torments me as I&#xD;
try to look forward through three years of time. I ought&#xD;
not to trouble you with such things, but I feel all the better,&#xD;
now it is written. I hope you will not disappoint your friend&#xD;
by refusing to act as his groomsman, as you spoke of doing&#xD;
this afternoon. I can understand the sacrifice you make, and&#xD;
the effort it costs you to act a part in a scene of festivity when&#xD;
the heart is burdened. I sympathize with you. I judge&#xD;
you by myself: I would not exchange the pleasure I feel 'in&#xD;

sitting here, thinking of~ and writing to you, for any earthly&#xD;
good except your presence. I can therefore fully appreciate&#xD;
the self-abnegation and the kindliness of heart which in-&#xD;
duce you to suffer yourself, rather than mortify the pride of&#xD;
an humble friend, by' refusing to take part in his joy.&#xD;
Must this, indeed, be the last letter I shall write to you&#xD;
during our long separation? I fear it must be so, for I shall&#xD;
not like grim old unsentimental professors to see what I write&#xD;
before it is placed in your hands, and by the rules of the'&#xD;
college which you showed me; they claim that right. You&#xD;
must write to me; you surely will find means to smuggle a&#xD;
letter to the post. But no; that would not be right, and&#xD;
your honest nature would not. allow you to do what you can-&#xD;
not do openly, nor would ]I tempt you to do so. We must,&#xD;
therefore, be satisfied to write every thing in our journals, and&#xD;
read when we meet. Ii have already begun mine.&#xD;
At eight o'clock I shall look up at the stars, whose soft&#xD;
twinkle we have so often watched together, especially the two&#xD;
we call "our stars ;" at half-past nine at night, I shall write&#xD;
in my journal, and as the clock striJ~es ten at night, and&#xD;
seven in the morning, I shall recite my prayers. I know you&#xD;
will do the same. I shall thus see you reflected from the stars,&#xD;
and our vision and thoughts can meet and interchange there,&#xD;
and at the great cathedral altar on high our petitions will&#xD;
meet, and our love centre in the Source of all love and good!&#xD;
Uncle calls for my letter. Excuse the blots my tears have&#xD;
made: I could not help but cry.&#xD;
Yours ever,&#xD;
JESSIE.&#xD;
There were several young ladies and gentlemen present,&#xD;
of the class most likely to gossip, and, as they were disposed&#xD;
to regard Miss Jessie as proud, because she chanced to move&#xD;
in a sphere somewhat removed from theirs-though neither&#xD;

higher in the sense the poor t o often regard it, nor esteemed&#xD;
by her as higher than their own-I felt it my duty so to act&#xD;
in the matter as to secure 'her from unkind remark. All&#xD;
clamored to see the letter, and had many remarks and&#xD;
"guesses" to make about it. I-affected to treat it as no-&#xD;
thing, and promised to read it to them, if they would meet&#xD;
me in the sitting-room after breakfast. They did so; and I&#xD;
pretended to read the letter, but read such a ene as an indif-&#xD;
ferent person would write, using the excuse she had made in&#xD;
her letter for writing; and added some trifling request, which&#xD;
gave it all an air of propriety. They were annoyed to hear&#xD;
nothing more, and their curiosity disappointed. The hurry&#xD;
and bustle of departure made it impossible to explain to&#xD;
Jessie what I had done, and it soon passed out of my mind,&#xD;
and gave place to the deeper feeling, the consciousness ?that,&#xD;
leagues were fast 'multiplying between me and the dear obj ~ct&#xD;
of my love. i~t would be impossible to describe the sadness&#xD;
which weighed upon my spirits, but it only added zeal to my&#xD;
firm purpose of study. Travel was not as rapid then as now,&#xD;
and I only arrived at college a day or two before the com-&#xD;
mencement of the fall session. The last use I made of my&#xD;
liberty was to write a long letter to Jessie.&#xD;
'In the course of eighteen months, my father grew uneasy&#xD;
upon the subject of abolition; and the college itself being&#xD;
but a hot-bed of abolition fanatics, he transferred me from&#xD;
Yale to Princeton, where I completed my 'course of study.&#xD;
Soon after I entered at Princeton, in a letter received from&#xD;
my father, he mentioned having received some letters di-&#xD;
rected to me at Yale, and forwarded from thence to his care,&#xD;
adding that he would retain them until I returned home,&#xD;
unless I should request otherwise. I supposed them to be&#xD;
letters written by some of my old college chums whom I had&#xD;
left in the West, and thought nothing more of it.&#xD;
As lhe time drew near when Ii should finish my course&#xD;

&#xD;
and visit the loved of my heart, my anxiety and impatience&#xD;
were almost uncontrollable. II had learned some time pre~&#xD;
vious, fron~ a paragraph in a newspaper sent me, with black&#xD;
lines run around it, that Mrs. Stanhope had rented her cot-'&#xD;
tage, and removed with her daughter somewhere upon the&#xD;
Northern lakes. This prevented my writing during my va-&#xD;
cations, as I did not know where to direct my letters. It&#xD;
gave me no anxiety, however, as the image of Jessie was&#xD;
always present; and I knew that upon the third anniversary&#xD;
of the day of our separation, and at the same hour, when I&#xD;
should turn into the avenue leading to her mother's cottage,&#xD;
I should see her, as last I saw her, in her white dress leaning&#xD;
against the door-facing, looking wistfully for my coming; and&#xD;
she would bound forward to meet me, as she h'ad done a hun-&#xD;
dred times before. AAd 0 how I longed to throw my arms&#xD;
around her, and receive her joyous welcome home!&#xD;
A few days before the close of the session, I received' a&#xD;
'letter from home informing me of my father's death. I ac-&#xD;
knowledge with shanre that it scarcely affected me, so intense&#xD;
was my desire to be restored to the girl of my heart. His&#xD;
death, however, made it requisite that I should hasten home,&#xD;
which I did immediately upon the receipt of my diploma.&#xD;
I graduated, it seems, with honor, and 'stood first in all my&#xD;
classes; but I was not conscious of either, nor once gave it a&#xD;
thought.&#xD;
My college days passed like a dream, a shadow. I do not&#xD;
know the names of five of my college-mates, and did not&#xD;
when I left college. If they, or my teachers, or my books&#xD;
ever attracted a distinct thought; it has not left its impress.'&#xD;
I am only conscious of quite an annoyance and a to do, con-&#xD;
gratulations, etc., at 1~he close of my college - course, but&#xD;
nothing more.&#xD;
I found that I would barely have time to get home, and&#xD;
attend to necessary business affairs, an~d to reach the little&#xD;

&#xD;
village where I left Jessie and her mother upon the longed-&#xD;
for anniversary. I wrote, the day I left Princeton, a hurried&#xD;
note to a~ old classmate, who had located in the village to&#xD;
practice his profession, of the death of my father; and asked&#xD;
him to write to me, so that his letter would reach me before&#xD;
leaving home, and requested him to give me any news he had&#xD;
to impart respecting Mrs. Stanhope and her daughter.&#xD;
Upon my arrival home, and reading over my father's will,&#xD;
and seeing so many evidences of his worth and kindness,&#xD;
and so many things demonstrative of his loneliness, and de-&#xD;
sire to be united with his family in heaven, and his many&#xD;
anxieties on my account, and the care he had taken to pro-&#xD;
~vide every thing for my comfort and happiness, I was re-&#xD;
buked and humbled; and felt for the first time the real sor-&#xD;
row of a. son for the loss of a good father. I deeply regretted&#xD;
that I had not done more to lighten his sorrow. I was aston-&#xD;
ished and mortified to find, upon reflection, that he had&#xD;
scarcely been in my thoughts during my long absence,&#xD;
though I had been the only living object of his thoughts and&#xD;
care. I eagerly looked into his correspondence with the col-&#xD;
lege faculty, to see if any thing had been reported to him, of&#xD;
me which might have added to his sorrow. It was one of&#xD;
th~ most delicious moments of my life, when I discovered&#xD;
that, so far from bad reports, they were of the most flattering&#xD;
and encouraging kind. It was not that I thought I deserved&#xD;
praise for what I h~d done, for I did not, as I had acted me-&#xD;
chanically, without the desire of good,~ or the temptation to&#xD;
do wrong, but solely to finish my course of study by a par-&#xD;
ticular day. The pleasure I experienced was the conscious-&#xD;
ness that I had chanced tb act in a manner that gave him&#xD;
the only pleasure left for him in life. I had, according to&#xD;
the reports, been most exemplary in my deportment, and suc-&#xD;
cessful in my studies; and enjoyed the good will and confi-&#xD;
&#xD;
dence of my teachers, and the affection of my schoolfellows.&#xD;
It was all news to me; as much so as if it had been written&#xD;
of a stranger; but, true or false, it made me happy, and&#xD;
enabled me to kneel without serious self-reproach in the&#xD;
family burying-ground, where my parents, brother, and sister&#xD;
lay buried.&#xD;
I picked up the bundle of letters my father had spoken&#xD;
of as having been forwarded to his cake from Yale. The&#xD;
seals were unbroken, another evidence of his kindness and&#xD;
delicacy. Most of them were from old schoolmates. Only&#xD;
one attracted my attention: it was a package in the hand-&#xD;
writing of Jessie. My pulse beat quick with delight as&#xD;
I hastily broke the seal; but 0! what suffocation suc-&#xD;
ceeded, when there dropped from it a plain gold ring which&#xD;
I had placed upon her finger, and a lock of my ~hair which&#xD;
s~ie had clipped, and worn with her curls, and a few dried&#xD;
rose-leaves and buc~s! My breath came hard, and the rush&#xD;
of blood to my head blinded me, and it was some time before&#xD;
I could see to read. The letter read thus:&#xD;
HORACE STANLEY, EsQ.:&#xD;
Sir, I once lov~d you! 0 God, how dearly! But it is past.&#xD;
I then thought you a gentleman; I know better now. I then&#xD;
thought you all that was honorable, all that was noble, all&#xD;
that was generous; but I have been taught better. And 0!&#xD;
what a lesson, what a lesson, what a lesson for this poor,&#xD;
weak, trusting, breaking heart to learn! I am ashamed that&#xD;
you have the power to wring such exclamations and such&#xD;
tears from me!&#xD;
I enclose the lock of hair which I once wore and loved for&#xD;
your sake. I send you the rosebuds and leaves we last&#xD;
gathered together. Their natural sweetness fled lon~ since,&#xD;
but love gave to the dry withered things a sweetness far&#xD;

greater than the fresh ones that bloomed where we trod, and&#xD;
now attract the bee, and the butterfly; but this is gone, and&#xD;
they are now but thorns and dust.&#xD;
I have heard of your base exposure of my letters, your&#xD;
trifling with my dearest affections before a giddy, thoughtless,&#xD;
vulgar crowd. If it is any pleasure to you to know that you&#xD;
won my affections, that they were all yours-yours to sport&#xD;
with and ridicule before the gossips in town-if it is any plea-&#xD;
sure to you to know that you have humiliated, bent me low&#xD;
in the dust before~ my inferiors, you are welcome to it. Your&#xD;
triumph is complete. Ii am bent, broken! I am no longer&#xD;
the happy, joyou~, but the wretched, heartbroken&#xD;
J]~ssIE STANHOP2&#xD;
P. S.-I have opened this to say: Surely my trusting,&#xD;
happy heart could not have been so mistaken! You can ot&#xD;
be so base as these people tell me! There must be some m s-&#xD;
take! If there is, 0 relieve my aching, bursting, heart y&#xD;
telling me so. It will depend upon your explanation whether&#xD;
you will ever again hear from JESSIE..&#xD;
I looked at the date, and saw with consternation that the&#xD;
letter was nearly twenty months old! By my silence I stood&#xD;
convicted, before my heart's idol, of all that these gossippers&#xD;
had said; What must have been her pain as she waited,&#xD;
mail after mail, for the expected explanation, which, alas, did&#xD;
not come! And how she bowed down under the conscious-&#xD;
ness of my villainy, as time gradually removed all hope of an&#xD;
explanation! My silence itself was an insult, and added an&#xD;
additional weight to the already overburdened heart. The&#xD;
thought was maddening. I ordered my trunk to be packed,&#xD;
and the carriage made ready to convey me to the river, where&#xD;
I might take the first upward-bound boat. As I was about&#xD;
starting, a letter was brought to me from the, post-office. It&#xD;
was from the classznate, I had written to on leaving Prince-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
ton. I opened it hastily, hoping to hear something from&#xD;
Jessie; it ran thus:&#xD;
Sma :-I was sorry to receive a letter from you this morn-&#xD;
ing. Ido not regret the death of your father, as I suppose&#xD;
he died ignorant of the baseness of his only son.&#xD;
I will so far gratify your curiosity to know something of&#xD;
the victim of your heartlessness, to inform you that upon re-&#xD;
ceiving full assurance of your baseness she sank under it,&#xD;
and has gradually wasted away, and is now worn to a shadow.&#xD;
Her mother, grief-wo~'n and sad, will leave with her for Cuba&#xD;
on the next downward trip of the steamer Elkhorn, which&#xD;
will be in about ten days, there to die, should she reach Cuba&#xD;
alive, 'which I very much doubt. In your future coquetries&#xD;
and flirtations, may the grief-worn image of this pale girl fling&#xD;
its shadow before you! I was slow, Horace Stanley, and so&#xD;
was she, to think you utterly base. She hoped, if you could&#xD;
not explain, you would at least apologize. But no! you pre-&#xD;
ferred the full benefit of your triumph! Well, you have it!&#xD;
and welcome be all the pleasure it may give you.&#xD;
Sad and unjust as the letter was, it contained news, and I&#xD;
directed the captain of the boat upon which I took passage&#xD;
not to fail under any circumstances to hail and place me on&#xD;
board the steamer Elkhorn, should we meet her on her down-&#xD;
ward trip. The second day I was informed that the steamer&#xD;
was in sight, and 0, how my heart leaped! How I longed&#xD;
to meet and explain all, and restore health to that pale face!&#xD;
The signal-bell tapped, and was answered as we supposed&#xD;
by the Elkhorn, but the ringing on the latter became furious,&#xD;
and the wild howl of "Fire !" went up from her by a hun-&#xD;
dred terrified voices. She became unmanageable in a mo-&#xD;
ment, and the whole side next to the boat upon which I stood,&#xD;
satchel in hand, ready to leap aboard, was wrapped in flames;&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
and, to save his own boat, the captain was compelled to back&#xD;
her from the burning wreck. I saw two locked in each&#xD;
other's arms spring from the wreck, the long locks of the&#xD;
feebler floated for a moment upon the water, a wild piei~c-&#xD;
xd~g shriek, and they went down-all I loved on earth! I&#xD;
leaped madly into the stream, and exhausted every effort to&#xD;
rescue them, but, alas! the waters of the muddy Mississippi&#xD;
closed over them, and shut out all hope of explanation or re-&#xD;
conciliation, in this life. The one only loved, the one only&#xD;
thought of for three years of arduous labor had gone to her&#xD;
liquid grave believing me a scoundrel; and that belief had&#xD;
killed her!\ "If the Everlasting had not fixed his canon&#xD;
against self-slaughter," I should have cast myself in the stream&#xD;
and perished with the object of my love.&#xD;
Is it any wonderr that I stood upon the bank a wreck, with-&#xD;
out one hope, one aim, but death? Is it a wonder that I&#xD;
eschewed society, and wore away the grass walking~ncar her&#xD;
loved remains?&#xD;
Just opposite here, due west three hundred and seventy-&#xD;
five yards from the bank, 4h&amp;amp;went down, and right there I&#xD;
want my remains to go down. It is my request that the rose-&#xD;
bud that will be found by itself in the casket be pinned to my&#xD;
bosom, and that my journal, in which are the rose-leaves and&#xD;
lock of hair, be placed, sealed as it is, in the coffin with me,&#xD;
and that the coffin be furnished with weights suffi ~ ient to&#xD;
sink me to the bottom beside her. The ring I give t~ Agnes&#xD;
for her wedding-ring; it was intended to grace the finger of&#xD;
a bridQ as innocent, fair, and worthy as she, but it was or-&#xD;
dered otherwise. She will not fail to wear it.&#xD;
The silence which succeeded the reading was almost pain-&#xD;
ful, it was so breathless. It was immediately broken by the&#xD;
Hermit, who said:&#xD;
* "You will say I ought to have had more philosophy,&#xD;
and torn myself away from here, and learned to forget, a~ I&#xD;
&#xD;
had in the ease of my sister. Perhaps I ought; but 1 could&#xD;
not: I lacked the resolution. If I could have seen her but&#xD;
for a moment, and removed from her mind the belief of my&#xD;
guilt, I should have been satisfied, and my life would have&#xD;
been different."&#xD;
As he ceased speaking, Mrs. Clarkson walked to the bed-&#xD;
side, and kneeling down buried her face in her hands, and&#xD;
her whole frame shook with emotion. Calming herself she&#xD;
raised her eyes to his, and said&#xD;
"And this is Horace Stanley, my only relative, the last of&#xD;
our house and name&#xD;
The Hermit put his hand upon her head, ~nd fixed upon&#xD;
her his stony gaze. Something like a smile of recognition&#xD;
passed over his rigid features, and he whispered, "A blessing&#xD;
upon you, Amy, cousin Amy.&#xD;
After this he lay for some time apparently dozing. Waking&#xD;
up, he began to talk at random; his mind was wandering.&#xD;
It was affecting to hear him.&#xD;
"To-day," said he, "is the anniversary of ~ur parting!' I&#xD;
am hastening' to see her; it is near the hour~. Here is the&#xD;
avenue. How natural every thing looks! Ah! did I not tell&#xD;
you she would be waiting? There she stands, the sweet&#xD;
creature, where I left her three years ago, with her white&#xD;
dress and curls. Ah! she sees me! she knows me! she run~&#xD;
to meet me! She flies! Look! look! she floats upward !'~&#xD;
his eyes were directed so earnestly in the direction of the&#xD;
river, that all involuntarily turned to look, and saw~ one of&#xD;
those strangely beautiful illusions which may sometiriies be&#xD;
seen in the swamp: a light fleecy cloud, in the shape of a&#xD;
woman, with long flowing hair and loose robe, floating up4&#xD;
ward. "I knew you would be waiting, watching for me,&#xD;
darling. I have kept my promise to you, love !" and held out&#xD;
his arms as if to embrace herand-sank back, dead!&#xD;
They had met, and all was explained and all forgiven.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
"A good wife's prayer&#xD;
Will from the deepest dnngeon climb to heaven's height,&#xD;
And bring a blessing down."&#xD;
THE wishes of the Hermit were scrupulously carried out,&#xD;
and Mrs. Clarkson and Agnes, often after his burial, walked&#xD;
up and down his old, solitary, well-worn path, talking of his&#xD;
virtues, his stern integrity, his great courage, and, above all,&#xD;
of the strange and incomprehensible manner in which he had&#xD;
served them; and how Almighty God had shown them at&#xD;
last who he was; and of their great happiness in smoothing&#xD;
his pillow in his last moments, and that it was not left for&#xD;
strange hands to perform for him the last sad but sacred wish&#xD;
of his heart.&#xD;
On examining his papers, he was found to be the owner of&#xD;
a large fortune, a part of which was disposed of in charity;&#xD;
the remainder was given to Robert, to take effect on the day&#xD;
of his marriage with Agnes. He left a request that Col.&#xD;
Clarkson should act as trustee for his old serving-man Amos&#xD;
and his wife, and allow them the use of. the cottage, stock,&#xD;
and ground, so long as they lived, and at their death it was&#xD;
to go to Robert and Agnes.&#xD;
Mr. Clarkson, as winter approached, recovered his health,&#xD;
and took his family to the city. I-us wife was anxious that&#xD;
lie should dispose of his residence in town, and make the&#xD;
&#xD;
plantation his permanent home. He suspected her reasons,&#xD;
but did not partake of her fears. There was no danger of his&#xD;
becoming a confirmed gambler, he would often say to himself&#xD;
-he so detested the character. On his return to Bluff City,&#xD;
he was beset by his old companions, and, in violation of all his&#xD;
good resolutions, joined in their games, drinking deeper and&#xD;
playing more desperately than ever before. He would occa-&#xD;
sionally dispute and quarrel ,with the rest, and when it was&#xD;
over and his mind fell back upon itself:, he would feel humili-&#xD;
ated, and resolve not to yield ao'ain but he had no moral or&#xD;
religious ballast to sustain him, and human strength yielded&#xD;
to temptation.&#xD;
One night, for the first time in his life, he got into a regu-&#xD;
lar brawl, and was badly hurt. He was borne home, almost&#xD;
insensible, to his deeply mortified and distressed family; and&#xD;
for several days after he remained in the house, apparently&#xD;
in deep thought.&#xD;
It was a lovely evening in the last of October-one of those&#xD;
soft , golden fall days, when all' nature sets the heart to think-&#xD;
ing-when she seems to say with the softest and most plead-&#xD;
ing voice: Man! look into thyself; see thyself in the falling&#xD;
leaf; listen to the autumnal breeze whispering mournfully in&#xD;
the stout old forest trees, scattering their lingering verdure,&#xD;
and tellin~ of decay. All this Col. Clarkson felt as he sat on&#xD;
his gallery, and his eye ran over the beautiful landscape,&#xD;
tinged here and there with the finger of death. He thought&#xD;
of poor Smith, of Jsaacs, and Orr; he, thought of Blunt,' and&#xD;
Floyd; thought of what they were when he knew them years&#xD;
ago-how each had gone back. From these his mind turned&#xD;
to others whose path of life had been in a different direction:&#xD;
how worthless one class was, and how useful the other.&#xD;
In this thoughtful state of mind, 'his eye wandered over&#xD;
the lovely landscape in search of something to rest upon~&#xD;
something real and substantial.-.-something beyond the power&#xD;

of time and decay. Thus chastened by the gentle voice of&#xD;
nature, his eye fell upon the church which stood in full view&#xD;
of his house, and of which his wife and Agnes had long since&#xD;
become practical members. The beauty of the building had&#xD;
never struck him before; and looking at it a few minutes in&#xD;
silent admiration~ he arose, took his hat and went out. It&#xD;
was the first time he had left die hou e since his affray, and&#xD;
his wife watched him with a beating t~eart, trembling for the&#xD;
result of a visit to the clubs in his excited, state of mind.&#xD;
His steps, however, were not towards the clubs or drinking..&#xD;
saloons~ He seemed attracted to the vicinity of the church.&#xD;
He stood without a short time admiring its architectural pro-&#xD;
portions and lofty steeple, and his curiosity, and a feeling he&#xD;
could not withstand0 led him into the interior. The gran~leur&#xD;
and stillness of the place filled him with respect and awe, and&#xD;
here and there a silent figure, in deep devotion~, made him&#xD;
inly exclaim: "This is none other than the house of God V'&#xD;
He felt irresistibly drawn onward, and, in spired by a worship-&#xD;
ful feeling, he seemed in the presence of the old patriarchs&#xD;
of the Church, and of the great Builder himself.&#xD;
Kneeling before the altar was a female 'figure, in deep,~&#xD;
earnest devotion. She seemed wrestling with Almighty God&#xD;
for some great want, and would not let him go until he blessed&#xD;
her. The form: was familiar to Clarkson, and the sight&#xD;
touched him. It was his true and faithful wife. When she&#xD;
saw the direction he had taken, that he sought the quiet of&#xD;
the church rather than the exciting bowl or card-table, she&#xD;
hastened to pour out her grateful heart in thanks to God, and&#xD;
had gone in unobserved at the rear entrance. He walked&#xD;
softly to where she was-kneeled by her side, and said:&#xD;
"From henceforth, Amy, thy people shall be my people,&#xD;
and thy God my God." He had found something real-.&#xD;
something his' whole life had needed---something beyond the&#xD;
power of time or decay-something more than human strength&#xD;

to assist him in resisting temptation: he had seized upon the&#xD;
only thing which could save him; and there, before the altar,&#xD;
the husband and wife prayed together for the first time, and&#xD;
mingled their tears with their prayers. It was a 'sight for&#xD;
saints and angels to rejoice over. The long years of anxiety,&#xD;
of prayer, and watchfulness, the loving ~,trust,. the patience&#xD;
and Christian forbearance of Mi~s. Olarkson, how fully were&#xD;
they repaid in that happy moment! As she rose from her&#xD;
kneeling posture, the clergyman, an elderly, venerable man,&#xD;
observing her peculiarly happy countenance, looked anxiously&#xD;
a moment at Mr. Clarkson. He saw it all,,and said, in kind-&#xD;
est tone,&#xD;
"Take courage, my daughter. The husband of such a&#xD;
wife can never be lost."&#xD;
Two weeks after, Mr. Clarkson was regularly received into&#xD;
the Church; and the same day, Agnes and Hamilton were&#xD;
united in marriage.&#xD;
On each Sunday ~fter, Col. Clarkson might ~iave been seen&#xD;
worshipping with his family an example for all good fathers.&#xD;
All trace of former ~lissipation had disappeared from his now&#xD;
fine intellectual countenance; and he walked among men a&#xD;
noble specimen of God's creation.&#xD;
Three years have since passed. Robert Hamilton has con~&#xD;
tinted to riso in his profession, winning golden opinions from&#xD;
* all classes of people. Vaughan sleeps by the side of sweet&#xD;
Alice St. Cloud. Their graves are covered with the sai~ie&#xD;
vine, kissed by the same moonbeams, and watered by the tears&#xD;
of the same heart-broken mother, who still pays her daily&#xD;
visit to the grave of her child. James Blunt has committed&#xD;
forgery, and was saved from the penitentiary by the exertions&#xD;
of Robert Hamilton. His wife, Pet, has obtained a divorce&#xD;
,from him, and returned to her father with infant twins.&#xD;
The other "girls" are all well' married, and most excellent&#xD;
and exemplary women. They attend the same old unfash-&#xD;

jonable church, and their husbands, though riot of their own&#xD;
faith, often say to each other, "There can be no harm in a,&#xD;
religion which makes such devoted and dutiful wives;"&#xD;
Piper is a wiser if not a better man: his nose droops more&#xD;
than formerly, and so does Gilpin's tail; but he does not&#xD;
desecrate the Sabbath as he used to, or grumble at Betsy&#xD;
about her religion. Nickols goes hawking about as usual,&#xD;
his countenance showing the effect of long dissipation and&#xD;
excess. Miss Clara Corbin is married to the Louisiana law-&#xD;
yer; and Mrs. AJorbin is looking for a suitable match for a&#xD;
younger daughter.&#xD;
It is Sun day morning. Standing near a certain noted&#xD;
restaurant, might be seen in one direction Col. Olarkson going&#xD;
to church with his family; in the other, two men reeling&#xD;
down street, endeavoring to hold each other up~ "Hic-&#xD;
why, IDoc., if you do n't walk steadier---hic---i '11 let you fall&#xD;
.-hic----on the pavement I"&#xD;
"Why, Blunt, you '11-hic-make me break-hic-some&#xD;
of these windows-~-hic. If you don't-hic----walk steadier-.&#xD;
hic-4 '11 let you fall in the gutter.&#xD;
Tilt they go. It is Dr. Floyd and Blunt. They still&#xD;
drink for good cheer, but another pays for the liquor; they&#xD;
still ~play for amusement, but have to borrow a dollar in order&#xD;
to count the game.&#xD;
