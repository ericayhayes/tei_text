PREFACE.&#xD;
DEAR YOUNG READER :-I wish to say to you that all the&#xD;
cat stories in this book are true. Pauline's donkeys are real&#xD;
donkeys; Flirt a live dog, gay and frisky. As to the rest of the&#xD;
people, I am not so clear in my mind. I know that for the past&#xD;
three or four years I have lived much of 4my life in Rosenbloom&#xD;
and Roaring River. I have watched my favorites, and enjoyed&#xD;
their fun-Zoe, and Sabrina, and naughty Chandy.  I really&#xD;
think I love that boy as if he were my own brother ; but it is a&#xD;
curious fact, that no matter how near I may be to these people,&#xD;
they never notice me. But then, plain old maids must n't expect&#xD;
much attention. They never. notice old Miss Pettingil unless&#xD;
she thrusts herself upon them.&#xD;
Sometimes my enjoyment of'them is blurred and disturbed by&#xD;
voices in my ear, and I rouse myself to the fact that people are&#xD;
talking to me of "soap, and candles, and marketing," and I find&#xD;
that I am sitting at my little table with a pen in my fingers.&#xD;
There ! I can't stop, kind reader.  Jan Vedder is out for a&#xD;
walk with Sonsie Eagan; he's a good looking fellow, and that&#xD;
Sonsie is going to be a real Irish beauty. Zoe Walsingham'has&#xD;
got heaps of wedding finery about her.gI must hear her and&#xD;
&#xD;

PREFACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Sabrina talk it up. I love weddings. And my poor dear Chris,&#xD;
whom I love better than all, is suffering; she needs me. I can-&#xD;
not stop, really. I am happiest in Roaring liver. They never&#xD;
bother me there with butcher's bills, nor make me tell what's&#xD;
to be for dinner. Pretty reader, adieu.&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DUGHTE&#xD;
CHAPTER FIRST.&#xD;
THE GONECUSSETS.&#xD;
THE name of the place always had been Roaring R&#xD;
it really seemed a pity to change it, because it was so s&#xD;
appropriate.&#xD;
You see the deep waters came rushing, and roaring,:&#xD;

rying all the way through the ravines and deep-worn c&#xD;
has conquered for itself-just as the waters come down&#xD;
dore-thundering past the "Hog's Back," worrying an&#xD;
eddying and foaming, and getting up no end of fnss a&#xD;
about the lofty Turk's Head; vaulting and leaping wi&#xD;
splash over the big black mill-wheel; singing and&#xD;
boisterous bender, before it subsides intorippling whisp&#xD;
wide 'grassy flats, and then into sleepy quiet. A mi&#xD;
decorousriver, which has seen the folly of it, and call&#xD;
the frolic freaks of its gay youth.&#xD;
The winding, narrow valley, which we call the G&#xD;
spacious enough for Roaring River ana a green-borde&#xD;
way, was a sweet grassy place, full of echoes, andgay i&#xD;
time with snowy trilliums, squirrel-corn, and pale puzp&#xD;

nias. In a sheltered hollow contrived by nature, stood the old&#xD;
red grist-mill, and a famous resort it was for the farmers. There'&#xD;
they weighed up affairs and sifted them; discussed the Presi-&#xD;
dent's veto and the taxes, and the Thanksgiving Proclamation,&#xD;
and the doings at the last school-meeting, where Captain Slocum,&#xD;
the great Texan grazier had made a strong running for trustee&#xD;
against, Esqupe jitchcock, and beat him all hollow,-although the&#xD;
Esquire was a family man with a host of white-headed children&#xD;
to educate, and the slim, wiry captain was only a bachelor with-&#xD;
out expectations.&#xD;
They were assisted at odd times by the dusty miller in his&#xD;
floury clothes, his ruddy face and curled eyelashes all patched&#xD;
and powdered like a court-lady's. Everybody liked "Taffy the&#xD;
Welchman," as they called the jolly fellow. (His family name&#xD;
was spelled with "two L's and two H's, two R's, and a W.")&#xD;
Everybody laughed at his ready jokes and odd grimaces, and his&#xD;
jolly old songs and pealing haw-haws were a jubilant accompa-&#xD;
niment to the sounding anthem ofthe ever-rushing water.&#xD;
The steady old farm-horsers whinnied and conversed in horse-&#xD;
whispers, and rattled their harness while they waited, sometimes&#xD;
dozing:patiently off: n the sunshine, and nodding like christians&#xD;
under a fourteen thly sermon, anil waking up again to pick out&#xD;
the tender stops off the chicken-grass and red-bloom, noways put&#xD;
out by the violent politics of their masters, or the heavy roll and&#xD;
click of the great wheel.&#xD;
The red, sandy road: flowed the. devious course of Roaring&#xD;
River all the way up the glen, past the old farm of the Craigen-&#xD;
fells, a 'operty which Thad come.dow n through four or five gen-&#xD;
orations and never lost an acrein the transit. wise people, fond&#xD;
of adjusting -their friept's affairs, would wag theirheads and say&#xD;
how much better it would be for the:land, and how much more&#xD;
solid, and respectable, if the present owner were a family man,&#xD;
instead of an old bachelor greatly given to wandering up and&#xD;
down :in the world, not caring meuch about the say-so of his .neigh-&#xD;
-rs. and guiltless of all ambition to -lead .n their town politics.&#xD;

&#xD;
which they softly filled to overflowing, and then danced and rip-&#xD;
pled away in tiny brooklets to join the mad music of Roaring&#xD;
River.&#xD;
As I said, it really seemed. a pity to change the name of the.&#xD;
town to Millville. ' As- the meaning of "finger hoot" is patent,&#xD;
and the word more suggestive, than "thimble " to describe the&#xD;
pretty golden shield we love to get atChristmas;.so was. Roaring&#xD;
River more significant than Millville to the people who had been&#xD;
boys and girls in the mansions and farm-houses, and who knew&#xD;
every wild freak and frothy curve of the hurrying waters, and&#xD;
who had found the haunts and homes of the speckled trout under&#xD;
the shadow of their favorite rocks, and who had pic-nicked. on the&#xD;
banks and boated on the sparkling current. But Deacon Wil-&#xD;
liams, Esquire -Hitchcock, Capt. Slocum, and Mr. John Bisbee,&#xD;
had gotten up a great association, which they called "The Gone-&#xD;
cusset Manufacturing Company," and they had- built, first a vast&#xD;
satinet factory, and then some immense scythe works in the pretty&#xD;
grassy glen, and so spoilt all the echoes, and the ugly trip-hammers&#xD;
pounded and crunched their work all day, like remorseless,&#xD;
sullen, long-headed monsters devouring their prey. These inno-&#xD;
vations of the rural quiet did not by any means satisfy the enter-&#xD;
prising Gonecussets. They considered, and behold ! the "water&#xD;
privilege" was not nearly exhausted,' so they met and took coun-&#xD;
sel and erected a pin factory in the sweetest spot there was left,&#xD;
and felt better. In process of time, favored visitors were per-&#xD;
mitted to'view the papers of pins coming down through a hole in&#xD;
the ceiling, all stuck in perfect rows like tin soldiers- on drill, and&#xD;
they were informed by 'the obliging foreman' that "'they did it&#xD;
themselves," out of promiscuous. heaps up above.! though that&#xD;
agreeable person politely declined to admit the favored ones to&#xD;
witness the "how of it," that being conducted in: secrecy and&#xD;
seclusion.&#xD;
It must be conceded that these busy Gonecussets -had, as they&#xD;
were fond of noisily asserting, "done a 'good, deal for Roaring&#xD;
River? They had brought din° and clatter, and .bustle and go-&#xD;
sahead, where-all had been sweet rural.quiet. They had builded&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.               11&#xD;
up a whole street of factory dwellings exactly alike, with peaked&#xD;
roofs and dormer windows, and all done brown. They had also&#xD;
imported to inhabit them, men, women, and children, who were&#xD;
evidently gathered out of the highways and hedges, and had not&#xD;
as yet sat down to the banquet.&#xD;
By putting their heads together, maneuvering and planning,&#xD;
and performing a good deal of, the labor which they called "lay-&#xD;
ing pipe," part of which seemed to be button-holing people, and&#xD;
winking and whispering, they had got to have things pretty much&#xD;
their own way. Now these enterprising Gonecussets, especially&#xD;
Deacon Williams and Esquire Hitchcock, said and said again,&#xD;
that Roaring River wasn't any kind of a name for a christian&#xD;
town, where there were three churches well attended, besides the'&#xD;
Universalists, and Seventh-day Baptists, and the Second Advent-&#xD;
ists, and Spiritualists,,who met turn and turn about in the school-&#xD;
house, and they were going to have it changed to Millville. The&#xD;
Esquire suggested that Hitchcockville would sound better, (I&#xD;
suppose as commemorative of his good works,)..and offered to&#xD;
give land enough for'a park as a christening gift, in case such&#xD;
name should meet their views, on, condition that his co-workers&#xD;
should contribute "a spouter in the center on't," (meaning a fuin-&#xD;
nel for a fountain,) but the generous proposal met with no favor&#xD;
-Deacon Williams saying:&#xD;
"No sir, Square, we de-sign to name our teoun Millville, and&#xD;
if we con-clude to have a park, as you may say in a manner,&#xD;
we'll just vote one, and save our money."&#xD;
So they called a town meeting, and voted and carried their&#xD;
project, and it was all done and clenched before the Roaring Riv-&#xD;
erites-the Walsinglhams, and Craigenfells, and Claytons, and&#xD;
Bradshaws, and Goldsmiths, and the rest of the gente descente&#xD;
had waked up to the subject, and the new hotel was named&#xD;
"Millville House," and smelled as sweetly as by any other name.&#xD;
They did talk the matter over among themselves, and held in&#xD;
a general way the intention to have the great township divided,&#xD;
and their side of the river set off under its ancient and well-&#xD;
beloved appellation, and they clung to the name, and also went&#xD;

Onhvisiting a good deal among themselves, and quietly ignoring&#xD;
the din and progress on the other side of them.&#xD;
The Millville faction blusteringly asserted that they were the&#xD;
"first folks," and blazed away, and gave parties, and dressed fine,&#xD;
and made the most of themselves, but too often with harrowing&#xD;
visions, of a Mordecai sitting at the king's gate to put them out&#xD;
of conceit with their grandeur.&#xD;

attributes and embelishing them  with graces of his own. At'&#xD;
eighteen he got a "lung difficulty," by exposure to a soaking rain&#xD;
while he sketched, oblivious to all except the entrancing effects&#xD;
of the gorgeous autumn coloring, and the feathery gray mists&#xD;
clinging to the mountain sides. Mr. Goldsmith took counsel of&#xD;
all the doctors far and'near, in a fever of alarm for the precious&#xD;
health of his heir, and made haste toship him off to Italy in the&#xD;
care of Norris Jenkins who had just graduated from Yalerand&#xD;
desired to pursue his medical studies abroad, and young Fred&#xD;
departed with a hectic bloom on his fair cheek, and a pang of&#xD;
love in his heart for a round-faced, black-eyed maiden whom&#xD;
he used - to watch all through singing-school, (from the trial trip&#xD;
of do, re, mi, to the triumphant finale of the Hallelujah chorus.)&#xD;
with his. soul in his eyes; and when in the final interview, he&#xD;
threw his arms around her and held her to his throbbing heart in&#xD;
a passionate embrace, she held in her rather red fingers a written&#xD;
promise of marriage signed- by the foolish youngster, and he was&#xD;
half mad with love and joy when she vowed to be his as soon as&#xD;
he returned to claim her.&#xD;
After five years wandering in foreign lands, roving wherever&#xD;
his fancy listed, and dipping into all springs of knowledge as his&#xD;
humor suggested, studying art in Italy, music in Leipsic, and&#xD;
peasant, life among the gay Bavarians, he was recalled to his&#xD;
home by his father's death, and returned to find himself a Wealthy&#xD;
land-holder, and his half-forgotten Juno a sharp-featured, angular&#xD;
iariden, with a voice like a file and a figure like a bed-post. That&#xD;
she was narrow and common-place he had discovered long ago,&#xD;
and hi artist soul shrank from her companionship. When after&#xD;
a request which was very nearly a threat, he reluctantly paid her&#xD;
a visit, she exhibited the chain he. had so rapturously welded&#xD;
upon her wrist, and reminded him of his promise, and brought out&#xD;
the proofs, he frankly told her that he could not keep his boyish&#xD;
word to her, for he had no longer a heart. to bestow. Miss Pice&#xD;
talked about "a suit," "her rights," &amp;amp;c. She had rejected richer&#xD;
and better offers, to keep troth to him (so she said). ..After a&#xD;
short struggle between duty and 'honor on one hand, and inclina-&#xD;

tion and a dread of being hauled before the public onthe other,&#xD;
he told her if she chose to take him, he would do his best, and&#xD;
he privately thought that the years of his bondage would not be&#xD;
many. But though he weakly suffered himself to be tied for life&#xD;
to a woman who married him in the McStinger style, he did .try&#xD;
to suppress a sigh of regret for the gifted Eleanor Walsingham,&#xD;
who had been his companion du voyage, and held his susceptible&#xD;
soul in thrall ever- since, with her gay brilliancy and rich dark&#xD;
beauty; but that was all lost now, and he took to his home Mrs.&#xD;
Price Goldsmith; and -let us do her the justice to say that she&#xD;
brought there thrift and economy, and his affairs greatly prospered&#xD;
in her hard hands, which, although they felt atrifle rough and&#xD;
bony in the soft palms, of her young husband, made excellent&#xD;
butter and cheese. I suppose it could not }e helped that poor&#xD;
dreamy Fred drifted slowly farther and farther from the partner&#xD;
of his life, till' they had scarcely a thought in common. Black-&#xD;
eyed Hannah, in spite of her multiform occupations, found plenty&#xD;
of time to, get grimer and grimer as she saw her handsome young&#xD;
spouse occupying himself with his own pursuits, and engrossed&#xD;
with pleasures in which she had n share. Suffering in silence&#xD;
was not her forte, however, and as soon as the first awe of his&#xD;
elegant presence wore off, she wagged her scolding tongue in&#xD;
season and out of season. Sometimes he replied with odd con-&#xD;
ceits, and sometimes with playful sarcasms, but later when the&#xD;
ceaseless clatter broke in upon him, jarring his fine-strung nerves,&#xD;
and disturbing his thoughts, he would turn away with distrait,&#xD;
absorbed manner, and making a cup of his hand he would brush&#xD;
his ears as one drives off a troublesome buzzing insect, and the&#xD;
lines in his forehead would deepen into a perplexed frown,&#xD;
and his dreamy eyes take on a far-away mournful look, as if&#xD;
vainly trying to pursue a flying vision.&#xD;
He had a studio in the roomy old garret, into which he cut&#xD;
top-lights and dormer windows, and lie filled it up with an odd&#xD;
collection of lay figures and studies, and costumes and bronzes,&#xD;
and costly knick-knacks which he had gathered together in his&#xD;

"Sir John Chandos, who was a strong and bold knight, cool in&#xD;
all his undertakings, had his banner advanced before him, sur-&#xD;
rounded by his men, with his scutcheon above his arms. He&#xD;
himself was dressed in a large robe. which fell to the ground,&#xD;
blazoned with his arms on white sarcenet, argent a- pile gules, on&#xD;
his heart and 'on his back ; so that ,he appeared resolved upon&#xD;
some adventurous undertaking, and in this state, sword in and,&#xD;
he advanced toward the enemy. When he was struck down by&#xD;
the fatal lance, the other knights were like men, distracted at&#xD;
seeing their master lie thus upon the 'ground. The Barons and&#xD;
gentlemen of 'Poiton were also struck with grief when they saw&#xD;
their seneschal Sir John Chandos lying in so dolefulRa way, and&#xD;
they began grievously to lament his loss, saying: Oh, Flower of&#xD;
Knighthood ! Oh, Sir John Chandos ! Cursed be the forging&#xD;
of that lance which wounded thee! And they wrung their hands&#xD;
.and tore their hair, more especially those of his own.household.&#xD;
God havg mercy on his soul, for never since an hundred years&#xD;
did there exist among the English one more courteous, nor fuller&#xD;
of every virtue and good quality than him."&#xD;
"Therefore, my good Hannah, may it please' you that we&#xD;
christen our noble child 'John Chandos,' because -he ;excelled in&#xD;
all knightly virtues, such as we wish the youngster to possess.&#xD;
More especially I must note this remark of the old chronicler,-&#xD;
'so much was he beloved that the king of England and all his&#xD;
court would believe what he said in preference to all others."&#xD;
The good wife smiled grimly in' answer to this appeal, and&#xD;
trotted the curly-headed fellow on her lap, till his soft hair rose&#xD;
and. fell like a golden mist; and she also vouchsafed some cutting&#xD;
remarks upon the  lly, not to say sinfulness, of naming a chris-&#xD;
tian baby after a n sty, fighting old heathen-" not that I know&#xD;
anything about hi  or his doings; I should hope I was better&#xD;
fetched up than to ,aste my .precious time-in reading novels and&#xD;
trifling story-books when there was, plenty of work to do. If I&#xD;
was to speak my r1ind, which is of course of no consequence, I&#xD;
should say that there's a. plenty of high-sounding names in the&#xD;

of asking my opinionw--go on your own *ay, do; I hope I know&#xD;
my place by this time."&#xD;
John Chandos got his christening,.and flourished, and bore his&#xD;
name gal.antly, and developed with each passing day into a mer-&#xD;
ry-tempered, gay, happy'fellow, who saw'the sunny side of things,&#xD;
and all whose clouds had silver' linings.- Two years after him&#xD;
there alighted upon the home-hearth a lovely little girl-"faii.,&#xD;
fair, with 'golden hair."  Again the name-question was agitated.&#xD;
Mrs. Goldsmith, who still resented the slight upon gran'ther&#xD;
Price, secretly resolved' to have 'her own wag this time, and call&#xD;
her little woman Patience.&#xD;
'And I do hope she'll have it, too," said she; "for I'm sure we&#xD;
need enough on't, so put on as we be."&#xD;
Again the husband brought down his book, and this time hor-&#xD;
ror of horrors ! it was poetry ! He read smoothly and enjoyingly&#xD;
on in his sweet voice, wrapt in the lovely vision he conjured for&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
Christabel," said he, disturbed at last by Sir John Chandos&#xD;
who clambered on his knee, and insisted on looking his fill at the&#xD;
picture of the pretty lady--" Christabel is a charming name; my&#xD;
dear; don't you think so ?&#xD;
" Sniff, sniff--no, I don't think nothing of the sort. If you&#xD;
must take a'name out of that hifalutin stuff that the dog can't 'un-&#xD;
derstand, why don't you take t'other one ? I'm sure it's mpuch the&#xD;
finest sounding' of the two. You can't pull the wool over my&#xD;
eyes. I know you would' say Eleanor if you dast to; but let'&#xD;
me tell you, Fred Goldsmith, once for all, that won't never be the&#xD;
naming of a child of mine, not while I'm in myfright mind; so&#xD;
you needn't talk about it., I've suffered in silence, and Put up&#xD;
*with things 'enough, but that is a dose I shan't take, not if I'm&#xD;
choked fortt"  She drew in her sharp chin and swallowed some-&#xD;
thing, and pinched in her blue lips, and snapped her teeth to-&#xD;
gether, and gazed at him, grim and' belligerent. The young hus-&#xD;
band's cheek flushed and he glanced wistfully at her a moment,&#xD;
as if about to reply. Then sighing,' he 'put his boy away from his&#xD;
lap softly, and set the volume carefully in its place on the shelf.&#xD;
&#xD;
18&#xD;
&#xD;
Then plunging his hands'deep in his dressing-gown pockets, he&#xD;
wrapped that garment about him, and passed out, at the wide hall&#xD;
door, under the old' oaks, where he walked up and down, whistling&#xD;
leasntly, till the  ight fell, and the sharp voice of his most&#xD;
adorable called him back from that brief glorious past he had&#xD;
been foolishlylhym over, to the work-a-day world which she&#xD;
virtuously inhabited.&#xD;
"Mr.. Goldsmith! do you want to catch your everlasting death&#xD;
a-cold out there, in the dew and damp? If you do, just go on&#xD;
tramping up and down in them there slips on yourfeet. For&#xD;
pity sakes! as if I hadn't enough to do without nussin sick folks.&#xD;
I declare to goodness,' you take as much lookin' after as a baby."&#xD;
Chandos and Christabel were presentable children; both like&#xD;
their father, fine and clear in form and coloring,, and were kept&#xD;
scrubbed and combed, and "cleaned up"' within an inch of' their&#xD;
lives. Mrs. Goldsmith was accustomed to boast to her friendsF:&#xD;
"My Chandos never gets a speck of dirt onto him noway';&#xD;
and he is / as dainty about tumbling himself as: a pussypcaf.&#xD;
He takes arter my folks there-the Prices was all as neatas&#xD;
wax.&#xD;
Both children had the large soft brown eyes and clear-cut fea-&#xD;
tures which made the father so handsome, and both had the&#xD;
springing grace of motion which belongs of right to all healthy&#xD;
young animals. Great pride and comfort did Fred take in his&#xD;
off-shoots, the' little maiden especially. She was his pet and&#xD;
plaything, the companion of his walks and fishing excursions, and&#xD;
when but a "wee tot " she would sit patiently beside him on the&#xD;
grassy bank and watch his line over the rippling brook, and she&#xD;
shared his exultation when he landed a big grayling, examining&#xD;
the prize, admiring its shining scales, with a little sigh of womanish&#xD;
pity for its panting struggle, which she took care always to hide.&#xD;
She learned early to comprehend her father's moods, and to syme&#xD;
pathise with them. The sharp words whi-ch her mother darted&#xD;
at him' wounded and cut her to the heart sorely, though they&#xD;
passed by him as the idle wind which he;regarded not.&#xD;

Any answer was hindered by the appearance of Mrs. Gold-&#xD;
smith, glowering in the doorway:  -&#xD;
"You come out here this instant minute, you Christabel! and&#xD;
get your hair fixed up. It's a great deal more bother than it is&#xD;
-worth, and I've a good mind to snip 'em off, and done with it."&#xD;
This was a frequently recurring threat on the part of the im-&#xD;
patient dame, and Fred was accustomed to entreat for thecurls&#xD;
in such quaint, funny language, and with such oddequeer quota-,&#xD;
tions as made Chris laugh, and to offer to dress them himself, and&#xD;
he once made the attempt, and the two frolicked like gleeful&#xD;
children while trying to smooth their tangled luxuriance, and&#xD;
bring them into seemly order.. He loved to see the wind tossing&#xD;
them about and playing with them. .In fact, his beautiful daughter,&#xD;
was always a picture 'and a-study to him, and the child loved her,&#xD;
pretty hair for her father's sake. It- was charming, this perfect&#xD;
understan ing and the satisfaction these two delicate natures had,&#xD;
in eachgpther. The good wife looked grim and jealous over it,&#xD;
and resented it: as a personal affront. Seeing them merry and&#xD;
chatty, she would make sudden dashes upon them out.under the&#xD;
oaks, or sitting on the shady piazza with books and pencils, and&#xD;
pounce upon Chris and carry her off in virtuous triumph to the&#xD;
hateful sewing-work. Mayhap she had been more pitiful and&#xD;
considerate if her little, soul had been less bent upon linking and&#xD;
saving, and she had taken time to observe her husband's narrow-&#xD;
ing chest, and his, hollow cheeks, and the ever deepening lines'&#xD;
around hismouth, sorrowful lines,:as of a grief battled with in&#xD;
secret, and the often contractions of his brows with sharp and&#xD;
sudden pain.&#xD;
When Christabel was ten ,years old, Chandos was- sent to&#xD;
school. Mr. Goldsmith was so often languid and tired that the&#xD;
hearty,afun-making, roistering boy was too much for his nerves,&#xD;
and an academy was :carefully selected for him, where physical&#xD;
training was looked after as well as intellectual development and&#xD;
where he got on, as he did, everywhere, admirably, making the&#xD;
tuost and the best of everything=; had his fast- pony, and his fast,&#xD;
"cockle-shell," and was the=pet and favorite of masters and boys;&#xD;
&#xD;
and, the worthy matron, who was a childless widow, used to tuck&#xD;
him into his bed every night with a hearty kiss on both of his&#xD;
rosy cheeks, and would wipe off furtive -tears when he returned&#xD;
her motherly caress.&#xD;
For two delightful years Christabel had her ppAll to herself,&#xD;
studying, reading, fishing, -sporting; riding, floyer-working. .In&#xD;
her after days of joy or sorrow, she always .dwelt upon these&#xD;
glorious times, even when they had got so far away from her in&#xD;
her journey as to be but, a golden dream of the dead past.'-&#xD;
The slant rays of the September sunshine made the old library&#xD;
very cheersome ; and the red maple leaves glinted and peeped in&#xD;
at the windows, and cast fanciful shadows on the rows and piles&#xD;
of books, and the globes and cabinets. Mr. Goldsmith was too&#xD;
much absorbed to observe details, though his .harmonious sur-&#xD;
roundings affected him agreeably, and his face wore. a pleasant,&#xD;
genial, abstracted smile while he worked.&#xD;
He was filling in a gay poem he had written for Christabel's&#xD;
birthday, with illustrations and embellishments. The initial letter&#xD;
he was busy -on, shone resplendent in ultra-meirine and vermilion,&#xD;
and 'he was just overlaying it with gold tracery, which required&#xD;
delicate handling, when a sound smote his ear which could always&#xD;
recall him from the most absorbed musing or intense study. It&#xD;
was his darling's voice, full of trouble, entreating and protesting,&#xD;
dominated by her mother's sharp tones, shrill, ear-splitting, scold-&#xD;
ing drearily.&#xD;
He got up hastily And stepped acrossthe wide hall into:the&#xD;
sitting-room doorway, and he pressed his lips together, and stood&#xD;
quiet and still, unnoticed by the good wife, who was brandishing&#xD;
a pair of shears over the devoted head of his little pet,. who,&#xD;
poor child, shrank as far as possible away from the fatal weapon,&#xD;
which she regarded with frightened gaze, her face the while half&#xD;
stormy, half pitiful, and both .her hands about the mass of chest-&#xD;
nut curls  hich her papa loved.&#xD;
"Don't, mother! don't !. You will' not! you cannot!  Papa&#xD;

and anything else he likes; as for loving your hair, don't talk&#xD;

such wicked foolishness. I guess he would turn his tune if,&#xD;
he had to comb a nd brush it forty times a day ; to see him fussing&#xD;
and pulling that mop around .makes me disgusted'vick. I shan't&#xD;
bother no more, you're too big; I'm goin' to cut it off for all him&#xD;

in her 'blue lips with her teeth tight settogether, and her facial&#xD;
muscles stiff and rigid,,though her red-black eyes glowed like&#xD;
fiery coals. "You won't never be of no account, nohow, to take&#xD;

It's no use begging' for this nasty, fruzzlin' mess of hair, because&#xD;
I hate the sight o't; so put down your paws, and stop your&#xD;
screechin', enough to scare the owls."&#xD;
They must have been very timid owls -indeed who could be&#xD;
seared by Chris's plaintive little- voice.&#xD;
"Indeed, another, I will take care.of my hair and keep it nicely.&#xD;
I'll brush it myself;-you shall never be troubled about it any&#xD;
more, only don't cut off my curls, dear mother, don't !&#xD;
The reinorseless shears made a sharp snip, and one rich curl&#xD;
lay coiling on the, floor. a heap of rippling satin.&#xD;
Oh, my pretty =hair," moaned -Chris, regarding it ruefully.&#xD;
"Papa said I must always wear it so; he told me it brought back&#xD;
his.yeih to look at it, and he kissed it s many times ; oh dear!&#xD;
he Writ ever kiss it any more, and I shall be so ugly."&#xD;
A slippboxron the ear stbppedthe child's sobing expostua-&#xD;

andmotJofiless, gazing fearfully at the spectacle her mother made&#xD;
in herfury, and  wishing she had not spoken.&#xD;
Th oihe asorespot in-the hard woman's heart or temper was&#xD;

all hardened into drawn-downlines, her thin  air scrap back&#xD;
and stiff "beau catchers" pasted in front of her stingy ears.&#xD;
&#xD;
'Mr. Goldsmith stepped quietly forward, his hands plunged deep&#xD;
in his dressing-gown pockets, and clenched there. His face was&#xD;
very pale save the one crimson spot in either cheek, and his aes&#xD;
shone with dangerous light. The hand which he drew forth and&#xD;

but his voice kept its even, musical tone.&#xD;
"Ifyou please, Hannah, I will guard those fateful weapons ;&#xD;
they are not pretty in outline, being something clumsy as well as&#xD;
rusty, and scarcely fitted, to make acquaintance with the cherished&#xD;
tresses of my tender darling.' I have but a word to say; don't&#xD;
cut off my daughter's curls, either now or ever.. I command you&#xD;
to leave their luxuriant beauty alone; it is God-given, and she&#xD;
shall not be despoiled. It is few enough requests I have :ever&#xD;
.troubled you with ; this is a command, and I will have you obey&#xD;
yme." He stooped and picked up the shining coil from the floor,&#xD;
and smoothing it carefully in his hand he said:&#xD;
"'Twas a pity to sunder this pretty thing, but it shall not be&#xD;
lost, I will keep it safely, my Hannah; we may sometimes; when&#xD;
our little Chris is wooed and married, or gone from us, 1q91 at it&#xD;
tenderly for her childish sake."&#xD;
You can talk just as buttery as you've a mind to, hut 'words&#xD;

were like-"&#xD;
"Hannah .tannah!. he. interrupted hastily, "I've been a&#xD;
,true and faithful husband to you. You knew well when you took&#xD;
me that I could not love you desperately (smiIig). You mar-&#xD;

and you must bear with me the best you can. I think I shall not&#xD;
trouble you long. Madam Goldsmith will be a gay widow-"&#xD;
I wish I hadn't never sot eyes onto you; I've had to fight my&#xD;
way alone. You haven't troubled your head about me, no how--&#xD;
painting and daubing, and gunning and. fishing, anything.-and&#xD;
everything before your wife. I wish in my soul you'd a married&#xD;

a thankless life .on't; I wish to gracious goodness I was out of&#xD;
your way, so as you might take her now. That is the way it goes;&#xD;
the first wife pinches, and saves, and digs, and delves,, for the&#xD;
next one to step in: with her frippery and her furbelows, and&#xD;
walking, and minclu', and akin' a tinklin' with her feet. Yes,&#xD;
and I'm no more account to you, Fred Goldsmith, than a pig -&#xD;
weed in your garden, and the mother and wife I am, too! Paugh !&#xD;
I'i sick on't 1"&#xD;
"Believe me, ray Hannah, I appreciate your labors. If I&#xD;
have unwittingly drifted away from you and neglected you, (and&#xD;
I am afraid I have,) and occupied myself with my books and pic-&#xD;
tures too raich, forgive ine; I didn't' mean to do it'; I'll behave&#xD;
better in future. We have got so far along in harness, do let us&#xD;
jog on to the end of oar lives as God wills, and keep the ineomi&#xD;
patibility of temper as much in the background as we are able.&#xD;
I haves been sadly to blame, but it isn't too late to do better.'&#xD;
His fare settled from the half ,mocking smile it had worn into&#xD;
a sorrowful patience, and he sighed drearily.&#xD;
"I no need to have waited for you to come back; folks threw&#xD;
it up at me that you was stayin' out in them forrin parts to get&#xD;
rid of 'me. I had offers enough; I night have got minrried forty&#xD;
times if I hadn't had a tender conscience. -Sam Risley wanted&#xD;
me; he's a railroad contractor now, and as rich as cream ; I've&#xD;
seen 'liiri light his cigar with a five dollar bill, he was that free&#xD;
with his money; but no, I would stick to my protnise ; I'd made&#xD;
it, and t wasn't goin' to ,let no one step in here where I'd sot up&#xD;
ay mind to live myself."&#xD;
"And you would rake ie stick to mine" murmured Fred, with&#xD;
a whimsical grimace. " I grieve deeply with you, my Ik nnah,&#xD;
that you rejected 'the glorious Sati to link your fate' with your&#xD;
unworthy servant; but as you deliberately thought' best to do so,&#xD;
pray let us. not wrangle, and worry, and devour each other. Come,&#xD;
My HIanah, let us be comfortable and quiet together. I mean&#xD;
to be a gdod husband all the balance of my life, and you inust let&#xD;
the dead past bury its dead. Yoh shall ever have cause to com-&#xD;
lai o me again."&#xD;
&#xD;
He smiled pleasantly at her, and made an offer to grasp' her&#xD;
hand, but she snatched it away, and ejaculated,-&#xD;
"Fiddlesticks,! don't be a fool! All I ask of you is to let me&#xD;
alone. You go your ways and I shall go mine. I don't make&#xD;
no account of your soft speeches; you needn't pretend to care&#xD;
anything about me, for I know .it's all pretending, and don't&#xD;
amount to that (snapping her fingers). You've sot that child up&#xD;
against me," (pointing to Chris, a trembling, frightened listener&#xD;
to this matrimonial interchange of sweets, who stood with her&#xD;
hands clasped and her eyes fired on her father's face,) "you've&#xD;
let her hear words that never ought to have been spoken. You're&#xD;
all the while teachin' the children on purpose to set 'em up and&#xD;
make 'em despise the mother that brought 'em into this sinful&#xD;
world that's all full of men and all sorts of wickedness. I won't&#xD;
never forgive you, no never ! not to my dyin' day!"&#xD;
She stalked stiffly out of the room, and her heavy steps sound-&#xD;
ed on the stairs, and along the passage above, and the door&#xD;
banged. after her with what dear Charley Lamb used to call "a&#xD;
wooden damn."&#xD;
Mr. Goldsmith's thin hand was by this time brushing his ear,&#xD;
the. buzzing troubled him,:and when it ceased he stood ,motionless&#xD;
and abstracted, gazing at the shears which be ,still 'grasped, till&#xD;
recalled to 'himself by the pressure of Chris's little hands clasping&#xD;
sofly, about his wrist; then he roused and laid away the 'ugly&#xD;
weapons, and smiled fondly upon the rosy fingers, and took them&#xD;
tenderly within his own,.and turning, the two paced slowly up&#xD;
and down the hall together.&#xD;
"I'm afraid I'm but a poor papa after all to this little 'one, this.&#xD;
lovely lady Christabel whom her father loves so well  I've made'&#xD;
plenty of mistakes in my life, but you won't judge me, darling."&#xD;
Chris tried her voice, but there was a swelling in her throat,&#xD;
and she dropped her'face upon, the dear hands which held hers,&#xD;
with one df her pretty caresses. She knew intuitively how dis-&#xD;
turbed and agitated he, was, and ishe felt the 'blood leaping hotly&#xD;
along his wrist, and watched. how his features contracted with&#xD;
pain, and noted that he walked with a. hand pressed 'tightly over'&#xD;

his heart; and she tried bravely to keep down her sobs while she&#xD;
fastened her eyes upon his haggard face.&#xD;
They two had their solitary tea together, the good wife refusing.&#xD;
to come down; she could be sulky and sullen as well as vindic-.&#xD;
tive. So Chris made the tea and toasted the bread, and after-&#xD;
wards she nestled up to her papa on the library sofa; and he&#xD;
talked ,tenderly and lovingly to her, coiling her curls about his&#xD;
thin fingers, and he held her close and sang to her, and at bed-&#xD;
time she kaelt by his side and offered her evening prayer as was&#xD;
her habit, and he fervently joined his petitions with hers, in so&#xD;
child-like, trusting a way, as brought them in, closer harmony,&#xD;
and also clearly proved that whatever false steps he might have&#xD;
made in hisshort life, and sudden trippings, he loved .the dear&#xD;
Christ who bears our griefs and carries our sorrows; who remem-&#xD;
brs that we are but poor creatures, full of mistakes and lame-&#xD;
endeavors, but in his great love and condescension will take us&#xD;
"just as we are."  It seemed impossible for poor Fred to part&#xD;
with;his daughter, and he recalled. her again and again, aird held&#xD;
her to his heart, and she felt warm tears on her cheek as he&#xD;
coupled.-her, name and Chandy's ina last blessing...&#xD;
" God will take care of you," said he; "always remember how&#xD;
much your poor papa loved you."&#xD;
After she went away, weeping silently, he walked slowly up to&#xD;
his wife's, room and knocked, and called her by name. He got&#xD;
no reply, and; softly lifted the latch-it was fastened. He hesita-&#xD;
ted a moment, and the blood mounted hotly in his cheeks. He&#xD;
spoke again.. She within felt a meantriumph that he without&#xD;
should stand and ask for admission ; she kept stubborn silence, and&#xD;
he went slowly down again to.the library, and throwing himself on&#xD;
the sofa, he turned his face to the wall. Whether his last thoughts&#xD;
were tender forgiveness for his wife, or a pitiful regret for the lost&#xD;
Eleanor, his God only knows, for Chris found him in the morning&#xD;
dead and cold,.the coil of chestnut hair twisted about his wasted&#xD;
fingers. They told.-her he had disease of the heart.&#xD;
When the child, recovered from the stunning shdck, she found&#xD;
herself alone. The funeral weas ,over and Chandos gone back to&#xD;
&#xD;
school; nobody seemed to mind about her in those first dreary&#xD;
weeks, and she mourned in' silence her irreparable loss. She&#xD;
kept as much as possible out of her mother's way, and got no&#xD;
encouragement of look or tone to approach her; and she went&#xD;
over the favorite haunts which her papa's presence had made so&#xD;
charming to her, and in the soft autumn weather she was often&#xD;
out from sunrise till twilight, without remark. Sometimes she&#xD;
locked herself into the library, and tried to study and sketch as&#xD;
she thought he would have had her. She took up her lessons&#xD;
where he had ended them, and struggled hard in all things to&#xD;
raise herself up to his standard, always alone. She never told a&#xD;
soul what'she had heard, but buried it deep in her breast. The&#xD;
memory never left her, and it kept her shy, silent, and reserved.&#xD;
Poor friendless little Chris !&#xD;
"She felt the mother-want about the world,&#xD;
And still went seeking like a bleating lamb&#xD;
Left out at night in shutting up the fold.&#xD;
As restless as a nest-deserted bird,&#xD;
Grown chill through something being away,&#xD;
Though what, it knows not."&#xD;
Mrs. Goldsmith soon turned to her schemes and her savings&#xD;
which should make Chandos rich. She sold all the plants out of&#xD;
the green-houses and turned them into hen-coops and raised eggs&#xD;
for the Gonecussets. Thomas took the whole of the flowers and&#xD;
gave them plenty of room in the Craigenfell's conservatories, just&#xD;
as his master would have ordered had he been at home.&#xD;
" They be all yours, sweet little maid," said he to Chris, "all&#xD;
the same as ever; and I'll be your old gardener, and tend them&#xD;
for you, and you'll come up and see them sometimes, aid Deb&#xD;
shall make frost-cakes and cherry-pats for you. Ah, my own&#xD;
dear Bessie," he added aside, "the daisies 'l be springing above&#xD;
your pretty head, and no child-music more in the house."&#xD;
Mrs. Goldsmith also drove Chris out of the studio, and double-&#xD;
locked the doors; and she went to more lectures, and missionary&#xD;
societies, and began a new course of reading, of which " The&#xD;

tracts, ",Run and Speak to that Young Man," " The Door to the&#xD;

her creed in order to preserve her spiritual' equilibrium. She&#xD;
avoided all the beautiful,'sweet, tender delights of our dear reli-&#xD;
gioi, and reveled in thundering and curses ; and her increasing&#xD;
devotion did not beautify her visage, or inolify her temper, which&#xD;
on the contrary :got daily grimer and sourer. She'had no sum-&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER THIRD.&#xD;
THE HORSE SHOE.&#xD;
&#xD;
IT was snowing very fast, and no one who could remain in&#xD;
doors thought of stirring out. Every thing looked desolate and&#xD;
forlorn. All .the naked trees stood up and waved their arms&#xD;
about, gaunt and forbidding. The houses looked black and de-&#xD;
serted. The streets were in that uncomfortable state  of sloppi-&#xD;
ness which somebody has called "two slumps to one sposh and a&#xD;
spatter." A great tortoise-shell cat was :out in it, crossing the&#xD;
road-shaking his paws and picking his way daintily-perrowing&#xD;
as he disappeared under the picket fence and was let in through a&#xD;
tiny crack of the kitchen door by Christabel 'Goldsmith, who had&#xD;
been watching him. Ruth Blair had also been watching him&#xD;
through the clean, bright window of her cottage, which the little&#xD;
woman would persist in calling '&amp;amp; The Horse Shoe."&#xD;
Within it was bosy and complete, and the youthful matron&#xD;
thought how comfortable it looked, as she seated herself before&#xD;
the nice wood fire and began nursing her very pretty baby. The&#xD;
furniture was tastefully arranged and neatly dusted, the gay rag&#xD;
carpet cleanly swept, the boy good-humored and agreeable.;- In&#xD;
fact he was composing himself, or being composed by ceaseless&#xD;
trotting, which the cheerful rosy-cheeked mother commenced as&#xD;
soon as she seated herself, while she sang what she- had so often&#xD;
sung before as to have gotten together quite a rhythmical lullaby&#xD;
-which was as composing to the youngster as a sleep-powder to&#xD;
a fine lady:&#xD;

" The cricket sings under the hearth,&#xD;
The bird is asleep on the tree,&#xD;
The owl comes out, and stares about,&#xD;
Some poor little mouse to see.&#xD;
But- my baby lies snug and close,&#xD;
His curly pate on my arm,&#xD;
And his cunning little dimpled toes&#xD;
Stuck out to the fire to warm;&#xD;
Trot, trot, hum, hum,"&#xD;
Stuck-out to the fire to warm,"&#xD;
She was nursing herfirst man-child. None but a young mother&#xD;
can fully comprehend the soul-full joy which welled up in her&#xD;
heart' and beautified: her life. She had to suffer privation and&#xD;
fatigue in her devotion to the boy; she must sit often in the.fad-&#xD;
ing twilight, that time of gay neighborhood visiting in which&#xD;
young village maidens so much delight, hushing the cries and ad-.&#xD;
ministering to the, needs of the little one, when she used in the&#xD;
days of light-hearted girlhood to be abroad, enjoying the fresh,&#xD;
cool air. She must deny herself many of the free pleasures of*&#xD;
the life she had laid down -and turned her back upon; but she&#xD;
cast no sighs after them, her new happiness was so absorbing in.&#xD;
its rich fruition.&#xD;
The rocking and trotting and cooing lullaby had the desired&#xD;
effect; "Pigeon" had already closed his eyes, and Was sinking&#xD;
away into a soft, happy, slumber, and Ruth watched his gentle&#xD;
breathing, which parted his pretty lips and disclosed his four little&#xD;
white teeth, with pardonable young-mother rapture. The hush-&#xD;
iag refrain was subsiding into a prolonged "hum-m-m-m," and she&#xD;
was just gathering the -child together in her arms, preparatory to&#xD;
laying. him in his crib, when there sounded a soft, hesitating,&#xD;
doubtful. rapping on the kitchen door; timid and low as it was,&#xD;
Pigeon heard it, and started up directly, wide-awake}and curious,&#xD;
so Ruth Blair was.forced to take .him on her arm and open the&#xD;
door   Her young husband was only a journeyman blacksmith,&#xD;
4o she kept no servants, and dear little Pigeon was not given&#xD;
over to the strange devices of any Irish irresponsible, bent on&#xD;
finding "aise,' and covering her shortcomings with blarney; con-'&#xD;
&#xD;
sequently cunning little Pigeon had a happy, fearless look, which&#xD;
the poor little inhabitants of gorgeous third-story nurseries often&#xD;
make us yearn to see on their pinched, pale, dreary little faces.&#xD;
Mama in her drawing-room vaunts to her visitors the treasure&#xD;
she has in Bridget--" so devoted to my baby," says she, " she&#xD;
worships the child !" Ah, if poor baby could only talk, what a&#xD;
different; tale she would tell; her frightened eyes tell it now, and&#xD;
the hopeless despair in her old. little face, when she is carried&#xD;
away. But the visitors are too busy admiring.the "riotous nee-&#xD;
dIe-work " on her dress to observe it, and the mama sends her off&#xD;
with a hasty dismissal, and "entertains" her= guests.&#xD;
The open door let in a rough blast which. shook up Pigeon's.&#xD;
curls rarely, and filled his 'eyes with tears, and ,also whisked up&#xD;
all the window shades ; and it disclosed a little shivering figure,&#xD;
which judging from the breadth of his garments ought to have&#xD;
been manly, but as he failed in stature, his apparel was rolled over&#xD;
and over on his legs and arms, in order that they might get out&#xD;
far enough for locomotive and other practical purposes.. Iish, of&#xD;
the florid 'type, *as- written all over him; there was. the Wide.&#xD;
hanging mouth, the pale, watery eyes, stiff, red hair, the freckled&#xD;
visage, spotted and sun-baked. Not beautiful nor interesting, but&#xD;
he was ragged, dirty, and half frozen, a childish "miserable" to&#xD;
make the heart ache, and of'ill things to be seen in Roaring&#xD;
River, not the vestige of a stocking on his purple, filthy feet.&#xD;
He held a white pitcher in his chapped hands, all seained and&#xD;
grimed, and he pushed it toward Ruth, with a look in her face&#xD;
half beseeching, half'impudent&#xD;
"Could you be plase to spare me mother a°sup of milk, ma'ani,&#xD;
for the new baby, and it's the rest of us'll be takin' a drop along&#xD;
wid it, an' ye'll be so motherly tinder as to gi\e it; tois ?"&#xD;
" Whose child are you ?" asked Ruth, eyeing' the knowing,&#xD;
hard young face, turned fearlessly up to hers, With little favor.&#xD;
Where do you come froin?"  Then glancing .down;at the bare&#xD;
feet standing in the muddy splash, she added quickly::&#xD;
"Good gracious, boy, why don't you come in out of- tlat'" and&#xD;
she pulled him by his big sleeve, he coming rather unwillingly,&#xD;

&#xD;
not to say proudly, and shut the door,;and seated him before the&#xD;
fire in a little willow rocking-chair. (It was to be Pigeon's chair&#xD;
as soon as he grew to it, purchased by the young couple with the&#xD;
rest qf their plenishing. George would buy -it, and insisted that&#xD;
it looked suggestive and comfortable,.even if they never got any&#xD;
use for it.)  The new incumbent seemed to find it a pleasantten-&#xD;
ure, to judge from his relaxing muscles, which thawed in the.&#xD;
genial atmosphere into a broad grin. He stretched out his feet'to&#xD;
the blaze, and wiped his nose by drawing his sleeve across it, and&#xD;
looked hungry eyes at a plate of soda biscuits which were piled&#xD;
white and tempting upon the table for supper. Little Ruth inter-&#xD;
pretingithe glance, gave him one directly, and added a slice of ham&#xD;
as a gentle relish, and stood before him with the blandest of faces,&#xD;
while he devouredit with such fierce eagerness as proved that; ham&#xD;
sandwiches and -he were not upon such terms of acquaintanceas&#xD;
to have begotten contempt by familiarity. She handed another&#xD;
and another as -fast as he bestowed them. He had his fingers on&#xD;
the fifth, but drew back his hand.&#xD;
"Oh, the saints forgive ye, Dennis Eagan," muttered he, "for&#xD;
the mean little-divil that ye care, busy cramming :yoursel' like a&#xD;
turkey for Christmas,.and Sonsie starvin' wid the hunger; but .&#xD;
couldn''t:help it-ma'am indeed."&#xD;
"And who is Sonsie ?" said Ruth pleasantly: "come tell me&#xD;
about her."&#xD;
" She's me sister, is Sonsie. Ye never seen ,such :a sister:as&#xD;
she is, rna'am."&#xD;
With this introduction Ruth got from him a little story, told in&#xD;
the quaiit andoften poetical language which these Emeralds use&#xD;
as if they had been playfellows of Ossian. Misfortune, suffering&#xD;
and want, mingled with crime perhaps-,nothing new 'or strange&#xD;
to the dwellers in cities, but with which Roaring River was only&#xD;
beginning to' make unwilling acquaintance. Such a quiet, old-&#xD;
fashioned town as it was beforefactory times, and in the center&#xD;
of so rich a farming country; 'though 'the -inhabitants heard of&#xD;
want and misery by the hearing of the ear,-actual, gaunt, hideous&#xD;
starvation had hid her grim visage' from their gaze. Let us be&#xD;
&#xD;
thankful that there are still a few such blessed places left in our&#xD;
charming State, though the people run to and fro, and knowledge&#xD;
is increased. Now a new railroad had been projected through&#xD;
the village,:the Gonecussets being 'the head and front of the en-&#xD;
terprise, and theyhad kept Mr. John Bisbee at the capitol lobby-&#xD;
ing to push it through all the last sitting. of the Legislature, and&#xD;
folks said : they had spent a pile of money in- the form of a cor-&#xD;
ruption fund. It was surveyed to cross the quiet old grassy&#xD;
square, the pride of the village, and shooting past the corner of&#xD;
the old' stonechurch,:among the grave stones, it .ran into the fine&#xD;
farms, and. cut and slashed' and kicked up the ancient landmarks&#xD;
in a way which I am afraid induced some profanity among, the&#xD;
:sufferers. But then, it would be a great advantage;to the, Gone-&#xD;
cussets, making easy transit for their scythes and sattinets, and&#xD;
the aggrieved outsiders had to swallow down their wrath and&#xD;
pocket their damages as best they might. Now did the Irish&#xD;
pour in and plant themselves, and stick up their shanties, and rear&#xD;
their illegant pigs and children after'-their peculiarly tidy fashion.&#xD;
This boy, Dennis' Eagan,:belonged to the last horde of voters;&#xD;
his father had work on the road, he had got hurt, they lived under&#xD;
the hill close by Gully Brook. There were five children, and&#xD;
the new babby, but the babby wan't their's ; the mother brought&#xD;
it home in a blanket. This washthe synopsis of the tale Ruth&#xD;
heard.&#xD;
"And me, mother says' we won't have a daddy long," he&#xD;
added. "He's stopping to whoam now very bad in his head;&#xD;
she's went for the auld doether till him, but he didn't come yet,&#xD;
and she s fretting the heart, out for it. If ye would but. comfort&#xD;
me mother, ma'am, a bit,' he finished, looking into Ruth's bright&#xD;
face with all the childish confidence.its truth commanded.&#xD;
She smiled. " Do you think I could comfort your pooranother,&#xD;
my lboy ?"&#xD;
"Indade but it's just you that can do that same; haven't you&#xD;
comforted meself through and through, intirely ?"&#xD;
There was such:an admixture of old cunning and young £ith&#xD;
in the odd nut-cracker of a face she looked .down at,}that -uh&#xD;

hesitated. " Maybe all a lie," she thought ; "no, it's truth," she&#xD;
concluded; "I'm sure of"it."  The mental process by which she&#xD;
arrived at this  certainty does not 'appear; but she moved away&#xD;

duck legs will carry you; and; mind you don't spill the milk. But&#xD;
stop! that won't do, either. You shan't"stir till you have those&#xD;
&#xD;
horrible, dirty, purple feet covered up. I should suppose you&#xD;
would wash them once in a while ; but poor fellow, I' dare say&#xD;
you think a great deal more about something to put into your&#xD;
crop than 'about soap and water. -Cleanliness is next. to godliness,&#xD;
but an empty stomach does not beget a love for either. 'I haven't&#xD;
a thing you can wear unless it is that pair of Chandy Goldsmith's&#xD;
old shoes which Chris wore over here that day when she had 'lost&#xD;
her 'gums,' as the Philadelphia ladies call their rubbers. Maybe&#xD;
with a pair of George's woolen socks they might do-a mile too&#xD;
large, of course, but anything is better 'than raked goose-flesh&#xD;
like that. Can you keep them on.?" she was bending over Den-&#xD;
nis, with her plump hands resting on her knees, and watching&#xD;
with a busy face the process of induction.&#xD;
"Indade then, but I .can, ma'ain  my feet can laugh at the&#xD;
snow in there, and me gatherin' the sticks. Mother will be very&#xD;
phased ; she fretted sorely to see me futs bleeding and she niver&#xD;

"Thank you, master Eagan, and tell your mother that I'll be&#xD;
down to see her as soon as I can leave home." i.&#xD;
She held open the door, and 'the little fellow walked. carefully&#xD;
away, .clasping the pitcher with both hands, and lifting his feet&#xD;
like a ducI to keep his boots on. Everything is valuable by&#xD;

through it all, and lost her trouble, from "The cricket sings under&#xD;

thoughts were- busy over the probable' condition of the poor&#xD;
wretches thus thrust upold her notice.&#xD;
"Always poor Irish," said she; "how I should like to see a&#xD;

with a soft sigh, as she laid Pigeon in his little crib, snug and&#xD;
comfortable ; contrary to all hat blessed youngster's intentions,.he&#xD;
had gone to sleep, and his lips were so very;bewitching in their&#xD;
dewy rosiness that the young mother could not help tasting them&#xD;
once more before she really left him to his slumbers. He was&#xD;
good and fast for two hours or more, and so she looked into he&#xD;
pantry for any odd bits she could spare. It was better filled than&#xD;
Mother.Hubbard's, but still not sumptuous. A piece of beef-steak&#xD;
left from dinner, a few stewed potatoes, and a nice pot cheese.&#xD;
She added some .sices of bread, and laid the whole deftly into&#xD;
a basket, holding converse ,with herself as she covered them in.&#xD;
"Fleuwis high, and ours .is almost out. 'I wish the prophet&#xD;
would"come along, but, then I don't suppose he would do anything&#xD;
for me if he did ; he would save all the nice things for the widows.&#xD;

whatever -you do. I suppose your guardian angel will watch&#xD;
over youin:my absence ; if he won't, I don't see the use of hav-&#xD;
ing one."&#xD;
She hurried onher hood and cloak, and sallied out,  She had&#xD;
not far to walk, down a lane, and with her active, quick, steps she&#xD;
soon reached the place. It had been the old red.school-house for&#xD;
the last generation of Merry =Bank youngsters, but was abandoned&#xD;
as too rickety and tunible-down. The boys, that type of human.-&#xD;
ity whose hand is against every man, had amused their leisure by&#xD;
throwing stones at the windows, and all the glass had long ago&#xD;
been, shivered and trodden under foot, and boards, paper, and rags&#xD;
supplied its place. A faint smoke crept out of the ragged chim-&#xD;
ney, arnd a dull odor of greasy cookery lay on the damp -air.&#xD;
"They've got a fire, at all events," said Ruth, shifting her&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLD5sTH's DAUGHTEU.3&#xD;
&#xD;
basket, which was getting heavy ; "it's something to know they&#xD;
are not freezing as well as starving; one luxury at a time."&#xD;
She was startled into a sudden stop by a scream of painrfrom&#xD;
a childish voice which :smote her ears like a blow. The tender&#xD;
mother-heart stirred within her, and she. listened breathless; shud-.&#xD;
dering and pulling her mantle : lightly around her, she fairly ran&#xD;
till she reached the old house, and pushing. open the door, she&#xD;
darted in. A.puff of filthy air rushed out at her, and made her&#xD;
gasp, but she saw such a sight of misery as made her count it for&#xD;
nothing. A woman sat by the stoveholding a child fifteen months&#xD;
or so old; she had on an old piece of a shawl pinned beneat her&#xD;
chin, and was evidently just come in. She was tryinii with a&#xD;
bit of rag to stop the .blood :from a wicked gash in the child's&#xD;
forehead, and a wide cut on its cheek.&#xD;
"What is the matter here !" screamed Ruth. "What ails that&#xD;
poor child ?"&#xD;
The woman turned her head at the voice, and showed a face&#xD;
pale, dirty, care-worn, woe-begone, with all the soul tarredd and&#xD;
pinched out of it-a pitiful face to see.&#xD;
"She's fell ontil the stove,, ma'am," she said, in a half-dead way.&#xD;
"While I was for the doctor to ,me husband, it happened somehow;&#xD;
she's cut all the headband face of her, }and harted hersef dread-&#xD;
ful; I don't know what I'm to do any more, I'm.sure,",and.she&#xD;
glanced around the hole of a place in a kind of dazed, sorrowful&#xD;
consternation. Quite un-Irish like, she, :made no, outcry, uttered&#xD;
no shrieks, but sat dull-still, sapping', the dripping wounds. All&#xD;
the life deemed gone from herhollow face and sunken eyes-the&#xD;
fountain of tears dried up.&#xD;
Ruth glanced hurriedly about her in.;search of after ; she saw&#xD;
none. In a corner, rolled up in a tattered quilt, Jay.a ma ,ppa-&#xD;
rently asleep, and breathing stertorioely. She thought he was&#xD;
drunk, and called:ogt sharply:&#xD;
"Jump up, man, get some water, quick! Don't you see how&#xD;
your child is suffering?  Don't you hear ier screams ? How can&#xD;
you lie.stupid, like that ?"&#xD;

"he's hurt hisself out on the cutting, worse luck; a blast hit him;&#xD;
he hadn't the sense into him when they got 'im home; he's been&#xD;
breathing that same way all the while. Oh! laut the troubles is&#xD;
sore and heavy for us," she moaned to herself as she drew her&#xD;
bloody hand across her tearless eyes. "Holy Mary pity us!&#xD;
Ruth placed her basket hastily on the floor, no table being vis-&#xD;
ible; and if truth must be told of the dear little woman, she felt&#xD;
not a little ashamed of the scolding tone she had been uing in&#xD;
this poor place where there was suffering enough without adding&#xD;
any hard words.&#xD;
"Like my stupidity," said she, "to forget the tale about the&#xD;
sick daddy." After a perplexed look at her spotless dress, she&#xD;
seated herself on a box by the stove, and took the filthy bundle&#xD;
of rags, which gave out no pleasant odor, from the unresisting&#xD;
mother, and tenderly bound up the suffering little creature's&#xD;
wounds with her handkerchief, and smiling into the wondering&#xD;
eyes lifted to hers, she soon bad a quiet baby lying passive in her&#xD;
motherly arms, and it was'so natural for her to croon her lullaby&#xD;
that unconsciously she commenced: "The cricket sings under the&#xD;

etarmof her pleasant voice, I cannot tell, but in a few moments&#xD;
the little one was fast asleep.&#xD;
" There," said Ruth to herself, " who says I'm not an animal&#xD;

where, and pinching want showed obtrusively-but no babby.&#xD;
'Now that the shrieks were hushed, she heard" a feeble wail pro-&#xD;
ceeding from the cradle, which might seem to indicate that there&#xD;
was the'commencement of an:immortality in its-immediate vicinity.&#xD;
" Me sister's babbyma'am," said Mrs. Eagan, following the- di-&#xD;
rection 'of 'Ruth'seyes-(shesat listlessly huggingher arms; since&#xD;
their burden had' been removed.)  "She's gone away and leaved&#xD;
it behind her, r'ore's the pity.~ Oh the dear saints pray for us,&#xD;
but it's hard that the cruel world is for the likes of us, anyhow.",&#xD;
"Gone!" said Ruth, sharply; "where,--pray.?" her intolerant&#xD;
mood returning with this announcement of unmotherly desertion.&#xD;
" To heaven, I hope, ma'am; she's dead this day week."&#xD;
She' rose, stepped to the cradle, and drew down the dirty blan-&#xD;
ket. There lay, sure enough, a tiny slip of a baby.- Ruth placed&#xD;
her sleeping charge- upon the straw in the corner, close to the&#xD;
wounded man, and came and bent over the little -creature, all the&#xD;
mother welling up in her heart as she did so.&#xD;
'"Poor helpless thing," said she, her eyes dropping teats; "and&#xD;
its mother is dead."&#xD;
" Yes ma'am, she's gone-; and it's I've got the babby to rear,&#xD;
though it's the Holy Mary only knows how I'm to do it. And&#xD;
just look, ma'am, naked as it came into the world! dear little in-&#xD;

"No clothes !" exclaimed Ruth, aghast. The little old-looking&#xD;
wrinkled thing lay writhing and twisting and purple in the frag-&#xD;

"Indade, never a rag.. It came too soon, and sorra a bit could&#xD;

"Have you tried to get any work ?" askea Ruth, covering in&#xD;
the baby with tender hands.&#xD;
"IUve washed twict for Mrs. Williams, but she didn't give me&#xD;
Money, only some cold pieces, and some old duds she said would&#xD;

Mrs. Blair bethought her of her basket, and brought forth the&#xD;
Mother Hubbard store. The huddle behind the stove broke up&#xD;
on the 'instant ; they scented the viands afar-off, and little eager&#xD;
faces gathered around her, eager with starvation.&#xD;
"Oh dear !" thought Ruth,'her nose going up in spite of her,&#xD;
she was such a dainty, clean little woman, "if you could only&#xD;

after a weary waiting she turned slowly away and laid the morsel&#xD;

&#xD;
* The door burst open, and our little friend Dennis staggered in,&#xD;
bending under his load of sticks, which he dropped with a weary&#xD;
groan on to the f oor. He was followed by a young girl, ragged&#xD;
and dirty.; -she was thin and pale, but erect as a }reed, and. with a&#xD;
certain sense of power in her motions. She had a shock of pur-&#xD;
ple-black hair, and great hollow eyes ; she was shivering and&#xD;
blue with cold, but an air of courageous endurance sat on- her&#xD;
face, and she spoke in an honest, cheery voice.&#xD;
" Look, mother ! look, children! what i've brought to you. A.&#xD;
girl of me own age guy it me ; she's as pretty as beads, and the&#xD;
sweet pity and dear kindness :in her brown eyes were better&#xD;
than it. She's not happy either, I'm sure, poor., dear; i.should&#xD;
like to beat somebody for it. Come, mother, a whole loaf of&#xD;
white bread and seed-cakes, she called them  'cookies' And&#xD;
here's Dennis, he's worked like a brave old hero, as he is--we'ye&#xD;
to eat, and we've the wood for the Oire."  Here she stopped short,&#xD;
perceiving Ruth, and smiled, nothing abashed.&#xD;
"Dennis' friend, I know and Pigeon's mama," said she, curte-&#xD;
sying. "I am Sonsie, 'at your service, and blessings on ye for&#xD;
the purty little lady that ye be. Dennis is raving ever since&#xD;
about ye, ma'am; he'll stand on his head if ye but bid him do it.&#xD;
And how is father ? Is the doctor corned yet ?"&#xD;
"He's niver been at all. It's two good hours sen I was up at&#xD;
his place. I could not .get to speech of himself, but I left the&#xD;
word as that me Dennis was hurted, and begged he'd come im-&#xD;
mediate."&#xD;
Just then the man in the straw groaned heavily, and struggled&#xD;
for breath, tossed up his arms, and opened wide :his staring blood-&#xD;
shot eyes. They moved quickly toward him, but the great-blue&#xD;
orbs which want had set in such deep caverns were already fixed&#xD;
and glassy in the last agony ; his purple, swollen lips drew back&#xD;
from his set teeth, his features contracted in a fearful spasm--and&#xD;
he was dead.&#xD;
The hapless widow stood gazing .at him=in a:half daft, uncon-&#xD;
scious way, out of her tearless, sunken eyes,\till the truthrsank&#xD;
into her heart ; 'then she dropped beside the body, with her head&#xD;

on her knees, and her hands clasped around them, and rocked&#xD;
herself to and fro.&#xD;
" Oh, but it's lonely I'll be now," she moaned in a smothered&#xD;
voice, "lonely all the life long. Ye were the good husband to&#xD;
me,- Dennis, darlint, and ye loved me dear, in all the want.and&#xD;
the sorrow. Oh, why did ye lave the auld cabin under the hill,&#xD;
for to die. away among the strangers?  Better to starve there&#xD;
amongst the kindred and get a burying' in the auld church-yard&#xD;
with the white cross at ye'r head and the daisies springing above&#xD;
ye, and the golden finches building their nests around, than to&#xD;
break your kind heart in this miserable country, where's no pity&#xD;
at all for the poor ! Oh, Mary ! Mother of Jesus ! take us all,&#xD;
and let us rest together. It's weary that I am, with the strug-&#xD;
glin' and the starvin', and better all die now ; there's no comfort&#xD;
for the likes of us but the cold comfort that's under the sod."&#xD;
"Mother, mother !" said Sonsie, leaning over the sobbing crea-&#xD;
ture with a protecting gesture which seemed habitual to her, and&#xD;
forcing down her own grief. "Don't take on; you've the chil-&#xD;
dren to mind; they're frighted of you."&#xD;
"Poor soul!' said Ruth, with heavenly pity in her eyes;&#xD;
"you've a friend who always feels for you-the dear Christ.&#xD;
Don't forget in your sorrow that you've a Saviour to go to."&#xD;
" Thrue, thrue, there's a God above us, but he don't. seem to&#xD;
mind us in the heart-breakin' and suffering . Holy Mary, pray&#xD;
for us!"&#xD;
"Let us pray for ourselves," said Ruth, in a soft whisper, lay-&#xD;
ing her hand gently upon the clenched ones at her side. "Let&#xD;
us ask the good Jesus; 'He will surely hear us, and pity us; He&#xD;
knows our griefs, for-He carried our sorrows."&#xD;
The womin started at the sympathetic touch, and threw a be-&#xD;
wildered glanceup at the gentle eyes seeking hers ; and she kept&#xD;
almost breathless silence while Ruth, kneeling, prayed in simple&#xD;
words for just what the crushed- soul needed. The bleeding.&#xD;
heart,;gall blurred- and darkened, felt the healing balm of true&#xD;
prayer,'and when Ruth rose she put out both of her hands, to&#xD;
touch her garments.&#xD;

"It's, a gleam of God's blessed sunshine that ye.are !" said she&#xD;
reverently. " Ye've put the warm life into me dead heart. Holy&#xD;
Mary bless ye for it."&#xD;
" Take courage, and don't let us'talk any more about giving&#xD;
up with so good and great a friend to go to, and who loves us,&#xD;
too. I hate to leave you in your grief, but I must run home&#xD;
to my. baby. I'll'try to send some of our good neighbors to see&#xD;
you, and I feel quite sure my husband will look in to-night, so that&#xD;
you! shall not be alone with your dead."&#xD;
As she turned to the door, she felt her hand clasped, and'look-&#xD;
ing down she found the girl Sonsie on her knees at her side; she&#xD;
was pressing the plump fingers she held to her lips, and Ruth&#xD;
was startled by the look of unutterable devotion, almost adora-&#xD;
tion, which shone from her great hollow eyes. , She smiled en-&#xD;
couragingly upon her, though her heart. was aching with sympa-&#xD;
thetic sorrow.&#xD;
"You have your hands full now, Sonsie," whispered she.&#xD;
"Comfort the poor mother ; 'tis a breaking heart. You must&#xD;
stand in front; you are young and strong and full of hope. You&#xD;
must tidy up the place, too, before anybody comes."&#xD;
Sonsie nodded and smiled as she. dashed off a-couple of tears.&#xD;
"I'll do me best," said she ; "I always do."&#xD;
Ruth met the doctor coming leisurely along. He had dined,&#xD;
 and read the Times and the World, and was sauntering at art-&#xD;
easy pace, as he turned Marble's editorial over in his mind, and&#xD;
chewed the end of his tooth-pick along with his cud of reflections.&#xD;
This call of charity needed no hurry.- Ruth stopped him, and&#xD;
related the catastrophe, and then walked swiftly home to her&#xD;
sleeping Pigeon, who had not stirred in his nest. The doctor&#xD;
took a look at the corpse, lifted one leg, passed his fingers across&#xD;
the back, peered under the eyelids, and remarked calmly to hiim-&#xD;
self:&#xD;
"Spine fractured; might have lived on awhile, perhaps, with&#xD;
prime nursing, but hadn't the ghost of a chance ever to get on&#xD;
his legs again-better dead than alive."  And he turned about&#xD;

and brushing offt some specks of dirt from his- immaculate coat-&#xD;
sleeve, he said:&#xD;
"I'll look up the town authorities and have the poor devil&#xD;
buried, and the rest taken out to the farm,"-and then he drew on&#xD;
his gloves and proceeded on his round with unabated cheerfulness.&#xD;
He did not observe the indignant scorn in Sonsie's pale face, or&#xD;
her clenched hands; he wouldn't have minded.such small deer if&#xD;
he had.&#xD;
The town buried the remains the next day, but 'it was with a&#xD;
sore heart that the poor widow saw them laid in unconsecrated&#xD;
ground, and without a Priest's blessing, and she begged hard to&#xD;
wait for his coming. The town-officers made pishawing remarks&#xD;
among themselves at the idiocy of such a request, and hustled&#xD;
them into the rough box prepared for the parish dead. "They&#xD;
rattled the 'bones over the stones," they too were of the opinion&#xD;
that he was better dead than alive. The widow did what she&#xD;
could; she nailed together with her own hands a rude cross, which&#xD;
she planted at the grave-head with many prayers and tears.&#xD;
Ruth Blair was busy all day about the funeral; but before she&#xD;
slept that night she gathered together all she could spare of Pig-&#xD;
'eon's clothes and her baby-linen and carried them to Mrs. Eagan,&#xD;
whose face lighted at the sight of her. She found her sitting by&#xD;
the little hurt child, watching its heavy slumber, and Sonsie hush-&#xD;
ing the baby with motherly tenderness. They 'both had turned&#xD;
their backs upon the corner where the ghastly corpse had so&#xD;
lately lain, and the children were all asleep under the quilt which&#xD;
had covered it. The place was swept and scrubbed, and Sonsie's&#xD;
face was polished"to the hue'of clear marble, and her eyes glowed&#xD;
more lustrous than ever. The wounds on the child's forehead&#xD;
were still'bound about with Ruth's handkerchief, which adhered&#xD;
tightly, but her face aid hands were washed. The wan - little&#xD;
features looked so pinched, and blue that Ruth's sympathetic heart&#xD;
ached while she looked. She slept like a log, and breathed hard&#xD;
with her lips apart, and her half-open eyes rolled painfully upward-.&#xD;
"rHoW h s she been, Mrs. Eagan?  Did she take any of her&#xD;
gruel ?" . /&#xD;

. "A little, ma'am; she was tossin' and turning' all the mornin',&#xD;
but for a good bit since she's been sleepin' as you see. She&#xD;
makes a moan onct in a while, but she don't open her eyes no&#xD;
more, nor mind me spakin' to her."&#xD;
The children about the stove, awakened either by Ruth's cheery&#xD;
voice, or the odor of the warm bread and milk she had brought,&#xD;
all crawled out from their covering and gathered around the&#xD;
smoking basin. The contents dealt out into the cracked bowl&#xD;
and tin cup, were immediately disti-ibuted; theyeagerly supped&#xD;
it up and crept back to bed. Then after some kind talk with the&#xD;
two watchers, which did them good like a cordial, and a promise&#xD;
to come again in the morning, she ran all the way to her own&#xD;
cheerful home, and her dear Pigeon waiting in his father's arms.&#xD;
She found thetwo gazing into the maple-wood fire, on the clean&#xD;
hearth-stone, as if not only "the bonny bairn was biggin castles&#xD;
in the coals," but the merry giant, his papa, was helping him.&#xD;
She burst in upon them all aglow, like 'a gay whirlwind, and rap-&#xD;
turously hugged and kissed them both, with tears in her eyes;&#xD;
and then bustled about, mixing the buckwheat cakes, grinding 'the&#xD;
coffee for the early breakfast, finishing up odds and ends of work&#xD;
before she sat down to the cooing lullaby Pigeon loved-.&#xD;
"The cricket sings under the hearth,&#xD;
The bird is asleep on the tree."&#xD;
And before many minutes the dear little fellow'was fast also,&#xD;
and the young couple composed themselves for what Ruthie'was&#xD;
accustomed to call "the pinch of comfort," one of the precious&#xD;
home evenings when the world is shut 'out and the beloved is&#xD;
shut in. Every true wife can conjure up the picture fromIher&#xD;
own private gallery. The beloved has supped daintily, probably&#xD;
upon those wonderful "puff-overs,' which no one can fabricate' so&#xD;
well as you, embellished with the strawberries which you put up&#xD;
that broiling day last summer, when you expected your remains&#xD;
to be left sublimed on the hearth-stone, like the white earth in&#xD;
the bottom of a crucible, and you consoled yourself during the&#xD;
process 'by the reflection that "dearest Philip dotes upon straw-&#xD;

berries."  While you were in the midst of the pickle, all your&#xD;
energies concentrated upon the preserving kettle, dearest Philip&#xD;
marched manily in, with his spotless wristbands in full display,&#xD;
his soft hat in one hand and his white mouchoir in the other,&#xD;
ejaculating:&#xD;
"Blazes, Martha! what a small inferno you've got here! I&#xD;
don't see how the deuce you stand it !" and then glancing at&#xD;
your crimson finger-tips and berry-stained wrapper, he coolly in-&#xD;
quired "how much wages you wrought for, and whether you stop&#xD;
long in places where they kisses the cook ?" and . then marched&#xD;
chuckling off, leaving your parted-back locks in a semi-perturbed&#xD;
condition, to cool himself with a cigar on the shady, wind-visited&#xD;
piazza.&#xD;
That was last summer--now the curtains are drawn, the tired&#xD;
feet of the beloved repose in the anple slippers you daintily em-&#xD;
.broidered for his birth-day, and were at such a world of trouble&#xD;
to keep secret. His handsome person is enwrapped in the elab-&#xD;
orate dressing-gown which you presented last Christmas, andfor&#xD;
which he paid the New Year's bill with a sly chuckle. His curly&#xD;
.head lies back on the stuffed arm-chair, which you have wheeled&#xD;
up before the fire in the precise spot he loves best. The load of&#xD;
law, or leather, or coal, or cotton, is lifted from'his weary brain.&#xD;
The care-marked lines are smoothing out of his face, which grows&#xD;
expansive and genial in the home glow. And you fold your&#xD;
hands and quietly enjoy looking at him, your own person being&#xD;
neatly arrayed in drab merino, or elegantly in heavy silk, as you&#xD;
can afford, or your circumstances demand, and you make ,the&#xD;
most of the love-light shining from his handsome eyes, while you&#xD;
talk or. keep silence, as your mood rules. You can be happy in&#xD;
these hours without any effort. Ah! these are the joys with&#xD;
which the stranger intermeddleth not..&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER FOURTH.&#xD;
THE B.LAIRS AT BREAKFAST.&#xD;
Mns. BLAIR always rose betimes. Her husband was obliged&#xD;
to go early to-his work ; at six o'clock th'e great bell at the foun-&#xD;
dry clanged out, and woe to the loiterer who was unluckily behind&#xD;
time. Every half hour was counted, and all absences deducted&#xD;
from the week's wages. Mrs. Ruthie was therefore up and bust-&#xD;
ling about almost as soon as the day dawned. She swept the&#xD;
cheerful room, and set the coffee on the fire, and warmed the&#xD;
potatoes, sliced like wafers into, the creamy dressing, and set the&#xD;
table, before she called out at the fpot of the stairs, in the cheeri.&#xD;
est of 'all blithe voices:&#xD;
Come, lazy husband, the sun will, be up before you, unless&#xD;
you look sharp, and there will be odd minutes knocked off your&#xD;
wages, and my new bonnet not bought yet. Do you hear, sir?&#xD;
And mind you tread, softly, and don't stumble over any of the&#xD;
chairs and things, or waken Pigeon with your squeaking boots.&#xD;
I've loads and loads to do this morning."&#xD;
",Yes, yes, my duck, I'll be at your frugal board directly; give&#xD;
a fellow time to brush his teeth, can't you ? And I say, Ruthie,&#xD;
what have you done with my plaid breeches ? togas are not the&#xD;
wear nQw, you know, and I'm blest if I can find' anything to put&#xD;
myself into."&#xD;
"Look on the rocking-chair, stupid; didn't I mend the great&#xD;
hole in the knees last night, after you were lapped in slumber ?"&#xD;

"You borrowed that, George, you lpw'y did ; and it isn't&#xD;
half so good as you could say of yourself.. You don't need to&#xD;
use other people's wits when you've such bright ones, of. your&#xD;
own, I'm sure. Please hurry down, there's a dear fellow. .I do&#xD;
feel so remarkably busy."&#xD;
" Don't be in a pucker, Ruthie. You are always full of work.&#xD;
I expect you are about the busiest little wife in all Millville, ard&#xD;
I kn4 you are ,the very best one-yes, dear,' Roaring River-&#xD;
but I hear so many changes rung on Millville at the foundry:&#xD;
" Oh, were I monarch of the globe,&#xD;
With thee to reign;&#xD;
The brigtest jewel in my crown&#xD;
Wad be my Queen."&#xD;
He was just descending the stairs as he hummed in a rich bar-.&#xD;
itone this exquisite little gem  of Mendellsohn's, and he showed,&#xD;
his face below just as he finished off the "-Queen," with an arioso,&#xD;
G, two octaves below. It was a good face, a very good face-&#xD;
large handsome eyes, an honest, good-humored mouth, firm, deci-'&#xD;
ded, perhaps obstinate, a wealth of hair curling crisp all over his&#xD;
massive head; 'broad-shouldered and muscular in figure, with&#xD;
chest and arm like an athlete in full 'training-no superfluous&#xD;
flesh about him.- He had withal a sweet,, roguish look when he&#xD;
smiled,. which he did pretty often, and his teeth were large and&#xD;
.white and clean. -Somewhat set was the stout feiow in his own&#xD;
way, which he took care to feel sure was a good way, and impa-&#xD;
tient of all, meanness'and cunning. He stood firmly planted on&#xD;
the ground of his own opinion, even if all the world turned away&#xD;
and left him alone. He had a sweet loving. heart, as clean and&#xD;
pure as a vestal virgin's, and his life was above all comment.&#xD;
Great cause had little Ruthie to be proud of George.Blair, the&#xD;
young journeyman blacksmith, foreman of the Gonecusset Scythe&#xD;
Works.                          .-&#xD;
This couple,- seated at their round table, was a sight pleasant&#xD;
to see; such faces are not found under every roof-tree. Ruth&#xD;
poured the 'clear coffee and buttered the cakes, and they ate&#xD;

awhile in silence; and the grosbeak stood still on his top perch&#xD;
with a.red pepper in his stout bill looking down at them. Chris-&#xD;
tabel's cat, who had come over for a little sit-down before the&#xD;
bright fire, v ashed his face all over, and paused with his left paw&#xD;
raised and the tip of his red tongue out, to look at him through&#xD;
half-shut eyes.&#xD;
At length George began to cast inquiring glances at the little&#xD;
wife. Her eyes were fixed on the coffee-pot, as if she were&#xD;
studying the mystery of the steam which curled softly upwards&#xD;
from its bright spout, laden with delicate aroma; and she was&#xD;
balancing her tea-spoon on her plump fore-finger.&#xD;
" Why, Ruth ! what has come -to you?  Do you realize .that&#xD;
you have not. spoken a word to me since I got down stairs?  I&#xD;
hurried down, upon my. word I did."&#xD;
" Have I been silent ?" she replied, laying down her plaything,&#xD;
and smiling into his eyes. "I thought I was sociable ; the truth&#xD;
is, I am thinking a good deal about that -Irish family, and I was&#xD;
casting about in my mind as to who would be most likely to con-&#xD;
tribute .of their substance. There must be-something done im-&#xD;
mediately, or they will proceed to use their inalienable right to&#xD;
starve to death. The Poor Master says he can't do anything'for&#xD;
them unless they will g'o to, the farm, and he 'dunno as She orto&#xD;
let 'em in there, no how.' But the Eagans can't endure the&#xD;
thought of that life; Sonsie says she will work her fingers off-&#xD;
first, and the mother, quiet and wretchel as she is, will 'not give&#xD;
up that slip of a baby, and I must say, George, I honor her for&#xD;
that, don't you?  Of course I know' you do, and I shall push&#xD;
about and try to help her carry out her resolve.' I haven't much&#xD;
time or money to bestow myself; but there are plenty of rich&#xD;
people in Roaring River, to say nothing of smart Millville, and&#xD;
it will go hard but I'll raise a friend among them. If only Mr.&#xD;
Craigenfells was at home, I might begin and end with him, and&#xD;
obtain, all I need. I wish he would come back to his own place,&#xD;
instead'of bui'ying himself in those silver mines; we could better&#xD;
afford to lose the whole of 'the Gonecussets, mueh as they glorify&#xD;
themselves, than one such thorough gentleman as Uncle Alec?'&#xD;

"'Don't speak evil, of the powers that be, duck ; remember&#xD;
where your bread and butter comes from."&#xD;
There was a touch of pride in the head-toss with which Ruth&#xD;
replied to this reproof.&#xD;
" Goon, duck," said George, laughing.&#xD;
"I shall visit Mrs. Goldsmith first ; she always subscribes to&#xD;
all the missionary societies, .and gets up the boxes of clothing for&#xD;
the Indians and negroes, and I am sure these poor souls.are&#xD;
heathenish enough for all practical purposes."&#xD;
"You may spare your breath, duck; I can ensure you before-&#xD;
hand a virtuous refusal. Her piety is of the sour variety,&#xD;
where all the juice is vinegar ; her contributions are for the&#xD;
Herald.&#xD;
"I shall ask her all the same, George; I have made her say&#xD;
'yes' often to my requests for Chris, and' I'll try her on charity&#xD;
now. There's the Bradshaws, and the Walsinghams, and. the&#xD;
Claytons, they will all be sure to give. But do you know,&#xD;
George, I believe I will begin with Mrs. Deacon Williams, and&#xD;
then go through the Gonecussets, before I solicit elsewhere; they&#xD;
are making handfulls of money out of these poor people."&#xD;
" Your husband, the burly blacksmith among the number," said&#xD;
George, with a gay laugh.&#xD;
Ruth glanced quickly at him, and her face, flushed-was it&#xD;
shame or pride ?&#xD;
"They have brought these wretched outcasts among us; and&#xD;
they ought tosupport them, especially this family, since the father&#xD;
met his death in their service ; of course it is their plain duty to&#xD;
pension the widow."&#xD;
" Dear innocent little Ruthie ; I must have you come up to the&#xD;
office next pay-day, and allow you to see how they do'business.&#xD;
I Why, my darling, don't you know that Deacon Williams, pious&#xD;
as he is, would sell his father any time for a dollar, and throw in&#xD;
his mother, also, if necessary to clench his bargain ?"&#xD;
" Oh for shame, George! What a horrid Fejee Islander illus-&#xD;
tration. You shouldn't .drag in his piety that way, as if it was&#xD;
in fault."&#xD;
&#xD;
 "T drag it in just as he does, where he thinks: it will tell-by&#xD;
the head and shoulders. But-inever mind me, Ruthie; you are&#xD;
right I know; I hate to have my wife go begging."&#xD;
"There, sir ! who is proud now ?"&#xD;
" Well, well, try your luck and you'll soon come to be'of my&#xD;
mind ; only you mustn't cry when they are hard on. you, and an-&#xD;
swer you roughly ; you are such a tender heart. I am afraid they&#xD;
will grieve you sorely before you finish. And don't bother your-&#xD;
self too much about these Emeralds.; they don't mind staring&#xD;
any more than eels do skinning ; they are raised on it in the&#xD;
mother country."&#xD;
"Now George, I do really think you are very cruel."&#xD;
She fixed her eyes on her giant reproachfully. "If you had&#xD;
seen the woeful sights I. saw down there, you could not talk so&#xD;
hard."&#xD;
"Ah, woe is me, to see what I see," replied George, with fan-&#xD;
tastic gesture. "Little Ruthie's breakfast getting cold while she&#xD;
scolds her innocent fellow of a husband."&#xD;
"But," persisted Ruth, "suppose that little naked, crying,&#xD;
hungry thing was our baby ?"&#xD;
L"I can't suppose anything of that sort, because our babies are&#xD;
sure to be pretty and well cared for with such a dear little mother.&#xD;
I won't teaze you, duck; you looked so tragie I couldn't help it.&#xD;
But seriously, my wife, the fact is you must not expect any return&#xD;
for all your efforts, except .abuse. You may do your best and&#xD;
they will turn again and rend you, the first opportunity. When&#xD;
you have worn yourself out and exhausted the benevolence of&#xD;
your friends, they will curse you for not doing anything for&#xD;
them. ' A  thankless lot; they talk smoother than oil, but they&#xD;
have all kissed the blarney stone, and are as full of lies and -de-&#xD;
ceit as an egg is of meat. The Irish warm-heartedness and gen-&#xD;
erous impulse is all stuff-a pretty myth. The real paddy-whack&#xD;
and the interesting fellow who is 'sitting on the stile, Mary,' are&#xD;
two extremely dissimilar individuals. Pretty animals they are&#xD;

"Oh you are prejudiced because Michael O'Donohue sold that&#xD;

'Thankless, cheating wretches they were, I'll acknowledge; but&#xD;
they are not a type of my Eagans. I'd engage for that Sonsie&#xD;
anywhere; she's got a fine, true, honest face, worth brightening&#xD;
by kindness; I'll try if I can't bring a little shine into it."&#xD;
Well, dear  little duck, go on' and prosper. It is just as I&#xD;
tell you,'but children are children ; they never asked to be born,&#xD;
and must not be left to suffer, only if any of those Gonecussets&#xD;

"Oh, thank-, you, dear, that will be so nice; in the meantime,&#xD;
please oblige me by dropping in upon Madame Goldsmith and"&#xD;
adjuring and conjuring her to spare Christabel from the 'sewing&#xD;
work' and let; her come over and mind Pigeon for me. The&#xD;

&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH 'S. DAUGHTER.             55&#xD;
It should be said in apology for Mr. Blair, that he had been&#xD;
married scarcely two years, and the first bloom was not yet&#xD;
brushed from his peach of marriedhappiness. The fretting time&#xD;
when 'cares and perplexities make. short words and sour faces,&#xD;
was still far off in the dim distance, in fact did not show a cloud&#xD;
even, the size of a man's hand on his horizon. His busy, fresh,&#xD;
happy little Ruth still adorned herself as carefully for his coming&#xD;
as in the. days of their courtship, a fact, upon which he plumed&#xD;
himself not a little. ."No yellow curl-papers for me, thank you,"&#xD;
he said blandly, as he lifted his hat to Adeliza Euphernia Hitch-&#xD;
cock in passing the dulce domum of that elegant creature, and&#xD;
saw her sitting at the front window in what;she was accustomed&#xD;
to call her dish-able, and he added " Precious Ruthie" before he&#xD;
~began to hum "Oh were I monarch."    They were not at all&#xD;
fashionable people, and had a right to love each other to their&#xD;
heart's content. They were all aldne in the world, fatherless and&#xD;
motherless. When they joyfully agreed to walk through life&#xD;
together, Ruth was teaching the district school in Roaring River,&#xD;
and being young, strong, 'healthy and hopeful, they dared to&#xD;
marry, though George had nothing better to depend upon than&#xD;
his blacksmith's wages. The little wife was a bright particular&#xD;
star in the young husband's eyes, and when at his work her&#xD;
image rose before him, it sent the blood tingling through his veins,&#xD;
and his labor sped merrily. The vision of his pleasant home&#xD;
always nerved his;arm and made him stronger and braver to do&#xD;
battle with the world in general- and the Gonecussets in partic-&#xD;
ular.. When he washed his ruddy face in the brass hand-basin&#xD;
at the forge, and stepped out into the dim twilight for his mile&#xD;
walk, he wassure of a glad welcome from the cheerful woman&#xD;
looking out for him, and listening for the footfall which she knew&#xD;
for his among all the passers by. I expect George would have&#xD;
thought that the time for Satan's thousand years' had about ar-&#xD;
rived if he had' found his house shut up and the fire-shine dark-&#xD;
ened, while his wife gossiped ,and visited among her neigh-&#xD;
bors, or even attended missionary-meetings .or mothers' associa-&#xD;
tions.  Such a fallen being is mAan! so wedded to creature&#xD;
comforts.&#xD;

&#xD;
Many happy evenings had  these Blairs while George read&#xD;
aloud, the baby sleeping in the state of absolute fastness which is&#xD;
so charming in a baby, not ronning up with every sound and de-'&#xD;
manding to, be taken up,'as unprincipled babies who have no&#xD;
regard for the rights of others are in the nightly habit of doing;&#xD;
Ruth with contented face sitting close beside her Giant, working&#xD;
and listening.. Little means had they for luxuries, but they could&#xD;
always afford a new book, if they made up their minds to pos-&#xD;
sess it. And George often said afterwards, when he had learned&#xD;
the bitterest lesson of his life, that the smell of the fresh leaves&#xD;
of a new book, and the rustle of the cutter among them, always&#xD;
brought Ruth before him at her prettiest and best, and showed&#xD;
her in her sweet freshnessand tender truth. They chose to live'&#xD;
simply, and wear the plainest garments, rather that. give up the&#xD;
highest form of happiness within their reach. They not only&#xD;
read together, but talked of what they read, and their every day&#xD;
conversings were enriched by apt quotations from, and playful&#xD;
allusions to their favorite authors, which covered the baldness of&#xD;
the most ordinary topic.&#xD;
George was a thorough mechanic, and could turn his hand to&#xD;
anything, and whlat he finished with his flexible fingers was sure&#xD;
to be something choice of its kind, with his genius-stamp upon&#xD;
it. Indeed he had sought out and perfected many inventions : a&#xD;
patent butter-firkin, for instances with a spring cover, and a con-&#xD;
trivance for tasting, which was bringing a fortune to the live&#xD;
Yankee who bought it ; also a new clothes-wringer, a self-adjusting&#xD;
buckle, which needed no sewing; and he was now busied about&#xD;
a rotary pump which only needed some alteration in the system&#xD;
of packing, (he had puzzled his brains over it and tossed his hair&#xD;
every way,1but could not quite hit it off yet,) to make it the com-&#xD;
pletest kind of a thing.. His thoughts were always working among&#xD;
wheels and levers and screws, while his hands shaped the scythes,&#xD;
and controlled the engines and trip-hammers down-at the foundry.&#xD;
Books were accumulating in their house, the shelves were of black&#xD;
walnut, very ornamental with a carved owl on each.corner, but&#xD;
they would hold no more, and George had his eye upon a new.&#xD;
&#xD;
copy of Dickens in thirty volumes, with the, original Cruikshank&#xD;
illustrations. They needed a book-case ; Ruth said so, with a&#xD;
wistful look at a fine one inBascom &amp;amp; Leary's. A Therefore Mr.&#xD;
Blacksmith made one in the winter evenings, and a gay place it&#xD;
held in the corner of the living-room. It had fluted curtains of&#xD;
crimson silk,-within the carved doors, as George said, 'to defend&#xD;
our treasures from the 'Goths and Vandals." Those ruthless&#xD;
beings who lay lawless hands on the most precious volumes and&#xD;
bear them off to tatterdom without compunctious visitings, and&#xD;
with faces as -serene and unconscious as a well-nursed baby's.&#xD;
Your books in their clutch are like the moments-they go to&#xD;
return no more. I was once asked by one of these harpies, in a&#xD;
voice as smooth and steady as a well executed clarinet obligato,&#xD;
to lend him my copy of Shakspeare! illustrated! illuminated!&#xD;
and bound in antique calf. (A ponderous- volume, which I ap-&#xD;
proach not with unwashen hands, and which I always peruse&#xD;
from a bookstand, fearing to sully its priceless pages;) and that&#xD;
too as coolly as if the emblazoned volume had been but a. penny&#xD;
copy of "Mother Goose ;" and I was forded by politeness to&#xD;
stand by and see the ruthless monster wet his thumb to turn over&#xD;
the leaves, and he tumbled and touzled them as though they had&#xD;
been waste paper. I did not annihilate him with a glance,' because&#xD;
I had not the power ; I onlysaid, blandly :&#xD;
"My friend, I esteem you, but if you were my grandmother I&#xD;
could not do such an irreverent action."&#xD;
He did not shrink away at my mild rebuke. le actually took&#xD;
himself off in a huff, and went out and reviled me -for meanness.&#xD;
Heaven be praised! I lost my friend, but I keep my book.&#xD;

CHAPTER FIFTH.&#xD;
OUR CHRIS.&#xD;
MRs. BLAIR had as she said, "a hundred and fifty things to&#xD;
do' before she-could go out on her begging expedition. There&#xD;
were the doughnuts- to fry, or "boil," as the Yankee housewives&#xD;
say ;.the raised biscuits to get into the oven, the apples and&#xD;
quinces to stew, and the youngster to dress. She finished him&#xD;
off, fed him, and then tied him into his high chair and gave him&#xD;
the chicken feet 'to play with, while she prepared the fowls for&#xD;
broiling, arl was just wiping her hands on 'the long roller-&#xD;
towel behind the wash-room door, preparatory to resting a min-&#xD;
ute, and'fondling her baby, when Christabel Goldsmith came fly-&#xD;
ing joyously in. She threw off her hood and dropped her cloak&#xD;
upon- the first chair, and catching up little Pigeon, chicken feet&#xD;
and all, she hugged and kissed him rapturously.&#xD;
" My little husband" 'said she, in the clear ringing voicd she&#xD;
rarely used now; "my precious pet ! you 'are to take care of me&#xD;
to-day, it seems, and we must keep the house without family jars.&#xD;
Oh, dear Ruth, this is so nice, I can stay all day. I've iny wrist-&#xD;
bands-in my pocket, only four to stitch, and I can read 'and talk,&#xD;
and even be idle if I like ; it is so pleasant to do 'that sometimes.'&#xD;
Mother was going to say 'no,' she had her teeth all set for it; I&#xD;
saw the 'no' in her eyes, 'but George stopped it with one of his&#xD;
grand persuasive looks, and turned it into, a slim 'yes'; and I&#xD;
hurried up the rest of the' towels and things I had to iron, and&#xD;
chopped the hash, and did up all the odds and ends mother could&#xD;
contrive, and she's good at contriving work, is mother-and here'&#xD;

Three years have gone by, and Christabel is fifteen. Let us&#xD;
note the changes. The dimpled beauty, of her childhood is all&#xD;
.gone ; she is tall, and as slender as a reed by the watercourse.&#xD;
Her large brown eyes are lighted just now with merry light, and&#xD;
her full lips arched into a sweet smile, but the smiles come too&#xD;
rarely, and there is often a wistful glance from under her long&#xD;
lashes, which is the sad fellow to a sigh. She stands erect enough,&#xD;
and with graceful gestures'tells her story,' but in any other pres-&#xD;
ence than this friend's whom  she safely trusts, she .is likely to&#xD;
be awkward and 'angular, and when she ceases to speak or listen&#xD;
she sinks away into distraint absence which sits oddly -upon so&#xD;
young a girl; and she is, apt to start abruptly iin painful alarm,&#xD;
when:suddenly addressed, as though expecting rebuke and harsh-&#xD;
ness, or maybe a blow.&#xD;
Ruth looked keenly at her eager face, so eloquent to express&#xD;
her joy, and she marked the deep purple circles beneath her lus-&#xD;
trous soft eyes, but she forebore- to ask the cause. Tears and&#xD;
Christabel had grown familiar acquaintances in the last three&#xD;
years. Her home-life was as sadly changed from its delightful&#xD;
fullness of varied occupation, as was she from the gay, happy,&#xD;
loving, and well-beloved child we knew in her dear'father's time.&#xD;
The practical Mrs. Goldsmith recognized, we know, but orie phase&#xD;
of existence,' and that was the work-a-day one, alternated it is'&#xD;
true by the Sabbath rest, if going to meeting three times, to Sun-&#xD;
day school twice, and eating cold bits in the pantry, with her&#xD;
shoes on her feet and her loins girded about, as the Israelites took&#xD;
their passover, and sitting grim and prim with her big Bible on&#xD;
her knees and the "Great Tribulation " atop of it, between 'whiles,&#xD;
could be called rest. The good dame was anxious and dissatisfied&#xD;
if she was not driving and pushing somebody, and poor-Chris had&#xD;
to bear the goad of her parent's thrift and business faculty as&#xD;
best she might. Every moment which she got to. herself she&#xD;
spent in eagerly poring over- her beloved books, in some out-of-&#xD;
the-way place, and the very secrecy she was forced to nse made&#xD;
the study seem almost like a crime. - Her beautiful curls were&#xD;
always knotted up anyhow,.or hanging untidy and frizzled over&#xD;

&#xD;
her shoulders; she no longer gave time or thought to her looks;,&#xD;
dress and,- personal adornment were not for her, all ornaments'&#xD;
were prohibited and sniffed at as sinful. -' This perishing body,&#xD;
soon to -be food for worms," it was part of her mother's religion&#xD;
to mortify and keep uider in her daughter.  Chris was very like&#xD;
to her father, and casual observers could not help noting the.un-&#xD;
canny looks which the widow gave her sometimes, especially.&#xD;
when she would) sit with hands folded on her lap, and the far-off&#xD;
wistful glance of her brown eyes, and the sorrowful curve of her&#xD;
scarlet lips recalled the dead too forcibly. It is not to, be sup-&#xD;
posed that one incident of the last day of Fred Goldsmith's life&#xD;
had ever, dropped ~out of the woman's memory, and ,poor Chris&#xD;
was often made sharply to feel the sting of her troublesome rec-&#xD;
ollections. Life had got reduced to very narrow limits for the,&#xD;
lonely child;' freedom from work and time to herself with quiet&#xD;
for reading was the highest form of happiness she sought. She&#xD;
never thought of looking in her mirror, adjusting a stray curl, or&#xD;
glancing over her shoulder and smiling at herself, as happy, care-&#xD;
less young girls are wont to do, who are on -confidential terms&#xD;
with their own image. In the morning she was accustomed to&#xD;
draw her book from under her pillow at day-dawn, and she read&#xD;
till forcedto- get out of bed by a call from her mother's strident&#xD;
voice. - She had learned to time the matron's motions, and kept&#xD;
her ear unconsciously strained to catch the sounds in her room&#xD;
below, and at the very last moment she sprang up and huddled&#xD;
on her clothes .as.rapidly as possible, and she gave them no more&#xD;
thought unless forced to do so by an unlucky tear' or rip, and&#xD;
then she pinned over the obtrusive aren't, and so.earned for herself,&#xD;
a torrent of hard words for her "shiftlessness."  She kept a book&#xD;
on her ironing-board, and read while she drew the hot iron over&#xD;
the damp clothes, carelessly, indifferently; and got frequent&#xD;
scoldings for scorched or wrinkled linen, and sometimes I am&#xD;
sorry to say that she got angry and retorted, saying that "such&#xD;
tasks were not fit for her father's daughter, and she despised.&#xD;
them."  Such bitter outbreaks were not frequent, however, and&#xD;
always earned their reward. the grim widow had put her rebel-&#xD;
&#xD;
lious child through many courses of bread and water and&#xD;
solitary stitching with much apparent relish, still she would read,&#xD;
she kept a volume in her, work-basket and stealthily perused it&#xD;
between the stitches. During the interminable "Notes and .Coni-&#xD;
ments,'-Scott, Henry, Barnes, and Bush, which the widow went&#xD;
droning through at the morning devotions, she coached herself in&#xD;
her Latin verbs and German declensions; but still was not so&#xD;
much hardened that the sweet hymns her papa loved did not melt&#xD;
her to tears.&#xD;
With the excellent grounding she had received from poor Fred,&#xD;
she had gone on crowding all sorts of knowledge into her .mind,&#xD;
without method or order. She gobbled it, but her wonderful&#xD;
memory, both ready and retentive, never failed her, and she was&#xD;
able,-to bring .forth things new and old from  her storehouse, at&#xD;
pleasure.&#xD;
With girls of her own age she was bashful and silent, in the&#xD;
rare times she got in contact with them, and could never think&#xD;
of much to say to them; - when she did essay to talk, they&#xD;
either gaped in open-mouthed astonishment,, or secretly derided&#xD;
her for a niddy. She would sit an'd listen in profound :wonder&#xD;
to hear them  joyously pour out their inanities by the hour,&#xD;
and embellish them with pretty laughter ; she watched their&#xD;
free motions in awkward embarrassment, marveling how they did&#xD;
it, and vainly.striving to find a proper attitude and arcomely place&#xD;
for her hands, and to hide her obtrusive, ill shod feet, which-&#xD;
would always protrude from the antiquated, formless garments&#xD;
which her mother's thrift economically saved up for her. :&#xD;
To-day she was free, gay, at ease, though sometimes the shadow&#xD;
of her home-life dropped upon her for a little, and she had to be&#xD;
roused as from a spell  Ruth Blair was. the' only friend 'she had&#xD;
made since her great bereavement. She had ,not, been a day&#xD;
at school in her life ; Mrs. Goldsmith told her with grinrelish,&#xD;
when she begged to be permitted to go,.that she "allowed;she'd&#xD;
.fooled away about time enough amongst trumpery books and "now&#xD;
she was goin' to be kep to something useful ;" and shewas "kep,"&#xD;

she being the while in a state of hard enjoyment of her only&#xD;
daughter's struggles under her iron rule.&#xD;
When in process of time Ruth Ashinead settled herself easily&#xD;
and comfortably in the chilly house, as though it had been the&#xD;
most enjoyable 'residence in the world, little Chris nestled up to&#xD;
her like a kitten to its mother. She shared her bed and her&#xD;
- thoughts with the young teacher, and the friendship was the one&#xD;
gay sunbeam which shone on her hopeless life. : Lively, talkative,&#xD;
and amusing, as well as helpful and efficient, Ruth gained without&#xD;
apparent effort an influence over the widow, which procured for'&#xD;
poor over-worked Chris some little relaxation, and brief snatches'&#xD;
of enjoyment. She helped her with her "stent," she looked over&#xD;
her drawings, directed. her studies, talked with her of her papa,&#xD;
and sang with her-these last mostly at odd times while the&#xD;
widow was abroad at female prayer-meetings and missionary so.&#xD;
cieties. A homeless orphan, an ardent book-lover, was Ruthie,&#xD;
and she quickly comprehended and fully* sympathised with Chris,&#xD;
and did her best to harmonize her oddities, and encourage her to&#xD;
battle with her painful .self conscious shyness, and when she got a&#xD;
giant of a husband and a cosy home of her own, she had always&#xD;
a warm welcome for the child, and revolved and executed many&#xD;
plans for her benefit and pleasure.&#xD;
Christabel stood with her little husband n her arms, thought-&#xD;
fully watching Ruth's dressing, with face of sweet content.&#xD;
"What a comical idea for you to go begging, Ruthie," said she.-&#xD;
" Do you suppose you will like it ?"&#xD;
"I don't imagine I shall-dote on it ; but if I succeed I shall be&#xD;
very glad. I should be gladder still if I could, as- Captain Slo-&#xD;
cum says, 'just put' my hand in my trousers and pull out the&#xD;
money.' ! But blacksmithing 'don't . permk lavish charities, even&#xD;
those which begin at home."&#xD;
Chris smiled ; she liked Ruth's nonsense, and took great pleas-&#xD;
ure in looking at her fresh face.&#xD;
"You will of course go to the Walsinghams, 'nd Bradshaws,&#xD;
and those. Mother disapproves of the Vedders, ('them Ved-&#xD;
derses,' she calls them,) because they are Lutherans; but I think&#xD;
&#xD;
they must be nice, they have such beautiful flowers. Will' you&#xD;
,,.&#xD;
go there ?"&#xD;
" No dear. I intend taking the bull by the horns, that is, the&#xD;
Gonecussets. I shall carry the war into Africa at once. I shall&#xD;
valiantly pull the bell and say, 'Mrs. Deacon Williams, will you&#xD;
contribute of your substance to alleviate the sufferings of human-&#xD;
ity ?' I shall indulge in plenty of big words, for they inspire her&#xD;
respect. She talks much about her various,= charities ; she has&#xD;
plenty of money, and much reputation for piety; I expect a great&#xD;
yield from my tillage in that quarter. You see I have faith like&#xD;
a grain of mustard-seed. She is the mother of many Grachis,&#xD;
and must have lots of old toga puerillises to dispose of; I shall&#xD;
virtuously permit her to be Lady Bountiful, and make me her&#xD;
almoner. I shall call next upon the minister's wife, the Rev.&#xD;
Mrs. Growing; she, in virtue of her position, must be ready-for&#xD;
every good work. I expect I shall have to call a truck to cart&#xD;
home all. the things, and- if they come before I do, 'please take&#xD;
them in, for I'm coming too. Good-bye,, dear Chris; take good&#xD;
care of the little 'husband. Perhaps I had better lock the book-&#xD;
case before I go, remembering your frailties; please don't cook&#xD;
the chicken by a book, as you did those sausages."&#xD;
"Don't tease, Ruthie," said Christabel, blushing up; '' let by-&#xD;
gones be' by-gones; I won't forget myself this time."&#xD;
"And look here, Chris dear," drawing the reluctant girl up&#xD;
before the mirror. " There's 'a brush and comb in this drawer,&#xD;
and here is a clean collar; you always let me remind you, and&#xD;
poke you up, you know ; and' we'll stitch and talk, and have a&#xD;
gay.time this evening; and Ill remember all the funny things I&#xD;

CHAPTER SIXTH.&#xD;
GOING B EGGING.&#xD;
THE storm was over, and the trees were clothed in sheen, and&#xD;
every long icicle twinkled and glistened in the sunshine, The&#xD;
frozen ground rung out crisp and clear under each foot-fall, and&#xD;
little Mistress Ruth walked briskly along, her round face cheerful&#xD;
and fullof.'busy hope, her red riding-hood as becoming as possi-&#xD;
ble, and her quilted cloak suggestive of absolute comfort. To be&#xD;
sure she noticed- the Siberian sables which Adeliza Euphemia&#xD;
Hitchcock displayed as they exchanged bows on the corner of&#xD;
Pinnacle Place, but she was too full of her errand to give them&#xD;
as much attention as they merited; she felt sure people must see&#xD;
the case as she did, tmd she would only have to mention the needs&#xD;
and sorrows of the poor creatures, and receive the warmest and&#xD;
readiest response to her appeal, and that they would so open&#xD;
their hearts and purses -that she would return laden with gifts.&#xD;
She' rang Mrs. Deacon Williams' door-bell with, a firm hand and&#xD;
a most. assured mien. -She was a modest little woman, too, not&#xD;
given to thrust herself forward.&#xD;
Deacon Williams was, as old Miss Pettengill observed, "a pil.,&#xD;
low" in the church. He was rich, enterprising, President of the&#xD;
Gonecusset Manufacturing Co., and felt himself to be quite the&#xD;
little great man of Millville, or at least his wife felt it for him.&#xD;
George Blair said "she ruled him not wisely but too well."  She&#xD;
was a stout, powerful woman, nearly a head taller than her lord ;&#xD;
what people call "personable" in appearance, and though she&#xD;
murdered the King's English, and afforded much mirth to the&#xD;
&#xD;
thoughtless young girls, who were fond of quoting her queer ren-&#xD;
derings of her mother tongue ; she had her say in the church&#xD;
and society, and was run after and felt her importance, and insist-&#xD;
ed that others should both feel and acknowledge it. Any project&#xD;
started. without consulting Mrs. Deacon Williams, was frowned&#xD;
down. and discouraged by her and her followers, and it would&#xD;
have argued much want of savoir faire in Mistress Ruth to have&#xD;
commenced her visits elsewhere than at the fine showy house&#xD;
on the corner of Gonecusset Street.&#xD;
A grim-faced girl opened the door about a hand-breadth, who&#xD;
scowled at the red riding-hood, and, answered inquiries as if&#xD;
Ruth's ring at the bell had been a personal affront.&#xD;
"I s'pose she's to whoam; I seen her on the top of the larder&#xD;
just now. Miss Williams ! here's a woman wanting of you."&#xD;
She pointed to the parlor door with her parboiled finger, and&#xD;
'tramped off flat-footed, growling about having to answer the&#xD;
bell, and "me wid the work of two gells and a -man to do," and&#xD;
disappeared, banging the door after her.&#xD;
Ruth, left to her own devices, finding Mrs. Williams -did not&#xD;
appear, pushed gently at the half-opened door, and entered the&#xD;
showy apartment, where she perceived the lady on the top of a&#xD;
step-ladder busily engaged in hanging some curtains of embroid-&#xD;
ered lace, which the Deacon had brought her as a peace-offering&#xD;
for a little matter in which he had attempted' to have his own&#xD;
way, and signally failed, and been forced to pay dearly for the&#xD;
audacious attempt besides.&#xD;
"Good morning, Miss Blair ;" she looked down as patronizingly&#xD;
as the precarious tenure of her dangerous elevation would permit.&#xD;
"I'm dreadful busy,.you see ; I ain't ashamed to be keen work-&#xD;
ing ; I couldn't trust this kind 'of a job to imy help. I'll be&#xD;
through in a minute, as soon as ever I've tacked up this cornish."&#xD;
Ruth followed the lady's motions in unconscious anxiety;,and&#xD;
thought peradventure she might come down before that, if she&#xD;
did not mind well the center of gravity, for the slender ladder&#xD;
tilted suspiciously under the weight of her stout person. But the&#xD;
last finishing touches to the upholstery were put, and the descent&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC7821-00000034"/>&#xD;
66         wInow GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
effected without accident from the sigltly pedestal, only a little&#xD;
unexpected development of fat calves and knit garters.&#xD;
"I declare I should want to be a statute if I was going to stop&#xD;
up there long. Dir. Scudder told us to the missionary meetin'&#xD;
last night,-about folks standing ever so many years  n the top-&#xD;
of a, pillar-',skylights' they call 'em. (Not very far for 'sty-&#xD;
lites.'). I shouldn't believe a word on't if he hadn't a been a&#xD;
minister. I don't see you'to Thursday night meetings much&#xD;
now; can't you make your husband take care of the baby ? ought&#xD;
to tend up to the means of grace--I always dp."&#xD;
Without waiting for a reply to her admonition she plunged into&#xD;
so many details of her domestic management, and her troubles&#xD;
with her- help, that it was not till she paused for breath that Ruth&#xD;
even triedto.edge in her little story; but she finally did it in a&#xD;
few chosen words, and drew a touching picture of the helpless,&#xD;
starving baby, and. her voice got tremulous and her eyes tearful&#xD;
before she finished.&#xD;
"Well now, du tell! I want to know ! If that ain't curous ;&#xD;
some- children will live through lots."&#xD;
" Not an article of clothing I assure you, Mrs. Williams ; and&#xD;
the rest as ragged and miserable as possible "&#xD;
" Unlucky ! I do declare-; I don't allow I've got a single rag&#xD;
left that I can anyways spare. I allers sell my old duds to the&#xD;
Jew peddlers.; .I get a good many nice pieces of chany that way ;&#xD;
it saves my husband considerable in the course of the year, our&#xD;
family is so dreadful caustic."&#xD;
" Perhaps-you might send them a little pork, or butter, or flour,&#xD;
or something edible; I give you my word that you can't send&#xD;
amiss."&#xD;
".There ain't no sense- in .beggars in this land of plenty," re-&#xD;
torted Mrs. Williams, ,with considerable sharpness, offended and&#xD;
astonished by the bold suggestion; "let folks work and earn their&#xD;
living , Isay, and not. hang on to other folks.  I object to encour-&#xD;
agin' such on principle. If I have anything to give away I aillers -&#xD;
send -it to the missionaries. I and the Deacon and all the children&#xD;
are life-members of most all the benevolent societies goin', and that&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGIITER.&#xD;
&#xD;
is nigh about all we can afford, besides what we have to give to&#xD;
keep the church agoin'. Old clothes don't count nothing, neither.;&#xD;
they just take and put 'em on and wear'em out, and come traipsing&#xD;
back after more. --Let 'em go to-the poor house if they can't take'&#xD;
care of themselves ; that's what we pay' our taxes for I s'pose."&#xD;
Poor little Ruth felt her hopes oozing out at her-fingers' 'ends,&#xD;
but she bravely essayed one more trial.&#xD;
"Couldn't you -go down and visit this family, Mrs. Williams ?&#xD;
The husband and father lost his life in the employ of the Gone.&#xD;
cusset Company, and pardon me if I say that I think they have&#xD;
claims upon it in consequence."&#xD;
She felt'her cheeks grow hot, and her voice vibrated upon Mrs.&#xD;
Williams' ears in a way that made her turn from her interesting&#xD;
occupation, (looping up her curtains over their scarlet cords,) and&#xD;
stare at, the little pleader in simple astonishment. She, also&#xD;
glanced 'at her own stoutness in her great mirror. Such audac-&#xD;
ity ! Though her sleeves were rolled up, and her portly figure&#xD;
was protected by a check apron, anybody could -see, with half an&#xD;
eye, that she was a leading person ; not' one of the genie descent,&#xD;
to be sure, but a " first-lady" in Millville&#xD;
There wassomething in the tone of Ruth's voice and her glow-'&#xD;
ing face which checked the coarse reply which rose to her lips ;&#xD;
besides this young blacksmith's wife was hand-and-glove with the&#xD;
Bradshaws, and Craigenfells, and the rest of the Roaring River&#xD;
set-those "indifferent apes," as the Deaconess sometimes wrath-&#xD;
fully called them-who rarely accepted invitations to her showy&#xD;
parties, and who passed. her by on the other side generally, and&#xD;
it would not do to display the cloven foot too visibly.&#xD;
How lucky it is that we cannot see into each other's thoughts!&#xD;
Little Ruthie' was much disturbed in the pause which followed&#xD;
her last shot, and in which 'the Deaconess turned her back upon&#xD;
her and dusted the center-table with her' apron, and pulled about&#xD;
the costly trifles upon it. 'Poor' silly'little Ruth began' to think&#xD;
how she should get out gracefully, and to be sorry that she had&#xD;
come in. The grandeur and the air of lavishness and abundance&#xD;
in this pretentious house oppressed' her, and made her own bed&#xD;

&#xD;
longings seem poor and mean by comparison. . In spite of, her&#xD;
excellent sense, her cultivation, and her sincere piety, she had&#xD;
her foibles, she longed for the flesh-pots, she loved handsome&#xD;
clothing and well-appointed surroundings; her tea tasted best out&#xD;
bf her grandmother's egg-shell china, and she smiled most at&#xD;
herself in her -one grey silk and delicate lace'ruffles. Very weak&#xD;
and foolish, of course, but Ruth Blair was far from "being perfect,&#xD;
and it' cost her a constant effort to keep her tastes? locked- in her-&#xD;
self, lest they should take the form of vain desires, and so seem a&#xD;
reproach to her noble husband's poverty. Besides, Mrs. Wil-&#xD;
liams' manner was very brusque and unpleasant, and she put on&#xD;
the stand-aside attitude which people well-to-do' in the world are&#xD;
apt to assume toward employees; and though Ruth saw through'&#xD;
her pretensions, and knew her own value, still their relative posi-&#xD;
tions made her uncomfortable ; she felt shabby in her red riding-&#xD;
hood, (the Deaconess's maroon velvet bonnet with bird of Para-&#xD;
dise plume, and her cloak to match, were hanging over a chair in&#xD;
the corner,) and she began to pluck nervously at 'her woollen&#xD;
gloves, and wish she was at home with Pigeon._&#xD;
Finding her awkward feelings getting the better of her, and&#xD;
that the first Gonecusset was near making her'cry, she rose with&#xD;
a hasty "good morning," but before she reached the door Mrs.&#xD;
Williams seemed struck-with a brilliant idea.&#xD;
" Hold on a minute, Miss Blair," said she ; " I've thought of a&#xD;
plan that will be as pat. as a pancake for them poor folks-just&#xD;
the chequer. You see I and Miss John Bisbee and Miss Square.&#xD;
Hitchcock are goin' to get up a sewin' society for benevolent pur-&#xD;
poses; sit down-not there-them 'ed satin chairs ain't fit 'to set'&#xD;
on, take this here one. We sent word to [iss Growing about it&#xD;
yesterday, and. she sent back that she would 'cheerfully coope-&#xD;
rate,' not that we expect any great shakes from her, but it looks&#xD;
proper for the minister's wife 'to seem prominent. We thought&#xD;
we'd make up a missionary bowx; old Miss Pettengill's sister, Se-&#xD;
nantha Pettengill, you know, married that Mr. Snuffer that come,&#xD;
home last year after his seventh wife, and they have gone out to&#xD;
labor amongst the Arabs or the Curds, I forget which'; 'tenarate&#xD;
&#xD;
she keeps, all the while writin' home, Semantha :does, for things;&#xD;
and Patience, that's old Miss Pettgngill, ydu know, has been&#xD;
hangin' on to me and the Deacon to have the church get up a&#xD;
box, and the contributions are all published in the ' Misionary&#xD;
Herald; but if you are a mind to take holt lively, and invite in&#xD;
the folks your side of the river, we might fix up them poor fam-&#xD;
ilies fast. I think myself that it would have a good look to get&#xD;
such a classintothe Sunday, school-what they call guttergsnipes,&#xD;
you know-put by themselves, of course they couldn't ,expect to&#xD;
mix in with the rich children; .I believe it would have a salutary&#xD;
effect. Don't you agree with me, Miss Blair? I think it would&#xD;
be a good plan for you to take the class, and I'll make Mr. Grow-&#xD;
ing teach them girls you've got. Zoe Walsingham and Sab 'iny&#xD;
ought to have a man teacher anyway, and these sort of children&#xD;
will stand knockin' and cuffin', and you used to be a scool-marm&#xD;
you know, and I'll allow you' can manage 'em first rate."&#xD;
Ruth smiled as-she sat down on the ottoman, and her self-poise&#xD;
adjusted itself during the Deaconess's speech.&#xD;
"I have long wished, Mrs. Williams, that there might be some-&#xD;
thing done for the factory children, they are getting so numerous&#xD;
and so unruly. Millville is quite a different place to what Roar-&#xD;
ing River used to be. It pains me to see the poor ragged chil-&#xD;
dren straggling about the fields, fighting, swearingall day Sun-&#xD;
day. We've a good many candidates for the prison growing up&#xD;
here I'm afraid, and I should be glad to assist any movement that&#xD;
promises benefit to the neglected young vagabonds."&#xD;
" Jes' so, Miss Blair, and I thought about sending Mike round&#xD;
to see if you wouldn't like to have the first meetin' to your house.&#xD;
I've been goin' to call upon. you ever since you got married. I&#xD;
think the Deacons' wives ought to call upon, everybody in the&#xD;
church, rich and poor, we are all one family, but.I'm so dreadful&#xD;
busy all the while. It won't be much expense, only a plaintea,&#xD;
one kind of cake, biscuits and dried beef or tongue, or some such&#xD;
thing; we are goin' tohave that drawed into the constitution. I&#xD;

such with a post-office, and tellin' their fortunes, and all-that.&#xD;
I'm proper glad you happened along just;as you did ; Miss Grow-&#xD;
ing hasn't got notove up in her front parlor, and I'm so conflict-&#xD;
ed with the tick-doloro that I don't never dast to say I'll -do&#xD;
nothing a day aforehand ; and Miss John Bisbee sent me word&#xD;
last-night that her Hiram was took down with the diabolical dis&#xD;
ease, so she can't have it, and you seem to be the one to begin.&#xD;
We've agreed to let-Mr. Growing read' the notice Sunday, and&#xD;
have the first meetin' next Thursday."&#xD;
Mrs. Blair hardly knew what to say to this arrangement which&#xD;
was all cut and dried and poked at her. George did not think&#xD;
highly of sewing societies, she had heard him say so; he gave,&#xD;
ludicrdus accounts of one where he got his trade, which set half&#xD;
the town by the' ears ; still she was rather pleased to be counted&#xD;
in, and her-"Horse Shoe" fixed upon for the first convocation ;&#xD;
and she inly smiled as, she was conscious of the emotion. Her&#xD;
associations-lay mostly among the old families around- the hills ;&#xD;
that they were not much nearer-was the fault of her own shrink-&#xD;
ing pride, and not their neglect. She had "boarded round " also&#xD;
among thesGonecussets, but they never seemed to think her worth&#xD;
cultivating, nothing but school-ma'am, and now lower still in the&#xD;
social scale, "married to one of our men."  Ruthie knew this,&#xD;
and foolishly resented it; but'still she liked their enterprise and&#xD;
bustle and mechanical skill; their 1'ng-headed forethought, their,&#xD;
capacity to conduct their large business ; she liked their success&#xD;
and its generous fruitage. They kept their"families handsomely,&#xD;
drove fine horses, they could come and go at pleasure without&#xD;
'counting the cost;- in short, as old Miss Pettengill said, they&#xD;
&#xD;
"acted rich," and Ruthie often found herself thinking how much&#xD;
such a generous life was to be prefei-red to her straightened econ-&#xD;
omy ; and she fully appreciated the force of Captain Slocum's&#xD;
remarkP: "Poverty ain't no disgrace, but .it's darned ' inconven-&#xD;
ient."&#xD;
Mrs. Ruth was somewhat flurried with ,the prospect of a tea-&#xD;
drinking, a thing she had never yet felt equal to; she had a con-&#xD;
sciousness that she could shine - in the position of hostess if she&#xD;
had but free scope for her efforts, aid really, the working out of&#xD;
the great principles of benevolence inspired -her with quite a little&#xD;
glow. She saw already, in her mind's eye, whole regiments Of&#xD;
lagged regulars clothed, their wants- supplied, their desperate&#xD;
needs turned into abundant plenty. And the first flowering of&#xD;
this plant of glorious promise was to be brought forward, forced&#xD;
as it were, in her Horse Shoe. Well, well! there was an eclat&#xD;
about that at any rate ; something worth' striving for. Putting&#xD;
away therefore all her dread of George's certain raillery or his&#xD;
possible displeasure, she assented to Mrs. Williams' proposal,&#xD;
set down her insolence to ignorance, 'and bade' her a- cheerful&#xD;
"good morning."&#xD;
As she turned from the highly ornamented iron gate,'-which&#xD;
clanged after her, she felt as if it were - hardly worth her 'while&#xD;
to solicit further aid 'for her proteges, for whom this well of con-&#xD;
solation was about to be opened, from which they were -to, draw&#xD;
comforts by the' buckets"full; still as several- days must elapse&#xD;
before the important Thursday, and she remembered the forlorn&#xD;
han.bone, 'guiltless of meat, which .she had seen boiling at the&#xD;
old school-house, she determined to pursue 'her' original intention&#xD;
so far as to call upon'the young pastor's wife.&#xD;
'As she walked along she thought of her noble-Giant, and went&#xD;
over to herself all the strong arguments she should be obliged to&#xD;
use to defend her project from his teasing raillery, and she smiled&#xD;
at the fancied '"Jove" she heard him utter under breathewhen&#xD;
she told .him. "' Still," said she,' aloud, "'I -know George is-too&#xD;
good' a husband to show up his wife, even = if he does not thor-&#xD;
oughly approve, making it evident that I amii not mistress of :my&#xD;

actions ; and though he may tease me unmercifully, I know he&#xD;
will end in helping me out."&#xD;
Thus far they had floated their life-boat on a smooth and pleas-&#xD;
ant current; they had yet to try the dangerous rocks of ambition,&#xD;
self-will, and hidden passions.&#xD;
The expense of the-undertaking appalled her, and she was&#xD;
silly enough also to feel dismayed by the unfurnished state of her&#xD;
parlor, =which she rarely used in winter ; but her self-respect soon&#xD;
got the better of that, and she took trouble. to explain to herself&#xD;
that "of course it is not like giving a party ; the ladies will' be&#xD;
too full of good works to criticise my furniture ;" and she really&#xD;
enjoyed in anticipation her little triumph in the way of biscuits&#xD;
as white as snow.&#xD;
"I'll take goodcare that Jerusha Judkins does not get into my&#xD;
pantry. I think she's 'first cousin' to Alvira Slimins; I wonder if&#xD;
it isn't brimstone which makes those old maid milliners so spiteful."&#xD;
While she was running over in her mind the recipe for crullers&#xD;
which Grandma Walsingham gave her, and making a mental cal-&#xD;
culation of the nullber which would be needed, she was ushered&#xD;
into the presence of the Reverend Mrs. Growing.-&#xD;
The parsonage nursery was in a wing, and the seven-sided bay&#xD;
window overlooked the hollow, which was laid' out and fancifully&#xD;
planted, and there sat the minister's wife with her five young&#xD;
children around her, a child's wagon in the center of the room,&#xD;
and playthings scattered in all directions: revolving steamboats,&#xD;
dancing-jaclks, trains of cars, vaulting dolls, barking dogs, and&#xD;
crying babies, all in: full blast ; and the emotionless mother look-&#xD;
ing helplessly on amid.the wreck of matter. She had light eyes,&#xD;
light hair, and a whity brown complexion, a. kind of washed out&#xD;
appearance, and an air of quiescent selfishness which made the&#xD;
charity-seeker feel at once-that she was come on a bootless errand,&#xD;
and it required allthe pluck Mistress Ruth could muster to ena-&#xD;
ble.her to-broach the subject.&#xD;
At the first breath of appeal she noted an, unspeakable gather-&#xD;
ing of herself together in the minister's wife, and her eyes really&#xD;
got fishy, so-'vacant were they of interest in the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;

" I'm very sorry for them, I'm .sure ; but I don't call to mind&#xD;
anything that I can spare. Mr. Growing's salary is so small we&#xD;
have to economize very closely. Joey, don't take the hammer to&#xD;
that steamboat ! there it goes, all to pieces, and I paid five dollars&#xD;
for it only Christmas-naughty boy !"&#xD;
Mrs.~ Growing had a fine property of her own, and it was whis-&#xD;
pered, and in fact pretty generally believed, that this attraction&#xD;
was the main one which the struggling young minister had seen&#xD;
in her, and which' proved strong enough to induce him to make&#xD;
her Mrs. Growing. If so, he must have. bitterly bewailed his&#xD;
folly,&#xD;
"I will look about, Mrs. Blair, and if I find anything I will&#xD;
send it around to you.. How is your dear baby? Family all&#xD;
well ?"&#xD;
"Quite, thank you.   These poor souls are in -desperate&#xD;
need; the smallest help in food or clothing will be heavenly&#xD;
charity ; in fact, I don't see how they are to live without&#xD;
help."&#xD;
"Yes-ahem-I dare say, but I usually make it a principle to&#xD;
bestow my-mite within the bounds of our own congregation ; be-&#xD;
sides there are sisters of charity in all our cities who make it a&#xD;
business to look after their own poor, and I should recommend&#xD;
that they immediately remove where they cani be legitimately&#xD;
cared for. I have a horror of those papists pouring in upon us;&#xD;
I am afraid we shall suffer in our morals as a community ; they&#xD;
are wretched, ignorant creatures, and so debased I really tremble&#xD;
for our village," and the excellent shepherdess performed a virtu-&#xD;
ous shudder over the thought.&#xD;
Little Ernest Growing had been standing by his mother's&#xD;
chair, an interested listener to the talk, and he turned his wistful&#xD;
blue eyes, full of.tears, to her face, and said:&#xD;
"' Mama, don't you think those poor children are some of the&#xD;
'little ones' papa read about this morning-Christ's little lambs ?&#xD;
How I should like to give them something. You know grand-&#xD;
mother has sent me a new beaver; can't I send my old 'cap? it&#xD;
isn't so very old, and I should like to feel that it was keeping that&#xD;

poor boy warnr. - Oh dear'! -oh dear ! how cold his poor feet must&#xD;
have been out in 'the snow all bare naked; and they bled, too.&#xD;
Mama, we must go at once and carry them plenty of things."&#xD;
There was a tingling of shame as well as anger in Mrs. Grow-&#xD;
ing's cheek as she rose hurriedly and -pushed Ernest ' away from&#xD;
her; 'she snatched a spool from number 'three with a little shake,&#xD;
and ordered him to "be quiet, and not ,drive her frantic with his&#xD;
noise."  She glanced sidewise at Mrs. Blair, and caught her look-&#xD;
ing at Ernest, '(who leaned against the rocking-chair,:'weeping&#xD;
silently,) ready'to cry'herself, and 'longing to take the gentle little&#xD;
fellow up in her arms and comfort him.&#xD;
"There, there, Ernest, 'don't 'be silly," said 'Mrs. Growing.&#xD;
'"I'll look around when I have time ; I dare -say I can find soine-&#xD;
thing, though of course he's a low, vicious child, a thief very&#xD;
likely.&#xD;
"'We'll send'the cap and I'thik the coat too," said 'Ernest, 'in&#xD;
a soft, decided. voice.'&#xD;
Mrs. Growing thought best not to hear her son's reply, and&#xD;
smiled blandly upon Ruth: "You will join the German class;&#xD;
Mr. "Growing quite counts upon "George,' as 'he calls your 'hus-&#xD;

flowing 'her to the door she added: ""My boy is so tender"heart-&#xD;

tho ,e plaid ones, I never could abide them. What a world this&#xD;
is, to be sure, and the best of the joke is that Ruth Blair is a&#xD;
part of it, a very small part, more's the pity. If I were but rich&#xD;
now, I would surely be very good."  Then she laughed as she&#xD;
repeated to herself, "Is thy servant a dog that he should do this&#xD;
thing ?" -&#xD;
She was still in full enjoyment of this sarcastic fling at her&#xD;
goodness, when she felt a light touch upon her shoulder. She&#xD;
had been speeding swiftly along, with her eyes upon the ground,&#xD;
and she stopped short, startled out of her reflections, and redden-&#xD;
ing angrily. She met the friendly glance of a., pair of grave,&#xD;
black eyes looking down upon her, and her face put on a most&#xD;
cordial welcome, and she thrust out both. her chubby hands, which&#xD;
were taken possession of immediately.&#xD;
" Why, Otho Groenveldt ! It is, is it not'?"&#xD;
"To the best of my belief it is, Ruthie-Mrs. Blair, I suppose&#xD;

at the Craigenfells, her face steeped in an aromatic decoction&#xD;
which maketh the noses of all who smell it- to tingle ; carefully&#xD;
watched. and attended by Deborah, who has evidently been long-&#xD;
ing for a child to coddle, and looks as happy over her nursing as&#xD;
a boy with his first love. Eh, Ruthie ?"  (His odd smile made&#xD;
Ruth turn away her face, though she could not free her hands.)&#xD;
" We arrived late last evening, and Bertha dispatched me with&#xD;
orders to find you and bring you face to face ;:she is all amiable&#xD;
impatience to renew her tendresse for her little teacher. He should&#xD;
be a rare fellow, Ruthie. who stole you away from us.. We missed&#xD;
you more than you would believe ; the Prof. is still in love with&#xD;
die kleine fraulein, and all my foreign travel, and the countless&#xD;
Dutch beauties I have seen have not blotted out the memory o&#xD;
the past you wot of."&#xD;
"The dear Proff.!" said Ruth, ignoring the latter part of his&#xD;
speech; "how I should like to go snailing with him once again.&#xD;
But Otho, do you know I am so happy ! I can't believe I was&#xD;
ever the homeless girl who floated about the. world unclaimed.&#xD;
Life is real and earnest to me now,". she added; her eyes full of'&#xD;
honest brightness.  You must see my husband, and my baby,&#xD;
Otho."&#xD;
"Indeed, Ruthie, have you also arrived at a baby ?"&#xD;
"cOh yes,.and, you will say I have good right to be proud of&#xD;
him, such. a noble fellow ! Of course you will come home with&#xD;
me and dine ?  George should be there by this time."{&#xD;
While she -gave. the invitation .she threw a furtive thought&#xD;
amongst her household goods, and the dinner she had left in prep-&#xD;
aration, and fervently hoped' that Chris would prove equal to her&#xD;
times.-&#xD;
"=With pleasure, Ruthie; I am sure you are a merry, thrifty,&#xD;
busy little housekeeper. I remember your cocoanut'pies and&#xD;
those marvelous peach shortcakes you fabricated in vacation time,&#xD;
when we had ' Rose-in-Bloom' all to ourselves, and I shall be-&#xD;
glad to know your husband. Is he a better man than , Ruthie ?"&#xD;
straightening himself, and glancing down upon her in a kind of&#xD;
malicious pride.&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
"Don't talk nonsense, Otho!" replied Mrs. Blair, snatching&#xD;
away her -hands, coloring violently, and turning aside her&#xD;
head with a conscious petulant air which well became her. "I&#xD;
thought you had 'grown wiser."&#xD;
"-The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learn-&#xD;
ing to his lips," said Mr, Groenveldt, keeping close by Ruth's side,&#xD;
who walked quickly on without speaking.&#xD;
He was a tall, slender, dark man, young, not much more than&#xD;
twenty, but so wanting in youthful jollity of manner as to seem&#xD;
much older. A cool, quiet, dignified' reserve marked his inter-&#xD;
coutse with his fellows, and much less of tenderness of tone than&#xD;
he had been using just now. The latent fire which slept in his&#xD;
black eyes sparkled out unexpectedly sometimes. Accustomed&#xD;
to weigh himself in a mental balance of his own adjusting, and&#xD;
to take his own way without opposition; a good lover he was,&#xD;
and a good hater. Strangers and outsiders passed him by with-&#xD;
out striking any fire out of him; but his few friends loved him&#xD;
passing well.&#xD;
The dinner was 'ready cooked when they reached the "MHorse&#xD;
Shoe."&#xD;
"Ruth, why dd you call this dear pretty little 'cottage' the&#xD;
'Horse Shoe?"' said Chris, one day.&#xD;
" For the same reason that the friars wore hair-cloth, to mortify&#xD;
the flesh," replied Ruth, laughing, and laughing still more at&#xD;
Chris's puzzled face.&#xD;
' The stalwart husband was already arrived, and sat before the&#xD;
glowing fire with Pigeon in his arms, and in a great frolic. The&#xD;
delighted youngster's fat little hands were buried among his fath-&#xD;
er's crisp curls, which he was doing, his best to pull out by the&#xD;
roots, and he was sending forth that gurgling chuckle which be-&#xD;
longs to well-nursed babyhood in a choice bit of mischief, and at&#xD;
every duck and' dive of the massive head he nearly went wild&#xD;
with delight.&#xD;
Ruth glanced at her husband with fond pride as she presented&#xD;
him to her old friend, but withal a trifle anxiously, she wished so&#xD;
much that he should appear to advantage ; and she smiled and&#xD;

her:brow cleared when he rose, something disheveled, but with&#xD;
grand hospitable simplicity, cordially offered his hand to the guest.&#xD;
Each took the-measure of the other on the instant, and the result&#xD;
seemed mutual satisfaction. They shook hands heartily like old&#xD;
friends, and stood conversing before the cheerful fire, while Ruth&#xD;
tool Pigeon in her arms and devoured him' with kisses; her&#xD;
cheeks were flushed and her eyes humid with emotion, which she'&#xD;
strove to conceal or subdue by her caresses. Whatever the feel-&#xD;
ing was, she battled with it and forced it out of sight, and was at&#xD;
once the gay, cheerful, busy little woman her household duties&#xD;
always made her.&#xD;
Christabel Goldsmith was seated in a corner before the wifidow,&#xD;
buried soul-deep in Geoffrey Hamlin's entrancing "Recollections."&#xD;
She never moved nor spoke when Ruth and Otho entered, nor&#xD;
heard anything going on in the room. Though faithful to her&#xD;
housekeeping charge and baby-tending, as soon as the responsi-&#xD;
bility was taken off by George's coming, she sank away into iso-&#xD;
lated forgetfulness. With the most absolute intention to act upon&#xD;
Ruth's hint about her'tangled mat of uncared-for curls, she had&#xD;
entirely failed to do so. The book lay ready to her hand, arid it&#xD;
was only by a brave effort that she refrained from reading till&#xD;
Mr. Blair came home, and took his baby in his arms and began&#xD;
tossing him up to the ceiling. Then she seized the volume ea-&#xD;
gerly, dropped into a seat and forgot everything about her.&#xD;
As if in a trance she sat within the " Golden Vineyaid,'' on&#xD;
the delicious veranda, looking out between the tangled passion-&#xD;
flowers, geraniums, and magnolias. She smiled at the magpie&#xD;
who cape furtively out of the house with the key in his mouth,&#xD;
and the cockatoo who entered waddling comfortably, and talking&#xD;
to himself. She laughed heartily at the wicked kitten who am-&#xD;
bushed around the corner, and upset her mother, knocking her&#xD;
over, and severely maltreating her-; and the jackdaw who dug&#xD;
up the doctor's choice bulbs with fearful od4hs, considering the&#xD;
burying of the same, at which he had slyly assisted, as a feat en-&#xD;
tirelyjn his own line; the kangaroo rats, the puppies, the collies,&#xD;
the bushman, were all real and living around her. Hundreds of&#xD;

&#xD;
gay paroquets flashed- their rainbow plumage in the white gum-&#xD;
trees, and the tame kangaroos sat like dogs at her feet. The dis-&#xD;
tant yell of the rough convicts driving their cape cattle, sounded&#xD;
in her ears; the soft air lapt ands folded her about as her wrapt&#xD;
soul surrendered. itself to the entrancing vision in the keenest&#xD;
enjoyment. It is certainly one of the most charming books ever&#xD;
written, and it is no wonder that our Chris lost herself amidst its&#xD;
delights.&#xD;
Ruth was tying Pigeon into his high chair, preparatory to set-&#xD;
ting on the dinner, and George came and slyly twitched her.sleeve&#xD;
and pointed out the young reader, with an odd grimace of whim-&#xD;
sical drollery.&#xD;
"You might fire off a cannon in this very room and she&#xD;
wouldn't hear it. In all the-deuce that Pigeon and I have raised&#xD;
she hasn't stirred a peg," he whispered.&#xD;
She sat with- both feet drawn up on the round of the high&#xD;
chair, her elbows resting on her knees, and her face in her hands,&#xD;
of which she had made a scoop, her extended forefingersstopping&#xD;
her ears, and her two long middle ones meeting over her eyes,&#xD;
and her thumbs beneath her chin. Thus she habitually shut out&#xD;
the world from her consciousness when she retired into a favorite&#xD;
volume.&#xD;
Three or four buttons were off her dress, which gaped un'tidily,&#xD;
refusing to be brought together by the pin she had borrowed&#xD;
from her collar-for that purpose; and that finishing article of&#xD;
toilette, cut loose. from responsibility, had fallen off and disap-&#xD;
peared in parts unknown. Her fruzzled hair, dressed a la frantic&#xD;
by Pigeon's manipulations, was ornamented here and. there by&#xD;
bits of down she had .acquired burrowing with him among the&#xD;
pillows ; two or three stray tresses fell over her shoulders, demon-&#xD;
strating how beautiful they could be in color and texture if the&#xD;
owner would= make much of them. Her little white teeth showed&#xD;
between her red lips, parted in a smile at the story she was rev-&#xD;
eling in. But withal the slender figure looked forsaken and neg-&#xD;
lected ; her dress of dark plaids stuff was too short in the sleeves,&#xD;
too scanty in the skirt. Mrs. Goldsmith's economy would not&#xD;

permit her to cast'aside any garment which could be pieced down&#xD;
or otherwise made available; and her prim, narrow ideas discour-&#xD;
aged from principle (she said, and she snuffed when she said it,&#xD;
and snapped her eyes,) all love of "silly dressing up" in her&#xD;
daughter. A pair of rusty, ragged shoes, worn down into wrin-&#xD;
kles at the heel, and tied with coarse leather strings, covered her&#xD;
slender feet. (Ah, where were the dainty slippers and Polish&#xD;
boots edged with sable which her fond papa had loved to see~her&#xD;
in ?)&#xD;
" Poor dear" said Ruth, sighing ; " she has a pitiful life of it.&#xD;
Her mother is such an uncharitable grinder, she makes m~y heart&#xD;
ache every time I see her ; I wish I. could help her. Dods she&#xD;
not look as if reading against time, gathered up for a spring .any&#xD;
instant. It really seems a pity to break in upon her; these mo-&#xD;
inents are the happiest ones she knows. I must, though, for she&#xD;
shall smooth herself a little for dinner--and Bertha is so nice.'&#xD;
What do you suppose Otho will think of her ? too bad,.isn't it ?&#xD;
Christabel, dear," going softly up to 'her; "in what fairy-land&#xD;
are you wandering.?"&#xD;
Chris threw down. the volume, started swiftly to her feet, and,&#xD;
stood with her hands nervously clasped together reddening up to&#xD;
her temples.&#xD;
Ruth smiled at her, and pointed playfully to the discarded book.&#xD;
She answered with a smile bright and sweet, but still half asham-&#xD;
ed of her abstraction:,&#xD;
"IHow' you frightened me, Ruth," she said hurriedly. "I&#xD;
thought it was mother. = I had gotten everything ready, you 'see ;&#xD;
I never once looked into Geoffrey's story till George took Pigeon,&#xD;
and I had nothing else to fill up the minutes, you know, and it&#xD;
lay on the staid all the while, coaxing me, too. Mother says it's&#xD;
wicked to be idle ; Satan' gets after idlers."&#xD;
"You forgot this, love, said Ruth in a whisper, lifting one of&#xD;
the stray curls.,&#xD;
"Oh well, that does 'not-matter," she answered, jerking her&#xD;
head aside'; "I could, not bear to' waste a precious moment on&#xD;
that, an&amp;amp;to tell true,,I forgot all about it ; but nobody minds how&#xD;

"I mind, darling," said Ruth, tenderly kissing her flushed&#xD;
cheek; a feat.which she accomplished by standing on tip-toe.&#xD;
" Three can play at that game," said George, thrusting his head&#xD;
over the other shoulder ; "and a very nice game it is."&#xD;
She faced about upon him with flashing eyes; and gave his&#xD;
curly head a smart push, "Grosse tete et peu de sens," said she.&#xD;
"Garde bien!1" and as he still looked full of daring mischief, she&#xD;
.raised her hand to her burning cheek and stepped quickly aside.&#xD;
"Blue stocking ! blue stocking !" said George, with a teasing,&#xD;
mocking laugh.&#xD;
"Can it be possible, Mr. Blair," said she, with a quick change&#xD;
from sauciness to anger, " that you mean to remind me?"  She&#xD;
glanced down at the white footing which her blue mixed stockings&#xD;
had received. " Very well, laugh away."     ._    -&#xD;
Before she had time to listen to' George's protestations, she en-&#xD;
countered the gaze of a tall young stranger fixed upon her in&#xD;
grave inquiring wondelt  The vexing laugh died on her ears, and'&#xD;
she forgot her anger beneath the scrutiny of his thoughtful, ear-&#xD;
nest eyes. - She-stood with dilated nostrils, 'like some scared wild&#xD;
creature.brought to bay in the forest by a power never felt be-&#xD;
fore, and her soul looked out at her great brown eyes with timid&#xD;
longing and startled dread. It was as if she were trying to gaze&#xD;
into her future and read.her fate. Her bosom heaved, and tears&#xD;
welled up in her eyes and brimmed over. It was but an instant,&#xD;
and his firm, haughty mouth broke into a half-pitying, tender&#xD;
smile, and he turned away. She sighed and flushed painfully,&#xD;
even her hands blushed as she put them up to her tangled curls,&#xD;
and she shuffled her ill-shod feet, unconsciously seeking to hide&#xD;
their' clumsiness, and with restless haste she tried to slide away&#xD;
from th e all; but Ruth's arm thrown around her waist arrested&#xD;
her progress, and her loving voice reassured her.&#xD;
"No, Chris dear," said she, softly'; "you shall not run away;&#xD;
we are all ready now to eat the nice dinner you have  prepared.&#xD;
I have looked at the chicken, it is dune to a turn, and liei'eris my&#xD;
old friend Otho Groenveldt, who will sit at our frugali bod, ad&#xD;

&#xD;
from Germany and saur-kraut, and a bit of real genuine home-&#xD;
hsta will be a luxury."&#xD;
Chris bowed in a shy, awkward way, without lifting her eyes,&#xD;
ard edged off to her favorite corner, behind the work-stand.&#xD;
They considerately left her to herself, while they conversed&#xD;
pleasantly together. Otho Groenveldt sat down where he could&#xD;
study Chris without seeming to observe her.  He was puz..&#xD;
zled; this was a new phase of feminity. Was she a Cinderella&#xD;
without a god-mother ? The wistful, pleading look her eyes had&#xD;
given him, followed him in all his talk with George, and he caught&#xD;
himself between his replies trying to account for the tears. IHe&#xD;
saw without looking that she had sunk into a chair in a half&#xD;
crouching posture, and was absently studying the pattern of' the&#xD;
carpet.&#xD;
Mistress Ruth, flitting hither and thither, setting on the sa-&#xD;
vory chicken, dishing up the limas, bringing out a pile of fresh&#xD;
doughnuts, and a, pot of what she called coffeette, viz., breakfast&#xD;
coffee boiled over for dinner, came around after a while to Chris:&#xD;
in her corner, and said with quiet matter-of-fact face:&#xD;
"You did beautifully, dear."&#xD;
"I think," answered Chris, half unconsciously, "tIat is a mis-&#xD;
application; deeds may be glorious, wonderful, meritorious, but&#xD;
scarcely beautiful."&#xD;
"Wake up,. Chris !" said Ruth, laughing, and shaking her.&#xD;
"Everything is perfect, at all events, and after all, nothing is&#xD;
nicer ina friend than availability, and to'get up a good dinner is&#xD;
the surest way to win a heart; so Fanny Fern says, you know,&#xD;
though I doubt if she is much of a cook. I intend to found a&#xD;
college when George makes his rotary work, to be called the&#xD;
'Blair University,' where young ladies shall receive degrees ; I'll&#xD;
bestow on you a golden medal, dear. Now run, up and give your&#xD;
pretty hair one little smooth, and slip on a clean apron; you will'&#xD;
find some in the top drawer-and hurry down, there's a love"&#xD;
Chris threw a shy look across at the two gentlemen. " Must I&#xD;
come Ruth ? I'm such a-, bas bleu,' she finished, thrusting' out&#xD;
her foot scornfully.&#xD;
&#xD;

Chris smiled with trembling lip, and allowed herself to be&#xD;
Spushed through the door, which luckily was close at her&#xD;
side  But on looking into the mirror a heavier cloud dropped&#xD;
down over her face. It was such a shabby, unsightly figure which&#xD;
met her eyes; never before had she felt so much dissatisfied with&#xD;
herself, and ashamed of her untidiness. She lugged her dress&#xD;
together, and tried'to fasten it firmly, but it would burst open:and&#xD;
leave glaring gaps between the pins; her wrists showed bare and&#xD;
poking out of her scanty sleeves, and the short waist up under.&#xD;
her arms dragged across her bust, and looked narrow" and form-&#xD;
less. "And my holiday is spoiled,". she said impatiently, "and&#xD;
mecyony nos  he Ishall get another."  But she could not&#xD;
pas;Ruth wold wait for her, and besides she could never&#xD;
summon courage to face 'that stranger again if she stopped to&#xD;
think about it.&#xD;
"I don't suppose he has given himself the trouble to think of&#xD;
me," she went on, while smoothing her hair and knotting it up&#xD;
afresh ; but still when she came sidling in, she was intensely con-&#xD;
scious of her hands and feet, and colored to her ear-tips as she&#xD;
dropped into the place which Ruth pointed out, and which brought&#xD;
her opposite to the quietly questioning eyes which studied curie&#xD;
ously her downcast countenance.&#xD;
Artist life in Europe! A subject made familiar by charming&#xD;
tales of her dear papa's youth, so pleasantly told when they used&#xD;
to sit in the cosy library, or were fishing in the.beck. They took&#xD;
her back again over the graves of the dead years which had&#xD;
crept away into silence since that happy time, and somehow made&#xD;
her feel as she used then-quietly poised, sufficient to herself, and&#xD;
before she knew it, she was laughing softly, and had already spo-&#xD;
ken twice o' thrice. in a connected, graceful manner; with well-&#xD;
chosen words, and ringing,' tuneful voice, which caused George&#xD;
and Ruth to exchange pleased: glances, while they led her on;&#xD;

- and Otho Groenveldt drew her out with 'quiet tact an:p  ful'&#xD;
humor underlying his native gravity.     ;.&#xD;
When they got to inince pie, George said, with a, uish look:&#xD;
" By the way, Ruth, you haven't told us the result of your beg-&#xD;
ging expedition."&#xD;
Ruth laughed and looked foolish.&#xD;
"Well,:I did not have to order a truck to fetch. home the pro-&#xD;
ceeds, but I did find some effort afoot which I think will help us,&#xD;
out."&#xD;
"Indeed ! a subscription paper headed' by "-he was about- to.&#xD;
say'Dame Goldsmith, but stopped in time, and substituted-" Mrs.&#xD;
Deacon Williams."&#xD;
"No sir, nothing of the sort; we are to have a sewing society,"&#xD;
and: hurryingon-"before he had time to cut in with the railery she&#xD;
expected, " we are to have the first meeting here next Thursday."&#xD;
" Oh ny prophetic father," said George, under his breath ; "I&#xD;
shall pack up my kit on Wednesday, and be ~off for parts un-&#xD;
knowni."&#xD;
"No you will not, George; you will be kind and help me out&#xD;
of it... Now is the time for you to prove to Millville how good a&#xD;
husband you can be."&#xD;
She then detailed her morning's experience, exerting herself to&#xD;
miake it amusing,.feeling all the while an under-current of anxiety&#xD;
lest George should say ;something. in Otho Groenveldt's presence&#xD;
which should sound hasty, or as if he did not, endorse her pro-&#xD;
ceedings; and he did come near blurting out his disapprobation,&#xD;
but seeing how fully she was enlisted .in the effort, he repressed&#xD;
his desire to ridicule and condemn the whole thing;' only he said,&#xD;
ruefully:&#xD;
4 We masculines will have to catch it, eh, Groenveldt ? My&#xD;
ears begin to tingle already. Dame Williams will deliver some,&#xD;
of her lectures to young wives, on the management of ;their hus-&#xD;
bands, teaching how to abridge our comforts and increaseour&#xD;
tsefdilness."_&#xD;
"Oh; what a dear'silly old giant you are George! Isn't he,&#xD;
Pigeon?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Pretty papa," said Pigeon, patting"the vast shoulder with his&#xD;
tiny palm. "Pigeon loves papa," with such a bland air of sub-&#xD;
lime patronage as'to raise'a laugh at George's expense, and'cause&#xD;
a diversion in Ruth's favor.&#xD;
"You will let us husbands in to supper after you have talked&#xD;
us up sufficiently, I suppose."&#xD;
. "Of course; there has been nothing said to me about it. Mrs.&#xD;
Williams mentioned her intention of inviting the young men for&#xD;
the 'evenin's along,' but you know I could not consent to be a&#xD;
party to any arrangement which would leave my lord and master&#xD;
out in the cold."&#xD;
" Bravo ! loyal little wife. Make a note ori't, Groenveldt."&#xD;
"There is one thing I feel quite certain about," said Ruth, a&#xD;
little tartly; "if I had Mrs. Williams's money I would buy fewer&#xD;
laces and ribbons, and give away a trifle now and then, just for&#xD;
the sensation which a virtuous action leaves behind it."&#xD;
" Ruthie, Ruthie," said George, looking sober ; " I am afraid&#xD;
there's a little grain of bitterness underlying that speech. ' You&#xD;
haven't any mechlin laces, and you think your plump little shoul-&#xD;
ders are fair enough to display what is thrown away upon her&#xD;
elderly stoutness; and so they are, darling. Just wait a bit;&#xD;
my rotary is very near working now, and we'll try if we can't&#xD;
pump up a few knick-knacks - for- the blacksmith's wife ; only be&#xD;
sure that you don't begin to push by Miss Craddoc. ' Ruth does&#xD;
not admire~ the anvil chorus, Groenveldt ; she puckers up her&#xD;
mouth when she finds cinders among my hair. She's a natural&#xD;
born fine lady, is my Ruthie."&#xD;
" For shame, {George'!" spoke up Ruth quickly, and getting&#xD;
very red. " Do you suppose I would exchange places with any-&#xD;
body ?  Do me the justice to understand that I would' rather&#xD;
bide by my husband, the journeyman blacksmith, with my baby&#xD;
in my arms, than to take the highest place the: world could offer&#xD;
me."&#xD;
While she talked she looked straight'into Otho"Groenveldt's&#xD;
eyes, as if she were defying him;"and putting her hand upon&#xD;
George's arm, she added, excitedly;&#xD;

cDo you believe me, George ?"&#xD;
"Of course, Ruthie," replied he, laughing. "Why what a grand&#xD;
little tragedy queen it isI Upon my word, duck, you are nervous.&#xD;
You are trembling; over-walked'to-day, I know; and that young-&#xD;
ster is a drag on you.. We will have a nurse for the daughter, if&#xD;
the rotary works. You didn't suppose I meant blame, did you,&#xD;
dearest, (studying her changing face,) indeed I was only in fun."&#xD;
"I confess I should like money to give away. I could use it if&#xD;
I had it in a thousand pleasant things;, but I am not envious. I&#xD;
do not covet fine clothes."  She said this as if forcing herself to&#xD;
speak.&#xD;
George gazed at her an instant with a disturbed, troubled'ex-&#xD;
pression on his massive, honest face, and then burst into a laugh.&#xD;
"The thing for us at present, my dear, is to regard riches as a&#xD;
snare. It was the first pretty woman in the world, you remem-&#xD;
ber, who was first tempted. - I dare say you think now that if you&#xD;
had been there among the roses and the posies you would not have&#xD;
touched the apple."&#xD;
Ruth looking at her husband seemed to draw strength and rest&#xD;
from him, so stable and good, and her face settled as she smiled,&#xD;
and replied easily:&#xD;
"There have been a great number of wise things uttered on&#xD;
that apple business ; now since you mention it, I will jpst give&#xD;
you the. benefit of my thoughts upon it."&#xD;
" Certainly, duck; air your little opinions-what's to hinder ?"&#xD;
"Ithink Adam was probably. standing -under the tree, looking&#xD;
up at the luscious red apples, and wishing he only dare eat one,&#xD;
when Eve came along with her arms full:of tube-roses with which&#xD;
she. was going to dress the bower.&#xD;
'Eve, said-Adam, 'pointing up, 'see those apples ; how nice&#xD;
they look, don't. they ? I wonder if they are juicy? don't ,seem&#xD;
as if they would, poison anybody, does it? What if you should&#xD;
try one?'&#xD;
Eve,.who was all obligingness and polite' submission to-her&#xD;
lord, just reached up her pretty little hand without a word, and&#xD;
picked one, and bit into it, and when she said it was good, Adam,&#xD;
&#xD;
who had been watching, his mouth watering all the while, just&#xD;
couldn't wait-to see whether -it was going to kill her or no, but&#xD;
took it out-of her hand and ate the whole, and threw away the&#xD;
core, and then picked-some for himself, and filled ,all his pockets,&#xD;
and stuffed himself; and when he found his greediness had got&#xD;
him into trouble, he made a proper fuss about her tasting first,&#xD;
and said she tempted him; and then because he was afraid to be&#xD;
left alone he followed her about everywhere, and whined and said&#xD;
he would die with her ; and when they finally got turned,-out of the&#xD;
garden, and had to dig and delve for their living, didn't she see to&#xD;
things, and bring up the children, and keep the life and soul in that&#xD;
silly sheep of an Adam, when he was ready to drop and give up&#xD;
the ghost among the nettles ?"&#xD;
" Oh," said George, making a funny side grimace at Otho, who&#xD;
listened, much amused. "That was the way, was it?   Well,&#xD;
Adam looks grand from that stand point, doesn't he, Groenveldt ?&#xD;
How are you, Adam ?"&#xD;
Otho smiled one of .his grave, half-smiles, and said:&#xD;
"I perceive, Ruth, that you are on the same;platform with the&#xD;
Right Reverend Dr. Perfect, that autocrat among the parsons.&#xD;
He says there is not any devil, and of course he knows. You&#xD;
also have ignored his satanship in your statement."&#xD;
"Oh no," said Christabel, "she recognizes a very mean and&#xD;
selfish one in the first Adam."&#xD;
"Yes, dear, he found appropriate dwelling there, too andhas&#xD;
made himself perfectly at home among his descendants."&#xD;
"Well, what is it ?" asked Ruth, when George had burst into&#xD;
hearty laugh-expecting some telling rejoinder.&#xD;
"I was thinking of some scripture readings I heard once, when&#xD;
I was a boy. I used .to go in those days to visit an aunt who&#xD;
lived up in what-they called the ' black North,' a little beyond&#xD;
the center of civilization, and as they had no rneeting-house or&#xD;
stated minister, they used to assemble in the old school-house and&#xD;
hold what they called 'reading meetings.' A pettifoging lawyer&#xD;
generally stood forth and read the chapter, and a sermon; they&#xD;
dispersed with-out any prayers. One day the sermon selected&#xD;

called for the chapter in Matthew about the seven spirits, and as,&#xD;
his rendering of the text was rather original, I always remem-&#xD;
bered it: 'And he took unto himself seven other spirits more&#xD;
wicked than himself; and they returned and found the place,&#xD;
empty,' sweet and. varnished; and they. entered in and deviled&#xD;
there.&#xD;
Oh, George," said Ruth, in a tone of serious reprbach- "I&#xD;
think that is wicked."&#xD;
"Why, it is true, Ruth ; that was what the fellow made-of it."&#xD;
'"I can't help that. You should not make fun of the Bible."&#xD;
"Well, I like that, now, considering That you began it."&#xD;
Oh no, I assure you I based my statements upon Milton.".&#xD;
"iMilton !".&#xD;
"Yes, truly; Milton has a-great deal to answer for besides his&#xD;
awful crossness to his daughters ; all that about the bower, and&#xD;
the tossing the rebellious angels over the battlements, and Satan's&#xD;
travels, figments of the great poet's imagination, and handed down&#xD;
till they have got to be a part of orthodox theology."&#xD;
'i Miss Goldsmith," said Otho to Christabel, marking her ab-&#xD;
sorbed face, over which played, the gleam of some pleasant&#xD;
thought. " You are about to make a remark, I think ; are you&#xD;
for Adam or Eve ?"&#xD;
" Oh," said she, hesitatingly, and turning red, ".I am ashamed&#xD;
to say'that my thoughts had gone back to the money question."&#xD;
"Pray give us the benefit of your conclusions," said Otho, in&#xD;
some surprise.&#xD;
"I can answer for her," said George. ' Fifteen-year old maid-&#xD;

"'Very likely," replied Chris, with curling lip.&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S 'DAUGHTER.      89&#xD;
&#xD;
" George, please'don't jest about our married life," put in&#xD;
Ruth, with more spirit than the badinage seemed to merit.&#xD;
'As if young -girls were not always. dreaming such dreams ;&#xD;
aren't they, Chris&#xD;
"I am sure I have no means. of knowing," answered Chris,&#xD;
scornfully. "As I don't happen to know any young girls, and&#xD;
rarely hear one speak, of course I can't;receive confidences upon&#xD;
such interesting subjects. My own thoughts Were running in&#xD;
quite a different channel. I was thinking that I should like to .be&#xD;
very rich, the absolute possesswr of a great deal of money."&#xD;
"Indeed !" said Otho, arching his brows,:and looking through&#xD;
her eyes, trying to get a glimpse of the soul within. "You love&#xD;
money, then ?"&#xD;
"Yes, and no. Not for money's sake, to hoard and get mean&#xD;
over, and despise myself about. But there is no comfort to be&#xD;
had without it-no pleasures worth naming. I must see what&#xD;
the world has in it worth seeing ; its grand cities, ancient castles,&#xD;
its mountains and seas; there must be rare sights too down below&#xD;
the blue water, where the sea lions and the sea bears live, where&#xD;
the medusa and the polyp, who count by millions, entangle their&#xD;
prey ; the great powerful castles and high, lofty towers sea ed on:&#xD;
the bottom of the deep, which the 'Iaidens of the ocean,' as the&#xD;
old Greeks called them, build; the blue and olive-green hedges&#xD;
which shine in wondrous light as the day fades. It would be&#xD;
rare and fine to go down and see them. I heard of a diver who&#xD;
brought up a bracelet from the arm of a young girl in a wrecked&#xD;
ship, and he told how the fragile sea plants were growing all&#xD;
around her-(how strangely one would feel to wear that brace-&#xD;
let.) I should like to possess books and pictures, and statues,&#xD;
and vases, and flowers, and handsome clothes, and pleasant per-&#xD;
fumes, and jewels,"--&#xD;
Chris was now fairly launched, and sailing off. } She had drop-&#xD;
ped her fork; and was gazing out before her, with the  rnapt vision&#xD;
which was so aggravating to her mother-so like to her dead&#xD;
father. She was brought up with a round turn by George, who&#xD;
had been listening to her in open-mouthed astonishment.&#xD;

" Hold on! young woman," said he, catching her arm, "you&#xD;
take my breath away. By Jove, I'm   dizzy. You love fone.&#xD;
dresses and jewels ! you, who never know what you have on! so&#xD;
at least Ruth assures me."&#xD;
The merry mischief in his eyes, as. they roved over her form-&#xD;
less= garments,; contrasting them in his thought with her nagnifi-&#xD;
cent-desires, made her feel her absurdityin thinking out loud.&#xD;
She glanced at Otho,-who; was smiling in curious astonishment.&#xD;
She twisted her arm away, angrily, and George burst into a loud&#xD;
laugh, and called out "encore !- bravo!"&#xD;
" I am a nice target for your ridicule, George Blair ; so deli-&#xD;
cate and kind of you. I thank you for adding a fresh luxury to.&#xD;
my small stock of delights-that of hating you, which I. do most&#xD;
heartily."_&#xD;
Regarding him an instant with flashing eyes, she burst into a&#xD;
passion of tears, and. dashed outof the room.&#xD;
" My prophetic father," whispered George, giving vent to a,&#xD;
prolonged whistle, and looking blankly a:tound him.&#xD;
"'Oh, George ! how could i ou ? you know how sensitive she is.&#xD;
You have hurt her' dreadfully."  .&#xD;
"I didn't know," said George, ruefully; "but I'm learning, Ruth-&#xD;
ie, I'm learning; women are rare creatures, passing my understand-'&#xD;
ing. I never should have dreamed that 'there was a sleeping&#xD;

less, clumsy old fellow, -didn't mean anything, and so on;, I will"&#xD;

"There goes the bell! I must be off. I'm not a gentleman&#xD;
of leisure, you see, Groenveldt-wish I was-mean to be some-&#xD;
time. Ruthie shall have her 'carriage then; good-bye, Duck.&#xD;

himself into his overcoat as he went. Did he leave a shadow&#xD;
upon his hearth-stone?&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER SE VENTH.&#xD;
A LITTLE TALK..&#xD;
WrnE Ruth opened the door into the-cold, half furnished par-&#xD;
lor, into which Chris had rushed in her hasty' passion, she found&#xD;
her where she had thrown herself, her face bowed in her crossed&#xD;
arms, resting on the table;. and she still sobbing stormily.&#xD;
"Dearest Christabel," said Ruth, taking the burning head into&#xD;
her loving clasp, and wiping away the wellingtears. "You must&#xD;
not be vexed -with poor George: you know he is always full of&#xD;
jokes: and fun, He is as sorry as anything that he wounded&#xD;
you."'&#xD;
"Don't think me so silly as to cherish anger against him," said&#xD;
Chris, as soon as she could speak. " I assure you there is only&#xD;
room within me for rage against one individual, and that is my-&#xD;
self. Such a silly, cackling, ranting fool as I was to go on ; I&#xD;
got well laughed at, and I richly deserved it. But do you know,&#xD;
Ruth, I forgot all of you, and when George touched me he made&#xD;
meshiver;- such an odd feeling,, almost. as if I had been dead&#xD;
and were coming. to' life again. Your friend thinks me a lacadai,&#xD;
sical idiot,. I know he does'; I saw it in his face as plainly as. if&#xD;
he had put it into words, in spite of the gravity he pulled over to&#xD;
hide it. He very, likely thinks me a vixen, too; I am sure it is&#xD;
of amazingly little consequence to me what he thinks."'&#xD;
."I am sure you are mistaken, love," said Ruth, smiling in spite&#xD;
of herself:&#xD;
'But Ruthie, didn't I overset my chair behind me in my flight.&#xD;
I thought I heard a clatter among the household stuff"&#xD;

&#xD;
The brash moods chasing each other over her face were a&#xD;
study just now, whimsical enjoyment of her -own absurdity,&#xD;
quickly obscured, by a heavy cloud, as Ruth, after a laughing.&#xD;
reply, said to her:&#xD;
"You are battling in secret with a trouble my darling. I .saw&#xD;
it in your face the moment you entered my door this morning.&#xD;
Won't you let your true friend share it? Perhaps I can help&#xD;
you to bear, or counsel you to get rid of it."&#xD;
"Nobody can help me, Ruth,". she replied, with a despairing&#xD;
sigh. -"The one to whom I have a right to look turns the cold'&#xD;
shoulder to me, and systematically opposes me. If I expressed a&#xD;
wish to have but a crooked pin, that would be a sufficient reason&#xD;
why it would be denied me. It's true, Ruth, dismally true. I&#xD;
.may as well give"up trying to be something; I only ask for what,&#xD;
other girls have forced upon them-schooling and clothes. Look&#xD;
at me ! am I'a decent figure? 'Look at that shoe," thrusting it&#xD;
out fiercely, "an4 that blue stocking ! even George made a jest&#xD;

trouble to ask for anything-at school all the time. I only ask&#xD;
to be permitted .to study one year, so that I could be fit to strike&#xD;
out' a life for myself, and be a burden to nobody. I'd teach if I&#xD;
had a chance to learn how; but-no, I cannot be spared ; I must&#xD;
stay put, and fret my days away in paltry detail which I despise.&#xD;
My father never meant me to lead 'such' a life; he told -me often&#xD;
and- often, that we would see the world together. If there was&#xD;
no money I would not complain ; I would take up my lot quietly-;&#xD;
I think I could'shoulder it cheerfully if my mother would let' me,&#xD;
but I know there is no lack of means. My father was rich i he&#xD;
always told meso, and said he was glad for my sake. Mother&#xD;
gave a hundred dollars last Sunday: to the Bengal mission; 'she&#xD;
likes to read her name in the Herald; pious ambition, is it not?&#xD;
I understand that the girls call me, awkward and old-fashioned;&#xD;
Pauline Bradshaw let it out last Sunday in one of her confi.&#xD;
dances. How can I be otherwise ? I never had. any playmates; .&#xD;
&#xD;
don't know how to play.. When the other srun and ,frolic and&#xD;
dance about with gay faces and bright laughter, I, shrink into a&#xD;
corner and look ridiculous. My precious brother told me the last&#xD;
time lie was at home he 'wished he had a sister that wasn't a&#xD;
cow.' They think because I go away by myself and read all the&#xD;
chances I.have, that I couldn't enjoy any other life ; but they are&#xD;
mistaken. There are. times when I long for one girl friend ;&#xD;
somebody to put her arms around me andswhisper to me, and&#xD;
smile in my face. I see, such companionship, but none of it is&#xD;
for me ; I could be.happy as other girls are if shewould let me.&#xD;
Of course I would rather stay quite alone with the pleasures I&#xD;
can have, than .sit neglected and forlorn among fortunate ones&#xD;
who have each a particular friend, and be a mark for ;jokes and&#xD;
ill-concealed disdain. Oh! why did I not die with my papa?  I&#xD;
shouldn't think he could be- happy 'in heaven if he knows how&#xD;
miserable I am. I cannot endure this life-I won't try ! I'll&#xD;
run away; I'll do something so horribly wicked. that she will tear&#xD;
her hair for shame, and rue the day I was born."&#xD;
"Christabel! do you know what you are saying ?" exclaimed&#xD;
Ruth, drawing away from her in stern displeasure.&#xD;
"Yes ; there!1 that's just. Now you turn against me and then&#xD;
my cup will be full!1" exclaimed Chris, burying her face and sob-&#xD;
bing passionately.&#xD;
"I won't, dear; I will keep close to you, and live in your heart&#xD;
if you will let me, and try to help, you. But my own darling,&#xD;
don't give such wicked thoughts any room,; they are dangerous&#xD;
guests. Come now let us look this trouble. right in the eye. ; In&#xD;
the first place, I must tell you how pleased I am that you have&#xD;
at last, given your dress a place among your must-haves; you&#xD;
always ignore it so persistently."&#xD;
Chris glancedconsciously in her friend's face, and colored crim'-&#xD;
son, and threw a shy look toward the door qf thekeeping-room,&#xD;
as if coupling the grave young gentleman who was at that, mo-&#xD;
ment in a brown study, gazing into the coals,;with her new-formed&#xD;
thought.&#xD;

s' How do know'that your mother will' keep you from school?&#xD;
I thought she :had consented to send you this year."&#xD;
"She did; but this morning she coolly told me that she could&#xD;
not afford the expense, and that girls didn't need such a lot of&#xD;
learning, and Chandos takes all she can spare to get him through&#xD;
and send him to college, and I'must help in the kitchen 'to save 'a&#xD;
girl, because she calculates to do her own 'spinning this year;&#xD;
Semantha Pettengill used to do it, you know; and to render the&#xD;
dose more bitter she said she meant to make up a lot 'of sheets&#xD;
and blankets for Chandos out ofthe yarn, against he got married.&#xD;
She "meant to plague me, Ruth, I know she did, by =telling me so ;&#xD;
I know she did, she looked so hard.' Not that I care 'in 'the least&#xD;
how  iuch she does for him, if only I could go to school. But it&#xD;
is of no use, Ruth; you see yourself 'that the only way for&#xD;
me is to subside into a patient dish-washing, sweeping machine.&#xD;
But it don't matter much, only things are not.'fairly divided in&#xD;
this world; I don't see the justice of it. Why have I got tastes&#xD;
which I can't gratify, and love for things I can't get hold of, just&#xD;
'to make me miserable, and my life a weary nothingness. I know&#xD;
mother's doctrine, 'some vessels to honor and some, to dishonor,'&#xD;
but that don't.hit the'spot at all. The money is all in the 'keep-&#xD;
ing of people who 'haven't souls above bread and butter. But let&#xD;
the world wag. Eat and drink, and sleep, and die. It is a curi-&#xD;
ous kind of performance to bring people into the world just for&#xD;
that. But I guess I can stand it ; I don't care."&#xD;
" Hush, Chris, hush !" said Ruth, eagerly, with a startled face.&#xD;
"' Drive out those thoughts. We have a dear Friend, and-He&#xD;
knows just what is g6od 'for us, 'just what discipline we need, and&#xD;
He will give us just as fast' as we are ready to receive. It is&#xD;
certainly so, there's no doubt about it. Dear child, -let's you and&#xD;
I trust Him, and do our best. 'If it is good for you to go to&#xD;

to do it ; but for me ! You never have any wrong desires and&#xD;
horrible wishes."&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITII'S DAUGHTER.         \    9a&#xD;
Ruth shrank away and put up her hands deprecatingly. After&#xD;
a moment's silence .she said in a low voice:&#xD;
"You know me so little, Chris, dear. I am not worthy that&#xD;
you should think so well of me ; I am -not, indeed. - I must tell&#xD;
you a secret. ,E am ambitious ; Ilove grandeur, and sometimes I&#xD;
rebel at my humble lot-absurd, isn't it? The poor teacher, the&#xD;
blacksmith's wife, longing for grandeur ! Oh Chris, dear, you&#xD;
and- I need to pray, ' Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us&#xD;
from evil."&#xD;
"You, Ruth !" said Chris, hushing her sob, and gazing in&#xD;
surprise through her wet lashes. "You! I never'supposed you&#xD;
had any trials."&#xD;
"Nor have .I, dear child, any but what. I make for myself by&#xD;
my foolishness. But come, wipe your eyes, and let us go back.&#xD;
Otho will wonder what has become of us, and. there's no telling&#xD;
what mischief Pigeon has finished by this time."&#xD;
"Oh, Ruth, I can't face that man again. I haven't had time&#xD;
to wonder yet where you picked hini up. Didn't I make a special&#xD;
niddy of myself, Ruth? (with a pitiful attempt at a smile). If you&#xD;
would only be good and fetch my bonnet I could easily drop out&#xD;
of this window. I can leap like my cat; I only wish I could&#xD;
hope always to fall on my feet as he does. I wish I could just&#xD;
blot out the last three hours from the calendar. I want to run&#xD;
home and shut myself up in my room, if I am permitted to reach&#xD;
it before being called back to scour up the pot-hooks, polish the&#xD;
crane, or some other of the useful and necessary jobs that my&#xD;
mother amuses her leisure by contriving for me; something to&#xD;
keep my hands in dirty water, which she knows I abhor ; and&#xD;
everybody says she's such a nice house-keeper. From all these,&#xD;
Ruthie, and so forth; and she'll poke and pry into all the corners&#xD;
to try and find something to keep me till pitch dark; .I know she&#xD;
will; all for my good, she assures me. It's a gay life."&#xD;
Ruth knew the truthof the picture, and only said:&#xD;
"I will let yougo, dear. I know I ought to scold you for&#xD;
your crabbed state of mind. Yau mustn't get to be an habitual&#xD;
grumbler ; you nmst try to feel right. Your opinion of yourself&#xD;

You know where true help comes' from. 'The Lord God will&#xD;
send his angel with thee and prosper thy way."'&#xD;
Chris  looked wistfully at her friend a moment; but the bitter-&#xD;
ness wasstill in her heart, unconquered. As she took her bonnet&#xD;
from her hands she threw her arms around her neck.&#xD;
"I must try to bear it as bravely as I can, Ruthie ; that is the&#xD;
best I can promise.- You are always kind; I thank. you for it.&#xD;
You are the best and dearest friend I have in the world. You&#xD;
must :bear with -me. If you should give me up I am afraid I&#xD;
should go to the bad in earnest. The origin of evil is a curious&#xD;
question, is it not ?"&#xD;
Her lips began to quiver and her eyes to fill again. She dash-&#xD;
ed her hand across them and leaped lightly from the window, and&#xD;
crept softly away, with bent head, and looks seeking the ground.&#xD;
Ruth gazed after the drooping figure with a sigh.&#xD;
"M   -the good Master watch over us both," whispered she, as&#xD;
she turned away. "He only .knows how sorely we need His&#xD;
help."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER EIGHTH.&#xD;
TUE DAY AT CRAIGENFELLS.&#xD;
THE next. day was crisp and cool, and gloriously sunny, and&#xD;
about ten o'clock, Ruth Blair, accompanied by Otho Groenveldt,&#xD;
knocked for admission at the widow Goldsmith's door, and that&#xD;
excellent woman presented herself, attired with her usual prim&#xD;
precision, her black gown'free from soil or stain, her blue check&#xD;
apron. still showing its pristine folds, her hair plastered smoothly,&#xD;
behind her stingy little ears, and the inevitable spit-curl pasted&#xD;
on either cheek.&#xD;
Ruth presented her friend, tand bustled 'unceremoniously in,&#xD;
after her quick fashion; and seating herself on. one. of the&#xD;
straight-backed chairs which the widow affected for her own re-&#xD;
pose, she began talking very fast and with great show of business&#xD;
about the sewing society. She found the widow already fully&#xD;
enlisted in its behalf. Mrs. Deacon. Williams and Mrs. John&#xD;
Bisbee had paid her a visit, and laid its interests before her, and&#xD;
secured her co-operation by naming her as'first directress,:and&#xD;
they also hinted. that she might invite the Bradshaws and Wal-&#xD;
singh iins, saying they were cramped for time, and keeping back&#xD;
the true reason. Though they were of course the first ladies in&#xD;
Millville, they could not be as familiar as they desired in, the&#xD;
homes of the gene descente, and they liked better-that the widow&#xD;
should do the inviting than their journeyman's wife, for. Mrs.&#xD;
Goldsmith, though an interloper, was by virtue of. her marriage&#xD;
with the charming artist gentleman, admitted to full communion,&#xD;
aid Chandy was near and dear friend to. 41 the young folss.&#xD;

WIDOW GOLDISMIITH'S DAUGHTER.        99&#xD;
&#xD;
Poor Chris.was nobody's friend; but though.the boys and girls did&#xD;
ridicule her quaintness and oddities in the merciless manner com-&#xD;
mon to the genus, there were some among them who did try to&#xD;
get within the shell which she always kept close shut at their&#xD;
approach.&#xD;
In spite of all Ruth's preparatory chit-chat, when she demurely&#xD;
came to her real errand, viz., a day's release for her friend, the&#xD;
widow grimly recoiled.&#xD;
"I don't feel as if I could spare Christabel; she didn't finish&#xD;
the work I give her yesterday. I don't think best to encourage&#xD;
girls too much in shiftlessness and - gadding round. I always&#xD;
mean to keep her to home pretty stiddy."&#xD;
"I had nothing to do last evening, and I stitched the wristbands&#xD;
on my Wheeler &amp;amp; Wilson. I only wish there had been more of'&#xD;
'them. Is not the stitch perfect ?  I intend to trundle the machine&#xD;
over and help you a day before the shirts are all done."&#xD;
"They look well enough, but hand-work suits me."&#xD;
"'Eh, old marplot," (said Ruth, inside;) "just to keep Chris&#xD;
busy and spoil her eyes."  Outside she, answered, blandly:&#xD;
"You have taught my 'pretty dear to sew beautifully; every&#xD;
one speaks about it. I expect _she will outshine us all in the&#xD;
sewing society, but the rest have not had such training as she&#xD;
has."&#xD;
The grim corners of the widow's line of mouth relaxed a trifle&#xD;
with this mollifying application, and after some more talk, and&#xD;
sour objections, and several sops from Ruth, the cerberus finally&#xD;
consented to. let Chris go. Ruth always -made it a point to suc-&#xD;
ceed with her, and to turn her victories to the child's profit. She&#xD;
knew thoroughly all the ins and outs of her temper, and had also&#xD;
won her respect, the widow being forced to own that she was a&#xD;
"drefful 'capable woman ;" and there were strong points .which&#xD;
Ruth liked in the widow-her thrift, economy, and business fac-&#xD;
ulty.&#xD;
It may seem odd that a person in Ruth's social position should&#xD;
be hand;and-glove, as she certainly was, with the choice old fam-&#xD;
ilies. It was .due, we know, to 'her worth, her cultivation, her&#xD;
&#xD;
lively, pleasant qualities, which, however, do not always secure&#xD;
to their possessor all they should-when poverty comes,between.&#xD;
In process of "boarding round" she had gotten within the'veil,-and&#xD;
was both beloved and respected by the seniors and young folks.&#xD;
Her husband being a fellow of rare .qualities, was accepted for&#xD;
his own sake as well as hers, though he had too much independ-&#xD;
ence to partake largely of hospitalities which he could not recip.&#xD;
rocate. George Blair was a subject of one of those freaks in&#xD;
human movings, which rudely jostling and shaking him about,,&#xD;
had gotten him that rare union spoken of by Pantagruel, "a cer-&#xD;
tain jollity of spirit pickled in the scorn of fortune:"  He can,&#xD;
tell his story in his graphic, mirthful fashion so much ;better than&#xD;
I can, that I will leave it to come from his own mouth.&#xD;
Ruth meanwhile leaving Qtho to entertain the widow, made&#xD;
diligent search after Christabel. She found her in the kitchen&#xD;
standing before a table on which were huddled heaps of turnips,&#xD;
potatoes, and squashes, which she was preparing for dinner. Her&#xD;
German copy of " Little Barefoot" lay on a corner of the white&#xD;
deal, gagged with the carving-knife, but she was not -studying.&#xD;
Her whole attitude was dejected and spiritless" in the extremes&#xD;
Her heavy hair was wadded up as usual, and her scanty dress cov.&#xD;
ered by an old calico apron, upon 'the corner of 'which she wiped&#xD;
her heavy eyes ; her scarlet lips were feverish and swollen.&#xD;
"Is it well with thee, dear ?" asked Ruth, coming softly up&#xD;
behind her, and kissing her: Chris started at the friendly voice,&#xD;
and quickly dropped one hand to her side-but not soon enough,&#xD;
for Ruth caught a glimpse of a purple wheal on it which looked&#xD;
strangely like the trace of a blow.&#xD;
"What is this, Christabel ?" said she, taking it firmly in her&#xD;
grasp.&#xD;
"Oh, nothing worth looking at," said Chris, with a bitter laugh.&#xD;
4I have got hurt, that's all. You' ask me an odd question, Ruth,&#xD;
as if it could be well with me. But I've done, now,' she went&#xD;
on, throwing back her head and setting het'.teeth; "she shall&#xD;
never have a chance to wound me so' again.&#xD;

"Why, dear child, what has happened ?  Do you mind telling&#xD;
me?   Don't speak if you think you ought not."&#xD;
" There is no ought about it; I shall tell you, of course. My&#xD;
life is no'secret from you; my pitiful disappointments will be no&#xD;
news to you. After.I left you yesterday,. I don't know what pos-&#xD;
sessed me, but I went straight to my mother, and argued with&#xD;
her,.and begged and prayed her toilet me go to school. I spoke&#xD;
of papa; Lam glad"for her sake that you did' not hear how she&#xD;
answered me; -she was-very angry, perfectly enraged, in fact,&#xD;
and said cruel things which were hard to bear in silence, and I&#xD;
am, afraid I replied something, (she glanced down at her wounded&#xD;
hand.)  But I won't go into details ; my hopes are dead. I will&#xD;
never breathe any wish of mine to her again.- You see I've got&#xD;
my, German here ; I've tried to read, but I can't put any heart into&#xD;
it.- Ruth!" she exclaimed in an excited voice, quite different to&#xD;
the tone- she dropped, "I feel desperate. I don't know how to&#xD;
settle it with myself and bear it-I really don't."&#xD;
"Just put the whole out of your thoughts, dear, at least for&#xD;
to-day. .Something assures me that it will all work right yet-&#xD;
I'm certain of it. I have come to invite you to make a cll with&#xD;
me."&#xD;
"A call.!" repeated Chris, in .scornful surprise. "I look like&#xD;
it, don't I? shall I appear in this charming costume? No, Ruth,&#xD;
don't make fun of me; my place is here among the pots and ket-_&#xD;
tles, and here I must abide, where there is no one to putt me out&#xD;
of countenance."&#xD;
"I did not mean a call, precisely-say a visit. I nriust have&#xD;
you to go up to Craigenfells to-day."&#xD;
"'To Craigenfells-!" echoed - Chris, a strange gleam of joy flit-&#xD;
ting over her stormy face. " I haven't seen the old place since I&#xD;
went fishing there with- papa; I used to know every stick and&#xD;
stone of it in those days. Uncle Alec was so good to me, he&#xD;
showed me the;: pictures in the top- gallery, and gave me a heap&#xD;
ofJapan shells, and :papa made a funny story to them. And&#xD;
Deborah cooked tartlets because I said I liked to see her do it,&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW- GOLDSMIThi'S DAUGHTER.            101&#xD;
and we had them in the mandarin china at supper. How pleas-&#xD;
ant it allwas. Ah ! Ruth, I lived then."&#xD;
" Well, dear, you shall renew the acquaintance, and have a-gay&#xD;
day of it. You begin to look alive even now.. There, don't shut&#xD;
your face down again like a mask ; I've a bit of news in reserve,&#xD;
I kept as a bonne bouche. Bertha Groenveldt is there ! You&#xD;
wish for a girl friend ; I've a choice one to offer you, a- sweet,&#xD;
dear, good child she is, and just the double you need."&#xD;
"Did my mother consent to my going? She told me last eight&#xD;
with some pretty affectionate speeches, that she would have no&#xD;
more gadding."&#xD;
Ruth was pained at. Chris's face, while she asked the question,'.&#xD;
but replied quietly :&#xD;
"Your mother .has consented to the expedition, Chris-we&#xD;
won't call it gadding-so don't waste the precious moments. The&#xD;
day won't be too long for us-hurry up stairs. I shall preside at&#xD;
your toilette."&#xD;
'Chris dropped the potato she was peeling, and dar-ted toward&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
"Not that way, dear," exclaimed Ruth, stopping her; "let us&#xD;
go up the back stairs, please."&#xD;
"But Ruth," said Chris, doubtfully, her face falling 'again,&#xD;
"your friend has proper clothes and ornaments, and knows how&#xD;
to behave, and what to say. I shall feel awkward and ashamed;&#xD;
no, Ruth, I had rather not go. I thank you very much 'but gou&#xD;
know I've only that old satin to wear; mother had it when she&#xD;
was married ; I look as if I had been dug up in it. No, let me&#xD;
stay at home, please ; I'm. better here ; I am not all the while&#xD;
painfully reminded of my deficiencies. I'll fall back on my Pen-&#xD;
ny Magazines and Rainbow, and try to be satisfied." " Her voice&#xD;
faltered and her lips trembled.&#xD;
"Nonsense, child !" said Ruth. "I'm not going to all the&#xD;
trouble I've taken to get your mother's consent, to have you sift&#xD;
through in this way; come up directly."  She took her firmly by&#xD;
the arm, and they mounted the stairs together.&#xD;

"Do you take into your consciousness, my, dear, the fact. that&#xD;
we are to have the pleasure of a drive as a first course to our&#xD;
day?"&#xD;
"tDrive! why Ruth, aren't you afraid of those livery horses ?&#xD;
They bite, and kick, and baulk, and all sorts of things." -&#xD;
" Trust yourself to me, dear," laughed Ruth, helping Chris to&#xD;
disrobe.,&#xD;
"Oh, yes, Ruthie; you'll let me drive part of the way, won't&#xD;
you? -I could do it once, and ride, too; papa said I was a famous&#xD;
horsewoman. How delightfully nice ! Do you remember poor&#xD;
Katy Mellon, and how the Irish horse turned his eye -at her ?"&#xD;
"Yes, dear; and apropos to her, I know that there is a box of&#xD;
new books up at Craigenfells; 'George took them out of the ex-&#xD;
press office this morning, and you shall look them over."&#xD;
" Ruthie, you are my good angel. I really am going to be&#xD;
happy this day. It shall be a white day; my soul and I are at&#xD;
peace."&#xD;
Ruth- smiled at her earnestness. "Look, what I have brought&#xD;
you."&#xD;
She unfolded a package containing a neatly tucked white mus-&#xD;
lin apron, with a-dainty frill around it, and natty little pockets,&#xD;
and also some fluted ruffles.&#xD;
" There!".said she, triumphantly ; "a. that I did after Pigeon,&#xD;
went to sleep last, night. Heaven blues Wheeler &amp;amp; Wilson!&#xD;
Just hand down that sober robe of yours, and I'll try if I can't&#xD;
trim a bit of youth into it. If I only had a piece of scarlet rib-&#xD;
bon to make a knot of, but I couldn't compass that,, hunt I ever&#xD;
so much."&#xD;
S "What will mother say ?  She don't approve of ruffles."&#xD;
",I have no time to inquire, my dear, and therefore I can't in-&#xD;
form you. Now your own line of conduct is plain. You are to&#xD;
put away all your silly shyness, 'and aot like other girls'; I know&#xD;
you can if you only think so-you are gay enough with me. I&#xD;
intend to abe very proud of you to-day; Bertha is a good sensible&#xD;
girl, and you will be sure to like her, It is time for you to come&#xD;
out of your shell and do me justice; and Chris, you must do&#xD;

WIDOW GPLDSMIT'S DAUGHTER.              103&#xD;
honor to your papa. I have often written. to Bertha of you,&#xD;
therefore behave your prettiest."&#xD;
I'll try, Ruth, I will indeed," answered. Chris, kissing; her&#xD;
friend gratefully... "You won't expect me to talk very much, will&#xD;
you ? I never can think of anything to say, and when I do talk&#xD;
the girls look at me so."&#xD;
"Suit yourself, dear-I can trust you."&#xD;
"Oh Ruth, do let us hurry and get off before mother thinks of&#xD;
something to keep me at home. I wonder she .hasn't called me&#xD;
before this."&#xD;
"She is quite safe at present," said. Ruth, smiling to herself,&#xD;
and thinking in how competent a warde's charge sewas. "You&#xD;
should sometimes curl your hair, Chris."  Ruth threw the- dress&#xD;
into which she had sewed the ruffles, on to the bed, and dusted&#xD;
her hands together. She had her own reasons for wishing her&#xD;
favorite to look her best. " Here, let me do it for you; I'm a&#xD;
famous hair-dresser ; I shall have a, barber-ous department at-&#xD;
tached to my cooking college."  She took up a hair-brush to&#xD;
commence, but Chris started back.&#xD;
"I dare not," said she, in a low voice, all the color forsaking&#xD;
her cheeks. " I haven't, these- three years;. mother does not&#xD;
like it."&#xD;
Uttering a private philippic upon dame Goldsmith's straight-&#xD;
laced notions, Ruth tried to push away her hands, but she shrank&#xD;
back so beseechingly, and looked so miserable, that she desisted,&#xD;
perceiving that she had deep reasons for her refusal, and said&#xD;
pleasantly:&#xD;
"Oh well, dear, since you won't have curls, let me make you a&#xD;
knot a la Sappho."&#xD;
Deftly, with her nimble 'fingers,, she twisted the billowy mass&#xD;
into a.rare form, and fastened it firmly, suffering two or three&#xD;
stray curls to ripple over the whole in a style which would have&#xD;
delighted Roffe in the depth of his artist soul,&#xD;
" What lovely hair!" said she, with true womanly admiration.&#xD;
" I declare Chris, you- do remind me of ' pure, sweetly smiling&#xD;
Sappho' You have just the poise of head, and the contour that&#xD;

ressing touches. "I must acknowledge to a natural liking for allt&#xD;
sorts of costuming and hair-dressing; now' on with the dress, and&#xD;
a very tidy, comfortable  dreis it -is, not by any means to be de-&#xD;
spised; and our cue is to rise above our gear and adorn it with&#xD;
pleasant'behavior."&#xD;
It was the old black satin, thick as a board, scanty in the skirt,&#xD;
plain in the 'sleeves, tight across the waist, when everybody' else&#xD;
was -enveloped in voluminous drapery. Not a particle of trim-&#xD;
ming of any sort, not even a fold ; but Ruth's little ruffles relieved&#xD;
it, and her jaunty muslin apron quite set it off. Chris stared into;&#xD;
her mirror in whimsical astonishment.&#xD;
"Oh 'Ruthie, how funny I do look ! I ought to pinch myself&#xD;
to make sure  I haven't stepped out of a frame. I'm as much&#xD;
puzzled as the old woman was who went to sleep upon the king's&#xD;
highway; mother threw lMother Goose into the fire, I remember,.&#xD;
and I cried bitter tears over the sad loss, but I was a wee child&#xD;
then. I've a cat at home and she knows me; come here, Rain-&#xD;
bow. Am I? or am I not ?    That is the question. All right;&#xD;
you've settled that point,- old fellow; just one jump now--phit!&#xD;
over you go, good Rainbow. Look here at my ruffles; you never&#xD;
saw the like on your mistress before, did you ? and my funny&#xD;
little apron. What do you think of; that, my cat?  Don't I look&#xD;
as if I had been buried one hundred years ago, atat fifteen, and&#xD;
disinterred this morning to point a moral and adorn a tale of fash-&#xD;
ionable-n utation1?" Seeing a little shade of disappointment in&#xD;
her friend's-face, or fancying that she saiw it, she threw her arms&#xD;
around her' neck.&#xD;
"iDon't mind my fun, Ruth ; it is little enough I have of it. I&#xD;
am grateful to you. I don't know. how I shall ever repay what&#xD;
you do for 'me. You bring me all the sunshine I see."&#xD;
"Yes, dear, but there's a hook off the bottom and an eye off'&#xD;
the top," -replied Ruth, screwing her mouth' out of all shape in&#xD;
vain endeavor to bring the garment to terms.&#xD;
&#xD;
"I suppose so, there frequently is; but you can pin'it up -some-&#xD;
how,' nobody will mind ; make it do for now."&#xD;
"But you ought- to -look over your .dresses, art l sew-on the&#xD;
hooks. It isn't lady-like to go about pinned together-and sup-&#xD;
pose you should sneeze?"&#xD;
" How can I. sew them?" answered Chris, petulantly., "Such&#xD;
odds and ends of time as I have. When. should I ever study&#xD;
any if I spent it all in fixing old duds, that are worthless anyhow.&#xD;
I can't do it. I must have a chance for my life ; it isn't fair."&#xD;
"Never mind, dear; I have it fastened now," replied Ruth,&#xD;
not liking to stir up the troubled currentof 'her thoughts."&#xD;
All dressed except her gloves and handkerchief, Chris opened,&#xD;
her bureau and began to rummage for them, stirring up the disor-&#xD;
derly' contents, and huddling them together, making confusion&#xD;
worse confounded.&#xD;
Ruth forbore to offer any remark, but she' bit her 'lip to keep'&#xD;
down a smile as she watched the process. Silks all raveled, balls&#xD;
of cotton turned and 'twisted about the small articles, so 'that&#xD;
when she lifted one,- the whole "rose en masse. Hooks and ey s,&#xD;
pins, and a thousand strings bound and fastened the conglome, a-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
" Oh dear !" exclaimed Chris impatiently ; "where are rhy&#xD;
gloves ? I never can find anything. Oh, here's one-no, that's&#xD;
the old holiest one-well, never mind, I'll keep my.hands -in my&#xD;
muff; but I've got, to have a handkerchief. Oh, I remember I&#xD;
didn't wash them Saturday, but here's one of Chandos's, luckily ;&#xD;
I finished marking it yesterday. Isn't that a pretty monogram?&#xD;
I designed it myself; I've a dozen to do, and I shall put the next&#xD;
into a wreath of pansies."&#xD;
"-Beautiful'! ";said Ruth, examining. the delicate embroidery.&#xD;
" It looks like a labor of love."&#xD;
"I enjoyed 'making the design, and' liked the working, but it&#xD;
was not a labor of love," replied Chris, truthfully., "I've no rea-&#xD;
son to dote upon Chandos.&#xD;
Ruth glanced -from the cluster of snow-bells and star-flowers&#xD;
so fancifully grouped, into the tossed drawer, and said, rather hes&#xD;

"Don't you sometimes lay over your belongings, fold them,&#xD;
and that, you know ?"&#xD;
"iNot often, I don't have any time ; and where's the use? No-&#xD;
body ever sees them."&#xD;
But you would enjoy your wearables sb much more."&#xD;
"Enjoy! -What is there among that trash to enjoy ?  Perhaps&#xD;
if I had plenty of pretty garments, I might, yes, I am sure I&#xD;
should."&#xD;
"Don't your mother ever come up here ?"&#xD;
",Yes, once in a while ; but she has got to scold just so much,&#xD;
and it don't matter what the topic is. She finds sermons -in&#xD;
stones, and bad in everything I do. I'm getting a perfect duck's&#xD;
back ;facility for shedding scolding. They are mighty few pleas-&#xD;
ant words that I ever get. Oh, there are my gloves now, under&#xD;
the bed. They must have gone down behind when I left them&#xD;
on the pillow after meeting,,Sunday. I would take a couple sof&#xD;
stitches in this thumb if I had a needle threaded. I believe&#xD;
when .I get home I'll mend them all up; if I have a good day I&#xD;
truly will, Ruth. Don't look so grieved ; it makes .me feel a&#xD;
horrible reprobate. If I could always have you by me life would&#xD;
go easy. Now look here," she broke out afresh, planting herself&#xD;
against the door, as if determined-never to remove.&#xD;
" Well, what now ? It needs a nimble fancy to follow your&#xD;
moods. They flit and flash over .your face like sun-chased shad-&#xD;
ows."&#xD;
"This is what now. Where's that tall Mr. Groenveldt?  Will&#xD;
he be up at Craigenfells ?"&#xD;
"I think it quite possible he may, but you need not trouble&#xD;
yourself about him; he won't disturb your maiden meditations.&#xD;
I thought I had  told you he is a medical man, a very close stu-&#xD;
dent, digging among dry bones, he says."&#xD;
""Well, I fervently hope he will remain in the valley till they&#xD;
all come to life, a great army.'"&#xD;
Chris laughed, and offered her shoulders for the mantle Ruth was&#xD;
holding up to her, and buttoned on her fur cap. The two were&#xD;
of. the finest, rarest sable,.purchased for her by her papa just.be.&#xD;
&#xD;
fore his death. - He laughingly said, "as they are to last till we&#xD;
go to Russia for a new set, they must be woman's size.". Mrs.&#xD;
Goldsmith- was furious about it, and had often threatened to sell&#xD;
them, but somehow the deep look which would come into Chris's'&#xD;
eyes, hadn't let her do it yet. It made her feel as if Fred were&#xD;
gazing at her, and strangely enough there were odd times when&#xD;
that feeling mde her tremble-,-but she did not love her daughter&#xD;
any better.&#xD;
"Ready at last !" said Chris, running swiftly down the stairs.&#xD;
Perhaps the noise of rushing footsteps, moved Mr. Otho to open&#xD;
the door; at any rate, there he stood, ready to receive the tardy&#xD;
people with a pleasant smile.&#xD;
When Chris found herself face to face with this man, whose&#xD;
remembered looks were stings to wound her self-love, she drew&#xD;
bick, blushing scarlet, and would have dashed away like a fright-&#xD;
ened deer, but Ruth blocked the wry, and Mr. Groenveldt put&#xD;
out his hand, saying gravely, and apparently oblivious of her&#xD;
trouble:&#xD;
" We began to think you had flown out of the window, you&#xD;
were so long in coming. I know you have a. preference for that&#xD;
mode of egress, Miss Goldsmith; doors are too common place for&#xD;
your airy departures."&#xD;
So there was nothing for it but to put her hand in his, though,&#xD;
she could not find a single word of reply to his speech. Before&#xD;
she absolutely realized where she was, they had taken leave Of the&#xD;
Widow, and were all walking down the long avenue together. She&#xD;
glanced shyly at him, wondering how much of her stormy petu-&#xD;
lance he remembered, and what he thought of it ; and reddened&#xD;
up again as she did at every fresh recall of the scene.&#xD;
Old Thomas was driving in the light phaeton up and down,&#xD;
and at a turn he saw the figures approaching, and pulled the gay&#xD;
horses into a quick trot, handling them with the pride of a true&#xD;
horse-lover ; and he took off his cap and .looked at Chris with&#xD;
fatherly fondness, admiring her height, and praising her good&#xD;
looks, as she held out both hands to him. When Mr. Groenveldt,&#xD;
after handing in Ruth and Pigeon, placed her carefully by his&#xD;

side, the hearty fellow drew the back of his hand across his eyes&#xD;
as he walked away.&#xD;
"Just the age of my own Bessie,", said he, and sighed.&#xD;
After they started, Mr. Groenveldt scarcely looked --at Chris ;&#xD;
indeed, he seemed nearly forgetful of her presence. He leaned-&#xD;
back occasionally, talking to: Ruth, and thus got a full look into&#xD;
her downcast face. She was following the rapid roll of, the&#xD;
wheels with averted eyes, and thinking what rare power and&#xD;
sweetness there was in his voice, and studying the firm, masterful&#xD;
way in which he managed the horses, an accomplishment for&#xD;
which she felt special admiration. Finding that he manifested no&#xD;
intention of making her talk, she felt quite. at ease, and glanced&#xD;
about the pretty sights of "field and fallow" which flitted swiftly&#xD;
past them, and her lips parted in an amused smile at the droll&#xD;
things he so gravely said to Pigeon and Pigeon's mama; but&#xD;
between whiles.she caught herself thinking, as she threw shy&#xD;
looks at him, how stern a judge he would be of any who should&#xD;
go wrong or offend him.&#xD;
Her character-study was brought to a sudden stop, or rather&#xD;
turned into a fresh channel, by a freak of the horses, who took&#xD;
umbrage at the impudent phiz and twirl of a windmill in full&#xD;
revolution, already excited as they were by the gay pace they&#xD;
had been holding, and the clear,' crisp air. With her hands firmly&#xD;
clasping the rail, she watched. their struggles for their own way,&#xD;
and their forced yielding to the will of the master who held them&#xD;
firmly in hand ; she noted the flash in his black eyes, and the&#xD;
slight compression of his lips, which relaxed into a satisfied smile&#xD;
as he forcedthem to pass and repass the object of their dread at&#xD;
a quiet pace, but with swelling nostrils and vibrating ears. She&#xD;
did not turn away, or tremble, or scream, and looked confidently&#xD;
in his face, her cheeks 'glowing, and her eyes flashing, and laughed&#xD;
lightly. He: glanced at her with an answering smile.&#xD;
" They pull terribly," said he, chafing his gloved hands.&#xD;
" You pulled them terribly, I think, sir. Poor fellows ! they've&#xD;
got their lesson."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Unconditional submission," said Ruth. "Nothing less would&#xD;
suit ou, Otho. Will you rule your wife by the strong hand, as&#xD;
you do your horses?&#xD;
" What do you think, Miss Goldsmith," said he, answering her&#xD;
mischievous look with a half smile. "Would I ?"&#xD;
"You love power, and have no objection to implicit obedience,"&#xD;
she replied, quietly ; " although you do tilt at windmills."&#xD;
His eyes kindled in covert enjoyment of the unexpected retort.&#xD;
"You mean to imply that I ani a knight of a rueful counte-&#xD;
nance. You should not indulge in home-thrusts of that sort until&#xD;
you can teach your face not.to' point the allusion."&#xD;
"Oh no, sir ; I'm sure I meant nothing so sagcy. I know my&#xD;
rules of politeness better. I've read the whole sixteen books,&#xD;
and besides Ruth can tell you that I'm on my best behavior to-&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"Ah, that is charming to hear; and yesterday ! may I inquire&#xD;
if that is your usual mode of leaving the dining-room ? A mere&#xD;
business inquiry, I assure you, Miss Goldsmith, as guardian of&#xD;
Uncle Alec's household stuff."&#xD;
She blushed up scarlet, and flashed a bright look at him; he&#xD;
was quite grave, and politely listening for her reply.&#xD;
"Now don't, sir, if you please ; let the (lead past bury its dead.&#xD;
I don't need any such goads to whip me out of my folly. If you&#xD;
had failed having your own way just now you couldn't be more&#xD;
chagrined than I am in remembering my yesterday's behavior.&#xD;
Please drop the topic and speak of something amusing."&#xD;
Ruth laughed heartily, and Otho, bowing, obeyed her hint, and&#xD;
led the talk into themes she loved. She felt quite at home with&#xD;
him now, and in the happiest of humors, her face all unlocked,&#xD;
pretty thoughts adorning it, lighting it up like sunbeams.&#xD;
He touched quaintly and wittily upon subjects they had both a&#xD;
love for-books, music, and foreign lands. She gave him fact&#xD;
for fact, fancy for fancy : not knowing how,'they. got away ariong&#xD;
the palmers, and troubadours, and harpers, and Ruth and Chris&#xD;
listened to. his recital of the " Hermit of Warknerth," and were&#xD;

still following out the romance in their thoughts, when he sud-&#xD;
denly said :&#xD;
"Poor Aymerigot Marcel had a sad fate, Miss Goldsmith."&#xD;
"He ,had, indeed," she. replied, as if she were speaking of a&#xD;
victim of the last railroad accident, "I scarcely think he merited&#xD;
such a finishing. . That cutting people into quarters and nailing'&#xD;
them up at gate-posts was a hideous mode of disposing of them.&#xD;
Bulwer -says the worst use you can put a man to is to hang him.&#xD;
It seems that old Provost of the Chatelet thought otherwise, as&#xD;
well as our own more enlightened legislators. Poor Aymerigot!&#xD;
he must have been a merry, rollicking fellow, and kind and gen-&#xD;
erous, too, after the fashion of the times.. He out-witted old Gi-&#xD;
rardon very neatly, and he and his merry men made fun of him,&#xD;
but they kept their word not to hurt him, and I was very glad&#xD;
when that cruel old Geoffrey Tete Noir got his reward. He who&#xD;
held all men so cheap, and worked his wicked will in Ventadour.&#xD;
I can fancy young Aymerigot when he made the excursion, with&#xD;
his twelve gay companions; how they rode along, jesting and&#xD;
laughing ; stout, brave men, on their- great black horses, which&#xD;
tossed their glossy manes and shook their 'ringing head-gear, and&#xD;
Aymerigot gayest and handsomest of  them all. His wife shades&#xD;
her face with her hand, as they wind across the draw-bridge, and&#xD;
waves her white scarf from the battlements; her maidens look&#xD;
also, with their embroidery in their hands; they have risen,&#xD;
hastily summoned by the clang of the lifting portcullis, and the&#xD;
trumpet-call to horse, and the young knights and the Bannerets&#xD;
glance up at them and catch the farewells from their bright eyes.&#xD;
Their tearful mistress is too much absorbed in her grief, and her&#xD;
eyes too dim and blurred. to heed them. A castle rises before&#xD;
them; the porter keeping watch and ward. They make a thought-&#xD;
less wager, and the 'young and frisky knight,' who shot admirably&#xD;
well with the cross-bow, just picked him off, because he could, to&#xD;
show his skill, and so they got into the castle, and they found the&#xD;
poor warden's wife quite wild with grief, and they spoke softly to-&#xD;
her, and the frisky sharp-shooter was bitterly sorry; and then&#xD;
they got the keys of the dungeons and set all the prisoners free,&#xD;

and let the widow take all her own and great gifts besides ; and&#xD;
it says that when he took a royal castle he gave back a thousand&#xD;
crowns of his share for love of the king's children. It should be&#xD;
a rare sight to see such proud riders, with banners flying, and&#xD;
maybe pretty ladies in the train, with hawks on their wrists. I&#xD;
should like-"&#xD;
Chris stopped suddenly. A violent spring -of the horses, and&#xD;
Otho's impatient expostulation with them, brought her back from&#xD;
the middle ages. The ring of the hoofs, and the clang of mar-&#xD;
tial music died out of her ears, and the brilliant show of coiffured&#xD;
ladies and their armed knights faded from her vision. She passed&#xD;
her hand hastily across her forehead and threw a shame-faced&#xD;
side look at her neighbor, and met his eyes. 'He was studying&#xD;
her with a most amused smile.    She could have bitten her&#xD;
tongue with vexation, and blushed exceedingly when she saw&#xD;
that in her hasty embarrassed hand-motion she had displayed her.&#xD;
ragged finger-ends which she had been keeping so carefully hid-&#xD;
den in her muff. She plunged them in again and clasped them&#xD;
there, and secretly resolved to mend them in her first spare Ino-&#xD;
ment. Mr. Groenveldt's brown dog-skins were perfect, his fur-&#xD;
trimmed overcoat just what it should be, his linen spotless, and&#xD;
all without pretension. Chandy's daintiness aggravated her ; she&#xD;
called it dandyism; but this gentleman-like perfection pleased&#xD;
her taste, and she fidgeted under an evanescent desire to look her&#xD;
best, and the soupcon of a resolve to give heed to her appearance,&#xD;
flitted through her mind.&#xD;
When they reached the Craigenfells, Bertha Groenveldt stood&#xD;
in the great hall-door, impatiently expecting them. She was a&#xD;
bright, pleasant-looking girl, about sixteen, and neither too old nor&#xD;
too young for her years. . Neatly dressed in purple velour and&#xD;
linen collar. Her abundant black hair in thick braids'and fast-,&#xD;
ened with an ivory comb, pretty ear-rings and pin of the same&#xD;
material, of delicate frost.work cutting and the purest whiteness&#xD;
for ornaments. - Short and plump in figure, not nearly so tall as&#xD;
our Chris; 'pretty little hands, whose rosy nails were :cut and&#xD;
trimmed with perfect neatness. Every plait and fold about her&#xD;

&#xD;
in proper shape ; she had a spotless little trifle of a handkerchief&#xD;
with a colored monogram in one corner, bound about her face.&#xD;
She was a martyr to what she called tooth-ache, the doctor said&#xD;
.it was over-study, and as 'all her teeth were clean and sound, it&#xD;
probably was so. She made an eager motion with her out-spread&#xD;
arms, and flew down the steps, scolding Otho (Chris wondered.&#xD;
how she dared) for his tardy coming, to which he gravely replied&#xD;
by desiring her to go out of the wind directly. She instantly&#xD;
obeyed him, and' stood quietly till Ruth bustled in and caught her&#xD;
in her arms. When presented to Christabel, she turned her&#xD;
bright eyes, still floating in tears, and kissed her on both cheeks,'&#xD;
saying:&#xD;
" I know you quite well already, Miss Goldsmith; I hope you&#xD;
will be my friend."&#xD;
She seemed to find nothing odd or ridiculous in the quaint&#xD;
black satin of stiff cut, but offered hoer ready aid in getting off&#xD;
their wraps, and then led the way to the drawing room with&#xD;
a springing, easy step, chatting and laughing all the time with:&#xD;
perfect self-possession. Chris took a fit of terrible shy awkward-&#xD;
ness while she followed her pliant motions, such happy unconscious-&#xD;
ness of her own personality ! and she wished she could only walk&#xD;
about like that, and, talk as smoothly, and she felt sure Bertha&#xD;
must be secretly thinking how ungainly and  tall she was, and she&#xD;
shut up her shell and was heartily sorry she had come. When&#xD;
she tried to answer Bertha's pleasant, trifling speeches, she stam-&#xD;
mered, and made such a piece of work, that Miss Groenveldt look-&#xD;
ed astonished in spite of her good breeding, and feeling sorry for&#xD;
her, she turned away and took up Pigeon and began to coax him&#xD;
with her' watch. He-kept his little fists doubled and his, eyes&#xD;
wide open, but exceeding doubtful, and finally made up his mind,&#xD;
to cry, let what would come of-it, and twisted about and stretched&#xD;
out his arms to Chris with a pitiful lip.;&#xD;
"No, no, sir; -we two have got to be friends. .Don't you inter-&#xD;
fere, Ruth ; I always make it a point to subdue babies, and have&#xD;
my own way with them, if I can't with my big brother. You are_&#xD;
not to 'look to Miss Goldsmith, sir, for protection; all your help&#xD;

and comfort are centered in me for the present. Now com on,&#xD;
and I'll show yoursome pictures. Here's a gorgeous butterfly-&#xD;
he's come to the ball-I thought we should think better of it-'&#xD;
and here's a grasshopper, he's come to the feast. Now kiss me-&#xD;
thank you."&#xD;
These two girls were perfect 'examples Qf the two opposite&#xD;
modes "of training. Chris, conscious of powers she had not&#xD;
learned to use, and which it was her mother's hobby to flout at,&#xD;
and undervalue, was constrained, awkward, and: angular ; her&#xD;
rich inner life was hidden, choked up. She was really the more&#xD;
gifted girl of the two; Bertha had been allowed to talk, and&#xD;
could express her ideas, such as they were, fearlessly. Her&#xD;
mother was her companion and friend, as well as her careful&#xD;
teacher. 'Sedulously trained in all conventional forms, she could&#xD;
walk fearlessly across a room filled with strangers without hitch-&#xD;
ing her shoulders or fidgeting with her hands; she could say what&#xD;
she wished 'without contortions, wriggling,; trotting her feet, or&#xD;
twisting her hair, which poor Chris was always doing when she&#xD;
attempted to open her mouth. Bertha was not afraid simply be-&#xD;
cause she was beloved and supported by her elders at home, and&#xD;
was accustomed to have all her little speeches well received, even&#xD;
if they were not epigrammatic or brilliant, and also to getting kind,&#xD;
indulgent glances and pleasant replies, which helped her out and&#xD;
made her happy.          -&#xD;
Poor Chris, reared on snubbings and snappings, and sharp con-&#xD;
tradictions, had never gotten used to the diet, nor to Chandy's&#xD;
merciless ridicule and unsparing criticism; so she mostly folded&#xD;
her life within itself. Other people thought of her as George&#xD;
Blair had done-quiet, sober, spiritless, duty-loving, growing up&#xD;
to be stamped with her mother's image and superscription. - And&#xD;
a moderate earthquake wouldn't have startled that worthy black-&#xD;
smith so much as Miss Chris did, when she flared up and bade&#xD;
him mind his own business.&#xD;
Otho Groenveldt only remained a minute in the drawing-room.&#xD;
He was superintending the unpacking of some Mexican curiosi-&#xD;
ties which had come up for the cabinet, and Mrs. Blair wisely&#xD;

thought that Chris would, soonest thaw out if left alone with Ber-&#xD;
tha, and she started off to get some new recipes from Deborah,&#xD;
whose cooking was of the very choicest. ,A great card of Span-&#xD;
ish bun had been.. sent down to the Horse Shoe only the week&#xD;
before, and as George admired the "careless method ".withkwhich&#xD;
the cinnamon. and Zantes were adjusted, Ruthie determined to&#xD;
produce some next baking day, and -was immediately busy with.&#xD;
pencil and paper at the end of Deborah's long white table, listen;&#xD;
ing' and writing.&#xD;
Bertha pursued, perseveringly her acquaintance with Pigeon,&#xD;
though he looked fearfully at her from time to time, with his :little&#xD;
lip made up ; and Chris :shrank away to a seat in the deep win-&#xD;
dow, and siezed an open volume lying there on the top of a.&#xD;
zephyr dog with one steel eye 'and the other uncreated. Her&#xD;
eyes lighted pleasantly as she glanced at the tinted page, and her&#xD;
mouth curved into a smile. It was. " Bitter-Sweet," and she not&#xD;
very politely went on reading, with bent head, turning page after&#xD;
page, forgetting everything. She was recalled by Pigeon, who&#xD;
had toddled up to her, and was pulling her dress and trying to&#xD;
climb into her lap. Bertha said, smiling:&#xD;
" Take him up, Miss Goldsmith ; he has shown himself a brave&#xD;
little fellow.. Ah ! you like my book," she added, coming forward&#xD;
and resting her hand familiarly on Chris's shoulder. ".So do I;&#xD;
I love stories, and some poetry, 'The Lady of the Lake,' and&#xD;
those-not much history. I can read Arctic voyages and travel&#xD;
books pretty well; I liked Prescott's- 'Isabella,' and Irving's&#xD;
' Washington,' but I couldn't stand Macauley. I tried Motley's&#xD;
' Dutch Republic,' and the ' Netherlands' because mama wished&#xD;
me, but the horrible tortures made me sick, and I left off; Mama&#xD;
does not permit much miscellaneous reading in term-time, and&#xD;
I've'had to study so hard ; still we had jolly evenings last winter.&#xD;
Papa and mama.and Miss Filer read Shakspeare with me. Papa&#xD;
is so funny in the comic parts; you should see him do 'Puck,'&#xD;
and "Dogberry,' and that ridiculous fellew who 'cross-gartered his&#xD;
stockings. What was his name ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLD S1M!fH' D'AUGIT Enhi11.&#xD;
"Malvolo," suggested, Chris, hritly, shuffling her 'feet, and&#xD;
blushing in the intense effort'it cost to produce the word.&#xD;
"Oh, yes; you know, Shakspeare-of course you do; sRuth&#xD;
says you know everything. Prof. Noble would like me to be a.&#xD;
book-worm, I think, but mama says I must be a 'round charac-&#xD;
ter.'"  Chris laughed a little.&#xD;
"Pot-hooks and hangers are specialties in our house," said&#xD;
she.&#xD;
Bertha did not. hear the odd rejoinder ; she had turned toward&#xD;
the book-cases.&#xD;
"Uncle Alec has got a splendid copy of Shakspeare, full of&#xD;
pictures. I love picture-books, don't you ?"&#xD;
Chris buried her fingers among Pigeon's bits of curls, while&#xD;
she said:&#xD;
" I think of pictures, illustrations,, I mean, such as the Cruik-&#xD;
shanks did for Dickens and Thackeray did, for himself, as Tony&#xD;
thought about the insides of his letters-' the cream of the core&#xD;
respondence,' he said. I consider good, clear, graphic pictures the&#xD;
cream of books."&#xD;
" Tony ! Who is Tony ?" said Bertha, from the . top of the&#xD;
library ladder, reaching after the great Shakspeare.&#xD;
Odd as it may seem, this bit of ignorance, so naturally and&#xD;
fearlessly displayed, did'wonders in setting shy Chris at her ease.&#xD;
She knew something which 'pretty lady Bertha knew not, and she&#xD;
felt it no crime to be ignorant, and dared to ask questions. But&#xD;
you see Otho had not made a butt of his sister, as thoughtless&#xD;
Chandos was accustomed to do of poor Chris, ridiculing her short-&#xD;
comings, finding much mirth in her bhnders. Well, she under-&#xD;
took to relate the tale of ludicrous mistakes, at Miss- Groenveldt's&#xD;
urgent request, and she stammered and stuttered fearfully, fill she&#xD;
got interested, then she sketched away in so fearles'a  style as&#xD;
brought Tony and his friends before her listener, who' turned about&#xD;
with the great volume in-her hands, and seated herself on the top&#xD;
of the steps, with her arms crossed on her lap, and heard it out, and&#xD;
laughed heartily, and then the two got into the deep window, and I&#xD;
am afraid Bertha sat tailor-fashioi, a foible for which she got fre-&#xD;

quent reproof from her mama and' Miss Filer, and always re-&#xD;
plied.&#xD;
" But it is so nice and comfortable, do just let me this once ;"&#xD;
and generally got leave, though Filer would mutter:&#xD;
"Bandy legs and crooked toes," "tailors and Turks," and such&#xD;
like, before she gave in, considering her duty discharged.&#xD;
When Ruth returned to the drawing-room she heard their gay&#xD;
voices, and saw their faces close together over the page, and she&#xD;
paused at the door, smiling to herself. It was so precisely what&#xD;
she wished, and when she joined their laughter, Bertha raised&#xD;
her head and exclaimed, giving Chris's waist a caressing little&#xD;
squeeze :&#xD;
"Oh, Ruth, we are having such a nice time ! My face doesn't&#xD;
ache in the least. I love Miss Goldsmith ; she's exceedingly&#xD;
nice, not to say frisky ; (luckyfor me that Miss Filer is out of&#xD;
ear-shot, or I'd get a lecture.on by-words.)  It was good of you&#xD;
to bring me a new friend."&#xD;
" Oh yes," replied Mrs. Blair, expansively. "I felt sure I was&#xD;
right, and I am very glad; she will be good for you; you need&#xD;
just such a book-lover to spur you on, and it will suit Chris to&#xD;
have a companion like my faultless lady Bertha. Therefore I&#xD;
advise you to make the most of your moments, and cultivate.&#xD;
each other assiduously."&#xD;
"It shall not be my fault," said Bertha, warmly, "if we are&#xD;
not life-long friends. I was fully prepared to admire Miss Gold-&#xD;
smith's-acquirements, you know, before I caine to speech of her."&#xD;
"Somebody has been kind, it appears," replied Chris, coloring&#xD;
up and laughing; then she flashed out, ."You hear Ruth, she&#xD;
calls me Chris.  Do you not like that better than Miss Gold-&#xD;
smith ?"&#xD;
" Dear Chris, you are just as sweet as you can be and live,"&#xD;
said Bertha, kissing her.&#xD;
" But I have only made acquaintance with Miss Goldsmith,"&#xD;
said Otho, from the door-way, bowing low. "Pray present me&#xD;
to dear Chris."&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.       117&#xD;
&#xD;
" No sir," replied..Bertha, merrily. "This is my friend; I am&#xD;
already in the inner chamber of her heart. - You may stand re-&#xD;
tfully in the door-way, and be thankful for any small crumbs&#xD;
of kindness I can spare you."&#xD;
"But," pursued Otho, with one of his grave half-smiles, "I&#xD;
wish also to come in among the chosen few who are privileged&#xD;
to say 'Chris.' I am of opinion that.no less will content me."&#xD;
" Those who ask much receive much. See, Chris, does not my&#xD;
brother look proud in his character of beggar."&#xD;
" How is it to be, Miss- Goldsmith; shall I venture in among&#xD;
the few ?"&#xD;
Chris looked up at him, so - grave and quiet, and felt without&#xD;
analyzing the consciousness, that even the few must stand aside&#xD;
where he chose to be somewhat; and she answered, with bent&#xD;
head and in a low serious voice:&#xD;
"I am such a novice in making friendships, sir. Friend seems to&#xD;
me so sacred a name ; I could not bestow it lightly upon a chance&#xD;
acquaintance. I could not find one of a morning under an old&#xD;
tree, as one finds mushrooms."&#xD;
Just then George's hearty voice sounded in the hall, and Ruth&#xD;
carried Bertha off for presentation to the Giant Great Heart who&#xD;
had appropriated her little teacher.&#xD;
"I am still standing in the door-way," said Otho, when they&#xD;
were alone, " waiting permission to enter. Your last remark&#xD;
sounds inhospitable ; but I hope you will think better of it."&#xD;
".Come in, sir," replied Chris, raising her eyes in secret trouble,&#xD;
both giving greater meaning to the talk than appeared onsthe&#xD;
surface. "I believe you can be a very good and true. friend; I&#xD;
thought so the first day I saw you."&#xD;
" You shall find me a kind and discriminating one, Chris," said&#xD;
he, advancing and offering his hand, and answering her question-&#xD;
ing glance with a grave, serious look into her eyes. "Bertha says&#xD;
I am fond of commanding where I should' entreat. At all events&#xD;
I like to be trusted."&#xD;
" I intend to trust you, sir,". she.-answered giving 'her hand,&#xD;
frankly. "Look, now, am I not 'a lucky girl? I-hake got=two&#xD;

new friends today; I had two before, and one of them was my&#xD;
faithful cat; four is a pretty :number."&#xD;
"Let us shake hands upon it, Chris," he replied,. in a toneof&#xD;
quiet satisfaction, and woe to the first one who breaks our com-&#xD;
pact. Friends found must be life treasures, carefully regarded,&#xD;
not worn, like a glove, to be put off with any caprice. Friends&#xD;
have privileges; I shall claim all rmine. Come with me, now, let&#xD;
us see. what Thomas has to .show us of rich and rare in his con--&#xD;
-servatories. I will wager some of the dry bones which 'are to&#xD;
achieve fame:for me, that my friend Chris loves flowers, and can&#xD;
call them by their names ; she knows all the wild-wood beauties,&#xD;
and such as disport themselves by the water brooks. It may be&#xD;
that Thomas can present her to some strangers; Uncle.Alec is'&#xD;
fond of transplanting his Mexican pets."&#xD;
Chris felt a little flutter of hurry. She and her papa had used&#xD;
to be gay in the green-house, and as chatty as finches. Otho&#xD;
opened the glass door and led the way, and she ,stood once more&#xD;
among her old lovers. There were the cape flowers, and the&#xD;
Australian vines, the japonicas and roses; the sweet air of the&#xD;
place, heavy with perfumes, was so familiar to her ; the.azalias in&#xD;
gorgeous flower, the primroses, the great pomegranates, flaming&#xD;
with vivid scarlet, the goat's-foot oxalis, 'whose odor was like a&#xD;
poem to =her, so. 'penetrating and -tender-all memories of her&#xD;
precious childhood.&#xD;
" This is an odd fellow," said Otho,.pausing beside a spike of&#xD;
yellow blossoms ; "we must get Thomas to name him for us.'"&#xD;
"He is called tritoma," answered Chris, smiling.&#xD;
"Ah, and what is this, and this, and this ?" touching gently a&#xD;
group of broad-leaved neighbors, which sparkled in the spray of&#xD;
the fountain.&#xD;
"Those are all mound plants. They will not be permitted to&#xD;
inhabit here long : coleas, and begonias, and canned and those must&#xD;
soon be planted out. Papa used to call those red things chemical&#xD;
catmint; see, the leaves are the same in shape and as.coarsely&#xD;

lovely sweet when the July sun kisses it; 'and bean-capers, oh&#xD;
dear ! and daphnes, and here is the fraxinella that papa lighted&#xD;
one evening, and it showed a clear, soft flame like a halo all&#xD;
around its great purple clusters-"--and do look! a hermerocallis!&#xD;
prettier and sweeter than a wax lily."&#xD;
She went flitting about among her favorites, -touching them&#xD;
softly, bending among them with wrapt, smiling face, and whis-&#xD;
pering to them, quite forgetful of her quiet ;companion, whiy per-&#xD;
mitted her to enjoy what he saw was a rare pleasure, unmolested.&#xD;
Some of the plants inhabited the scalloped pots, which she 'had&#xD;
helped her father to move and water,-and she caressed them with&#xD;
her fingers, and paused, musing, her eyes fixed upon them, but&#xD;
her thoughts in the past. Her father in his smoking-cap his&#xD;
slender hands and pure, sculptured face, his kind, kind ways, his&#xD;
quaint stories, 'making his flowerapets live and' love for her pleas-&#xD;
ure. She laughed aloud, and thus dissolving the charm, she&#xD;
glanced up 'in. haste. -Otho it was who was by her side, who&#xD;
touched her with his garments; and the anemones were but wind-&#xD;
flowers.&#xD;
'Thomas came along with a 'great knife in -his hand; he had,&#xD;
been cutting his pelargoniums.&#xD;
"Ah, Miss Christabel," said herhis honest face kindling at sight&#xD;
of her ; "you are a great stranger here; I should wonder if the&#xD;
flowers would know you."&#xD;
"I know them, Thomas; I can't forget the good times I used&#xD;
to have up here. I love these, (pointing to the Australian collec-&#xD;
tion,) as dearly as ever."&#xD;
"Oh yes, Miss Chris; in course you must. I'm hoping you will&#xD;
have them back some day. You'll be getting a home with a husband&#xD;
inside and flowers all about it; 'then these will belong there. I'm&#xD;
taking great care of them, and I 'always call them yours. This&#xD;
world is full of changes; you had a heavy loss; yes, yes, and&#xD;
I've laid away my sweet Bessie, too."&#xD;
Chris's eyes filled with tears, which she brushed with hasty&#xD;
gesture as ,he held out her hand to Thomas,'and said a-few words&#xD;
in a low tone.&#xD;

Otho absorbed himself in examining some rare passion-flowers,&#xD;
scarlet, purple, and red, such as make the Brazilian forests so&#xD;
glorious. Presently he called to her:&#xD;
" Look, Chris ; if you and I were walking in the woods where&#xD;
these grow, I would pick -some for you; but these belong to&#xD;
Thomas, and I must beg permission. There is not such an auto.&#xD;
crat living-as your true gardener among his flowers."&#xD;
" Don't speak of it, Mr. Otho. All these belong to Miss Chris&#xD;
in right of her father, who got them over. She shall pluck as&#xD;
many as ever she likes."&#xD;
" Thank you, Thomas; I'll remember that when I go home&#xD;
this evening ; but itdon't matter, either," she continued, her face&#xD;
darkening as she remembered the fate of a boquet which.Thomas&#xD;
once brought her-launched into the swill-barrel and devoured&#xD;
by the pigs ; ''I think I had rather enjoy them  on their stems,,&#xD;
'tis a pity to break them. But.Thomas," she went on hurriedly,&#xD;
, you must cut back these carnations; .see how drawn they are.&#xD;
This fellow is but a robber, after all," lifting a budded plant; "but&#xD;
all effulgens are shy bloomers at best."&#xD;
"Ah, but she's a fine, wise young lady, Mr. Otho; hear how&#xD;
right she- speaks ! It's just so; they should be stocky, but they&#xD;
are not," answered Thomas, rubbing his knife on his palm, and&#xD;
gazing admiringly upon his favorite.&#xD;
" Otho !" called out Bertha from the kitchen door-stone, where&#xD;
she was feeding the Guinea fowls and coaxing a couple of strut-&#xD;
ting peacocks, "we want you to come around here and see these&#xD;
beautiful fish. The gravel is not damp enough to hurt her, shees&#xD;
got no tooth-ache;" seeing Otho's hesitating glance at Chris's un-&#xD;
covered head.&#xD;
" I never take cold, sir," said she, waiting his permission; "pray&#xD;
let tue go. I like to look at pretty fishes and things."&#xD;
He handed her down the marble steps, well satisfied with this&#xD;
behavior.&#xD;
"There, Chris, isn't that a sweet wretch, and worth the bait he&#xD;
cost " exclaimed Bertha, pointing to a fierce-looking fish in the&#xD;
great basket. "I wonder if his name fits his. countenance for&#xD;
prettiness ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"lie's a stranger to me;, I shall have to be presented; come,&#xD;
Thomas, and do the honors."&#xD;
Chri3 stooped over the basket and smiled, without speaking.&#xD;
" Well, Chris," said Otho, watching her face. "What is it ?"&#xD;
"When I saw his brother, sir, he was called 'kusk.' We used&#xD;
him1, I remember, for baiting the muscalonge in the .ake, though&#xD;
they are fair- eating,. I believe."&#xD;
"Just so; right again," exclaimed Thomas. "She knows sucha&#xD;
power of things, Mr. Otho," looking proud of Chris. "I mind&#xD;
well what that handsome little brothei- said: 'I think it is a cuss,&#xD;
Tliomas,' says he, 'and a very ugly cuss,, too;' and his', papa&#xD;
looked up: 'Sir John, my boy,' says he, 'bidle your tongue,' -and&#xD;
the youngster spoke back as gret as anything, 'Yes, papa, I will,&#xD;
I'll say customer.'"&#xD;
" Sir John is your brother, I suppose, Chris," remarked Bertha;&#xD;
"Is he like you ?"&#xD;
"Not in the least," replied Chris, decidedly; "quite my oppo-&#xD;
site, every way.&#xD;
Thomas observed her frowning face, which- darkened gloomily.&#xD;
Though he and Deborah had{not been permitted to approach her,&#xD;
or have her visit them, or even to send her flowers,;they knew&#xD;
something about her life, and he easily guessed her thoughts R'e&#xD;
touched her shoulder with a tender gesture:&#xD;
I gotthose fellows up in Basswood Pond," said he-.."You&#xD;
fished there those .times with your papa, a wee chjck ybuwwere&#xD;

"I shall go to her," said he; picking up his knife he walked&#xD;
slowly away, and busied himself among his flowers-&#xD;
"Are there pickerel in these ponds ?" asked Otho, recalling&#xD;
Chris from her reverie.&#xD;
"Oh no, indeed; they would not bless the man who should put&#xD;
in the first one. Don't you know they would eat up all the trout&#xD;
--great,. savage, gamey fellows,.with their ugly snouts. I've seen{&#xD;
papa play one half an hour, and then he had to use his land-&#xD;
ing net for fear of losing him. I used to sit in the bow of the&amp;amp;&#xD;
boat, and watch them dart after the shining spoon, and swallow it&#xD;
for a rare morsel; and the loons cane sailing slowly around the&#xD;
bend, and. papa laughed at my fright when they 'uttered their&#xD;
lonesome notes. It was such a gay day that; we had a copy of&#xD;
Isack Walton and White's Natural History of Selbourne, and I&#xD;
read aloud,'and learned some verses for him, and he showed me&#xD;
the king-fishers and sand-swallows.".&#xD;
Poor Christabel's conversation seemed, doomed to progress by&#xD;
jerks. While she was running on all aglow with the topic, she&#xD;
oddly enough came to a sudden stop, and looked as if the blood&#xD;
would burst through her tingling cheeks. :Bertha had picked up&#xD;
a hankerchief from the ground,.and busied herself with undoing&#xD;
the knots which Chris had a habit of making while she talked,&#xD;
and was spelling over the monogram to herself.&#xD;
" Chandos it is," said she, "and Chandos: it will be, and not&#xD;
Chris. Which is it, Chandos Christabel, or Christabel Chandos ?"&#xD;
"It is her brother's, I think," said Ruth, in a low voice,-trying&#xD;
to stop Bertha's remarks. But Chris would not accept any such&#xD;
shelter; she blurted out, getting redder:&#xD;
"I could not find any handkerchiefs of my own to-day, and so&#xD;
I took one of a set I am marking for Chandos. That is his name,&#xD;
John Chandos. I rarely can find any of my things, because they&#xD;
are disorderly."&#xD;
But though she punished herself, she glanced hurriedly at Otho,&#xD;
dreading the disgust she expected to read in his face., He seemed&#xD;
not to have heard .the talk.He, was gazing. thoughtfully at the&#xD;
&#xD;
WO-W     QLDSMITH'8 DAUGHTER        °.rX23&#xD;
glittering spire of the tiny.church which pointed Itorheaven half-&#xD;
way up the mountain, silent and alone among the pine trees.&#xD;
Seated at the dinner-table, Otho Groenveldt played the elegant&#xD;
host to perfection. Deborah's cooking was rare and fine: the&#xD;
"lunge" delicate, rosy-tinted, and flaky ; the tartar-sauce creamy&#xD;
perfection, and the pies ! ah, we Americans are the only people&#xD;
who are permitted to.taste real pies.&#xD;
Christabel sat by the host, and the sorrowful curve forsook&#xD;
her lips,: which dimpled into a smile of enjoyment. These hand-&#xD;
some rooms suited her; the rich furniture, harmonious; colos&#xD;
the deep windows crimson-curtained, the glowing grate, the state&#xD;
nes, the pictures,:rare shells and curious corals,. Mexican birds,&#xD;
and shining images, pleased her eyes and kindled her imagine.&#xD;
tion. The rare old china upon- the table, the crystal glass, the&#xD;
quiet order and- pleasant, abundance ,suited her, and aboveand&#xD;
before aJl, the little flower-vase at the right hand of each guest,&#xD;
was a surprise and a delight.. Hers were wind-flowers and -vio-&#xD;
lets, and they lighted her face with sweet thoughts.&#xD;
George Blair's talk was as good-humored as his face was fresh&#xD;
and handsome, and none the less agreeable for being desultory&#xD;
just touching and leaving many topics, imparting to each a flavor&#xD;
which lingered. Our Chris blossomed ont gloriously in the genial&#xD;
atmosphere, and was as widely different from the:silent, spiritless,&#xD;
drooping. girl her mother, knew, as the cinder-wench from the&#xD;
Princess at the ball. She entirely forgot to be shy, a'd talked&#xD;
and laughed so gaily, and.,looked: so joyous and animated as to&#xD;
call up smiles on the faces of her friends. Her voice took sa mel&#xD;
lower tone, and before the dessert came she had laughed aloud ;&#xD;
even Ruth had rarely heard that, a ripple of soft music, marvel-&#xD;
ously sweet to listen- to.&#xD;
:Whenthey rose from the table, and Otho ofered his artnshe&#xD;
took it quite easily, and walked with him into the library, where&#xD;
she plunged with the most absolute gusto into a book'talk, taking&#xD;
down her favorites, one by one, and handling them.with that ten-&#xD;

him with pertineht remarks and comments, which filled him with&#xD;

offered him, and as unconsciously as if they had - been brook-&#xD;

Uncle Alec had a fine fortune, we know, even before he bought&#xD;
and drained the silver mines; -and he used it with lavish hand to&#xD;
beautify and adorn the old homestead he was so justly proud' of&#xD;
1770 was cut in the tablet over the great hall door, and the Craig-&#xD;
enfells had lived there since the first Alec game over, and he was&#xD;
buried in the'sheltered-volley beneath a 'great brown table; sculp,&#xD;
tured with cherubs heads, and setting forth, his many virtues, not'&#xD;
the' least of which was his being a good and loyal subject of King&#xD;
Georges&#xD;
Everything about the library testified to its owner's love for it,&#xD;
as a favorite retreat, the place in which his soul took sweet de,&#xD;
light., Chris sitting there listening and enjoying, as sloe would&#xD;
haveA said, "living,"~ looked around with charmed' eye. Many of&#xD;
the belongings were old friends; the exquisite " Stella ":of pure&#xD;
mnarble, bearing the crescent on her perfect head; the radiant,&#xD;
joyous look of her up-turned face,; the idea of jubilant motion in&#xD;
her airy tread and gauzy wings, flitting through boundless=space;&#xD;
She had studied, it with her papa at .her side, and Uncle Alec in&#xD;
the great smoking-chair by the window. The carved cabinets and&#xD;
marquetrie tables, the marbles and the landscapes, the carpet of&#xD;
warmly-blended colors, the gorgeous blooms of the rare plants,&#xD;
whoseperfume came floating through the open doortof the'llittle&#xD;
bird-cage conservatory, the ivys twining about the pictures, the&#xD;
great book-cases filled with volumes rich and rare, were familiar,&#xD;
and it seemed but yesterday that she, a wie girl with heavy curls,&#xD;
had sat there, loving and. beloved. It was 'as if her childhood&#xD;
came back, and her dear father was still her protector, and'-all&#xD;
the tough places were, smoothed for her. She smiled when she&#xD;
remembered how gleefully he had shown her the'deep grotto cut&#xD;
above the great mantel, (itwas: just finished-'then) lined and&#xD;
paved with shells and !inty rockwork, from=the centerFof which&#xD;
a bright jet'of water spouting through a' frog's month,fell, faintly&#xD;

tinkling, into a basin below; :She begged OQtho to turnit on now,&#xD;
and she: clasped , her hands and, listened to the faint murmur.&#xD;
The mimic mountains in the back-ground,. crowned with temples&#xD;
and saintly shrines, were storied grounds to her: each bending&#xD;
pilgrim, in cockle hat and shoon, who climbed their steep sides,&#xD;
had a history, woven among smiles and gay. talk for her pleasure.&#xD;
The marvelous clock -.where the canaries sang the hours, (oh, they&#xD;
had sung such a many songs since she had been there last,) the&#xD;
great mirror,,before, which she had stood in palpitating wonder ;&#xD;
it reflected a different figure, now, and the ,artist gentlemanwas&#xD;
not there. She went over it all, unconscious that her ne--found&#xD;
friend was lending himself to her changing moods, and. watching&#xD;
the lights and shadows flit over her face, with an interest he had&#xD;
never found in any other study.&#xD;
The view from the great windows was rich in many b ,euties.&#xD;
The vast grounds, rolling and swelling, dotted 'with evergreens,&#xD;
sitting stately and still, waiting for the coming spring to .shake&#xD;
out their soft tassels, and welcome the nesting birds to their thick&#xD;
shelter ; the great ponds in the distance ;; the high mountain, in&#xD;
which were cut rocky steps, winding up, past the little Grecian&#xD;
trifle of alspmmer-house which stood beside .a lake, so clear and&#xD;
cold, rippled and ruffled by every passing breeze, and filled with&#xD;
speckled trout, and then away up to the quiet church, and on to&#xD;
the tower, at whose base she found the white pipe-flowers, like&#xD;
chiseled alabaster., Ah, how well she remembered the day -d&#xD;
the hour she spent leaning, on the heart she loved, and gazing.'&#xD;
down upon. the. wide-spreading valleys and wandering brooks, and&#xD;
quiet ponds, and sheltered homes below her; And hogw  oaring&#xD;
River 'went rushing and shouting its mad music, and dashing over&#xD;
the rocks at petrifying spring. Chris could see it all,' and she&#xD;
fancied that Otho's voice in ringing cadence, mingled with the&#xD;
sounding waters, .and the singing 'in the. tops of the pines; the&#xD;
tones. somehow spoke to, her of hope and joy which should yet&#xD;
blossom inher path and perfume her, life.&#xD;
While these pleasant musings still occupied her thoughts, and&#xD;
the smile yet, parted her lips,:Ruth ,came gaily in, hunaming a'&#xD;

li.vely air, and Otho, laying down his book,'advanced to meet her.&#xD;
He took her hand and drew her away to the deep bay-window,&#xD;
and they spoke together in low tones. Too honorable .to listen to&#xD;
a conversation evidently not meant to reach her ear, Chris rose&#xD;
and walked into the deep curtained recess which overlooked the&#xD;
great' lawi and more distant pine-groves; and her eyes followed&#xD;
mechanically the windings of the shell-walks, turning about and&#xD;
about here and there.&#xD;
Otho seemed'determined to carry a point which Ruth debated&#xD;
and combatted, and 'his voice'sounded firm and masterful as well:&#xD;
as entreating. In the perfect stillness of the room she could not&#xD;
avoid hearing him say:&#xD;
"You have told me often and often, Ruthie, that you loved me,&#xD;
and I always believed you. Trust goes with love; you shall-&#xD;
trust me now."&#xD;
-]tuth laughed lightly, and replied :,&#xD;
"Be careful what you do, Mr. Otho ; my husband is a close,&#xD;
observer, and he will watch you narrowly."&#xD;
"Did you ever tell him, Ruthie ?'&#xD;
"Nonsense, Otho! don't ask absurd .questions."  She seemed&#xD;
to hurry on, ." I believe I must trust you to-night; I can see no&#xD;
harm in it, but if I promise to allow you your own way, which I&#xD;
must do you the justice .to admit you usually take in spite of ev-&#xD;
erybody, you must be very discreet. You have plenty of time;&#xD;
don't rush into anything you will regret."&#xD;
""You may trust me for that, Ruthie," lifting her hand to his-&#xD;
lips, " and thank you, dearest, (forgive the word-it would come&#xD;
--I have not uttered it sinee,) for your compliance with my re-&#xD;
quest."&#xD;
"I think you will utter it oftener than ever, and in fondest ca-&#xD;
dence too," she replied.&#xD;
Facing about, she looked astonished to see her husband stand-&#xD;
ing by the mantel, leaning his head on his hand, and she and&#xD;
Otho exchanged glances. She walked down-the room to him,&#xD;
saYing:m&#xD;
" You here, George ! I did riot see youi come in."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I dare say not, duck, as your back was- turned toward me,&#xD;
and you were too busy talking to hear my footsteps."&#xD;
He went on slowly, and she thought mournfully:&#xD;
" Shall I tell you, Ruthie, what I was' thinking ?"&#xD;
"Yes," she replied, her color rising, and glancing furtively&#xD;
after Otho, Who went out at the door and called to Thomas.&#xD;
" Just this, duck. You ought to have just such a home as this,&#xD;
and'perhaPs I did wrong when I took, you to share my poverty.&#xD;
You look so pretty and so joyous; I heard you singing through the&#xD;
halls awhile ago, and are so at home among these elegant things.&#xD;
I should like to be rich for your sake, little one."&#xD;
"Don't, George !" exclaimed Ruth, throwing her arms around&#xD;
iis neck, with sudden fondness. "You are so good and true, sc&#xD;
nuch better than I. You make me see myself so small, so&#xD;
wicked."&#xD;
When the evening lamps were lighted, they had games and&#xD;
puzzles, and when George glued himself to the book-case, refus-&#xD;
ing to be detached, Otho proposed that they should'each write 'a&#xD;
poem of four verses, giving half an hour tothe task, and prom-&#xD;
ised a ride upon Zephyr, (one of the beautiful Craigenfella horses,)&#xD;
the first fine day, as a reward to) the most perfect composition,&#xD;
he being the judge.' Bertha laughed, and said she was certain&#xD;
of going on foot if riding were made to depend upon the inditing&#xD;
of rhymes, but she sat down readily, nevertheless, with'her pen-&#xD;
cil and paper. These young people, trained to home amusements,&#xD;
never objected to any project which seemed the will of the ma-&#xD;
jority.  Chris snuggled herself cosily into the- soft easy-chair,&#xD;
and took the Faber which Otho pointed for her, and thanking&#xD;
hin with a bright smile, she soon became absorbed in the pleas-&#xD;
ure of her task. She wrote steadily on, till she had finished, and&#xD;
then sat leaning her chin in her hand and gazing dreamily out.&#xD;
once or twice she turned her head toward Otho, and then sank&#xD;
back among her thoughts.&#xD;
" What is it, Miss Chris ?" said he.&#xD;
"Nothing, sir," she answered, dropping her eyes and coloring&#xD;
up.&#xD;

O Dut I am  sure ]'fot were  about ,to  ask  something  of  me; don't&#xD;
be afraid of the new friend; he's not inclined to be dangerous ; I&#xD;
assure you he never eats children."&#xD;
"I could not suffer from such taste if it were yours, sir; I&#xD;
don't come in that category.. IF'don't -think I ever had any true&#xD;
childhood ; if I had it has vanished so far away among the shad-&#xD;
ows'khat I have forgotten the color of it.",&#xD;
I see I shall be obliged to speak your concealed thoug ht.for&#xD;
fot.'"&#xD;
 Youare not able to 'do that, sir, since I do not carry my,&#xD;
thoughts in my hand to -be read at will."&#xD;
"I have been reading your face, however. You fear or decline&#xD;
f6 trust mine; you believe you-would not be safe in my unpractised&#xD;
care: Youdoubt my skill or my strength, or both."&#xD;
"No sir," said she, piqued to an avowal. "No sir, but since&#xD;
you will have me to uiter the folly, I was thinking I should like&#xD;
to ask you if I' might ride as fast as Zephyr could run, in case&#xD;
I' should be thought worthy to ride at all."-&#xD;
"I expected something of the out-of-common sort," said he,&#xD;
smiling; but perhaps you are not aware how odd a request that&#xD;
'i 'for -ayoung maiden to prefer. A gentle trot or a subdued can-&#xD;
ter is all that is taught at Desbrough's."&#xD;
"'Of' course it is bad taste, but I must confess .to a desire to&#xD;
race and run, and outstrip everybody, and feel my face glow and&#xD;
'my heart beat."          S.      -&#xD;
Bertha laughed at her excited face and nervous, clenched hands..&#xD;
"What unexpected things you do bring out, Chris; you are a&#xD;
'1Am I ?" answered Chris, absently, her eyes -looking afar, and&#xD;
her face full of power and will.&#xD;
"Don't you feel as if you might get a, tumble or so, if you go&#xD;
'that  it?" called out George -Blair to her over his shoulder ;&#xD;
disposed to bring her down a little from what he considered false&#xD;
heroics.&#xD;
"he' 4idanot comprehend, his sarcasm, but the laugh which fol-&#xD;
lowed caused her to sink into quietude immediately.&#xD;

"Very likely," she-said,.taking:up; her pencil:indifferently, and&#xD;
turning her back upon them all, she' gazed-out of'-the window.&#xD;
No better task offering for his idle hands, and crayon and paper&#xD;
in tempting proximity, Mr. Otho employed himself in sketching&#xD;
her profile, while waiting for:the others to finish.&#xD;
"Oh, nonsense !" exclaimed Ruth, throwing down her pencil&#xD;
in despair. " I can't think of anything but my. cradle-song. I&#xD;
must leave the arena to younger and brighter heads."&#xD;
" One competitor distanced," said George; and what says Ber-&#xD;
tha ?  She is transformed: into, a rodent, and gnaweth her pencil."&#xD;
"Why, to confess truly, with that_long, brother of mine before&#xD;
me,. I can't get up any rhymes except Otho and poto, and I am&#xD;
afraid those would be too suggestive of the beer he tippled among&#xD;
the frauleins; therefore, may it please the noble judge .that I&#xD;
also retire."&#xD;
"This brings the affair to a fine point. Now, the question is,&#xD;
is Miss Chris worthy to make acquaintance with fleet-footed&#xD;
Zephyr, to. ride and run-to feel her face glow and her heart&#xD;
beat ?"&#xD;
Chris reached out her paper with an averted face.&#xD;
"Read it yourself, please. - It is my province to listenandtprow&#xD;
ounce judgment."&#xD;
Chris fretted a little under his side-winder. "-You. are -ac-&#xD;
countable for the folly," said she, "since you would' have-it spo-&#xD;

" Go on," he answered, composedly.&#xD;
She obeyed, and read' in clear, flexible tones, what she had&#xD;
dashed off, inspired .by her 'happy mood, and the charming influ-&#xD;
ences around her:&#xD;

PTis a pleasant thing to hear,&#xD;
When the anon is. shining elear,&#xD;
The bay ofthe deep-mouthed hound ;&#xD;
And the last bird's lingering note,&#xD;
An the frog's shrilly croak,&#xD;
When the sweet wind whispers round.&#xD;
'Tis a cozy poce to Jie,&#xD;
When the sun is riding high,&#xD;
In the stout tree's trembling shade,&#xD;
On a cool and mossy bed,&#xD;
With a pillow for your head&#xD;
Which the clustering roots have made,&#xD;
Life is full of pretty sights,&#xD;
And her sounds are delights,&#xD;
If our hearts will but listen and hear;&#xD;
'Tis a happy thing to be&#xD;
In a world so full of glee,&#xD;
When the friends whom we love best, are near.&#xD;
Otho sat looking at the young reader ; her profile was turned&#xD;
toward him, and classic poise of her shapely head, with its wealth&#xD;
of shining hair twisted into a graceful knot, and the stray ripples&#xD;
of floating satin caressing her fair cheek, suggested an odd whim.&#xD;
When the last note of the trembling cadence had dropped into&#xD;
stillness, he rose with a smile on his face, his hands lightly clasp-&#xD;
ed,'and his eyes seeking the ground, after his.fashion in his med-&#xD;
itative moods, and disappeared within the conservatory, and pres-&#xD;
ently swung open again the glass door, and returned, bringing a&#xD;
b1n.h of odorous violets.. Corning softly behind Chris, who had&#xD;
not moved or spoken since she dropped the paper upon her lap,&#xD;
but sat with drooping head and thoughtful mien, he laid them in a&#xD;
charming cluster upon her braided hair. With courteous gesture&#xD;
and kindly beaming eyes, half in earnest, half in sport, and some-&#xD;
what ashamed of the fantastic folly, he said to her:&#xD;
"Now are you truly 'violet crowned and sweetly smiling Sap-&#xD;
pho.' It was but the flowers you lacked to bring out the sem-&#xD;
blance fine and clear. Tenth muse, all hail !"&#xD;
&#xD;
She rose and bent before him with modest grace, reaching out&#xD;
her hand for the single flower he still held. He' resigned it,&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"You have earned the ride fairly."  He stooped and picked&#xD;
up the paper, which had fallen to the floor ; " and this I will keep&#xD;
to remind me of my share in the pleasure, for Sappho must not&#xD;
ride alone, and Zephyr shall .not miss his mate."  He folded it&#xD;
calmly and coolly, and hid it in his vest.&#xD;
Bertha looked.-in simple amazement at the two, and Ruth&#xD;
broke in upon them with a laugh:&#xD;
" Of a truth great minds do run in the one channel," said she.&#xD;
"It is patent that you will have to be christened anew. Sappho&#xD;
fits you best, therefore Sappho you shall be."&#xD;
It was a thousand pities, but the happy day came. toits close&#xD;
at last. The games were all played, the nits and trifles all eaten;&#xD;
the fire burned low in the grate, the waxen candles wasted to&#xD;
half their length; still the friends seemed unwilling to separate.&#xD;
George was first to move, rising into his favorite attitude--chest&#xD;
thrown out and head back, and punishing himself with little blows&#xD;
on the vast expanse of which he was justly proud. Smiling down&#xD;
at his wife, he said:&#xD;
"It is time to leave the enchanted castle, and descend into the&#xD;
valley. You are pledged to follow my fortunes, little woman, and&#xD;
you must move on now."&#xD;
" Whither thou goest I will go," answered Ruth, with such&#xD;
tremble in her voice as made, him look earnestly at her.&#xD;
After an interchange of promises between Chris and Bertha to&#xD;
see each other often, Pigeon was taken up, fast asleep, and whis-&#xD;
pered over, and kissed, and wrapped up for his drive. Otho dis-&#xD;
appeared and soon returned in his fur-trimmed overcoat and&#xD;
beaver cap, and stood with his gloves in iis hand, giving a last&#xD;
order to Thomas, who said, "Certainly, sir ; and 'tis a gret night&#xD;
for it, too."&#xD;
"Well, Groenveldt;" laughed George, "you are a rare' fellow.&#xD;
It is not every one has the sense to take such care of himself.&#xD;
You are as elaborately wrapped as if going on a journey, instead&#xD;

of standing on the piazza a few minutes to see us off. I like&#xD;
that; I believe in coddling nature; she will treat you all the&#xD;
better for the respect you show her."&#xD;
Otho darted a keen look at him. His face was as bland as his&#xD;
tone was hearty. Then he stepped up to Ruth.&#xD;
" Let me take the boy," said he. " Excuse me, George, if I&#xD;
usurp your place for a few minutes; my claim ante-dates' yours&#xD;
by years."&#xD;
4I wish you would not say such ridiculous things, Otho," whis-&#xD;
pered Ruth, as she resigned her sleeping Pigeon.&#xD;
Otho laughed*at the face;she pulled on, but looked provokingly&#xD;
proud and'perverse.&#xD;
They all stepped out into the calm moonlight, and found&#xD;
Thomas in readiness with the close carriage, into which Ruth&#xD;
was handed, and received her baby into her motherly arms.&#xD;
George took Chris's hand, to place her by .the young matron's&#xD;
side, but Qtho held her back, and, drawing her arm within his&#xD;
own.&#xD;
"I shall take care of this young lady," said he. " Sappho must&#xD;
trust to my guardianship to-night. We cannot have moonshine&#xD;
like this by the asking, and though a coach is a safe tenure for&#xD;
family people, I have other entertainment in hand for Sappho.&#xD;
Tramp and I understand each other;.-so bid her adieu and God'&#xD;
speed, for there's no telling when your eyes may behold hpr&#xD;
again."'&#xD;
George looked at him in astonishment, and Ruth opened her&#xD;
nouth to speak, but he stopped her peremptorily.&#xD;
"I will have it so, Ruthie ;" and kissing his hand to her, he&#xD;
motioned George in, and bade- Thomas drive on.&#xD;
' Now Bertha, for you I shall prescribe sudorifics and going to&#xD;
bed. Deborah will' have to sit up for her lord, and she can let&#xD;
me -in on;my return, that is if I ever do return. Sweet sister,&#xD;
good-night."  He kissed her fondly enough, but in a masterful,&#xD;
lordly way, and shut her in. "No more night air for you," said&#xD;
he. He led Chris around to the side, porch, where a light car.&#xD;
riage was in waiting, harnessed to a coal-black horse, who pawed&#xD;
&#xD;
the ground restlessly, and laid his pointed ears close to his sleek&#xD;
head as they approached.&#xD;
" Just one moment, Sappho; keep your hands in your muff&#xD;
while I make ready."  He took off the blanket, folded it mechan-&#xD;
ically, examined the harness, and patted the shining' neck of the&#xD;
impatient animal. . " Yes, yes, Tramp, my boy, we are off pres-&#xD;
ently. You must keep your temper, lad, and you must step out&#xD;
bravely to-night. Miss Chris thinks you look like Bavieca.; she&#xD;
hasn't told me so, but I read it in her eyes. Are you afraid of&#xD;
Tramp, Sapphp ?"&#xD;
" Not at all," she replied, decidedly. "I love horses, and I&#xD;
feel sure I could make them love me; it is humanity that makes&#xD;
me afraid,"&#xD;
Mr. Otho pondered this answer as he tucked her carefully into&#xD;
the wolf skins, where she sat, like a young Russian Princess,&#xD;
so be-furred was she. Neither spoke much during the first&#xD;
half of the drive; Chris was too full of yearning happiness,&#xD;
which in its back-look on the past- and its onward glance down&#xD;
her future became almost like pain. .They passed George and&#xD;
Ruth mid-way down the hill, and, gave them  "good-night" as&#xD;
they trotted by. Speeding past Echo Lake, black and waveless&#xD;
under the moonbeams, Tramp pricked up his ears and snorted&#xD;
at something he saw, or fancied he saw, in the low larches, and&#xD;
shied out dangerously, jumping on all his four feet at once, and&#xD;
kept his -dilated eyes fixed on the spot.  A  sharp rustle, a&#xD;
quivering of the branches, and asmall animal, dashed. out .and&#xD;
sprang right across his track, and a white owl above ,them sung&#xD;
out a. dismal " to whit. to woo," which acut the clear air like&#xD;
a knife, and sent the blood leaping through Chris's heart, it&#xD;
was so sudden and so shrill. Tramp was beside himself, and&#xD;
reared and leaped with mad bounds over the narrow road, a&#xD;
plunge from which into the fathomless depths of the dark water&#xD;
on one side, or down among the tangled bushes and sharprocks&#xD;
on the other, would have been death for all. There were a few&#xD;
minutes struggle for mastery between the frightened, desper te&#xD;
beast and the determined human will, and Chris sat in absolute&#xD;

stillness, with compressed lips and blanched cheeks, only laying.&#xD;
one of her hands upon Otho's knee; her eyes, with her soul in&#xD;
them, were fixed on his dark face, so full of determination&#xD;
and nervous power.   When by dextrous, hand and soothing&#xD;
Voice he had subdued black Tramp, and forced him to acknowl-&#xD;
edge his authority, and- they were swiftly trotting along the&#xD;
winding road, Otho turned to the young girl and said quietly:&#xD;
" Why did you not scream, and sieze upon the reins?  Perhaps&#xD;
you are not educated. to the knowledge that such was the young&#xD;
ladyish thing to do. You are the firstgirl I ever haw who would&#xD;
not have perilled her life and mine by that line of conduct. You&#xD;
were terribly frightened, I know, for your eyes dilated like a&#xD;
deer's, and I could almost hear your heart beat. Was it human-&#xD;
ity or the brute which terrified you this time ?"&#xD;
" Both, I believe," she replied, smiling. "I retained sense&#xD;
enough to keep quiet though, because I felt sure you would be&#xD;
offended if I seemed to doubt your power or skill. a I had besides,&#xD;
a faith in Tramp's chivalry, and confidence in your ability to&#xD;
manage him and take care of me."&#xD;
" Did you feel sure- of that ?" he asked, with secret exultation,&#xD;
which she neither saw nor understood.&#xD;
"Oh yes, sir, quite sure ; and yqu are better and more merciful&#xD;
than I expected. I thought you would punish Tramp for misbe-&#xD;
having."&#xD;
" Do you think me so terribly savage ?"&#xD;
"Oh no, not savage, sir ; but I know you do not like to be&#xD;
thwarted or disobeyed."&#xD;
"Ah, Sappho, you ar a close little reader of the humanity you&#xD;
are afraid of."&#xD;
When Otho left Christabel at her mother's door, he took off his&#xD;
cap, and put out his hand kindly.&#xD;
"Good night, Miss Goldsmith," said he ; " may I come to see&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
"If you please-that is-I don't know as my mother-per-&#xD;
haps," she stammered, her awkward shyness taking full possession&#xD;
&#xD;
of her, upon her watchful parent's threshold, whose glamour&#xD;
spread itself even beyond her door-stone.&#xD;
Otho studied curiously her changing' face, which tried to shut&#xD;
in her emotions, while her eyes, which had sought his so fearlessly,&#xD;
turned away in shy trouble. The gay smile had fled from her&#xD;
lips, and her hands fidgeted among her furs. The transition was&#xD;
sudden and startling, and grave Otho pondered it deeply as he&#xD;
and Tramp retraced the road over the hills to Craigenfells.&#xD;
Chris lifted the latch and passed in, as from fairy-land, to her&#xD;
bare, meagre life; yet not quite the same, for. her day of joy&#xD;
could not be forgotten.                              -&#xD;

CHAPTER, N I N T H,&#xD;
RAIN-BO:W IN TROUBLE.&#xD;
EXCELLENT Mrs. Goldsmith was sitting, rigid and expectant,&#xD;
before the coals, stabbing her stocking with her clicking needles&#xD;
as it had been an enemy, and looking about as pliable and pleas-&#xD;
ant in her motherhood as if she had stayed herself with her grid-&#xD;
iron.&#xD;
There be mothers, God bless them, who are glad to see their&#xD;
returning children, coming gleeful and joyous from a youthful&#xD;
merry-making, and who greet them with pleasant welcomes and&#xD;
dear smiles, and sit down cosily over the dying embers, their&#xD;
genial faces beaming with sympathizing expectancy, to hear all&#xD;
their darlings have said, and done, and seen, and enjoyed. They&#xD;
give them fond kisses and tender words before they dismiss them&#xD;
with warm feet and warmer hearts to their slumbers; mother-&#xD;
loveblessing them and glorifying all their world.&#xD;
Excellent Mrs. Goldsmith was made of sterner stuff. She&#xD;
despised all blandishments as of the earth, earthy; and she turned&#xD;
about like a crowbar, i* a hole "when her only daughter timidly&#xD;
opened the door.&#xD;
"Well! you have really thought best to come home at last. I&#xD;
should a thought you'd a stayed all night while you was about it.&#xD;
Left the gate wide open, I suppose, just like you."&#xD;
" Oh no, mother, I am sure I shut it ; I was careful to go back&#xD;
on purpose to see."&#xD;
" Humph! well, if you was careful it was about the first time&#xD;
in your life, and worth tellin' on."&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW 00LP"MITfl'S DAUGHTER.             137&#xD;
Chris was passing'on, when her mother stopped her.&#xD;
"What have you been about all day ? Nothing worth hear-&#xD;
ing, I'll engage. Why can't you speak up? I should suppose you&#xD;
might open your lips, after leaving' me without a soul to look at&#xD;
all day; selfish eretur, don't care nothing for nobody, never did."&#xD;
As Chris failed to "warm up and wax communicative with this&#xD;
adjuration, her mother commenced jerking aggravating questions&#xD;
at her, eyeing her keenly, as if she suspected her of some shame-&#xD;
ful slip, and must draw the confession out of her by sharp prace&#xD;
tice.&#xD;
"Did they dance up there ?"&#xD;
"No, mother."&#xD;
" Play cards ?"&#xD;
"No, mother."&#xD;
"You've been into something you're ashamed on, or you'd tell&#xD;
what you have been about. I expected it when I let you go."&#xD;
Thus encouraged, Chris detailed in a few words, and :without&#xD;
any enthusiasm, the events of the day, which recital was received&#xD;
with sniffs and contemptuous snorts, and cutting remarks on&#xD;
worldliness, and light-mindedness, and -withering quotations from&#xD;
her favorite volume, which had a"truly inspiriting and comforting&#xD;
effect upon her fine-grained, sensitive daughter; and when that&#xD;
poor child crept out of her presence she felt uneasy and oppressed&#xD;
under a general sense of wrong-doing, though she could recall&#xD;
nothing improper in her behavior, and she half resolved, with a&#xD;
heavy sigh, never to go anywhere again.&#xD;
This was the usual effect of Mrs. Goldsmith's motherly watch&#xD;
and ward over the soul she had thrust among life's 'trials, and she&#xD;
called after her, as she slowly ascended the stairs-what ? A&#xD;
loving " good-night, darling, pleasant dreams to you ?"  Not at&#xD;
all.&#xD;
"I s'pose I can go to bed now; 'you've had your good time out,&#xD;
and kep ine out of my natural rest, and me as tired as a dog, on&#xD;
my feet all day, while you've been galavanting round. I hope you&#xD;
are satisfied."&#xD;

WIDOW GOLDSMITB'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why, mother," replied Chris,- pausing on her upward jour-&#xD;
ney, and looking down with troubled face ; "I am sorry you sat&#xD;
up for me ; I could not come any earlier, but I might have locked&#xD;
the door myself."&#xD;
"As 'if I would trust you ! You wouldn't have known whether&#xD;
there was any door behind you or not. You needn't expect to&#xD;
lay abed because you've been rolicking and frolicking, nobody&#xD;
knows where,.till this time of night, nor you needn't get up look.&#xD;
ingas if you had been drawed through a knot hole, neither.&#xD;
There's them shirts to finish, whether or no. Do go along to bed,&#xD;
what are you stopping there for, with- that.candle guttering and&#xD;
sputtering in the wind? You wouldn't never think .to pick that&#xD;
thief out on't, if I didn't bawl to you.: Go along, do, out of my&#xD;
sight."&#xD;
Chris hurried off and shut herself into her room. She sat&#xD;
down on the side of her bed, and her heart sank within her. Go-&#xD;
ing rapidly over her conduct since the morning, she could recall&#xD;
nothing wrong, and she put away her depression with a strong-&#xD;
effort, took off her cap and placed it in-her fur box, carefully&#xD;
folding her mantle, she laid it in also, and shut the lid. The&#xD;
room was freezing cold, but she had a task in hand, and she com-&#xD;
menced-it by turning out the contents of her bureau in a promis-&#xD;
cuous heap on the floor, and proceeded to arrange neatly and&#xD;
tidily the heterogeneous mass. She was working out a new res.&#xD;
olution,:and though her teeth chattered and her fingers ached, she&#xD;
persevered till her candle-end flared in the socket, (she was not&#xD;
allowed whole candles, for fear she would read up-stairs,) and&#xD;
she was forced to undress and creep into bed in the waning moon-&#xD;
light, leaving her task to be completed in the morning; ,and she&#xD;
lay awake long, turning over the events of her gala-day, smiling&#xD;
at her thoughts, and recalling every look and 'tone of the actors,&#xD;
as only those do whose happy times are few and rare. "There's&#xD;
a -life above this dreary detail ;" this was her mental conclusion,;&#xD;
" oh, let me come out into liberty and enjoy somewhat, and I will&#xD;
try hard to be thankful and good."  With this. prayer and&#xD;
&#xD;
promise upon her lips, she slept totlive the day over again in her&#xD;
dreams.&#xD;
After taking leave of her young maid in her parlous sweetiand&#xD;
most motherly way, Mrs. Goldsmith addressed herself tow the&#xD;
task of mixing her dough, or, as she would have said,: "whack-&#xD;
ing up a batch of bread," before seeking the 'solitude of her&#xD;
couch. She tied on her ample check apron, and washed her bony&#xD;
hands, 'and picked her nails, and then measured out the flour and&#xD;
sifted it harshly,,poured in the emptyings and the milk, dropped&#xD;
in the salt, all in 'so forbidding a manner that a spectator might&#xD;
have feared the mixture for rank poison. She kneaded it with&#xD;
punches and poundings, punishing, it fearfully, all the while turn-&#xD;
ing over the information she had gotten about Craigenfells. She&#xD;
had inquired what they had for dinner and for supper, and other&#xD;
particulars, greedy to learn what she affected to despise. 'At&#xD;
length she rounded up the white mass, and covering- it with a&#xD;
table-cloth, folded and interfolded, she put it 'down before the fire&#xD;
to rise, and straightened her' back, her labor done, her adversary&#xD;
doomed. Then she carefully covered the embers, and swept the&#xD;
hearth, and after pinning a shawl over her ears, and inducting&#xD;
herself into a shrunken woolen garment which she was in -the&#xD;
habit of considering a night-gown, she laid herself down, drew&#xD;
the bed-clothes over her stiff shoulders, and her snores soon an-&#xD;
nounced that Morpheus had received her into- his unwilling arms,&#xD;
a most rigid and proper burden. She slept the sleep of the just.&#xD;
Now there arose a faint rustle upon the night-stillness, and&#xD;
from under the chintz valance of the old lounge appeared a masse&#xD;
ive head, followed by four 'double paws, ands with' a. serpentine&#xD;
glide, and a quietly waving tail, Rainbow, Chris's :favorite cat,&#xD;
walked carefully abroad, reconnoitreing the premises. He had slip-&#xD;
ped deftly past his young mistress while she was all in a tumult&#xD;
between: her' two lives, the without and the within, and cleverly&#xD;
hidden himself with the intention of a quiet and comfortable night,&#xD;
before the nice bed of embers, when his ancient enemy should be&#xD;
safely disposed of, and the coastquite. clear.&#xD;

Now'rainbow was a ramousteharaeter in his way, and fought&#xD;
and managed his place in the world with a boldness and dexterity&#xD;
worthy of all praise, and made himself comfortable in spite of&#xD;
Dame Goldsmith's besom, and her anathetnas, and was a source&#xD;
of infinite pleasure to, his young-.mistress' who loved him like -a&#xD;
dear friend. He 'could open any door in the house, (Brookside&#xD;
wasr anold-fashion'ed mansion, and la%ches*'wre still in use there;)&#xD;
he would hangon with one pa* and play the thumb-piece with&#xD;
the'other till it yielded, and then he would enter, his mottled tail&#xD;
softly waving, and his double paws planted as squarely as a leop.&#xD;
aird's, his yellow eyes winking and blinking in the most in,&#xD;
concerned manner. .He always knew when the widow's hard face&#xD;
meant particularmischief, and rarely allowed himself"to be cor..&#xD;
nered. -He was never in the way cr .under foot; he never aslied&#xD;
for anything. toy eat, though he took ;coinplacently any. delicacy&#xD;
whidh was offered him, candy, raisins, and the like, and was alt.&#xD;
ways leek,,'plump,'sand well-fed at somebody's 'expense; and he&#xD;
purred for 'Chris, in, their -hours, of confidence, like 'a 'cheerful&#xD;
cider-mill in full action.&#xD;
AllIthe neighbors knew him, and he would take sudden likings&#xD;
to one, or.other of them, and follow the friend of the hour about&#xD;
like -a dog.{ He often went sporting with Peter Bradshaw, and&#xD;
got arbird or a fish for 'his -share of the' game. He walked de-&#xD;
murely among the chicken'cops and broods -of young ducklings,&#xD;
as though he had never palated the flavor of tender fowl; and&#xD;
though thiir numbers were sometimes; decimated, it was laid to&#xD;
theaccoiint of foxes and skunks, and' such outside barbarians; it&#xD;
could never 'be brought home to Rainbow.{&#xD;
Little Pauline Bradshaw'and Gracie Jenkins used to dress him&#xD;
up in baby-things, and he would suffer himself to be night-capped&#xD;
andadorned at their -sweet pleasure; only sometimes he would&#xD;
vary the game by leaping from' his crib, where he had been curled&#xD;
up, pretending to be sound asleep, though all the-while watching&#xD;
his chance out of the corner of his eye, and scour away like :mad&#xD;
with them shouting and laughing in his wake, evidently enjoying&#xD;
the fug in the serene depths of his catly soul.&#xD;
&#xD;
He chose odd-pets,,and. justnow was taken up with .a- 'poor&#xD;
little orphan duckling, who had somehow got launched upon the&#xD;
pond of existence at an inopportune period, and he was us d to&#xD;
fondle and play with it as if it had been a kitten. He would&#xD;
turn it over on its back and kick and bite it,.and lick it all over,&#xD;
and talk and purr to it ; and ducky loved its furry friend, and&#xD;
when Bainbow was sitting in the sunshine, with; l4d double paws&#xD;
ewdled, under hin,i quietly dozing, he, would be aroused,by a&#xD;
plaintive "quck " in his ear, and the orpha-would waddleup,&#xD;
with hid shining feathrs; glistening and flashing, and rub his&#xD;
glpssy green head against the yellow and black coat of his lordly&#xD;
prQtectqo, and challenge him to a play.&#xD;
oII bought hom.e strange trophies, and, laid themat Chris's&#xD;
feet: great green bnUl-frogs, speClied toads, scarlet and black:efts,&#xD;
such as,:lie perdue beneath mossy rocks, lizzards, which ome&#xD;
forth only in the night-time, and: shy birds:which haunt the din&#xD;
forests, When ay little children came to Brookside, he always&#xD;
went hunting for the~ni, first making sure in his own mind' that&#xD;
they were friends of Chris, and would never .return without a&#xD;
vqtive offering. He pinned his faith implicitlyto Chris, and&#xD;
would beg for and swallow a portion of whatever he ,saw her eat-&#xD;
lng, and would often help himself toa favorite morsel,, a walnut,&#xD;
or raisin, before Chris could convey it to: her mouth, hooking it&#xD;
deftly out of, her fingers from his chosen place on her shoulder,&#xD;
*where le would lie with his face close to-her little roundiear, as&#xD;
if 4e were whispering secrets.&#xD;
He went atealing. about the great kitchen, purring; softly to&#xD;
binialf, and encountered the huge pan on the hearth, and after&#xD;
smelling it he put a paw softly in; finding it hice and warm, he&#xD;
put in another, and then cudd himself up in a ballaxactly in&#xD;
the center of the folded cloth, and with a prolonged pur, a high&#xD;
of intense enjoyment, he sank peacefully to rest.&#xD;

thingelse. Glancing outinto the kitchen through her half-open&#xD;
door, she spoiled a yawnohe had commenced to indulge in, by&#xD;
breaking it off' with a jerk, and snapped; her false teeth together&#xD;
like a steel-trap, her eyes fixed in a frowning. stare upon her pans&#xD;
of dough. Rising with an exclamation which did not sound like&#xD;
a blessing, she siezed her besom and dashed to the onset.. Too&#xD;
late, however; for Rainbow, who was constitutionally a light&#xD;
sleeper, was up and away before the first corned extremity&#xD;
had touched.the floor. Then there ensued such a stampingand&#xD;
tramping, such "scatting" and scolding,,as aroused Chris from her&#xD;
dreams, and caused her to fly to the stair-case in horrible dread.&#xD;
of some frightful catastrophe. Thieves ! Fire ! Robbers ! The&#xD;
great tribulation ! With trembling hand she undid the latch, and&#xD;
peeped in just in time.to see. her mother sprawl all around a foot-&#xD;
stool, with grotesque scattering of her formless limbs, and Rainbow&#xD;
vault over his prostrate foeand scamper past her up the stairs,&#xD;
with enlarged tail and eye-balls; of green fire, as if the fiends were&#xD;
at his heels, instead of a poor pious old lady. -&#xD;
"Pesky cretur!"- muttered the widow,' gathering herself, and&#xD;
rubbing her damaged shins. "Pesky, good-for-nothing cretur!&#xD;
I'll lay him out as ,stiff as a bean-pole afore I'm a day older."&#xD;
Christabel retired unseen from the field of action, and made&#xD;
haste to dress herself, but not till she had buried her face in her&#xD;
pillows and had out the laugh she could not repress. - When she&#xD;
came down stairs she-found her mother too wrath even to scold,&#xD;
and stalking about with pinched lips and most forbidding eountes&#xD;
nance. She was busy with a plate of minced veal, into which&#xD;
she poured a white powder,, (she stood on a chair to reach it down&#xD;
from the  top shelf of her pantry.) :Having mixed it well with a&#xD;
stick which she afterwards threw into the middle.of the fire, she&#xD;
called--..L&#xD;
"Kitty, kitty!"&#xD;
Rainbow, safely bestowed in Chris's bed, respectfully declined to&#xD;
listen to they voiceofthe charmer, and only moved one-ear back-&#xD;
ward and' pointed-the- other toward the door, and :looked as sly as&#xD;
if he had eaten- the canary.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Dum cretur ! he shall come ; I've made up my mind to kill&#xD;
him, and I'm goin' to do it, if it costs me a lawsuit. Here, you=&#xD;
Chris, you land that cat of your'n down here in less'n three shakes&#xD;
of' a lamb's tail. I've fixed him up a nice breakfast, and. you&#xD;
shall feed it to him."&#xD;
"Oh, mother!" pleaded Chris, with dilated eyes ; " what is it ?"&#xD;
"It's libeled arsenic; some call it rat's-bane; I guess it will do&#xD;
for cat's-bane now."&#xD;
The widow drew down her lids half over her shining black&#xD;
beads of eyes, and straightened her purple lips over her teeth, in&#xD;
grim enjoyment of her joke; but she carefully avoided meeting&#xD;
her daughter's glance.&#xD;
" That cat will be dead carrion in about the space of half an&#xD;
hour. Walk him down, I tell you."&#xD;
"I can't do it, mother ; it would be wicked murder. I can't&#xD;
kill ny best friend ; don't force -me to do it. Dear Rainbow, he&#xD;
shall not stay in the house another night."&#xD;
"No, I don't intend he shall. Come, march ! be off!"&#xD;
Be merciful, mother ; don't take away the only thing that loves&#xD;
me."&#xD;
For answer to her appeal she got a smart blow on her cheek,&#xD;
and a headlong push toward the door.&#xD;
" Go out of my sight, white I can keep my hands off of you,&#xD;
if you know when you are sell off."&#xD;
i She did go, creeping up stairs with bent head and fast-falling&#xD;
tears, and calling her .pet, e came and jumped on her lap and&#xD;
licked her face. She covered him with kisses, and held him close&#xD;
and buried her cheek in his soft fur; but her breast heaved, and&#xD;
her eyes gleamed. She chafed indignantly under "the cruel des-&#xD;
potism.&#xD;
Her mother's sharp voice struck her ear:&#xD;
"You'd best make haste up there. I'll be up myself pres-&#xD;
ently."&#xD;
She forced down her grief, and set. -her teeth, and with the&#xD;
noble animal lying trustingly in her arms, she slowly descended.Z&#xD;

"You:nasty brute ! I'll kindle a fire in yQur in ides  You&#xD;
won't need my dough to warm you up after you've swallowed the&#xD;
nice little breakfast your mistress is go' to, give you."&#xD;
She set the plate down on the hearth, and told Chris to, put the&#xD;
cat beside it. He smelt at it, and rubbed his head against Chris's&#xD;
dress, but would not touch it.&#xD;
"You makehim eat it, you Christabel, or I'll have you poke it&#xD;
down his throat with a stick."&#xD;
Chris said not a word, but taking up the plate, she carried it&#xD;
out on to the door-stone, and called Rainbow. He galloped fear.&#xD;
lessly after her, and plunged. his nose into the mess. She could&#xD;
not wait to see him eat it, but went back and shut the, door, quite&#xD;
sick .her face like marble, and such pitiful eyes as would have&#xD;
made your heart ache. The widow went and peered out of the&#xD;
window.&#xD;
"There.! he's et the last mossel on't," said she. "You needn't&#xD;
set there, doing nothing, come, stir round; you may go out and&#xD;
look at your only friend--he's done for himself."&#xD;
The two sat down to breakfast. Chris could not touch any-&#xD;
thing, but the widow partook with the particular relish which a&#xD;
welspent morning gave her; and then Chris gathered ,up the&#xD;
dishes, and, prepared to wash them.. Passing to and fro, she, by&#xD;
.n unaccountable impulse, slowly approached the .window, and&#xD;
gazed fearfully out. She knew beforehand the sight which must&#xD;
greet ;her eyes,:but could snot refrain from looking. Poor, poor&#xD;
Rainbow ! her darling companion, stretched dead upon the turf,&#xD;
with frothing mouth and convulsed limbs.&#xD;
Could she believe her senses ! She ru bbed her eyes and look-&#xD;
ed again. Was that Rainbow capering and frolicking among the&#xD;
flying leaves ; racing, chasing among the light flakes, as merry as&#xD;
a grig, and as nimble, light-footed, and graceful as only he could&#xD;
be?  The widow, who was watching to see how her daughter&#xD;
bore her salutary discipline, was amazed by the bright smile&#xD;
which glearmed like a sunbeam all over her face, and came up to&#xD;
the window and peered out.&#xD;

A&#xD;
&#xD;
" Mally -' she sobbed, and sank down beside her child. The&#xD;
suffering creature's purple lips were parted and her chest heaved&#xD;
with every gasping breath. Ruth lifted her a. little, and wiped&#xD;
the death-damp from her face. As she did so, the small head&#xD;
fell back, the pinched, starved features contracted, a few -more&#xD;
laboring breaths, a qpick, sharp struggle, and she was gone. Nu&#xD;
more hunger nor pain! She veiled her face with her wings i&#xD;
the sudden brilliance of glory which the wide-swinging of the&#xD;
pearly gates showered upon her.&#xD;
"And there shall be no night there, and they need no candle,&#xD;
neither the light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light;&#xD;
and they shall reign forever and ever."&#xD;
Ruth laid the poor pale little body down softly. She pushed&#xD;
back the hair from the ghastly wound, and closed the eyes which&#xD;
might have been pretty if they had seen less of want and sorrow.&#xD;
The poor mother looked up as she felt Ruth's tears upon her&#xD;
hand, and she mingled a blessing with her prayers for the dead.&#xD;
"Another of us gone," she murmured. " I'm thinkin' it's me-&#xD;
self'll soon follow them."&#xD;
Ruth was moving about the desolate place, after she had ar-&#xD;
ranged the body for the coffin, and wishing she could do some-&#xD;
thing to take the heart-ache out of the mourner, when she saw&#xD;
Sonsie's eyes fixed on her, from the bed in the corner. She.was&#xD;
shivering with the cold, and hugging her arms, her head resting&#xD;
on her drawn-up knees, trying to keep down the hunger-pang&#xD;
which was devouring her.&#xD;
"Come, Sonsie, come home with me. I will keep you awhile,&#xD;
and see what I can do for you; perhaps I can find you a service;&#xD;
there are enough here without you."&#xD;
She rose quickly, tossed off her shock of black hair and smiled.&#xD;
" I must not leave her alone with the dead. But I'm wild with&#xD;
the hunger," she whispered;. "It gets the better of all the rest&#xD;
of my feelings; I can hardly be sorry for little Mally, I'm so&#xD;
starved. I thank you kindly, but I'll stop here."&#xD;
" Indade, ma'am,. but I'd be pleased and glad for her to go,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Eagan; "and the blessings of all the saints go wid ye&#xD;
for a kind lady to the poor."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER TENTH..&#xD;
SONSIE FIGHTS IT OUT WITH.HUNGER.&#xD;
WHILE Ruth Blair was standing inside her little gate, that&#xD;
Craigenfells evening, waiting for George to unlock the door, and&#xD;
listening to the quick tramp of the horses over the frozen road,&#xD;
and thinking her private thoughts, she espied in the clear moon-&#xD;
shine her little Irish friend trotting toward her, at his best speed.&#xD;
She called out as he approached:&#xD;
" What's amiss, Dennis, my boy ?"&#xD;
" Mother says will ye be plase to come quick, ma'am; our little&#xD;
Mally is passing away." He was quite breathless and sobbing.&#xD;
Ruth hurried into the house, where George was raking open the&#xD;
bed of coals, and punching sparks out of the back-log.&#xD;
" Oh dear, George ; that poor child ! I must run right away&#xD;
down there. 'Won't you just undress the baby for me?  Here's&#xD;
his night-gown, and you know the song, ' The cricket sings under&#xD;
the hearth,' and the rest of it. Sing it good and slow, there's a&#xD;
dear fellow; and don't whistle any, please. I don't suppose I&#xD;
shall have to stop long. Poor little sufferer; maybe she'll be&#xD;
gone before I reach there; I almost hopeso. The clean robes,&#xD;
white robes, which Sonsie has learned to sing about, are waiting&#xD;
for her up there, I'm sure."-&#xD;
When she and Dennis reached the poor place,.they found the&#xD;
mother on her knees beside the child, wringing her hands and&#xD;
moaning. Going quietly up, Ruth dropped a soft touch upon her&#xD;
shoulder ; the poor creature turned a haggard, woeful face to her,&#xD;
and lifted her hands piteously as if she could help her.&#xD;

" Come then, Sonsie; you've had nothing to eat to-day, I'm&#xD;
afraid. We dined out, -and I'll have Dennis- bring the chicken&#xD;
for the rest."&#xD;
" The young ones got some cold pieces, but there was so little&#xD;
of them, that Dennie and me we couldn't touch them. He's a&#xD;
brave little -bit, is ennie." She stooped over the lad, who had&#xD;
been leaning against .her, and threw her two arms around his&#xD;
neck: "Don't give over, dear," said she; "it's many a sorry&#xD;
tramp we've had, but it didn't kill us, did it? and we'll fight it off&#xD;
yet. He'll go with you, ma'am, and bring the food for mother;&#xD;
she don't know how hungry she is."&#xD;
" You are quite right, Sonsie," answered Ruth, thoughtfully.&#xD;
"You ,must stay.here till little Mally is buried, then come to me,&#xD;
and I'll see what I can do for you. I'll remember Dennis, too,"1&#xD;
she added, smiling at the look which Sonsie gave him. '" I'll&#xD;
come early in the morning."&#xD;

CHAPTER R ELEVENTH.&#xD;
TH1E IRISH BABY.&#xD;
RUTH had quite a task to get Pigeon to sleep that night. The&#xD;
cricket had sung under the hearth to no purpose, in his father's&#xD;
rendering of the cradle-song, except to make him more wakeful&#xD;
and eager for a frolic. He did drop off at last, however, and&#xD;
Ruth sat down before the fire and crossed her chubby hands, arid&#xD;
looked musingly into the glowing coals, before she laid her fingers&#xD;
on George's knee, and said&#xD;
"Now that it has all exploded and blown over, I don't mind&#xD;
telling you what, a wiid scheme I have been nursing, though I&#xD;
know you will make fun of me."&#xD;
"Well, duck,"' said George, laying down his differential calculus&#xD;
good-humoredly, in whose depths he had been burrowing, "dome,&#xD;
I'm all attention ; you are preparing to ask charity of dame Wil-&#xD;
liams, perhaps."&#xD;
'" No, no," replied Ruth, laughing, and shaking her head; "not&#xD;
so bad as that, though she has redeemed her reputation by send-&#xD;
ing d  n a string of onions, two pairs of stocking-legs, and some&#xD;
pants or Dennis, ragged in places, but then she thoughtfully did&#xD;
up some patches in the bundle, only the pants were blue and the&#xD;
patches green."&#xD;
" Good for dame Williams! But the wild scheme-I am very&#xD;
impatient."&#xD;
George threw a curious look at Ruth, and waited to hear&#xD;
whether her confession would bear upon the events of the day.&#xD;
" Well," commenced Ruth, folding her check-apron in fine&#xD;
plaits, and looking at it with her head on one side ; " well, I was&#xD;

thinking of adopting that poor little Irish baby. It is a girl, you&#xD;
see, and I thought I should like to save one misery from the great&#xD;
crowd that is weeping about the world; and then all my pretty&#xD;
baby-clothes ; Pigeon 'has out-grown -them, you know. In fact,&#xD;
the idea has not been out of my head since I looked into that old&#xD;
boat of a cradle, and saw that helpless wretch set afloat so; I felt&#xD;
as if I must pick it up and save it."&#xD;
"My prophetic father !" said George, softly.  'I don't really&#xD;
see the particular necessity of taking in babies out of the general&#xD;
fund; but it was like your kind heart to wish to help the poor&#xD;
thi-g, duck," he added, noting the rising color on his little wife's&#xD;
cheeks. " You may keep Sonsie if you like ; she may be of ser-&#xD;
vice :to you.&#xD;
"Yes; but she is only a servant, and I wanted a little girl to&#xD;
bring up with Pigeon."&#xD;
SOh, that is the logic," replied George, 'laughing. "Well,&#xD;
duck, I think baby girls are nice little articles myself; I wouldn't&#xD;
mied eight pr ten of them, about the place, all in good time. I&#xD;
think I;should niake a famous jolly old patriarch ; and the young&#xD;
maidens are sure to be good and pretty like you, Ruthie. If that&#xD;
blamed rotary will only work so as to pump up the needful for&#xD;
frocks and aprons; if that won't something else shall; your hus-&#xD;

up at Craigenfells ,to-day, duck; your eyes sparkled, and your&#xD;
face was all over dimples. It is fine, the dolce far niente. What&#xD;

self into so intense a conetenation of calculations upon the' diffi-&#xD;
cult problem as to become entirely oblivious of all outward objects,&#xD;
and though he held Ruth's hand in a close clasp, it was evidently&#xD;

left off:&#xD;
"And what turned you from your virtuous design, duck ?"&#xD;
" It would not work. I mentioned it to Mrs. Eagan, and =at&#xD;
first she was delighted, but that very 'afternoon a travelling priest&#xD;
came along, what she calls a 'missioner,' in truth a bare-foot friar,'&#xD;
to confess the flock who swarmed out to him, and I suppose she&#xD;
asked ghostly counsel. At all events, he ordered her to abandon&#xD;
the idea at 'once, and told her that it would be sre perdition for&#xD;
the orphan to give it over to heretics; and much better for it to&#xD;
die crossed with the 'holy water, all ready to go to heaven, even&#xD;
if it.starved to death, than to sell it to the devil, (meaning me;)&#xD;
and he threatened her with excommunication, and I don't know&#xD;
what all, if she dared to disobey him. She was very loth to tell&#xD;
me, and I had to screw it out of her by the hardest, and I don't&#xD;
know as I should have got it at all if Sonsiehad not helped me.&#xD;
That girl will make a hard Catholic for any priest to manage;&#xD;
she is a self-reliant little piece, and as sharp as a needle;"&#xD;
" Just like them!" exclaimed George, bringinghis fist down on&#xD;
his knee, from which Ruth snatched Fher plump little hand, with&#xD;
a wry face, and clasped it in its fellow.&#xD;
" Beg pardon,.,duck," (kissing the offended member,) "I beg&#xD;
ten thousand pardons; but it roils me. I late- them-regulai-&#xD;
dogs in the manger; they won't educate their people, and: they&#xD;
won't let us do it; but we will in spite of them. Why only last&#xD;
Sunday Pat Brady was read out of church because he would&#xD;
send his children to the district school. The men were all up&#xD;
about it, at the forge, and Father O'Gorman Came in for some&#xD;
hard names. There will be a great struggle here some day;&#xD;
strange that 'our people don't wake up to it; more roasting and&#xD;
broiling, if they get the upper hand. Popery is a quiet' tiger just&#xD;
now, but it is a tiger, as 'thirsty for power as ever."&#xD;
"I hope our Pigeon will not be here when the struggle comes,"&#xD;
said Ruth, shuddering.&#xD;

"Jem Scollins said rather a good thing up at the fore the&#xD;

yes Yankees expect to- be holding the country when your women&#xD;

stock the country for ye, and, we'll give it the good Catholic faith.&#xD;
to save your souls in spite of yes, that the devil is licking his auld&#xD;
chops for entirely:"&#xD;
George put one of his feet upon the old-fashioned fender, and&#xD;
admii-ed the fierce lion's head on the toe of his slipper, and then&#xD;
brought his Mouth close to Ruth's ear, and asked--for what, think&#xD;
you, a kiss? not at all-a .piece of mince pie. She rose and&#xD;
fetched it, but remarked, remonst1atingly:&#xD;
" You will see your grandmother before morning, if you eat&#xD;
mince pie this time of night."&#xD;
"Well, I have no objection to grandmothers, duck. I hope to&#xD;
see you one some time. I'm hungry, Ruth; an awful feeling. I&#xD;
heard of a convict the other day who said he. should'like to get&#xD;
such a dinner as would make him dream that the devil sat on his&#xD;
stomach with Bunker Hill Monument in his lap. - He must have&#xD;
been a poor starved chap, mustn't he, Duck."&#xD;
'Ruth brought the pie and set it down to warm, and seated her-&#xD;
self on George's knee for a little more talk. She loved dearly to&#xD;
talk, did-Ruthie, especially with her husband ; so she spread out&#xD;
the fingers of his large hand and fitted her little one to it, finger&#xD;
by finger, and said:&#xD;
"Tell me something nice, George."&#xD;
"What a greedy little duck for news,; always saying, 'tell me&#xD;
sorieth ig,' but 1 have got a thing to tell worth hearing. I have&#xD;
,had a proposal to leave the Gonecussets, and go into business.&#xD;
My friendY IHawkshurst is the party, and' I believe we could make&#xD;

" Blacksmithing ?" asked Ruth, working carefully to get her&#xD;
little finger into rank, and looking closely at it.&#xD;
"Of course," replied George, with a restless movement; "you&#xD;
know I am not ready for anything else; I've got no capital. I&#xD;
cannot stand Deacon Williams much longer. The good man is&#xD;
too tricky for me. If he would pay money I might live, but as&#xD;
long as he compels me to buy our supplies at his store, at his&#xD;
own prices, he takes it out of me too chunky. I must free my -&#xD;
self from his clutches; I've been talking up. a co-operative with&#xD;
the workmen ; the Gonecussets are in a fearful wax about it, but&#xD;
they shan't shut my mouth, though I do hate to take money of men&#xD;
whom I despise. Captain Slocum is a brick and Bisbee well&#xD;
enough, but Deacon Williams and that Hitchcock-a precious&#xD;
pair! One reason I am willing to trust Haux. is, he isn't a pious&#xD;
cuss, and don't run a Sunday school."&#xD;
" Oh, George Blair !" exclaimed Ruth, springing up and point-&#xD;
ing her finger ; " you must not say such things."&#xD;
" Well, duck, I won't; but it makes me sick to see how much&#xD;
of that livery there is worn to serve the devil in. Sit down&#xD;
again."&#xD;
Ruth accepted the invitation, and returned to the subject under&#xD;
discussion.&#xD;
"It is a horrid bother to have to get all our things at the Gone-&#xD;
cusset store. I could get a better piece of merino at Starbird &amp;amp;&#xD;
Pedlow's for a dollar than they offered me for a dollar and a half,&#xD;
just the color I liked, too; but no, I must put up with dull blue&#xD;
when I wanted scarlet, and Pigeon looks lovely in scarlet; be-&#xD;
sides I never go there but I feel like the old woman I saw at the&#xD;
counter buying a table-cloth. ' I'll take this,' said she, humbly,&#xD;
'if you can spare it.' The clerk said her husband was over head&#xD;
and ears ins debt to their "&#xD;
"Yours is not, duck ; I owe no man anything. I think that&#xD;
pie will do now, Ruthie."&#xD;
"I think we had best go-to bed," pointing to the clock in the&#xD;
corner. "You are such an owl, George."&#xD;

&#xD;
Ruth flew about briskly, and with a very thoughtful face, while&#xD;
George ate his pie. When all was done, she came and laid her&#xD;
hand on his shoulder.&#xD;
"George, there's one thing that it is good to remember. God&#xD;
can fix it just right. We shall have just as much prosperity as&#xD;
is good for us. He can take care of the Catholics, arid of&#xD;
Pigeon."&#xD;
"You always refer things to God, Ruthie, and it is very sweet&#xD;
of you, but my thoughts don't point just that way. I should like&#xD;
to take hold and -help on myself. Things look 'dreadfully mixed&#xD;
sometimes."&#xD;
" Your mother was a good woman; she trusted and had to&#xD;
leave her boy alone in the woi-ld, as we may ours. It is good to&#xD;
know that there is power and love beyond ours, without variable&#xD;
ness or shadow of turning."&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER TWELFTH.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE   FIRST   SEWING    SOCIETY.&#xD;
THE great Thursday dawned brightly. Mrs. Blair was up to&#xD;
see it accomplish the feat: the putting on of the -gold and violet,&#xD;
and the rest, for which see sacred poems by N. P. Willis. She&#xD;
did not tarry long at the show, for she had weighty matters in&#xD;
hand which she wished to bring to light, to wit, biscuits and loaf&#xD;
cake. The whole house had got to be turned upside down, swept&#xD;
and dusted, and set in order again. The young housekeeper's&#xD;
ideas had grown somewhat with what they fed on, and ,she was&#xD;
resolved to have the children of the four or five Roaring River fam-&#xD;
ilies she knew best, and so make the'assembling do duty as a tea&#xD;
fight, as George was used rather irreveranfly to style such festive&#xD;
occasions, at which he could assist with the most enjoying gusto.&#xD;
She gave an inquisitive business-glance at the world, that is,&#xD;
so much of it as she could see from her window, somewhat shut&#xD;
in by hills and over-topped by the bald-headed: pinnacle.&#xD;
"A very fine -day, for which let us be thankful," she said, as&#xD;
she lowered the sash and prepared to plunge into her business&#xD;
occupations. She got her cooking into a-good state of forwardness,&#xD;
then. she opened the best room and looked about. Its barn-like&#xD;
size and .general barrenness somewhat discouraged her; she pulled&#xD;
the furniture about into new 'places, and drew the straight-backed&#xD;
chairs up together, in the bootless endeavor to give them a cosj,&#xD;
free-and-easy air, as though they were accustomed to society, but&#xD;
they would look poor, and, thin, and stiff, and as primias Mrs.&#xD;
Goldsmith in her best bombazine.&#xD;

&#xD;
" Oh dear !" said she, pounding dust out of the old sofa with&#xD;
her little fist ; "if I only had a wishing-ring, I might have an&#xD;
easy-chair, and a couple of ottomans, and a mirror ; but then it&#xD;
would be just as easy to wish for half a million or two or three&#xD;
millions. ' Monte Christo' is a book to set one dreaming; dia-&#xD;
monds and rubys are so cheap in books ; just a dash of the pen,&#xD;
and-presto! there you are, gleaming in jewels. I don't find&#xD;
wishing makes me much the richer or any the happier, therefore&#xD;
I shall-h'm-h'm-let us see-at any rate I should like to be&#xD;
rich-I will say so--it is nice up at Craigenfells ; George felt it.&#xD;
How can I-    something to stand in the corner---hum-i'll make&#xD;
a. barrel-chair !"&#xD;
She ran down cellar, found a barrel, emptied the withered beets&#xD;
out on the floor, and raised quite a cloud with her dusting and&#xD;
scrubbing. "A little musty or so," saiA she, poking her head into&#xD;
the interior, "but that can't be helped; people have difficulty&#xD;
sometimes in getting rid of the flavor of their early lives. Now&#xD;
then for the wood-saw.  I'll get it up into the kitchen first,&#xD;
though."&#xD;
It was a tug, but she managed it, and began to scrape the saw&#xD;
back and forth on it, as resolutely as though she expected to finish&#xD;
directly ; but the obstinate thing only wriggled, and squealed, and&#xD;
scratched, and no more, and she sat down and wiped her hot face&#xD;
in comical desperation, and looked at it.&#xD;
George came softly singing down the stairs, in his shirt-sleeves.&#xD;
He stopped in:the midst of a vigorous gymnastic exercise he was&#xD;
putting his muscles through.&#xD;
"Why, duck !" he exclaimed in amazement, looking at Ruth,&#xD;
and the barrel, and the. wood-saw by turns. " What's the pro-&#xD;
ject "&#xD;
"Something you will have to do for me, I am afraid," said she,&#xD;
ruefully.&#xD;
"Only point the path by virtue safely trod, I'm just the frisky&#xD;
chap to tread the glorious road."&#xD;
"I want to make-a barrel-chair."&#xD;
&#xD;
" ANh-a chair-of a barrel," waving his hand blandly at the cask,&#xD;
as if desiring it to change into a crimson fauteuil, easy and lux-&#xD;
urious.- "Just explain the first priiiciples-give a fellow a start."&#xD;
"'Why don't you see?  Saw off so much for a'seat, and stuff&#xD;
it; and round the corners, and bore holes for the tufting, and&#xD;
cover it, and bind it-"&#xD;
"Nuff sed, duck. Juniores ad laborers like me, (smiting his&#xD;
chest.)  Just count off the staves you wish to be rid of; I'll set&#xD;
to work directly, and what's more, I'll make a fancy job of it."&#xD;
Much delighted, he brought his own saga, sharp and keen, and&#xD;
sawed, and fitted, and modeled, and shaped with his powerful,&#xD;
flexible, fingers.&#xD;
"I ought to have my brown paper cap and my leather apron,&#xD;
Duck ; I should feel more .at .home. You hardly~ ever come to&#xD;
see me at the forge in my big apron, Ruthie."&#xD;
Ruth laughed and made no reply. She did not like to see him&#xD;
in such guise, and scarcely conscious of the feeling, she was&#xD;
proudest of him in his best clothes, she had such a natural lean-&#xD;
ing towards everything rich and handsome.&#xD;
Happily unconscious of her thoughts, George worked away,&#xD;
whistling a few soft notes from her cradle-song; and Ruth, after&#xD;
a few moments' not very profitable reflection, said, looking in-&#xD;
tently at the shining knife in his hand-:&#xD;
"George, how came you to be a blacksmith ?"&#xD;
"Well!" said he, pausing to brush away the shavings, and&#xD;
looking at her ; "now I call that odd. Here we have been jog-&#xD;
ging on side by side for nearly two years, and it has just entered&#xD;
your wise little head to question me."&#xD;
"You were always so reticent about your youth, I did not like&#xD;
to seemcurious."&#xD;
"Perhaps I have been. Well, it was not so very delightful,&#xD;
that's the truth; you see I was rich one day when the sun rose,&#xD;
and a beggar when. he went down. Would you love me better,&#xD;
duck, if I were something else ?"  He stooped and took her face&#xD;
into his two hands, and gazed down into her eyes, his broad fore-&#xD;
head a little clouded by what he read there.&#xD;

" You want me to say how proud I am of you, but your ruse&#xD;
won't do; I'm not going to feed your vanity. Don't answer my&#xD;
foolish question if you had rather not."}&#xD;
"It is a long tale, duck." -George roused -himself and put&#xD;
away resolutely his thought; "but you shall have it. I'll tell&#xD;
you to-night after the tea-fight, if you like."&#xD;
"Thank you, George ; come to breakfast now."&#xD;
He had put a last polish to his handiwork, and was .getting&#xD;
ready to leave her for the forge.&#xD;
"-Sweet duck, you are-fairly in for it, and I won't ,tease you;&#xD;
but don't work yourself sick to-day. I should deeply lament the&#xD;
necessity of putting on your tomb-stone, ' Here lies ,my faithful&#xD;
wife, ingloriously done to death by the first sewing-society'&#xD;
Ruth smiled absently. She was busily pondering ways and&#xD;
means.&#xD;
-" Oh, George, I've been thinking that it would be a good plan&#xD;
to take that money I laid away from Pauline Bradshaw's lessons,&#xD;
and buy a new.carpet. I don't believe I shall ever arrive at oie'&#xD;
in any other way, and our barn of a parlor is so cheerless."&#xD;
A little cloud settled upon the young husband's face. "Do&#xD;
you long for carpets, and such gear, Ruthie ? You are pretty,&#xD;
and sweet, and a good wife. You shall have everything you&#xD;
want one of these days ; but be patient -a while ; I must have&#xD;
time."&#xD;
Poor Ruth saw her mistake, and made haste to repair it. She&#xD;
brought her choicest wifely arts to bear, and succeeded in lifting&#xD;
the cloud; but after kissing her fondly, he went away without&#xD;
whistling his usual jolly measure, and timing his springing step&#xD;
to it. He was too deep in thought. " That rotary must work ;&#xD;
it must, and shall," he muttered.&#xD;
Ruth soon forgot her inadvertent little speech in her:absorbing&#xD;
employments. Pigeon awoke much ,earlier than usual, and 'had&#xD;
to be dressed. The morning was already half gone, and the&#xD;
chair not yet upholstered. Ruth began ,to feel discouraged. She&#xD;
sat down and took her pretty boy on -her lap; he missed his&#xD;
mother's usual devotion, and was fully alive to the suspicion!that-&#xD;
&#xD;
.she had a- plot to. set.. him aside,; of course he could not abide&#xD;
that peaceably; he certainly did not believe in sewing-societies,&#xD;
at least 'when they involved as a consequence the neglect of .ba-&#xD;
bies. Ruth' began .to feel as if it cost too much, even if' they&#xD;
clothed all the Irish children in the village. She was just say-&#xD;
ing to herself, with a weary sigh:&#xD;
"I wish Christabel Goldsmith would come and help me," when&#xD;
the door opened and she stood before her.&#xD;
"Thinking of angels you will hear the rustle of their wings."&#xD;
Her whimsical greeting did not cover an inquiringgaze into her&#xD;
favorite's face.&#xD;
-"Yes, Ruth," said Christabel, going up and kissing her, and&#xD;
answering to her unspoken thought; "oh yes, I feel better. It was&#xD;
good of you; that golden yesterday did me a, service. There's&#xD;
life in the world ; I shall'share it somehow ; I can't see the way&#xD;
out but I've got a hope; a hard thing to hold on to over there&#xD;
jerking her =head backward, but I'll try, Ruth. I've' had a new&#xD;
discipline, but it don't hurt as I should think it would."&#xD;
" What is it, dear ?" asked Ruth, anxiously.&#xD;
"Mother locked. the library this morning; and- took away the&#xD;
key. She says I shall not have that temptation to the awful sins&#xD;
of idleness and disobedience."&#xD;
'Her lip curled a little scornfully,,and she burst into a laugh.&#xD;
" Rainbow has had an escape, I must tell you about it."&#xD;
Soon the two were laughing heartily. The story lost nothing&#xD;
in, graphic force from Chris's telling:. "Not one of his nine lives&#xD;
touched," said she, "not one. Come here, little husband; say&#xD;
good morning to your faithful wife."&#xD;
Ruthsecretly thought she would deal somewhat with. the sour&#xD;
widow on the library question, and she was glad to see Chris take&#xD;
it so easily. They turned to the, pressing business of the day,&#xD;
and were soon plunged into the mysteries' of cake making. As it&#xD;
was to be a "tea fight," and the first. attempt, Ruth was partic-&#xD;
ularly anxious that everything should be of the nicest. Christa-&#xD;
bel tied Pigeon into his high chair and ,bestowed on him .a pile of&#xD;
egg-shells, which he found- infinite satisfaction in crushing in his&#xD;

little fists ; and the girl's face got more and more its happy, con-&#xD;
tented look, (she never could smile so at home,) her attitudes&#xD;
were free and graceful, her white arms well shaped and pretty;&#xD;
Pigeon patted then when she stooped over him, after tucking up&#xD;
her sleeves preparatory to beating the eggs. The delicate froth&#xD;
rose higher and higher, "and her face rose with it ;" she was beat-&#xD;
ing her vexations and discomforts into her labor.&#xD;
" Had you any dreams last night, dear ?" asked Ruth, glancing&#xD;
at Chris out of the corner of her eye.'&#xD;
Yes, waking dreams,"- replied she, smiling. "I thought a&#xD;
great many thoughts last night, Ruth. I planned my life ; that&#xD;
is, the life I could enjoy. I'm not going to tell it, though ; you&#xD;
would laugh at my folly. Look, Pigeon, at the sea-foam I am&#xD;
making ! Nay, nay, I said look; -no pretty fingers, if you please,&#xD;
little-greedy fellow."&#xD;
Ruth thought she could guess the tenor of her dreams, and&#xD;
what grave student figured there, but for once she was mistaken.&#xD;
Though Chris thought much of Otho, and remembered perfectly&#xD;
every one of his pungent utterances, every keen glance of his&#xD;
dark eyes, every trick of feature, he had no place in her plans,&#xD;
no part in her future. Independence, leisure, voyages, art-study,&#xD;
these were her dreams, but always companionless.&#xD;
"Butter the dish, dear; I'll have it in the oven now in a jiffy.&#xD;
I felt as if I could hardly afford (white sugar, but -I thought I .&#xD;
would for once ;  don't know but George will think me foolish."&#xD;
A little sigh escaped her, as she recalled her nal-apropos speech.&#xD;
"I have never invited. any"company ; I shouldn't think of doing&#xD;
so now, but as I had to have the fuss,and expense, I must con-&#xD;
fess to a natural leaning towards doing things genteelly."&#xD;
"How did your tongue prove ?"&#xD;
"My" tongue ?  A most unruly member'; it has made several&#xD;
slips already t ,is morning. The pickled one I got from the.Gone-&#xD;
cusset market'was-so remarkably Frenchy that I was glad to get it&#xD;
out of the house ; I hope it Won't poison the pigs. There is a half&#xD;
dollar lost. I do wish Deacon Williams would sharpen up his&#xD;
&#xD;
conscience to the edge that would compel him to=keep wholesome&#xD;
meats. I call it grinding the face of the poor, myself."&#xD;
(The Gonecussets had a market as well as a store for their&#xD;
workmen. Oh, they knew how to take it out of their bones and&#xD;
sinews.)&#xD;
" How lucky !"&#xD;
"I regret that I cannot view the matter in that pleasing aspect.&#xD;
It appears to me to be excessively annoying and' disagreeable."&#xD;
"I was not thinking of the loss of your tongne, dear. That&#xD;
would be a calamity deeply to be deplored by me if no one else,&#xD;
for it always comforts me ; nor of the wickedness of the Gone-&#xD;
cussets, but of a vast piece of corned beef which mother has got&#xD;
boiled in the pantry. I should like ever so much to be rid of it,&#xD;
for I foresee no end of hash before it is' consumed ; and. if there&#xD;
is a breakfast which I particularly detest it is hash; so I will just&#xD;
run home and beg of her to contribute it to the sewinglsociety."&#xD;
" Not for the world. The entertainment - is a private ' ventur,'&#xD;
and George would be horrified. He .says they that go borrowing&#xD;
go sorrowing. Once in the early stage of our.housekeeping, be-&#xD;
fore I had got the machinery well oiled, I got out of butter, and&#xD;
the dear old fellow bravely swallowed his bread in its pristine&#xD;
purity, though he does not need the yellow cowslip under his, chin&#xD;
to tell how he loves butter. No, no, my love; the good people&#xD;
must make out without the flesh-pots to-night."&#xD;
"I suppose, Ruthie, that you ladies will provide the supper&#xD;
when we meet at Mrs. Growing's. I heard Mrs. John Bisbee say&#xD;
she considered that the proper thing to do, and I assure 'you that&#xD;
Mrs. Growing smiled very approvingly upon the suggestion."&#xD;
"Of. course ; where would be the use of being minister's wife,&#xD;
if you didn't have the whole congregation to- fetch and cari-y for&#xD;
you' ? I don't know how they feel, because I have not been there,&#xD;
but I should think it would be much more conducive to self-re-&#xD;
spect and usefulness to have a good salary and live on it like&#xD;
other public servants, than to feel obliged to duck and bow for&#xD;
favors which ought to be rights; but they get used to it, I suppose.&#xD;

:.So merrily did they work, and so rapidly,,that Ruth had her&#xD;
Wish.- The chair was all completed, stuffed with hay, batted with&#xD;
cotton, bound with quality, and curtained around with chintz, and&#xD;
turned loose upon society, a tip-top chair, before two o'clock,&#xD;
without any recollections of a former state of existence to be&#xD;
embarrassing to itself or its friends.&#xD;
Punctually as the clock -struck three, Mrs.. Williams and&#xD;
irs. John Bisbee arrived. They had picked up Mrs. .Grow-&#xD;
ing on the way, and brought her along, though she made all sorts&#xD;
of excuses, and did not at all intend to come, They had .some&#xD;
bundles, and a roll of paper ; the latter the constitution of the&#xD;
embryo society, and the former clothing -for the poor, as Mrs.&#xD;
Williams wordily explained while she laid aside her wrappings.&#xD;
Mrs. Growing produced Freddy s cap, which she displayed with&#xD;
an air, saying: "My son would give ;his-cap;" she. did not think&#xD;
.it expedient to, add that he.so; much doubted this mother's veracity&#xD;
that he never rested till he saw it tied up and under way; and&#xD;
she waited-with it on her hand for the expected praises of his&#xD;
early benevolence. -.She had also laviishly brought a pair of sus-&#xD;
penders and a baby-apron. "I am    ntiost- ashamed really to&#xD;
bring these things, bit Ithought any little would help, and you&#xD;

won't expect much, from me,' because you, all know, ladies, how&#xD;
small Mr. Growing's salary is."&#xD;
She looked much the same as usual-washed out and uncer-&#xD;
tam, and did not in the least brighten till quite late in these after-&#xD;
noon, when the odor of the green tea, began to float about, and&#xD;
ten she roused up and gorged herself with the eatables.&#xD;
Mrs. Williams' donation was a yellow lace cap, trimmed with&#xD;
soiled white ribbon; an old beaver of the Deacon's, and, some&#xD;
hair-grease in an ancient cracked shaving-cup.&#xD;
" Beef's marrer," she explained ; "you know their hair generally&#xD;
sticks up as stiff as brussles on, a hog's back, and I kinder notioned&#xD;
that ef we got 'em into Sunday school, they'd look more respecta-&#xD;
ble ef they was licked down a little."&#xD;
Mrs. John Bisbee and Mrs. Esquire Hitchcock exchanged grins&#xD;
behind the portly lady's back, at these appropriate offerings on&#xD;
the shrine of benevolence, and unrolled their bundles of good&#xD;
solid factory cloth, and nice thick flannel, and spread them out&#xD;
with pardonable satisfaction..&#xD;
As Ruth's eye caught Christabel's, lighted up with fun, she&#xD;
could not help smiling, though she tried 'to pull on as demure a&#xD;
face as she could.-&#xD;
The ladies-now poured in rapidly, and the room was soon quite&#xD;
filled, and all talking together, insomuch that the parlor buzzed&#xD;
like a bee-hive in swarming-time. Some, settling of neighborhood&#xD;
affairs was of course necessary: the progress of whooping-cough&#xD;
and chicken-pox ; and they had a spirited debate upon the mooted&#xD;
question whether Dick Walsingham had the mumps or only an&#xD;
ulcer-tooth.&#xD;
Mrs. Deacon Williams then took her seat at the table,.'and&#xD;
rapped on it with her scissors, and spread out her silk dress with&#xD;
an important ait, and settled her stoutness, and called, in'her stri-&#xD;
dent vol'e, the attention of the ladies to the business of the&#xD;
meeting.&#xD;
"This here is the constitution,"-said she, laying her hand on&#xD;
the roll. "I've draped it up as Solomon .built the temple, that-.&#xD;
is I ordered it drawed, haI ha! and which I and Miss Hitchcock&#xD;

and Miss Bisbee and Miss Growing thinks it will do. I'll:read it.&#xD;
out loud; please to keep as still as you can; I've got the brown-&#xD;
creeters, and.my voice is rather hoarse. Them girls in the cor-&#xD;
ner especially; you can giggle all you're a mind to in the eve-&#xD;
ning, girls, when the fellars come."&#xD;
She looked around to make sure that the ,young ladies appre-&#xD;
ciated her delightful pleasantry.&#xD;
"The name of this society shall be the 'Scattergood Family.&#xD;
(We thought how't we'd have it family, so as to sound sociable;&#xD;
and as I told Mr. Growing, we are all .a band of brothers in the&#xD;
strong bonds of iniquity.)"  A suppressed audible smile in the&#xD;
corner.&#xD;
Then followed article first, second, and. so on; but as it was.&#xD;
written in crow's-track, sermon hand, and Mrs. Williams was not&#xD;
in full practice even in very plain chirography, she stumbled&#xD;
rather, made mince-meat of some words, and composed others;&#xD;
but she landed safely at the end at last, and nobody hurt, only&#xD;
the girls forestalled the giggle they were to keep till evening, and&#xD;
caused the good lady to glower indignantly at them through her&#xD;
gold eye-glasses.&#xD;
One article stated that each member should be required to&#xD;
pay six and a quarter cents admission fee.&#xD;
"The sum is ruther small on purpose, so that none on ,you&#xD;
shouldn't feel as if you couldn't afford it. Of course some on us&#xD;
wouldn't mind six dollars, but there was some of our men's wives&#xD;
that we wanted to have jine, and we didn't wish to hurt no per-&#xD;
son's feelings; and we thought mebbe each one had best bring&#xD;
any old clothes they, could spare, and hunt up, bits of silk and&#xD;
ribin and such, to make up into needle-books, and watch-pockets,&#xD;
and pin-balls, to-wards a fair. And we shall hef to work pretty&#xD;
-niddlin' smart to get it up, because we want to have a neat one.&#xD;
They had one amongst the stone church folks in Merry Bank last&#xD;
winter ; Miss Dr. Jenkins.was there, and she said they did dref-&#xD;
ful well, got enough to new cushion the seats all -over, and hang&#xD;
up a damask curtain behind the pulpit; and I'm sure it needed&#xD;
it bad enough, anyhow. My sister Jerusha lives there, she mar-&#xD;

ain't such a dreadfulisight of rich folks over there and they hairt&#xD;
got.no-faetories to send "em- ahead."&#xD;
Mrs. Hitchcock turned over a sixpence she was holdin in her&#xD;
mouth, intothe other cheek, and craned up and crossed her knees,&#xD;
and suggested that there should be-a committee appointed to' o'&#xD;
rond:te the stores, and- get silks and bits of ribbon, and  also to&#xD;
ask the-clerks for work, and invite them  to attend- aid" °M&#xD;
Dileet' Pettibone; the lean and elderly school-mistress spoke np&#xD;
and sdid-&#xD;
"I will volunteer to be one to go, if the other girls will acconi-&#xD;
pany me and propound the inquiries, and insinuate' the requests.&#xD;
1i amf so puffiely fastidious--that-1 should feel 'delicate about soli-c&#xD;

nifies: our aspirations, and ignites our enthusiasm. But I always&#xD;
constrain tnyself to bear the cross, and I am persuaded that the&#xD;
Zetetik is the oxny method practicable, and of course as young&#xD;
girls are the solicitors to obtain liberal donations, I'll promise to&#xD;
go.   She' finished' her speech with a" sweet smile and a youthful&#xD;
bridle.&#xD;
When you gazed into Dulcet Pettibone's eyes, you wondered&#xD;
that some good' fellow had not seen beauty enough in them to&#xD;
single her out for his own having, from the crowd, for they  ere&#xD;
well opened and agreeably expressed.; .but when you glanced&#xD;
dowr at her mouth, in size-and shape like a toad's, the wonder&#xD;
ceased. That Dulcet considered'herself'still in the market was&#xD;
evident from her multitudinous ringlets, and her airish ways, con-&#xD;
tortions of' body which western people call the "buffalo wriggle' ;"&#xD;
and old' Miss' Pettengill glowered' at 'her, (prancing across the&#xD;
room to I whisper in Ruth's ear,) "When you take notice what&#xD;
homely creturskthe 'men idl pick out, and parade off and get&#xD;
maried to, you needn't' wonder if' Dulcet catches somebody yet.&#xD;
If she don't it 'won't be for' want of tryin';" 'said she.' "The lay.&#xD;
sakes! how folks-can !";~r&#xD;
Mrs. Esquire Hitchcock suggested once more:&#xD;
&#xD;
",Don't it appear to you,.ladies, as if we had best buy some&#xD;

She then withdrew to, the.window to peer upatheastreet for the.&#xD;

"She wants office, I'll be bound," said old Miss Pettengill to,&#xD;
Mrs. John Bisbee. -" That's what she's arter; peculiar, I should&#xD;
say. Law, how folks can "&#xD;
Mrs. Goldsmith's advice was put in force ; and though Mrs.&#xD;
Deacon Williams had achieved the presidency she coveted, she&#xD;
looked somewhat- glum at little Mistress Ruth, seeing that a prop-&#xD;
osition should have found favor which emanated from so small'a&#xD;
rill, instead of rising from herself, the fountain-head. Everybody&#xD;
had brought their thimbles, and as Mrs. Goldsmith set immedi-&#xD;
ately to work in her new office of first directness, and cut away&#xD;
slashingly, after her manner, all fingers were soon employed; and&#xD;
the talk was broken up into couples and triplets among those who&#xD;
happened to be neighbors.,&#xD;
The young element clustered together in one corner, and little&#xD;
suppressed giggles and 'chirping voices showed how merry they&#xD;
were. With young-girl sharpness they were keeping up a run-&#xD;
ning comment upon everything that was done and said 'among.&#xD;
their elders. Now I don't know how you may feel about it, but&#xD;
I must say I always love to linger near a bevy of young maids,,&#xD;
albeit they are still in the juicy period when Byron has accused&#xD;
them of smelling of bread and butter, and listen to their fresh&#xD;
voices, their chuckles and ripples, and blithesome gushes of merry&#xD;
laughter. About everything, apropos to nothing, nomatter how&#xD;
trivial the subject in hand, no matter how trifling the remarks&#xD;
upon it, the:laughter rings out as clearly, and falls as- pleasantly&#xD;
as rain-drops on a fountain.&#xD;
Among these village girls there were the usual contrasts in color--&#xD;
ing, in size,:in outline, but' all just now, at least, looked- happy&#xD;
and good-humored.&#xD;
&#xD;
Little Zoe Walsingham had eyes as dark as a star-lit sky,.hair&#xD;
as longhand shining-biack as a young Seneca squaw's, and, a.clear&#xD;
nut-brown skin, which had felt the free play .of that south :wind,&#xD;
the rapid companion of Orion's setting ;; and a vigorous, springy&#xD;
little figure, fitted to climbing the breezy=hills, and exploring the&#xD;
hidden ,shelters of her dearly-beloved. Roaring River. As she&#xD;
moved her pointed brown fingers pliantly and nimbly in the sew&#xD;
ing, her tongue was also in merry motion, her eyes. sparkled&#xD;
with mischievous} light, and: her white teeth showedlike bits of&#xD;
purest ivory between her red lips; and she laughed in notessas&#xD;
liquid as a bob-o'-link's song. Sabrina Bradshaw sat beside her:&#xD;
A face like clear marble, every feature fine-cut and perfect. and&#xD;
hair of that wondrous lustre and dark richness which looks like&#xD;
molasses candy half pulled ; it coiled about her head in rich&#xD;
braids, which suggested sunshine. I never saw such -eyes as&#xD;
hers. People called them black, but when you looked across&#xD;
them they had the liquid red of a. deep carnelian, shaded by&#xD;
lashes that lay a thick curling fringe on her cheek, when they&#xD;
dropped under your too earnest look.' She laughed in four or&#xD;
fivA notes, each rising higher than the last, and all soft, clear,&#xD;
tuneful, sweet. This .Sabrina was the daughter, of that Alice&#xD;
Craigenfells who in the game of cross-purposes played by those&#xD;
young people so willfully, had given her whole heart to Frederic&#xD;
Goldsmith, and her hand to excellent Peter Bradshaw, of firm,&#xD;
stable manhood, like a rock to lean upon; to whom she had al-&#xD;
ways been the one precious and priceless treasure, to be worked&#xD;
for. and sheltered and adorned. Her first-born son she called du-&#xD;
tifully., Peter, though the, secret wish to give him the beloved&#xD;
name of her early monarch,. lay unspoken at her' heart., t'&#xD;
when the little girl came, and Mr. Goldsmith strolled- over from&#xD;
Brookside, on that golden summer evening, to:.make his congrat.&#xD;
ulatory visit to his cherished neighbors, with the large friendship&#xD;
he so lavishly bestowed upon- all his boyhood's. friends, and; his&#xD;
little pet Alice in particular, =all unknowing the heartpang she&#xD;
covered so bravely from all the world ; he had a book in his 'hand,&#xD;

"Alice," said he, "let us give a name to the pretty youngling.&#xD;
What say you, Peter, may I choose it?  I believe it is getting to&#xD;
be a hobby of mine."&#xD;
"I like-Alice pretty well, myself, but Posey says she won't&#xD;
have that repeated:in the family."&#xD;
"I am sure you have thought one for us, Frederic," said Mrs.&#xD;
Bradshaw; " pray let' us hear it," a faint red dyed her :pale&#xD;
cheek, her thin fingers played nervously among the golden fringe&#xD;
of her cashmere. Pure-hearted woman, true and loyal wife, as&#xD;
she was, she had not in all these years learned to bear his pres-&#xD;
ence with steady heart-beats.&#xD;
"These are the lines," said he, "and this the name:&#xD;
"Sabrina, fair,&#xD;
Listen, where thou art sitting,&#xD;
Under the glassy,:cool, translucent wave,&#xD;
In twisted braids of lilies knitting&#xD;
The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair;&#xD;
Listen, for dear honor's sake,&#xD;
Goddess of the silver lake ;&#xD;
Listen and save.&#xD;
By all the nymphs that nightly dance&#xD;
Upon thy streams with wily glance,&#xD;
Rise ! rise, and heave thy rosy head&#xD;
From thy coral-paven bed;&#xD;
And bridle in-thy headlong wave,&#xD;
Till thou our summons answered have.&#xD;
Listen and save."&#xD;
Alice listened to the voice as in a dream, and honest, sturdy,&#xD;
steady Peter liking the sound of the flowing verses, and the sweet&#xD;
maiden-hood they praised; and besides, heartily admiring the-&#xD;
artist-gentleman, so unlike himself, nimbly agreed ; and the maid&#xD;
grew and flourished, and bore gracefully her name, " Sabrina,"&#xD;
and also the " amber-dropping hair."&#xD;
About five o'clock, Mary Ann; Williams made her appearance,&#xD;
accompanied by her school friend, Belle Brandon, and the little&#xD;
rustle their entrance occasioned, showed that Belle was an object&#xD;
&#xD;
WDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.         171&#xD;
&#xD;
of interest or curiosity. She was about sixteen, and a very beau-&#xD;
tiful blonde, and had already learned to make the most of her&#xD;
infantile plumpness, and charming:dimples. She knew full well&#xD;
the way to set them off with childish artlessness, and also how to&#xD;
ingratiate herself with people she believed could be useful to her.&#xD;
She was an orphan, dependent upon an uncle, who was educating&#xD;
her, as her aunt assured her, for a teacher; and Belle made faces&#xD;
behind her back, and vowed she'd see her further first. How-&#xD;
ever, the educational process was so far perfected as to iuake her&#xD;
perfectly'-au fait concerning the uses and value of money. She&#xD;
had learned to bow with becoming deference to the aristocracy'&#xD;
of wealth. It was one of the things upon which her aunt lav-&#xD;
ished her eloquence.&#xD;
" You must get a rich husband, Belle ; the older the better,&#xD;
and the sooner out of the way. I saw old Soapfut Silverpenny&#xD;
looking at you last night at the opera, (and mind you don't sit in&#xD;
the front of the box again, or you'll stay at home, uncle or no&#xD;
uncle.) I wish he would take you off my hands ; if you are not&#xD;
smart enough to manage an establishment for yourself, you must&#xD;
trot. I'll not be bothered by a great girl like you, hanging on&#xD;
and costing money."&#xD;
" Why Aunt Isadore ! You surely can't mean the old codger&#xD;
who used to peer down the area railings, when you made me sew&#xD;
in the basement with that. dreary Miss Thrifty, who sneezed so,&#xD;
and 'said she'd a ' rose cold id- her dose.' -He used to ogle me&#xD;
with one eye shut, and -say 'soap-fut ?' inquiringly, and when I&#xD;
shook my head he shook his, and said, 'no, ye's got none because&#xD;
ye's aits en.'"&#xD;
"The very same," replied Mrs. Brandon, laughing at Belle's&#xD;
odd grimaces. "He's a millionaire now ; has a palace on the&#xD;
avenue, and servants in livery, and would make you a capital&#xD;
husband, and I would come and superintend your receptions and&#xD;
breakfasts."&#xD;
"Thank you, aunt," Belle replied demurely. "ITll come out&#xD;
first; if you ,lease. I think I can secure a better parti than old&#xD;
Silverpenny; if I get the chance."  And she secretly thought,&#xD;
"I'll manage my affairs, too."&#xD;

Old Soapfut was invited to the house, and Belle was presented.&#xD;
to hii; but as he did not rise to the bait she was to have another&#xD;
year of schooling, as much to keep her out of the way as any-&#xD;
thing. She was. amazingly quick-witted and sharp under her&#xD;
gushimgness, and had picked up plenty of showy accomplishments,&#xD;
and much superficial knowledge at her fashionable schools, and&#xD;
he reeled it off glibly upon occasion, and had also gotten all the&#xD;
tricks and, habits which girls are morally certain to take on when&#xD;
they are huddled together, the bad with the good, like the wheat-&#xD;
field; and most rank and destructive are the tares fond parents-&#xD;
are forced -to reap oftentimes, and gather into, their harvest for&#xD;
the :ctop thus planted. She could throw billet-doux from her&#xD;
window with unerring aim, and counted it good fun to out-wit and&#xD;
evade her teachers, and flirt with young men .of, whom' she&#xD;
scarcely knew the names. She could say sarcastic things of&#xD;
school-mates less fortunate 'than herself, and enjoy their suf-&#xD;
ferings under the lash of her ridicule. . She could cut a friend&#xD;
without a conscious blush, if it happened to jump with her humor.&#xD;
It will be seen-that she needed little more finishing to come out&#xD;
an elegant woman of the world, fitted to adorn the politest circles;&#xD;
and she had besides quite a repertoire of foreign ternris of endear-&#xD;
ment, which were very telling in her hours of confidence. This&#xD;
was the first time she had been in the country, except a week or&#xD;
so at some watering-place in the long vacation, where her uncle&#xD;
insisted that she should be .of their party, and carried the point&#xD;
in'pite of his wife's unwillingness ; and she assumed a.good deal&#xD;
of' grandeur, and found much enjoyment in the eclat. her appear-&#xD;
ance created, and counted upon inspiring awe in the hearts of the&#xD;
young people with her airs and style. She had struck up an&#xD;
ardent friendship last term with her adored Mary Ann. A sad-&#xD;
eyed, subdued, nothing-in-particular girl was the adored, who had&#xD;
been much chastened during her tender years by her-loud, over-&#xD;
bearing:mother, whose system of training was pithy-and econom-&#xD;
ical-ta wo-d! and a blow, the blow :coming first,&#xD;
In sdma families the government is,. "'Come do this, darling,&#xD;
because it is right. because you. love me ;" but Mrs. Williams&#xD;
&#xD;
would none of this sort of discipline ; .hers could be heard and&#xD;
felt. it " sounded like applause," often, but it left a stinging be-&#xD;
hind&#xD;
As we were' saying, after having examined Miss Williams'&#xD;
wardrobe, and ascertained that her father was a.factory owner,&#xD;
kept a carriage, -and by skillful angling fished up all particulars&#xD;
she wanted, Belle Brandon immediately froze to her, entered her&#xD;
on her list of friends, and here she -was,spending the summer&#xD;
with the adored, who was a plastic tool in her hands, which man.&#xD;
'aged her skillfully as the ants do their aphides, and laughed at&#xD;
-her all the time. She hugely enjoyed -the constant struggle she&#xD;
saw in the Deacon's household,' between the desire to be magnifi.-&#xD;
cent and the inherent meanness of its portly mistress, whose won-&#xD;
drous constructions of the English tongue, and her browbeating&#xD;
management of her weazened little husband, tickled her sense ,of&#xD;
'humor ; all such enjoyments she covered under a bland, outside,&#xD;
and the Deacon's wife was in the habit of considering her a good-&#xD;
ish sort of .a' young person, rather simple, but desperately at-&#xD;
tached to Mary Ann.&#xD;
. Meanwhile, she has stepped gracefully across Ruth's parlor,&#xD;
threading her way between the chairs without seeing anybody,.&#xD;
and dropped into 'a -seat with - an air of studied indifference.&#xD;
Childishness .not being her role this afternoon, she was a trifle&#xD;
supercilious in her replies to the polite remarks offered by those&#xD;
near her ; .and -she carelessly scanned their. dress and:personalities.&#xD;
'She evidently intended carrying the- Millville people by storm,&#xD;

set down your names to the constitution, and pay in your sixpence,&#xD;
or you won't be allowed to stay and see the fellers in the eve-&#xD;
ning."&#xD;
Miss Brandon rose "in graceful haste," and smiled, showing off&#xD;
her blue eyes and dimples, as though - the joke were of the&#xD;
choicest&#xD;
" She knows what she's about, I'll be bound ; 'tain't to be sur-&#xD;
mised that she likes that talk, but law ! don't she .look peaches&#xD;
and creamy?" remarked old Miss Pettengill, that tiresome old&#xD;
maid, who was so absolutely left to herself on all social gather-,&#xD;
ings, as to have nothing -else to occupy her except to "keek into'&#xD;
either folk wi' nice and sly inspection."&#xD;
- Of course the first appearance of this showy young stranger&#xD;
formed a theme for animated discussion among the talkative cor-'&#xD;
ner-Cluster, who, by the way, were not in the least subdued by&#xD;
her graces.&#xD;
"Tit sure she looks rosy enough," said Susie Jenkins; "I1&#xD;
thought she was in, delicate health. They say she never steps&#xD;
her foot out of doors without putting on. her veil and her gloves:&#xD;
and she sleeps in paste for her complexion."&#xD;
"I think she is very handsome," remarked Sabrina, decidedly.&#xD;
"But how she hitches up her shoulders!" said Irene Bisbee.&#xD;
" Don't it look as if she did it on purpose ?"Y&#xD;
" Oh, ye poor benighted ones ! are ye not aware that that is&#xD;
the fashion?  Mrs. Williams says she has got.the true Grecian&#xD;
bender," spoke up Zoe Walsiugham.&#xD;
"I'm sure she is authority on the Greece question, but the&#xD;
kind she knows all about is spelled with an s."&#xD;
" Miss Zoe," said Miss Pettibone, "let me remind you to culti-&#xD;
vate repose of manner; you have exuberance of gesture, though&#xD;
all ae graceful. And do not criticise -too -severely those older&#xD;
than ourselves. Every one cannot be expected to be as pufficly&#xD;
-fastigious as we are who have been carefully educated. Our ex-&#xD;
cellent President was necessitated- by adverse circumstances to&#xD;
spend her early years in a vulgar round of occupations, aptly&#xD;

called 'grubbIng,' not a choice word, and one I should not reconi-&#xD;
mend you to employ, but very appropriate to this case; and she&#xD;
naturally finds it difficult to free herself from the trammels of&#xD;
habit, and mount with her rising fortunes. Consequentlysh&#xD;
continues to save odds and ends, and grasps after fragments as&#xD;
assiduously as the man witl the muck rake collected his rdic-&#xD;
ulous treasures, to whom Christian was introduced by Mr. Inter-&#xD;
preter. You remember what Diodorus Siculus says on the force&#xD;
of habit."&#xD;
"No, I don't," said Zoe, iknpatiently. "Do please, Miss Dul-&#xD;
cet, to leave out some of the big words this afternoon.. When&#xD;
we get a half holiday do let us feel as if-we had got one, and&#xD;
peace be unto those tiresome old wretches. . You always-seem&#xD;
ever so much older when you talk school-ma'ami."&#xD;
" Oh, Miss Dulcet," said Sabrina, quickly, "mama tied up a&#xD;
charming bouquet for you, and bade me bring it, and I forgot it.&#xD;
She says nobody appreciates her flowers so delicately as you;1&#xD;
think it is because you know all about them. Our botany class&#xD;
has been delightful."&#xD;
Miss Dulcet,.who had drawn up in rigid' silence, and with a&#xD;
very red face, smiled gratefully at Sabrina, and thanked her with&#xD;
much warmth.&#xD;
"Miss Dulcet," said Zoe, dropping down from her low chair on&#xD;
to her knees in front of the teacher, and clasping her, hands on&#xD;
her lap; "nay, you shall look at me ; that great brother of hers&#xD;
(pointing to Sabrina) has promised me a couple of Polish fowls,&#xD;
jet black with. white top-knots; I'm going to bring thera to your&#xD;
mother."               -&#xD;
She smiled one of her wicked, daring, bright smiles at Dulcet,&#xD;
which demanded forgiveness for her petulant flippancy, and was&#xD;
sure of getting it. The sharp-featured spinster bent over the&#xD;
piquant little beauty, and kiss d her pouting red lips with a half&#xD;
sigh after her own lost youth, which Zoe understood as well asif&#xD;
she had put it into words.&#xD;
"What dear, nice, slender 4hite hands you have, Miss Dulcet."&#xD;
She held her own brown digits beside the one she had seized. I&#xD;

"Miss Zoe,, you know I am pufficly fastidious on those topics,"&#xD;
murmured Miss Dulcet, bending over her work with a well-pleased&#xD;
snile; 'ard shejfervently hoped that Zoe might be found among&#xD;
the'prophets.a&#xD;
"Girls," shid Susie Jenkins, "we polished off Mrs. Williams&#xD;
handsomely,with Miss Dulcet's help, and v have still spare time&#xD;
before the 'tea equipage' enters. What do you think of Mrs.&#xD;
'owing as a text?"&#xD;
44There is not enough of her to talk about ; a character to afford&#xD;
ititeresting matter to commentators must have salient' points. If&#xD;
yott' had proposed her husband, the theme would be worthy; how&#xD;
he could ever tie himself up to "that piece of putty, I cannot im-&#xD;
agine," remarked Zoe'&#xD;
'Perhaps that was one of the matches spoiled in the transit&#xD;
rt in the celestial to the terrestrial," suggested Dulcet. "lave&#xD;
you never observed' that taciturn ladies choose garrulous gentle-&#xD;
men, and garrulous ladies admire taciturn gentlemen ?"&#xD;
"She had got that speech by heart, and had to fire, it off&#xD;
though it doesn't hit this case in the ,least," whispered Zoe to&#xD;
Sabrina, who shook her off impatiently, afraid Miss Dulcet might&#xD;
hear and  be-hurt.&#xD;
"«The fact'is patent," said that irrepressible, not in the .least of-&#xD;
fended bySabrina's snubbing, rather enjoying it, in truth. "The&#xD;

"What do you call stupid?" said Sabrina, looking at herewith&#xD;
an odd expre,-ion on her face.&#xD;
"I'm sure it is very plain English," replied Zoe, perversely.&#xD;
" Stupid, dull, common-place, tiresome, sluggish, uninteresting,&#xD;
red-cheeked; I can't abide red-cheeked men."&#xD;
" Very lucidly explained, thank you," replied Sabrina, haugh-&#xD;
tily&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Bradshaw," said Zoe, chuckling inwardly, "serves&#xD;
you right for trying to pump me."&#xD;
" Well, girls," remarked Susie Jenkins, "I think I should like&#xD;
best a husband who will pet and take care of me; brilliant intel-&#xD;
lect is all-very well, but kind ways and words are better. Ibshall&#xD;
be called ' duck,' as Ruth is."&#xD;
"Sensible to the last," spoke up positive Miss Bradshaw. "A&#xD;
husband who would be always talking about something' you can't&#xD;
understand, and. absorbed in matters too high for you to peep&#xD;
into, would be a horrible nuisance;' a poor girl so mated=stands a&#xD;

minding the children, while the brilliant intellect who owns her is&#xD;
abroad at book-clubs, or adorning the drawing-room of some wily&#xD;
creature who has nothing better to do than to entertain-him, and&#xD;
keep him away from home, where he ought to be ; and the poor&#xD;
wife, the working partner in the matrimonial firm, gets faded and&#xD;
pale, and hasn't much to say when she does venture into society;&#xD;
and the world looks on and exclaims, " Poor man! his wife is no&#xD;
society for him.' She has pern'iitted herself to fall back, and has&#xD;
degenerated into a mere domestic machine, while he, being one&#xD;
of the 'dominant minds,' has gone -onward and upward. And&#xD;
nobody looks for the cause ; nobody sees the poor woman, over-&#xD;
taxed, bending under a load of petty cares, all her powers con-&#xD;
suned in wearing household duties; which are as inspiriting as&#xD;

bondage."&#xD;
Good gracious, Sabrina, you are evidently spearing some-&#xD;
body ; 'impaneling. him with knives,' as Mrs. Williams said of&#xD;
the Chinese jugglers. - Who is the wretch ?"&#xD;
"That's my secret," replied Sabrina.&#xD;
"Well, I am safe in saying no 'dominant mind' will ever make&#xD;
a household drudge of you, dear Lady Disdain."&#xD;
I am quite sure of it," replied Sabrina, loftily.&#xD;
Ha! ha!" cackled old Miss Pettengid, "do hear the pullets&#xD;
crow-! Of course, my pretty dears, you'll each and every one of&#xD;
you carry off the husband you set up to get; just take your pick,&#xD;
snare 'em as they do partridges. I've heard pretty much that&#xD;
kind.of talk afore in my day; not §o hifalutin, but meant much&#xD;
the same; and I've lived to see the game played out, and the dif-&#xD;
fer:ence is curious. Girls air peculiar; hear 'em gabble about&#xD;
getting married.. Law, you'll live all on you your appointed time,&#xD;
if you don't get tacked on to anybody. Bless the pretty mop-&#xD;
pets1 they've mislaid their rag-babies, and are' wishing for hus-&#xD;
bands: He! he!",&#xD;
What do old women wish for? A cup of tea, or a nice bit&#xD;
of scandal, I suppose," said Zoe, flippantly, resenting her inter-&#xD;
ference.&#xD;
"As pert as a cockatoo, I declare for't. If you or Sabriny was&#xD;
to ask your ma's if they got the ones they wanted, what do you&#xD;
suppose they'd tell- you? I knowed 'em afore you was' born."&#xD;
With this parting shot, old Miss Pbttengill dotted over to Belle&#xD;
Brandon, who regarded her as a natural curiosity, and greeted&#xD;
the old creature's attempt to get talk out-of her with a supercili-&#xD;
ous stare.&#xD;
All this time Christabel Goldsmith sat apart from the other&#xD;
girls, with 'Pigeon' on her-lap, her eyes fixed on her mother, half-&#xD;
'bent;, diooping, forlorn. It was difficult to identify her with the&#xD;
animated, happy talker who had been so sparklig and joyous up&#xD;
at Craigenfells. The fact is, she had been looking shyly at the&#xD;
gay cluster in the corner-their pretty toilets, easy attitudes, and&#xD;
satisfied ways-and mentally comparing herself with them; and&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
the old bitterness had sunk deep into her soul, and the old: angry&#xD;
resentment was corroding like a sore at her heart.&#xD;
"Why is it that my mother, who certainly is .charitable, and&#xD;
can be loving, for she dotes on Chandos,.must be so hard to"me?&#xD;
I wonder if I am ,not a changling; there must be a reason for my&#xD;
being so out of place at home. Why won't she send me to school?&#xD;
She says I am silly and romantic and good for nothing; she never&#xD;
seems to like me to have any pleasure. She does not talk that&#xD;
way to Chandos, and he does nothing useful that I can.see ; he&#xD;
likes much the same occupations that I like ; she has no right to.&#xD;
make such a difference between us. If he would work part of&#xD;
the time, I could bear it better. I ought to. study; my father&#xD;
loved me to do it, and would never have tired of helping me on,&#xD;
but I must give it up. I thought I had, and here.I am, going all&#xD;
over it again."&#xD;
Two great tears coursed down her pale cheek, which had- a&#xD;
right to be round and rosy, and she bent her head over Pigeon,&#xD;
and sobbed, forgetting where she was, and who.might, be observ-&#xD;
ing her.&#xD;
The excellent, pious matron who shouldhave .been the first to&#xD;
see the great burden lying on the poor, crushed little heart, and&#xD;
the readiest.to lift it, (else what business had she to take on na-&#xD;
ternity,) never thought it worth while to watch the secret work.&#xD;
ings of the rarely gifted soul struggling to unfold under her dreary&#xD;
shadow, even if she had the capacity to do it. Poor Chris was&#xD;
forced through a round of daily tasks, whieli might have. been&#xD;
made pleasant to her with different overlooking, and afew inter-&#xD;
vals of kindly granted leisure .forthe occupations she loved. The&#xD;
all work and no play system took the life out of her, and she&#xD;
chafed under it, tormented by her conscience, if she did not openly&#xD;
rebel.&#xD;
Proper Mrs.,Goldsmith, all unconscious of her daughter's mus-&#xD;
ings, sat erect, nicely dressed, her straight line of mouth and&#xD;
sharp, black eyes as unlike as possible to the flexible, mobile fea-&#xD;
tures that made the father-look so harrowing to her sometimes.&#xD;
She believe in total: depravity of the stiffest kind, and looked&#xD;

'rdently'fotward to the real 'ire and brimstone which should&#xD;
swallow up all who dared to walk on any 'other crack but the one&#xD;
she had her feet on. Regarding in ,perplexed horror the day-&#xD;
dreams and artist {moods and= disrelish :for sewing-work of-the&#xD;
gifted ciid:as  something very like'crimes, she preached her creed&#xD;
in esoi and Out of season; and she might as well have tried&#xD;
hei hand at making a useful barn-fowl out of the purple and gold&#xD;
huhnmirigh-ird. She worked zealously 'to uproot the noxious&#xD;
weeds and to 'plant her hard thrift in its' room. As she could&#xD;
iever'make head-against 'her husband, who answered her preach-&#xD;
mentswith'a quibble,:and laughed' good-naturedly, even when she&#xD;
'made'her favorite declaration that the devil desired to have him&#xD;
and sift "him las wheat, and'= took his own way easily and quietly,&#xD;
as though shewere not, and carried his darling with him, she was&#xD;
fully and perhaps vindictively set now to bring her, as she said,&#xD;
"into the traces."&#xD;
The teamm of talk ran rapidly in Ruth's parlor. The barrel-&#xD;
Chair came in for plenty of comment, and Ruth was called on&#xD;
minutely to describe the process of manufacture, and each of the&#xD;
1ndies present had already secretly planned to duplicate it, and&#xD;
httd. in their mind's eye a cosy nook in their respective homes&#xD;
"which it might fill and adorn.&#xD;
Mrs. Williams soon tired of so much praise of a thing in which&#xD;
she had no part, and started a 'new topic. Throwing back her&#xD;
broad'cap-strings, she remarked in her loud, domineering voice:&#xD;
"SamRipley got home last night, but Guster died afore he&#xD;
fetched up. I should think he must have been dreadful mortified&#xD;
to get there' and ' find him dead. That is the way it is; we are&#xD;
cut up like the grass, and throwed into the oven., It'becomes us&#xD;
all" to say with the Psalmist, ' Behold, he shall make my feet like&#xD;
hen's feet, and make me- to walk upon mine high places, to the&#xD;
chief singer upon'my -stringed instrument,'"&#xD;
"Which Psalm is that, Mrs.,Williams? I should like to read&#xD;
the whole of it."&#xD;
-Luckily 'she didn't hear you," said Sabrina. "Zoe, you carry&#xD;
off the palm'for unblushing effrontery."&#xD;

. can't help touching the old lady up once in a while; she's&#xD;
always saving spiteful things -to me."&#xD;
Just then Sonsie Eagn,(who had arrived shortly before and&#xD;
taken up Ruth's service as if she had been born in it,) came,&#xD;
bearing some clean maple sticks to replenish the fire, and a great&#xD;
tortoise-shell cat bounded after her, brandishing his mottled&#xD;
tail, permowing and dodging in and out among the petticoats,&#xD;
till he singled Christabel in her corner, 'and then jumped&#xD;
fea lessly into her lap, and curled down beside Pigeon, (Who wel-&#xD;
cored him in rare glee,) and commenced washing his face with&#xD;
his left paw, being very particular about his ear'and whiskers.&#xD;
"Christabel!" called out Mrs. Goldsmith, who recognized the&#xD;
voice of her 'enemy, and frowned. "What did you let that nasty&#xD;
rep-tile come with you for ?"&#xD;
"I did not let him, mother. Rainbow goes wherever he likes.&#xD;
I did not know he intended to come here ; he never said so."&#xD;
Though Chris managed to speak up for her pet, she blushed to&#xD;
nher ears, under the raking fire of eyes which this reproof brought&#xD;
upon her.&#xD;
"Turn him out immejetly !" ordered the dame.&#xD;
"Oh my dear Mrs. Goldsmith," put in Ruth, coming to the&#xD;
rescue, "we all love Rainbow; he has more sense than half the&#xD;
folks. You see Pigeon is of my opinion; do see him kiss him!&#xD;
and how well the splendid fellow bears his pulling and squeezing,&#xD;
never offering to bite. - Rainbow, did you come to play with&#xD;
Pigeon ? well, you are -a, fine gentleman, and always welcome in&#xD;
good society."&#xD;
The girls all dropped their work,, and rose-up in a 'bevy like&#xD;
young partridges in a meadow, and flew and settled about Chris-&#xD;
tabel, and began to squeak and squeal, and exclaim in all the&#xD;
tones of the: scale, using 'all manner= of superlativesexpressive&#xD;
of .admirat'dn, and ,lavishing 'caresses ujoa the lordly monster,&#xD;
who received their attentions with autocratical politeness, and&#xD;

his Egyptian ancestor, which sparkled and snapped with electric&#xD;
fire. Rainbow's debut was, a decided hit; everybody laughed&#xD;
when he climbed away from his admirers,:and seating himself on&#xD;
Chris's neck, reached his paw around and patted her little ros&#xD;
ear, and kissed her cheek. - Mrs. Williams looked on sorely dis.&#xD;
pleased at the tableau of admiring attitudes that instantly routed&#xD;
itself, and observed:loudly-,&#xD;
" Cats is rather curious critters, that's a fact. I should say tha&#xD;
great Tommy looked more like a wild beast than he does like a&#xD;
cat. Did you know they eats grass ?"&#xD;
As this observation was launched at Dulcet, she replied :&#xD;
"1 scarcely think that ee;n be the case, madam. The fls do.&#xD;
mesticata is a carniverous animal, like its cousin the fells catus,&#xD;
or wild cat, which is sometimes said to be indigenous to Ireland.&#xD;
Maxwell, in his 'Wild Sports of the West,' has accounts of a&#xD;
savage breed of cats who did a great deal of mischief. and con-&#xD;
siders them the true fells catus. Our fells domesticata is sup.&#xD;
posed to be descended from the fells maniculata, which was do-f&#xD;
mesticated in the homes of the Egyptians, and also was embalmed&#xD;
by them. Our cats were imported into Greece and Rome, and&#xD;
thence into England, and were of course brought over in the&#xD;
Mayflower to our shores. I have no doubt myself that they par-&#xD;
took of the soup which was cooked in Miles Standish's dinner-&#xD;
pot, which is so choice an ornament of the historical collection."&#xD;
There is no telling where Dulcet, would have .stopped, so&#xD;
delighted was she with an opportunity of displaying heiknowl-&#xD;
edge, had not Mrs. Williams broken in upon her.&#xD;
Well, it ain't no sort of consequence where they sprung from.&#xD;
I don't count the whole bilin' of 'eni worth -a continental dog's&#xD;
tail, myself; I won't have 'em round my house. The young uns&#xD;
they fetch home a kitten once in a while, and beg to keep it, but&#xD;
they don't never grow very well, and I generally have lax kill&#xD;
'em; he just as soon do it as not.".&#xD;
The girls. exchanged indignant glances, and Zoe spoke up&#xD;
pertly:               i&#xD;
&#xD;
-WIDOW GOLDS)1TH'S DAUGHTER.             183&#xD;
" Why Mrs. Deacon Williams! I 'wonder you don't think of&#xD;
he wickedness of wasting so many cats; you are always talking&#xD;
about saving things."&#xD;
"How do you know but Rainbow is an Egyptian cat? Ie&#xD;
certainly is large enough. Would he not look nice stuffed, Chris-&#xD;
tabel ?" said Sabrina.&#xD;
Christabel fidgeted and hid her face on Pigeon, and pretended&#xD;
not to hear ; but Sabrina was determined, ands went on:&#xD;
"Unless you can prove to the contrary, I shall always consider&#xD;
him an Egyptian. I mean to put him into a mesmeric sleep and&#xD;
find out all about the pyramids, the next visit he makes Pauline."&#xD;
" Rainbow is more like a pampas cat," said Chris,,fighting her&#xD;
shyness, but still busying her hands among Pigeon's curls.&#xD;
"That is a new kind of cat; dear me, I had no idea there&#xD;
were so many."&#xD;
"Did you say pampered cat, Christabel ?" asked Zoe ; "because&#xD;
I think he not only looks it but is it. Dick and his two sweet-&#xD;
hearts make no end of fuss over him."&#xD;
"I said Pampas," answered Chris, " the people of Buenos Ayres&#xD;
call it gato pajero, because it lives in the reeds-and long grasses ;&#xD;
and the English residents term it 'jungle cat.' It is yellow and&#xD;
brown, like Rainbow, and indeed the picture resembles him&#xD;
closely."&#xD;
" Do they tame that race of cats ?"&#xD;
"I think not; they devour the birds and poultry, sometimes,&#xD;
but do not love humanity."&#xD;
"They are all the same kind, only some have never been&#xD;
tamed; a -cat is a cat, and nothing more," said Irene Bisbee.&#xD;
" There is one difference in their making up, which always re-&#xD;
mains a.difference, and proves that the races are distinct. The&#xD;
domestic cat will sometimes -run wild, and get savage, butt al-&#xD;
ways keeps its' long, slender, tapering tail, through ever so many&#xD;
generations; and the tail of the felis catus is always short and&#xD;
bushy."&#xD;
" Where did you find all that out, Christabel ?" asked Sabrina.&#xD;

"1 read it in St. John's 'Wild Sports,' and many amusing anec-&#xD;
dotes, also, about=hunting. It is a good book."&#xD;
"I must have it directly," spoke up Zoe.&#xD;
Mrs. Williams looked sourly at the group over her eye-glasses.&#xD;
She'was a::little-afraid of Zoe, but she crossed her stout legs so&#xD;
as to make a better lap for her sewing,.and waving her right foot&#xD;
in the air, 'she pursued her remarks, having no'idea, as she after-&#xD;
wards said to Belle, of beipg ' put down by a passel of giggling&#xD;
minxes."&#xD;
"Law, it's the easiest thing in the world for noodles to, laff,&#xD;
ain't it ?" she remarked in a stage aside to Mrs. Hitchcock.&#xD;
" Sometimes they -laff the wrong side 'of their mouth." Then&#xD;
turning to the young ladies, "That's right, girls, glad to hear you&#xD;
talk about something besides fellers, even if it ain't nothing but&#xD;
Tommys. You keep your eyes open and you'll know about lots&#xD;
of things after a while. I was allers. dreadful, noticeable about&#xD;
animals and such. When I wasn't knee-high to a grass-hopper I&#xD;
watched the sheep and pigs, and was to home amongst 'em. They&#xD;
say every dum critter knows what is good for 'em, and what'll&#xD;
pizen 'em ; but tain't so, for sheep eats ivy, and it kills 'em some-&#xD;
times. - What do you think of that, girls ?"&#xD;
"' I think they must be very silly sheep, not to know what is&#xD;
good for them."&#xD;
"Not a mite sillier than some girls I know of," retorted Mrs.&#xD;
Williams, sharply..&#xD;
"Don't look so at me, Mrs. Deacon Williams, please," said&#xD;
Zoe ; " I feel sufficiently quenched."-&#xD;
Dulcet came into the conversation just in time to dampen the&#xD;
flame of the irate lady's wrath, which wicked little Zoe delighted&#xD;
to kindle.&#xD;
"The ovis was always accounted an obtuse animal,' from time&#xD;
immemorial; but we have many curious anecdotes of their clever-&#xD;
ness, and indeed they display as strongly marked idiosyncrasies&#xD;
as individuals of the genus homo. For instance, I read of a lamb&#xD;
who could not endure solemn.. music, but delighted in dancing-&#xD;
tunes. It had the deepest detestation for 'God save the Queen.'&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
and would 'baa, baa,' to such an unlinited extent, that the musi-&#xD;
cian was forced to desist from playing it."&#xD;
Mrs. Williams changed legs, and yawned, and ostentatiously&#xD;
took out her watch and struck it, to show that it was a' repeater,&#xD;
ignoring the old clock in the corner, which was conscientiously&#xD;
ticking off the minutes,' with the fire-shine shooting red gleams&#xD;
through the little round eye, and lighting up the dark cell where&#xD;
the pendulum was fifty and one years before doomed'to perpetual&#xD;
imprisonment, like a "lifer " in his cell.&#xD;
"I expect Mrs. Deacon Williams wishes tea was ready,"' whis-&#xD;
pered Zoe, loud enough for her to hear ; a payment for the stage&#xD;
aside that matron had addressed to the Esquire's wife.&#xD;
She turned and sent a scorching glance upon the fun-lighted&#xD;
face of her sharp little tormentor,-"and she thought 'within herself&#xD;
how she would long ago have taken "the kink " out of her; and&#xD;
unconsciously looked at her own Mary Ann, who was sewing with&#xD;
a very quiet, sober face, in the immediate neighborhood of the&#xD;
handsome Belle.&#xD;
"That's 'the way to fetch 'em up, whip it out-of 'em." With this&#xD;
self compliment she addressed Mrs. John Bisbee,&#xD;
" How's Miss Mullicorn, to-day, Miss Bisbee? HDave you&#xD;
heerd ?"&#xD;
"Suffering terribly; Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Killall were both&#xD;
there this morning. They say her nerves are quite unstrung."&#xD;
"Nerves! there ain't no such thing as nerves. What nonsense'!&#xD;
finikin women get lazy and make up a fuss, and call it nerves.&#xD;
I don't care a tinker's darn for doctors, myself; I never make&#xD;
no use of 'em."'&#xD;
"And pray, madam, what designation would you employ to de-&#xD;
nominate the sOat of sensation?  I shall be delighted to hear you&#xD;
elucidate your ideas. I always encourage the;dialogistic 'method&#xD;
among my young 'pupils. I consider that it enlightens the tene-&#xD;
brousness.-- Even the Arbacus Pythagoricus is best acquired by&#xD;

"That is the multiplication table," said Chris,,so :tickled as .to&#xD;
forget herself.&#xD;
"What makes you think so ?" asked Zoe, turning.saucily upon&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"I don'tthink so, I know it," replied Chris, reddening.&#xD;
"Hugh,'" interrupted Sabrina; "Mrs. Williams is going to say&#xD;
something else. She swallowed down those big words with her&#xD;
eyes on Miss Dulcet, as if they were pills and she the doctor.; and&#xD;
it must be confessed that our excellent teacher has a great flow&#xD;
of language."&#xD;
"Well, Dulcet, I do stand to't, there ain't no use in nerves;&#xD;
the things we want is cords, and cords we've got-.no more, no&#xD;
less.-&#xD;
Ruth seeing Zoe's eyes. brimming with mischief, and fearing&#xD;
what she might say next, remarked, glancing out of the window:&#xD;
"It is almost time for crocus blooms; I see some of mine are&#xD;
peeping up their heads."&#xD;
Here Mrs. Williams was at home. What she did not know&#xD;
about flowers and their culture she considered not worth acquir-&#xD;
ing. She had a fine garden, with straight walks and well-kept&#xD;
beds, and she worked in it herself, and thoroughly enjoyed the&#xD;
labor. She had the rare skill which belongs to some females,&#xD;
aid which seems like magic; whatever .she planted lived; what,&#xD;
she sowedcame up and grew. Her beds were always well-stock-&#xD;
ed; she begged' everything she saw, of pretty or rare ; no enclos-&#xD;
ure- was safe from her for miles around. She would start out in&#xD;
her buggy on long pillaging excursions, and return .laden with&#xD;
spoils. She had a sly way of shaking out a few seeds into her&#xD;
palm, when the gardener's back was turned, and pinching off little&#xD;
slips from precious plants, and she chuckled hugely when she saw&#xD;
the fruits of her industry take root and send up green shoots, and&#xD;
unfold fair blooms. Such blossoms were- especially dear to her.&#xD;
"I got some new flowers up- at Craigenfells last fall; they are&#xD;
bu-tiful, but the old fruzzle-headed gardener was - so stingy I&#xD;
couldn't make him give, me but two. They've got pereni-um tops&#xD;
and bieni-um roots. I sot 'em out in the same plot with my wild&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMrITU s DAUGHTER.             187&#xD;
turnips that Bax dug out of Bradshaw's woods. They've got a&#xD;
curious blow onto 'em; the botonical name-of them I suppose I&#xD;
needn't tell you, Miss Dulcet, is Jack in the box."&#xD;
'Ihis time there was such an irrepressible tumult of mirth&#xD;
among the girls that the angry lady turned on them a withering&#xD;
glance, and got red in the face; but they all seemed engrossed&#xD;
with Pigeon and Rainbow in a group on the floor, and she was&#xD;
fain to swallow down her wrath, and resume her sewing.&#xD;
"We talk of having a Sunday school festival fourth of July,&#xD;
ladies," remarked Mrs. Bisbee. "Don't you think it is a good&#xD;
plan ?" (reaching over to borrow Dulcet's scissors.)&#xD;
"I don't, for one," spoke up the. Deacon's wife, before anybody&#xD;
else had a chance to speak. ."I don't never attend nor counte-&#xD;
nance none of them theoratical performances."&#xD;
"I dessay the girls would like the festible well enough," said&#xD;
Mrs. :Hitchcock.&#xD;
" Will you go, Chris, if they have a sociable ?" asked Sabrina.&#xD;
"No indeed," she answered, smiling a little; "it would be a&#xD;
stig'able to me ; I never go anywhere."&#xD;
4.I declare," said Zoe, " I consider that woman as good as a&#xD;
play. I hope she will come every time. I would not miss ,her&#xD;
for anything."&#xD;
It was getting too dark to see to sew, but none of the gentle-&#xD;
men had arrived except Mr. Growing, whose duty it plainly was&#xD;
to be everywhere and blandly encouraging everything and every-&#xD;
body, and, George, who hurried home from the forge as early as&#xD;
possible, to help his little wife through her tea fight. The repast&#xD;
was all prepared and set out on the dresser in. the kitchen; as&#xD;
there were too many to sit at table, Chris, after much urging,&#xD;
consented to help Ruth carry it around. --Mrs. Williams,;who had&#xD;
kept a watchful eye upon the proceedings, rose, when she thought&#xD;
they were about ready, and stalked majestically across the room,&#xD;
and with her face adjusted to solemnity, she laid an impressive&#xD;
hand on Ruth's arm, busy with pouring the fragrant tea.&#xD;
" Mrs. Blair, if you please, I think it best to do everything de-&#xD;
cently and in order. As president of this society, I consider it is&#xD;

my plainduty to invite Mr. Growing to have divine service be-&#xD;
fore you pass the supper."&#xD;
Ruth hurriedly set down her bright tea-,pot and stared, with&#xD;
perplexed gaze.&#xD;
":Say grace, I suppose you mean, madam," suggested George,&#xD;
who was at Ruth's ,elbow, putting lumps of sugar into the cups,&#xD;
inexpressibly tickled, but beaming upon the portly lady with Vhe&#xD;
blandest of looks ; "certainly, if you desire it."&#xD;
4"I don't see how we can look to have our labors sanctified un-&#xD;
less we act up to our lights."&#xD;
"Very true, Mrs. Williams, piously put, highly  commendable,"&#xD;
replied {George, politely. Then turning to Mr. Growing, who, if&#xD;
truth must be told, had been controlling his muscles with difficulty&#xD;
during this colloquy, but had -not succeeded in keeping the mirth&#xD;
out of his eyes, which would laugh in spite.of him: "You hear&#xD;
the request, brother Growing."&#xD;
Mrs. Williams, determined to be in it, rapped on the door-&#xD;
casing with the buck-horn carving-knife, and said "silence!" and&#xD;
then covered her eyes with her handkerchief, still grasping the&#xD;
murderous weapon with the other hand, as if she were an assist-&#xD;
ant priestess, about to slay the victim. Mrs. Hitchcock and Mrs.&#xD;
John Bisbee nodded at each other, and then shut their eyes and&#xD;
-mouths tight together ; and old Miss Pettengill- said "suttinly,"&#xD;
and frowned 'darkly upon Zoe Walsingham, before elevating her&#xD;
bandana.&#xD;
As soon as their orthodox scruples-were properly laid to rest,&#xD;
the ladies all spread out their handkerchiefs upon their knees, and&#xD;
waited;impatiently for the advent of the tempting good things&#xD;
they coould see heaping the dresser.&#xD;
"   able -dictu/ 'exclaimed Dulcet Pettibone, when Chris&#xD;

".I don't feel quite competent to reply to your remark, Miss&#xD;
Dulcet, but I will venture to say that I think these',cups:look as&#xD;
if they had been in the ark, and Noah and his wife had had their&#xD;
tea out of them," said Zoe.&#xD;
Chris, amused out of her shyness, leaned forward, and commu-&#xD;
nicated the information that they were lent to the hostess' by Mrs.&#xD;
Deacon Williams as a particular favor. The girls looked at each&#xD;
other and burst out laughing.&#xD;
" What upon airth air you having so much fun about over&#xD;
there ?" called out Mrs. Williams, in a loud voice intended to be&#xD;
jocose.&#xD;
" Oh, we are discussing earthen-ware," replied Zoe.; "moraliz-&#xD;
ing upon the fact that good-for-nothing 'old tea-cups are sure to&#xD;
last forever, and choice vases and etched glasses are the oies fated&#xD;
to be smashed. 'Youth's forward slips death soonest nips.' "&#xD;
"We are going to play at proverbs after supper, Mrs. Williams,&#xD;
and invite you respectfully to join us, mucko en el suelo poco en el&#xD;
cielo," said Sabrina' lifting one of thecups, and smiling at Chris.&#xD;
The young girl looked wistfully into her eyes.&#xD;
" The earth is very beautiful," she answered in a low voice,&#xD;
and half unconsciously. "'And God saw that:it was, good.' I&#xD;
could enjoy much here ;" and with her thoughts so set afloat by.&#xD;
Sabrina's proverb that she almost forgot where she was, she pass.&#xD;
ed mechanically on.&#xD;
" Sabrina," spoke up Zoe, "that it-a charming sentiment which&#xD;
you just now uttered. I. coincide fully ; that is, I suppose I do."&#xD;
Mrs. Deacon Williams had already tried so manybouts with.&#xD;
the fearless young element, who had'no respect whatever for:her&#xD;
house or her horses, that she thought it safe to tilt no more, and&#xD;
she turned and began to talk at Mrs. Growing about the'female&#xD;
prayer-meeting, which that reverend lady {never attended for fear&#xD;
she 'should be called upon to lead the devotions, and told her what&#xD;
fault was being found with her for her remissness, and, what other&#xD;
short-comings she could l5ring to mind, in a christian spirit of&#xD;
plainness which was truly edifying;&#xD;

Chris and her tea-tray had reached the sofa by the window,&#xD;
which Belle Brandon had chosen: as a convenient sitting to display&#xD;
her ample silk skirts, and also as a tower of observation, whence&#xD;
she could command the passers-by, anddetect the earliest arrivals&#xD;
of the beaux, through the shadows which were softly settling&#xD;
upon the March day.&#xD;
The:new comers at Craigenfells were already much talked&#xD;
about, and Bertha had .received visits from the Roaring River&#xD;
set, who made haste to call,, with the ready hospitality which they&#xD;
were accustomed to practice on their side of the' dividing water,&#xD;
and it was understood among them that the Groenveldts were to&#xD;
be Ruth's guests for the evening.&#xD;
Belle speculated much upon the brother, whom, (if he. answer-&#xD;
ed her expectations,) she intended immediately, and as a matter&#xD;
of course, to appropriate. "There is no doubt of my ability to.&#xD;
do it," she thought, " though- they say he is traveled, and learned&#xD;
and handsome, and cares nothing at all for young ladies. It wilL&#xD;
be fun to teach hiin to care  I shall have to have a lover for the&#xD;
summer at any rate. I am certainly the most distinguished look-&#xD;
ing girl in the room."  She glanced uneasily across at Sabrina&#xD;
Bradshaw, and even took piquant little Zoe into her mental bal-&#xD;
ance. Poor Chris here created a diversion in her thoughts, being&#xD;
awakened from her abstraction by the sound of her own name,&#xD;
and her tingling ears caught the tones of that wicked, thoughtless-&#xD;
young maid commenting on her appearance ; and she remembered&#xD;
for the first time that Ruth had sent her to bi-ush her hair, and'&#xD;
she had plunged into her beloved " Recollections" instead.. So&#xD;
absorbed and flurried had that young matron been with her prep-&#xD;
arations that she had forgotten Chris's dress till just before the&#xD;
ladies arrived.&#xD;
" There, dear, you must go now and get ready," she had said,&#xD;
"put on your satin, and the apron, you know."&#xD;
Just then Pigeon awoke and began to scream.&#xD;
",What shall 1 do?  I wish Sonsie Eagan would come."&#xD;
"I'll take him into your bed-room, Ruthie, a little while."&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOWGOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.               191&#xD;
"I am afraid you must, Chris ; set him on the bed, and put -up&#xD;
your hair nicely, and you can run home and dress in a few min-&#xD;
utes, you know."&#xD;
Presently Ruth came up. "Now then, Chris, run 'for your&#xD;
life; your mother has just come."&#xD;
" She has locked up the place, then, and it will be of no use&#xD;
to go."&#xD;
"Ask-her for the key, of course. Come here,. my boy, see your&#xD;
scarlet dress."&#xD;
Chris dreaded to obey, and made up her lips to entreat Ruth to&#xD;
get it for her,; but ashamed of her cowardice, she went slowly&#xD;
down stairs, and sidling awkwardly across the room to her moth-&#xD;
er's chair, she preferred her request in a very timid voice.&#xD;
She got a peremptory "no " for reply. "I ain't agoin' to run&#xD;
the resk of havin' all the doors and gates left open, and all the&#xD;
pigs and cows in the neighborhood swarmin' in, and rootin' up my&#xD;
things. YQU was drefful' possessed to get over here, now stay.as&#xD;
you be. Set deoun in the corner there, do!"&#xD;
Whenk Ruth came in soon after, with Pigeon in her arms, rosy&#xD;
and sweet, he reached out for Chris to take him, and his mother&#xD;
resigned him, without giving a thought to her friend's appearance&#xD;
in her stress of anxieties.&#xD;
"For mercy sake, girls," (this was what Chris heard,) "look&#xD;
at the show that is going around the room. Hark ! the dogs&#xD;
should bark, for the beggars have come to town; that is, the rags&#xD;
and shags, the velvet gowns still linger. Why don't that girl&#xD;
button up her dressaand do up that mop of hair in a christian&#xD;
way ; it looks as if the. rats had nested in it before they were&#xD;
wanted for coachmen. I would either curl it decently, or I would&#xD;
cut it off, and my head with it.; I would, so."&#xD;
" Hush, Zoe'!" said 'Sabrina, angrily, coloring up red, in sym-&#xD;
pathy with the crimson shame which flushed our Chris's cheeks.&#xD;
The poor girl heard you; rude, unkind, unfeeling ! Let me tell&#xD;
you, she has got piles of learning stowed in that head which you&#xD;
ridicule,'that you never dreamed of, nor~ever will! . For my part&#xD;
I admire her; I never passed' a half hour in her company in my&#xD;

life, when, she would talk to me, that. I did not. learn something&#xD;
worth knowing, and feel my own deficiency and inferior acquire-&#xD;
ments, and resolve to make more of my time. I shall hasten and&#xD;
offer to help her carry that heavy tray, to. show that I have no&#xD;
part in your ill nature."&#xD;
"Good for Sabrina, the fair," laughed Zoe, merrily. "It is&#xD;
really worth while to have you for a friend, you take up the&#xD;
cudgels with such heartiness; I shall from this time cultivate you&#xD;
assiduously."&#xD;
Poor Christabel heard the attack but not the defence, and she&#xD;
turned a hurried and alarmed glance upon her mother, who was&#xD;
looking holy daggers at her* And though Sabrina, rose hastily,&#xD;
and approached her, she was not i time to avert .the catastrophe,&#xD;
for in her confusion she, stumbled over a footstool, and pitched&#xD;
forward -blindly, and away went the tray, tea-cups and tea-into&#xD;
the elegant folds of shining sills so gracefully disposed ,to receive&#xD;
them, and down went Chris amongst the ruins.&#xD;
Belle Brandon sprang to her feet, forgetting all her, town-bred'&#xD;
airs of nonchalant grace, and in a good hearty rage that there-was&#xD;
no mistaking, she exclaimed:&#xD;
"Stupid.! Can't you stand up, What on earth are you dream-&#xD;
ing of? . You have ruined my dress, careless animal! I wish you&#xD;
was in Jericho among the rams-horns and broken pitchers, with&#xD;
your horrid old tea-cups !"&#xD;
Just at this inopportune moment, when Belle was shakig~g off&#xD;
thedebris, andshowering the, tea upon the fallen figure, which she&#xD;
regarded with blazing eyes, the door openedgd.admitted the two&#xD;
people she had been watching for, and busying her thoughts over,&#xD;
and for whom she had arranged a .pretty programme of bright&#xD;
speeches and winning smiles ; and in the instant that followed,&#xD;
she swiftly -calculated her chances of missing her entre to the&#xD;
Craigenfells by her ill-humor.&#xD;
The tall brother sprang forward at once to. Chris's.rescue, and&#xD;
assisted her to rise.&#xD;
"'How did thishappen ?" he asked,,with a face of the utmost&#xD;
concern. *" You were ill; you have cut your face," he added, in so-&#xD;
&#xD;
low 'a voice that no one but Chris heard; the words. .:You are&#xD;
very pale, Sappho ; don't faint, I shall have to carry you in my&#xD;
arms, ifs you do."&#xD;
Just the ghost of a smile played about his mouth, and lighted&#xD;
his grave eyes, when she tried to jerk herself away from him.&#xD;
"Letme go, Mr. Groenveldt,, if you are merciful. My self-&#xD;
love has got a horrible blow, otherwise I am not in the least&#xD;
hurt. I wish I had broken my neck, and turned the lowcomedy&#xD;
into high tragedy for these grinning spectators. Pray. let me go&#xD;
and hide myself."&#xD;
Springing tears blotted out the composure she was struggling&#xD;
for, and she flew rather than ran through the kitchen, into Rgth's&#xD;
pantry, and 'threw herself upon the floor in the corner, SQ boiling,&#xD;
over with mortification and anger that she felt only surprise Mhep&#xD;
she noticd4d blood-drops trickling down her face, dropping upon&#xD;
her sleeve, and realized. the fact that she had: got a 'woud ,pon&#xD;
her forehead.&#xD;
- Miss Brandon's face was a study.* It was like magic ,the way-&#xD;
she smoothed the sourness- out of it, and arrayed it in radiant&#xD;
smiles, bringing all her dimples into action. -Ruth came forward&#xD;
with a sympathizing face and a towel, offering-condolences and&#xD;
apologies, and Sonsie Eagan gathered :together the debrisupon&#xD;
the tray, and puffed out her cheeks and looked fitto, burst J4,irer&#xD;

covertly studied Mr. Groenveldt, vainly-trying to dsoveo how&#xD;

Mrs. Williams meanwhile had risen from, her chair, up in&#xD;

"I shall expect you to pay for them are cups, Miss Blair ; they&#xD;
was air-loombs, handed down from' remote posterity, and real&#xD;
Chinese chany. I bought 'em at Abiathy Askew's auction ; he&#xD;
disported 'em himself by ,asea cappen. All his things was nice;&#xD;
I wouldn't have took nothin' for 'em."&#xD;
Everybody listened in surprise, while she harangued thus right&#xD;
eloquent, and the little hostess, catching her husband's eyes brim.&#xD;
ning with suppressed fun, while he softly clapped his thumb-nails&#xD;
in infinitesimal applause, laughed heartily in spite of all her well-&#xD;
bred struggles to the contrary, which was a signal for the girls to&#xD;
strike up, and everybody caught the infection. Sonsie, standing with&#xD;
her head thrown back, and her arms akimbo, led the laugh in her&#xD;
corner, with an earnest enjoyment which was irresistible. Even&#xD;
Mr. Growing had his share behind his hand, where his wife could&#xD;
not see him; and old Miss Pettengill st-ruck up a malicious cackle&#xD;
that was raspingly aggravating. Ruth made the best haste she&#xD;
could to smooth down her features, and assured Mrs. Williams&#xD;
that the breakage should certainly be made good as far as possi-&#xD;
ble  and that irate lady sat down muttering her favorite remark&#xD;
about "giggling mixess" and -bit the rest of her indignation into&#xD;
her biscuits and butter.&#xD;
The little fracas over, Belle procured the desired introduction&#xD;
to Otho. and exerted herself to be entertaining. She was piquant,&#xD;
artless, and gaily talkative, and the grave student looked down at&#xD;
her in curious amusement, as if she had been a pretty, animated&#xD;
toy. His eyes wandered often in the direction of Chris's flight,&#xD;
and when Miss Brandon had finished her supper, he politely took&#xD;
a: ay her plate, carrying it. into the kitchen. In answer to Ruth's&#xD;
smiling gesture, he opened the door and peeped into the young&#xD;
miiaid's retreat. She was-crouching in the corner, with her face&#xD;
in her hards, and at first wonld not raise it to look at her visitor.&#xD;
ke found a way, however, to bring her to terms; she could not&#xD;
long bear his half-teazing, half-comforting talk, and did finally&#xD;
look up with Rcrimson cheeks, and troubled, angry eyes.&#xD;
- Chris mourning-for the tea-cups, and refusing to be comforted&#xD;
because they are not," said he, with a whimsical smile. "Will&#xD;
&#xD;
rnot your life-course be something erratic if you dart off thus in a&#xD;
tangent at every little mishap ?"&#xD;
"I ought to be thankful to be able to afford entertainment," she&#xD;
spoke up hotly. " They had a gay time at my expense; I heard&#xD;
then laughing, and I wished they-would choke over it. I should&#xD;
like to know what I was born for."&#xD;
" Should you, Sappho ?" replied Otho, in a tone of amused&#xD;
banter. " I think I have found out that secret. When you dwelt&#xD;
in Lesbos you lived to write lyric pieces, elegies, and hymns ; the&#xD;
Lesbians placed your image on their coins as that of a divinity ;&#xD;
but the Lesbians were old fogies. If you will come out of this&#xD;
place now, like --a good child, and promise to reward me well&#xD;
hereafter, I will some day reveal to you the mystery and object&#xD;
of your existence. You must be obedient and tractable, how-&#xD;
ever; the first step is to come out of this."&#xD;
"But I cannot come out; I could not face those. laughers--it&#xD;
is just impossible ; I shall not try it. I shall dwell here among&#xD;
Ruth's pickles and preserves."  She looked up at the rows of&#xD;
pots and jars on the shelves above her.&#xD;
" Will you not be reasonable, and take my arm, and walk out&#xD;
with me,?&#xD;
"Certainly not ; I have reasons plenty as blackberries for stop..&#xD;
ping where ,I am, and cannot think of one which would induce&#xD;
me to show my face among those selfish people. I shall tarry by&#xD;
the stuff."&#xD;
She-heartily wished that he would take himself off and shut'the.&#xD;
door, and leave her alone ; very likely she showed her thought in&#xD;
her face, for as she moved impatiently, he said:.'&#xD;
"I think it is my plain duty to seek out Ruth and apprise her&#xD;
of the dangerous neighbor her jam-pots have ; but no-I can do&#xD;
better. Here are entering four young men, fresh from the bar-&#xD;
ber's, their lovely curls parted down the middle, and their dress.&#xD;
coats in spotless perfection; -suppose I were to walk up to Mr.&#xD;
Blair and ask him to resolve them into a committee to come and&#xD;
fetch you."&#xD;

" But you would note do - so: unheard-of a thing ; it would be&#xD;
simply shocking."&#xD;
"Just try ine,-then; If you are not out of this charming re-&#xD;
treat in:three minutes, I will beckon our host and make the re-&#xD;
questf; you know him well enough to understand how nimbly he&#xD;
will jump at 'the suggestion, arid, how good fun he will count it."&#xD;
Ile took out hiswatch and, regarded it attentively. "One rmin-&#xD;
ute gone.!. Miss Christabel. This, little trial will be an experi-&#xD;
enee for you; you will hereafter be able to form a slight idea of&#xD;
the feelings of a. condemned prisoner who' awaits his execution;&#xD;
a minute-and-a;half! how rapid is the flight of time ! we take no,&#xD;
note-of it but by its loss."&#xD;
She darted an eye-beam at him, wondering if he meant what&#xD;
he said, or were only laughing at her ; he, certainly looked very&#xD;
much in earnest; his face grave andquiet, his down-cast eyes in--&#xD;
tently- fixed on the, repeater-which lay in his open palm. Chris&#xD;
began to fidget and feel afraid of him. She sprang up hurriedly.'&#xD;
"I'm .going,. Mr. Groenveldt," said she; "let me pass please."&#xD;
"Not in such mad haste," he' replied,, calmly. replacing his&#xD;
watch ; "we have'still a half 'minute to spare, and will go togeth-&#xD;
er."  Then changing his manner, he added, kindly, "Your face&#xD;
is' bleeding,'dear Chris; the red drops have dyed 'your cheek with.&#xD;
bright incarnadine; come, take my arm, I will convoy you safely&#xD;
to the stair-case, which luckily is a short journey, and behind the&#xD;
crowd, who are busy with Ruth's tea."&#xD;
He kept his word and dismissed the shame-faced girl, who so&#xD;
foolishly dreaded the gauntlet of eyes, at the door, saying with&#xD;
decision, but also with the 'greatest courtesy:&#xD;
"'I shall' expect' you immediately, and' shall remain here till&#xD;
you descend," and kept his eyes upon her face, and his hold upon.&#xD;
her hand,:till she gavethe required promise...&#xD;
When she descended,: the girls gathered around her, and told,&#xD;
her 'about Mrs.,Williams, andsaid what fun it was ; and Miss Zoe&#xD;
cid herbest to make:upforher thoughtlessness, butChris could,&#xD;
not look at her, and Sabrina sat down by her and took her hand.&#xD;
She was comforted, and quiet, and she glanced from time to time&#xD;
&#xD;
gratefully at Otho, :but she could not unlock :her tongue because&#xD;
they wished it.&#xD;
All the young gentlemen -were by this time arrived. - Peter&#xD;
Bradshaw came up to Zoe Walsiugham, as if she were a magnet,&#xD;
'and she commenced her favorite amusement of teasing, and per-&#xD;
plexing him. John Hauxhurst, a noble honest fellow, writer at&#xD;
the foundry, and a great friend of George Blair's, -and -Irene&#xD;
Bisbee's brother, and the clerks from Starbird '&amp;amp; Iedlow's' came,&#xD;
and the girls were all wide awake and unconsciously looking-their&#xD;
prettiest. Dulcet Pettibone had particular reason to be satisfied,&#xD;
for Capt. Slocum drew his chair up to her, and gallently com-&#xD;
menced a conversation. He being a rich old bachelor, and worth&#xD;
angling for, though he was a little rough at times;and indulged in&#xD;
hard words, not always admitted into ladies society, she bit her&#xD;
lips to make themred,-and sparkled up her eyes, and all her little&#xD;
curls quivered, she was so lively and animated. Pauline Brad-&#xD;
sbaw and Gracie Jenkins, who had, up -to this time, been amus-&#xD;
ing themselves with Pigeon's mechanical playthings and puzzles,&#xD;
of which his father manufactured untold numbers, (popping jacks,&#xD;
dancing puppies, walking dolls, building:blocks; and dissected pie-.&#xD;
tures,) now came sidling in, hand in hand, in'search of new amuse-&#xD;
inent. They had tasted of everything Ruth had for ,supper, and&#xD;
-had tomato figs, and candied calamus, and had popped corn -on&#xD;
the shovel, and cracked walnuts besides.&#xD;
Dulcet, thinking it would be a telling thing to do, drew Pauline&#xD;
up to her, and seated her-on her lap, saying:&#xD;
"=I love little girls, Pauline! Won't you come and live with&#xD;
me ? I shall want somebody to take care of me when I am on&#xD;
old woman."&#xD;
Pauline who had no fancy. for promiscuous petting, glanced&#xD;
sharply up in her thin face, and replied concisely:&#xD;
"You are an old woman now."&#xD;
Poor Dulcet, deeply chagrined, pushed her quickly off her lap,&#xD;
and-said in a faint.voice:&#xD;
"-Go child," and she secretly resolved to keep as far fromt&#xD;
l'enfant'terrible in future, as -Ciroumnstan c, 'wowld"&#xD;

"Why, you awful child I" whispered Zoe, "how could you be so&#xD;
unmerciful to poor Miss Dulcet, when she was sweet on you ?"&#xD;
"hBecause. I was not going to stop on her knees, and listen to&#xD;
Usher dry cackle."&#xD;
But there was another arrow in r*- ;rve for the spinster. Cap-&#xD;
tam Slocum asked her what she w,  going to do with all that&#xD;
trimming .she was weaving, and offered to patronize her, by buy-&#xD;
ing some to trim his clothes, and she did not hear him, so busy&#xD;
was she in wondering what he thought of Pauline's 'speech, and&#xD;
if she seemed old to him, and old Miss Pettingill called out to&#xD;
her :.&#xD;
I would take something for my deafness if I was you, 'Dulcet'&#xD;
uPettibone, it grows on you."&#xD;
She found a friend where she least expected one, for Pauline&#xD;
walked up, and set her feet apart, and crossed her hands irl front&#xD;
of the taileress, and said:&#xD;
"I know of some folks who'will shiver and shake for fear,&#xD;
when Miss Dulcet dies of old age."&#xD;
I must shake you! you little wretch," exclaimed Zoe, under&#xD;
her breath, exulting over her, " You knocked the old lady flat&#xD;
that time. Where did you learn that nice speech ?"&#xD;
I heard Aunt Melinda say so to Uncle Jethro," replied Pau-&#xD;
ine composedly, "when he told her she had crows-feet; and she&#xD;
did'nt have either, for I got right directly down, and looked to&#xD;
see, and her feet were just like everybody's, only bigger, but&#xD;
was'nt she hopping mad at Uncle Jethro, though ?"&#xD;
For a' time Belle Brandon sat apart, making sly remarks to&#xD;
Mary 'Williams upon- the. assembled company, more for her&#xD;
own amusement, than the adored's, however, for she listened with&#xD;
a stolid unappreciative face, but when George: Blair assembled&#xD;
the young element in the kitchen for a game of steamboat, he&#xD;
came up and asked her to join them. She looked in astonishment&#xD;
at the handsome giant, who stood before her with his grand, sim-&#xD;
ple air, and clear truthful eyes, his easy fitting suit of black, and&#xD;
;his white handkerchief inhis well shaped hand, and listened to&#xD;
his request, framed in queer, nirth-provoking words: she could&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMiITH'S DAUGHTER..199&#xD;
not believe -that this was the journeyman blacksmith, so slighting-&#xD;
ly mentioned in the Williams .family. She glanced from him to&#xD;
Ruth who happened to be looking at them, and rose instantly and&#xD;
with an eager erpresse manner; and walked away with him.' She&#xD;
ot a seat in the circle next him, and opposite to Otho, who had&#xD;
Chris. by his side. - Bertha had found her exact niche among the&#xD;
Roaring River girls, and fitted it as well as if her infancy had been&#xD;
cradled in the mad music of the rushing water. Dulcet Vetti-&#xD;
bone maneuvered for a seat next Captain Slocum, and got placedl&#xD;
to her liking, (we don't all accomplish that, more's the pity,) but&#xD;
her success and her pleased wriggle gained for her a spiteful sniff&#xD;
from old Miss Pettingill, (who seemed to watch her narrowly,) and&#xD;
a stinging allusion to "fishing and pushing," which wound up in&#xD;
" how folks can." Belle Brandon opened her armory of bland-&#xD;
ishments ; whether the fact that the magnificent giant at her 'side&#xD;
was already appropriated, made him an object of especial interest&#xD;
to her, or that h massive beauty, and cheerful, cordial easy ways&#xD;
plea sed her, I cannot say, but at any rate, 'she lavished beaming&#xD;
looks and pretty talk on him unsparingly. George listened and&#xD;
answered, and laughed enough to satisfy and -inspire her, and they&#xD;
chatted so merrily, that Ruth looked on in astonishment. He was&#xD;
playing with a bracelet, which he held as forfeit judge. Belle&#xD;
extended her arm to take it from him; their eyes rested on each&#xD;
other, both faces animated and glowing; be caught her little.soft&#xD;
velvety hand,' and held it an, instant. She did not then withdraw&#xD;
it, but he put it gently away, and could not avoid seeing that her&#xD;
arm, from which her lace sleeve fell back, was round and creamy&#xD;
white and beautiful, and he freighted the steamboat with " Belle&#xD;
Brandons," laughing into her eyes as he did it, and she did not&#xD;
resent the liberty. You see George had taken the tea-fight into&#xD;
his own hands, and was carrying it off gaily and gallantly. His&#xD;
lively nonsense and odd jokes were inexhaustible, and the Roar-&#xD;
ing Riverites aided and abetted him; they were always delighted&#xD;
when he would join their frolics. They had a proverb, "to the&#xD;
brave belong the fair," and Peter got Zoe Walsingham for his&#xD;
prize, and Dulcet hoped that Captain*'Slocum would get' her but&#xD;

fate crossed her wishes, and bestowed her upon Jasper Bisbee-&#xD;
John Hauxhurst thought of Sabrina Bradshaw, who had been talk-&#xD;
ing with him, and had old Miss Pettengill, who indignantly re-&#xD;
fusedto come forward. ."'I ain't a playen," said she, "one old&#xD;
maid in the ring is enough," and George got BelleBrandon, who,.&#xD;
being instructed in her duty, rose with pliant glace, and knelt at&#xD;
his f etin a touching attitude, to receive from his hand her charge,&#xD;
and hei badge of service.'&#xD;
"Ho will you'like being my shadow," asked Otho of Chris,&#xD;
who had fallen into line at his side. "I shall do some tremendous&#xD;
feats, which will put your strength and temper to proof."&#xD;
"tam not afraid, sir. You know you are to be trusted, and&#xD;
will not subject my faith to too rude an ordeal."&#xD;
Ii'the novl gymnastics which followed, Belle Brandon shone&#xD;
unrivalled. Nothing could surpass the lightness and grace of her&#xD;
movements, and she -kept her blue eyes fixed upon her Caudillo&#xD;
with'the melting gaze a Circassian slave might give her lord. In-&#xD;
deed; the game took a new character in her management, and&#xD;
the other players left off to watch her, and when ordered to dance&#xD;
"iiola," she put a climax to the surprise by accepting the&#xD;
clothes-pins which her Caudillo offered her for castenets, and going&#xD;
through tlhegraceful steps with the springing grace of 'an Anda-&#xD;

"Why, Belle, I never saw you do anything like that before.&#xD;
I thought you despised te play games."&#xD;
"Cela depnd," replied Belle cooly.&#xD;
B"lut'where did you learn those figure-dances."&#xD;
"Atdaicing'school of course. I did not suppose I should ever&#xD;

with her tea-fight, making it a perfect success. She ought to have&#xD;
been very proud of him, and a happy little wife. Yet for some&#xD;
reason, there was a cloud upon her face, and instead of joining&#xD;
the games as was her usual pleasure, she hung back among the&#xD;
matrons, who had not nearly finished talking up the parish.&#xD;
Mrs. Growing feeling obliged to .go home directly after supper,&#xD;
her husband accompanied her, though he looked wistfully out -at&#xD;
the gay group in the kitchen, as if he would have liked better to&#xD;
tarry and enjoy the music of their fresh young voices, than tosit&#xD;
up in the disorderly nursery, and rock to sleepthe last baby ; a&#xD;
task which was sure to be in reserve for him there. But his&#xD;
helpmeet had no idea of leaving him behind her, and frowned&#xD;
virtuously upon George's invitation to him to return.&#xD;
The departure was the signal for a particular attack upon them.&#xD;
Mrs. Growing's method, or rather want of method, in man-&#xD;
aging her household, and the financial affairs of the family ;&#xD;
their borrowing propensities, etc., came in foray severe handling.&#xD;
The whole illustrated and embellished by such little personal&#xD;
anecdotes as had been collected by the 'good ladies since their&#xD;
last assembling together.&#xD;
" Did you see the new silk basque Mrs. Growing wore last&#xD;
Sunday?   It had on lace half a yard deep, and satin piping, as&#xD;
rich and trimmy as could be," said Mrs. Hitchcock. Adelezy&#xD;
Euphemy sot right behind her, and the price ticket was'nt cut&#xD;
off, and she tried all sermon time to make out what it cost. She&#xD;
said there was a b and a g, and a queer thing that looked kinder&#xD;
iike a hen coop atween them, and three figures. She asked her pa,&#xD;
but he laffed at her, and said, Gonecusset prices was all he could&#xD;
keep track on, but it cost enough, I'll be bound."&#xD;
" I do not adequately comprehend how she can reconcile it with&#xD;
the responsibilities of her position as Pastor's wife, to indulge in&#xD;
eextravagance, when there are so many worthy objects ofbenefaction.&#xD;
The government of her family does not surprise me, because all&#xD;
persons have not the gift to command morigeration. If I should&#xD;
ever marry a Pastor, I should think it my duty to appear only&#xD;
in plain apparel, and chaste subdued colors, not that I ever think&#xD;

&#xD;
of such a thing, or indeed about getting married at all. I don't&#xD;
intend to be in a hurry, yet awhile," said Dulcet Pettibone, who&#xD;
bad skipped airily in, and placed herself behind Ruth's chair in&#xD;
a graceful attitude, which-she hoped was telling upon the Captain,&#xD;
who she felt ought to be looking at her through the open door.&#xD;
" Humph ! peculiar," muttered old Miss Pettengill, "such airs!&#xD;
you.are so dreffulfjuvendle, I wonder 'you condescend to come, in&#xD;
here amongst the old folks. You must feel out of your elements."&#xD;
"Thank-you, dear Miss Pettengill, not while I keep out of&#xD;
your neighborhood. Do let me arrange your front for you, it is&#xD;
displaced to such a degree that it affords more than a glimpse of&#xD;
what you design it to hide. I I am sent-in by the judges, who are&#xD;
selecting a proverb for me to guess."  Just then the Captain came&#xD;
up and gallantly offered his arm.&#xD;
" We have been speaking about our dear Mr. Growing, Cap-&#xD;
tain Slocum. I was remarking that I am pufficly fastigious in&#xD;
sermons, and I consider his.as meat for strong men. Pray. give&#xD;
us your opinion. I do admire so much your characteristic, sensi-&#xD;
ble remarks, so original."&#xD;
"They've got a live man, but they begin to talk about shipping&#xD;
him off. .Then he's a natural builder, ma'am, just as much as a&#xD;
beaver ? No sir, he ain't going to be ousted, not if I have ,to pile&#xD;
up my subscription. When I hear the gospel dispensed with, I&#xD;
like to get the worth of my investment. He works like a horse,&#xD;
keeping a German class for'the young folks, and a debating soci-&#xD;
ety, and a book club. I was'nt edicated too high myself, but I&#xD;
like edication in others, and I know a scholar when I see one,&#xD;
and I tell you Parson Growing is a scholar, and if there is any&#xD;
religion, he's got the real stuff."  With this emphatic declaration,&#xD;
he wheeled about like a corporal on parade-made a jack knife&#xD;
bow-offered his arm, sticking out his elbQw,-smiting his breast&#xD;
with a flourish as he did it, and Miss Dulcet smiled blandly upon&#xD;
old Miss Pettengill, as she ambled away.&#xD;
" Well I must say," grumbled that forlorn, unfortunate female,&#xD;
"How folks can !"&#xD;
"-Perhaps you are not aware, ladies," explained Mrs. John&#xD;
&#xD;
WiDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.            203&#xD;
I sbee, "that Mrs. Growing has an income of her 'own, and so per.&#xD;
haps, she thinks she has a right to dress to her liking."&#xD;
" Well, I'd put it into the family, instead of on to my lack, if&#xD;
I was her,".said Mrs. Esquire Hitchcock. "I heard tell that they&#xD;
was so put to't, that they hadn't nothing to eat for a whole week&#xD;
but Injun meal and beans."&#xD;
" Is Mr. Growing's salary punctually paid ?" asked Mrs. Jen-&#xD;
kins, who, sitting by Ruth, had been an amused listener to the&#xD;
talk.&#xD;
Everybody looked at Mrs. Deacon Williams, who was supposed'&#xD;
to be posted in church matters.&#xD;
"Putty middlin, but they're so pesky shiftless about things,&#xD;
they don't know nothin how to make the most of what they get.&#xD;
No kind of cacalation, nor contrivance. If they had'nt but nine-&#xD;
pence in the house, and that there Freddy cried for, candy, though&#xD;
I don't spose he ever does, for he's a drefful old young one, but if&#xD;
he did, they'd spend the whole ont. You can't do nothin with&#xD;
such folks."&#xD;
Old Miss Pettengill cut in here, and pitched her voice so sharp&#xD;
that they bad to stop talking and listen to her.&#xD;
" Our minister don't seem to think he has many pastural duties&#xD;
to perform. He has'nt darkened my doors for mor'n a year. I&#xD;
sent Martha ; you know I'm fetchin up Martha, (here she dropped&#xD;
her voice suddenly into the lower register, where it grumbled and&#xD;
rumbled in unexpected and astounding complications) my sister&#xD;
Wilderkin's girl ; her father got smashed all to bits in the new&#xD;
fangled horse reaper, up at Peter Bradshaw's last harvest.. I was&#xD;
drefful lonesome in the old 'homestead after Ma died, ,and: sister&#xD;
Semanthy went out a missionary. I ain't sixteen no more. I&#xD;
ain't' ashamed to say I'm getting old,4/though some I could mention-&#xD;
are timorsome when ages is mentioned. So I took Martha tofetch&#xD;
up, and she's a lot of company for me. I was fryin up a lot of&#xD;
nutcakes, and I got some on em kinder brownand I told.Ma'rtha&#xD;
she might carry em up to the minister's, they had such a:lot of&#xD;
children, they'd soon tuck em out of sight. I kinder wanted to&#xD;
know how they did manage, I'd heard such queer things about&#xD;

em, and I told her she might stay to dinner if they asked her;&#xD;
but they did'nt, and as for the nutcakes, they did'nt hardly thank&#xD;
her for them, and the girl took em out intothe kitchen, and I dar&#xD;
say, that was the last they 'seen on em. ,I ha( to laff though, for&#xD;
Martha said, there Mr. Growing sot, a feedin the baby, and she&#xD;
was playin on the music. Should'nt you call that peculiar ?"&#xD;
"I don't think much of men's baby-tending," said Mrs. John&#xD;
Bisbee, laughing. "I get John up once in a while, in the night,&#xD;
but he. stumbles over all the chairs and knocks things down so,.&#xD;
and swears about them, so low that he thinks I don't hear'it, that&#xD;
I am thankful enough to get him back into bed again. He thinks&#xD;
he is a wonderful nurse'though, and I must say, the children dote&#xD;
on him.""&#xD;
The -ladies felt that Mrs. Bisbee was wandering from the sub.&#xD;
ject, and kept to the Growings. They coincided in opinion that&#xD;
the Pastor might do a great deal more if he tried; and as for his&#xD;
poor wife, she came in for severe handling. It appeared that&#xD;
there were numberless duties which she neglected, and a legion&#xD;
of things which she did, which were altogether out of character,&#xD;
and before they abandoned the topic, it was pretty clearly settled&#xD;
that she was proud, haughty, idle, selfish, foolish, vain, ignorant,&#xD;
extravagant, poor housekeeper, doting mother,. no kind of a wife&#xD;
for a minister in any particular. Poor lady! how her sallow ears&#xD;
must have burned ; if there is any truth in the popular belief, as&#xD;
she sat before her "parlor grand" that evening. -.Whether&#xD;
she deserved all she got, I cannot say, but one thing is certain,&#xD;
the people did not like her, and unless-a pastor's wife is accepta-&#xD;
ble to the parish, he may as well have an imperative duty call in&#xD;
some other locality, for he works against time and tide, Mrs.&#xD;
Growing had no particular sense of duty, was not learned in hu-&#xD;
man nature, knew little of books, though she took the Ledger and&#xD;
read all the poetry and stories in it. Her thoughts seldom strayed&#xD;
beyond. the narrow bounds of her own affairs, but if she did her&#xD;
home duties well, was not that enough to ask of a young mother&#xD;
with five little children in her nursery ? The ladies complained&#xD;
that she took pleasure in embroidering their small garments, and&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW   GOLDsMITH's DAUGhITER.          2o&#xD;
practiced a great deal on the Steinway which her father gave her,&#xD;
and curled her hair, and looked out of the window, and in short,&#xD;
did pretty much as she might have done if she had been Mrs.&#xD;
Esquire .Smith, instead of wife to a Parson. George Blair, who&#xD;
was -out by this time with Belle Brandon on his arm, laughed at&#xD;
the earnest matrons, and said:&#xD;
"Well ladies, I suppose Mr. Growing married his wife for him-&#xD;
self, and not for his congregation, and if. he is satisfied with his&#xD;
bargain, I don't see why they should kick up a fuss about her.&#xD;
Don't you say so, Miss Brandon. You intend to be the light of&#xD;
the eyes, to some good fellow one of these days, don't you ?"&#xD;
Miss Belle tossed off her curls, and smiled gushingly up&#xD;
into his face, and clasped her fair hands over his stalwart arm, as&#xD;
if content to rest there. She did not seem conscious of little&#xD;
Ruth's presence, though she saw her all the while looking at&#xD;
them, and with a pang of unrest in her secret soul. Curiously&#xD;
enough the laugh died upon George's lips, when he saw Otho&#xD;
come in and go behind Ruth's chair, and whisper in her ear. She&#xD;
rose and walked to the window with him, and the two talked to-&#xD;
gether earnestly for a few moments. Whatever George's thought&#xD;
was, however, he put it away from him, and returned to the young&#xD;
people, with his eyes as clear and his face as unclouded as ever.&#xD;
Everything must have an ending, and Ruth's tea-fight broke&#xD;
up at last, not before she was heartily weary. Everybody was&#xD;
delighted ; four of the clerks came up in a body, and told her&#xD;
that the society was better than a full dress party, and they in-&#xD;
t(nded to buy no end of pin-balls and pen-wipers"to encourage the&#xD;
young ladies. Belle Brandon, after she had tied her sea-foam&#xD;
picturesquely over her' curls, went up to her hostess, with both&#xD;
hands extended, and exclaimed impulsively:&#xD;
- "I've had the most delightful time, Mrs. Blair. I hope you&#xD;
will let me come here often ;s I think you are so sweet. I shall&#xD;
be in love with Millville from this very evening."  And she was&#xD;
so sincere and so nauch in earnest that her blue eyes were full of&#xD;
tears, and the rising bloom on her cheek n".de her aswinsome as&#xD;
a rose-bud.&#xD;

" Chris," whispered Ruth, when the last were going, "you are&#xD;
to stop all night; I have your mother's consent."&#xD;
"Is the milleniun about to commence ?" exclaimed Chris, in&#xD;
utter astonishment. "What did she say? flow I should like to&#xD;
have seen her face when you propounded the audacious request.&#xD;
I am sure it must have been a study."&#xD;
"Never you mind, dear ; the fact is absolute ; and you are to&#xD;
sleep with Bertha, and George has promised to tell us how he&#xD;
came to be a blacksmith."&#xD;
"Oh, that will be gorgeous! What a friend you are, Ruth."&#xD;
While she stood with her arm around Ruth's neck, and her&#xD;
wistful eyes fixed on her friendly face, Otho, who was to ride&#xD;
'I'ramp back to Craigenfells, came and said, quietly: -&#xD;
"Miss Chris, I want you; Mistress Blair has got to martha&#xD;
about, now, and keep her house, and I beg you to come with me."&#xD;
He led her into the parlor, where the cheerful wood fire had&#xD;
burned itself into clear coals, and certainly looked pleasant now&#xD;
that it was "curtained, and closed and warm," and opened Ruth's&#xD;
piano, a real cabinet Pleyel,-which she had inherited from her&#xD;
mother."&#xD;
"Now listen, Sappho," said he, " I have been taking liberties&#xD;
with your verses."-&#xD;
He sang the trifle she had thrown off in her happy mood up at&#xD;
Craigenfells, to a.sweet, riant air, with rich voice, and marvelous-&#xD;
expression.&#xD;
" Well, tenth muse," -said he, waiting for Chris to.speak, after&#xD;
the last chord had ceased to vibrate'; "how do you like our joint&#xD;
production ?".&#xD;
He smiled significantly, when he noted that the great brown&#xD;
eyes were full of unshed tears, and her flexible lips were trem-&#xD;
bling.&#xD;
"I cannot tell you," she replied in a low voice. "It is both a&#xD;
pleasure and a pain; I wasso happy that day."&#xD;
"Good;" he caressed his curling- moustache with grave satis-&#xD;
faction. " Now you are about to play a duet with me."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, I cannot, I cannot, indeed," she shrank away hurriedly.&#xD;
"You play so well."&#xD;
"Of course .I play well; I studied to that end in Germany,&#xD;
and I hope I" have not wasted my time. It is an odd reason-to&#xD;
give for declining to play with me:; you surely would not enjoy&#xD;
a' duet with a bad performer."&#xD;
" I like perfection, but I haven't got it. No, Mr. Groenveldt,&#xD;
please don't insist; I shall fail miserably; I cannot."&#xD;
"You said you could not leave Ruth's pantry, yet you have&#xD;
passed some pleasant moments in her kitchen since that positive&#xD;
assertion. Come, here is a bit of Hernani; you shall take the&#xD;
primo; I am not constitutionally fond of playing second fiddle,&#xD;
but I shall benevolently permit you to be first soprano."&#xD;
She made no further objection, and -let him seat her on the&#xD;
music-stool, talking the while such gay nonsense as no one else&#xD;
ever heard him utter, and placing himself at her side, they com-&#xD;
menced. At first Chris's trembling fingers went astray among&#xD;
the keys, and her color fled and came in crimson gusts; but by&#xD;
the time they had turned the first page she- forgot everything in&#xD;
the glad triumph the harmony awoke in her soul, and Otho stud-&#xD;
ied her wrapt face, with the flicker of a smile playing about his&#xD;
short upper lip, as with dilated nostril and flashing eyes she&#xD;
dashed throughthe triumphant finale.&#xD;
" There !" she exclaimed, dropping her hands into her lap;&#xD;
"thank heaven, I have not forgotten; it has made me so unhappy&#xD;
sometimes."&#xD;
"2I felt sure you could play well, Sappho; I knew it intuitively.&#xD;
May Iask who taught you ?"&#xD;
" Papa," she replied, proudly.  "Dearest' papa taught me&#xD;
everything; that is, I mean; everything I know."&#xD;
" Come out of that, you two, we are to have a story; my&#xD;
George is clearing his throat now in preparation," said Ruth, put-&#xD;
ting her laughing face, from which the clouds were all lifted, in at&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
"The best laid schemes of mice and men&#xD;
Gan, aft agley."&#xD;

&#xD;
Ruth did not get her story, because before the players had had&#xD;
time to leave the piano, there came a soft "rat-a-tat-tat" at the&#xD;
piazza door, and Belle Brandon walked in, with a slender bamboo&#xD;
rod and a lantern in her hand. She had her silken skirts tucked&#xD;
up so as to show her neat Polish boots, and on her head a round&#xD;
cap of blue velvet, over which was tied her long sea-foam, like a&#xD;
white cloud, the ends of which were thrown picturesquely back&#xD;
over her shoulder. She was all gushingness and dimples asshe&#xD;
clasped her staff with rosy-tipped fingers, and struck a Rosalind&#xD;
attitude. Mary Ann Williams, who followed her, was as white&#xD;
as a ghost, and scared out of her wits. Constitutionally a cow-&#xD;
ard, besides being full of hobgoblin beliefs, nobody but her bosom&#xD;
friend could have persuaded her to cross the old covered bridge&#xD;
over Roaring River, full of little whirlwinds and startling echoes,&#xD;
so late at night. Belle laughed merrily at their amazed faces.&#xD;
"Here we are, on the last edge of the evening, like fringe upon&#xD;
a petticoat," said she. " I've lost my bracelet, and I could not&#xD;
persuade myself to go to sleep till I had hunted it ; so we stole&#xD;
out at the back door; Auntie thinks we are safe in bed, and I&#xD;
have poked my lantern every step of the way, but haven't seen,&#xD;
it.. I would have looked. more faithfully on the bridge, but my&#xD;
Mary Ann got a fright and ran for her life."&#xD;
"You mewed like ever so many kittens on purpose to scare ne&#xD;
to death," retorted Mary Ann, sullenly. " It was enough to make&#xD;
anybody wamble-cropped to hear the awful story you kept, on,&#xD;
telling all the way ; and there was a peddler murdered on-that&#xD;
bridge once, too, and here it is near twelve o'clock."&#xD;
"You here, Mr. Groenveldt !" interrupted Belle, with a dra-&#xD;
matic start, as Otho came out of the parlor; "I supposed you&#xD;
had galloped over the hills and far away long ago."&#xD;
"I am about to take leave, Miss Brandon,". he replied, quietly,&#xD;
and with grave eyes. He had already bade good-night toChrista-&#xD;
bel, and after kissing Bertha he went out. George followed him&#xD;
on to the piazza, pulled his sleeve and; whispered to him. Oho&#xD;
answered with a shrug and a head-:hake:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
" Not in this bright moonlight; that young ladylis fully capa-&#xD;
ble oftaking .her own part. She must excuse. me; too much&#xD;
honor," and springing upon Tramp he galloped away and in a few&#xD;
minutes was -clattering over Peddler's Bridge.&#xD;
When George returned he saw Ruth looking out ,at the win-&#xD;
dow after the horseman. She had iot observed Belle's scrutiniz-&#xD;
ing study of her, nor the shade of impatience which crossed ier&#xD;
face when Otho so coolly replied to her greeting. She however&#xD;
did see the beautiful blonde walk up to her husband as soon as he&#xD;
came in.&#xD;
" Come, now, Mr. Blair, and help me look ; you've got such&#xD;
big eyes, I'm sure nothing will dare to hide from them which you&#xD;
wish to find out."&#xD;
As she entered the parlor she cast a swift glance upon the sofa,&#xD;
but she searched up and down everywhere before she approached&#xD;
it. George was busily poking about also, and, she chattered no end&#xD;
of cunning nonsense to him the while.&#xD;
"Non est inventus. You see, Miss Brandon, our-parlor holds&#xD;
not the jewel, for which I am very sorry; but don't spoil your&#xD;
bright eyes about it ; such an arm needs no braceletss"&#xD;
"Oh you little wretch! here you are," she exclaimed, flying to&#xD;
the. sofa and pulling the turquoise circlet from the fold in the cor-&#xD;
ner, where it lay nice and straight as if carefully placed in hiding.&#xD;
"See, Mr. Blair ! is it not worth seeking ? I think my arm will&#xD;
look no worse with it on."&#xD;
George of course took it from her hand and accepted her invi-&#xD;
tation to clasp it around her creamy wrist.&#xD;
" I am so glad'; now I wish we had some wings, I and my&#xD;
Mary Ann; would they not become her ?" she pointed laughingly&#xD;
at her friend, whose face was still chalky white. "I don't think&#xD;
we shall meet the peddler, dear ; if we do, I am sure we can out-&#xD;
run him if you use your feet as you did when we came. Such a&#xD;
figure as you were!"  She looked so merry and so charming over&#xD;
the recollection that Bertha laughed heartily, 'and Chris fell to&#xD;
studying her face as she would have done a picture.&#xD;
"I cannot suffer you to return alone," said George.&#xD;

&#xD;
"That's very nice of you. Don't be surprised, Mrs. Blair, if&#xD;
he never comes back any more. I've always thought I should&#xD;
like to run off with somebody."&#xD;
While George was putting on his cap and coat, she sat down&#xD;
to the piano and sang such a tender, bewitching ballad as held&#xD;
them all charmed, and Ruth's eyes filled with tears. But when&#xD;
she came up and bade good-night, the moving grace of her air,&#xD;
and the beaming looks she bestowed upon George, filled the little&#xD;
wife with anger, and she was vexed with herself for the feeling.&#xD;
What else could he do ?  Here were these two girls, half a mile&#xD;
from home at midnight. She tried her best to be reasonable, and&#xD;
when Chris and Bertha had retired she sat down before the fire&#xD;
and waited, and the time seemed very long, and her face was all&#xD;
clouded over again, and when at last he did come, walking briskly,&#xD;
with his square, firm tread; as if he enjoyed the moonlight and&#xD;
the exercise, and whistling Belle. Brandon's song, Ruth wasin&#xD;
bed and so sound asleep that she would not wake up nor answer&#xD;
him; and poor child! her life ran in such a devious channel&#xD;
afterwards that she never asked him to tell her his story again.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER THIRTEENTH.&#xD;
CHAR ITY.&#xD;
THERE had sprung up quite a furor of charity in MilIille&#xD;
for the Eagans. The widow showed .so earnest a desire to help&#xD;
herself, that people were willing to aid her. Ths Claytons and&#xD;
the Walsinghams heard about her, and sent groceries and fruits,&#xD;
and Mr. Bradshaw and Peter went down with cabbages and pota-&#xD;
toes enough to make an Irishman's paradise. Even Mrs. Deacon&#xD;
Williams- hunted, out some clothes, and an old hat for Dennis.&#xD;
The ripple $we led\ to quite a current; and Mrs. Eagan trimmed&#xD;
her small craft and sailed down the stream in such prosperity as&#xD;
was new to her. The clerks in the stores, and the writers at the&#xD;
factory encouraged her with their washing, and she told Ruth,&#xD;
smiling, that she felt sure now to be able to keep the babby.&#xD;
"An' look at -lte legs of her," she added, triumphantly exhibiting&#xD;
two mottled sticks about the size of smart pipe-stems. Sonsie&#xD;
proved handy and helpful, and Pigeon endorsed her at sight.&#xD;
Dennis got a boot-black's place in the Millville House, and the&#xD;
whole family looked to Ruthaas guardian angel.&#xD;
The three weeks which followed the sewing-society were very&#xD;
pleasant weeks indeed to our Chris. She spent many of the&#xD;
evenings by Ruth's cosy fireside, with her new friend Bertha,&#xD;
chatting and playing, or sitting with folded hands in delicious&#xD;
idleness, while George read aloud, and interrupted the reading&#xD;
with amusing comments and artistic' explanations, sometimes&#xD;
wandering quite away from the theme, into anecdotes and specu-&#xD;
lations, such as Chris, with her- active imagination, particularly&#xD;

liked. She worked faithfully through the daily tasks, unflagging,&#xD;
though her mother piled Ossiaon Pelion, because every gloaming&#xD;
there came a deputation from the Horse-Shoe, either Ruth, or&#xD;
Bertha, or George, or sometimes all together, to fetch her away&#xD;
for a delightful reunion. However-much the irate widow wanted&#xD;
to refuse, she could not find the way, for they knew how to con-&#xD;
quer her ; and Chris was so cheerfully Tidiffereut to the daily re-&#xD;
peated scolding, that it fell dead from the pinched lips which reeled&#xD;
it off so glibly, and sometimes I fear it dinned into a sing song in&#xD;
her unconscious ears, while her scarlet lips were wreathed in a&#xD;
softsmile, and her truant thoughts were reveling amongheripre-&#xD;
cious memories, or the, gaities of the Horse-Shoe. She did not&#xD;
talk much on those happy evenings, but when pretty Bertha Gro-&#xD;
enveldt put her two ars around her neck and kissed heir lips,&#xD;
her cheeks would become suffused with a soft glow, and a 1ok ofk&#xD;
ineffable happiness would steal over her, and melt. into her face&#xD;
and attitude:,. the quiet joy of a soul at rest.&#xD;
Belle Brandongot a habit of dropping in quite familiarly, some-&#xD;
times accompanied by her adored, oftener. alone.; with what object&#xD;
she best knew. Otho could not have been the attraction, for he had&#xD;
gone away prospecting to Chicago directly after Ruth's tea fight;&#xD;
a tried friend' of the dear old Professor having offered him half&#xD;
his practice, as well as a partnership in the chemist's shop which&#xD;
he owned. But at any rate, Miss Belle made herself very agree-&#xD;
able, was witty and lively and amusing, with her stories about&#xD;
Newport and Saratoga, and her aunt's town life and parties, hit-&#xD;
tang off the peculiarities of the persons she described with ridic-&#xD;
ulous force, and using 'her rare powers .of imitation. George&#xD;
aided and abetted her, and she exchanged a gay badinage, with&#xD;
him, to which Bertha listened in great amusement, and which&#xD;
caused.Ruth to send troubled glances from the radiant beauty to&#xD;
her stalwart husband, and secretly' to sigh, feeling old and faded&#xD;
and quite quenched by contrast:; and she and Chris would both&#xD;
get silent, and fall into reveries sometimes, while the other three&#xD;
had. all the gay talk to themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW, GOLDSMTITH'SDAUGHTER.              21&#xD;
.OQer day, afterthe crocus were up, the two girls made a merry&#xD;
visit to the old school-house, the flannel petticoats and. dresses in&#xD;
their arms,,which Ruth. pointed out triumphantly to George as&#xD;
the first fruits of the sewing-society. Sonsie, with rher headr up,&#xD;
followed them,}great baskets of provisions in either hand,.gathered&#xD;
among -the Roaring Riverites.-f- They were about to celebrate the&#xD;
baby's safe recovery from. measles, and Mrs. Eagan; looked on,&#xD;
all smiles, while they put her into a suit-Hof new clothes. .The&#xD;
little waif would grow. and thrive, and get plump, in spite of its&#xD;
inauspicious beginning. The place was scoured: and cleaned as&#xD;
nicely as could be, and Dennis- had applied. his first savings to&#xD;
getting, new glass for the. windows,and he and Sonsie had fenced&#xD;
the small space before: the house with.short sticks gathered, out of&#xD;
Bradshaw's woods,:and, trim little. beds were already sowed with&#xD;
cabbages and onions, and the warm   light soil, where the sun&#xD;
shone all day .long,[was a famous place for. their garden.&#xD;
If the widow had kissed the blarney-stone, she had gotten also&#xD;
a,grateful look into- hereyes,.and a. tone. of sincerity into her&#xD;
voice, which seemed true and honest, and she bustled" about, set-&#xD;
ting atable at which they were all to have upper together, with&#xD;
a face which looked . contented and. cheerful. The children had&#xD;
had their bread, and .milk in their new tin cups, a present from&#xD;
Hauxshurst.   Mrs. Bradshaw sent them a; pailh of'fresh milk&#xD;
every evening, now, and. Bertha. brought forth a vase, which she&#xD;
had decalomanied herself from  a cologne bottle, filled with fra-&#xD;
grant hyacinths, for the center ornament..&#xD;
.     .e"tThere  they.. stood, and  there  they  grew,&#xD;
Red, and white, and purple, and blue;&#xD;
And some had hearts like a-drop-of blood,&#xD;
And some like a drop of dew;&#xD;
My beautiful, beautiful flowers."&#xD;
Mrs. Goldsmith insisted that her blue calico should be bestowed&#xD;
upon Sonsie, though Mrs. Williams said that them Kalihans had&#xD;
a couple of young ones that was about naked, and Mrs. Gold-&#xD;
smith had retorted with a sniff that she had better stir her stumps&#xD;

&#xD;
and clothe 'em then, but this dress should go to Sonsie Eagan&#xD;
anyway ; and that young lassie wasdn high feather over her new&#xD;
toggery, and strutted about, with her arms akimbo, admiring it&#xD;
over her shoulder.&#xD;
"Isn't it 'decent, Miss'Chris? a small bit too tall for me; and&#xD;
look at the puckers in the tail of it."&#xD;
Chris laughed, and badesher take it off and let her put a tuck&#xD;
into the skirt, while the kettle was boiling. Sonsie obeyed, and&#xD;
sat down close -'to her on the floor, and anxiously followed the&#xD;
nimble fingers with an eager glance.&#xD;
"Indade, but I should like to sew like that," said she, sighing.&#xD;
"It's like the merry birds that your little hands look, flying and&#xD;
flitting, and you've a blush on your cheek like the dawn of the&#xD;
morning, and it's pretty that you are, anyhow, altogether--as&#xD;
pretty as beads."&#xD;
"Sonsie, Sonsie ! you mustn't flatter," said Chris, gravely;&#xD;
"'that's very naughty."&#xD;
"And is it flathering that ye mane, Miss' Chris. It's thrue for&#xD;
ye, I couldn't name it to the likes of such a sweetness; and you&#xD;
so good to me. Just let me love you, that's a lady; I'm only a&#xD;
coarse'little bit, that I feel, but the kind words, they melt into my&#xD;
heart so, they make it ache- sometimes, when you and Miss Bertha,&#xD;
speak softly and look a smile at me; sure and 'there's charity&#xD;
enough in your eyes to keep the poor from starving.' You don't&#xD;
know 'what'hard words are, Miss Chris; they cut like a knife.,&#xD;
You don't know what it is' to be out on the streets, knocked about,.&#xD;
starved, with never a friend."&#xD;
Chris raised her humid eyes and regarded Sonsie curiously.&#xD;
" The heart knoweth its own bitterness," murmured she.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER FOURTEENTH.&#xD;
THE CROSSING SWEEPER.&#xD;
THE little talk down at the old school-house was' but a begin-&#xD;
ning between the two girls, who were much the same age. Son-&#xD;
sie developed a marvelous talent for story-telling, and Chris froze&#xD;
to her while she narrated in quaint phrase their landing from the&#xD;
great ship crowded with misery ; their heart-breaking ,struggles&#xD;
and sufferings in that vast whirlpool of strangers which engulfed&#xD;
them. Their poor mother sick, 'their father disheartened, and&#xD;
silently enduring; when she and Dennis workegl and begged for&#xD;
the rest, she did not say how bravely. And Chris's great eyes&#xD;
brimmed over sometimes, as she followed their wanderings, and&#xD;
her vivid imagination filled up outline pictures with painfultrials&#xD;
of scoffing words and bitter, childish tears.&#xD;
One afternoon, by special pleading of Ruth's, and a promise of&#xD;
twelve button-holes, she had been allowed to bring her sewing' to&#xD;
the Horse-Shoe, and Sonsie had been unusually graphic and heart-&#xD;
rending in her reminiscences, Chris slipped away from them all,&#xD;
and as Pigeon just then awoke screaming from some elfin dream,&#xD;
and Ruth had to bustle about the supper, they did not miss her till&#xD;
they were ready to sit down at table. Then' after calling in Vain,&#xD;
George went peeping into the dreary parlor, scarce hoping to find&#xD;
her, but there she sat, in a heap on the floor, after her usual fash-&#xD;
ion when working out her thoughts. She had a sheet of paper&#xD;
on her knees, above Ruth's great family Bible, and the penciled&#xD;
lines on it were all blurred and blotted with her tears. She did&#xD;
not hear or heed George, so far away from Roaring River, was&#xD;

she, wandering and suffering in the heart of the great, p'tiless&#xD;
city.&#xD;
"Come, miss," called out George, in his hearty voice, laying&#xD;
his hands on is knees, and stooping to have a good look at her;&#xD;
"are you leaving yourself out in the cold so as to get accidentally&#xD;
frozen to death ?"&#xD;
Only deep sobs replied to him. Then he came closer, and'&#xD;
lifted -her face.&#xD;
"'What is ii, pretty child ?" asked he,.witi. hlarge-Hearted ten-,&#xD;
derness.&#xD;
" Oh dear," sobed Chris, raising her tearbluirred eyes, " I'm&#xD;
so unhappy, sp dreadful! cold, starving, beaten.; no pity any where.&#xD;
Only to die; that 'is all, that is quiet rest," she shuddered:&#xD;
" Who ?" asked George.&#xD;
"Fair, very fair ; hazel' eyes and golden hair," and she knew&#xD;
what mother love was too ; before she- before they-"&#xD;
" What's this?" asked George, seizing the paper.&#xD;
" She used to be such a happy child. She came and alighted&#xD;
on her mother's breast like a pretty summer butterfly. The ten-&#xD;
der mother who had nothing else to love," continued Chris; giv-&#xD;
ing up the sheet irresistingly, " and so good and merry. Oh&#xD;
dear! oh dear !"&#xD;
George looked at her a nioment-at her eyes which were fixed&#xD;
on hisaface but saw him not, and her quivering lips: and took her&#xD;
hands in his ; they were like ice, and lay passive in his grasp; he&#xD;
raised her up forcibly.,&#xD;
"1Come little maid, it is full time for you to come out of'this;&#xD;
this won't begin to do, you know;" and he carried her as if she&#xD;
1 ad been a feather-weight in his strong arms, out by the cheerful&#xD;
fire, where she dropped into a chair, and covered her face..&#xD;
George motioned to them to leave her to herself. "Come&#xD;
here duck," said.he. "I expect I've got the key here."  Ruth&#xD;
came up and leaned her hands on his massive shoulder, and looked&#xD;
over the page with him while he read aloud.&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW    GOLDSMITH'S. DAUGHTER.                 217&#xD;
THE -CROSSING SWEEPER,&#xD;
Her dress was thin and ragged and scanty,&#xD;
Her pitiful eyes looked hollow and wan,&#xD;
Her sorrowful features might have been pretty ;&#xD;
If they had not been pinched, and squalid and dirty;&#xD;
Every sweet trace of fresh childishness gone.&#xD;
All day she had swept, intthe mud and the mire,&#xD;
And her half-frozen feet had nor stocking nor shoe,&#xD;
Though the bustle and din of the city surged by her,&#xD;
Not a dime had she gained the weary hours through.&#xD;
Each blast of the wind that fluttered her rags,&#xD;
Showed her thin, naked limbs, haggard and blue ;&#xD;
But she still plied her trade, on the slippery flags,&#xD;
Though the day was all gone, and it chillier grew.&#xD;
A gentleman crossed; she asked for a penny,&#xD;
He called her a beggar; thrust her rudely aside;&#xD;
Her purple'lips quivered, and her pitiful eyes,&#xD;
In their meekness, reproached the hard man in his pride.&#xD;
With a curse on his haughty lips, he lifted his cane,&#xD;
And her sad np-turned face showed a deep livid stain.&#xD;
She sobbed; more from heart-break than from the sharp pain,&#xD;
She shivered and shuddered in the mud and the rain,&#xD;
Then clasping her broom, she wandered away&#xD;
From the pitiless man, up the crowded highway,&#xD;
With the stream of gay folks, who were steadily passing,&#xD;
The sweet rosy children, dancing and laughing;&#xD;
Past the well-lighted dwellings, cheerful-and gay,&#xD;
With their tea-tables set, in tempting array;&#xD;
Till she came to the wide open door of a church,&#xD;
And she softly crept into the deep sheltered porch;&#xD;
And hugging togethereher. thin garments so old,&#xD;
She tried to.forget she was hungry and cold.&#xD;
She heard the solemn organ, and the voices of the choir,&#xD;
And thought about the happy days around the pleasantly fire,&#xD;
In the cheerful dear old homestead; and the sunshine on the style,&#xD;
In the pleasant grassy meadows ; and her gentle mother's smile.&#xD;
Then a great light shone around her, and the'doors seemed to open 'ide,&#xD;
And a radiant figu e gligled through, and camesoftly to her side;&#xD;
A lovely, winsome lady, all robed in purest wgite,&#xD;
Soft, trailing, fleecy garments, soft eyes full of loving light;&#xD;
No rustle from her presence, no foot-fall on the ground ;&#xD;
Bpt the braided lilies ini her hair perfumed the air ameound.&#xD;

WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
The little maiden raised her hands, and .murmured, "'Tis dear mother,&#xD;
That tender, tender smile, oh ! how could it be any other?&#xD;
Let me creep up to your heart, and snuggle on your arm,&#xD;
Upon your soft, precious bosom, let me lie and be warm.&#xD;
Oh I had to sweep the crossing in the bitter pelting storm,&#xD;
And I lay on the stones all the horrid night, and never, never warm;&#xD;
I knew how sorry you would be, dearest.darling dear,&#xD;
To see your poor pet suffer so, with hunger, cold and fear;.&#xD;
You always used to comfort me, if; I only shed a tear.&#xD;
But that'weary time is over, and you have come at last,&#xD;
With your kind arms wrapt around me, I'm forgetting all the past-&#xD;
You told me you were:going to God, to his heavenly abode,&#xD;
I tried so hard to follow you, but 'twas a cold and stormy road.&#xD;
Now you'll take me with you, mother, to the home all warm and bright,&#xD;
And you'll never leave your -darling baby another freezing night.&#xD;
Oh wrap me closer, closer, mother, lay your face on mine,&#xD;
And kiss me on my cheeks and lips as you used in the happy ti ne.&#xD;
Ah! I'm sorry for the poor little children out in the wet and cold,&#xD;
Yes, ask dear Christ to comfort them, and fold them in his fold.&#xD;
Mother, I'm warm and happy, I'm going fast asleep-,-&#xD;
Your dear arms wrapped around me, your sweet breath on my cheek;&#xD;
No hunger nor cold for me to-morrow-I shall not wake to weep."&#xD;
All the prayers were-over, the people going:home,&#xD;
They found the little crossing-sweeper lying prone upon the stone,&#xD;
A smile of ineffable gladness lighted her childish face,&#xD;
And they gazed in reverent sadness, so holy seemed the place.&#xD;
Poor weary little wanderer'! her sorrows all were done,&#xD;
Her faded eyes shone radiant now in the:glory of the throne,&#xD;
Her muddy broom lay on the figs-she had gotten a-golden crown.&#xD;
As George finished with a. perceptible quiver in his deep voice,&#xD;
Ruth dropped her face upon his breast, and heavy sobs issued&#xD;
from Sonsie in 'the corner.  She had thrown her apron over her&#xD;
head and sat rocking to and fro, as close as she could squeeze to&#xD;
Chris, who never moved.&#xD;
"'Well! here's .a trying occasion !" spoke up George, clearing&#xD;
his throat.  "My duck and the rest of the feminines weeping&#xD;
plenteously.  I wish1I knew my role in this unexpected concate-&#xD;
nation of circumstances.   I must confess to an inclination to obey&#xD;
the singing-master's advice to his pupils, 'Let every:critterjine."&#xD;
&#xD;
Ruth moved softly away and put her arms around Chris.&#xD;
" It is God's world, dear," whispered .she ; " He carries the&#xD;
lambs in his bosom."&#xD;
A cheerful voice in the door-way brought them all back with a&#xD;
bound to Roaring River. Pretty Bertha Groenveldt smiled upon&#xD;
them, like a benevolent little fairy, and bade them " Good eve-&#xD;
ning."  When she had laid aside her. Waps, and _kissed Pigeon,&#xD;
they gathered around the tea-table, to which George handed Chris&#xD;
as carefully as if she had been a bit of, rare china, and though he&#xD;
could not help casting curious glances at 'her over the rim of his&#xD;
tea-cup, he exerted himself to recall the smile to her face, and ,&#xD;
charm her out of her sorrowful abstraction. And they all'made&#xD;
much of her, and went home with her to her mother's door, _and&#xD;
dismissed her 'with kving kisses.&#xD;

WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.        221&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER* FIFTEEN H.&#xD;
THE O L D -YESTERDAY.&#xD;
JUST as Chris had begun to feel life real, tangible, and worth&#xD;
having, Bertha went to Sulphrida for the baths; Ruth got busy&#xD;
with, her spring cleaning, and a heavy cloud settled above the&#xD;
poor child, cheerless and drearier .than ever, Mrs. Goldsmith&#xD;
moved about among her Lares and Penates, grim and glowering.&#xD;
She looked bilious, and probably was. I know she held that&#xD;
opinion of her physical state, because she swallowed great bowls&#xD;
of thoroughwort and wormwood, and hugely enjoyed the wretched&#xD;
faces poor Chris made over the doses which she forced down her&#xD;
throat. Victimized Chris! who had such shrinking horror of&#xD;
anything which.tasted bad; all whose senses were as delicate as&#xD;
Fine-Ears. The Great Tribulation was in frequent request, in-&#xD;
terspersed with Young's Night Thoughts and "Allien's Alarm,"&#xD;
and the morning devotions were commenced with "Lamentations"&#xD;
and ended with, " There is a fiery, dreadful hell."&#xD;
After the first sewing society, Sabrina and Zoe Walsingham&#xD;
called to see Chris twice or thrice. Sabrina felt a particular at-&#xD;
traction towards her ; perhaps because of her shyness, and difli-&#xD;
culty of access, for she was a self-reliant young maiden, and some-&#xD;
what confident of her powers of pleasing (was Miss Bradshaw,)&#xD;
but Mrs..Goldsmith looked so stiff and formidable with her prim&#xD;
spit-curls ; and the great wrinkles between her sharp eyes were&#xD;
so belligerent, and she infused so large a measure of fire and&#xD;
brimstone into her pious admonitions, that Zoe indignantly de-&#xD;
clared she'd as lief encounter the king of the Cannibal Islands&#xD;
after he had eaten the last missionary. Poor Chris was shy and&#xD;
(220)&#xD;
&#xD;
awkward, and silent-blushingly conscious of her hands and feet,'&#xD;
and her general shabbiness, and could not or would not talk. In&#xD;
fact, she could never think, of anything to say in her mother's&#xD;
presence; so the visit fell dead, and when Sabrina, upon rising&#xD;
to take leave, invited Chris to come and see her, Mrs. Goldsmith&#xD;
cut in before she had time to reply-&#xD;
"I don't never think best for girls to visit much; I never did&#xD;
when I was young."&#xD;
Sabrina colored angrily, and went off with her hedd in the air,&#xD;
and Zoe exclaimed, as soon as the door was shut behind them,&#xD;
with every symptom of disgust--&#xD;
" There, Sabrina Bradshaw ! I hope you are satisfied now. I&#xD;
told you so ! Don't ask me ever to undertake that ancient spider&#xD;
again. The girl is shamefully put upon and does not know it. I&#xD;
think I should like to see my natural protector speak to my visit-&#xD;
ors in that fashion. I would brew a little tempest for the stoney&#xD;
old lady if I had her to deal with-visit much, indeed!"&#xD;
Sabrina did not give up, however, and revolved sundry nice&#xD;
plans in her wise little head which were to bring her to be friends&#xD;
with the owner of those wistful brown eyes, positive that she&#xD;
could win her way if only she could get a foothold; and Sabrina&#xD;
Bradshaw was pretty sure to accomplish sooner or later, what she&#xD;
ardently desired.&#xD;
The library was still tabooed ; for Chris had, twelve shirts to&#xD;
make for my-lord Chandos, and the restriction was to remain in&#xD;
full force till her task was completed. The only really pleasant&#xD;
times she had left, were when she was alone in the great old-fash-&#xD;
ioned kitchen, watching or seeming to watch the cooking. She&#xD;
had four volumes of Penny Magazines, which her dear papa gave&#xD;
her whenshe was a wee child, and whose pictures and stories had&#xD;
been a mine of instruction and amusement carefully worked. It&#xD;
seems ,strange that these books, so full of everything enjoyable ,&#xD;
as well as useful, so enriched with graphic truthful delineations of i&#xD;
what children ought to know, should not be found in every nur-&#xD;
sery library. All honor to the noble Society who gave them to&#xD;

us, andsdead thanks'tothe good heart whoPbeautified and enriched.&#xD;
my own childhood ;with these treasures. ,&#xD;
What a pity that Co many mothers are asleep to the fact that.&#xD;
they can create a love for reading in their, children. They keep,&#xD;
back and hide froi them a;source of, enjoyment precious in soli-&#xD;
tude. If they are plain and unprepossessing, these friends will&#xD;
not snub them. If in later life the shelter of the home-roof is&#xD;
theirs no longer, the world turns cold to them, and the ".dear five.&#xD;
hundred" ignore their existence, they havestill a solid pleasure to&#xD;
fal back upon, which can be enjoyed in shabby garments even&#xD;
better than in the most resplendant attire. Oh! whys will you-&#xD;
mothers suffer jour children to pass through childhood mere ani-&#xD;
mals. It is, not all of life to eat goodies, or play with toys,,&#xD;
though these pleasures are not to. be despised. Your time may&#xD;
he better employed than. in "riotous needlework."  You may be-&#xD;
stow upon your, children beautiful thoughts, ideas; teach them&#xD;
grand facts:. A sunset. walk affords a, theme, an autumn leaf an&#xD;
inspiration., Don't , forget that they have everything to, learn.&#xD;
You are surprised sometimes to see them hang upon. your words.&#xD;
How they look into your eyes when you read to them  tales; of&#xD;
aginals, of birds,.of fishes, of reptiles, and how eagerly they pur-&#xD;
sue their investigations for the verification of what they-hear. I&#xD;
have seen a little child lie for hours and watch _a beetle at his.&#xD;
labor, or the restless workers in an ant-hilly and when the natural&#xD;
history of, the busy creatures who so interested her was read and&#xD;
explained to her, she listened in wrapt interest, though: some of&#xD;
the words were long and unfamiliar, and she pursued :her inquir-&#xD;
ies with busy little .face. and serious zeal, and brought, new facts,&#xD;
as well as, odd specimens .to the next reading.. You may give&#xD;
them language: also., Their: whole inner life will "grow full and&#xD;
rich and worth ,something, and pure, -choice words will come,. at&#xD;
their command, in which to. give -.it voice and expression. Let&#xD;
your nurseread just one hour to her little charges when she puts&#xD;
them in bed,from. snome amusing, instructive story,,some simple&#xD;
history- r(the delightful4bbtthbooks are the very best .fo the&#xD;
purpose,) and your ears will not be pained with complainings,&#xD;
&#xD;
nor your 'eyes with sour pouting faces, over the earlyretiring hour&#xD;
when you give the signal for departure; and the reading weaves&#xD;
itself into their lives. - All children love pictures ; yet how many&#xD;
mothers deem it a foolish waste of their valuable, time to show&#xD;
and explain them. ' They say, "Lhave something more important&#xD;
to' do; I cannot afford to throw. away minutes in that- fashion."&#xD;
I have heard them say it, and have seen them push away the&#xD;
child with the proffered book, regardless of the beseeching, sore&#xD;
rowful little face, so dependent upon the 'mother for its sunlight,&#xD;
and take up a bonnet, which a milliner could fabricate so much&#xD;
more tastefully, or some embroidery, and bend their souls to the&#xD;
senseless task with a short, impatient, "Get away child; don't&#xD;
bother, I'm busy."  What are you mothers for ? if not to cultivate&#xD;
the -immortal minds of your children, and beautify and enrich the&#xD;
existence you have thrust upon them.without their'consent. Do&#xD;
give them something to think about besides when dinner will be&#xD;
ready. You train them to neat and proper habits, you dress them'&#xD;
so elaboratelythat strangers will turn and admire ; all very well,&#xD;
but oh how little ! how miserably thin. The foundation:you have&#xD;
to lay for education must be an every-day work, as ceaseless as&#xD;
the labor of the coral builders.' You must keep them in an at-&#xD;
mosphere of books; let them breathe it; live in it.&#xD;
I was amused with a visit I paid to a fashionable seminary, in&#xD;
listening to a recitation in English literature.' The names of a&#xD;
few standard authors, a detached verse or two from their writings,&#xD;
and' a few vague facts. But how could' they profit the girlswho&#xD;
had never previously heard the names of' the great ones. There&#xD;
was one tall girl there who knew something about Swift and Wal-&#xD;
pole, and the Lakers, and- she ventured' to tell -it, and she' was&#xD;
blandly endured by the teacher, and flippantly ridiculed' by the-&#xD;
pupils; who were giving, themselves during recitation to a study&#xD;
of each other's dresses, and sharpcriticisms of their style. With&#xD;
the best efforts of the best teachers, such'literature must be .com-&#xD;
paratively valueless, if there is no mother-built foundation. It is&#xD;
erecting a structure upon- emptyness, all the' teaching drops&#xD;
through, like water through a collandere If their minds had'&#xD;

been fihed with bits of instruction, as 'the;good god-mother filled&#xD;
the sieve with clay for her-dear god-child, there would have been&#xD;
bottom for the teaching, and it would have tarried to be a com-&#xD;
forter to its "possessor.&#xD;
It"is a good plan'when you read a, book to a child, to tell the}&#xD;
author's name, and what else he has written, and some prominent&#xD;
fact in his history. There are certain books which are precious&#xD;
to children, and grown folks as well, which every youngling has,&#xD;
aninalienable right to enjoy. That this is so, is, proved .by the&#xD;
beautifully illustratededitions that our publishers bring out, of -the&#xD;
old favorites, at Christmas time, to charm the dollars 'out of our.&#xD;
pockets:'With their rare delights. Mary Howitt's stories and bal-&#xD;
lads, Kirk White's poetry, Vicar of Wakefield, the  Grimm&#xD;
books--Reynard the Fox, Legends' of Brittany,:Norse .tales, The'&#xD;
Rat Catcher, Barefooted Maiden. Oh what a mine of enjoyment&#xD;
are'these and the like! Ever fresh, ever new-&#xD;
I was once;at a dinner-party-I don't go, often--and as plain.&#xD;
maidens are notinTmuch request, especially after they get a little&#xD;
elderlyjlI have plenty of leisure for -uninterrupted observation.&#xD;
Some fanciful allusion was -made, to Blue Beard, and ;a lady in-.&#xD;
quired who the individual might:be, as -if it had been Mr. Brown&#xD;
or Mr. Jones around the corner. When rallied upon her igno-&#xD;
rance of the world-known story, she replied-&#xD;
was piously brought up, and never allowed to read foolish&#xD;
story-books."&#xD;
Now I don't know but the lives of curious Fatima and, her&#xD;
grim'lord are as instructive as the memoirs .of 'the 'remarkable&#xD;
little'Samnys who were crammed ,with 'impossible ;learning or&#xD;
hot-house piety at three years old, with ,which theTract!fSociety.&#xD;
- is so fo'nd" of enriching.the libraries of' our4Sunday'schools; and&#xD;
certainly they are vastly:more entertaining. I look upon= nursery&#xD;
rhymes arid fairy tales- as a necessary part of education, and I&#xD;
sincerely pity the poor children who are so piously brought up as&#xD;
to be defraud ed:of their enjoyment. :'Bible stories will be appre r&#xD;
cited, and Bible precepts received-none the less heartily,-though-&#xD;
the fro ingli ng erekds that there:was- any old;woman who' lied 'in&#xD;
&#xD;
her shoe, and that Jack and Gill went tip the'hill to draw a pail.&#xD;
of water. And the sincere pity he feels for. poor unfortunate&#xD;
Jack, who' fell down and broke his crown, will not. interfere with&#xD;
his devotions.&#xD;
Do not you remeniber, dear old friend, when we were' children?&#xD;
Such 4, long time ago,-&#xD;
"Oh how far we must-have run,&#xD;
When the matin and the vesper&#xD;
Blend so mournfully in one."&#xD;
Said little Nell, " I did that yesterday."  Then reflecting, she&#xD;
added, "but it was an old yesterday."  It is now a very old yes-&#xD;
terday that you and I stood at our mother's knee, and studied the&#xD;
pictures in the great family Bible. We did not know that they&#xD;
weie' copies of Raphael's cartoons-; such information would Aot&#xD;
have been a brilliant light to our path had it been bestowedupon&#xD;
us; still the dear mother must at some time, have told us; some-&#xD;
body did, and who so'likely as she who always told us everything g&#xD;
we wanted. "'The death of Lazarus," " BarLJesus 'struck with&#xD;
blindness," the sudden fate of Ananias and Sapphira-this last,&#xD;
the text'of a most impressive sermon, which thrilled us with awe&#xD;
at each fresh contemplation of the figures. The departure of the&#xD;
bondwoman: and you put your little fingers caressingly on fiagar's&#xD;
sad face, and felt hon:eat grief' well up in your pure young heart,&#xD;
and brim over at'your 'eyes, as you listened to the cuious' tale.&#xD;
How you 'dwelt on the attitudes and expressions of the Patri&#xD;
archal group. -Can't you still see Abraham   as he looked to you&#xD;
then ? with his long white beard and mild eyes; he points toward&#xD;
the wilderness, whither the dnsky Hagar -must go with her dar-&#xD;
ling boy,'who clings to her in sad astonishment. 'There stands the&#xD;
pitcher and the loaf, but the doomed slave 'is looking her lastron&#xD;
the face of the master whom she loved. It serms to you a very&#xD;
hard case; alid there is Sarah peeping "out of the door of the&#xD;

I kissed them andthe white roses which they clasped, weeping&#xD;
blinding tears, long ago. The- dear' mother has: entered into her&#xD;
rest. Do not the pictures recall her sweet accents-her caressing,&#xD;
touch ?&#xD;
There was the old Geography which. you embellished and,&#xD;
illuminated with your first box of water-colors. The Frei h&#xD;
girls dancing in the politest of attitudes, whom you treated to a&#xD;
costume of brilliant carmine; the Spanish ladies, whose veils and&#xD;
fans you touched gorgeously with gamboge, and your pretty&#xD;
young teacher in her brown merino frock, laughed and admired.&#xD;
with you, and told you-tales of Castilian courage and Moorish.re-&#xD;
finement, which you drank in with eager ears. She married old.&#xD;
Beardsley, the soap boiler, afterwards, and you said you should&#xD;
like to shoot him full of peas with:your pop-gun.-&#xD;
Il know a family of four dear little daughters, and it is a pretty.&#xD;
sight to see them out on the lawn of a summer evening.. :They '&#xD;
are arrayed in their: mother's long robes, floating behind them,. in&#xD;
odds' and ends ,of ribbon and fantastic flower garlands; each with&#xD;
willow wand, -marching, posture making,:and declaiming. Every&#xD;
face is lighted with thoughts; . They are acting a story which they'&#xD;
dearly love. " Midsummer Eve," Mrs. Hall's delightful .creation,&#xD;
than' which, a, sweeter tale. of fairy doings was. never penned.&#xD;
Now they are earth spirits and air- fairies.. Honey-Bellland Night-&#xD;
Star dispute;the possession of the lovely baby, with the.malieious&#xD;
Kelpie. Queen.- They sympathize deeply.,in the ;trials of Eva&#xD;
and Sydney, and rtheiricheeks glow, and their eyes sparkle; they&#xD;
are alive: Their sports use all their muscles,; theyare full!of&#xD;
agile grace, but their frolic 'is note mere animal capering, like&#xD;
young lambs or little pigs with their tails curled over their backs&#xD;
Theie is a. moral and a rneaning' in their game right .must tri-&#xD;
umph,' and evil'mdst be punished. -Sometimes they'areBunyan's&#xD;
Pilgrims, seeking the celestial city. They struggle through the&#xD;
slough of despond- -they walk.with Great Heart:and Faithful, and&#xD;
I almost believeithey see the pearly gates across:the darkriver.&#xD;
They always=welcome:an ill-dressed little body among them with&#xD;
joy, if it has thinking soul in it iThe fashion of the world has&#xD;
&#xD;
no place'in-their estimate of their companions. It is not, " what&#xD;
hats and dresses do they wear," that they- inquire, but, what do&#xD;
they know?  Rich and vigorous: in, their child-life, they are not&#xD;
great in out-dressing or outshining their companions. They&#xD;
never dance at Saratoga till two o'clock .in the morning,9nor is&#xD;
their shining 'hair frizzed and crimped by merciless maids, but&#xD;
they can trip it featly on their own green-sward, and when.they&#xD;
open their mouths to speak, they utter something worth hearing.&#xD;
They live close to their mother Nature, and she shows them in&#xD;
all confidence her mysteries. "Acheta Domestica" is theirs, and&#xD;
"Homes without Hands," and they speak together of what they&#xD;
learn, and sometimes strike, out truths which set their eldeits&#xD;
thinking. I don't. know as they will get husbands, very likely&#xD;
they may not, but with such culture and such resources of their&#xD;
own, they will not turn sour if they don't. They will, make&#xD;
heavenly old maids. Thank Heaven there are some women who&#xD;
dan live, even though a man never "comes home to tea."  I, for&#xD;
one, have managed to get through life very comfortably so far.&#xD;
,But to return to our Chris and her Penny Magazines, she kept&#xD;
them hidden in a cupboard, in the pantry. Every yearly clean-&#xD;
ing, Dame Goldsmith, in her character of bustling housewife,&#xD;
hauled them out, and sourly anathematized them "nasty rubbish,"&#xD;
"silly picture trash," etc., and threatened to bundle themsup gar-&#xD;
ret or burn them, but there would come a look into Chris'-brown&#xD;
eyes, so like to her dead father's, that last night of his life,'when&#xD;
she had been virtuous and proper with him, but which, for all&#xD;
that was not a pleasant memory for her, that she had ended, thus&#xD;
far in knocking the volumes viciously together and throwing them&#xD;
back again.&#xD;
There was on- 'cleaning day, which Chris lived over, and over&#xD;
in 'the strange land where we wander with shut eyes, and she ree&#xD;
turned thence, shuddering, exhausted : with her bit ter tears. That&#xD;
day, she had been goaded to lay her hand on her books, and say,&#xD;
"they are-mine, my father gave them to me. , Heysees you now,&#xD;
and he' does ,not, love you at all, because you are so cruel and&#xD;
wicked to me."  The dreadful looks, the fierce angry words, her&#xD;

bruised flesh, and beyond these,that "fearful night in the thick&#xD;
darkness of the cellar, which her vivid imagination peopled with&#xD;
untold horrors, were agonies which she was forced often to compress&#xD;
into the brief space of her dreams, an'd which left her trembling,&#xD;
terrorastricken, withquivering flesh, and cold sweat drops start;'&#xD;
ing over her, when. every pulse-beat was 'a hammer sti-oke of pain.&#xD;
Her mother had forgotten'the circumstance entirely, shehad slept&#xD;
well after 'her nightly prayer, and if any meddling ,person hact&#xD;
told her-that she- hads planted a theme for bitter revengeful mus&#xD;
ing in the night watches, in her little child, by her ivholesone dis&#xD;
cipline,which stirred all her bad passions, she would have sniffed&#xD;
uponthe meddler, and said, "oh shaw, such little shavers don't&#xD;
remember their lickings half as long as they ought to. I guess&#xD;
'm the best judge about bringing on her up, and IhaCalate'to d&#xD;
just about as I am a mind to.""&#xD;
Iere then, bythe old cupboard, under the window, among the&#xD;
bright glasses and shining pans, Chris came and read, every odd-&#xD;
moment she could command, while the dinner was cooking, or the&#xD;
coffee Was' roasting, It was just high enough for her to rest her&#xD;
elbows upon, as she leaned over her s'olume  She could never&#xD;
reposefully' seat, herself, so subject was she to frequent 'calls.-&#xD;
"Chris". here, "Chris" there, like poor Figaro. Fl erhothee&#xD;
seemed always to'be on the alert to make occupation for her, but&#xD;
she returned again and again, and read and re read, and pored&#xD;
over the 'familiar pictures. They were dear old friends. ' The&#xD;
spice trees and the -mangos, the fishing cormorants, the"Chinese&#xD;

of hileous patchwork bed' quilts which she ski'finad "'mor n sir&#xD;
thousand pieces of' calicos into em, and she did 'every bit on't."&#xD;
The excellent widow built no castles, and- I don't know as:she&#xD;
could'help glowering on Chris as she did, when the child's dreamy&#xD;
eyes. looked afar off, and she sat with1her:idle fingers in her lap,&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH' DAUGHTER.    '  22.9&#xD;
&#xD;
while her busy fancy revelled among her estates'in Spain, and per-&#xD;
haps she thought she did her plain duty, when she pounced upon&#xD;
her and brought her homt to reality with a jerk.&#xD;
"You're Goldsmith all over," she said one-day, when particularly&#xD;
aggravated, "alers dreamin about nothin, you'd read yourself into&#xD;
an ampus and izzard, if you' was let alone, and never do a'pesky&#xD;
thing.' She emphasized her peroration by seizing " Bettina,}&#xD;
and throwing it on the table with a bang. Chris jumped,- and&#xD;
threw a loving,-longing look after her lost treasure. She had only&#xD;
discovered it that morning, among Chandy's school books;'and&#xD;
hidden it under her work, hoping to catch a moment for it now&#xD;
and then between her stitches.~ Just a line or. two was better&#xD;
than nothing, and gave her subject for thought while she plied'her&#xD;
task. The good matron came very near burning it up, only gee=&#xD;
ing her son's name on the 'cover i the gilt stamp he was aecus-&#xD;
toned to impress upon his books, saved it.&#xD;
My thoughts were wool-gathering, I confess, mother, but you&#xD;
shall see how I will hurry now. Do not blame dearest Bettina.&#xD;
It is true' what she says :"These thoughts are they not apples;&#xD;
which are ripened on the tree of wisdom, and which it casts down&#xD;
into the lap of the loving ones who abide in its 'Paradise and rest&#xD;
in its shadow ?"&#xD;
She raised her wistful eyes. If she hoped for a pleasant 'look&#xD;
or a motherly smile, she might as well have kept them upon. her&#xD;
work,. for then perhaps they would not have filled with 'pitiful&#xD;
tears, and her mother would not have sniffed at her with 'such&#xD;
soul' contempt. Yet it is true, Widow Goldsmith could 'prform a&#xD;
muscular' contortion which she' believed' to be a smile, when Chan&#xD;
dy chaffed her in his half fond, half insolent way, and-he'would&#xD;
pull her about when he felt inclined, like a clattering fossil. Just&#xD;
now she screwed her sharp eyes into Chris' downcast face, and&#xD;
scratched her gathers till they squealed again.&#xD;
"If you had one speck of come up to you, you might look like&#xD;
somebody and work'night-gowns and shifts for yourself like&#xD;
other girls. There was that flippery Zoe Walsingham had on a&#xD;

like to, spank 'her,)" she added with unpleasant recollection of&#xD;
some of Zoe's stinging speeches,&#xD;
Chris looked up astonished. "When should I find, time for&#xD;
embroidery? after Chandy's things are all done, and the house-&#xD;
work finished ?" Then noting the savage frown upon the maternal&#xD;
countenance, she added quickly, "I really don't. care for such&#xD;
things. I don't see the useof cutting boles just to sew them'up&#xD;
again..; I think plain clothes are ever so much prettier, and&#xD;
where's the use of spoiling my eyes and pricking my fingers for&#xD;
nothing ; besides, I've often heard you say, mother, that you did&#xD;
not approve of such a waste -of time."&#xD;
Humph 1 anything is better than nothing, and I count your&#xD;
trumpevy reading worse than nothing and vanity. - Such balder-&#xD;
dash as you have been. talking.just now, the dog can't make noth-&#xD;
ing out on't. I'd try and whack up some clothes, and have some-&#xD;
thing to show for my time."&#xD;
Chris said no more, she had learned not to multiply words, but&#xD;
she privately thought that mayhap she had .as much to show for&#xD;
odd times, and as good store laid upfrom the trumpery reading,&#xD;
as if she had accumulated ever such a pile of wrought garments,&#xD;
which by the way, it is doubtful if she would have been allowed,&#xD;
to achieve, had she been' so inclined. She glanced down at her,&#xD;
faded, patched old gingham, and thence to the footed stockings&#xD;
prolonged from a pair of Chandy's socks, and smiled at the idea,&#xD;
of curious;needle work ; but as she had long ago learned to keep&#xD;
her thoughts mostly to herself. she plodded at the wristband she&#xD;
was double stitching for Sir John Chandos' seventh shirt, and did&#xD;
not speak again till she was ordered to the kitchen to wash the&#xD;
vegetables xfor dinner.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER SIXTEENTH.&#xD;
CHRIS T AI ES A WALK.&#xD;
The spring had -come ! . The robins sang its praises to Chris&#xD;
every morning, from the old tulip tree. The blue birds cairoled&#xD;
joyously toi her as soon as the rosy streaks shot up the east. They&#xD;
had inspected all the orchards, and found none so sweet a spot as&#xD;
the mossy fork in front of her window, which held their last year's&#xD;
nest, and they were already at work with sticks and straws re-&#xD;
pairing its walls,, and accepted, gratefully Chris contributions of&#xD;
swan's down, and silken ravels, for lining; and they were tempta.&#xD;
tons to the poor child, who could not help lirigem ing by her win-&#xD;
dow, bathed in the soft sunshine, watching their merry labors, ad-&#xD;
miringtheir delicate blue backs,:their red bosoms, their sweet&#xD;
songs, and the bright eyed familiar glances they gave her.  She&#xD;
fancied they remembered-her, and rejoiced to see her--again.&#xD;
Roaring River was dashing over the rooks at Madfalls, with&#xD;
mightfthunder. The purple anemones and star flowers were all&#xD;
abloom in the sheltered ridges on-the Hog's back. Chris im=&#xD;
agined she could smell their faint perfume, and the'wood-scent of&#xD;
dead leaves and mosses, as she sat in the great rooui stitching&#xD;
"with fingers weary and worn," upon the dreary shirts. She&#xD;
had not put her head out of do6r-s for a fortnight, excepting twice&#xD;
to church of a Sunday, and then, it was raining dismally. She&#xD;
was tired, depressed, her nerves all on the out side, and she looked&#xD;
wistfully up at the high-sailing clouds, and down the grass bor-&#xD;
dered street, and lost herself in a dream of what, she would do,&#xD;
if she were but free to come and go as she listed.&#xD;

WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
Suddenly she started to her feet, and dropped the sleeve she&#xD;
was gathering, her face all aflame, and her intent eyes glistening.&#xD;
"What's to pay now, I should admire to know ?'' exclaimed&#xD;
her mother, " you are as red as a rooster."&#xD;
" They've come, they've come !" said Chris under her breath.&#xD;
"'Who've come, what are you talking about ?"&#xD;
" Bertha Groenveldt and her. mother. They're from a Sul.&#xD;
phreda. I saw them drive past just now, and dear Bertha waived&#xD;
her handkerchief to me. Oh ! I'm so glad. They are at Ruth&#xD;
Blair's by this time--in the house-they kiss Pigeon, the smell&#xD;
of the daffodils comes in at the open window, how gay their voices&#xD;
so und  Bertha's sweeter than all, the laughing And the' talking,&#xD;
and they are so happy."&#xD;
1s. Goldsmith took off hefr spectacles to glower at her daigh-&#xD;
ter who stood with parted .lips, and humid smiling eyes as if she,&#xD;
saw it all,'and so greatly did she sympathize in her joy that-she&#xD;
could hardly refrain from, shaking her.  " Well! you do talk,&#xD;
petty, I must allow. The best thing you can do, is to set down&#xD;
in your chair and scratch them gethers. I'm about ready to sew&#xD;
them in. Such' crazyness ! did I ever."&#xD;
- 'Mother," spoke up Chris desperately, "'Do'let me tak a walk&#xD;
this afternoon. I'm sick, I'm faint, my hand trembles, a little&#xD;
run would' put new' life into me. I would sew enough faster af ier-&#xD;
wards{to make up for the time. If you knew how m hiend-&#xD;
jumps"' she pushed the 'hair from off her throbbing tbiples.&#xD;
" Fiddlesticks !" ejaculated the widow, "you are' not going&#xD;
galavanting any heres till Chandos' shits is done. You've kep&#xD;
em on the docket now till Im siek and tired of the sight of em.&#xD;
I don't feel the need of any walks ffor my health, and I don't se&#xD;
why youshould; just an excuse to get but doors. Why don't&#xD;
you tease to go down to the brook and get some Teppermint ; 'that&#xD;
alleys used to be the tune, and if I ever did let you go, you'd conic&#xD;
back drabbled up to your knees, and as nasty 'as pizen. if you'd&#xD;
a put in as you'd ought to, we might a' got this here shirt ready fbr&#xD;
Monday's wash. Just hang up your fiddle, aid stick to your,&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GO;LDSMITH'S. DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
233&#xD;
&#xD;
safTrng. You wear the flesh offof my bones with your shiftless.&#xD;
ways."&#xD;
'But mother," persisted Chris, with wonderful courage, "Iprom-&#xD;
ised Bertha I would come and see her just as soon as she came&#xD;
back, and it is so long since I have had anybody.to speak to."&#xD;
" Well, you do talk pretty., I should say I'd do for company&#xD;
if youwas so drefful put to't. I rather believe I'm your natural&#xD;
parent. 31can't help nothin what you told that Groenveldt girl,&#xD;
you'd best not naake promises till you ask me. I boss-this house&#xD;
myself. Time enough to go a visiting when the work is, all'done."&#xD;
"But, mother, I am afraid that time.will never come for- me.&#xD;
(Chris sank down-with a hopeless sigh). I would work ever so&#xD;
late to nightif I could only go."&#xD;
" To night ! just like yo;, burn out oil. 'I rather guess it ain't&#xD;
a matter of life and death for you to see them folks to-day, but&#xD;
still if you put in lively and finish your stent, I don't mind your&#xD;
runnin' round half an hour between day-light and dark,-when you&#xD;
can't see to sew. You shan't.have to say I ain't willin' to have;&#xD;
youtgo, if you care enough about it, to work for it."&#xD;
Mrs. Goldsmith was tolerably certain that her daughter could.&#xD;
npt finish her stent, but she calculated that it was a good way to&#xD;
get a deal out of her.&#xD;
"Put that nasty cat out door, the first thing -you do ; how you&#xD;
can bear him climbing all over you, and licking your face, and&#xD;
settin on your neck, I can't contrive. It makes me crawl, the&#xD;
pesky rep-tile."&#xD;
" I am afraid Bax Williams will shoot him if he goes out to-&#xD;
day, I saw him creeping about the garden fence, with a gun this&#xD;
morningg"&#xD;
"What if he does! no harm done. 'I wish he would for' my&#xD;
part, good for nothin ;creatur!l allers eatin milk.&#xD;
"Milk !" repeated Chris, " when did he get any milk?"&#xD;
"No impudence, Miss, besides he takes up your time. I can't&#xD;
aford, to keep cows for. cats. You are forever holding him and'&#xD;
talking to hm."&#xD;
I' I love him. Should be very sorry to lose Rainbow," (kissing&#xD;

hW as he iut iiii   a d iv to he face frotoghi'fdvrite jer h,&#xD;
and purred in her rosy ear.)&#xD;
"Pshaw! don't be silly about a   dwothlesscat! better keep&#xD;
some of your 'love for your kinfolk."&#xD;
"Perhaps I m-ight if they loved'nie as much 'as Rainbow does.&#xD;
I hav'nt sohmany friends that I can aftdord to despise even my cat."&#xD;
'If you don't hold your tongue," exclaimed Mrs. Goldsmith in&#xD;
a aggravated voice; "I'll thke and kill that creator myself. Don't&#xD;
letnid hearno more 'about the beast one way or other. Get&#xD;
out !' shei added,'rising and stalking to the door. lBefore-Chris&#xD;
had time to spring front her seat, she had opened it with a slam.&#xD;
"tScat ybu brute !"  (Thus she politely saluted 'flainbow.)&#xD;
The watchful Egyptian shot deftly past her, with enlarged tail,&#xD;
dodging her broom-stick, and flew, up stairs, instead of outside,&#xD;
unlatched Chris' door; and entered with a permow, as if to au-&#xD;
nounce'the fact to her,and ensconced himself in the middle of&#xD;
the bed, where he suffered the green gleams to die out of hig&#xD;
golden yellow eyes, and licked his paws at his leisure.&#xD;
After stitching half an hour in perfect silence, Chris gathered&#xD;
up her work, preparatory to retr-eating beyond1 the wvearfing,&#xD;
worrying over-look her mother kept upon her when she was in1&#xD;
sight. It was an even chance whether she would be allowed to&#xD;
go, butshe felt ds if she could not sit still any longer. Eyeing&#xD;
her sharply over, Mrs. Goldsmith espied a piece of paper sticking&#xD;
out of her pocket.&#xD;
"What's that ?" demanded she as suspiciously as if she had&#xD;
suspected a gunpowder plot.&#xD;
"A little sketch I made 'this morning of the' blue bids in the&#xD;
tulip tree," (pushing it hastily out of sight.),&#xD;
"kmuph ! another way4o fooloft' your time. What good will&#xD;
all your scratching and. sketChing do? ? athei all over !'t (this&#xD;
last in a queifulous 'undretorie.)&#xD;
" iniay'gt my living by"it one day, or soniething'else, and be-&#xD;
forelong too'"spoke up Chrie, facing hotly about, herhead thrown&#xD;
back, and het eyes kindling. "I can't- always drone on'here,&#xD;
there's something for mdto do in this ~orld  side savtig for&#xD;
&#xD;
WID OW GOLDYSM rfl'8 AUHE       3&#xD;
&#xD;
Chandos Goldsmith. I hate hirti!he's-a -selfish wretch, alwaysin'&#xD;
my way. I'd as lief die now, if I can't find any other occupation&#xD;
than to be his stitching machine."&#xD;
"4Well," ejaculated the widow. ".You do talk pretty, are you&#xD;
pQsessed, or what ?  A nice subject you are to talk abopt dying !&#xD;
Wheredo you suppose you would go to, you poor miserable sinful&#xD;
creatur?"&#xD;
" I don't know, and I don't much care. I don't find my life so&#xD;
pleasant thatI count. on it, and as for the future I don't believe&#xD;
my Heavenly Father will be so hard on me as you are, at any&#xD;
rate Papa. is there,; and you-"&#xD;
Chris stopped short, alarmed at her thought, astwell as. the:&#xD;
expression of her mother's face, which looked stony cruel; her&#xD;
black eyes darted fire, and her whole scalp moved visibly with&#xD;
the deep, wrinkles into which she drew her frowning, brow, and&#xD;
her teeth gnashed together; she seemed.about: to spring, and her&#xD;
bony hands contracted into claws.&#xD;
"Mother," exclaimed Chris, taking a step towards her, " for-&#xD;
give me, I did not mean to say so much, pray forgive me."&#xD;
After, a few minutes gazing at her in silent wrath, too great for&#xD;
speech, the widow said in a voice like a stab:&#xD;
"Get out of my sight Christabel Goldsmith. I believe you&#xD;
are given over to perdition. The devil desires to have you, that&#xD;
he may sift you as wheat, and .it's my opinion he'll get you; Up&#xD;
stairs with you! don't you show your impudent face down herb&#xD;
again till I call you, and there shall be weeping and wailing' and&#xD;
gnashing of teeth.'&#xD;
With this comforting lookout, poor Chris went slowly up stairs,&#xD;
and seating herself bythe window, began working in a weary,&#xD;
plodding way. She had forgotten alleabout Berthab inthe turnlt&#xD;
of her anger, and she sighed as she thought that her miotliertraight&#xD;
be right; at any rate she was- horribly wicked.  Now Rainbow&#xD;
came and seated himself: ou the window sill, and commienced a&#xD;
convers(atio1 with hisnistress, as if he readiher sorrowful thoughts,&#xD;
while he winked and blinked at:the bluebirds, wh werebusylin'&#xD;
the tulip tree, whose velvety -new leaves flapped in the soft  fad&#xD;

26        WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUNHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
and seerhed' begging her to admire' them, and he waved lis tail&#xD;
gracefully to and fro, bringing its ochrey yellow and sh ining black&#xD;
beauties into full view, allowing them, (the blue birds,) to believe&#xD;
themselves safely out of his reach, and finally he folded his double&#xD;
paws innocently under him, with a long drawn purr. Chris was&#xD;
allhe wished, for the present, and the blue birds might bide their&#xD;
time. But his companionship, usually so pleasant to her, his an-.&#xD;
tics so mirth-provoking could not satisfy her to-day. She did not&#xD;
look at, or speak to him. The constant'recurrence of such rasp-&#xD;
ings were wearing out her endurance, spoiling her temper, and&#xD;
her young life might have been so sweet if her mother had chosen&#xD;
to have it so.&#xD;
while that. irate matron was stitching in grim uprightness,&#xD;
thinking what an ungrateful daughter she had, and how piously&#xD;
she was doing her duty by her, and drawing out her waxen thread&#xD;
with an- echoing hum, which punctuated her thoughts, small&#xD;
carriage wheels sounded on the gravel walk, and a clear cheery&#xD;
voice, exclaimed upon the door-stone-&#xD;
"'Heaven bless the portal, open friendly wide,&#xD;
And send a kind god-even when you find us it beside.'"&#xD;
Mrs-. Goldsmith made a sour grimace, and said, snappishly,&#xD;
without looking up:&#xD;
"Eh! Ruth" Blair, I s'pose. Why can't you come in like a&#xD;
christian, and pass the time of day as other folks do ?"&#xD;
"Why, my dear madam, you surprise me'! My form of salu-&#xD;
tation was remarkably choice, not to say poetical. I  thought you&#xD;
would' like it."&#xD;
" You thought I was a fool, then, 'that's all," she replied, with&#xD;
a most disgusted: sniff  "I 'like common sense -and ,common'do-&#xD;
ings, and I don't believe in hifalutin folhde-rols.".&#xD;
No waysdtunted by this confession- of faith,-or the biting&#xD;
mood in which she found hei. hostess; little Ruth laughed merrilyy,&#xD;
while she proceeded to lift'Pigeon from his carriage, and seating '&#xD;
herselfby the window, she, divested  himof his wraps, andiset&#xD;
him'toddling on the floor, saying ,mischievovnsly:&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.              237&#xD;
"There, go and see grandma, and tell her 'good afternoon,' ,like&#xD;
a gentleman; you know you are the apple of her eye."&#xD;
The grim lady relaxed enough to glance down through her&#xD;
glasses, at, the pretty blooming child, who toddled up to her and&#xD;
smiled in her face, saying:," ood noon, dranma; I Pidden."&#xD;
The astounding information nade little impression, for 'dranma'&#xD;
did not move to caress him, an he turned away from her as from&#xD;
a stone image, and a very sti and gruffy one at that, and 'di-&#xD;
rectly laid profane hands upon her button-box, which he emptied&#xD;
in a twinkling, and sent the contents trundling in all directions;&#xD;
at which Mrs. Goldsmith remarked:&#xD;
" There ! of course ! Now I hope you feel better."&#xD;
" Where's Christabel, to-day, Grandma ?" asked Ruth, laughing,&#xD;
as she ran to the rescue.&#xD;
"Up stairs, I expect."&#xD;
" Can she descend, to see a friend ?"&#xD;
"I suppose she might," replied the widow, dryly; "she's got&#xD;
two good legs."&#xD;
"If you will permit me, Grandma, I'll just propound the in-&#xD;
quiry," replied Ruth, smoothly, enjoying in secret the widow's&#xD;
trucculent humor; and tripping across the floor, andout into the&#xD;
wide hall, she called out, merrily:&#xD;
"Christabel, descend; you husband waits for you to appear."&#xD;
"Humph ! what nonsense ! ' said Mrs. Goldsmith, communing&#xD;
with herself in a grating und r-tone.&#xD;
Chris came languidly.  1&#xD;
"Why how pale you are, and how woe-begone !".exclaimed&#xD;
Ruth, as soon as she-appeared ii sight. She had already guessed&#xD;
that something disagreeable'' had ,passed between mother and&#xD;
daughter. "And 'upon niy word, you are beginning to stoop !&#xD;
My dear Mrs. Goldsmith, we must force this poor dove out of the&#xD;
nest; she needs ozone. Come, hand. me that garment you are&#xD;
holding as if it weighed tons ; I feel moved to give .Grandma a&#xD;
specimen of my needle-work, while we chat pleasantly-together;&#xD;
we feel sociable to day. I've bags of news,.about the' sewing-&#xD;
society, and I can, talk- all the faster when my hands are busy.&#xD;

Now _then, Miss Chris, you just tieson:your bonnet, and use those&#xD;
two good legs which grandma has just assured me you are the&#xD;
happy possessor of, and try if you can persuade.a little rose into&#xD;
your cheeks and -sparkle into your eyes, so that you won't look&#xD;
quite so like-afaded flower,.and when you-come back. I'll tell you&#xD;
something which will greatly pleaseryou."&#xD;
Chris.stood irresolutely holding the shirt in her limp;grasp,iand&#xD;
gazing at her mother. She was heartily sorry for her wrong-&#xD;
doing, and if she had seen:a glance of love in the stony face, she&#xD;
was all ready to throw herself at her feet, and beg once more to&#xD;
be forgiven; but it was not there, and she turned 'her eyes upon&#xD;
Ruth, who was regarding her with :a curious mingling of emo-&#xD;
tions.&#xD;
"Bertha has come," said she, slowly. " Tell her I love her,&#xD;
and would come and see her if .I could, but, I'm  under orders,&#xD;
and-"&#xD;
Ruth interrupted;her, and. not too -soon, for her voice was rising&#xD;
into a bitter tone, and her face was hardening.&#xD;
"Yes, dear, she :has-gone up to Craigenfells to-day 'with-her&#xD;
mother ; she only stopped a moment at the ,gate as she passed,&#xD;
and she sent her -dear love to. you, and 'twas she whispered the&#xD;
secret to me which I'm to tell you after you have had your ozone."&#xD;
Chris felt a small grasp upon her skirt, and looked down at&#xD;
Pigeon, who was putting up his mouth for a kiss._&#xD;
"Little husband," said she, stooping: and picking him np "Can&#xD;
it be that the poor innocent child desires. to kiss me;lie does. not&#xD;
know what a reprobate I 'am ;" and then all at once her set 'face&#xD;
gave way, and. she broke down andbegan ito cry.&#xD;
"oConecome, Chris, hurry off; this golden hour ripens apace.&#xD;
Tell her tQ go, Grandma; indeed she .needs the exercise."&#xD;
The ,widow looked slowly up, and .said, as if against her will,&#xD;
and in answer to something in Ruth's 'face which compelled her:&#xD;
" Do goa! -"    The words did not sound like a blessing.&#xD;
"Anywhere,:anywhere, out of the world," murmured Chris..&#xD;
CI never took .no'waaks for my. health, when Iwas young:&#xD;
there ain't;no need on'L. Take, that ,basket of beans down to&#xD;

forever; I wish you could offer to do anything useful; setting'&#xD;
here dumb, when you knew very well that I wanted to get them&#xD;
beans down. That's just the :way; I always have to seepto ev-&#xD;
ery individual thing. You ain't so good as a stick."&#xD;
Chris dashed up stairs for her sun-bonnet. - There was the&#xD;
usual allowance of buttons off her dress, and her hair was ,in its&#xD;
customary untidy wad in -the back of her neck; but it did not&#xD;
occur torher to arrange either.; she gave not' a glance to her mir-&#xD;
ror, none of those trifling, pretty-last-touches which are ., natural&#xD;
in a young girl making a toilette); but seizing a pencil and sheet&#xD;
of .paper, she crammed them in her, pocket, and re-appeared in&#xD;
the hall, just nodding to Ruth, as she swung the heavy bask t n&#xD;
to her arm, and strode out through the door, Ruth-ran after'her.&#xD;
- 4What is it ?" Chris called out,:impatiently, over her shoulder.&#xD;
" Your chair, dear," Ruth. whispered; "and your dress, let me."&#xD;
" Oh, never mind, 'Ruth, don't stop: ie, please ; Ifeel : s if ;I&#xD;
should stifle if I can't get out of this house ; .it is as gloomy as an&#xD;
open grave. - Don't take hold of my arm, it sends prickles all&#xD;
over me. I know I shall be.called back for'something.if I don't&#xD;
make 'haste to get out of sight."&#xD;
" But dear, suppose-"&#xD;
"Oh, I shan't see anybody down there ; I'm not to go in, you&#xD;
know ; just leave my basket at the kitchen:door, like a good and&#xD;
faithfulservant."  She smiled bitterly; "and it is all the same,&#xD;
anyway, nobody cares. Well then, Ruth, somebody does care.&#xD;
I look stormy,.don't I? I feel as if I had been keelhauled. Qh&#xD;
yes, your face says I. an. behaving shamefully. Iknowrit; mother&#xD;
told me I was elected to-you know, (pointing downward,' with&#xD;
her fingers all stitched to a point;) perhaps I am; but there wen't&#xD;
be any shirts to make there for dear brother Chandos. Dreadful&#xD;
wicked, ain't it?  I wouldn't be as pious as mother if I could.&#xD;
You may as well give me over, Ruth, fora bad jobhad&#xD;

&#xD;
" Christabel !" said Ruth, seriously, and laying her hand on the&#xD;
excited child's mouth; "do not run on so; you don't know what&#xD;
you are saying."&#xD;
"Yes I do, Ruth; I wish I was dead, and she wishes so, too,"&#xD;
pointing toward the window. "And I'll tell; you a secret; if&#xD;
Chandos should die I would go to his funeral, and I would not&#xD;
shed a tear for him."&#xD;
In the midst of her wicked talk her lips trembled, and now her&#xD;
eyes brimmed over, and she hastily swung off her basket and&#xD;
threw her -arms around Ruth's neck.{&#xD;
'Oh, if my mother only loved me," she whispered,."I could&#xD;
bear everything. , I have not been good to-day; I spoke very&#xD;
undutifully to her, and she won't forgive me,; she looked at me as&#xD;
if I were a murderer, and said such hard things. Ruth, I want&#xD;
to be loved:; if I could be petted instead of scolded, I believe I&#xD;
could be like other girls. I am sure I was a good little child;&#xD;
my father loved me. I don't believe I am a reprobate."&#xD;
"You are over-tired, dear, and nervous," said Ruth, soothingly.&#xD;
",You are loved," she continued, with a kind caress, "very, .very&#xD;
dearly; here, kiss your little husband, who is coming, anxious for&#xD;
a last fond adieu. Kiss him sweet, and begone. Good bye;&#xD;
don't hurry'back'; I'll make it all right ; and remember I've such&#xD;
a nice tell for you."&#xD;
She stood an instant at the door, watching the drooping figure&#xD;
down the long walk, and out at the gate; and her face fell a little,&#xD;
and she almost forgot where she was, so busy were her thoughts;&#xD;
then she, turned so- briskly that it 'seemed a strong effort of will&#xD;
which recalled her, and said in a cheerful voice :&#xD;
"Now then, master Pigeon, you just pick up those roving but..-&#xD;
totse." -She led him back into the presence of the stone image:&#xD;
"Isn't he a pretty creature, grandma? Look at his dimpled fin-&#xD;
gers! how daintily he gathers up those shining playthings ! I&#xD;
really can not bring myself to believe that those rosy mites will'&#xD;
ever be large enough to make scythes and, such great iron mon-&#xD;
sters. Now you know the=next society will be: at Mrs. John&#xD;
Bisbee's, and-"&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH 's DAUGHTER              241&#xD;
But we will leave little Ruth to her task of entertaining and&#xD;
ameliorating her hostess, while we go with, our Chris on her&#xD;
pleasant walk alongthe grassy road-side, past mossy walls, over-&#xD;
grown with blackberry bushes all abloom with white beauty,&#xD;
mixed in with eglantine, sweet-meliing ai [ delicate, just spring-&#xD;
ing into bud ; and the shining squaw-berry vine, which in her gay&#xD;
childhood she. used to twine around her father's pictures, and&#xD;
wreathe about his forehead in imitation of the busts in his studio.&#xD;
How: the faint wood fragrance brought him back to her, his life&#xD;
and death, of which she every day understood more clearly the.&#xD;
meaning. She started a chip-munk which ran merrily along&#xD;
before her, springing, lightly across the low rocks, and seating&#xD;
himself beyond harm's way, with his brush elegantly curled over&#xD;
his back, and an acorn in his. cheek, and looked at her attentively.&#xD;
A couple of cat-birds were building in a low larch, and conversed&#xD;
sociably together at their work. She left the road, and made a&#xD;
short cut through the meadow and the wood lot, ancle-deep in&#xD;
rustling leaves. Here she paused to gather some wind-flowers&#xD;
and wild violets, and to pick a few tender wintergreens, adding&#xD;
solomon's seal and wood anemones, and adder's tongue to her col-&#xD;

and listened to the " wood notes wild," which made "unwritten&#xD;
music" all around her. Before she reached the Bradshaw man-&#xD;

thoughts in tune with the beauties she so dearly loved; and when&#xD;
she came upon a flock of young' lambs, chasing each other over&#xD;

fashioned mansion was as soft and smooth as velvet, and a dozen&#xD;
of creamy cattle, feeding on the knolls, stood out in the clear&#xD;
light, like some.of Wateau's warm creations i his favorite land-&#xD;
scapes.&#xD;
Mr. Bradshaw harrowed with patent harrows, plowed with culti-&#xD;
vators, reaped with reapers, had horse-rakes and horse-rollers, and&#xD;
all other implements which cunning Yankees have made available&#xD;
in husbandry ; and he took the Genesee Farmer, and the Rural.New&#xD;
Yorker, and the Agriculturist, and read "'Downing," and "Bevan&#xD;
on the Bee," and got up seedlings and Bradshawii; and imported&#xD;
Alderneys, and " sold a bull once in a while," like Daniel Web-&#xD;
ster; and got over " Ram-Saguls," and " Cotswolds," and talked&#xD;
up the firm with Peter the younger, and heartily enjoyed all the&#xD;
pleasures his occupation could afford, and what is more, he made&#xD;
it pay. Barnum says his potatoes cost him fifty cents apiece.&#xD;
Mr. Bradshawr raised the-finest sorts, and his were a profit to him,&#xD;
and he got richer and richer every harvest. His mare, "Dainty&#xD;
Pet," won all the races at the county show, and beat her celebra-&#xD;
ted sire-out hollow. He never thought any care of his stock too&#xD;
much trouble, and they paid him well in health and beauty. He&#xD;
kept his wife, the delicate little Alice Craigenfells, like a 'queen&#xD;
in her household,.all ordered and arranged to. her liking. His&#xD;
eldest-born, Peter, followed in his footsteps, and was his firm friend&#xD;
and co-helper. He was a tall, straight, rosy-checked youngster,&#xD;
with health and strength enough for two, and' as good as gold.&#xD;
Sabrina, the golden-haired, had her way, and her ponies, and her&#xD;
dogs, and, her aviary and conservatory,.and her books, and every-&#xD;
thing else she wanted; and little Pauline frolicked free as air,&#xD;
and was gay as a lap-wing, and as mischievous as a magpie-&#xD;
a regular enfant terrible, putting her voice into every one's mat-&#xD;
ters, and her busy little fingers into everybody's pudding, as li-&#xD;
censed as a king's jester.&#xD;
Christabel Goldsmith ought to have been a familiar guest of&#xD;
this household, by right of being her father's daughter, and&#xD;
her own qualities and acquirements; but she was never seen&#xD;
here, except on some errand like the present, which she dispatched&#xD;
&#xD;
243&#xD;
&#xD;
in a few words at the kitchen door, and hurried swiftly away, for&#xD;
fe ar she should encounter Sabrina. She walked down the long&#xD;
drive-way, with her head bent, and her bonnet drawn close, and&#xD;
at the gate she heard childish voices and merry laughter away.&#xD;
out among the trees in the orchard; and she turned aside, and&#xD;
paused to look at a group which charmed her artist-eye. Then&#xD;
glancing carefully around, and making quite sure no one saw her,&#xD;
she climbed upon the mossy wall, and taking out her pencil, she&#xD;
bcgtan to sketch wih a free hand the figures before her. The&#xD;
spreading apple-trees, 'adorned with their rosy blossoms, the rich&#xD;
carpet of green grass beneath, on which were sitting two little&#xD;
gi-ls, busily engaged in dressing - i baby-costume a huge tabby-&#xD;
cat, who purred complacently during the trying ordeal. A doll's&#xD;
carriage, a cradle, the rightful occupants of which were huddled&#xD;
together in disheveled heaps on the turf; a scarlet shawl, swung&#xD;
hammock-like from. the low branches ; the long rich sweep of&#xD;
lawn beyond, dotted with tiny ponds, and just a glimpse of Roar-&#xD;
img River shining through the pine trees. The white-shelled.&#xD;
walks and drives, winding about and about ; the flat Arden, with&#xD;
fantastic shares of f iwer-bed, on the other side, backed by green-&#xD;
houses, all glass and iron, light and airy, and aflame with fuchsias&#xD;
and cacti, and scarlet geraniums, framed in by shining cape-jessa-&#xD;
nine'which wreathed the slender pillars; richly carved vases, stand-&#xD;
ing on pedestals, and filled with amarylis and agapanthus; striped&#xD;
century plants and African aloes,- sitting' stately and still in the&#xD;
glowing sunshine. The whole shut in by Craigenfells mountain, up&#xD;
whose lofty sides were creeping the gray smoke-wreaths. - And'&#xD;
from the distant lake came the scream of the lonely loons, who&#xD;
pursued their arrowy course over and 'through the clear, waveless&#xD;
waters, and dipped their deep-black collars, in twisting, turning&#xD;
dives, beneath its cool surface.&#xD;
Chris forgot her daily worries and her horrible wickedness, and&#xD;
worked in hearty enjoyment of her freedom, and the sweet influ-&#xD;
ences of the time and place; her'sun-bonnet thrown-back, and her&#xD;
small head bent, while her cheeks crimsoned, and her eyes lighted&#xD;
with pleasure.&#xD;

A hearty burst of merriment caused her to look up from the&#xD;
tree she was sketching, into her middle distance, and she beheld&#xD;
Rainbow, with a; night-cap on his head, which was as square and,&#xD;
massive as his Egyptian progenitors ; a .long mantle floating&#xD;
gracefully over .his mottled sides, and tied at the tip of his tail&#xD;
with streamers of crimson ribbon, and his four legs decently-clothed&#xD;
upon with drawers borrowed from the denuded dolls; a tiny veil&#xD;
depending from his pointed ears. He was sweeping over the&#xD;
grass in a long gallop, with the laughing gii-ls in full pursuit, their&#xD;
curls flying out, and their garments fluttering in the rapid chase.&#xD;
" Permow !" said Rainbow, pausing at the foot of the wall&#xD;
Where Chris had perched herself; then glanced over his shoulder&#xD;
at his waving tail and floating streamers,, as if to call her atten-&#xD;
tion to his adornments. His pursuers were close upon him, but&#xD;
he skillfully evaded them at the last moment, when their four&#xD;
plump hands were extended to seize him, and their panting, warm&#xD;
breath dashed over his face in sweet gusts. He clambered up the&#xD;
rough stones, and standing in triumph by his mistress' side, he&#xD;
seemed to laugh all over at their defeat.&#xD;
" Why, Rainbow ! how did you get here so'soon ?  I left you&#xD;
pa the window sill, watching the blue-birds. You must have&#xD;
gotten on your seven-leagued boots to make such speed."&#xD;
Rainbow rubbed his glossy head against her hand, and looked&#xD;
at her out of his yellow eyes with an almost human fondness.&#xD;
" Oh, we do have such fun with Rainbow ! He is such a clever&#xD;
old fellow, I wish he would be our cat and stay here," said Gracie&#xD;
Jenkins, in her soft little voice.-&#xD;
" Perhaps he had better," replied Chris, knitting her brows;&#xD;
"if he has found a home where he is loved and wished for, he is&#xD;
more fortunate than his mistress."&#xD;
"Look ahere, Chris !" broke in Pauline, leaning her elbows on&#xD;
the moss, and gazing at the face above her ; "look ahere ! you've&#xD;
been crying ; your eyes are as red as fire! Now what's the mat-&#xD;
ter ? I want to know. I wish I was a man; then! I do. I'd fix&#xD;
the wretches!"&#xD;

&#xD;
"I think life is all floating in tears," said Chris, drearily. "r&#xD;
wish I dould go away to some place where there wasn't anybody.&#xD;
I wish," she added, glancing up at. the moon, which hung pale&#xD;
and clear in the deep azure ; " I wish I could go up to the moon."&#xD;
"That's no place to be alone, you-silly Chris," retorted Pauline.&#xD;
" Don't you see there is a man in it ?"&#xD;
"So there is, you funny little thing," replied Chris, smiling&#xD;
down upon her up-turned face, which with its sharp, black eyes,&#xD;
little nez retrousse, and wicked, roguish look, afforded a piquant&#xD;
study.&#xD;
"Oh yes, very funny now ; sometimes Tam called a trouble-&#xD;
some lttle thing, and Sabrina's maid, Racine, calls me 'little&#xD;
nose;' she says I poke niy nose into all her affairs. I make her&#xD;
awful mad sometimes, and I get mad, too. I did that time, all&#xD;
about you. .I wished I 'was Blunderbore, to eat everybody up."&#xD;
"Oh, Pauline ! how dreadful! You quite terrify me with such&#xD;
confessions," exclaimed Chris, clasping her hands in pretended&#xD;
fright ; "who was it ?"&#xD;
"Dulcet Pettibone made a long tale to Captain Slocum about&#xD;
how you spilt the things into Belle Brandon's. lap, and she was so&#xD;
tickled that she squealed and laughed, and the Captain said 'haw,.&#xD;
haw,' so hateful. I think they were real mean to make fun of&#xD;
you, Chris. I love you and Rainbow, but I've thought how I can&#xD;
pay them off."&#xD;
"low ?" asked Chris, more amused at Pauline than hurt by&#xD;
the reported merriment at her expense.&#xD;
" Don't you wish you knew ?" replied the little lady, with an&#xD;
elfin twirl, which set all her raven curls floating. "I'll tell you:.&#xD;
I shall flirt with their sons, and break their hearts."&#xD;
" What a brave little champion it is !" said Chris, laughing,&#xD;
and trying to catch- her .in her airy dance. She might as well&#xD;
have essayed to entrap a wandering breeze. Suddenly she&#xD;
stopped.&#xD;
" Moses ! what's that ?": shouted-she, reaching up and snatching&#xD;
the drawing. " Why, Gracie ! if this isn't, us ! That's me and&#xD;
my dolly, and that is you and Rainbow-all of us ; and look-a-&#xD;

here, Chris was ipttinrg Some verses 'on= the back side ; that's&#xD;
about us too, I expose. I ,can't read writing myself, I-wish I&#xD;
could ; Sabrina has got a lot of letters tied up with a blue ribbon&#xD;
that I should like'ever so much to know What's into them; but it&#xD;
all looks like hen's tracks to :me. I have heard, them say that&#xD;
Chris could write pottery ; is this, pottery ?"&#xD;
"Don't say pottery, Pauline," entreated gentle .Gracie. " Its&#xD;
potry."&#xD;
"No it isnt either; it is pottery. I guess I know."&#xD;
" I guess I know, too. I've made some myself-only a short&#xD;
little piece, but papa;liked it; he laughed and read it out loud to&#xD;
mama, and she laughed, and said it was pooty."&#xD;
" Poh ! I don't believe it," disputed Pauline, setting her feet&#xD;
apart and resting her hands on her hips, and looking personified&#xD;
incredulity.  " Let me hear it myself."&#xD;
I knew a little girl, and she was pretty sick,&#xD;
And she sent for my papa, and she died very quick."*&#xD;
Chris laughed merrily. -"I should advise -you not to spread&#xD;
that potry if you have any regard for your father's practice."&#xD;
"That's .just what papa said ; but he laughed and squeezed me&#xD;
ever so-"&#xD;
"Come, come ! don't bother," broke in Pauline impatiently-&#xD;
" I want to hear this that Chris 'Us been making. Read it out&#xD;
loud."&#xD;
" Hand it here then ; I have not got my old sight yet, and con-&#xD;
sequently I can't see so far off; but this is not poetry, Pauline,&#xD;

" What a lt of talk I when I want to be hearing," said P:auline&#xD;

"Oh! it must 'e-gay to be young and happy,&#xD;

" But I say, 'Chris, did'nt you call it doggerel ?"&#xD;
" Yes, I believe I did ; have you any objection to the name"?"&#xD;
" Yes I have, because it is'nt doggerel."&#xD;

was about to receive a delicate conplitnent, al the' more vanablu&#xD;
from its sincerity.&#xD;
" No, not a bit of 'it.  It is catterel, all about Rainbow."&#xD;

Chris laughed softly, a few little merry, tinkling notes, exceed-&#xD;
ing sweet and pleasant; though she laughed but seldom, she had&#xD;
the art of making music when she did.&#xD;
"Now I think," said a deep voice behind them, "that it narrowly&#xD;
escaped being poetry."&#xD;
Chris started up, very red, and turning quickly around, she&#xD;
found Mr. Otho Groenveldt leaning leisurely against the old wall,&#xD;
and taking in the whole ,scene with an ,air of quiet enjoyment.&#xD;
The landscape, the rural quiet, gay flowers, and pretty children,&#xD;
all pleased him, and lighted up his face with one of his rarely&#xD;
pleasant smiles. As his eyes rested on Chris, she sank down&#xD;
again, and plucked nervously at her gaping garments, and jerked&#xD;
up her sun-bonnet, till then suffered to hang by its strings down&#xD;
her back. Always at a disadvantage ! The only few times in&#xD;
her life when she would have cared to look. well ; perched like a&#xD;
tree-toad on the old wall, clothed like a scare-crow, and that har-&#xD;
lequin cat at her side like a figure in a carnival ! She would have&#xD;
liked to melt into a mist and disappear. With the bitterest mor-&#xD;
tification, she regretted too late that she had not taken Ruth's ad-&#xD;
vice, and made, hasty resolves for the future; but pity the poor&#xD;
child, her trials were not nearly over ; careless habits, even at fif-&#xD;
teen, are obstinate, and require a steady struggle. The well-&#xD;
dressed young gentleman, leaning there so carelessly and looking&#xD;
full in her face while he talked, seemed not a whit disturbed by&#xD;
any uncomeliness or short-comings.&#xD;
He took off his hat, and offered his ungloved hand with grave&#xD;
courtesy.&#xD;
" Might I be permitted to look at the sketch ?" asked he, smil-&#xD;
ig, "siee I have played eaves-dropper to the catterel. I take&#xD;
n uch merit to myself, I assure you; I'was greatly tempted to&#xD;
commit the indiscretion of peeping."&#xD;
,He stretched out his hand calmly as he made the request, as&#xD;
though there could be no question of compliance, and Chris sur-&#xD;
rendered it quietly, without a word of apology or objection. He&#xD;
critically examined its details, and pointing to the wide spreading&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
branches of the apple trees which Chris had,,sketched cleverly,&#xD;
he said-&#xD;
" There is a painting of three trees which is very famous-"&#xD;
" Oh yes," interrupted Chris quickly, lighting up and forgetting&#xD;
all about her appearance, "Rembrandt's picture--full of wind and&#xD;
tempest, and dark thunder-clouds, but with the sun setting in&#xD;
glorious brightness, breaking through them in strange bewildering&#xD;
gleams, almost supernatural effulgence, and such a deeply shad-&#xD;
owed foreground that it looks like a haunt for those dreary witches&#xD;
the Germans are so fond of bringing into their stories. But I&#xD;
don't like Rembrandt. He was a-miser ! I despise misers," she&#xD;
added with bitter vehemence.&#xD;
While she talked, she had busied her fingers in divesting Rain-&#xD;
bow of his mardi-gras costume, and he laid his head in her lap,&#xD;
resting it on his outstretched fore" paws, and keeping fearless&#xD;
watch of the stranger out of. his yellow eyes, with their line of&#xD;
green fire in the middle: as not' yet fully assured of his righteous&#xD;
behavior.&#xD;
" This is a vigorous sketch, Miss Goldsmith," said Otho, with&#xD;
the faintest flicker of an amused smile playing around his mouth&#xD;
at the easy way in which she had taken up and aired the topic he&#xD;
had offered her. " A very vigorous sketch. You have thought&#xD;
much about nature, and have also profited much from the instruct,&#xD;
tions of a master."&#xD;
"My father taught me, sir ; we were to have gone abroad when&#xD;
I was sixteen."  She ended her sentence with a deep sigh, and a&#xD;
shadow chased the shine from her ever changing face.&#xD;
"And you were sixteen how many years ago."&#xD;
" Not yet, sir; only fifteen I hope, with so much to learn and&#xD;
so little done," she replied, surprised, a little piqued, and looking&#xD;
fill into his questioning eyes. He caught the rich glow on her&#xD;
face, and the deepening intense expression the "so much to learn"&#xD;
brought into it, which may have been his intention.&#xD;
" Oh yes, of course. I was stupid to ask such a question, as&#xD;
.well as a little improper, perhaps. I should have remembered&#xD;

" A Saint Jaques'. pilgrim, that barefoot plods the cold ground&#xD;
upon, with sainted vow, her faults to have amended. God save&#xD;

He bowed low, and got blushes, but no answering salutation.&#xD;
She was vexed with herself for putting the teazing words into&#xD;
his mouth. He was evidently amusing his leisure by making her-&#xD;
talk, though with theirgravest 'of eyes.&#xD;
" And when you don your cockle hat and shoon, and humbly&#xD;
tell your beads, and take your alms, will you also know your Ber-&#xD;

"11know qnite well when I-am laughed at, sir,' even though the-&#xD;

say I. deserve it, but neither you nor any one else can comprehend&#xD;
my feelings on this subject. It.has been my dream of happiness&#xD;
ever since I can remember. It wasencouraged by thebest friend&#xD;
I had, and the memory of the plans; and projects which gave me&#xD;
such unmixed delight, is' one of my few holy things."&#xD;
"On the contrary, Miss Goldsmith, I believe I do understand&#xD;
you perfectly, and I assure you I had no intention to laugh at&#xD;
you; but the pilgrim suit befits you less than the violet crown.&#xD;
Better -Sappho than Helena. Let me see=-you are fifteen, you&#xD;

"If I could but believe you a true prophet, sir!" S'he smiled&#xD;
incredulously, and shook her head.&#xD;
"I am willing to ;stand by my opinions, Sappho, at any.rate.&#xD;
Come, I'll wager this ring," pointing to an emerald on his finger,&#xD;
" against that ebony pencil you hold, that I shake hands with you&#xD;

WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.             -251,&#xD;
" Lend me your pencil, Miss Christabel. I should like to try it&#xD;
on this important entry."&#xD;
Chris watched him curiously while he wrote.&#xD;
" Do you take my wager ?" asked he, smiling.&#xD;
"One may not bet upon certainties," she answered, trying her&#xD;
best to understand his odd manner.&#xD;
"Indeed; where did you pick up that piece of information?&#xD;
You regard your journey as certain, then ?"&#xD;
" Oh-no, indeed, sir ; quite the contrary."  She shook her head&#xD;
mournfully.&#xD;
" Nevertheless I feel assured that on the alp I will restore this&#xD;
sketch;" here he put the drawing and the memorandum book&#xD;
carefully in his pocket, and handed back. her pencil with a bow&#xD;
of thanks. " We will get our supper of black bread and chamois&#xD;
steak, which I shall have shot in the morning, secretly, among a&#xD;
party of wild schuts, (that is, the chamois, not the steak,) and&#xD;
afterwards I will ask you to add to this slketch another picture-&#xD;
(you will be a fine artist by that time, fit to go to Rome)-and&#xD;
I will permit yon to put your idea of me and my wife into oils,&#xD;
(if it has the merit I expect,) in our Tyrolean costume, peaked hat,&#xD;
short coat, hob-nailed shoes for me, and velvet bodice, short striped&#xD;
petticoat and broad brimmed straw for her.".&#xD;
"Your wife," repeated Chris, in secret trouble she was not&#xD;
conscious of showing to him, scarcely of feeling.&#xD;
"Yes," he replied, gazing quietly at her. " Oh yes, my wife.&#xD;
'If thou ait to have a wife of thy youth, she is somewhere in the&#xD;
world ; therefore pray for her,' says Tupper. I feel sur-e there is&#xD;
one for me, therefore I have chosen without waiting for that ; and&#xD;
you will have to confess she is a lovely lady. I must serve for&#xD;
her as Jacob did for Rachel, not quite so many years, I hope,, and&#xD;
my task master will be the public. Marriage now-a-days means&#xD;
something more than it .did in the days of the patriarchs," he&#xD;
went on, as if in answer to a thought, and studying -Chris covertly&#xD;
the while. "Now    it signifies a free-stone palace, with bird-&#xD;

and opals and, diamonds, and an opera lox, and credit at Lord &amp;amp;&#xD;

pictures, and statues, and Saratoga and Newport-and Paris."&#xD;
" Oh, I could enjoy all that ; I ought to have it!" exclaimed&#xD;
Chris suddenly. She was looking afar off, with dreamy eyes, as&#xD;
if she saw herself floating in luxury and filled with delight at the&#xD;
gorgeous vision, so contrasted with her bare meagre existence.&#xD;
"You !" ;aid Otho, studying her intently, exulting in  secret.&#xD;
"-You, the poet, artist' maiden ! reared in'this nweet seclusion."&#xD;
" Don'tplease," answered she, looking down; and folding her&#xD;
hands over Rainbow. "You make me say such ridiculous things.&#xD;
But how can you who have had realities to feed your soul upon,&#xD;
comprlend my vain longings. I am every day upbraided with&#xD;
being a dreamer. I should be glad to leave off dreaming 'and&#xD;
commence living. I am sure I could enjoy, could appreciate such&#xD;

'lug absurd in desiring it, though I see such astonishment in your&#xD;

upon her formless gown and the great basket at her feet.&#xD;
" My wife will have all that, and more. She'shall tell you on&#xD;

"I cannot give you an opinion," she answered quietly. "I am&#xD;
not wise enough. I do not think it is necessary to be married to&#xD;
be happy. One can come and go and do as one likes, and be&#xD;
free, with money.. At any rate, I feel sure that marriage needs&#xD;
something more than all you promise your wife, to make it happy."&#xD;
" Indeed ; and what, may I -ask ?&#xD;

" I mean that they were not set forward in ycur statement, and&#xD;
were so far in the background in the picture you drew, as to be&#xD;
out of sight."&#xD;
"'Well answered, Sappho, wisely, most discreetly, and you are&#xD;
&#xD;
not an anthropologist."  He looked curiously at her, wondering&#xD;
how she would 'answer, even if she would comprehend him.&#xD;
" Does -it suit you, sir,' that monstrous doctrine ? are you will-&#xD;
ing to be 'only another animal ?'" questioned she indignantly.&#xD;
" Well no, Sappho, I cannot say that I am quite satisfied to ' be-&#xD;
long to the great brotherhood of vitality,' though the ' where,&#xD;
whence, and whither' is ingenious. I have pride enough in my&#xD;
manhood to make me cling to the 'exceptional origin."'&#xD;
" I ain thankful, sir, to my dear papa that he. taught me his&#xD;
creed-' I believe in God the Father Almighty, and in his Son&#xD;
Jesus Christ," she said reverently. " If one must be a 'grade of&#xD;
vitality,' vegetable nature would be nicer, because then one might&#xD;
be a flower."&#xD;
" Yes, a. pansy, Sappho."&#xD;
She smiled uneasily;: he looked grave, pleasant ; bu.t somehow&#xD;
she felt as if he was -amusing himself with her,--he tapped his&#xD;
breast with his finger.-&#xD;
" But you have not yet told me, little wanderer among strange&#xD;
doctrines, whether or no you will agree to my conditions, and&#xD;
confide to me this sketch to be restored, time.and place appointed."&#xD;
" A thing already disposed of, and hidden from sight, can scarce-&#xD;
ly after that be confided to the hider. You bring me back to my&#xD;
cruel position, which I'had altogether forgotten while you talked&#xD;
with me. You remind me that I have lost my best, my only&#xD;
friend, and 'am helpless and alone. I shall never leave Roaring&#xD;
River, however much I desire it. I am  chained as firmly as&#xD;
Prometheus to his rock, and almost as pleasantly."&#xD;
"Still you venture nothing in giving me a promise never to ask&#xD;
me for your three trees, till I restore them of my own free will,&#xD;
after the supper, when we sit on the porch, L and my wife beside&#xD;
me; and also to make that other picture which I find. I greatly&#xD;
desire. The Groenveldts as Tyroleans."&#xD;
"If the scribble you profess to beg. of me, when it is already&#xD;
safe beyond my reach, has any value, you may add it to another&#xD;

the lights are wondrously 'lovely on those alps. The narrow&#xD;
valleys, where the roads come to be mere bridle paths, and then,&#xD;
but threads up the mountain sides, the sounding water-falls, and&#xD;
the deep dark pools among the rocks, the steep pineelad rhoun-.&#xD;

fanciful balconies overhanging the abrupt declivities, the quiet&#xD;
churches with their pointed steeples, the lonely shrines, the wind:&#xD;
mills, and 'the -pretty burying grounds, all these show well in the&#xD;
moonlight. We shall see such sights from our alp." .&#xD;
While Otho went on talking, descanting, describing, and- with-&#xD;
out absolute questions, drawing her into his talk,' Chris suffered&#xD;
her, eyes to rest on his face as if he had been really the old famil-&#xD;
iar friend, he had told her up at Craigenfells he aspired to be, and&#xD;
she entered into the pleasure with zest, nay, with sunny expansive&#xD;
good humor, and girted with the topics lie offered her, tossing&#xD;
them airily about among odd conceits, and whimsical suggestions.&#xD;
Ie, outwardly grave and cool, secretly wondering at and ad-&#xD;
miring the witty thoughts and their graceful word clothing, and&#xD;
he was startled at the sudden shutting in of her radiant face, as&#xD;
Rainbow rose hastily: thus disturbing her pleasure, breaking it&#xD;
up as a pebble troubles the mirrowed'picture in a sunny lake, and&#xD;
she bought herself back from dreamland,' and sank into an ab-&#xD;
sorbed reverie, with fixed eyes and expressionless obscured vis-&#xD;
age, her fingers plucking idly among the dried mosses at her side.&#xD;
Rainbow rose and darted away on a private errand. You see&#xD;
one day when he was wandering up and down in the woods, he&#xD;
came upon a blue racer, who was sitting on her tail and swallow-&#xD;
ing her young ones ; he watched the proceeding in ferocious as-&#xD;
tonishment, while she, having disposed of her brood, looked him in&#xD;
the eye, and her throat stuck outlike a fishing cormorant's-pouch.&#xD;
He rose to expostulate with her upon her cannibal propensities;&#xD;
she waived the argument and disappeared in a hollow stump.&#xD;

eften and often had: Rainbow pawed and smelt around that stump&#xD;
in the hope of daring that wretched mother out to battle ; and&#xD;
just now, lying upon his mistress lap, for some unaccountable rea-&#xD;
son, a vision of the horrible gourmandism dashed over him in. a&#xD;
fresh light, and he set off on a keen jump to stir up the blue&#xD;
racer, and force her to explain be.r hideous conduct.&#xD;
While they had been talking, the sun had declined, and the&#xD;
children had carried their fun and baby-things elsewhere. Miss&#xD;
Sabrina Bradshaw, being moved by the spit it of unrest, saunt-&#xD;
ered out at the great hall door for a walk. She had on a clear&#xD;
pale violet dress, exquisitely fitted and fashionably cut, her round&#xD;
hat crowned with its ivy wreath, swinging from her arm, by its&#xD;
tied strings, her wavy locks put up in ;elaborate empress braid-,&#xD;
not a pin wanting, not a thread awry. She was a very hand-&#xD;
some girl despite her red hair. Her skin was like pure marble,&#xD;
her features, clear-cut and faultlessly regular, and her figure tall&#xD;
and graceful. As Chris caught sight of her, sailing down the&#xD;
avenue, utter dumbness took possession-of her, and she withdrew&#xD;
into her shell, and clasped the lids hastily together. The sense&#xD;
of her shabby dovsdyness overwhelmed her .afresh, by contrast,&#xD;
and she colored up to her hair, as she glanced furtively at Otho,&#xD;
and fidgeted, andsought around her with her frightened wild deer&#xD;
look, as if about to dart away. Sabrina came eagerly up, as.soon&#xD;
as she espied her, both hands extended, and her face beaming.&#xD;
"Naughty girl! why did you run off without asking for ine?"&#xD;
Chris stammered something about being in a hurry.&#xD;
"I-should think so," replied Sabrina, laughing. '-You look like&#xD;
it.  Ah, Mr. Groenveldt ! To the brave belong the fair. You&#xD;
see I have not forgotten our merry game of proverbs up at lirs.&#xD;
Blair's. Am I to believe you the magnet who drew Chris away&#xD;
from our hospital abode, which would also.have, opened to your&#xD;

"Not at all, I assure you Miss Bradshaw.  I'n only accessory&#xD;
after the fact. There was ' goodlie companies' here assembled&#xD;
when I arrived, and much merriment. So' far from  being to&#xD;

gerous spells and enchantments to hold me. She has spirits of&#xD;
earth and air in her command, triksey Preck and dainty Ariel,&#xD;
Night-star and Honey Bell obey her call."&#xD;
"-I cannot doubt it sir. I have felt her bewildering charm of.&#xD;
ten," replied Sabrina, laughing.&#xD;
" I consider three an uncanny number, anid must break up the&#xD;
triangular confab," said a merry voice. Chris started and turned&#xD;
about hastily ; could it be?  Yes, it certainly was, her brother&#xD;
Chandps, gay, good humored, strikingly handsome, and perfectly&#xD;
dressed. Such a brother as a girl might be very proud of, but&#xD;
she made no move to greet him, and instead faced short around,&#xD;
and fastened her eyes resolutely on the moss below her, and an&#xD;
aug ry frown darkened her face. Otho glanced curiously f. om one&#xD;
to the other.&#xD;
"Hallo, Chris ! Ain't you going to say, 'how-dy,' to a fellow ?"&#xD;
called out Chandos pleasantly; going up and seizing her unwil-&#xD;
ling hand, which he shook heartily. " Here's a' tall young lady&#xD;
I should like to-get presented to, (bowing to Sabrina,) I used to&#xD;
know little Saby, but aw ! this gorgeous creature in purple and&#xD;
fine linen, really."  He took off his cap and bent to the ground.&#xD;
" And this is Mr. Groenveldt ?  I see I must be my own usher,&#xD;
as no one else seems to find it worth while to take the office. I&#xD;
heard from one of our fellows, about the Art School. Slaughton&#xD;
is going there in tl:e autumn.   Ruth Blair told me you were in&#xD;
town, but she erred, inasmuch as she appended the false statement&#xD;
that you had gone up to Craigenfells."&#xD;
"Happy to meet you," he added, offering his perfectly shaped&#xD;
hand, comely and smooth, on the third finger of which he wore a&#xD;
handsome seal-ring. He spoke in an easy, confident way, taking&#xD;
the measure of his new acquaintance, -lookingshun full in the face,&#xD;
out of his 'well-opened merry eyes. As he turned 'again to Chris&#xD;
with a saucy glance, she mumbl-d somet'hii  unintelligibly, and&#xD;
slid off the wall and siood leaning against it, and fidgeting with&#xD;
her pencil, winding it up in her bonnet string, as if hei life de-&#xD;
pended upon its accurate adjustment. Sorrowful, troubled, angry,&#xD;
shy, angular, awkward ; as unlike her happy self of half an hour&#xD;
&#xD;
before, when she was lapped in dream land, expanding like a bird&#xD;
in sunshine, as she could possibly be. Otho sheltered her embar-&#xD;
rassment and Sabrina, without seeming to observe it, led the talk&#xD;
aily. She and thoughtless rattling Chandy tilted wits, and&#xD;
raked up memories with an interchange of telling' hits. '"They&#xD;
were well,; matched, and old wranglers, and unsparing of each&#xD;
other, ani Chris; under the pressure of her tumultuous thoughts&#xD;
could not help enjoying some of the hard raps her brother got.&#xD;
The orchard gate swung open quickly, and Peter Bradshaw,&#xD;
pere camie hastening along with great strides, his brows knitted&#xD;
and his eyes fixed upon a cluster of apple-blossoms he held in his&#xD;
land.&#xD;
" Whither away so fast, Mon Pere ?" asked Sabrina, with con-&#xD;
fident sauciness.&#xD;
He stopped at her voice, and his face cleared with a smile.&#xD;
She went up to him and clasped her hands, easily over his arm,&#xD;
after presenting her friends, whom he greeted with great cordiality.&#xD;
" What is the matter now Papa?   You are frowning quite&#xD;
savagely at those pretty flowers. I'm sure they look sweet and&#xD;
innocent"&#xD;
"Matter enough, my dear, these spiteful pismires are making&#xD;
their plans to eat the hearts out of all my early red' streaks.&#xD;
"You should obey the precept, 'Go to- the ant, thou sluggard&#xD;
consider her ways and be wise.&#xD;
"No occasion for taking the trouble, my dear, the ant comes to&#xD;
me. I do consider her ways to my cost, and devilish piratical-&#xD;
red-flag kind of ways I find them to be. 'Tis astonishing how&#xD;
a-&#xD;

bite like a serpent. Why, their name is legion, they go up an&#xD;
down like roaring lions.&#xD;
"I don't hear them roar, papa," laughed Sabrina. "I suppose&#xD;

know. Hunger obeys n6 laws. Necessity is a powerful weapon:&#xD;

"Why,2you reel off your proverbs as glibly as Sancho Pauza!,&#xD;

"-Oh, yes Papa, but I've a 'friend who can give you them in a&#xD;

Chris was hiding more than blushes, her eyes were full of tears.&#xD;
The kind, whole souled ways of excellent Peter Bradshaw with&#xD;
his :showy daughter, who hung about. him so fondly, made her&#xD;
owh loneliness more drearily forlorn.&#xD;
.Come to supper, young people," said the farmer hospitably,&#xD;
as :he walked away. "Have a little dance in the evening, if.you&#xD;
like. I hav'nt forgot how to fiddle, and Pete promises-to out do&#xD;
his. father on the cat-gut. Yes, yes, my darling, violin," he contin-&#xD;
ued 'in answer to a whisper from Sabrina, "but it used to be fiddle&#xD;
in my day."&#xD;
Chandy declined laughingly, but. promised soon to appear at'&#xD;
theinansion, and he and Otho shook'hands with Mr. Bradshaw,&#xD;
who hurried offto fight some of' his numerous enemies, and the-&#xD;
four young people strolled out into the beaten way-side path,&#xD;
Chandy and Sabrina leading the way.&#xD;
Chemin faisant, they came upon a-sharp angle the road makes,&#xD;
between Roaring 'River and Millville proper, which angle was,&#xD;
sheltered by a great oaks and defined the- extent of the Walsing-&#xD;
ham estate, which juts out here into a queer little corner. A&#xD;
close trimmed hedge of arbor vitae, having arches and doors cut&#xD;
in its clipped 'greenery, gave =glimpses of the grounds within:&#xD;
pleasant and extensive, but not kept up like Peter Bradshaw's.&#xD;
On thelawnwere clustered a group of young girls, holding mal-&#xD;
&#xD;
lets in their:gloved hands, dknoeking the balls about while they&#xD;
talked. They had evidently just finished 'their game,:and :were&#xD;

her. " Do you despise me utterly, that you shun me so !" asked&#xD;
she, half proudly, half imploringly. "Come let me be your friend,&#xD;
I wish it so much."&#xD;
Chris threw a swift, shy look at the splendid figure before her,&#xD;
and then at the friendly eyes which sought hers, and a soft smile&#xD;
wreathed her lips, though she still shrank away and shook her&#xD;
head.&#xD;
How shall the superb Paradise bird mate with the brown&#xD;
wren," said she.&#xD;
"cOh, you queer Chris," spoke up Sabrina, dropping a kiss upon&#xD;
,her cheek, and walking off to reclaim her glove which Chandos&#xD;
had picked up, and was making great show of pressing to his lips.&#xD;
Nobody heard this little by-talk between the two- girls, be-&#xD;
cause they had both turned their backs upon Belle Brandon, and&#xD;
scarcely, spoke above a breath.&#xD;
" What a, grotesque specimen of wooden image it is, to be&#xD;
sure, odder than ever," Belle murmured to her foil, throwing at&#xD;
the same instant a glance of bewitching simple gushingness, right&#xD;
into the eyes of grave Otho, which beauteous effulgence was en-&#xD;
tirely lost, for though he returned her glance, he was entirely oc-&#xD;
cupied in thinking over the conversation at the old wall, and he&#xD;
wheeled about just as the tempting lips- and dimples were ar-&#xD;
ranged to accost him, and went up to Chris, and began speaking&#xD;
in a low serious tone, taking hold of her hand. He had read her&#xD;
thoughts, and saw how-she intended to slip. away unperceived,&#xD;
and with the movement both quick and sedate; which was pecu-&#xD;
liar to him, he said:&#xD;
" Let us go, Sappho. Do not refuse. Indeed, I do not see well&#xD;
how we can help going It will make you too conspicuous, if I&#xD;
leave the party and walk away with you,: which I certainly shall&#xD;
do, if you are obstinate."&#xD;
"Needs must,.I- suppose, when somebody drives," said Chris,&#xD;
and her eyes sought his hastily, frightened at her impertinent&#xD;
speech, and fearing that she had offended him.&#xD;
"Quite true," he returned quietly, "and accept my thanks It is&#xD;
the somebodyso who have the right to drive. Of course the&#xD;
nobodys are incapable. You and I are somebodys."&#xD;
&#xD;
Candy began counting; "how many are we? one, two, three,&#xD;
four,"&#xD;
"And an.odd one," said Belle in a low voice, but not so-low&#xD;
as to escape Chandy's ear, who,- looked at her.  She was&#xD;
laughing, as were Zoe and Mary Ann Williams, and all three had&#xD;
their eyes fixed on Chris.&#xD;
The exquisite youngster winced a little, but laughed ,also; and&#xD;
he fastened a bold gaze upon Belle Brandon, which ought to&#xD;
have caused her to drop her eyes, but did not.&#xD;
Sabrina walked quickly up to Chris. " I am going to stay in&#xD;
your neighborhood; these chatterers are uttering such a deal of&#xD;
nonsense."&#xD;
"-Better tarry among your equals," said Belle; "those two only&#xD;
talk in polysyllables."&#xD;
Otho answered her. "A French writer has defined equality to&#xD;
mean, 'a desire to. be equal to your superiors and superior to&#xD;
your equals."'&#xD;
a.That's jnst my case," replied Sabrina, bowing; -"therefore,&#xD;
Mr. Groenveldt, I'll take your arm if you please."&#xD;
" Oh, for something wooden, whereon I might express applause,"&#xD;
said Zoe. "Ah, here is a block-head," She crooked her brown&#xD;
fingers, and saucily tapped Chandy's sconce.&#xD;
"You will find yourself in block-ade, and compelled to surren-&#xD;
der," exclaimed Chandy, "if you are not nimble." He extended&#xD;
his arms, as.if to enclose her within them, but she slipped through&#xD;
like an eel, and cried out, with crimson cheeks:&#xD;
" For shame, Chandos Goldsmith ! You are more impudent&#xD;
than ever. I wish you would take your block-head back to school&#xD;
again."&#xD;
As everybody always enjoyed seeing saucy Zoe paid off for&#xD;
her tricks, there was much merriment at her expense.&#xD;
The group moved on,.raking up old jokes of boy and, girl fun,&#xD;
belonging to the period when they went berrying on the hillsides,&#xD;
the girls in pinafores, and the boys displaying their. plump pro-&#xD;
portions in roundabouts.&#xD;

Othq conversed with Sabrina, and sawalblrChri s motions with-&#xD;
out looking at her. Comforted by this voiceless championship,so&#xD;
new to her, she struggled; hard' to dominate herself' so as not to&#xD;
dishonor it.&#xD;
About. half way: up they: sate down; in-. the: slant sunshine,&#xD;
upon a pile of rocks, to rest and enjoy the backward view of the-&#xD;
homesteads.ans the; hillsides. Belle separated herself from the&#xD;
foil, and artlessly waited; admiring the prospect, with pretty ejac,&#xD;
ulations and wide-opena eyes, till; all were seated; then shethrew&#xD;
herself down .beside Chandos, and turned: her face. toward- him,&#xD;
and made dimples, and; showed her, teeth, and talked with Zoe,&#xD;
.across him, in a state of simple innocence beautiful to. behold:;&#xD;
and my lord Chandos.did behold and enjoy, nothing loath.&#xD;
",Stop! stop ! Mr. Butterfly," called out Sabrina, " and' tell us&#xD;
where; you came from,"' pointing. to a. magnificent: fellow, sailing&#xD;
before. them on his downy-wings. "Yoare out of season, sir."-&#xD;
"As unseasonable as a lace hat in January, Monsieur Papillon."&#xD;
Belle made a, graceful spring, which was only effectual in showing&#xD;
her arms from which:her open. sleeves fell. back, and her taper&#xD;
waist and sank down, pouting,&#xD;
"Ungrateful, wretch, not to appreciate, such an attention,"&#xD;
laughed Chandy. "I shall behave quite.-differently, Miss Bran&#xD;
don, when you try: to catch me.'"&#xD;
"What: are you; to do for. lilies to rest -on,. and set off your&#xD;
color?"  said Zoe. "Don't you know you have wakened too soon?&#xD;
You will creep back into- your-house and stay till the roses and&#xD;
posies:come, ifryou.will take, the advice of a-looker-on in Venice."&#xD;
" In. Vienna" suggested. Chris,,unconsciously.&#xD;
" Did you make that remark as a correction, Miss Goldsmith,?"&#xD;
asked, Belle, pointedly.&#xD;
"It is Vienna," replied : Chris, shortly, and with an angry flush.&#xD;
" Come, I'll bet you;a hat of that," called out Chandos. " It&#xD;
reads. looker on in Venice. in, my book, and that is a 1633 folio,&#xD;
Heminge and,:CongelV'&#xD;
All agreed that Chandy was right, except Othoi who smiled at'&#xD;
Chris, and said nothing.  '"&#xD;
&#xD;
"You have not spoken, Mr. Groenveldt ;" Sabrina bowed po-&#xD;
litely.&#xD;
"J think I must coincide with Miss Goldsmith ;- she is certainly&#xD;
correct, as usual," he added, with a courteous hand-gesture.&#xD;
'That is not proven," said Belle;;"but we will' waive the ar-&#xD;
gument till a future time, unless Miss Goldsmith has her Cbn-&#xD;
cordance in her pocket, which I should think not at all. unlikely;&#xD;
she has the reputation of cramming voluminously."&#xD;
"In the meantime there'- goes the butterfly,"' said' Sabrina,&#xD;
making haste to speak. "Look, how exactly he is the color of&#xD;
those dead leaves. How I wish I' understood butterfly-ology; 'I&#xD;
am sure you can tell me, Chris, if you only will be so kind, his&#xD;
name."&#xD;
Chris hesitated, and while she twisted her - bonnet-strings she&#xD;
looked from Belle to Chandos, and' answered so low as only to be&#xD;
heard by-the two who were on either.side of her,&#xD;
" It is a Telea polyphernus, one of the American silk-worm&#xD;
family, and a remarkably large specimen. They are night-moths,&#xD;
and rarely seen flying about by daylight. It is not uncommon&#xD;
for them to come out at this time of year, but they mostly break&#xD;
their cocoons in June."&#xD;
" How did you find out all that,-Chris? ' Tell me what books&#xD;
to buy, and. I will have them, directly."&#xD;
" I gathered the worms, and let them spin themselves up, and&#xD;
watched them .come out of their pupa state. , It was very curi-&#xD;
ous; I cut a hole in the cocoon and covered it with a piece of&#xD;
glass, which I glued fast-so as to keep out the air, and I saw the&#xD;

" Catch that vagrant," Chandos," called out Sabrina, authorita-&#xD;
tively,; "we want him."&#xD;
"Shall I ?" said Chandy, tearing off his cap and giving chase.&#xD;
"Nbw, sir, make good use of those great brown fliers of yours,&#xD;

They all laughed,' except Otho and Chris. who hated to see the&#xD;
butterfly spoiled. He knew how to take care of himself very&#xD;
weil, however, and soared away to a high branch of the old oak,&#xD;
where he sat flapping his great wings; while Master' Chandy,&#xD;
who in looking too high had stumbled over a loose pebble, and so&#xD;
gotten a fall, wiped the dirt off his knees, ard replaced, his cap,&#xD;
-and dropped panting into his seat, very clo e indeed to Miss&#xD;
Brandon, who kept her ground nobly, nothing daunted.&#xD;
All at once there " arose so wild a yell," anon sinking low and&#xD;
plaintive, and then swelling in thrillingcrescendo on C sharp, with&#xD;
shakes and agitatos, and then lamenting in minor capriccios, mel-&#xD;
pncholy, heart-breaking as the wail Dante heard in the second&#xD;
sphere.&#xD;
"Oh, what is that ?" choruses the girls, starting to their feet.&#xD;
" That is the.tragic mews, I should say, several of them," re-&#xD;
plied Chandos, pointing to Rainbow, seated composedly under a&#xD;
pine tree beneath the hill, and listening with a stoical countenance&#xD;
to the harangue of a sable individual who was making a half-&#xD;
circle of himself in front of him, and flourishing his tail wildly in&#xD;
the circumambient air. Just as he had arrived at his peroration,&#xD;
Chandy picked up a stone and crooked his elbow to shy it at him.&#xD;
"You mustn't, that's Rainbgw," said Sabrina, staying his hand,&#xD;
and smiling over at Chris, who had risen, and stood a little'back,&#xD;
leaning absently against a rock, and plucking at the 'dried ascle-&#xD;
pias stalks.&#xD;
"A silver penny for your thoughts, Miss Goldsmith," said the&#xD;
Brandon, on purpose to make everybody turn and look., "They&#xD;
must' be such valuable ones;,'oh, that mine enemy had written a&#xD;
book.'&#xD;
As she foresaw, they allstared at poor Chris, who twisted her&#xD;
shoulders angrily, and frowned at Belle, and wished she was fur-&#xD;
ther.&#xD;
"When .I write one," said she, "I'll put you in for first villain."&#xD;
" Don't mislay your 'temper, cdear," laughed Belle, merrily.&#xD;
"Our Chris don't carry her thoughts in her hand for daws to&#xD;
peck at," said Sabrina, rising and putting her arm around Chris,&#xD;
&#xD;
who shrank away, and looked annoyed and foolish, and kept ob-&#xD;
stinate silence.&#xD;
Chandos glanced from one to another, making mental compar-&#xD;
isons. Chris caught him  at it: "There! now :he 'is-wish-&#xD;
ing he had a sister who wasn't a cow, I suppose," thought&#xD;
she, and she felt very bitter and 'unsisterly toward the handsome&#xD;
fellow.&#xD;
" Can't you air your tongue ?". he broke out atelength. :"Sabrina&#xD;
Bradshaw is talking to you. Do leave those weeds alone, and&#xD;
say something."&#xD;
Otho darted a look at Sir John, and his short upper lip curled.&#xD;
Chris saw it, and hating to be pitied, most- of all by him,she&#xD;
nerved herself to say in a clear, steady voice, ignoring Miss&#xD;
Brandon, who came close up and looked expectantly in her face,&#xD;
,as if getting ready for -a great treat, and addressing herself to her&#xD;
brother:&#xD;
"Since you develop an unexpected' desire to' hear me talk,&#xD;
Ohandos, I will tell you whatlI was thinking when I was offered&#xD;
'the prie; not because you have any right to my thoughts,' which&#xD;
are private property, but because you address' me so politely. I&#xD;
was thinking how pleasant it would be. to stay all summer.on an&#xD;
Alp, and hear the echos, and the-waterfall music, and climb about&#xD;
with an alpen .stock, and see the senerins milk  their cows, and&#xD;
heait them jodel to each other when the setting °sun glints!behind&#xD;
the pines."'&#xD;
"Oh yes," broke in Mary Ann, brightening up, delighted at&#xD;
having something to say ; "oh yes, I know about jodles;' we used&#xD;
to have a German' girl who made them for soup-she 'took sonie&#xD;
eggs, and some flour, and kneaded- them up and cut them out'ixto&#xD;
very thin, small strips, and dried them a little';' they was deli&#xD;

The girls exchanged glances, and Belle Brandon laughed con-&#xD;
temptuously.&#xD;

having made many a dinner off them."&#xD;
"You ought to be a judge of noodles, I'm sure," said Miss&#xD;
Brandon to her dear friend and foil,with a sneer.&#xD;
Chandy burst into a thoughtless laugh, not sQ  nch at the&#xD;
words as. the funny twist, she gave her handsome face ii saying&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Poor Mary. Annlooked confused, and felt snubbed , though she&#xD;
did not clearly understand bow. Otiho proposed walking on, and&#xD;
he and Chris kept by the side of the poor girl the rest of the&#xD;
way, 'and"he helped her up the rugged path, and chatted with her,&#xD;
or. rather permitted. her to chat with him, a kindness which she&#xD;
nover forgot, and which Chris had cnse afterwards to remember.&#xD;
Chris, who walked silently along, thinlug .how truly good ,ud4&#xD;
noble he.was, and how. pleasant it must be to ave such - brother,;&#xD;
and she sighed and then flushed indignantly as she glanced ,at&#xD;
handsome 'Chandy, laughing and flirting with, Belle Brandon in&#xD;
his Grand Seignoir manner. That blonds beauty was not at&#xD;
ease, either, for she could make nothing of the cool fellow who&#xD;
took her as a: mattertf course, and she got very. spiteful toward&#xD;
Sabrina and Zoe because of their easy, familiar, old-friend footing&#xD;
with the bird she wished .to bag for herself.&#xD;
It was a hard. climb, but a pleasant one, along the winding-&#xD;
path, defined byold; grayrocks, shut i with alders and dogwood.&#xD;
And the evening song of the bob-o'-link and whip-poor-will rose&#xD;
fitfully and mingled with the farm, noises below them; and the&#xD;
girls were rosy and breathless when they reached; the top, just in&#xD;
time to catch the golden glory of the slant crimson beams on tl&#xD;
forest, and the anber curtaining q f the clopd palaces, tley then&#xD;
selves standing out clear an l well-defined in the glowing light;&#xD;
charming figures in the foreground of a most charming picture.&#xD;
During the little chorus of exclamations whith ensued, dainty,&#xD;
thoughtless, spoilt Chandy went up to Chris, who stood apart&#xD;
with Qtho. and Mary Ann, acd said in a careless, good-humored,&#xD;
teazing way, which, eirely ignore4 the pos'bi ty of le, hyinu&#xD;
any feelings to hurt:&#xD;

" I say, Miss Goldsmith, is that your best toggery!? There,&#xD;
don't flare up, now ; you remind me of Beauty, the good daughter,&#xD;
who spoke pearls and diamonds. I'll hold my cap if you are&#xD;
about to utter some now."  He pushed his cap under her chin, as&#xD;
one catches water-drops from a spout.&#xD;
Chris dashed it away in a nice passion, and flashed in his face&#xD;
a scorching glance out of her great brown eyes, which Otho had'&#xD;
studied at the old wall, so meek and wistful; andtChandos wheeled&#xD;
about on his high. heels, like a ballet-master, and laughed heartily.&#xD;
Chris and her brother were, as we know, not on the best of terms.&#xD;
He, boy like, had always considered her a safe target for his wit,&#xD;
for all manner of sharp sayings and biting jokes which he dared'&#xD;
not practice on any one else ; all which she deeply resented and&#xD;
treasured up against him. His heedless way Of blurting out his&#xD;
opinions was especially offensive to her sensitive nature; and- he,&#xD;
the mirror of exactness and delicacy in toilette, (having been nice&#xD;
from a baby, as his mother boasted.) was much put out by her&#xD;
shiftless, careless, never-mind habits.&#xD;
Otho heard and saw, and a slight frown contracted his dark&#xD;
forehead, and the shadow of a secret thought passed over his face&#xD;
making it graver than ever; but he stopped the retort which he&#xD;
saw in Chris's eyes, stepping up to her 'with studied deferer ce,&#xD;
and bowing to Chandy.&#xD;
"Excuse the interruption, Mr. Goldsmith, but are not these&#xD;
sandstones a fine study?  Suppose we persuade Bertha to come&#xD;
up here to-morrow and try our artist powers upon them, for a&#xD;
second ride upon Zephyr. The trailing vines which hang so pic-&#xD;
turesquely about them;-are they- arbutus ?"&#xD;
"No," answered Chris, shortly, "it is Indian clover."'&#xD;
I wish yon-would promise to show me some arbutu , Miss&#xD;
Chris, said Otho, smiling, not at all discouraged by her discour-&#xD;
teous brevity. "I have read Rose Terry's charming poem, and&#xD;
I should like to study the inspiration."&#xD;
"Look here, Sir John Chatndos," called out Sabrina, gaily ; he'&#xD;
was standings on the edge of 'the 'mossy 'platform, from whence&#xD;
she could see the valley of Roaring River, and the distant towns,&#xD;

looking like hamlets, and the checkered fields, and the sandy-road&#xD;
winding between its lofty. pollards. " Look here, I'm going to do&#xD;
something romantic, worthy the time and place, and give you the&#xD;
opportunity to glorify your prowess and your chivalry."&#xD;
She raised her handkerchief, a delicate -bit of lace and embroi-&#xD;
dery, (Miss 'Sabrina was dainty in her handkerchiefs,) and ex-&#xD;
claimed in mock heroics:&#xD;
".-My kingdom and my mouchoir for the brave hero who shall&#xD;
dare to reclaim it from the birds, who will undoubtedly be glad to&#xD;
mince it for their nests."&#xD;
She waved it, airily held between her little thumb and fingers,&#xD;
over the precipice, her shapely head turned, and her laughing,&#xD;
mockingeyes fixed on Chandy, who made a grimace and thrust&#xD;
his hands into his pockets.&#xD;
Belle Brandon, curiously envious of Miss Bradshaw's perfect&#xD;
toilette, quite as elegant as 'her own, and so unconsciously worn,&#xD;
her assured ease and positive self-assertion, as of one superior in&#xD;
her own sphere; Miss Belle, I say, slyly twitched, the floating&#xD;
gossamer, as it might have been a breeze, and down it dropped,&#xD;
fluttering and whirling softly, till it lodged in a clump of young&#xD;
beeches, about half way down the rocks, "inmid air stayed.&#xD;
When Miss Sabrina turned her head, she was something aston-&#xD;
ished and looked rather silly at her empty fingers; she had not&#xD;
felt the loss through her glove, and she drew back the extended&#xD;
hand in haste, and leaned over the cliff, and. gazed blankly down&#xD;
where the white'itrifle lay safely provided for.&#xD;
"There's an end of my pretty mouchoir," said she, petulantly,&#xD;
vexed at her own folly. "The birds may relish the joke, but I&#xD;
must say I don't see the point.",&#xD;
"I shouldn't have thought she would have'brought such a nice&#xD;
handkerchief up here, should you?. she says it is point," remarked&#xD;
'Mary Ann, vaguely.&#xD;
"Mr. Goldsmith," said Belle, "I admire your elegant shrug,&#xD;
worthy of a Parisian, as well as honor your wisdom; discretion is&#xD;
the better part of valor ; such an exploit as this merciless young&#xD;
&#xD;
woman desires to force you into is no joke.. It would take an&#xD;
expert climber to bring back that pretty trophy."&#xD;
"I am afraid our Chandy is only a carpet knight, after all,"&#xD;
said Zoe, merrily. "He will do to, hold worsteds, and play old&#xD;
maid with the children.. Never mind, child, there are divers&#xD;
gifts."&#xD;
"'Yes, to some, tongues," replied Chandy, coloring a little.&#xD;
" Those briars and rough plces would be ruinous to primrose&#xD;
kids," said Belle, with a tantalizing laugh; "not at allithe sort of&#xD;
thing for a young gentleman who puts his whole mind upon his&#xD;
get-up. Mr. Goldsmith thinks too well of proprieties to soil his&#xD;
apparel. His -mamma told me only yesterday that her boy was&#xD;
always as dainty as a pussy-cat about getting himself tumbled."&#xD;
Handsome, reckless' Chandy turned about as if stung by a&#xD;
nettle, flushing up to his curls. He dashed off his. cap.&#xD;
"You shall see, Miss Brandon, whether or no I am a good&#xD;
climber."&#xD;
."Don't, Chandy!" exclaimed Chris, pale and trembling.&#xD;
"Stay where you are, sir!" commanded Sabrina, imperiously.&#xD;
"'.The beauteous sister imploring stands,&#xD;
With streaming eyes and clasp-ed-hands,'&#xD;
and Miss Bradshaw queens it like Zenobia, the engaging Ama-&#xD;
zon. How very romantic."   Belle's merriment was galling.&#xD;
Chandy boldly vaulted out, while she was- yet speaking, and&#xD;
catching by a sapling he swung himself clear of-the sharp rocks,&#xD;
and dropped fearlessly. down from branch= to branch with the&#xD;
agility of a squirrel, or a good gymnast, as he was, and reached&#xD;
the bit of perfumed cambric, which he kissed, with a saucy smie,&#xD;
and glanced upward at the fair owner, who stood watching him&#xD;
with compressed lips and paling cheeks ; and he bowed mockingly&#xD;
to Belle, who was also watching. him  breathlessly. Then he&#xD;
placed it with elaborate care in his breast pocket, making osten-&#xD;
tatious display of one tiny lace corner, and commenced the ascent.&#xD;
While he was yet like Shakspeare's samphire gatherer, 'on rugged&#xD;
cliff but half-way down,' a slight crackling made itself heard in&#xD;

the perfect silence, and they, listening fearfully, with bushed&#xD;
breath, heard the sapling give up. itS hold upon the perpendicular&#xD;
rock into whose crevices it had with slight encouragement thrust&#xD;
its roots, and Chandy fell with it, crashing down through the&#xD;
bieaking bushes inifrightful haste.&#xD;
Chris, who had reached the edge of the platform with a bound,.&#xD;
as her b 'other swung off, stood, her hands tightly locked together,&#xD;
her face like marble in its stillness' Belle Brandon's vexing&#xD;
rhyme, and her knocking fade effectually silenced her, after her&#xD;
first -ipulsire 'exclamations . She watched every agile motion,&#xD;
and saw the rich color mount in his cheeks, and had time to note&#xD;
how handsome he was, and then the sharp crash smote her ears,&#xD;
and the regurgitating blood .that leaped through her heart and&#xD;
made her reel, told her his peril. All the wicked thoughts she&#xD;
had cherished against him, all the rash, stormy words: she had ut-&#xD;
tered, swept over her like a wave, a surge of bitter regret, which&#xD;
rose to anguish, when she caught the swift look he sent upwards&#xD;
as he dropped fromn her sight down the fearful abyss, and the bent&#xD;
branches;swayed back, and the wild swish of the ,air they stirred&#xD;
dashed against her face ; and a couple of plovers rose and whirred-&#xD;
and wheeled over her head, and all was still. She staggered, and&#xD;
would have fallen.headlong over the rock, had not Otho, who was&#xD;
closely watchful of her, caught her in his strong arms; and held&#xD;
her fast. He carried rather than led her to a seat on the moss,&#xD;
where she sank down with a sob; and covered her face with her&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
"My poor child," said he, hurriedly; "be quiet, be brave;. I&#xD;
will givemy life for his if need be."&#xD;
She shuddered, and a couple of tears trickled through her&#xD;
finges;3 but she did not try to speak or look up. AsOtho threw&#xD;
off his coat,- he quietly motioned Sabrina to come.&#xD;
"Take care of her," said he ; "I don't think she will faint; sit&#xD;
down by-rer please, and talk."&#xD;
lie followed the: adventurous path poor Chandy had, tried wi i&#xD;
such disastrous consequences. As he passed ]ele Brandon, who&#xD;
stood alone,.plucking and tearing, the dry twigs from a Aead larch&#xD;
&#xD;
at her side, he said a few words to her, which sent the angry&#xD;
blood flashing through her hot cheeks, and caused -her to turn her&#xD;
back rudely upon him. A last look at Chris, and he fearlessly,&#xD;
carefully descended from tree to bush, clinging with his liads,&#xD;
finding footing in the crevices, bringing his trained muscles into&#xD;
full play. They watched him out of sight, and a shout told them&#xD;
he had reached Chandos ; but. his voice had a startled tremor in&#xD;
it which was not fatigue, it sounded like horror.&#xD;
Ie found the poor boy caught fast in the strong grasp of a&#xD;
grape-vine, as in a vice ; that his body was doubled, bent back-&#xD;
ward, and the tough branches twisted around his neck and chest,&#xD;
so as to stop his breath ; he was purple .and lifeless already. It&#xD;
was the work of an instant to force off the great rope of a. vine&#xD;
which compressed his chest, and raise him up ; he did it with a&#xD;
shudder, for his back might be broken, indeed it must have been&#xD;
had he not been young and supple. It required vigorous muscles&#xD;
to untwist the strong withes which held him fast as the avenging&#xD;
serpents, the Laocoon. His footing was difficult and slippery, but&#xD;
he managed to raise the drooping head, and holding it on .one&#xD;
knee, he succeeded in pulling out his knife, which he opened with&#xD;
his teeth, and while he held the branch in one hand, and kept it&#xD;
from pressing on the purple throat, he cut it, and the smaller ones&#xD;
which held the legs.. One-foot was bent beneath the body ; was&#xD;
it or was it not broken ?  I e must rest, if only for one moment.&#xD;
He glanced hurriedly around ; a little farther down he saw; a plat-&#xD;
form of rock, and laying his burden back as well as hecould on&#xD;
to the tangled and matted vines, he clambered down and found&#xD;
the spot would serve as a bed for the unconscious 15oy, ifhe could&#xD;
only manage to-get him down. He must make the attempt. He&#xD;
could toss up the ." fifty pound weights" like playthings; but he&#xD;
hesitated4  Delay might be death for one, and a failure certain&#xD;
peril for both. He had tried softly to move the twisted, limb be-&#xD;
fore descending, and he shrank involuntarily to find his handa&#xD;
dabbled in blood. It was welling from a cruel gash belothe&#xD;
knee, deep and jagged. He pulled sometender leaves ,andlaid&#xD;
them quickly and deftly on tle wound,aud tore off his cravat and&#xD;

hound: it tightly above them. Climtbing down  to the spring, he&#xD;
drank a deep draught, and dashing the cobl water over his throb.&#xD;
bing"temples, he turned resolutely back. He availed himself of&#xD;
a network of vines, a-natural ladder, to' reach the object of his&#xD;
eare, and kiiitting his brows and setting his-teeth, he took up/the&#xD;
nconscious fellow in his arms. It was but a half-dozen stagger-&#xD;
ing steps, but his veins swelled like whip-cords, and great Arops&#xD;
of sweat stood on his face, when he laid his burden safely upon&#xD;
the soft thickmoss. The poor s.dfferer groaned, ahd opened iis&#xD;
eyes for an instant, as he 'stood- over him panting.,&#xD;
"No bones broken, I think, Master Chandos," muttered he,&#xD;
both hands pressed against his heaving chest; "but you've a pur-&#xD;
ple necklace around your white throat which will last a while."&#xD;
Stooping down to the spring he filled his soft hat with the clear&#xD;
bubbling water. As he turned, he heard a fierce caterwaul, and&#xD;
hastening back, he beheld Rainbow on tiptoe, with tail tremen-&#xD;
dons, and eyes flashing green gleams, keeping watch over the un-&#xD;
conscious heap of fallen manhood, evidently suspicious of foul&#xD;
play ; and he stood his ground and growled at Otho's approach,&#xD;
and he watched every motion with feline vigilance, as he bathed&#xD;
the lifeless face, and washed the blood from the wounds, brushing&#xD;
nonchalantly off the copious sprinkles he got favored with, never&#xD;
for an instant ceasing his guard. Only a few minutes had passed,&#xD;
though they seemed like hours to the silent group ivatching and&#xD;
waiting above. Now they heard a clear firm voice shouting tp&#xD;
from below ; it sounded from rock to rock in ringing notes -like&#xD;
an alpine horn.,&#xD;
"Imast have men ; let the swiftest runner among you, and&#xD;
that's Miss Zoe, I think, put wings to her feet and speed away.&#xD;
Tell them to bring axes and cut away the bushes and get 'us'out&#xD;

Belle had stood apart, niot looking 'with the others, after the&#xD;
crash, continuing her occupation of pulling off the dead twigs and&#xD;

&#xD;
tossing-them down the abyss, while'her color fled and came, and&#xD;
hlr steely eyes looked half frightened and half defiant. She&#xD;
tore off her scarf and thrust it into Zoe's hand without a word.&#xD;
Zoe, who had been peering down, scared and white, through the-&#xD;
broken bushes, heard the ringing voice- and , darted away&#xD;
like a deer down the steep path, nor paused, in her fleet career&#xD;
till she reached a field where some men were working a - fallow.&#xD;
With scant breath she made known her wishes, and dropped pant-&#xD;
lng among the May weeds, whose pungent odor she ever after&#xD;
coupled with trouble and danger. The men hardly stopped to&#xD;
hear her through, but seizing their axes they dashed off down&#xD;
the path, rugged and steep and full of rolling stones, which led to&#xD;
Petrifying Spring, and there they scrambled down among the&#xD;
boulders, clinging to their mossy sides, and listening  for Otho's&#xD;
voice, who shouted to them from time to time. After a look at&#xD;
Chandy, lying so pale and still, and a few characteristic exclama-&#xD;
tions, they set to work with a will, hacking right and left through&#xD;
the dense thicket, and soon cleared a path across to the glen.&#xD;
That done, Otho directed.them how to raise the handsome fellow,&#xD;
and they bore him carefully over the rough'places, pushing aside&#xD;
the obtrusive vines and bushes, laboring silently and slowly, till,&#xD;
they emerged in the grassy glen, where the steady dash of Roar-&#xD;
ing River made mad music for itself in the solitude; and they&#xD;
could hear far down the noise of the mills, and the pounding of&#xD;
the trip-hammers, but it was a good mile away; and they laid&#xD;
down their burden while they debated what they should. do. The&#xD;
dew was falling fast, and the air of the glen felt damp and chilly,&#xD;
and the sun had dropped behind the pinnacle, leaving them in;sober&#xD;
shadow.&#xD;
" There is nothing for it," said Otho, "but- to bide our !time."&#xD;
He pulled off his vest and wrapped it around the bruised limb.&#xD;
"I wish I had my coat here. -Lend me your jackets, men, to&#xD;
wrap this sprained foot ; we must'nt run any chance) of' cold; we&#xD;
have enough to fight already. I think Miss Zoe will raise some-&#xD;
body. How are you Goldsmith, old fellow. Keep up, we will&#xD;
soon be out of this."&#xD;

Candy opened his eyes an instant, and shut them again with&#xD;
a heavy groan.&#xD;
"A little whisky would'nt be amiss ; but we'll pull through&#xD;
-somehow. If I had my coat here I could comfort you with a&#xD;
nice little dose. Here, rest your head on me, my boy. If help&#xD;
don't come immediately, one of you must go down to the mills;&#xD;
but I feel sure it will. I have unlimited faith in the messenger.&#xD;
have already dispatched."&#xD;
Meanwhile, as We said, little Zoe sat fanning: herself, and the&#xD;
slant sun-beams shimmered over her crimsdn dress, lighting up&#xD;
her figure like one of the little "hill-folk," whose beauty and wiles&#xD;
bewilder travelers, and whose woeful tales entice and mislead&#xD;
them to the deep earth-caves, where they have to dig and dig all&#xD;
the while;for shining jewels, and though they see the glitter of&#xD;
the diamonds and the fiery glow of the rubies, they never can&#xD;
have any for themselves. She was weeping, too; when who&#xD;
should come along in a light spring cart, drawn by a pair of sorrel&#xD;
colts, but the stalwart Peter the younger. He had in the back&#xD;
of. the cart a sub-soil plow, which he was intending to try on the&#xD;
fallow piece ; and he was humming to himself, with a merry light&#xD;
in his eyes, and his pleasant, trust-worthy face was fresh and rosy.&#xD;
I know a maiden fair to see."&#xD;
This was the burden of his song; and from the start he gave&#xD;
when he espied little Zoe, and the honest blush' which; mantled&#xD;
his cheek, it seemed almost as if she might have been in his&#xD;
thoughts. Of course he drew rein to speak to her, hoping to&#xD;

suited the" Ggpsey,' though she often pouted her lip;and ordered&#xD;
or implored him to do so. But he found her n no saucy or&#xD;
sparkling mood today. 'She rose and came forward as soon as&#xD;
she sawshim.&#xD;
"Oh Peter! I am as glad as any thing to se you.,I am glad&#xD;
you are so strong and so good. I am afraid poor Chandy Gold-&#xD;
smith is dead." And she hurriedly detailed as much as she knew&#xD;
of the accident.&#xD;
He turned the heads of the sorrel colts, and trundled out his&#xD;
plow on to the road-side, before she finished.&#xD;
"Jump up, Zoe," said he shortly. "You'll come with me; you&#xD;
can be useful. Poor Chandy! poor fellow ; never could be dared&#xD;
to do anything when he was a little sprout. Don't cry, Zoe; I&#xD;
hope 'tis not so bad. Give me, your hand-now then, spring!&#xD;
Light 'as a feather !"&#xD;
She sprang to his side, and though the light touch of her firm&#xD;
warm little hand sent the blood galloping, he paid her little more&#xD;
attention, giving his best efforts to reach the glen, putting the&#xD;
colts to their speed; and they were blood, each one of their&#xD;
pointed ears being, as Peter pore averred, Worth a hundred dol-&#xD;
lars. It required careful guiding over the rough way, and little&#xD;
Zoe was fain to cling to her escort now and then, as the light cart&#xD;
went tilting here and there ; but they reached all safe, and were&#xD;
greeted with a shout of welcome as soon as they cameo in sight.&#xD;
"Here they come ! Miss Zoe to the rescue!" exclaimed Otho,&#xD;
with a pleased approving glance at her. "I felt sure you would do&#xD;
your spiriting quickly, most dainty Ariel. You never was more&#xD;
needed in your life, Mr. ,Bradshaw, than by your friend Chandy&#xD;
at this moment. Now raise him  up, boys, under his shoulder&#xD;
blades-,careful-ease him down-there! that's it. Sit here, Miss&#xD;
Zoe. Let me place his foot on your lap; never mind the blood,"&#xD;
(seeing her start and turn-pale,) "only a flesh wound. I can&#xD;
hold him. Now Bradshaw, make your horses step on velvet."&#xD;
With his peculiar quick sedate movements and comprehens ve&#xD;
glance, he arranged every thing in the best manner, and his voice&#xD;

kept its even quiet flow, and his dark'eyes were lighted with pur-&#xD;
poseful fire, while they silently followed his directions. But so&#xD;
slowly were they forced to drive,4hat it was bright starlight when&#xD;
they reached Mrs. Goldsmith's door, and Ruth and Pigeon had&#xD;
gone home hours ago.&#xD;
CHAPTER SEVENTEENTH.&#xD;
CHRIS GETS A GLASS OF WINE.&#xD;
TTHE widow saw the men bearing in her first born and on&#xD;
son without an outcry of love or fright. With her- mouth rigid&#xD;
drawn Aown, her thin lips a purple line, and her teeth firmly s(&#xD;
she watched them lay him on her bed. Otho explained in a f&#xD;
words, and tried to' comfort her, without any marked effect, wh&#xD;
he carefully cut the boot from the sprained ankle; and she stalks&#xD;
stiffly about, with her eyes looking straight before hei, steep&#xD;
wormwood and stirring in saltpetre, and tearing bandages. S&#xD;
answered as shortly as possible when addressed, and snapped&#xD;
and bit off her replies as if the accident were a personal affro&#xD;
which she was bound to resist to the death. Her maternal a&#xD;
iety stood out all over her, like prickles on a cactus. Otho&#xD;
ranged Chandy as easily and comfortably as he could, and th&#xD;
turned quietly to the widow.&#xD;
" What physician shall I summon, madam ?"&#xD;
She looked sharply at him. "I don't know as any. I do&#xD;
like doctors myself. Sextons like 'em, because they-get a dol&#xD;
and a half for every grave they dig. Dr. Jenkins '11 come a&#xD;

to my son, yet, to see what does ail him. You've kept so dreful&#xD;
busy round him."&#xD;
"Certainly, madam. I do not doubt the profoundness of your&#xD;
skill; but there is a gash in.Iis leg which requires a little surgery,&#xD;
a few stitches are necessary. Perhaps you will trust me to sew&#xD;
it. I think I shall at any rate-time is precious.".&#xD;
"You!" she ex'claimed,.sharply, eyeing him over as he stood&#xD;
in his shirt-sleeves, specked and splashed here and there with&#xD;
Chandy's blood, and resting her gaze with particular distaste upon-&#xD;
his small white hands.&#xD;
"Yes, madam, Otho Groenveldt at your service. I belong to&#xD;
theKillall's, though I have not as yet put many 'fees into the&#xD;
sexton's pocket.'")&#xD;
Though Mrs. Goldsmith kpew perfectly well Otho's profession,&#xD;
she sniffed disgusted astonishment, as though the =announcement&#xD;
were ridiculous news to her. The young doctor drew from the&#xD;
pocket of his bloody vest, which he had tossed'On a chair,a small&#xD;
case of gleaming steel instruments,-wicked looking things, though.&#xD;
resting idly on ,a bed of crimson velvet. Calmly he selected the&#xD;
right one, entirely ignoring the widow's snorts ; he set cleverly to&#xD;
work, and in a minute it was done.&#xD;
"Now the linen, madam, if you please ; thank you, (pulling it&#xD;
out - of ;her clutch.)  What admirable bandages ! A  hospital&#xD;
nurse could not raake better. -"Now the foot next; no-I will&#xD;
wrap it myself. Steep -the flannel well. I see you are perfectly&#xD;
au fait. Dr. Pickemoff's presence would be entirely unnecessary.&#xD;
Experience, good judgment,-and motherly tenderness are worth&#xD;
everything, are they not ?"  He began to wind the foot and an-&#xD;
kle with the narrow..strips, artistically rolled, and did, his work&#xD;
dexterously and;smoothly, she watching him with astonished and&#xD;
jealous eyes, too much put about even to snuff any more. All&#xD;
which Dr. Otho saw without appearing to see, but with secret&#xD;
amusement.:&#xD;
"There," said he, when he bad quite finished, and laid the&#xD;
bruised limb carefully in a proper position, "that will' do icely,&#xD;
and of course I need not say to you, madam that it must be kept&#xD;

constantly wet. He has a scratch or. two on his head and face&#xD;
you see, and his hand is bruised also. Don't you think a little&#xD;
wormwood would be well there ? If I might venture the advice.&#xD;
Now Goldsmith, I.can report you as well as can be expected."&#xD;
Chandos smiled faintly, he was very pale yet, and the purple&#xD;
veins showed their :tracing on. his forehead, and his curls were&#xD;
matted with blood, but the mischief and fun spranginto his eyes&#xD;
as he replied in a whisper, glancing at his vest whieh hung over.&#xD;
the bedpost.&#xD;
" I've got the mouchoir, at all events."&#xD;
"And a dear trophy it is. I advise you to place it among your&#xD;
relics."&#xD;
They were all so busy making the unfortunate boy comfortable,&#xD;
that no one seemed to notice a poor, pale, exhausted girl steal up&#xD;
to the bed-foot, in the half gloom of the lowered lanps, and gaze&#xD;
with frightened dilated eyes at her brother. The widow having&#xD;
occasion to warm her wormwood, ranover her, and said--&#xD;
"Go to bed, out of the way."&#xD;
"Good night, then Miss Goldsmith."  Otho offered his hand&#xD;
with pointed politeness, as she shrank past .him. " Your brother&#xD;
is quite safe, only a few scratches, and a sprained 'ankle, which&#xD;
will need your sisterly nursing. I hope the fright and excitement&#xD;
will not make you ill. You look a ghost of the Christabel who&#xD;
so bravely scaled the mountain side this afternoon."&#xD;
" Come here, Christabel," said Chandy, in a soft voice which&#xD;
made her start, and brought the ready tears into her eyes.&#xD;
"Here is your coat, Mr. Groenveldt, it was lying on.the ground&#xD;
and I brought;it away," said she, passively holding out a black&#xD;
bundle, which she had been carrying on her arm.&#xD;
How thoughtful of you, Sappho," he answered in=a low voice,&#xD;
looking earnestly in her face. " I suppose Zoe°and Peter found&#xD;
you on the, hill. - I dispatched them. for you, as soon as we got&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"'No, I did not see them."&#xD;
" Is it possible ! Then how did you come home ? You surely&#xD;

&#xD;
hav'nt walked this long way, and in the darkness." His man-&#xD;
ner was full of earnest anxiety, and he kept her hand in his.&#xD;
"I scarcely know. Sabrina wanted to come with me, but I&#xD;
could not let her. I had to be alone. I am afraid I was--not&#xD;
polite'to her."  She passed her hand over her forehead in a tired&#xD;
way, and staggered against the bedstead, and steadied herself by,&#xD;
the post.&#xD;
"' Go to bed," repeated the widow, greatly aggravated by Otho's&#xD;
words and manner, and darting withering looks at her pale&#xD;
daughter.&#xD;
"Don't go yet," said Chandos, glancing in astonishment from&#xD;
Chris to his mother. " I want you to stay, by me."&#xD;
She roused herself instantly, and came and stood close beside&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" I thank you, my brother," said she, with a tremble in her&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
"I shouldn't have made such a tom-fool of myself if I had&#xD;
minded you, Chris. I- deserve to come to grief. Do you know&#xD;
Groenveldt ? I think it was the devilish look the Brandon shot&#xD;
at me, when she as good as called me a coward, which sent me&#xD;
over the cliff. Upon my soul, I believe she's what you call 'em,&#xD;
you know," shaking and wriggling his well arm  about sug-&#xD;
gestively.'&#xD;
"Lamia, " said Chris, in a mechanical- way, as if hardly yet&#xD;
herself..&#xD;
"That's the cheese, Chris," Chandy looked up in her still, grave&#xD;
face. "Mother, get my sister a glass of wine. She's tired to&#xD;
death, she'll be ill to a blank certainty. - She shall have attention.&#xD;
The flower of the faniily, that 'is, while I'm on the shelf."&#xD;
Sniff, sniff, and a grunt, were all the reply which the widow&#xD;
vouchsafed to this command, and she drew the cloth-so tight on&#xD;
his bruised hand as to make Master Chandy wince.&#xD;
I say, mother, ' deal gently with the erring' you know," ex-&#xD;
claimed he, pulling his hand away. "I'll wait till you've fixed&#xD;
up Chris,"before you do anything more for me.. I'm going to have&#xD;
&#xD;
her for my nurse, and I want her strong and' active, because I&#xD;
shall have to have lots of waiting bn."&#xD;
"She's got two good legs,". said the widow shortly, '"let her&#xD;
help herself,"tgiving her at the same time a look which said, "I&#xD;
should like to catch her at it."  She attempted to seize her son's&#xD;
hand and go on:with her rubbing.&#xD;
"No thank you, Chris first, if you please."..&#xD;
"' Dor't Chandos," said Chris, surprised and frightened at his&#xD;
persistence. "I don't need anything indeed."&#xD;
Otho seeing her trouble, went up to the side-board, and said,&#xD;
"Permit me, madam, to save your valuable'time," he poured&#xD;
out a glass of wine, and handed it politely to poor Chris, who&#xD;
scarcely dared to touch it, so overwhelmed with shame and con-&#xD;
fusion, was she.&#xD;
" Thank  you!   Groenveldt, Dr. Groenveldt.  You are a&#xD;
trump! I vow, I did not suppose I should like you so much.&#xD;
You see you were as silent as an owl, going up the pinnacle, and&#xD;
I beg your pardon, but I took you for a prig, never was more&#xD;
mistaken in the whole 'of my eventful career, which came mighty&#xD;
near being nipped in the bud by that old thug of 'a grape vine,&#xD;
(feeling his neck gingerly, with his well hand, and then holding&#xD;
it out to Otho,)" his hand I mean. " I-shant forget this nights'&#xD;
work in a hurry,. (his frank, merry  eyes filled with tears). I'm&#xD;
your friend for life, if you think it worth while to enter such a&#xD;
scatterbrain on your valuable list."&#xD;
"Ishall take a friend's privilege, and advise you; don't talk&#xD;
any more now, Goldsmith. Later in the small hours,"'if you are&#xD;
still irrepressible, I will listen with pleasure to -your comrmunica-&#xD;
tion, for I intend to watch with you to-night."&#xD;
"That's frisky of you, and here's. Chris, who is a perfect owl,&#xD;
(nightingale I mean,) for sitting up nights, will help you." Char-&#xD;
acteristically forgetting his anxiety about her health. " There&#xD;
mother,'that will do, don't take a fellow's scalp off;, let Chris rub&#xD;
it, her fingers are not all- bones," taking up the supple member&#xD;
and straightening it on his palm admiringly: "Avery commend&#xD;

fine and sinooth, a little brown or so, I ex'leot Ilknow how that&#xD;

is any sister. You need not sit up mother, Groenveldt and Chrs&#xD;
are going to do for me. You will oily be in the way, and you&#xD;
look as-glum. as coffins."&#xD;
"Christabel, do you hear me ? GO TO BED!" screamed' the&#xD;
widow.&#xD;
"But I-want her," called out Chandy. "I mst have her."&#xD;
Poor Chris was at her wits end; she glanced Uneasily at her&#xD;
another, and would have. gone-away directly; only that her brother&#xD;
held her fast.&#xD;
""She is'rit going to set up here all night with no young man&#xD;
unless I stay by. I wonder you aint ashamed of yourself."&#xD;
What had been only a dim idea in Chandos' mind, now be-&#xD;
camel a fixed necessity, and he raised his voice more positively&#xD;
than before. Otho, with the keen sense of humor which under-&#xD;
laid his natural gravity, enjoyed the widow's dilemma; but he inter-&#xD;
fered here, fearing.for theconsequences to his patient. w&#xD;
- Perhaps you had better .permit hinm to have his-way, muidam'&#xD;
his fever is rising, (pointing to two bright spots on his cheeks,)&#xD;
as soon as he falls asleep, Miss Goldsmith can retire. I would&#xD;
recommend you to remain in the next room, if y6u are afraid to&#xD;
comniit your daughter to my tender mei-cies. In- the mean time,&#xD;
I -am greatly indebted to her for her providence in bringing&#xD;
home my stray garment,- it stands ine in good stead now."  He&#xD;
took from his pocket a little case of phials, and dropped a few -&#xD;
drops into a wine-glass, and offered it to Chandy, who -swallowed&#xD;
it unquestioningly.&#xD;
The widow had no answer ready; so she stalked stifly about&#xD;
her preparations making all tidy for the night ; but-she felt a hard&#xD;
pang at her heart' This was her Chandos, her first born and&#xD;
only darling,:indulged and thought, about, and planned for, who&#xD;
thus carelessly preferred others to her, and was not the less bit-&#xD;
ter becausethat other was? his sister. She -scrubbed her horny&#xD;
hands together, and looked; at- them-, and; then at the softlittle&#xD;
dimpled fingers which were obeying-her willful boy's behest, and&#xD;
&#xD;
g   goei'ed at the befit head stoopiug  iei'hiafd felt that it&#xD;
was very hardlines indeed. She lit her bedoom candle, and&#xD;
sat down to "Allefn's Alarm."  Finding that insufficiehit to tran&#xD;
quilie hler iuffled feelings, she aplied herself to the "Se at&#xD;
ribulation," and sought her colcli at last With 'bitter reseitineut&#xD;
buringfwithin her.&#xD;
Theriursina proved a sinecurre, for Chandy soon sank into ,&#xD;
soft sleep, and Otho placed 'Chri in the deep window, and sat&#xD;
down beside her, and  talked in low tones, and plenty he seemed&#xD;
to find to say, though so grave atid. distant oall others.  When&#xD;
the tall clock struck twelv'e, he:said selfadenyimgly-&#xD;
"You see, Sappho, there is nothing to do, and though I find fon&#xD;
society ve 7y agreeable, I must advise yott in m quality of phy-&#xD;
sician, not to pale your roses by a longer vigil.:&#xD;
Chris -ose instantly, ble'shing scarlet, 'she had taken no riots of&#xD;
time, so interested was she in the talk and she secretly wished&#xD;
to have mnoPe of  ihat she so thoroughly enjoyed,. but after such&#xD;
remark, that of course Wias ititpossible, and with-a 'glaaee at th&#xD;
slumbering patient (who with his face in his hand, and his brown&#xD;
curls all tossed about, was enjoying real boy sleep in spite of his&#xD;
bruises,) she gave him shy "good night."&#xD;
"In Germany, which has been my home so long," said he, de-&#xD;
taining her at the door, and smiling gravely " In Germany, the&#xD;
young ladies suffer us- to kiss their hands at parting."&#xD;
"Indeed I" exclaimed she, with some archness. " But this is&#xD;
not Germany, you know. Tdo not think the custom obtains here."'&#xD;
"Poor lost America, high honors missing,&#xD;
Knows nought of smile and nod, and sweet hand-kissing.&#xD;
He looked curiously at- her. "Whence comes your couplet,&#xD;
Sappho ?" said he,'"of a truth you bring forth things new and&#xD;
old."&#xD;
" It is Dr. Wolcot's, I think, sir, in Peter Pindar."-&#xD;
" And how came you to be reading Peter Pindar, 'tis a book&#xD;
not found in ladies' work baskets, among their worsteds, a bye-&#xD;
gone satire, whose fame is dead."&#xD;

"I dare say, sir, but my Papa showed me 'the Pilgrims and&#xD;
the Peas,' and it amused me so much that I read on. I think&#xD;
the satire upon the Boswell, after 'the tour to the Hebrides, is&#xD;
very funny indeed, and the- critique upon Johnson, beginning 'i&#xD;
own I like not Johnson's turgid-style,' is true in every little word,"&#xD;
"Ah, Sappho, but he wrote twentythree odes in one year. You&#xD;
never did that in Lesbos. It will not do to start another therne&#xD;
to-night. You tempt me to-forget my duty, which is to say.-.&#xD;
Good night."                           ~&#xD;
She retreated hastily, with tingling cheeks, and thought it all&#xD;
over, the whole of her wonderful eventful day, and her veins&#xD;
thrilled with a-sense of life.&#xD;
Mr. Otho closed the door softly after her departure, and listened&#xD;
for her light foot fall on the staircase, and then with folded arms, he&#xD;
walked slowly up and down the great room, .indulging in one of&#xD;
his brown studies, which it' seemed was not altogether pleasant,&#xD;
for though he smiled sometimes, he also frowned, and, shook his&#xD;
headpas if he were battling with difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER EIG,IHTEENT..&#xD;
CHIS SITS FOR HER PICTtRE.&#xD;
It was only a bad sprain, but full of tormenting agony, which&#xD;
exhausted all Master Chandy's patience, no tremendous stock to&#xD;
be sure, and Chris' hardly left his side for the next week. No&#xD;
bandaging but her's would serve his turn, and Mrs. Goldsmith,&#xD;
after a Struggle or two, was obliged to.yield to his sharp trucculent&#xD;
humors, and pettishly uttered wishes, which sounded' like com-&#xD;
mands ; but she did it with reluctant jealous grimness, and, fought.&#xD;
out every point before succumbing. .Not that Chandy meant to&#xD;
be unkind, he simply intended to have his own way, and of that&#xD;
she could scarcely complain, for she had so taught him. Mrs.&#xD;
Goldsmith was forced to confess to herself that Chris had a light&#xD;
touch, and a pleasant carriage in the sick room, after she felt that&#xD;
it was really her place. The sewing work was banished utterly.&#xD;
The widow made a desperate effort to mix it in with the nursing&#xD;
so as to keep her daughter's hands busy, but Chandy got cross&#xD;
and fidgety, and she was forced to give up the point.&#xD;
".But they are your shirts, my son I" she exclaimed.&#xD;
"Blame the shirts 1" retorted, dutiful Chandy. "1I've got to&#xD;
have a legato stand on, shirts or no shirts., My sister shan't sew&#xD;
in-here, when I want her all the while, not if I go in;puris natu-&#xD;
ralibus, and that is the Latin for full dress, mother. 'Go bid my&#xD;
sister, when my drink is ready, she strikO upon the bell. Get&#xD;
thee to' bed."'&#xD;
"As if I was going to bed this.time of day," snorted the widow.&#xD;
"What do you mean?"&#xD;

" Ah, most literal and dearly beloved mother, it was Mac-&#xD;
beth's speech, not mine," and then naughty Chandy laughed at the&#xD;
bewildered look his mother gave him.                 -&#xD;
In spite of occasional pounces upon her, to wash the dishes or&#xD;
churn the cream, which duties Chris found to her astonishment&#xD;
went lightly and easily now these sick room days were very&#xD;
pleasant ones indeed. Chandy had plenty of visitors, after the&#xD;
first week, adpd regular leyes, and Was particular about his&#xD;
toilette and surroundings, and insisted upon-having the fresh flow-&#xD;
ers, which were daily lavished uppn him, arranged and rearranged&#xD;
under his supervision, half a dozen- times before he was suited.&#xD;
The old oak-room was a famous gathering place. Bertha Groen.&#xD;
veldt got her introduction there, as Chandos hiyswathed in flan-&#xD;
iels, and redolent of rum and wormwood, and they chatted rarely&#xD;
together.'. Sabrina Bradshaw and Zoe Walsingham strolled in:of&#xD;
afternoons to visit their old playfellow, and brought their gay&#xD;
worsteds, and interminable afghan-strips, and Belle Brandon got&#xD;
the entree, and came -sometimes with, and oftener. without her&#xD;
foil, whom she drew on and off like a loose glove. She found-it&#xD;
worth her while to be intimate with the wooden. image, who had&#xD;
such a handsome brother, and whose house was just now the cen-&#xD;
tre of attraction, and she exerted herself for the time to blot out&#xD;
any disagreeable impressions she had made upon Chris, who&#xD;
ceased to be afraid of her, though she never became communicative&#xD;
or confidential. Otho steadily shared Chris' cares, as if they were&#xD;
his own, and the widow had got to endure him; she could not help&#xD;
it he was upright and firm, and so wvise and kind in his-treatment&#xD;
of her wayward boy: the one 'being in the whole world upon&#xD;
whom she doted. Eve' since the first night's watching, she had&#xD;
left off-little by little to impose obstacles to the friendly relations&#xD;
between the Dr. and her young daughter, not because she enjoyed&#xD;
seeing them together, very far from it, but because she could not&#xD;
help herself. Chandy having, as she !said, "got his back up," and&#xD;
Otho was so cool and grave, and persistent, that she could ;ralke&#xD;

stayed away, and she and Otho shared the onerous. 4uty of keep&#xD;

ing the exacting patient amused, and the Dr. talked as only -e.&#xD;
could do, with such delicate handling of his subjects and so rarely&#xD;
playful in his subtile wit, which had a quaint flavor, as intangibe&#xD;
and as sweet as the perfume of the Pansey. His tales .f Ger-'&#xD;
man student life always held them captive.&#xD;
"I must go there," said Chandos, when Leipsic had been the&#xD;
theme. " I must do some of those things, myself. What, if I&#xD;
should take you, Chris ?&#xD;
"What, indeed !' said Chris, with sparkling eyes. "I could&#xD;
patch and dare for you."&#xD;
lie held out his hand to her with the air of a monarch, extend-&#xD;

"Patch and darn for me, no ; thanks, not any.- 1y the way,'&#xD;
turning to the widow, " why don't my sister have some decent&#xD;
clothes? -I'm tired to death of these old things 'she wears. I&#xD;
supposed- she would come out in something gay on Sunday, and&#xD;
by George, if she did'nt creep in here in an old black contrivance&#xD;
that I know must have done duty at grandmother's funeral."&#xD;
" Sating! twelve and sixpence a yard," interpolated Mrs. Gold-&#xD;
smith, indignantly.&#xD;
"I declare its an outrage," continued Chandy, working him-&#xD;
self into a fume, and entirely ignoring the information.  "A&#xD;
blamed outrage ! Christabel has got to have dresses andthings&#xD;
like other folks, or there'll be a fuss in the family.&#xD;
"Here's Sabrina and Zoe, and the Brandon come sailing into this&#xD;
dingy old room, as elegant as butterflies, and myfsister, who ought&#xD;
to queen it over the whole of them, goes shying about, as dowdy&#xD;
as a cinder-wench. I'n blessed if I'll stand it. Im ashamed tpQ&#xD;
look at her.  If you don't fix her up, I'll take to.drinking.&#xD;
Good gracious ! how my foot aches! I'd as lief shuffle off now&#xD;
as any time."&#xD;
Chandy never stopped to calculate what opinion Otho might&#xD;
entertain of their family politics, though Chris fidgeted and&#xD;
colored and tried to stop him. The Dr. 'seemed howevernot to&#xD;
hear the talk; he sat with his back to them, and went'on. calmly&#xD;

&#xD;
working among his flies, and Chandy had to call out to him twice&#xD;
that his foot ached, before he rose to adjust the bandage. The&#xD;
Widow found that, she must ; go to the garden directly to cut the&#xD;
asparagus, and Master Chandy subsided for thetime into a series&#xD;
of growls and threatening quotations from, his favorite Bill Shakes.&#xD;
It occasionally happened that he had nothing better to do than&#xD;
to watch his sister moving about the room, fulfilling his thousand&#xD;
and one behests. If for a moment she got seated, he was sure to&#xD;
want something, and he opened his eyes with positive wonder in&#xD;
beholding the easy grace of her attitudes, when she supposed her-&#xD;
self unobserved.  She seemed to, dawn on him like a vision.&#xD;
"-Chris,' said' he one day,' when the widow was at: the female&#xD;
prayer meeting, and only she and Otho were with him, (she sat&#xD;
on the bed edge, bathing his lame hand, which would stay swelled,)&#xD;
"Chris, how handsome you are getting ! upon my ;word, with-&#xD;
out consulting your elder, and better, you are taking the liberty&#xD;
to be very lovely indeed. I always felt as if my sister ought to&#xD;
be ,a beauty."  Chris raised her eyes quickly. She wondered if&#xD;
be remembered the time. when he had so provokingly said, 'I&#xD;
Wish I had ,a sister .who was'nt a cow.' "But somehow I never&#xD;
thought-well hang it. Chris, we have lived so much apart these&#xD;
five years, I 'hav'nt had time or. opportunity, you see.",&#xD;
Chris's color rose, but she went on dipping the sponge in the&#xD;
cool water and softly applying it, with a soothing touch, which&#xD;
had magnetism in it. She could not help glancingat Otho, who&#xD;
wound'his reel with methodical exactness, and grave, quiet face.&#xD;
These unconscious revelations which thoughtless Chandy was con-&#xD;
tinually making of the inferior and subordinate position she occu-&#xD;
pied in the family were mortifying and distressing 'to her;beyond&#xD;
measure..&#xD;
. There goes my sleeve-button! called out Chandos, impatient-&#xD;
ly; "rolled-away under the bed, of course. Why don't you pick&#xD;
it up, Chris ?. you ought to have seen it going."&#xD;
She stooped to comply, and as she did soy, her net, which, as&#xD;
usual,"was too hastily put on and ill secured, slipped off, and down&#xD;
tumbled her heavy curls over her shoulders. She blushed, as if.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

e&#xD;
&#xD;
convicted of a crime, and expected, a. fire of ridicule, and drop-'&#xD;
ping the sponge she hurriedly gathered the shining mass together.&#xD;
and was about to twist. it up again, when her brother caught a&#xD;
curl in his hand.&#xD;
" Look, Otho; is not this a study for a painter?"&#xD;
"Very heavy, certainly," replied Otho, glancing at the dishev-&#xD;
eled head a moment, and then going on with his work.&#xD;
"Heavy ! If that's all you have to say, I haven't much opin,&#xD;
ion of your taste ; but such a sober, old fellow as you can't be'&#xD;
expected to be a judge of female beauty.. If it was a skeleton&#xD;
now, or a tumor, or a three-headed baby, you would be wide-&#xD;
awake and enthusiastic, I dare say. Chris, I must sketch you&#xD;
directly; run quick, and fetch my crayons, and my rubbers, and&#xD;
some bristol-board-or no, not you, Otho, shall go ; I am afraid&#xD;
she will spoil her head if she goes running up and down 'tairs;&#xD;
I must have every hair just exactly as it is now. Hold your&#xD;
head still, Chris, do, can't you?"&#xD;
Otho patiently laid down the tangled line, and soon returned&#xD;
with all the needed articles. Poor Christabel sat motionless, for&#xD;
Chandy nearly snapped her head off when she stirred, and he&#xD;
worked furiously while the humor lasted.&#xD;
" How lucky it was not my right hand which was hurt, then I&#xD;
couldnot have made this- picture of you. - It is going to be fine,&#xD;
I can tell you. Now the mouth ; yes, smile, just so; lovely!&#xD;
glorious!'e 'There's daggers in men's smiles,' Chris. I've got it!I&#xD;
Eureka-!:eureka!"&#xD;
He threw down, his, pencil and held up the sketch exultingly&#xD;
"Beautiful, isn't it ?'"&#xD;
" Very," said Chris, drily. " The. only question is about the&#xD;
likeness."&#xD;
" Likeness ! I should say that yvas about perfect. There is no&#xD;
longer any '4oubt that you are beautiful enough to be my sister ;&#xD;
an4 give me the credit of finding it out. You have not been too&#xD;
nueh be-praised, Ibelieve."&#xD;
"My vanity died of hunger:before I can remember;" answered&#xD;
she,: metrily, "but I cannot tell how much I like to heartyou&#xD;

speak well of my face, Chandos.   Your sketch is certainly&#xD;
clever."&#xD;
" Come, Otho, can't you spare time to look at my work ?"&#xD;
Otho rose, took the ,sketch from the impatient boy, and exam-&#xD;
ined it attentively.&#xD;
"Very clever indeed, Chandos ; -you have genius. If your&#xD;
talents were not so versatile as to make it difficult to settle to hard&#xD;
work, I should say you were meant for a painter."&#xD;
Having delivered his opinion, he handed back the picture&#xD;
gravely, and returned to his reel.&#xD;
"It is odd how this line got insuch a horrible muss," said he.&#xD;
" You do not think it like me, I perceive," spoke up Chris, with&#xD;
heightened color: "not that it matters in the least whether it is&#xD;
or no, except as, a test of Chandy's skill."&#xD;
"Of course not," replied Otho, with a queer smile. "Poor,&#xD;
hungry vanity."&#xD;
" The fact is,",said Chandos, who had been following out his&#xD;
own thoughts ; " the fact is, and I don't mind confessing it, I can-&#xD;
not think where all my senses have been; but I don't believe&#xD;
boys ever set much store by their sisters ;. do you, Otho ?"&#xD;
"I do by mine, at all events, if Iam a boy."&#xD;
"Well, they always feel ashamed to talk about them at school;&#xD;
only muffs and Miss Nancys do that. But we will be good friends&#xD;
from thisout, won't we, Chris?  I am afraid I must own to being&#xD;
a very selfish,good-for-nothing fellow, but I'm going to turn over&#xD;
a new leaf. I've been thinking about it, OthQ ; I'd as soon you'd&#xD;
hear me say so as 'not. You saved my life, kand you seem, just&#xD;
like one of us."&#xD;
For full five minutes Chandy looked earnest and thoughtful;_&#xD;
then he twisted himself over with a light laugh, and called for his&#xD;
supper.&#xD;
"Here, Chris," said he, holding out the sketch, " you may have&#xD;
this to give to your first lover ; or no, I'll keep it to paint from; I&#xD;
might sketch a hundred and not please myself so well as I have&#xD;
done to-day. And now be.quick ; 'stay not upon the order of your&#xD;
going,'" he added impatiently, pointingto the door, "'but go at&#xD;
&#xD;
once.' A bit of steak rare, and no gravy, or' one of, those trout&#xD;
which Otho brought from Basswood Pond this morning. I had&#xD;
fish yesterday; I'll. have the frogs' legs Deb sent me, good old&#xD;
soul; I'll eat them to please her. Fry me some potatoes, Chris,&#xD;
thin as wafers ; 'let them not vary in the estimation of a hair;' and&#xD;
a couple of' artichokes. I don't know, after all, but I'd rather&#xD;
have the trout. I, wish I could go fishing myself; I'm confound-&#xD;
edly tired of this dingy, musty old place. I know every crack in&#xD;
the wall, I've counted the panes of glass in twos and threes, up&#xD;
and down, and across and slantwise. I thought yesterday I'd got&#xD;
something new ; there was a spider's web up in the corner, with&#xD;
a bug in it, and every little while the hairy old wretch of an arach-&#xD;
nid made a dab at him, but mother saw me looking up, and just&#xD;
as he was getting interesting, and before t could sing out, she&#xD;
had whisked the whole thing down."&#xD;
Between the bed and the door he called Chris back five times,&#xD;
to give her fresh orders about his repast, each time bidding her&#xD;
" make haste."  At last she 'got away from him, and running up&#xD;
to her room," she threw herself upon her knees before the bed,&#xD;
and for the first time in years she felt a gush of real warm'love&#xD;
for her brother, and she welcomed it with tears of joy. -He had&#xD;
stood so in her way, and been always put before her,-and beyond&#xD;
her, and she was so ignored and trampled upon in ill 'her mother's&#xD;
plans.: It was the old story of the favorite child over again: "Is&#xD;
that you, darling ?"  "No,.mother, it is- only me."  There 'is a&#xD;
life's sorrow in that question and answer, and .poor Chris knew&#xD;
well what it was to be. " only me."" How could she help a'little&#xD;
bitterness springing up in her sore heart,.against this careless; for.-&#xD;
tunate fellow who so coolly took away her birth-right. 'A few&#xD;
kind wordshad swept it. all away, the bitterness 'and 'the anger,&#xD;
and she felt as she covered her face in thankfulness, that she really&#xD;
had a brother--a true friend. In the delightful glow of the new&#xD;
sensation 'she was ,ready to sink self, forget the past, and 'hope and&#xD;
believe everything .for the future. Oh, yes, she coldd sacrifice&#xD;
her wishes to him, and be his humble friend,. (he'w~ a lordly,&#xD;
handsome fellow, and highly gifted, too,) and contented to 'shine&#xD;

in his reflected light; he- should never know how she had cried&#xD;
herself to sleep in lonely discouragement, while he had been go.&#xD;
ing hither and thither,:enjoying his, leisure. "Though I don't&#xD;
know but 11ought to:confess to him how I have wished all manner&#xD;
of' wicked things to him, now that he has been so candid to me.&#xD;
Well,-I will give up my will now in good earnest," (so she re--&#xD;
solved,) "and- will try very hard to be satisfied with my life.&#xD;
Ruth ia right after-alt; here I have. been saying 'God has forgot-&#xD;
ten the world,' and- instead of punishing me. he has turned my&#xD;
brother's heart towards me, so- that I have found favor in his&#xD;
sight."  And she breathed a prayer for forgiveness and- strength,&#xD;
and ran down to the kitchen with her soul all aglow under the&#xD;
new emotion. Had her consciousness been fully awakened, or&#xD;
her opinion of herself less. humble, she might have had other&#xD;
human help to strengthen her resolves; as it was, she was truly&#xD;
thankful to have gotten some friendship into her lonely life, and&#xD;
she returned to: Chandy's side with the savory meal neatly pre-&#xD;
pared, and a peaceful smile curving her lips.&#xD;
When the invalid got well enough to walk about, he leaned on&#xD;
his sister's arm, thrown fondly around him. When. she seated herself&#xD;
upon the old-fashioned sofa, he laid his head in her lap, and look-&#xD;
e4 up in her face while she talked. She had found her tongue;&#xD;
he had no need toiell her to air it now, and she could talk with&#xD;
him by the hour ; and Sir John perceived- a new attractiori--not&#xD;
only were her clear, low tones silvery sweet, but she could speak&#xD;
well of what he knew, and tell him many things he did not know.&#xD;
She brought' down her sketches, after some persuasion, and was&#xD;
truly pleased when he praised them in his'Grand Seignor man-&#xD;
rer; offering to. take her in hand, and correct her faults; and he&#xD;
brought a ,flood of crimson to her cheeks, as. with a gay laugh he&#xD;
placed his fingers upon a sketch of the old wall, and Otho lean*,&#xD;
ing against it, dressed in alpine costume, as she imagined it. -The,&#xD;

and attitude were unmistakable. With secret exultation Otho&#xD;

Chandos 'hindered the necessity for a reply "b. saying, mis -&#xD;
chievously:&#xD;
"If you set store by -that fellow, Chris, I will paint-him in oils.&#xD;
He looks strangely familiar. I;know the shape tof -his leg;,-'this&#xD;
is his hand; his foot mercurial; his martial thigh, his j-ovial face.&#xD;
Murder in heaven ! that such an Apollo'should-peddle pills 1"&#xD;
Chris, without daring to look at-Otho, snatched the sketch from&#xD;
his hand, and placed it quickly in her portfolio; 'and gathering up&#xD;
the rest of the scattered papers, she ran off with: them  to her&#xD;
room; and she heard her brother's teazing laugh, so full of mali-&#xD;
cious enjoyment,.and wondered how Otho could bear it.&#xD;
Chandos got fon4 in these days of quiet chatting, of going off&#xD;
into dreams of the pleasure 'he should take in Christabel's beauty&#xD;
and talents, and sketched 'his programmes 'with lavish promise,&#xD;
and intense satisfaction to himself; but-once in a while .he would&#xD;
stop suddenly and fix his eyes upon a missing button 'or a zig-zag&#xD;
'tear,'or some blemish in her apparel; -something Chris had firmly&#xD;
intended to repair, and hadn't ; and then he would -blurt out a&#xD;
speech so exceedingly cutting on her careless ways,:that Chris&#xD;
would either blaze up at- himt, or withdraw from his neighborhood&#xD;
and become dumb, and the old tired, 'wistful look "would steal into&#xD;
her eyes, and the sad desolateness brood over her heart:;'and then&#xD;
the widow would click her needles in - grim enjoyment, and intro-&#xD;
duce scathing comments intended to intensify the situation, for&#xD;
which she got small thanks from her, hopeful son, who would sud-&#xD;
denly chop about . and speak -up for Chris, and put the old lady&#xD;
down with a quibble or-a quotation from his friend Bill -Shakes,&#xD;
,so ludicrously distorted and lugged away from its context .as to&#xD;
tickle Chris in spite of herself, and bring back :her -smile again.&#xD;
You see they could not come right all at once, ' but she was a&#xD;
treasure to him in those days of convalescence, and they got in&#xD;
better harmony with every passing hour. 1He- used to discuss her&#xD;
good looks with Otho, if that could be called discussion where the&#xD;
talk was all on one side ; and she unconsciously revealed to the&#xD;
two the purity and richness of her character, in its mixture of&#xD;
childish simplicity and rare cultivation. She had lived more since&#xD;

294:       WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
we met her at Ruth Blair's than in the whole five years before,&#xD;
and these weeks were the fullest and best of all. Otho went and&#xD;
crime like one -of them, and Chris began to study his face for ap.&#xD;
probation, and to lean upon him for assistance ; his cool, quiet&#xD;
gravity-made. him seem ever so many years her senior, and she&#xD;
received his opinions with respect, and unconsciously made him&#xD;
her standard for judging manhood. She fitfully combatted her&#xD;
careless habits, but with only indifferent success. When forced to&#xD;
compare her personal appearance with the others she felt ready to&#xD;
-sink into shadow ; but the pressure off, her thoughts would get lost&#xD;
in some rambling speculation, or absorbed in her sick-room duties,&#xD;
and her, own identity passed completely out of her mind. It was&#xD;
too much for her patience to go through thorough repairs of her&#xD;
wardrobe,' even if she had had the time. When .Ruth mildly&#xD;
suggested to the widow that poor Chris needed some stitches taken&#xD;
for her,-as she was so very busy, the loving matron replied that&#xD;
she might take it out in needing; if girls couldn't fix up them-&#xD;
selves they was pretty poor trash. She never had nobody to&#xD;
sprig tip her duds, and she wasn't going to spend the time loaned&#xD;
to her to prepare for dyin' in, in no hifalutin folderols."&#xD;
While Chris was dressing in her hurried way, pulling on her&#xD;
shoes, and' putting up her hair, jerking herself into her dress, and&#xD;
trying to accomplish it all at once, she did sometimes sigh for&#xD;
'really nice clothes, whole and appropriate, comely in fashion and&#xD;
becoming in color, feeling sure she should take great comfort in&#xD;
keeping them beautifully; and then she would give:her bureau a&#xD;
fresh overturn to bring up the garments nearest to whole to make'&#xD;
do for the present, intending to be very industrious in mending at&#xD;
some future period.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER NINETEENTH.&#xD;
C HANDY- DEMANDS MUSIC, AND GETS NONE.&#xD;
ONE evening they were sitting in the gloaming, which the&#xD;
widow liked to prolong-as much as possible, to save candles. ,She&#xD;
was knitting, and Chris still held the book in her hand from which&#xD;
she had been reading aloud to Chandos. 'She was gazing intently&#xD;
upon a picture she saw in the coals, for the night had -come on&#xD;
cool, and Chandy's foot always pained him if he got chilly,; so&#xD;
they had a wood fire upon the hearth. Many, weeks had -passed,&#xD;
and he was still a prisoner. The flesh-wounds in his leg were&#xD;
quite healed, thanks to his healthy young blood, but the sprain&#xD;
was obstinate-; in fact the impatient youngster would not give it&#xD;
time to become sound, but was continually trying it, like the boy&#xD;
who pulled up his onions every morning to see if they had taken&#xD;
root. He made Chris suffer sometimes by blurting out remarks&#xD;
to his mother on her treatment of her, and by asking unfortunate&#xD;
'questions; all which the widow resented, and. visited; upon' her&#xD;
daughter, as if she were to blame, in a hundred spiteful little&#xD;
ways, which evinced her ingenuity if not her. christianity. So&#xD;
that when Chandos said suddenly:&#xD;
" Chris, how is it that I haven't heard you sing a note since I&#xD;
got home ? You and I sang when we were children, and choice&#xD;
and rare were papa's selections for us.' I shall reverence Mozart&#xD;
all my life for the introduction I got to his masses in those days."&#xD;
She started and blushed, and glanced in her usual frightened&#xD;
way at her mother, who sat stiff and prim as a gridiron in the&#xD;

chimney-corner, and muttering something about fetching more&#xD;
wood, she rose to hurry out of the room..&#xD;
"Hold on, Miss Goldsmith, not so fast, if you please;. I like to&#xD;
have my questions answered.""&#xD;
" Certainly, Chandos ;" Chris paused irresolutely, and tried to&#xD;
speak in an unconstrained way. " Certainly, Sir John; ' words,&#xD;
are motes of thought, and nothing more;' I'll give you as many&#xD;
as you like."&#xD;
"Very well, then let us have them. What is there about the&#xD;
singing business which makes you color up so, and look at mother&#xD;
like a frightened deer ?"&#xD;
"Make it gazelle, Chandos; more poetical, sounds better; not&#xD;
that I am aware of looking particularly scared."&#xD;
"Yes you do, by George ; you flutter like a hurt pigeon."&#xD;
"I thank you-for the hint, and I shall immediately begin to&#xD;
cultivate ;repose of manner, as Miss Dulcet says. As to singing,&#xD;
you have not asked me'; Imust be urged; besides I have had no&#xD;
singing days of late ; and really, :Chandos, you nay as well; know&#xD;
the truth," she threw back her head and looked proud and defiant,&#xD;
"I never do sing except at Ruth's, when they make me take part&#xD;
in a duet or trio. They have so much musicover there,; Ruth's&#xD;
voice is as true as a bird's, and George has got such a tenor."&#xD;
"Ah yes, Mrs. Blair; do you, know I had. forgotton that little&#xD;
Ruth Ashmead was married till she came in with that youngster&#xD;
of hers. Time brings changes; I'm  getting old. I'll engage&#xD;
she's a gay little matron;.I nust do her the -honor of a'call, as&#xD;
Deacon Williams 'told mother yesterday.. I used to think she was&#xD;
quite a beautybut .I was a boy then. Now look, I had no idea&#xD;
there was so much warmth in;a moustache; 'positively mine is&#xD;
getting oppressive.".&#xD;
'Chris's-thoughts were running on Ruth, and she lost the last&#xD;
pa't  'Chandy's speech, as well as the flourishing caress he gave&#xD;
they-silken down which Was 'beginning to shade his merry mouth.&#xD;
Sh 'is mny dear':friend; I don't think:I could have got on at&#xD;
all Without' her. She knows, how to .scold without hurting; she's&#xD;
a soft, tender, loving christian.. I wonder what has changed'her&#xD;
&#xD;
face so of late; she does not look so gay or speak so blithe asishe_&#xD;
used, and her hymns are all sad.fones; but when I ask her, she&#xD;
will always say ''Tis nothing."&#xD;
Chris had sunk back into, her chair, and was givingroice' to&#xD;
her fears, forgetting' who listened, and she started and dropped&#xD;
her book, when the- fore-stick parted and dashed out a shower'tof .&#xD;
sparks at her.&#xD;
"I do hope you are not going to be nervous, Chris ; I hate&#xD;
nervousness."  Then he turned impatiently upon his mother:&#xD;
" Oh dear, what a tiresome noise that knitting makes ; I wish&#xD;
you had a little young America in you, mother, and would:lay off&#xD;
once in a while, and enjoy yourself. You sit up. so straight, you&#xD;
make my back ache ; and that confounded.click-clack--I'd as lief&#xD;
be a telegraph, and have dispatches running over my back all. the&#xD;
while."&#xD;
" Fiddle-sticks !" ejaculated the widow, but she folded up her&#xD;
stocking, nevertheless.&#xD;
" Now we will return to our muttons. Just open the library&#xD;
door and sit down to your piano and play me something, I shall&#xD;
be well enough to go in there myself in a day or two, and then&#xD;
we'll have some jolly duets. I haven't' seen the dear, old place,&#xD;
yet ; I believe I'll go in now.. Come, Chris, give me my cane,&#xD;
and your arm."&#xD;
Instead of rising -with her usual alacrity, Chris kept her place,&#xD;
and threw another frightened look at her mother.&#xD;
"It is cold in there, Chanos," said she; "the room has not&#xD;
been opened of late, and I am sure youa ought not to go in to-&#xD;
night; to-morrow, if mother will give me the key, I will let in&#xD;
the sunshine, and then-"&#xD;
" What a capital housekeeper you are, mother ; I've. got a&#xD;
stunning story on you about it. 'Zoe says that Deacon Williams&#xD;
was going past one day and he saw you skipping: about,:and he&#xD;
thought you was dancing, and he came up on tip-toe and peeped&#xD;

dared to intrude into your parlor ; so I suppose you keep the&#xD;
doorlocked ever since. Well never mind, Chris, I won't go in&#xD;
to-night; mother might get after me with her besom."&#xD;
Chandy gave up the more readily, because of a sharp pain in&#xD;
his foot on putting it to the floor, and he sank back. " But at,&#xD;
any rate you shall play for me; I won't be done c it of that."&#xD;
"I cannot oblige you, Chandos ; I have no piano."&#xD;
"What-! :no piano! What has gone with it ?"&#xD;
"I have sold the intrument, my son," said the widow, sourly,&#xD;
looking holy -daggers at Chris. " I had good and sufficient reasons,&#xD;
for doing it."&#xD;
" Oh, I see, very proper ; getting tinny I suppose, or as.the ma-&#xD;
kers say, ' brilliant.' Well, you have done right, a piano ought&#xD;
to be new once in five years or so; there are such lots of im-&#xD;
provements going on all the while. We will go together, Chris,&#xD;
and choose one, just as soon as you've your new toggery, and&#xD;
I've the use of my legs. We'll have a parlor-grand Steinway,&#xD;
and a master from Toptown for you."&#xD;
-    " No you won't have nary one," spoke-up the widow, bristling&#xD;
all over with anger and alarm. " You beat all, I declare !"&#xD;
"Yes but we will, though," replied Chandy, winking at Chris,&#xD;
and enjoying his mother's perturbation. "I do believe you think&#xD;
what now you speak, but what we do determine oft we break.'&#xD;
There's pleasure in store for you, mother, for'Chris and I will&#xD;
discourse you most excellent music, more exquisite than all the&#xD;
notes of nightingales and. thrushes throats. Is there a heart that&#xD;
music cannot melt ? Alas ! how, rugged is that heart forlorn.' '&#xD;
Chris followed his words in wonder ; he matched together his&#xD;
quotations so easily, from authors so diverse.&#xD;
The widow did not seem to share her pleasure.&#xD;
"My son, listen to reason," said she. "There is something more&#xD;
important to do in this sinful world than thumming ona pianoforty,&#xD;
.-that is for girls. I don't say anything against your violin. You&#xD;
know I never did. If I was asked for my opinion, (which I never&#xD;
was,) I should say it squeaked. The devil makes, great use on't&#xD;
too, when he gets fools to prance round on their toes to the jiging&#xD;

lo,&#xD;
&#xD;
on't, but your father would get you one, and you've got it and'that's&#xD;
enough. You need'nt go to puttin no nonsense into Christabel's&#xD;
head. I can't afford to let her fool away'no money, at any rate&#xD;
till you're through college. I'm sure you need'nt complain. I let&#xD;
you have everything you want, don't I ?"&#xD;
She had miscalculated for once in her argument, and misjudged&#xD;
her son.&#xD;
"Mother," said he, raising himself with.some dignity, and look-&#xD;
ing fixedly in her face, "Mother, are we so straightened in our&#xD;
means that you find it necessary to limit my sister and make, her&#xD;
suffer, that I may be supplied? If that is the case, I shall leave&#xD;
school directly, and earn my living. I could not go to college at&#xD;
that price."&#xD;
"Oh no, my son, not strictly speaking, that is not the case, but&#xD;
I think it a christian duty to practice economy, and I strive to&#xD;
bring up Christabel to industrious habits."  She knew he was&#xD;
capable of taking such a resolution, and trying it on, in spite of&#xD;
her. " I should'nt suppose," she added in a querulous tone," that&#xD;
you would find fault with my saving, it is all for you. I am&#xD;
continally contrivin how to hand over the property to you as&#xD;
large as.I can, rakin and scrapin. I want you to own that Nook&#xD;
farm. It jines ours so pat, it orto belong to it. It is a tough&#xD;
dose to guttle down your fault finding ; men are a thankless lot,&#xD;
the whole on em, but I've got my religion to comfort me. There&#xD;
is a great day a coming, when the wheat will be sifted."&#xD;
Chandos threw himself back, and lay looking gloomily at the&#xD;
fire for some time, as if straightening out -a twisted thought, then&#xD;
turning to Chris who had her eyes fixed on him, he made her&#xD;
jump again by asking-&#xD;
" Is it vacation in your school now, that you happen to be at'&#xD;
liberty,-or are you staying at home to nurse me like a good&#xD;
pretty girl as you are ? How lurchy you will get with your les-&#xD;
sons. - You must bring.home your books, and I'll help you catch&#xD;

and I say Chris, I know Botany and1Chemistry, and th it lot from&#xD;
A to izzard; come, run up and fetch, your books, and show me&#xD;
where you are. I feel just like it. It will, pass off the time.&#xD;
Il go round to the school just as soon as I get out. I suppose&#xD;
Sabrina and Zoe go where you do.",&#xD;
"I do not attend school," said Chris, in. a low hesitating tone,&#xD;
her color deepening, and a great something rising in her throat and&#xD;
choking her. " I thought you knew, Chandy, that I never had&#xD;
a day at school in my life."&#xD;
"What!" screamed Chandos, "not attendschool ! Why not,.&#xD;
pray. Come, out with it. What does this mean. I will know,&#xD;
a confounded fine lot of going's on. My sister, no piano, no edu-&#xD;
cation, no clothes ! - I've been suspecting for some time that there&#xD;
was a screw loose in this family, now I'm sure of it."&#xD;
"I study at home, that isI do sometimes," stammered Chris&#xD;
hurriedly.' " I don't, care about- going to school now, Chandos,"&#xD;
she added, looking full at her mother. " I've done with all that,&#xD;
and don't intend to rake it up again. But Chandy, you must try&#xD;
to make the best of me you can, just as-I am, I would have&#xD;
been more if I had been able. -I don't think I could bear -to have&#xD;
you despise me now, after I have felt how good and nice you can&#xD;
be. I walked such a weary, lonely road before you came up that&#xD;
day and began to talk. You did'nt make your opening speeches&#xD;
too flattering. You made it up afterwards, and I love you,"&#xD;
obeying a sudden impulse, Chris seized her brother's hand and put&#xD;
it to her lips.-&#xD;
The widow's eyes actually looked green in the haf'gloom, so&#xD;
angrily did she observe her two children.&#xD;
A silken rustle in the passage, and a low knock at the parlor&#xD;
door announced an arrival, and Chris sprang to open it, half&#xD;
ashamed of her fond- action, and thankful for the interruption.&#xD;
Though she liked very much the new championship and-good&#xD;
natured espousal of her cause by her handsome brother, albeit it&#xD;
proceeded somewhat from the "my, sister" feeling.- She hated&#xD;
the scenes" she foresaw would come to be more, and more frequent&#xD;
because of them. Twice or thrice Mrs. Goldsmith and "my son"&#xD;
&#xD;
300&#xD;
&#xD;
had had it out, already, and with doubt as- to the victor, and they&#xD;
had -a very fierce occasion shortly after;this.. conversation. When&#xD;
he ascertained that the library had been kept lockedso as .to pre-&#xD;
vent Chris from reading, his indignation knew no bounds, and he&#xD;
was so hard on the widow that she retired and read. twelve pages&#xD;
of the Great Tribulation, and there is: no saying how bitter her&#xD;
meditations 'were. Chris had reason to know, however, though she&#xD;
bathed her ved ears and pulled her hair down over them so. that&#xD;
they escaped notice.&#xD;
The dutiful young gentleman, Sir John Chandos, though he was&#xD;
diverted from his inquiries for the evening, did not banish them&#xD;
from his thoughts. He took early opportunity, to question Chris,&#xD;
and drew from her reluctant lips the whole history, of her' strug-&#xD;
gles and trials, and he half guessed her victory. As we know,&#xD;
Master Chandy had been for long a school boy, and.with his hap-&#xD;
py-go-lucky temperament, he had made a home-for himself among&#xD;
his schoolfellows,- entering heart and soul into school politics,, and&#xD;
school scrapes ; often spending his vacations with .one or the other&#xD;
of his friends, a welcome guest everywhere. Of course it never&#xD;
occurred - to him that all was not as it should .be: at home, His&#xD;
sister was but a target to shoot his jokes at, for which-he got. his&#xD;
ears well boxed sometimes. 'Mostly however, Chris. kept .out of&#xD;
the youngster's way when he was at Roaring River, watching&#xD;
him afar off, resenting with. bitter' anger his easy comings, and&#xD;
goings and-jaunty ways,' 'as a personal injury.&#xD;
When he had learned all he cared to know, he broke' out into&#xD;
some- characteristic petulant observations, upon "nasty selfish-&#xD;
ness," and in the same breath, he sent Chris down cellar after a&#xD;
can of- peaches,. and when' she had opened it and set it out in a&#xD;
glass fruit dish, and brought a gilt saucer-and-sprinkled the luscious&#xD;
fruit plentifully with sugar, he, made faces because. she had used&#xD;
powdered sugar, and would not touch it; and made her go into&#xD;
the kitchen and roll some loaf, saying&#xD;
"I don't stow away marble dust and terra-alba, if I know it."&#xD;
Then he would have some cream.'&#xD;

"But I don't like to get it, Chandy. .I am afraid to disturb&#xD;
the pan, mother will not like it. -She makes butter you. know."&#xD;
"Butter be hanged ! Get me some cream, Chris, I am of&#xD;
more value than many butters," and Chris brought it, though her&#xD;
ears tingled in anticipation. As soon as he had finished his peaches,&#xD;
Chandy thougLt of something he must have from his room, and&#xD;
then he wanted a-box of blocks from the wood-house, and as soon&#xD;
as he got those, he found his happiness depended upon getting&#xD;
instantly a couple of shingles, to make winders for his fish lines,&#xD;
and then he sat and whittled chips all over the floor, for Chris to&#xD;
pick up, all the while turning over the "nasty selfishness " in his&#xD;
mind, and scolding mutteringly.&#xD;
"Blamed shame ! here she has been fretting her life out, against&#xD;
the bars of this old prison, and how tricky to put the onus off on&#xD;
to me. No thank you, mother, not if I have been introduced to&#xD;
myself, and I think I have. Things shall to right about face,&#xD;
double quick. My sister no accomplishments, and all this time&#xD;
lost. _ Why, I shall want her to go into society with me in another&#xD;
year. I'll take her to Paris. I will, by Jove. What will mother&#xD;
say to that ?" and.he laughed enjoyingly at the idea. No dowdy&#xD;
shall go, not. for forty farms," he twisted his foot about and it&#xD;
began to ache.&#xD;
"Come Chris," he called out impatiently, " carry off these&#xD;
things, I'm as tired as a wagon wheel. Do fix these bandages."&#xD;
She had to take them off and apply fresh wormwood, and he&#xD;
was so exacting and so cross that she got nervous, and then vexed&#xD;
and then angry, and finally she blazed up at him, and tossing the&#xD;
flannel back into the basin with a splash which sent the mixture&#xD;
flying; she told him he might do it himself, and then after study-&#xD;
ing her hot cheeks and flashing eyes a moment, he calmed down&#xD;
and was good natured immediately, and let her finish like a lamb.&#xD;
Master Chandy set himself to know about the property, a sub&#xD;
ject which had not interested him particularly up to this time, and&#xD;
when he, lazy fellow as he was, set about anything, he sifted it.&#xD;
iHe ascertained that his mother was sole trustee and executrix.&#xD;
She and they were rich ; good farms, well rented, some excellent&#xD;
&#xD;
802&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
copper stock, which paid handsomely, and an interest in the Mis-&#xD;
sissippi Ferry Company, which alone ought to be a fortune. Be-&#xD;
sides the fancy, there were plenty of solid investments, all sho w-&#xD;
ing never-tiring oversight which he was forced to admire.&#xD;
" Mother is a blamed shrewd woman, is'nt she, Chris ?" said he&#xD;
confidentially. " Pity she's such a stiff old file. When I get well&#xD;
I mean to work her over, she shall have some good clothes, and&#xD;
be- gay and go to all the funerals. She must get rid of the notion&#xD;
that she is too old to enjoy life."&#xD;
Chandy had set for himself a tiresome task. He had resolved&#xD;
that Chris should go to school, and he worked. at it resolutely.&#xD;
The widow was stubborn and grim, and a long time .in giving in.&#xD;
He positively declared that instead of going back to school, he would&#xD;
work in the foundry. " I will, mother," he said.  "I will, I'll&#xD;
be a dirty, sweaty, big-fisted blacksmith if you don't send her,&#xD;
and dress her like a Goldsmith. You shall leave her alone from&#xD;
working all the while, and let her enjoy herself as she likes."&#xD;
This was the end of a long altercation, which had been a strange&#xD;
mixture of scolding, threatening, coaxing, and caresses. Mrs.&#xD;
Goldsmith had made up her mind that she had got to give way,&#xD;
and she looked at her handsome son while he ran on in this strain,&#xD;
with a stiff, grim, motherly pride in her heart, which she, tried&#xD;
hard to conceal from herself. His high-bred face, lighted up with&#xD;
a smile, half earnest, half mocking, but wholly determined to&#xD;
win his purpose - She tried a' compromise by offering to give&#xD;
Chris a summer at the Millville Academy, adding-&#xD;
" But I shan't make a fool of her with finery. I shan't counte-&#xD;
nance no wimpling pins, nor tinkling ornaments. You need'nt&#xD;
talk out Chandos, for I shan't doit. I've set my foot down.":&#xD;
" No mother, nary tinkle," laughed Chandy.&#xD;
"The girl has got to come, up a good steddy economacious&#xD;
woman, that's the course I've been followin, and I mean to stand&#xD;
to it."&#xD;
" The sister I bring out into society shall be an elegant and ac-&#xD;
complished lady. That's the notion I've taken un, aid I mean to&#xD;
stand to it," retorted dutiful Ohandy.&#xD;

" She's got to know thevalue of money, and you need'at talk."&#xD;
"so mother, I won't, she's got to go to school though, and this;&#xD;
Millville Academy business won't begin to go down. You know&#xD;
very well that' you would not send me thei'e.  The teachers&#xD;
are a set of old frimps, and it. is a one horse concern. anyhow.&#xD;
Besides, Chris wants the_ eclat of graduating from some, first&#xD;
class finishing school, and, my sister has got to have it. I. know&#xD;
there must be some place where there'san institute for young men&#xD;
and a school for girls as well. I'll find out, she could be so use&#xD;
ful to me: Don't .you see,. mother, introduce me, to all the- girls,&#xD;
and I could cock. it over the other fellows who don't have pretty&#xD;
sisters in the school."&#xD;
"Do stop talkin about her bein pretty, Chandos. You make&#xD;
me sick; 'handsome is, that handsome does,' I say."&#xD;
"She don't look much like you, mother, that's a, fact, but we&#xD;
will have to put up with that. You'll do the handsome thing now&#xD;
won't-you? If you don't, I will bring down your grey hairs with&#xD;
sorrow to the grave. That is if you leave off dyeing. them.&#xD;
Upon the honor.of a Goldsmith, I will."&#xD;
He seized his crutches, and darted over towhere his mother&#xD;
was sitting; he had been over before several times in the process&#xD;
of the altercation; and throwing himself down beside her, he put&#xD;
arm his around her stiff neck, and. forced her to bend over to h'm.&#xD;
"Come mother, say you will, there's a dear," old girl, he was&#xD;
about- to add, but, checked himself in time, and finished his sen-&#xD;
tence in a dutiful burst. " Dear excellent parient, to your big boy."&#xD;
"Well, well !" she, answered, jerking herself back into an up-&#xD;
right posture, like-a-frisky jack-knife. "ll think about it. You&#xD;
need'nt'jerk my stitches out, that won't help your none."&#xD;
"jBut.mother, I'll, kiss. you any way.. I want. to reflect that&#xD;
Ive performed one virtuous action, when I close my eyes in sweet&#xD;

She looked at him an, instant, and then leaned over, and actu-&#xD;
ally imprinted a. kiss-upon his forehead.&#xD;
Faugh, mother, don't pucker:up your lips into such a knot.&#xD;
I'd as lief kiss a chip;here, I'll show you *how to do' it," and&#xD;

red lips to her's, so that she received his sweet he lithy breath,&#xD;
bilmiy and cool'as it had been iW  his babyhood, and she loved&#xD;
himso'nuch. -It was like a pain inher heart, the yearning fond-&#xD;

'I suppose so, you always was a masterfull little piece; and&#xD;

collar, and pulling herself into shape. Chris coming in at the&#xD;
door, looked on in wide-eyed astonishment. She never dared to&#xD;
ruffle so mudh' as the pasted spit-curl or her mother's proper cheek,&#xD;
.(which it would seem like levity to call a beau-catcher, on such&#xD;

"Your face is full of unrest, Sappho."  The look in his eyes&#xD;
made it dear Sappho, though Chris did not see it. He knew&#xD;
every change of her mobile face. " There is ihore shadow on it&#xD;
than even the flickering fire-shine can account. Quien pregunta&#xD;
yerra, what is it, child ?"&#xD;
"Only a trifle," she answered, hurriedly. " The raking up of&#xD;
a dead hope, which had buried itself; don't speak of it."&#xD;
" Well, permit me, then: I'll speak of something else; some-&#xD;
thing apropos of the Swiss journey you are to take at twenty,"&#xD;
Holding up a great package of books, and tearing down the brown&#xD;
paper wrapping, he showed to her the titles of some of them:&#xD;
"  n~ed rtgtdaii u ht $groFund    to f  igg c  l  " " g g gg.&#xD;
8%uith Wix," &amp;amp;c. There were twelve of them, almost as many&#xD;
as she could lift. She was bewildered ; many events had taken&#xD;
place since the talk at the old wall, yet somehow it had never died&#xD;
out of her thoughts. It would seem that the young doctor never&#xD;
forgot anything which concerned Chris. She gave him no spoken&#xD;
thanks; he seemed not to expect any ; one look from her brown&#xD;
eyes was enough, and she ran hastily up to her room; when she&#xD;
came down there was a bright red spot on either cheek, and her&#xD;
scarlet lips were parted in a radiant smile, and her eyes all aflame.&#xD;
Otho turned toward her with an'expectant glance, which settled&#xD;
into one of grave satisfaction, as he rose and offered her a place&#xD;
near him, intending to begin one of their long. enjoyable talks.&#xD;
But he was hindered by Bertha, who exclaimed.&#xD;
" Look here, Chris dear ; I've been telling Otho that it is quite&#xD;
time he redeemed his promise to us about that ride."&#xD;
Us!" said Otho ; "unless my memory plays mie false, and&#xD;
she is not apt to do that, it was to the victor only that the guerdon&#xD;
belonged; the idlers who were too lazy even to contend, have no&#xD;
part nor lot in the matter."&#xD;
"Ah, but when are -we to have the ride? that is the point now&#xD;
in debate. Don't rake up 'the past. Silence is golden."&#xD;
" What ride ?".inquired Chandy.&#xD;
Bertha told him about the writing-match up at Craienfells ;&#xD;
and  Chandy, before  she had  finished  go   up  a  Cegan fegan;&#xD;
limping about the room, making all sorts of grimaces.&#xD;

"Rather tough walking on it, yet," exclaimed he, dropping into&#xD;
a chair, and wiping his hot face, "but I can ride'; just the exer-&#xD;
cise I need. What a capital suggestion ! Yes, Miss Groenveldt,&#xD;
f you-will deign to accept of a poor cripple as ,escort, I am at&#xD;

"Of course you can't have an idea of. a perfect preux chevelier&#xD;
till you see me, John Chandos, in suit of velvet. 'The- French&#xD;
can well on horseback,' but this gallant, tapping his chest,&#xD;
'Hath witchcraft in't; he grew into his seat,&#xD;
And to such wondrous doings brought his horse&#xD;
As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured&#xD;
With the brave beast."&#xD;
Chandy mouthed his quotation and caressed his moustache.&#xD;
"Something in the Fitz James style," suggested Bertha, ridi-&#xD;
culing his airs.&#xD;
." I suppose I must be very stupid," said Chandy, tossing off his&#xD;
curls petulantly, and gazing at them through half-shut eyes. He&#xD;
was nettled, partly because Chris laughed, and Otho also smiled,&#xD;
though he was, not thinking of Chandy in the least, but of the&#xD;
sweet, roguish look on Chris's face, and how rarely lie had seen&#xD;
it there.&#xD;
Bertha recited merrily:&#xD;
" No foot Fitz James in stirrup stayed,&#xD;
No grasp upon the saddle laid,&#xD;
But wreathed his left hand in the mane,&#xD;
And bounded lightly from the plain."&#xD;
"iThat's all gammon; .sounds well enough, particularly when&#xD;
recited by a sweet voice, (bowing to Bertha.)  Might do in the&#xD;

"I do not like being reminded of my foolish speeches," an--&#xD;

ear, should be as if dropped into a well, covered and forgotten."&#xD;
"True, if Sappho could utter folly'; but shall we have the&#xD;
party which Chandos is- getting up for me? -I am not over-fond&#xD;

I think  Zephyr will acknowledge .you for mistress ; in case he&#xD;

" Thank you," replied Chris, modestly, but with secret exulta-&#xD;
tioar, " thank you, I shall like it very much if my mother-"&#xD;

" Never mind. mother," spoke up Chandos, carelessly, .,"I pro.&#xD;
pose to engineer this festive occasion myself, and I'll{see tha-&#xD;
our revered parent does. not play mar-plot. Let's see, who shall&#xD;
we invite ? There's Sabrina, she'll sit a: horse like a bird- and&#xD;
I'll b9 bound; she's a stylish get-up ;- she's a dainty lady, is the&#xD;
silver-ake goddess&#xD;
'She still retains her maiden gentleness,&#xD;
And oft at eve visits the herds along the t light meadows.'&#xD;
You know you caught. her at it, Otho, that night I. went over the&#xD;
cliff." (All laughed at Chandy's nonsense, except Bertha, whose&#xD;
pretty face lost something of its serenity.) "And Zoe Walsing-&#xD;
ham, Susie Jenkins,. and we'll have the Brandon ; that's. girls&#xD;
enough, we mustn't get up too large a party for Otho's mahogany.&#xD;
I don't see but you and I, Dr. Groenveldt,.will have to be respon-&#xD;
sible for: two unprotected females. I'll., escort Miss Bertha, (by&#xD;
your leave, madamoiselle,) and Sabrina; Peter will take Zoe and&#xD;
Susie, and 'there's my sister and the Brandon, the blue-eyed and&#xD;
beautiful, will naturally fall to your share."&#xD;
"Excuse. me," answered Otho, drily. "I am no esqwire auT&#xD;
dames; Ithink I can manage one woman,, if I put my whole&#xD;
mind to the task ; but I don't feel equal to any further amplfi-&#xD;
cation."&#xD;
"I don't see how we shall fix it," mused Chandy, with his chin&#xD;
in his hand. " However," he soon added, turning the trouble off&#xD;
easily, "there's Peter, he lives here, which I can't be said to do&#xD;
at present, he'll. see to all the details, of course he knows. some&#xD;
eligible fellows., I'll indite a note to him immediately ; runtup,&#xD;

as if she had something to say, and 'did not exactly know how to&#xD;
begin. Finding he did not offer her any help, she said:&#xD;
"May I presume to trouble you, Chandos, with a foolish ques-&#xD;
tion ? .I want your opinion."}&#xD;
"And you consider me capable of pronouncing upon folly.&#xD;
Rather a doubtful compliment, but still you may speak."&#xD;
"Should you suppose, Chandos, that my mother could make&#xD;
any objection to my receiving a gift from some one*?"&#xD;
"Well, that depends entirely upon who the some one may be."&#xD;
"A very good person, Chandos; quite worthy of being respect-&#xD;
ed and liked."&#xD;
"Male or female ?"&#xD;
"Why not a woman, of course ; no woman would think of&#xD;
giving me anything, except, indeed, Ruth Blair ; and it isn't she."&#xD;
"Hum, ha; one of the masculine persuasion ; me for a plum.&#xD;
Your description fits me, and you would delicately hint that I&#xD;
ought to offer you a new hat or a gown, or a gay gold ring; don't&#xD;
press me till I'm my own man once more, and then-"&#xD;
"Now Chandy, don't be'aggravating. It isn't you, of course;&#xD;
I wouldn't mind if you did make me a present, just for the oddity&#xD;
of the thing, though wouldn't I have flown at you once for only&#xD;
proposing it ?"&#xD;
" I'm all in the dark, Chris ; would you object to naming the&#xD;
gift ?"&#xD;
"Books."&#xD;
"ovels ?"&#xD;
"No, German books, rare and costly."&#xD;
"Allons ; I comprehend; the scales drop from my obscured&#xD;
vision. 'I give you my word that I see no reason for debate ;' you&#xD;
may keep safely the books, and enjoy them. : The proprieties not&#xD;
in the least outraged thereby."&#xD;
"'Thank you," said Chris, with a sigh of relief; " and you don't&#xD;
think I ought to speak to mother about it ?"&#xD;
"Certainly not; cui bono."&#xD;
"You are a dear good fellow, Chandos, and I really and truly&#xD;
love you."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yaas, certainly, so they all say ; I suppose I must be very&#xD;
captivating."&#xD;
"Oh, Chandy, if you were the supercilious, 'self-loved person-&#xD;

could not love you."&#xD;

WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.      313&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER TWENTIETH.'&#xD;
THE POSTILLION.&#xD;
CHANDY'S note found steady, rosy-cheeked Peter in the field,&#xD;
marshaling his ien, leading them through deeds of planting, but&#xD;
also in the vein for a frolic, and he took the suggestion 'as a cat&#xD;
laps milk,' and set about the arrangements with as much earnest-&#xD;
ness as he would have given to trying a new reaper, and after a&#xD;
busy morning, he came around to report progress.&#xD;
"I've invited Dulcet Pettibone," he announced with a grin,&#xD;
"and she said she 'opined that it would be pufficly delicious."&#xD;
" What, the ancient learned tabby who, as she assured me,&#xD;
persides in the temple of learning ?"'&#xD;
" The same ; you never saw anybody so tickled as she was with&#xD;
her invitation." -&#xD;
" Who is to have the honor of being her escort? You mustn't&#xD;
count on me ; I haven't digested Worcester yet, and I couldn't&#xD;
stand the pressure."&#xD;
" Why, she's sweet on Captain Slocum, and I thought it would&#xD;
be fair to give her a chance to try on her fascinations in a new&#xD;
sphere.".&#xD;
"All right, Sir Peter ; highly meritorious. ' Sir, he hath not&#xD;
fed of the dainties that are bred in a book, he hath not eat pa-&#xD;
per nor drunk ink ; his intellect is not replenished,' but for all&#xD;
that he has as firm a hand as any man in. Roaring River, and is a&#xD;
fine judge of horses. Peter, my boy, I commend you."&#xD;
"Yes, thank you, Chandy. The Captain was pleased, too,&#xD;
he'll be sure to go. He said, he had been 'hankerin' after a- good&#xD;
time, and he reckoned this occasion would about fill the bill."'&#xD;
(312)&#xD;
&#xD;
"Just so, Peter ; let's consider; one, two, three, seven girls, and&#xD;
only six fellows. We must have another protective, Peter, my&#xD;
boy."&#xD;
"Well," said Peter, considering, " what doyou say to Jan Ved-&#xD;
der ? He's at home now, you know."&#xD;
" But isn't he rather nimble-.-frisky-fast ? You know the=con-&#xD;
undrum, 'Who hath redness of eyes ?'&#xD;
" Them Vedderses is all a bad lot, Universalists or Lutherans,&#xD;
I don't know.which, and it ain't no consequence, they're about the&#xD;
same," said the widow, with disgusted emphasis. " They wouldn't&#xD;
take the Youth's Penny Gazette, didn't want no child's paper, they&#xD;
allowed; as if what the Tract Society prints ain't good enough&#xD;
for old or young. They had to send their boy to the old country&#xD;
to his grandma to keep him out of mischief."&#xD;
"'My grandma lives on yonder little green,&#xD;
Finest old lady thatsever was seen,'&#xD;
hummed Chandy; where does Jan's live ?"&#xD;
. " Over in Holland among the vrows," said Peter, laughing ; he&#xD;
liked his friend's nonsense.&#xD;
" Very right and proper of Jan's parents ; 'home-keepingyoaths&#xD;
have ever homely wits.' -'I intend to be sent the other side rmy-&#xD;
s'lf one of these days. The mischief was a good investment,&#xD;
provided it was only mischief."&#xD;
" He blew up the college pump, and white-washed the Profes-&#xD;
or's- old black mare."&#xD;
Praiseworthy ; he tried his hand at making black white. If&#xD;
that is all, we will have him by all means.. Lead him back to the&#xD;
flowery paths of virtue e, mother; that's right, is it not ?"&#xD;
" Jan is a good-hearted chap," spoke up Peter, stoutly, in spite&#xD;
of the widow's elevated nose. " He'd do anything for a friend;&#xD;
give away his last coat if anybody asked him."&#xD;
"Soft .of him, was it not, 'mother.?"  Claudy winked at his&#xD;
mother. "You and I know better. Those-poor Lutherans being&#xD;
out of the pale, less will be retired of then"'&#xD;

&#xD;
" Jan was a funny little cove, 'before I went to school; he and&#xD;
I used to. make no end of cart-wheels of ourselves."&#xD;
"There's a great deal of talk about him," objected the widow ;&#xD;
"I don't think he's proper to go with decent folks. He drinks,&#xD;
and they 'say he gambles."&#xD;
"Kick him out, boot him down, he's got no friends. Well,&#xD;
mother, I don't pretend to be much of a christian myself, but I&#xD;
don't just look at things in ,that light ; Christ ate with publicans&#xD;
and sinners; if he had gone on the 'stand aside, I am holier than&#xD;
thou' plan, I don't know where we poor sinners would have got&#xD;
in. I think Mary's son gave us a very good example to go by-.&#xD;
it satisfies me for one."&#xD;
His face was ,so serious that his mother screwed her gimlet&#xD;
eyes into him trying to find out whether he were jesting or 'ear-&#xD;
nest.&#xD;
"Tap, tap, tap; flutter, flutter, flatter," and the old oak room is&#xD;
adorned like a flower-garden, and "tinkle, tinkle, tinkle," drops the&#xD;
music of fresh young voices. In fact, though our Chandy was&#xD;
nearly well, the young folks could not bear.to give up their pleas-.&#xD;
ant meetings, and they came strolling in by twos and threes, as&#xD;
the Irishman said, " one in a gang, and two in a gang, and three&#xD;
by themselves," to talk' over the horseback party, which delighted&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Pauline Bradshaw  followed Sabrina, as she did sometimes.&#xD;
listening open-mouthed to all the talk, and turning it over for fu-&#xD;
ture reference. Her sharp eyes took in at a glance -ethe wholc&#xD;
contents of the room, human and otherwise, before she cast down&#xD;
her shaker; and planting herself on a high chair, with her feet&#xD;
drawn up on the top round, she seized theiearest book and began&#xD;
turning it over 1todevour the pictures, while the young ladies dis-&#xD;
cussed their promised pleasure.&#xD;
" Chandy," said Zoe, " I wish you would come home to Roaring&#xD;
River where you belong, and settle down. I consider you a bene-&#xD;
factor of the race, and we sorely need some enterprising young&#xD;
person, who has a mission for getting up frolics."&#xD;

"Thank you for nothing, Miss Walsingham; I intend to be&#xD;
something besides master of the revels, though I do flatter my-&#xD;
self that I am gifted in that capacity. Presumptuous Zoe ! (soul&#xD;
that means,) you shall .yet live to behold Chandos Goldsmith in&#xD;
the front door of the Temple of Fame."&#xD;
" Blanche,.the Hug-not," read Pauline from the book in her&#xD;
hand. "Who's she, Chris ?"  Pauline twitched Chris's dress to se-&#xD;
cure her attention.&#xD;
"One of a very pious sect, who lived in France," answered&#xD;
Chris, absently.&#xD;
"-Did they believe in kissing? no, I know they didn't, because&#xD;
that was their name, Hug-not; did they Chris ? tell me."&#xD;
"I suppose not," replied Chris, still hard at work among her&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
" Belle Brandon is not a Hug-not, that I know."&#xD;
"What is that- you are saying about me, miss ?" exclaimed&#xD;
Belle, facing about, and flashing her eyes' at the fearless child.&#xD;
"Go on, dear," said Zoe, patting her; "explain your meaning."&#xD;
" Why you see she," pointing -to Belle,' "can't be a Hug-not,&#xD;
because I saw Chandy Goldsmith with his arm around her waist,&#xD;
the other day, and she never said, ' Get out, hateful boy,' as I&#xD;
should if Dick should pull me about s'o."&#xD;
" That's right, proper child ! keep Dick at a safe distance."&#xD;
"4Peter is a hug-not, isn't he, Zoe ?" 'asked Pauline, inno-&#xD;
cently.&#xD;
".Of course he is," replied Zoe, tossing her head; "we all are,&#xD;
us Bradshaws and Walsinghams."&#xD;
"Ah, mon dieu!" murmured Belle, darting baleful glances at&#xD;
the two. " What an enfant terrible!"&#xD;
Chandos looked extremely foolish under the, laughter which&#xD;
greeted Pauline's pursuit of knowledge ; but he carried it -off with&#xD;
a nonchalant air, and pulling out a penny from his pocket he hand-&#xD;
it over, saying:&#xD;
herer, child, always keep as sharp a look-out on your acquaint-&#xD;
ances; and you will be reckoned a' jewel in society."&#xD;

Mrs. Goldsmith snuffed and drew in her lips in a kind of sour&#xD;
amusement.&#xD;
"Do you like butternuts ?" asked she.&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
"Well, go up into the wood-house chamber and you'll find&#xD;
plenty of them.&#xD;
"Now that's nice," said Pauline, rising with alacrity; "I like&#xD;
you.&#xD;
Do you?" said the widow with a grim smile at the unexpect-&#xD;
ed compliment, for Pauline usually steered very clear of her.&#xD;
" Yes, I like you pretty much, but I like Christabel ever so&#xD;
much better."&#xD;
"How so?" inquired Zoe, anticipating fun.&#xD;
Sabrina sat on pins, and vainly tried to extinguish the irre-&#xD;
pressible, who dodged all her reproving glances. She would say&#xD;
her say, and pointed with her finger to make her meaning more&#xD;
obvious.&#xD;
"You see her fare 'is fine and smooth, and yours is all crumpled&#xD;
up; that's why.. Now bring on your butternuts."&#xD;
"What's the hods, mother, so long as you are 'appy," exclaimed&#xD;
Chandy, clapping his hands in huge enjoyment of her position:&#xD;
"sorry I haven't another penny for you, Pauline, but I'll give you&#xD;
my blessing."&#xD;
" Perhaps you would hunt me a penny if I promised to tell you&#xD;
what Belle Brandon said about you."&#xD;
Something nice, .of course," exclaimed Chandy, with affected&#xD;
rapture. " I must try to bring out a picayune, I feel sure it will be&#xD;
richly worth it.- Now then, here it is, fresh from the mint," hold-&#xD;
ing the bright coin in his extended palm.&#xD;
"Well, then, she said you was a p-h-u-1-e, and I want you to&#xD;
tell me what :that is, for I don't know."&#xD;
" raiment cette charmant Pauline has a remarkable mmory,"&#xD;
said Belle, laughing merrily, right into Chandy's eyes, not even&#xD;
changin color ; "she .remembers things which never occurred,"&#xD;
"Christabel1"-'said Sabrina, rising hastily and trying to turn&#xD;
&#xD;
the conversation from her very numerous little, sister, "let us see&#xD;
your habit."&#xD;
"I have none," answered Chris, who sat apart, darning stock-&#xD;
ings, and whose eyes were red and heavy.&#xD;
"Why, how doyou expect to look without; a, habit," said Zoe.&#xD;
" They say our grandmothers rode tochurch and paid their .visits-&#xD;
in their linsey-woolsey short gowns, and even some. on pillions,&#xD;
behind their favored swains ; but that was.in the. infancy of civil-&#xD;
izatiQn, when. John Alden's bride went to. be married on the milk-.&#xD;
white ox. We their descendants know better."&#xD;
"I shall not be of your party," said Chris, quietly drawing out&#xD;
her needle.&#xD;
A chorus of voices exclaimed and inquired directly-&#xD;
"You are going-don't be absurd," said Chandos, promptly.&#xD;
" What possessed you to come out with that statement ? "-&#xD;
"A habit does not possess me, Chandy," answered Chris, try-&#xD;
ing to speak lightly ; "and Zoe has demonstrated-the impossibility&#xD;
of going without one ; therefore I must strive to possess. my soul&#xD;
in patience at home."&#xD;
S" Screw loose, mother," blurted out Chandy. "Jove! 'I shall&#xD;
be driven to assume the command of this ship at-,an earlier pe-&#xD;
riod than the law allows. There's something out of gear all the&#xD;
while. Come, mother, expound."&#xD;
He turned impatiently on the widow, who had retired into her&#xD;
knitting since Pauline's attack, grim and stiff in her straight-&#xD;
backed chair, and who frowned on the saucy fellow in most un,&#xD;
promising rigidity.&#xD;
"I know what it is, you want meto pick out one. I can do;&#xD;
it-time is short, but--"&#xD;
" Ch-istabel has got a riding-dress plenty good enough, all&#xD;
she'll have tenerate. She can wear it or she can let it alone,"&#xD;
The widow felt angry at the proposed frolic, as. she always did.&#xD;
at any merry-making, and though she could not hinder it, she waS&#xD;
not at all sorry at Chris' disappointment.&#xD;
" I shall let it alone," said Chris firmly. "I cannot afford to&#xD;
he always a.spectacle."&#xD;

"We are to be quite a party of make-shifts, I believe," insinu/.&#xD;
ated Belle Brandon, in a sweet, childish way, her dimples all dis-&#xD;
,played, and her eyes glittering. "-I for one-must improvise some-&#xD;
thing. My Mary Ann is going to cut down a habit her mother.&#xD;
used to curvet in; unfortunately for poor little me, I've got none&#xD;
-" "and the little pig will have to stay at home," put in Pauline,&#xD;
in the same breath, so that it all sounded like Belle's voice.&#xD;
"If Christabel had a speck of come up. to her, she might do,&#xD;
so too," grumbled the widow. " There's my habit, just as good&#xD;
as new. I had it when I got married, and I-never put it ona my,&#xD;
back half a dozen times.". And she glowered wrathfully over&#xD;
the memory, how soon her young husband had forgotten to invite&#xD;
her to accompany him in his long rides about the pleasant coun-&#xD;
try. "Its the finest kind of broadcloth; there it hangs. She&#xD;
can take it or leave it, just as she likes. I'm sure .I don't care a&#xD;
pin about her going ; but she can't say she hain't had a chance."&#xD;
" Why mother, that's nonsense," said Chandos. "An old-time&#xD;
concern like that on my sister, and the party of my engineering."&#xD;
The widow only drew out her lips more prim, and shook her&#xD;
head about as if she'd got a palsy, and stabbed Chris with her&#xD;
glances, and her stocking with her sharp needles.&#xD;
" Let's see the habit," said Zoe. " I'd, like to look at a riding-&#xD;
dress made that long ago."&#xD;
" Yes, do, Christabel pet," chimed in Belle, "who knows but&#xD;
we may strike out some original idea if you don it, which will be&#xD;
available to us poor habitless mortals."&#xD;
Chris fidgeted, and was about ungraciously to refuse. This&#xD;
public discussion of her affairs was gall and wormwood to her ;&#xD;
but Chandy saw no reason for any concealments, and called ot-&#xD;
" Come, -mother ! you hear the request; toddle up and fetch&#xD;
the garment, 'dispatch ! and say I sent you.' I'm going to have&#xD;
this thing satisfactorily arranged. These-young spinsters are so&#xD;
kind as to constitute themselves into a court of inquiry."&#xD;
" Why Chandos Goldsmith! what impertinence ! Are you not&#xD;
ashamed to speak like that to your mother ?"&#xD;
"I don't think I blush, do I? (lifting his curls and presenting&#xD;
&#xD;
his cheek for inspection.) Ask mother if she thinks I ought to&#xD;
beg pardon. I'll do so immediately; she knows I'm her dutiful&#xD;
boy -to command," he added, mischievously smiling in the widow's&#xD;
face. The widow did not in the least thank Zoe for her interfer-&#xD;
ence,, and took care to let her understand it. In fact she rather&#xD;
liked Chandy's racy impudence, which was always mingled with&#xD;
whimsical fondness. Therefore she performed her idea of'a com-&#xD;
placent smile upon her handsome son, as she rose and stalked out&#xD;
of the room to do his bidding.&#xD;
The door to the studio was locked. It had been seldom opened&#xD;
in the five years which followed poor Fred's death, and his relict&#xD;
was therefore somewhat startled by a rustle and a commotion jn&#xD;
the tenantless garret, close by the closed door ; and she stopped&#xD;
a moment to listen. Behold Rainbow arose from a fragrant bed&#xD;
of dried catmint, and stretched himself as from pleasant repose.&#xD;
" The land sakes ! how did you get up here? that curless.- girl&#xD;
must have let you foller her when she got the hops. You've been&#xD;
at my catnip,. have you,.you nasty rep-tile. I wish it was hen-&#xD;
bane; but, pisin won't kill you. I wonder if starvin will; I'll&#xD;
try it anyhow. You may stay up here since you like the place.&#xD;
I expect there's mice you can live on till you catch 'em, and after&#xD;
that you can suck your paws like the bears.". She fetched the&#xD;
dress and whisked nimbly down the stairs, banging the door after&#xD;
her, and hiding the key in her pocket.- Stopping on the landing,&#xD;
she called out-&#xD;
"Come up and git this, Christabel. I've waited on you all I'm&#xD;
going to." Perhaps she hated to meet her daughter's clear eyes&#xD;
after preparing so aggravating a grief for her. Starving is a piti-&#xD;
ful death to die, even for a cat.&#xD;
Belle Brandon rose instantly. "Let us .go together and try it&#xD;
on, and then well come down and show ourselves."&#xD;
".That's right, do," chorused the girls, "and we'll, have a Di&#xD;
Vernon tableau, if we can't make it available otherwise."&#xD;
"' The affair cries 'haste,'-*and speed must answer it,"-said Chan-&#xD;
dos, waiving them off.&#xD;
Chris obeyed, slowly and unwillingly, following Belle's tripping&#xD;

steps up the stairs. There, lay the. habit in a forlorn wrinkled&#xD;
heap, and smelling dismally of camphor. It was of the ancient&#xD;
cudt called a "Josey," and since revived under the name of " Pos-&#xD;
tillion." - After some coaxing Chris permitted herself to be per-&#xD;
suaded to put it on, with the hat, which was, a low-crowned&#xD;
beaver, loaded with feathers,, and heavy enough' for a dragoon.&#xD;
Belle laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks at the odd figure.&#xD;
" Such a Guy !" said she ; " those funny little jockey tails !"&#xD;
and she secretly resolved to move heaven and earth to induce her&#xD;
to appear in .it. Chris, meanwhile, had almost forgotten what&#xD;
they were about, so intently was she gazing at Belle. She was&#xD;
thinking how like she was to the Geraldine in her father's studio,&#xD;
with her red lips parted over her little sharp white teeth, her&#xD;
dimpled, cheeks, soft floating hair, and the wicked bewildering&#xD;
light in her dangerous eyes. She shuddered and felt chilly as&#xD;
she looked, and, while Belle ran on in her ringing tones, she&#xD;
stood as if under a spell.&#xD;
"You have an odd way of staring at one, I must say," ex-&#xD;
claimed Belle at length, finding that Chris was not listening to,&#xD;
her talk.&#xD;
" Have I?" said Chris, rousing herself, and passing her hand&#xD;
over her face. "I'm afraid I was inattentive. What is it ?"&#xD;
" Why, I have been wasting my breath telling you how to fix&#xD;
your habit. A little trouble will bring it out elegant. I wish I&#xD;
was half as well provided. I don't know what I am to do, I'm&#xD;
sure."&#xD;
Now Miss Brandon had, as usual, a little axe to grind in wish-&#xD;
ing to be alone with Chris. She was at her wits-end for an out-&#xD;
fit. Her allowance exhausted ; Mrs. Williams- deaf to all her.&#xD;
talk. Having had.as yet no chance to show off her horseman-&#xD;
ship to the Roaring Riverites, she was of course eagerly anxious&#xD;
to go to the frolic. She had had lessons at Desbrough's, and&#xD;
knew that-her blonde beauty was 'never so beautiful as when set&#xD;
off by the} costume., She, looking on, and studying the faces&#xD;
after her fashion, had seen from Chandy's looks that Chris would&#xD;
be fitted to a-habit, and'while she could have slapped her for dar-&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH' DAUGHTER.        X21&#xD;
&#xD;
ing to possess such a handsome -brother, she thought peradven-&#xD;
ture she .might turn the despised broadcloth to account for herself&#xD;
should it prove of a choice fabric. She. was expert with her&#xD;
needle, 'and not troubled by any delicate scruples. So her ends&#xD;
were answered, and her appointments complete, she cared little&#xD;
upon whom she levied for supplies.: ~But as soon as she set eyes&#xD;
upon Chris thus arrayed, she changed her mind, and resolved that,&#xD;
she should be made, by hook or by crook, to appear in it. She&#xD;
so thoroughly \enjoyed seeing a friend ridiculous. It was nuts to&#xD;
crack, and she knew how so delicately to contribute to the fun;&#xD;
therefore she now put on her prettiest smile, and set herself to&#xD;
convince Chris that the old habit was just the thing.&#xD;
"I declare, Chris," she exclaimed rapturously, and allowing&#xD;
herself for once to use ,a slang phrase, which, to do her justice,&#xD;
she usually eschewed, "it will be gay. I'll come over and pin&#xD;
up the.shoulder-seams this evening, if you will permit me, dear.&#xD;
I'm sure you will like it as I pin it, because if I have a genius&#xD;
for any line of business, it is fitting dresses."&#xD;
" But I am afraid I shall be absurd," said Chris -doubtfully,&#xD;
turning about and about before her mirror. " Those curious little&#xD;
tails ! I wish they were curtailed. It looks like, that picture of&#xD;
Hogarth's, where they are hoisting the fat woman into the stage-&#xD;
coach.. The lean one who is waiting her turn has on exactly such&#xD;
a thing as this. . If only I had time to take it to pieces and make&#xD;
.it up afresh. But I couldn't do it if I had a millenium, for, as&#xD;
mother says, I've got no gumption."&#xD;
" Oh, they won't be noticed indeed, on horseback. It's the&#xD;
general effect which tells ; and seriously, Chris, it.suits your style,&#xD;
gives you an air Je ne sais quoi, like a lady of old romance, all&#xD;
chivalry, troubadours, gauntlets, black silk masks, and hawks and&#xD;
hounds."&#xD;
" Really I must be an eminently suggestive personage if I re-&#xD;
mind you of all that," said Chris quietly.&#xD;
Belle would have stopped soon, any way, for she was quiteout&#xD;
of breath with her enthusiasm, and all the while she was laugh-&#xD;
ing inside, almost beside herself with delight at the astonishment&#xD;

and mirth which she foresaw would greet the advent of the&#xD;
Joseph, as well as appetizing deliciously before-hand the dismay&#xD;
of exquisite Chandy, with whom she was doing her best to strike&#xD;
up an ardent flirtation, without marked success. She abandoned&#xD;
her first idea of producing Chris down stairs, reflecting that such&#xD;
a premature exhibition would spoil all her anticipated fan, and&#xD;
she demurely helped her off with the cumbrous head-gear, and&#xD;
left her to-disrobe, while she flew down and exclaimed in gay&#xD;
gladness, waving her dimpled hands, and clasping them, and set-&#xD;
ting her head on one.side--.&#xD;
" Dear Chris will be rarelyhabited. The fabric is. exquisite,&#xD;
and after a little assistance which I am to render her this evening,&#xD;
the fit will be perfect.. She sends compliments and declines to&#xD;
show herself, which refusal she bids me endorse for wisdom. She&#xD;
is a lucky girl, certainly, and has only to open her mouth and all&#xD;
the good things make haste to drop into it. I must run off and&#xD;
try what I can. accomplish in the robing line. I wish I was Mrs.&#xD;
Peter Wilkins,-and had a neat little flying dress, how I would&#xD;
blandly ignore all dressmakers.- Good-evening, gentlefolks."&#xD;
Chandy concluded that it was all right, as Chris said nothing in&#xD;
contradiction of Belle's statement. When he questioned her 'she&#xD;
answered shortly that "she thought it would do," and he dismissed&#xD;
the subject from his thoughts, and thoroughly enjoyed .a good&#xD;
long game of chess with his well-armed opponent, Sabrina, while&#xD;
the rest went their several ways.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE.&#xD;
CHRIS WEIGHED IN THE BALANCE.&#xD;
AT night-fall Otho came in, and in a very restless mood for&#xD;
him. He fidgeted with Chris' spools, and punched the fire, and&#xD;
sent the sparks out like flying meteorolites, until Chandy, out of&#xD;
patience, exclaimed-&#xD;
" Do put that poker down, Otho ! You make' my blood run&#xD;
cold."&#xD;
Chandy's speech caused him instantly to resume his usual grave,&#xD;
quiet, dominating self at once. Drawing Chris into the deep&#xD;
- window, he said to her--&#xD;
"My mother has arrived, Sappho; I have promised to take&#xD;
you to see her."&#xD;
" Yqur mother, sir !" exclaimed Chris, paling and looking&#xD;
frightened. "When am I to go ?"&#xD;
" Now, this evening, if you will so far pleasure me."  -&#xD;
"I think mother is intending to go to meeting, and Chandy&#xD;
will need me."&#xD;
"What .is it that I need ?" questioned that individual, who&#xD;
overheard his name.&#xD;
"I wish Christabel to go out with me for an hour, and she de-&#xD;
clines on your account."&#xD;
"I shall stay with my son," said the widow. "-A little devo-&#xD;
tional reading will do him good after all the frippery talk there&#xD;
has been in this house this afternoon. I am in the thirty-first&#xD;
chapter of the Great Tribulation, which will have a salutary&#xD;
effect."&#xD;

&#xD;
"None of that, mother," said Chandy, making 'a horribly wry&#xD;
face.&#xD;
Mrs: Goldsmith had entirely ceased to refuse Chris her liberty.&#xD;
She had to do it, "my son" made such a fuss.&#xD;
"I'm not a chicken that I should be hovered, I believe. Just&#xD;
draw up the table and give me David Copperfield, and you may&#xD;
all go to grass, and eat mullein."&#xD;
"Dear'Chandy," said Chris softly, half afraid at her own dar-&#xD;
ing; "please don't say such things ; they are unworthy of you."&#xD;
"1Hump ! fiddlesticks ! what highfalutin folderols," growled the&#xD;
widow.&#xD;
"Our Chris'is blossoming out," remarked Chandy, laughing to&#xD;
Otho. ."Every day she unfolds afresh--philosopher, scholar, poet.&#xD;
She has one more role to try, woman of fashion, as soon as I get&#xD;
well enough to attend to it; and to-day behold her as Minerva-&#xD;
Mentor, and she reproves me, 'me, an old Castilian !' I can tell&#xD;
you, Mentor, Belle Brandon is not at all of your opinion."  His&#xD;
eyes were full of merry mischief, and I think Belle would have&#xD;
feared him had she been present. " She only yesterday assured&#xD;
me that a little slang, so it was quaint and delicate, gave piquancy&#xD;
totconversation ; and still further, I made her confess that a soup-&#xD;
gon of genteel swearing might- enrich and embellish one's Eng-&#xD;
lish."     -&#xD;
"I am not in the least surprised," said Chris scornfully. "Her&#xD;
role just then was to fall in with what she supposed your opin-&#xD;
ions. Though I must say I think the conversation does you as&#xD;
little credit as it does her. I believe she was fooling with you.&#xD;
She's too sharp to be taken in."&#xD;
"I imagine Miss Belle likes a good many strings to her bow,&#xD;
and she counts on Chandy to twang well," said Otho, smiling.&#xD;
"A good. many beaux to her string, you mean ; well, I don't&#xD;
object to dangle somewhat; she's a rare beauty, and she'll stand&#xD;
a deal of looking at."&#xD;
"Drop her, please," exclaimed Chris, disgusted.-&#xD;
"With pleasure. 'These are .gracious drops.' I'll Pettibone&#xD;
my grass and mullein for your polite ears. 'Proceed at your&#xD;
&#xD;
earliest convenience to the arrhentherun, and prepare a matutinal&#xD;
repast from the Ariscma triphyllum.' How does that suit you'?"&#xD;
" Much the same as the other ; that is slang condensed, this&#xD;
only slang elongated; besides, though you have secured some fine&#xD;
long words, they unfortunately are the wrong ones. Arrhentkemzrn&#xD;
means a kind of oats, and the other is only wild turnip."&#xD;
" Oh.well, Chris, you shouldn't trip up a fellow's learning," said&#xD;
Chandy,. squirming out of his mistakes.&#xD;
"Don't view me with a cricket's eye,&#xD;
But pass me a drink, for I'm awful dry."&#xD;
pointing to the ice-pitcher, which he forced his mother to keep&#xD;
supplied, in spite of her repeated declaration that the well water&#xD;
was plenty cold enough.&#xD;
Chris obeyed, smilingly, and Otho said:&#xD;
"Miss Goldsmith is right, Chandos ; you must confess yourself&#xD;
in a miserable minority."&#xD;
"Let's change the subject, Otho. You may.tell me some more&#xD;
about the art-school, while Chris rags out-excuse me, Mentor-&#xD;
dons her habiliments."&#xD;
Chris treated him to a hopeless glance, which made him laugh,&#xD;
and went away for her hat and mantle.&#xD;
Otho rose to open the door for her, as was his chivalrous habit,&#xD;
and glanced uneasily at her soiled and crumpled collar, and fruzzy&#xD;
hair, all tumbled by the beaver, and ignored ever since. He was&#xD;
ready tomake a request, but checked himself, and drew back a&#xD;
little haughtily, determined not, to interfere. Still, when she re-&#xD;
appeared, he could not keep himself from scanning her with a&#xD;
quick glance. But whatever his thought was, he said no word,&#xD;
and offered his arm with his usual deferential politeness; and as.&#xD;
they walked on he led' .the talk on their favorite themes, and lis-&#xD;
tened to her remarks with his accustomed enjoyment.&#xD;
The Groenveldts were at the Millville House, and were to go&#xD;
up to Craigenfills on the morrow. Chris dropped her eyes and&#xD;
colored painfully when Otho presented her to-his mother, and she&#xD;
did not' dare to look up when' her offered hand was firmly grasped&#xD;

&#xD;
and she was greeted in a clear, decided voice. But when the&#xD;
Professor spoke her name in genial tone and with a German end-&#xD;
ing, and added to his accost a " God. bless you, Fraulein," she&#xD;
raised her eyes eagerly to his face, and got what the voice prom-&#xD;
ised her--an indulgent, fatherly smile, which reflected back from&#xD;
her eyes instantly, and parted her lips in their prettiest curve.&#xD;
Herr Groenvekot was habited in his dressing-gown, out of which&#xD;
he hardly knew how to exist. He seated the blushing girl by his&#xD;
side and, began to talk. He was as guileless as a child, and full&#xD;
of gentle scholarship; and his son had but to start him on a fa-&#xD;
vorite theme, and he launched out into all sorts of amusing am-&#xD;
plifications, just such as Chris liked; and the troubled look could&#xD;
not possess her face again, though some flitting shadows clouded&#xD;
it whenever madame demanded her attention. Otho kept the&#xD;
conversation mostly in his father's hands, however, by an occa-&#xD;
sional question or comment, and was. secretly delighted at the&#xD;
pretty thoughts Chris produced, and glanced furtively at his&#xD;
mother, studying her aspect. She was a stout, business-looking&#xD;
lady, possessed of excellent judgment, and the firmest of wills;&#xD;
every way fitted to fill her position; but if her son expected any&#xD;
encouraging glances from her clear eyes on a, decision he was&#xD;
about making, or any help from her shrewd, practical sense, he&#xD;
was utterly disappointed. She was sitting with her shapely hands&#xD;
folded over her black silk dress, her wrists were shaded with falls&#xD;
of handsome lace,, her collar was broad and rich, and fastened with&#xD;
a rare cairn-ghorm which Otho brought her from Edinburgh; her&#xD;
watch-chain was heavy and of choice workmanship, and every-&#xD;
thing about her 'costly and befitting. Her manner betokened ha-&#xD;
bitual control of herself and others, her faculties were all awake,'&#xD;
calmly and coolly attentive.4~-&#xD;
The visit was at an end. Madame had kissed Christabel's&#xD;
cheek, and the Professor put her hand to his lips, German fash-&#xD;
ion, and the young man and the maiden were on their way back&#xD;
to Brookside. She felt glad that the ordeal was passed, and&#xD;
breathed more freely, when Otho said in a tone even kinder than&#xD;
usual:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Sappho, will you do me a favor ?"&#xD;
"Certainly, if 'I can," she returned in a glad' voice ; "nothing&#xD;
would make me happier."&#xD;
"It is only a smell matter, just to wear your hair next Satur-&#xD;
day as you wore it that pleasant' day up at Craigenfells, which I&#xD;
feel sure you-have not forgotten."&#xD;
" Forgotten ! As if I could ever forget such a day; the first&#xD;
really happy one I had known for so long."&#xD;
"Thank you, Sappho. I take that as a personal compliment&#xD;
to me, your host, and you will arrange your hair in that charming&#xD;
knot to please me ?"&#xD;
" I do not know yet, sir, if I am to be of your party ; but if I&#xD;
am, I will certainly try my best, since you attach importance to&#xD;
my style of coiffure, which seems to me a trifle, light as air."&#xD;
Otho's face clouded, but he said :&#xD;
" The party will be spoiled for me, Sappho, if you are not there.&#xD;
I was out with Zephyr this morning, and I just whispered in his&#xD;
ear the honor in store for him; 'twere a -pity to disappoint him.&#xD;
I think I shall find a way to withdraw altogether, unless you&#xD;
make my promise good. He never forgets a slight."&#xD;
Chris, glanced archly at him. " You remind me of the :Puri-&#xD;
tan maiden Priscilla," said she. "I must speak for Chandy;&#xD;
your absence would sorely vex him."&#xD;
"I think Zephyr will be out that day, and Tramp also,".said&#xD;
he, smiling; " for my father is at Craigenfells, and he will tell&#xD;
you more tales.&#xD;
"I like your father, Otho; he is truly charming."&#xD;
"And my mother ?" he asked quietly.&#xD;
"I am afraid of her ; she looks into my soul."&#xD;
"I hope she does; you would not suffer by such scrutiny. You&#xD;
will learn to love her," he added, confidently. " She is.worthy of&#xD;
all respect and 'affection. Here' we are, already., Won't you&#xD;
give me a flower, Sappho, to lay onsmy pillow ? they say fresh&#xD;
blossoms, culled by moonlight,' having touched only pure fingers,&#xD;
bring dreams that come true."&#xD;

She stooped and plucked half a dozen pansies, and offered&#xD;
them with a quiet smile. "I almost know what you will -dream&#xD;
about," said she; "those Swiss pictures which are ever floating&#xD;
about you."&#xD;
"1 think I know also, and I shall pray that it may not be all a&#xD;
dream; but you must breathe on them first ; put them to your&#xD;
lips, that rounds the charm."&#xD;
She obeyed him shyly, and he arranged the pretty, velvety&#xD;
things in his button-hole, and bade her good-night at her mother's&#xD;
door.&#xD;
As she mounted the stairs, she called softly, "Rainbow, Rain-&#xD;
bow ;" she wanted to whisper to him a little before she went to&#xD;
sleep. She had, some dear thoughts, as well as some faint fears,&#xD;
and a few doubts to think over, and it always comforted her to&#xD;
hold him in her arms.&#xD;
"You needn't call that there cat," said the widow from under&#xD;
her night-cap; "because he won't come.&#xD;
The sudden scream sounded in Chris's ears like the crack of&#xD;
doom.&#xD;
"Is anything-has he-has Bax Williams ?"&#xD;
"I tended up to him myself. Pizen wouldn't do it, but I ruther&#xD;
expect starvin"' will."&#xD;
"Starving!" faltered Chris. " Oh, where is poor Rainbow ?"&#xD;
" Up garret, Miss, where you let him in, though you've time&#xD;
and again been told not to; and I've locked-the door on him. The&#xD;
key is in my pocket, where I caccalate to hold on to't. You shall&#xD;
fetch out the dear cretur before he gets to be carrin."&#xD;
" Oh !" said Chris in a voice of' relief, which unpleasantly puz-&#xD;
zled the -widow, and passing on her way, she softly shut her door;&#xD;
then putting her head out at the =open window, she called again:&#xD;
" Rainbow ! Rainbow !" and= soon she heard above her a quick&#xD;
jump into the 'tulip tree, and asharp rustle among the' broad&#xD;
leaves, which certainly was not the wind. It was a' leap for a&#xD;
catamount'or for Rainbow, and in a minute he came purring about&#xD;
his mistress and licking her hand. Whether he tarried to catch&#xD;
the mice the widow told him about, or he had not finished his nap&#xD;
&#xD;
I can't say, but here he was, bright and happy. I feel sure he&#xD;
must have laughed to think how he had done his kind old admirer.&#xD;
Chris laughed heartily.&#xD;
" So the garret window was open, Rainbow, and you have left&#xD;
the prison as you entered it, unknown to your jailor, who has the&#xD;
key in her pocket ! She has not seen you take the leap as often&#xD;
as I have."&#xD;
"Permow," said Rainbow, and Chris leaned over the sill, and&#xD;
caroled softly:.&#xD;
" Those ponderous keys shall the kelpies keep,&#xD;
And lodge in their caverns so dark and deep."&#xD;

CHAPTER TWENTY-SE COND.&#xD;
A WILLFUL MAN MA.UN HAVE HIS WAY.&#xD;
OTHo returned slowly to the hotel and found his mother wait-&#xD;
ing for him. She was sitting by herself, and seemed to have&#xD;
been intently thinking, for she had let the wax candles on the&#xD;
table gutter fearfully, and she was a careful, thrifty house-wife, who&#xD;
could abide no waste, even of hotel candles. The good Professor&#xD;
had retired, and was already lapped in gentle slumber.&#xD;
" Well, mother," said Otho, standing before her, and looking in&#xD;
her face.&#xD;
" Well, my son," returned she, avoiding his glance.&#xD;
" You look aside while I speak to you, and you also make me&#xD;
wait, two things which I especially dislike," said he, firmly.&#xD;
"If you insist upon my utterance on that subject, I shall say&#xD;
what will give you pain to hear. I may as well be plain, how-&#xD;
ever. It will never do, Otho; so shy, so unfinished, and don't be&#xD;
offended if I add so very dowdy. You would be ashamed of such&#xD;
a choice a hundred times in every day ; you would'bitterly regret&#xD;
such folly. I know you, my son, better than you know yourself,&#xD;
and I tell you decidedly you must drop her out-of your thoughts;&#xD;
your life else will be spoiled, made wretched by disorder, and&#xD;
petty, annoying discomforts."&#xD;
"She is so young," pleaded Otho; so good, so- true, so cultiva-&#xD;
ted, so richly gifted. You surely will not condemn the poor child&#xD;
for one fault? A year with you will set that right. Chandos has&#xD;
been talking to me about the art school, which jumps with my&#xD;
plans ; for I desire to have her with. Bertha and under your care.&#xD;
(330)&#xD;
&#xD;
You must do this for your only son; I am positive that my little&#xD;
darling has been systematically left out in the cold."&#xD;
"Little !" commented madame ; " why the girl is as tall as a&#xD;
steeple!"&#xD;
Otho, who did not heed the interruption, went on, walking up&#xD;
and down:&#xD;
"Once brought into a genial atmosphere of tenderness and&#xD;
cheerful home-life, she will blossom like a rose. I asked her to play,&#xD;
and the music ran rippling from her supple fingers. She sings in&#xD;
notes as true as a wood-lark's ; she sketches, and her figures live.&#xD;
I set her to write some rhymes, and she brought me a little pas-&#xD;
toral in such tender, pleasant measure as has floated about me&#xD;
ever since; she talks to me in a voice of thrilling music; she is&#xD;
never at fault; she brings out stores of knowledge which amaze&#xD;
and delight me, so rich and rare are they, and she does not know&#xD;
one of her thousand attractions. So purely, simply modest is she,&#xD;
that, she fears my frown, and looks for my approving smiles; yet&#xD;
so richly endowed that with any one of her many gifts she might&#xD;
make herself a shining name."&#xD;
Madame looked politely incredulous, and her lip curled. " You&#xD;
are in love, Otho; but allowing it all to be true, and the shining&#xD;
name achieved, would you, Otho Groenveldt, the proud man, con-&#xD;
sent to be an appendage to your wife, the husband of the distin-&#xD;
guished Mrs. Groenveldt?  Enviable position, truly !"&#xD;
Otho paused, with a gesture of angry impatience, and was&#xD;
about to speak, but checked himself, and restrained his thought&#xD;
with courteous deference to his mother.&#xD;
"Bertha thinks-"&#xD;
"I know what Bertha thinkss" said Otho, interrupting her&#xD;
hastily, but still respectfully; " it is my life which is to be made or&#xD;
marred, and not hers, and I wil not permit her to offer an opinion.&#xD;
Mother," said he, stopping in his long stride in front of her chair.&#xD;
" It is too late to talk ; my happinessis there."&#xD;
" Have you then already corpmitted yourself?" exclaimed she,&#xD;
with an alarmed.look."&#xD;

"I think Chris must know that I'love her,. though I have never&#xD;
spoken it in words."&#xD;
"That is well, my son; you are wiser than my fears."&#xD;
Dear mother, I feel sure you will be of my opinion when you&#xD;
have found;of your own knowledge how truly good as well as&#xD;
richly gifted is Christabel. I don't want a dressed doll for my&#xD;
wife; I must have:a soul and a heart."&#xD;
"Yes," answered madame, "and you must have them enshrined.&#xD;
in.a perfectly cared for, wholesome body; believe me, a lady-like&#xD;
-exterioris indispensable. When you say 'my wife,' you will not&#xD;
like presenting to your friends, a head en coiffure, as'if the mock-&#xD;
ing sport of -a whirlwind, nails dressed in mourning, and button-&#xD;
less garments, frayed, and soiled, and tumbled. Indeed, I am&#xD;
surprised that Miss Goldsmith did not think it worth her while to&#xD;
array herself neatly, even elaborately, when invited to pay a visit&#xD;
to your mother. Her appearance this evening was but a.,sorry,&#xD;
compliment to you, dear Otho, besides. being very nearly a&#xD;
disrespect to me."&#xD;
" Mother, you are unmercifully hard upon poor Chris," said&#xD;
Otho, in an offended tone.&#xD;
"My honest wishes for your best happiness force me to be so."&#xD;
".But:you :have seen her but once ;-you will change your opinion."&#xD;
- "Yes I may, when Miss Goldsmith mends her manners, not&#xD;
else, I assure you. If you had lived an age .ago I should accuse'&#xD;
her of witchcraft;: as.it is, I cannot account for your curious fancy..&#xD;
Dowdy women are not usually greatly in favor with your sex,&#xD;

You would cease to wonder at what you call my infatuation,&#xD;
if, you had hved for days together in her delightful society, as I&#xD;
have."&#xD;
"If only .she wore fresher collars."  Madanie shrugged her&#xD;
shoulders.&#xD;
Otho sat down, and leaned his head on his palm, and'thought'&#xD;
"Can you. believe, my mother," said he, at length, "that there&#xD;
lives a woman who would refuse to array herself, if the apparel&#xD;
were offered her."&#xD;

"Perhaps 'not; but to what good if neatness and order are&#xD;
wanting.?  Bertha is very Pearly perfect in this respect," she said,&#xD;
with pardonable mother-pride, "and is therefore always an agree-&#xD;
able object in the household."&#xD;
" Bertha is all very well," replied Otho, smiling, " and is a dear&#xD;
sweet sister; but Bertha is not a 'genius."&#xD;
"No, thank heaven, she is not."&#xD;
" Oh mother, don't set me down so sharp. -'I'wish I could coax&#xD;

me-nots, among whose graceful stems he wove the letters, aslike&#xD;
as possible to those he had seen on the handkerchief she carried&#xD;
up at Craigenfells; and the exactness of the -copy showed how&#xD;
his'memory treasured the veriest trifles which were associated&#xD;
with her; and handed it over to his mother, who received it re-&#xD;
luctantly.&#xD;
" I feel sure she will choose this pair ; she cannot help observ-&#xD;
ing the faithful copy of her own design. I heard her tell Bertha&#xD;
she 'drew them herself, and I remember she worked them for her&#xD;
brother ; they were delicately done. I doubt if she is often per-&#xD;
mitted to please herself by any such adornments for her own&#xD;
wearing. I feel confident that with her -poetic,'artist-nature, so&#xD;
delicately appreciative, she cannot be lacking in any essential&#xD;
points. Love for me will bring out the tastes which have}thus&#xD;
far lain perdue ; and it shall be my care that she has leisure to&#xD;
live her own sweet life, and adorn mine. You saw how ny father&#xD;
liked her."&#xD;
"Very possibly," said madame, raising 'her eyebrows; "he-is&#xD;
not easily put out by disorder."&#xD;
"cHeis a noble gentleman," replied Otho, warmly.&#xD;
" He is, indeed," said madame, unmoved ; "your are quite right.&#xD;

Otho, annoyed as he was, could not help smiling. ,He admired&#xD;
his mother's round periods, as much as he did her handsomely..&#xD;
dressed, matronly person, her white hands, her abundant hair;&#xD;
and he came and "sat down close at her side, and took her hand-&#xD;
kerchief from her lap, and played with its embroidered corners,&#xD;
and passed the tucks through his fingers.&#xD;
"These are trifles, my son," continued madame, after a thought-&#xD;
ful pause ; "-but they embellish life if properly considered, or drag&#xD;
it in the dirt if neglected."&#xD;
"I feel all you say, mother," exclaimed Otho, tossing back her,&#xD;
handkerchief, and rising from his chair. "You are wise, you&#xD;
reason excellently, but my soul does not waver. I can only reply:&#xD;
if Christabel Goldsmith will have me for a husband, with all my&#xD;
faults, my chilly moods, and imperious temper, I shall be a happy&#xD;
man. Only promise what I ask you; be- a friend to the poor&#xD;
child who never has had any mother-tenderness. You are so strong&#xD;
and so good, you have so much power."&#xD;
" Thank you my son; assuredly my lovers are those of my own&#xD;
household."&#xD;
"Promise me, mother, to add one to the. number."&#xD;
I think if grave, proud Otho's acquaintances had seen him now,&#xD;
they would scarcely have known him for the haughty, masterful&#xD;
man they were used to call Dr. Groenveldt; his face and manner&#xD;
were humble and full of trust and confidence in his mother. She&#xD;
returned his look with a fond study-of the features she had seen&#xD;
changing from soft baby lineaments to proud manhood ; and with&#xD;
a reluctant sigh, against her inclinations, against her' better judg-&#xD;
ment, she gave her promise, and thus a' sort of sanction to his&#xD;
wishes.&#xD;
"And mother, I shall stay and fill the place of music master&#xD;
for you' this year."&#xD;
" What, abandon your plans ! I cannot think that best."&#xD;
"sNot'abandon---my plans can wait. I am resolved to have&#xD;

&#xD;
one yearof happiness before I cut loose from home forever. Re.&#xD;
member that in Germany I should still lack two years of major.&#xD;
ity, and I am content to be your boy a twelve month longer."&#xD;
After a moment's silence and debate with herself, Mrs. Groen-&#xD;
veldt answered cheerfully:&#xD;
"As you please, darling; your presence is always precious to&#xD;
us, and will be invaluable just now. I must own to you my&#xD;
weakness; a year's reprieve will make me happy," (and as if&#xD;
apologizing for her avowal,) "you have been so long in Leipsic,&#xD;
you know, my only son."  And she secretly hoped thatthe evil&#xD;
would cure itself, and that daily contact with a slovenly, careless&#xD;
girl, such as she believed Chris to be, were she never so highly&#xD;
gifted. must soon wear off the glamour which bound him; and&#xD;
she forced herself to listen to his lover's raptures far into the&#xD;
night, when she dismissed him with a mother's kiss and a fore-&#xD;
boding sigh, firmly determining to do her best both to new-model&#xD;
poor unconscious Chris to her pattern, and also to comfort and&#xD;
counsel Otho under her final failure, which she foresaw to be&#xD;
certain.&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER TWENTY-THIRD:&#xD;
THE SAPPHO KNOT.&#xD;
IT was immediately settled that Chandos should commence in&#xD;
the autumn as a pupil in the art school at Rosenbloom, and Chris&#xD;
was to enter the finishing establishment of Madame. As soon as&#xD;
it got noised abroad, Sabrina and Zoe decided to go also; and&#xD;
Belle Brandon dispatched a letter to her uncle, asking permission&#xD;
to finish there, it being the lost year of her school life. Then she&#xD;
persuaded Mrs. Williams to send Mary Ann, that. young spinster&#xD;
being to Miss Belle every whit as useful as the aphides to the ants,&#xD;
and not to be left behind. Thus arose fresh causes of intimacy&#xD;
between these young people, who looked gleefully forward to pass-&#xD;
ing a year under the same roof.&#xD;
But to return to the Josey. Chris's conversation with Otho de-&#xD;
termined her to do her best to be of the horseback party. Belle&#xD;
Brandon intentionally forgot her promise to come and help her,&#xD;
hoping that she would be obliged either to wear the habit as it&#xD;
was, or to stay at .home, and either horn of the :dilemma- suited&#xD;
the beautiful blonde, who, had besides enough to do to engineer a&#xD;
costume for herself. When Friday evening came and stillshe&#xD;
did not appear, Chris decided to carry her troubles to Ruth Blair,&#xD;
who came to her aid at once.&#xD;
Some sort of change has certainly passed over the little matron&#xD;
since first we met her. A sadder, graver face, a look of care or&#xD;
trouble, which Chris was. quick to discover, but Ruth refused to&#xD;
acknowledge, and as she set to work, she forced herself to be&#xD;
chatty, often, however, falling into absorbed silence. There was.&#xD;
(336)&#xD;
&#xD;
short time to accomplish the task,.but Ruth made the most of it ;&#xD;
she fitted the habit on to Chris's slim figure, took in the seams,&#xD;
and "pinched and pulled, and by the aid of " Wheeler &amp;amp; Wilson,"&#xD;
she pronounced it, at ten o'clock, as complete as it could be made.&#xD;
" If only I had time to cut off the tails, and pipe it around," she&#xD;
sighed. "You might wear a belt, but that looks awkward on a&#xD;
habit.- Why didn't 'you come sooner, Chris dear ? I could have&#xD;
taken it all to pieces and made it lovely, not that it looks ill now.&#xD;
Godey has something like it this month; who knows but. you&#xD;
have jumped into the fashion, and now that we have unloaded&#xD;
the beaver, and turned up the edge with my jet-and-gold brooch,&#xD;
you. positively do look well."&#xD;
." I am glad. I should like to be presentable. Now about the&#xD;
Sappho knot. Iuth, I wonder if I can manage it, how odd it&#xD;
seems that any one should care about my hair."&#xD;
"Very pleasant, I should say," answered Ruth with a soft sigh.&#xD;
" Attend as closely to my instructions as you do to your German,&#xD;
and I will ensure you success.. You "must tie your hair first you&#xD;
know, then hold it thus on your hand, and twist it so, bringing&#xD;
it around smoothly. There, see how nice it looks. It becomes&#xD;
you, rarely.&#xD;
"I think it does. How I wish it would stay put till to-morrow&#xD;
afternoon. I have a great mind to sit up all night, so as to keep&#xD;
it perfect."&#xD;
"Otho is extremely fastidious in his tastes. I wonder where&#xD;
he will find a wife who can please him; he demands perfection in&#xD;
women."&#xD;
"I hope he will not find one. I like him best as he is," said&#xD;
Chris, shortly.&#xD;
Ruthl smiled. ' There, said she, 'you can manage it easily&#xD;
enough I think.. Be sure to put in plenty of hairpins, put it up&#xD;
'I'l do my best dean. If only you could come and dress it for&#xD;
me."&#xD;
" What time do you propose starting?"&#xD;
"About twelve o'clock, I believe."&#xD;

" I cannot leave home at that hour," said Ruth with sudden&#xD;
gloom. "George has taken his Saturday afternoon to put in' the&#xD;
Limas, and I will not be absent."&#xD;
"Don't think of it," answered Chris, quickly. "I am sure I&#xD;
can get on myself. One more kindness added to all the rest, yet&#xD;
I don't feel them heavy."  She went up to her friend and kissed&#xD;
her fondly. " I bide my time to repay you. The wheel may&#xD;
bring me up high enough sometime. Good night, dear, dearest&#xD;
Ruthie. What ! eyes full of tears again ! I cannot bear to see&#xD;
them: sweet eyes! you know how to smile, don't cloud your&#xD;
brightness, your loving glances with tears."&#xD;
" Nonsense, child ! Your foolish speeches would draw tears&#xD;
from stones," said Ruth, dashing her hand across her face. "'What&#xD;
is it to you if my eyes I'm a-wiping.' There go now."&#xD;
" Well, I suppose I must," she looked around the room. "I&#xD;
love every inch of this place. Ruthie, you've been such a friend&#xD;
to me. My friend and comforter forsook me, and you took me&#xD;
up. I believe I shall come some day, and live here with you. I&#xD;
feel sure of it. Do you believe in presentiments ?"&#xD;
"No, I do not wish to believe in them," answered Ruth.&#xD;
" Well, I must go. Kiss me once more. Your's are mother&#xD;
kisses ; all I get. You are a pretty little mother. I wish I had&#xD;
a blood-right in .you ; you should tell me something. Good-night,&#xD;
little Husband, how soundly he sleeps."&#xD;
Rainbow followed Chris in at the door of the oak parlor, and&#xD;
sat down in the middle of the floor, and demurely washed his&#xD;
face.&#xD;
" The old cat and all1" ejaculated the widow. " Where'd that&#xD;
pesky rep-tile come from ?"            -&#xD;
" I suspect the garret window must have been open, mother,"&#xD;
said Chris, exchanging a funny look with Chardos.&#xD;
" What if 'twas, he can't fly can he ?" adjusting her glasses,&#xD;
she glanced at him as if she expected to discern folded wings&#xD;
beneath his great paws.&#xD;
"No mother, but he can jump."&#xD;
"The land sakes ! You don't mean to tell me, that that brute&#xD;

have thought he'd a been smashed- all to bits."&#xD;
" He is here, you see, in good preservation."&#xD;
" Well! I will give up! I believe he must be that kind that&#xD;
goes with a broom-stick."&#xD;
" Should'nt wonder, mother," laughed Chandy, who instantly&#xD;
comprehended the joke and hugely enjoyed it. "I've noticed that&#xD;
he always watches yours closely. Perhaps he expects to meet&#xD;
you out, some walpurgis night."&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER TWENTY-FOURTH.&#xD;
" Come up ye horses!&#xD;
Rage ye chariots."&#xD;
The riding party met by appointment at Brookside, not be-&#xD;
cause it was particularly central, but because my Lord Chandos&#xD;
willed it so. Belle came first, cantering gaily up, by the side of&#xD;
Mr. Hauxhurst, who had, also, Mary Ann Williams under con-&#xD;
voy. She was looking radiant in a habit of bottle green. A long&#xD;
ostrich feather floated out from her jaunty little cap of green&#xD;
velvet.&#xD;
'Twere long to tell, through how much weariness and vexatious&#xD;
management she had gotten together this tasteful outfit. The&#xD;
habit she had browbeaten Mary Ann into taking from    the&#xD;
Gonecusset store. The hat she madam from a spencer of her own.&#xD;
The feather she borrowed willy nilly of her hostess, but at last,&#xD;
here she was, all smiles and gaiety, putting far behind her all un-&#xD;
pleasant memories. She sprang lightly to the ground, and ran&#xD;
up the steps into the old oak parlor ; but disappointed in her hope&#xD;
of finding Chandos there, with whom she projected a short flirta-&#xD;
tion. The grim widow, clicking her needles, being the only oc-&#xD;
cupant, she gave her a musical " Good evening," and went un-&#xD;
ceremoniously up to Chris' room, where that poor child was ready&#xD;
to cry over the Sappho knot, which stubbornly refused to be made.&#xD;
'Bon jour, Chris dear," said she melodiously, and pushing her-&#xD;
self in between her and her mirror, to inspect her ringlets, trying&#xD;
to coax a wanderer into the ranks; she seized a long shell comb&#xD;
which lay in its semi-circular box on the toilette, saying coolly:&#xD;
"I'm going to break this, Chris, of course you don't 'care."&#xD;
(340)-&#xD;
&#xD;
Before Chris could speak it was snapped in twain, and the self&#xD;
ish girl was employing one of the pieces among her blonde locks.&#xD;
Chris darted her a look. The comb was her father's gift. She&#xD;
used to wear it in the old days when he loved her satiny curls.&#xD;
It had lain -perdue in its box, and therefore safe ever sinCe.' Chris&#xD;
had never put it quite out of sight. Though she bit het: lips,&#xD;
she said quietly:&#xD;
" You are easy in your manners, I think, Miss Brandon," and&#xD;
went on fixing and unfixing her long heavy hair, and all tb no&#xD;
purpose. She could not make it smooth.&#xD;
Ruth had done it a couple times, but to-day, it was obstinate&#xD;
and full of total depravity; the top was too large and the sides&#xD;
were frowsy.&#xD;
"What are you laboring at ?" asked Bele, turning about to&#xD;
watch her.&#xD;
"I want to make a Sappho knot."  Chris :dropped her arin,&#xD;
and rested them, gazing hopelessly -at her disheveled image.&#xD;
"A what ?" asked Belle, quickly.&#xD;
Chris could have beaten herself for allowing the words to slip&#xD;
out in her pre-occupation, and she answered a little tartly:&#xD;
'. I am trying to dress my hair, as perhaps you perceive, Miss&#xD;
Brandon.&#xD;
"Why don't you have a coil ?" Belle asked, after watching her&#xD;
a minute.&#xD;
"Because, in the fii'st place, I don't know how to make a coil;&#xD;
and -in the second place, I want this, and I intend to have it," said&#xD;
Chris, going to work again.&#xD;
" But a coil is prettier than a knot, Sappho knot, I think you&#xD;
called it," smiling meaningly in Chris' face.&#xD;
"You are in my light, I cannot see."&#xD;
Belle moved aside without showing the least anger, and fell to&#xD;
thinking. Here was Christabel Goldsmith, who never cared in&#xD;
the least about herself, and who'always wadded up-her hair in'the-&#xD;
easiest and quickest way,'obstinately bent upon a particular style&#xD;
of cofre. Ego, she 'had an object in view. She ministbe fry-&#xD;
ing to please somebody, at the particular request of that some-&#xD;

body. Yes it must be, because she of herself would never have&#xD;
originated such a wish ; of course it was a suggestion, plain as day,&#xD;
so she said.&#xD;
"I wish I was of consequence enough to be desired to wear&#xD;
my hair in ady particular way, I'd make my arms ache, and snub&#xD;
people too.".&#xD;
The burning blush which suffused Chris' face, satisfied the&#xD;
angler that she had caught her fish. It was a request, and she&#xD;
made a shrewd guess at the requestor, and looked wicked over it,&#xD;
malicious and envious both.&#xD;
" Let me do your hair," said she eagerly. I think if. Chris&#xD;
had looked into her eyes, she would. have refused, for she was&#xD;
very like the Geraldine indeed ; but her arms were tired, her pa-&#xD;
tience exhausted, and she despaired of success.&#xD;
" Well then, fasten it firmly," said she dropping into a chair,&#xD;
and surrendering herself reluctantly to her self-appointed tire.&#xD;
woman. "Ruth said it must be put up with plenty of hair-pins."&#xD;
" Never fear me, I think I can dress hair about as well as Mrs.-&#xD;
Blair. By the way, what's the matter with your friend."&#xD;
"Why," said Chris, suspiciously ; if she had looked up she&#xD;
would have seen Belle studying her face in the mirror.&#xD;
" Oh, nothing in particular, only I fancied she was rather&#xD;
quieter than she used to be, and even a little sad sometimes. Does&#xD;
that Achilles of her's ever dissipate ?"&#xD;
"No," answered Chris, " of course not, his habits are perfect."&#xD;
" Well, I did'nt know, those working men do sometimes get in&#xD;
bad ways I suppose. It would be a pity, he is a splendid speci-&#xD;
men-of a giant, is he not. I've a great mind to coax him away&#xD;
from her just for fun."&#xD;
" That won't do, it feels heavy and tumble-down," said Chris,&#xD;
who experienced the extremest disgust at that kind of talk, and&#xD;
was- at no pains to hide it.&#xD;
"It is quite firm I assure you, however. The style being dif-&#xD;
ferent, to:what you are-accustomed to wear gives it that feeling."&#xD;
".But it pulls. I don't like it so. I am afraid it will not stay,"&#xD;
&#xD;
persisted Chris, moving her head about as if she supported a&#xD;
cumbrous weight. "rIm sure it is, shaky.'&#xD;
" Well then, do let me stick it full of hair-pins, like a pin-cush-&#xD;
ion, and see if that will suit you," said Belle,- impatiently.&#xD;
" Come, hurry up, you females in the upper regions, only five&#xD;
minutes more," called out Chandos from the hall.&#xD;
" Three will suffice for us," answered Belle. While arranging&#xD;
her dimples in the mirror, her eyes lighted on a paper parcel,&#xD;
half open on the toilette.&#xD;
"Oh, what lovely gauntlets !" she exclaimed, rapturously seiz-&#xD;
ing them, "where did you get them? Not in Millville, I know,&#xD;
for I shopped everywhere. I wish Ihad a pair, gloves are so&#xD;
vulgar, with a habit. Why, there are two pairs, and those mono-&#xD;
grams, was there ever anything so sweet! May I just fit on this&#xD;
one*? I am sure they are exactly my size. Yes-I thought so,"&#xD;
and without waiting for Chris to answer, she drew both on, and&#xD;
seizing a promiscuous hair-pin, she buttoned them around her&#xD;
wrists, and drawing the cords with her teeth, she had them fast,&#xD;
patting the tassels admiringly.&#xD;
" "How puflicly delicious, as Dulcet says, such a lovely fit ! I&#xD;
declare I hav'nt seen such a glove in an age. Why, it looks as&#xD;
if it grew on my hand. How lucky that you have two pairs, and&#xD;
your quiet'taste would of course choose the plain ones. Know&#xD;
I am a wicked little witch to.dote on such vanities. We two&#xD;
shall rise sublime above the other girls, who shall, behold us with&#xD;
envy. 'Only you and I. It seems as if the world was made for&#xD;
only you and I."' Ne ce est pas mon ange ?  She hummed the&#xD;
melody in such clear liquid tones, that Chris ceased her dressing,&#xD;
and turned about, and gazed at her. Belle observed the odd&#xD;
glance, and instantly did a bit of the gushing-kissing her de-&#xD;
monstratively..-&#xD;
"I only hope I shall have something you will like as much as&#xD;
I do these gauntlets, sometime. It is so nice to oblige one's&#xD;
friends. Ah,.I see. you think with me ; such speaking eyes as&#xD;
you have. What was .it Mr. Hauxhurst compared them to? . I&#xD;

seen ladies borrow jewels and shawls and everything, but of course&#xD;
one could not permit common people to take the liberty of lend-&#xD;

Never had Chris possessed=any article of dress to which she&#xD;
attached'such value. Otho's friendly looks, and: his odd history&#xD;
of the glove, the gantlett. the handshoe, and the descriptions of&#xD;
their manufacture; and of the pretty Grisettes in the Paris shops&#xD;
.who fitthiem so daintily, had amused her much. It seemed like&#xD;
desecration to see them on Belle Brandon's hands.&#xD;
"I think I'll just run down now. I'm all ready you know.&#xD;
Such great characters as you Miss Goldsmith, should-have heralds&#xD;
to prepare their way." She hurried off and had reached the stair-&#xD;
case before Chris could speak.&#xD;
" Stop; Miss Brandon," she said, calling after her in a short de-&#xD;
cided voice. "I 1on't wish to seem disobliging, since you have&#xD;
been so kind about my hair."&#xD;
"Oh, don't mention such a trifle, you make me blush, really.",&#xD;
"I cannot permit you to wear my gloves. Please take them off&#xD;
directly."&#xD;
"Oh, but you must permit me, because possession is nine parts&#xD;
of the law, and you see I have got them," holding them provok-&#xD;
ingly up before their baffled owner's gaze.&#xD;
" Perhaps you have not observed my monogram on the back ?"&#xD;
"Indeed I'm not so blind, sweet forgetmenots ! They speak a&#xD;
tender language to my heart. They are all the more precious to&#xD;
your friend for that."&#xD;
"Be so good as to take them off without any more foolish talk,"&#xD;
said Chris, trying hard to keep cool.&#xD;
"I will, dear, if you will tell me where you got them."&#xD;
Chris colored high, and kept silence.&#xD;
"-I'll kindly spare your blushes, you precious child. You are&#xD;
quite flushed, do bathe your cheeks in magnolia water before you&#xD;
come down. So much red is not becoming to you. Au revoir,&#xD;
I'll say you are coming."&#xD;

The last half of' her objurgation was uttured:.solus, for Ielle&#xD;
had floated down the stair-case, and she heard her clear voice in&#xD;
high toned conversation with Chandy in the:hallh A ashe paused.&#xD;
and listened it sounded from the parlorin tunefulYgusts, and4ring-&#xD;
ing childish laughter.-. Chris tramped up and down, trying, to&#xD;
dominate her anger, and restrain her impulse .to run after her-and&#xD;
force her to give back her treasures&#xD;
" Oh,'what will Otho thinkof me," she exclaimed:'passionately,&#xD;
her eyes briming with angry tears. Again Chandos calledgimpa-&#xD;
tiently, and she was forced to-finish dressing, and {try to quiet her.&#xD;
self with"the resolve to tell her good friend the whole, story the&#xD;
first opportunity. " She shall not spoil my day if I can help it,"&#xD;
said she resolutely, and she made a violent effort.to clear her face,.&#xD;
and put away her anger, and she slowly descended the stairs, fit-&#xD;
ting the discarded gauntlets on toher hands which still trembled&#xD;
with passion; unconsciously turning- half aside her still stormy,&#xD;
eyes and averting her crimson cheeks. As soon as she appeared&#xD;
in the doorway, which framed her like a picture, Zoe held up her&#xD;
hands and exclaimed:&#xD;
" Well, I think wonders are beginning. Chris. Goldsmith ahead&#xD;
of us in fashion. Do look at her postilion."&#xD;
" What do you mean," spoke up Chris, ready to takeoffence;&#xD;
after her recent experience.&#xD;
"Just what I say. The new style of -waist. I meant to have&#xD;
one, but Miss Makenup did: not like. to undertake without what&#xD;
she calls her 'patron.' Is'nt the effect charming?"&#xD;
" Very," said1 Belle, aside to her foil and sir. Hauxhurst, drop&#xD;
the skirt and substitute yellow leathers, and she would look fit.to&#xD;

for a novelty, and questioned and admired, would hardly.believe&#xD;

shadow and heightened the beauty. Then she laughed lightly, and&#xD;
danced off to Chandos, before whom she performed an elaborate&#xD;

" Might it please you, Sir MC., to inform us when we are to&#xD;

"We are not all here yet," replied Peter, to whom a side-glance&#xD;
showed the inquiry to be really addressed.&#xD;
" Ah ! here comes Otho," said Chandy. " My gracious, what&#xD;
a splendid fellow Zephyr is. Looks gay though for a lady. I.&#xD;
hope you are sure of yourself, Chris."&#xD;
" I'm not afraid," replied she readily, "especially," she added'&#xD;
with a shy look at Otho, "as Dr. Groeuveldt has'promised both&#xD;
to take -care of Zephyr and to teach me to manage him."&#xD;
"Oh !" exclamed Belle, clasping her hands in real or affected "&#xD;
terror, " what a restless eye that creature has. 'If you should&#xD;
be thrown or dragged through the streets, how dreadful."&#xD;
Old Thomas, who had ridden Zephyr in from Craigenfelds in&#xD;
the morning, and who now held his head, heard the remark, not&#xD;
at all pleased, said quickly, lifting his hat to Belle :&#xD;
" You may calm your fears young lady, Miss Chris can ride&#xD;
Zephyr. Every body could not do it, he's a -smart fellow, and&#xD;
knows who he must obey."&#xD;
Zephyr seemed to feel that he was the subject of conversation,&#xD;
and stood pawing the turf with his little hoof, and glancing over&#xD;
his shoulder at Chris, as if he liked her looks.&#xD;
" Be so good as to keep your information till it is desired," said&#xD;
Belle, haughtily, much displeased at the quiet set down she had&#xD;
got.J&#xD;
Otho, meanwhile, had dismounted and tossed the bridle on&#xD;
Tramp's neck, and now stood by patting him, and he called to&#xD;
Thomas.&#xD;
" Certainly sir. I will see that it is attended to. You know&#xD;
Deb{worships her, and she'll be sure to think of- it. But Mr.&#xD;
Otho," he added in a low, respectful voice, as if asking a great&#xD;
favor, "let me put Miss Chris on sir,.if you please."&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S, DAUGHTER.             347&#xD;
" Why," questioned Otho, a little haughtily. "Do you doubt&#xD;
my skill'?"&#xD;
" No sir, not at all, sir, but Zephyr is notional as a Boston lady,&#xD;
and he must be started right, sir. lie's as kind as a dog, (patting&#xD;
his glossy neck,) a child might drive him with a thread, but I shall&#xD;
feel. better if I put Miss Chris on myself. I want to speak a lit-&#xD;
tle to her about managing him."&#xD;
"I don't at all see the 'necessity of that, Thomas," said Otho&#xD;
impatiently. " I propose to take care of Miss Goldsmith, and I&#xD;
profess myself quite equal to the task."&#xD;
"Well, just humor an old man for once, Mr. Otho. She was&#xD;
a little maid those times, and she was just the light of my eyes.&#xD;
I laid my sweet Bessie away under the daisies that spring, and&#xD;
I seemed to turn to her, me and Deb, we"'loved her like our&#xD;
blood."&#xD;
Otho stood aside immediately, and Chris, who had been wait-&#xD;
ing at a little distance, with her habit gathered up in her hands,&#xD;
for what she supposed final orders-from master to man-came&#xD;
forward now, ready for Otho to put her on. She flushed up scar-&#xD;
.let, and sent a quick inquiring glance from one to the other, when&#xD;
Thomas knelt and offered his hand, and Otho stood apart. She&#xD;
could not understand it, but she had little time to consider, for&#xD;
the nervousness of mounting before so many witnesses, who all&#xD;
ceased their talk to watch her, put all other thoughts out of her&#xD;
head.&#xD;
" My dear little lady," said Thomas, 'in a voice 'for her only,&#xD;
"there's a pair of wicked eyes beyant, would shine to see you&#xD;
leap short, or plunge over. Steady now, I've your pretty foot firm&#xD;
in my hand."&#xD;
She' accomplished the feat easily and gracefully, quite -to his&#xD;
satisfaction, and while he stood by her and adjusted the slipper,&#xD;
and arranged her dress; he added--&#xD;
"I hope you've not forgot the old lessons.. Settle yourself in&#xD;
the saddle, left hand well down, head up, straight and easy, bold&#xD;
and modest. Yes, yes, you do remember the fine bye-gones, and&#xD;
you such a bonny wee child. Zephyr is kind, Miss Chris, never&#xD;

feel fear of him, but he won't bear the whip. You must give him&#xD;
your confidence ; he loves to be trusted, he's young and frisky--&#xD;
and our good God keep you safe my child, and bless you forever&#xD;
and ever," said he with sudden emotion, touching his forehead as&#xD;
he gave the pretty animal his head, and stood aside.&#xD;
Never had Chris looked prettier. The excitement brought a&#xD;
deeper glow to her cheek, and the tender tremble in old Thomas'&#xD;
voice, while he recalled the dear childish pleasures, filled her eyes&#xD;
with softenedlight.&#xD;
She had forgotten Belle and, her doings. Everybody was kind,&#xD;
they praised her dress, nothing out of place or keeping there.&#xD;
Candy said 'she looked prime, as soon as he set eyes upon her,&#xD;
and waived his hand, and added:&#xD;
She is alive, behold&#xD;
Her eyelids ! cases to their heavenly jewels,&#xD;
Begin to part their fringes of bright gold."&#xD;
And she had to close his mouth with her hand to stop his non-&#xD;
sense, and the quotation then went on bubbling out of the corners,&#xD;
and his hand kept on waiving. The last voice she heard as she&#xD;
turned, Zephyr's head from the door-stone, was her mother's who&#xD;
sent a tender parting after her.&#xD;
"Now, Christabel Goldsmith, do take care of yourself, and&#xD;
don't go and break your bones, and come back all smashed to bits&#xD;
for me to nuss."&#xD;
Ignoring all Belle's coming strategy, Dr. Groenveldt placed&#xD;
himself at the side of the -one girl in the party who could attract&#xD;
him, and he scanned her with a pleased glance. She did not see&#xD;
the half shadow which swept 'across his face, when his eyes rest-&#xD;
ed upon her gauntlets. It was but an instant, and he said to him-&#xD;
self; "her quiet good taste has guided her to select the plain ones.&#xD;
It is after all as I would have it. My impressions of her are&#xD;
right, yes, she rare and lovely is to-day," and he proudly thought,&#xD;
how certainly his mothermust approve of her.&#xD;
In sweet content, Chris trotted on, and her rose-colored thoughts&#xD;
drifted toward the tall, dark man at her side. " How good, how&#xD;

noble he is, to interest himself so kindly in me. HowI do wish&#xD;
I could do something to prove my gratitude. The ride prQrnmied&#xD;
well to our, Chris, for after all, the sunshine must come from with&#xD;
in which gilds our surroundings.&#xD;
They were quite a dazzling party, riding down thelong street,&#xD;
and people paused to admire and wonder as they clattered past.&#xD;
Women came to the doors with their work, in their hands,. and&#xD;
from some cottages highly ornamented with children, who. fes-&#xD;
tooned all the windows, and swarmed up the fences, they were&#xD;
encouraged to " come up !" "Go it, two-forty on the plank road,"&#xD;
and "save their wind for the home stretch," and other horsey ad-&#xD;
vice, which, to judge by the contortions of.figure and countenance&#xD;
with which the juveniles accompanied it was highly enjoyable to&#xD;
them, whatever it may have been to the equestrians.&#xD;
Captain Slocum and Dulcet had not arrived till they were&#xD;
about starting, and he was in rather a biting humor, from having&#xD;
been made to wait, and had stood on one leg in Mrs. Pettibone's&#xD;
doorway, beating off her June roses with his whip, lending un-&#xD;
willing attention to the old lady's circumstantial relation of the&#xD;
.untimely end to which she had brought one of'her biggest geese,&#xD;
last picking time, by. holding it between her knees, while she&#xD;
stripped off its feathers.&#xD;
"I said, sekz I, lay still, Goosie, and after a few flops, I hope&#xD;
she did lay as still as a toad in a rock, and when I let up her, head,&#xD;
there she was, 'as limpsey as a rag. Eyes sot, no use doipg&#xD;
nothing."&#xD;
Here the Captain tramped, off to jerk. up the horses heads,&#xD;
leaving the good lady comfortably rocking and ambling on in her&#xD;
narration.&#xD;
" Jericho, if that female school ma'am is going to prink all day,&#xD;
I shall vamose the ranch."&#xD;
Dulcet came down at this point in his reflections, and explained&#xD;
in a mollifiying voice, as she mounted her steed:&#xD;
"I'm so pufficly fastigious in my style, Captain Slocum; I.wknob&#xD;
you can't object to that in a lady, and curls are such teazing&#xD;
things to hang. I do not go often on pleasure excursions, partic-&#xD;

ularly equestrian, but when I am invited by a gentleman who un.&#xD;
derstands himself and is discerning and appreciative, I like to be&#xD;
appropriately appointed; puffietly free from encumberment, and&#xD;
know that my tout ensemble is worthy of encomiastic mention, in&#xD;
order thoroughly and entirely'to surrender. myself to the full and&#xD;
absolute enjoyment of the festive'occasion."&#xD;
" If you've done reeling off those remarks, Miss Pettibone, I&#xD;
think we might as well be travelin." Though the Captain rather&#xD;
admired the spinster's long words as an unknown tongue, he was'nt&#xD;
going to let her find it out, and he threw himself across his beast,&#xD;
and started off on a hasty trot, saying curtly:&#xD;
"iNow -ma'am, let her quilt."&#xD;
Poor Miss Dulcet daral not show any indignation, and per-&#xD;
formed the journey in a series of bobs and bumps which she pro-&#xD;
nounced in spasmodic "utterances to be "pufficly delicious." It&#xD;
was patent that she had taken plenty of time in getting herself&#xD;
up, regardless of trouble. She had her curls done in at least a&#xD;
hundred and fifty little corkscrews on each side of her thin face,&#xD;
just the faintest soupcon of rouge on her cheeks, and the powder&#xD;
laid on so thick that it plastered her very eye-brows; her frills&#xD;
elaborately crimped, and her hat tied beneath her chin in spread&#xD;
bows to hide some deepish lines thereabouts, and her rail of a&#xD;
figure so pinched that every breath was an achievement. In her&#xD;
hat of domestic manufacture, and a gene-ral pinched pattern, she&#xD;
had mounted half a dozen cock's feathers plucked -from her moth-&#xD;
er's finest fowls for the occasion. She pointed them out triumph&#xD;
antly to the girls. " Godey has them in his last number, I thought&#xD;
I would lead the'style for you, being your teacher, and possessing&#xD;
more experience than most of you."&#xD;
The Captain 'had been for years a stock breeder on a Texas&#xD;
ranch, and the beasts which carried him and Dulcet, were a couple&#xD;
of thick legged, round-bellied, cow-ponies,'who had been trained&#xD;
to scour away like mad, over the prairies, and amongst -the jun.&#xD;
gles of the-chapparel, and head in the wandering cattle, and had&#xD;
fierce eyes, full of red veins in their restless ever tossing heads,&#xD;
like wild buffalos. But the Captain said they "were as gentle as&#xD;
&#xD;
Jerusaleni crickets," and they trotted along quietly enough to cor-&#xD;
roborate his rather rash assertion.&#xD;
Mr. Hauxhurst, George Blair's friend, had plenty of occupa-&#xD;
tion in escorting Mary Ann- Williams, who was dreadfully afraid&#xD;
of her steed, and kept her eyes fixed on his ears, and was cQU-&#xD;
stantly saying: " Oh dear, what is he going' to do now ?" every&#xD;
time he sneezed, or hook his head, and she clung to the pommel&#xD;
with both hands, and all her friend's stinging ridicule cpuld not&#xD;
force her to sit up and look like a lady.&#xD;
Chandy's school friend, Sam  Slaughton, had arrived in Mill-&#xD;
ville the day previous, both to see his chum and the Groenveldts,&#xD;
as he proposed trying the Art School in the autumn, and he&#xD;
joyously entered the arena as escort to Miss Brandon, whom&#xD;
Chandy set forth in'vivid description as the "blue eyed and beau-&#xD;
tiful," and very well satisfied he seemed with his venture, to&#xD;
judge by the close attention he gave her dimples, ringlets, and&#xD;
pretty speeches, which were all set forth for his benefit. Chandy&#xD;
took hold of her arm and told' her behind his hand, with his face&#xD;
about three inches. from hers:&#xD;
S" Good looking fellow, Belle, 'a merrier man, within the limit&#xD;
of becoming mirth, I never spent an hour's talk with-all,' stunning&#xD;
.relations,;lots of tin-worth hooking-fix your bait and I'll help&#xD;
you haul him in."&#xD;
This was in the oak parlor, while they waited, and Belle obeyed&#xD;
Chandos' instructions, and watched for success.&#xD;
" Now boys," said Chandy, "I'm grand marshal, and I'll ex-&#xD;
plain my tactics. We don't need to freeze to any of the girJs in&#xD;
particular, but we will use our inalienable right to pursue hap-&#xD;
piness, which belongs to us as citizens of our dear Republic, by&#xD;
circulating round."' Notwithstanding this explanation, Peter&#xD;
seemed .somewhat inclined to adhere to little Zoe Walsingham,&#xD;
who,:daring young:gypsey, had come out in a crimson velvet habit,&#xD;
and round cap of the same, set off by a white plume floating over&#xD;
her shoulder, and she so filled honest Peter's eye and absorbed his&#xD;
attention, that he had no words or smiles for any other. Thus&#xD;
handsome Chandy had Sabrina Bradshawall to himself. Her get&#xD;

collar and cuffs, fine and white, her "abbreviated stove-pipe" of a&#xD;

ing from her breast pocket, her exquisitely carved French whip,-&#xD;
artistically grasped in her firm little hand, and every breath of-air:&#xD;
brought his:pleased sense the faint perfume of wild violets&#xD;
which always floated about her. Sabrina -Bradshaw lived a rich,&#xD;
fullAround life of hefr own, and had vitality enough to spare, when&#xD;
her:friends wantedher. Her perfect vigorous organization made&#xD;
her independent of all fine lady ailments, and she could follow out,&#xD;
anyplan of action or pursue any amusement without the pay-&#xD;
ment in lassitude and headache which weaker constitutiorns have&#xD;
to suffer, and her help and smiles and thousand kindnesses were.&#xD;
lavishly bestowed upon all who needed them. A five mile walk&#xD;
was only play to her, with a winter bath in Echo, lake at its&#xD;
termination. She knew all about ,the farm, and always listened&#xD;
with interest to her father's talks with Peter, anad held opinions of&#xD;
her own upon soils and sub-soils, and;stock. Her father said she&#xD;
was just. the woman to be an old maid, being suff'ieent to herself,&#xD;
giving much to those around her, and receiving little, and he pri-&#xD;
vately believed that there was'nt a man living good enough for&#xD;
his quest nly daughter. She always gratified the exquisite tastes. of&#xD;
Sir John Chandos. Her dash and style, and-easy confidenlt grace&#xD;
inspired him, and he never was so genial, so mirth provoking as&#xD;
in her delightful neighborhood. Spicyr talk, smart repartee, quaint&#xD;
quotations, flew about, embellished by gay laughter&#xD;
The soft June air and sweet flower-smells; the'tinkling brooks,&#xD;
coyly hastening away from them; the rustic fence and old mossy&#xD;
walls which' shut in the capriious winding of, their road; the&#xD;
little bridges over which, they.noisily, clattered; the, delicious bits&#xD;
of view.they goton the hills, each'a picture and study; the spicy&#xD;
whjffs-of odor.their, hoof-prints crushed out of the young juni-&#xD;
pers and ground pines, (they rode many abreast here, and the&#xD;
utmost ones brushed: the trees with their garmcents); and above&#xD;
&#xD;
all, the. wood notes wild, of our dear bob-o-links: and brown&#xD;
thrushes, and the prolonged melody of our' cardinals who were&#xD;
out also on a gala, with the undertones of frogs and singipg tree-&#xD;
toads and buzzing insects, and the master harmony of the cease-&#xD;
less mad music of Roaring. River, all attuned into the majestic&#xD;
anthem of "unwritten music," arranged before the floods sang&#xD;
together. Very likely these young people could not- have anal-&#xD;
yzed their;pleasure; but unconsciously they were wrapped in sen-&#xD;
suous enjoyment, and the horses did their best also, tossing' their&#xD;
ringing head gear, chaffing their bits, to help out the spectacle.&#xD;
" Well, the horse is a noble animal !" said Chandy, taking off&#xD;
his hat and letting the windlift his heavy curls, as he gazed ad-&#xD;
miringly at Zephyr and Tramp ahead. of him.&#xD;
" What an exhaustingly original remark," laughed Zoe. " Don't&#xD;
you feel faint, Chandy ?  Do give him  a pepper lozenge, some-&#xD;
body."&#xD;
" Some ladies like toy-dogs, and some. dote upon cats, but as&#xD;
for me give "me a horse," exclaimed Belle gushingly,:to Sam&#xD;
Slaughton, in whom she discerned a true horse lover.&#xD;
"Very correct, Miss," remarked Captain Slocum approvingly.&#xD;
" There's difference in'tastes and in opinions,&#xD;
Some likes apples, and some likes inions';"&#xD;
feeling thatfhe:had struck a vein of philosophical poetry which&#xD;
must delight Miss Dulcet, the captain pulled up his shirt collar,&#xD;
planted 'his hand on his hip, and grinned 'at her.&#xD;
"Yes," said she, blandly bowing. "A quaint bit of' English,&#xD;
captain, quite Saxon, very forcible. . Do you. know I used.to suf-&#xD;
fer extreme torture in seeing horses whipped, till I came to reflect&#xD;
that they were pachydermatous animals, which somewhat con-&#xD;

-" 'Tip-top for school boys, as we might testify, eh, Sam," laughed&#xD;
Chandy.'&#xD;
"Ask Belle Brandon what- she thinks about it," called out&#xD;
Christabel suddenly, over her shoulder.&#xD;
The hit was so hard, and came from so unexpected a quarter,&#xD;
that Belle winced, and Chandy rode forward on purpose to tap&#xD;
Chris on the arm, and say-&#xD;
"'A hit! a very palpable' hit.' Expound, Chris, and accept my&#xD;
congratulations. Positively you made the 'Brandon blush; a feat&#xD;
I despaired of."&#xD;
" I 'hav'nt half paid her off yet," exp1qined Chris in a low aside;&#xD;
"but I can't tell you the story now; too long."&#xD;
"I'll bide my hour, then. In the meantime I must review my&#xD;
veterans ;" and whirling about he galloped up- and down past the&#xD;
couples, with his.hand in his breast, a la Emperor, the Uncle of&#xD;
the Nephew, trying hard to manage a difficult frown which should&#xD;
impart the necessary dignity to his fun-lighted face. Everybody&#xD;
greeted him with jokes and laughter,-but it is so easy to laugh&#xD;
when one is young.&#xD;
A fork in the.road' brought them in view of a steep hill, from&#xD;
which their course led them aside. They had not time to turn'&#xD;
their horses, however, before they espied an odd vehicle tearing&#xD;
at break-neck speed down the rough road. It was a little dog-&#xD;
cart, drawn by two' mouse-colored donkeys. While they were all,&#xD;
looking, and before they had time to exclaim, the little machine&#xD;
struck a big stone, and spilled out its human contents, and the&#xD;
steeds rattled and clattered frantically towards them, throwing up&#xD;
their heels in donkey hilarity.&#xD;
That's Pauline's team," exlaimed Sabrina, wheeling her horse&#xD;
to ride upto the rescue. Sam dismounted and caught the antic&#xD;
animals, who stopped short and uttered an ecstatic hee-haw, and&#xD;
then winked unremittingly on their audience, with one ear set.&#xD;
back and the other pointed up the hill at the two children, ,who had&#xD;
picked themselves up and were shouting and laughing down the&#xD;
steep way, brushing their garments as they approached.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Well, young ones! I call that ground and lofty tumbling,"&#xD;
said Chandy.&#xD;
"I think we did it splendid," spoke up Pauline. "Dick stood&#xD;
on his lead and summersetted over, and that's what you can't do.&#xD;
He's burst six buttons off his jacket, he, he, he ! And I, 'say,&#xD;
Dick, you've torn your pantaloons," (this last a confidence behind&#xD;
her hand.)&#xD;
".Look at your -own things, if it comes to that, Miss," replied&#xD;
Dick, very red, holding up her tattered skirt to view. "'.If you'd&#xD;
a let me drive as you ought to, we would'nt have tipped over.&#xD;
Girls don't know nothing about driving. I'm going home now."&#xD;
" No more girls don't, Dick. You shall drive the rest of the&#xD;
way," replied Pauline, smoothing him down with true feminine&#xD;
"tact. "'Come on, up hill, and let's see if .our, cart is broke.&#xD;
We'll keep behind them now, -and hear all the fun."&#xD;
"I should like to inquire whither you are bound, Miss Brad-&#xD;
shaw," asked Sabrina, "if I might be permitted such audacity."&#xD;
" We are going.up to Craigenfells to supper," said Pauline&#xD;
boldly.&#xD;
" Who invited you, pray?"&#xD;
"I invited Dick, and he invited me; did'nt we, Dick ?"&#xD;
"Why Pauline ! go home this instant. You must not think&#xD;
of such a thing," said Sabrina, half amused and half angry.&#xD;
"I don't think much about any of you except 'Chris ; we are&#xD;
going because she is. She looks so pretty, much prettier than&#xD;
any girl here ; don't she, Dick ?"&#xD;
Dick assented, highly tickled with Pauline's smartness, and ap-&#xD;
petizing with boy relish the good things he foresaw  Deborah&#xD;
would be sure to bestow upon them, for they were .no strangers&#xD;
in Uncle Alec's mansion.&#xD;
Otho, greatly amused, took off his hat and bowed low. "For-&#xD;

"If I only could have brought Gracie," i-emarked Pauline, with&#xD;

you awhile,=but you must whip up, because Beauty and Daisy&#xD;
are awful fast fellows; arent they, Dick ?"&#xD;
This unexpected addition to the party-increased the merriment,&#xD;
and the chattering couples rode on past the Hogsback, making a&#xD;
detour of four or five miles, which carried them through a Joiely&#xD;
road;where;the anemones were blooming on either side of the&#xD;
sheltered path overarched with tall elms, and- musical with wild&#xD;
brooklets;; and out ;thence into broad grassy meadows, where&#xD;
Robert o' Lincoln was telling his name, whirling and sweeping in&#xD;
rapturous enjoyment of the melodious utterance, and fully con-&#xD;
scious, (as what handsome husband is not,) of the admiration he&#xD;
excited in the heart of his faithful wife who was keeping house&#xD;
among the larches.&#xD;
C'hemin faisant, they came upon some cows peacefully feeding&#xD;
knee-deep among the buttercups, who glanced at them with their&#xD;
Juno eyes, and sent them a waft of their sweet breath, as they&#xD;
trotted past.. The noise and rout were nothing at all to them,&#xD;
and they dropped their noses again into th luscious food, obliv-&#xD;
ions and serene.&#xD;
Now the cow ponies saw opportunity to distinguish themselves,&#xD;
and true to their old training, Dulcet's mount took the bits in his&#xD;
teeth and scoured away, tossing wildly his shaggy mane, intend-&#xD;
ing to head off the herd and worry them in somewhere, though&#xD;
where he had decided -upon locating them did not yet appear.&#xD;
Poor Dulcet went bobbing up and down, now here, now there,&#xD;
like an eggshell on a water-jet; now off, now on, now  one&#xD;
side, now the other ; cows ahead, making good time, pony lying&#xD;
out to his work, running prime, arid 'all in"such a mix-up that you&#xD;
couldn't have told whether Dulcet was riding a cow and driving&#xD;
a pony, or hanging on to 'a pony and:chasing a cow. The cock's&#xD;
feathers glanced here and glittered there, and -the pink ribbons&#xD;
&#xD;
fluttered like flags of danger. She "abandoned the reins ,aud lung&#xD;
desperately to the saddle bow, too much frightened even ,to scream,&#xD;
and after a race which beat Cowper's Gilpin all hollow, the turn-&#xD;
ing saddle deposited her safely and plumply among the. tall grass&#xD;
unhurt,- but somewlpt disheveled and awfully scared.&#xD;
"=Jerusalem  crickets !"- ejaculated the captain; " there: goes&#xD;
Pug with that female schoolma'am," and spurring after her in hot&#xD;
haste, he took his turn in heading off, entreating, exhorting, ce-&#xD;
manding Pug to "whoa" in every inflection of which the Poten-&#xD;
tial mood is capable, and 'got up with his last gyration just in&#xD;
time to throw himself very neatly at Miss' Dulcet's feet, inquiring&#xD;
eagerly if she was hurt, as he cleared her in a flying leap.&#xD;
" I think not," she replied, gasping and swallowing, and clutch-&#xD;
ing the long grass. She raised her eyes to his face, and seeing the&#xD;
real anxiety there, she secretly exulted, and prepared to faint&#xD;
gracefully as soon as he should raise her up. "I -don't think i've&#xD;
broken any bones, captain," (she accepted his proffered hand;)&#xD;
" but oh dear, Captain Slocum, what an' escape I've had. I'm&#xD;
dreadfully overcome," and she dropped her head upon his breast,&#xD;
-sobbing and panting.&#xD;
" Jerusalem crickets ! oh, bless tny soul! don't now," exclaimed&#xD;
the captain, wriggling about and rolling his eyes from side to side&#xD;
in ludicrous perplexity. " Oh my, do come to, please, can't you ?&#xD;
there's a dear."&#xD;
"Such an escape, captain!" murmured Dulcet. " I canehardly&#xD;
bring myself to contemplate it. Let me be thankful!"&#xD;
"Yes, so do," said the captain; " that's right"' Then he&#xD;
looked at her, and was fired by sudden emotion and the cpwven-&#xD;
ient proximity of the female head. A new situation for, the;cap-&#xD;
tain, but he rose equal to the occasion, and after ,glancing about&#xD;
to make sure that no one of the party could see, he imprinted a&#xD;
fervent kiss upon the virgin cheek, and straightened up with, a&#xD;
jerk and grinned,.well pleased with his performance.&#xD;
"There now, Miss Pettibone ! I've done it. Blame the cow&#xD;
pony ! No, I don't mean that,.of course. Y u uaust let ,ie look&#xD;
after you now. What I've kissed I'll take, and you see.if I"dpn't&#xD;

do it up brown. Let not man put asunder, and so forth. You&#xD;
sense me, I expect?"&#xD;
"I believe I do," replied Dulcet sweetly, blessing the steed, who&#xD;
was still tearing about the meadow, keeping the innocent bovines&#xD;
at top speed.&#xD;
"Set down on that there flat stun, Miss Pettibone, and I'll soon&#xD;
catch them blasted critters. I knew they'd bear watching,-but I'&#xD;
did'nt suppose they'd be playing off any of their old chapparel&#xD;
tricks up here amongst the Yankees. - You sure you aint hurt no&#xD;
where, ma'am?"&#xD;
" Quite sure, captain," replied Miss Dulcet, expressively. "I'm&#xD;
doing nicely, thank you."&#xD;
Jan Vedder came across the meadow and helped the captain,&#xD;
who soon secured the treacherous beasts, and Uulcet mounted&#xD;
her's with a resolution not to make a fuss, which was truly heroic,-&#xD;
and once more they set forward.&#xD;
These episodes of the donkeys and the cow ponies had so' dis-&#xD;
turbed the epic, that the horses got restive, and Sabrina's little&#xD;
sorrelmare, in crossing a clattering -old bridge, dashed forward&#xD;
impatient of curbing. Knowing her well, her mistress gave her&#xD;
her head, and sending Otho and Chris gay good evening as she&#xD;
passed,' she cantered easily on, but not long alone, for Sam&#xD;
Slaughton soon joined her. In the general mix-up, Captain Slo-&#xD;
cum took opportunity to ride up to Miss Brandon, whom he con-&#xD;
sidered very handsome, and had long admired afar off, wishing a&#xD;
little longer to use his butterfly'wings before subsiding into a use-&#xD;
ful family beast.&#xD;
"Confound this"old plug !" said Chandos, trying to pull on his&#xD;
horse and come up 'with Sabrina. But Miss Bradshaw's mare&#xD;
was selected by-Peter pere, who was as great in horse-flesh as-in&#xD;
farming, and she had her pedigree framed, and cost a pile of&#xD;
money. Poor Chandy's -mount was only a livery nag, showy to&#xD;
look at, but puffing with chest-founder, and without any go in&#xD;
him, and he could'nt do it.&#xD;
"You see," called 'out Captaig. Slocum, with a great "haw,&#xD;
haw,"- "you see, Goldsmith, your hoes keeps his feet too long on&#xD;

the ground, and when a hoss does that he can't ever travel fast&#xD;
--that's what the matter is."&#xD;
' Chandy gave up his attempt with an impatient anathema, and&#xD;
wheeled about and rode down abreast of Belle, who looked tri-&#xD;
umphant.&#xD;
" Captain Slocum, I've dropped my whip," called out Miss Dul-&#xD;
cet. She.had no idea of abdicating so soon, and thus recalled&#xD;
]dim to his allegiance.&#xD;
"Jerusalem crickets ! what a female schoolma'am that is,"&#xD;
grumbled the captain, as he dropped behind, with the glamour&#xD;
of Belle's charms over him to that extent that he half changed&#xD;
his mind about Dulcet.&#xD;
"Believing, we rejoice to see that curse remove," said Belle to&#xD;
Chandy. He turned and gazed at her in surprise, right into her&#xD;
steel blue eyes, which never quailed for an instant, and then he&#xD;
burst into a loud laugh. Though he felt how unfeminine it was,&#xD;
and would have been disgusted with Chris if she had said it, this&#xD;
girl looked so wickedly handsome, and her merriment rang out&#xD;
so careless and clear, that he stopped, fascinated, to hear what she&#xD;
would say next. Therefore she counted that her venture had&#xD;
netted her a paying profit, and she was bewitchingly simple and&#xD;
brilliant by tnrns, keeping watch out of her artless -eyes for the&#xD;
effect.&#xD;
Now there was one pretty honest young face in the cortege&#xD;
'which did not look at all happy, but on the contrary, quite. cast&#xD;
down and disconsolate. Bertha Groenveldt had -fallen to the&#xD;
share of Jan Vedder, that arrant scapegrace, who had no proper&#xD;
respect for grey beards and college rules, and she felt especially&#xD;
ill-used. Chandy had offered himself as her escort when the ex&#xD;
cursion was planned, and had spoken of it as a -matter of course&#xD;
ever since, and now he had not only ridden off by Sabrina's side,&#xD;
but paused by Belle afterwards, forgetful of her existence.&#xD;
Jan was an admirable horseman, his faults arising from his com-&#xD;
panionable termper, though 'tis a pity to have to say that they&#xD;
were fast sinking into vices, as his sunken cheeks and hollow eyes&#xD;
witnessed against him. He -was a favorite among the girls, as&#xD;

&#xD;
such.scapegraces; sometimes are, and had a brotherly, confidential,&#xD;
innocent way, which easily secured confidence.  Miss Bertha&#xD;
scarcely looked at him. Forgetful of her proper training, her&#xD;
politeness failed her, and she felt cross at. his attempts to be&#xD;
agreeable, which thus fell flat and unappreciated. Poor Jan, who&#xD;
knew better than any one else how far he had gone astray, and&#xD;
who had times of bitter self-upbraiding and repentance, watched&#xD;
her more in sorrow thatrin anger.&#xD;
Bertha's eyes were fixed upon the showy pair in front.of them.&#xD;
Much as she admired Sabrina's elegance, and dearly as she loved&#xD;
her, it was hard to witness Chandy's devotion, careless and lordly,&#xD;
and hear their voices in pleasant, friendly chat; but Belle Bran-&#xD;
don she could not like, and her little heart sank within her when&#xD;
Ase was preferred, and she began to say to herself how very&#xD;
pleasant-it would be to go home and be quiet, with her dear papa&#xD;
who loved her so very fondly-better, ever so much better,,than&#xD;
stopping here, a stranger and outsider among these young people,&#xD;
who were all old friends together, and would not miss her. This&#xD;
excursion, which she had been lying awake to think about,.was a&#xD;
bore and a weariness, and she wished it well\ over.&#xD;
But Chandy had not forgotten her. He was making the most&#xD;
of his party, of pleasure, after his long confinement within doors- -&#xD;
sipping all the sweets. Finding himself conveniently near, to&#xD;
Sabrina, with his usual insouicence he took a fancy to tarry by&#xD;
her side; but Bertha also greatly satisfied my lord-"with her-lady-&#xD;
like quiet andserene goodness, embellished by graceful cultiva-&#xD;
tion ;-and after Sabrina had cantered away, and Belle's dimples&#xD;
began to .be an old story, he turned 'ground to look for her, and&#xD;
seeing how downcast and absent her face was, though he was no&#xD;
vainer than other handsome boys, he could not help guessing the&#xD;
cause; and the .interrupted Miss Brandon in one of her dazzling&#xD;
effects, thus abbreviating her triumph:&#xD;
"Excuse me a moment ; I must ride back a little." He bowed,&#xD;
and turning his horse, he trotted down and ordered Jan to take&#xD;
the vacated place, which he was quite willing to do, and ChaAdy&#xD;
wheeled in by Bertha's side.&#xD;
&#xD;
" I'vebeen thinking of you," said he ; (it was not necessary to&#xD;
say how recent. the thought was,) "but you see Pete and I are, a&#xD;
kind of field-marshals without any batons, and we have-to make&#xD;
ourselves exceedingly numerous in order to discharge our duties&#xD;
with fidelity; but I've got where I like to be at last, and' you'll&#xD;
let me stay, won't you ? and we will have a nice little joke-to-&#xD;
gether."&#xD;
Bertha's face did not clear immediately, but she liked Chandy&#xD;
so much that it was not a hard task for him to get forgiven.&#xD;
" How good those brakes'smell! Isn't thisgay ? it makes one&#xD;
wish he was a boy again, 'in the cot where I was, born,' and :the&#xD;
rest of it, doesn't it?  I say, Bertha, have they got any} good&#xD;
horses up at Rosenbloom ?"&#xD;
"I'm afraid not any very showy ones; there's the family span,&#xD;
and the cart horses, and old Blunderbore, and the colts and the&#xD;
riding-master brings half a dozen every spring, but he takes them&#xD;
away again when the lessons are over."&#xD;
" That may do very well for Mr. Riding-master's pupils,:but&#xD;
they won't serve us. I I shall make mother get me a nag, because&#xD;
'I intend to take you out driving; I'll have two and a curricule;&#xD;
that'll be hunky-dory."&#xD;
"Oh what lovely dog-roses !" exclaimed Bertha, with a clear&#xD;
smile. r She began to discover beauties in the landscape, which&#xD;
had been a blank sere and drear when unlucky Jan invited her&#xD;
attention thereto. "I shall beg dear Chris to come out and bot-&#xD;
anize."&#xD;
"So we.will.; they are gay, that's a fact.&#xD;

I'll come along ; I'm great on botany; and I'll carry the cuincu-&#xD;

left, behind, and testified his feelings by making little jumps and.&#xD;
sideway prancings, andshaking his shapely head, and Chris being&#xD;
taken unawares, and in the midst of an absorbing conversation,&#xD;
had much trouble to keep. her seat. Otho's first impulse was:to&#xD;
grasp- her rein, but obeying some.secret resolve, he withheld- his&#xD;
touch and watched her closely, ready to offer assistanceif 'needed.&#xD;
But with voice and hand she soon brought gay Zephyr to consent&#xD;
that she might be; mistress, and. 'he subsided, but, with, much,&#xD;
champing of the. bitt, arching of his glossy neck, and tossing.off'&#xD;
flecks of. foam, as if' he knew his, power, and. disdained to use it&#xD;
unchivalrously against, such a slight, pretty young creature, who&#xD;
gave himn her.confidence, and whose command was but a tuneful&#xD;
request.&#xD;
Chris's heart., began. to pit-pat its steady. time-beats.again, in-&#xD;
stead;of knocking at her breast like an affrighted prisoner. But&#xD;
alas ! the first wild jump had loosened the treacherous hair-pins,&#xD;
and disarranged Miss Brandon's: slightly constructed' coiffure, so&#xD;
that it'fell to one -side, and looked-each instant more uncertain, dis-&#xD;
ordered, and frowzy. Belle, who had all the while been watching&#xD;
for. such a consummation, now left Jan Vedder, and: rode fo -&#xD;
ward, as she said, to assist "dear Chris, who was in trouble,".&#xD;
pointing at. her with the. handle of her whip, and smiling comr&#xD;
passionately..&#xD;
"Poor child, she never is. presentable, unless some of. us look&#xD;
after. her;j it is an act of.charity and mercy, and Dr. Groenveldt&#xD;
is so afraid of being ridiculous."&#xD;
This, though addressed.. to Jan, was said in that distinct under-&#xD;
tone which is more dauible than ordinary conversation, particu-&#xD;
larly when the sense is quickened by hearing ones own name.&#xD;
Mr. Otho's frowns gathered blackness, and some very disagreea-&#xD;
ble reflections obtruded themselves.&#xD;
Miss Brandon-checked herhorse with a quick, graceful motion&#xD;
chose. byChris's side, and said in her clepr, childish, voice, while&#xD;
she leaned over and pretended to arrange the tangling mass,&#xD;
iughing.prettilyat her file  rts&#xD;

itation:. What a pity that, this- Sappho knot, which' I'heard such&#xD;
sweet'things about, and which was wrought among so many smiles&#xD;
and sighs, is getting disheveled. It is a delicate thing to manage,&#xD;
Mr. Groenveldt ; if I might advise, I would say, ask something&#xD;
simpler next time. Girls who are all mind, like our dear 61d&#xD;
Chris, never ought to attempt that style. They should be content,&#xD;
to leave such va cities to us poor wicked little wretches, whose&#xD;
souls are just' equal to the trouble of looking our 'prettiest, and'&#xD;
who dote upon dress and sicean trifles."&#xD;
Under this double stab poor. Chris sat dumb; her large'eyes&#xD;
openedin unbounded astonishment upon the unblushing beauty,&#xD;
who tossed off her blonde curls, and showed her' sharp white&#xD;
teeth, in the-most careless, artless laugh imaginable.&#xD;
Otho glanced from one to the other in displeased surprise. So&#xD;
his Sappho had made his request the subject of a confidence.with&#xD;
this blue-eyed flirt. Besides: being careless she was 'indiscreet.&#xD;
Yet he could scarcely believe it:; she was always so very self-con-&#xD;
tamed, so extremely reticent. His mother's words clouded his&#xD;
face with gloom: "You would 'not like to present your wife to&#xD;
your frien is with her hair dressed. as if the mocked sport of a&#xD;
whirlwind," and poor Chris did .look very like that just dow-very&#xD;
indeed; and yet she was charming, with her blazing eyes, and&#xD;
crimson cheeks, albeit her attitude was hostile, and her air stormy&#xD;
and threatening. One thing he, man-like; decided;; she deserved&#xD;
to be punished. He had a right to be offended, \and the more he&#xD;
noted. how proud and rebellious she.looked, the more he desired&#xD;
to bring her down by a little wholesome discipline: Therefore&#xD;
he leaned. across her, and not very politely began' atconversation&#xD;
with Miss Brandon, laboriously flattering and particular. She&#xD;
nimbly met him half way, with all her graces in full action-&#xD;
though she saw through. his motive as plainly as if he had-writ-&#xD;
ton it, onhis forehead, and fully' appreciated the false ring of the&#xD;
coin he offered her. If Chris was teazed and annoyed she was&#xD;
satisfied, Two or three times she jestingly address'ed hor,abut&#xD;
the offended girl disdained to:reply, even by.a hok, and rode' on&#xD;
gazing straight between her horse's ears, her anger bubbling and&#xD;

boiling, and waxing hotter. I cannotundertake to affirm that&#xD;
Miss Brandon would have been glad to see Chris pitched over&#xD;
Zephyr's head, and picked up bruised and. bleeding ; but I feel&#xD;
safe in saying that she would have welcomed with secret delight&#xD;
a good- awkward tumble, upon some harmless, soft mud, which&#xD;
should make her exquisitely ridiculous, and no bones broken; a&#xD;
theme for a.good fling at her afterwards, and which would thor-&#xD;
oughly spoil her day, and make her wish she had never been&#xD;
born. . She resented Chris's utter indifference to her blandish-&#xD;
ments, her superior style, and society talk ; and she chafed under&#xD;
her quiet handling of themes, whose alphabet she had not learned.-&#xD;
Otho's unobtrusive, grave devotion, so patent' to everybody but&#xD;
the unconscious object, was gall and wormwood to dear Belle, the&#xD;
innocent child. It is not too much to say, she hated the two de-&#xD;
voutly..-&#xD;
Chandos, cantering up in his official capacity of batonless field-&#xD;
marshal, was just in time to hear her say, writhing under Chris's&#xD;
lofty, scornful looks:                 ~-&#xD;
"Dearest beauty, on the one thousand and oneth page of the-&#xD;
sixteenth book of etiquette, which I commend to your careful&#xD;
perusal, you will find this rule clearly laid down: 'Never stare&#xD;
your friends out of countenance.' Pray what is it in poor little&#xD;
me which makes you opan your eyes so wide at the same time,&#xD;
Vous ne paraisser pas faire attention d ce que je vous dis."&#xD;
"I was thinking," replied Chris, slowly, "how very like you&#xD;
are to-a picture I.know. If you had sat for the character it could&#xD;
not have been more perfect."-&#xD;
"Oh, thank you, dear; you quite take me by surprise. I had&#xD;
no idea you could bend your tongue supple enough to pay coin-&#xD;
pliments."&#xD;
"Ah cela depends!1" broke in Chandy, who saw that Chris was&#xD;
dreadfully aggravated. " You remind me of an old story'; shall I&#xD;
tell it you?"&#xD;
"I am quite sure that Mr. Goldsmith will embellish an old tale.&#xD;
in the new telling,". replied Belle, uneasily, for Chandy- looked&#xD;
dangerous.&#xD;
&#xD;
Aw, thus encouraged," said that young gentleman, caressing&#xD;
an imaginary moustache, -"well then, 'lend me your ears.' A&#xD;
man said to his friend, ' Come home with me, Tom, and dine; I&#xD;
must show you my wife ; she's as handsome as a picture.' Tom&#xD;
accepted the invitation, and after dinner was finished, and the two&#xD;
sat over their wine, the husband said, rubbing his hands:&#xD;
' Well Tom,-isn't she as handsome as a picture ?'&#xD;
'Oh yes, certainly, but-&#xD;
'But what ?'&#xD;
' Why you see, Dan, there's a deuced sight of odds in pictures.'&#xD;
Au revoir, Miss Brandon; duty calls me from your charming&#xD;
smiles, in whose moonlight I could bathe my soul forever !" and&#xD;
lifting his cap, he wheeled about and galloped back to Bertha,&#xD;
who had been all the while watching him, and thinking about&#xD;
him, 'and wondering what he was saying to Belle Brandon, and&#xD;
when he would come back to her again.&#xD;
As for the blonde, she was very angry ; decidedly she was not&#xD;
getting the best of the Goldsmiths in words to-day ; and the quiet&#xD;
smile with -which Otho listened to Chandy's nonsense galled her,&#xD;
She longed to punish somebody, and Chris, who could not help&#xD;
looking -at her, any more than a bird can help watching a snake,&#xD;
felt nervous and chilly under the Geraldine glances she shot at&#xD;
her..- In adjusting her cuff, Belle managed to. treat Zephyr to a&#xD;
smart little cut with her whip, which so astonished him, coming&#xD;
as it appeared from.his gentle mistress, for whom he was looking&#xD;
his prettiest, that he gave a sudden bound, and would have un-&#xD;
seated her had she not been very firm in the saddle. Stung by&#xD;
the idea that she had withdrawn confidence, he took -the bitts in&#xD;
his teeth, and began to prance sideways, and canter with the&#xD;
wrong ,foot, and otherwise comport himself like a horse cut&#xD;
loose from chivalric responsibility.&#xD;
Engrossed as Mr. Groenveldt was with Miss Brandon's many&#xD;
graces, he stopped in the middle of an elaborate sentence when&#xD;
Zephyr started, and he'watched Chris with compressed lips and&#xD;
anxious frown during his fearful- evolutions, and his face was&#xD;
many shades paler than usual when the enterprising creature&#xD;

tried the experiment'of making. a biped 'of .himself by standing&#xD;
on his hind legs and pawing the empty air with his. fore feet-; and;&#xD;
he drew a long breath when Chris showedthat she was fully mis-,&#xD;
tress of the situation, and brought Zephyr back to his proprieties,&#xD;
and sat firm and collected, without any fear in her still-determined&#xD;
face.&#xD;
" Shall I make myself 'responsible for Zephyr's future:good&#xD;
behavior by riding up and taking your leading-string, Miss, Gold-&#xD;
smith ?"&#xD;
Otho felt a curious desire to provoke her as soon as the danger&#xD;
was over.&#xD;
"No;" said she ; "Zephyr would resent such interference as&#xD;
much as ."&#xD;
"He is rather restless yet, though,; I am afraid you will come&#xD;
to grief. You had better be modest and permit yourself 'to be&#xD;
guided," said Belle, her eyes full of wicked light. "Now don't&#xD;
rashly turn your back 'on your friends;. we shall take it bitterly-&#xD;
to =heart if you under-value us to that extent."&#xD;
'If Zephyr despises double-dealing and trickery half as much&#xD;
as I do, he will be glad to leave you; you see he -says sQwas&#xD;
plainly as he can.; we have been already too long in the way of&#xD;
your' very interesting, spirited conversation." . Her, eyes well&#xD;
opened, and her lips arched,:she met Mr. Otho's weighing up look&#xD;
full and fearlessly, and touching her cap with her whip in a mock&#xD;
salute, she said: " Timon' -will - be Timon's friend hereafter;-&#xD;
Zephyr and-I are sufficient to each other."&#xD;
Chris would not have believed that morning that she could&#xD;
have felt such passionate anger as now ' boiled within her. No&#xD;
feeling but reverence for her best friend had ever found place in&#xD;
her soul 'before;.even impatience:would have seemed like pre-&#xD;
sumption. She fully believed that:Belle had intentionally brought&#xD;
her into disgrace-she was gloating over it now. But Belle's&#xD;
'achievements faded into the dim distance when compared with&#xD;
Otho's {looks and words. She was misunderstood, undervalued,&#xD;
and shamefully treated. He could believe that she could make&#xD;
his 'sacred:wishes the theme-of conversation with Belle Brandon,&#xD;
&#xD;
of all others! could doubt 'her truth; suspect heirof indiscretion.&#xD;
Indignation possessed her soul, and she dashed a couple of tears&#xD;
from 'her eyes, as she rode forward alone"; and Belle'slight, childish&#xD;
laugh rung out sweet and tuneful on the air.&#xD;
There had, not been a word said among the party during Chris-&#xD;
tabel's conflict ; but now a congratulatory murmur greeted her 'vic-&#xD;
torious horsemanship, 'and they all supposed she was carrying out&#xD;
a frolic and those who knew her best :smiled admiringly at' her&#xD;
unwonted spirits.&#xD;
Singularly enough, Mr. Groetveldt, in spite of her hard words&#xD;
and high looks, made up his mind that he would forgive her, and&#xD;
graciously receive her back into fvor, after a suitable time; and&#xD;
h6 watched her erect, lithe, slender figure, swaying in supple&#xD;
abandon to 'her steed's motion, with secret exultation; and a grave&#xD;
smile lighted his 'efes. U e was not sorry he had brought her out&#xD;
in a new phase so very becoming, in spite of her dishevelment.&#xD;
As soon as Jan Vedder saw her cantering on so gaily, easily&#xD;
passing Sam Slaughton and  Sabrina, who got no reply to their&#xD;
Merry challenge, he felt . 'desire to 'experiment 'pon Chandy's&#xD;
theory of 'circulation, and put up his horse to join her'; and he&#xD;
also flew past 'Sabrina, who had much trouble 'to -keep her nare&#xD;
from joining in the mad gallop.&#xD;
Chris had never spoken to Jan till this afternoon, and any other&#xD;
time she would have 'kept silence in his 'company. - Now she&#xD;
greeted him with a gay laugh, and 'exerted herself to make talk;&#xD;
and after 'a 'quarter of a 'mile 'or so of fast riding, they reined in&#xD;
their horses; 'and so interested were they in theii' conversation.&#xD;

Mr. Groenveldt ,I am too outspoken. I can never keep my faults&#xD;
in the background. I see you disapprove of me. Don't lay up&#xD;
nfiy folly against 'me. I'm' only-a child after all."&#xD;
lie bowed over the little fingers; extended towards him, which&#xD;
he could do no less than to take into his own, and afterwards di-&#xD;
rected an odd glance at the gashing blue eyes swimming in tears,&#xD;
andsomehow he was reminded of the fairy changeling, who so wrung&#xD;
poor Alice Leremont's motherly heart.-&#xD;
"Chris is a lucky girl, Mr. Groenveldt, not like your sister&#xD;
Bertha, of course, none of us . an hope for such perfection, but&#xD;
really, 'she is, a dear good creature, with all her gaucharie,&#xD;
which is trying 'a little to us girls at times, but we all study to&#xD;
niake the best of her. :She won't ever be any different to .what&#xD;
she  is, but-such anintellectas she has, such rare powers, excuse&#xD;
everything. °Ipity exquisite Chandy sometimes. (laughing.) I have&#xD;
seen him writhe when he looked at her. I imagine she will fall&#xD;
heir to a blessing-to-day, when he takes in the full sense of her&#xD;
appearance."&#xD;
'-When Belle commenced her speech, Christabel's first impulse&#xD;
was to turn on her, and if she had given way, and permitted one&#xD;
word to pass her lips ; if she had even looked at her, there is&#xD;
no 'saying where her passion might have carried her, but with a&#xD;
mighty effort, 'she: kept her eyes straight before her, and Jan's&#xD;
dykes and.pollards, and Vandykes mixed into, a confused jumble&#xD;
in her ears.The final allusion to Chandy suffused, her eyes with&#xD;
bitter tears: They were nearing Craigenfells now, and she could&#xD;
hardly keep herself from dashing' away at a mad, pace, and hid-&#xD;
ing from them all in the' deep sheltering wood, which rose leafy&#xD;
and inviting on her right hand.&#xD;
"'Of course after such a display of horsemanship .s we have&#xD;
witnessed today, it would, be superfluous to ask you if you can&#xD;
&#xD;

leap fences," said Jan, pointing to a high gate before them. - "The&#xD;
question would be, could you choose thus to distinguish yourself."&#xD;
"Yes I could," answered Chris, excitedly. " I should like to&#xD;
do anything that would nearly kill me, and frighten everybody to&#xD;
death. Come bring up your horse, and start fair, and see who&#xD;
will be first over."&#xD;
He opened his eyes in astonishment. "Are you in earnest Miss&#xD;
Goldsmith ?"&#xD;
" Of course," said she, gathering up her reins, " don't be slow;&#xD;
give, the word, one, two, three and away. I only wish it was ten-&#xD;
barred instead of five."&#xD;
Taken aback, by no means sure of his steed, Jan gallantly&#xD;
brought him abreast of Zephyr, and they made ready to start.&#xD;
" Christabel! be careful," called out, Belle in a tone of deep&#xD;
anxiety. ."You will be thrown ! Gracious Heaven, she can't be&#xD;
so wild as to attempt such an outlandish performance, queer as&#xD;
she is. Do speak to her, Mr. Groenveldt."&#xD;
" I do not see occasion," answered Otho coldly ; his lips were&#xD;
compressed and his eyes full of anxiety in spite of his indifferent&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
" Hold on ! old fellow," screamed Jan, " we will leap that little&#xD;
barrier, leave it alone."&#xD;
Thomas stopped astonished at this address, and the rollicking&#xD;
tone of it, and when he saw that it was Chris and Zephyr, and&#xD;
that the rider looked determined and fearless, her eyes fixed&#xD;
on the gate, and flashing like stars, and her head proudly curbed,&#xD;
and Zephyr's red nostrils were dilated, and his eagle glance clear&#xD;
ahd steady, he smiled .confidently upon them, and called out as&#xD;
they flew past:&#xD;
" Wrists level with the elbows, shoulders square, that's right,&#xD;
over you go, whoop and away."&#xD;
Splendidly the beautiful animal rose to the, leap, and he and&#xD;
his light rider went over like a breeze.&#xD;
"Sure and handsome, both of them," said old Thomas, rubbing&#xD;
his hands, " sure and handsome."  Jan followed with a shout and&#xD;
hallo, as if he had been leading the hunt.&#xD;

"I don't mind being beaten by you, Miss Goldsmith. I never&#xD;
saw a lady manage her horse so well,", he tossed off his cap and&#xD;
whirled it around his head, as he trotted back and forth admiring&#xD;
her, a little boldly perhaps, but that Chris had brought on herself,&#xD;
and was too pre-occupied to notice. "I should like to try that&#xD;
once more, with Juniper under me, Miss Goldsmith. This fellow&#xD;
is only a colt, and half trained at best. I should not let you beat&#xD;
me again, though I'd bet on you against the field."&#xD;
Chris felt that she had no right to answer this speech, as it&#xD;
deserved, and she silently reined in Zephyr, and they walked&#xD;
slowly up the avenue..&#xD;
The rest of the party came up in twos and threes, through the&#xD;
open. gate; chatting and laughing and wondering.&#xD;
"She's a precious fairy, sir," said old Thomas to-Otho, "a win-&#xD;
some, lovely, little lady, and she sits Zephyr- like a bird, and he&#xD;
knows it"&#xD;
Otho leaned over his saddle bow, and said something in a low&#xD;
tone, which even Belle could not catch, and Thomas glancing up at&#xD;
him in surprise, touched his cap and walked off towards the stablest&#xD;
and proud Otho looked prouder than ever, and though Belle stud-&#xD;
ied his face, she could make nothing of it. The girls all gathered&#xD;
around Chris upon the long piazza, and congratulated her upon&#xD;
her achievement.&#xD;
"Who taught you to ride ?" asked Zoe. "I declare you make&#xD;
me dizzy, you come out in so many new unexpected ways; but&#xD;
after the postillion I ought not to be startled by anything. Say,&#xD;
you queer girl, who taught you riding and leaping. Is it inspira-&#xD;
tion or education ? and you are up in boxing and boating and&#xD;
archery as well I suppose."&#xD;
"You must question Thomas, he knows all my accomplish-&#xD;
ments, but there's one, which Miss Brandon' excels in, which I&#xD;
have not acquired yet. She's adept beyond anything you and I&#xD;
ever dreamed of, in shooting with the long bow." Chris passed&#xD;
on to the great entrance before' Belle could collect her wits for a&#xD;
retort, brushing Otho with her trailing garments, but not giving&#xD;
&#xD;
him a look, and bowed carelessly to Madame Groenveldt, who&#xD;
stood there ready to receive, as hostess.&#xD;
She had seen the race, and the leap, and disapproved, and took&#xD;
care to make it apparent that she did, and she fixed her eyes sig-&#xD;
nificantly upon Chris' disheveled locks, hanging about her ears in&#xD;
hopeless disorder. But the young girl threw back her look with&#xD;
wilful daring, and pulling off her hat, she took up her stray tresses&#xD;
in her gloved hands, showing them with a laugh to Sam Slaugh-.&#xD;
ton and Mr. Hauxhurst, who paid her many compliments upon&#xD;
her exploit.&#xD;
"L ook," said she, "so much for wild riding, and friendly fin-&#xD;
gers," bowing pointedly to Belle. Their eyes followed her's, and&#xD;
though they did not understand the hit, they laughed at the deep&#xD;
curtsey which Belle returned with bland politeness.  So our&#xD;
naughty Chris was not so much wilted as she ought to have lieen&#xD;
by madame's cold reception. On the contrary, she was to-day what&#xD;
she rarely appeared to the many, brilliant, gay, careless, captivat-&#xD;
ing ; her eyes glittered with strange light, and her little teeth&#xD;
gleamed like pearls, between her scarlet lips, parted in careless&#xD;
laughter. Chandos listened in astonished admiration to her rip-&#xD;
pling merriment, and constant stream of talk to everybody. 'He&#xD;
gazed at her, rubbing his hands in glee.&#xD;
"I say, Otho, she's glorious to-day. There is'nt one here can&#xD;
hold a candle to her. She is doing me credit.- I've taken the&#xD;
right course you see. I've encouraged and brought her out, and&#xD;
she shines, by Jove. Look at her!, What a carriage ! Straight&#xD;
as an arrow. What a head ! Proud as Lucifer. Looks like me,&#xD;
does'nt she? astonishing .likeness, is'nt it?  Speak up 'man," find-&#xD;
ing that Otho made no answer.&#xD;
" Miss Goldsmith  seems in spirits to-day, I think, to judge by&#xD;
her manner," he answered without 'any smiles, and he turned away&#xD;
to address his mother.&#xD;
Chandos, greatly disgusted at his want of enthusiasm, joined&#xD;
the girls who clustered about aa beautiful Pomeranian, who was&#xD;
frolicing and frisking and dashing over the lawn as if vain of his&#xD;
snowy robe.&#xD;

" I wish I was a dog," said Chandy, twirling his thumbs, and&#xD;
sighingike a bellows.°&#xD;
"Oh don't despair, Chandy," spoke up Zoe, pulling her hand.&#xD;
kerchief out of Poin's mouth. "It is p as well to be a puppy.&#xD;
You'll grow."&#xD;
All the girls laughed, and Chandos counted on his fingers.&#xD;
" One, two, three more, Miss Walsingham, there's a dreadful&#xD;
account pilingup for you, better make your peace in time," and&#xD;
he finished looking on the ground in admiring soliloquy. "True&#xD;
she was brown, but naught the brown her beauty marred."&#xD;
Zoe made a dash at his ears, which he warded off in preten-&#xD;
ded terror.&#xD;
"Let her not hurt me! I was ne'er curst,&#xD;
I have no gift at all in shrewishness,&#xD;
Oh, when she is angry, she is keen and shrewd,&#xD;
She was a vixen when she went to school,&#xD;
And though she be but little, she is fierce."&#xD;
" You've your change for several there, I think, Zoe," said Sa-&#xD;
brina, laughing.  "You had better clear off scores and start&#xD;
again."-&#xD;
"Please drop the topic, friends," said Zoe, " Chandy by him-&#xD;
self, I can match well enough, but when he brings in his friend&#xD;
Bill Shakes, I retire."&#xD;
" Ale, gentlemen 1" asked Thomas, hospitaly, bringing along a&#xD;
great -pitcher full.&#xD;
" Not any for me," said Chandos. "I never could abide malt&#xD;
liquor, since I found out that they soak their old gunny bags in&#xD;
it."&#xD;
" Gunny bags !" exclaimed Zoe interrogatively.&#xD;
" I'll bet a hat you are in deep water now, Miss Walsingham,"&#xD;
said Chandy. " But I'm kind. I'll enlighten your ignorance ;&#xD;
they are long bags that the soldiers carry their guns in, and they&#xD;
call them guneys, for. pet, just as Peter calls you Zoey."&#xD;
"He never does call me Zoey," pouted she.&#xD;
"For shame, Chandos !" said Chris.  " I think that is not&#xD;
polite."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Coine dictionary, you shall tell us all about it," insinuated&#xD;
Belle, crossing her hands over Chris arm. "You are such a con-&#xD;
venience to have about; excuse the slang."&#xD;
"Chris shook her off," and shut her lips, vouchsafing no reply.&#xD;
" Don't mind them, dear," said Dulcet in a low voice. "Erudite&#xD;
people are subject to such attacks. I often suffer from them my-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
" Oh, how nice."  Belle clapped her hands, "there's one thing&#xD;
that dictionary don't know."&#xD;
Chris was childish enough to be piqued into airing her knowl-&#xD;
edge.&#xD;
"A plant grows on the Coramandel coast, called. Goni, and&#xD;
gunny is a corruption of the name. Everybody in India almost,&#xD;
spins or weaves it into ropes and bags, mats, carpets, paper, etc.,&#xD;
and it is a source of immense profit. The old bags in which sugar&#xD;
is brought over, are sold' to the beer makers, who boil them to&#xD;
sweeten their liquor, and they sell the bags afterwards, nothing&#xD;
the worse for the cleansing."&#xD;
" Oh what a girl you are, Chris," said Zoe, impulsively. "You&#xD;
shame us all."&#xD;
" We must take her about with us, everywhere."  Belle was&#xD;
dreadfully spiteful, to think she had afforded her an opportunity&#xD;
to shine, " where  did you learn all that funny stuff."&#xD;
"Just where you might, if you had head enough," replied Chris&#xD;
shortly, " in the newspapers."&#xD;
"Dis way young ladies, follow me if you please," said Tonny,&#xD;
making a cartwheel of himself on the gravel walk. " I am sent&#xD;
to distort you to your departments."&#xD;
"You must walk then, Tonny," said Sabrina, "we can't follow&#xD;
in that pace." -Whereupon Tonny did the elephant-walking on&#xD;
his feet and the palms of his hands, keeping his knee joints as&#xD;
stiff as iron.&#xD;
The cool lofty chambers looked airy and inviting, and the girls&#xD;
flew about with their habits tucked up, and chattered and cooed,&#xD;
and threw away a wealth of pretty looks, which would have been&#xD;

capital enough to trade on for -a wholeseason at Newport, and&#xD;
they bathed their faces and settled their toilets.&#xD;
" Chris, thou steeple chaser, let -me fix your hair for you," said,&#xD;
Zoe, when she was all ready to go down, dancing mazourka up to&#xD;
her friend in the deep window,, where she stood apart, gazing,&#xD;
down the long avenue, which she had last seen bare, and tossed&#xD;
in the March wind, now gay with whispering leaves and bathed&#xD;
in warm sunshine.&#xD;
" No, thank you," she replied, coming out of her memories and&#xD;
glancing at Belle Brandon, " I've had plenty of assistance to-day,&#xD;
already. After you have all beautified, and left the mirror&#xD;
to solitude, and to me, I will soon do the needful for my-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
" Be sure that you don't metamorphose yourself, dear, so that&#xD;
we won't know you again. We are already as much astonished&#xD;
as is good for us," said Sabrina, pleasantly kissing her, which&#xD;
parting Zoe intensified into an embrace, by throwing both arms;&#xD;
around her.&#xD;
" Come girls, don't maunder," said Belle impatiently. "It is&#xD;
not worth while to stop up here all day."&#xD;
" Room for the skillful archer," said Chris, bowing to. the&#xD;
blonde -as she sailed away.&#xD;
Left alone, she 'stood a moment gazing at her face in the mir-,&#xD;
ror, and her eye caught the reflection there of a vase of pansies,&#xD;
and half hidden among their leaves a slip of paper, on which was&#xD;
written:&#xD;
"These are for thoughts,&#xD;
Pray you, love, remember."&#xD;
She started and blur'     drew her breath pantingly. They&#xD;
were intended for her,    4the -few words were quite alone,&#xD;
nameless, she knew it as well as if she had seen the shapely&#xD;
fingers arrange them and place them there. She took out slowly&#xD;
all the long hair-pins, and shook the mass down about her shoul-&#xD;
ders in wavy, satiny luxuriance, below her slender waist. Then&#xD;
she commenced with trembling fingers to twine the heavy curls,&#xD;
&#xD;
gazing at herself, and-going back to the sad. days of her great&#xD;
bereavement, and then over her late life so full and rich. She&#xD;
stood then, with the pansies in her hand, absorbed in thought,&#xD;
till she heard Chandy calling her to come down directly. She&#xD;
dropped the ;flowers with a start,, then took them up again, and&#xD;
ended by placing them hastily among her curls, and ran dowi ,&#xD;
half ashamed of her irresolution and conflicting feelings. They&#xD;
were making up sets for dancing, amid much mirth at their tuck-&#xD;
ed-up garments, which some of the girls had fastened at the sides&#xD;
with pins, like the old Anne Boylen pictures, and others had ar-&#xD;
ranged elaborately in festoons, thus displaying their well-laced&#xD;
bottines, and Chris stood a few moments in the door-way, before&#xD;
any one seemed to notice her.&#xD;
"Can you play for dancing, Miss Williams ?" said Chandos.&#xD;
"I'm afraid not, sir," said she, diffidently. "My teacher keeps&#xD;
me so all the while on the chronic scales and archipeligoes, that I&#xD;
forget all my pieces."&#xD;
" Chronic squeals, you mean, don't you, dear," said Belle, ma-&#xD;
king an odd grimace aside to Chandos.&#xD;
"I said scales, I believe," replied poor Mary Ann, a faint color&#xD;
dyeing her chalky cheeks. "I wish you wouldn't poke fun at me ;&#xD;
I'm sure I never do at you."&#xD;
"Don't you, dear? how very magnanimous of you. I assure&#xD;
you, seriously, I have long been of opinion that your squeals are&#xD;
getting chronic. There, don't try to get up a scene ! your lip is not&#xD;
the sort to pout; that kind of thing, to be effective, needs beauty."&#xD;
The merciless girl flew away with a teazing toss of her blonde&#xD;
curls, and a mocking laugh intended to extinguish the foil, who&#xD;
looked so put down, that even Chandos was ashamed to have&#xD;
laughed,.and he took her over to Bertha, who comprehended her&#xD;
role at once, and received her as a precious deposit, and helped&#xD;
her to forget her snubbing.&#xD;
"Let us look at these new books," said she. "These illustrated&#xD;
copies are so amusing."&#xD;
Mary Ann took up one and sat down in a corner. Bertha was&#xD;
called off, and Mary Ann sat still turning over the pages.&#xD;

"What are you reading, Miss Mary ?" asked Mr. Hauxhurst,&#xD;
who did not dance.&#xD;
(Mary Ann, consulting the title-page of her volume,)&#xD;
"It is-Pi-que, a tale of the English Aristookery."&#xD;
Mr. Hauxhurst stifled a kind of cough in his handkerchief; but&#xD;
he had come as escort to Mary Ann, and was too trustworthy and&#xD;
responsible to decline the duties of the office ; and it was a curi-&#xD;
ous study to 'him how it could possibly be that, a human, mind&#xD;
should originate such a number of platitudes as she .poured forth&#xD;
in the half-hour of their conversation. Poor Mary Ann ! kind-&#xD;
hearted girl she was, too, but so kept under, and quenched, and&#xD;
snubbed. He had a curiosity to find out what idea the title of&#xD;
the book she held conveyed to her mind.&#xD;
" What is it about ?" asked he.&#xD;
" Lords and ladies, and those sort of people ; but I don't believe&#xD;
I got the name right, after all; it is Pe-cay, the new kind of&#xD;
cambric for dress, you know.. I suppose Mildred had some made&#xD;
up out of it: maybe it tells how they were fixed ; I mean to read&#xD;
it and see."&#xD;
"Pursuing knowledge under difficulties," said Mr. Hauxhurst.&#xD;
Chris in her floating curls and velvet violets was so different&#xD;
to the work-a-day Chris, that Otho quite forgot -the place,.and&#xD;
lost the voices around him in looking at her; and he started when&#xD;
Chandos tapped him on the shoulder, saying:&#xD;
"You and Chris are detailed to fill up this set, old fellow."&#xD;
Ne stood quite still, without offering to approach her, till she&#xD;
turned her eyes upon him, wondering how he would answer. His&#xD;
face was still and grave, and she fancied he was thinking about&#xD;
his flowers, as perhaps he was, and as she interpreted his thoughts&#xD;
through a medium of her own, she wheeled around so as to give&#xD;
him a very decided cold shoulder.&#xD;
"I am unworthy to wear them; I should not have gotten them&#xD;
if he had known me as he knows me now. I am no longer his&#xD;
.friend ; I foolishly boasted to him that - I would be sufficient to-&#xD;
myself; he sees my inconsistency, and justly despises me."&#xD;

&#xD;
Thinking thus) when he did walk up to her in his usual quick,&#xD;
sedate fashion, saying:&#xD;
"Will you choose to dance with me, Miss Goldsmith ?" she&#xD;
could hardly keep from crying, and answered, hotly:&#xD;
" Chandos+ knows, or ought to know, that I- never saw a quad-&#xD;
rille in my life." . And with a rebellious shake ,of the shoulders,&#xD;
she dropped her eyes, and looked as stormy as Kathrina.&#xD;
He returned her'no answer, and something-moved her to glance&#xD;
up at him. To her astonishment, she discovered the flicker of' a&#xD;
faint smile playing about his face, which only increased her anger.&#xD;
She pulled the flowers from her hair, and tossed them toward&#xD;
him,&#xD;
"I have too many thoughts already; I don't care for-those,"&#xD;
said she, as she passed out of the door, and down upon the lawn.&#xD;
Otho;glanded after her in secret amusement, and quietly pick-&#xD;
ing up the rejected blossoms, he-coolly put them in his vest.&#xD;
Out of sight of the drawing-room window, Chris quickened&#xD;
her steps, and ran down the gravel walk to the stables, and stood&#xD;
awhile gazing at Zephyr in his loose box, who turned his glossy&#xD;
head with a whinneying welcome.    She went up fearlessly,&#xD;
and laid her hot face against him, and with her arm over his neck,&#xD;
she thought how much better and truer .friends dumb animals&#xD;
were than talking humans. Pretty soon she heard voices coming&#xD;
in her direction, but it was only Miss Dulcet leaning upon the&#xD;
Captain. They had been making a -tour of the.farm-yards, and&#xD;
Miss Dulcet seemed to be elaborately explaining.&#xD;
"There's' another curious -animal of the porcine tribe, called&#xD;
the Tapir, a native of South America, which has a horn in its&#xD;
snout. They lived long' time ago, too, because specimens have&#xD;
been found of their remains as deep ,s forty feet below the sur-&#xD;
face. A friend of mine, a great naturalist, discovered in the au-&#xD;
rferous gravel the posterior epiphysis of a curvicaudate vertebra&#xD;
of; a hoofed animal, undoubtedly the Tapir."&#xD;
"I say, Dick,",said Pauline, who had been following the pair&#xD;
about, and listening to their talk,-"let's you and me go to Thomas&#xD;

and make him 'give s sa 'box of 'thoe taters, 'and 'we'll light p&#xD;
the grotto, and play we are elfs."&#xD;
" Taters!" said Dick, 'derisively. "You can't get any light&#xD;
out of taters."&#xD;
" Can't we, though ? as if 'mama don't burn one every night in&#xD;
her room'; and didn'tWe have a 'hundred and fifty on-'our Christ.&#xD;
mas tree."&#xD;
"'Oh what silly things girls 'are, to call candles taters,":said&#xD;
Dick,'hugging himself.&#xD;
"You mean taper," whispered a voice in Pauline's ear. "Don't&#xD;
let him flout you; keep him in order."&#xD;
The sharp child did not turn her head; but she saw her mis.&#xD;
fake, and took the hint instantly.&#xD;
"Look-a-here, you Dick ! You listed and I'll spell it for you:&#xD;
T-a-p-u-r. There, now whit do you think? 'they're red, and blue,&#xD;
and every color."-&#xD;
Dick gave up his teazing, and not being clear-as.to the orthog-&#xD;
raphy, declined to press the 'point, and the two went off arm-in-&#xD;
arm together.&#xD;
Miss Dulcet and the Captain had already walked away, 'prsu-&#xD;
ing their investigations of the porcine genus ; and' Chris and&#xD;
Zephyr were left: to themselves. Shepatted him,,and fed hit all&#xD;
the candy Jan had given her. (He was always buying ;goodies,&#xD;
and had brought'a great package to Brookside, to while the Wait.&#xD;
ing;) and then he stuck his nose into 'her hand insinuatingly, beg.&#xD;
ging for more.&#xD;
"All gone, Zephyr; I'll give you a kiss, though. You'd never&#xD;
have gotten those 'if my mother hadn't given me ip-cac;-sugar to&#xD;
make me hate sweets ; she saved much sugar by hei- plan, and you&#xD;
get Jan's-candy. Dear old fellow, 'how did you know it was&#xD;
nice?"'&#xD;
Somnehow she began to tWist restlessly, as if she were ob-&#xD;
served, and looked out in time to catch a 'glimpse of a dark&#xD;
figure among the hay-ricks, 'and Mr. Otho watched the swallows&#xD;
Ainder the 'eaves, pondering w'hat he had seen.&#xD;
Miss Belle meantime had seated herself in the chair-swing,&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW 'GOLO5EtrHS I%.UGHlTENf.&#xD;
WTd Jan Vedder felt }honored in being permitted 'to sena her Ying&#xD;
through the air; and was satisfied with the smiless and song=&#xD;
snatches he got from her, as she came fluttering 'past him.&#xD;
" Jan is a handsome chap, and he's putting his muselds to -good&#xD;
use, just-now," remarked Chandy, who delighted not in such er-&#xD;
ercise.&#xD;
Thy shifting of the various actors had left him, Sam 'and Haux-&#xD;
hurst together for .a few moments, and 'they were presently joined&#xD;
by the Captain, who had been dismissed 'by Dulcet, 'to the end&#xD;
that she might renew her complexion with neen fn, Which she&#xD;
generally did 'once in about fifteen 'minutes, at all festive gath-&#xD;

" What does he propose doing in Millville ?" asked Hauxhirst,&#xD;
who had small 'opinion of lazy people.&#xD;
"1 expect not much 'except to *hunt and fish ; he's more money&#xD;
than he can use, anyhow. You see his mother petted and spoiled&#xD;
him; she's a delicate pretty little creature, and 'as soft-hearted as&#xD;
anything."&#xD;
"He's got grit in him, I know," said the Captain. "'That&#xD;

crop of wild oats a'ready. But law, Chandos, he ain't so much&#xD;
to blame, after all. You see a woman that has got a boy to fetch&#xD;
up is like an old hen that has been sot on duck's eggs ; she has a&#xD;
good enough time as long as they :stay in the nest, but just the&#xD;
minute they get out, and put for the pond, and begin to swim off;&#xD;
she's all fuss and feathers. The young varmints don't 'mind 'her&#xD;

know all about it, for I've been there, and I expect I ke1 gy moth-&#xD;

S"Well, anice hen brought me up, and I hope I haven't beena&#xD;
cross to her.- My swimming has been satisfactory so far," said&#xD;
Sam.&#xD;
"So was I," said Hauxhurst,." and I 'flatter myself she abVer&#xD;

"And;I," added Chandy. "Why boys, what ,a *precious lot of&#xD;
ducks we are, to be 'sure."&#xD;
"I'll tell you a true- story about a hen, if you will promise to&#xD;

eggs,, and she brought them all off successfully.; and though she&#xD;
nearly went into spasms when they took -'to the water, she' got&#xD;
used to it after a little, and would wait about peaceably for them&#xD;
to have their swim, and hover and cuddle them as motherly as&#xD;
could be. The next time she wanted to set, I put her on to hen's&#xD;
eggs, and when they hatched, down she started towards the pond;&#xD;
and she tried her level best to make the chicks go in; and when&#xD;
she found they wouldn't paddle, she. just picked them up one by&#xD;
one,. and plumped them into the water, and the consequence was&#xD;
she had a lot of. dead chickens in about fifteen minutes."&#xD;
"I say, John Haux, you don't expect us to swallow that."&#xD;
"I assure you it is true, Goldsmith. It occurred under my&#xD;
own eye, on my own place. . If you will come home with me some&#xD;
time I'll-show you the pond, and introduce you to my mother hen&#xD;
and the rest of her brood, who I flatter myself are as creditable&#xD;
offspring as you'll find in any farm-house."&#xD;
We'll make up a party," said Chandy. "You may count on'&#xD;
a benefit."&#xD;
Chris having bid good-bye to Zephyr, had sauntered slowly toward&#xD;
the kitchen, where Deborah, a great raw-boned, powerful woman,&#xD;
stood at a table dressing the birds for supper. Coarse-featured&#xD;
and large-handed, as she said of herself, " cut out for a regular&#xD;
steamboat," it was surprising what a beautiful light broke over&#xD;
her face as Chris entered ; it was a real welcome, and she took it&#xD;
thankfully into her heart. She sat down by the window, and&#xD;
looking out at the. bright-colored fowls glancing and shining in&#xD;
the sunshine, she said in a pitiful voice:&#xD;
"I've come to stay with you, Deborah; you love me, don't&#xD;
you ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.       381&#xD;
&#xD;
"Indeed and indeed, but I do, little Chrissy; no, you are not&#xD;
little Chrissy now, but I can't seem to,take in your bigness. Do&#xD;
you remember my ducklings you put to sleep down by the pond,&#xD;
and brought me to see them. 'Ltook, Deb,' says you, 'how pretty&#xD;
they lie, all their little swimmers tucked up under them.' Ha !&#xD;
ha! you said so, Miss Chrissy, and my poor ducklings all as dead&#xD;
as door-nails; and'the old black sow that came so near being the&#xD;
death of you, such a wicked, savage beast as she was when- she&#xD;
had young ones, and so hard to fat up at last. .I shall'never for-&#xD;
get how you looked that day, when my Bessie came flying to me,&#xD;
so scared, and when I got there I was- fit to drop. . You'd got&#xD;
your curly head drawn back over your shoulders, and your two&#xD;
fat arms up, and your great eyes fastened on her, and she with&#xD;
her fore-paws in your lap, champing and grunting. My blessed&#xD;
people, hew Thomas did run, when he got sight of her.! He&#xD;
dropped the milk pails, brimming full, and came like lightning,&#xD;
and all her little pigs racing and squealing with their tails over&#xD;
their backs, for a bit of you.&#xD;
She looked into Chris' troubled face, almost as if these remin-&#xD;
iscences were prolonged with a purpose.&#xD;
"You did'nt come up to the old place for a long while, and you&#xD;
are a good deal changed since those times. I would'nt have be-&#xD;
lieved you could have grown so. When you came up with Mr.&#xD;
Otho last March I could'nt get over beingsurprisedof you. You&#xD;
like Mr. Otho, Miss Chrissy ; he's a fine quiet gentleman, is'nt he ?&#xD;
he loves to hear about those times. He comes to me of a morn-&#xD;
ing with a book in his fist, and sits there by that window, just&#xD;
where you are now, (Chris got up and moved to the side by the&#xD;
door,) and he says to me, and I busy with the pastry:and things,&#xD;
'Mr. Goldsmith was a great -fisherman, was'nt he ?' or, ' Miss&#xD;
Chris used to come often to Craigenfells, Deborah ;' and then I&#xD;
tell all, how you used to climb and jump and frolic, and how still&#xD;
and pretty you would sit by your papa, and he .a reading to you&#xD;
and twisting your curls. Oh yes, he's a very nice gentleman, and&#xD;
its. quite a pleasure to have him here. You ought to go.back&#xD;

amongst the youngfolks now, dear," she continued, looking wist-&#xD;
fully-nto the troubled young face, "they wills miss you."&#xD;
"Oh no, indeed," said Chris. curling her lip, "no one will miss&#xD;
me;. I'm better here with. you than: anywhere else. I wish I&#xD;
could come and live with you, Deb, and be petted and cuddled."-&#xD;
"Poor child! and you.,so young. and so pretty! well, that beats&#xD;
all! Here:comes the young ladies! I told you they would be&#xD;
huntingyou out."y&#xD;
"I don't want, to -see any of them; don't let them in!"&#xD;
Chris slid .through the wash-house door and ran around- in&#xD;
through the :entrance to the conservatory, and hid behind an or-&#xD;
ange tree. She felt too stormy to show her face just yet, but&#xD;
that scamp. of a Pom had seen her run, and set off in chase, and&#xD;
he seized-her dress and barked and made dashes at her, which all&#xD;
her attempts could not quiet."&#xD;
"-Here she is," said Zoe; "caught and caged, but notstarved&#xD;
to death. Leave go, you young villain, she's none of your game.&#xD;
Come out on the lawn, Chris, I want you."  She held up a bunch&#xD;
of ox-eyed daisies close-clasped in her little fist. "You are to&#xD;
have your fortune told. We've all had ours. Sabrina is doomed&#xD;
to wither on the parent-tree. Belle Brandon has a thief in re-&#xD;
serve for her,. and" nobody is suited but me. I've a fierce Indian&#xD;
chiefswith a couple ,of tomahawks, and a row of scalps, and I'm&#xD;
to live:in a wigwam like Laughing-water, and make moccasins."&#xD;
While she ran on, she had: been drawing - Chris after her, and&#xD;
she stopped-before Peter, saying--&#xD;
" I'm done for, Peter.- I'm away to the great hunting grounds.&#xD;
I hope you will come and see.-me, and, I'll let you ride my pet&#xD;
buffalo, and grind you some parched corn and treat you to-half-&#xD;
a-dozen scalps and, a wampum belt, if- my savage warrior will&#xD;
permit me. Chris. is about to tempt fate now; stand aside, all of&#xD;
you, while I place her within the magic ring."  She pushed- her&#xD;
up to the wide-spreading elm, beneath whose shade Otho sat&#xD;
calmly-,smoking in the great laurel-root chair and thrust a daisy&#xD;
into -her.hand.&#xD;
" That is the king of the sorcerers sitting there," she explained,&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.        -     383&#xD;
in a stage whisper. "ie could tell your fate by looking into that&#xD;
fiery ruby on his finger ; but since Solomon put down the diviners&#xD;
and soothsayers, he is afraid of being taken up by the police and&#xD;
"lodged in the calaboose ; so we won't speak to him. Begin now."&#xD;
"But I don't know the lingo ; such nonsense !"&#xD;
" Of course it is arrant nonsense ; don't' ask-Miss Goldsmith to&#xD;
try to be amused with our follies. Such great. minds can't be&#xD;
expected to be pleased with a rattle and tickled with a straw."&#xD;
Chris seized the daisy immediately. "Tell me," demanded&#xD;
she, turning her back upon Belle, who had placed herself behind&#xD;
Otho's chair, " what is it I am to say."&#xD;
" Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief, lawyer, doctor, In-&#xD;
dian chief. I know before-hand how it will end."&#xD;
"-How?" asked Sabrina.&#xD;
"Why doctor, of course. I see the seedy individual at. this&#xD;
very moment, jerking along in his rusty old sulkey, his saddle-&#xD;
bags before him, and wafting about his responsible person odors&#xD;
not by any means of Araby the blest."&#xD;
"I don't fancy the picture, and don't think I shall tempt, for-&#xD;
tune if she has nothing better to offer me."&#xD;
"Biut you shall, though. You have done some tremendous&#xD;
things to please yourself to-day, and now you shall please us."&#xD;
"The French maidens have a much prettier way -of 'telling&#xD;
their destiny," remarked-Belle Brandon. " Did you ever hear it,&#xD;
Chris ?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered Chris shortly, " I have."&#xD;
" Please explain it then," said Belle, eyeing her incredulously.&#xD;
Chris deigned- no reply, and was about to' retire altogether,&#xD;
when Zoe caught her hand. " I' know what it is, and we ,wil&#xD;
have it, only I can't speak French, whatever the rest can do."&#xD;
" Dear learned Chris can speak it, I am sure," said Belle, with&#xD;
a wicked glitter in her eyes.&#xD;
" Can you?"- asked Zoe.&#xD;
" I suppose I might," she replied indifferently. "But I don't&#xD;
feel in the humor to-day."&#xD;

"Humors are, so convenient. sometimes," said Belle. "They&#xD;
serve to shelter all sorts of short-comings."&#xD;
Otho seemed not to be listening. He had risen and stood lean-&#xD;
ing against the tree-trunk, getting a view of the lake through his&#xD;
tubed hand.&#xD;
" Come, fire away, Chris !" called out Chandos impatiently.&#xD;
"You can stumble through some how, I dare say, and I'm going to&#xD;
tempt.dame Fortune myself when the feminines are disposed of."&#xD;
"Ihad rather not, Chandos, if you please ; I don't care about&#xD;
making afool of myself."&#xD;
"Speak to her, Mr. Groenveldt,.she always, obeys you," said&#xD;
Belle.&#xD;
"I think Miss Goldsmith is right. It is folly, and folly afoot&#xD;
does not suit such a grave, dignified young lady ; she needs&#xD;
Zephyr as a coadjutor."&#xD;
Belle looked perfectly radiant, and the others glanced uneasily&#xD;
at Chris, whose face was pale and quiet.&#xD;
" Give me a fresh daisy, Zoe," said she quickly; "I'm going.&#xD;
to try for a wigwam next to yours. I'm sick of civilized people."&#xD;
Fluently and smoothly, without the least effort or hesitation, or&#xD;
as Chandy told her afterwards, like "a demned native," she pro-&#xD;
nounced, the phrases, as she plucked the petals-" i m' aine un&#xD;
peu, beaucoup, passionnement, pas de tout."  She came to the.last&#xD;
ray, and it ended, with "passionnement."  She stood with the&#xD;
denuded receptacle in her fingers and colored painfully, amid the&#xD;
chorus of laughers around her, and Zoe presented her another&#xD;
blossom, saying-&#xD;
"Very' well so far. You've got the lover all safe, now then for&#xD;
the wigwam. I've set my heart upon having you for a neighbor."&#xD;
Without an instant's hesitation she went through the formula,&#xD;
ending as Zoe had foretold with doctor,  Not daring to glance at&#xD;
Otho, in the clapping of' hands and shouting which ensued, she&#xD;
stood twirling the little. yellow button, and studying it in the&#xD;
deepest embarrassment. When .she' did look up he was gone.&#xD;
He had walked to the house, and was already running his&#xD;
fingers over the piano keys in the great drawing-room.&#xD;
&#xD;
Belle Brandon gazed fixedly at her in the Geraldine manner.&#xD;
At fault once more. What sort of a creature was this. She had&#xD;
jocosely named her the wooden image on the hill that night, and&#xD;
had used the epithet since when it was safe. She felt the most&#xD;
intense desire to bring her into ridicule, and rejoiced over her&#xD;
quarrel with Otho. What was only a passing idea at 'first,:from&#xD;
a habit- she had of so amusing herself with her acquaintances, and&#xD;
looking upon this absent-minded, ill dress.ed girl as fair game,-had&#xD;
gotten from one cause and another to be, a fixed purpose. While&#xD;
she was, thinking and gazing, Chandos came up with a daisy in&#xD;
his hand.&#xD;
" Now is the appointed time, I think, Miss Brandon ; please&#xD;
put me out of my misery at 'once. Do I love you or do' I not?&#xD;
in pity decide the momentous question for me, and my tortured&#xD;
heart shall either heal itself in your smiles or fly from their pres-&#xD;
ence forever."  He presented a famous ox-eye, with a killing&#xD;
bow and his hand on his vest pocket. Belle took it with.a pretty&#xD;
smile, and the words came trippingly from her smooth tongue,&#xD;
but looking out for the end, she counted forward, and foresaw that&#xD;
it would come out "pas de tout."  Dexterously and quickly she&#xD;
jerked two at once, hoping she was unobserved, and allowed her&#xD;
voice to fall into melting cadence, and a pretty blush to mount&#xD;
in her.cheek, as she finished softly, "passionnernent."&#xD;
"All right ;- I'm ahappy man, or shall be when my moustache&#xD;
gets a little thicker; and one word in your ear, MissBrandon."&#xD;
Belle bent graciously, and he whispered, with his mouth saucily-&#xD;
near to her cheek-&#xD;
" I think if you should try that dodge on to Jan Vedder, you&#xD;
could bring it out without. any prestidigitating. He's head over&#xD;
ears already, and puch a look as you gave me just now, would&#xD;
finish him off teetotally."'&#xD;
Bello glowered, and jerked ner head away from Master Chandy&#xD;
and his impudence, who walked off with a saicy laugh.&#xD;
Bertha Groenveldt stood apart from the rest, behind a shelter-&#xD;
ing rose bush, with a daisy in her fingers, from which she was&#xD;

"He loves me," she murn ured, putting the. last petal to her&#xD;
lips. ' Oh, I hope sol.&#xD;
Chandos came up behind her, and waited unperceived for the&#xD;
climax, iptending to laugh with her at the result, whatever it&#xD;
might be, but when, he. saw her emotion, he stole. off, with-&#xD;
out a word; and, going out among the pines, he:%limped;thought-&#xD;
fully up and' 'down, his 'head bent, and his eyes fixed upon. the.&#xD;
whi shells, whistling melhdiously for full five. minutes.. Then&#xD;
he-took his hands'out of his pockets and tossed off his curls, and&#xD;
started for.'the house, by way of the garden. Emerging from the&#xD;
hedge, he. cameupon Pauline Bradshaw, seated crossleggedi in_&#xD;
Thomias'blue wheelbarrows with her-back to the wheel, her hands&#xD;
folded in her.lap,, coolly observant of, Dick Walsinghamns crimson&#xD;
face, and puffed' Qut cheeks,,who was. officiting as' her°thorough&#xD;
bred: and,:hbad evidently been, at his top, speed; for he was nearly&#xD;
blown, anidrew in his breast like.a puffing porpoise. He stopped&#xD;
in the shafts and. pulled; out his handkerchief; and mopped his hot&#xD;
face&#xD;
"I say Pauline,' #said he, wickedly,, you are only a klad of&#xD;
dirt) after all;"'&#xD;
"«We are all, made of dirt," replied. Pauline composedly.,&#xD;
Biut:some-areruade of coarse red gravel6"&#xD;
'Yes, Injins, and those,"' answered: Pauline still: unmoved4&#xD;
"'lam nade. of that nice kind that they make fine teacups 'out of.&#xD;

'f Ha ! ha!l" roared: Dick. "If you are, made- of silence, Id&#xD;

"Shall I tell you what you are made of?"&#xD;
"I knowyou're going to- say putty, or dough, by your looks,&#xD;
but I don't care, you can't plague me-abit.&#xD;
"o indeed; you are made 'of 'that kindsof clay that theymake&#xD;

Chandy clapped his hands and they both turned around. "I'll&#xD;

&#xD;
help you out a little Pauline," said he,. and chanted through his&#xD;
nose.&#xD;
"'Snaps and snails and puppy dog's tails,:&#xD;
That's what little boys are made of.'&#xD;
"Pauline, when you've got tired of sitting in that old wheel-&#xD;
barrow, I'd get out if I was you," said Dick in a huff; and tossing&#xD;
one his cap and swinging his arms, he walked away, entirely ignor-&#xD;
ing Chandy.&#xD;
"PIm tired now, Dick," said Pauline, rising hurriedly, and pre-&#xD;
paring to follow.&#xD;
" Are you. not angry with Dick,. Miss Pauline.? I think he is&#xD;
not very polite."&#xD;
"No. I think he is splendid. He is'only going, off to get rid of&#xD;
you;  we. don't want him round with us, do we, Dick ?"&#xD;
"I think I may as well hobble off," said Chandy, laughing, " so'&#xD;
cleverly left out of the play. Good-bye, Pauline."&#xD;
He came back. to the party indoors,,.his brow' cleared, and his&#xD;
handsome face lighted up cheerily. They 'were all gathered&#xD;
around the piano, where Otho was preparing to accompany-Miss&#xD;
Brandon in a song. She had selected "Poor Louise," which. if&#xD;
it is not quite the thing to come out of a: pure' young maiden's&#xD;
mouth, certainly suited Belle's style of execution,, and' showed off&#xD;
her liquids upper. tones. When she had: finished, she. turned to&#xD;
Zoe..&#xD;
"My' aunt would not, let, me sing that song. I think it. is&#xD;
charming, don't you?"&#xD;
" The air is beautiful, and you singit delightfully," said. Bertha,&#xD;
coming to. Zoe's-help, who was trying. to find,,something.,to 'say&#xD;
which should be:true,. and- not sound rude. Otho: laid, the sheet&#xD;
aside, with a little curl of his short upper lip, and began. Buck's&#xD;
",Sleigh: bells,", that charming. composition which- has. in it a&#xD;
whole poem of winter pleasures. Miss Brandon studied him till'&#xD;
he had finished,, and when the last.chord was struck, she ran up&#xD;
and clasped Chris' ant. gushingly.&#xD;
"Now dear, ,you tshall-sing us. something."&#xD;

Chris startedsand freeing herself as tenderly 'from the grasp&#xD;
as if it had been Geraldine in person, she refused plumply.&#xD;
" But you must, child. You know what happened to the wick-&#xD;
ed fellow who hid his talents in a iiapkin." .-&#xD;
"You may spare your irreverent breath, for I assure you,&#xD;
nothing is farther from my intention than to do anything which&#xD;
could by any chance afford you one instant's gratification:"&#xD;
4"'Oh dear," exclaimed Belle, holding up her hands, "don't be&#xD;
so overwhelming. I'm absolutely quenched."&#xD;
Zoe put her arms around her, and whispered'in her ear. "Can&#xD;
you sing pet ?" said she. Chris nodded. "What a developeryou-&#xD;
are, as rich as cream. You shall be good and sweet to Sabrina&#xD;
and me, and we'll let'you polish off Belle as smooth as you' like."&#xD;
" Miss Goldsmith," said Otho, " this way if you please."&#xD;
Chris approached most unwillingly, but she did not know how&#xD;
to refuse. He pointed to a manuscript so elaborately copied as&#xD;
to be scarcely distinguishable from copper plate, which he laid&#xD;
upon the racli, rolling it first in his hands to make it stand up.&#xD;
"If you please," he bowed as quietly as though about to give&#xD;
a singing lesson.. " Stand a little nearer; Miss Brandon could tell&#xD;
you the exact spot to occupy to suit yourself and your pianist."&#xD;
The hot blood dashed over Chris face in a crimson flood as she&#xD;
glanced at the music.&#xD;
"It is impossible," exclaimed she faintly,' "I cannot do it."&#xD;
" Come Chris, don't bother !" called out Chandy, " my sister is&#xD;
not going to be indulged in anysmall nonsense."'&#xD;
" Mr. Groenveldt," said Chris, speaking very low, "do you&#xD;
really wish me-to sing that ?"&#xD;
"I am not in'the habit of making idle requests."  He went on'&#xD;
withthe prelude; arrived at the bar, he glanced up at her with&#xD;
a business nod, saying, "begin."  Somehow, in spite of herself, of.&#xD;
her anger and bitterness, she had to begin, and she went through&#xD;
in &amp;amp; wrapt hush of eager listening.'&#xD;
Aliost'before the last note had ceased to vibrate, the dear old&#xD;
Professor came and gently placed her hand within his arm, to lead&#xD;
her out to supper. Patting the little palm softly he said:&#xD;
&#xD;
. "Your song smells of the . daisies, and tinkles like running&#xD;
brooks, Fraulein, pleasant and sweet."&#xD;
" You are very kind, sir," answered Chris in a tired voice.  -&#xD;
" Fidde lural, lural le, rump to tidde diddie de," Chandy chan-&#xD;
ted, snapping his fingers, and toeing and heeling to the measure.&#xD;
"What . tricksey, pucksy, dancing, prancing little ditty it is Chris,&#xD;
you've got hold of there. Where did you come across it."&#xD;
"It is really quite pretty," said Belle Brandon. "I was going&#xD;
to learn it at Saratoga, last summer, but I thought it rather tame&#xD;
for my style. Don't you think it is rather tame, Mr. Groenveldt.&#xD;
You are a connoisseur."&#xD;
Otho had already left -the piano, and offered his arm to Mary&#xD;
Ann Williams, and made no reply to the question.&#xD;
"Girls," said Sabrina, who was lingering near the piano, and&#xD;
had the song in her hand, " Look here ! "'Words by Christabel,&#xD;
music by O. G. Craigenfells, March 20th."&#xD;
" Sold! Belle Brandon, sold for a song," shouted Chandy in&#xD;
high glee.&#xD;
" 'Well, it don't matter in the least. Those things are all tid-reii&#xD;
anyhow, as you yourself very elegantly expressed it. If it was&#xD;
not that, it was something else about roses and posies, of the same&#xD;
stamp," replied Belle without a blush, and coolly placing her hand&#xD;
on Chandy's arm, she added:&#xD;
" You asked me to go out to supper with you, I believe, I'm so&#xD;
glad it is ready, for I'm as hungry as a littlesquirrel."&#xD;
No, I don't find any such fact evolved from my inner con-&#xD;
sciousness, but since you make the suggestion, shall I have the&#xD;
honor."&#xD;
Chris was seated at the Professor's right hand, but she -could&#xD;
not enjoy his talk, though she made a great effort to attend, nor&#xD;
could she reply to the polite things which her neighbor, Sam&#xD;
Slaughton, addressed to her. She did laugh once, however, when&#xD;
she glanced over 4t Pauline, who. was fitting each of her rasp-&#xD;
berries on to her fingers like a thimble, and saying, "how-de-do,"&#xD;
as she welcomed them into her mouth, with a grin and flourish ;&#xD;

place ; he looked over and beyond her, and saw none of her sig&#xD;
nals, but was very grand and severe upon an unfortunate waiter&#xD;
who misplaced some of the entrements, and waived him out of the&#xD;
room instantly. He was as absolute at Craigenfells in the absence&#xD;
of:the genial owner, as madame herself at RosenbIoom. ie&#xD;
yielded to the dear old Professor and Otho, from respect and lik-&#xD;
ing, but stubbornly refused to .e commanded by madame, and at-&#xD;
tending perfectly to his duties, he would take his own way in dis-&#xD;

can anticipate all his wants. ,Glancing up and down the table,&#xD;
for something particularly nice, she espied a plate of curled cress&#xD;
before the Professor, who had a weakness for cress.&#xD;
",Captain I" said she, with a most insinuating air, and wining&#xD;
smile, "do try some of the peppergrass. It is a remarkably es-&#xD;
culent vegetable. Thomas, please assist Captain Slocum to the&#xD;
peppergrass."&#xD;
"No thank you, ma'am," replied the.captain, eyeing it askance.&#xD;
I don't seemto hanker after cut feed. This stew about fills the&#xD;
bill, ego-bully; we used to call it in Texas."&#xD;
This wa  ery hard lines to poor prim Miss Dulcet, though she&#xD;
tried.not-to wince, and to look at the Captain as if his rough edges&#xD;
were -fne polished marble. To turn the attention of those near&#xD;
hershe raised her eyeglass at a picture opposite her.&#xD;
:Isnot that an Airy Sheffer ?' said she.&#xD;

"Oh, pretty well, he's cute and sharp enough, but I c n't quite&#xD;

a"Peter, my lad, I heard that you had taken a boy, 'a little&#xD;

day trying to knock the pipe out of the-old lady's mouth, and&#xD;
never hit it once."&#xD;
"Why, Mr. Slaughton," spoke up Sabrina in much surprise,&#xD;
"I should think he would have put you off the place. Pray what&#xD;
sort of a position could his aunt have held in the household to be&#xD;
treated so rudely."&#xD;
" It was monstrous," said Chandy, " but he set us the example,&#xD;
he was shying sticks at the poor dear when wO got there, and in-&#xD;
vited us to join'"&#xD;
"You are making fun of us of course," said Zoe," are'nt they&#xD;

"There is axi English game-ar post set in the ground with a&#xD;

it, that they are trying to mystify you," answered Chris quietly,&#xD;
not in the least joining in the mirth.&#xD;
"I'll go on with my story now," said Chandy, " my riddle is&#xD;

some fine morning he would wake up and find himself the only&#xD;
spoon in the house. You see the point Peter, I suppose ?"&#xD;
" Pretty ood," said'Peter, joining in the laugh against him-&#xD;

" Ever eat any Pompino, Captain," asked Jan Vedder, watch-&#xD;
ing the Captain working away at his trout..&#xD;
" What do you know about Pompino, you young Dutchman ?"&#xD;
"Oh I've caught lots of them," replied Jan, laughing..&#xD;
" Whar ?" asked the Captain curtly.&#xD;
" I paddled around the Gulf all one summer, when I was a&#xD;
boy."&#xD;
"Hook any devil-fish ?" (eyeing the young fellow keenly) ; he&#xD;
thought he was humbugging.&#xD;
" Not many," laughed Jan, "but I saw one do a rare trick; he&#xD;
got caught among the piles of the new wharf, and he ripped them&#xD;
up in 1o time, and set them floating out to sea. I was fool enough&#xD;
to harpoon one, and I lost a good point.for my pains ; he did'not&#xD;
mind it any more than a pin prick. The boys caught one that&#xD;
night which measured twenty-two feet across and not remarkably&#xD;
large either."&#xD;
" They are a nasty critter, but there's one that's uglier down&#xD;
there-that's- the ' Aligator-Gar.' "&#xD;
" That," remarked the Professor to Chris, "is the only fish we&#xD;
have which belonged to-the ante-deluge.period."&#xD;
" Miss Dulcet had a little learning bottled up which she took&#xD;
occasion' to uncork here.  "Apropos' to the Gulf, Professor,,&#xD;
terrestrial incadescence is a wonderful study, is it not. It seems&#xD;
to me that Frauenhofer's spectroscope is destined to take rank with&#xD;
the telescope as a' revealer of secrets. Don't - you think so, sir?"&#xD;
" Miss Dulcet is speaking to you, captain," said Chandy, ma-&#xD;
liciously.&#xD;
Captain Slocum went on pulling fish bones out of the. corner&#xD;
of hismouth.,&#xD;

"I was not addressing you, sir," said Dulcet ready to cry,&#xD;
"don't disturb yourself, pray."&#xD;
" Oh yes you was, Miss Dulcet, there's no use denying it. You&#xD;
was looking right at Captain Slocum," said Belle, enjoying her&#xD;
mortification, and hoping to bring out another retort, from the&#xD;
Captain.' This time it was Sabrina who came to the rescue.&#xD;
" I suppose you all know that Professor Soyez is coming to&#xD;
Millville to give a course of lectures on cooking. He prepares&#xD;
the dishes in the presence of the audience, and permits them to&#xD;
taste the good things. They say his lectures are high art, and&#xD;
Adolphe the cook is a perfect poem. " I move we all go."&#xD;
" I'm going," spoke up Zoe, promptly. She would have said&#xD;
the same if it had been 'the Chinese jugglers or a traveling car-&#xD;

"There's one Bourbon among us, who needs no lessons dans le&#xD;

the delicacies she excels in," said Belld, bowing to Chris.&#xD;
"You iean my sister, I suppose," said Cha-ndy, getting up,&#xD;
.throwing down his napkin with a flourish, pulling down his vest,&#xD;
aid clearing his throat. "Unaccustomed as I am, and tinpre-&#xD;

" Hold on, Chandy," said Sam, "let's finish our dinner first ; you&#xD;
ruin our digestion mixing things so,"&#xD;
"All right, just as you say," replied Chandos, sitting down, and&#xD;
going on with his dinner.&#xD;
"My aunt had a splendid cook, but she was a perfect demon,&#xD;
and kept a small inferno in the kitchen. Good cooks as a rule&#xD;
are always ugly, do you know ?' I think it is a 'curious fact ; I&#xD;
don't know if it is the spices or the heat which spoils. the temper.&#xD;
What do you think, Mr. Groenveldt ?"&#xD;
Otho bowed -politely, and professed himself not sufficiently up&#xD;
in the subject to discuss it ; and Chris seemed so. absorbed in&#xD;
Sam Slaughton, toward whom her head was turned, that Belle&#xD;
felt as if she had lost her shot. She need not, however,"for Mas-&#xD;

"I'm glad you are so fond of cooking, Christabel,". said Dulcet,&#xD;
smiling at the Captain. "'I am an excellent house..wife, myself,&#xD;
and I shall, be delighted to compare impressions and experiences,&#xD;
as wel 1 as to exchange recipes."&#xD;
" I am not only not fond of it," said Chris, bluntly, "but I hate-&#xD;
and despise it, and everything belonging to house-work. It is de-&#xD;
testable drudgery, and an. intolerable burden too heavy to be'&#xD;
borne."&#xD;
Madame could not help turning to Otho, with an "I to'd you&#xD;
so;" triumph on her face, but she said, patronizingly:&#xD;
"I think 1 must undertake to chaperone yoii, my dear child,, to&#xD;
those lectures. I have heard much of them; you may get to&#xD;
like necessary knowledge better after a while-I hope so, at least.&#xD;
No young lady is ready to marry in this country of irresponsible.&#xD;
servants till she can keep a house, and these plain duties must be&#xD;
her pleasures."&#xD;
" I, for one young lady, madame, have no idea-of getting rar-&#xD;
ried; nothing is farther from -my thoughts and desires;, and as&#xD;
for this everlasting cant about duty,rm sick of the sound of it."&#xD;
Madame forgave her the flippancy of her ending in the fervent&#xD;
hope that she might long continue in the same mind as touching&#xD;
marriage; and she began to meditate a lecture upon the peculiar-&#xD;
duties and obligations of old.maidenhood, after the style of those-&#xD;
she. wasaccustomed to deliver from her seat of authority at Ros-&#xD;
enbloom, when she was rather put off the track by an innocent&#xD;
remark of Chandy's.&#xD;
"In brev curiculo, it is not worth while to go into tantos labo-_&#xD;
res, freely translated, great fusses."&#xD;
As he was looking, at her, she wondered what he meant, and&#xD;
she was nearly petrified by an interchange of asides between-&#xD;
Dulcet and the Captain.&#xD;
(Miss.Dulcet, taking up her flower vase,)- Captain,,how would,&#xD;
you like being a nursery-gardener;?"&#xD;
(Captain, expressively smiling,) " Can't say that I hanker after&#xD;
that, but I should admire. to-dote uponra nursery, ma'am."&#xD;

mach that she frowned upon the young Roaring Riverites, and&#xD;
sipped her coffee in silence,&#xD;
The dear old Professor head nnee of it,.for he was watching&#xD;
Chris. Her flashing eyes and unrestful look troubled him, and&#xD;
he searched his thoughts for a pleasant topic.&#xD;
S "I found some lovely Coleoptera,.Frarlein, on the mountain this&#xD;
morning."  He touched her hand as he spoke with a light caress.&#xD;
"I must 'show you."&#xD;
" Do you make collections of those things, sir ?" interrupted&#xD;
Chandy. The Professor noted the merry light.in the youngster's&#xD;
eyes, and rubbed. his hands.enjoyingly.&#xD;
"Ah yes, I am fond of them; but I not do find such many nice&#xD;
ones in dis countrie. They be all too sad-colored;. no sparkle, no&#xD;
foyer."&#xD;
" Why, sir, how odd now ; who to look at you would take you&#xD;
for such an old bug-ger."&#xD;
"Bug-ger ! bug-ger ! Vas is das ?" replied the Professor, rais-&#xD;
ing mystified eye-brows at his son.&#xD;
- A moment's anger possessed Otho, that the irreverent fellow&#xD;
should dare to cut .jokes upon his dear, noble father; but he soon&#xD;
got the better of it, and explained the play upon words of Ohan-&#xD;
dy's audacious nonsense, and. Herr Groenveldt glanced at the fun-&#xD;
lighted eyes which so fearlessly sought his, and replied, chuckling&#xD;
and shaking his finger:&#xD;
"ou von fery pad poy, I tink ; any-wase you make von fery&#xD;

The laugh turned where it belonged, and Chandy's was loudest&#xD;
and heartiest of all.     -&#xD;
Chris was glad when it was all over, the talking and.the laugh-&#xD;
ing, which made her dizzy; and she glanced sometimes at Oih,&#xD;
wondering if he thought of that other supper, so different to this,&#xD;
and which: seemed- so very long ago. Tears rose. in her eyes,&#xD;
everything was so cris-cross, and out of joint; the rich color was&#xD;
fading out of her cheeks, and she looked: weary and, absent, and&#xD;

WIDOW GOLDSMIfHI'S DAUGHTER      37&#xD;
&#xD;
out under the spreading oaks, she followed the devious path&#xD;
around the black pond, glassy and still, and sat down upon a rus-&#xD;
tic bench inzthe square temple of a 'summer-house at its edge,&#xD;
and leaning over the rail and watching the great floating lily-pads&#xD;
and their shadowy doubles in the deep water, she fell to thinking.&#xD;
Our Chris was not one of those dead-and-alive souls, who plod&#xD;
along, bearing life upon their bent shoulders like, a faggot of&#xD;
brushwood, neither did she rush and hurry through the hours,&#xD;
tumbling together events and impressions in a tangled web, like a&#xD;
skein of waste cotton, to be tossed on the shelf and forgotten.&#xD;
She stopped, as we know, sometimes, to think, to resolve what&#xD;
she saw, and heard, and read, and felt, and so lived her life over.&#xD;
and over, gathering rare flowers, where commoner souls found&#xD;
only trailing weeds ; but also suffering keen tortures in memories&#xD;
of words and deeds which they dropped out of their lives without&#xD;
an emotion.&#xD;
Now gazing down at the face looking up at her from the still&#xD;
pool, she went over her day and took herself bitterly to task for&#xD;
her conduct. Rude, hoydenish, quick to take offence, flippant&#xD;
and pert toward Madame, vixenish to her best friend;. a sad&#xD;
record for half-a-dozen hours. True, she had been made to suf-&#xD;
fer, and sobs came- up in her throat and choked her as she remem-&#xD;
bered how the hardest. blows had been dealt, and by whom. A&#xD;
wise man has said, 'no one knows so well how to inflict tortures as&#xD;
those rho have the key to the little side -door of the heart;' and&#xD;
poor Chris, without knowing what she did, had unlocked the por-&#xD;
tal and welcomed grave Otho into the very inner chamber. Now -&#xD;
she tried to arm herself with indignation to drive him forth, but&#xD;
there he sat, ;imperative, exacting; not to be contradicted, but oh,&#xD;
so kind. How could the first slight, thefirst stern look, have&#xD;
made her forget the constant kindness which had enriched her life&#xD;
for so many happy weeks with new and unknown flavor.' The&#xD;
goodness-which had chosen her for a companion front among so&#xD;
many'superior to her in every way;, which had ignored her glar-&#xD;
ing; faults, her hideous imperfections. Appearances. were' cer-&#xD;
tainly against- her,:and she had. made a fool of herself;, and acted&#xD;
&#xD;
a part in a loud, wild style, quite- foreign' to her, and which she&#xD;
hated to remember. Oh! how she wished she had power to blot&#xD;
out all the events of the day, and be again as she was in the morning.&#xD;
Great tears welled up and dropped down upon the lily-pads ; so&#xD;
abandoned to the abomination of desolation was the poor child,&#xD;
that she did not hear a foot-fall upon the gf-avel -walk leading to&#xD;
her penance-chamber, nor the breaking of the Provence rose-bush&#xD;
which climbed over the pillars behind her.&#xD;
" Christabel," saida grave voice at her side.&#xD;
Just a flutter of the blue-veined lids acknowledged his pres-&#xD;
ence, but she did not raise her face, and after an instant of wait-&#xD;
ing, he spoke again, holding out the clustering buds.&#xD;
- " Let there be peace between me and thee, Sappho; you tossed,&#xD;
away my pansies, don't let these innocent flowers share their fate.&#xD;
See how fresh and sweet they are ; take them, Chris."&#xD;
Still she did not move.&#xD;
" Come, that pretty head has been turned away from me quite&#xD;
long enough; it is time for you to smile and be friendly again.&#xD;
.You are not enjoying your party, and it is I who have spoiled it&#xD;
for you; I, who would do so much to.make you happy."&#xD;
With a quick, impatient movement, she turned farther away&#xD;
from him.&#xD;
"A fly once perched on the curled horn of an ox, and said to&#xD;
him: -'Ox, if my weight troubles you I will remove,' and the&#xD;
beast replied: 'Of a' truth, fly, I did not know you were there."&#xD;
As she finished, she glanced over her shoulder at Otho, and lo!&#xD;
his face decked in one of his rare, pleasant smiles_; and the&#xD;
thought shot- through ,her heart like a rang, how much kinder&#xD;
they were than-any sunshine.&#xD;
"That won't do, Sappho," said he, quietly ; "it xis too late for&#xD;
you .even to pretend to ignore my presence, because I am always&#xD;
in your thoughts."&#xD;
She dropped her face, and gazed into the still pool in silence.&#xD;
" Even now," he went on, coming around and seating himself&#xD;
by her, "even now you are trying to find words. in. which 'to say&#xD;

happier when it is skid ; but first take my flowers."&#xD;
Chri, hesitated an instant, and then reached out and took them.&#xD;
ith trembling angers, and -laid tjem softly down on the bench&#xD;
beside her, and controlling .her voice with an effort of which he&#xD;
felt the value,. she lifted her face to,,his, regardless of ia tear-&#xD;
blots, her brown eyes' wimming, and their out-look as pitiful and&#xD;
beseeching as when in the old days;Abe crept to her father's heaet.&#xD;
for forgiveness and comfort.&#xD;
"You speak iruly, sir ; I have something, to say; I have to own&#xD;
my foolish behavior, I. have to ask pardon for my rudeness. You,&#xD;
would be quite right to withdraw your friendship from such a silly&#xD;
child, who has this day shown, herself unworthy of it. I pity&#xD;
myself, for I have fallen in my own esteem; I am not so steady&#xD;
and reliable and discreet as I supposed myself to be."&#xD;
Now here was a first-rate opportunity for Mr. Otho to read her'&#xD;
the lecture which he had fully made up his mind she deserved,&#xD;
and should certainly have; but she blamed herself so ingenuous&#xD;
ly, ;and, looked so pretty in her disconsolate abandonment, her&#xD;
chestnut hair.falling about her flushed face, and touched into sup&#xD;
shine by the last red sun-rays, her arm thrown over the rail, and&#xD;
her scarlet lips drooping in a hopeless, sorrowful curve, that ashe&#xD;
looked, he quite forgot his lofty anger.&#xD;
"Take up n y flowers, Sappho," said he, for answer; 'you are&#xD;
purer and sweeter than they."&#xD;
Still, it must be told that in his secret soul he felt this to be the&#xD;
properattitude of affairs,; he had a right to be implicitly believed.&#xD;
in, not to say worshiped; and obedient gratitude was the safe&#xD;
condition of soul for her to maintain towards him.&#xD;
"Lords of creation, men we call,&#xD;
And they think they rule the whole;&#xD;
But they're much mistaken after all,&#xD;
For-they're under woman's control."&#xD;
at i, most of them; Mr. Otho, was probably an exception.&#xD;

wistful eyes on his face.&#xD;

" Do you like me as much as you did before I leaped that gate?&#xD;
I cannot tell you how wicked I felt when Ic went over ; I almost&#xD;
hoped Zephyr would fall with me, and make au end of every-&#xD;

lie expressed none of the horror or surprise .she feared. to see ;&#xD;
on the contrary he was regarding her with a curious smile.&#xD;
"I think I may safely say, Sappho, that I like you quite as well&#xD;

then we will try Zephyr against Tramp'- your skill against mine;&#xD;

piness. Do you see them? they are never locked ; I can enter'&#xD;
when I please, can I not ?"&#xD;
" Oh yes, Otho ; I love that church ; I have said my prayers&#xD;
there often."&#xD;
Her eyes sought his, however, frightened at his words and&#xD;
their expression, as if lighted' by a strange hidden fire ; but his&#xD;
voice was calm and  quiet as usual.&#xD;
"Sappho, if I were to say to you, what Oliver Cromwell said&#xD;
to Elizabeth Williams that summer evening in her father's gar-&#xD;
den,(it must have been such an evening as this, when the hyacinth&#xD;
odors floated about them, and the daffo-down-dillies nodded at&#xD;
them, and the blue violets sent up their incense,)would you reply&#xD;
as she did?"&#xD;
"I do not, understand you, Otho-your looks nor your words".&#xD;
"Do you not? yet I speak good English, and my eyes are&#xD;
faithful mirrors, which bear just now a most precious image.&#xD;
Suppose I were to say to you, (I, being Oliver) : 'I've been think-&#xD;
lig, sweet ITessie, that I would like to ask you to go up to- yonder&#xD;
church, and come back my wife."  Then you, in your character&#xD;
of Bessie, should reply: '_Dearest Oliver, I've been thinking of&#xD;
that same thing niyself.'"&#xD;
"A most bold and fearless Bessie, I should think," said Chris&#xD;
smiling a little; "but maybe she.spoke truly, .for she married&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"Now, I being Otho, and you Christabel, suppose for a mo-&#xD;
ment that I .were to propound the same inquiry. - Do you think&#xD;
would get a like reply?"&#xD;
"I -think it scarcely becomes you, Otho, to jest upon a subject,"&#xD;
said Chris, blushing a little at the impossible picture thus brought&#xD;
before her; but liftig her eyes to his, clear and clouded.  I&#xD;
wish you would be quiet' and friendly like yourself. I am thank-&#xD;
ful 'to have you'for a' teacher and guide. You have been so good&#xD;
to me this evening. I begin to' believe in myself once more, and&#xD;
I shall try hard to be worthy of your forbearance."&#xD;
"S ppho, darling ! will you.be 'my 'wife ?". He had risen sud-&#xD;
denly and stood before her, one hand resting on the rail beside&#xD;
&#xD;
him, and with the -other he touched lightly her drooping head.&#xD;
His voice rang out steady and even, and he looked proudly eon-&#xD;
fident of success in his suit.&#xD;
With a quick motion she raised her face, all the blood for-&#xD;
sook her cheeks, leaving them as colorless as the white rose-buds&#xD;
which trembled in her grasp, and her great brown eyes questioned&#xD;
his eagerly.&#xD;
"Well Sappho !" said he authoritatively, "it seems that you&#xD;
are making me wait."&#xD;
"You are very wise, Otho, but does it not strike you that I am&#xD;
entirely unfit for that? I neveF for one instant supposed it pos-&#xD;
sible that you could choose me. I am imperfect, unfinished, un-&#xD;
schooled, every way wanting; forgive me if I question your wis-&#xD;
dom. You should have a wife complete in all things."&#xD;
" Christabel, you love me ?"&#xD;
" Oh yes; how could I help that; but your wife ! I should not&#xD;
dare td'take such a place. You are so rigid in your ideas of&#xD;
women.. Oh no, I am not worthy ; I have not the courage."&#xD;
Otho put his hand on her mouth. "I see you are truly sin-&#xD;

You moved about those rooms in your quaint satin dress, and&#xD;
they have been but shrines adorned for your image, to me, ever&#xD;
since. You was afraid of me, too, at first, and would not let mg&#xD;
see yourseyes, and I had a world of trouble to get you to be at&#xD;
ease. But you rewarded mne richly, gloriously. Ah, that was a&#xD;
wonderful day, Sappho. That night after Tramp and ,-had&#xD;
take leave of you, I could not sleep, and I wandered up to  yon-&#xD;

the door with me and come out. my own, my very own. Our&#xD;
marriage there would be a memory for a. life-time. Private-all&#xD;
to ourselves-like a secret kiss. I know you will consent, you&#xD;

with the rich fullness of your glorious gifts you astonished and&#xD;
bewitched me. My life will be worthless if I cannot have you&#xD;

eyes; now sayyour thought. It would be hard for you -t6 find&#xD;
an utterance which should not be pleasant to me."&#xD;
Yous told me that you had chosen your wife. Yo  aid Ih&#xD;
was a lovely lady."&#xD;
"Indeed is she not?  Look down there, Sappho, at the face in&#xD;
the pooh .1 chose arrogantly, now I beg of her to Choose me.&#xD;
I}beg it'asmeekly as I know how. I am trying my best to be-&#xD;

She slipped past his arms, which were, held towards her, and&#xD;
stood quiet and still out of his reach, keeping down her emotions&#xD;
with a self-doninant power which he beheld in wonder.&#xD;
" Stop a moment, Dr. Groenveldt, and hear what I have to&#xD;
say. ICam glad to trust my life to your keeping, for you have'&#xD;
taught nie its use and value. You may make or mnar it as best&#xD;

fixed on his,,in which the doubt and fear. still lurked, veiling half.&#xD;
their joy, and let him fold herin his arms.&#xD;
There was something proud and masterful, almost defying in&#xD;
his very caresses, mingling with their passionate tenderness, and&#xD;
a glad smile of. triumph mantled his features when the unrestful&#xD;
look crept out of her eyes, leaving'them full of love and peace.&#xD;
She was not settled and at home in her new happiness,&#xD;
though ; for she soon broke away from him, and the hot blood&#xD;
dashed over her face and neck.&#xD;
' What is it, darling ?" said he, keeping his hold upon .her.&#xD;
hand. " What most unwelcome thought has so cruelly chased&#xD;
the love-light from. your pretty eyes, and hardened your fhce so&#xD;
suddenly.?"&#xD;
1 "had forgotten, Otho; your. mother does not like me, she&#xD;
will not have me for a daughter."&#xD;
"Will not!" he replied, tightening his grasp upon her hand.&#xD;
"My wife need fear nobody. I shall be her shelter from all the&#xD;
world, and I am the center from which her happiness will _come.&#xD;
ly mother has excellent ideas, and is very strong in them. I&#xD;
am strong also. You are to be near her this year, you know,-un-&#xD;

talents, and she will help you in the studies you love best.. You&#xD;
will respect her, because she is well worthy of honor, and you&#xD;
will love her for my sake. My father loves you already. You&#xD;
shall help him class his bugs and butterflies, and I'll let, you into&#xD;

that you would like to speak, and don't know just how. I shall&#xD;
relish the utterance ; I wonder what it is this time. Give it voice,&#xD;
Sappho."&#xD;
" The prospect you offer is very delightful, Otho; but how&#xD;
shall I reconcile this sudden change of plan, this abandoning of&#xD;
your business,-with the steadfast firmniess of your character?"&#xD;
He studied her in curious enjoyment. " So soon, Sappho! do&#xD;
you already begin to bring me to book for my actions? a bad&#xD;
look-out for my future. But to tell you truly, I've been over&#xD;
the same ground myself. You draw me toward you like a mag-&#xD;
net, and I've made up my mind to give myself one happy year&#xD;
.before I launch out to make my fortune. Can you wait for me&#xD;
three or four years? Your Alpine tonr was to be at twenty,&#xD;
you. remember, and we will go up yonder (pointing to thecchape,)&#xD;
and then we will start on our travels. I must have a - positive&#xD;
position, a prospect of certain living, and then we will commence&#xD;
to work out the problem of our lives together.. The position&#xD;
waits my acceptance, and a couple of years will accomplish the.&#xD;
rest."&#xD;
"But, Otho, I think I have plenty of money, or shall have&#xD;
sometime."&#xD;
"I have not the least objection. But I hav'nt, at least not&#xD;
much, and I must get some. I intend to be the head of my house,&#xD;
to give to you, not receive from you anything except pure love&#xD;
and precious'happiness. While you are at Rosenbloom, digging&#xD;
among the dead languages, I will be jogging about in that rusty.&#xD;

. day she will come to me and beg of me with many sweet kisses&#xD;
an opera box and diamonds, and I must'have them for, her."-&#xD;
" Otho!"-said Chris, trying to read his face, (her own full of&#xD;
secret trouble.)  "You know that such things are.not in all my'&#xD;
thoughts ; fine dressing is not a: favorite vanity."&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.      405&#xD;
&#xD;
"' But I choose you to shine. You told me once that yot would&#xD;
like a life of luxury, and I intend that you shall try it."&#xD;
Suddenly Chris' face broke into a mischievous smile.&#xD;
"Give me the key," said Otho.&#xD;
"I was thinking how my mother would look if she should hear&#xD;
what you are saying to me. She would call you very wicked,&#xD;
and speak disgustedly of the beggarly elements- of this world."&#xD;
" Despising the good gifts of the bountiful God is not piety.&#xD;
He giveth us all things richly to enjoy. The thin meagre creed&#xD;
which frowns upon beauty, and shuts out amusements and sensu-&#xD;
ous delights, is not my religion. We will not be wicked people.&#xD;
We will lead good pure lives; we will be happy aand use our&#xD;
means to make others happy, sharers in our good gifts; and we&#xD;
will not~reject or despise the least little leaflet which unfolds for&#xD;
our pleasure. But, dearest, you must be patient and brave, and&#xD;
I know you will be busy, for you are - a good worker ; and you&#xD;
must always come to me with your difficulties, and let me drive&#xD;
them off, and be sure and fold me close in your heart. I'm an&#xD;
exacting fellow, Sappho."&#xD;
"You are aJ1 I have, Otho. I had nothing this morning. I&#xD;
found my treasure here behind the roses, and I will even consent&#xD;
to be gorgeous and splendid at your request," replied Chris with&#xD;
a bright smile, but yet with a tear in her voice, "how I wish we&#xD;
could just stop here in our lives a little while. Why cannot you&#xD;
command the sun to stand still as Joshua did?"&#xD;
" I can command, Sappho. I believe I am rather fond of it.&#xD;
I shall command my wife, and shall expect her to obey-me, but the&#xD;
sun regards me less than he did the hero of the rams-horns. You&#xD;
see he moves on his road as grandly gorgeous as though I were&#xD;
not. Only the golden glory on the hill-top will be left to mark his&#xD;
path presently.' Come, let us walk a little way up the path;we&#xD;
are to tread that day together."  Leaning on his arm, her hand&#xD;
firmly clasped in his; she walked along the winding way, and he&#xD;
drew from her all her troubles and trials, and got the key to the&#xD;
moods of the day. Her eyes happened to light upon her gaunt-&#xD;
lets, sticking out of her pocket, and she said reproachfully :&#xD;

"Who toldyou that I did believe so?"1&#xD;
"cWhy, I heard her myself, telling you a long tale about'them."&#xD;

It was so delightful to feel that she. belonged to Othoy and so&#xD;

moments, and Chandy shouted himself hoarse and Jan Vedder&#xD;

came:dova   U TUader the pinetrees, onFa rustic: bench whichcom,.&#xD;

his: notice the distant delights. of the landscpe. She had a.:very&#xD;
thin white hand, and she made' the most o it. : As she raised it&#xD;
before the Captain's eyes, he thought what a whopper of a d'ia.&#xD;
mond he would buy for the third finger, if it really got to be Mrs&#xD;
Slodum's. He had not touched upon the all: important subject,&#xD;
since their adventure in themeadow, either by word or look, and&#xD;
Dulcet felt as if the promised settlement were slipping througli&#xD;
her-fingers, and"nerved up' to. desperation, she. heroieally resolved&#xD;
to clinch the' thing at once:&#xD;
"cCaptain Slocum, did you- really mean what you said this&#xD;
afternoon'?"&#xD;
"aAs how ma'am ?" inquired the' Captain, squinting-iite-thetree;&#xD;
trunk with one-eye. shut, (there' was, an ant in it tugging a white&#xD;
ball twice its' own size;); and he dived into his- pocket and! brought&#xD;
out his jackknife, with murderous intent. Poor fellow ! he knew&#xD;
well" enough that his days of liberty were ended, and though he&#xD;
had' made up' his- mind,: e-hated to'be brought' into"the traees-as-a&#xD;
horse: does- whohas had a long summer in pastures&#xD;
'"You understand puffcklg sir, to what' refere, and if yotr do&#xD;
not'intend to make. yoi- words good; ,Imust say you took aeery&#xD;
unfair aantage of' my weakness '.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Captain was so ardent in his pursuit; of his prey speaking&#xD;
the bark quite savagely, always just where the ant had been, that&#xD;
poor Dulcet's face fell and she- got tearful and hopeless.&#xD;
"If you are a man of honor, you will speak up at once, sir !&#xD;
If you don't, you' may go down directly, and I will deseend&#xD;
alone."'&#xD;
"I would'nt, my dear." The Capain snapped his knife together&#xD;
and restored it t&amp;amp; his pocket, and gazed at the slim teacherin&#xD;
whimsical resignation. "i I would'nt if"j: wa you.-I'd  Wait=for&#xD;
me. It begins to look' as if you'd goneit alone about as lbngas&#xD;
is good for your constitution. I'm agreeable to rmaning a pir&#xD;

my side.  've got the money- and, you've got the brains, aid we&#xD;
can set up for ourselves a mbst any time, that i. if' yoU say 'o&#xD;
I ain't dead sot on it by no means. If you don't think it will pay&#xD;
you handsomely, don't invest. Your head is'nt in the 'collar, and&#xD;
you can bolt, you know."&#xD;
Dulcet sighed. This was so different to the love making she&#xD;
used to picture, in her ronrantic youth, but such as it was, she was&#xD;
obliged to make the most of it.&#xD;
"But I could'nt leave my mother, Captain, not even for you,"&#xD;
she said quite heroically, for she was doubtful how he would relish&#xD;
such an appendage, men not being generally fond of mothers-in-&#xD;
law, and she made haste to offset her declaration, by the remark,&#xD;
"of course I don't object to morigeration. I have been teacher&#xD;
too long for that."&#xD;
" Ahem ! Yes, just so ma'am," answered the puzzled lover.&#xD;
"I am glad of it ; just my mind, but I hope you don't take me for&#xD;
a heathen. I never thought of asking you' to leave old Miss&#xD;
Pettibone. I think a comfortable, easy-going old woman is a nice&#xD;
ornament to a chimney corner."&#xD;
Dulcet 'experienced quite a glow of love or gratitude or some&#xD;
such emotion, and offered the Captain her white fingers, which he&#xD;
took with careful politeness. " You are very good,'' said she,&#xD;
"and we will consider the affair all settled."&#xD;
They had a delightful ride home. Deborah invited Dick and&#xD;

Chris had a little broken cordial-glass under her mirror, hold-&#xD;

she had for tending them so carefully. She got up at four o'clock&#xD;
to sketch them. You might have taken the little white toillete&#xD;
for a shrine, if you had seen the young girl kneeling there, watch-&#xD;
ing them with wrapt looks. After the third day they drooped and&#xD;
faded: her worship could not save them. Thenai she brought out&#xD;
her box of water colors, and painted her sketch of them. If she&#xD;
had been preparing for the great exhibition she could not have&#xD;

when she could no longer preserve her dear pansies, she cover d&#xD;
them in, and bound them about with one of'Vher shining curls,&#xD;
and kept the casket still upon the white shrine. Her flower of&#xD;

CH APTER' T1V ZN T Y=-IX T H'.&#xD;
THE 'SEWING SOCIETY AT THE DEACON'S.&#xD;
Mrs. Deacon Williams was ill at ease. She had got to have&#xD;
the Sewing Society. She rose from her couch, and threw up the&#xD;
window-'and looked with. horror and dismay at the threatening&#xD;
clouds. She put -forth her night-capped 'head, for a more extended&#xD;
vision,, and this brought out ' conspicuously the modest covering&#xD;
of the sheep's head pattern, and, of good strong factory-cotton&#xD;
withwhich she was accustomed to cover her sconce o'nights. Use-&#xD;
ful gear for elderly females, who are accustomed to lay aside their&#xD;
back hair upon retiring, but positivelynot ornamental. Mrs. Wil-&#xD;
liams did not "'sleep in her teeth," because as she explained, the&#xD;
pesky things hurt 'her goombs, and being sore vexed of "heart-.&#xD;
burn," she was slowly .munching, rhubarb, leaning meanwhile&#xD;
upon her elbows.- The puckery nature of the drug, and the&#xD;
squinting at the clouds, caused her to screw her ripe countenance-&#xD;
somewhat out of its most agreeable contour, and she heard a sup-&#xD;
pressed titter under the window, and withdrawing her gaze from&#xD;
the heavens, she sent a withering glance earthward. It encoun-&#xD;
tered Zoe and Sabrina, each with a basket on her arm. They&#xD;
were returning from a visit to some of the sick Gonecussets.&#xD;
As she made the unwelcome discovery, she drew in her sheep's&#xD;
head with a sharp jerk, which brought it smartly in' collision with&#xD;
the window, and she dropped the sash with an acute accent, which&#xD;
made the panes to quiver and 'quake, thus losing the pleasant&#xD;
" good morning " which the young ladies sent up to her, and the'&#xD;
merry laugh which accompanied it.'&#xD;
(410)&#xD;
&#xD;
" What upon airth's there good-for-nothing girls galevanting&#xD;
round after this time of day ! My night cap '11 be in everybody's&#xD;
mouth before breakfast time."&#xD;
"Your night cap, Miss Williams"! A curious morel as you&#xD;
may say in a manner seeminly. Good night cap though, nothing&#xD;
to be said agin it."&#xD;
"Well ! I der say you call' that a joke, Deacon, but I'm free&#xD;
to confess' I don't see the pint. I der say, you'd like to jine in a&#xD;
laugh at your wife's expense. Your poor patient slave," and she&#xD;
niutteringly added as she settled her stockings, " Jest you let me&#xD;
catch you at it, if you think it's healthy."&#xD;
The excellent Deacon had learned from long experience that&#xD;
it was best to knock under, when his darling was a little put out,&#xD;
and therefore he subsided beneath the bed clothes, and spoke no&#xD;
farther word.&#xD;
The mortification of having been seen in her early toilette, the&#xD;
blow she had' given herself in her haste to withdraw her mature&#xD;
charms from  scrutiny too close, and the certainty of having her&#xD;
carpets soiled by the feet of the populace, made doubly sure now&#xD;
by the pattering of the rain drops, all conspired sorely to ruffle&#xD;
the good lady's temper, (not too serene at best of times.)  A bad&#xD;
look-out for' Sonsie and the unlucky children. The deacon's for-&#xD;
lorn endeavor to escape by ducking under the bed clothes was all'&#xD;
in vain too, for as soon as she had gulped in her teeth, she turned&#xD;
on him.&#xD;
" I should really admire to know, Deacon Williams, if you ex-&#xD;
pect to lay abed all day. If you don't stir your stumps, I'll just&#xD;
shake up the feathers and turn you under."  A  threat she was&#xD;
fully capable of executing, for she was as stout and powerful as he&#xD;
was thin and weazened. "I do despise a lazy man above ground,"'.&#xD;
and she stalked- out and banged the door after her, with what dear&#xD;
Charley Lamb used to call " a wooden' danin," and he heard her&#xD;
shrill tones in the distance scolding violently. Slowly emerging&#xD;
from his shelter, and raising his little body into a sitting posture,&#xD;
the dcaeo- shook his head and communed with himself.&#xD;
"P'raps you would'also 'admiren to shake up the sod and'turn me&#xD;
&#xD;

under that, but we will put off that little tea-party a while, IProv-&#xD;
idence permitting. You can't despise a lazy man, ma'am more&#xD;
than I do a scolding woman. What does Solomon .say?  ' Her&#xD;
feet take hold on.Hell, and her way goeth down to the pit,' and&#xD;
I agree with Solomon. I know it's so."&#xD;
At this point of .his toilette and his meditations, the Deacon&#xD;
stopped to chuckle, and so intense was his relish of the fun, that&#xD;
his shoulders went up to his ears, and his eyes disappeared among&#xD;
the wrinkles, till he opened them to wink shyly at his gold sleeve-&#xD;
buttons. Now what do you suppose was the subject of the lov-&#xD;
ing husband's mirth. He was recalling his will! He was thinking&#xD;
how he had fixed his help-meet ; tied her up and fastened her for&#xD;
life. The document was drawn by. Esquire. Hitchcock, as strong&#xD;
as it could be, duly signed and attested, and safely locked in the&#xD;
Gonecusset vault, with the bonds, mortgages, and title deeds which&#xD;
gave it value. He appetizingly recited it to himself.&#xD;
I give and bequeath to my wife, Silence, the use of ten thousand&#xD;
dollars, during her life, to be forfeited if she marries, and, at her&#xD;
death it shall be divided between the Gonecusset Academy and&#xD;
the Stone Church, as a perpetual fund. The interest to be ap-&#xD;
propriated by the trustees according to their best judgment. In&#xD;
case of my wife Silence's second marriage, it shall be 'immediately&#xD;
applied as-above.&#xD;
Only men and Deacons could stoop to make such wills, a woman&#xD;
would never descend to such a deed. They are getting quite too&#xD;
common of late, and are an undying disgrace to their authors.&#xD;
There are no words to express the small mean injustice which&#xD;
deprives the faithful wife of what she has helped to earn and to&#xD;
keep. Why not burn her on the funeral pile at once. It seemed&#xD;
almost aos if the Deacon would ha-ve liked to die so as to enjoy&#xD;
his joke.&#xD;
There ! Miss Williams," said he, emphasizing with the Jhair-&#xD;
brush. "You had better mind your p's and q's, or you'll be over-&#xD;
taken like a thief in the night as you may say seemingly."&#xD;
Just at this point, the Deacon was interrupted by his weaker&#xD;
vessel, who threw open the door, and called out:&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW 'GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTERR.     413&#xD;
&#xD;
" Air you coming down, or air you not! That's what I want&#xD;
to know."&#xD;
"In a second, my dear. In one jiffy !" answered the Deacon,&#xD;
but she startled him so, tha t he dropped the hair-brush and jumped&#xD;
as if shot, and got hastily into the residue of his garments, be-&#xD;
neath her severe eyes, which covered, all his motions, like a search&#xD;
warrant. He was fond of browbeating his wife, but he found it&#xD;
safer to have the lecture out by himself, as it saved all unprofita-&#xD;
ble recriminations, but if he did not crow very loudly on his own&#xD;
dunghill, he made up for his enforced silence, among his Gone-&#xD;
cussets, and he knocked off little ends from their wages, and took&#xD;
it out of them in a hundred ingenious ways, and harangued =them&#xD;
with vast stateliness and dignity.&#xD;
Mrs. Williams, seeing what a bright, active, wide-awake girl&#xD;
Sonsie Eagan was, and how tidy and smart she looked in her new&#xD;
clothes, was seized with an ardent desire to do something for her,&#xD;
and how so well could she aid her as by taking her into the bo-&#xD;
som of her family.&#xD;
" She can do all the waiting' and running, and the arrants, and&#xD;
lots of work besides, if she is kep up to it ; and i'll see that she&#xD;

She had not made her call upon Ruth yet, in her quality of&#xD;
Deaconess, and she dressed herself in her best -one fine day, and&#xD;
presented her portly person at the Horse-Shoe, and was admitted&#xD;
by Sonsie herself, who took in her proportions and her apparel,&#xD;
and made a mental estimate of her, with the sharpness she had&#xD;
acquired by her -street' practice.  The Deaconess stated her&#xD;
errand with the girFs eyes fixed upon her, 'and when she&#xD;
made a prospective offer of wages in a year or two, and ad-&#xD;
ded: " which of course you can't afford, Miss Blair,"being as&#xD;
your man is only one of our work-folks," Sonsie turned her face&#xD;
from one to the other with a queer grin on it, which seemed. al-&#xD;
most like a mental comparison of the two ladies, who were so&#xD;
totally opposite in appearance and manner; and then she 'hugged&#xD;

and kissed several chuckles into Pigeon's neck. Mrs. Williams&#xD;
added this finishing remark with peculiarly spiteful appetite, for she&#xD;
hadbeensput- out that very day .at seeing Ruth and her boy riding&#xD;
past in Sabrina Bradshaw's pony curricle,,and the three enjoying&#xD;
each other hugely. And she .knew her to be awelcome guest in&#xD;
the Roaring River families, where all her money and her preten&#xD;
tions had not as yet gotten her a foothold. Ruth foolishly red-&#xD;
dened at her coarse malice; (she would 'have counted it fun a&#xD;
few months ago,) and. she had two minds to refuse altogether&#xD;
to part:with Sonsie. She was attached to her,.,and found her&#xD;
great help with Pigeon, who doted on her; but she reflected that&#xD;
Mrs.;Williams had but spoken the truth;.she could not afford a&#xD;
servant, and she was ashamed of the secret bitterness the avowal&#xD;
brought to her. Sonsie adapted herself so readily to'circumstan-&#xD;
ces, .and with such 'bold confidence in her own powers, that she&#xD;
did not fear her capacity for pushing herself forward, and taking&#xD;
her own part if need be. Therefore she resigned her .to Dame'&#xD;
Williams' tender mercies, resolving to keep an eye upon her,, and&#xD;
bring her away if she fared. too hardly among the old and young&#xD;
barbarians of that household. She had a good motherly talk with&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"One thing you may be" sure of, Sonsie ; I shall always be&#xD;
your friend while you are a good girl, ..and that I hope will be&#xD;
always."&#xD;
"Indade, Mrs. Blair," said Sonsie, characteristically, her arms&#xD;
on her hip n;her favorite attitude ; "when I. do anything I blush&#xD;
for, it's far away from your .swate eyes that I'll hide myself. I1&#xD;
don't pretend to be as innocent as a lamb; I know there's wick- .&#xD;
edness walking about on two legs; maybe I'm wrong, but it seems&#xD;
to me that the. misery is to blame for almost all of it.  I think&#xD;
everybody would'like to be good and true if they had the chance;,&#xD;
I know all the Irish girlswould anyhow, (a mischievous twinkle&#xD;
inher eye pointed her-remark,) and 'tis, meself will be the good&#xD;
friend to you, Mrs. Blair. You know, the little tale you read me&#xD;
3out of Pigeon's- picturesbook;;. though you are not a bit like a&#xD;
hon, because it's a tender dove that you. are intirely, it's meself&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW. GOLDSMIT 'S :DAUGHTER.           -415a&#xD;
that'il be the good little mouse to you. Me new mistress is a fine&#xD;
large lady, and I'll get lots, of teachin' out of her; she's got an&#xD;
awful eye and a big fist, but it's just meself that's.not afraid of&#xD;
her at all at all. You don't need me now, but an Irish heart&#xD;
never forgets true kindness, and I'll be con ing to kape the house&#xD;
for ye. I've niver a friend but ye that's the valie of .a sup of&#xD;
crame, and I'll be a credit to yes yet. I'm not goin' to stay on&#xD;
t' e peor little- bit that I am now always ; it's idication that I'll be&#xD;
after gettin',. somehow."&#xD;
And so, with a brave heart, in her breast and a tear in her&#xD;
honest blue eye, Sonsie kissed Pigeon one fine morning, and with&#xD;
all her worldly gear tied up in a very small bundle, she turned&#xD;
her back upon the, friendly shelter of the Horse-Shoe, and made&#xD;
ready to do battle with the world on her.own account once more.&#xD;
She felt a childish pride in living in a great house, and studied its&#xD;
appointments with curious interest; and it would have done you-&#xD;
good to see her throw open the parlor .door to visitors. If she&#xD;
had. owned the place she could not have looked better .satisfied.&#xD;
She was soon =installed in a round of occupations which kept&#xD;
her faculties employed to the utmost. Mrs. Williams' service was&#xD;
no joke; she knew so well by actual experience how much work&#xD;
could be accomplished in a given time, and, .was so resolute that&#xD;
her help should come up, to her ideas, that they hado use all the&#xD;
strength nature had bestowed upon them,.and they laid weary&#xD;
heads upon their pillows, when their day's tasks were finished.&#xD;
Mrs. Williams enjoyed, taking it out.of Bridget and Sonsie as&#xD;
thoroughly as the Deacon. did out of his Gonecussets. Bridget&#xD;
grumbled and .growled, and slammed the.doors,,,and burned the&#xD;
eatables, but little Sonsie danced and sung, as merry as .a lark, as&#xD;
soon as her mistress' back was turned, and was, full of jibes and&#xD;
fun all day long. She amused and humanized the young barba-&#xD;
rians with her tales, where glib humor and tender pathos mingled&#xD;
in startling combinations; and her true honest eyes were often&#xD;
filled with tears when the darlings of her stories were suffering,&#xD;
(they were always children,) and she had the right "to gar hersel'&#xD;
great wi' her an fiddle."&#xD;

She had a stand-up -fight with sweet Master Baxter, of the&#xD;
speckled countenance, and warty paws, in which her early street&#xD;
training stood her in good stead, and she taught him in a thorough&#xD;
and well punctuated lesson to mind his own business, and shielded&#xD;
the younger ones.from his brutal tyranny.&#xD;
"You'd better go back to gathering up 'swill, paddy whack,"&#xD;
said he, after an'encounter in which he had decidedly the worst&#xD;
of it.&#xD;
"Indade, then, an' if I do, it's, yourself is the very bit of nasti-&#xD;
ness I'd scrape up first of all and get yes clean out of the way;&#xD;
but the swate illegant pigs would niver ate ye at all at all, and&#xD;
d'ye mind that same, honey."&#xD;
Baxter went bawling to his mother, and when she brought Son-&#xD;
sie to book for beating her son, she replied:&#xD;
"I'mnot engaged to take pounding for part of me education;&#xD;
it's tiecooking that I'm to learn, wid ye but."&#xD;
She ran all the'errands, and after a few blunders, in which her&#xD;
good-humor bore easily the laugh she caused, her shrewdness was&#xD;
rarely at fault. Sent one morning to market, the man asked her&#xD;
what sort of a piece she wished.'&#xD;
She didn't tell me to get raw or lean, but you must leave ot&#xD;
the bones, anyhow."&#xD;
The hearty laugh which greeted her, gave her a lesson to abide&#xD;
by the letter of her instructions afterwards.&#xD;
"onsie" was the name ofteneet repeated in the house; it was&#xD;
a spell with which to conjure all sorts of things above and below.&#xD;
She began to clean the boots, and Bax came and grinned at her,&#xD;
while she whistled a jig and scrubbed for dear life, and called her&#xD;
names; but Dame Williams said "the men-folks might clean their&#xD;
own hoof/ers; she wasn't going to keep a girl for that ;" and&#xD;
Baxter was forced to resume his occupation, much to his disgust.&#xD;
He tried to pummel Sonsie's head with the blacking-brush, but&#xD;
failed, and got his own well polished instead.&#xD;
In spite ofPhindrances, Sonsie would get on; she leaned all&#xD;
that Bridget could teach her,"she' swept so that her martinet of a&#xD;
mistress could find no fault, and she scrubbed her rosy cheeks,&#xD;
&#xD;
(well filled out and plump now,) under the pump, and applied&#xD;
herself to pot-hooks and hangers in the evening, which she coaxed&#xD;
Mary Ann to set for her ; and spelled out all the children's prim.&#xD;
ers. Thanks to her cheerful, elastic temperament, which rose&#xD;
above trifles, and laughed at vexations, even Miss Brandon&#xD;
could not fatigue her, and she was as expert in taking it out of&#xD;
people as either her host or hostess. Mrs. Williams: called up&#xD;
her help early in the morning, on principle, (she said.)&#xD;
"It's a drefful 'had habit for girls to lay a-bed, especially help.&#xD;
They ought to 'get up and read the Testament, if they haven't&#xD;
got anything better to do ;" but she generally found something for&#xD;
them without recourse to the Testament.&#xD;
Sonsie was up at day-dawn all the long June days, working in&#xD;
the garden and weeding the flowers, labor of which she made&#xD;
play. It seemed as if the posies nodded to her, and loved -her,&#xD;
and laughed with her. She got a whole apron-full of roots and&#xD;
bulbs, which she conveyed to the Horse-Shoe, and she made a&#xD;
bed and planted them before anybody was up, regarding them as&#xD;
spoils from the Philistines. You see she had a little lost the dif-&#xD;
ference between meum and tuum in her Bohemian existence,.and&#xD;
looked upon flowers as the gift of the good God to all his chil-&#xD;
dren. When Ruth, instead of being pleased with her labor,&#xD;
looked very grave, and pointed out: her sin, she, was entirely&#xD;
crest-fallen, and pulled up the whole plantation ruthlessly, and&#xD;
carried them back, and went straight and boldly to her mistress&#xD;
and confessed her fault, and took her scolding, and was thereafter&#xD;
scrupulously exact.&#xD;
The meals at the Deacons were not.the gayest re-unions imag-&#xD;
inable. The six children came frowzy and noisy ; whatever the&#xD;
young fry could reach they helped themselves to, and what they&#xD;
could not so readily come at they poked after, standing on their&#xD;
chair-rounds; and in their fishing they often upset slight obstacles,&#xD;
such as salt-cellars and tea-cups.&#xD;

as a retiring-place to be kept in abeyance, and who liked her sur-&#xD;

household if she'put herself to it, threw out some hints on the&#xD;
subject of-a waiteress, and offered to induct Sonsie into her duties.&#xD;
Mrs. Williams nimbly consented, and the girl was fitted toa long&#xD;
white apron, tied around her neck, and Belle found her an apt&#xD;
scholar, and her sense of the ludicrous was as keen, and her in-&#xD;
tense relish of the fun of her mistakes as exquisite as her teach-,&#xD;
er's ; for instance, she never got over bringing the dust-pan and&#xD;
hearth-broom to brush the crumbs, one company dinner, before&#xD;
she had learned the use of the silver scraper, about the French&#xD;
name of which Mrs. Williams was quite in the dark.&#xD;
The young Williamses had been left behind in the family&#xD;
scramble after elegance, and they needed more teaching than she&#xD;
did, the elegance being a company parade, mostly. They still ate&#xD;
their dinners often with the table against the kitchen wall, stand-&#xD;
ing up to it, elbowing and pushing,-and not unfrequently exchang-&#xD;
ing fisticuffs, and getting treated to a promiscuous boxing all&#xD;
around from the maternal, who, when the fun got too fast and&#xD;
furious, was wont to come down upon them like a wolf, on the&#xD;
fold.   '&#xD;
.I do believe my young ones are wuss than anybody's elses," she&#xD;
would say, not relishing the crop of weeds she was reaping in&#xD;
place of the loving-kindness and gentleness she might have sowed&#xD;
and didn't.&#xD;
On this particular morning of lowering clouds and dismal fore-&#xD;
bodings, the olives all seemed to exert themselves to be especially&#xD;
numerous, and the maternal scolding only added to the hubbub,&#xD;
Belle, who always made it a point to be late to breakfast, where&#xD;
the hostess would bear it, was not down yet ; and the Deacon&#xD;
swallowed his fried mush in silence.&#xD;
"I declare, you ain't 'fit to live amongst human bein's; you&#xD;
ought:to have a trough along of the pigs. There, Bax! why don't&#xD;
you put your foot on to't ?  Settin' there, layin' on your elbows !,&#xD;
There ain't a bit of manners in you; you must take after your&#xD;
pa's folks."&#xD;
"I should say ma was a putting her foot into it now. Why&#xD;
don't you speak up, pa? I shan't let my wife sass me that way.&#xD;
Women ain't no great 'shakes, no how."&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
The Deacon pretended to be plunged in devout meditation, but&#xD;
the children struck up an aggravating giggle, which Mary Ann&#xD;
vainly tried to squelch, glancing fearfully at her mother. Tall as&#xD;
she was, she came in now and then for a little discipline, when it&#xD;
was flying about; and Payson shied a fried potatoe at Sonsie,&#xD;
which missed its aim, and plumped into pa's coffee-cup.&#xD;
" Shet up! every one of you ! Anybody'd think this house was&#xD;
a bedlam.&#xD;
"Jes' so, ma, that's a fact ; anybody'd think our house was a&#xD;
bed room," mimicing his mother's voice, thinking himself safe&#xD;
out of her reach; but Baxter had miscalculated, and forgot the&#xD;
long iron spoon with which she was ladling out the mush. It was&#xD;
brought home to him with a whack, which made him jump, and&#xD;
pushing back his chair so as to send it over with a crash, he dash-&#xD;
ed out, breathing out threatenings and slaughter. This charming&#xD;
little episode had the effect to calm the others, and silence reigned.&#xD;
As they were about leaving the table, Baxter returned swinging&#xD;
a dead fowl by the leg.&#xD;
"Look a-here, pa!. If this ain't darned mean. I'll kill that&#xD;
old tom-cat the first time I catch him out anywhere. My biggest&#xD;
rooster, and a real burry-pouter, besides. I'll rainbow him; I'll&#xD;
find out what his skin is stuffed with."&#xD;
"I think plain duty calls me to step round and speak to widder&#xD;
Goldsmith, my dear, on this subject, as you may say. This is a&#xD;
trespass, a subject for damages ; a fine idea truly, if we've come&#xD;
to the pass of not being allowed to raise fowls. under our own&#xD;
vine and fig-tree, so to speak, seemingly, in this christian land of&#xD;
liberty. Oh well, ' we are all a band of brothers, we tarry but, a&#xD;
night.'"&#xD;
"This rooster was fit to bile," replied his wife, feeling of the&#xD;
defunct chicken's ribs, and jerking out a feather or two. "Of&#xD;
course they'11 have to pay for't, if you can fix it on to the old cat&#xD;
killin' on't."&#xD;
"What are you talking about, ma? didn't I see the varmint&#xD;
with my rooster in his mouth ?  I shied a stone at him, but he&#xD;
wouldn't drop him till I got most up to him; I thought how't he&#xD;
was goin' to fight me ; I wish I'd broke his leg for him."&#xD;

" It's a shame ! pity to lose it. You might take it down to old&#xD;
Miss Pettingill, she'd make a dinner out on't with a piece of pork.&#xD;
You need'nt let on the cat killed it, she might spleen again it if&#xD;
you did. Now I look at it, I guess it's been a failin some time;&#xD;
'taint so drefful fat, and its back is kinder twisted ; but t'will do&#xD;
well enough for the old maid, she has to scrimp considerable."&#xD;
Catching Sonsie's eyes fixed upon her very enjoyingly, she&#xD;
added: "Not but what I'd cook it myself, only 'twould'nt be a&#xD;
moufull for my family. Come Bax, start along, and go right to&#xD;
school from there."&#xD;
"You must be sick ! Do you think I'm going to paddle way&#xD;
down the flats with that thing? I'd smile to see myself."&#xD;
" Well Sonsie, you shall run. I like to-be charitable when I&#xD;
can as well as not, and. a chicken is a chicken, if the cat did kill&#xD;
it."&#xD;
Deacon Williams brushed his hat up-stairs in his bed-room.&#xD;
His wife did not allow him to use the fine brush which was kept&#xD;
for show on the rose-wood hat-stand in the spacious hall. He&#xD;
went out of the back door. His wife said she "could'nt abear to&#xD;
see everybody racin and tearin through the front hall, wearing&#xD;
out things, when the back door was more convenierter, and a&#xD;
good stun walk all round the house."&#xD;
So the deacon meekly departed by that portal.' Sometimes he&#xD;
thought he did not have the full amount of enjoyment out of his&#xD;
elegant mansion, for the plan of which he paid the architect five&#xD;
hundred dollars ; but there was no help for it, and he compensated&#xD;
himself by the snuggest of offices at the foundry, where there&#xD;
were easy chairs and all sorts of conveniences.S&#xD;
The deacon was a pillar in the church, but he was a thin little&#xD;
man, so meanly weazened that he absolutely disliked George&#xD;
Blair, because of his splendid physique and tremendous propor-&#xD;
tions. Nevertheless he made the most of himself, and pulled up&#xD;
his shirt collar as he paused at the widow Goldsmith's door.&#xD;
" Good-morning, ma'am," said he, taking off his hat and bring-&#xD;
ing his hair carefully forward over the bald place ; "fine still&#xD;
&#xD;
morning, dropping a little,.but we need rain. There is also a&#xD;
lamentable spiritual dearth in the midst of us."&#xD;
" So there will be till the session stirs round and gets rid of&#xD;
the backsliders. dan't look for no revival with all them in it."&#xD;
Though the widow talked pious, she was armed to the teeth.&#xD;
She smelt business, and well knew that she needed all her facul-&#xD;
ties awake when she dealt with the deacon.&#xD;
"Searching discourse last Sabbath, widder. Dr. Perfect is a&#xD;
great preacher, as you may say."&#xD;
"About the average, I should consider." She was fresh from&#xD;
the thunders of the Great Tribulation, and considered Dr. Perfect&#xD;
as very small deer indeed.&#xD;
Finding that he should get no help from the widow, the deacon&#xD;
launched at once into the momentous object of his visit, which&#xD;
he pompously set forth with many words. "Now; ma'am, what&#xD;
shall we do about it?"&#xD;
" Kill the critter, deacon, if you can. Pizen won't do it, for&#xD;
I've tried it myself. He's got more'n nine lives, I believe."&#xD;
" We will try to find out where he keeps a few of them, ma'am.&#xD;
My Bax is a Nimrod with his gun, and perhaps a ball will do the&#xD;
business," replied the deacon with neighborly jocoseness. " I am&#xD;
glad to find you so reasonable ; we won't say anything about the&#xD;
fowl already killed, unless you would feel better to change off for&#xD;
one of yours ; some would, we are all 4 band of brothers, as you&#xD;
may say, seemingly. Good-morning, ma'am. We must not be&#xD;
slothful workers in the vineyard."&#xD;
" Just hold on one minute, deacon. I've been wanting to speak&#xD;
to you some time. I suppose you know that your Bax put&#xD;
Creampitcher's eye out he-aving stones at her ; a very valable&#xD;
cow, deacon, worth at least a hundred dollars, and the sale of her&#xD;
is about 9pilte. Of course you expect to pay damages. I shall&#xD;
lay 'em at fifty dollars at least."&#xD;
" How do you identify my son as the.individual who committed&#xD;
the action. She might have run against suthing somewheres."&#xD;
" I see him myself. I catched him whalin her down in the&#xD;
lane ; his dog had holt on her, and he was layin'on with a club.&#xD;

If it had'nt been for scandal I'd have brought it right before the&#xD;
church. I've been waitin for you to call, as you never paid no&#xD;
attention 'to the message I sent you."&#xD;
"Message, ma'am; I never got no message. (The widow&#xD;
knew better.) I'm in a hurry now, I can't stop any longer. I&#xD;
promised to meet a party down.:at the office. Some time I'll in-&#xD;
quire into the thing.  Good-morning, ma'am, good-morning.&#xD;
Don't let me. keep you any longer. I know you are no idler in&#xD;
the - vineyard. Your good. works follow you. Your name is&#xD;
savory in the church. I noticed your contribution in the last&#xD;
Herald. Well, we are all a band of brothers, as you may say."&#xD;
Out under the great-tulip-tree, whose broad leaves were a per-&#xD;
feet -shelter from the rain, sat Master Chandy, in his shirt sleeves,&#xD;
with his guitar on the rustic table before him, and his fly-book in&#xD;
his hand. He was fitfully whistling little snatches from "The&#xD;
Sleigh Bells," and preparing to go up to Craigenfells and spend:&#xD;
the morning with Bertha, and escort her down to the Sewing&#xD;
Society.&#xD;
" Good-morning, deacon," he called out rather irreverently.&#xD;
"Good-morning, sir," replied that dignitary, somewhat stiffly.&#xD;
Chandy's youth was as disagreeable to him as George's muscle.&#xD;
" Come .and sit down, deacon. T is is as pleasant a place as&#xD;
you will find of a warm morning, I'llengage. I think it 'is going&#xD;
to clear off, I thought I saw the sun lust now."&#xD;
"I cannot stop, sir. Idling may suit boys, but it won't do for&#xD;
men of my stamp. We don't look about for pleasant places, sir,&#xD;
we search for fulcrums, and we move the world, sir. Enterprise,&#xD;
and skill, and money, sir !"&#xD;
"Just so, deacon, and very neatly expressed ; but hold on.&#xD;
Did'nt I hear you speaking about my sister's Mephistopheles ?"&#xD;
" No, sir. I hav'nt mentioned any such article that I am aware,&#xD;
of," replied the deacon, feeling of his bald head.&#xD;
" But I heard you. You took on your lips the name of her&#xD;
Grimalkin, her familiar, her catus domesticus, yclept Rainbow."&#xD;
"Oh, you refer to the old tom-cat that has been killing Bax-&#xD;
ter's fowls. I was speaking to your worthy mother, as you may&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.      423&#xD;
&#xD;
say, about that rascally animal. He has been committing tres-&#xD;
pass, young man ; he is given up to justice, weighed in the bal-&#xD;
ances and found wanting, sir."&#xD;
a" Should'nt be at all surprised if hehad, deacon ; but there's a&#xD;
curious fact I'd like to mention to you. Rainbow has, as you so&#xD;
facetiously observed, nine lives-make it fifteen if you like. Now&#xD;
the :point is this: every one of his lives are so interwoven with&#xD;
may sister's comfort and pleasure, that I don't believe it would be&#xD;
healthy for anybody to meddle with him. Indeed, I shall take&#xD;
any such meddling as a personal affront to myself, and shall settle&#xD;
the account accordingly. If he vilely trespasseson your poultry-&#xD;
yard, just send the bill to' me."&#xD;
" Certainly, Chandos ; very right, very proper. You are a&#xD;
most 'worthy and promising young person. I have no doubt you&#xD;
will overcome your inertia sufficiently to make your mark some&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"I shall certainly leave my mark on anybody who meddles&#xD;
with my sister's pet. You can mention the fact to any one whom&#xD;
you think it will interest."&#xD;
" Gool--morning, Chandos."&#xD;
" But I say, deacon, how about Creampitcher ?"&#xD;
"I don't know anything about it, sir," said the deacon, edging&#xD;
off.&#xD;
" Come, deacon, sit down.' 'The day is ours, the bloody dog is&#xD;
dead. "&#xD;
The deacon glanced uneasily in search of the defunct animal,&#xD;
and answered-&#xD;
"'Impossible, sir; a vast amount of business, awaits me at the&#xD;
Gonecusset office."&#xD;
" Why, deacon, you remind me of 'the lawyer who urged his&#xD;
friend to take a pleasure trip with him. ' I can't,' said the friend ;&#xD;
'I shall lose a thousand dollars if I do.'. 'Oh well, Tom,' re-&#xD;
plied the lawyer, "what's the use;, you can't -take -it with you&#xD;

"Oh, I leave the application to your wisdom; but I say, just&#xD;

"Excuse me, Chandos ; I don't want to listen to such trash.&#xD;
What do you suppose I care about dog-fights? I never did.&#xD;
When I was a boy they used to tie tin kettles to their tails to see&#xD;
them run. I never could. I always felt for the dog."&#xD;
" Very virtuous indeed of you, deacon. Well, you see, Jan-&#xD;
Oh, you won't stop ! Well, bye-bye. I'm sure to be at your&#xD;
shin-dig this evening; we intend to give you a benefit."-&#xD;
After the deacon had walked away, with his tall hat set per-&#xD;
pendicularly on his head, and his toes  squared out, naughty.Chandy&#xD;
stuck his feet on to the table, and laughed for at least ten minutes.&#xD;
Mrs. Goldsmith performed a contortion, which she was in the&#xD;
habit of consideringa smile, as she shut the door on her visitor,&#xD;
and went -back to her churning.&#xD;
" Tight !" said she; "tight as the bark on a tree. I reckon&#xD;
I'll get something out of-him. I shall kill Creampitcher for a&#xD;
beef critter in the fall, any way."&#xD;
Chris slipped out and ran down the garden path and called&#xD;
"Rainbow." She proposed to- shut him into her room for the&#xD;
day; she could not bear to think of his being at Bax Williams'&#xD;
disposal.- Already had she taken her sleek four-footed friend into&#xD;
her confidence. The next morning after the horse-back party, he,&#xD;
came jumping and leaping upon her pillow ; he purred and licked&#xD;
her face, and patted it with his great double paw, carefullycur-&#xD;
tailed of claws, and she awakened- with a smile, and. drew him&#xD;
into her arms and kissed him.&#xD;
" Oh, Rainbow ! I'm the happiest girl! I've such a friend, so&#xD;
noble, so good, so clever; such a matchless gentleman,.Rainbow !&#xD;
and he loves me dearly ; he told me so, or I would never have&#xD;
&#xD;
dared to think it ; and I'm going to be married to hin," (this last&#xD;
in a whisper.)&#xD;
Rainbow disengaged himself from her imprisoning arms, sat&#xD;
down close to her, and washed his face all over; and she lay, her&#xD;
-cheek ii her hand, \looking at him, and thinking her pleasant&#xD;
thoughts, till her mother's shrill tones recalled her to the fact that&#xD;
she must wait a little longer before her real life should begin.&#xD;
She felt as if Rainbow shared her secret, which she had not&#xD;
told to anybody, and she loved him more than ever. She could&#xD;
,not open her heart to Chandy, kind as he was getting, his love of&#xD;
fun and teazing was too paramount for that.; and she would have&#xD;
as soon gone, out to the great gray rock in the garden, as to her&#xD;
mother, with her feelings, either of love or sorrow. So she. hugged&#xD;
Rainbow, and poured her hopes into his ears, for lack of a better&#xD;
friend, and truly a safer repository of a secret she could scarcely&#xD;
need.&#xD;
She found him now, curled up in his favorite bower under the&#xD;
tall asparagus-a perfect cat paradise, cool, quiet, and sheltered.&#xD;
He came out at her call, stretching and yawning, and in answer&#xD;
to her invitation he sprang to her shoulder, and curled his length&#xD;
around her neck, so as to leave his paws free to caress her face.&#xD;
Fearless, rollicking with good humor, his great tail waving in the&#xD;
soft air, like a benevolent serpent. She walked among therfour-&#xD;
o'-clocks, the pare-yellow squashes, the rank tomato vines, the&#xD;
sweet thyme and sage beds, plucking thoughtfully at the grape&#xD;
runners, and so on close to the garden fence, she heard voices-a&#xD;
loud, rasping laugh, and shrill,. childish tones, scolding and af-&#xD;
frighted.&#xD;
" You shan't ! I won't ! Go away, wicked, cruel boy ; I hate&#xD;
you ! Oh, Dick ! Peter ! Chris ! Somebody !"&#xD;
Chris parted the bushes and looked over in the angle ; she saw&#xD;
Pauline Bradshaw, as close as she 'could be to the fence, her&#xD;
great eyes extended, her hands thrown up, a picture of terror and&#xD;
courage, and cowering behind her, too frightened even to scream,&#xD;
little Gracie Jenkins, hei very lips colorless, while close in front&#xD;
of them, and holding them prisoners by his hateful bulk, stood&#xD;

Baxter Williams. A. small writhing snake was- twisting about&#xD;
his warty hand, clutched by the tail, and in its tortured gyrations&#xD;
it struck the children on their faces, arms, and necks with its cold&#xD;
slimy head, while he grinned. in intense enjoyment of their agony.&#xD;
Now if.Rainbow had a-weaknesA,;it was for killing.snakes; he&#xD;
bit them from head to tail, perhaps it was to preserve his teeth;&#xD;
I have heard of people doing it for ,that. Rainbow rose up and&#xD;
looked a moment, then made a noiseless leap .on to the fence,&#xD;
thence to Master Baxter's head, and running down his extended&#xD;
arm, as if it had been.a causeway, he seized the reptile and drop-&#xD;
ping lightly to the ground, he dashed away, leaving, the aston-&#xD;
ished boy, with.the ugly grin, on his unwashed countenance, and&#xD;
his empty fist extended. Chris laughed merrily in-her covert,&#xD;
and Baxter sought her with his eyes.&#xD;
"That's-.,a blamed mean, sneakin' cat of your'n, Christabel&#xD;
Goldsmith, and a'nasty thief to boot; and I'm a-goin' to kill him,&#xD;
fast chance. Pa says how't I may, and I will, whether or no."&#xD;
The two children had shot out from.their durance, as soon as&#xD;
their jailor turned around, and nowin safety, Pauline stopped to&#xD;
scold.&#xD;
" You shan't kill Rainbow !" she shouted. "I love him!"&#xD;
"You do ? good ! I'll just tell youwhat I'll do. I'll slit his&#xD;
ears, and chop off his tail, and take a gad and whale him, and&#xD;
then I'll tie him down and.stick him all over with pins, and then&#xD;
I'll hang him. Now then, missy, with your fine slippers and your&#xD;
lorn curls, what do you think of that ? And you can't help your.&#xD;
self, either ; loving the old tom cat won't keep it from hurting himl."&#xD;
"You are a wicked, cruel, speckled, warty boy, and I hate you.&#xD;
I wouldn't=be you for anything. .I should think you would be&#xD;
afraid to say your prayers, you are such a horrid wretch !" and&#xD;
Pauine burst into tears of rage and grief, seeing which,- Baxter&#xD;
performed a:hornpipe of.delight.&#xD;
" Good, good ! .that's bully ! I love to plague little girls and&#xD;
make-'em cry. It's better than, liquish."&#xD;
"-Come, Pauline, dear," said Chris, afraid to speak above% her-&#xD;
breath,.she was so angry. ",You children had better come inside&#xD;
&#xD;
the gate, and perhaps Baxter will be kind enoughto-goway.,I&#xD;
cannot think he will be so cruel as to: hurt poor Rainbow."&#xD;
"But I will, though; you'd better say poor chickens; the old&#xD;
beast's been a killin' of 'em; I found fifteen of 'em  dead this&#xD;
morning, worth half a dollar apiece. If I won't choke : your old&#xD;
tom cat for:you, you bet."&#xD;
" Fifteen!" said Chris. ." Why I heard your father .tamping to&#xD;
Chandos about it this morning, and I am positive he said one."&#xD;
ierdon't know;nothing about, my chickens, father don't. I&#xD;
only let 'em see one; there was fifteen, ,I swear there was:,I&#xD;
counted 'em."&#xD;
"I'm very sorry," said Chris;-"you ought not to lose. your&#xD;
chickens. If you are sure Rainbow did the mischief, though I&#xD;
can hardly believe it, he never touches my poultry, but if you&#xD;
are sure, I'll do my best to make the loss up to you. I've a brood&#xD;
of black Polands just come off, there are ten of them, you may&#xD;
take them if you like, and I hope you won't hurt Rainbow," she&#xD;
added, trying to get comfort from the unpromising face before her.&#xD;
She sighed at the sacrifice. she was about to make to her sense&#xD;
" of justice, for she had been up at day-dawn admiring her chick-&#xD;
ens; she intended them as a parting gift to Ruth Blair, who doted&#xD;
upon fancy fowls.&#xD;
Baxter drew his-coat sleeve across his face to hide a grin.&#xD;
" Well, I don't know as it'll pay, but I'll take 'em; as like as&#xD;
not they'll all die, but I'll take 'em."&#xD;
Chris and the children went to the hen-house and gathered&#xD;
up the cunning little balls, and took their purple-black mother&#xD;
out of her coop, and Bax lost no time in getting away with his&#xD;
booty. When he had gone a piece up the street, he set down the&#xD;
basket and looked in and counted.&#xD;
'Golly, if that ain't about the jolliest go as I ever heard tell&#xD;
on. Sold, the whole kaboodle on 'em, pa and all, and got a hen&#xD;
and chickens for it. Oh, crackey ! I'd let Steve's dog tackle&#xD;
another rooster, if I could make it pay like. this."&#xD;
After all, I don't know as Master Baxter was so very much to&#xD;
blame for his lax notions about honesty ; he was continually get=&#xD;

He had one the week previous to this affair, which still possessed&#xD;
his mind. He was sent to Toptown in the car, and when the&#xD;
conductor came along for fares he offered a half-ticket. The man&#xD;
looked at Iim doubtfully, and inquired his age. "I'm under&#xD;

"You'r -ather a large boy for your age," he took the half-ticket,&#xD;
and passed on. Then Bax took off his hat and chuckled, and&#xD;
admired a great 11 which he had pinned into the crown. He&#xD;
related the occurrence at home, and lis father laughed as at a&#xD;

CHAPTER TWE,NTY-SEVENTH.&#xD;
A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS-NO INSURANCE IN THE TRAVELERS.&#xD;
THE Deacon, who kept a sharp oversight of all the business&#xD;
of his company, looked into their variety store, after his parting&#xD;
with Chandos.&#xD;
There was a great deal of grumbling among the employees,&#xD;
who were forced to be purchasers at this store, and get cheap ar-&#xD;
ticles at dear rate, or lose their chance of employment; and&#xD;
they were talking up a co-operative, which made the Deacon&#xD;
squirm every time he heard of it, though Captain Slocum said it&#xD;
was a capital plan: " Each one for themselves," he added, "let&#xD;
heir quilt." But the , Deacon didn't approve the pattern of the&#xD;
quilting, and showed his spite against George Blair, who was for-&#xD;
ward in the enterprise, in divers little ways.&#xD;
The worthy church pillar stood by with the air of a connoiseur&#xD;
while the clerk tried to sell a chest of tea at a bargain, and when&#xD;
he succeeded, and the purchaser carried off his prize in huge&#xD;
satisfaction, the Deacon rubbed his hands and said nasally:&#xD;
"Well, boys, I must say youdone fust rate with that-are tea;&#xD;
it wasn't wuth a red cent, seemingly, as you may say ; I expected&#xD;
we should have to lose the whole batch of it; after the old cat kep&#xD;
her kittens in it; I didn't know as they was there till they got&#xD;
their eyes open. You didn't ought to be so careless, boys; it&#xD;
isn't discharging your duty to your employers. There, Jason,&#xD;
how manytimes must I tell you not to fetch them there cloths up&#xD;
close to that winder, and bring out all the spots. If folks are a&#xD;
mind to take it up themselves, all right;:if they buy it where it&#xD;
is, it is their look out, not ours; they can read the card, no goods&#xD;

exchanged. You'll never move the lever that moves the world&#xD;
unless you learn to take advantage of all the' chances."&#xD;
The Deacon- pulled on his gloves ; he paused with a grieved&#xD;
countenance ;n the grocery department.&#xD;
"Timothy," said he, sadly, "I'm afraid you haven't measured&#xD;
them eggs. I know you have'nt."&#xD;
.      He tookdu one aid, placed itupon a.neat conitrivancChe prid.-&#xD;
ed himself upon inventing. It was a wooden frame with holes in&#xD;
it placed 'over a' pan -of saw-dust- the:- eggs which refused to go&#xD;
through the larger orifice were for his family use; those which&#xD;
took' the plunge, he had privately instructed Tim to -set aside for&#xD;
the other~Gonecussets, and those, which slipped through the little&#xD;
hole, for general retail. That young villain thrust- his tongue-&#xD;
into his cheek, and winked at Jason while he put the embryo&#xD;
chickens through their paces.&#xD;
"If anybody comes to; see me, Timothy, tell 'em I'm gone to&#xD;
eleven o'clock prayer-meeting ; in the path of dooty, as you may&#xD;
say;seeningly'; we are pilgrims, we' seek' a city."&#xD;
"Go'ahead, old 'stick-in-the-mud, and you'll find one with a&#xD;
brimstone lake in' the middle on't," said Tim, after the door closed&#xD;
on' his 'superior.&#xD;
Arrived at the lecture-room, where Mr. Growing was awaiting&#xD;
him' with' plans for' the- new church edifice, and looking, pgor&#xD;
man, very pal.e and tired; the Deacon entered with zeal into&#xD;
the-young pastor's ideas, and' headed. the subscription list with a&#xD;
handsome sum, and said,' rubbing- his hands, with' precisely the&#xD;
same 'gesture he had -used in admonishing his clerks:&#xD;
"Now, brother Growing, let's have a little season of prayer,"&#xD;
and he was' affected to tears in his contrite confessions, and seemed&#xD;
all 'broken down under a sense of his' unworthiness, and earnest&#xD;
in begging for grace and help. He used such plenty of Scripture;&#xD;
quotations -as showed his constant' study of the sacred writings,&#xD;
though he perverted their, meaning occasionally, and might very&#xD;
likely have realized Tim's prophecy, if he had' got literal answers&#xD;
to his 'requests." "Oh jLord; let' the Prince of the 'power of the&#xD;
air'come doWn and reign," prayed: he;"though he had no wish tq&#xD;

raise the devil. "Let us trust Thee where we cannot trace Thee,"&#xD;
was a part'of all his prayer, which often-recurred to Mr. Grow-"&#xD;
ing's mind, and that earnest young laborer smiled in spite of him-&#xD;
self, when his zealous co-worker ended his morning prayer with&#xD;
this naive admission: " Oh Lord, we're so wicked we 'don't know&#xD;
as you'll hear us, and we:e'en amost hope you won't," after ,hich'&#xD;
he blew his nose, wiped his eyes, and took an affectionate 'leav&amp;amp;&#xD;
of the minister.&#xD;
The preceding Thursday evening 'he had found this remarkable&#xD;
passage in his Bible, which he read to' the brothers and' sisters:&#xD;
"And Satan went out from  the presence of the Lord and- shot&#xD;
Job with four balls;" now he6left the holy 'place and dived head&#xD;
and ears into the schemes and labors of the Gonecnssets.&#xD;
Thursday was Mrs. Goldsmith's- cleaning day, and iChandos'&#xD;
being out'-of the way, Chris was kept at it, sweeping and dusting;&#xD;
poking into all the corners, and pulling out things on purpose to&#xD;
put them up again, and when dinner was over, and the dishes&#xD;
washed, what with the heat-and the' hard work,' the poor child felt&#xD;
very weary. As she went 'slowly up stairs, dragging her aching'&#xD;
feet after her, the widow called sharply:&#xD;
" I s'pose .I shajl have to trust you to lock up to-day; I don t&#xD;
see why you need promise to wait for 'Bert7y Groenveldt."&#xD;
-I :didnot promise, mother; Chandy arranged it to'suit him-&#xD;
self, and ordered me to stop. He is to drive Bertha in from"&#xD;
Craigenfells ; I 'am sure it is not material to me, I'd just as soon&#xD;
stay at home enti ely."&#xD;
"I dare say, just like your shiftlessness; never keep up to any&#xD;
plan of usefulness ! but you won't stay, and=do you be ready'to&#xD;
start the instant minute they land here ; I'rm a great mind to lock&#xD;
up and tale you along now."&#xD;
"As you please," answered Chris, indifferently. -She knew 'her&#xD;
mother would not dare .to fasten Chandy out.&#xD;
" When did my' son say he should be here ?"&#xD;
" He said three o'clock, mother; but you know-'Chandy is not&#xD;
very punctual,.and it isquite as likely'fto be four as thi-ee."&#xD;
Go along:and cleap yourself up do, and'not-stick 'jabberin&#xD;

on that stair and hindering me ; so inconsiderate, allers talking at&#xD;
the wrong time," said the widow tartly, displeased that Chris&#xD;
should remark upon her darling son.&#xD;
Chris shut her door, and put up her hair very smoothly, (she&#xD;
was going to be extremely nice and particular that day,) then she&#xD;
took down her black satin dress and got out her thimble and silk-&#xD;
to mend a zig-zag tear in the'skirt. Just as she was about to&#xD;
commence, her eye fell upon "Die Donanlander," and she took it&#xD;
up just for one little minutes to rest herself. Three o'clock struck&#xD;
and she had not stirred a muscle. A merry voice calling up the&#xD;
stair-case made her jump, and wake up to the fact that the time&#xD;
had all flown, and her dress still lay on the floor, the zig-zag tear&#xD;
grinning in her face ; and Chandos and Bertha were waiting for&#xD;
her below. So with too easy recourse to her old "never mind"&#xD;
-  habits, she put on the dress, pinning up the place, hoping it might&#xD;
escape notice. She comforted herself that nobody minded about&#xD;
her. Otho was away. She had seen him but once since the horse-&#xD;
back party, when he had pointed her pencil for the Soyez lecture&#xD;
.and only lingered to say good-bye. She fervently hoped that&#xD;
madame would find Craigenfells too pleasant to leave, and that&#xD;
everybody would sedulously attend to their own business, and let-&#xD;
her slide into some obscure corner. She tied on the white apron,&#xD;
Ruth's ,gift, and which she had never worn since that dear day up&#xD;
at Uncle Alec's, patting it for the sweet memories it gave her, and&#xD;
smiling at it, and down she wasted, already oblivious of the zig-&#xD;
zag, such things so easily slid back among the trifles in her esti-&#xD;
mation.&#xD;
Chandy and Bertha seemed not in the least haste to set out,&#xD;
but Chris knew well what manner of scolding she would get if&#xD;
they delayed their appearance.&#xD;
"Do hurry, Chandy, if you love me."&#xD;
"iListen ! this castle hath a pleasant seat. The air nimbly and&#xD;
sweetly recommends itself unto our gentle senses. Nevertheless,&#xD;
I come, Grimalkin."&#xD;
"Don't encourage this brother of mine to call me names, I en-&#xD;
treat," said Chris, glancing in at the library door, and dropping a&#xD;
curtesy to the bust on its pedestal.&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.              433&#xD;
"Stay Chris, one thing is sure. I can't. stand this old satin&#xD;
horror, much longer.  This inky cloak-thy customary dud of&#xD;
solemn black, thy trapping and thy suit of woe.' I shall be&#xD;
constrained to take this dress business into my own hands if mother&#xD;
does, not rise and show herelf equal to her times."&#xD;
"Don't speak of it, Chanclos."  Chris sidled carefully around,&#xD;
so as to keep the whole side of her skirt next him. " Please be&#xD;
quiet. Now that I am  really certain of going to school, I had&#xD;
rather wait, and have all my things fresh and new, and I will&#xD;
start fair, and see what I can do; besides all you could say would&#xD;
be useless. Mother is more than usually set. I'm to wear my&#xD;
old things till I go."&#xD;
" I'm not certain of that. I generally intend to make it of use&#xD;
if I take a matter up.&#xD;
" Please don't, Chandy. I hate to be a bone for you two to.&#xD;
quarrel over, and I am so happy. I don't mind my looks. I only&#xD;
wish you would'nt make such a coil about them, dress seems to&#xD;
me of such very minor consequence.&#xD;
." A most fatal error, Chris. Bertha does not so regard her&#xD;
adornings," he bowed flatteringly to that young lady, who was ex-&#xD;
ceedingly dainty in a suit of delicate buff. "But Chris, you do&#xD;
look happy, that's patent. The prospect of going to. school has&#xD;
made you radiant. Kindled a fire in your eyes. I was observ-&#xD;
ing you, yesterday. You step as if about to dance, and carry&#xD;
your head like a Juno."&#xD;
Chris turned away from her, brother, who was studying her,'&#xD;
as if she had been a. statue, with a conscious blush, and .aid&#xD;
hurriedly:&#xD;
" Come Bertha,let's go, this brother of mine is getting personal."&#xD;
"Well, I suppose I must," said Bertha, rising slowly, "ibut it is&#xD;
,e cool and pleasant here. I hate to go away."&#xD;
" You and I need not go, unless we choose, we'll tarry by the&#xD;
stuff."&#xD;
"Indeed you will not. You'll go, and directly too," said Chris,&#xD;
decidedly."&#xD;
' Well, I like- that ! ordering a fellow about.'' Chandy got&#xD;

lazily to his feet. " Needs must, I suppose, when somebody&#xD;
drives."&#xD;
Chris pushed them out before her, locked the street door, and&#xD;
hung the great key upon her forefinger, which reminded her of&#xD;
Nancy, and she immediately lost her own identity, and missed the&#xD;
funny interchange of light talk between her companions, in follow-&#xD;
ing that hapless wretch's dreary road till she saw- her a bruised&#xD;
and bleeding corpse in the lonely garret : and then Sonsie's kiss&#xD;
upon her hand recalled her to Roaring River.&#xD;
The Sewing Society had materially changed in character since&#xD;
we had the pleasure of meeting the Millville ladies at Mrs. Blair's.&#xD;
The gatherings were now quite like full dress parties. Follow-&#xD;
ing Miss Erandon's lead, who was an oi-acle among them, the&#xD;
young spinsters wore their best, and- copied her style, and got&#xD;
patronized or snubbed, as she happened to find convenient. Even&#xD;
the 1Roaring River girls, Zoe, Sabrina, and the rest, were glad of&#xD;
the opportunty to come out, as Chandy said, "in rings, gawds,&#xD;
and conceits,"  To do Belle justice, she did not shirk the labor,&#xD;
and kept Mary Ann up to it also, indefatigably, cutting out and&#xD;
putting together fancy articles, intending as a recompense of re-&#xD;
ward to preside at the Fair, the appointed time for which was&#xD;
fast approaching.&#xD;
Ioor Dame Williams had been in a state of fermentation all&#xD;
the morning, what between her intense desire for display and&#xD;
her dread that her handsome carpets might get injured. The&#xD;
:day having settled down after twelve o'clock into a drizzle and&#xD;
sizzle of the first water, Sometimes she thought she would shut&#xD;
up her drawing rooms and confine the ladies to the back part of&#xD;
the house, but as she had not invited any company since she had&#xD;
hung her lace curtains, the longing to show them got the better&#xD;
of every other consideration, aided by some artful suggestions&#xD;
from Belle, who looked black enough, while economy seemed&#xD;
likely to carry the day.&#xD;
" It will do for a party, dear Auntie Willias ;" (she always&#xD;
called her Auntie, when she wanted to wheedle her,) and it won't&#xD;
cost' halfso much, and: our syveet, darling Mary An  can wear&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMIITII'S DAUGHTER.            43&#xD;
her new silk, and she is so pretty in it.. Do you know I was so&#xD;
proud of her, the other day. 'I really think I love her as much&#xD;
as if she were my sister by blood as well as adoption. I am sure&#xD;
Mr. Brown is quite of my opinion, he will be here this evening&#xD;
of course ; he's a' very aristocratic fellow. I hope he and Mr.&#xD;
Hauxhurst will not come to coffee and pistols about Millithy&#xD;
Nillithy. Such a belle as the dear child is getting. I always do&#xD;
my best to show her off, and it takes tact to manage those things.&#xD;
I flatter myself that 'I am. moderately supplied with that society&#xD;
coin. The Roaring River girls are beginning to take to her, and&#xD;
I intend she shall lead them all before I go. I don't know how&#xD;
I can ever go, Auntie. I am so happy wi h you all."  She put up&#xD;
her handkerchief, and quite overcome by her tender emotion, she&#xD;
sobbed gracefully. Having given Mrs. Williams plenty of time&#xD;
to say she could not part with her, and hearing nothing to that ef-&#xD;
feet, she wiped her eyes. " I shall always come to you when I&#xD;
please, shall I not,? this is one of my homes, Auntie."&#xD;
"Idare say," replied the matron shortly. Belle's hints about&#xD;
getting Mary Ann off had taken effect, and her mind was now&#xD;
screwed into her preparations.&#xD;
"Oh my more than mother, how I love you."   Belle floated&#xD;
gushingly up to. her in an attitude she had been practising before&#xD;
her mirror; and kissed her ripe cheek in a kind of dutiful rapture.&#xD;
You marvel, here,. Sonsie,' said Mrs. Williams, getting rid'of&#xD;
her artless adopted rather abruptly. " I shall hef to let em in I&#xD;
do spouse, but you mind and have the house-cloth ready and wipe&#xD;
up every speck of dirt, and if any of em wears their rubbers in,&#xD;
do you put em right out again immediately. I'll keep out all the,&#xD;
nastiness I can, if I do let em on to mycarpets."&#xD;
The preparations got stormier and stormier, as they progressed.&#xD;
Sonsie told Bridget she thought the mistress got out of bed-wrong&#xD;
end first, to which Bridget growled a reply.,-&#xD;
" Sorra a bit of a right end has she got at all at all. She's&#xD;
breaking the heart of me all the day wid her crossing and rack-.&#xD;

" How many have you there to bring, and have the whole wid&#xD;
ye ?"&#xD;
"Its five half sisters that I have, Sonsie, me girl, and thank ye&#xD;
kindly for enquirin, but I've never a whole one at all."&#xD;
Mrs. Williams pricked up her ears, but could not catch the rin&#xD;
of the conversation, she being in the pantry, mixing her crullers.-&#xD;
She pointed her nose toward the fire place and snuffed energeti-&#xD;
cally..&#xD;
" You stop your gabbling, you Sonsie, and mind your spoons.&#xD;
That fat's burning. Don't you know enough to run it off the&#xD;
coals. Do step Bridget ! hef to take range by sunthing to see&#xD;
you move. I should think your legs was made of lead.",&#xD;
" Like Nebucudnizzers image," put in Sonsie parenthetically,&#xD;
polishing her silver for dear life.&#xD;
"I've a notion I shall some time or another show you the -stuff&#xD;
me futs is made of," growled Bridget without stirring from' her&#xD;
station at the sink.'&#xD;
" Don't you hear me, you Irish huzzey," roared the Dame.&#xD;
"Ohr yes, I hear, me ears is the ones for hearin."  Bridget&#xD;
winked at Sonsie, who laughed among her spoons.&#xD;
"Are you agoin to stir ?"&#xD;
"As soons as I getsready, I'll stir lively, and I'll never budge&#xD;
an inch before."-&#xD;
"rWhen you get ready !" screamed Mrs. Williams, taking her&#xD;
hands from the'dough, and glowering on her cook in astonishment.&#xD;
"Yes honey, sure enough, them's me words,when Igets ready."&#xD;
" Well, Bridget Malone, there's one thing-you'll do before you&#xD;
get ready. Take your paws out of that dish-water and leave !&#xD;
march !.trot ! out with you, pick up your feet lively."&#xD;
"cYes manam, I give you warning. I'm engaged with Mrs.&#xD;
Bisbee, ma'am. She's been begging of ie this ever so lrig..&#xD;
It's thrue enough for t'auld dragon, Sonsie," she whispered; see-&#xD;
ing the girls eyes fixed upon her. " I wish you a good day ma'am,&#xD;
and a great deal of happiness, wid ye's cookin and scrubbing; and&#xD;

may the divil heat up his brimstone and fetch' ye away for the&#xD;
very first bilin, .and my blessin go wid ye. Sonsie, I'll be gettin&#xD;
ye a place. Yon murtherin old witch is ,not the mistress for the&#xD;
likely girl ; you'll come right away out of this. The blackguards&#xD;
of children will be spoilin afl the-swate ways of ye."&#xD;
Bridget pounded up stairs, and in a few minutes she pounded&#xD;
down again, firing off a few aggravating remarks as she banged&#xD;
the -door, and she passed the windows laughing and tossing her&#xD;
head in a high state of enjoyment. Long before noon the Dame&#xD;
repented of her ebullition of temper. She got crosser and crosser&#xD;
every moment. Mary Ann was called to the rescue, and poor&#xD;
Sonsie had to bend to the work with double diligence and vigor,&#xD;
but her ears ached with the scolding, and her willing little feet&#xD;
could not run fast enough to please her task-mistress.&#xD;
"Have hot water for them plates," ordered the sharp voice in&#xD;
command.&#xD;
" It is, hot as blazes, ma'am, it scalds the hands off me."&#xD;
" No such thing, you little shirk. It ain't blood-warm, don't&#xD;
even smoke."&#xD;
" Try it yourself then, if it's the hate of your blood that ye call&#xD;
it, mine does not run boilin," said Sonsie, blowing her red fingers.&#xD;
"I will then," screamed Mrs. Williams, " Beast of a Paddy,"&#xD;
she seized the girl's hands in her great powerful fists, and thrust&#xD;
them down in the nearly boiling water, and held them there.&#xD;
"Now then, sass me again will you."&#xD;
Sonsie gave a sharp cry of agony, and struggled hard to free her&#xD;
arms from the. powerful grip which held them. Splashing and&#xD;
dashing, she flirted some of the liquid torment into the Dame's&#xD;
eye, which caused her to let loose in a hurry, and apply her apron&#xD;
to the suffering member, while sheaimed a smart blow at Sonsie's&#xD;
head, and missed it, being nearly blinded, 'and hitting with less&#xD;
than her usual precision.&#xD;
Sonsie had borne plenty of sharp - words, as well as sundry&#xD;
raps and pinches, which she good naturedly set down as part of&#xD;
her teaching, and so highly did she appreciate the thorough per-&#xD;
fection of The Danme's, inethod, that they all went for .nothing ;&#xD;

now she set her teeth, and uttered no Word of remonstrance or&#xD;
complaint, but flew to the water pail, and plungea her hands and&#xD;
half parboiled arms in, up to the elbows.&#xD;
"Oh mother, how could you !" exclaimed Mary Ann, her chalky&#xD;
face turning brick color, her fears of her mother succumbing to&#xD;
her indignation, "how .could you be so cruel."  She weptaloud&#xD;
like a child, and made queer faces over her sorrow. Belle Bran--&#xD;
don was standing by the ironing table smoothing out a dress, and&#xD;
she turned around with the iron in her hand, and a look of disgust,&#xD;
in her face ; she could play with feelings and mince hearts, but,&#xD;
physical cruelty was abhorrent to her.&#xD;
" Upon my word, Auntie, you ought to go South and have a&#xD;
plantation. What a mistress you would be. I heard about one&#xD;
who chained her cook eight feet from the fire place, and another&#xD;
who had a pleasant way of smoothing out her servants- with hot&#xD;
flat irons. You would invent something new, I'm sure. You are&#xD;
such a nice manager. I'm going to study your method. 'Look at&#xD;
the blisters on the-girl's fingers."&#xD;
"Let me put some butter on your hands," said Mary Ann, hur-&#xD;
riedly. "Don't tell anybody, Sonsie. - I hope she did'nt know&#xD;
how hot the water was, I'm sure she could'nt. I'll show you that&#xD;
Princess stitch you wanted to learn."  All this Mary Ann whis-&#xD;
pered with her head close to Sonsie's, and her back to her&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
"Oh' it don't smart much, Miss Mary," spoke up the sufferer&#xD;
cheerfully, her heart warming at the first kind word. "I can bear&#xD;
it well enough."&#xD;
".That dish water want so drefful hot," said the dame, dipping&#xD;
her finger into it, and pulling it out again in a hurry.&#xD;
Belle laughed as long as she thought her hostess would bear it,&#xD;
and made some rather irreverent remarks abott getting accus-&#xD;
tomed gradually to a higher temperature, and then applied the&#xD;
oil of flattery to her rumpled feathers, and helped her finish up odds&#xD;
and ends of preparation, in such fine style, as proved how capable&#xD;
and efficent'she could be.&#xD;
Mrs. Goldsmith was among the earliest arrivals. Prim and&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER:              439&#xD;
methodical, she filled the office of first directress with praise-&#xD;
worthy care and exactitude. Precisely as two hours told them-&#xD;
selves off from the shining gilded clock on the top of which re-&#xD;
clined two yellow girls in painfully lounging attitudes, (a center&#xD;
ornament'of Mrs. Williams' highly carved mantel,) she seated her-&#xD;
self in her chair of office. Stiff and rigid, with spectacles on&#xD;
nose, she examined the articles finished since last society. The&#xD;
members had formed a habit of taking home a piece of sewing to&#xD;
accomplish in the interim between the meetings, at Belle Bran-&#xD;
don's suggestion, who wished to bowl them along at top speed so&#xD;
as to reach the Fair, where she proposed to shine a bright partic-&#xD;
ular star. There was the usual amount of ripping out and doing&#xD;
over, and this afforded Mrs. Goldsmith the highest gratification&#xD;
'of which she was capable. Having smoothed, out a faint wrinkle&#xD;
from her best bomibazine; and fastened her scissors to her side by&#xD;
a cord, and sent them down with a run, condemned" to dangle,&#xD;
"till dead,, dead, dead," she laid out her needle-book, emery-&#xD;
bag, and thimble, glowering at each, daring it. to run away, and&#xD;
took up the .finished articles, one by one, and twitched the gath-&#xD;
ers, glared at the button-holes, plucked at the buttons and pried&#xD;
open the seams, for some time without finding what she sought,&#xD;
viz: some defect which should be legitimate subject for holy hor-&#xD;
ror. At last her diligence was rewarded. A sleeve in wrong&#xD;
side out.&#xD;
" The lands sakes ! who done this ?  This sleeve t'other side&#xD;
to. What a piece of work."  She held it up and glanced tri-&#xD;
umphantly around the room.&#xD;
." Christabel Goldsmith, is this shifless performance yours.?"&#xD;
She brought the fierce glitter of her black orbs to bear upon' her&#xD;
dreaming daughter. Seen through her spectacles they shone like&#xD;
the eight thousand lenses the hairy spider has at command, and&#xD;
had a wondrous effect,, for Chris started to-her feet as if hit by a&#xD;
missile.&#xD;
"I am afraid it is, mother," she said faintly. She had found&#xD;
out her mistake too late, and meant to do it over 'before it was&#xD;
&#xD;

discovered, but had entirely forgotten it. _ All the ladies stopped&#xD;
talking and fastened their eyes upon the young culprit.&#xD;
"What ever possessed you to stitch with such nasty thread?&#xD;
I'm ashamed of you !'&#xD;
"It kept breaking, mother, (it was some of a lot they had pur-&#xD;
chased at the Gonecusset store, a great bargain,) and my hands&#xD;
perspired so much," faltered poor Chris.&#xD;
" Come here this instant minute ! I've took pains enough with&#xD;
you,,toiling and learning of you early and late. You take that&#xD;
to bits abeaut as quick as you can set your fingers a-goin."&#xD;
Chris walked awkwardly across the room, every nerve quivering&#xD;
with shame and mortification as she drew near ; hpr mother, eye-&#xD;
ing her over, espied the frayed edges of the pinned-up tear in her&#xD;
satin skirt.&#xD;
"How'd you do that?"&#xD;
"I caught it on the rose-bush," replied Chris, speaking low.&#xD;
"Why upon airth did'nt you mend it before you come here to&#xD;
disgrace me before folks. I've a great mind to catch holt and&#xD;
lift it up and let everybody see it."&#xD;
Chris moved nimbly out of arms-length. She knew her mother&#xD;
was capable of such an exhibition of her faults, and would call it&#xD;
proper discipline.S&#xD;
"Don't, mother, please. I meant to do it indeed; but I was&#xD;
so busy all the morning, and when I got through the work I was&#xD;
tired and' sat down to rest a moment, and I sat too long. I'm&#xD;
sorry."   .&#xD;
"Humph ! sorry!  A nasty, triflin, shiftless creatur. You&#xD;
won't never be good for nothing in this world nor the next another,&#xD;
I don'tibelieve. There! do go along out of my sight. I've a&#xD;
great mind to send you home now, before supper. [Chris' bright-.&#xD;
ening face under this sentence made her change her mind.]  Set&#xD;
down somewhers, do, and go to work. I do wonder 'what I've&#xD;
done' that I must have such a trial sent onto me. You wear the&#xD;
:flesh off of my bones."&#xD;
Chris received the garment which her mother tossed, at her,&#xD;
and walked back to her place in a kind of dull maze. She felt&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSiMITH'S DAUGHTER.            441&#xD;
sure that everybody had heard the mild reproof, and must despise&#xD;
her. She was hot and colg and faint, and then indifferent, and&#xD;
just thought how she should like to drop away out of sight and&#xD;
mind, and bent her head over her work, and ripped- away with&#xD;
m chanical diligence.&#xD;
Adeliza Euphetnia-Hitchcock, who still resented Chris' digni-&#xD;
fied conduct at the Soyez lecture, where she had come off only&#xD;
second best, Adeliza Euphemia, dear girl! tittered and bridled,&#xD;
and exchanged a meaning look with the maternal Hitchcock, and&#xD;
said-&#xD;
"Did you ever, ma. Oh, forlornity !"&#xD;
(Zoe, indignantly, to Sabrina,)-" Why don't she see to the&#xD;
poor child's clothes herself ? My mother takes care of mine, and&#xD;
I am older than she is. Howy I should like to rise up and call&#xD;
her blessed ! Do look at her ! Is'nt she a nice looking article to&#xD;
call 'Mama?' Ah, the very thought makes me chilly."&#xD;
" Chris, dearest," said Bertha, who was sitting next her friend,&#xD;
(that is, next the shell into which she had withdrawn herself,) as&#xD;
,soon as the talk and scandal had recovered its pristine glow,&#xD;
i Chris, dearest, come up into Belle's room and let me mend that&#xD;
place for you before the.gentlemen come."&#xD;
"No thank you," answered Chris .coldly, and somewhat un-&#xD;
graciously. " I shall wear it as it is. Mother is right. I deserve&#xD;
to be scolded. If I am very much"mortified, perhaps I shall re-&#xD;
member."&#xD;
a Why," said Bertha, hesitating and blushing, "why did you&#xD;
not let me darn it before we came here ?  Half-an-hour could&#xD;
have made no difference, and I should have been ever so glad."&#xD;
"You mean why did I not do it. Well, I'll tell you, Miss&#xD;
Groenveldt-(flashing out of her apathy)-I swept, and scrubbed,&#xD;
and cleaned, from five o'clock this morning till dinner time, and&#xD;
then wickedly allowed myself to take, up a book, and so forgot&#xD;
that I must darn my only dress in order to be decent. You know&#xD;
all about me, Bertha; you know what a choice wardrobe I have ;&#xD;
but perhaps you don't know that Mrs.^Frederic Goldsmith's name&#xD;

feet but those rags. I hav: mended those, (she thrust out her&#xD;
worn Old rusty gaite'.)  There are tome slaves would like to&#xD;
get free,:besides those who go to Liberia, and I'm wrong to say,&#xD;
it, for, God willing, I'll soon turn my back on, my father's house,,&#xD;
thanks to dear Chandy. But I really ought to have several pairs&#xD;
of hands to be equal to all that is put upon me, and a saint's&#xD;
temper, which you see I have not-got."&#xD;
" But," said Bertha hesitatingly, (she was a little afraid of&#xD;
Chris, whose state of mind seemed to her somewhat chaotic,) and&#xD;
she laid her soft little hand with a light caress upon her own.&#xD;
"But what will     somebody.say if he sees you thus ?"&#xD;
"Whom do you mean ?"    A deep blush dyed Chris' face, and&#xD;
she moved uneasily, and pushed the tear out of sight.&#xD;
" Why, Chandos, of course !" replied Bertha, coloring in her&#xD;
turn..&#xD;
"Oh!" said Chris,.tossing her head. "He will bring out the&#xD;
most cutting thing he can find in his Billy Shakes, and I shall be&#xD;
very angry and fly out at him, and then I shall go afterwards and&#xD;
tell him I was wrong and he was right, and beg his pardon, and&#xD;
we shall be good friends again. Very likely I shall do you that&#xD;
way, too ; but, don't trouble yourself about me now, Bertha, I'm&#xD;
too stupid to be interesting. There comes Adeliza Euphemia;&#xD;
pray let nee escape her dry cackle, and lose myself in Die Don-,&#xD;
anlander, where I was wandering when. your voice recalled me this&#xD;
afternoon, and I'l try to forget all this clatter and chatter and,&#xD;
my own wickedness. Everything is gay and joyous. there.--&#xD;
Don't look so at me, dear. I'm not worth your trouble."&#xD;
She moved away into another corner, and laid down her vex-&#xD;
ations and took up her thoughts again.&#xD;
Mrs. Williams' rooms were filled, as she said, "chock full," in&#xD;
spite of the' weather, and as night "drew her sober curtains&#xD;
round," she began to calculate upon the probability of having to&#xD;
butter more biscuits and get out more crullers. She- counted&#xD;
noses, and allowed a cruller to each, and devoutly thanked her&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.              44&#xD;
stars that the young men could not get in early ; and she went&#xD;
out and bade Sonsie hurry up the tea kettle.&#xD;
"Put under a lot of shavins, and we'll have supper before any&#xD;
of them -men-folks get here. As like as not some of 'en 'll be pok-&#xD;
ing along because their wives is here; jes like 'em."&#xD;
She had decided, as the best possible means of saving her eat-&#xD;
ables and at the same time of being elegant, to send around her&#xD;
tea. Though since the faux pas at Ruth Blair's, when poor&#xD;
Chris had so wretchedly. come to grief, theladies had mostly set&#xD;
the supper upon a table, and expected the members to stand about&#xD;
and help themselves. This did not suit Mrs. Willianis' desire to&#xD;
mingle economyand display ; therefore she sent upon a silver&#xD;
salver china plates, containing as many slices of bread-and-butter&#xD;
as there were ladies, and two over, as she said, for "manners,"&#xD;
cut as thin as could be, and laid over with a scarcely perceptible&#xD;
scraping of butter. The cups and plates were of the finest, and&#xD;
the bread just sufficient to whet the appetites, and they looked&#xD;
out a little anxiously for more, but more there none did come, and&#xD;
they stirred the tea in their handsome cups, and sipped at their&#xD;
leisure. After a while the crullers appeared, of a size to suit the&#xD;
bread, and then Sonsie gathered up the empty dishes, and all was&#xD;
over.&#xD;
"I shall have to storm the pantry when I get home," said Zoe&#xD;
to Sabrina. " I never was so hungry in my life. Suppose you&#xD;
go up, like Oliver, and ask for more. I only wish Chandy was&#xD;
here-; I'd like to see her put him off with such a supper as this !"&#xD;
" Oh yes;. Chandos has impudence enough for anything. Do&#xD;
you remember the time when we children all went out to Deacon&#xD;
Proddy's to tea, and they had the strawberries set on in a saucer&#xD;
near Chandy, and he drew them in and ate the whole."&#xD;
"Oh yes ; and the family peas were on in a bowl, and I hope&#xD;
he devoured all those also. He said he supposed they were in-&#xD;
tended for him when.we laughed at him afterwards; but I doubt&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Of course he did," said Sabrina; "and very natural, too, I'm&#xD;
sure."&#xD;

Bertha, who had colored up and looked unnecessarily indignant,&#xD;
thought Sabrina -Bradshaw a truly noble girl-so'wise and so&#xD;
just.&#xD;
"We've got to have moire crullers," said Sonsie, her eyes danc-&#xD;
ing. ," There's not enough to go round; old Miss Pettengill took&#xD;
two, and Mrs. Hitchcock has not had any, and she told me to&#xD;
bring her some."&#xD;
" You let me catch you at it ! I did'nt make .cackleations for&#xD;
five hundred. Old Miss Pettengill is a greedy old critter, allus&#xD;
was. Go back and get out the rest of my chany, and mind you&#xD;
don't nick 'em."&#xD;
Mrs. Williams had delivered strict orders to her olives that&#xD;
they were all to keep at a "respectable distance" from the par-&#xD;
lors. She never permitted them to enter those sacred precincts.&#xD;
Her domestic rule was, as we know, very little moral suasion,&#xD;
combined with much use of the raw-hide, and they always diso-&#xD;
beyed or evaded her commands on every opportunity. They&#xD;
had been on the watch, skirmishing about the doors, jumping up&#xD;
and peeping in at the windows, and indulging in little :yells and&#xD;
chuckles all the afternoon, and as soon as the door was opened&#xD;
for admission of Sonsie and her waiter, the mother being off&#xD;
guard, superintending operations in the kitchen, they dived in,&#xD;
one and all, hurrying, scurrying, pushing, jostling, much to the&#xD;
annoyance of the ladies, who tucked up their dresses at their ap-&#xD;
proach, and trembled for their corns. They went curiously about,&#xD;
examining all the furniture, and exchanging slang comments.&#xD;
They seated themselves at the center-table, putting their gravelly&#xD;
shoes upon the polished rails, and took in their dirty hands the&#xD;
pictures and ambrotypes, breathing upon the glass, rubbing it upon&#xD;
their sleeves. Then they went about and handled the scarlet&#xD;
needle-books and delicate fancy articles, and asked questions and&#xD;
said "hugh !" when they did not understand, and snuffed, and&#xD;
coughed, and got before the great mirror (bought at a bargain,&#xD;
having a card stuck over one corner to hide the bit chipped off,)&#xD;
and they spit on their hands and anointed their hair, and danced&#xD;
up and down, and made faces. While still in the height of their&#xD;
&#xD;
stolen pleasure, a violent altercation was heard without, and pres-&#xD;
ently the door burst open, and Baxter, red and belligerant, made&#xD;
a dive inwards; as restrained by a party holding on to his gar-&#xD;
ments.&#xD;
'u I will go in, so now, there !" he exclaimed, as by a vigorous&#xD;
jerk he gained the victory. His mother looked in after him, red,&#xD;
like the boiled lobster.&#xD;
" Come out here, you sir, if you know what's good for your-&#xD;
self!"&#xD;
"I shan't nuther ; I'm goin' to stay here! -It's comfortable in&#xD;
here ; you don't never let me come in, now I'm goin' to ,stop till I&#xD;
see all your fixins."&#xD;
Mrs. Williams looked scorpions at her eldest son, but stood&#xD;
irresolute ; she used to lead him to school with a halter round his&#xD;
neck, when he played hookey ; he was getting too strong for het-&#xD;
now, and. she hated to tackle him. In an unlucky moment he&#xD;
stepped back, set his foot upon her new lace curtain, and tore it&#xD;
ruinously. It was too~ much  she, rushed, at. him in red fury,&#xD;
seized him by the hair, her favorite mode -of, attack, and pulled&#xD;
as hard as she could. He gave in, as the . tiger does under the&#xD;
discipline of the hot bar, and was dragged out; but he beat&#xD;
the tiger in howling, by odds. Before he reached the door he&#xD;
happened to catch Christabel's eyes fixed upon him in amazement&#xD;
and disgust. He.stopped his yells, or rather articulated them.&#xD;
" You'd better toddle home and nuss your torn cat, he wants&#xD;
you, he9 does," and treated her to a horrible grimace as he disap-&#xD;
peared..&#xD;
The rest'of the cubs scuttled out in double-quick, and Mary&#xD;
Ann tucked up the tattered finery, and looked frightened and un-&#xD;
happy.&#xD;
" Oh, my! what a dreadful hole ! How mad ma will be!" said&#xD;
she to Belle, who was bursting with laughter.&#xD;
"What of it ?" she replied, carelessly; " don't look as if the&#xD;
world was coming- to an end. It is vulgar to seem to mind such&#xD;
trifles; indeed it is a Bible injunction to take joyfully the-spoiling&#xD;
of your goods."&#xD;

After tea, Mr. Growing came in. He looked tired and care-&#xD;
worn. He had been out all day with his subscription paper, and&#xD;
met with little success. Some thought the old church good&#xD;
enough, some had no money, some were not going to be nosed&#xD;
around by Mrs. Deacon Williams, nearly all prayed to be ex,&#xD;
cused.uGeorge Blair and Ruth accompanied him. After some&#xD;
talk, Ruth said :.&#xD;
"It looks as if we were a day after the fair; I hope you have&#xD;
had supper."&#xD;
"Not this evening. I have not sat down to-day ; I did not go&#xD;
home after I left Deacon Proddy's, I was so dreadfully fagged;&#xD;
and I knew that my wife was here. I wish I had asked you for&#xD;
a cup of tea; I am always sure of your hospitality."&#xD;
at won't do," said George; "you should have come to the&#xD;
Horse-Shoe, you look fit to drop.".&#xD;
He went out into the kitchen. "Ah, Sonsie" said he to the&#xD;
little maid, who was washing up the best china, imder horrible&#xD;
penalties in case of breakage, and whose face laughed all over at&#xD;
t o h         Couldyou get M-r. Growing a cup of tea do you&#xD;
think -?"&#xD;
"And is it the tay ye'd be after wanting, sir ?" said she,.placing&#xD;
her stout arms in her favorite attitude, and glancing at him Over&#xD;
her shoulder. "It'11 be like pulling the teeth out of her, an' it's&#xD;
niver a one she's got; but-I'll do me best. Missis," she called&#xD;
after the retreating dame, who saw them and guessed what they&#xD;
were after. The tea-caddy is locked, sure, but there's about a&#xD;
thimble-full put out for breakfast ; I'll just take that, i think;&#xD;
it'll be a nice dacent pullin' for one, anyhow."&#xD;
She brought it fresh and hot to Mr. Growing, (whom George&#xD;
piloted into the kitchen for the purpose,) with the end of the loaf&#xD;
which was to have been her supper. He drank it eagerly and&#xD;
returned the empty cup, with a kind word or two, which delighted&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"I'd ga widouthme supper for you any day in the week," said&#xD;
she, mentally, as he walked away.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Mr. Growing had brought a book, and seating himself at the&#xD;
table, he said:&#xD;
" Ladies, would you like me to read to you for half an hour ?"&#xD;
One or two assented, the rest kept silence, and wished him&#xD;
away._&#xD;
"I think," he=added, looking around and smiling, " that it is as&#xD;
well to gather in all the good thoughts we are able, as we pass&#xD;
along."&#xD;
He sat awhile with his book open, waiting for the talk to sub-&#xD;
side. Most of those present respected the young pastor suffi-&#xD;
ciently to be quiet; but old Miss. Pettengill and Mrs. Esquire&#xD;
Hitchcock, and one or two others, either did not hear or did not&#xD;
choose to attend, and continued their conversation; and the group&#xD;
of giggling girls in the corner were too giddy to listen to anything&#xD;
sensible. Mr. Growing glanced. across at them once, or twice,&#xD;
and then sat looking thoughtfully down. His face saddened, and&#xD;
grew more discouraged. At length Ruth said, cheerfully:&#xD;
"Suppose you begin, si ; we will try to command ourselves to&#xD;
silence ; being women, it may be difficult."&#xD;
He looked pleased, and opened the volume he had chosen,--&#xD;
" Recreations of a Country Parson." His voice was fine, and he&#xD;
read charmingly.  Zoe, Sabrina, and Susie Jenkins grouped&#xD;
themselves around him, and Dulcet Pettibone struck an attitude&#xD;
of polite attention, with her forefinger on her cheek, and George&#xD;
stood near, leaning against the wall with his hands. behind him,&#xD;
and his eyes fixed upon Ruth's face. She sat gazing at vacancy,&#xD;
as soon as the reading commenced. Her motionless figure, draped&#xD;
in snowy cambric, and her bent head, were a study to the young&#xD;
giant, and Belle Brandon floated up to him and smiled.&#xD;
After a few minutes the ladies began to talk, at first in whis-&#xD;
pers, and then louder and louder; and then the gentlemen began&#xD;
to drop in, and poor Mr. Growing closed the volume with a dis-&#xD;
appointed sigh, and turning to Ruth, who looked up hurriedly, and&#xD;
saw Belle and George talking together, he said:&#xD;
" This is the fourth attempt I have made to enlist the attention&#xD;
of the ladies of this society in useful reading- I believe I must&#xD;

give it up.. I don't like to; I know much good might be gotten&#xD;
if they would attend."&#xD;
Poor man ! He had tried to start a debating glub, and a&#xD;
reading circle, and both had specially failed. The Millvillites&#xD;
were not a reading people. As yet they cared principally for&#xD;
getting ahead, and the young folks were coining up with little or&#xD;
no love for books or cultivation of any sort. He planted on a&#xD;
barren soil, so far as a hope of raising a -crop of literary taste&#xD;
was concerned, and while such people as Mrs. Deacon Williams&#xD;
were accounted leaders of society, there was little encouragement&#xD;
for the future. I have known ministQrs who, in Fred Growing's&#xD;
place, would have consoled themselves with the half dozen Roar-&#xD;
ing River families, where he would have found just the atmos-&#xD;
phere to suit him, but he was too delicately conscientious for that,,&#xD;
and even refrained from visiting much anvng them, because of&#xD;
the especial delight he experienced in their culture and elegance,&#xD;
saying to himself it is to the poor of this world that the gospel is&#xD;
to be preached.&#xD;
The young men liked attending the societies, and were very&#xD;
willing to pay their fee for the pleasure of the frolic, and the clos-&#xD;
ing delights of attending their favorites home. There had been&#xD;
a recent importation of a very fancy specimen of a young&#xD;
man.   He wore a crush opera hat, which he was always&#xD;
maneuvering to the intense astonishment of his acquaintances,&#xD;
mostly clerks, (" counter-jumpers," Belle called them,) and on a&#xD;
chain he had a nose nipper, which it made him dizzy to use; his&#xD;
moustache was. "lovely," and such dear little boots, and the seal&#xD;
ring on his third finger was as bigas those in the Egyptian Mu-&#xD;
seum. So much out of his element did he seem, that it would&#xD;
have been difficult to imagine what surge of the wave of life&#xD;
could have driven him upon this foreign shore, had'not his presence&#xD;
been explained by the fact that he was a nephew of Captain Slo-&#xD;
cum, and he fully set forth the absolute and striking contrastswhich&#xD;
crop out in our American families. His father sent him to Millville,&#xD;
hoping that he would settle down in the office of the Gonecussets,&#xD;
but as he sent along a servant to dress him, and permitted him to&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER. .        .   449&#xD;
indulge in trotters and accompanying luxuries, the G. M. C's.&#xD;
looked upon him with little favor.&#xD;
The daughters quite differed with their papas, and were enthu-&#xD;
siastic over the elegant creature who had not an s in his alphabet,&#xD;
and no end of nonsense in his daintily curled pate. He showed a&#xD;
decided penchant for Belle Brandon, who amused herself not a&#xD;
little with his mgincing prettiness and dandy affectations, and called&#xD;
him " Posey." His patronymic was scarcely in keeping with his&#xD;
exterior and pretentions, being only Brown; but his mama had&#xD;
done her best to compensate him for that, by bestowing fat the&#xD;
baptismal font the euphonious christian or pagan names of Cym-&#xD;
balius Adolphus, and very proud he was of them. Zoe Walsing-&#xD;
ham had some jokes at his expense, and said he was well named,&#xD;
being really a rare specimen of a cymlin.&#xD;
By-eight o'clock the young men were all arrived, brushed, per-&#xD;
fumed, and altogether comme ii faut. A head and shoulders&#xD;
above the rest, in his own opinion at least,. was Cymbalius&#xD;
Adolphus. He maneuvered his crush hat in the hall, shutting&#xD;
it flat at a blow, and made an extempore conundrum on the Mill-&#xD;
ville girls, which he had studied up and written out in the office.&#xD;
The bashful fellows who were trying to get courage to enter, and&#xD;
poking each other forward, took shelter behind his airs, and after&#xD;
he had carefully examined his neck-tie, and wiped his boots on&#xD;
the scarlet fly-brush, and said:&#xD;
"Ma foil these affairs are a bore, a nuisance, but come. on, fel-&#xD;
lahs,"-they all followed in his wale, and got in successfully.&#xD;
Belle Brandon did the honors of the house as if she had been&#xD;
the daughter, coolly keeping Mary Ann in the back-ground, who&#xD;
accepted the position as a matter of course.&#xD;
Chris stood in a window looking out into the summer night, lost&#xD;
' in a reverie, as much alone as if she had been in a wilderness,&#xD;
when a pair of soft little arms encircled her, and Pauline -Brad-&#xD;
shaw said caressingly :&#xD;
" You and I don't care about any of this, do we, Chris? I&#xD;
haven't had a good time at all, and I'm hungry. I only got a&#xD;
tiny piece of bread for my supper, and not a bit of cake. Gracie&#xD;

isn't here, and Dick wouldn't come; he's gone off a fishing; I&#xD;
wish I-had gone too, he asked me. I think it is dreadful dry, don't&#xD;
you? Come, Chris, you shall tell me a fairy story, that'is better&#xD;
than supper.".&#xD;
Chris returned. her caress, glad of. somebody to take into her&#xD;
arms, besides the.: real liking she had for the odd independent&#xD;
child, who never did exactly what was expected of her, but was&#xD;
always cropping out in unexpected developments.&#xD;
"Fairy stories, dear ! why you have pumped ie dry. I an&#xD;
sure you know all my tales so well that you could tell them bet-&#xD;
ter than I."&#xD;
Now, Chris, you are stuffed full of stories, you know you are!&#xD;
and such nice ones ! They don't have a tea-spoonful of story to&#xD;
a whole hogshead of remarks and moral observations."&#xD;
" Oh, you cute little critic ! I begin to be afraid of you."&#xD;
"Do-you know, Chris, I tried hard to read Daisy Chain, but&#xD;
it was so church and so good; I bate good books. And then I&#xD;
got 'Say and Seal,' and it seemed as if Faith never did anything&#xD;
but look up and look down, and make muffins. Oh dear, what a&#xD;
pity I thought about muffins, it makes me hungry again, and I'&#xD;
can't go home till Sabrina's ponies come. Now, Chris, I'll start&#xD;
you: ' Some children went into a wood to gather sticks ; their&#xD;
names were Gretchen and Hansel."'&#xD;
Chris laughed, and took up the tale at that point, and spun the&#xD;
woof out of her fertile brain, so that Pauline hung on her words&#xD;
with eager enjoyment; and- so absorbed were both in the woes of&#xD;
the hapless wood-gatherers, that they were utterly oblivious of&#xD;
the fact that Sabrina and Zoe had stolen up and were listening,&#xD;
and that Sam Slaughton had planted himself by the window, thus&#xD;
affording a support for lazy Chandy, who threw his arm over his&#xD;
shoulder, ard they, too, wandered in the dim forest, haunted by&#xD;
the dreary old witch whose chin was dressed with scattering hairs,&#xD;
so coarse that each seemed a -snake, and whose yellow fangs&#xD;
chopped together, when she poked out her claws of fingers huht-&#xD;
ing for poor Gretchen, to where the oven was red-hot, and the&#xD;
six black cats glanced at them with their eyes like balls6of fire.&#xD;

Belle Brandon found the time apposite, Mr. Hauxhur-st stood&#xD;
near, conversing with Mr. Growing, Jan Vedder and Cymbalius&#xD;
Adolphus werewithin hearing distance ; therefore she floated up&#xD;
to Chris in the step she had tried upon her hostess in the norn-&#xD;
ing, and seizing the skirt of the rapt raconteur i~n her thumb and&#xD;
finger, she sang, airily:&#xD;
"Wilt thou have a satin gown, bonnie lassie, lowland lassie,&#xD;
Silver tassels hanging down, bonnie lassie ? -&#xD;
For yours has got an awful hole, lowland lassie,&#xD;
And hasn't ever been darned at all, bonnie lassie," &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
"' The Fejee Islanders always stand on their heads when they&#xD;
tell news," piped Pauline in her shrill treble, jerking the satin&#xD;
out of Belle's grasp. "I wish you would go into the other room,&#xD;
Belle Brandon ; you are always in the way."&#xD;
The girls laughed and clapped their hands, and Chandy put his&#xD;
into his pocket for a penny, but remembering former experiences,&#xD;
he changed his mind, and kept quiet. Mrs. Hitchcock and old&#xD;
Miss Pettengill exchanged glances and spiteful sniffs.&#xD;
"Shiftless creature and so impudent! Adeizy Euphemy don't&#xD;
like her, not a bit."&#xD;
"P-culiar, I should say," cackled the ancient maiden, who was&#xD;
chewing flag-root, perhaps trying to console herself for her light&#xD;
repast.  ",Heow  do you admire that Christabel Goldsmith-?&#xD;
You are a coilneyswear, among the women I believe, Mr. Brown."&#xD;
" Most curiously and wonderfully made, madam," replied Cym-&#xD;
balius Adolphus, leveling his nose nipper at the spinster, " quite&#xD;
an ancient fossil ma foi."  Then turning to Sam, he added " I&#xD;
call that rather a neat reply, Slaughton, on the spur of the mo-&#xD;
ment too, next time let her call me names, 'conny-swear.' When&#xD;
I don't even dam."&#xD;
-Dicet and those more distant pressedl forward to see what all&#xD;
the laughing ivas about, and Pauline was very impatient at the&#xD;
interruption of, her pleasure. "Why can't they let us be, Chris.&#xD;
I wish I had a castle where I could lock you in, and keep those out."&#xD;
Now Otho Groenveldt had entered at the door while Chris was&#xD;

&#xD;
in the full tide of her narration, and had stopped in the shelter of&#xD;
the ample curtains, to study the changing face, whose moods were&#xD;
dearer than ever to him, and more precious, and he had been inly&#xD;
wondering at her forgetfulness of self, and the power she pos-&#xD;
sessed of throwing her soul into her story; painting her word&#xD;
pictures, so that her figures lived and loved and gladdened and&#xD;
suffered, and he studied also the wrapt faces of the eager listeners,&#xD;
who were sorrowing, rejoicing under her spell, and Otho Groen.&#xD;
veldt had heard the whole. With a slight frown and compressed&#xD;
lips, he watched-to see how she would comport herself under this&#xD;
provocation. She flushed blazing scarlet, the brilliant hue of the&#xD;
Pomegranate blossom-he held in his hand tied up for her with the&#xD;
purple pansies, and threw back her head like a startled deer, a&#xD;
sure sign she was much' excited or very angry, and faced about&#xD;
with a stinging retort on her lips; then glancing down at her torn&#xD;
dress, from which Belle's manipulations had pulled the pin; a&#xD;
swift change passed over her face, humble self-condemnation ruled&#xD;
out the pride and anger, and she quietly and softly took it from&#xD;
Pauline's hand, saying :&#xD;
" I feel and deplore my carelessness, Belle, as much as even you&#xD;
could wish to have me. I am very much hurt and cut up by your&#xD;
ridicule, so that I assure you, you hav'nt lost your trouble. Let&#xD;
me compliment you upon choice of time and place. It was skillw-&#xD;
fully if not nobly done. I'm but a sorry grub now, have a little-&#xD;
patience, and you shall see me cast my chrysalis and emerge a&#xD;
gay butterfly, and if you will please to let Pauline and me pass,&#xD;
we will seek a quiet spot where we shall offend your eyes no&#xD;
more."&#xD;
With a slight bow to her tormentor, she took the child by the&#xD;
hand, and left the window. The bystanders looked at each other&#xD;
and not a word was said among them while she remained insight;&#xD;
and Miss Belle was fain -to put .her arm within that of Cymba-&#xD;
lius Adolphus, and lead him away; sailing off with spread robes&#xD;
and much childish prattle to cover her 'defeat. Otho knew how&#xD;
much the effort had cost his fiance, and forgave the, unworthy&#xD;
dress, for the pretty dignity of her demeanor. He stepped for-&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER. ,453&#xD;
ward now, and arrested her steps, offering his hand. it was worth&#xD;
a journey to the Pyramids, that look on her face, love and pride&#xD;
and joy ; still Otho felt rather glad that his mother tias safely&#xD;
housed up at Craigenfells.&#xD;
Mrs. Williams, on the lookout to protect her belongings, per-&#xD;
ceived with much uneasiness, that the young element were pro-&#xD;
jecting a frolic of some kind, and trembled for her carpets and&#xD;
curtains.&#xD;
" Come girls," said she, approaching a group in eager conversa-&#xD;
tion, "supposin you kinder pair off, and play your play out in the&#xD;
kitchen, its nice and large, and a scrumptous place for a spree."&#xD;
"Certainly, madame," replied Zoe, " with the utmost pleasure,&#xD;
we flatter ourselves that we have a mission for adorning any sur-&#xD;
roundings ; and girls, don't let us lose the precious moments, ten&#xD;
o'clock will strike a great deal too soon. Let's have a game fof&#xD;
blindman's buff."&#xD;
All eagerly agreed, and the great kitchen was immediately&#xD;
lighted up with bright faces, and such gay talk and laughter as&#xD;
was not often heard there.&#xD;
" Now Mary Ann, you go and convoy the gentleinen, protect&#xD;
them through the crowd. I promised to call them as soon as we&#xD;
were ready. Zoe took the young lady by the arm, and tried to&#xD;
put her through the door.&#xD;
" I had rather not," said she, hanging back, looking, around at&#xD;
Belle as usual.&#xD;
" Poor lamb, is she afraid of the wolves ? well they are dan-&#xD;
gerous, but I'll venture. We must have gentlemen, there's no use&#xD;
denying, the fact. There's no good times perfect without them.&#xD;
I'm careful not to promulgate any such theory in Peter's hear-&#xD;
ing." (This addendum was mental.) She seized the tea bell and&#xD;
flew through the rooms, ringing a merry peal, and calling gaily:&#xD;
" Sir Knights to the rescue ! four and twenty damsels, await&#xD;
your coming in the howling wilderness-meaning kitchen-for&#xD;
the honor of chivalry, on'heaven and on your lady call, and enter&#xD;
the enchanted hall."&#xD;
The young gentlemen gathered in her wake, joking and laugh.&#xD;

ing, and they all disappeared through 'the door, which was care-&#xD;
fully shut behind them.&#xD;
"My goodness! what a bold piece !" said old Miss' Pettengill,&#xD;
to whom Zqe's fresh cheeks were extremely unpleasant. "Pretty&#xD;
peculiar, I should say, how folks can."&#xD;
" Miss Walsingham has a little exuberance of spirits perhaps,"&#xD;
replied Mr. Growing, to whom the' remark was addressed, "but&#xD;
life and life's trials will tame all that, soon enough;,we need a good&#xD;
portion of animal fire, to get on comfortably in this world of cares&#xD;
and perplexities, without sinking under them.'&#xD;
Old Miss Pettengill returned the young Pastor's rather sad&#xD;
smile with a most vinegar aspect.- She was as completely put&#xD;
out aswere Deacon Proddy and Caleb Catchen, who went to him&#xD;
for advice about their wild sons.&#xD;
" Gentlemen," said he, "ifyou wish to keep them from gross&#xD;
vices, provide suitable amusements at home. Put croquet on your&#xD;
lawns and billiard tables in your houses, and they will not be'&#xD;
driven to seek those sports among improper companions."  Poor&#xD;
Fred's life was a continual struggle. It was like harnessing a&#xD;
blooded young colt with a worn out ol plow horse ; he was fret-&#xD;
ting and wearing out his life in a vain effort to pull his yoke fel-&#xD;
lows on, trying to draw their. burdens as well as his own."&#xD;
" But are Ayou not afraid of encouraging levity ?" asked Mrs.&#xD;
McCross. ",We are to take Christ for our pattern,. and we ae&#xD;
told'he was never seen to smile."&#xD;
Mrs. McCross' -piety. was of the severe sort. Such as Mr.&#xD;
Webber says, " fills the door-yard with grave stones, the mansion&#xD;
with skeletons, and keeps the thought, 'I've got to die,' continually&#xD;
in mind.": Fred Growing smiled into her forbidding face.&#xD;
"My idea of Christ is quite different to that madam. He was&#xD;
a perfect man, and mirthfulness could not have been wanting in-&#xD;
him. He lived on terms of familiar intimacy with his disciples,&#xD;
ana it is not to be believed that in all those days of foot travel&#xD;
through the smiling country, there were no gay incidents, no&#xD;
mirth-provoking occasions, no jokes, no laughter. .,St. Peter&#xD;
&#xD;
could not have endured such a life, his mercurial temperament must&#xD;
have risen to the point of jollity. Sweet St. John's gentle face&#xD;
was 'often dressed in smiles, and as in water, face answereth to&#xD;
face, so the heart of Christ beat in unison with the disciples whom&#xD;
he loved. Had he been always sad, he could not so warmly have&#xD;
attached his followers, for however much we may respect a char-&#xD;
acter, we turn intuitively away from a clouded face, dressed&#xD;
always in gloom-; we respect at a distance. I have no idea that&#xD;
the Divinity was always, or even often, apparent in Jesus."&#xD;
O'd Miss Pettengill munched her flagroot in silence, she could&#xD;
scarcely take in the full heinousness of such dreadful heresy,.and&#xD;
Mrs. McCross shook her head, and from that evening she made&#xD;
up her mind that Mr. Growing was not the Pastor for Millville.&#xD;
Now he still further aggravated them by rising and placing his&#xD;
hand lovingly upon George Blair's shoulder, and. going forward.&#xD;
Strikingly dissimilar were they in physique, but the firm, steadfast&#xD;
giant turned his massive face toward the clear cut features of his&#xD;
boyhood's friend, and-he noted uneasily the hectic bloom'on his&#xD;
smooth cheek and the lustre of his eyes.&#xD;
" You are killing yourself, Fred. You are as thin as a shadow."&#xD;
4Better wear out than must out, George. I seem, to hear the&#xD;
heavy ripple of the dark river sometimes, but I shrink from the&#xD;
plunge. I hav'nt got dying grace yet,' and my work is not done."&#xD;
Mr. Growing put up his hand, and suppressed a slight cough, and&#xD;
his eyes smiled.serenely in his friend's face.&#xD;
" Don't talk that way, Fred. Just cut loose from these Mill-&#xD;
villites, and take a trip and get up your muscle, and don't cough&#xD;
like that, it hurts me."&#xD;
" Don't fret about me, George, old fellow. I'm in my right&#xD;
place: come, let us look in on these young /people. I enjoy their&#xD;
frolics."&#xD;
" And that fellar is'nt a professor neither, he's as thick with&#xD;
him as if he was a deacon ; peculiar I should say."&#xD;
Mrs. Jenkins smiled. ~" Our great Teacher ate with publicans&#xD;
and sinners," said she.&#xD;

mCnt, Cymbalius Adolphizs rose and offered his - arm to miss&#xD;
Brandon. " Allow me," said he, "suppose we go and see how&#xD;
these rustics 'amuse themselves, a curious study, are they not ?"&#xD;
Belle showed him her eyes and her teeth, and they followed&#xD;
close after George and Mr. Growing.&#xD;
" Brave fun, this, Miss Brandon," said George, when her silken&#xD;
robes .rustled against him and her perfumed curls swept his sleeve&#xD;
in her effort to see into the kitchen. " Upon my word, I like such&#xD;
frolics, they keep the heart young-if anything can," he added,&#xD;
pushing off his hair with a tired gesture.&#xD;
"Come George Blair," called out Zoe, as soon as she saw -him,&#xD;
seizing his hand, and trying to pull him into the room. She might&#xD;
as well have tried to pull in the oak trees which shaded the&#xD;
window.&#xD;
w Do come, there's a good fellow," said she, ceasing her efforts&#xD;
and taking up her choicest weapon, entreaty, " we want you for&#xD;
blindman; excuse me Mr. Growing, but this is clearly Mr. Blair's,&#xD;
field of usefulness just now."&#xD;
" Me, Missey !" said George, surrendering himself good natur-&#xD;
edly, and letting himself be pulled. " You forget that I'm the&#xD;
father of a family, a man of many cares, grave and decorous, bet-&#xD;
ter take some of these young fellows, there's Chandy, he's&#xD;
fleet as Mercury."&#xD;
"Sit down," replied Zoe, for all answer, "the mountain must&#xD;
come to Mahomet," (having convinced herself that on her tippest-&#xD;
toes she could not reach. his face.)  . -&#xD;
" Well, a woman must have her way though the heavens should&#xD;
fall."&#xD;
"I forgive the unworthy remark, because I know you will ac-&#xD;
quit yourself admirably as blindman. Now, what do you see be-&#xD;
fore you ?" adjusting the handkerchief and holding up her hand,&#xD;
" speak quickly, and speak truly."&#xD;
" Well then," replied George, leisurely, "I see a pair of ugly&#xD;
green eyes, for one thing, and a little bit, of a nez retrousse, that&#xD;
narrowly escapes being Pug, and-"&#xD;
&#xD;
"You need not go on, sir," said Sam Slaughton. "It is, patent&#xD;
to all of us that you are as blind as a bat."&#xD;
"Now Gaffer, eat your soup," said Zoe, with a laughing ac-&#xD;
knowledgment of Sam's compliment.&#xD;
"Where is my spoon, Goody," replied George, rising and&#xD;
stretching out his hands.&#xD;
" Go and find it on the floor,&#xD;
Call out it's name in gentle roar,&#xD;
Or hunt for spoons forever more."&#xD;
Tliis regulation opening was the signal for beginning the game,&#xD;
and the players crept and sidled, and ran aid pushed, and little&#xD;
explosive bursts of laughter flew about, as they got behind the&#xD;
massive shoulders of the young blacksmith, and twitched his coat&#xD;
tails, and pulled his hair.&#xD;
He, good-natured giant, permitting all sorts of liberties with his&#xD;
great person, and feeling his .way with outstretched arms,. as poor&#xD;
blind Sampson felt for the gates of Gaza. Mr. Growing looked&#xD;
on, enjoying, and laughed heartily when George caught Zoe, who&#xD;
puffed out her cheeks and held her breath, while he passed- his&#xD;
hand over her face and :shoulders and finally dismissed her, her&#xD;
identity unguessed, though the dull Gaffer laughed a short laugh&#xD;
as she slid out of-his arms.&#xD;
Even Cymbalius Adolphus seemed in danger -of, catching the&#xD;
infection of fun, and said, "Aafoi," and edged about here and&#xD;
there, as-Gaffer's fingers came in too close proximity to him. Belle&#xD;
Brandon stood on her dignity, and curled her lip disdainfully.&#xD;
The flushed eager faces of the girls and their graceful motions&#xD;
vexed her, she could have slapped them for looking so pretty,;and&#xD;
said offensively, when Sabrina tame near her:&#xD;
-I don't see how Miss Bradshaw can join in such a country-&#xD;
fled log-house sort of a game. Why.they romp like. servants."&#xD;
"And yet I've seen you dance the German, Miss Brandon,"&#xD;
said-Sabrina, "the cushion, and the whip," and her curtesy and&#xD;
smile were very provoking.&#xD;

was=on the lookout for Gaffer. " Per haps being in Turkey she&#xD;
does as Turkeys -do," said ahe. " It's a bore, but "-just 'then&#xD;
George laid a hard on.his shoulder,-and he wriggled like an eel,&#xD;
and squirmed out of reach. "You see, Miss, Brandon, one does&#xD;
i6t like to have one's bi-oadcloth seized on by the .ruthless hands&#xD;
of the rabble," he came back and explained. Belle receivedhis&#xD;
palliation very indifferently, -for she was by this time watching&#xD;
Ruth, who had somehow drifted into hervicinity. A sudden im.&#xD;
pulse seized Belle, and she pushed, the. little woman right into her&#xD;
husband's outstretched arms. He felt her face, for an instant, she&#xD;
standing pale and motionless.&#xD;
"It is my wife," said he, the mirth all dying out of his face, as&#xD;
he pulled off the 'bandage, and walked away. Belle was still&#xD;
looking cidriously at them, when Sam Slaughton came up wping&#xD;
his hot face.&#xD;
"A:A'are frolic 'this, 'Miss Brandon."&#xD;
"You  eer- to enjoy it. I am :afraid. I am not quite fond of,&#xD;
'romping."&#xD;
" Those back-handed hits of yours. are scathing," laughed Sam.&#xD;
"You'see Mrs.'Blair is quite of 'my opinion, Mr. Slaughton,&#xD;
she does- not smile on the furious mirth, even though her charming&#xD;
h band consetfs to lend himself to its promotion."&#xD;
" You greatly err then," said Ruth, quickly. "I like nothing-&#xD;
better than acharmless frolic, though'a headache prevents me this&#xD;
evening' from. joining it."&#xD;
"-YOu said.headache, I think," questioned Belle with a saucy&#xD;
face.&#xD;
"I=did,".answered Ruth very angrily. "I said 'headache.".-.&#xD;
"4 I thoughtI understood.you," replied the-blonde, a provoking&#xD;
smile wreathing her lips.&#xD;
'You are mistaken then,'for~you do:notand, cannot understand&#xD;
me. Themedium through which you loolk is too grossly dark-&#xD;
ened-"&#xD;
A-soon asilRuth 'had. spoken, she was angry with herself for&#xD;
being so roiled by her beautiful tormentor, whose steely eyes.fairly&#xD;
glitteed; 'and.she involuntaeily glanced 'around to see if her- hus.&#xD;

band was looking at them. ,Belle had said her say, as it seemed,&#xD;
for she turned to Cymbalius Adolphus.&#xD;
I should like to sit, if you will undertake to pilot me safely&#xD;
through these dancing Dervishes, Mr. Brown."&#xD;
"Certainly, with pleasure.  I discover ;some wooden con-&#xD;
trivances, we will suppose them to be chairs, of ancient -pattern,&#xD;
produced evidently, in the infancy of the useful arts. Scarcely a&#xD;
fit throne for so much- beauty, but ma foi, in0Turkey."&#xD;
This'observation seeed to be quite a stand-by of Mr. Brown's,&#xD;
and he laughed in a conceited, selfosatisfied way at his.wit.: In&#xD;
threading their course through the crowd of players, just as they&#xD;
-reached the great fire-place,-some one of .the spoons fleeing: be-&#xD;
fore-Gaffer blindman, (who, horresco referens!r was Rev. Mr. Fred&#xD;
Growing,) ran against Miss Belle from-behind, and projected her&#xD;
into a sitting posture, the floor, being scrubbed and waxed into a&#xD;
state of exceeding slippiness. The suddenness, and solidity of&#xD;
her descent elicited =an involuntary grunt kfrom'the fair overthrown,&#xD;
and so astonished was she at her performance, that -she satstill,&#xD;
looking with helpless, perplexed gaze :at. her two feet sticking&#xD;
straight out before her. An incipient titter recalled her to a&#xD;
sense of her ludicrous position, and in'endeavoring to gather her-&#xD;
self up she struck against a cricket, which dodged off and knock-&#xD;
ed:down the kitchen tongs, which hit the forestick (nearly burned&#xD;
through,) and scattered the glowing coals over the hearth, and&#xD;
plentifully besprinkled the hide of :Bax Williams' bull-terrier,&#xD;
who, though' a' valiait fighter when he met. his - adversary in fair&#xD;
field, now started up and darted hither and 'thither among the&#xD;
spoons, oversetting some, who fell, and lay where they fell, dodg-&#xD;
ing around others, who hopped and scrambled nimbly'out of his&#xD;
way, and finding no egress, the singed brute ran howling under&#xD;
the table,:and thrashed about like a dog gone frantic. Those dis-&#xD;
tant from the fray:smelled the odor afar off, and got anxious to&#xD;
learn the cause of the general mix ; and Jan Vedder put a climax&#xD;
to the tumult by screaming "mad dog" with all the ,force of his&#xD;
powerful lungs, mingled with. snaps and snarls'and deep mouthed&#xD;
bayings, which he had an almost ventriloqual power ofi producing.&#xD;

&#xD;
Then, indeed, the confusion became desperate, and those wh'&#xD;
could not get out mounted: the chairs and tables; The women&#xD;
squealed and the men battled with each other for dear life ; and&#xD;
I can't tell where it -would have ended if Bax had not fought his'&#xD;
way up to his property-and ejected him with many kicks and&#xD;
curses, which he was mentally applying to Jan Vedder, who was&#xD;
nearly bursting.&#xD;
"He aint mad nuther i not half so mad as you be, you blasted&#xD;
Dutchman. Shut up your chops or I'll take the tongs to you."&#xD;
Chandy mounted upon a stand and 'clapped his hands and ex-&#xD;
plained as well as he could for laughing; but it was some time&#xD;
before order was restored and the coals swept up, and biting re-&#xD;
marks flew about poor Jan's luckless head, who was regarded as&#xD;
a greater reprobate than ever.'&#xD;
"I say, Chandy, I had no idea of kicking up such a row," said&#xD;
he, careless of their opinion; "-but was'nt it a lark ? how they&#xD;
did all pour in here. Did you see Miss Dulcet?  By Jove, she&#xD;
got both arms around the captain's neck, and the deacon squeezed.&#xD;
Sue Jenkins-mistook her for his wife, of course, or Mary Ann.;&#xD;
but he did not long enjoy his error, for she wriggled away like&#xD;
an eel. They say he has an eye for fine girls, and who has a&#xD;
better right, if he is a deacon !"&#xD;
What with the turmoil and confusion, and rushing to and fro,&#xD;
Belle still sat uponthe floor, and she had enjoyed the fun with&#xD;
so keen arelish as to forget her own mortification. Christabel&#xD;
now came up, and offered to assist her, and at the same instant&#xD;
Chandy took hold of her arm.&#xD;
" Take her up tenderly, handle with care,&#xD;
Fashioned so slenderly, young and so fair."'&#xD;
She threw him off angrily, and springing to her feet she walked&#xD;
proudly away, throwing indignant glances among the girls as she'&#xD;
passed them.&#xD;
She is dreadfully put out at our laughing, I know. I'm ever&#xD;
so sorry ; but I could'nt help it. She looked so funny, hitting&#xD;
down so plump."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I've most reason to be put out, Sue, for I heard her: talking&#xD;
me up to that horrid grinning wretch with the eye glass, a while&#xD;
before her accident; but I don't bear any malice. She and I&#xD;
have different ideas of lady-like propriety, I think, and- she may&#xD;
act as she likes. I'm going to speak to her."&#xD;
"I'll go with you, Sabrina. Indeed I know I ought to apolo-&#xD;
gize. Oh dear ! she does not look very propitious, does she ?"&#xD;
Belle, seated in the parlor, with Cymbalius Adolphus at her&#xD;
side, looking volumes of tender commiseration, had evidently no&#xD;
intention to be gracious. On the contrary, pride and anger sat&#xD;
throned. in her eyes, and she pretended not to see Sabrina, who&#xD;
walked up with Sue Jenkins in her wake.&#xD;
"I hope,. Belle, that our game of log house romps has not been&#xD;
the means of getting you a serious hurt. You must try to forgive&#xD;
our laughing. I believe total depravity must bear the blame."&#xD;
"I am not hurt in the least," replied Belle coldly ; "and you&#xD;
are quite welcome to any mirth you have enjoyed.  Ce' monde est&#xD;
plien de fous. I shall endeavor to summon fortitude to endure&#xD;
existence, even though Miss Bradshaw has laughed at me."&#xD;
Feeling that she had quenched Sabrina as, well as turned a&#xD;
handsome period, quite in the Chris Goldsmith style, she glanced&#xD;
around upon the gentlemen who came to condole, andfound en-&#xD;
joyment in being the center of attraction, even through a down-&#xD;
fall; and she leaned back in her chair and looked languid and&#xD;
interesting. George Blair came up among other sympathizing&#xD;
inquirers, and as the others. dropped off one by one, he was left&#xD;
alone, standing close to her chair.&#xD;
"I have something to tell you, George," said she, turning and&#xD;
laying her hand upon his arm.&#xD;
" Oh yes, I remember you promised me a secret. You've ,ben&#xD;
flirting with Cymbalius Adolphus, and you wish to confess. Now&#xD;
then, begin."&#xD;
"'Oh, George, you know I. despise that fellow, and I never flirt.&#xD;
I may take you for confessor sometime, naughty George;. but not&#xD;
here. (She spoke his name with tender accent, as if she loved&#xD;

When I openmy heart to you nImust be sure there 'are no.&#xD;

Georg threw    ?astonished look down : her. She did -not&#xD;
return his glance, but he saw that her face was flushed and her&#xD;
hand trembled. In an-instant she tossed off her curls and smiled&#xD;
as she said-enthusiastically -._.&#xD;
How:very lovely Ruthie is to-night; such brilliant color, and&#xD;
really I had:no idea she could throw so much soul into her eyes.&#xD;
You ought to have her picture as she stands now."&#xD;
George looked over where she pointed, and started, and a cloud&#xD;
of ineable sadness settled over his noble face. His wifewas&#xD;
listening to Otho Groenveldt, who spoke earnestly to her. er&#xD;
eyes were fastened upon . his, and she drank in his words ob-&#xD;
livious of her surroundings. Belle: Brandon threw Geraldine&#xD;
glances among the three, and darted them at Chris, who, had&#xD;
Pauline in her arms.&#xD;
Up ii the dressing-room, half-an-hour after, Zoe exclaimed:&#xD;
"Oh, girls, have we not had:a splendid time !"  She was pinning&#xD;
on her shawl, and was exceedingly rosy and pretty. "I declare,&#xD;
my sides ache: with laughing ; George Blair was so funny. I&#xD;
thought he would finishne -off. the last part of this evening. I&#xD;
never so limso 'full of jokes'&#xD;
" He's a glorious fellow, answered Sabrina with enthusiasm&#xD;

He isindeed," spoke up 'Belle,'going gracefully close to them.&#xD;
"It is really too hard that you should have carried £off such a&#xD;

to charm him away from you now."&#xD;
the laughedlier nusical ripple of a laugh with hertempting&#xD;
moth close to Ruth's cheek. Ruth hastily' applied her handker-&#xD;
chief to the place, which burned crimson, and shaking her of, she&#xD;
turned atiout 'ithoet looking ather. Wheny at the foot of'the&#xD;
great staircase, her stalwart husband offered his arm, she replied&#xD;

"Thank you, George ; I've my dress to nind. It suits me&#xD;
better to walk alone::&#xD;
And they went out into the darkness, a heavier gloom settling&#xD;
upon their hearts and deepening into their lives. George crossed&#xD;
h  hands behind his back, and kept his eyes fixed upon- the&#xD;
crapching gravel, and his wife held herself aloof, not touching him,&#xD;
even with her garinents. The angry contempt had vanished from&#xD;
her face, and left heavy sadness in its place.'&#xD;
"Iuth!" poke George suddenly. " Ruth, you' are not satis-&#xD;
fled with your life."&#xD;
u Is jt likely, that I should 'be. satisfied with the dregs, when, I&#xD;
have a right to  brimming cup? I was satisfied. It was full&#xD;
and luscious. I drank, oh I so sweet a draught. But I was&#xD;
jostled 'and disturbed,.and now there is -nothing left but bitter-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
' I see, I see," said George, his voice' full of tender pity. "I&#xD;
hope it is not too late. I understand' you,:Ruth. It is a hard&#xD;
case ;I see only one way out. - You should have-been more open&#xD;
0ith ne, dear child.' I would have spared you the suffering.&#xD;
You' have a right to a better life, than I can give you. Let me&#xD;
thank you for all your sweetness; you have made the two years&#xD;
rich in blessing. I have felt no want, strange as it seems now ;&#xD;
but it would have been better to have' confided. in me. I never&#xD;
dreamed that you were carrying a sore heart under your cheer-&#xD;
ful ways."&#xD;
"G eorge Blair!" spoke up Ruth vehemently. "Is not the&#xD;
deep misery and the hard wrong enough, without these wicked&#xD;
words ? Oh! cruel, cruel!"&#xD;
She went into they houseand shut her door, and tore 'off her&#xD;
hat and covered her face, as if she would shut out life, and hope&#xD;
together ; and George' tramped up and down, the garden for&#xD;
hours, with set face.: He was trying ,to bring himself to take a&#xD;
resolution' which it crushed his heart to harbor, and he battled&#xD;
sternly with himself,,but got no victory.&#xD;
Belle Jrandon was in her own room; Mary Ann was assisting&#xD;
her to undress or rather waiting her pleasure while she' applied&#xD;

candle grease to her little nose, a supposititious remedy for an in.&#xD;
cipient redness she fancied she discovered, and she stood before&#xD;
her mirror and laughed to herself.&#xD;
"Good gracious! how people will be made fools of; so vain&#xD;
ai'e all things here below, the men, especially. 'here's that giant&#xD;
of a blacksmith, don't know whether he stands on his head or his&#xD;
heels, When I look at him."&#xD;
"Where's the use of your flirting so, Belle ? I don't believe you'&#xD;
will get married so quick for-it. You make all the men afraid of&#xD;
you, George Blair is no good, anyway-a married man."r&#xD;
"That is all you know about it; it is really remarkable how&#xD;
quick you can flounder out of your depth, my dear, though I think&#xD;
you'have some help in your present remarkable observations.&#xD;
He-is a capital specimenfor practice. I never in the whole i ange&#xD;
of my varied experience, got such glances as he is capable of 'be.&#xD;
stowing; and the best of it is; he don't know what his eyes are&#xD;
telling me. I flatter myself I have taught him the use of his&#xD;
feattires since I made his acquaintance, and wonderfully hand-&#xD;
some he is; has decidedly the grand air. Such a man would&#xD;
suit me.nicely, if he had a couple of millions. I think I rather&#xD;
dote upon the majestic, powerful type of manhood; it is some-&#xD;
thirig to have a giant .at one's feet, who could crush you in his&#xD;
great strong arms. That little roly-poly has no business with&#xD;
such an athlete."&#xD;
"Why Belle, how you do run on to-night! I thought you&#xD;
liked Jan Vedder, or Sam Slaughton, or.Otho Groenveldt,--"&#xD;
" Stop there ! I hate that fellow, he is a cunning, sly wretch,&#xD;
always studying people, and that tiresome, learned- slattern is a&#xD;
dose. I haven't half done with those two yet; he thinks he is&#xD;
invulnerable with his supercilious looks, perhaps -he is, we've&#xD;
plenty of time to try that on. As for likings, don't for one mo-&#xD;

Vedder would not be a bad part, though he drinks like'a fish,&#xD;

have come out. There are plenty of men, besides the one in the&#xD;
moon, and I'm not goingto oblige Aunt Isadore so much as to&#xD;
slip off quietly. I intend to see what society is, made of before&#xD;
I jump into matrimony. I'm in no hurry to nurse babies and keep&#xD;
a'house. If my face and figure won't buy me a nice, rich, hand-&#xD;
some husband, I'll know the reason why ; and the best fun of the&#xD;
whole will be to make Auntie furnish the trousseau. Good gracious.&#xD;
how that woman grudges me everything I It is like pulling teeth&#xD;
to get my needs now, and how I shall enjoy seeing -her writhe&#xD;
when I come to ball-dresses and jewels. Jolly time have I yet&#xD;
for plenty of flirtations and loads of offers, and I'm fully resolved&#xD;
to turn my back upon ma tante and quietly give her the col&#xD;
shoulder; when I'm mistress of the establishment I'm to conquer -&#xD;
for myself. I have not forgotton old Soapfut, and how she would&#xD;
have tied me up for life, if I had not made faces and turned -up&#xD;

their way to the sewing-society, and having performed abreak-&#xD;
down, illustrated with grimaces enough. for a cannibal sacrifice, he&#xD;
brought out from behind the bushes,, where he had' hidden it,,a&#xD;
huge i-at-trap, of the corridor pattern, having doors at-either end&#xD;
which fasten up: with 'springs. It, was nicely baited with meat,&#xD;
the firstnibbling of which ought, t kill or something mangle the&#xD;
unlucky captive.&#xD;
Creeping and wriggling, reptile fashion, close to the garden&#xD;
fence, he planted it hard by Rainbow's-bower, and tried the effect&#xD;
by snapping the spring once or twice, when the doors 'clashed&#xD;
down'with a cruel sound.&#xD;
" Golly! that's a bully contrivance. If it don't kill old Tommy,&#xD;

They espy something galloping towards them in hot haste. It&#xD;
was Rainbow, whose eyes glittered with green fire ; he greeted&#xD;
them with an anxious permow, and rubbed against Chris so ear-&#xD;
nestly that he lifted on to his hind legs every time.&#xD;
"What is it, Rainbow ?" asked Chris, patting him.&#xD;
He ran on a few steps and then came back leaping, and begging&#xD;
them to hurry.&#xD;
" He is ins trouble, somehow," said Chris.&#xD;
"Let us follow, and see what it is," answered Otho, readily.&#xD;
Rainbow finding that they understood him, bounded toward the&#xD;
asparagus bed, and paused close by the trap. They looked&#xD;
closely, and discovered his pet duckling a fast prisoner within the,&#xD;
corridor, one door having snapped down upon his tail, so that alt&#xD;
his struggles could not get it free. It had not-the same effect upon&#xD;
him, however, that fastening' down a donkey's. tail, has, viz., to&#xD;
prevent his braying, for he. gave out at stated intervals a mela;n-&#xD;
choly quack, evidently a continuation, of a long series, and which&#xD;
dreadfully afflicted Rainbow, who walked around the prison and&#xD;
mewed piteously.&#xD;
Otho lifted the door, and ducky paddled out. Rainbow in-&#xD;
stantly seized him by the neck, and trotted off to the pond, and&#xD;
dropped him in. Ducky not at all astonished or alarmed by the&#xD;
order of' his going, tucking. up, his paddles comfortably, as a boat-&#xD;

bank to.-make sure that he was all right, then he lapped:eagerly at.&#xD;

CHA PTE-R TWENTY-N'INTH.&#xD;
SIR JOHN CHANDOS AND THE SILVER LAKE GODDESS.'&#xD;
IT would have been patent to the most casual observer that&#xD;
"Sir John Chandos, rich in'all knightly virtues," had something-&#xD;
on his mind,. He stopped dead still, with a hair-brush in each&#xD;
haiid, and gazed at the impossible posies on his slippers, and then&#xD;
sat down on. the, edge, of his bed, with his coat on his arm, and&#xD;
coming to a little, he got into that garment, and studied carefully&#xD;
the evolutions of a bumble-bee, (performing wheel and counter-&#xD;
wheel before the window,) his brows contracted and his eYes coy-&#xD;
eing the droning, buzzing   tactician-as if his welfare&#xD;
erg  rnigbuzig tciin        s fhswlae depended&#xD;
upon seeing him safely through.&#xD;
Getting by slow stages to the end of his toilette, he looked, as&#xD;
his mother often said of him, with great pride, ' as if he had just&#xD;
stepped out of a band-box.' ' Then he took his bamboo under his&#xD;
arm, and went out of the front door and down the long path, out&#xD;
through the gate, whistling disconsolately. So absorbed was he,&#xD;
that he nearly ran over Sabrina and Pauline, who were saunter-&#xD;
ing leisurely past the Goldsmith mansion.&#xD;
"CGoddess of the silver lake, all hail !" he exclaimed,' his brow&#xD;
clearing instantly. "You come floating by, like a violet cloud on&#xD;
purpose to help me out of my difficulties.'"&#xD;
" Oh how nice and flowery you are, Chandy; I do admire, of,&#xD;
all things, the highfalutin style. Is it that you have difficulties oh&#xD;
mortal, 'wandering in doubtful mazes ?  Speak ! they shall di-&#xD;
solve from our gracious presence like morning mists before the&#xD;
sunshine."&#xD;
(468)&#xD;
&#xD;
"'Why you see, Sabrina, it is a trifle, but one of the few trifles&#xD;
in which I am not posted. I wish to purchase for Chris a dress,&#xD;
or dresses, as may be, one for the fair, at any rate."&#xD;
"Oh, Chindy ! thank you for a dear fellow," said Sabrina,&#xD;
warmly. "I so longed to speak to you about that, but I was&#xD;
afraid you would take offence."&#xD;
"I'm such a tremendous fire-eater," interrupted Chandy, laugh--&#xD;
ing; "you are quite right to stand in awe of me. Well you see,&#xD;
terrible as I am, I don't know how the deuce I'm to inquire for&#xD;
what I want. 'Stuff for a dress,'-that won't do, because then&#xD;
the unpleasant clerk would be sure to say, 'What kind of stuff?'&#xD;
and there he would have me, helpless as a new-born babe. Now&#xD;
I am your escort, you, Miss Bradshaw, are shopping, and allow&#xD;
me to attend you. You can look at me, and I'll nod when I like&#xD;
anything, and ' Richard is himself again."&#xD;
"Certainly, Chandos, I shall be delighted, I'm sure ; but sup-&#xD;
pose we were to stop and make Ruth go with us, she is so expe-&#xD;
rienced, you know.&#xD;
- "Just as you say; but I assure you I consider your taste fault-&#xD;
less"&#xD;
" Oh, of course ; but shall I confess to you, I know as little&#xD;
about prices as you do about fabrics ; I am ashamed of it, but I&#xD;
always order my dresses from Lamode's, trimmings and every-&#xD;
thing, and my hats same way. Papa always shops with me all&#xD;
the time I am in New York, and I get what I like, and he pays&#xD;
the bills."&#xD;
"That is the way Chris ought to do, and by Jove she shall&#xD;
after this."&#xD;
"I don't know, Chandos; it saves bother to be sure ; but a de-&#xD;
signing person, (and I am told there are suclh in the dry goods&#xD;
line, inoffensive as most of them look,) might take us in and do&#xD;
for us, in fact, cheat us out of our eye-teeth."&#xD;
"Very sensible indeed, always supposing that we have cut&#xD;

Still, laughing and chatting, they walked into Ruth's open. door,&#xD;
and explained rapidly and. concisely; but though she laughed at&#xD;
their fun, they were surprised to, hear the little matron decline to&#xD;
accompany them, and. she persisted in declining, in spite of their&#xD;
entreaties,' and she flushed up. and seemed ill at. ease.; and Sabri.&#xD;

CHAPTER THIRTIETH.&#xD;
" IT IS NOT THE FROCK WHICH MAKES TRE JBRIAR."&#xD;
MILLVILLE EMPoRIUM! The New Bazaar, by Starbird &amp;amp;&#xD;
Pedlow. Shining with fresh paint, glaring with plate-glass, orna-&#xD;
mented by a vast sign, in gilt letters a foot long. No end of&#xD;
cheap hose suspended from revolving hoops, swinging about the&#xD;
doors. " Great bargains in cheese cloths !"  " Wet cottons from&#xD;
the fire!"  "Remnants!! Remnants! !"&#xD;
Within, a walker, gotten up with high art, paraded back and&#xD;
forth, bowing ands smiling, " What will you, look at, ladies ?"&#xD;
(blandly.) "Mr. Jones, show the parasols," (with sudden access&#xD;
of severe dignity.) . A lot of fancy clerks, their -hair all parted&#xD;
in the. middle, behind the counters, suggestive of tremendous&#xD;
trade ; frantic calls of " cash," and little boys bumping each other&#xD;
in their mad haste, wheezing like damaged. bag-pipes, as if their&#xD;
sleeping quarters had been subject to draft, and they had all got&#xD;
cold.&#xD;
Sabrina and Chandy were in the thick of it, the counter piled&#xD;
with silks' and muslins. The pale clerk had already exhibited a&#xD;
score of them, gathered in his hand, and struck an attitude, with&#xD;
his head on one, side, and fingers spread on his hip, left foot in&#xD;
third position, and remarked plaintively of each:&#xD;
" Yes, ma'am, cheap and putty, too."&#xD;
But Sabrina, who entered into the pleasure of shopping. with&#xD;
girlish gusto, had only selected a purple percale, which Chandy&#xD;
laid, aside as soon as she pronounced' it "lovely."&#xD;
"It is so, amiable, extremely so."&#xD;

The firm, square step of an "American trotter" on the 'aard&#xD;
road, and alight carriage drew up to the curb-stone.&#xD;
"Whoa, Tramp! steady, sir!" and Otho Groenveldt.sprang&#xD;
out, and offering his hand to Ruth Blair, she leaped to the ground,&#xD;
and the two entered the emporium together, and passed up its&#xD;
length, (regardless of the bland walker,) in deep conversation,&#xD;
At a little nook of a counter, they paused, and the lady asked in&#xD;
a low voice for organdies, and she turned them over, inspecting&#xD;
each with a business face, but not finding what she sought. Otho&#xD;
laid his hand on one she had rejected because of its price, saying&#xD;
in the caressing tone he so rarely used:&#xD;
"This one, Ruthie."&#xD;
It was a wreath of pansies on a clear white ground, and as&#xD;
sheer and fine as gossamer. Ruth looked up in his face and&#xD;
smiled.&#xD;
"Always violets."&#xD;
"Can you wonder, when you know how the thought of my'&#xD;
darling comes with them, and the hope of my, happiness ?  You-&#xD;
love pansies, Ruthie; you wore a breast-knot of them yesterday;&#xD;
I came near putting my lips to it in my pre-occupation. What&#xD;
would you have done, if I had ?"&#xD;
Ruth smiled a queer smile. She was thinking of a pair of&#xD;
fresh lips which had pressed her flowers.-&#xD;
"You are too discreet ever to forget proprieties, Otho,' she an-&#xD;
swered.&#xD;
"' It is not the frock which makes the friar,' Ruthie, but you&#xD;
know what lies beneath my silence better than any person living.&#xD;
Don't blush, I'm not going back to forbidden times ; here comes&#xD;
our clerk with a fresh supply, but we'll take this one. And you&#xD;
will finish it for the fair; and Ruthie, you mustlet me come and&#xD;
look sometimes, how you get on."&#xD;
"That I can't promise, Otho, but I'll do my best; only I fear it&#xD;
costs too much. If it should be extravagance !"'&#xD;
"What a dear,,mercenary, watchful Ruthie; but I know you&#xD;
love me, you have told me so a great many times, and I believe&#xD;
you. It will not be extravagance: set your little heart zt rest."&#xD;

It was not time for George to come home from the foundry,&#xD;
but here he came, sauntering along the banquette; like a good-&#xD;
feeling emperor, and Belle Brandon, exquisitely attired, walked&#xD;
dl at his side. Whether it was a chance meeting or an ap-&#xD;
proudl y&#xD;
ointment does hot appear, but she could not have looked more&#xD;
consciously radiant had he been the lawful capture of her bow&#xD;
and spear.&#xD;
" Come into the Bazaar, a moment George, if it will not be too&#xD;
much trouble. I must buy some hair-pins, unless you are afraid&#xD;
Ruth will be jealous. I fancy you are not one of the husbands&#xD;
who add to their business announcements of future plans, 'W.P.&#xD;
wife permitting,' however.".&#xD;
"I have not so issued my cards, as yet," answered George. "I&#xD;
don't imagine that my wife will take the trouble to be jealous&#xD;
about the unmarketable piece of goods she possesses--a great lum-&#xD;
bering giant."&#xD;
She made a piquant reply, whose relish lay more in manner&#xD;
than matter, and he glanced at her with such a look as one gives&#xD;
to the gambols of a frisky kitten, as he walked through the door&#xD;
by her side.&#xD;
"Look George," said she in a low tone, laying her hand famil-&#xD;
iarly on his arm. "Look, what a number of our acquaintances&#xD;
we are about to meet. Chandy Goldsmith and Sabrina. Brad-&#xD;
shaw, Dulcet and Captain Slocum, and can it be! Yes it is, Otho&#xD;
and your wife, up yonder at the silk counter.'&#xD;
George's eyes followed her's, and his forehead contracted into&#xD;
a troubled frown. The pair were looking in each others faces as&#xD;
if whispering.&#xD;
"I wonder you permit such flirting, I do indeed !, If I were&#xD;
your wife I should not like you to be so careless of my actions.&#xD;
It would make me very unhappy." She spoke i a light teazing&#xD;
tone, and threw into her swimming.eyes a glance which said plainly&#xD;
"Oh, what bliss, if I were."&#xD;
The 'purchase was completed, and while Otho waited for his&#xD;
change, Ruth walked briskly down to the ribbon department.&#xD;
Perhaps it was the magnetism of his presence which made her&#xD;
look around, with the pleasant brightness yet on her face which&#xD;

her womanly love for pretties.had given it, or it might have been&#xD;
the glamior of Belle's Geraldine glance, at any rate she turned&#xD;
about 'with the violet sash in her fingers, ani saw her husband and'&#xD;
the beautiful blonde. She had a box of hair-pins in her hand,&#xD;
and was pointing out to him the. picture oh the lid. She noted&#xD;
that she looked radiant, in some sense triumphant, and that her&#xD;
listener's face was genial and amused. It was a long time since&#xD;
Ruth had seen him thus, and she turned her back upon the two,&#xD;
bitterly angry, and contemptuous, and busied herself among the&#xD;
ribbons. The thought passed through her mind that George.&#xD;
might wonder at her being there, but it was blotted by a vision of'&#xD;
Belle's muslin, and blue crape hat, trimmed with wind-flowers,&#xD;
and turned to sourness by a survey of herself in the great mir-&#xD;
ror before her. Only a brown cambric and' a gypsy hat of'her&#xD;
own fabrication, as plain and simple as could be.&#xD;
Belle floated up to Dulcet, whom she saluted graciously, and'&#xD;
she gave her little gloved hand with affecting- candor to the&#xD;
Captain. He was full of important business, looking out sharp&#xD;
after Dulcet's bargains. To say truth, he had generously offered&#xD;
to defray the expenses of the outfit, butshe stoutly refused, pre-&#xD;
ferring to make her school money do, and he sIily and with more&#xD;
delicacy than might have been expected from his gruff Texas&#xD;
ways,,kept his eyes upon whatever she seemed to admire, and&#xD;
when after inquiring-the price, she rejected it, he made up -his&#xD;
mind to buy it himself, and 'have it in the house all ready after&#xD;
the important ceremony should be consummated. " Jerusalem&#xD;
crickets !" said he privately. "I may as well go the whole fig-&#xD;
ure. There's no use in looking as sour as the northeast corner&#xD;
of a grave yard about a-little expense. If a woman is worth&#xD;
harnessing into the team, she's worth spending money on. I cack-&#xD;
alate this female school ma'am shall have all the toggery she&#xD;
wants," and he chuckled as he hadidone often, with a keen relish&#xD;
of the humor of the scene on- the'.hill side. "-She fixed me, b.y&#xD;
Jupiter t brought me right up to the rack, fodder 'or no fodder,&#xD;
and she did it genteelly too.  Captain," says she, "I'll come&#xD;
down alone," haw, haw ! "but she concluded to top for nie after&#xD;

about all the pinching and saving that the law allows, Good&#xD;
feeding, good times and a plenty of em. will bring her out rmaz-&#xD;
ingly " It was in this state of mind that 'he volunteered to see&#xD;
Dulcet through her shopping, and really enjoyed the novel sur=&#xD;
rounding:of silks and finery. While Dulcet was pausing with a&#xD;
wisful look.over a tempting crimson and black brocade, Belle&#xD;
made her little speech.&#xD;
"Shopping, Captain Slocum ! and looking as satisfied overthe&#xD;
business .asany woman of us all."&#xD;
" No ma'am. I can't be said to be actually shopping myself.&#xD;
I'm squarin Miss Pettibone. She's got rather a heavy bill to buy,&#xD;
and I'n lookin out.for these smooth tongued fellars, to see that&#xD;
they ai'nt cheatin her."&#xD;
" What do you'think of this silk, Belle," said Dulcet, turning.&#xD;
around pleased and important, placing her finger upon the fabric;&#xD;
upon which gleamed the whopper of a diamond. "Pupple is a&#xD;
trying cojor, but pupple is fashionable. I'm so pufckly fastig-&#xD;
ijous. I don't know which to select."&#xD;
The Captain having observed that she had unwillingly rejected&#xD;
the crimson brocade, replying to the clerk's earnest and confiden-&#xD;
tial recommendation, "Yes certainly, unique and gorgeously&#xD;
beautiful, but rather'expensive," he told'him behind his hand to&#xD;
cut it off; and lump it."&#xD;
"I say Captain," said saucy Chandy, "have you seen our red&#xD;
cow to-day."&#xD;
" Haw- haw," roared the captain, intensely-tickled. " You may&#xD;
examine that little sparkler with a my-crascope, if you hanker to,&#xD;
Goldsmith. It'll bear a good' strong one: not much of any chip-&#xD;
pings there."&#xD;
" Do let me admire your finery, Dulcet' said Belle.&#xD;
Dulcet extended her hand, and Miss Brandoa looked closelyat&#xD;
the stone, while the Captain rugged Chandos, and winked.&#xD;

"You going to mount earrings, Captain.  Isn't that a little&#xD;
heathenish.",&#xD;
" She is. I've got em now," replied the Captain, slapping his&#xD;
pocket, and getting purple in the face, with trying to suppress his&#xD;
feelings. " She don't know it, but I've got 'em, all safe. Each&#xD;
earring'is a solitary, and the handkerchief pin has got nine, about&#xD;
as white stones in it as they have 'em. Ball &amp;amp; Black ain't ne&#xD;
where. 'I bought em of a Senora, and I paid for 'em. I got 'em&#xD;
for an investment, and I've been carryin em round in a leather&#xD;
bag. I've invested 'em now. I can afford 'em too, and "any'&#xD;
thing else she takes a fancy to."&#xD;
"You are a glorious trump, Captain," replied Chandy, shaking&#xD;
his rough hand warmly, "and I wish you joy with all my heart. "&#xD;
Belle meantime had finished her inspection of Dulcet's ring.&#xD;
" Very pretty indeed, Miss Pettibone, but diamonds need such&#xD;
elegant things to go with them, (looking at Dulcet's turned silk&#xD;
and dyed ribbons) point lace and velvet at least. It is horrid&#xD;
taste to wear them with common fabrics. You'll have put it by&#xD;
till you can coax enough-out- of the Captain, or else stick to your&#xD;
school-room longer."&#xD;
"Thank you."   Dulcet withdrew her hand indignantly. - "I&#xD;
flatter myself, Miss, Brandon, that I have dignified my occupa-&#xD;
tion, and I have no need to coax Captain Slocum. Since I have&#xD;
consented to accept his hand, and link our fates at the hymenial&#xD;
altar, I have been only troubled to repress his ardor for lavishing&#xD;
upon his affianced bride the most expensive and resplendent gifts.&#xD;
As Miss Pettibone, I prefer my independence, further I will not&#xD;
say.&#xD;
Belle laughed, and glided off to Sabrina. " What a place for&#xD;
meeting one's acquaintances," exclaimed she, greeting the Silver&#xD;
Lake goddess with gushing sweetness. "You buying pretties,&#xD;
too! I declare, I believe you are all going frantic over dry&#xD;
goods."&#xD;
" Come here, Belle, and see something," called out Pauline, dis-&#xD;
playing the percale--she took the most eager interest in the shop-&#xD;
ping, as soon as she found out that it was for her charming raconteur.&#xD;

",That will fade ma petite, one washing will turn it into sad&#xD;
colored feuille de mort."&#xD;
"Chandy! Oh Chandy ! You must'nt buy the amiable dress&#xD;
for Chris."&#xD;
" And wherefore not, most parlous sweetness?"&#xD;
"It will fade."&#xD;
" Who says so," spoke up Chandy, not at all pleased-he' ad-&#xD;
mired the percale.&#xD;
"Belle Brandon, she just told me, please don't buy it, Chandy,&#xD;
pick out another. I don't want my dear Chris to have ugly faded&#xD;
old dresses any more."&#xD;
"Pooh ! Nonsense, Pauline. It won't do any such thing, the&#xD;
fellow said it would bear biling, and offered to chaw a piece, if I&#xD;
doubted him.   You just present my compliments to that young&#xD;
woman, and tell her she will fade before that does."&#xD;
"I will," said Pauline,-running off delighted with her ,message.&#xD;
All this while George Blair had stood gazing in sad intentness&#xD;
at Ruth, who had not appeared to observe him. Now he walked&#xD;
up the long store with his grand stride, as handsome and power-&#xD;
ful as Prince Magnanimous in the fairy tale. Otho evidently had&#xD;
rather he had stayed. away ; but he greeted him with his usual&#xD;
grave courtesy. Perhaps George did not see his proffered hand;&#xD;
at any rate he kept his own firmly clasped behind his back.&#xD;
" The bazaar is in luck to-night. I had no idea of finding you&#xD;
here, Ruth."&#xD;
" I should suppose not," she replied significantly. "Neither&#xD;
did I expect you at so early an hour. Of course we are both&#xD;
dutifully delighted."&#xD;
George looked hurt and displeased, but made an attempt to be&#xD;
cheerful, without any real good humor.&#xD;
" I shall, walk home with you, Ruth," said he firmly, ",when&#xD;
your purchases are completed."&#xD;
" Thank you, I have an escort who drives a fine horse. I can-&#xD;
not find it in my heart, to disappoint him or myself in the airing&#xD;

to walking, and it is a pleasure Irarely enjoy."&#xD;
It did not need the hurt, grieved look on her giant's face to&#xD;
make Ruth thoroughly ashamed of her flippant conclusion. She&#xD;
could not have uttered it, had not Belle Brandon just then nod-&#xD;
ded joyously, throwing an airy kiss. =&#xD;
"QReorge," said Otho, gravely, looking from one to the other hi&#xD;
diseased surprise. "Will you oblige me by taking Tramp to&#xD;
drive your wife home or elsewhere, as suits her&#xD;
" No sir, I will not oblige you, neither will I drive your horse.&#xD;
ai not fond of driving borrowed horses, therefore till I can own-&#xD;
one I will walk.&#xD;
george's answer was short and given without any smile to&#xD;
relieve its rudeness, and he walked off like an offended autocrat.&#xD;
Belle Brandon put her hand on his arm as he passed her. "Stay,"&#xD;
said she, "I have a thing to tell you."&#xD;
"excuse me, I cannot wait to hear it," said he, striding on,&#xD;
"Unmannerly'gianti in a pet I believe. Oh what fun to see the&#xD;

"What is the matter with George Blair ?" asked sharp little&#xD;
Pauline. "tie looks as mad as a wet hen. I didn't know but he&#xD;
was going to just walk over me."&#xD;
"What,iindeed !" murmured Ruth among the ribbons. "The&#xD;
world is going wrong way with us "both I think. You need not&#xD;
wait for me, 'Otho," she said, without lifting her face. "I have&#xD;
chosen the sash. The color suits exactly, a lovely shade. I must&#xD;

CHAPTER THIRTY-F]IRST.&#xD;
WORKING AND SINGING.&#xD;
For- the next fortnight, 'young and old were busy, getting&#xD;
ready for the Fair. All the fancy things had to be finished; and&#xD;
Belle Brandon was as sweet and fascinating as she could be, keep-&#xD;
ing the girls up to it, and they met together at the different houses,&#xD;
every afternoon, and worked like busy bees, from two o'clock till&#xD;
six, though the days were drowsy and sultry. In the evenings&#xD;
the young gentlemen always came, and they had frolics and games,&#xD;
before strolling home in pairs through the dreamy summer silence.&#xD;
Sometimes they rambled off up the glen, past the rumbling,&#xD;
crushing engines, resting now like cloyed monsters, except one&#xD;
or two not yet satisfied, and their red fires glowed like angry eyes;&#xD;
and along the grassy path to Petrifying Spring, where they&#xD;
sat down on the mossy tree-trunks, and sang their own songs, to&#xD;
the tinkling accompaniment of the dropping water, which filtered&#xD;
through the rocks, and fell with ceaseless hurry into the dark pool&#xD;
below ; and above all their sweet music rose the organ tone of&#xD;
Roaring River, forever and forever speeding its sounding way&#xD;
to meet the sea.'&#xD;
Belle rarely refused to sing in those times, and those who heard&#xD;
her never forgot the songs, even when they had ceased to speak&#xD;
often of her. Such tender pathos, such deep feeling ; her listen-&#xD;
ers could not choose but weep if she willed it. It would seem&#xD;
hard to believe that the soul she threw into her ballads was only&#xD;
manner, because her deep eyes glistened, and her voice, trembled,&#xD;
and her wrapt face was tender 'and pitiful. -Sam  Slaughton&#xD;
(480)&#xD;
&#xD;
found her charming, and Jan Vedder could have kissed the ground&#xD;
she trod on. In.fact, I am not sure that she did not note down a&#xD;
couple of fresh offers in the little book she kept for that purpose.&#xD;
She used to laugh and show it to Mary Ann, and tell her she was&#xD;
preserving the volume for her grand-children.. "A little book&#xD;
for them to look upon, when I am dead and gone," she said.&#xD;
Even Chris forgot how tormenting she had been to her, and&#xD;
the other girls took her decidedly into favor.: A4 the last they&#xD;
had to go about from house to house, committees for refresh-&#xD;
ments, with pencil in hand, to note down who might be counted&#xD;
as providers, of cake, and who of milk and eggs for-the ice.cream;&#xD;
and everybody felt relieved when Dulcet undertook the, chicken&#xD;
salad; and the captain put the cow ponies at her service, and him-&#xD;
self also.&#xD;
Then the Town Hall had to be trimmed with ornamented and&#xD;
appropriate mottoes, (flags had not come into fashion then.)&#xD;
I expect these young.people will remember, all theirlives, the&#xD;
sayings and doings of those two weeks. I know some, qf them&#xD;
can never forget, because-.they colored their whole fug  Chris,&#xD;
for one, felt very happy. Her mother.was busy doing the heavy&#xD;
work with MrsJeacon Williams arid the rest, intending to sub-&#xD;
stitute labor for 'money ; as. she. had less time for the Great&#xD;
Tribulation, she was quite pliable, and really worked, rather&#xD;
peaceably in harness with the others. Madame Groenveldt had&#xD;
withdrawn her inspection (which always kept Chris in an under-&#xD;
current of discomfort,) and convoyed the dear oldProfessor:home&#xD;
to Rosenbloom directly after the Soyez lecture, Everything was&#xD;
in train for her approaching school-life, and a most enjoyable&#xD;
look-out in thatdirection; and Sabrina and, Zoe nearly protect-&#xD;

NOTHING TO WEAR.&#xD;
THE eve of the important day had drawn her sable curtains&#xD;
round, and Chandy was in the seventh heaven of a choice Ca-&#xD;
banga, (naughty boy, he had no business to smoke,) still he looked&#xD;
very comfortable sitting on the wide piazza, with his feet elevated&#xD;
in the young America fashion, which so horrifies Mr. Dickens.&#xD;
Of course Englishmen always keep their pedal extremities plant.&#xD;
ed on their mother earth. Chris came up and dropped a light&#xD;
touch upon hid shoulder.&#xD;
"Chandy, dear, I am wandering in a labyrinth of perplexity.&#xD;
I am forced to call upon you for aid and counsel."&#xD;
"You've hallooed the right party, we keep the pure article at&#xD;
this shop ; state your case. What lack you? where lies your&#xD;
grief?"&#xD;
"Not here; you must be in the presence of the perplexity to&#xD;
comprehend and catch the clue."'&#xD;
"What! up-stairs! That's a bore, a nuisance, as our friend&#xD;
Cabby says. -Do you know who Cabby is ?"&#xD;
SNo, unless it is short for Caliban, and I don't remember any&#xD;
such utterance of his."'&#xD;
"Quite a bird of another color. Cymbalius Adolphus, the&#xD;
mirror of exquisites, the glass of fashion, and the mould of form.&#xD;
All the fellows call him Cabby now, and hail him with a finger,&#xD;
'Cab, sir!' He gets furious about it, especially when Belle&#xD;
Brandon happens to hear. I expect he will fight me when he&#xD;
gets his courage 'nailed."&#xD;

" Let poor Mr. Brown rest now, Chandy, (he is. a harmless&#xD;
insect,) and be serious. Come along, don't be so lazy, or I'll set&#xD;
mother at you with a lecture on slothful servants. Paugh ! what&#xD;
a horrid smoke !"&#xD;
"You really mean it !" questioned Chandy coolly, emitting the&#xD;
grey vapor through his nostrils, and watching in indolent enjoy-&#xD;
ment its. airy flight. "I know a cove as smokes a pipe. You&#xD;
like that better, perhaps. Oh, why can't you leave a fellow&#xD;

now, being full of malicious bravery, dost thou come to start my&#xD;

He grumbled all the way, and, yawned fearfully; but suffered&#xD;
her to drag him up-stairs, allthe while perpetrating The most ab-&#xD;
surdly warped quotations from his favorite study, whom the ir-&#xD;
reverent young puppy was accustomed to call Billy Shakes.&#xD;
On the bed lay two dresses, gossamer fabrics both ; one pure&#xD;
white, the other having a tiny border of wreathed pansies on the&#xD;
floating skirt and sleeves.&#xD;
Chris placed in her brother's hand a note, turning aside and&#xD;
busily examining the snowy robes while he read it. It was very&#xD;
short.&#xD;
"SAPrno: Let her be violet-crowned; I know she will be sweetly smil-&#xD;
ing, These pansies are for thoughts; I shall see them to-morrow evening.&#xD;
Do not disappoint me.                             OTno."&#xD;
"Is'nt Mr. Otho rather rushing things, Chris? I should sup-&#xD;
pose the Goldsmiths- could attend to their own getting-up as yet,&#xD;
though I must say they haven't improved their privileges much in&#xD;
your behalf. -Still, I call this performance a bit of impudence.&#xD;
Just bundle the thing up and send it back with my complinents.&#xD;
Iiow dare he take such a liberty with my sistei'-!"&#xD;
"Why, Chandos ! - You said I might keep the books, you&#xD;
know. I don't think it is impudence; The idea of Otho's being&#xD;
impudent ! Besides, I have a confession totrkake."  Chris treni-&#xD;
bled and glowed.&#xD;
Candy hooded his ,handkerchief over his fore-fingers, and&#xD;
held them up together, as children do when they say,'"Father,&#xD;

I confess."  He drawled it out whimsically, and the penitent&#xD;
made a low reverence-,&#xD;
" Well, child, well," (Priestly confessor bows his head.)&#xD;
"Father, I stole a pig,"&#xD;
went on Chandy."&#xD;
" Oh ! do hush, Chandy. Has life nothing real and serious for&#xD;
you?"&#xD;
Chandy dropped his ftn at once, when he saw her eyes full of&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
"Christabel, dear sister !" he looked quite another person, and&#xD;
really dignified in his handsome blooming youth. "Tell me, if&#xD;
you please."&#xD;
"I. shall be Otho's wife," said Chris, hurrying on. "I am&#xD;
promised to him. Perhaps he thinks that gives him a sort of&#xD;
right. I longed to tell you, but you areso merciless."&#xD;
Chandos went up .and took both her hands and kissed her&#xD;
cheeks. " You make me ashamed, upon my soul you do.' Poor&#xD;
friendless child ! you could not come to your good-for-naught&#xD;
brother, and had nobody in whom to confide."&#xD;
" Oh yes, I told Rainbow," replied Chris; smiling through her&#xD;
tears. " But you hav'nt taken in the whole situation yet, Chandy.&#xD;
This is Otho's dress, the pansies, [her eyes lighted at the thought,&#xD;
as, the faintest pansy breath always filled her soul with emotion.&#xD;
'It was the flower of remembrance']; but this one, this gem!&#xD;
this snow-drop of a thing ! and just arrived. I took it in lit the&#xD;
door from Dennis -Eagen, who grinned delighted. Now what&#xD;
does this mean? Is it that my wardrobe is the care of the com-&#xD;
munity ?"&#xD;
" Well, not quite, I think. I arrogate to myself the credit of&#xD;
that production. That is, the Silver Lake goddess and I evolved&#xD;
from our consciousness the fact that you must have an evening&#xD;
dress, and we produced it."'&#xD;
".Ah! Sabrina. Well, she's kind, and you are a darling; but&#xD;
does it not strike you that it is a burning shame for me to .ie&#xD;
&#xD;
clothed clandestinely. I wonder what mother supposed I was to&#xD;
appear in to-morrow evening."&#xD;
" Could'nt say really. What were your own plans on the sub-&#xD;
ject ? Of course you had plans. You knew I was - available if&#xD;
you needed me."&#xD;
Chris colored, and came down off her high horse of indigna-&#xD;
tion, looking foolish and condemned.  " To speak the truth,&#xD;
Chandy-"&#xD;
" Certainly,. Chris. 'Thy truth, then, be thy dower !"&#xD;
"I must say that I had not given a thought to my dress. I&#xD;
had a set of drawings to finish, which I want to give to Ruthie,&#xD;
and a white sacque for Sonsie, that I cut from an old skirt of mine ;&#xD;
and the Professor asked me to help him in his translation of&#xD;
Little Barefoot. You know his English is rather shaky ; and&#xD;
there were fifty pages to copy. And you know we've been sew-&#xD;
ing all the afternoons. I've been up at five o'clock, and have not&#xD;
wasted a minute ; and really, Chandy-"&#xD;
"INuff sed. Now the point is, whom will you delight to honor.&#xD;
Shall it be the doctor or your devoted ?"&#xD;
"You shall decide that for me, Chandy.".&#xD;
"Shall I? Well. If you wer-e anybody else I should say&#xD;
send the gown back thundering quick; but your's is an excep-&#xD;
tional case, and I must own that Otho is an exceptional fellow.&#xD;
I love him, Chris. I hav'nt forgotten 'the fool's leap.' I am&#xD;
glad you love him, though indeed I foresaw the ending.  ve&#xD;
turned it over in my mind a thousand times. His confounded&#xD;
proud ways are trying occasionally; but he comes the nearest to&#xD;
being worthy of a Goldsmith of anybody I know, and upon my&#xD;
soul, Chris, I rejoice in your happiness, and under the circum-&#xD;
stances I think perhaps you had better give his gift the preference.&#xD;
But remember, young lady, you shall come out in mine the first&#xD;
school party we have."&#xD;
" There still remains a trying duty for me to go through," said&#xD;
Chris, after thankfully accepting Chandos' congratulations. "&#xD;
must tell mother. I could not go away from papa's house till I&#xD;

have explained my position. I'llgo this instant and get it of my&#xD;
mind. What do you suppose she will say ?"&#xD;
"I don't see the particular necessity of speaking to her," re-&#xD;
plied Chandy carelessly, relapsing into his laziness. " But if you&#xD;
think it needful, go ahead, I give you my blessing; and now I&#xD;
suppose I can get leave to finish my cigar. Poh! it has gone&#xD;
out; I'must light another.&#xD;
*Joys that we've tasted have been known to return,&#xD;
A pipe that's once lighted may continue to burn;&#xD;
But a cigar that's gone out is a paltry concern.'"&#xD;
Chris appeared before her mother, and said, without taking&#xD;
time to falter-..&#xD;
"Otho Groenveldt has asked me to marry him."&#xD;
"Asked you to fiddle-stick !"- The widow eyed her daughter&#xD;
over grimly. "You're a nice article to get married!. The fools&#xD;
*ain't all dead yet!"    -&#xD;
She waited to, hear what Chris would say next. As she did&#xD;
not open her lips, she was fain to prolong the argument by ins&#xD;
quiring ;&#xD;
"And pray what did your smartness tell Otho Groenveldt.".&#xD;
"I told him I. should certainly be, most happy to do so, and&#xD;
thanked him kindly for the honor," replied Chris, smiling bitterly.&#xD;
Though she had not expected any demonstrations of affection, she&#xD;
yearned for something more than this; and after listening a mo-&#xD;
ment to her mother's clicking needles, and watching mechanically.&#xD;
the jerk of her sharp elbow, she said, with a 'slight tremble in&#xD;
her voice:&#xD;
"Have you nothing to say to me, mother?. no word of love or&#xD;
warning ?"&#xD;
"As you seem to have got it all cut and dried without consultin'&#xD;
of me, I wish lhim joy of his bargain, but - I, don't make no ac-&#xD;
count of itno way; puppy-love never amounts to shucks."..&#xD;
Chris turned on her heel and walked indignantly from the ma-&#xD;
ternal presence. To hear her matchless Otho's fondness, grave,&#xD;
dignified, manly, precious, spoken of as puppy-love !  It was&#xD;
.o much!&#xD;

CHAPTEk THIRTY-TiIRD.&#xD;
THE FAIR.&#xD;
. Trn Town Hall was all buzz and flutter, gay with lights and&#xD;
greenery. There had not been such an occasion since that fourth&#xD;
of July when the, young people rode around the village in a- boat&#xD;
on wheels, drawn by eight horses; each maiden crowned with&#xD;
flowers, and bearing aloft a little flag inscribed with the name and&#xD;
motto of the State she represented; -when they tried to 'make&#xD;
Dulcet take "Texas-the lone star," and she wouldn't, and the&#xD;
stella glory had been borne by the labrose Adeliza Euphemia;&#xD;
and they had wound up the festivities 'by a grand overset of the&#xD;
amphibious conveyance, a mix up.of the northern and southern&#xD;
interests, and a gorgeous ball in the evening.&#xD;
I was there that time, Elinor Walsingham took me over in her&#xD;
carriage. I danced with Alec Craigenfells. Heigh ho&#xD;
There was a difficult task to be matured before the arrivalof&#xD;
the expected crowd. The tables must be assigned to the- young&#xD;
ladies.- Everybody wanted fancy things, an nobody was willing&#xD;
to take the refreshments. Belle tried with sugared.words to ins&#xD;
duce Zoe to have an ice cream table, but she plumply refused.&#xD;
She had gotten a rare India muslin for the occasion, and looked&#xD;
as fresh as a rose in it, and she had no mind to have it ornament-&#xD;
ed with coffee spots, and flavored with vanilla. ,She would have&#xD;
needle-booke; and she would have nothing-else. As Sabrina had&#xD;
entirely provided her table with boquets and costly knick-knacks,&#xD;
of course she was not to beasked, and eft whiles the Geraldine&#xD;
look began to appear in Belle's face.&#xD;

Chris came with Chandy. She looked wondrous fair in her&#xD;
airy muslin, but the pansies at her breast quivered with her flut-&#xD;
tering breath, and her face had something stormy in it. The&#xD;
widow had been unpleasant about the dress, and would have for-&#xD;
bidden her to appear in it, but for Chandy, who came upon the-&#xD;
scene when the vituperations were culminating, and just quietly&#xD;
settled the old lady, speaking to her in his droll way some very&#xD;
plain truths; -andsafterwards he praised Chris, and her dress, and&#xD;
hair, and kissed her fingers and her lips, and patted her pretty&#xD;
neck and her arms, and told her how lovely she was, and did his&#xD;
best to help her to overcome her nervousness under the appropri-&#xD;
ateness of her perfect evening dress; and he talked fun to her all&#xD;
the way, so that at the hall door she had turned around in impul-&#xD;
.sive thankfulness and kissed him.&#xD;
"You are a wonderful fellow, Chandos; I can't think where&#xD;
you got so much wisdom and such power. You are but two years&#xD;
older than I, and here I am a trifling child, and you are a man.&#xD;
Upon my word you were terrible to-night ; I was quite afraid of&#xD;
-you."&#xD;
"'Jove. sometimes went disguised, and why not I?" quoted&#xD;
Chandy, drily. - "I can stand a good deal of that sort of thing,&#xD;
you know, Chris, and .especially from you. Now then for a gay&#xD;
evening."&#xD;
But Chris had been crying and she showed. it; and Sabrina&#xD;
and Zoe-knew it when they went up and kissed her. Belle knew&#xD;
it, and rejoiced, and she seized upon her immediately.&#xD;
"I've a coffee-table for -you, dear," said she, and she turned&#xD;
over in- her mind the feasibility of dashing a splash of the bever-&#xD;
age over that beautiful dress at an early stage of the evening.&#xD;
" Come this way, please."&#xD;
" Shall you take a coffee-table, Chris ?" asked Irene Bisbee.&#xD;
"I shall" taJle anything Belle pleases to give me," replied Chris.-&#xD;
"I don't see any great choice of positions, and if I were to.give.-&#xD;
an opinion I am afraid I should, say it is a bore to stand anywhere.&#xD;
I cannot beg people:to buy, and talk to them, so I shall be but a&#xD;
lay figure at the best."&#xD;

Here Zoe broke in with a laugh: " Fancy what I heard Dulcet&#xD;
Pettibone say to Judge sistaire just now. There he stands, that&#xD;
fine-grained, delicate-faced man."&#xD;
"Something learned, of course."&#xD;
"Oh no; she informed him with many smiles, that she opined&#xD;
we should have a door-fee, because, as the. old woman said at the&#xD;
caravan, 'it is worth quarter of a dollar to see so many men.'"&#xD;
"Sensible to the last ; shows that Dulcet is assimilating to her&#xD;
futor, as is very proper for her. .I can imagine the horse-laugh&#xD;
with which Captain Slocum received the speech. See him look&#xD;
at her!"&#xD;
"I'll tell you,.Zoe, what I should like of all things to do this&#xD;
evening. Ishould like to be invisible, and sketch the groups.&#xD;
That marvelous head-gear of old Miss Pettengill's, and Deacon&#xD;
Proddy's nose, like the tower which looketh toward Damascus,&#xD;
and upon which he blows up the trumpet in the new moon; and&#xD;
that Mr. Brown, with a waist like a ' pismire.;- and here comes&#xD;
mine ancient enemy, Adeliza Euphemia. What a piece of work&#xD;
is .she ! in form and moving how express and admirable, as Chan-&#xD;
dy might say;~ the beaut of the world, the paragon of animals"&#xD;
" She's that, sure, at al events," said Zoe, rejoicing over Chris&#xD;
" whatever else she may be, she's a perfect animal."&#xD;
" Come, come, girls, doh't let us be ill-natured," said Sabrina,&#xD;
who rarely lent herself to any backbiting. " Belle is coming to&#xD;
make another pounce upon Chris; she has got Irene placed, but&#xD;
she cannot have Chris, she shall stand at my table and -sell the&#xD;
meerschaums, (taking up one.)  I read a book lately where the&#xD;
heroine's neck was compared to meerschaum clay ! suggestive,&#xD;
isn't it.?"&#xD;
"A change from alabaster, at any rate, which has done duty so&#xD;
long"&#xD;
"Bertha, you are always obliging, I need not ask you twice."&#xD;
Bertha moved politely away with Miss Brandon, and Sabrina&#xD;
said:&#xD;
" Belle's virtue is rewarded, she has found an ally at last. Now&#xD;

" Shall that part be assigned to the one who has the most&#xD;

'So sayeth the;dame," replied Zoe.&#xD;
"Don't trusthim, Zoe," said Susie Jenkins, softly; look at his&#xD;
eyes.'"&#xD;
"It is proper for us to measure and- ascertain who it shall be."&#xD;
Saucy Chandy brought his phiz close to Zoe's velvety face,&#xD;
before Susie's warning.was fairly uttered, for which he ,got what&#xD;
he. deserved, a smart box~on theear.-&#xD;
"You 'would. never think of treating Sabrina in that way,"&#xD;
said .Zoe,, coloring violently, and -glancing hurriedly around.&#xD;
" Sabrina, fair, devout and pure,&#xD;
Sober, steadfast, and demure,'&#xD;
said Chandy, bowing, and applying his handkerchief, to his ear,&#xD;
as he sauntered off in pursuit of more mischief. He came close&#xD;
to Pauline, and Gracie Jenking, and had .. quiet little lapgh'&#xD;
They had been wandering hand in hand, with Dick as escort, uyp&#xD;
and down the hall,:peering, listening, and ;getting fun out offev-&#xD;
erything, and paused by Mrs. Esquire Witchco k, who was cut-&#xD;
tng up cake as if slaughtering an animal, her gown tucked&#xD;
out: f Jharm's, way, and giving a view ofher petticoat,,showy&#xD;
with black braid.&#xD;
&#xD;
"See,"-said Pauline," Mrs. Hitchcock:has .got fiverows of:grief&#xD;
around her petticoat, and three on her handkercha. She's mourn-&#xD;
ing dreadfully. for somebody."&#xD;
Before 'he .had finished ;laughing, he heard Otho, speaking to his&#xD;

"J;hope you have not injured the bone, madam; it was ase-&#xD;

":I don't never use no liquors, Inside nor out."&#xD;
"A little salt and vinegar."&#xD;

If she heard the remark of a young farmer to. his friend :&#xD;
"'Come, Stephe, let's have a cup of coffee from this pretty one&#xD;
who's forgot to put her dress on to her,"-I say if she heard the&#xD;
remark, it did not in the least discompose her-; she offered him'&#xD;
the cup with such bewitching innocence and such a trusting look&#xD;
right into his eyes, as a girl gives to a dear brother, and it effect.&#xD;
ally stopped the bold speech upon his lips ; he found it impossi-&#xD;
ble to discourse lightly in the presence of such snow-white purity,&#xD;
and he gulped down his coffee and retired, painfully conscious of&#xD;
his large-handed awkwardness, and ashamed of his wicked'&#xD;
thoughts ; and did not come back to get change for the V which'&#xD;
Miss Brandon. dropped into her bank, with a grateful bow.&#xD;
But the Geraldine look would come into her- eyes when she&#xD;
glanced across to the long table, where the three friends were chat-&#xD;
ting and laughing, supported by more beaux than she thought&#xD;
good for them; not but she had plenty-Jan Vedder never left&#xD;
her side except to fetch and carry for her like a silly puppy;&#xD;
Cymbalius Adolphus maneuvered his crush hat, and put on his&#xD;
nose-nippers, and said "ma foiL" and propounded innumerable&#xD;
conundrums; and George Blair came and stood there also, with&#xD;
folded arms, and looked over the crowd with about as much inter-&#xD;
est in their comings and goings as the, stately obelisk takes in&#xD;
the caravans which wind about its base. He smiled good-natur-&#xD;
edly 'when Belle spoke to him, and undid his arms and helped her&#xD;
withthe coffee when- she desired, him, and then returned again&#xD;
into silence and his far-off contemplations.&#xD;
Belle could no more help;studying those who. approached her,&#xD;
than she could refrain'from drawing the fragrant breath which&#xD;
lifted her snowy robe ; picking out the ludicrous from their atti-'&#xD;
tudes and behavior, and slyly enjoying her favorite amusement,&#xD;
which she called quizzing, and which made the, victims writhe&#xD;
without always being conscious what hurt them; playing skill-&#xD;
fully upon their vanity, self-love, and other small weaknesses;&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITil'S DAUGHTER.             493&#xD;
and she never looked so joyously childish, so bewitchingly simple&#xD;
as when thus occupied.&#xD;
Dulcet was prancing abbut the hall, leaning ostentatiously upon&#xD;
the arm of her betrothed, inspecting the tables, discoursing in&#xD;
polysyllables, and watching the sales with great interest, provok-&#xD;
-nk&#xD;
ngly wide-awake and happy. She released 'her gallant escort a&#xD;
moment, to pick up a meerschaum from Sabrina's table, and task&#xD;
the price in a mysterious whisper ; and while Sabrina and she&#xD;
talked with their heads together, naughty Chandy took the oppor-&#xD;
tunity to inquire--&#xD;
"Well, Captain, how do you like it as far as you have got?"&#xD;
"She's as prompt as a lVMajor, Goldsmith," replied the Captain,&#xD;
confidingly, "and as spry as a Jerusalem cricket, and well worth&#xD;
the money I've put in the pool; consequently you can hold your&#xD;
bosses, sir, and let her quilt."&#xD;
The Captain was gotten up with elaborate. care, and had dyed&#xD;
his whiskers, as well as the skin beneath them, so that he ap-&#xD;
peared to a close observer to have a birth-mark on either cheek,&#xD;
of .a neat chestnut brown. He took -such tremendous care of&#xD;
Dulcet that her cork-screws were all of. a quiver with youthful&#xD;
animation, and he stepped about so grand, with his toes out, and&#xD;
his stiff collar sawing his ears, that Belle felt the most intense&#xD;
amusement, and considered the pair a shining mark ; besides, what&#xD;
business had such a faded old creature as Miss Dulcet, whose.life&#xD;
had been all hard lines, to look so satisfied.&#xD;
Belle left her table and floated up to the couple, all dimples&#xD;
and snowy muslin, and crossed her two rosy hands over Dulcet's&#xD;
long, slim, white one, which rested on the Captain's arm, and put&#xD;
up her face close to his, brushing his coat sleeve with her floating&#xD;
locks, exhaling her perfumed breath in a soft sigh:&#xD;
"I'm so tired, Dulcet, and you look too happy, you people ; it&#xD;
is quite time to dissolve the spell. I must have her a minute, Cap-&#xD;
tain, she is manager, you knw, and has duties; so don't break&#xD;
your heart at the absence, just one minute, and no more."&#xD;
The Captain squirmed uneasily under Belle's eyes, and made&#xD;
a remark on the habits of Jerusalem crickets, which was so mixed&#xD;

as to be unintelligible, and Belle linked her arm .into Dulcet's&#xD;
and drew her away.&#xD;
"Uere are these nice hats,".said sheconffidentially, taking up&#xD;
a couple of ;crotcheted eats, with vast brims and no crowns to&#xD;
speak of,. and as stiff and white as limestone, which were the won-&#xD;
drous handiwork of old Miss Pettengill. -" I'm really troubled&#xD;
over them. :I fear they will not sell. She will be wretched&#xD;
about it, and she's a nice old creature. Suppose you and I were&#xD;
just to put.them on, and wear.themfor a few minutes; your feat-&#xD;
ures are so exceedingly delicate, that you can bear .the style better&#xD;
than any of us. I really don't know another girl in the room&#xD;
that I would:ask to help me show them off."&#xD;
Dulcet simpered, and felt buttered, but she said, doubtfully,&#xD;
"Won't .Captain Slocum-he's so pufficly fastigious."&#xD;
"Oh, nonsense, Miss Pettibone. You're not going to let him&#xD;
breathe for you I hope,, and such stores of learning as you have !&#xD;
You know quite well that we are all afraid of yous; absurd !"&#xD;
While she talked, Belle placed one of the wonderful.fabrica-&#xD;

t in admiring rapture.&#xD;
"Is'nt it rather--stiff?",askedMiss Dulcet, rolling up her eyes&#xD;
at the brim, and placing a timid forefinger upon its unyielding&#xD;

If we only had some of those marvelous pink bows under{the&#xD;
chin, which you wore upon your riding hat, I could'nt :answer for&#xD;
Captain Slocum's peace of mind. -Diamonds would'nt save him.&#xD;
.ositively, you; rpst have .it for a garden hat to wear on your&#xD;
lawn,,you know, when you walk after dinner with your hus-&#xD;
band, and .look at your pigs.;,come now, let's make a tour of the&#xD;
hall."&#xD;
"But why don't you don yours. I can't appear alone, the blaze&#xD;
of  so many admiring, eyes will.kill me. I'm so pufficly fastigions."&#xD;
"Oh don't think I shall let you carry off all the smiles. Could&#xD;
not be so disinterested. You must save a small  share for poor&#xD;
little, ne."  telle swung:.the hat into{the top, of her curls and&#xD;
&#xD;
looked like a beautiful peasant going . Maying, . and leaning;on&#xD;
Dulcet's arm, she:sailed =through ,the -hall- with ,downreast face,&#xD;
her veiled ey s swimming in fun, which drew up the corners .of&#xD;
her ripe mouth ,in a bewitching bow. ,,Chandy:espied them first,&#xD;
and stood stock still, gazing in-astonishment,,and Cabby stuck-on&#xD;
his nose nipper and struck an -attitude,,and;old Miss .Pettengil, for&#xD;
whom Dulcet's movements seemed to have a peculiar fascination,&#xD;
nudged Mrs.:Hitchcock.&#xD;
"Well! if that creator ain't peculiar., My:!how folks ean."&#xD;
Chandy stopped them. "By Jove, Miss Dulcet,,you look as&#xD;
dignified as a:toad Sunder a cabbage leaf," said;he.&#xD;
" Come away from that pest," whispered Belle, "let us stand&#xD;
together at mytable, in.a picturesque way, and.you'll soon see how&#xD;
much attention, we shall attract." She threw Chandos such :a queer&#xD;
glance as she floated.on, that he saw through the whole at once.&#xD;
"Wicked little Jezebel," was his mental comment.  " She's&#xD;
nearly bursting over the guy she's made of -that- poor wisp of a&#xD;
teacher ;" and he followed tosee the end.&#xD;
" Don't let's ask less than five dollars for our hats, we'll get&#xD;
it easily enough."&#xD;
Pretty soon the Captain came up, and stopped, and looked an&#xD;
instant 'before-he gave tongue.&#xD;
" Have the goodness'to explain, ma'am, what you've put your-&#xD;
self under that infernal old frying-pan for."&#xD;
" We want to make them sell," faltered:Dulcet, looking .pained&#xD;
and mortified, "and we placed them upon our heads to bring them&#xD;
into notice."&#xD;
"The hats, you mean, not the heads,"-corrected Belle,Aemurely.&#xD;
" If you want to'get sold, you will do the job fast..enough., I&#xD;
:wonder if you have any idea how.like the northeast corner of a&#xD;
grave yard you look."&#xD;
People passing, caught the sound of the Captain's excited voice,&#xD;
and stopped and gazed at Dulcet and .then at Belle, :and; smiled,&#xD;
and the poor creature began to regrether ;too.ready compliance&#xD;
with Belle's proposition, ht she tried to appear not .to notice.&#xD;

sorry," said the Captain in an aggravated undertone. "I shan't&#xD;
stand being made a laughing stock of, not for the best female school-&#xD;
ma'am goin."&#xD;
".Ha t ha! Captain Slocum," laughed Belle. " I like your&#xD;
style. -I think instant obedience should be the motto of every&#xD;
family. -Of course Dulcet, you must not wear the hat, pretty as&#xD;
itis, after that."&#xD;
" I am accustomed to command morigeration myself, sir, and&#xD;
shall not be ordered by a, man," replied Miss Dulcet with dignity.&#xD;
"Yes you will, by thunder. Take it off or I'll knock it off."&#xD;
Poor Miss Dulcet was very red, and the Captain was redder,&#xD;
and she was in a way to forget the danger of displeasing her&#xD;
choleric friend, and of course could not touch the hat after his&#xD;
last outbreak. She glanced around wondering how many had&#xD;
heard it, and bit her lips and looked obstinate. Belle felt sure&#xD;
they were in for a good quarrel, perhaps a break-off, and ex-&#xD;
pected to see the Captain make his threat good.&#xD;
Chandy interfered, saying, " Miss Dulcet, allow me," he lifted&#xD;
the hat from her head with a polite how, and put it on his own,&#xD;
all on one side like a Bowery swell, and stuck his tliumbs in his&#xD;
vest.&#xD;
" What's the price, Belle," asked he. " I'm making up relics,"&#xD;
" Twenty dollars, sir," replied Belle, easily, opening her rosy&#xD;
palm for the money.&#xD;
" Very well done. Don't tell of me Dulcet, 'how I was cozened&#xD;
by the way,' and lost all my money, but only say, ' there are coz-&#xD;
eners abroad, therefore it behoves men to be wary.' Please,&#xD;
ifopsa, to invest that in ' moral pocket handkerchers,' and keep&#xD;
one as a souveneir, and for your private reading."&#xD;
"I'll take'your's, Miss Brandon," said Jan Vedder, not to be&#xD;
outdone in generosity. "And I'll never forget whose lovely head&#xD;
it has adorned."&#xD;
" Ah, poor Jan," sighed Chandy, patting his shoulder, " that's&#xD;
what the matter is, or any.other man."&#xD;
" I wish' you would order half a dozen more, Miss Brandon,&#xD;
we must all have some, capital for fishing," said Sam, laughing.-&#xD;
&#xD;
. "Motley's the only wear, you see, Captain."  Chandy put his&#xD;
arm within the Captain's and lead'hirn off and pinned him, against&#xD;
the wall, and stood.in front of him with a hand on either shoulder,&#xD;
and shook him softly while he lectured him.&#xD;
"Now Captain," (in an affecting and impressive manner,) ".I&#xD;
am older than you, and ever so much wiser, and upon my word,&#xD;
I am surprised at you. You must not speak to such a fine crea-&#xD;
ture -as Miss =Dulcet in that abrupt way. Why inari, we= all look&#xD;
up to her with the- vastest respect. What she does not know is&#xD;
not worth knowing ; an ornament to society, and if she conde-&#xD;
scends to smile. on you, you are honored ; besides Captain, you&#xD;
can't break a woman as you would a mustang."&#xD;
The contrast between Chandy and the Captain, in their respec-&#xD;
tive positions, was ludicrous in the extreme, and the Captain&#xD;
seemed-to feel and enjoy it in a dry way. "You're a pert young&#xD;
rooster," said he, laughing, "but you're about half right. I&#xD;
did'nt ought to blow at her. I hav'nt paid the Parson for her&#xD;
head yet, and till I do, I've no business to have much to say ; but&#xD;
did'nt she look like sixty in that machine."&#xD;
" No, I should say not more than half that, settled .and, digni-&#xD;
fied; better go and make it up, Captain."&#xD;
"Think so ?" asked the Captain, looking across at her, out of&#xD;
the corner of his eye. " She won't expect any great come down&#xD;
will she? could'nt go down on my knees no, how ; spoil my&#xD;
breeches, besides, if we are going to Work in harness, she's got&#xD;
to understand that the gray mare can't be the better horse in my&#xD;
team."&#xD;
" Oh certainly, Captain. She has good sense as well as learn-&#xD;
ing, no nonsense, or woman's rights about her."&#xD;
4 Make a fine looking old lady won't she, Chandos,? bear fat-&#xD;
ting up, good feed and a warm stable, that's my way."&#xD;
"That's it, Captain, that's the basis. Now don't waste the&#xD;
minutes."&#xD;
" But Chandy," said these Captain, playing off, "I guess I won't&#xD;
be in a hurry,'she'll keep; let's talk about breaking horses a spell:&#xD;
I can tell" you a thing or, two about; that. They used to bring&#xD;

them to me off the other ranches, so fierce that t'would take&#xD;
two men to hold 'em, and I'd let them out as gentle as Jerusalem'&#xD;
crickets. Now my way was this, (he let' go. of Chandy's but-&#xD;
ton, and struck his forefinger into hig palm, and forgot all about&#xD;
Miss Dulcet in his ardor for his favorite theme.)  You take a&#xD;
wild mare and tie ip her fore leg, :and show her the halter, and-&#xD;
whisper to her, and let her feel the bit, and she'll soon know your&#xD;
hand, and come and lick it. I never touch a-whip to 'en. Why,&#xD;
LordI Chandy, they used to follow me all around the pen-"  -&#xD;
".Exactly," cut in. Chandy, trying to look grave. "That is&#xD;
science. You try that method on Miss Dulcet, and you'll find it&#xD;
will work like magic.".&#xD;
"Well, I believe I will, haw, haw! You young scalawag, I'll&#xD;
go now.".&#xD;
As Captain Slocutn was a real whole hearted good fellow, and,&#xD;
liked Miss Dulcet, he was man enough to go directly to her and-&#xD;
ask her pardon. She had seated herself forlornly in the corner,'&#xD;
and was too deeply grieved at her own folly to need much coaxing,&#xD;
and a few words made it all right, and her poor lonely old heart&#xD;
warmedup with real affection for the honest man who spoke such&#xD;
good words even if he was a something rough, and their chances of&#xD;
happiness together were not lessened by Belle's little amusement.&#xD;
As soon. -as Chandos saw the Captain safely under way, he&#xD;
turned gaily off to Miss Belle, who murmured "tiresome cock-&#xD;
atoo !" anddarted a vicious look at him, which dissolved like magic&#xD;
into a. merry smile, as she caught his eye. She had occupied'&#xD;
herself in studying Miss Dulcet, pricking her with aggravating&#xD;
consolations, till the poor creature could stand no more, and- was&#xD;
fain tw retire and hide her tears.&#xD;
Chandy took out his handkerchief andflourished it, and wiped&#xD;
his face and fanned it, asif reduced to the last stage of exhaus-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
" Mopsa Pandora, give me a cup of coffee," said he faintly, I&#xD;
am as dry as dust, with mollifying the Captain ; patching up your&#xD;
work, repairing your wickedness. I don't know but it is my duty&#xD;
and mission to marry you andget you out of the way. Certain-&#xD;
ly you are as beautiful as a butterfly, and as industrious as a bee."&#xD;
&#xD;
" Oh, thank you, sir, what a pretty, compliment, though I don't&#xD;
know what you have seen of my labors to deserve it$ unless you&#xD;
refer to the Fair. I flatter myself this is rather a brilliant suc-&#xD;
cess. I've been faithful over a few things. My Mary Ann for&#xD;
one; but when we speak of beauty, the charming anecdote you&#xD;
did me the honor to relate on that topic is yet fresh in my&#xD;
memory."&#xD;
" That is as it should be: but iKopsa Pondora, I shall, not marry,&#xD;
you for your looks, but that I may direct your industry into its&#xD;
proper channel to keep your idle hands from the work which that&#xD;
old fellow behind you is cutting out for them. (Belle threw an&#xD;
involuntary glance over her shoulder, as Chandy pointed, and&#xD;
could have slapped him for getting her to do it.)  I feel that I&#xD;
need some absorbing occupation which shall be almost too much&#xD;
for me. Therefore speak, or forever hold your peace. You&#xD;
know you and Fate fixed it up among the daisies. Give me time&#xD;
to swallow my coffee, and then I'll spread my handkerchief and go&#xD;
down on my knees."&#xD;
Belle put on a touching expression, and offered the cup with&#xD;
sad tender grace.. "Take it Mr. Goldsmith, I may say. Dear&#xD;
Chandy. If I could only give you the boon you seek, as.readily&#xD;
as this fragrant tipple! but you make:it my painful duty to say the&#xD;
fatal no, to your very kind.offer. The highest compliment a man&#xD;
can offer to a woman. (I say man prospectively of course.)  I&#xD;
feel for you. I should like to be tied to you a couple of weeks&#xD;
well enough, but for a life time, 'lllafoi! celafait dresser les&#xD;
cheveax a la tete.' It may be my vocation to lead apes, but I am&#xD;
in no hurry. To quote from your favorite author whom I've been&#xD;
studying up on purpose to converse with you, 'I'd rather eat&#xD;
cheese and garlic in a windmill, than live in a summer house with&#xD;
you.'- And besides, what would pretty mistress Bertha say, if she&#xD;
knew you had been making mad love to me. It rather strikes&#xD;
me Mr. Goldsmith needs a watcher, but I won't tell. I pledge&#xD;
you my word.-. Now.don\tsgo and hang yourself, don't, forgive me,&#xD;

She held out her hand with one of her wicked smiles, and&#xD;
Chandy looked extremely silly. He was taken aback for'once in&#xD;
his life, and Billy Shakes could not, save him. - He had before&#xD;
tried to stop, her voluble utterances by muttering something about&#xD;
being in joke, which did not help his plight any, and now Belle&#xD;
dropped him a curtesy.&#xD;
" In my new character of .oMpsa Pandora, I should like to,&#xD;
chant a little ditty to you before I go." While Chandy's gaze was&#xD;
fixed on her face, in the twinkling of an eye, it underwent a change.&#xD;
" For sweet charity ! kind friends.!" she said,,.in plaintive accents,&#xD;
which served to arrest the steps of a knot of gentlemen. In a,&#xD;
soft contralto, she chanted just loud enough for those -close about&#xD;
her to catch the clear liquid notes:&#xD;
"This youth was fair and tender,&#xD;
And begged of me to wed,&#xD;
But he's much too fond of a bender,&#xD;
Nay ! better lead apes, I said."&#xD;
Swinging off her hat she held it out. " Give to a poor girl,&#xD;
gentlemen. Starving is a fearful death to die. I was as well&#xD;
raised as you, and hav'nt always sung for my bread. Pity me,&#xD;
sirs."  She turned her-face aside, and coughed a regular church-&#xD;
yard cough, and actually her features got pinched and pale, her&#xD;
eyes threw wild dlespairing glances around, and she staggered,&#xD;
and held up by the table. The group looked uneasily at her, and&#xD;
as-if under a spell, they threw money into the hat. She paused&#xD;
before Chandy. "For sweet charity, sir," and Chandy's hand&#xD;
fumbled in his pocket, and-drew out a handful of change which&#xD;
he put in without taking his eyes off her.&#xD;
"Many thanks, gentlemen. Indeed it it a good cause."  She&#xD;
laughed merrily and bowed, her .face changing back to dimples&#xD;
and, archness. " Au revoir, Mr. Goldsmith," she added, turning her&#xD;
back upon the others, and speaking low. "I think we are quits&#xD;
now. I am of opinion I did that very nicely,. every bit as well as&#xD;
May Edwards. - I think sometimes I'll try the stage, just for the&#xD;
excitement of the life." With sweeping grace she sailed off, and&#xD;
&#xD;
put her hand on George's arm, who stood, leaning absently against&#xD;
a pillar, and watching Ruth, with grave, sad intentness. She was&#xD;
talking in a loud voice, with quick utterances and vivacious laugh-&#xD;
ter, the center of. the group about the round table, where Christa-&#xD;
bel and Otho were standing.&#xD;
"Jupiter, what a stunning girl that is, Knox! Who do you&#xD;
suppose she is ? I've a great mind to stop over on purpose to&#xD;
pony up to her."&#xD;
" And so be too late for the race ; no Nickson, no such noi-&#xD;
sense as that. I've a blamed deal too much at stake, though I&#xD;
know you're just fool enough to do it; but I shan't leave you be-&#xD;
hind."&#xD;
" But she's such a spirited little filley. 'Gad ! how she man-&#xD;
aged her face. I hav'nt seen such a pair of eyes since Nora's&#xD;
time."&#xD;
" She's an ugly devil, or I miss my guess. If she don't murder&#xD;
somebody it'll be because she drops off too quick to finish the&#xD;
job. She's got a savage inside of her, if I'm any judge. . Come&#xD;
on, we shall be late for the train."&#xD;
" Oh I shall go, since you badger so about it; but I'll see her&#xD;
again: when my blood jumps like that it means something. If&#xD;
she's a savage, all the better."&#xD;
"Very well, as often as you like and she'll consent to; though&#xD;
I've a notion you'll come to grief if you do. There ! wasn't that&#xD;
the whistle ?"&#xD;
The talkers were horsey, turfy looking sports, and they left-the&#xD;
hall as they had come in, together. But they left also a pile of&#xD;
bills in Belle's hat, which I suppose she put into the wooden bank&#xD;
on her coffee-table.&#xD;
In the meantime George had freed himself from  Belle, and&#xD;
walked away, being in no mood to-night for her blandishments ;&#xD;
and Bertha and-she stood together, when Dame Williams bustled&#xD;
up to her.&#xD;
"Brandon, don't you think it is about time to variagate the ex-&#xD;
ercises with our post-office ?  The folks are pretty nigh 'as thick&#xD;
as they will be."  She always called her Brandon when she&#xD;

wished to be pa t icularly stylish.  She heard some traveling&#xD;
singers address each other by their surnames' at.Savin roek and&#xD;
thought' it 'sounded fine.&#xD;
" Certainly, Williams," replied Belle, making a wry face to&#xD;
Bertha, who could not help laughing; "'as soon as you like. lie&#xD;
is all ready to come -in."&#xD;
" Well, you go and start him up, and take your place, post&#xD;
mortem."-&#xD;
'When I enter the next sphere post mortem, I shall not be&#xD;
post mistress," said Belle as she sailed away.&#xD;
" What did Brandon refer to? I 'did'nt seem to sense her,"&#xD;
asked Mrs. Williams.&#xD;
Bertha was spared the trouble of explaining, for a tremendous&#xD;
" toot, toot ! toodle too," sounded in their ears, and arrested the&#xD;
talking, and turned all eyes to-the door.&#xD;
" Act first, scene first," said Chandy. " Enter a king and two&#xD;
trumpeters."&#xD;
The three were all comprised in the person of Jan Vedder, who&#xD;
came pushing in, elaborately gotten up in shaggy overcoat,'Cali-&#xD;
fornia hat, vast neck-tie, horseman's boots, carrying a fearful whip&#xD;
over his shoulder, and dragging in his wake a real mailbag, bor-&#xD;
rowed from Uncle Sam for the occasion: and performing at iater-&#xD;
vals, with excruciating effect, upon the tin horn.&#xD;
"Very good, Vedder, very good indeed; quite English, ex-&#xD;
tremely like a real guard."&#xD;
" Thank you, Cabby," replied Jan, who knew 'England thorough-&#xD;
ly, all its highways and by-ways; (lazy merry-hearted vagabond&#xD;
that he was, he did the rambling tour on foot and in lively com-&#xD;
pany.)  " But you are clouded in a little mistake. - This is the&#xD;

and came mighty near leaving the bag and. my bones under the&#xD;

Everybody fell back, laughing and applauding, and the over-&#xD;

land disappeared within a green baize apartment, having a square&#xD;
hole for a window, at which Miss:Brandon's charming ,head was&#xD;
visible, arrayed in a neat little frilled -cap and jaunty ribbons, a&#xD;
pair of steel spectacles across her pretty nose, without any glasses,&#xD;
and her shoulders covered with a scarlet cloak: all ready to offi-&#xD;
ciate with busy zeal as post mistress. Her bands were. full of&#xD;
letters, which she presented with lively grace. Of course each'&#xD;
victim was obliged to accept his- missive, amidst much laughter&#xD;
and joking, and hand up the postage.&#xD;
"Letter from Patagonia, for Deacon Williams; very thick and&#xD;
heavy ; is doubtless a request for the immediate establishment of&#xD;
a Gonecusset branch among the enterprising natives, who are, as&#xD;
the little boy said who learned his answer for one and got :the&#xD;
wrong question-' Who settled America?' asked the, teacher; 'ser-&#xD;
pents and alligators of an enormous size 1' spoke lup the boy.&#xD;
Here it is, deacon."&#xD;
The worthy man, who had been looking on enjoying the scene,&#xD;
and had rallied his conferees and advised them . to " pay up,"&#xD;
~rather wilted now, and laughed the other side of his mouth, and&#xD;
made no show of approaching till pushed forward by those around&#xD;
him.&#xD;
" For the good of the Chuich, deacon ! feed the hungry and&#xD;
clothe the naked," whispered Zoe.&#xD;
He- fumbled his wallet awhile, but finally handed up -the five&#xD;
dollars, which was the regular postage upon Patagonia letters, and&#xD;
he, stood twirling the packet in his fingers, while the Gonecusset's&#xD;
laughed at him.&#xD;
"Sonsie Eagan, you go right away and fetch me that letter.&#xD;
I'm goin to read it."  Mrs. Williams had seen Zoe whisper to&#xD;
the deacon behind her hand, and she knew him too well.&#xD;
"And is it the letter, ma'am!1"  Sonsie had recourse to -her&#xD;
favorite attitude. " And what shall I say to him that :I'll fetch&#xD;
it ?"&#xD;
"Say I want it. Tell im to hand over if he knows what's&#xD;
good for himself. Ill have no getting letters from whisperin&#xD;
mixes.".&#xD;

Dame Williams was very angry and jealous to see the deacon&#xD;
the center of the merry group, chatting, laughing, coaxing him&#xD;
with extended hands. .She knew his weakness for pretty girls,&#xD;
and how easily they could charm away his money. Sonsie pushed&#xD;
her way boldlythrough, and extended her hand with the others.&#xD;
" You're to hand over the letter, sir !"&#xD;
" What do you mean by such impudence !"&#xD;
"Sure 'twas the mistress' self told me to say it," spoke up Son.&#xD;
sic, unabashed. "Ef you' know what's good for yourself she'll&#xD;
have no getting letters from minxes, nor whisperin nather."&#xD;
The deacon slunk away in the roar of laughter which followed,&#xD;
while Sonsie stood still, covering his exit with her eyes, and keep-&#xD;
ing her hand out, though the mischief in her face belied the open&#xD;
candor of her attitude.&#xD;
Meanwhile the. distribution progressed, with various effects&#xD;
upon the recipients. There were the usual amount of platitudes,&#xD;
a good deal of personality, hitting of sore places; but no one&#xD;
could be called to account, for the letters were4all withdrawn from&#xD;
a locked box, which had been four or five days suspended from&#xD;
the church door. The mail was immense, and Belle kept hand-&#xD;
ing out letters from Peru, Egypt, from Abyssinia, from Turkey,&#xD;
and all sorts of distant places. The Roaring Riverites must have&#xD;
been cosmopolitan in their associations. The Gonecusset's had&#xD;
been bled profusely, and the young men began to look blank when&#xD;
they got the third and fourth epistle, and were obliged to .claim it&#xD;
orfeel mean; especially the clerks aid those who could ill afford&#xD;
the out-lay. Church fairs are merciless. Once in, you can no&#xD;
more hope to get out than you could from the maelstrom. They&#xD;
spin you round till they empty your pockets ; the last farthing&#xD;
has got to. come,' especially with beau-tiful Brandon's for sales-&#xD;
women.,&#xD;
Mr. Growing was standing back in the hall with George Blair:&#xD;
companions, though each was silently thinking; when the pastor&#xD;
heard his name called out, and' Chandy came up with a letter,- on&#xD;
which he had paid the foreign postage, and handed it to him. He&#xD;
took it with a smile, and tore it open..&#xD;
&#xD;
"I had no idea I should be favored by the Patagonians," said&#xD;
he. A look first of surprise, then of grief, spread  over his face,&#xD;
where the care lines were deep already. He handed it to George&#xD;
with a-sigh.&#xD;
"I did not know I had an enemy in my parish."&#xD;
" Enemies !" returned George, with a bitter laugh. "Easy&#xD;
enough to find enemies, but friends ! search for them with .a light-&#xD;
ed candle ;" and he added to himself, " a man's foes are they of&#xD;
his own household."&#xD;
"Ef you wood leve of succolatin subscriptions and mind your&#xD;
preachin, and also ef your wife wood leve of dressin quite so fine&#xD;
and playin on the music all the while, and du a little work, your&#xD;
pot wood bile faster."&#xD;
"The cloven foot sticks out, Fred," said George,-as he handed&#xD;
it back. ."She's of no account anyhow. I should not trouble&#xD;
myself.- Just light your pipe with it and make an end of it""&#xD;
"She, who? Pray do you know' whose is this miserable&#xD;
abuse ?"&#xD;
"There she stands, 'fair, fat, and forty."  He pointed to the&#xD;
deaconess, who was still watching her husband's motions; she&#xD;
thought she detected unusual friskiness in him, whether 'inspired&#xD;
by the atmosphere of youthful jollity he had been inhaling, or&#xD;
three or four glasses of Harmony sherry he -had imbibed with&#xD;
Captain Slocum 'under the rose.' The Captain kept choice&#xD;
wines, and the deacon sometimes partook,,though he was a leader&#xD;
in the temperance movement, and he had spoken only the Sun-&#xD;

pure English.&#xD;
",Impossible, George.. Why, it would take the heart of a 6iger&#xD;
to do such a thing, so; mean, cruel, cowardly."&#xD;
" Well,.she; is ;bout half tiger--a fat tiger; she used to. drag&#xD;

".You are joking, George"&#xD;
"I'm afraid he finds it a. sorry joke, then ;.- he dares not say his&#xD;
soul is his own, if he's got a soul, which I consider doubtful."&#xD;

"George 1" said the young preacher, reproachfully.&#xD;
George laughed without any mirth. " Oh well, Fred, you need&#xD;
not be in any doubt about your letter, she wrote it fast enough,; she's&#xD;
forgotten her spelling-book, and adopts th6 phonographic method,&#xD;
but the spirit and the orthography both declare the authorship."&#xD;
"But she is a firm friend of ours; she patronizes my wife,"&#xD;
said Mr. Growing, with a half-smile.&#xD;
"I can't credit such a phenomenon as her feeling friendship for&#xD;
anybody except Mrs. Deacon Williams. Have they approved&#xD;
your building scheme ?"&#xD;
"He did second me warmly, and put down a header of a thou-&#xD;
sand, but afterwards he turned cold."&#xD;
" That's it, she keel-hauled him, and forbade the gift. He's a&#xD;
curious old file; runs the church; half the wood burnt there&#xD;
comes from his pile, and the oil from his barrel; but you have&#xD;
any dealings with him and you may know that you are a gimlet&#xD;
if he don't get the best of you; he fleeces his workmen system-&#xD;
atically."&#xD;
"Why George, old friend, you rail like a kate ; it sounds oddly&#xD;
enough, such talk fromyou. I thought all your clouds had silver&#xD;
linings."&#xD;
"Oh well, Fred, you call these men christians; you pull in&#xD;
harness with them; a set of twisting knaves, all tricks and&#xD;
sharp bargains on the week-days, and praying saints on Sun-&#xD;
day.' Upon my word, I wouldn't trust them with the contribution&#xD;
box without counting the pennies first. Things are something&#xD;
mired in this world, I think."  George passed his hand through'&#xD;
his hair with a weary gesture.&#xD;
"Dear friend,.it pains me to hear you talk in this strain; come,&#xD;
it isn't so very many years since you and I slept in the' same bed&#xD;
in that old barn of a dormitory, and. I used to help you with your&#xD;
particles then; n w I. want your assistance. Come into. the&#xD;
church, George; put. your shoulder to .the wheel, 'tis a powerful&#xD;
one ; bring your brain and muscle into - the right work. You'd&#xD;
make a glorious worker ! do, friend of gmy boyhood."&#xD;
"Why, Fred, do you recognize in me one of the elect? alas,&#xD;
&#xD;
old fellow, I'm farther off than ever ;" George laughed. "The&#xD;
Methody parson wants me, too; begs of me to 'come out,' but&#xD;
his creed don't seem to fit my-case, because, as Byron says, '-even&#xD;
the most righteous may get a slip in his faith which shall throw&#xD;
him on his back like- a skater, while gliding smoothly on to his&#xD;
paradise.'"&#xD;
"It is a very pretty beginning of faith in a man to believe in&#xD;
his wife," said Mr. Growing, smiling into George's 'eyes, as if&#xD;
certain of an answering kindly glow.&#xD;
But George -colored, and looked away off, and stood silent.&#xD;
Presently he said :&#xD;
"Fred, may I advise you? I have never felt myself worthy, to&#xD;
take the place you"offer me ; less than ever now, and I need&#xD;
counsel, more than you can possibly imagine ; counsel which no&#xD;
one can give me."&#xD;
Mr. Growing looked surprised, and was about to speak ; he&#xD;
fancied that his friend's eyes were humid, and his voice certainly&#xD;
trembled, who hurried on:&#xD;
" Don't try to get a new church ; you'll have to go through fire&#xD;
and water to compass it, and if you succeed, which is doubtful,&#xD;
you will not stay to preach in it. Even now they are at work in&#xD;
an underhanded plot; this letter is a sample of it."&#xD;
Mr. Growing was thoughtful a few minutes. - It may be so;&#xD;
but that does-not alter in the least my plain duty. I shall go on;&#xD;
we need a new church, and we must have it, and Deo volente, we&#xD;
will have it. The bats dwell in the crevices, wasps build, and spi-&#xD;
ders spin; mould and damp festoon the walls, the whole concern is&#xD;
a disgrace and it has got to come down ! I shall stay to see a good"&#xD;
solid church edifice rise from its ruins, even if I have to pack off.&#xD;
the day of its completion. 1:can find a field elsewhere; my Father&#xD;
will give me work enough to do, while I stay, and I -shall not.&#xD;
have to run about and hunt it, either, and my successor shall. find&#xD;
a temple suitable for the worship of the living God."&#xD;
"Of such stuff were the martyrs made," said George, looking&#xD;
at his friend's flushed face with a loving gaze.&#xD;

You think me an enthusiast in church architecture," said the&#xD;
m nister, smiling ; "but I don't mind your laughing at me."&#xD;
"You always were, an enthusiast, Fred. Does it ever strike&#xD;
you oddly that you and I, after drifting apart so widely, should&#xD;
float together again in this nook of the earth, which wasn't down&#xD;
on our map of the world in those times? I was'a rich man's son,&#xD;
then."&#xD;
"I remember the day when the news came to school of the&#xD;
great change in your fortunes. I was the only one you.would let&#xD;
near you."&#xD;
"It knocked me flat for awhile, didn't it, Fred? but I got over&#xD;
it ;. I'm a jolly blacksmith now."&#xD;
Mr. Growing looked earnestly at him; he wondered where the&#xD;
jollity had gone, and he was turning it over in his mind when Sam&#xD;
Slaughton come up, holding out a handful of letters.&#xD;
" You are in luck, Mr. Growing, and the best of the joke is,&#xD;
they are all paid. Here is one for you, Blair-only a dime ; the&#xD;
powers that be are more merciful than to us fellows; we've had&#xD;
to smoke for our correspondence.",&#xD;
" Poh, a pack of follies !" said George, impatiently, handing&#xD;
out his dime, and pocketing the epistle without even looking at it.&#xD;
"Why did you touch them, Fred ?" he laid his hand upon Mr.&#xD;
Growing's shoulder, whose face was crimson and then pale, indig.&#xD;
nant; and sorrowful by turns. " It is treacherous cruelty, a stab-&#xD;
in the dark; burn them, old fellow."&#xD;
Mr. Growing's enemies had made the post'office the vehicle of&#xD;
conveying to him, their sentiments. He had invitations to resign,&#xD;
hits on his person and ministry, his private life. He folded them&#xD;
all together after perusing them,&#xD;
" I will file these away among my valuable papers , we can&#xD;
learn from what our enemies say of us our true characters, and I&#xD;
will take occasion to look carefully into my life. But I shall not&#xD;
resign, nor will I be dismissed till my work is finished. I'll build&#xD;
my church in spite of them, and they shall help.'&#xD;
"Got any letters, George ? asked Chandy, who came sauntering&#xD;
up, with his hands full.. " I think I have offered up about a score&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW    GOLDS3I 'S DAUGHTER.              5O9&#xD;
of dollars on the altar of the ' orphlings ;' Sam  more, and Jan is&#xD;

clares he enjoys it. You ought to have one, at least ; I must go&#xD;
and, see about it. I shouldn't wonder if you was sent out to man-&#xD;
age the Patagonian branch of the Gonecusset Scythe Works."&#xD;
"I think I did get a letter; what did I-oh, here it is," pro-&#xD;
ducing it in a very crumpled condition from his pocket.  Smooth-&amp;amp;&#xD;
ing it out, his eyes fell upon the address, and a great change&#xD;
passed over his face ; he crushed it in his hand, and strode away&#xD;
abruptly.  In the tenantless end of the hall, away from     the.&#xD;
crowd, he paused beneath a lamp and tore it open. It ran thus:&#xD;
MY FIRST AND ONLY -LOVE :,&#xD;
Oh, why did you come again in my way ? I was tranquil and con-&#xD;
tented, and learning to forget. I shall not get a divorce ; you are mad to&#xD;
propose it to m. No, Otho, I shall go on till my heart breaks; I think it&#xD;
will not be long  I am glad you are to leave me, but I pray that I may see&#xD;
you once more before I die, When iny weary life is done,.and I am going to&#xD;
my rest, I hope it will not be wicked for you to hold me in your arms then ;&#xD;
don't let any other face come between; let me die looking in your eyes,&#xD;
holding your hand. Now go ! this is my farewell, I shall not see you in&#xD;
the morning ; I could not, with prying eyes upon us. Leave me with my&#xD;
noble husband, who is so kind and good. Poor fellow ! he deserves better.&#xD;
If only I had never seen you, darling, I might have loved him, but I cannot&#xD;
wish that; I Will try to be loyal to him. Dear, dearest Otho, tempt me no&#xD;
no more; the bitterness of death is past. Farewell.&#xD;
George drew his band across his eyes twice or thrice, to clear&#xD;
them from the gathering mists, then he looked once more at the&#xD;
address, "Mr. George Blair," in tiny characters, and he read} the&#xD;
letter through again. It was Ruth's writing, dLear, fine, sharp,&#xD;
every letter perfect ; he knew it well, and had kissed the pretty'&#xD;
characters a thousand times ; and now he seemed- to see as in a&#xD;
vision, the flitting shadows of an October afternoon, and to hear&#xD;
the tinkling water dropping, dropping, at Petrifying Springs and&#xD;
to be sitting on the moss, planning and shaping his model; Ruth's&#xD;
open letter before him:&#xD;
"My Darling,-Only three days more and I shall be yours;&#xD;

when. this tardy sun goes down Ishallsee you. Oh! what have&#xD;
I done that I should be so happy"&#xD;
His eyes fell upon the letter in his hand: "Dear Otho, let me&#xD;
die in your arms."  The, sweet vision melted; his model was&#xD;
completed, and had passed out, of his; hands ; his happiness was&#xD;
finished, and had vanishedFfrom his heart. The giant staggered&#xD;
and reeled, and clutched at they pine branches for support; they&#xD;
yielded to his touch, and dropped away from him. The voices&#xD;
smote upon his' shattered sense like the mad t noise of Roaring-&#xD;
River. A clear tone melted into his ear:&#xD;
You are deeply meditating, Mr. Blair; you look as wrapt as&#xD;
Ezekiel on the hillttop."&#xD;
George stooped slowly and picked up the letter which had flut-&#xD;
tered to his feet. He smiled ; it would have made you chilly to&#xD;
see such a smile-so cold, so wintry. " The bitterness of death&#xD;
is passed," said he. Without once looking at his questioner, he&#xD;
walked ;slowly away. " The bitterness of death is passed, but&#xD;
that cannot well be, since life remains, which is all bitterness.&#xD;
Poor Ruthie, poor child; I have foreseen how it must end ; -she&#xD;
is but a tender flower. I have all the strength, I must battle with&#xD;
life, not she."&#xD;
Belle Brandon watched him disappear. " What would I give&#xD;
for such a man's love. Yielding to such a master, I might make&#xD;
an average domestic machine. Poh ! what a fool I am ! what is&#xD;
love to me?  Better Jan Vedder, Cymbalius Adolphus, yes, or&#xD;
old Soapfut, rich, than that demi-god, poor. But .how wretched&#xD;
and broken he looked ! I wonder if I don't pity* him?  I hear&#xD;
people talk about pity, but I am not sure I ever felt the emotion."&#xD;
Ruth Blair had - been "standing round doin'.nothin'," as Mrs.&#xD;
Williams indignantly observed,, all the evening, taking no part&#xD;
in the labor, or interesting the sales; she was listless and ab-&#xD;
sent, or if observed, she would immediately be so gay and viva-&#xD;
cious as to excite the wonder of herfriends. .,Sonsie watched her&#xD;
leaning upon Otho's arm, talking with hito at the, cream-table,&#xD;
and again in the recess which was set off as the "fortune bower,"&#xD;
where Adeliza Euphemia questioned fate for twenty-five cents a&#xD;
lead.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was not half over yet, and Ruth wag tired of it all, but she&#xD;
could not go away ; her mind was in a'tumult, and she' leaned her&#xD;
face against'the cool window, and looked out ito the night, shel-&#xD;
tered by the young pine trees which had been impressed into the&#xD;
service of the Fair, and which served to sustain the hanging lamps.&#xD;
Cymbalius Adolphus called out close beside her, at the same&#xD;
time hooking Sam and Peter by a button-hole apiece:&#xD;
" I say fellas, I've composed a new widdle."&#xD;
"You don't mean it, Cabby ! Don't you feel exhausted ?" They&#xD;
tried to pull away.&#xD;
" But hold on, I'm going to tell it to you.- Half the fun of&#xD;
making widdles is telling them to your friends. I made it just&#xD;
now," pointing over to George Blair, who was listening to Belle&#xD;
Brandon, she standing close to him and looking up in his face and&#xD;
I speaking eagerly. " Why is that Blair fellah not like a galley-&#xD;
slave ?"&#xD;
"For several reasons, I should say, Cabby ; but you will have&#xD;
to, explain your point, I can't see it."&#xD;
"'Why, you see he likes the Brand-on, and the galley fellahs&#xD;
don't like it. Very neat, isn't it ?"&#xD;
" Did you do that all yourself, Cabby, upon honor, now ?"&#xD;
"Ma foi, yes;' I'm always making them, but they are not all&#xD;
so good as this one. You see the Blair fellah adores the Brandon."&#xD;
"I advise you not to fulminate your riddle too near the Blair&#xD;
fellah's ears, because he's got a gorgeous pair of fists, hits straight&#xD;
out, and. you'll find yourself sprawling. Let me go now, Cabby,&#xD;
'I'm in a hurry."&#xD;
Ruth's cheeks tingled, and she dropped her head lower, and&#xD;
drew her breath with a sob. It had come to this, then ; even&#xD;
this brainless fool had seen her shame, and made it the theme -of&#xD;
a witless jest. But she had not heard all yet; there was more&#xD;
in store for her.&#xD;
'-I should say that girl was pretty' peculiar," squeaked old Miss&#xD;
Pettengill. "Flow she does go oi with that George Blair. If&#xD;
his wife had the spunk of a flea she'd butter his beans for him; I&#xD;
should admire to catch my husband cutting up such shines."&#xD;

&#xD;
"I know it, Miss Pettengill," chimed in Mrs. Hitchcock ; "why&#xD;
'taint a week since Adelizy Euphemy see 'em walkin' home from&#xD;
the foundry as' chipper as wood-chucks, and he a carrying his hat&#xD;
in his hand as if she was Victory; and I happen to know it want&#xD;
no chance meetin', because my girl watched her all the way up&#xD;
the glen, and seen her go into the foundry, and she stood round&#xD;
and waited for him to wash his face off before he started down."&#xD;
"Well, well, Miss Nitchcock, did you ever. It is a dreadful&#xD;
world, and stands us in hand to have our lamp trimmed and&#xD;
burning ; such temptations as we have, we don't know what we&#xD;
may be left to do; men are so peculiar."&#xD;
" Don't you think somebody ought to warn that Belle Brandon?&#xD;
she's a pretty creatur, and so young and innocent; she and my&#xD;
A.delizy is quite intimate."&#xD;
" Well I must say, sister Pettibone, I'm  glad my Dulcet is&#xD;
going to be married. She'll soon have a man to take care of her,&#xD;
and such a nice, kind, generous creatur; I wish he was a profes-&#xD;
sor. It says 'be ye not unequally yoked together,' but a pious&#xD;
wife can do a great deal."&#xD;
"Your Dulcet ! Law sakes ! you needn't be noways alarmed&#xD;
about her; she's safe enough;" old Miss Pettengill snuffed con-&#xD;
temptuously.&#xD;
Poor Ruth shrank away, and crept out of the hall. As she&#xD;
stood at the door she glanced back, the post-office window was&#xD;
shut, and the people were beginning to go away. She looked&#xD;
about :foi George, he was- nowhere to be seen. Mrs. Deacon&#xD;
Williams and Mrs. John Bisbee were piling up the dishes, and-&#xD;
talking at their work.&#xD;
"What's- she gone home for ?"&#xD;
"She said her head ached."&#xD;
" Don't believe a word on't; she shirks the trouble, and gets off'&#xD;
a walking with that fool that ought to know better."&#xD;
Ruth fitted this conversation on to her thoughts. Itwas Belle&#xD;
who had gone; and with George ; another walk; she would follow&#xD;
and upbraid them-,-no, she would not speak a word to either, but&#xD;
she would take her child and go away and live alone, far from&#xD;
&#xD;
=WIDOW  GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.             513&#xD;
the pity o, people, and their ridicule. But she would e for&#xD;
herself, and they should know that she had seen, and understood.&#xD;
She hastened aloig into the night with hurrying feet, and&#xD;
pressed her hands to her throbbing temples; away before, her she&#xD;
discerned the faint outline of two figures, and thought she saw&#xD;
the flutter of a white robe ; she. quickened her stumbling foot-&#xD;
steps, ran wildly after themn,with her strained eyes fixed in eager&#xD;
watch. A blast of the cool night wind swept.off her round hat,&#xD;
and her loosened hair fell about her face. She parted it eagerly,&#xD;
and ran on without stopping ; her feet tripped over something&#xD;
lying across the walk, and she fell. It was .a man, probably.&#xD;
drunk; she did not.stop to ascertain, did not give him a thought,&#xD;
but rose quickly, still peering into the darkness; the figures had&#xD;
disappeared.&#xD;
She was near the Horse Shoe now, and as she turned the cor-&#xD;
ner a bright light streamed out at her from the window. She smiled&#xD;
bitterly as she thought of the two who were within, and wondered&#xD;
how they would look when she confronted them; jealous people&#xD;
make no account of; probabilities, and with her hand upon the&#xD;
lock she drew in her breath. She burst open the door and dashed&#xD;
in. George was there alone, kneeling" by .Pigeon's crib, with _a&#xD;
picture in his hand,-which he put away in his ,pocket, and he-rais-&#xD;
ed his face, wet with tears, which he made no effort to conceal.&#xD;
"Come here, Ruthie," said he, rising to his feet.' His voice&#xD;
was calm and quiet, but-oh how sad. He held out his hand to&#xD;
her.&#xD;
"Look how sweetly the boy is sleeping ; after a whine he will&#xD;
toss whole hours on his restless bed, and long and pray for rest,&#xD;
for forgetfulness, but it won't come. I've got to speak, Ruthie;&#xD;
the time for silence has passed ; I have been trying' to find out&#xD;
how, here by his crib. We must look each other resolutely in&#xD;
the face, and hear and speak the truth. Do not tremble, poor&#xD;
girl, you need: not fear me.; I am no stern judge."&#xD;
She stood still, her lips curling, her panting breath coming in&#xD;
sobs:from her heaving chest; but she never turned an eyelash&#xD;
toward him.&#xD;

",Will you not come, my Ruth, and let me take your hand ?"&#xD;
She laughed scornfully, and flashed a blazing look at him-&#xD;
"You my judge! and with that picture in your hand, which ,you&#xD;
dared to put to your lips! You have just hidden it out of sight.&#xD;
Don't act astonishment; don't add a lie to the rest of it. I saw&#xD;
you with my eyes."&#xD;
"The picture, Ruth ; do you taunt me with that ? must you&#xD;
not only deny me the love which is dearer than my life, but do&#xD;
you also grudge me a glance at the smiling eyes, the precious lips&#xD;
which have spoken such dear words as will take all my life to&#xD;
foiget.&#xD;
Stop, George! Don't go any farther in that ; I'm trying hard&#xD;
not to despise you. I wonder you can look at me, and you speak&#xD;
of being.a judge to me! and you ask me to come and touch your&#xD;
hand; you think a few pretty speeches,  erhas' a confess&#xD;
prp    cneson or&#xD;
two, will set all right. No, I will not come near you."&#xD;
"Are you mad, Ruth ?" said George, straightening himself, the&#xD;
lnes in his face hardening. " Do you despise. my forbearance?&#xD;
But I will not be angry with you, poor child; you have been&#xD;
greatly tried, you have suffered ; you do not know how wildly you&#xD;
talk, or what you are doing."&#xD;
"Oh yes I do; I know quite well. I am turning my back on&#xD;
a man who has ruined my life, made me a by-word and 'a laugh-&#xD;
ing-stock! so that I hate myself and him."&#xD;
She Wvalked to the crib, and taking her boy in her arms, she&#xD;
passed swiftly into her bed-room.&#xD;
"Do not try to stop or follow me," (he had not moved,'but&#xD;
stood sorrowfully regarding her, his arms crossed.) "If you have&#xD;
not lost all respect for yourself and for me, leave me alone, go&#xD;
away as far as you can."&#xD;
She shut the door, and put her hand 'upon the key, but quickly&#xD;
removed it, and laid her baby down in his accustomed place, with&#xD;
her usual soft touch and quiet exactness, though 'twas a wonder&#xD;
where tenderness could hide under such a scornful face. The&#xD;
little fellow half opened his eyes, and threw up his arms, smiled,&#xD;
and murmured "Precious Papa," hard words for her just now,&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.             515&#xD;
when all her soul was alive with turbulent, jealous anger. She&#xD;
threw herself down, and buried her face in the pillow. Poor&#xD;
Cymbalius' vapid laugh still rung. in her ears, and the cackling&#xD;
pity from the women still stung her.&#xD;
In the dead hush which followed, she heard, George open his&#xD;
desk, draw up a chair, and knew that he sat down, and through the&#xD;
thin partition the noise of the scratching pen came distinctly to&#xD;
her ear.&#xD;
"Odious, selfish man!" she thought. " He can settle himself&#xD;
quietly to his calculations, while.my heart is breaking."&#xD;
An hour passed away, then she heard him get up, push back&#xD;
his chair ; then he walked quickly up and down, with heavy, un-&#xD;
certain steps; he stopped by her door, put his hand on the knob;&#xD;
she thought he was going to enter, and she- gathered up her anger&#xD;
to defy him, taunt him with her sufferings up at the hall; to let&#xD;
him know how fools and old women were mouthing his name.-&#xD;
le murmured a few words, and she heard him say Rutliie, she'&#xD;
thought it was dear Ruthie, and she caught the sound of a sob;&#xD;
but it did not soften her heart. The front door opened and shut,&#xD;
and all was still.&#xD;
The heavy night wore on ; the old clock told off the minutes,&#xD;
and every stroke fell a leaden blow upon her brain. She ceased&#xD;
to remember where George had gone, and why ; she could not&#xD;
think, the room became a whirling agony, in which she was spin-&#xD;
ning round and round, never to know rest and shelter more.&#xD;
When the sun arose, and the day grew broad, Pigeon awoke,&#xD;
and called "Papa," and screamed; she heard his voice, but as&#xD;
nothing concerning her, and he ,climbed around and laid his hands&#xD;
upon her, and tried to turn her face toward him. The touch of&#xD;
the soft baby arms aroused her, and she arose and tried.to unravel&#xD;
her perplexed thoughts, and pushed off the hair from her face,&#xD;
and sat up and looked about her. She was alone with her child,&#xD;
and she remembered why, and that she must be always alone,&#xD;
even with her husband by her side;. she who had used to have&#xD;
fond words and tender caresses for her daily food.&#xD;

Pigeon pointed to the door, and begged to go out ; she hesita-&#xD;
ted, forGeorge was there, and she did not know how she could&#xD;
ever speak to him  again ; but the child was so clamorous she&#xD;
forced herself to rise, and pulled the door slowly open, and looked&#xD;
fearfully out into the room where she had spoken such hard words&#xD;
only a few hours before.: The place was desolate ; the sunshine&#xD;
poured in upon the darkened ashes; ~ the fire had gone out on&#xD;
the hearth. She glanced angrily, resentfullyi at the open desk,&#xD;
and scattered papers, so unlike her husband's methodical nicety.&#xD;
" He was in such haste to go," she thought; " to go where ? why&#xD;
to his work, of course. I must have slept, and poor fellow, he&#xD;
had no breakfast !"&#xD;
This:natural, wifely thought only came like a flash, and van-&#xD;
ished. ' It was indeed real, then; they were sundered-he had&#xD;
left her without a word.. She steadied herself by the desk, and&#xD;
tried to think. how it would end.  Her eyes fell upon the ashes,&#xD;
and in the midst of her tumult she found time to be angry that&#xD;
he was so careless as to go to work without kindling a fire for her,&#xD;
and bringing fresh water, as he often did with a loving desire to&#xD;

A. couple of letters were lying on the velvet, close to some tiny&#xD;
wheels and cogs. The firm   characters arrested her wandering&#xD;
gaze; they were her husband's, and she spoke aloud her own&#xD;
name, reading it there.  She put ler child quickly away from&#xD;
her, and tore open the envelope, her blood boiling with fear, pride&#xD;
and anger..,&#xD;
"MYR DEAREST RUTHIE :                                '&#xD;
1Vy Darling Wife'--This is the last time I shall' ever call you-so, and you&#xD;
must bear with me, because'I am going out of your way, and shall trouble&#xD;
youno more. I have been slow to learn my lesson, a weary time ;. I can&#xD;
scarcely take it in now, but your letter has finished it. I did not know it&#xD;
was for that person till I had read it half through, and then I thought it&#xD;
right, to go on. I do not. wonder ' that you wrote the wrongname&#xD;
"pon i, foi- your little heart must have been tortured while, you penned it,&#xD;
and you could not keep me from your thoughts. It would be cowardly iii&#xD;
me to try any more. When I heard your talk up at Craigenfells; thait even-&#xD;
ing which seems so long ago, I twisted it out of my mind; I hated to know&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW    GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.                   517&#xD;
that my Ruthie had ever loved another man, and told him so ; she who was&#xD;
so my very own that I though I knew every crook and turn in her character,&#xD;
that she had kept hidden no secrets. - 'Twas bitter, but still not a crime-.&#xD;
only hard lines for me. Such things are happening every day-the husband&#xD;
comes in second best where he had thought to be first and all.&#xD;
I know, Ruthie, that I.am a great lumbering, clumsy fellow, and you are&#xD;
fine, and pretty, and graceful; and I am glad.that I was so wise to love you,&#xD;
after all, and I shall go on loving you till I die. Perhaps you will not care&#xD;
to have me tell you this, but it is so; you have a right to a better life than I,&#xD;
a poor blacksmith, can give you; you ought to have carriages, and horses,&#xD;
and servants, and if I had' not found out :that you did not love me, -but had,&#xD;
all the while you were lying in my bosom; been loving and regreting that&#xD;
person, (I cannot bring myself to name him,) I think 1 could have conquered&#xD;
fate, and forced her to yield me of her best ; I even pleased myself with 'the&#xD;
dream to see you mistress of a fine mansion, and all I found you so ardently&#xD;
and secretly desired.&#xD;
You have spoken in the letter about a divorce; I know you gre good and&#xD;
pure, and will do nothing wrong, and I am going away so that you can get&#xD;
one. I am going to desert you, so that you will have no difficulty-the fact&#xD;
will be patent to all. You will have to bear patiently my name a little&#xD;
while, and then you will be free. I know that I can trust it to you, and that&#xD;
you can give it back to me unspotted.&#xD;
You spoke some hard words about your picture, but I cannot give it up.&#xD;
I think I have a right to keep it ; right or .wrong, I shall. I do not blame&#xD;
you very much; I have seen you trying to fight your heart; it is hard work,&#xD;
isn't it, Ruth'? I have watched the struggle, and I understood-your sad faoe,&#xD;
and the tears you tried so often to hide. I cannot bear to see you fade away&#xD;
before my eyes, when an act of 'mine can give you love and life. My God !&#xD;
that I should have to say so to my wife ! - I can hold ,you despite the world ;&#xD;
I can force yon to live by my side; but what is it worth if I have no place&#xD;
in your sweet heart. Shall I be selfish'? Rest, poor child, suffer no more ;&#xD;
but oh, Ruth ! if you had only confided in me, how much better it would&#xD;
have been. I could have borne life better never to have had you, than now,&#xD;
when the richness and flavor is all gone.&#xD;
Poor Pigeon ! I hear his voice ; he calls me 'precious papa.' Pretty dar-&#xD;
ling, teach him to love me and remember me;. but no, you cannot do that,&#xD;
for you yourself will forget me. . When you are no longer my wife, when hu-&#xD;
man law has set you free, I shall claim my boy ; you can give him up then.&#xD;
But RIthie, do not'be frightened, I shall not come near you. I will send&#xD;
careful hands to fetch him.&#xD;
I must speak to you about money. You need feel no care. I have sold&#xD;
my rotary ; the price is invested for you. The house is yours, and enough&#xD;
in the savings to keep you from want. I shall not ask leave to love you,&#xD;

&#xD;
because Icannot take back what I gave, and the love for you is part of my&#xD;
being-it will never die.&#xD;
I shall do as you bade me; I am going as far away from you as I can, and-&#xD;
after whatis passed I don't think I wish ever to look in your face again.&#xD;
For the last time, my precious darling, my dear, dear wife, farewell. May&#xD;
God forever bless you."&#xD;
The first emotion which possessed Ruth's soul upon the com-&#xD;
pletion of the letter, was exulting joy. George was her George,&#xD;
after all I faithful and true. "Noble fellow!" she exclaimed, hot&#xD;
tears raining from her eyes; but before long astonishment came&#xD;
to the surface. Otho's name connected with hers ! she had never&#xD;
seen the faintest glimmer ofsuch a possibility.  She tried to go&#xD;
back to the Craigenfells evening in her memory, and she re-&#xD;
- called, with some effort, a conversation in which Otho had' wished&#xD;
that Chris should be permitted to drive- home with him in the&#xD;
curricle, and she had' interposed propriety scruples, and Mrs.&#xD;
Goldsmith's anger, but had finally yielded to his masterful deter-&#xD;
inination. Almost from  the arrival of Otho in Roaring River,&#xD;
her relations with her husband had been disturbed, and on a false&#xD;
footing. But Belle Brandon, not Otho, had been her stumbling-&#xD;
block.  She had gradually withdrawn from    his confidence, full&#xD;
of jealousy and unrest.&#xD;
She turned once moreto the sheet in her hand, and read slowly&#xD;
and'carefully.' "Your letter has finished it."  "What, letter ?"&#xD;
saidishe, aloud. "I have written nothing to him, .though I have&#xD;
often commenced, and could not bring myself to say my thoughts."&#xD;
Her eyes fell upon the other missive on the desk, and she took it&#xD;
into her bands, and tried to comprehend; her writing, and ad-&#xD;
dressed to her husband. She opened and commenced to read;&#xD;
till now she had been standing by the desk, but her limbs refused-&#xD;
longer to support her, and she sat down and 'tried to steady her&#xD;
thoughts, and force her trembling hands to hold firmly the per-&#xD;
fumed paper which fluttered in her grasp... She turned sick and&#xD;
faint, and glanced uneasily around her ; something reminded her&#xD;
of Belle Brandon; she was not sufficiently alive to her own sen-,&#xD;
sations to know that it was the faint odor of heliotrope which the&#xD;
&#xD;
blonde was so fond of using, wafted up- to her from the letter in&#xD;
her fingers, and she soon lost the unpleasant feeling that she had&#xD;
observed, in the concentration of her powers upon the strange&#xD;
epistle she was-reading. "I shall not get a divorce, you are mad&#xD;
to propose it."  She arose and staggered up and down the room&#xD;
to make sure she was awake, and 'then returned to the letter as&#xD;
if fascinated. She read it all through, and tossed it aside in dis-&#xD;
gust.&#xD;
"And George Blair, who has been my husband for two years,&#xD;
could believe me capable of that wretched stuff! nonsense! .he&#xD;
did not believe, it. It's a ruse, a mean ruse -to get rid of me.&#xD;
Let him go, I shall not condescend to implore him to stay, no.&#xD;
I'll break my heart first ! I'll go, he shall not find me here in&#xD;
his house 'when he returns to it."  Even through the surge of&#xD;
bitter thoughts, came a wave of memory ; through all her mad&#xD;
jealousy, her paraded coldness, her silence and 'sadness, her pet-&#xD;
ulance and scornful looks, she could recall nothing but gentlest&#xD;
kindness and great-hearted forbearance from her noble husband.&#xD;
Even while he was suffering under a belief of her treachery to&#xD;
him, for it was treachery, -,she could give it no better name;- and&#xD;
he had; her own writing a witness against her. That Belle Bran-&#xD;
don. had done her best to fascinate him she knew well, but had&#xD;
she succeeded ?  She was forced to own that she had no evidence&#xD;
in word. or action. All looked so differently, seen through this&#xD;
new 'medium. She ran to the door and threw it open. "Oh&#xD;
George, dearest George, come back to me, give me time to make&#xD;
it right i" She called twice, thrice, the lonely echo threw back&#xD;
her despairing voice. Baxter Williams was passing, with his wide-&#xD;
.mouthed dog at his heels, and he stopped and leaned over the&#xD;
gate, and listened, grinning at her.&#xD;
"Why don't you speak up,' Miss Blair, rather deaf ain't he ?"&#xD;
She shut the door hastily. "Of course he will not leave me.&#xD;
Why the sun shines, and the flowers bloom, the world looks just&#xD;
as usual, it cannot be that such a'horrible thing can happen to me.&#xD;
He is jealous, poor fellow. I know how that hurts. She smiled&#xD;

a pitiful smile. He must see as soon as he takes time to think'&#xD;
how impossible and absurd the whole thing is. Even if L could&#xD;
write it, I would' not serve myself of such a*paltry means of&#xD;
getting it to reach him. Why-! Iam his wife."&#xD;
She thought she would go up to the foundry (of course he must&#xD;
be there, he is such asteady, straightforward fellow,) and put&#xD;
her arms arounds his neck, and tell him  all about ,it, how very&#xD;
wickedly she had deceived herself, and beg him to believe her&#xD;
true and loving to him alone. Why the instant he looks at me&#xD;
lie will know.. Oh I wish. he would come," and she smiled at&#xD;
the face he would pull on when she should open his blind eyes to&#xD;
the real object of Otho's love, and she pursed up her lips to his&#xD;
favorite whistle. She ran up stairs to fetch her bonnet, and&#xD;
stopped at sight of her haggard face in the mirror. It would not do&#xD;
to disgrace him and drag their private troubles before all those&#xD;
rough men. No, she would wait at home, in her place, for his&#xD;
coming, and make him a nice breakfast ; he went out so early, he&#xD;
would be sure 'to return soon.. Batter cakes! No, waffles, George&#xD;
loved waffles, and though she had taken all care to give him what&#xD;
he liked, she thought with sinking heart, how few sweet words she&#xD;
had bestowed with the delicacies. The tempting meal' was all&#xD;
ready, still she was alone. Pigeon cried and tried =to pull her&#xD;
from the window. She took him up and gave him his breakfast,&#xD;
and sat do n again at her post. The morning-dragged away, it&#xD;
was high noon. She never ceased her watch, except to attend to&#xD;
her child, who, as the slow hours crept by, grew fretful,arid peev-&#xD;
ish, and when darkness closed around her, she remembered that&#xD;
she had given him no supper, and she sat down mechanically to&#xD;
make'him ready for his sleep.  Sing, mama, sing,"'said Pigeon,&#xD;
and he persisted with the peculiar tyranny of childhood, which&#xD;
ignores all feeling, 'tilishe commenced the lullaby, and she sang it&#xD;
all through, again' and 'again,iill' the weary little head drooped,&#xD;
and the long lashes'veiled the eyes, and she rose up to lay him in&#xD;
his'crib. As she did so, a noise on the piazza caught her ear.&#xD;
She dropped him hastily and flew to the door.. A great shaggy&#xD;
shepherds' dog rose friom the mat, shook himself, and walked in&#xD;
&#xD;
and came up and licked her hand. She had a massive'collar on&#xD;
her neck, bearing her name, "Flirt," and a card attached to it.&#xD;
"She is faithful and honest, as well as powerful, and will prove a sure pro-&#xD;
tecter to Ruth Blair, in spite of her name, as long as she needs her."&#xD;

CHAPTER THIRTY-FOURTH.&#xD;
DEBORAH' S BASKET.&#xD;
They were to start at ten o'clock, and it was half past nine&#xD;
already. The trunks were all packed, and standing on the walk,&#xD;
and Chris was leaning against the window, looking her farewell&#xD;
to all the familiar objects which had been silent witnesses of her&#xD;
trials, her-joys and sorrows, and straining her gaze down the grass&#xD;
bordered road, hoping to catch sight of a dear familiar little fig-&#xD;
ure : and her eyes filled with tears. " Maybe she will be at the&#xD;
cars," she thought, brightening up. " I am sure she will."&#xD;
Deborah had ridden down from Craigenfells in the little market&#xD;
wagon, to bid her " good bye," and take her in her old. arms with&#xD;
motherly fondness.&#xD;
"My child, my child," said she, " ten years to-day, I laid my&#xD;
little Bessie down beneath the daisies. I shut her blue eyes with&#xD;
my own hands, her pretty eyes, that used to dance and laugh at&#xD;
the sight of me. Yours area very like her's, Miss Chris, barrin&#xD;
the color. It amost breaks my heart 'to see you, but I must'nt&#xD;
cry, now that you're going away from us all. You'll come back a&#xD;
fine young lady with lots of learning, though I think you've plenty&#xD;
in your pretty head already."&#xD;
Deborah blew her nose, and said again that she was'nt going to-&#xD;
cry, and wiped her face on her vast handkerchief, and brightened&#xD;
up and opened a basket of marvelous dark lustrous brown, and&#xD;
curious weaving.-&#xD;
" I've brought you a few little notions for luncheon. Thomas&#xD;
was out on the hills at :sun-up this morning,' .and shot the birds,&#xD;
(522)&#xD;
&#xD;
and I cooked them nice, and I lined the basket myself and marked&#xD;
the napkins."&#xD;
She lifted the snowy covering, and- showed a couple of wood-&#xD;
cock, bedded in a crusty loaf. (" Thomas don't care a fig about&#xD;
the game laws.A He says God's birds on Craigenfells, are hizzen,")&#xD;
a form of jelly clear and bright, a tiny loaf of cake, some jolly&#xD;
red-checked summer Bon Cretans, half a dozen bunches of Mus-&#xD;
cadines, some peaches,,which proved the use of Thomas' forcing,&#xD;
besides nectarines and mesplis japonicas.&#xD;
"There dear, I don't believe any of the girls can show a better&#xD;
lunch than that, and you-need'nt be ashamed to open the basket&#xD;
nuther. I made it after one Miss Ellinor left up at the place last&#xD;
summer,.only I put satin where her's was leather, and I embroid-&#xD;
ered the rings and holdfasts, all myself, and these little goblets are&#xD;
fine cut and the salt-dish is solid silver; and look here, Miss Chris,&#xD;
dear," 5he took a morocco case from her pocket, and caressed it in&#xD;
her hard hands before she opened it. "These were her's, my Bes-&#xD;
sie's, she used to eat with them. Mr. Craigenfells fetched them from&#xD;
foreign parts." -It was- aknife, fork and spoon, '"With wooden han-&#xD;
dles of curious carving. See, they just fit the holdfasts. I knew&#xD;
what I was about, I believe, did'nt I, Miss Chris ?  I want you&#xD;
to have them for her sake; and I've got some finery for you too."&#xD;
She unrolled on her' hand a couple of yards of rare old English&#xD;
lace, yellow with age, and of elaborate pattern. "Miss Alice gave&#xD;
it to me when she was'a young lassie, and a sweet good child she&#xD;
was. You must keep it, and wear it when you want. to be"fine.&#xD;
It's grand enough for a countess, and you won't forget old Deb&#xD;
will you? If you would write to me just once, darling. I should&#xD;
like 'to have a real letter from my Pet, to keep in 'my box, and&#xD;
read sometimes, of a Sunday."&#xD;
" Indeed I will, dear 'Deborah, I will write to you every week,&#xD;
every Sunday night, and you shall- have all the news about;the&#xD;
girls, and I'll tell you what I study,' and all about the school, every&#xD;
thin'. I *kiow just what'll please you, don't I."  Chris threw&#xD;
her arms around the old creature's neck, whose heart was 'full of&#xD;
the mother-love she so yearned for, with a hearty burst of kisses,&#xD;

&#xD;
which made old Deb wipe her eyes, when she thought it over,&#xD;
and said. to herself the loving ,speeches, as 'she jogged back to&#xD;
Craigenfells.&#xD;
"Take care of your precious health, pretty, don't wet your feet&#xD;
and get your death a cold, because health is worth all the learn-&#xD;
ing in the world. I've got some nice yarn, I'm bleaching it in&#xD;
the window, I'm going to knit you some warm stockings against&#xD;
winter, and I'll smuggle in some goodies for you, pickles and&#xD;
cakes, when I send them. I hope they won't starve you out' up&#xD;
there. They say the cooking is'nt much at these grand schools.&#xD;
If they do, you tell me.  I1 put you up a box every evening, and&#xD;
Thomas, he'll be glad enough tossend it. He's going to be down&#xD;
at the station, and you must'nt miss- him. He'd do anything in&#xD;
the world for you, that his strength or cunning could."&#xD;
" Oh Deborah," said Chris,, clinging to her, "it is so good to&#xD;
have you come and talk so to me, and take such interest in me, I&#xD;
wish I could be Bessie to you and make you and Thomas glad,"&#xD;
and then she broke downand hid her face and her sobs in the&#xD;
motherly arms, opened to. receive her, and lay on the faithful&#xD;
breast, where Bessie's head had been cradled, and she felt a hand&#xD;
on her forehead, and heard a murmured payer, which she was-sure&#xD;
must be a blessing. The sharp hard words she had got that morning&#xD;
from her mother, melted out of her thoughts, and she forgot how&#xD;
she had pitched the things into the trunk, grumbling at the trouble,&#xD;
and jammed them down and laid a Bible on top.&#xD;
"There!" she"had ejaculated, "I don't put it in because I've&#xD;
any idee you will ever look into't. I know. you too well for that,&#xD;
but I've done my duty by you, and wash my hands of it."&#xD;
After Deb left, with many loving last looks, and gentle admo-&#xD;
nitions and soft mention of the dearChrist, who had carried our&#xD;
sorrows, -His love and pity, and sweetness in the touching utter-&#xD;
ance her often communion with Him gave her; and the grand&#xD;
beauty of His own. tender words to His disciples---Chris had a good&#xD;
cry, and was softened in spirit. She wished that she was good,&#xD;
and resolved to lead a true life, and felt glad that she had a chris-&#xD;

bid her adieu.&#xD;
"Miss Chris, could'nt you find' me 'a place to work for me&#xD;
board? I must be gettin the idication. Oh if I could only go&#xD;
along wid you. I can't bide much longer where I'm stoppin  I&#xD;
think that spalpeen of a boy'll be the death of me sooner or later,&#xD;
or I of him; he's a hard little beast, and his empty head is stuffed&#xD;
wid divlement entirely. I'm not going to complain and trouble&#xD;
me mother, and she wid' the baby to mind,-and the children to&#xD;
feed, but I must be gettin the larnin. I see the girls go by wid&#xD;
their books to school, and it just breaks the heart of me."&#xD;
" I thought Mrs. Williams was to send you to school, Sonsie."&#xD;
"Ah ! sorra a bit of schoolin I'll ever get out of t'auld dragon&#xD;
at all, at all. Indade, but she's the divil's own, Miss Chris, for&#xD;
ugliness. You'd never in the world believe me, if I told you the&#xD;
half of what she can do for meanness and contriariness."&#xD;
" Why don't you speak to Mrs. Blair, Sonsie-?"&#xD;
S" Sure I could'nt be vexing her now," said Sonsie, quickly, look-&#xD;
ing'down, " I'd rather fare on as I am, than do that."&#xD;
"When did you see her ?" Chris looked down the road wist-&#xD;
fully as she asked the question.&#xD;
/" I saw her just a minute this morning. -I came from there."&#xD;
"I thought she would come to kiss me good-bye," sighed Chris.&#xD;
" I could'nt get out. This is Saturday, I have not seenher since&#xD;
fair night, and that was Thursday."&#xD;
" She's-=-not-well," said Sonsie, hesitatingly. "I don't think&#xD;
she'll come out tis morning."  Then as it seemed, to turn the&#xD;
talk, she caught up Rainbow who was sitting close by the lunch&#xD;
basket, smelling at it occasionally, evidently not clear in his mind&#xD;
as to itscontents.&#xD;
"Poor fellow," said Chris, "I wish I had some home to leave&#xD;
him in, Sonsie. I hate to abandon him, with not a friend about&#xD;
the place. He'll miss me, I know. I might have told Pauline&#xD;
Bradshaw to coax him to stay over there, but even then I fear&#xD;
Bax Williams would ferret him out, he is bent on killing him,&#xD;
dear old Rainbow !"                  -&#xD;

"I know a place down on the flats where they are clean out&#xD;
of cats, where Bax would never think of looking for him."&#xD;
" But would they receive him joyfully, and feed him well ?"&#xD;
"Oh yes indeed, I'm sure of its They've a dog so fat that he&#xD;
can hardly Waddle."&#xD;
"That being the case, I'll consign him to your care," said Chris&#xD;
laughing, and kissing her favorite, fondly. "But you must keep&#xD;
an eyeon Bax, he is cunning as his father the d--eacon."&#xD;
"Tm eunning- too, Miss" Chris."  Sonsie closed one eye and&#xD;
fixed the other on Chris, explaining that that was the one she&#xD;
was-to keep upon Bax's movements. She had wonderful p wer&#xD;
over her facial muscles, and the open eye looked as clear and- dis-&#xD;
cerning as when aided by its fellow, now. extinguished under its&#xD;
smooth lid. " I'll be too many for the bla'gard. I'm thinkin its'&#xD;
you'll be married with Mr. Otho, some day."&#xD;
" Perhaps," replied Chris, blushing.&#xD;
"Will you take me to live wid ye then, and let me learn ?"&#xD;
"-Poor girl," said Chris, her heart full of sympathy with a de-&#xD;
sire she could so-well understand. "If ever I have a home, you&#xD;
shall have one too, and I will teach you all you want to know."&#xD;
" And you'll not forget me, when you come into your kingdom."&#xD;
Sonsie's eyes twinkled with sly brightness.&#xD;
"Not if you are faithful to Rainbow ; love me, love my cat,&#xD;
you kiiow."&#xD;
" You shall see that we are capab-able to take our own parts,&#xD;

OFF TO SCHOOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
THEsE. gregarious young Roaring Riverites always got up a&#xD;
party if any of them had a trip to make, so of course they were&#xD;
all to accompany the scholars to their destination: Belle and&#xD;
Mary Ann were the last arrivals at the station, and 'Jan Vedder&#xD;
and Cabby were in their train. Poor Jan followed every motion&#xD;
of Belle's with such looks of dumb devotion as a faithful dog&#xD;
gives his mistress, and accepted thankfully all crumbs of kindness&#xD;
she threw at him, and he shouldered Cabby out of the way, and&#xD;
trod on his toessevery opportunity. They had both been drink-&#xD;
ing, and Jan's face was flushed and his eyes blood-shot.&#xD;
Peter was there, carrying Zoe's smart French traveling bag,&#xD;
(provoking little Zoe, who played him fast and loose, and called&#xD;
him "ridiculous fellow," and laughed at him.)  The precious trio,&#xD;
Dick, Gracie, and Pauline, were there, of course, and the donkeys&#xD;
had all they could do to signal the coming and going trains with&#xD;
their long ears, and to wink ceaselessly on the bystanders. Pauline&#xD;
hung about Sabrina and Chris, and her eyes were red and swollen.&#xD;
She hated to part with her sister, and much more with her dear&#xD;
story-teller.&#xD;
Captain Slocum, who looked upon himself as one of the young&#xD;
people, drove up in his phaeton, drawn by the dangerous looking&#xD;
cow ponies, who tossed their restless heads and shaggy manes,sand&#xD;
twisted their necks to get a view of him and Dulcet, and looked&#xD;
as savage as if they had privately made up their minds to dash&#xD;
them in pieces presently and have an end. The captain carried&#xD;
things coolly, however, and evidently was master of the situation,&#xD;

He had-probably shown them the halter, and whispered .to then&#xD;
before starting ; and he handed Dulcet gallantly out, and took&#xD;
Chaid by the button for a few parting remarks.&#xD;
"I've bought the Clayton mansion, Goldsmith. I'm going to&#xD;
tear its insides out and fix it up smarter than a Jerusalem cricket.&#xD;
Rosewood, shittim wood, fine twined linen, and ram's skins dyed&#xD;
red, and badger skins."&#xD;
"Why captain, I had no idea you was such a Bible scholar."&#xD;
"Is that so ?. Well, I'll bet you a hat there ig'nt a man in&#xD;
Roaring River, the parson included, that 'reads his Bible as much&#xD;
as I do. It's a great book, a wonderful book, Chandy. You&#xD;
think because I state things strong, and clinch 'em with a damn&#xD;
once in' a while, that. I haven't got no religion. But Lord,&#xD;
Chandy l I'd give more for one ounce of 'do as you'd be done&#xD;
by,' than a- whole bushel of Deacon Williams' prayers. I did'nt&#xD;
mean to make fun of the Bible, neither ; but somehow the words&#xD;
kinder hung together in my mind, and- slipped out unbeknown.&#xD;
Dulcet looks fine, don't she? You ought to see her go round our&#xD;
new house ; spry, sir ! up stairs three steps to a time. And the&#xD;
nail holes'! Juniper ! how she did fire off the big words about&#xD;
'em!   I've got a house-keeper there, Chandy, that'll beat the&#xD;
field. I can have folks to dinner every day in the week, and&#xD;
good squarehot meals all the while. 'Did y'ever eat any of her&#xD;
mince pie?"&#xD;
" Splendid ! Captain, she's just the  wife for you."&#xD;
"So' I think, Chandy. I'm gladder every day she brought me&#xD;
up to the scratch, haw, haw! Sorry you can't stay to see us&#xD;
turned off; but we'll give you a smashing house-warming when&#xD;
you come home."&#xD;
The depot was full of fathers and mothers, hanging about their&#xD;
especial darlings with final' touches and tender partings. Mrs.&#xD;
Goldsmith was not there. She had taken leave of her boy with&#xD;
set lips and watery eyes, and poked a roll of bills into his hand&#xD;
as a' parting gift. She had suffered Chris to kiss her cheek, and&#xD;
in return for her pleading-" Good-bye, mother ; I'll try to be&#xD;
better when I get home again, and see if I can't be a comfort to&#xD;
you," the widow said-&#xD;
&#xD;
" Comfort ! humph'! If you ever get so as to pick up your&#xD;
duds after you it'll be more than I look forred to ;" and after a&#xD;
last look into the carriage where her handsome son was smilingly&#xD;
kissing his hand to her, and her beautiful daughter was weeping&#xD;
silently, with covered eyes, she slammed the door, and stalked to&#xD;
her room to read the Great Tribulation, and her favorite chapter&#xD;
in Revelations, about death on the pale horse, and the vials of&#xD;
wrath.&#xD;

CHAPTER THIRTY-SIXTH.&#xD;
CHRIS ON TOMMY TIDDLER'S GROUND.&#xD;
EVERYTHING Chris had on was new, and she looked neat and&#xD;
pretty. Her dress of black and white shepherd's plaid, fitted to&#xD;
a charm; and her little straw hat, with plaid ribbons and a clus-&#xD;
ter of ripe blackberries, was very becoming. To be sure, in her&#xD;
absent fit, while mourning over Ruth's non-appearance, she had&#xD;
buttoned her dress awry; but Zoe flew at her the instant she saw&#xD;
her, and set that right, and scolded and kissed her. She and Sa-&#xD;
brina were falling into a habit of looking Chris over and touching&#xD;
her up, in the matter of buttons and pins, which always made&#xD;
Otho angry when he saw it, and was a theme for biting jests&#xD;
from Chandy, till one day Belle joined him, and then he treated&#xD;
the blonde .to a;scathing quotation from Bill Shakes, and kept&#xD;
silence afterwards. Poor Chris was very thankful to the girls,&#xD;
and loved them dearly. She had' pretty well made up her mind&#xD;
that she did not possess the ability to put on her clothes properly,'&#xD;
and she grieved spasmodically over the fact when it was thrust&#xD;
upon her observation, so that she could not shirk it. As' to her&#xD;
mind-rank, she had take that by acclimation. They acknowl-&#xD;
edged her superiority, and rejoiced in her. They brought her&#xD;
knotty questions ; and anything they wanted out of old authors,&#xD;
and were too lazy to hunt or could not come at, found ready an-&#xD;
swers from her ; her word was final and decisive ; nobody thought&#xD;
of going back of it. Even Belle Brandon, who turned up her&#xD;
waxy little nose at her rumples, said, "How nice it was to have&#xD;
a person at one's elbow who had swallowed the dictionary," and&#xD;
-(530)&#xD;
&#xD;
secretly made up her mind to trot her for a pony up at Rosen-&#xD;
bloom.&#xD;
The train came sweeping around the curve just as Cabby was&#xD;
about propounding a new "widdle," and everybody rushed madly&#xD;
at the platform, as if their salvation depended upon being first in.&#xD;
Chris had never been in a car in her life ; she had often stopped&#xD;
to watch the approaching monster, whose snorts and doings&#xD;
seemed like the awful giant in the fairy tale, who drank up -all&#xD;
the rivers and swallowed the bullocks whole, and breathed forth&#xD;
fire and smoke from his nostrils. When she was put safely into&#xD;
her place by the window,,.at Otho's side, and, after a few premon.&#xD;
itory snorts and a couple of fierce yells from their giant, he be&#xD;
gan to drag them slowly forward, she held her breath with fear,&#xD;
astonishment, and delight, such an odd commingling of emotions&#xD;
that she, could not have told which most possessed her soul.. She&#xD;
gave absorbed'attention to the: gliding pictures-the: trees, and&#xD;
fields, and water brooks, which sailed past in magical progression.&#xD;
N6t one of her thoughts went astray among the jokes and tricks&#xD;
of the young party, in which Chandos and Belle took conspicuous&#xD;
share. The absolute certainty that she was really off, on her way&#xD;
to school, was hard to take into her consciousness. She had been&#xD;
so sore afraid, up to the last moment,'that something might break&#xD;
up her hopes. Her mother's- parting, which choked her while she&#xD;
witnessed the tender leave-takings in the depot, faded out of her&#xD;
thoughts, and she clasped her hands onher lap and gazed her fill;&#xD;
her delight was unmixed, absolute.&#xD;
As light reading on the journey,-she had provided herself with&#xD;
Homer's fliad and Pollock's "Course of Time," both gilt edged&#xD;
morocco bound college prizes of 'her father's. As yet 'she had&#xD;
found no use for the volumes, and Otho, after looking. at them&#xD;
with a quiet laugh, put them safely away in his pocket.&#xD;
Just behind bertha and Chandos, who sat together, there was&#xD;
a family-father, mother,, and five children, all huddled into the&#xD;
two seats, (turned face to face,) and on the floor a huge dog, which&#xD;
the mother covered with her skirts every time the conductor came&#xD;
by, evidently supposing she was saving a fare bf her artful strat-&#xD;

egy. The oldest girl was but a little thing, and the youngest a&#xD;
baby. They were coming home from the silver mines of Nevada,&#xD;
which the father had been working. The inexhaustible "Silver&#xD;
lode "-lured by the falsehoods and trickery of the reckless com-&#xD;
pany, he had sunk in it all his savings, as well as his- time and&#xD;
health. The rock did not pay for milling-no silver in it. The&#xD;
company had "bubbled," and this poor fellow cast aside with the&#xD;
other workers and worthless trash, and he had been weary weeks&#xD;
working his way back to civilization to begin anew. The mother&#xD;
looked worn out and discouraged. The ill-smelling, ill-dressed,&#xD;
dirty children, were peevish, fretful, and quarrelsome. The boys&#xD;
sat, down on the dog and made him howl, and pitched into each&#xD;
other remorselessly, and'she made no effort to comfort them, un-&#xD;
less a sharp "hold your noise !" punctuated with a ringing slap,&#xD;
was comfort. The thin, weary, restless girl tossed and tumbled&#xD;
about, scattering her bread in all directions, and .anointing her&#xD;
neighbors with the butter. The hollow-eyed baby moaned and&#xD;
twisted about in its mother's arms, in a vain endeavor to&#xD;
wri gle out of its filthy woolen sacque and hood, which last would&#xD;
persist in bandaging one of its eyes, while its lanky unkempt&#xD;
locks effectually extinguished the other. The maternal counten-&#xD;
ance was all knotted up with fretful impatience and hard cross-&#xD;
ness. The father sat and slept, with his. head back in a break-&#xD;
neck attitude, and his mouth wide open and defiled with tobacco&#xD;
juice. When the children crowded and bumped him, he opened&#xD;
his eyes and snarled and hit out at them with his fists, and then&#xD;
his head went. back again and he was as fast as ever, with the&#xD;
ugly pucker still contracting his unwashed, unshaven countenance.&#xD;
The baby, in its :gyrations, became possessed of the knob of Chan-&#xD;
dy's cane (held over his shoulder,) and commenced sucking it&#xD;
with vast i-elish. Chandy glanced at it, looked unutterable dis-&#xD;
gust, and twitched it away witha jerk which hurt the poor thing&#xD;
and made it cry. The mother looked to see the cause of this&#xD;
new trouble, and discovered Chandy wiping the desecrated knob,&#xD;
and noted his wrathful aspect, and he such a' fine gentleman!&#xD;
She shook the bundle of bones, and gave it a rattling slap, as the&#xD;
best amends in her power, glancing at him for approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S.DAUGHTER.533&#xD;
&#xD;
Bertha looked annoyed, disturbed, and venturep upon a whis-&#xD;
pered expostulation with my lord.&#xD;
'- Oh Chandos, how could you?  The poor dear would not have&#xD;
hurt your stupid cane. It looks so sick and 'tired, and now you&#xD;
have gotten-it a beating," and she fixed her reproachful eyes full&#xD;
upon Chandy's face.&#xD;
"I'm not going to have my cane slobbered over by that dirty-&#xD;
mouthed animal. I have a habit of putting it to my own lips, oc-&#xD;
casionally; I hope I shall never so far forget myself as to do-it&#xD;
again. I don't see what business such cattle have in here any-&#xD;
how ; they hre coming between the wind and my nobility. There's&#xD;
a second-class on the train.  Such filth-paugh! they offend&#xD;
every one of my senses, and would if I had five hundred, which,&#xD;
thank heaven! I have not."&#xD;
Bertha regarded him a moment in indignant silence ; then she&#xD;
got up and went back and said:&#xD;
"Let me take your baby a little while, she is -tired of the cars.&#xD;
Hard for little people, isn't it ?"&#xD;
The words were nothing, but she smiled into their faces, and&#xD;
half the crossness and trouble melted away from the mother di-&#xD;
rectly.&#xD;
" She's so dirty, Miss, I hate to have the likes of you touch&#xD;
her; but indeed I cannot help it. We've been five weeks coming&#xD;
over the plains, and we are fit to die,.all of us."&#xD;
"Come here, little one."  Bertha held out her hands, and the&#xD;
dirty baby accepted, gazing all the while fearfully into the pretty&#xD;
eyes which looked the invitation, and the young lady sat doivn&#xD;
again by Chandy; but she turned as far away as she could from&#xD;
him. Then she pulled off the extinguishing cap, and the filthy&#xD;
sacque, and taking a clean handkerchief from her bag, she'bade&#xD;
the boy go wet it at the water-jar. He obeyed with delighted&#xD;
alacrity, and she bathed the hot face and hands, and sprinkled them&#xD;
plentifully'with Jean Maria Farina, and straightened its dress, and&#xD;
smoothed it out generally; and opening the lunch-basket, she"got&#xD;
out an Edinburg biscuit foray it to bite; and really the little&#xD;
creature looked quite human, not to say pretty.&#xD;

nI guess children take to you kinder natural you are mighty&#xD;
handy with them, anyways," said the, gratified mother; and seeing&#xD;
show much could be effected with a little water, she changed her&#xD;
opinion of=the case, which she had been in the habit of consider-&#xD;
ing hopeless;, and: pounced upon the rest of the tribe, and rubbed&#xD;
them down, and- shook them up, tied their shoes, buttoned their&#xD;
garments; and the 'pater familias roused himself, and contempla-&#xD;
ted Bertha with approbation, and taking his second on his lap, he&#xD;
drewout a wooden pocket comb, and put it through and through-&#xD;
hisscrubby, sun-burnt crop, regardless of wry faces; and having&#xD;
wiped his nose in the same remorseless fashion, he considered&#xD;
'him finished off, and bumped his head down against his waist-&#xD;
coat, and the weary eyes soon closed in slumber.&#xD;
Bertha's charge - reached out her claws of hands and touched&#xD;
the shining cross her new ,friend wore, and her steel buttons, all&#xD;
the while looking in her eyes. Seeing only smiles, she drew her&#xD;
chain towards ;her, and put it to her mouth. Bertha took outthe&#xD;
watch, and both little claws fastened upon it 'directly&#xD;
Chandy saw all :this- out of the tail of his eye, and it did not&#xD;
please him. 'He had a young manish aversion to babies, and he&#xD;
disliked to see that sour, unwholesome thing in Bertha's arms, and&#xD;
he could;not understand how:she could bear to touch it, so deli-&#xD;
cate and lady-like as she was in all her ways.- As he could&#xD;
scarcely take in the monstrous idea that anything he saw fit to'do&#xD;
should be disagreeable to Bertha, (conceited young jackanapes!&#xD;
-but what wonder, so flattered and made of, as he was,) he tried&#xD;
tid call her attention'to. the swiftly-moving panorama speeding:past&#xD;
them; bit she answered coldly, and cor centrated her energies&#xD;
upon the bag of bones, and 'astonished the .young gentleman by&#xD;
humming little ,crodning song in its ears, which soon set it off&#xD;
to sleep, and she -had the satisfaction of handing it back to its&#xD;
mother, fast and happy.&#xD;
" Two out of five disposed of; there's three more, Bertha,"&#xD;
said Chandy,"and:the dog has his nose pointed at you; better&#xD;
go throughthe whole ,lot ; pity to pause in the middle of a good&#xD;
work."&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITh'S .DAUGHTER.      -      35&#xD;
But she pretended not to hear, and pulled down her veil, and&#xD;
leaned her head in her hand, and thought-&#xD;
" Can it be? Chandy unkind and hard of heart ! not perfect,&#xD;
after all."&#xD;
He had pulled his cap over his eyes, after his last essay, and&#xD;
appeared to sleep, and his fine-featured face looked remarkably&#xD;
handsome, and Bertha thought-&#xD;
"I had no idea his eye-lashes were so very long, and curled,&#xD;
too," as she stole a look in adjusting her veil.&#xD;
He waked up all at once, and pushed back his cap to its proper&#xD;
place over his brown curls, when an orange boy came past, shout-&#xD;
ing his wares.&#xD;
"Here, youngster," said he; leaning coolly across Bertha's lap,&#xD;
'we'll invest in a few of those."&#xD;
He threw a cap-full among the children behind him, who&#xD;
opened their hands joyfully ; and selected a dozen or so, which&#xD;
he offered, with a queer face,-to the silent young. lady.&#xD;
."A sop for Cerberus,.Bertha," said.he, and laughed. He knew&#xD;
well his power, and had been only biding his time. "That's a&#xD;
lucky young Fejee you've been coddling; I hope she appreciates&#xD;
her privileges. Those little specimens are the ones for getting&#xD;
into all the good places; mighty nice thing to be a baby. Now&#xD;
don't annihilate a fellow with your moral glances."&#xD;
"I must say that I am disappointed, Chandos; I thought you&#xD;
were always kind and good.".&#xD;
"Disappointed in me ! pelle Brandon says I am her ideal.; she&#xD;
assured me that I am often before her when she is perusing some&#xD;
of her favorite volumes; I remind her of Charles Torp, Mr. Lin-&#xD;
den, and Corneille DeWitt: There's variety for you."&#xD;
"Yes, I heard her tell, you so, and I saw her face, also."&#xD;
"So did I, Miss Bertha, and I owe her one; let her drop. Do&#xD;
you think now, that I am not good'?"&#xD;
"IT am afraid you are hiard-hearted, Chandos."&#xD;
"Nonsense, Bertha! I'm good enough, but it don't follow that&#xD;
I must get up a fuss over every dirty baby I see. I like )abies&#xD;

&#xD;
on a general estimate, a- good ways off, especially bad-smelling&#xD;
ones. You see they are not in my line."&#xD;
" I think kindness and sympathy should to be in everybody's&#xD;
line; and you said it ought to have its neck wrung," replied Ber-&#xD;
tha, very gravely..&#xD;
"Are you not making an unnecessary coil about a very infini-&#xD;
tesinal peccadillo ?" said Chandy, rather enjoying the lecture he&#xD;
was getting, as one enjoys a new piquant sauce with a favorite&#xD;
dish.&#xD;
"I don't know how-you can-say so; I think it -is no triflle to&#xD;
give needless pain, and I pity little children more than any other&#xD;
young ,animals; poor, helpless wretches ! subject to the caprices&#xD;
and humor of the old, strong ones-no redress, no appeal. It is&#xD;
the saddest sight I know to see a poor baby's lip curl in piteous&#xD;
grief, and to get it a blow! dreadful! I couldn't forgive my-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
" Don't say any more; I feel sufficiently quenched. The next&#xD;
baby I see I'll fly and present my cane at once, and I'll make a&#xD;
present of the thing afterwards to the nearest male relative pres-&#xD;
ent."&#xD;
The cars stopped at " Moose-Missie" station, and the mining&#xD;
party bundled out, and Bertha blushed very much, and Chandy&#xD;
laughed more, when the pater familias said:&#xD;
"You're a nice good. little girl; I thank you for your kindness&#xD;
to my young ones; you deserve to have a fine baby of your own,&#xD;
one of these days, and I should like to be there to see the chris-&#xD;
tening"'&#xD;
"A Daniel come to judgment!" said- Chandy, ,clapping his&#xD;
hands; and he got up and made-a great show of helping the chil-&#xD;
dren off, touching them, however, rather gingerly, and kicking&#xD;
the dog softly, who acknowledged the attention with a decided&#xD;
growl.,&#xD;
The girls had sections of the sleeping-car to themselves, but so&#xD;
new and, strange was the whole to Chris, that she scarcely shut&#xD;
her eyes, but lay within the closed curtains, dreaming all sorts of,&#xD;
odd dreams, and setting the continuous "rac-a-tac " of the wheels&#xD;
&#xD;
to music, which went on repeating itself over and over again.&#xD;
She was up first in the dusky morning, poking here and flhere, in&#xD;
search of her belongings, and counting over the articles she had&#xD;
in charge.&#xD;
".My bag, one ; lunch-basket, two ; veil, three; parasol, fotir ;&#xD;
Pollock and Homer, five ;" but Pollock and .Homer refused to&#xD;
come to time, being safely hidden away in Otho's pocket ; and&#xD;
Chris got down on the floor in the dim lamp-light, whigh'was&#xD;
sleepily fighting with the day-dawn, to hunt for her venerable&#xD;
friends. She espied something shining, and reached out towards&#xD;
it.&#xD;
" Oh, girls ! I'm on Tommy Tiddler's ground ! ' I've found !&#xD;
-oh good gracious! 'tis a set of teeth !" and she dropped them&#xD;
from her fingers in a hurry.&#xD;
"They belong to that old woman in the next section," whis-&#xD;
pered Zoe ; "she was prancing up and down the passage all&#xD;
night, in a calico wrapper; I saw it whisk by ever so many times&#xD;
-Turkey red. There's a bit of it sticking out now."&#xD;
~ Chris peered cautiously up ; "I wonder if I had better poke&#xD;
them under her curtain, or waken her and give them into her&#xD;
hand."&#xD;
" Wake her up, of course, I want to hear what she will say."&#xD;
In accordance with this advice, Chris took the teeth gingerly&#xD;
between her thumb and finger, and twitched the curtains gently.&#xD;
"Madam! madam! Please wake up; I think I have found&#xD;
something of yours ; I am afraid they will get lost."&#xD;
A burly, grey head elevated itself; a large hand plucked at the&#xD;
curtain, and deep, bewildered eyes stared down at her.&#xD;
" Oh horrors ! it's a man !" shrieked Zoe, who was watching&#xD;
proceedings ; and she and Chris retired hastily, and closed their&#xD;
curtains.&#xD;
" Eh ! what is it ?" inquired a deep voice ; a sound of smack-&#xD;
ing lips followed. " What's gone with my grinders ? charitable&#xD;
grinders, ha! ha!" sA general stirring up of pillows and bedding&#xD;
followed.&#xD;

"J-Iere tley are, sir," said Chris, coming out from her retreat;&#xD;
"I found them on the floor."&#xD;
" Bless me, what an escape! a mercy there werenone of those&#xD;
feet abroad which must step somewhere. Hand them up, young&#xD;
friend, excellent, sweet.voiced friend;, and if you should happen&#xD;
to be in want of a grandfather, you may 'command my services&#xD;
in that capacity to an unlimited extent; to say. that I am grateful&#xD;
faintly expresses my feelings."-&#xD;
".Why, Uncle Alec,! where did you come from ?" ,exclaimed&#xD;
Chris,,in a glad flutter; and without stopping to think, she seized&#xD;
the white hand extended to her, and kissed it, and then dived&#xD;
shame-faced under her curtain.&#xD;
"What the devil!" said the voice. "Those might be Zitella's&#xD;
lips, but she calls me Senor Alika; this child said Uncle Alec."&#xD;
The hand parted the- curtains again, and the barrly head ap-&#xD;
peared.&#xD;
" Who calls so loud ?"&#xD;
"Uncle Alec," questioned Sabrina.&#xD;
" Uncle Alec," repeated Zoe.&#xD;
" Uncle Alec," chorused Chandy and Otho, from the next see-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"It appears that I am in the midst of .many nephews and neices.&#xD;
Givene time to appear in proprie habilantis, and I will come&#xD;
forth and review my family."--&#xD;
When the berths were put up,.and order restored, Uncle, Alec&#xD;
put.on his double" eye-glass, and looked out for his kindred. . He&#xD;
was a stout, broad-shouldered old fellow, with grizzled, sandy&#xD;
hair, and, long, flowing silky beard, and a. famous corporation,&#xD;
which suggested no end of good dinners. His bright eyes shone&#xD;
through his glasses with penetrative, sharp intelligence, and his&#xD;
fresh, perfectly unwrinkled face was ruddy and pleasant.&#xD;
Hie expressed, great pleasure at' this unexpected meeting, and&#xD;
kissed all.the girls, Belle Brandon included, who gave herself up&#xD;
to the pastime with joyous abandon ; and she 'maneuvered suc-&#xD;
cessfully for a good place in the circle which closed around him,&#xD;
where his eyes could not help 'resting upon her, and observing&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDS3XITII'S DAUGHTER.            539&#xD;
how very appreciatingly she listened to his tropical tales and de-&#xD;
scriptions; and Chris got treated to a Geraldine glance when&#xD;
Uncle Alec drew her forward and held her hand, and squeezed&#xD;
her close up to him, while he talked in a.deep, resounding voice&#xD;
above all the ",rao-a-tac " of ,car-wheels, and snorting of the en-&#xD;
gine.&#xD;
These young folks all adored Uncle Alec; he was almost a&#xD;
Providence .to them. Such parties and balls as he gave, when he&#xD;
was at home ! Craigenfells was open at all times, and Thomas&#xD;
instructed to provide unlimited entertainment when they choseto&#xD;
go there. Nobody wasafraid .of him, not even Chris,,who had&#xD;
not been permitted to keep. iup her intimacy with him since her&#xD;
papa's'death, and she, could scarcely force back her tears while&#xD;
she looked and listened. But by one of those queer revulsions&#xD;
of feeling. which we all experience, she burst out in uncontrolable&#xD;
laughter.when Mary Ann Williams held up her hands and ex-&#xD;
claimed:&#xD;
" Only think, girls! the woods all full of peacocks, and parrots,&#xD;
and monkeys, all hanging about on the, trees and things by their&#xD;
reprehensible tails!"&#xD;
"A famous place for Robinson Cruso-ing, Mary Ann, is it not ?"&#xD;
said Bertha, whose kind heart ached, for the poor girl, who though&#xD;
so inoffensive, was continually contriving; to be ridiculous. "Defos.&#xD;
would be quite in raptures there."&#xD;
" It is quite doubtful ;whether, Defoe ever put pen to that Par-&#xD;
adise of our childhood, Bertha," said Chris, plunging into the&#xD;
.topic to cover, her offensive mirth, which she was heartily sorry&#xD;
for. "Lord Byron more than hints that the first volume at any-&#xD;
rate, was written by the first Lord Oxford, when in the Tower,&#xD;
and given by him to Defoe,"&#xD;
"Oh quit that, Chris," exclaimed Chandos, twisting himself&#xD;
impatiently about. Don't.unsettle things , which are nicely dis-&#xD;
posed of. I hate that sort of thing. Bishop Colenso has been&#xD;
at .it, trying to number the Israelites, account for the miracles, and&#xD;
unfasten all the old landmarks. I think it is very unpleasant&#xD;

"So do I, Chandos. 1 believe the Bible just' as it is, every&#xD;
quaint line in it, every bit of obselete old English suits me."&#xD;
" Quite right, Pet. Orthodox little Pet, (another small squeeze.)&#xD;
Stick to the faith of your fathers. It is of little consequence to&#xD;

coming out of Egypt. They got out and possessed the promised&#xD;
land, that's the nub of the story. Job may-have been a .man or&#xD;

Shakes was no great'shakes after all, but written by about a dozen.&#xD;
As if anybody but Billy, the Stroller, could have done it ! It&#xD;

Uncle Alec left the discussion and bent over Chris. " It was&#xD;
you Pet. This was the way you did it." ,(He kissed her hand.)&#xD;
"I was in a muddle for a minute. You see there is but one&#xD;
female who makes a regular business of kissing my hand. She&#xD;
is a poor little Mexican, a tawny Lepero, and my first thought&#xD;
was of her, but I know it was you," he rapped his teeth with his&#xD;
long finger-nail.&#xD;
" Yes sir," said she merrily. "I was the early bird."&#xD;
" I've got something for you. I brought it on purpose for the&#xD;
first pretty girl who did a thing to please me, and I am glad it&#xD;
was my dear Pet: though you've been so shy of me since you've&#xD;
left off short frocks; I hav'nt forgot the old times. Come back&#xD;
to my seat, and let me open my bag."&#xD;
She went with him to the next car, and watched him curiously&#xD;
while be got out a little box, and displayed a golden comb with&#xD;
narrow braided top and rich filagree tassels at.its corners. "Mex-&#xD;
ican gold, Pet, pretty toy' is'nt it ? Tou must wear it once in a&#xD;
while when you want to think, about Uncle Alec. I'll always&#xD;
come when you put it on."&#xD;
" Thank you, dear Uncle, I shall wear it often if you will prom-&#xD;
ise' me that; though finery is'nt much in my line, I shall like this&#xD;
very much."&#xD;
"What have you got there," questioned Belle, when Chris&#xD;
&#xD;
came back with the box in her hand'; of course you will give four&#xD;
friends the benefit of a peep."&#xD;
"'The fardel there ! what's i' the fardel ? wherefore that box ?'&#xD;
Miss 'Mopsa Pandora would know," said Chandy.&#xD;
Chris surrendered it rather unwillingly. She hated to have&#xD;
Belle touch anything she liked.&#xD;
"Oh what a beauty," exclaimed Belle, making a face at Chan-&#xD;
dos. " You must let me arrange for you a Sappho knot, the first&#xD;
school party : this would be a lovely finish, would it not .Mr.&#xD;
Groenveldt ?  Pray, may I inquire how you have earned it, or&#xD;
was it pure benevolence."&#xD;
"1She earned it by being the early bird," said Uncle Alec.&#xD;
"Girls, don't let us give sleep to our eyes, nor slumber to our&#xD;
eyelids hereafter." Uncle Alec laughed, and studied the beauti-&#xD;
ful dimples offered to his gaze with benevolent pleasures.&#xD;
"And so you are all going to school ?" He included the whole&#xD;
party in his friendly glance.&#xD;
""Oh no sir ! Those young gentlemen are not scholars. Mr.&#xD;
Bradshaw, Mr. Brown, Mr. Vedder. I don't believe you' have&#xD;
been presented."&#xD;
"1Mr. Brown, happy to:meet you sir, in such good company.&#xD;
If you want a young fellow to teach you farming, here's my&#xD;
nephew Peter can take you through. This Jan is an old friend&#xD;
of mine ; he used to help me snare woodchucks when he was'nt&#xD;
knee high, but I expect you could teach them all something worth&#xD;
learning, my dear, even if they are not regular pupils."&#xD;
Uncle Alec took her rosy soft chin in his hand, and made funny&#xD;
round eyes at her. It was curious, how all the masculines who&#xD;
came near Belle wished to try their fingers on her fresh creamy&#xD;
flesh, and she knew precisely what to do, and how to look in such&#xD;
cases: when- to withdraw in lofty scorn, or as at present, to sub-&#xD;
mit, unresistingly, and she replied with bewitching sparkle, half&#xD;
veiled under tender modesty.&#xD;
" I don't know, sir, as I could, I've to study very hard myself&#xD;
at all events, for this is my last year in school."&#xD;
Poor Peter was following Zoe's motions with troubled glances.&#xD;

She hard been more Than usually tantali ing and tormenting all the&#xD;
journey, and had talked with SamSlaighton, and made fun with&#xD;
everybody, when he wanted her all to himself,.and he felt this&#xD;
especially hard as she knew that he had made sacrifice of a county&#xD;
horse fair and horticultural show, to .acconp any her.&#xD;
" I am learning a hard lesson, Zoe,"-whispered he, "my mis.&#xD;
tress is pretty but wicked."&#xD;
" Oh hush, Peter. I'm disgusted."&#xD;
"Disgusted with me," said Peter,. who was just in the mood&#xD;
for picking.up trifles.&#xD;
" Of course I am, how can I help it. You're such a ridiculous&#xD;
fellow-"&#xD;
"Am I ?" Peter straightened himself and crossed his arms.&#xD;
"I think I am best off in the great fields, living my farm life.&#xD;
I'm not ridiculous there at all events," and he took an " Agricul-&#xD;
turist" from his pocket and read.&#xD;
Zoe admired him when he looked thus, and she thought, "why&#xD;
don't he always speak and 'act with such manly dignity. He's&#xD;
to good by half, he has no business to let me spin him around my&#xD;
finger as he does," and the young gipsey set herself to undo her&#xD;
work, and make him put up his book and smile on her, and before&#xD;
he knew it, he was buttered all over.&#xD;
" Black Crook Station !" sung out the conductor, " twenty min-&#xD;
utes for refreshments." Anid Uncle Alec tucked Chris underhis&#xD;
arm and marched off to the table, and while he helped her and&#xD;
himself to the most tempting viands within reach, he slily watched,&#xD;
the pairing off of the young people, with whimsical enjoyment.&#xD;
He touched Otho's sleeve (who had followed close at his heels, and&#xD;
.stood on his other side by the long counter.)&#xD;
" Look," said he, "all paired off, two and two, ready to enter&#xD;
the ark. All but my little Pet here ; she's got no double."&#xD;
Chris threw a shy fond look at Otho, which told her story so&#xD;
well that it needed no words, and Uncle Alec laughed and patted&#xD;
her shoulder.&#xD;
"Well done, pretty child. You've takenup with a fine, proud'&#xD;
fellow for your lover. As good as gold, but you must not let him&#xD;
&#xD;
be your tyrant; he has got an iron will of his own, under that&#xD;
grave quiet. You must look out for him, or all your sweet indi-&#xD;
vidualities will be merged and lost in his."&#xD;
While Chris was thinking over this speech, with a face which&#xD;
looked as if the merging would be difficult, Sam Slaughton claimed&#xD;
her attention with a plate' of, cucumbers.&#xD;
"I've found. out where your heart was,.Otho, my boy, though&#xD;
you pride yourself upon command of your face, but you see old&#xD;
fellows like me know things intuitively. You've . chosen a rare&#xD;
pearl. I congratulate you,.I could'nt have done it bettermyself,&#xD;
iore to my mind, but I almost wonder at your wisdom too, with&#xD;
that brilliant sparkling at your elbow. What a lovely creature&#xD;
it is ; beautiful'as a hourii, not that I suppose they are anything&#xD;
remarkable. If they are all like the mortal inhabitants of the&#xD;
Sultan's Harem, they are fat and stupid pieces of tame, inanity,&#xD;
without ideas ; whose life is a weary burden to them. Of course&#xD;
we don't need to be told that there are no such beauties as we have&#xD;
at home. We bring up o    'ur young women to think and act for&#xD;
themselves, consequently they. are to be trusted, and are equal to&#xD;
life's tasks. Just look at this party, what absolute contrasts,, and&#xD;
what ._perfect girlhood purity and strength. Why, Mahomed&#xD;
would have gone frisky mad, if he had been in my place a. while&#xD;
ago, and would not-have fared as well either ; our girls would'nt&#xD;
abide Turkish lumpiness. Poor miserable benighted old heathen.&#xD;
He should have seen American girls before he pronounced upon&#xD;
beauty. Have some coffee, Pet?  Don't think I willfully turned&#xD;
my back on you, but Otho here talks, so fast I can't get a word&#xD;
in edgewise." -&#xD;
Chris smiled, she was still thinking of the individualities. "No,&#xD;
thank you, Uncle. My mother taught me to drink only water&#xD;
from :the spring."&#xD;
"Quite right. Pet, very wise of your mother,. and, I am glad to&#xD;
see that you;don't gobble either: Why, that girl opposite (point-&#xD;
ing to Mary Ann Williams) has: had baked beans, custard pie,&#xD;
roast pig, seed-cakand pickles, and two cups of this horrible cof-&#xD;
fee, besides the doughnuts and apples, which she has stuffed into&#xD;

her pocket, and we haven't been in the place twenty minutes yet.&#xD;
No wonder her face is sallow aid her eyes heavy. .ied Gold-&#xD;
smith was-a dainty feeder. Remember your Papa, Pet?   I've&#xD;
never replaced him on my list of friends. You are very like&#xD;
him."&#xD;
Turning away , from the emotions his talk had called up'&#xD;
Uncle Alec whispered to Otho, " How did it come about ?"&#xD;
"I have been spending Bertha's vacationtime as you requested&#xD;
sir;settling the Library at Craigenfells."&#xD;
"Ah yes, I see, and you found my little Pet reading up there,&#xD;
in a silken gown.. I can fancy her bent head and clustering&#xD;
curls, (she's got magnificent hair, Otho; her father was always&#xD;
showing it off to me,) a dainty-little slipper, resting on the cushion,&#xD;
and the neat perfect toilette which my nephew delights in, and&#xD;
such a face ! By Jove, my boy, I'd have liked to be there. But&#xD;
how about the old lady ?  I used to be horribly afraid of' her.&#xD;
Poor Fred was a sad victim. This child has no Price about her."&#xD;
Uncle Alec chuckled. "She is priceless, uponrmy word. I blun-&#xD;
dered into it, Otho. I'd no intention of making a pun. I shall&#xD;
have to provide for you handsomely, my boy. I suppose the Pro-'&#xD;
fessor has not laid up much dross among his specimens, and I&#xD;
won't wait till I shuffle off this mortal coil. I'm only forty-&#xD;
five, and the Craigenfells are a long-lived race. I intend to&#xD;
divide between you and Bertha, you know, but I don't imagine a&#xD;
few thousands will come amiss anytime."&#xD;
Proud Otho winced, he bowed, and said quickly, with some&#xD;
haughtiness in his tone, " Whither are you bound, sir ? you've your&#xD;
face from Craigenfells. We thought you were sunk in the mine."&#xD;
"Well, so I was, child, till lately. I've come up to breath like a&#xD;
porpoise. In fact I'm looking about'for Yankee miners. I think&#xD;
I've secured one. I only saw him a few minutes; he's got a&#xD;
family as long as John Rogers, nine small children and)one out&#xD;
of breath ; he has dug up the silver lode and is poor enough for&#xD;
anything. So I gave him a fifty dollar greenback to settle" his&#xD;
family, and I am to take him up at Moose Missie when I go&#xD;
dlQwn"&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.              545&#xD;
They were all out on the platform by this time,, and Sabrina&#xD;
said, "Moose Missie ! Why, that's where Bertha's proteges left&#xD;
us. Had they a tremendous dog in the party ?"&#xD;
"Yes, a great cross fellow, that wrinkled up his .nose, and&#xD;
growled at me, but let the whole posse of young ones tumble, on&#xD;
him for nothing."&#xD;
" That's they," said Zoe. "I must tell you about it.".&#xD;
"Hold on Miss Walsingham," interrupted Chandy. "That's&#xD;
my story," and he told the tale without sparing himself in the&#xD;
least, withfgenerous, honest frankness, which did him credit.&#xD;
" Yes, yes, Bertha, well done, good child. Your kindness must&#xD;
be rewarded."  Uncle Alec dug his great white hand, on which&#xD;
he wore a vast ring of pure silver out of his own mine, into his&#xD;
pocket, and brought up a couple of gold eagles, which he put into&#xD;
Bertha's palm, taking it in his for the purpose, and closing her&#xD;
little fingers over the shining coins. "Good little heart, loves babies,&#xD;
loves finery too, buy some, books, ribbons, anything."&#xD;
" Oh," thought Belle, looking on, "Why can't he be my Uncle ?"&#xD;
Such an available old goose as he is. How can I manage to come&#xD;
in for some of those. What a casting of pearls, etc., when I am&#xD;
nearly destitute."&#xD;
" Uncle Alec," commenced Otho, "I am very sure that Bertha&#xD;
does not wish-"&#xD;
" You keep quiet Otho, my boy, don't meddle with matters too&#xD;
high for you. Don't you know that it is my mission to reward&#xD;
youthful piety ?"&#xD;
"If that is your fashion of doing it, won't Ibe pious then,"&#xD;
exclaimed Belle, tossing off her curls, and dimpling her face all&#xD;
over. Uncle Alec laughed and pinched her cheek..&#xD;
"You must show the first fruits before you think of the re-&#xD;
ward, beauty."&#xD;
"There goes a rag-muffin," exclaimed Belle, breaking away.&#xD;
,"Look at his poor bare feet; his 'coat 's got a hole in it so have&#xD;
his breeches.'. Give me an eagle to fit him genteelly, and send him&#xD;
to SundaySchool."&#xD;
- Uncle Alec pushed away her proffered hand, but he patted it&#xD;

softly first.  "That won't do, beauty. Charity vaunteth not&#xD;
itself."&#xD;
"They were all on their way to the cars, and Belle cast a spite.&#xD;
ful look at the unconscious Bertha. " I'll manage hipi yet," she&#xD;
thought. "If I had time, I'd marry him. He'd do twice as'&#xD;
good as old Soap Fut."&#xD;
There was a delay in the train. The road paid handsome div.&#xD;
idends,,but the company was too poor to lay a double track, and&#xD;
the shabby old cars they ran were 'a disgrace to civilization.&#xD;
Uncle Alec and Otho walked up and down the platform smoking.&#xD;
" I want about fifty 'men, and I want a thorough practical business&#xD;
nan more ; cool headed and efficient. Do you know I have thought&#xD;
more than once of trying to persuade George Blair. If it were&#xD;
not for' Ruth-I haven't got any wife myself," (a little shadow&#xD;
crossed his-face, chased by an odd smile as he finished his sen.&#xD;
tence,) " but I can feel for those who have. I wish you couple&#xD;
come, Otho: but it is a wild, harem-scarem life, not fit for you,&#xD;
besides I suppose you've something better. You hav'nt told me&#xD;
your plans yet."&#xD;
"I've something in hand this year, at all events," replied Otho,&#xD;
smiling. "I'm going to teach music at Rosenbloom."&#xD;
" For the Professor. Very right, very praiseworthy ; you can&#xD;
scarcely help a better man. Of course he can get teachers enough,&#xD;
but your German training ought to make ,an accurate musician&#xD;
'of you."&#xD;
"I flatter myself it has been of use; but I shall stay to please&#xD;
myself, not to benefit my -father."&#xD;
Uncle Alec looked ingniringly at the proud face which was all&#xD;
shut in and dark. ",Otho," said he impatiently, " such pride as&#xD;
yours is folly ! You think too highly of your powers ; here I've a&#xD;
couple of millions, and they go on repeating themselves, and you&#xD;
turn cold and haughty at the least mention of a gift from me. I&#xD;
take it unkindly. You deprive me of a pleasure."&#xD;
"The leopard cannot change his spots, Uncle Alec. Let's talk&#xD;
of .something else."&#xD;
"I'll settle a fortune on your wife. You can't hinder that, sir."&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITl'S DAUGITR.              547&#xD;
Oth6 smiled.  "Craigenfells is looking finely," said he.--&#xD;
" Thomas has done the honors grandly."&#xD;
" Dear old place ; I can stop only a couple of -days there. I've&#xD;
got to drum up my men and go under ground againlike .a gnome.&#xD;
As Uncle.Alec sees a vision of himself upon the broad veranda&#xD;
of ' San Christabel,' taking his ease in his bamboo chair, and over-&#xD;
looking his hacienda away out to the distant cerros, he smiles .at&#xD;
the ' Gnome.' By the time you are ready to take up&#xD;
'Domestic happiness, the only bliss&#xD;
Which has survived the fall,'&#xD;
I'll come up for good, and I'll have little Pet to light my pipe and&#xD;
work my slippers for me. How long shall it be? one year or&#xD;
two?"&#xD;
"Four at the least, sir. gliss Goldsmith wishes to study, and&#xD;
I must. establish myself in business."&#xD;
Uncle Alec made a grimace. "And you.propose to commence&#xD;
Iy teaching music. 'A wilfull man maun have his way.' You&#xD;
are proud of your strength, and .you abandon yourself in shear&#xD;
weakness to this love-dream. You cannot tear yourself away&#xD;
from little Pet. Better be careful; plenty of matches are spoiled&#xD;
by the parties seeing too much of each other. It is a severe or&#xD;
deal to live under the same roof."&#xD;
" Love that has got to last a life-time certainly can endure a&#xD;
twelve-month of companionship. I am not at all afraid. I have&#xD;
made up my mind; and don't change it easily."&#xD;
"Perhaps not," replied Uncle Alec .drily. "I was thinking&#xD;
little Pet might'see reason to change hers."&#xD;
Otho lookedsproud and astonished. Such a view of the case&#xD;
had never presented itself to" his, mind, and ,he ,dismissed it in-&#xD;
stantly as too .absurd for attention&#xD;
" Thinks a.great deal more of himself than he does .of little&#xD;
Pet," thought Uncle Alec, studying him; "-though .I don't sup,.&#xD;
pose anybody would see it under his grand courtesy ; but its so.&#xD;
Always was a masterful little chap, but a real true gentleman-&#xD;
good blood. I think a great deal of blood. I should like to be&#xD;

there when the old women begin to tell him their ails. I don't&#xD;
believe intense sympathy for short-comings or. fancied ills are&#xD;
among his virtues." He sighed as he glanced in at the car win-&#xD;
dow, where Chris' pretty face appeared in wrapt vision, following&#xD;
the erect young fellow's movements,--slowly pacing. While he&#xD;
looked, Zoe came and took off Chris' hat and tucked up a couple&#xD;
of stray curls and settled the- hair-pins, and he was struck. by the&#xD;
blackness which frowned on Otho's face, who had seen it too, and&#xD;
the exchange of kisses which followed. There was'nt much in&#xD;
it, but somehow Uncle Alec felt uneasy. "Fred's child is a,&#xD;
dreamer," he thought. " While the others are chatting and laugh-&#xD;
ing, she lives away among her thoughts. Paul and I had&#xD;
to look after Fred-at school. Dear old fellow ; how like she is&#xD;
to him!"&#xD;
Uncle Alec always walked proudly among his young people.&#xD;
There was Sabrina Bradshaw, his sister's fair daughter'; and the&#xD;
Goldsmiths, who might have been blood-kin to him if things&#xD;
had'nt gone .criss-cross; Jan, the scapegrace, Uncle Alec loved&#xD;
him, and Zoe Walsingham, she was Zipporah Clayton's daughter,&#xD;
and Zipporah was Paul's sister; and Alec and Paul had been like&#xD;
brothers; and he knew, though it was a secret to everyone else,&#xD;
that Elinor Walsingham had remained single for Paul's sake.&#xD;
He had cause to know, such cause as had sent him a wanderer up&#xD;
and down the world  these many years; such cause, that though&#xD;
the lady was stout and forty now, he could not touch her hand&#xD;
without sending the blood bounding through his veins. .&#xD;
And  the Groenveldts-there was'nt much family likeness be-&#xD;
tween madame and Uncle Alec, but they were brother and sister.&#xD;
Otho he knew thoroughly, but Bertha was comparatively a stran-&#xD;
ger to him. He had done his best to induce his sister to send&#xD;
her over to Germany when he took Otho, but she would not hear&#xD;
of- it; and now he went in and sat down by her and drew her&#xD;
out, and was thoroughly delighted with what he found. "And&#xD;
Chandy is a handsome fellow," he chuckled, and rubbed his hands&#xD;
and looked at Sabrina, serious and bright.  Though   Sam&#xD;
&#xD;
Slaughton was sitting by her, and she was looking at him, Uncle&#xD;
Alec somehow knew intuitively that she had never been in- love.&#xD;
They reached Rosenbloom about sunset. The last half-dozen&#xD;
miles of the journey being performed in the vast carry-all in&#xD;
which Madame Groenveldt's young ladies took their airings; and&#xD;
they had no' end of fun, sitting opposite each other on the long&#xD;
seats, while the driver rattled breakneck down the steep hills, and&#xD;
mixed them' into pie. Uncle Alec,' deaf to all entreaties, even&#xD;
Belle's, who coaxed her prettiest, had turned off at Bramble&#xD;
Junction, but compromised by promising to be present at the&#xD;
Christmas party, and bring Miss Elinor, always providing he was&#xD;
not under ground by that time.&#xD;
The first view of the great house, sitting in the valley, with its&#xD;
wide galleries ; its great observatory, where the Professor's tele-&#xD;
scopepointed nightly toward the silent stars ; its many-windowed&#xD;
extent and clustered off-shoots, green-houses, lecture-halls, bowling-&#xD;
alleys, billiard-rooms, barns, and stables, was very suggestive of&#xD;
good times, and as Otho and 'Bertha pointed out the various&#xD;
buildings and their uses, divers were the exclamations of pleasure&#xD;
they called out. Richly the' place deserved its fanciful name.&#xD;
Roses were a, specialty with the dear old Professor, and he had&#xD;
them all, from the choicest and rarest, to the common eglantine&#xD;
of the woods; and-his perpetuals were loaded with blooms.' They&#xD;
were on standards, on trellises, in"pots, in borders, all thrifty and&#xD;
beautiful. When the party approached near enough to °see the&#xD;
deep, still lake,lying at rest between the mountains; the tree-tops&#xD;
and clouds all radiant with the mystery of the golden light,&#xD;
though the sun had gone down ; the great grey rocks piled in fan-&#xD;
tastic heaps like giant's playthings ; the clear water-brooks, rush-&#xD;
ing and foaming down the hill-side from grassy springs away&#xD;
up among the shadows, where the white owls hoot. at evening ;&#xD;
the pretty basin before the windows, with its fountain and leaping&#xD;
trout; the sheep and lambs galloping along the meadows; the&#xD;
quiet cows biting the short grass ; and Shep, the huge wolfish-&#xD;
looking dog. with' great pointed ears and yellow eyes, come tear-&#xD;
ing along the road, his fox-brush of a tail waving over his striped&#xD;

back, barking deep hollow barks of greeting to his friends in&#xD;
harness; Chris turned to Otho with flashing eyes and laid her-&#xD;
hand on his with a little caress, a thing so unusual that Otho was&#xD;
quite startled.&#xD;
"Do you like Rosenbloom ?" asked he, imprisoning the small&#xD;
messenger which had spoken its owner's pleasure, and smiling&#xD;
down upon the animated face with one of his rare grave smiles,&#xD;
which lighted up his dark features like sudden sunbeams. "Do&#xD;
you like it, Sappho ?"&#xD;
"Oh yes, it is very lovely, and this evening is so perfect ; noth-&#xD;
ing wanting in earth or sky. I am sure I shall be very happy&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"Enough so to staytill I am ready to take you to my home,&#xD;
darling ? I should like this to be your home till you .come to&#xD;
mine."&#xD;
Chris turned her head away to hide the deep blush which&#xD;
would come ; and in a moment they were there.&#xD;
Bertha sprang out first, and was taken into her father's arms&#xD;
with a fond, quaint welcome. Then she went up to her mother.&#xD;
'I've brought them all in safe, mama, and in first-rate order."&#xD;
She waved her arm about towards the descending party. "Seven&#xD;
head of pupil! and here are Mr. Brown and Mr. Vedder, who&#xD;
have helped me keep watch."&#xD;
While madame was looking at Bertha, not clear as to the ab-&#xD;
solute propriety of her little speech, and the merry tone in which&#xD;
she gave it, Jan came up and made his bow.&#xD;
" We are a couple of famous sheep-dogs, madame, safe to be&#xD;
trusted among the tenderest kind of pupils."&#xD;
"Ma foi, yes," echoed Cymbaliiius-Adolphus, approaching and&#xD;
giving his hat a neat blow at the right juncture, just as the fel-&#xD;
low comes in on the triangles in the band: "Ma foi, yes,&#xD;
madame. I've made a widdle about it. Why is Chandds Gold-&#xD;
smith like-"&#xD;
Sauey Chandy patted him on the back. "Ah, Madame Groen-&#xD;
veldt, Cabby is some on widdles.&#xD;

&#xD;
'His years are young, but:his experience old,&#xD;
His head unmellowed, but his judgment ripe.'"&#xD;
"fLeave my coat alone, Goldsmith; I don't like that sort of&#xD;
thing, you know. It's a bore, it's a nuisance," said Cabby crossly.&#xD;
"Not like Bill Shakes, Cabby?  Take care ! he is a friend  of&#xD;
mine ; but just stand aside now, here comes the Silver Lake god-&#xD;
dess."&#xD;
Cymbalinus backed away disconsolately, with a dim idea of Bill&#xD;
Shakes as a shoulder-hitter with a bull-terrier at his heels, and&#xD;
stopd turning it over in his mind and glorifying himself that- he&#xD;
had always kept clear of such disreputable acqiaintances.&#xD;
Madame received her guests with business kindness, and sharp,&#xD;
comprehensive glances, which took in their whole get p, as she&#xD;
kissed the girls on both cheeks and shook hands With their es-&#xD;
corts.&#xD;
For the last ten minutes of th'e drive, Belle Brandon had kept&#xD;
her little round high heel planted on .Chris's frock, and had leaned&#xD;
her elbow on, her knee, and her head in her hand, to give it&#xD;
weight and steadiness, and when Chris rose quickly to give her&#xD;
hand to Otho, and sprang lightly out, her skirt gathers all gave&#xD;
way. Poor blear-eyed Scratch-hard had sewed them in at three&#xD;
o'clock in the morning, andin a desperate hurry, and it-was .tacky,&#xD;
too, for the fabric must else have had a fearful rent. As it 'was,&#xD;
the back breadths all parted. company with the body, and trailed in&#xD;
dreary draggle-tail fashion, as she presented herself to Madame,&#xD;
to be looked over.&#xD;
" Do gather up your rags, Cinderella," said Bellee in a clear&#xD;
voice; "you are the most unfortunate wretch! I wonder why&#xD;
it is ifanybody comes to   grief, it is invariably Christabel&#xD;
Goldsmith. How de do, Madame Groenveldt I've come to be&#xD;
your little girl now ; please keep a kiss for me, (putting up her&#xD;
mouth,) I love kisses; I've my lips all ready."&#xD;
Jan Vedder's mouth watered, and he only wished he could be&#xD;
there.&#xD;

&#xD;
Madame gave the required salute, but she looked daggers and&#xD;
knives at the rent garment, which Chris hastily clutched, backing&#xD;
against the wall.&#xD;
Belle laughed and pointed merrily at her, and Mary Ann tried&#xD;
to join as if she must, but couldn't quite enjoy it. Otho brought&#xD;
his eye-brows together in a black frown which covered the three,&#xD;
and Belle went up and twitched his sleeve, holding her sides.&#xD;
"What a guy she looks, doesn't she ?" said she.&#xD;
" What's amiss with your dress, Miss Goldsmith ?" asked mad.&#xD;
ame, severely; "come here, if you please."&#xD;
Chris came immediately, but looked so miserable that every.&#xD;
body felt sorry fob her, except the blonde beauty..&#xD;
"It caught in the. carriage, I think, as I jumped out."&#xD;
"Very. careless of you; always gather up your skirts before&#xD;
you get out of a carriage ; such heedlessness often causes terrible&#xD;
accidents. The sewing is lamentably faulty; faulty sewing is&#xD;
unladylike: I recommend you tp repair the mischief before you&#xD;
retire this evening. Never put off your duties; I require the&#xD;
utmost exactness and neatness from my young ladies, in attire, as&#xD;
well as everything else. We strive for perfection, keeping our&#xD;
standard high.&#xD;
Madame was all school-ma'am now-argus-eyed and armed in&#xD;
proof. She had two distinct natures: a charming lady, wife, and&#xD;
mother, out of harness, but when she buckled on her educational&#xD;
armor she was invincible.&#xD;
Otho walked away before she commenced her harangue, with&#xD;
Sam and Peter, keeping his anger under, and politely showing&#xD;
off the place; and Chandy went up and stood by Chris..&#xD;
"My sister has not been her own dress-maker, madame," said&#xD;
he, " but she is a rare needle-woman, and when she tries her skill&#xD;
you'll find her skirts will bear a heavy foot better. There is'one&#xD;
point in her character in which she is beyond your teaching;&#xD;
when reviled she answers not again."&#xD;
So saying, Chandy put Chris's unwilling hand within his arm,&#xD;
and walked off.&#xD;
Madame was astonished, displeased with the Goldsmiths, and a&#xD;

&#xD;
trifle, just a trifle put out with herself. She scarcely knew the&#xD;
secret feeling which led her to be so hard upon Chris, and&#xD;
the satisfaction she took in lecturing her before Otho. She never&#xD;
made apologies, that is, educationally, and she saw from the faces&#xD;
around her that they considered her unjust and unreasonably hard&#xD;
upon poor Chris for a mere accident, and she called after her, "rI&#xD;
think gou will be more careful next time, my dear," and then 'she&#xD;
rung the bell.&#xD;
" Have the goodness to admonish Miss Brandon to be less cai&#xD;
ful, madame," said Chandy, facing about and bowing low.&#xD;
Belle laughed. "He is' so full of jokes, madame," said she,&#xD;
She felt gay; she had given the two persons she disliked some.&#xD;
thing unpleasant to connect in their remembrance of the first.&#xD;
hour in' Rosenbloom, and put the whole party out of joint, and&#xD;
her face was radiantly beautiful, despite the dust and soil of travel,&#xD;
and her manner bewitchingly simple.&#xD;
"Miss Filer, young ladies. Miss Filer, you will have' the&#xD;
goodness to show these strangers to their rooms, and take care bf&#xD;
them; and allow me, young ladies, to recommend expeditious&#xD;
toilettes, as supper is waiting. Ah_! here comes Otho! Charm-&#xD;

you please; will you oblige me by seeing your friends safely p ro-&#xD;
vided ? -Au revoir, gentlemen, and speedily ; your old quarters,&#xD;
Otho, and Mr. Goldsniith next you."&#xD;
She dismissed them'with cordial courtesy, and" tried hard to&#xD;
smile away the unfavorable impression she had made, and scatter&#xD;
the gathering gloom.&#xD;
All went except Belle, who seated herself at the piano, after&#xD;
throwing her wrappings on one of the drawing-room chairs&#xD;
"I'm so fagged, I really don't feel equal to the effort of dress-&#xD;

"You will not be permitted to practice here, my dear," replied&#xD;
madame, with dignity; soothee maker or tone are of little conse-&#xD;
quence to you. There are a hundred pianos ii Rosenbloom, for&#xD;
the use of the young ladies, besides the harps, guitars, violins,&#xD;
&amp;amp;c., in the Professor's art school, and not an aggravating tm pan&#xD;
among them."&#xD;
"But I choose this one," said Belle, pouting willfully, and&#xD;
throwing up her eyes at madame, who had walked to hr side.&#xD;
"I like this room, I shall have to practice here ; I always have&#xD;
,ny way, everybody lets me."&#xD;
"We have fixed rules, my dear, as unchangeable as the laws&#xD;
of the Medes and Pe'rsians ; I can make no exceptions for you.&#xD;
You finger well, you must have been an attentive pupil."&#xD;
"I've had the best masters in New York; I should have been&#xD;
there now if my cross old frump of an aunt hadn't meddled."&#xD;
"That is not a proper style. of-speech about your relatives, my&#xD;
dear. Since they have thought best to place-you here, I hope you&#xD;
will be ,happy, and try to make progress. I expect ny young&#xD;
ladies to do their best-nothing less than that will content me."&#xD;
She closed the piano with an unruffled countenance, and rung.&#xD;
the bell.&#xD;
" Sarah, show this young lady to her room in the west corridor."&#xD;
Belle rose; she could not well do less, and she rose gracefully.&#xD;
She gazed full in madame's eyes an instant before she threw her&#xD;
arms around her neck with a beautiful impulse.&#xD;
"I'm a naughty child, but I haven't any mother ; I want you-&#xD;
to love me."&#xD;
"So I will" replied madame, melting at once; "I'll try to&#xD;
supply the mother-want, poor dove."&#xD;
"Oh thank you ;" Belle wiped her eyes. "I begin to be hap-&#xD;
py already."&#xD;
That's right, my child ; now go with Sarah," said madame,&#xD;
dismissing her with a pat on her plump shoulder.&#xD;
As soon as she got up stairs the  poor dove" called out&#xD;
sharply:&#xD;
&#xD;
«1Here youSarah, or whatever your name ,may be, take this&#xD;
shawl! and remember that it is. your place to offer- such service."&#xD;
"A vei-y beautiful girl," said madame to the dear old Professor.&#xD;
"Very stylish indeed ; a little self-willed or so, and a good deal&#xD;
spoiled,-but still very charming."&#xD;
"They are all beautiful." After the-first glance he had scarcely&#xD;
looked at Belle, and even seemed uneasy in her neighborhood ;&#xD;
"but the kleinefraulein Goldsmichd is the loveliest of all, in spite&#xD;
of her torn robe. She knows of Coleopteras, and can sing so !-'&#xD;
the Prof. put his finger to his lips, and rolled up his eyes--.words&#xD;
failed him,"&#xD;
"Why Belle Brandon!" called out Zoe, as that young lady&#xD;
appeared at her door, " where have you been ?"&#xD;
The girls had not got very far in dressing, but were discussing&#xD;
madame and their prospects, and some hard things had been said.&#xD;
"I've been taking madame's measure," said Belle, tossing off&#xD;
her curls.  She'll tell the clock to any business I say befits the&#xD;
hour,' (as that odious Chandy says,) with all her school-ma'am&#xD;
grandeur." She laughed lightly at their astonished faces.&#xD;
"Bring me some ice-water directly," (imperiously to Sarah,)&#xD;
" I shall bathe my face in it before I go down ; as I cannot get&#xD;
my bath of asses-milk to-night, I'll try and make it do; so make&#xD;
haste."&#xD;
She tossed off her curls, and clapped her hands, merrily ap-&#xD;
preciating the girls' bewildered faces, after poor, benighted Sarah&#xD;
had gone- down.&#xD;
Unlike most boarding schools, the -scholars at Rosenbloom were&#xD;
not coupled together in little rooms, but each had a nice quiet&#xD;
. apartment of her own, neatly furnished with a cottage set, and&#xD;
ensuring absolute privacy. None of the demoralizing cooping&#xD;
of the bad with the good in such positive juxtaposition as to en-&#xD;
force intimacy and ensure corruption. Each girl was required to&#xD;
keep her wardrobe in order ; each article had a place and must&#xD;
keep it, subject to thg supervision of sharp-eyed Filer, who looked&#xD;
so closely that not a shoe-lace could be away from home but. she&#xD;
pounced on it, and who gave failures and ciphers with a smack.&#xD;
of vast relish.&#xD;

The new-comers had a day of leisure before being required'&#xD;
commence study, in which to ramble about, and enjoy themselves,&#xD;
Peter, Cymbalinus, and Jan were to leave them the next morning,&#xD;
and the boarders were all invited into the drawing-rooms for what&#xD;
madame called 'a "social re-union," and very pleasant she made&#xD;
such parties to her pupils, providing excellent refreshments, and&#xD;
allowing them to enjoy their dancing and tete-a-tetes as if they&#xD;
had been her own children. Belle wrote down Cymbalinus Adol-&#xD;
phus under Jan Vedder in her note-book.&#xD;
"Come out on, the gallery with me, Zoe," said Peter, in a&#xD;
determined, straight-forwardl way. "I wish to speak alone with&#xD;
you."&#xD;
Zoe's color went and came, and she hung back. She knew&#xD;
well what she was about to hear, and fluttered, and sighed, and&#xD;
dreaded to give up her liberty.&#xD;
"I'm afraid' I shall take cold, Peter."&#xD;
" You were not afraid half an hour ago, when Chandy and you,&#xD;
walked there, arid there has. been no change in the weather since&#xD;
then-; I'll fetch your shawl."'&#xD;
"If you insist, I suppose I must, but if I fall ill you will be&#xD;
to blame."&#xD;
"I do insist-I'll take the responsibility."&#xD;
He put her shawl carefully about her shoulders, and took her&#xD;
hand within his arm, and. walked half a dozen times up and back,&#xD;
without a word; and, Zoe felt his heart beat against her arm, and&#xD;
so she began to grow restive and saucy under his hesitation, and&#xD;
tried to pull;away from him. He held her fast.&#xD;
"I'm going away in the morning, Zoe."&#xD;
" Did you bring nie out here to tell me that ? because if you did,&#xD;
I think I might as well go in again. Belle Brandon is =beginning&#xD;
to sing, and there is that Zambrano coming, I know he is looking&#xD;
for me."&#xD;
" Let her sing herself as hoarse as a raven, she can't have you&#xD;
for audience ; and as- for that Cuban, he can go and take up with&#xD;
her, she's made eyes enough at the fool. But never mind 1dm,&#xD;
Zoe, I brought you out here to ask you to promise yourself to&#xD;
&#xD;
me. I want to marry you, Zoe; you know how long I've loved&#xD;
you.; why I never cared for another girl when I was a little shav-&#xD;
er, and I've followed you about like a faithful dog ever since.&#xD;
You are fond of calling me a 'ridiculous fellow,' perhaps I am,&#xD;
but I love you, Zoe.; you will never find a chap who is up to&#xD;
everything who will be so true and tender to you as I will. Why,&#xD;
when you are sweet and good I just feel as if -I could take you&#xD;
in my arms and carry you over all the rough places, and never&#xD;
let anything hurt you; and -when you go on so like the fairy&#xD;
changling that Pauline reads about, (I always think of you, Zoe,&#xD;
so beautiful and so tantalizing-her own mother couldn't catch&#xD;
her,) and it seems as if there wasn't any love in you for anybody,&#xD;
and me especially, you take all the manhood out of me, so that I&#xD;
am not good for anything, nothing is pleasant to me, I can't put&#xD;
any heart into my 'work. You've been very hard on me since we&#xD;
left home, and I can't bear it any longer; I'm determined to make&#xD;
'an end of it. If you can't love me, I'll go home and try to live&#xD;
somehow, I don't know   how, I'm sure; of course it won't&#xD;
kill me ; I suppose the world would turn round just the same ;&#xD;
but oh, Zoe ! if you can .only just say one little word to me, such&#xD;
as I want to hear ! just look at me ! one'look will do. Look at&#xD;
me, Zoe ; I can read my fate in your eyes."&#xD;
He was so strong and earnest that Zoe was frightened,; and&#xD;
tried to step past him, and kept her eyes. fixed on the ground,:&#xD;
and gathered her shawl around her shoulders with trembling&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"Not now, let me go, they will be looking for us."&#xD;
"No," he replied, placing himself before her. "I must have&#xD;
my answer now.. You shall not go with my heart in your hand,;&#xD;
you shall speak. No, Zoe, do not try to get away from me, I am&#xD;
resolved."&#xD;
" What d6 you want me to say, then? - Don't1! you hurt my&#xD;
wrist."&#xD;
"Say you love me, Zoe !.Say you will be my wife!l Don't&#xD;
send me out into the great empty. world without anything to hope&#xD;
for. I Won't bother you about being married#; I will be patient;&#xD;

I can live a good while on the assurance that your heart is"safe in,&#xD;
my keeping, without asking for more. All your heart, all your&#xD;
love, I know you won't insult me with anything 'less than all.&#xD;
Dearest Zoe!"&#xD;
He putout his strong hand and tried to draw her to him; she&#xD;
trembled and fluttered, and turned her little head, looking for&#xD;
escape, and finding none, she raised her eyes, Which were full of&#xD;
unquiet light,.and met his, bent upon her, and saw that his face&#xD;
was white and his glance beseeching ; but still underlying his&#xD;
.modest self-depreciation there was manly strength, a certain pow-.&#xD;
erful repose ; and shining over all, the glory of his great love: and&#xD;
she let herself be drawn to his'arms.,&#xD;
"I shall vex and tease you all the same," said she with pout-&#xD;
ing lips. "I am not going to be a cooing dove, and I hate being&#xD;
engaged, its so stupid."&#xD;
"Very well, darling, then we'll go and get married. Pity Otho&#xD;
was'nt a Parson instead of a Dr. We might finish our engage-&#xD;
ment to-night, nothing could suit me so well."&#xD;
"INo indeed, sir ! not for two years at least. I'm to flirt and&#xD;
dance, with everybody and you are not to- say a word against it."&#xD;
My Zoe shall be guided as she always has been by her good&#xD;
sense and good feeling. What is that Chandy says? I've thought&#xD;
of you when I heard it."&#xD;
"'Tis not to make me jealous,&#xD;
To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,&#xD;
Is free of speech, sings, plays, dances well, 1&#xD;
Where virtue is, these are more virtues ;&#xD;
Nor from mine own weak merits will draw&#xD;
The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt,&#xD;
For she had eyes and chose me."&#xD;
"Hush,;you horrid Peter," said Zoe, blushing deep.  "'You've&#xD;
been learning that by heart on purpose to teaze me with it."&#xD;
"My 'Zoe, good, true, dear Zoe, how I. love you."  He was so&#xD;
brimming with joy, and held her so firmly, and rained down such&#xD;
passionate kisses upon her face, that she looked up half doubting&#xD;
&#xD;
his identity. It did not seem as if it could, be honest, steady&#xD;
oing Peter ; and she struggled to free herself.&#xD;
"Not yet, not yet. You are mine now, I must hold you a lit-&#xD;
tle more. Pretty soon you will go back into that room among&#xD;
all those people, and I shall be ever so far away from you, but I&#xD;
shall call you to me after a little while, and you must come be-&#xD;
cause you belong to 'me. Just one more, darling. Oh I have&#xD;
waited so long for this. I have earned it, hav'nt I Zoe? You&#xD;
cruel, wicked little beauty. Sam says you've twisted me round&#xD;
your finger. 'Tis a pretty little finger. Well, yes, I suppose you&#xD;
must go; but Zoe, I've such 'a pair of ponies breaking for you.&#xD;
They'll drive like lambs, and the wind can't catch them; and Zoe,&#xD;
there's a phaeton at Munger's, invisible green body, anddouble&#xD;
'springs, just the thing for them ; how pretty you will look, driv-&#xD;
ing them., I'm so fond of your smart bright ways. Tell. me&#xD;
something I can do for you."&#xD;
" Oh you ridic,---"began Zoo through tears and smiles.&#xD;
" Say it, Zoe. I don't mind it now. You are mine. Youlove&#xD;
me. Im so happy, dear. Are you happy?"&#xD;
Zoo dropped a quick soft kiss upon his hand, and darted away;&#xD;
but she did not appear in the parlor any more, and honest Peter&#xD;
went in and sat down in the corner, and smiled at the; carpet and&#xD;
hugged his joy, and could hardly believe 'it was all done and-ixed.&#xD;
The next morning, the young men went away. Poor Cymba-&#xD;
linus too down-hearted even, to originate a conundrum.: Jan Ved-&#xD;
der with a little glovein his pocket, smelling of heliotrope, which&#xD;
he had exchanged for a flashing ruby, worth a plum, which had&#xD;
gleamed on the finger of one of his Holland grandmothers and&#xD;
counted himself a gainer by the operation, and rosy 'cheeked&#xD;
Peter, his head erect, and his manly heart full of plansfor little&#xD;
Zoe's happiness-Zoe, who stood tearful and saucy, waiving her&#xD;
white handkerchief after him-and then they all turned to the busi-&#xD;
ness of the little world which they were to inhabit for a year. and a&#xD;
day. The five- hundred scholars were soon arrived, and the school-&#xD;
room settled to its regular routine. Chris was youngest of them&#xD;
all, and being sorely deficient- in the text-book knowledge which&#xD;

teachers call education, she was obliged to apply herself assid-&#xD;
uously. She found- mathematics "no go."  She could not make&#xD;
head or tail of them, and after putting her best energies to the&#xD;
proof, after secret struggles, and headaches innumerable, she re-&#xD;
solved in desperation to carry her troubles to Professor Noble,&#xD;
and make a clean breast of it, and ask for absolution. Belle&#xD;
considered her a shining mark for her sarcasm, and pointed her&#xD;
out with whispered comments to the girls, when she rose to make&#xD;
one of her blundering recitations, where X plus Y minus Z was&#xD;
never equal to anything in particular,. and A was always an un-&#xD;
known quantity: said girls tittering and grinning as those hard&#xD;
hearted wretches always will. And Miss Belle did not pursue&#xD;
her amusement with the less perseverance because the Professor&#xD;
discovered her one day with a key in her lap,.and made her stand&#xD;
at the board .during the recitation and work out her examples in&#xD;
the presence of the class. She rose gracefully, and spread out her&#xD;
skirts and stepped forth, unruffled in appearance, delighted with&#xD;
the opportunity of being consciously beautiful, and sure of sym-&#xD;
pathy from the masculines, and she enriched her work with a&#xD;
spirited caricature of Chris and the Professor, each in spectacles,&#xD;
their noses touching, which she .stood aside just long enough for&#xD;
the class toy-see; and extinguished with her sponge, almost be-&#xD;
fore ,the explosive burst of laughter greeted the ears of the only&#xD;
two persons.in the room who had not seen the show. Though the&#xD;
irate Professor inquired .diligently, he could get no reason for&#xD;
the mirth, that is, nothing, satisfactory to himself, for there were&#xD;
whimsical causes assigned as plenty as blackberries.&#xD;
Chris felt the keenest mortification at her dullness, and limited&#xD;
capacity, yet when history or the natural sciences formed the theme,&#xD;
or language, the class hung or her words delighted. Professor&#xD;
Noble had been silently observent of her struggles and her des-&#xD;
pair, and carefully studying the bias and complexion of her mind,&#xD;
he was waiting for the time to help her. He was one of the few&#xD;
teachers who think it worth while to follow the leading of nature&#xD;
in developing the powers God bestowed,'instead of striving to bring&#xD;
up All to the same .line and level, He .,fitted his culture to the&#xD;
&#xD;
peculiar conformation of his pupils' intellect, and with the happiest&#xD;
result. He saw that i --would be labor lost to put Chris through&#xD;
mathematical training, besidesspoiling her school-life and making&#xD;
her wretched; because God in his wisdom had not seen fitto bestow&#xD;
on her the right kind of intellect. He therefore willingly consent-&#xD;
ed to allow her fine energies to expand in other directions, loving-&#xD;
ly, grandly. "You must do arithmetic enough to keep your&#xD;
household accounts, and buy your dry goods," said he,'" and that&#xD;
will have to content us. If you wish it, I will, myself write - to&#xD;
your friends my ideas on'the subject, and make it 'easy for you."&#xD;
"It will not be necessary, sir," said 'Chris, dropping: her eyes,&#xD;
"I am at liberty to pursue such course of study as you shall ap-&#xD;
prove."&#xD;
The. Professor leveled his glasses at her in surprise. Her sor-&#xD;
rowful accent and downcast flushing face, set him, thinking. After&#xD;
that he was always tenderly 'kind -to his new scholar, and delight-&#xD;
ed himself greatly in her rare gifts, and in giving her the hardest&#xD;
tasks, to which she sprang joyously. No labor was too much.&#xD;
No application too severe, and he opened his eyes in wonder every&#xD;
day at the stores of miscellaneous learning he found, and he&#xD;
caressed his Phi Delta Kappa key, with his favorite twirl, hugely&#xD;
enjoying himself in listening, after setting her off on some dar-&#xD;
ling theme.   Her dreamy eyes, now    sparkling, now humid,&#xD;
and her flexible voice, never loud, but its intonations fine and&#xD;
clear as a bobolink's song, her English of the choicest and simp-&#xD;
lest, and her self-forgetfulness absolute.  A sudden still ness&#xD;
always prevailed. Even Chandy left off stealing hair-pins fr6n&#xD;
Sabrina's amber braids, who sat in front of him, and Zoe indited&#xD;
no notes and. drey no caricatures, till Chris sat down ; often&#xD;
dropping into her place and pursuing the theme in her thoughts.&#xD;
Belle sometimes got up a little-laugh at her oddities, twisting&#xD;
her handkerchief for instance, a habit which still clung to her ;&#xD;
but it was'nt much; and the time was a golden harvest for our&#xD;
Chris. All her clothes were new and perfect, and she needed&#xD;
little thought, to look. well dressed.. Otho kept his word, and&#xD;
drilled her faithfully on the violin, and she had all the early morn-&#xD;

English composition. Besides there were prizes for declamation&#xD;
and different recitations, from the other teachers, all valuable and&#xD;
choice. ' Both the young gentlemen and ladies were to compete&#xD;
for them, and of course there was a vast deal of table-talk on&#xD;
the subject. The meals at Rosenbloom were gay affairs. The&#xD;
young men were scattered about among the girls, and required "to&#xD;
attend to the little courtesies of the table with scrupulous exactness.&#xD;
Madame permitted no infringement or neglect from the sitting&#xD;
down to the rising up. When she detected any such, she called&#xD;
the' offender to her private room and read him or her a. lecture,&#xD;
so kind and judicious, but withal so 'imperative, that' there was&#xD;
little danger of a lapse. She sat at the head of the table, and the&#xD;
dear old Professor opposite,- and promoted social and pleasant in-&#xD;
tercourse, helped by enjoyment of excellent appetizing food, pre-&#xD;
pared in the best manner, and handsomely served. Deborah,&#xD;

though she sent many boxes of goodies to Chris, which the girls&#xD;
rifled ruthlessly, and troubled herself a good 'deal about her&#xD;
condition, would not have felt any fears if she could have inspect-&#xD;
ed the Rosenbloom housekeeping. She could have scarcely done&#xD;
it better herself, and that is high praise. Madame was splendid&#xD;
and grand in all her arrangements, both from choice and policy.'&#xD;
The grand Christmas party was in anticipation. The particu-&#xD;
lar festivity of the year, and looked forward to through all the&#xD;
last-half as a great occasion. They were accustomed to call it a&#xD;
christmas party, because it commenced their holidays, but really&#xD;
it 'was four days before, so as to give the scholars time to return&#xD;
to their several homes before the precious time of "good gifts to&#xD;
men."  Dresses were gotten down and commented upon, and dis-&#xD;
cussions of fabrics and styles ran'glibly from these nimble tongues&#xD;
to whom a party was still a "party," and whose absolute seclusion&#xD;
magnified the importance of all events in their little world.&#xD;
Belle Brandon went about from room to room, enjoying her&#xD;
favorite amusement of pulling over the girls finery, trying on&#xD;
their dresses, and appropriating to her own use articles which she&#xD;
could coax or buglel" into her possession. Belle stood well in the&#xD;
school-room; she was one of those showy, dashing scholars, who&#xD;
are the delight of such teachers as revel in examinations. There&#xD;
she shone resplendent-never dashed or put off her balance by&#xD;
anything. By dint of coaching, borrowing, and rapid study, she-&#xD;
was always ready to elicit applause from the audience.&#xD;
She and Chris were among the finest vocalists in the school,&#xD;
and were to sing a duet together graduation day, and she nearly&#xD;
drove her prima wild in their practice, by her false singing&#xD;
and ear-splitting screams, looking all the time as blandly uncon-&#xD;
scious as innocence itself; and when Chris, provoked beyond&#xD;
measure, darted away from the piano, and scolded and abused&#xD;
her, and declared she couldn't and wouldn't bear it, Belle would&#xD;
sit dowin and begin some ballad or romaunt, and render it with&#xD;
such true pathos as would arrest her flying footsteps, and hold-&#xD;
her with the door-knob in her hand perhaps, till it was finished.&#xD;
Then Belle would slip away and bring back somebody to look at&#xD;

and laugh at her plunged in a dream of troubadours and Provence&#xD;
maids. There was no danger of failure, though, for both sang at&#xD;
sight, and sang well.&#xD;
My lord Chandos had made up his mind, after much talking,&#xD;
and many smokes over the topic, to go across the big pond, and&#xD;
had persuaded Sam to accompany him, being, as Sam had whim-&#xD;
sically put it, " both brought up by hens," and masters of them-&#xD;
selves, all they had to do was to mature their intentions and exe-&#xD;
cute them.&#xD;
Perhaps one reason why Sam was so ready to cut loose from&#xD;
Rosenbloom was that Sabrina- well, I don't know-I can't tell&#xD;
-but he certainly did say, when .he saw her bending over the&#xD;
billiard table, with her eyes on the red ball, and her pretty fingers&#xD;
guiding the cue-well!&#xD;
" What care I how fair she be ?&#xD;
So she be not fair for me."&#xD;
'But perhaps after all he was not in love, for he was as genial&#xD;
and pleasant as ever, and they were excellent friends.&#xD;
'Bertha sighed in secret over the proposed trip, which.was the&#xD;
theme of so much talking in her presence; but she listened' with&#xD;
sympathizing face, and ran to the-school--oom when she was sent&#xD;
after maps, and rubbed up her French on purpose to look over&#xD;
the same page of the "Guidechaix," and read aloud the objects of&#xD;
interest they would have to visit.&#xD;
As usual, Master Chandy had been sailing easily along,.in the&#xD;
very middle of .the current, a favorite with everybody, his horses&#xD;
at their service, confidential and devoted to every pretty girl he&#xD;
found at his elbow ; precise and clear in his scholarship, without&#xD;
ever seeming to study. :ie and Sam had departed from their&#xD;
original lofty intention ;of confining, themselves to the art and&#xD;
music school, and they took studies which the;girls were pursuing,&#xD;
for the pleasure of flirting and =writing notesIto their favorites, as&#xD;
much as from any eagerness after knowledge; and poor, dreary&#xD;
Filer got nearly frantic sometimes over Chandy's quips and quib-&#xD;
bles, his Shaksperean quotations, and.questions so' easy to ask and&#xD;

difficult to answer, and she bestowed failures right and left, as her&#xD;
only safety-valve. She tried argument, but he%'left her stranded&#xD;
high and dry in no time.&#xD;
Prof. Noble enjoyed him ever so much, and Chris followed&#xD;
their class-talk with smiling eyes, and a little absent prompt once&#xD;
in a while, when a hard name slipped from the memory of either.&#xD;
But' Chandy's dearest "mate " was the dear old Professor, dating,&#xD;
oddly enough, from a practical joke at his expense played off by&#xD;
the audacious youngster soon after his. advent at Rosenbloom.&#xD;
Besides being a zealous cultivator of roses, the Professor grew&#xD;
pears con amore, and half the dark cupboards in the house were&#xD;
filled with the ripening ,specimens in fruiting time, besides the&#xD;
drawers in his bureau, which were emptied of his shirts and cnom-&#xD;
panion wearables, to give place to Bon Cretans, Flemish Beauties,&#xD;
and other interlopers, while the rightful occupants, were huddled&#xD;
out of sight anyhow, as of very minor importance.&#xD;
He had one tall tree which, though it grew and grew like Jack's&#xD;
bean-stalk, had not as yet done anything else, and having already&#xD;
over-topped the roof-tree of the great mansion, it was climbing&#xD;
still.- Chandy discovered the old fellow one day in his dressing-&#xD;
gown and tasseled cap, (his favorite costume,) standing beneath&#xD;
it, his hands crossed in his wide sleeves, his face lifted, gazing re-&#xD;
proachfully up among the shining green.&#xD;
"Ah," said. he, in plaintive accents, "why will you still refuse,&#xD;
ungrateful,. to bestow on me eine-kieinie birne, to reward all my&#xD;
care and love ?  Others, not half so well tended, yield of their&#xD;
increase, but thou, ungrateful, mockest all my toili!"&#xD;
Candy moved softly away. That evening he procured a rosy&#xD;
cheeked, long-necked. "Dix," ran a wire through the stem, and&#xD;
fastened it skillfully among the topmost branches.&#xD;
The next morning, bright and early, he and Sam were at their&#xD;
window, watching the coming steps of the Professor, in his reg-&#xD;
ular stroll among his garden aAd orchard pets. Soon he came&#xD;
slowly along, picking a leaf here, caressing a branch there, gath-&#xD;
ering -a-posey of late- flowers, a breakfast offering, to madaie,&#xD;
a fashion he had always held from the time of his betrothal. He&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.              567&#xD;
stopped, as usual, beneath his favorite, because his most thriftless,&#xD;
handsome tree, and raised his noble old face, smiling and thought-&#xD;
ful. Suddenly his eye caught something high up among the&#xD;
shining green, which arrested his attention.. Could it be that all&#xD;
his care.was to be rewarded at last ? a healthy, perfect fruit,&#xD;
hanging slyly there, growing and ripening in secret! It was like&#xD;
a miracle ! and he thought he knew every branch, nay, every&#xD;
quivering leaf, by heart. He took off his' glasses, wiped them&#xD;
hastily on his coat-sleeve, and looked eagerly upward.&#xD;
" It is ! it is ! iPomona be thanked ! I have it at last, a true&#xD;
'Dix!"&#xD;
He dropped his posey, and ran breathless for his long fruit-&#xD;
ladder; mounted higher ! higher ! panting with excitement. It&#xD;
was within his reach! his fingers grasped it! he pulled softly, tei-&#xD;
derly, it was so lusciously ripe! -But it did not yield to his ca-&#xD;
ressing touch ; he pulled harder, still it' did: not come. -He&#xD;
carefully mounted the next rung of his uncertain ladder, and&#xD;
brought 1his glasses to bear.&#xD;
"Ah! Gott in Himmel! vas -is das, so, so? It has de stem for&#xD;
the vire ! 'Tis von treek ! von prangk ! but I shall eat .it all the&#xD;
same."  And carefully untwisting it, and turning cautiously&#xD;
about and bringing his back against the ladder, he slowly melted&#xD;
the juicy lusciousness into his mouth with absolute enjoyment.&#xD;
"Vara goot, vara goot indeedt," said he, bowing many times, and&#xD;
drawing out his-vast bandana to wipe his lips; " thangs, mine un-&#xD;
knowndt friendt."&#xD;
A burst of hearty laughter from naughty Chandy in the window&#xD;
close by him, pointed the moral and adorned the tale, and the'Pro-&#xD;
fessor shook his fist good-naturedly at him as he descended.; That&#xD;
evening he sent a dish of magnificent Bartletts, with his compli-&#xD;
ments to the young .gentlem-an, which put. an effectual period to&#xD;
exploits in that line, and they were -fast friends thenceforth.&#xD;
Though so many months shut up 'in this school-world, Chris&#xD;
remained a stranger and .an alien among these five hundred young&#xD;
people, the Roaring Riverites being still almost' her only friends.&#xD;
They moved before her, and went and came, like shadows, scarce-&#xD;

ly jostling her in her course. If any of them addressed her she&#xD;
replied concisely ; if they asked assistance she rendered it prompt-&#xD;
ly, and felt relieved when they left her alone again. Though all&#xD;
respected her abilities, none asked her friendship; as for cronies&#xD;
and chums, she had no definite appreciation of the terms.&#xD;
Something very like a miracle had happened to her-she had&#xD;
conquered algebra, under Otho's teaching, who was absolute,&#xD;
would accept no apology, acknowledge no inability. Prof. Noble&#xD;
said it must be magnetism or love, and his sly eyes twinkled&#xD;
through his glasses as he said it in the softest, smoothest voice&#xD;
imaginable; and he made a quaint joke about a E.xolaaurtxo, which&#xD;
he supposed would go over Chris's head, and didn't. But neither&#xD;
of the gentlemen knew what labor she had undergone to please&#xD;
her imperious betrothed. She conquered as by fire.&#xD;
As an essayist and contributor to the Chip Basket, she was&#xD;
much sought after, and though Filer cut up her pieces when she&#xD;
could, and marked out all the-fire and point when she dared, they&#xD;
were always applauded, and her little poems had the, trick and&#xD;
knack of drawing tears sometimes, as they used among the. dear&#xD;
lovers at home ; and the young gentlemen were fond of spearing&#xD;
questions at -'. G., hoping to entangle her in her talk, su.h as-&#xD;
"Who brought the good news from Ghent to Aix ?" and " Who&#xD;
said the Venitian women were mezzo camo, mezzo lingo, (half.&#xD;
flesh, half wood,) and why ?"  "What is the tradition.of Herne's&#xD;
oak, and where did it stand ?"  "What kin was the heir of Lnne&#xD;
to John o' the Scales ?" - To all which C. G. returned ready and&#xD;
concise answers in the coming paper, so clearly and beautifully&#xD;
worked up, as to afford unmixed delight to the hearers-teachers,&#xD;
scholars, and invited guests.&#xD;
One of her Communications, "A Chapter on By-Words," made&#xD;
a great stir, and she got some ill-natured comments from parties&#xD;
who felt hit, but it was productive of good, for it originated a&#xD;
"Society for the. preservation of the English language in purity,"&#xD;
and they had great fun in making up lists of tabooed words, and&#xD;
collecting fines from offenders._&#xD;
Chris was doubly. wrapped just now, for besides competing for&#xD;
&#xD;
the prizes, she was working for something she greatly coveted.&#xD;
The dear old Professor had offered a year of free tuition, in-&#xD;
cludine board and other expenses, in his art school, to the pupil&#xD;
whose reports showed best scholarship. Luckily scholarship and&#xD;
deportment were reckoned separately, or poor Chris would have&#xD;
had slender chance. Belle took malicious pleasure in pointing&#xD;
out all her shortcomings and careless slips to Filer; unnecessary&#xD;
trouble on her part, for the thin teacher's eyes were of gimlet&#xD;
sharpness as well as size, and she always pounced on unfortunate&#xD;
Chris with vast relish. Never was a glove or shoe, out of place&#xD;
but Filer was sure to find it out. Poor sharp-faced, red-nosed&#xD;
Filer! whom the girls led such a life, and whose days were like&#xD;
Mr. Mantilini's, " one demnition grind."  She particularly disliked&#xD;
Chris ; she thought she held her up to ridicule because she quite&#xD;
unconsciously tripped up her stale facts, and blew away the little&#xD;
pet scraps of showy, threadbare learning, which were her power in&#xD;
her classes, and gladly would she have welcomed a flaw in her&#xD;
recitations, and closely did she watch for a chance at her.&#xD;
Madame regarded Chris curiously, and veered strangely in her&#xD;
feelings and conduct toward her. In class she could not suffi-&#xD;
ciently commend her. She treated her with absolute respect, and&#xD;
always spoke of her to the pupils as a bright example of scholar-&#xD;
ship.  Otherwheres, she was- cold, sour, exacting, and often&#xD;
haughty. So long as Otho stayed it was all smooth and pleas nt&#xD;
*   enough, though she pretefided no fondness even in'his presence.&#xD;
In fact their acquaintance made no advance, for Chris never spoke&#xD;
an unnecessary word where- she was, or looked at her when' she&#xD;
could look otherwheres. After six happy weeks Otho obeyed an&#xD;
urgent appeal from his old friend to come quickly, as he had got&#xD;
a warning in the shape of 'a stroke which left his right hand use-&#xD;
less ; and he desired to set his house in order preparatory to the&#xD;
long journey; and so he left his place unwillingly, breaking in&#xD;
upon the pleasant 'routine, and going inth exile for an uncertain&#xD;
period. Alas! with his departure, it must be told that Chris re-&#xD;
turned to her old careless never-mind fashions; insensibly, but&#xD;
surely, one torn article was replaced by another; holes were pii-&#xD;

ned up, and gathers tucked in, and in these last days of hard&#xD;
study and, close practice, Sabrina and Zoe had enough to do, and&#xD;
left her to herself. She never forgot to write to Deborah, how-&#xD;
ever, and every Saturday saw a long letter dispatched to her good&#xD;
friend, which was,read over and over by the worthy couple, and&#xD;
served for the theme of their fire-side talk all. the week through.&#xD;
Chris did not study in the school-room, but went and came&#xD;
with her class, and locked her own apartment against all intruders.&#xD;
Meanwhile Otho, busy among his papers, (he was looking over&#xD;
the business which his friend desired him to have,),would cease&#xD;
from:his labors and -let his thoughts flit back to Rosenbloom,&#xD;
holding in his hand one of her delightful epistles, feasting his soul&#xD;
upon it ;, so racy, witty, comprehensive, epigrammatic: ever fresh,&#xD;
ever nev. -He thought of her as he saw her up at Craigenfells,&#xD;
in her quaint black satin and little frilled apron, and the Sappho&#xD;
knot, 'around which were wound such pleasant memories; at the&#xD;
horseback party, in habit of ancient cut, and dainty gauntlets, as&#xD;
if she might have owned a merlin on her wrist, and of the good&#xD;
.understanding she had conquered for herself with wild Zephyr;.&#xD;
of the sick-room days, when she had shown him so unconsciously&#xD;
the ,depth and sweetness of her woman's nature ; and still oftener&#xD;
of ,the last evening at Rosenbloom, when, perfected under Sa-&#xD;
brina's friendly touch, she came down to his side, so shyly beau-&#xD;
tiful, sodelicately lady-like, and he had whispered, with a caress,&#xD;
as he placed her before the long mirror and showed her how&#xD;
lovely she was, "Promise me, Sappho, always to lookalike this;"&#xD;
and she had promised, and meant to keep her word-meant to,&#xD;
and did not ; alas ! for the wicked grip, the giant Habit holds.&#xD;
And Mr. Otho was never weary of telling, himself how richly&#xD;
endowed his darling was, how soul-satisfying in conversation, how'&#xD;
shy and daring, how stately and playful, how childish and woman-&#xD;
ly she could be by turns, and how unexpectedly she would flit&#xD;
from one state to the other, all and only for him; and he found&#xD;
himself recalling her remarks, her apt quotations. He took up&#xD;
a new book, and as he read she came and sat by him, and he laid&#xD;
down the volume, and resting his chin in his hand, he seemed&#xD;

living over an autumn evening. Without-the dead leaves flute&#xD;
tearing in the wind, and the sober grey rocks and many-tinted&#xD;
mountains keeping watch over the Iake-rippled and streaked wkh&#xD;
foam; the old weather-cock on the great hay barn, shifting and&#xD;
twirling, unsettled in his mind.  Within-a light fire on the&#xD;
library hearth, and he, Otho, in an arm chair smoking and watch.&#xD;
ing the face he loves best, bent' over an open volume. Presently&#xD;
she closes it, and rises with,- a discontented sigh, and comes and&#xD;
stands at the other corner of the hearth, and crosses her arms and&#xD;
gazes into the coals.&#xD;
."Have you finished, Sappho ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I believe so, and though I know it must be rank heresy,&#xD;
I heartily wish I had my two dollars in my hand again. Is it&#xD;
not passing strange' that a .strong-minded woman who evolves&#xD;
startling theories which bewilder and astonish the wise ones, and&#xD;
cause them to wag their heads in terror, and who lives and dis-&#xD;
ports herself in an atmosphere of her own creation, should be&#xD;
afraid of a poor little black-eyed mouse, playing harmlessly about&#xD;
her chamber, and should think it worth while to tell the public&#xD;
all about it, and how she sat up in bed, sleepless, dreading an at-&#xD;
tack, and threw her pillows at it ; and there- is another chapter,&#xD;
where all the wit turns upon th supposition that the mice have&#xD;
grown to be rats."&#xD;
" Would it not be more modest to suppose a want of apprecia-&#xD;
tion in yourself?"'&#xD;
" Would it not have been more sensible of her to tuck herself&#xD;
quietly into bed and pleasant dreams, and left the harmless mice&#xD;
to their revels ?"&#xD;
Then Mr. Otho remembered the true tale he had told her of a&#xD;
German mouse, which used'to come out and dance every evening&#xD;
when he and his friend Max played their violins: and how glee-&#xD;
fully she 'laughed, and what pointed questions she asked him about&#xD;
Max' young sister, who danced with him 'at the balls,' and how-&#xD;
they had wound up the evening-with a lesson on the Trois temrs,.&#xD;
and how she had promised to dance it with him at the Christmas&#xD;
party and keep it; asecret from everybody. Proud Otho danced&#xD;

like a gentleman, and taught Chris as he did algebra and the vio-&#xD;
lin and a host of things, after she overcame her awe of him and&#xD;
leai'ned to trust him; and he said, "I will not have that.old ani-&#xD;
mal who calls himself a Frenchman pulling my Chris about, and&#xD;
looking at her out of. his wicked old eyes, like an ancient spider&#xD;
whose web is complete."&#xD;
But after all, it was with the dear old Professor that Chris&#xD;
came out in the fullest richness of her powers. She loved hire&#xD;
so dearly, and had 'such a tacit-understanding with him. As in&#xD;
water, face answereth to face, she knew what every glance meant,&#xD;
and every tap of his fore-finger on his lip when he was accustomed&#xD;
to say "'so so ;" and she watched to see him tumble his hair fran-&#xD;
tically over her drawings, because then she knew she would have&#xD;
torrents of hard words launched at her presently, and absurd&#xD;
threats of terrific punishments to freeze the blood, which would&#xD;
make her laugh heartily. He had a St.'Alexis she was fond of&#xD;
copying, in his pilgrim hat and staff, and she begged him to per-,&#xD;
mit her to put it upon canvas.&#xD;
" Indeed, my master, I can do it," said she, hanging over him&#xD;
as he worked 'at his great Mythological picture, for, like all(paint-&#xD;
ers who love their art; he had a favorite dream he was striving to&#xD;
embody, and turned to it-from his duties for rest and- enjoyment,&#xD;
though no pupil except Chris ever saw him put brush to it.&#xD;
He shook his head and shrugged his shoulders. Chris straight-&#xD;
ened his cap over his gray curls. "Nay, my master, it is not&#xD;
seemly for you to wear your tassel so low. The rollicking style&#xD;
does not suit you. .You could never run with'the masheen. And&#xD;
do-not put me down so decidedly. My own papa gave me some&#xD;
lessons."  (She grew more earnest as she went on.)  "I feel sure&#xD;
I can do it. I know a good deal about colors ; I remember the&#xD;
names of nearly all papa used ; he used to let me bring them to&#xD;
him, and I have seen him mix them, the Biacca, and Azzura di&#xD;
Terra, and the Verditto. Papa liked Italian names and fashions,&#xD;
and I helped him fix his oils in their water-baths, and set them&#xD;
in the sun, and heat his varnish to keep his pictures-from bloom-&#xD;
ing."-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
" Ah! so, so; blooming;' vas is das, fraulein ?  Explain if&#xD;
you please," said the Professor, stopping to look through 'his&#xD;
tubed hand at the Hesperis matronalis (Dames' violet) he was.&#xD;
working up petal by petal in the vase which it was his fancy to&#xD;
introduce close to the Cathedra occupied by his bride. And&#xD;
showing his face to her afterwards, so clear-eyed and uiet, that&#xD;
she had no idea of the secret amusement she was affording him,&#xD;
and she went on airing her knowledge, extremely anxious to&#xD;
prove herself worthy to copy they St. Alexis.&#xD;
" Ah, master! faithless, unbelieving ! you think I am not able;&#xD;
but I assure you I do not forget anything papa, told me. I loved&#xD;
him so much, and the 'life up in his studio was so pleasant, when&#xD;
he talked to me about his art. I should have painted figures be-&#xD;
fore this time if he had lived, I am sure. He would have let me&#xD;
copy anything I asked."&#xD;
" Ah, ja, ja, fraulein. . Good child, I am going to be the kind&#xD;
master to my little pupil, but.I must hear about the ' blooming'&#xD;
first."&#xD;
"'It is the fault of the varnish, the bloom. It is like the look of&#xD;
a ripe grape or a plum, and spoils the transparency of the coloring&#xD;
-makes it clouded. Moisture does it, either in the picture or&#xD;
the varnish, and is best prevented by applying it hot, first taking&#xD;
care to dry the tints; and you can remove it with a soft sponge,&#xD;
dipped in hot oil of'  , oh dear, what was it now."  Chris put&#xD;
up her hand to her forehead and thought.&#xD;
' Was it bitter almonds ? That is 'what ladies use sometimes,&#xD;
mixed with bi-chlorate of mercury and ammonia. They think&#xD;
it will give them a bloom; but it is a- very un-pious delusion.&#xD;
They are sure to find it so after a trial. Now you did not know&#xD;
that, fraulein, I'll engage, for all you are so- vara much learned&#xD;
in art."&#xD;
"No, my master, those matters are too high for me.. But may&#xD;
I not copy the ' Alexis?"'&#xD;
"Ja, fraulein;' here is' a canvas ready mounted. You shall&#xD;
commence directly."  He meant all the while to consent, but he&#xD;
loved to see her changing face go 'through its moods, and hear&#xD;

her clear voice begging him, and feel her, light touch upon his&#xD;
shoulder and .hand, before he gave in. He loved .her. like a&#xD;
daughter, and he turned from his work to smile at her bent figure&#xD;
as she sat in her favorite corner of his studio, absorbed and happy.&#xD;
She gave her saint every odd minute of time, and worked early&#xD;
and late,- carefully covering it away behind Herr Groenveldt's&#xD;
" Dream" when she had to leave it.&#xD;
" Ah!" said the Professor, one twilight, when she had nearly&#xD;
completed it, and he bent over to inspect it for. the first time.&#xD;
 Ah1so so. You call this St. Alexis. The. Pilgrim hat and&#xD;
staff are his, ja, ja, so are the flowing garments, but the face&#xD;

But this is not your first sketch of the Saint. In your portfolio&#xD;

Chris stopped his mouth with her hand, and her cheek burned,&#xD;

that would be--how call you it-incongruous. The picture has&#xD;
great perfection, just the gray rock, and mossy wall.. The Alexis&#xD;
is admirable' a most grand figure. Ah Fraulein! if you were&#xD;
but a man you should give your life to art and to me, but it is&#xD;
sweeter I suppose to be a woman and give it to Otho. I hope&#xD;
he knows its value."-&#xD;
Many themes did the master and pupil discuss, and the girls&#xD;
wondered how she could drone off so much time up there, and'&#xD;
still have perfect recitations, and scholarly themes. They had&#xD;
quaint jokes, sometimes in Latin, sometimes in Portuguese, and&#xD;
sometimes in the gutteral utterances of the Father-land. The&#xD;
Professor had lived in Brazil and painted the flowers and birds&#xD;
and butterflies, and was teaching Chris the language.&#xD;
It was a happiness, perhaps, which was not altogether good for&#xD;
our Chris. *A life of books, music, art, bearing her away from&#xD;
&#xD;
the practical, the real and common place, making her impatient&#xD;
of, the prattle and froth she got, whenever she did 'chance to be&#xD;
near the knots of girls who discussed the fashions, the beaux, the&#xD;
partiys and fetes they were to have in "society," and who nudged&#xD;
each other, and whispered "queer' specimen," " odd creature,"&#xD;
" such a guy," etc., whenever she appeared.&#xD;
As the Professor's fingers were seldom free from inkstains, (he&#xD;
made numberless copies of violin music for his pupils,,and wrote&#xD;
whole scores for his Beethoven chorus class,) he found no fault with&#xD;
the often sprinkled robes of his favorite. As he had a habit of&#xD;
rumpling and tossing his gray locks, while he studied, he saw no&#xD;
cause for reproof in her knotted curls; even the old blanket shawl&#xD;
which covered such 'a multitude of sins was a fair fellow to his&#xD;
studio gown. One thing is certain, through all her- untidiness&#xD;
and sinful carelessness, Chris grew lovely' with every day. Her&#xD;
face seemed to unlock, and her soul looked out at her eyes. A&#xD;
charming light irradiated her features, fed from within; her fig-&#xD;
ure rounded, and her step sprang lightly, her-head poised grace-&#xD;
fully, her- color deepened and cleared, simply because her life&#xD;
suited her, and her longings were fed from exhaustless supplies.&#xD;
All she had ever imagined of school life came far short' of the&#xD;
ecstatic reality. Chandy sometimes fixed her attention and brought&#xD;
her up with a round turn, by a cutting joke on her buttons or&#xD;
finger-nails, and while the slight impression lasted, she gave duti-&#xD;
ful heed; but he was busy--occupied with his preparations' for&#xD;
departure, and his art school, and his " dear five hundrel." 'So&#xD;
it was that Chris, whom no mother-love had tended and fostered&#xD;
and yet who had so pure 'a heart, so glorious an intellect, and such&#xD;
rare cultivation, was. so absolutely, lamentably wanting, where&#xD;
other women delight to shine, and was left, poor child, to work&#xD;
out her life through many trials.&#xD;

CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHTH.&#xD;
BELLE'S LITTLE GAME.&#xD;
It was five o'clock,, the air clear and stinging cold without,&#xD;
and the evening lamps not yet lighted at Rosenbloon. Belle&#xD;
Brandon stood before the drawing-room window, breathing upon&#xD;
its frosted panes, rubbing them with her handkerchief; and rocks&#xD;
and grottoes and feathery foliage vanished at her touch. . She was&#xD;
trying to see Chandos Goldsmith and Sam, who, wrapped in furs,&#xD;
were about to go sleighing. "A trial trip," as Chandy said of his&#xD;
new mare, Mignone. It was not much of their faces that she&#xD;
could see, for they wore tall Labrador caps, and vast beaver col-&#xD;
lars and gloves. They strutted up and down, puffing at their&#xD;
cigars, chatting and laughing, and Belle got impatient, and tapped&#xD;
her fingers on the'glass, and drew her handsome brows together.&#xD;
Chandy's cigar went out, and he stopped before the window to&#xD;
light it again. She saw the bright flash of the match he drew,&#xD;
and heard the snap of the explosion, and then Sam's exclamation,&#xD;
" Who has been down after brimstone," but had not time to catch&#xD;
Chandy's answer, when the black mare came tearing up to the&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"I hope that odious Chandy won't get his brains dashed out,"&#xD;
said she. Peering out,  she saw them pass the gates of Rosen-&#xD;
bloom, speeding towards the lake, and the jingle of the merry&#xD;
bells grew fainter ; then she floated gracefully out of the drawing-&#xD;
room: five or six of the young Cubans were conversing together&#xD;
around the fire, and the opportunity for an effect was. not to be&#xD;
lost; but once the door fast behind her, she ran swiftly up the&#xD;
(576)&#xD;
&#xD;
stairs, and pushed into Mary Ann Williams' room :"'Come!1"&#xD;
said she, "the way is clear, hurry, before the supper bell brings&#xD;
them all out, like knocking on a hive brings forth the bees."&#xD;
"I won't stir a step unless you promise me faithfully to get the&#xD;
excuse from madame."&#xD;
" I have promised, simpleton, I'll repeat it as many times as&#xD;
you like, only come on, quick."&#xD;
"You. don't always keep your promises," grumbled Mary Ann,&#xD;
" and I know-I never can write a-composition on ' the statics and&#xD;
dynamics of society.' I don't 'even know what the words mean."&#xD;
"I think Professor Noble was amusing himself with you when&#xD;
he gave you that subject, but n'importe you shall have your excuse,&#xD;
and save the fifty credits on your report for the Deacon, if you&#xD;
come directly; if you don't, I'll go alone, and leave you to fight&#xD;
your dynamics as you can."  She seized her by the arm, and as&#xD;
Mary Ann early learned to submit to physical force, she readily&#xD;
obeyed, and the two ran up the broad flight of 'steps, through the&#xD;
'gymnasium, and down the art-students hall till they reached the&#xD;
second corridor, north wing. They stopped at Chandy's door. It&#xD;
is not necessary to tell how Belle knew her way, here where- no&#xD;
ladies came. She took hold of the right door knob at any rate,&#xD;
and paused an' instant to listen. All was still and the corridor&#xD;
unlighted.&#xD;
" Quick now," whispered Belle, " on the center-table, open the&#xD;
portfolio in the first folding. I saw it this morning, but Roger&#xD;
came along and I had to run for my life. Here is a match, there's&#xD;
a drop-light on the table."  She pushed Mary.Ann through the&#xD;
door and watched breathlessly. She counted the seconds which&#xD;
she spent in fumbling among the papers after the flame flashed&#xD;
up.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh dear, what shall I do !" whispered 'the girl, "I've upset&#xD;
the ink bottle."&#xD;
" Have you the sketch ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I've got that safe, but the ink is running."&#xD;
"Stop it with your handkerchief."&#xD;
"I can't, oh dear. It' will spoil the carpet."&#xD;
&#xD;
as&#xD;

" What if it does, come along, never mind the carpet."&#xD;
Belle felt as the old magician did while she waited at the door&#xD;
of the cave, to get the lamp, and Aladdin 'would'nt budge.&#xD;
"I won't come till I've set this up. It 'll be found out some-&#xD;
how I know. Oh dear, do come here and help me.",&#xD;
Belle heard a. door above her shut hastily, but having once or&#xD;
twice before run against this idiosyncrasy in her foil, she knew,&#xD;
her bearings, and glancing hurriedly both ways, and seeing nothing,&#xD;
she rushed in and seized a handkerchief which Tlay on the table&#xD;
and sopped up the dripping blackness, and twitching the paper&#xD;
out of Mary Ann's hand, and pushing the soiled handkerchief&#xD;
into it, she said-"&#xD;
" Take that to your room and burn it up, and shut the door&#xD;
after you," and off she darted, leaving her foil in the dark. She&#xD;
heard voices on the stairs talking in Spanish-flying swiftly on,&#xD;
she 'reached the gymnasium door, it was locked-either the spring&#xD;
bolt had shot in, or' Roger in his rounds had fastened it behind&#xD;
him. There was nothing for it but to go down to the second floor&#xD;
and out through the great school-room. She ran down and met&#xD;
Mary Ann going up. - She was sobbing, half scared, out of her&#xD;
wits, and she seized fast hold of Belle's skirts.' .&#xD;
" You shan't run away ! you know I'm afraid of the dark, let&#xD;
alone being over here, where I've no business, and don't know the&#xD;
way.&#xD;
"Come along, don't be a -fool. That door is fast, we must go&#xD;
by the school-room ;" and. dragging her, she hurried on. The&#xD;
corridor was empty, but some boys were at ball in the play-room&#xD;
opposite the school-room, and the door was ajar. Turning the&#xD;
knob softly, Belle whisked safely through. But just as Mary&#xD;
Ann was passing the threshold,- a boy came chasing his ball out&#xD;
into the corridor.&#xD;
" Hillo ! here's a petticoat ! on our side of the house, come on&#xD;
boys, let's see who is out of bounds."&#xD;
The whole party came pushing and scrambling on, and Miss&#xD;
Belle felt how narrow a chance she ran of exposure and' disgrace.&#xD;
The penalties for her' offence were heavy, and she fled as if fiends&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.'&#xD;
&#xD;
579&#xD;
&#xD;
were chasing her-upsetting a stool and desk, and stumbling&#xD;
over the water jar, 'splashing her stockings-but she did not 'go&#xD;
down, and made good her flight with a bruise or twQ, and Mary&#xD;
Ann left a bit of her dress in the door, which closed after her.&#xD;
They sank down breathless, as soon as they were safe in, her&#xD;
apartment.&#xD;
",There said Belle," holding her side and panting, "put that&#xD;
rag into the fire, the first thing you do," but unfortunately the fire&#xD;
was out, " put it in your coal hod. It will do as well, poke it&#xD;
down among the coals, and ring for Roger directly. There is no&#xD;
place in the room safe from old Filer, and the sooner you 'get it&#xD;
out of the way the better, and be sure you deny everything if any&#xD;
questions are asked. It is not likely there will be 'any. Those&#xD;
boys did not find us out, and everybody is busy. Don't look like&#xD;
all the woes."&#xD;
"But suppose somebody finds my skirt," holding it up dolefully,&#xD;
"what a row there'll be."&#xD;
" Nonsense I There are fifty just such grey dresses in the&#xD;
building, and it is'nt likely they'll go around with the bib to fit it&#xD;
in, as they took Cinderella's slipper. Sit down-at once' and put&#xD;
in a fresh piece.. There is no reason why you should' be suspect-&#xD;
ed. I'm quite sure we're not seen. Remember, not a word, or&#xD;
you will be sorry."&#xD;
Belle hurried away, and Mary Ann took her piece bag from&#xD;
her closet and sat down to follow her directions. She found she&#xD;
could sew a piece quite across the breadth, and make it good&#xD;
as new, and she had her scissors in her hand preparatory to the,&#xD;
first snip,-when Miss Filer walked in holding the lost tatter be.&#xD;
tween her thumb and finger. Seeing Mary Ann's occupation; she&#xD;
took the gown into her hands without a word, and fitted the edges&#xD;
together.&#xD;
"I need not ask who has been out of bounds this evening, but I&#xD;
must insist upon knowing why you were in the gentlemen's cor-&#xD;
ridor.&#xD;
" I was not. I went to the school-room for a book and I got&#xD;

&#xD;
frightened atf a;noise I heard, and caught my dress, and was just&#xD;
going to mend it."&#xD;
"You look frightened," said, Miss Filer, eyeing her sharply ;&#xD;
where's the book youwent for? let.me see it. You know it is&#xD;
forbidden to enter.the school-room after hours without permission."&#xD;
" I-I-did not .fetch my book," stammered Mary Ann, white&#xD;
as chalk. "I could'nt help it-.I ain't to blame, I-"  A knock&#xD;
aththe door, and in good time too, for Mary Ann was beginning&#xD;
to snivel, and in a fit way to let- out every thing.&#xD;
"May I come in, Miss, Filer?  I've finished my lessons, and I&#xD;
know this dear child is behind, it is her normal condition. You&#xD;
know help never comes amiss to her.".&#xD;
While Belle was still waiting permission, Roger came up with&#xD;
his kindlers and brush to make the fire, and after she got ink on&#xD;
account of her kind heart and helpful impulses ; Miss Filer&#xD;
began to cross-question the foil, who got twisted up; tighter in&#xD;
her contradictions every instant, and cast imploring glances at the&#xD;
Blonde.&#xD;
"Here be a rag,;mum I" (Roger held up the ink-stained hand-&#xD;
kerchief.)  "'Twill make-a smell ef you burns it."&#xD;
" This is -a:handkerchief," said Miss Filer, spreading it out&#xD;
gingerly  " What does this mean ?"&#xD;
" I spilled my ink," faltered Mary Ann, under the steely lustre&#xD;
of.Belle.Brandon's eyes, " and I. wiped it up with that."  -&#xD;
On: the only white corner there was a. monogram of dainty&#xD;
lilies and forget-me-nots. Miss Filer screwed her gimlet eyes&#xD;
into it, turning, it about, up and down, trying to make it out.&#xD;
"Ch-and this is surely an s.. Whose is this, MissWilliams ?"&#xD;
MNaryAnn's-teeth ehattered; before she could frame an answer,&#xD;
Belle spoke. She saw that it would not do to keep silence longer.&#xD;
"Let me take it, please," holding out her hand. "I'm a fa-&#xD;
mous:decipherer :of enigmas.. Chandos Goldsmith, ma'am, oft&#xD;
course, nothing could; beplainer."&#xD;
"And how came .a young gentleman's handkerchief in your&#xD;
coal hed?" sad Filer, turningsabout on l~hry AnP-&#xD;
" I'll answer that Miss Filer," said Belle, laughing. "The&#xD;
-ahem, is not so black as he is paintedin this case at anyrate. I&#xD;
&#xD;
spilled my ink, and wiped it up with this unfortunate mouchoir.&#xD;
I found it in the drawing-room this evening where I suppose that&#xD;
remarkably careless young person named Chandos dropped it, but&#xD;
I thought it was mine when I used it, or to speak literally, I seized&#xD;
the first thing I saw, without thinking much about ownerships."&#xD;
" But Miss Williams has just told me she spilled her :ink and&#xD;
wiped it with this. There appears to be a discrepancy."&#xD;
" Yes, dear child--I heard her." She ran to her foil and kissed&#xD;
her gushingly. 'Jfeep your mouth shut," she whispered, with&#xD;
the kiss; and went on aloud. "You must'nt fib even to bring&#xD;
your friend out of trouble. I thank you, but don't do it. No&#xD;
Miss Filer, I spilled the ipk, and I gave this thing to her to wash.&#xD;
She is accustomed to do that sort of work and I am.not. Don't&#xD;
blame the poor child."&#xD;
" But this is not all, Miss Brandon. Somebody has been in&#xD;
the, gentlemen's corridor, and this bit of stuff was found there,&#xD;
which I am sorry to say exactly fits here," holding upMary Ann's&#xD;
skirt.&#xD;
Belle threw a Geraldine glance at the thin teacher, but she&#xD;
laughed merrily.&#xD;
"You'll have to confess, Millithyj she only peeped out at the&#xD;
door, Miss Filer, to see what those stupid boys were at, and drew&#xD;
her head in directly, and the treacherous dopr had; to spring to on&#xD;
her dress, and those boys had just a glimpse. Don't punish&#xD;
her, because after all she did not break bounds ; I was telling her&#xD;
she'd better speak to you when she came up, but the poor child is&#xD;
so much in awe of you."&#xD;
Miss Filer was not by any means clear in her mind as to the&#xD;
discrepancies, but Belle carried it off so gaily, that she ended&#xD;
with reading Mary Ann a lecture upon truthfulness, and ordering&#xD;
her to remain in her room and commit the story of Ananias and&#xD;
Sapphira, instead of going to her supper, and forbiddin  her to&#xD;
speak to any one; and then she held the, door open for Belle to&#xD;
pass out, who instead, linked her arm into the thin one at'her&#xD;
side, and -waled the teacher off in triumph, 4ay"ing  oid~e,&#xD;
dear," to the poor prisoner as she shut her in.&#xD;

CHAPTER THIRTY-NINTH.&#xD;
THE SCHOOL ROOM.&#xD;
To-MORROW    would be the great examination day, when the&#xD;
prizes wereto be awarded, and the ar't scholarship conferred.&#xD;
The class-bell had rung, and still Belle Brandon lingered 'in her&#xD;
room, with her door locked and bolted, working at a drawing.&#xD;
She was not to compete for the prize in crayon sketching, and yet&#xD;
with much on her hands, and few moments to spare, she worked&#xD;
earnestly. After some delicate touches, she held it up in triumph,&#xD;
a wicked smile on her red lips, and a cruel light glittering in her&#xD;
steely eyes.&#xD;
WI think that will do," said she, "a most faithful copy in style&#xD;
and execution. It would have been much quicker done if that&#xD;
odious fellow had not a habit of dotting his work, so that it looks.&#xD;
as if he used a stipple instead of a crayon, though I must give&#xD;
him the credit of finishing as clear and fine as a copper-plate.&#xD;
Who says I am not 'a artist ?' only give me. a subject worthyof&#xD;
my pencil. A little more general frowziness might be effective,&#xD;
and yet I don't see well how I could have gotten any more in."&#xD;
She turned the card-board over and lifted the tissue-paper from&#xD;
the drawing it protected, and studied it.&#xD;
"I'm as sure as I want to be that there's something connected&#xD;
with the petrified silence that girl dotes on, which will give my&#xD;
work keenest sting; I've noticed some covert allusions to. a Swiss&#xD;
journey, and Alpine costumes, and all that, among the three, and&#xD;
I feel sure - this picture bears on it. I don't think I ever so&#xD;
(582)&#xD;
&#xD;
thoroughly detested three humans in my life ; upon my word, I&#xD;
hate them so utterly that it is a luxury."&#xD;
She laid down the card-board and opened the door.&#xD;
" Mary Ann," called she, softly, "come here directly."&#xD;
As she got no reply, she came out and went across the corridor&#xD;
and put her head into thefoil's room.&#xD;
"Sniveling again! upon my word you are getting to be quite a&#xD;
household iNiobe; but you may leave off now,-for a while at&#xD;
least, for I want you."&#xD;
" What do you want ?" asked Mary Ann, blowing her red nose.&#xD;
"I'm going down to class now.")&#xD;
"Not yet, dear ; I have use for your fingers, and don't loiter,&#xD;
either, because I am going to class likewise. Make haste!"&#xD;
Mary Ann rose unwillingly and obeyed.&#xD;
"What is it now? I shall not sew any for you to-day; I've&#xD;
enough to do for myself to get my dress ready. I sat up till&#xD;
midnight last night over your petticoat."&#xD;
"Quite right, my dear ; I am satisfied. What I want now is&#xD;
a little of your marvelous chirography. There is your model, k&#xD;
must be exactly the same, line for line, point for point."&#xD;
"I wish you wouldn't make me write that, Belle; I hate to&#xD;
touch it. She never hurt me, why should I go to plague her ?&#xD;
She did my algebra for me yesterday,, when I know she wanted&#xD;
to be in the Art rooms, for I- stopped her on. the , stairs; but she&#xD;
sat down on the steps and worked it out, without a word."&#xD;
" Greater fool she, to trouble herself about you. Youcan't&#xD;
ever learn algebra, if you study a hundred years. Now sit down&#xD;
and do your task quickly ; you can write; I never saw , sim-&#xD;
pleton in my life who could not beat us clever ones at that."&#xD;
" But I think it is wicked to do this ;; I'd much -rather not."&#xD;
" Wicked ! well I like that, after your exploits at the fair; why&#xD;
half the mischief that spread from that post-office came off&#xD;
your pen."&#xD;
" Well if it did, it lid not come out of my brains."&#xD;
"Your brains'! bless me, what an idea, (tapping Mary. Ann's&#xD;
head rather hard with her knuckles,) empty, my dear ; hollow'as&#xD;
a gourd-shell."&#xD;

"'Leave my head, alone!" -said the victim, angrily, twitching&#xD;
away. " I'm-just as the Lord made me, anyway ; Ihaven't made&#xD;
a devil of my-self."&#xD;
"Do you mean to say that I have? You flatter me too much;&#xD;
but come," added Belle, who feared that she might aggravate her&#xD;
foil too far; "come, it won't takeyou a minute ; it is only a joke,&#xD;
just a bit of my fun, nothing more, I assure you."&#xD;
" So you said then. ' If I had known what' use you : would&#xD;
intake of those hateful letters, and all the grief and misery that&#xD;
would come of them, I'd-have let you do anything to me before&#xD;
I'd have touched them; I wish I dare tell it now."&#xD;
"iNonsense! You had your mother's example ; didn't she in-&#xD;
dite a wondrous epistle to Mr. Growing ? You'd better banish all&#xD;
such thoughts from your head, because you'd find yourself in no&#xD;
end of-a mess. Besides, what I said was true ; those letters were&#xD;
for my amusement; they answered their, end, and if the fools&#xD;
would make earnest of a good joke, neither you nor I were to&#xD;
blame. But that is all done finished now ; go on, please."&#xD;
She placed the pen in- her victim's fingers, and did ndt leave&#xD;
her till she had accomplished her end. Then examining carefully&#xD;
the completed work, she locked it in her writing-desk.&#xD;
"Go, now; poor tender conscience ! I've done, with you."&#xD;
After a last look at her face in -the mirror, and finishing&#xD;
touches of} her hair and apparel, without which she never left her&#xD;
apartment, (she knew the power 'of her beauty, it was her stock&#xD;
in trade,) Belle went slowly down stairs in an exalted franie of&#xD;
mind, to judge by her satisfied face, and the exultant " Gloria"&#xD;
she hummed in tones which, though suppressed to a murniur, were&#xD;
so clear and .joyous as showed the absolute control she possessed&#xD;
over her wonderful voice. As shereached madame's parlor,'that&#xD;
dignitary looked out.&#xD;
"Ah, Miss Brandon, I was looking for a messenger, and behold&#xD;
a Ilebe ! Do me the favor to step up to my dressing-room and&#xD;
fetch the case of Fabers onrthe desk."&#xD;
"Avec gradplaisir, madame:" Belle smiled sweetly; she was&#xD;
a favorite with madame ; showy scholars= always are with teah-&#xD;
&#xD;
ers who are fond of making what Chandy called "a splurIge,"&#xD;
with their pupils.  Belle told on the committee, middle-aged men&#xD;
they were, too, who ought to have much wisdom-eren of mark,&#xD;
and substance.&#xD;
The pencils were i'eadily found, but Hebe lingered, for a letter&#xD;
lay on the desk, whose clean, pointed chirography she knew per-&#xD;
fectly.  She always made it a point to read open letters, and she&#xD;
had already perused many in the 'same hand, and' addressed to&#xD;
Miss Goldsmith, having a monogram in the corner, a head of&#xD;
Sappho, and the letters 0. G. bound about with a wreathHof pan-&#xD;
sies. This sheet was plain. Belle tossed her curls and smiled,&#xD;
when she had secured the contents.&#xD;
DEAR MOTHER:&#xD;
-I shall be at home in twenty-four hours after you receive this. Dou't let&#xD;
my little Chris know it, though, for I.would not miss thewild-deer look in&#xD;
her glorious brown eyes at sight of me, for a hat-full of gold. You see I&#xD;
was right, my mother ; love for me was all that was needed. Not a little flaw&#xD;
now, not a spot on the perfection of her loveliness; I stayed' with your long&#xD;
entiogh to see that, and I saw that you respected my darling's talents. IEkiiow&#xD;
you have learned to love her; I :please myself in my lonely office over the&#xD;
picture she is,.sitting by you,,holding your hand, and, II rejoice that Iecan&#xD;
give you such a daughter.&#xD;
My old friend Max will come with me, only just landed, and looking as&#xD;
German as can be. You.will give him a warm welcome for my sake, (you&#xD;
are such a precious mother,) but don't tell your young ladies he is a Count,&#xD;
they are sure -enough 'to go wild over. him anyhow.. :Dear mother, good-&#xD;
night. I shall kiss you to-morrow.&#xD;
" Model son. and ardent lover! a most proper person," sneered&#xD;
Belle, as she folded the sheet and replaced it, precisely, to a hair's&#xD;
breadth, (she was an adept in these little exploits,-ad usether&#xD;
eyes,) and ran down stairs.&#xD;
"Not an hour too soon;" -she thought.  " Iwas afraid myiMary&#xD;

-palsy; and this letter is a perfect god-send; I'll keep my eye on&#xD;
her. Supercilious Mr. -Otho can suffer, I suppose, as well as&#xD;
meaner miortals, and all Miss Goldsmith's learning won't save her&#xD;
from tearing her hair with shame and mortification ; and dear&#xD;
Chandy I hope will relish my improvement on his work. *I de-&#xD;
sire to be modest, but really ,I am satisfied with its merits."&#xD;
She had got seated in class before she had finished her medita-&#xD;
tions, and she was late; but he gave madame's errand as her ex-&#xD;
cuse,, and so secured her ten, and after finding the page of "Mar-&#xD;
mion," on which they were drilling, she paid little heed to the&#xD;
exercise, till a burst of irrepressible laughter recalled her. Not&#xD;
only the class were convulsed, but all the scholars, who should&#xD;
have been busy with their lessons, were joining in the merriment.&#xD;
" Once more," said Miss" Filer, wiping her face, red with the&#xD;
use of. the'rusty muscles so seldom called into exercise.&#xD;
Mary, Ann rose. Belle looked at her ; she was uneasy about&#xD;
her at times ; policy suggested a little petting once in a while,&#xD;
but overbearing=had thus far got the best of it.  She noted the&#xD;
dreary expression of her chalky face, but her sing-song voice and&#xD;
manner were as usual.;&#xD;
" On tho Earl's cheek the flesh off rag,&#xD;
O'ercame the ashen hug off-ag,&#xD;
Thus he broke forth: 'And dast theow then&#xD;
To baard the douge-lass in his den,&#xD;
The lion in his hole                  -&#xD;
And hoppest thow hence unscratched to go,&#xD;
No by St. Breed of Bothwell, no.'"&#xD;
The rather uncivil;remarks of the old Highlander, and his em-&#xD;
phatic peroration, were entirely -lost in the burst of applause&#xD;
which greeted the fair reader, who sat 'down and mumbled her&#xD;
lips, quite crest-fallen,&#xD;
Filer's nose fairly kindled with her mirth, and she was fain to&#xD;
dismiss her class and retire to bathe that organ, for fear of spon-&#xD;
taneous combustion.,&#xD;
&#xD;
. "I did not think you could do it twice, my dear, but you did,&#xD;
without the least variation," said she to Mary Ann. " I congrat-&#xD;
ulate you."&#xD;
Though so hard pressed by their teachers, the pupils still found&#xD;
time for their usual jokes and fun. As for Chandy, nobody could&#xD;
press him hard, and le1 sat in the philosophy class, leaning on&#xD;
Sam's-shoulder, in his usual lazy fashion, but making perfect rec-&#xD;
itations, whenever Prof. Noble called upon him.- Though he rose&#xD;
to his feet each time as if the effort was tremendous,"he generally&#xD;
called up smiles upon his teacher's face by his odd conceits and&#xD;
whimsical deductions, as original as they were queer.&#xD;
"Now scholars," said the Professor, "let me have your opinion.&#xD;
Suppose a bell could be electrically rung in a deserted city, where&#xD;
there was no living thing, would there be any sound?  What do&#xD;
you think, Miss Christabel ?"&#xD;
"I think there could be none, sir," said Chris, smiling. "'He&#xD;
that hath ears to hear let him hear,' and if there were no ears&#xD;
there could be no sound; the waves would flow on and expand,&#xD;
but since sound is the effect upon the ear," &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
Chris's reply brought on one of those discussions which Prof.&#xD;
Noble permitted as a means of finding out what his pupils were&#xD;
made of, and while it was in progress, Zoe saw a little- three-&#xD;
cornered note alight in her lap.  She opened it and read:&#xD;
" When I am out sleighing to-night with my Mignone in the shafts, and&#xD;
one of you by my side, and the moon shines on us, and the merry bells jin-&#xD;
gle, as over the snow swiftly we go, how dismal will the other one look,&#xD;
toasting her feet in old Filer's society."&#xD;
Zoe and Sabrina laughed, and glanced across at Chandy, who,&#xD;
entirely oblivious of their presence, seemed tremendously absorbed&#xD;
in Prof. Noble's remarks.&#xD;
Presently another twisted missive fell softly upon Sabrina's&#xD;
open book, marking the topic, " Circulinear Motion."  This time&#xD;
it was:&#xD;
"When'I am married to one of you, I'll tell my children how you two&#xD;
used to neglect your lessons, and make no end of blunders, which caused our&#xD;

&#xD;
blood run cold; because you were writing notes to me in class; and the other&#xD;
will be a fearful old maid with a tabby-cat or a mission."&#xD;
They Ihanded the two to Bertha, who sat next, and in their own&#xD;
amusement they failed to notice the dreary smile on her face.&#xD;
Just then ProTNoble was called away for visitors, and summoned&#xD;
Filer to his place.&#xD;
" What is the topic under consideration ?" said she, settling&#xD;
herself with a brisk rustle, as a bantam hen shakes out her feath-&#xD;
ers, and laying down her class-book, all ready-for failures.&#xD;
"Tides, ma'am," said Zoe.&#xD;
"And the moral of that is," put in Chandy, borrowing from&#xD;
Alice's Duchess, " that 'filers and tides wait for no man.' "&#xD;
"Apropos to tides," said Filer, coolly ignoring Chandy and his&#xD;
remark, "can any one tell me why the waters of the Gulf Stream&#xD;
are always warn ?"&#xD;
"I should think it might be the terribly hot weather," suggest-&#xD;
ed Chandy.     .&#xD;
"No doubt the atmosphere influences the temperature," replied&#xD;
Filer; taking Chandy's reply au serieux, " but the chief cause is&#xD;
motion. There is no motion without producing heat... The Gulf&#xD;
Stream flows very rapidly, and it is the friction against the banks&#xD;
which evolves the heat, and raises the temperature of the water."&#xD;
The class regarded each other in astonishment, and then looked&#xD;
at Filer ; and Chandy took out a pencil and said, bowing duti-&#xD;
fully-"&#xD;
"Allow me to make a note of that, Miss Filer. Wonderful,&#xD;
isn't it?" proceeded to write down the remarkable fact.&#xD;
Zoe fabricated a fool's-cap- from her handkerchief, with long-&#xD;
pointed ears, and held it up to Master Chandy's gaze, who felt&#xD;
his own auricles and made a wry face, and spread his hands with&#xD;
a deprecatory gesture._&#xD;
"And -stick musk roses in thy sleek, smooth head," said Zoe,&#xD;
half aloud, whisking the ears softly.&#xD;
"Communicating again, Miss Walsingham?" called out Filer,&#xD;
delighted to have an opportunity of 'pouncing upon Zoe, who was&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAJGHTER.             89&#xD;
unpleasant to her, not only because of her blooming youth, but&#xD;
because she was " always in a giggle," as she declared.&#xD;
" Yes ma'am," said Zoe, " a little."&#xD;
" Third offence ! Take your books, &amp;amp;c., and go to the north&#xD;
recitation room, and remain till sent for."&#xD;
" Zoe picked up her books without any remonstrance, which,&#xD;
indeed, would have been wasted'breath, and made great show of&#xD;
searching for something, peering under. the desks, moving'the&#xD;
chairs, and lifting all the books, which Filer bore as long as she&#xD;
could in her aggravated state.&#xD;
" What are yousearching for?" asked she at length, in a shrill&#xD;
voice.&#xD;
" The and so forth, ma'am," replied Zoe modestly.&#xD;
All the class laughed, and Filer looked furious. "You may&#xD;
commit fifty lines of Cowper's Task this evening in recreation&#xD;
hour," said she.&#xD;
"Wo4't it be a hard task for me to make Cowper's Task my&#xD;
task, Miss Filer ?"&#xD;
" You may commit sixty lines, Miss Walsingham; ten more for&#xD;
impertinence."&#xD;
Zoe courtesied meekly, and walked toward the door, threw it&#xD;
open, and as the last. fold of her scarlet dress was disappearing,&#xD;
she turned about and stood framed in the dark oak like a Gypsy&#xD;
picture.&#xD;
"Miss Filer," said she in a beseeching tone, which that gimlet-&#xD;
eyed lady ought to have suspected, "may I speak to you before&#xD;
Igo?"&#xD;
" Speak ! " said Filer.&#xD;
"Thanks, ma'am; you are very kind. I'm going to forgive&#xD;
you now, because I know I shan't get out' before sundown, and I&#xD;
am instructed not to let that hmuinary go down on my wrath, it&#xD;
would be wicked. I forgive you freely, Miss Filer."  She kissed&#xD;
her hand and vanished, and poor Filer rubbed her nose and con-&#xD;
sidered whether it would be wise to call her back; and Chlndy&#xD;
struck his thumb nails together in infinitesinal applause, which&#xD;
shie thought best not to see.&#xD;

"Hand up your abstra&amp;amp;s,: class. Mr. Goldsmith, I'll take&#xD;
yours first."&#xD;
Chandy rose lazily. " Sorry to have to offer it in pencil, Miss&#xD;
Filer; but I came in late from driving last night, and some fiend&#xD;
or fairy had overset my ink bottle in my absence, and I was re-&#xD;
duced to, plubago-better than lumbago, but not nice." He&#xD;
happened to look at Mary Ann Williams, and thought what an&#xD;
ugly brick color she could be sometimes. Belle glanced at her&#xD;
and then at Miss Filer, who pricked up her ears at the mention&#xD;
of ink, and privately made up her mind to follow the clue and&#xD;
ferret out the whole.&#xD;
After school, Belle Brandon came purring about Chris with all&#xD;
her claws in velvet. She found her deep in Virgil.&#xD;
"Chris, Mignone, (she had taken to calling her Mignone since&#xD;
she learned that it was the name of Chandy's mare,) don't you&#xD;
think we had better take a good practice at our duet?  The try.&#xD;
ing hour approaches, and our Holy Mother's footsteps don't move&#xD;
just in time."&#xD;
Chris paused, and looked absently up, with her forefinger on&#xD;
the open page of her Lexicon, down whose columns she was&#xD;
eagerly chasing a hidden verb. " I'm busy now," she replied&#xD;
shortly.&#xD;
"N'importe. I won't interrupt you then ; but as I've done my&#xD;
lessons I'm going ,to be a good Christian, and lay over your,&#xD;
bureau before dreary Filer pounces on you. Shall I, Mignone ?"&#xD;
"Do anything you like, so you don't bother ene," said Chris,&#xD;
drawing her brows together ; "though I'd like to have my room&#xD;
to myself, I know'its of no use to say so, unless I get up and&#xD;
put you out."&#xD;
" They say I am a wilful little puss," laughed Belle ; and hum-&#xD;
ming ",Call me pet names," she opened the top drawer. It was&#xD;
inits most chaotic state, for Chris had stirred it up before dinner&#xD;
in the vain hope to discover a. box of pens which had cut loose&#xD;
from her writing desk and withdrawn to parts unknown ; and&#xD;
Belle took out all the articles and folded and. replaced them..&#xD;
&#xD;
When it was 'all complete, she still .was not satisfied with her&#xD;
labor of love, and proceeded to the next. In the corner she&#xD;
found the box of cinnamon wood, in which lay perdue the old&#xD;
lace Deborah had caressed on her hard hand before bestowing it.&#xD;
"Eh biern," murmured the benevolent worker, "Je presque fni;"&#xD;
and huddling back the articles, her labor of love was finished.&#xD;
" Chris, dear,: may I take this?"&#xD;
Chris turned an angry, perplexed face toward her. " Take&#xD;
anything ! only leave me to myself.",&#xD;
" Thank you,",purred Belle, and gliding out of the door, she&#xD;
muttered, " bookish idiot ! what should keep me when I've found&#xD;
what I want." In the passage she met Mary Ann, who shrank&#xD;
away from her and would have gone past without speaking, though&#xD;
she watched Belle's beautiful face as if she had sold her soul to her.&#xD;
" Come to my room to-morrow early," said the blonde care-&#xD;
lessly ; "I have a plan, and shall need your help."&#xD;
"I wish you would leave me out of your plans; my life -is a&#xD;
torment to me. I mean to write to father and ask to go :home."'&#xD;
" Don't take the trouble, dear, because. if you do, I shall feel it&#xD;
my duty to indite an epistle to your lady mother, lauding your&#xD;
rapid development and the absolute necessity there is for you to&#xD;
remain, and speak of sweet Mr. Brown and his love for you."&#xD;
As she finished her sentence, she was astonished, to see Mary&#xD;
Ann's chalky face kindle into a deep blush, and her eyes fill with&#xD;
tears; and she thought, is it possible that this girl is capable of&#xD;
love !&#xD;
"Did Cymbalinus Adolphus confess his passion, dear?  Does&#xD;
he know how fondly you adore him ?"&#xD;
"Let me go, Belle," exclaimed Mary Ann, pushing past.-&#xD;
" You know very well he don't care nothing about me." She&#xD;
burst into tears, and went sobbing away.&#xD;
Belle looked after her an instant, and floated smiling on. As&#xD;
she entered the school-room, she heard little Joe Dimmock call&#xD;
out to the half-a-dozen scholars left in the great school-room-&#xD;
" Look a-here, fellows !" pointing to  the fresh bunch of moss&#xD;
rose, buds, backed by its one geranium  leaf, which exquisite&#xD;

Chandysported at' his button-hole, "look a-here.! Somebody's&#xD;
green-house has blown over, and old Goldsmith has been helping&#xD;
himself to the spoils."&#xD;
Chandy threw a quick glance at Dolores Zambrano, who pout.&#xD;
ed her full lips and petulantly flirted the fan, without which. she&#xD;
never felt at ease: and he stopped the irrepressible little Wag in his&#xD;
outpouring of laughter and impudence ; seizing him'by the rcoat-&#xD;
ollar¢and holding him out of the window, while-Sam Slaughton&#xD;
shied at his defenceless curls many snowballs. The youngster&#xD;
resigned himself to his fate, dodged the missiles at his best, and&#xD;
amused his leisure between the shots with throwing kisses to a&#xD;
. couple of'girls who were passing in jackets and red riding-hoods&#xD;
on their way to the billiard-room, and who stopped to laugh at&#xD;
him.-&#xD;
"Were they your flowers, Dolores?" asked Belle.&#xD;
The Spanish girl came up and put her arms around her friend's&#xD;
waist s soon as she saw ,her.&#xD;
"Yes. Is he not wicked ? the cruel little wretch !  Have&#xD;
you the permission to go with us-yet ?"&#xD;
"Not yet, dear," replied Belle, lifting the golden crucifix which&#xD;
Dolores wore at the end of her jet rosary,-and kissing it, an act&#xD;
which ,always delighted the ardent Catholic, who hoped to get a&#xD;
con vert, and implored the Virgin to that end daily, and said no&#xD;
end of "Paters and Gracias" in her behalf. The truth was,&#xD;
Belle-had not decided where it would best suit her interest to be-&#xD;
stow herself after Christmas, and did not intend to commit her-&#xD;
self at present.&#xD;
"I wish he could be- with us, too," whispered -Dolores,pointing&#xD;
to Chaidp. "I shill beg of Henrique to ask him."&#xD;
"Heis going'abroiad, you knoe."&#xD;
"But I do not wish himto to," answered Dolores, Wilfully.&#xD;
" He-tiust stay."   -&#xD;
Belle looked at the flashin  eyes seeking hers, and then over&#xD;
at Chandy,- and thought--but she did not tell - her thought-and&#xD;
- the bell sininohed them all to supper. After that was over, she&#xD;
resented herself againmat Chris' door.  -     :-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Madane's compliments, and our- division are to study:in the&#xD;
-library this evening. I think the old -lady meditates a :lecture.&#xD;
Come, 1lignone, wake up ; the bell is ringing, and you will get a&#xD;
cypher. ' Old Filer is rasping to-day."&#xD;
Without pausing , to think of the very unusual interest Belle&#xD;
was evincing in her welfare, Chris rose hastily, gathered up -her&#xD;
books, drew her old grey shawl around her shoulders,'and ran- *&#xD;
swiftly down the stairs, hating to lose a moment- The apartment&#xD;
was large and handsome. A carpet of green oak leaves, wreath-&#xD;
ed on a'white ground, covered the floor ; book-cases between the&#xD;
four windows, on whose panels were carved .pens, gravers ink-&#xD;
stands, ' &amp;amp;c., curiously grouped. A library table stood in the cen-&#xD;
ter,; comfortable chairs about it, already filled with welldressed,&#xD;
blooming girls ; a cheerful wood fire on the hearth; and in the&#xD;
four corners four little desks, each for a single student. A cosier&#xD;
or more completely adapted room for study could not be wished&#xD;
for. Sabrina moved to make room for Chris at the center table,&#xD;
but she dashed past her and dropped into one of the corner chairs,&#xD;
And opening her books, commenced without a lost moment where&#xD;
she left off, and was immediately oblivious of everything. Some&#xD;
of her pleasantest -evenings with Otho had been passed in this&#xD;
room. -The books they had read together were shut up behind&#xD;
those carved doors. The chess-men : they had used- when he&#xD;
taught her "Knight's pawn, checkmate in four moves," stood in&#xD;
battle array ; -the-- belligerent horsemen, mitered bishops,'and&#xD;
strong castles-all on the curiously inlaid table, bearing Otho'sname&#xD;
in mosaic and gold on the margin. ' Thee wreath of scarlet, maple&#xD;

Den-and he had been so kind about: "Elizabetta," though yhe&#xD;

were concentrated upon Virgil's farm, for she was reading his first&#xD;
Bucolic.; Oh, Chris, dear !-don't you know there are breakers&#xD;
ahead-just before you-and you have shipped your oars and are&#xD;
drifting-right among them!&#xD;
Belle took the opposite chair to Chris, whom she had followed&#xD;
with the same sort of interest which possessed that handsome knit.&#xD;
* ter, who watched her victims to the guillotine. She deemed in no&#xD;
hurry to'.take up her lesson, but occupied herself in scanning the&#xD;
assembled pupils, beautiful girls, many of them, perfectly dressed,&#xD;
all; at aside table sat half a dozen Cubans, Henrique Zambrano&#xD;
among them, who sprang up and bowed on her entrance, and a&#xD;
couple, of New Yorkers, and Sam Slaughton and Chandy, all&#xD;
studying and enjoying themselves. Belle glanced in the mirror&#xD;
at her own toilette, a pale blue empress cloth, with satin trimmings;&#xD;
the .square - pompadour body showing her white throat and&#xD;
swelling bust, scarcely hidden beneath its lace shelter, her blonde&#xD;
curls floating softly over her shoulders. A smile parted her lips,&#xD;
a curious smile, such as the handsome Knitter threw up at the&#xD;
young girls in the cart, as her, eyes.rested upon the figure in the&#xD;
corner, bent over her books, her hair knotted in a frizzled unsight-&#xD;
ly mass, buttons off, trimmings hanging, elbows out, her col-&#xD;
lar slipped under her left ear as though she were about to be hung&#xD;
by it, and the front breadth of her dress, soiled, stained and spot-&#xD;
ted with ink. There was a fatality about the poor child's ink bot-&#xD;
ties. '1, was as if they'were possessed. They were always up-&#xD;
setting and breaking and scattering their contents over their fated&#xD;
owner and all her belongings. The black silk apron she had&#xD;
worn all day to cover the :last deluge, had burst its belt with an&#xD;
unlucky sneeze, slipped' off 'unconscious, and was now lying per-&#xD;
due, behind the door of her apartment.&#xD;
Madame, for r'easons-of her own, had lapsed from her severity&#xD;
into perfect disregard of Chris, and her habits.  Perhaps she&#xD;
considered her case hopeless, and that was not usual with her&#xD;
either, for she was noted for her power over her pupils. 'Belle&#xD;
had bewailed the " darling child, so careless," in her presence often&#xD;
'with swimming eyes, and had been much commended by madame&#xD;
&#xD;
for her efforts to reform the culprit and the excellent tender feel-&#xD;
ing she manifested towards her. She being herself so free from&#xD;
faults, so exact ; for .Belle had, as she prophesied, got madame to&#xD;
" tell the clock to any business she said befitted the hour."  "I am&#xD;
afraid, my dear," she had said at the close of one of those talks, "I&#xD;
am afraid you are right, Miss Goldsmith is incurable, a model&#xD;
scholar, a magnificent intellect, but so-sadly wanting in feminine&#xD;
qualities ;" and she gave her no more, lectures, but she did not&#xD;
know how much of her settled dislike was attributable to Miss&#xD;
Belle's artful suggestions, quick witted comments, and sly holding&#xD;
her up to ridicule.&#xD;

CHAPTER FORTIETH.&#xD;
OTHO TIAS COME.&#xD;
The library door swung open and madame entered apparelled as&#xD;
for a banquet. Throwing a quick comprehensive glance at the&#xD;
assembled pupils, she turned her eyes upon the bronze clock on&#xD;
the mantel, and compared her watch. There was a restless bus-&#xD;
tle in her movements, quite out of keeping with her usual stately&#xD;
dignity. She fussed up to Bertha and pulled her collar and neck-&#xD;
tie, and passed her hand over her smooth braids, then turned to&#xD;
Chris with a glance, half pitiful, half impatient. She was fresh&#xD;
from aperusal of her son's epistle, and she sighed. " Such a&#xD;
spectacle, such a contrast to the others, and such a bitter mortify-&#xD;
ing disappointment," and her eyes rested upon her favorite's lovely&#xD;
head bent over her book, and upon her graceful attitude, harmoni-&#xD;
ous coloring and she sighed again. "She would be an ornament to'&#xD;
any household," and her face hardened. "This must cure him of&#xD;
his mad folly, it must ! it shall. I will not have her for a daughter,&#xD;
and yet she is true and pure, and modest and wise. Is it not&#xD;
cruel,the exposure before all these, how will he bear it ? I am only&#xD;
carrying out his desires ; he requested me to keep his com-&#xD;
ing a secret, but oh, how different to what he expects! Can it&#xD;
be that I am spoiling my boy's life? will he ever love again? he is&#xD;
so steadfast ; suppose he should go away and leave me 'and never&#xD;
return. It is not too late to warn her. I'll send her away now&#xD;
before he comes.' She made a step forward, with her hand ex-&#xD;
tended, thinking to place it upon Chris' shoulder. It was too,&#xD;
late, foi even then, the door opened again, and Otho entered, and&#xD;
(596)   ,&#xD;
&#xD;
walked up to her with his firm proud step, anzi4 took her hand in&#xD;
his loving clasp, put it to his lips, and she heard his dear voice&#xD;
calling her "mother." All in the room were aware of his pres-&#xD;
ence before Chris knew it., When his voice fell on her absorbed&#xD;
ear, she started as if waking from a dream, and a flood of scarlet&#xD;
flamed up in her.cheeks; then ais the other speakers talked on&#xD;
and he spoke no more, she sighed and dropped her face again over&#xD;
her Virgil. Belle went up and touched her.&#xD;
"Look, Miss Goldsmith, who has come."&#xD;
Just at this instant, Otho spoke again. " This is my 'friend&#xD;
Max, my otherr,' and my sister, .Bertha, this is the dear Max&#xD;
you know of," and Chris sprang to her feet, the glad light in her&#xD;
eyes, the radiant joy beaming all over her face.&#xD;
" Poor old Chris," whispered Belle in her ear,. " what a toilette&#xD;
for a lover, and the queen mother is looking, 'off with her head '&#xD;
at you."&#xD;
Chris threw a startled look at Belle and then cast her eyes&#xD;
down her soiled raiment; and the soul fled from ,them,;leaving&#xD;
her face like sculptured marble. When Otho spoke to her. she&#xD;
forced herself to look at him, but her fingers-refused the cold greet-&#xD;
ing which scarcely touched them, and her heart stopped beating&#xD;
beneath his stern displeasure, which would have been disgust but&#xD;
for his knightly. courtesy. He did not present his. friend to her,&#xD;
but linking his arm within his own he passed around the circle&#xD;
and went through the needful speeches with a haughty curl on his&#xD;
lip, and left him among the Cubans, with whom he commenced&#xD;
a conversation in Spanish.&#xD;
"You are translated now, Max, as near heaven as your friends&#xD;
wish you to be, and I shall leave you while I go and get the wel-&#xD;
come my father has for me," He offered his arm to his mother,&#xD;
whose face was troubled and stern, and they walked away with-&#xD;
out another word, without a look at the shrinking girl in the cor-&#xD;
ner, who bent her eyes to the ground, and bowed herself a hope-&#xD;
less culprit. The young ladies clustered together and began in&#xD;
defiance of all rule, to talk. They drew away from Chris, all&#xD;
but Sabrina, who rose to approach her, then changed her mind and&#xD;

&#xD;
got leave to go out of the room. Chrisheardthem whisper, and&#xD;
felt their wondering contemptuous looks. She owned that she de-&#xD;
served it all, but felt her punishment \almost greater than she&#xD;
could bear. The young Cubans signified a desire to withdraw,&#xD;
and did so, taking Max with them, and Chandy and Samjoined&#xD;
them. The study hour was not finished, and Miss Filer's bell&#xD;
summoned the girls to their tasks, and' silence fell again upon&#xD;
them. Chris knew that all was over, and with a dead numbness&#xD;
about her heart, she bent her eyes upon the page, but the words&#xD;
blurred, and ran together, and she sadt only Otho's proud, angry&#xD;
face, and remembered that hehad come and gone, and she was&#xD;
alone. The weary time lapsed slowly, but tlhe last second ticked&#xD;
off at length, and she was at liberty to hide her shame and sorrow,&#xD;
in her own room. She threw down her books and locked her door,&#xD;
and sat down to think. She chose her place before her mirror, and&#xD;
forced her eyes to examine the disheveled figure, the tangled hair,&#xD;
pushed off her forehead in wild confusion, the tatters, the ink-&#xD;
stains: she studied them all, in bitter contempt, and called herself&#xD;
a liar.&#xD;
"You have no regard for your promise, Christabel Goldsmith,"&#xD;
said she, rising and pushing away her chair. "You know how&#xD;
much he desired what he asked you to do for him, and you forgot&#xD;
it as soon as he was out of your sight. You deserve all that is&#xD;
before you; miserable girl, now go to bed, and to sleep if you&#xD;
can.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER. FORTY-FIRST.&#xD;
THE PICTURE.&#xD;
When Chris opened her eyes to the grey light of the morning,&#xD;
a heavy sense of desolation, a pressure of evil sat on her breast.&#xD;
She passed her hands over her throbbing temples,.and wondered if&#xD;
she were ill. Then the flood-gates of memory opened and dashed&#xD;
over her consciousness the. misery of her condition. The look she-&#xD;
had seen in Otho's eyes as he turned his. back upon her made her&#xD;
cover her own in    despair ; (who can bear contempt and an-&#xD;
ger in the face one loves best,) and she buried her head beneath&#xD;
the bed clothes, and wished she might lie there, hidden forever.&#xD;
Her cheeks burned as she listened to the fancied comments upon&#xD;
the scene ; how she had been talked up and pitied and ridiculed,&#xD;
and in startling clearness she saw Belle as she had looked down&#xD;
upon her, and roused her with her exclamation,," Poor old Chris."&#xD;
The gleam of triumph in her eyes, the white little teeth, the&#xD;
creamy flesh, the lovely neck in dress of pompadour cut. She&#xD;
even seemed to feel the light touch upon her shoulder which-always&#xD;
made her chilly, and she began to wonder why she must suffer so.&#xD;
She had hurt nobody-broken no divine law. There she paused,&#xD;
she had acted a lie, every day witnessed against her;'how she&#xD;
had wickedly; foolishly, disregarded her promise, and disgraced&#xD;
her girlhood in tlge eyes of all around her. The necessity for&#xD;
immediate action dawned through her rayless darkness. She had&#xD;
got to face them all. She had got to meet Otho, to-day, to-mor-&#xD;
row, as many days as he should choose to try her with his pres-&#xD;

ence. He would speak to her, and she must frame fitting reply.&#xD;
Madame would look at her, and would rejoice to have her son&#xD;
back again ; and-what after that?  She pushed back all such&#xD;
thought and -sprang up, and bent her soul to get through the&#xD;
present at her best. Since she had neglected herself, and sold&#xD;
her lover for scholarship, that should shine brilliant in all eyes&#xD;
which had witnessed her disgrace. She dreaded the sympathy&#xD;
and kind looks her few friends would be ready to give her, and be-&#xD;
gan to study how she could bear herself so as to repress all such&#xD;
expressions, She had to join her voice with Belle's 4hi a duet, and&#xD;
she clenched her hands and set her teeth at the thought of the&#xD;
gorgeous beauty which would contrast- with the pale - face and&#xD;
hollow eyes set in deep circles'of, purple, which her mirror showed&#xD;
her: -Shedrew her=bowl:full of freezing water andplunged her&#xD;
fae into it, and was glad to feel the blood rush up :into her cheeks,&#xD;
but it=was only for an instant; the= scarlet glow vanished, and the&#xD;
set stbny 'look was there still. She studied her face with a new&#xD;
interest, and turned away after a critical examination with a hope-,&#xD;
less dreary'smhile. -Then, she- opened her armoire and sought&#xD;
among'hei- dresses for a suitable one for the days' trial, and as she&#xD;
cast them aside one by one, the buzzing talk over their toilettes,&#xD;
she had heard at table, in. the halls-everywhere--of ribbons,&#xD;
sashes, gaiters, combs, and such gauds, which had interested her&#xD;
as mnch as the singing of the crickets and no mores came to her,&#xD;
mind, and she wondered why she was not like other girls; and she&#xD;
awakened to the- disordered condition of her wardrobe; torn,&#xD;
frayed,.soiled, untidy everything ! and she remembered that for&#xD;
weeks she had not given a thought to the garments she was toss-&#xD;
ing over, and a blank dread of Filer's "deportment book " passed&#xD;
upon:her, and all the scholars and the assembled guests would hear&#xD;
the standings. Her eye lighted upon the pansy robe, in-which&#xD;
she had been so happy,' and with sudden anger she pounced upon&#xD;
it and, threw it out. It floated softly from her rude:touch and lay'&#xD;
A vapory-cloud upon the floor. There was a black merino, it was,&#xD;
dyed and turned from one of her mother's, and had a sad three&#xD;
cornered rent; a drab one, that was covered with ink; .calicoes,&#xD;
&#xD;

alpacas, ginghams, all spoiled ; even her . Sunday. suit of .bottle&#xD;
green was shabby, worn at the wrists and elbows. Nothing to&#xD;
wear ! she was about to give over in despair, when she fished up&#xD;
Sabrina's grey poplin, wrapped in a.towel and pinned close, lying&#xD;
on the bottom of the armoire. She .examined .it critically. It&#xD;
was a stranger to her eyes, (though the whitebundle had lain&#xD;
there since her first unpacking,). and perfect in every part. She&#xD;
shook it out and dressed herself carefully, and sat down; but she&#xD;
was all the while studying the part she.had to act,-fixing up little&#xD;
speeches for emergencies, and the stony, dreary look never left&#xD;
her face.&#xD;
. knock at the door. She went slowly and opened 'it,and&#xD;
looked full in Belle Brandon's dimpled face.&#xD;
"Come to the music hall and practice, mignone," said she, push-&#xD;
ing her head into the room. A I see you are all dressed;t We've&#xD;
not a momentsto loose. You've been borrowing a, dress of some-&#xD;
body, I do believe., What a pityyou had'nt; worn it last night.&#xD;
Such a guy as you were !" Then she espied the .pansy robe, and&#xD;
tried to squeezefher plumpness past the unpromisinglooking, girl&#xD;
who kept the knob in her fingers. "That lovely, dress !. Will&#xD;
you wear it this evening ?"&#xD;
" This evening !".repeated Chris, " where and why ?"&#xD;
"This evening !" said Belle, mimicking her voice and manner.&#xD;
"Why to the party of course ! You oddity,'to pretend to forget&#xD;
what absorbs us all. .Perhaps you won't go, of course you will&#xD;
not if madame will excuse you."&#xD;
"Ab yes; the party !" said Chris, flushing with sudden resolve..&#xD;
"I shall certainly go."&#xD;
" And wear that dress ?"&#xD;
" No, I shall not 1"  She tqok her hand off the knob and suf-&#xD;
fered Belle to pass her.&#xD;
" Then I will.try it on. If it suits me, I'll have it. It is as&#xD;
fresh as new."&#xD;
"I meant it for the rag man, Miss-Brandon."  Chris pushed it&#xD;
out of the way withhersfoot.' "If you wear it, you had better&#xD;

finish it with the gauntlets you took from me that horseback&#xD;
party.".&#xD;
" Thank you," answered Belle, unmoved in her 'examination&#xD;
of the dress. ."-Idon't wonder that.you go back to that day with&#xD;
pleasure. , it was quite an era in your life.' Just wait till I de-&#xD;
posit my fteasure in my room and I'll be 'all ready for'our 'Holy&#xD;
Mother. But Mignone, whether of us twain do you suppose will&#xD;
become this dress most in Mr. Groenveldt's 'eyes?  Just look in&#xD;
there'! (pulling 'Chris up before the mirror.) You shall let me&#xD;
have a waltz with him, his'dancing is the poetry of motion.  Wait&#xD;
for me. "&#xD;
Chris fairly stameped as Belle floated away, bother anger had&#xD;
the good effect to break up the hardness in her face. She waited,&#xD;
riot because Belle asked her, but because she forgot to' go, and&#xD;
that young beat soon .returned breathless, "'come, come, 'tis&#xD;
,past :seven 'already."  They entered the chilly hall, rid'Chris sat&#xD;
do'9n with a shiver, and began 'slowly tolhunt the music from the&#xD;
pile on the piano. "You must sing this duet aid leave *ine," said&#xD;
she. " I've my symphonies to.get up, and shall waste no time."&#xD;
As she raised her head 'to place the sheet upon the rack, a sight&#xD;
met her eyes which made her dizzy. It seemed too as if the rack&#xD;
had been 'empty when she sat down, and Belle Brandon was stand-,&#xD;
ing. 'behind her ready  to' take up her part. A square piece of&#xD;
cardboard-on it a clear sketch of her face 'and figure, as she&#xD;
had 'been the previous evening and so many evenings before; the&#xD;
tatters, the neglect, the frizzy hair, and surrounded by a 'chaos 'of&#xD;
books sand' papers, and exaggerated into a ludicrous caricature--&#xD;
beneath was written, " The Slattern at Home."  She  fastened&#xD;
her eyes upon the words, and though her very 'heart wept, there&#xD;
were no 'tears.'&#xD;
" Oh Chandos !"  It was all she -said, but Belle shrank away&#xD;
from her an instant, and studied her at a'distance.&#xD;
She turned the paper over in her fingers, and started 'and&#xD;
smiled. It. was the spirited picture of her, which her handsome&#xD;
-brothe had made that golden time when he 'had.showed her&#xD;
curls to Otho, and praised her beauty. She replaced it upon&#xD;
the rack, with a quiet hand, and turned upon Belle almost fiercely.&#xD;
&#xD;
WtDOWe Gotbsm'I' DAUXGETER.'         608&#xD;
' Come," .said she, "why don't you begin, and finish, and 'leave&#xD;
-me alone ?"&#xD;
":am waiting, Mignone, for a sight of the sketch you hAve&#xD;
put so carefully beyond niy reach. Will you not indulge me with&#xD;
a look,? I love pictures."&#xD;
",Indulge you! Not while :'min my senses. If you do not&#xD;
wish to sing your part, go away at once, and don't bother me all&#xD;
ithe morning."&#xD;
Belle smiled, 'and took her place by the piano, and pinched the&#xD;
leaf, preparatory to :turning over. . But if she .watched f r any&#xD;
shrinking or false notes, she watched in vain, for Chris not only&#xD;
kept her up to her part, but sang her own steadily to the  end,&#xD;
every 'tone true and pure as a bird's.&#xD;
"' There. ="said she, 'shortly,'closing the sheet, and .tossing i&#xD;
aside, "now go!"&#xD;
Belle obeyed, though she stopped at the door Ito feast herself&#xD;
with one more look; but the lofty composure and fixed resolution&#xD;
which had settled down upon 'Chris's face spoiled half her' tri-&#xD;
umph.&#xD;
Alone, the Spoor girl played on, steadying her soul with the&#xD;
heavenly -harmonies. Desolation, grief, despair, meltedd into a&#xD;
dirge over buried hopes, each note a prayer for help.&#xD;
Otho, with troubled countenance, passed the door. 'lie knew&#xD;
the touch  well, he had helped .to former it,: and he paused to&#xD;
listen as one stops by the coffin of' a dead friend. It was a pity&#xD;
to see how the pride had died out of his dark =face ; how his head&#xD;
dropped, his eyes sought the ground.  His faith in himself was&#xD;
shaken since his error in judgment was so, palpable. Such as he&#xD;
resent bitterly their mistakes, and are apt to visit them severely&#xD;
upon those who by their weakness or short-comings' have caused&#xD;
them. Still he placed his hand upon the knob, with a half pur-&#xD;
pose to enter, whether to upbraid Chris, or take her 'to his heart,&#xD;
he scarcely knew. The longing to see- her, to hear. her voice,&#xD;
very -nearly overcame every other feeling, but it passed;he with-&#xD;
drew his touch, as if 'angry with himself, and walked on and en.&#xD;
tered his 'mother's pair, where his friend' Max was waiting for&#xD;

him, as grandly quiet and as tenderly polite to madame as though&#xD;
he was at rest ; and he had reason to bless his natural reticence&#xD;
which:had hindered any mention of Chris or his love even to this&#xD;
dearest friend.&#xD;
.Before he had been gone many moments, the hall door opened&#xD;
softly, and the dear old Professor ,came to the young player's&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"What is it, Fraulein ?" asked he, taking both her hands, and&#xD;
looking into her face. "You make my heartache with your mu-&#xD;
sic; .it is as though you had no longer any hope."y&#xD;
She turned her stony ,face toward him, her tearless, glittering&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
'No hope," said she, "it is finished; there is nothing more to&#xD;
besaid or done, about it. . I do not deserve that you.should trouble&#xD;
yourself any further for me ; men do not like to be -seen in the&#xD;
company of ax slattern-that is the word, 'slattern.' She spoke&#xD;
very quietly, as if ,she: weretalking of an indifferent person. "I&#xD;
am marked, spotted from them all; they shrug their shoulders&#xD;
and roll up their eyes at me; I have to longer any part with&#xD;
them, so they draw away from me, they do not wish to touch me.&#xD;
Don't you stop here,' my master, they will come and find you, and&#xD;
then you will be ashamed. I am best alone."&#xD;
She withdrew her gaze from him, and dropped her eyes upon&#xD;
the keys, and tried. to pull her hands from his, as if she would&#xD;
go on playing. .&#xD;
He was uneasy, her stillness was so unnatural; and he took her&#xD;
forcibly to his arms, and laid her head upon his breast, his fatherly&#xD;
heart full of heavenly pity.&#xD;
! -No, no, child, you are not well alone, you are well with me;&#xD;
.daughter, tell me, tell me !"-&#xD;
He felt her throbbing temples and bounding pulse, and longed-&#xD;
to see tears in the dry eyes fixed on his in such hopeless suffering.&#xD;
"My child," said L he, shaking her passive shoulder gently, "do&#xD;
speak! what is it ?  Has somebody-has Otho, for instance-has&#xD;
he said an unkind thing? has he done you a 'wrong ?'&#xD;
"Oh no," she replied, with a .dash of bitterness, " oh, no, he&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITHS 'DAUGHTER         605&#xD;
&#xD;
can do no wrong ; he has spoken nothing unkind, far from it. I'&#xD;
alone am to blame."&#xD;
Soothingly, tenderly, the kind of -man waited till she was&#xD;
ready for his. sympathy, and with a tact and knowledge of&#xD;
woman's nature which none would have expected from the ab-&#xD;
sorbed scholar, he brought her to tell him her story, and'to finish&#xD;
it in tears upon his breast.&#xD;
"And Chandy, too," sobbed she, pointing to the sketch; "I&#xD;
think that hurts me most of all. My dear thoughtless brother !&#xD;
he has given me a blow -I cannot get over ; but I was to blame;&#xD;
I must have mortified him dreadfully ; he meant to give me- a&#xD;
lesson. I've got it, but oh ! it is hard, is it not?"&#xD;
" Cruel, contemptible, vicked poy !" said the Professor, vehe-&#xD;
mently, dashing off his glasses, and brandishing them up and&#xD;
down. " He .loves fun ; he makes vara goot}picture"; he made&#xD;
von of mine feedle and me togeder ; I did not care; I laugh very&#xD;
mooch when he show it me. But this- is not fun for mny little, girl,&#xD;
.this is von naughty crime. I cannot belief he do it, he is such a&#xD;
good fine fellow: Are you sure 'tis his ?"&#xD;
"Quite sure, sir ; there, is his own writing, and here on this&#xD;
side is a sketch he made of me at home when-when-when we&#xD;
were happy."  She dropped her head and sobbed afresh.&#xD;
j' He shall be excommunicate ! He shall be expulse ! He&#xD;
shall-"&#xD;
Chris stopped the denunciations of her friend, placing 'her hands&#xD;
upon his mouth.&#xD;
"No sir," said she, drying her tears, "you shall promise me&#xD;
not to say a word to'him or any one ;.«let everything drop."&#xD;
She had much trouble to bring him to promise, and he pur-&#xD;
posely died hard, because it was' -good for her to beg. When it&#xD;
was settled, he said, hesitatingly:&#xD;
" But Fraulein, I only just ask, you know, but is it true? are&#xD;
you what women despise so much, ' vone slattern ?' women Are so&#xD;
merciless to each other. I haven't seen it. You always look lovely&#xD;
to me. You study, and go snailing, and catch beetles ; yott paint,&#xD;

and play de sonata more petter ash any voman I know. I can-&#xD;
not make it come true-that slattern!"&#xD;
"4I am afraid I am it,'' replied Chris, smiling dreatily; "or at&#xD;
least , was yesterday. I did not mean to, indeed and indeed I&#xD;
did not, but somehow I always forget, and I think my things get&#xD;
.out of place easier than other people's  They won't stay pinned,&#xD;
and they won't stay buttoned, and they drop off and slip about.&#xD;
Oh dear, I'm afraid there's a screw wanting;, I'm going to. turn&#xD;
over a new leaf, new; but what if I do? what if I make myself&#xD;
ever-so perfect? I cannot get back my happiness again ; that is&#xD;
all over."&#xD;
" Do not say that, Fraulein ; I cannot think the good God will&#xD;
suffer .you to be unhappy." 'These are your trials; -you, have in&#xD;
your rich nature all resources for enjoyment." Happiness comes&#xD;
from within; happiness is knowledge, and the getting of. mooch&#xD;

You shall train your beetle hand to work among the oils, and&#xD;

Ue wiped4his glasses and, exa miied her carefully, with so anx-&#xD;

&#xD;
"I hope there is not hg aniss to-day, master, because thisis&#xD;
a careful day, a day over the leaf. I was ever s long putting&#xD;
on my things this morning; long enough to read a great many&#xD;
pages.'&#xD;
6' How would it be," he pyt his finger to, his lip and whispered,&#xD;
"so, s9, if I were to tweep watch all the while over your toilettes,&#xD;
and speak rough, and frown thus, when you laek something; put&#xD;
on my glasses and, review you each norming  Yogr curls, pretty&#xD;

ing his hand fondly upon them,) " and yoirg garments, ah, tb-ose gar-&#xD;

your soul's biddig, and they utter no guile. You cannot, be&#xD;
far wrong, I'm sure ; but we must be particular, ys, see we are&#xD;
watched."&#xD;
Chris laughed softly at the idea of his watching her-he, 'who&#xD;
was so every day tenderly cared for by his loving, dutiful daugh-&#xD;
ter, even to the tie of his black cravat, and whose pockets were&#xD;
systematically picked. of his handkerchiefs, lest he should carry&#xD;
his whole stock there at once.&#xD;
".I think I shall be hereafter always sufficient to myself," she&#xD;
said firmly. "If I feel danger I will call go mind some friendly&#xD;
glances I got of late, and I will study at my brother's picture of&#xD;
the 'slattern."'&#xD;
The dear old Professor looked wistfully at her kindling face,&#xD;
which had but now been lighted by pretty archness, and it pained&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"Come, Fraulein," said he,' "let us sing togeder; we've got&#xD;
haf an hour yet before the breakfast. Here is a vary delicete&#xD;

pany."  He took down his violin and drew up the strings. "The&#xD;
symphony in G, Fraulien."&#xD;
They played steadily on, till her spirit was in tune for the ar-&#xD;
duous duties of theft day, the sharp trials she had to pass. When&#xD;
he was .satisfied that it was the best which could be done, he&#xD;
smiled down at her, holding her-face between his two hands.&#xD;
"You are strong and quiet now, Fraulein."&#xD;
The tears sprang to her eyes; the sweet rich voice, the pro-&#xD;
tecting kindness of the action, were so like the bliss she had&#xD;
basked in, and'from which her folly had shut her out.&#xD;
" I think we will breakfast alone, we two," said he ; " we must&#xD;
go and beg Roger to smuggle us some coffee and kates. Ah, 'tis&#xD;
lucky Miss Filer's occupation is not, to-day, or we might get some&#xD;
failures."&#xD;
Chris never guessed that the dear old Professor had purposely&#xD;
kept her back to shield her from 'the public breakfast, with its&#xD;
prying eyes and whispered comments.&#xD;

CHAPTER FORTY-SECOND.&#xD;
B-ELLE AND MARY ANN HAVE IT OUT.&#xD;
WHILE Chris was pouring out her sorrows upon the breast of&#xD;
the kind old friend, hushing her sobs and getting strength for her&#xD;
resolves; sympathy and shrewd advice, which any other than she&#xD;
would have wondered to receive from so guileless, unworldly a&#xD;
scholar, such as a wise, tender mother might have bestowed, and&#xD;
in such soothing accents as fell in balm upon her bruised spirit,&#xD;
and which deepened the almost filial love she already felt for him&#xD;
--Miss Belle, having breakfasted hastily, had summoned her&#xD;
foil to her apartment. She came unwillingly, and :with loitering&#xD;
steps and lowering face.&#xD;
Miss Brandon's task was absorbing and her moments few ; only&#xD;
one day before the great party, and it may be that she displayed&#xD;
more tartness and impatience than was politic, and pointed her&#xD;
sneers and flings with too sharp a sting. .She must have done so,&#xD;
for Mary Ann's face grew more sullen' every moment,, and her&#xD;
pale eyes faded out, and her face got chalkier, a sure sign she&#xD;
was getting into a rage, and would be ready to use her claws if&#xD;
too hard pushed, as a cat will scratch and bite if cornered.&#xD;
Belle was fitting on the pansy robe ; she was touchy and cap-&#xD;
tious because she had to wear it, fresh and lovely as it was. She&#xD;
had tried to persuade her aunt to send her a rose-colored silk, and&#xD;
failing, had written to her uncle, but had got in return only a.&#xD;
sharp reprimand for her extravagance.&#xD;
"Oh dear, what a bean-pole that girl is !" said she, finding the&#xD;
,body all too narrow for her superb proportions. "No' breadth of&#xD;
shoulders at all !"&#xD;

She held her breath and pinched her sides, while Mary Ann&#xD;
struggled with the bottom hook.&#xD;
"There," said she, drawing in the air carefully, after it was&#xD;
conquered, "I look as if I was screwed into a vice, and as for&#xD;

for a heading to the wreath; this pattern is rather marked, but I&#xD;

how she looked in this dress, as cool and indifferent as possible at&#xD;
me; but :c'est une chose inouie, the smile she got up the moment&#xD;
Gravity cane in sight-I could have slapped her!"&#xD;
" I remember too. She's as beautiful as she is good, and I&#xD;
wish I was like 'her."&#xD;
Belle turned in astonishment, and opened her steely eyes upon&#xD;
th  foil with superb contempt. This was new utterance, in a&#xD;
new tone, and must be squelched.&#xD;
" Take the scissors," said she, " and trim this body, if you have&#xD;
finished your virtuous remarks. What a pity papa the deacon is&#xD;
not-present! How they would rejoice his pious heart ; he would&#xD;
cheat his next customer with double relish. Suppose we make&#xD;
up a special anxious seat, and send for that De-sweet lips, who&#xD;
dotes on the young sisters, and  pokes his holy nose under their&#xD;
hats, to comfort you. Oh, the piety and the meanness I have seen&#xD;
in your charming home. It is enough to sicken one of the name&#xD;
of religion forever."&#xD;
Pa and ma wasvery good -to you, I'm sure ; and you are no&#xD;
kin of ours neither, if it comes to that."&#xD;
":Ha, ha! how very funny! Quite clever, upon my word.-&#xD;
Kin to you! .that is a good joke! No, my Mary Ann, I rejoice&#xD;
to, be certain that no drop of your thin blood defiles my veins. My&#xD;
ancestors were gentlefolks. The Brandons wore a hawk for a'&#xD;
crest when they went to fight for the Holy Sepulchre, though I&#xD;
must own that it was very' silly of them to spill their blood and&#xD;
waste their money in' such a way. Still, they were better than&#xD;
'to ancestors. Your maternal grandfather boiled soap, and yotr&#xD;
&#xD;
grandmother dipped candies. Such is life. I have found you&#xD;
useful, and now please continue to be it by cutting delicately."&#xD;
" Where do you want me .to: cut ? ~ I don't know nothing about&#xD;
it, I'm sure."&#xD;
" Trim these shoulders. That.dowdy called this a low neck, I&#xD;
believe, but: she is as lean as a magpie. Be careful; don't snatch&#xD;
from me! be respectful if ,youplease; remember I've a little au-&#xD;
tograph of yours safe up in my desk. I can ,spring it on you&#xD;
any time, and get you sent home in disgrace, and then won't your&#xD;
mother murder you?"&#xD;
Mary Ann took the scissors and began to snip. - Her under lip&#xD;
dropped, and her eyes looked threatening.&#xD;
" Take care!" screamed Belle. " You are gouging that out of&#xD;
all shape, and you are doing it on purpose!"&#xD;
She dashed away the hand which held the scissors, and the&#xD;
points.entered her plump arm, inflicting a sharp wound and caus-&#xD;
ing the blood to spurt .out over the creamy flesh, and trickle&#xD;
down, a ruby stain.&#xD;
"Eh, you cat !" .She turned and struck the .foil a stinging&#xD;
blow on her cheek, which brought out four finger marks in faint&#xD;
red on the chalky skin. "Now ! be careful and attend when&#xD;
you are bid !"&#xD;
Mary Ann threw down the scissors. "You may cut it your-&#xD;
self!' I'll not touch it again ! You have slapped me once too of-&#xD;
ten, Belle Brandon. You are theoneto take care now."&#xD;
Belle flew. at her, her face pale, her'.eyes the color of a moon-&#xD;
lit lake. The animal mastered for the .moment the wily woman&#xD;
w-ho usually held it so well in check ; and as Mary Ann's temper&#xD;
was up, and her claws all ready, the beauty might.have.got marks&#xD;
on her handsome.face:which it would have .cost her some ingen-&#xD;
ious lying, to account for, had not madame appeared in -the door-&#xD;
way. She was about to' propose a little treat'to her favorite-a&#xD;
visit to the conservatory,-and she stopped, astonished, scarcely&#xD;
'believing her eyes.&#xD;
"What!", said she, ' what does this mean, young ladies !"&#xD;
Quickly as the.lightning flashes did Belle rule her features,&#xD;

command them to archness; and she sprang forward with a gay&#xD;
laugh, her hands clasped in childish penitence.&#xD;
"Ah, madame, you saw our little drama, 'the Highfliers.' We&#xD;
did not mean to make so much noise. Oh dear ! I'm quite out of&#xD;
breath. Please don't mind our wild spirits, we're all agog over&#xD;
the party. This is to be my dress; is it not lovely?"  She kept&#xD;
carefully her well arm towards madame, and threw a threatening&#xD;
look at Mary Ann, who stood lowering and sullen, with wrathful,&#xD;
cattish eyes, behind-her.&#xD;
"It seems to me that Miss Williams looks rather- cross for an&#xD;
actress," said madame significantly.;&#xD;
"I ain't no actress!' She struck me with the hair-brush. We&#xD;
ain't gay. She is mad because I could'nt suit her. She is al-&#xD;
ways scolding and twitting me, making fun and getting me laughed&#xD;
at. She wears all my things ; them is my earrings she's' got in&#xD;
her ears this minute. She makes me wash, and iron, and sew;&#xD;
she treats me worse nor a nigger. She is a nasty, mean, under-&#xD;
handed-peacock !"&#xD;
" Silence ! Miss Williams ;- very improper language. What is&#xD;
the matter with your arm, Miss Brandon ?"  Madame took the&#xD;
round member in her hand and looked closely at it.&#xD;
" Oh nothing, dearest Madame, nothing ,I assure you; pray&#xD;
don't ask me; indeed I cannot speak."  She threw a hurried&#xD;
glance at Mary Ann, and whispered, " such a temper ! poor child,&#xD;
so violent sometimes ; don't punish her, I entreat, for my sake."&#xD;
" I cannot suffer this to pass," said madame, much disturbed.&#xD;
"In all my experience among young ladies, I am happy to say&#xD;
I have never met such a case ; personal violence is revolting!&#xD;
Stab her with the sharp scissors? Why, Miss Williams, you&#xD;
shock me more than I can express ! Such a temper will get you&#xD;
into an insane retreat, or a prison, if you don't have a care."&#xD;
"I did'nt; Madame," sniveled Mary Ann. "She pushed off my&#xD;
hand when Iwas cutting her dress, and stuck herself, and now&#xD;
she wants to pretend I'm to blame, as if I went to do it 'a pur-&#xD;
pose. Oh ! Madame, you don't know nothing about her. She's&#xD;
struck me often and often before. Just look at my cheek! them's&#xD;
&#xD;
her finger-marks. She's always mighty sweet when you are&#xD;
round; but just you see her when 4she don't care for nobody,&#xD;
then can't she be cross and hateful enough."&#xD;
Belle resorted to various expedients to squelch her foil, but she&#xD;
would not be -squelched, and the accusations she went on pouring&#xD;
out in not very choice English, sounded so true that 'Madame&#xD;
silenced Belle and ordered her to go on ; and it all came out&#xD;
about the picture, and the post-office letters, and a hundred tricks'&#xD;
besides, which Belle had trusted to Mary Ann's cowardice to con-&#xD;
ceal. "And Chris has been crying about it. I peeped in and&#xD;
saw her, and I wish I'd a been dead before I did it. And she&#xD;
goes on about pa and ma; they was always too good to her.&#xD;
She may make much of what she 's got out of us; she shant&#xD;
never darken our 'doors again."&#xD;
"Miss Brandon," Madame touched 3elle's wounded arm with&#xD;
her finger, "upon your honor explain to me the real cause of&#xD;
this. I am sorry to say that in trifles, both in school and other-&#xD;
wheres, I have reason to doubt Miss Williams' veracity. Her&#xD;
reports are inaccurate, and the, matter of that stained handker-&#xD;
chief has never been cleared up."&#xD;
" Let me tell, Madame. I'll speak true. I upset the ink and&#xD;
wiped it up with that handkerchief when I went to get the sketch&#xD;
for her, (pointing to Belle.) I did'nt know what she wanted of&#xD;
it. She told me to burn it up, but Miss Filer came before I had&#xD;
time ; and that is the truth."&#xD;
"It seems to me that my pet is rather making a fool of her-&#xD;
self," said Belle. "I think she is ready for the retreat now. I&#xD;
have no idea what she is driving at, I am sure. As for sending&#xD;
her to Mr. Goldsmith's room, that is absurd. Why should I do&#xD;
it? I saw the sketch for the first time when it stood on the&#xD;
piano, where Chris found it.- She will tell you so."  Belle's eyes&#xD;
were as clear and blue as a summer sky, and she stood gracefully&#xD;
and quietly gazing in madame's face while she talked.&#xD;
" You are a horrid liar, Belle Brandon !"&#xD;
Belle shrugged her shoulders. "Don't mind herMadame ; I&#xD;
assure you I don't in the least."&#xD;

"cYou saw her strike me, Madame,.and you .see my face ! it&#xD;
shows for itself. As I hope to go to heaven when I die, I've told&#xD;
you the 'truth."  Mary Ann covered up her face and sobbed&#xD;
aloud.       .&#xD;
"I am very sorry;" 17egan madame unwillingly. She hated to&#xD;
believe such things about her pet, handsome pupil. The strong&#xD;
contrast in the personal.appearance of the two girls affected her&#xD;
at ,this moment insensibly. Belle's face was so ingenuous, so&#xD;
sweetly simple. -"2I must take this matter into consideration, and&#xD;
at the proper time and place I will advise you of mgy decision. I&#xD;
cannot permit either of you to mingle in the festivities{of the&#xD;
evening. Pleasures intended to .reward good scholarship and&#xD;
ladylike deportment are not for you. Miss Brandon, the charges&#xD;
against you are of so serious a nature that .I must investigate&#xD;
carefully. I hope you will be able to clear yourself; but the&#xD;
passion you have indulged in this morning, of which the proof .is&#xD;
evident, is an unladylike exhibition, which deserves .punishment.&#xD;
Go to your room, Miss Williams. I .forbid further communica-&#xD;
tion with Miss .fBrandon till these affairs are settled."&#xD;
" You don't need to forbid, Madame ; I don't desire ever to set&#xD;
eyes on her again, I'm sure."  Mary Ann got.up and walked off&#xD;
half bent--shoulders up to'her ears--blowing her red nose and&#xD;
snuffling.&#xD;
"Adieu! precious pet!",said Belle, kissing her hand behind&#xD;
madame's back. It looked ill, but she did not despair of hushing&#xD;
it up if she could stave off inquiries till Chandos was gone, and&#xD;
he was to leave on the morrow early, having stopped over a cou-&#xD;
ple of days.for the party; and she fervently hoped that madame&#xD;
would find enough to do to occupy. every moment. If Chandy&#xD;
was only out of the way, there was no proof against her, and he&#xD;
would have the, onus of the sketch. The stained handkerchief&#xD;
looked black, but she could manage somehow.&#xD;
"You will allow me to compete, for the prizes, Madame, I&#xD;
hope."&#xD;
"Severity would lead me to confine you to your apartment,&#xD;
Miss Brandon; but I shall be just. Yes, you may compete as&#xD;
&#xD;
though in good and regular standing. I shall waive the affair till&#xD;
examination is over."&#xD;
'Thanks Madame. I shall not mind losing the party in the&#xD;
least, if you will only take my word. I am innocent, believe me."&#xD;
"That must be proven, my dear. I hope you will be able to&#xD;
make it plain. If you have anything to say to me, any confes-&#xD;
sions to make, you may come to my dressing-room this evening&#xD;
at seven."&#xD;
'- Of course I shall appear at examination. You cannot afford&#xD;
to miss my voice out of your.programme, or my handsome face&#xD;
from your' rostrum," sneered Belle, as Madame's heavy silk rus-&#xD;
tled out of sight.&#xD;

CHAPTER FORTJY-THIRD-&#xD;
CONFLICTS.&#xD;
Madame Groenveldt's arrangements were perfect. She gave&#xD;
her attention to the minutest details, as she grasped the, finished&#xD;
whole. All her guests were made comfortable, were royally en-,&#xD;
tertained. The old farm house on the other side of the pond,&#xD;
and quite hidden from the grand mansion by its greenery, was&#xD;
swept and garnished and 'great fires up the chimney roared.'&#xD;
There lodged the Papas and Mamas who flocked together to ex-&#xD;
ult- and rejoice over their offspring, and enjoy the festivities which&#xD;
were the talk of the country round. When .that ancient edifice&#xD;
overflowed, the gothic cottage, owned by old Mr. Bloombarg,&#xD;
the bachelor savant, who passed his summers there fishing in the&#xD;
quiet lake, and wandering about the dim old woods, and who was&#xD;
supposed to be an ancient lover of Madame's, so tender and re-&#xD;
spectful was he ; kissing her hand with vast devotion, bringing&#xD;
flowers for her boquet, blush rose buds, sweet peas, camilias-&#xD;
but school girls are always fancying love-passages. They weave&#xD;
them out of their silly brains, Spin them from less than nothing&#xD;
and vanity. At any rate, his gothic cottage on the hill, overlook-&#xD;
ing Magic lake, was placed at the service of the lady whom he de-&#xD;
lighted to honor, and its pleasant rooms saw rare sights ; pretty,&#xD;
fair girlish faces, pressed to warm old hearts, honest eyes swim-&#xD;
ming in tears of love and joy, and beautiful mother tenderness&#xD;
gushing out in caresses over its offspring.&#xD;
Madame's servants -went hither 'and thither, beaming on the&#xD;
guests, and cheerfully doing their bidding. She had a way like&#xD;
(616)&#xD;
&#xD;
magnetism with her servants. They always took an interest: a&#xD;
state of mind which some housekeepers long for in their help, and&#xD;
seek but never find.&#xD;
The dear old Professor had got on a dress coat, white neck-tie;&#xD;
and the posey in his-button-hole, without, which he never consid-&#xD;
ered himself festive. Bertha, hovered around him with loving&#xD;
touches. When she had finished his toilette, she nestled in his&#xD;
arms and tried to hider a-couple -of tears, which were dropping&#xD;
silently.&#xD;
"Don't you mind it, dear, he is only a poy after all," said the&#xD;
Professor, wiping them away with his bandana, and -kissing her,&#xD;
" Yes papa, I know," whispered Bertha, "but I'm only a girl,&#xD;
and I love him. He's, good and handsome, and the kindest fellow&#xD;
sometimes. He looks out of his eyes at me so sweet and true ;&#xD;
don't mind my being silly for once papa, (blushing.)  I won't be&#xD;
any more."&#xD;
His kind heart ached for her heart-ache, and he listened ten-&#xD;
derly to what some parents would have checked as ridiculous&#xD;
nonsense.&#xD;
" He'll be hme bye and bye."&#xD;
"Oh yes, papa, and then he won't be a boy any longer, and he&#xD;
.won't care any thing about me, and I shall have forgotten all&#xD;
about lim, (I hope,) and I shall be very useful and very good.&#xD;
I'm going to be a teacher you know, and after a while I shall&#xD;
look just like Miss Filer and rub my red - nose. I shall never&#xD;
marry anybody, never. I am going to stay with you and keep&#xD;
you tidy and nice, and you must not get tired of me. I'm so glad&#xD;
you spoke of'him. Good kind papa;,there was'nt another person&#xD;
in the whole world to whom I could have confessed,; such a dear&#xD;
father confessor, and I feel ever so much better, quite comforted;&#xD;
after all it is. my secret. Our secret now, papa, though how you&#xD;
found it out I can't contrive I'm sure. NQ one else dreams of it,&#xD;
and we won't ever speak of it any more. IL don't look as if I had&#xD;
been crying, do I ?"&#xD;
She ran to the mirror and peered in at herself, and hugged her&#xD;

father, and after half an hour of quiet sitting with her face on&#xD;
his shoulder, she reached up and kissed him softly and left him.&#xD;
The bustle of dressing was over. The graduating class were&#xD;
all assembled in the library. Madame reviewed them critically.&#xD;
White muslins),tucked sashes,.one camelia among its shining leaves.&#xD;
in the breast knot. This was the order, and she looked to, see it&#xD;
faithfully obeyed. Not an ornament or jewel of any kind; the&#xD;
whitesgloves, Jouvin's best, she always ordered herself, and thewhite&#xD;
kid boots. It was well that Amecican necks and shoulders are&#xD;
so nearlyperfect, and arms so,wellrounded, for no relieving brace-&#xD;
lets were allowed, no gauds, no earrings, no tinkling ornaments.&#xD;
The frizzly, a in frantic style had not come then, and I question&#xD;
if the Rosenbloom:'Graduates would have been permitted to ap-&#xD;
pear thus if it had. Madame's brows expanded in bland appro-&#xD;
bation. -  Perfect, young ladies," said she, "leaving nothing to be&#xD;
desired in your apparel. I hope you will this day demonstrate to&#xD;
your' friends that you are as apples of gold, set in pictures of sil-&#xD;
ver. You also, my dear young pupils," she ran her eyes qver the&#xD;
dress coats, spotless vests and shining boots which were scattered&#xD;
about among the muslins, "are in excellent taste. You look like&#xD;
American gentlemen. Foreigners may say what they please; we&#xD;
women have occasion to know that there is a triue, delicate, pure&#xD;
hearted kindness for us in the hearts of our husbands and brothers,&#xD;
which makes our comfort their chiefest care, and our happiness&#xD;
their constant delight."  She paused with a smile and bow, and&#xD;
the young gentlemen all bowed in return. "Your class-color is&#xD;
well chosen also. Blue--truth--"I think it belongs of right to, all&#xD;
of you.' That you may prize it aboye rubies and live it in your&#xD;
lives will be my constant prayer. Here you will find the order&#xD;
of your march to the hall, and I hope you will be' satisfied with&#xD;
my coupling, which,'however, lasts only through the day's exercises,&#xD;
and the first quadrille this evening; further ] have no jurisdiction,&#xD;
and I hope kind Providence will order it wisely hereafter. I can-&#xD;
not sufficiently thank you,'my dear pupils, for your kind attention&#xD;
to, my advice and instructions, and in severing the bonds which&#xD;
have heyh us together for four pleasant years, I feel sure that you&#xD;
&#xD;
will carry joy and happiness to, the hpmes you are ftted to.adorn;&#xD;
and. I look forward to hearing of you after a suitable time in&#xD;
households of your own, which .I feel sure you, (bowing to the&#xD;
young men,)-will admirably govern, and (transferring her bow&#xD;
and smile to the girlstIknow that the hearts of your husbinda may&#xD;
safely trust in you. . I believe none of you are too strong-minded,&#xD;
and feel sure that each of you will take kindly to woman's true&#xD;
mission."  Then' she kissed them" all round, and -wiped her eyes&#xD;
and blessed them 'in a grand motherly way,,which repressed any&#xD;
inclination to stixile, and. which i pressed them the whole day.&#xD;
Only the junior and senior classes were allowed public examina,&#xD;
tion. The others being privately prepared- for, their grades.&#xD;
Madame's arrangements of nusic, declamation, etc.,- were dra-&#xD;
matic in effect, and always delighted the audience. The great&#xD;
Lyceum hall was full to. overflowing, with, an expectant crowd, all&#xD;
buzz and flutter, whispering and smiling in the best possible hu-&#xD;
mor with themselves. and their hosts. Candy, Sam, and half a&#xD;
dozen. other good looking fellows officiating as marshals, fbr the&#xD;
- day and evening, were passing about, dropping ,gay words among&#xD;
the throng. Their batons of office in, their white gloved hands&#xD;
and vast satin.rosettes adorning the right breast of their swallow-&#xD;
tails. Rumor whispered - that. madame always elected for 'her&#xD;
ushers the handsomest fellows in school, and if she did we can&#xD;
only commend-her taste and discretion. The stage'was honored by&#xD;
a double row of double-chinned elderly gentlemen in white or&#xD;
buff waistcoats, who sat cross-legged and twiddled their thumbs&#xD;
and looked profound. These were the committee who awarded&#xD;
the prizes.. In front of them, a row of chairs.for the graduates:&#xD;
Precisely as the clock struck nine, they came in two and two.&#xD;
Professor Noble having Miss Filer on his arm, at their head; all&#xD;
necks were craned up, and many comments found voice while the&#xD;
procession passed along.&#xD;
" Massy me, if there ai'nt our Sairy along ,o that 'handsome&#xD;

eyes rested on her lovely child whom she had not seen in a. white&#xD;
dress since her great loss, and her face saddened among her mem-&#xD;
ories.- In the mean time they were Eall seated. They had re-&#xD;
ceived. a 'subdued reception from the Art scholars, and Alumni, as&#xD;
demonstrative as madame's strict rules permitted-who all wore&#xD;
their class-colors, and were fond of talking' about the. class of&#xD;
"sixty this and that," and took on airs of grandeur and - experi-&#xD;
ence. The competitors for the prizes were in a stall like a pri-&#xD;
vate box in a theatre, except that it reached to the ceiling, was&#xD;
arched in and had tiers of seats rising toward the: back, and a&#xD;
side door which opened upon the stage. They were allowed to&#xD;
use their own taste 'in colors and style of dress. Juan Gonzalez,&#xD;
a Matanzas scholar, set next Chris, and was a competitor .for&#xD;
English composition. Sabrina on her 'other side, tried for the&#xD;
French letter, and the rest of the class, about twenty in number,&#xD;
were'seated=to please themselves and made a pretty grouping, and&#xD;
none there were lovelier thanBelle Brandon, who, for some un-&#xD;
explained whim, bad chosen'to come out in dead black silk. She&#xD;
had-solid gold bracelets' and necklace, and on her blonde hair,&#xD;
which she had turned back, in light waves, she wore a lace&#xD;
ruche whichhad nearly the effect of a widow's cap. Indeed she&#xD;
said as she put it on,- I should look well as a widow. I'lmarry&#xD;
a rich -nan so as to enjoy the dress, when I 'get rid of him." She.&#xD;
sat directly in front, where the chequered lights from the stained&#xD;
Cathrine-vheel played over her polished-arms, and-she made smiles&#xD;
and dimples for the audience though she seemed absorbed in the&#xD;
dark browed Cuban- at her side.    Poor, foolish, hot-headed&#xD;

to his friend-Peebles, who often. claimed her attention. . Butthe&#xD;
time for talking was over. The prayer was 'about to, be offe ed,&#xD;
and Madame's eyes ran around the hall to be sure that.all were&#xD;
in their places and.all attentive. Then came a quartette axnd chorus&#xD;
-by the Professor's Beethoven Club, then some recitations and;so&#xD;
on till Professor Noble called, "Juan Gonzalez,'f and the young-&#xD;
ster rose and threaded his way among the seats and passed oyt of&#xD;
the door, faced the audience and made his. bow.&#xD;
"Bavicca, the Cid's best friend."&#xD;
His proud bearing, dark fade, intense passionate eyes, remind-&#xD;
ed Chris of Otho, as she had seen him by the pond, looking 4own&#xD;
at the lily pads, at the wall, and a hundred other times. Nay&#xD;
their very voices were the same, and she pressed her hand upon-&#xD;
her heart while she listened, and she threw her .wild deer glance&#xD;
around her once or twice, seeking to flee. Belle reached,across&#xD;
the two who sat letween, and tapped. her arm with her black&#xD;
fan.&#xD;
"Your chance is lost, Mignone, I think. This is poetry married&#xD;
to music."&#xD;
Chris- drew away with a start, and frowned at her arm, and was&#xD;
herself again in an instant, calm and attentive. Gonzalez had&#xD;
finished and made his parting bow, amidst shouts of applause,&#xD;
and Professor Noble read from his programme, " Christabel Gold-&#xD;
smith, English composition."  Chris rose quietly from- her place,&#xD;
next Sabrina, who had been holding her .hand ever since she. sat&#xD;
down. Though no word was ever spoken between them this thought-&#xD;
ful friend knew intuitively her trouble.. She had witnessed the&#xD;
meeting in the library, and had almost hated Otho ever since, and&#xD;
her heart ached to see. Chris so still and passive. She, knew her&#xD;
so well, and had revelled so often in her gorgeous thoughts, her&#xD;
rich revelations of her inner life, her artist dreams, her fairy tales,&#xD;
and the reposeful woman-talks when good common sense guided&#xD;

NobQdcould 'shield her from the consequences of her habits, she&#xD;
must conquer alone.&#xD;
She dropped a slight courtesy, before the sea of facesand un-&#xD;
rolled her paper. The folds'of hei. silver grey poplin-fell about her&#xD;
slefndr figure, little muslin ruffles shaded her throat and =wrists&#xD;
delicately fluted; 'her hands wee'clearcut,:r-osy tinted ;,:and Sher'&#xD;
marvelous hair of shining chestnut threaded with .gold, plainly&#xD;
tucked behind her ears, and falling a rich mass below her waist.;&#xD;
and her face, so still, so emotionless. Madame threw a troubled&#xD;
look at her. She was so 'perfeet tin her quiet repose, like a grey&#xD;
statue.&#xD;
"CONFLICTS."&#xD;
Her voice dropped, clear,  vibrating. Every ear in the great&#xD;
hall caught the word, and the people moved uneasily, and sought&#xD;
each other's eyes. 'She; looked as if all her conflicts were over,&#xD;
and she waited for the end. She raised her dropped lids, and&#xD;
swept the , audience in a swift glance, and a flood of crimson&#xD;
surged over her cheeks. The forced unnatural calm dissolved,&#xD;
her red lips curved sorrowfully, and a mist floated before her&#xD;
beseeching b-own 'eyes, so tender, yet so despairing. She 'met a&#xD;
look in the crowd which had power to sway her soul, to hold it&#xD;
beneath its spell': a face she-'had not seen since that wretched&#xD;
moment, so-hateful to remembere. A remorseless judge, a stern&#xD;
sorrowful countenance, 'marble pale, great intense eyes which fas-&#xD;
tened 'her's, and would not release them; but with a shadow over&#xD;
them which veiled her out from love and joy, and left her a wan-&#xD;
derer in the cold world 'forever. And she had 'seen 'them look so&#xD;
'differently to that. She knew how-dear protecting fondness could&#xD;
light their shadow. Alas ! disgust and scorn had' shot'at her from&#xD;
those same:eyes, and'beaten her down from her high place. Mat&#xD;
spoke to his friend and 'he turned to answer. Chris- shuddeed&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
and trembled, and gathered up her strength.' She knew what her&#xD;
future must be, she had marked it out and prayed over it, and she&#xD;
would have no pity. She moistened her tongue, and pressing her&#xD;
handkerchief to her lips an instant she commenced. The silence&#xD;
was breathless. They hung on her words, and were still 'silent&#xD;
when she ceased ; not a murmur of applause greeted her, but&#xD;
every eye followed her to her place. The wise "old heads con-&#xD;
ferred together, and the 'chairman rose and 'announced the prize,&#xD;
awarded to Christabel Goldsmith. 'Gonzalez offered his hand&#xD;
with a smile, and whispered compliment. Chris did not catch its&#xD;
import, sh-e was thinking of the 'face in the crowd, but she took&#xD;
the Arm he offered her and came back, 'and stood on the rostrum&#xD;
while the chairman addressed some very flowery remarks to her;&#xD;
and then Professor Noble took the curious toy of a work table,&#xD;
inlaid and carved with 'Chinese patience, in his hands, and offered&#xD;
it to her, and showed her the odd-shaped, delicately' wrought&#xD;
hinders, and bobbins, and knicknacks, with a funny puzzled ;smile&#xD;
and shake of the head at his utter ignorance of their use.&#xD;
" Of Latin prose, algebraic quantities, 'syllogisms, 'I profess my&#xD;
self a judge, but these!" he shrugged his shoulder and spread&#xD;
his hands.&#xD;
Those about them laughed, and Roger took the toy and passed.&#xD;
down the aisles in order that all the ladies might examine it. It&#xD;
Was pronounced a "perfect love," a "wonderful contrivance," 'a&#xD;
"curus thing, and so on, according to the dialects of the be-&#xD;
holders, and Chris obeyed Herr Groenveldt's sumions to the.&#xD;
piano, where Belle was' already seated. She took the - sheet he&#xD;
offered her,. the prelude ran smoothly 'and artistically on, 'and&#xD;
Chris opened her lips to commence her solo-something jarred-&#xD;
were the chords false ?  She 'threw a frowning, troubled look&#xD;
upon the fair pianist, and caught her treachery in a 'tell-tale eye-&#xD;
beam 'before she had time to veil it beneath her dropped lids.&#xD;
"I will not be your victim" said she, laying down the music;&#xD;
"you are trying to throw me out."&#xD;
Madame fidgeted, annoyed at the'unwonted jarring in her ma-&#xD;
chinery, but 'it 'was only for an instant. Before she knew where&#xD;

&#xD;
she was, Miss Brandon found herself standing by the- piano,-in.&#xD;
stead of seated before it.&#xD;
"iEermit me," Otho had said, touching her arm, "I will ac-&#xD;
company, you," and he took the vacated place and ran his fingers&#xD;
over the keys.&#xD;
" Begin," said he, raising his eyes and bowing.-&#xD;
-  A flood of memory 'dashed over Chris;' she. did not wonder&#xD;
how, he caine there, or why ; she thought only of the other time&#xD;
when she lbad sung his music, and he had said to her "begin."&#xD;
She drew her breath with asob: his eyes fixed on hers, his busi-&#xD;
ness air, his body swaying slightly to the.motion of his hands, so&#xD;
coolly attentive to :the task before him, as if he saw a singing&#xD;
pupil in hersand nothing more, forced her to self-control, and she&#xD;
tookup the sheet and commenced.&#xD;
The true, pure tones swelled into the ,passionate. utterance,&#xD;
Holy; Mother, ggide his footsteps," the cry of a sick soul, a sac-&#xD;
rificialprayer!      .&#xD;
Belle, had not intended to sing, her part, and fully expected a&#xD;
break-down, which she would cover grandly in a dashing render-&#xD;
ing of one of her lovely songs, and had the music ready; but she&#xD;
resolved not to lose her triumph, for which she had practiced,&#xD;
tirelessly, and the more as she thought Otho would take her part&#xD;
if she left it to him, she struck ii at the proper' place, with her&#xD;
rich contralto, and poured forth her threaded notes rapidly,.clear-&#xD;
ly, softly; but through all it was as if a mocking spirit mingled&#xD;
with .the petition, and she the while watched the pair she de-&#xD;
tested, gloating, over their sufferings.&#xD;
So wrapt was Chris in her own emotions, that she stood still&#xD;
till the echoes of her voice died away, with her head bent and her&#xD;
heart beating. She scarcely heard the murmur of applause, she&#xD;
was unconscious of the whispered   comments and    inquiries&#xD;
among the .listeners; she remembered only herself and the man&#xD;
she loved who. sat at her side, so close that her garments touched&#xD;
him, and who had not a word or look for her.&#xD;
When he rose and walked away, she sighed as if a spell were&#xD;
lifted, and passing her hand across her forehead, she staggered,&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDS'IfTH''S -DAUGSRTER.         .625&#xD;
and would have fallen, but the watchful. Professor laid his hand&#xD;
upon her arm, and led her back to her stall; out of sight of the&#xD;
audience, he detained her a moment.&#xD;
"Will you'choose to withdraw, Fraulein ?" whispered he. "Are&#xD;
you not taxing your strength toohardly? Nay, do not weep be-&#xD;
fore all these gazing eyes. It is better for you to go to your&#xD;
room; I will make de excuse to madame."&#xD;
His tender, sympathetic heart ached to see her, but he could not&#xD;
help her; these two must work out the problem of their lives for&#xD;
themselves; he could not even offer advice to his haughty son.&#xD;
" Thanks, no," said Chris; "if I falter now, how shall I bear,&#xD;
all the long days to come?' I will take in place-at once."&#xD;
She drank eagerly' of the iced water he offered, and raising his&#xD;
hand.to her lips, with a pitiful, patient smile, she passed through&#xD;
the door and resumed her seat.&#xD;
Sabrina, who had inher lap the French letter.prize, a cabinet&#xD;
picture, " The Gipsey Bride," which.she liked for its fancied re-&#xD;
semblance to her sister Pauline, held it up as Chris sat down, and&#xD;
she managed the needful smile and speech.&#xD;
Gonzalez had gotten the Latin prose, Zambrano the Eschylus,&#xD;
others of the competitors had won successes, and were passing&#xD;
them about and admiring them; and now, after an oration, it be-&#xD;
came Belle's turn to display, and play; Zambrano conducted her&#xD;
to the, instrument, and held her boquet, and turned her music.&#xD;
She drew off her gloves carefully, and commenced a brilliant&#xD;
fantasia, all runs and arpeggios, into which she put a soul, though&#xD;
where she got it was a mystery. Her execution was faultless ;&#xD;
the harmonies ran-=-trickled off her .fingers, not a note blurred,&#xD;
not one missing.&#xD;
She brought down the house-;no such applause had greeted&#xD;
any performance that day, and when she stood up and took&#xD;
a step forward, with her boquet in her hand, and - bowed, and&#xD;
lifted her modest, swimming eyes, and parted her lips in a lovely&#xD;
smile of childish pleasure, everyman and boy in. the hall ,felt&#xD;
himself personally appealed to. Here was innocence to be shelb&#xD;
tered,,purity to be worshipped; and the remarks whioh reached&#xD;

her-=- j lovely," "beautiful,"~"so simple,". "so sweet," "what a&#xD;
'darling," and so on, were sweetest music to her. She, could not'&#xD;
forbear one half-veiled, triumphant glance at Madame as she re-&#xD;
theated.&#xD;
That dignitary could .not keep down her' pleasure; it would&#xD;
fash through the sternness she desired to; manifest toward her&#xD;
showy, beautiful pupil, who acquitted herself everywhere so ad-&#xD;
mirably; aid she secretly regretted the necessity of shutting her&#xD;
out from the evening's enjoyments, which shedwould so adorn,&#xD;
and she turned over in her mind- the best and wisest things to&#xD;
say, when she should come in tears of pretty penitence and im-&#xD;
plore her pardon, and beg a remission of her sentence,'as she had.&#xD;
done often and often before, and throw herself on her mercy-she&#xD;
was so lovely in 'tears. True, she had struck Mary Ann Wil-&#xD;
liams, but that girl was trying, she had undoubtedly been much&#xD;
provoked; as to'the rest, Mary Ann was 'proven to be a liar, and&#xD;
she would not rashly decide.- And' madame also glanced toward&#xD;
the stall where 'Christabel sat with drooping 'shoulders, her 'eyes&#xD;
fixed on vacancy, her lips compressed, her whole attitude absent&#xD;
and absorbed:; and she thought she. could be more comfortable&#xD;
with this brilliant;_showy, ready-witted beauty, who was sufficient&#xD;
to herself and to 'any occasion, than with one whom she could not&#xD;
comprehend or assimilate to; and wondered and lamented for the&#xD;
thousandth time over her only'son's blind infatuation. Bertha&#xD;
also came in for share of her regretful thoughts ;' she 'had taken&#xD;
no,prizes, and she had developed: whims and follies in her friend-&#xD;
ships. She systematically ignored Miss Brandon and 'her blan-&#xD;
dishments, and she loved Chris. 'She had seen her cover her face&#xD;
with kisses, and she grudged them every one.&#xD;
" That also comes of a liking which I wish had no existence,&#xD;
and which I fear may end in sorrow: Bertha is a steady, good&#xD;
child, constant in her' friendships."&#xD;
Her eyes followed" her thought till they lighted ' on handsome&#xD;
Chandos, leaning idly on the edge of the stall, conversing smil-&#xD;
ingly with:Sabrina, Zoe, and Zambrano, and eating bon-bons out&#xD;
of a pretty bor which Peebles had' sent over to the girls with his&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITH'S DAUGHTER.        '    627&#xD;
compliments.. Bertha sat near them, but her face was quiet;&#xD;
though Zoe's arm was around her waist, and she spoke lovingly&#xD;
to her, and gave her sweet looks, the mother's heart ached to see&#xD;
that she got no kindling gleam of gaiety in return, and she bit&#xD;
her lip impatiently as she watched the insouciant boy making the&#xD;
most of his time, after his happy-go-lucky fashion, bringing them&#xD;
all into his talk, and promoting mirth by his mirthful face, and&#xD;
she heartily wished that her :two children had never 'grie to Roar-&#xD;
ing River, nor seen the Goldsmiths.&#xD;
" That fellow will be carrying his good looks and nice speeches,&#xD;
that mean nothing, a long way off presently, and there'll be an&#xD;
end of that folly. Let him go to Italy 'and stay there. Poor&#xD;
Bertha! good child !' her first heart-ache, so early, too; and the&#xD;
dull, heavy, flavorless days that willtfollow' before this wears out.&#xD;
But it can't be 'helped; every girl has to go through it as she&#xD;
does through the whooping cough' and measles."&#xD;

CHAPTER -FO R TY-FOURTH.&#xD;
PAPA GROENVELDT BESTOWS SOME FLOWERS UPO nHIS&#xD;
DAUGHTERS.&#xD;
THE day's trials and triumphs were over and Chris stood with&#xD;
the scholarship in .her hand;. the prize she had toiled for, and&#xD;
dreamed of, and she wondered what had become of the exulting&#xD;
joy such dreams had promised her. She went through the con-&#xD;
gratulations with the same set,.joyless face, and passive manner&#xD;
she had worn all day. One trial more, and she could hide her-&#xD;
self from her kind like a wounded deer, that creeps away into&#xD;
the dense thicket to suffer alone.&#xD;
Though Otho had been so near that he had touched her band,&#xD;
he was oh ! so far away ! Not sympathy for her, not even pity&#xD;
had prompted his actions, only his sense of the fitness of things,&#xD;
and interest in the harmony of his mother's arrangements. He&#xD;
had spoken to her but the one word, " begin-;" not even the com-&#xD;
mon courtesies he offered to strangers--the pears at dinner, a&#xD;
glass of water-nothing; and her repentance and self-blame be-&#xD;
gan to give way to proud resentment and anger.. After all, she&#xD;
had committed no crime. The blood flushed up in her cheeks as&#xD;
she remembered her broken promise, her forgetfulness of his ex-&#xD;
pressed wishes.&#xD;
"He shall be troubled by no more of my short-conings ; he&#xD;
has taken hgis release, I will gladly confirm it."&#xD;
As she thus thought, she raised her head proudly, and smiling&#xD;
a bitter smile, she shut herself' into her room. She did not know&#xD;
that longing, hungry eyes were watching her, reading her moods&#xD;
as on a written page.&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLD SMITU'S D    GWI E.             G2~&#xD;
Her rejected dresses lay in a heap on the floor, her soiled&#xD;
apron in the chair, half a dozen books,.a slipper, an empty ink-&#xD;
stand, and some dried passion-flowers on the bed, and her armoire&#xD;
doors swinging. She blushed as deep- at the sight .as though&#xD;
Otho's eyes had been gazing also, and she put up her scholarship&#xD;
and set herself to bring order out of the chaos, laying aside&#xD;
each article with a resolution folded into it;' and when .ll was&#xD;
finished, she sat down to think, but she had small time for bring-&#xD;
ingther plans into shape, before the supper-bell rang. She got up&#xD;
and stood before her mirror, smoothed her hair, examined her&#xD;
collar, ruled all emotions out of her face, and quietly descended.&#xD;
At the door of the supper-room the  dear old Professor met her;&#xD;
and drew her hand within his arm, patting it softly, and placed&#xD;
her in her usual seat on his right. Otho came and sat-opposite,&#xD;
and Belle Brandon had the next place. Madame, from her end&#xD;
of the:table, thought what a handsome pair :they were ; what-an&#xD;
absolute contrast in coloring and expression.--the feinale so child-&#xD;
ishly bewitching, the male so proudly grave, and both so perfect;&#xD;
and again she wished that Belle would beg for her evening's&#xD;
pleasure, and wondered - at the impulsive, daring little creature's&#xD;
unclouded face under her disappointment.&#xD;
Chris took mechanically what was offered to her, and though&#xD;
her eyelids would quiver at sound of Otho's voice, she steadily&#xD;
turned away from him; he was no more anything to her,.and she&#xD;
was using all the force she was mistress of, to thrust him out of&#xD;
his place in her heart, to release: herself from  the bondage&#xD;
which was irksome to her, and go her joyless way unaided and&#xD;
alone.&#xD;
A' little glass jar of preserved ginger stood before the Profes-&#xD;
sor; he and Chris loved all sorts of foreign sweets, and :were&#xD;
accustomed to share them together, with kind words and sly fun;&#xD;
like two merry children. He placed a tempting saucer under Iher&#xD;
eyes, and touched her hand, and ma'det pantomime of eating&#xD;
with vast relish. She bowed, thought she smiled,' and sofight&#xD;
absently up and down for something she needed; itwas te&#xD;
.oon, but as none met her eyes, which happenedto rest on the&#xD;

&#xD;
caster, she concluded it to be: mustard and 'pepper which she&#xD;
lacked, so she drew it towards her, and having plastered her&#xD;
sweetmeats with mustard, she sprinkled them plentifully with pep-&#xD;
per. Belle burst into a:mocking laugh, touching Zambrano's arm&#xD;
and pointing out the preioceupiec1 girl, whose bent head- drooped&#xD;
under, her. disordered, unwelcome thoughts. She drew Otho's at-&#xD;
tention also from a conversation he was. laboriously sustaining,&#xD;
and Je' frowned angrily.&#xD;
"Roger!" said he, in an offended tone, "take that away and'&#xD;
bring a plate of broiled oysters."&#xD;
oger obeyed, and placing the" tempting bivalves before Chris,&#xD;
he took hold of her saucer ,to draw it gently away. Chris came&#xD;
to herself, and seeing-what she had done, she threw a shy, fright-&#xD;
ened glance around the table; .many eyes were fixed on her, and&#xD;
some were laughing at her.&#xD;
" Roger," said Chris; recalling the servant, with sparkling eyes,&#xD;
why !did you bring me these ?"&#xD;
"Mr.-Groenveldt ordered them, Miss Goldsmith," replied Roger,-&#xD;
raising his eyebrows apologetically.&#xD;
"Very well, give them to Mr. Groenveldt; when I desire any&#xD;
food I will ask you."&#xD;
Chris:threw herself back in her chair in angry silence.&#xD;
"So, so, Fraulein," said- the dear old Professor, patting her'&#xD;
hand under the table.        ,&#xD;
Chris turned her face toward him and smiled ; in none of her&#xD;
many changing moods, could she be sour to him.&#xD;
Otho was talking Germany with Max, and his reminiscences&#xD;
of the slangenbad must have been mirth provoking, for a queer&#xD;
smile'lighted his 'gravity, though he seemed oblivious of Chris;&#xD;
and her doings.&#xD;
"You ought to have a:taster, Mignone ; you'll poison yourself&#xD;
one of these fine days," said Belle.&#xD;
"Perhaps I may, but I wish you was as sure of dropping into&#xD;
your grave without poisoning somebody, as I am of steering clear&#xD;
'of what isn't good for me.".'&#xD;
Chris could not have told what impelled her to answer Belle&#xD;
&#xD;
630&#xD;
&#xD;
63 1&#xD;
&#xD;
thus, nor could 'Belle' have accounted for. the shudder which ran&#xD;
through her, and an odd thing happened to her, too.:, for one in-&#xD;
stant the present vanished, and as'if Chris's eyes;were a mirror,&#xD;
she saw herself in them; an:old; ugly, guilt-stained'hag, a pollu-&#xD;
ted creature. Perhaps -her guardian' angel showed her.the-vision,&#xD;
to save her from the ruin hertreachery and falsehood would-bring&#xD;
upon her; perhaps it foreshadowed the dreary end, 'who can say ?&#xD;
She shook herself restlessly, and ,tossed off :her curls,.and her&#xD;
Geraldine eyes sought those around her; ;it seemed -as if they&#xD;
must have seen the sight she saw, and it took a good look in the&#xD;
long mirror oppositeto reassure her.&#xD;
" Papa Groenveldt," spoke up Zoe, saucily, "'do you not intend&#xD;
to give your daughters some fresh - flowers, for our. party;? some&#xD;
scarlet for me, if: you please ; something purple for Sabrina, it&#xD;
might be heliotropes ; lilies or white rose buds for Bertha; a clas-&#xD;
sic wreath for Chris-"                     -&#xD;
"Chris loves pansies," broke in Belle ; " we all know what her&#xD;
pet flower is. She had them in her hair 'up at Craigenfells, at&#xD;
the fair ; she picks them out from the thousand ; no others are so&#xD;
precious to her, so full of thoughts, as pretty Ophelia says."&#xD;
Chris suffered under Belle's talk, and.she threw a swift look at&#xD;
Otho, and met his eyes fixed upon her with a steady, questioning&#xD;
glance, which made her drop hers upon her plate.&#xD;
" You shall have pomegranates, little gipsey; Sabrina-"&#xD;
" Sabrina," spoke up Chandy, interrupting, "'thou shalt not&#xD;
lack the flower that's like thy face ; pale primrose, nor the azured&#xD;
harebell, like thy eyes ; no, nor the leaf of eglantine which out-&#xD;
sweetest not thy breath."'&#xD;
" That'll do, Chandy," said Sam; "drop Milton."&#xD;
The Professor laughed and went on: "My good Bertha shall&#xD;
have tube-roses ; Dolores, -yellow jessamine; and I know Belle&#xD;
desires to have orange-flowers," (slyly.)&#xD;
In the laugh that followed, and the jokes which cut Belle rather&#xD;
close,Ihe turned to Chris, and said with fatherly fondness:&#xD;
" Is it pansies, Fraulein? now I do remember; you wear them&#xD;
at your throat, your press them between your book-leaves. It is&#xD;

lucky; Elwanger hs sent me some beauties, as large as a Spanish&#xD;
dollar, and as deeps'and rich a violet-as those lustrous orbs Dolo-&#xD;
res uses so well. You shall have them, Fraulein; I won't pull&#xD;
my flowers for everybody, but my pupil shall have them-my&#xD;
art scholar." He patted her hand with a wistful look, "Ah, if&#xD;
they could be to, thee heart's-ease, my daughter."&#xD;
She lifted thankful eyes to him, but she had hard work to be&#xD;
quiet, for she felt sure he must remember the bunch of pansies&#xD;
she had painted into the hat of her St.4Alexis.&#xD;
" It is so good to have a friend," said she, after a little. " You&#xD;
rest me, and it will not do for me to get over weary, will it? for&#xD;
I am going to dance to-night."  Again she looked at Otho, and&#xD;
again she met that questioning gaze.&#xD;
"Will you dance once with me, fraulein, von valtz ?"&#xD;
"Oh yes," answered she, smiling. "I shall set you spinning to&#xD;
a swift measure ; we'will be gay together."&#xD;
Tenderly the dear-old Professor put out his hand 'and touched&#xD;
hers, and this time he sighed deeply.-&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER FORTY-FIFTH.&#xD;
THE GREAT PARTY.&#xD;
ErHT o'clock was the hour at which the guests were to Fasw&#xD;
semble, and all the pupils were expected to be in the ball-room&#xD;
at that time. The half-hour had struck, and still Chris stood be-&#xD;
fore her mirror, her hands busy with her chestnut- hair, intent&#xD;
upon her work. She was, trying her skill once more upon a&#xD;
Sappho knot.&#xD;
" There!" said she at length, resting her tired arms and hold-&#xD;
ing up her little hand-glass to get the effect; "I think that is&#xD;
perfect. Ruthie herself, skillful little hair-dresser as she is, could&#xD;
not have done it better. None of Miss Brandon's tumble-down&#xD;
frouzes this time. Timon is indeed Timon's friend."  She threw&#xD;
her dress carefully over her head--the dainty muslin, Chandy's&#xD;
purchase-and arranged each airy fold, and tied her" sash with&#xD;
anxious care. A bunch of pansies lay on her dressing-table ; she&#xD;
stooped and inhaled their fragrance from time to time with a&#xD;
loving motion, which was a caress.&#xD;
"Dear old friend ! kind master ! faithful in adversity. I will&#xD;
wear your flowers gladly this once ; but I shall never wear them&#xD;
again. These thoughts and I must take leave of each other, and be&#xD;
strangers forevermore."  She separated them with tender gesture,&#xD;
and placed part in her hair as she had worn them -that evening&#xD;
when Otho called her "violet crowned,-sweetly smiling Sappho,"&#xD;
and arranged the rest in her breast-knot; looked again to the&#xD;
lacing of the white satin boots she had electrified madame by&#xD;
quietly ordering. She drew on her dainty Jouvin's, fitted and&#xD;

&#xD;
fastened them to a nicety, and then,. scanned herself--eagerly,&#xD;
anxiously.&#xD;
" Is there anything wanting which other girls would have whose&#xD;
souls are made of finery?  Let me be sure. Sabrina or Zoe&#xD;
would tell me, but I will not be told. I will know of my own&#xD;
knowledge. Since the neglect of my outward adornment is of&#xD;
consequence enough to turn, the true love of 'my lover to sour&#xD;
disdain, I will make it my study. Yes, in small detail, he shall&#xD;
see that I can shine in dress. It shall be a duty-a duty to my-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"Too late ! too late !" whispered her aching heart. "You&#xD;
have already lost him."&#xD;
"True," she replied to her heart. "And since I lost him.&#xD;
through this, it must be a terrible fault,: and I will amend it. I'll&#xD;
have no giant faults. 'It seems it is not enough to be true and&#xD;
pure a'nd honest, and even scholarly, but we must be well-dressed&#xD;
also. Therefore let us attend." She studied the reflection which&#xD;
her mirror gave her carefully, and a triumphant joy dashed into&#xD;
her face.&#xD;
"Christabel Goldsmith, my dear double ! you are a beauty !"&#xD;
she said, with the voice of a discoverer ; " and, Christabel Gold-&#xD;

me see them! Yes, very pretty, pointed, rosy-tipped fingers.&#xD;
C'handy praises them sometimes. Ah, Chandy-that makes me&#xD;
sad ; he has hurt me: Herd, stop ! You've a faint soupcon of&#xD;
ink on the middle digit; 'you must amend that. Now remember,&#xD;

has been done once can be done again; nay, it must, it shall-&#xD;
every day ; no shirking, no hurry, no carelessness."&#xD;
While still glancing curiously, almost wonderingly, at the rare&#xD;
picture-the earnest face, which threw back her intense look,.&#xD;
Sabrina knocked at the door. Chris, panting under a new emo-&#xD;
tion, and throwing a smiling kiss to her handsome acquaintance,&#xD;
took up her boquet and fan and opened it.&#xD;
Sabrina, could not repress an exclamation.  "How lovely !&#xD;

&#xD;
Why Chris, darling, what strange metamorphosis have you under-&#xD;
gone? You don't look the same at all !"&#xD;
Chris smiled a strange smile. " I've been asleep, I think, and&#xD;
am but just awakened."&#xD;
Queenly §abrina gazed a moment, and then flew at her and&#xD;
covered her neck and arms with kisses.&#xD;
" Precious sleeping beauty ! how thankful I am that. you are&#xD;
awake."&#xD;
" Let us go," answered Chris with feverish impatience.&#xD;
"Yes indeed, it is quite time for you to come.  Madame&#xD;
frowned dreadfully when she sent me up. The two first quadrilles&#xD;
are over already, besides a polka and galop."&#xD;
They entered the hall: a great lofty room with heavy oaken&#xD;
beams supporting the ceiling, and gathered together at the zenith&#xD;
by a vast carved center-piece of fruits and flowers, and the deep&#xD;
blue vault-was studded with golden stars, which glittered :in the&#xD;
blaze of the chandeliers. A narrow gallery-ran around the sides,&#xD;
filled with papas and mamas, who chose the lofty place for a view&#xD;
of their darlings, who were floating in white muslin or doing the&#xD;
amiable in black swallow-tails and white kids on the floor below&#xD;
them, each having eyes for the particular treasure, and consider-&#xD;
ing the rest of the fdte as accessory to him or her. Over the en-&#xD;
trance was a snug box for the band, who were playing a galop,&#xD;
and thirty couples or so were spinning around to the swift and&#xD;
rather romping measure, walled in by triple rows of palpitating&#xD;
young humanity, watching their swift twirls and eagerly panting&#xD;
to join them. Zoe Walsingham, brilliant as the tropical flowers&#xD;
she wore in her breast and drooping among her purple black&#xD;
braids, rested her little hand on stalwart Peter's shoulder, and&#xD;
chatted as she flew. - He danced as he farmed, in the best, most&#xD;
exact and perfect business manner, too much 'engrossed in the&#xD;
motion, and carefully keeping clear of the other dancers, (he'-hated&#xD;
bumping in a ball-room,) to answer her teazing; but he never&#xD;
forgot for an instant whose waist , he held. Every beat of his }&#xD;
great faithful heart was for her, every look he gave her was-fond,&#xD;
proud, truth; such joy and pride and love shown down at her as&#xD;

&#xD;
made her tremble sometimes when she met the glance, and very&#xD;
nearly turned the merry mocking on her lips into tender tears.&#xD;
Chandos, handsome as ever ,danced with Bertha, and talked to&#xD;
her, disobeying the dancing-master's instructions, "Keep your face&#xD;
to, the right, always to the right, gentlemen," and they moved&#xD;
easily, in swift curves, like birds flying. And Dolores! ah, I&#xD;
cannot decribe her dancing,.with Peebles for her partner. And&#xD;
the jar and the motion of the many feet set the lustres of the&#xD;
chandeliers tinkling like fairy bells.&#xD;
Sabrina and Chris paused near the door, where the full blaze&#xD;
from the hundred lights, poured its flood over them. It was well&#xD;
they were young and lovely, and could bear it. Many eyes&#xD;
rested upon Christabel in amazement. What, great cha'ige had&#xD;
passed upon her, as if to transfigure her. The habitually. bent&#xD;
shoulders and dropped gaze, absently seeking the carpet, were not&#xD;
there. She stood still and proud, her fine head thrown back, her&#xD;
great brown eyes lighted from within, and blazing like stars; her&#xD;
flexible lips compressed slightlyia brilliant scarlet glowed in her&#xD;
cheeks; her lovely shoulders. and arms, rounded and filled out in&#xD;
the artist life she had reveled in, showed fine and clear as satin,&#xD;
without an ornament; and her wondrous hair, in rippling masses,&#xD;
confined in .its classic knot, and crowned by the dear flowers she&#xD;
loved; her floating, vapory muslin fell in - soft folds around her&#xD;
slender shape like a fleecy cloud, dropping softly down beside the&#xD;
violet mist which enveloped-Sabrina. They were not suffered to&#xD;
stand long alone. Max touched Otho's arm.,&#xD;
"Is not that the heroine of ' Conflicts,' the winner of many&#xD;
prizes, the marvelous chantress who sat opposite at supper, in a&#xD;
grey dress, as quiet and demure as a wood-pigeon ? I could'nt&#xD;
keep my eyes off her; , and judge of my surprise at finding her&#xD;
afterwards in the studio, (where I looked in, searching for, you,)&#xD;
speaking an unknown tongue with Herr Groenveldt. . They were&#xD;
adoring a Saint, I believe ; at. all events there was one on the&#xD;
easel before them, and they looked serious enough for worship,"&#xD;
"You mean Miss Goldsmith, I suppose," said Otho coldly.&#xD;
" So she is named among mortals, I am told ; the celestials may&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
call her otherwise. She has no touch of earthliness about her&#xD;
to-night.  She's beautiful! glorious!  Has she come, here to&#xD;
-dance, think you? Would it be presumption to ask her?"&#xD;
"I-suppose young ladies mostly oome into a ball-room to&#xD;
dance," replied Otho drily, "if they have partners."&#xD;
"But I am modest, fearful; does-she-look propitious?  Would&#xD;
she be gracious ?"&#xD;
"I haven't seen her," replied Otho, looking perversely the&#xD;
wrong way.&#xD;
'"Neither will you if you stare over there, unless you have&#xD;
eyes in the back of your head. Here, under the first chandelier.&#xD;
I did not know you were short-sighted;, you used to have an eye&#xD;
like a.hawk. *Here ! take my glass."&#xD;
"KThanks."  Otho pushed-the. glass aside, and said dryly, "I&#xD;
have only lately discovered my misfortune; but I- think that is&#xD;
. -Miss Goldsmith-and Miss Bradshaw."&#xD;
"Why ! what an unenthusiastic clod you are, Otho.- You an-&#xD;
nounce the fact as coolly as if you were among your dry bones ;&#xD;
no fire, no passion, cool as , an anchorite. But I remember you&#xD;
always used to turn up your nose at the beauties the- rest of'us&#xD;
went mad over. Poor fellow ! I pity you; you have no idea how&#xD;
much you lose. But you shall be useful and -present me, at any&#xD;
rate. I can appreciate female loveliness ; I can adore beauty.&#xD;
I'm thankful for it."  He put his hand upon Otho's arm, who&#xD;
drew haughtily back.&#xD;
"Excuse me, Max, I cannot trespass upon Sam's duties; here&#xD;
he comes, baton and all."&#xD;
" Oh yes," answered Max, hooking on to Sam at once; who was&#xD;
speeding in the direction of the two as if afraid: of losing his&#xD;
chance.&#xD;
"Oh, the one in white," said the usher, relaxing an incipient&#xD;
frown which was- beginning to contract his brows; "certainly,&#xD;
with pleasure."  And the presentation being accomplished, Chris&#xD;
bowed eagerly and took the offered arm, whi e Sam rand Sabrina&#xD;
hurried off to seek Zoe, and secure her and Peter, Dolores and&#xD;
Chandy, for sides to the Parisienne, which was the next quadrille.&#xD;

".Shall we. take a turn with the dancers, Miss Goldsmith ?"&#xD;
asked Max, fixing his leonine eyes on his partner with undisguised&#xD;
admiration..&#xD;
"Oh y      she answered hurriedly; "I've lost so many al-&#xD;
ready."&#xD;
Max smiled at her odd manner. "Then we won't waste pre-&#xD;
cious time," said he, and they went floating down the hall. They&#xD;
passed so close to Otho that he caught the faint perfume of the pan-&#xD;
sies in her hair; Chris felt his presence, knew that he was study-&#xD;
ing her, though she did not raise her eyes. She drew her breath&#xD;
quickly, and waltzed on, answering her partner's murmured talk&#xD;
with gay replies, moving as if her whole soul was absorbed in the&#xD;
dance. In the next revolution they made, she smiled brightly as&#xD;
she neared the place where Otho stood, and had a little speech&#xD;
all ready ; she meant it should be careless and light, but he was&#xD;
not'there, and a pang clutched .her heart when she saw Belle&#xD;
Brandon's bead on his shoulder, and she almost lying in his arms.&#xD;
Belle's dancing was perhaps too voluptuous for an American girl,&#xD;
more like that of those eastern beauties who are slaves. As the&#xD;
blonde. fastened her steely eyes upon Chris, the poor girl faltered,&#xD;
and Max led her to aseat near the window, and stood talking with&#xD;
her, seeing but her in the vast hall.&#xD;
He was a great stout tall fellow, with massive head and yellow&#xD;
hair, and moustache, and long, silky beard, which had never been&#xD;
shaven-as unlike Otho as possible; but Chris knew him well, so&#xD;
much had she heard of him, his student life, his songs, his music,,&#xD;
and the foot-tramps the two friends had made together. His&#xD;
friendliness was pleasant to her, and his talk interested her, so&#xD;
lonely and cast out from love as she felt, and she listened and re-&#xD;
plied gratefully.&#xD;
Let us go back a little. Belle Brandon had been busy in her&#xD;
room; now she opened her door, and the distant music sounded-in&#xD;
her ears.. She walked swiftly across the corridor to Mary Ann.&#xD;
Williams' apartment, which she entered without the ceremony of&#xD;
knocking.&#xD;
The foil was sitting crouching' over the fire, her great blanket&#xD;
&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
WIDOW GOLDSMITHU'S DAUGHTER..           639&#xD;
shawl about her shoulders, and her, half-shut eyes busy among&#xD;
the embers. She turned slowly around, as if accustomed to intru-&#xD;
sion, and too listless and unhappy to question it. Her heavy&#xD;
face was swollen, and brick-color, and her eyes discolored with&#xD;
weeping.&#xD;
" Eh, prisoner with the chill-on, how are you enjoying your re-&#xD;
tirement ? making pious use of: it, I see," glancing contemptuously&#xD;
at the open Bible on the table. "How very proper ! madame&#xD;
ought to come up now ; she would relent at once before the sight&#xD;
of so much virtue."&#xD;
I wish you would shut the door; you bring in all the cold&#xD;
there is outside, just as if you wa's made of ice. My head aches;&#xD;
what do you .want ?"&#xD;
Belle flapped the door viciously three or four times before shut-&#xD;
ting it.&#xD;
"I've come for your new   muslin, dear; as you can't go to&#xD;
the party I'll just wear it for you. I shall only need the skirt.&#xD;
I've split out that other trumpery so that there's. nothing left of&#xD;
the waist worth speaking of. I didn't think of yours, or I wouldn't&#xD;
have bothered'myself."&#xD;
She walked to the armoire, and took down the. dress without&#xD;
waiting for a reply ; so used was Mary Ann to such inroads and&#xD;
exactions, that she scarcely thought of resistance. Belle held up&#xD;
the skirt before her; it was. elaborately made up of puffs and in-&#xD;
sertion, very showy and handsome.&#xD;
"I hope it is long enough ; only a demi-train ! Your mother is&#xD;
so stingy."&#xD;
" Has madame given you leave to go down to the party and&#xD;
left me shut up here ? how mean of her !"&#xD;
"I'm going to take leave, my dear."&#xD;
"You dassen't go without permission; you ain't telling the&#xD;
truth."&#xD;
"What I dare not do remains to be shown to me ; but don't&#xD;
agitate yourself, my dear ; 'tis all the same to you either way,&#xD;
because you would have no dress to wear even if you had the&#xD;
most gracious permission. Good night, my pious child; read&#xD;

fellows. Pity-Cabby isn't here ; then wouldn't your imprisonment&#xD;
be a penance ?"&#xD;
She was going off without another look at the crouching figure,&#xD;
but Mary Ann sat up and said:&#xD;
" Don't go yet, Belle; I want to tell you my dream."&#xD;
"As if I should stay' for that!"' answered Belle, with scorn.&#xD;
" You shall, then !"  She got up and seized her tyrant's dress&#xD;
and held her fast, and spoke rapidly.&#xD;
" I dreamed that I-was dead, and I saw the awful lake of fire&#xD;
and brimstone, where the smoke of their torment ascendeth for-&#xD;
ever and ever; and the horrid creatures with burning eyes were&#xD;
swimming and writhing about in it, howling and cursing, and&#xD;
I shuddered and, tried to get away up the steep edge of the pit&#xD;
that scorched my hands, but you. was behind me, and pushed me&#xD;
in among the, hideous, dreadful things, and the smoke went up&#xD;
and choked me, and the snakes crawled over me, and you laughed&#xD;
so loud that I awoke, and ,the sweat stood all over me.- Don't go-&#xD;
there to-night, Belle; stay with me; you deserve as much as I.&#xD;
I wonder if there is any such place as father talksabout in meet-&#xD;
ing, and the minister preaches. 'If there is, I'm bad=enough to&#xD;
go to it, and it's all along of you. - You shan't leave me alone;&#xD;
I'm afraid of the stillness; it is full of hateful things. I won't&#xD;
go -to bed. They say the world is coming to an end this year ; if&#xD;
it does, I shall be damned."&#xD;
She dropped down into a, chair,,and covered her face in her&#xD;
shawl and sobbed drearily.&#xD;
Belle twitched awr her dress from the girl's limp grasp, and&#xD;
looked over her shoulder at the crouching figure, and felt the most&#xD;
intense disgust and wonder; she did not understand any such&#xD;
state of mind.s&#xD;
"Well you are a precious piece of goods !" she sneered. "My&#xD;
own Mary Ann, take my advice, seek your- couch, and dream&#xD;
once more, and try if you 'can't get a glimpse of heaven next&#xD;
time. It's just as easy, and vastly more agreeable ; only you'&#xD;
need not trouble yourself to bring me into the same mansion with&#xD;

accommodations. You gorged yourself with those Dutch dump-&#xD;
lings at dinner, I know as well As if I had seen you. You are&#xD;
always a gross feeder, and the inferno is of your own creation."&#xD;
Belle was delicate and dainty in appetite, and habitually dis-&#xD;
gusted with MaryAnn's gobbling propensities.&#xD;
"As for staying, you forget:that I am forbidden to communicate&#xD;
with you."&#xD;
She ,shut the. door, and walked away, smiling to herself at the&#xD;
curious folly her foil was developing.&#xD;
" So much for education.  Let me be thankful that there is no&#xD;
hell in my creed, nor heaven either. This' round world is all-I&#xD;
know or care about. One of the earliest of my recollections was&#xD;
my uncle's fuu over all such superstitions. Spiritualism suits me&#xD;
very well; 'the summer land, the seven spheres.' I mean to' be&#xD;
a medium when I get time. Now I must hurry to the ball-room&#xD;
and pick out my affinity."&#xD;
Shut up in her -apartment, she worked nimbly, and was soon&#xD;
dressed.' Her dress was not what she would have liked, but she&#xD;
knew that it became. her well. . A  velvet bodice, with long laced&#xD;
points, like those in the old pictures. Deborah's rich lace, ruth-&#xD;
lessly snipped asunder, fell over her plump, -deeamy arms, and&#xD;
adorned her rare neck and shoulders. The cape, jessamines she&#xD;
wore in her curls and breast-knot, she had become surreptitiously&#xD;
possessed=of while the gardener's back was turned ; and she tossed&#xD;
aside the .orange flowers which the d ar old Professor had sent&#xD;
her as a:sly joke.&#xD;
"The time has not come for those yet," said she; "everything&#xD;
in its season."&#xD;
She clasped on the pearls, and after studying her dimples, flah-&#xD;
ing her glances, and practicing her voluptuous figure"in a graceful&#xD;
bend or two before her mirror, as a prize-fighter trieshis muscle be-&#xD;
fore entering the ring, she sailed into the ball-room withas assured&#xD;
a grace and as much quiet self-possession :as:if she were the hon-&#xD;
ored guest instead of a culprit under sentence of imprisonment.&#xD;

- There was not the .show of audacious daring on her beautiful face&#xD;
,.one might have looked to see under the circumstances, but perfect&#xD;
ease and joyous abandon-the: girlish pleasure which innocent&#xD;
maidens take in fetes. She threaded her way up to Otho.&#xD;
"One little galop, will it' please you, sir ?" said she,:as a child&#xD;
begs grandpa for a sugar plum.&#xD;
She did not in the least mind the cold, haughty manner of his&#xD;
acceding to her request; she did .not.wishto dance 'with him for&#xD;
love of him, and his feelings were of little consequence ; and so&#xD;
she met Chris, and showed herself to'her, -and saw' her suffering,&#xD;
and laughed merrily as she floated past her.       '&#xD;
Chris had plenty of: partners, plenty of admiration; her ball&#xD;
book was full in no time, and many stood' aboat'her in the pauses&#xD;
of the dance, and. courted her smiles, and .listened to her Words.&#xD;
The wall-flowers talked her over, after the habit of wall-flowers,&#xD;
and pronounced her a flirt, without the' least claim to :beauty, all'&#xD;
airs, &amp;amp;c. The papas and mammas whose daughters were not&#xD;
belles, wagged their heads solemnly over ter bold ways; they&#xD;
wagged harder when Judge 'Sistaire, who was not a:dancing man,&#xD;
took her on his arm and promenaded up and down the hall; 'and&#xD;
the scraps, of talk they could _ catch proved that the' two had got&#xD;
among the Druids. Max. came again' and again, and Chris&#xD;
seemed more interesting among,'the talkers 'than the dancers.&#xD;
Otho, after getting rid of Belle, mingled as little as might be&#xD;
with the dancers; .but .he watched Chris whenever she moved';'&#xD;
and he bit his lip and frowned at his friend Max who pursued his&#xD;
acquaintance with' such absorbed eagerness. His fresh  German&#xD;
ways, dashed sometimes with a painful thought 'or troublesome&#xD;
memory, were very' fascinating, and' no wonder Chris gave hime&#xD;
all her attention: any girl might be proud of the homage of such&#xD;
a man.&#xD;
Though Mr. Oth6 looked as calm as a rock, his dark cheek&#xD;
flushed somewhat when Chris rose from her place in the window,&#xD;
and bowing to Max, as if declining his attendance, came slowly,&#xD;
-towards him alone, and his pulse beat hammer-strokes when  he&#xD;
.paused in front of him and curtsied deeply&#xD;

She looked quietly in his face, as if she were asking.for a pen-&#xD;
cil, and with her ,hands folded over her boquet. of pansies, she&#xD;
awaited his reply. He felt very angry that. she should thus break&#xD;
down the wall he had chosen to build between them, and so coolly&#xD;
accost him, without a tremble in her voice, or the trace of a pang&#xD;
in her mobile face.&#xD;
" Do you desire it, Miss Goldsmith ?"&#xD;
Though.she winced a little at the strange name he gave her,&#xD;
she replied:' '        '&#xD;

which-I might have better employed, and I don't wish it lost,&#xD;
though I regard dancing as the next silliest way of spending time&#xD;
to cards; I cannot account for the' infatuation people show for&#xD;
either folly."&#xD;
Otho felt the hit-he prided himself upon his whist-playing.&#xD;
"It were a pity you should be out of pocket by any suggestion&#xD;
of mine.: You are aware, I suppose, that no one else knows the&#xD;
dance."&#xD;
"Perfectly; you desired me to keep .my lessons a secret, and&#xD;
I have faithfully obeyed you, and have practiced your steps in&#xD;
the solitude of my apartment, with locked doors."&#xD;
"'Perhaps you would rather not be conspicuous.?"&#xD;
Chris curled her lip scornfully. ".My objections on that score&#xD;
were ruled out as idle whims- when I took the lessons, and I'do&#xD;
not choose to dig them up now. The steps are to waltz music,&#xD;
'and the rest of the dancers are' too much .engrossed with' their&#xD;
own performances to trouble themselves about me. When I 'have&#xD;
kept my word I shall forget it as fast as' Ii can, and shall certainly&#xD;
never dance it again. '-I am ready, sir, at your earliestrpleasure;&#xD;

Otho knew as well as she that she was testing her power over&#xD;
herself, and showing it to him.&#xD;
"If you will take my arm  I will speak to the M. C., unless&#xD;
you prefer remaining here alone till I return. I see that you&#xD;
have not the young-ladyish dread of walking alone."&#xD;
"I will go with you," she replied, ignoring the cruel ending of&#xD;
his speech ; and placed the=tips of her fingers upon his coat-sleeve,&#xD;
and they walked down the hall together.&#xD;
The Roating River girls touched each other as she passed them,&#xD;
and all the five hundred scholars, who knew her story perfectly,&#xD;
how she had been openly disdained -by the man she loved, and&#xD;
treated with cool neglect, not to say contempt ; how he had not&#xD;
spoken one word to her since he came, and all the rest-whis--&#xD;
pered and wondered to see her leaning on his arm.. She 'spoke&#xD;
to her acquaintances on either hand, and answered-their talk with&#xD;
apt replies, delivered in clear ringing tones, and a bright, uncloud-&#xD;
ed face.&#xD;
Otho glanced at her more than once, and -after a gay speech of&#xD;
hers to Sari, who 'was still constant to Sabrina, (and honest Sam&#xD;
always looked at his partner as if he saw heaven in her eyes,) he&#xD;
took her hand in his and brought it -firmly withinhis arm, , and&#xD;
straightened himself in his proud, masterful way. She seemed&#xD;
not to observe the action, but suffered her =fingers to drop where&#xD;
le placed them,'indifferently.&#xD;
He walked twice around the great hall before he approached&#xD;
the music stall. Though she only answered politely when he&#xD;
addressed her,'and looked carelessly in his face' as she did so, he&#xD;
felt's'ure of'her love-that 'she could never 'resist- him when he&#xD;
chose: to'e persuasive and tender,; and through 'all the pleasure,&#xD;
she took in having her near him; he; still keenly felt the disappoint-&#xD;
ment and tnbrtification she had forced upon him.&#xD;
The band struck up one ,of- Chopin's,'delicious waltzes, which&#xD;
melts and mrmurs,:and glides, andswells in such bewitching&#xD;

these wreathed melodies of Chopin's were a memory of her dear&#xD;
love, sweet and precious, but dead now, buried out of her sight.&#xD;
Her partner turned and touched her waist with-his fingers, and as&#xD;
she dropped her hand upon his shoulder, his dark intense eyes,&#xD;
brimming with'power, demanded love from her melting brown ones,&#xD;
but she ruled hers so well that they'spoke only attention to the&#xD;
waltz.&#xD;
They turned and whirled to the smooth harmonies,'they floated&#xD;
past the other moving figures, but she saw nobody ; she was danc-&#xD;
ing with her lover for the last time; he held her hand, he would&#xD;
never touch it again. Even now his heart was cold toward her-&#xD;
bitter, unkind; he had said,. "nothing shall ever part. us ; IL.will&#xD;
be your shield from all the world," and they were as far asunder&#xD;
as the poles; for a fault which was not a crime he had turned his&#xD;
back upon her.&#xD;
But her calmness could not last-it must break up ; the shad-&#xD;
ow of her great grief would settle down upon her face, hereyes&#xD;
would get humid, and her breath come with a-sob. Unconsciously&#xD;
'she tightened her, grasp upon his fingers, and the steady time-beat&#xD;
of the dancers, the ripple-marked music, faded in her ears. He&#xD;
saw and understood it; he felt the finger-elasp in every nerve,&#xD;
but he would not pity her. " She would show me her strength ;&#xD;
let her feel that it is but'weakness."&#xD;
Even while he so. thought and studied her, she was rallying&#xD;
her great woman's endurance once for all. A moment more and&#xD;
she could leave him ; she must bow and smile, and then it would&#xD;
be, over, and she would be alone. She steadied her step and held&#xD;
her lips firmly pressed together ; a dozen more airy gyrals brought&#xD;
them to the door of one of the dressing-rooms ; she obeyed Otho's&#xD;
light" gesture and stopped, self-poised, erect, with shining, still&#xD;
eyes, took the arm he offered, and-walked by his side a couple of&#xD;
steps within the deserted room,:hung about with cloaks and hoods.&#xD;
She, knew that he wished to speak to her, to ,give back  her&#xD;
troth and take his freedom;:and she waited till he should begin,&#xD;
and wondered how he would say it.&#xD;

"Chris,-my darling ! Sappho, my wife," he mastered his voice&#xD;
with difficulty; but looked proud, almost stern,:and certain of his&#xD;
'hold upon her. "All that has come and gone shall be as nothing,&#xD;
less than nothing. I want you, I must have you. Nothing shall&#xD;
separate us. , You are mine.. I will keep you forever."&#xD;
She withdrew' her hand from his arm and 'forced herself to&#xD;
stand cool and quiet beneath the fire of his glance, and the pas=&#xD;
siolate sweetness of his voice which she'loved better than all&#xD;
music.-- He ptned his arms and 'said, " come my jewel, my&#xD;
pearl. I found you. I have a finder's right to you. I will wear&#xD;
you in my heart, this is your home, here upon my breast.".&#xD;
She glided Iaway from him in the'moonlight, still and white&#xD;
and the 'quivaring beams played over her face. She-pressed both&#xD;
her hands uppn her heart, and moistened her parched lips be-&#xD;
fore she spolre. He frowned uneasily, and caught at the empty&#xD;
air with his outstretched hands, as if life were slipping away from&#xD;
'him.'&#xD;
"You mistake strangely, Mr. Groenveldt," said she in a vi-&#xD;
brating voice. "You mistakee strangely, sir, I belong only to&#xD;
myself."&#xD;
" What!" You cannot be so mad,,so wicked as to forget your&#xD;
:plighted troth." '&#xD;
"I forget nothing, sir. I have just fulfilled one promise I made&#xD;
you. I now hasten to keep another. I told you that when the&#xD;
time came that-I did not satisfy you, I would withdraw from you.&#xD;
INow I- rejoice to -set you'free. You cannot feel 'more keenly, or&#xD;
bewail more bitterly than I do the faults you find in me-the hab-&#xD;
its which are so very distasteful to you. I shall not pain you with&#xD;
them any more, because henceforth what I do or leave undone is&#xD;
nothing to 'you.. lloved and trusted you, and hoped to ,make&#xD;
you happy. You turned your back upon me in the presence of&#xD;
many, and left me alone a mark for pointing fingers, and scornful&#xD;
glances, and sharpened jests. You 'sanctioned them by your con-&#xD;
duct. If I -had. been guilty of a crime, you could'nt have treated&#xD;
me worse, and yet my life is clear and pure and my heart is lov-&#xD;
&#xD;
ing. You would not even give me a friendly greeting in those.&#xD;
hours we have passed under the same roof, sat at the same table."&#xD;
" Stop Christabel, you wrong me there. I sought you and&#xD;
could not find you. I wrote and got no reply. You know that&#xD;
I am a proud man, ard havewhims; had I not a right to expect&#xD;
you to regard my wishes, to keep your word with me ?"&#xD;
She .waived her ha d.. "I cannot change the past, nor can you.&#xD;
Be assured:I will never marry a man in whose eyes:I have read -&#xD;
disgust, abhorrence.. That I have deserved it makes it no easier&#xD;
to bear. Your pride shall suffer no more at my hands. Your.&#xD;
fastidious taste no further outrage. What promises I make here-&#xD;
after ;will concern -only myself, and I shall try to keep them.&#xD;
Your mother has been. at no pains to conceal' her dislike to me.&#xD;
She has been hard and cruel and unkind, and as good as told me&#xD;
many-times that I was not fit to be her daughter. I did not care&#xD;
so long as I-believed in you, but that foolish dream is over now.&#xD;
I see that any one'of these proper misses would suit you better&#xD;
than 'I. I desire to live hereafter to myself. -I shall have strength&#xD;
given me to take up the duties that lie before me. One such ex-&#xD;
perience will suffice. I do not want, I will not have the love of&#xD;
any man.&#xD;
. He stepped proudly 'towards 'her, with a haughty smile on his&#xD;
lips, and took both- her hands..in alfirm clasp.&#xD;
"You cannot- leave me thus,K Sappho. Indeed you shall not.:&#xD;
You overrate your power. You have tested it and came 'near.&#xD;
breaking down. You cannot exist in the outside world, alone.&#xD;
You will faint and droop and grow chilly and sad. You need love'&#xD;
as the cactus does sunshine. -You cannot unfold' or blossom.&#xD;
You cannot use your powers without it. You must haveta. true&#xD;
heart to sympathize with yours, a strong arm to support'you.&#xD;
Besides, you are mine. You are promised, and such troth is not'&#xD;
to be broken like a spider's web. I am your rightful lord. 'I&#xD;
sit throned in your heart of hearts." . He smiled significantly, and&#xD;
laid his hand upon her shining hair with caressing touch. "This&#xD;
witnesses for me, Sappho. ;I was in your thoughts when you&#xD;
twisted these lustrous coils, and the echo of my remembered words&#xD;

lingered in your ears when you knotted these bands of }rippling&#xD;
satin, violet crowned. You have my flowers on your breast. You&#xD;
inhale their sweetness,; they tell .you I love .you. They should&#xD;
tell you that I kissed them because I knew you would touch them&#xD;
with your lips. It is unjust for you to steel yourself against me&#xD;
because of my displeasure. I had a right to be displeased. A&#xD;
word of apology from you would have set all straight. You with-&#xD;
drew in angry silence ; but that-is past. Such a trifle shall not&#xD;
separate us. I will remind you of it no more. I claim my right.&#xD;
Tmam a suitor to you. I beg for your hand.".&#xD;
Chris looked at him. A proud suitor he seemed, with that&#xD;
firm haughty mouth, and masterful determined carriage, yet when&#xD;
her eyes met his, a beam of love shot forth, and an ineffable smile&#xD;
stole over his face. Chris new that there was power in his man-&#xD;
hood, and the steady firm strength she needed, but still she would&#xD;
not yield. She was proud too. She had but to throw herself&#xD;
upon his breast, and find rest and shelter. But she had not tried&#xD;
her resolutions; after so many slips she -might slip again, and the'&#xD;
mention of his displeasure, his right to be displeased, roused angry&#xD;
thoughts. "He. wants a slave, I will not be his slave. I dare&#xD;
not risk it. I should ruin his life, as well as my own." He knew&#xD;
well how thorough his empire over her would be if she but yielded.&#xD;
Her being must be but a.reflection of his.. With crimson cheeks&#xD;
and hasty gesture she pulled the flowers from her breast and hair&#xD;
and threw them on the ground.&#xD;
" Sappho !" he exclaimed, and his voice vibrated, it thrilled&#xD;
her, she drew away her hands..&#xD;
"I am as far removed from you as though I had already taken&#xD;
the.L ucadian leap.' I have just reminded you that my promise&#xD;
to you was conditional. You are showing me by every word you&#xD;
utter, that I cannot keep it. You vaunt your power over me.&#xD;
You believe it absolute, and yet you see I am about to leave you.&#xD;
Adieu, Mr.r Groenveldt, my partner waits for me."-&#xD;
She passed out of his sight, and he heard her clear soft voice&#xD;
in conversation with his' friend Max, as quiet as though she had&#xD;
not just now shut him out of her -soul, barred the gates against&#xD;

hin, and left him in outer darl'kness.  He walked like one in a&#xD;
dream down the hall out at the door. On the stairs he met his&#xD;
mother, who laid her hand upon his arm, thinking to do him&#xD;
pleasure.&#xD;
"Christabel Goldsmith is charming to-night-if one might only&#xD;
always be sure of seeing her thus. , Perhaps you are right, my&#xD;
son, after all. Love is mighty."&#xD;
"Do not give yourself further trouble, my mother, about her&#xD;
or me. Your wishes are accomplished. I am a free man. -Miss&#xD;
Goldsmith has just rejected me. I am a subject for your~congrat-&#xD;
ulations."  He passed down the stair-case, and left her gazing&#xD;
after him with curiously mingled emotions. Pity, grief, anger,&#xD;
joy.. -Her proud boy was her own again.&#xD;
Belle knew perfectly well that she would be made to pay&#xD;
dearly for her disobedience, but she recklessly resolved to enjoy&#xD;
her pleasure to the utmost. She danced and flirted; and sur-&#xD;
rounded herself with admirers. She had been in the hall an hour&#xD;
'md was beginning to wonder why she did not see madame any-&#xD;
where, whom she expected to. encounter long before, as on a bat-&#xD;
tle-field, when she felt her arm seized in a firm grasp, and knew&#xD;
instantly in whose hands she was. She whirled about, her face&#xD;
cloudless, and threw an artless dimpled smile right into madame's&#xD;
stern countenance.&#xD;
"Is it possible that you have dared to leave your room without&#xD;
permission ?"&#xD;
" Oh. yes! I really could not stay, it was so dull, and do you&#xD;
know I could hear the music so plainly. Every waltz, and galop,&#xD;
and I got nearly frantic over it. I love gaity so much. I de-&#xD;
cided to come down and felt better directly, so I threw on my&#xD;
dress, and here I am. A charming party is it not, madame?. I&#xD;
am enjoying it so much."&#xD;
" Come away instantly, "commanded madame's threatening&#xD;
voice."&#xD;
",Oh!, you wish to speak to me," said Belle ,blandly. "Mr.&#xD;
Zambrano will excuse me just' a moment, but. in pitydon't keep&#xD;

She bowed gaily to her partner, and putting her arm within&#xD;
that of her angry judge, she led her, instead of being led, into&#xD;
the cloak room, and shutting the door, she set her back against&#xD;
it.&#xD;
" Now I am ready for your lecture, Madame Groenveldt."&#xD;
She arranged Deborah's lace as she spoke, and admired her arms.&#xD;
" You must return instantly to your apartment, Miss Brandon.&#xD;
I am seriously displeased ; there is heavy reckoning in store for&#xD;
you."&#xD;
"Ah ! indeed ! you quite surprise me; but do you know, I shall&#xD;
have to decline to obey you. I am determined to have 'my fete.&#xD;
I shall not leave the hall unless I am carried out. If you attempt&#xD;
to force me, I'll scream and howl, and make such a scene as will&#xD;
effectually spoil your christmas party, which has cost so much&#xD;
money and trouble, and is such a charming success. I know how&#xD;
to keep my word so as to give your school a name, which would&#xD;
be unpleasant and unprofitable. You had better leave me alone.&#xD;
Where's the use of making a coil about such a trifle ?"&#xD;
"Trifle ! Do you count disobedience a trifle ?  Miss Williams&#xD;
has been with me. I am acquainted with the whole of your&#xD;
wicked conduct. Your selfishness, and shocking, dreadful untruths.&#xD;
Yes, Miss Brandon, she has told me the whole.'&#xD;
"Indeed ! I wish you joy of the knowledge I am sure. It&#xD;
must be quite 'an acquisition to your repertoire of curious facts,&#xD;
and dear Mary Ann, I left her sadly in the doldrums.. I dare say,&#xD;
she is more cheerful now that she has got rid of her tale. You&#xD;
found her charming company I'll engage."&#xD;
" Miss Brandon !"' said madame, gazing at her in sorrowful as-&#xD;
tonishment, " what are you made of ?"&#xD;
" Very nice flesh, and pure rich blood, see !"  Belle held up&#xD;
her beautiful arm before madame. "I've been studying physiol-&#xD;
ogy, but have'nt time to go into detail."&#xD;
" Go to your room, shameless girl."&#xD;
" No madame, I cannot oblige you thus far, I've given you my-&#xD;
reasons. I consider them good ones. Of course I shall be sent&#xD;
home, but I assure-you I shan't mind that in the least. I'm heart-&#xD;

me out into society.. She'll have to do it as her only chanced to&#xD;
get rid of me, and I'll not take up with any old Soapfut either.&#xD;
My aunt hates me because I am young and handsome ; old women&#xD;
always hate young ones, you know, Madame, and I am an ex=&#xD;
pense and a burden."&#xD;
"I shall expel you publicly," said madame, with crushing dig-&#xD;
nity.&#xD;
" As you please about that. I would'nt if I were you. The&#xD;
eclat of such a thing'-won't add any to the reputation of your&#xD;
school. Parents would be shy of placing their tender darlings&#xD;
where such a wolf had been. There might be more of the. same&#xD;
breed you know, so all your virtuous indignation wouldbe lastedd,&#xD;
besides being exceedingly unprofitable. You had better let me&#xD;
go quietly without any fuss. It won't matter much to me either&#xD;
way, because I shall forget all about this little out of the way&#xD;
corner as soon as I turn my back upon it; and take my proper&#xD;
place in the world."      -&#xD;
" Such dreadful wickedness under such a mask !" ejaculated&#xD;
madame, surprised out of herself, by Belle's audacious coolness.&#xD;
"Curious study, isn't it ? You will believe more' strongly in&#xD;
total depravity than ever, won't you? There is nothing in the&#xD;
doctrine, however. If you bring me to book; I'll deny everything.&#xD;
You' have. no proof against me, and I'll throw the whole' upon&#xD;
Mary Ann Williams. If she is senthome in disgrace, her mother&#xD;
will make the. place an inferno to her, and serve herright:for being&#xD;
such a ca't's-paw. She's half frightened to death now by her's-&#xD;
perstition, which she calls 'conviction of sin.' Poor fool! The&#xD;
moments are passing, Madame, I advise you to think over what I&#xD;
have said. Of course I can't hinder your tadung your own course;&#xD;
but I have advised you, and since I am to pay dearly for my&#xD;

thoroughly thunderstruck to recall -her, and she took her place in&#xD;
the set,:withradiant cormposure beautiful to behold.&#xD;
Many times in the evening Chris had found herself" near to&#xD;
Chandy in the pauses of the dancing, and upon each s tch meet-&#xD;
ing, a troubled cloud fell over his careless gaiety while he studied&#xD;
her face. Once he seized her. hands as if about to question her,&#xD;
but was interrupted before his intention found voice. After a&#xD;
quadrille, when he had been opposite to her, he drew her away&#xD;
into a corner.&#xD;
"!Chris, you are :unhappy ! all this brilliant talk does not de-&#xD;
ceive me.. Your firm lips say, 'I will not betray my trouble,' but&#xD;
your eyes are all the while ready to brim over, and they ask for&#xD;
sympathy in spite of you. Have any of the fellows dared to&#xD;
trample on your little felinks ? Just name them, and by the&#xD;
Sabre de mon Pere, I'll have coffee and pistols across the table."&#xD;
Chris had battled so successfully with her emotions, that anger&#xD;
against this happy-go-lucky fellow had no longer any place among&#xD;
them. She tried to consider the caricature a good, well-meant&#xD;
joke, " rather hard," she thought, smiling grimly at him while he&#xD;
talked.&#xD;
"I think I thank you, Chandos; indeed, Iam sure I do. The&#xD;
lesson was a bitter one;. but I dare say nothing less would have&#xD;
answered, I was so nearly incorrigible. It was hard but honest,&#xD;
as you are so fond of saying. Horrible slang ! I wish you would&#xD;
not use it.: You kindly meant to give me a rouser, which should&#xD;
so effectually break up my trance that I should never fall asleep&#xD;
again. Look at me ! I am fully awake, am I not? Examine&#xD;
my dress ! i there a pin wanting ? Look at my hair ! is it not&#xD;
elaborately arranged?  Now Chandy dear, I'm going to be good.&#xD;
Try to love your only, sister and forget all the annoyance, and'&#xD;
mortifications she has made you suffer. Belle Brandon says I&#xD;
make you writhe sometimes. I suppose it is true, but I did'nt&#xD;
mean to ; I won't any more. I have been a great trial to all who&#xD;
care for me, with my careless ways ; but I think perhaps if I had&#xD;
had a little mother-love, real mother care, I might-, but I don't&#xD;
know. We've one strong cord to bind us together, at any rate,&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
haven't we ?  Papa's love. We are his only children ; he prayed&#xD;
for us and blessed us both, that night. I feel sure he loves us&#xD;
still. I don't believe heavenly joys could blot out dear papa's&#xD;
tenderness."&#xD;
Just then Max came and claimed Chris' hand for the "Prince&#xD;
Imperial," which was forming ; and it was time, for she was about&#xD;
to break down and cry. After she had gone, Chandy stood run-&#xD;
ning his fingers through his hair, oblivious of his white kids, and&#xD;
gazing after'her retreating figure in whimsical bewilderment.&#xD;

CHANDOS' GOOD-BYE.&#xD;
THE fete was over, and Chris alone in her room. A knock at&#xD;
the door, and Chandos enters, both hands out and a funny smile&#xD;
on his face. He takes Chris' gloved fingers in his and seats her&#xD;
close by him on the sofa.&#xD;
"I suppose it is allowable for a fellow to put his arm around&#xD;
you, Chris, when the fellow happens to be your brother ?"&#xD;
"hYou must have plenty of -sisters," replied Chris. "I wonder&#xD;
the girls don't box your ears sometimes for your amazing impu-&#xD;
dence; but we all know there's no harm in you, and you are a&#xD;
handsome boy, Chandy. I am very proud of you."&#xD;
u",Ye'es, so they tell me. But, Chris, we'll consider that sub-&#xD;
ject exhausted. There's no use beating about the bush; let's&#xD;
have it out now. I've been wandering in a labyrinth that beats&#xD;
fair Rosamond's all to chalk, without a thread of a clue. I hate&#xD;
mysteries."&#xD;
"I don't wish to make any mysteries, I'm sure."&#xD;
"Very well, then; just explain your crooked talk this evening.&#xD;
I can't make head or tail of it. I haven't tried to play teacher,&#xD;
to give you hard lessons, bitter tasks, have I? What in thunder&#xD;
did you mean ?"&#xD;
For answer Chris brought out the sketch and placed it in his&#xD;
hands. "I have forgiven it, Chandos. I assure you I am not in&#xD;
the least offended now," said she, wishing to spare his feelings.&#xD;
"I was dreadfully hurt at first. I really thought I could never&#xD;
love you any more; ;but I know you meant well."&#xD;
(654)1&#xD;
&#xD;
Chandy, who had not caught much of her speech, so amused&#xD;
was he with the graphic picture, interrupted her by a hearty-&#xD;
laugh.&#xD;
" Clever, is'nt it?"&#xD;
"Very," replied Chris drily.&#xD;
"By Jove ! as pointed as a Cruikshank!" going off into an-&#xD;
other burst. " The eyes in fine frenzy rolling, and the hair ! oh,&#xD;
Chris, what a guy !"&#xD;
Chris colored indignantly. " How nice to have such a vivid&#xD;
appreciation of one's own productions," she said with flashing&#xD;
eyes. "And it was well judged of you to refine your cruelty by&#xD;
using the kack of the picture you made when-when you was&#xD;
kind and I was happy, in your sick-room, where you never got a&#xD;
drink of water that I did'nt give .you. If you go to stab a friend,&#xD;
always choose the tenderest spot, and use a sharp weapon."&#xD;
Chandos looked at her blazing eyes, and listened to the angry&#xD;
words she poured out, and stopped laughing.&#xD;
"And so, Miss Goldsmith, you have been crediting me with&#xD;
this admirable performance," he began, By this time he had&#xD;
turned the cardboard over in his fingers,'and he gave a start of&#xD;
unmistakable astonishment..&#xD;
" What the deuce is this ? Why, Chris ! it is your head that I&#xD;
offered to color for Otho. Do you remember how he looked ?"&#xD;
" Perfectly-! I have .a disagreeable trick of remembering.&#xD;
You added your autograph to give it stamp and value," said Chris,&#xD;
curling her lip at what she considered ungenerous trifling.&#xD;
"My hen's tracks, certainly, no denying them, though I never&#xD;
saw them before. I wonder if I am a painting-medium."  Chan-&#xD;
dy fell to caressing his chin musingly. "I smell a monstrous&#xD;
mice, Chris ! Nobody ever saw this picture of you except Sa-&#xD;
brina Bradshaw and Belle Brandon. I was vain fool enough to&#xD;
bring my portfolio down into the parlor one evening at Belle's&#xD;
earnest request. She longed to see my crayon heads; .she 'wor-&#xD;
shiped genius-so interested in Art'-foxy little imp ! and I dis-&#xD;
played all my drawings, and got deliciously buttered. I remem-&#xD;
ber it well, and what a pleasant evening we had; and we sang&#xD;

glees, 'In the lonely vale of streams' for one, I remember. Sa-&#xD;
brina is out of the question.' You don't suppose Otho-.-, he&#xD;
might wish to give you the lesson you attributed to me, you&#xD;
know.."&#xD;
Chris made a hasty gesture of denial. " Certainly not," said&#xD;
she decidedly ; "he would despise such an action."&#xD;
Oh, of course ; and yet you thought me capable of it. Thank&#xD;
you; but you need'nt try to fix it up ;" he waved her off. 4"Now&#xD;
the question is, how the mischief did that girl get my sketch?&#xD;
She must have buggled it out of my room. Should'nt I have&#xD;
liked to catch her there ! I'd have turned the key and kept her&#xD;
till she went down on her knees and begged for mercy. I've got&#xD;
it, Chris ! I've got it all!- Miss Filer brought me a handkerchief&#xD;
this morning much ink-stained, and she said, with 'a queer -look,&#xD;
that Miss Brandon had been wiping up her ink with my property,&#xD;
and added, 'she said she found it in the parlor.' Now somebody&#xD;
spilled my i'_k. I thought it was Nobby; he's always knocking&#xD;
over things ; and I had to hand in my Latin prose in pencil, and&#xD;
Prof. Noble got in a great wax about it. I've a big mind to stay&#xD;
at home. Believe I had rather pay her off handsomely than to&#xD;
see Paris."&#xD;
"'Dear Chandy, never mind her ; her reward is sure to come.&#xD;
Let her go ; I don't care in the least now that I know you had no&#xD;
hand in it; and I'll con well the'lesson she gave me, and profit&#xD;
by it. But you are mistaken in supposing that no one saw the&#xD;
sketch, for Belle called all the graduates into the music-room,&#xD;
where I was practicing, and exhibited it, and commented upon&#xD;
the respective merits of the two, and showed them your name&#xD;
beneath. If she had come an hour sooner I should have raged ;&#xD;
but as it was, I went quietly on with my symphony. I had had&#xD;
'a comforter-papa's FRIEND. I was weary and heavy-laden." I&#xD;
let her say her say without turning round." -&#xD;
-"Why did you not seize it and carry it away, and hide it out&#xD;
of their sight-burn it up, tear it in bits ?"&#xD;
"I would not. I thought if my brother desired to give me a&#xD;

lesson, I would not shirk it. It was bitter though  I've such1 a&#xD;
temper, Chandy ; I had to clinch my teeth tight' together."&#xD;
" Chris, I should not think you could be so unjust to- me. I'm a&#xD;
heedless fellow, I know ; but I don't think I've such a bad heart.&#xD;
Here I am going away to-morrow morning-this morning rather,&#xD;
and you would have let me depart with this between us, for you&#xD;
to brood over as you do brood over things! I call that cruelty&#xD;
to animals, myself!"&#xD;
"Chandos !" burst out Chris, rushing at him and putting both&#xD;
arms'around him, "I'll never suspect you again; and ;the next&#xD;
time I am angry with you I'll be sure that you deserve it. We'll&#xD;
be good friends from this out, won't we?"&#xD;
"I should say so, rather," replied Chandos coolly, feeling of&#xD;
his crushed collar. "I did'nt think much about you- for a good&#xD;
while, more fool I; but I do assure you you haven't a warmC&#xD;
admirer on your list than Chandos Goldsmith."&#xD;
" Thank you, Chandy ; that is so kind of you, and I'll let you&#xD;
into a secret that I know will please you. I've turned over a new&#xD;
leaf I'm going to be a particular lady. I'm going to have a&#xD;
couple of places for everything, so as to be sure of finding what&#xD;
I want. Truly, I am. Now you will love me, dear, won't you?"&#xD;
" Why, Chris, won't it be dangerous to get rid of your only&#xD;
fault ? I've had no end of compliments about you this evening,&#xD;
and apropos, I want to speak to you, in fact I must speak "&#xD;
" Yes, Chandy."&#xD;
"You and Otho are still intending to trot in harness together,&#xD;
I suppose. It is a delicate thing to touch, even for a brother, and&#xD;
you are so shy with all your feelings ; but I can't go away without&#xD;
a word or two. In fact I don't feel satisfied with some things I've&#xD;
heard and seen since he got back. He is a fine fellow, and he&#xD;
saved my life ; but if my sister-"&#xD;
"'Don't, Chandos dear," said' Chris, growing pale and sinking&#xD;
back. "That episode is over  I have returned to the epic. I&#xD;
have lost a lover and have gained an experience. It won't kill&#xD;
me   I'm going to be a home inissionary, old maid, you know.&#xD;
I'll nurse your babies one of these days,- and live with you and&#xD;

riedly. "It is of no use to-talk about it. It is all over, and&#xD;
finished' She put her hand over his mouth. "Dear brother,&#xD;
cannot bear it."&#xD;
Chandy feltsheretremble, and noticed the look of deep suffering&#xD;
inher pale face,and took her in his arms with a protecting love&#xD;
which well, became his handsome youth."&#xD;
"kMy own sister, darling girl; you shall be anything you like;&#xD;
keep your secret, only if;that Otho--"&#xD;
" Hush ! you are on forbidden ground. Good night, or rather&#xD;
good morning ; you go on the-early train, I suppose ; I'll just lie&#xD;
down and shut my eyes a little, and come to breakfast, and see&#xD;
you off. I almost wish I was going with you."&#xD;
Come, then ! you shall! I'll wait a week and take you."&#xD;
"Good boy; don't talk nonsense. You know I should not be&#xD;
allowed to go; your eloquence could not compass that. No, dear,&#xD;
I've won the Art Scholarship;-I'm going to stay here and use it&#xD;
--that is what I have to do. I've got through a great deal of&#xD;
thinking Athe last thirty-six hours; I feel ever so old, Chandy.&#xD;
I'l be ateacher; I must have an object in life. . I think I - have&#xD;
a gift to teach; I'll be a Filer.", She smiled, a ghost of a smile'&#xD;
But Chris,. won't your life here in madame's house be uncom-&#xD;
fortable in the present changed aspect of affairs?  Would you&#xD;
not rather remove to some other school ?"&#xD;
"No, good thoughtful Chandos; how kind and manly you can&#xD;
be! I shall try to ignore all the unpleasantness, if there is any&#xD;
and devote myself to my work. The teachers are thorough, and&#xD;
Herr Groenveldt like dear papa to me in kindness and careful&#xD;
training ; and Chandy, he is a true christian. I should not be al-&#xD;
lowed to change schools if I wished it ever'so much; as it is, I&#xD;
am supporting myself. I shall have my clothing, because I shall&#xD;
desire Madame to provide it,-and if any fuss is reade about the&#xD;
bills, I'll pay back the money out of my salary when I teach.'I&#xD;
know quite well that when I come of age I shall have plenty of&#xD;
money;; papa read me his will, though I never told it before&#xD;
and my brother, let'syou and Ido some good with our money."&#xD;

"cOh Chris," broke in Chandy, "what a clever, wonderful girl&#xD;
you are."&#xD;
Am  I ?" she answered, drearily; "only you keep to that impres-&#xD;
son till I get to be Aunt Chrissy, and your. home missionary ;&#xD;
and now good-bye, precious brother ; I believe I anm tired."&#xD;
",Don't get up, Chris, to see me off. Good-bye; I'll write&#xD;
every week and tell you all the larks. Sam and I are going to&#xD;
learn the ropes, so as to take you and Sabrina over when you are&#xD;
ready."&#xD;
"Oh yes, that will be nice ; how fresh your face is ! not fagged&#xD;
at all. Good-bye, pretty boy, good-bye."&#xD;
She put him gently from the room, and sat down before the&#xD;
window, and rested her head wearily upon her hand. The forced&#xD;
calmness, the strength she had too hardly used, forsook her, the&#xD;
forged smiles left her face, and a heavy stillness took possession&#xD;
of her. She felt the air oppressive, and raised the sash; the cold&#xD;
night wind swept over her, she pushed back her hair and let it&#xD;
cool her cheek; as she did so, she touched a withered pansy caught&#xD;
in the Sappho knot; she took it out, kissed it softly, and. dropped&#xD;
it out into the darkness, with one little sob. Her emotions were&#xD;
exhausted ; she could not think or feel any more.&#xD;

CHAPTER FORTY-SEVENTH.&#xD;
FILER COME'S OUT STRONG.&#xD;
THE cold grey of the morning crept up in the east, and still&#xD;
Chris sat before the open window. She heard through a blurr,&#xD;
stirring in the coach house, and the stamping of the horses in&#xD;
their stalls; then Mike's lantern made a round spot of traveling&#xD;
light on her ceiling as he moved about the yard harnessing his&#xD;
team, and then the-sleighs drew up before the door, which were&#xD;
to take the passengers to the early train. The heavy thug of the&#xD;
trunks thrown upon the tressles reached her, and then Mike&#xD;
stamped up and down, threshing his arms for warmth, and blew&#xD;
his -fingers. Then came footsteps over.the crisp snow, and a voice&#xD;
she knew spoke, and was. answered by another'; they conversed&#xD;
in German, and a whiff of their cigar smoke blew over her face.&#xD;
Her lips quivered, and a couple of tears filtered through her&#xD;
closed lids, and she knew that Otho.was gone. The adieus and&#xD;
last words reached her;" Bertha's voiceand Madame's, and the&#xD;
dear:old Professor. The bells tinkled merrily, Mike sung out to&#xD;
his horses, they passed through the great gate, and the hall door&#xD;
clanged after the Groenveldts, who shared together their love and&#xD;
their sorrow. Chris might have seen the outlined form of her&#xD;
lover by stooping forward, but she had let him go without a look.&#xD;
She knew that Chandy .and Sam were about departing; she&#xD;
wished to descend and see then off; she dimly felt an obligation&#xD;
to do so, and tried to rise to call to them, and did stagger to her&#xD;
feet, and then fell senseless to the floor, and forgot everything--&#xD;
hope, fear, sorrow, suffering, were all hushed within her. The&#xD;
wing of the death-angel brushed her forehead, and the chill of his&#xD;
dread presence wrapped her about.&#xD;
(660)&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
Rosenbloom was full of the bustle of departures. Of course&#xD;
all discipline was suspended ; breakfasts were swallowed hurried-&#xD;
ly, and no account made of.absentees. The teachers were as&#xD;
eager to be gone as any, and appetized beforehand the warm wel-&#xD;
comes waiting for them by the home hearths,"and their'brief time&#xD;
of relaxation and rest. Only poor old Filer, she had no friends,&#xD;
she was to remain, and had no end of copy-books to rank aid&#xD;
themes to correct before next term-her work was never done.&#xD;
Chris was not invited home, but told to stay till she got done.&#xD;
with it. Chandy softened the message somewhat, but as Chris&#xD;
happened to be looking over his shoulder while he read his letter,&#xD;
(the widow never wrote to Chris,) his kindness went for nothing.&#xD;
Belle would have had to stay but for an invitation she had se-&#xD;
cured from the Zambranos to spend the vacation at their hotel.&#xD;
Dolores adored her dear Belle, and as for the dark-browed broth-&#xD;
er, he worshiped- her all day, and dreamed of her all night; but&#xD;
there was a slight hitch in Belle's arrangements, since, Madame&#xD;
,had decided to keep her and send for her uncle.&#xD;
Ten o'clock struck, and Sabrina and Zoe burst into Chris's&#xD;
room in their traveling dresses. They were going in the noon&#xD;
train,, and were impatient of her long slumbers; they must talk&#xD;
over the fete, and tell Chris how"wondrously lovely she had been,&#xD;
and how proud they were of her, and kiss her a'dear good-bye;&#xD;
but they must teaze and scold her a little first, she was so lazy.&#xD;
"'As the door on his hinges, so she on her bed,' began Zoe, in&#xD;
a high keyed voice. She stopped suddenly, and the two stared&#xD;
in affright at Chris lying beneath the open window, still and irre-&#xD;
sponsive. Her white face was upturned to the cold wind, which&#xD;
fluttered her thin robe, and played with her loosened hair; her&#xD;
arms were tossed over her head, and no breath came through her&#xD;
ashy lips, drawn tightly across her- teeth, and her wide-open eyes&#xD;
stared at vacancy.  They stooped over her an instant, with&#xD;
~ hushed breath, and then Zoe darted away in search of help.&#xD;
Oddly enough her first impulse was to run~ to the studio, and&#xD;
rouse the dear -old Professor. Hie came, making great strides,&#xD;
his ample 'dressing-gown floating out behind him, ad the tassel&#xD;

&#xD;
of his°smioking-cap vibrating wildly, took the unconscious girl up&#xD;
in hisarms, and placed hey tenderly on the bed. While: hewas&#xD;
feeling at her wrist, andholding up a mirror to her lips, watching&#xD;
anxiously-for the cloud he hoped to see on its surface, Filer&#xD;
came tearig in; her first move was to drag down the sash..&#xD;
" Enough 'to kill a pig ! this room is ! as cold as Greenland !"&#xD;
said she. "I should suppose common ,sense would have shut the&#xD;
window the first thing. Got, a fit, with too much pleasure last&#xD;
night, I expect'; danced herself to death ! Bless my soul! she's&#xD;
as cold as a corpse ! Run instantly, somebody ! bring some hot&#xD;
water! have a fire kindled. Miss Bradshaw, here, take out these&#xD;
pins and things, and we'll give her a hot bath. What could the&#xD;
child have been about with that window open ?"&#xD;
Fortunately there were a score or two of doctors in the house,&#xD;
and one was quickly brought ; but it was a weary time before life&#xD;
came -back. They had nearly settled to the belief that the soul&#xD;
had fled, and then it was only breathing with just the shadow of&#xD;
thoughts.,&#xD;
Sabrina and Zoe stopped till evening, and then took leave with&#xD;
many tears. Madame negatived Miss Bradshaw's proposal to&#xD;
stay and- nurse her friend, and .she left her most unwillingly.&#xD;
Chris opened her eyes at their voices, and kissed them softly; and&#xD;
a faint sigh came up from her breast as she wearily closed them&#xD;
again,&#xD;
She was tenderly cared for. The dear old Professor and Filer&#xD;
shared the duties of the sick room, and she took-what they offered&#xD;
her, and would lie for hours holding the dear old Professor's&#xD;
hand, who sometimes vainly goggled his eyes open, and tossed his&#xD;
grey hair frightfully, in his efforts to keep awake. When Mad-&#xD;
aime'came to her bed, she turned her face as: far away from her&#xD;
as she could, and her brows contracted, and her mouth drooped.&#xD;
But -she would put both arms around dreary old Filer, and fall&#xD;
fast asleep on her breast. Poor patient Filer, who was never&#xD;
snappish, never weary; who couldn't do enough for the invalid,&#xD;
and whpse face got more, peaked and her nose redder with her&#xD;
night-watchings, and who wiped her eyes and sobbed when listen-.&#xD;

r.&#xD;
&#xD;
ing to the sorrowful revelations the child made in her  urmured&#xD;
talk, when her mind wandered; and she shook her fists indignantly&#xD;
at some invisible person, when Chris lived over her night in the&#xD;
cellar, and begged and prayed to be released : and she hugged her&#xD;
up tenderly, and soothed her with a hymn-she sang, actually!&#xD;
Filer sang to Chris, and she liked it! She put up her poor fevered&#xD;
lips and kissed her, and dropped off into a smiling slumber.&#xD;
Though she and Herr Groenveldt exchanged no words on the&#xD;
subject, they knew perfectly why their charge fastened such im-&#xD;
ploring eyes on them when they talked about sending for her&#xD;
mother; and when Madame insisted, the Professor put her down&#xD;
quietly and so effectually as showed that he was capable of gov-&#xD;
erning when he chose to take the reins.&#xD;
And the days wore on, and term-time came again, before our&#xD;
Chris could sit up in her rocking-chair, and eat the toast Filer&#xD;
brought, and the little slices of Winter NelJis which the dear old&#xD;
Professor shaved into wafers and put into her mouth. One&#xD;
day he brought her some pansies among her flowers, and he never&#xD;
forgot the look she gave him, nor the flood of tears which fol-&#xD;
lowed; but it did her good, for she fell asleep, sobbing like a&#xD;
grieved child, and awoke stronger and better.&#xD;
There was another sick girl at Rosenbloom: Mary Ann Wil-&#xD;
liams was down with a fever, typhoid, the doctor said ; but her&#xD;
father and mother came and fetched her away on a bed, to nurse&#xD;
at home, and she left a kiss and her dear love for Chris, both&#xD;
which she sent by Filer. " Her good, precious Filer, who had&#xD;
been such a tender friend to her," she said.&#xD;
Belle Brandon went off with flying colors. She managed&#xD;
Madame so well that her uncle was not sent for, nor was she dis-&#xD;
graced; she so glozed over her sins that that dignitary nearly&#xD;
doubted the evidence of her own senses, and the Zambranos car-&#xD;
ried her off with them as a treasure to be carefully watched-a&#xD;
goddess to be worshipped.&#xD;
She left a written confession of her part in Ruth. Blair's mis-&#xD;
ery ; she found she could not get off without. Herr Groenveldt&#xD;
insisted upon that act of justice--and al: o the rough sketches; but&#xD;

Madame almost believed' her when she opened her blue eyes in&#xD;
childish innocence and protested that she meant only a little joke.&#xD;
She todk-gushing leave of' all the people in the house she thought&#xD;
worth-it;,and especial delight in kissing Herr Groenveldt on both&#xD;
cheeks, because she saw that he did not wish to have her; and&#xD;
looked bewitchingly' beautiful in her grey suit when she took&#xD;
Henrique Zambrano's arm, and turned her back upon hei school&#xD;
life forever.&#xD;
When, in her first leisure, Madame sat down to write to Ruth&#xD;
Blair, intending to inclose the confessions in her letter, they were&#xD;
nowhere to be found, though heriwriting desk was locked, and&#xD;
she wore the key upon her watch-chain.&#xD;

with my blessing; and you may marry or bury, or otherwise dis-&#xD;
pose of Widow Golksmith's Daughter - and her friends, as you&#xD;
like ; but if, as I hope, you feel a human interest in them, and&#xD;
will give us the pleasure of your delightful society, we will take&#xD;
a spring trip, when the maple-wings are flying, and the pansies&#xD;
open their eyes, to Roaring River and Rosenbloom-and so, a&#xD;
kind good-night.&#xD;
