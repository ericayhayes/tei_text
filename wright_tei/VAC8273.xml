PRE FACE.&#xD;
Some writer~ has said that the preface is the best part&#xD;
of a book. Now I should dislike very much to think that&#xD;
it formed the best part of this volume that I have given&#xD;
to the public with so many misgivings. My excuses in&#xD;
writing this little story are simiple- these: To while away&#xD;
the lonely wintry hours in the mountain, and to entertain&#xD;
in a measure the fireside group. I had no idea at the time&#xD;
it would go to the press, but at the urgent request of a&#xD;
friend' was prevailed upon to send it, and found to my&#xD;
*sa isfactiou. that it was kindly received.&#xD;
If liy readers will find any pleasure in its perusal, I&#xD;
sli all be much pleased, and will be amply rewarded for the&#xD;
labor it cost mec.&#xD;

bear, don't you think? Who is it that does not love&#xD;
to be praised and admired? and who is it that likes&#xD;
to be called repulsive and ugly? In all this wide&#xD;

so, since a pair of dimpled arms entwined themselves&#xD;
'lovingly around my Old neck, not many days ag&#xD;
giving mc a great hug, and (he owner saying: "I love&#xD;
the name of John; it is so easy to call, and all dear&#xD;
old people ought to be called John, too." Now don't&#xD;
come to the hasty conclusion, my friends, that these&#xD;
little arms belong to me. Oh ! no such thing; but&#xD;
you shall hear all about them as~J go along and telL&#xD;
the old man's story."&#xD;
I must go back far into the past, over many, many&#xD;
eventful years, with their black, lowering clouds and&#xD;
heavy storms that bowed the great oak and crushed the&#xD;
slender lily. It is sad to think over events which were&#xD;
fraught with sorrow, but the little Fairy, who sai(l she&#xD;
loved even my name, and who lino'ers round the "old&#xD;
man," ministering to him, smoothing his hoary locks&#xD;
and kissing his wrinkled forehead, requests it, an(l I&#xD;
am a doat~ng old man enough to sit down and spend a&#xD;
couple of hours every day for my little darling's enter~&#xD;
tainment. First, then, in commencing, I must, in jus-&#xD;
ti6c to myselg, tell you who I am, what I am and where&#xD;
I came from.&#xD;
II was born in merry, old England, in a pretty white&#xD;
cottage situate&amp;amp; in a very verdant, fertile valley, not&#xD;
many miles from the celebrated Thames. lit was there&#xD;
that I saw the first peep of daylight, uttered the first&#xD;
sound that escaped from my lips, took my first steps, got&#xD;
the first thu~p on my big head, learned to hum that&#xD;
very charming old English nursery song, "Pollie, put&#xD;
the kettle on, and thcn in the little green yard, span-&#xD;
gled with its buttercups and daisies (as I last remember&#xD;

tie daughters, to ~vhom h~ devoted his life. In course&#xD;
of time the little girls, as all little girls do, gre~v up to&#xD;
be young ladies and got married. The eldest, Mary,&#xD;
married a United States Navy Captain~ and ~vent to&#xD;
the great Republic to live; here I drop all further&#xD;
mention of' this aunt of mine, as I heard very little of&#xD;
her after my mother's death, but think she (lied shoi~t1v&#xD;
after her arrival in America. My mother was some&#xD;
ycar~' younger than her sister, was very lovely, quite an&#xD;
heiress and well connected. My father was the son of&#xD;
an I~nglish barrister, Mr. James Meredith. He was&#xD;
an unusually fine-looking young man, as the portrait&#xD;
which hangs not far from here has told me, very lre~&#xD;
possessing in appearance (which legacy he forgot to&#xD;
bequeath to his pooP son), and an oratorical genius; at&#xD;
an early age he was admitted to the bar and was corn~&#xD;
pletely lionized. Country cousins s~varmed aroun(t&#xD;
him a~ bees around the sWeetest flower. Sisters were&#xD;
completely lost in admiration at this model of a young&#xD;
man, with his many graces and winning address. How&#xD;
it was that II was so ugly goodness only knows, when&#xD;
bc Lii my mother and father were so peerless, except as&#xD;
grammarians explain it, on the principle that "two neg-'.&#xD;
at~ves arc equivalent to an a rrnative;" but I am eom~&#xD;
forced by the old adage, "Pretty is as pretty does."&#xD;
My father was a poor young man up to the time be&#xD;
married my mother ; so in marrying her, lie won both&#xD;
a fortune and a beauty. The meeting took place ~&#xD;
follows:&#xD;
it was oh a lovely May evening in I 7-~-, ~vhen the&#xD;

day. So as hastily as (lomestics coul(I arran~c and r"~&#xD;
in order, the best rooms in the hotel were l)repared and&#xD;
made cQlnfc)rtable for the reception of' the distinguished&#xD;
guests who had made such an impression on the eoin~&#xD;

Well, landlord," said the new arrival ,as he found&#xD;
hiniselfseaPxl upon the open l)iazza oJ)posite the worthy&#xD;
host, after paying the necessary attention to his young&#xD;
traveling companion, "you seem to be right quiet here&#xD;
in tour little town ; not much, I suppose, to break the&#xD;
monotony?'&#xD;
"Well, nq;' answered the landlord, taking his pipe.&#xD;
from his mouth and blowing a gi~eat puff of smoke&#xD;
upwards; "there is not a great deal, to. be sure; but&#xD;
now and then there is a little excitement, and to-night,&#xD;
I believe, there is to be a slight variation."&#xD;
"In what way?" asked the guest; "an opera Con&#xD;
pmy, or anything of that kind?" thinking at the time&#xD;
of th'e Young lady.&#xD;
"Not not" said the host," not pute so grand as that;&#xD;
I'&#xD;

but a fine speech from a talented young barrister, who&#xD;
seems to 1)e making quite a naine for l)irflsClf Mis&#xD;

" Ah ! I should like very much to hear him, and&#xD;
think my little daughter WoUI(l not ol~jeet to it either;&#xD;
I shall go and see."&#xD;
"it can't be J)OSsd)le," sai(I the facetious landlord,&#xD;
"that the young lady is the daughter of so young a&#xD;
gentleman as yourself? Why, I would not suppose&#xD;
such a hung."&#xD;
"Ohm, yes !" ~said the guest, with a pleased smile,&#xD;
thinking the host very agreeable; "oh, yes! she is my&#xD;
own daughter, and has a sister some years older ~than&#xD;
herself'."&#xD;
"Well, well," said the landlord, "I should never&#xD;
helievc it if I had not heard it from your own lips."&#xD;
The gentleman bowed, in acknowledgement to the&#xD;
compliment, and withdrew to his daughter's room.&#xD;
"You may come in," said a soft voice, in answer to&#xD;
his knock; "I am n6t asleep."&#xD;
am glad of it," said he, entering. "Arc von&#xD;
fatigued, my little dear?"&#xD;
"No, indeed. I feel as fresh as the morn ,' laughinz.&#xD;
and catching his hands affectionately: "arid how does&#xD;
my papa feel ?"&#xD;
"Not quite so fresh a~ my pretty daughter; though,&#xD;
of course, it wouldn't be supposed that an ~oiJ man&#xD;
should feel like a young lady~ of eighteen; butt ~uever~&#xD;

not old,, you arc just as young-looking~and handsome&#xD;
as anybody."&#xD;
"Oh! yes, Ettic fia±tcrcr; that sounds mighty sweet&#xD;
from your pretty lips, but the old glass, there, is not&#xD;
such a story~teilcr. I have come to take you to the&#xD;
hall, where there i3 to be a fine speech delivered by a&#xD;

rsin~' star '~ ~             .,   to be given, I&#xD;
believe, for some charitable purpose. Are you willing&#xD;
to go? Would you like it? We shall be here for&#xD;
several days, so you shall know this famous orator and&#xD;
coquct with him as much as you please, so that you&#xD;
won't be lonesome while my business detains me."&#xD;
"For shame, papa! I would not coquet with an&#xD;
body. You surely would not accusee me of' such a&#xD;
thing! Why, what do you suppose I am made of:&#xD;
"Why, what all other young ladies are made&#xD;
pretty one. What else should you be made of?"&#xD;
"You ar~ a naughty, teasing papa to say your daug 1i~&#xD;
ter is a flirt. For shame ! Never mind; I will nQt&#xD;
give you a chance to say such things of me macli&#xD;
* I'm going to marry the first one that. will ask&#xD;
me, even if it is this great orator, just to prove to you&#xD;
that you are maligning your daughter in a most fearful&#xD;
manner."&#xD;
The father laughed, rand patting her on the head,&#xD;
said, playfully: "Well, well, come on, now, and I&#xD;
won't tease any more if you will only hurry and put&#xD;
your bonnet, for it is nearly time."&#xD;
"I'll be ready in a fe~ minutes. Just let me put&#xD;
this flower ir~ my hair, for you know this' Demosthenes&#xD;
must fall in love with me, and little flowers are great&#xD;
&#xD;
"Especially when they are such flowers as I possess,"&#xD;
returned the fond father, taking her hand and placing~&#xD;
0&#xD;
"That compliment is just as sweet as my darling&#xD;
papa," she said, as they passed out together.&#xD;
The hall in which the young barrister, James Mere-&#xD;
dith, was to speak was large, brilliantly illuminated,&#xD;
and decorated with the first spring flowers, wreathed&#xD;
with sprays of arbor vitve, which hung in graceful gar-&#xD;
lands all around the spacious apartment. It was well&#xD;
filled with the youth and beauty of the town, Yirrayed in&#xD;
their finest apparel. The English gentleman and his&#xD;
daughter were honored with pleasant seats, and in&#xD;
which the young lady's charms were shown to the best&#xD;
advantage. Nor was my grandfather ashamed of the&#xD;
fair young creature that was seated beside him, oh! no;&#xD;
on the contrary, lie was both pleased and proud, as on&#xD;
every side lie met glances of admiration cast upon her:&#xD;
and if my mother (for you must know by this time&#xD;
that the pretty girl was i~o other than she, for I would&#xD;
not be tasking~ myself to tell you of Peol)le who lived&#xD;
and loved before I was born unless I ~yas deeply inter-&#xD;
ested in them, and who could I be more interested in&#xD;
than in my parents?) showed to advantage, my father&#xD;
(lid too; for I have been told that never in the to~vn&#xD;
of B , or out of it, was such an oration listened to&#xD;
~vith such attention and marked approval. And as the&#xD;
bouquets of beautiful flowers fell upon the stage, my&#xD;
mother snatched the tiny blossom from her own sunny&#xD;
hair and threw it at his feet, where lie singled it out&#xD;
from the rest, smiling with pleasure, bowed low and&#xD;

I am not going to linger long~o ver my parents' court-~&#xD;
ship, for, since the days of Adam, the sameness in&#xD;
courtships makes all, except your own particular one,&#xD;
tiresome. Suffice it to say that, ifl their ease the course&#xD;
of true love ran smoothly enough; for my grandfather&#xD;
liked and admired the o'enius, and was far too&#xD;
indulgent to his favoY~ite child to deny her one single&#xD;
wish. So, eighteen months from the ~iglit of which I&#xD;
have just spoken, they ~vei~e marrie(l. My grandfht.h er&#xD;

many years of absence, is stilt so dear to me from t ~e&#xD;

I spent my happiest days. My parents were (levo~ ~d&#xD;

his liami in my own. Never had .1 felt such a burnirv~&#xD;
palm. it horrified me.  ~cver shall I forget it, or the&#xD;
l)icture my y~tre;its presented. My father, with hi.~&#xD;
noble brow contracted with deep pain, leaning hit;&#xD;
throbbing head on my mother's slender shoulder, whilst&#xD;
she, with eyes wild with despair and arms clasped con~&#xD;
vulsively around him, wept as only a loving wife&#xD;
can weep at seeing death written upon the face of&#xD;
her husband. I StOO(1 mute and motionless, not know-'&#xD;
ii~g, and yet don't know, which I felt for most, my&#xD;
father passing away whilst yet in the prime of life, or&#xD;
my poor sorrow-stricken mother. After a few moments&#xD;
my father Sj)Ol{C:&#xD;
"Dear wife~" sai(l he, "do not grieve; cease weep-&#xD;
ing and sorrowing; try to be resigned to our heavenly&#xD;
Father's will; for the decree has gone forth, and I must&#xD;
die; this disease will not spare me longer*&#xD;
(balm for my sake."&#xD;
"Hush, oh! hush; do not say that you are going t~&#xD;
leave me," sobbed my mother. "You will not, shall&#xD;
not leave me. Do not say those awful words again or&#xD;
they will kill me. Oh, my merciful Saviour, do not&#xD;
take my husband front me!"&#xD;
She st01)ped suddenly in her wild cry, for she saw&#xD;
that her terror and excitement were increasing the fear-&#xD;
ful fever which my father had; this Subdued her at&#xD;
once, an(1, Wee'~)iflo' silently she leaned her face on her&#xD;

"I mean, my child, that I am going to leave you.&#xD;

CHAPTER III.&#xD;
JOHN MAKES THE ACQUAINTANCE OP IllS COUSINS.&#xD;
T be tired of- me, dear friends, for I must&#xD;
reduce myself to you right often before my&#xD;
story finishes.&#xD;
My life, though dark and stormy, has had&#xD;
its gleams of sunshine here and there to brighten it, as&#xD;
~sometimes we can catch a glimpse of- heaven's blue&#xD;
when the sky is o'ereast with the heaviest, blackest&#xD;
'clouds, and the bright flashes of electricity illumi-&#xD;
nating the scene makes us ,oblivious for the moment&#xD;
of the gloominess of the path it travels.&#xD;
It was only darkness to me everywhere when my&#xD;
mother was laid to sleep, and as I. threw myself upon&#xD;
the new-made grave with a cry of agony and pain, I&#xD;
thought my heart was breaking. And why didn't it?&#xD;
I have asked myself since. If it only had, what a life&#xD;
of sorrow would have been spared me. With nay face&#xD;
buried in my hands and my heart in my mother's coffin,&#xD;
I leaned upon. the cold clay, with the evening sunbeams&#xD;
playing through the trees, making cheerful all things&#xD;
except nay young life. "Mother, will you never come&#xD;
back?" I asked again and again, and each time the dis-&#xD;
tant hills echoed never. Gradually, in addition to the&#xD;
pain of being forever separated from her, a sense of&#xD;
loneliness and want came over mc, and I began to real-&#xD;
ize that I was indeed alone, with no kind friend to help&#xD;
me, when a hand was gently placed on my shoulder,&#xD;
and a low voice said:&#xD;
&#xD;
II&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
s&#xD;
&#xD;
OR,. RETRIflUTION.&#xD;
"Don't be so sad, my child. You shall come with&#xD;
mc and I will take care of you.".&#xD;
I rose from my kneeling posture, and confronted a&#xD;
richly dressed and handsome gentleman. I was too&#xD;
young then and too deeply grieved to think of much,&#xD;
but his elegant dress struck my fancy instantly, and for&#xD;
a moment I forgot that II stood by my mother's last~&#xD;
resting place, so completely lost in wonderr at the&#xD;
beautiful dress, with its great, shining buttons, brilliant&#xD;
studs, massive chain, and beautiful shirt frills. I thought&#xD;
I had never seen anything so magnificent before, and&#xD;
almost fancied myself in the presence of some prince&#xD;
from fairy land. The enchantment was broken by the&#xD;
gentleman taking my hand and saying:&#xD;
"My poor little boy, you have suffered a great loss;&#xD;
but come with me and I will take you to my pretty&#xD;
home and try to make you happy. I am your cousin,&#xD;
Sir Clarence Graham, your mother's only living rela-&#xD;
two and now your protector. Come quietly away;&#xD;
this is not a good place for you; it will make you think&#xD;
too much of your poor mother."&#xD;
r1?l~c latter -part of this speech I thought very unkind.&#xD;
\~rlV should I not think of~ahy nxt-her ~? Though I&#xD;
was much embarrassed at being in the presence of so&#xD;
great a. person as Sir Clarence, still I was not too much&#xD;
so to say: "I will think of my mother as much as I&#xD;
want to. Wasn't she my mother and didn't she love&#xD;
me more than any one else?" Here I completely&#xD;
broke down and sobbed so violently that my cousin&#xD;
became alarmed.&#xD;
"Don't cry," he said, soothingly; "it will make you&#xD;

sick, ai~d you won't be able to take the long jour1~ey&#xD;
that is before you. Come now," and taking my hand&#xD;
in his, lead me baek to my home.&#xD;
It did not take Sir Clarence long to make arrange-&#xD;
ments for our departure, for he seelue(1 anxious to be&#xD;
gone, whilst I was thinking of the two graves in the&#xD;
~quiet churchyard and clinging to each old servant a.;&#xD;
they gathered around to bid the little o1'l)hIaIi go:4-&#xD;
bye, as if their kind hands could keep me forevei' lILNlP&#xD;
the place where my mother and father rested.&#xD;
" This won't do, my boy," said Sir Clarence,, rather&#xD;
hastily, as Im saw me sobbing on the neck of my old&#xD;
nurse, whilst she, in broken accents, was lamenting my&#xD;
departure. "This won't do,. lids ww~'i (10," lie kept&#xD;
repeating as he took me by the hian(I and led me away.&#xD;
"Come, clii Id, come, we do not want to be all night&#xD;
*     traveling. Xou must come sometime and ,just as well&#xD;
now as any other."&#xD;
And so I went away, parted from my native land&#xD;
and that little honv~ that had been my 'shelter from&#xD;
*     infancy,, where the wild rose and honey-suckle, climb-&#xD;
*     ing over the lattice formed such a sweet and rustic pie~&#xD;
hire, whilst all around spoke of peace and quiet, love-&#xD;
liness and repose.&#xD;
I leaned from the carriage window as I heard my&#xD;
old Scotch terrier whine after mc, and as I did so, the&#xD;
big white eat sprang upon the gate Post with a mew,&#xD;
intended, I thought, for a farewell; even the chickens,&#xD;
ducks and geese flew after the vehicle; as if to bid adieu&#xD;
to their little master, and as my eyes caught a last&#xD;
g~impsc of the great trees that surrounded my home,&#xD;
&#xD;
On, IIEThIBUTION.             I&#xD;
and of the river Thames, on whose bosom ~cveral&#xD;
white sails were visible, I laid my head down in the&#xD;
corner of the earria~e and wept myself to sleep.&#xD;
I know 1U~t how long I slept, but when I Opened my&#xD;
eyes I found my COUSlIl rea(Iiflg the newspaper very&#xD;
qil ietly, and appfIrCi~ fly 01)1 i viotis of my existence.&#xD;
I was both heart-sore and weary as the evening&#xD;
a(IVUflCe(l, an(l bad i~egiin to wonder how I could live&#xD;
with Sir Clarence if lie never spoke to me, when he&#xD;
suddenly raised liislead and ~ome~vbat startled me by&#xD;
asking:&#xD;
"Are you tired, child?&#xD;
"Yes," I answered, " very tired."&#xD;
"I am sorry," was the brief reply, as he continued&#xD;
his reading. What a queer man, I thought. I would&#xD;
like to know what lie finds so interesting in that paper.&#xD;
Maybe lie can't speak much English. Mamma told&#xD;
me he lived in Ireland. I continued thinking a great&#xD;
deal, looking all the time at my cousin, till at length&#xD;
he laid down his papa' and asked:&#xD;
"Well, John, how do you think you will like living&#xD;
in old Ireland?"&#xD;
"Ii don't know," II answered ; " wiji I have to live&#xD;
there lon~ ~"&#xD;
"Yes, I Suppose so,'? he r&amp;amp;urned ; " but I think&#xD;
you will like it when you see my little girls and get&#xD;
acquainted with them."&#xD;
"Little girls !" I said. "Where arc they? Why&#xD;
have you little girls?"&#xD;
"Ahi ! faith, that I have," lie answered, smiling;&#xD;
"two of the bonniest that ever trod on old Ireland's&#xD;

to the word, she sprang 0ff like an arrow, nor did she&#xD;
4op till she was fairly seated on the steps of the&#xD;
mansion.&#xD;
I felt really ashamed, beingTheaten by a little girl&#xD;

"No, indeed," I answered, "I COIII(lfl't get angry&#xD;

about to add more, when looking up I saw Eleanor.&#xD;

her little sister wore oliiy a J)lain pink gingham with-&#xD;
out (lecoratioa or ornament.&#xD;
~Xro~i are an ilnpu(lent, ill-bred' boy," she cried,&#xD;

the hand, saying "You shall never again ~)lay with&#xD;

girl with her;&#xD;
And this is how I first met my cousins. One of&#xD;
them I had already learned to love, for her s~vectness,&#xD;
amiability, and free, easy manners had attracted me&#xD;
irresistibly towards her. The other I scorned, diShike(l,&#xD;
and felt that I almost hated, though I thought her very&#xD;
beautiful; still, she was so repulsive that I felt I could&#xD;
never feel a friendship for her. I was still thinking of&#xD;
them, and wondering if I must enter the house, when&#xD;
I heard my cousin Clarence ordering a servant "to&#xD;
hunt mc up and 1)ring inc to hum, for I must be hun-&#xD;

rook my hand; "there, therq, darl~nt, dry your eyes&#xD;
and co~nO to your supper, and you'll be all the better&#xD;
for it."&#xD;
"I don't want any supper," I cried, "juSt 1 inc&#xD;

"I know you feel very lonesome, my little boy, and&#xD;
sorro~vful, too ~ but come ~o your supper, child, or the&#xD;
master won't like it."&#xD;
I allowed him to take my hand and lead me away&#xD;
into the dining-room. I was completely dazed by the&#xD;
brightness of the silver-plate and the gaudy colors on&#xD;
the delicate china. I felt like a fish out of water when&#xD;
I seated myself; ev~n the beautiful lamps attracted me&#xD;
with the figures of w~od nymphs wreathing fern leaves&#xD;
to place on their graceful heads. The pictures, too,&#xD;
were magnificent and richly colored, and I noticed&#xD;
particularly the richly carved side-board with its mar-&#xD;
ble top. I was 50 i)usy looking at all this splendor&#xD;
that I forgot the presence of the family at the table&#xD;
until little Nita, who had moved her chair close to' me,&#xD;
said: "Do eat, do eat something, Johnnie; I know&#xD;
you must be hungry, now, are you not?" and she&#xD;
placed a hot light roll on my plate.&#xD;
"Yes, I ani right hungry," and was soon feasting on&#xD;
the good things with which my cousin Clarence's table&#xD;
was plentifully supplied, though there Eleanor sat, my&#xD;
u~s~a-vis, looking haughtier and more scornful than&#xD;
ever, and doing everything bitt positively making faces&#xD;
at me. On her right sat another lad~y, whom Nita&#xD;
informed me was Eleanor's French governess, "and&#xD;
&#xD;

they like each other very much," she continued, "and&#xD;

be so disagreeable for you." ~ ~vas not a11o~~ed to&#xD;
say much during meal times, ~ when Sir Clarence&#xD;
made th~ si~u to depart, she rose hurriedly, stole her&#xD;
little hand into mine and whispered, "Come, now; I&#xD;
will show you all my pots." Away we went, first to&#xD;
the dog kennel, where the lazy quadrupeds were sleep-.&#xD;
ing away, bat, on our near approach, grumbled and&#xD;
growled until they recognized their young mistress,&#xD;
when they j unipecl and fairly danced for joy at the very&#xD;
sight of her. After we had given them their supper,&#xD;
we walked to see the birds, who had their pretty heads&#xD;
tucked away under their wings and too fast asleep to&#xD;
mind our approach. So onward we wont, from one&#xD;
thing to another, till the bell sumnioned us to retire,&#xD;
and the first kiss that was ever imprinted on my lips&#xD;
by a little girl was pressed there that night, and I&#xD;
went to sleep and dreamed of it.&#xD;

piness. She would often pass us in our sports, east&#xD;
upon us a look of supreme contempt, and go on with-.&#xD;
out uttering a word. We tried to avoid her as much&#xD;
as possible. I never liked he" but for Nita's sake,&#xD;
-,   ,&#xD;
always treated her respectfully, though at times it was&#xD;
very hard to (10 so, when I saw the rude, rough man-.&#xD;
ner in which she treated her little sister. Often I&#xD;
would be on tIme point of breaking out into a reproach,&#xD;
when a look of appeal from Nita would hush me&#xD;
instantly.&#xD;

looked from ihe picture to the little girl, and not till&#xD;
then did I discover the reseniblanee.&#xD;
" Nita, was that your mother? " I asked.&#xD;

"Now, tell me," I said, "why have you acted so&#xD;
curiously? That must be your mother, for you are&#xD;
exactly like her."&#xD;
"Y&amp;amp;s John that is my mother, but (10 not let papa&#xD;

and pne evening I heard old Patrick say that little&#xD;
Nita's mother was a much lovelier person in every way&#xD;

Eleanor and I were not sisters? 'To be sure you are,&#xD;
you foolish child. Go away an(l never come to inc&#xD;

much annoyed and when I, was leaving him he called&#xD;
me back and said: 'What made you ask me that,&#xD;
child?' I told him what I had heard Patrick say.&#xD;
You know when papagets angry lie gets very angry,&#xD;

she inherits all this from her plebeian mother. I&#xD;
might have known that it would be impossible to&#xD;
reffue her. She will never make a (lecent entry into&#xD;
society, never. Out if she were only ?like her sister.&#xD;
What a superb girl Ekanor is, with so much o'ood,&#xD;
taste, exquisite penetration, and sodio~nified and stately.&#xD;
I have Just reason to be proud of her, and for having&#xD;
hera for my companion, for she inibibes all my fiuucW3&#xD;
and tastes thoroughly--a fine girl, a fine girl."&#xD;
But whilst Sir Clarence was thinking all this, whV&#xD;
did he not think also, that it was owing to his ncgkct&#xD;
and his oldest daughter's statements that Ii i~ younger&#xD;
child appeared to such disadvantage. She ~vas neither&#xD;
inferior nor weak-minded. On the contrary, si uc was&#xD;
high4oncd, with chaste and beautiful tastes, a Ii ighly-,&#xD;
gifted mind and bright an(l striking ideas e~i~bi~~d&#xD;
with much simplicity, generosity and gentleness of&#xD;
nature, which bore a striking contrast, and which was&#xD;
very agreeable to the haughtiness, amounting to rude..&#xD;
ness, and imperiousness of Eleanor.&#xD;
One evening, a circumstan&amp;amp; occurred which appeared&#xD;
propitious to Nita's future happiness; but, unhappily,&#xD;
fkvorable circumstances to-day may be counteracted by&#xD;
ynf'av'orable &amp;amp;ncs to-morrow. On this particular even-&#xD;
ing, Mta and I were dying kites in the yard and play-&#xD;
ing about as usual. She was in a most gleeful humor,&#xD;
and seemed, by her exuberance of spirits, to have&#xD;
infused her cheerfulness and gaiety into me, for never&#xD;
did I feel so full of fun and Pleasure. I had given her&#xD;
kite a lift on a strong breeze which had just sprang up,&#xD;
and called to her to run and see bow it wouhi sail on&#xD;
&#xD;
K'&#xD;
&#xD;
38&#xD;
&#xD;
the aiL' like a lU1(rC l)ird. She sprang off instantly, and&#xD;
liet' little light fi~'et seemed fairly to fly as she ran&#xD;
tI~~o~~0h thc )LUd with the flying kite. d tried to keep&#xD;
up with her, but might as well have tried to keep up&#xD;
with the young auitelope, and I ha(l to stop for breath.&#xD;
l;('iIig iie~ii' the steps of the 1)alcony, I seate(I myself to&#xD;
admire her swiftness and graceful little form ; a slight&#xD;
noise caused me to look around, a~id I saw Sir Clar-&#xD;
enee, Flean(W and the Ercuiehi governess watching Nita&#xD;
~also. 1 saw by the expression of Sir Clarence's face&#xD;
that he was admiring his little (1au~11ter.&#xD;
"1 declare, he length said, " she's as 0-race-&#xD;
ful as a gazelle. Why, her f~et scarcely toudi the&#xD;
ground. But, ab ! there, the string has broken. Poor&#xD;
little fairy, how disconsolate she looks. She is scarcely&#xD;
larger than a humming l)ird, she is so tiny."&#xD;
At this point,.Nita camP running up, and stooped to&#xD;
pick up a little guinea ~g which her father hal given&#xD;
her sonic days before, and to which she seemed devo-&#xD;
tedly attached. As she was about' to seat herself beside&#xD;
me, with the guinea hugged tightly to her breast, her&#xD;
father leaned towards her, and said:&#xD;
"Are you tired, little girl ?"&#xD;
"A little bit, papa," she answered, laughing, going&#xD;
up to him; "Did you see my kite?"&#xD;
here Eleanor interposed&#xD;
"Why, papa, ouP would think you never saw a kite&#xD;
fly before. I'm sure it's very easy to do.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, yes, (laughteV, he answered, "it~s. easy&#xD;

on?" turning to Nita.&#xD;

She was about to answer when Eleanor said : "(live&#xD;

INita, ~itliout a word, placed it in her arms. She&#xD;

upon the marble floor, gave two or three faint moans,&#xD;
while one or two convulsions j)assed over its little body,&#xD;
and then lay quiet and dead.&#xD;
A cry of pain burst from Nita's white lips, while the&#xD;
tears dreamed from her beautiful eves.&#xD;
"Ah, my poor little guinea ! m~iy poor little gui~mea&#xD;
Sister Eleanor, why did von do it ~ Alt ! j)apa, 18 it&#xD;
really dead'? Look! look!"&#xD;
"Yes~ my child,', he answered, half sorrowfully,&#xD;
taking her hand ; "yes, it is dead, but papa will give&#xD;
von another one very soon."&#xD;
Turning to Eleanor, he said:&#xD;
"You have pained me' very much, my daughter, by&#xD;
giving way to your temper in such an unladylike&#xD;
manner. Try, hereafter, Lo have more control over&#xD;
yourself." lie then stooped and kissed Nita's fore-&#xD;
head and drew her away with him. I followed, and&#xD;
we bent our steps towar&amp;amp;s the river. During the rest&#xD;
of the evening, Sir Clarence devoted, himself to us,&#xD;
Jiared in our am'~ements, related the most wonderful&#xD;
tales for our entertainment, and altogether we had a&#xD;
most charniin~ time. ~ita was inexj)rCSsiblr happy.&#xD;
&#xD;
Never before hind her father displayed such clernonstra~&#xD;
tious of affection fbi' her, his neglected little girl.&#xD;
Whmemi the I)ell rang that night for us to retire, my cousin&#xD;
kissed his younger child in a tender, fiitherly manner,&#xD;
calling her his little darling, and asked God to bless&#xD;
her. Me, also, lie kissed in a kind, caressing way, bid-&#xD;
ding mc be a good boy an(l to get up early, and we&#xD;
would all three go fishing on the river in the morning.&#xD;
I left his study, in which we had been lately sitting,&#xD;
and, boy-like, went 1)oIlnditIg up stairs to my chamber.&#xD;
Just as I was about to lay my hafl(l on th~ knob of the&#xD;
door, I felt a soft touch on my shoulder, and ~ita&#xD;
whispered, "Oh, Johnnic, I'm so happy." Then, kiss-&#xD;
ing my cheek, she ran off hurriedly in an cestacy of&#xD;
joy, an(l I, big, foolish, boy, went to bed and wept ~vith&#xD;
happiness at the good fortune of the little girl whom I&#xD;
so dearly loved. And this good fortune and excessive&#xD;
happiness lasted only for one short week, during which&#xD;
time Sir Clarence had us with him constantly. lie&#xD;
~)1aye~l ball with us and took us long walks through&#xD;
the fields, told us marvelou* tales of furies, genii,&#xD;
dwarfs and hobgoblins, rode with us on our ponies, and&#xD;
in all our sports he was partaker. During these short&#xD;
seven days Eleanor was the most miserable person II&#xD;
ever knew. She trembled for fear Nita would rival&#xD;
her in her father's love. There was another motive,&#xD;
too. Eleanor was both selfish and covetous, and the&#xD;
presents which Sir Clarence gave to his young daugh-&#xD;
ter during that week were looked upon by her with the&#xD;
greatest envy; and, day after day she wondered how&#xD;
she eould, with her wiles amid artifices, misrepresent&#xD;

You have displeased me beyond me~isiire."&#xD;
"And you, Miss Nita, have behaved quite as badly&#xD;
as your cousin. You should be ashamed of yourself.&#xD;
See what you have made your sister suffer. I never&#xD;
heard of such conduct and such. unladylike behavior."&#xD;
"But, father," cried the child, "I did not hit Elca-.&#xD;
nor purposely ; T really did not. I could not help the&#xD;
way the shuttle-cock flew."&#xD;
"Papa, I say it was not accidental ; she hit me pill'-&#xD;
poscly4 I was watching them playing through the&#xD;
window, and they had kept up the game ever so many&#xD;
hundred without mission' till I came in; then I was&#xD;
made. a taro'et, instantly, ansi Nita and John pretend to&#xD;
say it was accidental."&#xD;
"Well, well, my daughter," began Sir Clarence,&#xD;
"they will both pay for this, for I am displeased, very&#xD;
much displeased, indeed. here, Mademoiselle Marie,"&#xD;
addressing the Prench governess of ~he little girl,&#xD;
"take this pupil ~of yours and lock her up in the small&#xD;
room in the third story; she is to remain there till bed-&#xD;
time without .supper. I wish to be strictly obeyed,"&#xD;
he continued, as he saw something like reluctance in&#xD;
the kind woman's face, "I wish and will be, you under-&#xD;
stand, Mademoiselle?"&#xD;
The woman bowed, and taking Nita'5 hand, left the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
"INow," said Sir Clarence, turning to me, "go to my&#xD;
study. and wait there till I come. ~&#xD;
"Certainly," thought I, as I found myself seated by&#xD;
the window of the room where no one entered but the&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
iw~ister, "certainly, he doesn't think to treat mc as a&#xD;
child? I wonder what he will say?"&#xD;
I had little time for reflection, for iii a very few min-&#xD;
utes Sir Clarence entered. lie drew a chair near me,&#xD;
and, after a few minutes silence, began a lecture which&#xD;
1 hope wifl never be inflicted upon any other poor boy.&#xD;
After this, I was sent to undergo the same punishment&#xD;
as poor little Nita.&#xD;
"Well," thought 1, as the servaPt turned the lock&#xD;
~nd left rue a ])risoner, "~~llif Nita only knew that&#xD;
I~ too, was under lock and key she would fad better,&#xD;
{br 'misery loves company.'" A.s I was thus musing,&#xD;
and wondering in what apartment the child could be,&#xD;
I heard a low, choked sob from the next room. I went&#xD;
straight to the keyhold and listened. Again I heard&#xD;
another. "Nita!" I whispered, putting my mouth&#xD;
to the keyhole.; "Nita! arc you there ~?" but no&#xD;
answer. "Nita!" I said,' in a louder voice, "come&#xD;
here, if you are there " but again no answer. "It is&#xD;
only I, only John." I heard a soft movement and&#xD;
a few light footsteps, and the little girl's eye was peep-&#xD;
ing at me. "Oh, John, are you there? what macic&#xD;
theni lock you up, you were not to blame ~? I'm so&#xD;
sorry, and glad, too, for I was afraid to think of being&#xD;

"\7es, keep in good spirits," I returned; "for I will&#xD;
tell you a story and we won't mind being locked up."&#xD;
So down we sat, she in one room and I in the other,&#xD;
both in disgrace, but both ,of us happy for all that, for&#xD;
she was naturally cheerful, and soon forgot her troubles;&#xD;

CHAPTER YJ.&#xD;

JollY IS FULL GROWN".&#xD;

DO not intend to linger over Nita's and my&#xD;
thonoli itwasb&#xD;
eIlih:hoo(1,           ~ far the hal)l)iest&#xD;
~c~~portion of my long, weary life. I was a&#xD;
happy, Joyous boy then, but now a sad,&#xD;
sorrowful man. I could, if I did not have coni-&#xD;
passion on my readers, relate event after ev~nt of&#xD;
pleasure which happened in my boyhood to little Nita&#xD;
and myself. There were, too, hours of sadness am:id&#xD;
disgrace for both of us; but our troubles were of short&#xD;
duration, for if we were locked up for some trivial&#xD;
offemise, which was frequently the case, since Eleanor&#xD;
never tired of misrepresentingg us,'just allow us to peep&#xD;
at each other through the keyhole or some window a~d&#xD;
we were happy, and took our punishment with th~ best&#xD;
l)OSSible grace.&#xD;
I am. very much afraid, my friends, by the time you&#xD;
have read to this chapter, you will have beco e very&#xD;
tired of the joys and sorrows of two children, and will&#xD;
hmavesaid with much irritation, "I do wish John and&#xD;
Nita would grow up. We have had quite enough of&#xD;
them." So, in compliment to you, though it is with a&#xD;
"feeling akin to pain7' I pass over a period of 'seven&#xD;
years, which made me a man aiid Nita a woman, and,&#xD;
oh! such a fair graceful woman. Her light figure li-ad&#xD;
lost none of that ease and swiftness of motion, blended&#xD;
with the most perfect grace, that was peculiar to her&#xD;
alone; and her lovely eyes, so soft and expressive, lit-'&#xD;

rally spoke every emotion of her heart. It would he&#xD;
folly for me to say that there were none as lovely as&#xD;
Nita. I do not intend going so far. She was lovelier&#xD;
than any one else in the workl to me, though others dif-'&#xD;
fered from me very often. She ~vas, ho~vever, admired&#xD;
extravagantly rind loved by all, and thought much more&#xD;
attractive and inningn, although not as beautiful as&#xD;
Lady Eleanor. I once heard an English Countess&#xD;
remark that she would willingly give her rich estates&#xD;
for Nita Graham's eyes, and did she but possess them,&#xD;
she could and would make the whole world bow before&#xD;
her; and on the same evening, a gentleman said to me:&#xD;
"That little cousin of yours is exceedingly lovely,&#xD;
though one must kno'v her before he can fully appre-'&#xD;
ciat~ h~r beauty. Her face, at first, does not strike you&#xD;
as being so beautiful as Lady Eleanor's, but after a few&#xD;
moments' conversation you quite change your mind.&#xD;
I never saw eyes that so mirrored one's heart." And&#xD;
such remarks I was continually hearing. Eleanor took&#xD;
good care that Nita sho'ild see as little of society as&#xD;
possible when her vanity allowed her to notice the&#xD;
effect she produced.&#xD;
But the time came at length when iNita must make&#xD;
her appearance in public.&#xD;
"Nita is quitQ old e~noughi," Sir Cla~cnce remarked,&#xD;
when the question was discussed, "and a very sweet,&#xD;
pretty little girl she is, too. Yes, she must make her&#xD;
debut this fall; that's settled."&#xD;
When her father spoke so posi~tively, Eleanor could&#xD;
only pout her ~)retty lips and remain silent. I think I&#xD;
mentioned that Eleanor inherited a large estate at her&#xD;

mother's death; which brought her annually a largc&#xD;
income. But this great aliount wa~ scarcely sufficient&#xD;
to satisfy~her demands. Poor Nita never saw a cent of&#xD;
it, and was dependent upon her father's generosity for&#xD;
the little orna:ncnts she owned. One evening' T over-&#xD;
heard her remark to, her waiting-maid&#xD;
"I'n1 sure, Charlotte, when I (10 go to Lady A- 's&#xD;
ball (thi~ was to be Nita's ball) I will feel mighty&#xD;
shabby. I won't look at all like a nobleman's daugh-&#xD;
ter, and Madam Blanche seems to think my wardrobe&#xD;
quite good enough for mc~. Why, I have iiot a suitable&#xD;
set of jewelry even, and I, wouldn't ask papa, for he&#xD;
has been so generous to me lately that I fear he, would&#xD;
think my wants will never be supplied. I am sure I&#xD;
will feel very badly. 'But what can't be cured must&#xD;
be endured,' " antI she commenced humming an air,&#xD;
seeming to forget fn an instant her difficulties.&#xD;
I went down stairs muttering, "Oh, this is the way,&#xD;
is it? Well, it shan't be so always."&#xD;
I had a call to London a week before the ball. on&#xD;
pressing business. After rhy engagement was concln-&#xD;
dccl, I found myself in the great city with nothing to&#xD;
do but to, think of Nita. ,And as I walked down the&#xD;
busy streets, I remembered That I had heard her sPeak&#xD;
of not having a suitable set of jewelry for the ball.&#xD;
My eyes wandered from store to store~ until at length&#xD;
11 saw the one I most wished for. I entered; the&#xD;
1)rio'htest gems were before ~ uy~; for a I uut~ i was&#xD;
:.~ r&#xD;
almost dazzled by the brilliance of the precious stones;&#xD;
but finally remembering how limited my sta)T was to&#xD;

OI~, RETRIBUTION.&#xD;

&#xD;
would be acceptable 'to Nita, and shortly after bade adieu&#xD;
to Merry lEngland and was sailing across the Channel.&#xD;
I found Nita, on my arrival, in the conservatory,&#xD;
watering a row of Nile lilies which she claimed as her&#xD;
special property. She did not hear my footsteps, and&#xD;
my arms were around her before she was aware of my&#xD;
l)rescnce.&#xD;
"Oh, I am. so glad, so very glad, you have come,&#xD;
John! I hav~ been real lonesome. You don't know&#xD;
what a difference your absence makes~ It don't seem&#xD;
like home without you."&#xD;
A thrill of exquisite joy passed through me at these&#xD;
words, ~nd as I saw truth written in every lineament&#xD;
of her lovely face, my heart throbbed with a pleasun~&#xD;
that I never felt before.&#xD;
"And you really missed,1me, Nita? Why, I didit't&#xD;
thihk you would notice my absence."&#xD;
"Oh, you 01(1 hoax," she answered, laughing, "you&#xD;
know very well I missed you. Aint you just as good&#xD;
as you can be, and who thinks of giving me one&#xD;
moment's pleasure but you?"&#xD;
She turned away her head to hide a tear that was&#xD;
glistening on her cheek, as She felt the truth of these&#xD;
last words.&#xD;
"After awhile, Nita, you won't think so much of&#xD;
me. You will, be in other company, and theN will be&#xD;
new scenes and new faces to divert you, whilst I'll be&#xD;
here alone, sadly wishing that the time had never&#xD;
come when others could give you pleastni'e and when&#xD;
you would not look to me for every enjoyment."&#xD;
"What do you mean?" she said, very much startled,&#xD;
"Am I going anywhere that I won't be with you?&#xD;

"No, '1 answered, "but you are going into fashion-&#xD;
able society, where you will 'be flattered and caressed,&#xD;
and by some loved; but there will be others, Nita, who&#xD;
will frown upon you, and jealousies will arise that will&#xD;
make your life almost unbearable; but then, again,&#xD;
there will be an excitement which you will relish and&#xD;
which you will not be willing to relinquish for the&#xD;
quiet joys of home."&#xD;
~&#xD;

gloomily of this life that I am doonwd to lead. I'm&#xD;
sure it will nof be so dreadful. Speak more, eheeringly&#xD;
for pity sake, or I will despair of ever having a peace-&#xD;

"Oh, I trust it won~t be quite as' bad as that; but&#xD;
experience is the best of masters."&#xD;
We. had been walking while we were speaking, and&#xD;
had entered thc parlor just as I had finished my last&#xD;
speech.&#xD;
"No~v," I Said, "give me one more little ballad&#xD;
while we arc here alone, for next week )ou will be lit-&#xD;
tle, with me, and whilst you are away will forget how&#xD;
dearly I love to hear you sing."&#xD;
"I will never forget either your likes or dislikes,"&#xD;
she answered, as she seated herself at the instrument&#xD;
and began a low, simple melody.&#xD;
When she had finished, she turned to inc and said:&#xD;
'KJohn, how can you say that I will forget you? you&#xD;
who have ever been my best friend. jYou know my&#xD;
life would have been a poor, lonely one if it had not&#xD;
been for you; and you to say I will forget you! I&#xD;

"Neither have I forgotten you, my little cousin," I&#xD;
said, as I laid the sparkling jewels before her. "This&#xD;
you will accept as a little token of my remembrance."&#xD;
"0! are these for me?" lifting the beautiful stones&#xD;
from the soft ye] v&amp;amp; and looking at them more closely.&#xD;
"Oh, these are lovel, m~ignificent! John, did you get&#xD;
these for me? and did you think of me whilst you&#xD;
~~~ere in 01(1, bustling London?"&#xD;
'~ Indeed, I did-there and everywhere."&#xD;
"Well, what shall I say to thank you?" she asked,&#xD;
looking up into my eyes.&#xD;
"Not a word," stooping an4 kissing the blushing&#xD;
cheek, "not a word; only wear them for my sake at&#xD;
Countess A~'s ball."&#xD;
"Yes, indeed, that I shall; but you ask little return&#xD;
for such a superb present. I want to do more for you.&#xD;
What shall it be?"&#xD;
"That is all I ask now, dear Nita," I answered,&#xD;
'~ though perhaps in the future I shall be more extrav-&#xD;
agant in my requests."&#xD;
"You are a dear, (lear cousin," she whispered, "and&#xD;
you can never ask too much of me or more than I will&#xD;
be willing to do," an&amp;amp; throwing her arms around my&#xD;
neck in the old childish way, she told me again that I&#xD;
was her dearest friend.&#xD;
Oh, if I cohld only have claimed her then! flut&#xD;
no, no. It was ordained otherwise, and I try to believe&#xD;
that it was for the best, and that our Creator knoweth&#xD;
what is for our good, aiid dealeth most mercifully with&#xD;

Why, John, you arc sighing, whilst I am so happy.&#xD;
Why, what is the matter?"&#xD;
"Here, while 117 am with you, dear Nita, you aro suf~&#xD;

house, though he does think me such a trouble? And&#xD;
Eleanor, maybe, would be repentant for not letting papa&#xD;
love mc as much as he does her. You are the only&#xD;
one that* I know would be sorry," coming up to me&#xD;
and laying her hand on my arm, "and my greatest&#xD;
regret would be to leave you, John."&#xD;
I turned away and left the rooip, for the bare thought&#xD;
of losing her sent a bitter sorrow to my heart's core.&#xD;
&#xD;
LIE long lOOke(l for, and much talked of;&#xD;
night of' the ball at length arrived, when&#xD;
Nita was to make her debut. For the whole&#xD;
day preceding it, everything was in the&#xD;
utmost confusion. I could not catch a glimpse of&#xD;
the young lady till towards evening, when I was&#xD;
fortunate enough to see her long enough to ask&#xD;
what dress she would wear on the great occasion.&#xD;
"Oh! the drcss papa gave me-white silk with your&#xD;
emeralds, (10 you think I will look pretty?"&#xD;
"Lovely ! " I said1, in return.&#xD;
"Well good-bye, until you see me looking so," she&#xD;
answered, as she ran lightly away, "then you can pay&#xD;
rn ~ as many complimci~ts as you l)lease, for I will have&#xD;
ti tue to listen."&#xD;
In the evening, at half-past nine, we were to start&#xD;
fc r Countess A's, where a large ~tnd select party were&#xD;
ili.Vite(1 to receive Niki. It was quite dark when the&#xD;
two girls came down to get into the carriage. I&#xD;
noticed that Nita, though I could not sec her face, was&#xD;
sad and very silent. I did not ask the cause think-&#xD;
ing perhaps that the novelty of the occasion alarmed&#xD;
her, and, without having spoken half a (lozen words,&#xD;
we arrived at the Countess', where introductions, and&#xD;
little ceremonies too numerous to mention, were gone&#xD;
through with. My two cousins, on the arms of my&#xD;
Lords, whose names I have long since forgotten, were&#xD;

ushered into the great hall. Murmurs of admiration&#xD;
greeted these lovely girls on every side, and their&#xD;
entirely different styles attracted universal attention.&#xD;
I soon saw my little Nita in the gay dance, with a&#xD;
crowd of admirers flocking aro~ind her. I was hurt&#xD;
and vexed when Ii saw that my presei~t was discarded,&#xD;
for she did ijot wear the jewels I had thought so much&#xD;
of; and which would have made her look so attractive.&#xD;
Whilst wondering why this was, I acchkntally caught&#xD;
sight of them in a brilliant blaze of light on the neck&#xD;
and arms of Eleanor; and how beautiful they were,&#xD;
and how lovely they made~er appear. I, had never&#xD;
seen her half so lovely as she was this night. I was&#xD;
so much worried for a while, that Iii ceased to look&#xD;
towards either of my cousins, and tried to forget them&#xD;
entirely, as I sa~v they had no need of a' faithful&#xD;
watcher. I soon left the crowded hail and went to&#xD;
one of the verandas, and seating myself; thought of the&#xD;
injustice practiced upon me by Kita. I felt it very&#xD;
keenly, and was fast making myself vei'y miserable,&#xD;
when I was touched on my arm. Looking up, I saw&#xD;
his hi.&#xD;
a young gentleman, who, in irry, forgot to intro-&#xD;
duce himself; but who seemed to be well acquainted&#xD;
with me.&#xD;
"Mr. Meredith, please introduce me to your younger&#xD;
cousin, she is so bewitchingly beautiful."&#xD;
"If you ~will honor inc with your name, sir,, I will&#xD;
do so," Ii answered, coldly.&#xD;
"OhJ beg you will excuse me," he answered," your&#xD;
lovely relative has made me quite forget my politeness.&#xD;
Arriving after your party, I was denied the pleasure&#xD;
pf beir~ one of the first who~ were introduced."&#xD;

Pleased with the address of-This young ma-n, I arose&#xD;
instantly after hearing his name, and accompanied him&#xD;
to the dancing saloon. Ii found Nita with several gen~&#xD;
ticinen who were all requesting the l)leaslll'e of a set&#xD;
with her. She saw me advancing' 'md came forward&#xD;
a few steps to meet me. I introduced Sir Charles&#xD;
Stuart, and in a few moments left him talking to Nita&#xD;
in a mhnner which was altogether very ~epos~sing&#xD;
and attractive. I went back again to my lonely seat on&#xD;
the veranda, continuing my dispiriting wondering why&#xD;
N~ta should have treated me thus, an(l thinking of the&#xD;
handsome young Scotch man I had just prCsCl)ted to&#xD;
her. All seemed so dark to me then, that with a&#xD;
weary yearning, 1 longed for my boyhood to come&#xD;
again, when she was all my own. Ii shuddered as I&#xD;
looked to the future, and ~felt what it had in store for&#xD;
me. As I ~at thus' musing, Nita and Sir Charles&#xD;
passel out and joined a throng of promenaders on tI e&#xD;
balcony. A thrill of jealousy shot through me, an(l&#xD;
* when I saw by the moonlight the bright, lu stromis eyes&#xD;
looking into his, and the soft smile wreathing her lips,&#xD;
I determined to bear it no lono'er. Remembering that&#xD;
my cousin had warned rue not to stay out late, but to&#xD;
let corn muon sense make me come early, I looked at my&#xD;
watch, and finding it long after miclnio'ht started to&#xD;
b&#xD;
seek Eleanor, to suggest to her that we had better&#xD;
leave. Of ~c~urse, she was the one to say Yes or No to&#xD;
our going. I found her almost alone, and was pleased&#xD;
to see by her tired look that she would be willing to&#xD;
depart. She had not received the usual amount of&#xD;
attention that was generally allotted her, the "little&#xD;

is Nita?" she asked; "call her, if you please, and we&#xD;
will go.'U This was soon (lone, for F did 'not like to&#xD;
see Nita wi~1i this gentleman. I felt a presentiment&#xD;
of coming evil when I thought of those two together.&#xD;
We were not long in. preparing and were soon on our&#xD;
way home. Nita talked all the time of how charm.&#xD;
Sir Stuwt 'md&#xD;
ingly she spent the evening, an(l of    ,    tol(l&#xD;
US that she hati 1)rGmiSed to allow imini to visit her.&#xD;
This was a new pa in, for I wa~ very Jealous of this Sir&#xD;
Charles, whose gentlenma nly mapnei's and agreeable&#xD;
appearance were so striking. I had only known hin&#xD;
two or three hours, and was, in troth, obliged '&#xD;
acknowledge that he was the most at tractive gent I ~-&#xD;
man, I had ever met.&#xD;
"What. did you think of him, iBleamior? "&#xD;
"I (lid not have the pleasure of an introduction, Ii it&#xD;
as you ~eem to think so, I suppose he must be over-&#xD;
poweringly fascinating."&#xD;
So6n after this scornful speech, we reached home,&#xD;
and for the first time since I had come to live under&#xD;
my COUSi n's roof; I retired to my chamber without&#xD;
kissing Nita good night. In a little while Sir ,~lar-&#xD;
ence came in to learn tl~e events 6f the evening. I&#xD;
told him all about the ball, anti could.~ not help men-&#xD;
tioning that Nita had di~earded the jewels she had&#xD;
£&#xD;
promised to wear, and that they were very becoming&#xD;
to Eleanor.&#xD;
No doubt he saw that I Was deeply hurt, for at the&#xD;
br~ akfast table, next morning, after telling his younger&#xD;
child how proud he was of her (all parents are proud&#xD;
&#xD;
of their cli ildren if 1y the world admired, and so it was&#xD;
with my cousin), asked;&#xD;
"What did my little Italitin wear that macic her so&#xD;
captiVatin~ 'p"&#xD;
Eleanor had always managed it so that Sir Clarence&#xD;
sfmoukl be blind to Nita's zuany ah~irms; Jrnw she did&#xD;
this, I never knew, but, strange to say, it was true.&#xD;
My cousin seemed to be under the impression that&#xD;
Nita was admired by no one, but this ball had the&#xD;
effect of opening his eyes.&#xD;
"What did I wear, papa? Why, of course, the&#xD;
beautiful white silk you gave me, and your pretty&#xD;
bracelets."&#xD;
"Was that all the jewelry? You were certainly&#xD;
modest."&#xD;
No," she said, blushing, and evidently much embar-&#xD;
rassed, "I wore a set of corals."&#xD;
"Why," asked Sir Clarence, rather severely, "did&#xD;
you not wear the set of emeralds that John was kind&#xD;
enough to give you?&#xD;
"Because," she stammered, and then stopped.&#xD;
"Because, what?" l)ersisted the father.&#xD;
I saw then what he meant, and felt sorry for her,&#xD;
and ren~arked that I supposed that Nita thought they&#xD;
were more l)ecomi ng to Eleanor than to herself; and&#xD;
was too unselfish nQt to allow her to wear them. I&#xD;
~aw the blood start into Eleanor's naturally pale face&#xD;
as I said this, mA she gave me one of her old looks,&#xD;
which used to alarm me when I was a boy, and I saw&#xD;
that she was very inuich frightened for fear her father&#xD;
would think that she had been capable of a mean&#xD;

noticing this silent confession, sai(l&#xD;
",~Why did you not let Nita wear her own&#xD;
Eleanor?"&#xD;
" Mhy, papa, I (lidil't think they would be a;&#xD;
beconiiiig as the set of corals. You have already&#xD;
h~'ard how much she was admired, ai~l I think it was&#xD;
Owing altogether to my good taste in lending her the&#xD;
coral set."&#xD;
2      " \Ydl then " I said, anxious to get my mind&#xD;
relieved, "Eleanor, you just took Nita's jewels 011(1 IV it&#xD;
your's in their place without saying anything?"&#xD;
Yes, I did," she answer d~ 1)ettishly ; "is it am y&#xD;

None, whatever," I replied ; "only you put me n&#xD;

his valise marked with the eight of clubs, and anoth~ ~r&#xD;

She said no more, for her Kither \vas present, ai~ d&#xD;
before him she was always ~amiable. We wero sile~ it&#xD;

a few questions relative to the ball. After we had risen&#xD;

w&#xD;
"Oh " she answered, "a nice row on the river, and&#xD;
a soiree ~t Lady C's this~ evening. Oh! I think it&#xD;

"isn't Sir Charles chtirming?"&#xD;
I couki scarcely bear to hear this man praised in my&#xD;

"It is very likely I will not, Elcanor. I have busi-&#xD;

at hqme, U iinl~ing how miserable my life was becoming,&#xD;
and wondering why did girls 1)CCOn~e women, and why&#xD;
didn't we always st~iy children. I was wondering all&#xD;
this, when Patrick, who was dusting the furiiiture in&#xD;
my room, turned to nke, and asked&#xD;
"Were you the person, Masther, who introduced my&#xD;
young Misthr~ss Nita to Sir Charles Stuart'?"&#xD;
"Yes," I said, looking at him in surprise, "why do&#xD;
~ou ask?"                                    2&#xD;
"Because," lie began, "Sir Clarence is very much&#xD;

tioned last evening. There seems that there has been&#xD;
some misunderstanding' between Sir Clarence and this&#xD;
Stuart family, and, whatever it was, Sir Clarence is&#xD;
seriously displeased."&#xD;
This raised my spirits wonderfully. I felt like a&#xD;
new man. Perhaps, after all, I was hidulging in&#xD;
imaginary trouble that would never be realized. I&#xD;
arose, whistling, wi di a lighter heart than I had had&#xD;
siuco Nita's debut was first spoken of. I met my cou-&#xD;

it would be more acceptable for me to see a. woolly~&#xD;

"I am sure Sir Charles" (feeling sorry for him when&#xD;
I heard him unjustly spoken of) "' is quite a gentleman,&#xD;
and I never have seen a more fascination~ one."&#xD;
"iFascinating! That is just it," he said, interrupt-&#xD;

1)re~1Itly, and theii wp will have nice acting."&#xD;
"God forbid," It murmured to myself; and left the&#xD;
excited old man to calm himself. Sir Clarence's ~vord~&#xD;
were prophetic,' for every day I was convinced that she&#xD;
was more and more enaniored of this young stranger,&#xD;
although she had been told of her father's objection to&#xD;
him. This dislike on Sir Claren&amp;amp;e's part did not scum a&#xD;
sufficient reason for her refusing to give him her love.&#xD;
I heard afterwards that it was a very little thing which&#xD;
~had made the breech between the two families.&#xD;
On~ day when a party of~cquestrians had returned&#xD;
from their ride, Nita being amongst them, I saw Sir&#xD;
Charles, as he lifted her from the saddle, place a tiiiy&#xD;
white rose-bud in her hand, and whisper, "With the&#xD;
emblem." She blushed deeply as she received it, and&#xD;
I saw her kiss it in suhicl~ a tender manner on her way&#xD;

"I am almost afraid to tell you for fear the flowers&#xD;

I knew wh~.t it was, b ut said nothing.&#xD;
"I must tell you though," she continued. "I would&#xD;

Yes, I knew he would suffer, for it did not take me&#xD;

After a long silence ~he spolie~ again&#xD;
"John, you will do all you can for me, won't you?&#xD;

I walked alone in the dini starlight after she had left&#xD;

me mad. I knew that I could stop ~Sir Charles f~om&#xD;

make known to Sir Clarence what I had j ust heard and&#xD;
agree with him in disapproving of it. Then Nita&#xD;
~vould be forever separated from this man, who stood&#xD;
between me ai~d all*~ that this world had of happiness&#xD;

&#xD;
TER this the days crept slowly eno~ughI.&#xD;
dark heavy cloud seemed to have lowerc(l&#xD;
_overus all, which affected Nita very seriously.&#xD;
I had spoken to Sir Clarence, and told hum&#xD;
01' Nit&amp;amp;s preference, and 1)0w worthily I thought&#xD;
it was l)estowecl; but all I could say would get&#xD;
from him but the pei~mission for the young lovers&#xD;
to see each other occasionally; more luau this he&#xD;
(leclareci should never l)e; and when I tried to&#xD;
cojivince that he was both hard and unjust to&#xD;
these young people, he hushed mc with a cold rebuke,&#xD;
and very unceremoniously dismissed me from his pres-&#xD;
ence. But a~ days passed on, and I sa~v Nita's cheek&#xD;
grow pale and thin, her ligJit step heavy, and her large,&#xD;
lustrous eyes lose their brightness, my conscience&#xD;
reproached me, and I feared that I had not done all&#xD;
for her that I could. I was becoming very scrupulous&#xD;
on this point, and determined that I w&amp;amp;uld light a hard&#xD;
fight in her interest. *What hurt me most was that she&#xD;
seem&amp;amp;l to avoid me and all the family. I had seen less&#xD;
of her in the last two weeks than I had done for years.&#xD;
I could hardly stand this. I loved her so that I would&#xD;
rather suffer anything than she should suspect inc of&#xD;
not befriending her. Sometimes, in passing her chain-&#xD;
ber at night, I would hear her, in soft tones, supplicat-&#xD;
ing mercy from on high. One evening I was walking&#xD;

d5 usual was trying to forget myself and soften the&#xD;
burthen that was upon me. I had walked some&#xD;
lance to where two or three jarge willows hung their&#xD;
huge branches over the bright waters. Underneath&#xD;
their coo' sha(le I thought to rest and refresh myself&#xD;
from the burning .rays of the afternoon sun In the&#xD;
act of doing so I was stopped by the notes of a guitar,&#xD;
accompanied by Nita's iow, musical Voice, invoking the&#xD;
Blessed \irgin in the evening hymn. I stood where&#xD;
th~ drooping branches concealed me from view, but where&#xD;
I eQuld see her, with her soft eyes raised supplicatingly&#xD;
to Heaven and those l)ul'e notes bursting' forth from&#xD;
her lips. I thought I had never seen a more attrac-&#xD;
live or beautiful l)ictllre. After the hymn ceased,~&#xD;
she leaned forward, with her chin resting on her&#xD;
hand, an (I looked pensively over the waters. iTo~&#xD;
much she was like the Portrait of her mother then ! I&#xD;
was half afraid of approadiing her for fear' of being&#xD;
repulsed, and as I stood thoughtfully studying whether&#xD;
to a(lvance or not I saw Sir Charles, with hi~ rod and&#xD;
line, perhaps like myself seeking, by wandering along&#xD;
the river, to lighten ~hiis grief, lie soon saw Nita,&#xD;
though she was entirely unconscious of Ins presence,.&#xD;
He stopped, as I had done, to gaz6 upon the lovely pie-.&#xD;
ture, and, like me, was completely enraptured. , The&#xD;
pure love he had for 'the woman sitting there beamed&#xD;
forth from his expressive countenance and shone in his&#xD;
dark gray eyes. He came up and sat down by her.&#xD;
She started and gave a cry ofjoyous recognition. How&#xD;
I stood that half hour and looked at those two I never&#xD;
,eouid tell, thoiio'h I have asked myself again and&#xD;

again. IlIad I thought of myself I would have gone&#xD;
away, but I thought of nothing but of the lovers before&#xD;
me ~iiuI of what I liear(l them say.&#xD;
"Oh Ch~rle~           " she        " IT'tw you&#xD;

" Then there is no good news? You need iiot&#xD;

is it that our cup of bitterness niust be so full? But&#xD;
I will not give on up, he continued. "Never&#xD;

lie cannot hold out always. And why. shoul(l lie&#xD;

beloved child, and I who have never donC him harm,&#xD;
save to love his daughter so much, more than life?&#xD;

I don't know, Charles," she answered in tones in&#xD;
which grief was visible; " I don't know. I suppose&#xD;
I will (lie some day, and then they will feel sorry that&#xD;
they did not grant the only M~iLh~of my heart. Oh,&#xD;
Charles, they hive never loved mp as you (10."&#xD;
" They! " " They!" Then I, of course, was inein-&#xD;
(led-I that would have willingly laid down my life to&#xD;
have made her happy. But still she included me with&#xD;
the rest. I made a solemn ~ow then and there that&#xD;
she should marry this man, no matter what it cost me&#xD;
-and she continued. "I will never marry anyone&#xD;
but you, Charles ; they cannot make mc do that, and I&#xD;
can never love anyone agahi."&#xD;

those sweet brown eyes closed forever more than know&#xD;
that they would look with love in another face ; they&#xD;
must be mine! ~dne to look at and grow. cheerful in&#xD;
their brightness; mine, when the cold world has dealt&#xD;

through life, an(l mine after, I trust, 'Li a blissful&#xD;

"Yes, always yours," she murmure(1 ; " always,&#xD;
always."&#xD;
I turned away, then, very sad and lonely, and ~vent&#xD;
back and sat upon the veranda, waitiimg, waiting, wait-&#xD;
ing, for what? I hardly knew. At last Nita came;&#xD;
the rose was then upon her cheek and the 1)rightness&#xD;
in her eyes. After all,, the meeting must have 'been a&#xD;
joyous an(l happy one, though they were like children&#xD;
groping in the dark, nut knowing where they were&#xD;
going or what they would do next. I rose as she came&#xD;
and went t9 her.&#xD;
"Nita," II said, " will you come with mc'? I wou!d&#xD;
like to speak to you."&#xD;
"Is it of importance?" she asked; "if not, I would&#xD;
rather you would put it off until to-morrow, as I wish&#xD;
to go 'to my room now."&#xD;
"As you like," I answered, and turned away in&#xD;
search of Sir Clarence, and found liin in his study&#xD;
hard at work on sonic papers.&#xD;
" I wish you would come here and help, John. I&#xD;
am up to my eyes in work, and don't know what 1&#xD;
shall do unless you lend me your valuable assistance."&#xD;
I was soon at work with him, a~id we were not long&#xD;

Finished, I looked at Sir (larence afl(l S~W that he W..is&#xD;
in an excellent luimor, and felt that' this was the time&#xD;
to speak.&#xD;
"Sir Clarence, 1 began, '' I wish to speak to you&#xD;

I/a1ia~. I think that every parent should establish&#xD;
his child's happiness when it is within his reach. And&#xD;
the question arises now: Will you, Sir Clarence, make&#xD;
your child happy or cause her young heart to break&#xD;
through an UUJ imst ~ ad ice'? Fur there is no man&#xD;
more to b6 admired than this Sir Charles, ai~~ if you&#xD;
would yiew this m4ter frou~ an impartial point, you&#xD;
would see at once how wrong it was to vi~it 'the doings&#xD;
of their forefathers upon this young couple."&#xD;
He did not interrupt inc whilst I was speaking, but&#xD;
looked out the window at the trees, WIII('hL were floddimig&#xD;

jug fii~t and bard to keep them in their place. A &amp;amp;ei'&#xD;
~t1l imeOulfOrtable pause, he turned abruptly to mc an'l&#xD;
said&#xD;
" Why is it that you plead for Nita'? Are you si&#xD;
very anxioUS to get rid of her? "&#xD;
Anxious to get rid of her ! Was I anxious t~ tear&#xD;
the ~iinshiiie from 1'flY heart .' AnXIOUS to turn (Lw&#xD;
iflt() everlasting fli('ht&#xD;
0&#xD;
" No, Sir Clarence," I sai(l when I could master my'I&#xD;
fi'cli~gs, " I am only anxious &amp;amp;r her happiness, and I&#xD;
J)elleYe that this is the only way it can be obtained.&#xD;
"V/eli, then, he aflSWere(l, " if she loves this ~eoteh-&#xD;
man better than her silvery-headed father, let her go&#xD;
with him, but she is never to come back to me a~'aiu.&#xD;
Tell her this, and tell her that she can have her mar-&#xD;
riage here, where you and Eleanor can witness it. But&#xD;
after that, she goes. Not another \vord, John Mere-&#xD;
(lith. It is you that are sending my ehild away from&#xD;
me. Take my message to her, and tell her to decj(le&#xD;
between her lover and her father."&#xD;
It was useless to say more then, so I left him to look&#xD;
for Nita. I found her with Eleanor, which was&#xD;
something strange, something that had not happened&#xD;
for months, I may say years~ that these two sisters&#xD;
should have a confidential talk together. I begged&#xD;
pardon foriutrudiug upon them, and asked Nita if I&#xD;
could see her when she had finished.&#xD;
"W&amp;amp;.~ have finished now," said. Eleanor, rising, and I&#xD;
noticed that ~he had quite a siti~iietl look upon her&#xD;
lace, aUd spoke more cordially than was usual with her.&#xD;

When I had opened the door for Eleanor to leave,&#xD;

"I have something of, importance to say to )'Otl, 1it~&#xD;

confession on my part, and in accusing myself Ii am&#xD;

~ and Sir Charles were on the beach. II hope you are&#xD;
not angry and do not think me veVv (lislionorable, for&#xD;

I have had a conversation with Sir Clarence."&#xD;
"And told him all about it, I suppose," she e~&#xD;
claimed, springing up and casting a look of reproa~h&#xD;
upon me.&#xD;
I had hoped, Nita," I replied, "that in all these&#xD;
long ear~ you would have known me better. I had&#xD;
no desire, no reason, no thought, to make your inectiog&#xD;
known to your father."&#xD;
"Forgive me," she said, with tears in her eyes. "~ I&#xD;
was too hasty. It would have beeii s~ unkind for you&#xD;
to have told papa. But I ought to have known you&#xD;
would not."&#xD;
"No, I would not," I answered, hurt to the quick,&#xD;
"though I spoke to' your father of you, and he told&#xD;
me to tell you that you could marry Sir Charles-"&#xD;
"Oh! did he!" interrupting me, a~d throwing her&#xD;
arms round my neck in th~ old, old way. "Oh, John,&#xD;
you dear, dear cousin! You did this for me, and I&#xD;
have been so unkind to you lately."&#xD;
II took her ar\ms from my neck and ~walked away a&#xD;

She ~vas touched an(l grieved, but answereol promptly:&#xD;
" I have chos(Ii, John. I will take Sir Charles.&#xD;
Eleanor has Sai(l that she thought it ridiculous in me&#xD;
to hesitate at all, an(l that if sh&amp;amp; was in my plac&amp;amp;she&#xD;
would have iinarried him long ago.&#xD;
" Did she ? And she has been advising you?"&#xD;
"Oh, no," she answere(l, hurriedly, "not advising~&#xD;
me. She only told me what she would have done had&#xD;
she been in my ~&#xD;
"Very we11, Nita. Then I suppose you have decided&#xD;
aI)(l it'S all settled'?"&#xD;
"Yes, John, it's 41 settled, and the sooner we are&#xD;
married the better it will be for all of' us, I think.&#xD;
Perhaps papa  vill feel more lenient towards us when&#xD;
we are absent, and not visit his resentment upon poor&#xD;
Sir Charles and myself. You will never forget me,&#xD;
John, will you? When I am far away you must dAnk&#xD;
sometimes of me, as I will often of you, my more than&#xD;
cOusin, my brother."&#xD;
"1[ trust, my (lear Nita " I said interrupting her,&#xD;
"that you will remember me as your brother, and a&#xD;
very fond one too: and in trouble or in w~ant, it' you&#xD;

VK ~(4~! LIE marriage day caine at last. Sir Clarence&#xD;
never left his study during the week before&#xD;
Iti~&#xD;
but to conic to his meals, which were eaten&#xD;
in silence by all. Even the servants felt&#xD;
the grief which prece(les the departure of the loved&#xD;
One. VVe could not see that she would ever again&#xD;
come back to 115. ii ad the grave opened to receive&#xD;
her we could not have felt it more painfully;&#xD;
and still she was going and of her own free will. Oh,&#xD;
Love! what a mystery thou art, and what sacrifices&#xD;
are made for thee. Here was a young girl, with the&#xD;
stron(~est natural attachmentsywith a father she almost&#xD;
~vorshiped, with a home that was endeared to her by&#xD;
a thousand tender associations, willing, nay happy, to&#xD;
forego them all for a stranger she had scarce known&#xD;
three months. I did not close my eyes the night&#xD;
before the day which was to take all that was dearest&#xD;
in this world from me forcvcr~ I sat by the window&#xD;
and watched the stars as they rose, twinkled anti&#xD;
sparkled, and then I saw them slowly fade away before&#xD;
the bright rays of morn.&#xD;
~lie day, in the forenoon, was bright and cheering.&#xD;
The marriage was not to take place till the evening,&#xD;
anti the couple were to cross the Shannon at a point&#xD;
nearly opposite and go direct to Scotland, which wa~&#xD;
to be Nita's adopted country. As the last star had&#xD;

CiltUC iipcui iNita suddenly in a l)en(I iii 0110 of the&#xD;

had he 1)leS5C(( her nuptials ; but the paiii she suficred&#xD;
at the idea of his not being present was real llaj)piness&#xD;
to what came afterwards. We were called to all earlier&#xD;
breakfast than usual, the servants desiring this that&#xD;
they mi~lit spend as much of the day as possible with&#xD;
their beloved Mistress ; and Sir Clarence was a man&#xD;
that never refused a reasonable request. It seemed&#xD;
scarce an hour between morning and evening, so&#xD;
rapidly did the time fly ~vhich was to rob poor me and&#xD;
dIl the household of our darling, and cast ~a dark&#xD;
shadow over our lives which years might lighten but&#xD;
never could remove. I felt as though soin~ horrible&#xD;
nightmare had PO~eS~i0fl of me, and how I managed&#xD;
to give lwr away (which sad privilege devolved upon&#xD;
me~, and listened in silence to her phighting her vows&#xD;
to another nmn, I never could tell. Some invisible&#xD;
power seemed to be holding me up and encouraging&#xD;
&#xD;
me to go on If) the bitter end. it xva~ all soon over-&#xD;
it took only a Ibw minutes to separate her life from&#xD;
mine. She turned to inc l)ale and trembling, and a.~ I&#xD;
look her in my arms and kissed her, she whispered&#xD;
I wonder if papa will tell rue goo(l-bye, John ?&#xD;
Oh, if he only woul(l ! WI10 would kiss inc an(l tell me&#xD;
I hat lie is not So angry I would 1)0 so very, very happy.&#xD;
Conic with me, and ['II try, anyhow."&#xD;
II saw that she was flusllc(l with hope, and hoped,&#xD;
too, that 'Wlicii Sir Clarence saw her he would forgive.&#xD;
I opened the door softly for her to enter, and saw her&#xD;
father, with his face buried in his liaiids, leaning upon&#xD;
the tal)le. lie did not hear us enter, and starte(1 with.&#xD;

head, aid whispered&#xD;
"Iior(rive me, papa, and tell your poor child good.&#xD;

before I go."&#xD;
She looked so fondly and so pleadingly into his eyes&#xD;
that I had no other thought than thai he would for-&#xD;
give, and would not banish this gentle child forever&#xD;
from his home, but was sadly startled when he rose&#xD;
from his chair, with an expression of countenance that&#xD;
I never saw Sir Clarence wear before, and said. in a&#xD;
voice husky with passion&#xD;
"Go !" ~)0inting. to the door~ "you are no longer a&#xD;
child of mine! You ~forfeited that claim when von&#xD;
became the wife of Sir Charles Stuart. Go!" he&#xD;
repeated, opening the door by which she stood, pam-&#xD;

used every exertion in my power to do so, and I was&#xD;
considered an excellent horseman, but all my efforts in&#xD;
this case failed, afid I was thrown with s~di yiolenee&#xD;
that I hiecame, for a wh~lc, insensible. Eleawor's young&#xD;
j)OIW took "affrbrht and ran' off. I knew nothing oUthis,&#xD;
until returxuw~ to consciousness, I fbund she was not&#xD;
0&#xD;
&#xD;
a&#xD;
&#xD;
a-&#xD;
&#xD;
with me and that there was no trace of her to 1)0 seen.&#xD;
My own horse was standing near, quietly wrazmg on&#xD;
some fresh green grass which the slimmer rains caused&#xD;
to spring up all along the side of the hard road. I&#xD;
soon laid possession of him again awl was hurrying at&#xD;
an almost frantic rate frying to find poor Eleanor, whom&#xD;
I feared was killed or very badly hurt, when a little girl,&#xD;
who I saw through the rails of a cottage fence, told me&#xD;
Inc flint the young lady's horse had run off in that&#xD;
direction, pointing 10 the left, over a rich green mea~&#xD;
dow, where sonic careless TK'rsonS had left the fence&#xD;
down. I rode as rapidly as my horse could go, fear-&#xD;
ing All the tune to come up with the poor girl, lest my&#xD;
'orst apprehen~~ions 5110111(1 be realized. I looked all&#xD;
over the large meadow but could see no one. At the&#xD;
opposite side to where It was I noticed a grove of oaks;&#xD;
to that I directed mx' animal. In a few moments I had&#xD;
almost reached it, and saw Eleanor's pony at the fur-&#xD;
ther end of the grove tj~d to one of the trees. This&#xD;
gave me some hope. I lumped off my horse, tied him&#xD;
in like manner, and began my M'areli. It was iist lono'&#xD;
until I caught sight of a man, on a little rustic bench&#xD;
near 1w, stooping over a form which I knew at once&#xD;
must be her's. I ran quickly forward, in. my anxiety&#xD;
and fear; the gentleman turned, as I advanced, and I&#xD;
saw liv tiic expression ot' his flee that he was very&#xD;
much troubled. I sprang forward anti looked at Elea-&#xD;
nor. She was perlectir unconscious , but not, IL thanked&#xD;
God, dead as I had expected.&#xD;
rfhe gentleman had one of her whit&amp;amp; arms in' his&#xD;

-he had been tlioughtfid enough to bleed her when&#xD;
he found her insensible.&#xD;
"It am truly thankful to you, sir," I said, address-&#xD;
ing him, " for your thoughtfulness and kindness in this&#xD;
unhappy affair. I was thrown myself just .before this&#xD;
young lady's horse ran oft and was unconscious of the&#xD;
occurrence when it happened."&#xD;
"I assure you," he replied, in a very courteous man-&#xD;
ner, "that II am not deservingg of thanks, for I consi(ler&#xD;
it a, great privilege to be allowed to serve SO beautiful&#xD;
a creature,' ~~i1itiflg to Eleanor, who was still insen-&#xD;
sible. " II K'~w the whole oeeurrence-your fall, too,&#xD;
which was a very severe one-and would have helped&#xD;
you had not this young lady's horse started off. I f 4-&#xD;
lowed her immediately, but it was impossible for me to&#xD;
get to her before she was thrown, though I trust ~ he&#xD;
is not badly hurt an(l that we may hope for a spec ly&#xD;
recovery.&#xD;
"God grant it ! " I. answered, while 1)athing her&#xD;
temples and fiwe with cool, clear water which' flowed&#xD;
in a little stream near the grove. I soon had the hap-&#xD;
piness of seeing her open her eyes. I leaned over her&#xD;
and asked "if she felt any pain."&#xD;
she sa'l(1 ~b but JoIm&#xD;
"No"                 ,     , wasn't it dreadful?&#xD;
I was sure that I was going to be killed. Wasn't it&#xD;
frorrid in your old horse to get frightened? my pony&#xD;
never moved, and would not have run off if you had&#xD;
not been thrown. Just think," shuddering, "how near&#xD;
II was to death. Oh, it frightens me so to think of it!&#xD;
Oh, it was horrible! horrible! John, don't it frighten&#xD;
you, too?"&#xD;
&#xD;
Of course, it does; but you must thank this kind&#xD;
gei~tleman, here," 1)cckoning him to me, "he has, 1'&#xD;
think, saved your life, Eleanor."&#xD;
" Let me thank him, then,'~ she cried, rising. Sbe&#xD;
thought, as she told me afterwards, that it was some&#xD;
1)oor Irishman whom I wished her to thank for saving'&#xD;
her life, and when she saw a (liguified, stylish-looking&#xD;
stranger, she was so taken l)y surprise that she could&#xD;
scarcely thank him at all.&#xD;
"I hope you are not suffering any, my Lady," sai(l&#xD;
the gentleman, in the polished, courteous manner III&#xD;
before noticed. "Your rail seemed very severe, and I&#xD;
feared would be a serious one. I am truly happy that&#xD;
my fears seem not to be well founded."&#xD;
".1 ani not suffering at all, and am most truly thank-&#xD;
ful to you, kind sir," said she, "for your timely assist-&#xD;
ance. I should like above all things to know the&#xD;
name of the gentleman to whom III am so indebted."&#xD;
I-Ic bowed gracefully, and introduced himself as&#xD;
Lord Gordon. We were no less courteous than he,&#xD;
and, in a few minutes we were all chatting' a~x&#xD;
like old acquaintances under the oaks. Eleanor quite&#xD;
revivc(l, and used all her arts and charms to captivate&#xD;
the English Lord, for such he told us he was. I&#xD;
leaned with my head against one of the great trees,&#xD;
thrown back as far as it could be, for it seemed to be&#xD;
ready to burst from the effects of my fall, and putting&#xD;
in a word now and then only to let theni know that I&#xD;
was thinking of them, but wishing, with all my heai't,&#xD;
that I was resting on my couch at home. Eleanor~&#xD;
after all, wa~ not so badly hurt as iuvself~ and now.&#xD;

I rode quickly up to him to tell him of the events&#xD;
~f the evening before the others camo up.&#xD;
"Sir Clarence," I Sai(l, " Eleanor an(l myself met&#xD;

from our horses, and this gentleman has very kindly&#xD;

"here, papa, thank Lord Gor(lOfl for saving your&#xD;
child's life," said 'Eleanor, riding up, "for which II&#xD;
kno~v you are gPateful ," she continued, laughing, and&#xD;
kissing him as he received her into his arms.&#xD;
"Let me first thank God and His Blessed Mother&#xD;
tl)at you are safe, my child," said Sir Clarence with&#xD;
some agitation, "and then I will thank this kind gen-&#xD;
Ucmaxi and hear how it all happened." Tie paused for&#xD;
a fbw moments and uncovered his head whilst he made&#xD;
hit; thanksgiving, and we all involuntarily bowed also&#xD;
in humble acknowledgment of the great favor vouch-&#xD;
sa: 'ed us from on high, and of the goodness and patience&#xD;
of our Heavenly Father to his poor, weak, erring&#xD;
children. Sir Clarence then gave Lord Gordon his&#xD;
hand, thanked huu in a niost cordial manner~ and&#xD;
insisted upon his remaining under his always hospit-&#xD;

was only too pleased to do. The evening passed off&#xD;

I had escaped. Eleanor played and sang several songs&#xD;
from the most fashionable operas, which had the elThct&#xD;

K~~~NOTflER year had ~asscd, with its joys and&#xD;
its sorrows for all the worl(l ; marriage and&#xD;
given ifl marriage; the reaper death had been&#xD;
_________ as busy as of yore, mowing down the young&#xD;
and the old ; but the world went rOufl(I still ; the sun&#xD;
shone as bright in summer and as dull in winter; the&#xD;
flowers bloomed as sweetly in~ the spring and the leaves&#xD;
fell as lightly in he autunin, as if no vows for weal or&#xD;
woe 1)a(l been irr~\voeahly taken, or no souls launched&#xD;
into eternity to be forever happy or forever miserable. I&#xD;
had heard from Nita several times, her letters all breath-&#xD;
ing the deep, pure love she cherished for her husband-&#xD;
all telling of his many noble cjualities and of his strong&#xD;
affection for her. She seemed very happy, loving and&#xD;
being beloved by him. But every cup of happiness&#xD;
must have its poison drop, and the one in Nita's was&#xD;
the continued anger of her father towards her. He&#xD;
still obstinately refused to become reconciled to his&#xD;
"erring one," as he chose to call her. He would not&#xD;
allow her name to be mentioned whe~c he was, and that&#xD;
loved name seemed to be entirely blotted out from that&#xD;
old mansion, and perhaps her image from the hearts of&#xD;
some-for nothing is easier than to forget-but in mine&#xD;
her ineniory was as fresh as those white roses near me,&#xD;
which, being just freed from their crystal dew drops,&#xD;
are looking up to the sun in all their beauty, purity,&#xD;
and youth.&#xD;

0R~ RETRIBUTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
Elcanor had nianag&amp;amp;l it so that the poor child was&#xD;
cut off without a farthing. She urged Nita to get mar-&#xD;
ned, and whilst doino' so pretended take his views of&#xD;
to&#xD;
the matte~', and al)~)ca1'ed to Ii im to be very much grieved&#xD;
at Nita's disobedience, as she called her nlarriao'e. when&#xD;
speaking to S;r Clarence. I djd not timid this out for&#xD;
some time, and directly Ii did s~ I went to my cousin&#xD;
to try to open his eyes to the deception that was prac-&#xD;
ticed upon him. He silenced inc instantly, asking me&#xD;
if I thought that I or any other man or woman could&#xD;
make him think that his child, who had chosen him&#xD;
before all on earth, cot be capable of it meanness, and,&#xD;
as I knew, had all her life been respectfull, (lutiful ,and&#xD;
submissive to him as it was possible for child to be.&#xD;
It was certainly neither my wish nor intention to&#xD;
~ prejuc1i~e this~doatLiig father against the daughter if at&#xD;
he had such unbounded confidence in; and I believed,&#xD;
too, that Eleanor did love him after a fashion ; but it&#xD;
was hard foi me to keej) from telling him that it was&#xD;
avarice,     tj&amp;amp;ttion, which made her apparently so&#xD;
loving and obedient, and that if ho had been a&#xD;
man with no fortunes to bestow, he would know his&#xD;
(laughter, whom he so idolized, to be very,~ very dif-&#xD;
ferent from what he so fondly imagined. Withmotit&#xD;
answering, I turned and left the study ~iY+~ilcnec,&#xD;
resolving that I would never marry and theni I, &amp;amp;o,&#xD;
would have fortunes to give away, and Nita should be&#xD;
the one benefited by thi~m. What did it matter if she&#xD;
and her husband were poor? Was not my wealth to&#xD;
the last farthing at their service? And so I wrote to&#xD;
the dear child; but of course did not pain her by tell-&#xD;
&#xD;
87&#xD;
&#xD;
ing of what Eleanor had done or what Sir Clarence&#xD;
had resolved to do, but only urged her to accept a little&#xD;
PreSent from ifle aIi(1 in the grateful note which came&#xD;
in answer, .1 saw that it was most acceptal)le and feared&#xD;
it W~iS needful also.&#xD;
She sent me about that time a snYLl oil painting of&#xD;
herself-the shoulders and head-with the long dark&#xD;
hair, falling gracefully over her neck, looped at one Side&#xD;
with a tiny pink rosebud, with its three green leaves.&#xD;
And those large, expressive eyes arc now looking (IOWIL&#xD;
t~pon me as it hangs over my. little mantel, the only&#xD;
ornament in the room ,and for which I would not take&#xD;
in exchange all the ornaments and valuables in this&#xD;
great WOPI(l. iNo, no ! I love it far better than all&#xD;
these things, nor ~ould they even tempt me to part&#xD;
,1~witli it-this little picture, with its ebony and gold&#xD;
frame, and its sweet eyes that look at mc the last thing&#xD;
every night and the first in the morning~&#xD;
So, as I said, the year passed on as other years had&#xD;
gone. Eleanor and Lord Gordon had met 'frequently.&#xD;
lie used to make our house his home, at Sir Clarence's&#xD;
urgent request, every time he came over to Ireland.&#xD;
Those were happy visits for Eleai~or. They used to&#xD;
ride, sail, walk, p)ay chess, and sing duetts together.&#xD;
She was very, very happy. Everything seemed to&#xD;
favor her, her father being scarce less captivated with&#xD;
Lord Gordon than herself; and it did not require a&#xD;
close observance to -see that these two young persons&#xD;
were mnutuaiiy in love, and that Sir Clarence approved&#xD;
of it. "Mv Lord Gordon" was considered first in&#xD;
everything in the ~~hole household. I was not with&#xD;

'John, (10 you think to-morrow wilEbe a fine day?&#xD;

"Now, Eleanor, I would' Eke to call you what you&#xD;
eallPd me the last time we conversed upon the subject,"&#xD;
I answered.&#xD;
Oh, but, John, in a marriage of this kind it is so&#xD;
necessary for everything to be PrOl)itiOUS. You know&#xD;
how unph~sant it WOUI(l be if it were otherwise. I am&#xD;

if it will gratif~r you, I will 5it tip until twelve to-night,&#xD;
r~n(l report then."&#xD;
"Oh, then," she said, "ii would be fast asleep, and&#xD;
it would matter veryjittle if it rose or fell."&#xD;
"Then I cart do nothing for you except to wake you&#xD;
up early in the morning and tell you whether the sun&#xD;
is shining Or~ not, an(l if it iS not, sen(l wo~'d to~ Lord&#xD;
Gordon to wait until the next fine day."&#xD;
Oh, hush making fuii of us," she returned ; " it is&#xD;
110 joking matter."&#xD;
"No," said I, "if I thought of it as you do, if&#xD;
to-morrow was a gloomy day, I would certainly send&#xD;
that word to Lor(I Gordon."&#xD;
"Come," sai(l Eleanor, suddenly changing the con-&#xD;
versation, "come and help me tell that stupid Jackson&#xD;
how to arrange the flowers and vases. You know 11&#xD;
can never do any thing unless ii have so~ne one near&#xD;
me to advance ~an idea."&#xD;
"Oh! Eleanor, I am so sorry that Von found me&#xD;
here. I was in hopes that my (lay '~ wor was over,&#xD;
for you certainly have kept m~ busy, and von know&#xD;
'all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.'"&#xD;
"You ought to lia~ played all the time, then, if it&#xD;
would have brightened you up any," she returned,&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;

sun of its brightness to-morrow, I am not surprised at&#xD;

hon an(1 was as l)laek as night ; near the outer e(l(re it&#xD;
seemed tinged with blood, and it had almost PCaChl(d&#xD;
the san that was nearly over the church. I felt a&#xD;
shudder creep over me, but still hoped that it would&#xD;
hot shadow the sun's brilliance, but just as the two&#xD;
were pronounced man and wife, it ~caine directly over&#xD;
~that great luminary and caused a gloom and darkness&#xD;
almost like an eclipse. I saw Eleanor start, shudder&#xD;
and grow deadly pale, but the company clustered so&#xD;
closely around her to congratulate her; thKat she h4d&#xD;
not time to think about it. Shortly after arriving at&#xD;
home she met mc in the hall in her traveling dress,&#xD;
with the frightened look still upon her pale face.&#xD;
" Oh! John," she sai(I, "did you see it?"&#xD;
"What, Eleanor?" I asked, looking perfectly uncon~&#xD;
&#xD;
I;,&#xD;
&#xD;
SCIOUS, and trying to make her believe that I had not&#xD;
noticed anything.&#xD;
"Oh, the cloud ! the cloud ~i' she cried. "I am per~&#xD;
feebly miserable. II am sure it was ominous, and, oh!&#xD;
wasn't it dark. I am ~o nervous that I can hardly&#xD;
walk."&#xD;
And it was so. The poor thing was almost fright-&#xD;

its tinge of blood, I am afraid she would have lost her&#xD;
Senses with terror. 11cr father called her to him to&#xD;
say a few parting words alone, and as I saw him put&#xD;
his arms around her affectionately, .s'o ~fl'cciiomate1y, I&#xD;
thought of the other child who, a short time ago, had&#xD;
been repulsed and so cruelly turned out of that very&#xD;
room, without one kind look or word to help her to&#xD;
say good-bye to the home she so dearly loved. El~a-&#xD;
nor came out smiling, with a happy face; Nita had&#xD;
come pale and trembling, with great, bitter tears fall-&#xD;
I ng from those dear eyes that would never look on the&#xD;
old familiar spot again. Eleanor went away in a&#xD;
sup~rl) carriage, drawn by four magnificent greys, with&#xD;
servants in rich livery, and all bidding her good-bye&#xD;
in a happy, cheerful manner, with everything propi-&#xD;
tious to her happiness. The other poor child walked&#xD;
by the pale moonlight on the arm of her husband, with&#xD;
me, their only companion, to see them off and to wish&#xD;
them well, even the servants being prohibited from.&#xD;
sayIng good-bye to their beloved mistress. She went&#xD;
away in the quiet night, not to scenes of gaiety and&#xD;
splendor, but to a quiet home in Scotland, where she&#xD;
would help her husband earn his daily bread with her&#xD;
own delicate hands.&#xD;

that I was necessary to Sir Clarence, who was fast&#xD;
growing old and infirm, and knew that if he ordered&#xD;
nie never to return to his house my pride would iiot&#xD;
allow me to do so, and I ~had written so to Nita. I&#xD;
received another letter from her which said that Sir&#xD;

had been employed at. lie had purchased several&#xD;

One evening, four ycar~ after her marriage, I was&#xD;
sitting on the old veranda; it was the anniversary of&#xD;
her marriage iiiglit. I bad thought more of her that&#xD;
cvenillg than F had for over a year. It seemed&#xD;
as it' even the drops of water froi~n the *jets in the foun-&#xD;
tains were whispering her name in the music they made,&#xD;
~is they gently fell into the basins ; and the flowers, as&#xD;
they bent their pretty heads of various colors towards&#xD;
each other , seefrued talking in low tones of her who had&#xD;
so tenderly reare(l them in years gone by. A strange&#xD;
feeling of anxious sadness came ~ver inc as I thought&#xD;
a gain of the words in her letter-" If anything should&#xD;
happen my husband I woiidd die." When I went to&#xD;
my room, I gazed long at her little picture. It almost&#xD;
seemed to take life and look at me, and smile in the&#xD;
old, old way. I wondered if she had changed, and fell&#xD;
asleep wondering if those dear eyes looked the same&#xD;
and if her sweet voice had lost any of its music. I&#xD;
cannot say how long I had slept when I started up&#xD;
wide awake from a horrid dream, which left me in a&#xD;
cold perspiration. I was not a believer in dreams, but&#xD;
tlii~ OflC seemed 1)roj)lletie. I thOU~l1t I had gone to&#xD;
see iNita in Scotland, but nowhere could I find her. I&#xD;
looked round the little cottage they told me was her's&#xD;
but she could not be found. I saw a large greeu mea-&#xD;
dew, full of tall waving gTass, in Whi('h I wandered.&#xD;
While there, I noticed an old man, with long white&#xD;
heard and hair, holding a. scythe in Iui~ hand with&#xD;
which he was rapidly inowu~g. I drew near to him&#xD;

and sa~v that iU his reaping lie was mowing down a&#xD;
beautiful white lily. I sprang forward to save it, and&#xD;
received the form of Nitti, COl(l atid lifdess, in iuiy&#xD;
arms. I could- only look at time old i'eapei', who&#xD;
answered my inquiring look by saying : " Soii, the&#xD;
Lowers must thu as well as the grass." I woke at this&#xD;
and a deadly terror s~iz~d 11W. 1 SjWaIIg from iiiy bed&#xD;
and looked at my watch on the 'maittel, and ibLmnd it&#xD;
Was two o'clock. iNot beino' able to shake oft' time feel-&#xD;
ing of dread that weighed upou me, I dressed and went&#xD;
out on the balcony to refresh myself with the night air.&#xD;
I lit a cigar and sat (iowa. The moon was consider-&#xD;
ably on the wane, and the stars looked to my troubled&#xD;
gaze as if they did no~ ~aut to give thisworld of ours&#xD;
any of their brightness. I sat and thought of the cold,&#xD;
dead form that had fallen into my arms in my sleep,&#xD;
and shuddering at the remembrance of that frightful&#xD;
dreamn-the repeater in my room had reached half-past&#xD;
three o'clock-when I heard in the still morning th~&#xD;
sounds of a horse galloping, rapidly over the country&#xD;
road; it neared the Lodge gate and then ceased. In&#xD;
a moment, a loud, strong haloo was borne upon the&#xD;
morning breeze. I saw by the light in the porter's&#xD;
window, which was instantly OpCflC(l, that lie was&#xD;
arousecI,~~ and his white head soon peeped through the&#xD;
door, followed by the necessary question, "Who comes&#xD;
there?"&#xD;
"The bearer of a despatch for Mr. John Meredith&#xD;
to be given quickly as poSsil)le."&#xD;
My heart gave a sudden bound and seemed as if&#xD;
bursting from my breast. Who but Nita would send&#xD;
&#xD;
U&#xD;
&#xD;
me a despateli? True, t had business mattOr3 of impor~&#xD;
tance in England, but would the trustees be mad&#xD;
enough to s'nd a despatch to 1110 in the night to&#xD;
frighten me, even if' I had met with SOflTh pieCe of&#xD;
o~reat ill-lack ? No ! it could not be. [ was thinking&#xD;

ri~ading the following:&#xD;
Dear Sir,-I am truly sorry to have to send such painful news,&#xD;
but such is life, ever full of sorrow. The 'beloved and highly&#xD;

It was only necessary to read this fearful news once&#xD;
to take in all its terror. Those few words, "the almost&#xD;
impossibility of bis beautiful young wife surviving this&#xD;
dreadful calamity," seemed stamped in indelible letters&#xD;
llj)0ll my heart. Tile olJ porter, who had been watch-&#xD;

Ihit time, no matter how slowly it seems to pass, flies at&#xD;

A young If iglllan(l lassie opened the (loor for rue, and&#xD;
when I 1)ronollneed my name, led me to a little parlor,&#xD;
with l)retty white curtains and neat furniture. The&#xD;
flowers in the vases, which had been carefully arranged&#xD;
by the hand that I knew so well, were withered and&#xD;
fiided for want of the tender care they were accustomed&#xD;
to. I (li(l not notice these things at the time, for I&#xD;
could think of but one thing then, and that was my&#xD;
l)O0~ Nita, suffering and bereaved, but before I left the&#xD;
I iouse I scanned carefully-oh, how carefully !-every-&#xD;
thing that had been cherished or tended by her. I was&#xD;
but a few minutes in the room when the door opened&#xD;
and a venerable gcntlemaii entered, who introduced&#xD;
hi 'uself as the person who had sent me the dispatch.&#xD;
"Sir," lie said, in answer to the hurried question&#xD;
asi~ed him about my cousin, "she is, we fear, very low.&#xD;
The doctor will be here in a few inonients to acquaint&#xD;
von with all the l)articulars."&#xD;
As the tears fell from my eyes, this good man seemed&#xD;
touched.&#xD;
"Dear sir," he continued, "this is indeed a severe&#xD;
trial that God has seemed pleased to afflict you with.&#xD;
We all loved your cousin here as if she were our own.&#xD;
her husband was my sister's only child, and we were&#xD;
as devoted to his beautiful wifb as we were to Ii m~n.&#xD;
here his VOiCC trembled so much that he ceased to&#xD;

"Michael," I said, when T at last recovered my&#xD;
voice, "have my horse saddled immediately, and my&#xD;
valise packed-only a change; I can't wait for more-&#xD;
and let me be g~me."&#xD;
"That is right, young master," he said, and turned&#xD;
to obe~*. a hurried lines to Sir ClarenQe, and left&#xD;
I wrote few&#xD;
the dispatch for him to read. I would not allow him&#xD;
to be called for fear it might delay me, and then, per-&#xD;
haps, I might never see my darling alive. I walked&#xD;
down to the lodge ; just as m~r horse came up I mounted&#xD;
him and rode off. I was not long in wearing out my&#xD;
1~oor steed from the. rapid pace at which I rode, and&#xD;
before I got to the relay where I could change the poor&#xD;
animal, lie w~s almost f~iintin g from exhaustion. Early&#xD;
tue next morning I was in the sailing vessel which was&#xD;
to take me over to Scotland. The motion of the boat&#xD;
was too slow for me, and it felt as if I could walk faster,&#xD;
so great was my anxiety to reach my destination. I&#xD;

Tb~k. Then I felt how selfish it was in me to think&#xD;
only of my grief when this noble man was so bravely&#xD;
battling against his emotion. I begged him to, forgive&#xD;
me for thinking too much of myself, and thanked him&#xD;
fir the example of resignation he had set me.&#xD;
lie laid his hand gently on my head as I finished,&#xD;
and said in a kind, tender voice:&#xD;
"Au, my son, you arc younger by many years than&#xD;
J am, and life's battles seem more difficult to fight in&#xD;
our youth than in mature years, when we think more&#xD;
of the world to come than of this."&#xD;
Here the doctor entered, and as I went up to him to&#xD;
ascertain 'his opinion, I saw from the grave expression&#xD;
of his face that he had but little hope for my cousin.&#xD;
"Sir," he said-in answer to my inquiry, is there no&#xD;
hope ?-" in cases of this kind it is better to give expli-&#xD;
cit answers to relations wishing to know the truth, and&#xD;
J am pained to tell you that there is none. Your&#xD;
young cousin has n~t many hours for this world."&#xD;
I shuddered with excessive grief as I walked after&#xD;
the physician, who led the way to Nita's room.&#xD;
She opened her eyes as I entered and gave a low cry&#xD;
of glad recognition. She raised herself, and in an&#xD;
instant was in my arms. Yes, there at last, after all&#xD;
those years,. with no husband between us now. Oh,&#xD;
merciful heaven, for her recovery-to keej) her always.&#xD;
But no, God ordained otherwise.&#xD;
"John, 5ohn,'~ she sobbed, "you have come only to&#xD;
see my tronbic and sorrow. how differently I expected&#xD;
to meet you ! And you did not expect to see me this&#xD;
way wheu you ~aw me again, did you, John?"&#xD;
&#xD;
~r.&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, T~ETR1BUTI0X.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Hush, Nita dear. Don't excite yourself. Try to&#xD;
get better, try to, for the sake of the many who ai'e&#xD;
waiting in breathless anxiety to see you well again."&#xD;
"That they will never see, John-never--never.&#xD;
My heart and my hopes. are in my husband's grave)&#xD;
and my body will soon lie by him."&#xD;
She turned her l)alC, careworn face from me to the&#xD;
wall as she said this, and the tears chased each other in&#xD;
rapid succession down those thin, white cheeks, which,&#xD;
four years ago, had put the very roses to the blush.&#xD;
The doctor whispered "to say no more she must be&#xD;
quiet." So when she turned to speak again, I l)eggc~i&#xD;
her to be quiet and rest.&#xD;
"It is no use, my dear John, to be so careful of me,&#xD;
for I feel that God will soon give my poor heart a long,&#xD;
long rest. Not many suns will rise for me."&#xD;
"Oh, Nita," I j)leaded, "for the Ewe of heaven do&#xD;
not speak that way. Oh, my dearest, you do not know&#xD;
the wound yoU are inflicting upon me."&#xD;
I must have looked my agony, and I think a ray of&#xD;
the real truth dawned upon her then for the first time.&#xD;
I was unable to control this feeling, my grief was so&#xD;
completely mastering me, and my love, which I would&#xD;
have hidden, shown through it and frightened me when&#xD;
I saw that she perceived it. i!Jer pale face grew paler.&#xD;
"Poor John," she said, "poor, poor cousin ! May&#xD;
God bless you ever and ever, nw only friend. What&#xD;
would I have done through all these many years if it&#xD;
had not been for you, my brave, noble friend ~?"&#xD;
"Do, dear NiLi, II beg, say no more."&#xD;

much importance, and one which lies very near my&#xD;
heart. It is of my loor little baby, so young to lose&#xD;
his mother."&#xD;
"Yes, Nita," I interrupted her with, "think of that&#xD;
and live."&#xD;
She answered with a weary smile, and continued&#xD;
"John, will1 you lake my I)OOV little orphan and be&#xD;
a father to him.. For God's pu~~ love, cherish the lit-&#xD;
tle creature. For I he sake of hi~ mother, who shared&#xD;
with you all her childish griefs and joys, oh, love my&#xD;
little 0flC~ my poor little one."&#xD;
her eyelids quixyred and the pale lips writhed with&#xD;
l)ain. Iii leaned over her and said&#xD;
"Nita, Ii l~erq pi'oimsc in the presence of God to he&#xD;
a fitther to y.ou&amp;amp;chihl, to stand by hint in adversity aid&#xD;
pi'osperity, to do all that is within me to keep off I ~'ie&#xD;
rude storms of life from his devoted head, to think 11 :st&#xD;
of his soul and body in everything, ai~d my first prayer&#xD;
in the morning and my last at night shall be to call&#xD;
down blessings upon him."&#xD;
Then," ~he said, turning and opening her eyes, in&#xD;
which a peculiar light was shining, " I (lie happy, and&#xD;
may God listen, to the prayer of a dying servant and&#xD;
bless you, my kindest and best friend, forever moit."&#xD;
She lay back with a quiet smile, and I hoped and&#xD;
praye~l in my inmost soul that she would i3eturn from&#xD;
the dark region of death she had almost reached and&#xD;
live. Towards eve she slept again, but when I lifted&#xD;
her dear, head to give the prescribed medicine, she&#xD;
murmured, "No more trouble." I never left her after&#xD;
that. liter night was restless a~ul an uneasy due. The&#xD;
&#xD;
Highland girl that first met me, and a Sister of Char-&#xD;
ity, with Sir James, sat up with me. She asked for&#xD;
nothing during that anxious time; though she would&#xD;
often during the night clasp her hands together and&#xD;
repeat her prayers over and over~again, and would smile&#xD;
when the Sister, who spent her night on her knees by&#xD;
the bedside, would recite some consoling aspiration.&#xD;
Once she turned, as I smoothed her pillow, and held&#xD;
out her hand, which I took and never relinquished&#xD;
until the angel df death snatched her away front me.&#xD;
She asked for her baby about an hour afterwards. It&#xD;
was brought to her immediately. I held it with one&#xD;
hand, whilst I held her's with the other. She ki~sed&#xD;
again and again, in passionate tenderness, the little&#xD;
bright face, and I never saw such a look of ine~pressi-&#xD;
ble relief and content as when she saw that the little&#xD;
creature took a fancy to me at once, and laid his little&#xD;
face to mine with thie~winning ways of his mother.&#xD;
"It will (10," she said. "You will love each other."&#xD;
hen the baby was taken away, I noticed such a&#xD;
change, that I called, to the little girl to tell the doctor&#xD;
to come instantly. I was almost beside Thyself with&#xD;
sorrow. I had hoped until this moment that she would&#xD;
live-~until the moment when the doctor entered the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
." If you have any questions to ask," he said, "now&#xD;

to than cfYect. After a last yi~it to that newly-formed&#xD;
mound, where a coffin made by maim's hali(15 coulol eou~&#xD;
tam so much that was lOVe(i and dear, I returned to niy&#xD;
home in Erin. II cannot forget how I met fL~ 01(1 ma~&#xD;
With bowed hea(l, whose hairs, age and 'trouble had left.&#xD;
in their wjnter of life so few and so white, were seemingly&#xD;
uncared for, and fell neglected U~0fl his sorrow~stricken&#xD;
brow. A sadder picture of woe II had never seen, and&#xD;
br the first time Ii felt there was one who was suffer-&#xD;
mo' more than me, caused by that greatest of all griefs,&#xD;
rcmoi'se. He dropped into my arms as I came up to&#xD;
him. Poor, poor Sir Clarence! My heart bled foi'&#xD;
the father, and then, for the first time, I forgave him&#xD;
for the pain he had 'given his younger child.&#xD;
"You saw her last! you saw her last'!" was all he&#xD;
could say, and trembled and sobbed as only an old man&#xD;
can, whose heart is torn by grief, and who knows that&#xD;
time is no more for him in which to rectify his great&#xD;
mistake.&#xD;
I tried to soothe him as best I could, giving him her&#xD;
Ia4 message over and over again as he required, inter-&#xD;
rupting inc every flow and then with heart-broken&#xD;
inquiries, an(1 calling upon hi lost one to come back&#xD;
once more to her old father.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Oh, my child ! my child ! " he wouh I say, "your&#xD;

her, who thought of her 01(1 home as a kind of Eden,&#xD;
and who, poor and needy as she was, WoulJ have&#xD;
gladly given half of her worldly Possessions for one&#xD;
more glimpse of the loved l)lace before she was taken&#xD;
to a better hand; "her greatest sorrow was your reso-&#xD;
lute silence," I continued, nnal)le to repress the feelincr&#xD;
of resentment I bad towards him.&#xD;
" Oh, (larling ! " lie groaned, in utter agony ; "my&#xD;
precious darling! to think that I robbed you of a sin-&#xD;

my life, and all time other lives that are (lear to me on&#xD;

and cheerless wh6u it was taken froai it. I never got&#xD;
used to its absence, an(l used to 51011 for it as if it ~~rc&#xD;
'0&#xD;
living. The little Thitil WaS tllC greatest consolation to&#xD;
mc, and he twined himself around my heart with a&#xD;
chain whose links could never be broken. lie pos-.&#xD;
sesseci all the sweet, artless ways of his mother, and&#xD;
kept me continually reminded of sonic clear trait '&#xD;
hers.&#xD;
He loved to be with me, and clung to me in sick-.&#xD;
iicss and in health. lie would appeal to me in his lit-&#xD;
tie troubles, and in pain, his little eyes, which were so&#xD;
much like those I had closed, and that were ~iOW SlCej)-.&#xD;
ing, would look at me to soothe him, as if I had the&#xD;
cure in my own hands. lie was the most jerfcc~&#xD;
image of baby loveliness an(l sweetness at night, when&#xD;
his little arms would be wound round my neck, whilst&#xD;
lie murmured, in half-brokcii accents, "God bless mc,&#xD;
and make mc a dood boy," that I ever saw. Then I&#xD;
would lift my ~vhole soul to heaVen, imploring the&#xD;
Divine blessing on this lonely infant head, and beseech-&#xD;
ing the "Father of the fatl~erless"to be tender and&#xD;
merciful to this pooi' little orphan.&#xD;
To Sir Clarence, *too, this little creature was the&#xD;
greatest comfort. Just learning to talk and walk,&#xD;
and with a thousand j)retty ways of doing everything&#xD;
~nd saying everything, each day ho l)ecame nearer and&#xD;
clearer, and every day 1)righter and smarter. When&#xD;
he had been with us al)out three years, there came a&#xD;
great change in poor Sir Clarence. lie had never&#xD;
recovered from the dreadful sliock the death of' the&#xD;
&#xD;
loved one gave him, and winch caused hirii tx go to an&#xD;
earlier grave than j)erhaps lie otherwise woul(l have&#xD;
done.&#xD;
One evening, whilst I was sitting by him in the lit-.&#xD;
t~e study, trying to divert him by reading from an&#xD;
iuterestilvr book I lIOticC(l his cyclitb droop, for I was&#xD;
very watchful of him u those ways. "Sir Clarence,&#xD;
are you feeling badly ?" I asked, a~ I cauo'ht his hall(l,&#xD;
which felt hot and feverish.&#xD;
Yes, my child, I am tired and weary, and wish I&#xD;
('Olild rest."&#xD;
Then," I said, " I will help you to your couch,&#xD;
where you can rest whilst I fan you, and l)el'llaP.s you&#xD;
may fall asleep."&#xD;
" Thank you, ur; son, maybe I would feel better;&#xD;
just help me therc,~ tell me what my poor, 1~sL&#xD;
baby told you when she was dying."&#xD;
I saw his mind7Was wandering' an(l bcckonc~1 to one&#xD;
of the servants I saw in the yard to come to me. I&#xD;
sent immediately for the physician, whLst I bathed his&#xD;
forehead and hands in a cooling, healing liquid.&#xD;
He was i'cstless and uneasy, and would tioze away&#xD;
now and then, only to start up to ask something about&#xD;
his children. "Was that Nita's voice I heard sing-.&#xD;
ing? has Eleanor come yet? Where are they?&#xD;
don't let them stay out late, John ; little Nita has a&#xD;
cough and these night dews may make it worse." I&#xD;
knew, front main' sentences he uttere(l in his delirium,&#xD;
that he had been thinking a great deal of the few&#xD;
events of our childhood, which I have mcntione~l, and&#xD;
of' Nita's going away. Again ho turned to me and&#xD;

&#xD;
said : "Did Sir Charles Stuart take my child from&#xD;
me ? and did she go ~f her own free' will? Yes, she&#xD;
went from out that door, and I told her she should&#xD;
never come back again. Eleanor showed great temper&#xD;
in killing the gUumea-~)ig, utll(l l)OO~ Lttle baby Nita&#xD;
bore it ~vith such amiability. She is sweeter tempered&#xD;
after all." ironi other remarks or his, I think he&#xD;
must have been thinking of all the acts oC their lives,&#xD;
trvino' t6 draw a comparison between ~them, which was&#xD;
0&#xD;
always favorable to Nita. Once he said, whilst I&#xD;
leaned over him bathing his forehead "John is a&#xD;
good boy, noble, generous and kind.-hcarted. I can't&#xD;
think he influenced Nita to go with that Scotchman.&#xD;
Oh ! if she had only married John I would, so gladly&#xD;
have given my consent, for lie is everything I could&#xD;
wish." II heard this last sentence with beating heart&#xD;
and throbbing brain. Then he had wished for that&#xD;
union which would have made me supremely happy-&#xD;
but God saw things differently from man, and II is holy&#xD;
will be clone.&#xD;
When the ~)1mysician arrived and had examined his&#xD;
patient, he told me plainly that Sir Clarence's nerves&#xD;
had been so shocked by the blow h~ had received front&#xD;
his child's death that they could, never recover, and&#xD;
that it would only take time to complete the work-&#xD;
and theii I knew I must see one more soul that I very&#xD;
tenderly loved take its flight, see one more gray&amp;amp; pre~&#xD;
pared for a dear one, before thc same tribute would be&#xD;
paid to me.&#xD;
"Sir," said the doctor, "Ii think you had better send&#xD;
immediately for his daughter, cor I can promise him&#xD;
but a few days more to live."&#xD;
&#xD;
112&#xD;
&#xD;
I (lid as lie directed, and then sat (lowil by the bed-&#xD;
,~ide of this good old man, who l]a(1 lived a noble, usc~&#xD;
fhl life, who had a multitude of friends, and enemies&#xD;
nowhere to bC found, and who was fast sinking an&#xD;
unresisting ~'~'y to the cruel reaper death, an(I destined&#xD;
so soon to leave us forever. Little Paul put his head&#xD;
of 1)rown curls into the room, and asked in a childish&#xD;
whisper, "Mayn't Ii ~'onie to see roy grandpapa? " I&#xD;
took him in my arms and held him up to look at his&#xD;
01(1 relative. The little creature must have noticed the&#xD;
great change in him, for he leane(l over and touched&#xD;
the aged cheeks with his young lips, ~fl(l said "Poor,&#xD;
dear grandpapa is sick !" My cousin opene(1 his eyes&#xD;
and recognized his little grandson.&#xD;
"My dear little baby! so you have come to ~ee youv&#xD;
grandfather before lie goes?" an(l he drew his curly&#xD;
head to him, and, kissed the fresh, rosy lips for the&#xD;
last time. He then 1)lessed him and I took him away.&#xD;
Eleanor came the next day, Sir Clarence, in the&#xD;
meantime, so weak that no one was allowed to enter&#xD;
th2 room but old Patrick, the doctor and myself. That&#xD;
nio~ht as I Was supporting his head, he said tome:&#xD;
"John, you have been of the greatest comfort to me,&#xD;
my son, and God will bless you. Of course, mv child,&#xD;
as his mother, I also leave von unlimited control of'&#xD;
little Paul; but JoIm, I would wish that the two little&#xD;
boys, Gerald and Paul, be brought up together, for I&#xD;
wish them to both know and i&amp;amp;ve each other, and form&#xD;
a warm, tender attachment. I will speak to Eleanor,&#xD;
when she comes, upon this matter, and I wish that my&#xD;
(lying request should be attended to."&#xD;

III woul(l have desired this otherwise fbr many rea~&#xD;
sons; first, that i[ did not want Paul to be brought up&#xD;
under Eleanor's roof; and, again, II would rather not&#xD;
bye with her mvselg ~hieh, ifl this (~aSC, 1 should be&#xD;
compelled to do. Then, again, there were advan-&#xD;
t'io'cs to be derived from this arran~inent which I&#xD;
couki not help but see. Paul would need a lady with&#xD;
him, as all boyS growing up do. if raised with only&#xD;
nIl old bachelor, like myself, lie would, J feared, lack&#xD;
the cultivation and refinement which only young men&#xD;
raised by lady-like mothers or with educated, refined&#xD;
ladies, can acquire, and l~leanor was the only female&#xD;
relative that either of us had that we knew anything&#xD;
about. After her arrival the whole matter was settled.&#xD;
We ~~'ere to live with her until the children were&#xD;
grown, then the old house in Ireland was to fall to lit-&#xD;
tIe Paul's share of Sir Clarence's fortune, which was&#xD;
equally divided bet~veen his grandsons.&#xD;
I think Eleanor was really grieved~ for the first time&#xD;
shice I knew her, when she sa~v her father's approach-&#xD;
ing death. I tried to arrange everything exactly as he&#xD;
wishe(1 Concerning the children, though I[ saw Paul's&#xD;
aunt was not please with the beauty, hc~dtlm and attrac-&#xD;
tive ways of the little orphan, when her owni well-&#xD;
attended boy was pale, sickly and irritable. They&#xD;
were kept~ far away from the sick roOm, and every-&#xD;
thing in the house sc~med as still and quiet as if it&#xD;
were no longer inhabited.&#xD;
Two days after Eleanor came we sa~v the death&#xD;
struggle approaching. I held both of his hands in&#xD;
mine, feeling the pulses grow weaker and weaker.&#xD;

&#xD;

Eleanor leaned, with her face hurie(l in her hands, near&#xD;
the 1)ed while the old servants stood around with their&#xD;
sorrowful eyes looking, for the last time, on their o4d&#xD;
master, who had been a kind, lenient and generous one&#xD;
to them. The doctor was there, too, but his skill was&#xD;
of avail no longer ; there was a stronger hand than his&#xD;
at work, and one that had never failed, combat it as&#xD;
you would. I called softly 'to Eleanor, as I saw thai&#xD;
was rapidly ebbing a~vay. She came and stood by&#xD;
him, 1)tlt it was my name he called, and I leaned over&#xD;
an(l heard these, last words, "May God and His an~'els&#xD;
J)lcss ~" lie could say no more' his eyes clo~cd,&#xD;
that noble heart ceased locating, and the world had lust&#xD;
another good old man. ~&#xD;
It was a sa(l house that we were to leave l)eJ'hiaPs&#xD;
forever, and go over to England. I walked arohild&#xD;
each loved sceneand seemed to love them more and&#xD;
nore, as I felt I must leave them for many, many&#xD;
years. Everything was as it used to be when Nita&#xD;
anti I played together among the fountains, which&#xD;
were still play~uig, though we rambled there no more.&#xD;
11cr Nile lilies in the conservatory I went to look&#xD;
at; even they seemed sad, with their heads drooping&#xD;
lovely to the ground. Near the beautiful waters of the&#xD;
Shannon, where I had once heard her sweet, plaintive&#xD;
voice in the evening hymn, I lingered, and thought of&#xD;
how many weary hours I had passed since then, how&#xD;
many a sigh of grief and sorrow had escaped my lips,&#xD;
how many fresh wounds were made~iu my heart which&#xD;
would never more be healed, and how many more&#xD;
would be there before that lQvCd spot would meet fl~&#xD;

and too well used to society to show any emotion or&#xD;
cxcitemeht at the expected arrival, but I noticed that&#xD;
on the particular evening when the duke made his&#xD;
appearance she took great pains in the arr:m~rement of&#xD;
her own t~i1et and that of her 4itth~, ton, who was, I&#xD;
thought, dressed fur too extravagai~tlv, eveti tbr a noble-&#xD;
man's child. Little Paul was drcsscd after my Ihnex~,&#xD;

simply and plainly. '\~hen the two little boys caine&#xD;

my ~ WdOS( ~ij~d \V~1S too BObIC to harbor either envy&#xD;

a nobler nature is enshriiYed here than is possessed by&#xD;
his iXir m~thcr, could but the right hand guide it and&#xD;
lead it ari~ht."&#xD;
While I thus sat musing, Eleanor came up to us and&#xD;
seated herself beside me on tile piazza.&#xD;
Don't von think our little lord looks very pretty,&#xD;
John?" she asked, lifting the child to 1xc~ knee ttfl(I&#xD;
imprinting a kis:4 On his delicate cheek. " Why did&#xD;

It is a good     ~, she Yai(l, laughing lightly,&#xD;
"that every crow thinks its own the blackest " and gave&#xD;
a finid look at the little J~oy on her lap.&#xD;
I suppose so," was my short answer, as Ii saw in&#xD;
he (listajice the carriage of the old duke approaching.&#xD;
Eleanor- made everything unusnaHy attractive and&#xD;
a(rreeaJ)le by Ixing so herself an(l looking very lovely&#xD;
in her evening costume. She greeted him with pecli-&#xD;
liar warmth and respect, and ii saw that he was both&#xD;
pleased and (llartflCd with the beauty of the woman&#xD;
before him. I lie was a fine, nol)le-lookin(r~ old man,&#xD;
with simj)le, sweet manners, and possessed the power,&#xD;
which few acquire, of winning one almost at first sight.&#xD;
lie was extremely interesting in conversation, and tile&#xD;
tones of his voice were soft and pleasant to the ear.&#xD;
lie seemed to make himself very m neji at home at the&#xD;
Lodge, and I found myself eacll moment growing more&#xD;
and moPe interested in him.&#xD;
The evening was passing ple~isantlv and rapidly&#xD;
avcay, the sun fast disappearing in the west, as&#xD;
we (lrcw on r t'h~~i's near the drawing-roon i window&#xD;

-   fond of' children."&#xD;
"iii will bring my son ~here," she said, rising, whilst&#xD;
[ a smile of pleasure lit up her handsome face. "I won-&#xD;
dcr that he has not been here long ago to see you. But&#xD;
he seems so inter~ste(l at present and so busily engaged&#xD;

II saw she was delighted that her child had been&#xD;

As I have saia before, lie was a pale, delicate child,&#xD;
not unlike his mother in flice or disposition, but less&#xD;
irritable and passionate.&#xD;
The duke took him kindly by the hand and said he&#xD;
d was" a real little girl of a boy," and asked why he did&#xD;
not bring his little brother to see him, pointing to Paul,&#xD;
who was still in the yard.&#xD;

Nita's ('hil(l an(l her OWn l~asse(l by unnoticed. II&#xD;
thought, too, that it was art unhappy event for Paui1,~'&#xD;

H (luke spent some time with us, and seemed&#xD;
l)le~lse(l with the freshness of the country scene, whilst&#xD;
Ihic. pure air of the healthy locality lent vigor and&#xD;
strength to his frame. EOr(l Gordon seemed very fond&#xD;
of this old frieu~l of his, and never tire(l of entertain-&#xD;

lloLiee(l, as I had when I fir4 came to the Lodge, the&#xD;

"Truly, iiiy lord, that is an unsightly-looking clump&#xD;
of trees. I think if I were a }nghwayman I wouI(l&#xD;
t&amp;amp;~ my stand there and feel no apprehension of being&#xD;

Lord Gordon said:,&#xD;
"Yes, people generally noticed the gloom of the&#xD;
place, which was deepened by a superstition attached to&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"What is it?" we both asked, eagerly.&#xD;
"Why, it is said, that when "my old grandaunt, who&#xD;
was 'crazy with eccentricity, planted theni there, she&#xD;
prophesied, 'that as long as they stood and flourished&#xD;

"That's strange," we both said, musing.&#xD;
"Oh, no!" he answered, laughing; "eccentric peov&#xD;
Pie losses a fund of imagination from which they gen7&#xD;
rally create dark and gloomy pictures."&#xD;
"That's true," was the quiet answer of' the Duke's,&#xD;
and we dropped this subject which had been renewed&#xD;
for the second time.&#xD;
The next day the old mafi left us. lie had given&#xD;
us much pleasure by his ~ and with many&#xD;
regrets we badcliim adieu. And now to return again&#xD;
to Eleanor and to the boys. The old Eleanor Graham&#xD;
was returning day by clay ; the cold, unkind manner,&#xD;
the haughty, imperious temper, the harsh and severe&#xD;
tones-and Ii felt more for little Paul in those days&#xD;
than I did even in years after, for she tyrannized over&#xD;
him when I was not by, and the little life that should&#xD;
have been all sunshine was inadc sad and unhappy.&#xD;
I noticed one night, when the children were in bed,&#xD;
and their brown and fair curls pilloweci on their&#xD;
do~vny cushions, that Eleanor came to tell her son goo~I&#xD;
night, which she always did, and pas~cd by the couch&#xD;
of Paul without noticing him. I had often, in nights&#xD;
before~ when I ~went~ to bid him good-night, noticed&#xD;
the tear drops on his glowing cheek, ajid I ventured&#xD;
to ask:&#xD;
"What is the matter, my boy?"&#xD;
"Why is it, uncle," he asked, "that aunt Eleanor&#xD;
never biils me good-night? I am sure I would be&#xD;
very happy if she would. You always kiss Gerald&#xD;
good-night, and why can't she kiss me?"&#xD;
" Nevcr mind~ my davhin~," I said ; "she does not&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, ItETPLIJ3UTJON,&#xD;
&#xD;
127&#xD;
&#xD;
intend to be unkind, it is only forgetfulness." So,&#xD;
when I saw the silken lashes resting upon each cheek,&#xD;
and heard the drowsy voice say ." good-i~ight," I stole&#xD;
softly to Eleanor's chamber. She was sitting near the&#xD;
open window, and I seated myself in the vacant chair&#xD;
beside her.&#xD;
"Eleanor," I l)egan, "why is it that you cannot be&#xD;
more affectionate in your manner to poor little Paul?&#xD;
Ii am sure you could at least give him a good-night&#xD;
kiss, and the little creature's heart would be so much&#xD;
lightened by it; he, child as he is, notices how very&#xD;
different your manner is to him than to Gerald."&#xD;
"And, indeed, sir," she said, with fire flashing in her&#xD;
eyes, "I want everybody to notice the difference. iDo&#xD;
you think," she continued, "that I, too, am going&#xD;
crazy over that chill, who is already as full of conceit&#xD;
as if he were a man of twenty-fix~e'? I think, for my&#xD;
part, that you are crazed on this subject. You are&#xD;
making yourself ridiculous about him. Yes, I do&#xD;
kant everybody to see that my child is preferred to&#xD;
him, ai~~1 everybody to know it."&#xD;
But, Eleanor," I said, "just for once put by preju..&#xD;
dice, and look with a j ~st eye upon the matter. Mould&#xD;
it either injure you or your child to be kind and just&#xD;
to a little orphan-one whose mother was your sister-&#xD;
and is it right in you to nourish the idea of this false&#xD;
pride and vanity in your son that he is superior to&#xD;
Paul and to other children? No, Eleanor Gordon;&#xD;
the day may yet come when you will wish that you&#xD;
had listened to advice, and treated with more care and&#xD;
tenderness 'the little boy whose mother is sleeping&#xD;
under the sod,?'&#xD;

that I could not P~Y him the necessary attention, On&#xD;
returning from one of these visits, I found the little boy&#xD;
looking weary and sad, with bright, feverish spots on&#xD;
his cheeks, and noticed that he clung closer and closer&#xD;

I believe in his heart felt it worse, and then she locked&#xD;
him up in the c0l(l~ damp cellar, and kept him there&#xD;

me that his young life hung upon a thread. IL felt a&#xD;
suffocating feeling rise in my throat. What could I&#xD;
do without this young child, that had his mother's face,&#xD;
his mother's eyes,. her thousand winiling ways, and all&#xD;
her nobleness of dispositioli. Ille was afl on earth I&#xD;
caretl for then-at least it seemed so to ~ne-all the rest&#xD;
appeared as a shadow to the sun ifl cOmj)ariSoll to this&#xD;
boy. Day and night I watched every moveflielit of&#xD;
his head, heard- each cry of pain, attended to every&#xD;
want, and found my devotion growing deeper anti&#xD;
deeper.&#xD;
Old Patrick, too, appeared- never to weary at the sick&#xD;
couch, seeming to rival inc in his attent~ouS. And,&#xD;
indeed, it was true that this little sick boy held the~-&#xD;
chord-s of his heart as well as mine. Th~ physician&#xD;
wa~ a kind, good man, who 5~eined most anxiouS about&#xD;
his patient, and never before had- I felt that any human&#xD;
being gave me the same amount of comfort in the same&#xD;
length of time. One day he said to me, whilst we&#xD;
were sitting by the bedsid~ of the sufferer:&#xD;
"Mr. Meredith, IL cannot tell how this little child of,&#xD;
yours has interested inc. lie is almost as dear to me&#xD;
as if he were mine, lie is truly the most manly little&#xD;
boy. IL ever saw, and is very prepossessing.~,~&#xD;
I gave him my hand, for my hearty was too full for&#xD;
inc to speak, and in that grasp we vowed eternal friend-&#xD;
ship; and together we saw the little fellow grow strong,&#xD;
until at last lie was convalescent.&#xD;

where hills were studded here and there, and l)etween&#xD;
them situated Aeasanfljn t narrow valleys, t U rou~u&#xD;
which murmured mans' a crystal brook over its peb11x~&#xD;

admiration on the many country seat- scattered around,&#xD;
which were undergoing summer repairs for their owners,&#xD;
who were stijl enjoying London life. While we were&#xD;
thus gazing and pointing from one lovely scene to&#xD;
another', Paul called my attention to a little white cot-&#xD;
tage nestled among some aged trees, whose huge branches&#xD;
seemed to chetcr it with their dense ibliage. It was a&#xD;
j)retty little cot, 8) SflOWv white, and with its ixw vines&#xD;

for th(~' little '\Vhite hOllS(  that Stood within it, but still it&#xD;
was all so ~ieat~y laid off in pretty ilowex.beds that you&#xD;
scarcely notiCed ibe great difference. There was a geIl-&#xD;
tie slope in the yard to the left, which ended in a small&#xD;
natural lake, whose waters were smooth and clear, and&#xD;
on whose border eyew many a pare WaiCr-lilX~. I t was&#xD;
altogether a ehaVflUflg little spot, and I Wt~$ nOt~ stir-&#xD;

"Oh, what a pretty phee ! I ~o~ld like to live&#xD;

No," I s:~id, " but we can go to that tree y ond" r&#xD;
and o'et a nearer yieW of it."&#xD;
So we walked a few yards further 'down to a neigh-&#xD;
boring beech and stood beneath its shade whilst we con-&#xD;
tinned to look upon the little cottage. In one of its&#xD;
windows hung a cage with a little canary, which was&#xD;
warbling away it's sweetest music and seeming to enjoy&#xD;
above all things the soft spring sunshine. A little girl&#xD;
came to the window and. threw in a handful of seed to&#xD;
the bird, wIle picked them up in his bill, apparently&#xD;
with the greatest relish. Then the little girl caine forth&#xD;
from a side door, holding a white kitten locked in her&#xD;
arms, and with two tiny white bare feet traveled with&#xD;
rapidity down to the lake. As she came towards the&#xD;
water, she approached much nearer to us, and I had a&#xD;
full view o~ the little figure~ which was clothed ifl a&#xD;
~Aue gingham dress, with a low~neckCd, short-sleeved&#xD;

The boys said no more, and I thought, as I had often&#xD;
thought before, had Gerald lbeeni away from his mother's&#xD;
influence and example, he would have been a different&#xD;
being.&#xD;
Very often after that we saw little Amy Waylandl,&#xD;
wvho sometimes came to the Lodlge with an old nurse to&#xD;
brn  Paul flowers that grew oa her favorite bushes.&#xD;
'The children played together, and seemed to enjoy&#xD;
amainlyhaving a itlegrl with them.. I used to&#xD;
sit on the piazza (for I always loved children) and&#xD;
watch the three in the vardl at play, wondering if -in&#xD;
after years these three little life paths would converge&#xD;
or diverge. Noticing all the while the three characte es&#xD;
that must one day be formed either for good or for en l,&#xD;
I could not help seeing how manly and gentle little Paul&#xD;
was to the young girl he ,christened Fary She&#xD;
would eling to him for protection, while she and Geral&#xD;
were always at openi warfare-I must say that Geral&#xD;
was always the .attacking party-whlile Paul would&#xD;
coax until he would get them ihto a good humor with-&#xD;
out using any violente on either side.&#xD;
Although there were but three nionths difference in&#xD;
these boys ages, still there were years in other respects,&#xD;
and Paul seemed to have the advantage.&#xD;
Eleanor even noticed the exceeding beauty of Amy,&#xD;
and tol me " she thought it would be dangerous for&#xD;
the boys if she continued to grow as pretty, for all boys&#xD;
go crazy over a pretty face, antd. either of .1em may&#xD;
forfeit his position mR order to marry her."&#xD;
I laughed, for what she said seemed ridiculous, and&#xD;
answered, "that if Paul. (chose to fall mn love with her&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
141&#xD;
&#xD;
when he was grow i lie could do so with my full per--&#xD;
mission andl conseit."&#xD;
" Andi you don't know even who she is ?" said&#xD;
Eleanor, with some warmth.&#xD;
"I know," I answered,"that she is a very sweet&#xD;
(childl, and I am sure her mother is a lady."&#xD;
" That is not sufficient for me," she exclaimed, turn-&#xD;
ing away, "and when she grows larger she must be&#xD;
kept awvay from my house altogether."&#xD;
I smiled to myself as she made this remark, as I&#xD;
thought it very silly ; for I did not know how it would&#xD;
all be in years to come.&#xD;
One evening I missed the three children from the&#xD;
yard, where they had been playing. I had been read-&#xD;
ng, and was so deeply interested in nmy book that when&#xD;
Ifinished I missed them for the first time, and could&#xD;
fidtem nowhere. It was very heedless in their&#xD;
attendants not to have been with them, but Eleanor&#xD;
and Lord .Gordon were in London, and in their absence&#xD;
the servants at the Lndge seemed to desire a holiday,&#xD;
and I could hardly blame them, for they had a right&#xD;
hard time of it other days. I went to look for the two&#xD;
boys who usually attended Paul and Gerald, but one&#xD;
of them, I was told, was bird hunting, and the other&#xD;
had gone some distance in the country to see his grand-&#xD;
mother. I was very muchi provoked when I heard&#xD;
this piece of news, and continued myself the search for&#xD;
the missing ones. I walked thi-ough the great avenue&#xD;
of trees, through the park, where deer were feeding&#xD;
leisurely here and there, but I could not fiud them. 1&#xD;
wa very uneasy when I went to the summer houses in&#xD;

lie took the child from me into his stout arms as if she&#xD;

said, in his grod~humored way, " not to be crazy, and&#xD;

of Dr. Arnold. II had sent home for the pOliyClUUsO&#xD;
to take the little girl home, and ~vhen' it arrived she&#xD;
was ready to go with me. She sat in my lap as I drove&#xD;
the pony along through the beautiful country, telling&#xD;
mc all the cireumStalices of the adventure., They had&#xD;
all gone to the stna'll~ island to get ~omC Ilowers that&#xD;
grew u p0i~ it, and "I being too near the edge, fell in,&#xD;
and. if it hadn't been for Paul, ~vould have been&#xD;
drowned."&#xD;
"Pidn't you know it was very naughty to have gone&#xD;
there at ala, you three little ones, by yourselves?" If&#xD;
asked.           "it must have been very naughty,&#xD;
Ye~," she said,&#xD;
but we never 'thought of that, and please don't tell my&#xD;
papa;" and there was a frightened look upon her. face&#xD;
v~ hich I never saw there before. "I am sure my niamifla&#xD;
will be so glad to know that I am saved, but papa will&#xD;
be very angry if he hears that I had gone there."&#xD;
II promised that I, would not, and we soon reached&#xD;
the cottage, nestling among th&amp;amp; trees, looking so cool&#xD;
and pleasant. The door was opened to us by the old&#xD;
woman who used. to bring Amy to the Lodge.&#xD;
"Is my papa at home, Kellie?" enquired the child.&#xD;
"No, d~ary," she replied, and she took the child in&#xD;
her arms, a~ if she understood why. th&amp;amp; question was&#xD;
i~sked.&#xD;
II asked to see Mrs. Waylaid, for I thought it was&#xD;
only right that she should be made acquainted with the&#xD;
adventure. I was taken into a little parlor, and was&#xD;
at once struck with the refined look of everything.&#xD;
'Tis true the furniture was old~fashiOnCd, but it was&#xD;
&#xD;
highly polished, and there was an air of taste in the&#xD;
arrarigemei~t of it. On the tables and brackets there&#xD;
were vases of flowers, filled with tt~e freshest and fairest&#xD;
()t Spring's flOral   ,         ~e whole room  with&#xD;
fragrance.&#xD;
I Was Scate(1 OJ)posite tI)e mantel, flfl(l over it I noticed&#xD;
Oe portrait of a young girl who was very fair and&#xD;
lovely, and there was sOii~etliing about the caln'f, sweet&#xD;
eXpression that reminded me of a face I had seen in&#xD;
years goii e by arid wliieh wits still irnl)ressed upon my&#xD;
lienil, Ihougli I lla(l only seen it with boyish eyes anti&#xD;
loved it with bovisiiiwart: it was the face of my own;&#xD;
lair mother. I had pushed open one of the shutters to&#xD;
gaze at it more fully, when the door opened and a lady&#xD;
entered. Amy said "Mamma," and I rose and intro-&#xD;
(bleed myself. I felt very much interested in her as&#xD;
she approached an(l held oLit her hand with such a Ioo&amp;amp;&#xD;
of gratitude in her face0 I at once recognized the Iike~&#xD;
11055 to the picture, but a change was there which was&#xD;
surely not caused by years, for she was still a young&#xD;
woman. The face now wore a very sad expression,&#xD;
which moved me, and I would have given a great deal&#xD;
.to have known something ot her past history. Trelateci&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;

JOhN DISCOVEnS SOME IWLATJONS.&#xD;
~Th ~ TIE small town of L- lay some ten&#xD;
to the ~vest of Gordon Lodge. It&#xD;
miles&#xD;
was well built, J)leasantly situated, and&#xD;
heahhfully located, with many hand-&#xD;
somely-built dwellings and wealthy factories. I had&#xD;
for convenience concentrated all of my business here,&#xD;
and one evening, weary and tired, as I was returning&#xD;
from this town, after a day of many business transac~&#xD;
t ions that were both tedious and disagreeable, Ii was&#xD;
riding along the edge of the moorland on horseback,&#xD;
for I was still fond of this mode of traveling. As I&#xD;
approached the grove of dark firs Ii saw a man leaning&#xD;
against one of them in a hunting-jacket, with his arm&#xD;
resting carelessly on his gun.- He was a slight, hand-&#xD;
some man, and his attitude was fearless and manly. I&#xD;
could not tell what it was that made me shudder, but&#xD;
think it must have been the man's position. He seemed&#xD;
to be of a most companionable disposition, for as I&#xD;
advanced towards him he mounted his horse and joined&#xD;
inc with a bow graceful enough for a cavalier in the&#xD;
time of chivalry. We were soon chatting very pleas~&#xD;
antly together, and I would have thought him on the&#xD;
a very estimable companion but fqr a restless,&#xD;
unquiet look in the eye which I did not like to encoun-&#xD;
ter. In the course of, our conversation he told me his&#xD;
~1&#xD;
aine, which was Godfrey Laughton, and the owner of a&#xD;
vei' beautiful country seat about three Ines from the&#xD;

L9dge, known as "Merry hall," for this young man&#xD;
was mU9h given to pleasure and sport, and thus appro-&#xD;
priately named his place. us Ori~i'I1 WaS cOmplCtClY&#xD;
unknown, though when he first caine into 4thc country&#xD;
he was supposed to be a Pole from his foreign appear-&#xD;
alWe, but soon became anglicized in eustofli and man~&#xD;
ncr, though few ~arcd to know where he came from.&#xD;
lie was wealthy and dashing, driving the finest horses,&#xD;
giving the most fashionable dinners, and furnishing the&#xD;
best of wines most lavishly, which made him very&#xD;
popular amongst thc young men, while mammas with&#xD;
marriageable daughters looked at the handsome hail&#xD;
and then, at the handsome man, and between the two&#xD;
he was, completely lionized.&#xD;
Our conversatioJ~ naturally turned on the people of&#xD;
the country as we passed some of their country seats,&#xD;
and lie told me there were a great many families com~&#xD;
ing down that seasoll who were in the habit of going to&#xD;
German watering places.&#xD;
Just here we came upon little Amy WayThnd and&#xD;
her old nurse, who were taking an evening promenade.&#xD;
I stooped down and shook the small hands that were&#xD;
held up to me, whilst Godfrey Laughton ran his hands&#xD;
through her silken curls, saying:&#xD;
"how is my little girl this evening 9&#xD;
"I'm well ," was the short and, It thought', cufrt&#xD;
answer, as she turned away from him ~ncl spoke to me,&#xD;
and during the rest of our con ~erS~tiOn she merely&#xD;
au~swered him in mo"nosyllables, without looking at him.&#xD;
III could not help noticing tl4s, thinking it was rather&#xD;
strange, and wondering ~~hat was the dislike the child&#xD;

&#xD;
could have for him. After we had left and ridden&#xD;
some distance he turned to me and said:&#xD;
"You have seen that child before, I see."&#xD;
"Oh, yes," I said, "I hav6 s6en her several times."&#xD;
"She is a very beautiful thing," was his rejoinder,&#xD;
"and has a very sweet mother."&#xD;
"Yes, I have seen her, too," was my reply.&#xD;
"Have you, indeed,'~ he sai(l, significantly, "then I&#xD;
suppose you have seen her husband also?"&#xD;
"No; I have never met him. I suppose you have&#xD;
had that honor, though."&#xD;
"Oh, yes; we have been friends ever since we met&#xD;
in her Majesty's service some three years ago. He&#xD;
was captain of a company in a foot brigade, and I&#xD;
belonged to the same regiment."&#xD;
"Then you are an Englishman," I said; "but you&#xD;
Seem to me to look rather yotipg to have 1)elonged to&#xD;
a 1!egiment some three years ago."&#xD;
I thought there was a slight hesitation in his voice&#xD;
a~ lie answered&#xD;
"Yes, bout I was always older than my looks, and f&#xD;
joined the regiment anyhow."&#xD;
I was but half satisfied when I heard him say this,&#xD;
and rode on for a few moments without speaking~&#xD;
Thou to break this silelice, which was embarrassing, I&#xD;
remarked:&#xD;
"So you know the Waylands?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes."&#xD;
"Are they from this part of the country?" I asked.&#xD;
"No, no," he said; "the captain met Mrs. Wayland&#xD;
in Ireland. She ~vas spending some time at her&#xD;

known care, for my acquaintances were few. As I&#xD;
neared the cottage I saw little Amy run from the&#xD;
house, slamming the door behind her. I naturally&#xD;
hurried on to bid her good morning, and as I opened&#xD;
the little wicket o'ate was somewhat surprised to see&#xD;
the chjld crouching beneath one of the rose 1)uslles, cvi~&#xD;
dently anxious to hide herself. I walked forward, afl(l&#xD;
what was my surprise to see tear drop 3 oii her rosy&#xD;
cheeks. I pj~k~d her up in my arms and asked her&#xD;
what was the matter. She only answered me with a&#xD;
low 501), as she nestled her head upon my shoulder. I&#xD;
carried her to the house, still in my arms, and noticed&#xD;
that she trembled at every step. I. reached the porch&#xD;
and was just about to lay my hand. upon the (loor, when&#xD;
it was opened from the inside, and I met, face to face P~r&#xD;
the fmr~t time, Captain Wayland. A more repulsix e-&#xD;
looking m~mn could scarcely be imagined; his f~mce was&#xD;
bloated with dissipation and wore a scowl that was&#xD;
truly forbidding. The child clutched me tighter the&#xD;
instant he made his appearance.&#xD;
"So, my little Miss," he broke the silence, without&#xD;
noticing me, you ran away from me, did you? but&#xD;
you shall be paid for all this."&#xD;
lIe attempted to snatch her from my arms, but I&#xD;
waved him back.&#xD;
'~ Who are you?" he said, with an angry frown.&#xD;
"Who dares interfere h&amp;amp;tween me and my child?"&#xD;
"When you are cool, Captain Wayland," I answered,&#xD;
"I will cease to interfere; but whilst you arc in this&#xD;
passion&#xD;
He tr~jl shall not ~touch this ~)Oor little one."&#xD;
again                 mc, 1)ut sh~ clung&#xD;

II&#xD;
&#xD;
to me, entreating that i[ would not let her papa take&#xD;
her.&#xD;
'As the child pronounced my name in her entrcatics,&#xD;
a complete mctam\orphosis took place in the man's face.&#xD;
I would scarcely have recognized. it as the same seowb&#xD;
ing, repulsive face that met me at the door. lie turned&#xD;
to mc with a smile ~and a bow, and with the most gen~&#xD;
I lenianly allil hospitable manner invited inc Io enter.&#xD;
Why this change should have taken place I never&#xD;
understood, unless he knew me to be connected with&#xD;
the powerful house of Gordon, or had heard of my&#xD;
wealth, for I believe I was reputed to be ~very rich&#xD;
man. I returned his courtesy by entering and enquiring&#xD;
for Mrs. Wayland.&#xD;
As I noticed hjs island, captivating manners, which&#xD;
I knew to be assumed, I was not surprised that the&#xD;
poor wife was,, ~o easily duped. She at last entered,&#xD;
and as I addressed my entire' conversation to her&#xD;
Captain Wayland shortly after arose, made his excuses&#xD;
and withdrew. There was a tired look on her face,&#xD;
arid 1 saw, too, thai her eyes were as much swollen&#xD;
as her child's. She was sitting on the end of a small&#xD;
sofa, with her elbow resting on its arm, and her hand&#xD;
supporting her fair head. ~Tbere was sometlmino' that&#xD;
attracted me very much to this l~frs. Wayland, some-&#xD;
thing that 1 could not detmne; perhaps it was because&#xD;
she was so young and seemed to have suffered so&#xD;
much. 11cr fi~ee) though so fair, was furrowed ~v&#xD;

there, t~o my eye was very sad, for I am sure the lady~&#xD;
could ~ot have exceeded more than ~&#xD;
but, like many h young life, it was wrecked in its&#xD;
spriflgtillle. Our conversation was quiet and pleasaill,&#xD;
for with me she seemed to be very much at ease, and~&#xD;
she ha(I an easy, modeSt ~vay about her which invited&#xD;
one's confidence, and which to me was very pleasing.&#xD;
On a table near me, on which my arlil was resting, I&#xD;
~Otic~ (l a worn VOhUll(' of" rrlloluas A 'Kerupis," which&#xD;
seemed to have been m~ich used. It w~ opened with&#xD;
its face downwards. I raised it as it lay, and saw that&#xD;
it was opell at the chaptc~r, "Son, I am the tord who&#xD;
g1v~s strength in the day of tribulatiolL" I ran my&#xD;
fingers through the book, and found, on the fly le~ F,&#xD;
in a woman's delicate handwriting&#xD;
"To my little daughter, Geraldine, on her 6th birthday.&#xD;
7 Sept. ~th, Oak Grove, on the James,&#xD;
Virginia.''&#xD;
"That is my little book, and it is the source of great&#xD;
consolatiOn to me," she said, ~is she watehec~ me looking&#xD;
through it.&#xD;
"Yes," I answered, "awl it is a very precioUS little&#xD;
volume; but is this your name written here?"&#xD;
"Yes." she replied.&#xD;
"And is this your birth-place, on the iianks of the&#xD;
James ?"&#xD;
She nodded in the idfirmative.&#xD;
" Then you are a Yirginiafl, I said, a~tonished,&#xD;
"and living away over here from your beautiful land?"&#xD;
"Yes," she said, "it is indeed a lovely country ; but&#xD;

the Lee instead of the James. My father was a cam&#xD;
taiii in the United States Navy, and died in the ser-&#xD;
vice of that country whilst I was still very young."&#xD;
I could scarcely eontr6l my impatience to know her&#xD;
another's~ name until she had finished sl)eakino' and&#xD;
then I quickly asked&#xD;
"Mrs. Waylaid, what was your mother's name?"&#xD;
"Mary ~ she replied, somewhat surprised&#xD;
at the abrupt manner in which I put the question.&#xD;
"Had she a sister?" I asked.&#xD;
"Yes, only one, who was some years younger than&#xD;
herself. There were only the tx~'o children, who were&#xD;
unfortunate enough to have lost their mother whilst&#xD;
both were very youi~g."&#xD;
"What was l~er name?" I said ,ahnost breathless,&#xD;
fo so much depended upon her answer.&#xD;
:K\no.cl~. and I have so often heard my~ mother&#xD;
sp ~ak of her beautiful young sister."&#xD;
Here I interrupted her, saying',&#xD;
"Mrs. Wayland, do you know that you are my cou~&#xD;
sin?" and took her hand.&#xD;
"What?" she said, with a new light in her eyes,&#xD;
anti her face becoming perfectly beautiful ; " what!&#xD;
you my cousin? my aunt Angela's child whom my&#xD;
mother so fondly loved, aiul who I was taught always&#xD;
to lox~e and P"~Y for?' You her child? then God has&#xD;
indeed blessed me, for I a in sure you will pity me and&#xD;
not forsake me as my other relations have dOLIC."&#xD;
Here the old, sad look returned, and I felt that I&#xD;
could almost weep for her.&#xD;

past history ; how she had suftered and how she had&#xD;
forfeited the love ci that noble ~nclC who had take"&#xD;
her t~ his heart, and who had bCen a land father to&#xD;

Gerald should not go, so he was rarely one of the&#xD;

inventing everything he could 'for her amusement;&#xD;

I could scarcely keep from sighing as I looked at them.&#xD;
for we were j ust as happy Once, our voices jUst as merry.&#xD;

"Indeed, I do," I said, as we saw her fly through&#xD;

they arc," pointing to Paul.&#xD;
"Yes they are," was her ~'eply, " and- III often wish&#xD;
that in times to come it *mav~ be as it is now, but," she&#xD;
said, and the sad light cai~ie again juto her eyes, " I&#xD;

"Bat, my dear Geraldine," I began, when I was inter-&#xD;
rupted by the opening of the little wicket gate, and I&#xD;
saw the man I had met un(ler the firs, Godfrey Laugh-&#xD;
ton. lie advanced smiling and bo~ving in his usual&#xD;
manner; in his path was little Amy, whom he picked&#xD;
up and kissed on her rosy cheeks. The a6t was nothiiv~0&#xD;
morc than I would have (lone myself bat still I was&#xD;
not altogether pleased when I saw it. He came upon&#xD;
the porch and sat down with us, and made his conver-&#xD;
sation pleasant and affable, but kept his head' slightly&#xD;
turned from us, an action which seemed natural with&#xD;
him, but which prevented us from catching his eye&#xD;
whilst he was talking.&#xD;
Geraldine, when he addressed her, mn~rely ans~vered&#xD;
in monosyllables, and I noticed that she slightly slmud-&#xD;
dered as lie stepped upon the piazza. After a while he&#xD;
asked for Captain Wayland.&#xD;
"I do not know where he is," said Geraldine, a little&#xD;
nervously; but scarcely had she uttered the words when&#xD;
he joined us. If e offered me his hand which I took,&#xD;
and then made room for him to pass; he nodded care-&#xD;

lessly to Laughton, and then seated himself on a bench&#xD;
and commanded the old ~voman Nellie, whom he espied&#xD;
through the windows, to bring him a drink, for he was&#xD;
as thirsty as a deer. lIe then made some few remarks&#xD;
al)OLlt tile weather. A few moments after, the two men&#xD;
rose) as if by mutual consent, and Lit us. Godfrey&#xD;

arm, "thai that man," pointing her finger to. Laugh-.&#xD;
toi~,"has never done me a l:nown injury, but from my&#xD;
very heart I abhor him?"&#xD;
This was the strongest expression I ever knew, before&#xD;
or after, Geraldine Wayhand to make; and this man's&#xD;
visit seemed to have left such a gloomy impress~o;m upon&#xD;

to see her. I went immediately, fearing that there&#xD;

cottage all appeared as usual, and I found my haste to&#xD;
have been unnecessary. After I had been there some&#xD;

"John, how long have we known ~each other?"&#xD;
"Let me see," I said musingly. "I lehieve about&#xD;

"Then my little Amy is entering her t~velfth year.&#xD;
Here read this5" ai~~ she placed in my hand a delicate&#xD;
scented envelope.&#xD;
I took out the folded paper and read&#xD;
"DEAR GERALDINE:&#xD;
Do not again refuse me the request I made last year and a year&#xD;
or two previous, to let me have my little namesake, Amy. I again&#xD;
renew the promise I have before made, and am more anxious now&#xD;
than ever to have the little darling. I cannot forget our girlhood,&#xD;
dear Geraldine, nor your unvarying kindness to me, and knowing&#xD;
how n~happi1y you are situated, I am more desirous than ever&#xD;
beioro to prove my gratitude to you by educating little Amy.&#xD;
Beside, it ~~'L1 be the greatest of pleasures to have her with me.&#xD;
Now, begging you once more not to refuse me,&#xD;
"I am, as ever, your devoted cousin,&#xD;
"AMY ST. CLAm."&#xD;
"Who is she?" I asked, folding up the letter and&#xD;
replacing it in its envelope~&#xD;
"She was Amy Oswald, my first cousin,' and the only&#xD;
oi~e of my family who wrote to me, or I suppose&#xD;
thought o me, after my marriage."&#xD;
"Does she live in Paris?" Ii asked, as I saw' the&#xD;
postmark of the letter.&#xD;
"Oh, no!" she said, "but her husband is very&#xD;
wealthy, and during a portion of the year she reside&#xD;
there. 'What do you think I had best do?"&#xD;
"I would advise you to send her by all means," I&#xD;
replied, thinking of her brutal father and the miserable&#xD;
opportunity she had of an education.&#xD;
"'Twill be a sad blow to me," she said, "to give&#xD;
her up, for she is my only comfort; but when I think&#xD;
of what a great advantage it will be to her, and know?&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

&#xD;
'too, that Amy St. Clair will be a second mother to her,&#xD;
I feel that duty requires me to let her go. None will&#xD;
know bow I will miss my darling child," she went on,&#xD;
but I have had so many heartaches already, that&#xD;
iiothino' 'eeinsvery hard to bear 110W ; l)Ilt should any-&#xD;
thing happen my poor child while ~;Im is away from&#xD;
mc, how could I ever get to her ~"&#xD;
"Never mind that, Geraldine, I answered; "I prom-&#xD;
ised to be your friend years ago, an(l I will always keep&#xD;
my pledge."&#xD;
She understood the significance of these words and&#xD;
heki out her hand, whilst gratef~~l tears gathered in her&#xD;
eyes. I clasped the extended hand warmly, and told~&#xD;
her that I would come again the next (lay and assist&#xD;
her in making all the necessary preparations.&#xD;
As I took my way homeward I could not help feel-&#xD;
ing very sorry for poor Geraldine, who could not enjoy&#xD;
in peace the one comfort that God had given her.&#xD;
When I reached the Lodge, I found Paul sitting under&#xD;
one of the trees in the yard studying his philosophy. I&#xD;
went up and took a se~ut by him, and asked him if he&#xD;
had missed his lesson.&#xD;
"Oh ! no, sir," he answered, quickly. "I was only&#xD;
studying this lesson for to-morrow, so that I would&#xD;
have time this evening' to o'o wi di you to the cottao'e"&#xD;
"Yes; Paul, I want you to go with me as often as&#xD;
possible in the next ten (lays, and see as much of Amy&#xD;
as you can."&#xD;

I did not know that this announcement would have&#xD;

his Pace changed color, and diiriiig the rest of the day lie&#xD;
was silent and gloomy. I walked with him again that&#xD;
evening to the cottage, and W~15 very much snri)rise(1&#xD;
upon reaching it to ~ee a carriage and pair drawn up&#xD;
before the door. We seated ourselves ii pon the piazza,&#xD;
not wishing to disturb the visitor. I knew it must be&#xD;
a lady from the soft musical tones that reached my ears&#xD;
every now and then, and, at one time, I overheard her&#xD;
say:&#xD;
Now, little Amy, whew4oti want a friend you&#xD;
know whom to apply to."&#xD;
And agamn:&#xD;
"Don't be fretting yourself' about youi4 mamma, for&#xD;
am here to take care of hers and whenever she wants&#xD;
you, you shall come back to her."&#xD;
Shortly after this I heard the rustling of a silk dress,&#xD;
and the lady came to the door followed by Geraldine&#xD;
and Amy. As she stepped on the piazza, Geraldine&#xD;
introduced me to Lady Grantly. She bowed very&#xD;
graciously, made two or three pleasant remarks, kissed&#xD;
Amy most affectionately, and I then assisted her to her&#xD;
carriage, in. which she was soon driven out of sight,&#xD;
1(aving a very agreeable impression upon me. She&#xD;
;as not pretty, but then there was something so s upe~&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
nor about her that I felt unconsciously attracted&#xD;
towards her.&#xD;
Geraldine told me afterwards that sIte was a good&#xD;
friend of hers, and that would have been enough of&#xD;
itself to inoTatiate her in my favor. After this we&#xD;
had a very j)h~1Sant chat, and Geraldine insisted that&#xD;
we should stay to tea; every evening of the next week&#xD;
we spent at the cottage. At last the day arrived for&#xD;
Amy's deparbire. Ii could scarcely repress a tear&#xD;
myself when I saw her trunk packed and labelled&#xD;
Paris, feeling how many changes would take place,&#xD;
during the years to pass, before I could see her pretty&#xD;
face again. I feared to think of' them, for I knew&#xD;
they would be many and great. Poor Geraldine, I&#xD;
never was as sorry for her as I was that morning. It&#xD;
seemed as if she could not give up her only' child; the&#xD;
expression of agony in her pale flice was so great that&#xD;
it was l)ainflll to look upon, and I turned away. At&#xD;
last she was compelled to bid her mother the final&#xD;
adieu as time was pressing, and I took her from the&#xD;
arms of her mother, sobbing as if her little heart would&#xD;
break, and we left Geraldine alone in the cottage with&#xD;
an almost broken he~rt.t Amy had kissed Paul too,&#xD;
who did not attempt to restrain his tears, for his heart&#xD;
was really touched, and he was very, very lonely after&#xD;
the little girl left.&#xD;
Her father was the last person she came to' in bid..&#xD;
ding us all farewell, and she turned to hint saying:&#xD;
"Good-bye, papa."&#xD;
"Good-bye, little Amy," he said, and leaned over&#xD;

a soft look in his eyes, which seemed to melt his hard&#xD;

door, waving our hands and handkerchiefs to her till&#xD;

CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
PAUL AND GERALD'S RETURN.&#xD;
&#xD;
MAY as well pass over a period of seven&#xD;
years here, for very little occurred in all that&#xD;
time that is worth writing about for the enter-&#xD;
tainment cf any of my readers. It is true&#xD;
that in that time we had sent our boys to college, and&#xD;
I need ~not say that we missed them sadly. With&#xD;
this exception everything went on in its usual routine,&#xD;
my dailyxisits to Geraldine, my weekly visits to Paul,&#xD;
and little contentions now and then with Eleanor was&#xD;
thQ way my life was spent; but now there was coming&#xD;
a great change, the boys were coming back, boys no&#xD;
longer, but young men. Paul was a graduate with&#xD;
the highest honors. Gerald was not so fortunate.&#xD;
Eleanor attributed this to ill-health, but I attributed&#xD;
it~ to its real cause, inferiority of mind. I could see&#xD;
each day that Eleanor was jealous of Paul's progress,&#xD;
and when she heard with what honor and distinction&#xD;
he had graduated, she turned away wholly displeased.&#xD;
It was already Thursday evening in June, and the fol-&#xD;
lowing day the boys were to be at home. I was so&#xD;
anxious to see Paul, that all the evening I was restless&#xD;
and walking about at random. Eleanor caine out and&#xD;
met me as I came upon the piazza, and joined me in&#xD;
my promenade.&#xD;
"I declare, John," she said, "I can scarcely wait&#xD;
until to-morrow to see Gerald, I am so anxious te see&#xD;
him. Lord Gordon," she said, addressing her hus~&#xD;

band, who was smoking a cigar at the upper cnd of&#xD;
the balcony, and watching his (logs gamboling on the&#xD;
lawn, "has Gerald improved any, you have seen hunm&#xD;
since I have ?"&#xD;
"It won't bie long until you. can see for yourself,&#xD;
Eleanor, and I would rather you wouldl be- the judge.&#xD;
Paul is a handsome fellow, John, and he has such a&#xD;
fine address."&#xD;
"Yes, Paul has given me great satisfaction, and I&#xD;
am justly proud of hima, a worthy descendant of the&#xD;
House of Graham," I said, looking at Eleanor, think-&#xD;
ing that this would please her, for she was proud c f&#xD;
her family ; but she turned away her head, seemingly&#xD;
very much provoked, and said to Lord Gordon:&#xD;
*"It is strange that you never see anything in yer&#xD;
own son that is worthy of praise or admiration."&#xD;
"Indeed, I do, my wife," he said, looking at her&#xD;
proudly, for she was -still a very beautiful woman;&#xD;
"Gerald's career so far has pleased me greatly, espe-&#xD;
cially as he has .always been so weak and delicate."&#xD;
Here he gave a significant glance at me-.&#xD;
She seemed to be satisfied after this, and the .rest of&#xD;
tke evening passed pleasantly enough. We all retired&#xD;
early anxious for the night to be over that we could&#xD;
meet the dawning of the coming day, which arrived at&#xD;
last bright and cheering. I was awakened early by&#xD;
the chattering of the birds outside on the limbs of the&#xD;
trees, and by a sunbeam which stole in through an&#xD;
aperture in the shutter, and fell across- my eyes. I&#xD;
jumped up hurriedly, remembering the day, and went&#xD;
down to an early breakfast, for everyone seemed like&#xD;

.jpleasantly enug duing breakfast;  laorloi&#xD;
at her watch twenty times during the meal, to see when&#xD;
the hour would come that would bring her son. " Well,&#xD;
Eleanor," I asked, "howv many hours now before they&#xD;
will be here."&#xD;
"I don't know," sihe saidl, laughing. "I believe&#xD;
my watch has run down, the hands don't seem to have&#xD;
changed position since I looked at it last."&#xD;
" I suppose not," said Lord Gordon, smiling; " for&#xD;
you havn't given them timef&#xD;
V/c all three laughed at this, and then adjourned to&#xD;
the sitting-room whi~h overlooked the carriage road.&#xD;
I drew a comfortable chair to the window, and looked&#xD;
out upon the scenery around. Everything seemed to&#xD;
be lazily sleeping beneath the warm rays'of the June&#xD;
sun; even the great sea appeared slumbering, so idly&#xD;
and slowly. it was flowing a long with the sunbeams&#xD;
kissing its surface. But I was not thinking of all this;-&#xD;
my thoughts were with the boys that were coming&#xD;
back, and were now not far from us. I offered an&#xD;
inward prayer that their manhood would be spent&#xD;
more agreeably together than their childhood. My&#xD;
heart was right heavy on that day, when it should&#xD;
have~ been so light, and as I turned'to the centre table&#xD;
near which ,Eleanor was sitting leaning oveapic&#xD;
of fancy work, I sighed heavily, for there was te&#xD;
same face, the face of Eleanor Graham, beautiful still,&#xD;
but col and stern and unsoftened by years, or by&#xD;
trouble either, for in Eleanor's vocabulary this little&#xD;
word was missing. I turned agai-n 'to the window and&#xD;

waitedd patiently for the next half hour to elapse, l~ut&#xD;
I had not waited more than twenty minutes, when I&#xD;
saw two young horsemen cantering along the moorland&#xD;
road; my heart beat high, for I kne~v but too well who&#xD;
these were. As they caine up without breaking their&#xD;
lope to the Lodge gate, joyfully opened by the old&#xD;
porter, one of theni leaned his graceful figure for~vard&#xD;
and shook the 01(1 man's hand cordially, whilst the&#xD;
other gave a careless nod and came rapidly on~vards,&#xD;
and was soon in the arms of his mother. I shook&#xD;
G~rald warmly by both hands, ~elcoining him back to&#xD;
the Lodge, and then hastened to meet Paul, who&#xD;
jumped from his horse, and ran forward to meet me.&#xD;
"My noble boy 1"&#xD;
"My dear uncle!"&#xD;
lie was then clasped iii my arms; at length I&#xD;
pushed him from me to take a survey of his person,&#xD;
and a nobler form or a manlier face had rarely met&#xD;
eyeS.&#xD;
Paul, I am really proud of you."&#xD;
"I have worked hard to make you so, uncle," ~yhjlst&#xD;
a slight blush of pleasure suffused his cheek.&#xD;
"Bless you, n~y boy," It returned, as I led the way&#xD;
up the steps.&#xD;
Eleanor gave him her hand, saying, "flow are you&#xD;
Paul'?"&#xD;
"Very well, Aunt Eleanor, and am glad to see look-&#xD;
~o well," he answei'ed, as he shook her hand.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, I am feeling very well, thank you," and&#xD;
thi3 was all. But Lord Gordon was much more cor~&#xD;
dial; he met paul, saying:&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well, Paul, we are delighted to see you bacic, and&#xD;
many times welcome to Gordon; you are an honor to&#xD;
us all, olti fellow, and we are proud of you."&#xD;
"Oh, thank you," said Paul, his color brightening,&#xD;
"You honor me too much l)y saying this."&#xD;
"honor to whom honor is due, you know," replied&#xD;
Lord Gordon, and we walked to the sitting room,&#xD;
whcr6 Eleanor and Gerald had preceded us, and took&#xD;
our seats.&#xD;
Eleanor was. seated upon the sofa with her arms&#xD;
around Gerald, whose head rested upon her shoulder'&#xD;
it was still a fair head, with an abundance of light curls&#xD;
clustering about the blue-veined forehead; the express~&#xD;
~ton of the face was rather effeminate, and there was&#xD;
little about it that denoted character, strength, or vigor.&#xD;
his hand was as white and delicate as that of his&#xD;
mother's, which he was holding, calling her all the&#xD;
while by a dozen pet names, and telling her that all&#xD;
England would never make him stay so long away from&#xD;
her again, and saying, laughing:&#xD;
"I have not felt so much at lionie for the last six&#xD;
years."&#xD;
"Nor I' so happy, my son," said his mother; "and&#xD;
you certainly are not going away from me again; it is&#xD;
too great a pain to be separated from you."&#xD;
Anti she looked at liini with the old look of tender-&#xD;
ness, which her face wore whilst gazing upon her son,&#xD;
anti which I never saw there at any other time.&#xD;
And there they sat, he coaxing and scolding by turns,&#xD;
in a half-boyish way, for not bringing him home before,&#xD;
and saying that she was "never to let him go away&#xD;

again, and that there was nobody in tlu~ world like his&#xD;

Thus they carried on their conversation, whilst we&#xD;
sat some distance apart, speaking of various things,&#xD;
while Lord Gordon sat at an equal distance between the&#xD;
tWo, speaking first to his wife and thew to his son. Li&#xD;
the course of our conversation, Paul asked me about&#xD;
Amy and when she was coining. I answered by&#xD;
asking him if lie remembered her.&#xD;
"Indeed I do," he saki, "just as well as if it had&#xD;
been yesterday we parted."&#xD;
"I suppose she will be at home some time this sum-&#xD;
mer; at least Geraldine w~is hoping this whcn I saw&#xD;
her last."&#xD;
He was looking out the window whilst I was speak-&#xD;
ing, and happening to see his old dog, he exclaimed:&#xD;
"If there is not my old dog, looking j us~ as well as&#xD;
ever! I do wonder if he would know me?"&#xD;
I bade him lean forward and see. H~ did as lie was&#xD;
bid, saying:&#xD;
"Come here, old fellow."&#xD;
The dog, as he recognized the old. familiar tone~,&#xD;
lifted his head, wagged his tail, and whined with&#xD;
delight. Again Paul called:&#xD;
"Come here, Warder."&#xD;
rfhe dog jumped up, with two or three bounds&#xD;
reached the piazza, put his great l)a~vs upon the win-&#xD;
dow-sill and his nose almost in his master's face, and&#xD;
then leaped about and barked so furiously that he&#xD;
almost deafened us9 whilst Paul, to quiet him, stroked&#xD;
and patted him upon the- head. The rest of the time&#xD;

the faithful animal was content to lie under the window&#xD;
and watch his master's every movemeuL&#xD;
"Well, old boy" (this was Paul's usual manner of&#xD;
addressing him), "you would be a good teacher to many&#xD;
a fickle one in this world by your constancy and faith-&#xD;
fulness."&#xD;
There were so many questions to be asked and&#xD;
answer~d~ so many anecdotes to be told and so many&#xD;
servants to be spoken to whQ came to Welcome their&#xD;
young masters, that we foujul the (lay had almost&#xD;
passed before we knew it and night coming' on.&#xD;
Eleanor entertained lwr son after tea with a few songs,&#xD;
for her voice was still good, and at half after ten, the&#xD;
boys being tjred, we all arose, bade each other good&#xD;
night, and sought our separate chambers. This was a&#xD;
very pleasant beginning, and I trusted it would con-&#xD;
tinue so unto the end.&#xD;
The next evening Paul asked me if I would not&#xD;
walk with him to the cottage to see Geraldine. I&#xD;
answered "With all my heart," and we took our hats&#xD;
aii d went forth along the old familiar road which we&#xD;
h~d trod years before when lie was but a boy. But flow&#xD;
lv~ walked beside me almost as tall as myself; noble and&#xD;
graceful, and true to his manhood in every sense of the&#xD;
word. He was as unaffected as lie was when a boy,&#xD;
and our conversation was as easy and unrestrained as it&#xD;
was then. As we neared the cottage everything had a&#xD;
cheery and brighter, appearance than it had worn for&#xD;
these many years, when the little girl's silvery laugh&#xD;
rang out iii the yard and the little footsteps never tired&#xD;

The whole aspect of the cottage seemed to have under-&#xD;

the reason. As we reached the foot of the 5tC1), Ger~&#xD;
aldine came out on the piazza to meet us, with her sad&#xD;
Thee looking brighter and happier than I had seen it&#xD;
look for many a long day. Closely following her was&#xD;
- /&#xD;
a young girl of apparently some eighteen or nineteen&#xD;
summers, whom It instantly recognized as Amy, clothed&#xD;
in a pi~ctty, cool summer muslin, with a pink rose nest-&#xD;
I jug in hei' soft brown curL I do not think I ever&#xD;
beheld a fairer picture than she represented as she held&#xD;

and 1leasai~test accents:&#xD;
"What a charming me&amp;amp;tincr! How delighted I am&#xD;
to se3 you!~~&#xD;
"Of course I knew you, Paul," she said, in answer&#xD;
to his enquiry if' she would have reeognizecl him if he&#xD;
had come unaccompanied by mc. "Of ~ course you&#xD;
have grown and have changed to~ a greYit deal, but&#xD;
there is something about you \that I would ~have recog-&#xD;
n~zcKl, though I do not know what it ~&#xD;
"You know," she went on in a lively strain, "I have&#xD;
always considered you a hero, and ,you must have im-.&#xD;

and mc too, from a watery grave."&#xD;

"Indeed I will, whenever an oj)portunity presents&#xD;

"No, not you," lie answered, l)llt I would not mind&#xD;

Thus they were chatting away happily and freely,&#xD;
when my surprise was awakened to its fullest as I saw&#xD;
Gerald open the cottage gate and enter. He was invi-&#xD;
ted into the parlor l)y Geraldine and introduced to her&#xD;
daughter. Scarcely had lie taken his seat than he was&#xD;
follo~vcd by another visitor, and I thought it a most&#xD;
disagreeable intrusion when I recognized Godfrey&#xD;
Laughton. Geraldine and Ii sat apart watching this&#xD;
group of four, and I saw that Laughton was instantly&#xD;
sh ~uck with Amy's beauty and the simplicity of her&#xD;
m mners. I saw too that lie was d~terminecl to win her,&#xD;
ai~ d was then using all his powers of fascination to&#xD;
at tract her; aimd Gerald's susceptible heart was easily&#xD;
made captive; while Paul, who had loved her always,&#xD;
seemed to have that same faithfulness and constancy~&#xD;
which he the day before admired so much in his dog4&#xD;
I thought I noticed a little fear and a shrinking&#xD;
from Godfrey in Amy, and she seemed to observe, as I&#xD;
did long before, the restlessness in his eye and the&#xD;
unquietness in his manner. To Gerald she appeared&#xD;
somewhat indifferent, to my scrutinizing glance, though&#xD;

to another observed' sho would have appeared altogether&#xD;
attentive. I did not mark the impressioll that. Paul&#xD;
had made upon her, though I am very sure it must&#xD;
have been an agreeable one, for otherwise I would have&#xD;
noticed it. Ii 'think sh~ tried to conceal as mncli as&#xD;
possible her feelings and to treat the three gentlemen&#xD;
with the same degree of cordiality.&#xD;
The evening was very far advanced wThen we left the&#xD;
eott'io'e to return home. Godfrey Laughton, whom w~'&#xD;
had left behind, shortly after joined us, saying:&#xD;
* "'Ag my home lies in this direction, it will give mc~&#xD;
great pleasure to accompany you all that far" /&#xD;
"We will be pleasedd to have 'you," we all said in a&#xD;
voice, and silence for a few moments enstjed, which was&#xD;
l)rokcn by Gerald saying:&#xD;
"I think Amy Wayland is adorable!"&#xD;
"Ah ! indeed I" returned Laughton. "So your&#xD;
heart is taken captive already?~~&#xD;
"Oh! I do not think it is as bad as that," lie said,&#xD;
laugl~iing; "but she is truly very charming, and I will&#xD;
acknowledge that it is in danger,~~&#xD;
"What do you think of her, Mr. Steuai't?" Laugh~&#xD;
toii asked, patting Paul upon the shoulder. "Are you&#xD;
as. far gone as Sir Gerald?"&#xD;
I thought Paul a little offended at the rather light&#xD;
tones in which they spoke of Amy,. foil I had taught&#xD;
him all my life to venerate the fair sex, of' whom 'he&#xD;
had a most exalted ophuion; and though lie had not&#xD;
loved Amy, I think lie would hate been equally&#xD;
offended.&#xD;
~My Opinion of iWi&amp;amp;~ tJ4iy~nd is v~ very high one,"&#xD;
&#xD;
* he said. "I think her a most cha-rming young lady,&#xD;
an(l I admire her character even more than I do her&#xD;
face."&#xD;
"Oh ! " said Laughton, with quite a sinister sneer,&#xD;
I think you quite as much, if iiot more. enchanted&#xD;
than Sir Gerald ! "'&#xD;
"1)o you?" was the' cool reply, and the subject was&#xD;
ijot renewed again.&#xD;
At the p1ac'e of parting, as we were shaking hands&#xD;
With Godfrey, lie said&#xD;
"I hope you gentlemen will join my fishing excnr~&#xD;
sion on next Thursday and din&amp;amp; with me at ' Merry&#xD;
Gerald gladly accepted the invitation, but Paul&#xD;
slightly hesitated, when Laughton said:&#xD;
"I will take no excuse from you, Mr. Steuart," and&#xD;
waved his hand in adieu.&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE FIShING EXCURSION.&#xD;
lIE morning of the fishing party soon ar-&#xD;
rived. Paul seemed still to hesitate about&#xD;
going, when It asked him after breakfast,&#xD;
but I insisted upon it, for he was still a&#xD;
hard student, and 1 was anxious for him to take as&#xD;
much recreation as possible. ~He allowed himself&#xD;
but little, a walk to the ~cottage in the evening and an&#xD;
occasional hunt with his old (log being all, as lie w: ES&#xD;
just as fond of bringing d6wn a bird as aiiybocly, a~.d&#xD;
the old dog seemed just as ~iehighited at seeing his&#xD;
master with his gum as he was long ago when lie was&#xD;
young and full of life and strength.&#xD;
"You seem determined that I shall go, '~ said Paul,&#xD;
laughing, "and as you wish it so earnestly~ I will cer~&#xD;
tainly comply."              /&#xD;
$o in about an hour or two afterwards the boys&#xD;
started. I watched the two graceful figures out of&#xD;
sight, abA then 'took my accustomed seat on the veran-&#xD;
(lahi with my book, and Warder, with his nose at my&#xD;
feet, dozing in the sun.&#xD;
I was not an eye-witness to the occurrences of this&#xD;
chapter, but will relate them in the exact words in&#xD;
which they were told to me by a truthful and impartial&#xD;
witness.&#xD;
The young men reached "Merry Hall" a short time&#xD;
lifter leaving the Lodge. They were received in a&#xD;
most hospitable manner l~y the host, who ushered them&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, RETRiBLTTIOIN.         17T&#xD;
&#xD;
into a large, airy drawing-ro&amp;amp;m, where the company&#xD;
were assembled, entirely composed of' gentlemen, and&#xD;
apparently much at their ease, some lounA ng&#xD;
~    on velvet&#xD;
divans puffing away at cigars, and others formed into&#xD;
parties of cribbage, whist, and backgammon, stopping&#xD;
occasionally iii their games to drink the health, in the&#xD;
choicest wine, of the prettiest girls in the country.&#xD;
Why, gentlemen," he said, as the three entered the&#xD;
drawing-room together, "I had nearly come to the con-&#xD;
clusion that we were to b~ deprived of your delightful&#xD;
society to-day; and these gentlemen," pointing to the&#xD;
loungers and players, "as well as myself were bemoan-&#xD;
ing our fate mpst piteously."&#xD;
"Oh! as for me," answered Gerald, "I have been&#xD;
ready for an age, but this young man here," touching&#xD;
Paul, "is a fearful procrastinator."&#xD;
Yes," said Paul, smiling pleasantly, "I suppose II&#xD;
/ am in fault here, if there is any blame to be attached,&#xD;
for I was having a chat with my uncle, which detained&#xD;
me longer than Ii was aware of2'&#xD;
"Paul seems to be making a virtue of necessity In&#xD;
having these daily conversations."&#xD;
A dark frown contracted the young man's face thus&#xD;
spoken of; and his eyes flashed as lie turned to make a&#xD;
retort, but his attention was arrested by an exclamation&#xD;
from one of the chess players.&#xD;
"Why, Steuart, my boy, is it possible!"&#xD;
"Why, Leigh, well met! Where did you come&#xD;
from? Just from the tombs?"&#xD;
"iDo I look so ghostly?" replied the other, laughing.&#xD;
"No, not at all; but if T had seen the spirit of my&#xD;
grandfather I could not have been more surprised."&#xD;

"Perhaps I can make you think of the spirit of your&#xD;
grandmother too," said Leigh, as he pointed to a table&#xD;
where four y-oung men were engagedd at a rubber sof&#xD;
wh~ist.&#xD;
- "Well, as I1 live !" exclaimed Paul, "if there ain't&#xD;
Anthony Gay ! A gay meeting, truly," he continued,&#xD;
punin~g on the name.&#xD;
"' And a gay scene," said Eiglh, " for a gay boy is&#xD;
GayK''&#xD;
"sYes," said Anthony, whose attention was attracted&#xD;
from his game by hearing his name called so often, as&#xD;
he sprang front the table with both hands extended ;o&#xD;
Patid, "and we are going to have a gay time of it, boys,&#xD;
for the sight of you has made my heart as gay Od&#xD;
light as a bird's," and, he broke out singing the first t vo&#xD;
or three stanzas from Traviata:&#xD;
"Gaily; gaily through ifre wander,&#xD;
Cloud not our existence with' care," &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
" That's right, my friends," said Godfrey, coming&#xD;
up. " It is better to laugh than be sighing, and now&#xD;
whilst I 'think of it, life's moments are flying very&#xD;
rapidly and, we had better be away to the Isles, or I&#xD;
fear the fish will, be taking an after dinner's nap&#xD;
before we can get to them." He- looked at his, watch,&#xD;
and said: "I will llave the horses. ordered," and&#xD;
left them.&#xD;
The three young men were still standing in the floor&#xD;
laughing and talking, when they were somewhat&#xD;
startled by champagne corks flying in close proximity&#xD;
to their heads, anti turning they saw a party of about&#xD;
seven with sparkling wine cups raised to their lips,&#xD;

OR~, RETiRIBUITION.&#xD;
&#xD;
wvhilst a voice, which Paul knew but too well, was&#xD;
saying:&#xD;
"I propose a toast to old Wayland's daughter, the&#xD;
lprettiest girl in the country 0!"~&#xD;
The young man hearing this, gritted his teeth, anti&#xD;
shrugged his shoulders.&#xD;
" You don't belong to that party, Stcuart ?" asked&#xD;
Gay, as he nodded towards the seven.&#xD;
"No,"~ saidI Paul, emlphatically, shaking his head.&#xD;
" Nor you, Leigh ?" continued Gay, addressing the&#xD;
other.&#xD;
"Not I, indeed, sir," he returned, playfully.&#xD;
" Then as I think you are two of the best fellows I&#xD;
ever met, I shall join your standard, and we shall call&#xD;
ourselves ".The Thirsty Three," for I iust say it is a&#xD;
dry society you belong ,to."&#xD;
" Here, give me your hand, Anthony," said Paul,&#xD;
"fol' you are a mani after my own heart."&#xD;
"A worthy son of a worthy sire," added the third,&#xD;
as lie too heldl out his hand to Anthony.&#xD;
"And proud to be the friend of the worthy Steart,&#xD;
and the worthy Leigh'" lhe answered, as he shook&#xD;
wariinly both the extended hands.&#xD;
The announcement was then made that all was ready,&#xD;
anid they wended, their way to the sea where their little&#xD;
boats, whose sails had just been hoisted, were waitino-&#xD;
to receive them; it wVas not long before they were fairly&#xD;
launched on the waters, and many a net was thrown&#xD;
in the wvater to entrap the unsuspecting fish beneath.&#xD;
"I have caught the whale, boys," said Anthony, as&#xD;
he brought in a huge sea turtle; " I am going to send&#xD;

tell her I am going to help her make her Friday din.&#xD;

said, turning to Paul and Leigh. "Sire is going to&#xD;
give a fancy ball for her airy, fairy Lillian, and I sup-&#xD;
pose it" is .to be her turning-out affair, and we arc to&#xD;
have the jolly set of merry Andrews there," slapping&#xD;
a young man on the shoulders who had just brought&#xD;
in a huge salmon, and'whoi all the boys called Andy.&#xD;
"And' I can tell you who else is to be there," he con-&#xD;
tinued;- " that pretty little daughter of Captain Way+&#xD;
land's, and I tell you what it is, she's a beauty ; and&#xD;
I'll tell you something else too, that chap over there,&#xD;
Gerald Gordon, is as much in love with her) as he&#xD;
knows how to be, but he don't know how much, and&#xD;
what he does know will be too much for- his mother,&#xD;
for that boy must marry a princess, nothing else will&#xD;
do her."&#xD;
"Poor princess," said Leigh, amused, whilst Paul&#xD;
leaned over and played with the water, igoking some-&#xD;
what sad,'but he was too cheerful to look that. way&#xD;
long, and lie soon after turned to Anthony, and said:&#xD;
" Well, Gay, any more news ?"&#xD;
"No, nothing else, Only ybu came mighty hear tuiu-&#xD;
biing into the water just now, and when I caught you,&#xD;
saying, 'look out Steuart,. you'll be drowned,' you&#xD;
said, 'No matter~.' Do you know what -you were&#xD;
th'inking about ; if yTou don't, I do: you were think-&#xD;
ing about catching a fish and could not.,) Now 1k4t me&#xD;
tell you, for your "consolation,- what you must have&#xD;
heard ever since you were born, ' that there arc as good&#xD;
fish in the sea as ever were caught.'&#xD;
&#xD;
"WXell, gayest of the Gay," said Paul, laughing,&#xD;
"if It will be any satisfaction to you, I am consoledl."&#xD;
"If you are, I'm not, and won't be. until I get my&#xD;
diuner, for I'm awfully hungry ; and how is it with&#xD;
you, WValter ?" he asked, turning to Lord Leighi&#xD;
'"I don't know how it is, answered Leigh, "until I&#xD;
see what I aegot here," tugging away .at his net.&#xD;
"Isuppose it Is, that you would like fte to give you&#xD;
a; lift," said Anthony, winking roguishly, and stretch-&#xD;
ing forth his strong arm.&#xD;
"Anthony, you are the greatest case in all England,"&#xD;
replied Leigh, godhmrdy as our bottouched&#xD;
the island. Here Godfrey Laughton jumped from the&#xD;
boat, and made a graceful speech inviting the boys to&#xD;
land1, and leading them to a tastefully erected boxver,&#xD;
where a sumptuous repast was spread. They were all&#xD;
soon, as Anthony expressed&amp;amp; it, "hauling in dinner&#xD;
instead of fish." After refreshing themselves suffi-'&#xD;
ciently, Paul and Waiter Leigh walked off to a shady&#xD;
part of the island, and Threw themselves upon the"&#xD;
ground to have a friendly tete-a-tete. (They had 'been&#xD;
college friends and were still heart whole, though we&#xD;
)would not like to say faney free; could we have heard&#xD;
the frequent mention of Amy, and the airy, fairy Lil-&#xD;
lian (as Anthony has justly styled hier) which th ey&#xD;
made. They had. been lounging there for an hour,&#xD;
when Paul was interrupted by one of the party, call.'&#xD;

"Who wants me ?"&#xD;
"Gordon is in danger," answered the man, "and&#xD;

Paul leaped to his feet and hastened to the spot, fob&#xD;
lowed by Lord Leigh, and found ther9 two mcn ready&#xD;
for a duel, one, the heir of' Gordon, the other, Godfrey&#xD;
Laughton.&#xD;
"What are you going ~to do,". Paul asked, as he&#xD;
caine to Gerald's side.&#xD;
"Kill Laughtoll," was the short answer.&#xD;
"And this is the returil you make for hospitality&#xD;
received,'~ said Paul, a little contCmPtU0~lslY&#xD;
"Go away, and attend to yOtW OWII business," cried&#xD;
vpice; ,' it shall&#xD;
Gcrald, in an excite$l and intoxicated&#xD;
do as I please."&#xD;
"Not this time,' said Paul, firmly, taking the pistol&#xD;
out of his nervoUS, trembling hand. "Sit down and&#xD;
make a man of yourself', no one but a coward fights a&#xD;
duel."&#xD;
These words seemed to appease Gerald, and* Paul&#xD;
raised his voice, saying&#xD;
"I'll leave it to the party. Are these gentlemen fit&#xD;
subjects for dueling?"&#xD;
"And' I answer in the name of' all," said Lord&#xD;
lL~igh, ",and say that they are not."&#xD;
"And I, and~ I, aiid I," sai&amp;amp; a dozen otl~rs.&#xD;
"Then seconds your servic~S are no longer needed,'~&#xD;
Paul said, addressing the gentlemen who had volun-&#xD;
teered this office.&#xD;
Laughton was not so easily gained over as heraldd&#xD;
and was actually 'foaming with rage; but at length&#xD;
'Paul, by persuasion and firmness, succeeded ii~ quiet-&#xD;
ing him.&#xD;
"A brave man is 'that~. Stenart," said one of the&#xD;
party te acoInpaflion.&#xD;

"Ftutli, that he is" he answered. "I \vould not&#xD;

As they were preparing to leave t~e island, Paul in~&#xD;
quired of' Anthony Gay the cause of the disaoTeement.&#xD;

in the library and parlor, and throughout the whole&#xD;
J~od~e an air of comfort prevailed.&#xD;
I threw my cloak over my shoulders and walked to&#xD;
Geraldine's, but folUld them all abs~ent. I kaflWd&#xD;
that Amy was out riding with Gerald notwithstanding&#xD;
the inclemency of the evening.&#xD;
"Gerald,' said Nellie, " had insisted upon her going&#xD;
and would take no excuse,, for the engagement had&#xD;
been. made ~omc days before, and Geraldine had gone&#xD;
to visit a poor peasant woman who had a very sick&#xD;
child, to ofi~r consolation."&#xD;
I retraced my steps homeward through the woods,&#xD;
crushing the scrod leaves as I went, with the winds&#xD;
every ~ow and then playing bandy with my hat, till I&#xD;
was compelled to use my hands, which I placed on the&#xD;
top of my head, and then. bade them defiance. When&#xD;
I reached the Lodge, I[ hung my cloak and hat upon&#xD;
the rack hi the Hall and walked into the Library.&#xD;
There sat Paul in the gloaming before the cheerful&#xD;
grate, his large dog b~~id~ him with his head. upon. his&#xD;

"There is something you are keeping from, me, Paul,&#xD;

I think he was much comforted by the time our&#xD;
conversation ended, and he was -just as determined, if'&#xD;

ton's to learn when our next hunting party would&#xD;
come off."&#xD;
After this, Gerald remained silent, when Paul asked,&#xD;
a little spitefully&#xD;
"how did you leave them all the cottage, Gerald?"&#xD;
seeing that Gerald was~ not going to acknowledge his&#xD;
visit there.&#xD;
Eleanor, whose face was wreathed in smiles, now&#xD;
re(ldened, ami she said angrily : -&#xD;

"My son does not the cottage."&#xD;
"I am sorry you do not know your son as well as I&#xD;
do," Paul retorted.&#xD;
"What do you mean by this, sir," said Gerald, rising,&#xD;
whilst the veins in his temple were swollen with anger.&#xD;
'E ~erely what my words contained. If you are&#xD;
ashamed to acknowledge your visit to a lady and to a&#xD;
lady's house, I ani not ashamed to tell it; for you."&#xD;
"No matter where my son visits, sir," ptit; in Eleanor,&#xD;
"it is not your place to bring him to an account for it&#xD;
and you shall never do it ao'~lin&#xD;
"That was not my intention, madam," said Pad,&#xD;
equally provoked, and rising from the sofa upon whh&#xD;
he was lounging, "but I say when a man is ashamed&#xD;
to say that he visits a lady that ho does visit, that maut's&#xD;
intentions are dishonorable, and that he is not a ge a-&#xD;
tieman."&#xD;
He then left the room to walk upon the piazza to&#xD;
cool his temper, for temper was his great fault, and I&#xD;
was not surprised to see him a little while after take.&#xD;
his hat and walk away in the direction of the cottage.&#xD;
That evening later, when I saw two forms walking&#xD;
along the beach---a graceful girl and a noble-looking&#xD;
man-~-I felt; that all was going well; an(l when Paul&#xD;
returned that night and told m6 simply that he had&#xD;
asked her to be his wife, and that she, with all a&#xD;
woman's confidence, had given him her love, I thanked&#xD;
God for making. the boy so happy; the sky seemed so&#xD;
peaceful and. tranquilly bright, for our hearts were at&#xD;
peace.&#xD;

JOhN MAKES A GREAT MISTAKE.&#xD;
&#xD;
TOLD Eleanor in a day or two our secret.&#xD;
Perhaps it was not advisable in mc to&#xD;
1~ have done so, but I thought it was nothing&#xD;
more than my duty, as she was the only&#xD;
female relative that Paul had, and she should have&#xD;
stood to him in the light of a mother. I thought,&#xD;
too, that it would ease her mind as regarded Gerald,&#xD;
for she was making herself very miserable about him,&#xD;
for fear lie would fall in love with Amy. I heard him&#xD;
tell her one day, when they had some words about her,&#xD;
that if he chose he would marry her anyhow; that she&#xD;
could not prevent him, nor his father either. When I&#xD;
told her of Paul's engagement, there wa~ an expression&#xD;
in her face which for the first time in my life I failed&#xD;
to understand; and I noticed that during the following&#xD;
days she was colder, if possible, in her manners to&#xD;
Paul, and she still wore the expression that I did not&#xD;
understand.&#xD;
I remember one day, whilst sitting in the front ver~&#xD;
andah, that I noticed Amy's graceful figure coming&#xD;
towards the Lodge. I had scarcely time to b&amp;amp; sur-&#xD;
prised at this when she reached the foot of the stairs,&#xD;
saying:&#xD;
"Good morning, uncle" (for she always called me&#xD;
that). "Why ain't you. up and about this glorious&#xD;
day? Why, the very birds seem to be inviting you&#xD;

"No, "-shaking her head and smiling significantly.&#xD;
"If I were on that you would not think I would turn&#xD;
my steps in this direction, wouki you?"&#xD;
"No," I replied, smiling too, and waited for an&#xD;
explanation.&#xD;
"I came to see Lady Gordon. Is she at home?"&#xD;
"Come in, then, and I will have her here in a few&#xD;
I rang for a servant, and told him to tell Lady Gor~&#xD;
don that Miss Wayland was waiting to see her.&#xD;
The domestic bowed and left, and. in a few moments&#xD;
Eleanor appeared. She greeted Amy. most cordially&#xD;
(which much surprised me), and took a seat beside her&#xD;
on the sofa. I was not a little delighted and pleased&#xD;
to see with what perfect ease and grace little Amy chat-&#xD;
ted away to this Lady Gordon whom so many held in&#xD;
awe. After awhile she told Eleanor that she had come&#xD;
on a very charitable expedition; that both she and&#xD;
Lillian Grantly had been authorized to go about and&#xD;
collect alms for several poor families who had been&#xD;
burnt out of house and home the. night previous, and&#xD;
who were now in actual destitution. Any assistance&#xD;
that Lady Gordon would render would be most thank-&#xD;
fully received.&#xD;
"I will most gladly assist you," Eleanor answered,&#xD;
with more warmth than she~ had used for years; "but&#xD;
pray, Miss Wayland, sit longer," as Amy rose to go.&#xD;
"No, thank you, Lady Gordon; my mission is not&#xD;
yet accomplished by any means." Amy then bowed&#xD;

WOUld make the angels weep."&#xD;
"That you ~vill never do," I replied, holding, the&#xD;
small hand.&#xD;
"01'! you dont know. .1 am very naughty some-&#xD;

"Not for your faults," returned Lillian; "they only&#xD;

"Because you are a little angel yourself; Lillian, you&#xD;

" Well, this is decidedly the most complimentary&#xD;

as he sprang lightly ovcr a fence near us, with his gun&#xD;
pon his shoulder and a couple of dogs following him.&#xD;
"Miss Amy, I must admire your penetration and&#xD;
judgment;" but while lie addressed Amy, he looked&#xD;
ifltQ the 'soft blue eyes of the young countess with a&#xD;
depth of love which was not intended for either Amy&#xD;
or I to understand, but under which the pretty little&#xD;
creature blushed and smiled, saying:&#xD;
"So you have been an eavesdropper, 'Walter? It's&#xD;
a wonder you did not hear something about yourseW&#xD;

"That is what I was listening for," lie said, laugh-&#xD;

CHAPTER XXII.&#xD;
&#xD;
LADY GIRA ~TLYS FANCY BALL.&#xD;
the night of the ball, came at&#xD;
last. There was a great deal of excitement&#xD;
~llURSDAY,&#xD;
at the Lodge, for wQ were all going, bX~t&#xD;
none in costume, except the boys. Eleanor&#xD;
asked me in the evening what my costume was to be.&#xD;
"That of a gentleman" I answered, bowing gravely,&#xD;
"for it is not ne~essarY for me to assume a character,&#xD;
like it seems to be for the others," I continued, with&#xD;
mock gravity.&#xD;
We all laughed, and Eleanor told me that I had my&#xD;
share of self~appreciation.&#xD;
We did not see the boys in their costumes, for they&#xD;
sent us word that they would see us at the ball, an~&#xD;
left in the pony carriage before we were quite ready.&#xD;
Everything was superbly arranged at the Grantly&#xD;
Manor. I felt that I was going into fairyland as I&#xD;
went into the dancing saloons and parlors.&#xD;
"Blue spirits in white, red spirits.ifl grey,&#xD;
All mingled, mingled, mingTled."&#xD;
There were dashing cavaliers, bold knights, officers,&#xD;
bold marshals, princes, and kings; while beautifully-&#xD;
robed princesses, court ladies, and graceful dames of&#xD;
high degree were dancing, laughing, talking, and chat-~&#xD;
ting with daring brigands, corsairS, fanciful troubadours,&#xD;
country belles, flower girls, nymphs, and fairies. Mrs.&#xD;
Partington and Paul Pry enjoyed a cozy chat on a tet&amp;amp;&#xD;

Richard Cceur de Leon ~ while Meg Merrilles and&#xD;
Madge Wildfire were carrying on sly flirtations with a&#xD;
French grenadier and Sir Walter Raleigh; and Ger-&#xD;
man and Roman peasant girls were bandying repartee&#xD;
with Ravenswood arid Monte Cristo; while pale,&#xD;
pretty Lucy Ashton was standing apart, talking in a&#xD;
lively strain to Dogberry; and Stradella stood in his&#xD;
velvet mantle, whispering words of love to his Leo~&#xD;
nora. You could see anywhere groups of Romeos and&#xD;
Juliets, 9thcllos and Desdernonas, ilarlequins, and&#xD;
Merry Ahdre~vs in the mazes of the dance, with Helen&#xD;
McGregor, Undines, and even a little Topsy, who was&#xD;
impudent enough to take her place and smile on a fas~&#xD;
cinating knight. And there was the terrible Katharina&#xD;
still shaking at Petruchio, and vowing that the moon&#xD;
W~tStli~ sun.&#xD;
I sat a little apart with some old friends, and gazed&#xD;
with delight on this enchanting scene. I had not as&#xD;
yet seen any of our party, the crowd being so dense;&#xD;
but presently I caught sight of Lillian, and indeed she&#xD;
was an airy fairy in her dress of white gossamer, car-&#xD;
rying a beautiful little wand, which she was playfully&#xD;
waving over the head of a Cinderella. I heard many&#xD;
remarks made upon her beauty and simplicity, and&#xD;
really there was much to admire in this lovely chars'&#xD;
acter.&#xD;
My attention was attracted from. her to a couple who&#xD;
were walking towards a door which led to the conser~&#xD;
~'atory. Ii leaned ~brward to get a better vie~v, but I&#xD;

&#xD;
~ouId not see their faces. The gentleman was attired&#xD;
in. the handsome dress of the Knight of St. John, while&#xD;
the girl wore a Greek costume. They passed on through&#xD;
the door, and I did not see them for some time after-&#xD;
wards. Presently I heard the following remarks from&#xD;
some of the bystanders, and as they concerned little&#xD;
Amy, I was all attention.&#xD;
"They say old Wayland's daughter i~ here some-&#xD;
where, and that she is a perfect beauty. But let us find&#xD;
out this Wayland contagion. I want to see her."&#xD;
"And you will be sure to catch it, like most of the&#xD;
young men to-night. But come on; let us go and bo&#xD;
introduced to her."&#xD;
These two passed out of hearing, but an Eastern&#xD;
princess standing near speaking to a French field-mar-&#xD;
shal took up the subject.&#xD;
"I suppose you have seen 4hat very pretty girl, the&#xD;
daughter of old Captain Wayland, whom everybody&#xD;
says is such a case. Their live' in the cottage that is in&#xD;
that cool, shady grove. It is a pretty place enough I&#xD;
dare say, but so tiny that one would suppose it was&#xD;
made for a doll baby. I am sure I should suffocate&#xD;
~had I to liv~e in a place so small. I cannot see for the&#xD;
life of me how people can exist in such' small places."&#xD;
"Yes, it is very distressing," said the other, in what&#xD;
I thought to be a very sneering voice4 '~ I am very&#xD;
sure your Royal Highness could never be content with&#xD;
'love in a cottage.&#xD;
"Ah! no, indeed; it must be on a larger scale or I&#xD;
never should survive it. But let me beg you, Mon-&#xD;
sieur, not to be sarcastic."&#xD;
&#xD;
196&#xD;

"Why, no, your Highness, I had no such intention.&#xD;
1 do not know the lady in question, but I should like&#xD;
very much to become acquainted with her."&#xD;
"And that you shall," said a third, stepping np-a&#xD;
knight with a waving plume-" for I myself will intro-&#xD;
Thee you; that is, if I can find hcr~ I have her name&#xD;
down for a set, and must begin my search, for I cannot&#xD;
afford to miss the pleasant opportunity of spending a&#xD;
half hour with so charming a lcrson as Miss Amy."&#xD;
Then the three walked away, but IL did not fail to&#xD;
recognize in the independent gait of the man who had&#xD;
last spoken our old friend, Anthony Gay.&#xD;
I soon tired of this gay, bright scene, for my spirits&#xD;
were not exactly in kceping~witIi it. So after partaking&#xD;
of the refreshments, I ~vent up stairs to a little harp room&#xD;
which stood at the end of a long corridor; the room&#xD;
w ~s small and prettily arranged, and hung with green&#xD;
]~ mask. The harp was pushed into one corner un~&#xD;
c~ ~rcred, and near it a music staid on which a pile of&#xD;
sh ~et music was lying. I turned over several of these&#xD;
sh gets, and as II came to the last I found an 01(1 bal-.&#xD;
lad, "Hours there were to memory dearer." AhI&#xD;
wi ~at did it bring back to m~? The remembrance of&#xD;
a 'toice that was long hushed and at rest, which used,&#xD;
in plaintive tones, to sing this; every word of that 01(1&#xD;
song brought back to me "bright Visions of the past."&#xD;
I again, in thought, went over that period of my early&#xD;
manhood, remembering those sunny smiles, and nearly&#xD;
every word those lips had uttered, and as IL read this&#xD;
rtanza in the song:&#xD;

IL kid (lown the sheet, and pasSC(l my hand t~vo ot&#xD;
three times over my brow to shut out the visions of&#xD;
years ago. I then walked to the window and draw-&#xD;
ing back the heavy curtains,~ took my seat in the&#xD;
deep embrasure, drew the curtains to again, and looked&#xD;
out on the night. The sea was flo~viug slowly on,&#xD;
silvered by the moon's pale rays, while all around&#xD;
was peaceful and serene, except from below, where I&#xD;
could still hear the strains of music a2~ the dancers'&#xD;
merry feet, and I knew the revelry was still at its&#xD;
height. I was glad to be alone here in this quiet spot,&#xD;
and had determined to enjoy its solitude. I had takeii&#xD;
out a cigar with the intention of lighting it, when a&#xD;
slight, noise in the room awakened my attention; a cou-&#xD;
j)lC entered, a lady and a gentleman. When I saw them&#xD;
through a slight opening iii the c~irtain, they were&#xD;
standing, in the centre of the room, at a little table,&#xD;
and lie was pouring out for her a glass of water. I&#xD;
saw that it was the Knight of St. John and the Greek&#xD;
girl; but what was my astonishment1 when, turning&#xD;
their faces towards me, I recognized Paul and Amy.&#xD;
I don't knQw why I did not address them but it&#xD;
seemed to me I had lo~t the i)ower either to speak or&#xD;
move; perhaps it was the troubled expression I saw&#xD;
in the face of one, and the anxiety depicted on the&#xD;
face of the other that kept me sileiit. They took a&#xD;
seat on a little velvet divan, and reluctantly I heard&#xD;
the following short conversation:&#xD;
'K , Amy, you must tell me what he said. to you,&#xD;
for Gerald Gordon is no friend of mine, Perhaps I&#xD;
~tn~ more uneasy thaim may be necessary about all these&#xD;
&#xD;
199&#xD;
&#xD;
things, but YOU are so very dear to me, that it may&#xD;
be this that makes me so."&#xD;
"I wish I hadn't said anything to you about it,&#xD;
Paul, for you worry yourself so unnecessarily. Don't&#xD;
you know that all Gerald Gordon could say in a life-&#xD;
time would not affect me, me that you call your daunt-&#xD;
less Amy?"&#xD;
"I know that, but still it is only right that you&#xD;
should tell mc everything, for we have more enemies&#xD;
than friends just now."&#xD;
"Oh! I am so sorry, Paul, that I said anything to&#xD;
you about it. You xviii just worry yourself to death."&#xD;
"Nay, my darling," lie answered, tenderly, "if this&#xD;
would be my only trial, I would most gladly submit&#xD;
to it, 1)ut I I-"&#xD;
Here she finished the sentence, saying:&#xD;
"Why, you arc so superstitious."&#xD;
"No, I am not that, but even if I were I have had&#xD;
no reason for such gloomy indulgence; but if you&#xD;
knew the world and its people like II do, you too would&#xD;
be restless and uneasy."&#xD;
They were silent for a few moments, when Paul&#xD;
SPoke:&#xD;
"You ~ tell nie what Gerald said to you,&#xD;
Amy?"&#xD;
"Oh ! yes, I will, iC you insist upon it?&#xD;
~'" Then I do insist upon it," he answered.&#xD;
"Very well. When he asked me to be his wife,&#xD;
and I told him I coul(l not and would not, lie said,&#xD;
desperately, that I should, and that he had the means&#xD;
in his own hands, and cost what it would, that Ii&#xD;
should be his wife."&#xD;

" Then it shall cost him his life," said Paul ,rising&#xD;
to his feet, and trembling with emotion.&#xD;
A faintness seemed to come over me as I heard these&#xD;
words, but I sjill had not the power to move.&#xD;
Oh ! Paul, Paul," said the girl, '" do sit down and&#xD;
dent get SO tiiig'Vy. it cannot injure us U() matter what&#xD;

"Auw," he said, taking his place by her side, and&#xD;
resuming hi~ tender tone, dearly as 1 1&#xD;
"as            OVC yOU,&#xD;
would rather see you sleeping quietly l)encatll I he flow-&#xD;

them high and lOW,&#xD;
"i)on't von know your are~ to be our vis-a-vis ~.w&#xD;

They answered him, both assuming very gay tones,&#xD;
and the three descended to the iancing-ro6mns together.&#xD;
When II was~ again alone, I felt as if every object&#xD;
was swimming around. and if had not gained entire&#xD;
command over myself, when a second couple entered&#xD;
the harp rc~om. What was ~my surprise, and displea-&#xD;
sure too this time, when I recognized Capt. Waylaid&#xD;
and Eleanor. They took their seats on the sofa that&#xD;
the two' young people had just vacated.&#xD;
This wily, artful woman, and this world-hardened&#xD;
man. I was as unable, as I was before, to move or&#xD;
say anything, or I would not have listened to the~r~&#xD;
conversation, for I felt that it was not right, arid iii&#xD;
my inmost soul knew that it boded no good, but the&#xD;

nightmare that possessed me would not Ict me leave,&#xD;
or make them eons~ious of my presence.&#xD;
E1eai~or opened the conversation, by saying:&#xD;
"This affair has, for a long time, engaged my atten-&#xD;
twa and intei;cst. it is needless for me to say to you&#xD;
how very dear your daughter is to me. She is so very&#xD;

&#xD;
TROUBLE FOR PAUL AM) A1'~tY.&#xD;
[~~'~i lIE next morning~ I awoke front a feverish&#xD;
b&#xD;
and unquiet sleep, my dreams had beeti so&#xD;
frightful that I prefcri~el getting up early,&#xD;
though no one in the house was yet astir.&#xD;
Being fatigued front the last nights (lissipatlon, I&#xD;
threw open my shutter and the first carol of&#xD;
the early l)irds, and the cool morning breezes which&#xD;
fanned .rny burning brow. As I said, my r1rca~ is&#xD;
the night before had been very frightful, and thl')T,&#xD;
'together with the two conversations I had heal d,&#xD;
left me in a state of nervous excitement. But after&#xD;
I had said my prayers, and refreshed myself by a&#xD;
cool bath, I felt much more corn posed, and was al le&#xD;
to take my book and my accustomed plane near t ~ie&#xD;
window, and to read until the sun had kissed the d~w&#xD;
drops from the flowers, an(l my little repeater on the&#xD;
mantle told me it was the hour of eleven. Then all&#xD;
were awake at the Lodge, but 1 did not leave' i ay&#xD;
room, for the view from my window was so beaut~ u1&#xD;
that I could sit for hours and look at it. Presei~tiy&#xD;
there came a tap at my door, and I bade the visitUP&#xD;
enter. I was not surprised when the door opened to&#xD;
see that it was Paul, for there was ~carcely a morniiig&#xD;
that he did not come to greet rue, and to ask me how&#xD;
I was. But I was surprised when I looked up into&#xD;
his face to see a frown upon hi~ brow, an(l white lines&#xD;
about his mouth which denoted great pain. his step&#xD;
&#xD;
I.&#xD;
&#xD;
was as firm an(l as stea(ly, and there wa~ no tremor in&#xD;
his voice and his hand as lie handed me an open note&#xD;
and asked mc to read it; he theh drew a chair,, near&#xD;
the window, and leaning his head upon his hand,&#xD;
looked wearily out upon the moorland. I took the /&#xD;
note, which had been written by a trembling, nervous&#xD;
hand, and read the following disconnected lines&#xD;
"Oh! Paul, Paul, it seems as if Iod's mercy is estranged from&#xD;
me this morning. how am I tell you what happened' last night&#xD;
whilst we were pligliting anew our vows. You seemed to have&#xD;
seen in the future what I could not. Come to me, if you can,&#xD;
after breakfast, and I will tell you all; but one little word to you,&#xD;
my noble Paul, I am your 'dauntless Amy ' yet, and shall be true&#xD;
to The last."&#xD;
"The poor child, the Poor chili," I thought, "what&#xD;
can I do for her. God help them 1)0th."&#xD;
"Never mind, my boy," I said, as I drew my chair&#xD;
closer to him, and laid my hand upon his shoulder.&#xD;
"Never mind, it may not all l)C as bad as you think&#xD;
it is."&#xD;
"Do you know what it is?" he said, turning&#xD;
towards me, with burning cheeks, and flashing eye.&#xD;
"YesI know what it is all about."&#xD;
"And then you tell me noUc mind."&#xD;
it was the first irritable word he ever spoke to me.&#xD;
Ille rose front his seat, and with that same determined&#xD;
step, and that s~arne firm look I had noticed iii the&#xD;
library on that November evening when lie spoke of&#xD;
Amy and Gerald, and paced the room several times&#xD;
and thieii left it, shutting the door violently behind&#xD;
him, and walked across the passage t~ his own chain-&#xD;
bei'. 11 sat for a few moments only after he had left&#xD;

GORDON LODGE;&#xD;
&#xD;
I~ I&#xD;
&#xD;
me. it was not a man to idle away time in thinking.;&#xD;
I was soon up and doing. I crossed over to his room,&#xD;
and told him in a very determined manner that he&#xD;
must go right away to Amy's, see Capt. Wa~rland, and&#xD;
remind him oC the promise he had. made him some&#xD;
weeks before, and see Amy too, and try in some way&#xD;
to arrange matters so that they would be less disagree-&#xD;
able. This was his intention anyway.; or, otherwise,&#xD;
in hi~ present mood, he might have been a little rebel-&#xD;
liotis. lie took up his hat withoUt saying a word,&#xD;
and we walked out together. I told him to meet me&#xD;
at the beach, that I would await him there, then bade&#xD;
God bless him, and watched his retreating figure out&#xD;
of sight.&#xD;
When I reached the beach, It walked hastily up and&#xD;
down, feeling tired ~enough of life now, and trying to&#xD;
rack my brain for some expedient by which I could&#xD;
free these two young beings, who were ~o dear t~ my&#xD;
heart, ~'rom their oppresSiolb To have - spoken to&#xD;
1~Aeanort would have been a little less tha1n lunacy; she&#xD;
was doing her work, and III saw that she was determined&#xD;
to do it well; and old Wayland-i knew the man too&#xD;
well~would have sacri aced the heart of his poor young&#xD;
birding to have seen her mistress of the rich lands of&#xD;
Gordon. What was' it to him her paling cheeks and&#xD;
tearful eye? the title woukl mend all that. "Ah! this&#xD;
tyrannical father, this brutal husband I"' I sighed&#xD;
wearily, as Ill thought of the little use of appealing to~&#xD;
him. Poor Amy! poor Paul! I wished that this mur-&#xD;
muring sea would bear us a~vay on its bosom to some&#xD;
unknown land, where we would be at rest. I turned&#xD;
&#xD;
from the great heaving waters to meet the poor boy as&#xD;
I espied him coIning towards me. I saw disappoint.-&#xD;
meiit and grief depicted in every alinement of his face.&#xD;
"\Yell, Paul, what was your success?"&#xD;
"All gloomy enough, uncle," he ans~vercd drearily.&#xD;
"I would not mind myself so ihuch; but poor Amy!"&#xD;
At this he broke down completely and threw himself&#xD;
in desperation upon the sand, looking gloomily over&#xD;
the unbroken waters.&#xD;
" Amy,'~ he continued, afier a pause, "told mc that&#xD;
he~ father vowe(1 that these nuptials shall take place in&#xD;
the chapel at Gordon on the 21st of this month-ten&#xD;
days from to-day."&#xD;
We shall see," I heard him say tinder his breath,&#xD;
He then spoke aloud&#xD;
" I made every effort in my power to see Captain&#xD;
W.tyland, but lic~ took good care to keep out of my&#xD;
way, sending me word that it was irot worth while to&#xD;
tal k the matter over; that he was determined; his mind&#xD;
was irrevocably made up, an ci it would only be a dis...&#xD;
ag7ceable interview."&#xD;
Ii saw the boy clench his hands so tightly he: e that&#xD;
th~ nails penetrated the flesh, and I felt very safe at&#xD;
that moment in not being Capt~iin Wavlan~d. He pres.-&#xD;
ently rose to lis feet, and we took our way back to the&#xD;
Lodge in silence. I felt that we would have to weather&#xD;
this storm, and I ~)rayed inwardly that, with a Chris.-&#xD;
tian resignation, my boy would bear the wrongs he&#xD;
would have to endure. "God tempers the wind to the&#xD;
shorn lamb," was the only remark I ventured to make&#xD;

I saw Lord Gordon look after his retreating figure,&#xD;
then at Eleanor and gerald, and then at me, and as hit;&#xD;
glance was not returned, we finished our breakfast in&#xD;
silence&#xD;
I sat toyifl~ wjth my spoon, l)alaflcing it tij)Oi1 the&#xD;
edge of my cup, whilst my thoughts were busy upon&#xD;
other thmo~s I resolved to ~'o an(l see Geraldine, to&#xD;
try if anything could be done. So, after we rose i'roin&#xD;
the table, I walked hurriedly to the cottage. When I&#xD;
knocked at the cottage door, it was opened to me by&#xD;
old Nellie. Marks of recent weeping had swollen her&#xD;
kind old. eves, and my own voice was husky when I&#xD;
asked for her mistress, at seeing the old woman there&#xD;
with hcr sympathizing face. She led me to her nus-&#xD;
tress' room in silence.. There, lying on a cottage bed,&#xD;
was the fond, doting mother, pale and tearless, speak-&#xD;
ing wor{15 of comfort to her only. child. Indeed it&#xD;
pleased me much to see the 'little Amy bearing all thi:;&#xD;
with true patience, though she was as pale as a lily, and&#xD;
her mouth find her lips were compressed; but there was&#xD;
spirit in her eyeM, and II knew that it was no weak char-&#xD;
&#xD;
acter they had to deal wit Ii ; only (1~WO duriiv" that v4t&#xD;
did I see a look come I rito her face which was so weary&#xD;

"iNever niind me," the g ri answered slowly.&#xD;

"No, no. I ~d. not suppose anything will. ife&#xD;

"I wonder if lie will see me?"&#xD;
"I f~ar not. lie positively refused to se.~ Paul, and&#xD;
ii ~u p pose you will fare no better."&#xD;
en I will compel him," was my answer.&#xD;
But I was not so good as my word, for the man&#xD;
evadd me as a fi.~h does a hook for the next week, nor&#xD;
did I see him until the ten days had elapsed. And&#xD;
now, as I think over it, it might~have been so much&#xD;
better that I did not, for heaven only knows what might&#xD;
have been the consequence, as my indignation and con-&#xD;

I had risen early and sought Paul in his chamber.&#xD;
He was sitting by one ~f his windows in his dressing-&#xD;
gown, and I knew 1w the haggard expression on his&#xD;
face and The dimness of his eyes that sleep had failed&#xD;
to visit him the night before. I sat by and tried to&#xD;
console him and make him think that it was all for the&#xD;
best that he should be so stricken. He shrugged his&#xD;
shoulders a little annoyed, saying:&#xD;
"II)o you suppose I am going to let this thing go on&#xD;
without making some resistance?"&#xD;
I thought the boy's mind was wandering a little, and&#xD;
t~~ed to turn the conv~rsation into a different channel;&#xD;
but I still noticed that old determined look in his face,&#xD;

and a~gry voices from below. I rushed down stairs&#xD;

There befor~ inc stood the two young men. Paul was&#xD;
clasping one of Gerald's hands, in which was a loaded&#xD;
revolver, while with the other he was holding back old&#xD;
Patrick, who, with tears in his eyes, was trying to part&#xD;
theni. They were both erimsoued with rage and excite-&#xD;

~[IE DEATH OF GERALD.&#xD;
&#xD;
&amp;amp;~I7 HE ninth day da~vned bright and warm, but&#xD;
1~&#xD;
sultry and Ol)iWeS3i ye. The sun was s'~ warm&#xD;
Q. S~, that every living thing vent to the shade.&#xD;
~ Even the cattle sought SOHIC leafy bough to&#xD;
shelter them from the burning rays. It seemed too&#xD;
warni Itr tli~ bees to gather honey front the flowers;&#xD;
c~en if they had attempted it they would have been&#xD;
disappointed, for the leaves were withering and closing&#xD;
beneath the August sun. 'Twas the 20th of the month,&#xD;
and to~morrow-oh ! would that to-morrow would&#xD;
never come!&#xD;
Our breakfast was eaten in as perfect silence ti tis&#xD;
morning as on the morning after Ihe ball. Some ti~ ac&#xD;
after we had finished, Ge~'ald met his mother in the&#xD;
hall, saying:&#xD;
"Mamma, I'm going to B- this morning. Ii have&#xD;
been iff~tending going for some time, and think this is&#xD;
just as good as any. I want to see some old friends&#xD;
there anyhow, and you know if I do not ~o to-day I&#xD;
will not have another chance."&#xD;
"But, my darling, you will burn up if you attempt&#xD;
it. For pity sake, do not go.&#xD;
"Oh! yes, I must~ You knew I am not sugar;&#xD;
there is no danger of my melting"&#xD;
"But II do not wan~you to go, my son," persisted&#xD;
the mother. "I want you with me to-day. Do not~&#xD;
go~ my dearest," she entreated4 "I will feel so anxious&#xD;
&#xD;

if you go away fro~n me. And besides, I will see so&#xD;
little of you in the next f~w months. You will go&#xD;
then, my son?" she continued, as she saw him buck-&#xD;
ling on his spurs.&#xD;
"Yes, I will, mamma. You speak as if you were&#xD;
going to lose me altogether. I am sure I will be a~&#xD;
much with you after I am married as I am now.&#xD;
Besides, I mast go."&#xD;
"I amvery, very sorry to see you so determined,&#xD;
my boy. I would much rather you would not leave&#xD;
rue. I do not feel very well, and if you go it will only&#xD;
make me worse."&#xD;
"I do not see what my going has to do with your&#xD;
health, mamma. I dare say you will feel better&#xD;
presently."&#xD;
"And will nothing keep you, my de~ar sos.?" she&#xD;
asked once more, so earnestly that II really felt for her.&#xD;
"Nothing," was the short answer, and shortly after&#xD;
this, I saw him' mount his horse, and his mother went&#xD;
up to him, saying, for the last time:&#xD;
"Do notgo, my son."&#xD;
"Oh! yes, I must, mamma."&#xD;
'Then kiss me again, darling, and take care of&#xD;
yourself."&#xD;
She walked int6 the cool passage and took a seat on&#xD;
one of the sofas, and, for the first time in my life, T&#xD;
heard her sigh wearily.&#xD;
All that part of the morning I saw little of Paul.&#xD;
When I did meet him he was silent and seemed not to&#xD;
care to speak to me. And indeed I thought it was for&#xD;
the best that we should havc~ no more conversations&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC8273-00000111"/>&#xD;
just then, for, God knows, I could do no good in renew-&#xD;
ing the subject. After luncheon he left the Lodge, and&#xD;
I sat alone iii the library as the evening ~vore on, and&#xD;
watched the heavy clouds as they gathei'cd thick and&#xD;
fast in tl~e west, betokening a storm.&#xD;
I saw Eleanor from time to time looking anxiously&#xD;
at the road that wound around the moorland and then&#xD;
at the gloomy aspect of the sky, and turning to inc&#xD;
once, she asked:&#xD;
"Do you think Gerald has had time to be back,&#xD;
Johfr?"&#xD;
"It depends upon the swiftnes~3 of his steed and the&#xD;
business he was on. But, in any case, he has hard ly&#xD;
had time to be back yet, Eleanor."&#xD;
She gave another glance at the dreary road, and tiir 1-&#xD;
ing away with a sigh quite as heavy as the one she had&#xD;
heaved in the morning, walked to her room.&#xD;
Somewhere between six and seven I went up L~ my&#xD;
own room. Black and lowering clouds were spread&#xD;
over the sky au4 not a ~ Of blue wa3 anywhere to&#xD;
be seen. Ndw and then the distant rumbling of thun-&#xD;
der was heard, seeming to awake the calmness of the&#xD;
sea, which was rapidly becoming troubled, lashing up&#xD;
its foam, as it groaned and heaved beneath *he gather-&#xD;
ing tempest. And as my litth~ repeater rang out the&#xD;
hour of seven it was quite dark in my room.&#xD;

My room was as l)laek ~rs midnight. I suppose the&#xD;

heard Paul come in and soon after enter his own apart-.&#xD;

~was so painful that it made my very l)lOOd curdle. I&#xD;

staggered and fell into a chair near that bloody bier,&#xD;
to watch during the rest of~ the night. There, too, sat&#xD;
the stricken father at his son's head ,gazingin mute&#xD;

I leaned over and put my hand on. the heart to see&#xD;
if there was any sign of life there; but no I no! it was&#xD;
still as the grave which would soon claim it as its own.&#xD;
his watch, portuilonie and diamond ring, and every-&#xD;
thing of value was still on his 1M~~'~fl, showing. that&#xD;
the ~55~55j~~5 hand that had cut him down did not do&#xD;
it for pecuniary motives. The body could not be&#xD;
removed until the coroner's inquest was held; and oh!&#xD;
how those dreary hours dragged on, until the coming&#xD;
dawn, whilst 11 sat stroking from time to time the damp&#xD;
curls from the death-dewed boyish brow, and thinking&#xD;
how little should we set our hearts on anything earthly&#xD;
that must pei~sh and die. Can I ever 'forget that fear-&#xD;
ful night? Al~ ! no, indeed! it 'is indelibly impressed&#xD;
upon my memory, and I seem, even now, to 'hear the&#xD;

upon her child to come back to her, "that he was not&#xD;
dead " "it could not be." " Ah ! no, my beautiful boy,&#xD;
'with all your fair promises of youth, health and strength&#xD;

to your ,mother's heart." ~hc would then relapse into&#xD;
a painful silence only to' be broken l)y fresh bursts of&#xD;
sorrow. Calling upon God to restore her her child,&#xD;
anti telhino'~ Him He was not merciful in taking him&#xD;
from her. "What is all this world to me if I have&#xD;
him not?" Then raising herself on one arm, and&#xD;
looking at me with a face so eorpse4ikc that I shiud-&#xD;
dered, she said:'&#xD;

"II know who did it, and f will avenge you, my&#xD;
murdered love, my poor lost darling. May I never&#xD;
rest iii case either in soul or 1)ody until I see the one&#xD;
who (lid this cruel deed brought to j justice "&#xD;

upon her arm, "you arc wil(l with grief and excite-&#xD;

"Yes, God !" she answered, frantically; "it looks as&#xD;
if He would comfort me who has robbed me of every&#xD;
earthly ~omfort and broken my heart."&#xD;
I felt that consolation here would have as little&#xD;
effect as the soft rains of heaven on the solid rock.&#xD;
Paul tried several times during the remainder of that&#xD;
night and the nuxt day to approach her to oiler sym-&#xD;

did not feel very much surprised, for .1 knew that she&#xD;
had never loved him, and she could not have forgotten&#xD;
yet the animosity that the boys bore t~ each other&#xD;
lately. Lord Gordon had not uttered a word Since&#xD;
his son's murder had been made known to him. This&#xD;
was truly a blow to him, for, like Eleanor, Gerald was&#xD;
his only hope, and he felt all a father's love for the&#xD;
lifeless 'form beside him. The authorities had not* yet&#xD;
arrived. Ii left Eleanor's room to take another look&#xD;
at that face in death, which in hifb had claimed more&#xD;
of ITIJ ~)ity than my love ; and as if gazed upon it so&#xD;
pale itnd cold, from which the soul had fled, II felt the&#xD;

brought to deck it. The whole affair created the most&#xD;
intense excitement, and many came to offer consola-&#xD;

know when the body ~vas to be removed, for the doctor&#xD;
was already uneasy for fear her mind would be injured&#xD;
by this terrible ordJal. So, noiseles~ly and silently we&#xD;
bore it away to its narrow home, and I lingered after&#xD;

continued all tha.t was left of that mother's bright&#xD;

narrow cell, with the sea singing his requiem. After It&#xD;
arose from my knees, I found that another form had&#xD;
been kneeling and that I was not alone, and I felt&#xD;
proud of my boy to see how deeply grieved he was at&#xD;
the untimely end of his young relative and how entirely&#xD;
forgetful of how, if he had lived, he would have crossed&#xD;
his path and marred all his earthly happiness.&#xD;
Eleanor lay iii a perfect stupor for the next day or&#xD;

When I returned to consciousness, there was quite a&#xD;
little crowd collected around me, and my old friend,&#xD;
Dr. Arnold, was rubbing my hand. One or two of the&#xD;
old servants from the Lodge were there, Patrick being&#xD;
one of them, and were sobbing like children, while&#xD;
near the prisoner stood the noble form of Lord Leigh&#xD;
and the light and graceful one of Anthony Gay. They&#xD;
were both sj)eaking to Paul, telling him "that no mat-&#xD;
ter what the verdict said, t hey would believe, as they&#xD;
did now, from tlieh' very hearts; that lie was innocent."&#xD;
Murmurs of discontent were heard in the crowd, which&#xD;
was rapidly increasing' for here was the man who had&#xD;
extended his hand to the poor and had given charity to&#xD;
the widow and the orphan, who had been received into&#xD;
the halls of the noble and great, being one of the&#xD;
brightest ornaments there, and to whom none could&#xD;

~~'as JJaUon. I went to see, and came back an(l told&#xD;
&#xD;
and he went directly to it. I ~ttpp~s~ it was half an&#xD;
hour, or perhaps three-quarters, after that when I went&#xD;
myself to see if he wanted anything. I opened the&#xD;
door softly and saw hun sitting at the window smoking&#xD;
a cigar, looking oat U~Ofl the sky in the direction of his&#xD;
home. II asked him if he had slept any. 'No,' was&#xD;
the moody answer, and then in the same breath, 'Get&#xD;
my horse Ii want to go down to Dalton's.' (Dalton&#xD;
was one of the young men who had visited him that&#xD;
day.) In about ten or fifteen minutes after that I saw&#xD;
him riding at full speed in the direction of his friend's.&#xD;
I don't kno~v exactly how long after this it was before&#xD;
he cime back, but suppose it, was an hour and a half or&#xD;
tw~ hours. His horse was smoldng and foaming with&#xD;
hard riding and he himself seemed to be very much&#xD;
fatigued. lie threw himself upon two chairs in my&#xD;
public room and closed his eyes. I went up to him&#xD;
and asked him if he wouldn't lie down. He answered&#xD;
'no,' and then ordered his supper, telling me to make&#xD;
haste, as he ~Yanted to go home. He closed his eyes&#xD;
again, and I went to haVe supper prepared for him.&#xD;
I' It was now very dark, and the storm had just&#xD;
begun to rage without. When his supper was ready I&#xD;
went in myself to wait upon him. He ate very little&#xD;
and complained, 1l~at the coffee was not good and that&#xD;
the waffles hadn't risen well. I mack no answ~ r, for I&#xD;
saw that he was out of sorts. He stayed a long time&#xD;
at the table alker he had finished, toying with his tea~~&#xD;
spoon. Whenever I spoke to him he answered me in&#xD;
monosyllables or very abruptly. iearirfg some one&#xD;
enter the public room, lie asked me to go and see if it&#xD;
&#xD;
P&#xD;
&#xD;
him 'no.' 'What can 1)0 keeping him?' he said,&#xD;
whilst an angry fro~vn contracted his brow. 'He prom-&#xD;
ised to be here at eight.' 'It is twenty minutes after&#xD;
eight, sir, and I don't suppose he ~vi1l come in such a&#xD;
storm,' I ventured to remark, lie rose from the table&#xD;
then and looked out. The lightningj4~hed in his face&#xD;
as lie opened the door. 'This is enough to wake the&#xD;
dead,' he said, as the flash was followed by a burst of&#xD;
b          ~    'I&#xD;
thunder. Then turning' to me, he~.. want my&#xD;
horse quicldy~' 'Oh! sir,' I pleaded, '(10 not go out&#xD;
in such a tempest. You may he killed by the light-&#xD;
ning.' 'I 'want my horse,' he repeated. I had the'&#xD;
poor animal ordered, and it was somewhat refreshed&#xD;
with its meal of oats a!d short rest. After the horse&#xD;
was brought around, the deceased1 hesitated about going.&#xD;
I suppose he returned twenty tiin~s after starting, some~&#xD;
times to ask one question, then another, and another&#xD;
time made the excuse that he wanted to light his cigar,&#xD;
that the rain had put it out. The last time he came&#xD;
back he asked me to lend him an umbrella, and I went&#xD;
into my wife's room to get one. She was sick at the&#xD;
tinie and ~Iie had to have an opiate every hour. $he&#xD;
reminded me of it as I entered the room, and I[ looked&#xD;
at the clock and saw that the hands pointed to nine. I&#xD;
lingered in the room a few moments after she had taken&#xD;
it, and then wcnt out into the public room. The&#xD;
deceased was sitting at a little side-table, with his head&#xD;
in his hands, lie did not notice my entrance, and I&#xD;
was very quiet, and I know that it must have been at&#xD;
least a quartet of an hour before he roused~himself.&#xD;

lie started uj~ suddenly and asked for the umbrella.&#xD;
The storm was now at its height, and as he opened the&#xD;
(loor the ~aiii da-~hed iii lii torrents flud the thunder&#xD;
rocked the horse l&amp;amp;liC a era(lle. I VQUtIV'ed 011CC more&#xD;
h           to~ beg him no~ to go, but he made no answer, and. in a&#xD;
fc~ moments 1 heard him u:'ging his horse at full&#xD;
speed.&#xD;
" How long (10 you suppose it would have taken liiui&#xD;
* to ride from your house to Gordon Lodge ? " asked tlie*&#xD;
judge.&#xD;
The man replied without any Iwsitid ion&#xD;
"It is measured te~i English miles. The deceased&#xD;
always. rode the finest and most spirited horses. The&#xD;
one he rode this particular evening ~vas to be sure a&#xD;
little 1aded and the condition' of the roads was not&#xD;
good. So, I would say, reckoning all this, it wouki&#xD;
'take him fall two hom~'.~."&#xD;
The next witness called was Michael Daisy, Lady&#xD;
Grantley's gardener. Thir 01(1 man in giving in his&#xD;
~evidence would tell his own story, much to the amuse~&#xD;
mont of some present:&#xD;
"Well," he began. I had gone on the 19th of&#xD;
August to sit at the wake of Andrew Murphy, who had&#xD;
died that morning of fever, at six o'clock, in company&#xD;
with Patrick Donahoe and Timothy Noonan. Poor&#xD;
Andrew-the Lord rest him-lived two miles on the&#xD;
north side of the grove of ft:~s on the moorland. At&#xD;
eleven oAock that iiight I was; sitting at the wake."&#xD;
" Jiow do you know it was eleven o'clock, Michael ?"&#xD;
asked the couusel.&#xD;
Why, the clock told me, your honor, and ~no one&#xD;

0                            )&#xD;
was flasa after flash anti then such a roar as the thun~&#xD;
der would give. But as I ~at there I remembered my&#xD;
Lady bad given me some orders about her flowers,&#xD;
which went out of my bead entirely, and I thouo'ht&#xD;
what a drenching their pretty heads xvo~ild get, fr the&#xD;
rain was coming down a~ if the sea was turned l)ottom&#xD;
upwards, and I feared the big (Irops would take off&#xD;
their dresses altogether if I (li(1 not go to them ; and&#xD;
then I thought ~of my Lady's sad face when she saw&#xD;
that t~hey were spoilt. I asked Patrick I)unahoe tq&#xD;
COl7flC IlOiflO with rue. 'I, faith,' he answered, ' eatah&#xD;

he answereKl, before. I had time to speak, 'it is a horse~&#xD;
and no rider upon him. Ii suppose th~ poor fellow&#xD;
has been struck by the lightning.' 'Faith, it looks bad&#xD;
enough,' said I, 'butt let us go here to the firs and shel-'&#xD;
ter ourselves a while.' So in ! stepped ~nd Tim fbi-&#xD;
lowed me. I had' walked in a few steps, when I stum-&#xD;
bled over something and fell, and felt that it was the&#xD;
form of a man. I called Tim, and he came to me by&#xD;
the sound of my v6i~e,. and I told him to feel and see&#xD;
what it was. lie felt it, and said, ' yes, that it was a&#xD;
'man, that the poor creature must have been killed hy&#xD;
the lightning, and that must have been 'his horse we&#xD;
had just seen.' I' had a match-box in my pocket, so I&#xD;
to6k it out and struck a light. I told Tim to hold his&#xD;
hat up, so the rain would no1t fall upon it. He did so,&#xD;
and I saw by the light of it a man lying with his face&#xD;
downwards~ and, blood running from his head. One of&#xD;
the big firs had been struck by lightning, and I thought&#xD;
the poor fellow had been hit by one of the branches.&#xD;
"We turned hioi over and saw it was the young Lord&#xD;
at the Lodge. One of his hands was grasping his coat&#xD;
near his heart ~ the other had a gash on it right across&#xD;
the fingers, like it had been cut with a knife. I felt&#xD;
my blood run cold as I looked at him, and. it was a ter-&#xD;
rible sight, your Lonor. We ran back to the wake and&#xD;
told the men there, who came with us immediately.&#xD;
We made a rude kind of frame by the light of the Ian-&#xD;
tern we had, and* we lifted the poor thing from the&#xD;
ground and laid him upon it, and carried it home to&#xD;
~his poor mother., And I pray the good Lord that I&#xD;
may never see such a sight again if I live to be as old&#xD;
as Mathusalum.".&#xD;
&#xD;
This was Michael's evidence, and he ~tood all the&#xD;
questions and cross-questions without deviating the&#xD;
least from it. lie was then asked what time he sup-&#xD;
1)OSed it ~va~ when he came to the grove the first time.&#xD;
lie said ho could not tell exactly, but when they went&#xD;
back for help to the wake it was a quarter to one, and&#xD;
that it was two by the big clock at the Lodge when&#xD;
they laid the body in the hall. As I said before, it&#xD;
was impossible to prevent Michael from going on in&#xD;
his own simple way, and as he was a very important&#xD;
witness there was not much objection made.&#xD;
The next witness was Timothy Noonan, and as his&#xD;
evidence coincided with Michael's i~ every particular,&#xD;
I will not give it here.&#xD;
Old Patrick was the next witness called. There&#xD;
were tears in his aged eyes, and his voice often choked&#xD;
w th emotion as he gave the following evidence:&#xD;
"I have been with the Prisoner from his infancy to&#xD;
hi ~ manhood and he was as lovely a boy and as noble&#xD;
a ~an as ever the bright rays of the sun shone upon.&#xD;
II e was a model of honor, truth and moral worth, and&#xD;
wis as gentle and as tender as a woman in dispositionn"&#xD;
(iJe here paused to brush away ~ tear that was trick-&#xD;
ling down his honest face.) lie~~~as then asked if the&#xD;
deceased and the prisoner had been on amicable terms&#xD;
with each other up to the time of the murder.&#xD;
lie answered:&#xD;
"No, he did not 'think they lived upon exactly ami-&#xD;
cable terms, though generally they were very polite&#xD;
and gentlemanly towards each other."&#xD;
lie was then asked what he meant by saying that he&#xD;

old man very reluctantly replied&#xD;
"On the 18th of August."                  2&#xD;
Patrick was then told tq give 'all the particulars of&#xD;
the quarrel, and he did so in the following words&#xD;
"On the evening of the 18th, the prisoner came in&#xD;
some time after the dinner-hour. I3oth the prisoner&#xD;
and the decease~i left the Lodge soon after breakfast&#xD;
that morning, separately. Ii went to the prisoner's&#xD;
room soon after he came and tol&amp;amp; him, that his dinner&#xD;
was ready. He rose silently, and prece~1e~l me to the&#xD;
V.&#xD;
dining-room. Shortly after this, the deceased entere(1,&#xD;
and soon a~er joined the prisoner at the table. I was&#xD;
there when he came in, and noticed that they did not~&#xD;
speak to each other. I remained but a few moments&#xD;
after that in the room-I wa~ called awiiy to attend to'&#xD;
~oinething I had neglected that morning in an adjoin~&#xD;
in~ room. I don't know how long I had been there&#xD;
when I heard very loud voices fi'om the dining-room.&#xD;
I could not tell what the words were that were uttered,&#xD;
V&#xD;
but I went in as speedily as possible, and found that the&#xD;
prisoner hzd arrested the arm of the deceased, in the&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
haiid of which was a loaded pistol. They were both&#xD;
very much excited. I was too frightened to remcm~&#xD;
1)er what was said by either of them, but, shortly after&#xD;
I entered, the prisoner let the deceased's arm go. The&#xD;
(leceased then rushed, at the prisoner with the intention&#xD;
of' strul(ing him, but the 1)10w was parried, and t!:e.&#xD;
prisoner knocked the deceased down and left the room.&#xD;
J did not see. the prisoner ac'aun until the next even-&#xD;
Jug, when he came back between cloven and twelve, or&#xD;
I think it was nearer to twelve, though I do riot&#xD;
exactly remember. i, myself; opened the door for him.&#xD;
lIe was very wet from the rain, and stopped in the&#xD;
passage to hang his hat up."&#xD;
"I)id lie speak to you, or did you notice any agita-&#xD;
tion in his manner?" lie was asked.&#xD;
"Yes "answered the old man, slowly, "but he bade&#xD;
me good night as usual, and lei't the room."&#xD;
lIe was here questioned and cross-questioned a grcat&#xD;
(loal, but lie gave the same answers all the time. lie&#xD;
was then told to go on, an(l lie contiiiue(l&#xD;
"I soon after went to~?rnv own room to prepare for&#xD;
bej. I don't know hio~v long I slept, when I was&#xD;
wakened by the l)orter, who rapped very loudly at the&#xD;
door, telling me to rise quickly. I put on my clothes&#xD;
as quickly as possible, and opened the door for him.&#xD;
/ lie was as white as a magnolia leaf; and trembled like&#xD;
cii aspen. 'Something dreadful has happened,' he&#xD;
said, 'our young.Lord has been murdered.' I trem-&#xD;
bled now in my turn, and enquired tbr the Iarticmmlai'~.&#xD;
lie said he could not o'ive them to me, ft~r all that he&#xD;

Prisoner s room. II~ sc~iued violently agitated, and&#xD;
exchunwd 'Mv heavens 1' when he heard the dreadful&#xD;
tidings I brought. During the rest of the night the&#xD;
prisoner seemed very much grieved, mid ,twice I saw&#xD;
hun shed tears, and lie remained near the bier the&#xD;
whole night, and no inducement would 1)erSU~dC him&#xD;
to leave it. Even at the grave lie hingercd longest,&#xD;
and h~d a look of real pam in his face."&#xD;
lie was here cross1uestioned again, ~nd this finished&#xD;
his evidence.&#xD;
The next called up was Manning, the head dining-&#xD;
room servant at the Lodge, whQ was present during&#xD;
the quarrel between'the two young mcii.&#xD;
It is unnecessary to give aft of his~evidence, so I&#xD;
will only give the part that related to the quarrel, as&#xD;
the rest of it ~o1neided with Patrick's.&#xD;
He becran:&#xD;
"On the evening of the 18th of August, I was in&#xD;
the dining-room when~ the prisoner caine in. He sat&#xD;
down at the table in science, and I suppose had been&#xD;
there tQn or fifteen minutes when the deceased entered.&#xD;
lie, also; took his place a&amp;amp; the table in' silence, and&#xD;
only staid there a few minutes and did not eat much.&#xD;
As he rose to leave, he drew his handkerchief from his&#xD;
pocket7 and, in doing so, a note dropped from his pocket&#xD;
&#xD;
ii&#xD;
&#xD;
to the floor, very near tl~e prisoner, who picked it up&#xD;
and said Th was his own. 'ft is not yours,' said tho&#xD;
deceased, coming up to him. 'I say i~t is,' answeredd&#xD;
the prisoner, 'and I wish to know how it came into&#xD;
your possession?' I do not remember the deceased's&#xD;
answer, and there was a great deal more passed between&#xD;
them that I do not remember. At length the deceased&#xD;
went to snatch the note from the prisoner's hand, who&#xD;
raised his arm to strike him. The deceased then drew&#xD;
a revolver, but the prisoner arrested it before lie had&#xD;
time to fire."&#xD;
The rest of the evidence the4 reader is acquainted&#xD;
with, and it is too painful for me to repeat it here.&#xD;
This witness expatiated largely on the merits of poor&#xD;
Gerald; for Some reason of his own, making his&#xD;
evidence as hard on the prisoner as possible. I saw&#xD;
Lord Leigh frown angrily several times whilst he was&#xD;
speaking, and heard Anthony Gay, who was also near&#xD;
me, call him repeatedly a villain.&#xD;
Thelast witness was Godfrey Laugh ton.&#xD;
lie apl)roached the ~witness stand with the same ease&#xD;
and grace that always characterized him, and in his&#xD;
high4oned, cultivated voice gave in his evidence thus:&#xD;
"I have kno~~n the prisoner about two years, but i[&#xD;
cannot say that I have known him intimately. He&#xD;
was generally cold and stiff' in his demeanor towards&#xD;
me, though always gentlemanly. I think, from my&#xD;
own personal knowledge of him and the deceased, that&#xD;
they were not on good terms. I overheard a conver-&#xD;
sat ion, on the the evening of the 10th of Aixgust, at&#xD;
Lady Grantly's, which convinced inc of this fact. I&#xD;

was in Lady Grantlv~s harp-room, in one of the win-&#xD;
dows smoking, when ti1L~ prisoner ana a lady entered.&#xD;
I paid little at tention to what they were saying until&#xD;
I heard the prisoner exclaim : ' If Gerald Gordon&#xD;
insists upon marrying Miss Waviand it will cost lilni&#xD;
his life ! ' Almost immediately alter this they left the&#xD;
room)&#xD;
Laughton was here asked if he did not see t'he lady,&#xD;
too. He answered positively, "Ao,~ that he was seated&#xD;
so that he could only'see tho gentleman ; "nor could I&#xD;
have recognized the tones of her voice, for they were&#xD;
vet~v low and s&amp;amp;t."&#xD;
(I had also noticed on that eventful night how&#xD;
softly and sweetly Amy spoke in the harp-room, and&#xD;
I could not help but a(lmire and feel grateful to&#xD;
Laughton for his dehcacv in thus preventing hei~ being&#xD;
brought before the eourL)&#xD;
The witness continued&#xD;
"I did not see the prisoner after that until the 19th&#xD;
day of Auaiiist. One of mv tenants had died that&#xD;
morning, and I went down' to s~e if Ii could~ do any-&#xD;
thing for his distressed family. On. my return, as~ I&#xD;
approached the grove of firs on the moorland, I was&#xD;
somewhat surprised at seeing the prisoner emerge from&#xD;
the2rn. He scarcely recognized me, seemed very much&#xD;
agitated, and walked away as rapidly as possible. I&#xD;
saw him again that night, somewhere about eleven. I&#xD;
had gone to Andrew Drew's, an old friend of mine,&#xD;
who lives at Mount Fair, some timq before the storm&#xD;
eommeneefi. The time was very pleasantly spent, and&#xD;
it was iiear ten ~'eloek when I arose to return home.&#xD;
&#xD;
IMy friend begged inc to remain with him, as it was&#xD;
raining very heavily. I told him an old soldier did&#xD;
not flhill(l tli~ rail). ~l'I he ijisisted Upon accom-&#xD;
panying ute, and all I coul(l say or (10 woul4 not dis-&#xD;
suade him from going part of the way. The hard rain&#xD;
J)reVeute(.I 115 from making rapi(i progress,~ and the&#xD;
lightning was ViVi(I arid ('Oflt'11110115. wlen we had&#xD;
gottemi within about a quarter of a mile of the firs, I&#xD;
~saw, by a brilliant flash of the lightning, a man st'and-&#xD;
ing under one of the trees, not far from the grove.&#xD;
My companion als saw him, and we 1)0th thought it&#xD;
btralge that lie shoul I be there during such a violent&#xD;
storm. As we came up to him, I sai(l, 'Friend, what&#xD;
are you doing here during such a fearful storm? If&#xD;
you have no way of' going 'home, ,jnmp up here behind&#xD;
me and I wPl take you.'&#xD;
"'Thank you, but don't mind me,' was the brief&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"Wheit lie spoke, I exclaimed, in astonishment:&#xD;
'Wh~y, Paul, are you here?' for I instantly recognized&#xD;
hie voice. ~fIe said nothing, but another vivid flash&#xD;
sbo~ved him to me as plainly as I ever saw him ifi my&#xD;
life. 'You'll be drowned,' I co~tinuecl, 'if you stay&#xD;
out here much longer: you had better come with me.'&#xD;
'No, no; the roads are too heavy for any animal to&#xD;
carry two, and, besides, I can shorten the distance by&#xD;
~~i.ng through the fields,' he answere(I. Andrew Drew&#xD;
then offered him hisT horse, as he had much further&#xD;
to waIk~han himself. This offer lie also refused, tell-~&#xD;
ing Andu~ew~. that lie was very kind and extending his&#xD;
hand to him. He then begged us to go on ax4d not to&#xD;

tarry in the rain on his account, an~l that he would&#xD;
soon be at home himself'. ILbere insisted upon Andrew 's&#xD;
returning home, and I took my way to Merry hail,&#xD;
caving the prisoner where we had found him.~~&#xD;
Andrew grew's evidence was the same as this given&#xD;
here, and his ended the examination of' witnesses. I&#xD;
don't know how to describe my feelings whilst th9&#xD;
jury ~vas forming the verdict. I must have been sus-&#xD;
tained by excitement, for I was wild with apprehen-&#xD;
sign. At last the jury entered, and to the question-&#xD;
"Guilty or Not Guilty?" "Guilty!" ~yas the answer,&#xD;
and for a while I lost consciousness. -As I returned&#xD;
to my senses, the awful sentence of death by hanging&#xD;
was being pronounced upon the prisoner.&#xD;
And was this all my glory and all my pride-the&#xD;
looming gibbet? Indeed, I was truly an old man now.&#xD;
Au! never, never wOuld I look upon this world again&#xD;
with its joys and its casures, for my heart wag in the&#xD;
lonely cell with the lo ely prisoner, and would follow&#xD;
liini wherever he went, en to the grave.&#xD;
I asked Lord Leigh what my poor boy said ~vhen&#xD;
asked whSr the sentence of death should not be pro-&#xD;
nounced against him. He answered thQat his appeal&#xD;
was short, simple and touching, and that he had taken&#xD;
it down in his note book, and~handed it to me. II will&#xD;
insert it here:&#xD;
"My friends, if such you will permit me to call you&#xD;
after having heard me, like Cain, branded as a mur-&#xD;
(lerer, I protest here, in the presence of my Divine&#xD;
Maker, that I am innocent of' so dreadful ~ crime.&#xD;
Many ~f you weep for me, and your tears fall, as the&#xD;
&#xD;
* gentle i'ains from heaven, soothing and refreshing, upon&#xD;
a withered plant which has been blight&amp;amp;l by a rude&#xD;
blast. Gerald Gordon was nofmy enemy, and I never.&#xD;
sle~v him. So, far was I from murdering him, that I&#xD;
would no~ most willingly give my life to see hiyi. back&#xD;
in his mother's arms. - I stand, as it were, a lone in this&#xD;
great world. Few would mourn for me were I in his&#xD;
l)ia~. Perhaps a tear from some kind friend might fall&#xD;
in tribute to my memory, but when that dried all remem~&#xD;
branches would float away as the sea ~vinding~ on to the&#xD;
distant ocean. But for him, whom the reaper spared&#xD;
not in his spring time, but cut away, as the harvester&#xD;
does his golden grain, unmindful of the flowers, there&#xD;
weeps a grief-stricken mother, who rafts her heaving&#xD;
sighs to the 'sepulchre by the s&amp;amp;a,' where, clasped in&#xD;
the arms of the still visitor, sleeps he~ first and only&#xD;
born, his fair hair cov&amp;amp;~d over by the death dews.&#xD;
Her\ heart has been a fearful wreck since his young&#xD;
life blood ebbed and flowed and sprinkled the green&#xD;
turf beneath the dark grove on the inoorland. There&#xD;
is a father, too, who has grown oki since the eyes of his&#xD;
darling were closed forever, and lie mourns for the day&#xD;
that will never return, when he heard those lips, now&#xD;
cold and bloodless and hushed in death, calling his&#xD;
name. Ah! again I sa~r that i[ would give my life to&#xD;
redeem his. O1~! my friends, this is a sad ordeal.&#xD;
There was, truly, a sorro~v that was robbing my life of&#xD;
its brightness and youth, and the form that rendered&#xD;
its soul to its Maker 1~here," pointing to the dark grove,&#xD;
"was accessory to that grief'. But believe me, my&#xD;

&#xD;
HIE night was cold and raw, and the driz-&#xD;
zling rm came down slow and penetrating,&#xD;
Causing the unlucky ones who were exposed&#xD;
t-o it to shake and shiver. It fell noise-&#xD;
lessly upon the roofs of the houses in the great city&#xD;
of London. My own heart was as cheerless as this&#xD;
direary night as I rang the bell at theldoor of my old&#xD;
friend the duke whom I introduced to you at Gordon&#xD;
Lodge in the'summer of 13-, when Paul was b)ut a&#xD;
little boy. 1 had met him frequently since and had&#xD;
long' numiber~ed him among my warmest and most inti-&#xD;
mate friends. Nor had he forgotten the child whose&#xD;
curly head he had stroked, on that summer's evening&#xD;
many years ago, and who had won his way to the&#xD;
old man's. heart and was still tenderly cherished&#xD;
there. My summons was answered by a grey-headed&#xD;
butler, who ushered me into a warm, comfortable&#xD;
drawing-room, where brilliant lights formed a strange&#xD;
contrast to the gloom without and to the dreariness&#xD;
of my weary, worn heart. I had not long to wait&#xD;
when the door opened and the old duke entered, lie&#xD;
grasped my hand warmly without speaking, and we&#xD;
seated ourselves. in silence. After a pause of a few&#xD;
moments he spoke to me, saying:&#xD;
" This is a said meeting truly, my dear friend. You&#xD;
lhave had my deepest sympathy throughou tthe whole&#xD;
of this sad affair, and I 'im the more dee ly grieved&#xD;

"Then you really believe t1i~it he is innocent after&#xD;
the convincing evidence you have heard?"&#xD;
"I do, indeed," was the honest answer of this noble&#xD;
cv~entleman.&#xD;
fl&#xD;
"Oh ! I think God there is one who believes with&#xD;
me.&#xD;
"Not only one, but the numbers are multiplied, who&#xD;
believe him guiltless."'&#xD;
"Ali ! "I sighed, "when I thi~ik of him in his lonely&#xD;
prison, with no comforting voice; no kind word, to&#xD;
lighten his heavy heart, it is hard, hard to bea~x"&#xD;
"Do not your suspiCionS rest upon any one?" asked&#xD;

"Then we must kave a reprieve to, give us time to&#xD;

"That is my business here now, and, niy dear friend,&#xD;
I beg that ypu will render me your valuable assistance."&#xD;
"With all my heart! with all my heart!" was the&#xD;
Jiind reply. "I feel that I cannot do too much for this&#xD;
young friend of mine, and I am entirely at, your ser~&#xD;
vice. The sentence is to be put into execution on the&#xD;
2&amp;amp;th of November, isn't it?"&#xD;
"Ani this is-"&#xD;
"The first of October," I answered.&#xD;
"I will use all my influence, Mr. Meredith, to get&#xD;
you a reprieve, and ~ne for as long a period as pos~&#xD;

"Oh! yes, yes," I cric(l, "for as long a period as&#xD;

"I noticed. that the gentleman speaking in the coun~&#xD;
sel for the defence was very eloquent. This young&#xD;
Lord Leigh has quite distinguished himself and seems&#xD;
to have spoken from a heart teeming with the highest&#xD;

lie here al)ruptly asked:&#xD;
"Arc you personally acquainted with this Godfrey&#xD;

"Yes~ I have known him for some time."&#xD;
"Sufficiently to have formed an estimate of his&#xD;
character?"&#xD;
"No," hesitatingly, "l)tit I don't think I am very&#xD;
mitch 1repossesscd in his favor."&#xD;
The duke looked into 4he fire musino'I&#xD;
moments, but did not pursue the subject, and shortly&#xD;
afterwards I arose to take my departure. The kind&#xD;
ge atleman insisted upon my remaining and partaking&#xD;
of his hospitality. I thanked hi~n warmly, but said&#xD;
'%hat I must go back to my hotel, where rooms were&#xD;
pt'epared for me2 I then bade him good night and&#xD;
walked out, feehin~ easier in mind than I had yet done&#xD;
in those weary days of anxiety and care.&#xD;
As I entered the public room of the hotel my atteti~&#xD;

by one of a group of j~'oung men, who were sitting&#xD;
somewhat apart from the crowd smoking. lie was&#xD;

is enough to condemn St. Peter were he placed in a&#xD;
similar position."&#xD;
"I am sure of his innocence, too,'~ added a second,&#xD;
taking a cigar from his mouth and puffing the smoke&#xD;
into the air. " I knew SteWart at college, and he was&#xD;
the finest fellow there; but that Gordon, ~ fellow,&#xD;
was as weak as a girl. I f~e1 sorry for him noW that&#xD;
he is dead and gone, but I never liked him much while&#xD;

"Well, here," sai(1 1 t1iir(~, "is a health, to Stewart,&#xD;

.1 here went to my room, thinking of the old duke's&#xD;
remark "The numbers are multiplied who believe in&#xD;
his innocence," and I lay down much comforted in&#xD;
mind and slept until morning.&#xD;
I staid but as short a time as II possibly could in&#xD;
London, but did not leave until the reprieve was&#xD;
granted and signed with the royal seal. It then turned&#xD;
my face homeward with the duke as my companion,&#xD;
thanking God in my inmost soul for His goodness in&#xD;
thus granting mc a longer time to think and to act.&#xD;
The locomotive whistled. loud and clear on the still&#xD;
autumn air as we took our seats for the town of 13-~---.&#xD;

"No~ no, I am not tired, and am most anxious to&#xD;

"To the prison, driver," he called, without waiting&#xD;
for me to give the order.&#xD;
I sat back in the carriage with my heart overflowing&#xD;
with gratitude to this good-old man, who seemed never&#xD;
to weary in doing good. When we reached the pris.-&#xD;
oner's cell, we found Paul sitting by a small deal table,&#xD;
on which burned a solitary lamp. lie was reading&#xD;
with his elbow resting on the table. The noise of our&#xD;
entrance roused him, and he came forward with both&#xD;
hands extended. I took him in my arms and pressed&#xD;
him to my heart, and noticed a smile of gratitude light&#xD;
up his face. And when the duke caught him by both&#xD;
hands and wrung them warmly, tears filled his eyes.&#xD;
"My son," lie said, "I pledge to you my belief in&#xD;
your perfect innocence, and Ii have come here with the&#xD;
express purpose of seeing you and telling you this."&#xD;
"Alit sir, you have performed an act worthy of the&#xD;

After a few moments the duke spoke:&#xD;

LIE days were fast rolling on, and still no&#xD;
chic to the murderer. I went one even-&#xD;
~ lag to Geraldine's. I entered the quiet&#xD;
ittic hail and rapp  gently at her cham~&#xD;
ber door. Amy opened it for me; whispering&#xD;
"speak softly," and instead of inviting mc in, came&#xD;
out into the passage and closed the door noiselessly&#xD;
behind her. We then walked to the little green par~&#xD;
br, and sitting on the sofa beside me, she to! dmethat&#xD;
her mother had been very sick ever since the day that&#xD;
Paul had 1)ecn convicted.&#xD;
"Dr. Arnold has told me not to be too confident ~f&#xD;
her recovery, and to keep her very qui~t. And this&#xD;
morning papa came to me with a proposal of marriage&#xD;
from Godfrey Laughton, which, of course, I refused.&#xD;
This enraged papa, but I was firm and determined.&#xD;
Papa then said that I should obey him."&#xD;
"II marry Godfrey Laughton!" she continued, with&#xD;
the old fire flashing in her eyes. "Never! never! and&#xD;
I told papa so."&#xD;
The excitement soon ended and the soft loo~ came&#xD;
back into her face as she told me "that it all resulted&#xD;
in m~Udng her poor mother much worse."&#xD;
After I l~ad delivered Paul's message, she asked me'&#xD;
"II' she could not ~o sometimes to see him?" iI~ told&#xD;
her "yes; that I would consider it, and perhaps obtain&#xD;
her permission to do so,"&#xD;

Do, do," she said, "for I must see hint But there&#xD;
is Godfrey Laughton," she broke off suddenly, "What&#xD;
must I do with him? Oh! don't leave me, uncle,"&#xD;
catching me by the sleeve and holding me besid~ her&#xD;
on the sofa.&#xD;
He entered in the same bland manner that was usual&#xD;
with hiip~, offering each of us his hand in turn. As II&#xD;
did not give way to him, he made his visit very short.&#xD;
When he was about leaving, he asl~e~~ Amy if he might&#xD;
call the following evening and see her alone?&#xD;
"Mr. J~augliton," she answered, coldly, "there is no&#xD;
time I can call my own since my mother's illness. My&#xD;
mornings and my evenings arc employed in attendar cc&#xD;
on her."&#xD;
"I am sorry to hear this, but ye~ do not despair ~if&#xD;
seeing you," and, bowing gracefully, lie left us.&#xD;
We did not speak after he was gone,. but watched&#xD;
his i~etreating figure.&#xD;
"My mistress wishes to see Mr. Meredith," said old&#xD;
Nellie, putting her head in at the door.&#xD;
"Go and comfort her, and try to make her troubled&#xD;
mind easier," whispered Amy at her mother's room,&#xD;
whilst she passed out into thd autumn sunshine to&#xD;
refresh her drooping spirits.&#xD;
Geraldine held out her wasted hand to me as&#xD;
entered her chamber.&#xD;
"I am so glad you have come, John. I have wanted&#xD;
to see you fur a long time."&#xD;
I sat down 1)y her bedside and looked upon that&#xD;
gentle face of which 31 was so {bnd. Tho blue veins&#xD;
were distinct and clear now upon the white forehead,&#xD;
&#xD;
251&#xD;
&#xD;
there were large circles under the pale blue eyes, and&#xD;
bright feverish spots burned upon each cheek. I passed&#xD;
~ my hand over the smooth, warm forehead, and asked&#xD;
if she felt better,&#xD;
"No, I will never feel better again here, John, and&#xD;
the next autumn leaves will fall upon my narrow be ,&#xD;
for I will not linger much longer in this valley of' tears.&#xD;
You have been a kind, good friend to me, and my hap-&#xD;
piness for m~ny years has proceeded from your friend-&#xD;
ship. Ii will leave this world with but little regret,&#xD;
my only one being that my poor child will be left&#xD;
behind, and I would wish to live to see Paul's inno-&#xD;
cence declared, for I know it must be some day, and&#xD;
you will live to see it. There is otfe thing, John, I&#xD;
want to beg you to promise me, and it is after I am&#xD;
gone, not to let my poor Amy marry Godfrey Laugh..&#xD;
ton. Will you stand by he5 and shelter and protect&#xD;
her?" She leaned upon her elbow and looked steadily&#xD;
into my eyes.&#xD;
"I will," I answcre(l firmly.&#xD;
"Then God be blessed! for now I will die happily."&#xD;
here were two children bequeathed to me by their&#xD;
dying ni6t~ers, and I felt that my responsibility was&#xD;
growing heavy and heavier as I sat still gazing upon&#xD;
that gentle face, with its closed eyes and sharp, marked&#xD;
outlines, and knew that a martyr's crown would soon&#xD;
rest upon those soft tresses in a better land.&#xD;
In the evening when I left her I walked down&#xD;
towards the sea. When I came within a short dis-&#xD;

the ground very near it,' almost' in it, evidently in&#xD;
search of something. He saw me coming, and walked&#xD;
rapidly away, but~ I was not mistaken in that graceful&#xD;
carriage, and wondered what Godfrey Laughton was&#xD;
looking for there.&#xD;
&#xD;
'~ EVI~N months had passed in quick suc-&#xD;
cession, carrying with them the autumn&#xD;
~\~JJ frosts and the winter snows; and,~J&#xD;
L~J stood on the piazza at Gordon, a great bee&#xD;
huzzed by me, giving the cheery announcement that&#xD;
spring had come; while out on the lawx~, swarms of&#xD;
small flies were commencing to take wing and light&#xD;
upon the nearest bud or flower. The jonquills, hya-&#xD;
cinths, violets, and Easter flowers were all in bloom,&#xD;
and scenting the air with their fragrant breath; the&#xD;
lawn looked like a smooth green carpet, ornamented&#xD;
here and there by a glistening dew-drop, the birds&#xD;
were twittering and caroling, and all nature seemed&#xD;
alive with joy.&#xD;
Eleanor and Lord Gordon had not been at the&#xD;
Lodge for many months. When Eleanor was able to&#xD;
travel, they had taken her away to Italian skies, to&#xD;
bring the roses back to her cheeks; they had not yet&#xD;
returned, and in all probability would not during the&#xD;
summer. There was still no clue to the murderer, and&#xD;
the reprieve would expire in June. The Duke had&#xD;
written to iIIC that he thought he could have it extended&#xD;
if' necessary, but still I was very miserable, thinking&#xD;
of poor Paul wasting his young life away in a gloomy&#xD;
Prison. The air was so balmy and 'soft this spring'&#xD;
morning, that I took my chair out on the balcony. I&#xD;
had not been there very long, when I saw Geraldine's&#xD;

7\1~T~ hastened ~~th all ~0~~jble speed to the cottage,&#xD;
and as IF went into the 5ick room, 111 saw that ~a great&#xD;
change had taken place in the invalid. 111cr face had&#xD;
sunken,, and the dews of' death were fast gathering on&#xD;
her brow. She recognized me as I. walked to her bed,&#xD;
and a faint smile played 'o\.~cr her features for an&#xD;
instant. Amy waS holding i~er hand in hers, counting&#xD;
the feeble, flickering pulse, and in every lineaflielit of'&#xD;
her young face was depicted despair. I leaned over&#xD;
the dying mother, and heard her praying softly,&#xD;
'invoking blessings upon her child, with whose name&#xD;
she coupled mine and Paul's. She would then make&#xD;
God to&#xD;
an appeal for her erring husband, calling upon&#xD;
be merciful to him, and bring him to Himself, and&#xD;
then relapse into asking ~lessings for Amy.&#xD;
I lifted the disengaged hand which lay upon the&#xD;
coverlid, and felt that the pulse was growing fainter&#xD;
and sloWer, and rapidly ebbing away. I could hardly&#xD;
feel sorry that she was going, for her life had been so&#xD;
full of anguish and of care, and TiOW her spirit 'would&#xD;
soon be peaceful and at rest by her Illeavelily Father's&#xD;
side; but for Amy, my heart bled, as she' 'sat notion&#xD;
less, n~t daring to speak for fear she would snap the&#xD;
cord- that bound her loved mother to earth. Geraldine&#xD;
spoke:&#xD;
&#xD;
1~&#xD;
&#xD;
"Amy, my darling, are you near me?"&#xD;
Yes, in other, (10 ~OU want anything'?"&#xD;
"Nothing, dearest, only to die in your arms."&#xD;
~ placed her head upon the breast of her daughter,&#xD;
Who lovingly twined her arms aroun(l her. I don't&#xD;
know w1)ere Captain Wayland was; 01(1 Nellie had&#xD;
sought for him, but he. could not be found. I was&#xD;
very anxious that he should come in time, hoping that&#xD;
when he saw his gentlewife leaving him forever, that&#xD;
his hard heart might be touched at last. I knew that&#xD;
11 would miss very much her soft smiles, her endur-&#xD;
ing, patient look, and her poor, pale face, and I sighed&#xD;
to think what a blank she would leave in my life.&#xD;
?Uhe (lay passed on, but we did not relinquish our&#xD;
seats ; everything was Still and quiet in that death-&#xD;

the open windows, whilst n&amp;amp;tes from the forest warb-&#xD;
hers struck upon our ears in sweet and musical tones.&#xD;
And the little clock orr the mantle ticked away its&#xD;
aceonds, its minutes, and its hours. Slower and slower&#xD;
beat that heart which was bowed down with its weight&#xD;
of care, fainter afl(l fainter throbbed the pulse, and&#xD;
shorter a'nd shorter grew the breath, and with a smile&#xD;
that was sweet anti heavenly,, the spirit took its flight.&#xD;
II removed her from the arms of her child, and closed&#xD;
the blue eyes, clasped thQ . '!endcr fingers over the&#xD;

of her truest and best friend, who would soon be con~&#xD;
signed to the lap of earth. I rubbed Amy's temples&#xD;
with cologne water, as she lay pale and~ 5tiIl. I then&#xD;
left her and walked front room to room in that little&#xD;
cottage, where IL had seen the poor mother's patient&#xD;
fade, and heard her kind Voice so often in the last&#xD;
twelve years. We buried her the following evening&#xD;
in the quiet graveyard on a little knoll that looked&#xD;
~\~Tards the sea.&#xD;
The southern sun kissed the green mound as it rQ$e&#xD;
from the calm waters, and the gentle dews sprinkled&#xD;
the turf; and called into life the violets and' the roses.&#xD;
Not long after, a little white tombstone rose in that&#xD;
churchyard, simply bearing her name, and around&#xD;
which the myrtle and the ivy twined caressingly.&#xD;
"Re qu~icscat im pace," II murmured, as I cast a fond&#xD;
look at her last resting-place, and left the spot.&#xD;

FELT lonely enough at Gordon Lodge by&#xD;
myself; old Patrick being my only compan-&#xD;
ion, and now that poor Geraldine was no&#xD;
more, there was little for me to think about&#xD;
but my trials, and how to prove Paufs innocence. Amy&#xD;
was more resigned, and her father much kinder, not&#xD;
urging her any more to her marriage with Godfrey,&#xD;
nor had he mentioned it since his wThe's death.&#xD;
I was feeling so lonely and wretched one evening&#xD;
that I determined to walk back to the cottage, though I&#xD;
had been there in* the morning. It was rather late&#xD;
when I left the Lodge, and the moon was peeping up&#xD;
from the sea as I neared the cottage. Xs I opened the&#xD;
white gate and entered, Amy'~ sweet voice fell upon&#xD;
my ear, singing a ballad from Longfellow; she had&#xD;
reach LA the second verse, and I heard:&#xD;
"My life is cold, and dark, and dreary,&#xD;
It rains, and the wind is never weary,&#xD;
My thoughts still clii~g to the mouldering past,&#xD;
And the hopes of my youth fall thick in the bla:t,&#xD;
Eor the day is dark and dreary."&#xD;
"Ab! you remember the last verse,"' I said, entering,&#xD;
and speaking in a cheerful voice.&#xD;
"Yes, yes," a little wearily. "i remember it, but&#xD;
I never ~j~o' ~&#xD;
"Come, now, my child, try to bear ft all patiently,&#xD;
and be cheerful."&#xD;
"Oh ! nude, I try to, but every day my troubles&#xD;

She then told me that Godfrey Laughton had been&#xD;
there that day, and had said that he would marry her,&#xD;
and that very shortly.&#xD;
"I told him," said the brave girl, "that I would.&#xD;
die first. He laughed derisively, saying: 'People&#xD;
didn't die so easily unless they were killed.' And&#xD;
he ~vent on and said he had gone all lengths t~&#xD;

speaking low and mysteriously, "I could lay my finger&#xD;

"Amy, my poor child, you are so cxcjted that you&#xD;

She got up, without speaking, and we entered the&#xD;
sitting-room together. I did not wish to return to the&#xD;
subject again, so I took my chair near The marble&#xD;
centre table, and* commenced turning 'over some pic~&#xD;
tures which lay upon it. As I came near the last Ii&#xD;
found a little oil painting, which I picked up and&#xD;
examined closely. I found it to b~ one of Amy's&#xD;
taken in the costume of' the Greek girl.&#xD;
"I didn't know you had this, Amy; when was it&#xD;
taken?"&#xD;
"Shortly after I made the~ dress for Lady Lillian's&#xD;

paint two of these."&#xD;
"Where is the other one ? ~'&#xD;

HE second reprieve had been obtained,&#xD;
but still we had not-. advanced a step&#xD;
in clearing Paul, and few 1J)ere were&#xD;
now who believed with me in his inno-&#xD;
cence. I was growing rapidly weary of 1ife~ and each&#xD;
day more aI)d more despairing. When I saw the fill&#xD;
frosts carry away the last flowers, and the blasts of&#xD;
November came rushing in, chilling and killing all&#xD;
that Was left of the beautiful summer, there was a&#xD;
(Ireary void inmy heart which made me feel as if all&#xD;
were in vain. I rose one morning from the breakfast&#xD;
table, where I only. went from habit, when one of the&#xD;
servants came in telling me that one of the tenants'&#xD;
~vives was sick, and wishedAo see me.&#xD;
I asked which one it was.&#xD;
"Mrs. Carr, sir," he ansxverc~.&#xD;
This Mrs. Carr lived half a mile from the dark&#xD;
grove on the upper end of the moorland.&#xD;
I wrapped my cloak around me, and drew on my&#xD;
gloves, for it was bitter cold, and went forth. When&#xD;
I had crossed the park, and got out into the highway,&#xD;
I heard a voice calling me, and turning, sa~ Amy.&#xD;
"Wait for me, uncle~ I imagine we ar~ ~both going&#xD;
in the same direction, and it will be so much i~icer to&#xD;
have you than to be alone."&#xD;

with a brilliant carmine4&#xD;

"You are going to Mrs. Carr's, ain't you, uncle? I&#xD;
went~ to see her yesterday and found her very ill. I'm&#xD;
afraid she won't live."&#xD;
Has Lady Eleanor returned yet?" she asked, after&#xD;
we had walked some distance.&#xD;
"No; no; not yet."&#xD;
"You hear from them occasionally, don't you,&#xD;
"Yes, through Lord Gordon, though his hearth too&#xD;
is very delicate. His last letter with ~regard to poor&#xD;
Eleanor was not vgry cheering, lie' said her spirits&#xD;
were still very low and melancholy and nothing seemed&#xD;
to revive her."&#xD;
We had now reached the tenant's (loor, ~vliich was&#xD;
opened by a chubby boy with red cheeks, red hair, and&#xD;
red hands. And to Amy's inquiry "How Was his&#xD;
mother?" said, "He~ didn't know how his mother was;&#xD;
to ask her."&#xD;
We went ~to the sick woman's bedside and found her&#xD;
in a very restless slumber. She presently opeiwd her&#xD;
eyes and recognized us.&#xD;
"Oh! is it you, Mr. Meredith and Miss Amy?"&#xD;
she asked, and her eyes closed again from sheer&#xD;
exhaustion.&#xD;
We raised her head and poured a stimulant into her&#xD;
mouth, which sli~~al1owed with difficulty. She then&#xD;
turned her face~ to m'~ and said, in a weak voice:&#xD;
"Mr. Meredith, it may be, of some use to you: God~&#xD;
frey Laughton passed my house at twelve o'clock at&#xD;
night onTh 19th of August, 18-."&#xD;
"In what direction?~~ I asked, l)reathless]y; but she&#xD;
ti~irned her face to the wall and nevei4 spoke again.&#xD;

OR~ RETRIBUTION.&#xD;
&#xD;
261&#xD;
&#xD;
I was stupified. Why had this woman sent for me&#xD;
to give me with her dying breath a piece of information&#xD;
which might turn the whole tide of affairs and bring&#xD;
my boy back into my arms once more? Perhaps this&#xD;
was the only evidence we could get, but now she was&#xD;
no more, and there was no one left to speak in the cap-&#xD;
tive's cause.&#xD;
"Was there no other grown person about the house&#xD;
on tliat~i ght?" I enquired.&#xD;
"No, there was no other there, the husband being&#xD;
absent."&#xD;
Then all was as blank as ever, and when the neigh-&#xD;
bors came in to perform their duty to the dead, we&#xD;
arose and took our departure.&#xD;
The sun was making a faint effort to shine as we&#xD;
passed out, but, the glare was sickly and dim. 'We&#xD;
walked on for some time in ~ilence, occupied with our&#xD;
own thoughts. The dark grove was but a short dis-&#xD;
tance in front of us no~v, casting its black shadows&#xD;
around, and looking gloomier than ever. One pale ray&#xD;
of the November sun was peeping through the opening&#xD;
the lightning had made on that dreadful night in&#xD;
August. It was an ill-shaped spot the ray formed,&#xD;
but it was bright and shining in contrast to the dark-&#xD;
ness of the rest of the scene. We both stood gazing&#xD;
on this particular place, where the body of the dead&#xD;
boy had laid. There was no mark left of that tragedy.&#xD;
The ground had long since drunk up the crimson blood&#xD;
which had watered the grass, and nothing now re-&#xD;
mained. Amy walked a few steps in front of me, and&#xD;
to my surprise entered the grove. She stooped down,&#xD;

and, on the place where the sunbeam played, picked up&#xD;
something.&#xD;
"What is it, Amy?" IL asked, hurriedly, but she&#xD;
walked rapidly on, as if to pass the dreary spot before&#xD;
answering me. She then turned and held towards me&#xD;
a small piece of jewelry, saying:&#xD;
"Did ~Paui ever have anything like this?"&#xD;
It was a small watch-trinket in the shape of a gaiter,&#xD;
with nine buttons composed of very fine brilliant. I&#xD;
examined it very closely, and did not recognize it. I&#xD;
felt sure that I had never seen i~ before. In answer to&#xD;
her inquiry, I said:&#xD;
"Give' it to ~ne, child, and say nothing about it, ~r&#xD;
I must find out whom it belongs to."&#xD;
We walked on then, both dreading to say anythix g,&#xD;
and fearing to hope. I knew by the tarnish on the&#xD;
little jewel that it must liav~ been out some time. I&#xD;
took it with me to the Lodge and locked it. carefully in&#xD;
my secretary, waiting until the next day before I&#xD;
proceeded further, for it was now late. My mind was&#xD;
so alive with this new hope that II slept very little dur-&#xD;
ing the night and rose bright and early the next morn-&#xD;
ing. II pushed back my window curtain, and there&#xD;
before mc was a white carpet, for it had snowed during&#xD;
the night as it can only snow in Merry England. The&#xD;
snow was still softly falling; the large fleecy flakes were&#xD;
comiffg down in myriads, gently and slowly. It had&#xD;
fallen on the tree tops, dressing the bare branches with&#xD;
a robe of virgin white, even the dark grove wearing a&#xD;
dress. of spotlc~s purity, and over the dreary moorland&#xD;
was a pure, smooth carpet, ~n~roken by a foot-print.&#xD;

I stood there some time watching it, and thinking of&#xD;
the little trinket, when Patrick's head, rivaling the&#xD;
scene without in whiteness, peeped in, exclaiming:&#xD;
"Why, are you ~up, master? I thought to wake&#xD;
you, but here you are dressed."&#xD;
"Yes, up and dressed. Any mail, Patrick 'h"'&#xD;
"Yes, a note and a letter."&#xD;
"A. note! From whom 9"&#xD;
"Dr. Arnold's servant gave it Lo me and told mc to&#xD;
give it to you immediately."&#xD;
I broke the note open hastily. lit ran as follows:&#xD;
DEAR Fz~zEND:&#xD;
I am at the sick bed of Godfrey Laughton, and wish you to&#xD;
come here immediately, for strange things may be revealed.&#xD;
Yours in haste,&#xD;
T. J. ARNOLD.&#xD;
I read the letter, which w~s from the old duke. It&#xD;
was full of kindness and sympathy~ , and trusting that&#xD;
we might still do something to liberate the prisoner.&#xD;
I was very much surprised when my eyes fell upon&#xD;
th ~se words in the letter:&#xD;
Yesterday, as I was passing by an artist's gallery, I entered&#xD;
to examine the pictures, and I was very much surprised to see a&#xD;
small oil painting of that very pretty girl, Miss ~Vayland, to whom&#xD;
you introduced me the last time I visited you. The picture is a&#xD;
very true and a very lovely one, and 'the ~costume it is taken in&#xD;
exceedingly bec~ning. The artist told me it was in the posses-&#xD;
sion of Mr. God~yLa~g1~ton, who wished to have it remodeled.&#xD;
I-Low did this l)icttlre come into (xodfrey Laughtou'~&#xD;

IanJ gave Gerald, and how did Godfrey Laughton get&#xD;
it? I thought of this and much moro as I rode to his&#xD;
house. I was not long in arriving at my journey's&#xD;
cn~, and never was Merry Hall so quiet 'as it was this&#xD;
morniPg. The servants walked about noiselessly and&#xD;
spoke in whispers, and it altogether appeared very sol-&#xD;
cain. The butler took me into a warm sitting ro@m,&#xD;
where a blazing fire burned in the grate, casting out a&#xD;
ruddy glow and making the apartment very comfort~&#xD;
- ble. I asked for the doctor, and, taking a chair, sat&#xD;
looking into the red coals, wondering what the result&#xD;
of' my visit here would be.&#xD;
"A bitter cold morning, Meredith," said the doctor,&#xD;
coming in rubbing his hands. "How did you navigate',&#xD;
through the snow? You didn't meet with an avalanche,&#xD;
did you?&#xD;
"Oh, no. I got on pretty well. How a~e you feel-.&#xD;
ing to-day, doctor?"&#xD;
"So-.so,'~ and drawing a chair up to the fire, 'he&#xD;
motioned me to come near to him.&#xD;
I seated myself very 'cldse, and ,he leaned forward&#xD;
and commenced:&#xD;
"Meredith, it has all been as I expected. I am an&#xD;
old man, and experience has given me much penetra-&#xD;
tion, but I did not wish to hang a man on my suspi-.&#xD;
dons merely and without some positive proof; but I&#xD;
have that no~v. The wild delirium made him tell '~a&#xD;
tale which was fearful, fearful. Could you have heard&#xD;
what I did through the still hours of the night the&#xD;
blood in your veins would have been frozen. It was&#xD;

"who severed the soul from the body under the firs."&#xD;

I sprang to my feet and caught his arm.&#xD;
"Doctor!"&#xD;
"Be quiet, friend, 1)0 quiet. Much depends on our&#xD;
being calm."&#xD;
~lie then motioned me to follow him, and led me up&#xD;
stairs into the patient's room. it was an elegantly fur-.&#xD;
nished apartment, comfortable and luxurious, where&#xD;
not a breath of the winter wind dare enter; but Ii&#xD;
thought little of this as I approached the bed where&#xD;
lay the sick man, tossing restlessly, and unconscious.&#xD;
His handsome face was covem~ed over with a scarlet&#xD;
mantle of fevcr and his eyes were wild and glaring.&#xD;
The doctor motioned me to a seat at the head of the bed&#xD;
and he took one on the opposite side. The invalid was&#xD;
muttering to himself; but I could not understand what&#xD;
he was saying, though I bent over and listened atten-.&#xD;
tively. I waited a long time~and had grown very&#xD;
tired. I raised myself up at last, thinking it was no&#xD;
use and that my kind friend snust have been mistaken,&#xD;
but he nodded to mc, and I resumed my former posi-.&#xD;
tion. I had scarcely done so when I caught Gerald's&#xD;
name and "Those glaring eyes, why don't they "---then&#xD;
something followed that I could not understand, then&#xD;
some disconnected sentences were muttered like these:&#xD;
"Blood stop flowing." "Little gaiter somewhere&#xD;
there." "Blood' on picture and it wdn't wash out."'&#xD;
"I'd kill a dozen to marry "-. "The gibbet Will rid&#xD;

"Will that confirm what I have told you," said the&#xD;
doctor, stooping over, and looking inc in the eye.&#xD;
I bowed my head and sat silent some time. The&#xD;
picture he spoke of must have been the one of Amy's&#xD;
that Gerald had, and the little gaiter the one she had&#xD;
found under the firs. As. I thought of this I remem-&#xD;
bered that I had seen him hunting for something there&#xD;
some months ~before, and was struck at the time with&#xD;
the strangeness of the proceeding.&#xD;
I went with all haste back to the Lodge and dis-&#xD;
patched to the duke to havethe picture of Amy exam-&#xD;
ined to see if there were any signs of blood upoi~ it.&#xD;
I soon received a return telegram, saying the picture&#xD;
had be~n examined, kit that there were no marks upon&#xD;
it. I was very much depressed at this and quite in a&#xD;
state of bewilderment, for if there were no trace of blood&#xD;
upon the picture, what right had we to pay attention&#xD;
to anything The sick man had said'? The only thing&#xD;
that was left to cheer mc now was thd shoe, for he had&#xD;
spoken of that too in his delirium; but then I thought&#xD;
he might have ped that at any other time. All&#xD;
my hopes seeI~ain blighted, and we could only&#xD;
wait now until ~~~ick man recovered and see what&#xD;
steps we should take next. I was fully convinced, as&#xD;
was also Dr. Arnold, that~ Godfrey Laughton was the&#xD;
guilty one.&#xD;
Old Patrick brought up my tea to my room that&#xD;
evening, for he used to sit with inc now, and. I was&#xD;
never weary of his companionship. I sat down to take&#xD;
a mouthful of the tea and a little toast, when. the loud&#xD;
ring of the doQr-bell quite startled ~me, for this was&#xD;

&#xD;
something new in our quict lives at the Lodge, where&#xD;
we never had visitors in the winter evenings.&#xD;
"Who is it, PatrieF ?"&#xD;

found him warming his han(ls. There was another&#xD;

sal(l&#xD;
"Mr. Meredith, after the reception of your dispatch,&#xD;
I was very much excited, and I went immediately and&#xD;
had the picture examined, which did not result in any&#xD;
discovery. When I returned to my room I could not.&#xD;
rest, I was so anxious~ about it, and went the second&#xD;
time with more success. IL had a very strong magni-&#xD;
fying glass with which I bad it examined, closely, and&#xD;
weTound a spot upon it, which, upon b~ing analyzed,&#xD;
proved to be blood. I have brought the picture with&#xD;
me," he continued, walking to a table and taking it&#xD;
from a portfolio, and handing it to me.&#xD;
I took it to the brilliant gaslight, but failed to det~~t&#xD;
the spot upoii it.&#xD;
"I see you (10 not perceive ~ said the duke, "nor&#xD;
could I at first." lie then pointed to one of the cor-&#xD;
ncrsr where I saw for the first time a very tiny, faint&#xD;
spot, which many careful ablutions had ~almost oblit-&#xD;

chemist had retired, " how did this painting come into&#xD;

Xes~ indeed, uncle, that we will ; so insist upon&#xD;
Lord Leigh's coming in here and making himself coin~&#xD;
It was not necessary to urge him further; he jumped&#xD;
from his horse upon hearing her voice, and went to the&#xD;
carriage door, saying:&#xD;
"So, Miss Amy, you are out in the cold, too ; this is&#xD;
what mother would call, 'l)ravin(r the lion in his den.'&#xD;
I K~el myself very much like the 'old woman wrapped&#xD;
nra in the blanket,' " tryil]g to extricate his hands from&#xD;
th ~ wrappings around him, "but this is not my fault,&#xD;
Al jss Amy, I did it to oblige mamma, who would think&#xD;
in ~ ears would be frost-bitten if I did not obey her."&#xD;
"And your mamma is right~-but just hear the bells.&#xD;
the silver bells," she broke on; looking out the win~&#xD;
dow as several sleighs passed by.&#xD;
ji[ don't want to hear them again~ for yesterday I&#xD;
was riding with poor little Lillian and the sleigh upset,&#xD;
and I made a vow that I would never sleigh-ride anv&#xD;
moic.&#xD;
"That you will break some of these days~ and I sus~&#xD;
peet before the snow will leave," answered Amy.&#xD;
We had now arrived at the Lodge, and Lord LeigW&#xD;
umped from the eam~iage and assisted Amy out, After&#xD;

&#xD;
I had introduced Amy into the sitting~rOOm where the&#xD;
duke was, I drew Lord Leigh apart and. told him what&#xD;
had passed. Whilst Ii spoke his eyes sparkled, and he&#xD;
seemed all eagerness to begin with the evidence we had&#xD;
to clear the prisoner. I then told the duke that we&#xD;
had better commence at once to take down the notes,&#xD;
as Lord Leigh's time w~s 'limited.&#xD;
I went up stairs for the picture which the duke had&#xD;
brought, and which I had put into my secretary the&#xD;
night before. 4s I took it from its resting~plaeC, I&#xD;
drew with it the little gold shoe. II hastily picked it&#xD;
up and went down stairs with it in my hand. When&#xD;
I went into the room. the company gathered around&#xD;
me. I handed the picture to the duke, who gave it to&#xD;
Amy, sayiiig:&#xD;
"Do you recognize this?"&#xD;
"Of course I do, my Lord," said the girl, inno-&#xD;
cently. "This is one of two pictures that was painted&#xD;
for me in July, 18~."&#xD;
"Well, how did you dispose of this one?" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"IL did not dispose of it myself. My fatheV gave it&#xD;
to Gerald, heir of Gordon, shortlyy after it was taken."&#xD;
* "But, my child," said the old man, "could yo~m&#xD;
swear that this was the one?"&#xD;
"Yes," she returned, "there were only two&#xD;
and she walked to the pia1~o, where her muff and gloves&#xD;
lay, and brought the corresponding picture.&#xD;
The duke took the two pktures in his hands.&#xD;
Bes~des~" said Amy, "there was another ~mark or&#xD;
two by which I would know the one that papa gave&#xD;
away from mine, There was a scratch across the neck,&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
made by xnammas shawl-pin, which ma:~;:±~ thought&#xD;
disfigured it greatly, and she was glad it was that one&#xD;
that papa gave to Gerald."&#xD;
We all looked eagerly at the picture and saw there&#xD;
the scratch which she had described.&#xD;
"And besides this mark, there were three Arabic&#xD;
characters on the back of the canvass, Which Paul&#xD;
painted in Indian ink one evening. I don't know&#xD;
what they stand for, tliowrh," she continued.&#xD;
We turned the j)icturc and looked at the back, and&#xD;
there saw very plainly the three clmracters which she&#xD;
had. told us of and we all felt now perfectly satisfied&#xD;
as to the identity of the picture.&#xD;
The duke then asked if there was anyone present&#xD;
~vhen her father gave this away, and she answered:&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Laughton."&#xD;
He then looked at me significantly and I returned&#xD;
his glance. I raised up from the table on which I had&#xD;
been leaning, and, in doing so, knocked the little trin~&#xD;
ket to the floor. Lord Leigh stooped and picked it&#xD;
up. lie looked ~t it long and curiously.&#xD;
"My Lord," I asked, whilst my heart l)alPitated&#xD;
very rapidly, "(lid you ever sce that before?"&#xD;
"Yes, Nir. Meredith."&#xD;
" Where, my Lord ?"&#xD;
"On Godfrcy La'~ghton's watch-chain. It was&#xD;
given to him by a friend of mine and I[ was present&#xD;
when it was presei~te~(."&#xD;
"Have you seen him wear it very lately?" I asked,&#xD;
comin~ close to him.&#xD;
"No, I hav'nt seen it for some time, and I was very&#xD;
much surprised when I picked it up heie on the floor."&#xD;

hands, and then siiid:&#xD;
"Yes, I do remember now, perfectly. We were&#xD;
huntin~ together on the eighteenth of Au~ust, the d~y&#xD;

fence, and. his watch, which was carelessly placed n&#xD;
his vest pocket, fell out and hung by the chain, a~ 4&#xD;

too, assisted in the hunt. F-found it, after some time,&#xD;
by the briJlianey of the stones shining amongst' some&#xD;
leaves. As I handed it to him he said it had a trick&#xD;
of falling from his chain, and he must go the next&#xD;
week to a jeweler and have it made secure.~,&#xD;
"And this is positively the last time you saw it?"&#xD;
"Positively, the last," was the answer4 "It~ looks,&#xD;
though," he added, '~ as if it had been very badly&#xD;
treated. Mr. Meredith, where did you get it?"&#xD;
I answered-'&#xD;
"That Amy bad found it in the grove of firs on the&#xD;
moorland. And what do you think of it?" I con~&#xD;

for the worse; her eyes were wild and staring, and she scarcely&#xD;
spoke to me; would eat nothing, and drove her maid from her&#xD;
presence altogether. A friend called to see me, and I was obliged&#xD;
to leave her for a little while. When I returned she was absent,&#xD;
and when I enquired of the servants if they knew where their&#xD;
mistress was, their answers were a I in the negative. I could not&#xD;
gain the slightest information from any one. I have searche~i&#xD;
everywhere and am still searching, but it seems fruitless. I trust&#xD;
you above all others, and I ~vish you would make enquiries. I&#xD;
have heard of the suspicions which rest ~upon Laughton. I am&#xD;
very much relieved, for I never co~ild thir~k that it was Paul that&#xD;
had robbed inc of my only child. I told Eleanor about it, but she&#xD;
did not speak, and I could net tell how it affected her. Remember&#xD;
me kindly to Paul, and believe mc your sincere friend,&#xD;

I was very much troubled when I read this letk~'.&#xD;
All Eleanor's bright prospects had come to this. I&#xD;
was still musing upon it when a boy came up a~~id&#xD;
handed me a telegram, saying:&#xD;
"This has just come for you, sir."&#xD;
It ran as follows:&#xD;

I went instantly to the ticket-office and bought a&#xD;
ticket for M-, wrote a short note to Dr. Arnold&#xD;
explaining my absence, and was soon en route. Before&#xD;
starting I sent a telegram to Lord Gordon acquaindng&#xD;
him with Eleanor's whereabouts. I gazed U~9II the&#xD;
wintry sky as the railway carriage hurried on and&#xD;
thought that my life was quite as overcast as it was,&#xD;
my comforts few, my trials many, but if Vaul could b~&#xD;
saved now, the rest of my days promised peace.&#xD;

~vas. throwing his hands around his body to keep&#xD;
them from freezing, engaged him. to drive me to the&#xD;
asylum.&#xD;
I found Doctor Kean a very nice gentleman, and he&#xD;
expressed himself greatly relieved that I had come.&#xD;
lie said that he thought Lady Gordon very ill and a&#xD;
very bad case; she was raving a great (lea!.&#xD;
"it did not know where her husband was or I would&#xD;
have sent for him also," he said.&#xD;
"Ho~v did she get here?" I asked. '1t is at least&#xD;
a hundredd and twenty miles distant from where her&#xD;
husband ~&#xD;
"She came by the early morning train, but was not&#xD;
so bad when she first arrived, and stopped a~ the hotel,&#xD;
where she ordered rooms. Some of her friends recog-&#xD;
nized her there and asked her where her husband was.&#xD;
She said she had killed him, and this was the first inti~.&#xD;
nation they had of her condition; I was sent for&#xD;
immediately, and found her perfectly insane. I dis-.&#xD;
patched at once for you, knowing you to be her&#xD;
relative."&#xD;
"I am very much indebted to you, sir; but cannot I&#xD;
see the patient now?"&#xD;
"Certainly," and he led the way to the ward in&#xD;
which Eleanor was located.&#xD;
She was lying on a bed, raving painfully. When I&#xD;
spoke to her she did not at all recognize me. Shc~&#xD;
called incessantly upon the name of her dead child,&#xD;
It was deeply grieved for her. There was no longer a&#xD;

(hi the following Monday week II was again seated&#xD;

witness against the prisoner at the bar, who was God-&#xD;
frey Laughton. The mo~t of the evidence against him&#xD;
you have heard; but the most convincing was that of&#xD;
two women from the Hall, one of them the, nurse dur-&#xD;
ing the prisoner's illness and the other the assistant.&#xD;
They had been compelled to go into his private ward-&#xD;
robe for some linen whilst he was si~k and found there&#xD;
a shirt and a, pair of linen pants, hidden' away under&#xD;
some other things, which were stained with blood of&#xD;
long standing. It was remembered by his servants&#xD;
that he had w&amp;amp;n a pair of pants that answered to the&#xD;
description of these on the evening of the 19th of&#xD;
August, 18-. The servant~ also gave evidence that&#xD;
he was not at the Hall on that unhappy evening from&#xD;
about six until one at iiight. The evidence against&#xD;
him was very great and convincing, and the verdict&#xD;
pronounced him "guilty."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
HISTORY ANI) CONFESSION OF THE MURDERE[~.&#xD;
WAS                       iMay, 18-,&#xD;
born in Bin o'cn on the iltI&#xD;
and was the third son of a large family. My&#xD;
father was an honest, industrious mechanic,&#xD;
and my motl~r pious and amiable. At an&#xD;
early age I showed talent and vivacity and was con-&#xD;
sidered remarkably handsome. My mother indulged&#xD;
me very much. She was proud of my fair face and&#xD;
graceful carriage, and made her other children succumb&#xD;
to my every wish. We were very poor, and my two&#xD;
older brothers had t~ toil for their daily bread. But&#xD;
I was a little idler, who refused to do anything and was&#xD;
never compelled.&#xD;
"I remember, when I was about eleven years old,&#xD;
my father Was employed building some frame stores&#xD;
for a rich merchant, and would go to his ~vork very&#xD;
early every morning and not return untjl late in the&#xD;
evening. My mother called me to her one day and&#xD;
asked me if I would take my father's dinner to him;&#xD;
that all the other children were absent. I said, 'I&#xD;
reckoned so,' and being tired of nothing to do, picked&#xD;
up the basket that contained his meal and, went b&#xD;
where he wa3 working. II was al~vays bland to stran~&#xD;
gers, and as a general thing attracted them. When I&#xD;
arrived at the place where my fa~hcr was, I found him&#xD;
speaking to a handsomely-dressed gentleman. So,&#xD;
wearing a most~winning smile, I bowed low and handed&#xD;
my father his dinner. T~tk4~tranger eyed mc compla'..&#xD;
gently, ~nd asked:&#xD;
&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
"' Is this your son?&#xD;
"'Yes,' answered my father, feeling flattered that I&#xD;
was thus noticed.&#xD;
"'You are a fine little boy. have you ever been to&#xD;
school ?' said the gentleman, patting me on the head.&#xD;
No, sir.'&#xD;
"'Would you like to go?' he asked.&#xD;
'Ah ! indec(l that I would, sir, above all things,'&#xD;
I answered.&#xD;
" ' Why, Ibis is anhl)ition, an(l that's what I glory&#xD;
in.&#xD;
"Then turning to my father he said&#xD;
'If you will let me have this boy of yours I will&#xD;
educate him as a gentleman, and when he grows older&#xD;
will give him a fine berth in my iuerca~tile estab~&#xD;
"My father was so overpowered with gratitude and&#xD;
delight that he could scarcely speak, anti stro.~ed my&#xD;
fae~ most lovingly. The stranger then asked me:&#xD;
'"how would you like that, my boy?'&#xD;
"'Nothing would give me such pleasure; I would&#xD;
lx: more than clclighted-.-and you are so very kind,'&#xD;
kissing his hand.&#xD;
"He s ~h1cd greatly pleased with mc, and told me&#xD;
to go home now and tell my mother, and that he would&#xD;
cotue for me on the morrow.&#xD;
" I bade him adou, and ran all the way home, full&#xD;
of the idea of LAng a gentleman. When I told my&#xD;
mother she wcp~ very bitterly and said she eonld not&#xD;
hear tc~ gi ye me up, calling me all the while the most&#xD;
cn(learing names. I told her that she did not know&#xD;

what was good for me, that it was all glo4ous, anJ&#xD;
we;it to bed that night with visions of the future as&#xD;
bright ~s sunbeams. I waked early next morning,&#xD;
and foand. that my mother had staid up all night to&#xD;
wash and arrange my scati ty wardrobe. As the day&#xD;
advanced she kissed me again and again, and begged&#xD;
God to bless me. When thp time of parting came, my&#xD;
brothers bade me good-bye with tears in their honest&#xD;
eyes, whilst mine remained nnnioistcned. My little&#xD;
sister was perhaps the only one I j)arted from with aiiy&#xD;
regret. She was so beautiful, and had been such a&#xD;
willing, little slave to me, and I felt that I would miss&#xD;
her very much. I bade her adieu with a tear which&#xD;
was soon dried, and as the sun sank on 'fair Bingen,'&#xD;
I left my paternal roof.&#xD;
"The o~d gentleman took me kindly by the hand&#xD;
when I wa~ telling my father good-bye, thinking that&#xD;
I would fi~cl the parting, but the sorrow was all on&#xD;
one side. 'Good-bye, Oscar, my son, good-bye; don't&#xD;
forget your old father, my child, who loves you so&#xD;
~bndly.' He kissed my cheeks whilst the big teats&#xD;
fell fast upon them, but I ~was unmoved. The stranger&#xD;
then put mc if~ his carriage, and shaking hands with&#xD;
my ~arcnts jumped in after me. The last words I&#xD;
ever heard my fatl~er say were: 'Oscar, my son, don't&#xD;
forget me.'&#xD;
"I was not at all abashed before the strange man,&#xD;
ror I was neyer afraid of strangers, and talked a great&#xD;

ambitious and brilliant, and stood first in all my&#xD;
classes, and at eighteen was considered su~lciently&#xD;
capable of faking my stand in the mercantile house.&#xD;
M~ old patron was very kind to me, and seemed very&#xD;
proud that I had succeeded so well. After my return&#xD;
to Bingen, I was installed as head clerk in one of his&#xD;
establishments. My kind friend was never weary of&#xD;
serving my interests. I made myself as agreeable to&#xD;
him as possible and feigned an unusual amount of&#xD;
gratitude.&#xD;
"One evening as I was pouring over some accounts,&#xD;
my benefactor camein, and said:&#xD;
4     "'Oscar ny boy, I bear you have not been to see&#xD;
your fami~ yet; put up those books and go to them,~&#xD;
boy.'&#xD;
"I was ashamed to confess that it was pride that&#xD;
had prevented me from visiting them, and made the&#xD;
e: ceuse that it was 'press of business.'&#xD;
"'Make tl~at an excuse no longer, Oscar, for I want&#xD;
y~ji to pay a visit to them every day.'&#xD;
"I was half angry at this, for I would rather not&#xD;
have visited the scenes where I had once been a poor&#xD;

long afte+ this, but left the house vowing that an&#xD;
estrangement should soon take place between. this&#xD;
youi~g couple. Ii very soon after this introduced my&#xD;
bosom friend to my family; he was on a Par with&#xD;
myself; and was very soon enamored of my sister's&#xD;
charms. I determined that she should marry him, but&#xD;
she gave him no encour~geflieflt~ which enraged us&#xD;
both. We ~nade up our minds to dispatch my friend's&#xD;
rival as soon as possible. it was on a summer even-&#xD;
ing that we had planned to meet him, as he was return-&#xD;
ing from his work on the outskirts of the city, and it&#xD;
was arranged that I shouh-l insult 'him, and a dud&#xD;
w~uld ensue, in which I promised myself every advai ~-&#xD;
t:ige. A demon urged me, and on I went. We m.t,&#xD;
and in every possible way I provoked him. At fir~t,&#xD;
he bore with mc very calmly, but at length his tempt r&#xD;
was roused; and he took the pistol I proffered, ai~d sa~ ti&#xD;
he would fight. I would not allow him time to call a&#xD;
second, but made my companion measure the groun 1,&#xD;
and we took OlTir stand, the signal was given and ~&#xD;
fired, and my sister's affianced husband fell dead upon&#xD;
the grass. The blue Rhine flowed inurmuringly along&#xD;
as if to chide me for my evil deed, and. I fled from the&#xD;
spot, my companion following me, without being either*&#xD;
pursued or suspected. I never forgot the next evening&#xD;
whcn II called at my mother's home. There lay my&#xD;
sister cold and motionless, with a broken heart; she&#xD;
never smiled again, nor spoke to any of us; she turned&#xD;
from me instinctively as if she knew I was th~ cause&#xD;
of all her sorrow, and three weeks from that day I&#xD;
followed her to her home in the churchyard~ For a&#xD;

time I felt a great grief; but it wore away at last. The&#xD;
suspicions of the murder never rested upon me, but I&#xD;
thought it would be better for me to be far away from&#xD;
my native land. The spirits of the4wo beings I had&#xD;
sent to an early grave were continually haunting me,&#xD;
and I determined to leave-but how was I to accom-&#xD;
push this without friends or money? At length, I&#xD;
concluded to forge a check upon my bcnefactoi"s house.&#xD;
I soon after put this dctei4Anation into execution, and&#xD;
found myself in possession of fifty thousand pounds,&#xD;
and on the evening of that same day, after passing the&#xD;
churchyard to cast one more glance on tjie ~ravc of my&#xD;
poor sister, I left the vine clad hills as the setting sun&#xD;
was bathing them in a rosy twilight forever. I&#xD;
assumed a disguise that was so complete, that I was&#xD;
never recognized. After a time, I went over into Ire-&#xD;
land, where I became acquainted with Captain Way-&#xD;
land, and assisted him in his ~dopement with Miss&#xD;
since,  soon became tired of Ireland, and came over&#xD;
Oswald,    he and II have been boon companions ever&#xD;
into England, and adopted th~ manners and costume&#xD;
of the Englishman, as jwell as his country, leading as&#xD;
gay a life as pQ55iblC to banish the phantoms of the&#xD;
past. This I ~early done. tim&#xD;
had i         ,    e passed aw~~ and&#xD;
all seemed to be going on well, when Amy Wayland&#xD;
arrived from Paris. I had never loved in all my&#xD;
life, but she was so winning, so lovely, and so gentle,&#xD;
that I soon became captive to her womanly graces and&#xD;
charms; her image was constantly before me, and I&#xD;
loved her wildly and passionately. When I heard she&#xD;
was betrothed to Paul Stewart, I became 'almost fran-.&#xD;

&#xD;
'iic, and the night of Lady Grantly's ball, I heard the&#xD;
coiwersation between hini and Amy, and bit my lips&#xD;
until the blood flowed. (I loved her so, that I would&#xD;
not bring her name before the public court, although&#xD;
I knew it was she to whom Paul was speaking~-I pre~&#xD;
ferred perjuring myself.) I also heard tim converse~&#xD;
tion between Lady Gordon and Captain WTayland the&#xD;
same ni~ht and I knew this wa3 the stronger party,&#xD;
and was the one to fear. I was confident, though, that&#xD;
Amy loved Paul ,~so I r~solvcd then and there to get&#xD;
/ ri~l of my two rivals. I never liked Gerald Gordon-&#xD;
poor, weak hoy-but now I hated him, as I thought&#xD;
he would be successful. I liked Stewart infinitely&#xD;
better, but I consigned him to a far worse fate, think-&#xD;
ing that Amy would cease to love him when she heard&#xD;
him branded as a felon. You all know ~vhen the&#xD;
engagement between Gerald and Amy was made pub--&#xD;
lie.  'sowed theii to murder hun and bring evidence&#xD;
/ so roiig against Paul Stewart that he would be&#xD;
indicted. The night of the 19th of August came at&#xD;
£    la~t, the next sun would shine upon the marriage day,&#xD;
ai~d thiS was my last chance for action; now, how was&#xD;
I to commit the deed without being suspected myself?&#xD;
I ~iad been thinking about it for a whole week. You&#xD;
all~ remember that in my evidence I told you that I&#xD;
4bund Paul Stewart standing beneath one of the trees&#xD;
snot far from the grove on that night. II knew he was&#xD;
'niourning over luis~sad fate, and that in 'his heart there&#xD;
raged a tempest as 'fearful as the one in which l~~tood.&#xD;
lie did not mind the pelting rain, the mutt6rin~j~hiin&#xD;
der, or the y1y~d lightning, they accorded but too well&#xD;
&#xD;
with his own feelings; but my heart palpitated wildly&#xD;
when I saw him. It knew that Gerald Gordon had&#xD;
not returned from 13 , for I had made all enqui-&#xD;
vies. So, after bidding IDrew good night, under the&#xD;
j)retence of hastening home, I passed across the lower&#xD;
end of the moorland, tied my horse in a thicket&#xD;
beyond, an(l hurried back, but here I met with an&#xD;
obstruction; i[ was obliged to pass by Mrs. carr's&#xD;
cabin, the door was open and a stream of light fell in.&#xD;
my path; the woman was at the door, and her keen&#xD;
eye recognizing me, she asked me where I was going&#xD;
in such a storm.&#xD;
"I walked rapidly on without answering, hoping&#xD;
that she would imagine herself mistaken. I first went&#xD;
to the spot where 'I[ had left Paul Stewart, and, to my&#xD;
satisfaction, found him gone. I then entered the grove-&#xD;
of firs, and did not have to wait very long until It heard&#xD;
Gerald Gordon's horse coming towards me. I call&#xD;
up all my courage here. His horse, generally so rest-&#xD;
I&#xD;
we and fiery, was as tractable as a lamb. I caught it&#xD;
by th~ bridle as it came up to me, and threw it back&#xD;
on its haunches. A demon's strength was in my arms.&#xD;
I then jerked the rider from. its back. lie struggled&#xD;
manfully, bY~t I struck' him a blow on his head with&#xD;
my pistol, which stunned him. I pulled him some&#xD;
distancee into the grove. He then returned to con-&#xD;
sciousness and asked, 'Who wiShes to kill me?' and by&#xD;
a lightning flash saw my fkce, and said, 'Is it you,&#xD;
Godfrey?' I coAwd my pistol. lie here begged, for&#xD;
J)ity sake, to l2!~ him pray one moment for mercy. He&#xD;
raised him self upon his knees and said, 'For God's&#xD;

sake, don't kill me.' I pointed my pistol and as he&#xD;
cried 'Lord have mercy' I~ fired, and he fell upon the&#xD;
grass. I then searched in one pocket for the picture&#xD;
of Amy Waylaud, which I had seen him have that&#xD;
very morning, and which he showed mq on his way to&#xD;
town, and irritated mc by asking 'if I would not like&#xD;
to haxre it.~ It was the only thing he possessed that I&#xD;
~coveted, for when I could not have Amy with me, II&#xD;
\iust have this representation of her. So I quickly&#xD;
concealed it in my pocket, and ran in the direction of&#xD;
i~iy horse, which I woon mounted, and hastened to the&#xD;
hal 1. 1 put the. horse away myself; for fear of detec-&#xD;
tion. I[ then opened the Hall door with a night-hey,&#xD;
and went softly up to my chamber. There was my&#xD;
roon~ alt prepared by the careful servants; the lamp&#xD;
was lighted; the curtains all drawn to. I doubly&#xD;
locked the door when I entered. I looked at my&#xD;
clothes; they were stained with' blood. It drew them&#xD;
off hui~icdly, wrapped them np, and put them in a&#xD;
wardrobe which no one entered but myself~ The paint-&#xD;
ing I also hid. I then washed my hands again and&#xD;
again~and took a bath inmy bath-room, and threw out&#xD;
the water myself; so that none would be the wiser. I&#xD;
could ~not sleep that night, for I eduld see, the dead boy's&#xD;
face peering at mc from every corner of the room. N&#xD;
was afraid to look in any direction. I' shut my eyes,&#xD;
but it was all the same. L dared not walk up and&#xD;
down my chamber floor, for the very sound of my foot-&#xD;
steps ~Vere like echoes from the tomb, and in every&#xD;
shadow cast upon the ceilings or wall I could see iih~&#xD;
murdered boy's dying eyes, and every sigh of the nig~4~~&#xD;

wind seemed to bear upon its breath his' last, words.&#xD;
As the dawn began to break, I sought my bed to avoid&#xD;
suspicion, and I parried it for a long time. I was very&#xD;
much alarmed when I found my little watch-trinket&#xD;
was gone, for I knew it must have fallen that night&#xD;
near the grove, and this kept mc in a wretched state of&#xD;
suspense fQr many days. But as time passed away I&#xD;
thought less of it, though I hunted for it frequently.&#xD;
The stain of blood on the picture annoyed me un'ceas-&#xD;
ingly. II washed it and washed it until I thought it&#xD;
had disappeared altogether. I was so crazy to have it&#xD;
remodeled that I sent it to London, and you all know&#xD;
the consequences. And the few remaining items of my&#xD;
life you are also acquainted with. I have been a wicked&#xD;
man, but my retribution will be very great. Amy&#xD;
Wayland's image has lived with inc and will go with&#xD;
me down to the grave. I dare not ask for pity, for It&#xD;
know you have none to give; but did I know that only&#xD;
one tear would fall for me, It would die happier."&#xD;
This ended the history and the confession, and when&#xD;
we read it, we did not refuse him the tears he sighed&#xD;
for.&#xD;

CONCLUSION.&#xD;
&#xD;
JIE following June, at the little country&#xD;
church, . as the evening sunbeams stole in&#xD;
through the window~,, casting their bright'c&#xD;
rays on the altar and the pictures, two bridal&#xD;
couples entei'ed-and handsomer couples could not be&#xD;
found in all Er~gland. I am sure it ~vill not be hard&#xD;
for my reader to guess who they were. The first th~xt&#xD;
knelt and received the blessing of thq old priest was&#xD;
Lord Leigh and, hi~" airy, fairy Lillian," whb looked&#xD;
lovelier than ever i&amp;amp;her bridal r&amp;amp;bes. The next were&#xD;
my two adopted children, and as I. heard the wor4s,&#xD;
"what God has joined together let no mztli.pufasunder,"&#xD;
I leaned my head upon the railing and went with joy.&#xD;
* Nine halcyon years have passed since then, and we&#xD;
arc now back,, in old Erin, at my childhood's home..&#xD;
All see~ns the s~e here on this summer eve as in. days&#xD;
gone by. The flowers ~re budding rind blooming,,'&#xD;
exhaling their rich perfumes; the fountains are ~~iW&#xD;
playing, whispering sweet music as the crystal drops&#xD;
fall intQ the basin; the silvery~Shannon i~ still mur~~&#xD;
inuring and complaining on to the sea; and Nature is&#xD;
aS lavish with her gifts as she was when I was a child&#xD;
and she was a child.&#xD;
Paul and Amy are noble; loving, and good, and are&#xD;
truly happy, No furrows mark the brow of xny young&#xD;
hero-it i~ as placid as the summer sea-and~ his little&#xD;
wife is a perfect sunbeam, I walk with a stick now,&#xD;
~nd the great znirrQr opposite tells me that my looks&#xD;

are as white as the snow; but I am just as happy as&#xD;
happy can be, and fear that I am a spoiled old man7 as&#xD;
Amy does everything for me. She even parts and&#xD;
smooths my silvery hair, and tells me, laughing, that&#xD;
it looks much prettier after it is touched by her magic&#xD;
fingers..&#xD;
Captain Wayland died three years after Amy's mar~&#xD;
riage, and, I think, was quite repentant. Old Patrick's&#xD;
green grave lies where the silvery waters of the river&#xD;
he loved so well sing to him night and morning. I&#xD;
can see the mound from here, and the myrtle and the&#xD;
roses are twining gracefully over it. There, tooisa&#xD;
monument that rises over a grave bearing the name of&#xD;
Nita. This grave has been carefully attended, and i3&#xD;
a beautiful little spot in itself'.&#xD;
The old duke is still living, but he is very aged. I&#xD;
manage to pay him a visit annually, as he requests it,&#xD;
and I am generally accompanied by Amy and Paul.&#xD;
Lord Leigh and Lillian spend many a pleasant day&#xD;
with us, and, so does Anthony, as gay as ever, whose&#xD;
coming we all hail with joy. He is still fancy free,&#xD;
and laughingly says that Paul ~nd Leigh married the&#xD;
only women he ever wanted6&#xD;
P r Eleanor died in the asylum soon after' being&#xD;
received there6 Lord Gordon lives a lonely life at the&#xD;
Lodge. He seems to care for no one but me. He often&#xD;
sends for me to come to him, and says that my Visits&#xD;
are the only ones that cheer him.&#xD;

The moon is now peeping up from behind the hills,&#xD;
leaving its golden track upon the waters. The night~&#xD;
bh'ds are singing in The distant woods, and as it is get.&#xD;

ting late, I must bid adieu to my manuscript. ~But&#xD;
just down here in the yard is a little figure clothed in&#xD;
spotless muslin, while the night breezes are liftig the&#xD;
brown curls from her fair forehead. I look down and&#xD;
ask he, "Nita, my little pet, what' are you doing ?"&#xD;
She throws me a kiss from her cherry lips with her tiny&#xD;
hand, saying, " Helping little Johnnie water my grand--&#xD;
