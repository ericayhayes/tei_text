            <head>ADDRESS TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT may be that those who dwell in Northern latitudes may believe that we have thrown
               too fair a colouring over our pictures of Southern life, and that we have attempted
               to palliate traits in themselves harsh and repulsive. Being a native of the North,
               and a dweller of the South, with affections strongly clinging to both of the
               beautiful divisions of our common country, we trust that we have brought to the task
               an unprejudiced mind, a truthful spirit, and an earnest and honest purpose.</p>
            <p>It has been our destiny to be something of a wanderer, and to dwell in several of the
               Southern States, and we can say, in all truth and sincerity, that the view of the
               social institutions of the South presented in the following pages is what we
               ourselves have witnessed; and as no one will accuse us of having set down <emph>aught
                  in malice,</emph> so we can assert we have in <emph>nothing extenuated.</emph> We
               believe, if the domestic manners of the South were more generally and thoroughly
               known at the North, the prejudices that have been gradually building up a wall of
               separation between these two divisions of our land would yield to the irresistible
               force of conviction.</p>
            <p>The description of Mr. Bellamy's plantation is drawn from the <emph>real,</emph> not
               the <emph>ideal.</emph> The incident recorded of Mrs. Bellamy, of her endeavouring to
               rescue the mulatto girl from the flames at the risk of her own life, occurred during
               the last winter in our city. The lady who really performed the heroic and
               self-sacrificing deed is a friend of our own, and we saw her when her scarred and
               bandaged hands bore witness to her humanity and sufferings.</p>
            <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6692-00000004"/>
            <p>The chivalry of the sable pilot, and the disinterestedness and heroism of the lady
               whom he rescued, were exhibited, about a year since, on the waters of the
               Chattahoochee.</p>
            <p>We have seen devotion and fidelity equal to Aunt Milly's, and the magnanimity of
               Hannibal has many a prototype among the dark sons of Africa.</p>
            <p>Under circumstances of peculiar interest has this work been written. The perusal of
               its chapters, as they have been completed day after day, has beguiled the weary and
               painful hours of an invalid husband, whose suggestive mind has corresponded to the
               movements of our own: and when we have seen disease thus robbed of its sting, and
               confinement of its depressing influence, we have hoped the work might find its way to
               the couch of some other sufferer, and occasion even a temporary oblivion of
               anguish.</p>
            <p>We have also had the privilege of reading the manuscript to some intelligent and
               literary friends; and when we recall the interest they have manifested in its pages,
               and the frank and hearty encouragement they have given us during its progress, we
               feel emboldened to hope, that the public will judge us as kindly, and do equal
               justice to the motives that actuated us.</p>

               <p>"HARK!" exclaimed Mr. Warland, rising from his chair and walking with an unsteady
                  step to the door, which he opened with a shaking hand. "Hark! there is some one
                  shouting from the opposite bank of the river. Light the lantern, Marcus. Quick, I
                  say. What are you standing in that blast for? Give it to me, and not keep me
                  waiting here all night."</p>
               <p>Snatching the lantern from the hands of his son, he seized the tongs and tried to
                  bring the glaring coal in contact with the wick; but though he blew his hot breath
                  in strong gusts upon it, and produced a bright flame, his wavering hand was unable
                  to carry it through the open door of the lantern. Setting down the tongs, or
                  rather throwing them on the hearth, he swung the lantern back into the hands of
                  his son, who immediately lighted it, closed the door, and took down his cap from
                  the wall.</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do with your cap, sir?" asked Mr. Warland.</p>
               <p>"Going with you, sir," firmly, but respectfully, answered the boy.</p>
               <pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6692-00000005"/>
               <p>"And what good are you going to do me, I want to know? The night is as dark as
                  pitch, and the wind howling like a pack of wolves."</p>
               <p>"That's the reason I want to go with you, sir. It is not the first time I have
                  been out with you when it is dark as it is now?"</p>
               <p>"True, true," said the father, rubbing his forehead with his hands, "but if Katy
                  wakes she will be frightened at finding herself alone."</p>
               <p>"She never wakes, father; and if she does, Aunt Milly will hear her from the
                  kitchen, and come to her directly."</p>
               <p>"Poor thing," cried the father, in a softer tone, looking down upon a
                  pale-cheeked, dark-haired little girl of about eight years old, fast asleep in a
                  low cot-bed, in the back part of the room. "Poor thing!" repeated he, stooping
                  over and kissing her, "what has she ever done that she should be cursed too?"</p>
               <p>"Father! they are shouting again, louder than ever," said the boy. "Hadn't we
                  better start?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—wait one moment." He opened the door of a small cupboard in the darkest
                  corner of the apartment, and taking out a black bottle, began to pour a
                  light-coloured fluid in a glass. He was just putting it to his lips, when Marcus
                  stepped quickly up, and laying his hand on his arm, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"No, father, you must not drink that now. You cannot ferry the boat steadily if
                  you do, and the wind is so strong."</p>
               <p>"Let me alone, boy. What right have you to prevent me? Let me alone, I say."</p>
               <p>"Please, father. It's wrong. You don't know what you are doing. You just now said
                     <emph>she</emph> was cursed—you know you did—and yet you are going——Nay,
                  father, you shall not drink that before you start."</p>
               <p>The resolute boy snatched the glass from his father's hand, and dashed the
                  contents in the fire. A sudden illuminating blaze flashed through the room, as
                  suddenly producing a pale-blue flame, curling slenderly upward. Then darting
                  through the door, he waved his lantern in the air, and gave the peculiar halloo of
                  the boatman to indicate to the waiting traveller that the ferry was about to cross
                  the river. Mr. Warland, who would have wrestled with a man who endeavoured by mild
                  means to deprive him of the burning beverage, by which he sought to stimulate his
                  dulled and exhausted spirits, yielded to the bold will of a boy of ten, without
                  daring to resist, and followed him, muttering, not loudly but deeply, out of the
                  cabin. Marcus hoisted the lantern on a slight post that was elevated at the end of
                  the boat, but so as not to interfere with the entrance of carriages, and seizing
                  one pole, gave the other without speaking into his father's hand. The river had a
                  strong, rapid current, so that they were obliged to go up the stream some distance
                  before they were able to cross it. The lantern threw a red wake on the dark water,
                  over which the boat glided heavily and sullenly, though now Mr. Warland emulated
                  the vigorous strokes of the pole which was swayed by the youthful arm of his son.
                  He did not speak, for he was angry and ashamed, yet with his anger and shame an
                  exulting pride in his son was mingled. He was proud of the boy, who dared to
                  control his brutal appetite, and save him momentarily from a yet deeper
                  degradation. As he looked upon his slight figure thrown back, standing out in the
                  glare of the lantern, while he pressed the pole with all his strength against the
                  rushing water, and thought what he might have made of him, and what his probable
                  destiny now was, he could not suppress a groan of remorse.</p>
               <p>"You are tired, father," said Marcus. "But never mind," he added, in an
                  encouraging tone, "we shall soon be over, and we don't have to tug as hard coming
                  back."</p>
               <p>One would have supposed that <emph>he</emph> was the elder and stronger of the
                  two, to hear his inspiring tone.</p>
               <p>"This is a sorry life we lead," said the father, speaking for the first time since
                  the rebellious act of Marcus. "Obliged to be called out like a dog, in the darkest
                  night and the roughest<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC6692-00000006"/> winds, for anybody
                  and everybody. I don't mind it in the daytime; but when the heavens scowl as black
                  as they do now, and the water looks like ink beneath us, I feel as if I were on
                  the gloomy Styx, on my way to the infernal regions."</p>
               <p>"I like it better in the night, father. It is so much more exciting. I don't care
                  how dark it is; we can turn the boat into a comet, and send out a long, red
                  streamer, that looks grandly enough behind us. As for the wind, the stronger the
                  better. I love to hear the river roar after us. It sounds like music to me.
                  Hoorah! father, here we are, and here is a carriage waiting for us, sure
                  enough."</p>
               <p>The rough, grinding sound of the boat upon the gravelly bank, and a sudden jerk
                  which almost threw Mr. Warland from his feet, but which Marcus stood without a
                  vibration, gave notice to the occupants of the carriage that the ferry was ready
                  for them to cross. The horses came slowly, and tightly reined, down the steep
                  bank, and stepped with thundering hoofs on the wet planks of the boat, which
                  pushed off the moment the wheels rolled from the sand. A gentleman and lady were
                  in the carriage, and the lady leaned on the shoulder of the gentleman, as if
                  feeble and weary. She was wrapped up daintily in rich shawls, and blankets were
                  placed in the bottom of the carriage to cover her feet. There was a young black
                  girl too on the front seat, but her dark outline was scarcely distinguishable amid
                  the dark shadows of night. When the boat was about halfway over the river, the
                  horses began to be restless and step backward and forward, much to the alarm of
                  the lady. Lifting her languid head from her husband's shoulder, she insisted upon
                  getting out of the carriage.</p>
               <p>"There is no danger, Isabel," said her husband. "Keep quiet, and do not expose
                  yourself to taking cold, by this needless alarm." But even while he was speaking
                  the horses went back still farther, though the driver stood at their head, with a
                  controlling arm. Forgetting her fatigue and debility, the lady jumped out, while
                  her husband, finding it in vain to reason with her, followed, and taking one of
                  the blankets, threw it on the bottom of the boat for her to stand on; and gathered
                  her shawls round her, which the strong winds were filling like the sails of a
                  ship.</p>
               <p>"Look, husband," she whispered, "look at that boy—what a beautiful face and figure
                  he has!" Marcus was standing, with his right hand grasping the long pole, by which
                  he was propelling the boat, while with his left he pushed back the locks that were
                  blowing over his temples. The blaze of the lantern fell full upon him, and lighted
                  him up with a pale glory, while the thick shadows all settled behind him, in a
                  kind of rich, Rembrandt background. Though he had been recklessly, fearlessly
                  exposed to the sun and wind, regardless of their bronzing influence, his cheek and
                  brow were as fair as a girl's; and his fair hair too, long and curling, floated
                  back from his forehead, with a wild grace and glossiness, as if it were born to
                  sport with the river-breeze that so often wantoned with its profusion. His eyes
                  were of a clear, deep, cerulean blue, with very dark lashes, and his finely-formed
                  eyebrows were also of a much darker hue than his hair. His mouth, beautiful as the
                  Apollo Belvidere's, had also the slightly scornful expression that curls the
                  parted lip of the young divinity. He certainly was a very remarkable-looking boy
                  for a ferryman's son, and the lady forgot her alarm while gazing upon him, and the
                  gentleman his fears for the lady. <emph>He</emph> was struck with the mind, the
                  spirit that breathed from that boyish face—<emph>she</emph> with the striking
                  beauty of its lineaments—<emph>both</emph> with the contrast he presented to the
                  rude occupation in which he was engaged. The boy caught their earnest gaze, and
                  turning with a quick, deep blush, he again bent over the pole, which began to dip
                  in a deeper, stronger current. When they reached the opposite bank, the lady and
                  gentleman held a low conversation, and then the gentleman, turning courteously to
                  Mr. Warland, asked him if he knew of any house of entertainment near, where they
                  could pass the night,<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6692-00000007"/> as Mrs. Bellamy was
                  very much fatigued, and unwilling to travel farther in the darkness.</p>
               <p>"There is no house of entertainment at all," answered Mr. Warland, "within several
                  miles of here, and no house within a mile. The roads are very bad, and there is a
                  very steep hill to go up before you reach it."</p>
               <p>"What shall I do?" exclaimed the lady, looking anxiously at the log cabin before
                  them; "I cannot, I dare not travel farther to-night. Cannot this good man give us
                  a bed?"</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry, madam," replied Mr. Warland, with much more politeness of manner
                  than they expected from a ferryman, "I cannot offer you any suitable
                  accommodations. My cabin is too rough and ill-furnished to ask you to sit down in,
                  much less to sleep in."</p>
               <p>"I don't care for accommodations," she cried, earnestly. "No matter how rough the
                  bed, how coarse the fare, I will not complain; but I cannot ride with these wild
                  horses any farther this dark night."</p>
               <p>"The horses are not wild, Isabel," said her husband, with a smile. "They are very
                  safe and manageable; but I know you are a coward, and cannot help it. If this
                  gentleman is willing to take us in for the night, I shall certainly be under
                  obligations to him, for your sake."</p>
               <p>"If I had a bed," stammered Mr. Warland, ashamed and vexed at his poverty, well
                  knowing that it was the curse he had drawn upon himself, and that he too once eat
                  the bread of affluence.</p>
               <p>"Let us give them <emph>our</emph> bed, father," said Marcus in a low voice,
                  approaching close to his father; "we can sleep upon the floor."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to put you to inconvenience, my fine boy," cried Mr. Bellamy; "but I
                  thank you very much for your obliging offer. I know Mrs. Bellamy will not refuse
                  it."</p>
               <p>Marcus did not like to be called a "fine boy" by the rich man whom he was about to
                  accommodate. It sounded too patronising. He did not mean that he should hear the
                  offer. He wanted his father to have the credit of it, if there <emph>was</emph>
                  any credit in it, of which he was not at all convinced. He knew what was due to
                  the stranger within one's gate, as well as the children of the wealthy; and there
                  was something about the lady so sweet and winning, her slightest request seemed
                  clothed with the absoluteness of a command. He led the way to the cabin, holding
                  his lantern low so as to illumine the ground where the lady stepped. When they
                  entered, there was certainly nothing very inviting in the aspect of those
                  unlathed, unplastered walls, and poorly-furnished room, to the eye of the delicate
                  and weary traveller; but it was a place of safety, and it was certainly preferable
                  to the danger of bad roads, fiery horses, and a night of inky darkness. The only
                  chairs that were visible were wooden frames, with un-tanned leather bottoms; and a
                  low bedstead, covered with a blue and white woollen counterpane, looked hard and
                  repulsive. Still there was an air of neatness, and even of comfort. There were
                  curtains to the lower part of the windows, which, though made of white domestic,
                  were perfectly neat, and the pillow-cases, and all of the sheets that were
                  visible, were of snowy purity. Mrs. Bellamy sat down on the side of the bed, while
                  the black girl brought in her blankets, and kneeling down, spread one beneath her
                  feet on the uncarpeted floor. Marcus thought the lady's feet must be very dainty
                  things, since they were not allowed to press any thing harder than wool; and he
                  thought, too, how many there were who would be thankful to have those soft, nice
                  blankets to cover them, and shield their bodies from the cold. He threw some
                  pine-knots on the dying embers of the hearth, which soon kindling, a flood of
                  radiance went rolling all over the dark walls, converting them, for the time, into
                  an illuminated dome. The beams overhead, being unfloored, the eye could travel
                  upward to the apex of the roof, so that there was an illusion of loftiness given
                  to the building, low and confined as it was. Mr. Bellamy, who had been with Mr.
                  Warland, to arrange in<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6692-00000008"/> some way for the
                  accommodation of his horses, now entered with the master of the house, and drawing
                  a chair towards the fire, appeared to gladden in the influence of the cheering
                  blaze. He was a fine, benevolent-looking man, with a kindness and heartiness of
                  manner which even Mr. Warland could not resist. He seemed so well satisfied with
                  the accommodations offered, so sorry for the trouble they were giving, it was
                  impossible to grudge a hospitality so gratefully received, and so urgently
                  required.</p>
               <p>The magnificent fireworks in the chimney threw every object out in strong relief,
                  and even suffused with a glow the fair, pale face of the weary lady, who, half
                  reclining on the bed, supported by her elbow, suffered her eye to wander over the
                  group around the fire, though it rested with increasing interest on the
                  remarkable-looking boy, who stood beside her husband with the air of a young
                  aristocrat, in spite of his common apparel. She looked from him to his father, on
                  whose brow the unmistakeable seal of intemperance was stamped, that mark of sin
                  and shame, which grows broader and deeper, till the image of God is utterly
                  defaced. He might once have been a handsome man; for his forehead was lofty, and
                  his features symmetrical; but his eyes had a pale, watery lustre, and his face was
                  bloated and discoloured. He was now, however, perfectly sober, thanks to the bold
                  interference of his dauntless boy before they left the cabin; and as he sat
                  conversing with Mr. Bellamy, the latter was astonished at the ease and refinement
                  of his language. By certain classic allusions, he soon discovered that he had had
                  a collegiate education, and was a fine belles-lettres scholar; and he also learned
                  that he had known some of the most distinguished men of the day; and yet he was
                  located on the banks of that wild stream, in an obscure log-cabin, lonely and
                  poor, a common ferryman, and he was bringing up his noble boy for the same
                  inglorious occupation. These things troubled the benevolent Mr. Bellamy, and he
                  longed to fathom their mystery.</p>
               <p>In the mean time another figure was added to the group, and a very important one
                  in the ferryman's cabin. It was Aunt Milly, the only negro that remained of the
                  wreck of Mr. Warland's fallen fortunes, which she endeavoured to retrieve in the
                  dignity of her single person. She had a great deal of family pride, and
                  notwithstanding the low condition to which her master was reduced, she remembered
                  his former station in society, and in the presence of strangers treated him with
                  marked deference and respect, as if, by clothing him in her imagination with the
                  light of other days, she could cause others to forget his present altered and
                  degraded situation. She had been the nurse of his children, and for two or three
                  years had watched over their desolate and orphan childhood, with the tenderness
                  and devotion of a mother. When Mrs. Warland was on her deathbed, where a broken
                  heart had laid her, she bound her husband, then awakened to a remorseful
                  consciousness of the fatal consequences of his degeneracy, by a solemn promise,
                  never to part with this faithful and attached creature.</p>
               <p>"All the rest are gone," said the dying mother—"all sold, scattered, and broken
                  up—Milly alone remains; she loves my poor children, and will be a mother to them
                  when I am gone. Promise me, as you hope for comfort and pardon in
                     <emph>your</emph> last moments, never to give up this their last friend, their
                  only stay."</p>
               <p>Mr. Warland, in an agony of remorse, promised all she required, and the faithful
                  slave declared they should spill every drop of her heart's blood, sooner than
                  separate her from the children she loved better than her own soul. From that
                  moment she devoted herself to their interests with a fidelity that never wavered,
                  and an affection that never abated. There was no sacrifice too great for their
                  comfort, or too mighty for her love. Let us not be accused of drawing an
                  exaggerated picture of the sable race. "We speak what we do know—we testify to
                  that which we have seen." It is not our intention to write a work in defence of
                  the peculiar institution<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC6692-00000009"/> of the South;
                  but in delineating pictures of southern life, where the negro character occupies
                  so conspicuous a place, and exercises so commanding an influence, we would draw
                  from nature alone; we would not add one "shade the more, one ray the less," to
                  purchase an immortality of fame. Truth alone is our object, and truth is
                     <emph>omnipotent,</emph> and must and will prevail. We do not enter into the
                  bold design of going back to the time when our forefathers forfeited their claim
                  to humanity, and purchased human blood. Neither do we dare sacrilegiously to
                  question the wisdom of the Creator, nor attempt to fathom the mystery of His
                  design in dyeing the negro's face with the hue of night, and giving to us the
                  fairer tints of the morning. We speak of the children of those forefathers, who
                  have received the inheritance as a part of their patrimony, and on whom the evil
                  is entailed as a birthright. Slavery is not an outer garment, that can be thrown
                  off at will, when it becomes oppressive to the wearer; it is a
                     <emph>thread,</emph> woven into the woof and warp of the web of their
                  existence; and the stroke that separates it must cut the heartstrings of the
                  owner. It is a dark thread; but as it winds along, it gleams with bright and
                  silvery lustre, and some of the most beautiful lights and shades of the texture
                  are owing to the blending of these sable filaments. We hope this digression will
                  be pardoned, and its motive be understood. In these times of national excitement,
                  when the stars of the Union, that have so long moved harmoniously in their
                  appointed orbits, obeying the great laws of moral gravitation, seem ready to rush
                  from their spheres,—and the azure firmament where the constellation has blazed,
                  torn by dissension and scorched by the fires of passion, threatened to be rolled
                  together as a scroll,—it becomes one and all to cast their mite in the treasury of
                  truth. If they have but <emph>one</emph> ray of intellect, let it be sent abroad
                  to assist in dissipating the clouds of error. If they have but an infant's
                  strength, let it be exerted to sustain the endangered interests of our country's
                  union. Should we be accused of throwing too strong a light on our subject, let
                  others bring forward the shade. We again repeat, we will produce no facts
                  connected with this theme for which we cannot bring proofs "strong as Holy Writ."
                  We hope Aunt Milly will forgive us for leaving her standing so long, with her
                  hands folded over her clean, white apron, as on a comfortable little shelf,
                  curtsying to the strange lady with respectful lowliness. A handkerchief of mingled
                  orange and red was twisted round her retreating forehead, and another of the same
                  blending hues was folded round her ebon neck. She had evidently prepared herself
                  for the occasion, and looked as if she were conscious of bearing on her shoulders
                  the tottering honours of the house of Warland. It must be acknowledged that Aunt
                  Milly had one fault, that grew into a kind of monomania. In her desire to conceal
                  the poverty to which her master was reduced, she indulged in a spirit of
                  exaggeration, which increased upon her unconsciously. She actually began to
                  believe <emph>herself</emph> in the existence of those resources which her
                  imagination supplied, she had so often had recourse to them in the day of
                  trouble.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy felt nearly as much surprise to see this very respectable and
                  stately-looking negro a member of the family, as the fair-haired boy she admired
                  so much, and acknowledged her lowly greeting with a gentle curtsy, that took
                  captive at once Aunt Milly's susceptible heart. The black girl, who was sitting on
                  the soft blankets at her mistress's feet, looked up, with a bright exhibition of
                  smiling ivory, on this noble manifestation of one of her own colour.</p>
               <p>"What would mistress like for her supper?" asked Aunt Milly, rolling up her large
                  eyeballs, as if endeavouring to recollect the many luxuries with which she could
                  supply her. "The chickens would be too tough killed off all of a sudden so, or I
                  could have some fried in batter, and there wouldn't be time for the muffins and
                  egg-cake to rise; but e'enemost any thing else in the world that mistress would
                  like, she shall<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC6692-00000010"/> have, for the wanting. I
                  haven't been head-cook in master's family these twelve years for nothing."</p>
               <p>An arch smile fluttered over the rosy lips of Marcus at Aunt Milly's grandiloquent
                  exhibition of hospitality, knowing what a poor supper she really would be obliged
                  to prepare for the appetite of the travellers.</p>
               <p>"Thank you," replied Mrs. Bellamy, "I will not trouble you for any thing but a cup
                  of tea; we all have eaten quite lately in the carriage, and are not hungry in the
                  least. You know travellers always carry their luncheons with them."</p>
               <p>"Yes, mistress; bless your soul, yes," answered Aunt Milly, inexpressibly
                  relieved; "when my poor dear mistress used to go a journeying, I allos stuffed the
                  carriage-pockets full of all sorter nice goodies, to say nothing about the wine
                  and cordials, and them kinder fixings. A bit of cold turkey and a slice of neat's
                  tongue tastes mighty good when one's travelling; I knows all about it. Well, I'll
                  go and draw a cup of gunpowder tea, and serve it up for you, mistress, with loaf
                  sugar and cream."</p>
               <p>It was not long before Aunt Milly reappeared with a waiter, from which the japan
                  had partially disappeared, a cup of common white crockery, and a little blue bowl
                  with brown sugar, instead of the white crystal she had promised to serve. Going up
                  to Mrs. Bellamy with as much ceremony as if she were in a fashionable
                  drawing-room, she apologized for every deficiency with a grace and readiness that
                  left no room for doubt.</p>
               <p>"I'm mighty sorry, mistress, and ashamed, too, to offer you this sort of sugar;
                  but we've just this minute got out of the white. If you'd come any other day but
                  this—it's really mortifying—and this common crockery aint fit for quality folks to
                  use. But you know, mistress, when folks move, chiny and porceling breaks up so, it
                  all turns to rack and ruin. We sold it all out, and the glass and silver too; and
                  this is such a sorter out-of-the-way place, and one see so little fine company, we
                  don't mind about the 'ficiencies."</p>
               <p>"Milly has mounted her hobby-horse, I see," said Mr. Warland, observing Mr.
                  Bellamy and his wife exchange a benevolent smile while his <emph>head-cook</emph>
                  was expatiating over her cup of black tea and brown sugar; "I must, however, do
                  her the justice to say, that whatever may be her present position, she once was
                  familiar with the luxuries of which she boasts."</p>
               <p>"La, please, master," said Milly, casting a cunning look out of the corner of her
                  eye, "I never boasts of myself, but I allos was proud of belonging to quality
                  folks, and not to the no-account sort of people."</p>
               <p>"Well; take away the waiter; don't you see the lady has put her cup back?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy tried to sip the beverage, so kindly prepared, but her utmost efforts
                  only enabled her to get down a few swallows. Aunt Milly was distressed because
                  "the cat had stolen the nice cream, that would have made it so good," and she was
                  equally distressed "that the beautiful Meosselles counterpane was in the wash, and
                  that the lady would have to sleep under that rough kivering."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy assured her on that point, that it was of no consequence, as she only
                  wished to recline on the outside of the bed, wrapped in her shawls, and be ready
                  for a very early ride in the morning.</p>
               <p>"But who is that little creature in the other bed?" said she, starting, for she
                  had not observed before that it had an occupant. Now the firelight played
                  lambently on little Katy's round, but colourless cheeks and dark hair, which lay
                  loose upon the pillow.</p>
               <p>"La, bless your heart, mistress, that's little Katy; it's my own blessed child,
                  that I weaned and took right out of its mother's arms. And so I did young master,
                  there; and since their own mother died, my poor, dear mistress, I haint lived for
                  any thing else in the world but them children, and<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000011"/> I shall live for them, till the Lord pleases to
                  take me home to my blessed husband, that's now in glory; the Lord have mercy on
                  his soul."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy was so much interested in the sleeping child that she walked across
                  the room, and gazed on its infantine features, to the delight of the affectionate
                  Milly.</p>
               <p>"Oh! mistress," continued she, in the abundance of her affection, "them children's
                  mighty near to me; if they were my own born and raised, I couldn't think more of
                  'em. When my Heavenly Master saw fit to take away my poor mistress from evil to
                  come, she make me promise 'fore she die, never to leave or 'sake her little ones;
                  and I never will, as long as one foot can trot after the other. No; as long as
                  poor Milly has a mouthful of hoe-cake as big as a barley-corn," added she,
                  forgetting her vain boasting in the pure reality of her affection, "she'll break
                  it with them two blessed children."</p>
               <p>Wiping a tear from her eye with the corner of her white starched apron, she
                  stroked back the child's dishevelled hair, and smoothed the sheet carefully over
                  the counterpane.</p>
               <p>"They are both beautiful children," replied Mrs. Bellamy, looking from the placid
                  face of the sleeper to the little ferryman near the fire. "How long is it since
                  their mother died?"</p>
               <p>"Just two years and six months next Sabbath evening at half-past eleven o'clock;"
                  then lowering her voice so that her master and Mr. Bellamy, who were engaged in
                  earnest conversation, could not hear her, "that was an awful night, it was; I
                  never shall forget it in all my born days. I thought master would have gone
                  'stracted sure enough; he went raving about the room, and bunting his head 'gin
                  every thing that come in his way, as if he wanted to split it right open; if it
                  hadn't been for that trouble, he never'd seen this sorter place. We couldn't stay
                  there no more, so he sold every negro he had but me, and come off like St.
                  Bartholomew in the wilderness, to live, as it were, on the locusses and wild
                  honey."</p>
               <p>The lady, though she was much interested in the history of the orphan children,
                  and touched by the devotion of the faithful slave, felt very weary and anxious to
                  resume her reclining position. The coloured girl was already fast asleep; and
                  Marcus, wrapping himself in a blanket that Aunt Milly brought from the kitchen,
                  soon slept as soundly as if lying on a bed of down. Mrs. Bellamy, overcome by
                  fatigue, suffered her head to fall entirely back on the pillow, whose clean
                  surface she did not shrink from pressing, and she also soon lost all consciousness
                  of surrounding objects. Aunt Milly retired to the kitchen, rejoicing that she had
                  not been obliged to commit the honour of the family, by getting a supper, which
                  would have shamed her cookery and the former grandeur of their house. All slept
                  but Mr. Bellamy and his host, who sat smoking their pipes and conversing with
                  earnest interest by the light-wood blaze. Let it not be a matter of surprise that
                  a gentleman of the fine appearance and elegant accompaniments of Mr. Bellamy
                  should indulge in the luxury of a pipe. It is the badge of the southern planter,
                  however lofty his rank, or abounding his wealth. When the shades of evening gather
                  round him, and he draws near the genial hearth, he applies the live coal to the
                  cup of his earthen pipe, and while the blue smoke curls in light wreaths above his
                  head, filling the room with a warm and fragrant atmosphere, he luxuriates in the
                     <foreign xml:lang="ITA">dolce far niente</foreign> of existence. Or when a
                  warmer season sends him abroad in the open air, he seats himself in the pillared
                  piazza that surrounds his dwelling, and looking benevolently and placidly at the
                  winking stars, he watches the gossamer-like vapour float among the tendrils of the
                  vines that twine the column which supports his leaning chair. In the north, it is
                  only the country labourer that cultivates this soothing art, and the farmer's wife
                  who possesses any claim to gentle breeding would blush to have her husband seen
                  with this calumet of peace at his lips. The highbred southerner, like the calm,
                  luxurious German, loves to see<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6692-00000012"/> the cares
                  of the day evaporate with the incense of the weed, whose cultivation is a source
                  of his wealth, and furnishes employment to a portion of his slaves.</p>
               <p>"I am astonished," said Mr. Bellamy, continuing the conversation, now audible in
                  the stillness of the apartment, "I am astonished that a man of your natural and
                  cultivated powers of mind can settle down in this obscure spot, lost to mankind
                  and lost to himself. Pardon me if I speak too plainly, but I cannot help it. A man
                  is never lost while conscious of his degenerate condition. If not for your own
                  sake, for the sake of your children, rouse yourself and be a man again. Why, this
                  boy of yours is the finest child I ever saw in my life. To put <emph>him</emph> in
                  a ferry-boat, and throw all his energies into that long pole he grasps with such a
                  princely air, when by education he might be made such an ornament to the world, is
                  a crime in the sight of God and man."</p>
               <p>"Alas! what else can I do with him now? I have wasted the property that might have
                  been his. I have forfeited the confidence and respect of society. I have made
                  myself a byword and a reproach among men. I came here that I might hide myself
                  from every eye that knew me in the days that were mine, before the tempter found
                  this burning plague-spot in my heart, and blew upon it with his breath of
                  flame."</p>
               <p>"You have but to make a solemn resolution never to taste another drop of the
                  poison;—to do as thousands have done before you, and been saved," cried Mr.
                  Bellamy, rapping the ashes from his pipe in an energetic manner. "You are still in
                  the prime and vigour of your days. You can resume your station in society. You can
                  give your children the blessings of civilized and social life."</p>
               <p>"Look at this tremulous hand," said Mr. Warland, holding up the half-palsied
                  member, "and see what a wreck my nervous system now is. I might have reformed
                  years ago, but now it is too late. Every energy of body and mind is fast wasting
                  away. I cannot live without the excitement of drink. I must drink to appease the
                  gnawing of remorse—to drown the scorpions of avenging conscience:—drink to forget
                  that I broke the heart of my wife, beggared my children, sold and scattered my
                  poor slaves:—drink to forget that I have sold myself, body and soul, to the
                  arch-tempter of mankind."</p>
               <p>"Well, drink as much as you please, but let it be cold water—pure, crystal water
                  from the spring. Promise me, if you have one remnant of manhood left, that you
                  will not taste another drop of alcohol. If you will, I will do something for that
                  boy of yours. If I had such a son, I would not take a million ingots of gold for
                  him. He <emph>must</emph> be educated. How you can sit down and give yourself up
                  to perdition, without one spark of pride for your children, or one feeling of
                  respect for yourself, is astonishing—astounding—incomprehensible. By heaven, the
                  maniac, chained to his dungeon walls, is a sane man to you!"</p>
               <p>"I know it—I feel it," cried the wretched man, "but I've made so many resolutions
                  and broken them all, I'm afraid to promise. I have tried—God knows I have—but it
                  is all in vain. You think I don't love my children. I would throw myself into
                  these flames this moment if it would do them any good. I would be torn into atoms
                  by wild beasts to save them one pang. And yet"——</p>
               <p>"You cannot give up the suicidal habit of drinking," interrupted Mr. Bellamy.</p>
               <p>"Alas! no—some demon stands at my elbow and urges me on, though I know that every
                  step brings me nearer to the burning billows of hell."</p>
               <p>Here he leaned his head on his hand, and wept and sobbed in the impotence of
                  unavailing remorse.</p>
               <p>"God help you, poor man, and God help your poor children," exclaimed Mr. Bellamy,
                  too much moved to remain still in his chair, and rising, he walked the room with
                  troubled steps.</p>
               <p>His heart yearned over the sleeping children, doomed to an orphanage more sad than
                  that created by death itself. It<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC6692-00000013"/> yearned
                  too over the helpless man, who seemed wrapped in the tightening coils of a hydra,
                  whose blood is gall, and whose breath is fire. He stopped at the side of the
                  slumbering boy, on whose placid brow a heaven-born smile was lingering, as if it
                  had been fanned by an angel's wing. "And this boy must live under this doom,"
                  cried he, bitterly. "Oh! miserable infatuation—unparalleled madness!"</p>
               <p>"I <emph>will</emph> try once more," cried the weeping inebriate. "I
                     <emph>will</emph> try for the sake of that boy and my poor, little, motherless
                  Katy. I thank you for the interest you have taken in a doomed wretch. If I had
                  known you a little sooner, I might perhaps have been saved. But friends looked
                  coldly on me, neighbours passed by me on the other side—even my wife turned from
                  me in loathing. Poor soul, she could not help it—no, she could not. I thought I
                  was lost, and plunged deeper and deeper, trying to annihilate myself. But there is
                  something <emph>here</emph> that is undying," cried he, smiting his breast with
                  his hand. "There is a fire that is unquenchable. The word of God is true. Yea, let
                  God be true, though every man be a liar."</p>
               <p>"I shall be travelling this way again in about six months," said Mr. Bellamy,
                  trying to speak calmly. "In the mean time, abstain from the poison that is
                  consuming you, and if I then find you are trying to help yourself and family, I
                  will see what I can do for you. I will get a respectable situation for yourself,
                  and assist in the education of your children. But remember, it must be a
                     <emph>sober</emph> man that I place in a responsible office. I cannot
                  compromise my own reputation."</p>
               <p>Mr. Warland renewed the oft-repeated and oft-broken promise of abstinence, with an
                  earnest resolution of amendment; and Mr. Bellamy, gratified at obtaining this
                  victory, and hoping he would have strength to keep his word inviolate, lay down on
                  the couch, and fell into the calm slumbers of an untroubled bosom. Mr. Warland
                  could not sleep. The stings of an awakened conscience and the terrible gnawings of
                  unsatisfied satisfied appetite would not let him rest. Crouching by the hearth, he
                  gazed on the little cupboard which contained the fluid that had turned his blood
                  to fire, and for which he was craving with insane, irresistible desire; then
                  looking on the calm sleepers, he said to himself,—he might taste, and they would
                  never know. His bold boy would not dash the glass again from his grasping hand;
                  his new friend's admonishing voice was silent now. Stealing darkly towards the
                  corner, he opened the door, and laid his hand upon the bottle.</p>
               <p>"I have promised," he said, pausing and trembling, "the breath is not yet dry upon
                  my lips—I have promised once again, and shall I break my oath this very night—this
                  hour—this moment? Oh! merciful Father!" he exclaimed, sinking on his knees, and
                  holding up his trembling arms towards heaven, "Holy Spirit, whom I have insulted
                  and abjured, forsake me not in this my extremity. Give me strength to wrestle with
                  my indwelling sin. Take away the curse from me and my children."</p>
               <p>Jacob wrestled with the angel of his dream till the breaking day, and won the
                  blessing for which he fought. Warland struggled with the demon of temptation till
                  morning light, and at last prevailed. How many more conflicts could he endure, and
                  live?</p>
               <p>Before the rising of the sun, all was life and bustle in the cabin. The travellers
                  were anxious to commence their journey at the earliest possible hour, and Aunt
                  Milly, finding that they were resolved to start before breakfast, and thus knowing
                  that the <emph>credit</emph> of the family was safe, gave a glowing description of
                  the luxuries that she had <emph>intended</emph> to place before them.</p>
               <p>Little Katy gazed with surprise and alarm on the strange faces that met her waking
                  eyes; but there was something so kind and reassuring in their countenances, she
                  soon glided to the side of the lady, and even played with the rings that glittered
                  on her snowy fingers. Mrs. Bellamy, who had no<pb n="28-29"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000014"/> children of her own, felt inexpressible tenderness
                  for this motherless child, confided to the care of an evidently inebriate father,
                  and a slave who, however faithful and affectionate, was incapacitated, by her
                  darkened intellect, from bestowing that moral and mental culture her dawning years
                  demanded. There was something peculiar in the face of Katy—peculiar for a child in
                  any situation, but especially in hers. A pensive, even melancholy, expression, and
                  a total absence of colour gave her a look of refinement, more interesting than
                  mere rosy, joyous beauty. Her eyes were blue, of a darker hue than her brother's,
                  but their lashes were of raven blackness, and her eyebrows and hair were
                  exceedingly dark. Aunt Milly had arrayed her in her best frock and apron, and
                  brushed her hair till it looked glossy as the wing of a bird: and when a child
                  feels that she has her <emph>best</emph> dress on, no matter what that dress may
                  be, whether the costliest silk or the cheapest calico, the association is the
                  same, and all the self-respect which external circumstances can give her elevates
                  her spirits. It was this consciousness of looking her best, that gave her
                  confidence to caress Mrs. Bellamy's gem-decorated hand, and peep into her pale
                  face with those eyes, that resembled the violet in colour and their natural
                  bending towards the earth.</p>
               <p>"You are a very sweet little girl," said the kind-hearted lady, putting her arm
                  caressingly round her. "Whom do you love best?"</p>
               <p>"Marcus and Aunt Milly, and father, too," answered the child.</p>
               <p>"Marcus is very kind to you, is he not? He is a good brother, I know."</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, ma'am," replied Katy, with a fervour that changed the whole expression
                  of her features; "he is <emph>so</emph> good!—you don't <emph>know</emph> how good
                  he is. He saves all the money he gets, and puts it in a little box with a hole in
                  the top, where it can't come out again, for me, when I get big enough to go to
                  school. I can read now; he taught me how himself, and reads books to me every
                  night."</p>
               <p>"Does <emph>he</emph> go to school, my child?"</p>
               <p>"No, ma'am; but father teaches him. Father is a great scholar, and knows every
                  thing. Brother Marcus can read Latin and Greek, too, and father says he will be a
                  great man some time."</p>
               <p>"But how does your brother earn money?" asked the lady, urged by a better motive
                  than idle curiosity. They happened to be alone in the room at this moment, as all
                  were busy in preparation for their departure.</p>
               <p>"He catches fish, and sells them; and sometimes the gentlemen that cross in the
                  boat give him money; and he makes little willow baskets at night, and Aunt Milly
                  carries them way off and sells them for him. But you mustn't tell of that, please
                  don't," added the child, lowering her voice. "He don't want it known, 'cause he
                  says it's girl-work. I help him make them, too. Aunt Milly keeps the box for us,
                  and puts a heap in it herself."</p>
               <p>"And how does <emph>she</emph> earn money in a place like this, and what is she
                  going to do with it? Help send you to school?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ma'am, that's what she does it for. She takes in washing and sewing; all she
                  can get, though that aint much; we live so far off. Uncle Simon brings work to
                  her."</p>
               <p>"And who is Uncle Simon?"</p>
               <p>"Don't you know Uncle Simon?" asked the child in an accent of astonishment. "He
                  comes to see Aunt Milly, and he's so good. He's lame, and goes with a crutch; and
                  he's old, too; and his master don't make him do much, but he does a heap for us,
                  for all that."</p>
               <p>"But your father, my dear child, your father puts money in your little box, too,
                  does he not?"</p>
               <p>"Father never has any money to put anywhere," replied little Katy, a shade of
                  inexpressible melancholy stealing over her sweet countenance. "<emph>He</emph>
                  spends it right off."</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6692-00000015"/>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy felt that she had arrived at a point where it would be sacrilege to
                  go farther. The vices of a parent must be sacred ground to an innocent child, and
                  never invaded by others, in their presence; but she knew little Katy must be aware
                  of the appropriation of her father's money, and that, young as she was, she
                  mourned over his degradation, and its awful consequences.</p>
               <p>"I love father, because he loves <emph>me,</emph>" said the child, fearful Mrs.
                  Bellamy would think ill of him, because she had said he put no money in her little
                  hoard.</p>
               <p>"Will you tell your brother to come and see me a few moments before I go? I want
                  to speak with him."</p>
               <p>Away Katy flew, and soon returned, holding Marcus by the hand, whose face
                  reflected the radiance of the rising day. He stood before her, his cap in his
                  hand, and a modest blush glowing on his cheek.</p>
               <p>"You were so very kind and considerate as to give up your bed and sleep on the
                  hard floor," said Mrs. Bellamy, "I owe you some return; what can I do for
                  you?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, ma'am. I am sure, I hope you don't think I did it in the thought of
                  being paid. Besides, it's father's bed, not mine. If anybody is to be thanked,
                  it's he, not I, ma'am."</p>
               <p>It was very strange, but this rich and high-bred lady felt embarrassed at the
                  thought of offering money to the son of the poor ferryman. She felt afraid of
                  offending that innate nobility of soul, which gave such intelligence and spirit to
                  his whole countenance. She had drawn an eagle from her purse, but hesitated in
                  what manner to present it. At length she said, while a slight colour mantled her
                  delicate cheek,—</p>
               <p>"Your little sister tells me that you are very good to her, and are saving all
                  your money for her use. Will you add this to her little store, and remember too
                  that you have friends now who will always feel interested in your welfare?"</p>
               <p>"Thank you, ma'am," said Marcus, receiving the golden coin with a bright blush,
                  and bowing low as he took it from that beautiful jewelled hand. "You have given it
                  to <emph>her,</emph> and I must not refuse it. But we've done nothing to deserve
                  it. It is all your gift, and a generous one, I'm sure."</p>
               <p>"Don't you desire to go to school yourself?" asked Mrs. Bellamy. "You will not be
                  contented to stay here and row a ferry-boat much longer. You ought not to be. You
                  were made for something better. Have you no relations that can assist you?"</p>
               <p>"Not that I know, ma'am. I do desire to go to school. I feel as if I
                     <emph>should</emph> some day, but I could not leave my father now. He could not
                  get along without me. He instructs me, too, when he is well enough." He paused
                  with painful confusion, and then continued: "My father is an educated man, and
                  takes great delight in giving me lessons when he has time. He has a good many
                  books, which I love to read. See here, ma'am," said he, drawing aside a little
                  calico curtain over the fireplace, and exhibiting several rows of classic volumes.
                  "These are my treasures. We had a large library once, but these are all that are
                  left. Contented!" repeated he, his lips curling with that peculiar curve she had
                  admired so much the night before. "Oh! no, ma'am—don't think I am contented
                  here."</p>
               <p>"You ought not to be," said the lady, rising and folding her shawl more closely
                  round her, for she heard the rumbling of the carriage wheels approaching the door.
                  "You must think of me sometimes, and remember what I have said to you."</p>
               <p>"Think of you!" exclaimed the boy, with fervid, enthusiastic gratitude. "Oh!
                  madam, how could I ever forget you?"</p>
               <p>The gentleness, kindness, and condescension of this beautiful lady opened a fount
                  of sensibility in the young heart of Marcus that was never again sealed. She
                  appeared in that rude cabin like an angel visitant, a messenger of mercy, bearing
                  tidings from a fairer, purer world. He felt that <emph>he</emph> was of a kindred
                  nature, that it was for such fellowship he was created, and he made a vow to
                  himself that he would prove<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6692-00000016"/> worthy of the
                  interest he had excited in her. He would strive, and toil, and struggle as never
                  boy yet toiled and struggled, with an opposing destiny, till he had won back that
                  position in society his father had forfeited; and perhaps, when his arm had the
                  strength and his spirit the power of manhood, this fair, rich, and beautiful woman
                  might possibly need <emph>his</emph> protection and aid. She might be riding in
                  the darkness of night, and her carriage hurried to the brink of a precipice, and
                  he rush forward and arrest the plunging horses; or she might be attacked by
                  robbers, and his protecting arm shield her from their rapacity and rage. All this
                  flashed through the brain of the high-reaching boy, and gave extraordinary
                  animation to his countenance. The lady kissed the round cheek of Katy, and held
                  out her hand to the boy in token of farewell; then yielding to an irresistible
                  impulse, she bent down and kissed his forehead. Marcus felt as if his mother had
                  come down from heaven, and breathed her balmy breath upon his brow. The grace, the
                  tenderness of the action swelled his very soul. It was so long since he had felt
                  such a dear caress. It hallowed him; it set him apart as something holy; it filled
                  him with divine aspirations. Tears gushed like a fountain from his eyes, and,
                  ashamed of his weakness, he darted through a back-door, and plunged into the
                  thicket of pine trees that sheltered the cabin. Mrs. Bellamy turned to the
                  opposite door with glistening eyes, where she encountered Aunt Milly, who had come
                  to take an elaborate farewell.</p>
               <p>She pressed in her hand a generous token of remembrance, which the negro, in her
                  honest pride, was ashamed to receive.</p>
               <p>"Oh! mistress, it's a shame, I'm sure, to take so much for just nothing at all. If
                  it had been any other time, I could have served you up something nice and
                  delicate. If you'd stayed to breakfast, and let me make some fricasee or quality
                  dish for you, 'twould been different. Then the bed-kiver—was so ashamed—all the
                  nice linen just washed and wrenched. But you'll 'scuse it, mistress, I know you
                  will, for you are a raal born lady, every inch of you; and the Lord bless and
                  presarve you, and give you and good master too a merciful deliverance to your
                  journey's end. May goodness and marcy follow you all the days of your life, and
                  may you live herearter in the big house the preachers built up yonder, without any
                  hands or tools—etarnal in the heavens."</p>
               <p>Aunt Milly had a habit of winding up her best speeches with quotations from
                  Scripture, for the sake of effect, and though they were sometimes rather obscure,
                  and perverted from their original meaning, they were not without point or
                  expression.</p>
               <p>"I respect you for your kindness to those children," said the lady, with a sweet
                  smile. "Continue to be as kind and good to them, and God will reward you, Aunt
                  Milly."</p>
               <p>"Oh! mistress, you are so good—bless your sweet face. You look just like the seven
                  seraphims that were cast out of the blessed Mary Magdalen—just like the sweet
                  angel, that you are. I try to do my duty to them children, the Lord knows. It's
                  all I lives and prays for."</p>
               <p>Aunt Milly was now sobbing outright in the corner of her apron, for Mrs. Bellamy
                  had touched the soft, porous part of her heart, that was always saturated with
                  tears, which oozed out at the slightest pressure.</p>
               <p>"Isabel, my dear," said Mr. Bellamy, taking her hand to lead her to the carriage,
                  "we are all ready; the horses seem very gentle, so do not be alarmed."</p>
               <p>"I do not fear by daylight, when you are near me," replied she, taking her seat on
                  the crimson cushions that were gathered from all parts of the carriage around her.
                  Mr. Bellamy shook hands with Mr. Warland, with whom he had just held another long
                  and interesting conversation, and with a hearty "God bless you," took his place by
                  the side of his wife.</p>
               <p>"I feel quite out of my province in a carriage," said Mr. Bellamy, trying to
                  settle himself in the midst of the bundles and carpet-bags, and the feet of the
                  black girl on the opposite<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6692-00000017"/> seat. "Give me
                  the back of the horse and the open air; but my wife <emph>would</emph> have my
                  company, and I was obliged to obey. Drive on, Jerry, and remember whom you are
                  carrying."</p>
               <p>The carriage rolled along. Mr. Warland stood rooted to the spot where they left,
                  all the remnant goodness of his nature roused to action by coming into collision
                  with one so noble and generous. Aunt Milly gazed after them from the threshold
                  with as much reverence as Abraham did after the departing angels who had sojourned
                  in his tent; while little Katy raised herself on tiptoe to catch one more glimpse
                  of the glittering wheels. But none gazed with the same intense feelings as swelled
                  the heart of the boy who had sought the deep pine grove to hide his gushing tears.
                  The child even then had a revelation of his destiny as a man. He believed that God
                  had something great in store for him, and he was right.</p>

               <p>IT was the beginning of winter when the travellers stopped at the ferryman's
                  cabin, and long after their departure a wake of brightness seemed reflected on the
                  stream of his existence. He had been strengthened to keep the solemn promise by
                  which he had bound himself, and he already walked with a firmer tread and more
                  elevated bearing. At night, by the blaze of the pine-wood knot, he sat down by the
                  hearth-side, while Marcus conned his classic lessons, or read the historic page,
                  and Katy, cradled in his arms, seemed to infuse into his heart the purity and
                  tranquillity of her own. The shout of the traveller was often heard, borne across
                  the river by the breeze of night, but no one like the generous Bellamy and his
                  sweet-faced wife came to gladden their dwelling.</p>
               <p>"He said he would return in about six months," said he to himself, while
                  apparently absorbed in the contents of a book. "More than two have already passed.
                  Shall I hold out to the end, and be saved? Yes!—if there is truth or strength in
                  human resolution, I will. I feel like a regenerated being. I can meet the clear
                  glance of my boy without quailing. I can press the rosy lips of my darling without
                  fear of scorching them with my fiery breath. I can look up to heaven, and ask the
                  blessing of my God, confident that I am in the path of duty, and that His hand
                  will guide me, and His rod sustain me. Yes! I feel there is hope even for me."</p>
               <p>Marcus studied with an enthusiasm he had never manifested before. The words of the
                  beautiful lady were ever thrilling his memory and inciting him to new exertions.
                  Then, his father's regeneration, with what joy and gratitude did it inspire him!
                  It is true, he had abstained before, and again relapsed; but it seemed impossible
                  now that he ever would sink again into the abyss of shame from which he had
                  emerged. Never since he had dwelt in that little cabin, had he felt so happy in
                  the present, so hopeful of the future. A new source of enjoyment was also opened
                  to him. As a reward for his extraordinary progress in the classics, his father had
                  allowed him to commence the reading of Shakspeare, which was one of the rich gems
                  saved from the general wreck. The boy felt as if he were in the midst of the
                  glories of a new creation. It seemed to him that he was an instrument with ten
                  thousand keys which the mighty Master of the human heart was touching at his will,
                  waking the thundering notes of passion or the mellow<pb n="36-37"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000018"/> strains of tenderness and love. Boy as he was, he
                  felt he knew them all; and in every lovely heroine he traced a similitude to his
                  beautiful benefactress. He thought not, or cared not, that she was older than
                  these divine ideals. He clothed the young and impassioned Juliet with her pale and
                  spiritual loveliness; the tender Cordelia with her matchless grace; and in
                  imagination the gentle Desdemona spoke in her silver accents. Little did Mrs.
                  Bellamy imagine the deep worship she had inspired, the romantic reverential
                  devotion pledged to her cause by this youthful devotee. She was henceforth to him
                  the Star of the East, that was to lead him onward to glory and happiness. But
                  Marcus had too much to accomplish, too great an object before him, to indulge too
                  long in these ideal pleasures, whatever their fascinations might be. He would
                  start up with a desperate resolution, shut the book, run into the kitchen where
                  Uncle Simon and Aunt Milly were chatting cosily together, and seizing the bundle
                  of osiers Uncle Simon was sure to have ready for him, would either sit down a
                  while by these two faithful friends, while his fingers wove the smooth, white
                  withes together, or return to the cabin, and snatching up his book, lay it open on
                  the table, glancing furtively at the page, and taking in a glimpse of poetic
                  beauty, while he braided the flexible willows, and shaped the growing basket. As
                  Katy had told Mrs. Bellamy, he did not like to have it known that he employed
                  himself in this manner, because he thought it an unmanly occupation; but as Aunt
                  Milly disposed of them for him, he was not ashamed of working at home in this
                  manner for the holy purpose for which he intended to devote his gains. Uncle
                  Simon, the lame negro, whom Katy held in such veneration, was a constant visitor
                  at the cabin, and vied with Milly in devotion to these interesting little
                  children. He was nearly an exempt in consequence of his age and lameness, and had
                  the greatest part of his time at his own disposal. Aunt Milly washed and mended
                  his clothes for him, and, in return, he was always bringing some acceptable
                  offering to her and the children. Milly was never weary of describing to him the
                  ancient honours of their house, and he, considered quite an oracle in his tribe,
                  gave her long lessons of morality, and explained the Scriptures with unwearied
                  zeal. They were neither of them idle while enjoying these social pleasures. She
                  plied the needle as if her life depended upon her completing her task, and he
                  either braided mats, made brooms by peeling down the smooth oak or hickory sticks,
                  or prepared the osiers for "blessed young master."</p>
               <p>Simon's hair was all grizzled, and it crisped round his black, wrinkled face,
                  making a gray shade, like a crown of ashes on a lump of shining charcoal. The
                  white of his eyes had a yellow tinge, and a sallow hue had also stolen over the
                  once dazzling ivory of his teeth. He was naturally tall and broad-shouldered, but
                  in consequence of his lameness was drawn on one side, and the muscles on one side
                  of his neck were considerably contracted. He took great pains with his dress when
                  he came to see Aunt Milly, who kept his shirts as white as the unsunned snow. On
                  Sundays he wore an obsolete uniform coat, which had been given him years ago by
                  his old master, who was a militia colonel. Then, the military grandeur of his
                  attire, united with his crutch, gave him a similitude to a faded warrior; but all
                  the battles he ever fought were in the church militant, of which he was the most
                  celebrated champion of all his tribe who dwelt near the eastern shores of the
                  rushing Chattahoochee.</p>
               <p>"Now, young master," said Simon, when Marcus, with his soul still echoing to the
                  sounding strains of the bard of Avon, was flying out of the kitchen, with his arms
                  entwined with osiers; "please set down and talk a little to old Simon. That's
                  right—that's a cleber master. Milly and I have been a argufying Scripter, and she
                  says it's one thing, and I says another. We wants you to set us right. I oughts to
                  know best, since I've been a preacher, as I may say, sence I could tell a sweet
                  potater from a cabbage-stalk; but never mind, the<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000019"/> wimmen allers thinks <emph>they</emph> knows best,
                  master Marcus; you'll find that out bimeby—yah, yah."</p>
               <p>When Simon laughed, Milly always laughed too, out of politeness; and this was a
                  great charm in her manners, in his estimation.</p>
               <p>"You have not told me the question, Uncle Simon. How can I tell which is right,
                  till I know the subject of dispute?"</p>
               <p>"Now this it is, young master. Please listen, while I puts down the argument. I
                  haven't been preaching all this time for nothing. Now <emph>I</emph> says that
                  Abram offered up Isaac. You know Abram was a mighty great parsonage, and the Lord
                  used to come and talk with him just as I talks to you, sorter familiar like. Now
                  the Lord, says he to Abram, 'You go and take Isaac'—<emph>Isaac,</emph> mark ye,
                  master—'and go right up to Maria'—(I allers did think that a mighty strange way to
                  call a mountain)—'and pick up a heap of wood as you go along, and make a
                  burnt-off'ring of the boy.' Now Milly, says she, it was <emph>Isaac</emph> that
                  had to burn up Abram; and when I tells her it's no sich thing, she says it makes
                  no difference, no way—it's just as the Lord pleases."</p>
               <p>"Well, what difference upon airth does it make?" said Aunt Milly, giving a
                  triumphant wink to Marcus. "Here is a hoe-cake, isn't there?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to be sure there is."</p>
               <p>"Well, if <emph>you</emph> eats it, it's gone—and if <emph>I</emph> eats it, it's
                  gone. It makes no sort of difference—it's gone, any way. Now I want to know if it
                  isn't jist the same about Abram and Isaac. If Abram offered up Isaac, he was gone;
                  and if Isaac burnt up Abram, he was gone. It's just as the Lord pleased."</p>
               <p>And Aunt Milly nodded her head, and drew out a long needle of thread, as if her
                  argument were overwhelming and unanswerable.</p>
               <p>"I will get my Bible, Aunt Milly, and read you the history of Abraham and Isaac,
                  and then you will see which was right."</p>
               <p>Marcus brought his Bible, and sitting down between the two sable disputants, like
                  the moonbeam severing a midnight cloud, he read, with a clear, melodious voice,
                  the beautiful story of the commanded sacrifice and the angelic interposition.
                  Milly dropped her work, and leaned on her right elbow to listen, and Simon laid
                  down his braided shucks and leaned on his left arm towards the youthful reader.
                  The whitish, crispy wool of the old cripple almost touched the glistening locks of
                  Marcus, and both pair of large, dilated eyeballs were drawn to a focus on the
                  boy's beaming countenance.</p>
               <p>"Jist listen—bless his heart—what a preacher he would make!" exclaimed Simon,
                  giving Aunt Milly an emphatic nudge; "and you sees I am right, too—I knew I was.
                  The Lord forgive your pervarseness."</p>
               <p>"I never disputes the good book when I hears it, Simon; and I allows I
                     <emph>was</emph> mistaken this time; but it might have been one as well as
                  t'other, that's all."</p>
               <p>"Now I jist wants to convince you of one thing," continued the persevering Simon,
                  "that it <emph>does</emph> make a heap of difference what person is meant. Suppose
                  I puts my foot in the fire—<emph>you</emph> don't feel it, does you?"</p>
               <p>"No, to be sure I dosn't."</p>
               <p>"Well, if <emph>you</emph> puts yourn in, <emph>I</emph> don't feel it. Then you
                  see that proves the difference; so there's no use of argufying no more."</p>
               <p>"No more there aint, Simon," said Milly, anxious to change the subject, as she was
                  conscious he had won the victory, and exulted in her defeat.</p>
               <p>It may be that the forensic disputations of our sable logicians were as lucid, and
                  their subject as important, as some of our fairer and more learned brethren's. The
                  negro certainly takes great pride in argument, particularly on religious subjects;
                  and intrenching himself behind the bulwark of his faith, he clings to his
                  preconceived opinions with a firmness and pertinacity which in ancient days would
                  have won him the blazing crown of martyrdom. His religion, blended, as it is, with
                  the most intense superstition, sometimes gives a tone of sublimity to his
                  thoughts, in the midst of the most ludicrous<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000020"/> crous associations. He sees the ghost flitting
                  through the midnight shades of the dark pine woods, and hears the wailing of the
                  lost spirit in the notes of the melancholy whippoor-will, and the hooting of the
                  solemn owl. There is an African mythology as well as a Grecian and pagan one, and
                  the negro's night is peopled by shapes which would puzzle the most ingenious
                  statuary to fashion, or the most inventive artist to delineate.</p>
               <p>Winter glided away peacefully and monotonously at the ferryman's cabin, and the
                  gentle, almost imperceptible approach of a southern spring was felt rather than
                  seen. The turbid waters looked clearer and bluer, the holly-trees had a brighter,
                  deeper green, and the music of birds began to vocalize the lonely margin of the
                  waters.</p>
               <p>Mr. Warland, confident in his own strength, looked for the return of Mr. Bellamy
                  with great impatience. He was very weary of his present mode of existence, and
                  panted for a more congenial field of action. He had remained completely
                  domesticated during the winter months, and out of the reach of temptation; for he
                  poured out every drop of alcohol left in his possession, and ground the bottle to
                  powder, that he might annihilate even the home of his enemy.</p>
               <p>There was to be a kind of political meeting, a few miles distant, which he was
                  anxious to attend. Marcus saw the preparations for his departure with foreboding
                  heart. Never had he returned from such a gathering without a reeling step and a
                  cursing lip. It was always the commencement of a long season of inebriation.
                  Marcus longed to warn him of his danger, and entreat him to keep out of the way of
                  temptation and sin. But this would seem such an insult to his father's character,
                  he could not frame the words that trembled on his lips. They were written legibly,
                  however, in his earnest eyes, and Mr. Warland answered as if they had been
                  spoken.</p>
               <p>"Fear not, my son; your father will not disgrace himself again. He has profited by
                  the bitter lessons of experience, and can say to the tempter, with unhesitating
                  voice, 'Avaunt! carry your baffled arts elsewhere.'"</p>
               <p>Marcus tried to smile and shake off the depression that hung heavy on his mind. He
                  was quite a Nimrod in the woods, and taking his gun and pouch, and mounting a pony
                  that Uncle Simon had left for his use, followed by his bounding dog, he soon
                  forgot his sad forebodings in the excitement of hunting. Often had he seen the
                  track of the flying deer; he had even caught a glimpse of their branching antlers
                  through the swaying boughs; but never had he brought the noble animal at bay, or
                  carried home a saddle of venison to the exulting Milly. But this day he actually
                  won the crown of glory. He killed a beautiful deer with his own hand, and bathed
                  his knife in the life-blood of its panting heart. As the victim turned upon him
                  its wild, wistful, dying eyes, ere they closed for ever, the triumphant boy felt a
                  pang of unutterable remorse dart through his heart. The dripping knife fell from
                  his hand, and a mist darkened his vision. He felt that he was a cruel murderer,
                  and would have given the best blood of his own heart to have restored life to the
                  stiffening limbs of the bleeding animal. Then he remembered what a trophy it was,
                  how much money it would add to his slowly increasing store, how Aunt Milly would
                  praise his exploit, and little Katy's blue eyes dance with rapture, when she saw
                  him bearing it homeward, swung in triumph across his pony, its antlers adorned
                  with the holly's shining leaves. All the honours he anticipated awaited his
                  return, and he watched his father's coming with redoubled anxiety, that he might
                  inform him of his unlooked-for achievement.</p>
               <p>"Don't leave your gun here, brother," said little Katy, as he leaned it against
                  the wall in a corner of the cabin, "I'm afraid of it."</p>
               <p>"But you must not touch it, or go near it, and then there is no danger. There is a
                  load in it that I do not wish to waste, as I intend to go out again to-morrow.
                  Aunt Milly, you must have a dish of smoking venison prepared for father's<pb
                     n="42-43" xml:id="VAC6692-00000021"/> supper; we will have one noble meal, and
                  sell the rest, skin and all. I'll keep the antlers, however, to adorn the door of
                  our cabin, and to let people know a descendant of the mighty Assyrian hunter
                  dwells beneath this roof."</p>
               <p>Marcus must be pardoned a little boasting. For a boy of ten the capture of the
                  deer is an <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ultima Thule</foreign> of ambition, and
                  whatever after victories life may offer, no laurels glow with a brighter lustre
                  than those won in the wild green wood.</p>
               <p>"I wish father would come," exclaimed Katy, when the night grew dark, and the
                  children drew near the hearth where the venison exhaled its savoury odours. Though
                  the springtime of the year diffused a mid-day glow, the chill night-air required
                  the warmth of a fire, and the light-wood knot was the only lamp that illumined
                  their dwelling.</p>
               <p>"I wish he would, indeed," cried Marcus, the glow of success fading away in the
                  chill of apprehension. He stood at the door looking, with his hand over his brow,
                  into the thickening shadows.</p>
               <p>"Never mind, young master," said Milly, pitying the hungry Katy, "you can eat your
                  supper, and I'll keep ole master's hot at the fire, and serve it up for him when
                  he come back."</p>
               <p>Katy rejoiced in this arrangement, but Marcus could not eat. A sense of coming
                  evil produced that sickness of the soul, a thousand times more deadly than
                  physical disease. He was as sure that his father would return shorn of his
                  regenerated manhood, as if he saw him staggering over the threshold. He came at
                  last, just as his son's prophetic eye had beheld him, reeling into the room,
                  followed by a rough-looking stranger, who came in with his hat on, and took a seat
                  by the fire, with the confidence of a welcome guest. Marcus gazed upon his father
                  with a look such as a child of light might cast upon fallen humanity, then turned
                  inquiringly towards the dark-bearded and forbidding looking stranger.</p>
               <p>"What are you staring at me so for?" muttered Warland, pushing his chair back at
                  the imminent risk of falling out of it. "Call Milly, and let's have some
                  supper."</p>
               <p>"Marcus has killed a deer," cried little Katy, eager to announce the astounding
                  tidings. "Only think, Marcus has killed a deer, father."</p>
               <p>We will not sully the paper by recording the oath that fell from Warland's lips,
                  and seemed to blister Katy's spotless cheek, for she turned away shrinking, like a
                  young mimosa, and drew nearer Aunt Milly, who was placing the venison and
                  corn-bread on the table, with a clouded brow. She mourned for the renewed
                  degradation of <emph>their house,</emph> and for the fresh sorrows of her darling
                  children. She was unaware of the evil impending over herself.</p>
               <p>"Is this the woman?" asked the stranger, measuring her from head to foot with a
                  bold, calculating glance.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Warland, "but wait a while—the children."</p>
               <p>"I tell you I'm in a hurry," said the man, "and must be off directly. Look round
                  here, nigger, and tell us how old you are."</p>
               <p>"It's none of your business," said Milly, rolling her eyes portentously at him, a
                  faint glimpse of his purpose dawning on her understanding.</p>
               <p>"I shall teach you better manners, I promise you," said the man, giving a whizzing
                  motion to the whip he carried in his right hand, and which he had been trailing
                  idly on the floor.</p>
               <p>"When you're <emph>my</emph> master, you may," said Milly, with a scornful toss of
                  her turbaned brows.</p>
               <p>"I'm your master now, if I choose to take you, so none of your airs to me." Then
                  turning to Warland, who was cowering before the flashing eye of Marcus, he added,
                  "I'll keep to the bargain, and give you what we agreed. If I find you've deceived
                  me, however, and she proves unsound, or lazy, or unmanageable, I'll not pay you
                  one cent."</p>
               <p>"Father," exclaimed Marcus, coming between him and the man, directly in front of
                  Aunt Milly, in whose veins the burning blood of Africa was boiling with
                  indignation; "father, you are not going to sell Aunt Milly—you cannot—you dare not
                  do it."</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC6692-00000022"/>
               <p>"Why can't I?" cried the perjured wretch, quailing before the bright rebuking
                  glance that seemed to scorch his brow, "She belongs to me, and I've a right to do
                  what I please with her."</p>
               <p>"You haven't the right," cried the undaunted boy, "you are perjured if you do it,
                  in the sight of God and men. You promised my mother on her death-bed that you
                  never would part her from us. You told her, if you ever did, that you prayed God
                  would destroy you, body and soul. Oh! my father; think what you are doing. Oh, you
                  don't know what you <emph>are</emph> doing; you are not yourself; I feared it
                  would be so. If you had only stayed at home!" Marcus could not go on; a
                  suffocating sense of shame and dishonour reflected from the author of his being,
                  smothered his voice. Then Aunt Milly's imprisoned wrath found vent. Pressing
                  closer to her, the pale and trembling Katy, who had sprung into her arms and
                  pillowed her white cheek on the sable bosom that had fostered her with all a
                  mother's tenderness, her eyes, burning like ignited charcoal, flashed from her
                  master to the insolent stranger, and back again, their zigzag lightning.</p>
               <p>"I told my mistress," said she, panting at every breath, "I told her they should
                  take every drop of my heart's blood 'fore they took me from these children, and
                  they shall. If master is a mind to parjure his soul, and fly right in the face of
                  the Lord Almighty on the back of the evil sarpent, I'm not going to do it, not I.
                  That's right, honey; hold tight to old Milly, she'll never let go on you long as
                  she breathe the breath of life. Stand up, young master, they can't hurt you; the
                  hairs of your head is all counted. The Lord that 'livered Moses out of the lion's
                  foornace will keep you from the snare of Satan, and the prongs of the wicked
                  ones."</p>
               <p>The man, who seemed to admire this exhibition of spirit, as a proof of the
                  physical power and energy of the slave he was about to purchase, laughed
                  deridingly, and told her to come down off her stilts, and be ready to march.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said Marcus, feeling his strength insufficient to wrestle with this tall,
                  strong man, in defence of Milly, and determined to appeal to his better feelings,
                  "you cannot wish to take from us our only servant. We have no mother, and my
                  little sister would die of grief, if you deprive her of her nurse. She will have
                  no one to take care of her. There are plenty of negroes to buy, who can be better
                  spared, if you must traffic in human blood. Leave us our only one, the last of all
                  we've had."</p>
               <p>The man seemed moved by this appeal, and might have been softened, had it not been
                  for the boy's reproach upon his heartless trade. Angry thus to be rebuked by a
                  mere stripling, a child, he assumed a rougher demeanour, and declared, with a
                  blistering oath, that he would not be browbeat by children, and that the creature
                  should tramp with him directly. He raised his whip in a threatening manner, as if
                  he would intimidate the fair-haired boy who dared to cross his path with such
                  unprecedented boldness.</p>
               <p>With the bound of the young deer, whose antlered head he had so lately laid low,
                  Marcus sprang to the corner where his gun was leaning, seized it, and leaping back
                  in front of Milly, levelled it at the breast of the stranger.</p>
               <p>"Touch her if you dare," said he, in a commanding tone; "lay one finger on her,
                  and I'll stretch you dead at my feet."</p>
               <p>The slight form of the boy seemed to tower and dilate with the energy of his
                  passion, and the darkening iris of his eyes looked black as jet, and scintillated
                  with living sparks. The drunken father, roused by this splendid exhibition of
                  juvenile power, came staggering towards him. "Don't kill him, Marcus—I'll give it
                  up—you see how it is, sir"—he stammered, catching hold of the back of a chair for
                  support. Marcus still stood, moveless as a statue, his eye fixed, his weapon
                  pointed at the breast of the man.</p>
               <p>"Oh, blessed young master!" cried Milly, fully believing he had turned into
                  something more than human; "you mustn't commit murder to save a poor creature like
                  me. I wouldn't have a drop of blood spilled on your white soul to<pb n="46-47"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000023"/> save myself from pardition. Let him take me, an he
                  will; but I vow 'fore my heavenly Master, I'll never eat nor drink one morsel more
                  as long as I live, but jist starve out and out; and I give him joy for the work
                  he'll git out o' me."</p>
               <p>"Put up your gun, young bloodhound," said the man, who had visibly turned pale,
                  under the shade of his shaggy brows, "and keep your old nigger, if you want her.
                  The next time I make a bargain with a drunken man, I'll know what I'm about. Look
                  here, sir, you had better take care of yourself. If you ever make such a fool of
                  me again—do you hear?—I'll blow your brains out."</p>
               <p>With long strides and muttering threats he cleared the cabin, slamming the door
                  after him, so that every plank of the floor vibrated from the concussion. There
                  was silence for a few moments, first broken by the loud sobs of Milly, mingled
                  with the gentler moans of the almost heart-broken little Katy. Marcus went to the
                  door, and, stepping out, shot off the rifle in the air. The echoes went rattling
                  across the river, and fell like rocks on the opposite side.</p>
               <p>"What did you do that for?" asked his father, sullenly, "haven't you made noise
                  enough yet?"</p>
               <p>"I'll tell you what I did it for," answered the boy, with a face as pallid as
                  marble, and an eye glittering like steel. "I was afraid I should kill you, father,
                  and myself too; yes, I was. I never felt as I did just now. Feel my hands, Aunt
                  Milly; are they not cold as ice? and yet I seem turned to fire. I wish we were all
                  dead, Katy and Aunt Milly, and I too. <emph>You</emph> may live, if you want to,
                  father, for you ought to be afraid to die. You have broken your promise to Mr.
                  Bellamy; you have broken your promise to my dead mother; you have broken your
                  promise to God; yes, <emph>you</emph> ought to be afraid to die."</p>
               <p>Here Marcus, who was excited to a transient delirium by the events of the evening,
                  pressed his hands on his forehead and uttered a cry of pain. Aunt Milly caught him
                  in her arms, and as she did so the soft cheek of little Katy pressed against his
                  own. That gentle, velvet pressure seemed to melt the metallic band that was bound
                  round his brain. He put his arms round these beloved friends, all he had in the
                  world, and burst into tears. The image of the beautiful Mrs. Bellamy rose before
                  him, even in that dark moment, but she seemed a star shining in a lone and distant
                  glory, too far for him to feel its lustre. His father had fallen lower than ever,
                  and there was a barrier shutting him from all the good and pure. In the sudden
                  destruction of his long cherished hopes, he felt as if he were himself
                  annihilated, and all his bright future blackened and laid waste.</p>
               <p>"Yes," repeated he, as he pressed his little sister closer and closer to his
                  aching bosom, "it would be better that we were dead and laid in our mother's
                  grave, than live such a life of shame and sorrow as lies before us."</p>

               <p>MARCUS sat beside the <hi rend="i"/>Long Moss Spring, the morning sunbeams
                  glancing through the broad leaves of the magnolia and the brilliant foliage of the
                  holly, and playing on his golden hair. He held in his hand a fishing-rod, whose
                  long line floated on the water; and though his eye was fixed on the buoyant cork,
                  there was no hope or excitement in its gaze. His face was pale, and wore a severe
                  expression, very different from the usual joyousness and thoughtlessness of
                  childhood. Even when the silvery trout and shining perch, lured by the bait, hung
                  quivering on the hook, and were thrown, fluttering like<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000024"/> wounded birds through the air, to fall panting,
                  then pulseless, at his side, he showed no consciousness of success, no elation at
                  the number of his scaly victims. Tears, even large and slowly gathering tears,
                  rolled gradually and reluctantly down his fair oval cheeks; they were not like the
                  sudden, drenching shower, that leaves the air purer and the sky bluer, but the
                  drops that issue from the wounded bark formed of the life-blood of the tree.</p>
               <p>Beautiful was the spot where the boy sat, and beautiful the vernal morning that
                  awakened Nature to the joy and the beauty of youth. The fountain, over whose basin
                  he was leaning, was one of those clear, deep, pellucid springs, that gush up in
                  the green wilds of southern Georgia, forming a feature of such exquisite
                  loveliness in the landscape, that the traveller pauses on the margin, feeling as
                  if he had found one of those enchanted springs of which we read in fairy land,
                  whose waters are too bright, too pure, too serene for earth.</p>
               <p>The stone which formed the basin of the fountain was smooth and calcareous,
                  hollowed out by the friction of the waters, and gleaming white and cold through
                  their diaphanous drapery. In the centre of this basin, where the spring gushed in
                  all its depth and strength, it was so dark it looked like an opaque body,
                  impervious to the eye, whence it flowed over the edge of its rocky receptacle in a
                  full, rejoicing current, sweeping over its mossy bed, and bearing its sounding
                  tribute to the Chattahoochee, "rolling rapidly." The mossy bed to which we have
                  alluded was not the verdant velvet that covers with a short, curling nap, the
                  ancient rock and the gray old tree, but long, slender, emerald-green plumes,
                  waving under the water, and assuming through its mirror a tinge of deep and
                  irradiant blue. Nothing can be imagined more rich and graceful than this carpet
                  for the fountain's silvery tread, and which seems to bend beneath it, as the light
                  spray rustling in the breeze. The golden water-lily gleamed up through the
                  crystal, and floated along the margin on its long and undulating stems.</p>
               <p>This was the favourite haunt of Marcus, and he had baptized it by the name of the
                     <hi rend="i"/>Long Moss Spring. It was here he had often indulged in his dreams
                  of ambition, and it was here he now yielded to the deadening influences of
                  despair. The despair of a child caused by a father's shame and perjury is enough
                  to make angels weep.</p>
               <p>"Marcus!" said a hoarse voice near him. He turned round, and beheld his father,
                  whose wild and haggard countenance looked at him through the leafy curtain of the
                  fountain. "Marcus!" repeated he, pushing aside the boughs, and coming and sitting
                  down on the rock by his side; "will you let me sit by you a few moments? I have
                  something I wish to say to you, and this place is so tranquil—so sweet!"</p>
               <p>"Will I <emph>let</emph> you, father? Oh, don't speak to me in that way."</p>
               <p>"I have no right to force my polluted presence on you, my son. After what passed
                  last night, I cannot blame you if you refuse to own such a wretch as your father.
                  I little thought, yesterday morning, when I left you with such presumptuous
                  confidence, I should return like the swine, to its wallow in the mire. The man who
                  accompanied me home must have known my besetting weakness, for he tempted me
                  sorely before I yielded, and then taking advantage of my condition, induced me to
                  make the bargain with him which perjured my soul, and severed the last link that
                  binds my children to me. Marcus, you told me last night you was afraid you would
                  kill me."</p>
               <p>"Oh! father, don't recall those dreadful words—I was distracted—I didn't know what
                  I said. Forgive me, father; I never <emph>can</emph> forgive myself."</p>
               <p>"No, Marcus, reproach not yourself. Those words, and some others you uttered, may
                  prove my salvation yet. I cannot hope that you will rely on my promises of
                  reformation; but I never have felt as I have since I saw you and little Katy
                  weeping on each other's necks, in the arms of that faithful negro, of whose care I
                  was about to deprive you Your words pierced me to the heart's core. The fumes
                     of<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6692-00000025"/> inebriation dispersed, and I
                  loathed myself in dust and ashes. All the livelong night I have been upon my
                  knees, on this very rock, praying for help from on high. I make no more
                  self-righteous boasts. I throw myself on the mercy of God, in the humble hope that
                  He will not cast me off. 'Though our sins be as scarlet, they may be made white as
                  wool.' Alas! mine would the pure waters of this fountain incarnadine, dyeing them
                  with the hue of blood."</p>
               <p>"Father, I wish last night were blotted from existence. I feel as if I should
                  never be happy again."</p>
               <p>"Strange, that hope should spring from the very ashes of despair. But it is even
                  so, my son. Lost, degraded as I am, unworthy to hold fellowship with my innocent
                  children, or even with the dark African of a whiter soul, I feel a vitality that I
                  thought annihilated before. It seems as if I had heard a revelation from heaven,
                  making known to me that you, my son, were to lead me back to virtue and to peace.
                  It came to me when I was grovelling on my knees at midnight. It grew clearer at
                  breaking day. Just now, a voice seemed to sound in my ear, like a voice from
                  heaven, 'Arise and go to thy son. Thy son on earth shall yet lead thee to thy
                  Father in heaven.'"</p>
               <p>"Oh, father!" exclaimed Marcus. It was all he could utter, but he took his hand
                  and pressed it in both his own, and they thus sat mutely together, looking down
                  into the dark heart of the fountain whence the silver rills were gushing. These
                  waters were an emblem of regeneration. Marcus, with the transilient spirit of
                  youth, bounded from despair to hope, and the whole aspect of nature was changed.
                  The thought of his lovely benefactress came like a rainbow of promise, spanning
                  the spray of the fountain, and reminding him of the covenant he had made with his
                  own soul, when she bade him farewell. It inspired him to make a new covenant, that
                  he would fulfil the glorious mission Heaven had committed into his hands, of
                  reclaiming his father; and if it required the filial devotion of his whole life,
                  he would no think it too dear a price to pay for such a blessing. He had
                  previously been incited by the desire of lifting <emph>himself</emph> from
                  obscurity and poverty, of providing for his little sister the means of education;
                  but now a higher, holier motive was added to these. He had been looking forward to
                  the struggle of life as one who was to go on unaided and alone, stemming a
                  counter-current, that threatened to sweep away in its stronger tide the frail bark
                  of his hopes. Now, he must turn that strong, dark current in a different
                  direction; he must make it flow along with the pure, rippling stream on which he
                  himself was borne; he must purify and gild it, by mingling the once opposing
                  waves. He upbraided himself for ever looking on his father with loathing and
                  scorn, when under the influence of his fatal passion; for the lofty tone he had
                  often assumed, when entreaties and supplications had been in vain. He would
                  henceforth regard him in sorrow, rather than indignation, and by treating him with
                  constant deference and tenderness, restore him to his own self-respect. Conforming
                  to these noble resolutions, he induced him to accompany him in all his hunting and
                  fishing expeditions, never leaving him for his own amusement, but convincing him
                  that his fellowship was indispensable for his enjoyment.</p>
               <p>As the resisting tree, shaken by the whirlwind, but not uprooted, only clings more
                  firmly to its native soil, Aunt Milly was more deeply implanted in the affections
                  and interests of the household since the night of her threatened removal. It
                  cannot be said that Aunt Milly forgot the ingratitude of her master to her
                  fidelity, or his perjury to her departed mistress; but her overmastering love for
                  the children enabled her to forgive the wrongs inflicted by the father; and she
                  knew, too, that her duty as a Christian required her to return good for evil.
                  While injuries remain cut in, deep as life, on the heart of the red child of the
                  wilderness, they are traced on the <emph>surface</emph> of the African's, and may
                  be effaced by the breath of kindness.</p>
               <p>"Do not be angry with my poor father, Aunt Milly," said Marcus, with his sweet,
                  persuading voice; "he was tempted<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6692-00000026"/> by that
                  evil man. He was no more himself at the time than if he were crazy. <emph>I</emph>
                  was crazy myself for a few moments, and knew not what I was doing."</p>
               <p>"Oh! young master, if it hadn't been for you—Lord a marcy—if I live to the age of
                  Methusah, I never shall forget it; you warnt a boy then, you was a sperrit; you
                  were super-nateral. It was a maracle, and nothing else; Simon says so; and he says
                  the man couldn't hurt you, nohow he could fix it, any more than Daniel could the
                  fiery children."</p>
               <p>"Daniel was a prophet, and a good man, Aunt Milly. He was the one that was cast in
                  the lion's den, and whom the Lord defended from their fury."</p>
               <p>"That's just what I meant, exactly. I does mistake sometimes, but I means right; I
                  does mean to put burning coals on ole master's head, for the preacher says it's
                  our duty to do it."</p>
               <p>"What do you understand by that, Aunt Milly? You don't believe, I hope, that you
                  ought to take live coals from the chimney, and pour them on your master's
                  head."</p>
               <p>"No, Master Marcus; I know better than all that. It means to sarve one good; when
                  they do <emph>you</emph> bad, to speak pleasant and 'cifical; when they are cross
                  and <emph>contrary,</emph> and when they strike you on one side, to turn right
                  round and let 'em strike t'other; that's what it means. And I knows, if
                     <emph>I've</emph> injured anybody, and they does so to me, I feels as bad as if
                  burning coals was sticking to the top of my head."</p>
               <p>One evening, they were sitting under a little stoup in front of the cabin, at that
                  twilight hour when the labours of the day are over, but the exercises of the
                  evening not yet commenced,—that hour of sweet tranquillity and rest. The river
                  rolled before them, reflecting in its sparkling waters the gorgeous tints of
                  departing day; the crimson shading off into a deepening orange, the orange melting
                  into flakes of glittering silver. Lazily the old ferry-boat lay against the bank,
                  the long poles thrown across the wet planks, and a red handkerchief of Milly's
                  fastened to the lantern-post, fluttering like a banner in the breeze. It was a
                  device of Marcus, who had been giving a pleasure trip to Milly and Katy, and who
                  had converted the red turban of the former into a flag of triumph.</p>
               <p>Marcus looked at his father, and exulted to see that the vacant and haggard aspect
                  of inebriation had given place to a calm and intelligent expression. His
                  complexion was clear of that purple hue with which the god of the grape marks the
                  face of his votaries. He was dressed with neatness and respectability, for Milly
                  always took great care of her master's person; and one of her greatest sorrows,
                  during his fits of intoxication, was the personal neglect they induced. The soiled
                  linen, the unshaven beard, and matted locks were sore afflictions to her pride,
                  for she said, "If a man was born a gentleman, and likely looking besides, it was a
                  crying sin to make himself into a live brute."</p>
               <p>A gentleman was seen winding through the path that skirted the river's edge. He
                  was mounted on horseback, and rode leisurely along, looking earnestly on the
                  family trio.</p>
               <p>"It is Mr. Bellamy!" exclaimed Marcus, leaping from the steps to the ground. Katy
                  flew after him, and Warland, walking with slow steps, went forward to greet the
                  friend who thus proved himself true to his promise. Had <emph>he</emph> been true?
                  This self-interrogation brought a blush of shame to his cheek, as he felt the
                  cordial grasp of Mr. Bellamy's hand, but he did not shrink from his kindly-beaming
                  glance, for he resolved to tell him of his shameful lapse, even at the risk of
                  forfeiting all his good-will. Mr. Bellamy seemed gratified at his reception and at
                  the appearance of family comfort that met his eye. He pressed the hand of Marcus
                  with parental kindness, and taking the smiling, blushing Katy in his arms, bore
                  her in triumph to the cabin. Milly came to the door of the kitchen, dropping low
                  and emphatic curtsies, and Uncle Simon hobbled out to take care of his horse.</p>
               <p>"Well, my friend," said he, sitting down on the wooden bench in the stoup, "the
                  world seems to have gone better with you since I saw you last. I am glad my little
                  friends here have not forgotten me, for I have often thought of them."</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC6692-00000027"/>
               <p>"Forgotten!" repeated Marcus; "how could we forget friends so kind as you and Mrs.
                  Bellamy?"</p>
               <p>"Why didn't she come too?" whispered Katy.</p>
               <p>"She could not leave home just now, but you shall see her one of these days. She
                  put some presents in my valise for you and Marcus, which I will show you
                  presently."</p>
               <p>Katy was burning with impatience to know what the rich and beautiful lady had sent
                  her; but Marcus, grateful to be remembered in any way, scarcely cared to know in
                  what manner. A withered leaf sent to <emph>him</emph> by <emph>her</emph> hand
                  would be cherished as a sacred relic; still when Mr. Bellamy opened his valise and
                  displayed the elegant books his wife had deposited there for Marcus, and the nice
                  frocks for Katy, he felt a glow of gratitude and delight words would have vainly
                  endeavoured to express. A dress for Aunt Milly and a gorgeous handkerchief for her
                  head were hailed with equal enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>After supper, at which Milly flourished with more than her usual aristocracy, for
                  she had a splendid dish of fish to set before him, besides fried eggs and bacon,
                  when the pipes were lighted and the blue smoke began to give an Indian summer
                  atmosphere to the cabin, Mr. Bellamy reverted to the conversation he had had six
                  months before, and asked Warland if he remembered it. Marcus, believing that his
                  father would prefer the absence of the children, took Katy's hands, who still
                  hugged her presents to her bosom, and carrying his books in his arms, went to the
                  kitchen, where he exhibited the beautiful engravings they contained to the
                  wondering and enraptured eyes of Milly and Simon. Warland did not deceive Mr.
                  Bellamy; he related the scene so disgraceful to himself, so honourable to his son,
                  which has already been recorded, and the thorough change he believed wrought
                  within himself in consequence of his boy's conduct.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Mr. Bellamy, you see before you a fallen man, utterly unworthy of your
                  confidence; still so dreadful was the shock I received that night, so terrible the
                  revulsion of my feelings, I have since loathed the very idea of drink; I think I
                  could see it without being tempted, but I may be deceived. I do not ask any favour
                  for myself—I ought not to receive any—but for my children. Sir, any thing you
                  could do for them would be a blessing worthy of eternal gratitude. My boy
                     <emph>is</emph> a noble child; he <emph>was</emph> born for something better
                  than the miserable destiny to which I have doomed him."</p>
               <p>"You judge too hardly of yourself. I am encouraged and strengthened in all my
                  hopes with regard to you. One lapse, so sincerely repented of, is less than I
                  dared to expect. No, no, Warland, I am not going to give you up so readily; your
                  countenance is the seal of your reformation. I never saw a man improved so much in
                  six months; I scarcely recognised you. I am not afraid to trust you. I am more
                  afraid that you will reject the situation I am about to offer, as beneath your
                  merits and ambition."</p>
               <p>Warland turned an inquiring glance upon his friend—"There is no situation that you
                  would offer me that I should consider too low for acceptance, if it brought my
                  children within the pale of civilized life."</p>
               <p>"I have a large plantation," said Mr. Bellamy, "and a great number of negroes,
                  that require superintendence in their labour. I have always found it difficult to
                  obtain an overseer qualified for the office—one who can combine the <foreign
                     xml:lang="LAT">suaviter in modo</foreign> with the <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >fortiter in re.</foreign> The one whom I now employ will be dismissed in a
                  short time. Will you supply his place? You can bring your talents and education to
                  bear upon the office; for the slaves do homage to mind, and know, as if by
                  intuition, the man whom knowledge has enlightened and polished, from the
                  unlettered boor. You shall have a salary sufficient for the support of your
                  family. Marcus I intend to send immediately to school; and my wife, who has been
                  entreating me to adopt a little girl, will take little Katy under her own
                  immediate charge. I wish I could offer you a situation more congenial, but I think
                  it better than the one you now occupy. It is rather as an assistant overseer I
                  want to engage you, for I devote a great deal of my own time to superintending<pb
                     n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6692-00000028"/> intending my plantation, and watching
                  over the interests of my slaves."</p>
               <p>"Most gladly, most gratefully would I accept the proposition," replied Warland,
                  deeply sensible of the kindness of his new friend, "could I believe myself
                  qualified for its duties; but ought I, who have so lately manifested such a
                  melancholy instance of the want of self-government, assume the control of others?
                  Ought I to take advantage of your benevolence, and perhaps expose you to
                  disappointment and loss?"</p>
               <p>"I am willing to expose myself to all the risk; but you must not give me more
                  credit than is due. Mrs. Bellamy has been a quickening spirit to me, and planned
                  the whole, leaving me nothing but a willing cooperation in her designs. Your boy
                  has perfectly bewitched her. She looks upon him as a young eaglet, whose yet
                  unfledged wings will one day bear him to a sunbright eyrie. I think myself he was
                  born for distinction, and that he will attain it. Will you lay the first
                  stepping-stone for him?"</p>
               <p>"I cannot refuse. I will do all I can to deserve your confidence. The time has
                  been when such an offer would have been considered by me an unpardonable insult;
                  now, I feel ennobled by it. Let me call my son, and communicate to him his
                  brightening prospects."</p>
               <p>Marcus, while he felt the most intense gratitude to Mr. Bellamy, could not help
                  shrinking from the idea of his father's becoming an overseer. He had been thinking
                  so long of seeing him reinstated in his former standing in society as a gentleman
                  and a scholar, that any position short of that seemed inferior to his merits, and
                  below his ambition. Mr. Bellamy read all this in the boy's expressive countenance,
                  and he liked him better for his noble pride.</p>
               <p>"Your father will be my friend, my boy," said he. "I mean he shall dignify his
                  office, and raise it to a higher stand than it usually occupies; and I consider it
                  only a preparatory step to his future advancement. Had I made him a gratuitous
                  proposition, he would have rejected it at once. I could think of nothing better
                  than this at present."</p>
               <p>"Do not think me ungrateful, sir," said Marcus; "we cannot fail to be happy near
                  you and Mrs. Bellamy. It ought to be the business of our whole lives to endeavour
                  to repay your kindness. Words can never do it, I know; but I hope some day my
                  actions can speak my heart."</p>
               <p>The boy spoke with an earnest grace and a kindling blush. Every strong emotion
                  sent a glowing herald to his cheek, and a radiant messenger to his eye, bearing
                  witness to its reality and truth.</p>
               <p>When Milly learned, through Marcus, the change in his father's situation, her
                  family pride was at first wounded; for if there is any thing an African despises,
                  it is a common overseer. But when she heard that little Katy was to be taken into
                  the household of that "sweet Mrs. Bellamy," and that she herself was to go with
                  her and take care of her; that master Marcus was to be sent to a fine school,
                  where he would prepare for college, and associate with gentlemen's sons, she was
                  in a fever of joyful excitement. She had arrayed little Katy in one of the pretty
                  frocks Mrs. Bellamy had sent her, and it so adorned the child, that, seeing
                  herself in the mirror of Aunt Milly's admiring eyes, she blushed at her own
                  loveliness.</p>
               <p>"Katy will be a lady, and ride in a fine carriage," said Milly, turning her round
                  and round, and smoothing down the folds of her short, redundant skirt; "she no
                  wear homespun no more; she live among the quality folks."</p>
               <p>"Katy will be a good girl," said Marcus, putting his arms round the beautiful
                  child; "and she will love the dear lady who is so good to us all. She will not be
                  vain, nor proud, because she may wear a finer dress, for that would spoil all her
                  sweetness."</p>
               <p>"Jist hear him," said Milly, giving Simon a punch in his side; "he allos sets
                  everybody right, and make 'em feel 'shamed. He born for a preacher."</p>
               <p>Simon answered not, for his heart was full. The thought<pb n="58-59"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000029"/> of being parted from his friend filled him with
                  unutterable sorrow; and when the children saw his dark, wrinkled cheeks irrigated
                  with tears, sympathizing drops filled their before glad eyes. Aunt Milly began to
                  rock, like a storm-blown tree.</p>
               <p>"She'd never thought about it. What would they do without Simon, and what would
                  Simon do without them? Poor ole Simon! Poor ole Milly!"</p>
               <p>This was really a dark cloud to their new-born happiness. They all loved the
                     <emph>old soldier,</emph> as they called him, and mourned to think they must
                  leave him behind.</p>
               <p>Milly promised to write to him by proxy; Marcus to come and see him as soon as
                  possible; and Katy never to leave him at all. Still poor Simon sat with his head
                  bowed on his hands, his breast heaving with stifled sobs. "He spoke not, for his
                  grief was very great."</p>

               <p>No fairer, richer picture of southern life could be drawn than from the plantation
                  of Mr. Bellamy. Far as the eye could reach, his magnificent cotton and corn fields
                  rolled in snowy opulence, or waved in golden splendour in the undulating gale. The
                  house was situated on a gradual eminence, which was crowned with a beautiful grove
                  of young hickories, and was in consequence known by the name of Hickory Hill. It
                  was also called Bellamy Place by those familiar with the name of its munificent
                  master. Occupying so commanding a site, with its broad, spreading wings, and lofty
                  piazza that extended the whole length of the building, it was a kind of landmark
                  to the traveller who might be journeying through the pine woods that girdled the
                  boundaries of his domain. At night, when its myriad windows reflected the
                  hospitable radiance glowing within, and the pine torches blazed from the tall
                  posts without, it resembled a light-house, flashing its beacon lustre on the eye
                  of the stranger, perchance in danger of being lost in that unknown sea of verdure.
                  On each side of the mansion-house a long row of neat, white cabins, individualized
                  by some favourite tree, or vine, or plant, showed that the master, who had so
                  amply provided for his own comfort, had not forgotten the accommodation of his
                  slaves. Behind each of these cabins was a small garden, belonging to the negro who
                  occupied it, which was as much his exclusive property as the fields he assisted to
                  cultivate were his master's. They all had time allowed them to till these peculiar
                  lots, as the luxuriant melon vines and flourishing vegetables indicated, and every
                  Saturday afternoon they carried their produce to market, as well as the poultry
                  and eggs they themselves had raised. It is true, they were <emph>slaves,</emph>
                  but their chains never clanked. Each separate link was kept moist and bright with
                  the oil of kindness, applied with a downy touch. Mr. and Mrs. Bellamy were both
                  actuated by high and holy principles. They felt deeply and seriously the
                  responsibilities resting upon them. They were each the inheritors of a large
                  fortune, consisting, as it usually does at the South, of negro families. None had
                  been purchased except where marriages had been formed, and the wife or husband
                  pleaded in behalf of their chosen partners, and Mr. Bellamy had never violated the
                  promise made to his dying father, that he would not separate the families which
                  had grown up around him, or sell <emph>one</emph> accessible to gratitude and
                  kindness. He respected the holy ties of nature, and believed that the domestic
                  affections glowed as warmly and purely in the dark bosom of the African as the
                  fairer European's. No severed, bleeding heart ever accused him before God of its
                  widowhood and desolation; no cry of maternal anguish; no sable Rachel, "weeping
                  for her children," would rise up in judgment against him, at the tribunal of
                  sovereign justice. Did all southern planters<pb n="60-61"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000030"/> imitate his noble example, the foulest blot that
                  darkens the page of slavery would be effaced, its deepest reproach wiped away.
                  Those who batten on the sale of human blood would be obliged to stop their
                  languishing traffic, and resort to some more honourable and Christian
                  occupation.</p>
               <p>Could Mr. Bellamy have believed that the happiness and best interests of his
                  slaves would be secured by presenting them the gift of freedom, he would have done
                  it. But he felt, that by turning hundreds of helpless beings adrift upon the
                  world, he would be rather exposing them to want and temptation, than administering
                  to their well-being.</p>
               <p>"I didn't purchase them," thus reasoned he with his own conscience. "I did not
                  wrest them from their native land, benighted and degraded as it is. I received
                  them as a trust; and a heavy one it is. If I give them freedom, it will be like a
                  diamond crown on the head of an infant. It will weigh it down, without its being
                  conscious of its splendid value. No! though I would give all that I am worth, or
                  ever expect to be worth, to be free from this moral encumbrance, I cannot shake it
                  off without doing violence to my own sense of duty. I will endeavour to perform
                  the work appointed by my great Task-master in such a manner, that when I am called
                  to render up my account at the great day of reckoning, I can bare my heart to the
                  blazing eye of Almighty truth, and say, 'Here am I, and the beings intrusted to my
                  charge.'"</p>
               <p>It was a lovely summer evening,—(in the South, as soon as the sun has passed the
                  zenith, the evening is supposed to begin,)—and the windows of Bellamy Place were
                  all opened to admit the balmy air, that flowed in redolent with a thousand
                  perfumes exhaled from the wreathing vines and flowering shrubs. The lovely
                  mistress of this charming spot had beautified it with all the wealth of Flora, and
                  all the wild garlands of the forest. Every thing seemed to flourish under her
                  gentle care, every thing took root and grew in her genial soil. The very air of
                  heaven seemed to love her, for it always stole in blandly and fragrantly, even on
                  the sultriest days, to kiss her benign brow. This sweet evening she was sitting in
                  a crimson-covered rocking chair, reading the pages of a book, that seemed "her
                  inmost soul to find," while a young girl of about fourteen stood by her side,
                  twisting the flowers of the white jasmine in her dark and braided locks. The sweet
                  face of Mrs. Bellamy had lost none of the winning charms that distinguished her
                  several years before, while the soft glow of health now added to its attraction. A
                  dress of thin white muslin softened the graceful outlines of her figure, and the
                  flowers with which youthful taste and affection had decorated her hair, gave even
                  a juvenile loveliness to her appearance, congenial to the young maiden who was
                  bending over her. Katy's violet eyes had lost none of their pensive loveliness of
                  expression, nor had her pure white cheek won one tint of rose from the fragrant
                  and elevated atmosphere she breathed; but the bright hue of her lips redeemed her
                  face from the idea of pallidness, and there were moments when those drooping eyes,
                  suddenly lifted, would flash with gay emotion, and a rosy shadow flit over the
                  lilies of her cheek. On a low chair, a little removed from Mrs. Bellamy, sat a
                  young mulatto girl, who, from her singular beauty and docility, was the pet of the
                  household. Her hair, long, black, and shiny as an Indian's, with a slight
                  inclination to wave, was braided behind in imitation of her mistress; her eyes
                  were soft and bright as a gazelle's, and beneath her clear, dark cheek the red
                  blood glowed with a vermeil tinge. Her teeth, white and transparent as alabaster,
                  glittered when she smiled, and her walk had the springy, yet flowing, grace of the
                  leopard's. Cora, for such was the name of the beautiful mulatto, was mistress of
                  the needle, and had been brought up in the house, under the affectionate and
                  watchful eye of her mistress. Her language, in consequence of this, was free from
                  the peculiarities of the African dialect. Mrs. Bellamy loved Cora as tenderly as
                  if no dusky tint shaded the ruby of her cheek; and had Mrs. Bellamy been an angel
                  of light, Cora could not have worshipped her with more entire devotion.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC6692-00000031"/>
               <p>"Can any thing look sweeter than that?" exclaimed Katy, appealing to Cora to
                  admire the starry blossoms that gleamed on the dark satin of her mistress's
                  hair.</p>
               <p>"Mistress looks sweet, let her wear what she will," replied Cora, looking up from
                  her work, with a bright smile.</p>
               <p>"You are both flatterers," said Mrs. Bellamy, "and I know you are making me look
                  too girlish," putting her hand to her head.</p>
               <p>"Oh, please don't," cried both voices, "please don't spoil it."</p>
               <p>At this moment a rapid step was heard ascending the stairs; there was a light
                  bound over the threshold, and a youth of sixteen summers leaped into the centre of
                  the room. Waving his straw-hat in one hand, while he pushed back with the other
                  the fair brown-curls from his moist brow, he cried,—</p>
               <p>"Victory, dear Mrs. Bellamy! Victory, Katy! I've won the prize, the golden badge
                  of merit, and I come to lay it at the feet of my benefactors." Then bending one
                  knee with sportive grace before Mrs. Bellamy, he took from his neck a blue ribbon,
                  from which was suspended a golden medal, and laid it on her lap.</p>
               <p>"Well done, Marcus," said Mrs. Bellamy, gazing with pride and delight on the
                  noble-looking boy who thus vindicated her early prophecy. "I knew you could not
                  fail; this is only a foretaste of the honours that await you in a larger
                  sphere."</p>
               <p>"I hope so, madam; I hope so for your sake. I only cared to obtain this because I
                  thought it would gratify you. What shall I do with it? I should despise myself
                  tricked out with blue ribbons and trinkets. Katy must wear it till I return from
                  college, and let it be in her eyes an emblem of ambition. It is in the form of a
                  harp, Mrs. Bellamy, you see, strung with twisted threads of gold. It will remind
                  Katy of her music, and how anxious you are that she should excel."</p>
               <p>Marcus passed the azure band round the fair neck of Katy, who felt proud of
                  wearing the badge of her brother's excellence. It was a prize awarded by a
                  committee of gentlemen for the best essay on a given subject written by the pupils
                  of a high school, at which he had graduated. He could have entered college two
                  years previous, but Mr. Bellamy thought him too young to be exposed to the
                  temptations of such a life, and preferred that he should enter in advance, and
                  thus shorten the time of his collegiate studies. He was to depart in a few weeks
                  for the most distinguished university of the South, and should he bear away the
                  first honours, Mr. Bellamy promised to reward him by sending him afterward to one
                  of the literary institutions of the North. Burning with desire to prove himself
                  worthy of this munificence, Marcus looked forward to his departure with the eager
                  anticipations of youth, and the distinction he had just won seemed only an earnest
                  of his future success.</p>
               <p>When supper was announced, Warland came in with Mr. Bellamy, and took his seat at
                  the table by the side of his children. While there was no apparent change in the
                  person of the latter, <emph>he</emph> looked greatly altered, and the burden of
                  many years seemed added to his frame. His hair was almost white, proof of the
                  terrible warfare he had sustained with his bosom foe; his complexion was very
                  pale, and his upright form bent from its perpendicular line; but his eye was
                  clear, and the throne of an unclouded intellect. Though its light was ofttimes
                  darkened by the shadows of memory, never since his dwelling with Mr. Bellamy had
                  it been quenched in the night of intemperance. He had performed his duties to his
                  benefactor with unerring fidelity and marked success, and it was now as an
                  honoured friend and faithful coadjutor, even as a beloved brother, that he
                  remained in the household of the planter. Aunt Milly came in her ancient costume
                  of the white turban and stiff white apron, and stood with folded hands behind her
                  master's chair till the customary blessing consecrated the board; then, with an
                  elevated brow and aristocratic mien, she carried her gilded waiter back and forth
                  to supply the wants of her children, as she always called them, and "ole master."
                  There was a peculiar delicacy of kindness in Mrs. Bellamy's giving this office to
                  Milly, for her own servants were trained<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC6692-00000032"/>
                  to wait upon her table, and did its honours with more grace and dexterity, than
                  one belonging, like Aunt Milly, to the <hi rend="i"/>ancient regime. She knew she
                  would be happy in proportion as she thought herself useful, and she had no desire
                  to wean Marcus or Katy from their allegiance to their true and faithful nurse.
                  Sometimes the little ebony images that stood on each side of the table waving
                  beautiful brushes of sun-eyed peacock's feathers, with tremendous flourishes,
                  would purposely hit her lofty turban, but she never swerved from her majestic
                  course, satisfying her dignity by giving them a rebuking roll of her large
                  eyeballs. The beautiful mulatto girl had the post of honour by her mistress's
                  chair, and a tall, handsome mulatto man, with an apron of snowy whiteness reaching
                  to his knees, and a waiter under his arm, held the same position at the right hand
                  of his master. Many a brilliant eye-beam and glittering smile were exchanged
                  across the table by this distinguished pair. They were betrothed in marriage, and
                  the coming Christmas was appointed for their nuptials. The coquettish Cora denied
                  the truth of this fact, and declared it was only a false report, and that there
                  was nothing in the world in it; but when her mistress told her what a beautiful
                  wedding-dress she was going to give her, and what a fine supper too, she hung her
                  head and laughed, and said "she shouldn't wonder if she did get married."</p>
               <p>Cora was the belle of the plantation, and there were others besides King, the
                  handsome mulatto, who contended for her smiles. There was one negro, of Cimmerian
                  blackness, of the name of Hannibal, who was a formidable rival to the gallant
                  King; not that Cora regarded him with a favouring eye, but he possessed great
                  muscular power, and his temper when roused was fierce as the goaded lion's. Mr.
                  Bellamy had more trouble with him than any other slave on the plantation, but he
                  was at the same time one of his most valuable men. He was nick-named the General,
                  and honoured his title by exercising authority over his younger and weaker
                  brethren. He was attached to his master, and when no counter feelings opposed his
                  sense of obligation to him, he would work with an enthusiasm that communicated
                  like wild-fire to all around him.</p>
               <p>"Push on," they would exclaim, "don't you see the General ahead?" And the cotton
                  bolls would fly thick as northern snow-flakes, and the huge baskets heave high
                  with their downy burdens.</p>
               <p>But lately Hannibal had been in a dark sullen mood, and neither persuasion nor
                  coercion had any effect on his obstinate resistance of duty. Mr. Bellamy,
                  believing that a spirit like his would spurn at delegated authority, told Warland
                  whenever symptoms of rebellion appeared in the Carthaginian general to refer him
                  to <emph>him,</emph> and he usually succeeded by personal influence in recalling
                  him to duty and obedience. Now smarting from the pangs of disappointed love, and
                  maddened by the triumphant happiness of his rival, he broke out in open mutiny,
                  and was placed, by the orders of his master, in solitary confinement, till he had
                  leisure to reflect on the best course to pursue with the offending slave. As soon
                  as supper was over Mr. Bellamy was about to leave the room, anxious to perform his
                  disagreeable task, fearful that he might be compelled to have recourse to the
                  dreaded alternative of selling him, and filling with anguish a mother's heart.
                  Hannibal was the only son of an aged mother, who was now trembling in her cabin
                  for the consequences of his rebellion to his much-enduring master.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy, who noticed the clouded brow of her husband, followed him into the
                  passage, that she might learn the cause.</p>
               <p>"Let me go to him, my husband," said she; "I think I have more influence over him
                  than any one else, and I know so well the cause of his present wayward humour. If
                  love has subverted empires, razed cities to their foundations, and shaken the
                  boasted reason of the white man, we ought to make great allowance for its
                  influence on less enlightened minds and stronger passions. You are weary, I see
                  you are; give me the lamp and key, and I pledge my word, that Hannibal<pb
                     n="66-67" xml:id="VAC6692-00000033"/> shall return to his allegiance on the
                  morrow, like a true and valiant soldier."</p>
               <p>"Isabel, this will never do. It is a shame to impose such a task on you. Indeed, I
                  cannot allow it."</p>
               <p>"But you must, Mr. Bellamy. When did you ever refuse any request of mine? A woman
                  knows so much better where all the keys of the human heart are placed than man.
                  Hannibal has a heart, as his passionate love for Cora but too plainly shows."</p>
               <p>Gently but irresistibly she drew the lamp and key from her husband's hand, and
                  glided on to the solitary room, where the General was awaiting the threatened
                  visit of his master, arming himself with strength to withstand both the voice of
                  reason and the menaces of violated authority. The key turned—a bright light
                  flashed into the apartment, and instead of the kind but severe countenance he
                  expected to behold, the sweet face and white-robed form of his mistress beamed
                  upon his gaze. She stood alone before the tall, powerful negro, over whose raven
                  features passion had, if possible, spread a darker hue.</p>
               <p>"Hannibal," said she, bending on him her serene and serious eyes, "I am very sorry
                  to see you here, in disgrace. What have you been doing to deserve this
                  punishment?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, mistress, just nothing at all."</p>
               <p>"Was it your master, or Mr. Warland, who had you confined here?"</p>
               <p>"'Twas master. I tell you what, mistress, if it had been anybody but master, I'd a
                  killed him fust."</p>
               <p>"You don't mean to tell <emph>me,</emph> Hannibal, that your master confined you
                  for <emph>nothing?</emph> You must not say that a second time. Look me in the
                  face, and tell me, if you can, that your master has ever been unjust or unkind to
                  you."</p>
               <p>"It makes no difference, mistress, who is kind, as long as there is
                     <emph>one</emph> that treats me like a dog. It turns my heart black to
                  everybody. I can't help what I do, if they kill me for it."</p>
               <p>"If you mean Cora, you are very wrong, Hannibal. She is not to blame if she loves
                  another better than you. She cannot help it. Besides, King paid her a great deal
                  of attention, and tried hard to win her, before you ever said a word about loving
                  her. If you had spoken first, very likely she would have liked you best."</p>
               <p>"I don't know what to say to please the ladies," said the African chief, with a
                  grim smile; "I can't put on airs and make believe I'm a gentleman, like that
                  yellow boy they think such a 'Donis—all on 'em."</p>
               <p>"Now, Hannibal, I want you to listen to me," said the lady, setting down her lamp,
                  and taking a seat on a wooden bench; "you ought to have more sense than to lose
                  all your dignity of character for a young girl, who loved another before she knew
                  you had one thought of her. You make yourself very unhappy; you set a bad example
                  to the other negroes, who look up to you as a pattern; you disturb the peace of
                  your indulgent master, and you fill with anguish the heart of your mistress."</p>
               <p>"I never thought of giving pain to you, mistress." The tone of his voice was
                  softened, and his head began to droop towards his breast.</p>
               <p>"I have always treated you kindly. I have always tried to make you happy. You know
                  when you were sick last winter, and laid up so long, how we watched over you, your
                  master and myself, and brought you back to health and strength. You blessed us
                  then, and said you never would forget it as long as you lived. You said it was not
                  the medicine or the watching you thanked us for, for that might have been for our
                  own interests, but for the tears we shed when we thought you were dying; that
                  proved we cared for you, for your own sake. Don't you remember it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—that I do, mistress—that I do—every word you say be true." His lips began to
                  quiver, and tears chased each other down his midnight cheeks.</p>
               <p>"I see you are sorry, Hannibal. You do not wish your master to sell you."</p>
               <p>"The Lord have mercy on me!—no, mistress."</p>
               <pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC6692-00000034"/>
               <p>"Well, if you ever trouble him again, as you have to-day, he is resolved to do it.
                  He will not allow the peace of the whole plantation to be disturbed by one, of
                  whom he has the power to rid himself. This is a last appeal. Will you follow me to
                  your master, and promise hereafter to curb your rebel passions, proving yourself
                  worthy of his confidence and esteem? or will you be banished from the home where
                  you have so long been sheltered in kindness and affection?"</p>
               <p>"Take me to master—take me to master," said the melted and repentant negro; "let
                  him punish me any way he please—only let me stay—best master and mistress nigger
                  ever had in <emph>this</emph> world. Pray forgive poor Hannibal, mistress—he never
                  do so no more—never."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy lifted the lamp and left the room, beckoning him to follow. Looking
                  back with an angelic smile upon the black shadow rolling behind, she led the way
                  to the sitting-room, and opening the door, beckoned her husband to approach.</p>
               <p>"I have brought you a penitent," said she, "one sincerely convinced of his error,
                  and anxious for your forgiveness. I commend him to your mercy, firmly believing
                  this will be his last offence."</p>
               <p>Leaving her husband with the subdued General, she returned to her adopted
                  children, rejoicing in the success of her mission. That night, when she retired to
                  bed, and was about to drop the muslin curtains over the open windows, that the
                  night-air might come in mellowed through its folds, she heard the strains of a
                  violin directly beneath. Bending out, she discerned distinctly, by the sparkling
                  starlight, the tall, dark form of Hannibal, thus exercising a minstrel power, in
                  the solemn stillness of the evening. He was the Orpheus of Hickory Hill, who, if
                  he did not move the stones and trees, set all the black feet quivering whenever
                  his magic bow touched the resounding strings. That he had come this night, beneath
                  her window, to wake the tones of his beloved instrument, was a touching proof that
                  the evil spirit had indeed departed from him; and as she listened to the low,
                  plaintive melody, so different from his usual brisk, enlivening measures, a tear
                  glistened in her mild eyes.</p>
               <p>"Poor Hannibal," said she, "I wish I had another Cora for him. There is more depth
                  of feeling and passion in him than the handsome, smiling King. But she is not the
                  first woman who has been charmed by a showy exterior, nor will she be the
                  last."</p>
               <p>Long after she had sunk to rest, the wounded heart of Hannibal breathed its sorrow
                  and remorse, in the sweet complaining notes of his viol, while the midnight stars
                  gleamed with lonely lustre on his brow.</p>
               <p>The time for the departure of Marcus drew near. As he was to return during the
                  long holidays of the next summer, the separation would be comparatively short, and
                  there was no cause for grief at parting. But Aunt Milly and Katy wept bitterly,
                  notwithstanding the former imagined a college a kind of Pandemonium, where the
                  Evil Spirit held his gala days, and she tried to make Marcus promise to nail a
                  horse-shoe over his door, to keep off the witches. He must never look at the new
                  moon over his left shoulder, nor tell his dreams before breakfast, if they boded
                  evil. She gave him a little parcel, containing camphor, asafœtida, and the spirits
                  of turpentine, sewed tightly to prevent the charm from escaping; but as this would
                  not impart a very agreeable perfume to his wardrobe, with all due gratitude for
                  Aunt Milly's kindness, he took the liberty of casting aside the boasted amulet
                  against disease. The nice woollen socks which she had knit and Katy marked were
                  carefully preserved, as well as all the parting tokens of regard presented by Mr.
                  and Mrs. Bellamy. The latter encircled his finger with a gold ring, sparkling with
                  a ruby gem, when she bade him farewell.</p>
               <p>"You remember," she said, "in the eastern tale you read aloud to us the other
                  night, the ring which the genius Lyndaric gave to Amurath, whose warning pressure
                  reminded him, when he deviated from virtue and truth. Let this golden circle be to
                  you Lyndaric's magic ring. You recollect, when<pb n="70-71"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000035"/> the ruby turned pale, it was an indication of the
                  displeasure of the genius. If you are ever tempted into the paths of sin, though
                  your ruby gem may retain its lustre, imagine that my heart is fainting from the
                  disappointment of its fondest hopes; and remember, above all, my dear Marcus, that
                  a greater than Lyndaric has placed a monitor in your breast, whose warning voice,
                  if slighted, will turn to thunder in your ears."</p>
               <p>Marcus kissed the hand that gave the ring, with a heart too full for utterance,
                  and was turning away—</p>
               <p>"Not so, my son," said Mrs. Bellamy, folding her arms around him; "a mother's
                  fondest blessing rest upon you."</p>
               <p>Once more Marcus felt as if the heavens were opened, and the spirit of his
                  departed mother folded her wings over his heart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bellamy's parting gift was a gold watch. "Let this teach you the value of
                  time, my boy, so that you waste none of its diamond sparks. God bless you."</p>
               <p>Thus embalmed with blessings, and crowned with gifts, the tears of sweet Katy on
                  his cheeks, and the sobs of Aunt Milly still echoing in his ears, Marcus left
                  Hickory Hill, with the morning sun. He rode on horseback to the next town, to meet
                  the stage that was to bear him to the place of his destination. His father
                  accompanied him there, and a negro followed in a buggy, bearing his trunk. The
                  conversation of the father and son was full of earnest interest. Marcus thought of
                  their interview on the margin of the Long Moss Spring, and pure and deep as the
                  gush of its silvery waters was the gratitude that overflowed his heart, for the
                  blessings that had followed them since that sad and clouded hour.</p>
               <p>Towards the close of the second day's journey, the stage stopped at a blacksmith's
                  shop, that a broken tire might be repaired. Marcus was glad of the opportunity of
                  giving freedom to his limbs, and ran forward through the pine woods that shaded
                  all that portion of the country. Straight and symmetrical as the pillars of an
                  antique temple, the auburn-coloured trunks bore aloft their green and odorous
                  crests, meeting overhead, and forming a fretwork, such as man, with all his
                  boasted art, could never imitate. Marcus heard the music of a gushing spring,
                  gurgling over the rocks, and he hastened on, to bathe his thirsty lips in its
                  waters.</p>
               <p>"Oh!" thought he, "that I could see my own dear mossy spring! that I could behold
                  the long blue plumes curling so gracefully over the white limestone, and under the
                  clear waves!"</p>
               <p>There was a sudden turn in the road where the spring spouted, and Marcus started
                  back in astonishment, as he leaped forward to plunge his head into the basin. A
                  young girl sat upon a rock, just above the fountain, dipping a riding-whip in the
                  water, and flirting the drops about in a sportive manner. She was habited in an
                  equestrian garb, though no horse was near. A small hat, with black, drooping
                  feathers, sat jauntily on her head, and a long, dark riding-skirt, though drawn up
                  in many a fold, still almost touched the edge of the fountain. She looked up as
                  Marcus drew near, and discovered a face of singular brightness and expression. She
                  was a deep brunette, but a rich sunset glow lighted up the twilight of her cheeks,
                  and a smile, mischievous and even saucy, curled her red lip as she gazed on the
                  young intruder, as much as to say, "Who are you, sir, and how dare you come so
                  near <emph>my</emph> dominions?"</p>
               <p>"Have I permission to drink of the spring?" asked he, taking off his hat in
                  courtesy to the nymph of the fountain, who nodded her head haughtily, though the
                  same smile illumined her face. He knelt down on the rock, and bowed his head to
                  the gush of the waters. A sudden shower drenched his hair, while a wild burst of
                  laughter rang musically in his ear. The fair equestrian had amused herself, by
                  throwing up the water with her whip, and saturating the sunny locks that swept on
                  its surface.</p>
               <p>Emboldened by her mirth, Marcus shook the drops from his head, and asked her if
                  she was the fairy of the spring.</p>
               <p>"No," said she, laughing; "I am only a poor little maiden, who has lost her pony.
                  My saddle turned I jumped off; Fairy—(you see, I am greater than a fairy, for I
                  have one<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC6692-00000036"/> under my sway)—Fairy cut all
                  kinds of capers, and ran off, nobody knows whither. Haven't you seen a stray pony,
                  young gentleman, in your travels?"</p>
               <p>Marcus could not help smiling at the perfect nonchalance of the young girl, and at
                  the coolness with which she had seated herself, at that late hour of the day,
                  waiting for the recreant that might never return. He longed to offer his services,
                  to go in search of the stray animal, but the stage might come along during his
                  absence, and he be left in the wild woods, at the mercy of this gay but haughty
                  damsel. While he was explaining his situation, and regret at his inability to
                  offer his services as her knight, a negro approached, leading the meek and
                  penitent-looking pony, who came up to the side of its young mistress, with a look
                  of human sensibility, deprecating her anger.</p>
               <p>"Naughty Fairy," said she, fondly stroking its dark-brown mane; "shame on you to
                  leave your mistress in the lurch. You shall feed on dry bread and water till
                  morning to pay for it. No, I thank you, sir," said she, as Marcus eagerly held out
                  his hand to assist her to mount, bounding at the same time on its back, with the
                  lightness of a sylph; "I want no help. Pray, tell me the name of the brave knight
                  who was so willing to help me in my extremity."</p>
               <p>Marcus blushed deeply at this sarcastic speech, but he answered with becoming
                  spirit:—"My time is not my own, fair miss. Should I lose my passage and my trunk,
                  I should be in a sorry plight in these woods."</p>
               <p>"Oh, we could give you a thousand trunks for one," answered the proud little lady,
                  "and our house is large enough to entertain all the wandering squires in
                  Christendom. So, you will not tell me your name?" added she, with a look so soft
                  and womanly it was quite bewitching from contrast.</p>
               <p>"Most willingly," said Marcus, "hoping to receive the same favour from my fair
                  companion. I am called Marcus Warland, a name I hope to adorn with the highest
                  honours of the university to which I am bound."</p>
               <p>"Marcus Warland!" repeated she—and Marcus thought he had never heard his name
                  sound so sweetly before. "That does not sound badly. So, you are ambitious, it
                  seems."</p>
               <p>"Very—there are no bounds to my ambition. I feel as if I could dare all, and
                  attain all. But are you not going to return my courtesy, and tell me by what name
                  I may remember <emph>you?</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And who told you to remember me at all?" answered the wild brunette, putting her
                  foot in the stirrup, preparatory to flight. "You will forget me as soon as Fairy
                  plunges in these woods. Let me see. They call me Puss, Pet, Missy, and
                  Tom-boy—Dash and Lightning sometimes. You may take your choice. They are all
                  pretty and fanciful."</p>
               <p>"I should think Lightning the most appropriate," said Marcus, feeling the lambent
                  brightness of her glances playing on his face.</p>
               <p>"You talk very well for your age," she cried, with a serious air. "You can't be
                  more than sixteen, I am sure?"</p>
               <p>"You guess marvellously well," replied Marcus, laughing at her odd inquisitive
                  ways, though vexed that she would not gratify his own curiosity. The rumbling of
                  the stage was heard as it came thundering down the hill.</p>
               <p>"Good-bye, Master Marcus Warland," cried she, holding out her beautiful, ungloved
                  hand, with a mixture of bashful archness and haughty condescension, "when you win
                  all the blushing honours to which you are aspiring, may I be there to see and
                  admire."</p>
               <p>One cut of her slender whip on Fairy's flank, and Miss Lightning vanished from his
                  sight, leaving him so dazzled and bewildered by the unexpected encounter, that he
                  came near getting into the windows of the stage instead of the door.</p>
               <p>Marcus had met many grown ladies and young misses at Mrs. Bellamy's, and the
                  companionship of his refined and beautiful benefactress had given him an ease of
                  manners in the society of ladies seldom met with at the usually awkward and
                  doubtful era of his life. The remarkable beauty of his person,<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000037"/> combined with the frankness, spirit, and grace of
                  his deportment, made him a favourite wherever he went. The consciousness of being
                  able to please gave him a confidence that never overreached on the bounds of
                  modesty, and a gayety chastened by perfect good breeding. But there was something
                  so teasing, so baffling about this original brunette, so different from any one
                  whom he had ever met before, that it haunted him, and even in his dreams the dark
                  girl of the fountain pursued him, with her menacing little whip, and dashed the
                  spray over his uncovered head.</p>

               <p>CHRISTMAS was at hand—the great saturnalia of the South—when for seven days the
                  slave revels in all the joys of freedom, and, as in the ancient festivals
                  celebrated in honour of the father of the gods, the master and mistress act a
                  subordinate part. Whatever services are required during these gala days are
                  liberally rewarded, though they may be spontaneously offered. An unprejudiced
                  stranger, who wished to see some of the <emph>lights</emph> that illumine the
                  darkness of slavery, would rejoice in the opportunity of visiting Bellamy Place
                  while the holidays were infusing their gladdening influence through the whole
                  plantation.</p>
               <p>For two or three days previous, Mrs. Bellamy, assisted by the delighted Katy, was
                  assorting the presents she had prepared for all the household slaves. Those who
                  were called the field negroes were remembered by the bounty of the master, who
                  never assigned them a niggard boon. The gifts of Mrs. Bellamy generally consisted
                  of a handsome calico dress, a radiant handkerchief, and those little showy, fancy
                  articles that set off to advantage their shining and jetty skins. The little
                  negroes were allowed to hang up their stockings, sure that St. Nicholas would fill
                  them with sweet cakes and candy.</p>
               <p>It was the morning of the first day of Christmas week, and with the earliest faint
                  auroral streak merry voices were tumbling on the top of each other, and making the
                  house ring with "Christmas gift, master!" "Christmas gift, mistress!" When a
                  master and mistress so kind and liberal as Mr. and Mrs. Bellamy are thus aroused
                  from their slumbers, the gift-seekers are never sent empty away, but the ready
                  packets are tossed to the right owners, or a promise given that is faithfully
                  kept. But it is not the master and mistress alone who are thus honoured. Every
                  member of the house, whoever it may be, is saluted by the same greeting, and when
                  the white population are satisfied with the honours they have received, the
                  negroes run headlong against each other, repeating from the altitude of their
                  lungs the annual, unwearied cry of "Christmas gift!" Then follows the exulting
                  shout, "I've caught you!" with the climax of a laugh such as only a negro can send
                  out through the ivory portals of sound.</p>
               <p>The holidays were ushered in with unusual excitement, as the nuptials of King and
                  Cora were to be celebrated with all the brilliancy befitting such distinguished
                  personages. The marriage of the favourite household slave of a wealthy planter is
                  a circumstance of nearly as much interest as that of a son or daughter. Here were
                     <emph>two</emph> favourites, and of course preparations of unwonted
                  magnificence were made. Mr. Bellamy, at the time his own mansion was built, had
                  erected a large hall expressly for a dancing-room for his negroes, and every night
                  of the annual festival the animating strains of the violin winged the feet which
                  neither toil had stiffened nor slavery weighed down. The wedding of Cora was to be
                  succeeded by a ball, to which the negroes of the neighbouring plantations were
                  invited, and<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6692-00000038"/> for which invitations,
                  written by Katy in her fairest hand, had already been circulated.</p>
               <p>The only drawback to the hilarity of the occasion was the Carthaginian General.
                  Though he was apparently subdued by the mild influence of his mistress, and was
                  really so for the time, his passions were only slumbering. Like the chained
                  mastiff that guarded his master's yard, they had lost none of their strength, but
                  were ready to break loose and deal destruction around them. Following the counsels
                  of Mrs. Bellamy, Cora put aside her little, coquettish, triumphant airs, and
                  treated him with real kindness, but it seemed to have no effect on his dark and
                  sullen mood. Mrs. Bellamy did not express the apprehensions that filled her mind,
                  but she had a sad misgiving that something would happen to sadden the prospects of
                  the beautiful mulatto. Still her hands loved to adorn her with the bridal robes,
                  which enhanced, as they usually do, the natural beauty of the wearer. Cora's dress
                  and the ornaments that decorated it were the Christmas gifts of her mistress, and
                  many a fair bride of the race of snow would be proud to clothe herself in raiment
                  as tasteful and becoming. The transparent Swiss muslin frock, the glistening white
                  satin sash, the white blossoms that wreathed her jetty and braided hair, were all
                  that a fashionable belle could desire. Her coral necklace and bracelets contrasted
                  richly with the bright golden hue of her neck and arms; and deep and brilliant as
                  the coral glowing under the darkening wave was the colour that dyed her round and
                  dimpled cheeks.</p>
               <p>As she stood before her mistress in the beauty of her bridal attire, smiling under
                  her pleased and admiring gaze, a sudden sadness clouded her brow, and tears
                  gathered unbidden into her soft, black eyes.</p>
               <p>"I don't know what is the reason, mistress," said she, "but I feel so bad
                  to-night; I do think something is going to happen to me or King; I ve seen so many
                  bad signs lately."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Cora, you must not believe in signs," said Katy.</p>
               <p>"I can't help it, Miss Katy. I dreamed I was married last night, and that is a
                  sure sign of a funeral; and the owls have been hooting on an old tree back of the
                  kitchen for more than a week."</p>
               <p>"But you know there is a charm in a wedding-ring, Cora, that nothing can resist,
                  so you must hasten to put one on," said Mrs. Bellamy, in a reassuring tone.</p>
               <p>The ceremony was performed in a back sitting-room, which was decorated with holly
                  and pine boughs, so that it looked like an evergreen bower. King, who was worthy
                  of his royal name, would not have exchanged situations with Prince Albert, or any
                  other potentate of Europe; and the black retinue that surrounded this son and
                  daughter of Africa, whose paler complexions showed they approached a fairer race,
                  gazed upon them with as much admiration and deference as England's royal pair ever
                  inspired. But when the doors of the supper-room were thrown open, a frame building
                  contiguous to the ball-room, the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">coup d'œil</foreign> was
                  dazzling as a sunburst. The table was brilliantly lighted and adorned with all the
                  flowers a mild southern winter so liberally supplies. Cakes beautifully ornamented
                  and frosted as white as ivory, oranges, confectionaries, and all the luxuries that
                  are customary on such occasions, covered the board. These dainties were partly
                  supplied by Mrs. Bellamy and partly by the negroes themselves, who took a pride
                  and delight in appropriating some of their own earnings to adorn the
                  marriage-feast. Cora, who sought in vain among the wedding guests for the powerful
                  form and raven face of Hannibal, suffered her spirits to rebound from the weight
                  that had oppressed them, and gayly laughed and brightly blushed, and gave herself
                  fully to the enjoyment of woman's triumph hour. The transition from the supper to
                  the ball-room was followed by greater hilarity and more unrestrained freedom.
                  Wilder and wilder grew the mirth and excitement, till each fibre of every plank in
                  the floor seemed to quiver beneath the bounding, flying, crossing, pigeon-winged
                  feet that kept time to the quick, bewitching strains of the viol and the
                  tambourine. It was inspiring to look on the<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6692-00000039"
                  /> master of the last instrument; the way he rattled on the parchment was quite
                  supernatural. Shutting his eyes and opening his mouth, and throwing back his head,
                  his knuckles rang like brazen balls on the resounding instrument. Sometimes he
                  would rap it thunderingly with his head, then whirling it with inconceivable
                  rapidity to his feet, tap it with his heels and toes, then it would be dancing on
                  his elbows, like a thing of life and instinct. Not satisfied with this surpassing
                  display of agility, he would throw the tambourine on the floor, and whirling it
                  round with the end of his forefinger, its little bells would jingle like a New
                  England sleigh. All this time he seemed in a magnetic sleep, for it is
                  questionable whether he ever unclosed his eyes.</p>
               <p>King and Cora opened the ball with a grace that captivated every eye. Cora lightly
                  touched the folds of her full, falling skirt with the tip of her white gloves, and
                  put her pretty head on one side, as she had seen the white belles do in her
                  mistress's drawing-room, and King kept up a bowing and swaying motion that waved
                  the skirts of his coat to and fro, as well as the end of the white handkerchief
                  that hung elaborately from his pocket. During a pause in the reels, Dancing Jack,
                  as he was called far and near, took the centre of the floor and performed the
                     <emph>Virginia break-down,</emph> in a style that defies description. Each
                  separate joint and sinew danced, as if it were an individual self. If ever there
                  was an example of rapidly accelerating, apparently perpetual, unwearied motion, it
                  was exhibited by Dancing Jack. He became wild, frantic, superhuman, and finished
                  at last by an exulting leap, then giving his right heel a tremendous rap, stood as
                  if transformed to a black petrifaction. While Jack was enchanting his companions
                  by his unexampled achievement, Cora stole out to arrange her hair, which had
                  become disordered in the dance. As she passed out she saw a tall, dark figure
                  lurking near the door, which she immediately recognised as Hannibal. Though she
                  had a dread, amounting to horror, of her Herculean lover, she pitied his
                  unrequited requited attachment, and longed to address him some soothing words.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you come in and dance, General?" said she, "or play on your violin for
                  us? There's nobody can play like you."</p>
               <p>"I'm no Dancing Jack," he replied, gloomily, "and if you don't need me one way,
                  you needn't another. I wish you joy, Miss Cora; I hope you'll think of me, when
                  next Christmas come round again."</p>
               <p>"Thank you, Hannibal, to be sure I shall."</p>
               <p>Cora ran up-stairs into Mrs. Bellamy's room, which was unoccupied now, though a
                  bright fire was blazing in the chimney and a candle burning on a small stand near
                  the hearth. Cora went to the large mirror and arranged her shining hair. She
                  thought she saw the gloomy shadow of Hannibal behind her, and turned round once or
                  twice before she could remove the impression.</p>
               <p>"Poor fellow!" said she, still gazing on her own bright figure. "I do pity him. If
                  King loved anybody else, I should feel <emph>so</emph> bad. I really believe I
                  should poison myself. Now <emph>aint</emph> he handsome? and doesn't he look like
                  a rose among thorns? Oh, get along, Cora; how like a fool you do talk!"</p>
               <p>Cora's white teeth gleamed on the face of the mirror, then turning away she threw
                  herself into a large easy-chair in front of the fire, and in spite of the excited
                  state of her feelings and the extreme want of sentiment evinced by the act, she
                  fell asleep in her downy nest. She had been up almost all the preceding night, on
                  her feet all day, and had been dancing with such extraordinary enthusiasm, that
                  the soft cushion and gentle warmth of the room soothed her to instantaneous
                  repose. How long she slept she knew not. She was awakened by a sense of heat and
                  suffocation, as if her lungs were turned to fire. Starting up she found herself
                  encircled by a blaze of light, that seemed to emanate from her own body. Her light
                  dress was one sheet of flame, the chair she left was enveloped in the same
                  destroying element.</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC6692-00000040"/>
               <p>"Mercy! mercy!" she shrieked. "Oh! mistress, save me, save me." Rushing through
                  the hall and down the stairs, the flames flashing more wildly round her, she still
                  screamed, "Mistress, save me!" Mrs. Bellamy, who was in the room below, heard the
                  sudden terrible cry of human suffering, and flew to relieve it. When she beheld
                  the blazing figure leaping towards the open door, and recognised the voice of
                  Cora, shrill and piercing as it now was, regardless of self, she sprang after her,
                  and seizing her with frenzied grasp, tried to crush the flames with her slender
                  fingers, and smother them against her own body. While she was thus heroically
                  endeavouring to save the beautiful mulatto at the risk of her own life, Hannibal,
                  who had dragged the carpet from the hall, wrapped it closely round the form of her
                  he so madly loved; feeling even in that moment of horror a fierce transport that
                  he had anticipated the bridegroom in this act of preservation. The flames, which
                  were communicated to Mrs. Bellamy's dress, which being of black satin was not of
                  very inflammable materials, were smothered by the contact of the thick carpet.
                  Resigning Cora to the powerful arms of Hannibal, who bore her into the house, she
                  followed her, unconscious, in her intense excitement and anxiety, of the injury
                  she had herself sustained. Mr. Bellamy, who was looking into the ball-room when
                  Cora's wild cry summoned her mistress to her aid, met his wife on the threshold,
                  who, even while she held up her burnt and bleeding hands, exclaimed with white and
                  blistering lips:—</p>
               <p>"See to Cora. Oh! husband, look to her. I am not hurt."</p>
               <p>"My God! Isabel, those hands! What have you been doing?"</p>
               <p>"Cora is burned to death," she gasped, reeling against him as she spoke. "Think
                  not of me. Poor Cora!"</p>
               <p>While this self-sacrificing and heroic woman endeavoured to direct even her
                  husband's attention to the chief sufferer in this awful scene, Cora was surrounded
                  by a dense and bewailing crowd. She was not <emph>burned to death,</emph> as her
                  mistress had said, but death would have been a mercy to the life of suffering that
                  remained to her. Poor King! the late proud, happy, smiling bridegroom. He threw
                  himself by her side with frantic agony, sobbing and wringing his hands, and
                  calling piteously on her name. Hannibal stood near, making no loud demonstration
                  of grief, the big drops rolling silently down his cheeks. There was a lurid fire
                  in his eye when he looked at King, indicating a kind of savage joy in
                     <emph>his</emph> sufferings, mingled with his anguish for <emph>hers.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"I'll let him live now," muttered he to himself. "I 'fraid I would a killed him.
                  He suffer now, poor fellow. He suffer now, that he does."</p>
               <p>It was some time before Doctor Manning, the physician of the family, could reach
                  Hickory Hill, as he dwelt several miles distant. In the mean time, Aunt Milly, who
                  was famous for the cure of burns, took the poor girl under her care, and did all
                  she could for her relief by taking off the burned cinders of her dress, and
                  wrapping folds of cotton around her. She also wrapped up Mrs. Bellamy's bleeding
                  hands, while Katy stood sobbing by her side. It was a terrible winding up of the
                  bridal festivities. While Cora was nodding in the easy-chair, a portion of her
                  light dress had come in contact with the candle burning on the table, and she thus
                  became a blazing martyr to one moment's self-indulgence. She was fearing the dark
                  jealousy of Hannibal. She thought not of the winding-sheet of flame the hand of
                  destiny was weaving in exchange for her bridal robes. How seldom do the evils we
                  most dread roll down upon our souls! How often are we crushed by a sudden,
                  startling, unlooked-for weight of wo!</p>
               <p>It was past midnight before Doctor Manning arrived, whose arrival was anticipated
                  with unutterable anxiety. Mrs. Bellamy sat in an easy-chair by the couch on which
                  the moaning bride was laid. Her bandaged hands lay upon a pillow, and her pale
                  countenance was expressive of the deepest suffering.</p>
               <p>"Not me, doctor," said she, looking towards the couch; "attend to poor Cora first;
                  my sufferings are nothing to hers, nothing."</p>
               <pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6692-00000041"/>
               <p>Feeling the truth of her remark, while he honoured her disinterested compassion,
                  the doctor obeyed her, and turned to the patient, whose moans and cries indicated
                  a degree of pain which he feared his utmost skill would be unable to relieve. It
                  was a harrowing task to examine the extent of the injuries she had received, nor
                  was it possible for him to pronounce at once upon the probability of her recovery.
                  So strong was her solicitude to know his opinion of Cora's case, that Mrs.
                  Bella-my forgot her own, and fixed her eyes upon him with a look of earnest
                  inquiry. She saw that a cloud, deeper than seriousness, rested on his fine
                  countenance, and her heart failed.</p>
               <p>"You think her case very bad, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"She is, indeed, very badly, deeply burned."</p>
               <p>"But there is hope, doctor? You have cured such dreadful cases?"</p>
               <p>"I do not say that this <emph>is</emph> hopeless; and be assured all that I
                     <emph>can</emph> do shall be done to mitigate her sufferings and promote her
                  recovery. But, my dear madam, when are you going to let me see those hands of
                  yours you keep so carefully concealed?"</p>
               <p>"How willingly would I endure this, and far more, if by so doing I could purchase
                  the life of Cora!" said Mrs. Bellamy, while they unbound her smarting, raw, and
                  disfigured hands. But never in their native fairness, when uncovered and sparkling
                  with rings, had they been so worthy of admiration as at this moment, marred as
                  they were in her generous efforts to save the life of her slave. So Doctor Manning
                  thought, as with gentle touch and well-tried skill he applied the healing remedies
                  of his art to the sore and quivering flesh. He had a soul keenly susceptible of
                  the influence of moral beauty, and as his profession brought him within those
                  sanctuaries of the heart to which very few are admitted, he had an opportunity of
                  studying its most hidden pages.</p>
               <p>"Your scars will be more honourable than those of the warrior's, gained on the
                  battle-field," said he to Mrs. Bellamy, when he had dressed the martyred
                  members.</p>
               <p>"I do not deserve any praise, doctor. It was all instinctive."</p>
               <p>"But surely, the instinct of benevolence that induces one to peril her life
                  regardlessly for another, is more praiseworthy than the self-love that folds the
                  mantle of security over its own breast, believing that self-preservation is the
                  first great law of being."</p>
               <p>After administering an anodyne to both, the doctor took his leave, promising to
                  call the next day, or rather the same, for the dawn was already standing at the
                  gates of the orient. At the outer door he was stopped by the bridegroom, who could
                  scarcely articulate the question that trembled on his lips.</p>
               <p>"She won't die, doctor, will she? Cora won't die?" repeated he, hanging on his
                  words as if his own existence depended on the answer.</p>
               <p>"I hope not, my poor fellow," said the doctor, in a kind and sympathizing tone.
                  "It is impossible for me to say now what will be the result, but we will certainly
                  hope for the best. In the mean time, I will do all I can to restore her."</p>
               <p>"I know you will, doctor," said he, still detaining him. "They say you kill or
                  cure, just which you please. Promise to cure Cora, and I'll follow you on my knees
                  all my born days."</p>
               <p>"You must pray to God for her life, and that He will bless the means used for her
                  recovery; but you must not put <emph>me</emph> in the place of the Almighty," said
                  the doctor, gently drawing away from the despairing bridegroom, and riding from
                  the door.</p>
               <p>"Yes," mused the benevolent physician, as he went forth into the faint, chill
                  morning twilight; "the words this poor negro has uttered in his ignorance and
                  despair are but the echoed breathings of suffering humanity. In the hour of
                  physical anguish and impending bereavement, imploring Nature turns to
                     <emph>us,</emph> and prays us, in God's stead, to succour and to save. If our
                  feeble arm does arrest the stroke of the destroying angel, some grateful hearts
                  invoke Heaven's blessing on our head; but if human science be baffled, and
                  inexorable death claim his victim, then the frantic mourner cries, 'We might have
                  saved them if we would,' and the mocking cynic exclaims, when the hearse rolls
                  darkly on to the land of everlasting<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC6692-00000042"/>
                  lasting silence, 'There goes one of the doctor's patients to his long home.'
                  Verily, there are thorns among the roses that blossom on the wayside of our
                  existence."</p>
               <p>It is probable the reflections of Doctor Manning would not have assumed the
                  character they did, had he indulged any sanguine hopes of the recovery of his
                  patient. Days, even weeks passed away, and all his skill and kindness availed not.
                  Poor Cora's doom was sealed. Mrs. Bellamy had recovered the use of her hands, and
                  assisted in nursing the dying mulatto. So great and protracted had been her
                  sufferings, that even King was willing that she should die, rather than live
                  longer in hopeless anguish. At first Cora clung to life with strong, convulsive
                  grasp, and would entreat the doctor, with pitying accents, "Not to let her die,"
                  but gradually the convulsive grasp relaxed, the wild glance of despair melted into
                  the softness of tears, and she begged her mistress to pray that she might be made
                  willing to die. Holy were the prayers that went up by her bedside for the boon of
                  Christian resignation, and they were not breathed in vain. The same gentle hand
                  that had embraced the flames for her rescue led her, a trembling, but accepted
                  penitent, to the feet of her Saviour.</p>
               <p>It seemed as if the blazing element that had consumed the springs of her existence
                  was touched by the beauty of her face. No defacing mark was there, but her cheek
                  remained as smooth and transparent as when it blushed beneath the bridal kiss.
                  Just before she died, she turned her eyes in all their languishing brightness
                  towards her mistress, who bent over her to catch her faint, low accents.</p>
               <p>"Let me kiss once more the dear hands that suffered for me," said the expiring
                  mulatto; and her weeping mistress softly pressed her hand on the cold lips, once
                  red and bright as the coral of the ocean.</p>
               <p>There is a plain white slab in a green enclosure on Hickory Hill, sacred to the
                  memory of Cora. There are sweet flowers and shrubs blooming around it. The
                  mourning bridegroom of an hour planted a weeping-willow by its side, and many a
                  night, when the moon was shining on her grave, the tall, dark form of Hannibal
                  would wander to the spot, certain that he met there the spirit of Cora, and that
                  she looked kindly upon him. Indeed, all the negroes on the plantation saw her
                  ghost, and it was always dressed like a bride, in white muslin, white roses, and
                  white kid gloves.</p>
               <p>One incident connected with the history of the doomed bride should not be omitted
                  here.</p>
               <p>A short time after her death, Hannibal fell sick, and Doctor Manning was summoned
                  to his bedside. He had attended him the previous year during his illness, and
                  Hannibal had a grateful remembrance of his kindness and an unbounded admiration
                  for his skill.</p>
               <p>One night, when the General's fever was unusually high, and he began to have some
                  fears for his own safety, he requested to be left entirely alone with the
                  doctor.</p>
               <p>"Doctor," said he, "do you think I going to die this time?"</p>
               <p>"I hope not, General; you don't look like a dying man yet."</p>
               <p>"But I may die for all that, and I wants to tell you something, if you please,
                  Doctor, 'cause I knows I ought to confess it. 'Spose a man wants to kill a man,
                  and don't do it, taint murder; is it, doctor?"</p>
               <p>"If he would do it if he could, he commits murder in his heart, General."</p>
               <p>"O Lord," cried Hannibal, rolling his hot head from side to side on the bolster.
                  "O Lord, I would a killed King, if I could, 'fore poor Cora got burned to cinders;
                  I didn't think of nothing else, Doctor."</p>
               <p>"But you have repented since," said the doctor, trying to soothe the excited
                  conscience of his patient; "you would not do it now."</p>
               <p>"O Lord, no; I so sorry for him; I wouldn't hurt his little finger for him. I
                  repented ever since; I keep repenting long I live."</p>
               <p>"Then I doubt not you are forgiven by Him you have<pb n="86-87"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000043"/> offended. But keep quiet, General, or I never shall
                  be able to cure you."</p>
               <p>"I quiet now, I confess it, I make clean breast this time," said the negro,
                  submitting to the will of his medical adviser, whom he had invested for the time
                  with sacerdotal power.</p>
               <p>Hannibal recovered, and became the devoted friend of the widowed King.</p>

               <p>THE life of a youth in college is full of monotony. One day is an epitome of the
                  year. If he be ardent and ambitious; if his lip thirst for the dews of Castaly,
                  and his spirit for the groves of Academus, he may, like Marcus, forget the
                  realities of his condition, in the classic life of his mind. Such was his thirst
                  for knowledge, and the rapture with which he imbibed it, that it was a perennial
                  spring flowing inward and giving perpetual freshness and greenness to the
                  intellectual and moral region. He loved to embosom himself in the thick oaken wood
                  that surrounded the university; and while he felt the verdure of its eternal youth
                  in his own soul, he drank in the almost divine philosophy of Plato, and wandered
                  with him in shades deep and luxuriant as his own. If in his rambles he met some
                  bubbling spring, he found inspiration in its waters, by associating them with the
                  fountains of Parnassus and the virgin Castalidas, who drank of their waves.</p>
               <p>Had Marcus isolated himself from his fellow-students during their hours of
                  recreation, they might have envied his superiority; but he mingled in their sports
                  with such hearty good-will, that he soon exercised over them the same rare
                  personal influence he had done on others. Though his fellowship with all was kind
                  and courteous, there was only one with whom he had intimate and unreserved
                  communion. This was a youth, by the name of George Delaval, who, after Marcus had
                  been in college a few weeks, evidently sought him out by that principle of
                  elective affinity by which things entirely different are attracted towards each
                  other. Delaval was a gay, dashing, don't-care-for-any-thing kind of young man,
                  generous to prodigality, proud, and sometimes overbearing, but with a flow of
                  animal spirits that made him exceedingly popular as a social companion. That he
                  was very wealthy there was no doubt, for he spilled his money like grains of sand,
                  regardless where it fell. Knowing his reputed riches and proud though reckless
                  character, Marcus would never have manifested a desire for his acquaintance; but
                  when Delaval showed him the flattering distinction of seeking his society on many
                  occasions, Marcus, with the natural frankness and geniality of youth, opened his
                  heart to his advances, and soon conceived for him a warm attachment. He had never
                  forgot the brunette of the fountain, and in a moment of confidence he described
                  the meeting to Delaval, and his extreme desire to ascertain the name of the dark
                  little enchantress. Delaval seemed excessively amused by the description and the
                  impression she had made on the imagination of Marcus.</p>
               <p>"I dare say she is some bold little vixen, that would flirt her riding-whip over
                  your shoulders with as much grace as she splashed about the water, if she had a
                  chance," said Delaval. "I don't think I should like her at all. I have no taste
                  for these dark beauties; give me one of your fair, blue-eyed, gentle lassies, that
                  steal upon you as insensibly as the dawning light. I have no idea of ever being
                  taken by storm."</p>
               <p>Marcus could not help thinking of his gentle, violet-eyed<pb n="88-89"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000044"/> Katy, while listening to the description of
                  Delaval, whose flashing black eyes mocked the lustre and the hue of jet. He
                  frequently regretted afterward that he had mentioned the young incognita to his
                  friend, for Mademoiselle Lightning became his standing jest, and Marcus felt as if
                  he had wronged her, by exposing her to such light ridicule. He might never see her
                  again—indeed he feared he should not; but her image was traced on his memory, in
                  characters as vivid and thrilling as the lightning, whose name she had sportively
                  assumed.</p>
               <p>One evening, as he sat in the recitation-room, waiting for his turn to be called
                  up by the learned professor, and was carelessly turning over the leaves of a book
                  he had carried with him, a letter dropped to the floor. He took it up, supposing
                  it one from his sister that he had accidentally left there, for he perceived that
                  the direction was in a fair, feminine hand; but upon nearer inspection he saw that
                  a stranger must have traced it, and the paper was of a most delicate, transparent
                  tissue, scented with the attar of roses. He looked at the seal, whose device was a
                  kneeling figure, with lightning darting from a cloud into its breast; the motto,
                     <foreign xml:lang="ITA">La Lampeggia degli occhi.</foreign> With kindling
                  curiosity he opened the envelope, and glancing at the signature, beheld the single
                  word, "Lightning." With a burning blush he folded it hastily, and concealed it
                  again within the leaves of his book, reserving its perusal for the solitude of the
                  thicket. Delaval, who had observed the fallen note, the deep blush, and hurried
                  concealment of the paper, rallied him the moment he had left the recitation room,
                  and insisted upon seeing the mysterious envelope.</p>
               <p>"Acknowledge, Delaval," said he, "that it is a practical joke of your own, and I
                  will forgive you. You must have written this yourself to impose on my credulity,
                  though I acknowledge you are a greater master of penmanship than I ever imagined
                  you." Marcus here exhibited the beautiful and fairy-like superscription of the
                  letter, and again repeated to Delaval his awakened suspicion.</p>
               <p>"No, Warland," replied Delaval, in a more serious tone than he usually used, "I
                  never wrote that letter. I may sport in words to amuse a passing moment; but I
                  think you ought to know me better than to suppose I would be guilty of such a
                  silly girl's trick as you accuse me of."</p>
               <p>"Nay, be not angry," said Marcus. "We college boys do so many foolish things, we
                  ought never to be offended at any charge. It is certainly very mysterious, very
                  surprising. I never mentioned her to any one but yourself. How it came within the
                  leaves of my book I cannot divine; unless," he added, "if you did not write the
                  letter, you acted the part of the carrier-dove, and dropped it from your wings
                  into my book. I am sure it is a very innocent jest, and I forgive you for it."</p>
               <p>"I will accept your forgiveness when I have earned it, Warland, by playing the
                  foolish part you see fit to have assigned me," answered Delaval, in a somewhat
                  haughty and offended tone; "you must think yourself of more consequence than you
                  are authorized, to imagine that <emph>I</emph> should trouble myself about such a
                  wild-goose fancy. Is it what you would expect from me, Warland?"</p>
               <p>"No, Delaval," answered Marcus, with a candid blush; "I must again ask you to
                  excuse my charging you with an office so idle, on the plea of my extreme
                  bewilderment. I am convinced now, that <emph>you</emph> have had nothing to do
                  with it; then who could have been the bearer?"</p>
               <p>"Well, Warland, if you are a brilliant scholar and a blithe companion, you are
                  withal the most stupid fellow I ever beheld, to prate about the why and the how
                  the letter of a young lady came into your possession, without having interest
                  enough to peruse its contents. If I were the favoured mortal, I should have torn
                  the paper into inch pieces before this, in my fiery impatience."</p>
               <p>"Its contents are sacred, whatever they may be, from boyish levity. You will
                  excuse me for reading them alone." The accents of grave rebuke that fell from the
                  lips of Marcus were drowned in the gush of laughter that followed them, from his
                  wild companion. Plunging into the thickest part of the<pb n="90-91"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000045"/> grove, and feeling himself alone with nature, he
                  unfolded again the mysterious letter, and no longer doubted its genuineness.</p>

                              peaks of literature, nor stop till I reached the sun-clad summit of
                              Mont Blanc. No yawning chasms beneath could appal me—no glacial
                              heights above deter me from ascending. Thou wilt win the highest
                              honours offered to the candidate of classic fame. Aspiring youth!—who
                              can dare all, and attain all. Such is thy own bold language. But
                              knowest thou not, that there are some things beyond the reach of human
                              ambition, all lofty and glorious as it is? Canst thou catch the
                              lightning's chain, and imprison it in thy grasp, even when it plays
                              around thy fingers, and scintillates before thine eyes? Thou wonderest
                              why I address thee. Thou wonderest how these random rays have glanced
                              into the pages of thy book. Seek not to know, for thou canst not
                              discover. As well mightest thou attempt to separate the drops I
                              scattered over thy hyacinthine locks from the waters of the fountain;
                              as well mightest thou seek to stay the vanishing tints of the rainbow,
                              when the cloud fades away, as to tell whence I come, and whither I go.
                              Press on, Marcus Warland, with thine eye steadfastly fixed on those
                              victorious honours thou so proudly claimest; and though perchance
                              invisible to thee, I shall be there to behold thee when they twine the
                              laurel garland round thy brow.</p>

               <p>Spellbound over the magic lines, which he again and again perused, the boy sat,
                  unconscious of the sinking of the sun or the gathering of the night-shades. The
                  letter was from her, the electric girl of the fountain, for to no one but her had
                  he uttered the presumptuous words, "He could dare all, and attain all." To no one
                  but her had he boasted of the prize he was resolved to win. She had remembered
                  him—she had winged her thoughts to him, how he knew not—either by the sunbeams of
                  heaven or the spirits of the air, or by some invisible wire strung from her heart
                  to his. A mantling glow of delight suffused his whole being. There was a romance,
                  a mystery in the matter that charmed and excited him. She was henceforth the
                  Egeria of his destiny, who was to lead him on to glory and renown. He placed the
                  letter in his bosom, where it was warmed by the pulsations of his quickened heart;
                  and warned by the loud ringing of the bell, returned to his lodgings.</p>
               <p>"Well, do you think I am the father of that precious morceau now?" asked Delaval,
                  in a mocking voice.</p>
               <p>"No, I do not, Delaval. It is impossible you should have written it."</p>
               <p>"You will, of course, indulge me with a perusal," added Delaval, holding out his
                  hand with a careless confidence that the request would be granted.</p>
               <p>"Though there is nothing in the letter that an angel might not have penned, the
                  lines traced by a female hand, when the motive seems as pure as actuates the
                  writer of these, should be sacred from the gaze of curiosity. Even if it be mere
                  girlish whim, as doubtless it is, in my keeping it should be considered holy."</p>
               <p>"You are right, Warland. You have the true spirit of a knight. Why, what an
                  admirable Crichton you are! The vaunted Scot revives again in you."</p>
               <p>"I have no desire to emulate his fame," said Marcus, "to have the bale-fire of
                  envy scorching my two clustering laurels, and to perish at last by the dagger of
                  the midnight assassin."</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6692-00000046"/>
               <p>"You <emph>are</emph> a second Crichton," persisted Delaval, "and I have no doubt
                  you will be poniarded one of these days. You had better wear a coat of mail under
                  your garments."</p>
               <p>"I will, if it will shield me from the shafts of ridicule," answered Marcus, with
                  rising anger.</p>
               <p>"Ridicule!" exclaimed Delaval, grasping his hand and shaking it vehemently. "By
                  the shade of Cicero, I never was more serious in my life. You have the prospect of
                  making a great many enemies; but as true as there is a silver moon in yonder sky,
                  you have one true and sincere friend."</p>
               <p>Marcus believed so. It was impossible to doubt the truth of Delaval, when he spoke
                  with seriousness. Marcus was morbidly sensitive to the idea of flattery. He could
                  not bear to be complimented on his personal beauty. He courted the tanning sun and
                  the darkening wind, but his cheek <emph>would</emph> be fair. He tried to keep
                  down the rich waves of his curling hair, but they <emph>would</emph> wander around
                  his brow. Some ventured to call him the "Lady of the College," as they did Milton
                  in former days, who was also distinguished for the sunny rimples of his flowing
                  locks. Once, as he was passing through the grove, he heard a jesting voice behind
                  the trees, address him by this, to him, unspeakably odious title. The dazzling
                  defiance of the eye, the breathing scorn of the lip warned the offender that man's
                  proudest, loftiest spirit dwelt in that youthful bosom; and that he could not be
                  insulted with impunity, as his athletic feats in the gymnasium well showed.</p>
               <p>It was a great mortification to Marcus that he could not answer the letter of the
                  young incognita. He knew not to whom or where to address a reply; and baffled on
                  every side, he chafed with impatience under a mystery he could not unravel. But
                  though he could not address his excited thoughts to her who was now the
                  inspiration of his ambitious hopes, he threw them on paper, in the solitude of his
                  room, in glowing prose, or reckless numbers. One evening, after a most magnificent
                  thunder-shower, he seized his pen and wrote the following lines:—<q>
                     <lg type="stanza">

                        <l>'Tis but to grasp the electric flame,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Throwing down his pen and extinguishing his light, he sat in the window till a
                  late hour, watching the play of the electricity on the retreating vapours,
                  flashing from cloud to cloud like fiery shuttlecocks tossed by invisible hands
                  across the firmament. It was not till after his hurried return from prayers the
                  following morning, that he remembered the impassioned strains he had left upon the
                  table. He looked for them, but they were gone. He turned every book upside down
                  and fluttered every leaf, but in vain. He emptied his portfolio, but with no
                  better success. The same invisible hand that had borne him the mysterious letter
                  had probably spirited away his bold stanzas. For one moment he was tempted to
                  believe in the supernatural, and that the dark, bright nymph of the fountain was
                  really embodied lightning, who made the clouds her chariot, and whose steeds were
                  the wings of the wind.</p>
               <p>It was not till after his return from Bellamy Place, where he passed the summer
                  vacation, that he heard again from the incognita. In the delight of meeting once
                  more his beloved benefactors, his lovely sister, and faithful nurse, he had
                  thought less of his romantic correspondent; and even on his return her image was
                  secondary in his mind. He was not to visit Bellamy Place again till his
                  graduation, when Mr. and Mrs. Bellamy, accompanied by Katy, were to come
                  themselves, to escort him home. Marcus had not forgotten the ruby ring, the
                     parting<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6692-00000047"/> gift of his benefactress; and
                  not a day passed that he did not gaze upon its sparkling crimson, and renew the
                  vow he had breathed in the ferryman's hut and on the margin of the Long Moss
                  Spring.</p>
               <p>The morning after his arrival, as he approached the table, where many a ponderous
                  tome was laid, he perceived the fragrance of roses in the atmosphere, and looking
                  down beheld the same delicate tissue directed to him by the same fairy hand. This
                  time the device on the seal was an eagle grasping a thunderbolt in its talons, the
                  motto, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">Je vaincs ou je meurs.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>"I wrote for the amusement of an idle hour," resumed the singular sprite. "I wrote
                  because the bold promptings of your ambition corresponded so well to the eagle
                  flights of my own wild spirit. I did not think you were weak enough to prate about
                     <emph>love,</emph> that silly jest of the school-boy, that time-worn theme of
                  the brain-sick bard. You have taught me my folly in supposing you above the rest
                  of your kind. Climb the mountain steep, twine the laurels round your brow, but
                  beware of that electric flame your rash hands would vainly grasp. Farewell; this
                  is the last time the nymph of the fountain will breathe her accents in your ear.
                  The wild impulse that guided her pen may be deemed bold and unfeminine by those
                  who understand her not.</p>

               <p>This was indeed her last communication. In vain he poured out his soul in flowing
                  numbers and in flashing sentences; no fairy messenger bore them to her who
                  inspired; no rose-scented scented epistles hereafter diffused around his room the
                  balmy breath of Paradise.</p>
               <p>The time drew near when the honours of graduation were to be distributed, and when
                  it was announced that Marcus had won the <emph>first,</emph> the intelligence was
                  received with acclamations. The second was awarded to Delaval, whose popularity
                  was manifested in a similar manner. Marcus was not elated by his success—a success
                  so easily attained. He felt within him capabilities to win so much more exalted
                  honours, that this seemed but boy's sport to him. Still, when Mr. and Mrs. Bellamy
                  arrived, and warmly congratulated him and Katy, now a most lovely and interesting
                  girl of seventeen years, with a cheek fair as the magnolia's waxen petals, and
                  eyes whose modest violets still sought the ground, but looked up to him with such
                  rejoicing pride, he could not but exult a little for their sakes in the
                  distinction allotted him.</p>
               <p>Delaval, too generous to cherish envy, was perfectly satisfied with the position
                  assigned to himself, and certainly divided with Marcus the laurels of the day.</p>
               <p>The night before commencement, while Delaval was sitting with Marcus and his
                  friends, enlivening them with his gay and graceful nonsense, he was called out by
                  a servant. Returning to make his apology for departing, he said to Marcus at the
                  door:</p>
               <p>"Some friends of mine are arrived. Distant acquaintances, perhaps, still they
                  claim some politeness from me, and I may not see you till we meet before the
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Professores illustrissimi, doctissimi,</foreign> who
                  are to sit sublimely round us, with their black robes and solemn faces."</p>
               <p>Marcus, whose part being first in honour, was last in time, felt at leisure to
                  survey the throng that had gathered in the hall, till it was crowded to
                  overflowing. Amid the brilliant array of beauty that beamed upon his gaze, the
                  pure, sweet face of his sister shone with transcendent loveliness. Dressed in
                  unadorned white, the fitting attire of virgin innocence, she sought no eye but her
                  brother's, though many an admiring glance was levelled at her.</p>
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6692-00000048"/>
               <p>"<emph>She</emph> is not here," said Marcus to himself, "that strange, capricious
                  being, who for a while made me her plaything. I am glad of it. She might perchance
                  talk to me even as she wrote, to beguile an idle hour; and if I presumed to
                  measure with her her own bright weapons, she would curl her saucy lips, wave her
                  haughty hand, and remind me of the reverence due to her imperial little
                  highness."</p>
               <p>Why did Marcus arrest these rather ungrateful thoughts, and bend forward with a
                  quickened pulse and a heightened colour? The crowd fell back from the door, and
                  leaning on the arm of a very dignified gentleman, appeared the brunette of the
                  fountain—the capricious incognita—the fairy of the pen. He recognised at one
                  glance, the dark, resplendent countenance of the embodied <hi rend="i"/>Lightning,
                  and so great was his excitement, that had it been his turn to speak, he could not
                  have uttered one syllable. She looked taller and less slight, though not above the
                  medium height, and her whole costume exhibited the exuberance of wealth and the
                  redundance of fashion. There was a sparkling of jewelry about her neck and arms
                  that reminded one of the starry adornments of evening, and a glitter of black,
                  shining ringlets on her cheeks and shoulders that threw back the sunbeams which
                  followed in her track as she moved from the door. Delaval had just risen to make
                  the salutatory address as this brilliant vision passed along, and had scarcely
                  made his low obeisance to the various dignitaries of the college when she took her
                  seat. Marcus noticed that her eye was eagerly turned towards the speaker, and that
                  she said something to her dignified companion, which also directed
                     <emph>his</emph> attention to Delaval, and that they both listened with marked
                  attention to his animated elocution. The only thing that gave to the face of
                  Delaval the character of beauty, was a pair of very expressive black eyes; and he
                  did not excel in those light graces of oratory which captivate the stranger's eye.
                  His oration, though written in pure and beautiful Latin, Marcus hardly supposed
                  Mademoiselle Lightning could understand. Yet, it was evident she was pleased with
                  his appearance, interested in his oratory, and when he concluded, an approving
                  smile irradiated her countenance. Had she seen and recognised himself? Once he
                  thought he felt her eyebeams burning on his own, and that a mocking smile flitted
                  across her lips. Then she turned to the window near which she was seated, and
                  played with the leaves that fluttered against her ringlets. Marcus by this time
                  had recovered from the dazzling effect of this apparition, and resolved not to
                  oppress her by the fixedness of his gaze. Should she meet him with haughtiness and
                  repulsion, he could be as haughty and repelling as herself. He was not blinded by
                  her wealth, nor awed by her state, nor would he be wounded by her caprice. What
                  kind of recognition Marcus expected it would be difficult to tell. He could not be
                  envious of the interest the very spirited and manly oration of Delaval had
                  elicited from her. He was incapable of the meanness of envy. Was it jealousy? Very
                  lofty and noble minds are sometimes misguided by its influence, and injustice is
                  sure to follow in its train. When the exercises were suspended at noon he lost
                  sight of her, while he sought his sister, who sat in another part of the hall. But
                  while walking through the grove towards the president's house, where Mr. and Mrs.
                  Bellamy were invited to dine, he saw his incognita considerably in advance, in
                  company with her tall guardian, and Delaval was walking on the other side of her,
                  evidently engaged in earnest conversation. How eagerly had he sought an
                  introduction! how favourably had he been received! Remembering what he had said
                  for his indifference to dark beauties, and his admiration for blondes, he could
                  not help thinking that his own fair sister would be more likely to captivate his
                  imagination than this dark-haired maiden.</p>
               <p>During dinner he heard merry remarks made upon the bright young stranger, but no
                  one seemed to know her name or locality. He also heard many encomiums passed on
                  the talents and elocution of Delaval, which, in spite of the little twinge of
                  jealousy he had caused, gave him sincere and heartfelt pleasure.</p>
               <pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC6692-00000049"/>
               <p>When they returned to the hall in the evening, Marcus beheld <hi rend="i"
                  />Lightning (for thus he was constrained to call her) already seated by the same
                  window, whose shade-tree made beautiful lattice-work over the casement. She sat
                  apart from the other ladies, evidently a stranger to all, and as evidently wishing
                  to remain so. Once more he met her recognising glance, illumined by the same
                  bright, haughty smile, and again the light leaves were broken off recklessly, and
                  strewed upon the window-sill.</p>
               <p>Before the commencement of the exercises, while the band was playing the inspiring
                  national air of "Hail Columbia," Delaval came upon the platform and seated himself
                  at his side.</p>
               <p>"Why, Warland, Marcus Warland," said he, in his lowest tone, "do you not recognise
                  your mysterious friend? Why have you not sought her, and acknowledged the signal
                  honours she has conferred upon you?"</p>
               <p>"I am sure you have more than supplied my place by the eagerness with which you
                  have claimed an introduction, and ingratiated yourself in her favour."</p>
               <p>"Now, Marcus Warland, don't be jealous of me, I pray you. I knew this fair damsel
                  before, and am only renewing an old acquaintance."</p>
               <p>"You knew her, Delaval? Why was this kept so secret from me? It seems very
                  inconsistent with your usual frankness."</p>
               <p>"How, in the name of wonder, could I identify the enchantress of the fountain,
                  whom you depicted in such oriental tints, with this very clever, but not at all
                  beautiful brunette? And how could I be aware of her freak of calling herself by
                  the odd name of Lightning?"</p>
               <p>"How, indeed," said Marcus, laughing, and relieved by the frank, natural manner of
                  Delaval. "I hope you will give me an introduction after we receive our diplomas,
                  or rather <emph>her,</emph> for she has the advantage of me, and knows me by my
                  proper patronymic already. What is her real name?"</p>
               <p>"It is the most ridiculous thing in the world," cried Delaval, "but the little
                  witch has made me promise not to reveal her real name, and to introduce her by the
                  strange soubriquet she has assumed. Only, with another of her unaccountable whims,
                  she has Frenchified it to <foreign xml:lang="FRA">L'éclair, le nom
                     François</foreign> for Lightning. She is the most original, arbitrary, and
                  self-willed of human beings; of this I give you fair warning. Accustomed to rule
                  every one that comes within the circle of her influence, she is despotic as the
                  autocrat of Russia. You will meet her at the ball to-night, given in honour of our
                  illustrious class, where she and your beautiful sister will represent the
                  brilliant night and fair aurora of the South."</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> do not seem to have bowed to her arbitrary sway yet?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed; I am too fond of dominion myself. I have told you of my belle ideal,
                  and it does not resemble her. Do not, however, imagine that I think her destitute
                  of fine qualities, because I speak frankly of her faults. She is generous,
                  warm-hearted, and, I should think, capable of great sacrifice for those she
                  loves."</p>
               <p>The serious tone in which the last words were uttered, and the look of deep
                  interest he cast towards the young brunette, who was sitting in an attitude of
                  careless, inimitable grace, convinced Marcus that he felt for her a far greater
                  admiration than he was willing to avow. The conversation ceased, for the youthful
                  candidates for fame were already on the floor, in all the artificial glow of a
                  forensic disputation. At length, all had performed their allotted parts but he who
                  wore the crowning honour of the day. Marcus was not bashful, but he was modest. He
                  had too much self-reliance to have a dread of failure, but the audible murmur of
                  admiration that followed his graceful salutation brought the rushing blood to his
                  cheek and bent his glances momentarily downward. The full, black, flowing silk
                  robes of the students invested their persons with a kind of Roman dignity and
                  grace while they were speaking, which their usual dress could not impart. Marcus,
                  who was now nineteen, had the full height and proportions of manhood, and
                  notwithstanding the fairness of his complexion and the almost girlish profusion of
                  his sunbright hair, there was an air of<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC6692-00000050"/>
                  manliness and resolution, an expression of great mental power, combined with the
                  warmth of latent passion breathing in his face, that redeemed it at once from the
                  charge of effeminacy. He had that greatest of all charms in an orator, perhaps it
                  might be said in <emph>any</emph> man or woman, a full, clear, sweet, and mellow
                  voice, more deep than loud, and whose lowest tones could be distinctly heard in
                  the remotest corner of the hall. Marcus felt that the approving, glistening eyes
                  of his beloved benefactress and his revered benefactor were resting upon him; that
                  his sister was gazing upon him with love and pride; that the venerable president
                  and learned professors were bending upon him looks of beaming approbation. He felt
                  all this, for his mind was clear from embarrassment, and he took in the scene, of
                  which he was now the centre, in all its length and breadth and bearings. But there
                  was something he felt even more. There was one face, that, like a burning-glass,
                  seemed to draw all the rays of thought, all the emanations of feeling; and the
                  figure to which that face belonged might have sat as a model to the statuary who
                  wished to personify the genius of attention. Yes, the spell was upon her. With her
                  head slightly raised, the wild foliage of her ringlets swept back from her brow,
                  and the crimson bloom of excitement on her cheek, she followed every word of the
                  youthful and inspiring orator, from his graceful exordium to the close of his
                  splendid effort, in the midst of the most enthusiastic and reiterated bursts of
                  applause. Marcus withdrew from the forum, but just as he was making his last bow,
                  a hand, unseen in the dense crowd, threw a chaplet of evergreen at his feet.
                  Bending down he raised this classic token of victorious honour, and twining it
                  round his arm, instead of wreathing with it his glowing brow, he disappeared from
                  the gaze of the audience. So signal a triumph had never been won in the walls of
                  the university; and after the parchments were all distributed, and the students
                  dismissed, his classmates gathered round him, and with the generous enthusiasm of
                  youth, warmly congratulated him on his well-earned fame. Delaval, giving his hand
                  a real <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tourniquet</foreign> squeeze, declared he was a
                  "glorious fellow," and "an honour to the South." "And take my advice, Warland,"
                  added he, confidentially, "glorify yourself a little, and if a certain young witch
                  should put on any airs to-night, deport yourself right royally; let her feel that
                  you know your own value."</p>
               <p>"He certainly feels a deep interest in that quarter," thought Marcus, but he said
                  nothing. The sun was then but a crimson are on the horizon, and he required rest
                  before the hilarity of the evening commenced. The day had been sultry and
                  oppressive, even in the open air, much more so in the crowded walls he had just
                  quitted. But as usual in southern latitudes, a soft, cool breeze came stealing
                  over the dewy grass, reviving the languid spirit, and preparing it for new
                  enjoyment.</p>
               <p>Marcus was emphatically the lion of the night, and whatever higher distinctions he
                  attained in after life, he certainly looked back to this evening as the most
                  brilliant epoch of his youth. He was not vain or elated. He has arrived at no
                  eminence he had not fully expected to attain, for he had a full, rejoicing
                  consciousness of his own powers, and he knew, if he kept them free from pollution,
                  and healthy and vigorous from exercise, they were capable of any exertion he would
                  be called upon to make. From earliest childhood, when asked if he could do any
                  thing, the ready, unhesitating answer was, "I can." And the earnest purpose, the
                  brave resolve, the firm yet modest confidence, were expressed in every feature of
                  his face, in every movement of his form. It was this invincible self-reliance,
                  this soul-felt strength, that gave an energy, a vitality and living warmth to his
                  character, and diffused around him an atmosphere of light and joy. Never had
                  Marcus known but one hour of despair, and that was the morning after his father's
                  perjury, when he bowed his young head over the <hi rend="i"/>Long Moss Spring, and
                  mingled his bitter tears with its waters. And then, when that father came, and,
                  sitting down by him in penitence and humiliation, told him of his heaven-appointed
                  mission, the magic words "<emph>I can—I will,</emph>" rang like an ancient war-cry
                  of victory in his ears, and led him on to a<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000051"/> triumphant future. The girl of the fountain had
                  cast a bewildering influence over him, and for a little while he doubted his own
                  power over elements so strange and apparently inharmonious as hers; but now, since
                  he had seen <emph>her</emph> mind magnetized by <emph>his,</emph> swaying in his
                  breath of eloquence, as the leafy branch in the rushing wind, when he repeated to
                  himself the interrogation she herself had made, "Canst thou seize the lightning's
                  chain, and imprison it in thy grasp?"—he could answer with the same conquering,
                  unconquerable resolution, "I can—I will." L'éclair sat at the upper end of the
                  hall, in the full blaze of the chandelier, and she well represented the night of
                  "starry climes and cloudless skies." The style of her dress was more juvenile than
                  that she had worn during the day, though more showy than the maidens that
                  surrounded her. It was of some exquisitely-transparent texture, while the
                  brilliant rubies on her neck and arms suited well the rich darkness of her
                  complexion. Marcus immediately approached her, and requested her hand for the
                  opening dance. He asked it with a smiling assurance of welcome, and certainly was
                  not repulsed. So quickly the music commenced, and they were called upon to take
                  their places on the floor, there was no embarrassing pause, after the first frank
                  greeting. The head of the dance was yielded to Marcus, as a compliment to one
                  whose initials were traced in green leaves, within an oaken garland, on the wall.
                  Marcus excelled in the graceful art of dancing, and no nymph of the wood, no naiad
                  of the stream, no muse of Parnassian bowers, ever possessed more of the music, the
                  poetry, the eloquence of motion, than the wild and spirited L'éclair. Her
                  movements seemed to flow into each other, like the moonlight waves, gently,
                  undulatingly; yet one felt when gazing, that there was a bounding will, a latent
                  strength, like those waves when driven by the storm. The same figure, that moved
                  with such measured grace, obeying the mandates of music, might spring like the
                  antelope, and fly like the deer, in the freedom of the forest and the plain.</p>
               <p>When they stood at the foot of the dance, while the band kept up their
                  exhilarating strains, Marcus turned to his partner, who, instead of panting with
                  flushed cheeks, as most of the young maidens did after their flight through the
                  hall, appeared as calm and unwearied as a bird just lighted on a spray.</p>
               <p>"Now let me thank you for the honour you have conferred upon me," said he—"an
                  honour, I assure you, that has not been lightly prized."</p>
               <p>"How can you consider that an honour," she carelessly answered, "which I should
                  have been obliged to bestow on any young gentleman in the room, who first
                  requested it?"</p>
               <p>"I do not allude to the dance. I do not consider that in the light of an
                     <emph>honour,</emph> but a <emph>pleasure.</emph> No young lady would have
                  refused my hand; so if there be any <emph>honour,</emph> it is conferred on her
                  who was selected first, in a group so fair as this."</p>
               <p>"Really, fair sir, you seem to appreciate your attentions very highly. Do you
                  imagine others attach to them the same value?"</p>
               <p>"I think you would have been disappointed, if I had not sought the earliest
                  opportunity of acknowledging my obligations to the inspiring genius of the
                  fountain, to her who writes with the lightning's pen, and makes viewless
                  messengers the vassals of her will."</p>
               <p>"Thanks are oppressive when unmerited and undesired," she replied, assuming an air
                  of haughty reserve. "You owe me no gratitude, for allowing me to make you the
                  plaything of a reckless mood, in an hour of ennui and idleness."</p>
               <p>"Believe me, bright L'éclair, you have found no plaything in me," answered Marcus,
                  with a proud smile. "Young as I am, and little versed in the wiles and caprices of
                  woman, I can parry her keenest weapons, and foil her most covert attacks."
                  L'éclair turned quickly, and fixed her dazzling eyes upon his face, with a look of
                  unutterable astonishment. He met it with such calm and radiant intensity, that,
                  baffled and disconcerted, she exclaimed in a tone of vexation, "You are indeed an
                  enigma. Give me the clue, if you please, to the intricate labyrinth of your
                  mind."</p>
               <p>"I will, for it is a very simple one—Truth."</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6692-00000052"/>
               <p>"Who ever heard of a young man speaking of <emph>truth</emph> to a girl?"</p>
               <p>"Who ever heard of a young girl requiring a key to the thoughts of one as frank
                  and ingenuous as myself?"</p>
               <p>"Well, I am going to test your frankness. Do you not think me very bold?"</p>
               <p>"Shall I tell you what I think of you, without fear of giving displeasure, even if
                  it be an affirmative to your singular question?"</p>
               <p>"Certainly; I should like exceedingly to know your opinion of me, though it is a
                  matter of perfect indifference what it is."</p>
               <p>"Is it? Then I shall not tell you."</p>
               <p>"Really!" she cried, with a smile of inconceivable brightness; "I do think I have
                  found a spirit as haughty and unmanageable as my own. Well then, victor orator of
                  the day and most provokingly self-sufficient young man, I do care to know what you
                  think of me, good, bad, or indifferent."</p>
               <p>"Let us sit down by the pine boughs that luxuriate in this corner of the room,
                  leaving the floor for the present to others. You have given me a long task to
                  perform."</p>
               <p>With an assenting motion, she suffered Marcus to lead her to the mimic bower,
                  where, with mock gravity on her brow and arch defiance on her lips, she waited his
                  exposition of her character.</p>
               <p>"I need not tell you that you are young, beautiful, and fascinating," began
                  Marcus, with an air of graceful seriousness. "<emph>That</emph> you know but too
                  well already. That you have wit and genius you also know, and are fully aware of
                  their dazzling power. Added to these lavish gifts of nature, you have the splendid
                  endowments of wealth, which in the eyes of the world would gild with transcendent
                  brightness far meaner charms. These are the brilliant lights of the picture—now
                  for its counter shades."</p>
               <p>"Yes! give me the shades. I have listened with impatience to an enumeration of
                  advantages too highly coloured for the sober truth you promised."</p>
               <p>"Nay, mysterious damsel, no tint that ever glowed on the palette of the artist
                  ever gave a hue too bright for the <emph>lights</emph> I have endeavoured to flash
                  upon your perception. But when I tell you that you <emph>presume</emph> upon these
                  matchless gifts, and wear them, not as their grateful recipient, but as their
                  arbitrary possessor; that you feel born to rule rather than to win; that you glory
                  in your power, rather than rejoice in your attractions, you may call me a
                  precocious cynic and presumptuous censor, if you will, yet I am nevertheless your
                  best and truest friend."</p>
               <p>L'éclair listened with her eyes riveted upon the floor, and the colour of her
                  cheek heightened till it shamed the ruby gems she wore. He paused as if waiting
                  for a reply, but as still she sat with downward glance, he added:</p>
               <p>"You are not angry, I trust, that I have obeyed your behest?"</p>
               <p>She raised her eyes instantaneously, and he saw with surprise and emotion that
                  their dark surface was glistening with moisture that gave them the softness of
                  velvet.</p>
               <p>"Angry!" repeated she, in a low, sweet voice. "Oh, no! I am pleased, delighted.
                  You are the first person that ever addressed to me the language of truth—except
                  one," she added, and Marcus thought she glanced towards Delaval, who was dancing
                  with Katy, but who occasionally looked towards them with undisguised
                  interest—"except one, and he always does it mockingly. A petted child; an only
                  daughter; a spoiled and pampered heiress, how could I help being self-willed and
                  wayward? When I met you at the fountain, I thought you a mere boy—no older than
                  myself. Pray, how old do you take me to be, Master Marcus Warland?" said she, with
                  a dash of the returning hoyden in her manner.</p>
               <p>"Say seventeen summers bloom upon your cheek," said he, comparing her with his
                  sister, whose fair figure was gliding near.</p>
               <p>"You must be a magician, for just so many years I have numbered. Now I find you
                  with such a majestic earnestness added to years, you are really awe-inspiring.
                  When I look you in the face, I can well believe you no more than nineteen; but
                  judging from your words, I should suppose you at least ninety-and-nine."</p>
               <p>"I am glad you clothe me with such venerable associations,"<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000053"/> said Marcus, laughing. "You will at least think of
                  me with respect."</p>
               <p>"I should think that would be the last feeling so young a man would wish to
                  inspire."</p>
               <p>"Shall I tell you the first?"</p>
               <p>"Yes—though I dare say I shall repent my condescension."</p>
               <p>"It is confidence."</p>
               <p>L'éclair bit her ruby lips, to hide its pouting expression. She would not for
                  worlds show that she was disappointed in the answer, but she certainly expected a
                  different one.</p>
               <p>"Let me for one moment refer to a subject that I cannot dismiss from my thought,"
                  said Marcus, with all his natural, hearty, glowing manner,—"the influence of your
                  mysteriously-winged epistles. I never thought the writer bold or unfeminine. I
                  thought, and still think her a being of strong and generous impulse, and capable
                  of great and glorious influences. Her mystic words have been my inspiration, and
                  my security of success. I felt—I still feel, that she would not thus have written,
                  had she not felt an interest in the aspiring boy whom destiny had thrown across
                  her path. The dreams of his ambition are partly realized. He is climbing the
                  Jura's billowy ridge, with his eye fixed upon the monarch mount, where the thunder
                  dwells and the lightning makes its home."</p>
               <p>It is impossible to describe the varying countenance of the brunette while Marcus
                  was speaking. Now it sparkled with the dewy freshness of the morning; then a soft
                  cloud floated over it; and when he concluded, the fire of a summer noonday flashed
                  from its beams.</p>
               <p>"How well—how clearly you have read me," said she. "How baffling, how triumphant
                  you are. I came in the vain hope of finding amusement in your struggles to pierce
                  through the mystery in which I have enveloped myself—to sport with your curiosity,
                  and exult in my power. I find you armed on every side, as if you had a legion of
                  archangels to contend with, instead of a weak and foolish girl. You have not even
                  asked my name."</p>
               <p>"None can be more beautiful than L'éclair. If you give me a thousand others, that
                  alone shall breathe upon my lips."</p>
               <p>"Well, be it so. I will still be L'éclair till you read me a very different
                  character of myself from what you have done to-night. <emph>Perhaps</emph> I shall
                  remember what you have said. <emph>Perhaps</emph> I shall make the wisdom of my
                  venerable Mentor available for my good. But I should like to know before we again
                  join the dance what you <emph>do</emph> admire in women, you have been so frank in
                  telling me what there is to condemn."</p>
               <p>"Do you see that lady, with pearls braided in her dark hair, with such a sweet,
                  serene countenance, on whose cheek a mellower tint than that of youth's is
                  spread."</p>
               <p>"Yes, she is very lovely."</p>
               <p>"That lady has a gentleness, firmness, and dignity, that so melt into each other,
                  that you cannot tell where one begins and the other ends, any more than you can
                  the blending colours of the rainbow. What I now am I owe to her. When I was a
                  little boy, she kissed me with her angel lips, and infused into mine a portion of
                  her divine spirit. She gave an inner sense of loveliness, an insight into my own
                  nature, and an image of that other nature which I trust will one day blend with
                  mine, and incorporate itself with my being of beings."</p>
               <p>L'éclair's brilliant eyes were fixed on the charming face of Mrs. Bellamy with
                  vivid admiration, when Delaval approached, and laying his hand on the shoulder of
                  Marcus, exclaimed:</p>
               <p>"Don't you see what dark frowns are gathering around you? They are crying out
                  against you as a selfish monopolizer. There is many a bashful youth sighing for an
                  introduction to Miss L'éclair, and begging me to intercede in their behalf."</p>
               <p>"Excuse me, Delaval; I have no desire to extend my acquaintance."</p>
               <p>"You would not draw upon yourself so odious a name as an <emph>exclusive,</emph>"
                  said he, with marked emphasis. She blushed, gave a haughty wave of the head, but
                  rising at the same time and taking his arm. Marcus felt that he had extended their
                     conversation<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6692-00000054"/> sation as far as
                  politeness to others authorized. Delaval led L'éclair to the dance, and though he
                  seemed charmed with the fair Aurora, as he called the blue-eyed Katy, his every
                  look betrayed a strong and earnest interest in the dark girl, whose fascinations
                  he defied. And she treated him with a playfulness and familiarity that seemed like
                  the rebounding of an elastic substance from some strong unusual pressure.</p>
               <p>"She probably looks upon me as a stern moralist," thought Marcus, as he saw her
                  lay her hand confidingly on Delaval's arm and look up in his face with a
                  bewitching smile, "but better so than the plaything of an idle hour. Nay, I will
                  not be unjust. She bore my bold chiding nobly, and soft and beautiful was the
                  inner light that at times came up from her soul and illumined her face. Brilliant,
                  charming, bewildering L'éclair! Should she prove an ignis fatuus, shining over her
                  marshes of folly and vanity, aimless and betraying, I could soon cease to be lured
                  by her light; but if"——</p>
               <p>The mental sentence remained unconcluded, for he had to turn L'éclair in the
                  dance, and reflection vanished in a thrill of electricity.</p>
               <p>When the dance was over and the company dispersing, he again found himself at her
                  side.</p>
               <p>"We leave by the morning's dawn," said she. "My uncle is a man of wondrous
                  punctuality, and will not delay one moment. Delaval, who is bound for the same
                  regions, will bear us company. Farewell, Marcus Warland. Promise not to think less
                  of the wild girl of the fountain for daring to send you some of the random arrows
                  of her reckless brain; and she hopes when she again meets you, she will be able to
                  lay aside the fancy appellation of L'éclair for her own legitimate, baptismal
                  name."</p>
               <p>"I cannot promise to think <emph>less</emph> of one who will henceforth be blended
                  with my highest aspirations and holiest wishes," exclaimed Marcus, with
                  irrepressible enthusiasm. The soft hand extended in parting lingered a moment in
                  his clasp, and she passed away like the lightning of a summer night.</p>

               <p>DURING their journey home, Marcus expressed a strong desire to revisit the scenes
                  of his childhood, the ferryman's cabin, the Long Moss Spring, old Simon, and the
                  banks of the rushing river, that used to murmur his nightly lullaby. Mr. Bellamy
                  immediately proposed to take his place in the carriage, in exchange for his horse,
                  which would carry him by a by-road to his early home.</p>
               <p>"I wish I were going too," exclaimed Katy, looking wistfully after him. "Marcus,
                  don't forget to give my love to old Uncle Simon, and bring me some of the moss
                  from the fountain, and some of the leaves of the magnolia that shades its
                  margin."</p>
               <p>It was with feelings of refreshment and delight that Marcus found himself on
                  horseback in the heart of the cool green woods. Dear as was the society of his
                  friends, just at this time the freedom of his own thoughts was dearer still.
                  Freedom, yes; it was freedom. It was with a jubilant spirit he felt himself free
                  from the collegiate restraints which for three years had bound him. They did not
                  gall him while he wore them, because he never writhed or resisted them, but now
                  they were thrown off he experienced that joy in independence which shows it is the
                  birthright of man. He was happy; he had fulfilled the hopes of his friends; he had
                  attained the reaching of his ambition; but the spot on which he now stood was only
                  a stepping-place for another and loftier ascent. He looked<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000055"/> into the future. According to the promise of his
                  adopted father, he was to enjoy still higher advantages of education in one of the
                  distinguished institutions of New England, and he flew in imagination towards its
                  granite hills, "of eagle hearts the eyrie," with eager anticipations. Delaval was
                  to accompany him. He was to visit him at his own home, called Wood Lawn, after
                  resting a while at Bellamy Place, and they were to start together on their
                  northern journey. We said Marcus was happy. The mysterious joy of a young and
                  growing passion exalted and refined all his perceptions, and even added to the
                  visible glories of creation.</p>
               <p>It was a little past noon of the third day since he had quitted the university,
                  that the first incident occurred of any interest to the young traveller. He was
                  just coming into the main road. He was riding on a grassy path, and the hoofs of
                  his horse made no more noise than if treading on velvet. He saw through the
                  opening boughs a carriage, standing near a little brook that flowed across the
                  road. Seated on a log by the way-side, in the shade of the tall trees, was a
                  group, whose position drove the warm blood from the cheek of Marcus, quickly and
                  oppressively, to his heart. Mr. Alston, the uncle of L'éclair, was seated somewhat
                  apart, near the end of the log, very much engaged in discussing a luncheon of cold
                  turkey and ham. Delaval sat at the opposite end, his arm thrown caressingly round
                  the waist of L'éclair, whose head reclined wearily, but gracefully, on his
                  shoulder. Her bonnet was tossed on the ground, her hair was loose and sported
                  wildly over Delaval's arm, as the forest vine round the oak to which it clings. An
                  indescribable pang pierced the heart of Marcus, that heart a moment before so glad
                  and glowing. The treachery of Delaval, who professed such indifference to
                  L'éclair,—Delaval, whom he thought the mirror of truth and frankness; the levity
                  and unmaidenly forwardness of L'éclair, in forcing herself on his thoughts, while
                  she was cherishing an attachment to another;—he knew not which cut the deepest,
                  the coldest. He could not accost them. Gently turning his horse, (if there was a
                  rustling motion among the leaves, it was drowned in the soft gurgles of the
                  wimpling brook,) he rode back into the woods, without disturbing the noonday
                  siesta of the travellers. As soon as he was far enough removed to be beyond the
                  reach of discovery, he threw himself from his horse, and casting himself down
                  under the first tree he saw, leaned back against the rough bark, immovable as the
                  trunk that supported him. He felt as if he were suddenly transported from the
                  equatorial to the polar regions, such a freezing sense of falsehood and deceit
                  congealed his blood and turned his veins to icicles. Nor did he think of himself
                  alone. He thought of his blue-eyed sister, listening as he had seen her to the
                  artful compliments of Delaval, whose black eyes, riveted on her modest face,
                  seemed to speak unutterable things. He thought of all this, and he execrated the
                  heartless vanity that fed on the wounded confidence of others. L'éclair! ah, what
                  a beautiful vision of girlish enthusiasm, pure and ardent impulses, true and
                  generous feeling, what a promise of glorious womanhood were all swept away. <q>

               <p>"Never again," thought the youth, when, after an hour's deep abstraction, he left
                  the solitude of the woods, "shall I have undoubting faith in man or woman. Is the
                  world made of elements like these? If it be, save me, my guardian angel, from its
                  chilling contact."</p>
               <p>Marcus slept that night in a rough hut, belonging to a woodman, for his delay had
                  prevented him from reaching the usual stopping-place. He met with another
                  obstruction, in being compelled to have his horse re-shod; so that he did not
                  reach his old home till towards night on the following day. It was just such a
                  quiet, mellow evening as when Mr. Bellamy rode up, the last time, the same path he
                  was travelling. He saw the smoke of the chimney, lazily yet gracefully curling
                  upward above the forest trees, before the low, dark walls met his view. The
                  thoughts, feelings, and experience of nine years were all<pb n="112-113"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000056"/> crowded into one moment of time, and the heart of
                  the young man was full. He had left that spot a boy, whom peculiar trials had
                  invested with precocious energy of character,—he came, in the dawning of his
                  manhood, crowned with classic laurels, to bathe his lip once more in that sacred
                  fountain, where his father had been baptized with the waters of life. He
                  dismounted and tied his horse to a well-known post, though now infirm, and leaning
                  forward, like a decrepit old man. He saw the old ferry-boat, looking darker and
                  heavier than ever, moored at the same place, the long propelling-poles crossed on
                  the planking. But when a sudden curve in the path brought him within view of the
                  spring, the Long Moss Spring, the waters all gilded and crimsoned by the reflected
                  hues of summer's effulgent sunset—his soul heaved and glowed like those waters;
                  and seated under the magnolia's shade, with his head supported by both hands, sat
                  a figure old and bent, with bare grizzled wool, and a face whose hard wrinkles
                  looked as if carved out of lignum vitæ, blackened by smoke. A threadbare, faded
                  uniform coat, that coat of many memories, covered the shoulders of the old
                  soldier, who sat on the brink of the fountain, watching the eternal flow of its
                  waters, probably musing on the cherished images of past years. Marcus leaped
                  forward and stood on the white stones that surrounded the basin, uttering a joyous
                  cry. The old soldier lifted his dim eyes, and gazed upon the bright, sunny-locked,
                  springing figure, that had arisen, like the young and radiant river-god, near the
                  fountain of the virgin Arethusa.</p>
               <p>"Simon—old Uncle Simon—old soldier," exclaimed Marcus, holding out his hand to the
                  bewildered old man; "don't you know me? don't you remember Marcus, Marcus Warland,
                  Aunt Milly's pet, and little Katy's brother?"</p>
               <p>"The Lord save my ole eyes!—you don't say so!" said the negro, in a tremulous
                  voice, slowly rising and gazing long on the youth, who was shaking his hard and
                  ridgy hand with a true college gripe. "Mercy on me—I do believe it is—I do
                  indeed—Heavenly Master, what a fine young man you got to be! Bless my soul and
                  body—if it isn't master Marcus! and he haint forgot poor old Simon—he haint—jist
                  to think on't—bless his heart—I can now say with good ole Simeon, when he seed the
                  promised land, 'Let thy servant depart—I live long enuff this time.' I've seed
                  young master again—and he 'members poor old Simon."</p>
               <p>
                  <emph>By this time</emph> Uncle Simon had wrought himself up to the highest pitch
                  of sensibility, and stopped, weeping and sobbing like a child.</p>
               <p>"Forget you, Uncle Simon! no, indeed! How could you think me so ungrateful?—you,
                  who were so kind and good to me when a boy? We all remember you, and wish you were
                  with us again, wish you were with the excellent Mr. Bellamy."</p>
               <p>"And Milly—bless the good ole soul!" cried the old soldier, his recollections
                  fertilized and vivified by the copious shower that had watered them; "how is she?
                  I never, never forget ole Milly; she mighty good to Simon. She used to talk
                  Scripter, too, jist like a book. She mighty knowing woman, Milly was; and little
                  mistress Katy—how she do? She 'member Uncle Simon, too? I tote her many a time to
                  this here spring, and put her head all over in, every bit on't. She big lady now.
                  She got sweetheart—hey, master?"</p>
               <p>Simon gave Marcus a little punch in the side, and opening his mouth, let out one
                  of his old-fashioned laughs, such as Milly used to echo. While he was thus
                  recreating himself, Marcus stooped over the fountain and quaffed its cold,
                  icy-cold stream. How beautiful the long moss waved, now deep sea-green, now deep
                  sky-blue below! How white, how pure was the basin, smooth and spotless from the
                  ceaseless lavation of the waters! How sparkling was the foam, how silvery the gush
                  of the rill!—Ah! this was the spirit of the place! The old cabin was dilapidated,
                  and inhabited by strangers; the grounds looked neglected; even the river seemed
                  defaced by the dark old ferry-boat that lay sluggishly on its bosom; but this
                  perennial spring, pure and fresh and clear, was a living,<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000057"/> singing, joyous being, the emblem of his own youth,
                  the reservoir of memory, the birthplace of hope.</p>
               <p>"Who inhabits the cabin, Simon?" asked Marcus. "It is in rather a ruinous
                  condition."</p>
               <p>"I forgit his name," said the old man. "He no quality folks like <emph>your</emph>
                  family, young master; jist poor, no-account sort of people. I jist comes here,
                  'cause I can't live without it. I comes to sit about and think of ole times.
                  Master don't make me work any more. I shan't live long, anyhow, young master. Ole
                  Simon jist like a field of dry fodder—ready to be pull down and trodden in the
                  oven; but if the Lord put me in the heavenly house up yonder, I no care how soon
                  the scythe of the 'stroyer come, and hack away the ole black shuck."</p>
               <p>Marcus sat with his old friend, talking of past times, till the gleam of sunset
                  died on the fountain, and its cold, gray surface gave back the sober tints of
                  twilight.</p>
               <p>"Is the man who keeps the ferry at home?" asked Marcus.</p>
               <p>"I don't knows, young master, but his wife be."</p>
               <p>"I must ask her for a night's lodging. There are echoes in those walls to me,
                  Uncle Simon, that will talk with me till midnight is gone by."</p>
               <p>"Yes, young master, I does think it be haunted—'deed I does. I seed a sperrit
                  myself go one night right round the house, with a white handkercher on, just like
                  Milly. I 'fraid Milly going to die."</p>
               <p>The woman coming out to dip a bucket of water from the spring, Marcus asked if she
                  would give him a night's lodging. Though common-looking and coarsely dressed, she
                  seemed to have a native sense of politeness and an innate love of the beautiful,
                  for she looked at Marcus with evident admiration, and accorded him the boon he
                  asked.</p>
               <p>"You will have but a bad time of it, I can tell you," said she. "It is a poor
                  place for the like of you to sleep in."</p>
               <p>Marcus smiled, and followed her into the cabin, where he had so often slept the
                  sound sleep of childhood. As he entered and looked round the dark, unplastered
                  walls, and contrasted them with the elegant rooms of Bellamy Place, he wondered if
                  he ever could have breathed the air of contentment within those rough, unhewn
                  logs. He had forgotten that it contained but one room, and apologized to the woman
                  for his intrusion.</p>
               <p>"Only lend me a blanket and pillow," said he, "and I can sleep gloriously on the
                  white rock by the side of the fountain. The moon shines to-night, and the day has
                  been very warm and sultry."</p>
               <p>In vain the really hospitable woman insisted upon giving him her bed, and sleeping
                  in the kitchen. Marcus would not have exchanged the bed he had chosen for a royal
                  canopy. After a supper of bacon, fish, and corn hoe-cake, such as he had often
                  partaken of with a much better relish, he begged her to deposit a blanket and
                  pillow under the magnolia boughs, and calling to Simon, went to the ferry-boat,
                  and jumping in, grasped one of the poles, and gave the other to him.</p>
               <p>"Let us have a push over the river for the sake of auld lang syne, Uncle Simon.
                  See, the moon is rising, rolling up, like a great silver wheel, out of the river.
                  I long to see if I can do now what I did nine years ago."</p>
               <p>While they were unfastening the chain that confined it to the shore, the woman
                  came running from the cabin, quite breathless.</p>
               <p>"What are you going to do with that boat, sir?"</p>
               <p>"I forgot," said Marcus, laughing. "I forgot to ask permission. I only wanted to
                  push it once across the river, and back again."</p>
               <p>"I expect husband every instant, and I don't know what he would say if he found
                  the boat t'other side, and he not in it."</p>
               <p>"I leave my horse as a security that I will not run away with the boat," said
                  Marcus, "and my hat and gloves too," added he, giving them a light toss into her
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"Oh! you had better keep on your gloves, I tell you, sir. Your hands look too
                  white and delicate like to handle them dirty poles."</p>
               <p>Marcus cast a disdainful glance at his fair hands. He<pb n="116-117"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000058"/> wished he could harden and embrown them, but it was
                  not the life of a student that would do it.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you would jump in and go with us," said Marcus, observing that she looked
                  doubtfully and wishfully on the river, "then you will not be anxious about the
                  boat."</p>
               <p>"Thankee, I don't care if I do," answered she with alacrity, and stepping in, she
                  snatched the pole from the tremulous hand of Simon, and told Marcus she would help
                  him to push it. She was young and active, and seemed to enjoy the sport keenly of
                  seeing such a handsome young man, dressed so finely, pushing away lustily as a
                  boatman. It was really a novel trio. Old Simon stood at the head of the boat,
                  holding by the lantern-post, in his battered regimentals, looking like a militia
                  ghost in the moonshine; the stout, sunburnt, but now bright-faced woman,
                  brandishing her pole, and laughing merrily at the fair young man, whose hands
                  gleamed so white on the black rod he was wielding, and whose magnificent hair
                  glistened and waved like molten gold. Marcus, whose experience of the previous day
                  had been weighing heavily, coldly on his heart, felt at this moment a wild gayety
                  as foreign to his nature as the depression that had been sinking him. Old habits
                  resumed their power. The water seemed his native element, and dashing his pole
                  into the strong current till he threw a shower of wet diamonds on old Simon's
                  snowy wool and the dishevelled locks of the ferryman's wife, he leaned back with
                  all his strength, mirroring the moonbeams on his polished brow. When they reached
                  the bank, Marcus beheld with astonishment a gentleman seated in an open buggy,
                  waiting to cross. He had come down the hill while the boat was going over, but
                  they were too much excited to notice him. Marcus could not help laughing at the
                  singular appearance he must present to the eye of the stranger, but he had no
                  alternative but to push back even as he had come, and finish the evening's frolic.
                  The gentleman descended from his buggy as soon as he had driven into the boat, and
                  looked at Marcus with evident curiosity osity and surprise. He was a young man,
                  well-dressed, and carrying his head very loftily.</p>
               <p>"Young master," said Uncle Simon, seeing Marcus take one hand from the pole and
                  expose its palm to the night air, as if its coolness were refreshing, "you
                  blistering your hands, you know you be. They tenderer now than they was when you
                  little boy, and push, push most all the time. Lord bless me, jist to think you
                  ever did do sich a thing afore, looking so like a born angel as you do."</p>
               <p>Marcus felt his blood rush hotly to his face as he encountered the insolent stare
                  of the young man at this reminiscence of Uncle Simon. It was Mr. Bellamy's wish,
                  when he went to college, that he should never allude to his father's past history;
                  that he should be considered as his adopted son; and Marcus had scrupulously
                  obeyed him. As this period of his life was associated with his father's moral
                  degradation, he could not wish to allude to it before a stranger. Simon, who, with
                  the garrulity of age, and its imbecility too, dreamed not he was saying any thing
                  his "blessed young master" would wish unsaid, continued his remarks, regardless of
                  the presence of the haughty stranger.</p>
               <p>"Young master, how do ole master like his new profession? How do he like the
                  business of overseeing the black, coloured population? Do he have much trouble? He
                  in very 'sponsible office. I hope he have wisdom from the Great Overseer of black
                  and white, way up yonder, young master; wisdom, such as the Lord gave Saul when he
                  built him the big idifice, all out of solid gold."</p>
               <p>Again the insolent eyes of the young man measured the figure of Marcus from head
                  to foot, while a supercilious smile curved his lips. Marcus's spirit was roused.
                  The unfortunate allusions of old Simon were particularly galling at this moment.
                  Indeed, they would have been at any moment. For where is the youth of the age of
                  Marcus, fresh from close communion with the aristocracy of the land, honoured
                  himself among the most honourable as the adopted son of a wealthy<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000059"/> planter, who would not shrink from being addressed
                  as the son of a ferryman and overseer? Years hence he might look upon the warring
                  passions of this hour with a superior smile; but now his brow contracted, his
                  fingers quivered, his blue eyes darkened and burned as they gave back the haughty
                  stare of the stranger, and never did a prouder smile curl the lips of the Delphic
                  god, when seen by the divinities in his pastoral attire, than rested on Marcus's
                  disdainful mouth. There was something in his countenance that made the stranger
                  think it best to withdraw his inspection, and the boat went over the waves as if
                  propelled by a giant's hand. The moment they landed, Marcus caught up his hat and
                  gloves, and, without looking at the stranger, walked towards the spring,
                  forgetting in his excitement that he had given no answer to old Simon's well-meant
                  but ill-timed questions.</p>
               <p>"You no 'fended with ole Simon, young master?" said the old negro, hobbling after
                  him, seeing that something was wrong, and having sense enough to connect himself
                  with it.</p>
               <p>"No, Uncle Simon. I did not answer, because that ill-bred stranger was annoying me
                  so with his rudeness. He is gone, and I am glad of it. I hear his wheels lumbering
                  over the gravel. You asked after my father. He is well and happy—happier than he
                  has been for long years. If he were the brother of Mr. Bellamy, he could not be
                  more honoured."</p>
               <p>"The Lord be praised," said Uncle Simon, devoutly.</p>
               <p>"And now good-night, Uncle Simon. I am going to sleep just where I am; and I am
                  going to start very early in the morning. I came far out of my way to see you and
                  the old place, and I am glad I find you alive and well. I wish you could come and
                  live with us. If I ever have a home of my own, and you are alive, you shall come
                  and have a nice, comfortable cabin by it. Katy says too you must live with her
                  when she is married. So there is some danger of your being divided. Here, Uncle
                  Simon, take this to remember us both," added Marcus, filling his wrinkled hand
                  with silver. "I shall be this way again some time. Good-bye. I am glad you linger
                  near this spring. You must always guard it for my sake."</p>
               <p>Simon wept again at the token of his young master's kindness, and at the thought
                  of bidding him farewell.</p>
               <p>"Me never see you no more," said the aged negro; "but me hope to meet you in
                  heaven above, where we both be one colour, one people, white as snow, inside and
                  out. Tell Milly I 'spect to meet her there, and Miss Katy too, bless her little
                  heart. Ole Simon 'member 'em all, every one, in his prayers to heavenly
                  Master."</p>
               <p>Marcus looked after the old Christian soldier with melancholy interest, for in all
                  human probability he would never see him again in this world; then spreading the
                  blanket on the hard rock, he stretched himself by the fountain whose sweet,
                  soothing, minor tone stole lovingly in his ears, and calmed his exasperated
                  spirit. Every thing around breathed of such heavenly tranquillity, it could not
                  but be diffused into his own soul. The shadow of the magnolia leaves played upon
                  his face, the moonbeams played upon the waters, and the long blue-green moss
                  played in the clear, silvered depths of the fountain. Vainly did Marcus try to
                  shut one bright, deluding image from his mind. Vainly did he sigh for the fabled
                  stream of Lethé to wash out its remembrance. L'éclair sparkled in the moonlight
                  waters—L'éclair whispered in the murmuring rill—L'éclair bent over him in the
                  fragrant tree. At last he slept, and L'éclair floated into his dreams, and
                  converted them into a bewildering maze. The angel, who stept into the pool of
                  Bethesda, imparting a healing influence to the troubled waters, could hardly have
                  looked more like a celestial messenger, than Marcus, slumbering calmly in the
                  silver moonbeams, that imparted their pale glory to his youthful features. The
                  ferryman's wife came down at a late hour, to dip her bucket in the spring; but so
                  charmed, so awe-struck was she, by the beauty of his repose, she would not disturb
                  it by the plunge of her wooden vessel, and turned away, with stilly footsteps.</p>
               <p>The sweet twittering of the birds in his leafy canopy awakened<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000060"/> kened him at the dawning day. Starting and leaning
                  forward, he saw himself reflected in the blue mirror of the fountain. He knew not
                  where he was. Passing his fingers through his dewy hair, he tried to recollect and
                  define his present position. Was the shrill warble just then swelling above him,
                  the peal of the college bell? Was the murmuring sound in his ears the hum of the
                  students' voices, as they went hurrying to the morning prayer? No; it all flashed
                  upon him at once—he was in the vestibule of the great temple of day, from whose
                  unpillared dome the twilight shadows were faintly, slowly rolling away, before the
                  coming of the god that was soon to ascend his burning throne. Kneeling on the
                  rock, late his couch, and now his altar, he mingled his morning orison with the
                  balmy incense that was rising from the bosom of the earth.</p>
               <p>Not for three years had Marcus felt so fully and deeply the influence of devotion.
                  The hurry and confusion attending morning prayers at college, the irreverent rush,
                  the half-made toilet, the lingering yawn, and scarce-wakened attention, convert
                  these hasty exercises into a cold, unmeaning ritual. He rose and bathed his face
                  and hands in the spring, perceiving that his hostess had laid a nice napkin on the
                  rock for his use. Remembering Katy's parting injunction to bring her the moss and
                  magnolia leaves, he gathered some of both, then rightly believing the ferryman's
                  wife would come at an early hour to see if her blanket were safe, he deposited
                  some money in its folds, and was soon mounted and on his way through the woods.
                  The next evening he arrived at Bellamy Place, after an absence of two years. Aunt
                  Milly, who did not look a day older than when he saw her last, had arrayed herself
                  in her best attire to welcome home her darling young master. She was never
                  satisfied with gazing upon him. She walked round and round him, believing with
                  Simon that he was a "born angel." She received Simon's message with reverential
                  emotions, mingled with tears.</p>
               <p>"Poor ole soul!" said she, "and did he tell you to say so to Milly? Yes! he ripe
                  for the kingdom come. He good ole Christian, if ever was one."</p>
               <p>Mr. Warland lifted his heart in gratitude to God, for having given him such a son.
                  All that he was himself he owed to him. It is true, Mr. Bellamy had taken him by
                  the hand, and raised him from poverty to comfort and respectability; but it was
                  Marcus who had rescued him from ruin, ruin of body and soul. It was he who had
                  sustained him when the spirit of temptation rent him, as it were, in twain, and
                  led him to the Divine Healer. The father had felt a dread lest his fatal passion
                  should prove hereditary—lest his son, exposed to the temptations of a college
                  life, might yield to the seductions of evil example, and feel that sting more
                  deadly than the fangs of the serpent, than the bite of the adder. But now he stood
                  before him, in his stainless purity and fair renown, blending the grace and
                  simplicity of youth with the dignity of advancing manhood.</p>
               <p>Marcus, who had heard and mourned the tragic fate of the beautiful mulatto girl,
                  was led by Katy to her grave, over which the willow wept, and round which the
                  sweet vines trailed, and went clambering over the marble slab that marked her name
                  and age. Those who believe that the southern negro lives and dies, uncared-for and
                  unlamented as the brutes that perish, would not imagine that it was over the tomb
                  of an humble mulatto that brother and sister were now leaning; that it was for her
                  the tear was glistening in the young man's eyes, and bedewing the fair cheek of
                  the maiden. Katy never could visit the grave of Cora without tears, and she often
                  pulled up the weeds that grew among the blossoms that adorned it.</p>
               <p>"What is become of King?" asked Marcus.</p>
               <p>"He is married to Pinky, a young negro as black as ebony."</p>
               <p>"Alas, for the constancy of man!" cried Marcus. "I should have thought poor Cora's
                  sad death would have purchased a longer lease of love."</p>
               <p>"He was so much flattered and admired as a young widower by the black damsels,"
                  said Katy, "I do not wonder so much.<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6692-00000061"/>
                  But poor Hannibal still mourns, and refuses to be solaced by a new attachment. I
                  used to be afraid of Hannibal, but now I would trust him sooner than any negro on
                  the plantation."</p>
               <p>"I believe he is worthy to be trusted; worthier than some white men I know," said
                  Marcus, looking so earnestly at Katy that her eyes as usual were bowed to the
                  earth.</p>
               <p>"Have you been deceived in any of your friends, Marcus?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Katy, in one whom I loved even as my own brother. Do you remember Delaval,
                  who distinguished you so much at college?"</p>
               <p>"Yes." The monosyllable was very low, and Katy twisted her fingers in the willow
                  boughs.</p>
               <p>"I have every reason to believe him betrothed to the young lady who was introduced
                  to you by the name of L'éclair, though he professed to me indifference to her
                  attractions. I feared you might have been pleased by his flatteries, you know so
                  little of the insincerity of the world. She is a brilliant heiress, and what has
                  my little Katy to weigh in the balance but a sweet face and a true and spotless
                  heart?"</p>
               <p>He drew her arm through his, and they walked towards the house. Katy shivered—"Are
                  you cold?" said Marcus.</p>
               <p>"No," answered Katy, sadly, "but I could not help it."</p>
               <p>No, she could not help it, poor girl. She felt a chill such as no outward elements
                  can cause. Marcus did not know how much of apparently downright, heart-gushing
                  love Delaval had infused into Katy's unsophisticated ear, and how believingly and
                  trustingly she had listened. If he had, his indignation would have been far
                  greater.</p>
               <p>His visit to Delaval, to which he had looked forward so eagerly, was now a
                  necessity to which he reluctantly submitted. They were to travel together to the
                  North, and he had engaged to meet him at his own home. Though he could no longer
                  confide in him as a friend, his obligations as a gentleman were binding, and must
                  be fulfilled. He received a very pressing and affectionate letter from Delaval,
                  urging his coming, and winding up with some glowing compliments to Katy he did not
                  think proper to repeat. The young man threatened to come himself and carry him to
                  Wood Lawn, if he did not very soon report himself there. This was the last thing
                  Marcus wished, on his sister's account; he therefore hurried his departure, and
                  found himself, with a heart not quite so light as it was two years before, on the
                  road to Wood Lawn. He tried to think calmly on the possibility of meeting
                  L'éclair, and of treating her with the indifference her levity and vain desire for
                  conquest merited. He tried to forget her, but she was a golden thread not
                  regularly woven into his being that could be soberly unravelled without destroying
                  the whole, but shot here and there in zigzag line, difficult to follow and
                  impossible to separate.</p>
               <p>Wood Lawn was an elegant establishment, still more imposing in appearance than
                  Bellamy Place, though occupying a less commanding site. Marcus had lingered
                  purposely on the journey during the middle of the days, as he was in Mr. Bellamy's
                  private carriage, and could command his own time. It was to leave him at Wood
                  Lawn, where he arrived at candlelight. He preferred the hour of night, as he could
                  meet Delaval with less constraint than in the blaze of day. Nothing could be more
                  hearty and cordial than the greeting of Delaval. He bounded down the steps of the
                  piazza, and actually hugged Marcus in his arms.</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow—my noble fellow—I am so glad you are come. It is an age since I
                  have seen you. Come in—let me look at you again, illustrissime adolescens."</p>
               <p>"Oh, for more sincerity and less profession," thought Marcus, whose chilled heart
                  could not respond to this joyous greeting. Delaval led the way to a private
                  apartment.</p>
               <p>"Come," says he, "I know you want to brush off a little of the dust of travelling
                  before presenting yourself to the ladies. I have described you as such an Apollo,
                  you must do justice to my description."</p>
               <p>"What ladies?" asked Marcus, carelessly arranging his hair. He had arrived at a
                  sublime indifference to the whole<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC6692-00000062"/>
                  female sex, with the exception of his sister and Mrs. Bellamy; at least, he had
                  imposed on himself this conviction.</p>
               <p>"My sister, and Mrs. Lewis, who acts as duenna to the first, a most agreeable and
                  excellent lady notwithstanding"—</p>
               <p>"I do not remember your ever speaking of your sister," said Marcus.</p>
               <p>"Oh, I must have done it a hundred times. Neither did I remember that you had ever
                  spoken of yours, till I saw the sweetest, fairest blue-eyed damsel that ever stole
                  into the bowers of fancy. You never spoke of her to me. You thought her too sacred
                  to introduce into the walls of a college, and I suppose I had similar feelings
                  with regard to Florence."</p>
               <p>His gay allusion to Katy awakened the bitter feelings of Marcus, and it was with a
                  clouded brow he turned to follow Delaval from the room.</p>
               <p>"What in the world is the matter with you?" exclaimed Delaval, stopping on the
                  threshold, and looking directly in the face of Marcus. "I never saw one so altered
                  in my life. By the shade of Cicero, you must be going through a metem-psychosis,
                  you are so solemn and cold. Good heavens, Marcus, have I offended you?"</p>
               <p>There was something so straightforward in the look, so honest in the tones of
                  Delaval, that Marcus could not resist their momentary influence. With his native
                  frankness he grasped his hand, and said—</p>
               <p>"Delaval, I <emph>am</emph> hurt that you have not trusted me—that you have
                  deceived me with regard to L'éclair. Why did you conceal your attachment for her,
                  and watch me like the blinded moth fluttering round the blaze, that might consume
                  me?"</p>
               <p>"Why, Warland, you are beside yourself," cried Delaval, with a gay laugh, that
                  grated on the ears of Marcus. "What has happened since we left college to put such
                  an idea in your head? I am sure we parted in all warmth and confidence."</p>
               <p>Marcus told Delaval the transient glimpse he had caught of himself and L'éclair by
                  the running brook, and the conviction that was forced upon his mind.</p>
               <p>"My dear fellow," said Delaval, laughing, and blushing at the same time; "is that
                  all? Why, the poor girl was weary, and there was no back to the log, and I could
                  not help supporting her. I acknowledge that I love her, Warland; but if
                     <emph>my</emph> love interfere with your happiness, I promise to root it from
                  my heart. Come, let us dismiss this subject for the present. I long to introduce
                  Florence to you. I wish she might rival that witch of a L'éclair."</p>
               <p>Delaval conducted Marcus through a long hall to a large and brilliantly lighted
                  drawing-room, where two ladies were seated on a sofa, the farther side of the
                  room. The elder lady, whom Delaval introduced as Mrs. Lewis, rose and advanced
                  near the door to greet the stranger, whom Delaval had warmly recommended to her
                  favour. The younger remained seated, her face averted from the light, and shaded
                  by a cloud of jetty ringlets.</p>
               <p>"Florence," said Delaval, drawing Marcus towards the sofa, "this is my friend,
                  Marcus Warland. Warland, this is my sister Florence, a very provoking, but rather
                  clever girl, on the whole."</p>
               <p>The young lady stood up and turned towards Marcus, with a crimson cheek and a
                  smiling lip. The resplendent eyes of L'éclair flashed laughingly upon him.</p>
               <p>"L'éclair!" he exclaimed, snatching the hand she only half extended. "L'éclair,
                  you have indeed made a plaything of me—you too, Delaval," said he, bending on him
                  his now radiant countenance; "you, too, have been leagued against me."</p>
               <p>"It is all <emph>her</emph> doings," replied Delaval. "I told you she was the most
                  self-willed little gipsy in the universe. She <emph>would</emph> make me do just
                  what she pleased, sadly against my own conscience."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid <emph>you have</emph> something to answer for," said Marcus, "in
                  denying your office of carrier-dove, with such offended majesty."</p>
               <p>"You recollect, Warland, I never actually denied it. I assumed a lofty tone,
                  implying the impossibility of my doing any thing so silly and girl-like, as I
                  really think it was."</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC6692-00000063"/>
               <p>"Let me entreat you both," cried Florence, with an air of charming ingenuousness,
                  "never to allude to those acts of folly, which have long since cost me my own
                  self-esteem. Had I then felt as I do now, worlds would not have tempted me into
                  such reckless disregard of what is due to myself." Blushing at the energy of her
                  expressions, she added, "Let all this be forgotten, with the name of L'éclair. I
                  am henceforth Florence—Florence to both. Pray don't call me Miss Delaval, Mr.
                  Warland; I could not tolerate that."</p>
               <p>"And pray don't call me <emph>Mr. Warland,</emph> then. I have never been
                     <emph>Mistered</emph> yet, and I hope the formal title will not commence on
                  your lips."</p>
               <p>"What shall I call you?—Master Marcus Warland?"</p>
               <p>"I am Marcus, at home—Warland, in college. I love home-born associations
                  best."</p>
               <p>"Well, you shall be Marcus to me, and Warland to George; so both appellations
                  shall be honoured."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Lewis had left the room, and the trio sat on the sofa, in the full light and
                  joy of restored confidence. Marcus could hardly identify himself with the
                  sternly-resolving being of the hour before. He wondered at his own stupidity in
                  believing it possible that the frank, the generous, the manly Delaval could be
                  treacherous and betraying; the wild, the impulsive, the high-souled L'éclair a
                  cold, vain, deceiving flirt. Never had he seen her so lovely, so fascinating as at
                  this moment. The bright nymph of the fountain, the brilliant incognita of the pen,
                  the graceful muse of the ball-room, were less interesting and attractive, than the
                  young girl in her simple juvenile dress, her dazzling charms, softened and
                  tempered by the mellowing light of home, responding alternately to her brother's
                  playful <foreign xml:lang="FRA">jeus d'esprit,</foreign> and to the now fluent
                  tongue of Marcus.</p>
               <p>When supper was announced, they were joined by the dignified uncle, Mr. Alston,
                  the guardian of Florence and her brother. He was a very cold, silent gentleman,
                  but studiously polite in his manners. He was elaborately aristocratic in every
                  thing he said and did; aristocratic in dress, in equipage, and his whole
                  demeanour. He was oppressively polite to Marcus, whose position at college was so
                  distinguished, and who, as the ward of Mr. Bellamy, had a passport to the best
                  families in the South. Mrs. Lewis, who presided at the table, had a mild and
                  prepossessing countenance, and performed the honours of hospitality with less show
                  but more grace than the stately Mr. Alston. Though he conversed but little, he
                  sometimes made set speeches, and he deemed this a proper occasion for one. Laying
                  down his knife and fork, and folding his hands, he said,—</p>
               <p>"I am very happy, Mr. Warland, to welcome you to Wood Lawn. I observed with great
                  pleasure the manner in which you distinguished yourself at the university, and the
                  high honours which you obtained. Mr. Bellamy is a gentleman, too, whom I respect
                  very highly as a gentleman, and as a man of wealth and family. I am exceedingly
                  particular with whom I associate, or admit as companions to my nephew and niece.
                  It is difficult to break off low associations, much better never to form them. I
                  consider you in every respect an unexceptionable young gentleman; and I again
                  repeat, I am happy to welcome you to Wood Lawn."</p>
               <p>With a dignified and self-respecting bow, Mr. Alston resumed his knife and fork.
                  It was not without a great effort that Marcus preserved proper gravity of
                  demeanour during this elaborate address, for a bright eyebeam from Florence, full
                  of mirth and mischief, played upon him for a moment with contagious power.
                  Delaval, too, wore a look of such assumed and patient attention, that Marcus found
                  his only safety was in looking at Mr. Alston, and appearing duly honoured by the
                  august greeting. He replied with the simplest possible expression of gratitude,
                  hoping he might be spared a similar infliction.</p>
               <p>When the supper was concluded, and they returned to the drawing-room, Marcus felt
                  a rebound of all his faculties, so heavy had been the weight of Mr. Alston's
                  overpowering aristocracy. He was convinced, that had Uncle Simon made the same
                  revelations before him that he had before the stranger<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000064"/> of the boat, he would not have given him that
                  studied welcome. Delaval placed Florence at the piano, and called forth her most
                  exhilarating strains. At first she played only the gayest waltzes and quicksteps,
                  and Marcus feared the vocal charm was wanting, to give a soul to her brilliant
                  execution. But he was mistaken. Florence had a sweet and powerful voice, and one
                  capable of expressing the deepest and saddest feelings. Indeed, its greatest
                  fascination consisted in a certain tremulous, tearful sound, expressive of
                  unfathomable sensibility. It reminded you of Juliet weeping over the tomb of her
                  Romeo, Cordelia mourning over her white-locked maniac sire, Viola hiding in her
                  heart the love that fed upon her damask cheek. It was evident that she felt what
                  she sang, for her countenance changed with every changing note. Marcus could not
                  have believed it possible that it could express such depth of melancholy; but when
                  she sat, with her long lashes drooping towards her cheek, its carnation hue
                  melting into the softest olive, and her arch and smiling lip quivering with
                  tenderness, he repeated to himself, again and again,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, what a heart is there! what capabilities of love and passion lie hidden under
                  that usually gay, brilliant exterior! what equal capacities for sorrow and
                  despair! Charming, impassioned L'éclair! were it mine to awaken the first, how
                  carefully, how jealously would I guard thee from the last."</p>
               <p>"Come, lady fair, give us a blither measure," cried Delaval. "Warland looks as if
                  he were turning into a weeping willow, and I have saturated my white handkerchief
                  already."</p>
               <p>It was astonishing with what rapidity she dashed into one of the most inspiring,
                  exciting airs of the day. The soft, veiling mist vanished from her eyes, the
                  carnation came back to her cheek, the smile to her lip. Then Marcus said to
                  himself, with a sigh,—</p>
               <p>"Where there is such wondrous versatility of feeling, can there be really depth
                  and strength? Is it not superficial, after all? She calls <emph>me</emph> an
                  enigma. Never was there one like her."</p>
               <p>Marcus was to remain several days with his friend, and bright and pleasant days
                  they were. Mr. Alston, at each meal, inflicted upon him one of his formal
                  addresses, but as he was now prepared for them, he knew better how to reply. He
                  found that Florence had a highly cultivated mind for so young a girl; that she was
                  a passionate lover of books, with a marvellous memory that retained all she read.
                  She took him to her library, a small and tastefully decorated room, opening by a
                  bow-window into the garden. Full, rich, scarlet curtains shaded this window,
                  looped up on each side to let in the light, and a sweet-scented vine that came
                  clambering up of its own accord and twined about the frame.</p>
               <p>"I know," said Florence, sweeping aside the folds of the curtains, so as to give
                  him a broader view of the gilded tomes; "I know it is in very bad taste to have
                  this red drapery to adorn a library. It should be green, dark classic green, or
                  imperial purple; but neither green nor purple will do to bring in contact with my
                  Egyptian face. I must contrast it with the brilliant scarlet, or gorgeous orange.
                  These volumes," continued she, pointing to some of more massy form and antique
                  binding, "were my father's, and belong by right to George, though I find much to
                  admire and venerate in the old masters, and sometimes, when I change their
                  position and wipe the dust from the binding, I stand, like Dominie Sampson,
                  mounted on that flight of steps, forgetful of time or place. These shelves," added
                  she, turning to a lighter, more ornamented range, "are all my own, exclusively my
                  own. It is here I feel the wizard spell of genius, and wander in the moonlight
                  climes of poetry and romance."</p>
               <p>"And it is here," said Marcus, laying his hand on a superb portfolio that was laid
                  upon the table; "here you enclose the burning thoughts, whose influence other
                  minds must own and feel. Here you imprison the electric fire, whose sparks might
                  kindle the coldest substance, and even pass through insulating mediums."</p>
               <p>"Does Marcus Warland condescend to flatter?" asked she, with a dash of scorn in
                  her manner. "Oh! if you knew how<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6692-00000065"/> I
                  detest flattery! I have had so much of it, merely because I am an heiress, and had
                  the misfortune to lose my parents when I was very young. I was two years at a
                  northern school, and found my true level there. When I attended your commencement
                  I had just returned, and found it very difficult to persuade George not to
                  acknowledge me as his sister on that occasion."</p>
               <p>"If he had," said Marcus, colouring, "I should have been saved some keen
                  after-pangs."</p>
               <p>"How is that?" cried she quickly, without looking up.</p>
               <p>"I should not then have mistaken the affection of a brother for the permitted
                  endearments of a lover," replied Marcus, emboldened by her vivid blushes.</p>
               <p>"And why should that pain you, selfish being that you are?" said she with her own
                  peculiar, mocking smile. "Is the heart so narrow that it can contain but one
                  object of interest? Is it a dungeon, where the poor captive sits in solitary
                  confinement, pining for the fresh air that struggles through the iron grate?
                  Cannot I love George, and <emph>like</emph> you, and fifty others too, if I
                  choose? I feel that I have a magnificently large heart."</p>
               <p>"Florence—L'éclair," cried he, earnestly; "though your heart were as large as the
                  whole universe, it should not have room for another love than mine, if I once
                  gained admittance there. I speak not of sisterly affection, friendship, or esteem.
                  I speak of love—such love as you were born to inspire, and I was born to
                  feel."</p>
               <p>"I wish you would not talk of love," said she, fluttering the leaves of a book she
                  held in her hand; "I want you to be my friend, my true and sincere friend. I want
                  you to tell me of my faults, as you did when we first met at the university; to
                  speak to me in that tone of beautiful, solemn earnestness, to make me feel that
                  you are above me, that I have something to reach after and attain. But don't go to
                  talking raptures, and so forth. Don't try to make me feel my power. I shall grow
                  wilful, haughty, and overbearing—and then"——</p>
               <p>"And then," said Marcus, with calm self-possession, "you would have no power over
                  me at all. The moment you tried to make me feel the weight of chains, I could
                  break them as easily as the unshorn giant did the green withes that bound
                  him."</p>
               <p>"I have always dreaded the idea of love," she said, more seriously; "because I
                  know, if I once yielded to its power, I should become far more of a vassal than
                  any slave on this broad plantation. There is something terrible to me in the
                  thought of giving one's happiness so completely in another's power; to hang
                  trembling, palpitating on the frail dependency of another's truth and constancy.
                  No!" she added, commanding the agitation of her voice, and waving back her
                  ringlets with sportive grace. "Let me follow my own volitions, for at least three
                  or four years to come; let me enjoy my emancipation from daily rules and
                  scholastic discipline; let my mind soar unfettered to the heights where I wish to
                  stand, and then perhaps, when I am more worthy of the heart's homage, I may be
                  tempted to wear those bonds, which, though covered with roses and seeming light as
                  air, must be stronger than steel, and heavier than iron."</p>
               <p>"Listen to me one moment, Florence," said he, taking her hand, and seating her
                  within the shadow of the scarlet curtains, while he sat down by her side. "We are
                  both very young, I know, but we may talk of the future, may we not?"</p>
               <p>"The future!" repeated she; "that seems a mighty shadow rolling far, far off."</p>
               <p>"Of the past, then—those lightning letters."</p>
               <p>"Ah! you promised never to allude to them."</p>
               <p>"I did not promise, Florence, though you required the bond. Those letters sealed
                  my destiny. They showed our minds were one. The divided unity has been brought
                  together by those electric sparks, and thinks, and feels, and glows in unison. It
                  was not chance that brought us together at the fountain's side. It was not an idle
                  whim that prompted you to write those kindling words. It was the impulse of the
                  soul seeking its kindred soul, the heart reaching after the mutual heart'</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC6692-00000066"/>
               <p>At this moment, when all the softness and sensibility of womanhood mellowed the
                  brightness of her countenance, and her lip trembled with unspoken words, Delaval
                  opened the door, and, laughing, was about to close it again. Florence sprang up
                  and detained him.</p>
               <p>"Your friend is too metaphysical for me," she said. "I cannot fathom him. He is a
                  Transcendentalist."</p>
               <p>"Well, I want him to take a ride on horseback with me over the plantation.
                     <emph>That</emph> will clear away the German mists from his brain. Supposing
                  you come with us. You will be a far better guide than I am, for there is not a
                  nook or dingle you have not explored."</p>
               <p>Away flew Florence, apparently as much excited at the thought of riding as if
                  there were no such thing as sentiment in the world. She soon appeared, equipped in
                  a dark riding-dress, and cap with black, drooping feathers. It looked like the
                  same she had worn when he first saw her, demurely waiting for her recreant pony;
                  but as she had grown since that period, it must have been another, made in a
                  similar fashion. Instead of the recreant brown pony, she mounted a beautiful white
                  horse, which displayed the dark outlines of her figure to great advantage. Wild
                  and fearless, she dashed ahead, regardless of obstructions, and mocking the speed
                  of her companions.</p>
               <p>"This is my life," said she to Marcus, as they paused to admire the rich rolling
                  expanse of the cotton-field, bearing the downy wealth of the South. "I am a far
                  better overseer than the one my uncle hires. The negroes will work better for
                  their young mistress than anybody else; and sometimes I jump from my horse and
                  pick cotton with the little negroes, to let them see how fast it can be done."</p>
               <p>"You must not do that any more, Florence," said Delaval. "It would do well enough
                  in the child, but not in the young woman, who is joint heiress of these noble
                  fields."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I do detest the idea of being a woman," exclaimed Florence. "I wish I could
                  always be a child. Mrs. Lewis is always telling me, 'Florence, you forget how old
                  you are growing ing; you must be steadier now.' Dear, stiff, formal uncle cries,
                  in his solemn accents, 'Niece, it is time that you remember the dignity and
                  responsibility of your station;' and even provoking George begins to tutor me, and
                  set me up on the stilts of womanhood and heiress-ship. Marcus, I hope you at least
                  will not preach me out of the wild freedom of childhood yet."</p>
               <p>There was something so extremely juvenile in her appearance, with her curls
                  wreathing and sporting with the feathers that drooped over her cheeks; such
                  freshness, and buoyancy, and life about her, that Marcus did think it would be a
                  pity to restrain that wild grace, and brush off that dewy bloom from her bright,
                  morning spirit. He was about to say as much, when she darted off in a new
                  direction, leaving no guide but a gay laugh ringing through the woods, by which to
                  follow her course.</p>
               <p>When they were returned they found a visitor had arrived during their absence,—a
                  young gentleman by the name of Pellam, whose father was a particular friend of Mr.
                  Alston, and who was well known to Delaval. Marcus could not help feeling a natural
                  recoil and disgust when he recognised the insolent stranger of the ferry-boat in
                  the new guest at Wood Lawn, and the bow with which he acknowledged the courteous
                  introduction of Delaval breathed the very soul of haughtiness. He could not help
                  it. He could not forget the scornful stare, the supercilious smile, the air of
                  conscious superiority, which had set all his passions boiling, on the waters of
                  the Chattahoochee. They all left the room to change their dress before supper, and
                  Marcus had time to reflect on the probable consequences of the meeting. He knew
                  the sovereign aristocracy of Mr. Alston would look down on the son of a ferryman
                  and overseer, whatever other claims he might have to consideration and regard.
                  Would Delaval be governed by such petty pride? Would Florence? He now regretted
                  the silence Mr. Bellamy had imposed on the subject. Had Delaval known all the
                  realities of his condition, and then invited him to his home, he could not fear
                  the arrogance that now threatened to annoy<pb n="134-135"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000067"/> him. He lingered in his room, fearing he might lose
                  his self-control in the presence of Florence, if he again met that insolent,
                  measuring glance of pride. Slowly he walked through the carpeted hall, and reached
                  the door of the drawing-room. Pellam and Mr. Alston were sitting with their backs
                  to the door; Delaval and Florence in an oblique direction. Neither observed the
                  approach of Marcus, so intent were they on the words of the speaker, who was
                  Pellam, the new guest.</p>
               <p>"I repeat," said he, emphatically, "that his father was a low ferryman, and is now
                  a common overseer. He was bred to the ferryman's trade. I saw him push the boat
                  myself. I heard the old negro talk about his father. I inquired, and found it was
                  all true. I am willing to take my oath upon its truth."</p>
               <p>"'Tis false," exclaimed Florence, in a passionate tone. "<emph>He</emph> brought
                  up in a ferryman's hut. <emph>His</emph> father an overseer, Never!"</p>
               <p>"This cannot be true," cried Delaval, indignantly. "I was with him three years in
                  college, and never heard a word of it before."</p>
               <p>Before the young man could reply, Marcus advanced into the room, and walking in
                  front of Pellam, said, in rather a husky tone of voice, "Is it of me you are
                  speaking, sir?"</p>
               <p>"It is," answered the young man, drawing back a few paces, and placing a chair
                  between him and Marcus.</p>
               <p>"Deny it, Marcus," cried Florence, "it is nothing but slander—we all know it
                  is."</p>
               <p>The earnestness with which Florence spoke; her excited countenance; the indignant
                  looks which Delaval darted towards Pellam; the cold, austere mien of Mr. Alston,
                  staggered the faith of Marcus in his own triumphant power to resist the prejudices
                  of education on the part of his friends, and the narrow pride of the man of wealth
                  and family. But he was glad the trial came when it did. He wanted to see the
                  innate nobility of Florence put to a shining test.</p>
               <p>"I cannot deny it," said he, folding his arms across his breast, "I cannot deny
                  what is truth, and nothing but the truth."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston rose with an air of offended dignity, "This is very surprising," said
                  he, "a very surprising case. I did not imagine my friend Bellamy would have
                  imposed on us in this manner. I, who have always been so particular to select
                  irreproachable companions for my nephew and niece, to be so grossly deceived!"</p>
               <p>He put his hands behind him, and walked across the room with an exceedingly
                  imposing demeanour.</p>
               <p>"I cannot allow a reflection to be cast on my noble, my excellent benefactor,"
                  cried Marcus, with warmth. "He wished me to conceal those circumstances in my
                  father's life connected with the story of his misfortunes and sorrows, and I
                  obeyed him. Perhaps, knowing the world better than myself, he was aware there were
                  some contracted minds, who, measuring me by their own narrow standard, would
                  expose me to the insults of this hour. But let me tell you, sir, that my father is
                  a man of birth equal to your own, and of an education inferior to none of the
                  magnates of the land. My mother was the daughter of a Virginia planter, who
                  boasted of the royal blood of Pocahontas flowing in her veins. Of the misfortunes
                  that impoverished my father, and induced him to seek the solitude of the river's
                  shore, I cannot—ought not to speak. If my young hand was taught to stem the
                  current of the rushing river, it has only been nerved with stronger power to
                  resist,"—here he cast a withering glance at Pellam, who was still intrenched
                  behind the mahogany chair,—"to resist the arrogance that would degrade, and the
                  haughtiness that would oppress. Mr. Bellamy, sir, visited us in the house of my
                  father's darkened fortunes, and seeing him to be a gentleman in education and
                  manners equal to himself, and taking an interest in my then boyish self, drew us
                  from the obscurity uncongenial to our character and talents. It is true my father
                  has assisted him in overseeing his plantation. It is true he has borne the heat
                  and burden of a day of care, in gratitude and fidelity to his<pb n="136-137"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000068"/> generous friend. But he is no hireling, eating the
                  bread earned by mercenary wages. He is the honoured friend, the revered companion,
                  the respected counsellor, the adopted brother of the first and best of men. If I
                  have concealed these circumstances, it is not that I am ashamed to avow them, but
                  because I have been bound by a promise during the years of my minority. I rejoice
                  that they are revealed. They reflect lustre on my father's present reputation, for
                  greater is he who has resisted temptation than the conqueror of nations. They give
                  beauty and dignity to the name of Bellamy, and they gild with honour, yea,
                  three-fold honour, my own springing laurels."</p>
               <p>Marcus spoke with a fervour and enthusiasm and strength that brought the burning
                  blood to his cheek and a burning fire to his eyes, and a trumpet tone to his
                  voice, that voice which was yet to ring like a silver clarion in the walls of his
                  country's capitol.</p>
               <p>Delaval sprang forward, and seizing Marcus by both hands, exclaimed, "Warland, you
                  are a glorious fellow—I always said you were. I like you better than I did before,
                  a thousand times better; and by the shade of Cicero, (this was Delaval's standing
                  oath,) I would fight my own brother, if I had one, who should dare to speak
                  disrespectfully of your father in my presence. Florence, tell him that you echo
                  your brother's feelings; let him not believe, for one moment, that you could be
                  swayed by mean and sordid influences."</p>
               <p>"I blush for the momentary pride I betrayed at first," cried Florence, with
                  blushing ingenuousness. "The circumstances, as he has explained them, have only
                  ennobled him in my estimation, and they who sought to lower have only elevated him
                  in my eyes."</p>
               <p>"Miss Delaval, you are too demonstrative," said Mr. Alston, with a stately wave of
                  his delicate hand. "I see no occasion for any expression of feeling on your part.
                  Remember, you have a dignity to maintain, a station to adorn."</p>
               <p>"Dignity—station!" repeated Florence, in a low, scornful tone, sheathing with
                  their long lashes the lightnings of her eyes. "They cannot squeeze my soul into a
                  thumb-screw; the familiars of the Inquisition could not do it."</p>
               <p>The supper-bell rang, and Mr. Alston, waving his hand to Mr. Pellam, who very
                  gladly led the way from the room, where he could not but feel he had disgraced
                  himself in his impotent attempt to depreciate another, turned to Marcus with
                  another wave of the hand; but Marcus stood still.</p>
               <p>"I sit not at your board, nor sleep under your roof again, sir," said he, in a
                  calm, respectful tone, "till I am requested to do it, as an equal to yourself,
                  your nephew, and the gentleman now your guest."</p>
               <p>"Warland, you are <emph>my</emph> guest," interrupted Delaval, hastily.</p>
               <p>"I was never deficient in the duties of hospitality," said Mr. Alston, "and I
                  invite you, as the guest of my nephew, to take your accustomed seat; by so doing,
                  I hope I neutralize the effect of any remarks that may have offended your
                  pride."</p>
               <p>With a stiff bow, he crossed the threshold, and Marcus, biting his lip and
                  smoothing his brow, took the arm of Delaval and went to the supper-table. He there
                  conversed with his usual ease with Mrs. Lewis, Delaval, and Florence, but he ate
                  nothing; and when the supper was concluded, he took Delaval apart.</p>
               <p>"We must leave to-morrow," said he, "at least, <emph>I</emph> must. Your uncle
                  does not look upon me as he did before, and the presence of this young man is
                  intolerable to me."</p>
               <p>"Not more so to you than to me," cried Delaval. "He is an upstart, a proud,
                  ignorant, thick-headed coxcomb, who has fixed his presumptuous eyes upon Florence,
                  caring for nothing but her wealth. He thought the proud heiress would look upon
                  you with disdain, after the knowledge he imparted. <emph>He</emph> aspire to such
                  a girl as Florence! When a frog catches the star that shines upon the pond, then
                  Florence will look down on him. Never mind my uncle, Warland; he can't unbend, his
                  back is too stiff. He never lost his perpendicularity in his life. Besides,
                     <emph>I</emph> am the real master here; he is only the guardian, and invested
                  with delegated rights."</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC6692-00000069"/>
               <p>"Nevertheless, we had better start in the morning. It is best that we should. A
                  few days more will make but little difference to you, and it may be of great
                  consequence to me."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am ready. I dare say you are right. But I do wish that blockheaded Pellam
                  had stayed away."</p>
               <p>They made their arrangements immediately. They were to start very early in the
                  morning, before the family rose, and bade their adieus before retiring for the
                  night. Florence, who would not sit down with Pellam, had taken a light and
                  withdrawn to the library, while Delaval and Marcus were making their hasty
                  preparations. There the young men followed her.</p>
               <p>"Florence," said Delaval, "we have come to bid you goodbye; we start in the
                  morning, at daybreak."</p>
               <p>"I thought so," said she, with an agitated voice. "You cannot wish to remain while
                  that intruding guest is here." She added this with an expression of the most
                  sovereign contempt.</p>
               <p>"We leave him to your tender mercies," said Delaval, "assured that you will not
                  forget what is due to the dignity of your station, as our sapient uncle so often
                  remarks."</p>
               <p>Marcus, when he was last in that library, had spoken freely and boldly to Florence
                  of the strong sympathy that drew them to each other; now, he was resolved to make
                  himself a name and fame before he addressed the young heiress in the language of
                  love. The time which would elapse before they again met would prove their minds
                  and hearts. He felt confidence in himself, confidence in her, but his eyes alone
                  betrayed the emotions he felt.</p>
               <p>"You will write often, George," said she, when the parting moment came. "You will
                  both write; will you not?"</p>
               <p>"I waited only for your permission," replied Marcus. "But may I not address you as
                  L'éclair, when I write? No other name will seem appropriate as a
                  correspondent."</p>
               <p>"Write as the spirit prompts," said Florence, with a brilliant blush. "I believe
                  in impulses, after all."</p>
               <p>Marcus felt his stoical resolutions melting away. It was evident that Florence
                  wished to convince him that malice had not shaken the hold he had on her esteem.
                  Never had she spoken so feelingly, so confidingly.</p>
               <p>"I don't like long good-byes," cried Delaval, "so God bless you, sweet sis, and
                  watch over you, till I see you again."</p>
               <p>Florence wept, as he clasped her in a warm, fraternal embrace, and clung to him in
                  unwillingness to let him go. He was her only brother, and two years of absence was
                  a long, long time, and perhaps other regrets which she dared not avow gave
                  intensity to her emotions. It was strange to see tears flowing from the sunbright
                  eyes of Florence, and Delaval wiped the moisture from his own several times.</p>
               <p>"Why, my brave sis," he cried, releasing himself from her arms, "this will rever
                  do. Reserve one kiss and one tear for Marcus, your other, better brother."</p>
               <p>Thus authorized, Marcus kissed the crimson cheek that rested a moment on his
                  shoulder. It was the first time <emph>his</emph> lips had given, or
                     <emph>her</emph> cheek received the kiss of love, and it <emph>was</emph> love,
                  the first, the only love that had ever warmed their young hearts.</p>

               <p>OUR young southerners found themselves, after a pleasant and expeditious journey,
                  on the granite hills of the North, mingling with the sons of those pilgrim
                  fathers, who centuries ago came in the strength of their faith and the sublimity
                  of their hopes, and <q>
                     <l>"Moored their bark on the wild New England shore."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The wall of division that seemed to separate them from the dwellers of the ruder
                  latitudes of our country sank lower and lower as they advanced into their green
                  and cultivated inland Paradises, for such they appeared in the rich garniture of
                  closing summer. While at the South, the commencement of<pb n="140-141"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000070"/> the autumnal season was marked by here and there a
                  pallid leaf and a crisping blade, there every thing was glowing with the
                  effulgence of vernal bloom.</p>
               <p>Judge Cleveland, who presided over the law school which the young men entered, had
                  been a classmate of Mr. Bellamy, who was educated at a northern university. The
                  friendship formed between the students had outlived the chilling influences of
                  time, separation, and opposing political interests. It was this which had induced
                  Mr. Bellamy to send his adopted son to the town where he dwelt, one of the most
                  beautiful and flourishing of the minor cities of the Eastern States.</p>
               <p>It must be acknowledged, that notwithstanding the warm encomiums Mr. Bellamy had
                  given the character of Judge Cleveland, the young southerners were imbued with
                  some of the peculiar prejudices of the region where they were born, against
                  northern coldness and reserve. They expected to find the hearts of the people
                  covered with a cake of ice, clear and pure, but cold, inevitably cold, and though
                  after a while it might break or melt, still the atmosphere around them must remain
                  chilling and repulsive. They expected to meet with strong and majestic intellects,
                  unrivalled powers of ratiocination, and concentration of thought intense as the
                  solar rays. But they did not expect the urbanity, the warmth, the genial kindness
                  with which Judge Cleveland met them at the door of his rural palace, nor the frank
                  and sunny welcome of his charming wife. They were to become members of the family,
                  and they were domiciliated at once, and invested with all the privileges of home.
                  It was indeed fortunate for them that their lines had fallen in such a place.
                  Judge Cleveland was one of those men who belong to mankind, not to the limited
                  portion that surrounded him. As the traveller, wherever he may be, mid northern
                  snows or southern blossoms, when he turns his eyes upon the illimitable firmament,
                  seems himself the central point of the universe, so does such a man appear to
                  those who feel his influence. No matter what position he assumes, he is still the
                  central point towards which the social rays converge. He was a patriot, a
                  philanthropist, and much did he mourn over the divided interests of the two
                  beautiful and flourishing regions of the common country. Could he, like the Roman
                  Curtius, have closed the widening chasm by throwing his own life into the abyss,
                  and seen with his dying eyes the yawning edges meeting over his crushed and
                  mangled limbs, he would gladly have done it, so dear to his heart was the union
                  which the blood of his fathers had cemented, and the spirit of Washington for ever
                  hallowed. All that he could he did, to stem the misguided zeal, that, espousing
                  the cause of one portion of the human race, would place the torch in the hand of
                  the incendiary, and the knife in the grasp of the assassin, and roll on a wave of
                  blood and flame over a fair and smiling land.</p>
               <p>Instantaneously did the judge win the confidence of the warm-hearted young men who
                  were placed under his charge. There was a mixture of majesty and mildness, of
                  gentleness and firmness in his appearance and manner, that was singularly
                  pleasing. If he spoke in the circle of home with the sweetness of woman's accents,
                  one felt that he could launch the thunderbolt of eloquence, at the legal tribunal.
                  If his large gray eye beamed with benevolence and tenderness on the domestic
                  shrine, still there was a latent spark in its centre, ready to flash and burn into
                  the very heart of the criminal arraigned before his bar.</p>
               <p>They were fortunate, too, in the location they had chosen for their transient home
                  in the North. There was no fairer, lovelier spot, among the fair, green fields of
                  New England. Mountains, whose empurpled mist rolled like a royal drapery round
                  them, over which the clouds cast their ermine mantle and the sunbeams a golden
                  fringe, guarded, with God-born strength, the sweet, luxuriant valley at their
                  feet. A magnificent river, the pride and glory of the Granite State, formed its
                  eastern boundary, and gladdened and fertilized with its clear, deep, rejoicing
                  waters, the tranquil landscape through which it flowed. Nature seemed clothed with
                  the freshness<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6692-00000071"/> and vigour of eternal
                  spring. It was impossible to believe those fields of living, dazzling green would
                  ere long be covered with a cold, white winding-sheet of snow; those blue,
                  bright-flowing waters bound with fetters of ice, and hard and unyielding as flint.
                  But it was even so; and notwithstanding the bleakness of the scenery and the
                  intense cold of the atmosphere, our young southerners enjoyed, with a keen zest,
                  the exhilarating pleasures of a northern winter. Perhaps a few extracts from their
                  letters to their southern friends would give their impressions in a more vivid
                  manner than any narrative could do.</p>
               <p>"On my soul, Florence," thus wrote Delaval to his sister, in the midst of snow,
                  and ice, and frost; "on my soul, I wish you were here. This is the very region for
                  one of your free, glad, brave spirit. I thought I should be shrunk into the
                  dimensions of a cubic inch, congealed into an impenetrable cake of ice; but never
                  did I feel a more extended sense of vitality, a fuller consciousness of jubilant
                  existence. I feel as if I could wrestle with the snow-spirit, and mock its
                  merriest gambols. If you only knew the rapture of a moonlight sleigh-ride! Last
                  night Marcus and myself joined a party, that went out about seven or eight miles
                  from here, to a dance. We were all in double sleighs, six in each, pretty closely
                  packed together in buffalo skins; and if you had seen the bright-eyed,
                  rosy-cheeked maiden who sat next to Marcus, to say nothing of the one at my right
                  hand, I fear a pang of jealousy would have shot through your bosom. I tell you,
                  bright heiress of Wood Lawn, the stars themselves don't shine more brilliantly, or
                  wink more mischievously, than the eyes of these northern damsels during these
                  moonlight rides through drifting snow, and the music of the bells that ring
                  multitudinously on the necks of the spirited horses is not more inspiring than
                  their joyous merriment. If it were not for a certain pair of down-dropping,
                  silk-shaded, love-diffusing, violet eyes at the South, that have irretrievably
                  stolen away my heart, I should certainly be captivated by some of these
                  high-spirited, whole-souled, warm-hearted hearted daughters of New England. I see
                  winter here is the season of hilarity and amusement. There has been a constant
                  succession of parties lately, mostly, I believe, in honour of your humble
                  servants. Warland is the lion of the season. That extraordinary attraction he
                  carries about him, that captivated at one glance a certain little wild, dark girl
                  of my acquaintance, that riveted me, when I first beheld him on the recitation
                  bench, dismal place as it was, draws magnetically toward him man, woman, and
                  child. I find my lesser lustre completely merged in his superior brightness. I
                  will give you an instance. The other night we attended a gathering at the
                  hospitable mansion of Judge Carlton. I shall never more prate of hospitality as if
                  it were the peculiar, the exclusive grace of the South. Never have I seen it more
                  cordially, nobly exercised, than in this land of snow. Perhaps you will say they
                  think we are the sons of rich southern nabobs, and court our wealth and alliance.
                  No such thing. There is less of the aristocracy of wealth here than at any place I
                  ever saw. The only sovereignty admitted is that of mind. And Judge Cleveland
                  really reigns on a throne, whose foundations are everlasting as the hills,—yea,
                  far more so; for the perpetual hills will bow, and the elements melt with fervent
                  heat; but the mind of man shares the eternity of the Being from whom it emanates.
                  That they should make an excitement about Warland is not surprising; but for me,
                  if I were made of gold and studded with diamonds, they could not cherish me more
                  kindly. But in his presence, as I said before, my fine gold is all dim. I have
                  lost the thread of my story. The other night at Judge Carlton's, when we entered
                  the room, the walls were all lined with living blossoms, blooming as gayly as if
                  it were all summer abroad. We sought the lady of the house, to pay our respects,
                  as in duty bound we ought. Of course, the eyes of the lady were fixed on the
                  splendid face and form of Warland, and beheld only <emph>his</emph> graceful bow,
                  though I am sure I put my best foot foremost on the occasion. After a while she
                  asked Warland, in a very sweet voice, 'How is your friend Mr.<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000072"/> Delaval? I hope he is not indisposed, that he did
                  not accompany you'—and there I was, right at his elbow, looking steadily at her
                  with my big black eyes. I was but a mote in the sunbeams—a little, twinkling
                  planet, lost in the effulgence of day. When we moved round among the living
                  blossoms, the sweet wall-flowers, that fluttered, as we approached, like roses at
                  the coming of the zephyrs, it was to him the fair heads inclined, toward him the
                  ringlets bowed. Perhaps here and there some very polite damsel would inquire, 'Why
                  Mr. Delaval did not come?' while I was looking at her unutterable things. To tell
                  the truth, so dearly do I love him, so ardently do I admire him, and so truly do I
                  honour him, that I should think meanly of her or him, who did not forget me in his
                  presence, unless it might be a sister of his, perchance. I would be willing to
                  make her an exception.</p>
               <p>"You ought to hear him when defending the rights of the South. You must not think,
                  because I speak of moonlight rides and gay <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >soirées,</foreign> that we court amusement at the expense of study. We are the
                  hardest students in the institution. I am obliged to study harder than Warland. He
                  seems to take in every thing, no matter how difficult or abstruse it may be, by a
                  kind of intuition. Instead of being obliged to toil up the rugged steeps of
                  knowledge step by step, he really has found a royal way. His spirit is plumed with
                  the pinions of the eagle, and bears him up toward the goal for which we are
                  panting below.</p>
               <p>"About a week ago Judge Cleveland gave a dinner to his students, and invited the
                  principal gentlemen of the place to meet us. When Mrs. Cleveland, who presided
                  with true southern grace and hospitality, had retired, the conversation gradually
                  assumed a political turn. There was one gentleman present whose prejudices against
                  the South are very bitter, and for whose opinions I have very little respect. Yet
                  he has reputed intellect, and a high standing in society. I saw him in earnest
                  conversation with Marcus. One by one, those who were conversing with others left
                  their companions and drew near the cynosure. I was anxious to become a listener
                  myself, for I saw that he was excited by the dark spot in his eyes and the slight
                  quiver of his lips, a peculiarity of his which gives great depth of expression to
                  his countenance when speaking. I know not what had been previously said, but the
                  first words I caught were these, evidently in answer to something advanced by his
                  antagonist:</p>
               <p>"'I do not pretend to justify those who first rolled this shadow on our land. My
                  conscience would not permit me to do it. The evil as it now exists is too widely
                  extended, too deeply rooted, to admit of the remedy you propose. You may eradicate
                  the weeds from your garden, the tares from your wheat, but this is like the
                  fibrous grass, so interwoven into the soil it binds together that you cannot tear
                  it up, without destroying the earth where it grows.'</p>
               <p>"'Better let it be destroyed at once,' said his opponent, 'than have it kept
                  together by such an unholy cement.'</p>
               <p>"'Time, the great rectifier of all human ills,' replied Marcus, with graceful
                  gravity, 'can alone accomplish the work. Every rash and hasty effort will only
                  make the operation more difficult and protracted. He who is actuated by
                  philanthropy and a sincere desire to ameliorate the condition of slaves, will only
                  deprive them of the blessings they already enjoy, and retard the period of their
                  emancipation. Should a servile war be the consequence, <emph>their</emph> ruin
                  would be inevitable, as well as the destruction of thousands of lovely and
                  innocent beings, whose claims to humanity seem forgotten in a wild and burning
                  zeal.'</p>
               <p>"'Those who live on the edge of a crater,' replied the gentleman, 'must expect to
                  be destroyed by the volcanic power that ejects the boiling lava. But such a state
                  of existence would not be life to me. It would be living death. I could neither
                  eat nor sleep with the groans of these unhappy creatures ringing in my ears; with
                  their tears moistening the bread their shackled hands were preparing for my lips.
                  I should expect every mouthful would choke me. I should expect my dreams would be
                  haunted by the spectres of accusing conscience.'</p>
               <p>"'I am very young,' said Warland, looking earnestly at the<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000073"/> group now gathered around him, 'and my words may
                  have less weight on that account; but, nevertheless, I hope their truth will be
                  their passport. Young as I am, I have been on many broad plantations, and
                  witnessed the discipline of hundreds and hundreds of slaves. I have seen them in
                  the household, I have seen them in the field, and seldom while engaged in their
                  labours have I heard one groan of anguish, or witnessed one tear of sorrow. They
                  sing and jest over their tasks, and wear far happier and more smiling faces than
                  the hired servants employed to perform your daily work. They are not taxed beyond
                  their strength and endurance. Self-interest alone, if no higher, better motive,
                  would induce the planter to husband the strength that is to till his soil and
                  gather in its wealth. That there are instances where the master abuses his power,
                  and the African feels the heavy weight of bondage, I do not doubt; for where is
                  the social or political institution which tyranny has not abused and power
                  perverted? The taskmaster of your factories often oppresses the pale operative
                  that toils over the loom, and the master of a household sometimes rules with an
                  iron rod. I only contend for the general law of kindness and humanity.'</p>
               <p>"'Still, you must acknowledge,' continued the gentleman, 'that the only bond
                  existing between the enslaver and the slave must be exerted power on one side and
                  enforced obedience on the other.'</p>
               <p>"'No, sir,' exclaimed Warland, with a heightening colour, and his fine voice
                  swelling like a rich, deep-toned instrument. 'I acknowledge no such thing. There
                  is the bond of affection, of gratitude, tenderness, and esteem. The dark
                  background of slavery exhibits some of the most beautiful and touching traits of
                  the southern character, and into that dark ground itself are wrought some of the
                  brightest and softest colours that adorn the landscape of life. Allow me to speak
                  of my own experience. In very early years, myself and infant sister were deprived
                  of a mother's care, and peculiar circumstances threw us on the kindness and
                  fidelity of a negro nurse. With all a mother's self-sacrificing tenderness she
                  watched over and cherished us, and with true filial and devoted love have we
                  repaid her maternal cares. The fair hands of my adopted mother, the mistress of
                  more than a hundred slaves, are now scarred by the flames, into which she plunged
                  them to save the life of a poor mulatto girl whom she tenderly loved.'</p>
               <p>"'This is indeed a very uncommon instance,' said the gentleman, 'but there are
                  some noble, self-sacrificing beings who redeem the selfishness of a whole
                  generation. There are some even in Sardis who have not defiled their
                  garments.'</p>
               <p>"'This is not a solitary example. I could tell of many more,' cried my friend,
                  'but I fear I am engrossing the conversation, and transgressing the limits of
                  youthful modesty.'</p>
               <p>"I wish, Florence, you could have seen the graceful blush that mantled over the
                  face of the young champion of our institutions, as he looked on the eager
                  listeners who were gathering close round the charmed ring.</p>
               <p>"'No, no,' exclaimed several voices, 'pray go on, we are deeply interested in
                  hearing. Give us facts, they are more convincing than rhetoric.'</p>
               <p>"'On the river whose rapid current made the music of my boyhood,' continued
                  Warland, 'there was a burning boat. Among those who were exposed to a fiery death
                  there was only one lady, accompanied by a negro girl. The pilot, who chanced to be
                  a negro, with a chivalry that would have done honour to a white man, rushed to the
                  lady, and told her if she would suffer him to fasten a rope round her body, and
                  attach it also to his own, he could save her life. "And my girl too," cried she,
                  turning to the poor negro, who was clinging to her side. "I sorry, mistress, I
                  cannot take but one." "Then I die with her," said the heroic woman. "I cannot
                  leave her to perish. Save yourself. I ask not life on such terms." The African,
                  more anxious than ever to rescue one so disinterested and humane, made superhuman
                  exertions, and bore them both in safety through the roaring flames and the
                  whelming waves. This is only one of a thousand instances that might be brought
                     forward<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC6692-00000074"/> ward to prove the strong
                  affection existing between those whom the Almighty has distinguished by the
                  midnight hue and the tints of morning. Delaval, why are you silent? You might
                  speak volumes, for you have myriads under your own sway.'</p>
               <p>"What could I say to add any force to his eloquent relation of facts? Yet, thus
                  called upon, I could not help stepping forward to join in the disputation. Judge
                  Cleveland, I observed, had listened with intense interest to this conversation,
                  and his large, gray eyes grew luminous as Warland spoke.</p>
               <p>"'I cannot speak of myself,' said I, with becoming modesty, 'as I have not taken
                  the reins in my own hands, but I certainly have the best intentions to carry out
                  my father's benevolent discipline. When he was on his death-bed, one of his
                  latest, most solemn injunctions to me was, to be kind to the slaves he committed
                  to my care. "Remember, my son," he cried, with deep solemnity, "that you must give
                  an account of <emph>your</emph> stewardship, as I am about to render mine; and I
                  can say, in the prospect of death and eternity, that I have never voluntarily
                  caused a tear to flow." My uncle, who is now delegated with the authority that
                  will soon be mine, is a just man, (though my friend here will tell you a most
                  sovereign aristocrat,) and I most certainly, in all honesty and sincerity, intend
                  to obey the injunctions of my lamented father. I wish you would visit us, sir,
                  after my return to the South, and if I do not prove a second Nero or Henry the
                  Eighth, who, though very promising youths, became the most horrible tyrants, I
                  will show you a collection of smiling, black faces, that will have more eloquence
                  than a hundred tongues like mine.'</p>
               <p>"'Thank you,' said the gentleman. 'I should like very much to witness such a state
                  of things as you describe. But if they are really happy, why do we see so many
                  fugitives trying to escape from their bonds?'</p>
               <p>"'Why, the world is full of runaways of every kind,' answered I. 'There is many a
                  truant schoolboy that eludes his task; many a recreant from the authority of home;
                  and many a young miss that makes a moonlight flitting. But there are innumerable
                  examples of those who have resisted the strongest allurements to remain in a land
                  of freedom, and preferred the service of their masters to being aliens in a
                  strange home.'</p>
               <p>"'There is one thing I would like to hear you explain, my young friend,' continued
                  he, turning to Warland, who had drawn back so as not to veil my dawning
                  brightness. 'You observed these bondmen exhibited more cheerfulness than those
                  whom we employ to fill subordinate stations in our household, though they toil for
                  others without hope of remuneration. I should like to hear you explain the
                  principle that animates them.'</p>
               <p>"'Your servants, as far as I understand,' cried Warland, 'are ever changing,
                  seldom remaining long in the service of the same family. The prospect of higher
                  wages will induce them to leave the kindest and best of friends. There is seldom
                  time given for the formation of binding attachments. While the negro, who is born
                  in the household of his master, and brought up with his children, feels identified
                  with its interests by all those powerful associations which are twined round the
                  heart in the morning of life. It is true he toils for his master, but he is fed,
                  and clothed, and sheltered, without care or forethought of his own. In sickness he
                  is nursed; in old age protected; free from those anxious misgivings for the
                  future, which oppress the hearts of their owners. Oh! believe me, sir, we are
                  strangely misunderstood. I would not for the sovereignty of worlds attempt to
                  remove your prejudices by the sacrifice of <emph>truth;</emph> but when it
                  inspires and sustains me in all I utter, I could go on and speak volumes on the
                  subject, if the memory of my youth and position did not warn me to forbear.' <q>

                  administering to the comfort of one who had so often nursed and watched over your

               <p>We would like to transcribe some of the letters of Marcus, but Florence kept them
                  under lock and key, in a beautiful rosewood cabinet, and allowed no one to peruse
                  them. Hers were as jealously secluded from the curious eye, and though not bearing
                  the signature of Lightning, were written on the same delicate tissue, and
                  breathing the same delicious perfume.</p>
               <p>Marcus had not forgotten to vindicate Delaval, in his letters to Katy, from the
                  aspersions he had cast upon him, and it is possible Delaval enclosed some missive
                  of his own in the brother's epistles, for they were generally quite
                  imposing-looking packets; not only those which were sent, but those which were
                  received in return. We would like to present this correspondence to the reader,
                  especially that part which describes the glorious awakening of Nature from her
                  wintry lethargy, the escape of the glad river from bondage, when in all the joy of
                  emancipation it broke asunder its icy fetters, and dashed them a glittering wreck
                  upon its bosom; the carnation of the mountains when they resumed the regalia of
                  spring, and the valley, clothed like a bride, in a silver drapery of mist, lay
                  smiling and bashful at their feet.</p>
               <p>Yes, grand and magnificent is the return of spring in the northern latitudes. It
                  comes like a conqueror bearing the trophies of victory, its path strewed with
                  roses, and its brow crowned with garlands of green. A voice, as of many waters,
                  heralds its approach, and winter, bound in flowery chains, follows its triumphal
                  car.</p>

               <p>IT is said, that a course of uninterrupted prosperity hardens the heart of man,
                  and makes him forgetful of the Giver of every good and perfect gift; that he
                  buildeth fine palaces and lordly barns, and saith, with haughty self-elation,
                  "Soul, make merry with thy goods, and enjoy without fear the long banquet of
                  life." It is not always so. Mr. Bellamy's heart was not the clay that bakes and
                  indurates in the sunshine, in which no seed will germinate, no vegetation take
                  root. It was a sunny slope that produced the richest fruit and verdure, because
                  the beams shed warmth on its surface, and it radiated them back to the atmosphere.
                  The more prosperous he was, the more grateful was he to God, the more benevolent
                  to his fellow-man.</p>
               <p>Marcus had been absent more than a year. An unusually abundant season had crowned
                  the hopes of the planter, and the cotton-bolls, opened by a fervid sun, were
                  gathered without being exposed to any of those autumnal rains which so often<pb
                     n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6692-00000076"/> destroy the harvest-bloom. Indeed, it
                  had been singularly dry, and now that the earth had given in its increase, nothing
                  would have been considered a greater blessing than a shower to sprinkle the dusty
                  shrubbery and the thirsty earth. The moon shone with a crimson hue through the dry
                  and powdery atmosphere, and Aunt Milly said it was a certain sign that something
                  was going to happen, when it had that bloody colour. She did hope it was not to
                  Master Marcus. The family sat in the piazza, and Katy, as she watched the
                  blood-red orb slowly rolling up above the skirts of the woods, wondered if a pair
                  of deep-black eyes, distant from her own, were gazing on its disk, and if their
                  master were thinking of <emph>her.</emph> Mrs. Bellamy leaned back in the chair in
                  serene silence, while Mr. Bellamy and Warland sat and talked on themes of mutual
                  interest. The strains of Hannibal's violin were heard in the back yard, and some
                  little nimble-footed negroes were jumping <emph>Georgia motion,</emph> and making
                  the dust fly like ashes over their heads. Several old negroes were sitting round
                  the doors of their cabins, smoking their pipes and shaking their heads knowingly
                  at each other at some sage remark wafted to their ears.</p>
               <p>"I know not why it is," said Mr. Bellamy, "but I sometimes feel sad from the very
                  excess of my contentment. I feel the impossibility of such a state of things
                  always lasting. I have been so blessed, so favoured by Providence, that dark days
                  must be in store for me, for I cannot expect to be exempt from the common lot.
                  About the time I first visited your cabin, Mrs. Bellamy was in delicate health,
                  and I felt anxious on <emph>her</emph> account. That cloud passed away, and left
                  the horizon clear. Ever since then I have prospered. I believe your coming among
                  us, Warland, you and your children, brought a blessing on the household. You have
                  been an able coadjutor, a wise and faithful friend. I wonder now how I ever got
                  along without you."</p>
               <p>"I am sure <emph>I</emph> found the blessing here," replied Warland, with grateful
                  emotion. "This has been the gate of heaven to me. The events of that night, which
                  brought you under my roof, were arranged by Infinite Wisdom and Infinite Mercy
                  too. When I think what I then was, and what I now am; when I remember what you
                  have done for my children,—my sweet Katy, my noble Marcus,—my heart swells; I find
                  no room for words."</p>
               <p>"Speak not of what I have done. I have been repaid a thousand-fold already. What
                  we do for ourselves is like water spilled upon the sand; what we do for others
                  like the dew on the grassy plain. I know, when I come to my dying hour, the memory
                  of what I have been enabled to do, to promote the happiness of my fellow-beings,
                  will linger when all selfish enjoyments have passed away. I have never met with
                  one instance of treachery or ingratitude in man. I have never suffered from those
                  destroying elements which have often laid waste the hopes of others. Fire has
                  never consumed my buildings, nor floods deluged my lands. Pestilence has never
                  swept off my negroes, nor mutiny stolen into their ranks. God has certainly been
                  very gracious to me. I feel oppressed by the weight of his unmerited
                  goodness."</p>
               <p>Mr. Bellamy paused and raised his eyes above, with reverential devotion, seeing in
                  the moon, now rising higher and higher above the dust of earth, her crimson
                  radiance melting into gold, an image of that divine love whose influence he so
                  deeply flelt. We dwell on this evening's tranquil scenes, because so terrible a
                  contrast was about to be presented. Katy, unable to resist the attraction of
                  Hannibal's violin, ran into the back yard, where the <emph>Georgia motion</emph>
                  was still kept up with unwearied vivacity. Katy did not join the performers, but
                  she danced round Hannibal, who sat under a China tree, with the moon glimmering
                  through the boughs on his shining, coal-black face, which was now bent obliquely
                  over his instrument, then raised enthusiastically and thrown back in a horizontal
                  direction. He always seemed inspired when playing, and nothing delighted him so
                  much as to see the nymphlike figure of Katy floating with gossamer grace on his
                  evening serenades. He always said she danced just like Cora, and<pb n="154-155"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000077"/> "she looked sorter like her too, only if she had
                  black eyes instead of blue, and black hair instead of brown, and had a
                     <emph>leetle</emph> darker skin, the likeness would be more complete."</p>
               <p>Katy was the darling of all the negroes, from the Carthaginian General down to the
                  smallest child that rolled under the hickory's shade. This night she seemed
                  animated with unwonted hilarity, for her mood was usually quiet and serene. She
                  danced from cabin to cabin, regardless of the dust that sprinkled her white muslin
                  robes; and picturesque did those white cabins look, in the mellow lustre that now
                  bathed them. The whitewashed walls, in the illusion of moonlight, had the
                  smoothness and richness of marble; and the dark figures grouped about their steps
                  might have passed for antique statues of bronze, or monuments of Egyptian art.</p>
               <p>"What make Miss Katy so gay this night?" said Aunt Milly, who had some religious
                  scruples against dancing. "She piert as a kitten. Somehow or other I think
                  something going to happen. Looking-glass broke up in mistress's room to-day,
                  nobody know how. 'Twas a sperrit, sure enough, and a warning. If we had an
                  intarpreter like Nabunezzar, who told about the hand that figured on the wall,
                  we'd know what it do mean."</p>
               <p>"Sufficient to the day is the evil thereof, Aunt Milly," cried Katy, waltzing
                  round her tall turban. "I suspect the spirit had a dusting-brush in its hand, and
                  was looking at itself too hard, when the glass shivered. But hark! there's a
                  breeze rustling among the leaves, and there is a cloud floating below the moon. We
                  will surely have rain to-morrow."</p>
               <p>The breeze which blew from the north raised such a cloud of dust that Katy was
                  glad to escape into the shelter of the house, and when the family retired to their
                  slumbers, they looked forward to a renovating shower. No one but Aunt Milly had a
                  presentiment of evil, though it was brooding darkly and luridly over the fated
                  mansion. All slept deeply, securely, lulled by the murmurs of the rising wind. But
                  the deep sleep of Mr. Bellamy began to change to an uneasy slumber. He dreamed
                  that he was in a trackless wilderness, in the midst of midnight darkness, and that
                  a heavy, roaring sound, as of wild beasts in the heart of that wilderness, weighed
                  upon his ears, when the darkness was suddenly illuminated by a thousand blazing
                  eyes, gleaming through the shadows, making a living and terrible conflagration.
                  With a convulsive start, he shook off the nightmare under which he was gasping,
                  and sprang up. He was awake; but the same dull, roaring sound was in his ears. He
                  was awake; but the blazing eyes were glaring through the window, blazing tongues
                  were curling and hissing abroad; and mingling with the roar were the cries,
                  shouts, and shrieks of suddenly-awakened voices, while one loud as a trumpet and
                  deep as a drum pealed high above the rest, "Master—master—fire!—fire!—wake up,
                  master—wake"—</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy started from the bed with a scream of horror. The voice of Hannibal
                  seemed rolling and echoing all round the room.</p>
               <p>"Isabel! Isabel!" exclaimed Mr. Bellamy, who had thrown his dressing-gown round
                  him, and rushed toward the windows to ascertain the extent of the calamity. "The
                  flames are upon us! My God! how shall I save you? The staircase, it must be on
                  fire!"</p>
               <p>Seizing her hand and throwing one arm round her, for she was paralyzed with
                  terror, he opened the door that led toward the stairs, when the hot, scorching air
                  drove him backward. The flames that were roaring below came rushing and leaping
                  upward, licking the banisters with their long red tongues, then darting them
                  forward like fiery serpents, whose huge convolutions were rolling and doubling
                  behind. The floor quaked beneath their feet, the glass shook, the walls vibrated.
                  Mrs. Bellamy fell heavily on the arm of her husband. She had fainted.</p>
               <p>"God of mercy!" gasped Mr. Bellamy, dragging her toward the open window, where the
                  flames glared luridly on her pallid face; "I can't save her. She's lost. We are
                  both lost. Poor Isabel!" Then with a sudden energy he lifted his voice, crying
                  out, "A ladder! for the love of God, a ladder!"</p>
               <p>Before the words had left his lips, a heavy sound, as of a<pb n="156-157"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000078"/> falling body against the wall, was followed by an
                  apparition, that, seen at the open window, on the background of fire, so tall, so
                  black, so powerful, with blazing eyes and gleaming teeth, it looked like an
                  archangel of darkness, coming on pinions of flame. "Mistress! mistress!" it
                  exclaimed; "Hannibal come to save mistress, or die too."</p>
               <p>The faithful slave beheld the death-like face of his mistress drooping back from
                  the arm of his master, and springing in through the window, he caught her, like an
                  infant, in his strong arms, and disappeared, shouting, "Come along, master; come
                  'long, 'fore he burn up."</p>
               <p>Mr. Bellamy looked out, and beheld Hannibal leaping from round to round of the
                  ladder he had placed against the wall, the white night-dress of his mistress
                  waving and fluttering against his black figure, the flames reflecting on both a
                  supernatural glare. How he followed he knew not, but he reached the ground just as
                  the ladder, that had tottered at every step, slipped and fell, and he found
                  himself in the grasp of Warland, who was calling in frantic accents for his
                  daughter. Katy slept in a room back of Mrs. Bellamy's, farther removed from the
                  fire; her father in the room below. In his agonizing fears for his wife, Mr.
                  Bellamy had forgotten poor Katy, and now he repeated her name in accents of
                  despair. At that moment a piercing shriek from the window they had just quitted
                  cut them through the heart, for there she stood, stretching out her arms, and they
                  could see the hot flames behind, ready to leap upon her. The paralyzed hands of
                  the father tried in vain to lift the heavy ladder, but swift as lightning Hannibal
                  sprang into their midst, and adding his mighty strength, lifted it as if it were a
                  feather's weight, threw it against the wall, and vaulting upon it, was
                  instantaneously on the topmost round. Katy threw herself into his arms with a wild
                  appeal to the mercy of heaven. Poor Milly, who always slept in the same room with
                  Katy, but who had remained that night in the cabin of Hannibal's mother, who was
                  suffering from the rheumatism, was perfectly frantic during her darling's danger.
                  She rolled on the ground, screaming, and biting the earth, in the impotence of
                  despair. The negroes were rushing to and fro, doing all they could to save their
                  master's property and check the progress of the flames. They had always been
                  accustomed to follow the leading of Hannibal, and that he should have the glorious
                  privilege of rescuing his mistress and Katy from death, seemed as natural as to
                  see him at the head of the field, the first to plant, and the first to reap.</p>
               <p>"Look a there," cried the black angel of preservation, pointing to the window
                  above, while he bore Katy, who still clung trembling to his neck, toward the spot
                  where he had left his mistress, "see him coming? Run away back, every one of
                  you—way off; he fall, he kill you dead as stone. Master, come away; don't you see
                  him"——</p>
               <p>The fire was, indeed, now rolling in reddening volumes through every window of the
                  house, and howling tempestuously within. The northern wall of the building began
                  to rock, and lean, and part, and then fall with a terrible crash. The imprisoned
                  flames leaped up to the very heavens, and went roaring above the old hickories,
                  whose scorched and blackened trunks looked like gloomy pillars to a vast dome of
                  fire. Nothing was now to be done but to gaze on the ruin, so awfully grand, while
                  the element that was working such destruction was clothing it in such dread
                  magnificence. The cabins on the south side of the house shared in the
                  conflagration; those on the north, the direction from which the wind blew,
                  escaped. The fire had evidently commenced in the northern wing of the building,
                  and had gained the mastery of it before it was discovered. The wings were of wood,
                  not brick, like the main body of the house, and being dry from a long exposure to
                  unmitigated sunshine, kindled like a light-wood knot.</p>
               <p>Hannibal had selected a strange place to bear his insensible mistress; but he
                  believed, if the flames should cover every inch of Hickory Hill beside, it would
                  leave untouched and unscathed the grave of Cora. He believed that the angels
                  guarded it; he had seen them himself, with the eye of superstition, flitting<pb
                     n="158-159" xml:id="VAC6692-00000079"/> ting round it, and spreading out their
                  white wings over the face of the monument, with a soft, rustling sound. It might
                  have been the monument itself, that, gleaming white in the moonlight, Hannibal
                  mistook for spreading wings. It might have been the sighing of the willow-boughs,
                  and the long grass in the night-breeze, that he mistook for the feathery motion of
                  an angelic plume; but his own belief was immovable as a rock, and when he laid his
                  mistress by the grave of the poor mulatto she had endeavoured to save from the
                  same destroying element from which he had just rescued <emph>her,</emph> he
                  thought no harm could reach her there. Gently laying her down, so that her head
                  rested on the green mound, he ran for water to revive her, when the shrieks of
                  Katy and the frantic cries of her father again directed him to the burning
                  building. A negro woman, who was hurrying about the cabins, like a distracted
                  creature, throwing teacups and saucers to the ground, and hugging pillows
                  carefully in her arms, caught a glimpse of the white-robed, prostrate figure
                  stretched upon the grave, and screaming out, "A sperrit, a sperrit!" came very
                  near rushing into the flames, to escape the spectre her own imagination had
                  raised. It was her wild outcry, and the horrified glances she rolled over her
                  shoulder toward the spot, that led Mr. Bellamy to know where his wife was borne,
                  and he could not wonder at the terrors of the superstitious negro, when he looked
                  upon her face, as cloudless as the stone near which she rested, and her long loose
                  wrapper lying around her, like the folds of a winding-sheet. Raising her in his
                  arms, he was bearing her from the melancholy spot, when he met Hannibal with the
                  rescued Katy, whom he was bringing also under the outspread wings of Cora's
                  guardian angels.</p>
               <p>"No, master—please, master, don't take mistress 'way; no fire come here; no
                  nothing to hurt. I bring water, I bring blanket; she no where else to go."</p>
               <p>"Alas, alas!" exclaimed Mr. Bellamy, "it is too true. We have no shelter left. The
                  cabins still standing would not be safe places of retreat."</p>
               <p>Katy, whose senses, instead of forsaking her, had become intensified by the agony
                  of fear, assisted Mr. Bellamy in the restoration of her benefactress. The water
                  which Hannibal brought, and with which they copiously bathed her face and hands,
                  soon recalled her to recollection and to a knowledge of the calamity that had
                  befallen them.</p>
               <p>"God be praised," were her first words, seeing her husband on one side and Katy on
                  the other, while Hannibal, standing at her feet, intercepted the blaze of her
                  dwelling. "My husband is spared—my own dear child!"</p>
               <p>Hannibal, who had begun to fear that it was only the dead body of his mistress he
                  had borne into that sacred inclosure, so long and deep was her insensibility,
                  clapped his hands joyfully together, and the big drops came splashing down his
                  cheeks, all glistening with perspiration.</p>
               <p>"Who saved me?" she cried, sitting up, and looking round her with a bewildered
                  air. "Ah, I remember now. It was you, my husband. You carried me down the burning
                  staircase."</p>
               <p>"No, Isabel; that passage would have been our grave. <emph>There</emph> stands the
                  preseryer of your life and mine, and hers too. We should all have been burnt to
                  cinders now, if it had not been for Hannibal. <emph>He</emph> scaled the
                     walls—<emph>he</emph> snatched you from the flames—<emph>he</emph> showed me
                  the way of escape. Again he perilled his life for that poor shrieking girl, who
                  was about to leap from the window, death behind and before her. Isabel, in the
                  hands of God, <emph>he</emph> has been our Saviour. How shall we thank him? how
                  shall we reward him?"</p>
               <p>"I no want thanks. I no want any thing. I too happy already. My heart 'most ready
                  to burst," cried Hannibal, drawing the back of his hand over his brimming
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"Hannibal," said his mistress, leaning forward and extending her hand eagerly
                  towards him, "Hannibal, come near me?"</p>
               <p>The tall slave approached his still reclining mistress. He could not reach the
                  hand she held towards him without kneeling, and with a sudden but not ungraceful
                  genuflection, he bent<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6692-00000080"/> over her, while
                  her pale fingers tried to clasp his hard and jetty hand.</p>
               <p>"God bless you, Hannibal," she cried in a voice half choked with emotion, "and He
                  will bless you. He will bless you in heaven. But, what shall we do for you on
                  earth? Ask any thing of us—any thing left us to bestow. Freedom shall be yours,
                  Hannibal, from this moment. I know your master's heart as well as my own. I speak
                  for him too."</p>
               <p>"Yes!" repeated Mr. Bellamy with warmth, "your heart does speak for me. Hannibal,
                  you are free—your mother too. I wish I had a greater boon to bestow, and it should
                  be yours."</p>
               <p>The negro bowed his head on his breast, and wept aloud. The gentle Katy sobbed
                  with him.</p>
               <p>"I wish <emph>I</emph> had something to give you, Hannibal," said she, "but I will
                  love you as long as I live."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk so to Hannibal, mistress. Please, master; please, Miss Katy, don't. He
                  can't stand it. He no want freedom. He stay with you all, all his born days; and
                  when he die he want you to bury him 'long side of Cora, where he lay you down this
                  night. Oh! mistress, when I see you put your hands in the live blaze to save poor
                  Cora, I vow 'fore my Heavenly Master I'd die for you and master jist for that.
                  Don't send me away. I work for you as long I live."</p>
               <p>A slight shriek from Mrs. Bellamy startled them all. "My hand is covered with
                  blood," she cried, holding out her dripping fingers. "Hannibal, it is yours."</p>
               <p>"Me! mistress. Sure enough," cried the negro, holding out his right arm, from
                  which the blood was now perceptibly flowing from the shoulder to the hand. "I no
                  know nothing 'bout it 'fore."</p>
               <p>It was evident that he had received a severe wound on the shoulder, probably from
                  a piece of falling timber, but in the excitement of the scene was unconscious of
                  the injury.</p>
               <p>"Your mother's cabin still stands," said Mrs. Bellamy, "and it is so far from the
                  flames we can venture there the back way. Let us all go there, and we can dress
                  Hannibal's wound. Poor fellow! to think he never knew it."</p>
               <p>Grateful that any shelter remained to which they could turn, the houseless master
                  and mistress of that late noble mansion sought the dwelling of the aged slave,
                  who, forgetting her rheumatic pains in the horrors of the night, had been hobbling
                  about trying to help the others. There Mrs. Bellamy bound up Hannibal's bleeding
                  arm; then, overcome with fatigue and the anguish of her feelings, sank down upon
                  the bed of his mother.</p>
               <p>Desolate was the dawning of the morning. The rain, so long invoked as a blessing,
                  began to descend on the smouldering ruins, making the "blackness of ashes" still
                  blacker, and the thick gloom still more gloomy. The negroes crowded together in
                  the remaining cabins, weary from their exertions and sad from their loss; leaning
                  on their elbows, and gazing vacantly on the blackened walls and the fallen ruins.
                  King, who had laboured faithfully for his master during the fire, and saved a
                  valuable cabinet of papers at imminent risk; who had seen his own nice cabin burnt
                  to ashes, sat mournfully by his coal-black Pinkey, who was sobbing over her
                  misfortunes. He was terribly reminded of the fate of poor Cora, whom he had once
                  so devotedly loved, and lived over the scene of his ill-starred bridal night.</p>
               <p>Mr. Bellamy and Warland, sitting on a bed of cotton in the gin, thus sheltered
                  from the rain, made plans for the future, and had already built in anticipation
                  another and more splendid habitation.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy and Katy were sleeping in each other's arms on the negro's
                  comfortable bed. Milly had placed clean pillows under them, and spread over them a
                  new white counterpane, treading on tiptoe lest she should chase their slumbers.
                  Hannibal, whose arm became every moment more painful, but who disdained to give
                  expression to his sufferings, leaned back against the wall, with his teeth pressed
                  tight against each other, so that a groan could not escape that might wake his
                  mistress</p>
               <p>It was in this situation Doctor Manning found them, who<pb n="162-163"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000081"/> being called out early on professional business,
                  became aware of the misfortune of his friends, and hastened to proffer his
                  services. He found the arm of Hannibal, which he was immediately requested to
                  examine, had sustained a very serious injury. The doctor had felt a strong
                  interest in this negro since the night he had made a clean conscience by
                  confessing to him his secret sins; and now, when informed of his noble
                  self-devotion, his interest deepened into respect and admiration.</p>
               <p>"Why, my brave fellow," said he, "you have a very bad hurt here. How and when did
                  it happen?"</p>
               <p>"I don't know nothing 'bout it, sir," answered Hannibal. "Didn't know I was hurt
                  till mistress saw the blood on her own fingers."</p>
               <p>"But this threatens to be a serious matter," said the doctor, with a countenance
                  so expressive of anxiety, Hannibal began to tremble—not from the dread of pain,
                  but a more horrible dread, the loss of that strong right arm, the sceptre of
                  authority among his sable brethren.</p>
               <p>"Oh! doctor, you are going to cut off my arm. Good master doctor please, you not
                  going to do no such thing. If I got to die, I must, but I'd rather die twenty
                  times over than live with this here arm in the grave afore me, I had. I don't want
                  to live no longer than I work."</p>
               <p>"Be quiet, my good fellow," said the doctor, involuntarily smiling at Hannibal's
                  look of unutterable horror. "My fingers are not knives. They cannot cut you. I
                  hope and trust there will be no need of robbing you of such an honourable member
                  as this."</p>
               <p>"I die fust, doctor—'deed I will."</p>
               <p>"We must keep down the inflammation," continued the physician, with an air of
                  authority, which did not lose sight of kindness, yet claimed obedience from his
                  subject. "You must be perfectly still, and be very careful of what you eat and
                  drink."</p>
               <p>"I starve 'fore I lose this arm," said the excited general.</p>
               <p>"Why, Hannibal, I have not threatened you with the loss of your arm. I only said
                  it was a serious matter, and so it is."</p>
               <p>"You look so sharp, doctor. You look as if you going to cut me."</p>
               <p>The doctor laughed outright. Hannibal's interpretation of Doctor Manning's
                  expression showed the power of association in a most remarkable manner. Nothing
                  could be more genial than his countenance, more bland and gentle than his manner,
                  but since he had been compelled to amputate the limb of one of Hannibal's black
                  friends, he had looked upon him with fear and trembling. It gives us pleasure to
                  say that his skill was availing in this instance, and that the noble arm of
                  Hannibal was spared the terrible gash of the amputating knife.</p>
               <p>Bellamy Place was at least two miles from the nearest plantation, but before noon,
                  several carriages arrived, to bear the family to the homes of their friends. Mrs.
                  Bellamy did not like to leave Hannibal, and indeed refused to do so; but Aunt
                  Milly, who was the queen of nurses, promised to watch over him with the tenderest
                  care, and she knew Dr. Manning would be assiduous in his attentions.</p>
               <p>It was pleasant to be surrounded once more with all the comforts and elegancies of
                  life, though no longer their own; to be clothed in nice and handsome garments,
                  though not their own. All their wardrobe was burned. They had saved nothing from
                  the wreck but their night-raiments that covered them. Most of the furniture, too,
                  was destroyed; but the money and papers were saved. The cotton was spared; their
                  negroes remained. The loss was comparatively small to what it might have been. Now
                  they had leisure to reflect upon the manner in which the fire had been
                  communicated. As it was still sultry, there had been no fire kindled in the house,
                  and yet the north wing had taken fire, evidently in the lower part. Mr. Bellamy
                  remembered smoking a pipe in that room before retiring to bed, and rapping out the
                  contents of the bowl on the hearth. The wind must have blown a coal in contact
                  with some combustible material, and thus lighted the wrath of an element,<pb
                     n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6692-00000082"/> which, like its antagonist, water,
                  makes the most splendid of vassals, but the most awful of masters.</p>
               <p>"I will never smoke another pipe while I live," exclaimed Mr. Bellamy, with
                  remorseful energy—and he never did; but after a while the blue smoke of his
                  fragrant Havanas curled gracefully round his head. A spark from a cigar might
                  kindle a conflagration, too; but it was not a <emph>pipe,</emph> and he had not
                  violated his oath.</p>
               <p>It may be said by some, that Hannibal's selection of the place where he bore his
                  rescued mistress, was the last the proverbially superstitious negro would have
                  chosen. But though Hannibal had all the superstitions of his race, in this
                  instance it was unaccompanied by fear. Had she been buried in some lone field,
                  where the wild-brier was suffered to trail, and the reptile to crawl, he might
                  have shunned it as haunted ground. But she slept so near his own cabin, where he
                  could see her quiet bed, whenever he went out into the field in the morning, or
                  returned to his evening rest. The hand of affection had made it so beautiful, and
                  his mistress had talked to him so sweetly of Cora in heaven, Cora happy in her
                  Saviour's pardoning love, and of the holy angels that guarded the place of her
                  repose, that Hannibal grew to love it, above every spot of earth, and to believe
                  he beheld with his actual glance those heavenly beings, keeping their nightly
                  guard, whom his mistress only saw with the inward eye of faith.</p>
               <p>When he had recovered the use of his arm, and commenced his labours, with even
                  more than his accustomed zeal, Mr. Bellamy renewed the offer which had been
                  rejected on the night of the fire.</p>
               <p>"Your mistress gave you your freedom, Hannibal," said his master, "and I too
                  repeated the gift with all my heart and soul. You refused to accept it then; but
                  you were excited, and had not had time to reflect on the value of what you
                  rejected. Once more I make you the same offer. I break your bonds. Hannibal, you
                  are henceforth and forever free."</p>
               <p>"And I must leave you, master?"</p>
               <p>"To remain among those who have been your fellow-slaves, would create discontent,
                  perhaps, and ill-will. Yes; but you could go back to your native country—that is,
                  the country of your fathers. I can send you to Liberia, where a colony of your own
                  colour is established, and where you may, perchance, be happier than you have ever
                  been with me."</p>
               <p>Hannibal spread both hands on the top of the shovel he was holding, and leaned his
                  chin over on the firm platform, with his large, thoughtful eyes fixed steadily on
                  the ground. He seemed to be revolving deeply the momentous question, so calmly and
                  deliberately presented to him. At length, raising his head and drawing a deep
                  inspiration, he said: "I been argufying the subject with myself, master, and I
                  comes to this conclusion—I rather stay with you and mistress, jist as I be, and
                  jist as you be, than go way off 'mong strange people, who know nothing and care
                  nothing 'bout me, no more than the man in the moon. I've sometimes thought, when I
                  been working and thinking, 'twould be mighty fine thing to be free, work jist when
                  I pleased, and long as I pleased, and make a heap of money all for my own self;
                  and if I'd had a hard master, as some niggers has, I'd a run off, and gone where
                  the free folks live. But you allos been kind, and mistress too. When I sick you
                  nuss me and pray for me. Doctor come and make me well. When I die, you bury me
                  long side of Cora, and mistress and miss Katy come and cry over poor Hannibal, and
                  say, 'Poor fellow—so sorry he done dead.' Way off yonder, they no care whether he
                  live or die. No, master, I stay and work with you, Lord willing, long as I
                  live."</p>
               <p>Hannibal held out his Herculean hand, and Mr. Bellamy grasped it warmly,
                  cordially, gratefully. He felt that he had a friend, a sincere, honest,
                  true-hearted friend, in the devoted African.</p>
               <p>"God bless you, Hannibal."</p>
               <p>"God bless you too, master."</p>
               <p>The general felt bound to his master ever after by a bond, stronger than that of
                  slavery—a bond that never could be loosened.</p>

               <p>BELLAMY Place rose from its ashes adorned with new beauty. It had lost, however,
                  some of its depth of shade, for several of its noble hickories had bowed beneath
                  the axe, after being scathed and blasted by the breath of the flame. The mansion
                  was not completed internally, but a sufficient number of rooms was finished to
                  furnish a pleasant and comfortable home for the lately exiled family.</p>
               <p>Man loves to build, and to enter in; he loves to plan, and to execute; to improve
                  on the labours of the past, to see in the forms of beauty and fitness growing out
                  under his directing hand, the refinement of his taste, and the progression of his
                  understanding. While the old mansion remained strong, comfortable, and handsome,
                  Mr. Bellamy had no plea for erecting a new one. But since necessity gave the
                  command, he had found excitement and delight in superintending a work in which the
                  classic taste of his friend Warland greatly assisted him. Another reflection added
                  to the satisfaction of Mr. Bellamy. He <emph>had</emph> experienced a domestic
                  misfortune; the hand of chastisement had been laid upon him, gently, it is true,
                  but he was no longer that strange anomaly—a man all sunshine. The cloud had come,
                  had passed; he felt as if he had a better right to the returning sunbeams. Ah,
                  what right has man to any earthly possessions? By what tenure does he retain the
                  gifts of God? <q>

               <p>There is an old adage, (and there is truth in these time-honoured sayings,) that
                  "misfortunes never come singly." And a great poet has said, that "woes tread on
                  the heels of each other." There does seem to be a gregarious principle in the
                  whole family of misfortune, and where one sad member has found admission, one by
                  one the pale sisterhood come gliding in.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Bellamy was in College, there was another young man, a southerner, and a
                  Georgian, too, who entered at the same time; and during the four years of his
                  college life, he was his classmate and friend. His name was Arnold. When the
                  graduated students separated on the threshold of manhood, they pledged mutual
                  faith and confidence, however widely their paths might be divided. Years passed,
                  and Mr. Bellamy knew not the fortune of his friend, till he suddenly came in his
                  neighbourhood,—that is, within twenty miles,—having purchased a plantation about
                  that distance from Hickory Hill. Mr. Bellamy rejoiced in having an opportunity of
                  renewing his youthful friendship, though he regretted to find that the world
                  seemed to have had a hardening influence on his former frank and convivial
                  companion. After a while, Arnold requested his friend to become his security for a
                  debt of some magnitude. Unhesitatingly was the signature given. When again a
                  similar request was made, he did not shrink from this act of confidence. Arnold
                  was considered a wealthy man, and an honourable man, and Mr. Bellamy was the most
                  generous and confiding of human beings. About a year before the burning of Bellamy
                  Place, Arnold once more called.</p>
               <p>"This is the last time, Bellamy," said he, "that I am going to tax your
                  friendship. I have an opportunity of making a splendid speculation, and it would
                  be madness to slight it. In a few years I shall double all my property. The
                  plantation and negroes I am now going to purchase belong to an estate contiguous
                  to my own. If I do not buy immediately I shall be forestalled. I would not ask any
                  one else to be my security; I know <emph>you</emph> consider it a compliment. I
                  wish you would return it, Bellamy."</p>
               <p>Mr. Bellamy had thus gradually become security for debts amounting to, at least, a
                  hundred thousand dollars. Still he had no misgivings. He could not distrust, the
                  world smiled on Arnold, and his splendid speculations all seemed to prosper.<pb
                     n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6692-00000084"/> Indeed, he had not the smallest doubt
                  but that the first debts had been paid. The manner in which he had solicited the
                  favour the last time, convinced him that his own mind was free from all pecuniary
                  anxiety, and that his asking him at all was a mere matter of form. He had seen him
                  once since the burning of his dwelling, and Arnold had expressed the most
                  unbounded sympathy and regret, and urged him to come and remain with them till
                  their house was completed. Mrs. Bellamy declined the invitation. She had never
                  liked Arnold. She seemed to have an intuitive perception of his character, but as
                  he was her husband's friend, his early college friend, she did not like to express
                  her want of confidence in his moral worth. She could give no reasons for the
                  conclusions to which she had arrived, but she <emph>felt</emph> it to be just.</p>
               <p>One morning, while King was brushing his master's coat, with his light and
                  practised hand, he entertained him, as he often did, with the news of the day.</p>
               <p>"Master, you 'member Mr. Arnold, that used to come here and laugh so much? They
                  say he gone off, and all his niggers. Nobody knows where."</p>
               <p>Mr. Bellamy started.</p>
               <p>"Ah! who told you so?"</p>
               <p>"One of Doctor Manning's coloured folks, here, last night, and told me all about
                  it. He says he owed his master, and he no quality folks, to run off without
                  paying."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw, King; don't repeat such nonsense. He may have gone a journey, but as for
                  running away, it is out of the question. Mr. Arnold—impossible; I never heard of
                  such a thing; impossible!"</p>
               <p>"It's sure enough true, master. Doctor Manning knows. He heard of it, and went
                  there to see. The house all shut up, and not a nigger to be seen, black or white,
                  about the lot. I thought you'd like to hear it, master," continued King,
                  flourishing his brush with fresh vigour. He felt the consequence of having
                  communicated intelligence, that certainly agitated his master.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy, who sat in a loose morning wrapper, braiding her hair, let it fall
                  upon her shoulders. She little knew how deeply interested she herself was in this
                  reported flight. She felt that vague satisfaction we are all conscious of having
                  experienced, when facts confirm our preconceived and apparently groundless
                  opinions.</p>
               <p>"I suspect it is true," said she. "I never did have any confidence in that man. I
                  am sorry, on your account, that he is gone, and in such a disgraceful manner; but
                  I did not think it would affect you so much. Why, you really look pale,
                  agitated."</p>
               <p>"King, saddle my bay horse," said his master. As soon as he had left the room, Mr.
                  Bellamy continued, "I have reason to look pale, Isabel. It may be that we are all
                  ruined. Heaven forbid, though, that you should suffer through any deed of mine."
                  Then he related to his wife all his transactions with Arnold, and his fears that a
                  man who could leave the country in that clandestine manner, would not hesitate to
                  involve his friends in ruin.</p>
               <p>"But it is only the last debt that I have any misgivings about," he added. "The
                  first I know are paid. I will go over and see Doctor Manning. I will investigate
                  the matter. We must find some clue to his new home."</p>
               <p>Mr. Bellamy mounted his bay horse, without waiting for breakfast, and rode away
                  with an anxious and troubled countenance. He returned at night, weary and
                  depressed. Arnold had indeed gone—had been gone nearly a week, as it was supposed,
                  though the time of his departure could not be ascertained; and he could obtain no
                  clue by which to follow his course. Doctor Manning, to whom he was deeply
                  indebted, and who heard accidentally of his sudden exodus, had been making earnest
                  enquiries, and all that he had learned was of the most unsatisfactory nature. Mr.
                  Arnold's plantation was isolated, being separated by a long sweep of pine forests
                  from his nearest neighbour. He had purchased the one next his own, when he last
                  complimented Mr. Bellamy by requesting him to stand sponsor to the deed. No
                  situation could be more<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6692-00000085"/> favourable for
                  a clandestine departure; and whether he had gone to the winding banks of the
                  Mississippi, or the gulf-washed shores of Texas, or any other of the luxuriant
                  regions where slavery could find a home, it was in vain to interrogate. Mr.
                  Bellamy soon ascertained the full extent of his responsibilities. Arnold had paid
                  none of the notes that bore his signature. The whole immense weight of debt rested
                  on him. In the existing circumstances he stood a ruined man. All he asked was
                  time—time till every measure that wisdom and prudence might suggest and energy
                  execute, had been taken to discover the retreat of his treacherous friend, (so
                  justly named after the arch-traitor of his country,) and throw back upon
                     <emph>him</emph> the responsibilities he had so dishonourably imposed on
                  another.</p>
               <p>He would have commenced an immediate pursuit, but while he was travelling in one
                  direction, Arnold might be winging his way in another, and thus the distance
                  between them be only increased. Mr. Warland was indefatigable in his exertions to
                  find the route of the fugitive, and was absent many days in his fruitless search.
                  He had written to his son a full statement of the pecuniary embarrassments of his
                  benefactor, and waited with anxiety his reply. It wanted only a few months of the
                  time marked out for the completion of his studies, and for his return to the sunny
                  South.</p>
               <p>The return of Marcus had been anticipated by the family as a kind of social
                  millennium. Mr. Bellamy's large and generous heart had been expanding and glowing
                  with the hopes associated with his adopted son. He would establish him in the
                  world, with all the munificence he would have done a son who bore his name, and
                  would perpetuate its honours. Thus relieved from every sordid care, his brilliant
                  talents should bear him, and light him up to the heights of fame, and he himself
                  would rest happy in the proud distinction of having assisted in the development of
                  his mind of beauty and strength, of having given it opportunity and sunshine, the
                  means to acquire, the power to enjoy, and the station to influence.
                     <emph>Now,</emph> what could he do for Marcus? With a sudden and crushing
                  weight of debt incumbent on him, which might involve the contingency of selling
                  his slaves, those sable children of his care, he could no longer indulge in the
                  luxury of benevolence.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Bellamy, timid and delicate woman that she was, the tender and indulged child
                  of prosperity, contemplated with more fortitude than her husband their darkened
                  prospects. She was more sanguine, more hopeful, more certain that every thing
                  "would work together for good" at last.</p>
               <p>" I am sure," she would say, in her sweet, assuring accents, "that we shall
                  discover where your false friend has hid himself. The creditors are all honourable
                  men, who will not oppress you. They will give you <emph>time,</emph> and that is
                  all you want. Two or three years of harvest as abundant as the last, will enable
                  you to pay the whole. We may have to economise, it is true; but household
                  discipline will do us good. Ah! but Marcus—you say. Well, Marcus is now prepared
                  to battle with the world. With his splendid natural endowments, and the education
                  you have given him, he has a capital to commence with, which the richest, proudest
                  youth in the land might envy. I have no fears for him. You wanted to give our
                  sweet Katy a handsome marriage portion! Katy is a fortune in herself; and he who
                  does not think so, is unworthy of her. Cheer up! my husband. We shall remain an
                  unbroken household yet; our sable families will not be scattered to the four winds
                  of heaven. Faithful, attached creatures! bitterly should I mourn if such should be
                  their ultimate destiny."</p>
               <p>As the air softly insinuates itself below a body heavier than itself, and buoys it
                  up above the earth to which it is sinking, so this gentle comforter sustained the
                  spirit of her husband, and counteracted the gravitating influence of anxiety and
                  care.</p>
               <p>Beautifully has one of the sweetest poets that ever sang, described the influence
                  of adversity on the human heart. It is indeed only in the night-time of our being
                  that the stars of Love, and Hope, and Faith come out with their divine radiance,
                  setting a crown of glory on its darkness. It is only the<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000086"/> wounded heart that yields the richest fragrance of
                  affection. It is only the bruised spirit that exhales celestial balm. The buds of
                  the odoriferous Calæanthus are scentless as the acorn, till crushed by the hand
                  that plucks them. Mr. Bellamy thought of these things, and was comforted. The
                  fidelity and self-devotion of Hannibal were displayed on the fiery background of
                  his burning dwelling—splendid relief for a glorious picture! The sweet
                  disinterestedness and resignation of his wife shone forth on the cloud that
                  treachery had rolled above him. The gratitude and heroism of the son of his
                  adoption would yet be written in gilded characters on the same gray tablet.</p>
               <p>Nearly two years from the night that Marcus and Delaval parted from Florence, in
                  the little red-curtained library, they approached, about the same hour, the
                  beautiful suburbs of Wood Lawn. They entered the gate, rode round the
                  semi-circular gravel road that led to the house, guided by the bright light that
                  streamed like a beacon through the scarlet drapery of the window. The heart of
                  Marcus throbbed audibly in his bosom. Delaval uttered an exclamation of delight.
                  Just as the carriage stopped, a girlish figure intercepted the rays of that
                  beacon-lamp, the folds of the curtains were gathered hastily back, a radiant face
                  flashed for a moment, like the evening star, on their vision—then disappeared.</p>
               <p>In an instant the door was opened. The music of light footsteps was heard. The
                  star-beams of bright eyes were seen; and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >Florence—L'éclair,</foreign> as she was simultaneously called by the two
                  friends, was in the arms of both. In that moment of joy, so intense as to be
                  allied to anguish, Marcus remembered his own daring lines— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>Be mine the lightning's arrowy gleam,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Though death be working in its dart,</l>
                        <l>I'd bask beneath the scorching beam,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">And bind it burning to my heart.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>He felt the realization of his prayer. He had indeed climbed the mountain steeps
                  of fame, he <emph>clasped in his arms the electric flame,</emph> and knew
                     <emph>that its radiant glories</emph> might one day be his. Florence, who with
                  the wild impulse of joy had flown to meet the travellers, thought not that others
                  might also hear the coming wheels, and hasten to greet them. She had forgotten the
                  existence of her stately aristocratic uncle; of the mild but prosaic Mrs. Lewis.
                  Thought, feeling, memory, were for the moment all fused in the lightning, whose
                  incarnation she was.</p>
               <p>Very cold, and stately, and formal was the greeting Mr. Alston awarded to Marcus.
                  The threatened insolvency of Mr. Bellamy had reached the inmates of Wood Lawn, and
                  his adopted son no longer found favour as such in the eyes of one who was so
                  exceedingly careful to have <emph>irreproachable</emph> companions for his nephew
                  and niece. He had witnessed with overwhelming astonishment and sovereign
                  displeasure the meeting between him and Florence, and determined that very night
                  to exercise his authority as a guardian, and forbid all farther intimacy, or even
                  intercourse. The co-heiress of Wood Lawn should be taught more aspiring views, and
                  the young Adonis placed on his true level. But all the ice-bergs of the polar seas
                  could not chill the glowing heart of Marcus. He scarcely saw the stiff,
                  perpendicular form that stood with glacial mien on the threshold; he was conscious
                  of but one thing, the presence, the love of L'éclair, for thus his spirit baptised
                  her. She stood now beneath the light of the chandelier, both hands clasped in
                  those of her brother, her eyes upturned to his face, and flashing back the rays
                  that illumined them.</p>
               <p>"Why, Florence, what a magnificent girl you are," exclaimed Delaval, releasing one
                  hand from her loving clasp, and pushing back the wild flowing ringlets from her
                  brow. "I begin to think there can be such a thing as a handsome brunette. Warland,
                  did you ever see any one so wonderfully beautiful in two years?"</p>
               <p>"Oh! don't ask him," she cried, placing her hand, laughingly, on her brother's
                  lips, to imprison the flattering words. "He never was guilty of a compliment,
                  never—and least of all to me. Don't take away his sublime truthfulness. It is his
                  greatest charm."</p>

                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000087"/> simple truth you admire so much," answered Marcus.
                  "You are right in saying that you are the last person I should think of
                  complimenting."</p>
               <p>The words were not much, but the manner in which they were uttered gave them
                  volumes of meaning. The bloom of the carnation glowed through the soft olive of
                  her cheeks. They certainly presented a beautiful contrast as they stood side by
                  side in the brilliant light that sparkled from above on the bright mirror of their
                  faces, and which each reflected back to the other; she representing the warmth and
                  resplendence of her own sunny South—he, the purity and vitality of the northern
                  clime, whose breezes had given a tone of manliness to his face and form, wanting
                  in the person of the youthful graduate. His hair, too, those glorious locks,
                  seemed to have caught a shadow from the mountains, 'neath whose brow he had been
                  so long resting, that softened while it deepened their golden splendour.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston, who had been absent a few moments, was struck on his re-entrance by
                  the proximity of these two radiant figures, and the increasing danger of this
                  juxtaposition.</p>
               <p>"Florence," said he, in his cold, measured tone, with that insufferable wave of
                  the hand he deemed so majestic and awe-inspiring, "you had better go and see if
                  the supper is in a due state of preparation for these two young gentlemen. They
                  have travelled far, and must by this time feel, in an uncomfortable manner, the
                  cravings of hunger."</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Lewis is attending to that, uncle—you know she is," answered Florence
                  carelessly. "Sorry indeed should I be for the appetite of these young gentlemen,
                  if they had no better dependance than me to supply their wants. Nor do I believe
                  they are so very hungry yet. For myself, I am too happy to eat for a week to
                  come."</p>
               <p>"Miss Delaval," said her uncle, with deepening gravity, "will you favour me with
                  your company in the library, while your brother and Mr. Warland partake of their
                  supper, over which Mrs. Lewis will preside with due attention."</p>
               <p>"Who is Miss Delaval?" cried Florence, shrinking with unconcealed repugnance from
                  the proposed tête-à-tête. "There is no Miss Delaval here, I am sure, to her uncle,
                  her brother, or her friend."</p>
               <p>"Miss Florence Delaval knows very well whom I mean, and what I mean. If she does
                  not see fit to give me her company in the library or any private apartment, she
                  will force me to say in this presence what I shall be sorry to address to a niece
                  of mine."</p>
               <p>"You had better go, sister," said Delaval, "and entertain uncle, while Warland and
                  myself dispatch our suppers. As you have both supped, we do not care about having
                  you stare at us while we are swallowing our coffee and bread and butter. People
                  never look interesting when they are eating, especially when they are hungry, and
                  are apt to take rather large mouthfuls."</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Alston, Miss Delaval will attend you to the library," cried Florence,
                  with a countenance of such assumed solemnity that Delaval laughed outright; but
                  Marcus bit his indignant lip, well divining the cause of the required interview,
                  and scarcely able to restrain the impulse that urged him "to beard the Douglas in
                  his hall," and assert his own native lordliness. The young men were summoned to
                  supper. Florence led the way to the library.</p>
               <p>Her uncle waved his hand towards a chair. She silently waved hers towards another,
                  with a motion exactly resembling his own. The dignified gentleman was
                  disconcerted.</p>
               <p>"Niece!"</p>
               <p>"Uncle!"</p>
               <p>"I hope you do not presume to make sport of the justly offended feelings of your
                  guardian and delegated parent. I ought not, however, to be surprised at any thing
                  in a young lady who has made the exhibition I have witnessed to-night."</p>
               <p>Florence seated herself deliberately in a chair, and folded her arms over her
                  breast.</p>
               <p>"Now, sir," said she, fixing her eyes steadfastly upon him,<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000088"/> "I am ready to listen with becoming gravity to the
                  charges you are about to bring against me; ready to hear what you would be sorry
                  to address to a niece of yours in the presence of others; ready to learn what
                  exhibition you have witnessed that has prepared you for such surprising
                  results."</p>
               <p>"In the first place, Miss Florence Delaval, your reception of this young man was
                  the most unpardonable thing I ever beheld. That the heiress of Wood Lawn, a young
                  lady of such expectations and responsibilities, should so entirely forget the
                  dignity of her station, her pride of ancestry, her great wealth and high
                  character, and descend to the permission of such unwarrantable familiarity, I
                  never would have believed, if ocular demonstration had not forced upon me the
                  conviction of the disgraceful fact."</p>
               <p>"Disgraceful!" exclaimed Florence, starting up, the <emph>wounded crimson</emph>
                  rushing in torrents to her face and neck, and her haughty eyes emitting sparkles
                  of fire. "How dare you thus insult me, sir? From my own father, were he living, I
                  would not bear it.
                     Disgraceful—unpardonable—unwarrantable—<emph>disgraceful!</emph> I tell you,
                  sir, I glory in feeling all you consider my shame and dishonour."</p>
               <p>"Is it possible? Is it possible?" repeated Mr. Alston, "that you have so little
                  self-respect, so little regard for the opinion of the world. But if
                     <emph>you</emph> have suffered yourself to be infatuated by the mere beauty of
                  one so immeasurably your inferior in rank; if your <emph>brother</emph> blindly
                  permits what it is his duty strenuously to guard against, <emph>I</emph> shall
                  certainly exert my authority to the utmost, and forbid this young man all farther
                  intercourse with one who, I am sorry to say, seems utterly unconscious what is due
                  to herself or her friends."</p>
               <p>"I defy your authority, sir, since you thus abuse it," she cried. "All the respect
                  due to my mother's brother I have ever paid you. For the care you have taken of my
                  interests and property I have been duly grateful, but you never had, and never
                  will have, any authority over my affections. If you knew me a little better, you
                  would discover that the very attempt to restrain them only gives them greater
                  strength and power. Marcus Warland my inferior—your inferior—any man's inferior! I
                  should like to have you to prove it, sir. The time will come, when he will soar so
                  high above you, even in rank, that you will feel honoured by his slightest notice.
                  Beauty!" repeated she, with a smile of disdain. "I hope I am above being
                  infatuated by mere beauty; but the strong will, the lofty spirit, the generous
                  heart, these are fascinations whose power I am not ashamed to own, whose power has
                  made me what I am."</p>
               <p>"You are a very self-willed and unmanageable young lady; that is what you
                  are."</p>
               <p>"Well, uncle, I am just of age now—George is of age; you are not obliged to
                  trouble yourself any longer with the management of my rebellious will; you seem to
                  have forgotten this circumstance."</p>
               <p>"I did not expect such an ungrateful return for all my care," said Mr. Alston,
                  walking with stately steps the length of the library, then turning to retrace
                  them, "I thought I had inspired some little affection, some faint respect, but I
                  see I have been mistaken. Long years of watchfulness and anxiety are forgotten, as
                  though they had never been."</p>
               <p>"No, no, dear uncle, they are not forgotten," exclaimed Florence, springing
                  forward and seizing his unwilling hand in both her own; "I may be wilful and
                  unmanageable, but not ungrateful; oh, no. You <emph>have</emph> been very kind to
                  two orphan children, indeed you have. I would not be disrespectful, or independent
                  of your authority; but when you say such terrible things, as you have to-night,
                  you turn my blood to flame, and I know not what I say. I really feel as if there
                  were a deep scar here," added she, putting her hand to her forehead, "a blistering
                  one. But let us understand each other fully; for I would not, willingly, pass
                  through another scene like this. That you may not believe that I have been
                  actuated to-night by a bold and unmaidenly impulse, I will show you proofs of a
                  long and heart-felt communion." Opening a rosewood cabinet<pb n="178-179"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000089"/> net, she took out a packet of letters, tied with a
                  blue ribbon, and continued,—"These letters, dear uncle, I have received from
                  Marcus Warland, under cover of my brother's, while he has been resident in a
                  northern clime. These letters I have answered under the same fraternal authority.
                  For two years our minds, hearts and souls have been holding the closest, the most
                  sacred communion. For two years I have been feeding on the heavenly wisdom of his
                  written words, and growing in mental grace and purity. Oh! these letters," she
                  exclaimed, with a kindling countenance, apparently forgetting whom she was
                  addressing, and pressing them with an impassioned gesture against her heart, "how
                  they have exalted and purified my inmost being! They are the transcript of an
                  angelic nature; the breathings of an immortal spirit. Can you blame me, because my
                  soul bounded to meet the soul that had been transposed, as it were, into my own?
                  That my heart sought the heart that governed and ruled my own, even when mountains
                  heaved and rivers rolled between us?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston gazed upon the spirited, passionate beauty of his niece with feelings
                  kindred to awe. There is a sublimity in passion, which even the coldest natures
                  are constrained to acknowledge. He felt himself baffled, resisted. He had expected
                  to intimidate, by an unwonted exercise of power. He was himself controlled by an
                  influence he could not understand. Once before, he had bowed before this young
                  girl's will, when he would have compelled her to accept the addresses of Pellam,
                  for whom she cherished the most sovereign scorn. Like Acre's valour, he felt his
                  authority <emph>oozing</emph> gradually away, having effected nothing but a few
                  blustering and pompous speeches. Florence saw and triumphed in her power, but she
                  was too generous to do it openly.</p>
               <p>"Am I released, uncle?" asked she, with a sweet, exacting smile. "It is so long
                  since I have seen George."</p>
               <p>"I see it is useless to detain you," he answered. "I have fulfilled my duty
                  conscientiously and irreproachably. If you are indeed beyond my authority, and
                  reject my counsels, you must abide by the consequences, whatever they may be. But
                  be assured of one thing, niece, I never will give my consent to an ill-assorted
                     marriage,—<emph>never.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"It never shall be asked, uncle, be assured by me," cried she;
                     "<emph>never.</emph> And now, if you are tired of my company, I will not detain
                  you, for, if you please, I would rather remain here for the present."</p>
               <p>Seating herself on the window-seat, she veiled her face with the curtain, while
                  her uncle walked into the parlour with slow and creaking steps. Marcus and Delaval
                  were walking in the piazza, impatient for the termination of the conference. The
                  library window opened into the piazza, and the moment they saw the dark ringlets
                  twisted with the scarlet folds, they eagerly approached. There was a bench outside
                  of the window, on which they seated themselves, while Florence sat within, the
                  lamp-light behind her, the starry heavens before her, with certain living stars
                  mingling their beams with those that glittered in the sky.</p>
               <p>"So you liked the north," said she, addressing both. "You became naturalized,
                  acclimated, domesticated there. You have returned, I know, with divided hearts.
                  How many times have I been wishing for a pair of fairy wings to bear me to the top
                  of those empurpled mountains, to the banks of that magnificent river, and more
                  than all, to the charming home of that dear, delightful Judge Cleveland. Did you
                  tell him you had a sister, who had fallen irretrievably, inextricably in love with
                  him from a two-fold description? I think you said Mrs. Cleveland was a frail,
                  delicate woman."</p>
               <p>"Most inveterately healthy and invariably charming, and intensely devoted to her
                  excellent husband," answered Delaval. "The North is a glorious country. I honour
                  its institutions, I respect its inhabitants, and love even its snows and icicles;
                  but better do I love the soft and dewy South. I would not exchange its balmy
                  blossoms for the diamond icicles of the North, nor its genial gales for the
                  Hyperborean blasts."</p>
               <pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC6692-00000090"/>
               <p>"You had some strong prejudices to encounter," said Florence. "I hope you always
                  wielded victorious weapons."</p>
               <p>"Here stands the champion of the South," said Delaval, laying his hand on the
                  shoulder of Marcus. "I wonder his laurels do not smother him. The clouds of
                  prejudice have rolled away before the sun-bursts of his eloquence, as the mists of
                  the valley before the rising day."</p>
               <p>"Do not make a noble cause ridiculous by exaggeration," cried Marcus, "or give me
                  all the laurels, which should, by right, be divided between us. I think we have
                  both done much towards dissipating erroneous opinions, cherished toward our
                  southern institutions. It is astonishing how little is really known of our
                  domestic manners and relations, when so many northerners live and dwell among us;
                  and it is surprising, too, that while the sons and daughters of the North are
                  scattered all over our genial soil, deriving wealth and happiness from its fertile
                  bosom, so few children of the South plant themselves on the granite hills of New
                  England. They go, as we have done, to drink of the thousand streams of knowledge
                  that flow from their fountain-heads of science and literature; but having quenched
                  their thirst and invigorated their spirits, they return once more to the
                  well-springs of the heart that gush forth to meet them, in their own fair sunny
                  land."</p>
               <p>While Marcus was speaking, Delaval had risen and sauntered down the gravel walk,
                  picking up the white pebbles that glimmered in the star-light, and throwing them
                  across the dewy grass. One would have supposed, from his careless motions, that he
                  scarcely knew of what he was thinking; but he was well aware of the subject of his
                  thoughts. If he looked up to the deep blue of the night-arch, it reminded him of
                  the sapphire eyes of Katy; if he noticed the boughs of the Acacia swaying in the
                  breeze, it recalled her graceful figure floating on the music of the dance. The
                  roseate daughters of the North, charming as they were, had not won his allegiance
                  from the blue-eyed maiden, with the magnolia cheek and the willowy eye-lash.</p>
               <p>In the mean time Marcus and Florence continued their conversation, by the shadow
                  of the curtain, and it seemed to deepen in interest, for he lowered his voice and
                  bowed his head, till his bright locks mingled with her jetty ringlets, and his
                  breath lingered on the roses of her cheek. He told her of his plans for the
                  future, his hopes and expectations. He spoke not of fears—he knew them not. He was
                  resolved to give no rest to body or mind, till he had discovered the man who had
                  defrauded his benefactor, and forced him to liquidate the debts, whose burden he
                  had imposed upon another. This was a holy duty—a duty of gratitude, he had bound
                  himself by a vow to perform. He had no doubt of success.</p>
               <p>"I <emph>can</emph> find him—I <emph>will</emph>—if God spare my life," he added;
                  "and then I shall seek for that spot, on this broad, green earth, the Creator has
                  marked out as the vineyard of my soul. When the vintage is ripe, and I have
                  trodden, a little time, the wine-press in my own strength, I will build a bower
                  for my beloved, where I can rest with her, when weary of the heat and burden of
                  the day. It must be a beautiful bower, covered with flowering vines and wreathing
                  foliage, sheltered bravely from sun and wind, before I can ask her to share it
                  with me."</p>
               <p>"Supposing she has already a bower of her own, all covered with blossoms and
                  bonny-spreading shrubs," answered Florence, blushing at her own ingenuousness;
                  "why not let it furnish a shelter for you, from the winds and storms of life,
                  instead of roaming for a fairer spot, which perchance you might never find?"</p>
               <p>"No, Florence—noble, frank-hearted girl that you are. No, L'éclair. Knowing myself
                  to be as high above all mercenary motives as the heavens are above the earth, and
                  believing in my power to win your affections and secure your happiness, I have
                  loved and wooed you—you, a wealthy heiress—and I, with naught but what nature and
                  education have bestowed. So certain am I of being able to offer you independence
                  and an honourable name, if life and health remain,<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000091"/> that I have not the selfishness to wish you poor
                  that I may prove my disinterestedness and my love. The time will come, when even
                  your haughty uncle will deem it no derogation of his dignity to seek the hand now
                  clasping your own."</p>
               <p>"I believe it—I know it, Marcus," said Florence. "It is this full, glad
                  consciousness of your own powers that triumphed over my despotic will. Were you
                  timid and distrustful, I should still be the haughty, capricious damsel, who
                  sprinkled your fair locks at the brink of the fountain."</p>
               <p>The mild aspect of the summer-night tempted them abroad, and they followed Delaval
                  down the gravel walk. Two beautiful trees clasped their green hands over the gate,
                  and seemed to toss up the young moon, that hung in argent beauty just between
                  them. The songs of the negroes were wafted to their ears, mingling with the soft,
                  dreamy buzz of the insect world in the air. It is not strange, as Marcus was to
                  leave by morning light, that they lingered till the silver crescent was seen high
                  up, in the darkening dome of midnight.</p>
               <p>The next morning Florence found the following lines, in one of the folds of the
                  crimson curtain. They might have been blown there, by the breeze of night, for she
                  had forgotten to close the window of the library: <q>

               <p>MARCUS arrived at Hickory Hill, and all the shadows that had been gathering over
                  it seemed to flee before the sunshine of his presence. To the black as well as the
                  white, it was a jubilee of the heart, for Marcus was a favourite of all, and
                  Milly, as she looked upon him with the signet of manhood on his brow, felt as if
                  the ancient honours of their house were all restored in him. She was elated too by
                  the prospects of her young mistress, for Katy, in the simplicity of her young and
                  loving nature, had not been able to conceal from this faithful friend the secret
                  of her heart. When she had read to her passages from her brother's letters,
                  Milly's cunning eye could always detect another letter partially concealed in the
                  throbbing bosom, whose pulsations it hurried, and she overheard Marcus telling his
                  sister that <emph>he</emph> was coming very soon. "Yes, sweet Katy," said he, "he
                  bid me say, that before the bud of the rose should open and fade, he would be
                  where his heart already is."</p>
               <p>"And now," muttered Milly to herself, while she busied herself with the work,
                  "Miss Katy will soon ride in her carriage, just as mistress used to do 'fore ole
                  master drank up all his money and 'sessions. Young master, that Miss Katy loves,
                  got a heap of property, I knows, and Milly will live with her young mistress, and
                  wait on her, and nuss her childer may-be, as she did her, for childer are like
                  olive plants, all polished in the corner, as good ole Simon used to say."</p>
               <p>But Katy thought not of fine carriages or fine houses. She thought only of the
                  generous heart given in exchange for her own. She was happy in the consciousness
                  of being beloved and of loving. Were Delaval poor, with nothing but a log cabin to
                  offer her, she would have felt equally happy, perhaps<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000092"/> more so, for in her lowly self-estimate gratitude
                  was as strong as her love. Far different was she from Marcus. The contrast in
                  their characters was visible in their countenances. While her glance, in soft
                  humility, usually sought the ground, his, with eagle ambition, was naturally
                  lifted towards the sun. <emph>He</emph> felt no gratitude to Florence, because she
                  being an heiress loved him for himself alone. His love enriched her, as well as
                  hers him. It was not the heiress he loved, but the being, all heart and soul; and
                  the mere accident of her wealth weighed nothing in the estimation of her worth.
                  Were he master of millions, he would not be elevated in his own opinion; were he
                  utterly destitute, he would not be degraded. When a boy, he had learned to
                  separate himself from outward conditions; to look upon himself as a God-endowed,
                  though man-neglected child. He had felt more proud of his heaven-born riches, when
                  he wove his osier baskets, by the blaze of a light-wood knot, than when the oaken
                  garland was cast at his feet mid the thundering plaudits of an admiring
                  audience.</p>
               <p>With the promptitude and energy that marked his character, he resolved to take
                  immediate measures for the discovery and apprehension of the traitorous and
                  fugitive Arnold. He saw the cloud of anxiety on the usually serene brow of Mr.
                  Bellamy, and he rejoiced to think that he might be the instrument to disperse it.
                  Wait! No, that was impossible. He was no longer a boy to care for holiday
                  pleasures. He was a man, ready to fulfil manhood's loftiest duties. And then he
                  had his own vineyard to cultivate, his bower to build; not in the valley, but on
                  the table-land of the mountain top, in the full warmth and splendour of an
                  equatorial latitude. He had marked out his work, and he had not only the mind to
                  conceive, but the spirit to sustain, the heart to encourage, and the hand to
                  execute.</p>
               <p>With indefatigable zeal he collected all the documents necessary to invest him as
                  agent plenipotentiary for his benefactor. He visited the most distinguished
                  lawyers, obtained the most powerful judicial advice, and made himself master of
                  the subject in all its bearings and relations. He had a certainty that Arnold had
                  directed his course to Texas, then the lone star in the national firmament,
                  towards which the eyes of outlaws and criminals were turned as the orb of hope and
                  promise. He had heard of several farmers who had sold their plantations, believing
                  they had exhausted the riches of the soil, and removed to the luxuriant, and as
                  yet uncultivated lands fertilized by the waters of the Colorado. To Texas he
                  determined to bend his course, and when every thing was prepared, one fine,
                  bright, inspiring morning, mounted on a spirited horse, with a green blanket and
                  well-filled valise strapped on behind him, and an ample supply of money about his
                  person, he commenced his expedition. The ferryman's cabin lay right in his path,
                  and Marcus was not sorry to visit once more the scene of the stern discipline of
                  his boyhood.</p>
               <p>Once more the sweet murmuring voice of the Long Moss Spring welcomed him to its
                  margin. Once more the splendid-leaved magnolia swept its boughs over his head,
                  while its magnificent blossoms unfolded their waxen bosoms to the air, and
                  perfumed it with their intense odours. The feathery moss still curled over the bed
                  of the fountain, green in the sunshine, blue in the shade; and pure and white
                  gleamed the rocks through the clear, gurgling waters. As Marcus gazed around with
                  that fullness of heart this scene ever caused, he beheld, not far from the spot
                  where he stood, a mound, covered with grassy turf, of that peculiar oblong form
                  which indicates the last resting-place of man. He remembered his friend, the aged
                  Simon, whom two years before he had seen bowed over the fountain's edge, and he
                  was sure he was slumbering in that quiet bed. While he stood with pensive brow and
                  folded arms, looking down on the green sward, the ferryman's wife, the same woman
                  who had lent him the blanket, and assisted in ferrying the boat over the
                  moon-lighted waves, approached the fountain, with a wooden bucket, poised in the
                  African style, on her uncovered head. She started at the sudden apparition, but
                  soon recognised the handsome youth, who had seemed so<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000093"/> like an angel to her, slumbering in the moonbeams.
                  After having greeted her with his wonted courtesy, he questioned her about his old
                  African friend, and learned that he indeed slept his last sleep near the murmurs
                  of the fountain, whose music had so often soothed his aged ears. He was found dead
                  by the side of the spring, with his face turned towards the waving moss, as if his
                  soul went floating down the silver current into the neighbouring river, and thence
                  into the great ocean of eternity. It had been his reiterated request to be
                  interred near that spot, and the scene of his death became the place of his
                  burial.</p>
               <p>"I didn't mind it at first," said the woman, "for I didn't know how lonely it
                  would make the place seem. But now, when I come down at night for water, I dare
                  not look on that grave, and yet I see it all the time. I hurry back as fast as I
                  can, and then I hear old Simon hobbling behind me all the way."</p>
               <p>"Poor old Simon!" exclaimed Marcus, with glistening eyes. "You need have no fears
                  of him. He was a true-hearted Christian, with a soul as white as that snowy basin.
                  As sure as there is a heaven, where suffering man finds rest, he has found
                  admittance there. He is no restless ghost to inspire terror in those he has left
                  behind."</p>
               <p>"Some time before he died," said the ferryman's wife, "he gave me a little packet,
                  wrapped in buckskin, sewed up tightly all round, which he wanted me to give to
                  you, whenever you came this way, for a woman named Milly. I'm glad you've come,
                  for I kind of hated to keep it. Dead folks property is a mighty sacred thing; when
                  it is fastened up so close, too, it seems more particular."</p>
               <p>While she went to the cabin to get the mysterious packet, Marcus indulged his
                  sincere and heartfelt sorrow over the grave of this devoted friend of his desolate
                  years. How short a time it seemed since he, a mere boy, sat at his side, watching
                  him peel the bark from the smooth willows with his wrinkled hands, while he
                  dropped luminous texts of scripture into the listening ears of Milly, or sang with
                  growing enthusiasm, "The old ship of Zion, glory, hallelujah."</p>
               <p>There was a smooth white stone lying close to the grave, such as formed the basis
                  of the fountain. Marcus knelt down, and taking his penknife, carved the name of
                  the old soldier on its yielding surface; then placing it at the head of the grave,
                  he pressed the earth against it, to prevent it from falling. He felt an
                  irresistible desire to consecrate the spot by some act of memory, some token of
                  human friendship. The ferryman's wife returned while he was engaged in this
                  touching rite of remembrance to the lowly negro, and she thought that she should
                  never again fear to approach it, even in the darkness of midnight. In silence she
                  placed the packet in his hand, then, when he turned away, she said,—</p>
               <p>"There is a wild rose-bush yonder; if you like, I will plant it by that stone, and
                  I will see that it does not fall. If the moss should grow over it, I will clear it
                  away from the name you have cut."</p>
               <p>"God bless you," exclaimed Marcus; "you have a feeling heart; I honour you for it.
                  Yes," added he, to himself, as he led his horse toward the ferry-boat, which had
                  just reached the shore, "this woman has native refinement and sensibility. I am
                  glad she dwells near my beloved spring. There is something in its placid, silvery
                  beauty, in its deep continuous music, that creates responsive beauty in the heart
                  that is bathed in it. I never approach it without feeling my immortality, my
                  eternity. My father's soul, after going through a baptism of fire, here found the
                  river of life. Poor old Simon, no doubt, here held communion with the Great
                  Invisible, whose image he beheld in the far depths of the waters. Beautiful
                  fountain of my boyhood!" continued he, casting one more backward glance, as he
                  stood on the brink of the river. "My being seems coeval with thine; I listen to
                  thy murmurs, and feel as if I had forever heard them sighing, breathing, mingling
                  with my soul; I watch thee swelling, flowing onward, onward—never wearying, never
                  pausing; full, exhaustless, deep, and<pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC6692-00000094"/>
                  clear; and I feel as if thus my existence had ever been flowing onward, onward,
                  and ever would flow, as long as God's eternal days shall last. Oh! when I have
                  realized the lofty dreams of my ambition,—when my spirit has wrestled, and
                  battled, and triumphed in the conflict with the stormy elements of the world, let
                  me come and bathe my thirsty lips in thy sweet tranquillizing wave; and when, like
                  the time-worn African, I lay my head on the clay-cold bosom of our general mother,
                  may thy lone, mysterious accents breathe forth my requiem, and thy silver gushings
                  beautify the place of my repose."</p>
               <p>Lost in his meditations, he had not observed that the ferryman's wife was
                  assisting her husband in urging the boat across the river. But the moment he
                  became aware of this circumstance, he grasped the pole, though she laughingly
                  endeavoured to retain it.</p>
               <p>"And thou, rejoicing river!" thought he, bending over and watching the resisting
                  waters gurgling and foaming round the opposing staff, "thou, too, seemest a part
                  of my own existence. Strong and glad and triumphant like thee, I go on my course,
                  receiving tributary streams of strength from all things around me and about me.
                  The breeze that rimples thy surface moves over and refreshes the stream of my
                  thoughts, and the sunbeams that flash on thy ripples play and sparkle over my
                  spirit's restless waves. We are one, O rejoicing river; we ever have been, and
                  ever shall be one."</p>
               <p>When he had landed, shaken hands with the woman, whose promise about the rose-bush
                  had raised her so much in the scale of being, and ascended the steep bank, he felt
                  as if he were at the starting point of his journey. He girded himself anew for the
                  enterprise, watching, with Indian sagacity, every thing that could indicate the
                  route of the fugitives. He had made inquiries of the ferryman, but they had
                  elicited no information.</p>
               <p>The weather was mild and clear, and as he swept along through the pine woods,
                  inhaling their healthy and inspiring odour, catching glimpses of the effulgent
                  blue of the heavens through the green dome above, and here and there the sparkling
                  of bright waters by the wayside, and the flow of the runnel across his path, he
                  felt the joy of a young traveller, and thought himself incapable of fatigue. But
                  when after several days continuous riding, without having met any adventure, or
                  any clue by which he could direct his course, his buoyant spirits began to lose a
                  little of their elasticity. It was probably owing to the electricity gathering in
                  the clouds that rolled round the setting sun, and deepened the gloom of the
                  twilight hour. Many who, like Marcus, have their beings charged with the electric
                  fluid, feel, on the approach of a thunderstorm, as if it were withdrawn from
                  themselves to give power and destructiveness to the elements, an oppression, an
                  attraction toward the earth painful and irresistible. Marcus was wont to associate
                  the idea of Florence with the lightning's flash, and he always hailed its
                  coruscations with rapture,—but, as she herself had told him, it was rather the
                  lambent glory that sports silently on the horizon's edge, than the blaze that
                  heralds' the thunder's crash, that was the emblem of the electric L'éclair. Deep
                  into the night he rode through the gathering storm, for the place to which he had
                  been directed for shelter was still far ahead, and he began to think he had turned
                  into the wrong road. At length his horse, dazzled and scared by the lightning,
                  stopped short, and refused to proceed. He perceived, at the same time, a hut, a
                  little removed from the wayside, which he thought might furnish shelter for the
                  night. He could see a gleam of light through the wooden shutters, and concluded
                  that it was inhabited; so, obeying the instincts of the horse rather than his own,
                  he dismounted, and led the animal toward the hovel, guided by the lightning's
                  flash. Fastening his horse under the stoup that projected toward the road, he
                  opened the door and looked round the dark, unfurnished apartment, that was
                  partially illumined by a flickering blaze in the chimney. A frame, which was
                  probably erected for a bedstead, stood on one side; a pile of old planks was
                  placed diagonally<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6692-00000095"/> nally resting against
                  the front and one end of the building, and all the shadows gathered in the vacuum
                  behind this rude rampart. Marcus gazed with surprise on the fire burning on the
                  lone hearth, the only sign of inhabitancy in the desolate place. Perhaps some
                  traveller had paused and lighted that blaze to cook a hasty meal, hurrying away
                  from the storm that had so long seemed muttering behind. This idea was confirmed
                  by a crust of bread and morsel of sweet potato lying on the hearth. Marcus threw
                  another knot on the blaze, and spreading his blanket on the boards, while his
                  valise served him as a pillow, he soon slept the sound sleep of the youthful
                  traveller, though the rain drifted in torrents against the roof, and the thunders
                  shook the timbers, and rattled the dust from the rafters.</p>
               <p>"Ha!" exclaimed the sleeper, suddenly wakened by the falling of his head against
                  the boards. "Ha!" springing up on his feet and making the old planks ring by the
                  rebound. The pine-knot still sparkled with an intermitting light, and he could
                  see, for his vision was clear, a black spectre leaping toward the door with his
                  valise in his hand. While it was fumbling for the latch, Marcus, darting after it,
                  imprisoned its arms with a grasp that made it cry out lustily for mercy."</p>
               <p>"Oh! master—Lord a mercy—mercy! Please let go. I jist went to see what you had for
                  pillow," cried the negro, his teeth chattering with terror, for Marcus had the
                  strength of a young lion, and his gripe was like steel on his muscles.</p>
               <p>"You were taking it out of doors to look at it, were you?" said Marcus, smiling at
                  the terrified countenance of the negro, on which the fitful blaze made fantastic
                  lights and shadows. "Come this way, and let me see what you are."</p>
               <p>Dragging him, unresisting, toward the hearth, he perused the coal-black face, in
                  which the eyes were revolving with inconceivable rapidity. There was a long, deep
                  scar on the right side of the forehead, which gave a peculiar expression to the
                  orb beneath. There was something in the face, the scar, the facial angle, that
                  gave him a vague and troubled feeling of remembrance.</p>
               <p>"Hector!" involuntarily fell from his lips—"Laughing Hector."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that be me," said the trembling negro. "Oh! Lord, how you know my name,
                  master?"</p>
               <p>"Did you ever have a master by the name of Warland?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, master, that I did. Good master, too; but he fell a drinking; then he sell
                  his coloured people. You know him, master?"</p>
               <p>"Hector, would you rob your own master's son? Would you rob the son of your
                  mistress, now laid in the grave?"</p>
               <p>"Little master Marcus!" exclaimed the African, his sable features lighted with a
                  gleam of recognition. "You don't say so. Grown so fine and strong, too," rubbing
                  his aching arm. "Oh! young master, pray forgib Hector; he no know it be you. He
                  jist wanted to look—to see—a"——</p>
               <p>"Never mind, Hector. I hope you will have more respect for the next traveller you
                  chance to meet, or you may fare worse than you do now. I am sorry to see you have
                  forgotten your commandments, Hector. If I recollect right, my mother taught them
                  to you."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think she did; long time ago, though."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid your present master and mistress do not set you a good example. Who
                  is your master?"</p>
               <p>Hector rubbed his head, with a perplexed air.</p>
               <p>"I got no master jist now; I run away."</p>
               <p>"Bad case, Hector. But what is his name?"</p>
               <p>"Master Arnold, he calls him."</p>
               <p>Marcus felt his blood bound in his veins. Providence had directed him to that lone
                  hovel. The lightning's flash was the flaming beacon to guide his track. That he
                  should discover an old family-servant, though in the equivocal act of robbing him,
                  was a most interesting incident; that he should be escaping from the very man of
                  whom he was in search himself, and to whom he could certainly direct him, was
                     indeed<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6692-00000096"/> deed providential. Seating
                  himself on the wooden frame, he drew from Hector a clear statement of all he was
                  most desirous to learn. As we can probably give it in fewer words than the
                  African, we will explain to the reader all he repeated to Marcus.</p>
               <p>Arnold was indeed bound for Texas, as Marcus had supposed—what particular locality
                  he had selected, the negro could not tell. He had sent on detachments of his
                  slaves, under the charge of overseers, at different times before his departure,
                  and they were all to meet somewhere on this side of the Mississippi river.
                  Sickness had broken out among them, so that they had been detained on their
                  journey, and there had been an evident spirit of rebellion among the negroes, who
                  most of them had been compelled to sunder some tie of nature or of love. Hector,
                  who had pleaded hard with his master to purchase his wife, so that she might
                  accompany him, and had been coldly refused, started with hard and vindictive
                  feelings, and a determination to run away the first moment he could elude the
                  vigilance of his master. This he had done two nights before. He had sought refuge
                  in the ruined hut from the terrors of the thunder-storm, where he had kindled a
                  blaze and eaten the food some pitying slave had given him on the way. He had heard
                  Marcus fastening his horse under the stoup, and concealed himself behind the
                  planks, where he crouched till the young traveller was asleep, when "old Satan
                  tempted," he said, "to see what young master got in his pillow." Marcus resolved
                  to write to Mr. Bellamy, and inform him of the discovery he had made, and to send
                  Hector immediately to Hickory Hill with the letter. He had no reliance on his
                  fidelity; but as his wife lived in that vicinity, and as he assured him that Mr.
                  Bellamy would reward him liberally, he hoped the intelligence would reach his
                  benefactor, and relieve him of much anxiety. He gave Hector money to lift him
                  above the temptation of stealing, and a written passport, which he might exhibit,
                  if arrested on his way.</p>
               <p>The storm had now subsided, and the thunder, low and sullen, rolled at an
                  immeasurable distance. Too much excited to think of sleep, Marcus resolved to push
                  on, after having made Hector again repeat every minutia connected with the route
                  he was to take. Hector, imitating the zeal and energy of the young man, determined
                  to plunge out into the night also, thinking it better for a runaway to rest at
                  noon in the deep woods, and avail himself of the curtain of darkness to speed his
                  flight.</p>
               <p>"Now, Hector," said Marcus, as they turned in opposite directions, "be faithful to
                  your trust, as you hope for a liberal reward; and if you fall in with a sleeping
                  traveller, have a little more respect for his head than you had for mine, and not
                  deprive it quite so suddenly of a pillow. I really think there must be a contusion
                  here," added he, passing his hand laughingly over the back of his head.</p>
               <p>"I think there 'tusion on my arm, young master," answered Hector, shrugging his
                  shoulders; "but me no right to complain. Me take great liberty, sure enough.
                  Good-by, master. Give my best 'spects to master Arnold, when you see him."</p>
               <p>The mocking laugh of the runaway rang through the damp air. Marcus remembered that
                  laugh, though he had not heard it since he was a very little boy. Such a laugh
                  never issued before from human lungs—so loud, so long, so voluminous, it burst
                  from the mouth like a cannon-ball, and went rolling into space, echoing as it
                  went, gathering sound and force, when suddenly it ceased, checked at once in
                  mid-volley. This miraculous laugh had won him the name of "Laughing Hector"—a
                  distinction of which he was very proud; and Laughing Hector had turned his
                  peculiar talent to great account; for young men, and maidens too, were in the
                  habit of paying him for one of his distinguished laughs, which were entirely
                  independent of mirth or wit. When Marcus heard this magnificent laugh, rolling
                  through the silence of the night, he could not help giving a merry response, while
                  ten thousand reminiscences of life's earliest days were wakened by its echoes.</p>
               <p>The next day a great misfortune befell Marcus. He deemed<pb n="194-195"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000097"/> it such, though it eventually proved a blessing.
                  Ah! these blessings in disguise. How often the wayfarer of life meets them in his
                  journey, and knows them not! The pilgrim sees not the angel through the garb that
                  conceals him; in doubting and darkness he follows his mysterious guide, till a
                  revelation of divine glory bursts upon his vision, and the ways of Providence are
                  justified to misjudging man.</p>
               <p>Just as he was approaching a comfortable looking dwelling, that promised shelter
                  and rest for himself and weary horse, the animal stumbled and threw his rider on a
                  rocky ledge, with a force that produced insensibility. Fortunately, he was near
                  the dwelling of man, where he could receive the ministrations his helpless state
                  demanded. No bones were broken, nor any serious internal injury received; but such
                  was the violence of the fall it was impossible for him to resume his journey for
                  several days. Marcus chafed with burning impatience under this unexpected delay.
                  The nice couch on which he was laid gave him no more rest than Guatemozin found on
                  his bed of coals. It was the first time he had ever been constrained to submit to
                  a state of passive endurance, and at this moment it was agonizing to him. The
                  fever of impatience kept him captive longer than he would have been, had he borne
                  his confinement with calmness and resignation; but he was at length able to resume
                  his journey, which he did with feelings of unspeakable gratitude.</p>
               <p>"Thank Heaven!" he exclaimed, when once more pursuing his impeded course; "it
                  might have been worse. I feel renovated, joyous, and my horse has renewed his
                  strength. He bears me on with the fleetness of the antelope. Oh! for Mazeppa's

               </p>
               <p>One flashing thought of Byron brought all the grand and gorgeous imagery of his
                  poems before the mind of Marcus. He was no longer lonely. The woods through which
                  he rode became thronged with wondrous travellers. The Giaour came thundering on
                  his raven steed; and Lelia "shining in her white symar;" the corsair with his
                  "glittering casque and sable plume, more glittering eye and black brow's sabler
                  plume;" followed by the dark-eyed Gulnare, and the fair-haired Medora; Selim and
                  the lovely Zuleika; the dark cloud spanned by the rainbow; Lara, the being of
                  "dark imaginings," with the unknown page linked with such fond devotion to his
                  gloomy destiny; one and all, they rushed along with him, swift as the breeze that
                  blew back his horse's flowing mane. Then the forest was converted into a grand
                  picture gallery, where Shakspeare's wizard pencil drew immortal groups. From the
                  witches of Macbeth, the ghosts of Banquo, to Oberon and Titania's fairy court, he
                  saw them all. As the camel, when travelling the desert sands of Arabia, far from
                  the river's flow and the fountain's gush, moistens his dry throat from the
                  reservoir within, so he refreshed his loneliness from the well-springs of memory,
                  and went on his way with a sparkling brightness of spirit, which even the long
                  trailing, melancholy moss, which here and there hung its funeral drapery on the
                  trees, could not sweep away.</p>

               <p>IT was a wild scene. The camp-fires were blazing along the edge of the woods.
                  Baggage-wagons, from which the horses and mules were taken, served as tents for
                  the sick and infantine travellers. Clusters of black faces were grouped together;
                  the light reflected from their charcoal surface as from mirrors of polished jet.
                  Dark, shining constellations they looked, scattered all about among the shadows
                  that were here and there illumined by the intense radiance of the pine-torch
                  light, and at intervals rolled together in an opaque, ebon mass.</p>
               <pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC6692-00000098"/>
               <p>There was an air of weariness, and sullenness, and discontent about all these
                  groups. They looked travel-worn and soiled. Some were washing their blistered
                  feet, others mending their torn garments. Mothers were endeavouring to hush the
                  cries of their infants, trying alternately the effect of a caress and a blow,
                  till, overcome with fatigue, they dropped asleep over the struggling burden in
                  their arms. It is true, there were some blither notes in different parts of the
                  encampment. Some young and India-rubber beings, the moment the strain of the day's
                  journey was over, would dance and sing, to the scraping of the violin and the
                  drumming of the tambourine. There were monkey-faced children cutting indescribable
                  antics on the ground for the amusement of their elders, making somersets faster
                  than the beholder could count; tying themselves apparently in double knots, and
                  cutting themselves in two; then flying together again as if nothing had
                  happened—juvenile Ravels, self-taught, flexible as whalebone, and graceful as the
                  willow. These merry, elfish, supernatural-looking creatures relieved the monotony
                  and weariness of the scene, and converted it into a gipsy revel. Pots simmering
                  over the fire, and red handkerchiefs gleaming from the brows of the women,
                  increased the resemblance to a Bohemian rendezvous.</p>
               <p>A tent was pitched in the centre of this large encampment, where the master of
                  these sable beings was reposing, after the toils of an itinerant day. A glass
                  lantern, suspended by a cord from the apex of the tent, gave light to the
                  interior, and streamed down on the face of the gentleman, who was reclining on a
                  pallet of straw, attentively engaged in reading a newspaper. He looked haggard and
                  uneasy, as well he might. Unforeseen difficulties had retarded his unrighteous
                  expedition. Sickness had broken out among his negroes, and he had been compelled
                  to linger for a detachment that had been ordered to meet him at a particular
                  point. Then the runaway Hector might wake the bloodhounds of pursuit to scent his
                  track. One of his overseers, after an angry altercation, had that very day left
                  him with covert threats and malicious insinuations nuations. Let him but once
                  cross the Mississippi. Let that mighty volume of water only roll between him and
                  the friends he had wronged, he would feel safer and at ease. At ease! No! his
                  conscience was not yet seared. He was not an old offender. He was naturally of a
                  careless, convivial spirit, hating trouble and dreading poverty; but he was easily
                  swayed by the will of others, and warped to evil his better nature would have
                  shunned. The influence that should have been all-powerful for good was exerted for
                  ill. He had married a few years before, for his second wife, a lady of a hard and
                  worldly character; a widow of reputed wealth; and the mother of the young man
                  Pellam, who had spoken so insultingly of Marcus at Wood Lawn. Marcus, though he
                  had seen Mr. Arnold at Bellamy Place, was not aware of this connection, and as he
                  had been absent for years, it was not strange it had never been alluded to in his
                  presence. Mrs. Arnold had preceded her husband with some relatives who resided in
                  Texas; her son travelled with his stepfather, was now the sharer of his tent, and
                  seated on a camp-stool near the entrance, where the canvas was rolled up to admit
                  the night air, that came fresh and dewy from the sweet southwest. Pellam looked
                  dull and sleepy. The head he had borne so loftily in the presence of Marcus hung
                  lazily on one side. He was playing with an open penknife, sometimes paring his
                  nails, and sometimes sticking it through the canvas, for the mere pleasure of
                  destructiveness. A leathern belt, containing a bowie-knife and pistol, girdled his
                  waist. Arnold was also armed. Two white men, who seemed to be overseers, were
                  walking about the encampment, which gradually became more still, till at length
                  nothing was heard but the hoarse voice of the waterfall, leaping mid the current
                  of the creek that washed the skirts of the woods which sheltered the place of
                  their repose. The paper dropped from the hands of Arnold. Pellam threw himself on
                  the pallet by his side. They both fell asleep. The rays of the lantern glared
                  brightly on their faces. So has the warrior slept on the tented field, while the
                  foe, whom he thought remote, was<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC6692-00000099"/> coming
                  armed with vengeance, making the obscurity of night subservient to his will. So
                  has the doomed one slept, while the bolt that was to fall upon him was forged in
                  the armory of heaven.</p>
               <p>Arnold was awakened, but it was with no downy touch. A strong grasp was on his
                  right arm. A firm hand pressed upon his breast. He struggled, panted, and threw
                  off the pressure that held him down, but the grasp was on his arm, and a figure
                  before his eyes that dazzled, bewildered him, and for one moment he believed
                  himself arrested by superhuman agency. The eyes bent upon him were clear, serene,
                  and of terrible brightness. They were like the noonday sunbeams, too intense to
                  meet, and the face from which they beamed seemed enwreathed with a halo, so bright
                  were the locks that floated round it. There was another figure by its side,
                  taller, larger, darker—more of the earth, earthy. Arnold began to realize his
                  situation.</p>
               <p>"What, ho!" he cried, leaping from the pallet, and writhing to free himself from
                  the hand of steel. "What, ho! Pellam, rouse, I say. Unhand me."</p>
               <p>Pellam, who was in a leaden sleep, roused by the outcries of Arnold, sprang up and
                  instinctively drew a pistol from his belt. Marcus recognised instantaneously the
                  young man who had sought to degrade him in the eyes of L'éclair, and, previously
                  excited, his blood boiled in his veins. He had never forgotten the insult, and he
                  rejoiced that an opportunity now offered when he could grapple with him, and
                  satisfy that stern sense of justice every man feels in the presence of those who
                  have wronged him.</p>
               <p>"Here," said he to the strong man at his side, "prevent his escape; the authority
                  is in your hands."</p>
               <p>Then surrendering Arnold to the officer of justice, he turned upon Pellam, who was
                  aiming a pistol at his breast. Marcus wrenched it from his hand and threw it upon
                  the ground. Pellam, though naturally cowardly, felt as if it were a life-struggle,
                  and he hated Marcus, the successful lover of Florence, with a deep and deadly
                  hatred. Drawing his bowie knife, he made a fierce plunge at his antagonist, but
                  only cut through the air. Marcus was unrivalled in the art of fencing, and though
                  this was the first time he was ever engaged in mortal fight, he was more than
                  equal to the strife. He was armed, but instead of drawing his own knife, he seized
                  the wrist of Pellam, and the knife gleamed and glanced between them coldly,
                  bluely, destructively, but colder, bluer, more destructive gleamed the eyes of
                  Marcus on the face of his foe. The fierce delight that a brave man feels in deeds
                  of strife quivered on his lip, and lighted up his features. He was transformed.
                  There was a deadly beauty in his face. It might, indeed, be said of him at this
                  moment, in the beautiful, hyperbolical language of the Canticles, "He was bright
                  as the sun, fair as the moon, and terrible as an army with banners."</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Arnold was struggling manfully with the officer, who had come
                  armed with legal authority to arrest him.</p>
               <p>"What, ho!" again he cried, in vociferous tones. "Brandon—Peters—where are the
                  rascals? Come to the rescue; I defy the warrant."</p>
               <p>The men thus summoned, previously aroused by the tumult, came rushing into the
                  tent, which soon became a battle-ground. The whole encampment was, by this time, a
                  scene of indescribable confusion. The dogs were barking and howling, the negroes
                  running to and fro, partly comprehending the deep interest they had in the
                  conflict. A fortification of black figures was seen outside of the tent, growing
                  broader and broader as the strife deepened. It was becoming fearfully exciting;
                  four against two. The overseers were strong, rough men, well skilled in the use of
                  the bowie knife and all destructive weapons. They were also initiated in the
                  refined art of gouging, an accomplishment of frequent use in the butchery of
                  man.</p>
               <p>Marcus, who had thrown Pellam to the ground, and wrenched the knife from his
                  grasp, rushed upon these men now bearing down upon the sheriff, who had been
                  exerting all his strength<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC6692-00000100"/> to retain his
                  hold of the prisoner, desperate and struggling as he was. He did not want to shed
                  blood, he did not want his own blood shed, but it was shed already. There was a
                  gash in his left arm, and a red stream running over his hand. Marcus saw it, and
                  the sight inflamed his passion with tenfold power. He fought with fury, but
                  against fearful odds. He fought for life, for justice, for vengeance. He thought
                  not whether he spilled blood or not. He had <emph>right</emph> and
                     <emph>might</emph> on his side; but it was now three against one. Three! it was
                  four; for Pellam had risen, Arnold was free; the officer reeled with failing
                  strength. Marcus turned upon them all, like the stag at bay, believing himself
                  lost, but strong, brave, unyielding to the last. There was a smile of defiance and
                  scorn upon his lip. His eye was the lightning, flashing from the clear blue
                  heavens. But listen,—other footsteps come rushing to the tent. The black wall
                  gives way. A loud, thrilling cry! It is echoed by the negroes. More enemies! He is
                  lost. But hark! he knows that shout. See, he knows those coal-black, burning eyes;
                  he knows those gray locks, that slightly bent, but commanding form. Great heavens!
                  Delaval—his father! How came they there? Is it a dream? Is he going mad? With a
                  sudden, sharp cry, he springs and falls. A knife has stabbed him through the back.
                  The villain dare not face him. 'Tis Pellam. The conflict goes on over the bleeding
                  and insensible body of Marcus. <emph>Right</emph> and <emph>might</emph> at last
                  prevail.</p>
               <p>There was a blank in the existence of Marcus; how long he knew not. When he again
                  opened his dim eyes, he saw around him the burning sands of the desert. He was
                  travelling through them, though, every step he made in the hot, arid path, he
                  tottered and panted, and his breath came like flame from his lips. He could see in
                  the distance the green oases, those Edens of the sandy wilderness; he could hear
                  the sweet, pensive, soothing voice of the fountain; sometimes, through the sultry
                  air, there would flow a stream of balmy freshness; but it was so vanishing, he
                  scarcely felt that it had been near. If he could only reach that fountain, bathe
                  his feverish brow in its waters, and die! This was the prayer of his soul. He
                  strove to drag his weary feet, they sank deeper and deeper in the hot sand. He
                  fell prostrate on his face, and the scorching simoom swept over him just as he was
                  panting out his life on this burning bed. Oh, joy! oh, rapture! a spring comes
                  welling up on the very spot where he lies. The waters touch his parched and
                  thirsty lips; he looks down, he sees the long, feathery moss waving, softly waving
                  in the deep, pellucid fount. He looks up; the long, shining leaves, the glorious,
                  waxen, odoriferous blossoms of the magnolia are bending over him, swaying,
                  gracefully, lightly, in the gentle wind. That blessed wind—how it cools, how it
                  refreshes his dry and weary spirit! How he tries to breathe forth his depth of
                  gratitude! Yes, it is his own spring, his beloved Long Moss Spring, born anew in
                  that desert by a miracle of divine love. With a feeling of blissful confidence in
                  that love, he closes his eyes, and a delicious slumber steals over his senses.</p>
               <p>When Marcus awoke, the desert, the oasis, the fountain had vanished. The mirage
                  had faded away. He was lying in a darkened chamber, in which the stillness of
                  death reigned. He could see through the muslin curtains that shaded his bed the
                  outlines of a manly figure, but he could not turn his head. He was so weak that he
                  could not prevent his eyelids from closing with a soft slumberous weight.
                  "Father," he whispered. It was a very faint whisper, but it was heard by the
                  watching ear, made miraculously acute by intense anxiety. The figure sank on its
                  knees by the bed-side, its head was bowed in its hands, and sobs were distinctly
                  audible.</p>
               <p>Long had Mr. Warland been keeping watch by what was believed would be the
                  death-bed of Marcus. He had watched him in the wild ravings of delirium induced by
                  the agony of his wound, in the still more alarming stupor that succeeded, while
                  the physician admitted only the possibility of his recovery. He could not
                  encourage the faintest hope, though he would not utterly extinguish it. But he,
                  Marcus, had looked, he had spoken with intelligence. The wandering spirit had<pb
                     n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6692-00000101"/> come back to its home. The eye, dim and
                  heavy as it was, the light of reason was there, and hope and joy were born
                  anew.</p>
               <p>We will now explain the apparently miraculous appearance of Mr. Warland and
                  Delaval at the moment when Marcus was sinking beneath the stroke of the assassin.
                     <emph>Laughing Hector</emph> had been true to the trust confided in him. A
                  remarkable pedestrian, he had arrived in an incredibly short time at Bellamy
                  Place, and delivered the letter to its master. Both Mr. Bellamy and Warland felt
                  increasing solicitude about Marcus. They regretted they had yielded to his
                  boldness and impetuosity. It is true they believed that Arnold was located
                     <emph>somewhere,</emph> and that he would find him in the quietude of home,
                  where it would be easy to arrest him; but when they heard the statement of Hector,
                  and realized the probable end of the adventure, should Marcus encounter him in the
                  fastnesses of the woods, surrounded by his own people, opposing coolness, and
                  treachery, and policy to youth, rashness, and inexperience, they determined to
                  follow and assist him. Delaval, who was at Hickory Hill, proved his friendship to
                  Marcus, by leaving Katy, whom he had found fairer and dearer than ever, and taking
                  the place of Mr. Bellamy, as the companion of the father of his friend. The delay
                  occasioned by the fall of Marcus from his horse proved his salvation, for it gave
                  time for his friends to overtake him, at an hour when they were most needed.
                  Marcus had had the wisdom to secure the assistance of the sheriff of the county
                  through which he ascertained Arnold was travelling, though he was not aware that
                  he was about to encounter the envious and vindictive Pellam. The result of the
                  conflict in the tent, as we have said before, was the triumph of justice. One of
                  the overseers was killed—the other yielded. Pellam fled as soon as he saw Marcus
                  fall, and Arnold was compelled to give up the useless struggle by Warland, who,
                  goaded to phrensy by the sight of his prostrate and bleeding son, put forth the
                  strength of a giant. The negroes were taken by virtue of the warrant, and he
                  himself continued his course to Texas, where his wife awaited him.</p>
               <p>Marcus was removed to the nearest habitation. Delaval, though his yearning heart
                  longed to plead the sacred rights of friendship, knew that a father's rights were
                  holier still, and, yielding his place by the bedside, he assumed another and very
                  heavy responsibility. The negroes must have a master. They must be conducted home.
                  The remaining overseer, who had not understood the true position of Arnold's
                  affairs, was willing to enter the service of Delaval. The place of the other was
                  supplied by a better man.</p>
               <p>If there is any want of clearness in this explanation, it must be imputed to our
                  dislike to go back, and enter into dry and business-like details. We plead guilty
                  to a desire to hurry them over as quickly as possible. As the traveller rides
                  rapidly through a flat and barren region, that he may arrive at the green and
                  smiling country wooing him in the distance; so we will only add, in connection
                  with this part of the history, that the slaves, who, sullen and reluctant, had
                  been dragging forward unwilling steps, turned back with cheerful and rejoicing
                  spirits, glad to exchange a careless and selfish master for the young and spirited
                  Delaval.</p>
               <p>For weeks Marcus lay in a languishing condition. The wound had come very near the
                  citadel of life. One hair's-breadth nearer would have been death. Besides his
                  father, he had a kind negro nurse, who reminded him of Aunt Milly, for she always
                  wore a peaked turban and white starched apron. One evening, she told him she was
                  sent for to wait upon a lady, but a young mulatto girl would take her place, who
                  was used to taking care of the sick, and had "mighty gentle, pretty ways." Marcus
                  was in that languid, feeble state, that state of perfect quiescence, he felt no
                  interest in any change which might be going on around him. But he was still
                  conscious of an agreeable transition, when the young mulatto glided round him,
                  instead of the kind but somewhat officious negro woman. He was not yet considered
                  out of danger, and the footsteps that hovered near him had to be soft "as snow on
                  snow." Rosa—for that was the name of the young girl—might have<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000102"/> passed for a snowflake, from the lightness of her
                  step, and her voice was very low and soft. Even the sight of the green blind that
                  covered her eyes was refreshing to his enfeebled vision. It was in consequence of
                  this weakness of the eyes that she was placed as nurse over the sick, an office
                  she seemed to love, and for which nature had peculiarly adapted her. It was only,
                  however, the lighter offices, such as brushing away the flies, giving water and
                  medicine, that she was appointed to perform. There were gratuitous services also
                  she took peculiar pleasure in rendering, such as adorning the room with flowers,
                  and even strewing them on his pillow. She seemed to have a passion for roses, and
                  would sometimes bring in a whole apron full, and twist them in garlands for the
                  looking-glass and mantel-piece. Her chief employment was waving a gorgeous brush
                  of peacock's feathers over his bed, to keep off the intruding flies. Marcus, who
                  had nothing else to do, loved to watch the light movements of his gentle nurse.
                  She reminded him of Cora, though her complexion wanted the golden brightness of
                  that ill-starred bride, and the beautiful gazelle-eyes were wanting, that gave
                  such a charm to Cora's beaming face. She was very modest, seldom spoke, unless
                  addressed; but Marcus was struck with the propriety of her language, in comparison
                  with most of her race. As he grew stronger she became more communicative, and told
                  him that her young mistress had taught her to read, and that she had lived with
                  her more as a companion than a slave.</p>
               <p>"I love my young mistress as well as I do myself," said the grateful Rosa. "She
                  could not be kinder to herself than she has always been to me."</p>
               <p>"Why do you not stay with her?" asked Marcus.</p>
               <p>"She is gone a long journey, and it is bad for weak eyes to ride in the sun. A
                  sick-chamber, where the curtains are all down, is the best place for them."</p>
               <p>But Marcus was soon able to sit up in an easy-chair, and look abroad upon the
                  beautiful world he had been so near quitting for ever. The inexpressible languor
                  that had been weighing upon him, softly but oppressively, like a downy covering,
                  began to disperse. The spring, the elasticity of life, returned. He longed to be
                  once more in action. The wounded bird endures passively the confinement of the
                  cage; but the moment the wings gain strength, they beat against the prison-bars,
                  and strive for the blue sky and the open air.</p>
               <p>One night he was seated by the open window, through which the moon was shining,
                  making silver checker-work on the floor. His face was as white as marble, while
                  his eyes looked unusually dark and luminous. Rosa came in with a bouquet of
                  beautifully arranged flowers, and handed them to him without speaking. As she was
                  standing, with her head a little one side, a natural position of hers, she could
                  see beneath her green shade his pale yet lustrous countenance, and she seemed
                  struck with its extraordinary beauty. She sighed, and turned toward the window,
                  where the moon looked directly down on her own deep, olive cheek.</p>
               <p>"What can I ever do for you, Rosa?" said Marcus, in a gentle voice, gazing with
                  admiration on the lovely outline of her face, to which the moonbeams were now
                  giving a pale silver edging. "You have spoiled me by your kind, unceasing
                  attentions. I do not know what I shall do without you. If it were not for my
                  friends, I could almost regret getting well, and being obliged to leave you."</p>
               <p>"You will soon forget the poor mulatto," answered Rosa, in a tremulous voice,
                  "while she will think of the time spent in your sick chamber as the happiest of
                  her whole life."</p>
               <p>There was something in the tone, the manner, that startled Marcus, that gave him a
                  feeling of unutterable pain. There was a pathos, a hopelessness,—he could not deny
                  it,—a <emph>love</emph> in the tones, that, combined as it was with the
                  recollection of her unwearied devotion, her sleepless cares, her flowery offering,
                  her gentle sighs, invested her with a romance in that soft, silvery hour, as
                  painful as it was singular.</p>
               <p>"I cannot be so ungrateful as to forget one who has been so kind to me," he
                  replied; "I shall talk about you to<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC6692-00000103"/> my
                  friends, to my sweet sister. We shall all remember Rosa."</p>
               <p>"Who are Florence and L'éclair, that you used to talk about in your sleep? Which
                  is your sister?" asked she, "and why have they not been to see you?"</p>
               <p>"They are too far off," he replied. "My sister did wish to come, but as my father
                  was here himself, he thought she had better not. Florence and L'éclair are one and
                  the same person."</p>
               <p>"Do you love her?" asked the mulatto, in a very low voice.</p>
               <p>"Better than life, better than my own soul," answered Marcus, with a fervour that
                  brought the blood warmly, brightly to his pallid cheek.</p>
               <p>"How happy she must be," exclaimed Rosa, drawing back into the shade, as if she
                  feared the lustre that surrounded her would reveal her inmost soul; "how happy
                  those must be who love each other. I never shall see one of my own colour that I
                  can love, and the poor mulatto dare not cast her eyes beyond her tribe."</p>
               <p>Marcus began to feel the deepest embarrassment. It was evident his pretty, gentle,
                  child-like young nurse regarded him with emotions he was far from wishing to
                  inspire. The lingering debility of illness rendered him more susceptible to
                  tenderness and compassion, and he felt pity for her infatuation, rather than anger
                  at her presumption. Poor, refined young creature! How could she feel any
                  congeniality with the beings of her tribe? She seemed formed for no office more
                  rude than to gather roses, and wave the sun-eyed plumes over the couch of
                  sickness. He shuddered to think of her ever being associated with her more sable
                  brethren.</p>
               <p>"Can I do any thing more for you, young master?" said she, in a tone of touching
                  humility.</p>
               <p>"No, I thank you," replied Marcus. "You had better retire."</p>
               <p>She hesitated a moment, approached the door, then paused, and returned a few
                  steps.</p>
               <p>"I am going away to-morrow," she said; "my young mistress has sent for me. You are
                  now so nearly well, you can do without much waiting on; at any rate, you will be
                  going away yourself directly."</p>
               <p>"To-morrow," repeated Marcus. He was unwilling to acknowledge to himself how
                  reluctant he felt to be separated from his interesting nurse. There was a charm
                  about her, whose influence he had felt, when she first entered with downy
                  footsteps his then darkened room. "To-morrow; that is very soon."</p>
               <p>He wanted to give her some token of gratitude. He could not offer her money; that
                  would degrade too much her heartfelt services. He had a ring on his finger, a ruby
                  ring, that was the amulet given him by Mrs. Bellamy. He could not part with that.
                  He had a locket, containing Katy's hair, suspended from a gold chain in his bosom.
                  This was a fitting memorial, and this he gave her. The blood rushed visibly to her
                  dark cheek, she trembled with emotion.</p>
               <p>"One more favour," she said. "Don't think me bold; one lock of your hair, to put
                  with this beautiful dark one; Rosa never will part with it."</p>
               <p>Running to the table with the eagerness of a child, she caught up a pair of
                  scissors, and held them toward him. Marcus laughed, but he could not help
                  blushing, as he shook forward the long locks that waved back from his
                  forehead.</p>
               <p>"Cut it yourself," said he, "if you care about it. I can spare it very well from
                  this golden fleece."</p>
               <p>Passing her little, soft, dark fingers through the luxuriant clusters, she severed
                  a tress, and holding it up in the moonbeams, laughed with childish delight.
                  "Beautiful! beautiful!" she exclaimed, "prettier than the chain, prettier than the
                  locket. Thank you, thank you for this."</p>
               <p>Turning round, and touching it lightly to her lips, she vanished from the
                  room.</p>
               <p>"What a child of Nature she is!" thought Marcus. "She<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000104"/> seems as beautiful as Cora, and a hundred times
                  more refined. Poor Rosa!"</p>
               <p>The next morning, the black boy, who had acted as her under servant during her
                  administrations to him, brought him a fresh cluster of flowers, saying Rosa had
                  sent it, as a parting gift. "She would not bid him good-bye," the boy said,
                  "because she was afraid she should cry."</p>
               <p>Marcus felt as if there were a blank in his being. The fairy-like step, the gentle
                  hand that had given such a charm to his sick room were now gone. He was certain he
                  would have died if it had not been for her unwearied ministrations. Kind and
                  devoted as his father had been, he was a <emph>man.</emph> He would sit up with
                  him night after night, sleepless and tireless. He would make any sacrifice of
                  personal ease to paternal love; but he was a <emph>man,</emph> and never thought
                  of those little nameless attentions, so inexpressibly soothing to those reduced to
                  childlike weakness. 'Tis woman, whose soft hand bathes the feverish brow and
                  smooths the ruffled pillow, fans the burning cheek and decorates the apartment, so
                  as to gladden the weary eye. It was thus Rosa had done, and notwithstanding the
                  dark hue that divided her from him as a natural barrier, he never could recall,
                  without thrilling interest, her fidelity, devotion, and artless love.</p>
               <p>In a short time he was able to commence his journey, travelling slowly at first,
                  with intervals of rest, but gathering vigour and spirit every mile that brought
                  him nearer to Bellamy Place.</p>
               <p>No hero returned from a glorious campaign was ever welcomed with more enthusiasm
                  than Marcus. Exalted by courage and endeared by danger, the feelings he inspired
                  partook more of idolatry than common affection. He did not feel that he had in any
                  way cancelled the debt of gratitude; but he rejoiced he had been enabled to be of
                  use to his benefactor. Nor was it alone at Hickory Hill he received the honours
                  due to a hero. The fame of his heroic actions spread far and wide. It was blazoned
                  in the newspapers, discussed in the streets, talked about in the private circle.
                  His youth, talents, and dauntless resolution, his extraordinary personal
                  endowments, were the exhaustless topics of the day. Never did a young man commence
                  a public career under more splendid auspices. He did not select a large city as
                  the theatre of his professional labours. He remembered the advice of Judge
                  Cleveland on that subject. "Young men," said that wise and excellent man, "are apt
                  to seek distinction in the very places where their separate existence is
                  unrecognised. In a large and populous city, where the professions are crowded,
                  they have to wait for those occasions, which so rarely occur, to elicit
                  distinguished talent or brilliant genius. Let them rather choose a small town,
                  with wealthy surroundings; let them make the <emph>place</emph> celebrated by
                  their own renown, and then they may 'take the wings of the morning and fly to the
                  uttermost parts of the sea,' if they will; the light of their reputation will
                  follow them."</p>
               <p>It was just such a spot as this, in his native State, that Marcus selected to make
                  himself a name and fame, that should go abroad into the world; to cultivate the
                     <emph>vineyard,</emph> to build the <emph>bower,</emph> that, covered with the
                  rosy bloom of love, might woo to its sweet retreat the bright and beloved
                  L'éclair.</p>
               <p>Delaval, the friend of his youth, was the betrothed of his sister, so that he had
                  a prospect of being united to him by a two-fold cord. The young master of Wood
                  Lawn had not commenced his career as a lawyer. He had taken possession of his
                  estate; and though Mr. Alston still resided with him, he had no longer the
                  authority to dictate, as his aristocracy prompted. The uncle considered it his
                  especial duty to choose a wife for Delaval—an <emph>irreproachable
                     connection;</emph> but he found the nephew, as well as niece, had a strong
                  will, and preferred choosing for himself.</p>
               <p>"In one year from this time," said Delaval, "the sweetest violet that ever sought
                  the shade shall beautify with its modest charms my Wood Lawn home."</p>
               <p>"In one year," cried Marcus, "I can transplant my wild<pb n="210-211"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000105"/> Passion-flower, where it shall bloom gloriously in
                  the sunshine of my heart."</p>
               <p>One year! Marcus believed in perennial sunshine. He felt it warming, shining
                  within. He saw it sparkling, shining without. He thought of no cloud. Why should
                  he, when the firmament was one clear, blue, boundless arch; when no cloud, as big
                  as a man's hand, floated on the ether? But who would believe that the dew that
                  sparkles on the grass and the flowers contained the elements of the storm, that
                  may destroy their verdure and their bloom?</p>

               <p>FLORENCE sat at her favourite window, reading. She did not seem deeply engaged in
                  the contents of her book, for she would look up occasionally, with a soft, dreamy,
                  abstracted air, and suffer it to fall in her lap. Then leaning her head on her
                  hand, she would twist her fingers in a gold chain that encircled her neck, and
                  play with the locket that nestled in her bosom. That she had a subject of
                  reflection more pleasing than her book, was evident from the sweet, subdued
                  expression of her love-lighted face. She had told Marcus, in that very room, on
                  that very seat, that she dreaded the thought of love; that she knew, if she once
                  yielded to its influence, she would become a vassal to its will. Even when she was
                  boasting of her freedom, she was a captive to its power; but she was a Zenobia
                  bound in golden chains, a queen even in her captivity, disdaining to acknowledge
                  her subjection or pay homage to her victor. Now the pride that had resisted was
                  the strong auxiliary of her love. She gloried in having felt, even at the first
                  glance, the superiority, the genius, to which the world was beginning to bow. She
                  exulted in the thought, that if she had obeyed the great law of woman's
                  being,—that centripetal attraction which draws her irresistibly toward some
                  central and controlling force—she was a primary orb, revolving round no lesser
                  luminary, but tracing her dazzling path near one who was destined to be the
                  effulgent sun of the social system to which she belonged.</p>
               <p>But there was no pride mingled in the reflections which she was now indulging. All
                  the softness, the tenderness of woman's nature was floating in her eyes of eastern
                  splendour, and stealing over the rubies of her lips. She was thinking of Marcus,
                  not as the eloquent pleader, the intellectual gladiator, the bold vindicator of
                  outraged justice, such as he had taken his stand before the world; but as she had
                  last seen him, pallid and gentle, dependent on her cares, passive and grateful as
                  a child. She drew forth the locket, the pledge of his gratitude to his humble
                  attendant, and gazed on the beautiful, amber lock, now braided with Katy's
                  dark-brown hair.</p>
               <p>"Ah! little does he think," said she, smiling at the little romance of which she
                  was the unknown heroine, "whose hand administered to his helplessness. Little does
                  he think, when he so gently encircled the bending neck of the mulatto girl with
                  this golden chain, he was adding new and stronger links to the heart-fetters that
                  bind us to each other. Ah! how well I remember that moment—that holy, moonlight
                  hour! Down in the unfathomable depths of my spirit I felt his regal power. I was
                  clothed in the humility of the disguise I wore. I could have knelt at his feet,
                  borne down by the mighty burden of my love. How I longed to throw myself into his
                  arms, to weep upon his bosom, to breathe out the fulness of my gratitude that God
                  had given him back to life! But I resisted the temptation, and I rejoice that my
                  secret is safe. He never shall know, that in the delirium of my despair, the
                  madness of my love at the tidings of his danger, I was guilty of an act of
                  imprudence, for which even George has scarcely forgiven<pb n="212-213"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000106"/> me, good Mrs. Lewis preached me a thousand sermons,
                  and which, if my proud uncle knew, would end his perpendicularity and his life.
                  Blessings on the journey that took him from home at that very time. What if Marcus
                  should condemn me for it? Ah! I should wish myself the Lightning indeed, that I
                  might blast him for his ingratitude."</p>
               <p>"What is that, Letty?" she asked, as a negro girl came in with a packet in her
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"Something one of Master Patterson's men left as he go by," answered Letty, the
                  favourite attendant of Florence—one of the ugliest and shrewdest creatures that
                  can possibly be imagined. It is impossible to describe her face, but it gave one
                  the impression of being wrong side outward, and her extraordinary grimaces seemed
                  efforts to turn it right. Delaval said Florence kept this girl about her as a foil
                  for her beauty, but it was from a better motive. When Florence was a very little
                  girl, Letty, not a great deal older than herself, had saved her from drowning, and
                  in several instances had shown such a remarkable attachment that Florence rewarded
                  it by giving her the position she most desired, a place in the household, and near
                  her own person.</p>
               <p>Mr. Patterson was a gentleman who resided not very far from Wood Lawn. His son was
                  in college at the same time with Marcus and Delaval, and when he renewed his
                  acquaintance with the latter at his own home, he, like many others, paid his
                  addresses to the young heiress, receiving a courteous but decided refusal. Though
                  discarded as a lover, he still claimed the privileges of a friend, and Florence
                  often received books and papers and tokens of remembrance from him.</p>
               <p>She opened the packet. It contained several newspapers and a pamphlet. She thought
                  the papers might have some connection with Marcus, and she eagerly ran over the
                  columns. She was right. There were extracts from a speech he had made at a very
                  interesting trial, which had attracted great attention, and won him signal honour.
                  It was thrillingly eloquent, but as the editor remarked, "it wanted the voice of
                  deep, melodious persuasion, the magnetic eye, the graceful gesture, the personal
                  fascination that distinguished the youthful orator." Florence read, while the
                  generous pride one feels in the triumphs of a beloved friend swelled her
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"And this gifted being is mine," thought she. "The voice of millions will one day
                  justify my choice; and yet, he would be as dear to me if, unknown, unprized by the
                  world, he existed alone for love and me."</p>
               <p>"But what is this?" she said, opening the pamphlet. "Some political document,
                  fresh from Congress. For George, I suppose. When <emph>somebody</emph> makes the
                  dry bones shake there with his prophet voice, I will condescend to read all their
                  pamphlets."</p>
               <p>"You dropped something, Miss Florence," said Letty, picking up a letter from the
                  carpet. "I reckon it a love-letter."</p>
               <p>Florence took it, and read the superscription,—"Mr. Alfred Patterson." "He must
                  have sent this for me to read," said she, unfolding it. "But I cannot imagine what
                  interest I can have in his letters. Ah! I see—I understand."</p>
               <p>With a blush of pleasure she began its perusal. The blush faded. Calmness, and
                  even indifference succeeded. Then suddenly her brow contracted; her face reddened,
                  crimsoned; her eyes flashed like burning gas. She started up, dashed the letter on
                  the carpet, and pressed her foot crushingly upon it.</p>
               <p>"What the matter?—what the matter, Miss Florence?" cried Letty, in alarm.
                  "Something sting you? Wasp, yellow-jacket? Let me find him."</p>
               <p>"Stung? Yes! stung—stung through the heart. Don't speak to me—don't," cried she,
                  wildly, stamping her foot passionately on the paper.</p>
               <p>"Hornet in this letter," said Letty, grinning, and stooping to pick it up. "I kill
                  him, you see if I don't."</p>
               <p>"How dare you laugh?" exclaimed Florence, snatching the paper from her hands, and
                  walking the room with the step and look of a Delphi priestess, so intense was her
                  passion, so unut<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6692-00000107"/> terable its
                  expresssion. "Open the window," she cried. "I cannot breathe—I suffocate."</p>
               <p>Terrified at the frantic emotions, Letty leaped toward the window, at the risk of
                  plunging her ugly head through the panes, and opening it, pushed back the
                  curtains, then seizing a large feather fan, began to fan the scarlet cheeks of her
                  young mistress with great vehemence.</p>
               <p>Florence made an impatient gesture with her hand. "Leave me," she said, in a husky
                  voice. "I want to be alone—I must be alone."</p>
               <p>"I so sorry. I mighty sorry, Miss Florence," said the sympathizing negro. "What
                  can have happened to make you feel so bad? I do hope nothing the matter with
                  Master Marcus."</p>
               <p>Florence, who was leaning against the window, with both hands pressed against her
                  temples, turned round with such a look of indignation Letty was frightened, and
                  drew back two or three steps toward the door.</p>
               <p>"If you ever mention that name to me again, Letty," said Florence, her lips
                  curling with ineffable disdain, "you never enter my presence again. Remember. I
                  command everlasting silence."</p>
               <p>"Oh! mercy!" cried Letty, rubbing her head with both hands, and making a perfect
                  corkscrew of her face. "Oh! mercy! what can be the matter? Little time ago you go
                  way off, thinking nothing in the world of yourself so you save his life; no care
                  if you die, so he live. And Letty go with you, and know all 'bout it. Now you tell
                  me never speak his name. I dumb 'fore I learn that."</p>
               <p>Florence flew towards her with uplifted hand. She did not strike her, but she
                  brought that beautiful, soft hand down over the great thick lips it could scarcely
                  cover, and taking hold of her arm with the other hand, gave her an involuntary
                  momentum in the direction of the door she was constrained to follow. The moment
                  she was gone, Florence untwisted the golden chain from her neck.</p>
               <p>"I thought it would choke me," she cried. "And this locket—how it burned against
                  my heart!" Tossing it into the corner of the room, the proud heiress threw herself
                  on the carpet, as if crushed by some mighty wo, her face buried on her arms, her
                  hair sweeping round her, forming a night-shade for her grief and shame. Her frame
                  shook and quivered with the imprisoned fires of passion. Never, perhaps, had a
                  more sudden, terrible storm swept over a human heart. It was like the hurricane of
                  the tropic regions, blasting the rich bloom their burning sun had called
                  forth.</p>
               <p>It was thus her brother found her. A little while before he had passed the window
                  where she was seated, and she had looked up with such a sweet, happy smile. And
                  now she was lying on the floor, like one stricken down, crushed; she whose bright,
                  glad nature seemed impassible to suffering. Shocked, alarmed, he bent over her,
                  and tried to raise her, but she resisted the effort. He called her name, but she
                  made no answer.</p>
               <p>"Good heavens!" he cried, "what can be the matter. 'Tis terrible. 'Tis
                  convulsions—'tis catalepsy."</p>
               <p>He was about to rush out and call for assistance, when he caught a glimpse of the
                  paper she still clenched in her hand. Fearing he might tear it, he unclosed her
                  fingers, expecting to meet with strong resistance, but, to his astonishment, she
                  appeared unconscious of his touch, though not insensible. He read the letter in
                  the attitude in which he had taken it, kneeling on one knee, while she lay
                  prostrate and passive beside him. He read it through, and through again, before he
                  moved one muscle. His very breathing seemed suspended. Then he started on his feet
                  with an exclamation so startling, it caused a responsive movement in the seemingly
                  paralyzed limbs of Florence. She raised her head, and leaning on one elbow, looked
                  him in the face. But such a look! it made him shudder. The despair of an Ariadne
                  and the vengeance of a Medea were there.</p>
               <p>"Florence," said he, holding out the letter, and grinding his teeth as he spoke,
                  "how came you by this? Who sent it?"</p>
               <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6692-00000108"/>
               <p>"Who sent it?" repeated she, sitting up, and pushing back her thick, disordered
                  ringlets, while she passed her hand hurriedly over her brow. "Oh, indeed; who did
                  send it?"</p>
               <p>"By heavens, he's driven her mad!" exclaimed Delaval, "and me, too. I'll kill him.
                  Yes, I'll kill him, or he me. The whole earth shall not hold us both. By all the
                  powers of heaven and hell, she shall be avenged!"</p>
               <p>With a piercing shriek, Florence sprang from the floor, and threw her arms round
                  her brother.</p>
               <p>"No, no, no," she cried, "you shall not kill him; you shall not meet him. I will
                  not have any blood shed. No, no. What right have you to do it? This was all a
                  mistake. It came to me by mistake; he never meant I should see it. Oh, that
                     <emph>you</emph> had never seen it! Oh, George, how dare you snatch it from my
                  hand? I would not have had you see it for a thousand worlds."</p>
               <p>"Sister," said her brother, sternly, "if you are willing to brook an insult like
                  this, I tell you, it is well there is some one who knows how to maintain the
                  honour of the family. Is it possible, that it is <emph>you,</emph> Florence
                  Delaval, <emph>my</emph> sister, can look me in the face, and tell me that I shall
                  not avenge your wrongs!"</p>
               <p>She did look him in the face, with her dark, powerful, deprecating eyes. "Brother,
                  there are wrongs that cannot be avenged, and this is one. I am calmer now; you
                  must listen. I am not mad; I know what I am saying. This is a private letter,
                  fallen by accident into my hands. His private sentiments—that every man has a
                  right to express. Yes," she added, a bitter smile wreathing her pale and quivering
                  lips, "he has a right thus to think and thus to write, and no power on earth can
                  wrest it from him; and I have the right to despise, to hate, to loathe myself in
                  dust and ashes and sackcloth, for having loved this ingrate so wildly, blindly,
                  madly loved him."</p>
               <p>"Florence, you love him yet, I believe you do," said Delaval, fiercely. "If I
                  thought you did not despise, hate, loathe him, as much as you once loved, I could
                  see you die by my own hands, rather than live so degraded."</p>
               <p>"Oh, brother, that you would indeed kill me," she cried, sliding down from his
                  arms, and wrapping hers around his knees. "I am so wretched, so miserable; I don't
                  want to live. I feel so blasted, so crushed, so deadly sick at heart."</p>
               <p>"And yet you would have me sit down, like a tame fool, and say nothing," he cried.
                  "I swear, by all the gods of Olympus, that he, that false villain, shall meet me,
                  pistol to pistol, or knife to knife, and that one or the other shall be carried
                  dead from the field."</p>
               <p>"And as sure as you fulfil that dreadful oath," exclaimed she, clasping her hands
                  passionately together, and raising them above her head, "you destroy me for ever;
                  body and soul, you destroy me. I will not live. You will plunge me in the grave of
                  the suicide; you will drive me to an act for which there is no repentance, no
                  hope, no redemption. George, if you do not take back that fearful oath, if you do
                  not promise me, solemnly promise, now, this moment, your sister's blood will be on
                  your head, your sister's soul required at your hands."</p>
               <p>He tried to raise her, but she would not be raised. He tried to unclasp her
                  clinging arms, but she only clung the tighter, repeating, "Promise, George; I
                  never will release you, till you promise to forbear."</p>
               <p>"I promise, then," cried he, sullenly, "and eternal disgrace rest upon us
                  both."</p>
               <p>She released her arms, and fell forward, weeping. A sudden, violent gush of tears
                  relieved the tension of her brain. She was now passive as an infant. He found no
                  difficulty in lifting her, and seating her on the window-seat by his side, his
                  arms still surrounding her. While she lay, weeping, sob bing on his bosom, dark
                  and stormy thoughts swept through it. All his own dreams of happiness were fled
                  with hers. The blow that severed her from Marcus must sunder the bond that bound
                  him to Katy. This would be the inevitable result Then his friendship, his ardent,
                  disinterested, trusting friendship<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6692-00000109"/>
                  ship; what a deep, immedicable wound it had received! Never more could he trust in
                  human virtue or truth. Never more "garner up his heart" in the heart of another.
                  His hot southern blood boiled at the thought of passive endurance of the most
                  galling insult. He writhed at the remembrance of his exacted promise. It seemed as
                  if he were a base, dishonoured coward, a vile, mealy-mouthed hypocrite. Pellam was
                  right. This son of a ferryman and overseer was unworthy to mate with them, or any
                  honourably descended individuals. Then a sudden doubt startled him. Could he
                  indeed have written that letter? He seized hold of this doubt; he grasped it, as
                  the drowning man the twig that floats on the stream.</p>
               <p>Suddenly, as if by a simultaneous emotion, the expression of Florence's
                  countenance changed.</p>
               <p>"Brother!" she exclaimed. "Let me think one moment. Marcus Warland! Can he be the
                  fiend who has thus cruelly, pitilessly cut me right through the heart? This cannot
                  be his handwriting. Brother, he never wrote it. I know he never did. How could I
                  believe him guilty of such a coward blow? God forgive my injustice. Oh! I have
                  greatly wronged him; I know, I feel I have."</p>
               <p>Her countenance lighted up gloriously as she spoke.</p>
               <p>"Florence, I do believe you are right. Warland <emph>is</emph> incapable of this
                  baseness. When I think of the years we have passed together, during which his
                  character grew brighter and purer, I feel, with you, the impossibility of his
                  having committed an act like this. We have the power to vindicate him. Where are
                  his letters? Let us compare the handwriting, word with word, letter with letter.
                  If it be forgery, I can detect it at once."</p>
               <p>With an eager hand, Florence opened her precious rosewood cabinet, and drew forth
                  the packet, bound with a cerulean ribbon. She shivered as she handed it to him,
                  and her touch was like contact with ice.</p>
               <p>"Wait one moment, brother," she cried; "this is an awful moment. Leave me still in
                  doubt. Doubt! how I despise myself for the word. My faith in him shall not
                  waver."</p>
               <p>Delaval, impatiently snatching a letter from the parcel, unfolded it by the side
                  of the crumpled paper he held in his hand, and carefully compared them, <emph>word
                     with word, letter with letter.</emph> Florence leaned over his shoulder,
                  bending her head lower and lower, her lately illumined countenance growing darker
                  and darker, as the irresistible conviction forced itself upon her, that they were
                  written by the same hand. Delaval raised his eyes one moment to hers, and she read
                  the same conviction in that stern, yet burning glance.</p>
               <p>"No, this is no forgery," he cried. "The circumstances to which this letter refers
                  are known only to him, Patterson, and myself. Even if the characters did not prove
                  it with such damning fidelity, the contents would be sufficient. I knew that he
                  was to address him on this very subject. Here are the very words I myself uttered
                  the last time I conversed with him. I never breathed them to another human being.
                  I requested him to repeat the same to Patterson. Yes; these are my own words, and
                  this <emph>is</emph> his own handwriting. And, look, Florence, the selfsame paper,
                  too, with his ciphers stamped upon it. He got it at the North. We visited the
                  paper-mill together where it was made, and both of us ordered some with our
                  initials pressed on the corner of the sheet. Florence, he <emph>is</emph> a
                  villain. Every shadow of a doubt is swept away. He is a most consummate
                  villain."</p>
               <p>"No," she replied, with bloodless lips, "I recall my own rash words. He has
                  revealed his naked heart to another, not to me. I, I have done the whole. I have
                  outraged his delicacy, alienated his affection, and with my own hand murdered his
                  love. And yet," she added, with a kindling countenance, "how dare he attempt to
                  transfer me to another? How dare he insult me so coldly, so deliberately? This I
                  never, never can forgive."</p>
               <p>While Florence was speaking, the truth of what she had previously said came
                  forcibly into the mind of Delaval. This<pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC6692-00000110"/>
                  was a private letter, not intended for their perusal; it was the expression of one
                  man's feelings to another; the liberty of mind, the republicanism of thought. By a
                  public act of vengeance, he would only blazon the affair to the world, and make
                  his sister's name a byword, to be banded from lip to lip with mockery and
                  reproach. Blood would not efface the impression. It would only give it a more
                  hideous glare.</p>
               <p>"Yes," muttered he to himself, "she is right. There are some wrongs that cannot be
                  avenged, and this is one. It is no wonder he looks down upon us, when we have
                  worshipped him as if he were some eastern divinity. Heavens, Florence!" he
                  exclaimed, walking backward and forward, like a caged lion, "I would give Wood
                  Lawn, and all the lawns in creation, if I owned them, that I had never abetted you
                  in your wild frolic of writing those foolish letters, and still more do I mourn
                  your infatuation in assuming that romantic and unheard-of disguise. I ought to be
                  shot this moment, for not proving a better guardian to your reckless youth. We
                  have made him arrogant and presumptuous; we have forgotten our own
                  self-respect."</p>
               <p>"Do not say <emph>we,</emph> George," said Florence, in a tone of deep and
                  touching humility. "Mine alone is the folly, and mine alone be the punishment.
                  Most bitterly have I repented of my girlish forwardness; but I was a mere child
                  then, a creature of impulse and passion. Alas! I am still the same; the same
                  impulsive, impassioned being, untaught by experience, and undisciplined by
                  reason."</p>
               <p>"Experience!" cried Delaval, with bitterness. "Moralists boast of the great
                  world,—master experience,—but I never could discover his merits. He warns us of
                  the past, but we know that already. His lamp throws all its rays backward. I want
                  a guide for the future; and such a future? Shade of Cicero!"</p>
               <p>Delaval threw himself on the window-seat, and endeavoured to compose his thoughts
                  and deliberate on the course he must adopt. The only way was for Florence to
                  return the letters of Marcus, with every memorial of his false love, with a
                  haughty and positive rejection, without any allusion to the disgraceful letter
                  which had providentially revealed his true character. But Katy; sweet, modest,
                  gentle, loving Katy! How could he tear her from his heart,—that warm, noble,
                  generous heart, where she was so sacredly enshrined? The sister of that false,
                  rejected brother would never consent to be his wife. His letters would be
                  returned, just as that perfumed blue-bound packet was about to be; the rings with
                  which he had encircled her fair fingers, the bracelets he had clasped round her
                  snowy arms,—they would all come back, mocking him with the memory of his past
                  happiness, the thought of his brightest hopes. Wood Lawn would henceforth be a
                  desert to him, the whole world a wilderness. He had a strong mind to shoot
                  himself, he had not promised Florence not to do that. He could do it without
                  perjury, but not without guilt,—guilt "unhouselled, unanointed, unannealed;" so
                  God's voice within, <emph>still, small,</emph> but deep, whispered, and he groaned
                  at the thought of the cold, dreary, unloving life he was doomed to lead.</p>
               <p>"You are unhappy, brother; I have made you so," said Florence, taking his hand in
                  both hers, and laying her cheek gently upon it. "You must not give up Katy for me.
                     <emph>She</emph> is not to blame; <emph>I</emph> only am. Rash, imprudent girl
                  that I am. I have brought this on myself. I feel it now, when it is too late."</p>
               <p>Delaval drew her closer to him. She had been rash and imprudent. He had told her
                  that before; but he could not reproach her now. He felt too deep a tenderness, too
                  entire a love, too intense a compassion. They sat thus in silence—she weary and
                  exhausted by her passion and her tears, thankful, in her abandonment and
                  desolation, that one friend was left to sympathize with and care for her, one
                  breast on which she could pillow her aching head and solace her wounded heart.</p>
               <p>"You had better go to your room, Florence," said he, gathering up her dishevelled
                  hair and smoothing it back from her shoulders. "Some one might come in. Go and lie
                  down. Your head must ache. I need not caution you not to reveal the cause of your
                  agitation. You have too much pride to betray it."</p>
               <pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC6692-00000111"/>
               <p>"Thank you for the warning; I will profit by it," said she, with a sudden flash of
                  spirit, "and thank you for your tenderness, your sympathy, and your promise
                  too—dear, dear George—oh! how I love you for it! I have no one else in the world
                  to love but you, now—for I cared but for one besides," she added, in a low voice,
                  as she left the apartment.</p>
               <p>Alone in her own room, she threw herself on the bed, and drawing the fringed
                  curtains closely round her, wrapped herself in darkness as with a mantle. She knew
                  not when night came on, for Delaval had told Letty not to have her disturbed, as
                  she was ill, and wanted no supper. Mrs. Lewis was absent on a visit to a friend—a
                  fortunate circumstance for Florence and the mystery of her grief.</p>
               <p>"Is that you, Letty?" asked she, hearing footsteps entering, and perceiving the
                  glimmer of a light through the curtains.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Miss Florence, it's me. Shall I bring your supper?"</p>
               <p>"No; come here, Letty." The negro put down the light, and came softly toward the
                  bed, peeping through the curtains.</p>
               <p>"Letty," said Florence, holding out her hand, "I spoke crossly to you. I did not
                  know what I was saying; you must forget it."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Miss Florence, don't say that. I no business to stick my ugly nose in your
                  matters, any way—that I haint. I wish I pull out my tongue, I do—saucy old
                  thing."</p>
               <p>"Undress me, Letty, and let me sleep. You don't know how sick I feel."</p>
               <p>Tenderly as if she were fondling an infant, Letty prepared her young mistress for
                  the night's repose, which she feared would not visit her pillow. She combed and
                  brushed her rich, tangled, tear-moistened locks, letting them drip over her black
                  fingers, in blacker, shining curls. There was nothing in the world in which she
                  delighted so much as this, and though her features were so large and coarse, she
                  had remarkably small and delicately-shaped fingers, and her touch was as light as
                  the fabulous Rosa's.</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said Florence, suffering her head to fall languidly guidly back on
                  the pillow. "That is soothing. You are a good creature, Letty. I will try never to
                  speak cross to you again. Don't say any thing."</p>
               <p>Letty placed the lamp in the chimney, where it could not shine on the face of her
                  young mistress, and seating herself at a distance, remained perfectly still.
                  Florence too was still. It was the torrent's smoothness, after it has dashed over
                  the rocks—the lull of the tempest, when its fury has spent.</p>
               <p>She slept—but it was not rest. Every now and then she would start up, with a faint
                  scream, look wildly round her, close her eyes and fall back again. Once she cried
                  out, "The letter—oh! Marcus—that letter!"</p>
               <p>Letty sat in her shaded corner, and "pondered these things in her heart."</p>
               <p>Florence rose at the usual hour, and suffered Letty to linger with unusual care
                  over her toilette. Though her head throbbed almost to bursting, she allowed her
                  tire-woman to twist the wild undulation of her tresses around her fingers, as she
                  was wont to do. When she looked in the glass and saw her pallid cheek and altered
                  countenance, she blushed, indignant at her own weakness, and the life came back to
                  her cheek and eye. Delaval met her at the door of the breakfast-room with a
                  brotherly kiss. He was rejoiced to see her looking so much like herself, and his
                  own stern, joyless countenance brightened as he gazed upon her. But after the
                  first greeting was over, and she believed herself unnoticed, he remarked the
                  gradual subsiding of her spirit. The colour all went away from her cheek, and she
                  sat with weeping lashes, that threw a deeper pallor on her pensive face.</p>
               <p>"Come and take a ride on horseback with me, sister," said he, when the breakfast
                  was through, which she scarcely touched. "I want to show you what wonders I have
                  done on the plantation since I have taken the reins in my own hand. That fine
                  jaunt I had with Arnold's negroes was an excellent apprenticeship for me. They
                  thought I was a jewel of a master."</p>
               <p>Florence appreciated her brother's motive, and gladly ac<pb n="224-225"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000112"/> companied him. She wanted to get away from herself.
                  She would have gone to the world's end, if she could have reached it. It was
                  astonishing how her life came back to her, when she went out into the open air on
                  a light-footed pony. The haughty spirit that sustained her of yore returned to its
                  former dwelling-place in her bosom. She would not weep, and sigh, and pine, for an
                  ingrate, unworthy of woman's generous, uncalculating, self-forgetting love. She
                  would rend him from her heart, though half of the quivering member were torn away,
                  with the image it enshrined. She would drink of the cold waters of Lethe, and find
                  a blessed nepenthe for a wounded spirit. Thus she resolved, and thus, in the
                  presence of others, she appeared to feel and act; but when alone, she lived over
                  again the fleet, blissful dream of the past, and nature vindicated its rights.
                  Then, her mighty, unconquerable love soared above the remembrance of ingratitude,
                  scorn, and contempt. It was a love like that which mourns for the dead; for he
                  whom she loved no longer existed. A bright ideal, it had vanished, and left a
                  vacuum the whole world could not fill. <q>

               <p>She had one task to perform which she dreaded, but would not defer. To gather all
                  the mementoes of her ill-directed attachment; to return his letters and pledges of
                  love; to destroy the faded flowers she had been treasuring as holy relics. She
                  took from her finger a ruby ring, the token of his plighted faith, and drew
                  through it the golden chain which he had passed round the neck of Rosa. The ruby
                  was her favourite gem. Its glowing hue heightened the dark splendour of her
                  beauty, and was an appropriate emblem of love. Now, as she looked for the last
                  time on a pledge she had thought would remain on her finger, even under the dark
                  coffin-lid, it seemed to emit a bleeding radiance, and she could almost fancy it
                  owed its crimson tint to drops of blood. The letters she would not read, lest a
                  re-perusal of pages so fraught with fascination should soften her purpose, and
                  unfit her for the stern duty before her. Her task was finished; the few decisive
                  words written; the packet sealed, directed, and ready to be sent. Then she sat
                  down, and shuddered at the blank before her. A Peruvian worshipper, who beheld the
                  god whom he adored abdicate his mid-day throne, and leave to darkness the regency
                  of the universe, could hardly feel more appalled and chilled by the desolation of
                  his temple; more sad for its departed glory.</p>
               <p>The more she reflected, the more she blamed herself, and exculpated him. She had
                  shocked, disgusted him, by the greatness of her love. From the time when, a wild,
                  impulsive girl, she had met him by the wayside fountain, and felt that strong,
                  irresistible attraction which modern philosophy vainly attempts to explain, and
                  addressed to him those anonymous letters, to the moment the paper destined to
                  reveal herself to herself in a true light fell at her feet, that love had been
                  growing stronger, deeper, fuller. It was too strong, too deep for the narrow
                  channel in which custom had forced it. It had dashed over some conventional
                  restraints, some ancient landmarks, and flowed on in the strength and joy of its
                  waves.</p>
               <p>Why, when she heard that he was wounded and dying, a stranger in a strange place,
                  did she not do as others of a colder temperament would have done, content herself
                  by shedding a few unavailing tears, and wishing she were privileged to minister to
                  his sufferings? Why, disguising the heiress under the form of an humble mulatto,
                  protected only by the faithful Letty, had she pressed on through unknown
                  difficulties to be with him in sickness and danger, perhaps in death? Her
                  self-devotion, her matchless love, how had it been repaid? With scorn and
                  loathing, that neither gratitude nor former love could triumph over. She had
                  believed her disguise impenetrable—her secret unrevealed. But Marcus had
                  penetrated the one, and revealed the other.</p>
               <p>She must endure the shame, and bear the cross she had laid upon herself. She must

                  out its crown. She would walk the lonely path she had herself strewed with thorns;
                  and though her feet might bleed, and her spirit faint from pain and weariness, she
                  would not murmur, but trust, that chastened by suffering, she might at last reach
                  some quiet spot— <q>

               <p>But Letty, though stretched on her pallet, which was spread every night in the

               <p>Florence caught a glimpse of one of her big, revolving eyes, above the bed-cover,
                  and extinguished the lamp. Still the negro gazed on her starlit profile, and
                  continued her musings. She was trying to solve an enigma, and had any one asked
                  her by what mental process she arrived at certain conclusions, she would have
                  answered, like a mathematical prodigy of her own colour, "I just studies it

               <p>IF almost unexampled success could produce elation and vainglory, Marcus Warland
                  was in danger of inordinate self-esteem. Circumstances had favoured in a
                  remarkable manner his opening career. Theft, forgery, and murder seemed to have
                  made the scene of his labours their head-quarters, so that the young champion of
                  the majesty of the law might test the keenness and strength of the weapons with
                  which he armed himself for its defence. He had that open-sesame to the caverns of
                  mind; that golden key to the chambers of the heart; cloquence, native eloquence,
                  the gift of God, not man.</p>
               <p>"His was the glorious burst of winged words," that bear on their rush the
                  listening throng. His was the burning glance, that, like a living coal from the
                  altar, kindled the spirits of his listeners, and his the persuasive lip that
                  distilled the honey of Hybla's scented fields. He knew his power, and was
                  conscious that the time was fast approaching when he could offer to Florence a
                  name of which even her proud uncle would be proud.</p>
               <p>He was at this time engaged in a most interesting trial. A youth of about
                  seventeen was accused of the murder of a young female, on circumstantial evidence.
                  He had a widowed mother, and he was her only son. At the time of the arrest, when
                  he was literally dragged to prison, for he resisted with indescribable terror the
                  power that had grasped him, his agonized glance, sweeping over the crowd that
                  gathered in the street, was fixed by the magnetic eye of Marcus, and stretching
                  out his arms toward him, he implored him for the love of God to have mercy on him,
                  and save him from the scaffold. Notwithstanding the darkness of the case, and the
                  strength of evidence against him, and the practice of criminals to endeavour to
                  screen their guilt under vehement assertions of innocence, Marcus believed in the
                  possibility of his being stainless of this foul crime. His compassion was excited
                  by the grief of the widowed mother, and the strong affection existing between her
                  and her imprisoned son. "We are poor and lonely," cried the weeping woman. "There
                  will be no one to plead in his behalf. My Willie will be sacrificed, for justice,
                  alas! must be bought."</p>
               <p>"I will undertake his defence," said Marcus, "and if he be innocent, may Heaven
                  assist me to prove it. If guilty, may God have mercy on his soul."</p>
               <p>Having once pledged his word, he laboured as assiduously to make himself master of
                  the circumstances, as if millions<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC6692-00000114"/> were
                  to be his reward. He spared neither time, nor expense, nor feeling. He mingled
                  with the dross of the populace, that he might extract the gold of truth.</p>
               <p>It was while seated, one afternoon, in his office, trying to clench some fact
                  which would bear strongly on the case, a large packet was brought to him.</p>
               <p>"From whom?"</p>
               <p>It was not known. The messenger was gone, without waiting for a reply. He
                  recognised the handwriting of Delaval on the covering, and hastily broke the
                  numerous seals by which it was secured. There was an inner covering, but between
                  that and the outer envelope was a note, superscribed by the hand of Florence,
                  which he eagerly unfolded. It contained but these few lines:</p>

               </q>
               <p>He read this brief, but explicit, note several times before he opened the second
                  envelope. He felt every word burning in the central fires of his heart. His hands
                  were cold, his face colourless, but without a single exclamation he tore away the
                  covering from his letters, and the golden chain, the locket with the golden hair,
                  and the ruby ring, fell at his feet. He took up the chain, and recognised his
                  parting gift to the gentle Rosa. He was bewildered, amazed. How came it in the
                  possession of Florence? The identity of Florence with the young mulatto had never
                  entered his mind before, and it is not strange that it did not occur to him at
                  this moment. But there was a thought, a flashing one, that seemed to throw light
                  on the inexplicable insult he had just received. Florence, by some means, had come
                  in contact with Rosa, and learned the history of this token of gratitude, so poor,
                  so small, for a devotion so entire, a debt so large. She had taken it from her,
                  that she might send it to him, as an explanation of her renunciation of him. Yes!
                  it was evident that the proud, high-souled Florence was jealous of the poor, too
                  sensitive mulatto, who had humbly craved a lock of his hair, that hair which she
                  had so often smoothed with her soft hand, when it lay moistened with the dew of
                  suffering. The heiress of Wood Lawn considered it a violation of her rights, and
                  she had discarded the lover whose gratitude to a menial resembled the
                  demonstration of love. The mystery was thus explained: but how had the mighty
                  fallen; how had the fine gold become dim! Florence suspected him of the basest
                  treachery; the most degrading inconsistency;—suspected <emph>him,</emph> Marcus
                  Warland—him whom she knew so well. The pallor of his face became suffused with
                  deepening crimson; his icy fingers tingled with a burning sensation. Too nobly
                  self-reliant himself to admit of the existence of jealousy, he could not tolerate
                  its dominion over another—and that other one whom he believed lifted high above
                  the little foibles of her sex. He sat down, and leaning his head on his hands,
                  tried to think calmly of the rashness and injustice of which Florence had been
                  guilty, and his meditations terminated in a feeling of tenderness and compassion
                  for her strange delusion. His idol had fallen from the pedestal of perfection on
                  which he had elevated her, but she was his idol still. He had worshipped her as an
                  angel, but she was after all only a woman—full of woman's impassioned emotions,
                  and liable to all a woman's weaknesses. He blamed, he pitied, but he loved her
                  still. A few words of explanation from his pen would dissipate the error, and
                  restore her lost confidence. With a lofty consciousness of his own unwavering
                  constancy, and a generous forgiveness of the rash impulse, for which he doubted
                  not she was even now upbraiding herself, he took his pen and wrote as they only
                  write who, as a beautiful writer has observed, "dip their pen in their own
                  hearts." He gave a brief history of his obligations to Rosa, and the circumstances
                  under which he gave her the token she had so mysteriously obtained. He dwelt on
                  the beautiful and holy confidence of their past intercourse; the purity and depth
                     of<pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC6692-00000115"/> their love; and besought her to
                  beware of the influence of that serpent passion, which poisoneth like an asp, and
                  stingeth like an adder. After a simple statement of facts, and an eloquent appeal
                  to her truth and sensibility, he asked her if she adhered to her renunciation and
                  repeated her demands. The letter was written, sealed, put in the mail, and Marcus
                  tried to forget it, and give his sole attention to the human life that hung on the
                  result of his investigations. He locked the packet and the locket in his cabinet,
                  that he might not be reminded of the weakness of L'éclair. He saw the ruby ring
                  sparkling on the floor, and stooping down and picking it up, he placed that also
                  with the offending chain. As he did so, his eye fell on the ruby gem which Mrs.
                  Bellamy had put on his finger when he was about to be exposed to the temptations
                  of a college life. He went back still further, and thought of the moment when she
                  had kissed his brow in the little cabin on the banks of the Chattahoochee. From
                  that moment to the present hour, her love, which had known no variableness nor
                  change, had been around and about him as a shield and a charm.</p>
               <p>"No voluntary act of mine," thought the young man, raising the sacred talisman to
                  his lips, "has ever paled the lustre of this glowing gem, or caused the blush of
                  shame on the cheek of my beloved benefactress. Oh! misguided L'éclair! I could
                  mourn in dust and ashes over thy broken trust and my own vanished dream of
                  perfection."</p>
               <p>During the days that must intervene before he could receive an answer to his
                  letter, he laboured for his poor young client with increasing zeal. He rode fifty
                  miles for a witness, whose testimony would have weight at the trial. He visited
                  the accused in his grated cell, determined, as he had embraced his cause, to
                  believe him innocent till he was proved guilty beyond the shadow of a doubt. He
                  went to the broken-hearted widow, and breathed into her fainting spirit comfort
                  and resignation. Poor and insignificant seemed his own sorrow compared to the
                  mighty interests they had at stake.</p>
               <p>The very morning of the trial, the letter arrived. With an agitated hand he broke
                  the seal. His own unopened letter dropped from the envelope—his own heart thrown
                  back into his face! Never had the countenance of Marcus worn such an expression
                  before. Never but <emph>once</emph> had such a whirlwind of passion raged in his
                  bosom; and that was when the black-bearded speculator raised his whip over his
                  head, while he was defending Milly from his lawless clutches. Tearing the letter
                  into a thousand pieces, he threw the fragments from the window to the four winds
                  of heaven, and exclaimed, "Thus do I rend from my bosom every trace of my
                  boyhood's folly and youth's delusion! Thus do I shatter the image too wildly
                  worshipped! Truth, justice, humanity, I am henceforth yours. To you I devote the
                  strength of my manhood, my powers of mind, body and soul. On your sacred altars I
                  pour the oblation of my heart's-blood, I lay the offering of my crucified
                  affections. O thou God of truth!" continued he, as the responsibilities of the
                  hour rolled back upon his memory, "let not my faculties, at this awful moment, be
                  darkened by the clouds of passion. Let them be clear, and strong, and
                  irresistible, that innocence may come forth uninjured from the lion's den of
                  oppression, and the majesty of a sin-avenging law be sustained in the sight of God
                  and man."</p>
               <p>Under the influence of the most powerful excitement, Marcus entered the court. It
                  was already crowded, for the case was one which awakened the deepest interest in
                  the whole community. The youth, sex, and personal qualities of the murdered
                  female, the extreme youth, interesting appearance, and previously unspotted
                  reputation of the accused, the poor, widowed mother, and the brilliant reputation
                  of Marcus, whose services were known to be gratuitous, all created an eager
                  interest in the trial, and a desire to witness its process. The prisoner, whose
                  name was Willie Dale, was brought in, and led to the customary seat. He was a
                  slender youth, with an extremely juvenile countenance, whose pale complexion was
                  contrasted by the dark, smooth hair parted on his fair forehead. Fair even to
                  feminine delicacy was his young face.<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6692-00000116"/>
                  How nicely, how carefully was he dressed!—with his snowy-white collar turned back
                  from his neck, and a black ribbon passing underneath, and tied in a loose,
                  graceful knot in front! His mother's hand has arranged those shining locks, which
                  had acquired a rank luxuriance in his close, damp cell. He looked like a victim
                  adorned for sacrifice; and there, in a corner of the room, sat the mother, who,
                  with maternal pride struggling with her despair, had adorned her darling, hoping
                  to soften the stern and iron justice of the law by those juvenile attractions so
                  irresistible in her own estimation. She sat straining her swollen and bloodshot
                  eyes on the face of her boy, as if it were even then to be shut out from her sight
                  for ever. The hopes which she had nourished in her bosom went out in the close air
                  she now breathed, and at the sight of that dark-looking throng. There was
                  something too in the face of Marcus, usually so hope-inspiring, that filled her
                  with dread. His cheeks were flushed, his eye had a burning, restless glance, and
                  there was a sternness on his brow she had never seen before. He must have arrived
                  at the conviction that his cause was hopeless. She read in his altered countenance
                  the death-warrant of her son. Willie too, who had been accustomed to find
                  encouragement from the beaming eyes of Marcus, now, after shrinking back from the
                  curious gaze of the many, the compassionate glances of the few, turned toward him,
                  pale and trembling, ready to sink with new and vague alarm. Marcus met that look
                  of pale despair, and upbraiding himself for his momentary oblivion of him in his
                  self-absorption, smiled on the heart-sick boy, and raised his hand, as if
                  directing him to seek support from on high. That smile seemed to the accused a
                  glimpse of the opening heavens. With a sickly reflection of its lustre on his
                  wasted features, he bent his head, and large drops, gliding downward, dropped on
                  his white collar.</p>
               <p>The story of the murder and the circumstances of the arrest were these: Fanny
                  Bird, a very pretty and interesting orphan girl, was apprenticed to a mantuamaker,
                  by whom the Widow Dale, the mother of Willie, was also employed, in plain
                  needle-work. Mrs. Dale lived in the suburbs of the town, and Fanny was frequently
                  indulged, at the approach of night, in carrying the work to the widow, and taking
                  back that which was completed. It was a recreation to the young girl, after being
                  confined all day to the needle, and her spirits, naturally elastic, generally rose
                  high, during these twilight walks, especially when young Willie Dale was her
                  companion. Willie was what is called a Printer's devil, though in appearance he
                  bore a much greater resemblance to the children of light than of darkness. The
                  evening of the murder Fanny was seen tripping gayly along, with a bright scarlet
                  shawl thrown coquettishly over one shoulder—(Fanny was fond of dress, and whatever
                  she wore seemed to adorn her with peculiar grace)—and a bundle of white linen in
                  her hands. She walked through the central part of the town, and down a narrow
                  alley that led to the more unfrequented portion of it. She had to pass a thicket
                  of pines, with an undergrowth of young oaks, before reaching the dwelling of Mrs.
                  Dale. It was at the entrance of this thicket Willie usually met her, and
                  accompanied her to his mother's. She was seen standing and talking with him just
                  on the edge of the young wood about sundown, conspicuous from her red shawl and
                  snowy-white bundle, among the deep, green shades. They seemed to be disputing
                  about something, and he tried to take something from her hand, which she resisted.
                  About a half-hour afterwards, the same gentleman who had observed them standing
                  under the tall pine trees, in returning into town, was startled by a shrill,
                  piercing cry, as of one in mortal agony, which seemed to proceed from the very
                  heart of the thicket. He plunged into its shades, and right on the brink of a
                  small runnel he beheld, through the thickening shades of twilight, the lifeless
                  and bleeding body of the young girl, and kneeling by her side, holding in his hand
                  a dripping knife, a knife dripping with her blood, was the boy. The scarlet shawl
                  was gone—the linen roll scattered on the ground. The first act of the gentleman
                  was to arrest the boy, thus detected, as it were, in the<pb n="234-235"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000117"/> very act of murder. In vain Willie, with frantic
                  shrieks, protested his innocence. The bloody knife found in his hand he had
                  purchased that very afternoon, at a well-known store. This fact was proved by
                  attesting witnesses, and it was sufficient to seal his condemnation. It is no
                  wonder that an event so tragic, a murder that seemed so motiveless, should have
                  caused a terrible sensation. It is no wonder that people gathered at the corner of
                  the streets, in the shops and public houses, and talked, and marvelled as they
                  talked. Sweet Fanny Bird was the favourite of the community, and so strong and
                  swelling was the public indignation against Willie, that had he not been shielded
                  by the influence of Marcus, there was danger of his being <emph>lynched</emph> by
                  an excited mob.</p>
               <p>As we said before, the hall of the court-house was crowded, and still the crowd
                  continued to increase. A large portion of the audience consisted of the gentler
                  sex, who pleaded their interest in the youthful criminal as an excuse for
                  attending a scene where Marcus Warland was to display his unrivalled
                  eloquence.</p>
               <p>It is unnecessary to go through all the minutiæ of a trial. Let it be supposed,
                  that the presiding judge has taken his august position, that the jury, in
                  duodecimal dignity, are ranged before him, and that the state-solicitor and
                  counsel for the prisoner have their appropriate locations. When the oath was
                  administered to the accused, and pressing his pallid lips to the sacred volume,
                  Willie raised his eyes to heaven, and declared with a clear, firm voice, that he
                  was <emph>not guilty,</emph> a low, sobbing <emph>amen</emph> was heard in the
                  corner where his mother sat.</p>
               <p>The evidence against the prisoner has been already stated. The chief witnesses
                  were the shop-keeper of whom he had purchased the knife, and the gentleman who had
                  made the discovery of the murdered body, over which he was holding the reeking
                  weapon. He, the last named, was a plain, downright honest man, whose testimony was
                  clear and impressive, and seemed not to leave the faintest doubt of the guilt of
                  the pale boy, who looked as if he were praying for the mountains to cover him from
                  the gaze of man. And well he might pray, for though the face of Marcus had
                  recovered its usual serenity, it was but one beam of sunshine mid the black cloud
                  of evidence closing around him. The people looked toward Marcus, wondering at his
                  calmness, when he had risked his new-born reputation in so hopeless a cause. They
                  admired his disinterestedness and magnanimity, but wished they had been called
                  forth by a nobler object. The feelings of compassion that the juvenile appearance
                  and sad and innocent-looking countenance of Willie had awakened were transferred
                  to the fair, young orphan, whose bosom his knife had pierced, whose blood had
                  given a darker tinge to the gurgling rill.</p>
               <p>The witnesses whom Marcus summoned testified to the irreproachable character of
                  Willie, as well as the industry and piety of his mother. They also bore testimony
                  to the strong affection he had always manifested for the murdered girl. But no
                  evidence was brought forward to neutralize the facts that glared before the eye of
                  the public. His previous innocence and virtue only made his crime more hideous and
                  appalling by force of contrast. It was blood on a snowy surface, looking more red,
                  more deadly from the surrounding whiteness. Making a sign to a gentleman who was
                  near him, and who immediately left the court, Marcus rose, and every eye was
                  turned upon him.</p>
               <p>"I perceive, gentlemen of the jury," said he, addressing them with a serious,
                  earnest, and respectful manner, "that there is but one impression in regard to the
                  guilt of the prisoner. As far as human judgment is concerned, his doom is sealed.
                  On your solemn brows I read the sternness, the inflexibility of justice, not the
                  softness of compassion, the relenting of prejudice. Nothing has been brought
                  forward in his defence but the evidence of a spotless life, a life passed in acts
                  of gentleness and kindness, filial devotion, obedience, and love. A boy in the
                  early bloom and springtime of his life, who has walked in your midst in the paths
                  of purity and peace, who has never even been known to yield to those passions
                  which usually swel.<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC6692-00000118"/> high in the
                  youthful bosom, stands before you accused of one of the most awful and unexampled
                  crimes that ever blackened the annals of human guilt. He stands before you in the
                  innocence and beauty of youth, meek, and unmurmuring, bowed down by the weight of
                  the terrible accusation, which might well crush a giant's strength. You have heard
                  the evidence against him. As I said before, <emph>he</emph> has nothing to oppose
                  to it but a blameless life, a life pure from the faintest tinge of evil, whose
                  every act belies the damning accusation. The atrocious crime of having purchased a
                  knife has been proved by attesting witnesses. Every other boy of his age in town
                  is possessor of a similar weapon. Unfortunately, in this southern portion of our
                  land it is considered a necessary badge of manhood, and not three days previous to
                  this awful tragedy, my client was mocked by some of his juvenile companions for
                  being destitute of this heroic distinction. Wounded by an insult that he was too
                  gentle to resent, in an evil hour he purchased the accursed steel, which, by a
                  fatal coincidence of circumstances, was to prove his own destruction. With the
                  glittering instrument in his bosom, whose innocent pulsations never before had
                  pressed against aught so cold and deadly, he went out in the soft and balmy
                  twilight to meet the young girl, who came toward his mother's dwelling, like a
                  morning sunbeam gilding the evening's shade. They met as usual beneath the lofty
                  pines, in the holy hush of Nature's resting time, with every sweet and gracious
                  influence coming into their hearts, with the silent dew and the whispering gale.
                  With the artless exultation of boyhood he exhibited his new-bought treasure, which
                  the young girl playfully snatched from his hand. She admired its gilded sheath and
                  trenchant blade, but she refused to return it, declaring it was too keen, too
                  dangerous a weapon for a hand so gentle and so young. Hiding it beneath the folds
                  of a scarlet shawl, of gauze-like texture, but brilliant dye, she threatened to
                  carry it to his mother, that poor widowed mother, whose sobs are even now
                  distinctly audible. He had an errand which called him to the nearest grocer, and
                  telling his young companion panion to wait for him in the thicket, and if any one
                  assaulted her, to defend herself with the weapon she had purloined. With a bright
                  smile and rapid step, he turned away to execute his filial commission. Once again
                  he looked back, drawn by an irresistible impulse, to catch one more glimpse of the
                  fair young girl, the morning-star of his boyish hopes and affection. As he saw the
                  flutter of her scarlet drapery through the dark foliage, it was strange, but a
                  sudden chilling thought of blood came into his mind. He wished she had not worn
                  that gorgeous mantle. He shuddered when he remembered the smiling grace with which
                  she had screened the knife within its bosom folds. He was detained longer than he
                  anticipated, and hurried back to the appointed place of meeting. God of the
                  innocent!" exclaimed Marcus, recoiling as if he beheld the spectacle he was
                  describing. "What a sight met the eyes of that fond, loving boy! By the side of a
                  brooklet that gurgles through the thicket lay the youthful maiden, the life-blood
                  gushing from her breast, and giving a gory tinge to the blue waters murmuring
                  near. His own knife dripping with blood was on the ground, where a dark pool was
                  already formed. With a loud, piercing shriek of agony, the boy threw himself at
                  her side, and lifting the blood-stained weapon, wildly pressed it to his pale and
                  quivering lips. At that heart-rending cry, the apparently lifeless girl opened for
                  one moment her glazing eyes, and fixed them on the face of the young lover, who
                  would have died a thousand times over to redeem her from death. 'Oh, Fanny,
                  Fanny!' exclaimed the soul-stricken boy, 'would to God I had died for thee!'"</p>
               <p>Here the loud sobs of Willie interrupted the agitated voice of Marcus, and many an
                  echo was heard in different parts of the hall. The tide of sympathy and compassion
                  was now swelling and rolling toward the accused, for Marcus was swaying the hearts
                  of his listeners, and bearing them on with him as with the strength of a mighty
                  wind.</p>
               <p>"And now, most honoured gentlemen," continued the pleader, "I appeal to you, in
                  the name of nature and of nature's God,<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC6692-00000119"/>
                  and ask you if you can believe in the possibility of that boy's guilt. The moment
                  I saw him, when he stretched out his imploring arms, and entreated me to save him
                  from the scaffold's doom, I felt his innocence to my heart's core. Had an angel
                  come down from the skies, and proclaimed with trumpet-tongue his freedom from
                  crime, my conviction could hardly have been stronger and deeper. The statement I
                  have given you I received from him in his grated cell, the open Bible before him,
                  in the presence of his weeping mother and the great and invisible God. I believe
                  it, gentlemen. I believe every word of it, and so do you. I read it in your
                  altered glances; the softened expression of your grave and solemn countenances. I
                  see the dawn of Christian mercy on your stern brows. Some monster, concealed in
                  the shade of the thicket, murdered the lonely maiden, and robbed her of the
                  scarlet mantle that probably attracted his brutal eye. Strange how little stress
                  has been laid on the mysterious disappearance of that fatal shawl! a fact that
                  proves irrefragably that other hands than Willie's had been busy in the dread
                  transaction. I have never lost sight of this one moment since I enlisted in the
                  cause. It was by this I was resolved to prove the innocence of my client, and I
                     <emph>can</emph> do it. I wanted first to appeal to your understandings as men;
                  your consciences as Christians; your hearts as fathers, brothers, and sons. I
                  wanted you to have the joy and pride of feeling that you had acquitted him, even
                  before conviction was forced upon you, as it soon will be. For there may be a case
                  brought before this honourable judge and honourable jury when the decision will be
                  left to the judgment of man, unsupported by the facts I am enabled, thank God, to
                  bring forward. Deal gently, cautiously, gentlemen, with human life and human
                  feelings. Think of the dark hours this poor boy has passed in the prison gloom to
                  which he has been consigned. Think of the visions of the tightening cord; the
                  ignominious scaffold; the unhonoured grave; the blasted memory, that must have
                  haunted, like hideous spectres, his pallet of straw. Think of the anguish of a
                  widowed mother, whose prayers have been wearying Heaven day and night for justice.
                  Justice for her victim-boy! They can never be indemnified for these. Years may
                  roll on after years, and the shadow will linger over their hearts. Yea, when the
                  dark locks of that boy are whitened with the frost of age—if God grants him length
                  of days—dark memories of life will eclipse its noonday brightness; cold memories
                  will chill its warmth, and all beauty and gladness will pass away from earth. Oh!
                  it is a fearful thing for frail, fallible, erring man, to sit in judgment on his
                  brother man, and breathe the words which may cause unquenchable, undying remorse
                  through the unwasting ages of eternity."</p>
               <p>He paused, and so deep was the impression created by his address, it is more than
                  probable that Willie would have been acquitted had not most extraordinary proofs
                  of his innocence been produced.</p>
               <p>There was a bustle near the door, and the gentleman who had disappeared at a sign
                  from Marcus, re-entered, dragging, rather than leading, a figure, whose appearance
                  caused an instantaneous sensation in the whole court. Suppressed laughter and
                  murmurs of astonishment were heard, mingled with a slight scream from the ladies.
                  The sheriff called to "order." The judge passed his hand over his face before he
                  could restore it to its accustomed gravity of expression. The new-comer was indeed
                  a most extraordinary-looking person, such as perhaps was never before called into
                  a court of justice. It was a negro, well known in and about the town by the name
                  of <hi rend="i"/>Idiot Ben, one of those unfortunate beings whom the Almighty has
                  set apart from their kind, to show how poor and degraded is the human form without
                  the indwelling deity of mind. He was hideously ugly. His mouth, of tremendous
                  size, resembled a large drawer of an old-fashioned mahogany bureau, and out of
                  that drawer a tongue was for ever hanging, like a piece of thick, red flannel, for
                  it was of most surprising redness, presenting a physiological phenomenon by its
                  depth of hue. Hanging his head, lolling his tongue, and shuffling his feet,<pb
                     n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6692-00000120"/> Idiot Ben was dragged before the
                  astonished assembly, at the bidding of Marcus, whose countenance retained the same
                  serene and earnest gravity of expression it had worn the last half hour.</p>
               <p>The state solicitor objected to the admission of the negro into court. His colour
                  alone would prevent him from bearing witness; his idiocy from taking a binding
                  oath. He was astonished at the young gentleman for introducing so strong an
                  anomaly into the courts of justice.</p>
               <p>"I admit," said Marcus, "all the learned solicitor has advanced; but this man,
                  black and idiotic as he is, will make the innocence of the accused appear as clear
                  as the noonday sun. By the foolish things of this world God confoundeth the wisdom
                  of the wise. To talk of informality at a moment like this, when life, that
                  God-given life, which man should never lightly take away, hangs trembling on a
                  spider's thread, reminds me—pardon me, sir, for introducing the incident—of the
                  drowning gentleman, who, when about to be seized by the strong arms of the
                  deliverer, who was wrestling with the waves for his rescue, exclaimed, 'Excuse me,
                  sir, I have never had the honour of being introduced to you.'</p>
               <p>"I appeal to your honour," continued he, turning to the judge, with a dignity
                  which sat with wonderful grace and ease upon his youth; "I appeal to you, sir, in
                  the name of the living God, not to allow etiquette and formality to outweigh human
                  life and reputation in the scales of justice. I demand permission for this negro
                  to remain in court. I demand to be sworn as a witness myself, that I may testify
                  to facts which, if not revealed before this earthly tribunal, will rise up in
                  judgment against us on that day for which all other days were made."</p>
               <p>The judge, admitting the truth and strength of this appeal, bowed his head, and
                  Marcus, taking the solemn oath Idiot Ben was incapacitated from uttering, placed
                  himself by the witnesses who had been examined. As he passed near the negro, he
                  drew a red silk handkerchief from his bosom, and with apparent carelessness
                  suffered it to float in the air. Ben, darting out his tongue like a great black
                  serpent, leaped toward it, and grasped it with both hands.</p>
               <p>"Ben want it," he cried, trying to put it in his mouth; "Ben will have it."</p>
               <p>A loud murmur went through the hall. The excitement became intense. Marcus
                  suffered the handkerchief to remain in the grasp of the now grinning idiot, who
                  clutched it with maniac violence, rolling his eyes from one side to the other,
                  while he tried to conceal it from the gaze of the audience.</p>
               <p>"You have now witnessed," said Marcus, "what will furnish a clue to this dark
                  mystery. We may account for the idiosyncracy of Idiot Ben in some measure, by
                  observing the peculiar formation of his head and neck. It is well known that the
                  fierce bull is attracted by the hue of scarlet, and the rabid dog foams with more
                  demoniac frenzy at the sight of glowing red. What there is in this gorgeous colour
                  to inflame the passions of wild animals I cannot define, unless it is its
                  similitude to blood. But it is certain that the head of this unfortunate negro has
                  the same contour as the bull, and his neck is thick and swelling where it meets
                  the chin, like the terrible bloodhounds. From the moment I heard the circumstances
                  of the murder, a fact which seemed to have but little weight with others was a
                  subject to me of the deepest and most serious consideration. I was convinced that
                  the same hand which had shed the blood of the maiden had robbed her bleeding body
                  of the scarlet drapery which enfolded it. On this single point, I knew, hung the
                  life of my young client.</p>
               <p>"One evening, about the hour when the nightshades begin to fall, I was passing
                  through the central street, and found myself opposite the very store where the
                  prisoner purchased the fatal knife at such a costly price. The showy articles
                  which hang from the exterior of the door, to attract the vagrant eye, were still
                  fluttering in the breeze. Among them I noticed a scarf of brilliant scarlet, and
                  crouching near it was that dark, misshapen form. He touched the scarf, he even
                  lapped the bright silk with his huge red tongue. Perceiving<pb n="242-243"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000121"/> my eyes fixed steadfastly upon him, he skulked
                  away, like a poor hungry dog detected in stealing the bone he covets. I followed
                  him. I had seen this unfortunate and apparently harmless being before, sometimes
                  gazing at the sun with that vacant eye, vacant but strong and unblinking as the
                  eagle's, and sometimes prowling, like the forest beast, in the shadows of the
                  woods. 'Ben, do you love red?' I asked, when I had overtaken him. 'Ben loves red?'
                  he immediately answered, ''cause it pretty.' I happened to have in my pocket a
                  handkerchief of a deep crimson dye, resembling the one he is now grasping with
                  insane delight. I held it toward him, watching his countenance as I did so. Its
                  dull vacancy changed to animal rapacity. I retreated, holding the handkerchief
                  beyond his reach. He leaped up, endeavouring to clutch it, uttering wild and
                  unintelligible exclamations. At length I yielded it, and with a low chuckling
                  sound of exultation, he hid it in his bosom. 'What are you going to do with it?' I
                  inquired, feeling that I had found the clue to this Egyptian labyrinth of crime.
                  'Ben hide it, but Ben no tell where,' replied the idiot, looking at me with the
                  ferocious cunning of a wild beast. I questioned him respecting the hiding-place of
                  his treasures, but he only answered, with a thousand indescribable grimaces, 'Ben
                  no tell where.'</p>
               <p>"Sir, your honour," continued Marcus, with deepening earnestness, "you may be
                  assured that I did not give sleep to my eyes, nor slumber to my eyelids, till my
                  suspicions, or rather my belief was changed to conviction and certainty. Thank
                  heaven! it was a moonlight night, and the rays came down in silver showers on the
                  shades whose depths I sought. It was the thicket where the smoke of innocent blood
                  so lately went up to heaven, giving a deeper horror to the conscious wood. But I
                  saw not the form of the murdered maiden flitting by me in that pale, ghostly
                  lustre. I thought of the imprisoned boy, over whom the scaffold's doom was
                  impending. As the night-wind blew the boughs of the young oaks toward me, they
                  seemed to me the outstretching of his imploring arms. In the murmurs of the
                  blood-stained rill I heard his voice of patient agony. Every gray rock, that was
                  movable by the hand of man, I hurled from its ancient throne, in search of the
                  hiding-place of the idiot's treasures. Among those young oaks there is one
                  ancestral tree, which towers in patriarchal majesty above its verdant children. It
                  contains a hollow, round which the green leaves form an almost impervious veil,
                  and which, like New England's charter oak, might well be converted into a secret
                  cabinet. Lying at the foot of this tall elder of the forest, I beheld the Idiot
                  Ben, with his tongue of flame gleaming in the moonlight, though leaden slumbers
                  closed his eyes. In the leafy nest I have described, I discovered poor Fanny's
                  fatal shawl, with a piece of linen dabbled in blood, and wrapped around them my
                  own crimson handkerchief!" Here a sudden cry from Willie drew the eyes which were
                  gazing with intense excitement on Marcus toward the boy, whose innocence was now
                  manifest to all. His face was hueless, and he fell forward on an arm that was
                  involuntarily extended for his support. The mother tried to reach him, but she was
                  wedged in by the crowd, incapable of motion. Water was passed from hand to hand
                  till it could be applied to the fainting prisoner, fainting from the sudden
                  transition from despair to hope. While they were restoring Willie to
                  consciousness, the judge appointed several gentlemen to go to the thicket,
                  according to the directions of Marcus, and bring the articles concealed in the
                  hollow tree. In the mean time, Marcus resumed his testimony.</p>
               <p>"Your honour may not be aware that Idiot Ben has not long been a denizen of our
                  town. He came it is scarcely known when, whence nobody seemed to know. Begging
                  from day to day his crust of bread and morsel of meat, and sleeping at night with
                  the conies in the rock or the cattle in the field, no one has troubled himself
                  about his aimless, soulless existence. Obtaining from him some hint with regard to
                  his former place of residence, and following the indication, I have ascertained
                  that this is not the first time that his mysterious passion<pb n="244-245"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000122"/> sion for scarlet has led him on to deeds of blood
                  and violence. This gentleman can prove the truth of my assertion."</p>
               <p>The gentleman to whom Marcus referred was a witness he had summoned from the
                  county where Idiot Ben formerly resided. He stated that a few years before the
                  community of which he was a member was startled by a murder as singular and
                  apparently as motiveless as the one now under judicial examination. A little
                  child, who was dressed in a scarlet frock, was found bathed in blood, destitute of
                  her showy garment. The deepest mystery involved the transaction, till the little
                  red garment, stained with a yet deeper red, was discovered in the possession of
                  Ben, who was immediately arrested and imprisoned. Soon after his imprisonment,
                  several white men escaped from jail, and Ben must have fled at the same time.
                  Where he had been wandering no one knew. Nothing had been heard of the unfortunate
                  creature till the inquiries of Marcus concerning him recalled the remembrance of
                  the dreadful tragedy of which he had been the hero.</p>
               <p>The exhibition of the shawl and blood-stained linen was hardly necessary to
                  confirm the innocence of Willie; but when they were brought in court and unrolled
                  before the judge and jury, a noise went through the hall, like the dull roar of
                  the ocean. But when Marcus, with an irrepressible impulse, seized the scarlet
                  mantle and waved it like a victorious banner over his head, and Idiot Ben,
                  protruding his red serpent-tongue, shuffled forward, exclaiming, "That are
                  Ben's—Ben want it—Ben will have it," a loud, simultaneous shout burst forth from
                  the assembly, reverberating through the walls of the court-room, and rolling out
                  of doors and windows, proclaimed through the length and breadth of the street and
                  public square the innocence of Willie.</p>
               <p>It is unnecessary to proceed in the closing details of a trial which terminated in
                  the triumphant acquittal of the prisoner, and the imprisonment of poor Ben, not
                  for personal punishment, but public safety. The populace, in their enthusiasm,
                  would have borne Marcus on their shoulders from the hall, if he would have
                  permitted such an apotheosis; but, baffled in their attempt to deify the young
                  orator whose eloquence had excited them to momentary intoxication, they seized
                  hold of the weak and slender prisoner, and carried him aloft with deafening
                  acclamations. With his long, dark hair floating back from his white forehead, his
                  pale face lustrous with gratitude and joy, his hands and eyes uplifted to heaven,
                  in a kind of devout extasy, Willie was borne along beyond the limits of the
                  courtyard. The moment he was released, he flew to him who had saved him from an
                  ignominious death. With a heart too full for words, he caught his hands and
                  pressed them to his heart and his lips, and then, borne down by the weight of his
                  emotions, he sank at his feet weeping and sobbing, and wrapped his arms around his
                  knees. The widow, too, lifting her trembling hands to heaven, prayed the God of
                  the widow and the Father of the orphan to bless him for ever and ever. Marcus
                  passed his hand over his moistened eyes. Life could not be a wilderness, bedewed
                  by such heaven-born showers. A divine philanthropy warmed his soul. It was nobler
                  to live for the interests of mankind than for individual happiness. The boy, whose
                  life Providence had made him the honoured instrument of saving from a death of
                  shame, should henceforth be the object of his peculiar interest and care. The
                  pious and grateful widow should never know a want or sorrow that he could
                  avert.</p>
               <p>As soon as he could free himself from the almost oppressive congratulations of the
                  crowd, he sought the solitude of his room. There on his knees he blessed the God
                  of Innocence and Youth, the Great God of truth and justice, for having given him a
                  mind capable of benefiting his fellow-man, a heart open to the wants and
                  sufferings of oppressed humanity. He renewed the solemn dedication of himself to
                  the sacred Trio whose altar he had elevated on the ruins of Love. Then he took the
                  letters of Florence, the ring of betrothal, and every pledge of faith and
                  affection he had so carefully cherished, and sealing them in a packet, sent them
                  by express to Wood Lawn.</p>
               <pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC6692-00000123"/>
               <p>It seemed that all the elements which formed the being of Marcus were to pass
                  through the refiner's fire. About a week after the trial a letter from Katy
                  arrived, announcing the dangerous illness of their father. In less than an hour he
                  was on his way to Hickory Hill, over whose shades a shade deeper than the forest
                  gloom was now hovering.</p>

               <p>WHEN Marcus was about halfway on his sad and solitary journey, he met a very
                  elegant equipage, which was accompanied by a gentleman on horseback. So absorbed
                  was he by his meditations, he came upon them before he was aware of their
                  approach; but at one glance he recognised the coal-black eyes of Delaval, on whose
                  brow a cloud as black was resting. No sign of greeting was exchanged between the
                  two haughty equestrians. Marcus felt the darkness gathering over his own face.
                  Leaning back in the carriage, with listless languor, her arms folded in a lace
                  shawl, he had a glimpse of Florence. Raising her eyes dreamily, as the shadow of
                  the horseman fell on the carriage window, she beheld Marcus Warland, and a quick
                  vibration of light, cold and dazzling as the night-gleam of the aurora borealis,
                  passed over her features. They passed each other thus—they, whose hearts at their
                  last parting ing throbbed against each other with mutual pulsations, whose lips
                  exchanged the most sacred pledge of love and faith. How estranged, how altered
                  now! Could that pale, cold, icy-looking girl be the bright, impassioned
                  L'éclair?—that haughty, stormy-browed young man, the warm-hearted and impulsive
                  Delaval? Was he indeed Marcus Warland? and was he hastening to perhaps a dying
                  parent? This last interrogation subdued his rebellious thoughts. Death! the great
                  peacemaker—Death! the stern rebuker of passion. As its shadow glided on before
                  him, chill and mournful, all present interests were lost in its awful eclipse. A
                  few short years, and those resplendent eyes, whose altered glance had just now
                  filled him with such anguish and indignation, would be rayless and closed; those
                  once love-breathing, now disdainful lips, clay-cold and wan. Youth, beauty, and
                  love—what were they but a dream? What was life itself but a dream? the dream of a
                  feverish, troubled sleep, from which the soul would awake in the morning-light of
                  an eternal day? Continuing his journey through the night, Marcus rode on under a
                  midnight moon, his spirit bathed in its serene and solemn splendour. A thousand
                  times had he gazed on its unearthly beauty, and felt the dominant passion of the
                  hour glorified by its influence. A thousand times had the tide of his heart
                  swelled to overflowing, beneath its sweet, celestial attraction. Sometimes, when
                  he saw it riding at anchor on the azure waves of heaven, like a ship with silver
                  sails and majestic motion, he beheld an image of his own ambition, so lofty in its
                  destination, so unswerving in its course. Again, when it rose behind an argent
                  cloud, leaning softly over to gaze upon its image in some limpid wave that seemed
                  panting to receive it, he saw a type of love, mirroring itself in some pure,
                  transparent heart. Now, as he gazed up to the beautiful mirror of the sun, shining
                  so high and lonely in the dark blue zenith of midnight, it was to him an emblem of
                  Faith, reflecting to the pilgrim of Time, through the nightshade of sorrow and
                  care, another and heavenlier home. Oh! could Florence but look into the heart<pb
                     n="248-249" xml:id="VAC6692-00000124"/> she so deeply yet innocently wronged!
                  But here we see through a glass darkly, even in our clearest moments; and when the
                  mirror is shivered by passion, what frightful distortion disfigures the image it
                  reflects!</p>
               <p>"My father!" were the only words he uttered, when he arrived at Bellamy Place, and
                  Katy flew into his arms.</p>
               <p>"He lives—he is better," she cried, "but still weak and suffering. Oh! Marcus,
                  dear, dear brother, how I have longed to see you—to be near you once more."</p>
               <p>Katy was always pale, and her eyes had a pensive expression, when unillumined by a
                  smile; but her paleness was that of the white rose in its bloom, sweet and fair to
                  look upon. Now her cheek had a sickly pallor, and her countenance was very sad.
                  Was it filial anxiety alone that caused this? or was it blended with some secret
                  grief? He thought of the dark-browed Delaval, and felt a conviction that his
                  sister's happiness was wrecked, as well as his own. Never had he loved her with
                  such heart-aching tenderness.</p>
               <p>"My Katy, my darling, my own sweet, precious sister," he cried, kissing her
                  colourless cheek. "Mrs. Bellamy, my more than mother!" Her arms too were round
                  him, her mild, benignant countenance emanating unspeakable love. Mr. Bellamy
                  greeted him with all the affection of a father and all the pride of a man. He was
                  proud of the glorious boy he had reared, for his fame had gone abroad into the
                  land.</p>
               <p>"My father!" again repeated Marcus, grasping Mr. Bellamy's hand. "Is he really
                  better? Is his life in danger?"</p>
               <p>"There is danger," answered Mr. Bellamy; "but there is hope also; so Doctor
                  Manning says, who never deludes his friends."</p>
               <p>Katy led her brother to the room where their father lay, at whose bedside Milly
                  was seated, in her ancient costume, waving the feathers of mingled green, gold,
                  and purple over the head of her master. He was asleep, and their gentle entrance
                  did not awake him. Milly could scarcely repress a loud cry of joy at beholding
                  him, but she did, though the big drops burst from her eyes and rolled down her
                  face. Holding the faithful creature's hand in his, he stood looking at the altered
                  but placid features of his father. He had been suffering from a lingering disease,
                  which had gradually reduced his strength, without giving him acute pain, and
                  though he was pale and emaciated, there was a peacefulness, there was even a smile
                  on his sleeping countenance that was soothing to look upon.</p>
               <p>There is certainly a magnetism in the eye, which the spirit feels, even through
                  the prison-bars of sleep. Warland awoke, while his son was gazing sadly, silently
                  upon him, and stretched out his feeble arms. Marcus bent to their enclosure, and
                  laid his cheek against his father's.</p>
               <p>"My son," said the invalid, "I bless God for this. I feared we never would meet
                  again in this world."</p>
               <p>"Many happy meetings, I trust, are in store for us yet, my father," answered
                  Marcus, with a quivering lip. His heart had less hope than his words.</p>
               <p>"Yes, Marcus, I trust so too," cried Warland, raising his eyes to heaven.</p>
               <p>The return of his son seemed to renovate his exhausted system, and for a few days
                  he appeared better and stronger, was able to sit up in bed, supported by pillows,
                  and to converse without much apparent fatigue. The presence of Marcus was the balm
                  of Gilead to his soul, and he had a <emph>kind Physician near.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Warland slept. Aunt Milly, as usual, presided over his slumbers. Marcus took
                  the hand of Katy, and drew it through his arm.</p>
               <p>"Let us walk," said he, going out into the open air. "You look wilted, dear Katy.
                  Such close confinement does not agree with you."</p>
               <p>"It is not that, brother," she answered, with a sigh. They walked under the shade
                  of the hickories, and sat down on a little bench Hannibal had made expressly for
                  her.</p>
               <p>"What is it then, my sister? Do <emph>you</emph> carry in your bosom a wounded
                  heart?" He accented unconsciously on the <emph>you.</emph> Katy looked at him
                  through her long lashes.</p>
               <p>"I received about a week ago," she said, "a letter from<pb n="250-251"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000125"/> Delaval, so strange, so inexplicable—I know not
                  what to think of it. It has made me very unhappy."</p>
               <p>"Will you show it to me, Katy?"</p>
               <p>"I fear—I dread. He speaks of you in such a—such a—manner—I can't comprehend
                  it."</p>
               <p>"I ought to see it. I ought to know how he speaks of me, Katy. Much may depend
                  upon it."</p>
               <p>Katy trembled. Her lips turned as pale as her cheeks. Marcus put his arm round
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Fear not, sweet sister," said he, "I will do nothing to add to your unhappiness,
                  whatever he may say. Could I think of deeds of violence while our father lies
                  languishing on that sick bed?"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed. I know you could not. But, oh Marcus! you cannot think how wretched I
                  have felt to think that letter should cause me more unhappiness than all our
                  father's sufferings. How wicked, how selfish I am! yet I think it is what he says
                  of you makes me wretched. I will get the letter," she added, going into the house,
                  with a step very different from her usual light footfall. She soon returned, and
                  placed it in his outstretched hand. Its brief and incoherent contents were
                  these:</p>

                              Katy, whom I so loved and trusted; whom I verily believed one of the
                              hierarchs of heaven, so much he seemed lifted above his kind; he, the
                              friend and brother of my soul, has insulted my sister beyond
                              forgiveness or remedy. With unexampled ingratitude, and matchless
                              cruelty, he has repaid 'a love passing the love of woman.' Katy, I
                              love, I adore you. I shall never cease to do so. But as long as one
                              spark of vitality burns in my being, I must detest, abhor, and despise
                              your brother.</p>

               <p>"Oh! what have I done? How rash, how wrong I have been!" cried Katy, recoiling
                  from the indignant fire that blazed in the eyes of Marcus, as, hurling the letter
                  to the ground, he sprang up and was hurrying from her. "Stop, Marcus. Don't leave
                  me. Only tell me what he means. What have you done that he should use such
                  dreadful language? I know you cannot have done any thing wrong, never. I hate him
                  for saying so. I never shall love him any more. You don't look at me, Marcus. You
                  won't speak to me. Alas! I have done very wrong, but I meant to do right."</p>
               <p>Marcus turned at that beseeching voice, and an expression of pity softened the
                  fierce splendour of his countenance. He came back and sat down by her on the
                  little shaded bench.</p>
               <p>"Heaven knows what I have done, Katy. I do not. I will tell you all I know." He
                  then related the history of Rosa, the return of his letters, the chain and locket,
                  as well as his subsequent letter of explanation. That a circumstance capable of so
                  simple and honourable an explanation should have caused such an insulting
                  termination of friendship and love, seemed incomprehensible to both, and as
                  unpardonable as incomprehensible. Katy had a good deal of honest pride concealed
                  under her gentle, loving exterior. She adored her brother, and an injury inflicted
                  on him stung her to the quick of her heart. Before she saw him, Delaval's letter
                  had made her unspeakably wretched, from its mysterious accusations of Marcus. They
                  filled her with a vague horror. That Delaval should accuse him without cause, she
                  tried not to believe; that Marcus had given him cause, she <emph>could</emph> not
                  believe. Now, when she heard the only possible reason that could be assigned,
                  indignation lifted her above the weakness of sorrow. She was very beautiful in her
                  anger. It gave such life and spirit to her face.</p>
               <p>"That dear Rosa!" she cried, "how I love her. She did what I longed to do—nursed
                  you on your sick bed, and soothed you back to health and life. To grudge her the
                  possession of a simple locket, and one of those beautiful locks of yours, and<pb
                     n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6692-00000126"/> think it an insult to them, seems
                  shocking. To take it away from the poor girl, how wicked! She must look as Cora
                  did. And you do not know where she is, and whether you will ever see her
                  again."</p>
               <p>Katy was so excited by the wrongs of Rosa, she forgot her own. She hated the proud
                  and jealous Florence, and wondered sisters could influence brothers so much. She
                  wished she had never known Delaval, never thought of love, or allowed a "stranger
                  to intermeddle with her joy."</p>
               <p>"Let us go to our father," said Marcus. "I shall not feel safe from my own
                  passions till I stand by his sick bed."</p>
               <p>"I will follow," said Katy. "I see Mrs. Bellamy beckoning me from her room."</p>
               <p>Marcus went alone to his father's apartment. He found him awake, and refreshed by
                  his repose. Taking Aunt Milly's place, and telling her to go and rest, he seated
                  himself by the bed's head, so that his father could not look into his face.
                  Warland took his son's hand, and drew him gently toward him.</p>
               <p>"I want to see you, my son," he said, "as well as to feel the balm of your
                  presence. What a feverish hand is this!" Then looking fixedly upon him, "Marcus,
                  you are greatly moved. If it is the thought of <emph>my</emph> danger, you must
                  not let it unman you thus. Submission to our God is easy. You will find it so, my
                  son."</p>
               <p>Marcus was too true, too ingenuous to allow his father to impute to filial sorrow
                  the cloud which warring passions had left upon his brow.</p>
               <p>"Father, submission to God may be learned. Whatever blow he may inflict, though it
                  should rend my heart in twain, I trust I can say, His holy will be done. But, when
                  we suffer from the inconstancy, and injustice, and insults of man, oh! father,
                  teach me how to curb my rebel passions; tell me what I ought to do!"</p>
               <p>"Ah! my son, has it come so soon, this bitter knowledge of the injustice of man?
                  Yet, this is the natural consequence of your growing fame. It is only in the
                  sunshine the shadow is seen."</p>
               <p>"No, sir, it is not envy. But let me tell you all. Your wisdom shall guide me, and
                  I feel that your sympathy will console. Father, if you were not lying here on this
                  sick bed, my hand would be grasping the avenging steel. It burns for redress. This
                  is the fever that makes my pulse throb so quick, and fills my veins with a boiling
                  fluid."</p>
               <p>Then Marcus related the history of his estrangement from Florence and Delaval
                  without any reservation, the struggles he felt on the morning of the trial, his
                  self-conquest, and determination to devote himself henceforth to the highest and
                  holiest duties. He repeated the contents of Delaval's letter to Katy, which she
                  had not shown to her father, declaring his conviction that her happiness was
                  destroyed, as well as his own. Mr. Warland listened with breathless attention, and
                  when Marcus had concluded laid his hand impressively on his, and said,—</p>
               <p>"And you believe that Rosa is the cause of all this?"</p>
               <p>"The innocent one, father. What else could the return of the locket to me
                  imply?"</p>
               <p>"Marcus, I feel constrained to reveal to you what I promised to keep secret while
                  you lay sick and wounded. Had you no suspicions that Rosa was other than she
                  seemed?"</p>
               <p>"None, father, none."</p>
               <p>"Yet Rosa and Florence are one."</p>
               <p>"Good heavens, father, it is not possible!"</p>
               <p>"It is even so. Before she entered your sick room, she sent for me, telling me her
                  real name, and placing herself under my protection. She told me, the knowledge
                  that I was with you emboldened her to take the step she had done. She dared not
                  expose herself to the censure of the world by appearing in her true character; but
                  maddened at the intelligence of your danger, she had braved every thing but
                  contumely, to be near and minister to your sufferings. How tenderly, how
                  faithfully she ministered to them, with what virgin delicacy<pb n="254-255"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000127"/> and modesty she maintained her character as a lady,
                  while she preserved her disguise as a servant, your own memory can bear
                  witness."</p>
               <p>Marcus listened to this astounding revelation like one awaking from a nightmare.
                  He could not realize its truth. Yet, when he recalled the form of Rosa, the
                  contour of her chin and neck, a certain graceful motion of the head peculiar to
                  Florence, he wondered at his own stupidity. Then he recollected the darkened
                  chamber, the mulatto dye, the coloured handkerchief that bound up her magnificent
                  tresses, the deep green shade that covered her brilliant eyes and the upper part
                  of her face, and the simple calico frock and white apron that clothed her
                  beautiful figure, and the disguise did seem impenetrable.</p>
               <p>"Could Florence do all this for me, and then cast me from her?" he exclaimed. "How
                  unfathomable is the mystery of her conduct!"</p>
               <p>"Believe me, Marcus, some secret enemy has been at work, and is probably still
                  busy in undermining your interests. She who could prove her love as Florence
                  Delaval has done is no light, capricious damsel, actuated merely by impulse or
                  passion. She has a depth and truth of character I have never seen in one so young.
                  You have often told me, Marcus, that you had never known me fail in my estimate of
                  man or woman. I am willing to stake my life—ah, that is of little value, it is
                  fast waning away,—I will only say, nothing could shake my confidence in the
                  strength and purity of her affection in her self-sacrificing and generous
                  nature."</p>
               <p>"Bless you, father—not once, but ten thousand times—for this undoubting trust. You
                  make me blush for my own injustice, as much as I do for my blindness and
                  stupidity, in not recognising L'éclair through any disguise. But surely I must
                  have known her sweet and silver voice. The ear cannot be deceived."</p>
               <p>Mr. Warland smiled. "Florence has all a woman's wit. I saw her myself put cotton
                  between her rosy lips, to thicken that sweet and silver voice. She closed every
                  avenue to detection, and her disguise was so perfect, I do not wonder that you
                  never penetrated it."</p>
               <p>"Had you ever seen her in the splendour of her beauty, father, you
                     <emph>would</emph> wonder that I did not discover some gleam that would show
                  her identity."</p>
               <p>"I saw her once," said Mr. Warland, "without her disguise. It was one evening when
                  you were sleeping under the influence of a powerful anodyne. She took me in
                  another room, and stepping into an adjoining closet, soon returned, another and
                  yet the same. She had washed the stain from her face and hands, unbound the
                  handkerchief from her rich curling hair, and taken the shade from her dazzling
                  eyes. I never saw such a transformation. Coming toward me, and placing her hands
                  with endearing frankness in mine, she said, 'I wanted you to see me as I am for
                  one moment. I am dark by nature, but not quite a mulatto. Do you think it strange
                  that Marcus does not recognise me?' Marcus, my dear boy, I cannot tell you how
                  strangely I was affected at that moment. To look at this magnificent creature, and
                  think it was for love of you, my son, that she assumed the guise of a menial,
                  braved the displeasure of her friends and the risk of discovery, was enough to
                  move the heart of any man. I yearned to take her in my arms to my heart, and tell
                  her that I loved her as a daughter. And I did, Marcus. I shall never see her
                  again, but bear to her my parting blessing. As sure as there is a moon in yonder
                  heavens, she loves you, and an enemy is trying to sever her from you."</p>
               <p>A sudden faintness came over him, and he sank back on the pillow. Marcus, in
                  alarm, presented a cordial to his lips, which soon revived him.</p>
               <p>"This has been too much for you, father," said Marcus, with bitter self-reproach.
                  "I am killing you by my selfishness. Do not speak again."</p>
               <p>"One word more, Marcus. This enemy, I believe—but—you will discover him."</p>
               <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6692-00000128"/>
               <p>Closing his eyes, he pressed the hand of his son, who, struck by his words, felt
                  as if thick scales were falling from his eyes, and thick clouds rolling away from
                  his strangely darkened understanding. Marcus did not forget to repeat to his
                  sister the conversation he had had with his father, and Katy slept that night with
                  a somewhat lightened heart.</p>
               <p>Mr. Warland gradually grew weaker, till even Doctor Manning, the all-hopeful
                  physician, gave up hope. But his disease seemed scarcely to diminish the strength
                  of his lungs, and his mind was clear and calm to the last.</p>
               <p>"There is retribution in this world, as well as in the next," he said. "I am dying
                  the victim of my early excesses. Nature sooner or later avenges her violated laws,
                  and assists the judgment of the Almighty."</p>
               <p>Seeing Milly, who was standing by the bedside, he held out his hand to her, with
                  great emotion.</p>
               <p>"The blessing of God and that of a dying man rest upon you, faithful friend and
                  affectionate guardian of my orphan children. When bereft of a mother, and
                  neglected by a father, with none to cherish and protect, you fostered them in your
                  arms of love, and shielded them from poverty and wrong. To their gratitude and
                  kindness I commend you; to the care of God I commit you."</p>
               <p>"Oh, master," sobbed the weeping negro, "you allos good to Milly."</p>
               <p>"Was I good," said the contrite man, "when I would have sold you, in face of my
                  solemn vow, had not my boy stepped between me and my sin and shame?"</p>
               <p>"Don't speak of it, master, don't. I forgot all that, long time ago—the Lord be
                  praised, I have."</p>
               <p>"I love to speak of it," replied her master, with deep humility. "It magnifies the
                  mercy that has saved me—the love that has forgiven."</p>
               <p>The day before he died he called Marcus to him and said: "I have one request to
                  make. It matters little where our dust is laid, when the spark that animates it is
                  fled. Yet we all have our wishes on this solemn subject. Your mother is laid in
                  the tomb of her fathers, far away from here. They came, obedient to her dying
                  prayer, and bore her where I may not follow. But there is one spot, one sweet and
                  quiet spot, where I would fain sleep in my last repose. We have often sat together
                  there, while the pensive voice of the fountain murmured in our ears. Bury me, my
                  son, near the Long Moss Spring, where the river's roar and the fountain's gush
                  shall be my requiem. When you told me of poor Simon's lonely grave, I thought how
                  pleasant it would be to bear him company."</p>
               <p>"Even so, father," cried Marcus, "it shall be as your soul desires. Your children
                  will one day come and lie down by your side. It always seemed to me that the sleep
                  of the grave would be sweet, near the sound of those lulling waters."</p>
               <p>Mr. Warland died. But so triumphant was his faith, so peaceful his departure, that
                  death was disarmed of its terrors and grief of its sting. Nature mourned, but
                  religion consoled.</p>
               <p>They carried his remains to the lovely spot his dying lips had designated. Mr. and
                  Mrs. Bellamy accompanied their adopted children. It was the desire of Hannibal to
                  go with Milly; and these two faithful friends, and we may add
                     <emph>benefactors,</emph> of both families, followed him they loved to his
                  quiet grave.</p>
               <p>With indescribable emotions Mr. and Mrs. Bellamy beheld a scene, consecrated in
                  their remembrance by the most dear and interesting associations. To the apparently
                  accidental circumstance of lingering one night under that humble roof, they were
                  indebted for years of happiness. They had been happy in the friendship and
                  companionship of the good and gifted man, who was then lost to society, a slave to
                  one evil passion—happy in the love and gratitude of the lovely girl, the noble
                  young man, who but for them might have remained in the obscurity of a ferryman's
                  cabin. They looked at Marcus and recalled their last thought—a spirit like his
                  would have forced its way to distinction, though mountains and rocks opposed its
                  path. It would have fulfilled its glorious<pb n="258-259"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000129"/> destiny. Theirs was the honour and the joy of
                  assisting its upward progress.</p>
               <p>It was a solemn yet not melancholy burial. The beautiful fountain smiled and sang,
                  as if it welcomed a bride to the magnolia bower. The <hi rend="i"/>Long Moss
                  gently waved and curled against the sides of the snowy basin, and the water-lily's
                  undulating stem glided like a green serpent under the waves. On the side opposite
                  to that, where the old soldier rested, they made the grave of Warland. There they
                  were laid, representatives of two distinct races, the black and white, laid in
                  those slumbers that know no awaking, till the Apocalyptic angel shall come, with
                  one foot on sea and one on land, and declare, after the seven thunders are hushed,
                  that the mystery of God is finished, and that Time shall be no more.</p>
               <p>The family entered the cabin. Milly lingered by the grave of Simon, and discoursed
                  to Hannibal of his Christian virtues and surprising learning. "He sent me all his
                  arnings," said Milly, "sewed up like a charm, in a leather bag. I wouldn't use it,
                  'cause it's sacred money. I'm going to get Master Marcus to have a monument for to
                  petrify his mem'ry, at this 'xpense. The Scriptures tell us to 'tend to all sich
                  things. Noah bought a cave to bury his wife in, 'fore the big flood came and
                  swallow him up, in the mouth of the whale."</p>
               <p>"I heern Master Bellamy say," replied Hannibal, whose thoughts had been wandering
                  to the little green enclosure where Cora slept, "he 'tended to build a sorter
                  temple here, 'cause he call it holy ground. Folk, sailing 'long the river see it
                  and ask 'Who that there?' Then somebody say 'Good Master Warland,'—and—what that
                  old nigger's name, Milly?"</p>
               <p>"He wa'n't a nigger, no how," said Milly, indignantly. "He preacher of the gospel,
                  and gentleman of culler. Everybody 'spect ole Simon, and raal niggers take off
                  their hat when they speak in his presence. When the Lord take me to heaven, I pray
                  young master to let me come too and lie 'long side of good old Simon and blessed
                  ole master."</p>
               <p>"When <emph>I</emph> done dead," said Hannibal, a shade of melancholy deepening on
                  his sable face, "I gonter sleep where Cora sleep, and the white angels come down
                  and cuvver us both all up with their 'visible wings. I willing to die, jist to be
                  where she gone to."</p>
               <p>We hope you are not weary because we have brought you once again to the borders of
                  the <hi rend="i"/>Long Moss Spring. It is the last time we shall ask you to bear
                  us company to that sweet and hallowed spot. Farewell, fair and peaceful waters.
                  Farewell, ye green and silver-tinted plumes, ye bright-leaved, verdant hollies.
                  Superb magnolia, sentinel of the lonely dead, we bid thee too farewell. Perchance
                  some young lovers, after crossing the river's tide, may seat themselves under thy
                  shades, and write their vows on the waxen petals of thy regal blossoms, heedless
                  of the dust that consecrates the fountain's margin. But to us, perennial Spring,
                  thou speakest of thrilling memories. We love thy name. It is embalmed in our
                  recollection, and it sounds like music to our ears. Sweet <hi rend="i"/>Long Moss

               <p>THE shadow of death lingers long on the threshold over which his footsteps have
                  passed. When the family returned to Bellamy Place, every thing looked sad and
                  changed. The foliage of the hickories had a darker tinge; even the negroes that
                  thronged round the carriage to welcome them home seemed blacker in hue. The echoes
                  of their footsteps, as they walked through the closed and silent rooms, sounded
                  like "voices from the dead." They had returned, but one loved and revered was left
                  behind. There was a vacant chair, which<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6692-00000130"/>
                  would never more be filled; there was a dark chamber that no one wished to enter;
                  a name each lip trembled as it repeated.</p>
               <p>Katy threw herself into her brother's arms, and wept. "Oh! Marcus," she repeated,
                  "it seemed to me all the way home as if I should find him here."</p>
               <p>"He is here, my sister," answered he, "he is in our hearts, where we shall ever
                  find him. Those only die who leave behind no memory of virtue."</p>
               <p>It was a sad moment to all when Marcus again left them, but he had professional
                  engagements which he was bound in honour to fulfil. He was resolved too, according
                  to his father's dying counsels, to visit Wood Lawn, and demand an explanation of
                  the mysterious charges against him. The proof that Florence had given of
                  self-sacrificing love made the immolation of his pride an act of justice and
                  gratitude. His father too had left him a sacred trust, his orphan sister's
                  happiness. If his own were irretrievably lost, <emph>that</emph> could never be
                  restored.</p>
               <p>"I will find out mine enemy," cried the young man, "though I rend asunder Bastile
                  bars to lay hold of him. He shall not escape my just and righteous vengeance."</p>
               <p>While the inmates of Bellamy Place had been receiving the solemn lesson of
                  mortality into their chastened hearts, the young master and mistress of Wood Lawn
                  had been trying to escape from themselves by every means their wealth permitted
                  them to indulge. But Florence carried an arrow in her bosom that penetrated deeper
                  and deeper, while her eyes, like lamps unfed with oil, shone with faint and
                  wavering lustre. Mrs. Lewis, noticing with alarm her fading colour, insisted upon
                  sending for a physician, but this Florence strenuously forbade. Mr. Alston advised
                  the waters of the White Sulphur Springs in Virginia, but the season was too far
                  advanced to remain long, and this too Florence resisted, from a vague hope that
                  something would occur at home—she knew not what—to relieve her unspeakable misery.
                  Delaval endeavoured to sustain her and himself too by the marble pillar of pride,
                  which he grasped with cold and sliding hands; but though she pressed her aching
                  heart against it, it only mocked its throbbing anguish. Those only who have loved
                  as deeply, passionately, and exclusively as Florence, can conceive of her
                  unutterable desolation.</p>
               <p>Letty, her negro attendant, watched her young mistress with sorrowful devotion.
                  She was certain from the first there was treachery somewhere. She longed to
                  discover it. That the unhappiness of Florence had its origin in the letter which
                  had dropped from the pamphlet, and was written by Marcus, she was well aware. She
                  was forbidden to mention the subject in terms she dared not disregard; but the
                  determination to find out the mystery of the letter grew stronger every day. If
                  she could only get to Mr. Patterson's! But, upon what plea could she ask leave of
                  absence to visit a place with which she had never had any communication? Her
                  mistress would suspect her motive, and it would be a sufficient reason for denial.
                  At length circumstances favoured Letty's long-cherished wishes. There was a
                  camp-meeting in the neighbourhood of Mr. Patterson's, which she expressed a strong
                  desire to attend. Florence, who was an indulgent mistress, readily granted her
                  request. She was even glad to be rid of the surveillance of the negro's shrewd,
                  affectionate eye. She wanted to be alone in the solitude of her heart. She wanted
                  no one near, not even her brother to say to her, by a glance of sympathy, "How
                  lone, how dreary it is!" A hundred times she repeated to herself the thrilling,
                  despairing strains of Scotia's sweetest bard:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Had I a cave on some wild, distant shore,</l>
                        <l>Where the winds howl to the waves' dashing roar,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">There would I weep my woes,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">There seek my lost repose,</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Letty departed in high spirits, in a covered wagon filled with negroes, bound, as
                  they verily believed, for the promised land. The camp-meeting ground, in their
                  estimation, was the flooring of heaven, and many of them expected to find there
                     ready-made<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6692-00000131"/> made wings, that would
                  bear them up to the blue ceiling arching over them. They sang and shouted the
                  whole way. Letty, with the improvisation of genius, went off into impromptus,
                  which the less gifted ones repeated after her with increasing spirit: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>I'm going to the promised land,</l>
                        <l>Just to find out what I can;</l>
                        <l>Old master Satan hide among the bushes,</l>
                        <l>I mean to catch 'em, and all de loaf and fishes.</l>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Letty was really an African <foreign xml:lang="FRA">improvisatrice,</foreign> and
                  on this occasion entitled herself to immortal laurels. Like the Egyptian priests,
                  she veiled her true meaning in a kind of hieroglyphic style, but her songs all had
                  one burden, whose weight was known only to herself: <q>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus imparting inspiration to all, Letty went on her way rejoicing. The party were
                  absent a week, and long after their return the night-shades of Wood Lawn were made
                  vocal by these remembered strains.</p>
               <p>Letty made ten times more grimaces than ever, and sometimes bit her tongue in a
                  most portentous manner. Her odd, ugly countenance said as plain as words could
                  speak it, "I knows what I knows, but I winna tell you."</p>
               <p>In her brighter, merrier moments, Florence had made it a practice, after supper,
                  to play on the piano some inspiring air, for Letty to dance, who was one of the
                  most light, airy, graceful sylphs on the floor one could possibly imagine. A few
                  evenings after her return, Letty came in with a white handkerchief pinned to her
                  side, and begged her young mistress just for one tune. "She was obliged to dance,"
                  she said, "she could not help it, and it did look so bad to shake the toes about
                  without music."</p>
               <p>Florence, with a languid smile, seated herself at the instrument, and Letty was
                  soon floating, like a black feather, on the liquid sounds. There were always about
                  a half dozen black heads peeping in at the door to witness the performance, for
                  Letty, in consequence of her wit, <emph>genius,</emph> and grace, in spite of her
                  ugly features, was the reigning belle of the plantation. She was compelled to stop
                  in her airy performance by the ringing of the door-bell, whose summons she obeyed
                  with alacrity.</p>
               <p>"Master Alfred Patterson," said she, throwing the parlour door wide open, showing
                  all the ivory of her mouth. "Please walk in."</p>
               <p>Florence rose from the piano, suffused with burning blushes. The remembrance of
                  the letter addressed to him covered her with shame, and plunged her in
                  humiliation. Surprised at her emotion, the young man could not help indulging a
                  hope, that, though once rejected, he was not altogether an object of indifference.
                  The invitation, too, he had so unexpectedly received, to visit Wood Lawn, made
                  this emotion still more flattering, more easy to translate in his favour. Delaval
                  felt embarrassed, on his sister's account, but he was too much the master of
                  himself not to welcome him with cordial politeness, and enter at once into
                  familiar conversation.</p>
               <p>"This is an unexpected pleasure," said he. "You have become so much of a bookworm
                  lately, I feared we never should see you again."</p>
               <p>"I could not refuse so polite an invitation," answered Patterson, "when it
                  corresponded so well with my own wishes."</p>
               <p>The countenance of Delaval expressed such manifest surprise, that Patterson
                  involuntarily turned toward Letty, who was fidgeting near the door.</p>
               <p>"The fact is, master," said Letty, giving one of her peculiar winks, "I see Master
                  Patterson at the camp-ground, and I give him your 'spects, and Miss Florence's,
                  too, and tell him you be glad to see him any time, but 'specially right off."</p>
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6692-00000132"/>
               <p>"She anticipated our wishes," said Delaval, with ready politeness. "The earliest
                  time is always the best to welcome an old friend. Have you supped?"</p>
               <p>"No," said Patterson, wondering at the audacity of the negro, who had given him a
                  pressing invitation, as if it came directly from her master and mistress.</p>
               <p>"Well, come into the dining-room, where I left my uncle and Mrs. Lewis discussing
                  family matters, while my sister regaled us with a little music."</p>
               <p>Delaval led their guest to the dining-room, while Florence turned to rebuke Letty
                  for her unauthorized boldness. She had disappeared, and the bell again ringing,
                  announced a visitor. She was now alone in the parlour, still seated at the piano,
                  over whose keys her fingers were lightly and unconsciously running. There was
                  something in the tread of the person who crossed the threshold that made her start
                  up and turn her face toward the door. It was Marcus Warland, standing a few paces
                  within, whose glance met hers, not cold and haughty, as when she had seen him the
                  last time, but beaming with intense emotion. His face was very pale, and he wore
                  on his arm the sable badge of mourning. Florence gazed like one awaking from a
                  dream, then clasping her hand with an expression of rapture, was about to spring
                  forward, when suddenly something seemed to arrest her, and freeze her to the spot
                  where she stood. If one could imagine fire suddenly congealing, it would convey
                  the impression of the transition of that moment.</p>
               <p>"Florence," cried he, advancing, "L'éclair, in the name of heaven, tell me what I
                  have done to estrange the heart I once thought wholly mine. If love is
                  extinguished, justice and truth must still remain. In their sacred names I demand
                  to know my crime, that I may justify my character, or if I have a secret enemy, as
                  I well believe I have, avenge my wrongs."</p>
               <p>Florence looked upon him with an astonished glance. How could the man who had
                  written such words of her assume this lofty tone and indignant air?
                     <emph>He</emph> seemed the <emph>injured,</emph> instead of the
                     <emph>injurer;</emph> the <emph>victim,</emph> instead of the
                     <emph>sacrificer.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Mr. Warland has no worse enemy than himself," replied Florence, with
                  inexpressible dignity. "His own words have condemned him, his own hand signed the
                  death-warrant of my love."</p>
               <p>"By heaven, Florence! I begin to fear that we are all going mad! I cannot be put
                  off with these dark and enigmatical sayings. After all that has passed between us,
                  I have a right to openness and sincerity. Oh, L'éclair!—Oh, Rosa! by the memory of
                  your unparalleled devotion, by those celestial ministrations which brought me back
                  to life, and which my whole life can never repay, I implore you not to trifle with
                  my happiness, and thereby destroy your own."</p>
               <p>This allusion to her disguise, and the cares she had lavished on him in his sick
                  room, again sent the haughty blood to her cheeks. It was the crimson of shame
                  blended with the deeper hue of pride and anger. The words seemed literally to
                  sting her.</p>
               <p>"That you should allude, at this moment, to an act of infatuation, that I now
                  mourn in dust and ashes," cried she, almost choked with contending passions, "is a
                  crowning insult, which I never can pardon. Go, sir," she continued, terror
                  contracting her brow, and quivering on her lip; "go, sir, before my brother comes.
                  I know not what he will do if he sees you here. Will you not go, or do you wish to
                  drive me really mad?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will go, never again to expose myself to wrongs which, being inflicted by
                  a woman, I can never redress. But your brother and I must meet, and from him I
                  will learn what you refuse to reveal. He shall give me the name of my enemy, if he
                  has to write it in my heart's blood."</p>
               <p>"Once again I repeat," she cried, "you have no enemy but Marcus Warland. You need
                  no traducer. You have had none. It is mockery to ask an explanation; worse than
                  mockery."</p>
               <p>Marcus looked upon her steadfastly one moment. In that moment her image, as he had
                  seen it at different periods of<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6692-00000133"/> their
                  intercourse, passed rapidly before him, like the phantasma of a dream. The
                  childlike, bewitching fairy of the fountain, the incarnate Lightning that gilded
                  the hall of the university, the playful, gentle, fascinating mistress of that
                  lordly mansion, the inspired sibyl of the library, the loving, impassioned
                  companion of the moonlight hour,—and last of all, the tender, humble, artless
                  nurse. What a beautiful picture gallery it made! And there she stood, so changed,
                  so near, and yet appearing so far off. She seemed to have altered the very style
                  of her dress, so as to destroy the identity of the Florence of other days. Her
                  hair, instead of falling in wild, luxuriant wreaths around her person, was
                  gathered up behind, and fastened with a silver comb, at the sides of which the
                  ringlets dropped, as if ready to fall from their own abundance. The features had a
                  marble rigidity of outline, in lieu of their former bewitching softness. The
                  lovely, radiant Creole was transformed to a cold Grecian statue. It was a Galatea
                  before Pygmalion had warmed her with the divine breath of love.</p>
               <p>Marcus felt his heart swell almost to bursting. He had been under the spell of an
                  enchantress, who could sport at will with the passions of man. With a mighty
                  effort he would break this spell, and free himself from her power. He approached
                  the door, and placed his foot upon the threshold.</p>
               <p>"I came," said he, "from the grave of my father, who bade me bear to you his
                  parting blessing—a blessing hallowed by the solemnities of death and the prospect
                  of eternity. I go now from the grave of my buried love, bearing with me a lesson
                  more awful than that his dying accents taught me. <emph>They</emph> breathed of
                  hope and immortality. There is more of death around me now than I saw in his
                  shrouded form."</p>
               <p>He turned and passed hastily through the hall, when Letty, flying out through a
                  side-door, arrested his steps.</p>
               <p>"Stop, Master Marcus; you mustn't go," cried the negro girl, making vehement
                  gestures. "You don't know what I knows. It'll all be 'clared up. Jist wait a
                  minnit. Master Patterson himself is here. The Lord sent you, sure enough, this
                  very night."</p>
               <p>"Let me pass," cried Marcus, in a more haughty tone than he had ever addressed to
                  a negro before. "I cannot, will not be detained."</p>
               <p>"Master Marcus mustn't go till he hear something," said Letty, jumping into the
                  doorway and putting her arms across as a barrier. "He be sorry all his life-long
                  if he no mind what this nigger say. Miss Florence been 'ceived, that she has. She
                  been most raving 'stracted 'bout it. Takes Letty to find out where old Satan hide
                  his nose. Come along back, Master Marcus."</p>
               <p>The eloquence of Letty had attracted the attention of Delaval, who was passing
                  from the dining-room to the parlour, in company with Patterson. Seeing a gentleman
                  in black, whose egress Letty seemed resolutely resisting, he came forward,
                  wondering what it could mean. The eyes of these two estranged young men met in the
                  twilight rays of the shaded lamp that hung above the staircase. They burned upon
                  each other with mutual scorn and ire.</p>
               <p>"I came," said Marcus, placing his back against the doorpost, and folding his arms
                  across his breast, "to demand an explanation of the reiterated insults I have
                  received. My letters are returned unopened. I am commanded to leave the presence
                  of the sister, lest the brother should wreak his vengeance upon me; and I call
                  upon the Almighty God that made me, to bear witness that I have never injured you
                  or her, in thought, word, or action. Who talks of injury? Mine is the injury, deep
                  as life itself. In friendship, as in love, I have only too blindly trusted, been
                  too fatally deceived."</p>
               <p>Marcus raised his voice with the energy of passion. Delaval was about to reply,
                  when Letty, stepping between them, cried out: "Master George, oh! Master George,
                  please come into the parlour, and you too, Master Marcus, where Miss Florence and
                     <unclear>Master</unclear> Patterson is, and I'll 'clare it all up, jist like
                     moonshine<pb n="268-269" xml:id="VAC6692-00000134"/> shine. I got Master
                  Patterson here o' purpose, 'cause I know white folks don't believe all a nigger
                  say. Master Marcus haint done nothing wrong, nohow. I never think he did. I find
                  out who Belzebub be."</p>
               <p>"There may be something in this," said Delaval, who had been excessively struck by
                  the tones and looks of Marcus, so expressive of outraged innocence. "Warland, will
                  you come? Vindicate yourself from this aspersion, if you can, and relieve me of a
                  burden that has wellnigh crushed me to the earth."</p>
               <p>Marcus bowed his head, and walked in silent dignity, side by side with Delaval
                  into the room from which he had just been banished. Delaval motioned to a chair,
                  but Marcus refused the offered courtesy.</p>
               <p>"I never again sit down under your roof," said he, in a calm voice, "till I am
                  requested to do it <emph>as</emph> a friend, and <emph>by</emph> a friend."</p>
               <p>Florence was seated on a sofa, in a state of passive agony, between her uncle and
                  Mr. Patterson. The latter rose and greeted Marcus with great cordiality. Letty had
                  followed the young gentlemen into the parlour, with a face of unutterable
                  meanings.</p>
               <p>"And now," said Delaval in a commanding tone to the negro, "tell me
                     <emph>what</emph> you know, and <emph>all</emph> you know."</p>
               <p>"Before I begins," said Letty, folding her hands with serene importance, "I must
                  ask Miss Florence to please be so kind as to 'xibit the letter she drop out of the
                  book on dis here floor."</p>
               <p>"Letty," cried Florence, starting on her feet, "have I not forbidden you"——</p>
               <p>"Sister," said Delaval, "I entreat you to let her have her way. Permit the letter
                  to be exhibited, as Letty says, that Mr. Warland may not assert we gave him no
                  opportunity of vindication."</p>
               <p>While Florence with evident reluctance left the room, Mr. Alston rose, and waving
                  his hand with his accustomed dignity, exclaimed: "This seems to me a very
                  extraordinary proceeding ing, for a young lady of Miss Delaval's station to obey
                  the bidding of a slave, and to be called upon to display her private papers in
                  this promiscuous company. I must say I disapprove of this transaction, and protest
                  against the interference of this very officious negro."</p>
               <p>"Uncle, I beg of you to let things have their course. They have gone too far to
                  recede. I have invited this young gentleman to return, and by the shade of Cicero
                  he shall have a hearing."</p>
               <p>Florence entered at this moment, and advancing to Patterson, with haughty grace
                  gave the letter into his hands.</p>
               <p>"This is your property, sir, I believe," she said. "It was left by accident in the
                  leaves of a pamphlet which you had the politeness to send me. Can it be a matter
                  of surprise to you that the writer of that letter should find himself here, an
                  unwelcome and unhonoured guest?"</p>
               <p>"Why, this is a letter from Mr. Warland!" said Patterson, looking at it with
                  surprise. "I know not how it came in that pamphlet; but surely he never wrote any
                  thing to me which could give offence to you, or any human being."</p>
               <p>"Just please look inside of the 'velope," said Letty, "and see if that be the
                  right one. Heap of fine coats put on over ole rags and tatters."</p>
               <p>Marcus stood in dignified silence, with that proud curl of the lip which gave
                  inexpressible beauty to the passion of scorn. He saw Patterson glance his eye
                  carelessly over the contents of the letter.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I recollect this very well," cried the latter; "a business letter, which can
                  interest no one but the parties concerned. But what is this? A postscript? twice
                  the length of the letter, too! I never saw this before.
                  Strange—unaccountable!"</p>
               <p>He read on, and as he read, perplexity and indignation were visible on his
                  knitting brows and in his kindling eyes.</p>
               <p>"This is foul, iniquitous," he exclaimed. "Warland never<pb n="270-271"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000135"/> wrote a line of this postscript, never. How it came
                  here the power of darkness only knows."</p>
               <p>"That me," cried Letty. "I knows how it came there, I 'spect."</p>
               <p>"Allow me to see what they have done me the honour to attribute to me," cried
                  Marcus, advancing and taking the letter from the hand of Patterson.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Marcus!" exclaimed Florence, springing forward and endeavouring to snatch the
                  paper with her trembling fingers, "read not, I pray you, those shameful words. You
                  never, never will forgive me for having believed, for one moment, that you could
                  have been the author. Marcus—in pity for my shame, in pity for my penitence, my
                  deep humiliation, refrain from the perusal of those disgraceful lines."</p>
               <p>Clinging to his arm with impassioned and appealing looks, in which joy, ecstasy,
                  and self-reproach were struggling for mastery, Florence sought to gain possession
                  of the vile forgery, that had caused her so much misery. Delaval had hold of his
                  other hand, squeezing it with the old <foreign xml:lang="FRA">tourniquet</foreign>
                  gripe.</p>
               <p>"Warland," said he in a husky voice, "I wish you would take a pistol and shoot me
                  through the head. I am sure I deserve it, and ten times more, for being the dupe
                  of such villany. Forgive me, Warland, if you can. God knows you have not suffered
                  alone."</p>
               <p>"I <emph>must</emph> know my alleged crime," answered Marcus, returning the warm
                  grasp of Delaval's hand, and gently releasing the letter from the agitated fingers
                  of Florence. "Let there be no more concealments, no more mystery. For your sakes
                  as well as mine, oppose me not, I pray you. Your vindication, I doubt not, is
                  contained in this letter."</p>
               <p>The letter it is unnecessary to transcribe, for, as Patterson remarked, "the
                  contents were interesting only to the parties concerned;" but the postscript, so
                  mysteriously added, in a handwriting so exactly resembling that of Marcus it could
                  not be told from the original, we will insert, that Florence and Delaval may be
                  vindicated in the hearts of others for their injustice to Marcus. It was this:</p>
               <p>"What I am now about to say is in perfect confidence. I know you will never betray
                  the trust of a friend, especially when another is concerned, in whom I know you
                  have a deep interest. That you are a lover of the heiress of Wood Lawn, is no
                  secret to the world. That I have been so fortunate as to be honoured with her
                  favour, is a fact perhaps more notorious. My motive in introducing the subject to
                  you is disinterested, and I think you will appreciate it. I fear <emph>you</emph>
                  have been rejected for my sake. As in these days young men mostly marry for money,
                  I presume the worldly advantages of the match have not been overlooked by you. I
                  add this, to say to you in the unreserve of perfect friendship, that I am willing
                  to withdraw all claims to a priority in her regard. Perhaps there is not another
                  young man in the world who would be affected as I have been by the proof she has
                  lately given of her devotion to me. <emph>You</emph> know, everybody must know by
                  this time, that she followed me, disguised as a mulatto, and stayed with me during
                  that sickness occasioned by the wound inflicted by the rascal Pellam. I ought to
                  feel grateful and exceedingly flattered by such an unheard-of act of affection;
                  but I acknowledge that I am so fastidious, it has filled me with the deepest
                  disgust. It has annihilated every particle of the love I once felt. Indeed, so
                  great is my present repugnance, that even the prospect of possessing her splendid
                  fortune cannot reconcile me to the thought of a union. Now, if it is the fortune
                  you desire rather than the girl, all this will make no difference with you. Should
                  you be disposed to resume your addresses, you may release me from a very
                  disagreeable scrape. That fiery brother of hers may get me into difficulty. I do
                  not wish to fight him, as I really like him. This is all <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >sub rosa.</foreign> Let me know your intentions very soon."</p>
               <p>It would be difficult to describe the feelings of Marcus while perusing this
                  shameful forgery. That Florence should<pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6692-00000136"/>
                  have been deceived by the handwriting he could not wonder, for it was the exact
                  counterpart of his own; that, being deceived, she should feel insulted, wounded,
                  and outraged, as never woman was before, he could not wonder. His greatest wonder
                  was, that Delaval had not shot or stabbed him, in the first storm of his anger.
                  Crushing the vile paper in his hands, he looked at Florence, who was no longer the
                  cold, rigid statue, but the Galatea, warmed by the divine breath of love. Their
                  hearts rushed to each other in that lightning glance, and their hands,
                  involuntarily extended, sealed by their pressure the reconciliation that glance
                  expressed. The words that came to their lips were too sacred to be uttered in the
                  presence of others. They did not, could not speak. Neither did Delaval, who again
                  grasped the hand of Marcus, and, throwing his arm over his shoulder, drew him
                  closely to his side.</p>
               <p>In the burst of emotion that followed the perusal of the letter, Letty's agency
                  and promised explanation were momentarily overlooked. She waited impatiently for
                  the subsiding of their full and passionate feelings, then twirling her fingers,
                  and coughing elaborately, she recalled their attention to herself.</p>
               <p>"Do you really know, my clever darkie," asked Patterson, "who wrote that
                  abominable thing? If you <emph>can</emph> enlighten us on this subject, you shall
                  have more money in your purse than you can spend between now and Christmas. Speak
                  and tell us all about it."</p>
               <p>"Well, master, you must let me have my own way," answered Letty, speaking with
                  consequential deliberation, "and I'll tell you what I knows, and clarify the whole
                  subject. I seen a long time how every thing going wrong. Ever since Miss Florence
                  drop that are letter and pick it up, she no had no peace, no satisfaction of her
                  life. She told me never mention Master Marcus' name, long as I live, and I knowed
                  that wa'n't nateral. So I thinks and thinks, and does nothing but think, how to
                  bring matters right, when I heern of the camp-meeting, and sot off. Then I made
                  bold to go to Master Patterson's. I got 'quainted with Creasy, one of his
                  house-women, at the campground. She got religion there, and she so happy; she love
                  everybody and every thing, and me too. She invited me go home with her, and that
                  what jist what I wanted. I made myself agreeable o' purpose. Well, when I gets to
                  Master Patterson's, and I feels sorter at home, and talks kinder familiar like, I
                  asked who visited her master, and if she 'membered who was there when he sent a
                  bundle of papers to my young mistress. Says Creasy, says she, 'Nobody here that
                  time, 'less it was Master Pellam. Yes, Master Pellam was here, one, two, three day
                  then.'"</p>
               <p>"Pellam!" repeated her auditors, looking at each other. Florence turned a
                  remorseful look toward her uncle. She had been suspecting—she could not help
                     it—<emph>his</emph> immaculate <emph>irreproachability.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"Another wound in the back!" said Marcus, involuntarily, "another coward
                  thrust!"</p>
               <p>"Well, as soon as she tell me this," resumed Letty, animated by the impression she
                  had made, "I questions and questions her, all in a roundabout way, just like a
                  Christian for all, and this is what I finds out. One morning, when Master
                  Patterson gone to the plantation, she see Master Pellam in the next room. Upper
                  part of the door all of glass, so she see him good as could be. He never 'spected
                  Creasy close by. She mighty quiet body, you know; keep still as a mouse, think a
                  heap tho'. Well, she 'member seeing him take up a letter off the secrerary, pull
                  it out of the 'velope, and sorter ponder over it. Then set down and write away on
                  the same paper a long time. She 'member too how he keep looking over one shoulder
                  and then t'other, as tho' somebody right there. S'pose he thought ole Satan 'hind
                  him. So he be, sure enough. Then he put it in the kiver, and stick it in a little
                  book, and clap some newspapers on top on't, and made up a sorter of a bundle She
                  never thought of no harm, Creasy didn't, but she mighty<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000137"/> obsarving person, and got a powerful strong memory.
                  'Sides, Creasy she say she 'members seeing Master Pellam giving the bundle to her
                  master, and ask him to send it to Miss Florence, 'cause she like to read the
                  news."</p>
               <p>"This is true," said Patterson. "I remember his staying at home that morning, on
                  the plea of having letters to write, and I unlocked my secretary for his use. I
                  had read him Warland's letter the night before—at least a portion of it."</p>
               <p>"The packet came in your name," said Florence. "Had Pellam's been mentioned, I
                  might have suspected something treacherous. Yet, even then, blind and wilful girl
                  that I am, I fear I would have been guilty of the injustice and wrong that through
                  life I shall vainly rue."</p>
               <p>Marcus bent down, and said something to her in a low voice, that brought a rich
                  glow to her cheeks and a smile to her lips, but no one else heard the words he
                  uttered.</p>
               <p>"I told the servant that it was sent by Pellam, but I suppose he forgot or
                  neglected the message," said Patterson. "I was not aware that he possessed this
                  wonderful talent of imitation. But what motive could have prompted an act of such
                  cold-blooded malice? Have you ever injured or thwarted him, Warland?"</p>
               <p>"I have been so unfortunate as to cross his path," answered Marcus, looking
                  unconsciously toward Florence, "and I cannot wonder that he does not look upon me
                  as a friend. He has sought to injure me more than once, and the weapons have been
                  turned against his own breast. One never forgives the man whom they have wronged.
                  This is the secret of Pellam's deadly malice. He has more mind than I have given
                  him credit for, and, like yourself, I was ignorant of his peculiar talent for
                  forgery."</p>
               <p>"I was aware that he excelled in penmanship," said Mr. Alston, who had been
                  watching for a favourable opening for a speech. "He was distinguished for this
                  when a boy, and amused himself by imitating the handwriting of others. Had my
                  nephew and niece confided to me the very unpleasant circumstances which have come
                  to my knowledge this evening, I think I could have explained them in a
                  satisfactory manner. I regret that I ever encouraged the visits of this
                  exceedingly unworthy young gentleman. I considered him quite irreproachable, but
                  the wisest may err in their judgment of men. I regret too that I allowed him to
                  prejudice me against a very estimable young man, Mr. Warland," added he, walking
                  majestically forward, and extending his aristocratic hand with an air of dignified
                  self-approbation, "I make you welcome at this time and hereafter to Wood Lawn, and
                  I trust all unpleasant remembrances will be buried in oblivion."</p>
               <p>"But, Letty," cried Florence, while Marcus was receiving with due respect the
                  ostentatious but sincere <foreign xml:lang="LAT">amende honorable</foreign> of her
                  stately uncle, "I fear you have betrayed my trust. How could Pellam have
                  discovered the secret of my disguise?"</p>
               <p>"I knows that too, Miss Florence," replied the all-divining Letty, "and I'll tell
                  you all 'bout it. When we were in that strange place where Master Marcus lay sick,
                  you 'member one night how you took off your fixings just to let his father see how
                  pretty you be. Well, that night arter you come back, in your room you sat down
                  near the window, and I looked out t'other one. Says you, 'I hate to put this ugly
                  stuff on my face any more, but I must. That dear, good man, how he seemed to love
                  me, and how I love him too! Here, Letty, <hi rend="i"/>mulattofy me again.' Then I
                  fixes you up just as you was afore, and you went out, and you says, 'I wonder if
                  he will know me now.' Then I noticed that the curtain was a leetle one side, and I
                  looked out a sudden and sees a man looking right into the window, and the moment I
                  sot eyes on him, I knew it was Master Pellam, I did. I never let on a word 'bout
                  it, 'cause I know 'twould scare Miss Florence. Soon as he see me, he dart off like
                  ole snake, nobody know where. I scared almost to death for fear he tell on Miss
                  Florence. But he go off, say nothing, do nothing. I thought he all this time in
                     Texas.<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6692-00000138"/> I wish he where he ought to
                  be, and all his kin folk, that I do."</p>
               <p>"Wherever he may be," exclaimed Marcus, "retribution shall follow him."</p>
               <p>"Amen!" uttered Delaval.</p>
               <p>"Oh! he is not worthy of your resentment," cried Florence. "Surely, Marcus,
                  surely, brother, you would not condescend to wreak your vengeance on one so far
                  beneath your contempt. The man who could inflict the dastard stroke from which you
                  have so lately recovered, Marcus, should be left to the"——</p>
               <p>"Hangman's hands," interrupted Delaval. "She is right; she always is—that is,
                  sometimes."</p>
               <p>"I saw a gentleman a few days since," remarked Mr. Alston, "who met young Pellam
                  on the confines of Texas. From his account, I should think my niece was correct
                  when she observed that he was unworthy the resentment of an honourable man. He was
                  completely inebriated, and is said to be habitually subject to fits of
                  intoxication. I would advise every self-respecting young gentleman to leave him to
                  the degradation he has brought upon himself."</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Florence, "uncle is wise and just in his counsels. Let us leave him to
                  his own evil heart and baffled passions. Let us forget his very name. But how
                  shall we reward our second, or, rather, third Daniel—our modern Portia, who has
                  unravelled this web of deceit, and shown a faith in the honour of our friend that
                  shames our distrust and injustice? Letty, what can I do for you? You saved my life
                  when a child. You have restored to me a far richer boon than life. Tell me how I
                  can prove my gratitude."</p>
               <p>"By just saying nothing at all, Miss Florence," said the modern Portia. "I loves
                  you a heap better than I does myself, and I couldn't be happy, nohow, when I see
                  you the object of secret mellacly. Every night when you think Letty fast asleep,
                  she watch you all shining in the moonlight, like a suffocating angel as you was,
                  and she feel a'most willing to die, if young mistress only smile as she used to
                  long time ago."</p>
               <p>Florence laid her beautiful hand on Letty's jetty fingers, tears trembled in her
                  brilliant eyes, her bosom heaved beneath its veiling lace.</p>
               <p>"Your own heart will reward you, Letty," said she, "and mine will bless you."</p>
               <p>"Letty, you are a noble girl," cried Delaval, with enthusiasm. "You deserve to be
                  canonized. I will have a statue erected to you, and you shall be worshipped as the
                  presiding genius of distressed lovers, through all coming time."</p>
               <p>"You make fun of Letty, Master George, but no matter. It does me a power of good
                  to see you like yourself again. I don't want nothing to do with cannons, though;
                  I've no use for them."</p>
               <p>"You are a kind, excellent, and noble-hearted creature," said Marcus, grasping her
                  hand with cordial gratitude. "As I am the most of all obliged, I ought the most
                  abundantly to reward."</p>
               <p>"This nigger nothing but a fool, for all she try to make out herself be so smart,"
                  cried Letty, with an immense smile, "but I'll tell you what I do want, Master
                  Marcus, if you please; I want to see you and Miss Florence make up; that what I
                  want."</p>
               <p>"Bravo!" exclaimed Delaval, laughing, and clapping his hands. "Bravo, Letty.
                  Verily thou shalt have thy reward. Come, sister, let us all have the felicity of
                  seeing you make up with Warland, as Letty means, that is, in the good
                  old-fashioned <emph>kiss-and-be-friends</emph> sort of way."</p>
               <p>Florence, over whose face ten thousand blushing shadows were rolling, escaped from
                  the room. Marcus, who knew by intuition that she had gone to the library, soon
                  followed. There he indeed found her, in her favourite window-seat, partly shaded
                  by the well-remembered crimson curtain. She was<pb n="278-279"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000139"/> weeping, but her tears were not the night-dew of
                  sorrow; they were the drops of the morning, that turn to diamonds in the sun.</p>
               <p>"Oh, how much have I to <emph>make up</emph> to you," she cried, as she shed those
                  blissful tears on the bosom she had thought for ever estranged. "Why did I not
                  believe from the first that it was a vile forgery? Ah! it was a self-condemning
                  conscience that made me a coward and a dupe. I feel now, Marcus, that I deserved
                  to fall in your estimation, for allowing my love to triumph over the suggestions
                  of prudence and the counsels of resisting friends. Mrs. Lewis, to whom I confided
                  my plans, besought, with earnest tears, to turn me from my wild purpose, but in
                  vain. My brother was absent. I heard you were dying. The omnipotence of love
                  removed every obstacle. But, oh! I have been very rash, and, I fear now, very
                  unwomanly."</p>
               <p>"And can you think me such a cold, selfish ingrate?" exclaimed Marcus. "Yes, you
                  have been rash; for what is self-forgetfulness, self-immolation, but rashness? You
                  have been unwomanly, only to be angelic. Florence, I have admired your beauty,
                  grace, and talents more than words of mine have ever told, for my esteem has
                  always checked my admiration. I have worshipped you as L'éclair, adored you as
                  Florence, but I love you most of all as the gentle Rosa. Oh! be ever the Rosa of
                  my heart's home. Come to me with her downy touch and snowflake step, and even the
                  same twilight hue, if you will, and if the world condemn you for a love so far
                  transcending the merits that inspired it, let my lips breathe the verdict for your
                  crime, and imprisonment in my arms be the only penalty which you are doomed to
                  suffer."</p>
               <p>"I see you have <emph>made up,</emph>" said Delaval, when, some time after, he
                  entered the library, for pen, ink, and paper; his fine black eyes bright with all
                  their wonted fire. "But you have not allowed poor Letty the only boon she asked.
                  Any message to Miss Katy, Warland?" added he, as he was leaving the room.</p>
               <p>"Don't go, brother," cried Florence; "there is the table where you always write,
                  and here are eyes that love to look upon you. George, we ought to be called,
                  hereafter, the Children of the Mist."</p>
               <p>"I feel very much like a son of the morning now," said Delaval, seating himself
                  before the writing materials. "That was an unhappy allusion, however. You know who
                  was called the son of the morning, and how low he fell. Warland, my dear fellow,
                  my glorious fellow," he exclaimed, springing up, and seizing his hands in both
                  his, "if you knew how happy I am, you would not look so intolerably wretched
                  yourself. Seriously, I feel such a specific lightness of spirit, I fear I shall go
                  up in a natural balloon."</p>
               <p>"One question," said Florence, turning to Marcus, "I have forgotten to ask. How
                  did you learn the identity of the humble Rosa and the proud Florence?"</p>
               <p>A shadow came over the sunny brow of Marcus. The solemn scene of his father's
                  death-bed rose up before him, and chastened the rapture of reconciliation.</p>
               <p>"My father, Florence," he answered, "with his dying lips revealed the secret, that
                  I might be convinced of the depth and tenderness of the heart whose truth and
                  constancy I was forced to doubt. He justified you with his last, fading breath,
                  while he told me of the boundless debt my life's devotion never can repay."</p>
               <p>That was a <emph>glorious evening</emph> at Wood Lawn, as Delaval said more than
                  once. The gay laugh of Florence was heard in silvery music once more in her
                  dwelling. Her magnificent voice again accompanied the keys of her neglected
                  instrument. The flowers that had seemed scentless and dim blushed into new bloom
                  and sweetness. Every thing had the brightness and beauty of a new creation, for
                  paradise was regained in the heart. If Letty was a belle before, there was no
                  limit to her belle-ship from this period. The gratitude of those whom her shrewd
                  and active spirit had restored to happiness did not evaporate in a few words of
                  promise. They vied with each other in the<pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC6692-00000140"
                  /> number and value of their gifts, till Letty said her trunk was "nothing but a
                  show-box, sure enough." Her fame went abroad, and negroes came from distant
                  plantations, when their holidays allowed them, to see the wisdom of Letty, and
                  they went away, thinking, as Queen Sheba did of the splendidly endowed son of
                  David, that the half was left untold. She improvised one or two more verses of her
                  camp-meeting song, which she sang while dusting the parlour, and Marcus and
                  Florence sat in the piazza, within reach of her musical voice. <q>

               <p>This is the last specimen we shall give of the inspirations of our African
                  Corinna. The sudden and sunflower expansion of her genius, under the beams of
                  favouring circumstances, was truly surprising, for, though she saw no necessity of
                  linking two ideas together to make <emph>reason,</emph> she certainly had a
                  perception of measure and <emph>rhyme.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>And now the sky is all blue, and the current smooth, and the gales propitious, we
                  feel as if we ought to lay down our pen. Indeed, the sunshine is too bright—it is
                  dazzling. Where is the artist who ever attempted to paint a noonday sun?</p>
               <p>Kind and gentle reader, (for to us you have always been kind and gentle, whatever
                  name you bear,) we trust you have followed with interest the history of our
                  friends, especially that humbler class, whose characters form the under-current of
                  the work. But, as we said at the beginning, we have a higher motive than merely to
                  excite interest for the passing hour. It is to cast our mite into the great
                  treasury of truth; and if that mite be no larger than the smallest particle which
                  the coral insect leaves in forming the growing reef, it may assist in erecting a
                  barrier against the ocean-waves of ruin that threaten to lay waste our land. This
                  may end in presumption, but it began in humility. The greatness of the design
                  should never be judged by the means which are sometimes used to assist in its
                  accomplishment. In a frail bark of osiers was the future lawgiver of Israel
                  committed to the waters of the Nile, with naught but the arm of God to defend him
                  from the deadly warriors of the deep. Like the sister who stood waiting in the
                  shadow of the palm-trees, watching the destiny of the wave-cradled child, till the
                  daughter of Pharaoh came near and took him in her adopting arms, we wait the royal
                  coming of public favour, the sweeping of its purple robes, the glittering of its
                  golden crown.</p>
               <p>After the usual time consecrated to the memory of the dead, there was a splendid
                  wedding at Hickory Hill, not destined to so disastrous a termination as the
                  ill-starred Cora's. It is an astonishing fact, that Aunt Milly survived the
                  elation and excitement of the occasion. To see Miss Katy, the child of her<pb
                     n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6692-00000141"/> hopes and prayers, the mistress of such
                  a noble establishment, to say nothing of her princely spirited husband, was the
                  crown of her earthly ambition. As the still lovely and charming Mrs. Bellamy
                  looked on the sweet young bride, whom she loved with all a mother's tenderness,
                  and thought of the night when she first saw her, a poor and isolated little child,
                  she blessed God, who put it into her heart to love and cherish her, and nurture
                  her into the bloom and the beauty of womanhood.</p>
               <p>It was a moment to be remembered, when Aunt Milly bade adieu to Bellamy Place,
                  and, rolling in a carriage behind her young mistress, followed her to her new
                  home. She kept nodding her head to the negroes, as long as she could catch a
                  glimpse of the hickory trees, smiles and tears contending on her honest
                  countenance. The habit of exaggeration she had acquired at the ferryman's cabin
                  had long since died in the plenitude and luxury in which she had been living. But
                  it was owing to the purifying influence of religion, which opened her eyes to the
                  beauty of truth, and convinced her that even affection, pure as hers, could not
                  sanctify the white little lies she formerly thought it no sin to utter.</p>
               <p>Hannibal could not bid Katy good-by. He gave her a parting serenade with his
                  beloved violin, but hid himself when the hour of separation arrived. Delaval
                  endeavoured to persuade him that Letty was worthy to supplant the lost Cora in his
                  affections; but the Carthaginian General never suffered his constancy to the
                  memory of the beautiful mulatto to vary one hair's-breadth. He felt with
                  O'Connor's Child, <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Oh, what is any living love,</l>
                        <l>To that which cannot quit the dead?"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The same wedding-party soon after gathered at Wood Lawn, to grace the nuptials of
                  its beautiful mistress. And they came also from the north and the south, and the
                  east and the west, for the invitations were sent far and wide. It was a joyous and
                  magnificent festival, as well it might be, for such a bridegroom groom and such a
                  bride seldom are found among every-day mortals. It was equivalent to a double
                  wedding, for the young master and his fair-cheeked bride divided with the splendid
                  pair the hymeneal honours.</p>
               <p>Good Mrs. Lewis has not acted a prominent part in this narrative, but she
                  immortalized herself by the wedding-supper and all the accompaniments of the
                  festival. It has been said that the ladies of the South excel in the adornments of
                  a bridal fête, and it is certain that they are unsurpassed in the elegance of
                  their floral taste. This floral taste is never so gracefully exercised as in the
                  decorations of a bridal table. That which was now spread in the ample hall of Wood
                  Lawn, resembled a garden of snow glittering in the moonlight, for flowers in
                  bas-relief on a surface of dazzling white decorated the lofty pyramids of cake,
                  and sprinkled over this surface of spotless white gleamed ten thousand rays of
                  silver and gold. Real, living, blooming, aromatic flowers exhaled their perfume
                  from rich silver vases, the whole length and breadth of the table, and were
                  festooned in garlands all around the wall. Over each end of the table was
                  suspended a canopy of flowers, in honour of each bridal pair. Nothing could be
                  more graceful or beautiful than these novel decorations. They were formed of
                  several graduated hoops, entwined with evergreen and flowers, and the cords that
                  confined them together, at regular intervals, were wreathed with the same glowing
                  blossoms. As these sweet, fairy pavilions, softly, gently swaying in the
                  night-breeze, rose in floral beauty above the brides of the evening, they might
                  have been taken for two May Queens, in their coronation bowers.</p>
               <p>Aunt Milly and Letty were peeping in at the window, in the midst of many a smiling
                  black face.</p>
               <p>"I do say," cried Letty, who looked something like a bride herself, so handsome
                  and tasteful was her attire, "that Miss Florence and Master Marcus are the
                  gloriousest couple that ever was created, and the way they do love each
                     other—oh!<pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6692-00000142"/> you get along, you Letty,
                  you can't begin to speak about it! Just see her look up at him with them eyes of
                  hers. Now, who ever did see a pair of eyes that could hold a candle to'em?"</p>
               <p>"Miss Katy's can," said Aunt Milly, her family pride and affection kindling as she
                  spoke. "See, she's a looking sorter down, so modest and tender, and then she's so
                  fair and white you can hardly tell which is which, her cheek or the veil. Bless
                  her little heart, I can see it flutter about now. She couldn't speak a cross word
                  to save her life. She's like the blessed virgins that kept their hair trimmed and
                  burning, waiting for the bridegroom to come along."</p>
               <p>"She mighty pretty, but Miss Florence beat her all hollow," persisted Letty.
                     "<emph>She</emph> look spunky, that what I like to see; but she gentle as a
                  lamb for all that."</p>
               <p>They probably continued for a long time discussing the beauties and merits of the
                  two young brides, but the music of the band that came rolling out of the dancing
                  hall drowned their voices in a flood of sound. The floor of the room where the
                  dancers repaired was covered with most exquisite figures, designed in chalk, soon
                  to be effaced by the light-winged feet that skimmed over them. The whole lawn was
                  illuminated with lamps, the back-yard blazing with pine-torches, and green boughs
                  were hanging in front of every negro cabin. Many an airy couple was seen waltzing
                  on the smooth, green lawn, and the way the negroes leaped and danced about the
                  back-yard was, as Letty said, "a caution." There can be no such weddings as those
                  celebrated on the noble plantations of the South, for nowhere else do we see the
                  bright, jetty setting, that surrounds the fair pearls and diamonds, it so
                  beautifully contrasts.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alston made a characteristic speech on the occasion, accompanied by an extra
                  set of flourishes, and Delaval, just at the close of the evening, summoned Letty
                  into the hall, and told her that she must wind up with an epithalamium and a
                     <foreign xml:lang="FRA">pas seul.</foreign> It is true he was obliged to
                  explain the nature of the request, but she acquitted herself in her twofold
                  character to the astonishment and admiration of all, and disappeared in a shower
                  of silver, that fell from an invisible cloud.</p>
               <p>We thought we had bidden a last farewell to the beautiful fountain we love so
                  well. We did not know that Florence would insist upon her husband's taking her to
                  the scene of his early struggles and his father's latest rest. But she did, and
                  before he transplanted this true passion-flower to the bower he had made, he
                  carried her to the lone spot we have so often visited. He took her into the cabin,
                  where his old friend, the ferryman's wife, still presided, and who greeted them
                  with heartfelt cordiality. But the walls were no longer dark and gloomy. A pure
                  surface of white plaster greeted the eye, and the furniture and curtains presented
                  quite a modern appearance. The mistress, too, of the rejuvenated mansion
                  harmonized in her neat apparel with the improved and beautified aspect of the
                  place. The visits of Marcus to the home of his childhood had awakened in her heart
                  the love of the beautiful, and his liberality had enabled her to fit up the old
                  cabin, and convert it into a pleasant and comfortable dwelling-place. To the hand
                  that had transplanted the wild rose to the grave of Simon, and that watered the
                  flower that blossomed on his father's grassy bed, he could assign no niggard
                  boon.</p>
               <p>Marcus led Florence to the Long Moss Spring, and seated her on the snowy rock so
                  often his throne, and he watched the shadow of the magnolia and the shining holly
                  playing on her brow. They drank together of the waters, purer than Castalian dews,
                  and looked upon each other's faces in the blue mirror beneath. Then, hand in hand,
                  they knelt by the grave of Warland, and mingled their sighs with the wind that
                  whispered mournfully with the rustling grass. They bent over the spot where the
                  aged Simon slept, and plucked some of the roses that blossomed luxuriantly there.
                  Mr. Bellamy had ordered a marble tomb to the memory of his friend, but it was not
                  yet completed. Marcus was glad that Florence could see<pb n="286-287"
                     xml:id="VAC6692-00000143"/> the spot just as God had made it, with no influence
                  but that of nature's breathing into her soul.</p>
               <p>"Oh," exclaimed Florence, as he drew her reluctant steps from the fountain's side,
                  "let us build a cottage on this enchanting spot, and come and dwell in this sweet
                  and lonely paradise. <q>
                     <l>"Would this be world enough for thee?"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"No, my gentle Rosa," answered Marcus, the lofty glance of ambition flashing from
                  his eyes, and mingling with the softer radiance of love, "dearly as I love you,
                  and though I could be happy, blessed with you, were Providence to cast me on
                  Crusoe's desert isle, I should not be true to my destiny if I
                     <emph>voluntarily</emph> buried in solitude the talents God has given me to
                  glorify him in a more extended sphere. Neither would my bright and high-souled
                  L'éclair. She was formed to gladden and beautify the world, as well as to be the
                  angel of my Eden home. But we <emph>will</emph> have a cottage here, where we can
                  sometimes come and bathe our spirits in the heavenly beauty of the scene. This
                  shall be a resting-place to refresh us through the journey of life; and, oh!
                  Florence, when that pilgrimage is over, may we sleep side by side, with our buried
                  father, near the margin of the Long Moss Spring."</p>
               <p>Florence turned aside her head, to hide the tears that gathered in her eyes. Her
                  heart was too full of love and happiness, not to be chilled by the cold thought of
                  mortality. Marcus put his arm around her, and gently drew her to the river's
                  shore, where the old ferryboat lay, dark and lazy, like some old negro basking in
                  the sun. The ferryman's wife stood gazing at them from the door of the cabin.
                  Marcus beckoned to her, pointing to the poles, and she came with a quick step and
                  smiling countenance.</p>
               <p>"Will you help me once again?" he asked, unfastening the chain, and lifting
                  Florence lightly into the boat. "I must ferry her across this river of many
                  memories."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that I will, and thank you, too," answered the woman, and Florence found
                  herself floating on the dark-flowing Chattahoochee, while Marcus dashed the pole
                  into the current with all the wild grace of boyhood, combined with manhood's
                  strength.</p>
               <p>The sun went behind a cloud, and he hung his hat on the lantern-post, so that the
                  river breeze rustled freely through his magnificent locks. Florence gazed on his
                  splendid figure, in the attitude of unconscious grace it had assumed, with eyes of
                  adoration; then, moved by a sudden impulse, she stooped over the edge of the boat,
                  and dipping the water in her hand, sprinkled it laughingly over his waving
                  hair.</p>
               <p>"Ah, fairy of the fountain," he exclaimed, "that was a never-to-be-forgotten
                  baptism; and this I receive as a new consecration. Beautiful, life-giving element,
                  I welcome the purifying drops. Florence, the sweetest, dearest associations of my
                  life cluster around the welling spring. Thanks be to God for the fountain's gush
                  and the river's flow."</p>
               <p>Sweet in after-life was the remembrance of this scene. Marcus has not yet reached
                  the zenith of his fame, but like the ascending sun, it shineth brighter and
                  brighter unto the perfect day. His voice will soon be heard in our country's
                  capitol, with an eloquence powerful enough to waken its deepest echoes. His motto
                  is <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Excelsior.</foreign> His goal the highest summit of
                  human ambition; that is, the glory of God, and the good of man.</p>
               <p>And whether as the glowing lightning playing lambently on the horizon of his
                  existence, or as the waxing moon shining with increasing lustre on the rising tide
                  of his affections, or as the gentle rose shedding sweetness and beauty on his
                  heart, Florence is still the angel of his Eden home.</p>

               <p>"Mr. Robb is better known probably as 'Solitaire,' under which name he has written
                  some very broad, farcical sketches of Western manners for the
                     <title>Reveille,</title> of St. Louis. Some of the sketches in this volume are
                  spirited and cleverly written, and they are all lively and full of animal spirits;
                  but they are too brief to contain a development of character. The best sketch is
                  the story of 'Old Sugar,' which is illustrated by an exceedingly fine drawing by
                  Darley. We feel, after inspecting the designs in this book, that we have
                  heretofore underrated the comic powers of this admirable artist; there are
                  evidences in some of these designs of a very high order of genius."—<title>N. Y.

                  Osiris, into a thousand pieces, and scattered to the four winds, shall be gathered
                  limb to limb, and moulded, with every joint and member, into an immortal feature

               <p>CAREY &amp; HART, have recently published A NEW EDITION OF THE WAVERLEY NOVELS, BY
                  SIR WALTER SCOTT, With all the Author's latest Notes and Additions, Complete,
                  without the slightest Abridgment.</p>
               <p>In Five Royal 8vo. volumes, upwards of 650 Pages in each volume.</p>
               <p>CONTENTS. Waverly, Guy Mannering, Antiquary, Rob Roy, Black Dwarf, Old Mortality,
                  Heart of Mid-Lothian, Bride of Lammermoor, Legend of Montrose, Ivanhoe, The
                  Monastery, The Abbot, Kentworth, The Pirate, Fortunes of Nigel, Peveril of the

               <p>The object of the publishers in thus reducing the price of the Waverley Novels, is
                  to endeavor to give them a greatly extended circulation, and they have, therefore,
                  put them at a price which brings them within the reach of every family in the
                  country. There is <emph>now</emph> no fireside that need be without a set of the
                  most charming works of fiction ever issued from the press: for there is no one
                  that can't afford two dollars and a half—TWO DOLLARS AND A HALF for twenty-five of
                  Sir Walter Scott's Novels! ten cents for a complete Novel!! ten cents for
                  "Ivanhoe," which was originally published at a guinea and a half!!! It seems
                  impossible, and yet it is true. In no other way can the same amount of amusement
                  and instruction be obtained for ten times the money, for the Waverley Novels alone
                  form a Library.</p>
               <p>The publishers wish it to be distinctly understood, that, while the price is so
                  greatly reduced the work is in no way abridged, but is CAREFULLY PRINTED FROM, AND
                  CONTAINS EVERY WORD IN THE LAST EDINBURGH EDITION, in forty-eight volumes, which
                  sells for seventy-two dollars.</p>
               <p>Now is the time to buy! Such an opportunity may never again occur. Let every one,
                  then, who wants the <emph>Waverley Novels for two dollars and a half, now
                     purchase,</emph> for if the publishers do not find the sale greatly increased,
                  by the immense reduction in price, they will resume the old price of twenty-five
                  cents for each Novel, which <emph>was</emph> considered wonderfully cheap.</p>

               <head>THE Prose Writers of Germany.</head>
               <p>BY F. H. HEDGE. ILLUSTRATED WITH PORTRAITS.</p>
               <p>The work mentioned above comprises a list of the most eminent writers of Germany,
                  together with copious extracts from their works, beginning with LUTHER and
                  reaching up to the present time. For those who are interested in the literature of
                  Germany, it presents a valuable aid in becoming more intimately acquainted with
                  the German mind; and even to the curious it offers an excitement which will grow
                  stronger in proportion as their taste is cultivated.</p>
               <p>In the present volume we find valuable extracts, given from their prose writings.
                  Although the writers follow in chronological order, and LUTHER stands at the head
                  of his intellectual brethren, the longest space is allowed to those who claim our
                  greatest attention; and GOETHE therefore occupies the most conspicuous position
                  both in the specimens given and the selection of the pieces. GOETHE is a writer
                  who requires most of all to be studied; while others, as SCHILLER, in his
                  passionate mood and ideal longings, requires no silent and incessant reflection,
                  because he works his effects immediately by rousing the depth of our nature. Next
                  to GOETHE, SCHILLER appears in an article upon Naïve and Sentimental Poetry, a
                  bold effort of him, the success of which is however yet very disputed, to classify
                  every produce of Art according to the impressions made upon the reader, and to
                  dispense with the various and cumbersome forms of the departments into which we
                  have been accustomed hitherto to arrange all subjects bearing upon poetry. The
                  department upon which SCHILLER enters here, belongs properly to the philosophy of
                  Art; to the aesthetics, the investigation of the beautiful.</p>
               <p>Foremost stands LESSING, the first critic of his time. Next to him comes HERDER, a
                  devout philosopher, and a clear-sighted intellect, with the eyes of a child;
                  curious to penetrate the maze and noisy market of the world, the variegated life
                  among the ancients and the moderns in search for that beautiful humanity which he
                  had sketched in his own mind, and which he would fain proclaim the order of an
                  otherwise mysterious providence. The two brothers SCHLEGEL—William, the noble
                  interpreter and translator of Shakspeare, and Frederic, known best by his
                  investigations of the language and wisdom of the Indians—follow him, and MOSES
                  MENDELSSOHN, a Jewish philosopher, closes the series of these writers. The
                  treatise of the latter on the Sublime and Naïve will be read with interest by
                  everybody who has only an ordinary reading of ancient and modern poetry. Distinct
                  from all the rest stand WIELAND and JEAN PAUL RICHTER, best known in this country
                  by the appellation of JEAN PAUL.</p>

               <head>OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.</head>
               <p>"THE book is a noble defence of Marie Antoinette against the many calumnies
                  breathed against her. Moreover, as a picture of manners during the latter years of
                  Louis XV., and the entire reign of his successor, it has no superior; it is at
                  once more decent and more veracious than the 'Life of Dubarry,' and the thousand
                  other garbled memoirs of that period. A large number of notes, explanatory and
                  otherwise, accompany the volume, and add materially to its value. Mr. Hart has
                  published the book in a style of great elegance, and illustrated it with
                  portraits, on steel, of Marie Antoinette and Madame Elizabeth. It is a book that
                  should find a place on every lady's centre-table."—<title>Neal's Gazette.</title>

                  position of the author at the court of Louis XVI. gave her extraordinary
                  opportunities for looking behind the scenes for the causes of much that was
                  entirely inexplicable to the public. Indeed, there can be no question of her
                  knowledge, while of her truthfulness, as far as she goes, there is abundant
                  evidence in the volumes themselves. We cannot believe Marie Antoinette to have
                  been as immaculate as she is painted by Madame Campan. Young, giddy, inexperienced
                  and wilful, she was cast headlong into the most profligate court of Christendom.
                  Surrounded by pleasures and temptations, amid a set of beings to whom gallantry
                  was so habitual that it ceased to be remarked—with an impotent husband, and with
                  all around him corrupt, venal, and licentious, we cannot believe that all the

               <p>"It may now be asked by some sapient critics, Why make all this coil about a mere
                  periodical essayist? Of what possible concern is it to any body, whether Mr.
                  Thomas Babington Macaulay be, or be not, overrun with faults, since he is nothing
                  more than one of the three-day immortals who contribute flashy and 'taking'
                  articles to a Quarterly Review? What great work has he written? Such questions as
                  these might be put by the same men who place the Spectator, Tattler and Rambler
                  among the British classics, yet judge of the size of a cotemporarv's mind by that
                  of his book, and who can hardly recognize amplitude of comprehension, unless it be
                  spread over the six hundred pages of octavos and quartos.—<pb

                  men would place Bancroft above Webster, and Sparks above Calhoun, Adams and
                  Everett—deny a posterity for Bryant's Thanatopsis, and predict longevity to
                  Pollok's Course of Time. It is singular that the sagacity which can detect thought

                  it can easily be demonstrated that Macaulay's writings contain a hundred-fold more

               <p>In One Volume 8vo., with a Portrait.</p>
               <p>From a very able article in the North British Review we extract the following:</p>
               <p>"It is a book not to be read only—but studied—it is a vast repository; or rather a
                  system or institute, embracing the whole circle of letters—if we except the exact
                  sciences—and contains within itself, not in a desultory form, but in a well
                  digested scheme, more original conceptions, bold and fearless speculation and just
                  reasoning on all kinds and varieties of subjects than are to be found in any
                  English writer with whom we are acquainted within the present or the last
                  generation. * * * His choice of words is unbounded and his felicity of expression,
                  to the most impalpable shade of discrimination, almost miraculous. Playful,
                  lively, and full of illustration, no subject is so dull or so dry that he cannot
                  invest it with interest, and none so trifling that it cannot acquire dignity or
                  elegance from his pencil. Independently however, of mere style, and apart from the
                  great variety of subjects embraced by his pen, the distinguishing feature of his
                  writings, and that in which he excels his cotemporary reviewers, is the deep vein
                  of practical thought which runs throughout them all"</p>

                  vivacity, like the bubbling up of a natural fountain. In her almost childish
                  playful ness, she reminds us of that exquisite creation of Fouque, Undine, who
                  knew no law but that of her own waywardness. The great charm of her poetry is its
                  unaffected simplicity. It is the transparent simplicity of truth, reflecting the

                  the works. Her spontaneous and instinctive effusions appear, in a higher degree
                  than any others in our literature, to combine the rarest and highest capacities in
                  art with the sincerest and deepest sentiments and the noblest aspirations. They
                  would convince us, if the beauty of her life were otherwise unknown, that Mrs.

               <p>"The position of Mrs. Osgood, as a graceful and womanly poetess, is fixed, and
                  will be enduring. To taste of faultless delicacy, a remarkable command of poetical
                  language, great variety of cadence, and a most musical versification, she has
                  added recently the highest qualities of inspiration, imagination, and passion, in
                  a degree rarely equalled in the productions of women.... The reputation which Mrs.
                  Osgood enjoys, as one of the most amiable, true-hearted, and brilliant ladies in
                  American society, will add to the good fortune of a book, the intrinsic excellence

               <head>WASHINGTON AND THE GENERALS OF THE REVOLUTION.</head>
               <head type="sub">BY VARIOUS EMINENT AUTHORS.</head>
               <p>Now ready, in 1 vol. post 8vo., price $1.25, with Portraits,</p>
               <p>CONTAINING Biographical Sketches of all the Major and Brigadier Generals who acted
                  under commissions from Congress during the Revolutionary War.</p>
               <p>WE hail these beautiful volumes with undisguised delight. They supply, in a
                  dignified and comprehensive form, valuable information, which will be sought with
                  avidity, not only by the American public, but by the world at large. The want of a
                  work of <emph>positive authority</emph> on this subject has long been felt and
                  deplored. The enterprise and good taste of Messrs. Carey and Hart have given us
                  two handsome and reliable volumes, betraying industry and talent, and replete with
                  facts of the deepest interest. There is no idle romancing—no school-boy attempts
                  at rhetorical display; on the contrary, the work is written in a clear,
                  unaffected, business-like, yet beautiful manner. The authors had the good sense to
                  think that the stirring events of "the times that tried men's souls," needed no
                  embellishment. It is a complete, impartial, and well written history of the
                  American Revolution, and, at the same time, a faithful biography of the most
                  distinguished actors in that great struggle, whose memories are enshrined in our
                  hearts. The typographical execution of the work is excellent, and the sixteen
                  portraits on steel are remarkably well done. The first volume is embellished with
                  a life-like portrait of Washington mounted on his charger, from Sully's picture,
                     "<title>Quelling the Whisky Riots.</title>" This is, we believe, the first
                  engraving taken from it. There are biographies of <emph>eighty-eight
                     Generals,</emph> beginning with "the Father of his country," and closing with
                  General Maxwell. To accomplish this task, we are assured that "the accessible
                  published and unpublished memoirs, correspondence, and other materials relating to
                  the period, have been carefully examined and faithfully reflected." We earnestly
                  commend this work. It will be found an unerring record of the most interesting
                  portion of our history.—<title>The City Item.</title>
               </p>
               <p>This work differs from Mr. Headley's, having nearly the same title, in many
                  important particulars; and <emph>as an historical book is much
                     superior.</emph>—<title>N. Y. Com. Advertiser.</title>
               </p>
               <p>Certainly the most comprehensive and individualized work that has ever been
                  published on the subject—each member of the great <foreign xml:lang="LAT">dramatis
                     personæ</foreign> of the Revolutionary tragedy, standing out in bold and
                  "sculptured" relief, on his own glorious deeds.—<title>Saturday Courier.</title>
               </p>
               <p>This work is a very different affair from the flashy and superficial book of the
                  Rev. J. T. Headley, entitled "Washington and the Generals." It appears without the
                  name of any author, because it is the joint production of many of the most eminent
                  writers in the country, resident in various states in the Union, and having, from
                  the circumstance, access to original materials in private hands, and to public
                  archives not accessible to any one individual without long journey and much
                  consumption of time. The result, however, is a complete and authentic work,
                  embracing biographical notices of every one of the Revolutionary Generals. The
                  amount of fresh and original matter thus brought together in these moderate-sized
                  volumes, is not less surprising than it is gratifying to the historical reader.
                  This will become a standard book of reference, and will maintain its place in
                  libraries long after the present generation shall have enjoyed the gratification
                  of perusing its interesting pages, exhibiting in a lively style the personal
                  adventures and private characters of the sturdy defenders of American
                     Independence.—<title>Scott's Weekly Newspaper.</title>
               </p>
               <p>The author's name is not given, and from what we have read, we presume that
                  various pens have been employed in these interesting biographies. This is no
                  disadvantage, but, on the contrary, a decided benefit, for it insures greater
                  accuracy than could be looked for in such a series of biographies written by one
                  person in a few months. The volumes are published in a very handsome style. The
                  first sixty pages are occupied with the biography of Washington, which is written
                  with force and elegance, and illustrated by an original view of the character of
                  that great man. * * * The number of the biographies in these volumes is much
                  greater than that of Mr. Headley's work. There are eighty-eight distinct
                     subjects.—<title>N. Y. Mirror.</title>
               </p>
               <p>We have read a number of the articles, find them to be written with ability, and
                  to possess a deep interest. The author has manifested excellent judgment in
                  avoiding all ambitious attempts at what is styled <emph>fine writing;</emph> but
                  gives a connected recital of the important events in the lives of his heroes. The
                  work will be highly interesting and valuable to all readers—particularly so to
                  youth, who are a ways attracted by biographies. If a father wishes to present to
                  his sons noble instances of uncorrupted and incorruptible patriotism, let him
                  place this work in their hands. It should have a place in every American library,
                  and is among the most valuable books of the season.—<title>Baltimore

                  without a copy of this invaluable contribution to our early American history." "It
                  seems to convey us back to other times—we see things as they were—<emph>minutely

               <p>"This is a practical age, and it demands practical books. Of this class is the
                  manual before us, addressing itself to a rapidly growing interest among us, and
                  one, upon the prosperity of which depends, in a great measure, the destiny of the
                  South. We have too long committed the fatal error of allowing Northern
                  manufactories to convert our staple into the fabrics we require for use, losing by
                  the process all the expenses of a double transportation, the profits of
                  manufacturing, and sundry incidental costs of interest and exchange. With the
                  increasing attention to manufactures in the South, arises the need of information
                  upon all their appliances and workings, and much that is valuable of this nature
                  is found in the book before us. Mr. Baird was an expert and successful
                  cotton-spinner. His experience and observations are here afforded to his
                  fellow-operatives, combined with the modern improvements in mechanics and methods.
                  No intelligent man at the present day builds without 'counting the cost,' or
                  enters upon a field of labour without a comprehensive knowledge of its
                  capabilities and requirements. To those proposing to erect small factories, or now
                  conducting them, the treatise before us could not fail to be of service, if well
                  studied, and to such we commend it."—<title>Southern Literary Gazette.</title>

                  Baird, well known as an expert cotton-spinner. It is gratifying to see that so

                  this kind, for we believe that our operatives should possess a theoretical as well

                  first cotton-mill was erected in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. In 1850 the number of
                  spindles in operation was computed at 2,500,000.' These facts are among the most

               <p>"Here is something which looks like a system of horsemanship. We have often
                  lamented over the wrongs done to horses, and wondered if there were no better
                  means of conveying our wishes to the animals than by brutally belabouring them
                  with a whip. Baucher's method has one great merit; it is humane. His instructions
                  are conveyed by a series of gentle checks and impulses, which so far from tiring
                  the horse, only tend to bring out his latent powers and better instincts, through
                  an intelligent course of exercise. Baucher's method has proved highly successful
                  in France, not only with the trick-horses of the ring and the gentleman's hackney,
                  but with the cavalry of the army. It has also been extensively adopted in the
                  Prussian service; and Baucher received a diamond snuff-box, and other marks of
                  favour, from the King of Prussia, together with many commendatory letters from the
                  officers of his army. We understand, from the translator's preface, that all the
                  astonishment which we bestowed on Gen. Welch's horse 'May-fly,' Madame Loyo and
                  her stud, was due to the instructions of Baucher. No further proofs are needed of
                  the practical workings of a system which can perform such wonders with horses. The
                  present translation is finely gotten up, and contains many neat illustrative
                  engravings. The translator's part appears to be well and carefully done, while its
                  value is increased by a number of original notes, explaining the technical meaning
                  of the French stable-terms. A book on a subject so interesting to equestrians
                  cannot fail to be popular."—<title>Inquirer.</title>

               <p>"This work is certainly calculated to produce a sensation among those 'whose talk
                  is of horses.' It is singular that the present should be the first English
                  translation of a work which has passed through nine editions in Paris, has been
                  reprinted again and again in Belgium, and has been translated into both Dutch and
                  German. Of the great value of Baucher's system no one, who has given it attention,
                  can have a reasonable doubt. Its great merit is that it can properly be called a
                  system based upon admitted principles—not a collection of unphilosophical
                  rules—and that it is capable of the most extended development. Even Baucher, a man
                  of no common vanity, confesses that by pursuing his method, the horse's education
                  may be carried far beyond any result which he has yet obtained. Further
                  developments would indeed be profitable to the circus, and curious to the
                  naturalist, as proving the extent of the animal's sagacity, under a proper plan of

               <head>Anne Boleyn: A Tragedy.</head>
               <p>BY GEORGE H. BOKER, Author of Calaynos, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>COMPLETE IN ONE VOL. 12MO., SCARLET CLOTH.</p>
               <p>PRICE 75 CENTS.</p>
               <p>"On a former occasion we spoke in high terms of the tragedy of Calaynos, and our
                  judgment has been affirmed by some of the ablest critics of England and America.
                  In the former country, it was put upon the stage and met with distinguished
                  approval. This is a compliment of which the young author has just cause to feel
                  proud. But the tragedy of Calaynos, though ably written, and abounding with
                  passages of thrilling interest, will never enjoy the measure of popularity to
                  which 'Anne Boleyn' is destined."—<title>City Item.</title>
               </p>
               <p>"The tragedy of 'Anne Boleyn' is, in very essence, a stage play—full of incident
                  and replete with brilliant dialogue. The individuality of character, throughout,
                  is admirably sustained. From the very first scene, which introduces Norfolk on the
                  stage, we become interested in the plot, and so continue to the sad dénouement of
                  this tragic history. Henry VIII., though somewhat in a new dress, is in perfect
                  relevance with history. Thomas Wyatt is beautifully imbodied in Mr. Boker's just
                  and fine appreciation of this celebrated gentleman and poet. Queen Anne is the
                  principal character, and skilfully drawn. The exquisite tenderness of her language
                  and the dignity of her grief touch us with that probe which reaches the heart
                  through the admiration. We were struck with the great force and personification of
                  her character, and secretly indulged the hope that the time might come when we
                  should see it enacted by the peerless representative of Shakspeare's heroines—MRS.
                  FRANCES ANNE KEMBLE."—<title>Drawing-Room Journal.</title>

                  congratulating the author, not on the laurels it is sure to win him, but on the
                  joy and enlargement he must have received in its creation, and on the reaction

               <p>"'Anne Boleyn' is better than 'Calaynos,' both positively and relatively:
                  positively, because it is of a bolder and wider range, and evinces more artistic
                  skill; relatively, because notwithstanding it is subsequent to 'Calaynos,' and
                  therefore was expected to surpass it, its excellence is even greater than this
                  circumstance required. In the past year, Mr. Boker's mind has made a vast stride.
                  He has gained confidence in himself; his range of thought has widened and
                  deepened; and he has acquired alike greater dramatic strength and a finer
                  perception of the poetical. The present tragedy is founded on the melancholy story
                  of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry the Eighth. The principal characters are
                  the King, the Duke of Norfolk, the Queen, her rival Jane Seymour, Wyatt the poet,
                  Wyatt's sister, Lord Rochford, and Mark Smeaton: and the action of the play
                  embraces the interval between the commencement of the King's passion for Jane
                  Seymour, and the execution of Anne Boleyn. In depicting the characters, as well as
                  in narrating the incidents of his drama, Mr. Boker has adhered mainly to history;
                  and in this displayed his good sense; for the closing career of Anne Boleyn is a
                  drama in real life. Henry the Eighth, Jane Seymour, Norfolk, and Wyatt are drawn
                  with equal truth and power."—<title>Evening Bulletin.</title>

               <p>"In originality of conception, terseness, vigour, and melodiousness of diction,
                  novelty of imagery, keenness of satire, and purity and elevation of sentiment,
                  this work will bear comparison with the best poems in the English language. We
                  hazard the opinion that posterity will place it by the side of the best of Byron's
                  poetic tales. The author's skill in the analysis of character is well exhibited in
                  his sketches of the Duke of Wellington, Sir Robert Peel, O'Connell, and others.

                  our table. He is one of the few Americans who write with care. He is, moreover, a
                  townsman. And, withal, he possesses the poetic faculty in a very high degree, and
                  is destined to go down to future times crowned with 'immortal bays.' Indeed, in
                  many respects, Mr. Boker has no living rival.</p>
               <p>"The principal poem in the volume before us is 'The Podesta's Daughter,' a
                  dramatic sketch of rare merit. In compositions of this character, Mr. Boker
                  excels; but he never published any thing superior, or, in some praticulars, even
                  equal to this. The story is that of two lovers, who, from being children together,
                  become finally passionately attached. But while the youth is heir to a haughty
                  lineage, the maiden is the humble daughter of the podesta, a disparity of rank
                  that affords the author material out of which to weave his touching tragedy. The
                  delicate skill with which the two principal characters are contrasted, is worthy
                  of all praise.</p>

                  thought, its chastened style, the fire of some passages, the sweetness of others,
                  and last, but not least, the lofty ideal of womanhood which prevails throughout,

               <head>MEMOIRS OF THE Life of Mary, Queen of Scots,</head>
               <p>With Anecdotes of the Court of Henry II., during her residence in France.</p>
               <p>BY MISS BENGER, Author of Memoirs of "Anne Boleyn," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>FROM THE SECOND LONDON EDITION.</p>
               <p>Two Volumes, cloth, extra gilt, price $2.</p>
               <p>"From very flattering reviews of this work, that have appeared in English
                  publications, and a perusal of the eventful life of Anne Boleyn, we had
                  anticipated a very agreeable treat, and our expectations have been more than
                  realized. Miss Benger has a most happy faculty of condensing historical
                  information, and while occupied in portraying the events of Mary's career, gives
                  the reader a bird's-eye glance at those institutions and laws which contributed,
                  while a resident in France, to the formation of her character, and at the same
                  time introduces on the stage the prominent actors, whose influence or example may
                  have had an influence over her. Her description of the Court of Henry II. cannot
                  fail to interest the reader, for she descends at times to details, which possess
                  all the attractions of romance, but which are strictly historical. An objection
                  may be urged to her copious notes, many of which might have been incorporated in
                  the text, without injury, but her desire probably to authenticate every fact of
                  any importance, has been the cause of this, and by the critical reader will be
                  deemed as essential. No lengthy review of this work is necessary to insure it a
                  perusal from our readers, for no reader of history can fail to take a deep
                  interest in the unfortunate Mary; and our friends, who are preparing volumes for
                  winter evening perusal, will find these every way worthy their

                  who has been so much written and talked of as Mary Stuart; but Miss Benger, while
                  she has obtained many new particulars, has made the best use of the old materials,
                  and thus given us a most graceful and interesting version of one of the most
