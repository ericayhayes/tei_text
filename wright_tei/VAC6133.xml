               <p>I WAS moodily looking on two concise notes, written by the same fair hand, when
                  two lines from Meg Merrilies' incantation entered my mind; and, twisting the
                  scented notes together, I lit them with a match, and threw them into the grate,
                  humming, fiercely,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Twist ye! twine ye! even so,</l>
                        <l>Mingled shades of joy and woe!"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>One of them was a written acceptance of me for better or worse, and the other
                  dismissed me forever, as worse only.</p>
               <p>The writer and myself had become so accustomed to each other's sallies, bantering,
                  and repartee during the early part of our acquaintance, we were hopeless of
                  understanding each other's real feelings by word or look, and were, therefore,
                  compelled to pen any words of serious import, in order to make them worthy of the
                  attention due to truth. Though, when face to face, we would<pb n="6-7"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000004"/> say more in a day than we "would stand to in a
                  month," yet when anything was set down in black and white each one knew the other
                  would abide by it at any risk or expense.</p>
               <p>Therefore, when I was determined to end an uncertainty that made Sarah Carroll
                  sometimes my beloved and sometimes another's, I wrote to that effect, or else she
                  would not have believed that we must have a formal betrothal within two days, or
                  see each other no more; and when she desired me to understand that our love-life
                  was at an end, she wrote my sentence, fearing I would not have taken it from her
                  lips. As friends we would have endured for life, and blessed each other with our
                  sympathy, but in love we failed each other, and when we found we could not be all
                  that we should be in our new characters, it was too late to be contented with a
                  weaker bond.</p>
               <p>Having seen the blue-and-white flame of the notes curl and twine to my
                  satisfaction, I took up another, and read it over and over to drift my thoughts
                  from the troubles it was the innocent cause of, to those it contained in itself.
                  It was a metaphysical application of the homœopathic theory, checking sorrow by
                  sorrow; for the letter was written by my sister, informing me of the death of the
                  heroine of my school-days, and inviting me, in her mother's name, to be present at
                  the funeral. It had arrived too late to enable me to attend, as I received it the
                  day the funeral took place; but, as the next best thing I could do to show my
                  respect for her memory, I postponed going to a concert with Sarah that same
                  evening.</p>
               <p>I sat at home, thinking of my boyhood's first love, and all the childish dreams
                  and petty cares which attended it, and moralizing on the uncertainty of life and
                  the vanity of earthly schemes, while I sent a note to Sarah, saying that I could
                  not, without violence to my own feelings, and disrespect to the living and the
                  dead, be present at an evening's entertainment the day a true and tried young
                  friend was being laid into her silent grave.</p>
               <p>As the concert was to be repeated, I proposed extending the engagement to the next
                  one; but that, as I expected, did not meet the case. She had never heard me speak
                  of a female acquaintance, and was unreasonably jealous when she heard I had one
                  whose death would grieve me, and therefore she replied, excusing my escort
                  altogether.</p>
               <p>Though the term "true and tried young friend" was rather strained, as I do not
                  suppose the deceased thought six times of me in as many years, and she had never
                  been tried at school without being found wanting, yet I looked upon myself as a
                  martyr to friendship when I read Sarah's cold letter, and prepared my mind for any
                  consequences that would follow, with a morbid feeling of indifference.</p>
               <p>Next day I called in person to make an apology, and, notwithstanding the smiles of
                  welcome that greeted me, I could see by the red spots on either cheek that I had
                  fully aroused her resentment.</p>
               <pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC6133-00000005"/>
               <p>As soon as I was seated I began by saying,—</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry that I disappointed you, Sarah; but you must come to the next
                  one, which will doubtless be just as good."</p>
               <p>"Oh, I beg of you to forget it; I was not at all disappointed; but before I make
                  another engagement with you I would like to be informed how many 'true and tried
                  young friends' you have whose death might interfere with it," she said, with a
                  meek smile that was always used to mask the ugliness of her temper.</p>
               <p>"Several! every friend I have, Sarah! I love them all too well to hear their
                  requiem in a concert-hall!" I exclaimed, hurt at hearing what I considered a slur
                  on the innocent girl who had just been buried, and also at hearing my own words
                  which I knew were affected, quoted back to me with so much sarcasm.</p>
               <p>"Then I will not risk another, lest an epidemic should break out among them," she
                  said, with the same provoking, hard smile.</p>
               <p>I must not pretend that I was a submissive lover, or that I would overlook or
                  smile at anything, while courting, which I would resent when married; and my looks
                  did not help to restore peace.</p>
               <p>I did not speak until I could command my voice as easily as she did, and then I
                  said,—</p>
               <p>"I had better go now, and call again when we both feel more amiable; for if we
                  suffer this cold-blooded warfare to proceed much further, there will be an end to
                  our friendship."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no! nothing can prevent you and I from being <emph>friends, Mr.
                     Pearson,</emph> and the very best of <emph>friends;</emph> but, if you have
                  other engagements, do not let me detain you, sir," she replied, with a polished
                  evenness of modulation that was irritating when the meaning of her words was so
                  hostile, and emphasizing friends and Mr. Pearson to convey to my mind the thought
                  that we could never more be more than <emph>friends</emph> to each other.</p>
               <p>"Amen, with all my heart; let us be friends, or anything else that will end this
                  bickering life we have lived, Sarah," I said, bowing myself out, and vainly
                  endeavoring to return the calm assuring smile that followed me to the door.</p>
               <p>Next day a polite letter was handed to me, which ended with a hope that we would
                  ever be friends, and remember the pleasant hours we had spent in each other's
                  society to the end of our lives, however far apart destiny should diverge our
                  paths.</p>
               <p>Such was the end of our love-life, about one year from the time it had begun; and
                  I could hardly realize, as the flame died away and left only the black remains of
                  the two notes covered with slate-colored hieroglyphs, that so many promises and
                  hopes as were twined in that life lay there, twisting and twining in the ashes, as
                  if my lines from Meg Merrilies had bewitched them. As they finally flew up the
                  chimney, my mind was carried back to the first impressions I had formed of her
                  character, and I wished I had saved the words and thoughts that followed close on
                  our first acquaintance for<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC6133-00000006"/> the one
                  destined by Providence to be my wife, by never letting these first impressions be
                  effaced. "You must not judge by appearances," is a much abused maxim; being laid
                  down so often to us in our youth that it is a wonder we ever afterwards believe
                  the evidence of our eyes, or that some of our courts will admit sight as evidence;
                  but if I had retained the thoughts I judged by Sarah's appearance when I first saw
                  her, and not let myself be charmed out of them by the brilliancy of her wit and
                  beauty, I would have been better by many a night's careless rest, and many a
                  friend neglected for her sake.</p>
               <p>But the very stars conspired to mislead me; for before I was deeper than my ankles
                  in love our attention was caught by a meteor shooting across the heavens one
                  evening as we were out walking, and bantering in a way that approached the abuse
                  of our most sacred and serious feelings.</p>
               <p>"Wish! wish, while that star is falling, and you will get your wish!" exclaimed
                  Sarah, pointing to it with the hand she had withdrawn from my arm.</p>
               <p>"Well, I wished for something. Did you?" I asked, after the meteor had
                  vanished.</p>
               <p>"Yes! What did you wish for?" she asked, coaxingly.</p>
               <p>"Tell me what you wished for first, and then I will tell you," I said, to get
                  time; for I had not wished at all, the movement was so rapid.</p>
               <p>"Oh, with a gallant beau by her side a lady can want for nothing, so I merely
                  wished that you might get your wish," she replied.</p>
               <p>There was so much cunningness and skill displayed in her pleasant acting of
                  happiness and generosity, I was no longer at a loss for a wish, and I hurriedly
                  replied, as if afraid the thought would escape me, or discretion would hold back
                  the words,—</p>
               <p>"That was very good of you, and I think that must have been my lucky star; for it
                  is in your power to grant the wish, Sarah," I said, recovering her hand.</p>
               <p>"Well, what was it, then?" she asked, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"I wished that you might love me half as much as I love you. Will you grant it?" I
                  asked.</p>
               <p>There was a pressure on my arm in appreciation of my ready speech, but otherwise
                  she was not the one to be surprised into the betrayal of any weakness or feeling;
                  so she merely chided me for the moderation of my wish, since I might have just as
                  cheaply wished for a great deal more.</p>
               <p>"But half as much as I love you is a great deal to begin with, Sarah," I said,
                  with a gravity that ought to have choked me, considering how big a lie I concealed
                  in it; and then, after a little more bantering, she said she would grant it,
                  seeing that I was contented with so little.</p>
               <p>Thus our flirting began in earnest; for she so often denied and acknowledged the
                  binding of her word, that our courtship was no better than flirting,<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000007"/> until I at length insisted on having her promise in
                  writing.</p>
               <p>Only the first and last of the many letters of our love-correspondence were
                  burned; and to complete the work I took all that came between those two from my
                  writing-desk, where they had been filed with counting-house precision, and,
                  twisting them all by twos, burned them, repeating Meg Merrilies' lines over and
                  over, while I touched them off with lucifer matches.</p>
               <p>As there was to be no return of anything, such as usually follows a sentimental
                  quarrel, but each one left the other to dispose of them according to taste, I made
                  a dramatic display over my share that proved how little heart was ever in the
                  engagement.</p>
               <p>As I came to the last of her letters I found some written to me by the one who was
                  now dead, and began to read them to divert my mind from the work of destruction I
                  had now completed. From the polished non-committal notes of a city belle to the
                  hasty compositions of a twelve-year-old school-girl was a change that was
                  interesting; and if they gave me pleasure at the age of twenty-four, they must
                  have caused my cap to fly up with boyish glee and enthusiasm at the age of
                  fourteen. The first one, containing several blots, announced the startling
                  intelligence that <emph>Willy Manville had proposed to carry her books home from
                     school for her,</emph> and my brow must have darkened with wrath against Willy,
                  as I read it first; but then I must have sent my cap to the ceiling with a three
                  times three for Mary, as she added that she replied <emph>she could carry them
                     herself, as she was as strong as he was.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>I read the few letters she sent me after that one, and thought of the boyish
                  effusions I sent her in return during the first six months, and then of the
                  occasional visits I paid my native town, until I had almost persuaded my heart
                  that it was Mary and not Sarah it had lost.</p>
               <p>So earnest was I in my determination to drive the memory of my broken engagement
                  from my mind, I tried to think myself bereaved by the death of my betrothed bride;
                  though I was conscious that she did not long hold out against Willy Manville's
                  attack, and that, as she had been engaged to him before she died, I lost nothing
                  but a schoolmate by her death.</p>
               <p>But the feeling continued, and grew for a week, until I thought of the cold clay
                  settling around the form that I loved, with an intensity that left me indifferent
                  to every other care, and I looked into the grave as the place where my hopes were
                  buried, and read "Gray's Elegy" and "Young's Night Thoughts" until Narcissa seemed
                  a bride that Death had taken from me.</p>
               <p>When I could sustain the delusion no longer, and my bubble grief had burst, I was
                  totally in different to the real loss I had sustained, and Sarah was as a stranger
                  to my mind.</p>
               <p>Though this was the first writing of dismissal I had received from Sarah, it must
                  not be understood<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC6133-00000008"/> stood that it was the
                  first time I had been dismissed by her; for our quarrels had been frequent, and
                  often led to temporary estrangements, as the following extract from a letter will
                  show:</p>
               <p>"My duties to other friends were neglected for more than a week, that I might copy
                  the 'Culprit Fay' for Sarah, who had declared to me that she could not read it
                  with any satisfaction in print, as the witchery of the tale was lost in the prosy
                  type of the book.</p>
               <p>"The care and patience I had bestowed in writing and punctuating it, that I might
                  make it as presentable as possible, led me to anticipate a tender scene at the
                  presentation. With the full assurance of her thanks, I walked toward her house,
                  repeating in my mind, 'If receiving gives you as much pleasure as I receive in
                  giving, it is all I ask,' which little speech I had composed to be in readiness
                  the moment the first word of thanks had escaped from her lips. She is very fond of
                  complimentary speeches and ready retorts; and this was not the first time I had
                  formed a polite sentence and held it in reserve for a proper occasion.</p>
               <p>"Alas! how my fond hopes vanished all, when, with a look of surprise, she
                  exclaimed, 'Well, what a goose you are to waste your energies in transcribing a
                  poem like that from plain print into a business hand that destroys its romance,
                  and would ruin my eyes and wrinkle my brows to decipher it!'</p>
               <p>"'Rather than such a heart-rending catastrophe should happen, Sarah, I will remove
                  it from your hands, and preserve the beauty of the eyes and brows that would
                  become a diadem,' I replied, taking the manuscript from her hands before she was
                  aware of it, placing it on a chair, and seating myself securely upon it.</p>
               <p>"She was slightly taken aback by such a peremptory movement, but instantly
                  rallied, and said, with coquettish indifference,—</p>
               <p>"'What was your object in writing it, pray? Some lady asked you, to try your
                  patience, and in your weariness you dreamed that it was I! Won't she feel
                  complimented, though, when she learns the mistake you have made in bringing it up
                  here to me?'</p>
               <p>"'Not more than I feel, after having banished myself from court for a week, that
                  the task might be completed before I returned,' I replied.</p>
               <p>"'Oh! I beg pardon, Sir Knight; and since it is such a task for you to do me a
                  favor, I cannot do otherwise than appreciate it. Welcome back to court!' she
                  exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"'No; I do not wish you to appreciate it for the pains I have taken with it, and I
                  do not think you will for the trouble you will have in getting it from me,' I
                  returned, sullenly.</p>
               <p>"'Philosophy says we prize everything in proportion to the labor we employ in
                  securing it,' she said, with a mischievous expression that I well understood.</p>
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6133-00000009"/>
               <p>"'That is poor philosophy! The pains we take to secure a prize only proves how
                  much we think it is worth, or how much we desire to keep others from getting it;
                  and when we have it, the question will surely come up, Is it worth what it has
                  cost us? and then comes the reaction of feeling,' I retorted.</p>
               <p>"'Then I should say it were better for the prize not to be secured, since "the
                  pleasure's in the chase," as the old song says,' she said, looking at the
                  manuscript, but, by the flashing of her eyes, betraying the ambiguity of her
                  meaning.</p>
               <p>"I have not been near her for three days, and I know trouble is brewing; but I
                  deserve it for letting her whims control me, and herself despise me for it."</p>
               <p>I hope the reader's patience will be as inexhaustible as the person's to whom I
                  wrote so confidentially of my scenes with Sarah; but I give the letter here for
                  the sake of introducing the life I had led with her before the opening of the
                  story. I have begun with the end of our engagement, to save the story from the
                  dull monotony of a year's cooing; but I must give some clue to an engagement and a
                  person exerting an influence through the whole story, and, before I introduce
                  other persons and other engagements, dispose of those on hand.</p>
               <p>No one, except a misanthrope or a jealous critic of her own sex, could look at
                  Sarah without feeling, whatever her faults were, she was a very superior rior
                  girl. She had lustrous black eyes, and a brow so high and noble-looking that the
                  diadem I had said it would become was not introduced for the purpose of flattering
                  her; for it had often occurred to me as a suitable ornament, as I gazed enchanted
                  on the high-born style of her beauty. Her mouth was so delicately and firmly cut,
                  a person could imagine that the keenness and force of her repartee was owing to
                  the shape and temper her sentences must have acquired in passing between her lips.
                  The greatest charm of her beauty was, however, in her unconsciousness of it, or,
                  being conscious, left to weaker minds the foolishness of being vain of anything
                  given by nature for a short season, while she made her wit, and the intelligence
                  of her conversation, her greatest attraction to her admirers.</p>
               <p>This, I must say, had been her greatest attraction to me, who held beauty in
                  distrust, unless I thought the mental and moral as well favored and developed as
                  the physical person. With others it was mostly the same, for while her beauty
                  attracted them to her side, her bright intellect bound them fast there.</p>
               <p>Knowing her power of making and retaining admirers, she often abused it, by
                  spurning and recalling them at her pleasure; so that, though I had many rivals,
                  none of them feared her less or suffered as little from her caprice as I did; and
                  now that I had resigned all claims to her favor, I could not feel that my loss was
                  some other man's gain.</p>
               <p>During the first few weeks after our quarrel, I<pb n="18-19"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000010"/> tried to disperse any regrets my lonely hours would
                  awake in me, by recalling the many outcroppings of selfishness and heartlessness I
                  had observed during our intercourse; for, while her manner of saying a heartless
                  speech softened the hardness of the sentiment at the time, I only remembered the
                  spirit of her words now, and wondered why her pretty way of saying them could ever
                  make me forget their true meaning and intent.</p>
               <p>Wit, in the mouth of a beauty especially, is the <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >ignis-fatuus</foreign> of truth; and, while we are deluded by it, we fail to
                  discover the worth of her words or herself. With it Sarah could parry a
                  heart-searching inquiry, turn aside an accusation, leave a question of ethics
                  unanswered, evade any grasp made at her opinion, and with the skill of a
                  diplomatist search out another's mind, while she veiled her own from the most
                  critical scrutiny.</p>
               <p>I may as well end it by saying that Sarah was too much for me, and I could not
                  love her as one that I could admire less and trust more.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>A MONTH had now elapsed since I burned my letters (and with them all the evidence
                  necessary for proving a breach of promise against Sarah), and I was as cheerful
                  and contented as a man need wish to be.</p>
               <p>The number of my friends in the great city in which I had struggled for years did
                  not exceed the fingers of one hand; and counting those only to whom I opened my
                  heart, the number could be reduced to two.</p>
               <p>One of those had been Sarah, of course, and the other one was the person to whom I
                  had written the letter quoted from in the last chapter; as he had been absent from
                  the city at that time. As the monotony of spending every evening over "Gibbon's
                  Roman Empire" was beginning to become wearisome, I received word from my friend,
                  informing me that he would be in the city the day I would get his note, and he
                  would be glad to see me at his rooms as soon as my engagements would let me call.
                  As I had no engagement on hand since my engagement to take Sarah to the concert,
                  there was nothing to prevent me from calling on him that same evening; and I was
                  rejoiced at the return of one who for years had contributed so<pb n="20-21"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000011"/> much to making my evenings the happiest part of my
                  days. Very soon after dusk I stood at his door, thumping with all my might over a
                  plate as long and as wide as a brick, with "Robert Heberton, Artist," engraved in
                  copper-plate style on it.</p>
               <p>I rushed past the dull-eared old negress who answered my summons, and bounded up
                  the stairs, three steps at a stride, until I heard the artist shout from the
                  top,—</p>
               <p>"Bravo, old fellow! I knew it was you by the way the <q>
                     <l>'Quivering drawbridge rocked and rung;'"</l>
                  </q> and we met with the noisy demonstrations usually indulged in, in a building
                  let out for offices; with no one besides the old janitress there after six
                  o'clock. Here he led a sort of Bohemian life, painting, sleeping, and spending
                  such evenings as he expected my visits on, and every other evening for aught I
                  knew to the contrary. As he was always cheerful, and moderately fleshy, I suppose
                  he fared better than Bohemians are believed to fare generally, and his living so
                  apparently lonely was a matter of choice rather than of necessity.</p>
               <p>Though we had known each other for years, I had no knowledge of his affairs beyond
                  that he took his meals at a first-class boarding-house close by, and carried on a
                  slight flirtation at the table with an old maid who sat near him, and he knew as
                  little of mine, except that having once asked his opinion of Sarah's picture our
                  relationship was explained, and left open to discussion ever afterwards. With the
                  pursuits and annoyances of our daily lives we were much better acquainted, and
                  conversed with each other about them until we knew by report every person and duty
                  agreeable or repugnant to each other's tastes.</p>
               <p>After a few words of greeting, and many repetitions of shaking hands, we agreed to
                  consult our comfort and taste by ascending to our usual place of retirement,—the
                  roof of the house. We had not sat on it for two months, or more, and, quickly
                  doffing our boots and putting on slippers, we crept out the trap-door to the
                  slanting roof. It was well adapted to our discussions, and I always followed him
                  out there with pleasure, and sat, or stretched out, beside him, star gazing, and
                  ventilating theories that had been ventilated a hundred times by us on similar
                  occasions. Yet they always seemed new to us, and whenever we paused in an
                  argument, the hum from the street below, and the music from a neighboring hall,
                  where a band conducted their rehearsals every evening, supplied us with fresh
                  thought, and gave a tinge of sublimity to our feelings that would be missed in a
                  different situation.</p>
               <p>During the summer nights we often lingered on that perilous position until "The
                  Bear" had made a half wheel on its faithful pivot, the "Polar star;" for up there
                  both in a measure felt above the vexations and trials which chafe the youthful
                  spirit ere it is broken to the drudgery of life. We were certain<pb n="22-23"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000012"/> tain of each other's sympathy when we complained of
                  anything that made our pursuits disagreeable to us; he in the studio and I in the
                  counting-house had our sensitive parts often touched by a rough hand, and he was
                  as quick to hate the meanness and trickery of "trade" as I was to despise the
                  consequential upstart who insulted him while pretending to patronize the fine
                  arts.</p>
               <p>In four previous "misunderstandings" with Sarah he had been made my confidant, as
                  her friends seemed to be set on our separation, and had fomented and laughed at
                  our quarrels whenever they could, and I had no one besides Robert to condole with
                  me; for though Sarah's mother had been my ally, I avoided her whenever her
                  daughter had a quarrel against me.</p>
               <p>It was, therefore, only natural that Robert should lightly regard our pique about
                  the "Culprit Fay," and have supposed, instead of leading to a decided quarrel at
                  the first excuse, that it was all smooth sailing again; so we had been scarcely
                  stretched on the roof before he said,—</p>
               <p>"Well, it is all up, I suppose, between you and Miss Sarah? I mean <emph>made
                     up,</emph> of course: it must be six weeks now since you devoted yourself to
                  that delightful employment, which in the German is properly expressed by the soft
                  and musical word <foreign xml:lang="DEU">abschreiben.</foreign>"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Bob; you may laugh at me now, for it will be your last opportunity: Sarah
                  and I have agreed to have to more scenes for the benefit of our admiring friends;
                  for, though fun and amusement to them, they were pain and unhappiness and death to
                  us. We will never again see enough of each other to be offended at each other's
                  want of appreciation, or be made miserable by the chills and fevers of love," I
                  said, with pathetic verbosity.</p>
               <p>"A final quarrel, is it?" he asked in surprise, being more impressed by my manner
                  of speaking than the meaning of my words.</p>
               <p>"No; but a final reconciliation: we can be friends, as the term goes, without
                  seeing each other, I am sure," I replied, with an effort at indifference, being
                  conscious of having made a useless display of feeling in my other speech.</p>
               <p>He plucked a nail out of a shingle, and, after having demonstrated a few
                  mathematical problems on the moon-lit roof, he said,—</p>
               <p>"Well, if it has come to that at last, I can tell you I have long expected it; and
                  if you have made yourself a laughing-stock for any of your friends, you have not
                  for me; for a man so devoted to a woman as you were to Sarah is not an object to
                  be laughed at; men have lost their heads by losing their hearts first, before
                  to-day, and will after our time."</p>
               <p>"I do not blame you, or any one, for making merry at my expense; I could do so
                  myself without much effort," I replied, trying to look as if I had a merry time
                  over it already.</p>
               <p>"Well, so you may, now that you are out of it; ever since the world began men have
                  loved and<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC6133-00000013"/> married and died, and will to
                  the end of time; and the greatest and wisest of them all have often turned out to
                  be very <emph>little</emph> and very <emph>foolish</emph> when tested in the
                  crucible of love by some girl of not more than seventeen summers' growth," he
                  added.</p>
               <p>"That ought to be a source of comfort to me; but still I cannot say it is: I feel
                  utterly disgusted with my experience, and I was never fond of making friends with
                  my foibles because they had been the guests of great men before they were
                  mine."</p>
               <p>This will illustrate our way of dealing with a subject that had often before been
                  under our treatment, and upon which we had exhausted all our practical and
                  theoretical knowledge. The theme which has exercised the pens of so many authors,
                  and been the soul of all romance and poetry from the time there was any romance,
                  could not have escaped us; and though our arguments were not confined to that
                  subject, yet they often waxed warm upon it. He, being well read in history,
                  poetry, romance, and metaphysics, was entitled to be heard for his borrowed lore,
                  and I could not be denied the credit of having experience for my Mentor. I asked
                  and was not refused, I pleased and was rewarded, I offended and was punished, I
                  rebelled and was discarded.</p>
               <p>Like the Moslem tyrant, who in a passion exchanges a lifetime's power over a slave
                  for a momentary indulgence of the bowstring, Sarah crowded into a diminutive note
                  the wrath and vengeance she might have for years eked out to me.</p>
               <p>This evening the news I had to tell Robert, and the questions I had to ask him,
                  were alike forgotten in the one great topic he started our conversation on; for we
                  talked of it to the exclusion of everything else.</p>
               <p>By criticising Sarah more freely than he had ever before done, he had aroused a
                  championship in me that I did not think myself willing to undertake, and when I
                  could no longer combat the force and truth of his strictures, I cried,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, bother! I give up; I do not care now whether she has a lump of lead or a
                  piece of charcoal where her heart ought to be; so let us go below and look at your
                  new sketches, if you have any!" for I was annoyed at the ground he took to prove
                  that Sarah, if she ever had a heart, had let it before my time, and that I was not
                  the first who had been "passing" dear to her.</p>
               <p>"Well, let us go down; I have a good many new sketches; for this is my favorite
                  season, when the woods, instead of being green all over, are (to use the language
                  of an old housekeeper up there) like a great, patched bed-quilt: the oaks turning
                  red, the maples brown, and the other trees yellow, or every shade between red and
                  yellow," he replied.</p>
               <p>Half an hour was spent in looking the sketches over, and when we had examined them
                  all, he said, as if he had been thinking of it during his descriptions,—</p>
               <p>"You will have no place to spend your evenings<pb n="26-27"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000014"/> now, and as a man will become boorish when cut off
                  altogether from female society, you had better come with me some evening and let
                  me introduce you to some of my old friends. You will like them, I know, and I
                  would have asked you down there before this, only you had not many evenings to
                  spare. It is the family of my guardian, a kindhearted man, who took me from some
                  indifferent relatives after my parents died, and made my life and youth more
                  pleasant to me. As he is an artist, it was under his fostering care I learned to
                  paint; but he has been bedridden for some years, and as I knew myself to be more
                  trouble than help in the house, I moved my lodgings up here out of their way. I
                  usually spend two evenings of each week there, and they will be glad to welcome
                  you, too; for they know you already almost as well as I do, as I tell them who my
                  acquaintances are, and everything else that would interest them in their retired
                  life."</p>
               <p>"You have not interested them with my love affairs? they have been interesting to
                  too many already," I said, alarmed lest in telling them about me he had told them
                  what I considered the most interesting thing in my life: with the egotism the
                  reader has doubtless observed in all persons who call themselves lovers.</p>
               <p>"Oh, certainly not: you will never find me guilty of a breach of confidence;
                  besides, there is a young lady in the house who, I am sure, has a different idea
                  of love from that which you found upon Mulberry Street; and would, in her love for
                  truth, and faith in the genuine article, object to hear it spoken of in that way,"
                  he said, in a sarcastic way he had with him.</p>
               <p>"You are slightly disrespectful, but, as I am not in the spirit to preach on the
                  sweetness and ecstasy of the articles of my faith, I forgive you, Bob," I humbly
                  returned.</p>
               <p>He had by this time packed away all his sketches; and, taking down a case of
                  miniatures, he said, "I will show you pictures of both father and daughter, for
                  there are no other members of the family living; so that, when you go down with
                  me, which I suppose you will, you can distinguish the one from the other."</p>
               <p>The last words were spoken with an attempt at pleasantry to efface, perhaps, the
                  sarcasm of his former speech.</p>
               <p>We looked at the maiden's first, a sweet and lovely, rather than a handsome, face;
                  and when I exchanged it for the father's, he replaced it in the case, among others
                  of the same size and style. I was soon satisfied with the father's, as it had
                  nothing remarkable in it,—a benevolent face, luxuriant gray hair, glasses through
                  which intelligent eyes looked out calmly,—and I returned it to him, and asked him
                  to let me look more attentively at the daughter's picture.</p>
               <p>He took one from the case, which in size and general appearance resembled the one
                  I had seen,<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC6133-00000015"/> but, when I took it to the
                  light, it proved to be a picture of Sarah, painted when she was more girlish than
                  I had ever seen her, but still a likeness that could not be disputed, however he
                  had happened to have it among his friends.</p>
               <p>I looked at it for some time with intense admiration, tracing every lineament and
                  every change that had been made in her by time; and then, my astonishment
                  increasing, I cried, "Why, Bob! this is Sarah's picture, and not that one I had a
                  moment ago. Where did you get it? and why have you got it, pray?"</p>
               <p>He colored, and laughed as he saw the mistake, and, viewing it at a distance with
                  the air of a connoisseur, he carelessly said,—</p>
               <p>"That is the picture of a young lady whose portrait I painted six years ago. I
                  made it clandestinely, for I think she was very handsome, do you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, to be sure I do! But are you in the habit of making duplicates whenever you
                  paint a handsome young lady's portrait? Don't you see that this is Sarah's
                  picture, though it is not so much like her now?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"No, I should not think it is so much like the picture of her that you showed me;
                  photographs are a bad invention, they cannot be bribed to flatter," he evasively
                  returned.</p>
               <p>"Oh, artists can, you admit, then?" I retorted, as I turned the picture over and
                  over, to catch every shade of light on it, and every change it admitted.</p>
               <p>It was the loveliest picture I had ever seen, and though I was conscious that
                  Sarah was no longer as young and as soft looking, yet I felt all the old feelings
                  come swelling back to my heart again. Whether the original was like it or not did
                  not matter then; the mind does not wait to reason when the eye lets a flood of
                  pleasure into it.</p>
               <p>The purest style of Italian beauty was before me; the eyes and brow, which were
                  queenly in Sarah proper, were softened in the picture by an air of pensive
                  innocence that did the artist great credit; for no one but a true-hearted genius
                  could throw so much delicacy, sensibility, and womanhood into ivory.</p>
               <p>Sarah had once shown me one somewhat like it, but ashamed of the change that time
                  had made in her, she took it away before I could well examine it. How long Robert
                  had this one, and why he had never before shown it to me, were questions I forgot
                  to ask in my great desire to dispossess him of it; and I pleaded and promised,
                  until, glad to escape from more questioning, perhaps, he yielded to my
                  importunity. The moment he consented I rushed out with it, lest he should repent;
                  but I paused to look at it by every lamp-post I passed on my way home; and such
                  was my infatuation with it, that nothing but the lateness of the hour prevented me
                  from seeking, that night, a reconciliation with the original.</p>
               <pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC6133-00000016"/>
               <p>All night long I lay thinking of the past and the future; and now and then got up
                  to turn the gas on that I might have a fresh view of the Madonna; but an hour's
                  rest towards morning restored reason, and I put the picture away.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>I FEAR some doubt will exist in the reader's mind as to who is to be the hero of
                  this story: and to prevent any misunderstanding on that important question, as
                  well as to save myself from the charge of egotism, let me, before I further
                  proceed, say that Robert Heberton fills that dignified but, to a modest mind,
                  embarrassing position. Yes, these pages are before you merely for the purpose of
                  introducing him as a candidate for your sympathy; and if I am obliged to intrude
                  myself too often upon your notice, please remember that I only come for the
                  purpose of presenting him,—the master of the ceremonies introducing the lion of
                  the evening, or the fashionable modiste preparing the bride for the bridal. As he
                  lived a great deal in himself, I cannot be expected to do more than follow the
                  circumstances which reveal him; for, though we were old acquaintances, yet there
                  is always a limit to the intimacy between men, Damon and Pythias though they may
                  be. To be sure, they know how each other stand on moral and political questions,
                  whether they are generous or penurious and mean, philanthropic or cynical, modest
                  or assuming, but their hopes, their embarrassments, their disappointments they
                     safely<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC6133-00000017"/> lock up for their own
                  cogitation after their school days are over. Then they might confide the no great
                  secret of whether they intended to be a professor, a president, or a sailor, and
                  which of all the girls in the school they would fight for; but even in the story
                  of the love of David and Jonathan we read of generous, self-sacrificing affection,
                  rather than of confidential interchange of heart-thoughts.</p>
               <p>Samson and Delilah, whose bonds were those of lust on the one side and cupidity on
                  the other, could more easily ask and give the heart-secrets; and so can two women,
                  even though they may lack the confidence in each other's love and honor which men
                  have.</p>
               <p>As is generally the case, I condemned all her sex with Sarah, and did not expect
                  to derive much pleasure from Robert's kind offices in introducing me to his
                  friend, since the honors of the house were in the keeping of an agreeable-looking
                  young lady; but I consented to go, hoping I should find him a lover there, and
                  have an opportunity of finding him unworthy of my confidence, since he had kept
                  her existence and Sarah's picture secret from me, while he knew all my love
                  affairs.</p>
               <p>As we proceeded towards the street the house was located on, I said to him,—</p>
               <p>"We will have an opportunity of comparing tastes at last, for I know by the way
                  you looked at the picture you like her, Robert."</p>
               <p>"As the picture was made by myself, I may have been admiring my own handiwork, as
                  artists do sometimes. But how do you think our tastes will agree?" he
                  returned.</p>
               <p>"Oh, the past can answer that. We have never yet seen a beauty on the street to
                  whom we both gave the palm, and we never need fear a rivalry, and kill the one who
                  would come between us, as the Indian brothers are said, in the story, to have
                  done," I replied; forgetting for the moment how well we were agreed on Sarah,
                  since he thought her picture worth having.</p>
               <p>"Our ideas of beauty may be different, and yet our appreciation of character may
                  be the same; so while a passing face may speak differently to us, a full knowledge
                  of the owner would create the same likes or dislikes with us," he insisted,
                  earnestly.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but as all this has reference to the young lady we will see this evening,
                  how can it apply, since you have a more through knowledge of her than I can have
                  for years?"</p>
               <p>"Very likely; I have known her since she was eight years old, and am still
                  learning something new; but yet it will not take you many hours to see that she is
                  modest, sensible, and gentle, and that will give you a good start with her," he
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, tell me what are her tastes, her habits, and her favorite books, so
                  that I may be able to interest her, and coax her to let her lamp shine from under
                  the wings of her diffidence."</p>
               <pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC6133-00000018"/>
               <p>"No, I will not; you must find all that out for yourself; but I will tell you
                  something that you cannot learn from observation,—a little of her history.</p>
               <p>"Her father has not been out of his house during four years, and during all that
                  time she has been his companion, his nurse, and, I may say, his protector. He is
                  rather impatient, and cannot bear to let her out of his sight, or allow any one
                  else to assist him in the slightest matter. She has thus been kept at his side the
                  four best years of her life, and deprived of all the social enjoyments and
                  privileges so dear to her age and sex, and yet without a word of complaint, or
                  anything else except expressions of the most agreeable duty on her part. They have
                  no relatives worthy of the name, and, consequently, she has seen as little of the
                  outside world as a nun immured within the walls of a convent; but you must not
                  think I say this much to ask your charity, or deprecate your criticism."</p>
               <p>We had by this time arrived in front of a block of three-story brick houses, where
                  white doors and shutters, and marble steps and window-sills, were set as uniformly
                  as new pins in a row, and he hurriedly said we had time to say no more.</p>
               <p>The door he selected was opened by a servant, with the cheerful, self-satisfied
                  smile of one who had guessed, the moment the bell rang, who was at the door, and
                  with a bob which was a cross between a bow and a courtesy, she said,—</p>
               <p>"They are in the library, Master Robert."</p>
               <p>"All right," he said, half in reply and half to me, as he passed her and led the
                  way up-stairs.</p>
               <p>He had ascended the stairs about half-way when the door was opened at the head,
                  and a graceful female figure stood in the bright light, and called out a welcome
                  to him in a pleasant voice. I was behind him ascending the stairs, and had kept
                  step so well since we entered that the presence of a stranger was not known; and
                  she stepped forward and kissed him in a glad, sisterly manner that was at once
                  distinguishable from the greeting of two lovers.</p>
               <p>As I was discovered in a moment, he turned around and presented me to her, and the
                  surprise as well as suddenness of the introduction created a momentary confusion
                  of manner that was more becoming under the circumstances than otherwise. It
                  instantly passed over, like a cloud in April, and then her hand was offered to me
                  with a cordiality of manner and expressions of welcome which were as graceful of
                  her as they were grateful to me.</p>
               <p>Doubtless I was indebted for much of it to the fact that I was witness to the
                  tender greeting Robert had received; and, with womanly quickness of apprehension,
                  she feared I would interpret its warmth as meaning something more than friendship,
                  and received his friend nearly as well, to disarm me of suspicion.</p>
               <p>Character is the most charming feature any place, if it be good, and especially in
                  a book it is the only feature we can recognize and admire; yet, all being<pb
                     n="36-37" xml:id="VAC6133-00000019"/> more or less physiognomists, we naturally
                  desire to know how the outward and inward man can compare, for we have our own
                  ideas of their consistency. Well, then, to satisfy this natural desire, I will
                  tell how Lucy Davenport looked as she stood in the light from the library, though
                  I do not expect to do it successfully, as, while all right-minded people agree in
                  that which is good, not many do in that which is beautiful.</p>
               <p>She appeared to be about twenty years old, and somewhat above the medium height of
                  a woman. Her complexion was fair and rather pale, but it deepened in color a good
                  deal when animated by conversation. Her eyes were of a clear, changing blue, very
                  bright and moist and full, and only framed in a grave, thoughtful face, would be
                  always laughing, as nearly all her gladness and mirth were expressed by them. Her
                  nose, though purely Grecian, did not seem to add any beauty to her face; but it
                  had an odd expression of coyness about it that was very coaxing; so striking, and
                  yet so concealed, that it required close scrutiny to find out where the expression
                  came from.</p>
               <p>Her mouth, chin, and throat were in harmony with the moderate fullness of the rest
                  of her face; but that which added most to her beauty by its shade, and to her
                  simple dignity by its arrangement, was her hair, which was of a pale golden color,
                  and coiled and bound around her head like a chaplet.</p>
               <p>There was so much grace, suppleness, and simplicity city in every movement, I
                  could not help forgetting her face sometimes to watch her actions, as the old
                  metaphor of man being the oak and woman the vine would often occur to me, and it
                  would be delightful to imagine myself an oak with such a vine as Lucy Davenport
                  twining around and clinging to me for support.</p>
               <p>My stability as a lover may be called in question if I betray so much enthusiasm
                  so soon after the loss of Sarah; but it must not be imagined that I made all these
                  observations and experienced these feelings while standing at the library door;
                  for she led the way into the room as soon as I had been introduced, and gave me no
                  time to fall in love with her, even if I had felt so disposed.</p>
               <p>I was presented to her father at once, but as he figures only as an old man in
                  this story, I will merely remark of his appearance that he was exceedingly like
                  Robert's picture of him.</p>
               <p>I drew my chair near him as soon as Robert had answered a few leading questions
                  about his absence and return, and prepared to be pleased with whatever
                  conversation he would favor me with, seeing that Lucy's eyes were asking more
                  questions of Robert than her lips could get opportunity of setting forth to
                  him.</p>
               <p>"We owe Robert a big apple for this agreeable surprise, it is so seldom that we
                  see any one besides each other; and you are especially welcome, because I know you
                  are not, like me, always thinking of pain or paint, but keep up with the spirit
                     and<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC6133-00000020"/> enterprise of the age; something
                  that I have fallen sadly behind in," he began.</p>
               <p>Making a brief reply, I directed my eyes to the paintings which I supposed he was
                  always thinking about; for they hung in tiers on three sides of the library walls,
                  leaving only the fourth side for the books and door.</p>
               <p>Many were landscapes and fancy sketches; but some portraits from life stood out
                  prominently, as much by the plainness of their features as anything else.</p>
               <p>There was one exception, however, for while it had all the beauty that fancy and
                  genius could adorn it with, its strong resemblance to his daughter was manifest at
                  the first glance.</p>
               <p>"What do you think of that?" he asked, as his eyes followed mine to it.</p>
               <p>"I have never seen a better picture; no one would deny Miss Davenport's right to
                  claim it as hers," I confidently replied.</p>
               <p>"I suspected you were thinking so," he said, with a hearty laugh that attracted
                  the attention of the other two.</p>
               <p>"And am I not right?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Not exactly; it was painted before she was born," he answered, looking with a
                  critical eye from it to his daughter.</p>
               <p>I supposed it was her mother's, then; but did not like to say so, fearing that I
                  would be wrong again; so I merely maintained the likeness was very remarkable.</p>
               <p>"It is a forced resemblance, and merely consists of the doing up of the hair; for
                  to please my father have I sacrificed my own taste and adopted her style," said
                  the daughter, with a modest effort to deny her likeness to the beauty.</p>
               <p>"That picture is no one's in particular; it was merely an ideal of my own that I
                  used to be in love with when I was too poor to think of a real living woman, for
                  whose comfort and existence a butcher and a baker would be necessary," he said,
                  with a genial smile, as if he had been always above the folly of looking upon
                  women as angels, and continued:</p>
               <p>"We very seldom see our ideals, much less marry them, and despairing of meeting a
                  being which existed only in my mind, I transferred my fancy to canvas, and
                  romantically resolved to devote myself to its adoration. When I met Lucy's mother,
                  I did not think the hair, complexion, and eyes of this ideal so essential to my
                  happiness, for that is her picture above it; but still my old love was allowed a
                  place in the family, for my wife was not jealous of it, though she had been told
                  its romantic history. She had a Quixotic notion of justice, and having robbed this
                  picture of her lover, she gave it her own love in return, and was so constantly
                  looking at it before our girl was born, I believe Lucy's strange resemblance was
                  due to it. Such phenomena of nature have remarkable precedents, sir: I had an
                  uncle, who was consul in Turkey, and his wife held the black<pb n="40-41"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000021"/> slaves of the town in such horror and disgust that
                  a son was born unto her with the heavy, repulsive features of the Abyssinian, only
                  perfectly fair in complexion."</p>
               <p>His tongue seemed tireless, and while my eyes never left his face, my ears were
                  with Robert and Miss Davenport, who had again relapsed into a pleasant <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-tête.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>The old gentleman probably noticed the vacancy of my expression, and addressed
                  himself to the children, as he fondly called them.</p>
               <p>"Your letters never informed us why you left the city before the expected time. I
                  thought you were sick, and wanted Lucy to run down to your room and play 'Sister
                  of Mercy,'" he said, as soon as they had faced him.</p>
               <p>The "Sister of Mercy" did not apparently think that her visits ought to be spoken
                  of before a stranger, for she turned to me and stammered in explanation,—</p>
               <p>"Whenever Robert does not come in his regular calls, my father thinks nothing but
                  sickness detains him,—just as if a young man had no medium between sickness and
                  visiting! About three years ago he failed to put in appearance his usual evening,
                  and my father becoming alarmed for him, sent me down to his room to look after
                  him, where I found the poor young man very sick indeed. I did not know whether he
                  had the blues or a fever; but I gave him half a dozen different medicines to make
                  sure of the right one, and brought him home and nursed him so well that he has
                  never since needed either a doctor or a nurse."</p>
               <p>"Then, I must say, he is very good, as well as very healthy, if he has not been
                  taken sick often since under the temptation of such tender nursing: your patience
                  and goodness would be greatly abused by many whom I know," I said.</p>
               <p>It was an unfortunate return for the effort she made to clear herself in my
                  estimation, and it appeared to create more confusion than her father's remark did
                  at first; because, being unaccustomed to society, the little compliments which are
                  given and taken with ease there seemed flattery to her, and she doubtless thought
                  I was quizzing her.</p>
               <p>Her politeness, however, helped her to overlook my apparent ill manners, and she
                  rallied, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, he knows that as far as my skill and knowledge goes medicine is medicine all
                  the same, except that I have an idea the most nauseous is the best; and also that,
                  as it was the first offense, we were more tender of him than we would be if he
                  imposed upon our benevolence too often."</p>
               <p>She paused a moment, and then thinking she had said quite enough in explanation,
                  she continued to Robert,—</p>
               <p>"I hope my father's apprehensions were unfounded, and that you were not sick the
                  week before you left the city."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no. I was unexpectedly called away in another direction, and did not get to
                  my intended destination as soon as I expected; so you would<pb n="42-43"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000022"/> not have found me at my lodgings had you called,"
                  he replied, with some difficulty, for he had been laughing all the time at my
                  stupidity, in regarding himself and Lucy Davenport in the light of lovers, and
                  also at her unsuccessful efforts to clear herself from the apparent indelicacy of
                  calling at the lodgings of a young man merely because he had failed to call on
                  her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenport was also made conscious of how much he had compromised her feelings,
                  and hastened to make what amends he could by saying,—</p>
               <p>"The girl is no longer as obedient as she was three years ago, Robert; for then
                  she did whatever I told her, without questioning its propriety; but since she was
                  eighteen she has sometimes brought her womanly notions of decorum in direct
                  conflict with my parental authority, and as she can beat me at these fine points,
                  I am always forced to yield to her. The poor child is deprived of her best parent,
                  and an old man cannot make his own ideas the criterion for her."</p>
               <p>There was a sadness in his last words that was felt by all alike, and the subject
                  was immediately changed. It, however, left a depressing feeling behind it on his
                  daughter's mind, which was not removed by the anecdotes that followed through the
                  evening. She withdrew from her conversation with Robert, and let the male members
                  of the company sustain it with each other.</p>
               <p>Robert related all his adventures in the country for their amusement, and with so
                  much system that I could see he treasured up everything he observed, and arranged
                  it in his mind for the entertainment of his isolated friends, who listened to him
                  with an interest and appreciation that would flatter a more conceited and
                  egotistical narrator.</p>
               <p>He had thus made himself almost necessary to the happiness of his friends, who
                  were entirely dependent upon him for their information of the outside world, as
                  their knowledge had been for years confined to the people who inhabited the
                  bookshelves, and they were not very modern.</p>
               <p>The old artist was the philosopher of the party, of course, as well as the
                  moralist, for he never failed to deduce a wholesome moral from each incident. When
                  told of any deed of meanness or treachery, or word or act of impiety, he would
                  stamp on the floor, and say Oh, oh! as if it seemed incomprehensible to him how
                  the world was still as bad as it used to be. With a little capital, safely
                  invested in a paying stock, he had not cause, like Robert, to complain of
                  meanness. He even referred to his domestic as a "faithful creature, who had for
                  eight years served them as if love was the motive-power." And then, like an
                  observing young man, I made an item in my mind that Lucy had a good temper and a
                  yielding, easy disposition, or the servant would not be so long there, and so
                  faithful in her service, even for love.</p>
               <p>His daughter was merely an attentive listener during the narrations, for, by
                  jesting on the temptation of getting sick, I had changed her manners<pb n="44-45"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000023"/> for the evening, and I felt punished as well as
                  humiliated in my own mind for it. Her natural frankness and innocence had received
                  a chill, and instead of hearing the smooth sentences which followed each other in
                  such harmonious intonations, as she conversed with Robert, I was compelled to
                  listen to the more familiar voice of my friend, or to the surprising volubility of
                  her father.</p>
               <p>I being a stranger to her, and she being a stranger to society, she could not help
                  feeling that I was laughing in my sleeve at her unusual freshness, as those who
                  have not mingled much with the world are apt to be too sensitive, and imagine that
                  anything which distinguishes them from the multitude is derogatory rather than
                  otherwise to their reputation.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>AS we took our leave of them, Mr. Davenport cordially invited me to call again
                  with Robert, and as often as I pleased without waiting for him.</p>
               <p>I looked towards his daughter to see whether her face seconded the invitation, but
                  she was busily engaged in getting a book for Robert, and I was ignorant of her
                  feelings as the lady of the house.</p>
               <p>It was much earlier than Robert and I usually separated, and we entered his
                  lodgings to discuss any subject that might present itself to us for the next
                  hour.</p>
               <p>Our boots were pulled off, and we went out on our lofty observatory to catch
                  sublimity from the black clouds which were chasing each other in the heavens.</p>
               <p>But before we were long there the rain in large drops began to patter on the roof,
                  and we reluctantly took refuge in the rooms below.</p>
               <p>There was a large, old-fashioned fireplace in the studio, and as it was chilly
                  enough to make a fire very cheerful company, he kindled one of hickory in it, and
                  in a few moments it pleasantly blazed up.</p>
               <p>With our feet placed against the andirons, as if we expected them to become
                  conductors of the<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC6133-00000024"/> genial heat, we waited
                  for the fire to impart its glow to our minds.</p>
               <p>Neither spoke for some time, and when a thought was interchanged it was only on
                  the comparative merits of a wood and coal fire; but as both gave the preference to
                  wood there was no room for any argument, and we again relapsed into silence. Both
                  were no doubt thinking of the people we had just left, and Robert waited for me to
                  say something about them.</p>
               <p>I thought the old gentleman, though polite and warm-hearted, was somewhat
                  egotistical, while I knew I had given offense to his daughter; so I did not like
                  to say much about either, as there was a compact between us to state our real
                  feelings on any question, without fear of giving offense to each other.</p>
               <p>My first impressions of Lucy Davenport, as the reader knows, were very favorable;
                  but when I saw she took exceptions to the very natural speech I made I became
                  defiant, and set her down for a prude, who had not grace enough to receive a
                  compliment pleasantly, though her good sense had told her it was light and
                  meaningless. Then again I thought she and Robert were betrothed, and was somewhat
                  out of humor because he had never said anything to me about it; so I was inclined
                  to resent it by utter indifference.</p>
               <p>We finally looked at each other, and laughed, saying, in echo to each other's
                  words, "Why don't you say something?"</p>
               <p>"I have nothing to say, except to repeat that I like the wood fire very much, and,
                  if you wish it, I will show you some verses in its praise," he replied.</p>
               <p>He found them in a few moments, and placed his fancies in my hand, as follows:</p>

               <p>"It is very good to think that becoming happy is only an action of the mind, a
                  mere metaphysical condition, independent of the wants of the poor body; but the
                  real estate dealers and Lotharios will never say with envy, that 'You have a fine
                  house, and splendid wife, by Jove!' if you keep them over in Spain; though I dare
                  say it cost but little to maintain them in undecaying freshness there," I
                  remarked, as I handed the lines back to him.</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>very</emph> little, and that is why I can afford to have them: a cord
                  of hickory, sawed and piled up outside the door, at six dollars, will maintain a
                  wife and establishment in any splendor or style I fancy for a month, or will take
                  me up the Rhine or down the Amazon, or to Venice, Milan, or Munich; and I do not
                  see why I ought not to go that way, rather than be fretting because I cannot go at
                  all. To be sure, I do not sit here to muse while I have an order for a picture;
                  but it is better to have hopes to lure on, even though they are never realized,
                  than have no hopes at all," he replied.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but is it not better still to have hopes which we can reasonably expect to
                  see realized?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"All hopes are part expectation, expectation and desire; and when we desire a
                  thing, we might just as well unreasonably expect it as not, as it will come just
                  as soon, if it comes at all; and why not, then, hope for all things which we
                  desire? We cannot measure the power of the Providence that gives us as much as if
                  for our good, and we do not know what things are for our good, so I say let us
                  hope for all things."</p>
               <p>"We think alike, I am sure, Robert; but you have not expressed yourself as clearly
                  as you might. You do not mean to say that I could hope to be President, and at the
                  same time live on without making any effort to attain that distinction; while, at
                  the same time, you would not advise me to waste my time and energy in seeking what
                  I could not reasonably expect to obtain. But to leave this abstruse reasoning and
                  come to the practical facts: you desire to have a wife, and a house to put her in,
                  and because you do not wish to lodge her up here, you get one like Mackay
                  describes in his Salamandrine, and build castles in the air for her. I had no idea
                  you were so much in the real estate and matrimonial line; but since you have let
                  me in part into your secret, please tell me what has tempted you to throw open the
                  gates of your paradise to me. Is it anything your fair <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >vis-à-vis</foreign> has said to you this evening?"</p>
               <p>"Well, yes, in some measure. She told me they will in a day or two have an
                  additional member in<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC6133-00000026"/> their family, and
                  from what I know of that member elect I can predict trouble."</p>
               <p>"Well, you surprise me, old fellow! Is it a son-in-law for the old gentleman or a
                  stepmother for the daughter?" I cried, with unfeigned concern; for I thought it a
                  pity that such a tender bond as existed between them should be weakened by a
                  stranger.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, not as bad for either as that; it is a daughter to Mr. Davenport and a
                  sister to Lucy, but also a plague to all easy-going people. They, and even I, will
                  be turned upside down by her; and so will you, if you like the family well enough
                  to become a regular visitor there," he said.</p>
               <p>"I do, most certainly. But what must I prepare to suffer from the new member?
                  Anything more than I suffered from the daughter this evening?" I returned, a
                  sudden interest being created by the promise of one more friend.</p>
               <p>"Everything that a young lady most pleasing and most provoking, most frank and
                  finesse, most docile and intractable can inflict upon you. She is a mass of
                  contradictions, and will coax and cut, pet and snub, and tease and throw you in
                  spite of all you can do. She is Lucy's cousin, and used to live with them six
                  years ago. She was claimed by a nearer relative, but now is coming back to them
                  free, and an heiress."</p>
               <p>"Well, I am sure gratitude to those who were her friends when she was not so
                  independent is a good trait," I said.</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is what makes her so dangerous; she has so many good qualities, as well
                  as some which are not so lovable. There is nothing negative in her; for her traits
                  are all positive, demonstrative, and aggressive. Though there was many a happy day
                  while she was at Mr. Davenport's, there was never a quiet one; and I must say she
                  generally had things her own way there, and made the water hot for every one, and
                  I got my share of it, for she was a continual torment to me."</p>
               <p>"Ah! I see, she played mischief with your heart, old fellow, and you fear she will
                  do it again. 'A burned child,' etc., saith the old proverb; and now, though you
                  dream of fine houses up in the air, you are too proud to ask an heiress when she
                  comes within your orbit. Do I judge correctly, my dear sir?"</p>
               <p>"Very nearly so, Ned. You know me well enough to read my thoughts afar off. A
                  person to love her must lay his reason aside, and blindly yoke himself with a
                  woman who can and will exercise the power of making him happy or miserable with
                  equal ease and energy," he said.</p>
               <p>"But, my dear sir, are you not meeting trouble half way, and more, too? She has
                  not yet asked you to marry her, and even you do not know whether she is at liberty
                  to do so, were she so disposed: an heiress is not often compelled to resort to
                  such extreme measures to get a husband."</p>
               <p>"She is at liberty, at least, for I have read her letters the last six years, and
                  she is too frank to<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC6133-00000027"/> keep anything like an
                  engagement a secret; but the danger that I fear is that I may be so incautious as
                  to ask <emph>her.</emph> I believe if the girl would only lay her pranks aside she
                  would make a splendid wife; but too often men of my profession seek to wed a
                  fortune only that they may be able to follow their art mistress with more ease and
                  independence: I not only wish to avoid this, but also the very appearance of it,"
                  he replied.</p>
               <p>"Well, leave all those things in the hands of the future, and if you should fall
                  in love, come to me for advice. You have given me good counsel when I was in
                  trouble, and now, that I am out of it, I will be as faithful to you; in fact, I
                  will retail your own words back to you, so that you cannot refuse them, because
                  they are yours."</p>
               <p>"I railed at love, because there is a subtle philosophy in calling high grapes
                  sour; but, as you say, let us leave all these things to the future," he said,
                  giving the fire a furious poking, as if to cover up again all the castles he had
                  that night for the first time exposed to me.</p>
               <p>I looked into it, and thought that Lucy was free for me, if I could find a heart
                  to be in love again; and she was one who would not lead it such a thorny road as
                  Sarah had done.</p>
               <p>Then the truth flashed on my mind, and I mentally cried,—</p>
               <p>"Ah, Bob, my dear fellow! I am more far-sighted than you think I am! All this talk
                  is for effect. You are too sensible to be afraid of meeting a young lady friend,
                  however great her attractions are, and you merely tell me in this roundabout way
                  that you are not engaged to Lucy, and if I like her there is no one ahead of
                  me."</p>
               <p>The young lady who was the subject of so much conversation came, and the next time
                  we went to Mr. Davenport's we had an opportunity of judging how much danger was
                  ahead of us.</p>
               <p>Going up-stairs, we found Mr. Davenport alone in the library, where he always sat
                  or reclined when not confined to his bed.</p>
               <p>After he had greeted us, and motioned me to a seat near him, he said to
                  Robert,—</p>
               <p>"Rosy Heywood is here, and is down-stairs with Lucy, looking over her music."</p>
               <p>"Oh, is she? I must run down and see what she has turned into, the little imp!" he
                  said, and was half-way down before his sentence was concluded.</p>
               <p>I was entertained with a long discourse on Bonaparte's retreat from Moscow; for it
                  had been the subject of his reading that day, and his reflections would have been
                  instructive at any other time; but the hilarious greetings below, in which "Bob
                  and his mustache," and "Rosy and her waterfall," seemed to rise above all the
                  other elements of their admiration for each other, drew my mind away, and his
                  round periods fell on the ears of a dull, inattentive listener.</p>
               <p>He did not detect the want of intelligence in my eyes this time; but continued,
                  while my heart was down-stairs, where the sounds grew fainter and<pb n="54-55"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000028"/> fainter, until they finally died away in music. As
                  he was sublimely saying "Kings trembled for their crowns and nations for their
                  existence, but God compressed the mercury a few degrees below zero and annihilated
                  the terrible army by the breath of his nostrils," Lucy entered, and, having
                  greeted me, said that Robert and her cousin were finishing a duet down-stairs, and
                  would be up in a moment.</p>
               <p>Soon afterwards there was a rustling of silks, and some half-smothered laughing on
                  the stairs, and after a pause outside to compose themselves, Robert threw open the
                  door, and a well-dressed young lady swept into the room.</p>
               <p>Maybe I would have said sailed into it, if I had been disposed to be florid; for
                  the stately curve she made in order to reach her end of the center-table was
                  certainly like that of a large river steamer coming into her wharf. She seemed
                  wholly unconscious of a stranger's presence in the room, until her majestic,
                  though graceful, sweep brought her face to face with me, as she came to a
                  right-about at the other end of the library.</p>
               <p>As she caught the startling idea that there was a gentleman with whom she was not
                  acquainted in the room with her, Lucy came to the rescue and introduced us. When
                  she had recovered from the becoming surprise she was careful to manifest, she
                  dipped quite low, and then we were acquainted.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately for me I had forgotten to seem overcome by her grand manner of
                  entering the room, and without looking deeply impressed (though I was by her
                  affectation), I felt as easy and indifferent as one who had seen women before
                  would naturally have felt. I addressed a few words to her as I would to Lucy; but
                  they were received with such a formal, dignified, and chilling air as froze the
                  kindly smile on my face, and the temperature of my feelings suddenly fell as low
                  as the mercury had been a few moments before, when Mr. Davenport used it to freeze
                  Napoleon's "Army of Invasion."</p>
               <p>The face and tone of the newcomer were strongly impregnated with the air of a
                  Western village, and the vain self-conceit of a belle showed itself in her stiff
                  manners.</p>
               <p>She was no sooner seated than she drew forth a newspaper clipping from her pocket,
                  and said,—</p>
               <p>"Lucy, you are a French scholar, and can appreciate this prime joke!"</p>
               <p>This piece of pedantry, which, after she had assumed the airs of a belle and
                  heiress, now summed up her claims on our regard by saying that she knew French,
                  sorely tried my gravity, but it stood the test.</p>
               <p>The "prime joke in French" was read aloud by request of Robert, and it consisted
                  in the word <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ans</foreign> being pronounced <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">anes</foreign> by an American, in Paris, who wished to say that
                  Nebuchadnezzar had eaten grass for seven <emph>years,</emph> but unluckily made
                  his hearers understand that he had "eaten grass for seven <emph>asses.</emph>"</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC6133-00000029"/>
               <p>As it raised a general laugh among us, Robert triumphantly exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"There! I thought I would let Miss Rosy see we all are French scholars here. She
                  must not think that learning and the appreciation of jokes are confined
                  exclusively to her own sex."</p>
               <p>This opened a battle between Rosamond and Robert at once, who pitched into each
                  other with praiseworthy zeal for their respective sexes.</p>
               <p>Both showed keen wit, and excellent skill at repartee, with an unlimited command
                  of sarcasm; and while Lucy and I followed them as their squires, occasionally
                  putting in a sly blow, Mr. Davenport laughed aloud at the unusual excitement.</p>
               <p>Peace was at length restored; and apparently satisfied that she had lost no honor
                  in the conflict, she addressed several remarks to the company at large, and took
                  the lead in the conversation, showing herself advantageously all the time, as if
                  accustomed to admiration. Though her words were addressed to no one in particular,
                  her looks were always turned to me, when any one made answer, as if to read my
                  thoughts or approval, and I would have felt flattered by her apparent desire to
                  make an impression, only I knew that ladies of her coquettish disposition tried to
                  attract more for the novelty than for any special value they set on a stranger's
                  good opinion.</p>
               <p>I had a sentiment, which was perhaps the cause of my stubborn determination not to
                  be conciliated, and that was to never let myself be carried away by admiration for
                  a stranger while there was an older acquaintance present to feel slighted by my
                  preference. I thought the guest clearly betrayed a desire to outshine her hostess;
                  but late in the evening, seeing that Lucy did not share my feelings, but rather
                  admired her, without envy or suspicion, I gradually softened, and towards the end
                  of the visit we agreed, dissented, and conversed with the greatest animation.</p>
               <p>I regarded Robert as her admirer elect, however, and whenever an opportunity
                  offered I turned to the gentle, unassuming Lucy, who courted no admiration, was
                  reticent when she could have won it, and modestly received it when thrust upon
                  her.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenport, contrary to the opinion I had formed of him, seemed content to
                  listen to others; and while he evidently enjoyed our spirited, if not noisy, talk,
                  he seldom joined us in it.</p>
               <p>I could see that he was classing our several minds, and maybe was pairing us off,
                  if he had any of his old romance left. He seemed highly amused whenever Robert and
                  Rosamond clashed, for clash they would all the time, as neither expressed an
                  opinion that was not disputed by the other, and being compelled to support every
                  assertion by argument, they amused us all while they sharpened each other's
                  wits.</p>
               <p>There was an entertaining retrospect of their youth exploits, and quarrels, and
                  adventures, which Miss Heywood recounted to us in the most graphical language and
                  manner.</p>
               <pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC6133-00000030"/>
               <p>The day she and Robert were beside a brook, breaking the calm waters into sunny
                  ripples with their birchen switches, and Robert accidentally wet her with a few
                  drops of spray, she repaid it with interest, and he retaliated, until, becoming so
                  wet and heedless of the consequences, they pulled each other into the stream, and
                  came out dripping like water-fowl. The advantage was hers, as she could change her
                  clothes when the sport was over, while Robert, being at school in the city, and
                  out to spend Saturday and Sunday, had only one suit, and was compelled to go to
                  bed until it was dried.</p>
               <p>The day they were fishing together, and she wandered up the stream and climbed up
                  into an old overhanging willow, throwing her hat on the water and screaming to see
                  whether Robert would dive for her, like the heroes of romance; but, discovering
                  the ruse, and having two suits of clothes this time, he shook her off into the
                  stream, and swam about in it with her to show his chivalry and skill.</p>
               <p>The day she sat under a cherry-tree, while he climbed it to fill her apron with
                  cherries, and getting out on a dry branch fell head-foremost himself into her lap,
                  and nearly killed both. These rude sports and romantic ramblings by the classic
                  Brandywine, when she was a strong, romping girl, between thirteen and fourteen
                  years old, kept us laughing, interested, and unconscious of the fleeting hours
                  till it was midnight; and when at length we discovered how late it was, I boldly
                  declared to her that I had never before heard of the flight of time with so much
                  surprise and regret.</p>
               <p>She had, as Robert said she would, upset the quiet order of things at Mr.
                  Davenport's; for they usually retired at ten o'clock, and several had headaches
                  next day. But I would blame my head rather than her; she was so untiring and
                  interesting in talking, and I could listen with pleasure to her the whole
                  twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>All my prejudices and thoughts of getting even with her had vanished before I left
                  the house, and her words, her frankness, and vivacity had conquered. Her mind
                  seemed healthy, vigorous, and buoyant like her body, and the latter was such that
                  she need envy none of her sisterhood in form, health, and charms.</p>
               <p>Her large, round, dark-blue eyes, which at first sight impressed me as indicating
                  a spirit that would not be controlled by reason or decorum, softened from their
                  wildness to constancy while she was relating her riding, fishing, and rambling
                  adventures, and I read in them then an undisguised, courageous soul, such as would
                  seek and suffer for truth with unflinching devotion.</p>
               <p>When she looked at Robert sometimes, there was a fullness of feeling, an intensity
                  of expression, in them that awakened in my breast even feelings of envy, and I
                  hoped it would be my fortune, some day, to meet one whose eyes could look at me
                  with such an overflowing wealth of candor and affection.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC6133-00000031"/>
               <p>As we walked home, I communicated the sense of the last sentence to Robert, and
                  found not only that he was much less impressed than I was, but also that he
                  laughed heartily at me.</p>
               <p>When I told him he ought to feel flattered by being remembered so long and so
                  well, and, above all, by the glances of whole-souled interest she regarded him
                  with all the time, he exclaimed, with irreverent skepticism,—</p>
               <p>"Bah! that was all put on for the occasion; just for effect and nothing else. I
                  know her natural tone well, and could see, though she looked at me, she was only
                  speaking to you through me, as she saw that her first effort had not
                  succeeded.</p>
               <p>"Though it is not agreeable to be made a cat's-paw for any one, yet I could feel
                  flattered for you, my friend; but I suspect she would just as willingly use you
                  for a mouth-piece to-morrow to call some one else's attention to herself.</p>
               <p>"As for her memory, I wish it had not been so good, for she doubtless remembers
                  much more than she has told, and will call me to account for it yet, or visit her
                  resentment on me in some way, for she never forgets or forgives. Ten years from
                  now she can recall every word and look exchanged in there to-night, and though she
                  is a generous, whole-souled girl, she has her own ideas about being even with
                  every one in some way."</p>
               <p>We parted for the night; but until near daybreak my brain, half intoxicated by the
                  excitement of the evening, could not compose itself to rest. She had, by her
                  witty, independent, and sometimes extravagant language, as well as by her natural
                  lively gestures, raised my fancy to such an elevation that it required hours to
                  get it back to the level of repose.</p>
               <p>After I arose in the morning and took a good sponge-bath, my head began to get
                  cool again and my ideas to clear; and then I derived more pleasure from thinking
                  of the few words Lucy had said to me than from all the glowing speeches and
                  animated pictures with which Miss Heywood charmed me.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>As Rosamond Heywood had become one of the family at Mr. Davenport's, and had
                  promised at our first meeting to become a very interesting acquaintance, I made
                  some inquiries respecting her previous history the next evening I spent at
                  Robert's studio.</p>
               <p>She was deprived of her last surviving parent, he told me, by the death of her
                  mother, who was sister to Mrs. Davenport, and had died when Rosamond was ten years
                  old. The orphan was then taken into Mrs. Davenport's family, and while she shared
                  their city home, they all repaired during the hot summer months to the large farm,
                  which she had inherited from her mother, by the Brandywine. By some technical
                  obscurity in the wording of an old will, the farm really belonged to Mrs.
                  Davenport; but neither the artist nor his wife ever thought of taking advantage of
                  these obscurities, which are at once the reproach of our intellects, and the
                  delight of our lawyers and romancers.</p>
               <p>No sooner had Mrs. Davenport died than a brother, with less generous feeling,
                  challenged the right of Rosamond to the farm; and though Mr. Davenport at great
                  expense defended her claim, the selfish uncle succeeded in dispossessing her of
                  it, as it was decided by the court that it belonged in rotation to each sister and
                  brother, and to the heirs of the last of the occupants.</p>
               <p>This uncle had a brother in a distant State, who had no children; and ashamed of
                  his brother's churlishness, he came to claim Rosamond for adoption, and indemnify
                  Mr. Davenport for his losses in the contest.</p>
               <p>The latter offer was refused, but Rosamond was given up; and now both her uncles
                  having died, and he who had adopted her being the last owner of the farm, she
                  legally inherited it this time, as well as some wealth which her uncle had divided
                  between her and his childless widow.</p>
               <p>The widow returned to her own relatives in Tennessee, and Rosamond gratefully came
                  back to the guardianship she had enjoyed when she was less an object of
                  speculation.</p>
               <p>Six years' absence, which, as they had discovered at meeting, had brought Robert a
                  "mustache" and Rosamond a "waterfall," had also developed other qualities in her,
                  which now promised to become a pleasing contrast with Lucy's unobtrusive beauty of
                  person and mind, without making either less interesting.</p>
               <p>This account of her interested me a good deal in Miss Heywood, and, as I did not
                  feel sufficiently well acquainted with the family to visit there on my own
                  responsibility, I waited impatiently for Robert's second semi-weekly visit, not
                  wishing to go with him every time he went there. Maybe my word<pb n="64-65"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000033"/> will be doubted when I affirm that her frank,
                  unstudied way of speaking, and her good sense in returning to the artist's quiet
                  home, heiress though she had become, recommended her far more to my esteem than
                  the mere fact (which I may have already laid too much stress on) of her being an
                  heiress, and being a handsome one into the bargain.</p>
               <p>The next time I called, Rosamond was apparently up-stairs dressing, instead of
                  down at the music, and, good friends though we had parted last, all my
                  anticipations of a pleasant greeting were disappointed the moment she entered the
                  room.</p>
               <p>Even Robert was not cordially greeted, I thought, as she came into the room with a
                  dignified air; and she seemed so wholly unconscious of having seen me before, that
                  Lucy was deceived, and introduced me again, supposing that she had really
                  forgotten me.</p>
               <p>The low bow, the same majestic curve in taking a seat, the introduction of her
                  hand into her pocket, and, not finding anything there, into her work-basket, for
                  something to start the conversation on, were all repeated; and though she
                  gradually became lively and sociable with me, she did not, during the entire
                  evening, by a word or look, indicate any knowledge of a previous introduction or
                  conversation. As my admiration of Lucy received a fresh stimulus from her friendly
                  manner of receiving me every time I went there, so my detestation of Rosamond's
                  unnatural stiffness increased by a repetition of it every time we met. The girls
                  were so unlike each other it would seem almost impossible for them to become
                  rivals, and yet each one alternately reigned uppermost in my thoughts. After being
                  an hour or more in her company, my dislike for Rosamond would melt away before the
                  animated and sunny expression of her face as she warmed in conversation; and while
                  I had met her several evenings before she laid aside the coldness and stateliness
                  of her receptions, she made amends for them always ere we parted, and her voice
                  thrilled my dreaming ears long after the music of the evening had been hushed.</p>
               <p>But then again, after my dreams were over, there was no pleasure left to
                  contemplate, for the unnatural stiffness of her manner was remembered against her
                  with increasing dislike, and I was ever arguing from it to her prejudice.</p>
               <p>I have, however, strayed far ahead of time in this digression, for it was only at
                  the fourth visit I had made to the house that something happened which calls an
                  old acquaintance back to the stage.</p>
               <p>It was customary for the girls to go down to the parlor and sing after tea,
                  leaving the doors open, so that Mr. Davenport could hear the music in the library,
                  where tea was always served.</p>
               <p>One night we arrived before this evening anthem was over, and turned into the
                  parlor to enjoy Rosamond's rich, cultivated voice (for she was the singer); but
                  besides the two we expected to find, there also stood Sarah Carroll, singing with
                  them.</p>
               <p>While Robert, who I thought was a total stranger<pb n="66-67"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000034"/> to her, greeted her as an old friend, I turned to
                  the other two ladies, hoping thereby to gain time to collect my wits, which were
                  not a little scattered by the sudden and unwished-for collision. The time was
                  sufficient for the task, and when I was presented by Lucy I was as calm as
                  herself; thus we met again to begin a new acquaintance, without a prejudice being
                  suspected by or a sign of having met before visible to the others.</p>
               <p>Robert, who had so often listened to my praises of her without ever betraying an
                  acquaintance, turned to her again and expressed his pleasure at seeing her, and
                  she replied to him that she had only that day heard of Rosy's arrival from the
                  West, and could not delay calling on her.</p>
               <p>Of course this required an expression of thankfulness from Rosamond, and while
                  they were, probably for the fourth time, exchanging expressions of mutual good
                  will, Robert and I exchanged looks of pathetic dismay over their shoulders.</p>
               <p>It could easily be seen that Rosamond was not over-sincere in her professions of
                  regard, for she turned to us in a moment, and left Lucy to listen to what more
                  Sarah would say; though Lucy could not feel flattered by the speech that called up
                  these "twice-told tales" of affection.</p>
               <p>Robert, with Lucy in every thought and word, as much as he combated Rosamond's
                  sayings and doings, asked Sarah if it were possible that she did suspect Lucy and
                  himself would be glad to hear that she cared something for them too.</p>
               <p>It was asked in a merry tone of feigned reproach, which enabled Sarah to make
                  reply to the question in a laughing way.</p>
               <p>"Truth compels me to say that I did not know whether <emph>you</emph> were dead or
                  alive, though whenever I thought of you I sincerely hoped you were."</p>
               <p>"Either dead or alive? Well, I should think you might feel certain I was, as the
                  intermediate state has not been discovered yet; and as I was never good enough to
                  be translated, I must live and die like any other sinner, my fair cousin," he
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"I see you are as quick as ever, and I pity Lucy for having near her one so ready
                  to contort and retort as you are," Sarah said.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Lucy bears it very well, I thank you; in fact, she has so much patience with
                  me I should not have been surprised if you had said you expected to learn that she
                  had been translated."</p>
               <p>"No; I took pains to inquire how Lucy was, and knew that she was well; and I know
                  her still to be too generous to think I meant to slight her because I gave her
                  guest the first place in the explanation your bantering has called from me."</p>
               <p>"That clearly proves you have not forgotten me, Sarah; and I think you left me for
                  the last only to give me the best part of the pie. Robert was too impatient, and
                  pulled out a plum that has set his teeth on edge," Lucy replied, with a smile of
                  satisfaction.</p>
               <p>"I wish Luce would exchange some of her generosity<pb n="68-69"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000035"/> erosity for some of my selfishness, as we both
                  would then be better adapted to the planet we inhabit," said Rosamond, joining
                  them.</p>
               <p>"Spare me from further flattery, or I shall think you have conspired to mock me,"
                  cried Lucy.</p>
               <p>"Well, I merely wanted to say that I can never forget my own interest, or good, or
                  dues so far as to give precedence to those of the public, or to take pleasure in
                  anything that benefits others but leaves me in the cold," returned Rosamond.</p>
               <p>"Bear that in mind, Ned, and whenever you give compliments to the sex in general,
                  remember Rosamond must have one for her individual use, or else it does not reach
                  her at all," said Robert to me, who had been silent all this time.</p>
               <p>"As for you, you provoking cynic, I know how left-handed your compliments are, and
                  fear more than I covet them; and I hope Mr. Pearson will be guided by his own
                  strong sense of what is due to us, each and all, rather than by your advice. If,
                  however, I may be permitted to offer a suggestion where I am principally
                  concerned," she added, with amusing coquettishness, "allow me to say, that three
                  compliments for me, two for Miss Carroll, and one for Lucy is about the proportion
                  our vanity requires."</p>
               <p>I promised to remember her advice, but hoped that, as I was very sincere in my
                  speeches, my compliments would not be received as the flattery of a courtier.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, sir! if you are so <emph>very sincere,</emph> we shall hear from you so
                  seldom you may be sure the rarity of your compliments, if nothing else, will
                  insure them our regard."</p>
               <p>"Then, if they should be rare, attribute it to the fact that our deepest feelings
                  are seldom expressed; partly for the want of suitable words to convey them, and
                  partly because we fear they will not be heard with the veneration which, in our
                  own estimation, they deserve," I replied to her.</p>
               <p>"That certainly is a handsome speech to begin with; and I doubt not that you will
                  be able to invent some means by which those ineffable sentiments can be conducted
                  to our ears, if we only give you the encouragement you deserve," she replied,
                  asking Sarah, at the same time, "if she had ever seen such a ready man?"</p>
               <p>Of course Sarah replied that she had not, and at that moment our eyes as they met
                  could not conceal a look of intelligence which nearly betrayed us.</p>
               <p>I felt some confusion at being found in such fair society, and in such good
                  spirits, so soon after the time when my compliments were for her alone.</p>
               <p>Only about two months had passed by, and now I was "a ready man" again, to
                  compliment a stranger as I had her before.</p>
               <p>These feelings were deepened by the sedate, if not pensive, expression which had
                  taken the place of the gayety and buoyancy of her recent manners; and, though I
                  had been released from our engagement by<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC6133-00000036"/>
                  her own wish and action, yet I felt now somewhat chagrined at the thought that my
                  character for stability was compromised by the position she had found me in. There
                  was a sudden but earnest desire to assert my right to her respect, if not to
                  deserve her friendship, though I had no wish to recall anything that was now among
                  the past.</p>
               <p>She had wasted the best years of her life in flirting, trifling, and quarreling,
                  and when a woman, who is thoughtful and intelligent enough to know that youth and
                  beauty are tolerated in power scarcely longer than a presidential term, sees her
                  jealous, fickle, and exacting subjects waiting to depose her, the consciousness
                  that her freshness is fast fading, and her power approaching its end, must prey
                  like a vulture upon the vitals of her peace and hasten the decay she fears.</p>
               <p>Though one of those years had been wasted upon me, and I was a party to many a
                  foolish quarrel, yet I could not accuse myself with being an accessory to the
                  flirting and trifling which led to them, or that I was equally guilty of playing
                  with that dangerous bird of prey,—time.</p>
               <p>I could forgive her, because she had violated her own good sense as much as she
                  had my feelings; and I pitied her, because by her sex the loss of time was the
                  more deplorable to her.</p>
               <p>These were the self-complacent thoughts which passed through my mind while Robert
                  and Rosamond were enjoying their customary tilt with each other, and I was left to
                  my own reflections; for Lucy had excused herself, and taken Sarah upstairs with
                  her, immediately after our general conversation.</p>
               <p>I was greatly surprised and annoyed at Robert's manifest duplicity. He had called
                  Sarah cousin, and had yet heard from me all our affairs; and for the confidence I
                  had reposed in him, had not only kept me in ignorance of his acquaintance with
                  her, but had also often said things calculated to turn my mind against her.</p>
               <p>I was framing a severe speech by which to make my displeasure fully known to him
                  as soon as we left the house, when Lucy returned and said that her father wished
                  to see us all up in the library at once, in order to count how many friends he now
                  had.</p>
               <p>As Robert and Rosamond preceded us up-stairs, I said to Lucy,—</p>
               <p>"If you keep on multiplying your friends you will have a house full in a week or
                  two, and, lest we should interfere with your privacy too much, you will be
                  compelled to appoint a reception-day each week for them."</p>
               <p>"Oh, there is no danger to fear from that, for you are really the only addition we
                  have, as Miss Carroll is my cousin, and, like Rosy, is an old friend come back to
                  us," she replied.</p>
               <p>"Is she Miss Heywood's cousin, too?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, we three are first cousins; all Carrolls in fact, descended, and maybe I
                  should say degenerated, from the Revolutionary Carroll. Cousin<pb n="72-73"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000037"/> Sarah is more sedate than Rosy, but I am sure you
                  will like her none the less for that; in fact, I believe you admire dignified
                  people, do you not?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, when the dignity is natural; and, if I may say so without egotism, I am
                  philosopher enough to like whatever is natural in the human character, as well as
                  in any other part of nature. It is in the pleasing variety of character society
                  has its charms, and it would kill society in a short time if all the people which
                  compose it were dignified, or, at least, if they had that reserve and self-esteem
                  which pass for dignity. But the most killing thing of all would be to see each
                  person, thinking the character and manners of some other person more becoming, lay
                  aside a habit which was natural and easy to himself and assume a borrowed
                  one."</p>
               <p>My philosophy, such as it was, set her thinking, and she said in a half-audible
                  reverie,—</p>
               <p>"What a serious blunder I made when I told Rosy you liked dignified people!"</p>
               <p>"Eh! Did you tell Miss Heywood that? And mistake me so much?" I asked, catching
                  her words up quickly.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I thought so," she said, starting and blushing, and then added, with a
                  candor and confidence which proved she was already forming a more favorable
                  opinion of me,—</p>
               <p>"I thought you were very severe and critical, and feared you might judge her
                  harshly at first. Robert does not mind her pungent pleasantries, because he has
                  known her so long; but she could not hope to be understood as well by a
                  stranger."</p>
               <p>Poor Rosamond! her curves, and dips, and stately airs all put on for me! I felt
                  amused and flattered as we entered the room, and was glad to know that her natural
                  spirit and vivacity would not be restrained longer than an hour at a time, in
                  spite of all she could do to make herself dignified.</p>
               <p>After a few general remarks, the conversation assumed the character of <foreign
                     xml:lang="FRA">tête-à-têtes.</foreign> I kept near Lucy, Sarah sat down by Mr.
                  Davenport, while Rosamond and Robert, who seemed to enjoy a continual tilting of
                  wits, engaged each other in a corner.</p>
               <p>Lucy, being innocent-minded, was very easily "pumped;" and since Robert was so
                  thoroughly conversant with my love affairs, and the family acquainted with Sarah,
                  as well as having heard of me through Robert, I felt anxious to learn whether he
                  had not mentioned our relations to them before the engagement had been broken
                  off.</p>
               <p>"Miss Carroll's dignity is as natural to her as Miss Heywood's sprightliness is to
                  her also, and between them you will enjoy a pleasant temperature of social
                  atmosphere," I said, with a view to the aforesaid "pumping" process.</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, my father used to admire Miss Carroll very much, and so used Robert; and
                  though we have not seen her for many years before today, I presume she is as much,
                  if not more, admired than ever in the circle of her acquaintance. We did not hear
                  a word of her since we saw her last;<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC6133-00000038"/> but
                  she has completely won father's esteem and affection by coming here to
                  congratulate Rosy upon her accession to fortune, under circumstances which are
                  very delicate and peculiar."</p>
               <p>Her innocent, silvery voice kept on, winning its way to my heart by its sweetness,
                  above all by the implicit confidence I had in the truthfulness of every word she
                  spoke. I was soon satisfied that if Robert had kept me in the dark he had also
                  kept his own counsel, when the temptation to tell them of Sarah's engagement with
                  me was great. He was forgiven on the spot for his discreetness, and in fact I
                  admired him all the more for being able to listen so often to my praises of
                  Sarah's beauty and accomplishments, without betraying by a look his amusement at
                  hearing me describe her to him; and also for his tact in accounting for the
                  picture I found in his possession without telling me a falsehood. The last hour
                  had added much to my already great respect for his qualities, and he was fast
                  becoming a hero in my estimation.</p>
               <p>I was aroused from my reflections by a remark Lucy made which was so far-fetched
                  that I knew she had become embarrassed by my silence; for, being diffident, she
                  lost confidence in herself the moment her conversation had ceased to elicit
                  remarks.</p>
               <p>"You have also a good opportunity to improve the time in Miss Carroll's way; for
                  you have a very considerable and well-selected library here," I observed, in reply
                  to what she had said.</p>
               <p>"I am glad you and Robert think so, for Rosy has made me ashamed of them; she says
                  they are a very dry and dull collection, with the exception of a few historical
                  novels. One of them I read to father lately, and it has left a sentiment on my
                  mind ever since; and, though the words were uttered by a wild, lawless character,
                  they have been ringing in my ears all the time. Otherwise I did not like the book
                  much; yet I would rather read a book barren of incident, but with one noble
                  sentiment to attract the attention, than a mere tale of love and adventure which
                  left nothing except a dull, mental lassitude behind it."</p>
               <p>"What sentiment was it, pray, that you admired so much?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"'Many a law, many a commandment, have I broken, but my word never!' It is
                  encouraging to know, that however a man may be steeped in crime, he can have one
                  sentiment of honor, one principle, that has never been violated, and which, being
                  appealed to, could make him a man again. Especially is there something to hope for
                  and trust in a man when his word is his honor; I could forget everything else
                  against hope when I knew his word, being once pledged, was sacred to him, and
                  could be relied upon."</p>
               <p>"Ah, it was the Knight Templar you met with! Was not Miss Rosamond equally
                  impressed with the tale?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, she liked it; I was only interested in the fate of Rebecca, and her poor,
                  persecuted old father; but Rosy liked Ivanhoe and Robin Hood most."</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC6133-00000039"/>
               <p>"What about Rosy and her contemporary, Robin Hood, my dear?" asked Rosamond, who
                  had caught her own mellifluent name, mingled with the celebrated archer's, above
                  the rest of the conversation, and immediately broke off her own sentence to make
                  the inquiry.</p>
               <p>"We were speaking of your literary taste," I said, replying for Lucy.</p>
               <p>"Well, I must confess it is very contracted; for I cannot endure any of the graver
                  classes except history," she answered.</p>
               <p>"What histories have you been reading lately?" asked Robert, archly.</p>
               <p>"Indeed I cannot remember; for I do not even care for history unless it comes in
                  the shape of the 'Days of Bruce,' 'Tales of the Crusaders,' Scott's novels, or in
                  some way flavored and colored with the cream of romance."</p>
               <p>A general laugh followed this candid acknowledgment; and, piqued that her
                  frankness and taste had been made a subject for laughter, she fired up against
                  Robert, and hurled in his face invectives at his disposition to ridicule.</p>
               <p>I was surprised at seeing her so openly betray the quick, passionate temper her
                  physiognomy indicated; but no one else appeared so, or seemed even annoyed by the
                  sudden ebullition, and she continued until it had spent itself.</p>
               <p>As her eyes emitted the last sparks of anger, Robert soothingly said,—</p>
               <p>"There, now, be calm and forgive me, like a good girl, and I will confess my
                  fault, and admit that I was tempted to tease you, because you look so spirited and
                  dangerously interesting when you get angry; in fact, something like that Flora
                  MacIvor we are introduced to by Scott, your favorite <emph>historian.</emph>"</p>
               <p>The rapidity with which this speech acted, like oil upon the troubled waters,
                  showed the susceptibility of her mind to flattery, and the electric flashes of
                  satisfaction it called up betrayed vanity to be the most assailable point in her
                  character. She confessed how fond she was of romance, and how tame she found the
                  real incidents of everyday life, and all the while her eyes expressed more
                  appreciation of Robert's motive, in calling forth her warm temper, than
                  mortification in having so publicly exposed it.</p>
               <p>The conversation had scarcely been resumed by twos again before we heard the
                  door-bell ring, and Sarah arose, saying that it was a servant whom she had
                  directed to call for her at that hour, and she would now wish us a
                  good-evening.</p>
               <p>Her manner of taking leave was suited to each one of the company, with her usual
                  discrimination; and she so acquitted herself that we all felt a perfect mistress
                  of deportment and good breeding had left us, however much our private opinions
                  differed in regard to her real character.</p>
               <p>The opinions were not expressed then, of course, but I think they stood
                  thus,—Robert and Rosamond believed the worst; Mr. Davenport and Lucy<pb n="78-79"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000040"/> believed the best; while I held medium views,
                  hoping she would judge me as charitably from her standpoint as I tried to judge
                  her from mine.</p>
               <p>We both wore masks in the family, but our previous history did not concern the
                  good people at Mr. Davenport's; and we could not do otherwise than we had done;
                  and, though deception had been practiced, I do not think they would have condemned
                  us for it had they known it, more than we would have condemned others placed in
                  the same situation as ourselves.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>I HAVE now introduced those with whom we will have most to do in this story; but I
                  find I have inconvenienced myself somewhat by adopting this autobiographical
                  method of writing about them. Most authors have the advantage of ubiquity, by
                  being impersonal in their tale; but I have unwittingly forfeited that by making
                  myself as any other character in it.</p>
               <p>It is no trifling advantage, truly, when with it an author can follow each person
                  in a separate path, become acquainted with the thoughts and motives of each,
                  without waiting for time to reveal them, and report conversations which would not
                  have taken place had the presence of a third party been suspected. All this my
                  oversight has lost to me, rightfully; but as I did not undertake to write an
                  autobiography, I will not wait to explain how I came to know it whenever I tell
                  anything that was said or done when I was not present.</p>
               <p>But Robert can be quoted as my authority at present, because I learned from him,
                  on our way home from Mr. Davenport's, more about Sarah's relationship to the
                  family than Lucy had told me.</p>
               <p>She was cousin to Rosamond and Lucy, and the<pb n="80-81"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000041"/> daughter of the man who had taken Rosamond's farm
                  from her by the force of the law.</p>
               <p>Though more aristocratic in feeling than the artist's family, on account of
                  greater wealth, she was almost a daily visitor there, until the time Lucy's mother
                  died; and Robert, living then in the family, was as intimately acquainted with her
                  as if she had been his own cousin.</p>
               <p>She was four years older than either of her cousins, and patronized them in
                  consequence, while they allied for mutual sympathy and defense against her
                  pretensions. To be old enough to set up for a young lady was the greatest extent
                  of ambition and happiness their youthful minds could encompass; and with no little
                  envy they saw the precedence Sarah's age gave her to the attentions of Robert,
                  their joint squire.</p>
               <p>Robert, too, was not insensible to the attractions of her maturity, and willingly
                  paid her the attentions she was so rigid in exacting, both in the most approved
                  forms of etiquette, and on the most trifling occasions for gallantry.</p>
               <p>Rosamond was sensitive of these claims to an excessive degree, for her natural
                  precocity rebelled against a slight, and almost while a child she imbibed a
                  jealousy of Sarah which lasted for life.</p>
               <p>When the lawsuit for the farm at last put an end to the peaceful flow of family
                  intercourse, the girls' intimacy was discontinued, and had never been renewed
                  until this time, three years after the author of the discord had mingled with the
                  dust of his coveted earth.</p>
               <p>Sarah had made the only amends she could by calling on Rosamond, if indeed a child
                  can be said to be amenable for the actions of its father, in a country where
                  attainting is forbidden by its constitution.</p>
               <p>After the company had withdrawn that night, and with Sarah's parting kiss yet warm
                  on her cheek, Rosamond showed her appreciation of the visit, by saying,
                  exultingly, to Lucy,—</p>
               <p>"Eh, Luce, my dear, now has <emph>our</emph> time come to be the young ladies!
                  What a difference four years do make, after all! I could not realize it when we
                  were only fourteen and she was eighteen; but circumstances alter cases now, when
                  she is twenty-four and we are but twenty! Ugh! It makes the blood cold in my veins
                  to think of being twenty-four years and not yet married! How the thought that she
                  can no longer overshadow us and monopolize the beaux must prey upon her beauty!
                  What is it somebody tells us about an old maid? 'She never told her love, but let
                  concealment, like a worm, prey upon the damask roses of her cheeks!' Something
                  like that. <emph>Twenty four years, and we are only twenty!</emph> Hurrah for the
                  young ladies, now! Hurrah, Luce, I say!"</p>
               <p>"Rosy dear, do not be so severe on Sarah, she is not so old yet, and I am sure
                  four years do not make so much difference at our ages now as when we were so much
                  younger," replied Lucy, entreatingly<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC6133-00000042"/>
                  ingly, lest her father should overhear the uncousinly exultation.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Twenty-four years, and we are only twenty!</emph> Who will command the
                  attentions of the beaux now? Lucy, <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ma chère,</foreign> we
                  played our parts well without a rehearsal! You kept Mr. Pearson from saying two
                  words to her all the evening, and I labored quite as hard, and almost as
                  successfully, to keep Bob from wasting any of his old smiles on her.
                     <emph>Twenty-four</emph>—"</p>
               <p>"Cousin Rosy, you are going mad, I fear! I did not labor to keep Mr. Pearson or
                  any one else from speaking to her, and I am surprised that you should be so
                  ungenerous to—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Twenty-four years, and we are only twenty</emph>—"</p>
               <p>"To one who has called on you the moment she heard of your arrival in town, though
                  your gain was her loss. My father and Robert both think it is very handsome of her
                  to do so," persisted Lucy.</p>
               <p>"Your father entertained her with his history and philosophy all the evening, and
                  he can do so again if she comes, while the other two attend to our wants. His
                  solid conversation is well suited to her advanced age. <emph>Twenty-four
                     years!</emph> Who would have thought six years ago that even the revolutions of
                  the earth would so change the order of things that we would be ever counted
                  anything except children! Oh, oh, my blissful soul! how it makes me laugh to think
                  how majestically she used to wave her fan, like a scepter, and say '<emph>the
                     children,</emph>' whenever we wanted Robert to do anything for us! I guess he
                  will not mind her scepter now! <emph>Twenty-four years old, unmarried, and without
                     a beau!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The wayward girl had exhausted her breath for a moment, and Lucy replied,—</p>
               <p>"As much as he ever did, and more, too, if he thought she was so desolate and
                  hopeless as you describe her. How could he say much to her to-night, when father
                  monopolized her altogether?"</p>
               <p>"Would he, indeed? Well, then, hear how he now treats the 'Queen of Love and
                  Beauty' of his extreme youth," she gleefully exclaimed, thrusting her hand into
                  her pocket, which was the receptacle of all the curiosities of floating literature
                  that came in her way before she transferred them to her scrapbook. "I cut these
                  lines out of a magazine, for I saw they were signed with my initials. Of course I

                  inspired friend Robert, how 'coming events cast their shadows before,' to thee!"
                  she exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"I say it has no reference to Cousin Sarah."</p>
               <pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC6133-00000044"/>
               <p>"Yes it has! 'May Merle is silently sitting,' listening to your father, of course,
                  'Midst maidens and gallants so gay,'—which means us,—you and I, Mr. Pearson and
                  Robert: could anything be more explicit? The first time I saw him after I came
                  home to you, I asked him about Sarah, and twitted him because he did not get her
                  after all his attentions. He told me he had heard of her lately, and she was not
                  married yet, so that it was not too late to renew their old acquaintance; but
                     <emph>it is;</emph> and he knew it. 'Could she youth and her heart now
                  recover;' but she cannot—and the muse broke down here at the impossibility of such
                  a thing; for a woman has no heart or youth left her at twenty-four; the
                     <emph>girl</emph> has squandered both away if she had enough of charms to make
                  her prodigal, which Sarah had, my dear" And here she was compelled to pause for
                  breath.</p>
               <p>Lucy was looking at the lines, when her opportunity of saying something came
                  again, and she mildly retorted,—</p>
               <p>"Rosy, I am glad no one besides a cousin and a friend hears you speak thus; if any
                  one else had heard you treat a relative and a woman that way, what would be
                  thought of yourself or your sex?"</p>
               <p>"Why, that I spoke my mind without fear or favor; and I would not care if they
                  thought otherwise; for who <emph>is</emph> any one else, that I should mind them?
                  I hate my sex, and am ashamed of it, for fearing to do and speak the truth
                  independently of what any one else may think of it. What do we learn to repeat the
                  Declaration of Independence at school for if we do not practice it, pray?"</p>
               <p>"We learn from it that it was the fruits of a '<emph>decent respect to the
                     opinions of mankind;</emph>' and a person's self-respect, or independence, is
                  never compromised by a modest desire to have the approval of all whose opinions we
                  ought to respect," said Lucy, gravely; for being trained by her father, her mind
                  easily turned upon argument, and what passed as current wisdom or leading moral
                  truths among less careful and subtle minds, was well filtered and analyzed before
                  it was indorsed by her.</p>
               <p>"Well, Lucy, we will not quarrel about her! We have always stood by each other
                  against her, and we may be compelled to do it again."</p>
               <p>"Those times are past, and the causes of our jealousies were as childish as
                  ourselves; so there is no need to anticipate fresh vexations; for I trust we have
                  grown wiser with our years."</p>
               <p>"Maybe we have, but the wisdom that comes with age does not always make us better;
                  all women are our rivals and enemies to compete with, and one that has reached the
                  age of twenty-four is not to be despised, for she generally makes up in experience
                  and duplicity as much power as she has lost in freshness and youth."</p>
               <p>Lucy gazed a moment upon the speaker, as if unable to comprehend the spirit of her
                  philosophy, and then said, with her voice softened almost to a sigh,—</p>
               <p>"I wish you had never left us, Rosy, for I am<pb n="88-89"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000045"/> sure that such feelings would not have been
                  engendered here with us. It must make you very unhappy to look upon your own sex
                  as your rivals and enemies, when Providence has made us weak that we might
                  befriend and sympathize with each other."</p>
               <p>"With all respect for your own goodness and opinion, Lucy dear, I do not think
                  that Providence ever had such intentions concerning us. We are made different from
                  all other creatures of the earth, in that the female of man is expected to have
                  all the beauty and accomplishments with which to charm a mate to itself. Look at
                  Audubon's Ornithology, for instance, and you will see that the male bird is always
                  the most beautiful; has the gayest plumage and the sweetest voice, and then with
                  these, the attendant duties of strutting, cackling, cooing, singing, parading, and
                  fighting to attract and please the female saddled upon it; while the female is
                  plain, passive, silent, and sedate, but entirely free from the vanity, rivalry,
                  jealousy, contentions, and cares which appear to be inseparable from the beauty
                  and gifts of the male bird. They are not trained or schooled to act such different
                  parts, or restrained by parents, propriety, or philosophy, so you must admit their
                  customs and feelings are as Providence ordained them. Now, with mankind it is
                  reversed: the female has the gifts and beauties of the male of the feathered
                  tribe, and how can the feelings and duties be different with the same object in
                  view when she got them?</p>
               <p>"These feelings and duties compel us to sing, parade our forms, and adorn them
                  with plumage; show off our accomplishments and beauties, fight and intrigue, to be
                  mated; and how can we be otherwise than jealous and envious to the end of our
                  days? For my part, I would rather see my sex like the hen birds, with no beauty to
                  make us jealous, and no duties, save that of quietly choosing, to make us enemies;
                  but, since it is not so, nothing remains for me to do but to accept the
                  disagreeable and distracting situation, and make the best fight I can for myself!"
                  she exclaimed.</p>
               <p>This was a standpoint from which Lucy had never been taught to view nature by her
                  father; and, seeing how far astray Rosamond was, without knowing how to convince
                  her of error, she merely put the theory in a practical light by saying,—</p>
               <p>"So Providence intends, then, that you and I should envy, annoy, and hate each
                  other in spite of the ties of blood and friendship?"</p>
               <p>"No; I could never be jealous or envious of you. You are a thousand times too good
                  for me, dear," returned Rosamond, passionately embracing her. "But, my word for
                  it, Luce, Sarah means mischief by coming here,—I saw it in her eyes; so be
                  careful, for you are a dove compared with her, my dear."</p>
               <p>Maybe Rosamond was right in her caution, and Sarah's visit was not so
                  disinterested after all. She was free now, and perhaps thought the boyish
                  preferences of Robert could be developed,<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC6133-00000046"/>
                  and so made Rosamond's return a cover for her attack.</p>
               <p>If this is what Rosamond meant, it was very creditable to her acuteness, though
                  not to her simplicity and innocence; for the woman that can search out another's
                  secret motives so well has not a guileless heart herself.</p>
               <p>And if this was Sarah's true motive in calling, how <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >malapropos</foreign> was <emph>my</emph> visit!—seeing the one she had lately
                  acknowledged as her lover the companion of him whom she designed for her next
                  lover must have rendered her plans abortive and made further visits
                  unnecessary.</p>
               <p>She was too self-possessed to betray it, however, and her visits were continued
                  almost daily; but as she seldom remained to tea, we did not often meet her
                  there.</p>
               <p>Autumn and winter had passed over, and as spring was slowly retreating before the
                  approaching summer, the family made preparations for moving out to the farm, which
                  they had not visited for years.</p>
               <p>Robert had accepted their invitation to make it his home during the summer, and I
                  had also pledged myself to go out from the heat and dust of the city and remain a
                  week or two with them whenever business would permit me.</p>
               <p>A similar promise was obtained from Sarah, who "in view of approaching old
                  maidenhood was learning to paint upon porcelain." These were Rosamond's words,
                  and, if they were intended to be sarcastic, they had failed, for they awoke a
                  feeling of interest and sympathy for her that would not have been known had she
                  been spoken of with praise or pity. Her father had not left his large and helpless
                  family in independent circumstances; and as she was the oldest of four sisters and
                  one infant brother, she felt it incumbent upon her to do something towards
                  self-sustenance. Perhaps some one has said before me that man is a conceited ape,
                  and will believe anything that flatters his self-love; but no matter whether it is
                  original with me or a dormant sentiment revived by memory, for the failing, though
                  as old as <emph>old Adam,</emph> is discovered by most men by acquaintance with
                  themselves some time in life, and discovered in them by all women at a very early
                  age.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps this is all for me, and Sarah has found that she loved even better than
                  she supposed, and now has no hopes that she can ever love again," were words which
                  I whispered to my vanity when I heard Rosamond speak of the provision Sarah was
                  making for "old maidenhood."</p>
               <p>They were followed by fears that I was too illiberal in making allowances for the
                  vagaries of love, which exacted at one time much more than it countenanced at
                  another. I used to argue that friendship, like the atmosphere, became light by too
                  much expansion, and when limited to a few the heart could love them better than
                  when divided between too many; but Sarah always contended that as the muscles were
                  developed and<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC6133-00000047"/> strengthened by constant
                  and varied exercise, so were the affections, and that loving a great many only
                  increased the heart's capacity for loving them better.</p>
               <p>She illustrated her principles by opening her heart to every handsome beau she
                  met, and demanded a like consistency from me by requiring me to keep my heart
                  closed against even sorrow for the death of a friend.</p>
               <p>Thus it seemed that no more than a sentiment had come between us; but it was as
                  hard to get over it as the "great wall of China."</p>
               <p>To return to the Davenport family: Robert and Rosamond had made several visits to
                  the farm to ascertain what repairs were necessary to make the house comfortable,
                  and found it needed much less than they had anticipated, as it had been in the
                  hands of a careful agent and a good tenant.</p>
               <p>At a family council, it was proposed to sell out all the furniture in the house in
                  town, after selecting family relics and such articles as would add to the comfort
                  of a country home, and then rent or sell the house, and make the one in the
                  country a permanent residence.</p>
               <p>This was discussed by the four who were considered one family,—Mr. Davenport and
                  Lucy against it, and Rosamond and Robert for it. Probably Mr. Davenport and his
                  daughter argued with themselves that when Rosamond got married they would have to
                  replace the furniture at a loss, and it would be better to close the house until
                  Fall, and move back again, so as to leave Rosamond free.</p>
               <p>The generous mistress did not think of that, I know, or she would have laughed at
                  their prudence; and Robert, economical and farseeing as he mostly was, might have
                  purposely overlooked it, for no one was paying Rosamond any attentions, and he was
                  getting quite fond of her himself.</p>
               <p>The question was settled by a compromise at last; the furniture was to be stored,
                  and the house rented for six months or a year, and the time for moving back left
                  open.</p>
               <p>The afternoon they had appointed for selecting and packing such articles as they
                  were to take with them was made known to Sarah and myself, and we both were on
                  hand to assist them. Robert and I attended to the books, while the young ladies
                  selected those things pertaining to housekeeping.</p>
               <p>Once or twice Rosamond came to caution us against forgetting those books in which
                  she was interested, and at last she was prevailed upon to stay with us. She was
                  silent and moody when with her own sex, but with us she resumed an account of her
                  adventures and feelings, which were characteristic of her fearless and somewhat
                  impatient disposition, and tinged with a satirical humor that made her a very
                  entertaining companion.</p>
               <p>Horseback exercise seemed to be especially her delight and <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >forte;</foreign> bareback, side-saddle, or, I believe, any way; and, as I
                  expressed my admiration and interest in her accomplishments as undisguisedly<pb
                     n="94-95" xml:id="VAC6133-00000048"/> as Robert did, she said she would insure
                  me a "gorgeous" time when I came out to see them, and would ride the wildest horse
                  in the country over the highest fences on the farm for my amusement. This led me
                  to say that I would be there often to see what I admired so much in a lady,—a firm
                  hand and a fearless heart.</p>
               <p>"The hand that can hold the reins firmly is firm in friendship, and the heart that
                  is elated at the prospect of adventure and danger, will never shirk the duties and
                  responsibilities of life when truth and affection are the horses," I said, widely
                  and wildly moralizing.</p>
               <p>I could not, however, have said anything more acceptable to her fancy, and she
                  adopted my words with such eagerness I thought she suspected herself to be wanting
                  in constancy, and was glad to get something to reassure her; but she then turned a
                  look so full of meaning upon Robert as she repeated my words, I guessed, in a
                  moment, that they had had discussions on the subject of her constancy, and thought
                  the conversation which had led to such a discussion must have been of a very
                  confidential nature.</p>
               <p>Her graceful form, which was wisely left to nature's moulding, was the
                  personification of health and beauty, and I could not wonder as she moved about
                  the library that Robert, who had a horror of those delicate females overcharged
                  with sensibility and nervousness, was hourly becoming more and more attached to
                  her.</p>
               <p>We were joined by the other two, and Rosamond repeated my speech to them, adding
                  that she thought it was as sound as it was original. Lucy laughed at it, and asked
                  whether I had arrived at that conclusion by analogy or observation; but an
                  expression of scorn and incredulity passed over Sarah's pale face, as if it were
                  too absurd to be repeated before any person of good sense, which, perhaps, it
                  really was.</p>
               <p>The expression only rested an instant, but long enough for both Rosamond and
                  myself to observe it; the two persons her politeness would fain have concealed it
                  from, for each one would take it all as a personal insult, being conscious of her
                  secret disdain.</p>
               <p>Rosamond's face, which was as readable as a book, betrayed so much resentment that
                  she was compelled to turn it aside lest we should see it, and the inherent rivalry
                  of those two cousins was not soothed by this interchange of expression.</p>
               <p>Robert had been silent on the new idea, so far, but now took sides against
                  Rosamond and myself, by saying that if there was truth enough in it to make it a
                  rule, yet he knew the exceptions would be quite numerous, and he thought the
                  present instance belonged to the exceptions rather than the rule.</p>
               <p>Though pleasantly said, Rosamond took it much to heart, and exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is just your way; you give me credit for nothing worth having, and if
                  Mr. Pearson had<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC6133-00000049"/> said it in connection
                  with any one else, no one would have been more ready to indorse it than you."</p>
               <p>He laughed at her pout, and replied,—</p>
               <p>"I grant it, because its weakness might not then have been so palpable; but in
                  yoking it with you he very awkwardly coupled its contradiction with it, and forced
                  an objection on my mind that might not have otherwise occurred to me until after I
                  had given it my assent."</p>
               <p>While Robert was joking, and in fact I said it as a mere gallantry, Rosamond was
                  in earnest from first to last, and said now, in an impatient tone,—</p>
               <p>"Robert, you know nothing of my character, notwithstanding your boasted knowledge
                  of human nature! Do you think I am fickle, Lucy?"</p>
               <p>"Well, no, I do not think you are, Rosy," said Lucy, with the manner of a witness
                  who was in doubt of the correctness of her own evidence, and thought it her duty
                  to give the prisoner the benefit of her doubts.</p>
               <p>But the prisoner did not notice the feebleness of Lucy's demonstration in her
                  favor, and exultingly exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"There, Lucy knows me better than any one else, for we do up each other's hair
                  night and morning; but I know where you get your ideas from: you get them from
                  what I sometimes say to tease you. I told you the other day of a girl who had
                  engaged herself to six men, and had promised to marry two of them on the same
                  week, which promise she kept with one, wearing at the wedding a set of jewelry the
                  other had sent her for his own nuptial adornment. You pronounced her a thief, and
                  said she ought to have spent her honeymoon in the State prison; which was very
                  harsh and ungallant of you, for you should have considered how often men are as
                  false and undecided to the very last moment."</p>
               <p>"No, I do not know of any instance I <emph>could</emph> consider; gallantry would
                  not forbid people to denounce such a base and false act if a man had done it, and
                  I think when it comes to a question of truth and honesty, it ought not to be
                  considered from such a standpoint."</p>
               <p>"And please, then, tell me what proof has a woman that the man she is marrying is
                  not as false and dishonest as this bride was?"</p>
               <p>"When a man asks a woman to marry him, he gives her a guarantee that he loves her
                  better than any one else, because, as Lamb says, he practically refuses every
                  unmarried woman of his acquaintance whom he does not ask, while <emph>he</emph>
                  has no evidence that she has, or would have, refused any one for him, or that he
                  would have been the object of her choice were they to exchange places with each
                  other! So this prerogative of man's has two drawbacks to its convenience: the
                  first is that he is in danger of being refused, and the next is that he may be
                  accepted—to be kept in reserve until a more eligible party is found to displace
                  him, or because no one else is expected to offer himself;<pb n="98-99"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000050"/> and the old maxim, 'If you can't get what you want,
                  then take what you can get,' seems a wise one."</p>
               <p>This brought the other girls up to Rosamond's aid; for the reputation of their sex
                  was menaced, and they attacked Robert's position with a united front.</p>
               <p>While Lucy denied his statement in toto, and said "<hi rend="i"/>Lamb was a wolf
                  in sheep's clothing." Sarah accepted it as fact, and adroitly used it to his
                  discomfiture, by saying that since custom and man's incredulity had denied to
                  woman the credit of a preference, he ought not to blame this girl for using five
                  other skeptics to prove to the one she married that he was really the man of her
                  choice.</p>
               <p>The labor of packing was closed with a festival, and next morning Mr. Davenport
                  and the two girls left the city, while Robert remained behind a few days to attend
                  to the storing of the furniture.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>THE discontentment Robert had felt, or feigned, the evening he exposed his
                  log-fire visions to me had at last become real and chronic. He had become tenderly
                  attached to Rosy Heywood, and fully aware that she was not exactly all his fancy
                  could paint her, being neither lovely nor divine in the strictest sense of those
                  terms, he was not satisfied with himself.</p>
               <p>She was unquestionably a fine, cheerful, ardent girl, one that any man who did not
                  look farther than twenty years ahead could see a good, suitable wife in; but
                  Robert looked fifty years ahead, and then beyond that into eternity, and Rosamond
                  appeared to be wanting in those qualities necessary for such a prolonged
                  companionship.</p>
               <p>But he had not power to withstand the aggressive character of such qualities as
                  she had, being exposed to them every hour, and at a place where she could revel in
                  that wild freedom so delightful to her and becoming to her peculiar temperament
                  and style of beauty. Lucy was very much confined by her father's indisposition,
                  for her cousin, however well disposed, was not thoughtful enough to lighten her
                  duties. As she was always cheerful and happy. Rosamond doubtless thought patient
                  nursing and parental society as well suited to her<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000051"/> disposition as active and exciting employments were
                  to herself, and was not, therefore, conscious of any selfishness in leaving Lucy
                  so much alone with her father.</p>
               <p>Robert was, therefore, with her a great deal; they walked together, rode together,
                  and sung together, and she laughingly excused her monopoly of his time by saying
                  that he was the only young man available, and the first beau she could catch out
                  there in the country should relieve him.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he thought there was some truth in her jest, and in their conversations,
                  which were always of that dangerous character peculiar to a couple who half love
                  and half distrust each other, he would, in the same spirit, accuse her of being
                  fickle and inconstant.</p>
               <p>She was too cunning to remain on the defensive, and would generally parry his
                  thrusts by charging the same character back on him; and then a truce would follow,
                  which each party would improve by blowing a trumpet in its own praise. In this way
                  she would assure him that she was the most constant creature in the world, that
                  she never forgot a friend, and that as he was the only one who had formed such a
                  poor opinion of her, justice to her demanded its surrender.</p>
               <p>A third party hearing some of their conversations might think she was forcing
                  herself on Robert; but he never had such a thought; for however unmaidenly her
                  words might appear on paper, they were greatly modified by the speeches which led
                  to them, and the light, careless tone they were uttered in. Robert, too, was
                  always the aggressor; for, as his knowledge of her character was not satisfactory
                  to him, he was anxious to hear her deny its accuracy, or even prove to him that
                  she was not more unstable than himself.</p>
               <p>She very often accompanied him on his sketching tours, and surprised him by her
                  insensibility to fatigue when they ascended the heights which surrounded the
                  farm.</p>
               <p>While he sketched she usually roamed about, gathering mosses, herbs, or wild
                  flowers; and if he had often laid his pencil down while she was absent, and gave
                  himself to thoughts wholly unconnected with his occupation, no one who knew the
                  strait he was in would blame him.</p>
               <p>Where all this would end, and whether it would end in anything, or in
                  disappointment to one or both, were questions which he often asked, but never
                  answered himself; for, not withstanding she engrossed so much of his time, he
                  still questioned whether he loved her, or whether it was not to circumstances,
                  rather than to choice, he was indebted for her society and friendship.</p>
               <p>Often he used to argue with me that love, marriage, and everything else were
                  governed entirely by circumstances; that a thousand women, which would suit a man
                  just as well as the one he loved, had been passed by mere accident, and were not
                  known to exist, merely because circumstances threw them apart instead of together.
                  But this<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC6133-00000052"/> theory did not satisfy him
                  now. Rosamond had no opportunities of seeing any one else, and judging how worthy
                  he was of her regard by comparison.</p>
               <p>He wished there had been some one to contend with him for her smiles, though his
                  natural modesty predicted the worst for himself if there had been. But no one, as
                  far as he knew, had crossed her sequestered path, and he was far too generous to
                  wish to profit by such a disadvantage to her.</p>
               <p>But, besides his doubts of there being love between them, and of her disposition,
                  hopes, and aspirations being such as he had hoped to find in a wife, there was one
                  more thought which seemed more oppressive to his feelings than all else.</p>
               <p>He was very independent, and, as a husband, would be very jealous of his
                  self-respect, and he did not believe that any woman could feel that she had made
                  her husband wealthy, and at the same time respect him. The fact might not occur to
                  her during the freshness of her love, but it would before they had been long
                  married; and feminine vanity would not think lightly of such a matter.</p>
               <p>If his income was enough to provide for her, so that her money was not wanted in
                  the family, and entirely at her own disposal, the trouble might be averted. But
                  Robert had always solved the marriage problem by the "rule of three," and could
                  never believe that plenty for one would be plenty for two.</p>
               <p>This state of things could not last long; for though, when alone, he made many a
                  resolution to avoid the subject of constancy, and look to his ideal to prove
                  Rosamond was not what he wanted, his heart betrayed him into the same speeches
                  every time they were together.</p>
               <p>One day he was amusing himself with his pencil, and Rosamond, becoming tired of
                  watching its movements, left him and stole up to a favorite horse, which was
                  resting on the sward. Seating herself on his back, and starting him from his bed,
                  she drove him round and round the field at a gallop. Robert dropped his pencil and
                  gazed enraptured at her as she made evolutions which would have done credit to a
                  Comanche. As she approached him, after making half a score circuits of the field,
                  with hair broken loose from its confinement, and flowing in dark chestnut waves
                  over her shoulders, her cheeks glowing and eyes flashing with exercise and
                  excitement, he lost all command of his prudence, and jumped up, overcome by his
                  admiration.</p>
               <p>"Come here, Rosy, and let me tell you something that ought to interest you," he
                  said, affecting a gay, careless tone, which ill accorded with the passionate
                  earnestness of his feelings.</p>
               <p>She checked the horse's speed, and using her hat, which she held by its strings,
                  to turn him, she walked him up to where Robert stood.</p>
               <p>He seized the hand by which she held the hat, and, bringing his other hand quickly
                  to her waist, drew her off the horse by main force.</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC6133-00000053"/>
               <p>"Not half so graceful as you could do it when a boy, Bob! Isn't it strange that
                  your sex always grow awkward as they grow old?" she said, attempting to free
                  herself as she touched the ground.</p>
               <p>As he still held her half caressingly, she looked into his face in surprise, and
                  saw reflected in it the struggle which raged in his breast, the desire to ask her
                  love and confess his admiration (for he did not even at that moment of excitement
                  think that he had so far given up his ideas of what he wanted in a wife as to say
                  at once he loved her), and the generous feelings that forbade him to speak of
                  it.</p>
               <p>After a moment he mastered his feelings enough to make a compromise, and
                  said,—</p>
               <p>"I have been very sad all day, Rosy, for an old man over there guessed at my age,
                  and thought me so much older than I really am, I fear that by the time I am rich
                  enough to get married no one will have me."</p>
               <p>"Pooh, nonsense! You will always be able to find some one glad to get you, Bob,"
                  she said, in a lively, reassuring tone.</p>
               <p>"Yes, maybe <emph>some one;</emph> but what kind of a one will she be, when I am
                  so old?"</p>
               <p>"A real nice one, too; such a one as you will like, I'll warrant you," she
                  cheerfully said.</p>
               <p>"You will guarantee that, will you, Rosy?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I will guarantee it," she confidently said.</p>
               <p>He was not saying just what he wished to say, for he thought if Rosy would wait
                  awhile he might have an income large enough to leave her portion out of the
                  question; but, at the same time, his generous mind cautioned him against asking
                  her to bind herself so long before he could marry her, and deprive her of the
                  chance of other offers for an uncertainty.</p>
               <p>Hoping he might be explicit enough to assure her of his love, and at the same time
                  leave her free to wait for him or to accept a better offer, he made another
                  attempt,—</p>
               <p>"I will never marry without consulting you, Rosy, if you will promise to give your
                  consent to my marriage with such a person as would suit me, no matter who that
                  person shall be."</p>
               <p>"Yes, you shall have her with my consent, whoever she may be, if she is worthy of
                  you, Bob," she unhesitatingly said.</p>
               <p>"I being the judge of that, of course?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no,—I being judge; for love is proverbially blind, and I should be sorry all
                  my life if I allowed you to marry one undeserving of the honor of being your
                  wife."</p>
               <p>He had not yet shaped his speech so as to leave himself bound and her loose; but
                  there was a steady, intelligent light in her eyes that satisfied him that he was
                  comprehended, and he exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"Give me your hand on that; it is a real <foreign xml:lang="LAT">bona
                     fide</foreign> bargain! I will never marry without your consent, and you will
                  not refuse the person of my<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC6133-00000054"/> choice to
                  me, when I get richer, and can afford to marry."</p>
               <p>"Yes, <emph>you have</emph> my hand on it," she said, laughing, seeing that he had
                  been holding both her hands for some time.</p>
               <p>He pressed them so warmly he could not know whether the pressure was returned ever
                  so slightly or not, and, drawing her arm within his, they walked up towards a
                  hill.</p>
               <p>"You see what you have done now, Rosy,—made yourself responsible in the eyes of
                  the law for a wife when I want her," he said.</p>
               <p>"Oh, but you would not go to law with me, would you, Bob?" she asked, as if
                  frightened.</p>
               <p>"You know you have, by guaranteeing me such a wife as I shall want, in a manner
                  indorsed a note which may be returned to you protested any day at all, and you
                  must pay it according to law," he said.</p>
               <p>Rosy was much interested in commercial forms and transactions, and, at this moment
                  getting an idea of what would be expected in a case of this kind, she said, with
                  an archness that pleased Robert,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, but you are bound by business principles to do all you can to get it
                  accepted by some one else before you fall back on me!"</p>
               <p>"I am bound by honor to ask no one to accept <emph>me</emph> whom I do not love,
                  or with whom you could not consent to my marriage; but I will be this liberal with
                  you: if you are married when I am rich enough to look for a wife, I will not keep
                  you to your bargain; you will have so many cares of your own you will not think of
                  me then."</p>
               <p>There was a few moments silence, and then Rosamond, who, perhaps, thought she had
                  let herself be entrapped too easily, said,—</p>
               <p>"You have fallen in love with some one you have seen lately, Robert, or you would
                  not ask my advice; perhaps you would like me to become your friend at court. Is
                  Sarah the favored one?"</p>
               <p>He was not so easily deceived; and, without answering the last clause otherwise
                  than with an impatient look, he said,—</p>
               <p>"No, Rosy dear, I need no friend at court, for I like courting well enough to do
                  my own share, and if I was not too poor to get married now, no one could more
                  willingly and energetically apply himself to the courting part; but I do not think
                  it is right to monopolize a girl's time and affections so long before marriage. No
                  one can tell what may happen; and, besides, our tastes are always changing, and a
                  girl should have the advantage of celibacy to the latest moment that she is denied
                  the security of marriage."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps she would not care whether you were rich or poor," Rosamond thoughtfully
                  said.</p>
               <p>"If I thought she did, I would not want her; but I care a great deal, for it is my
                  business to think of that; and both manhood and independence require that I should
                  be able to provide for her before I got her."</p>
               <p>"But she may have some money of her own,<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC6133-00000055"
                  /> and could get herself the extras, after you had provided her with the
                  necessaries; then you would not need to wait so long."</p>
               <p>Here was trouble with a vengeance, and he did not know whether to blame it on her
                  perverse coquetry or on the obscurity of his speeches; for he did not believe she
                  would be so forward as to make that proposition if she thought, or wished him to
                  believe that she thought, he had reference to herself. He had his choice now,—to
                  go over it all again, to please her coquettish disposition, or to let the
                  obscurity of his proposition conceal his feelings, and leave them both free from
                  any claim upon each other, leaving her real or pretended ignorance of his
                  sentiments towards herself to be used to cover his retreat. He chose the latter,
                  and said,—</p>
               <p>"No, Rosy; when I get a wife I shall expect to provide both the necessaries and
                  extras." And then made some careless remark upon the horse she had been
                  riding.</p>
               <p>But marrying was now even more interesting than equestrianship, and she was not
                  willing that he should change the subject; so she returned to it, with Sarah for a
                  medium of attack.</p>
               <p>"Sarah will be out here next week, and then you will be much happier than you are
                  now," she said, expecting to be contradicted.</p>
               <p>"Yes, very much," he replied.</p>
               <p>"Well, she ought to feel complimented, when I shall tell her how unhesitatingly
                  you have confessed it," she said, evidently disappointed by his answer.</p>
               <p>"You always liked her so much better than me; for she has not so many faults, and
                  can be more entertaining, besides."</p>
               <p>"Yes, a good deal," he replied, without knowing what she was saying, he was so
                  much occupied with his own bitter reflections.</p>
               <p>"Well, you are very much in love, indeed! She has everything you admire in a
                  woman, even that constancy which I am so sadly deficient in, and she is not half
                  such a heartless flirt as you think I am," she added, looking into his face with
                  affectionate interest.</p>
               <p>"No, Sarah is very fine; there are but few like her," he said, still looking up
                  the hill.</p>
               <p>"Well, indeed! I never heard so many ungallant speeches from your lips before!
                  What <emph>has</emph> come over you, Bob? You used to be so nice and complimentary
                  to me!" she exclaimed, at the same time trying to laugh, but failing, she was so
                  provoked at his acquiescence.</p>
               <p>Robert was wholly unconscious of the meaning of the words he had heard and
                  uttered; but had he had his wits about him he could not have chosen words to bring
                  her around more effectually; and without more attempts to rally him, she dropped
                  Sarah, as a tool that cut both ways.</p>
               <p>The conversation then became friendly and confidential, without alluding to what
                  had been said; and like brother and sister they walked along, sharing each other's
                  thoughts and hopes on almost every subject that interested them.</p>
               <pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC6133-00000056"/>
               <p>They wandered up the steep paths they had so often before climbed in search of
                  prospects, making each other happy as friends, and enjoying a respite from the
                  twitting and badinage of their gayer moods.</p>
               <p>Once or twice she had forgotten herself, and seemed to betray her knowledge of his
                  love and other acceptance of his proposition, once so openly and yet so
                  unconsciously that he could have clasped her to his heart for joy at his
                  success.</p>
               <p>They were talking of what was really essential to a happy life, when Robert, with
                  more romance than consistency, fell from an income of five thousand a year (the
                  sum he thought necessary half an hour before to get the "necessaries and extras")
                  to a hut upon those heights, where news of famines and failures, or wars and
                  rumors of wars, would never disturb him.</p>
               <p>"No, indeed! You are too active and ambitious to enjoy such an ignoble rest as
                  that, even with me, and summer all the year round; you could not be contented,"
                  she exclaimed, with her natural energy.</p>
               <p>He turned to thank her for so much candor, and to assure her that if he could wish
                  for more it was because he would want it for her and not for himself, when a
                  boyish voice, which had apparently been lately exercised in the recitation of his
                  lesson on natural philosophy, cried,—</p>
               <p>"Now, then, velocity versus gravitation!"</p>
               <p>They were standing near a rocky eminence, and as the words were shouted, a stone
                  as large as a good-sized teacup was hurled over the brow by an unseen hand.</p>
               <p>As Robert turned around it struck him on the thigh, and with a groan he fell to
                  the ground. The boy followed it to the edge of the rock, to witness the result of
                  his scientific experiment, but when he saw what had happened, he ran away as fast
                  as he could; probably not suspecting how much damage he had done, and fearing
                  pursuit.</p>
               <p>Robert attempted to arise, but finding the bone broken, he told Rosamond how
                  seriously he was hurt.</p>
               <p>"What can I do for you, Robert?" she cried, in anguish, as she saw the veins swell
                  on his forehead, through his efforts to appear calm, under the excruciating
                  pain.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Rosy, only to ask the boy who threw the stone to run for assistance,—it
                  is as little as he can do; and stay with me yourself, for you are better than a
                  thousand 'pain-killers,'" he said, not forgetting in his sufferings the joy she
                  had given him a moment before.</p>
               <p>She looked around for the author of the accident, but failing to discover him she
                  said she would go herself.</p>
               <p>As there was no other way of getting it he was obliged to consent, and she left
                  him on the ground and ran down the hillside as fast as its steepness would allow
                  her. The poor sufferer tried to keep his mind away from his pains by following her
                     with<pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC6133-00000057"/> his eyes as her lithe limbs
                  bore her away with the grace and swiftness of a leveret, and he even comforted
                  himself with the thought of being nursed by her while laid up.</p>
               <p>"She knows what I meant, and she understands that it is her wealth and my poverty
                  that compel me to postpone a more explicit declaration," he soliloquized, as she
                  was finally lost to his view in the valley; and having once considered her as his
                  future wife, he resolutely set his teeth on every fault he knew she had.</p>
               <p>The fears he had were that, as they held different views on nearly every subject,
                  they were not suitable to each other; that having from their earliest acquaintance
                  allowed themselves to use all their wits, skill, and powers to oppose, overmatch,
                  and circumvent each other, the force of habit would not let them live in peace;
                  and that as he always thought a woman with a Christian heart and temper the only
                  one he could consistently take to his bosom, Rosamond would be out of place
                  there.</p>
               <p>It had been a long and hard-fought battle, but love in the end had the victory,
                  and his scruples, resolutions, reasonings, and resistances lay dead now on the
                  ground beside him. Alas, a man in love is more to be pitied than one with his
                  thigh broken, even!</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>THERE was one person who had figured a good deal in my misunderstandings with
                  Sarah, but as it was before the time of the opening of the story, I have had no
                  occasion for mentioning his name before this. It was Dr. Leander Boynton, a
                  gentleman of fortune and leisure, who resided in the country or town, as suited
                  him; had studied medicine, and practiced or forgot it, as he felt inclined, and
                  rejoiced in the luxury of having no one's inclinations to consult besides his
                  own.</p>
               <p>As his country possessions were near those of Sarah's father, she and he were well
                  acquainted with each other, though she had always, with her own intellectual
                  attainments, looked upon him as a plaything to amuse herself with, or cast away
                  from her, as suited her mood. He was her cat's-paw when she wished to punish me
                  with jealousy; and she would go to lengths with him that her self-respect would
                  not let her attempt if he had been a better man—intellectually. When she wished to
                  justify herself, she would say that he was a "foolish fellow," whom she had known
                  for years before she had seen me, and therefore he could be treated any way with
                  perfect safety and immunity.</p>
               <p>He was the nearest, and in fact the only available, surgeon who could be found
                  when Robert was<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC6133-00000058"/> borne to the house on a
                  hastily-constructed litter by the men who had been called from the fields. There
                  are some fops who are disgusting for their vanity, but others who are infinitely
                  amusing, and Boynton belonged to the latter class, only there was nothing amusing
                  in his waiting to make a toilet of fifteen minutes' length after he arrived, as if
                  he was going to astonish a ball-room instead of to set a fracture.</p>
               <p>He was evidently aware that there were two young ladies in the house, having eyed
                  them at a distance several times; but as he had come to that neighborhood soon
                  after Sarah's father had won the farm, he had not had an opportunity of knowing
                  them. When he had set the bone, which had sustained a compound fracture, Lucy and
                  Rosamond met him at the door, and asked him what could be done to alleviate the
                  sufferings of the patient; and he replied, "Nothing but to remain near him, and
                  keep him amused."</p>
               <p>He meant Robert well, and added, that with such charming nurses a man ought to be
                  kept down as long as possible, and accompanied the compliment with a great many
                  bows.</p>
               <p>"I will write to Mr. Pearson at once to send out a respectable surgeon; Robert
                  ought not to be left to the skill of such an impertinent fop!" exclaimed Lucy, as
                  soon as the doctor was out of hearing; for his compliments were received with
                  still greater disfavor than mine were the first night I went with Robert to see
                  her.</p>
               <p>"Why, Luce, the man's professional skill ought not to be condemned because he
                  knows how handsome he is, or because he can make polite speeches," cried Rosamond,
                  who was laughing in her sleeve all the time he had been making his adieus.</p>
               <p>But his professional skill was at once condemned, and Lucy wrote to me about the
                  accident, and asked me to dispatch a good surgeon to them.</p>
               <p>I had not been out to see them up to this time, but had heard from Robert every
                  week, and was kept well informed in anything which could interest me.</p>
               <p>As I wished to avoid Sarah, and was informed when she was expected, I made
                  arrangements for visiting a few weeks later. Robert, who thought I had recovered
                  my misplaced affections, and was rapidly transferring them to Lucy, suggested that
                  the best time for my visit would be when Sarah was there, as she would, in a great
                  measure, increase my opportunities by giving Lucy time to walk out.</p>
               <p>Though I acknowledged he was right, I did not intend to profit by his suggestions,
                  for I was in no hurry to lay siege to Lucy's heart,—it was in safe keeping by her
                  father's couch; and, like a winter-apple, would become more mellow and enduring
                  for hanging long on the parent stem. Then, again, I was almost certain Lucy would
                  never get married as long as her father needed her undivided attention. Such a
                  thought as grieving the selfishness of aged infirmity by any step which would lead
                  him to fear an abatement of her care, would be<pb n="116-117"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000059"/> treason to the opinion I had formed of her dutiful
                  and self-denying spirit. It would be time enough for me to exert myself when the
                  present tenor of her life became changed by the recovery or death of her father,
                  or the appearance of a rival in the field; and, to be candid, I was not yet
                  prepared to say that I could fall in love again. I never expected or wished to
                  become as infatuated as I had been as Sarah's lover; for, when the fountain of
                  love, like a bottle of wine, is first opened, the pent-up fermentation of twenty
                  years sends out a good deal of foam and bluster, though the steady, sparkling
                  stream that is poured into the second glass may be far more desirable for having
                  thrown off its froth.</p>
               <p>I could have no doubt of being happy with Lucy if I thought she loved me, and I
                  loved her to begin with; but Sarah's miniature, with its exquisite beauty and
                  pensiveness, was yet in my possession, and against it and the recent change in her
                  deportment my heart was not yet steeled.</p>
               <p>One day we accidentally met at the angle of two streets, and turned in the same
                  direction; and, as friends of the Davenport family, we walked together some
                  distance, spoke about them, and wondered whether they would remain on the farm
                  through all the year; and, as we parted again, I told her I was not going out to
                  see them until after another fortnight.</p>
               <p>Next morning Lucy's note reached me, and after sending the surgeon to them, I made
                  arrangements ments for going out there myself that evening, and remaining until
                  the pain and fever of the fracture were over.</p>
               <p>As Lucy had suspected, the bone was not properly set, and Dr. Boynton's reputation
                  was not established in the family by his awkward performance.</p>
               <p>Though I have not given Rosamond a good character for sympathy, yet she did what
                  she could for Robert, and, between reading and talking, made the time less tedious
                  to him than it otherwise would have been. I sat up at night with him, and, with
                  Rosamond for a day-nurse, he had no reason for complaint. As Mr. Davenport was
                  getting strong again, he insisted that his daughter should leave him more alone,
                  and take some exercise for her own health, by becoming my guide through the
                  pleasant walks in the neighborhood. With her I took many a long walk, and her good
                  sense, delicate perception of what was sublime and beautiful in nature and
                  sentiment, made her company as dear to both hope and memory as a holiday was in
                  boyhood. But there was one charm about her that made her conversation and company
                  like an angel's to me,—I could believe every word she said, and this was much when
                  at that time I had not a perfect confifidence in the veracity of womankind. Sarah
                  was not strictly a liar, and I had never known Rosamond to tell a falsehood,
                  though she acted many; but yet I could not believe everything they said,—my mind
                  had become so skeptical; and, in<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC6133-00000060"/> making
                  allowances for human nature, my charity was almost exhausted by the wide margins
                  given to the statements I had heard made by my sisterhood.</p>
               <p>But every word Lucy said was received without the least discount for exaggeration
                  or artifice; and not only were her remarks, statements, and expressions taken at
                  their face-value in the spirit, but also in the letter; for as far as guile was
                  from her heart, so far from her lips was the folly of using the adjectives
                     <emph>glorious, splendid, elegant,</emph> and <emph>georgeous,</emph> until
                  they came to signify nothing except a paucity of words and ideas.</p>
               <p>Maybe I expatiate too much upon my heroine; but these days when I could believe
                  all I heard were the pleasantest of my life; and were to my much-deceived heart a
                  sweet foretaste of the time when all liars shall have their portions in the
                  burning lake, and only the true will be left.</p>
               <p>Nor was Lucy's good sense and truthful mind of that heavy kind which comes from
                  want of imagination, and is only a dull <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >fac-simile</foreign> of wisdom and truth: wise like the owl, because of its
                  stupidity, and unequivocal like the cuckoo, for having only two notes which it can
                  utter. Girls I knew who did not talk nonsense, and yet were not wise; who did not
                  utter falsehoods, and could not be called truthful, notwithstanding; but were mere
                  vapid, leaden negatives, enough to weigh down the spirit of any man who attempted
                  to be company for them.</p>
               <p>Lucy, on the contrary, was a most entertaining girl when thrown on her own
                  resources; lively, witty, and well informed; with a command of language that never
                  left her at a loss for a word, and an elasticity of mind that never left her dull
                  and exhausted, but rather gave its buoyant, spiritual vitality to every subject
                  which she touched.</p>
               <p>She could not climb the hills as sturdily as Rosamond could, for she was not so
                  robust; but then that was an additional pleasure for me, as it gave me the
                  opportunity of assisting her up, and then sitting by her side while she rested on
                  the green declivity.</p>
               <p>In a few days there was a bloom on her cheeks and a brightness in her eyes which
                  defied the art of Parisian counterfeiters; and her father, becoming proud of her
                  improvement, was the more anxious to keep her out, for it never occurred to his
                  simple heart that we might full in love.</p>
               <p>One day as we returned from our walk, and had crossed the rustic stile into the
                  lawn, a loud shout of,—</p>
               <p>"Hullo, Sally, here's your Ned!" welcomed us, and the next moment little five-year
                  old Tommy Carroll bounded up to me, scratching and climbing until he got his arms
                  around my neck.</p>
               <p>Sarah had arrived, and thinking from what I had said to her that I would not be
                  here for some time yet, she had brought her little brother out with her.</p>
               <p>Lucy was surprised when I told her who he was;<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000061"/> and to partly explain what I meant to clear up
                  altogether to her some time, I said,—</p>
               <p>"Sarah and I are old acquaintances, though if we had not met at your house last
                  year we would have forgotten each other by this time."</p>
               <p>She gave me a look of intelligence, which was, no doubt, eye language for
                  "lawsuit;" because that was the only reason for broken friendship that her
                  innocent heart could suggest to her.</p>
               <p>I took Tommy away with me, and went around the house, that Sarah might not have a
                  knowledge of his treason to make her visit unpleasant for both him and
                  herself.</p>
               <p>When I visited his sister I was a great favorite of the household pet, and
                  generally had something in my pocket for him.</p>
               <p>Some one had taught him to say "Bully for you!" and the united efforts of the
                  family could not break him from thanking me with those slang words.</p>
               <p>Removing the necessity of his thanks did not do, even; for when I was forbidden to
                  give him anything to call for them until he had given in, he still said it
                  whenever he saw me, either through gratitude for the past, or hope in the
                  future.</p>
               <p>When we had seen Sarah, now he cried,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, Sister Sally, see me with your Ned! I found him out here! Bully for you, Ned!
                  Bully for you! Bully for you!"</p>
               <p>With a look of dismay, she rushed up to him and shook him roughly by the arm,
                  exclaiming, angrily,—</p>
               <p>"You little plague, you! If you call Mr. Pearson Ned, or say bully for you, or
                  ever say that Mr. Pearson was at our house, I shall take you straight home again.
                  Do you hear me now, sir?"</p>
               <p>Poor little Tommy did hear, and, what was more to the purpose, he understood also;
                  for even at five years of age a boy "raised by hand" under four or five older
                  sisters will have a perception of "what's in the wind," especially if, like little
                  "Pip," he is not petted too much.</p>
               <p>As she looked up at me, she said that she had not expected to meet me, or she
                  would have left the little traitor at home, and I replied,—</p>
               <p>"He is not the only one you will have to silence, for I understand Dr. Boynton is
                  living near by, though I have not seen him."</p>
               <p>"Well, he is not as dangerous as Tommy," she said, with a look of conscious
                  power.</p>
               <p>At that moment Boynton entered the walk, and was met by Lucy on the porch. As we
                  came towards them he greeted Sarah at once, and would have as kindly remembered
                  me, but as Lucy introduced us he caught Sarah's signal, and the warmth of his
                  welcome was reduced to,—</p>
               <p>"Ah, Mr. Pearson, I believe I have heard of you often before, sir."</p>
               <p>"Yes; I am spoken of throughout the country, in the press and the pulpit, I
                  believe. 'We, the people of the United States,' and 'Us, miserable sinners.' are
                  the two names I am chiefly known to the public by," I replied.</p>
               <pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC6133-00000062"/>
               <p>They all laughed: Lucy, because she thought I had caught up the doctor in one of
                  his flattering speeches, and Sarah and the doctor (who now understood that I was a
                  stranger), at the turn I had given to his salutation.</p>
               <p>He had walked over to see how Robert was several times, though he knew that
                  another surgeon had been called in; but, as he had come while I was out with Lucy,
                  I had not until this time seen him.</p>
               <p>As he entered the parlor with Sarah and Lucy, I turned to Robert's room, for I was
                  afraid he would forget his cue at any moment, and betray how well acquainted he
                  was with me.</p>
               <p>Rosamond was with Robert, and, as I entered, she expressed a hope that I had
                  enjoyed my walk, and then, as I assured her that I had, a fear that between my
                  vigils and my long walks up the mountains with Lucy I would succumb to nature, and
                  become a patient too.</p>
               <p>I saw by the quizzical light that played in her eyes that she and Robert had been
                  speculating on my feelings towards Lucy, and, to turn the attack upon themselves,
                  I said that the danger was not as great as the temptation would be, if I could be
                  assured of having a book read to me with her devotedness.</p>
               <p>"If no one else had a better right, you may be assured that I would do it," she
                  said, with a frank smile.</p>
               <p>"Yes, you may be certain she would, Ned; the trouble is that she is such an
                  impartial, obliging girl, a fellow cannot flatter himself she is doing anything
                  for him which she would not do for any one else under the same circumstances,"
                  cried Robert.</p>
               <p>I do not think that Robert was jealous by nature, and, least of all, that he could
                  be jealous of Dr. Boynton; but Rosamond delighted in the fellow's conceit, and
                  encouraged him to believe he was making an impression whenever he called.</p>
               <p>"He looked as if he thought every glance penetrated my simple heart," she said
                  once, at the close of his visit; "and it did me good to see the side glance he
                  took of his whiskers as he passed by the mantel-glass."</p>
               <p>But, however much she had encouraged his calls and his compliments before Sarah
                  came, she did not waste much time bandying pleasantries with him for awhile
                  afterwards, for she suspected that Sarah had designs on Robert's heart, and she
                  evidently intended to refuse her consent to his marriage with <emph>that
                     girl</emph> before it was asked.</p>
               <p>Sarah was not long in perceiving that Rosamond had anticipated her, if such was
                  her hope, but did not seem to enjoy the air of her old home the less for that.</p>
               <p>If she came out on a matrimonial speculation, I think Dr. Boynton was the man most
                  likely to be the object of her honorable intentions just then, for he had some
                  qualities which a girl of Sarah's wit would not object to, viz., wealth, a want of
                  intellect that she could easily supply, and a good-natured<pb n="124-125"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000063"/> natured disposition that would not stand in the way
                  of her moods and fancies.</p>
               <p>A spy in the family had informed me before I had left the city that Sarah and her
                  stepmother had quarreled (the mother of the five younger children being her
                  father's second wife), the old lady having accused her of wantonly playing with
                  time, and having thrown away her matrimonial chances.</p>
               <p>All the admirers she had in reserve had made an ungallant retreat the moment they
                  found that she was freed from me, and one of themselves might be expected to step
                  into my place; for, however honorable their intentions were, they were not
                  matrimonial.</p>
               <p>The doctor was one of her oldest admirers, and had often, before I met her,
                  followed her from country to town; but he had become more attached to the country
                  air since I had left the way clear for him, and, as is often the case, the pursued
                  had turned and become the pursuer.</p>
               <p>Rosamond soon discovered where Sarah's objective point was, and, like an
                  enterprising young campaigner, took immediate steps for her defeat,—maybe as much
                  from a desire to test the power of "Twenty" against "Twenty-four" as from the
                  rivalry Providence had, according to her, ordained to compensate the human male
                  for the plumage and accomplishments denied to him—except by right of purchase.</p>
               <p>The doctor found himself suddenly between two sirens,—the happy recipient of both
                  their smiles,—and all he wanted was the recognition which Lucy withheld to make
                  him the favored of the Three Graces. But Lucy would not bow, and, Hamanlike, his
                  pain at Mordecai's contempt outweighed his pleasure at the adoration of the
                  others; so he was relieved from the embarrassment of choosing from between more
                  than two of the cousins.</p>
               <p>As has been the case on many a more sanguinary field, the energy and ardor of
                  youth soon triumphed over the strategy and experience of age; for, in a few days,
                  Sarah gave up the contest, and calmly resigned herself to the benevolent duty of
                  sharing Lucy's cares as nurse and housekeeper.</p>
               <p>This left Lucy free every afternoon to go out with me, while Sarah read to Mr.
                  Davenport; for though he protested against keeping either of them at home, Sarah
                  would find some good excuse for not being able to accompany us. Her considerate
                  goodness had made us more confidential, and one or two mornings I accompanied her
                  in the walks she took with Tommy.</p>
               <p>Perhaps Lucy thought Sarah's motives for not driving out with us were too
                  suggestive of a courtship; for sometimes she would refuse to go unless Sarah took
                  a similar recreation, and then Sarah would consent, but, when the time came, would
                  feign a headache, and send us off without her.</p>
               <p>Though Lucy did not suspect this fraud, it was well known to me; for I learned
                  that her headaches left her the moment we were out of sight,<pb n="126-127"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000064"/> and she read to Mr. Davenport nearly all the time
                  we were absent. But all her kindness could not get me along faster with Lucy than
                  the lapidist cuts into a diamond. We were as happy together as friends could be,
                  but nothing that approached love-making in its usual forms had yet been attempted.
                  I was at a loss how to attempt it, and my only hope was that we would some time
                  understand each other without the embarrassment of courting.</p>
               <p>After a time Robert no longer needed my assistance and watching, and I bade them
                  all, including Sarah, a reluctant adieu, bringing away with me convictions of
                  Lucy's matchless loveliness of character, purity of spirit, and beauty of
                  mind.</p>

               <p>IN about a week after I had returned to the city the junior who usually attended
                  to the mail cried out, as he came into the counting-room one morning,—</p>
               <p>"Here's a letter from 'Rustic S.' again; I haven't seen one of them for a
                  year."</p>
               <p>All Sarah's letters used to come to the office-box, and, being uniformly marked
                  with the initial S, formed by twisting a sprouting bough, they received the title
                  of "the Rustic S. letters" from the youthful wit who handed them to me.</p>
               <p>I cut the envelope open, but seeing that it contained several sheets, I put them
                  into my pocket for a more convenient season.</p>
               <p>The time arrived at last when I could read them without interruption, and this was

                           <p>"MY DEAR BUT INJURED FRIEND,—I am afraid the time is past when a
                              letter from me would be acceptable, and more especially do I regret it
                              when I am forced to confess that I alone am to blame for it. No one
                              who pretends to possess the instincts of politeness or humanity can
                              think without regret that a fellow-creature feels wronged or misused
                              by him, particularly when conscience is on the side of the offended;
                              and, as this is my case, the time has<pb n="128-129"
                                 xml:id="VAC6133-00000065"/> come when I can no longer defer asking
                              your forgiveness.</p>
                           <p>"I did not do it lately, when you were near, because I could not
                              extemporize words to say exactly what I wanted, and no more; and
                              because your gallantry would not listen to all I would say in
                              condemnation of my past life.</p>
                           <p>"Since you and I were friends, as the term goes, I have become another
                              creature; and, as God has forgiven a life of wickedness and rebellion
                              against Himself, I am sure you will forgive the few sins I have
                              committed against you. But, dear friend, while I mourn for the words
                              and actions which have separated us by so wide a gulf, do not think
                              that I seek to restore the relations once existing between us; for it
                              is my faults in allowing them to exist that I confess, and not the
                              breaking of them off, <emph>though I wish less violent and unkind
                                 measures had been used in doing it.</emph> And while, in obedience
                              to the divine command, which tells us to confess our sins if we want
                              to be forgiven, I send you the following pages, I must request you,
                              before I proceed with this confession, to neither seek an interview
                              with me nor address to me any acknowledgment of them.</p>
                           <p>"I will be assured of your forgiveness without it, for I know what a
                              good Christian heart you had to exchange for the miserably wicked
                              thing I had when I met you.</p>
                           <p>"And here I must begin my confession, for I had no heart of any kind,
                              as far as affection was concerned, when I accepted yours. <emph>I
                                 never loved you,</emph> and I blush for the dishonesty which
                              permitted me to pretend that I returned your honorable and sincere
                              attachment. If I sought an excuse for a sin that I bitterly repent, it
                              would be that I did not think you were deceived in me to a great
                              extent. Your frank reproofs assured me that you saw I was no angel,
                              and you had a mentor at your side who was not backward in prompting
                              you. You never told me that you had a confidant, but I knew you had;
                              and though I did not pretend to be without faults, yet I wanted the
                              man that loved me to be blind to them, and deaf also when a third
                              party enumerated and exposed them for purposes of his own.</p>
                           <p>"This accounts for the vacillation, fickleness, and uncertainty of
                              temper you so often with just cause charged upon me.</p>
                           <p>"Robert Heberton and myself had been friends from early youth, and
                              when Mr. Davenport and my father had become estranged by a lawsuit,
                              our friendship was not interrupted, as my uncle and his household
                              supposed. He visited me (privily, I afterwards learned), and continued
                              to pay me the attentions which I had with pleasure received from him
                              at his guardian's house, where I spent most of my time with my
                              cousins.</p>
                           <p>"We were finally engaged, but as he was too young in his profession to
                              think of a speedy marriage, we kept it a secret, and agreed to act
                              before others as if we had no claim on each other more than friends.
                              This agreement was understood to allow me to receive attentions from
                              other suitors,<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC6133-00000066"/> as if I was
                              free; but when our plan was reduced to practice, he became so
                              insufferably jealous and intolerant of a look or word from any one but
                              himself that we quarreled, and our engagement was broken off, a few
                              weeks before my father died.</p>
                           <p>"I soon lost trace of him; but a few months after you and I were
                              betrothed I was visiting my maternal grandmother, and she engaged an
                              artist to paint my picture.</p>
                           <p>"You can judge my surprise when Robert was introduced to me; but pride
                              came to my support, and, greeting him as an acquaintance, I determined
                              to sit as long and as often as was necessary.</p>
                           <p>"For awhile we were more reserved than if we had been total strangers,
                              but gradually our embarrassment wore itself out, and we conversed on
                              the pleasures and people of our previous acquaintance.</p>
                           <p>"He soon showed signs of returning to his former fealty, and, to
                              prevent a misunderstanding, I told him that I was engaged to you; for
                              I saw your handwriting in a letter he accidentally drew out one day,
                              and made him confess the writer's name.</p>
                           <p>"This had not the effect I had hoped for, however; he became angry
                              because I had not preserved for him the place in my heart which he had
                              so voluntarily resigned, and boasted how much truer <emph>he</emph>
                              was to his vows of eternal constancy; for such vows had often been
                              exchanged.</p>
                           <p>"As he immediately apologized, and seemed sorry for having spoken so
                              imprudently, not to say rudely, his speech made the deeper impression,
                              and I readily forgave the insult offered by thus addressing the
                              affianced of another; for you know how hard it is to blame a person
                              for loving you, even when there is selfishness and impropriety in that
                              love.</p>
                           <p>"After that he said no more in a serious way, but often rallied me on
                              being bound to another, and insinuated, while gallantly complimenting
                              me, how sensible he was of his loss, and what <emph>might have
                                 been,</emph> had I not placed a barrier between us, with greater
                              haste than romance allowed.</p>
                           <p>"The meeting left an impression that I could not efface from my heart,
                              and I discovered that I was only pleased with your character and
                              conversation without loving you. I long tried to conquer it, but it
                              was in vain; I was unhappy all the time, and you helped the insidious
                              poison by betraying in your frankness a knowledge of my vacillating
                              and dissatisfied nature.</p>
                           <p>"If you had only been blind to my failings and a slave to your
                              passion, I could have borne all; but you were neither, and I tried to
                              forget my disappointments by flirting with others, quarreling with
                              you, and gaining for myself a reputation for heartlessness that is far
                              from being satisfactory to me. You are not the one to betray
                              confidence, my friend, not even when so ill requited as you have been
                              by me; and I will confess to you that when I broke off our engagement
                              it was with full assurance of heart that Robert Heberton would renew
                              his engagement with me, as his words, and also his<pb n="132-133"
                                 xml:id="VAC6133-00000067"/> letters (one of which I inclose), led
                              me to hope he would.</p>
                           <p>"And again (to you in confidence), when I made Rose Heywood's return
                              to Mr. Davenport's an excuse for calling there, it was because I
                              thought that you and Robert were no longer friends, and he could not
                              be aware that you and I had separated.</p>
                           <p>"I was surprised to find you were a visitor there, but more surprised
                              to find how indifferent Robert was to the fact that I was free; and
                              now the end is at the hand, for Robert is engaged to Miss Heywood.</p>
                           <p>"When I saw his duplicity repaid by your kindness and care in nursing
                              him. I said it was my duty to inform you of everything when he no
                              longer needed your aid. And now, as he is getting well, you know
                              all!</p>
                           <p>"One closing request, in addition to the one I have already made, and
                              I am done: 'Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass
                              against us' is the prayer that I have but lately learned to know the
                              meaning of; but you have learned it long ago, my friend, and I am not
                              only sure that you will forgive me, but also Robert. Lay this letter
                              aside for two months, and do not seek Robert or write to him during
                              that time, and then you will be calm enough to review the whole thing,
                              if you like. Do not return Robert any letters he may write to you
                              before that time, as I will be here for some weeks yet, and you know
                              how embarrassing it would make my intercourse with him; for it is
                              desirable that we all should meet in harmony for my uncle's and Lucy's
                              sake. Good-by forever, and Heaven bless you!</p>

               <p>When I had ended reading it, the perspiration was standing in large beads on my
                  forehead, and I was almost deprived of the power of walking to a seat, for I had
                  read it while standing up against a bale of goods.</p>
               <p>Poor, injured Sarah! how I felt for her then! The misfortune, the sorrow, the
                  repentance were hers, but the sin and the blame Robert's and mine!</p>
               <p>She had never loved me, and I liked her now the better for that; she had a heart
                  that loved too well for her happiness, and I did not believe that of her before. I
                  must have wearied her almost beyond human endurance; for how dull and distasteful
                  must the expressions of love be to one whose heart is given to another than the
                  speaker! I was surprised that she could have borne it so long, and it was a wonder
                  I did not make myself forever obnoxious before she threw off the yoke which must
                  have been so galling to her.</p>
               <p>This accounted for the picture of her I had found in Robert's possession, though I
                  had supposed that to be accounted for on two occasions already; but it shows how
                  often the truth can be told, and yet leave a false impression.</p>
               <p>The letter, which I suppose she sent to certify her story, was an obscure
                  composition, just such a non-committal note as Robert could write. It spoke<pb
                     n="134-135" xml:id="VAC6133-00000068"/> of friendship which time could not
                  change or lessen, and of faith in the eventual triumph of the first true love,
                  though obstacles seemed then to be heaped up between them by conspiring fates. The
                  rhapsody was sickening for its unmeaning rant, and worthy of the pen and bombast
                  of a high-school lover, rather than a young man of Robert's age and intellect.</p>
               <p>Alas, this was the friend I had thought the soul of truth and honor, the one of
                  all others before whom I had cast the pearls of my heart to be trampled under
                  foot!</p>
               <p>I well remembered the letter to which she had reference, for I sent it to him with
                  a letter of introduction to her when I learned they both were sojourning in the
                  same village, hoping that both would have a pleasanter visit by becoming
                  acquainted. But he returned it to me with a show of thankfulness, and not only
                  declined every offer I had afterwards made of introducing him, but tried to
                  undermine my confidence in her by sarcastic generalities, his knowledge of her
                  character often enabling him to surprise me by the pertinence of his
                  philippics.</p>
               <p>There were no bounds to my indignation, for the more I thought of it the greater
                  dupe I became in my own eyes; and the feeling that a man has been a fool, and
                  others have seen his simplicity and taken advantage of it, is not a pleasant
                  one.</p>
               <p>And Sarah, who had been more misused than I, how meekly she bore it all! Six of
                  the best years of her life wasted between a knave and a fool, and yet she could
                  forgive! She had indeed become changed, when she could confess her errors to me,
                  and meet the wretch who was the cause of them every day as a friend.</p>
               <p>As the gratification of seeking her or writing had been forbidden to me, I could
                  do nothing but praise her newly-found Christian spirit, and hope that the Friend
                  of the Fatherless would be her protector.</p>
               <p>She was, no doubt, afraid I might think she was desirous of renewing our
                  engagement if she did not peremptorily forbid me to address her; but I would never
                  have suspected that; she had helped me to be in Lucy's society enough to shield
                  her from suspicion, and how could I hope that she could love me now, when she had
                  confessed that I had never been loved by her?</p>
               <p>For one week my mind was wholly occupied with this better experience; every book
                  or writing I looked over conveyed the black crime of treachery to my mind;
                  everything else seemed but a dream, and this was the one great reality that
                  haunted me in business, in society, and in sleep. The hum of voices had treason
                  and deceit in it, the streets were filled with faces that reflected the malice and
                  guile of the human heart, and I spoke to my most intimate acquaintances as
                  guardedly as if I knew they were plotting my hurt, and every word they drew from
                  me would be at some future time used as an instrument to torture me with.</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC6133-00000069"/>
               <p>"They are all treacherous, every one is treacherous, everything is treacherous!" I
                  would say, as I walked through the crowds and viewed men with the grim
                  satisfaction of knowing them to be knaves, and myself the only one among them who
                  could hold up his face and say it was not a double one.</p>
               <p>I avoided my friends, I gave myself up to morbid meditations, and I brooded over
                  my miseries until I felt a satisfaction in having them for mine.</p>
               <p>At the end of two weeks a letter addressed in Robert's handwriting was handed to
                  me; but as Sarah's commands were dear to me, I laid it away, instead of returning
                  it to him with the contempt I felt for the character of the writer.</p>
               <p>As he did not suspect how well I had learned to know him, I thought it would
                  inform me of Lucy's feelings towards me if I opened it; but even Lucy could be
                  nothing to me after this. I had been evidently introduced to her by her
                  unscrupulous friend in hopes that my mind would be diverted from Sarah; and,
                  however innocent <emph>she</emph> was, to follow the destiny he had plotted for me
                  was out of the question. Marrying for friendship does not seem a hard sacrifice
                  when a person has been disappointed once or twice in love, and sometimes I
                  thought, with a martyr-like resignation, that it would be the best thing that
                  Sarah and I could do now, since all things had conspired to make the dream of love
                  a delusion to us both.</p>
               <p>A fortnight afterwards another letter from him was handed to me, which was laid
                  aside with its fellow; four days afterwards another, and in four days more a
                  fourth.</p>
               <p>The last two were addressed to different places, with a request written on the
                  corner of each envelope to forward if I was not at home. Still, I did not open
                  them, as I intended to return them all as soon as the two months' grace Sarah had
                  asked for were fulfilled. I naturally supposed that some unusual events were
                  transpiring on the farm,—Rosamond getting married to Robert or the doctor; Mr.
                  Davenport dead, or on the point of death; or, may be, Lucy discovered, and already
                  half-won by some fortunate neighbor.</p>
               <p>As I had promised, when returning to town, to go back to them soon and take a real
                  vacation, I flattered myself that they were inquiring among themselves why I was
                  not coming out, and wondering why Robert's letters were not answered.</p>
               <p>"Does Lucy miss me?" was asked in my mind repeatedly, but never answered; for,
                  though with my late information I had taught myself to look upon her henceforth as
                  a stranger, I was not prepared to be in so short a time as though <emph>I never
                     had been,</emph> to her pure and innocent heart.</p>
               <p>Some one who pretends to understand the female sex (and all pretend to it except
                  those who know them best), says that it is better to offend a woman than let her
                  have no cause to remember you at all, as your chances of winning an interest in
                  her heart will be better in the end; and I was willing at<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000070"/> present to let Lucy have my unaccountable absence
                  as a subject for thought; because my last words to her were assurances of a speedy
                  return, and a resumption of our walks and drives.</p>
               <p>Rosamond would rally her upon scaring me away; for it would be impossible for that
                  irrepressible girl to neglect so good an opportunity of twitting any one she cared
                  for; and this would set Lucy to reviewing all that had passed between us with
                  thoughtful and distrustful scrutiny.</p>
               <p>I would have taken my summer vacation and gone home to forget my sorrows; but
                  female relatives have sharp eyes, and I could not escape those of my mother and
                  sisters. They were acquainted with the virtues and talents I had praised in my
                  friend, and he would be the first person they would ask of; and I could not bear
                  to tell them how mistaken I had been. They would not be so charitably disposed
                  towards Sarah; for they did not seem to appreciate her at any time, and were glad
                  when I was free from her. Her cold self-possession had not made a good impression
                  on them, and Robert had their everlasting gratitude when I told them how steadily
                  he had refused to be introduced to her, and yet was prejudiced as themselves
                  against her.</p>
               <p>I was glad that he did not know of this, as he would undoubtedly have laughed at
                  their simplicity, as he did at mine, while he was playing such a deep-laid
                  game.</p>
               <p>I was thus compelled to live in my own company, and very gloomy company it was
                  during those days. I could almost hate myself for my inconstancy in regretting the
                  loss of both Sarah and Lucy at the same time, and I could welcome my woes and
                  disappointments if Robert had not been the cause of them.</p>
               <p>I was so constantly and deeply impressed with my folly and imbecility that groans
                  would escape my lips as I walked along the streets, and people would turn and look
                  at me as if they thought I was suddenly taken with cramps or colic; so that
                  mortification in public was added to my private woes, and only for the horror
                  human nature has of losing its identity, I would willingly exchange persons, past,
                  present, and future, with the smallest boot-black I met on the sidewalks.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>LETTERS had ceased coming, and I began to get impatient, anxious, and curious,
                  knowing that there had been some unusual excitement on the farm, but not knowing
                  whether it was all over now, or what it had been.</p>
               <p>I took the tempting but forbidden messengers in my hands several times each day,
                  as if expecting the news would sprout through; but I did not break a seal. At last
                  the writer himself arrived in a hack, and limped with a cane as he stepped out of
                  it. He was driven to my boarding-house as I was going to tea; and, like the
                  Bedouin, I felt it my duty to offer him my hospitality, even though I should
                  waylay and kill him afterwards.</p>
               <p>As I offered him my unwilling hand, he impatiently exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"What in the name of common sense has kept you from answering my letters? Did you
                  not get them?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, and have kept them as good as new for you; and you shall have them as soon
                  as you get up to my room," I answered, sulkily.</p>
               <p>He looked vexed and surprised, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Well, you appear to take things very calmly! I suppose you were not at all
                  interested in what I wrote you?"</p>
               <p>"What did you write that should interest me, pray?"</p>
               <p>"Didn't you read my letters?" he asked.</p>
               <p>"No, not one of them; they are all kept inviolate for you," I doggedly
                  answered.</p>
               <p>"Well! what under the heavens has bewitched you? Not opened my letters; and not
                  acquainted with what has been transpiring the last four or five weeks,—not knowing
                  how much yourself was concerned!" he cried.</p>
               <p>"What has transpired in which I am so deeply concerned, please?" I asked.</p>
               <p>"Oh, nothing, except that Sarah has blackened you pretty well, stole a march on us
                  all, and inveigled Mr. Davenport into marrying her," he said, with contemptuous
                  carelessness.</p>
               <p>"Blackened me, and married Mr. Davenport! what do you mean?" I cried.</p>
               <p>"That Sarah has been playing a very deep game, sending Lucy out with you and
                  afterwards telling her father that she was about to desert him and elope with you.
                  Why, the arch-fiend is not deeper or more deceitful; and you have helped her to
                  deceive Mr. Davenport by keeping away, notwithstanding all my efforts to get you
                  out there to explain."</p>
               <p>I was thunderstruck, for the whole plot flashed upon me in an instant; and I said,
                  more in justification of my credulity than as an article of faith, after this
                  proof that her penitence and confession were false from first to last, and only
                  made to deceive me,—</p>
               <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC6133-00000072"/>
               <p>"Why, how can Sarah be guilty of such a crime against truth and honor if she is a
                  converted Christian girl, as she says she is?"</p>
               <p>"Did she tell you she was a <emph>converted Christian,</emph> and did you believe
                  her, Ned?" he asked, with a look of ineffable scorn.</p>
               <p>"Yes; and is there anything impossible in that? Could not God convert her?" I
                  asked, trying to justify the act of grace as a possibility rather than as a
                  fact.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I suppose God could, if he pleased; but Satan leads her now by the right
                  hand. There never was such a cunning devil. Why, it seems she imposed upon you by
                  talking about conversion and Christianity, because you had faith in God if you had
                  none in herself, and she knew you would be thrown off your guard by such a story
                  of grace. Oh! she would doubtless be an angel if she had not been predestinated to
                  be a something else! Yes, indeed; transforming herself into an angel of light that
                  she might the more easily deceive!"</p>
               <p>I had by this time got all the letters in my hand, and I gave him Sarah's letter
                  to read, while I hurriedly tore open the four it had laid embargo on.</p>
               <p>From them I learned how the plot had progressed, for Robert wrote me in the most
                  earnest terms to come out as he had detected it at its different stages, but could
                  not leave his room to come to me in person.</p>
               <p>Robert read Sarah's letter very attentively, and said, while he glanced over it a
                  second time, as if counting the pages,—</p>
               <p>"Well, there is nothing so remarkable about that, unless that it is partly truth,
                  always excepting the penitential part; for I believe there is as much hope for the
                  repentance of Lucifer as for Sarah's; and when she has counterfeited the currency
                  of grace to pay the Devil with, the gentleman in black may well tremble for his
                  reputation.</p>
               <p>"She had quarreled with her stepmother, and had resolved to leave the house, and
                  instead of seeking me, who had no house to give her, I think she came to Mr.
                  Davenport's only for the purpose of following Dr. Boynton out to the farm.</p>
               <p>"She made a friend of you by the many ways she contrived to send Lucy off along
                  with you; but, taking her place by Mr. Davenport's side, she took care, with her
                  usual tact, to serve her own ends too.</p>
               <p>"The doctor would not be caught, and she next turned to Mr. Davenport as the only
                  one available who had a home to shelter her, and she succeeded better.</p>
               <p>"While you were out there she contented herself by saying occasionally that you
                  and Lucy were growing quite fond of each other, and that she did not partake of
                  your recreations because she liked the duties of nurse; but when you came away she
                  ventured further, and poisoned his mind by insinuating that he must expect to be
                  deserted by his daughter for a husband.</p>
               <p>"He heard her with so much confidence and<pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC6133-00000073"
                  /> credulity she was encouraged to become more positive, and unfolded to him a
                  plot between you and Lucy to elope, and come back to ask his forgiveness when it
                  would be too late for him to plead his infirmities and his need of her
                  society.</p>
               <p>"She pleaded in extenuation how natural it was that Lucy should be tired of
                  nursing and seclusion, and become infatuated with the hopes of a new and exciting
                  life with you; and said that the marriage was to take place without his sanction,
                  because you thought he was too selfish to consent to it. This aroused him
                  thoroughly, and he determined rather than be the cause of an elopement, or the
                  obstacle in the way of his daughter's welfare, to relieve her of the duty of
                  nursing him.</p>
               <p>"He was so convinced of being regarded as a hinderance to her settlement in life,
                  and of her determination to marry without showing him the respect due to a
                  guardian even, that he almost became deranged, and gave her no opportunity of
                  exculpating herself; but rather rejected every office she tried to perform, until
                  her heart was almost broken by his morose and repulsive bearing towards her.</p>
               <p>"I alone knew what had made the mischief, because he reproached me one day for
                  having ever introduced you into the family; but all the assurances I could give
                  him of the groundlessness of his fears did not avail, for no one but yourself or
                  Lucy could deny it, and he forbade me to mention it to either Lucy or
                  Rosamond.</p>
               <p>"You did not come out in response to my repeated peated solicitations, and your
                  absence led him to suppose you were making preparations for the elopement, which
                  made him hasten his own marriage to prevent it.</p>
               <p>"How he could ask the niece of his wife to marry him is a mystery, but I suppose
                  Sarah had informed him that she would not let him be uncared for, and he saw no
                  other way to leave Lucy free to marry and permanently supply her place.</p>
               <p>"Though I had a week's notice of it, the contemplated marriage was not announced
                  to the girls until one hour before it took place, and they were merely summoned to
                  witness it, with as little ceremony as if subpœnaed to a court.</p>
               <p>"The grief of Lucy and the indignation of Rosamond was as violent as their
                  astonishment was complete, and they have not become reconciled to it yet, though
                  the married couple are now off on the mockery of a wedding tour. Resentment must
                  have made Mr. Davenport strong, and I hope he will remain so long enough to find
                  out what an old fool Sarah has made of him, and pay her for it."</p>
               <p>"Yes, indeed, she has made an old fool, and a young one, too. Oh, can I feel my
                  humiliation as I should? I could have stopped all this if I had been bright and
                  reasonable enough to consider how incredible her story was," I exclaimed,
                  penitential now when my folly was all paraded before me.</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I could if I had done my duty," he replied; "for I do not think I ought
                  to have left Lucy ignorant of what I knew, even at the express<pb n="146-147"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000074"/> command of her father. But with regard to this
                  letter. I can tell you in a few words what truth there is in it, for there is some
                  truth very cleverly woven into it: she was born a romancer. I did not cease to
                  visit her when the lawsuit divided the families, for, without being capable of
                  feeling a passion herself, she could inspire one you well know. One evening as I
                  was placing a ring on her finger with a wish, I playfully tried it on the right
                  fore one, telling her that if I could get it on that one once she would be
                  virtually engaged to me, and nothing could save her.</p>
               <p>"She calmly replied that she was in no danger, because the ring was too small for
                  that finger, and that I knew it.</p>
               <p>"I got her consent to try to force the ring on, and her promise to be my mine if I
                  succeeded; and evening after evening, as we sat by the grate, I tried to get the
                  ring over the joint, more for the boyish delight of holding her handsome,
                  well-shaped hand than with a hope of success.</p>
               <p>"At last a strategy occurred to me, and I bought a cheap plated ring, a size
                  larger than hers, but like it in appearance; and, with a thought only for fun, I
                  took it with me the next evening I visited her.</p>
               <p>"As we sat by the fire chatting as usual, I took her ring off, and slyly
                  substituted the plated ring for it, while she was showing me a new book of
                  engravings.</p>
               <p>"'Well, Sarah, I suppose it is a standing bargain that if I get <emph>this</emph>
                  ring on your engagement finger you will marry me?' I said, with affected
                  carelessness.</p>
               <p>"I had, however, without intending it, emphasized 'this;' and, noticing it, she
                  looked up from her plates, eyed the ring a few seconds, but, without seeming to
                  detect the fraud, she calmly said 'Yes,' and then turned her attention to her
                  pictures. In a moment I pushed it over the second joint, and, dropping her hand, I
                  clasped her head to my heart, crying,—</p>
               <p>"'My bride! my bride! I have won you!'</p>
               <p>"Calmly begging me not to disarrange her hair, she took the ring from her finger,
                  weighted it carefully in her hand, and requested me to give her back her own ring,
                  as it was much finer gold.</p>
               <p>"I was allowed, however, to conduct myself as her betrothed when no one was
                  present; but I was no more than a 'boy' when an older beau was available.</p>
               <p>"The joke about the ring soon became stale, and we both dropped allusion to it,
                  and, as other beaux came into the field, I kept out of their way, and finally
                  ceased to visit her altogether. There was no quarrel or ill feelings; but, hearing
                  Mr. Davenport express himself very strongly against her family, I thought it was
                  no better than deceiving him to visit the house.</p>
               <p>"It was then I wrote that letter, which, you can see, looks somewhat yellow, with
                  the date recently inked, as she has changed the 3 into an 8,<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000075"/> and made its date five years later. You may decide
                  for yourself whether she was engaged to me or not, for it does not now
                  signify,—neither of us can have her.</p>
               <p>"After I had ceased visiting her I did not see her again until I met her when
                  employed by her grandmother to paint her picture.</p>
               <p>"She had nothing to do but flirt with country beaux then, which she pronounced the
                  dullest fun in creation; and she tried how far her old blandishments had power
                  over me yet. I told her she was engaged, but she denied it; whereupon I produced
                  your letter and silenced her. Since then you have often entertained me with her
                  perfections; but I did not tell you all I knew about her, as I thought you would
                  gradually learn to know her real character, and would be better satisfied with
                  what you found out for yourself. We both see her in a new <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >rôle</foreign> now; the witty and fascinating belle has retired in disgust,
                  and become a patient, secluded nurse."</p>
               <p>"Well, what shall we do now, Robert? or do you refuse to do anything in connection
                  with such a senseless dupe as I have become?" I asked, as he had ended his
                  story.</p>
               <p>"I do not know what we can do, Ned; they are married, and that cannot be helped,
                  though it could have been helped once, if I was only able to come to town, or you
                  had opened my letters," he returned.</p>
               <p>"I can see Mr. Davenport the moment he comes back, and clear myself and Lucy, and
                  let him know by what means his wife kept me away, while she slandered me to him,"
                  I said.</p>
               <p>"No use in that, Ned,—she is Sarah no longer; and you will only make both Lucy and
                  her father miserable by telling the one how much he has been bamboozled, and the
                  other how readily her father gave ear to the foul story of a home-seeker," he
                  said.</p>
               <p>"Well, what then? what do you propose? for something <emph>must</emph> be done to
                  clear up all this. Why, is it right that she should be enjoying the success of her
                  treachery, and Lucy and I should still be suffering the unjust suspicions she has
                  cast on our characters?" I cried, dropping into a chair.</p>
               <p>"You cannot prevent her from enjoying her success, such as it is; she has a home,
                  and Mr. Davenport could not turn her out of it, even if he knew all; and as for
                  you and Lucy, that matter will mend itself, for her father will soon see that
                  there was no intention of leaving him, and will merely think Sarah was mistaken.
                  Except in a case of treachery, like taking her away without his consent, I have no
                  doubt he would be glad to look upon you as Lucy's future protector; and I know, if
                  this came to her ears, she would never forget that her father's heart was turned
                  from her by the thought that she was to be married to you," he replied.</p>
               <p>This had some influence with me; for, almost simultaneously with my discovery of
                  Sarah's duplicity, my recent feelings towards Lucy returned, and, though the
                  knowledge of our joint implication in the elopement plot made her dearer to
                     <emph>me,</emph>
                  <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC6133-00000076"/> I knew that <emph>her</emph> sensitive
                  mind would be differently affected by it.</p>
               <p>Robert remained with me that night; and, as next day was to be celebrated as
                  Rosamond's twenty-first birthday, he was the bearer of an invitation for me to go
                  out and celebrate it with them. This placed me in a delicate situation, for I
                  could not refuse to go without offending her; and, at the same time, if I visited
                  there during Mr. Davenport's absence, after having remained away while Sarah was
                  weaving her net so skillfully around him, he would certainly hear of it, and it
                  would accord too well with what he had heard before. We debated the question
                  between us all the evening, and finally decided to take the risk of bringing the
                  matter to an issue, and expose as much of Sarah's mendacity as would justify
                  myself, and give me the privilege of seeing Lucy with the same freedom that I had
                  enjoyed the time I was out there last. Robert was of opinion that Mr. Davenport
                  would never know how much his wife had deceived him, but would merely think, after
                  he had discovered his suspicions were unfounded, that she had been misinformed,
                  or, at most, had been over-officious in the affair.</p>
               <p>The couple expected to be away two weeks, and had left the girls so overcome with
                  surprise that they were glad of the opportunity their absence gave them to
                  interchange thought freely, and determine what had been the cause of the marriage,
                  and what was their duty in regard to it.</p>
               <p>Soon after tea that evening, Robert put a fifty-dollar bill into my hand, and
                  asked me to go out to a jewelry store and invest it in a pearl ring for Rosamond's
                  birthday-present.</p>
               <p>I knew, of course, that choosing an engagement-ring was what the lover himself
                  would like to do; and, going to a store in which a friend of mine was salesman, I
                  got a dozen of the most stylish, and took them to Robert, that he might make the
                  selection himself.</p>
               <p>During the season he was laid up by his accident Rosamond had been good to him,
                  and had not objected, at any time, to be considered as his betrothed, though
                  nothing more had been said to remove the ambiguity of their relations to each
                  other.</p>
               <p>And now, when he was making her a birthday-present, he took the measure of her
                  forefinger, and selected a ring for it which she would at once recognize as the
                  seal of their betrothal; and, by accepting, give a tacit consent.</p>
               <p>I will not deny my own foolishness in that I was sorely tempted to get a like one
                  for Lucy, though on speculation, as I had not the same assurance Robert had that
                  it would ever come in use.</p>
               <p>We left the city early in the morning, and before noon arrived at the farm, where
                  a flag had been hoisted to the turret of the house by the fair mistress, in honor
                  of the day.</p>
               <p>But though the fluttering of the stars and stripes outside betokened a merry
                  occasion, inside the girls looked sad and disheartened enough.</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC6133-00000077"/>
               <p>The subject that occupied their thoughts could not be suppressed long; and soon
                  after the first greetings were exchanged, Rosamond told me of their amazement when
                  called to witness the ceremony, and their inability to account for its
                  necessity.</p>
               <p>She declared, with a doleful countenance, that it would be unreasonable of Mr.
                  Davenport to expect her and Lucy to yield to Sarah the obedience and respect due
                  to a mother; that she would be in the house all the time, assuming matronly airs,
                  and, maybe, would talk of sending them to a seminary to finish their
                  education.</p>
               <p>As this was said by one who was her own mistress, and the owner of the house
                  besides, it is probable that her dislike to the domineering disposition of Sarah
                  was greater than her fears of being interfered with in her own rights, and Lucy
                  intimated that much.</p>
               <p>"Assuredly, I do not fear for myself, for she knows I am not meek or submissive
                  enough to be imposed upon; but it is for you, my dove-eyed Luce, that my
                  sympathies and fears are aroused; and if I was you, I would never give her a civil
                  word or myself a day's rest until I found by what means she has usurped your place
                  in your father's heart; for we all know that she has prejudiced his mind against
                  you, and he has scarcely spoken to you for a month," she exclaimed.</p>
               <p>Rosamond doubtless thought I was more intimate with the family affairs than Lucy
                  did, for she appeared mortified by hearing the lamentable fact mentioned in my
                  presence, and she replied, while unwilling tears attested how keenly she felt the
                  slight his sudden and unnecessary marriage inflicted upon her,—</p>
               <p>"No, Rosy, my father is justified by everything but the necessity in doing what he
                  has done. No one can deny that he had a right, legally and morally, to marry her;
                  and though I am selfish and self-willed enough to wish it otherwise, he shall
                  never, by a word or look of mine, have cause to regret that he has done so."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is just what I thought; you will submit, and become second fiddle in
                  the family discord! <emph>I</emph> tell you I would be the first, and make their
                  ears tingle if they tried to push me out of my position as lady of the house; for
                  your father, by the wrong he has done you, has forfeited all claims to your love
                  and obedience!" she exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Rosy, how wildly you talk! My father has done me no wrong, I repeat, for I am
                  not his wife that I should feel injured by his marrying another. I am much bound
                  as I ever was to honor and obey him, and I cannot complain if his wife will be
                  more in his love and confidence than I; she would be wronged if she was not," Lucy
                  replied.</p>
               <p>"Well, let us have a picnic this afternoon, or do something to make Mr. Pearson's
                  visit more pleasant to him; for all I can say is that it is well for Mrs.
                  Davenport she has not me for a daughter instead of you, as I would let her see
                  that she could not<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC6133-00000078"/> take the inside
                  track of me with impunity, or keep it without a struggle that she would find both
                  arduous and long. Your father has injured you by marrying; for he has taken
                  another in between you and himself, not only to divide with you, but also to
                  supplant you in that which your relationship to him and your devotedness to him
                  had given you an exclusive right to enjoy and inherit," she said, leaving the room
                  to make some programme for the afternoon.</p>
               <p>She was doubtless right in saying it was well for Mrs. Davenport she was not her
                  daughter in Lucy's stead; for she was too jealous of her rights and privileges to
                  tolerate a rival, and especially in Sarah, who had not been a generous rival to
                  her when four years' seniority was more to her advantage than it was considered
                  now.</p>
               <p>But Lucy had more to complain of than she acknowledged then.</p>
               <p>Since her mother's death she had been more like a companion than a child to her
                  father, reading to him, conversing with him, and nursing him, until there had been
                  an equality of mind established between them that entered into all their plans,
                  discussions, and agreements.</p>
               <p>Three years before, in one of those conversations which usually followed the
                  reading of a book, a compact was made between them that neither should get married
                  without the other's consent; and finally, that neither should get married while
                  the other lived, so that nothing could ever come between them. It was doubtless
                  proposed by Lucy in reply to some remarks her father had made on the biography she
                  had been reading; for it was a most unequal chance they were exchanging, as the
                  probability of any one marrying a bedridden old man was not great, while Lucy was
                  entering into her eighteenth year, with hope and life before her.</p>
               <p>It was afterwards alluded to as a standing agreement when any subject of
                  discussion called it to mind, and Lucy felt bound by it with the sincerity and
                  enthusiasm of youth. Her father's marriage seemed a violation of this compact, but
                  she did not then speak of it to any one.</p>
               <p>Rosamond returned soon, saying she had forgotten Robert when she thought of the
                  picnic, and asked if croquet instead would be agreeable to the party, as she could
                  place a chair on the ground for Robert to rest on while waiting for his turn to
                  play.</p>
               <p>When all had agreed, she enthusiastically said,—</p>
               <p>"I like to play croquet so <emph>very</emph> much because one can have partners in
                  it, and that destroys the selfishness of the battle. Though you knock your
                  adversaries away, and disarrange their positions, yet it is because you have some
                  one else besides yourself to consider. You have your partner to get into position
                  and put through an arch, just as you would help a friend through the straits, or
                  to the honors of life; and, however much superior as a player, and able to go
                  ahead to the stake yourself, you cannot win by deserting your partner, and leaving
                  him behind to his adversaries."</p>
               <pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC6133-00000079"/>
               <p>"In that case you had better take me for a partner, Miss Rosy; for you will have
                  opportunity to your heart's content of knocking me into position and through the
                  arches, as I am a miserable player; and you will in that way exercise those
                  generous qualities which I know you have, to make life happy, useful, and
                  successful," I said, forgetting for the moment that Lucy was my prospective
                  partner, and that Robert with his crutch, and solitaire pearl in his vest-pocket,
                  was most entitled to Rosamond's assistance.</p>
               <p>Her face brightened up, just as I saw it on one occasion before when I had paid
                  her a similar compliment; and selecting her favorite colored ball and mallet,
                  which was the blue, she exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"You shall be my partner, then, for you are the only one that has ever given me
                  credit for having any good qualities!"</p>
               <p>She stood by me faithfully through victory and defeat, playing back to me whenever
                  she had passed through an arch, and side by side we went out or were left behind
                  in each game, our balls never more than one arch apart.</p>
               <p>Late in the afternoon, while she and Robert were disputing whether a rover had or
                  had not a right to a ball each time he played, whether it had made an arch since
                  he played on it last or not, a carriage drove in between the mulberry-trees, and
                  we all turned to view it; for except Dr. Boynton's yellow-striped gig no other
                  strange vehicle had been driven in there that summer.</p>
               <p>Soon Lucy exclaimed it was her father, who had been doubtless taken sick, and was
                  compelled to return; and she ran down the avenue to meet him, forgetful of the
                  enstrangement that had kept him from "scarcely speaking to her for a month," as
                  Rosamond had said.</p>
               <p>The croquet-party was broken up, and Rosamond had now "positions" and "arches" to
                  assist Lucy through and maintain against her wily adversary.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <p>MR. DAVENPORT had not proceeded more than a day's journey with his "young and
                  accomplished bride" when their "tour" was terminated as Lucy had predicted; and
                  after remaining a few days at a hotel, they returned to the farm.</p>
               <p>As his wife's love for him was not of that quality which the poet describes,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'A love devoid of guile and sin,</l>
                        <l>A love forever kind and pure,</l>
                        <l>A love to suffer and endure,—</l>
                        <l>Unalterably firm and great,</l>
                        <l>Amid the angry storms of fate,—</l>

                     </lg>
                  </q> her mortification at being compelled to forego their trip, and, ere the first
                  week of her married life was passed, come back and settle down to the work she had
                  hired herself to do, was great indeed.</p>
               <p>Though a bridal tour is a powerful inducement to most maids, yet it may be asked
                  what pleasure or pride could a girl of Sarah's caliber take in going about with a
                  sick old man, to be laughed to scorn by all who saw them, and criticised for
                  having sold herself, wherever she went.</p>
               <p>But, my dear reader, many a young wife of an old man has enjoyed herself while
                  playing the "bear-leader" during her honeymoon, and afterwards, by simply thinking
                  that every young beau she met thought she was the old man's daughter, and
                  therefore eligible to his admiration.</p>
               <p>Sarah was denied even this brief pleasure, and had no more opportunities to look
                  forward to; for of all the sales of youth and beauty made to Mammon, she had made
                  the most unprofitable one.</p>
               <p>This was not the dream her youthful mind had hoped to realize when she was
                  seventeen or eighteen, and it was not the position and pride she had hoped to
                  obtain by her marriage when she was surrounded by a dozen of gallants, each
                  competing with the others for her brightest glances.</p>
               <p>But if she was ever romantic enough to have dreams, they were over now; and who
                  can say, when looking back and comparing the promises Hope had made to their youth
                  with the poor returns Life afterwards yielded, that themselves were not to blame
                  for departing from the truth and purity which inspired hope, and gave the future a
                  rose-color atmosphere? No one, I think; for the youthful heart, in beating high
                  with hopes of future success and greatness, never thinks of fraud and deceit as
                  the means of attaining these: truth, honor, and merit only are associated in the
                  mind with the realization of glory and happiness.</p>
               <p>The moment Lucy met them she threw herself into her father's arms, and at first
                  her tender embraces were returned; but, recollecting the unfilial desertion she
                  had contemplated, he checked himself<pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC6133-00000081"/>
                  self, and requested that she would not annoy him with demonstrations of affection,
                  which had already been too burdensome to her.</p>
               <p>"My affection too burdensome to me, father?" she cried, but was interrupted by
                  Mrs. Davenport, who gently took her hand and led her away, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Lucy, my love, his temper is ruffled by pain and fatigue, and you must not feel
                  hurt at his words. He has made me almost jealous by his frequent and tender
                  mention of you while we were away, and you should for that reason be able to
                  overlook a hasty expression now."</p>
               <p>"Yes, but what does he mean by an expression like that? He would not have uttered
                  it, even through irritation, if it had not been in his mind ready to be charged
                  against me," she said, looking with suspicion on her stepmother.</p>
               <p>"Nothing, dear,—he means nothing at all; he did not know the meaning of his words,
                  and very likely he forgets them already," was her affectionate and conciliating
                  reply, for she had no enmity toward Lucy; but now when her object was secured, was
                  quite willing that Mr. Davenport's affection should be shared both by herself and
                  her daughter-in-law, in order that the nursing could be divided also, for it was
                  not much to her taste. Lucy tried to think she was right in saying the words were
                  hastily spoken and as quickly forgotten; but Rosamond had awakened suspicion in
                  her unsuspecting breast, and though this was the first time her father had said
                  anything to betray the cause of his alienation, she could not help thinking it was
                  due to Sarah's undermining and misrepresentations. She looked earnestly at her,
                  therefore, and said, with pathos doubly impressive by her own innocence,—</p>
               <p>"Sarah, why has my father become so changed towards me since you came here, and
                  tell me what was his object in marrying you?"</p>
               <p>"Well, what a hard question you ask me, child!" she said, looking a surprise she
                  could scarcely have felt. "Old men have often before to-day taken a notion to
                  marrying young wives, and nobody has attempted to explain, or asked them to
                  explain so hard a metaphysical problem; but I suspect it was to get me to help you
                  to nurse him,—not a very flattering thought, but it is given to you in true
                  affection and confidence.</p>
               <p>"For my own motives in marrying I could account more confidently, but, as they
                  were scarcely more romantic, it is better to be silent with regard to them. But
                  you are surely mistaken in thinking that he has changed through my influence or
                  agency; and is it not your jealousy that makes you imagine it? You know it is
                  called the 'green-eyed monster,' and it has made you so sensitive that you wrong
                  him with suspicion whenever his pain makes him a little impatient or
                  neglectful."</p>
               <p>She touched the right chord; for Lucy could submit to suspicion or wrong herself
                  rather than wrong or suspect another, as, in the first case, she<pb n="162-163"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000082"/> would have the consolation of knowing herself to be
                  innocent; but, in the other, there were doubts of her own justice and
                  generosity.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, if I have wronged you, Sarah," she said, laying a hand on her
                  shoulder, and calling her again by the name she had used in happier times. "Some
                  one is mistaken, and I hope and trust it is I. I wish I had the courage to go to
                  him and speak plainly on the subject, as I do to you, for I cannot endure this
                  suspense much longer."</p>
               <p>"If you <emph>had,</emph> you would both grieve and surprise him, Lucy; for if you
                  will analyze your feelings, you will find that it is 'not that he loves you less,
                  but that he loves me more,' you are really complaining of; and, as his wife, I
                  think I have a right to more love than when I visited you as your cousin," she
                  said, with a look of gentle reproach.</p>
               <p>Skillfully as the words of the doughty Roman were adapted, they were suggestive of
                  crime and treachery to Lucy's mind; and, resuming her look of suspicion and
                  reserve, she said,—</p>
               <p>"Excuse my petulance and candor, Mrs. Davenport." And then withdrew from the
                  room.</p>
               <p>Sarah's meek eyes followed her, with the faintest smile breaking the serenity of
                  her red, gentle lips,—a smile of triumph or derision, it might have been, for
                  aught it expressed; for, ambiguous even in her smiles, her face, yet plump and
                  fair, concealed thoughts as well as its muscles, under its calm, smooth
                  surface.</p>
               <p>She returned to her husband, who was resting on a lounge, and said, in a
                  compassionate way, that Lucy had been hurt by being repulsed, and he replied,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, I fear I have been too harsh with her; I have not been considerate enough of
                  her feelings; and, unaccustomed to unkindness from me, it may goad her to an
                  extremity I would be guilty of equally with herself."</p>
               <p>"Yes, I think it would be better to say nothing to wound her, or betray a
                  knowledge or disapprobation of her designs," his spouse dutifully assented.</p>
               <p>It was painful and humiliating to the father to hear even his wife speak of his
                  daughter in connection with reprehensible and dark designs, and he groaned
                  out,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, that a child so pure in heart should fall into the temptation of having
                     <emph>thoughts even</emph> that I dare not confess to all the world with pride,
                  but rather must appear ignorant of them lest I should only hasten their transition
                  into actions!"</p>
               <p>No reply was made, for Robert entered, limping with the aid of his crutch, and was
                  followed by Rosamond, who had remained back to bid me a good-by, as I returned to
                  the railway station in the vehicle which brought Mr. and Mrs. Davenport from it;
                  and was excused in my hasty retreat by her, for saying that frankness and truth
                  could not let me make any professions suitable to the occasion.</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC6133-00000083"/>
               <p>There was a defiant civility in the greeting of the cousins, which was more in
                  accordance with their feelings than their words; for Sarah was aware of being
                  repugnant to Rosamond, and, true to human nature, she felt more disposed to defy
                  than to conciliate her, however she felt towards the others.</p>
               <p>And though drafted into that class termed "old women" by her marriage, and
                  therefore no longer a rival, according to Rosamond's thinking, yet she had
                  offended first by coming into the family, and next by marrying at all, since
                  Rosamond had kindly prophesied an old maid's life for her, and felt injured
                  because her prophecy came to naught.</p>
               <p>These feelings were characteristic of the wayward girl, vindictive to those who
                  crossed her, disliking with or without a cause, and devoted and partial to those
                  whom she looked upon as her friends or was interested in.</p>
               <p>She turned to Mr. Davenport and asked him where Lucy was, while Robert was
                  expressing his sympathy in his blandest tones with the bride, because she had been
                  compelled to return so soon instead of continuing her travels.</p>
               <p>"She has gone to her room, I believe, Rosy, and I wish you would find her, and say
                  to her that if I have spoken unkindly she must forgive me; our life is too short
                  and uncertain to be embittered by unkindness," Mr. Davenport replied, sadly.</p>
               <p>Here was an opportunity for Rosamond to serve friend and foe, according to her
                  desire, and she improved it by saying,—</p>
               <p>"Lucy has suffered much lately, uncle, because she imagined your feelings were
                  changed towards her, and your manner cold and harsh without any known cause; and
                  though she has not made me her messenger in the matter, I take the liberty, for
                  which affection for you both must be excuse, of mentioning it to you. If she is
                  not in error in regard to your feelings there is a great misunderstanding
                  somewhere, and I trust you will authorize me to say to her that it is with herself
                  the trouble and error exist."</p>
               <p>She bent over him, and ended her speech with a few kisses, like one accustomed to
                  carry her point by some means.</p>
               <p>"Go, my child, and do as I first requested you; she may be guilty of a <emph>great
                     mistake,</emph> but I can never wish my daughter less than I have ever since
                  the hour I first saw her," he said, with stubborn dignity and an air of offended
                  authority, which gave the words an unsatisfactory import to the intercessor.</p>
               <p>"Then I must convey your words only to her, uncle, if I would bring her
                  consolation, for you speak them as if extending rather than asking forgiveness,"
                  was her bold reply; and seeing that her words were not taken unkindly, she
                  added,—</p>
               <p>"As you say, there is a <emph>great mistake</emph> somewhere; but since she does
                  not mistake your feelings towards her, it lies farther back; for she could not
                     be<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC6133-00000084"/> guilty of a thought, word, or act
                  that would merit your displeasure or need your forgiveness." She spoke with
                  pathetic earnestness, and her speech seemed pregnant with meaning to the deluded
                  father; but the step which completed the alienation had been taken, and when it
                  was too late to retreat, he closed his heart against convictions.</p>
               <p>The winning and solicitous expression which accompanied her words was changed for
                  a wicked and contemptuous one the moment Rosamond left the room, and she stamped
                  upon the matting in the hall as she denounced the male portion of humanity as born
                  to be dupes, and worthy only of contempt for their simplicity.</p>
               <p>"Well, what is the use of trying to set people right when they will be wrong? He
                  is an old dotard, and if Sarah can get any good out of him I do not blame her much
                  for using him. The prefix mistress has an air of respectability about it, even if
                  a woman gets it by fraud. People do not inquire by what means a woman became some
                  old fool's wife, but how much she has got by it. And then 'Somebody's Wife' looks
                  so proper on a tombstone; the sentimental reader will associate more charms in his
                  mind with it than if it had been 'Somebody's Daughter' and she had been as
                  beautiful as an houri," was her charitable soliloquy as she went slowly
                  up-stairs.</p>
               <p>She pushed the door of Lucy's chamber open and stepped lightly into it, where she
                  saw the poor girl kneeling against her bed with her face buried in it.</p>
               <p>"She will be more calm when she gets up," Rosamond solemnly thought, as she softly
                  stole to a seat and picked up a book, for she respected in Lucy many sentiments
                  and traits of character she did not understand.</p>
               <p>When anything troubled her own mind, she either tried to banish it from her
                  thoughts, or fostered it with the strength and intensity of her feelings; but she
                  nevertheless believed that Lucy had a better way, though without any pretense or
                  desire to be partaker in it. Lucy's piety and practice had Rosamond's fullest
                  respect and approval, and she turned her eyes away from witnessing the scene
                  before her, rather because she knew Lucy would not wish to be seen than that it
                  was distasteful to herself.</p>
               <p>She read nearly an hour before Lucy looked up, and then, seeing her slightly
                  confused upon finding that she had not been alone, Rosamond said,
                  apologetically,—</p>
               <p>"I have not been here long, Lucy. I came to find you at your father's request, and
                  to say to you that he is sorry for his hasty speech when he spoke to you
                  down-stairs."</p>
               <p>Lucy's face blushed brightly, and she cried,—</p>
               <p>"Has he said so? What were his words, Rosy? Please tell me! Tell me all he
                  said!"</p>
               <p>"He merely said that he was sorry for his rough way of expressing his affection,
                  in these words," said the candid girl, repeating the precise words and tone for
                  Lucy's benefit.</p>
               <pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC6133-00000085"/>
               <p>"There is not much consolation in that, as I had nothing to forgive; it is no
                  crime to express his feelings; and, since the feelings are still there, I am no
                  better off by his sorrow for having betrayed them," she replied.</p>
               <p>Rosamond was not a good comforter, being resentful and independent; and she
                  replied,—</p>
               <p>"Why, certainly the feelings are there, or else he would not have them to betray.
                  Have I not told you that several times before to-day? and, what is worse still,
                  Sarah Carroll has put them there by some sleight-of-hand, or how would she become
                  his wife and mistress of the house otherwise? Take my advice, Lucy, and ask your
                  father in such a decided manner that he cannot refuse to listen, why he has
                  thought it necessary to get married; premising your speech by telling him that you
                  wish to say something that may not be agreeable to him to listen to, but which,
                  nevertheless, cannot be left unsaid. That will rivet his attention, and keep him
                  from silencing you by a plea of indisposition; and my word for it, he will tell
                  you, for he is not fool enough to talk of love at his age. If he refuses, insist,
                  and tell him that unless you know the cause of his injustice to you, and see it
                  remedied right speedily, you will not live under his roof."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Rosy, you are too violent! How could I address such words to my father, or
                  dictate so arrogantly to him? You could not urge such a course if you had a father
                  to love and respect. Besides, you seem to forget that my father <emph>has not
                     wronged me by marrying;</emph> it is only an unjust suspicion of my love for
                  him I can complain of, and treating him as you advise would only justify those
                  same suspicions."</p>
               <p>"Well, it is all the same; his suspicions of your love and his marriage with Sarah
                  are hand-in-glove with each other,—the one is a sequence of the other; and it does
                  not signify which term you use to begin with. Call it suspicion, if you please,
                  and ask him what suspicions induced him to marry a 'Becky Sharp,' scarcely older
                  than yourself; for that is the point to which his suspicions have drifted
                  him."</p>
               <p>Lucy was too well convinced that his marriage was the result of some intrigue of
                  Sarah's to reply to her argument, and she mildly said,—</p>
               <p>"Well, it is done now, and complaining of it will make no one happier. I will try
                  to be the same to him that I was always; and, Cousin Sarah being no more, my
                  father's wife is entitled to my respect and assistance; so let us drop the
                  subject, Rosy dear, it only makes me feel wretched and rebellious to brood over
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Certainly, dear, if you wish; it is only for you I am concerned: for your
                  father's wife, though a new creature, was an acquaintance of mine in a
                  pre-existent stated, and I think she will not attempt to assume a dictatorship
                  over me. No one but a man shall do that, and when he comes into power<pb
                     n="170-171" xml:id="VAC6133-00000086"/> I hope he will make me walk a straight
                  line, or mark my steps with my blood!"</p>
               <p>"You do?" exclaimed Lucy, diverted from her own cares by the strength and
                  strangeness of her cousin's hopes.</p>
               <p>"I certainly do; for I do not think I would be good and obedient of my own accord,
                  and I want a husband who will be severe on my foibles, and terrify me into duty
                  and obedience with a rod of iron."</p>
               <p>"Well, you desire a very odd qualification in a husband. I should think, where a
                  woman was anxious to be dutiful and decorous, she would find love and example
                  greater incentives than cruelty and terror." Lucy said, now quite interested in
                  her cousin's ideal.</p>
               <p>"I would not; love and tenderness would only make me contrary and aggravating;
                  like the sugarcane, I must be crushed to get the sweetness out of me. The first
                  man that asks me shall have me now, if he has iron enough in his blood to make me
                  quail and quiver when he looks at me," she said, with her usual exaggeration.</p>
               <p>"You have been doing very well since you came back to us, and yet we have not
                  ruled you with an iron rod. You get on very nicely with Robert, and he is not an
                  iron-mill to crush you," said Lucy, with a roguish look.</p>
               <p>"No, you are all too good for me, and that is why I am spoiling here instead of
                  getting better, as I had hoped good associations would make me. I am daily in fear
                  of an eruption, for I feel some powerful and malignant element within me boiling
                  and struggling for vent."</p>
               <p>"That is what the oldest girls used to say in Miss French's school when we went
                  there," Lucy said, laughing merrily.</p>
               <p>"Yes, but those precocious chits meant hearts, while I mean something more of the
                  nature of old Lucifer,—nitre, bitumen, and brimstone, I suppose, or something else
                  that has an infernal element in it."</p>
               <p>Lucy made no reply, having no knowledge of the elements and impulses her cousin
                  confessed to; and, after a pause, Rosamond looked cautiously towards the door and
                  windows, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Luce, what do you think of Robert and I being engaged to each other?"</p>
               <p>"I think it is very natural that you should be; in fact, I know it must be so, you
                  are so much together, and your fondness for each other is so apparent," was the
                  candid reply.</p>
               <p>"Oh, did you know it? Well, then, you allowed yourself to fall into an error, for
                  we are not engaged," she cried, piqued that Lucy should seem to be aware of that
                  which she would not acknowledge to either Robert or her own heart.</p>
               <p>"Oh, well, I am easily corrected, then. It is because you asked what I would think
                  of it that I anticipated it, for I would gladly congratulate you upon such a happy
                  event."</p>
               <p>This generous reply had a communicative effect upon Rosamond; and she
                  continued,—</p>
               <pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC6133-00000087"/>
               <p>"Well, there is a sort of an engagement, an understanding, I suppose; for it is
                  not binding upon either, but can be laughed off the moment either of us becomes
                  tired of the other."</p>
               <p>"That is convenient enough for the most fickle; but I do not think you will want
                  to laugh it off, as you ought not to get tired of Robert, and I know he will not
                  of you."</p>
               <p>"Pshaw! he will be the first to get tired of it; one man is as good as another,
                  and one woman is a great deal better than another, so I do not expect anything
                  more than a short flirtation to come of it," she said, lightly.</p>
               <p>Lucy looked earnestly at her for a few moments, and, either angry at her for
                  making so light of it, or else understanding her disposition, she said, with some
                  energy,—</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I hope nothing more than a flirtation will come of it! Robert
                  deserves a woman's whole love, and will be sure to get it if there are any
                  true-hearted and deep enough to appreciate him!"</p>
               <p>This reproof aroused some jealousy in her heart; for when such an assertion is
                  made between women, the understanding is that the speaker considers herself the
                  person who could and would appreciate so much; and, though Rosamond had
                  acknowledged that Robert was free, she was not willing that he should make use of
                  his freedom just then. She therefore said, in a petulant tone,—</p>
               <p>"Why, Luce, if he heard you, he would propose on the spot, without giving you time
                  to move off the square of the carpet you stand on, or letting me leave the room,
                  though he knows I am no snail in my movements."</p>
               <p>"I do not think he would be so rash in a serious matter, or that the engagement,
                  understanding, or whatever term you choose to designate it by, rests as lightly on
                  his shoulders as it seems to rest upon yours."</p>
               <p>"Well, suppose it does not? Can a woman who sits at home waiting for proposals to
                  come to her be expected to know her own mind and value as well as a man who is in
                  the market making the proposals, and establishing the price of such wares? I would
                  be more cautious than that if only selling a fine cow; and when it is myself I
                  want to dispose of, I ought to be anxious to make a good sale. Would it not be
                  foolish of a woman to accept or reject a bid unconditionally before she knew
                  whether she was offered enough or not?" she asked.</p>
               <p>"Rosy, you are heartless! If I was a man I would feel it my duty both to yourself
                  and to Robert to caution him against one who would enter into a holy state
                  governed by the views of a cattle-dealer," she cried.</p>
               <p>"You could not tell him more than he is already aware of; for why should not
                  common sense be applied to the matrimonial as well as the cattle trade? He may
                  look farther and see one that he likes better, and so may I; and then it will be
                  well to know that we have no contracts to bind or break;<pb n="174-175"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000088"/> and, if we should still remain satisfied with each
                  other, we can feel more assured of our contentment by remembering that we were
                  free at any time to make other disposal of our hearts and hands if we had been so
                  minded," she replied, with some animation.</p>
               <p>"It may be fair and prudent in business to do as you say, Rosy; but you are not so
                  utterly insensible to the happiness or misery of thirty or forty years of wedded
                  life to enter into it with so little real love: a curse would follow you all your
                  days, and you could never look back without feeling that it had been merited."</p>
               <p>"Well, thank you, cousin, for your defense of me against myself. I am not utterly
                  heartless, I hope; but you know we are privileged to say worse things of ourselves
                  than we would like others to say; and, since you were bold enough to rebuke me, I
                  take it all back. <emph>No bids considered by Miss Rosy Heywood unless they look
                     to a fair exchange of heart for heart, and refusals to be final, whether she
                     gets a second offer or not.</emph> Hear that, gentlemen, and all others whom it
                  may concern, and give attention, that you may understand! <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >Au revoir. Luce, ma chère!</foreign> Our engagement may come to something
                  yet!" And she danced out of the room with a dozen curtsies.</p>
               <p>There was a want of feeling and sincerity in her manner that gave Lucy pain, and
                  when she found herself alone again she locked the door to prevent another
                  surprise. The tears flowed as freely and silently as before; the sorrow caused by
                  her father's words was, for awhile, forgotten, and a fresh grief had been aroused
                  by the very person who had come to soothe the former one.</p>
               <p>If Robert had been her brother, or if, as she had said, she were a man, she might
                  feel it her duty to caution him, and could do so without fear of being
                  misunderstood; but, though she did not fear that from Robert's modest and generous
                  mind, her maidenly feelings shrank from so delicate a task.</p>
               <p>Rosamond had received the stimulus to constancy that she wished for, but not in
                  the way she had expected. Sisterly love, such as Lucy entertained for Robert, she
                  could not feel towards any young man eligible to matrimony, so long as her own
                  hopes were not secure on that important matter; and she could not credit or
                  appreciate such a feeling in Lucy. Had she seen the tears Lucy was now shedding
                  over her <emph>heartless</emph> theory,—of the interchange of hearts,—she would
                  have ascribed them to selfish feelings; but she fancied she had seen enough to
                  give her an insight of Lucy's heart, and she determined to tighten her hold of
                  Robert, if only for the piquancy of rivalry. After the novelty of her ambiguous
                  engagement had worn out, it seemed too tame and commonplace for her energetic and
                  sanguine temperament, and she spent hours debating the question of her engagement
                  by counting the buttons on her wrapper, and saying, "I am engaged; I am not,"
                  after the manner of schoolboys<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC6133-00000089"/> boys,
                  when determining their future standing in society, by saying, "Rich man, poor man,
                  beggar man, thief," as they finger the buttons on their jackets. Now she was
                  certain that she was engaged to Robert; Lucy had helped to convince her of it, and
                  she was glad Lucy knew it.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>ROBERT had scarcely recovered strength to walk without a cane before he became
                  tired of the country life which had promised him so much pleasure. Perhaps his
                  confinement had much to do with his discontent, for people like to rush from one
                  extreme to another; and now, when he could walk again, painting and sketching
                  became too inactive for him, or had too little of the excitement he craved
                  for.</p>
               <p>Several interviews had taken place between us, in which the policy of leaving his
                  easel for awhile, and entering into mercantile pursuits, was debated. The motive
                  was very apparent to me,—he was impatient of waiting to become rich by his pencil,
                  and had read in books, dealing more in fiction than in fact, that fortunes were
                  often made by a "stroke of the pen."</p>
               <p>Avarice was not one of his sins, or the cause of his discontent. The single-minded
                  bachelor Paul has said, "He that is married careth for the things of this world
                  how he may please his wife;" and in that saying was the key to Robert's
                  worldliness.</p>
               <p>He felt married in spirit, and in want of much of this world's goods to please a
                  worldly wife; for the few words he had said to Rosamond while ascending<pb
                     n="178-179" xml:id="VAC6133-00000090"/> cending the hill that day had wholly
                  changed his wants, his wishes, and his world. He felt now that there was a time,
                  and an event, "a consummation most devoutly to be wished for" by himself, and due
                  to the girl who had promised to wait for him, and that his great duty was to
                  eschew anything that would delay it, and embrace every opportunity of hastening
                  it.</p>
               <p>Though I admired his talent, and envied the quite life he led with it, I did not
                  discourage the change he contemplated; for I knew he was prompted by a desire to
                  fulfill his engagement with Rosamond; and the effort would gain him experience,
                  and tend to make him contented with his professional earnings, if it failed to
                  benefit him in aught else.</p>
               <p>After the preliminaries of his new career had been settled, he told Rosamond that
                  he intended to lay his designs on canvas aside for awhile and turn merchant,
                  expecting she would appreciate the sacrifice and say something in commendation of
                  the profession which was dear to him. But Rosamond did not seem to think that
                  herself was at all connected with the change, and had no sympathy to offer, as she
                  thought it was the result of a change in his taste, and a love of adventure.</p>
               <p>In fact, she rejoiced to hear of his better prospects; for mercantile enterprise
                  was associated with success in her ardent mind. His romantic profession too tame
                  for Robert, she thought, and not half so attractive to herself as speculation and
                  traffic. Robert felt hurt because she so lightly esteemed the artist, and would
                  have him exchange art for trade, so he said,—</p>
               <p>"I am going away down to Peru, Rosy; and it may be a long time before we see each
                  other again: when we do, I hope to be so independent that I can pursue painting,
                  and leave mercantile enterprise to those who are better fitted for it. When I told
                  Ned that I loaned my spare money to a merchant of my acquaintance at six percent.,
                  and even thought myself accommodated by him in taking it from me, he laughed at
                  me, and said the merchant doubtless made fifty percent. out of it each year, and
                  showed me a way that he thinks I can double it in yearly, besides seeing much in
                  my travels that will benefit me in after-life."</p>
               <p>"Going away down to Peru," where earthquakes, tidal waves, and fevers would
                  endanger his life, and dark-eyed houries endanger his heart, did not appall
                  Rosamond, or even seem to check her mercantile enthusiasm for a moment; bartering,
                  buying and selling, and getting gain were the only advantages she thought of
                  then.</p>
               <p>"Oh, if I were a man I should like to do that, above all things! Trading among
                  men, and making a handsome profit every time, would suit my speculative
                  disposition exactly. I would go, too, and be in partnership with you, if you would
                  not object to the style of Robert Heberton &amp; Co., and we would divide our
                  profits every year, and say 'fifty thousand apiece' to each other."</p>
               <p>If she was not enthusiastic for his genius as a<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000091"/> painter, she would be at least for his success as a
                  merchant, he thought, and his good humor was restored again by the happy conceit
                  of the partnership; for it was the very end he was exerting himself to bring
                  about, though in a different sense from that which she desired to be understood
                  in—a partnership of joys and sorrows.</p>
               <p>"We can go into partnership yet, anyhow,—men and women often do that, and are
                  sometimes more fortunate than two men would be," he said, with a significant
                  look.</p>
               <p>Rosamond did not see the look, or notice the ambiguity of his words, she was
                  thinking of capital, and she said,—</p>
               <p>"Are you in earnest? would it not be too much trouble for you to do that?"</p>
               <p>"Not at all; it would be the greatest pleasure of my life to enter into such a
                  partnership with you, Rosy dear, circumstances permitting," he said, thinking
                  still of marriage.</p>
               <p>"Would it, though? Well, then, I have two thousand dollars idle, and getting me
                  only four per cent, in the savings-bank, and you can put them with your money, and
                  we shall be partners, Robert."</p>
               <p>He was annoyed and mortified to learn that they were thinking of different
                  conditions, and his pride rebelled against taking some of her money with him,
                  though he was flattered by thinking that the generous girl divined his object, and
                  wished to insure success, and speed the time by increasing his capital. But his
                  independence would not admit of such an offer, however flattering the motive, and
                  he said, with affectionate earnestness,—</p>
               <p>"No, Rosy dear, I have all the capital I can, with my limited experience, safely
                  invest. Keep your two thousand dollars where they are; we can be in partnership
                  without them."</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, that would not be fair; I will not take a cent of your profits unless you
                  earn it with my money, and I should insist, only I fear it would be too much
                  trouble for you to bother with it. I have spent many an hour devising some plan
                  for making it yield me more profit, but I cannot think of any. Only about a dollar
                  and a half a week,—barely enough to keep some girls in gloves, and I would do
                  without it, if I could make a venture of it. You have no idea how speculative I
                  am, or how it would please me to invest and be a nabob," she said, with apologetic
                  frankness.</p>
               <p>"You are rights; I did not think you were troubled with financial schemes, and I
                  would willingly assist you if I was not afraid of making them worse, instead of
                  better, for you," he replied, displeased at finding her so mercenary, and disposed
                  to accommodate her for that reason.</p>
               <p>"I know there is risk in all ventures, but I am not afraid of that, if it will not
                  inconvenience you to invest for me when you are investing for yourself. I can get
                  the money for you in a day or two," she replied, her countenance brightening at
                  the prospect of increased revenues from it.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, we will be in partnership. I will<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000092"/> use all my money as the active capital, and yours
                  can remain where it is, in reserve, which will insure its safety," he said.</p>
               <p>"But could you not make so much more profit by using mine too, Robert?—its safety
                  is of little consequence, as I could do without the income it now yields if it
                  should be lost," she asked, some what discouraged at the idea of leaving her money
                  where it was.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps I could; but Ned will tell you that all the good firms in the city have
                  money secured outside of their active capital, and the firm of 'Heberton &amp;
                  Heywood' must not be behind them in that respect. If there should be profit, which
                  I hope there will, you will be entitled to your half; but your two thousand
                  dollars must be left secure, if you value my health; for the fear of losing them
                  would not let me eat or sleep," he returned.</p>
               <p>She laughed, and slightly colored, as if she was not insensible to his anxiety,
                  and said,—</p>
               <p>"But have you no regard for <emph>my</emph> health? I may not be able to eat or
                  sleep when I know that your money is at risk; and if you do not take my share and
                  use it, I will not take any of the profits from you. I would be a nice partner,
                  indeed, to share your profits but have no part in your losses!"</p>
               <p>"Well, I suppose I can safely promise to let you bear your part of the losses
                  also, for I do not see how there can be a loss. Ned has made out a list of those
                  articles which will pay best, and, not being staple products, they are mostly
                  overlooked by greater merchants, and pay double profits, without requiring much
                  capital. He is a partner, too, and will keep me posted on the markets, and watch
                  for my interest in the commission-houses, as he will not be known in the
                  transactions at all. He has arranged it so that I can invest our united capital as
                  often as I have opportunity, will let me know what to ship, and see that the
                  produce is held and sold at the right time, and then, when I come home, I can
                  divide with him."</p>
               <p>"Well, I declare, I am as proud as I am fortunate in having you for a friend; you
                  talk like a merchant-prince already, and I have no doubt that we shall make a
                  fortune between us. 'Pearson, Heberton &amp; Heywood!' Whew! Won't that be a heavy
                  signature 'on Change,' though?" she exclaimed, laughing until the tears ran down
                  her cheeks.</p>
               <p>Though there was nothing like his art to Robert's mind, and he resigned it now for
                  a season with regret, yet he felt pleased that Rosamond should think he had the
                  tact of adapting himself so readily to circumstances, and he said, with a
                  smile,—</p>
               <p>"I should have felt greatly hurt had I known before to-day that the artist was so
                  lightly esteemed; but now since you appreciate me so highly as a man of business,
                  and we are really partners, I must forgive you, and claim the privilege of writing
                  to you as often as I like. What kind of a firm would it be if there was not a
                  regular correspondence kept up between the home and foreign partners?"</p>
               <pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC6133-00000093"/>
               <p>"Oh, yes, write to me, Bob! You shall see what a clever business letter I can
                  write you,—'Your esteemed favor is at hand; markets firm, stock reduced,
                  quotations same as last, with more inquiry,' and so forth."</p>
               <p>This was a privilege Robert would have asked for, even without the partnership,
                  for he hoped a separation and an active correspondence would satisfy him more with
                  regard to his own feelings as well as hers; for he had too exalted an idea of the
                  holy passion to be contented with a mere warmth of feeling or interest; and he
                  hoped absence would not only try it by removing it from the hot-house of each
                  other's society, but also enable both to free themselves from the habit of airy
                  badinage, which kept in the background the more earnest and exalted expressions of
                  regard, and left him continually dissatisfied with both his feelings and his
                  speeches.</p>
               <p>He tried also to believe that Rosamond's love was deeper than her vivacity and
                  coquetry would sometimes indicate; and that, when he was no longer at her side,
                  her heart would speak to him, instead of making herself appear more mercenary and
                  anomalous than she really was, lest his regret, interest, and solicitude, no
                  longer being excited by her exaggeration, he would take her at her own estimation,
                  and think her unwomanly and fickle.</p>
               <p>"You must write me something more than the state of the markets, Rosy, or your
                  letters will be dull; for Ned can do that better than you can. You know that I
                  cannot forget old friends and old feelings merely by going a few thousand miles to
                  invest a few thousand dollars, so you must tell me all about the old house and the
                  family in which we both have been treated so kindly; but above all, you must speak
                  of yourself and your feelings: let us lay aside reserve and deal as truly with
                  each other as we hope God will deal with us in this and the next world. If we do
                  not deceive each other we will have nothing to accuse ourselves of, for we cannot
                  help our feelings; and it is only by feigning them that we have anything to fear
                  or can chide each other for," he said, his voice trembling with emotion.</p>
               <p>"I shall be afraid to say much about myself, you will see so much to condemn, for
                  you know how quick you are to discern faults, Robert," she said, awed into
                  seriousness by his solemn charge.</p>
               <p>"If I am, Rosy, let me say this much in extenuation: I discern faults only where
                  my warmest interest quickens my sight. Love does not blind me, but rather makes me
                  more watchful and solicitous, lest I should detect anything in those I love to
                  make them less perfect than I would wish to see them; and I am blind to faults and
                  follies only where I am too indifferent towards the owner to perceive them."</p>
               <p>"How horrible! What a wretched lover you would make! I hope to get a husband who
                  will be as blind as a bat, rather than he should see my faults, or see me grow old
                  and ugly, and despise<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC6133-00000094"/> me," she cried,
                  thrown back on her sprightly exaggeration by the compliment implied in his
                  speech.</p>
               <p>"That would be a misfortune, as he could not see what a charming bride he would
                  have to begin with; but I have eyes to see that, Rosy, while they would never
                  despise you for your imperfections, age, or decay. Man and woman grow old
                  together, and do not perceive it when they love; it is the mind that really makes
                  us young or aged, and with your cheerful disposition I would always think you were
                  but your twenty-one," he said, carried with her from seriousness to gallantry.</p>
               <p>A compliment was never lost on Rosamond, and while her face out on its warmest
                  glow, her eyes shot out a soft light that betrayed the intense satisfaction she
                  derived from his speech, made as it was in full view and recognition of their
                  implicit engagement.</p>
               <p>Her gaze was bent full on him for awhile, partly in doubt of the sincerity of his
                  words, and partly in bashful consciousness of their meaning, while he boldly met
                  it with eyes which said, "I have said it, and will make my word good."</p>
               <p>There are times when even fickle and unstable people can be firm and true, and if
                  fixed by a timely word, something they would regard as binding and absolute beyond
                  their own weak will, they may become martyrs for a principle or a sentiment.</p>
               <p>This time might have been Rosamond's now, and her affections, vacillating and
                  unsettled as they were, might have been unalterably bound had he said the right
                  word, something that would strip their engagement of its ambiguity and demand from
                  her the full measure and meaning of love, by the open confession of his own.</p>
               <p>The time was not, however, improved; for though his heart beat quickly as he read
                  in her face the keen pleasure his words had given her, he still preferred to leave
                  her free to wait for him, if her heart was strong enough, and if not, liberty to
                  accept any one she could love better. It must also be confessed that love made him
                  more sensible of her imperfections than he even confessed, for he really doubted
                  whether a positive engagement would be more binding on her than a partial one, if
                  she should be tempted by a more favored suitor during his absence; while a broken
                  troth would leave a more unpleasant feeling between them, should such a thing
                  happen.</p>
               <p>So Robert and Rosamond came no nearer to an explicit understanding by their
                  temporary partnership. They were equally shy of the engagement, though they
                  coquetted around it a good deal; for, distrustful of each other's feelings,
                  whenever they came to the brink of their Rubicon, instead of boldly crossing,
                  their timidity overcame them, and they called up other objects to cover a
                  precipitate retreat.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenport, his wife, and Lucy furnished them topics for feint demonstrations
                  against each other whenever the wily pair found themselves<pb n="188-189"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000095"/> forced on to the charge by each recurring allusion
                  to their copartnership and the probable results of it; and though the life
                  partnership of joys and sorrows was often in view, they as often exerted
                  themselves to recede from it, as if from a dangerous whirlpool.</p>
               <p>With fortune now almost within his grasp (for what young adventurer does not see
                  it in his investments?), Robert looked upon his marriage with Rosamond as an event
                  close at hand, and he blamed himself, after their interview was over, for not
                  making a clean breast of his affection, and a plain fact of their fallacious
                  engagement.</p>
               <p>Rosamond, on the contrary, was well satisfied with herself for her success in
                  evading the delicate point. Robert had committed himself by words and looks more
                  than she could accuse herself of doing, and she had the benefit of his open-faced
                  candor without any reciprocation.</p>
               <p>The great question was yet before her for decision, and she went on again in her
                  old way of debating it, still saying, with a taper finger on her buttons, "I am
                  engaged; I am not!"</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>AS the day of his departure approached, Robert lost much of his self-confidence,
                  and would have sold out his expectations at much less than their par value, I
                  think; not that he was less anxious for the trial, but he was more solicitous as
                  to the result of it.</p>
               <p>He was leaving his art, which had, at least, afforded him a competency since he
                  had become its master, and was venturing what he had saved in a forlorn-hope, so
                  far as his experience was concerned.</p>
               <p>But though Rosamond was the only one of the family who knew aught of his designs,
                  yet she had kept him up to them by frequent mention of their pecuniary prospects,
                  while he was making silent preparation for the voyage. She showed so much desire
                  to realize more than the eighty dollars per annum, he began to fear that he was
                  important only as he was useful to her, and he therefore felt annoyed at the
                  enthusiasm which had recently encouraged him.</p>
               <p>He was morbidly thinking that his death might even be hailed with joy by her could
                  he promise to aid her in the spirit-land, when it suddenly occurred to him that
                  Rosamond was acting the speculator,<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC6133-00000096"/> and
                  talking of gain to hide her real feelings. It seemed hardly possible that she
                  could place one who had always been so friendly and companionable to her in a
                  balance with the profit on two thousand dollars, and it would not be unlike her to
                  hide her interest in his success, and the event which would follow it, by talking
                  of the pecuniary results.</p>
               <p>Full of new hopes, he went to Mr. Davenport, and told him that he was about to try
                  a mercantile career for awhile, and would, in a few days, sail for South America
                  under very encouraging auspices.</p>
               <p>There is something in the adventure and supposed wealth of the merchant that
                  dazzles even genius. The poet, the painter, the statesman, the soldier, and the
                  minister of the gospel appear to bow alike before the great golden calf, and have
                  done so ever since the time Moses was up in the mount. His wealth and magnificence
                  has dazzled even the children of the sun, and the old tales of the East have them
                  for their heroes.</p>
               <p>Antar has no doubt played the sycophant in their Arabian palaces as much as
                  "Sindbad the Sailor" does in the "Arabian Nights," and the wild asses of the
                  desert have brayed in echo as the rich caravans crossed the plains from Damascus
                  to Bag-dad.</p>
               <p>To be a "merchant-prince," and have ships on every sea, is of such great
                  importance that the preacher of the riches of the kingdom of heaven must stop in
                  his sermon to explain that such was the case with some man with whom he had
                  conversed; and, not having yet seen the inside of a counting-house, some boyish
                  heart would leap higher and beat faster with commercial emulation than when the
                  preacher spoke, with less earnest reality, of the golden streets and pearly gates
                  of the New Jerusalem.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenport, artist, philosopher, and invalid though he was, was not exempt from
                  this weakness, and he at once dilated upon the great and beneficial results of
                  commercial enterprise. "Worlds have been discovered, civilization has been
                  advanced, and nations have been sustained by it; the winds and the waves have been
                  trained and made to serve it, and it is the patron of the arts and the sciences,"
                  was the laudatory sentence that followed Robert's communication; but he forgot to
                  add to his glowing picture, the butcheries and miseries which its avarice and
                  rapacity have carried to Mexico, Peru, India, and China. The poor man forgot for
                  awhile, in his enthusiasm for his new career, how much he leaned upon Robert. Cut
                  off from fellowship with his fellow-men, he felt Robert's conversation the only
                  relief he had from the monotony of female society, and he would long ago have
                  forgotten that he was a man himself, but that Robert had brought him such views
                  and thoughts from the world of men as served to recuperate his manhood.</p>
               <p>Sarah was present at the interview, and if she had ever been sincere before in her
                  life she was so<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC6133-00000097"/> when she commended
                  Robert's enterprise and ambition. Leaving out the fact that her father had been a
                  merchant, and she appreciated the profits of the trade, she could also be sincere
                  because Robert was more in Mr. Davenport's confidence than she was, and whenever
                  she could be dispensed with as a nurse, he turned to him for advice and
                  companionship.</p>
               <p>Both wife and daughter could not have been true to him, and knowing himself to be
                  hastening to the grave, and fearing he might close a virtuous and useful life by
                  an injustice to either, he made Robert his counselor.</p>
               <p>Sarah had good reason to fear that her wages might be withheld by Robert's
                  influence, and therefore was glad that he was going away.</p>
               <p>As soon as she left them alone for a few moments, her husband said to Robert,—</p>
               <p>"My time is rapidly approaching its end, my dear boy; for I am old beyond my
                  years. With Jacob, I can say that 'the days of the years of my life have been few
                  and evil, and I have not yet attained unto the days of the years of my fathers in
                  their pilgrimage; but I have been long since laid aside as useless in this active
                  world, and maybe before you have entered your new career I shall have begun a new
                  and better life."</p>
               <p>Robert replied that he hoped to find him alive and in better health on his
                  return.</p>
               <p>But the old artist hopelessly observed,—</p>
               <p>"No, Robert, hope will not save me, and it will deceive <emph>you</emph> if you
                  believe in it. My day is over, and why should I wish to prolong the night of my
                  life? I have even lived too long; for had I died a year ago I could have left my
                  orphan girl to the providence of God as one of His own angels; but now I can only
                  commit her to His mercy and compassion."</p>
               <p>"I hope you will not die so soon, sir; but more than all, God forbid that you
                  should die with unjust suspicions of Lucy's duty towards you, whatever your wife
                  may have said."</p>
               <p>"I have told you all that I know about it, and I do not see why we both should
                  draw different conclusions from the same evidence," he said, thinking from
                  Robert's earnest manner that he had more reliable information.</p>
               <p>"But I have not told you all that I know about it, for I cannot now; but I can say
                  this much, sir, no one could retain my friendship for one moment after having
                  abused your hospitality, as you suspect Mr. Pearson of doing, and yet I am as much
                  his friend now as I ever was; and no one would more strongly condemn Lucy's
                  ingratitude and folly in purposing to desert the best and most indulgent of
                  fathers; and yet I now tell you, as perhaps it may be my last opportunity of
                  speaking to you, that I believe she is the truest friend you have; and I shall
                  always love and respect her as the worthy child of my best of all earthly
                  friends."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, his earnestness brought tears into the artist's eyes, whether for joy
                  that there was<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC6133-00000098"/> one to believe in his
                  daughter's filial care, or sorrow that he had wronged her by ever doubting its
                  constancy.</p>
               <p>After pausing a moment, he held out his hand to Robert, and said,—</p>
               <p>"God be with and prosper you, my dear boy, though there is none of my blood in
                  your veins. You have always been my pleasure and my pride; and, as you still
                  believe Lucy to be what I have found her for twenty years, be always a brother and
                  a friend to her, and God will bless you for it. Her friends and companions are
                  limited to Rosy Heywood and yourself: and even if she <emph>had</emph>
                  contemplated leaving me, I am mostly to blame; for I have denied her the society
                  and pleasures her age craves, and selfishly kept her at my side to nurse and
                  comfort me; and now, when I shall go the way of all the earth, she will have but
                  few friends or acquaintances in the world in consequence of her seclusion."</p>
               <p>I have not yet explained how Robert came to be Mr. Davenport's ward; but there
                  could be no time so fitting for it as now, when he is about to leave him and the
                  art he learned from him for a distant clime and a new calling.</p>
               <p>When Mr. Davenport was a very young artist he traveled, as all young artist ought
                  to do, to see something of the faces and places beyond his immediate vicinity.</p>
               <p>Stopping for a few days at a small village, which was snugly nestled between two
                  mountains, he plunged into the wilds in search of game every morning at
                  sunrise.</p>
               <p>On the third day he met with a young hunter, a year or two his junior, and they
                  agreed to unite their fortunes for the day and hunt together. When they parted
                  that evening they were well pleased with their day's companionship, and proposed
                  to meet at the same place and hour on the following morning, and continue their
                  hunt and acquaintanceship.</p>
               <p>Their excursions were attended by so much success and pleasure, they were
                  continued day after day for over a week.</p>
               <p>One evening, as they were approaching their rendezvous, and about to separate
                  there, the frank young stranger said to him,—</p>
               <p>"I wish you would tell me your name, and come home with me. I have been
                  interesting my mother and sister with an account of our meetings and adventures,
                  and it was only last night when they asked me how we could talk so much without
                  knowing each other's names, that I was reminded of the gentle Juliet's words on
                  the insignificance of a name. However, as we know the names of every tree, beast,
                  and bird we see, it does not seem proper that we should be less intimate with
                  ourselves; so I told them that your name was Robin Hood, and that I was Little
                  John, and promised to bring you home, dead or alive, and let them see you."</p>
               <p>The young artist was pleased with his companion's<pb n="196-197"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000099"/> ion's artlessness, but declined his invitation,
                  saying that there was always a romance attached to mystery, and by revealing
                  himself he would destroy the interest their imagination had surrounded him
                  with.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, you need not fear that; after I have told so many things about you, you
                  must come with me and substantiate them. We live secluded here a few months each
                  year, having no acquaintance with the people around us; and women are so curious,
                  you know, that they must be told about everything I see when I go home at night."
                  And a proud toss of his head indicated how conscious he was of the superiority of
                  men.</p>
               <p>Before he had decided whether to accompany the youth or not, they met his sister,
                  and he was introduced to her as "the unknown ranger of the forests." She had been
                  selecting wild flowers, and the artist, with his professional eye for beauty,
                  thought he had never before seen so beautiful a woman; but, great as her beauty
                  was, her refined manners and unstudied cordiality were still more irresistible to
                  him.</p>
               <p>Tossing the flowers into her basket, she prepared to accompany them, saying,
                  without the slightest appearance of embarrassment,—</p>
               <p>"My brother Perry has entertained us every evening with an account of your daily
                  travels and conversations, and we owe much to you for the many pleasant titbits of
                  wit and humor he has brought home to us. We have made a rule not to use artificial
                  light while we live in the country, and therefore Perry's adventures supply the
                  place of books in our evening's entertainments, which I hope will not make him
                  vain and egotistical, though I fear it will, for he already talks as if he was
                  dressed in Lincoln-green, and one of the bold archers of Sherwood Forest, with you
                  for his chief."</p>
               <p>This skillful effort to learn his name was successful, and he was in return
                  informed of the names of the brother and sister; and then there was a general
                  laugh at the impersonality of the young men, who had not discovered their want of
                  names for a week.</p>
               <p>They had not proceeded far before they came to the house, and as he was about to
                  leave them she added her entreaties to her brother's, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, you must come in and be introduced to our mother! It is seldom we see a
                  stranger here, and we must make the most of one when we do;" and as "must" was the
                  language of her eyes, he had neither the inclination nor the power to disobey
                  them.</p>
               <p>He was evidently the more bashful of the two, for there was a frank boldness in
                  her manner towards him that convinced him he was regarded as a boy like her
                  brother Perry, or in some other respect as one that she need not be afraid to make
                  free with.</p>
               <p>As he yielded and entered the house, he was presented to the mother, who welcomed
                  him with matronly kindness, and said she already felt quite<pb n="198-199"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000100"/> well acquainted with him through her son's
                  conversations.</p>
               <p>The flower himself was at last ensnared; Perry's romance, enthusiasm, and
                  impulsiveness, his mother's gentle interest in him, and her communicative suavity,
                  and her daughter's bewitching beauty, had all conspired to make him a prisoner,
                  and for a time all thoughts of "moving on" were forgotten.</p>
               <p>As he studied and learned the tastes and preferences of the peerless beauty, his
                  plans of life and labor were rough-hewn anew, and she was encircled in every
                  dream, hope, and thought of the future—the center of every ambition and
                  aspiration.</p>
               <p>I will say at once that he was in love, but his love, from the beginning to the
                  end, had no hope in it; it was not the love that is usually successful, for it
                  savored too much of adoration; with the feelings she inspired in him he would
                  almost as soon have dreamed of marrying an angel.</p>
               <p>Though young and untraveled, he had an intuitive knowledge of human nature, and
                  knew that he could not hope for her love as long as she could treat him with the
                  same ease and freedom of manner her brother shared in common with him; but when
                  absent he overcame his extreme reverence for her.</p>
               <p>Her diamond eyes were dovelike in the distance, and then he could look forward to
                  a time when they would no longer awe him, but rather beam on him with soft
                  affection; for they inspired him with too much veneration to allow him to pay any
                  marked attentions to her while he was within their range.</p>
               <p>One glance of the bright, unflinching optics would dry up the fountain of thought
                  he had to pour at her feet, and as long as he was near her he could not think of a
                  word to say in plea for his passion.</p>
               <p>He at last resorted to the more feasible way of writing a sonnet to speak for him,
                  and thought it would be easy for him to judge what he might hope for by watching
                  her countenance as she read it. The lines were not preserved, I believe, and even
                  if they had been it would not be necessary to insert them here; for all such
                  effusions breathe essentially the same spirit,—"lure," "pure," "near," "dear,"
                  "moon," "boon," and "never," "sever" flow after each other as naturally as the
                  notes of birds in the spring, when the pairing-time makes them tuneful.</p>
               <p>He handed them to her, and, with his heart firmly braced to bear the consequences
                  of his boldness, whatever they might be, he anxiously watched to mark their
                  effect.</p>
               <p>He soon saw it, for, with a burst of laughter, she cried out, as she thrust them
                  back into his hand,—</p>
               <p>"Come, come, sir! that will never do! If you would play the gay deceiver you must
                  learn the art of duplicity better than that. I am too honest<pb n="200-201"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000101"/> to take the praise which does not belong to me: you
                  have written that document for some other damsel, I see; for if you will take the
                  trouble to look into my eyes you will discover that they are of a 'fast black,'
                  instead of the 'changeable heavenly blue' which appears to have robbed you of your
                  customary wit and discrimination."</p>
               <p>Invited, he looked boldly into her eyes for the first time, and not only found
                  them "black," as she said, but saw in them how little love he could hope for when
                  they could read a love ditty so critically, and laugh so merrily at his blunder,
                  stupid as it was of him.</p>
               <p>A wit, a jester, or a clown feels successful in proportion to the laughter he
                  calls from his audience; but the bitterest feeling one so earnest as a lover can
                  have, is to know that to please a woman he had made himself ridiculous, and she
                  laughed at him for his pains.</p>
               <p>The loss of herself was aggravated by the fancied loss of her respect; for she was
                  about a year his senior, and in maturity of mind several years, which made him
                  more sensitive of her ridicule, and apprehensive of having earned it.</p>
               <p>His dream of love was over, the first one he had had, and he soon discovered that
                  the summer was not the time to hunt for game, and took his leave of the
                  mountains.</p>
               <p>This beauty was Robert's mother, and at the time Mr. Davenport had seen her first
                  she was already the betrothed of another, to whom she was married soon after her
                  return to the city,—the autumn following.</p>
               <p>They lived in the same city, and though the happy bride soon forgot the sensitive
                  artist, and the rhyme he treated her to, she was never forgotten by him.</p>
               <p>A few years afterwards he had recovered from his chagrin and his love-sickness so
                  far that he wooed and won another; but though he was thankful that he was denied
                  one in order to get another more after his own heart, he had a brother's interest
                  in the heroine of his romantic passion by the mountains, and in the City of
                  Brotherly Love he did not altogether lose sight of her family.</p>
               <p>Perry filled an early grave, and his mother soon followed him; while ten years
                  after her marriage, Lucille, the daughter and sister, was left a widow. She also
                  followed her husband to the tomb, and left her only child to breast the storms of
                  life without a parent.</p>
               <p>When time had blunted the poignancy of his refusal, Mr. Davenport was both pleased
                  and thankful to her for the tact with which she had kindly saved him from a
                  straightforward denial, and he would prefer the power of doing her a favor in
                  return to any other desire in life; and now the way seemed to be open at last.</p>
               <p>There was no inheritance left to her orphan to require administration and
                  guardianship from his relatives, and when Mr. Davenport, whose disinterested<pb
                     n="202-203" xml:id="VAC6133-00000102"/> terested kindness was the great romance
                  of hi life, came forward and offered to adopt him, there was no objection urged
                  against it by those who had the right to be his protectors and guardians, by
                  reason of relationship to him.</p>
               <p>There is no authentic information to the effect that the kind-hearted Mrs.
                  Davenport ever knew why her husband was so interested in a strange boy that he
                  took him into the family; no doubt she thought it was for the genius his
                  discriminating eye had discovered in the embryo artist; but even if she had known
                  it, she was far too sensible and too benevolent herself to be jealous of a
                  sentiment which could never take a more sinister form of expression.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenport used to delight to walk up on the heights with Robert before he
                  became an invalid, and impart his experiences to him for his instruction and
                  amusement; and it was on one of those trips that he told him of his short but
                  eventful acquaintance with his mother. If there was anything wanting to increase
                  his love and veneration for the artist, it would have been supplied by the tender
                  and affectionate manner he spoke of his mother, after a lapse of twenty years, and
                  when both she and Mrs. Davenport were resting in Laurel Hill Cemetery, where no
                  one is jealous or envious.</p>
               <p>The parting was therefore the more affecting to both, because of the sentiment of
                  their relationship; and the old artist still held Robert's hand as if he would say
                  more, after he had said good-by several times to him.</p>
               <p>There was a time, perhaps, when he dreamed that his daughter and the son of the
                  dazzling Lucille might love each other as he had loved the mountain-nymph, and his
                  unuttered thoughts might have recalled it; but even before he had suspected Lucy's
                  affections of learning in another direction, he saw Rosy Heywood, another waif of
                  his kindness, step into the niche he had designed for his daughter, and the fond
                  dream had been dispelled long ago by that demonstrative and irrepressible
                  girl.</p>
               <p>But, setting sentimentalism aside, it was natural that Mr. Davenport should like
                  to see the love of his daughter transferred to the only one he knew to be worthy
                  of it, and have more hopes of her happiness by seeing her united to the one who
                  had from her childhood showed himself in temper and disposition an agreeable
                  companion to her.</p>
               <p>With Lucy herself his parting was very affecting, for she was now more in want of
                  his sympathy than she could confess, since her father's coldness, and the
                  inutility of Rosamond's advice, left her sadly in need of a friend in whom, as one
                  of the family, she could confide her cares and anxieties. She wept as he told her
                  that he was about to leave them and go so far away, and took no more pains to
                  conceal or suppress her tears than if they had been those of a sister.</p>
               <p>"Now, Lucy dear, your father loves you as much<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000103"/> as he ever did, and when the feelings which his
                  marriage has created will have lost their strangeness, and you both become used to
                  the new order of things, you will be able to feel towards each other as you always
                  have felt. You must be cheerful, and not let him see that you have taken it to
                  heart, so that he will not be diffident about showing his affection for you, as he
                  is now, from a conviction that you did not like to have him marry Sarah. I may be
                  back in a year or two at most, and then we will have the same old times over
                  again. Write to me every week about your father's health, and anything else you
                  can think of, and I will answer every letter. If he should not recover, remember
                  you will have in me a friend upon whose care you can, and have a right to, rely as
                  long as I live," he said, as they parted on the porch.</p>
               <p>Rosamond proposed to walk down the avenue with him, and the carriage which was to
                  convey him and his trunk to the railroad was driven ahead of them.</p>
               <p>She was nervous and excited, and talked rapidly all the way about making a
                  fortune, as if to conceal her feelings at parting.</p>
               <p>Robert did not, however, perceive the ruse, and was disappointed because their
                  last moments were employed so little to his taste; for he will knew she would be
                  in his mind while away just as he had found her when taking leave of her, and he
                  was chagrined by the lightness of her conversation when he was undertaking the
                  journey solely for her sake.</p>
               <p>The only thing he had to fan the sinking flame in his breast was the hope that he
                  did not understand her, and that beneath her fickle and unsatisfactory surface she
                  was concealing truth, firmness, and devotion, which his equally unsatisfactory
                  declaration of love would not let her betray.</p>
               <p>The earnest desire to have all causes for reserve removed, and learn more of her
                  heart in half an hour, by telling her that he loved her and wanted her love in
                  return, than he could know in a lifetime without doing it, came back to him with
                  redoubled force, for she was a mystery to him that he longed to solve. He would
                  have done it, even had he been assured that she would have proved false to her
                  troth and married some one else during his absence, but he also thought she might
                  remain true to him, to her own disadvantage, and then the words of the simple
                  ballad,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Five years have rolled round,</l>
                        <l>And I have not a dollar,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> occurred to his mind, and the fate of the patient "Evelina" deterred him from
                  asking Rosamond to also await an event which might be equally long deferred.</p>
               <p>She disturbed his meditations by saying, in a light manner,—</p>
               <p>"Now, Bob, while you grow a rich merchant, do<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000104"/> not allow yourself to contract those shop-airs so
                  many of your brotherhood carry about them, as if advertising their business; but,
                  remember, you have always hated affectation, and do not let your wealth and your
                  wares be seen in your walk and your manners as well as in your warehouse."</p>
               <p>"I wish you would not be always harping on 'business,' Rosy; for you make me fear
                  that you are quizzing me, and you should be the last one to do that, since you
                  have said so much to encourage me in this step," he said, impatiently.</p>
               <p>"Which proves that I am not quizzing you, or making light of our laudable
                  enterprise, unless I could be guilty of not only misleading a friend, but also of
                  stultifying myself."</p>
               <p>"Well, I do not think you would do either; this is the last time we shall see each
                  other for many a day, and I would be glad to believe something better of you. I
                  want to think of you, Rosy, as a talisman that is to aid me, and not as the fickle
                  and unreliable creature you often appear to wish yourself taken for," he said,
                  warmly.</p>
               <p>"Wish myself taken, or rather mistaken, for a fickle, unreliable creature? Why,
                  Bob Heberton, was there ever a creature so slandered to her face before? No, sir;
                  I want you to think me all that your fancy can paint me,—endowed with every
                  perfection,—and not one quality which even yourself could, by distortion, construe
                  into a fault," she answered, with a comic effort to severely rebuke him.</p>
               <p>He wistfully looked at her, as if he would willingly believe all this, if he
                  could, and she tried to look gravely, as if conscious of deserving it, whether he
                  believed it or not.</p>
               <p>For awhile their eyes were fixed on each other, as if their sincerity depended on
                  the strength of their stare, and then both laughed.</p>
               <p>This was Robert's <foreign xml:lang="LAT">pons asinorum,</foreign> and he could
                  never pass it in his endeavors to reach her heart; for she was too skillful in
                  parrying his sober earnestness by destroying his equilibrium just as he reached a
                  point which she appeared to have marked for his discomfiture, and left him no
                  other resource but to skirmish with indirect speeches, pointed by feigned feelings
                  and witty retorts.</p>
               <p>He was used to her tactics, and looked to follow her well enough when time
                  permitted; but he had none to waste now, and he therefore said, with some
                  impatience of manner,—</p>
               <p>"Now, Rosy, I wish you would be serious for a few moments, and then I will say
                  good-by to you. Can you remember the promise you made me that day my thigh was
                  broken on the hill yonder?—let us now understand it, and each other."</p>
               <p>"Why, I thought that was all understood; and I am certain that I know my part well
                  enough,—it is merely to pass judgement whenever you present before my honor a
                  trembling victim for the hymeneal altar, and no more: that is simple enough for a
                  child to comprehend."</p>
               <p>"Bah! you are neither a child nor a fool, that<pb n="208-209"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000105"/> my meaning was not evident enough to you; and I
                  wish you would let me say the few words time will permit me, without any of this
                  foolish disguise or equivocation," he answered.</p>
               <p>The color and nervousness returned again, and she seemed alarmed by his
                  earnestness; but quickly rallying, she said, with a confidential tone, which wore
                  his patience entirely out,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, Bob, I understood you well enough; and I would not have given my consent
                  to your marriage with her had you asked for it, though I suppose you would marry
                  her without it, had she not saved you by marrying uncle. And now, as all you said
                  had reference to her, I suppose you wish to be released from a promise which you
                  would never have kept?"</p>
               <p>"Rosy, you would wear out the patience of a saint, and the last lesson you will
                  teach me is what I have learned from you a thousand times before. Will nothing
                  make you sincere and candid for one half-hour? You would equivocate at the altar,
                  and Death himself would not find you willing to lay aside your everlasting
                  coquetry!" he cried, in despair.</p>
               <p>"What would you have me do, pray? cry, and let you see how much I feel your
                  departure? Why, I would spoil you by flattery, and I do not want to see you like
                  other only brothers,—full of their own importance. You must come back as you go
                  away, neither more nor less of you, and you will find us, at least Lucy and
                  myself, just the same, and no more than as you left us," she said.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, so be it, with all my heart," he cried, and he drew her to his
                  breast.</p>
               <p>She did not either resist or return his embrace, for her arms hung passively by
                  her side; but when he was going off, and turned for a last look at her, she kissed
                  her hand to him, and he went away satisfied.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>THOUGH Mr. Davenport was proud of Robert's enterprising spirit, and had high hopes
                  of his success, yet his departure left him a disconsolate man, and his mind became
                  greatly depressed in consequence. He deemed himself rapidly sinking, and the
                  consciousness of having done a very foolish act by getting married made him
                  unhappy and morose.</p>
               <p>His wife was not a companion for him, and between himself and his daughter there
                  was a gulf made by his folly beyond which neither could pass; so that since
                  Robert—with whom alone he could discuss the misunderstanding—had gone away, there
                  was no one to share his griefs or look to for sympathy.</p>
               <p>While his daughter was treated with kindness and respect by his wife, he felt that
                  he had made her more of a guest in the house than she ought to be; for he never
                  saw her except in his wife's presence, and she was as backward in forcing herself
                  upon his society as if she had been a stranger.</p>
               <p>As he grew more feeble, there was a change in his manner; he noticed her more,
                  addressed his words to her oftener, and at length called upon her to do many
                  little offices which his wife had been in the habit of doing; for if Sarah did not
                  make a loving bride, she became, at least, a good nurse, which was more to the
                  purpose.</p>
               <p>Lucy evinced a willingness to be reconciled and a gladness to serve him that
                  gained much upon his affections, notwithstanding that she knew herself to be
                  innocent of anything which ought to have alienated them from her. There was a
                  dignity under all her devotedness and love that had been mortally wounded, and the
                  old feelings could never be restored again; for her heart had fine chords in it,
                  which, when once touched by an unkind deed, would vibrate while its pulsations
                  lasted, though the hand that touched them could well be forgiven.</p>
               <p>Gradually the duty of giving him his medicine devolved upon his daughter; for he
                  said she could read Latin better than his wife; but as the directions were
                  uniformly in plain English, as they ought to be, this reason had not much weight
                  in it.</p>
               <p>The truth was that, as his daughter regained the confidence his wife had
                  undermined, the latter became odious to him, and the weakness of his mental powers
                  decreasing with his physical, he finally refused to take any medicine from
                  her.</p>
               <p>His reluctance to take anything from his wife became so palpable and strong that
                  it amounted to a suspicion of treachery, and, being so interpreted by her, she
                  became cold, indignant, and defiant.</p>
               <p>Whatever else Sarah was deficient in, she could always boast of a good, politic
                  judgment, and, were she even without human tenderness, self-interest<pb
                     n="212-213" xml:id="VAC6133-00000107"/> interest would not let her wish her
                  husband evil, as her object had been attained by her marriage, and its possession
                  was guaranteed by his life rather than by his death.</p>
               <p>I have forgotten to mention that soon after they had returned home I went out to
                  congratulate Mr. Davenport and his wife, as if ignorant of the part I had
                  involuntarily played in bringing their marriage about.</p>
               <p>There was not much to congratulate them upon, certainly; but I contrived to say
                  some things customary to a wedding, and was able to counterfeit smiles to sustain
                  my words. Mr. Davenport coldly, though civilly, thanked me; but it was a part of
                  my acting to overlook any coldness and come out there occasionally as if nothing
                  had been revealed to me.</p>
               <p>Rosamond was present when the hollow form of congratulation was spoken; and to
                  hide her feelings, whatever they were, she thrust her hand into her deep literary
                  pocket, and appeared to search diligently for something deposited there.</p>
               <p>As I turned to Mrs. Davenport, who had then entered, the hand dived and rolled in
                  the pocket like a porpoise in the water, and her eyes peered down after it, while
                  there was a nervous twitching of the lips, as if she found it difficult to
                  restrain a smile of scorn or merriment.</p>
               <p>I imagined she was despising me, as her brows knit in thoughtful surprise at the
                  disappearance of her treasure from her pocket, and I resolved to say nothing to
                  the bride, at least, that could be called hypocrisy.</p>
               <p>She had often said the most sarcastic and severe things to me with the smile of an
                  angel on her face, and I think I had learned a little from her; for I know my face
                  broke into smiles of pleasure, and my lips parted as if to utter benevolent
                  blessings, while I took her hand with affectionate respect and hissed,—</p>
               <p>"Sarah, you have the devil's genius for deceit, and will also have his reward for
                  using it so well."</p>
               <p>"Edward, you were always so witty and complimentary," she replied in the same
                  undertone, while smiles and blushes mantled her cheeks, as if I had wished her
                  health, heirs, and happiness to the end of a long life.</p>
               <p>My first visit being successful, I did not want for occasions for calling again,
                  and before Robert had departed I had been there three times.</p>
               <p>When news of the safe arrival of the steamer Robert went to Aspinwall in was
                  telegraphed, I went out to bring them word, and, as usual, was welcomed by all in
                  the family.</p>
               <p>Dr. Boynton was now a visitor there; for, being an old friend of Mrs. Davenport,
                  he was invited by her, while Rosamond, by her coquettish way of quizzing him,
                  seemed to second the invitation.</p>
               <p>Out of respect to me, Lucy came into the parlor, when I had talked as much to her
                  father as I could without fatiguing him; for I am sure she would not sit there
                  otherwise while Dr. Boynton was<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC6133-00000108"/> making
                  his silly impertinences to Rosamond. She was as much grieved as I was to see her
                  cousin pursue a course of flirtation with the doctor, which was not deserved or
                  expected by Robert.</p>
               <p>At the hour for medicine Lucy was called out to give it to her father, and, taking
                  advantage of her absence, the doctor so far forgot his respect to Rosamond as to
                  stretch himself out on a lounge, asking me to excuse him; but never, by look or
                  word, seeming to think the lady who was entertaining him ought to be asked for
                  permission or pardon.</p>
               <p>I looked at Rosamond in surprise, perhaps expecting her to ask me to kick him out
                  for his ill manners, and then she colored deeply, and said, in a tone that was
                  intended to be resentful,—</p>
               <p>"And won't you ask me to excuse you at all, sir? Do you not think I am entitled to
                  any apologies for such a lazy disposition of your limbs?"</p>
               <p>The laugh that followed her reproof did not hide her mortification at his letting
                  me see how little respect he had for her presence; but he took it in jest, and
                  carelessly replied,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes, certainly: excuse me, Miss Rosy. I have had a long drive this morning,
                  and am tired, you know."</p>
               <p>"Yes, 'I know' physicians are always running about, if their own words are to be
                  taken for it; they are called here and there, rung up at night, and whispered out
                  of church on Sunday," she retorted.</p>
               <p>"I do not know much about being called 'there,' or 'whispered out of church,' as I
                  never go into one, or being 'rung up in the night;' but I confess I am called
                  'here' often by that much-abused medium of circulation, my heart," he replied.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I believe you have circulated it pretty extensively, and as your life
                  depends on keeping the circulation up, I hope you will not allow it to stop," she
                  said, with sarcasm too well disguised for his intellectual keenness.</p>
               <p>I did not wait to hear the reply, but stepped out on the veranda, where Lucy, who
                  was just returning from her father's room, joined me, and I proposed a short walk.
                  I looked upon myself as her suitor, and had taken her father's cold invitation to
                  come out often for an assent to my attentions to his daughter, and did not think
                  anything else except her own assent was necessary to our marriage.</p>
               <p>When we had walked some distance from the house, I thought I had as good an
                  opportunity then as I would have at any future time for discovering how I was
                  progressing, as her ready, and even eager, assent to the walk gave me hope that my
                  company was agreeable to her.</p>
               <p>"I left Dr. Boynton alone with Miss Heywood, because I thought he was very far
                  gone in his lovesickness, and would, at any moment, bring on the crisis," I
                  said.</p>
               <p>"I do not see what he can hope for from Cousin Rosy; for she has not even respect
                  for him, at least for his character, much less love," she hastily replied.</p>
               <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC6133-00000109"/>
               <p>"You think, then, I suppose, that respect is inseparable from love?" I
                  observed.</p>
               <p>"Yes; why not? Are there any who deny it?" she asked, in return.</p>
               <p>"Yes; a great many deny it, practically, by accepting and marrying those whose
                  peculiarities they laugh at," I said.</p>
               <p>"Peculiarities do not cover Dr. Boynton's faults entirely; though, for the respect
                  I have to manhood, I hope they are peculiar to himself. My father and you and
                  Robert, who comprise my world of observation, do not show any relationship to his
                  peculiar species, and if the rest of the world were like him, where do all the
                  heroes and great men we hear and read about come from?" she said.</p>
               <p>I could not help laughing; it seemed so strange to me to hear one who was
                  naturally very careful to say nothing severe against an offender, however strongly
                  she would condemn the offense in the abstract, speak so harshly of one man to
                  another only a little longer in the circle of her acquaintances.</p>
               <p>I accounted for it to myself, first, because she disliked to see her cousin flirt
                  with him, but mostly because I had won her confidence; and that gave me confidence
                  in myself, and hurried me on in my love career.</p>
               <p>"Your candor is quite refreshing, and I am much obliged to you for your favorable
                  classification of myself," I said, as soon as I could suppress an inclination to
                  crow aloud over my anticipated triumph.</p>
               <p>"Why not? Is it not best to be candid in anything in which good and bad, right and
                  wrong, are contrasted? And a good opinion is a thing which a person earns and has
                  a right to, rather than what he must feel obliged for," she returned, with a sweet
                  earnestness which thrilled me.</p>
               <p>"I must take some exceptions to the philosophy of your last clause, since an
                  opinion often depends on the taste and character of the person who forms it. What
                  would you think of such a wise and discriminating person as Mrs. Davenport
                  preferring the doctor to me? She has done so on a great many occasions, and,
                  though it was before you knew either of us, we have not changed much since then,"
                  I said, with some tremulousness, for I was about to make a confession, having
                  heard her once express herself in regard to broken engagements, and thinking it
                  due to her frank nature to tell her all about mine before I asked her to take
                  Sarah's place.</p>
               <p>"I do not know what to think of it," she said, thoughtfully looking at me.</p>
               <p>"Yes," I continued, "she and I were engaged to be married once, and we had many a
                  quarrel before our engagement was broken off about this same Dr. Boynton; not that
                  I was so self-distrustful as to be jealous of him in particular, but that she
                  would go to greater lengths with him than with more dangerous beaux, and, like
                  Cæsar, I should want to see the name of her who becomes my wife above reproach.
                  The engagement was not broken<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC6133-00000110"/> off
                  directly on his account, I am glad to say; but it was because of her capricious
                  conduct and flirting with him that we were so ready to break it off when a less
                  important matter gave us opportunity."</p>
               <p>The reader will see that I did not bear very heavily on myself in this confession;
                  but who will condemn themselves, being their own judges?</p>
               <p>"It is very good and polite of you to meet the doctor and Mrs. Davenport so
                  pleasantly after the sorrow they have caused you; and I think Rosy should be more
                  careful, and not encourage his foolish attentions," she said.</p>
               <p>I was immediately sorry that I had not told her I had been once engaged, without
                  connecting the doctor or her stepmother with it; but it was too late, and I said,
                  jumping at once to the vital question,—</p>
               <p>"It ought to be the cause of thankfulness now to me, since the love I wasted on
                  her has been transferred to one more worthy of it, and far better suited in temper
                  and disposition to my taste; and I will bless both Sarah and the doctor for their
                  flirtations if you, Lucy, will tell me that this time my love is given to one who
                  will appreciate it and repay it a thousand times with her own."</p>
               <p>She turned to me with a look of the most unfeigned surprise, and asked, in a
                  hurried, earnest manner,—</p>
               <p>"Do you mean that you love me, Mr. Pearson?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, all that and far more, too, since the same words would be used to express
                  love more lightly felt and more lightly deserved," I replied, feeling confident
                  that she would at once confess as frankly as she had spoken on every other
                  subject, that her surprise had been an agreeable one, and I could have her and
                  welcome.</p>
               <p>I was sadly mistaken, however, for in a moment her look was one of sincere regret,
                  and she feelingly said,—</p>
               <p>"I am very sorry that I can give you no more than my sincere thanks for the
                  feelings you have expressed, Mr. Pearson; but that is all I can return, sensible
                  as I am of how worthy you are of the love of a true woman."</p>
               <p>I was confounded for a moment by her reply; she spoke like one who had more
                  experience and had reflected more on the subject than I had expected; but I
                  rallied, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you think less of me after what I have just confessed; but I can assure
                  you that you have my love as fully as if I had never spoken of it to any other
                  woman: do not doubt that, I beg of you!"</p>
               <p>She pressed my arm warmly and caressingly, and replied, in the same sincere
                  way,—</p>
               <p>"Indeed, I do not; I believe you would not say so unless you loved me truly, and
                  it grieves me to think of it. I did not expect such a declaration, and I can never
                  forgive myself if I have by a word or look ever encouraged a passion which I could
                  not reciprocate."</p>
               <p>"You have not, I assure you! It is because you<pb n="220-221"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000111"/> have inspired rather than encouraged it that I have
                  confessed it. Perhaps I have been too abrupt; you have not thought of it and have
                  not seen enough of me to say yes or no. I shall let it rest for your future
                  consideration," I said.</p>
               <p>"No, no, Mr. Pearson! though unexpected, my answer to you would be the same at any
                  time. From the first time I saw you I have entertained the highest respect for
                  you, and by the pleasure you have always given us you have added to that respect a
                  warm interest; but nothing more could happen had you let the question remain open
                  for any length of time; and I cannot encourage you to do it."</p>
               <p>This was enough; for, though spoken in a soft, affectionate tone, I knew she was
                  in earnest, and, feeling sorely disappointed, I turned to take her back to the
                  house.</p>
               <p>With her hand pressing still on my arm, she said, in a pleading, sisterly
                  way,—</p>
               <p>"No, do not let us return yet; let us walk up this hill. You look grieved, and I
                  do not want to let you go away so, for you would never come back to us again, and
                  we all would miss you and be disappointed."</p>
               <p>I turned with her again, and she continued,—</p>
               <p>"If you will only let me be as sister to you, we will always love each other! I am
                  sure that is the way we feel, only just now, because there were no blood ties, you
                  forgot yourself, and thought you felt differently."</p>
               <p>I shook my head ominously, though I began to suspect that my disappointment arose
                  from wounded vanity, and was not of that deep, suicidal nature which should
                  characterize a wild, passionate love such as we read of in some novels.</p>
               <p>She, however, penetrated the gloomy atmosphere of my countenance, and, still
                  pressing my arm, she smilingly said,—</p>
               <p>"It would not do for you to make such a declaration to some young ladies, you
                  know; for they would feel so flattered that you would be accepted at once, and
                  then you would have to make the best of a poor mate, if your love was not that of
                  a true, lasting, marriageable kind: all are not philosophers and metaphysicians
                  like I am, and are not able to discriminate like your sister."</p>
               <p>Between her caresses on my arm, her evident sympathy, and her sweet endeavors to
                  make me feel humorous and pleasant, my disappointment was melting away very
                  rapidly. I became more confident that my self-esteem rather than my heart was hurt
                  by the refusal; and if I were alone I could have cuffed my own head for being such
                  a fool as to mistake my feelings; but, as she went on coaxing me in her tender,
                  artless way, I made my face longer, and looked the more gloomy as she tried to
                  make me smile.</p>
               <p>"Forgive me if I have wounded your feelings by seeming to lightly regard what you
                  have said to me. I do not; I do not, I assure you!" she<pb n="222-223"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000112"/> said, becoming saddened again by the increased
                  length of my face.</p>
               <p>I felt mean and hypocritical, and would, if my fear of her contempt had let me,
                  tell her, with equal frankness, that I was more mortified at my mistake than
                  disappointed in love, but I merely replied,—</p>
               <p>"No; you are too good and too sensible, Lucy, to make light of what saddens
                  another."</p>
               <p>"You are right, my dear friend. <q>
                     <l>'Taught by the power that pities me,'</l>
                  </q> I esteem whatever makes a fellow-creature sad or joyous a great thing, and
                  sympathize with all that affects the human heart or mind. He who trieth the heart
                  knows that I do not lightly regard what you have said to me; but what can I say,
                  or what can I do, to express my appreciation of your words, and yet at the same
                  time convince you that it is better for both that we should be no more than good,
                  faithful friends?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing; you have said enough to prove how good you are, Lucy——"</p>
               <p>"That is right! Call me Lucy always, and I will call you Edward, and you shall see
                  what fine, old-fashioned friends we will be!" she excultingly exclaimed.</p>
               <p>I could no longer hold out under such a storm of tenderness and entreaty, and I
                  accepted her proposition, while I tried to keep her from doubting that she would
                  be more acceptable to me as a wife than as a sister. I drew her head to me, and
                  imprinting a kiss on her smooth, white forehead, I said,—</p>
               <p>"Well, then, good-by, sweetheart Lucy, and welcome, sister Lucy! If such a
                  transition must be, the sooner I realize it the better."</p>
               <p>"There, now, that is right! spoken like what I always took you to be," she said,
                  looking into my face and taking my hands, as if I was a patient just recovering
                  from a paroxysm and herself was the physician.</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is all over, Lucy," I said, contriving, however, to keep my face from
                  indorsing my words too readily; for, besides being ashamed of the lightness of my
                  passion, I imagined she would not like me less for breaking my heart a little for
                  her.</p>
               <p>I fear I make myself appear a very deceitful man, a male flirt, for keeping up the
                  appearance of a passion that I knew to be illusory; but I did not pretend to it
                  for the sake of urging it further; but rather, like a general, made a show of
                  long, heavy lines, to cover my real weakness and retreat. Only I was afraid she
                  would think me silly, I would have thanked her at once for not listening to my
                  professions of love; for if there is such a thing as the love the poets and
                  romancers tell us about, almost an inspiration, we would have married without it,
                  and discovered our error when too late. We would have spoiled sound friendship to
                  make spurious love, like many before us; and I<pb n="224-225"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000113"/> think if women were the wooers instead of the wooed
                  this would not be a common occurrence. They are better judges of the passion, if
                  they are of the sensible kind, and they more readily distinguish between it and
                  esteem or respect; but not being the suitors, they too often accept what is
                  offered to them rather than risk getting nothing more.</p>
               <p>Lucy and myself became lively in a few moments, and now that we were in a groove
                  out of which we could not slip, we talked of family matters.</p>
               <p>After a few remarks about her father's marriage with Sarah, she said,—</p>
               <p>"Your engagement with Sarah surprises me; tell me all about it, if it is not a
                  painful subject to you; it must be very interesting, for she was always such a
                  clever, brilliant girl."</p>
               <p>"No, it is not at all painful to think of, only sometimes a little mortifying, as
                  in all cases where people recover from love-sickness, and discover how irrational
                  and pettish they were while the fever was upon them. There are other things
                  connected with my acquaintance with Sarah which make it disagreeable to me to
                  think or speak of now. Robert was my confidant all the time, and when he returns
                  to you he will tell you about it, and the miserable time I had with her."</p>
               <p>I meant when he had returned to the family, but she interpreted <emph>you</emph>
                  in the singular, and while she gasped for breath, a flush overspread her face, and
                  a flash of light burst from her calm blue eyes.</p>
               <p>Either her eyes became dark after the sudden illumination, and her face vacant of
                  any expression, or else my vision became so impaired by the discovery, so
                  startling, so evident, and so unexpected, for all was dark and indistinct to me
                  for a few moments afterwards.</p>
               <p>"Here," said I, while my eyes were dimly looking over the distant hills,—"here is
                  a desperate case of cross-love! I in love with Lucy, she loves Robert, he loves
                  Rosamond, and she apparently thinks of falling in love with the doctor! Can there
                  be anything in surgical experience, or in the records of the <title>London
                     Lancet,</title> more hopelessly cross-eyed than we appear to be in our
                  affections?"</p>
               <p>I was about to form a sentimental pity for myself at first, as the only one in the
                  party who had no one's love; but in an instant my selfishness was forgotten, and I
                  pitied the girl beside me, who, I was sure, had felt the passion longer and more
                  deeply than I could comprehend. She was herself in a moment, and reading my
                  thoughts wrong, she thought I was relapsing into another fit of love melancholy,
                  and said, in a cheerful mood, to arouse me from it,—</p>
               <p>"Do you not think the doctor has had time to 'say his say?' As you are old
                  acquaintances, you must be aware that he cannot say much without repeating the
                  same words over; and, as Rosy has intelligence enough to comprehend their full
                  meaning at the first speaking, she must be wearied by this time."</p>
               <pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC6133-00000114"/>
               <p>"She appears to like listening to him, however," I replied, carelessly.</p>
               <p>"How can she help being polite to him? And he mistakes her smiles of amusement for
                  smiles of appreciation," she said, noticing my sarcasm.</p>
               <p>"You do not think she cares for him, then?"</p>
               <p>"How can she? You do not seem to know her at all; and I have often thought you
                  misjudged her,—she is more inclined to laugh than to weep at human follies; but
                  she is fully capable of appreciating better things," she returned.</p>
               <p>It was said more warmly that the preceding sentences, for they were spoken more
                  for my amusement than to abuse the doctor, and I more than ever appreciated the
                  charity and generosity that defended the one who was not only her rival, but also
                  was trifling with the man <emph>she</emph> loved.</p>
               <p>I pitied both Robert and herself. I had matched them the first night I saw them
                  together; but Cupid, who seems to delight in setting suitableness aside when
                  pairing his victims, made light of my judgment, and, in his childish wantonness,
                  mated Robert with Rosamond.</p>
               <p>It was, doubtless, because I had more faith in the blindness of love than in the
                  sight of reason and judgment, that I had followed my "jack-o'-the-lantern" passion
                  and came to grief now.</p>
               <p>I saw that Lucy was lovable, and that Robert was the destined of another; and,
                  having no one to love me, I undertook the gratuitous task of making myself her
                  lover and her beloved.</p>
               <p>But I was getting a sister's affection, and was becoming accustomed to the new
                  state of affairs very rapidly. Every moment that we lingered on the road home was
                  making our manners and feelings easier and more natural towards each other; and,
                  only for the foolishness of my mistake in thinking I loved her, I would have been
                  happy.</p>
               <p>As her qualities of heart and head became more evident and perspicuous by this
                  interview, I feared that it was only her charity and goodness which kept her from
                  seeing the weakness of my judgement, and despising me for it, and I hastened our
                  steps back to the house, to prevent her from having time to think calmly over it,
                  and withdrawing her esteem from me before I was out of her sight.</p>
               <p>But Lucy was a woman, and no man could incur her displeasure or enmity by telling
                  her, with respectful earnestness, that he loved her. I never had cause to think
                  that she liked me less for it, though I often wished I had known my mind better,
                  and spared myself the mortification of a refusal.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <p>WHEN Lucy and I had returned to the house, Dr. Boynton was gone, and we found
                  Rosamond sitting out on the veranda, with a volume of poems in her hand, which she
                  was perusing too intently to observe our approach,—as if the dull and stale
                  compliments of the doctor had left her in want of some such mental stimulant to
                  drive the <foreign xml:lang="FRA">ennui</foreign> away. She rather avoided my
                  scrutiny, as I tried to learn from her face the impression her visitor had left
                  behind him; so I bade her a hurried adieu, as I had three miles across the fields
                  to walk to the train, which left in an hour.</p>
               <p>From Lucy I received a warmer and more pressing invitation to come out soon again
                  than she had given me ever before; but Rosamond said nothing.</p>
               <p>"She doubtless feels mortified at the attitude the doctor's conduct towards her
                  has assumed, and is displeased with me for being an innocent witness of it," I
                  said, as I turned away.</p>
               <p>When I had walked about half the distance to the station, I sat down on a rock to
                  rest, and to ruminate over what I had said to Lucy and received in reply.</p>
               <p>I had not been there long when I was surprised by the doctor, who had approached
                  me, unobserved, satchel in hand, as if going to the city with me.</p>
               <p>He was excited, perspiring, and panting, and as he came up to me held out his hand
                  with a tragic gesture, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Well met, fellow-mourner! Give me your hand, for I am in the same boat with you:
                  jilted, rejected, and blighted by perfidious woman!" And he solemnly shook the
                  hand I extended to him.</p>
               <p>I comprehended his situation in a moment, but I felt the blood mount to the top of
                  my head as I was thus convinced that he was equally acquainted with mine; for the
                  greatest unpleasantness that could be attached to it was that one who had so
                  little claims on my esteem and confidence as Dr. Boynton should be privy to my
                  rejection, or anything else which concerned my heart-affairs.</p>
               <p>Without seeming to notice his reference to myself, I looked as calm and
                  sympathetic as I could, and wondered how a man with so little acuteness of
                  intellect as he had could so easily penetrate my secret; but, in order to be
                  non-committal and encouraging, I said,—</p>
               <p>"Women are the cause of all our troubles, doctor, and yet we court them!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, oh, curse them! We give them a little trouble when we first come on the
                  stage, but, by way of revenging their own faults and follies upon us, they trouble
                  and torment us all our subsequent career, as if we were to blame for our
                  appearance on it. Mr. Pearson, I have often in conversation with<pb n="230-231"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000116"/> you pretended to some knowledge of the female
                  heart, and with as good reason as any other man, because of my extensive and
                  varied association with the sex. But now I take it all back: I know nothing at all
                  about it, I never did know anything, and the conceit that I did was only a
                  pleasant delusion which has now been rudely torn from me!"</p>
               <p>I was astonished by such a burst of loquacity; for, as Lucy had wittily observed,
                  the doctor's vocabulary was not very extensive, nor his grasp of thought great
                  enough to require many words to set it off.</p>
               <p>He paused for want of breath, and to wipe the perspiration from his face, and then
                  continued, with renewed indignation and vehemence,—</p>
               <p>"I can only say this much now, as a phœnix rising out of the ashes of my past
                  experience: if a man wants to be accepted, let him sit down and think over the
                  names of those of his female acquaintance least likely to want him, and then let
                  him select the most unlikely one among them all, call on her and ask her without
                  any preliminaries. If he wants to be jilted, rejected, and blighted, let him call
                  up all his knowledge of the female heart, recall to his mind everything he has
                  heard women say about themselves, and everything he has heard from those men best
                  acquainted with them; let him think of all that novelists have written about them;
                  the coquetry of some who always pretend to like those they want to make victims
                  of; the bashfulness of others who fly from those they wish to entrap; the smiles
                  of those sharp ones who are on the lookout for young green goslings, and the
                  frankness of those whose faces are always an index to their heart; let him put all
                  his information together, and select the one who, by those sundry and divers
                  rules, has given him the most hope, ask her, and then find himself a jilted,
                  rejected, blighted man; and disappointment, like a phœnix, growing out of the
                  ashes of his hopes."</p>
               <p>He paused again, and, while I was amused at the lesson Rosamond had undoubtedly
                  taught him, and the eloquence which resulted from it, I took the opportunity of
                  suggesting that our time was short, and we had better move on towards the station
                  and discuss the matter on the way.</p>
               <p>He was, no doubt, a much-injured man in his own estimation, though I thought,
                  since his ideas were enlarged by being "jilted, rejected, and blighted," he was
                  not much injured.</p>
               <p>He proceeded further to execrate his luck and the sex, and even blamed me as if
                  responsible for his humiliation.</p>
               <p>"Oh, confound me! who could expect such an answer as I got after the way she drew
                  me on? Confound you, Pearson! why did you go out of the room just at that time,
                  and leave me alone with her? If you had remained I would never have let myself be
                  such a stupid ass as to let her take me by the ears, and then fling me over, as if
                  I was not worth my fodder. Hang her for a termagant! how she warmed me up the
                  moment she had me alone!<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC6133-00000117"/> I can never
                  look myself in the face again, but will break every glass that reminds me who I
                  am,—a jilted, rejected, and blighted man,—a phœnix of sorrow, grown out of the
                  ashes of my folly! Why did I ask her, when I know I did not want her or any one
                  else? But it was to be so; I was destined to row in the same boat with you,—tossed
                  in by Rosy Heywood, as Sarah Carroll has done with you. Galley-slaves, by
                  Jove!"</p>
               <p>I felt greatly relieved; he was thinking of my quarrel with Sarah,—and that had
                  long before ceased to hurt me; so now, his mind being exhausted of its ideas, I
                  began to question him about his rejection, having no fears that he would ask me
                  similar questions in regard to mine.</p>
               <p>Rosamond had avenged me so well that she had won my good opinion at last, and I
                  was impatient to learn what she had said which so effectually banished him and all
                  hope of renewing his suit, notwithstanding his excessive vanity. I said,
                  therefore,—</p>
               <p>"It must be very trying to be refused by a girl who does not know the value of
                  what she throws away, doctor; but perhaps you did not understand her,—she might
                  have only wanted a little coaxing. After having, as you remarked, drawn you on,
                  she was doubtless anxious to have you think you did the most courting, to save her
                  own dignity. Tell me what you said to her, and what she answered, and we will put
                  the whole thing together, and make it out; for, you know, two heads are better
                  than one."</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is all clear enough; I am dished, like a skewered chicken, with the tail
                  of my pride plucked out, like the witch plucked the tail of Tam O'Shanter's
                  mare.</p>
               <p>"The moment you left us, she turned on me like a wildcat,—I suppose for not
                  begging her pardon at first, when I begged yours; and it was really too much for
                  mortal man to remain unmoved when she looked so charming in her fury.</p>
               <p>"I had no idea of asking her before then, for my motto is, that a man is happier
                  to remain single, and let the women long for him and coax him, and then, when they
                  think they have caught him, let disappointment come, like a phœnix, from the ashes
                  of their hopes, while you throw their memory to the winds, like the witch threw
                  the tail of Tam O'Shanter's mare. Bah! on my knees to her! who would have thought
                  of such a thing?</p>
               <p>"Perfidious woman! No one could be more surprised than myself to see such a fine
                  girl make a fool of herself; it is sad to think of it, and it is mortifying to me
                  to be jilted and blighted by one who has so plainly coaxed me to have her. How she
                  did it is more than I can understand, unless, like a phœnix, she has come up from
                  the ashes of those New England witches. It makes me mad to think that a witch got
                  hold of me, and then threw me to the winds, like the witch threw the tail of Tam
                  O'Shanter's mare."</p>
               <p>Between the phœnix and the tail of "Tam O'Shanter's" mare, all hope of getting the
                     <emph>tale</emph> of<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC6133-00000118"/> his rejection
                  seemed lost to me. His various emotions on finding himself so carelessly "thrown
                  to the winds" were doubtless felt in the order in which he mentioned them above:
                  first surprise, then sadness at losing the "fine girl," then mortification, and
                  lastly, anger; and so desirous was I of getting the particulars from him, in order
                  to send them to Robert, that I invited him to spend the evening with me, for on
                  our way to the city I could not get him to say more than he told me in the few
                  first sentences, as his tautology clogged his ideas. As he was for the fortieth
                  time referring to the resuscitating powers of the phœnix, I interrupted him, and
                  anticipated his words. Surprised that I should know what was coming, he
                  exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"By Jove, old fellow, you have hit it! How did you know so well what I was going
                  to say? Ah! I know now! 'Great minds think alike,' is the old saying." And,
                  pleased at his own wit, he laughed aloud, forgetting that he had rounded his
                  sentences so often with the death and resurrection of the phœnix.</p>
               <p>Not wishing to be classed with so original a mind, I said, in explanation,—</p>
               <p>"From a grandfather of mine, whom I resemble in person, I have inherited an
                  intuitive power of catching the thoughts from a man's lips before he speaks them,
                  so that often I can keep in advance of a speaker, my eyes doing the service of my
                  ears."</p>
               <p>"Indeed! that is wonderful! and I wish, then, that your eyes had done the service
                  of my ears awhile ago, and told me, in advance, what Rosy Heywood would have said:
                  they would have saved me from the blight of listening to her," he said; and then
                  he took a fresh start, and related to me, as follows, the tale of his wrongs, only
                  I leave out his repetitions, for brevity's sake:</p>
               <p>"After all her sweet looks and words, who could have helped thinking that she was
                  dead in love with me? for she seemed ambitious of catching a man, and not on the
                  lookout for green young goslings to pluck, as Sarah Carroll used to be.</p>
               <p>"In fact, if I had been a youth in my first flirtation, I would have been
                  vanquished long ago; but I was an old trout, and it required some angling to catch
                  me. But confidence made me careless, and, taking a sudden tack on me, she got me,
                  like the witch got the tail of Tam O'Shanter's mare, before I knew what she was
                  about.</p>
               <p>"I rather think by this time she has risen in her own esteem, for she is the first
                  one that ever got the underhold of me, I can tell you, Pearson.</p>
               <p>"As soon as you went out, she stood up like a queen, and told me that, though she
                  believed my familiarity was well meant, it would be criticised to her prejudice,
                  and my visits to her had better cease. She said she was thankful for my past
                  attentions, which had been agreeable to her, though she was compelled to decline
                  any more, owing to the form they had taken.</p>
               <p>"I thought that she had despaired of getting<pb n="236-237"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000119"/> me, and wanted to drive me away out of spite, and,
                  fool-like, I fell down on my knees, and asked her to take me and give herself to
                  me, that I could not stay away from her, for I was desperately in love with
                  her.</p>
               <p>"I do not know how much more nonsense I said to her, but I know I said the same
                  thing forty times over for her accommodation, as she was looking for something in
                  her pocket all the time, and I talked on, thinking it was a written answer she had
                  prepared in expectation that I would one day forget my usual caution and go one
                  step too far.</p>
               <p>"When I was out of breath and could say no more, she coolly took her hand out of
                  her pocket, and told me that she felt highly complimented, having never before
                  flattered herself that I meant anything besides politeness by my attentions, but
                  she must decline to hear any more, and hoped that I would not give the matter
                  another thought, as she would not. Just as if either of us could forget her
                  triumph!</p>
               <p>"If she had shown any inclination to accept me, I would have backed out at once,
                  and stood a breach of promise suit; but her disdain made me the more desirous of
                  getting her, and I began the whole thing over again, when she cut me short by
                  resuming her seat, and telling me that she was waiting to say good-by whenever I
                  was done, for she had nothing else to say to me.</p>
               <p>"I suppose I did not make my declaration in the words she expected, and she was
                  disappointed when the reply she had in her pocket would not suit it; for she
                  looked angry enough to eat me. But I have taken her at her word, and my motto is,
                  let wisdom grow like a phœnix out of the ashes of experience; for I hope to be
                  jerked up like the tail of Tam O'Shanter's mare, the next time I offer myself to
                  another woman!"</p>
               <p>Well, from this day I could think better of Rosamond, for I perceived that my look
                  was not without its effect, as it was that which doubtless called up her
                  self-respect, and made her give the doctor a lesson on politeness which promised
                  to be remembered for some time to come.</p>
               <p>He lost no time in leaving the neighborhood, for with his satchel he started at
                  once for the city, intending to engage a passage in the first steamer leaving New
                  York.</p>
               <p>I had some curiosity to learn where he was desirous of going, and suggested Paris
                  as a place where he would be apt to forget his griefs; but he said,—</p>
               <p>"No, hang me if I want to go where there are so many women! when I leave this
                  bewitched neighborhood, I want to be where there are not so many witches to remind
                  me of what that one has done to me!"</p>
               <p>I suggested to him that the women he would meet in Paris would be more bent on
                  looking in the milliners' shops than for husbands; but he declared that even while
                  shopping they did not forget their coquetry, and related to me an adventure he had
                  with Rosamond a few days before, which more<pb n="238-239"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000120"/> than anything else prepared him for his
                  humiliation, and which I repeat, because it is the only witty retort I had ever
                  known the doctor to make in time, as he was usually late in condensing his wisdom
                  for a retort.</p>
               <p>Rosamond had been in the city shopping, and, as she was gazing at a pyramid of
                  silks and laces, the doctor approached her, unperceived, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Won't you let me select the fashions for you, Miss Rosamond?"</p>
               <p>"No, doctor, I have a woman's weakness for pleasing myself; unless you are willing
                  to pay for them," she replied, in the easy, careless way in which she usually
                  bandied words with him.</p>
               <p>"And I have a man's dislike to paying for any woman's millinery except a wife's;
                  so you know on what conditions I will pay the bills," he replied.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, doctor; I will consider your reasonable conditions, but to-day I will
                  enjoy the privilege of choosing and paying according to my own taste and
                  ability."</p>
               <p>The silly fellow considered his escape a narrow one, and went away thankful that
                  she had not said yes at once; and determined he would not risk his liberty by
                  giving her another opportunity of catching him up at his word.</p>
               <p>Of course I could not recommend Paris to him after this evidence that the sight of
                  fineries and fashion did not render women oblivious of intrigue and husbandry, and
                  I took up a paper to see what steamers were advertised to sail.</p>
               <p>The Aspinwall steamers were the first on the column, and I told him how scarce
                  women were in California.</p>
               <p>His reading was not very general; the classics at college, with a few books for
                  recreation, among which Burns' Poems and a History of Witchcraft in New England
                  seemed to leave the most lasting impression; and his travels were not worth
                  speaking of; so he submitted himself to my guidance.</p>
               <p>I could see that, instead of being a "blighted" man by being "jilted" and
                  "rejected," he had gained more energy, and I at once put him in the way of
                  securing a passage and making his preparations while the steamer was awaiting the
                  appointed day.</p>
               <p>The evening was pleasantly spent, and when the doctor was bidding me farewell he
                  declared that he had never before understood me, and that henceforth he would
                  count me as the only friend he had; in fact, that we would throw all old rivalry
                  "to the winds, as the witch threw the tail of Tam O'Shanter's mare," and a new
                  feeling of friendship would "spring up, like a phœnix, from the ashes of the
                  past."</p>
               <p>I was amused at his conceit of being a former rival, and promised that when Mr.
                  Davenport died he should be welcome to renew his old flirtation without the fear
                  of incurring my enmity; but he<pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC6133-00000121"/>
                  protested that Rosamond had taught him a lesson which he would never forget.</p>
               <p>The passage was secured, and the doctor returned from New York to put his house in
                  order before his departure.</p>
               <p>He did not go near the house, however, but sent instructions to a servant, who had
                  what things he wanted to take with him packed up and sent to him, while he made
                  arrangements with his attorney.</p>
               <p>He spent every evening with me while waiting for the day of sailing, and I found
                  him to be what I had supposed him to be when my opportunities for Judging him were
                  less,—a good natured, indolent man, perhaps injured by fortune, which had smiled
                  upon him from his birth, and never gave him a good opportunity of developing those
                  traits of character which self-dependence alone can bring out.</p>
               <p>When bidding me a final farewell, he voluntarily promised to write to me, but on
                  condition that I would not tell Rosamond where he had gone to, for he said that he
                  did not wish the woman before whom his pride had fallen to know where he breathed,
                  or remember how near she was to having him. I was surprised that he did not add,
                  he was afraid she might repent of her cruelty, and seek to draw him back to the
                  heart which had spurned his love.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
               <p>I HAVE made no account of years, months, or seasons in this story, may be because
                  I wished to keep my ladies as young as possible; for, having dealt impartially
                  with their characters, I ought to atone, in a measure, by letting them remain as
                  young as I found them. I would still continue this policy, only I think that
                  ladies can be interesting after they are twenty, and remain unmarried; though Miss
                  Rosy had repeatedly decided to the contrary. But I have not consulted them with
                  reference to the characters, and I suppose I need not with regard to the ages I
                  have given them, unless I take the ungallant position that the sex are more
                  particular in concealing their years than their tempers and follies, which Heaven
                  forbid that I would or could.</p>
               <p>Eighteen months had elapsed since I first met Lucy; thirteen since the family
                  moved out on the farm; ten since Mr. Davenport had married Sarah; seven since
                  Robert's departure for South America, and five since the hegira of Dr. Leander
                  Boynton; but yet time had taken nothing from the bloom and freshness of my female
                  friends.</p>
               <p>Robert was a merchant, for he had made a few shipments of merchandise; and, though
                  his profits<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC6133-00000122"/> on them had not been great,
                  yet they had been sufficient to encourage him to try again.</p>
               <p>I went out to the farm occasionally, and was, by this time, welcomed as if nothing
                  had ever happened to mar the harmony of old feelings; for things flowed on there
                  nearly as smoothly as ever, owing to the exercise of good sense by all
                  parties.</p>
               <p>One morning, as the mail was brought in by my friend who was so much interested in
                  the "Rustic S" letters, he held up a diminutive note for me, and begged that I
                  would cut out the monogram for him. I looked at it, and the little knowledge I had
                  of Rosamond's handwriting, together with the monogram of her name, enabled me to
                  guess who the sender was.</p>
               <p>I did not waste time in surmising what its contents might be; but, after looking a
                  moment at the superscription, I opened it to see to what strange incident I was
                  indebted for her correspondence.</p>
               <p>I was horror-stricken by the intelligence the few lines contained. Three nights
                  before, there had been a collision between two large river steamers crowded with
                  passengers, and both had been burned to the water's edge.</p>
               <p>Those who had friends on them were filled with the direst alarm; for, while the
                  loss of life was said to have been fearful, no one could give any information of
                  the number or the names of the rescued, and all feared the worst for their own
                  friends.</p>
               <p>Lucy was among the passengers. By what accident she, who had never before left
                  home, was there, Rosamond did not wait to write me; but the boat she was on was
                  particularly unfortunate in the loss of her passengers. The letter was dated the
                  evening before, and I knew that Rosamond expected me every moment since then; so,
                  after explaining the reason for absenting myself, I hurried to the hotel at which
                  Rosamond was awaiting me, to give her any aid in my power.</p>
               <p>I met her, looking deathly pale, and almost frenzied by fear and impatience; for
                  she had not slept all night, nor eaten anything since she had left home.</p>
               <p>A few hurried words explained all she knew: her uncle's widow had started for the
                  North, and, being taken very ill at Louisville, telegraphed to Rosamond to come to
                  her.</p>
               <p>Rosamond had typhoid fever at the time, and, to keep her from attempting to go,
                  Lucy volunteered to take her place.</p>
               <p>With the few instructions she could get to travel with, she proceeded on her
                  journey, telegraphing her safe arrival at Pittsburg and Cincinnati, and mentioning
                  the name of the boat on which she was to go down to Louisville that evening.</p>
               <p>Prostrated and almost helpless as Rosamond had been, when Mrs. Davenport told her
                  about the accident, the shock gave her power to act, and, with the will and energy
                  of her character, she came to the city to obtain such intelligence as she could by
                  telegraphing to her aunt.</p>
               <p>Nothing could be learned, and she asked for my<pb n="244-245"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000123"/> escort to the place of the disaster, for Mr.
                  Davenport in his feeble state could not be of any service, and the news of the
                  accident was kept from his ears by his wife and niece.</p>
               <p>I tried to persuade Rosamond to remain at the hotel and let me go alone, as I
                  thought the journey, in her present state of health, would be suicidal; but she
                  was resolute, and insisted that she could bear it.</p>
               <p>Her self control and resolution were wonderful, for her grief was intense, and yet
                  she made no display of it.</p>
               <p>She was morally certain that Lucy was lost, and looked upon herself as blamable
                  for it in letting her take her place.</p>
               <p>We went on the first train going West, and, while my anxiety for Lucy's safety was
                  as deep as if she had been my betrothed, my concern for my companion was not a bit
                  less.</p>
               <p>But she held up under sickness, fatigue, and grief with wonderful fortitude, and
                  she reached Cincinnati not much worse than when we set out.</p>
               <p>There was a boat going down the river to the wreck, crowded with anxious friends
                  looking for the missing, and it was then I had a good opportunity of comparing
                  Rosamond in sorrow with the seemingly careless and impulsive girl I had known in
                  joy and sunshine.</p>
               <p>While others were loudly lamenting and bewailing their lost or imperiled friends,
                  she sat calmly by my side, tormented alike by pain and anxiety, but needing none
                  of the efforts and entreaty which were required to keep others of her sex within
                  the bounds of sanity and discretion.</p>
               <p>If pride could be justified under such circumstances, I would be proud of the
                  martyr-like spirit exhibited by the woman I had with me; and this, together with
                  the way she had rid herself of the doctor the moment he presumed too much on her
                  good nature, made her, in my estimation, worthy of even Robert's love and
                  confidence.</p>
               <p>I caught myself several times, even in the midst of the distress and excitement
                  which surrounded me, thinking that if Lucy was lost, her secret would be safe with
                  me; and however much Robert and Rosamond would mourn her untimely end, it would be
                  only as for a flower that had perfumed their path; and, little dreaming that the
                  sweetness of her heart had been crushed out between them, they would live and love
                  as well without her, scarcely affected by her tragic fate.</p>
               <p>There is something so ineffably touching in the thought of young love like hers
                  going unrewarded, unspoken, and unsuspected to the grave,—the true, warm heart
                  mingling with the cold, unfeeling clay,—that friendship and romance demand a
                  sacrifice or a monument to it, and, as I had no hope of dying of a broken heart, I
                  sat planning my life for a monument, while supporting Rosamond, there being no one
                  more bounden, since I had discovered her secret, and sought her love for
                  myself.</p>
               <p>But the idea of living to the memory of the<pb n="246-247"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000124"/> dead is premature, there being as yet no evidence
                  that Lucy was dead. Every one who had friends on the steamers were fearing the
                  worst, and mourning them as lost, and yet it was reported that more than half were
                  saved.</p>
               <p>We arrived at the place of the accident towards evening, and representing
                  Rosamond's condition to the captain of the boat I secured a state room for her use
                  during the night, while I hurried among the houses and barns on the shore where
                  the rescued were sheltered and those of the corpses which had been found were
                  collected.</p>
               <p>I had great difficulty in persuading Rosamond to comply with this arrangement, and
                  would not have succeeded at all only I represented to her that she would delay my
                  search, and that by leaving her in possession of the state-room we would have it
                  for Lucy's use, in case she was found injured.</p>
               <p>I was forced to promise her solemnly that I would return the moment I had found
                  Lucy or learned any tidings of her, whether I was able to bring Lucy with me or
                  not.</p>
               <p>The replies to my inquiries on the shore were even more discouraging than the
                  accounts in the city. There were a great many women among the passengers, and the
                  few men on board had all they could do in assisting those of their own party,
                  which left many others, who were traveling under no one's especial care, without
                  other resource than their strength and presence of mind. The lost were mostly of
                  the latter class, therefore, and as I visited the houses and barns without success
                  I became almost as hopeless as Rosamond.</p>
               <p>After a few hours' search I returned to the boat, fearing to leave Rosamond alone
                  too long, and the only comfort I could offer to the poor girl was that several
                  were reported to have wandered back from the shore for food and clothing, as the
                  supply, as well as the shelter, was limited in the immediate vicinity of the
                  wrecks.</p>
               <p>This was but a slender hope for either of us to hang to, as it was evident that
                  the ladies did not belong to this class of unfortunates. I persuaded her to take
                  some wine to sustain her, and had one of the physicians put laudanum enough in it
                  to secure her a night's repose, while I went on shore to assist in the further
                  search for the bodies of the lost.</p>
               <p>Morning brought no comfort to us; none of those who had been in the interior had
                  heard of any lady passengers being there, none that were on the boat could
                  remember having seen one of Lucy's description on it, and none of the bodies which
                  had been recovered could be identified as hers.</p>
               <p>As the boat we came down in was returning that day, and, I could not persuade
                  Rosamond to return with it and await me in Cincinnati, I had her transferred to
                  another boat, just arrived; and then I searched the country all around, going
                  every place to which I had learned women had been taken.</p>
               <p>There was now no use in hoping against hope,<pb n="248-249"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000125"/> and I was compelled to confess as much to Rosamond;
                  it would be foolish to try to conceal the fact from her and keep her longer in
                  suspense.</p>
               <p>They were clearing out the wrecks as fast as they could, and every hour
                  discovering the remains of some unfortunate, many of them so charred that it was
                  impossible to identify them. At last it was reported that a female form had been
                  taken out which might possibly be recognized by her friends, and hurrying to the
                  spot I found my worst fears realized.</p>
               <p>The whole scene was a sickening one, and the account of it cannot be otherwise, so
                  I will hurry through it as fast as possible, by merely stating that there was
                  nothing by which the poor victim could be identified save some of the golden
                  braids, which even the pitiless flames passed lightly over, while they ravaged
                  everything else.</p>
               <p>Youth and beauty, form and flesh, were marred and shrunken, and even the hair
                  would have been entirely destroyed, but that in falling, the back of her head came
                  in contact with something that extinguished or smothered the fire upon it.</p>
               <p>I told Rosamond, and, much against my wishes, she insisted upon viewing the body;
                  but there was no scene, for she calmly pronounced it Lucy's remains, and we took
                  them with us to Cincinnati that night.</p>
               <p>There was never before in my experience anything more difficult for me to realize
                  than that the young, beautiful, and pure minded friend, who a few weeks before had
                  promised me a sister's interest, had left behind to us only the poor blackened
                  corpse we had with us in place of herself.</p>
               <p>It was, and is yet, a wonder to me that Rosamond could have survived the fatigue
                  and shock of the adventure, considering the state of her health when she set out
                  from home; and I believe if it had been any other woman of my acquaintance who had
                  undergone her trials, I would have returned with two corpses instead of one.</p>
               <p>She bore up bravely under all, displaying more strength than could be expected,
                  even under more favorable circumstances.</p>
               <p>Nay, more: believing that I, as Lucy's lover, needed comfort, the generous girl
                  was as cheerful as she could be, and expressed many a sympathetic hope, looking to
                  a blissful meeting and immortality beyond the grave.</p>
               <p>This, too, from one who had hitherto borne a reputation for thoughtlessness, as
                  far as the future life was concerned; but from this time a change had marked her
                  character, deep, silent, and progressive. How to break the intelligence to Mr.
                  Davenport was a question we were at some concern about; for we feared it might
                  result in instant death to him, as his dependence on Lucy's care was returning
                  fast, and it was only his benevolence and hospitality that made him consent to let
                  her undertake the journey, and become a nurse to the invalid who had attempted to
                  come North to visit them.</p>
               <p>A suitable coffin was procured, and I telegraphed<pb n="250-251"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000126"/> to Mrs. Davenport that Lucy was dead, and her
                  remains recovered.</p>
               <p>The relics of our friend were in due time conveyed to the village nearest to the
                  farm, and prepared for interment; but Mr. Davenport was not yet informed of the
                  disaster.</p>
               <p>Sarah met us, with true sorrow expressed in her face, and said she could recognize
                  the corpse very easily; though we could not have done so if the hair had not been
                  preserved, since all else was sadly charred.</p>
               <p>"We are glad you can," said Rosamond, "for all we can identify her by is her hair,
                  and maybe her father would never be satisfied with such a recognition."</p>
               <p>"Everything seems natural to me," said Sarah, laying her fingers on the parted
                  lips and looking at her teeth; "there certainly can be no doubt."</p>
               <p>We assented to what she said, and she continued to reassure us. Then she
                  observed,—</p>
               <p>"You know how sensitive Mr. Davenport is of any blot or deformity in what he sees;
                  his nature revolts at it, and his art has strengthened the feeling until it is
                  almost a disease with him; and if we tell him how disfigured she was, it will be
                  adding fire to his torment,—he was always so proud of her beauty. I think,
                  therefore, we had better say nothing about the burning; drowning will not be
                  nearly so revolting to him, as he has often said drowning was the easiest way of
                  dying; and there will be no deception used, as the poor girl was both burned and
                  drowned. Besides, no doubt of her identity will exist in his mind, as there might
                  if we told him how little of her former beauty was left to establish it."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it would be better to bury an empty coffin than leave room for a doubt; he
                  will sooner become reconciled to it as a certainty; and, even if we could not
                  positively affirm that we have the right body, we are certain that she was not
                  rescued, and must, therefore, be lost," I said, in reply.</p>
               <p>Sarah, who had been freely weeping all this time, cast a look of appreciation upon
                  me, and then said,—</p>
               <p>"I will now leave you to proceed with the burial, and return, lest he should miss
                  me, as I left him asleep. He has been asking for you all the time, Rosy, and I
                  have been obliged to tell him that you could not come down-stairs yet. Oh, dear,
                  what shall we do at last, when the whole truth must be told to him?"</p>
               <p>Though Milton says,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Neither man nor angel can discern</l>
                        <l>Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks</l>
                        <l>Invisible, except to God alone,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> I fancied then that I could discern it both in Sarah's tears and in her last
                  piteous exclamations. Whether the great author is right or wrong, he is not
                  consistent; for he makes Uriel soon discern hypocrisy in Satan's looks, and a
                  human being has not more art in dissembling than the author of the art itself.</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC6133-00000127"/>
               <p>As Sarah turned away, Rosamond took her farewell look at the remains, and
                  exclaimed, as she pressed her lips to those in the coffin,—</p>
               <p>"Farewell, poor Lucy! sweet, even in death, are the lips that have never spoken
                  guile or deceit in life! Of such are the angels in heaven; and may you
                     <emph>live</emph> with them, dear!" And then she turned from them and wept,
                  while the lid of the coffin was being fastened on.</p>
               <p>The very skies, bright as they were when we came to the village, became lowering
                  and overshadowed, and not a face among the villagers, few of whom had seen much of
                  her, that was not clouded with genuine sorrow.</p>
               <p>I have not attended many funerals in my time; but I know there are few as solemn
                  and impressive as this one was, otherwise our race would care less for earth and
                  its pomps, and think more of the bright world beyond it.</p>
               <p>As the minister, in his prayer, said, "We now commit the body Thou hast given her
                  to its native earth, to await the sound of the trumpet that shall awake it, and
                  unite it with the soul and with Thee, in never-fading beauty, and everlasting
                  life, through Christ, its Redeemer, amen!" it seemed to me that the trumpet would
                  sound at once; that now, on the spot, the end of time had come, and, before the
                  coffin could be lowered, she would rise from it in the beauty of a celestial body
                  and the triumph of immortality.</p>
               <p>While they were singing the requiem in the simplicity plicity of true grief around
                  the grave, I still waited, expecting to hear the sound, while the tears fell fast
                  from my eyes.</p>
               <p>"Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be
                  changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
                  trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be
                  changed."</p>
               <p>Every word of the promise of the great doctrine of the resurrection of the body
                  was in my mind at the time, waiting for fulfillment; every comma and semicolon in
                  the sentence was visible to my mind, and I waited to see Lucy's new body, to feel
                  the vital fluid of immortal life course through my own sluggish veins, and to
                  claim her again for my sister in heaven.</p>
               <p>The hymn was sung, the earth was thrown on the coffin, the grave was filled up,
                  and I did not arouse from my trance, but, unconscious that the service was over
                  and the people had departed, I stood there blinded with tears, until the
                  fellow-mourner who leaned on my arm said to me, in sweet, sorrowful accents,— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"'Dust thou art, to dust returnest,</l>
                        <l>Was not spoken of the soul'"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Her comforting quotation had its effect on me, and I turned from my own thoughts
                  to her who was weaker in body but much stronger in spirit, and in hope, than I
                  was.</p>
               <p>We were driven to the house without delay,<pb n="254-255"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000128"/> Rosamond giving me one of the tresses she had cut
                  off before the coffin had been closed, and we were met by Mrs. Davenport at the
                  door, who told us that Mr. Davenport had been awake for nearly an hour, and
                  suspected the whole thing, because of some uneasy dreams which he had.</p>
               <p>He heard the sound of our voices, and called aloud for us to come to him.</p>
               <p>There was no way of delaying the dreaded moment, or avoiding it, and we went to
                  him, pale and terrified enough to convince him that his fears were true.</p>
               <p>"Rosy, what have you done with Lucy? Where have you laid my darling, for I know
                  she is dead? Oh, my darling! My darling, beautiful Lucy!"</p>
               <p>"Oh, uncle! Will you forgive me?" was all she could say, and she fell forward
                  against his bed, prostrated at last by grief and exhaustion.</p>
               <p>"I know you have buried her,—I saw it all! Oh, my child! my beautiful, loving
                  child! There is no more wealth on earth for me now without her! God help me now,
                  and God forgive the wrong I have done her!" he cried.</p>
               <p>There was not a dry cheek in the room as he continued to bewail the loss of his
                  idol, and no one could say one word to console him; for words, in his state of
                  mind, would be little better than a mockery.</p>
               <p>At last he cried out,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, speak to me, some one! Sarah, Rosy, Edward Pearson, what did she say? Did she
                  forgive me? What message has she left for me, my angel? It is no use to hide
                  anything from me! I know you have buried her, for I saw the grave open and her
                  coffin let into it!"</p>
               <p>"This is all: the steamboat sunk with her; and would to God that I, rather, had
                  sunk with it, and died for her, uncle!" cried Rosamond, drawing one of the golden
                  braids from her bosom.</p>
               <p>"My darling! my darling! this is all that is left of so much perfection!—this
                  poor, cold, clammy lock,—beautiful in death, like herself!" he exclaimed, pressing
                  it to his lips, and taking no further notice of what Rosamond had said.</p>
               <p>The lock was dry and warm, but the coldness and glue were on his lips, and he
                  stroked it and kissed it, as if to bring the gloss of life back to it.</p>
               <p>Suddenly he was taken with a spasmodic breathing, and, looking defiantly at his
                  wife, he exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"My child has been always a dutiful one; she has never, by word, thought, or act,
                  given me cause for offense; and I believe she never would, had God spared her and
                  me for twenty-one years longer."</p>
               <p>He turned to me, as if expecting me to confirm his words; and, understanding the
                  language of his expression, I did so; for I thought he was dying, and did not then
                  care how much suspicion my words would cast upon Sarah.</p>
               <p>Gradually he became calmer, and stroking the hair seemed to soothe him.</p>
               <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC6133-00000129"/>
               <p>"How beautiful, my poor darling! just the color and texture of an angel's," he
                  cried, and his hand stole over Rosamond's head, which was buried in the
                  bedclothes, and he blessed her for preserving the hair for him, and paying the
                  last duty to his lost darling.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
               <p>IT is time to follow Robert now in his search for fortune, and show how he
                  prospered in it, as well as how his correspondence with Rosamond, from which he
                  had hoped for so much, turned out. It seemed impossible that when he was absent I
                  could have thoughts or events to sustain the story, considering that he is its
                  hero; but, alas! how easily the best of men can be spared from their places, and
                  when they leave the world, it goes on just as well without them, as if they never
                  had anything to do with its progress.</p>
               <p>Sometimes there is a convulsive shock given to its motion, and things seem to halt
                  in a limited area, when a champion of liberty, progressiveness, or humanity is
                  suddenly lost, as at the time the tidings of Abraham Lincoln's assassination was
                  flashed over our land. But even that is local and brief, for next day everything
                  proceeds as usual; and, with new leaders, we quietly and steadily resume our
                  onward march.</p>
               <p>I wrote to Robert, and received letters from him by every mail; and, as I had
                  promised, kept him posted on the markets, while he bought and shipped, as he was
                  encouraged by his success. He was, also, up to the events of the last chapter,
                     in<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC6133-00000130"/> correspondence with Lucy, who
                  wrote him all the home news that could amuse and interest him; and every letter
                  she sent him filled his heart with joy, as it was long, earnest, and
                  affectionate.</p>
               <p>With Rosamond he was not so happy in his correspondence; there was something
                  unsatisfactory in her letters, that made them as much a mystery as herself was
                  sometimes to him.</p>
               <p>He waited impatiently for each one, hoping it would not prove like the previous
                  letters; but, after he had got it, there was some undefinable wish that it had
                  sunk in the ocean before it had reached him, as the anticipation was pleasanter
                  than the letter itself.</p>
               <p>One paragraph, and sometimes one clause, would seem to contradict the preceding
                  one, as if she was trying to say more than she felt, or else she was afraid to say
                  all.</p>
               <p>He weighed every sentence, and examined every thought with distrust and eagerness,
                  as if it had been written by a diplomatist, and contained more or less meaning
                  than was apparent to the eye or could be understood in the common sense.</p>
               <p>Her caution was both amusing and provoking to him; for neither his nor her name
                  was inside of the envelope,—"Dear Friend" being used to designate her lover, and
                  "R" standing, like a solitary sentinel, for herself.</p>
               <p>He remembered her repeated ridicule of the insufferable conceit of some men, who
                  were afraid to be gallant, or even polite, to a marriageable woman, lest she was
                  waiting to pounce upon some incautious expression and distort it into a promise,
                  of even Pickwickian mildness, for legal arbitration; but now she was taken in the
                  same cautionary conduct herself, and, whatever her tongue might confess, though
                  she had been non-committal enough with that, her pen would never prove anything
                  against her.</p>
               <p>Was she engaged to him or was she not, in the spirit of their agreement? he asked
                  himself to determine from her letters; but they would not be evidence, and he
                  tried to countermine the strategic coquetry he suspected them of covering by
                  writing formal business-letters, hoping that she would become solicitous by his
                  apparent coldness, and write more affectionately, to reclaim her power and her
                  place in his heart.</p>
               <p>He delayed writing longer than usual, wrote a shorter letter than was customary
                  with him, and, from beginning to end, not a word was admitted which might not have
                  been written by a dry senior in a mercantile house to the foreign partner in
                  China.</p>
               <p>Without telling her whether he was sick or sound, warm or cold, or sad or cheerful
                  near the equator, he merely reported the success of some operations on their joint
                  account, and discussed the prospect of following them with others equally, if not
                  more, profitable.</p>
               <p>Then followed a few paragraphs on the probabilities of the markets in the United
                  States advancing<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC6133-00000131"/> vancing or declining
                  while the merchandise was on the way, the rates of exchange, marine insurance,
                  freight, and duty, and the comparative merits of steam and sail-tonnage.</p>
               <p>As he put his most formal and imposing signature to this, he felt that he had
                  already achieved a decided success, and he waited to triumph over his superior
                  skill and tact.</p>
               <p>He left Rosamond's tact and penetration out of mind, however; for he was writing
                  to no silly, love-sick schoolgirl; but to a girl with a shrewd, quite intellect,
                  who at once comprehended his tactics, and had wit and spirit enough to appreciate
                  them, and give him an opportunity of proving their merits.</p>
               <p>To match his letter, Rosamond took a large sheet of blue commercial, and then got
                  a copy of the "Economist," which she searched for terms and mercantile lore wholly
                  unknown to her before, not withstanding her taste for speculation and finance; and
                  then, lest she should expose herself to his criticism by getting the technical
                  terms in the wrong place, she copied sentences whole, where they were most knotty
                  and terse.</p>
               <p>In this way she prepared a long and intelligible business-letter, which thoroughly
                  informed him of the state of the markets, besides containing a short article on
                  Peruvian bark; which she digested, and then reproduced in her own words for his
                  consideration.</p>
               <p>It was like most business-letters, condensed at the expense of grammar; the
                  pronoun "I" was wholly ignored, and was signed "Rosamond Heywood," in full, as
                  boldly as the character of the letter could authorize her.</p>
               <p>It was evident that Robert, who was longing for a few words of affection, was not
                  the iron will destined to crush the sweetness out of her; and when he read the
                  letter he had misgivings to that effect. He was, however, pleased with it,—she
                  evidently understood why he wrote to her with so much formality, and fell in with
                  his vein readily enough to please him; and he thought, with pride and
                  satisfaction, of the patient research and exhaustive labor it must have cost her
                  to collect and compose its matter, while he laughed at her ambition to be
                  conqueror, and at her success in shaping her phrases into the most unexceptionable
                  business parlance.</p>
               <p>It did not require a strain of his imagination to see her as she contemplated her
                  letter for the last time before sealing it; her bright eyes sparkling with
                  pleasure as she carefully read her squarely written lines, and her face flushed
                  and smiling as she pronounced aloud, to her own satisfaction, words which she
                  thought would puzzle him.</p>
               <p>He could imagine her coquettish glee as she thought he would grow more amazed at
                  every sentence, and impatient as he searched in vain for one line which even the
                  most subtle sophist could twist into an expression of tenderness or interest.</p>
               <p>It was not long before this that my letter, giving him a lengthy, and perhaps
                  exaggerated, account<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC6133-00000132"/> of Dr. Boynton's
                  rejection had put him in a good humor with her, and he then thought she was his
                  own betrothed without doubt; so now he was prepared to look upon anything in her
                  handwriting with rapturous eyes, and the effect of this letter on the whole was
                  only to prove that she was clever at anything she undertook, and never wanting
                  words or thoughts to meet any exigency, with the wit and promptness so
                  characteristic of herself.</p>
               <p>The maiden's hand, which is kept for a man to the exclusion of other suitors,
                  ought to do everything well in the eyes of her lover, especially when one of those
                  suitors had all that a woman could ask for, except brains.</p>
               <p>The doctor had as much of what is desirable in a husband as usually falls to the
                  portion of one man, and few women would have rejected him when there was not a
                  formal engagement to warrant them in such a refusal.</p>
               <p>Robert was, however, determined not to let Rosamond conquer, as it would be a bad
                  precedent for their married life; and be continued to write his business-letters,
                  hoping that she would get tried of them and show some signs of relenting.</p>
               <p>The same determination seemed to have possessed her mind, however, only as she
                  exhausted her stock of mercantile terms by sending them off too prodigally at
                  first, her letters gradually became shorter, until at length she could say no more
                  in a business way than could be put into a few sentences.</p>
               <p>Robert could endure it no longer. Her letters would chill the ardor of any lover;
                  for, full of eager expectation, he would open a sheet of "commercial note," to
                  find only a few words written on the middle of the first page.</p>
               <p>At last his indignation overflowed upon getting one so unprecedently brief that he
                  acknowledged it as a telegram, and even then told her that she had not availed
                  herself of her privilege, as ten words were allowed in a regulation message. He
                  concluded by remarking that ideas must be worth more now than when she and he had
                  spent so many pleasant hours roaming over the hills together, or else her time
                  must be more profitably employed, since she could not spare more of either in
                  writing to an old friend.</p>
               <p>The note was begun more formally than he was able to conclude it, for he addressed
                  her as "madam," and to this she took exception, but wrote in reply a much longer
                  letter than any written during the three previous months.</p>
               <p>She hoped he would forgive her for correcting him, but he had made a serious
                  mistake in conferring the title of "madam" upon her, an honor which belonged
                  exclusively to married and elderly ladies, and as she did not belong to either
                  class, her honesty and modesty shrunk from accepting it before time had thrust it
                  upon her, which would be quite as soon as she wished for it.</p>
               <p>This was exactly what Robert had expected. He knew that addressing young ladies as
                     "madam"<pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC6133-00000133"/> was unusual, and changing
                  his mode of addressing her would arouse her curiosity and lead her to question
                  both his motives and his correctness in so doing.</p>
               <p>It was not according to Rosamond's notions of etiquette or usage to "madam" a lady
                  before she had entered the state of matrimony, and she would combat its propriety
                  with all her heart, while he knew that he could quote authority for its
                  correctness, and at the same time acquit himself of any desire of depreciating her
                  youth or respectability.</p>
               <p>Before he had written the letter, he had been looking over the "Bride of
                  Lammermoor," in which the young lord of Ravenswood is made to address Lucy Ashton
                  several times as "madam," and as it sounded odd and formal, coupled with a young
                  maid of seventeen, he rightly supposed that Rosamond would at once correct him if
                  he addressed her so, without suspecting the trap he was setting for her.</p>
               <p>What she hastily regarded as derogatory to her reputation for youth, could be
                  easily proved to be both proper and complimentary after she had been drawn into an
                  argument, by advancing her favorite author for authority, and showing that it had
                  been used by the passionate young Ravenswood in addressing a girl of Lucy Ashton's
                  age, character, and condition.</p>
               <p>He replied that he was led into the error, if such it was, by her favorite
                  novelist, a much better authority than himself, and therefore he ought to be
                  excused for doing what so responsible a <emph>historian</emph> permitted to be
                  done between parties whose honor and respectability on the one hand, and youth and
                  virtue on the other, have never been called in question.</p>
               <p>He well knew that she would turn to Scott at once, and discover that in that
                  interview between Ravenswood and Lucy Ashton, the lover was indignant at what he
                  considered the falseness of the maiden whom he so formally addressed, which would
                  lead Rosamond to discover her own delinquency, if she had not thought of it
                  seriously before.</p>
               <p>She appeared to be satisfied that he was right, however, using her woman's
                  privilege of not being expected to confess it; and whether she took the hint that
                  he considered himself ill treated or not, she discontinued the correspondence
                  altogether.</p>
               <p>He only heard of her through Lucy or through me; for she sent many friendly
                  messages to him through the former, and he continued as before shipping and
                  trading to get fortune enough to enable him to marry, however much he felt
                  discouraged by the discontinuance of her letters.</p>
               <p>But at last one steamer arrived in South America without a letter from Lucy in its
                  mail-bags, and that same steamer brought him letters from Rosamond and myself,
                  announcing the sad loss of his best correspondent.</p>
               <p>There was no more speculation; the fortune he thought necessary to possess before
                  he married<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC6133-00000134"/> was not won; yet he no
                  longer sought it, but came home in the first steamer.</p>
               <p>The correspondence which he had fondly hoped would have opened Rosamond's heart to
                  him, and wean her from her habit of bandying complimentary phrases with him, was
                  therefore a failure. She had not written one word expressive of love, she had not
                  permitted him to feel that his motives in going to South America in search of
                  wealth were different from those of other adventures, and if she had betrayed a
                  deep interest in his success, she was careful to deny other motives than those of
                  a friend, and a partner in his speculations.</p>
               <p>If the girl had a heart at all, it was so incrusted by caution and coquetry that
                  it could not be reached.</p>
               <p>Her father, who had been a judge, would doubtless be proud of her tact and
                  craftiness had he lived; but a lover is not a lawyer, and cannot appreciate the
                  skill and diplomacy Rosamond had shown.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
               <p>ROBERT surprised me one day, after dinner, by presenting himself before me with a
                  luxuriant growth of beard on his bronzed face. I knew that he had not realized a
                  fortune by the few turns he had made with his little capital, and yet he had
                  encouragement enough to have continued his operations, so earnestly and
                  auspiciously begun.</p>
               <p>A few hurried words explained his reasons for coming back so unexpectedly when he
                  was apparently prospering; and a new subject for thought was opened to me.</p>
               <p>It seemed strange that a man who went to a foreign country to win wealth for one
                  woman, should be so deeply affected by the death of another that his purpose was
                  abandoned, and he returned as far from the realization of his hopes as he was when
                  he went away. Such, however, was the case with him, for the death of Lucy broke
                  down his speculative spirit as completely as if it had been for her that he went
                  to make the fortune.</p>
               <p>She might have been as dear to him as a sister; but it is only in isolated cases
                  that even a sister's death will make a man forget his duty to his future wife.</p>
               <p>Had he not been Rosamond's lover in his own<pb n="268-269"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000135"/> estimation, and also in the estimation of others, I
                  should have supposed that he and Lucy had loved each other, and that it was for
                  her sake he had left his home; for the first words he uttered, after he had taken
                  my hand, and controlled his emotions enough to speak, were,—</p>
               <p>"So Lucy is no more!"</p>
               <p>The utter misery that was concentrated in these five words brought the tears to my
                  eyes, and, comparing his despair with what I had seen Lucy betray the day I was
                  refused by her, I saw at once the mistake Robert had made, and the sad result of
                  it.</p>
               <p>The artist's daughter, who needed no other wealth than that which usually fell to
                  the lot of artists, was the most fitting wife for him; she was the one he loved in
                  the deep, quiet way which her character inspired, and his fancy for Rosamond was
                  all forced by the novelty of her return to Mr. Davenport's, the excitement of
                  their rivalry in wit, and their flirtations with each other.</p>
               <p>Sarah had monopolized his attentions before Lucy had grown up, and he had never
                  questioned his feelings towards the latter, because he was always near her, and
                  the tenor of their intercourse had been so free and even that nothing had
                  interfered to mark the period when they had ceased to love as children and became
                  mature lovers.</p>
               <p>When Rosamond amused him, after her return, and I had expressed my preference for
                  Lucy, he set her apart for me in his mind, mistaking my admiration ration for
                  love, and his love for Platonic friendship.</p>
               <p>The same friendly misunderstanding misled me, too; for I thought he loved Rosamond
                  from the moment she had returned, and, looking upon Lucy as my legitimate prize, I
                  constituted myself her lover until her answer discovered my mistake.</p>
               <p>We walked over to his old rooms, and then down to the house Mr. Davenport lived in
                  when I first knew him; but the pleasant evening, with the gay scenes it presents
                  in city life, and the familiar looks of our favorite streets and buildings, had no
                  interest for him; we could think of nothing, and therefore speak of nothing, but
                  only of her who was now no more, and the graces and qualities which had charmed us
                  both.</p>
               <p>There seemed to be an endless list of them, for we never before had time to
                  recount them all; greater ones had obscured the minor from our vision when they
                  shone in her life; but now, in the gloom of the grave, we could see them all, and
                  beauties of every degree filled our view.</p>
               <p>He said nothing of his feelings towards Rosamond, nor spoke of her, except in
                  connection with the death and burial of her cousin, and yet her did not suspect
                  the inconsistency of losing so much interest in the one he professed to love.</p>
               <p>He left the city next morning for the farm, having first shaved off his beard, to
                  make himself as presentable as possible after his rough life in the southern
                  latitudes.</p>
               <pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC6133-00000136"/>
               <p>Rosamond was the first one whom he met as he entered the theater of so many joyful
                  and homelike scenes, and, with infectious tears in her eyes, she welcomed him
                  home.</p>
               <p>There was simply a warm clasp of the hand, and a few hurried inquiries and answers
                  in regard to each other's welfare, and then Rosamond left him to inform Mr.
                  Davenport of his arrival and prepare him for the surprise.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenport never knew why Robert went to South America. He was aware that he
                  intended buying merchandise there, and becoming, in some measure, a merchant; but
                  he thought that trading was only an auxiliary to painting, and that Robert, with
                  Church's famous painting of the "Heart of the Andes" in his mind, wanted to study
                  tropical scenery in emulation of that great and adventurous landscape painter.</p>
               <p>He gave Robert a tremulous welcome,—perhaps as a father would welcome back his
                  only remaining child, after having seen his favorite ones laid in the grave.</p>
               <p>He spoke of Lucy at once; in fact, he spoke of her several times every day since
                  she had been buried,—sometimes as if she was alive yet, and always as if she was
                  still watching by his beside.</p>
               <p>"I am sorry Lucy is not here to welcome you, Robert. She was always the first to
                  hear your step on the stairs, in Summer Street, and meet you at the library door,
                  and give you a welcome. But we have had sad times since then, Robert, and we all
                  will never meet there again. Family scenes and fireside enjoyments are always
                  changing: the same persons, the same words and diversions, are seldom reproduced
                  in the evening entertainments of our lives; new thoughts and scenes are always
                  coming up, and old joys and faces are always falling off.</p>
               <p>"Lucy has gone from earthly scenes, Robert,—gone in person; but I sometimes feel
                  that her spiritual presence is near my bed; she was faithful in life, and can be
                  more so in death. See, here is one of her tresses, braided as on the morning she
                  left us! It has never been unwound; but all I can do will not bring back the rich
                  gloss it had when alive. Do you not perceive the change?" he said, rapidly.</p>
               <p>Robert took it, and acknowledged that it had faded and lost some of its sheen and
                  beauty already. Artists could discern shades better than Rosamond and I could; for
                  we thought it was as bright and glossy as ever, and the change existed only in Mr.
                  Davenport's imagination; for he complained when Rosamond gave it to him, and
                  before it had time to fade.</p>
               <p>"Some day when I am able to go out we will go to her resting-place together; she
                  will not be disturbed because we tread near her; and when I die, then lay me down
                  beside her."</p>
               <p>All were affected, as well as Robert, and in a few moments Mr. Davenport seemed to
                  forget that she was no more, and continued,—</p>
               <pb n="272-273" xml:id="VAC6133-00000137"/>
               <p>"Lucy does not think that portrait like her,—it is so feminine to demur; to be
                  sure, artists cannot make canvas look as soft and delicate as the human skin, and
                  oils will not make the eyes look as clear and bright as the moisture which Nature
                  supplies. We are at best but poor imitators of her; for she is jealous of her
                  works, and will not supply any other artist with the material to rival or compete
                  with her in the sublime and beautiful.</p>
               <p>"But I think I have done all art can do in that picture; and if I ever allowed
                  that it did not do Lucy justice, it was because I had to acknowledge that Natural
                  was a greater artist than myself."</p>
               <p>He talked on, as he always did when he had any one to listen to him, often
                  seemingly very egotistical, but always mild and entertaining.</p>
               <p>When Robert was left alone with him he was asked to repeat the solemn assurance of
                  Lucy's innocence of any intention of deserting him; and when it was reiterated, he
                  expressed his sorrow for having ever listened to anything that wronged her, even
                  in thought.</p>
               <p>"Next to Lucy I have injured Edward Pearson, by my suspicions, and I shall tell
                  him so when I see him again; I tell Lucy so every day, dear angel, and I know that
                  she forgives me," he said.</p>
               <p>That night, after supper, Robert walked toward the graveyard, in which Lucy had
                  been interred. Rosamond had offered to go with him and show him the grave, but he
                  said he could easily find it; for he naturally wished to have no witness to his
                  emotions when he stood by her grave the first time.</p>
               <p>There would be no sweeter place on earth than this country cemetery to rest in, if
                  the bloom and beauty of the turf above them could touch the dead senses of those
                  sleeping there. It was a level tract of land; but so tastefully planted with trees
                  and rose-bushes, that it looked like a sheltered nook, intended by nature to
                  reconcile the village mortals to their final sleep when the work of life was
                  done.</p>
               <p>One monument alone towered above all the head-stones; it had been raised by the
                  people of the village in memory of a former pastor; and one person besides himself
                  appeared seeking communion with the spirits of the departed, when Robert walked
                  among the graves.</p>
               <p>It was the window of the pastor who slept beneath the monument, and Robert went to
                  her to inquire for Lucy's grave.</p>
               <p>As the old lady saluted him, he said,—</p>
               <p>"I have never seen a more lovely spot than this is; it is very creditable to the
                  village to have the resting-place of its dead so tastefully kept."</p>
               <p>"Ah, yes; it used to be well kept, but it has been much neglected lately," she
                  replied, with a sigh, as she looked upon her own unsatisfactory efforts to make
                  her husband's grave look as well as she longed to see it. The good soul used to
                  think it fair and beautiful until her own dead was laid<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000138"/> there; but since then it had not been to her taste
                  at all.</p>
               <p>After he had patiently listened to her account of her husband's sickness, death,
                  and burial, together with such reminiscences of his life as a pastor's wife likes
                  to dwell upon most, he inquired for the grave that held Lucy's disfigured remains,
                  and left the widow to go mourn by it.</p>
               <p>It may be well to remark here, that Robert did not yet doubt his love for
                  Rosamond; for he was only conscious that his sorrow for Lucy's death had blunted
                  all other feelings for the present, and had made him indifferent to the pleasures
                  and aspirations of this world in a great measure. He was too observant of his own
                  thoughts and feelings not to be aware that his engagement with Rosamond was almost
                  forgotten, like a dream, in the great and ever-present reality that his dearest
                  friend was no more; and he suspected that his love for the living ought not to be
                  overshadowed by his grief for the dead. But he did not, however, think that he had
                  deceived his own heart entirely; for he believed that the feelings with which he
                  left home would return after the expiration of time, and it was only proper now,
                  when death had loosed a silver cord, and broken a golden bowl, that his mind
                  should be turned away from earthly cares and ambition.</p>
               <p>Love was, according to his idea, a sudden passion, like that which Sarah had
                  inspired when she attacked him with the bloom and coquetry of eighteen years; or
                  like that which he felt when Rosy Heywood had returned a full-grown, frank woman
                  of twenty; and he did not dream that it could grow with his body and mind, as
                  quietly and slowly as either.</p>
               <p>He did not enter into a metaphysical inquiry of the nature and extent of his loss:
                  deep and sincere grief seldom does; he was merely conscious that Lucy was a loss,
                  without asking his heart what part of its affections belonged to the dead, and
                  what part could be satisfied by the living.</p>
               <p>He sat down by the grave, hardly able to realize that the eye that used to kindle
                  with his, and the hand that used to be clasped in his when as children they
                  sauntered along the gay streets of the city, were now cold in death, and that he
                  could be so near the lips which had never spoken a peevish or fretful word, and
                  receive no welcome from them.</p>
               <p>Tears fell thick and warm from his eyes, and he laid his head down on the cold
                  mound and mourned on it as he wished to do when he left the house alone.</p>
               <p>He finally fell asleep, and in his dream something like a Jacob's ladder presented
                  itself for his comfort. Lucy stood beside him and talked over their youthful joys
                  and affection, and promised to come back often to him if he did not forget
                  her.</p>
               <p>It stormed all that night after he had returned home, and his dream, together with
                  the wind and rain, kept him awake until daylight. It seemed impossible that she
                  could be insensible to the cold<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC6133-00000139"/> and
                  loneliness of the tomb, and several times he had so nearly lost his reason that he
                  thought of getting up and going to take her out of it, as he repeated, over and
                  over again, Moore's lines on the Dismal Swamp: <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"They made her a grave too cold and damp</l>
                        <l>For a soul so warm and true."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Next morning he devoted to Rosamond, for he had not yet said half a dozen words to
                  her in private, and he thought she had a claim on his confidence which his grief
                  ought not to let him forget.</p>
               <p>Their joint ventures had been reasonably successful, and though he had their
                  marriage in mind as a matter of course, he had no longer any cares about the
                  fortune he once had thought so necessary before asking her to marry him.</p>
               <p>He had proved to his own satisfaction that he could make money as fast as he
                  wanted it, and he was less solicitous of the future now, since Lucy's death had
                  taught him the uncertainty of life, and the vanity of being too much concerned for
                  its wants.</p>
               <p>He told Rosamond he was sorry that their correspondence had not continued long
                  enough to keep her advised of all the investments she had an interest in, after he
                  had announced the result of his trading.</p>
               <p>Then there was a slight recrimination; each one blaming the other for the
                  unfortunate issue of the correspondence from which so much was hoped, but from
                  which so little was gained.</p>
               <p>At last Robert held out his hand to her, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Come, Rosy, let us forget this childishness, and be good friends, as we always
                  have been."</p>
               <p>He meant the childishness of quarreling, but she thought he had reference to the
                  childishness of sentimentality; because, when she had boasted that her letters
                  were good business-letters, he told her she might have known that he expected a
                  different class of letters from her; so she said as she placed her hand in his,
                  and blushed with pleasure and satisfaction at his proposal,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, with all my heart, Bob; it is time we should know our minds and our duties
                  better; we are old enough to lay aside childish things now: I shall soon be
                  twenty-two, and I am sorry to think that I have never yet done anything worthy of
                  a woman."</p>
               <p>He clasped her hand firmly in his, and then pressing it to his heart in a
                  caressing manner, he said,—</p>
               <p>"Little things should not ruffle the tempers of such large children, or interfere
                  with our long and pleasant friendship for each other; for we have given each other
                  almost an unlimited power over our future happiness: you know, Rosy, that I am not
                  to get married without your consent, and that you have agreed to give it whenever
                  I am ready; no matter upon whom I may fix my choice."</p>
               <pb n="278-279" xml:id="VAC6133-00000140"/>
               <p>A shade of disappointment passed over her countenance as she saw she had mistaken
                  his meaning, and she became uneasy and nervous, her hand anxiously seeking her
                  pocket; but the leaven of Mother Eve was still working in her, and putting on her
                  old coquettishness of manner, she said,—</p>
               <p>"Why, Bob, what an incongruity! How could you be dependent on <emph>my
                     consent</emph> if I was bound to approve of <emph>your choice?</emph> What a
                  silly country lass I would be if I thought that I had gained any power over your
                  future happiness by such a one-sided bargain as that is! You forget that I am a
                  shrewd business woman, and can see at once that such a piece of cajolery is no
                  agreement at all, and deserves no more than a laugh from the sharp traders
                     <emph>we</emph> have been."</p>
               <p>"Incongruity, cajolery, or by whatever term you choose to designate a fair
                  bargain, those were the words. I have thought of them too often to forget them,
                  Rosy, and repeated them over in my mind too many times to be mistaken in the form
                  and purport of our agreement. And at the time we made it neither of us thought it
                  one-sided, for we both gave a full and free consent to it."</p>
               <p>Her apparent coquetry made him slightly angry, and very earnest; and there was a
                  quivering of the muscles around her mouth as she answered him,—</p>
               <p>"Bob, you said, just now, that we ought to put away childishness, and become
                  mature, sensible friends. Let us do that, and let our past foolishness ness be
                  forgotten, and with it this subject, and bargain, if you wish to call it
                  such."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and I say so still. Let us, as sensible people, talk plainly, and make plans
                  for our future happiness; but we must begin by showing we can keep our words with
                  each other. I will keep mine, and I shall hold you to yours, unless you break it
                  in spite of me," he said, becoming more persisting by her apparent desire to avoid
                  the subject.</p>
               <p>There was an expression of pain on her face, but she quickly pressed her lips
                  firmly together, and became very pale, and then, after a moment, she covered all
                  her emotions over with her old look of impervious coquettishness, and
                  replied,—</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I will stand by it; though I would much rather you would be your own
                  counselor in the affair, as the happiness or misery of your choice will be yours
                  alone."</p>
               <p>"Is our friendship for each other, then, so light and insincere that our
                  matrimonial relations will not affect each other? If so, Rosy, the spirit and
                  intent of our agreement was not understood, at least by you," he said,
                  reproachfully.</p>
               <p>"Oh, no; I hope not, Bob! I should be unspeakably sorry to see you marry a wife
                  unworthy of you, and I made this agreement with you because I thought you would
                  first give me an opportunity of knowing her, and discovering the faults she could
                  easily conceal from you until after you had married her. But I suppose you thought
                  yourself capable of judging. Some dark-eyed<pb n="280-281"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000141"/> beauty of South America you have bespoken, and as I
                  must give my consent blind folded, it is only right that I should wish to throw
                  all the responsibility upon yourself," she quickly returned, with more of her old
                  character aroused in her than she had shown since the death of Lucy.</p>
               <p>Robert was blind during air this conversation, or he could have seen that she was
                  no longer coquetting with him; but he was only the more determined to bring the
                  issue about by her apparent wish to avoid it. He said,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, to be sure I will abide the consequences of my rashness. Only give me a
                  'blindfolded consent,' for she will not marry me without it."</p>
               <p>"First, then, show me her picture or her letters, that I may judge whether I am
                  about to do you good or harm," she cried, with a strong effort to maintain the
                  composure and cheerfulness of her expression.</p>
               <p>"Oh, hang her letters, Rosy! they were unworthy of her. Mere anonymous sheets of
                  note paper, neither signed nor addressed as if she had confidence in my honor, but
                  feared that I might make an improper use of them; and doubtful of myself, since
                  one who ought to know me well doubted me, I have burned the miserable apologies
                  for love-letters which she sent me," he cried, becoming impatient at the mention
                  of her letters.</p>
               <p>Hearing her letters spoken of so disrespectfully nerved her for the ordeal, and
                  she calmly said,—</p>
               <p>"How ungallant of you! Were they written in Spanish or Portuguese?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, never mind the letters! Her picture is over here, and after we look at it,
                  then let her tongue speak for herself," he said, putting his arm around her and
                  drawing her towards the mantel-glass at the other side of the room.</p>
               <p>He flattered himself, poor fellow, that she was waiting for him, and, little heart
                  as he had for following her teasing and evasive humor, the fate of Dr. Boynton was
                  in his mind, and he thought there ought to be no more room for her wit and
                  coquetry to deny their relations to each other.</p>
               <p>There was no longer a way to avoid what she dreaded; she saw her own self
                  reflected in the glass; she knew that the question of her engagement with him must
                  be decided now; and, quickly freeing herself from his arm, she drew back, blushing
                  and agitated.</p>
               <p>"Come, Rosy! there is no longer any use or chance for prevarication; you have too
                  much wit and intelligence to be ignorant of whom I had reference to that day, and
                  now let us have no more ambiguity about it. Of you I thought then, and have ever
                  since, and it has never occurred to me that I would have to ask your consent to my
                  marriage with any other woman; and though I longed to see you the frank, generous,
                  and true girl I knew you to be, I have suffered whatever your coquettish humor
                  chose to make me, rather than ask you to bind yourself so long before I could
                  afford to marry.<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC6133-00000142"/> But now, though I am
                  not much better off, I have no longer such extreme desires, and I know you do not
                  care for wealth or magnificence; so let us understand each other: will you be
                  frank, Rosy?"</p>
               <p>There was never upon woman a more frank and earnest look than Rosamond wore then;
                  her hand did not seek to free itself from his, but her other hand stole up until
                  it rested upon his shoulder, and, looking blushingly and candidly into his face,
                  she said, kindly but firmly,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, Robert, I will! Let us remain as we always have been, true, firm friends: we
                  have need of each other, and may be able to help each other. I have no friend in
                  this world that I can look to for advice besides yourself, and, if you will let
                  me, I shall try to be good to you whenever Providence puts it in my power. This is
                  all we were ever intended to be."</p>
               <p>She never before looked more charming; the mourning dress she wore contrasted well
                  with the whiteness of what little of her neck it left exposed, and its loose fit
                  draped her fine form like a beautiful statue.</p>
               <p>Robert understood her in a moment, and, dropping her hand, he tore himself away,
                  and threw himself into a chair, exclaiming, almost angrily,—</p>
               <p>"I thought we understood each other better than that, Rosy, or I would never have
                  flattered myself that we were intended to be something more than we have always
                  been."</p>
               <p>"I have never intended to deceive you, Robert; whatever I have said to give you
                  hope was said in the thoughtlessness of the moment, and I always supposed that you
                  thought as lightly of it," she replied, feelingly, and looking apologetically at
                  him.</p>
               <p>"No, Rosy, I deceived myself; like the fool in the Bible, I have flattered myself
                  until my iniquity has become hateful to me;" and then, before Rosamond could
                  interpose a word, he added, rising from the chair, "Let us bid each other adieu
                  here. I will then see Mr. Davenport and go back to South America: I longed to see
                  poor Lucy's grave; and now, having remembered all her goodness, and mourned for
                  its departure from this dreary world, I shall bid a long farewell to this once
                  pleasant place."</p>
               <p>She folded her arms across her breast, and steadfastly refused to shake hands with
                  him, saying, with sudden alarm and eagerness,—</p>
               <p>"No, Robert, you must not go away; we will never be happy without you here; and
                  besides, you would soon sicken and die in that hot, unhealthy climate."</p>
               <p>"Come, Rosy, let us shake hands. There is nothing here or elsewhere that my
                  absence or presence will affect, and I suppose I shall never trouble you again
                  this side of the grave. Will you give me your hand?"</p>
               <p>"No, Robert; Bob dear, I will not! for you must not leave us and go back there:
                  stay here with or near us, and you will be much happier. You said a moment ago
                  that you did not care for wealth, and I know one living cares less for it<pb
                     n="284-285" xml:id="VAC6133-00000143"/> than you do; so there is no reason why
                  you should forsake painting for traffic."</p>
               <p>"You are right; I do not nor never did care for it for myself; and I only sought
                  it because I wanted it for you; but there is excitement in the pursuit of it that
                  may help me for the present. What is there here? Lucy is dead, and you—well, I
                  never understood you as I should——"</p>
               <p>She refused still to take the hand he held out to her, and, seizing his hat, he
                  went towards the door saying,—</p>
               <p>"Well, then, I will go without it"</p>
               <p>She sprang ahead of him, however; closing the door, she placed her back against
                  it, and said,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, Robert, forgive me if I have ever led you to sacrifice your tastes and
                  pursuits for me! I never thought of it before; and whatever I have said, I would
                  not wish to see you anything else but what you are. If I loved you, I would love
                  you as the artist, and nothing else; I would love the profession for the man, and
                  not the man for the profession. I shall never be happy if you go back to that
                  place again wrangling for dollars, instead of staying home here and enjoying your
                  friends and your tastes."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, love me, and love the artist, and I will stay here in our own
                  country," he said.</p>
               <p>"Yes, as a friend and sister, <emph>for ever and ever;</emph> but I could not
                  otherwise, Robert; I would if I could; but I have not power over my own heart" she
                  cried.</p>
               <p>"That is enough, Rosy; let us part before I make myself despicable by asking you a
                  third time. I have been all my life jumping to conclusions, and it is time I
                  should learn wisdom somewhere," he said, impatiently, trying to remove her from
                  the door.</p>
               <p>But she stood firm, and, winding both her arms around his neck, entreated him with
                  tears.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Robert dear, forgive me if I have wronged you! You know that, however wayward
                  and thoughtless I have been all my past life, I would never be false to a friend;
                  and whatever I said to you, and allowed you to say to me, was not for unkind
                  intentions towards you, but because I did not know my own heart.</p>
               <p>"Let the past be buried; that question of giving my consent to your marriage be
                  forgotten, and then we can be happy again.</p>
               <p>"If you go away, Robert, I shall die of grief, for I have already been the
                  innocent cause of Lucy's death; and now, driving away the only comfort her father
                  can have in his utter helplessness and woe, will take away what little hope there
                  is in me of ever doing any good."</p>
               <p>"Remember how much we both owe him, Robert, and how much he now stands in need of
                  anything we can do to add to his comfort and consolation. When our own flesh and
                  blood failed us, and were cold towards us, he took us under his care,—poor little
                  lambs, without a shepherd or a dam,—and defended us from the preying wolves that
                  beset us on every side. Now, when he has lost his<pb n="286-287"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000144"/> only child, and has no friends besides us, can we
                  turn our backs on him and leave him, when we might be children to him, and pay him
                  back some of the debt we owe? What is the fame of gaining wealth or excelling in
                  art, Robert, compared with some noble purpose in life, as that of living for some
                  one else's comfort and good, especially when that person is one to whom every
                  human and divine law binds us? And then, again, Robert, Lucy loved you; she lived
                  loving you, and died loving you, all in secret, though I know it; and, if she
                  lived, you would some time be Uncle Davenport's son in another sense. But now,
                  when God has taken her away from her father, you will not make his affliction
                  greater by deserting him too, instead of trying to make it lighter the short time
                  he has left to mourn over her?"</p>
               <p>It must not be supposed that Robert stood unmoved while Rosamond was saying all
                  this, for the poor girl was crying almost aloud all the while, and her broken
                  sentences were often intermingled with kisses on Robert's forehead and cheeks,
                  while she appealed to him, so that her feelings would have overcome his obstinacy
                  without the powerful ally she awoke in his own heart by appealing to his gratitude
                  to Mr. Davenport.</p>
               <p>He had softened at once, and wept with her at her picture of Mr. Davenport's
                  desolation; but the moment she said that Lucy had loved him, he staggered back to
                  the chair, and, overcome by emotion, he wept like a child, crying,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, Lucy, my love! my love! had I ever suspected your love, and known my own
                  heart, life might have been happier to me and longer to you! Oh, my poor Lucy! my
                  love! my love!"</p>
               <p>Without raising his head, he held out his hand to Rosamond, who was at once by his
                  side with her sympathy, and he said,—</p>
               <p>"Rosy dear, forgive me, though I cannot forgive myself. This has been all a
                  hallucination. I know now what love is,—I never knew before,—and I feel my very
                  heart turning to clay and mingling in the grave with the ashes of the poor
                  unfortunate girl.</p>
               <p>"How could I have made such a mistake, Rosy? Talking to you of love, and angry
                  with you for not returning it, when my heart has been wholly another's! Alas, this
                  is what comes of human planning! I thought you ought to be mine, and Lucy Ned
                  Pearson's, and never for once waited to learn how much true love had to say. Will
                  you forgive me, though my presumption and foolishness seem too great to be
                  overlooked by any one but a good and generous girl like yourself?"</p>
               <p>Rosamond assured him there was nothing to be forgiven; and then, hand clasped in
                  hand, they promised to remain in the old house while Mr. Davenport lived, and be
                  his son and daughter in spirit and truth.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
               <p>WE will now resume our search for Lucy,—not in the grave, nor yet in heaven, dear
                  reader; so do not be startled by the proposition. We will return to the Ohio River
                  and land in Kentucky.</p>
               <p>Yes, to Kentucky Lucy was taken, alive and sound, by the current of the
                  stream,—far, far below where I had sought her before.</p>
               <p>I do not know how I have kept the secret so long; and now, as it leaps from my
                  heart, my hand and pen are electrified by writing it; but I try to tell my story
                  as it ought to be told,—every event, error, and surprise in the order they
                  happened. Do not, therefore, think me hard-hearted for causing you to shed tears
                  at her grave, and recording the solemnities of her funeral, and the grief of her
                  friends. All was real to us then. We mourned for her as lost. And remember that if
                  you have been deceived for a few hours, so had we been for a few months. To
                  resume, then.</p>
               <p>Lucy went on board the steamboat at Cincinnati, as her telegram to Rosamond
                  announced, and she passed through the horrible scenes of the collision. She had
                  not been long in her state-room when it occurred, having been sitting up until
                  near midnight conversing with a lady and gentleman, with whom she had traveled
                  from Pittsburg. It was the first night she had ever spent on the water, and the
                  unusual sounds and motion kept her awake.</p>
               <p>Before she felt the shock of the collision she heard the cry of alarm from the
                  deck-hands, and she was upon her feet when the passengers were awakened to a sense
                  of their danger by the crash. As the cry of fire from the boiler-deck mingled with
                  the screams of terror from the saloons and state-rooms, the first feeling of cold
                  horror she had ever known chilled her blood. But Lucy was a calm, brave girl by
                  nature, and her presence of mind did not desert her. Though she was not as
                  energetic and self-reliant as Rosamond, she could think and act with as much
                  reason and judgment.</p>
               <p>When she first went into her state-room, she saw the life-preservers hanging up
                  there; and, reading the notices for the passengers' instruction as to their use,
                  she fitted one on her, partly from curiosity, and partly from prudence.</p>
               <p>Looking into the saloon, as soon as the alarm was raised, she saw several running
                  wildly about, and the smoke and flames already rushing up from the lower deck; so
                  she stepped back and tied the cork jacket on her, as she had done more leisurely
                  only a few hours before. Then she came out again, and followed the crowd of
                  frightened passengers to the cabin-guards, from where she could see another
                  steamboat in flames also, and, by the red glare it cast, she recognized the couple
                  she had been a short time before conversing with. They appeared calm,<pb
                     n="290-291" xml:id="VAC6133-00000146"/> and she looked to see what they were
                  doing for their safety, so as to do the same for herself; and having observed the
                  gentleman take the doors of his room off their hinges, she proceeded to unhang
                  hers also.</p>
               <p>Her calmness attracted the attention of the man, and he took it off for her,
                  showing her how to hold and use it when she plunged into the water; also telling
                  her to stand near them, and not jump until they did, as the steamboat was nearing
                  the shore, and, by jumping off the moment it was sinking, she would save herself
                  with less effort.</p>
               <p>"You may be engulfed for a moment by the plunge, but hold on to your door, as you
                  have it now, and it will bring you up again all right," he said, to reassure her,
                  as he pitied her lonely condition; for he was only a bridegroom yet, and had not
                  lost his gallantry.</p>
               <p>Others now crowded the guards around her, uttering frantic cries, and, as they
                  could not be restrained from throwing themselves into the water, the philanthropic
                  man handed them doors and tied life-preservers on them, as he had opportunity,
                  turning, every few moments, to his wife, for she seemed as impatient to get off
                  the burning boat as some of the most excited were. There were six or eight persons
                  restrained by his efforts from throwing themselves into the water without the
                  necessary apparatus for keeping afloat, and, while he was preparing them for the
                  awful leap, the boat was rapidly burning and filling.</p>
               <p>At last she was settling in the water, and, giving a hand to his wife and another
                  to Lucy, he told them to jump off with him.</p>
               <p>Lucy took the leap, but the other lady did not, and while her husband went back to
                  take her off', the current carried Lucy away from the vicinity of the vessel.</p>
               <p>As swimming-schools for young ladies were not among our city institutions when
                  Lucy was receiving her education, she had not been taught to swim, and having no
                  means of directing her course to the shore, she was carried down the river with
                  the current. The life-preserver and the door were sufficient to keep her afloat,
                  however, and, thankful for her escape from the fire, she awaited rescue patiently,
                  though every moment was drifting her away from the light of the burning vessels,
                  and into the unknown darkness beyond her.</p>
               <p>All night long she drifted down the river, chilled by the coldness of the water,
                  but still clinging to her door, and trusting in Providence for deliverance.
                  Towards daylight she was carried so near the Kentucky shore that her feet touched
                  the sandy bottom, and letting go her hold on her good friend, the state-room door,
                  she crept to the shore.</p>
               <p>The firmness and endurance which had so far supported her failed the moment she
                  was out of the water, and she sank down on the low bank in a swoon.</p>
               <p>About sunrise one of the wretched, poverty-stricken inhabitants, who exist rather
                  than live<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC6133-00000147"/> among the many wealthy and
                  refined people in Kentucky, came down to look at his fish-lines, and gazed with
                  open-mouthed wonder upon the unknown waif which night had cast upon his
                  fishing-bank. He soon found that she was not dead, as he at first supposed, and,
                  going to his wife, got her advice and assistance, and removed Lucy to his
                  log-hut.</p>
               <p>It was long before she revived, and when she did, her exhausted state would not
                  permit her to give any account of herself, which, indeed, was unnecessary, as the
                  couple would scarcely comprehend any account she could give them.</p>
               <p>Then followed a fever, which nothing but divine interposition prevented from
                  ending her life, for she had no medical aid, and as little of the aid which diet
                  and comfort can give as she could expect from South Sea Islanders.</p>
               <p>The people among whom she suffered lived in utter ignorance of almost everything:
                  they never read a newspaper, and never knew what was transpiring beyond the range
                  of their eyes; and they did not, therefore, think of making any inquiries as to
                  whom the invalid belonged.</p>
               <p>They had not heard of the accident which had cast her upon their poor hospitality,
                  nor did they ever miss the ill-fated steamboats from among the many which passed
                  up and down the river every day; and they did not consider that anxious friends
                  might be looking for her, or that by hailing a passing boat she might be sent to
                  some place where better care could be bestowed upon her.</p>
               <p>Days and even weeks she was prostrated, insensible of her condition, or else too
                  weak and unnerved to make any exertions towards helping herself.</p>
               <p>At last she asked them for some paper and ink, that she might write home and
                  inform her father of her safety; but they had none, and before any could be
                  procured she had a relapse.</p>
               <p>When the man at length made a journey to a distant grocery store, or rather to a
                  groggery, at which paper was kept, he got some, and told them of the strange guest
                  he had; but what aid or thought could be expected from people as degraded as they
                  were? They were of a class so depraved in their tastes and morals that they
                  thought Providence gave them corn and peach crops for the sole purpose of
                  supplying them with whisky and brandy, and that the little used as bread and fruit
                  was diverted from its legitimate channel, and wasted.</p>
               <p>It was long before Lucy was able to write the few lines necessary to inform her
                  father or Rosamond of her safety, and then those lines were carried about in the
                  greasy pockets of her host some time longer before they were mailed.</p>
               <p>Before I bring Lucy back to her friends, however, I must say something in
                  extenuation of the three credible witnesses who saw her coffined and buried.
                  People are not believed when they say, after an unexpected event has transpired,
                  that they<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC6133-00000148"/> were looking for it, and yet
                  doubtless such is often the case. We are so constituted that we hope and doubt
                  everything sometimes; the evidence of our senses does not preclude it, and when
                  occasionally one of the vagaries of our mental eccentricity becomes a sober fact,
                  we boast of it, while we forget the many others that were dissolved to nothing. I
                  went out to the farm two or three times while Lucy was absent,—in her grave we
                  supposed,—and every time I approached the house it was with a vague hope that her
                  death and burial were all a dream. Sometimes I would hope to learn on arriving
                  there that something more had been heard of her fate, certain as it seemed to me,
                  and even that I would meet herself at the door, in perfect health and soundness,
                  laughing at our blunder.</p>
               <p>"What if her death proved to be a mistake, and she was at the house before me,
                  alive and well; would we not have a happy time of it? And how we should laugh at
                  the tears we shed over her supposed corpse!" were words which often rose to my
                  lips, but were choked back as foolishness.</p>
               <p>Yet in sober mind (if I may so designate it in contradistinction to the whimsical
                  fancies which will sometimes fill its place) I never doubted her fate, nor did I
                  doubt that we had recovered the right body, though I thought with so little to
                  recognize it, a mistake would be possible.</p>
               <p>Since the error has been discovered, I have learned from Rosamond that she doubted
                  nearly as much as I did; but the philosophy that Sarah urged appeared sound, and
                  she therefore kept her doubts to herself.</p>
               <p>For Sarah I cannot speak so positively, because she pretended to recognize more
                  than we did, while our eyes were as good as hers, and our acquaintance with Lucy
                  as thorough.</p>
               <p>Yet she wept the tears of a mourner, and whatever she thought and felt in her
                  heart, her face did not betray any doubts of the identity of the corpse or
                  pleasure in the sad calamity that had befallen us all, though it might be her
                  gain.</p>
               <p>It was her policy to have no doubt of Lucy's death, as Mr. Davenport would cling
                  to a hope, however improbable, and die with it, leaving a provision in his will
                  for the return of his daughter, which might hamper the independence of the young
                  widow.</p>
               <p>The lines written in the log-house down on the banks of the Ohio River were
                  brought to the farm at last. The letter was addressed to Rosamond, and as soon as
                  it was placed in her hand she thought the superscription looked somewhat like
                  Lucy's,—in fact, she suspected that it was her writing; but, like Paul, she was in
                  doubt whether it was written in the flesh or out of the flesh. It was torn open in
                  an instant, and, without waiting to read the contents, she looked at the
                  signature, and screamed that Lucy was living, at the same time rushing into
                  Sarah's arms, who was coming towards her, when she saw Lucy's name.</p>
               <p>She left the letter with Sarah, and ran as fast as<pb n="296-297"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000149"/> her supple limbs could serve her to Mr. Davenport's
                  room, crying,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, uncle, good news! good news! Lucy is not dead! she is alive! Lucy is living!
                  Lucy! Lucy! she is alive!"</p>
               <p>"What do you say, child? Lucy alive! My angel coming back to me!" he exclaimed,
                  starting up in his bed, and repeating Rosamond's assertions rather than
                  questioning them.</p>
               <p>"Yes! yes! she has written to me! she is somewhere; I did not wait to see. Sarah
                  has the letter!" And then they fell into each other's arms and wept like
                  children.</p>
               <p>Sarah followed Rosamond as soon as she had given the note a calm perusal, and read
                  it to them as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>"DEAR FATHER AND ROSY,—I was not lost with the boat, as I fear you have
                     believed, but was taken down the river a long distance by the current, and set
                     on shore by a merciful Providence.</p>
                  <p>"I have been very sick and weak ever since, and unable to recollect how I left
                     home or realize my present situation most of the time; but now I am getting
                     strong very rapidly, and will, with God's help, be able to go home to you soon.
                     When I reach home I will tell you all about my escape, and the fearful sights I
                     have witnessed."</p>
               </q>
               <p>Then followed words of gratitude to the people who had saved her life, an inquiry
                  for the lady on whose account she left home, and directions how to address a
                  letter to her.</p>
               <p>"Oh, God be praised for his mercy and goodness!" Mr. Davenport exclaimed, when his
                  wife had read to the place at which my quotation terminates. "I will get up and go
                  to her with Robert! Rosy dear, telegraph to Robert! The poor angel is alive! the
                  lost is found! I never did feel satisfied with that lock of hair you gave me; for
                  Lucy's was far more beautiful."</p>
               <p>They persuaded him with difficulty to rest in his bed until Robert came out from
                  the city, in order to preserve his strength for the journey; though neither Rosy
                  nor Mrs. Davenport believed it possible that he could undertake it.</p>
               <p>Robert went out that evening, and there was a family jubilee, an overflowing of
                  hearts into hearts, and an outpouring of thanks to the Providence which had
                  rescued and preserved Lucy.</p>
               <p>After all the tears shed for her, none could be found willing to acknowledge they
                  had ever been satisfied that we had buried her.</p>
               <p>Robert and Mr. Davenport, who had least reason to doubt it, because we who had
                  seen the corpse did not tell them that we had doubts, had repudiated the shade and
                  texture of the hair from the first; and now when it was known to be another's they
                  made their discrimination the theme of great boasting, though they had only said
                  it had faded or lost its gloss in the water.</p>
               <pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC6133-00000150"/>
               <p>"And now," said Mr. Davenport, pathetically, "let us remember that some poor
                  unfortunate has <q>
                     <l>'Gone to her death,'—</l>
                  </q> maybe some friendless young girl, going to the South to teach; and no one has
                  missed her! Oh, the poor victim! we must deck her grave always with flowers, and
                  weep anew for her as a poor friendless stranger. <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'Who was her father?</l>
                        <l>Who was her mother?</l>
                        <l>Had she a sister?</l>
                        <l>Had she a brother?</l>
                        <l>Or was there a nearer one</l>
                        <l>Still, and a dearer one</l>
                        <l>Yet, than all other?'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> are questions that may never be answered in this life; but we know that she
                  was <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>'Fashioned as slenderly,</l>
                        <l>Young and as fair'</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> as Lucy was, otherwise you would not have made that singular mistake."</p>
               <p>He continued his speech until he had quoted nearly all "The Bridge of Sighs" in
                  his lament over the unknown victim, and his desire to watch and honor her grave in
                  place of the friends who were not near it to do her memory that respect.</p>
               <p>By Robert he was persuaded to relinquish the thought of undertaking to travel, and
                  Rosamond and Robert were appointed to go for Lucy, and determine whether it would
                  be prudent to remove her at once or not.</p>
               <p>Before she retired that night, Rosamond packed a trunkful of clothes for Lucy, and
                  they left the farm, so as to take the morning train to the city, where they
                  delayed only long enough to purchase cordials and tonics to strengthen the invalid
                  for her journey home.</p>
               <p>They found her in the midst of squalidness and wretchedness greater than they had
                  ever imagined; but still, improved since she had written.</p>
               <p>In his impatience, Robert clasped her in his arms, with all the fervor and frenzy
                  of a lover, the moment he could reach her.</p>
               <p>As she did not suspect the feelings her supposed death had awoke from their
                  dormant state, she returned his embrace with all the warmth that could be expected
                  of a sister; but when, forgetting that Rosamond was also waiting to embrace her,
                  he still held her to his heart, crying, in the very words he used the day Rosamond
                  had told him he had been beloved of her, "Oh, Lucy, my love! my love! my darling!"
                  she comprehended at once the meaning of his unusual demonstrativeness.</p>
               <p>There was no resistance to his passionate joy; indeed, there was no power of
                  resistance that she could offer to it; for, though she did not become insensible,
                  the power of action and utterance seemed to be suspended; and, while her head lay,
                  like a drooping lily, upon his breast, the little color which<pb n="300-301"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000151"/> returning health and friends had brought back to
                  her face had faded away from it again, and left her so inanimate in appearance
                  that he feared she had fainted.</p>
               <p>It is men's misfortune to be the cause of ladies' swoons, and women's fortune to
                  supply the cure for them, and no sooner had Robert done the poor invalid this
                  damage than Rosamond pushed him aside, and tried her gentle arts in repairing
                  it.</p>
               <p>When Lucy revived again, and was told that her father was well, and could hardly
                  be persuaded from coming for her himself, she became very cheerful, and said she
                  felt able to go with them at once.</p>
               <p>As her accommodations were of the most beggarly description, and her mind seemed
                  elated at the prospect of going, both Robert and Rosamond agreed with her
                  desire.</p>
               <p>It was only a few hundred yards to the river, and the steamboats ran up to the
                  banks, where the water permitted, to take any passengers that signaled them.</p>
               <p>That same evening a passing boat touched the bank three hundred yards above the
                  bar Lucy had been cast on, and she was taken on board in almost an ecstatic state;
                  her body was already beginning to feel the sympathetic influence of the mind.</p>
               <p>They rested a day in Cincinnati, and then took passage on another boat to
                  Pittsburg, as that mode of conveyance was easier than railroad travel, and would
                  rest her for her greatest exertion,—the journey across Pennsylvania. But she was
                  so much stronger by the aid of cordials, milk-punch, and the society of old
                  friends, that when they reached Pittsburg, they had no fears for her, and leaning
                  on Robert's arm, she walked from the boat to a carriage almost as lightly as if
                  she had never been sick.</p>
               <p>She was allowed two days to cross Pennsylvania, and then rested another day in
                  Philadelphia, by command of her guardians, where I had the pleasure of welcoming
                  her back to life, and joining the party in their triumphal march to the farm.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenport was sitting up,—in fact, he had been for a full week, except during
                  the hours of night; and, being advised by telegraph when to expect her, he was at
                  the parlor window, looking down the avenue for her arrival.</p>
               <p>There was a joyous shout of welcome, as she came through the village, from those
                  who mourned her loss the day we pretended to bury her; and when we reached the
                  gate we could see Mr. Davenport's handkerchief wave from the window.</p>
               <p>She was in his arms almost in a moment after she alighted, and the fond old man
                  forgot all his ailments for the time being, and hugged her as soundly as he could
                  have done at any time in his past life.</p>
               <p>Sarah was not behind in her good will, but, true to her dignity and practical
                  sense, did not waste either tears or time in her welcome, but released her, and
                  went to see about suitable refreshments for us.</p>
               <pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC6133-00000152"/>
               <p>After another affectionate embrace, and then holding her out from him to make sure
                  that he was not wasting his strength on a counterfeit Lucy, he released her, and,
                  looking to us, cried,—</p>
               <p>"Edward and Rosamond, give me your hands! You are a nice pair of friends to
                  intrust with the burying of my dead! What can you say for yourselves for imposing
                  upon a sick old man with such a lachrymose tale and dewy ringlet as you brought
                  me, like the bloody garments Jacob's sons brought to him to prove that his beloved
                  Joseph was devoured? Guilt will not let you answer; but ask for my forgiveness and
                  you shall have it instantly."</p>
               <p>He was becoming intoxicated with joy, and in his overflow of happiness was
                  scarcely conscious of what he was doing.</p>
               <p>His cordial grasp of my hand conveyed to me the reparation he offered for his past
                  suspicions; and, letting Rosamond's hand fall, he reached for Lucy, his purpose so
                  evident in his countenance that all present read it in an instant.</p>
               <p>The poor man labored under the strange delusion under which myself and all the
                  family had labored (Lucy excepted), that she and I loved each other, and in the
                  wild impulse of the moment would have given her to me without letting me ask for
                  her. Robert's quick wit saved us from the embarrassment which would have followed
                  such an offer; for, grasping Lucy's hand, he cried, "You have found your lost one
                  again, and your dead is now alive, Mr. Davenport. Give her to me, and I shall
                  never let her go near a steamboat again!"</p>
               <p>He did not wait for an answer, but clasped Lucy to his heart as if she were
                  already his own, and drew her towards her father for the blessing.</p>
               <p>Amazement sobered Mr. Davenport in an instant; he was not expecting this, and both
                  he and Rosamond anxiously glanced at me to see how I took such an unlooked-for
                  interference; for Robert was the only one who knew that Lucy and I had parted as
                  brother and sister.</p>
               <p>My face assured them that there was nothing in my heart but unfeigned satisfaction
                  at the turn the little family drama had taken, and a bright flush of pleasure
                  illumed Rosamond's always bright countenance, while Mr. Davenport showed plainly
                  in his that though he would gladly have given her to me, I had lost none of his
                  good will by letting her go to another so cheerfully.</p>
               <p>He turned to Robert, who still held the half-resisting girl to his heart, and
                  said, in poorly counterfeited indignation,—</p>
               <p>"What, you selfish rascal! can you have the impudence of asking me to give my
                  long-lost darling away to you so soon after the grave has given her back to me?
                  No, sir, she shall never leave my house again for you or any one else! so
                  understand that I love her yet!"</p>
               <p>Robert did not hear or seem to hear what was said; for Lucy, overcome by the
                  excitement of the past few days and the vehemence of her lover,<pb n="304-305"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000153"/> would have fallen on the floor had he not supported
                  while he embraced her, and all his attention was centered on her.</p>
               <p>As she recovered, and was again showing some signs of resistance, her father
                  said,—</p>
               <p>"Bring her to me, Robert."</p>
               <p>Robert led her towards him, and, supporting himself between Rosamond and me, the
                  tender father stood and received them both into his embrace, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Yes, as God has given her back to me, so willingly do I give her to you, Robert,
                  my son! May you both be as good and as happy, as faithful to your God and to each
                  other, as it is in my overflowing heart to wish you!"</p>
               <p>Through the tears, which were flowing down his face, the benevolence and goodness
                  of his character shone with almost unearthly brightness, and he was, no doubt,
                  realizing the divine truth that "it is more blessed to give than to receive;" but
                  even in the excitement of the moment his native politeness was not forgotten, for
                  he said to Robert, who was still holding Lucy,—</p>
               <p>"Come, Robert, do not be selfish; remember we are all friends here, and allow Rosy
                  and Mr. Pearson to congratulate us. God be thanked, we have at last awakened from
                  this 'Midsummer-Night's Dream' by which I have been deluded so long."</p>
               <p>Rosamond kissed them both affectionately, and I followed by kissing Lucy also; but
                  Mr. Davenport port, overcome by his unusual excitement, and having deprived
                  himself of my support, fell to the floor.</p>
               <p>As we lifted him up, he cried, in a suffocating voice,—</p>
               <p>"Oh, I am dying! Come near me, my children! May God bless you both, and bless you
                  all, Rosy and Edward! You have all been good to me; what would my life have been
                  without you? Every one of you has contributed to my happiness as you had power,
                  and I bless you for it. My dying blessing——"</p>
               <p>While he was speaking, or rather gasping, those words, we laid him on a sofa, and
                  Mrs. Davenport, who was ignorant of all that had passed in the room, came in now
                  and hurried out again for restoratives.</p>
               <p>Though some were bathing his temples, and others chafing his hands, he was
                  gradually becoming incoherent in his speech, and we felt, with all our exertions,
                  how powerless human aid is when death comes upon man. We tried all that love for
                  the good man could do to assist him, but he was soon unconscious of our efforts
                  even, and talked wildly, while we could do nothing to restore him to

               <p>He ceased speaking. All his life seemed to have been reviewed in that short time,
                  and its principal events were recounted for the last time on earth.</p>
               <p>He soon sank into a peaceful slumber, and we sat up with him all night, expecting

               <p>About daylight he opened his eyes, beckoned for Lucy to approach him, and after
                  holding her to his breast for a few moments, without any other token of
                  recognition, he calmly expired.</p>
               <p>Lucy had hitherto shown all the firmness and presence of mind that she had
                  acquired by years of patient nursing; but the moment his breath ceased to be felt
                  on her cheeks, both failed her, and Rosamond and Robert took her away, while Sarah
                  and myself remained behind with all that was left of the artist, philanthropist,
                  and father, save the good record of his unobtrusive virtue and useful life.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
               <p>DURING the four weeks which followed Mr. Davenport's death, there was nothing said
                  or done at the farm worthy of record in this story. The mourning set aside by Mrs.
                  Davenport and Rosamond on the return of Lucy, had been resumed again, with a few
                  extras for the former, who now required a widow's weeds.</p>
               <p>It would be presumptuous of me to describe Sarah's feelings on finding herself a
                  free woman so soon; for she did not betray her sentiments to me when I was her
                  lover, and I was less still in her confidence since she became Mrs. Davenport. By
                  the death of her husband she was released from her servitude as nurse and
                  housekeeper, and also from the yoke of the law, so that she was now free to enter
                  into the matrimonial lists again, as soon and energetically as her sense of
                  propriety would let her.</p>
               <p>Born to succeed, apparently, and yet, so far, singularly unsuccessful, she must
                  have rejoiced, without malice towards the living or the dead, upon contemplating
                  another trial of her captivating powers, so long resting in ignoble idleness, but
                  still in good enough preservation to serve their ambitious mistress.</p>
               <pb n="308-309" xml:id="VAC6133-00000155"/>
               <p>She had made no pretensions to excessive grief, for moderation was her virtue; and
                  to be moderately bereaved, and decently solemn, was all she claimed as her
                  privilege. She had perception enough to know that tears would not become her,
                  however natural and honest the feelings which would call them forth, and her
                  respect for her cousins kept her silent on the subject of her loss. Since the day
                  she had entered the house as its mistress, she had never, by word or deed, given
                  Rosamond and Lucy cause for complaint, and she only waited to leave it now when
                  respect for them would permit it. Like all well-bred persons, she made her duty
                  and inclination go hand-in-hand; so her politeness to them was not lost, since she
                  needed a month of retirement to form and mature her plans for the future.</p>
               <p>Mr. Davenport's last will, which had been made about the time he began to have
                  doubts of his wife's disinterestedness in marrying him, had not been altered, on
                  account of Lucy's supposed death, and it left one-third of his property to his
                  wife and the balance to his daughter.</p>
               <p>During the earlier days of his professional career, he had been a successful
                  painter, and his savings were not inconsiderable; so that Sarah's portion, however
                  below her ambition, was enough to maintain her in modest independence.</p>
               <p>But she had higher projects than living a retired widow, and her fortune would not
                  serve her ends unless she spent it all in a year or two, and risked everything in
                  getting a husband with a more substantial fortune before it had failed her.</p>
               <p>She was too independent and too conscious of the incompatibility between herself
                  and Rosamond to remain with her cousins on the farm, even if her patience would
                  suffer her to await there a tardy and doubtful discovery, and she resolved to go
                  some place where she would be more appreciated, and courted as a woman.</p>
               <p>It was her belief that the sexes were intended to be nearly equal in numbers, and
                  statistics prove that they are nearly so by birth; but she knew, from personal
                  observation, that marriageable men were greatly in the minority in her
                  neighborhood, and, consequently, there was some place where they were wasting
                  their existence without the companionship Providence had provided for them.</p>
               <p>She gave her mind to the benevolent task of discovering that place, and the
                  project of blessing it with her presence and attractions.</p>
               <p>Rosamond, while frank in her manners, was as deep as a well, and, though Sarah had
                  not made her a confidante in her schemes, yet she rightly read them in her mind by
                  her knowledge of character in general, and of Cousin Sarah's in particular.</p>
               <p>Though sorrow-stricken by the death of a man who had been such a kind guardian to
                  her, Rosamond's mind was not vacant. Physical and mental activity was her
                  characteristic, and a feeling of moral responsibility added to these, had made her
                  a girl of nobler aims and aspirations than when she was<pb n="310-311"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000156"/> first introduced to the reader. It was only
                  natural, however, that some of the old leaven would some times show itself, and
                  this was usually the case when she was dealing with Sarah, whose selfishness and
                  cunning aroused it.</p>
               <p>One day, in conversation with the widow about some acquaintance who had married
                  above her deserts while on a long voyage, she said, "If ever a woman seems to be
                  angel to man it is when she is at sea, with the rough faces and the rougher
                  manners of the sailors to set off her beauty and gentleness. As she is the only
                  woman in sight, every look and motion seems grace itself; no feminine eye is there
                  to detect art and affectation; and no wonder the poor sailors and all the men on
                  board admire her as the only mark of civilization and refinement they have in
                  view."</p>
               <p>While Rosamond was delivering her mind of this sentiment, her hand was exploring
                  her pocket. It was not often drawn forth empty from that magazine of curiosities,
                  as when she sent Boynton away, and when she had concluded her speech she produced
                  a clipping, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Being at sea must be almost equal to living in California, which appears to be a
                  paradise for women, from the following paragraph I have cut out of a paper a few
                  days ago:</p>
               <p>"'We would advise some of our New England towns, which have an overstock of women
                  and an interest in philanthropic enterprises, to send a few cargoes of its
                  "wall-flowers" to California, where they would not be suffered to sit alone a
                  whole evening at a party, however much age and appearances were against them.</p>
               <p>"'From an exchange we learn that there was a ball given there some time ago, and
                  all the women they could muster amounted to two cooks, not over-beautiful or
                  accomplished, as may be supposed, but yet no Eastern belle could boast of being
                  more sought and contended for than they were in the mazy dance at that ball. This
                  reminds us that we saw some time ago in the same exchange a paragraph which
                  deserves notice also:</p>
               <p>"'A woman had taken her infant to the theater at San Francisco, and as the
                  orchestra began the overture the child cried; whereupon a man in the pit called
                  out to stop the fiddles and let the baby cry, as he had not heard one for ten
                  years.</p>
               <p>"'The orchestra stopped, and the baby continued its performance amid unbounded
                  enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>"'Let those societies whose object is to encourage marriage and population take
                  notice. <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Verbum sat sapienti.</foreign>'"</p>
               <p>Rosamond had cut this out for Sarah's benefit, and kept it in reserve for the
                  right moment, turning the conversation on the marriage at sea for the purpose of
                  introducing the chances of one in California.</p>
               <p>Of course, "a word to the wise was sufficient;" Sarah was intelligent enough to
                  see at once the advantage of being where there was so little competition<pb
                     n="312-313" xml:id="VAC6133-00000157"/> petition, and too decided in character
                  to hesitate a moment before determining in favor of California.</p>
               <p>Rosamond read her thoughts, and continued,—</p>
               <p>"It is no compliment for a woman to get a husband in such a place, as there are
                  twenty eligible men to every woman they see."</p>
               <p>"She need not care for that, since she could have the pleasure of complimenting a
                  man by accepting him before the nineteen others," Sarah replied, elated by the
                  thought of coquetting with a host of admirers again, as in days gone by.</p>
               <p>"I would prefer being complimented myself by being selected from twenty others
                  ready to jump at the offer made to me," Rosamond returned.</p>
               <p>Two small speeches could not more fully illustrate the different characters of the
                  speakers.</p>
               <p>Lucy being present was appealed to, but said, in a way that proved the discussion
                  was not much to her taste, that such a disproportion on either side might have its
                  disadvantages.</p>
               <p>"Lucy, my dear, you must not let your heart be consumed by grief: we seldom die of
                  it; and as we may expect to live on notwithstanding our bereavements, we should
                  give our thoughts to such things as will enter into our duties and enjoyments in
                  our subsequent lives," Sarah said.</p>
               <p>Lucy replied that she was not prepared to be very cheerful; but, nevertheless, she
                  did not think that her grief was more excessive than her father deserved and
                  natural feelings justified.</p>
               <p>"We have only an uncle to mourn for; and though he was as kind as a father to us,
                  we cannot blame Lucy for dwelling more seriously and disconsolately on her loss,"
                  Rosamond remarked.</p>
               <p>"You mean that you have only an uncle to mourn for," Sarah returned, not wishing
                  to hear her husband designated as her uncle.</p>
               <p>That, however, was the way Rosamond in her own heart viewed Sarah's marriage with
                  Mr. Davenport. She doubted whether it was allowable under ordinary circumstances,
                  though really there was no consanguinity between them; and she replied,
                  evasively,—</p>
               <p>"Well, yes, I mean that; but as he was an only uncle, my loss, though not
                  naturally so grievous, is equally, with Lucy's, irreparable, for I cannot have
                  another."</p>
               <p>"And why is not mine, also, pray?" asked Sarah.</p>
               <p>"You married him, and of course can renew the relationship with another at any
                  time by marrying again. I believe it was written on Pompey's Pillar that what man
                  has done man can do; and the same can be said of woman,—what she has done once she
                  can do again as well," Rosamond replied.</p>
               <p>Sarah did not allow her resentment to betray itself, but calmly remarked,—</p>
               <p>"You mistake the meaning of the inscription; for the moral intended to be conveyed
                  is that what has been done by one man can be also done by another; and it is
                  therefore more for the encouragement of the woman who has never had a husband than
                  for her who has been already married."</p>
               <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC6133-00000158"/>
               <p>Yet in her heart she did not reject Rosy's interpretation of the moral. She had
                  won a husband once, and she thought she could do it again, only there was no one
                  in her vicinity then worth the winning, even if she could feel it consistent with
                  her sense of decorum to cast her eyes about in a place where the recent death of
                  her husband was known and would be remembered to her disadvantage.</p>
               <p>She had read too many witticisms at the expense of husband-hunting widows to be
                  ignorant of the suspicion she would incur by going out alone on her venture, and
                  she now hoped to detach Lucy from Rosamond, and making her companion to herself.
                  She would gain a twofold advantage by it,—their united incomes would enable them
                  to live more extravagantly than she could on her own separately, and with Lucy for
                  a decoy, the beaux would not be so much afraid of her designs.</p>
               <p>I hope I will not be judged too severely for writing such uncharitable things
                  against a widow, but I have reason for knowing that her motives were not
                  disinterested, and the candor which should characterize a historian compels me to
                  say all I know. I have more confidence in Rosamond's insight of Sarah's character
                  than in my own, with all the advantages my engagement with her gave me; and
                  Rosamond is no longer the wild, impulsive creature she was when I met her first,
                  that she would say unkind and unjust words of her cousin or any one else.</p>
               <p>Sarah bided her time; and when she and Lucy were by themselves she said,—</p>
               <p>"Lucy, my dear cousin, to resume the thoughts which Rosamond, with her well-meant
                  though ill-timed wit, interrupted to-day, I must remonstrate against the wrong you
                  do yourself by allowing your mind to dwell too much on your sorrows. It is our
                  duty to be cheerful under affliction and bereavement, and the part of sound
                  philosophy to forget what we cannot help.</p>
               <p>"With the loss of your father on your mind, and the effects of your recent
                  sickness yet preying on your body, you ought to try a change of air and scenery.
                  You owe it to your health, and the Giver of such a blessing expects that we will
                  appreciate it enough to guard it by all the means we possess."</p>
               <p>"I do not think my health suffers or is in danger, and I could not be more
                  cheerful any place than here," she replied.</p>
               <p>"Come, you can and will, my dear! You have wept and thought for the dead long
                  enough, and now you must think of yourself and the future. If I see you indulge in
                  such a gloomy trance again, I shall be inclined to think that you are in love, and
                  not at all the disconsolate orphan we have been sorry for."</p>
               <p>Lucy looked with surprise and reproach at her, for so unfeeling a remark, and then
                  turned away her face to hide her tears.</p>
               <p>It must be remembered that Sarah was not<pb n="316-317" xml:id="VAC6133-00000159"
                  /> present when Robert asked Mr. Davenport for Lucy, and therefore was ignorant of
                  the relations existing between them. She thought that Rosamond and Robert were
                  engaged, and said this purposely to offend Lucy, that she might have an
                  opportunity of making an affecting scene between them, which would set them on
                  softer ground with each other.</p>
               <p>She rushed towards Lucy with a girlish vehemence unbecoming to her maturity, and
                  threw herself at her feet, crying,—</p>
               <p>"Forgive me, dear Lucy; I said it to arouse you, it is so long since I saw you
                  smile or look interested. We both have lost our best and only friend, and let us
                  now be friends for his sake. Let us banish that frigid reserve which has existed
                  between us since my marriage, not only to our own prejudice, but also to the
                  sorrow of your dear father.</p>
               <p>"Though you may feel injured by it, and justified in resenting it, you have really
                  lost nothing by my marriage. Your father loved you as much as ever, only your
                  offended manner towards us kept him from demonstrating it to you; and as for what
                  he has left me in his will, you shall have every dollar of it back, for I will not
                  touch it, but will teach, or do something else for an humble living, rather than
                  take yours from you!"</p>
               <p>"No, no, Mrs. Davenport, such a mean, mercenary thought has never entered my
                  heart! Instead of envying you the possession of what you have, I would gladly have
                  seen it more," Lucy answered, feelingly.</p>
               <p>"But I assure you that I cannot touch it, Lucy. It all belongs to you alone, and I
                  should be sorry to let anything like that come between us, related and bound as we
                  are to each other by blood and sympathy. You see the misfortune that has attended
                  the willing of this farm! What else has ever bred discord and dislike between
                  Rosamond and myself, innocent as we both are of the will and the laws which have
                  interpreted it? No such bone of contention shall be between us if I can help it;
                  for I shall give it all up to you, and then, if you feel so disposed, live on your
                  bounty while I am making arrangements for my future, and there will be nothing to
                  embitter our feelings."</p>
               <p>"I trust you do not think I could have bitter feelings towards you, Mrs.
                  Davenport?"</p>
               <p>"Why not? You have not denied it! You made no denial when I said you felt yourself
                  injured by my marriage with your father; and what else could I think of your
                  silence?"</p>
               <p>"I deny it now, Mrs. Davenport. From my heart I wish you a happy future, and if
                  there is anything to be forgiven, you have my free and full forgiveness."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Lucy, you profess Christianity, and it may seem a Christian-like duty to say
                  that you forgive me; but I tell you, Lucy, there is no such thing as forgiveness
                  in this world between mortal and mortal! If you think you are wronged, the
                     feeling<pb n="318-319" xml:id="VAC6133-00000160"/> ing ever remains, for you do
                  not forget it; and saying that you forgive only means that you are magnanimous
                  enough to be willing to forego the luxury of revenge, while the heart remains, as
                  before, estranged from the offender, and dwells upon the injury. This is not such
                  a forgiveness, as God promises to man; for He takes the offender back to his love
                  and forgets the past; while your evasive manner merely says, with the old
                  aphorism, 'It is your fault if you cheat me once; it is my fault if you cheat me
                  twice!'"</p>
               <p>"I have not heard that before. It is very good, I think," Lucy said, with a faint
                  smile.</p>
               <p>Sarah looked disappointed, and resumed,—</p>
               <p>"You admit, then, that it expresses your feelings—that you were offended because I
                  married your father, and that, while you do not wish me ill, you cannot forget the
                  offense? But, Lucy, if I <emph>did</emph> cheat you once, I cannot cheat you
                  again; you have not another father that I can marry; and if you had, I do not
                  think I would care to see the misfortune of my former marriage duplicated," she
                  said, ignoring the fact that she could cheat her out of many things besides a
                  father's love.</p>
               <p>"I hope you do not regard your marriage with my father as a misfortune to you? Did
                  he not always treat you with the kindness of a father or an uncle, if not with the
                  gallantry of a young lover, Mrs. Davenport? And what more could you expect?" Lucy
                  cried, with a slight show of indignation in her manner.</p>
               <p>"Well, I must confess that I expected more than I received, and my marriage
                  experience will last me for a lifetime! I was not foolish enough to think that he
                  would go into ecstasies over me, like a young husband,—a woman never expects that
                  when she marries an old man; but when I married him, expecting a father's love, at
                  least, to replace the love of the father I had lost, and wishing to share a
                  sister's love with you, I was, unfortunately, disappointed.</p>
               <p>"I found your heart closed against me from the first moment of my new life, and
                  impregnable to all my efforts to overcome its prejudice and displeasure. Your
                  father, too, seeing that he had mortally offended you by marrying, and that you
                  would not be reconciled to it, hated me for your sake, and, while I tried to nurse
                  him, insulted me by his suspicions, as if I was another Lucretia Borgia, and was
                  waiting for an opportunity of poisoning him. Yes, Lucy, you may well ask me what I
                  expected, and what I got, by my marriage,—little of the one, and less of the
                  other! I was foolish for doing it, and, if I have injured you, you have been
                  already avenged, and it is not much for you to say that you forgive me enough to
                  let me go without any more punishment."</p>
               <p>By making out a case of injured innocence, she hoped to take advantage of Lucy's
                  tenderness of conscience, and she partly succeeded, for Lucy answered her with
                  tears,—</p>
               <p>"If you have suffered all this, then it is I who<pb n="320-321"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000161"/> should be suing for your forgiveness, for I have
                  caused both yourself and my father unhappiness; and if your married life has been
                  embittered by my manner towards you, I can assure you that you have misunderstood
                  my feelings, for I was never conscious of a thought that would make it less happy
                  for you than you could wish it yourself. And it is for you now, Mrs. Davenport, to
                  forgive <emph>me,</emph> if I have ever, by a word or look, rendered your position
                  in the house, or relation to my father or me, uncomfortable or unpleasant."</p>
               <p>"No, no, Lucy dear! you never have; you have always demeaned yourself well and
                  blamelessly, and it is to my own sensitiveness I owe it. I came here, as I said
                  before, expecting a warm welcome from you, but I could read none in your
                  looks.</p>
               <p>"I have never, in all your life, known you to deceive by word or look, and because
                  since my marriage you have never spoken or even looked any affection for me, I was
                  justified in thinking you had none in your heart. You did not welcome me, as your
                  mother, with any show of love, and I feared you regarded me as an intruder and a
                  rival; for you know you are demonstrative, and when you say nothing, it means that
                  you feel nothing."</p>
               <p>Lucy thought one moment of her long and silent love for Robert, now suppressed and
                  unspoken no more, and then replied,—</p>
               <p>"You are right; my looks and words shall never pretend to what I do not feel; and
                  how could I be pleased to see you my father's wife, when I knew he married you
                  because he had withdrawn his condence and his affection, in a great measure, from
                  me?"</p>
               <p>Robert had betrayed to Lucy enough of Sarah's duplicity to inspire the last
                  clause, and the mute eloquence of her blue eyes gave so much force to the words,
                  that the young widow did not reply with her usual readiness. Lucy continued,—</p>
               <p>"When my father had returned from his unfortunate wedding tour, and before I could
                  have betrayed anything but joy and solicitude at his unexpected return, he showed
                  his estrangement from me; and a month before his marriage took place his manner
                  was altered and mysterious."</p>
               <p>Sarah's ingenuity had given her a reply by this time, and she said,—</p>
               <p>"You know Rosy used to laugh a good deal about the preference Mr. Pearson betrayed
                  for your society, and your father might have become alarmed by her prophecies, and
                  taken offense at the bare possibility of such an event. Old men, and especially
                  invalids, are easily frightened when such a thing is hinted at, and it is not
                  surprising that he should have made a bugbear of Rosy's jests, and thought you
                  really intended to marry Mr. Pearson,—a step he was mortally opposed to."</p>
               <p>This was a skillful double-barreled discharge of spite at Rosamond and myself,—the
                  two whose influence in keeping Lucy from her clutches she thought she had most to
                  fear; but innocence is<pb n="322-323" xml:id="VAC6133-00000162"/> the best shield
                  against craftiness, and Lucy calmly but reproachfully replied,—</p>
               <p>"You ought to have told me this before you married my father, and then all would
                  have been saved the sorrows of a misunderstanding. If you complain of being
                  married to nurse him, and then being suspected of a wish to poison him, remember
                  that you have partly merited it by making no effort to relieve his mind of the
                  errors which were preying upon it, and led him into such an act of seeming
                  monomania."</p>
               <p>Sarah was beaten with the weapons of her own selection, and said,
                  despondingly,—</p>
               <p>"What I have suffered by his error I do not complain of now; for I have erred as
                  much myself, and the natural amiability of his temper had been impaired by pain.
                  What I have been compelled to bear with from Rosamond is different; and, not
                  having your father's peace of mind to consider now, I cannot, with self-respect,
                  longer submit to it. This house is hers, and I owe it both to her and myself to
                  leave it as soon as possible. She will be married to Robert before long, and there
                  will be as little welcome for you then as there is for me now. Young married
                  people are always happiest when by themselves, and let us leave them and go forth
                  together to seek some quiet far-away place, where we can live in retirement and
                  sisterly affection. 'The world is all before us where to choose our place of rest,
                  and Providence our guide."</p>
               <p>The romance of her proposition and the sublimity limity of her quotation was not
                  lost on a mind like Lucy's, but they were not well supported by her facts, since
                  Lucy knew that Robert would not be married to Rosamond.</p>
               <p>She said in reply, therefore,—</p>
               <p>"I have no nearer or dearer relative than Rosy, and no older or better friend than
                  Robert, and I do not know why I should run away from either of them; besides, I do
                  not think they will be married as soon after my father's death as you
                  predict."</p>
               <p>A mind as truthful and explicit as Lucy's was once with every one, will learn to
                  keep its own counsel, and even to equivocate eventually, when confidence has been
                  betrayed, as was proved by her remark about Robert and Rosamond's marriage,—a fact
                  which explains the Saviour's strong denunciation of those who offend the innocence
                  and trustfulness of children.</p>
               <p>"Maybe they will not be married within a month; but you know they will at no very
                  distant day; they will not always mourn for your father; and when they are married
                  you will see a change in them; their sympathies and their thoughts will be
                  centered in themselves more than now. Rosy is egregiously selfish, and even Robert
                  will, after he is married to her, become different from the friend you have known
                  hitherto," Sarah remarked.</p>
               <p>Lucy's eyes kindled, and she betrayed a desire to say that the change which would
                  some time take place in Robert's relation to her would be an agreeable one, but
                  Sarah did not perceive it.</p>
               <pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC6133-00000163"/>
               <p>"Robert has always been in the place of a brother to me, and it is his express
                  desire that I should consult him when I contemplate a step involving so much of my
                  happiness as leaving the farm would," she said.</p>
               <p>"But are you not afraid that taking him at his word may place yourself in a
                  delicate position? The engagement between himself and Rosamond, though existing,
                  is not supposed to be known, and he may think you have understood him in a
                  different sense from what he intended on that account."</p>
               <p>"I do not fear that Robert would suspect me of being so unfeminine," Lucy replied,
                  contemplating, with inward satisfaction, the fact that there was no room for a
                  misunderstanding between herself and Robert; for she was no longer under the
                  necessity of hiding her feelings from him: all was open, confessed, and
                  acknowledged between them now.</p>
               <p>"Oh, it is not at all unfeminine, I assure you; going to a bachelor friend for
                  advice is quite feminine, and custom has made it honorable; and it is because the
                  ruse is so well known that I feared Robert might suspect, and be in doubt what he
                  ought to do."</p>
               <p>"There is, however, no occasion for asking his advice about this matter. I am
                  contented here with Rosy, and when she gets tired of me she will be candid enough
                  to say so."</p>
               <p>"Yes, and it is because she is so candid that I would try to avoid the
                  mortification by anticipating her," Sarah returned.</p>
               <p>This was almost too much for Lucy to bear, well as she had been trained to keep
                  her temper, for to be thus counseled as if she had not sense or delicacy enough to
                  direct her in a matter of this kind was an insult she keenly felt.</p>
               <p>"Let us say no more about my future, Mrs. Davenport; it is all in the hands of
                  God; but if you have anything to say about your own I will hear it with interest,"
                  she said.</p>
               <p>"Mine is in the hands of God, too, I suppose; for it is said that He cares for the
                  widow as well as for the orphan," she sententiously replied, and then abandoned
                  the scheme of using Lucy and her money for her own ends and pleasure.</p>
               <p>The idea of restoring to Lucy the third of her father's money was also abandoned
                  as Quixotic, and with the decision that characterized her, she selected California
                  as her future home, and wrote to secure a state-room in the first steamer going
                  out.</p>
               <p>There were no hollow professions of sorrow when she announced her intention of
                  leaving the house, for the cousins had too much self-respect, and respect for each
                  other's intellects, to make an unmeaning display of tears and epithets.</p>
               <p>Rosamond accompanied her to Philadelphia, and there bade her adieu; but Robert and
                  Lucy went to New York to see her off.</p>
               <p>As she stood in the cabin of the steamer with Lucy, she said,—</p>
               <p>"Now, Lucy, I suppose we will never see each<pb n="326-327"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000164"/> other again, and I should like to feel that I carry
                  the kind wishes with me that I leave behind with you: this parting, you know, is
                  by your consent, and under the circumstances I have more cause to doubt your
                  affection than you have mine."</p>
               <p>Lucy did not appear to notice the reproach the last clause contained, but replied
                  to the first one,—</p>
               <p>"You certainly do, Mrs. Davenport! There is no happiness in this life or that to
                  come which I do not desire for you; and when you are far away on your voyage I
                  shall think of you, and pray for your safe arrival."</p>
               <p>"Yes! yes! you could do all for your enemies, I have no doubt, Lucy!"</p>
               <p>"And what more could I do for myself or my friends? I cannot grant the
                  blessings."</p>
               <p>"You can to me, Lucy; I am starved for love, and since I left home and came to
                  your father's house I have never had a token of it. You have never been politely
                  deceitful; I have never heard you utter a word that was not as true as it was
                  kind, and it is this sincerity that makes me feel how unfortunate I am in
                  separating from you."</p>
               <p>From a proud, spirited woman, no words more humiliating could be expected, and she
                  was very anxious to unite her income with Lucy's when she sued so humbly for her
                  friendship.</p>
               <p>The compliment paid to Lucy's sincerity only made her the more resolved to be
                  sincere, however well she wished her stepmother, and she remained silent.</p>
               <p>"You have only to say the word, Lucy, and we will live together; you need not come
                  with me, for I will remain with you; any place you like we will live together,
                  have one common purpose and interest as long as we live, and nothing but death
                  shall separate us," she continued.</p>
               <p>The Ruthlike devotion of her proposition, and the pathos of her voice, were unable
                  to shake Lucy's determination to part from her; she knew by intuition that her
                  motives were sinister, as the dove knows the hawk by instinct.</p>
               <p>The "word" was not spoken, and Sarah said once more, as a last appeal,—</p>
               <p>"One word, now, Lucy, and the steamer will go without me; I will remain here with
                  you!"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Davenport, I wish you a safe and pleasant voyage from my heart of hearts!"
                  she said, weeping for the sternness of her own will more than for the departure of
                  her cousin, and then they parted. Robert, in attending to her baggage, had
                  finished his last labors for her, and they left her to pursue her course to
                  California, that El Dorado of fortune-hunters and husband-seekers.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
               <p>TWO years have elapsed since the preceding events were recorded, and I now find
                  myself compelled by the force of circumstances to add another chapter.</p>
               <p>It is a duty I owe to those who have with patience followed me through twenty
                  chapters to make my narrative as complete as possible, and the two last years have
                  given me material with which to do it.</p>
               <p>Time, ever passing, brings before us new scenes, and a true light by which to
                  review old ones (viewed before, perhaps, through the colored glasses of prejudice
                  and self-interest), and as an honest man should not hesitate to correct his
                  errors, I find it easier to confess mine in the end of the story, than search over
                  the whole book for them.</p>
               <p>But, to begin with the events. I will first state that Robert and Lucy have been
                  married two years, and threaten to disturb the harmony of natural laws by never
                  letting their honeymoon wane.</p>
               <p>They have a "fairy boy," whose portrait Robert has painted, in hopes, he tells us,
                  that the picture of his innocent infancy might recall the future man to the path
                  of virtue, should he stray from it, as witnessing the child's worship called the
                  lawless robber to repentance in the tale of Paradise and the Peri.</p>
               <p>But Lucy and I, who delight in twitting him, say that the portrait is the fruits
                  of pride in his painting and paternity, because he is constantly sending it for
                  exhibition to the art-galleries of our principal cities, at the expense of a heavy
                  transit insurance.</p>
               <p>However that may be, the picture is one of marvelous beauty and exquisite
                  fineness, and if prolificness was a characteristic of pictures, I should say that
                  it had descended from the one Mr. Davenport had painted and loved before he saw
                  his wife; Lucille, with the blue eyes and sunny hair his imagination had given
                  her.</p>
               <p>This is not the only event I have to record. Six months after Sarah had sailed for
                  California I received a paper by mail which contained a notice of the marriage of
                  Leander Boynton, M. D., and Mrs. Sarah C. Davenport, at the "Cliff House," in San
                  Francisco, and my mind was at once delivered of the following impromptu: "May
                  disappointment never rise, like a phœnix, from the ashes of his hopes!" Some may
                  dispute its originality; but, "alas! there is nothing original within us,
                  excepting original sin."</p>
               <p>The poor victim was overtaken and captured by the female privateer in the very
                  harbor in which he thought he had immunity from the gales and the wars of
                  matrimony; and this paper was a compromise<pb n="330-331"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000166"/> promise with his word, which was pledged to write
                  to me of all his adventures.</p>
               <p>Now, with regard to Rosamond. I suppose the reader has condemned her to perpetual
                  virginity, doing penance for her fickleness by telling over the question of her
                  engagement on the buttons of her wrapper, while sadly ruminating on <emph>what
                     might have been.</emph> Not so. There is no question in her mind, or in mine,
                  about her engagement now, however it was once; for she is engaged, without doubt,
                  and will be until she is married!</p>
               <p>It is to her record I have done injustice, and I would gladly have effaced my
                  errors and strictures from this tale; but as the spoken word cannot be recalled, I
                  will try to place her in a true light in my last chapter.</p>
               <p>Rosamond is now twenty-four, but is far more charming than when she was twenty,
                  for in mind and in person she has improved on herself, ardent, aspiring, and
                  progressive as she was from the first. Her qualities were all positive, Robert
                  said once, but I must add that she had a few negative ones. She was never vain,
                  indolent, or selfish, and I have found in her one who can advance side by side
                  with her husband, instead of holding him back by laziness and lack of
                  appreciation.</p>
               <p>But I have let out my secret, and I must now go back, and tell how it came
                  about.</p>
               <p>As soon as they were married, Robert and Lucy moved into the city, and Rosamond
                  came with them; for she said that a young couple ought to have an old maid in the
                  family to look after their morals and manners.</p>
               <p>I could see, however, that their spirits were not greatly depressed by her
                  society, for the brightness of her eyes, the sprightliness of her wit, and the
                  kindliness of her disposition increased every day, and rendered the idea of her
                  company being of the heavy order preposterous.</p>
               <p>As Lucy had led a retired life while her father lived, and had remained fully as
                  retired on the farm during the interval that followed from his death until her own
                  marriage, the sight-seeing and concert-going which usually belong to courtship
                  came after it.</p>
               <p>Rosamond had been practically as secluded by her Western life, and everything was
                  as new to her as to Lucy. She accompanied them, therefore, and, as three do not
                  make a convenient party, I <emph>accompanied</emph> her, which left Robert and
                  Lucy free to talk of their own affairs, whenever their interest in the
                  entertainment was not kept up. In this way I learned to look upon Rosamond as my
                  own friend and companion, and the past, in which I thought it was treasonable to
                  admire her, was like a dream to me.</p>
               <p>Poor, selfish, narrow-minded bigots are we, and our prejudice and indifference
                  come of the want of knowing our fellow-creatures and ourselves! To know Rosamond
                  was to love her, and to be in her society was to become acquainted with her; for
                  she had a frank, open way about her which<pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC6133-00000167"
                  /> never left me in doubt of her tastes and her qualities.</p>
               <p>It seemed as if the scales had fallen from my eyes when I viewed in her,
                  expressions, manners, moods, and traits of character as different from those I had
                  formerly ascribed to her as day is from night, and discovered beauties of mind and
                  temper which were unknown to me before, well as I had thought I was acquainted
                  with her. Maybe they were forced to bud and bloom by the appreciation they were
                  certain of being greeted with now, for Rosamond could guess how my feelings were
                  disposed towards her at all times during our acquaintance.</p>
               <p>She knew when I first began to like her, and how much my esteem increased each
                  day, and she also knew exactly when my esteem threw off its chrysalis and passed
                  into love.</p>
               <p>She had seen how unfavorable an impression she had made on my mind at first sight,
                  and how long I had retained my prejudice, though she had not betrayed her
                  knowledge by pettishness or retaliation; for Rosamond, I am happy to say, never
                  had that petulance and fretfulness which her sex excuse in themselves as
                  nervousness, and I will not, therefore, have a nervous wife.</p>
               <p>As she was aware of my feelings, I had a smooth road before me. If I retained her
                  hand longer than was necessary at parting, she did not appear to notice it; and if
                  I pressed her arm too emphatically when it rested on mine, she was in blissful
                  ignorance of the fact. There had never been the slightest approach proach to a
                  flirtation between us, and, as my sincerity was not doubted, it was received with
                  sincerity in return.</p>
               <p>At last the time came when I could no longer contain my love, and I asked and
                  obtained my peerless girl.</p>
               <p>We had ridden together one day far into the country (for Rosamond did not entirely
                  give up her favorite exercise when she returned to live in the city), and by some
                  accidental remark my old saying, that the hand which held the bridle firmly would
                  be firm and true in friendship, was recalled. She had so often betrayed her
                  eagerness in adopting my sentiments, and proved their hold on her memory, that I
                  was not surprised to hear her revive this doubtful maxim of mine; and I at once
                  took the opportunity of asking for the hand which was then firmly, though
                  gracefully, holding the reins. According to novelists of a certain school, she
                  should have started, fainted, and fallen off, or at least trembled like an
                  aspen-leaf; but she did neither, for the time which would be wasted in so doing
                  was used to relieve me of suspense.</p>
               <p>With a grave, blushing, but frank face, she assured me that I could have her hand,
                  as she always expected to give it with her heart, and I was already in possession
                  of that.</p>
               <p>It was then I learned how long; for with her hand and heart she seemed to resign
                  her right to keep any of her old or new feelings or secrets from me.</p>
               <p>Our love relation was too novel and strange to<pb n="334-335"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000168"/> us to enable us to speak or think of the future, so
                  our thoughts naturally reverted to the past, and the many unexplained mysteries of
                  our long acquaintance.</p>
               <p>"You did not like me at all when you first knew me," she said, half reproachfully,
                  giving her innocent pony a smart tap on the neck, but turning her face to me with
                  demure gentleness for explanation.</p>
               <p>The vision of the old library, and her entrance, looking so stiff and dignified,
                  rose before me in an instant, and I felt guilty of misjudging her; but I answered
                  evasively, by asking a question in return, for I remembered that Lucy had led her
                  into error by telling her I was a great admirer of dignity.</p>
               <p>"Why do you think I did not admire you when I met you first, Rosy dear?"</p>
               <p>"Because you scarcely looked at me, and you seemed indifferent to everything I
                  said."</p>
               <p>Very impolite of me; and as I could not defend my manners or my taste, I compelled
                  herself to act on the defensive and let my weak points alone.</p>
               <p>"But you were as severe on me: you snubbed me with your dignity, stunned me with
                  your self complacence, and crushed me with your learning."</p>
               <p>"I was then an ignorant, silly girl, and you made me appear worse by indifference
                  and lack of appreciation," she returned.</p>
               <p>"How could you know I did not admire you? It would have been rude of me to tell
                  you so on a short acquaintance, and you have often said you did not like
                  flattery."</p>
               <p>"Well, I do <emph>not</emph> like flattery; but if you had then flattered me, just
                  a little, by a look even, I would have been better pleased with myself and with
                  you: as it was, I felt greatly mortified with the result of our introduction, for
                  Lucy had assured me that we would be delighted with each other."</p>
               <p>"Ah, the gentle mischief-maker! it was she who also told you that I admired
                  dignified people, and persuaded you to overwhelm me by your stately entrance into
                  the library," I said, and I clasped the face that appealed to me in mute
                  surprise.</p>
               <p>No one except a stupid man could have heard that secret from Lucy without knowing
                  why she had tried to be dignified, and sought my admiration with the crudeness of
                  her Western training.</p>
               <p>Her interest in my pursuits and her self-abnegation in conforming her tastes to
                  mine, as I often accidentally discovered, ought to have taught me the story of her
                  love long before her lips had confessed it; for so wholly could she give
                  everything, small and great, where her heart was bestowed, that I even found, in
                  looking over her handwriting, she had learned to make her capitals like mine, odd
                  as they were in many instances, and in several other ways betrayed an assimilating
                  tendency which could only be the spontaneous fruits of an unselfish love.</p>
               <p>However, I did not speak of this then, for I merely remarked that I thought she
                  was destined<pb n="336-337" xml:id="VAC6133-00000169"/> by fate for Robert, and
                  therefore not eligible to my admiration.</p>
               <p>"But could you not admire me even if I could not be your wife? Is it not
                  selfishness to depreciate a thing because it does not belong to yourself?" she
                  asked.</p>
               <p>I could not gainsay it; so to defend myself I was compelled to attack her
                  again,—</p>
               <p>"So you would have been better pleased with me had I shown more admiration for you
                  when we first met?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I was angry with you for turning to Mr. Davenport so soon, as if you thought
                  I was a verdant, uninteresting country-girl."</p>
               <p>"And then, afterwards, when I turned with more appreciation to you, and seemed to
                  be interested in your tastes and ideas, you liked me a good deal better?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, I loved you, and would from the first moment had you not shown such a superb
                  indifference towards me."</p>
               <p>"But is not that a species of self-love, Rosy? To be displeased at a man because
                  he does not bow down and worship you, and then, afterwards, to like him better
                  because he shows a greater sense of your merits, is not loving the man, but
                  yourself. What shall I do with you, dear? You love yourself, and not me, after
                  all!"</p>
               <p>"No, I love you, and ever will; and you must take my self-love with myself, for I
                  do not think we can ever be separated," she said, with the frankness ness and
                  confidence of a girl who knows how well she is beloved.</p>
               <p>"Willingly. I would not have you a single iota less in anything. I have known you
                  too long to doubt your love, or your knowledge of your own heart, and, in fact, I
                  think you have loved me for many years," I returned.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I have, almost from the time I first met you, only sometimes I thought I
                  would never get you, and I tried to feel indifferent."</p>
               <p>Admiration, wonder, and self-condemnation kept me silent for awhile; for here was
                  a girl, who was not half an hour my betrothed, speaking as freely as if she had
                  been my wife for years, though she had never, before I asked her for it, betrayed
                  the love she cherished under such unfavorable circumstances. She also spoke of
                  "getting me" with a self-abasement which entirely ignored my good fortune in
                  getting her.</p>
               <p>But such is the case; the more a woman gives a man, or sacrifices for him, the
                  more she will love him and forget self. Her truth, good sense, and holy purposes
                  seem nothing in her own mind; she brings her gifts to the altar with humility, and
                  is grateful because they are accepted.</p>
               <p>It is she who has nothing to give who loves least, thinks most of self, demands
                  and absorbs everything and makes no return.</p>
               <p>"Well, the mistakes of the past are corrected now, and let them be forgotten in
                  our life, dear, where heart shall be open to heart for evermore,"<pb n="338-339"
                     xml:id="VAC6133-00000170"/> I said, after my surprise had been overcome; and my
                  horse reared because the bridle hand was heavy on his mouthbit, as my arm strained
                  Rosy to my heart.</p>
               <p>"So then it was because you loved me that you dismissed Dr. Boynton in such a
                  queenly manner, and sent him to California with a wound in his head?"</p>
               <p>"You looked so withering at me when he stretched out on the lounge, though I do
                  not suppose the simple coxcomb intended me any disrespect by doing it. You do not
                  know what a bitter cry I had when he left me alone, for I supposed I had forfeited
                  your good opinion, and was afraid to look up at you when you returned with
                  Lucy."</p>
               <p>"And for me you broke off that long engagement with Robert,—our own peer?"</p>
               <p>Her gloved hand was laid over my mouth, and she cried out, earnestly and
                  reprovingly,—</p>
               <p>"I was never engaged to him, or to any one else; it was only a foolish
                  misunderstanding. You and Robert conspired to betray us, and divide the spoil
                  according to your own pleasure; but we conquered, Lucy and I, and you are taken
                  and appropriated yourselves."</p>
               <p>Just so. Robert and I had often confessed as much to each other; for neither of us
                  are sensitive of the blunders of the past. His attentions, and my seeming
                  indifference, had forced poor Rosamond into the embarrassing position from which
                  her own good sense and true heart finally extricated her; and we shall hereafter
                  laugh at our blunders in once making love to each other's wives.</p>
               <p>We had set out on the journey of life as philosophers, provided, as we thought,
                  with knowledge and rules for weighing, measuring, and demonstrating all the
                  uncertainties of mind and matter, but before we had reached our thirtieth
                  milestone we found that our rules were uncertain, our philosophy was crude, and we
                  knew nothing at all.</p>
               <p>We are now humble, though happy, and, as we are not too old to learn yet, we hope
                  the past experience will not be lost upon us; but that, with help and
                  encouragement from our fair and loving wives, we may become wise and useful, if
                  not remarkable, men.</p>
