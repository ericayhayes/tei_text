ON a chilly ?Tovemter afternoon there stood near the&#xD;
gutter, in Passyunk RAoad below Shippen Stieet in Phira-&#xD;
delphia, a little girl with a basket in her hand, waiting for.&#xD;
her drunken father who was looking in at a shop-window.&#xD;
She had a very sad face and was about ten years old. The&#xD;
shop before which the man stood was close by, and was one&#xD;
of a kind common in the neighbourhood; its stock consist-&#xD;
ing of an assortment of miscellaneous merchandise.&#xD;
The drunkard'a bare hands were half sunk down into&#xD;
his antaloons' pockets, and he had that weak-in-the-back&#xD;
look, so usual in those of his habit. His hat was old, and&#xD;
half - slouched over his forehead. A maudlin gaze was&#xD;
directed uponi tbe display before him, but his face had a&#xD;
vacant stare and his eyes a glassy look, le appeared to&#xD;
have forgotten every thing he had ever known and himself-&#xD;
too.&#xD;

There was an, impress of character. upon the child's,&#xD;
face. She could not be older than the age mentioned, yet&#xD;
there was traced legibly in lines not to be mistaken, the&#xD;
care-worn look of which we think as belonging of right only&#xD;
to the mature in years ;-and I thank God every day of my.&#xD;
life that .it ,is so: :tht the multitude of little children.&#xD;
throughout fie wiIde world retel inthe happy unconscious/&#xD;
ness of the toil and struggles which those who love therii&#xD;
endure, and cheerfully too, for their sakes. A little cuily&#xD;
head, Annie, whom we. call Bunny-face, that plays every&#xD;
day underneath my study window when the weather is fair&#xD;
enough for her to do so, what a different look she has ,out&#xD;
of her eyes from that of the one standing with such thin&#xD;
clothes on, and shivering at the c0ity, gutter-side, and who&#xD;
has evidently conned over many pages of life's experience,&#xD;
and learned lessons of tria and endurance,&#xD;
Sh stoodhfora few minutes, 'the father absorbed in&#xD;
his reverie at the window, when two other girls of about&#xD;
the same ag, and livingin the neighborhood, came out of'&#xD;
a so      eral door of and walked on together in the&#xD;
,directionowards her. They were without their bonnets,&#xD;
but theiclothing was warm,_And made up of materials of&#xD;
bright colours  d very large figures. The two were&#xD;
absorbed inisdiscussion about their dress, and their tones&#xD;
as they walked along grew angrier,'every moment ;-when,&#xD;
looking up, they suddenly aw the pale shabby little thing&#xD;
before tim, and laughed out, rude, at her.&#xD;
The colour pushed up into the poor child's face; and&#xD;
her little iti quivered all arodndfwith suffering. The&#xD;
tears started, butwith a firm resoleA she' forced them back,&#xD;

and her eyelashes dropped as though she would shut out&#xD;
the sight of the tormentors in front of: her&#xD;
"Oh, what a love of a bonnet,-is'ntit Maria Jane?"&#xD;
said the one infiery red scattered all-over with hig palm&#xD;
leavesto her companion, asshe glayjced contemptuously at&#xD;
the- over-large, motherly-looking article on the ,"hild's&#xD;
head. "Just see thenice clean stringS tool It looks as&#xD;
if it was the last. fresh fashion, take it all in all, does 'at_&#xD;
it? "&#xD;
"I like most the young lady's dress ,"-scoffingly&#xD;
replied Ahe other, ag yith a scat  look0h., noted the&#xD;
half-worn and evidently altered garment before her--and&#xD;
then, lowering her eyes, rested them with, satisfaction upon.&#xD;
the yellow and maarmrine4blue texture enveloping her ow&#xD;
fat person, and in which these two colours struggled, in&#xD;
large dots, for predominance. Soon, renewing her atre, she&#xD;
continued: "The waist looks as if it belonged to seme big&#xD;
old aunty, and the skirt cut off short: and such: a sha l&#xD;
too!   I wonder where the other three-quarters;have&#xD;
walked off! Can you tell, Angelina ? "_ and she looked&#xD;
quizzically into the face of her associate.,&#xD;
"I do n't -know,.1I'm sure; but I guess to hunt up a&#xD;
pair of stockings. Oh see, what a. beautiful esh colour&#xD;
hers are; and the shoes too, are of a holy ,Pern." This&#xD;
miserable pun wasfollowed y a derisive laugh from both&#xD;
of them.&#xD;
They waited a moment in expectation of an answer to&#xD;
their taunts, but as none eame, they renewed their giving&#xD;
talk  and,, moving still 'closer  towards their victim,&#xD;
endeavored to push her off the curb-stone into the gutter;&#xD;

and would have succeeded had she not held on with her&#xD;
disengaged hand -toan awning-post, near which they were&#xD;
standing. They then tried to tread upon her toes peeping&#xD;
through her shoes, and she with difculty preventedtem;&#xD;
for, her earnest and touching supplication of "lease-&#xD;
don't!" fell upon deaf ears.&#xD;
It was' over-fed and: warma-clothed vulgarity ,spitting-&#xD;
out its" venom ,upon the- powerless--a sight sad and&#xD;
pitiable-yet,under many different guises, alas! how often-&#xD;
to be seen.&#xD;
The voices of the children rose louder and louder, and'&#xD;
an' unusually earnest ""Ohlease don't!" reached the&#xD;
ears of the father, who turning , round, instinctively&#xD;
comprehended at a glaice, halfdrunk as he was, the&#xD;
ignominious position' of his child. A  flush of shame'&#xD;
spread over his face' as he walked unsteadily towards her,&#xD;
and taking her by the hand he led her away. A group of&#xD;
other "children, boys and girls,-of .the Maria Jane and&#xD;
Angelina genus,-had already gathered around, and amid:&#xD;
their united gibes and jeers the drunken father and&#xD;
miserable child proceeded some distance further down the&#xD;
street until a passing -showman, with a monkey and a&#xD;
violin, arrested the, attention of the vicious juveniles, and&#xD;
the pair were permitted to go unmolested, on their way.&#xD;
Along, down the ,Pasyunk 'Road' they walked some'&#xD;
distance, and then turned into'-a miserable looking cross-&#xD;
street. After travelling it nearly the length of a square&#xD;
they u6e to    narrow  tuubl-down-srt of a court,&#xD;
which' they entered, ad stopping at"its further end,&#xD;

man. fumbled through his pockets.for the key of the door,&#xD;
whioh was looked.,&#xD;
Nor iril;norianyhad' spoken one word to each other-;&#xD;
silently and in shame they had walked hand in hand to&#xD;
their -home. "PAther," at length she said, rousing her&#xD;
faculties with an efrtyou -know I took,,the k3y this&#xD;
morning, and I was to call for you after I had rsold my&#xD;
nimatches -and things ;" at the same time producing from&#xD;
the original large pocket of her dress the door-key ; and&#xD;
unlocking it, they went into the room'together.&#xD;
The place was, as the:girl had left it 'in: the morning,&#xD;
tidyed up for the. day, and, was lighted by, one dormer&#xD;
window. It was altogether very poor*looking. A small&#xD;
sheet-iron stove, stood in that part. where the -ceiling was&#xD;
the highest, just under the mid-gable- of the roof, and the&#xD;
stovepipe holeopened directly into the chimney.&#xD;
She busily bestirred herself and soon lighted a fire in&#xD;
the stove and on its top set soinewater-'in a.vessel to heat&#xD;
which she poured: out from a bucket-full that. stood in a&#xD;
corner.  The more steadily she worked the better phe&#xD;
appeared to feel. The" man sate down upon a chair which&#xD;
had no back and leaning forward hid his face in his hands;&#xD;
but as he felt the warmth of the fire he; stretched them out&#xD;
towards the stove ,to warm   them, stealing a glance&#xD;
occasionally at his child.  The wretched fellow  was&#xD;
sobering.&#xD;
At length, after.she hgd made a cup of tea. in which&#xD;
were neither sugar nor mIk, she approached him gently&#xD;
and said: "Father please drink this. It will make you&#xD;

better;:laying at:the .same ime her hand softly upon&#xD;
his arm. Their eyes met-and, as they looked long and&#xD;
wistfully at each other, tears filled themand the words:&#xD;
"My poor child A and "h father I" felrom. their&#xD;
lips.d&#xD;
Come here, poor little onel" he said; and she, came&#xD;
and' croudhed down on the bare floors her headsresting on&#xD;
his knees,-and began to sob as if her heart would break;&#xD;
andhe,with his shaky handasmoothed her brown curly&#xD;
hair and'tried to soothe her weeping. He uttered words&#xD;
of affection every,,gow and then, tears coursigg down his&#xD;
cheeks-drunkards are givento. crying-but the child's,&#xD;
breast headed onsurestrainedly for the pent up feelings&#xD;
must sometimeshave a vent.&#xD;
"YTur father loves dearly his, por motherless child;"&#xD;
he said, after- some time had elapsed, and the words almost&#xD;
choking him "no matter how little it may seem that he'&#xD;
does."&#xD;
She looked up into hisce and wiping her eyes with&#xD;
the sleeve'of her dress, said in a wiper, Father do talk&#xD;
to me aboit mother. Tell me afl you can remember; it will&#xD;
do me more goodthan any thing else i" and her face sunk&#xD;
again downuponhi knees and the sobs succeeded each&#xD;
thei after gradually longer intervals.&#xD;
There w a silence on his part of several, minutes,&#xD;
but afe6 clearinghis throat two or three times, in a husky&#xD;
tone, he said&#xD;

printr-of..the tOwn and editor .of apapgr the young&#xD;
husband was regarded as a man of important in the&#xD;
settlement ; besides he was intelligent and kind-hearted.&#xD;
Lsucy West was ashappy abride as many another whose&#xD;
fate has turned out as sadly as her own.&#xD;
The irst blothat came to them after her bridal was&#xD;
t4xdearthof. er fher:    then   .heir first child a boy,&#xD;
of two years old,died. Their grayes are in that far-off&#xD;
western itygehurehyard on tje sloping side .of a green&#xD;
hl. It was one nights a few  eeks after the, death of&#xD;
the little oy, that Mr. Westwas induced by two of his&#xD;
friends, rich men and irp 4rtant pa1rgns, to go out with&#xD;
them, on sone election business; and, after midnight, they&#xD;
brought hiin.to his home stupidly drunk ! Ever from that&#xD;
hour. a baleful star threw its malignant rays over their&#xD;
pathway.: No tears could quench it, and it at last drank&#xD;
pd-ropafter drop, the life blood of,!the patient, suffering&#xD;
wife. Property, friends; respect of townsfolk, all gradually&#xD;
disappeared. She followehim aown, down into- ever&#xD;
lower depth of degradation. From town to town, and city&#xD;
to city, theywandered; and she was the ministering angel&#xD;
who.wasever ready to pity, and ,to. hope that, each new&#xD;
falling away wouldJbe the last. Their little girl Lizzie was&#xD;
only one .year old when they left the town where the mother&#xD;
had been once so happy a bride.&#xD;
Mr. West was a rapid and correct compositor, 'and&#xD;
time and again with his intellectual ability, h might have&#xD;
risenhigher'In the soial scale than he had ever been before,&#xD;
but for the demon of strong. drink, It b'o'nd him- as&#xD;
strongly as the Python encircled-the old priest in ancient&#xD;
&#xD;
Grecian story, and the poisonousbreathof, histemptation&#xD;
benuibed its victim so that his struggles became feebler&#xD;
andstill more feeble.&#xD;
The rinducements to drink about a printig-office are&#xD;
frequent, and to a lover of it almost, overpowering  The&#xD;
craft are'. toa fault. generous with money, and are&#xD;
exceedingly courteous and gentlemanly in theirintercourse&#xD;
with each other. In the offices where, he was employed he&#xD;
was often pressed to indulge irn drinks to which -he- was&#xD;
treated, and then, after the taste was once imbibed, there&#xD;
was no; stay until his. " spree " was out.&#xD;
It was about two years before the present time that&#xD;
Mrs. West, -heart-broken, died;' and the expenses of her&#xD;
funeral were paid, and willingly too- by the combined&#xD;
contributions of the journeymen printers of the city,"who&#xD;
turned out in a body to pay the last token of respect to one&#xD;
who -was generally known among them as the true-hearted&#xD;
wife of their drunken brother-workman.&#xD;
Lizzie's childhoodJad bgn darkened by sorrow and&#xD;
straitened circumstances.  The cloud was scarcely ever&#xD;
lifted up.,In funereal gloom it had shut.in, her youth-time&#xD;
amid its dark enfoldings.  No wonder the child was&#xD;
premature, and that a careworn look was deeply defined&#xD;
upon her little face which, had it but worn the joyous&#xD;
expression usual in. childhood, wogld have been beautiful&#xD;
as the realization of a "poet's dream."  Nowi that her dear&#xD;
mother was gone, still deeper settled the darkness around&#xD;
her;- and she had to standias much so as a child could, in&#xD;
that dear mother's place to her erring father.&#xD;
She earned what she could by selling matches, tapes&#xD;

for her father; aihd he crept into bed and fu  a l-ngfwhile&#xD;
.watched her thin, sweet face, untiLat lengthhe fell aleep.&#xD;
She sewed on, and on -but her thoughts were not .upon&#xD;

that she had heard that was new to her about:her mo er.&#xD;

but no miser ever loved gold as she did the, memory ofher&#xD;
dead mother; each'sgeparaht instance of ,her devoted love&#xD;
was a pearl of priceless value in the child's Casket of the&#xD;
Past, and every new knowledge of her self-sacrifice was as&#xD;
if she heard the harping of some angel lyre encouraging&#xD;
her in the mission of duty to the father left behind.&#xD;
The remembrance forcibly returned to her mind as she&#xD;
sat there in the silence-interrupted only by the deep&#xD;
breathing of her father-of that afternoon, the last time,&#xD;
that her mother ever went ou when they two took some&#xD;
sewing that was finished to a lady's house,and upon their&#xD;
return her mother would stop in at an .ice-cream saloon,&#xD;
and, purchasing a single saucersat with her at the marble&#xD;
table in the grand-looking room and there, with her face&#xD;
all lit up with unutterable love,fed her out of the silver&#xD;
spoon, with mouthful after mouthful of the cool delicious&#xD;
cream, and would not take one particle of it herself-&#xD;
.although she begged her hard to do so. All the scene came&#xD;
back so vividly before her that she felt as if it was again a&#xD;
reality; that her mother was now very near her and her&#xD;
arms almost around her.&#xD;

evening hymn sounded out on the midnight. hour, in a soft&#xD;

TEN years--a'long period in &amp;amp; human lifehas passed&#xD;
since the time when was introduced to our readers the&#xD;
drunkard-father and the- care-tricken, child. That child&#xD;
had grown into woman's years. The father was -still a&#xD;
victim to his vice.&#xD;
There had been during this interval frequent temporary&#xD;
lulls of reformation in the man's, dissipation... ut the&#xD;
monster in his bosom still lived on,,and was warmed again&#xD;
and again into new lifeand then, with-,erectedfCrest and&#xD;
forked - tongue re-asserted its fiend-like ,supremacy. He&#xD;
was weaker far, mentally, morally and. physically, than&#xD;
would be ordinarily produced by ten years' wear and tear&#xD;
in this world of ours:--his hair was .now almost all white&#xD;
and his,-face was plowed: with deep furrows  His whole&#xD;
physique was animalized, and his mouth especially had&#xD;
become Silenus-like in its expression, besides his beard was&#xD;
nearly; always in a. neglectedstate :-sad indeed, were&#xD;
the changes that ten years had wrought upon Joseph West,&#xD;

and for the most part they were the effects of indulgence&#xD;
in his degrading vice.&#xD;
He had not for a long time been able to work at&#xD;
his trade; but was employed occasionally at odd services,&#xD;
about a few of the printing-ofces--sometimes perform-&#xD;
ing the duties of roller-boy  and  oing upon errands.&#xD;
He also folded- newspaeis, andabld them in the&#xD;
streets. He seemed, to the exiting race of journeymen&#xD;
printers, an old patriarch of the craft-and most of them,&#xD;

in the business of diessbiaking which she now, followed.&#xD;
The ladies for whoan she,-worked frequently became&#xD;

many ways ; and the noble 'fIlial heroism which her life&#xD;
displayed reflected back upon theme an influence for good,,&#xD;
which now and 'then came -to the :girl's knowledge, causing&#xD;
her cheeks to glow and her heart to beat with gratitude.&#xD;

They now occupied the third story of a house- in: a clean!&#xD;

floor, and the advantage of having placed on the window"&#xD;

thereto "Fashionable -Dress Maker."  There were three&#xD;
rooms on their third floor. One large one back,in which.&#xD;
they lived and ate; and two smaller onefin front-which&#xD;
gave a chamber, for herself whte' she in warm weather&#xD;
sewed, and the- other was a sleeping room for her father,.&#xD;

path the only question be appeared at all interested in&#xD;
Asking, was -If tay knew a printer, Joseph West, and&#xD;
What could they tell him about his family?"&#xD;
It is wonderfalthe ways in which information of the&#xD;
"whereabouts" of one particular 'individual -is spread&#xD;
abroaa... There are, as it were, thousands of unseen electric&#xD;
wires surrounding eaeh uo of us that telegraph far and&#xD;
wide td our acquaintance all about us; and thus, away far&#xD;
o&amp;amp;t in unbroken prarie lands, strange as it may seem,,and&#xD;
again amid the stillness of primeval forests, Mr.'Brown&#xD;
heard at intervals -Nomething of the Wests. But all he&#xD;
heard was very sad    And oftentimes did Mis, West&#xD;
receive fronirthe:Post-office letters,which contained small&#xD;
sums of noneywith no writinginside of them, bearing&#xD;
the post-ma-ksf places she did not know,on the extreme&#xD;
verge of immigration.   They 'generally came just; when&#xD;

THE PRINTER 'S DAUGHTER.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
some imperative exigency seemed most desperate-and the&#xD;
faith of the woman, whose heart was breaking, looked upon&#xD;
,  them as "sent from God'.  So indeed they were, for it was&#xD;
His power that kept ever flowing in the hear-t of the disap-&#xD;
pointed man, the "'well spring" of his early loveand made&#xD;
it gush a healthful stream;-for in itA mirrored surface were&#xD;
pietured onlyr pleasant scenes of early life to cheer his&#xD;
lonely lot, and along its sides amid leaves of perennial&#xD;
greenness,looked out violets and Forget Me Nots--a bunch&#xD;
of which the young girl had given him one summer-night&#xD;
long ago!-and ever after these flowers were to him but&#xD;
semblances of Lucy Ashton's sweet blue eyes.&#xD;
Lucy was born in the village where Daniel Brown&#xD;
lived; and 'as far back as she could remember. he was&#xD;
always "a grown up young man." She had ever regarded&#xD;
him as one of her kindest and best friends, and felt towards&#xD;
him as a sister to an older brother. A strong friendship&#xD;
grew with her growth on her part towards him, and that&#xD;
afternoon she told him, all blushing and in whispers, in the&#xD;
old woods in which they oftentimes walked-where the&#xD;
trees seemed giants sprung up out of the. earth to bow&#xD;
their tall green heads in worship when veiled by the storm-&#xD;
cloud, or to whisper praises in low rustling tones as zephyrs&#xD;
swept among their canopy of leaves-of her intended&#xD;
marriage with Joseph West, the handsome intelligent&#xD;
young printer, she could not understand the reason of the&#xD;
'sudden paleness and the pained-look which so changed the&#xD;
expression of W4 kind, honest face. She never knew that&#xD;
on that day, and there, an arrow sank into his heart the&#xD;

pain of whichcould only be assuaged by thoughts of her&#xD;
own innocent loveliness*&#xD;
The man, at length, determined to return and look&#xD;
again upon the face that to hia had been as a dream of&#xD;
heaven 1-a weary interval of years had gone by since he had&#xD;
last heard of the printed's family ;-and he turned his foot-&#xD;
steps eastward. When he reached Philadelphia Mrs. West&#xD;
had long been buried. The hunter visited the home of the,&#xD;
girl and her father, and he thought his heart would rise up&#xD;
in his throat and choke him when he saw its destitution and&#xD;
wretchedness. He resolved at once for the mother's sake,&#xD;
to watch over her child as long as he lived; and, collecting.&#xD;
some small means togetherihe opened a grocery store in&#xD;
that city. So guileless had his long communion with&#xD;
Nature made him, that he was unfitted to compete with the&#xD;
craft and business-cunning of othersi- the trade, and the&#xD;
profits of his business,,hard, as he worked at it, scarcely&#xD;
yielded him a support.., His great object however was&#xD;
attained, he saw- that sdbe never wanted. Basket,, after&#xD;
basket-full, of necessary.articles, was, time and again, left&#xD;
at Mr. West's; and when remonstrated with, he always&#xD;
told "his child Lizie,"---for thus would he now call&#xD;
her, that "there was a long unsettled account against him&#xD;
between her mother and himself which he feared he never&#xD;
could pay ; and that he was only trying to 'keep down&#xD;
the interest." Lizzie believed this to be some sort of a kind&#xD;
snbtezuge, and the old man grew into her heart a kindly&#xD;
object to venerate and love.&#xD;
The three were -now ready to start. $. West walked&#xD;
in the middle with his arm inserted-within Mr. thrown's,&#xD;
&#xD;
TIE PRINTER'S DAUGHTER.                  47&#xD;
and his-daughter stationed herself on the 'other side -ready&#xD;
to render assistance in getting her father along  The streets&#xD;
were almost deserted. They soon passed into Pine Street&#xD;
and walked.along it uotil they came to Ninth, up he west-&#xD;
side of which ,they turned. The point they wished to&#xD;
reach was a court running alongside of St. ephen's church&#xD;
in Tenth Street below Market. None of them seemed&#xD;
disposed to talk, The Walnut Street Theatre was out, and&#xD;
Miss West felt an inward gratulation that they would not&#xD;
be exposed to the rude gaze of its frequenters. -Before she&#xD;
.was aware of it, however,-they were mixed up with a crowd&#xD;
hanging around the deor of the splendid mansion on the&#xD;
corner of Chestnut and Ninth Streets.&#xD;
It was the evening of a magnificent fete. The line&#xD;
of carriages extended some distance up -Chestnut Street on&#xD;
both sides of the way. As some of the guests were now&#xD;
going home,a glimpse of them was afforded to the bystanders&#xD;
as they came -down the steps and got into their carriages.&#xD;
Th6 two woIld immediately have crossed over to the other&#xD;
side of the street, and thus have gotten out of the crowd,&#xD;
but Mr. West in an obstinate tone, said: 'dHe would 'nt&#xD;
budge until he had seen some of the nobs go home!" He.&#xD;
was deaf to their entreaties and declared again,in a louder&#xD;
voice, hi aetermination  To avoid an altercation, and as&#xD;
the IeAt of two evils,they thought it best to -gratify him ;&#xD;
and turning the coru&amp;amp;,of Ninth Street they-stopped along-&#xD;
side the steps leading from the -house.&#xD;
-The front-door stood open, and the vestibule was&#xD;
billiatily lighted. A servant standing on the steps as&#xD;
they came up, called out in a loud voice for "General Pa-&#xD;

out of the line aid- drove up ;t the marble stone, jus in&#xD;
front of the house. A footman got down fron behind and&#xD;
opening its door let down the steps. The inner door of&#xD;
the hall, swun  open at the same time, and a group, two&#xD;
ladies with shawls i their hands attended by a gentleman,&#xD;
,stepped onto the vestibule.&#xD;
One of the ladies was elderly, and her stately form not&#xD;
yet decrepid with age, was robed in black sati and lace.&#xD;
On her*head was a cap of snowy whiteness with a trimmig&#xD;
of light wavy feather, and her silver hair, i a few natural&#xD;
curls, shaded her sweet venerable face. The other was&#xD;
young, and dressed in pink tarleton of Maany skirts' which&#xD;
floated All around herm rosy haziness. In her hair was a&#xD;
wreath of whiteIoses, and a cross. of diamonds rested on&#xD;
her breast. Eer hair and eyes were dark, an  e flash of&#xD;
the diamonds was not brighter than that ef her brilliant&#xD;
eyes.&#xD;
The young lady discovering she had forgotten her&#xD;
boquette turned to the gentleman and said,; Oh, Mr .Ran-&#xD;
gIolph, please go back and get my flowers. They are in the&#xD;
ladies' dressing-room. I remember laying them on the&#xD;
toflette-table. YozUr mother and myself will wait here&#xD;
until you return." He bowed and started on his commission;&#xD;
then, turning to her companion, she continued:-" Per-&#xD;

the steps,&#xD;
She glanced haughtily at the crowd on the pavement&#xD;
ranged on each side of the door,untilher eyes rested upon&#xD;
Miss West and her father; and, as if by-sometalismanic&#xD;
spell, the gaze of the two girls rivetted, ead upon theother.&#xD;
Then, from the dim lapse ofeseven years arose vividly to&#xD;
both, the memory of another.scene,, A gtrr side-a far&#xD;

earlier acquaintance that now stood so near, and yet so. far&#xD;
off, our fair heroine.&#xD;
Mrs. Randolph also had been attracted by the sight of&#xD;
the girl standing aon the motley group, and she sighed in&#xD;
her inmost heart over the fate of the poor street-walker ;-&#xD;
"And she is so beautiful! '-Theamoonlight fell upon her&#xD;

radiance. The blue shawl, andlig    straw-bonnet wth&#xD;

countenance.&#xD;
The inner door again opened-and the young man&#xD;
with the boquette came out into the vestibule,,and offering&#xD;
his arm to his mother    coached Miiss Pa4elford to escort&#xD;

and they two, when together, built many a cloud Castle in&#xD;
Spain, looking towards. the, time when he should have&#xD;

struggling-thatof the law-as would enable them to have&#xD;
again a home of their own.&#xD;
Ten  ears,  stated,  had elapsed sinbe the time our&#xD;
Narrative coimenced, and I must now ask my readers to&#xD;
go with me into a low drinking-saloon of Philadelphia.&#xD;
It is in a cellar and the neigbourhood "down town."  The&#xD;
floor is sanded. The chairs andtables, with half.the paint&#xD;
worn p1; areo cut and dilapidated The company is such as&#xD;
yonmight expect to see: forthe most part miserably poor,&#xD;
andif giut so, sadly depraved. At a table sat Mr. West,&#xD;
seeming ahnst imbecile but for the eager, covetous looks&#xD;
with which he regarded the decanters ranged on a shelf&#xD;
behindthbare-madthe contents of which he had neither&#xD;
the moneynor rit to buy    The liquor sold here, gener-&#xD;
aIly, was of a vile sort; drugged t suit the morbid, thirsty&#xD;
&#xD;
throats f veteran drinkbrs,.whose   constitution were&#xD;
additionally poisoned by each draught they swallowed.&#xD;
There were men, single and in groups, oattprgd in&#xD;
various patof the saloon, which was; longad  xteaded&#xD;
back~ It was a chilly evening out of doors, for a dense fog&#xD;
had hung around all day ; adt wasabotfor o'4o     in&#xD;
the afternoon. There were a few jets of  asJighted, here&#xD;
and there, bnt gloom was the characteristi pfthe apart-&#xD;
ment-and the, shuffling, staggering figures lopmed o14&#xD;
obscurely into huge shapes Qf wretchedness.&#xD;
From a private box, before which a curtain had been&#xD;
drawn, walked out two men. They had beenengged for&#xD;
a long time, within in a whispered Aconyersat~in, and ox' the&#xD;
table they had left,stood glasses, and an empty ecanter-w&#xD;
besides several plates onwhich oysters.had been aerved.&#xD;
One of them was quite young-flashy-looking, with a&#xD;
sensual countenance and a swaggering air, which, for the&#xD;
moment, seemed somewhat subdued. The other was about&#xD;
forty-five years old and on his marked face was expressed&#xD;
evil, passions. and vice. H e had the look of a hard,&#xD;
resolute, bad man; of dark complexion and a. heavy beard.&#xD;
Therewas a sinister glance of intelligence in his black eyes&#xD;
that overawed and betokened power, and was calculated, to&#xD;
abash those he designed to inRuence and with whom he&#xD;
talked.&#xD;
The latter wentup to the counter a  taking a handful&#xD;
of silver from his pocket placed on it a couple of half-dollars&#xD;
to settle the billat the same time looking around searchingly&#xD;
at the different person in the room. The . younger walked&#xD;
upto the stove and stood before  with a troubled, irreso-&#xD;

After the change was pocketed, the lider approached&#xD;
his coipanion and laying his hand on his shoulder, said to&#xD;
him in a 'low toe  glancing qicly towards Mr. West':&#xD;
Charley, my man that old fellow there, will Uit s exactly&#xD;
D       st t you think so?"I&#xD;
'He started, and looked suppheatingly into the fae&#xD;
that regarded him with an unpitying look, and said:&#xD;
"Oh Reviere do nt-not now-wait few days longer I"&#xD;
"The air is dhlly and it has affeeted your nerves,&#xD;
boy ! You want something t warm you. Come take&#xD;
another drink "then turning, and bowing towards Mr.&#xD;
West, he inteogatively remained in a loud enough tone to&#xD;
be heard by him-"You 'will perhaps, Sir, do us the favor&#xD;
to drink withil-'&#xD;
The words'eore sarcely spoken before the old man&#xD;
ansebed, "AYes, thank yoi;" and quky walked toaards&#xD;

Revier-e bent his head close down to the ear of the&#xD;
other, and whispered:-"The very man, Charley.I&#xD;

A  ohee men went upto the counter and hquor was&#xD;

raimg them   o thei lips he said:-" Gentlemen, Ihave&#xD;

looking towards Charley-" it is," success to his enterprise!P"&#xD;

"Well, let us. drink it!" was the reply of old West,&#xD;
rap ily draining his glass, and looking angiously at the&#xD;
disappearing bottle which the attendant was putingback&#xD;
upon the shelf- At a gesture from Reviere it was however&#xD;
replaced withiit their reach, and pouring out a largo&#xD;
quantity into the emptied tumbler, he sd:-" My dear Sir&#xD;
you drank my toast with such hearty good-mill that I nust&#xD;
not only thank you, but beg that you will again drink&#xD;
success to our young friend.'" Nothing loth, it was a second&#xD;
time emptied -while Reviere's first glss just touched&#xD;
his lips, and Charley's had been merely tested&#xD;
Perhaps, as you ,have seen much of the world, and&#xD;
are a man of experience -.--continued the tempter, addres-&#xD;
sing Mr. West in a deferential manner:-"you would be&#xD;
willing to aid us by your advice. Our friend is young-&#xD;
and I "-he hesitated; and a shadow rested for a moment&#xD;
upon his countenance, as his youth-time like a ghost came&#xD;
back to visit him ;-but, soon, his face grew even sterner&#xD;
than it was before, and his voice, if possible, seemed a shade&#xD;
blander in its tones, as he continued:--" Lalways respect&#xD;
the wisdom of grey-hairs." Then, turning to the attendant&#xD;
at the bar, he said: "Will you'be kind enough to give us&#xD;
a bottle of your very best-.with glasses for three-and in&#xD;
a box where we may be entirely private?"&#xD;
The order was obeyed with alacrity, and in. .few&#xD;
minutes, Charleyand his friend were seated on oneside, and&#xD;
Mr. West on the other, of a box table. The curtain was&#xD;
shut to, and the jet of -gas withinside was lighted. A&#xD;
bottle and glasses were before them and within convenient&#xD;
reach of the party.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7578-00000022"/>&#xD;
Liquor was again   poured out-and some of it&#xD;
drank by Mr. West,.-when Reviere reniarked :-"Our&#xD;

in which Ihe was born andwhere, until latly, he lived-.&#xD;

sneer-" Poor fellowi- he takes it hardt"'-tien, changing&#xD;
his tone quickly, he said: "My dear Sir, you are no longer&#xD;
thirsty, J-see: "-.-and pushed the bottle across the table.&#xD;
"Wheie is the 'house into which he is so anxious to&#xD;
get ?" asked the old man, who, with an steady hand,&#xD;
pouredout some' more liquor.&#xD;
j'It is in Chestnut Street, a few doors from Schuylkill&#xD;
Eighthon the sgth sideof the way-"-and is a very hand-&#xD;

"WhereMrs Van Osten lives '?he again asked, as a&#xD;
gleam of cunning played for' moment .about his imbecile&#xD;
features.&#xD;
"Yes.   Do'you know the hwse? "&#xD;
" My daughter sews there sometimes. She is at work&#xD;
for her this afternoon."&#xD;
This senteitious reply fell'like a bomb-shell into the&#xD;
council--and there was'a p4se;r-egoh heard the breathing&#xD;
of the Qthez. Charley half lifted up his head and looked&#xD;
furtivelyt one, and then at the other face near him-&#xD;
Revieretat length broke the silence, and in a very low tone&#xD;
said: " Could 'nt you manage to call upon your daughter&#xD;

poured into the glasses.&#xD;
-Mr. West, thought for: a little while-and then&#xD;
stretching out his trembling fingers clutched  at the&#xD;
gold, which, as he touched it, seemed 'to impart strength&#xD;
to his purpose, while his lips moved, and the two caught&#xD;
at the faint sounds which were breathed rather than&#xD;

ON that same foggy afternoon to which I have alluded&#xD;
-and also ab6ut four o'clock-there sat in a large pleasant&#xD;
chamber, beside a Fraiklin stove, in which a bright fie&#xD;
was burning, old Nii's. Randolph. A  nll table, covered&#xD;
wi Jh bright worsteds, stood i front of the large 'arm-chair&#xD;
she occupiede-one of that bi 6ld-fashioned ind stufed&#xD;
so snugly that you could fall asleep in it; and fancy your-&#xD;
self in bed ;-and so capacious, that in just' such many a&#xD;
little baby is said to hav  narrowly escaped being crushed-&#xD;
to death as it was laid upon the seat to kick and stretch its&#xD;
'limbs, by 'the sitting down of an incautious visitor- who&#xD;
did not'carr y.eyes behind 'as well as- i front. She was&#xD;
introducing into some beautiful form of rotchet-work the&#xD;
various coloured threads before her,' intending it as a.&#xD;
simple bridal-gift for the orphan niece of the rich Mrs..&#xD;
Van''Osten, whos9 niajagrie was t tike place in a fe4 days&#xD;

The old lady was little changed since the time, three&#xD;
years ago, she was first presented to our readers. She&#xD;
looked up occasionally at the mantel clock to see how time&#xD;
progressed-for, when not engaged in court-business, her&#xD;
son always spent an hour or two with her after dinner.&#xD;
His boarding-house was close to his office and, although&#xD;
not living in the'same house whee his mother visited, he&#xD;
did all that affectioniate solicitide coild, to make her sojourn&#xD;
as pleasant as possible.&#xD;
Her,ear caught his well kown- atep on the staira, and,&#xD;
with a iad smile she bade hirn terxas ie tlyr trnocked&#xD;
at the door. There had ,bethilieady a chair which she&#xD;
knew he loved to sit iun placed for him. near her side and&#xD;
pleasantly situated as regarded the ire. Oh how delightful&#xD;
to both of them eeemed the little race of time they were&#xD;
Ito spend together l alone by themselves.&#xD;
An hour f eQnversatiengassed as a few minutes, and&#xD;
he told her of several new ases le had in hand, and which&#xD;
hp hoped to gain, and how he was going to manage them;&#xD;
and she listened and thought " how sensible he was;" an&#xD;
"9 what an ornament he would be to his profession, and ho&#xD;
-some day he would be looked up to and respected!"  nd&#xD;
then, the old longing for the time to come when they tw&#xD;
eould, in one home, live always together, came back upon&#xD;
hr poor heart so that she could scarcely keep from weeping.&#xD;
And, as she ganced up at -his face, it seemed to her he&#xD;
looked paler and thinner than he used to   4. "Oh itdoes&#xD;
take a long while for a young lawyer to make his way in&#xD;

At that moment a servant came into the room to say,&#xD;
"That a boy at the door was asking for Mr. Randolph, and&#xD;

Reviere took froni his p6ket a arkilantern which he&#xD;
lighted, and ,then abur  of keys with some strange&#xD;
looking instr ments.&#xD;

Charley, who got ufind.did- as he was bidden.&#xD;
The sideboatd sa inthe-back parlour andthe' folding&#xD;
doors between the tw-roonis had been left half-open. With-&#xD;
out ffnving them further they went into that room. A&#xD;
number of pieces of plate were set out upon it :-two&#xD;
'arge silver pitchers several cake baskets, and a whole tea-&#xD;
set which was arranged on a massive'waiter,-all of 'which&#xD;
were chased elaborately.  As Reviere's eyes glanced&#xD;
over the  display, he sarcastically muttered,  It is a&#xD;
pitygthey took somuch troubleto ornament them as they&#xD;
will soon be melted up !' --The solid stuff is what we want ;"&#xD;
and,turning to his companion, he added-" But-let us get the&#xD;
little things out first. Holdthe light justdso I' Being obeyed,&#xD;
with a dextrous hand the door-lock was soon overcome.&#xD;
The capacious closet underneath revealed dozen after&#xD;
dozen of spoons and forks, among which, conspicuously ar-&#xD;
ranged in a cut-glass receiver, was.a dozen and a half solid&#xD;
gold tea-spoons. .At the sight of these Reviere: uttered a&#xD;
suppressed exclamation of joy, immediately secreting&#xD;
them upon his own person. . They then commenepd' packing&#xD;
the articles in baskets, several of which were procu-ed from&#xD;
the closet which had been Charley's hiding place. They&#xD;

THE PRINTER"s DAUGHTER R.                79&#xD;
walked about softly as mice,  taiting at every noise&#xD;
they made ;--and Reviere, at the least rattling of the- pre-&#xD;
cious ware, cursing every now and then in an underbreath,&#xD;
the "jingling things! "&#xD;
Their plan was to get off through the back-door and&#xD;
the yard into George Street--and be away with'their booty.&#xD;
Thelast basket was filled, and Reviee was lifting the huge&#xD;
waiter cautiously from the sideboard, when Oharleyi with a&#xD;
face paleal death, cried out, "Look there! oh !-oh!--"&#xD;
pointing towards the other parlour,' where, between the&#xD;
folding doors, stAod Mrs. Van Osten in her night-dress,&#xD;
looking undismayed at-the two burglars. She was leaning&#xD;
on her cane: and now, raising it, said, "Sirs,-that property&#xD;
is not yours that you are disturbing! " There was not'a&#xD;
tremble in her voice, and-it sounded' out clear and distinct&#xD;
upon the dead silence of the' night.&#xD;
Reviere himself was for' the momerit dismayed, and&#xD;
Charley cowered back into a corner of the room unable to&#xD;
stand. But the former, recovering himself, looked up&#xD;
towards' her defiantly, and replied --" But it shall be, old&#xD;
woman, despite of all that you can do!"&#xD;
"No: "-and she shook her 'head solemnly-"it shall&#xD;
not be! unless you walk over my dead body., Murder is&#xD;
a dreadful thing ;-even if it be that of a grey head."&#xD;
Reviere, menacingly, approached her. But she stood&#xD;
unmoved as a rook, and when within almost arm's reach of&#xD;
her he stopped: "Iwill have that booty,or I will be--&#xD;
and a knife gleamed in ,his hand as he drew it from-his&#xD;
bosom to strike at her:, while she, with her cane, feebly&#xD;
parried the blow. A howl!-a leap in the air !--followed&#xD;

When Mr, West and his dau hte start fr home&#xD;
from Mrs    aOsten's door they both felt0sad -At heart.&#xD;
She was not long I observiug that something unusual was&#xD;
on the old man's mind. He was restlessand Wpq1d walk&#xD;
on a-head of her  d ad then look furtively behind him as&#xD;
she came up as if afraid of pursuit. She 4did ot know what&#xD;
it meant and. feared she knew not what calamity was in&#xD;
store for them.. His calling to for her was unusual, but&#xD;
she did not like to ask him, Wi he had dome? fearing&#xD;
to hurt his feelings,; and that he might suppose she was&#xD;
mortified at his having done so.&#xD;
She was. anxious too, about her other father, old Mr.&#xD;
Brown.,  Le had been sick the greater part of the agnmer&#xD;
and did not appear to be getting any better but much&#xD;
weaker, as the cool weather came on. She had not seen&#xD;
him for several days and thought that to night,'after tea, she&#xD;
would certainly: att him. When they got-home she found&#xD;
a message for her stating that he "was very mich worse,&#xD;
and that he wanted to se her as, soon apoggil&#xD;
Rapidly preparing her father's supper, she tArted for&#xD;
his house, but had scarcely walked the length of a square&#xD;
when she heard some ontealling at der, and,4urnig&#xD;
round, saw through the fog Mr. West rapidly following.&#xD;
"Jizzieyou must take me too: I eano stay at home&#xD;

they hiriied'n at a quick pace.&#xD;
When the' arrived at Mr. Brown's they found him,&#xD;
indeed, very ill. He was propped up in bed-his face was&#xD;
nearly as white as the pillows upoi which he ested. Miss&#xD;
West saw at.aAglance that his 'hours were numbered: 'Oh!&#xD;
how desolate, would she be without him. With a composed&#xD;
face, however, she came up t the bedside, and 'said, "My&#xD;
cear friend,why did I not know sooner you were worse?&#xD;
My first duty would have been to attend pn you."&#xD;

left the chamber in search of him, As a ehij follow  its&#xD;
mother, so he, the wretched old man in his hour of trouble&#xD;
child-like, followed her. She had scarcely entered the room&#xD;
down stairs, where' Mr. Randolph was, and tremblingly&#xD;
seated herself on the settee, when he, haggard-looking, also&#xD;
opened the door and came in after her. he motiqned him&#xD;
to a seat, and, making a strenuous effort, said&#xD;
" Mr. Randolph, I have something very dreadful to tll&#xD;
you. My father has just made me aware -that a robbery&#xD;
is to be attempted to night at Mrs. Van Osten's,. Can it&#xD;
not be frustrated?"&#xD;
The young lawyer started :--but, his profssiepal, cool-&#xD;

then taking out his watch, "It is now twenty-five miutes&#xD;
past twelve. I will niake use ofd the wagon at the door,&#xD;
and no doubt we shall. be in time. Mr. West," turning&#xD;
to the dismayed-looking man, "you will have to go with&#xD;
me; and-as. we tide:along, you cani give me all the particu-&#xD;
Iars of .the5 affair."&#xD;
The old man's alarm. at the proposition was so mani-&#xD;
fest that Randolph found it would be necessary to quiet his&#xD;
apprehensions; and he endeavored to .do ,so, although he&#xD;
disliked, before the daughter, to =evince any suspicion of&#xD;
her father's complicity with the felony.. He said to-him, in&#xD;
that calm "sort of tone which carries so iueh force along&#xD;
with it.-It is imperative that you'go along. No possible&#xD;
harm can happen-to you if you do. Much harm may be&#xD;
consequent upon your not going, and refusing to assist me&#xD;
by givingall the information you possess. Will get my hat&#xD;
at once. -There is a large old cloak lying alongside the bed,&#xD;
up-stairs, which you had best wrap around you, for the&#xD;
night is very damp and chilly."&#xD;
In a few minutes the noisy vehicle in which sat the two&#xD;
men was waking up restless sleepers all along the-line-of&#xD;
its travel to the police station nearest to the house of Mrs.&#xD;
Van Osten.&#xD;
It did not take Theodore-Randolph long to get at all&#xD;
Mr. West knew of the affair, and by the time they reached&#xD;
the end of their ride he was enabled to make such a state-&#xD;
ment to the Lieutenant of Police, without implicating his&#xD;
companion, that a force was immediately despatched to the&#xD;
neighborhood of Mrs. Van Osten's house.-with what result,&#xD;

kept the information 'to htself; hoping. out of it to make&#xD;

could be no kind of doubt ;-but whether it would be beet&#xD;
to arrest him was the question about which information&#xD;
and counsel Was desired, to enable her to decide.&#xD;
Mrs. Van Osten said, 'sorrowfully  "she felt con-&#xD;
demned at the thought that she had not heretofore acted&#xD;
towards the poor youth-as a kind relative should, have&#xD;

explained to her that it was "the easiesithing in theworld&#xD;

"that even the publicity of the arrest mightbe avoided.&#xD;

and then cautiously made his wAy qut,,Of jt, and the back&#xD;

and got some rolls of bread, for he was faint with hunger.&#xD;
After he had eaten them he came againinto the street, but&#xD;
he did not know where to go. -'Oh, how, thirsty he was!-&#xD;
heMustget something to drink ;.-and he went in at a&#xD;
tavern- door, which stood on the corner just before him.&#xD;
Each; act--and almost eachmotive that influenced .him-.&#xD;
was noted by the watchful eye of the man who, himself&#xD;
all unobserved, was on his track.&#xD;
It wasonUtside this tavern that they now found the&#xD;
policeman, apparently lounging away his timo and going&#xD;
every now and then into the bar room to look over the,&#xD;
newspapers, or to take a drink with a friend. They&#xD;
beckoid to'himf as-they drove up and conferred together for&#xD;

very sorrowful. That he had drink -ut little; and he&#xD;
couldn't help pitting the 'poor devil!' "&#xD;

and he would be well paid for it;-then to bring the prisoner&#xD;
immediately to the carriage, the door ofwhich would be&#xD;
left ropen, but that tey would go into the tavern first&#xD;
themselves, as if to get something, and he was to com  in&#xD;
after them. They would join him and the prisoner in the&#xD;
carriage afterwards, and drive together to the, house&#xD;
of 1rs. Van Osten.",&#xD;
They went in 'nd walked up to the;bar. Charley was&#xD;
sitting on a ,tool with a Pewspaper hewas not reading,&#xD;
before him., He started when the door opened and looked&#xD;
as if he was going to run. A minute afterwards another&#xD;
door, which was on the side of the room, was opened by the&#xD;
officer who walked straight up to him. The young man fied&#xD;
his eyes on him with a horrified gaze, and they dilated wider&#xD;
in terror, as he approached. The man held out the warrant&#xD;
and said, In a low voice, "Charles Wood, I.arrest you in&#xD;
the name of the Commonwealth." He sprang up, upsetting&#xD;
the stool on which he had been sittingdeaped upn its legs&#xD;
as it lay horizontally on the floor, and brandished a stick in&#xD;
his hand, which he had caught at, as if in defence, It was&#xD;
but a momentary ebullition. 'e then sank down overcome&#xD;
on a seat, aid, -leaning his head upon a table, gave himself&#xD;
up to utter despair.&#xD;
It was all over so soon, that an hour' had nt passed&#xD;
from the time- they had left Mrs. Van Osten's before th&#xD;
were back again. The guilty man could scarcely get up the&#xD;
steps-- his knees smote together under himand he looked&#xD;

There were two new graves opened in the church-yard&#xD;
-each on either side of thespot where lay Lucy Ashton,&#xD;
West; - in one was deposited all that was recovered-&#xD;
from  the fire of her iisband-and, into the other was-&#xD;
lowered the body of, Daniel Brown. The old hunter slept&#xD;
where head wished to be uried.&#xD;
In the little back room, with its low ceiling and home-&#xD;
ly but' comfortable furiture, were assembled several of the&#xD;
persons of our Narrative after the funeral was over, to hear&#xD;
the reading of the will of Mr. Brown. Old Mrs. Ran-.&#xD;
dolph had attended 'it because Theodore wished her to do so,&#xD;
and the sorrowful face of the beautiful girl who wept for&#xD;
her two fathers, and.whom he loved, won its way at once to&#xD;
the mother's heart. 'She kindly ministered to her grief,&#xD;
and found half the pang of her disappointment was already&#xD;
over. She sat in the old BostE-rocking-chair.-.-which,&#xD;
cushioned, is one 'of the most comfortable seats that has&#xD;
yet been devised-and, on the settee beside her was the&#xD;
orphan girl.' The store boy and the nurse, with Mr. Ran-&#xD;
dolph, completed the' company.&#xD;
He took a key from his pocket, unlocked alarge escri-&#xD;
toir, half-bureau and half-desk, that stood' in the room,&#xD;
and produced therefrom, for the first time, the will. Judg-'&#xD;
ing what its contents would be from the words the dying&#xD;
man had spoken, he had not, before, looked over it. He now&#xD;
commenced giving it his serious attention. After he had&#xD;
read a few lines of it to' himself a look of wonder spread&#xD;
over his face and, with a trembling hand he picked up&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
from the desk a Parchment Paper which had fallen from&#xD;
the'. envelope.  Suiprise, the  most' profound, -then&#xD;
wrote itself upon every 'line of his countenance.  He&#xD;
looked again at the will ;-ran his eye a secondhand a&#xD;
third time over the parchment F--referred to other papers&#xD;
contained in the or-iginal envelope.--and, pressing his hand&#xD;
nervously up to his- forehead thought earnestly, and,&#xD;
for some time longer, was silent.' At length he seemed&#xD;
to have come to a conclusion, rose up from his seat, and&#xD;
walked to where his mother 'was sitting, and close to the&#xD;
settee,&#xD;
&#xD;
"Miss West, I find, to my great surprise, by this will&#xD;
and these documents that you are one of the largest heir-&#xD;
esses in the country!"&#xD;
She raised her eyes to meet his inquiringly, and in&#xD;
wonder ;-he continued:--" A tract of land-as a farm&#xD;
Mr. Brown bought and once worked it-has grown' into&#xD;
immense value. It lies within the bounds of the city of&#xD;
Cincinnati, Ohio. It is all unbuilt upon, but streets run&#xD;
through it;. and the taxe have been regularly paid up, so&#xD;
that the title is unimpaired ;-several building lots appear&#xD;
to 'have been sold from time to time, to furnish sums for&#xD;
that purpose; and to all this property you are the&#xD;
undoubted and indisputable heiress."&#xD;
Her face worked 'all over convulsively ;-and then,&#xD;
stretching her hand out towards her informant, she said':&#xD;
iray   od ive both of us wisdom to use this wealth' aright,&#xD;
for the happiness of' others, and our own good&#xD;

hysterically laughed and cried  but as soon as her feelings.&#xD;

"The Lottery Ticket, or The Forlorn [ope ;" is in our judgment,&#xD;
after a perusal of the proof sheets, the title of one of the, most captivating&#xD;
and affecting stories we have ever read. We have to thank its talented&#xD;
author not only for the intellectual and sentimental treat which he has fur-&#xD;
nished us; but more especially, because more important, for the contribu-&#xD;
tion to sound public anorals, which the work affords. Son of the scenes&#xD;
of harrowing poverty and anguish will touch the heart and draw the test&#xD;
from all who sympathize with the sufferings andaorrqws of the poor,though&#xD;
increased, in this instance, ten-fold, by that foul and pernicious spirit of&#xD;
lottery gambling, which is here laid bare, while the hypocrisy and sancti-&#xD;
monious pretensions of, the heartless speculator in the sufferings of others,&#xD;
and the brilliant episodes of extravagance and fashion, mark this as one of&#xD;
the most dramatic and effective books of the day. Philadelphia Topic.&#xD;
Qamden Democrat.&#xD;
We have read this recent publication twice, and with the deepest&#xD;
interest. The descriptions are graphic; the language of the book excel-&#xD;
lent; and the whole story powerful in expression and full of pathos. The&#xD;
author is not unknown to the world of letters; and has told a touching&#xD;
lastt too true) story, an4 one that will be remembered by every reader&#xD;
for its sorrowful truth, and its beautiful delineation of the gentler shades&#xD;
of character.&#xD;
Let every reader of the Democrat buy this book, and he will not accuse&#xD;
us of exaggerating in its praise.&#xD;

The   following   noticee  of   " THE   LOTTERY     TwKET"&#xD;
was received     by  its publisher     from   DOCTOR    REYNELL&#xD;
COATES, 4 short time After the iSue of the first edition&#xD;
of the work:&#xD;
"The downward tendency of that species of literature, if such it can&#xD;
be called, with which, in shilling or two, shilling doses, the masses of&#xD;
American readers are now continually flooded awakens keen regret in the&#xD;
minds of all the true friends of society. - Not a few philanthopists would be&#xD;
glad to see it altogether suppressed, in view of the 'terrible demoralization&#xD;
of whichit is the parent; but, this is impossible. The insatiable appe-&#xD;
tite of twenty prolific millions wid be gratified, and, in the absence of&#xD;
healthful food, will seize upon the poisons.  Reform, then, difficult as it&#xD;
may be, not destruction, should be the object of those who would correct&#xD;
the. evil. * This consideration has. given to,:this unpretending story an&#xD;
importance in our eyes, to Which, otherwise, it m eight not. have attained.,&#xD;
While utterly' divested of objectionablee thouglht'or description, it enchains&#xD;
the attention and aiouses the sympathies of the Romance reader to an&#xD;
extent that must render it highly popular, and we are not'surprised that a&#xD;
second editioli follows the first after an interval of a very few- days. , The&#xD;
tale presents a deeply affecting picture of domestic distress and ruin, resulting&#xD;
from one of the worst curses of society, and the principal incidents, while&#xD;
sternly truthful are rendered startling and dramatic to a degree that fully&#xD;
warrants the proud nom de plume which the author has seen fit to assume.&#xD;
The moral 1is0mostexcellent, and the tendency practical so that we hope&#xD;
to see it followed by miny other stories from the same able pen, and cheer-&#xD;
fully, recommend i1830o the real friends of their species, as a pioneer in the&#xD;
important work of rendering that .most powerful lever, popular romance,&#xD;
an instrument of moral advancement instead of degradation."&#xD;

&#xD;
THE CHRISTIAN OnszRvzn, or PHILA., says of it :-" In a very inter-&#xD;
esting story of some ninety pages' handsomely printed in large type the&#xD;
author delineates the pernicious effects of th  system of lotteries which, in&#xD;
defiance of law, are destroying the peace of many families in every part of&#xD;
the country. * * * *  It is highly commended by literary critics.&#xD;
THE DoLLAR NEWSPAPER says :--" The Lottery Ticket; or, the For-&#xD;
lorn Hope, by Paul Richter, is the title of a pamphlet volume covering&#xD;
an interesting and affecting story of the times, the whole .being liberally&#xD;

coed in winning over any of the many confirmed lottery gamblers, -he will&#xD;
not have written without his reward; for of all crimes not openly con-&#xD;
demned, this is the most seductive and impoverishing."&#xD;

The following." WAAT LoTTERIElS Do,'-has been clipped by us&#xD;
from a late number of t6e PREsBYTERANi and, as it bears 5o relevantly on&#xD;
the subject, we here insert it&#xD;
Ten persons engagbd in thle sale of lottery tickets were arrested in&#xD;
Cincinnati, Ohio, lately. 'The Gazette says :-The affidavits upon which&#xD;
warrants were issued for these parties were all made by Frederick Toden-&#xD;
bier, a German mechanic, who relates his experience in the lottery business&#xD;
with emotions  He says he has been purchasing tickets for years-that&#xD;
he has spent all he earned, and all he could borrow, in these ruinous&#xD;
speculations-that he has impoverished himself and family to such a degree&#xD;
that they have frequently had to live upon a single meal a day, and that of&#xD;
the most scanty character; in short, that he had become almost a maniac&#xD;
upon the subject of drawing a prize, and at last getting his hard-earned&#xD;
money back.  He has been driven to the verge of despair and destruction,&#xD;
and having become convinced of the wide-spread ruin which the lottery&#xD;
business is inflicting upon the community, is determined to do his utmost&#xD;
to break it up. Todenbier assures the officers that there is at least a&#xD;
hundred within the circle of his own acquaintance, who are daily spending&#xD;
their earnings in the vain hope of eventually drawing a fortune."&#xD;

Mon LOTTERY BusnEss.     We take the following slip from TnE&#xD;
UNITED STATES' GAZETTE AND NouTH AmERoiAN.       "A young man,&#xD;
named Benneville Kline, in the employ of a broker in this city, was&#xD;
arrested in-the Office of Blood's Dispatch, in Fifth. Street, above Chestnut.&#xD;
The arrest was made upon a warrant issued by the Mayor. A large num-&#xD;
ber of letters directed to the employer of the latter were seized. The&#xD;
youth and the letters were taken before Alderman James B. Freeman,&#xD;
where the prisoner underwent an examination, and the letters were opened.&#xD;
It seems that the young man, who was .arrested, was in the employ of a&#xD;
certain firm in this city, and that the said firm is heavily engaged in the&#xD;
sale of tickets for the Delaware and Maryland Lotteries. The correspond-&#xD;
ence between the firm and its agents has been carried on through the&#xD;
medium of Blood's Dispatch, and the returns from these agents were in&#xD;
the letters seized, as above stated.  *  *  *    Some of the letters&#xD;
had attached to them the autographs of members of the bar; and others,&#xD;
who would not like to see their names figure in print in connection with&#xD;
the vending of lottery tickets.  *  *    *    *     Michael Kline,&#xD;
the father, was subsequently arrested at his office, in Race Street, above&#xD;
Third. They were held in $2000 bail each to answer. The principals in&#xD;
the business are not yet taken.&#xD;
