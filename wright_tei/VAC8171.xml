CHAPTER I.&#xD;
"We will thank Heaven&#xD;
And then we'll see maskery."&#xD;
In Catholic countries the Carnival time, es-&#xD;
pecially the week immediately preceding the&#xD;
advent of Lent, is devoted to Social enjoyments&#xD;
-balls, parties, theatres and the like enter-&#xD;
tainments are indulged in by almost the entire&#xD;
population. it comes in the early spring of the&#xD;
year, and the pleasures of the winter season&#xD;
are now brought to a brilliant termination,&#xD;
preparatory to the commencement of that sea-&#xD;
son of austerity, observed by the "children of&#xD;
the Churcl~ ~ as a reminder of their own weak-&#xD;
ness, and to bring them to a proper feeling of&#xD;
humility in contemplating the life and suffer-&#xD;
ings of H~mn~ who assumed our weak humanity,&#xD;
who fasted and was sorely tempted, that we,&#xD;
through his example, might gather strength to&#xD;
pass through the troubles and cares of this&#xD;
world with a fortitude and resignation worthy&#xD;
of His name.&#xD;
In no oth~r part 9f our own country, are the&#xD;
ceremonies of the Carnival so well observed&#xD;
and heartily enjoyed as in New Orleans, where&#xD;
a large majority of the people are of the Ca-&#xD;
tholic faith and where there is also yet a very&#xD;
strong element of the French or "Credo" in&#xD;
the population, who have given to the place&#xD;
many of the customs of the mother country,&#xD;
customs which their fellow citizens of other&#xD;
nationalities are not slow in imitating, or im-&#xD;
proving upon, and fully enjoy.&#xD;
Mardi Gras, a French term sign Fat&#xD;
Tuesday, is the last day of the season of pleas-&#xD;
ure, and is always marked by the wildest&#xD;
scenes of gaiety, and is given over to amuse-&#xD;
&#xD;
ment by almost the entire population of the&#xD;
Crescent City. In the Church the day is known&#xD;
as Shrove Tuesday, being the day on which,&#xD;
in olden time, the faithful were wont to wake&#xD;
their shrift, preparatory to "receiving the&#xD;
ashes" on the following day, Ash Wednesday,&#xD;
thus entering the season of fasting and prayer&#xD;
with propc~ humility and devotion.&#xD;
In a quie~ cottage, in what was then the&#xD;
"far up to n" district of New Orleans, many&#xD;
years ago, ~lr. George Macourty resided. A&#xD;
neat open fence enclosed the front of the&#xD;
grounds, though which the passer-by was&#xD;
tempted to pause and look at the graveled&#xD;
walks boarded with beds of violets, with a col-&#xD;
lection of choice roses, the beautiful camelia,&#xD;
and fragrant magnolia. A few feet retired&#xD;
from the street, with a small grass plot inter-&#xD;
vening, was the house, with a wide gallery in&#xD;
front ~nd along the side. There was not only&#xD;
an air of quiet comfort about the place, but&#xD;
a degree of beauty and elegance that gave evi-&#xD;
dence that the owner was on the road to op-&#xD;
pulence and wealth.&#xD;
George Macourty was a commission ruer-&#xD;
chant, whose principal correspondents were&#xD;
English, from whom he received large consign-&#xD;
ments of ale, porter, whiskey and other ar-&#xD;
ticles of foreign make in that line of trade. He&#xD;
had now been established for himself about&#xD;
five years, his predecessor having retired from&#xD;
business just before the crash of '37.&#xD;
Mr. Macourty was a young man, of medium&#xD;
height, with light hair, and an open, good na-&#xD;
tured countenance. A man of good education,&#xD;
business talents of a high order, and a private&#xD;
character of honor and integrity, he was al-,&#xD;

ready considered one of the most prominent&#xD;
citizens of the place. H~s wife, see Cecelia&#xD;
Mary Christie, a native of the north of Ireland,&#xD;
was a lady of superior education, brilliant ac-&#xD;
complishments, and refined tastes. She was&#xD;
taif and dignified in appearance, with large,&#xD;
bright, black eyes, an abundance of glossy&#xD;
hair, black as the raven's wing, and a face that&#xD;
was full of intelligence and radiant with rare&#xD;
beauty.&#xD;
Th~y were devotedly attached to each other,&#xD;
and were loved and respected by a large circle&#xD;
dif friends. During the morning meal Mr. Ma-&#xD;
courty was persuading his wife to attend the&#xD;
Mardi Gras ball, to which she half consented.&#xD;
After breakfast she accompanied her hus-&#xD;
band as usual to the front gallery, to say good&#xD;
bye to him when he was leaving for the day's&#xD;
business. As they stood there he said;&#xD;
"Well, Cecelia, 1 think you had better go.&#xD;
It will be a splendid ball, McDonald and his&#xD;
wife, MacVain, even old Mr. Cummings will&#xD;
be there, and I know you will enjoy it."&#xD;
"But the baby, George? I think you forget&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"No indeed, I do not," he replied smiling,&#xD;
"but stirely Aunt Lott4r ca~.i look after her."&#xD;
"Just as you like, my dear," his wife re-&#xD;
plied, "I know Lotty ~Yill take good care of&#xD;
her."&#xD;
The patter of little feet wa~ heard behind&#xD;
them, and a bright little child of two years&#xD;
ran from the side gallery and with a cry of joy&#xD;
caught her father's hand.&#xD;
"Papa go? Papa store? Ceely go I" said&#xD;
the child.&#xD;
"Kiss papa, good bye," he said, bending&#xD;
over her, and putting back the long, hiringg&#xD;
curls that half hid her bright, animated face,&#xD;
while the child, with a merry laugh, turned&#xD;
her rosy lips to him.&#xD;
"Kiss mamma-kiss Ceely," said the child,&#xD;
and he playfully obeyed.&#xD;
"You will go to-night, Cecelia ?"&#xD;
"Yes, dear."&#xD;
"I will not come home until six," he said&#xD;
"and then I will not go back in the evening&#xD;
but we will get ready for the ball."&#xD;
As he turned to go, a gentleman passing by&#xD;
with a polite bow and friendly smile, said&#xD;
"Good~morning." lie was a tall man, witl&#xD;
broad shoulders, a full, well developed chest&#xD;
and limbs in such J)erfect proportion as mad~&#xD;
him an observed and admired figure. his hair&#xD;
&#xD;
(IJL4S;          __________&#xD;
&#xD;
closely trimmed, was of so (lark a red that in&#xD;
these days of polite description it would be&#xD;
called auburn. his face was full, with high&#xD;
cheek bones, while a smile that lingered&#xD;
around his closed mouth was a mixture of&#xD;
good nature and sarcasm, leaving the beholder&#xD;
in doubt whether to encourage or avoid the&#xD;
acquaintance. Such was Percy MacVain, a&#xD;
man of wealth and education, a native of ire-&#xD;
hind, who since his business l,,id ~allcd him to&#xD;
New Orle~n~ had been one of the leaders in&#xD;
social as wefi as commercial affairs.&#xD;
"Why, Mac, what are you doing up here I"&#xD;
~~id Macourty, "conic in, conic in, I'm glad to~&#xD;
see you."&#xD;
"Thank you, George," said the other, as he&#xD;
walked up to the gallery. "how are yell,&#xD;
Mrs. Macourty? and how's my sweet-heart ~"&#xD;
he said, stooping to kiss the baby. "how do&#xD;
you do, darling?"&#xD;
"Ceely's well," the child replied.&#xD;
"1 was just looking around this morning&amp;amp;&#xD;
0~&#xD;
said MacVain, when the other had answered&#xD;
his salutations. "I think it would be a good&#xD;
idea to buy some property in this neigl~bor-&#xD;
hood-I mean it would be a good investment."&#xD;
"Not only that," replied Macourty, "but it&#xD;
will be a good place for a future residence."&#xD;
"Au old bachelor," said MacVain, the smile&#xD;
deepening on his face, "has no nie for any&#xD;
such provision."&#xD;
"You are claiming to be an old bachelor too&#xD;
soon," Mrs. Macourty said good naturedly, "in&#xD;
the old eo!mutry a man of thirty like you, is&#xD;
only a right smart lad."&#xD;
"Well, if I am not an ohP bachelor now, I&#xD;
soon will be," he replied, "especially in this&#xD;
country. But I must be getting down town,&#xD;
although as this is Mardi Gras day, I suppose&#xD;
there will be little business doing. Do you. go&#xD;
to the ball to-night I"&#xD;
"I think we will go," replied Macourty, as&#xD;
he repeated his good byes to his wife and baby,&#xD;
and prepared to accompany his friend to the&#xD;
business part of the city.&#xD;
During the day there were a large number of&#xD;
people walking the street in mask, but the&#xD;
greater portion of them mere young men or&#xD;
boys. These generally carried bags of flour,&#xD;
from which 'they sprinkled the passers by,&#xD;
without much respect for persons.&#xD;
In the afternoon Mrs. Macourty took a seat&#xD;
~ on the front gallery, watching the few mask.&#xD;
ers, who strayed away from the principal part&#xD;

~he was a small lady, mild and pleasant, with&#xD;

her welcome in every circle. Her health was&#xD;

her, lest somethingg should happen. This&#xD;
caused herself and her husband to spend much&#xD;
of their time in traveling.&#xD;
"I thought you had taken orders and retired&#xD;
from the world," said Mrs. McDonald, as he&#xD;
finished rehearsing the usual excuses for not&#xD;
calling before.&#xD;
"Not yet~, Mrs. McDonald," ho replied.&#xD;
"I knew that if you were in love, it must&#xD;
have been with some of our Protestant belles 1"&#xD;
continued the lady.&#xD;
"And why did you think that I" he asked.&#xD;
"Because I never see you in church," replied&#xD;
)frs. McDonald. "It must be i~early three&#xD;
years since you were at St. Patrick's."&#xD;
"Not quite so long," he replied, an~oycd at&#xD;
the mention of church, "Yet I am proud that&#xD;
my absence has been noticed 1"&#xD;
"Yes. I have heard some of our young la-&#xD;
dies," she said, "wondering where Mr. Percy&#xD;
MacVaIn kept him~ielf."&#xD;
"My thank~ are due to the ladies for their&#xD;
kind interest in my welfare," he replied, "and&#xD;
as an evidence of my appreci~rtion of their&#xD;
good will, I shall be more social in future."&#xD;
"Now that is well said, and as a further&#xD;
proof of your desire to please, you should give&#xD;
us a wedding."&#xD;
"But where shall I find a partner I" he in-&#xD;
quired.&#xD;
"Why, there is Miss Lucy Morton, how would&#xD;
she do?"&#xD;
"A beautiful lady, tall and commanding in&#xD;
appearance," was the ironical reply.&#xD;
"Bducutcd and refined," continued the lady.&#xD;
"Just from the Louisville refinery," said he.&#xD;
"Rich, and of good family," Mrs.. McDonald&#xD;
continued. "Plenty of money, and of illustri-&#xD;
ous ancestry," he sarcastically replied, "her fa-&#xD;
ther was a shoemaker and her-"&#xD;
"Why Mr. MacVain 1" exclaimed the aston-&#xD;
* ished lady.&#xD;
"Is it not so I" he replied, and then to give&#xD;
a gloss of good hu~!or to his remarks he said,&#xD;
"American aristocracy, you know, Mrs. Mc-&#xD;
Donald, the coat of arms-a shoemaker's hench&#xD;
or a tinker's furnace, with a bow of wooden&#xD;
u utm egs."&#xD;
&#xD;
"This, is a republican country~" replied the&#xD;
lady with dignity, "and we have no si~ch proud&#xD;
and unjust distinctions here."&#xD;
"No? Well my observations of American so-&#xD;
ciety had led me to Jelieve they were very&#xD;
fond of aristocratic titles and exclusive in&#xD;
their 'sets ~&#xD;
"I pave seen nothing of that kind I" replied&#xD;
the lady.&#xD;
I but you are here, located like a star&#xD;
in y~ur particular circle of society, and you&#xD;
see very little beyond it, but I move through&#xD;
all classes, and there is no country where ti-&#xD;
tles are more cherished than in this, whether&#xD;
it is General, Colonel, Major, Governor or&#xD;
Judge, the title is pertinaciously claimed, and&#xD;
the general tendency amongst the people, is to&#xD;
look down upon their felloWs and exclaim, 'I&#xD;
thank theo Oh! Lord that I am not as other&#xD;
men!~~~&#xD;
"Really, Mr. MacVain, your long seclusion&#xD;
must have roused your judgment," the lady&#xD;
replied, "you owe it to yourself to be more so-&#xD;
cial in future, and shake off this unnatural bit-&#xD;
terness."&#xD;
"I meant no offense," said ho, "and as you&#xD;
are, like myself, from fair and beautiful An-&#xD;
trim, I did not expect you to champion the&#xD;
American nation."&#xD;
"I have spent many pleasant years here,"&#xD;
replied Mrs. McDonald, "and have met many&#xD;
true friends, therefore, I do not like to hear&#xD;
them unjustly spoken of."&#xD;
"Prosperity always has friends, Mrs. MeDon-&#xD;
aid," ho replied, dropping once more into the&#xD;
cold and sarcastic tone that had of late suited&#xD;
his frame of mind; "money makes respectabil-&#xD;

no matter how rough and uncouth his manner,&#xD;

"That the poorest citizen may by energy and&#xD;
talent rise to the noblest positions," replied.&#xD;
the lady, "is only an evidence of the superior-&#xD;
ity of a true republican government."&#xD;
"Although I cannot endorse your opinions,&#xD;
it would be ungallant in me to try 'to contro-&#xD;
vert them," he replied, "and I suppose the&#xD;
memory of a brilliant season, lends a charik to&#xD;
your views of society here."&#xD;

ChAPTER IV.&#xD;
The Cu~rnings' estate turned out badly. The&#xD;
old gentleman had been for ninny years a&#xD;
leading merchant of New Orleans, and was&#xD;
successful in amassing a very large fortune.&#xD;
Lie was kind and generous almost to a fault;&#xD;
being himself strictly honorable and just, he&#xD;
was confiding in nature and jud~cd every one,&#xD;
to be above deception and fraud. When the&#xD;
financial crisis of '36 and '37 came on, he was&#xD;
in the full tide of prosperity, and his paper&#xD;
belonged to the "gilt edged" class. To him&#xD;
his friends applied' for assistance when in&#xD;
trouble, and he aided them without'stint or&#xD;
limit. To some he loaned money, and for many&#xD;
others he became endorser. Then there came&#xD;
a time when those who met their financial en-&#xD;
gagements were the exc~ptioTh ~o the general&#xD;
rule. As fast as the notes which he had en-&#xD;
dorsed were presented, Mr. Cumming~ paid&#xD;
them, sacrificing, to raise the money, his stock&#xD;
in trade, real estate and everything available.&#xD;
To crown his misfortunes, an intimate friend,&#xD;
interested in some of his business transactions,&#xD;
ran away with nearly a hundred thousand dol-&#xD;
lars and was never heard of afterwards. Be-&#xD;
fore these accumulated disasters, his immense&#xD;
fortune melted away, as rapidly as snow be-&#xD;
neath the sun of June, and so it happened&#xD;
that, after the estate was settled~ nothing was&#xD;
left to his son Philip, but the worthless book&#xD;
accounts and protested notes of his father's&#xD;
once extensive business.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Philip had lived with the family of his uncle ant was a tall, slender man, with long, curling&#xD;
in Brooklyn for three years, during which hair, a light moustache, blue eyes, and a good-&#xD;
time he attended school, and in the leisure looking face. He was a man of dash and gal-&#xD;
hours performed such services about the house lantry, knew how to be attentive and polite,&#xD;
as were required. It very often happens that but had presumption and impudence enough&#xD;
children do not appreciate the kindness of to push himself forward. He was a ready&#xD;
relatives with whoni they are placed, when un- talker, and made whatever assertions suited&#xD;
fortunately bereft of parents, and so it was his purpose, with a bold and decided manner&#xD;
with Philip. The little services that he was thatprevented contradiction, if they did not&#xD;
capable of performing became irksome to him, carry conviction with them.&#xD;
and he began to think ~he was lQoked upon as "Here, Phil.," said Mr. Droll, "run over&#xD;
a servant in his uncle's family. As this feeling the way and tell Bill to send me a paper of to-&#xD;
grew within his heart, he resolved to strike bacco, Anderson's S6lace-and tell him if it is&#xD;

" What was it marked, Pete?"&#xD;
" Sixty cents !"                   .'&#xD;
During this conversation the men had fin-&#xD;
ished their arrangement of stock, and Philip&#xD;
returned with Mr. Droll's tobacco. Mr. Muslin&#xD;
called him to go to the postoffice. ,Going down&#xD;
Grand street to Broadway, he caught on to the&#xD;
rear of a stage going down town, and, keeping&#xD;
out of sight of the driver, rode as far as the&#xD;
Park. He now mingled with the crowd on the&#xD;
street, and, as he passed along, stopped every&#xD;
now and then to' look in the windows. While&#xD;
standing admiringithe jewelry displayed in one&#xD;
of the windows, and speculating on the length&#xD;
of time it would take him to master fortune&#xD;
enough to become the owner of one of the ele-&#xD;
gant watches that tempted his gaze, a gentle-&#xD;
man and lady paused a moment before the win-&#xD;
dow and then passed on. Thelady was a small&#xD;
-person, with a kind and beautiful face, and&#xD;
leaned lovingly on the arm of hier companion,&#xD;
a tall man, with an upright air and a steady&#xD;
step that looked military. His round,full face&#xD;
was covered with a heavy, dark beard, neatly&#xD;
trimmed, his fine grey eyes beamed with good*&#xD;
nature, and his whole appearance denoted that&#xD;
he was a man of wealth, and enjoyed the use&#xD;
of it most when alleviating the wants and suf-&#xD;
ferings of his fellow creatures. As they crossed&#xD;
the street towards the Astor, House, a little&#xD;
girl, with a basket on her arm, accosted them&#xD;
wifth the request, " Please buy some matches,&#xD;
shoe-strings or pins." .She might have been&#xD;
eight years old, certainly not more, a child of&#xD;
slender form, pale and care-worn face, the hag-&#xD;
gard look of which wfts relieved by a pair of&#xD;
large, bright, black eyes. Her hair was black&#xD;
as the raven's wing, and thrown carelessly&#xD;
back, the long, matted locks falling over her&#xD;
shoulders in uncombed disorder. Her face was&#xD;
not handsome, but attractive; possessing a&#xD;
charm that the beholder could not resist when&#xD;
looking upoip, yet for which he could not ac.-&#xD;
count when she had passed out of sight; The&#xD;
lady and gentleman looked kindly at her, and,&#xD;
gently refusing hei wares, went on their way,.&#xD;
In front of the old church below, another little&#xD;
merchant sat with a basket of apples before&#xD;
her. She was apparently about the same age&#xD;
as the one they had just passed. Her form was&#xD;
strong and well developed, a round, smiling&#xD;
&#xD;
face, on which the bloom of the peach and the&#xD;
white of the lily shone out in such proportions&#xD;
as indicated health and gave beauty to the&#xD;
possessor. Her mild, blue eyes were shaded&#xD;
with long, drooping lashes, that, as she looked&#xD;
down, touched the velvet softness of her cheek,&#xD;
and her light, brown hair lay in coquietish&#xD;
ringlets on a broad, fine forehead, or fell in&#xD;
waving abundance from a well shaped head-.&#xD;
The weather was warm, and the sleeve of her&#xD;
neat, calico dress was tucked back, showing a&#xD;
round, well moulded arm, on which the dim-&#xD;
ples came and went as, with care, she dusted&#xD;
and arranged her little stock. The lady&#xD;
paused, and, in the quickness of the movement,&#xD;
brought her compa'nion around, facing the&#xD;
girl, as she exclaimed, " Oh! what nice apples,&#xD;
are they not, Robert 7" i&#xD;
"Very pretty, indeed," replied the gentle-&#xD;
man.   .    .&#xD;
" Will you buy some, madam 7" said the girl,&#xD;
looking up when she spoke. As she looked at&#xD;
her childish face, full of animation ,at the&#xD;
prospect of selling her apples, the lady said,&#xD;
in a low voice, to her companion;:&#xD;
" What splendid eyes, Robert, and a face so&#xD;
innocent and beautiful." ,&#xD;
" A good looking' child," he quietly replied,&#xD;
and then answered the girl by asking the price&#xD;
of the fruit-.&#xD;
" These are five cents a piece," she replied,&#xD;
pointing to one basket, " and these two and&#xD;
three cents."&#xD;
" These are very fine," said the gentleman,&#xD;
stooping over the first basket, " and these are&#xD;
good. Any of them would eat well."&#xD;
" Buy some, Robert," said -the lady, as he&#xD;
stood up again-.&#xD;
" How much will you take for the lobi" said&#xD;
he, smiling as he spoke.&#xD;
"For all of them!I" exclaimed the girl. .&#xD;
" Yes, and to deliver them for 'me, it is no~t&#xD;
far."&#xD;
"I think-well, two dollars and a half-if&#xD;
you please sir." .&#xD;
" You will bring the apples this evening, at&#xD;
five o'clock," said the gentleman, dropping a&#xD;
five dollar gold piece into her hand and giving&#xD;
her a card; " thi-s is my card, Parlor B., Astor&#xD;
House. You can bring me the change, too."&#xD;
"Yes sir, thank you sir," was the reply of&#xD;
the delighted girl.&#xD;
" You can find the place ?"&#xD;
" Oh ! yes sir, I will be there." .&#xD;

tion, with an interest that showed they were " And what would your mother say 7"&#xD;
strangers in the city.                    "I'm 'bliged to you,".- she replied, with a&#xD;
When Philip came to where the apple girl sneer, " but I ain't troubled with anything of&#xD;
sat, he stopped to speak to her, for, in passing that kind."&#xD;
and repassing so many times, there had begun  "Shame to speak so of a mother," said-Philip.&#xD;
an acquaintance between them.          -"Nobody wants any of your gab," said the&#xD;
"Mary, I want an apple," said Philip, offer- girl, "come now, Sis, just you follow my ad-&#xD;
ing her two pennies.    *                vice, go with me to-night and PIl show you&#xD;
"I can't sell you quny now," she replied, with some jolly fun."&#xD;
a smiling, quizzing look.                . "No, I can not, replied Mary, decidedly, "I&#xD;
"Not sell any !" he exclaimed,         would not be so deceitful, besides my mother&#xD;
"No," she replied, laughing at his astonish- would not let me be out at night."&#xD;
&#xD;
*" I shall look for you at .five," said he, as he&#xD;
started away with the lady, " good bye."&#xD;
" Good bye and than you, sir," replied the&#xD;
girl.                     .     '&#xD;
" Why did you buy so many apples, Rob-&#xD;
ert P" asked the lady.&#xD;
"Well, Mary, you seemed to take such an&#xD;
interest in the girl," he replied, laughing,&#xD;
" that I thought I would set her up in busi-&#xD;
ness."&#xD;
"I suppose they will keep," continned the&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
" The apples !. yes, all we will ever see of&#xD;
them."&#xD;
" What do you mean, Robert I" -&#xD;
" I mean that she will never bring us the&#xD;
aplesC."&#xD;
" Oh ! you wrong the child, Robert."&#xD;
" You will see," he replied, " I do not expect&#xD;
her to bring either the apples or the change."&#xD;
" Thea why did you leave it with her I"&#xD;
" To show you, Mary, how little you can&#xD;
judge of these wild children of New York by&#xD;
appearances. Now here is one, innocent look-&#xD;
ing and--well, beautiful, if you will, and yet&#xD;
I'll guarantee she will' never be seen by us&#xD;
again.n",&#xD;
" Then itkwas wrong in you to tempt her,"&#xD;
replied the lady. '&#xD;
" Perhaps it was," he replied, with more&#xD;
seriousness, " I never looked at it in that&#xD;
Slight.n"&#xD;
"I did not think you :would judge so harsh-&#xD;
ly," said the lady, "and I still think she will&#xD;
do what is right."n.&#xD;
"I hope she will come, Mary,"~ he replied,&#xD;
"for since you mention it, I think it was not&#xD;
right to tempt her to do wrong."&#xD;
&#xD;
ed look, " you see I've been doing a wholesale&#xD;
business."&#xD;
" What's th6 matter, beauty," said the&#xD;
match girl, who now came up.&#xD;
Mary looked surprised at the new-coiner,&#xD;
and after a moment's reflection, asked what&#xD;
she meant.&#xD;
-"Wihat do I mean l" replied the other, "why&#xD;
what are you packing up for I Are you going&#xD;
to leave Broadwayi You'll find your beauty&#xD;
will get more customers here than elsewhere."&#xD;
"You are candid," replied Mary, her face&#xD;
coloring, half in anger, " I am not going to&#xD;
leave Broadway, however, but I have sold these&#xD;
apples, and, therefore, need not stay here, but&#xD;
will get more and come back."&#xD;
" Where's your customerI" asked the other,&#xD;
and then, making a deep reverence to Philip,&#xD;
she asked, "Ilas this young gentleman bought&#xD;
you out ?"&#xD;
" No, I haven't,'" replied Philip, sharply.&#xD;
" The gentleman who bought them, has gone&#xD;
on towards Wall street," replied Mary, "and&#xD;
I am to leave the apples at the Astor House."&#xD;
" Oh ! he hasn't paid you for them," said the&#xD;
match girl."&#xD;
" Yes indeed he has," said Mary, triumphant-&#xD;
ly, " and I have two dollars and a half change&#xD;
to take to him,"&#xD;
" And you're going to do it ?"&#xD;
" Of course I am."&#xD;
" Well, you're a green 'un, I'd like' to catch&#xD;
myself doin' such a thing."&#xD;
" Why, what would you do 7"&#xD;
" Do! I'd clap the money in my pocket, move&#xD;
to another point, sell my apples again, and&#xD;
keep the whole of it."&#xD;
" Oh! you wouldn't be so wicked !".&#xD;
" My eyes! wouldn'tIf Well, you wait till&#xD;
you've seen as much of rough and tumble as I&#xD;
have," replied the match gii'l, with a knowing&#xD;
&#xD;
"They walked on, discussing this and other |&#xD;
subjects, admiring the fine buildings, and&#xD;

"Oh! you've got a mother," replied the&#xD;
other, as she started off; "well, by-by, doughy,&#xD;
i'll see you again.~~&#xD;
"The gentlenman gave me his card," said&#xD;
Mary, showing it to Philip, "and I would not&#xD;
disappoint him for the world."&#xD;
"You are right, Mary," replied Philip, as he&#xD;
took the card. "Robert McDonald, New Or-&#xD;
cans," he exclaimed, "why, I know him, he is&#xD;
such a good man and his wife is a sweet lady."&#xD;
"It must have been his wife that was with&#xD;
him," said Mary, "and, as you say, she is a&#xD;
real angel-looking lady."&#xD;
Philip now thought of the postoffice, and'&#xD;
bidding Mary good-bye, he hastened on. After&#xD;
getting the letters, he caught on behind a&#xD;
Grand street stage, and rode up, arriving at&#xD;
the store just as Mr. Muslin was beginning to&#xD;
get impatient at his long absence. The match&#xD;
girl continued on her way, offering her wares&#xD;
to those she met, with a careless indifference&#xD;
that showed long usage to the roughness of the&#xD;
world. Turning into Dey street, without&#xD;
noticing where she was going, she ran against&#xD;
a gentleman coming to Broadway, and, without&#xD;
apology or being in the least dise&amp;amp;ncerted,&#xD;
said, "Buy some matches~ sir!"&#xD;
"No," was the sharp re~~ly.&#xD;
"Well, you needn't st4ke fire," said she,&#xD;
with a sneer, "nobody's 4oing to cry if you&#xD;
don't."&#xD;
"You are an impudent g ri," said he.&#xD;
"You're no gentleman ,"~he replied, with a&#xD;
toss of her head, "or you couldn'tt speak to a&#xD;
lady that way.''&#xD;
" This is the first ~ said he, smiling,&#xD;
"that I ever knew a lady tp be a match girl."&#xD;
"I'm a match for you, ar~y how."&#xD;
"Ceme now," said he; "don't you think it is&#xD;
wrong to act so bold and unwomanly."&#xD;
"Don't give me none of your lectures," said&#xD;
she, drawing near to him, "I had enough of&#xD;
that thing when they called the mission last&#xD;
"But don't you think," said he, looking at her&#xD;
quite earnestly, "that if you were quiet and&#xD;
genteel you would sell more of your goods I"&#xD;
"Lord bless you, no P' said she, with a&#xD;
knowing nod, "you men loves t~ be run&#xD;
against, fooled with and talked to, and I tell&#xD;
you I don't carry my tongue in my pocket.~~&#xD;
"How old are you I"&#xD;
"Don't know," she replied carelessly, "some&#xD;
says I'm nine and some seven, so I splits the&#xD;
difference and calls myself eight."&#xD;

placed in his coat pocket, never doubting that&#xD;
they were the same that the ~i1d had on&#xD;
when carried away. There was no clue to the&#xD;
matter there, and after spending several&#xD;
months in the neighborhood, he went to New&#xD;
York. An advertisement for a thorough and&#xD;
oompetant detective, which he inserted in one&#xD;
of the daily papers, brought about an inter-&#xD;
view with Mr. Henry Williams. Williams was&#xD;
a native of the city, a man of excellent char-&#xD;
acter, but one who in his early days, had.&#xD;
been "through the ~ and knew every&#xD;
crook and turn in it. He had served as a spe-&#xD;
cial officer in the service of several banks and&#xD;
railroad companies, and had made the "secret&#xD;
service" his especial study, and in working up'&#xD;
some famous cases had gained a wide reputa-&#xD;
tion. MacVain wanted now his whole time,&#xD;
and when he stated the compensation he&#xD;
would require, closed with him at once and&#xD;
detailed to him a history of the case, suppress-&#xD;
ing only the real name of the child* sad his&#xD;
own agency in her los~. Since that time Wil-&#xD;
liams had spent his time in working up the&#xD;
history of every wan~eriug girl that by any&#xD;
reasoning he could think was the right one.&#xD;
Besides his regular salary, a large reward was&#xD;
to be paid him on the successful termination&#xD;
of his service, and he had become, from long&#xD;
study, deeply interested in ~he case. Seve~l&#xD;
tunes he had thought he 'vas on the road&#xD;
to success, but after spending weeks, sou~times&#xD;
months in hunting up the history of the girl&#xD;
he had picked out as tl~ lost child, he would&#xD;
discover her parentage or place of birth,&#xD;
friends and relations, and would have to com-&#xD;
mence on another track. He was, therefore&#xD;
much pleased to find there was at last a good&#xD;
prospect t~or success. He as well as MacVain,&#xD;
rested easier that night, with the hope of an&#xD;
early ter~nination to their long and tedious&#xD;
hunt.&#xD;
CILAPrER V.&#xD;
When Mr. McDonald returned to his rooms at&#xD;
the Astor, he was well tired out with his long&#xD;
walk, andlaying down ona sofa, he advised his&#xD;
wife to take a good rest before preparing for&#xD;
ihni~er. She sat down in a large arm chair and&#xD;
declared herself completely tired out. While&#xD;
he untied her bonnet and loosened her shawl,&#xD;
he told Robert that she wished he had brought&#xD;
vith him some of the nice apples they had&#xD;

ing with a smile, that the apples would not&#xD;

no reply, but taking her bonnet and shawl&#xD;
went to the center table to lay them oat of her&#xD;
hands.&#xD;
"Look, Robert !" she exclaimed, pointing to a&#xD;
large pile of apples heaped upon the table;&#xD;
"will you have one 7" she asked triumphantly&#xD;
holding up a splendid specimen.&#xD;
"I am right well pleased," he replied, "that&#xD;
you are right and I will eat one with a good&#xD;
relish."&#xD;
"You see, Robert, the girl is honest."&#xD;
"Is the change there, too 7" he asked.&#xD;
"No, but I will guarantee that it will come."&#xD;
"I have no doubt of it. At live o'clock the&#xD;
girl will bring it, I expect, so as to be sure that&#xD;
I get it.&#xD;
And so they rested themselves, took their&#xD;
dinner and returned to their parlor to read the&#xD;
magazines with which they were provided. At&#xD;
five o'clock a servant knocked atthe door and&#xD;
being told to come in, said a girl was waiting&#xD;
to see Mr. McDonald-and obeying that gen-&#xD;
tleman's wishes, he admitted her. She came&#xD;
forward modestly and saluted the lady and&#xD;
gentleman with an easy grace, 1and resuming&#xD;
her erect position with an air of~imple dignity,&#xD;
said that she had delivered the ~pples early, so&#xD;
that she might buy more and resume her place&#xD;
on the street, and she had now called with&#xD;
the change, which, as she euciduded her cx-&#xD;
planatioi~, she placed in Mr. McDonald's band'&#xD;
"You are a good girl," said Mr. McDonald&#xD;
kindly, "and deserve to be encouraged; take&#xD;
this change and keep it, it will help to in-&#xD;
crease your stock, or get some article you&#xD;
need."&#xD;
"I thank you, sir," she replied, "but I would&#xD;
rather not."&#xD;
"Not take it 1" exclaimed the astonished&#xD;
gentleman.&#xD;
"No, sir, if you please," and then she added&#xD;
with a dignity far beyond her years, "I. have&#xD;
only performed my duty, and therefore ails en-&#xD;
titled tono reward."&#xD;
"You have acted honestly, my child," said&#xD;
Mrs. McDonald, her face glowing with pleas-&#xD;
ure, "and in a world of temptation, such ac-&#xD;
tions deserve both commendation and reward."&#xD;
"My wife is right," the gentleman said,&#xD;
"take the change."&#xD;
&#xD;
"I cannot, sir, but I thank you all the same."&#xD;
"Why can not you take it, you are welcome&#xD;
to it 7"&#xD;
"My mother, sir, always tells me to accept&#xD;
of no money, that I have not honestly earned."&#xD;
"What is your name?" asked Mrs. McDonald.&#xD;
"Mary Collins, ma'am."&#xD;
"Hdw old are you, Mary 7"&#xD;
"I was eight years old last Shrove Tuesday,"&#xD;
said M4ry.&#xD;
"Indeed! you are a Catholic, I suppose.~~&#xD;
"Yes, ma'm," the girl modestly replied.&#xD;
'~That's a good girl," replied Mrs. McDonald.&#xD;
~'I am sure you are a great assistance and con-&#xD;
solation to your mother."&#xD;
Mary then bade them good-bye and started&#xD;
for home. Going down Eulton street, she was&#xD;
soon in the crowd of 'people who were all hur-&#xD;
rying towards the ferry-house. There were&#xD;
females of all ages, from girls like herself to&#xD;
lecrepid old women, from the hat factories,&#xD;
book-binderies, cloak makers, tailor shops and&#xD;
stores of different trades where they were em-&#xD;
ployed to sew, fold, cut out or do other work.&#xD;
There were crowds of men and boys, of all&#xD;
ages and belonging to every class and trade,&#xD;
the shop boy with his basket or can, in which&#xD;
the lunch that made his noon day meal was&#xD;
carried, the porter, carpenter, and black-smith&#xD;
covered with the dust and smoke of a hard day~s&#xD;
toil, the clerk, ,ner'Shant, broker and profes-&#xD;
sional man, in all the styles of dress known to&#xD;
a city, from the plain Quaker, with his broad&#xD;
b imined hat, to the cnnse~ientiid clerk in the&#xD;
la est style of garments and shining beaver&#xD;
hn~t. All were hurrying, like the waters in a&#xD;
sw~lien river, towards the one point of exit&#xD;
fro~u the great city, seemingly unconscious of&#xD;
th~existenc~ of those around. Near the mar-*&#xD;
ke~ a man was standing, apparently waiting&#xD;
for the arrival or passage of some one. lie&#xD;
was tall and commanding in appearance and&#xD;
dressed with scroupulous neatness, rich in ma-&#xD;
ter~al, without auy of the show or flash of a&#xD;
fo~ or man of the town. Was he studying&#xD;
the phases of human nature in the passing&#xD;
crowd? In this rushing, bustling throng there&#xD;
were hearts as lonely and isolated, as if they&#xD;
were lost in the forest of the west. The man&#xD;
of wealth and ease passed along, and at his&#xD;
side were those oppressed with care, want and&#xD;
misery. The young girl, tender in years, whose&#xD;
face, pale and thin, yet clouded with a look of&#xD;
boldness and wordly knowledge, gave evidence&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
years had been stout and robust, but age, ex-&#xD;
posure and sickness had left, as it were, only&#xD;
the skeleton of her former self. Her face was&#xD;
mild, and bore a pleasant look, though now&#xD;
pale and care-worn. Her hair was thin and sil-&#xD;
vered over with long years of care, and many&#xD;
disappointments in life. Her dress, well worn,&#xD;
had been brushed, mended and turned, and her&#xD;
whole appearance was that of a person who&#xD;
had seen good times, and even yet struggled&#xD;
bard to keep up a respectable appearance,.&#xD;
Stooping over, Mary kissed her and tenderly&#xD;
inquired how she felt.        e      ,&#xD;
"I feel better, my child," she replied, taking&#xD;
off her glasses and wiping them in a mechani-.&#xD;
cal way as she spoke, "as the summer comes&#xD;
on I gather strength, and hope for even better&#xD;
yet."&#xD;
"I am glad to hear you say so, mother," the&#xD;
child replied, "I am sure when your health is&#xD;
good we will get along finely."&#xD;
"Yes, dear, but I can hardly expect ever to&#xD;
be strong again.n"&#xD;
"Do not say so, dear mother," the child re--&#xD;
plied earnestly, "what would I do without&#xD;
youi Think of all that and cheer up.n"&#xD;
"I do; think of it often," said her mother,&#xD;
"and in truth it is the only reason why I would&#xD;
wish to live.n"&#xD;
"See, I brought you some nice jelly," replied&#xD;
Mary, "and a mutton chop for your breakfast,&#xD;
I am sure you will relish them."&#xD;
"You are always thoughtful, Mary, dear."&#xD;
Mary then busied herself in preparing their&#xD;
little supper, of which she ate with the hearty&#xD;
relish of youth, and the neat arrangements,&#xD;
with the excellent manner in which the food&#xD;
wais prepared, made even her invalid mother&#xD;
enjoy the meal. After the dishes were washed&#xD;
and put away, she took a book and read for a&#xD;
short time, after which they said their evening&#xD;
devotions together and then retired to rest.&#xD;
CHAPTER VL.&#xD;
-As the twilight shadows gathered over the&#xD;
city, work-shops, stores, manufactories and&#xD;
offices poured forth their operatives, workmen&#xD;
-and managers, each one seeking the direction of&#xD;
that oasis in the desert of life, called home,&#xD;
where for a, few short hours of night their&#xD;
bodies should find rest and their 'minds be re-.&#xD;

looking at the new corner, "if you want a&#xD;
seat, Sally, take a box, for that's my chair."&#xD;
"I guess I pay as much as any of you in this&#xD;
room," replied the large girl, "and I've as&#xD;
good a right in here."&#xD;
" Oh! you're always around when there's&#xD;
anything good to be had for nothing," said&#xD;
Cecelia, "get up out of that chair, you&#xD;
sponge'"&#xD;
" Say that again, and I'll--"&#xD;
" You'll what I" said Cecelia, angrily,&#xD;
" What'll you do? Turn the North River in on&#xD;
us i"&#xD;
&#xD;
by the thoughts of the uncertain morrow. In&#xD;
the throng that moved up town, Cecelia Ben-&#xD;
son, the match girl, pushed her yray along, el-&#xD;
bowing this one and jostling another of the&#xD;
crowd with a careless indifference to their feel-&#xD;
ings or opinions. She passed out of one street&#xD;
into another, until, turning into one of the&#xD;
short streets that cross Centre, she entered one&#xD;
of a row of high brick buildings, around the&#xD;
door and alley way of which a crowd of rag-&#xD;
ged children, and older boys and girls were&#xD;
gathered, talking, laughing and disputing&#xD;
with each other. As Cecehia ,came forward&#xD;
they stopped their play and conversation,&#xD;
some as if in fear and others in admiration of&#xD;
tlhe new corner. One, a boy of about fourteen&#xD;
years of age, with a coat, the tail of which&#xD;
was very long, and the arms very short and of-&#xD;
ten patched, addressed her.&#xD;
"I say, Ceal, how much did you make to-&#xD;
day7" .&#xD;
-"None you're business, Jake," was the short&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"You need'nt bite about it," said Jake-.&#xD;
"Well, you need'nt poke your nose in other&#xD;
people's affairs," replied the girl. She entered&#xD;
the house, followed by the boy and one of the&#xD;
larger girls. Passing through the long, dark&#xD;
hail, in which the nd and dirt of passing&#xD;
feet for months had accumulated, she went up&#xD;
the winding back stairs, rickety and worn,'&#xD;
while here and there great pieces of tlze plas-&#xD;
tering had fallen out. All the way up, the&#xD;
walls were so blackened with the smoke .and&#xD;
dirt of years, that it would have been hard&#xD;
to even suppose they were ever white. Still&#xD;
ascending until she reached the fifth and last&#xD;
story, Cecelia went along a dark entry, at the&#xD;
end of which, through an open door, she en-&#xD;
tered the small room that constituted the&#xD;
home of herself and three of the other young&#xD;
girls of the place. In one corner of the room&#xD;
a large sized mattress was rolled up, and the&#xD;
clothes belonging to it werepiled over it with-&#xD;
out care or order. Two single mattresses were&#xD;
placed side by side in another part of the&#xD;
room, and the coverings of these were arranged&#xD;
ready for their occupants. A medium sized&#xD;
pine table sat before the small fireplace, and&#xD;
served both as a dining and centre table.&#xD;
The room contained two chairs, and some&#xD;
small boxes that answered the double purpose&#xD;
of holding the wardrobes and other possessions&#xD;
of the occupants, and when necessity required,&#xD;
&#xD;
MARDI GRAS ;&#xD;
&#xD;
A-TALE Oh' ANTE BELL UA TIMES. 1&#xD;
&#xD;
"If I ain't, I've got the money to buy it&#xD;
with." As she spoke she took a small pitcher&#xD;
off the table, and, turning it over, gave it&#xD;
a good shake in lien of washing it; "here,&#xD;
Jake, go down to the Corner and get some&#xD;
beer, a loaf of bread, and let them put a rare&#xD;
done dime steak in the loaf."&#xD;
"Let him get some cheese, Ceely."&#xD;
"Well ,ge t some, Jake," she replied, " and&#xD;
don't be gone all night-and, look here, Jake,"&#xD;
she said, calling him back,- " don't drink none&#xD;
of th9 beer till you get back."&#xD;
While he was gone the girls cleared the&#xD;
table and placed the chairs for themselves and&#xD;
a box for their messenger. He was back Very&#xD;
soon, and with him came a girl fifteen or six-&#xD;
teen years of age, who very coolly seated herself I&#xD;
in one of the chairs, and ordered the boy to&#xD;
spread out his purchases'.&#xD;
"Well, I like that considerable," said 1411y, ,&#xD;
&#xD;
were used as seats. .Around the wall we&#xD;
hung or pasted up, numerous pictures ci&#xD;
from the illustrated papers of the day, to&#xD;
from books, or picked out of the dirt boxes&#xD;
front of dry goods and variety dealers' store&#xD;
A candle, half consumed, was burning on th&#xD;
table, seeing which the girl said,.&#xD;
"Somebody's precious wasteful, to light&#xD;
candle and go off and leave it a burning. Hop&#xD;
it's. one they paid for themselves.'' A heav&#xD;
breathing attracted her attention, and turnin&#xD;
around she saw one of her companions layin&#xD;
on one of the small mattresses. "Betsy, Bel&#xD;
sy," she said, shaking the sleeping girl ; "Bel&#xD;
sy, you're on myi bed andl you ain't undresse&#xD;
neither. Say, look at you, with your dirt&#xD;
feet on my new quilt."&#xD;
"Go away, and leave me alone," said the oth&#xD;
er, half aroused from her shumber.&#xD;
"You're drunk, Betsy," said Cecelia, "an(&#xD;
you're in my lied."&#xD;
"Don't care," drawled out the other.&#xD;
"Oh! you don't! Well, I'll see,"; replied Ce&#xD;
celia, now thoroughly angry. As she turne&#xD;
to search for something'in the shape of a whii&#xD;
or stick to wake up Betsy, she was interrupted&#xD;
by the entrance of Jake and the girl with him,&#xD;
This girl was one of those who occupied the&#xD;
large bed, and was a favorite, with Cecelia.&#xD;
" Look, Nelly," said Cecelia, " there's Betsy&#xD;
in my bed, as drunk as she can be."&#xD;
" Oh ! never mind her," relied th   il&#xD;
"hv  yuaythig good to eat, Ceely I"&#xD;
&#xD;
t- "Take your old chair 1" said the other, start-&#xD;
d ing for the door.&#xD;
y "Come back here, Sally," said Cecelia,&#xD;
wiping out a tumbler with the skirt of her&#xD;
- dress, " come, have a glass of beer andi some-&#xD;
thing to eat."&#xD;
dThe girl came back iind seated herself at the&#xD;
table on an empty candle box. The conversa-&#xD;
tion almost ceased during the time they were&#xD;
. eating, each one helped themselves and the&#xD;
beer was circulated until finished. The boy&#xD;
was the first to finish his meal. Getting up&#xD;
from the table, he went to the mantel-piece&#xD;
.and took up a pack of well worn cards, the&#xD;
dirty backs and frayed edges of which spoke&#xD;
of their long service. Again seating himself&#xD;
at the table, he began to shuffle and deal the&#xD;
hands for an imaginary game.&#xD;
" Let's play a game of seven-up," said the&#xD;
oldest girl.&#xD;
"Oh, no, Sally, let's play euchre," said&#xD;
Nelly.&#xD;
" Poker is the most amusenest game," said&#xD;
Jake.&#xD;
"Well, now, I tell you what it is," said&#xD;
Cecelia, "nobody plays that can't show their&#xD;
money before they commence."&#xD;
" You're terrible pertickler," replied Sally.&#xD;
" I don't care," said Cecelia, as she cleared&#xD;
the table, " I ain't going to play for nothing."&#xD;
'd I'm willing to that," said Sally.&#xD;
"Yes, but let's see the documents," the&#xD;
other replied, " them as looses never pays un-&#xD;
less the money's up."&#xD;
As she was determined on this point, each&#xD;
one produced the money they /had, Nelly and&#xD;
Sally about a dollar and a half each and Jake&#xD;
a dollar, at which Cecelia triumphantly count-&#xD;
ed up her capital of nearly four dollars, re-&#xD;
marking that she knew all along that none of&#xD;
them could match her.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8171-00000011"/>&#xD;
20&#xD;
&#xD;
"Take the pitcher, Jake," said Nelly,&#xD;
throwing out a five cent piece, "and get some&#xD;
more beer before we commence."&#xD;
"I am tired of beer," Sally exclaimed, laying&#xD;
out a dime, "put in all round and let him get&#xD;
some whiskeyy."&#xD;
"Whiskey's too common," said Ceceliri,&#xD;
making her addition to the refreshment&#xD;
money, "let's have a bottle of claret."&#xD;
Claret was decided upon, and Jake soon re-&#xD;
turned with a bottle of that article.&#xD;
The game was commenced at once, and each&#xD;
one entered into it with a coolness and calcu-&#xD;
lation that showed they were no new hands at&#xD;
it. The, bets were made freely, and, for the&#xD;
parties eng~iged, heavily; thQ fortunes of&#xD;
chance, whether for or against, were taken&#xD;
with apparent indifference, while the wine was&#xD;
passed around often. After they bad been&#xD;
playing an hour or more, Cecelia and Sally&#xD;
only were in oh the hafrd, the former quietly&#xD;
covered the money with her hand and, said,&#xD;
"You forfeit this money; you are cheating,&#xD;
as~ d I claim the pool."&#xD;
1" What do you mean by that I" indignantly&#xD;
replied the other, reaching out for the money.&#xD;
"No, you don't," said Cecelia, "just take&#xD;
them two cards out of yont sleeve, you can't&#xD;
come that on me."&#xD;
Finding herself caught, the other girl&#xD;
dropped the cards on the floor, and tried~ to ex-&#xD;
plain that she had lost them while dealing the&#xD;
last hand. Cecelia kept the money, some&#xD;
liquor was sent. for, and the game continued.&#xD;
It was after midnight when they stopped play-&#xD;
ing and retired to sleep, fortune having favored&#xD;
Cecelia, who had won nearly all their money&#xD;
from the others. Aftershehad gone to bed, sleep&#xD;
refused to come to her relief; the liquor which&#xD;
had stupilied her companions seemed to have&#xD;
excited her nerves and driven away the possi-&#xD;
bility of sleep. She thought' of the events of&#xD;
the day, laughed heartily as the idea of some&#xD;
of the scenes passed through her mind, and&#xD;
wondered what MacVain wanted with her the&#xD;
next day. Then the idea of a pleasure trip oc-&#xD;
curred to her, and she resolved to go down to&#xD;
the fishing banks on the following~ day. She&#xD;
remembered a boy she used to know who sold&#xD;
papers on a railroad train, and she thought&#xD;
that it must be a pleasant life to travel about&#xD;
from city to city, with so many changes of&#xD;
scene and hurried along by the bustle and ac-&#xD;
tivity of the traveling crowds. Being of a&#xD;
&#xD;
restless, changing natnr~, these thoughts, us&#xD;
they dwelt in her mind, made such an impres-&#xD;
sion on her, that she determined to leave the&#xD;
place at once, and seek new adventures amidst&#xD;
new scenes. Why should she remain there?&#xD;
Without mother or further to control ~r guide&#xD;
her young mind, no relative to whom she could&#xD;
gb in joy or grief, not even a friend for whom&#xD;
she felt more than the friendship of the pass-&#xD;
ing hour, she began to think her present life&#xD;
irksome, and longed for the coming day, that&#xD;
she might put her new i~esolve into actions.&#xD;
She slept but little; nuder the excitement of&#xD;
the dreams that haunted her mind, she could&#xD;
take but fitful naps, from which she ev~r and&#xD;
anon would start up, and look out anxiously&#xD;
for the first sign of the coming day. When at&#xD;
last It broke forth in all the gorgeous loveli-&#xD;
ness of a June morning, she hurried down&#xD;
stairs to the back room, which was occupied&#xD;
by a junk dealer, who was also lessee of the&#xD;
entire house, renting the rooms to the differ-&#xD;
ent occupants, by the day, week or month,&#xD;
taking care in every instance to get paid in&#xD;
advance. No extra lodgers were allowed in&#xD;
the house; visitors, even, though they shared&#xD;
the bed occupied by their friend, were obliged&#xD;
to pay for their nights' lodging,' or it was&#xD;
charged to the person who invited them. This&#xD;
rule was rigidly enforced, as Mr. Sanderbund&#xD;
said, to "keep up der dignity mit der house."&#xD;
When Cecelia entered she found him, by the&#xD;
dim light of a lamp, examining the purchases&#xD;
made by his wife, during his absence on the&#xD;
previous day.&#xD;
"hhumph! vet you want I" he asked.&#xD;
"I'm going to leave," was the curt reply&#xD;
"Vy ~ Dat ish a nice room."&#xD;
"I didn't say it wasn't."&#xD;
"Vell, it is so cheap as wet they ask enny&#xD;
vere else," said he.&#xD;
"I don't care anything about that," Cecelia&#xD;
replied.&#xD;
"Vet is der matter?" he asked, for she al.&#xD;
wayS earned a fair amount of money, was good&#xD;

"That's all true, I suppose," she replied,&#xD;

"Yes," she replied,'With mock dignity, "I'w&#xD;

"Yes, but rriy bill is paid for the full month,"&#xD;
she said.&#xD;
"Veil, if you likes, you stays der full n~onth&#xD;
I no turn you out."&#xD;
"That's as much as to say if I go before my&#xD;
month is out, you will refund nothing I" she&#xD;
said, inquiringly.&#xD;
"No, I can not pays you pack," he said,&#xD;
hastily, "dat vas against der rhul6s."&#xD;
"Just so," she replied, "but we will not&#xD;
quarrel about that. I have got some things&#xD;
up stairs I want to sell you. I suppose you&#xD;
will buy them I"&#xD;
"Ya-as. I pays down and I pays you so&#xD;
much as nopody else wduld do."&#xD;
With this they proceeded up stairs to the&#xD;
little room, where Sanderbund purchased the&#xD;
few bed-clothes and other articles that-Cecelia&#xD;
could not take with her. She was too much&#xD;
engrossed with the idea of leaving the city to&#xD;
stau~l witll him about the prices, so that he got&#xD;
the articles at his own terms, congratulating&#xD;
himself that, if he lost a good tenant, he would&#xD;
make something on the bargain that closed&#xD;
their acquaintance. Rolling her scanty ward-&#xD;
robe up in a small bundle, Cecelia left the&#xD;
house before the other occupants of thc room,&#xD;
stupified with their frolic of the night before,&#xD;
were aroused from their slumbers, and thus,&#xD;
alone, all her possessions in the little package,&#xD;
the child started out for a new battle with the&#xD;
world. No feeling of loneliness oppressed her&#xD;
heart, for she had always been accustomed to&#xD;
take cure of herself, ahd follow the dictates of&#xD;
her own will. She felt a. relief at the idea of&#xD;
entering upon new scenes, and, having resolved&#xD;
to try Boston, she tripped gayly along to-&#xD;
wards the N~ haven depot.&#xD;
I~IacVain was at the appointed place long&#xD;
before the promised time, and wated patiently&#xD;
hour after hour for the little match ~irl. He&#xD;
could not account for her not comm ~, never&#xD;
dreaming that she was far on her road to an-&#xD;
other city.&#xD;
Mr. Edward Crape was the junior partner of&#xD;
the house of Barege, Muslin &amp;amp; Co. lie was a&#xD;
slender mar', of three or four and twenty,&#xD;
dressed in the latest style and the best ma-&#xD;
terial. lie had a very light mustache, the&#xD;
only show for a beard that had yet blessed his&#xD;
hopes, and repaid his assiduous attention to&#xD;
that part of the "make up" of a man. This&#xD;
&#xD;
hair was always parted in the centre, a fact&#xD;
which did not detract from the disagi-ecable&#xD;
appearance of a low forehead, and a sbort~&#xD;
well turned-up nose. About dry goods he&#xD;
knew very little and cared less.; he was a&#xD;
nephew of Mr. hlarege, a fact that accon uted&#xD;
for his interest in the house, where he had&#xD;
been for many years. lie went from one de-&#xD;
partment to another, introducing customers to&#xD;
the salesmen, and making suggestions to them&#xD;
about the arrangement of their stocks, hints&#xD;
that were generally thrown away, as the men&#xD;
knew more about* the business than he did.&#xD;
lie was not shop walker, but acted as an as-&#xD;
sistant to that important individual. His es-&#xD;
pecial delight was to order and direct the boys&#xD;
of the establishment, who, while they despised&#xD;
him, dared not disregard his orders. To show&#xD;
his authority and domineer over those around&#xD;
him, was consistent with his small nature, and&#xD;
these youngerr employees were the only ones&#xD;
who would listen to him without rebelling.&#xD;
"Mr. Droll, you had better display a coin men&#xD;
poipt this dusty weather," he said one day,&#xD;
"the fine ones will get damaged easily."&#xD;
"Certainly, sir, that is only reasonable,"&#xD;
said Peter, adding, in an under tone, "Wonder&#xD;
if the fool thinks he can learn me any thino"'&#xD;
They had been busy, and Mr. Droll had not&#xD;
had an idle moment since the morning. He&#xD;
was a great favorite with the ladies, especially&#xD;
such of them as liked to dilly-daily over their&#xD;
purchases, admire this, and compare with that,&#xD;
talk about the fashions and discuss that ever&#xD;
ready subject-the weather.&#xD;
"It is a very pretty lace," said Mrs. Gabble,&#xD;
an occasional customer of the store, who was~&#xD;
" well to do in the world" and delighted in&#xD;
shopping.&#xD;
"Elegant, Mrs. Gabble, real article, very&#xD;
fresh and new," replied Peter, while, in an&#xD;
under tone, he added, "been in the house&#xD;
seven years, and I'd like to get rid of it-if it&#xD;
would only hold together until she sewed it&#xD;
on, that's all I'd care ~&#xD;
"Which do you think would be most suit~&#xD;
able, Mr. Droll I" inquired the lady, hol~iug&#xD;
up two pieces of the lace.&#xD;
"That in your right hand," he said, with a&#xD;
smile and a deciding nod of his head, con tinn-&#xD;
ing, soto voce, "how should I know, she&#xD;
didn't tell me what she was going to do with&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"I believe I'll not mind it to-day," said Mrs.&#xD;

Gab'Ae, "I want it to match, and I haven't&#xD;
got a sample with me."&#xD;
"Very well, Madam, any t~me, we always&#xD;
have a good assortment," replied Peter, in his&#xD;
most bland and gentlemanly manner, saying&#xD;
to himself "I thought SO! She don't want to&#xD;
buy lace, more'n a calf wants buttermilk."&#xD;
"Oh! Mr. Droll, I almost forgot to ask if&#xD;
you had bobbinet for shawls I" and Mrs. Gab-&#xD;
ble took her seat again.&#xD;
"Yes, mn'am, we have,, they just come from&#xD;
the custom-house yesterday."&#xD;
"Let me see them, Mr. Droll, if you please."&#xD;
"With pleasure, Mrs. Gabble, and I'm sure&#xD;
you haven't seen such goods before this sea-&#xD;
son," and Peter turned to select the box, say-&#xD;
ing privately, "Eb, gad, what a bore, I pity&#xD;
poor Gabble."&#xD;
"Oh, is'nt that flue, such an elegant texture,&#xD;
just like a cloud," said the lady, admiring&#xD;
first one piece and then another, "what is the&#xD;
price of this?"&#xD;
"That is worth four dollars," replied Peter.&#xD;
The piece was marked to sell for three." She&#xD;
won't buy it, and, if she does, she'll jew me&#xD;
down."&#xD;
After looking at the entire contents of the&#xD;
box, and admiring them all, Mrs. Gabble re-&#xD;
turned to the first piece she had looked at.&#xD;
"Is four dollars the best you can do for&#xD;
this?" she asked.&#xD;
"I declare, I believe she does want to buy,"&#xD;
said Peter to himself and then continued,&#xD;
aloud, "Well-let me see-to an old customer&#xD;
like you-under the circumstances-well, i'll&#xD;
let you have it for three."&#xD;
"Three dollars I" she said, with hesitation.&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am, and it is very cheap," then he&#xD;
continued, in an undertone, "now, haggle&#xD;
away, you contemptible old crone."&#xD;
"Well, I'll see-I'll be over again first of the&#xD;
week," she said, rising to go, "and I think I&#xD;
will take it then."&#xD;
"If you want it," Peter replied, determined&#xD;
to make a sale if he could, "I wil 1 give it to&#xD;
you to-day for-two dollars and a half."&#xD;
"Not to-day, thank you, Mr. Droll, it is very&#xD;
fine, and reasonable, too, but I'll wait till next&#xD;
week," and Mrs. Gabble graciously took her&#xD;
departure.&#xD;
"Good day, Mrs. Gabble," said Mr. Droll;&#xD;
"such an infernal set of shoppers I never did&#xD;
see; talk, twaddle, talk, jewjew, jew, may the&#xD;
deil fly awa wi 'em."&#xD;
&#xD;
Three or four customers followed Mrs. Gab-&#xD;
ble, were waited on by Peter, whpse equanimity&#xD;
was by this time restored. lie was a kind-&#xD;
hearted man, firm in his friendships, with&#xD;
many peculiar ways and odd sayings. A long&#xD;
experience in the business had given him a&#xD;
tact of understanding his customers, almost at&#xD;
first sight, and with those who came to buy he&#xD;
was quick, fair and just, and with "profession-&#xD;
al shoppers" he could get along better and&#xD;
make more sales than any other man in the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
Mr. Crape brought forward a lady aria&#xD;
introduced her to Mr. Samuel Seliwell as a&#xD;
particularfriend of his~ who wished to get a&#xD;
lace point, and requested that gentleman to&#xD;
"put them down low."&#xD;
"A lace point," said Sam, taking down a&#xD;
box, and drawing one out with a flourish, "is&#xD;
the easiest thing in the world to sell, because&#xD;
the quality tells at once, and they sell them-&#xD;
selves-at least ours do. These we imported&#xD;
direct, paid for them on the other side before&#xD;
t iey left the door of the mauufa~ctory, and&#xD;
we, therefore, got them cheap. That's the way&#xD;
we do business. We say to the manufacturer,&#xD;
"We want these goods and here's the money."&#xD;
That always brings them at the lowest pos-si-&#xD;
ble price. 'PiUs point is worth-well, it is&#xD;
worth five hundred dollars-ab, well, madam,&#xD;
but look at the lace, see the work, just ex-&#xD;
amine the pattern. That point was made ex-&#xD;
pressly for Queen Victoria, but when it was&#xD;
finished, for certain reasons, she thought it did&#xD;
not suit, and our buyer, happening idong,&#xD;
picked it up at three hundred dollarss, for&#xD;
which price we now offer it."&#xD;
The point was really a handsome article,&#xD;
and wi~s marked to sell for one hundred and&#xD;
twent~-flve dollars, but Sam talked away&#xD;
about its beauties, its foreign history, and their&#xD;
good fortune in securing so rare an article,&#xD;
with an air of sincerity that would have un-&#xD;
pressed almost any lady with the idea that she&#xD;
was fortunate in being allowed to see it.&#xD;
"It is vcr~ handsome," replied Mrs. Miller,&#xD;
looking at the article with admiration, not un-&#xD;
mingled with awe, "but I do not want so ex-&#xD;
pensive an article."&#xD;
"Here, madam," said Sam, exhibiting an-&#xD;
other, "is a real pusher lace, very fine, from&#xD;
one of the most celebrated makers of France-&#xD;
a rare pattern, the first of the kind ever in-&#xD;
troduced into this country."&#xD;
&#xD;
"What is the price sir 7" inquired Mrs. Mil-&#xD;
icr, looking an if she was almost afraid to ask&#xD;
the question.&#xD;
"One hundred dollars, madam, and certainly&#xD;
the cheapest article in New York at tha~ price.&#xD;
We had eight hundred of them, all different&#xD;
patterns, but of the same quality, and this is&#xD;
the only one we have left."&#xD;
"It is more than I cr.re about giving,~~ was&#xD;
the reply.&#xD;
"Ali) now we come to itV and Sam drew&#xD;
another out of the box with a triumphant&#xD;
flourish, "this is the Lama, very stylish, we&#xD;
have been selling them at sixty-five dollars,&#xD;
but this one I will put to you at fifty.5&#xD;
Mrs. Miller examined the article closely, de-&#xD;
clared it very handsome, but hesitated to say&#xD;
more.&#xD;
After this Mr. Seliwell ~hibited four or fi~&#xD;
others, displaying them in the besV light, and&#xD;
enpatiating on the beauty and elegance of each&#xD;
one.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Now here is one," said Sam, in a confiden-&#xD;
tial manner, "that Mr. Muslin put aside f.r a&#xD;
friend of his-it is a vcry neat pattern, line&#xD;
quality., and will wemir a life-time. You see,&#xD;
this woyk is very light and airy, that vine is&#xD;
beautiful, the col~ is elegant and will never&#xD;
turn-we've sold over chr3e hundred of them&#xD;
this week."&#xD;
"how much could you let me have it for 7'&#xD;
"Well, now-let me see-it is marked-Mr.&#xD;
Droll, what do we sell ehcse ME points at 7"&#xD;
The private mark of the house was Cum-&#xD;
Lerlar~f1, so Peter promptly answered, "Thirty-&#xD;
fre dollars."&#xD;
-' Yes, madam, thirty-five dollars," said Sam,&#xD;
' but, as it is you, I'll call it thirty, and run&#xD;
the risk of a scolding."&#xD;
Mrs. Miller took the point at that price, paid&#xD;
the money, and was politely bowed out by Mr.&#xD;
Sellwell. In wrapping u~p, the mark had been&#xD;
shown to Mr. Crape by the foreman of the&#xD;
packing room, and Mr. Crape, as usual, was&#xD;
led by curiosity to the cashier's desk, where he&#xD;
learned the price that Mrs. Miller had paid for&#xD;
the article.&#xD;
"Mr. SeIlwell. didn't I tell you Mrs. Miller&#xD;
was a friend of mine," said he, approaching&#xD;
that genthiman in a great passion.&#xD;
"Yes, I believe you did," carelessly replied&#xD;
Sam, as he folded the points and put them&#xD;
away.&#xD;
"The point you sold her was marked twenty-&#xD;
&#xD;
two dollars, and you charged her thirty, si;!~&#xD;
said Mr. Crape, his rage increasing.&#xD;
"Well, if you wanted a point given away,&#xD;
you should have waited on her yourself," re-&#xD;
plied Sam, returning a box to its place on the&#xD;
shelves.&#xD;
"I'll have you know, sir, that I won't have&#xD;
such things in this house."&#xD;
"Oh, come now, don't kick up such a riffle&#xD;
about nothing," said Sam, stopping in his work&#xD;
to address Mr. Crape.&#xD;
"If you speak to me in that way," was the.&#xD;
rep!y, "I'll discharge you."&#xD;
"When 7" coolly asked Sam.&#xD;
"Now, right away, sir," said Mr. Crape.&#xD;
"Well, thia ain't the only dry goods store in&#xD;
New York," said Sam, taking down his hat,&#xD;
"and this will suit me as well as any day."&#xD;
"Go to the office, sir, and have your account&#xD;
settled," said Mr. Crape indignantly.&#xD;
"Well, you come along," said Sam, and the&#xD;
two walked into the office, whore Sam, request-&#xD;
ed to have his account made up. Mr. Barege,&#xD;
was in his great easy office chair, and looked&#xD;
up with surprise, when he heard one of the&#xD;
best salesmen in the house request a settle-&#xD;
ment. He inquired the cause of the disturb-&#xD;
ance, and Mr. Seliwell related what had hap-&#xD;
pened, with an occasional interruption from&#xD;
Mr. Crape.&#xD;
"I'm surprised, Mr. Sellwell," said Mr. Bar-&#xD;
ege, "that you should charge such an outrage-&#xD;
ous price."&#xD;
"The goods were marked low," replied Sam,&#xD;
"and well able to stand the price."&#xD;
"Well, I've no objection," said Mr. Barege,&#xD;
in a half reprovii~g tone, "that you should ask&#xD;
a fairprofit, but fourteen~ dollars out of thirty!&#xD;
Don't ~lo it again, Mr. SelIwell."&#xD;
"All right, sir."&#xD;
"By the way," said Mr. Barege, "you were&#xD;
~bsent three days last week, Mr. Sellwdll."&#xD;
"Yes, sir," replied Sam, with a solemn look,&#xD;
'my aunt in Jersey City was sick, and there&#xD;
being no one but servants there, I staid to&#xD;
Look after the old lady."&#xD;
"Ah! how came yo~ti on Broadway, Wednes-&#xD;
lay evening 7"&#xD;
"Wednesday? oh! yes," said' Sam, suddenly&#xD;
~emcmbering, "I came over to get some mcdi-&#xD;
~ine. The article ordered by the doctor could&#xD;
&#xD;
not be found in Jersey."&#xD;
"It must have been a new medicine," replied&#xD;
Mr. Barege, "since you had to go to a lager&#xD;

beer saloon for it! That will do, you can go to&#xD;
your stock, Mr. Seliwell, and I trust your aunt&#xD;
will not be sick again soon&#xD;
"Thank you, sir, I hope not," said Sam, very&#xD;
gravely.&#xD;
Mr. Crape, defeated in his attack on Seliwell,&#xD;
came out in the store and meeting Philip, who&#xD;
had been watching with interest all these dif-&#xD;
ferent scenes, thought to take revenge on the&#xD;
boy by ordering him to clean the windows.&#xD;
"That's not my work," said Philip&#xD;
"Oh! it is'nt, well I'll see," replied the irri-&#xD;
tated gentleman. Fortunately for Philip, Mr.&#xD;
Muslin, called him at this time and sent him&#xD;
off on an errand down town.&#xD;
Mr. Droll had been troubled with a cough&#xD;
for more than a year, which at times was so&#xD;
severe as to seriously frighten his friends. On&#xD;
this day he had suffered from it more than&#xD;
usual, and Seliwell, while he related to him&#xD;
the scene in the office felt worried at the signs&#xD;
of consumption that wore plainly traceable in&#xD;
his old friend.&#xD;
"Confound this cough," said Petet', "I believe&#xD;
i've got the consumption."&#xD;
"Oh! nonsense, Pete," replies Sam, conceal-&#xD;
ing his real feeling~, "you have caught cold,&#xD;
rake a good hot apple toddy when you go to&#xD;
bed to-night and you will be better to-mor-&#xD;
The next day was Sunday, and in the after-&#xD;
noon, as he had promised, Philip started out to&#xD;
pay a visit to Mary. lie took with him three&#xD;
or four of the best books he had, which he in-&#xD;
tended to loan to his young friend to read.&#xD;
The day w svery pleasant, calm and still, the&#xD;
very air s~en3ing to know that the day was&#xD;
boly, and t~ hang with a mellowed brightness&#xD;
over the ci y of churches; a few fleecy clouds&#xD;
were movi g slowly through tl~e heavens,&#xD;
while the un gave a cheering brightness to&#xD;
all around, without an oppressive or glaring&#xD;
heat. Phi ip was so pleased with the serene&#xD;
and happy scenes about him, that without no-&#xD;
tiziing his progress he passed the street he&#xD;
should ha e turned into, and did not discover&#xD;
his mistake until he arrived at Foi~t Green.&#xD;
Turning to retrace his steps, he was hailed by&#xD;
a familiar voice and was then joined by Mr.&#xD;
Droll, who inquired where he was going.&#xD;
Philip urged his friend to join him in paying&#xD;
a visit to Mrs. Collins' house, and dwelt so ad-&#xD;
miringly on Mary's beauty and goodness, that&#xD;
Mr. Droll consented.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mary answered their 'knock at the door and&#xD;
received them with a childish ease and grace&#xD;
that pleased Mr. Droll very much, and when&#xD;
Mrs. Collins welcomed them in' her kind and&#xD;
gentle way, he felt himself quite at home.&#xD;
Philip and Mary were soon engaged with the&#xD;
freedom of children, looking over the books he&#xD;
had brought, examining the modest ornaments&#xD;
of the room, and discussing the different sub-&#xD;
jects that occurred to their minds. Mr. Droll&#xD;
and Mrs. Collins, were equally interested in&#xD;
the conversation that passed between them-&#xD;
selves. He was a native of Aberdeenshire,&#xD;
Scotland, and she was from the Glens of An-&#xD;
trim, in the ever green Isle, and a comparison&#xD;
of the two countries, with 'a relation of the&#xD;
many incidents of childhood that still dwelt&#xD;
bright in their memories, made the time pass&#xD;
pleasantly away, and caused them before the&#xD;
evening was over to feel a friendship for each&#xD;
other that it might have taken years to create,&#xD;
under different circumstances. The visit was&#xD;
s~ agreeable, in fact, that Mr. Droll was&#xD;
pleased with the invitation given to call again.&#xD;
his Sunday walks thereafter usually included,&#xD;
a visit to Mrs. Collinsand frequently during the&#xD;
week he would stop in for a few moments. At&#xD;
these times he took great pleasure in assisting&#xD;
Mary with l~er studies, and often brought her&#xD;
books that he thought would be useful or en-&#xD;
tertaining. He was fond of music, and as an&#xD;
amateur, was considered an excellent per-&#xD;
former on the piano, violin or flute, the latter&#xD;
of which he sometimess brought with 'him, and&#xD;
varied their amusements with music. Philip&#xD;
usually acco i~panied Mr. Droll in his visits to&#xD;
Mrs. Collins, or was there before him. He now&#xD;
took more interest in reading and iA studying&#xD;
with Marytlian he had ever done at schooland&#xD;
as Mr. Droll always included him in his in-&#xD;
structions, often jokingly said that he was&#xD;
now attending college and that when he grad-.&#xD;
uated he expected to get a Droll diploma.&#xD;
CIJAPTETI yirr.&#xD;
Although it is a common saying that "the&#xD;
age of miracle~ has past," and we no longer~&#xD;
find the kings and rulers of Christian coun-&#xD;
tries, or their statesmen and lawgivers, wise&#xD;
judges and men versed in science and lit~ra-&#xD;
tine, consulting sooth-sayers and astrologist~,&#xD;
asking of them the unveiling of the future, and&#xD;
&#xD;
MARDI GRAS;&#xD;
&#xD;
yielding to their predietitins implicit belief&#xD;
and to their mandates a blind obedience, yet&#xD;
we find the descendants or Successors of thi.&#xD;
mysterious men of science who flourished in&#xD;
the middle ages, still practicing the arts and&#xD;
wiles of the profession. Whether it is that&#xD;
imposters and illiterate persons have degraded&#xD;
the once noble art, or that the world has be-&#xD;
come so practical as to regard all pursuits as&#xD;
mere trades and matters of business, or that&#xD;
the superior intelligeuce of the age has dis-&#xD;
covered it to be the veriest humbug, which&#xD;
ought to be exploded, certain it is that the&#xD;
professors who pursue it are no longer looked&#xD;
upon with that respect and superstitious awe&#xD;
that characterized their lives in "the good old&#xD;
days." Yet there are many of them who do a&#xD;
very lively business, and amass immense for-&#xD;
tunes-the test in these latter days of success&#xD;
and deserving character. They have their fol-&#xD;
lowers, who pay profound reverence to their&#xD;
powers, their' visitors from curiosity, and&#xD;
through the credulity, hopes, fears and ridi-&#xD;
cule of the world, hold their authority and&#xD;
reap their harvest.&#xD;
Madame Clementine Pavalio,, was one of the&#xD;
most celebrated fortune tellers, and astrolo-&#xD;
gists of the city. She understood her calling&#xD;
to a nicety, and while she advertised extensive-&#xD;
ly, her cards and circulars were so well word-&#xD;
ed, and her appeals so judiciously made, that&#xD;
even those who ridiculed the idea of belief in&#xD;
such a science, were drawn through curiosity&#xD;
to visit her rooms. She claimed to treat her&#xD;
subject scientifically, and with new and im-&#xD;
proved apparatus to assist her, she read the&#xD;
past, present and future, assisted in consum-&#xD;
mating matrimonial engagements, gave a like-&#xD;
ness and told the disposition of the future&#xD;
husband or wife of the applicant. She des-&#xD;
cribed the friends and pointedout the enemies&#xD;
of her visitors, and warned them of the dan-&#xD;
~ers hanging over the future. She oft~n gave&#xD;
information that led to the arrest of thieves,&#xD;
and defaulters, and the recovery of articles&#xD;
stolen; many of her exploits in this line bad&#xD;
been important in their results, and these with&#xD;
the facility and accuracy with which she had&#xD;
read the past lives of some of her most im-&#xD;
portant clients had gained for her a wide rep-&#xD;
utation and left a deep inipression on 4he&#xD;
minds of a few of the most incredulous. If&#xD;
they had been allowed a peep behind the scenes,&#xD;
as we shall presently take, their wonder would&#xD;
have been much abated.&#xD;
&#xD;
tier residence was a brown stone front house&#xD;
of imposing appearance, near Broadway, on an&#xD;
up-town street, and the silver knob to the door-&#xD;
bell, was encircled b~- a handsome band of the&#xD;
same metal, bearing in plain, but not over-&#xD;
grown letters, the name, Madame Clementine&#xD;
Pavalio. On one side of the spacious hail, b~&#xD;
which the house was entered, there hung a&#xD;
ina~nificent oil painting of Puck, starting oii&#xD;
a mission to' girdle the earth, while opposite&#xD;
* there stood a marble statue representing for-&#xD;
tune in the, act of emptying her horn of plenty.&#xD;
The consultation room, which looked out upon&#xD;
the street, was large, with high ceilingsand the&#xD;
high windows that reached nearly from floor&#xD;
to ceiling were shaded by elegant lace and da-&#xD;
mask curtains. The furniture was of elaborate&#xD;
pattern, rosewood and satin, of the finest&#xD;
quality and newest styles. On the mantle-&#xD;
piece, which was loaded down with costly or-&#xD;
naments, there was an upright card ease of&#xD;
motherof pearl, supported by a pedestal of pure&#xD;
g~d, and in this the cards of fortune were&#xD;
placed, after being shuffled for dealing. On an&#xD;
elegant marble top center table there stood a&#xD;
miniature globe, on which all the countries of&#xD;
the earth were delineated with accuracy and&#xD;
in the best style of art. A large pier glass&#xD;
was placed between the windows, opposite to&#xD;
which was the horoscope of destiny, so con-&#xD;
trived that while the visitor unsuspectingly&#xD;
looked into it, the astrologist quickly took&#xD;
their photograph, whlch could be afterwards&#xD;
used, either to gather more particulars about&#xD;
the principal, or to send to some distant cor-&#xD;
respondent, as the likeness of a future partner&#xD;
in life,&#xD;
On one of the sofas in this room a man was&#xD;
cisurely reclining, while n&amp;amp;ar him in an arm&#xD;
chair the renowned fortune-teller was sitting.&#xD;
lie had evidently just come in, and stretched&#xD;
himself wearily out, while she in a compass&#xD;
sionating tone said,&#xD;
"You seem weary, my dear."&#xD;
"I am weary, and what's more, I am worried&#xD;
and disgusted with this interminable search.&#xD;
It is first one track and then another, and en-&#xD;
~irely different one, all leading to-nothing."&#xD;
"Well, my dear, you get paid all the same,&#xD;
don't you I"&#xD;
"Yes, oh, yes! but that is not nil a m~in&#xD;
works for. I get paid liberally, but then' I&#xD;
could make just as much working up the pri-&#xD;
vate cases that would come to me, if I was free&#xD;
to take them, and then there would be variety,&#xD;

had this one case since the year after we were&#xD;
married, and I am no nearer success than when&#xD;
I first took it."&#xD;
"It is strange," replied his wife, who wore&#xD;
her high sounding foreign name only for busi-&#xD;
ness purposes, but w~s Mrs. Williams in pri-&#xD;
vate, "that Mr. MacVain does not tire of this&#xD;
fruitless search."&#xD;
"Not he 1" exclaimed the detective, "I never&#xD;
saw such a man! Disappointment only sharp-&#xD;
ens iiis desire for success, and drives him into&#xD;
new channels and on to new plans.~~&#xD;
'lYhy is MacVain so anxious about the re-&#xD;
covt~ry of this child; was she a relative of&#xD;
his?"&#xD;
"ho-I thix~k not. There's some terrible&#xD;
n:y~tery about it and it is fast wearing him to&#xD;
the grave. I 1~hiuk from the way he talks and&#xD;
th&amp;amp;weight it is on his mind that he either stole&#xD;
the child or had it done 7"&#xD;
"He did? What could induce him to do&#xD;
that 7"&#xD;
"I ~dou't know, perhaps money-may be it&#xD;
was done to conceal the child's birth, though&#xD;
if it had been that she would have been stolen&#xD;
before she was two years old. He~s the deep-&#xD;
est man I ever got hold of; you can't find out&#xD;
much that he don't want you to know, and if&#xD;
you do think you've struck a trail, you never&#xD;
know whether you are right or not."&#xD;
"If h~ would come here, I might l~ad him&#xD;
by prophesy 1o do as you wish."&#xD;
"Yes, but he would not come here. He&#xD;
would h~ot at the idea of consulting a fortune-&#xD;
teller, and I would not hazard my reputation&#xD;
with him by such a proposition."&#xD;
"No, it would not do for you to do that-]&#xD;
only wish he would come of his own accord&#xD;
As it is, why don't you throw up the engage&#xD;
ment 7'?&#xD;
"I can't do that very well. I've hinted thai&#xD;
way several times, but MacVain is never wil&#xD;
hug to listen to such a thing, and he has beer&#xD;
so liberal with nie, that I could not honorable&#xD;
drop the case against his will. This matcl&#xD;
girl he thinks is the child he islookingfor, an.:&#xD;
that belief has raised his hopes higher thai&#xD;
ever before.".&#xD;
"And you cannot find her 7"&#xD;
"Find her! You might as well look for:&#xD;

and MacVain only saw her once, and way have&#xD;
given me a very poor description of her."&#xD;
"Yet it is strange you can find no trace of&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"It is, indeed, and baffles inc entirely. I wish&#xD;
MacVain would drop the case. I would wil-&#xD;
lingly give up the chance of earning the hand-&#xD;
some reward that is promised on the successful&#xD;
conclusion of our search."&#xD;
The door bell was rung at this moment&#xD;
and to avoid the visitor, if it should be some&#xD;
one wishing to consult the Madame, Mr. \Yil-&#xD;
hams retired into an adjoining room, and the&#xD;
servant announced that a gentleman wished&#xD;
to s~e the Madame. She was ordered to admit&#xD;
him, and a moment afterwards ushered in Mr.&#xD;
MacVain, which' astonished the fortune-teller,&#xD;
the more, because he had been the subject of&#xD;
her late conversation with her husband.&#xD;
Recovering from her surprise, she invited&#xD;
him to be seated, and awaited the disclosure&#xD;
of his business, in dignified si~euce. MacVain&#xD;
east a searching look around ~he room, noti-&#xD;
cing the magnificent furniture and elegant or-&#xD;
nanients with indifference, bu when his eyes&#xD;
fell on the instruments of her science, a sneer&#xD;
culled his lips as he said:&#xD;
"I suppose you think I have ome to consult&#xD;
you about the future, to ask y u if my star of&#xD;
destiny shines brightly and ge you to unfold&#xD;
the past, present and future, t my wondering&#xD;
eyes."&#xD;
"It is neither just or wise," she replied~&#xD;
heartily, "to mock at that which we do not&#xD;
understand and have never tested."&#xD;
"Do not think.that you can impose on&#xD;
'he replied, his eyes flashing with resentment&#xD;
at her rebuke. "You could tell me nothing of&#xD;
- the past that would be pleasant to hear, the&#xD;
present 's open before me, and the future is&#xD;
hung with a veil as impenetrable to you as to&#xD;
- myself-no, I want none of your eight seeing&#xD;
or witchcraft."&#xD;
"I know you too well," she replied, careless-&#xD;
ly, turning the miniature globe on its axis, "to&#xD;
I suppose that you come with any belief in my&#xD;
powers-Percy MacVain is a cynic in human&#xD;
affairs, a neglected, almost an apostate in re-&#xD;
ligion, and believes i~i nothing firmly-except&#xD;
~ his own infallibility~"&#xD;
"MacVain started with surprise when he&#xD;
heard his own name thus announced, and the&#xD;
flush of anger deepened on his face as she pro-&#xD;
nounced her estimate of his character.&#xD;

"You were born rich and proud," she contia&#xD;
ned, apparently indifferent to his resentment&#xD;
"wayward,, self-willed and unrestrained, you&#xD;
grew up, with a mind stored with the wealth&#xD;
of science, literature and the flue arts, a posi&#xD;
tion in the highest social circles of the ~world,&#xD;
and a fortune almost unlimited; you have used&#xD;
your advantages for your own gratification&#xD;
and pleasure, never caring whose heart was&#xD;
torn or life blighted, so that your ends were&#xD;
gained.~&#xD;
"'Tis false," he exclaimed, stamping h~ feet&#xD;
angrily. "I did not come here to be insulted&#xD;
wit~h your Impertinent surmises about my&#xD;
character."&#xD;
I was surprised at the amJunt of knowl-&#xD;

mor galling as they were so nearly true.&#xD;
" told you,~~ he continued, endeavoring to&#xD;
eon ol his feelings, "when I came iii that I&#xD;

"you wish me to help you in finding alittlegiri&#xD;
who was stolen from her parents in New Or-&#xD;
leans, and who it is your duty to see returned&#xD;
to her home."&#xD;
MacVain could not conceal his surprise&#xD;
when Madame Pavalie gave this further proof&#xD;
of her knowledge of his affairs, and although a&#xD;
man of strong mind, he was for the moment&#xD;
shaken in his disbelief of her science, lie&#xD;
therefore quietly~answered:&#xD;
"Well...-and if I did I"&#xD;
"I cannot assist 'you now," she replied, "the&#xD;
time has not come yet."&#xD;
"Oh! you cannot," he said, the old sneer re-&#xD;
turning to hi~ lips, "I thought you could rea4&#xD;

"The dispositions and intellects of men dif.&#xD;

spQke, "so it is with the scroll on which is&#xD;
written their future destiny; some lie open be-&#xD;

can be read by them, err, either through inten-&#xD;

this latter class."&#xD;
&#xD;
27&#xD;
&#xD;
-   "With the fine points of your science I have&#xD;
nothing to do," replied MacVain, "I want your&#xD;
assistance to find this lost child."&#xD;
"it would be useless for me to try now,"&#xD;
she replied, "the lines of your destiny and of&#xD;
hers lie far apart and diverging. You have&#xD;
seen a girl of the same name, a match girl; she&#xD;
is not the child you want to find. No, you&#xD;
need not shake your head. I am right, and if&#xD;
you find this watch girl you will then know&#xD;
that I am."&#xD;
"Well, you give no encouragement," he said,&#xD;
"and would seem to aim at dissuading me&#xD;
from a farther search."&#xD;
"Your further search will prove ~&#xD;
she replied. "I may tell you more at another&#xD;
time, but just now your chart of destiny is not&#xD;
very plain."&#xD;
"You know that I do not believe in your&#xD;
reve~atiohs of the future."&#xD;
"That I cannot help, my reading of the past&#xD;
you know to be true, time will jirovo my cor-&#xD;
rectness ahout the future."&#xD;
"'And you say that I will never find t~he&#xD;
child?"&#xD;
She did not reply for some minu~cs, but sat&#xD;
intently studying~the little globe as it revolved,&#xD;
then going to the mantelpiece she took down&#xD;
the card case, and as ~lie pack it contained was&#xD;
slightly soiled, she took from the drawer ofata-&#xD;
ble a fresh one. These cards were made in the&#xD;
highest style of art, the edges were gilded and&#xD;
the backs ornamented with fine steel engrav&#xD;
ings of mythological subjects. After shuffling&#xD;
them well, she placed them in the case beside&#xD;
the globe on the table and again took her seat&#xD;
opposite to MacVain. As the globe slowly re-&#xD;
volved she drew the cards from the case, and&#xD;
laying them out on the table, read to him in a&#xD;
studied manner:&#xD;
"The woman with whom you plated this&#xD;
child." she said, "died without leaving you&#xD;
any clue as to what had been done with her.&#xD;
The child is ~vel1 and has grown very rapidly.&#xD;
She does not now live in this city. Yen have&#xD;
met her and spoken to her." MacVain started&#xD;
an~ then leaned eagerly forward, while she&#xD;
continued, "you will meet her again and often,&#xD;
hut you will not know her. Your inquiries&#xD;
will be without success, and you will meet her&#xD;
where you least expect it."&#xD;
"I will speak to her and associate with&#xD;

"You kave spoken \to her," she replied, and&#xD;
.mfter a pause added, "and will speak to her,&#xD;
but will not know who she is. There-see&#xD;
tb~se cards are all black and mixed suits; I am&#xD;
not therefore able now to tell more with cer-&#xD;

"You think then," he asked, "that I will&#xD;
never find her ~"&#xD;
"That you will see and speak to her again,&#xD;
is certain," she replied, but I think yon will&#xD;
never know her. Ah! the queen of hearts and&#xD;
jack of diamonds, that is blood! Beware!&#xD;
there is a cloud here, and if you continue, it&#xD;
will lead tq great trouble-yes, to bloodshed."&#xD;
"Madame, if I believed what you have said,"&#xD;
he replied, "I should be the most miserable of&#xD;
men. But I a n confident of success I must&#xD;
be successful, or until I sin so, I can never be&#xD;
happy."&#xD;
"If you find er at all," she answered, "it&#xD;
will be many y ars hence, but I do nut think&#xD;
you will find er, and, therefore, advise you&#xD;
to give lip the ifort."&#xD;
"Not I! by t me light of my soul, I will pur-&#xD;

tracted and a look of unalterable firmness set-&#xD;
tled on his face.&#xD;
"Perhaps you will assist me," he said, as he&#xD;
arose to go, "if so, I will pay you well."&#xD;
"No, no, no, I can not," she replied, drawing&#xD;
back, "there is blood between you and her,&#xD;
and I doubt if ever you will succeed. The&#xD;
danger that awaits you may engulf those as-&#xD;
sociated kvith you, and, therefore, I decline the&#xD;
offer, no matter what the rew~ird."&#xD;
"Very good, as you please," he replied,&#xD;
smiling at her earnestness, and then he laid&#xD;
on the table a sum of money that, he thought,&#xD;
would be sufficient to pay for the interview.&#xD;
"Good bye, Madame, I may call and see you&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"I hope you will," she replied, as she re-&#xD;
turned his bow, and a servant conducted him&#xD;
out.&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
The ties of home are strong and almost uni-&#xD;
versal. The heart turns from the cares of the&#xD;
&#xD;
world, the rude jostling of the busy crowds,&#xD;
the continual jingle of money and the pursuit&#xD;
of the ever needful dollar, from the over tasked&#xD;
brain, the weary limbs,~ and the dull, drowsy&#xD;
plodding of the day-from all such over-hang-&#xD;
ing clouds the heart turns a way to seek bright&#xD;
visions of joy, amidst the groves and walks,&#xD;
the vine-hung cottage, or, it may be, the ever-&#xD;
recurring, hot and cheerless side-walks, and&#xD;
piles of brick and mortar that mak6 up a city,&#xD;
where once, in a happier time, home was&#xD;
known. The feeling is confined to no class or&#xD;
nation; rich and poor alikeare haunted by it,.&#xD;
for it seems to be innate in the human breast.&#xD;
As "distance lends en6hantment to the ~&#xD;
when looking upon the works of nature, the&#xD;
majestic hills, the spreading valleys, and the&#xD;
limpid, running water, so time softens the&#xD;
memory of the past, and there are few passages&#xD;
in life, however hard and toilsome, which,&#xD;
viewed aftenthe lapse of years, have no pleas-&#xD;
ant visions intermingled with their trials, that&#xD;
make the heart exclaim, "Ah, those were the&#xD;
g od old days!" Thusthe mantle of oblivion&#xD;
is cast around the sorrows of life, obliterating&#xD;
th ir pain, or mellowing them down, so that&#xD;
th joys that came with them stand above and&#xD;
ov rehadowing theinfi with a tranquil, holy&#xD;
li ht, that causes us to look back with mingled&#xD;
pan and pleasure. A few years hence, and to-&#xD;
da will be counted in "the good old time,"&#xD;
an if we could but realize this fact, so as to&#xD;
se son our lives with contentment, how much&#xD;
greater would be the pleasures of this life,&#xD;
how much lighter its burdens.&#xD;
When Cecelia first arrived in Boston, she&#xD;
was delighted with all she saw. The new&#xD;
scenes, strange faces, manners and customs,&#xD;
made a variety that, for the time, engaged her&#xD;
whole attention. She soon became acquainted&#xD;
*ith other children of her own class, and with&#xD;
some of these took up her abode. In this way&#xD;
she passed the next few mouths, making ex&#xD;
cursions to Cambridge, Roxbrury, Maiden and&#xD;
the neighborhood, always peddling some sort&#xD;
of wares with very great success. When the&#xD;
summer had passed away and the autumn was&#xD;
deepening into winter, this roaming about be-&#xD;
came less agreeable, often trying and painful,&#xD;
and she began to talk of New York as home,&#xD;
and of returning to it. With her it needed but&#xD;
the resolntion; no ties bound her, no dear&#xD;
friends by love and kindness, caused a sigh of&#xD;
regret at parting.&#xD;

frontery that knew no shame, others, advanced&#xD;
in years, were yet mare modest in their de-&#xD;
meaner. There were young girls, tender in&#xD;
years and delicately formed, who seemed to be&#xD;
gliding, more swiftly than the others, down&#xD;
that dark and terrible road of ruin, below&#xD;
shame, lost to honor, eyond hope, far, far be-&#xD;
yond the pale of la~ and affection. One of&#xD;
these he noticed particularly, a. little childl,&#xD;
with a thin, pale face, where .hunger and&#xD;
neglect had left; deep traces, the dark eyes&#xD;
shining out from the ashen paleness that sur-&#xD;
rounded them, with a fierce, unnatural light,&#xD;
her thin calico dress driven close to her form&#xD;
'by the chilling wind that swept down the&#xD;
street, and as she went by, a ,small voice&#xD;
within his breast seemed to say,| " Is it here,&#xD;
Percy MacVain, that you would look for the&#xD;
victim of your malice Is the delicate child,&#xD;
torn by you from the embrace of a loving&#xD;
mother, one of these Have you taken her&#xD;
from a home where every influence would tend&#xD;
to virtue, honor and refinement, that she&#xD;
might fall into this road of misery, want and&#xD;
crime But for you she would have been sur-&#xD;

have torn from the influence of rel igion, from&#xD;
the love and reverence of God, .and placed on&#xD;
the high road to -degradation and shame !" -&#xD;
As these thoughts coursed through his brain,&#xD;
ever returning when he strove to shake them&#xD;
off, one of the women stopped him, and asaed&#xD;
for charity in God's name.. Pulling forth a&#xD;
dollar, he gave it to her. Thanking him, she&#xD;
went on, and he, prompted by curiosity, fol-&#xD;
lowed. Going up Broadway, before reaching&#xD;
Canal street, she turned to the left, and de-&#xD;
scended into the under-ground story of the&#xD;
corner house.&#xD;
The room he entered" was entirely under-&#xD;
ground, the story above was occupied as a no-&#xD;
tion store, this was a bar room, fitted up in&#xD;
handsome style. Passing through this, Mac-&#xD;
Vain found himself in a long room, resembling&#xD;
a cave, which was immediately under the side..&#xD;
walk of Broeadway. It was occupied as a&#xD;
shooting gallery, and as he stood there, sur-'&#xD;
veying the rough appearance of the place, a&#xD;
young man, holding up a pistol, good natured-&#xD;
ly asked him if he would take a shot. This&#xD;
was Mr. Samuel Sellwell, who, having finished&#xD;
&#xD;
I GRAS;&#xD;
&#xD;
his day's work, was out for a little recreation.&#xD;
MacVain surveyed the stranger for a moment&#xD;
with a distrustful look, but the good natured&#xD;
face of Sam overcame his repugnance to recog-&#xD;
nizing such chance companions.&#xD;
" I seldom shoot at such a mark," he replied,&#xD;
pointing to the figure on the iron screen, "but&#xD;
your challenge comes with so much confidence&#xD;
that I will try it."&#xD;
" Oh, I don't pretend to be an extra shot,"&#xD;
replied Sam, "but I like the amusement of the&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"Very well," said MacVain, pointing to the&#xD;
keeper, a lame man, who went about with a&#xD;
long step and a short one, "this gentleman&#xD;
shall call for us, and we will fire in turns at&#xD;
the word.?'                          ,&#xD;
" At the word!" exclaimed Sam, " I never&#xD;
fired that way in my life."   .-&#xD;
"It is the only way to have any amusement,"&#xD;
said MacVain, " and I never shoot in any&#xD;
other way,-but, as you say you prefer a steady&#xD;
aim, you can fire as you like, and I will fire at&#xD;
the call." .&#xD;
Each one had three shots, and, as it was&#xD;
agreed that Sam should try first, he took his&#xD;
place, and, after a short aim, fired. One of his&#xD;
shots struck the pivot, ringing the bell, and&#xD;
the other two were less than a quarter of an&#xD;
inch from  it. MacVain fired at 'the word,-&#xD;
-without care or hesitation, two of his shots&#xD;
ringing the bell and the other touched the&#xD;
spring, but too lightly to stir the bell.&#xD;
" Well done, well done," cried Sam, " let's&#xD;
try it over."&#xD;
" That's not good shooting," said MacVair,&#xD;
" at least down our way we would think it&#xD;
poor-only one shot was fairly in the centre."&#xD;
"I don't think you can beat it," replied Sam.&#xD;
" Oh, yes I can," said MacVain, smiling,&#xD;
" that would never do in pigeon and squirrel&#xD;
hunting."&#xD;
" If you are dry,"~ said Sam, confidently, "we&#xD;
will take something on it that you don't beat&#xD;
it this time."&#xD;
" I am no~ much in the humor for drinking,&#xD;
replied MacVain, who yet felt as if he us&#xD;
vindicate his skill with the weapon, " but I&#xD;
will take your challenge."&#xD;
Sam took his place, aimed with extra care,&#xD;
an4l rang the bell with his first two shots, but&#xD;
success and eagerness to do well made him aim&#xD;
a little unsteady, and the third shot missed the&#xD;
centre by the smallest fraction of distance.'&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"That was very well done, for a steady aim,'"&#xD;
said MacVain, who now took his position, and&#xD;
as tihe word was given,rfired with a quick butl&#xD;
::areful aim. His three shots rang the bell,&#xD;
two of them striking fair in the center.&#xD;
" By Jove, that is good shooting!" exclaimed&#xD;
&#xD;
si&#xD;

&#xD;
Sam'.&#xD;
"First rate! splendid !" exclaimed the keep-&#xD;
er, with an admiring look at MacVain-.&#xD;
" What will you drink, sir I" asked Sam-.&#xD;
"Exduse me," replied MacVain, "I really&#xD;
don't feel like taking anything."&#xD;
"Oh, that will never do," said Sam, "you&#xD;
must take something. Come -now, it's a cold&#xD;
night, take a hot Tom and Jerry; of all the&#xD;
places in New York, this is the -best for Tom&#xD;
and Jervy."&#xD;
"Very well," said MacVain, yielding reluct-&#xD;
antly to Sanm's importunity.&#xD;
They rang the bell and gave the order to the&#xD;
servant when he came, Sam in his good nature&#xD;
including the keeper in the order. The foam-.&#xD;
ing beverage, smoking hot, was compounded&#xD;
just right, and they all pronounced it the best&#xD;
they had ever tasted.&#xD;
After finishing his glass, MacVain said 1 ea&#xD;
must go, and Sam replied that he had stayed&#xD;
long enough himself and would go a short dis-&#xD;
tance with him. As MacVain return d to the&#xD;
bar room, he looked about him again, wonder&#xD;
ing where the woman had gone that he was&#xD;
following when he entered the place. -&#xD;
" You are a stranger here P' said Sam, in-&#xD;
quiringly.&#xD;
" I am not a citizen of New York," replied&#xD;
MacVain, " but I have spent a great deal of&#xD;
time here."   |-&#xD;
" Come this way," said Sam, taking his arm&#xD;
and drawing himn towards the side street, "Il&#xD;
show you a sight, the like of which you never&#xD;
saw before."&#xD;
They passed through the door into a long,&#xD;
narrow passage or hall, under the sidewalk of&#xD;
the side street. Along this was ranged a&#xD;
dozen or more stalls or small apartments,&#xD;
separated by a thin board partition, and all&#xD;
having a door opening into the hall. In each&#xD;
one of these there was a' long, rough table,&#xD;
with benches running a round it for seats.&#xD;
When MacVain entered this place he started&#xD;
back with horror at the sight that met his&#xD;
eyes. The hall was crowded with women like&#xD;
those he had seen on Broadway, who had taken&#xD;
refuge here from the cold of the street. Some&#xD;
&#xD;
were laughing andL relating their experiences&#xD;
of the night with loud words and rude jests,&#xD;
others were singing the rough street songs of&#xD;
the day, others were'in the stalls, indulging in&#xD;
such drinks and refreshments as their scahty&#xD;
means would afford, while many were loung-&#xD;
ing around, waiting for the appearance of some&#xD;
one from whom they could beg the means to&#xD;
pay for something to satisfy their hunger or&#xD;
thirst.&#xD;
'When the men entered a crowil gathered&#xD;
around them, asking for. some refreshments.&#xD;
All sorts of drinks'and an endless variety of&#xD;
dishes were suggested by* these, each one&#xD;
urging her clai heaconsideran ngrd Mac-&#xD;
witnessed.&#xD;
"Take care, get out of the way," said a&#xD;
young girl, pushing the others aside and pre-&#xD;
senting herself before him, " this is a friend of&#xD;
nine, and I know he'll stand treat for the&#xD;
crowd, if you will only keep quiet."&#xD;
.M God ! Cecelia, you here !" exclaimed&#xD;
MacVain.&#xD;
" Yes, it's me," replied the girl, much sur-&#xD;
"prised that he should remember her, then half&#xD;
fearing that he would demand a return of the&#xD;
money she had cheated him out of,. she re-&#xD;
gretted having spoken. t6 him. If she had&#xD;
known how little he valued money, or yet, if&#xD;
an idea of why he felt so strong an interest in&#xD;
her had crossed her mind, she would have had&#xD;
no such feeling. Remembering how his sombre&#xD;
manner had impressed the girl before, and be-&#xD;
lieving that it was the cause of her not return-&#xD;
ing to him the following day, hie resolved not&#xD;
to awaken her suspicion by questioning her&#xD;
too closely, or frighten her away by a reproof&#xD;
for being in such company. Assuming a care-&#xD;
less freedom he was far from feeling, he ordered&#xD;
one of the waiters to take the orders of the&#xD;
crowd, and requested Sellwell to join them.&#xD;
That gentleman was astonished at this change&#xD;
in his companion, with whose reserved and&#xD;
dignified manner he had been deeply impress-&#xD;
ed. Nothing in the city was new to him, how-&#xD;
ever, and-he accepted the invitation with a&#xD;
cordial approbation.&#xD;
" How have you been 1" asked MacVain, ad-&#xD;
dressing Cecelia.&#xD;
"I've been bully, never was sick in my life,"&#xD;
repied the glirl,&#xD;
"ot palive in Brooklyn 1" he said after a&#xD;

&#xD;
"No, I don't," she replied, an then the feel-&#xD;
ing of distrust returning, she dded, "I live&#xD;
in Williamsburg."&#xD;
!' Oh I you do I" said MacVain, thinking that&#xD;
he had gained one point, "what part of Wil-&#xD;
liamsburg I"&#xD;
"Two squares from the ing's County&#xD;
Hotel," sbe replied.&#xD;
MacVain did not want to qu stion her too&#xD;
closely, lest he should anger or frighten her,&#xD;
and, therefore, after a short time he withdr-ew,&#xD;
followed by Sellwell.&#xD;
"That's some of New York under ground,"&#xD;
said Seliwell, as they stood on the corner of the&#xD;
street.&#xD;
"A disorderly crowd," r~iplied MacVain, "and&#xD;
much to be pitied."&#xD;
"That's so," rejylied Sam, glancing at his&#xD;
watch. "A quarter to ten, well, I'll bid you&#xD;
good night, sir."&#xD;
"Good night," rejylied MacVain, and they&#xD;
~mparated.&#xD;
&#xD;
CIIAPTElI X.&#xD;
Soon after MacVain left the saloon, Cecelia&#xD;
remembered her engagement with her friends&#xD;
at Sanderbund's and- took her departure also.&#xD;
The room was in the same order, or disorder,&#xD;
as when she occupied it before. The few ar-&#xD;
tides that she bad disposed of so Sanderbund&#xD;
bad been rented to the other occupants of the&#xD;
room.. The old table was well covered with&#xD;
dishes for th~ evening's entertainment, oysters&#xD;
in several.st~les, beefsteak, a chicken salad,&#xD;
&#xD;
with an abundance of bread, claret wine and brealt aown br mom.&#xD;
draught ale, being the principal attractions'  "Jake, how much does it cost to go to New.&#xD;
to which was added, later in the evening, a Orleans I" asked Cecelia, when the noise sub-&#xD;

The company consisted of Cecelia's old friends, "Depends on how you go," replied Jake. "It&#xD;
~'elly and Sally, who were still inmates of the you manage right, you can sponge your way&#xD;
room, and Betsy and Jake, who cuinae up from nearly all through, and if you pay it will&#xD;

make merry and help themselves, a request "What do you know about it~?" said Betsy,&#xD;
which each one proceeded to obey without fur- who had been taking liberally of the whiskey&#xD;

"I'm glad to see you back, Ceely," sai~Jalte,  "I know, 'cos Dick told me," sa d Jake, "and&#xD;
with his mouth full.                     yo~b~ttOr bold your jaw, you ha ."&#xD;
"You're eatin' as if you were," said Betsy,  "Oh! yes," replied Betsy, be~ een a cry and&#xD;
contemptuously.                          a storm of'rsge, "get upaquarr 1 now, you're&#xD;
always picking  me,           pdiug fault.&#xD;
Come, Betsy," replied Cecelia, "let him "Hush up now~," said Jake, "y u're 4runk-&#xD;
eat, that's what I want him to do and you too." as usual-"&#xD;
&#xD;
About one o'clock in the morning, the wind&#xD;
lulled a little, although still very high and the&#xD;
air seemed to grow more intensely cold, every&#xD;
thing was freezing hard and fast. The police-&#xD;
men drew their great coats close about them&#xD;
and bugged close to the corner and friendly&#xD;
door-ways. Such citizens as were yet on~ the&#xD;
streets hurried on their way, bending over as&#xD;
they went, thus to catch less of the wind, and&#xD;
drawingg their bodies close together, so it&#xD;
~eemed, to avoid the piercing cold, while their&#xD;
breath turned to ice, covering their comfor-&#xD;
Less, mufflers and collars as they went quickly&#xD;
~n. Save by these few passers, the streets&#xD;
were quiet, and for once the great city seemed&#xD;
:o be u~sleep.&#xD;
Suddenly there came a gleam of light against,&#xD;

"If I had money," said Jake, after a deep  a chair.&#xD;
drink of the ale, "Pd go ~                   "No, I ain't," replied the girl.&#xD;
" What would you do South I" inquired      "Won't you ?" sa'd he, raising the chair&#xD;
Betsy.                                     over his head, when Cecelia stepped in he-&#xD;
"Do? I'd beg, or sing, or meddle something,"  twoen theni.&#xD;

the sky, scarcely perceptible at first, and then&#xD;
a glare shown over the district near the Tombs,&#xD;
while from all around the loud voices of the~&#xD;
watchmen raised and reiterated the cry 0?&#xD;
"Fire? Fire? Fire I"&#xD;
Then came the ding, 4ong, clatter, bang, of&#xD;
the bells, and in less time than it would take&#xD;
to tell it, half-a-dozen engines, followed by the&#xD;
brave and devoted men who were to man them,&#xD;
were rushing through the streets, with the&#xD;
speed of race horses, indifferent to the pier-&#xD;
cing cold. Now down Center street they come,&#xD;
then around the corner, and in a moment more&#xD;
the first stream of water 18 playing against&#xD;
the walls of Sanderbund's tenement Louse.&#xD;
Another and another company came quickly&#xD;
upon the scene, until the whole available&#xD;
force of the department Was on the ground&#xD;
and hard at work.&#xD;
"Now boys, hurry up, for God's sake don't&#xD;
let us be last," cried a man, fire bat in band,&#xD;
running along the line of men of a Hook and&#xD;
Ladder Company. The company dashed along,&#xD;
onwalid, faster and faster until they arrived at&#xD;
the scene of the fire.&#xD;
"Now loosen them ladders quick," said the&#xD;
foreman, the same man who had encouraged&#xD;
them on the road down.&#xD;
"Where do you want them, Seliwell ?"&#xD;
"Get 'em oil and we'll see," answered the&#xD;
foreman -our old dry goods friend, Sam Sell-&#xD;
well.&#xD;
-' Bring one of yer ladders over here, Sam,"&#xD;
said the forenian of one of the engine com-&#xD;
panies, "here's a woman in the third story."&#xD;
The fire had commenced, it seemed, in the&#xD;
lower story, and must have worked with won-&#xD;
derful rapidity, for all the lower doors were&#xD;
closed, and excepting the woman at the third&#xD;
story window, no sign of life bad yet come&#xD;
from the house. The flames were already&#xD;
shooting out of the windows of the second&#xD;
story and lt~pping the lower part of the house&#xD;
in a great sheet of fire.&#xD;
"The devil himself couldn't stand that&#xD;
heat," said one of the men as he attempted to&#xD;
rabe the ladder against the burning house.&#xD;
"For God's sake hurry," cried the woman,&#xD;
appearing again, and now with a child in her&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
"Up with the ladder, up with it, hurrah&#xD;
now," cried Sam.&#xD;
"Then there came a wild shriek of horror,&#xD;
pain and agony and the woman disappeared,&#xD;

&#xD;
MARDI&#xD;
&#xD;
and in a 'moment more the flames were seen&#xD;
shooting wildly up against the ceiling and&#xD;
around the wood-work of the room she had oc-&#xD;
cupied.&#xD;
Those who ha4 composed the little party in&#xD;
Cecelia's room, had retired to bed more than&#xD;
an hour before and slept heartily after the in-&#xD;
dulgencies of the night. Jake was first to hear&#xD;
the poise and hardly knew for some moments,&#xD;
what to make of it. When fully aroused he&#xD;
sprang from bed and in doing so aroused Bet-&#xD;
sy.&#xD;
"Where are you going, Jake I" she asked.&#xD;
"i'm going to get out of this," he answered&#xD;
in a hasty, angry tone, "don't you hear, you&#xD;
sleepy-head, the house is on fire I"&#xD;
"On fire, oh! my God I" exclaimed the wo-&#xD;
man, springing up,- "what 'will we do, what&#xD;
will we do?"&#xD;
"Do! got out of this," he said starting for&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
"Take me, Jake," she cried, catching hold of&#xD;
him, "take me along Jake."&#xD;
"Let me go," he said, trying to shake her off~&#xD;
"Oh! don't leave me, Jake!" she pI.eaded,~&#xD;
"what will I do-don't leave me, oh! for God's~&#xD;
sake, don't leave me."&#xD;
"Let me go, you fool," he cried1 pushing&#xD;
her rudely from him and hurrying down the&#xD;
hall. When he reached the stairs, he ran down&#xD;
them, in his hurry passing two or three steps&#xD;
at a time. When he reached the curve of the&#xD;
stairs his foot sljpped, and stumbling forward&#xD;
he came head foremost on to the floor, which,&#xD;
rotten by years of use and weakened by the&#xD;
flames that had been burning against it, now&#xD;
gave way beneath him, and as he uttered a&#xD;
foul imprecation on his soul, he was hurled&#xD;
below, striking a burning rafter here and a&#xD;
projecting plank there, until at last, senseless&#xD;
and almost lifeless, lie wa~s stretched out on&#xD;
the heap of burning timbers ou the ground&#xD;
floor. Betsy had followed him to the stairs,&#xD;
witnessed his fall ar~d as the flames shot an-&#xD;
grily up thi~ough the hole made by his passing&#xD;
body, she could go no further, but stood call-&#xD;
jug in a wild frenz~r, "Fire, fire, fire."&#xD;
Through all this not a movement had been&#xD;
heard on the upper story of the building. Ce-&#xD;
celia slept soundly, and dreamed of the scenes&#xD;
she had passed through during the summer.&#xD;
Then her mind wandered to the storied fields&#xD;
of the South, and visions of maugoes, bananas&#xD;
and tropical flowers, ladened with heavy per-&#xD;
&#xD;
GRAS;&#xD;
fumes, filled her dreams. At last there came a&#xD;
confused noise, she thought some onewas call-&#xD;
ing her, then there was the sound of many&#xD;
voices, and she started from her bed, half&#xD;
asleep, to hear Betsy's horrid cry of "Fire,&#xD;
fire."&#xD;
"Nelly, Sally, get up," she cried, pushing&#xD;
the sleeping girls with her feet whil6 she hnr-&#xD;
riedly put on some of her clothes. "Nelly,&#xD;
makeup! Nelly, Sally, don't you hear I"&#xD;
"What? what is it Ceely I" they both in-&#xD;
quired.&#xD;
~ she replied, "hurry up, the house&#xD;
is on fire! Listen! My God! we will all be&#xD;
burned up !"&#xD;
They all beard the cries iu the street, the&#xD;
dull, measured stroke of the engines as the&#xD;
men worked on them, and the crackling, hiss-&#xD;
ing noise of the flames as they raged and&#xD;
rolled nearer and nearer, while ever and anon,&#xD;
above all, came Betsy's cry of "fire, fire."&#xD;
Cecelia rushed out into the ball, where the&#xD;
smoke and heat were almost overpowering,&#xD;
and comprehending the position at a glance,&#xD;
called P1 Betsy, who was yet standing by the&#xD;
stair-way below.&#xD;
"Come here, Betsy, if you stand there&#xD;
streaming you will never escape. Come here,&#xD;
quick, up with you and we will see what we&#xD;
can do."&#xD;
She then ran to the end of the hall, threw&#xD;
open the front window and called to the men&#xD;
in the street below. The occupants of the&#xD;
other rooms on the flooi~, men, won~en and&#xD;
children, to the number of thirty or forty,&#xD;
were now coming out, crying, screaming,&#xD;
wringing their hands and running to and fro.&#xD;
The scene was terrible below them, the fire&#xD;
raged' fiercely, approaching nearer each mo-&#xD;
ment, the crisping and hissing of the flames&#xD;
was painfully distinct, the smoke swept&#xD;
through the hall in choking, blinding clouds&#xD;
and the heat grew more and more intense.&#xD;
There seemed no chance of escape but by the&#xD;
front windows, and to leap through them&#xD;
would be certain death on the stone paved&#xD;
street below.&#xD;
"Bring that long ladder here," cried Saw,&#xD;
as Cecelia appeared at the window above;&#xD;
"hurry up, let's make one more effort to save&#xD;
them."&#xD;
The ladder was brought and placed agaimt&#xD;
the burning house, but thc heat was so gredt&#xD;
that the men could scarcely stand by it. "Who&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
in h-can go up there ?" said one of the men&#xD;
'just look at that flame, it would roast a fel&#xD;
Icr 1,efore he could get up."&#xD;
"Stand aside," said Sam, preparing to as&#xD;
cend.; "it never shall be said they burned tc&#xD;
death without an attempt at rescue from us.'&#xD;
"But look, Sam," remonstrated the man,&#xD;
"who could go through that I"&#xD;
"XVho ever saw a true fireman afraid, wher&#xD;
hurnan4ife was to be saved," said Sam, firmly,&#xD;
"I say, George," he continued, addressing a&#xD;
man with one of the pipes, 'just turn youi&#xD;
stream on me and keep it there all the wa~&#xD;
The man obeyed and Sam began to mcend&#xD;
Soon two other streams are turned on him and&#xD;
his ladder, and l~is progress was watched with&#xD;
breathless interest by all of the immense&#xD;
crowd assembled. On he went, now he comes&#xD;
to where the heat is fiercest, and hesitates for&#xD;
one brief moment only; but what a thrill went&#xD;
through the crowd, and on he goes-now he&#xD;
nears the window and-he is inside. A sad-&#xD;
den thought seized the fire bound victims and&#xD;
with one accord they rushed for the window&#xD;
to throw themselves out upon the ladder. In&#xD;
vain did Sam talk to them, calling on them to&#xD;
wait, to go with care or help each other to es-&#xD;
cape. Seine in their hurry missed their foot-&#xD;
ing and fell, children were pushed entirely out,&#xD;
and thus hurled to the street below. A few&#xD;
clinging to the ladder were bruised and tramp-&#xD;
lad on by others above them, or burned by the&#xD;
flames that darted up and flashed around them.&#xD;
'J~he firemen kept their streams steadily on the&#xD;
ladder and thus kept a few from perishing.&#xD;
Atla~t the ladder was clear once more and his&#xD;
companions called loudly for Sam to come&#xD;
down.&#xD;
Cecelia had retired when the rush began, and&#xD;
now that it was over, she approached the win-&#xD;
dow and looked out from the giddy height.&#xD;
Through all this time she had been terribly&#xD;
quiet, so quiet that it seemed as if reason had&#xD;
left her; and as she looked out ol' the window&#xD;
her courage failed and she turned away again.&#xD;
"Come, I'll help you," said Sam, "let me step&#xD;

The sun rose clear and bright gilding the&#xD;
church spires and house tops with a flood of&#xD;
light, cheering wherever it penetrated, and dis-&#xD;
pelling all thoughts of the storm that had&#xD;
seemed so imn~inent the night before. it was&#xD;
a calm winter's morning, and, although the&#xD;
trees were leafless, and the grass was withered&#xD;
and brown, the warm rays of the sun made a&#xD;
pleasant mellow light, making it seem like a&#xD;
day in that loveliest of seasons, Indian sum-&#xD;
mer. The busy hum of the returning current&#xD;
of merchants, clerks, needle women and labor-&#xD;
ers, as they came from their homes across the&#xD;
two rivers, or from the upper part of the is-&#xD;
land, soon grew strong, and the preparations&#xD;
for the day's business werenoticeable on every-&#xD;
where. The boys at' Barege, Muslin &amp;amp; Cu's.,&#xD;
were sweeping out and dusting, the porters&#xD;
made great piles of calicos and domestics&#xD;
and hung out attractive shawls at the doors,&#xD;
the clerks who cam&amp;amp; early were arranging and&#xD;
asserting up their stocks and everybody ~1'out&#xD;
the store was busy.&#xD;
"We'll have a fine day after all," said Mr.&#xD;
Droll, who was marking a lot of handker-&#xD;
chiefs that had just come in.&#xD;
"Yea, we are likely to do a good trade," re&#xD;
plied Sam, with a look at the agreeable warmth&#xD;
outside, "and the more the merrier," for I just&#xD;
want a roaring trgde to keep me alive to-day."&#xD;
"You're 'owly,' to-day, hey 1" said Peter,&#xD;
"were you at a fire or frolic last night ?"&#xD;
"A little of both, especially the fire busi-&#xD;
ness," replied Sam. "Eh I gad, you ought to&#xD;
have been there, you never would have wished&#xD;
to see another fire."&#xD;
"What was it, Sam."&#xD;
"A tenement house, chock full of people,&#xD;
not more than a dozen of whom were saved,"&#xD;
replied Sam. "Such a sight! My God! to hear&#xD;

At this moment Philip came in, and being&#xD;
late, was met at the door by Mr. Crape, who&#xD;
angrily inquired where he had been; but&#xD;
Philip seeing Mr. Muslin near the lace took,&#xD;
stepped over to him and made his explain tion.&#xD;
"I was up nearly all night," he said," ith a&#xD;

and died this morning.~~&#xD;
"Indeed, Ptsilip," replied Mr. Muslin, 'I am&#xD;
sorry to hear it. Any of your uncle's fa ily?"&#xD;
"No, sir," said Philip, "an old lady who&#xD;
lived neat us, and as they have no one ~o a's-&#xD;

"Very well, Philip," replied Mr. Muslin.&#xD;

came forward.&#xD;
"She is dead," replied Philip.&#xD;
"Poor old lady, ~ am very sorry," said Mr.&#xD;
Droll. "Hew is Mary I"&#xD;
"She is very quiet, but seems to feel l~er loss&#xD;
very much."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, poor girl," replied Peter, "it's a&#xD;
terrible loss to her."&#xD;
"I am going to see about the funeral," said&#xD;
Philip, "and I'll sit up there to-night."&#xD;
"I'll come over," replied Peter; "'~ will be&#xD;

Mrs. Collinshad been failingvery rapidly,&#xD;
and the physician who had been waiting on&#xD;
her, had long known that he could do nothing&#xD;
more than give her temporary relief from&#xD;
pain, and make her death more tranquil and&#xD;
easy. When Philip called the previous even-&#xD;

since the morning. He insisted upon remain-&#xD;

Mary in the trying time that he knew was now&#xD;
close at hand. Mrs. Collins looked up, when&#xD;
he spoke, and recognized hium with a smile&#xD;
and a kind salutation, after which all were&#xD;
quiet again. She was quite free from pain and&#xD;
breathed softly and freely, except a slight rat-&#xD;
tle now and then, which seemed to annoy her&#xD;
more by its strangeness, than by any pain it&#xD;
gave. About midnight the death look became&#xD;

was her mother before her."&#xD;
"You knew her at home I,' inqulued Peter.&#xD;
"I didn't know herself much," replied Cathe-&#xD;
rine, "she was older tl~n me. I remember well&#xD;
when she was married to Mr. Collins, and a&#xD;
few days after left to come to lihis country. I&#xD;
was quite young then, but I never shall f6rgea&#xD;
how handsome she looked and how beautiful.&#xD;
Miss Sarah Murrey was as the bridesmaid. it&#xD;
was the handsomest sight lever saw."&#xD;
"I have talked with her often about the old&#xD;
country," said Peter.&#xD;
"Her folks had a nice farm, and everything&#xD;
comfortable," replied Catherine, "and *were&#xD;
well connected, the mother was a born lady. I&#xD;
knew the younger children, and lived once&#xD;
for a short time with the family."&#xD;
"She came to this country while she was&#xD;
young, I have often heard her say."&#xD;
"Yes, her husband was mixed up in poli-&#xD;
ties and was crazy to come to a free country,"&#xD;
replied the girl.&#xD;
"Thousands have left their home~" replied&#xD;
Peter, "for no other reason. The persecutions&#xD;
that have cursed that country have been a&#xD;
great benefit to this, by sending out many a&#xD;
good and brave man to seek a home here."&#xD;
"Oh! that's true," said the girl. "Now there&#xD;
was the young Squire, he was suspected of&#xD;
having something to do ~'ith trying to get up&#xD;
a revolution and was compelled to sell out and&#xD;
leave. Ab! that was a flue estate, a whole&#xD;
country side which had belonged to his family&#xD;
for generation after generation. He was ~x fine&#xD;
looking young man and never a tenant was&#xD;
distressed by hini or his fathers."&#xD;
"It was a sad thing for an old family to be&#xD;
broken up so."&#xD;
"So it was, sir, and one of the best in the&#xD;
country,~~ replied Catherine. "Before the&#xD;
union, as they call it, they belonged to the no-&#xD;
bility of the land, and for their opposition to&#xD;
English rule and' the abuses heaped upon our&#xD;
country, their titles were taken away and their&#xD;
estates cut down, and after all the young&#xD;
Squire was compelled to leave. I don't re-&#xD;
member the charges brought against him, but&#xD;
I have often heard the people talk about him&#xD;
and Sarah Murrey. She was semptress for the&#xD;
family, a very handsome and intelligent girl,&#xD;
and the folks used to say she was in love with&#xD;
the young Squire, but of course their positions&#xD;

"Did they get married I" asked Mr. Droll.&#xD;
"Oh! no. He lives way down south some-&#xD;
where, and she lived here. It is only a short&#xD;
time since I was speaking to Mrs. Collins&#xD;
about her~ she and Sarah were always good&#xD;
friends. Sarah died very suddenly, while&#xD;
spending some time in Troy. I don't think she&#xD;
ever saw the Squire after she came out here.&#xD;
If she did no one ever knew it."&#xD;
"Very sad, such breaking up of families,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Boddice, who had sat quietly listen-&#xD;
ing to this conversation.&#xD;
"it's awful," replied Catherine, "but friends&#xD;
are friends in life and death, and Mrs. Collins&#xD;
told me that she knew Sarah was dead before&#xD;
~he heard of it through the papers, because&#xD;
she saw the banshee."&#xD;
"You don't believe in the banshee, do you I"&#xD;
asked Philip, who now joined the circle.&#xD;
"Not believe in the banshee I" exclaimed&#xD;
Catherine, "there's nothing truer than the&#xD;
banshee. Sure my own cousin saw her. You&#xD;
see, cousin John was much in love with my&#xD;
sister Mary, a lovely ~jrl, the darlin' of the&#xD;
family. I~ was no wonder that John loved&#xD;
her, for everybody done that, and so he wasn't&#xD;
to blame. But you.know the holy Church for-&#xD;
hiSs such marriages, and me mother wouldn't&#xD;
ha' listened to it at all. Mary loved John, and&#xD;
in truth he was as fine a young man as ever&#xD;
struck a blow for the ouldeountry or emigrated&#xD;
to free America to 050'pO ol)pression and&#xD;
wrong. One morui~g John he comes up to&#xD;
Mary, as she was standing at ~he front door,&#xD;
God love her, and he says, 'Mary, darlin', I'm&#xD;
gem' across io the good country, and won't&#xD;
you come along I' 'John, I can't, because&#xD;
mother would never forgive it.' 'Sure, Mary,'&#xD;
he says, 'an' after the knot's tied and all over,&#xD;
your mother will say God bless you.' 'Now,&#xD;
John, dear,' says she, an' heaven rest the dar-&#xD;
tin', 'John,~ says she, 'you know the Father&#xD;
would not marry us.' 'The oi~ild man will do&#xD;
it,' says John, 'an', if tie don't, the Squire&#xD;
will.' 'John, John,' says Mary, her eyes&#xD;
standia' out wid horror, 'I didn't think, John,&#xD;
you'd speak so disrespectful of our Holy&#xD;
Mother, the Church.' 'Is it I,' says John,&#xD;
'would say anything against the Church? not&#xD;
I, my darling, but sure if we played a little trick&#xD;
on them, and got the Squire to do the job&#xD;
first, they would add their 'blessings after.&#xD;
&#xD;
wards.' 'No, no, John,' she says, 'I never can&#xD;
do anything behind backs, like, an' you better&#xD;
try an' find some one more deserving of yonr&#xD;
love, John,' and so, after a long talk, they sep-&#xD;
erated, both of them feeling very sad indeed.&#xD;
John he came to America, and from that very&#xD;
day Mary kept failing in health, just pining&#xD;
away like. Now, one morning, it was a Sun-&#xD;
day morning, and John was latin' abed later&#xD;
than usual, mind, he were here in New York,&#xD;
and w~ were in the ould country. In his room&#xD;
there wus a pair o' stairs, which led up into&#xD;
the room over head. lie' looked up, as he lay&#xD;
there in bad, and who should he see but me&#xD;
sister Mary, i~ comm' down the stairs. He was&#xD;
surprised and sat 'up in bed, and she, looking&#xD;
him right in the face, kept on dowil stairs,&#xD;
came round the foot of the bed, up to the side&#xD;
of it, and stood there, looking steadily at him.&#xD;
Her fuce was very pale, but natural, and her&#xD;
big brown eyes seemed filled with compassion&#xD;
andlove for him. That way shestoodformore'n&#xD;
a minit,'and then-she was gone, how or where&#xD;
hecould not tell. At thatvery moment, inthese&#xD;
arms of uLine, me sister Mary, Our Holy Mother&#xD;
pray for her, took her departure for a better&#xD;
and happier world."&#xD;
This story, told in a low, full tone of~voice,&#xD;
and with an earnestness that left no cixunce to&#xD;
doubt tl]e speaker's sincerity, told, too, in the&#xD;
presence of death itself, made quite an impres-&#xD;

"The old country is full of legends of inter.&#xD;

my own country it is the same.. There's not a&#xD;

against, pushed and jostled around so that he&#xD;
could hardly attend to his duties or say&#xD;
his devotions. Finally he went to his confes-&#xD;
sor, and asked his advice, giving him a history&#xD;
of all that had happened, and the good Father&#xD;
advised Joe to speak and ask what was wanted.&#xD;
He had no sooner returned to the church than&#xD;
the same demonstrations were commenced,&#xD;
and, making the sign of the cross, he demand-&#xD;
ed, in God's name, what was wanted, when,&#xD;
right there before him Mr. ~. appeared, just as&#xD;
he had often seen him in life. 'What do you&#xD;
want?' asked Joe, again blessing himself. 'I&#xD;
want you to make a restitution for me,' said&#xD;
Mr. B. or what had been him when he was&#xD;
alive, 'and I can never rest uxitil it is done.'&#xD;
'Very well, what shall I do I' asked Joe. 'Go&#xD;
to my house, and in the box where I kept my&#xD;
private papers you will find a watch, a fine&#xD;
gold watch which I never used, because I came&#xD;
by it unjustly. Tell my wife to give it to you,&#xD;
and take it to Mr. Th, to whom it belongs.' Joe&#xD;
not only promised to do this, but also to pray&#xD;
for the poor sinner. He went to the house and&#xD;
told Mrs. B. what bad happened, and they to-&#xD;
gether looked for the watch and fuund it. It&#xD;
was avery valuable article, and Mrs. B. refused&#xD;
to give it up, saying that Joe had been dream-&#xD;
ing and she did not believe Mr. B. had come by&#xD;
the watch dishonestly. While she was talking&#xD;
her husband appeared in the room and directed&#xD;
her to give the watch to Joe. She did so, of&#xD;
course, atid toe, took it to Mr. D., who at&#xD;

&#xD;
addressing Betsy, "and give me what infor-&#xD;
mation you can about Cecelia and I will re-&#xD;
ward you liberally."&#xD;
This arrangement was agreed to, and the&#xD;
three proceeded to Mr. MacVain's apartments.&#xD;
Here Betsy gave a history of~Ceeelia's move-&#xD;
meats from the first of her acquaintance with&#xD;
her, and finished by giving it as her opinion&#xD;
that Cecelia would go to Boston again unless&#xD;
she found a good place in the city. She wil-&#xD;
lingly volunteered to assist in hunting her up,&#xD;
and the next four or five days were~ spent in&#xD;
visiting such places as Betsy thought Cecelia&#xD;
would go to * In none of these could they hear&#xD;
anything of her; she had not been around and&#xD;
no one had seen her. Mr. MacVain supplied&#xD;
Betsy with new clothes and money to pay her&#xD;
expenses, and advised Williams to employ her&#xD;
during the next few mouths to help him look&#xD;
up the missing girl.&#xD;
"I must go home," he said, speaking to that&#xD;
gentleman, "my business demands my. pres-&#xD;
ence in New Orleans, and I will again leave&#xD;
the whole matter in your hands."&#xD;
Williams hesitated some minutes before re-&#xD;
plying, as he had determined to try to g.ive up&#xD;
the situation, if possible, and was now studying&#xD;
how he should b4ng it about.&#xD;
"Really, Mr. MacVain, I fear that, when we&#xD;
find this girl," he said, "it will only be another&#xD;
disappointment."&#xD;
"Why do you think so?" asked Mr4 MacVain,&#xD;
whQ had not allowed himself to doubt the&#xD;
[dantity of the girl.&#xD;
"Well, I can not see the reason for suppos-&#xD;
ng that she is the child you are looking for,"&#xD;
~eplicd Williams.&#xD;
"Why, her name, age, and desolate condi-&#xD;
~ion, without friends or family," said Mr. Mac-&#xD;
Vain, "all this is in favor of the supposition."&#xD;
"The name I dbn't think much proof, it is&#xD;
iot a very uncommon one," replied Williams,&#xD;
and, as to the other circumstances, we have&#xD;
allowed up a sedre of more promising cases&#xD;
~nly to be disappointed at last."&#xD;
"Well, sir, while you are looking her up, if&#xD;
~ou see any one else that you think is the&#xD;
hild we are in search of, yen can pay atten-&#xD;
ion to them," replied Mr. MacVain. "As to&#xD;

"It's not that, Richard, it's not that," the&#xD;
old gentleman would continue, "but really you&#xD;

Amongst the passengers assembled on the&#xD;

"Glad to meet you, Colonel," replied Mr&#xD;
Cheerful.&#xD;
When Dick rejoined Mr. MacVain, that gen-&#xD;
tieman asked:&#xD;
"Who wa~ that you spoke to there, Dick?"&#xD;
"He says he is a New Orleans man," was the&#xD;
reply. "Spades, Colonel Spad4 is his name."&#xD;
"Ahi yes, certainly," said 4r. MacVain, "I&#xD;
remember him now, I saw him at Niagara,"&#xD;
then sinking his voice he said, "his business&#xD;

"Just so!" replied Dick~ "you can easily tell&#xD;

Captain Brown was a man of great experi-&#xD;
ence and one of the most cautions men on the&#xD;
river. The water happened to be very low&#xD;
between St. Lonis and Cairo, and the. Captain&#xD;
kept the lead going nearly all the time. Fre-&#xD;
quently he would stop altogether, and send a&#xD;
yawl in advance to look for the channel and&#xD;
place buoys for the pilot to steer by. The first&#xD;
night being rather dark and cloudy, the boat&#xD;
was laid up until morning. Some of the pas-&#xD;
sengers thought this was acting too cautious,&#xD;
but they were satisfied of the' wisdom of the&#xD;
:neasui'e when on the way to Cairo they pass-&#xD;
ed some six or eight boats hard and fast&#xD;
aground that hdd left St. Louis two or three&#xD;
days before the Western Wave. After passing&#xD;
Cairo the boat began to show her qualities, a&#xD;
good weight of steam was pat on and away&#xD;
she went, passing every other vesse that&#xD;
came in sight. One day as Mr. MacVa n sat&#xD;
reading in the cabin, Dick came in fro the&#xD;
guards. There had been another grand heer-&#xD;
ing, fuss and commotion, by which Mr. Mac-&#xD;
Vain knew that they had caught up t and&#xD;
passed another boat, probably the six h or&#xD;
seventh that they served in the same wa&#xD;
"What boat was that, Dick ?" asked Mac-&#xD;
Vain, looking up.&#xD;
"Oh! a Cincinnati tub," replied Dick "the&#xD;
Indian Queen."&#xD;
"Something of a name," said MacVain.&#xD;
"Yes it is," replied Dick; "from the way she&#xD;
is running I guess she will get down to Or-&#xD;
leans about a week after we do."&#xD;
There were two men on board, who were&#xD;
going to Texas to buy cattle. They were&#xD;
farmers from Illinois, large and powerful men,&#xD;
dressed in homespun. They had already made&#xD;
&#xD;
several successful trips and were now return.&#xD;
lug with sufficient funds to buy a large drove&#xD;
of cattle. Mr. Elder, th9 youngest of the two,&#xD;
had seen much border service and had served&#xD;
through the Mexican war; and the other, Mr.&#xD;
Allensworth, was well suited in limb and&#xD;
nerve to be his companion, in a business that&#xD;
involved much danger, and many fatigues and&#xD;
privations.&#xD;
The boat was no sooner under way, than&#xD;
Colonel Spades began to look about for part.&#xD;
ners on the trip. Mr. MacVain, although ex-&#xD;
tremely polite and courteous, was too digni-&#xD;
fied and reserved to permit any show of famili-&#xD;
arity; and Dick avoided his advances with&#xD;
good nature excuses. The Colonel soon hit.&#xD;
upon the two drovers, and by ingenious man-&#xD;
ceuvering, before the first night was over, en-&#xD;
gaged them in ~ game of cards, in which they&#xD;
played against himself and the bar-keeper.&#xD;
But they played too cautiously, never loosing&#xD;
more than five or 'ten dollars at a sitting, and&#xD;
the Colonel was constant in his endeavors to&#xD;
get some of the passengers into the game in-&#xD;
stead of the bar-keeper, with whom it was&#xD;
evident he had a private understanding. rEhe&#xD;
boat wa~ nearing Bayou Sara, and the Captain&#xD;
said that they would be in New Orleans by&#xD;
ten o'clock next morning. A' game of straight&#xD;
poker was going on between the four, who'&#xD;
usually played in that set, and several of the&#xD;
passengers, Dick aild, Mr. MacVain, with the&#xD;
rest were standing by watching the playing.&#xD;
Later in the evening, the barkeeper was called&#xD;
away, and Colonel Spades, looking up at Dick&#xD;
said:&#xD;
- " Take a baud, Mr. Cheerful."&#xD;
"No, I thank you, Colonel, I'nuinot lucky in&#xD;
such speculations."&#xD;
"I guess you can play a 1)etter game than I&#xD;
can," said the Colonel.&#xD;
"I'm too near ~ said Dick, laughing,&#xD;
"to commence a spree, a man within twelve&#xD;
hours of home, ought to be sobering off."&#xD;
"You'll do," said Mr. Elder, "come, take the&#xD;
hand, and I'll see you through."&#xD;
"That's a bargain," said Dick, taking a seat&#xD;
at the table; "you must draw it mild, Colonel,&#xD;
remember I am a green horn."&#xD;
Colonel Spades was not pleased with the&#xD;
ironical tone in which this was said, but with-&#xD;
out answering, dealt the cards, and the game&#xD;
proceeded. Dick played with less caution&#xD;
than tho two drovers had been doing, and&#xD;
&#xD;
once or twice was caught for a nice little sum.&#xD;
He watched the game closely, and while he&#xD;
took his losses with the best of good humor,&#xD;
no movement of the plays escaped his no-&#xD;
tice. This was done in a careless manner that&#xD;
led the others of the party, as well as the look-&#xD;
ers on, to believe that he was playing without&#xD;
calenlation or management. It came to the&#xD;
Colonel's deal, and emboldened by Dick's man-&#xD;
ner, he put up a blind of twenty-five dollars,&#xD;
at which the two drovers protested, and then&#xD;
threw up their hands. The hand dealt to&#xD;
Dick was a good one, and he continued play-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
I'll see yo.u, Colonel, and go an X better,"&#xD;
he said carelessly counting out the money.&#xD;
"There's your ten, and twenty better," said&#xD;
theColonel.&#xD;
"And twenty better" said. Dick, perfectly&#xD;
cool.&#xD;
ri~liC Colonel very adroitly slipped a card oat&#xD;
of his sleeve into his hand, and then watching&#xD;
an opportunity, discarded one from those he&#xD;
had previously held. This moi~ement was not&#xD;
lost by Dick, bat he said nothing, and looked so&#xD;
calm and indifferent, that Mr. MacVain, who&#xD;
had also seen the trick, felt uneasy, and in a&#xD;
~iuiet way, did his best to attract the"atteution&#xD;
of Dick.&#xD;
'1 see your twenty, and go you fifty better,"&#xD;
said the Colonel. As he placed the money on&#xD;
the table, and changed another card, and this&#xD;
time he was observed not only by Dick and&#xD;
MacVain, bat also by Elder, who at once deter-&#xD;
mined to expose him. The Colonel had now&#xD;
got his hand fixed to suit him, and inwardly&#xD;
chuckling at his adroitness, he launched bold-&#xD;
lyont.&#xD;
"I'll see you, Colonel," said Dick, drawing&#xD;
out a roll of money, "and go you fifty better', 1&#xD;
"Well, I declare," said the Colonel, elated at&#xD;
his success, "I'll go you a hundred better."&#xD;
"And I sweep the boards," said Dick, suit-&#xD;
ing the action to the words by drawing all the I&#xD;
mopey over to his side of th~ table.&#xD;
"What do you mean, sir ?" cried the Colonel,&#xD;
springing up.&#xD;
"When I play With an honest man," said&#xD;
Dick, firmly, "if I lose, its all right, but&#xD;
when I play with a scoundrel, I take all the&#xD;
chances, and I never allow myself to be cheat-&#xD;
ed, if I know it."&#xD;
"I'll h~ve satisfaction, sir," cried the polo- I~&#xD;
'ad, placing his hand under his coat, as if s'&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
feeling for a weapon; "give up the money at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
"When this little dog stops barking," re-&#xD;
plied Dick, placing a pistol 'before him on the&#xD;
table, "maybe P11 give up the money."&#xD;
"Bravo, for you," said Elder, striking the&#xD;
'table with his fist, "that ar's well said, fur I&#xD;
see him change the cards with my own eyes."&#xD;
"Oh, if every one is against me," said the&#xD;
Colonel, looking around, "of course I can do&#xD;
nothing-but I'll see you again when I can&#xD;
have fair play."&#xD;
'If you had knowumeasweflas you pre-&#xD;
tended to," replied Dick, "you ~would never&#xD;
have tried such a lame game on me-I've run&#xD;
this river too long to be imposed on by such&#xD;
child's play."&#xD;
"I'll report you all over Orleans," said the&#xD;
enraged Colonel, "as a cheat and braggart."&#xD;
"Look yon, Colonel Spades," said Dick,&#xD;
facing the gambler with a fierce, determined&#xD;
look, "I know you well, and nothing you can&#xD;
report of me will affect me in the least. All&#xD;
I've got to say is that yew must be careful&#xD;
what you talk about, for I'd just as soon give&#xD;
you a dose of lead for breakfast as not. Be&#xD;
careful who you trifle with, and never try to&#xD;
gull an old Miss~issippi steamboat.man, nor&#xD;
to bully him into silence when he catches you&#xD;
trying to steal."&#xD;
Colonel Spades' courage melted before Dick's&#xD;
flashing eyes and menacing look, and he slunk&#xD;
away to his stateroom, like a whipped cur.&#xD;
It was abQut ten o'clock next day when the&#xD;
boat reached the Stock-Landing, where Dick&#xD;
~ot off, and took acab forhis own house, where&#xD;
Lie was anxious to be once more. Mr. Mac-&#xD;
Vain and the other passengers remained on&#xD;
board until th~ boat landed them at the levee&#xD;
below, where they were all much pleased to&#xD;
Arrive.&#xD;
Since he had left his home, Mr. MacVain had&#xD;
jeen constantly iii search of the miming child,&#xD;
fruitless search, full of disappointment, aux-&#xD;
ety, and gloomy, prospects, and he felt a com-&#xD;
)arative relief when he ox~ce more sutered&#xD;

scarcely knew what to do. Hecr clothes, ex-&#xD;
cept the scanty covering that she had thrown&#xD;
on when awakened from her sleep, were lost in&#xD;
the fire, but fortunately her small eapital in&#xD;
cash was contained in thepocket of the dress she&#xD;
had saved. Not knowing where she was going,&#xD;
except that she-was leaving behind the scenes'&#xD;
which the experience of the last few hours had&#xD;
made terrible, she started across the city, and&#xD;
entering the ferry-boat, was landed in Jersey&#xD;
City just as the sun began to illuminate theroll-&#xD;
ing waters of the river she was crossing. Pass-&#xD;
ing along the street, she attracted the attention&#xD;
of a woman who was cleaning out the saloon&#xD;
of a small public house. The woman looked&#xD;
at her with much interest and seemed to be&#xD;
kindly disposed, so that Cecelia, stopping,&#xD;
asked her for a drink of water.&#xD;
" Where do you come from I" the woman in-&#xD;
quired as she handed her the drink. -&#xD;
" I came from New York, but just now," an-&#xD;
swered. Cecelia, humbly. "I came near ettng&#xD;
burned up last night."&#xD;
" Dear me! you don't say so!1" exclaimed the&#xD;
woman, "was there a fire over there last&#xD;
night I" .&#xD;
" An awful fire, mcem," said Cecelia, "and&#xD;
ever so many people burned to death."&#xD;
"Oh! how terrible! And were 'you in it 7"&#xD;
" I was in the fifth story of the building,&#xD;
mnem," said Cecelia, in a weak voice, "and&#xD;
was saved by the firemen."&#xD;
" They are a noble set of men, a flue lot of&#xD;
men," replied the woman. "Was it a tenement&#xD;
house 7"-&#xD;
" It was, mew," replied Cecelia, and I lost.&#xD;
everything I had, but just the clothes I have&#xD;
on my -back." .&#xD;
" And they don't seem to be enough to keep&#xD;
you warm."&#xD;
"No, mew, they dqn't," said Cecelia-.&#xD;
"Perhaps I have g t an old dress I can give&#xD;
you," replied the woman; and so she went into&#xD;
thehonse and soon returned with a dress, not&#xD;
much worn, which she rolled up and gave to&#xD;
the girl. 'Returning thanks= for her kindness,&#xD;
Cecelia went on her way. She had now con-&#xD;
ceived a new idea-a plan for replacing her&#xD;
lost clothes, and spent th~ balance of the day&#xD;
in begging from house to louse for old clothes-.&#xD;
At each place she rehearse d the incidents of&#xD;
the fire, with a cunning of position and a&#xD;
pathos of expression, that would have been&#xD;
creditable to her as an actress on the stage,.&#xD;

eat on her journey., As she was returning to&#xD;
the depot, the clerks in a small dry goods store&#xD;
were trimming the doors.. She stoppedto look&#xD;
in the window, and the young men, having&#xD;
made a pile of blankets, finished it off with&#xD;
three or four shawls. One of these, a dark&#xD;
ground, with a bright red border and heavy&#xD;
fringe, the girl admired very much. It was a&#xD;
warm shawl, of fine quality, and shethought it&#xD;
would be very comfortable while traveling.&#xD;
Watching an opportunity, when the two clerks,&#xD;
who were laughing and talking over some party&#xD;
or entertainment which they had attended the&#xD;
night before, were off their guard, she loosened&#xD;
thie shawl from the rest, and, placing it under&#xD;
her arm, she hastened 'hack to the depot, and&#xD;
once more took her seat in the train. .&#xD;
The cars were rapidly filling up ; porters&#xD;
were~ running around in the mad endeavor to&#xD;
&#xD;
"I hope I shall, sir. I don't want to stay&#xD;
here, sir, because I have no friends here. My&#xD;
aunt, that I lived with, died two months ago,&#xD;
and I have had no home since, and I must get&#xD;
out to my mother." g&#xD;
"You are a very small child to start on such&#xD;
a journey alone," said the conductor, after a&#xD;
steady look at her, during which time he&#xD;
seemed to be considering' 'ihat to do. "I sup-&#xD;
posie you can't help being small, however, an~d&#xD;
I admire your pluck, so you can go as far as&#xD;
Philadelphia, I don't go any further."&#xD;
At Philadelphia she went directly to the cars&#xD;
for Baltimore. Before the train started the&#xD;
conductor came round, and seeing her, a rough-&#xD;
looking, poorly clad child, asked where she&#xD;
ras going and if she had a ticket. To him shie&#xD;

ductor accused her of trying to run away from&#xD;

that prayers and entreaties were alike unavail-&#xD;
ing, Cecelia left the depot, and sought a cheap.&#xD;
place to stay all night. Here she remained&#xD;
several days, and had almost determined to&#xD;
give up the effort to get South, when she met&#xD;
the conductor of the'Jersey road and told him&#xD;
what had occurred. The kind-hiearted man&#xD;
drew out of his pocket a time table card of his&#xD;
road, and wrote on the back of it:&#xD;
" The bearer of this; Cecelia Benson, being&#xD;
without friends in this part of the country,&#xD;
with the pluck and' perseverance of a true&#xD;
American, has started on a journey to find her&#xD;
relatives in New Orleans. -As she'has no&#xD;
money, the gentlemen connected with the rail-&#xD;
roads and other public conveyances on the&#xD;
route, are requested to pass her free, and give&#xD;
her such advice and assistance' as may be&#xD;
within their power, consistent, with their&#xD;
duties.      WILLIAM JONES, Conductor."&#xD;
" There. sis, that will pass you plump into&#xD;
the Crescent City," he said, " or I much, mis-&#xD;
take the good feeling of our craft."&#xD;
" Oh! thank you, sir," replied Cecelia, "and&#xD;
I shall soon be with my mother again."&#xD;
"I hope yotu may," he said, patting her on&#xD;
the shoulder. "I sincerely wish you saecess.&#xD;
Good-bye, and when you get down there drop-&#xD;
me a line to let me know how you get along,"&#xD;
"I will do it, sir. Oh, thank you," she said,&#xD;
accepting the gold piece he held out to her.&#xD;
The conductor's pass acted like a charm un-&#xD;
til she reached the stage road, where she had1&#xD;
to take a stage to cross the Alleghany moun-&#xD;
tains. The coach was already filled with pas-&#xD;
;engers and the agent said that she must wait.&#xD;
4"How soon can I get on 1" she inquired.&#xD;
"I'm not the proprietor," replied the man,&#xD;
'if he was here he migh t send you on at once ;&#xD;

"Don't the stages run every day ?" she-&#xD;
sked.&#xD;
"Sometimes they do, sometimes every other&#xD;
Lay," he replied,. " but dead-beads must .wait&#xD;
until there's plenty of room when i'm around?'&#xD;
" Don't you sometimes ask favors of this&#xD;
oad?" she said, again showing the conductor's&#xD;
ass,&#xD;
"Well, suppose we do I" replied the man.&#xD;

head grumbler.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, that's my orders," "replied the&#xD;
driver, "and besides there's no telling how&#xD;
soon there may come a storm, and I don't want&#xD;
to be snowed in."&#xD;
Taking another look at the comfortable fire&#xD;
and a last warming of toes, the passengers re-&#xD;
sumed their seats in the stage. They were so&#xD;
r~.ucb fatigued with their long journey that&#xD;
neither the noise of the stage, or the roughness&#xD;
of the road kept them awake. The coach&#xD;
rolled forward, then righted up, pitched all on&#xD;
one side, nearly turning over, and the next&#xD;
turn would bring the other side over, and the&#xD;
passengers were thrown first one way and then&#xD;
another, pushed into a jumble in one corner&#xD;
and then back again. Through all this they&#xD;
slept, only waking up for a moment, when some&#xD;
extra great lurch was made by the vehicle.&#xD;
The muornin~ of the fifth day brought them to&#xD;
&#xD;
'the end of the stage route. Before separating,&#xD;
Cecelia's friend, to whom she had related the&#xD;
same story that she told to Conductor Jones'&#xD;
with such improvements as suggested them-&#xD;
selves to her mind, endorsed the conductor's&#xD;
pass, adding' a request that all who could as-&#xD;
sist her on ~he journey would do so. The name&#xD;
he signed t~ this was one of the most popular&#xD;
and belove ~l in the western country, and since&#xD;
has received the nation's honor and reverence,&#xD;
although 4se bearer of it has bee~a "gathered&#xD;
to his fathers."&#xD;
~At Pittsburg Cecelia applied to the captain&#xD;
of the Indian Queen, a small boat, which was&#xD;
advertised to leave for New Orleans immediate-&#xD;
ly. After reading her pass and the endorse-&#xD;
ment of it by her late fellow-traveler, the&#xD;
captain gave her permission to etime on board.&#xD;
It was so late in the season, he said, that he&#xD;
was fearful that his boat would get frozen&#xD;
in before they reached a warmer climate , and,&#xD;
as he had a good lbad on board, he left that&#xD;
evening. After 'a trip of eleven days, the good&#xD;
boat arrived safely, and, with twenty-five cents&#xD;
in her pocket, Cecelia landed to try her fortune&#xD;
in the Crescent City.&#xD;
ChAPTER XIV&#xD;
Mary returned to her home with a sad heart,&#xD;
for there was no one there to welcome her, and&#xD;
cheer her life with love and kindness. The&#xD;
many privations that she had borne, the ta ski&#xD;
of work that she, although tender in years~&#xD;
had performed; her perseverance in the en-&#xD;
deav~r to earn the little money that had been&#xD;
their main support, nud her denial of all&#xD;
pleasure and amusement to herself, she had&#xD;
felt a pleasure, because they added to the couP&#xD;
fort of her who had been in all things a kind&#xD;
and 1~ ving mother. But that support was now&#xD;
gone, or, although her mother had been feeble,&#xD;
and i~nable to do much, her presence corn-&#xD;
mand~ d respect for the house, her i ufluence&#xD;
was t~e tie that held them together as a fami.&#xD;
ly.  L~he house must now be closed, the furni-&#xD;
ture sold to pay the rent and funeral expenses&#xD;
and she 'must go out into the world to seek mm&#xD;
living amongst strangers. Mrs. Boddice, had&#xD;
remained behind, while the others followed&#xD;
the corpse to the city of the dead, and when&#xD;
Mary returned, all traces of the sad event had&#xD;
been removed. The furniture stood in its no&#xD;

are very kind, very indeed,"~aidMary,&#xD;
with a decision far beyond her yeart, "but I&#xD;
must darn my way through the. world."&#xD;
"That sounds strange in a little child like&#xD;
you," ho replied, "and I beg of yen to banish&#xD;
the idea at once."&#xD;
"Mother taught me much, Mr. Droll," she&#xD;
said, "and by reading I have learned a great&#xD;
deal, and I am much better advanced than you&#xD;
think."&#xD;
"So much the better," replied he, "you can&#xD;
board where I do-Mrs. Reed told me this&#xD;
evening that she had a room you could have,&#xD;
and there is a very nice school near by, where&#xD;
you can attend-you will be comfortabIC~and, I&#xD;
trust, happy."&#xD;
"But the expense would be heavy' she re-&#xD;
plied, "and I would netlike to tax your friend-&#xD;
ship so much."&#xD;
"Never think of that," he replied, "sure I&#xD;
have some little money laid up in the bank,&#xD;
and I am earning more than my expenses-&#xD;
what is the value of money if we Can not do&#xD;
good with it?"&#xD;
"Indeed, sir, I thank you," she said earn'~st-&#xD;
ly, "but I cannot accept your offer and allow&#xD;
you to spei4 your savings in that way."&#xD;
"I tell you, Mary, I do not need the money,&#xD;
and I am sure I could make no better use of&#xD;
it than in giving you a chance to get-an edu-&#xD;
cation, that will fit you for that struggle with&#xD;
the wor-id which will come soon enough. Say&#xD;
no more on the subject but consider it settled&#xD;
that you are to come over with me."&#xD;
"But Mr. Droll, just think-"&#xD;
"Nay, now, it is my wish," he said, " and in-&#xD;
stead of saying Mr. Droll, you may call me&#xD;
Uncle Peter-just think, for a moment, how&#xD;
comfortable you will ~&#xD;
"If I could hope to ever repay you,~~ she re-&#xD;
plied, "it would be different, but to be so great&#xD;
a tax on y~i, and never make any return for&#xD;
your kindness would be too much."&#xD;
As she stopped speaking, Philip Cummings&#xD;
came in, and greeting them kindly, took a seat&#xD;
near them. To him Mr. Droll now appealed&#xD;
for support of his proposition.&#xD;
"I want Mart to board at Mrs. Reed's afld&#xD;
go to school for a while," he said to Philip,&#xD;
"and I will pay the expense. I have no one&#xD;
but myself to te~ke care of now, and I would&#xD;
be glad to have her do it."&#xD;
&#xD;
"My dear, kind friend," skid Philip, enthu-&#xD;
siastically shaking Mr. Dro~ l's hand, "this is&#xD;
generous, indeed, and the best arrangement&#xD;
that could be made."&#xD;
There now !" exclaimed Mr. Droll, tri-&#xD;
umphantly, "didn't I know it? Now you see&#xD;
m~r plan is endorsed by Philip."&#xD;
The proposal suitc(t Mary ver~' well. Mr.&#xD;
Drqll had gained her confidence and esteem by&#xD;
his uniform kindness, and she was ambitious&#xD;
o( an opportunity to improve her mind, but&#xD;
her mother had impressed4 upon her the idea&#xD;
that it was mean and degrading to accept&#xD;
favors from strangers, it was like taking chari-&#xD;
ty, instead of working for what she wanted.&#xD;
"Your offer is very k~nd," she replied, "but&#xD;
mother always taught me it was more honor.&#xD;
able to get a living by labor, even though it&#xD;
was scanty and poor, than to depend upoi'&#xD;
stran gers.~~&#xD;
"But I am no stranger," urged Mr. Droll, "I&#xD;
was a friend of your mother's, and I am sure,&#xD;
if she was living, she would approve of your&#xD;
going under my care. I have no relative in&#xD;
this country, and am able to pay the little ex-&#xD;
pense that your schooling will be. I am only&#xD;
doing as I would wish some one else might do,&#xD;
if a sister of my own was left unprotected. As&#xD;
for your paying me, you can do that in being&#xD;
kind and good, and persevering in your studies,&#xD;
as fol' the money, the satisfaction of doing&#xD;
that which I believe is right will be a daily&#xD;
recompense. You must urge no more ex-&#xD;
cuses, come with me, go to school, and excel&#xD;
all your companions in your classes, and you&#xD;
will always find a good frk:~d in Uncle Peter."&#xD;
"I am sure our good friend is right," said&#xD;
Philip, '~ and I hope you will accept his offer."&#xD;
"It will lie a very great satisfaction to me,"&#xD;
continued Mr. Droll. "Your mother I esteemed&#xD;
very highly, she was a lady of fine feeling,&#xD;
sensible and good, and to take care of her only&#xD;
child, and assist 'her on the road of life, will&#xD;
be a constant pleasure."&#xD;
"I hope I appreciate your kindness," replied&#xD;
Mary, "and I understand the many advantages&#xD;
that I shall enjoy ur'4er your protection and&#xD;
care. It may be that some time in the future&#xD;
I will be able to reward you, at any rate I&#xD;
I will do the best I can to please you by atten.&#xD;
tion to my studies."&#xD;
"That is well said," replied Peter, his face&#xD;
beaming with pleasure, at his triumph, "1 am&#xD;
sure you will do admirably."&#xD;
&#xD;
4                                                                                                    V.&#xD;
&#xD;
53&#xD;
&#xD;
"So she will, I know," said Philip, equally&#xD;
pleased that the difficult problem was solved,&#xD;
"and it will be a step she will never regret."'&#xD;
They conversed long on the plans for the fu-&#xD;
ture, and were equally well pleased with each&#xD;
other. Mrs. Beddice sent her servant girl over&#xD;
to sleep in the house and keep i~tary company~&#xD;
a thoughtful attention that settled another&#xD;
difficult question for them.&#xD;
On the following day Mary removed to Mrs*&#xD;
Reed's, taking with her a small trunk of cloth-&#xD;
ing and a few articles that she did not wish to&#xD;
part with. The remainder of the contents of&#xD;
the old home was disposed of by Mr. Droll,&#xD;
who charged himself with the settlement of&#xD;
the whole business. Mary at once entered&#xD;
school, with instructions to the principal from&#xD;
Mr. Droll that she should enjoy every facility&#xD;
for improvement, as he was ~yillingto stand all&#xD;
reasonable expense in the mi~tter of hei educa-&#xD;
tion. At first Mary took up only the lessons&#xD;
common to an English school, but in a short&#xD;
time French, music and embroidery were added&#xD;
to these. In all of these, except French and&#xD;
needle-work, Mr. Droll was well versed, and&#xD;
spent his evenings in assisting her to perfect&#xD;
herself in the tusks assigned to her. Philip&#xD;
was a frequent visitor, and joined with interest&#xD;
in the conversations that their occupation&#xD;
brought up.&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
After returningher thanks to the Captain of&#xD;
the Indian Queen, Cecelia stayed out into the&#xD;
city to find some cheap place to live in. The&#xD;
little child dressed in odd fitting clothes, with&#xD;
the great shawl wrapped around herd and her&#xD;
bundle of clothes under her arm or on her&#xD;
shouldem~, attracted much attention a~ she&#xD;
trudged along the streets, looking curiously&#xD;
around at everything that was new or inter-&#xD;
esting to her Many people stopped to look back&#xD;
and wonder who the strange young creature&#xD;
was, and, once or twice, some kind hearted&#xD;
person, thinking that she probably belonged&#xD;
to semi' epsigrant train; and had lost her way,&#xD;
spoke to her, inquiring where she was going.&#xD;
Once a round faced, good nature looking gen.&#xD;
tleman, took the cigar from hi~ mouth as he&#xD;
was passing, and, smiling pleasantly, was&#xD;
about to say something to her, when another&#xD;
gentleman came up, and greeting him with&#xD;

&#xD;
friendly warmth, began with "'Pen my soul,&#xD;
Dick, I'm glad to see you back! When did you&#xD;
get home T flow have you been ~ and the two&#xD;
passed on, chatting pleasantly together. At&#xD;
last she found herself on Chartres street, then&#xD;
the street for dry goods, millinery and fancy&#xD;
articles. A few steps from Canal street she&#xD;
stopped to admire the goods displayed in the&#xD;
window of a- large dry goods store, and w~s&#xD;
wishing that she had plenty of money to buy&#xD;
some of the silks and other pretty articles,&#xD;
when she observed a lady coming down the&#xD;
store towards her. She was tall and queen-&#xD;
like in figure and carriage, her luxuriant hair,&#xD;
richly black and fine, was combed in bandeaux,&#xD;
her features were beautiful and regular, her&#xD;
eyes were black, full and sparkling, and. her&#xD;
faqe, a little pale, bore an expression of digni-&#xD;
ty and refinement, that commanded respect&#xD;
and admiration from all beholders. The clerk,&#xD;
who had politely followed her to the door,&#xD;
bowed as shepassed out and said&#xD;
"Good evening, Mrs. Macourty.~~&#xD;
Cecelia thought that she had never before&#xD;
seen, a lady so beautiful, and the pleased ex-&#xD;
pression of the child's face must have~been&#xD;
noticed by the lady, for she stopped a moment&#xD;
to look at the strange figure, and then went&#xD;
over to where the girl was standing. They&#xD;
stood there silent for some minutes, when Mrs.&#xD;
Maaourty asked her if she thought of making&#xD;
a purchase.&#xD;
"I wish I had the money," Cecelia replied,&#xD;
"to buy that green silk, its so pretty."&#xD;
"Yes it is," said Mrs. Macourty, looking at&#xD;
the queer costume and large bundle of the&#xD;
child's , "whore are yen going?"&#xD;
"I don't know, ma'am."&#xD;
"Where do you live I"&#xD;
"I don't live any where, now," replied Ce-&#xD;
celia, looking up into the sweet face that bent&#xD;
over her, "I just come here from New ~&#xD;
"From New York !" exclaimed Mrs. Macour-&#xD;
ty, "and all by yourself, or had you friends&#xD;
with you V"&#xD;
"No nia'am, I didn't have any one with mc."&#xD;
"Why did you come here, so far awy from&#xD;
your home I"&#xD;
"J have no home there neiV," said Cecelia,&#xD;
"my mother is here, and I come to look for&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"You come 1o look for your mother? Well I&#xD;
hope you may find her," as she said this she&#xD;
turned as if to go away, and then, after some&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
thought, she continued, ", where are you going&#xD;
to stay to-mnghti&#xD;
" I don't know ma'am, I haven't found any&#xD;
place yet." .&#xD;
Mrs. Macourty thought of the many evil&#xD;
ways that were open to such an unprotected&#xD;
child, of the rebuff and scorn she might meet&#xD;
in seeking a lodging place, and then said :&#xD;
" Come with me, child,' and I will give you&#xD;
shelter for to-night."&#xD;
The, girl accepted the invitation without&#xD;
hesitation, and they crossed Canal street&#xD;
again, to take an omnibus for up town. Noth-&#xD;
ing much was said luring the ride-Mrs. Ma-&#xD;
courty was thinking of the little ones at home,&#xD;
Annie, a bright eyed child of six; George, a&#xD;
bonncing boy of four, and Idlaggie a rosy&#xD;
checked cherub of two years of ago.- These&#xD;
had cone to comfort her, and fill her heart&#xD;
with love and her mind with anxious care,&#xD;
since the loss of her first child. But all their&#xD;
smiles and winning ways could not sever her&#xD;
thoughts from the darling, 'who had been so&#xD;
mysteriously snatched from the home-circle.&#xD;
Years had passed, years of doubt and hope, of&#xD;
anxious inquiry and earnest prayer, and the&#xD;
grief of that loss was as fresh and fervent as&#xD;
when it first occurred. Mr. Macourty felt the&#xD;
blow terribly, but he-was in the whirl of a&#xD;
successful business, and the reasoning of&#xD;
friends turned his mind to other subjects, or&#xD;
persuaded him, as he endeavored to convice&#xD;
his wife, that the child was, dead. But a&#xD;
mother's. love is deep and lasting ; no reason&#xD;
will sway it, no time blot it ot; even though&#xD;
repelled and scorned it turns again and again&#xD;
to-its idol. Mrs. Macourty would have been&#xD;
happier if she had known that her little one&#xD;
was dead ; then her heart would have turned&#xD;
to the little green mound, or the marble, tomb&#xD;
that hid from, her the object of her love, and&#xD;
her grief would have been relieved by the cer-&#xD;
tainty that before the Thirone of Grace one&#xD;
angel voice was pleading for her. No reason-&#xD;
ing could persuade her that the child was&#xD;
dead. For days and weeks the question was&#xD;
ever present to her, " What is 'she doirgg ?"&#xD;
Visions of the dear babe, growing up in want,&#xD;
ignorance, amidst crime and misery, without&#xD;
the knowledge that there was a God, or that&#xD;
sin brings degi'adation, would haunt her mind&#xD;
and hang over her life like a pall. And as she&#xD;
rode homeward with her little stranger, she&#xD;
&#xD;
Wondered if her Cecelia had fallen that low,&#xD;
nd for the sake of the absent child she re-&#xD;
solved to aid this young wanderer ia her&#xD;
search for her mother.&#xD;
At the gate they were met by the children,&#xD;
who were delighted to see their mother home&#xD;
again, and Annie shook hands very agreeably&#xD;
with the little stranger, and volunteered to&#xD;
show her all the toys and make her comfort-&#xD;
able. Maggie, with her sweet face full of mnerri-&#xD;
ment, came laughing and'shouting "Me appee,&#xD;
mamma, me appee." ,&#xD;
" Yes, darling, I brought you an apple,'"&#xD;
said Mrs. Macourty, catching her in her arms&#xD;
-and kissing her. She was so like her lost&#xD;
baby, in her looks and her childish ways, that&#xD;
her mother was constantly reminded by her&#xD;
of little Cecelia. .&#xD;
After laying asid her street dress, and ar-&#xD;
ranging her toilet, she returned to the sitting-&#xD;
room, where Cecella and the children were&#xD;
busy inspecting the playthings that Annie had&#xD;
brought out.&#xD;
" Who did you live with in New York?" Mrs-&#xD;
Macourty inquired.,,&#xD;
" I lived with a lady named Brown," replied&#xD;
Cecelia, "but I did not hear from my mother&#xD;
for more than a year, and so I came out here."&#xD;
" What is your name in Mrs. Macourty had&#xD;
been too busy with her own thougl~ts to ask&#xD;
the question before.&#xD;
" Cecelia,!" exclaifmed Mrs. Macourty, start-&#xD;
led by the coincidence of the name.&#xD;
" Yes, ma'am, Ceceha. Benson. My father&#xD;
died when I was very young, and my mother&#xD;
had to work very hard for our support."&#xD;
Mrs. Macourty was reasured by this appar-&#xD;
ently straight and circumstantial story, The&#xD;
excitement was all gone, and although she&#xD;
wondered at the strange accident that should&#xD;
bring to her home, one of the same name and&#xD;
about the same age as her own lost child, she&#xD;
did not doubt the story at all.  .    -&#xD;
in the evening Mr. Macourty returned, and&#xD;
was met with kisses and loving words by his&#xD;
wife and children. He had grown stouter&#xD;
than when we last saw him, wore a heavy&#xD;
heard, and looked more settled and manly,&#xD;
but the seven years had improved his looks,&#xD;
for he seemed younger than before. His wife&#xD;
told him the stranger's story, and dwelt much&#xD;
on the fact that her name and age- were the&#xD;
same as that of the child they had lost,"&#xD;
&#xD;
5A&#xD;

A TALE OF ANTE BDsLLUM TIMES.   ~     5&#xD;
&#xD;
" Youa don't think that is our child I" said&#xD;
he-.&#xD;
" Oh! no, George, not at all," replied 'Mrs,.&#xD;
.-Macourty, " she says her mother is living in&#xD;
this city. No I did not think that-but she is&#xD;
so poor and friendless, I-I thought-" here&#xD;
she pansel.&#xD;
" Well, my dear, what did you wish I"&#xD;
" I thought that we might let her stay here&#xD;
for ah'il ," she said, "until she can find her&#xD;
"ut as you like," he replied, and so the&#xD;
matter was settled.&#xD;
After supper the little ones were sent to bed,&#xD;
and Cecel'a Was placed in a small room iiext&#xD;
to their's, with a door connecting the two&#xD;
rooms, thr ugh which she watched the other&#xD;
children as they prepared for bed. Annie&#xD;
knelt before an altar ornamented with a small&#xD;
-statuette of the Blessed Mother and child, and,&#xD;
blessing herself, said her prayers, after which&#xD;
she taught Maggie to do the same. George&#xD;
was less reverential in his devotions, dropping&#xD;
on his knees before the altar, he made a very&#xD;
large sign of the cross, and rattled off his&#xD;
prayer as if he were racing against time. This&#xD;
was a new and novel sight to Cecelia, whose&#xD;
only pi-ayer was the Obr Father, which she&#xD;
knew but imperfectly, and had seldom used.&#xD;
Mrs. Macourty soon came upstairs, however-,&#xD;
and requested Cecelia to come and say .he'r&#xD;
prayers. Cecelia was good at imitation, and&#xD;
she now went forward, knelt before the altar&#xD;
and blessed herself as nicely as if she had been&#xD;
used to doing so all her life. She then recited&#xD;
the " Odr Father," the mistakes she made were&#xD;
kindly corrected by the lady. Next morning,&#xD;
as they were seated at the breakfast-table,&#xD;
Mr. Macourty asked Cecelia if the lady wa's&#xD;
kindi that she had lived with in,.New York.-&#xD;
" Oh ! no, sir," she replied, with a well-acted&#xD;
shudder, "she used to beat Sme, and treat me&#xD;
very bad."&#xD;
" .Poor child, how you must have suffered,"'&#xD;
said Mrs. Macourty, "what a terrible thing to&#xD;
think of leaving a child to strangers." e&#xD;
-" Yes, ma'am, she used to vent all her bnad-&#xD;
ness on me," replied Cecelia, looking mnourn-&#xD;
fully around, "ebut that was not the worst." "&#xD;
"What else was there ?" asked Mr. Macour- i&#xD;
ty, in a dotibtful tone, for the stranger had not&#xD;
made a very favorable impression on him.  s&#xD;
" They were Protestants, sir," said Cecelia,"&#xD;
&#xD;
'&#xD;
55&#xD;
&#xD;
with an injured look, "and would not allow&#xD;
me to go to our church."&#xD;
"She would not .let you go to mass ?" said&#xD;
he, still more doubtfully. .&#xD;
"No, sir," she replied, "she wanted me to be&#xD;
a Protestant, and used to whip me when I&#xD;
asked leave to go to church, and so I ran&#xD;
away."&#xD;
" She had no right to interfere with your&#xD;
religion," said Mrs. Macourty, who believed&#xD;
Cecelia, and admired her courage in adhering&#xD;
to her church.&#xD;
A few days were spent in looking for Cece-&#xD;
lia's mother without any thing being heard of&#xD;
her, and' then Mrs. Macourty said it was a&#xD;
shame that the girl should stay at home idle.&#xD;
Cecelia was sent to a private school in the&#xD;
neighborhood, kept by a lady of much experi-&#xD;
ence and ability, who promised to see that the&#xD;
girl was well cared for and aided in her studies.&#xD;
When she returned from school in the even-&#xD;
ings, after having dinner, she Was allowed a&#xD;
time for play, and was then called in to pre-&#xD;
pare her lessons for the next day. But Cecelia&#xD;
did not fancy such employment, and, instead&#xD;
of studying her lessons, she looked at the pic-&#xD;
tures, played with her slate and pencil, and&#xD;
idled her time, except when Mrs. Macourty sat&#xD;
beside her and watched what she was doing.&#xD;
When visitors came, as they did almost every&#xD;
day, she was called in to see them, and intro-&#xD;
dluced as Mrs. Macourty's adopted daughter.&#xD;
Mrs. McDonald called one day, and took a very&#xD;
kind interest in the young girl, asking her&#xD;
questions about school, play hours, about her&#xD;
books and coianionis, and spoke to her very&#xD;
encouragingly and with much approbation.&#xD;
"You lbave adopted her ?" said Mrs. McDon-&#xD;
ald, after Cecelia had left the room. " I notice&#xD;
she calls you ma."&#xD;
" Yes, we intend doing all we can for her,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Macourty. -" Poor thing, she seems.&#xD;
to have no friends or relatives, and so I told.&#xD;
George I was goinrr to make her one ef the&#xD;
family, and he replied that I could do as I&#xD;
iked."&#xD;
" Robert says that I may adopt a chid when-&#xD;
v-er want to do so," said Mrs. McDonald,&#xD;
'and I have often thought seriously of doing&#xD;
t, but have found no one that I liked exactly."&#xD;
" I am afraid that, if you wait until you are&#xD;
united exactly," said Mrs. Macourty, smiling,&#xD;
you will be a long time making a choice. We&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC8171-00000029"/>&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
all have our faults, but if you took a child I&#xD;
think you would soon come to love so well&#xD;
that you would not part with it."&#xD;
"Oh! I certainly intend to do so," replied&#xD;
Mrs. McDonald.&#xD;
On another afternoon, as Cecelia sat thumb-&#xD;
ing her books, Annie came in, her face full of&#xD;
pleasure and her eyes dancing with excitement.&#xD;
"Come into the parlor, Cecelia," she said,&#xD;
"come into the parlor ~&#xD;
"No, I won't," replied Cecelia.&#xD;
"Oh! yes, do I" said Annie. "Mr. MacVain is&#xD;
in there, and be is such a nice gentleman. He&#xD;
always brings us something good, pictures or&#xD;
oandL~, or apples, or something good! Come in&#xD;
now, quick !"&#xD;
"I shan't do it, I tell you," replied qeeclia,&#xD;
who was out of temper about her lessons.&#xD;
Almost every day at school she woul4 get a&#xD;
scolding about her lessons. The teacher ex-&#xD;
cused her poor recitations for the first two or&#xD;
three months, because she knew that the child&#xD;
had Dot been used to confinement and study;&#xD;
but when this time had passed she '~vonld&#xD;
sometimes get out of patience, and such&#xD;
scenes as the following occurred nearly every&#xD;
'~Why, Cecelia, you do not know this les-&#xD;
son," said the teacher. "Did you study at&#xD;
ho~ne I"&#xD;
"No, ma'am, I'did not."&#xD;
"You did not! well, why not ~"&#xD;
"I don't have time," replie~t Cecelia. "I&#xD;
have to set the table, wash the dishes and help&#xD;
with all the housework."&#xD;
"You do? And Mks. Macouty does not tell&#xD;
you to study at home 1"&#xD;
"No, ma'am, she don't," replied Cecelia4 "She&#xD;
says I must learn to york, so that I can sup-&#xD;
port myself."&#xD;
"That is all very proper," replied the teacher,&#xD;
"but I don't see why she sends you to school,&#xD;
if she will not allow you to prepare your les-&#xD;
eons, at least partially, at home. But I sup-&#xD;
pose she knows her own business."&#xD;
Mrs. Macourty's store-room was well and&#xD;
liberally supplied, and, as she had the most&#xD;
implicit faith in the servants, it was seldom&#xD;
locked. Cecelia saw this, and, al~hongh she&#xD;
was given money to spend on toy~ and other&#xD;
articles that children covet, she thought she&#xD;
'would increase the supply. To do this she&#xD;
'would take from the store-room a flew bottles&#xD;
of wine, cordial or liquor, some soap, starch or&#xD;
&#xD;
other articles, and, hiding them among the&#xD;
bushes in the yard, she awaited a favorable'&#xD;
opportunity, when she would take them out to&#xD;
some corner grocery, and sell them for a quar-&#xD;
ter of what they were worth. Sometimes she&#xD;
told the keeper of the shop that her ma was&#xD;
short of change, and sent her out to sell the&#xD;
articles, and again she would say that her ma&#xD;
had given them to her, and, as she did not&#xD;
want them, she would sell them.&#xD;
In summer she had two months' vacation,&#xD;
and then returned again to school. After she&#xD;
had lived with Mrs. Macour~ about ten&#xD;
months, the time seemed too dull and inactive&#xD;
for her, and she ran away. She had taken a&#xD;
great fancy to Mr. and Mrs. Cheerful, and&#xD;
went to their house. As an excuse for running&#xD;
away, she told them that Mrs. Macourty did&#xD;
not' give her enough to eat, that she had to be&#xD;
a servant for the other children, and that she&#xD;
had been frequently whipped in a cruel and&#xD;
unmerciful manner. Mrs. Cheerful listened,&#xD;
with wonder to the outrageous stories she told,&#xD;
and did not know exactly what to make of it.&#xD;
She had always thougl~t that Mrs. Macourty&#xD;
and her husband were such good people. Mr.&#xD;
Cheerful, when he caine home, was surprised&#xD;
to find Cecelia there, 'and listened to her story&#xD;
with ill-concealed doubt and anger.&#xD;
"You must think we are fools," he said,&#xD;
when she had finished, "to come here telling&#xD;
me that story. Mrs. Macourty is a perfect&#xD;
lady, incapable of harming anyone, or treating&#xD;
anyone cruelly, and her husband is a fine, hon-&#xD;
orable man. Come, you can't stay here. Get&#xD;
ready and I will take you back there. If you&#xD;
want to run aw~y again, do not come here."&#xD;
Mrs. Mahourty had been in a perfect fever&#xD;
all day about the child, and could not imagine&#xD;
what had become of her. When Mr. Cheerful&#xD;
brought Cecelia back again she was much&#xD;
shocked at the tales she had been telling about&#xD;
them, and asked why she had done so. Ce-&#xD;
celia pretended to be very penitent, cried a&#xD;
great deal,, and promised not to do so any&#xD;
more. After this Mrs. Macourty took her back&#xD;
again and the next day she returned to school.&#xD;
The decided manner of Mr. Cheerful disap-&#xD;
pointed Cecelia very much, and from that time&#xD;
she avoided him and his family as much as&#xD;
possible. She pronounced his singing horrid&#xD;
squeaking, his conversation dull and ill-na-&#xD;
tured, and d~iclared him the most disagreeable&#xD;

&#xD;
man she had ever met. She was not long,&#xD;
however, in finding new friends outside of her&#xD;
adopted home~ Mrs. Marie Le Crasseux was&#xD;
the person to whom Mrs. Macourty gave all&#xD;
her sewing that could not be ~done at home.&#xD;
She was a woman much tinder the medium&#xD;
height, small and delicately framed, pale and&#xD;
thin, with large black eyes, the lustre of which&#xD;
increased the unnatural appearance of her&#xD;
thin lips, sunken cheeks, and sharp, straight&#xD;
nose. She looked like a woman who would&#xD;
faint at a spider and sink under the fatigue of&#xD;
ascending one short flight of stairs; yet there&#xD;
are probably few women whose lives are so full&#xD;
of trouble and care, constant work, worry of&#xD;
mind and wear of body, as this poor, broken-&#xD;
spirited woman's 'was. She did much of the&#xD;
sewing, especially the fine work of the neigh-&#xD;
borhood, and long after the last omnibus had&#xD;
rattled by on its way up town, after the last&#xD;
straggler from the theatre or opera had sought&#xD;
repose, and the carts 'and market wagons were&#xD;
wending their way to a new day's business,&#xD;
long after her liege' lord had been tucked into&#xD;
bed and snoring, her needle was flying fast,&#xD;
and night after night, by the dull and gloomy&#xD;
light of her lamp, she pursued this weary,&#xD;
lonely, unending work. She had a large&#xD;
family, and her days were spent in cooking,&#xD;
washing, ironing and mending for them, with&#xD;
now and then a chase to this or that lady's&#xD;
house to return finished garments or to get&#xD;
new work. Some member of her family was&#xD;
always sick, and requiring, medicine and at- 1&#xD;
tension. With all these duties devolving upon&#xD;
her, she, at least, might with much reason cx- 1&#xD;
claim, "A woman's work is never done." Yet&#xD;
she found time to attend church and perform&#xD;
her duties as a Christian, was sometimes social 1&#xD;
with her neighbors, and exhibited a wonderful 1&#xD;
amount of hope and cheerfulness. Her hus- I&#xD;
band was an amiable cross between' the tiger c&#xD;
and the wolf. Mons. Antoine Le Crasseux was I&#xD;
born in one of the border provinces ef France, s&#xD;
and settled in New Orleans in early manhood. C&#xD;
lie was the senior of his wife by fifteen years, ~&#xD;
and exercised his authority as lord and master 5&#xD;
ere the honey-moon had completed its first t&#xD;
quarter. H6 was about five feet ten in height, I~&#xD;
but stooped so that he looked much less than l~&#xD;
that. Stooping forward, his shoulders were 0&#xD;
rounded to almost a deformity, his head t&#xD;
drooped until his chin nearly touched his u&#xD;
chest, the long beard, which covered his hard, il&#xD;
&#xD;
dry face, flowed almost to his waist, and his&#xD;
black hair fell in a loose, uncombed shower of&#xD;
"matted and combined locks" around his&#xD;
neck and shoulders. He was no advocate of&#xD;
the external application of cool, clear water,&#xD;
often going for weeks without washing his&#xD;
hands and face, while, as to bathing or clean-&#xD;
ing his person, he often boasted that he had&#xD;
not done so since leaving his native village.&#xD;
Ho was a moulder and pattern maker in iron&#xD;
work, very tasty and ingenious, a perfect mas-&#xD;
ter of his profession, at which he found, in one&#xD;
of the largest foundries of the city, constant&#xD;
employment at the best wages. He was a&#xD;
"Jack of all trades" with talent and capacity&#xD;
sufficient to rank with the best workmen at&#xD;
any of them that he turned his hands to. As a&#xD;
carpenter, cabinet-maker, paper-hanger, up-&#xD;
holsterer or decorative painter, he had worked&#xD;
with success, at such times as the business of&#xD;
the foundry would be dull, or when he, in a fit&#xD;
of ill-temper,, would leave that place. With&#xD;
all these advantages in himself as a workman,&#xD;
and with a wife who drudged and toiled&#xD;
steadier and more abjectly than any negro&#xD;
cook in the city, he was always poor. His&#xD;
family lived in the smallest, mosttumble-down&#xD;
house, in a neighborhood of small, tumble~&#xD;
down houses, and but for his wife's perseverance&#xD;
in patching, mending, turning and darning.&#xD;
they would have been continually in rags and&#xD;
tatters. In his family wa~ included his nephew,&#xD;
Felix Le Crasseux, a young man of about&#xD;
twenty yeast of age, of medium height and&#xD;
build, with long, sandy hair, a light beard of&#xD;
the same color, ~a florid, badly freckled face&#xD;
md grey eyes, over which hung shaggy, red-&#xD;
lish brows. Some of his front teeth were&#xD;
missing, and those that were yet left were&#xD;
)adly decayed or covered with tartar. In&#xD;
oint of cleanliness he was a little improvement&#xD;
~n his worthy uncle, but scarcely enough "to&#xD;
)rag of." With'this delightful family Cecelia&#xD;
.oon became intimate, and spent many of her&#xD;
evenings with them, relating her woes and in-&#xD;
renting horrid tales of the persecution she&#xD;
uffered in the family of Mr. Macourty. To&#xD;
hese stories, hadehe dared brave her husband,&#xD;
~[adama Le Crasseux would have given~the lie,&#xD;
mt as he listened with satisfaction, throwing&#xD;
ut exclamations, sometimes in Fr ~nch, some-&#xD;
imes in English, of approval and encourage~&#xD;
sent, sh~ kept silent, while the nephew, a&#xD;
Lull, sleepy-looking fellow, half fool and half&#xD;
8&#xD;
&#xD;
57&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8171-00000030"/>&#xD;
knave, swallowed the whole as gospel truth.&#xD;
After an evening spent in such conversation,&#xD;
Felix would escort Cecelia back to Mrs. Ma-&#xD;
vourty's, where she would greet everybody in&#xD;
the most affectionate and confiding manner.&#xD;
She was always careful, when retiring at&#xD;
night, to kiss all the family, with mamAy de-&#xD;
monstrations of love and respect, and when&#xD;
in her room her Ave 3farias and Pater Nosters&#xD;
were so loud and earnest that they could be&#xD;
head by the passers in the streets. Thus the&#xD;
second year and much of the third passed&#xD;
sway when an old friend joined the family&#xD;
once more4&#xD;
CHAPTER xvx.&#xD;
Two years had rolled by, and the autumn&#xD;
frosts were once more giving the leaves a va-&#xD;
riety of rich colors, and the winds, as they&#xD;
ii whistled through the woods, were covering the&#xD;
ground with a leafy carpet, leaving the trees&#xD;
bare and cheerless. The travelers who had&#xD;
thronged Saratoga, Newport, LongBranch and&#xD;
through the Canadas were on the wing for&#xD;
home. The western and southern merchants&#xD;
had replenished their stocks with the latest&#xD;
fashions and patterns of fall and winter goods~&#xD;
and their grain, flour, pork, cotton, rice and&#xD;
other products were now coming forward to&#xD;
restore the "balance of exchanges.~m The&#xD;
great American metropolis was daily becoming&#xD;
more crowded and gay; those who left for dis-&#xD;
tant homes being more than replaced in num-&#xD;
bers by returning citizens and crowds of visit-&#xD;
ors from all parts of the world. Oar old&#xD;
friends, Barege, Muslin &amp;amp; Co., bad been doing&#xD;
their full share of the business of the city,&#xD;
and, rich at first, were rapidly nearing the&#xD;
point of immense wealth and influence. Philip&#xD;
Cummings was now a juuior salesman, that&#xD;
point where the occupant is neither one thing&#xD;
or the other, now an office boy, then a messen-&#xD;
ger, a salesman, and so on, fihlin~ all gaps that&#xD;
occur. He was a favorite with the seniors of the&#xD;
firm, who prophesied that he would be a bril-&#xD;
liant salesman in a short time; but with the&#xD;
junior, Mr. Crape, he was less fortunate, that&#xD;
gentleman still keeping up an old grudge&#xD;
against him. Peter Droll, kind-hearted, gen-&#xD;
erous Peter, was rapidly going down hill in&#xD;
health, and had been obliged to miss many&#xD;
days from his work. The seniors of the house&#xD;
manifested much interest in his case, because&#xD;
&#xD;
he knew the business thoroughly and was a&#xD;
valuable hand, but mainly, let us hope and be-&#xD;
lieve, through kind and Christian feeling.&#xD;
"Mr. Droll," Mr. Barege had often said, "you&#xD;
must take care of yourself. Go down to my&#xD;
house at Elizabeth. There's plenty of good,&#xD;
fresh milk and butter, pleasant walks and&#xD;
shady groves to loiter in. There's a good&#xD;
team and a comfortable carriage always&#xD;
at your service. Come, nQw, don't be foolish,&#xD;
man,~ and shake your head 'at me. Got ready&#xD;
and go over and stay three or four months,&#xD;
just as long ~s you please. It will not costyon&#xD;
anything, and you will be porfect~iy welcome."&#xD;
"Look here, Mr. Droll," Mr. ~Iuslin would&#xD;
sometimes say, and always kindly, "you are&#xD;
not able to stand the worry an~ fatigue of&#xD;
business. Take a trip off wost, ~r south, re-&#xD;
lieve your mind of all care, go *h~re you will&#xD;
s~e the most life and be comfortable. If you&#xD;
run short of money, you know-w ~y just drop&#xD;
a note to me privately and I'll lo~n you what&#xD;
you want, and when you get back 4 few mouths&#xD;
from now, you will soon catch up ~gain."&#xD;
Amongst the clerks of the hous~ there was&#xD;
much shaking of heads and regrets expressed&#xD;
that Mr. Droll was "in a bad way."&#xD;
"Look here, my Scotch Seminole," Sam Sell-&#xD;
well would exclaim, in his off-band way, none&#xD;
the less sincere in idudness and good feeling&#xD;
than othei s who were more choice in their&#xD;
wprds, "look here, Pete, you're trifling with&#xD;
this thing too long. You don't hold a very&#xD;
strong hand, and the first thing you know your&#xD;
pile will be covered, and wl~en the game is&#xD;
called, and you show your hand, you'll find old&#xD;
Death holds all the aces, and there'll be no&#xD;
show for you at all. Take time now to roen-&#xD;
perate and you may euchre the old fellow in&#xD;
spite of his cunning."&#xD;
To all ".'~se friendly solicitations Peter re-&#xD;
'turned cyasive answers, promising to consider&#xD;
the matter. He was of a retiring nature and&#xD;
feared that he would give trouble to others if&#xD;
he accepted the advice given him. There was&#xD;
another and stronger reason for his refusal to&#xD;
go away. His ward, Mary Collins, was pro-&#xD;
gressing rapidly in her studies, and stood&#xD;
among the best scholars in the Institute,&#xD;
where there many that were older than she&#xD;
was. Her music was pronounced excellent,&#xD;
and her voice was wonderfully clear, full and&#xD;
melodious. She had carried off a majority of&#xD;
the prizes at the last examination, and re-&#xD;

attentive to his wants, especially of late when that he should do so.&#xD;
he had been so unwell. His heart, which "What do you say, my little pet  1" he said&#xD;
had been for years a stranger to finer feelings, to her one evening. "Do you want to get rid&#xD;

and which is felt and respected by the rough- "How much money f~o you require, Uncle?"&#xD;
est of men. A woman without religion is like "I went down to see Captain Evans, of the&#xD;

he replied, a slight accent of sadness in his&#xD;
voice, "and if it is God's will, I shall dose soon,&#xD;
but I cannot go without you. It will not be&#xD;
long untilwe can go over together, and then-"&#xD;
"Then what, Uncle Peter I" she said, seeing&#xD;
that he hesitated to complete what he was say-&#xD;

"You will be with our folks, and, if anything&#xD;
happens me, you will have a good home, with&#xD;

promised to lie a father to you, and if death&#xD;
comes for me, I will feel tnore contented at the&#xD;
parting."&#xD;
"Don't talk about death, Uncle," she re-&#xD;
plied, wiping away the tears that were filling&#xD;
her eyes. "You will be strong yet, apd live&#xD;
many a day to guide me with your wise ad-&#xD;
vice, and cheer me with your words of kind-&#xD;
ness.~'&#xD;
"If it is God's will, Mary," he said, kindly&#xD;
caressing her head. "I hope he will spare me&#xD;
to see you comfortable and happily settled in&#xD;
life, but it will do no harm t&amp;amp; provide for the&#xD;
worst, and so I feel that I must get homeY&#xD;
The next day was a busy one at Barege,&#xD;
Muslin &amp;amp; Co.'s, and everybody about the place&#xD;
was on the alert to fill the demands of the&#xD;
throng of customers. A little past noon, as&#xD;
Mr. Craps was standing near the lace depart-&#xD;
ment, he observed Philip, who was showing&#xD;
the shawls and sacks to a very stylish lady in&#xD;
a dark brown silk dreqs, with furs and cape to&#xD;
match. After the lady went out without buy-&#xD;
ing anything, Mr. Craps came forward and&#xD;
reproved Philip for Lrying to wait on the lady,&#xD;
telling him that he should have called one of&#xD;
the elder salesmen. While they were folding&#xD;
up the articles to return them to the boxes&#xD;
and shelves where they belonged, Mr. Crape&#xD;
missed a shawl and asked Philip where it was.&#xD;
"I don't see any such shawl here," said&#xD;
Philip, turning them over and searching&#xD;
througlj. the pile.&#xD;
"It certainly was there a few minutes ago,"&#xD;
replied Mr. Crape, continuing the search with&#xD;
nervous anxiety.&#xD;
" It may have been,, sir, but it is not here&#xD;
now," said Philip.&#xD;
"May have been !" exclaimed Mr. Craps,&#xD;
getting angry. "Didn't you show a s awl&#xD;
marked fifty dollars, withvine embroidery and&#xD;
a large flower center, to that lady."&#xD;
&#xD;
60&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, sir, I did not," replied Philip,&#xD;
"But I know you did, for I heard you say to&#xD;
her 'fifty dollars,' and that was the only one&#xD;
of that style at that price."&#xD;
"I told her that the lace point was fifty dol-&#xD;
lars," replied Philip, but I did not show her a&#xD;
shawl at that price."&#xD;
"You needn't try to get out of it in that&#xD;
way," said Mr. Crape, who 'was by this time in&#xD;
a towering passion.&#xD;
"Get out of what I" said Philip, aroused by&#xD;
this remark.&#xD;
"Oh,.it is. a great deal more convenient,"&#xD;
said Mr. Crape, sneeringly, "wben a young&#xD;
man has a stylish lady friend to allow her to&#xD;
steal a nice ~ha~rl than it is to buy one for her."&#xD;
Without the least hesitation, before Mr.&#xD;
Crape had finished speaking, P~iilip srtruckhim&#xD;
in the face with all the force he was master of.&#xD;
Before a second .blow could be struck by him,&#xD;
or one returned by ,Mr. Craps, three or four&#xD;
clerks 'interfered and separated them. The&#xD;
event created a great sensation. Many of the&#xD;
men rushed forward to see what was the mat-&#xD;
ter, while those who remained in their stocks&#xD;
eagerly inquired of others what was going on.&#xD;
a fight within the sacred precincts of the&#xD;
was something that few of them had&#xD;
ever dreamed of; they were horrified at the&#xD;
idea; and that one of the boys should dare&#xD;
strike a member of the "firm," was even more&#xD;
wonderful. The c~ilprits were ordered back to&#xD;
the offlve, where both of the seniors were pres-&#xD;
ent, and before this "high court" they were&#xD;
at once arraigned.&#xD;
"What does this mean, Mr. Crape? A nice&#xD;
return for my kindness to you, Philip," said&#xD;
Mr. Barege, turning from one to the other, "a&#xD;
pretty state of affairs, indeed. A brawl, a&#xD;
bar-room scuffle, here in the store, with a&#xD;
crowd of customers present."&#xD;
"What was it about, Philip I" asked Mr.&#xD;
Muslin, who was perfectly eQol and quiet.&#xD;
"What was it about I" Mr. Barege broke out&#xD;
again, "that's the question. How dare you&#xD;
kick up a row here ?"&#xD;
"Mr. Crape can tell you all about it," said&#xD;
Philip, motioning towards where that gentle-&#xD;
man was standing silent and sullen.&#xD;
"Well, sir, we are waiting to hear from&#xD;
you," said Mr. Baregc~, turning to his nephew.&#xD;
"I am going home to change my clothes,&#xD;
and bathe my face," replied Mr. Crape, wiping&#xD;
the blood from a small scratch on his cheek~&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF A'~TE J3ELLUM TIMES.&#xD;
&#xD;
"when I get back I will answer your ques-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"Very well, sir, very well," said Mr. Barege,&#xD;
"you can both go until this evening, and then&#xD;
we will hear what you have to say."&#xD;
"For myself," said Philip, stepping forward,&#xD;
"I have very little to say. I am very sorry&#xD;
the fuss occurred in your store, but if it was&#xD;
to do over again, I should act as I have al-&#xD;
ready done, and if we had not been parted I&#xD;
should have done my best to give him a thor-&#xD;
ough whipping. I shall not come back this&#xD;
evening, as I have determined tp leave you, for&#xD;
while I appreciate ymr kind r~ess and thank&#xD;
you for it, I cannot live any lodger with him."&#xD;
As he concluded, he pointed contemptuously&#xD;
at Mr. Crape.&#xD;
This was another surprise, and one that was&#xD;
well founded, for Philip had been kindly treat-&#xD;
ed by the senior partners, and if he remained,&#xD;
had a good prospect as a salesman in the fu-&#xD;
ture. After a short consultation together his&#xD;
employers concluded that it would be best to&#xD;
let him try for a time to get a situation else-&#xD;
where, after which they had no doubt he&#xD;
would be glad to return to them. His account&#xD;
was niade out and Mr. Muslin, while paying&#xD;
him the amount due him, offered his advice on&#xD;
the course that he should pursue for the fu-&#xD;
ture. Philip replied to him respectfully, and&#xD;
with proper deference, and after saying good.~&#xD;
bye to the seniors, and to some of the clerks&#xD;
with whom he was on friendly terms he left&#xD;
the store.&#xD;
As he walked down Broadway, thinking 6f&#xD;
the events of the day and forming plans for&#xD;
the future, he saw two men standing on one&#xD;
of the corners, engaged in earnest conversa-&#xD;
tion, one of these looked so familiar, that he&#xD;
soon remembered that he was Mr. MacVain.&#xD;
As he came forward, Mr. MacVaiA said to his&#xD;
companion.&#xD;
"Another season spent in this fruitless&#xD;
search! It does seem strange that no one of&#xD;
her old companions has ever heard from her.'&#xD;
"It is very discouraging, ~ replied&#xD;
his companion. "I have watched for her in'&#xD;
Boston, Albany, Philadelphia, all over, in fact,&#xD;
and have been assisted by Betsy and two of&#xD;
the best detectives in the country, all without&#xD;
any success."&#xD;
"This old detective, Joe Bodkers, that you&#xD;
say is such a good hand, what does he say V~&#xD;
inquired Mr. MacVain.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
AlA EDI GRAS;&#xD;
&#xD;
"Its a regular puzzler, he says," replied Mr.&#xD;
Williams, "he thinks the girl ipust have died&#xD;
from the effects of the fnght at the fire, or&#xD;
from exposure afterwards, or may be that she&#xD;
was not rescued at all.'&#xD;
"As for that," replied Mr. MacVain, "we&#xD;
have the testimony of Betsy, who is positive&#xD;
that she saw her brought safely out of the&#xD;
house."&#xD;
"That's true, sir," said Mr. Williams, "but&#xD;
if she was saved, where did she go to so sud-&#xD;
denly? You know that is the last that was&#xD;
seen of her."&#xD;
"I have no doubt she was saved," replied&#xD;
Mr. MacVain, "but where she has gone is a&#xD;
mystery I hope we may yet unravel."&#xD;
"Nothing will be left undone, that can as-&#xD;
sist in bringing success," replied Mr. Williams.&#xD;
"I think I shall go home next week," re-&#xD;
plied Mr. MacVain, "these lon~ seasons, which&#xD;
others devote to pleasure and recuperation,&#xD;
hut which are times of racking anxtsty for me,&#xD;
are wearing me out, and I shall hereafter,&#xD;
make them shorter. I hope that you will per-&#xD;
severe, and sodn meet with success."&#xD;
During the latter part of this conversation,&#xD;
Philip had remainedd at a respectful distance,&#xD;
too far off to 'hear what was said, but as he&#xD;
saw the stranger go away, and Mr. MacVain&#xD;
turn to go down town, he stepped quick to&#xD;
overtake him. At first, Mr. MacVain did not&#xD;
recognize him, but when Philip told his nauie,&#xD;
he was received in a very friendly and cordial&#xD;
manner. During their walk, he related to ~lr.&#xD;
MacVain much ot his life since his arrival in&#xD;
New York, and expressed a wish to return to&#xD;
New Orleans. His friend promised that if he&#xD;
did do so he would aid him in procuring a sit-&#xD;
uation, and offered to assist him with aloauo~&#xD;
money to pay his passage. This Philip thank-&#xD;
ed him for, but said it was not necessary as he&#xD;
had saved enough from his wages, small&#xD;
though they had l2~een, to enable him to return&#xD;
to his native city.&#xD;
When Mr. Droll returned that eveningg&#xD;
to h~s home at Mrs. Reed's boarding house,&#xD;
Mary met him at the door, and with a peculiar&#xD;
look of pleasure, mixed with girlish mystery,&#xD;
welcomed him after his day of labor and ex-&#xD;
citement. After their tea, a meal served in&#xD;
the plainest boardinghouse style, they returned&#xD;
So the parlor, and Mary played for him some of&#xD;
the fashionable airs of the day, then sang an&#xD;
old Scotch favorite, which' he always admired,&#xD;
&#xD;
61&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8171-00000032"/>&#xD;
and praised very much. But it was evident,&#xD;
there was something on her mind, she had&#xD;
some secret to tell, or some new triumph at&#xD;
school to surprise her dear uncle with.&#xD;
"What is it, Mary I" he said, as she left th0,&#xD;
piano and took a seat beside him. "Another&#xD;
medal at school, eli? You will lead them all&#xD;
before long, I know you will."&#xD;
"It is not that, Uncle," she replied, looking&#xD;
wistfully into his face.&#xD;
~' What then, dear I" he asked, with an en-&#xD;
couraging look and smile.&#xD;
"Shut your eyes and hold fast all I give&#xD;
you," she said playfully, her fine blue eyes full&#xD;
of anticipated pleasure. Mr. Droll complied,&#xD;
and to his surprise received in his hand six&#xD;
ten dollar gold pieces.&#xD;
"Why child, what does this mean ?" he&#xD;
asked, as soon as he had sufficiently recovered&#xD;
from his surprise to speak.&#xD;
"You-said, Uncle," she replied, "that if we&#xD;
had sixty dollars, you would go with Capt.&#xD;
Evans, and so I got you themoney.~'&#xD;
"But how did you get it I" he anxiously in-&#xD;
quired, "if by m~# refining and wishes to go&#xD;
home, I have induced you to do anything not&#xD;
strictly honest, or to beg or bemoan your-&#xD;
self-"&#xD;
"Uncle, uncle ~ she exclaimed, and her&#xD;
beautiful face flushed with pain, that he&#xD;
should have such thoughts of her, even for a&#xD;
moment.&#xD;
"Forgive me, Mary, I know that you are all&#xD;
truth and honor," he said, as he looked into&#xD;
her distressed face, "but I was surpmiscd that&#xD;
you could get such a sum."&#xD;
"The money came honorably into my&#xD;
hands," she replied, "it is the last legacy ot&#xD;
my poor mother, but had I prized it a thous-&#xD;
and times more than I did, I would have part~&#xD;
ed with it and felt happy in doing so, since it&#xD;
will enable you to take a recess of which you&#xD;
stand so much in need."&#xD;
~!y dear Mary," he said; kindly patting her&#xD;
head, "perhaps you have done wrong in parL&#xD;
irig with this money, if your mother left it to&#xD;
you, for a time of distress and want, f~r I&#xD;
think we might get alopg~ without it for a&#xD;
while yet."&#xD;
"No, no, dour uncle," she replied, coaxingly,&#xD;
"keep the money and let us go new. When&#xD;
you get back next fall, you will I trust, be&#xD;
fully restored to *health. Just think what a&#xD;
&#xD;
happiness it will be to me to see yen strong&#xD;
and well once more, and to think that I aided&#xD;
a little, if ever so little, In bringing about so&#xD;
desirable an end as the restoration of your&#xD;
health,"&#xD;
"It shall be as you say," Mr. Droll replied&#xD;
"and I will go to-morrow to close the bargain&#xD;
with Capt. Evans. He is a very nice man, a&#xD;
native of Maine, and under4ands his business&#xD;
thoroughly."&#xD;
This matter being thus settled, )4r. Droll&#xD;
gave Mary some account of the disturbance at&#xD;
the store, and of Philip's leaving there. While&#xD;
he was speaking, Philip came in.&#xD;
"There is the bad boy now," said Mr. Droll'&#xD;
as he came in.&#xD;
"If I thought such was really your opinion,&#xD;
I should feel very sorry, indeed," said Philip,&#xD;
as he took a seat near them.&#xD;
"What will you do now, Philip I" Mary in-&#xD;
qtlire(l. -&#xD;
"Oh! he will go l;ack again in a week or&#xD;
two," said Mr. Droll.&#xD;
"You are mistaken for once," replied Philip,&#xD;
"I am going to New ~&#xD;
"To New Orleans !" exclaime&amp;amp;Mary.&#xD;
"Yes, it is my native place," said Philip'&#xD;
"my father was a prominent merchant there&#xD;
for many years, and had many friends, I will&#xD;
try my fortunethere."&#xD;
"I am sure you will succeed, Philip," replied&#xD;
Mary, "if you continue to be as steady and at-&#xD;
tentive as you have been here."&#xD;
"I shall try hard for success," he said. "I&#xD;
thank you, Mary, for your good opinion, which&#xD;
I assure you I prize beyond all other consider-&#xD;
ations."&#xD;
"My advice or commendation are of little&#xD;
value," she modestly replied, "but I hope you&#xD;
will gain golden opinions from those to whom&#xD;
you go, and that you may ever remember that&#xD;
there is One above whose service is more honor-&#xD;
able and whose rewards are far greater than&#xD;
those of earth."&#xD;
"Where ever I go, Mary your good counsel,&#xD;
your words of encouragement and kind friend-&#xD;
ly interest will ever be remembered," h.3&#xD;
replied. -&#xD;
"I am glad to hear you say so, Philip," she&#xD;
answered with childish simplicity, "we have&#xD;
spent happy hours together, and it will always&#xD;
be a pleasure to me to know that I am kindly&#xD;
remembered, especially as we are soon to go to&#xD;
a country strange and new to me."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
A TALE OF ANTE BELL UAf TIMES.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You are going away!" exclaimed Philip.&#xD;
"Yes, we are going to Scotland," replied Mr.&#xD;
Droll, "I shall tell them at the store, to-mor-&#xD;
row, and ges ready to go on the Oakwood next&#xD;
week."&#xD;
The evening was spent in discussing their&#xD;
plans for the future, and with many expres-&#xD;
sions of friendship and mutual good wishes&#xD;
they at last separated. Having nothing to de-&#xD;
tain him, and being anxious to get back to the&#xD;
scenes of his childhood, Philip left for New&#xD;
Orleans on the second day after.&#xD;
The eventful Saturday caine, the time inter&#xD;
evening seeming even shorter than our friends&#xD;
had anticipated. The good ship Oakwood,&#xD;
Capt. Evans, master, was ready for sea, and&#xD;
the last preparations were being hurried to&#xD;
completion. Mary was already on Jinoard, and&#xD;
Mr. Droll, who had gone on shore to procure a&#xD;
few nice articles for food that he thought 'they&#xD;
might want on the voyage, wasjust returning,&#xD;
when Mr~ Seliwell, the last of his friends who&#xD;
came down, shook him warmly by the hand,&#xD;
and, almost &amp;amp;rying, bade him God speed.&#xD;
- "Good bye, Pete, good bye, old boy," said Sam'&#xD;
as Mr. Droll reached the deck of the vessel.&#xD;
"God bless you my hearty, and may you come&#xD;
back fat and sound as a buck."&#xD;
Mr. Droll returned the salutations of his&#xD;
friend, and as the vessel left her modring, went&#xD;
below to Mary.&#xD;
"Here we are Mary, all right," he said,&#xD;
cheerfully, "your room is next to mine, so that&#xD;
if you are sick or want anything, you can easi&#xD;
ly call me."&#xD;
"We will be very comfortable, uncle," she -&#xD;
replied, "and I hope we shall have a quick&#xD;
and pleasant trip."&#xD;
"I hope so, dear," he said, "we start in good&#xD;
trim, anyhow, as we have a hundred dollars&#xD;
in gold, our passage is paid, and if we should&#xD;
run short of funds-why, I can get sixty or&#xD;
eighty dollars for my watch. Come let us go&#xD;
on deck, and take a look at the old place, it&#xD;
i9ill be the last we shall have for several&#xD;
months."&#xD;
They stood on the deck as the vessel passed&#xD;
out of the river and down the narrows, and aL t&#xD;
though they had many a time before, seen the '~&#xD;
boats running in the harbor, had often passed ~&#xD;
the picturesque' valleys, and groves of Staten a&#xD;
Island and The gray walls of Fort Hamilton o&#xD;
those objects, and everything around possessed a&#xD;
an interest that they had never felt before. f&#xD;

CIIAPThR XVII.&#xD;
The house of George Macourty was one of&#xD;
the best in the city, having inherited a good&#xD;
reputation from the founder of the business.&#xD;
By close attention, and strict integrity, Mr.&#xD;
Macourty had extended his trade slowly and&#xD;
surely, meeting every engagement promptly,&#xD;
dealing with his patrons in a fair, just and&#xD;
honorable manner that ensured him their fu-&#xD;
ture custom. There was no dash or brilliance,&#xD;
no wild speculation about his business, but all&#xD;
the details were carefully attended to, cease-&#xD;
less energy and never tiring perseverance were-&#xD;
employed, and success had followed. He we'-&#xD;
now able to keep a large cash balance aiway-.&#xD;
on hand to meet the drafts of those who con-&#xD;
signed goods to him, to take advantage of an~&#xD;
llnctuations in the markets and to cover ar~&#xD;
the contingencies of his business. Beside~.&#xD;
this, he owned considerable real estate, and wn~&#xD;
the holder of sto~~ka, bonds and mortgages t~&#xD;
a large amount. His business was now so ex-&#xD;
tensive and profitable that each year the bal-&#xD;
ance sheet showed a haudsomeaddition to hi'&#xD;
fortune.&#xD;
* It was a morning in November when a young&#xD;
man passed along the street, evidently in&#xD;
search of some place he had seen before, for a~&#xD;
lie walked on, ha read the signs over the doot-"&#xD;
af the stores, and occasional paused t~observ~&#xD;
what was going on within. Ev9rywbere th~&#xD;
evidences ~f a prosperous business were to be&#xD;
men, boxes and bales of goods were arriving&#xD;
md departing, clerks were engaged in selling&#xD;
mud shipping, slid all through the streets bus-&#xD;
~le and activity prevailed. In front of Mr.&#xD;
~aconrty's store there were long rows of casks&#xD;
)f ale and wine, boxes of foreign liquors, and&#xD;
)ales of imported goods. A clerk was receiv-&#xD;
ng goods as the draymen brought them from&#xD;
he ships, another was marking the packages&#xD;
hat were sold and yet to be sent off, and two&#xD;
irarehousemen were moving the goods about&#xD;
s they directed. The young man asked one&#xD;
f the clerks if Mr. Macourty was in, and was&#xD;
answered in the affirmative, that he could be~&#xD;
mud in the office up stairs.&#xD;
&#xD;
63&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8171-00000033"/>&#xD;
The merchant was in his easy office chair'&#xD;
reading the morning paper, and so intently&#xD;
engaged that he did not notice the young&#xD;
man's entrance.&#xD;
"Do you want another clerk, sir ?" inquired&#xD;
the young man.&#xD;
"Not at present," replied Mr. Macourty,&#xD;
without looking up.&#xD;
"Could you tell me where I would be likely&#xD;
to find a place I"&#xD;
"Really I conld not," replied Mr. Macourty,&#xD;
carelessly. The book-keeper, who had been&#xD;
busy over his books, looked around and with&#xD;
a smile, kindly said, that he did not know of&#xD;
any vacancy at tbat time.&#xD;
"Good morning, sir," said the young man,&#xD;
and wfth a disappointed iook he turned away.&#xD;
"You want a situation ~ said Mr. Macourty,&#xD;
suddenly throwing down the paper.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I am looking for a place where I&#xD;
can earn a living, and am willing to work,"&#xD;
replied the young man.&#xD;
"What can you do ?" inquired Mr. Macour-&#xD;
ty, in an absent-minded tone, for something&#xD;
about the young man's thee had struck him as&#xD;
being very familiar, and he was trying to think&#xD;
where he had met him before.&#xD;
"I write a good hand and am tolerably&#xD;
quick at figures, I-"&#xD;
"What is y9ur name ?" said Mr. Macourty&#xD;
interrupting him.&#xD;
Philip Cummings, sir, my father Peter&#xD;
Cummings "&#xD;
"Why certainly," exclaimed the gentleman,&#xD;
again interrupting* him, now 'shaking bands&#xD;
with hiji, and looking very much pleased; "I&#xD;
ought to have known you at once, Philip. I&#xD;
~m glad to see you, very glad to see you, come&#xD;
in here and sit down. Why ~rs. Macourty&#xD;
will be delighted to see you I am sure, you&#xD;
must go with me to dinner-certainly, I de-&#xD;
clare, you look very natural, but have grown&#xD;
very much. Mr. Browsee-Philip," he said,&#xD;
introducing the book-keeper, "Philip is an old&#xD;
favorite of ours," he continued, "and the son&#xD;
of a much loved friend. Take a seat, Philip,&#xD;
and tell us all abont your adventures for these&#xD;
-let me see-it must be sekv en or eight years&#xD;
since you left us 1"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, it is," replied P~iilip.&#xD;
"How is your Uncle, and ow did you leave&#xD;
the family-well-eh 1"&#xD;
"Very well, indeed, sir," said Philip, "my&#xD;
uncle is an excellent man, a~d treated me as if&#xD;
&#xD;
04&#xD;
&#xD;
I had been his own eon; in fact, they were all&#xD;
very kind to me, and I owe them much love&#xD;
and gratitude."&#xD;
"I am pleased to hear you say so," relied&#xD;
his friend, "there is nothing more commend-&#xD;
able in a young man, than a proper estimation&#xD;
of the kindness of those to whose care he has&#xD;
been indebted. You want a situation? Well,&#xD;
I will try to make room for you, it will be a&#xD;
poor place at first but you can work up, you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"I shall do my best to do so."&#xD;
"I think you can make him assistant entry&#xD;
clerk, Mr. Browsee," he said, thei~ addressing&#xD;
Philip he continued, "you will have some en-&#xD;
tries to make, letters to copy, go to the post-&#xD;
office and bank, get bills of lading signed, and&#xD;
so on. Mr. Browsee will initiate you. Your&#xD;
salary will be fifty dollars month, and if you&#xD;
improve, as I am sure you will, it will be in-&#xD;
creased. I want th~ best of help about me and&#xD;
never quibble about salary when I am pleased&#xD;
with a clerk's services."&#xD;
Philip expressed hi~ thanks to his friend, and&#xD;
after a short time spent in conversation, the&#xD;
business of the day was resumed, in which the&#xD;
young man at once commenced to take his&#xD;
part. Mr. Leonard Brow~ee, who was immedi-&#xD;
ately over him and from whom all of his in-&#xD;
s1rt~ctions and orders would come, was a man&#xD;
about twenty-five years of age, tall and' slen-&#xD;
der, affable and gentlemanly in his manner.&#xD;
He had been with Mr. Macourty for the past&#xD;
five or six years, and had discharged~ his duties&#xD;
faithfully and with untiring energy. His con-&#xD;
stant application to business and watchful&#xD;
care of his employers ~aterests, had gained his&#xD;
confidence and esteem and the management of&#xD;
the books, cash and office, affairs of the house&#xD;
were now left entirely to him. Constant con-&#xD;
finement, long and laborious office hours, and&#xD;
the ever present ambition to become more and&#xD;
more useful in the business, had gradual-&#xD;
ly worn out the strength of Mr. Brow-&#xD;
see, who was at best never very strong, and&#xD;
he was now an invalid, often more ~lt for the&#xD;
sick ward of an hospital, than the active du.&#xD;
ties of the office. His employer frequently&#xD;
urged him to take a vacation, or to throw&#xD;
some of his duties off on the other clerks, but&#xD;
he felt justly proud of his position in the&#xD;
house, and the high estimation placed upon his&#xD;
services, and would never consent to leave his&#xD;
&#xD;

said Le Crasseux.&#xD;
"I suppose you didn't bath twice the day&#xD;

Le ~rasseux doggedly.&#xD;
"I don't see any foolery about keeping one's&#xD;

"Well I do," replied Le Crasseux with a&#xD;
sneer, "I dont believe in washing your healMi&#xD;

in America."&#xD;
"Whoop-pee !" exclaimed Joe, "well I'll be&#xD;

"I am not, however," replied Le Crasseux,&#xD;
'with emphasis, "I haven't taken a bath since&#xD;

"You are a dirty dog," said Joe, indignantly.&#xD;
"You are not fit to associate wth gentlemen,"&#xD;

"You are a disgrace to the city," said Toni.&#xD;
"Go on; what do I care what you say,"&#xD;

"You haven't taken a bath since you were&#xD;

"No; nor.for years before," was the reply*&#xD;
"And you say you don't intend to ?" again&#xD;
asked Joe.&#xD;
" I don't intend to and I won't," said Le&#xD;
Crasseu'r.&#xD;
"Well, you shan't stay in this place and&#xD;
make that boast," said Joe. "Come on, boys,'&#xD;
let's give him a taste of cola water."&#xD;
Without further words, Joe seized npon Le&#xD;
Crasseux, and the others assisted in carrying&#xD;
him to a back room of the foundry, where&#xD;
there were long,~ deep troughs filled with wa-&#xD;
ter. While Joe held him, in a grasp that de-&#xD;
fied all his turning and struggling to getaway,&#xD;
the rest of the men pulled off his shoes, coat&#xD;
and other clothes, when they lifted him up&#xD;
and placed him in the water; or~e now ran for&#xD;
soap, and another for the coarse roller towel&#xD;
used for their hands and faces. Le Crasseux&#xD;
was then well soaped and r~abbed, and hi~&#xD;
head thoroughly washed, after which he was&#xD;
rubbed down with the crash and allowed to&#xD;
dress. He came out a new man in looks, but&#xD;
&#xD;
66&#xD;
&#xD;
with an additional quantity of vinegar in his&#xD;
disposition.&#xD;
When he returned to his home that night a&#xD;
thunder-cloud of anger hung over his dark&#xD;
brow and made his face even more forbidding&#xD;
than nonal. He had not the courage or spirit&#xD;
to show his resentment to the men at the&#xD;
foundry, but spent his afternoon in sullenly&#xD;
brooding over the treatment he had received&#xD;
at their hands. Ilia wife saw at once, when&#xD;
he entered, that there was something wrong,&#xD;
and fastened to put the children out of the&#xD;
way and give him his supper.&#xD;
The impending storm was averted; however,&#xD;
by the entrance of Cecelia and Felix, who had&#xD;
been taking a walk together. Cecelia was a&#xD;
great favorite with him; they were kindred&#xD;
spirits; he always took great pleasure in&#xD;
hearing her wild stories and encouraging her&#xD;
in making complaints against her adopted&#xD;
parents. There was, too, a friendship springing&#xD;
up between his nephew and the girl,,which he&#xD;
encouraged, hoping that it would lead to their&#xD;
union for life.&#xD;
Cecelia had a surprise for him, one that he&#xD;
hardly knew whether to feel pleased at or not.&#xD;
After a long recitation of her wrongs, the&#xD;
slights put upon her and the oppression&#xD;
under which she suffered, in telling which&#xD;
he encouraged her, although he believed&#xD;
them false, she announced that she 'had&#xD;
left Mr. Macourty's house, and asked him&#xD;
to give her a home, until such time as she&#xD;
could get work to do that would support her.&#xD;
He did netlike this, because he did not believe&#xD;
she would try to get another place, but, once&#xD;
with his family, would become a fixture, and&#xD;
further, he knew it would damage her pros-&#xD;
pects for the future, in which he felt an inter-&#xD;
eat, on account of the plans he had formed for&#xD;
his nephew.&#xD;
"DQn't you think it0wou~d be better to try&#xD;
to get along with them for a few mouths&#xD;
longer V' he asked.&#xD;
"I can't do it, sir," she replied, with a down-&#xD;
cast look, "I can't stand it, sir, I must leave&#xD;
them."&#xD;
"I never heard of such persecution,~~ said&#xD;
Felix, who wished to have her in his uncle's&#xD;
house, so that he would have a better oppor-&#xD;
tunity to pay his attentions .to her, "it is a&#xD;
shame for people to act so and put on such airs&#xD;

angel, with noiseless steps, is approaching&#xD;
more surely to his prize. ~&#xD;
In the night Mary awoke and heard Mr.&#xD;
Droll in his room, which was next to her own,&#xD;
coughing -violently, and breathing short and&#xD;
hard between the, spells, as if ins great dis-&#xD;
tress. Hastily throwing on her dress, she en-&#xD;
tered his room and found that the spell had&#xD;
brought on a hemorrhage, and he was now&#xD;
throwing up large quantities of pure arterial&#xD;
blood. To her, the minutes seemed hours and&#xD;
dragged slowly along through time while the&#xD;
attack lasted. The cough shook and con-&#xD;
vulsed his whole frame, while he was almost&#xD;
suffocated by tlie blood t1zat- filled he, throat,&#xD;
ever and again coming out in a frightful&#xD;
stream. At last he fell back upon the pillow,&#xD;
weak and exhausted, a deathly palor spread-&#xD;
ing over his face, and the throbbing of his&#xD;
pulse comirrg so soft and slow that it was al-&#xD;
most lost altogether. When it was near&#xD;
morning another attack came, nearly as se-&#xD;
vere and long as the first. After this he fell&#xD;
into a sleep which lasted until after 10 o'clock-.&#xD;
As they did not go to breakfast the Captain&#xD;
came into the 'room, and when he saw Mr-.&#xD;
Droll he shook his. head omino,usly and went&#xD;
out again. In a few minutes he returned'&#xD;
took the invalid's band and felt carefully for&#xD;
the pulse, looked carelessly around the&#xD;
room, and -was leaving again when Mary&#xD;
asked what he thought of Mr. Droll.&#xD;
" Well, he may last as far as LiverpooI," he&#xD;
said, shrugging his shoulders.&#xD;
" Mag last ! Do you think him so low Cap-&#xD;
tain I" anxiously inquired the girl.&#xD;
"Just as low as he can be and live," he re-&#xD;
plied. " I didn't much think he could stand a&#xD;
sea voyage, but I never thought it would take&#xD;
him so sudden." .&#xD;
"Is there nothing that could be done, sir I Do&#xD;
you know of anything that would do him-&#xD;
god " she asked.&#xD;
" Humph! not a thing-he's very low-&#xD;
pbably won't last through the night-but&#xD;
te confounded disease has so many turns that&#xD;
you can never tell," anI with these words he&#xD;
left the room. -&#xD;
Mary watched patiently by his side until he&#xD;
awoke and looked languidly around the room.&#xD;
When he saw her he smiled and then closed&#xD;
his eyes again, as if he was too much worn out&#xD;
to keep them open. She watched him again,&#xD;
&#xD;
silently and saddly, and when he again awoke,&#xD;
asked how he felt.&#xD;
" Much better,!' was tbe reply, but the feeble&#xD;
tone of his voice anl the traces~of pain on his&#xD;
death-like countena cc made a different an-&#xD;
swer.&#xD;
Mary went to the cook-room and got a cup&#xD;
of coffee for herself, and after some difficulty&#xD;
procured for her uncle a cup of tea and a little&#xD;
toast. There was no fresh meat on the ship,&#xD;
not even a chicken, and she was, therefore,&#xD;
obliged to take such refreshment as she could&#xD;
get. But she found Mr. Droll too weak to take&#xD;
anything more than a sup of the tea, after&#xD;
which he slept again.&#xD;
He was much refreshed afterwards, and&#xD;
with a look of grateful love asked Mary to go&#xD;
and lie down, saying that he feared that she&#xD;
would be worn out with watching. This she&#xD;
gently refused to do, but remained with him,&#xD;
paying such little' attentions as she could. The&#xD;
day passed quietly aivay and but one little&#xD;
hemorrhage came on during. th~e night. Thus&#xD;
the day's and nij~hts passed with no other&#xD;
change than that the invalid was growing&#xD;
weaker all the time. Mary was constant in&#xD;
her attentions. No daughter could have been&#xD;
more gentle and loving. Every care was taken&#xD;
by her to keep the room in cheerful and clean&#xD;
order, to make his bed comfortable and his&#xD;
position easy. Such articles of nourishment as&#xD;
they had provided, or could be obtained on the&#xD;
ship, Miary prepared for him with her own&#xD;
hands, and out of very little succeeded in&#xD;
making dishes that were pleasing and accept-&#xD;
able to him. In these labors she .neither re-&#xD;
ceived assistance or encouragement from any&#xD;
one attached to the vessel., The Captain&#xD;
seemed to avoid all communication with tiem,&#xD;
for fear of being troubled to do something for&#xD;
the sick man.'&#xD;
After a night of broken rest, short spells of&#xD;
sleep, interrupted by spells of coughing, made&#xD;
worse by a slow fever tht~dstldon him&#xD;
Mr. Droll was taken with another fit of spitting&#xD;
blood, which frightened the young watcher so&#xD;
that she hurried out to hunt up the captain&#xD;
and beg his assistance'.&#xD;
" What's the use i" he replied, .impatiently.&#xD;
" I can do nothing for him. If he holds cut&#xD;

"Why, you can't fix him," replied the cap-&#xD;
tain. "It's not fit work fox~ a delicate young&#xD;
thiiug like you."&#xD;
Mary ~ave such directions as ~he thought of&#xD;
in relation to the arrangement of the corpse&#xD;
and then left the room. When she returned&#xD;
he was dressed in a neat suit of black clothes,&#xD;
with a nice shirt and well-tied cravat; his&#xD;
hair had been combed back from his forehead&#xD;
and his face cleanly shaken. She felt grateful&#xD;
to the captain for this kind attention, and be-&#xD;
lieved that beneath a rough exterior he car-&#xD;
ried a good heart. Mr. Droll's watch guard, a&#xD;
plain black ribbon, was around his neck&#xD;
as he always' 'wore it, with the end in his&#xD;
vest pocket, and, as she wished to know the&#xD;
time, she' pulled it out, but the watch was&#xD;
gone. She thought the captain had so ar-&#xD;
ranged it, in order to keep the watch from&#xD;
being buried with him, and recognized in the&#xD;
act another evidence of his watchfulness and&#xD;
forethought.&#xD;
During the night she watched alone with the&#xD;
corpse of her friend, and thought through the&#xD;
dark hours of the night of how great to her&#xD;
was the loss of this only true friend, who had&#xD;
been to her like a father. She could not think&#xD;
of the future, of what she would do, now that&#xD;
he was gone. The present, the dark, storm-&#xD;
clouded present, hung over her withthe gloom&#xD;
of a pall, and she could only think of her kind,&#xD;
&#xD;
70&#xD;
&#xD;
indulgent friend, uncle and father, as he lay&#xD;
there before her in the cold and rigid form of&#xD;
death. There was one friend she thought of&#xD;
and whose presence would have cheered the&#xD;
gloom that surrounded her. During their long&#xD;
acquaintance Philip Cummings had joined in&#xD;
her studies and sports, had sympathized with&#xD;
her in her troubles and trials, and had always&#xD;
taken an interest in whatever engaged her.&#xD;
There had been no set ways or speeches be-&#xD;
tween them, no artificial plans to win con-&#xD;
fidence or esteem. They had played, studied,&#xD;
sung and walked together without any thought&#xD;
of being more than friendly and agreeable.&#xD;
When they had d~ffercd in opinion on any sub-&#xD;
ject, or in wish about any recreation, they had.&#xD;
spoken candidly and without any attempt at&#xD;
an agreeability they did not feel. Yet a friend-&#xD;
ship, a mutual esteem, and a deep interest in&#xD;
each other's welfare, had sprung up between&#xD;
them, which was all tl~e more deep and sin-&#xD;
cere, and was likely to prove the more durable,&#xD;
because it sprung up unheeded ~nd unsought&#xD;
by either, She thought often during that long&#xD;
night how grieved Philip would fc9l when he&#xD;
heard of the death of Mr. Droll, who had been&#xD;
so kind to them both, and how sincerely he&#xD;
would, sympathize with her if he was only&#xD;
present.&#xD;
Early next morning the captain came in,&#xD;
attended by one of the men, who carried some&#xD;
ropes. He was surprised to find her there and&#xD;
more so when he learned that she had watched&#xD;
all night.&#xD;
"Well, I think it's all nonsense to watch&#xD;
with a dead man," he said, with a careless,&#xD;
rude manner, "just like it would do him any&#xD;
harm to remain alone."&#xD;
"It may be foolish," she replied, "but it is&#xD;
customary, and, I think, is but a poor tribute&#xD;
to the memory of a dear, lost friend."&#xD;
"Well-well-as you like," he replied, im-&#xD;
patiently. "I suppose you want to say goid&#xD;
bye to him; if so, hurry up, so that we can&#xD;
put him over before the sun gets very high."&#xD;
"Put him over, Captain I" she exclaimed,&#xD;
"you surely are not in earnest."&#xD;
"To be sure, I am," he said. "Didn't you&#xD;
ever hear that people who die at sea are buried&#xD;
in the water."&#xD;
"Such things I know occur on emigrant&#xD;

greeted her very kindly, and listened with in-&#xD;
terest to her account of the long and patient&#xD;
Suffering, last illness, death and burial of his&#xD;
brother. To his demand for his brother's mon-&#xD;
~ey and watch, the Captain returned the same&#xD;
answer as he had done to Mary. Finding that&#xD;
hie protests and arguments were useless Mr.&#xD;
Droll told the Captain to have the baggage&#xD;
put ashore and they would leave him.&#xD;
"I want the passage money for your brother&#xD;
and this fast young lady," replied the Captain.&#xD;
"My brother wrote me the day before he&#xD;
left New York," replied Mr. Droll, "that he had&#xD;
paid the passage money."&#xD;
"Well, sir, I don't care wii at he wrote you.&#xD;
The passage money has not been paid," replied&#xD;
the Captain.&#xD;
"He would not tell a lie alout it, Captain,"&#xD;
said Mr. Droll, "and I can show you the letter."&#xD;
"I don't want to see the h4ter,~~ replied the&#xD;
Captain, "I want the monet, and I will have&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"The passage was paid," said Mary, feeling&#xD;
in the pocket of her sack for the papei~, "and&#xD;
here is the receipt."&#xD;
"The receipt she produced was in the hand-&#xD;
writing of Mr. Peter Droll, and was for the&#xD;
passage of himself and niece, but in the hurry&#xD;
and excitement of getting ready to leave New&#xD;
York, he had s~egZected to get it signed. The Cap-&#xD;
tain's triumph was complete, and without fur-&#xD;
ther argument Mr. Droll asked the amount 91&#xD;
the bill.&#xD;
"Well, as there has been some misunder-&#xD;
standing," replied the Captain, "I will let you&#xD;
off with twenty pounds, although it ought to&#xD;
be at least forty, as I had the trouble of nurs-&#xD;

To this Mr. Droll made no other reply than&#xD;
te pay the money and order the baggage put&#xD;

* When they arrived at the hotel where Mr.&#xD;
Droll had stopped, he procured a room for&#xD;
Mary, where she was comfortable and could&#xD;
enjoy a little repose.&#xD;
"You must be worn out my dear child," he&#xD;
said to her, "and we will thereforeremain here&#xD;
.a few days, so that you can get rested and re-&#xD;

events of your voyage. After that we will go&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
The stekidy perseverance with which he un-&#xD;
dertook the duties devolving upon him and the&#xD;
tact and ability that he displayed in business,&#xD;
soon gained for Philip the entire confidence of&#xD;
his employer. He had a decided advantage in&#xD;
being a favorite with Mrs. Macourty, who&#xD;
treated him as she would have done a son, and&#xD;
never tired in her praises of him to her hus-&#xD;
band. In addition to this his father had been&#xD;
an esteemed friend of Mr. Macourry's, and a&#xD;
man who had stood without a blemish or re&#xD;
preach in social and business circles. Many&#xD;
of his evenings were spent at Mr. Macourty's&#xD;
residence, and here every thing was done to&#xD;
make the time pleasant to him. He accom-&#xD;
panied Mrs. Macourty and Annie, sometimes&#xD;
with George and Cecelia, in her visits to their&#xD;
friends, and was thus soon introduced into a&#xD;
large and agreeable circle of aequantances,&#xD;
from whom he received numerous invitations&#xD;
to parties and social gatherings, that took up&#xD;
much of his spare time. On Sundays and oth-&#xD;
er holy days, he occupied a seat in Mr. Ma.&#xD;
county's pew at St. Patrick's, and was atten-&#xD;
tive to his duties, earning an enviable reputa-&#xD;
tion everywhere he went. Mrs. Macourty of-&#xD;
ten talked with him about her little daughter,&#xD;
in whose rescue he had manifested so much in-&#xD;
terest at the time ~he was kidnapped. He&#xD;
sympathized with her sincerely in her grief at&#xD;
that loss and entered fully into the hope that&#xD;
some day, the child would yet be recovered.&#xD;
It did not matter how long she talked on the&#xD;
subject, he always listened with interest, and&#xD;
kept up his part of the conversation in a man-&#xD;
ner that showed his heart was in the matter.&#xD;
Under these circumstances it was no wonder&#xD;
that her heart warmed to him, and that he&#xD;
soon became with her almost as dearly loved&#xD;
as one of her own children.&#xD;
One of his first acts after entering the office&#xD;
of Mr. Macourty, was to write to Mary, and&#xD;
inform her of his good fortune. This letter&#xD;
was written with great care, read, corrected&#xD;
and re-written, for now that they were separ-&#xD;
ated by so many miles of distance he felt more&#xD;
delicacy in addressing her, than he had done&#xD;
when they were together. After finishing the&#xD;
letter to his satisfaction, ho directed it to her&#xD;
at the town in Scotland where he knew she&#xD;
was going with Mr. Droll, and carried it to the&#xD;
post office to mail it himself. Months rolled&#xD;

&#xD;
away and there came no answer. Had she for-&#xD;
gotten him? This question recurred to him&#xD;
frequently, and began to possess far more in-&#xD;
terest than he had ever thought it would. He&#xD;
remembered the pleasant hours they had pass-&#xD;
ed together, the child-like innocence of her&#xD;
manner, her cheerful disposition, and her&#xD;
words of encouragement, and the thought that&#xD;
other friends now filled her mind, and had&#xD;
caused her to forget him, weighed heavily&#xD;
upon his heart. He would often run over the&#xD;
list of those he now visited, and compare&#xD;
them with her, but there w~s none so beauti-&#xD;
fuland good as she was. At last, his letter&#xD;
came back to him. It was returned through&#xD;
the Dead Letter Office, with the simple en*&#xD;
dorsement, made by the Scotch post-master,&#xD;
"no such person resides here, or is known in&#xD;
this neighborhood." What could t~is mean?&#xD;
He had agreed with her before they parted&#xD;
that his letters should be directed to her per-&#xD;
sonally, and now the first~ one, had come hack,&#xD;
without having been called for. For several&#xD;
days he carried the letter in his pocket, fre-&#xD;
quently reading the postmaster's remark on&#xD;
the back of it, a~id pondering over the singu- j&#xD;
lar manner in which Mary was acting. Then&#xD;
in a fit of anger and mortification he tore the&#xD;
letter up, and distributed it in little pieces as t&#xD;
he walked along the street, determining in d&#xD;
his own mind that she did not wish to hear h&#xD;
from himand that it was beneath Iris dignity~&#xD;
to trouble her any more. This amiable frame&#xD;
of mind lasted for several weeks, during which&#xD;
he made himself pleasantly miserable, by&#xD;
brooding over the uncertainty of earthly af- r&#xD;
fairs, and the changeableness of female nature&#xD;
in particular. He then began to think with&#xD;
more reason about the matter, and remember- a&#xD;
lag the guileless sincerity and candor of Mary,&#xD;
came to the conclusion that something unex-&#xD;
pected had occurred, a shipwreck perhaps, and&#xD;
he therefore wrote to Mr. Peter Droll, directing&#xD;
the letter to the care of his brother John. a&#xD;
During this time he was attentive to his&#xD;
businesss, and in his leisure was sociable with&#xD;
the many now friends he made. The with- h&#xD;
drawal of Cecelia from the house of her adopt- ~&#xD;
ed parents, was an unexpected surprise to! 0&#xD;
him, a step that he was at a loss to account V&#xD;
for. Mrs. Macourty was much annoyed at the ~'&#xD;
circumstance, and troubled to think of the fa-&#xD;
ure that s'ch 00 nduct would lead to. Her P&#xD;
husband felt less interest in the matter. He a&#xD;
&#xD;
.~WARDI GRAS;&#xD;
&#xD;
argued that they had done all they could for&#xD;
the child, and as she continually showedd by&#xD;
her action's that she was incapable of uppre'&#xD;
citing their kindness, it was their duty to le~&#xD;
her take care of herself. But his wife felt an&#xD;
interest in the wanderer, and wished to per-&#xD;
se'vere in the effort to redeem her from her&#xD;
wild, uncouth ways. She was very indignant&#xD;
at the Le Crasseux family, and when that lady&#xD;
called she was received in a very cool manner.&#xD;
Mine. ]~e Crasseux protested that she was op-&#xD;
posed to receiving Cecelia in her house, and&#xD;
that she had neither encouraged or believed&#xD;
her stories. After the matter was explained&#xD;
to her Mrs. Macourty felt sorry for the little&#xD;
woman and fully Oxcused her from all blar~io&#xD;
in CecePa's flight.&#xD;
After an absence of two months Ce~ielia be-&#xD;
~an to think of the comforts of the home she&#xD;
had left, and requested permission to return~&#xD;
&amp;amp;t first Mr. Macourty refused to give his con-&#xD;
lent, but the rezoning of his wife and the&#xD;
~pecial pleading of the children, with a good&#xD;
~'ord from Philip, changed his resolution, and&#xD;
he girl was once more taken back into his&#xD;
~rmily.&#xD;
While at Mrs. Macourty's one evening, Philip&#xD;
earned that Mr. MacVain had called to see&#xD;
hem, and had required for him. The next&#xD;
Lay he called at that gentleman's office to seo&#xD;
Lim, and was very kindly received.&#xD;
"So you are with Mr. Macourty ?" said Mi~&#xD;
lacVain.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I am an assistant in the office,"&#xD;
replied Philip.&#xD;
"I am very glad to hear it," said his friend,&#xD;
it is one of the best houses in the city, and&#xD;
s you have a footing there, with attention to&#xD;
business your fortune is made."&#xD;
"I am very well satisfied," replied Philip.&#xD;
"Yes, yon ought to be," said Mr. MacVain,&#xD;
for Mr. Macourty is an excellent man, kind&#xD;
ud just, and fins the reputation of paying as&#xD;
liberal salaries as any one in town."&#xD;
"He pays splendidly, every man about the&#xD;
ouse is paid a good salary, besides which they&#xD;
eli me that a Christmas never passes without&#xD;
ach one receiving a liberal present in money,&#xD;
dth kind messages that are as grateful to the&#xD;
~elings as the present is acceptable."&#xD;
"That's very nice, and just like him !'~ he re~&#xD;
lied, and a shadow of sadness came over him&#xD;
s he thought of the deep injury he had done&#xD;

this excellent man," I do not know a better,&#xD;
man than George Macourty."&#xD;
As Philip was leaving, two Sisters of Chari-&#xD;
ty entered, and quietly waited until Mr. Mac-&#xD;
Vain was at leisure.&#xD;
"Good morning, ~ said that gentle-&#xD;
man, in a kind and encouraging manner,&#xD;
"what can I do to serve you."&#xD;
"We are raising funds, sir," one of them&#xD;
replied, "to paint our asylum. It has not been&#xD;
done for a long time, and is necessary both for&#xD;
the comfort of the orphans under our care,&#xD;
and as a means of preserving the building.&#xD;
"'We also need some winter clothing for the&#xD;
children."&#xD;
Mr. MacVain bowed again, and received from&#xD;
her the .subscription list from which he read,&#xD;
haf aloud, "Robert McDonald, one hundred;&#xD;

one hundred; Alfred Plant, one hundred;&#xD;

body under twenty-five dollars yet."&#xD;
"We have another list in this little book,"&#xD;
~~id the Sister, "on which are the names of&#xD;
such as can only give a little, for every sum,&#xD;
however small is acceptable."&#xD;
Mr. MacVain wrote en the paper, "Percy&#xD;

of his clerks, who had been with him for a&#xD;
long time and managed his business for him,&#xD;
when he was out of the city. "Albert May-&#xD;

hundred each," and directed his cashier, Mr.&#xD;
Maylaud to give him "four hundred dollars&#xD;
sand charge it to expense account."&#xD;
Philip took the small book from the Sister,&#xD;
and inscribing there "cash, ten dollars,"&#xD;
banded the amount to her, and bidding Mr.&#xD;
MacVain "good day," returned to his busi-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
The season was one of activity and prosperi-&#xD;
ty in commercial matters, and the city was&#xD;
very gay and lively all the time. In the sum-&#xD;
mer Mrs. Macourty went over to Biloxi, and&#xD;
her husband spent much of his time there&#xD;
also, leaving Mr. Browace in charge of the&#xD;
business. Mrs. McDonald atid many others of&#xD;
the city p ased the warm season on the lake&#xD;
shore, and Philip made several pleasant visits&#xD;
to them d ring the summer.&#xD;
&#xD;
ChAPTER XX.&#xD;
After a day or two passed in perfect quiet,&#xD;
Mr. John Droll took Mary around the city,&#xD;
pointed out the beautiful buildings, visited&#xD;
some of the places of amusement, and exerted&#xD;
himself to make the time pleasant and to draw&#xD;
her mind from the grief and trouble that op-&#xD;
pressed her. She was never tired of praising&#xD;
his brother, and would sit for hours relating&#xD;
incidents connected with their home in New&#xD;
York, dwelling with much pleasure on his&#xD;
kind and generous acts, his honorable reputa-&#xD;
tion with all who knew him, and the 'gentle&#xD;
and quiet interest he always manifested in her&#xD;
studies and amusements.&#xD;
"Well, Mary," said Mr. Droll, when they&#xD;
had been a week in Liverpool, "I think we&#xD;
may get jeady now to go home."&#xD;
"I have been thinking of that, Mr. ~&#xD;
she answered, with some hesitation, as if she&#xD;
hardly knew ho~w~ to word what she had to&#xD;
say, "I am grateful to you for your kind at-&#xD;
tention, as, indeed, I ought to be, but I-the&#xD;
truth is, with all thanks to you, I have resolved&#xD;
to return to New York."&#xD;
"Return-return, why what do you mean?&#xD;
It can't be, no, no, don't think of it," exclaimed&#xD;
the surprised gentleman.&#xD;
"I do not doubt the sincerity of your friend-&#xD;
ship in your offer of a home," she replied, "but&#xD;
I have thought the matter over well, and I&#xD;
must go back."&#xD;
"I'll ~wait a week or so longer," he' said,&#xD;
earnestly hoping that she would alter her&#xD;
plans, "and perhaps you wiil change your&#xD;
mind. I promised Peter in my letters to him,&#xD;

for her passage home, and offered her fifty up town. It was' a dingy looking brick house,&#xD;

&#xD;
about the place denoted that the inmates&#xD;
lived, or rather "got along" with as ~Iittle&#xD;
work as was possible. Mrs. Scraps was a very&#xD;
tall woman, with a sharp, thin figure, a small&#xD;
mouth, with lips that were drawn close, and&#xD;
cheeks sunken and colorless. Her eyes were&#xD;
sharp and darting, and seemed to read the&#xD;
thoughts, at times, of those who applied for no.&#xD;
accommodations, for by these quick glances she&#xD;
decided whether she would get paid or not, and&#xD;
was usually correct. The class that she enter.&#xD;
tained~was made up of clerks, sewing women&#xD;
and others whose incomes were too small to in-&#xD;
dulge in many of the luxuries of life. Mary&#xD;
was furnished with a small back room on the&#xD;
second story and in it spent her time while in&#xD;
tbe house, feeling too sad after the events of&#xD;
the past few months to associate with the&#xD;
other boarders. There was not much sociabili-&#xD;
ty about the house, nearly all the boarders,&#xD;
knowing the hours for meals, came in just in&#xD;
time, and aftet~ hurrying through with their&#xD;
repdst.lcft again, but there were a few who&#xD;
frequented the parlor, from whence Mary of-&#xD;
teji heard the sounds o~ loud talking, laugh-&#xD;
in~ and singing, varied occasionally by a per-&#xD;
formance on the piano, which though old and&#xD;
ou~ of tune, was yet capable of producing that&#xD;
which would pass for music to ears not thor.&#xD;
ou~hly educated.&#xD;
After thanking Captain Tollis for his atten-&#xD;
tions, Mary had her baggage removed to her&#xD;
ro~,m arid there sat down to write a letter to&#xD;
her friend, Mr. John Droll, informing him of&#xD;
her safe arrival in New York, and the thought-&#xD;
ful attentions of C4iptain Tollis, informing&#xD;
him also that the Captain was an American.&#xD;
She now began to seek for some employment&#xD;
which would yield income sufficient to pay&#xD;
her expenses. She applied in many stores for&#xD;
sewing without success, some had already en-&#xD;
gaged their full compliment of hands, others&#xD;
were .well supplied with manufactured articles&#xD;
and a few considered it "between seasons,"&#xD;
and would give out no more work for a time.&#xD;
Thus two or three weeks passed awny, every&#xD;
day was spent in making applications, now as&#xD;
a teacher in some school, but here she was re-&#xD;
fused generally on account of her youth,&#xD;
again she would answer an advertisement for&#xD;
seamstress or nurse, or ask for a position as&#xD;
sales-woman in some millinery or fancy goods&#xD;
establishment all without success.&#xD;
&#xD;
One d~iy she stepped into an intelligence&#xD;
office, w ich she had often passed before, and&#xD;
had beg a to wonder if it was not possible&#xD;
that she might get something to do through&#xD;
that me mm. The old man who kept the&#xD;
place, Ic ked surprised to see in his shop look-&#xD;
ing for ork, one so young, good looking and&#xD;
evidently carefully brought up, and asked&#xD;
what sh could do. After hearing her qualifi-&#xD;
cations, he said that for a fee of fifty cents in&#xD;
advance he would register her name, and. if&#xD;
possible procure a situation for her. Mary re-&#xD;
plied that she might call again and went on&#xD;
her way. She had not gone far, before a hand&#xD;
was gently laid on her shoulder and a voice at&#xD;
her side inquired, "I beg your pardon, Miss,&#xD;
but are you looking for a situation ?"&#xD;
The stranger was a man of thirty or thirty-&#xD;
five years of age, with moustache and neatly&#xD;
trimmed whiskers, light complexion and an&#xD;
easy self-confident, air, not too ln'u8quc to be&#xD;
agreeable.&#xD;
"Yes, sir-I would-be glad to find a place,"&#xD;
replied Mary.&#xD;
"What can you do? What sort of a place&#xD;
would you prefer," inquired the man.&#xD;
"Well, really I would not refuse any means&#xD;
of honestly earning a support,~~ she replied,&#xD;
wondering what he wanted her to do.&#xD;
'~ Exactly-but you have a choice I" he&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"I think I could teach," she replied,&#xD;
thoughtfully, "I have had a very good educa-&#xD;
tion, but they all say I am too young."&#xD;
"Not at all !" he exclaimed, "If you have the&#xD;
education, your youth will be no objection."&#xD;
"I ant very glad you think so, sir," she re-&#xD;
plied, "for my money is nearl~r gone, and I am&#xD;
anxious to do something."&#xD;
"You have some money I"&#xD;
''Oh! yes, sir, a little, forty~ or fifty dollars,''&#xD;
she said, encouraged at the t~no of his voice,&#xD;
"but of courBe I am anxious t~ get something&#xD;
to do before that is gone."&#xD;
"Very right, you're perfectly right," ho re-&#xD;
plied, "and I am glad I met y~u, for we want&#xD;
industrious, energetic persons like you."&#xD;
"Do you want teachers, sit I?" she inquired.&#xD;
"We want persons in every branch of indus-&#xD;
try, arts and sciences," lie replied, with digni-&#xD;
ty, "I am Andrew W. Hudlestone-you may&#xD;
have heard of me. I am agent for~ the Great&#xD;
Western Emigrants, Benefit and Protective&#xD;
Industrial Association, we are engaged in&#xD;

hot-bed of misery and crime to the bountiful&#xD;
fields of the far spreading west. Already this&#xD;
year have we rescued from hunger and starva-&#xD;
tion, if not from a far worse fate, thousands of&#xD;
residents of this over crowded city."&#xD;
"Can I call at your office, sir I" she inquired.&#xD;
"Office, Miss," he said, in injured tone, "we&#xD;
have no office 1,ere. In this sinful place we&#xD;
want "no 16c:sl habitation," although we have&#xD;
a "name~~ that has already become the terror&#xD;
to the wolves of this city. No-no -in the&#xD;

our head-quarters, and now in every directio11&#xD;
we are spreading our influence, everywhere&#xD;
the busy hum of the industry of a happy pee-&#xD;

"I could teach, besides English," said Mary,&#xD;
anxious to make an impression on so dis-&#xD;
tinguished a person, "needle work, embroidery&#xD;
and music."&#xD;
"You are just such a person ~is we want,"&#xD;
he said, "you will prove in your dress and&#xD;
manners an excellent example to the children&#xD;
of Pietyville, and I have no doubt but that you&#xD;
are competent as a teacher of all you have&#xD;
np~ned. Yes, ~ on are just what is needed."&#xD;
"I-I don't know how to get there," said&#xD;
M ry.&#xD;
'I have a company who are going inaday&#xD;
or two," he replied. "There are Dearly a hun-&#xD;
dr d of them in all, and I will call on you and&#xD;
gi e you all the particulars. i'll call this&#xD;
ev nin'~"&#xD;
'The expense, sir-how much does it cost to&#xD;
g there" she inquired.&#xD;
'The passage and other expenses will be&#xD;
about eighty dollars."&#xD;
"I have not got that much, sir," she replied.&#xD;
~ worry over that," he said, blandly.&#xD;
"We pay your expenses to Pietyville out of the&#xD;
association funds, and when you get there&#xD;
twenty or thirty dollars a month Will be de-&#xD;
ducted from your ~alary until the amount is&#xD;
repaid. But yoi~ see that will be easy on you,&#xD;
as we shall probably pay you seventy-five dol-&#xD;
lars a ninth, and furnish you with board,"&#xD;
"That i~ a very large salary," she answered,&#xD;
delighted at the brilliant prospect before her.&#xD;
"Oh, we pay well in the west. It is not&#xD;
like here in this corrupt place," he replied&#xD;
&#xD;
with enthusiasm7 "and the best enterprise in&#xD;
the whole country is that of the Great Western&#xD;
Emigrants Benefit and Protective Industrial&#xD;
"I am very glad to hear it, for according to&#xD;
your terms even the poorest person can go&#xD;
there," said Mary.&#xD;
"Yes, miss, no matter how poor they may be&#xD;
so they are of good character," he replied,&#xD;
with a severely honest look, I' but we admit&#xD;
none but those who are strictly honest and re-&#xD;
liable. No money is necessary-of course it is&#xD;
well to have some money along in ease of ac-&#xD;
cident-but it is seldom that emigrants have to&#xD;
use it."&#xD;
They had been walking up town during this&#xD;
conversation, and when the gentleman said&#xD;
that he could not go any further at that time,&#xD;
Mary gave him her address, and he promised&#xD;
to call at Mrs. Scrap's and see her. This he&#xD;
did frequent ly during the next three or four&#xD;
days, and dwelt so enthusiastically on the ad-&#xD;
vantages offered by the Great Western&#xD;
Emigrants' Benefit and Protective Industrial&#xD;
Association, that Mary settled with Mrs&#xD;
Scraps and prepared to leave for the serene&#xD;
and beautiful city of Pietyville.&#xD;
The expressi~inn called for her baggage, and&#xD;
she took an omnibus and soon reached the-&#xD;
Hudson River Railroad Depot, the point from&#xD;
which the new additions to the western city&#xD;
were to depart. Here she was met by Mr.&#xD;
Andrew XV. Hudlestone, who excused himself&#xD;
for not calling for her in person, by sayingthat&#xD;
his timo had been so occupied with the other&#xD;
emigrants and the details of their startingthat&#xD;
he had not had time.&#xD;
"There, sit down here." he said, when they&#xD;
were in one of the ladies' cars, "the other&#xD;
members of our company are in the forward&#xD;
cars, but they are so crowded don't think you&#xD;
could find a scat now. When we get on to the&#xD;
Central road we will get a car to ourselves,&#xD;
and I will introduce you. I'll be backin afew&#xD;
minutes."&#xD;
saying which he departed to take care of the&#xD;
baggage and get the tickets for the company.&#xD;
There was a busy crowd around the depot, and&#xD;
the children that flitted  o and fro selling&#xD;
cakes, candies, fruit and papers reminded her&#xD;
of the time when she was an apple girl on the&#xD;
streets of the groat city. Hard and trying as&#xD;
were those days, she now looked back to them&#xD;
with pleasure, and shuddered to thhik of the&#xD;

&#xD;
trials through which she had passed since that&#xD;
time~ The car filled up rapidly and she knew&#xD;
by the movements of those around her that&#xD;
they were about to start when Mr. Andrew W.,&#xD;
Hudlestono returned.&#xD;
"I declare, there never was anything so un-&#xD;
lucky," he said, "my cashier, instead of meet-&#xD;
ing me here, as. I directed him to do, has gone&#xD;
to the upper depot. It's too bad, for I am&#xD;
short of money and cannot get the tickets."&#xD;
"That is unfortunate," said Mary, anxiously.&#xD;
"What will you do 7"&#xD;
"I am only sixty dollars short," he replied'&#xD;
in a low tone, "and if you have that much let&#xD;
me have it, and I will return it at the upper&#xD;
depot."&#xD;
"I have not got so much," said Mary, pro-&#xD;
ducing her portmonnaie, "but you can have&#xD;
what there is."&#xD;
"I will try and get th~ rest of some ot' those&#xD;
in the front car," he replied, as he started in&#xD;
that direction, after counting her money. "I&#xD;
have fifty-two dollars here."&#xD;
He left the car and in a few minutes more&#xD;
they started for the upper, depot. She waited&#xD;
his return, but as he did not come, ~he thought&#xD;
he would join her at the upper depot. When&#xD;
they arrived at that place there was a few&#xD;
minute~ of noise and confusion, and then the&#xD;
steam engine took them off at a rapid rate.&#xD;
Still the agent of the Great Western&#xD;
Emigrants' Be efit and Protective Industrial&#xD;
Association di~l not come.&#xD;
"Your ticket, miss," said the conductor,&#xD;
stopping by h ~r seat.&#xD;
"The gentle an with my ticket is in the&#xD;
other car," sh answered.&#xD;
The polite c uductor bowed and passed on.&#xD;
'The train flew on ~niles and miles away from&#xD;
the great city. Here, on one hand, was the&#xD;
beautiful Hud on, rolling grandly to the sea,&#xD;
with rocky cli A's on the other shore, here and&#xD;
there a residence looking out from the forests&#xD;
that lined the bank, and on the other side of&#xD;
the road walls of hewn stone, high peaks, run-&#xD;
ning brooks and prosperous villages.&#xD;
"Tickets !" shouted the conductor, as he&#xD;
entered the car. ~9ary did not know what to&#xD;
du. She had no money and Mr. Hudlestone I&#xD;
had not returned. "I have no ticket, sir,"&#xD;
she snid to the conductor. "The gentleman&#xD;
who was to have brought me one has not re-&#xD;
turned."&#xD;
&#xD;
The man looked at her for a few moments as&#xD;
if studying her features and deliberating on&#xD;
what he should do.&#xD;
"Where were you going I" he inquired.&#xD;
"To the west, sir," she answered.&#xD;
"And who was the man you were going&#xD;
with I" he asked, still looking curiously at&#xD;
her, to see if she acted honestly.&#xD;
"Hudlestone, sir."&#xD;
"You gave him your money 7" he inquired.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I loaned it to him, but he said&#xD;
he would give it back at the upper depot in&#xD;
the city," she replh~d.&#xD;
"Have you known him long 7"&#xD;
"Only a short time, sir," she answered.&#xD;
"He said he was agent for the Great West-&#xD;
em Emigrant's Benefit and Protective Indus-&#xD;
trial Association, and I was going to their city&#xD;
in the west. He said there was about one hun-&#xD;
dred other emigrants on this train going to the&#xD;
same place."&#xD;
-' I am sorry for you," he replied, "for you&#xD;
never .will see your money or that sharper&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"What do you mean 7" Mary anxiously In-&#xD;
quired.&#xD;
"I am sure the fellow was an imposter," he&#xD;
replied. "He has got your money; that is all&#xD;
he wanted, and you will never see him again."&#xD;
"What will I do 7" she asked, as the truth&#xD;
became so plain. "I have no money and no&#xD;
friends. What will I do 7"&#xD;
"Well, miss, I can't say,~~ he replied. "This&#xD;
is getting to be a common trick with the&#xD;
sharpers, and ought to be stopped by the&#xD;
police. It has left many a poor person without&#xD;
iends and money."&#xD;
"I would never, have suspected such a nice&#xD;
1 oking gentlemm~n of so base an action," she&#xD;
s id, "and now-dear me-what can I do 7"&#xD;
"You had better go back to New York,"&#xD;
a id the conductor, kindly, "I'll see 1~hat you&#xD;
a e passed back free of charge.~~&#xD;
Mary accepted his offer with many thanks&#xD;
a d after a weary journey found herself once&#xD;
more in the boarding-house of Mrs. Scraps.&#xD;
That lady was not much surprised a~ her story.&#xD;
She sneered at her verdancy and hoped it&#xD;
would learn her a lesson.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
Once more Mary began the dreary round of&#xD;
application for work, something that would&#xD;
&#xD;
give her a living. Her money was now all&#xD;
gone and the confidence that the possession of&#xD;
even so small a sum gave hew, was wrecked&#xD;
with its loss.&#xD;
"Teacher-hum-yes, there's one vacancy,"&#xD;
said Mr. Sa7eall, an ex-Onion merchantt, as he&#xD;
looked over his eye-glasses at the youthful&#xD;
candidate. "Don't think you'll do-too young&#xD;
-no use."&#xD;
"You do house work ?" said Mrs. Wilson, as&#xD;
she threw herself on a sofa and eyed the girl&#xD;
in a calculating way, "no-I don't want you.&#xD;
You would get sick and be on my hands I&#xD;
don't know how long."&#xD;
"I am really sorry, cissy,~~ satd the good&#xD;
nature Mrs. Plump, "but I have just engaged&#xD;
a nurse for the baby. It's too bad, a young&#xD;
thing like you, so well brought up, so lady-&#xD;
like and tidy, should have to live out."&#xD;
"Governess! Take you for governess in my&#xD;
family!" said Mrs. Greeneyes, "a handsome&#xD;
young girl like you-no indeed! My husband&#xD;
is doubtful enough anyhow, but with you&#xD;
here-no, I don't want you. Go. You look&#xD;
brazen enough to make me sick I"&#xD;
And so it happened that there was always&#xD;
something in the way, until, heart-sore and&#xD;
almost worn out, she applied for work to a&#xD;
manufacturer of ready made clothing. The&#xD;
man looked i~t her for a few minutes, evidently&#xD;
considering whetherr it would be advisable to&#xD;
try her or no~. At last he produced a bundle&#xD;
of vests that~ had been cut out during the day,&#xD;
and directed ~her to do the best with them she&#xD;
could. Sh~ tooi~ the bundle and hurried home&#xD;
with it. Mrs. Scraps was pleased to see that&#xD;
she had obt~dned work, for she had begun to&#xD;
feel uneasy about her pay, which was nearly&#xD;
three weeks behind.&#xD;
Mary worked industriously at the vests, ansi&#xD;
when she returned with them on Friday the&#xD;
proprietor of the store, after a careful exami-&#xD;
nation of them, said they would do and paid&#xD;
h~r for the work and gave her more. The al-&#xD;
~, owance was small, but she hoped, by close&#xD;
application, not only to pay her expenses, but,&#xD;
little by little, to clear what ~he was already&#xD;
behind.&#xD;
I've changed you," said Mrs. Scraps, when&#xD;
she returned~&#xD;
"Changed me?" said Mary, not nndergtand-&#xD;
ing what wa~ meant.&#xD;
"Yes. I n~oved you on to the third floor,"&#xD;
&#xD;
replied Mrs. Scraps. "A gentleman who&#xD;
boarded with me two or three years, and then&#xD;
left, came back to-day and wanted his old&#xD;
room. He is a very nice man, Mr. SeUwell is~&#xD;
and as you were in his room I had to move you&#xD;
up to give it to him."&#xD;
Mary could make no objection to this as she&#xD;
was in debt to Mrs. Scraps, and was, in a&#xD;
measure, dependent on her; but she felt zunch&#xD;
grieved at the careless manner in which she&#xD;
was treated, and the rough indifference shown&#xD;
to her wishes and comfort. Hurrying to her&#xD;
new room she put down the work she carried,&#xD;
and taking a chair, leaned her head on the&#xD;
bedside and gave way to the sad thoughts that&#xD;
filled her mind~ She was alone, and felt with&#xD;
crushing weight the troubles and trials that.&#xD;
surrounded her. Her thoughts flowed back&#xD;
over the time when her mother welcomed her&#xD;
return every night to their little home in&#xD;
Brooklyn, to~ the happy days spent with her&#xD;
uncle, kind ]~'eter Droll, and of a~l the friends,&#xD;
then so kind, Philip only remained, and he w~s&#xD;
in a distant city. She had not heard from him&#xD;
and migbt never do s~, yet she thought it&#xD;
would be cheering to know that at least one&#xD;
friend remembered her.&#xD;
Recovering frofli her despondency, she re-&#xD;
solved to work more constantly until free from&#xD;
del~t to Mrs. Scraps. Early and late her needle&#xD;
was going, and the time given to her meals&#xD;
was begrudged, so intent she had become on&#xD;
the hope of showing Mrs. Scraps that she&#xD;
could be independent. Sometimes, as she&#xD;
passed up and down stairs, she heard others&#xD;
enjoying themselves in the parlor, or met Some&#xD;
of the gentlemen on the steps or in the hall,&#xD;
but she went quickly on thinking of her work&#xD;
and the object to be gained by it. This con-&#xD;
finement soon began to affect her health; her&#xD;
cheeks were pale, her eyes black and sunken,&#xD;
a nervous fever, with terrible headaches op-&#xD;
pressed her, and ~it times she was obliged t~&#xD;
rest from her work. One dark, rainy afternoon&#xD;
she ventured out to return some articles she&#xD;
had made, and when returning a sudden&#xD;
shower came up, and, before she could get,&#xD;
shelter, she was completely drenched with wa-&#xD;
ter. By the time she reached home she was in&#xD;
a violent chill, which lasted. for a long time&#xD;
and left her in a high fever. On the following&#xD;
day she was unable to get up at all, and when&#xD;
Mrs. Scraps came up about eleven o'clock she&#xD;
found her very sick. She was given a little&#xD;

tea and left to herself until dinner time when&#xD;
a plate of soup was sent up, which she could&#xD;
not eat, and at night the tea was repeated.&#xD;
For three days this attention continuedbut,&#xD;
on the fourth, the girl was so much worse that&#xD;
Mrs. Scraps sent her son Johnny for Doctor&#xD;
Keep. When the doctor saw the invalid he&#xD;
shook his head dubiously and said that he&#xD;
ought to have been sent for at least three days&#xD;
before.&#xD;
"Uncle Peter, you must go," said Mary,&#xD;
opening her eyes and glancing wildly around.&#xD;
"Don't think of me; I will get along."&#xD;
'~She is out of her head," said Mrs. Scraps.&#xD;
"Yes, she is a very sick girl," replied the&#xD;
doctor, and, after some further consideration,&#xD;
he wrote the preserijtion and gave directions&#xD;
about her diet and nursing. As they came&#xD;
down stairs some of the gentlemen who had&#xD;
just finished dinner were standing in the ball.&#xD;
"Get some ice and keep her head cool; gWe&#xD;
her a little ice-water to drink," said the doct r.&#xD;
"Let some one stay with her all the time and&#xD;
give the medicine regularly.~l&#xD;
"Couldn't she be sent to the hospital 7"&#xD;
asked Mrs. Scraps.&#xD;
"No, madam, not at all," replied the doctor,&#xD;
positively. "If you moved her now it would&#xD;
be sure to kill her, and without great care she&#xD;
eann~t recover oven here."&#xD;
"Who is 'sick?" asked one of the gentlemen,&#xD;
after the doctor had left.&#xD;
'~The girl that had your room before you&#xD;
came back," said Mrs. Scraps.&#xD;
"Indeed! I am sorry to hear it," said the&#xD;
gentleman.&#xD;
"Yes; I am sony, too," replied Mrs. Scraps.&#xD;
"Johnny, g~ get a carriage.~~&#xD;
"What for, mother 7" the boy asked.&#xD;
"To take the girl to the hospital," said Mrs.&#xD;
Scraps.&#xD;
"You certainly do not intend to send her&#xD;
away now," said the gentleman.&#xD;
"Why not, Mr. SelIwell 7"&#xD;
"She is too sick," replied Mr. Sellwell.&#xD;
"Didn't you hear the doctor say it would kill&#xD;
her to be moved 7"&#xD;
"Ths; and he said that she mtst have a&#xD;
nurse," said Mrs. Scraps, "and nourishment,&#xD;
medicine and all that sort of thing."&#xD;
"Well, of course she must," replied Mr. Sell-&#xD;
well.&#xD;
"Certainly! Oh, to be sure !" said Mrs.&#xD;
Scraps, angrily, "but how is she to get them?&#xD;
&#xD;
I can't get them. She owes me now for board,&#xD;
and I am not bound to take care of all the&#xD;
stray children of New York."&#xD;
"Well, but-Mrs. Scraps-"&#xD;
"John, get that carriage," shouted the land-&#xD;
lady, stamping her foot impatiently.&#xD;
"Not 50 fast, Mrs. Scraps," said Sam Sell-&#xD;
well. "You shall not send her out doors for&#xD;
want of money as long as I am here. I'll pay&#xD;
the btlls; so lot her stay."&#xD;
"You must be getting rich," said Mrs.&#xD;
Scraps, with sarcasm.&#xD;
"Not to hurt," replied Sam, "but you know&#xD;
I always pay what I say I will, and so far as&#xD;
that goes my word's as good as Mr. Barege's.&#xD;
I don't know this girl, wore than I've seen her&#xD;
two or three times passing up and down stairs,&#xD;
but as long as I've got a dollar no poor creature&#xD;
shall be turned out of a house I'm in for the&#xD;
want of it."&#xD;
"That may be very well for you, Mr. Sell-&#xD;
well," replied Mrs. Scraps, still much out of&#xD;
humor' as you have nobody but yourself to&#xD;
look out for, of course you can do as you please&#xD;
but I can't afford such luxuries."&#xD;
"I say I'll pay' the bills," said Sam, with&#xD;
eznphas~s, "don't that make it right 7 Get a&#xD;
nurse for her and send for what is wanted. To-&#xD;
night I'll bring you twenty dollars, gud more&#xD;
hereafter if you need it."&#xD;
"You'll pay all the expenses 7" inquired Mrs.&#xD;
Scraps.&#xD;
"Yes, I'll pay you the girl's board, too," re-&#xD;
plied Sam. "What money I am short I can&#xD;
get from our company. So, now, you must see&#xD;
that she is well cared for."&#xD;
"I'll do that," said Mrs. Scraps.&#xD;
"Mind now," said Sam, impressively, "if I&#xD;
find you neglecting or slighting her I'll leave&#xD;
your house and never do another hands' turn&#xD;
for you. Just see to it.'~&#xD;
"Very well, Mr. Sellwell, I shall do all I&#xD;
can," said Mrs. Scraps.&#xD;
It was three weeks before Mary was suf-&#xD;
ficiently recovered to leave her room. Mrs.&#xD;
Scraps had informed her of Sam Sellwells'&#xD;
generosity, and with a few polishes to her own&#xD;
exertions in Mary's behalf, said that Mr. Sell-&#xD;
well was the best man she ever knew. In the&#xD;
evening Mary went down to the parlor and&#xD;
was introduced to her benefactor and some of&#xD;

&#xD;
'who were counted more prudent than Dick&#xD;
were in the habit of "running their faces,"&#xD;
and Dick, after a sh~ug of the shoulder and a&#xD;
thoughtful roll of his cigar, troubled his mind&#xD;
no more about the matter. When the new&#xD;
clothes wer~ put on he praised the patterns,&#xD;
admired the styles and claimed the "beverage"&#xD;
on each new article. On the same morning&#xD;
Mr. Macourty was walking up and down his&#xD;
elegantly furnished office in deep thought, Mr.&#xD;
Drowses had been sick for several weeks, and&#xD;
had returned to his desk 6n the daybefore, but&#xD;
in such poor health that it was evident that he&#xD;
~onld not permanently resume his duties for&#xD;
some time to come. Mr. Macourty was much&#xD;
attached to him and felt very s'olicitons about&#xD;
his recovery, but thus far all overt4 res looking&#xD;
to a trip for recuperation had been~ refused by&#xD;
his clerk. ~Ie had not made his 4ppearance,&#xD;
although it was nearly ten o'cloc~r, and Mr.&#xD;
Macourty had concluded that he w4s worse, or&#xD;
had prudently remained at home. ~s he took&#xD;
another turn in his walk, ho ever, Mr.&#xD;
~rowsee entered the office, mnfile~l up in a&#xD;
great coat of beaver cloth, with a large plaid&#xD;
scarf aroi~nd his neck and his hands covered&#xD;
with warm woolen gloves. He w~ s looking&#xD;
miserable indeed, and took a seat w~th the air&#xD;
of a man completely exhausted.&#xD;
"Good morning, Len, how do yoti do feel ?"&#xD;
eaid Mr. Macourty, cheerfully.&#xD;
"I am getting better, sir," was the reply.&#xD;
"I have been thinking of you," said Mr.&#xD;
Macourty, seating himself near by and laying&#xD;
his hands kindly on the others knee, "and I&#xD;
have concluded that you must go off for a&#xD;
trip."&#xD;
"I don't think it necessary," replied Mr~&#xD;
Browsee, with an effort to kok easy, "I am&#xD;
getting better."&#xD;
"I hoye you are, Len, I believe you are," re-&#xD;
plied Mr. Macourty, "but next month is March,&#xD;
the worst time in the year in a damp climate&#xD;
like this for an invalid, and I am anxious that&#xD;
you should pass it in Havana."&#xD;
"The fact is, Mr. Macourty, I am not able to&#xD;
do ~ said Mr. Browsee, ,"my house is not&#xD;
quite paid for yet, there's a thousand dollar&#xD;
n~ortgage on it, and I cannot leave it unpaid&#xD;
for."&#xD;
"I know your building has taken your&#xD;
money," replied his employer, "but leave that&#xD;
to me,"&#xD;
&#xD;
"My mother and sisters-l have no cash to&#xD;
leave with them and-"&#xD;
stAll these objections are easily overcome,&#xD;
said Mr. Maconrty, kindly, but with a manner&#xD;
that settled the question "you can go from&#xD;
here to Havana and from there across the&#xD;
water, to Italy. Wherever you go with&#xD;
our letters of introduction, you will find&#xD;
friends, and our correspondents will cash your&#xD;
checks for whatever money you require, which&#xD;
will be paid at sight here-you need not shake&#xD;
your head, they will not be charged to you,&#xD;
but to expense account, ani your salary I will&#xD;
pay to your mother the same as if you were&#xD;
here-don't say a word, I have thought the&#xD;
matter over well and that's what I say. Why,&#xD;
my fricnd,~you have served me faithfully for&#xD;
years, early and late, hot and cold, you have&#xD;
always been at your desk. I am not one of&#xD;
those who consider a clerk as a machine to be&#xD;
worked as long and as hard as possible and&#xD;
then kickedout? I value your services very&#xD;
highly, but I value you as a man and a friend&#xD;
more than as a clerk, and I am anxious that&#xD;
you should regain your health and be once more&#xD;
strong and hearty."&#xD;
"But the books, Mr. Macourty," said Mr.&#xD;
Browsee, so overwhhlined with his employers&#xD;
kindness that he could scarcely find utterance*&#xD;
for the words.&#xD;
"Philip will have charge of the office," was&#xD;
the reply, "he is young yet, but I think he will&#xD;
get along. I have great confidence in him,&#xD;
he's very steady, and ambitious too."&#xD;
"You are right to feel confidence in him,"&#xD;
said Mr. Browsee, "but he is young for so re-&#xD;
sponsible a position."&#xD;
"Yes, so he is," Mr. Macourty thoughtfully&#xD;
replied, and then added cheerfully, "but that&#xD;
is a fault that will lessen every day. He&#xD;
does very well. I have already given him the&#xD;
power of attorney and he took off th~ last&#xD;
balance sheet without an error, as clean and&#xD;
nice as if you had done it yourself-and I&#xD;
could not say more !"&#xD;
"I am very glad of it, sir," said Mr. Brow-&#xD;
see.&#xD;
"I have advanced his salary to twenty-four&#xD;
~u hundred and he feels greatly elated," contin-&#xD;
ued Mr. Macourty, "and will work hard to&#xD;
bring things up regularly-so you see, we will&#xD;
take care of the business while you are gone,&#xD;
and when you come back you shall have an&#xD;
interest in the house."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Macourty I-really sir, I don't know blo, for the purchasing of it. I tried to manifest&#xD;
how to thank you," replied the clerk,    no anxiety about the matter, and think I sue-&#xD;
"You will please me most by following ~ needed pretty weil, as I gave him only one&#xD;

"I think so," was his deliberating reply,&#xD;

"But it must be as no step-child, Robert," I&#xD;

When the proposition was first made to a&#xD;
&#xD;
MARDI GRAS:&#xD;
&#xD;
Mary she humbly but firmly refused it, Mrs.&#xD;
McDonald was surprised and grieved at this&#xD;
unexpected return for her kindness, but had&#xD;
set her heart so strongly on the projectthat she'&#xD;
ur~ed the child for her reasons, setting forth&#xD;
in glowing colors all the advantages of the&#xD;
home and position she had been offered,&#xD;
"Your offer is one that I will alw4s grate-&#xD;
fully remember," said Mary, while the tears&#xD;
coursed down her cheeks, "and that I would&#xD;
accept if I could."&#xD;
"Tell me why you can not," said Mrs. Mc-&#xD;
Donald, persuasively, "whatever you say shall&#xD;
be confidential,"&#xD;
"I'll leave you to talk it over," said Mr. Mc-&#xD;
Donald, as he arose to leave.&#xD;
"No, sir, if you please," said Mary, "let me&#xD;
say to you both what I have to say, and.Pwill&#xD;
then leave the decision entirely in your&#xD;
hands."&#xD;
With much agitation and often stopping to&#xD;
wipe away the tears that filled' her eyes, and&#xD;
suppressing as much as possible her feelings&#xD;
Mary told her story.&#xD;
"And is that all my child," said Mrs. Mc-&#xD;
Donald, putting her arm around Mary's neck,&#xD;
and kissing her~repeatedly.&#xD;
"I am done, you know all, replied Mary,&#xD;
through her tears.&#xD;
"There is nothing wrong or dishonorable&#xD;
about what you have told us," said Mr. Mc-&#xD;
Donald, himself deeply moved, "nothing for&#xD;
which you are to be blamed, and, in fact it is&#xD;
only an additional reason why you should ac-&#xD;
cept our offer."&#xD;
"Yes, my dear child," said Mrs. McDonald,~&#xD;
caressing her, "you must stay with us. You&#xD;
will find relief from all the cares and anxieties&#xD;
bh~t have oppressed your young life."&#xD;
Their plans for the future were fully discus-&#xD;
ued. Mary was to be their child, to&#xD;
~e known and treated as Mary MeDenald.&#xD;
~fter their cou~sultation was over, Mr. Mc-&#xD;
Jonald called a carriage an~ with Mary pro-&#xD;
~eeded to Mrs. Scraps' to remove Mary's bag-&#xD;
~age. It chanced to be the dinner hour, and&#xD;
n the hall they met Sam Sellwell and Mary&#xD;
introduced him to her new father.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you Mr. Sellwell," said&#xD;
dr. McDonald shaking him cordially by the&#xD;
mud, "your kindness to Mary, whom I hav~~&#xD;
:nown for many years, and have now adopted&#xD;
s my daughter, will never forgotten."&#xD;

"Don't mention it sir," said Sani, hiighly dq-&#xD;
lighted at Mary's good fortune. "I have tried&#xD;
to do a man's duty, and if you remember me,&#xD;
now and' then with kindly feeling I shall be&#xD;
filly repaid."&#xD;
"Remember you! You are a whole-souled,&#xD;
good fellow," replied Mr. McDonald, shaking&#xD;
bands with him again, "I shall be glad to&#xD;
have you call on us at the Astor House and if&#xD;
you ever get down to New Orleans, you will&#xD;
be welcome at my house as long as you choose&#xD;
to stay."&#xD;
Mrs. Scraps was all smiles and politeness,&#xD;
and wished Mary all sorts of good luck, while&#xD;
Sam helped them into the carriage and bid&#xD;
them a cheering good-bye- .&#xD;
The McDonald's remained in the 'cty for two&#xD;
or three weeks, during which time uch addi-&#xD;
tions were made to Mary's wardro e as were&#xD;
required to fit her for the new sphere-in ocie-&#xD;
ty to which she had been called, and her&#xD;
adopted parents soon found that she was or-&#xD;
thys of their highest love and esteem and that&#xD;
in conversation, music, deportment, and al the&#xD;
finer accomplishments of her sex, she w uld&#xD;
reflect credit upon then and became a br ght&#xD;
ornament to the circle in which she w uld&#xD;
move. After they left the Astor House hey&#xD;
went down on the Jersey coast to spend a few&#xD;
months., Mary, although she wrote to Ph'lip,&#xD;
did not mention her new position, any further&#xD;
than to say that she had been very fortunate-&#xD;
"Philip Cummings, New Orleans !" said Mr*&#xD;
McDonald, as he took her first letter 'to rmail&#xD;
it, and with'a sly twinkle in his eyes, turned&#xD;
it over and over, "I did not know you were&#xD;
acquainted with Phil."&#xD;
" Oh! yes, sir," she replied, modestly blush-&#xD;
ing," he was a clerk with Mr. Droll, and spent&#xD;
many of his evenings over with uis."&#xD;
" Ah!I yes-well that's so," he replied, " I re-&#xD;
member h'e told me last winter that he was&#xD;
a dry good's man here. Phil is a promising&#xD;

" Philip deserves his success, sir," she re-&#xD;

" You may well say that," said MrA. McDon-&#xD;
ald, "he is a good man in every respect, a&#xD;
good Catholic and lives up to his religion,&#xD;
which is more than some men can say that I .&#xD;
know."         -a        -    '&#xD;
"Now you needn't be hinting at me," Mr.&#xD;
McDonald, good naturedly replied. "I am&#xD;

" I did not say a word about you, Robert,"&#xD;
said his wife, laughing, " I think you are&#xD;

"And will be a good boy, bye and bye," ho&#xD;
&#xD;
added.&#xD;
" I expect so," she replied.&#xD;
&#xD;
CIIArTgR XXIV.&#xD;
Mr. MacVain had been two months among&#xD;
his train of detectives and followers in New&#xD;
York, looking for traces of the lost child.&#xD;
Williams had made inquiries again and again&#xD;
in every direction, and Bodkers repeated his&#xD;
opinion that "it was a puzzler," and to Mr.'&#xD;
MacVain's offers of reward replied that he&#xD;
could not do more if he was to be made Presi-&#xD;
dent by success. Mr. Emanuel, the pawn&#xD;
broker, gave as little satisfaction in the mat-&#xD;
ter. He was sure he had purchased the cross&#xD;
from a girl, but it was many years ago, how&#xD;
many he could not tell. He thought she was&#xD;
about t welve years old, but she might have&#xD;
been a year of~ two more or less, as he was not&#xD;
a very good judge of people's ages. Her hair&#xD;
-might have been black, but he thought it was&#xD;
brown. It was not unusual for him to buy&#xD;
pieces of family jewelry ;it was an everyday&#xD;
occurrence. His customers comprised all&#xD;
classes. Sometimes they were old and infirm,&#xD;
and seemed ready to part with life, now that&#xD;
theli- keep-sakes and heart-treasures were&#xD;
going; again they were young and the value&#xD;
of friendship and the halo of association had&#xD;
not 'yet been impressed upon their hearts-.&#xD;
Some entered timidly as if dreading the morti-&#xD;
fication of an exposure of their poverty, while&#xD;
others pame with an easy nonchalance showing&#xD;
that they were no strangers to such places.&#xD;
&#xD;
86&#xD;
&#xD;
Some were dressed in the tawdry finery of a&#xD;
,butterfly, that told plainly their character and&#xD;
calling, and it was a strange study to notice&#xD;
with what different emotions these parted&#xD;
with, it might be, the last lingr that connected&#xD;
them with once happy and honorable homes.&#xD;
Others were clad in the simplest dress that&#xD;
innocence and poverty, often refined by the&#xD;
memory of brighter days, could wear. In this&#xD;
crowd of young and old, high and low, modest&#xD;
and 1;razen, making a continual, never ending&#xD;
round of characters, why should he notice&#xD;
one customer more than another If he had&#xD;
known-ah, yes--if he had even suspected&#xD;
that such an interest would have been mani-&#xD;
fested in the girl who quietly accepted his&#xD;
offer and left witpiout particularly attracting&#xD;
his attention, he would have been more care-&#xD;
ful in noting her looks and actions.&#xD;
Disappointed in his hopes of getting at least&#xD;
one defliiite point to start from, Mr. MacVain&#xD;
resolved to quit the city for a time and visit&#xD;
some of the fashionable resorts, so numerous&#xD;
around, and convenient to, the great city.&#xD;
At Long Branch he found a large crowd of&#xD;
visitors, many of whom he knew, and here they&#xD;
all seemed devoted to a continual series of&#xD;
pleasures. Tired of chatting, music and&#xD;
dancing, he started one morning 'early for a&#xD;
-walk through the country. Through lanes,&#xD;
over.pa'stures and beneath the shade of forests,&#xD;
he strolled on, not minding where his wander-&#xD;
ing would lead him. He came at last to the'&#xD;
banks of a basin or inland bay, back of the&#xD;
long, sterile strip called Sandy Hook, and the&#xD;
placid look of the water pleased him well. A&#xD;
boatman in a small skiff was just preparing to&#xD;
leave the shore and he asked him where he was&#xD;
going.&#xD;
"To Little Silver," the man replied, pointing&#xD;
to the opposite shore. " Do you wish to go&#xD;
over I"&#xD;
Feeling in a mood for adventure, Mr. Mac-,&#xD;
Vain answered in the affirmative, and, seating&#xD;
himself in the boat, was soon gliding over the&#xD;
mirror-like surface of the water, which was so&#xD;
clear and placid that the pebbly bottom could&#xD;
often be seen. Rounding the point, the boat&#xD;
shot up idto Little Silver creek, a small run-&#xD;
ning stream, on the banks of which were&#xD;
several fine residences, groves of fruit trees, 8&#xD;
lands and lawns with large shade trees, and in&#xD;
the distance, fields of luxuriant gi-ain. C&#xD;
Passing from the grassy bank of the creek to ~&#xD;
&#xD;
the main road, a broad, old, country road, Mr,&#xD;
MacVain walked on beyond the few houses on&#xD;
the point and was once more getting into tha&#xD;
open country, when he observed the approach&#xD;
of a lady, and slackened his pace that he might&#xD;
observe her as she passed. She was young,&#xD;
near the age so often~ sung about "sweet six-&#xD;
teen," her form was perfect, tall,.dignified and&#xD;
queen-like, with such a walk and manner as&#xD;
might have graced the kingly courts of the&#xD;
days of "belted knights and fair ladies." The&#xD;
expression of her face was a happy blending of&#xD;
firmness and decisive character, with purity&#xD;
and child-like innocence; her mouth -was&#xD;
small, with rosy lips firmly closed; her eyes&#xD;
were large, and of that blue which, in medita-&#xD;
tion or calm repose, look dreamy and melting,&#xD;
yet when aroused to feeling and under excite-&#xD;
ment, sparkle with a brilliant and dazzling&#xD;
light. The bloom of her complexion would&#xD;
rival the first blush of rosy morn, falling upon-&#xD;
the velvety softness of the mellow peach, and&#xD;
around her presence there wa4 an air of re-&#xD;
finement, cultivation and worth, which capti-&#xD;
vated the admiration and respect of all behold-&#xD;
ers.&#xD;
As she passed he stood spell-bound as in a&#xD;
dream, while thp bright vision of some youth-&#xD;
'ful fancy was realized in her. He waited a&#xD;
while and then followed at such a distance as&#xD;
not to attract her notice. At a distance, as he&#xD;
again approached the few dwellings on the&#xD;
point, he saw a. gentleman coming-towards&#xD;
him, and, as he joined the lady, MacVain&#xD;
recognized his old friend, Mr. Robert McDon-&#xD;
aid, and, quickening his steps, he soon came&#xD;
up with them.&#xD;
" Why, how are you, my dear Percy, I am&#xD;
glad to see you '? exclairlied Mr. McDonald,&#xD;
topping in his walk.&#xD;
" Well, very well, thank yen," answered Mr-&#xD;
MIacVain, casting and inquiring look on the&#xD;
Lady.&#xD;
"My daughter, Mary," said Mr. McDonald,&#xD;
noticing his friend's look. "Mary, this is my&#xD;
friend, Mr. MacVain, of New Orleans."&#xD;
" I am proud-to meet you, Miss McDonald,"&#xD;
said Percy, with a puzzled air, as if he did not&#xD;
know what it meant.&#xD;
"As a friend of my father's I am pleased to&#xD;
ee you," Mary replied, with dignity andgrace.&#xD;
They conversed pleasantly until they reached&#xD;
ne ogf the houses on the side of the road,&#xD;
when Mr. McDonald said: "Here is where wer&#xD;

are staying. Mary and my wife preferred ~'&#xD;
quiet country house to a fashionable resort.&#xD;
Come in and see my wife; she will be very&#xD;
glad to see you."&#xD;
Mrs. McDonald welcomed Mr. MacVain in a&#xD;
friendly manner, and some time was spent in&#xD;
conversation, after which they had dinner,&#xD;
ai~d then, going to ~the parlor, Mary played for&#xD;
thorn some of the most popular music of the&#xD;
day, varied, by request, with some of the old,&#xD;
familiar melodies, the popularity of which&#xD;
~bids fair to last through all time.&#xD;
An excursion was then propmcd, and, pro-&#xD;
curing a line, large boat, th~y took a sail down&#xD;
'~h~ creek, around the bay and back to the&#xD;
wharf again, ais4ving just in time to hear the&#xD;
~estio old bell clatter out the summons to sup-&#xD;
per.&#xD;
"By Jove, Mac," said Mr. MacVain, "I like&#xD;
your quiet retreat so well that, if I thought it&#xD;
i~ossible to get a room, I would come' over and&#xD;
s~ay a few days."&#xD;
"That's a capital idea," replied Mr. McDon-&#xD;
ald, much pleased. "Old Mr. Binger can give&#xD;
you a room, I am sure, and if you come over&#xD;
we'll have a jolly time."&#xD;
Mr. Binger, the landlord, was consulted, and&#xD;
a room was assigned to Mr. MacVain. A car-&#xD;
riage was then furnished in which he returned&#xD;
to Long Branch, and, having settled his ac-&#xD;
count there, he appeared, early next morning,&#xD;
among his friends at Little Silves."&#xD;
"Come Percy, we are going crabbing," said&#xD;
Mi~. McDonald, as he appeared on the porch of&#xD;
the house, a great straw hat on his head, and a&#xD;
long pole, with a net at the end, over his&#xD;
shoulder. The ladies appeared in sea shore&#xD;
hats) and the company went down on the&#xD;
wharf. Tl~e net was handed over to Mr. Mac-&#xD;
Vain, with . instructions that, when the crabs&#xD;
caught the bait, he should slip the net under&#xD;
and bring them up, which kept him busy, as&#xD;
there were three lines out and the crabs&#xD;
were not slow at biting. At first he was a&#xD;
little awkward. Once, while catching for&#xD;
Mary, he came near falling into the water and&#xD;
taking her in with him. He soon became, how-&#xD;
ever, as expert at this and the other sports of&#xD;
the place as any of the visitors, of whom there&#xD;
were some forty or fifty at Mr. Linger's. Days&#xD;
aud weeks rolled ou in this secluded. spots&#xD;
where all followed the bent of their own&#xD;
i~nclinations. Now fishing, bathing or boating&#xD;
oa the creek or bay, at other times riding&#xD;
&#xD;
though the country, the scenery of which was&#xD;
interesting and beautiful, and at times these&#xD;
rides~ would extend to Long Branch. Here Mr.&#xD;
MacVain asd the McDonalds met many of&#xD;
their friends from the South, to whom Mary&#xD;
was always presented as the daughter of the&#xD;
latter, and many pleasant dinner parties and&#xD;
excursions resulted from these visits. One of&#xD;
Mr. McDonald's favorite trips was to cross the&#xD;
creek in their boats, taking with them a good&#xD;
lunch, and to ramble off into the pleasant&#xD;
woods until tired, when the servants would&#xD;
bring up the refreshments, which they would&#xD;
arrange on the ground. Then, seated beneath&#xD;
the grand old trees, the party would spend an&#xD;
hour or two in pleasant conversation, relating&#xD;
quaint or amusing stories, at which Mr. Mac-&#xD;
Vain had a happy and telling manner. He&#xD;
would often join Mary in singing some song or&#xD;
favorite melody, making the forest iing with&#xD;
the music of their voices. In the evening they&#xD;
would take a sail; or stroll through the gar-&#xD;
dens, or, remaining in the house, the time&#xD;
would pass rapidly away while they amused&#xD;
themselves at whist or euchre, or joining with&#xD;
other parties in the house,, dancing, 'music and&#xD;
conversation would soon fill up the hours.&#xD;
In the pleasures of the present Mr. MacVain&#xD;
had buried the cares, anxiety and remorse of&#xD;
the past; and in the enjoyment of the society&#xD;
of his friends, for the time, at least, the dis-&#xD;
appointments of his long and fruitless search&#xD;
for the lost child were forgotten.&#xD;
A new existence had dawned upon him, and&#xD;
it seemed as if the spring-time of life had re-&#xD;
turned, shedding its rosy hues on all that he&#xD;
saw. He was Mary's constant companion and&#xD;
joined with sympathy in her every mood, sang,&#xD;
laughed, danced and played, or with medita-&#xD;
tive air promenaded the shady lawns, oi~ sat in&#xD;
their - boat listlessly beneath the tranquil&#xD;
light of the moon on the silvery waters,&#xD;
drinking in the melody of her voice as she&#xD;
discoursed of religion, science and literature,&#xD;
~r of departed friends, or as, with depth&#xD;
of feeling she, in harmonious tones, breathed&#xD;
forth in song some devotion to the IMessed&#xD;
Mother, or with enthusiasm awakened the&#xD;
echoes of wood and shore with the full melody&#xD;
of the grand anthems of the Holy Church.&#xD;
As he watched her 'in these varying moods,&#xD;
it seemed as if, going back through the dim&#xD;
vista of departed-aye, lost-.years, he once&#xD;
&#xD;
more stood within the halo of his youthfu&#xD;
days; the simple chapel, where, by his mother'i&#xD;
knee, he had so often knelt in devotion; tha'&#xD;
fond mother's smiles and caresses; her prayer&#xD;
for her often hoadstring boy, the only hop&#xD;
and consolation of her life; all came back t(&#xD;
him, and he longed once more to feel th~&#xD;
soothing influence of that religion, which ha~&#xD;
been his guide and coi~solation in those youth&#xD;
ful days. When his mind returned once mor&#xD;
and he looked into Mary's blue eyes, so full o&#xD;
depth and ethereal beauty, or flashing bright&#xD;
with mirth or soul-stirring feeling, when h(&#xD;
looked upon her clear, fine forehead, he&#xD;
rounded, dimpled chin and her mouth small&#xD;
lull and beautifully formed, he thought of th&#xD;
love his heart had known so many years be-&#xD;
fore, and wondered if it was indeed warming&#xD;
again to a new, and, he thought, not less&#xD;
worthy object. He had proposed to stay for a&#xD;
few days at Little Silver, but the days&#xD;
lengthened into weeks, and he still remained,&#xD;
often proposing to go "next Monday" or&#xD;
"Wednesday" but always allowing some new&#xD;
excursion to defer his departure.&#xD;
Servant's are shrewd observers of the ac-&#xD;
tions and motives of their employers, and in&#xD;
this the old time negro servants were equal to&#xD;
any that ever were "in service." With the Mc-&#xD;
Donald's there were three colored servants,&#xD;
John, a likely boy, of forty years, or thereabouts,&#xD;
who attended to the baggage when-they were&#xD;
traveling andzacted as a general body-servant;&#xD;
Linda, some five or six years his junior, great&#xD;
talker, and Sarah, a young girl, about sixteen&#xD;
years of age, who had especially attached her-&#xD;
self to Miss Mary," or "young missus2' These&#xD;
were all negroes . of the blackest type, and&#xD;
possessed that pride, superstition and rever-&#xD;
ence for "master's family," which characterizes&#xD;
the real negro. ~&#xD;
~ God, I b'leve Mis'r MacVain are in&#xD;
love with young missus," said Aunt Linda, as&#xD;
the three sat together in front of the kitchen.&#xD;
"Him! you tink young missus look at him I"&#xD;
said Sarah.&#xD;
"Why not? he's a nice gentl'm ain't he I"&#xD;
inquired John.&#xD;
Why,. he's done bin old 'nuf to be her fad-&#xD;
~ said Sarah.&#xD;
"I ain't a gwinu te say dat young missus&#xD;
tink of him," said Aunt Linda, emphasizing&#xD;
her views by gestures with her arms and nod-&#xD;
&#xD;
1 ding of her head, "1 dunno bout dat, but I&#xD;
tell you what, he tiuk a heap o' her. I dun&#xD;
see ~ fur dat."&#xD;
"He's berry perlite, as a gen'l'm ought be,&#xD;
but I dunno 'bout-" said Sarah.&#xD;
"Don't tell me; ain't I seen white folks 'nuf&#xD;
to know I" said Linda. "Can't I see? I know&#xD;
dat he tinks heap ob her-ebbery whare she&#xD;
- goes dar you. sure to see him, and de 'ten-&#xD;
sions what he pays her, it's just 'nuf to make&#xD;
it plain dat he lubs her shua !"&#xD;
' I say he's too ole," said Sarah, with a toss&#xD;
of her head.&#xD;
"He ain't so berry ole, neifer," John an-&#xD;
swered. "He's a rite young man, an' a mitey&#xD;
han'som one, too, an' he's got plenty money 1"&#xD;
*   "What's young missus want nv munney?&#xD;
Ain't massa got heaps ob it I" replied Sarah,&#xD;
indignantly. "What you tink she care ~&#xD;
niunney', when inassa an' missus bofe dun&#xD;
tole her dat wot's theirs is hem? A ba'(cl&#xD;
young angel like her ought to ~et a nice young&#xD;
man when she marries."&#xD;
They continued their discussion until called&#xD;
to serve those to\ whom they were attached.&#xD;
Linda thought Mr. MacVain was in love with&#xD;
Mary. John, who had been favorably ioi-&#xD;
pressed by sundry quarters and half ~ll.r&#xD;
pieces from Mr. MacVain, thought tkat it&#xD;
would be a very good match for Mary; while&#xD;
Sarah, as the one nearest to Mary, thought he&#xD;
was too old and indignantly denied all proha-&#xD;
bility of such an event.&#xD;
When Mr. McDonald ordered the trunks&#xD;
packed for a trip, as he said, to show Mary&#xD;
something of the world, Mr. MeVain became&#xD;
one of the traveling party. They visited St.&#xD;
Catherine's Wells, Montreal, Niagara and Sara-&#xD;
toga, viewing the novelties and curiosities ef&#xD;
these well known summer resorts, and enjoy-&#xD;
ing the change of scenery and the gay society&#xD;
found at them. One morning after their return&#xD;
to the Astor House, Mr. McDonald having&#xD;
nearly completed his arrangements to go home,&#xD;
met Mr. MacVain, who requested him, to go&#xD;
into the reading room to hold a few moment&#xD;
conversation in private.&#xD;
"You are going home soon ?" inquired Mr.&#xD;
MacVain.&#xD;
"The first of next week," replied his friend,&#xD;
wondering what was coming.&#xD;
"Miss Mary will go with you I"&#xD;
"Certainly, for although, as you know, she&#xD;
is an orphan, I have adopted her as my daugh.&#xD;

ter, and as such I wish her to feel and ac, said&#xD;
Mr. McDonald. " When I get home I shall com-&#xD;
plete the adoption according to law, and those&#xD;
who wish to be my friends must know and re-&#xD;
ceive her as my daughter."&#xD;
"I have your permission to 'visit her when&#xD;
you get home ?"&#xD;
" Why, Percy, -what a question I of course&#xD;
you have."&#xD;
"lBut, you do not understand me," replied&#xD;
Mr. MacVain, "I wish to become a suitor for&#xD;
her hand." .&#xD;
" This is a subject on which I would tolerate&#xD;
no trifling."&#xD;
" Trifling! I never was more serious in my&#xD;
life," said Mr. MacVain,."I1 ive your daughter&#xD;
sincerely and would ipake he~ my wife."&#xD;
" Humph, Percy, you are too old for such a&#xD;
young girl."&#xD;
" I am not too old to love sincerely;" replied&#xD;
Mr. MacVain, in a calm, dignified tone. " I'&#xD;
can honor and protect her, arid if I am a little&#xD;
old, my feelings are but the deeper and more&#xD;
unchangeable."&#xD;
"Well, 'pen my honor, I ever thought of&#xD;
that before," said Mr. McDon ld, " but it may&#xD;
be for the best. You are one of my most inti-&#xD;
mnate friends, and I have always esteemed you&#xD;
highly, Percy, so I will say that if you can win&#xD;
her you may have her-but her will is to be&#xD;
perfectly free-, her actions and choice unfet-&#xD;

"I have your consent to try i" inquired Mr.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV'.-&#xD;
The absence of Mr. Browsee, who was look-&#xD;
ing for health in foreign countries, brought&#xD;
Philip prominently forward, and he soon be-&#xD;
came well known amongst the merchants and&#xD;
business men of the city. The cofidence re-&#xD;
posed in him by one so well known and highly&#xD;
respected as Mr. Macourty, gave him at once&#xD;
a standing and weight in the community.. He&#xD;
was soon a favorite with the young men who&#xD;
approximated his own age, and amongst them.&#xD;
&#xD;
90&#xD;
&#xD;
they formed a circle, where plans for mutual&#xD;
amusement were brought up and carried out.&#xD;
His especial favorites were William Malureath,&#xD;
the favorite clerk of one of the private bank-&#xD;
ing houses of the city; Louis rontane, the son&#xD;
of a wealthy broker, and Carl Amber, whose&#xD;
father was a prominent cotton-factor, and with&#xD;
these there were some ten or fifteen others all&#xD;
regarded as -the most promising young metn of&#xD;
the city. They went in a crowd and were al-&#xD;
most inseperable; they broke the chrysalis of&#xD;
youth and took the airs and manners of men&#xD;
at about the same time. At first the pleasure&#xD;
of a good havana cigar, a stroll through Jack-&#xD;
son Square on Sunday evening, a game of&#xD;
billiards or ten-pins, with an occasional visit&#xD;
to the lake, made up the sum~ of their indul-&#xD;
gences, but as one ventured a little further. on&#xD;
in the road of pleasure and dissipation, the&#xD;
others soon came up to and passedhis standard, 7&#xD;
until they were known as a "fast crowd," at all&#xD;
the saloons, livery stables and public places of&#xD;
the city. Philip became lukewarm in attend-&#xD;
ance at church, dodged in and heard a low mass&#xD;
or heard none at all, called less frequently at&#xD;
Mrs. Macourty's and made shorter visits, and&#xD;
.avoided speaking about the manner in which&#xD;
spent his time. Mr. Macourty mentioned&#xD;
to his wife his fear that Philip was going&#xD;
astray, but she looked upon Philip as a sbn,&#xD;
and, with the confidence and love of a mother,&#xD;
would credit no report of the kind. In May&#xD;
the family went as usual to Biloxi, and Philip&#xD;
was left to himself; not only as to the eccupa-&#xD;
tion of his leisure time, but also in the man-&#xD;
agement of the business, Mr. Macourty return-&#xD;
ing to the city for a day or two, now and then,&#xD;
just to see that everything went right. Du-&#xD;
ring this summer the, young men formed the&#xD;
Crescent Dramatic Club, with rooms on Ca-&#xD;
rondelet street, and here games of cards and&#xD;
chess, with a varied assortment of reading&#xD;
matter, were provided. It was a copy on a&#xD;
small scale and in modest style of the Pelican,&#xD;
Commercial and Delta Clubs, established by .&#xD;
their seniors. Philiphadcorrespondedregularly&#xD;
with Mary, but in the fall, just after Mr. Ma-&#xD;
courty's family returned to the city, he was&#xD;
surprised to receive a letter from her request-&#xD;
ing hian not to write any more until he heard&#xD;
from her again. What could this mean Had&#xD;
the news of his dissipation reached heri He&#xD;
half feared that it had, but resolved to wait&#xD;
and see when she would break the silence'.&#xD;

About a month afterwards he went to Mr&#xD;
Macourty's to spend the evening and was r&#xD;
ceived by Mrs. Macourty in the same kind an&#xD;
friendly manner, as had always been her en&#xD;
tom. No allusion was made to the change&#xD;
his conduct, because~ she believed that if hi&#xD;
was really going astray, he would be reclaime&#xD;
sooner by kindness than by having his fault&#xD;
continually spoken of. The children were ou&#xD;
visiting at Mrs. Cheerful's when he arrived&#xD;
but soon came in.&#xD;
" Well, how is Mrs. Cheerful ?" said Mrs. Ma&#xD;
courty, after the salutations of meeting ha&#xD;
passed. .&#xD;
" Oh! she is well and all of the children&#xD;
too," replied Annie, in a joyous manner, " an&#xD;
Mrs. McDonald's home, we stopped there as w&#xD;
were coming back."&#xD;
" I am glad to hear she is back,'' replied herm&#xD;
mother. " How is she ?"&#xD;
"She is very well," said Annie, "and you&#xD;
ought to see her daughter!"&#xD;
" Her daughter ?" exclaimed Mrs. Macourty,&#xD;
" Yes, ma, her daughter," replied Annie,&#xD;
" Mary McDonla. Oh ! she is' the sweetest&#xD;
girl you ever saw, so winninng in her manner,&#xD;
so good natured. I declare I loved her the&#xD;
moment I saw her." ,&#xD;
" Well, Annie, you are an enthusiast any-&#xD;
how," replied her mother.&#xD;
" Ask them if I am not right," said Annie,&#xD;
pointing to the other children. -&#xD;
" She is really a beautiful young lady," re-&#xD;
plrie George, " and worthy of all Annie's&#xD;
praise--..&#xD;
" A young lady," said Philip, " I did not&#xD;
know Mrs. McDonald had a daughter.n"&#xD;
"She has long been talking of adopting a&#xD;
child," replied Mrs. Macourty, "and I pre-&#xD;
sume this is some one she has taken in that&#xD;
way."&#xD;
"She has made a splendid choice," said&#xD;
George. :&#xD;
S"Indeed, she has," said Annie, her eyes&#xD;
sparkling with delight, "she is worthy of&#xD;
being anybody's daughter-you ought to hear&#xD;
her sing!"&#xD;
"I shall certainly go down and see this&#xD;
prodigy," replied her mother.&#xD;
" Who is that ?" asked Cecelia, just then&#xD;
coming in.&#xD;
"Mrs. McDonald's daughter," answered An-&#xD;
nie.&#xD;
&#xD;
s.   " Didn't know she had a daughter," replied&#xD;
e- Cecelia, carelessly.&#xD;
d " She has probably adopted her as such,"&#xD;
s- said Mrs. Macourty,&#xD;
n "I don't see what she wanted to do that for,"&#xD;
e replied Cecelia. "It's strange what luck in&#xD;
d getting homeslsome gutter rats have."&#xD;
;s "Fie, fie, Cecelia, you should not speak so,"&#xD;
*t said Mrs. Macourty.&#xD;
," Come down with us to see her to-morrow&#xD;
evening," said Annie, " and you will think as&#xD;
-I do."&#xD;
d" I don't want to go. These folks that are&#xD;
picked up from nothing and suddenly get into&#xD;
,good positions put on too many airs for me."&#xD;
d" You have not seen' her; wait till you have&#xD;
before you judge so harshly," said Mrs. Ma-&#xD;
courty.&#xD;
" I don't want to see her," and Cecelin&#xD;
seated herself at the piano and began totturn&#xD;
over some music.&#xD;
" Mrs. McDonald told me to ask you, pa and&#xD;
Cecelia to come down to-morrow evening,"&#xD;
said Annie to her mother, " will you go ?"&#xD;
" Yes, my dear," said her mother, "and we&#xD;
will tax Philip's time to come and go with us."&#xD;
Philip would rather have been excused, but&#xD;
considered it good poic toacp -h ivt-&#xD;
tion, and on the following acceningthe wnt&#xD;
with them to Mrs. McDonald's house. The&#xD;
parlors were well lighted and several friends&#xD;
of the family had called in to see them after&#xD;
their summer tour. Mrs. McDonald and Mrs.1&#xD;
Macourty hving brens schoolmatre were&#xD;
was now most cordial. Mr. MacVain was also&#xD;
present and the children were especially de-&#xD;
lghted to see him.&#xD;
"Come up stairs," said Mrs. McDonald to&#xD;
her old friend, ."I want to introduce you to my&#xD;
daughter."&#xD;
"I shall be pleased to see her," replied Mrs.&#xD;
Macourty. '" Phe'children have done nothing&#xD;
but praise her since they were here."&#xD;
As they started to go out, the door opened&#xD;
and Mary entered, and with a graceful, self-&#xD;
possessed manner advanced to meet them.&#xD;
"I am happy to meet you, daughter," said&#xD;
Mrs. Macourty, as she gave Mary a loving kiss.&#xD;
"I have heard good reports about you from my&#xD;
children, and I am sure you are deserving of&#xD;
them."&#xD;
" Thank you, thank you," replied Mary,&#xD;

warmly returning the salutation. "I hope&#xD;
that we shall always be gqod friends."&#xD;
Philip, whose astonishment at finding Mary&#xD;
50 unexpectedly was very, great, now came foi -&#xD;
ward.&#xD;
"I hardly know whether to greet you as&#xD;
Mary," he said, in a voice scarcely audible&#xD;
from the emotions struggling within him, " or&#xD;
to bow to a ne\v acquaintance in Miss McDon-&#xD;
ald."&#xD;
" Between old friends, Philip," she replied,&#xD;
extending her hand with a pleased look, "nevi&#xD;
circumstances need bring no cold formalities."&#xD;
Mr. MacVain, who had been surprised by the&#xD;
recognition between Mary and Philip, watched'&#xD;
them attentively, as they were together often&#xD;
during the evening, and the iook of tranquil&#xD;
happiness, or merry, joyous pleasure that shone&#xD;
at ties on Mary's face, as Philip, in his best&#xD;
mnood, chatted of the fashions, related anec-&#xD;
dotes, criti'cised the new books and plays, or&#xD;
joined in Pie song or dance, as he looked upon&#xD;
her during these changes he feared that hehad&#xD;
discovered in Philip a formidable rival. Mr.&#xD;
Macourty came later, and with him' Mr. Mc-&#xD;
Donald, and the evening pas d pleasantly -to&#xD;
all.                          -   '&#xD;
" I was glad to see Philip there," said Mr.&#xD;
Macourty t his wife, after they had returned&#xD;
home.   '/           ,&#xD;
" It seems they are ol friends," replied his&#xD;
wife. " Mrs. McDonald says they have cor-&#xD;
responded ever since Philip came here."&#xD;
"She is a charming girl," said Mr. Macourty,&#xD;
" my heart warmed to her the megnent I saw&#xD;
her.",.&#xD;
"And mine ! I never met any one with whom&#xD;
I was so well pleased."&#xD;
"I trust that she will have a good influence&#xD;
on Philip," said Mr. Macourtg, " and win him&#xD;
back from the fast crowd he has fallen in with."&#xD;
"I don't-think Philip is very wild," said his&#xD;
wife, while the anxious tone, of her voice told&#xD;
that she feared he was.&#xD;
" He has been going it pretty loose," was the&#xD;
reply. ," His .salary is drawn nearly a month&#xD;
ahead, and there are unmistakable signs that&#xD;
he is going the road to ruin."&#xD;
" I hope that it is not so bad as you thnk"&#xD;
replied Mrs. Macourty.&#xD;
Philip was pleased to find Mary grown so&#xD;
much and for a time was very attentive to her,&#xD;
but thie influence of the club and an imagined&#xD;
change in her manner to him worked upon his I&#xD;
&#xD;
mind until he became almost a stranger at&#xD;
Mr. McDonald's. One evening as he entered&#xD;
the Crescent Club, carelessly sauntering in&#xD;
smoking a cigar, he heard some of the mem-&#xD;
bers talking of Mary and praising her earnest-&#xD;
ly. The universal favor in which she was re-&#xD;
ceived created a feeling of jealousy with him.&#xD;
If he had met her in poverty, struggling to&#xD;
maintain herself, he 'Would have rushed to her&#xD;
assistance and would have made any sacrifice&#xD;
for her. He found her now surrounded by&#xD;
every comfort, in the midst of'elegance and&#xD;
refinement, with friends who were deeply de-&#xD;
voted to her and hosts of admirers ever ready&#xD;
to flatter and praise, and having looked'for-.&#xD;
ward to their meeting with the hope that he ,&#xD;
would then guide her actions and monopo-&#xD;
lise her society, he became sensitive of every&#xD;
1ook and word.&#xD;
9ne of the visitors of, the Club was Col.&#xD;
Sp des, who, having received an invitation&#xD;
frou one of the inembers to call at the rooms&#xD;
didl so and continued hie visits regularly, not&#xD;
an evening passing without his spending a&#xD;
par i of it there. He was not long in starting&#xD;
parties in games of cards at which the betting&#xD;
was often very large, and through which he&#xD;
always passed largely the winner. He man-&#xD;
age~l his points well, flattering the members&#xD;
ang paying deference to their judgment, so&#xD;
that he was soon a favorite with the whole&#xD;
Club. His bland and affable manner, gentle-&#xD;
manly bearing and handsome dress, with a&#xD;
continual talk about his horses, plantation and&#xD;
negroes, his money in bank and estates on the&#xD;
Hudson, all of which were dwelt upon and yet&#xD;
in a manner .that avoided the appearance of&#xD;
boasting, made a deep impression on Phillp,&#xD;
and, as the Colonel was particularly friendly&#xD;
to him, the card parties were seldom made up&#xD;
without himn.&#xD;
When Philip was-short of money in settling,&#xD;
his losses, the Colonel accepted his note,, de-&#xD;
claring with marked politeness that it made&#xD;
uo difference, any other time would do.&#xD;
At last the season closed and the Colonel an-&#xD;
nounced in the Club that he was going to see&#xD;
about his estates in the North, collect his divi-&#xD;
dends in New York, and see the world at the,&#xD;
fashionable resorts, and the news was received&#xD;
with much regret by the members, who were&#xD;
sorry to loose the gallant Colonel.&#xD;
It required some financeering on'Philip's part&#xD;
to raise the six or eight hundred dollars that&#xD;

and there the baskets were deposited. Mr.&#xD;
Cheerful gave Angello some money and asked&#xD;
him to get some ice for their party, and on the&#xD;
next train it came do wn from the City.&#xD;
In a short time the whole crowd were out on&#xD;
the wharf fishing for crabs, and great was the&#xD;
delight when little Susan shouted, "Come here&#xD;
quick, Papa, Philip come here, I got one," and&#xD;
she had; it was about the size of the now&#xD;
strange and antique coin, then commonly used&#xD;
as a half dollar. Dick laughed and said it made&#xD;
no difference, big or little the children enjoyed&#xD;
the sport. Every hour a train came down&#xD;
from the city, and then they would stop to see&#xD;
the crowds that came to take the boats for&#xD;
Mobile or the lake coast, or who came, like&#xD;
themselves, to enjoy the fresh air and the ride.&#xD;
About noon Mr. Cheerful called them in and a&#xD;
lunch of crakers, cake and cheese, with some&#xD;
wine, was partaken of, and a supply handed&#xD;
over to Samson and the colored girls. After&#xD;
this they strolled out to the end of the long&#xD;
wharf, 'Where, under the shade of the roof, put&#xD;
on to protect freight, they spent an hour fish-&#xD;
ing for croakers and red fish. A gentleman a&#xD;
little nearer the end of the wharf, was having&#xD;
splendid success, drawing the fish in at the&#xD;
rate of twenty-five or thirty an hour. Edward&#xD;
and Charley were jealous of the stranger's&#xD;
success, for nothing but provoking bites and&#xD;
nibbles rewarded their exertions. .-&#xD;
"Come, let us go bathe," said Mr. Cheerful,&#xD;
this is fun but it lacks variety." The bath&#xD;
refreshed them very much, the water was low I&#xD;
and the 'children romped and played in it,&#xD;
shouting to their hearts' content. It&#xD;
was then about two o'clock and the servants&#xD;
took one of Angello's tables and aritanged the 1&#xD;
dinner. What appetites the children had ! I&#xD;
And the older members of the party, were I&#xD;
able to pay flattering attentions to the pro-&#xD;
visions! The claret was very fine, and the I&#xD;
corks of the fat bottles flew out with reports&#xD;
like pistols, the pies were excellent and the&#xD;
cake was perfection. After the dinner, the ~&#xD;

formed another expedition 'against the crabs,&#xD;
and Mrs. Cheerful took a seat in the shade '&#xD;
near them. Dick lighted his cigar and taking ~&#xD;
a seat where the cool breeze blew upon him,&#xD;
raised his feet on 'another chair, spread the d&#xD;
paper out for a quiet read and was soon&#xD;
asleep. Philip asked Mary to walk out on the ~&#xD;
wharf, and~ they stopped a while to see the n&#xD;
&#xD;
Mobile boat get in the last freight, and depart&#xD;
on her voyage across the lake. Passing on to&#xD;
the head of the pier, they took seats and&#xD;
watched the waves as they rolled slowly in,&#xD;
pouring over the break water in the distance.&#xD;
" This does not look much like New York&#xD;
Bay," said Philip.&#xD;
"No," replied Mary, "it looks more like Lit-&#xD;
tle Silver Bay."&#xD;
"Are you going to spend the summer there?"&#xD;
asked Philip.&#xD;
;" I do not know," she answered, " but it is&#xD;
probable that we will be there at least a part&#xD;
"of the time."&#xD;
*"May I write to you, Mary 1" he asked.&#xD;
" Your letters are always welcome," she an-&#xD;
swered.&#xD;
" I have been wishing, Mary," he said, ,with&#xD;
hesitation "to speak with you privately--there&#xD;
was a time, when we were children together,&#xD;
Mary, that I could talk with you freely, but'&#xD;
there seems to have come a strangeness, a re-&#xD;
served manner that forbids me to speak.'t&#xD;
" I am sure, Philip," she replied, with much&#xD;
candor, " that I do not know what has made&#xD;
yen think so. It is true you have not been&#xD;
very frequentlyrat our house, but I presumed&#xD;
it was because you had found better company."&#xD;
" Better company," he exclaimed, " you&#xD;
know I could not think that."&#xD;
" Nay, then your actions have said it," she&#xD;
replied, with dignity, " I always treated you&#xD;
as a friend, but-perhaps you remember the,&#xD;
poor apple girl and feel it too much of a condes-&#xD;
cension to visit her."&#xD;
"How can you say that, Mary 1" he asked.&#xD;
" If it was not so, she replied, with 'some&#xD;
bitterness, " how was it that you, the only&#xD;
Person in the city acquainted with me at that&#xD;
time, have been such a stranger at our house?"&#xD;
" I wish that I had been more attentive," he.&#xD;
eplied.&#xD;
" Don't think that I would have you forego&#xD;
ther pleasures to call on me," she said, in the&#xD;
ame cold tone of voice, "I merely thought it&#xD;
trange that one who was such an old acquaint-&#xD;
~nce, and pretended to be so strong in friend-&#xD;
hip, should leave me almost entirely to stran-&#xD;
crs. It has chanced that they were more thair&#xD;
:ind, they were nil that I could ask-yet you&#xD;
id not know that."&#xD;
"Maryi my dear Mary I" he exclaimed, " I&#xD;
~as wrong-I thought, that surrounded with'&#xD;
ew friends you did not care for my atten-&#xD;

tions, that I was not wanted and so I remained&#xD;
away. But my heart was with you, Mary, for&#xD;
since I first saw your sweet face, and knew&#xD;
your mn dest, virtuous, noble disposition, since&#xD;
I first daw those bright eyes 'and heard the&#xD;
melody' of your voice, since then, Mary, no&#xD;
matter where I have been, far and near, with&#xD;
one constant feeling, my heart has been yours,&#xD;
a true, devoted offering, ready to do all and&#xD;
dare all for your sake."&#xD;
She was silent, and after a pause he con-&#xD;
tinued,.&#xD;
" Tell me, Mary, do you love me I"&#xD;
"'We have been friends, Philip, but I fear&#xD;
we can never be more than friendsY'&#xD;
"Why, Mary, oh! tell me why 1" he ex-&#xD;
claimed, pleadingly, "I love you with all my&#xD;
heart, then tell me, will you be my wife I"&#xD;
"I cannot answer now," she said, restrain-&#xD;
ing her feelings'.&#xD;
"Mary this is no new feeling," he replied',&#xD;
drawing- still nearer to her, and speaking&#xD;
earnestly, "it came without my bidding, grew&#xD;
in my heart, and day by day became-stronger.&#xD;
At. first I did not recognize its meaning, I&#xD;
thought it friendship, but as it became deeper'&#xD;
I felt that it waslove, true, enduring love, and&#xD;
now, 'without you I shall be forever lost. Say&#xD;
that you love me Mary, or that I may yet hope&#xD;
to win your -love and claim your heart and&#xD;
hand."&#xD;
" Philip, I cannot now ilnswer you," she&#xD;
said, avoiding his look, "there is a deference&#xD;
due Mr. McDonald, who has been like a kind&#xD;
-father to me, and he must first be consulted',&#xD;
but should he give his consent, I could not&#xD;
marry one who has forsaken his God and reli-&#xD;
gion for the wine-cup and gaming table."&#xD;
I~f he had been struck by a bolt from Heaven,&#xD;
Philip would have niot been more .surprised'.&#xD;
For a moment he sat pale and speechless, then&#xD;
the hot bWood rushed to his face and brow, and&#xD;
he staited up flushed and angry. As their&#xD;
looks met, there was in her face firm, high re-&#xD;
solve expressed, that conquered his feelings&#xD;
and he sat down beside her again-.&#xD;
" Am I going to destruction 7" he asked in a&#xD;
ow voice, "an~d is Mary interested in my fate?&#xD;
Tell me that you love me, bid me. live and act&#xD;
for your peace and happiness, give me hope of&#xD;
a bright day to come, in the future, and you&#xD;
may command me as if I were a slave."&#xD;
" Philip, I can scarcely express what I wish&#xD;
&#xD;
96&#xD;
&#xD;
to say, for I might too deeply wound your feel-&#xD;
ings,'" she replied. ,&#xD;
"Speak, Mary, I will listen, and if I can, I&#xD;
will do all that you wish, " only tell me that&#xD;
you love me, and. all will not, can not yet be&#xD;
lost." -&#xD;
"Philip, I reebe, she said, speaking&#xD;
slowly, as if struggling with the emotions&#xD;
rising in her breast, "the happy days we&#xD;
passed together when we were children,,the&#xD;
fleeting, thoughtless, joyous hours when to-&#xD;
gether we studied under good Uncle Peter.&#xD;
We were alone, and almost friendless then,&#xD;
and I was more so than you, and your polite.-&#xD;
ness, blindness and sympathy awakened a&#xD;
friendship in my heart, which was deepened&#xD;
into love by after years of trouble, when al-&#xD;
most my only consolation was'your letters,&#xD;
full of noble, manly feelings, of cheering,&#xD;
hopeful advice and comfort. When Mr. Mc-&#xD;
Donald acted so .kindly to me and both him,-&#xD;
self and his wife, may God bless them, insist.-&#xD;
ed that I should take their name and be their&#xD;
daughter,the pleasing surprise thatit would be&#xD;
to you, Philip, was a happy dream to me, I&#xD;
thought that you loved me,and counted the days&#xD;
that must pass before we should meet. We met&#xD;
at last, and in your words and hooks I found con-&#xD;
firmation of my dream, but alas! how short&#xD;
was the happiness. Your visits became less&#xD;
frequent each week until they ceased almost&#xD;
entirely. Yet this I could have borne ; yes,&#xD;
had you loved another and. received her love&#xD;
in return, I would have crushed the feelings&#xD;
of my heart, and would have been happy to&#xD;
see you so. But no ! It was not that. You&#xD;
were throwing away health, honor and self-&#xD;
respect in wild dissipations-the reports came&#xD;
to me often-not to me in particular, but they&#xD;
were the talk and regret of all your old friends.&#xD;
Think, Philip, of the happy hours when we&#xD;
knelt together in church as children, think of&#xD;
the kind friends whose hearts are sad at your&#xD;
wild life, think of the shame and dishonor&#xD;
that must inevitably' be the end," and as her&#xD;
'feelings became too -strong to be entirely gov-&#xD;
erned, she continued, her fate bathed in tears&#xD;
and her voice almost choked at times, " and&#xD;
think too, Philip, more earnestly and sorrow-&#xD;
fully, of Our Holy Rledeemer, who suffered for&#xD;
us on the Cross, whose wounds are opened&#xD;
anew by your sinful life, think of His agony&#xD;
and bloody sweat, hear Him call to you from .&#xD;

substantial and steady in character, were&#xD;
availing themselves of every means for getting&#xD;
a Freath of cool air and a little respite from&#xD;
the dust and heat of the city. Business was&#xD;
dull, and so~Philip, closing the store early,&#xD;
turned the key in the lock, and passing it over&#xD;
to the head porter, walked leisurely of4towards&#xD;
Canal street; The sun was yet nearly an hour&#xD;
from his western bed, the~nost pleasant part&#xD;
of the day.&#xD;
"Hello, Phil, how-d'y-where have you&#xD;
been V' exclaimed Louis, as they met on Camp&#xD;
street.&#xD;
"rhavn't bebn anywhere, Lou."&#xD;
"Why, I haven't seen you at the club in near-&#xD;
ly a month !"&#xD;
"No, I've been reading."&#xD;
"Yes! Keeping quiet eh? Where are you&#xD;
going now ?"&#xD;
"Just knocking around."&#xD;
"Let's go to the lake."&#xD;
"Can't go now, Lou."&#xD;
"Pshawt why not ?" said Louis, '~corne&#xD;
along-let's get a horse and buggy and go&#xD;
down. Come, we'll go around to Tattersall's&#xD;
and get Uncas-he's the, fastest horse that&#xD;
travels the Shell."&#xD;
"I can't go this evening, Lou," he replied.&#xD;
"Yes, you can! By Jove, I struck the Havana&#xD;
to-day for five hundred and I'm going to stand&#xD;
treat."&#xD;
"The mischief you did !" exclaimed Philip,&#xD;
"yost are in luck."&#xD;
"Yes, I got five hundred yellow boys," re-&#xD;
plied Louis, jingling a handful of gold "come&#xD;
on, we'll have a horse that nobody can throw&#xD;
dust on."&#xD;
They then went to the stables, and ordered a&#xD;
buggy with the favorite horse iJucas, after&#xD;
which Louis proposed a "mint julep," to which&#xD;
Philip could make no objections, having ac-&#xD;
cepted the invitation for a ride. As they&#xD;
came out of the saloon, Carl Amber came&#xD;
along, and inquired what Philip had been&#xD;
doing with himself of late. After a few mo-&#xD;
ments conversation, Carl proposed that' they&#xD;
should go to Bob's and take a drink.&#xD;
"Come on, by the time we get back 'the&#xD;
horse will be ready," said Louis, and the three&#xD;
went off to get the proposed drink. Philip felt&#xD;
at first a pang of regret and Mary's face came&#xD;
pleadingly isp before him, but he banished the&#xD;
vision, with the self assurance that he had of-&#xD;
&#xD;
ten taken a score of "smiles" without feeling&#xD;
them.&#xD;
When they returned the handsome turnout&#xD;
was ready, and, seated behind the favorite&#xD;
horse, they were soon going rapidly down the&#xD;
shell road, one of the best drives in the coun-&#xD;
try. At the Half-way house they stopped to&#xD;
rest the horse and here another glass was in-&#xD;
dulged in. There were scores of people there&#xD;
they both knew, with whom they shook hands&#xD;
or exchanged friendly salutations. Before&#xD;
leaving, half a dozen more invitationsto drink&#xD;
were received and accepted, when theyonce&#xD;
more took the road. At the lake a bath was&#xD;
the first indulgence, after which the pistol&#xD;
galleries and saloons were visited and as i~&#xD;
usually the case, they gave and receivednumer-&#xD;
ous invitations to drink. A fish and champagne&#xD;
supper followed, over whic~t they lingered, in-&#xD;
dulging freely, until past the noon of night,&#xD;
and then returned to the the city, driving&#xD;
furiously along, heated with wine, not much&#xD;
caring\ what might happen them.&#xD;
The ext day Philip's head was sore, unusu-&#xD;
ally s4 for the conviction of his own con-&#xD;
science\ that he had done wrong, made the&#xD;
natural effects of his night's dissipation, much&#xD;
more 4 yore than they had ever been before.&#xD;
He sat down and wrote a letter to Mary, ac-&#xD;
knowle~lging his fault and promising to avoid&#xD;
such te~nptatione in future. A dozen copies of&#xD;
this were written and destroyed before he had&#xD;
one composed that suited him. As he read&#xD;
over again the last effort, which pleased him&#xD;
exactly, he began to think. "What a fool I am&#xD;
-she'll never know it-besides, what if 'she&#xD;
does? I am no baby, to be tied to her apron&#xD;
strings! It was wrong-yes, well It was-but&#xD;
what's a fellow to do? She is enjoying herself&#xD;
and having a good time gsnerally-am I to set-&#xD;
tie down like a drone here, rolling np my eyes&#xD;
and saying my beads till she returns? No, sir!&#xD;
Phil ain't made for that! What's the harm in&#xD;
having a little fun? I'll have it, hang me if I&#xD;
don't-when a fellow is married its time to&#xD;
put on a long face."&#xD;
The letter was torn in to very little pieces&#xD;
and thrown with the other copies into the&#xD;
waste paper basket. He then went into the&#xD;
sample room an4 opening a half bottle Mumm's&#xD;
Imperial, he drank it to "the health of every-&#xD;
body in general and our friends in particular."&#xD;
Another letter was then written to Mary, it&#xD;
&#xD;
was full of love and endearing phrases; it di-&#xD;
lated on his lonliness and was full of prayers&#xD;
for her happiness and her safe return, and ex-&#xD;
pressed the hope that she would have a gay&#xD;
and joyous season. lIe mailed the letter him-&#xD;
self, thinking as he did so, that he was play-&#xD;
* ing the hypocrite and so he washed the feeling&#xD;
down with a "cobbler" at the Gem.&#xD;
lie became once more a regular visitor at his&#xD;
Club, and drank harder and played more&#xD;
recklessly than aver before.&#xD;
The club was formed originally for the pur-&#xD;
pose of encouraging the members in the study&#xD;
of the drama and to give amateur perform-&#xD;
ances on the stage. All the regular theatres&#xD;
were now closed, and the proposition was&#xD;
made to commence their representations. In&#xD;
order to enlist the sympathies of the public, it&#xD;
was necessary to make it a benefit~ for some&#xD;
charitable purpose. Mrs. Drone, who had been&#xD;
familiar to the New Orleans theatre goers for&#xD;
many a year, and had been in her time a capi-&#xD;
tal "heavy old woman and faithful nurse,"&#xD;
was living in one of the back streets of the&#xD;
city, sick and destitute. The papers had&#xD;
noticed her several times, calling upon the&#xD;
charitable to assist her.&#xD;
William Malwreath proposed that the "Cres-&#xD;
cents" should tender her a benefit; the propo-&#xD;
sition took; a letter tendering her the benefit&#xD;
and one from her thankfully accepting the&#xD;
compliment, were drawn up and puhlishcd in&#xD;
the papers, tickets were issued, the Varieties&#xD;
was engaged, stud two of the men employed&#xD;
about theplace were secured for door-keeper&#xD;
and box-uzlerk. When the night came the&#xD;
weather was fine, the dress circle was full of 1&#xD;
beautiful ladies, in light and elegant summer&#xD;
costume, au~d the balance of the house was&#xD;
crowded to overflowing- The play selected was&#xD;
the "Honey Moon." The principal characters&#xD;
were given to William Malwreath, Carl Amber&#xD;
and Philip, while a young and accomplished&#xD;
actress, then just commencing a career that has&#xD;
since proved brilliant and successful, person-&#xD;
ated Julianna in charming style. Everything&#xD;
went off with decided eclat; the actors acquit-&#xD;
ted themselves creditably; the audience was de-&#xD;
lighted, and the papers next day complimented&#xD;
the club on their great success. t&#xD;
Three days after, a meeting was held to hear&#xD;
a report of the result and to direct the nett ~&#xD;
proceeds to be paid over to ~rs. Drone. The I&#xD;
treasurerr and Committee of Managers had col-&#xD;
&#xD;
lected4n the outstanding tickets and money,&#xD;
and reported that, after paying expenses', there&#xD;
remained to Mrs. Drone the sum of seven dol-&#xD;
lars and sixty cents! Here was a nice report;&#xD;
everybody was surprised and they looked from&#xD;
one to another as if to ask what should b~&#xD;
done. "Mr. Presidentt" said William Mal-&#xD;
wreath, rising, after a brief silence, "we have&#xD;
heard the report, and are too well acquainted&#xD;
with the gentlemen who have subscribed to it&#xD;
to question their accuracy. But this will never&#xD;
do, Mr. President, for the public. We have&#xD;
given a benefit to Mrs, Drone; the house was&#xD;
crowded; tIle public will expect a report, and&#xD;
no outsider wilr believe that the expenses have&#xD;
so nearly eaten up the receipts of so full and&#xD;
splendid an audience. Besides, Mr. President,&#xD;
it would not answer for this club to announce&#xD;
a profit of the paltry sum of seven dollars and&#xD;
sixty cents! We would be the butt of a thou-&#xD;
sand jests and never hear the last of it. I&#xD;
move, therefore, that each member be assessed&#xD;
in the sum of twenty-five dollars, to be paid&#xD;
to-morrow evening, and that the sum so raised&#xD;
be sent to Mrs. Drone."&#xD;
The resolution was ur~animously carried, and&#xD;
the pap~rs of the following Sunday contained&#xD;
Mrs. Drone's card, acknowledging the receipt&#xD;
of several hundred dollars, the net proceeds of&#xD;
the entertainment given for her benefit by the 'Wreo&#xD;
~ents."&#xD;
During the. summer three or four other per-&#xD;
Cormances were given for charitable purposes,&#xD;
bringing on the boards~ such plays as "The&#xD;
merchant'ss Clerk and Tl~e Wife." The theatre&#xD;
was always crowded, thd acting fair and every-&#xD;
body well pleased. The financial results were,&#xD;
however , the same as at the first entertain-&#xD;
nent, the tax on the members following surely&#xD;
in the wake of each one. -&#xD;
Mr. Macourty was much troubled at Philip's&#xD;
~onduct, and gently remonstrated with him on&#xD;
bwo or three occasions. Philip listened with&#xD;
respectt to the counsels of his friend, but they&#xD;
roducyd no change in him. His work was al-&#xD;
rays done, no duty was neglected or allowed&#xD;
lass performed beyond tM proper time of&#xD;
ts execution. "What right has Mr. Macourty&#xD;
o question me about my private life ?" he rca-&#xD;
oned with himself. "I do my work; I do it&#xD;
veil and promptly, and that is all he has any&#xD;
ight to inquire about."&#xD;
And so the time passed on; he frequented&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVmI.&#xD;
The McDonalds' traveled slowly, taking the&#xD;
journey by easy stages and stopping wherever&#xD;
interest or inclination prompted them to do so.&#xD;
Mr. McDonald and his wife loved their daugh-&#xD;
ter truly, and felt the greatest pride and grati-&#xD;
fication in the admiration that she-commanded&#xD;
at all the places they visited.' Whatever was&#xD;
beautiful and attractive, in dress or ornament,&#xD;
was pro ured for her by Mr. McDonald, who&#xD;
never ti :ed in his efforts to make her the most&#xD;
distingu shed of the throng that -visited the&#xD;
summer resorts that season. From Soratoga&#xD;
to the, hite Mountains, thence to Montreal&#xD;
apd down to Niagara, they went, stopping at&#xD;
each place until the desire arose to seek a new&#xD;
field of pleasure. -Philip's letters- followed&#xD;
them wherever they went, and to-Ma'ry, breath-&#xD;
ing noth ng but love and devotion as they did,&#xD;
proved great consolation. To Mr. McDon-&#xD;
aid, who was a shrewd and observant man,&#xD;
and naturally felt the deepest interest in what-&#xD;
ever concerned his daughter, the pleasure with&#xD;
which she received these letters, and the I&#xD;
promptness with which they were answered,&#xD;
told him the story long before Mary raised&#xD;
courage to confide in his wife, and tell her love&#xD;
for Philip and the agreement between them.&#xD;
He felt a deep pang of regret, therefore, at a&#xD;
letter he received while at Niagara, but con-&#xD;
sidered it his duty to show it to her.&#xD;
She was in the parlor of their suit of rooms,&#xD;
and, as he passed through, he handed her the&#xD;
letter, saying : " There's a letter I havo just&#xD;
received from an old friend, and it contains&#xD;
bad news for you."'&#xD;
-She wondered at his meaning, and opened&#xD;
the letter to see what it contained. It was&#xD;
from a New Orleans correspondent, and gave&#xD;
the news and gossip about the growing crops,&#xD;
the course of tradp, deaths and marriages, and'&#xD;
the usual assortment of items that were cur-&#xD;
rent in those " dull, piping times of peace."&#xD;
There was one passage that rivited her atten-&#xD;
tion, and that she read over and over again, I&#xD;
until her head was near bursting with pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
10&#xD;
&#xD;
It ran : i"The summer jhas given our lads a&#xD;
chance to indulge their inclinations to dissipa.&#xD;
tion. Th ere's a delightful crowd of them who,&#xD;
having exhausted the novelties of the club',&#xD;
fast horses and low companions, have now&#xD;
taken to the stage. They played ' The Wife'&#xD;
at the Varieties last night, with -Louis Fon-.&#xD;
tane, Philip Cummings and William Malwreath&#xD;
in the principal characters."&#xD;
Could it be possible that Phzilip, her Philip,&#xD;
once so correct and honorable in every action,&#xD;
had so soon forgotten his solemn promises to&#xD;
her? She could not believe it, and yet here&#xD;
was the evidence that it was so, from an old&#xD;
and highly esteemed friend of her father. His&#xD;
letters were regular, elegantly written and&#xD;
composed, and she could not believe that he&#xD;
would act thus to her. It became her constant&#xD;
thought, haunting her and making her life al-&#xD;
most unbearable. I&#xD;
After they had been a few days at Niagara&#xD;
Mr. MacVain came there also, as he had pre-&#xD;
viously done at Saratoga. With him they&#xD;
again visited the scenes of interest around&#xD;
that grandly beautiful wonder of nature. The&#xD;
burning spring, table rock and Indian village&#xD;
were visited. The different spots of interest&#xD;
on Goat Island were pointed out, and many of&#xD;
the wild stories connected with the place were&#xD;
told by Mr. IMzacVain. As they went over the&#xD;
island, Mr. MacVain and Mary became separat-&#xD;
ed from the rest of the party, when he pointed&#xD;
out to her a seat beneath the trees and pro-&#xD;
posed that they -should rest there until their&#xD;
friends came up. Mary knew that he was con-&#xD;
stantly in communication with their home,&#xD;
and longed to ask him. if he had heard any-&#xD;
thing about Philip, but felt that her interest in&#xD;
the subject was so great that she might, in the&#xD;
conversation, say more than she wanted to'.&#xD;
Mr. MacVain's thoughts were quite different.&#xD;
He had wished for an opportunity to propose&#xD;
his own suit, and believed that he had now&#xD;
found it.&#xD;
" A ild scene, this," heS said, pointing to the&#xD;
falls, 'and one from which we might draw a&#xD;
lesson an the life cf this world."&#xD;
"?Ye , it is, indeed, an appalling sight," she&#xD;
replied "Such volumes of water, the constant&#xD;
roar, and clouds of rising mist, the surrounding&#xD;
scenery, and the wild legends, extending far&#xD;
beyond the time of the white men, all lend a&#xD;
grandeur and a mysterious charm to the place."&#xD;

",The waters of the river," said Mr. MacVain,&#xD;
"flw slowly and peacefully on for a time,&#xD;
passing pleasant fids, grand old forests and&#xD;
quiet homes. As it nears this place its speed&#xD;
increases, until, with a sudden plange,'it passes&#xD;
over the rock down to the abyss below. Thus&#xD;
Swe travel on life's troubled river, now, leisure-&#xD;
ly and observing as we go life's pleasures&#xD;
around us, and then, without warning, comes&#xD;
the dark abyss of death." .&#xD;
" Such lives there are," Mary replied, " yet I&#xD;
should be sorry to think they were so numer-&#xD;
ous as the world asserts they are. To the&#xD;
thoughtful and wise,-the wise in the ways of&#xD;
Him who guides all--the current of life will be&#xD;
as steady and calm at the last us in the begin-&#xD;
ning of the voyage." -&#xD;
"Not so has been my life," hea replied, with&#xD;
an earnestness which startled her. ".I have&#xD;
been tossed and thrown about without an ob-&#xD;
ject or a hope, following no higher rule than&#xD;
the caprice of a wayward mind. Yet therlhas&#xD;
been awakened in my heart a hope of a better&#xD;
life, a longing for a distinct, high and noble&#xD;
purpose, and to you I owe this feeling. Since&#xD;
we first met there has been an influence, an&#xD;
irresistable charm that has drawn me towayds&#xD;
you. With all the earnestness and devotion of I&#xD;
my soul, Miss McDonald, I love you, and I now&#xD;
ask you earnestly, sincerely to be mine."&#xD;
" Mr. MacVain, I regret-" she said, rising to&#xD;
go.&#xD;
"Nay, I beg of you, stay and an wer me I&#xD;
now," he said, interrupting her6 "Yon shall&#xD;
have such a position in society as the proudest&#xD;
might envy, every wish and desire of your&#xD;
heart shall be gratified."&#xD;
"Mr. MacVain, I beg of you to go no farth-&#xD;
er,'? she exclaimed.             -      -&#xD;
" Think of what I offer you," he continued.&#xD;
" You shall have all that boundless wealth can&#xD;
command, and the true, unchanging love of&#xD;
my heart shall always be yours." r&#xD;
S"Mr. MacVain, I have looked upon you as&#xD;
my father's friend," she replied, " and as such,&#xD;
my friend, but it can never be more." ,r&#xD;
."Think well of -it," he said, still pleading a&#xD;
with her, " can I never h pe to be more than a d&#xD;
fnen., . .  ,,n&#xD;
"It is impossible," she replied, " I shall al- a&#xD;
ways value your friendship, and I hope we may c&#xD;
always. be friends, but we can be nothing t~&#xD;
more'.a&#xD;
&#xD;
"I hope we may always be friends, we can&#xD;
be nothing moree" he repeated, as if in com-&#xD;
munion with himself alone. " Are these set&#xD;
phrases with your sex, or has some fiend&#xD;
learned you these words, that you might re-&#xD;
peat them to me ?" and the old sneer came upon&#xD;
his face again as he continued, " words that I&#xD;
bitterly remember to have heard before, and&#xD;
you repeat them now with the same look and&#xD;
tone with which they came then," and his fea-&#xD;
tures relaxed, a look of paiful melancholy&#xD;
covering his face. " Ah ! that magic tone, the&#xD;
gracious touch and queenly bearing that have&#xD;
thrown a spell around me, stirring up the dor-&#xD;
mant feelings of youthful days,.awakening,&#xD;
alas, a hope that is forever shattered and&#xD;
gone I"&#xD;
It was almost frightful to see the strong&#xD;
feeling of agony that worked upon his face,&#xD;
and made his commanding form shake and&#xD;
bquiver like a~forest leaf before an autumn&#xD;
bast.&#xD;
"Mr. MacVain, Ibeg of you to think no more&#xD;
of this," said Mary.&#xD;
" You said we might be friends," he said, as&#xD;
with an effort he mastered his anger, and re-&#xD;
solved henceforth to try and be a better and&#xD;
truer man, "so let it be. If I can ever assist&#xD;
you, command me. Let me he to you as a&#xD;
brother, and believe me, no brother was every&#xD;
more devoted and faithful to a sister, thian I&#xD;
pledge myself to be to you."&#xD;
"I thank you for this assurance," she replied,&#xD;
frankly and kindly accepting his proffered&#xD;
:and, "and I assure, you, in return, that I&#xD;
hope you may be, through life, happy and-&#xD;
prosperous in all things."&#xD;
They now returned to the bridge, where&#xD;
heir friends were awaiting their return.&#xD;
MIary had hastened the valk and was greatly&#xD;
elieved to escape from the embarrassing p)osi-&#xD;
ion.&#xD;
To Mr. MacVain the disappointment was ter-&#xD;
ible ; it was the wrecking of the last hope,&#xD;
ad in his younger days would have brought&#xD;
ark and threatening feelings to his heart, but&#xD;
ow he schooled himself to think of it calmly,&#xD;
nd to yield without anger to his fate. He be-&#xD;
ame more attentive and respectful to Mary&#xD;
han before, and endeavored to look upon her,&#xD;

Summer having passed, autumn-luxuriant&#xD;
in fruits and flowers, blessed with the harvests&#xD;
of the season, came, with pleasant weather,&#xD;
invigorating and cheerful. The fields of snowy&#xD;
cotton, thrifty cane and waving rice, once the&#xD;
grand staples of the prosperous South,-~were&#xD;
yielding their products, and the prospect of&#xD;
sharing in the profits of the commerce which&#xD;
these articles would give impetusto, recalled to&#xD;
their homes, "so-called," the floating popula-&#xD;
tion of New ~ rleans, and with the returning&#xD;
current there came crowds of strangers from&#xD;
all parts of the country, anxious to participate&#xD;
in the business and enjeythe hospitalities and&#xD;
gaieties of that place, then the moSt sociable&#xD;
in the Union.&#xD;
Absenteeism! How much misery, neglect&#xD;
and retrogression has resulted from this curse&#xD;
of tLie South! Her fields have yielded prolific&#xD;
crops, the barter and exchange of which have&#xD;
scattered wealth, with a lavis~i hand, on all&#xD;
wh~ have come within .the circle of their in-&#xD;
* fluence. After gathering wealth, with aston-&#xD;
ishing rapidity for a few years, her "iso-called"&#xD;
citizens take their earnings to enrich and&#xD;
beautify some Northern or Weste: n home.&#xD;
From the plains of the West to the Shores of&#xD;
the Atlantic, from the Ohio .to the Lakes, there&#xD;
is scarcely a full or valley, or the banks of a&#xD;
stream, that has not been improved with the&#xD;
riches drawn from the I South in this way.&#xD;
While millions of dollars belonging to South-&#xD;
ern men, or to those who claimed to be such a&#xD;
*few years ago, are invested in the railroads&#xD;
and steamships of the North, the few enter-&#xD;
prises of that nature started for the benefit of&#xD;
their own cities are allowed to languish and&#xD;
decay for lack of capital. And who so ready&#xD;
to call out against the "lack of energy and&#xD;
enterprise ~' in the South as these "birds of&#xD;
passage,~~ who use *the money made in their&#xD;
business as Southern merchants or planters to&#xD;
build Northern railroads, improve country&#xD;
seats in the North, and who spend thousands&#xD;
of dollars annually in visits away from their&#xD;
own States 'I&#xD;
When the MeDonalds' returned, Philip lost&#xD;
no time in calling upon Mary to express his&#xD;
pleasure at her safe arrival and to hear an ac-&#xD;
count of her trip, the different changes in which&#xD;
he had already heard by letter. Their first&#xD;
evening was passed very pleasantly, although&#xD;
she had fully resolved to remonstrate with&#xD;
&#xD;
10~&#xD;
&#xD;
Philip, and demand that he shor~ld respect his&#xD;
promise to her, Mary allowed the evening to&#xD;
pass without a word on the ~ubjeot. When, in&#xD;
the course of a week or two, she found that&#xD;
everybody was talking abo~it Philip's mad ca-&#xD;
reer, holding up their hand and opening their&#xD;
eyes in "holy horror" at hi dissipation, with&#xD;
a 'true womanly affection s e clung closer to&#xD;
~him, pauiated and excused his faults, and ex-&#xD;
erted all her influence, quie ly\ and secretly,1 to&#xD;
win him back. Every day s e knelt before the&#xD;
altar of the Blessed Virgin, in the old church,&#xD;
and offered her prayers for im, that he might&#xD;
yet see the evil of his wa s and be brought&#xD;
back to the path of truth, h nor and religion.&#xD;
In this course she was strengthened by Mrs.&#xD;
Macourty, with whom she spent much of her&#xD;
time, and to whom she became m~re endeared&#xD;
on Philip's account. Mr. Macourty had twice&#xD;
intended to get some one in Philip's place,.but&#xD;
his wife's entrimtics had deterred him from&#xD;
doing so.&#xD;
"He is a good-hearted boy," Mrs. Macourty&#xD;
said to Mary. "He is not naturally bad, and&#xD;
kindness will win him back. You and IMary&#xD;
dear, must save him."&#xD;
~' My dear George," she said to her husband,&#xD;
"remember that Philip is young, and in time&#xD;
he will get steady enough."&#xD;
"It will not do, Cecelia, he must have a les-&#xD;
son," he replied.&#xD;
"My dear," she continued, "kindness will&#xD;
have a better effect than harsh measures.~~&#xD;
"Why do you favor him so much ?" he asked.&#xD;
"He is the son of a very dear friend," she&#xD;
replied earnestly, "his father was kind to us&#xD;
when we were young, and-he was the play-&#xD;
mate and favorite our lost Cecelia."&#xD;
"I admit all this," he said, "but such con-&#xD;
duct does not look well in the confidential&#xD;
clerk of a commercial house.~~&#xD;
'"What has he done so awful I" she in-&#xD;
quired.&#xD;
"What has he done ?" he replied, a little&#xD;
impatiently. "He drinlrs, gambles and keeps&#xD;
1~ad company."&#xD;
"Well, that's bad enough, but you will not&#xD;
cure him by harsh measures, and cast off he&#xD;
shall not be with my consent,'t she answered&#xD;
spiritedly, and then added, in a joking, mis-&#xD;
ehievious way, "you need not be so hard on&#xD;
him; you were not always so steady yourself.&#xD;

~4e ge Macourty, anel you did not make such&#xD;
a b d man after all 1"&#xD;
T is was unanswerable, so lie gave her a kiss,&#xD;
sai she "always did have her own way," and&#xD;
Ihi ip was spared for a time.&#xD;
P ilip did not improve much; his friend,&#xD;
Col rid Spades, had returned for the season,&#xD;
and ~ as now constantly one of his companions.&#xD;
When Christmas drew near, Philip thought he&#xD;
would have something out of the usual routine,&#xD;
and invited his friends to a Christmas Eve&#xD;
party for batchelors.&#xD;
&#xD;
At nine o'clock in the evening Colonel&#xD;
Spades, Carl and Louis, who were the special&#xD;
guests of the evening, arrived. All the other&#xD;
employees of the store were gone, and Philip&#xD;
had arranged his supper of turkey, ham, pies,&#xD;
cakes and other eatables, with a large supply&#xD;
of liquids, inthe sample room, which was next&#xD;
to the office. After paying their attentions to&#xD;
the lunch provided; and drinking a number of&#xD;
toasts, some "regular," and others quite "ir-&#xD;
regular," the party seated themselves around&#xD;
a table, a new pack of cards was produced and&#xD;
a game of "draw" commenced. The betting&#xD;
was at first very moderate, arid the game was&#xD;
interrupted by the arrival of three friends who&#xD;
had been invited to "look in during the night."&#xD;
More refreshments were taken, and a number&#xD;
of toasts duly honored. The friends went&#xD;
away and the gamO of poker was renewed~&#xD;
the betting being more free than before. The&#xD;
calls of friends were frequent, and at every&#xD;
call the game was suspended, to receive them&#xD;
with becomiuj hospitality, and resumed as&#xD;
soon as they had left. Wine and liqu~ra of all&#xD;
kinds were within reach, and the guest was&#xD;
only asked to "name his brand," and it was&#xD;
prodtieed. After midnight the party became&#xD;
wildly merry; songs were sung, jests and&#xD;
stories were told, and the bottles passed&#xD;
around rapidly. One of the party had re-&#xD;
mained cool and collected; he had appeared to&#xD;
drink more than his companions, but bad, in&#xD;
reality, taken very little. This was Colonel&#xD;
Spades. He was affable, gentlemanly and&#xD;
sociable. He was at times a looser in the game&#xD;
of cards, but acted as if indifferent to the for.&#xD;
tunes of the night. His time had now arrived,&#xD;
and, while amusing the company with well-&#xD;
delivered anecdotes, he increased the bets,&#xD;
stocked the cards, and had soon won all the&#xD;
ready money his companions had about them.&#xD;
Then canie the credit game. He still continued&#xD;
&#xD;
I GRAS;&#xD;
to win, and accepted from his friends their due&#xD;
bills for their losses. When the company&#xD;
arose to leave, the Colonel held Philip's notes&#xD;
for sixteen hundred dollars, and* the notes of&#xD;
the other gentlemen for a large amount. They&#xD;
reached the street a yelling, reckless crowd.&#xD;
The Colonel affected to be as much "gone" as&#xD;
his companions. One of the young men, with&#xD;
a loud shout, seized thc Colonel's hat and&#xD;
placed a pack pf fire-crackers in it with the&#xD;
fuse burning brightly. The crackers popped&#xD;
and banged, knocking the hat around, ruining&#xD;
it completely, while the young men shouted&#xD;
and laughed in high glee. The Colonel&#xD;
laughed with the rest; the loss of the hat was&#xD;
nothing to him, for h~ had made enough du-&#xD;
ring the night to pay his expenses for a sear&#xD;
or more.&#xD;
"Ha! ha! ha! ha! ha! ha!" wentthe Colo-&#xD;
nel, "now, gentlemen, I will have to leave&#xD;
you, for I have no hat, and I can't go bare-&#xD;
&#xD;
headed."&#xD;
He was glad of the excuse to leave them; so,&#xD;
wishing them all a "Merry Christmas" he.&#xD;
went his way. One now proposed a game 'of&#xD;
billiards, another tenpins, and Philip threw up&#xD;
his hat to see '~vhich it should be. The result&#xD;
was in favor of billiards, and they repaired to&#xD;
a popular saloon on Gravier street, where they&#xD;
spent two or three hours at that game.&#xD;
When they again reached the street, they&#xD;
parted, exchanging the conipliments of the&#xD;
season, and Philip returned to his own rooms,&#xD;
a handsomelyy furnished suit, on Perdido, near&#xD;
St. Charles street. When he entered his par-&#xD;
br he was surprised to see Mr. MacVaiu seated&#xD;
on the sofa, quietly reading the morning paper.&#xD;
"A merry Christmas to you, Philip," said he,&#xD;
rising and offering his hand.&#xD;
"The same to you, sir, and many a happy&#xD;
return," replied Philip, giving him a warm&#xD;
shake hands.&#xD;
"I am glad to see you in good spirits, Philip,&#xD;
for I came to speak a few wotds to you on a par.&#xD;
tienlar subject," said Mr, MacVain, at a loss to&#xD;
know how to introduce the conversation.&#xD;
Philip's brow darkened and his lips com-&#xD;
pressed as he heard this, and he took a seat,&#xD;
waiting for his visitor to continue.&#xD;
"You are going the road to ruin and dis-&#xD;
honor very fast," said Mr. MacVain, "and I&#xD;
come to you as an old friend, to rerrnmatrate&#xD;
with you, to warn you of where this life will&#xD;

<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8171-00000053"/>&#xD;
'lead you, and I now ask you, Philip, to think&#xD;
seriously 4~f the matter."&#xD;
Philip f~s toned his fine, large black eyes,&#xD;
which w~re now flashing with anger, on is&#xD;
visitorr, add, after looking him fall in the fa e&#xD;
for a few ~n moments, inquired: "Have you be a&#xD;
to church ~this morning, Mr. MacVain ?"&#xD;
"No-I have not, Philip," answered&#xD;
MacVain, with hesitation, as if sorry to ma e&#xD;
that admission.&#xD;
"Don't you think you had better 'scour yo r&#xD;
own tins' before you trouble your neighbors' "&#xD;
inquired Philip, with a smi!e of sarcasm.&#xD;
"I do not pretend to be faultless. I am f r&#xD;
from doing my duty, as I am free to confess,"&#xD;
dplied Mr. MacVain, "but I have seen enough&#xD;
of this world to know that the company you&#xD;
are keeping and the use you are making of&#xD;
your time will lead you to shame and disgrace."&#xD;
"You will excuse me, sir," said Philip, in a&#xD;
formal, haughty tone, "if I beg to be allowed&#xD;
tomanage my own aff~tirs, and respectfully de-&#xD;
cline the advice of my "old friends."&#xD;
"You are more hardened than I expected to&#xD;
find you," said Mr MacVain, coldly, "but I&#xD;
believe it my duty to speak, and I shall do so&#xD;
without asking your leave. For two years or&#xD;
more you have been the companion of gain-&#xD;
blers and rowdies-"&#xD;
"Let inc-say, Mr, MacVain," said Philip; in a&#xD;
threatening manner, "that I hold you respon-&#xD;
sible for what you say, and shall demand such&#xD;
satisfaction as erie gentleman accords to an-&#xD;
other for your insulting language."&#xD;
"You may send me a challenge if you like,"&#xD;
replied Mr. MacVain, "but I shall not notice&#xD;
it. I have come here resolved to keep perfectly&#xD;
cool and you cannot anger me, but if you can&#xD;
look back to this interview, a year hence, and&#xD;
feel That I have said anything unjust or untrue,&#xD;
I will then either apologize or grantyon what-&#xD;
ever satisfaction you may demand."&#xD;
"I suppose, then, I have nothing for it but to&#xD;
listen," said Philip.&#xD;
"Ask yourself if you have aQted right. Look&#xD;
at the ~lebt your gambling has brought you&#xD;
into. Oh! you need not start-I know what I&#xD;
am talking about," said Mr. MacVain. "What&#xD;
sort of a companion is Colonel Spades for a&#xD;
young man like you ?"&#xD;
"Colonel Spades is my friend," replied Philip,&#xD;
angrily, "and I will not allow him to be tra-&#xD;
4luced behind his back."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"Your. friend I' exclaimed Mr. MacVain, "a&#xD;
black-leg, a common gambler, whom I have&#xD;
seen many a time behind a fare table, detected&#xD;
stocking his cards at poker, and the keeper of&#xD;
a rouge etnoir table. Nice friend, this, for any&#xD;
gentleman. how long do you suppose Mr.&#xD;
Macourty will stand this conduct? Are you&#xD;
not afraid he will discharge you I"&#xD;
U Mr Macourty is not the only merchant in&#xD;
New Orleans,"replied Philip, haughtily, "nor&#xD;
is this the only city in the country. When he&#xD;
wishes to get rid of me he has only to say the&#xD;
word."&#xD;
"That's all very well," replied his friend,&#xD;
"but did you eiter stop to think how it would&#xD;
sound to have it said that you were discharged&#xD;
for drinking and gambling? Did' you ever ask&#xD;
yourself what sort of a letter ofrecommenda-&#xD;
tion Mr. Macourty could give you? I knew&#xD;
your father for many years; he was a kind&#xD;
friend to me arid I owe him much of my pres-&#xD;
ent prosperity. He was a man liked by every-&#xD;
body. Go now to any 6f our old residents and&#xD;
ask who and what he was, and they will an-&#xD;
swer that he was a merchant of the strictest&#xD;
integrity, a man of pure and noble principles,&#xD;
a citizen of the largest liberality and sound&#xD;
judgment. He lived and died respected by all&#xD;
who .knew him,, leaving behind no blot or&#xD;
blemish on his memory. You are his son.&#xD;
Wherever you go he is brought back to the&#xD;
minds of those who meet you, and they say:&#xD;
'~That's the son of Pe~er Cummings." Tell me,&#xD;
will your present conduct reflect credit on that&#xD;
father's name? Will you add to the honor&#xD;
and high reputation of your family ?"&#xD;
Philip was completely disarmed by the course&#xD;
of remonstrance taken by Mr. MacVain, and&#xD;
while he wished that he could reply, he felt in&#xD;
his heart that his friend was right, and he,&#xD;
therefore, remained silent.&#xD;
"This is a good day, Philip, to turn over a&#xD;
new leaf," said his friend, "and I hope you&#xD;
will determine to cut all those loose compan-&#xD;
ions, and begin at once with high and noble&#xD;
aim, a new and better tife. I know that you&#xD;
are in debt, and it will be wounding to your&#xD;
feelings to leave these haunts of dissipation&#xD;
without first paying all you owe. I have,&#xD;
therefore, to say that, if you will promise me&#xD;
to be steady and honorable in the future, I&#xD;
will let ~ou have the money to discharge all&#xD;
those obligations."&#xD;

"I am n'~t yet reduced to accepting charity1&#xD;
Mr. MacVain," replied Philip.&#xD;
"I don't offer it as a charity," said Mr. Mac.&#xD;
Vain. "Y~u can repay me at such times and it&#xD;
such sums as may be convenient to you-yes&#xD;
and, if it will be more agreeable, you can pa~&#xD;
me interest."&#xD;
"I decline your money s'nd your a4vice,'&#xD;
said Philip. "One would thinkthat I was the&#xD;

turned a trump, If I do this or that, the gos.&#xD;
sips are immediately going around, working&#xD;
their jaws and rolling their eyes."&#xD;

"A ver~r pretty state of affairs," he said, so-&#xD;
liloquisin ; "a man but drinks an extra glass,&#xD;
or loses a fev~ dollars in passing an evening&#xD;
pleasantly away, and everybody has his name&#xD;
in their mouths. I wish they'd let me alone."&#xD;
It was now nearly ten o'clock, and he started&#xD;
for the office; not that there was any business&#xD;
to transact, for Mr. Macourty always made it a&#xD;
~complete holiday for his clerks, but then they&#xD;
all went down some time during the morning&#xD;
to receive their employer's congratulations.&#xD;
Each one knew that he would find a letter con-&#xD;
taining many expressions ot~ kindness, and a&#xD;
substantial proof of their friend's appreciation~&#xD;
of their character and services, in the shape of&#xD;
a check, varying in amount according to the&#xD;
value and standing of the recipient. As these&#xD;
checks were drawn by Mr. Macourtey on his&#xD;
private bank account, Philip never knew be-&#xD;
forehand how much was coming.&#xD;
When he entered the store, Tom, one of the&#xD;
warehousemen, greeted him with the usual&#xD;
salutation, and, to his inquiry if there was&#xD;
any one in the office, answered in the negative.&#xD;
Going up-stairs, Philip found a letter on hi~&#xD;
desk in the familiar handwriting of his em-&#xD;
ployer, and in it he found a check for five hun-&#xD;
dred dollars. He looked in the envelope,&#xD;
turned the check over and over, opened the&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
envelope wide once wore, and then fell into a&#xD;
brown study.&#xD;
"Five hujidred dollars! Last year it was a&#xD;
thousand, and business has been better than it&#xD;
was then. Five hundred I that will just ahout&#xD;
pay my little bills, the tailor, shoemaker and&#xD;
so forth. Its queer, there used to be a letter&#xD;
of congratulation, but looking into the envel-&#xD;
ope again, "there's nothing here, not even a&#xD;
scratch, notasimple 'Merry Christmas."' That&#xD;
looks ominous-well, I don't care, they can all&#xD;
go to the devil if they don't like me and 'my&#xD;
friends."&#xD;
Notwithstanding this bravado he felt crest.&#xD;
fallen and miserable. He returned to his room&#xD;
and laying down on his bed he was soon&#xD;
asleep. After five or six hours of rest he got&#xD;
up, an~reflecting on the events of the day, he&#xD;
resolved to put a good face on the matter, lie&#xD;
dressed himself with great care, and after a&#xD;
dinner at a neighboring restaurant, called at&#xD;
Mr. McDonalds. Here he spent an agreeable&#xD;
hour and then proposed that Mary and Mrs.&#xD;
MeDonaki should go with him to Mr~ Macour.&#xD;
ty's, an invitation that was accepted at once.&#xD;
He was looking splendidly, all traces of the&#xD;
carouse of th~ previous night had dissappear-&#xD;
ed, and his spirits were free and gay. They&#xD;
spent a pleasant evening and when he at last&#xD;
parted with Mary at her own door, she was&#xD;
happy and full of hope.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXX.&#xD;
Philip was at work early next morning. Al-&#xD;
though he had not been absent from business&#xD;
at all, he had not worked as perseveringly of&#xD;
late, as had been his custom, and he was,&#xD;
therefore, a little behind in his writing. In&#xD;
addition to the usual routine, it was n9w time&#xD;
to take stock, make up interest accounts and&#xD;
prepare to strike a balance on the books, to&#xD;
ascertain the result of the past year's opera-&#xD;
tions. He was much troubled about his inter-&#xD;
view with Mr. MacVain, who had always been&#xD;
very friendly to him, and whose action on the&#xD;
day previous, his good sense convinced him,&#xD;
was prompted solely by a desire to serve him.&#xD;
He felt that he had lost his temper, and that in&#xD;
this Mr. MacVain had the advantage of him,&#xD;
having been throughout perfectly cool and&#xD;
gentlemanly. After much reflection he came to&#xD;

&#xD;
the conclusion that an apology was due to hb&#xD;
friend, and that his own character and honci&#xD;
demanded that it should be made. He, there&#xD;
fore, wrote the following note, and sent ~t t4&#xD;
that gentleman's office.&#xD;
"NEW ORLEANS, December 26th 1856.&#xD;
I'ercy MacVain, Esq:&#xD;
Dear Sir-Believing that an apology is dm&#xD;
you for my ungentlemanly reception of youi&#xD;
advice, tendered to me yesterday at my rooms~&#xD;
I beg leave to say that I regret the use of any&#xD;
expressions that may have been harsh or&#xD;
wounding to your feelings. I am well assured&#xD;
that your action was prompted by friendship&#xD;
to myself, and, although I could not accept&#xD;
your advice, I feel that it should have been&#xD;
received with courtesy and respect., With as-&#xD;
~nrances of my high esteem, I am&#xD;
Your Friend,    PHILIP CUMMINGS,5&#xD;
To this letter he received an immediate an-&#xD;
swer, couched in the most considerate and&#xD;
conciliating language, ending with the assur-&#xD;
ance that his friend would be pleased to serve&#xD;
him at any time.&#xD;
During the following week, Philip worked&#xD;
steadily at his books and accounts, never&#xD;
leaving the office until late at night.&#xD;
The rooms of the Crescent Club wore bril-&#xD;
liantly lighted New Y~ar's Eve, and crowds&#xD;
were continually going and coming, exchang-&#xD;
ing friendly greetings. Col. Spades was seat-&#xD;
ed in one corner of the front room, apparently&#xD;
intent on reading the papers, but the anxious&#xD;
glances he threw at the clock now and then,&#xD;
and the close scrutiny that he gave each&#xD;
crowd that entered, showed that l~e was ex-&#xD;
pecting the arrival of some person.&#xD;
"Half past nine," he said, out of patience&#xD;
at last, "and Mr. Cummings has not 'come&#xD;
yet. He has not been here since Christmas&#xD;
Eve, for I have watched for him every night.&#xD;
If he thinks he can bluff me, he's mightily&#xD;
mjstakeu. I have got him on a string now&#xD;
and if I don't make a handsome thiqg out of&#xD;
him-I am a fool-that's all." Well, if he&#xD;
don't come here I' can go to see him, and I will&#xD;
do it."&#xD;
Leisurely finishing the bottle of wine which&#xD;
sat before him, he took down his hat and&#xD;
buttoning up his coat, started for Philip's&#xD;
room. The servant there said that Mr. Cum- I&#xD;
mings had riot yet returned, and he walked&#xD;
away slowly soliloquizing as he went.&#xD;
"I~ot home yet-that's strange-where can&#xD;
he be I By Jove! He ulay 'be at the office-just&#xD;
&#xD;
where I want to see him-I'll go around there&#xD;
-I'll insist on having Mr. Macourty~s eheck or&#xD;
- note, for the amount, and as he holds the&#xD;
power of attorney, he will give one or the&#xD;
other to settle the matter. Ha! ha! I will&#xD;
keep whichever he gives me, and hold it over&#xD;
him. Then I'll*make him shell-out; as he is&#xD;
in a large house I ought to make at least ten&#xD;
thousand out of him, for once his foot is in-&#xD;
he can't get out, until he is detected-which&#xD;
may not be for a year or two.&#xD;
Musing thus to himself he walked around to&#xD;
Mr Macourty's store, and looking up saw&#xD;
there was a light burning in the office. He&#xD;
tried the door, it was not locked, he opened it&#xD;
and went in. As he reached the head of the&#xD;
stairs, another man who had seen him enter,&#xD;
opened the door and also went into the store.&#xD;
"What, at work yet I" said Col. Spades, in a&#xD;
"hail fellow, well uret" style, "thaL's too bad,&#xD;
and this New Year's Eve."&#xD;
"Good morning, Colonel," said Philip, leav-&#xD;
ing his desk, where he had been busily engag-&#xD;
ed, "take a seat.. I am getting it up fast now&#xD;
-never do to be behind-hand you know."&#xD;
"Yes-biz is biz," replied the Colonel, cooly&#xD;
taking a seat, "and that brings me to the&#xD;
point of my present visit-about those little&#xD;
due bills."&#xD;
"Yes, well-I think I can fix them soon," re-&#xD;
plied Philip, a little nervous.&#xD;
"There's one for six hundred from last&#xD;
month, and the other of sixteen hundred given&#xD;
last week-" continued the Colonel.&#xD;
"Making a total of twenty-two hundred&#xD;
dollars," said Philip, "well, they are good sir,&#xD;
and will be paid."&#xD;
"Oh! I don't question that !" exclaimed the&#xD;
Colonel. "I am sorry to trouble you, I am in-&#xD;
deed, but the fact is I am short-must raise&#xD;
five thousand, and I thought you would help&#xD;
me."&#xD;
Philip was disappointed he had regarded&#xD;
it as certain that the Colonel would wait op&#xD;
him until the end of the season, and in the&#xD;
mean time his luck might change, or at the&#xD;
worst, he would then try to borrow the&#xD;
amount.&#xD;
"I really am sorry, Colonel," he replied,&#xD;
"but at present it will be impossible for me&#xD;
to pay."&#xD;
"Just think a moment," persisted the Colo-&#xD;
nel," in your position, with so many wealthy&#xD;
friends, you can easily arrange it."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"I cannot go to my friends just now," re-&#xD;
plied Philip, mortified at the Colonel's impor-&#xD;
tunity, "by-and-by, I may do so."&#xD;
"By-and-by-is not now," answered the&#xD;
Colonel, with more firrenes, "these are notes of&#xD;
hand-debts of honor, payable at any&#xD;
moment."&#xD;
"But is has been customary," said Philip,&#xD;
"to give time on them."&#xD;
"Time-time," cried the Colonel, in a half&#xD;
sneering manner, "isn't from the middle of&#xD;
November till now, time 7"&#xD;
"I tell you, sir, I have no money," replied&#xD;
Philip, offended at the other's manner, "and I&#xD;
don't know how I can raise it."&#xD;
"Give me Mr. Macourty's note, I can nego-&#xD;
tiate it."&#xD;
"What, sir, commit a forgery 7" exclaimed&#xD;
Philip.&#xD;
"Not at all, you hold the power of attorney,&#xD;
you are authorized to sign his name, and be-&#xD;
fore the paper comes due, you can raise the&#xD;
money to pay it-qr, if you are short, I will&#xD;
help you," replied the Colonel.&#xD;
"It would never do," said Philip, "Mr Ma-&#xD;
courty has no notes out and the effort to nego-&#xD;
tiate one would-~"&#xD;
"Oh! leave that to me," said the Colonel,&#xD;
abruptly, "I'll put it where he will not hear&#xD;
of it, and you can pay it without a soul's&#xD;
knowing it was ever given."&#xD;
"It will not do, Colonel," said Philip.&#xD;
"No! well-you told me you always had a&#xD;
good balance in bank 7"&#xD;
"Yes-from ten to a hundred thousand," re-&#xD;
plied Phiiip.&#xD;
"Give me a check for the amount-tear it&#xD;
out of the back of the book-with a large bal- 4&#xD;
ance like that, no one but yourself and me will&#xD;
know It."&#xD;
"Can't do it, Colonel-very sorry, but i will&#xD;
not commit a forgery to assist even you,~~ said&#xD;
Philip. 4&#xD;
"Forgery! I tell you it is not forgery, you&#xD;
sign the name of the house teu times a-day-&#xD;
don't you I" replied the Colonel. 4&#xD;
"Sometimes a hundred, but that is in the&#xD;
course of business, and it is for this that I I&#xD;
hold authority-any other use of the signature I&#xD;
-any that I know Mr Macourty would dis-&#xD;
approve of would be forgery-and I will do&#xD;
nothing of the kind," said Philip, firmly.&#xD;
"You will not I" inquired the Colonel, in an&#xD;
angry voice.&#xD;
&#xD;
"No, sir, I will not."&#xD;
"But I say you will-do you see this," and'&#xD;
the Colonel rising from his feet, held towards&#xD;
Philip a revolver.,&#xD;
Philip's face flushed with anger and he made&#xD;
a movement as if he would seize a ruler "to&#xD;
knock his visitor down, but after a moment he&#xD;
replied with a scornful smile. "Put up your&#xD;
weapon, Colonel, I am no fool to be frightened&#xD;
by such a display. You are safe here too, for&#xD;
my character has suffered toomuch already by&#xD;
association with you, for me to wish to black-&#xD;
en it more with your worthless life. Put up&#xD;
your weapon or I'll boot you down stairs."&#xD;
'ISo this is the way you pay your debts of&#xD;
honor 7" said the Colonel, replacing his 'pistol&#xD;
in his belt at his back.&#xD;
"Debts of honor! Debts of dishonor more&#xD;
likely," replied Philip, fiercely, "debts made&#xD;
by submitting to the cheats and tricks of a&#xD;
sharper, a worthless black-leg. You have~&#xD;
showed your hand too soon-~-I see through you&#xD;
now, as I would through apane of glass. Idon't&#xD;
went to have anything more to do with you,&#xD;
but I'll pay those notes-.---when I get the mon-&#xD;
ey; I will send you word. I will pay them&#xD;
dollar for dollar, although I do not believe you&#xD;
won one cent of them honestly."&#xD;
"You don't want to know me any more! oh!&#xD;
no! I suppose not," sneered the Colonel, "I'll&#xD;
tell it in every club in town, in every saloon&#xD;
and house, and to every man I know."&#xD;
"Have a care, Colonel," said Philip, his face&#xD;
flushed and his eyes flashing with anger, "you&#xD;
may out-run even my patience."&#xD;
"I offered you a way to settle this matter,"&#xD;
replied the Colonel, "but you decline it be-&#xD;
cause you do not intend to pay at all. But I'll&#xD;
ax you, I will call on Mr. Macourty and show&#xD;
him what sort of a cashier he has got-what a&#xD;
model young man you are.&#xD;
This was the Colonel's last resort,.and he&#xD;
expectedd it' to crush the young man into im-&#xD;
mediate submission, but h~ was mistaken.&#xD;
"Do so if you like," replied Philip, "Mr. Ma-&#xD;
3ourty has been as kind as a father to me,&#xD;
md I would a thousand times rather trust&#xD;
myself in his hands than in yours. Go tell&#xD;
Am, but know this, sir-I will tell him myself,&#xD;
~es sir, I will go to him myself, acknowledge&#xD;
he whole truth and offer him my resignation&#xD;
f the position I hold."&#xD;
"Very likely," said the Colonel, surprised&#xD;
Lt the turn matters had taken-" but why&#xD;

&#xD;
should we quarrel over this-I have been&#xD;
hasty, you will pay, I know that-~so I ac-&#xD;
knowledge that I have done wrong and I ask&#xD;
your pardon for what I have ~&#xD;
As he said this he advanced towards Philip,&#xD;
offering his hand, but Philip warned him back&#xD;
and answered:&#xD;
"No! sir! I will have nothing more to do&#xD;
with you, I am glad you called, your conduct&#xD;
has done mono to qpen my eyes, than all the&#xD;
lectures of all the friends I ever knew, could&#xD;
have done."&#xD;
"Well, we'll see," replied the Colonel, again&#xD;
assuming the offensive, "we'll see how you&#xD;
will stand in Mr. Macourty's eyes after my in-&#xD;
terview with him to-morrow."&#xD;
"Again I say I do not care for your threats,&#xD;
Mr. Macourty shall know the whole truth from&#xD;
my own lips, said Philip, "and from this hour&#xD;
I pledge my honor and name that I will never&#xD;
touch a card or play a game of chance again.&#xD;
Go now, and when you meet me, pass by me as&#xD;
if you had never seen me, don't dare to recog-&#xD;
nize me under any circumstances. As for the&#xD;
notes, I am not going to borrow money to pay&#xD;
them, nor will I stoop to anything mean or&#xD;
dishonorable to raise it, but I will pay you the&#xD;
full amount a~ soon as I earn the money to do&#xD;
it with."&#xD;
"Pay him-now, Philip, pay the rascal and&#xD;
let him go," said Mr. Macourty, who entered&#xD;
in great excitement.&#xD;
"My dear sir, let use explain-" said Philip.&#xD;
"No necessity for words now, pay him,"&#xD;
said Mr. Macourty, interrupting him.&#xD;
"But sir, the amount is large and I am-"&#xD;
Philip began again.&#xD;
"I know all about It," he replied, "yes, sir,&#xD;
I know all about it," j~se continued, turning&#xD;
upon the Colonel, and shaking his fist at him,&#xD;
"I know who you are, sir, and if it was not&#xD;
that my young man, myson I will call him, is&#xD;
compromised in the matter, you should not&#xD;
have a dollar. Debts of honor I to an unscru-&#xD;
pulous cheat and scoundrel like you! Here,&#xD;
hand over the notes-ah! nise thing this-&#xD;
here's your money, and I regard it, sir, that&#xD;
every cent of it you have stolen-get out of&#xD;
here now, you have nothing more to expect&#xD;
here, and we have no use for you.&#xD;
As he spoke he backed the Colonel out of the&#xD;
door, followed him down stairs and closed the&#xD;
~oor after him when he went out.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Well-he's gone," said Mr. Macourty&#xD;
when he returned to the office.&#xD;
"I don't know how to thank you enough for&#xD;
your kindness," said Philip, with emotion, and&#xD;
scarcely knowing what to do with himself.&#xD;
"Philip, my dear boy, I heard your pledge&#xD;
just now, and it pleased me more than an un-&#xD;
expected profit of ten thousand dollars would&#xD;
do," he replied, kindly patting Philip's back,&#xD;
"don't say anything more about it now, I&#xD;
know you feel grateful, but don't say anything&#xD;
-I'll take your thanks in your future conduct."&#xD;
Philip made no more promises or pledges,&#xD;
but he formed a plan in his own mind, and car-&#xD;
ned it out. His old comrades, with whom he&#xD;
was a great favorite, were surprised at his re-&#xD;
fusal to drink with them, and regretted very&#xD;
much, receiving his resignation as a member&#xD;
of the club. They were pleased to see him do&#xD;
well, however, and he lost neither their love&#xD;
or esteem by hi~ adherence to the rule he had&#xD;
made. The good people, especially a few&#xD;
kind hearted souls who always made it a point&#xD;
to know everybody's business iut their own,&#xD;
were surprised to see him in his old place, in&#xD;
Mr. Macourty's pew on the following Sunday,&#xD;
'but as he made it a point to go regularly after&#xD;
that-the novelty wore off, and th'~y had noth.&#xD;

or would not, soon go off on another spree.&#xD;

ber who came with him. They were as hand-&#xD;
some, intelligent and refined a couple as could&#xD;
be s~hisen in the Crescent City. They ap-&#xD;
pro~ched the coffin to look at their friend,&#xD;
spoke in low whispers and then silently joined&#xD;
Mary. Mr. MacVain soon after entered, and&#xD;
kneeling by the corpse, made the blessed sign,&#xD;
said a prayer for the dead, and then, with a&#xD;
quiet recognitiQn of those present, retired.&#xD;
Many others paid similar attentions to the&#xD;
mortal remains, exposed for the las~t time, to&#xD;
the eyes of this world's people. Then there&#xD;
was a stir in the hall, visitors gave way and&#xD;
with stiff and, stately walk, his head erect&#xD;
and the short curling bair combed haughtily&#xD;
away from his broad, cold forehead, Mr. Al-&#xD;
fred Plant entered the mourning circle. Cast-&#xD;
ing a look around the room to see who was&#xD;
there worthy of his recognition, he calmly&#xD;
advanced to the bier, looked at his late clerk&#xD;
for a few moments and then retired to, the&#xD;
gallery, where he was met by Mr. MacVain,&#xD;
with himself appointed as pall bearers.&#xD;
"A sad calamity, this," said Mr. MacVain, as&#xD;
they exchanged salutations.&#xD;
"Yes, it's a bad job," replied the other.&#xD;
"A n~ble fellow, he was," said Mr. MacVain.&#xD;
"That's what the world said," replied Mr.&#xD;
Alfred Plant, coldy, "and he was a very com-&#xD;
potent book-keeper, but unfit to manage his&#xD;
own affairs, he was careless, thoughtless, and&#xD;
extravagant.&#xD;
"It was a generous act that cost his life,"&#xD;
said Mr. MacVain, surprised at the other's&#xD;
manner and language.&#xD;
"I think it would have been more generous&#xD;
to have thought of his children and let the&#xD;
cussed nigger be killed," was the reply.&#xD;
"It is a great pity, I am sorry for his fami-&#xD;
ly," said Mr. MacVain.&#xD;
"Yes-that's the sentiment of the world-&#xD;
weep and cry because people who live beyond&#xD;
their means finally find themselves poor," said&#xD;
~ Alfred Plant, in a sneering, haughty man-&#xD;
&#xD;
110&#xD;
&#xD;
nor, "look at the extravagance of this turn&#xD;
out, mahogany coffin, silver plate and a dozen&#xD;
carriages, where's the money to come from to&#xD;
pay for such display.&#xD;
* "Indeed," replied Mr. MacVain, with a&#xD;
slight touch of sarcasm, "the generosity of&#xD;
your firm is so well known that I was sure the&#xD;
whole matter had been planned and arranged&#xD;
by your orders."&#xD;
"No, sir. I have enough to do to attend to&#xD;
my own affairs," wat the cold and dignified re-&#xD;
ply.&#xD;
"At such a time," said Mr. MacVain, as if&#xD;
apologizing for the family, "people are not apt&#xD;
to stop to think of economy, but think that&#xD;
the best is not good enough for their loved&#xD;
ones, and indeed I think it is a great ~nisfor-&#xD;
tune for his poor wife."&#xD;
"She's young and healthy," replied Mr. Al-&#xD;
fred Plant, in an off-hand manner, as if to dis-&#xD;
miss the subject, "and she's very good looking&#xD;
-she'll soon mairy again."&#xD;
Mr. ~!acVain made no reply in words, but&#xD;
his look was full of anger, scorn and contempt,&#xD;
quniling before it even the cool, calculating&#xD;
Mr. Alfred Plant who felt the rebuke and turned&#xD;
away. ~?rom that time they were never friends,&#xD;
Mr. MacVain felt a thorough contempt, but&#xD;
little concealed, while Mr. Plant disliked the&#xD;
other frdm a knowledge of his own inferiority.&#xD;
The house and yard was by this time filled&#xD;
with those who had come to the funeral, the&#xD;
relations came into the room, the Priest per-'&#xD;
formed the appropriate ceremony of the Church,&#xD;
the last sad farewells were said, the corpse was&#xD;
carried to the hearse, the 'company entered the'&#xD;
carriages and the cortege slowly and solemnly&#xD;
moved away to the St. Louis Cemetery, where,&#xD;
amidst the speechless grief of his fismily and&#xD;
the silent, heartfelt sorrow of many friends,&#xD;
the remains of Richard Cheerful were laid to&#xD;
rest. In after years the place was often wet&#xD;
with the bitter tears of the loved ones he left&#xD;
behind, and decorated with bouquets and flow-&#xD;
ers, or a simple wreath of evergreen, by the&#xD;
hand of some person, who remembered and&#xD;
thus acknowledged his unostentatious acts&#xD;
of charity and benevolence.&#xD;
Mr. Cheerful died in February, and it was&#xD;
now the latter part of April. His business&#xD;
affairs, as was expected, were in very bad or-&#xD;
der, his liabilities summed up a very large&#xD;
amount and the creditors were pressing in&#xD;
bheir demands for money. Of all those whom&#xD;

he had accommodated during his life, many of&#xD;
whom were largely indebted to him at the&#xD;
time of his death, only two had offered to as-&#xD;
sist his bereaved family. One of these was a&#xD;
baker, who had been started in his business&#xD;
by Mr. Cheerful, and the other was a widow,&#xD;
herself, poorly off, to whom he had loaned&#xD;
from time to time, small 8ums of money.&#xD;
The time had come when it was impossible&#xD;
for Mrs. Cheerful to satisfy the creditors by&#xD;
askin~a further delay and she was therefore&#xD;
prep~rsng to call on some of their old 'friends&#xD;
to ask their advice and assistance. She direct-&#xD;
ed her steps towards the office of Cane, Plant&#xD;
and Cotton where her husband had served so&#xD;
many years. Mr. Cane was in Europe, and&#xD;
had been absent for nearly a year, so that&#xD;
she knew her business would be with&#xD;
Mr. Plant. She had always received from him&#xD;
the greatest courtesy and respect, and had no&#xD;
doubt but that he would take an active and&#xD;
friendly interest in her affairs.&#xD;
Mr. Alfred Plant was walking up arid down&#xD;
the elegantly furnished private office, his mea-&#xD;
sured step was scarcely audible on the rich&#xD;
carpet that covered the floor, he was without&#xD;
his hat, and 'the smoke from his cigar, from&#xD;
which he gave at regular intervals, meditative&#xD;
puffs, curled in light clouds around his finely&#xD;
shaped head, as with his hands crossed behind&#xD;
him, he promenaded to and fro, lost in some&#xD;
pleasing dreaming, or conning over some new&#xD;
plan for business or pleasure.&#xD;
Mrs. Cheerful noticed that a stranger held&#xD;
Dick's o~d place, for Mr. Plant did not believe&#xD;
in rotation with clerks but always aimed to&#xD;
get the best man for the least possible money,&#xD;
and hating long regarded Dick's salary as too&#xD;
high, which he could not change before on ac- a&#xD;
count. of the opposition to the movement by&#xD;
Mr. Cane, he had filled the place with a new&#xD;
man who would not expect so much as an old&#xD;
hand in the house would have looked for, Mr. s&#xD;
Cane being absent he was able to arrange the v&#xD;
matter to suit his own views of "political e&#xD;
economy."&#xD;
As he made a turn in his walk Mr. Plant oh- ~&#xD;
served his visitor and gracefully offered her a, ii&#xD;
seat, which she accepted. He was quite socia-&#xD;
ble and friendly, but in a ~igid, formal manner, a&#xD;
"Mr. Plant, I have com9 to ask you for ad-&#xD;
vice and assistance," she said after a few me- "&#xD;
mentsconversation, at the word "assistance" h&#xD;
&#xD;
he grew cold and dignified in the* extreme'&#xD;
"my business is in a very bad state; we were in&#xD;
debt when poor Dick died, and in order t~&#xD;
satisfy these people, until I can earn money,&#xD;
I am cernpelled to ask a loan."&#xD;
"Yes-just as I supposed," replied Mr. Plant&#xD;
"what do you propose to do to earn money."&#xD;
"I was thinking, sir-of opening a school,'~&#xD;
she replied, with hesitation, for she felt his&#xD;
cold manner, "I could give music lesson~, and&#xD;
have hopes of success."&#xD;
"A school! that's alv~ays a woman's resort&#xD;
that or a boardinghouse 1" exclaimed Mr. Plant~&#xD;
impatiently.&#xD;
"What shall I do, sir 7" she asked, nervously.&#xD;
"Do! well, I don't know, can't you get a&#xD;
situation in a millenery store or something of&#xD;
that sort 7" he inquired.&#xD;
"If I do, sir," she answered, " I will still&#xD;
need ~assistance for a time."&#xD;
"And I must give it, eh 7" he said, with a&#xD;
sneer.&#xD;
"Well, sir-I th~ought-perhaps-"&#xD;
"How much did you want I" he inquired~&#xD;
interrupting her.&#xD;
"I think with-about five hundred dollars,"&#xD;
she answered~ "I could pay them all some-&#xD;
thing. I owe about fifteen hundred dollars-'&#xD;
"And Mr. Cheerful's account was overdrawn&#xD;
with us three hundred dollars," he said, again&#xD;
interrupting her.&#xD;
"Yes-well, it will all be paid in time," she&#xD;
replied.&#xD;
"In time! That's mere nonsense. You'll&#xD;
iever pay any of it," he said, angrily, "but I&#xD;
suppose you think that I am bound to support&#xD;
~ou because your husband chanced to work for&#xD;
no. Paid in time! That's what all borrowers&#xD;
I shall do all I can to accomplish it," she re-&#xD;
died.&#xD;
"All very well, madam, all very well," he&#xD;
aid, haughtily, "but I cannot assist you. It&#xD;
rould be 'against the principles of political&#xD;
economy to encourage living spendthrifts by&#xD;
supporting the family of a dead one, and it&#xD;
rould be no kindness to you to encourage you&#xD;
i going into debt."&#xD;
"I shall try to work out of debt, sir," she&#xD;
uswered.&#xD;
"Yes, but you can't," lie said, abruptly.&#xD;
Your husband ought to have been ashamed of&#xD;
himself for going in debt, and now what a fix&#xD;

extravagance in him to do it."&#xD;
" I did not come to hear the memory of my&#xD;
husband insulted," said Mrs. Cheerful, rising&#xD;
to her fect. " He was a good, kind, generous&#xD;
man."&#xD;
"Very generous," -said he, with a sneer, "to&#xD;
spend all he earned and leave you and your&#xD;
children tQ be supported by me'.,,&#xD;
"You have not done much towards it yet,"&#xD;
she said, " and I do not wish you to do more)'&#xD;
" Oh, here is ten dollars," he replied, in a&#xD;
condescending manner, "and I may give more&#xD;
by-and-by.','                     -&#xD;

As she finished speaking she turned and left&#xD;
the room, but had not gone far before he called&#xD;
her back.&#xD;
" She's a d-d pretty woman," he said, in&#xD;
communion with himself. -A little flirtation&#xD;
would be exciting for a change."&#xD;
" Here, Mrs. Cheerful-really-" he said, as&#xD;
she returned to the office- " if you must have&#xD;
this money-why-I will give it to you, and-&#xD;
I'll call to see how you get along ini a day or-&#xD;
two."&#xD;
" A peculiar light was playing in his eyes,&#xD;
and a hypocritical smile spread over his face,.&#xD;
With the innate feeling of self-protection al-&#xD;
ways the companion of virtue, Mrs. Cheerful&#xD;
drew back from him and indignantly replied:&#xD;
"Not one dollar would I take from you if the&#xD;
possession of it should purchase me ease and&#xD;
comfort for the remainder of my life. I am&#xD;
sorry that I wronged my feelings by coming.&#xD;
here. You have insulted and slandered the-&#xD;
memory of my husband, and I pray.God that&#xD;
His malediction may follow you for it. Keep&#xD;
your money ; treasure it in your heart ; draw&#xD;
your soul more into your miserable self, if it&#xD;
is possible, and live, as you always have, on&#xD;
your own admirations. But don't come near&#xD;
me ; never cross the threshold of my house, nor&#xD;
recognize me in the street. I would not even&#xD;
speak to a man for whom I felt the thorough&#xD;
contempt and loathing that I do for you."&#xD;
She was not like herself, her face flushed,&#xD;
&#xD;
her eyes flashed with anger, and her whole&#xD;
manner became haughty and dignified, as she&#xD;
looked for a moment at the baffled rouc and&#xD;
then retired, leaving him to his .own thoughts&#xD;
and fancies.&#xD;
CHAPTER xXII.&#xD;
The summer season being at :hand, the&#xD;
s' floating population " of the Crescent city,&#xD;
those who had made fair profits in business&#xD;
during the season, the capitalists and property-&#xD;
holders who had gathered in fine rents and&#xD;
dividends, and the clerks, mechanics and&#xD;
artisans, who had saved the splendid wages&#xD;
that had rewarded their labors, were preparing&#xD;
to go North or Westward to spend or invest&#xD;
their "balances," ihus leaving th Crescent&#xD;
City thousands of dollars poorer, and furnish-&#xD;
ing a cogent reason for the continued existence&#xD;
of the swamps and forests, and the non-im-&#xD;
provement of the hundreds of beautiful sites&#xD;
for country seats, gulf and lake coast resi-&#xD;
dences in the neighborhood of that city. .&#xD;
Mr. Macourty was'one of those who believed&#xD;
in home improvements. His surplus capital&#xD;
was invested in real estate and stocks of his&#xD;
own State and city, and his summer i-etreat&#xD;
was on the lake coast, as well improved,&#xD;
pleasant and healthy a location as could have&#xD;
been found in any part of the Union.&#xD;
-As he sat at the tea table, his family around&#xD;
him, they were talking over their departure for&#xD;
Biloxi, and each one had some happy sugges-&#xD;
tion to make about the arrangements&#xD;
"I think .you ought to send over a new&#xD;
piano," said Cecelia, "the ,one we had last&#xD;
year was about played out&#xD;
" I don't think you a'played it out,'" said&#xD;
young George, "for yen hardly ever touch a&#xD;
piano."&#xD;
" Yes I do," replied Cecelia, sharply, "I play&#xD;
as good as Annie."&#xD;
" Well, I'll see about it," said Mr. Macourty,&#xD;
drawing from his coat pocket a large package,&#xD;
neatly tied up.&#xD;
" What is that, my dear i" inquired his wife.&#xD;
" It is three thousand dollars, for Jones," he&#xD;
replied. " He will be here in the morning for&#xD;
it."&#xD;
" Why did he not go to the store for it 7"&#xD;
''Well, he is not much of a business man and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
112&#xD;
&#xD;
preferred coming here," he replied. " The&#xD;
deeds for the lots are all made out and signed,&#xD;
so I told him to come here and get'his money,&#xD;
ats he wanted it that way." .&#xD;
The conversation was continued until the&#xD;
meal was over, turning on various subjects of&#xD;
interest at the time. When they were retiring&#xD;
at night, Mrs. Macourty remarked that "Mrs.&#xD;
McDonald's family would leave on Wednesday&#xD;
for the North." -&#xD;
."Yes; Philip is going as far as Montgomesy&#xD;
.with them," he replied. -&#xD;
" I am sure it will be a pleasant trip for&#xD;
hims," she said.&#xD;
" I am glad he is going,/' he replied. " He&#xD;
needs some recreation. It will do him good."&#xD;
h" He came out allright ater al, did, he not?'&#xD;
"My dear, I am as much gratified at the fact&#xD;
as you are."&#xD;
Iknow it, George," she replied.&#xD;
" Yes, if I'hilip was my own son I could not&#xD;
think more of him than I do," he said, eanest-&#xD;
ly, "and I am proud to say that he is all that&#xD;
I could wish, and, by the way, I got a letter&#xD;
from Len Browsee to-day." -&#xD;
,"Ah! is -he coming home in".&#xD;
." No ; he likes the country so well that he&#xD;
has written to have his mother and sistrs&#xD;
come over," he replied, " and I have been&#xD;
thinking of establishing a branch house there'.&#xD;
Len has recovered his health, he says, so that&#xD;
he can attend to business, and he likes thie idea&#xD;
of a branch house, which I have .no doubt&#xD;
would be very successful."&#xD;
" He is a careful, good man," said Mrs. Ma-&#xD;
courty, " and willnianage the business proper-&#xD;
ly, I know."&#xD;
-"Yes ; I think so, and snall make arrange-&#xD;
ments to send his folks over and remit him&#xD;
funds to commence business there."&#xD;
" That reminds me," said his wife, with a&#xD;
sudden start, " what did you do with that&#xD;
package of money 7"     ..'&#xD;
"It is here," he replied, laughing, " and I I&#xD;
will stick it under the foot of the mattress.- No&#xD;
cne will ever think of looking there for it,&#xD;
even if such a thing was possible that any one I&#xD;
would come at all." -&#xD;
While they were in the sitting room next j&#xD;
morning, Mr. Macourty reading aloud such x&#xD;
items from the morning paper as were of in- I&#xD;
terest, one of the servants came in and ani-&#xD;
&#xD;
nounced that Mr. Jones was waiting in the&#xD;
parlor.&#xD;
"y George, the money is up stairs yet !"&#xD;
exclaimed Mr. Macourty, anid he ran up stairs&#xD;
for it, but soon called out to his wife to know&#xD;
if she had taken it. Mrs. Macourty hurried up&#xD;
stairs and said she had not seen it since the&#xD;
night before. They searched the bed, armoir,&#xD;
bureau, everywhere, but it was gone. All the&#xD;
servants were questioned, and, the children&#xD;
were called in and asked if they knew any-&#xD;
thing about eit. The search was fruitless. Mr.&#xD;
Macourty knew that he had placed it between&#xD;
the mattresses at the foot of the bed and that&#xD;
he had not seen it since, yet it could nowhere&#xD;
be found. There was no way for it but to ask&#xD;
Mr. Jones' into breakfast and then take him&#xD;
downtownandpay im tere&#xD;
That evening Cecelia called at M. Le Cras-&#xD;
seaurK's, and, as was usual in pleasant weather,&#xD;
she and FeliZ went out for a pro nenade. Ever&#xD;
since her short 'residence at Le Crasseaux's it&#xD;
had been a settled thing with the neighbors&#xD;
that "it was to be a match." These rumors&#xD;
had reached Mrs; Macourty, who remonstrated&#xD;
with Cecelia, telling her that there were many,&#xD;
good young men who visited the house thai&#xD;
she would prefer to see her marry, pointing out&#xD;
Felix's indolent, unsteady character, his lack&#xD;
of energy and perseverance, and exercising all&#xD;
her Arts of persuasion to prevent the match.&#xD;
But Cecelia was only made stronger in her de-&#xD;
termination by, this advice, and constantly&#xD;
thought herself the most abused of human&#xD;
beings. Mr. Macourty had joined his wife in&#xD;
her opposition at first, but, finding the girl&#xD;
headstrong, bad privately told her that be&#xD;
thought it best to give Felix a little start in&#xD;
business and let them go ahead. This hia&#xD;
wife, being unwilling to give up her efforts to&#xD;
change Cecelia's mind, had kept to herself.&#xD;
-But Felik had never told his love. All that&#xD;
Cecelia knew was merely by inference fronm his&#xD;
actions and the talk of the neighbors. She&#xD;
had often endeavoredl to " draw him out * but&#xD;
all the satisfaction shle could get was that "he&#xD;
wvas too poor to marrkr, if he had a little money&#xD;
he knew who he wenuld ask to be his wife' Al-&#xD;
hiough it pleased him to have the neighbors&#xD;
oke him about C celia, he boasted that he had&#xD;
never told her t at he loved her, never had&#xD;
hinted at such a 1hing and did not know how-&#xD;
he could think i.&#xD;

would do ~io good to say anything else, "and&#xD;
it was very wise in you to do it."&#xD;
As they were walking along the street next&#xD;
day, Felix lagging behind, Cecelia met Philip,&#xD;
who was returning to New Orleans, after ac-&#xD;
companying the McDonald's as fnr as Mont-&#xD;
gomery.&#xD;
"Why, Cecelia, what are you doing over&#xD;
here'?" said Philip,&#xD;
"I am on my way to New York," she replied.&#xD;
~tThe deuce you are," he exclaimed.&#xD;
"Yes, six~, I am," she answered and, turning&#xD;
to Felix, who just then came up, she said, "and&#xD;
this is my husband."&#xD;
Philip was much surprised, hut, as it was&#xD;
none of his business, he merely congratulated&#xD;
them, wished them much happiness and passed&#xD;
on. Arriving in New Orleans, he informed Mr.&#xD;
Macourty of his meeting with Cecelia, and, for&#xD;
the first time that gentleman formed a correct&#xD;
suspicion of where his lost money had gone.&#xD;
Although he felt very indignant at the un-&#xD;
grateful girl, he said nothing about t~he matter,&#xD;
but concluded, as he told his wife, that he had&#xD;
got rid of her cheap.&#xD;
CHAPTER XxXLu.&#xD;
Mr. Percy MacVain, having met a severe&#xD;
disappointment in his courtship wi h Mary,&#xD;
had returned again to his search fter Mrs.&#xD;
Macourty's lost child, and displayed ~ en more&#xD;
energy than before. But the time had passed&#xD;
when he could reasonably hope for success. If&#xD;
living, the lost one was no longer a child, but a&#xD;
woman in years, and in all probability so&#xD;
changed that none of her relatives ever would&#xD;
know her. He called again on Mr. Emanuel,&#xD;
but received no satisfaction. The pawn-broker&#xD;
said that his clerk, a stupid fellow that he sel-&#xD;
dom left in his store alone, had told him the&#xD;
day before, when he Came in after a few mo-&#xD;
mdnt's absence, that a young lady had called&#xD;
and looked at all the crosses in the store, but&#xD;
went away without buying, as she said the&#xD;
one she wanted was not there. He thought&#xD;
that she was merely a "shopper," and had, I&#xD;
therefore, paid no attention to her appearance,&#xD;
and could tell nothing more about the matter.&#xD;
Mr. MacVain, in his own mind, entered up the&#xD;
~Ludgment that this was the person for whom&#xD;
&#xD;
he was looking, but as she had been disap-&#xD;
pointed in her search, the probabilities were&#xD;
that she would not come again. Reluctantly&#xD;
admitting this view of~ the case he left the&#xD;
store and turned his steps towards the Astor&#xD;
House, where Mr. McDonald's folks were stay-&#xD;
ing at the time. As he walked down the&#xD;
street, a gentleman on the other side, turned&#xD;
to the lady with him and said.&#xD;
"Cecelia, there goes Mr. MacVain."&#xD;
"Mr. MacVain-who is lie ?"&#xD;
"Why, he's a great friend of Mr. Macourty,&#xD;
don't you know him'?"&#xD;
"No, I never would go into the parlor when&#xD;
he called there," she replied, "although I re-&#xD;
member hearing them speak of him."&#xD;
Feli4 Le Crasaseaux and his bride went on&#xD;
their way, she pointing out to him many ob-&#xD;
jects of interest that she remembered, and tell-&#xD;
ing him of some of the grand displays she had&#xD;
seen in the city.&#xD;
-When ML. MacVain called at Mr. McDonald's&#xD;
rooms, he found them all well and much&#xD;
pleased to see him.&#xD;
"Let me introduce to you my old friend, Mr.&#xD;
Sellwell," said Mary to him, and that gentle-&#xD;
man stepped ~forward and gave him a~ warm&#xD;
reception.&#xD;
"Happy to see you, ~r. MacVain," said Mr.&#xD;
Sahiwehl.&#xD;
"And I am glad to s~e you," said 'the other&#xD;
and, after a closer look~ he continued, "do you&#xD;
ever practice pistol shooting now ?"&#xD;
"What! upon my word! why, I didn't&#xD;
recognize you," said Sam.&#xD;
"I seldom forget faces," replied Mr. Mac.&#xD;
Vain, "although I am not as good at remem-&#xD;
bering names."&#xD;
"You are not married yet Mr. Sellwell ?" in-&#xD;
quired Mrs. McDonald.&#xD;
"Not I, indeed," said Sam, gaily. "it would&#xD;
be a sin to iiiflict such a punishment as myself&#xD;
an any lady"'&#xD;
"Now, that is the way people talk," replied&#xD;
~Irs. McDonald, "when they are on the point&#xD;
)f committing matrimony."&#xD;
"Indeed, you are wrong, persisted Sam.&#xD;
"Mr. McDonald came in just then, and was&#xD;
pleased to see the visitors and joined in the&#xD;
conversation .&#xD;
"You have not made up your mind to visit&#xD;
rnr city yet," he said to Sam.&#xD;
"Well1 not exactly" renhied Sam. ~'&#xD;

" Ah ! ha! yellow fever, eh 7" said Mr. Mc-&#xD;
Donald, " oh ! he wouldn't trouble you, he'&#xD;

" I think I might have gone out there but for&#xD;

ald.&#xD;
"It depends almost entirely on the nursing&#xD;
and attendance that the patient receives," said&#xD;
Mrs. McDonald,&#xD;
" Certainly," said MacVain. ,&#xD;
"If you come out you shall have the best of&#xD;
care if you are sick," said Mrs. McDonald,&#xD;
" and , although I am not much skilled -in&#xD;
medicines, I am sure we would help you&#xD;
through a light with the saffron gentleman."&#xD;
" I will think it over," replied Sam.&#xD;
.After an hour or two passed thus in friendly&#xD;
conversation they parted. Mr. McDonald lind&#xD;
acknowledged Sam's kindness to Mary by&#xD;
several valuabl- presents, and had offered to-&#xD;
do more, but Sam positively refused to accept&#xD;
the favor, threatening, if the subject was again&#xD;
referred to, he would be very much insulted.&#xD;
The autumn brought the usual tide of re-&#xD;
turning citizens and strangers to New Orleans.&#xD;
Cecelia's first business on her return home,&#xD;
was to purchase, in her own name, a lot of&#xD;
ground, with a small cottage on it, which,&#xD;
with the furniture she bought, took up nearly&#xD;
one half of her reserve fund. Felix had a no-&#xD;
tion of cabinet-making, repairing furniture,&#xD;
etc., and she gave him the balance of the&#xD;
money to start a shop in thatline; before doing&#xD;
so, however, she required of him a marriage&#xD;
contract acknowledging the reciept of the&#xD;
money from her. She had got comfortably&#xD;
settled in her new home when Mr. Macourty&#xD;
called on her and congratulated her on her&#xD;
happy union.&#xD;
" The money which you took from me," he&#xD;
said, " you are welcome to. Had you come to&#xD;
me and told -your determination to marry, I&#xD;
would have done better by yonu; but, as you&#xD;
chose to help yourself, I shall accept the bar-&#xD;
gain as it stands."&#xD;
Finding herself detected, Cecelia made no&#xD;
effort to deny the charge, but thanked him for&#xD;
his kindness and invited him to call often.&#xD;
The neighbors were now satisfied. .The&#xD;
&#xD;
question of the match between Felix and&#xD;
Cecelia was settled, and they had very little&#xD;
further to say about them, and when they did&#xD;
talk, they found a match in Cecelia, who was&#xD;
able to hold her own with the best gossip of&#xD;
them all,.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXIV. ~&#xD;
All Saints' Day, one of the greatest holy days&#xD;
of the year's calander in the Catholic city of&#xD;
New Orleans, dawned cold and cloudless on the&#xD;
city, bringing to thousands of hearts and&#xD;
homes sorrowful memories of the loved and&#xD;
lost, and the whole city, as if with one accord,&#xD;
came forth to visit the " Cities of the Dead,"&#xD;
and express their deep regrets and cherished&#xD;
loves for the silent ,sleepers, resting there&#xD;
from the cares and troubles of this changing&#xD;
world.       '.&#xD;
To the stranger who chances to be within&#xD;
the Crescent City it is a strange, solemn, yet&#xD;
pleasing sight, to see the unanimity of feeling&#xD;
amongst her citizens that prompts them thus&#xD;
to visit'the homes of the dead, decorating thie&#xD;
places where their friends repose, and treating&#xD;
with reverence the humblest grave, whose oc-&#xD;
cupant, long since forgotten, perhaps with no,&#xD;
friends left to tell over his virtues, is now&#xD;
numbered with the long li of " unknown."&#xD;
No other holy day, or holiday, in the year's&#xD;
circle, so thoroughly enlists the hearts and&#xD;
sympathies of the people as this, the first day&#xD;
of November, known in the Church as All&#xD;
Saints' Day&#xD;
Business is almost entirely suspended, the&#xD;
clerks, even of the most exacting employers, are&#xD;
allowed ant hour or two, and the streets are&#xD;
thronged from morning to night by crowds of&#xD;
people of both sexes, of all ages, , conditions&#xD;
and nativities, going to and fro between the&#xD;
different cemeteries,.&#xD;
In the depot of the Carrollton Railroad there&#xD;
was a fruit stand, kept by a young Italian,&#xD;
then almost a stranger in the city. One end of&#xD;
his counter was cleared up, a white cloth with&#xD;
a neatly fringed border was spread over it, on&#xD;
whhinh lay a bunch of rare and beautiful flow-&#xD;
ers, and a long, tapering candle was burning'&#xD;
beside it,.&#xD;
" What does this mean P inquired a passer- .&#xD;
by of the young man.,&#xD;
&#xD;
116&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"For my mother, sir," the Italian reverently&#xD;
replied, "I cannot visit her grave, for she&#xD;
rests'in my own native country, " yet I can&#xD;
remember her here.",.&#xD;
What a touching and beautiful tribute to the&#xD;
memory of his mother ! Thousands of miles&#xD;
separated him from the soil that held her&#xD;
oherish'.d form ; the deep ocean rolled between&#xD;
them ; he was a stranger in a strange land;&#xD;
friendless and alone, yet his heart wyas full of&#xD;
the memory of the past, and, although he&#xD;
mnigh, not decorate the little green mound, he&#xD;
could not forget her affection and care. In his&#xD;
far distant native land her body reposes, but&#xD;
the spirit of that mother hovers in eternal love&#xD;
over the path of her affectionate son. .&#xD;
In all the cemeteries, Protestant as well as&#xD;
Catholic, Odd Fellows', Masonic and Firemen's,&#xD;
the graves were decorated, the mementoes,&#xD;
consisting of every ornament that love and do-&#xD;
votedness could suggest. The tombs a ere&#xD;
newly whitewashed, the railings enclosing&#xD;
those buried in " mother earth " were repaint-&#xD;
ed, the slabs and head boards were washed or&#xD;
newly varnished, fresh sods were laid and&#xD;
choice flowers planted around the sacred&#xD;
places'.&#xD;
On the tombs and graves were placed bou...&#xD;
quets of the rarest and most fragrant flowers,&#xD;
the funeral wreath, evergreens in crosses and&#xD;
wreaths, immortelles, flowers in vases, statuettes&#xD;
representing faith, hope' and charity, and an&#xD;
innumerable number of miscellaneous orna-&#xD;
ments. Everywhere the living were to be seen&#xD;
coming with their offerings, or already arrived,&#xD;
arranging, in the most appropriate and taste-&#xD;
ful manner, the decorations over the resting&#xD;
places of deceased friends, while thousands of&#xD;
visitors crowded every avenue by which "God's&#xD;
Acre " was intersected, divided and arranged.&#xD;
Mounds of earth, tombs of brick, granite and&#xD;
marble attracted attention on every hand,&#xD;
many of them the receptacles of some&#xD;
of the oldest inhabitants of the city, some of&#xD;
the families being wholly extinct.; Here&#xD;
were monuments and cenotaphs to 'the old&#xD;
citizens and cherished sons of the State, who,&#xD;
when living, had, by their acts, illutninated the&#xD;
page 'of history, or left a name for charity and&#xD;
the good deeds that enshrined them in the&#xD;
hearts of their fellow -citizens. Affectionate&#xD;
tributes were every where seen and many beau-.&#xD;
tiful inscriptions were displayed, one of&#xD;
&#xD;
w hich would with appropriate meaning apply&#xD;
to all:*&#xD;
"A household tomb, to faith how dear-&#xD;
Aar hae goe, part linger here;&#xD;
A household still."&#xD;
In the immense throngs that were going&#xD;
and coming, it would be impossible to describe&#xD;
all the beautiful scenes that occurred. But in&#xD;
the Cemeteries of St. Louis, the oldest in the&#xD;
city, the custom was best observed, here the&#xD;
observance of the day was a duty and devel-&#xD;
oped into a true Christian sacrifice.&#xD;
Three ladies, followed by a colored servant,&#xD;
with a basket filled with flowers, entered and&#xD;
going to an elegant marble tomb, the front of&#xD;
which rested on pillars of the same stone,&#xD;
.where art had modelled beautiful figures and&#xD;
inscribed a glowing epitaph, the ladies with&#xD;
delicate taste adorned the tomb with the flow-&#xD;
ers, and then devoutly knelt in prayer.&#xD;
A family group came in, and one, a little&#xD;
child of scarce four years, carried a beautiful&#xD;
bouquet of violets, tripping along, it at last&#xD;
stopped before a modest looking tomb and left&#xD;
the flowers for "little brother," who wnshimself&#xD;
a flower in Heaven. The mother knelt and&#xD;
tears chased each otlher down her cheeks,'as&#xD;
she thought of the little curly head that for a&#xD;
brief time nestled on her breast.&#xD;
And there comes, with light elastic step,&#xD;
form erect and cheeks glowing with youthful&#xD;
health and beauty, a lady scarcely yet reached&#xD;
her twentieth year, yet the sombre weeds of a&#xD;
widow, cloth her form, the long crape veil&#xD;
crape collar and bonnet, and all the other&#xD;
signs of recent bereavement are hers. She&#xD;
pauses before a recently opened tomb, the&#xD;
plaster that sealed it up is not yet dry, and&#xD;
here she kneels to weep and pray. The folds&#xD;
were not yet out of her bridal costume, when&#xD;
she donned the garb of a mourner, a maiden&#xD;
wife and widow, all in the short period of one&#xD;
month.&#xD;
We say that this grief will be assuaged by&#xD;
passing years, the smile will come again, the&#xD;
lips will become mobile once more, and the&#xD;
bloom of happiness will chase the paleness&#xD;
from her cheeks. Truly, we say, it is a mnerci-&#xD;
ful provision that time dries all tears, soothes&#xD;
the wounded heart and heals all sorrows.&#xD;
Pause a moment in the judgment.&#xD;
Here comes leaning his tottering I'orm on his&#xD;
heavy cane, a man, on whom the suns of near-&#xD;

&#xD;
iy eighty s mmere have shone. His hair,&#xD;
whito and s~ft as silken fio~s, falls over his&#xD;
shoulders, hi head is bent down, and his face&#xD;
has been browned by exposure and furrowed&#xD;
with trouble and care. He frequently pauses&#xD;
in his walk, for he is old and feeble, and he&#xD;
reads as he passes along the inscriptions by&#xD;
the way. Ah! so many die young, yet he is&#xD;
left to wander and mourn alone, for all of his&#xD;
circle have gone before him. At last he pauses&#xD;
before an old brick tomb, around which wild&#xD;
shrubs and rank grass are growing, and over&#xD;
its sides the green moss clusters here and&#xD;
there-we should say it was neglected and&#xD;
that the occupants were all long since forgot-&#xD;
ten, but that we see him there, and the immor&#xD;
tdlles that he has bought to hang on the old&#xD;
tomb. There are six wreaths, siniple and&#xD;
plain, but of different sizes, and there are six&#xD;
occupants ia this house of the dead. The&#xD;
largest wreath is in memory, of the wife and&#xD;
mnpther, who sleeps side by side with her five&#xD;
children, for whom the smaller wreaths are&#xD;
mementoes. Having arranged his offering,&#xD;
the old man leans upon the tomb and seems&#xD;
lost in reveries of the past, while t~ars course&#xD;
their way down his wrinkled cheeks; the pas-&#xD;
sers by, all things are unnoticed and uncared&#xD;
for by him. We quietly steal to his side and&#xD;
read the simpJe inscriptions on the old tomb,&#xD;
and start back surprised, for the last of those&#xD;
silent sleepers, was laid away to rest full thir-&#xD;
ty years ago!&#xD;
What! do human grief and human constancy&#xD;
last so long?&#xD;
Early in the forenoon Mrs. Cheerful and the&#xD;
children went to the St. Louis Cemetery, tak-&#xD;
ing each one a bouquet or wreath, which they&#xD;
placed upon the plain and unpretending tomb&#xD;
that contained the remains of Mr. Cheerful.&#xD;
A plain, marbieslab, bore his name, place and&#xD;
date of birth and death, and a modest tribute&#xD;
to his virtues as a husband and father .ind his&#xD;
upright character as a citizen.&#xD;
After decorating the tomb, Mrs. Cheerful,&#xD;
with the children around her, knelt and offered&#xD;
up their petitions to Our Heavenly Father for&#xD;
the soul of their loved one. These devotions&#xD;
over, they all arose and after a longtng look at&#xD;
the tomb, turned to go away. .i~ust then a&#xD;
gentleman who had been respectfully waiting&#xD;
at a distance for them to leave, came forward&#xD;
and placed on the vault an elegant bouquet.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mrs. cheerful happened to look back and wit-&#xD;
nssse~l the action, and recognized Mr. ~Mac-&#xD;
Vain, who, seeing that he was observed came&#xD;
forward and spoke to her, and then to each of&#xD;
the children itt a kind and friendly manner.&#xD;
"I was coming up to see you ~ he&#xD;
said as they walked on, "I only got home two&#xD;
or three days ago."&#xD;
"I am glad to see you Mr. MacVain," she&#xD;
replied.&#xD;
"I wished to speak to you," he said, in the&#xD;
most friendly tone, "about business. I have&#xD;
heard of your interview last spring with Mr.&#xD;
Plant and the unkind answer he gave you, and&#xD;
I much regret that I did not know of it sooner.&#xD;
Your husband and I were good friends, more so&#xD;
perhaps than you knew of, and it will be a&#xD;
great pleasure to me to see that his family are&#xD;
well provided for."&#xD;
"I thank you Mr. MacVain," she replied,&#xD;
"but I have commenced a school and hope to&#xD;
meet with success-"&#xD;
"Excuse me," he said, interrupting her, "I&#xD;
do not wish to be offensive or to intrude, what&#xD;
I offer is based on my high esteem of your ex-&#xD;
cellent husband, and the deep respect I feel&#xD;
for yourself. I have no doubt but that in time&#xD;
you will \succeed with your school but for the&#xD;
present ~ou will need assistance . I have heard&#xD;
the whole story of your troubles and truly&#xD;
sympathize with you for the vexations you&#xD;
have had, but you must not feel backward&#xD;
about accepting help from me. Should you&#xD;
succeed as you hope to and as you deserve,&#xD;
you can repay me, but otherwise it must never&#xD;
give you the least uneasiness."&#xD;
They conversed further about her business&#xD;
as they walked towards Canal street and Mr.&#xD;
MacVain promised that he wo~ild arrange&#xD;
everything properly and in such a manner that&#xD;
she would be troubled no more.&#xD;
Although Mr. MacVain acted in the kindest&#xD;
and most delicate manner and was thoughtful&#xD;
and respectful in all he said, it was a great mor-&#xD;
tification to her to be compelled to acceptassist-&#xD;
ance, but there was no alternative between that&#xD;
and seeing her children turned on the street,&#xD;
for ~r. Shavier who held Mrs: Cheerful's note&#xD;
for a thousand dollars had already obtained&#xD;
judgment for the amount.&#xD;
She had just laid aside her bonnet and shawl,&#xD;
after returning home, when Mary McDonald&#xD;
called to see her.&#xD;
&#xD;
1&#xD;
&#xD;
118&#xD;
&#xD;
"I am so glad to see you, Mary, dear," she&#xD;
said, "for I have been in great trouble the past&#xD;
few days, and this visit to poor Dick's grave&#xD;
has recalled so many joys and pleasures that&#xD;
can come again no more. Oh! I am so glad&#xD;
that my dear, kind, good husband cannot&#xD;
know of the trouble and mortification, the ter-&#xD;
rible sorrow that I have had since his death, it&#xD;
would make him so miserable. He was always&#xD;
so thoughtful, so gentle and loving and now to&#xD;
think of him, in that narrow cell."&#xD;
Mrs. Cheerful gave way to the sorrow that&#xD;
filled her heart, for a time she sat almost mo~&#xD;
tionless, her face burned in her hands, while&#xD;
she cried bitterly over her terrible bereave-&#xD;
ment. Tears did her good, and after them,&#xD;
she looked up relieved and more composed.&#xD;
"He is not in that narrow cell," said Mary,&#xD;
soothingly, "only the body, the earthly clay&#xD;
lies there, immortal spirit, the soul which God&#xD;
gave, relieved from worldly cares and ail-&#xD;
iments, is now rejoicing in the realms of bliss.&#xD;
We know that he was a just and upright man,&#xD;
living in the fear and love of our Heavenly Fa-&#xD;
ther. That charity for others which\he prac-&#xD;
ticed with an open hand will be returned to&#xD;
him now many, many times over, and as he'&#xD;
lived and walked in the ways of our Holy1&#xD;
Church and died with faith and confidence in I&#xD;
the intercession of Our Holy Mother and the&#xD;
mercy of Him who died on the Cross, we&#xD;
know that he is now receiving his rich reward'&#xD;
with those who surround the eternt4 throne,&#xD;
where the love, power and splendor of the&#xD;
Holy Trinity are sung in anthems of praise,&#xD;
and the voice that we loved to hear so much&#xD;
here on earth is yet xi~ore clear and har-&#xD;
monious in that Heavenly choir."&#xD;
"There, Mary, darling, very true, but it so&#xD;
hard to lose one so dear t~ us," replied Mrs.&#xD;
Cheerful.                               I&#xD;
"It is natural and it is right th~t we should&#xD;
mourn the loss of those who are near and dear&#xD;
to us," said Mary, while her face beamed with I&#xD;
th~ holy faith that filled her soul, "yet we&#xD;
should remember that after a well spent life,&#xD;
our loss is indeed their gain, and while we&#xD;
feel poignant grief for their departure, we&#xD;
should turn with confidence to mother Church&#xD;
for strength and consolation, for truly the Ca-&#xD;
tholic f.tith is an anchor and safeguard to&#xD;
those who are oppressed with sorrow and be-&#xD;
reavement. Row nothingg to the torn heart&#xD;
~tre a few moments of devout prayer and mcdi-&#xD;
&#xD;
tati' n in a quiet1 holy church before the altar&#xD;
of the Blessed Mary, or in the seclusion of your&#xD;
own room before the emblem of salvation."&#xD;
"God bless, you, Mary," replied Mrs. Cheer-&#xD;
ful, "you are always so comforting, you direct&#xD;
my thoughts in th~ way they ought to go and&#xD;
I sometimes wonder that one so young and&#xD;
gay can appreciate sorrow as you do."&#xD;
"I have seen it myself, have lost dear friends&#xD;
and have been in deep trouble too," said Mary~&#xD;
and then changing the subject she continued,&#xD;
"but you wanted to see me."&#xD;
"I want you to help me arrauge Dick's pa-&#xD;
pers," replied Mrs. Cheerful. '1 never have&#xD;
mustered courage to touch them and there&#xD;
they are in his desk just as he left theni2!&#xD;
"When do you wish it done ?"&#xD;
"Any time, whenever you have leisure."&#xD;
"I will help you now, if it will be con-&#xD;
venient for you," replied Mary, and the offer&#xD;
was at once accepted.&#xD;
One of the children brought a hunch of keys&#xD;
one of which unlocked "Papa's desk," and1the&#xD;
turning over, examination and assortment of&#xD;
Dick's accounts, letters and papers was begun.&#xD;
Having been a book-keeper he had~kept every.~&#xD;
body's papers straight but his own and they&#xD;
were all mixed through each other. Here&#xD;
were old bills from the time he served as "mud&#xD;
clerk" on the Mississippi, bills of fare and oth-&#xD;
er papers connected, with his trips as first&#xD;
clerk in the Louisville trade, letters from pas.-&#xD;
sengers who had traveled with him and re-&#xD;
turned thanks for courtesies shown them, ~the&#xD;
portraits of numerous passengers, both ladies&#xD;
and gentlemen, who had grown enthusiastical-&#xD;
ly friendly during their voyage, copies of old&#xD;
songs, violin strings, sheet inneic, half worn&#xD;
cravats, and some dozen or more due bills&#xD;
from men to whom he had made loans of&#xD;
money.&#xD;
"These you ought to give to Mr. MacVain,"&#xD;
said Mary, as she came to some of the last&#xD;
mentioned articles, "a~ he has promised to at-&#xD;
tend to your business, he might get something&#xD;
for them."&#xD;
"Just leave them out tl~en, Mary," replied&#xD;
Mrs. Cheerful, "and I will show them to him."&#xD;
"Mamma, there is a geatleman in the parlor&#xD;
wishes to see you," said one of the children.&#xD;
"Very well, dear, tell him I am coining,"&#xD;
her mother replied, preparing to go.&#xD;
"What is this 1" asked Mary, as she opened&#xD;

"1 suppose it is," replied Mrs. Cheerful, "wS&#xD;
always had our furniture insured, Dick said it&#xD;
was best to do so," and she went to the parlor&#xD;
to see what the gentleman wa~ited.&#xD;
'~ Mrs. Cheerful ?" said the gentleman, rising&#xD;
and politely bowing to her.&#xD;
Yes, sir."&#xD;
"My n~me is Bloss, madam, Henry Bloss,&#xD;
attorney-at-law."&#xD;
Mrs. Cheerful felt her cheeks pale, and a&#xD;
chill passed over her as she thought of the&#xD;
~iuit SIr. Shaver had brought against her,&#xD;
t~r the thousand dollars Dick owed him.&#xD;
"Be seated Mr. Bloss," she replied, recover-&#xD;
ing herself, "you wish to see me on business ."&#xD;
"Yes, madam."               -&#xD;
"Proceed, I am ready."&#xD;
"You wrote, madam, some six weeks ago"&#xD;
l~e replied, "to Mr. William Belden of Ne&#xD;
York, advising him of your husband's death"&#xD;
"I did, sir, my husband used to send hi&#xD;
*,oney to be paid to an aunt residing nen&#xD;
New York. I should have written sooner b t&#xD;
I had forgotten hi~ address."&#xD;
"Yes, madam, he informed that you said o&#xD;
md wrote to me as an ~ld friend of his to at.&#xD;
reud'~ to the .business. I should have called&#xD;
sooner but I was in Bat~n Rouge on affairs of&#xD;
toy own."&#xD;
"Yes, sir! What business did he wish you Ic&#xD;
attend to I"&#xD;
"Then you really knew nothing about it?&#xD;
Why, bless my soul, here's a pleasant sur-&#xD;
prise I"&#xD;
"surprise! What surprise ?" inquired Mrs.&#xD;
CheerfuL "Is his aunt coming out here 1"&#xD;
"Aunt? There is no aunt about it," he re-&#xD;
plied. "The money that Mr. Cheerful remit-&#xD;
~ed so regularly to Mr. Belden was not for his&#xD;
a~unt at all."&#xD;
"Not for his aunt! You are mistaken, sir."&#xD;
"No, madam, I am not. The fact is, that&#xD;
when Mr. Cheerful was in New York, some&#xD;
years ago, he had his life insured, and Mr. Bel-&#xD;
den acted as his agent in paying the annual&#xD;
premiums."&#xD;
"His life insured 1"&#xD;
"Yes, madam, that's what he did. Hegot&#xD;
ten thousand dollars in the Good Provision&#xD;
Company, of which Mr. l3~Lden is president,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
BELL WI! TIMES.                      120&#xD;
and ten in the Family Protecting, and five&#xD;
each in the All Right and Forethought Com-&#xD;
panies-making in all thirty thousand dollars."&#xD;
"You surprise me, sir."&#xD;
"I expect so, madam. You see, Mr. Belden&#xD;
became acquainted with Mr. Cheerful through&#xD;
some mutual friends in New York, and intro-&#xD;
duped to him the advantages of life assurance.&#xD;
Mr. Cheerful, with his usual good judgment-&#xD;
for I knew your hvsband well-entered into&#xD;
the matter at once, and the premiums have&#xD;
been regularly paid ever since. Something&#xD;
like five or six hundred dollars a year it was."&#xD;
"Yes, I remember we~l," replied Mrs. Cheer-&#xD;
ful, "and he told me it was for an old aunt of&#xD;
his. The fact is, I had opposed his desire to&#xD;
get his life insured, and I suppose he thought&#xD;
it would worry me if he told me he had done&#xD;
it, although since his death I have thought I&#xD;
was wrong in keeping him from doing so."&#xD;
"Well, as soox~ as Mr. Belden received your&#xD;
letter he called on the other companies inter-&#xD;
ested, and he now writes me to pay you five&#xD;
thousand dollars on account, and send on the&#xD;
legal proofs of Mr. Cheerful's death when the&#xD;
balance of the money will be remitted at once.~t&#xD;
"I hardly know what to say. I am much&#xD;
surprisedd at this good fortune.~~&#xD;
"If Mr. Belden had been written to sooner&#xD;
von would have had this money long ago,~' re-&#xD;
,lied Mr. Bloss; "as it is, here is a check for&#xD;
lie five thousand dollars, and the balance will&#xD;
~oon come.&#xD;
The business was arranged. Mr. Bloss're&#xD;
tired, promising to call again as soon as he&#xD;
heard from New~ York, and Mrs. Cheerful re-&#xD;
turned to Mary.&#xD;
"See, Mrs. Cheerful," said Mary, as she en--&#xD;
tered, "theseare not fire policies, but life in-&#xD;
sura~1ce policies, and they have been regularly&#xD;
renewed. Here are the receipts."&#xD;
"I know, my dear," replied Mrs. Cheerful;&#xD;
"the gentleman who called just now came&#xD;
about that. Here is a check for five thousand&#xD;
dollars on account, and he says the remainder&#xD;
will be here in about three weeks, as soon as&#xD;
certain documents needed in the. ease can be&#xD;
sent on and answered."&#xD;
When Mr. MacVain called on the day fol-&#xD;
los~'ing, Mrs. Cheerful gave him the check and&#xD;
an account of the interview with Mr. Bloss.&#xD;
All the rapers were placed in his hands, with&#xD;
a list of the amounts she owed, including the&#xD;
three hundred dollars due Cane, PlaAt &amp;amp; Cot-&#xD;
&#xD;
ton, and all of thcse 'ebts were paid at once.&#xD;
By the advice of Mr. Mac Vain she purchased&#xD;
a nice little place where her family would&#xD;
have a comfortable home, and the remainder,&#xD;
with that soon received from New York, was&#xD;
well and judiciously invested.&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
At the time that our story opened the&#xD;
chronicles 6f the day were lamenting that&#xD;
the ancient spirit of the Carnival t~ime had&#xD;
disappeared an(l that Mardi Gras day, the&#xD;
grand finale of the season of pleasure had been&#xD;
given over to a c~ wd of roughed; that half&#xD;
grown youths, neitheV men nor boys, had usur-&#xD;
ped the obse~ance of a day that had once been&#xD;
a time ofjoyous hilarity, and had turned it into&#xD;
a rioting scene of rowdyism and buffoonery,&#xD;
inften throwing mud, bric1~s and other danger-&#xD;
ous missiles, covering the unlucky passer by&#xD;
with flour or worse still, white sand and lime,&#xD;
eudanmge~iug the life and lm~alth of their&#xD;
victims.&#xD;
The progress of our narrative has brought us&#xD;
to a more pleasant time, the over grown boys&#xD;
net with more propriety, and the rowdies have&#xD;
retired altogether or keep within bounds, and&#xD;
the ancient feeling that made the day one of&#xD;
so much pleasure, has returned with renewed&#xD;
strength. For two or three week-s mysterious-&#xD;
ly delivered envelopes, enclosing cards of rare&#xD;
beauty and tiste had been circulating in the&#xD;
Crescent City, commanding the recipimmts to&#xD;
appear at the Gaiety Theatre on Mardi Qras&#xD;
night, Tuesday, February 16th 1858, there to&#xD;
meet Comu~s, the God of Festivity and his&#xD;
Mistic Krewe. The secrecy observed by the&#xD;
Krewe and the fact that all the invitations&#xD;
were complimentary and not transferable,&#xD;
gave the affair additional interest, and the&#xD;
fair ladies and gallant beaux of the city were on&#xD;
the qei vice anxiously expecting, each one, that&#xD;
their invitations would come next. When&#xD;
Philip received his, he scrutinized it carefully&#xD;
and exclaimed "That's from Mr. MacVain, I'll I&#xD;
bet."                                   Ii&#xD;
The Krewe, which has since become a cher- (&#xD;
ished institution with the good people of our t&#xD;
Southern Metropolis, had made their first ap-&#xD;
pearance the proceeding year with so mouch ~&#xD;
success, that their second festival was looked a&#xD;
&#xD;
forward to with great delight, and although a.&#xD;
thousand tongues asked, "Wno are the. Mistic&#xD;
Krewe of Comus I" there was not one to an--&#xD;
swer with the certainty that he was correct.&#xD;
The knowing ones, nodded their heads, looked&#xD;
wise and pointed in the direction of the Delta.&#xD;
Club, but who ever they might be, all were-&#xD;
agreed that they were gentlemen of wealth,&#xD;
for that was proven by the expensive and&#xD;
brilliant costumes they wore and the freedoni.&#xD;
with which they dispensed their favors, that&#xD;
they were men of education and refinement,&#xD;
because of the good taste displayed in the se-&#xD;
Jection of -~ubjects for their parades and the&#xD;
appropriateness of all the appointments rela~&#xD;
ting to their exhibitions, and that they were&#xD;
men of public spirit was evident from the fact&#xD;
of their endeavors to add to the enjoyment of&#xD;
the masses by their elegant torch-light pro-&#xD;
cessions through the streets, restoring to the&#xD;
festival much of that ancient glory, the de-&#xD;
parture of which had heeti i~ cause of regret to~&#xD;
all.&#xD;
The day was warm, bright and beautiful&#xD;
and the services at the different churches were-&#xD;
well attended. As the morrow would usher in&#xD;
the season ~f Lent, given u~ to religious ob-&#xD;
servances, when all festivities and public&#xD;
amusements would be abandoned for the time?&#xD;
it is not strange that the Carnival season&#xD;
should culminate on Mardi Gras day, with all&#xD;
sorts of innocent amusements, out of doors&#xD;
and in doors, grotesque processions, prac-&#xD;
tical jokes and a universal abandon to&#xD;
festivity and merry making. The stores were&#xD;
kept open it is true, hut very little restraint&#xD;
was placed on the employees, and both mer-&#xD;
chants and their clerks, were mo~uf the day&#xD;
around their store doors, or on the street&#xD;
[ocking at the sights. Everywhere maskera&#xD;
were to be seen, singly and in groups, repres-&#xD;
~nting an endlesss variety of characters, from&#xD;
mis Majesty of the Realms Below, to the gay&#xD;
~avalier of ancient times.&#xD;
A troop of dusty savages, in war paint and&#xD;
magle plumes, mounted on spirited horses, rode&#xD;
rough the city, wheeling here and there,&#xD;
uttering the wild "whoop" and going through&#xD;
~ther evolutions peculiar to the warriors of&#xD;
he forest.&#xD;
Numerous groups in express and baggage-&#xD;
vagons drove through the city, some dressed&#xD;
s clowns, some as knights, others as gentle-&#xD;

.nzen of court circles, old men in spectacles,&#xD;
.aigd Yankees in long-tailed coats. .&#xD;
The streets were fn11 of people, young and&#xD;
e ~ld, rich and poor, all seemed to enter with&#xD;
spirit into the amusements of the day.&#xD;
At the elegant rooms of the Delta Club,&#xD;
composed of the " solid men " of the city, the&#xD;
gathering was large and members were con-&#xD;
tinually going and coming, all of them dis-&#xD;
posed to make a holiday of the occasion. .&#xD;
" Hillo, Plant, how are you old bo.y," said a&#xD;
*gentleman just.coming in. .&#xD;
" Why, Dan, \I thought you were out in&#xD;
mnask" answered Mr. Plant. ..&#xD;
" Not 1! the programme of to-night will be&#xD;
*nough for me," ;he replied, "come let's have a&#xD;
bottle of wine, gnd drink to the church, the&#xD;
~state and the people."&#xD;
As he said thiis in a jocular, totte, the wine&#xD;
was produced and Mr. Plant joined him. Dan&#xD;
ilock~ett, was one of the most social members&#xD;
-f the favored circle, familiar with every one,&#xD;
his familiarity was so well timed and genial&#xD;
as to be acceptable to even the most reserved&#xD;
and dignified. When. their glasses were filled&#xD;
Mr. Rockett observed Mr. MacVain enter, and&#xD;
-eizing him by the arm, drew him over to the&#xD;
&amp;amp;iar. " Come join us, Percy,~' he said, "we are&#xD;
doing the honors to the day''"&#xD;
Mr. MacVein joined them, and between him-&#xD;
self and Mr. Plant, a forma bow of recogni,-&#xD;
tion passed. ,&#xD;
*" Isay, Percy, who was th at young lady I&#xD;
sawv you speak to just now on Canal streetV'&#xD;
inquired Dan.&#xD;
" The young one was Miss Annie Macourty."&#xD;
" No, no, the tall one, by jove she's a queen&#xD;
din slender and beauty."&#xD;
" That was Miss Mary MacDonald, Robert&#xD;
McDonald's daughter," -replied Mr. MacVain,&#xD;
-"she is to be married during the Easter holi-&#xD;
-days to young Cummings-.&#xD;
" Eh, Gad!I he's a lucky dog," said Dan, "for&#xD;
she is a charming lady in appearance, and&#xD;
will have plenty of rhino to boot. Here's to&#xD;
,Phil's choice, and all happiness go with them."&#xD;
All drank but Mr. Plant who stopped at* his&#xD;
wine, held it up to look through it and again&#xD;
tasted it, Mr. Rlockett turned away to speak&#xD;
to another friend, when Mr. Plant said some&#xD;
thing a low tone which he did not hear, but&#xD;
which Mr. MacVain answered with, " That's a&#xD;
.lie, sir, and you know it."&#xD;
&#xD;
122&#xD;
&#xD;
"'You're a                   " said Mr.&#xD;
Plant, throwing the contents of his glass in&#xD;
MacVain's face, which was immediately an-&#xD;
swered by a blow from MacVain which felled&#xD;
him to the floor. Other gentlemen at once in-&#xD;
terrfered to prevent any further hostile de-&#xD;
monstrations.&#xD;
"Stand back, Percy-my God .gentlemen&#xD;
this won't do," cried Mr. Rockett stepping be-&#xD;
tween theip, "this place is sacred to festivity&#xD;
and good fellow-ship and there must be no&#xD;
fighting or quarrels amongst our members."&#xD;
" You shall answer for thip," said Mr. Plant,&#xD;
scowling at his antagonist.    .     '&#xD;
," Wherever and 'whenever you please,"~ was&#xD;
.the haughty reply-.&#xD;
'lPl send a friend to your office in half-an-&#xD;
hour," continued Mr. Plant-.&#xD;
"Il be there to answer his silmmons," Mr.&#xD;
MacVain, cooly replied'.&#xD;
Friends again, interfered and both gentle-&#xD;
men left the Club escorted by others .to see&#xD;
that no further immediate trouble occurred.&#xD;
The crowds on the streets increased all the.&#xD;
time until as night came on the route through&#xD;
which the' Mistic Krewe were expected. to '&#xD;
pass was lined by thousands of people waiting&#xD;
patiently for the grand maskers. Every bal-&#xD;
conf, gallery and door step was occupiedd -to&#xD;
its fullest capacity, the beauty, fashion,&#xD;
wealth and refinement of the city were out in&#xD;
thousands, .the -whole forming one of the&#xD;
grandest sights ever seen in the Crescent City.&#xD;
The weather was beautiful, a clear, calm&#xD;
evening, followed a warm, fine day and this&#xD;
encouraged even the staid old "stay at homes"&#xD;
who seldom turned out to see such exhibitions, .&#xD;
to come forth and witness the grand display.&#xD;
The Krewe assembled in Layfayette Square&#xD;
at nine o'clock in the evening with torchlights&#xD;
and music, no one knowing whence they hiad&#xD;
come. Here they were called upon by t e&#xD;
Mayor of the city, who was immediately taken&#xD;
prisoner and the procession moved off in the&#xD;
following order:&#xD;
Coms-the God of Festivity and titular pat-&#xD;
ron of the Order, leads the procession followed&#xD;
by&#xD;
Mornus-God of Mirth, /&#xD;
Janus-God of the Years, in a ear embel-&#xD;
lished with emblem of his character, and at-&#xD;
tended by the four seasons, Spring, Summer,&#xD;
Autumn and Winter.&#xD;

thology of ancient days, presenting to lthe&#xD;

and procession round the stage:&#xD;
"Come let us our rites begin,&#xD;
S   'Tis only dayli'ht thatmakes sin', n&#xD;

The termination of the last tabilean was a&#xD;
procession around th~e theatre, giving the spec-&#xD;
tators a close view of those whose elegant&#xD;
costumes and unique masks had so delighted&#xD;
and amused them.&#xD;
After that the merry dance commenced, the&#xD;
varquette of the theatre having been floored&#xD;
over to make a large ballroom.&#xD;
At midnight the Mistic Krewe suddenly and&#xD;
mysteriously disappeared, each deity returning&#xD;
ito the realm from which it had been called.&#xD;
In the gay and happy throng that filled theft&#xD;
walls of the old theatre, the most select, re-I&#xD;
fined and fashionable company that could bd&#xD;
chosen in the Crescent City, Philip and Mary&#xD;
were much admired and spoken of as among&#xD;
the most charming couples gathered there.&#xD;
This was in the palmy days of our Southern&#xD;
metropolis,' when the people were in the full&#xD;
tide of success, smrrotuided by wealth and&#xD;
comfort, elegance and refinement, and they&#xD;
were abcustomned to do well whatever they&#xD;
undertook, especially was it so in matters per-&#xD;
taining to the social circle. Their friends and&#xD;
the strangers who went amongst them were&#xD;
received with open hands and open doors, and&#xD;
welcomed with a profuse and heart-felt hospi-&#xD;
tality, not surpassed in any part of the world,&#xD;
and this was done without ostentation or any&#xD;
attempt at display. .&#xD;
After the young folks had enjoyed them-&#xD;
selves for an hour or two, Mr. McDonald mnt-&#xD;
mated that it was time to return home. Mr.&#xD;
Macourty gathered together his friends, and,&#xD;
with Philip and Carl Amber as an additional&#xD;
escort, they retired from the happy scene.&#xD;
After going home with the folks, Carl and&#xD;
Philip consulted together and concluded to re-&#xD;
turn to the theatre and join in the festivities&#xD;
for an hour or two longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
The company at the Gaieties Theatre ,was&#xD;
yet in the enjoyment and excitement of the&#xD;
dance, the brilliant assemblage and the soul-&#xD;
enchamting music, when Philip rejoined the&#xD;
merry throng and entered into the pleasures of&#xD;
the hour. In the -interval between the sets,&#xD;
when the night had nearly passed away, Mr.&#xD;
MacVain came to him and inghtired if he was&#xD;
engaged for the next dance, Philip was&#xD;
struck with the unusual palor of his friend's&#xD;
countenance and his look of firmness and de-&#xD;
termination.&#xD;
" I am not, Mr. MacVain," he replied, won-&#xD;
dering at the other's manner.&#xD;
"I want a friend ; will you go with me ?" in-&#xD;
quired his friend.&#xD;
" Certaitily, Mr. MacVain ; what is the mat-&#xD;
'ter I" .&#xD;
S"Without making any reply, Mr. MacVain&#xD;
~Ied the way, and Philip followed to the roomu&#xD;
(occupied by the former, nothing being said' by&#xD;
either during their walk. The rooms were&#xD;
lighted up and a fire burned in the grate, for&#xD;
thie night had become chilly. On the table an&#xD;
open case of duelling pistols was laying. ' '&#xD;
" These look like they might do work," said&#xD;
Philip, taking one of the pistols from the case,.&#xD;
")They are intended for that," Mr. MacVain&#xD;
quietly replied.  .,&#xD;
"Sir' "&#xD;
" The fact is, Philip,'" said Mr. MacVain, " I&#xD;
have a meeting with Mr. Plant at six o'clock&#xD;
this morning, at the 'Oaks, aud I want you to&#xD;
be my second."&#xD;
" A meeting ! What is it about V" exclaimed&#xD;
Philip.      .--&#xD;
" A quarrel at the Club yesterday," replied&#xD;
Mr. MacVain. 'A He dared to sped~k insultingly&#xD;
of Miss McDonald, words ensued,,he threw&#xD;
wine on me and I knocked him down. He sent&#xD;
his partner, Mr. Cotton, to me, and the meet-&#xD;
ing was arranged." .&#xD;
" Which must niot take place," said Philip,&#xD;
"he insulted Miss McDonald, and, therefore,&#xD;
the quarrel is mine. I will keep the appoint-&#xD;
ment."&#xD;
" That would never do, Philip."&#xD;
"Yes, i1t is the correct way of settling this&#xD;
matter."&#xD;
"It will not do," replied Mr. MacVain firmly.&#xD;
"Give up that idea; come, promise me to give&#xD;
it up."&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
12.t&#xD;
&#xD;
''Bt Mr. MacVain, I am the one most in'&#xD;
terested."&#xD;
"It is my quarrel and mine only, Philip.&#xD;
Promise me, as a friend, that you will not in-&#xD;
&#xD;
terfere or try to provoke another meeting with&#xD;
this man.".&#xD;
"Since you are so positive against it, I yield,"&#xD;
reluctantly replied Philip-.&#xD;
"Very well, I thank you for it," said Mr.'&#xD;
.laeVain, "now you can act as my man. You&#xD;
will find my will in that box," he contimuedl,&#xD;
pointing to a fancy box standing on the "What&#xD;
Not," i.n the corner, " and I desire, Philip, that&#xD;
you will put my body in a vault util your can&#xD;
build a tomb, and then remove it to that."&#xD;
" Your body! pray don't .talk so," said&#xD;
Philip.&#xD;
" Yes ; I should like to lie beneath the old&#xD;
sod, but then 'that cannot be, and, if it were&#xD;
possible - what would be the satisfaction-&#xD;
since there's no one there now that would re&#xD;
umeinber or care for me; no, no, it's better here&#xD;
and then there'll be sonme one to look after the&#xD;
placece"&#xD;
"My dear friend," said Philip,. with true&#xD;
'feeling, " don't be, so down-hearted and sad&#xD;
it will all come out right."&#xD;
"Iam not afraid to die, Philip," said Mr-.&#xD;
Ma cVan wth erghisee'        urigwt&#xD;
the excitement of the time. I can m eet himh&#xD;
as caln and composed as if I did not know it&#xD;
wvou eom.ld be fatal to me.&#xD;
'' It will not be fatal to you," replied Philip,&#xD;
" you are too good a shot, you will have it all&#xD;
your own way."&#xD;
" Skill and nerve will avail nothing against&#xD;
destiny," said Mr. MacVain-.        .&#xD;
S"My dear sir, you are too down-dast," said&#xD;
Philip, going towards the side-board, '" come,&#xD;
take something to strengthen your nerves."&#xD;
"I tell you, Philip, I am not nervous or&#xD;
down-hearted," replid Mr. MacVain. "Feel&#xD;
my pulse; would a coward's beat so regular as&#xD;
that No-it is destiny-"&#xD;
," I do not understand you," said Philip.&#xD;
" Listen. Our family, like all the old&#xD;
families of Ireland, is followed by the Ban-&#xD;
shee, or death warning-"~ commenced Mr. Mac..&#xD;
Vain.&#xD;
"Do you believe in such superstitions P" in-&#xD;
quired Philip, interrupting him.&#xD;
"19elieve ! I know it," replied Mr. MacVain,&#xD;
firmly. " Look at me. I am not ignorant, nor&#xD;
&#xD;
foolish, nor yet superstitious, but I know what&#xD;
I have seen! When the troubles occurred.&#xD;
that drove me from Ireland, I left my mother&#xD;
there and came here, where I was soon engaged&#xD;
in business. Going into the yard of my store&#xD;
one morning, I saw my mother there, saw her&#xD;
as plain and looking as natural as I now' see&#xD;
you.' I returned to my office and told my&#xD;
cashier of what I had seen, and that I knew it&#xD;
meant my mother's leath. In time I received&#xD;
letters from home, informing me of the' 'sad&#xD;
event, which occurred at the very moment that&#xD;
the apparition had visited me."&#xD;
"Very singular, -indeed," Philip 'remarked.&#xD;
" Last night, or rather, night before last, for&#xD;
it is now nearly morning," continued Mr.&#xD;
MacVain, " as I sat here in my room, without&#xD;
a thought of my mother or home, I looked up&#xD;
from a reverie about you and Miss McDonald,&#xD;
and standing there by the fire-place, was my&#xD;
mother, just as I have seen her many and many&#xD;
a time in the years gone by ; but there was a&#xD;
look of sorrow and anguish on her face that&#xD;
was painful to see. I knew then that I would&#xD;
soon end mny earthly career, and, therefore, at&#xD;
once drew up the will which you will find in&#xD;
the box yonder.''&#xD;
" This vision is susceptible of many, inter-&#xD;
pretations," replied Philip, "as, for instance-''&#xD;
" Enough, enough, I know what it meant&#xD;
and that is sufficient," said Mr. MacVain.&#xD;
Now we will have some coffee and prepare for&#xD;
the grounds, for I must be there punctual to&#xD;
the minute."&#xD;
Not much was said during their morning&#xD;
lunch for which Philip had no appetite,&#xD;
having eaten during the night, and the new&#xD;
position in which he found himself, made him&#xD;
feel nervous and excitable. Not so with Mr.&#xD;
MacVain ; having completed his directions to&#xD;
hid young friend he was perfectly cool and col-&#xD;
lected. Het took the refreshments with a relish&#xD;
and then lighted a cigar, which he seemed to&#xD;
enjoy, leaning back in his chair and convers-&#xD;
ing with Philip on his approaching union with&#xD;
Miss McDonald.&#xD;
As they drove along the shell road in a cab&#xD;
towards the meeting grounds, they came up&#xD;
with another cab. in which were seated Mr&#xD;
Plant and his friend Mr. Cotton. Side by side&#xD;
they drove along, neither manifesting an in-&#xD;
decent hast to lead the other, nor an inclina-&#xD;
tion to lag behind.&#xD;

A TALE OF ANTE )?ELLZJM ~                    127                   MARDI GRAS;&#xD;
&#xD;
Arrived on the ground, Mr. Cotton and&#xD;
Philip held a short consultation, measured off&#xD;
thp ground, exainihed the weapons and placed&#xD;
their men. A solemn stillness folloWed,&#xD;
which was broken by Mr. Cotton, who came&#xD;
forward, and, addressing Philip where Mr.&#xD;
MacVain could hear him, said: ' Mr. Cum-&#xD;
inings, your principal has grossly insulted my&#xD;
friend, Mr. Plant, and, unless an apology is of-&#xD;
fered, the matter must proceed in ~e usual&#xD;
course.".&#xD;
"I have no apology to offer," replied Mr*&#xD;
MacVain, turning sharply on the speaker,&#xD;
"your message is one based on gross false-&#xD;
hood. Tell Mr. 1~Iant that I will allow this&#xD;
matter to stop only on condition that he shall&#xD;
at once make the proper retraction due me,&#xD;
and that in a place as public as that in which&#xD;
the insult was given."&#xD;
"That settles the matter sir; we mi~y as&#xD;
well proceed to business," said Mr. Cotton.&#xD;
"I am waiting," was the cool reply.&#xD;
It fell to Philip to call time, and, in a voice&#xD;
tremulous with the excitement of the occasion,&#xD;
he demanded: "Gentlemen, are you ready ~&#xD;
To which both firmly replied, "Ready."&#xD;
Then the command from Philip came, clear&#xD;
and distinct:&#xD;
"Fire! One, two, three 1"&#xD;
At the word one the report of Mr. Plant's&#xD;
shot was heard, followed by that of Mr. Mac-&#xD;
Vain's at the next word of command, and the&#xD;
smoke from both floated off on the clear mOrn-&#xD;
jug as "three" was called.&#xD;
The seconds hurried to their friends. Mr.&#xD;
Plant said as Mr. Cotton came up: "Here,&#xD;
let's get back to town; i've fixed him."&#xD;
"Arc you hurt 1" inquired Mr. Cotton.&#xD;
"No! He made a clean miss of it-but Idid&#xD;
not," he replied.&#xD;
~They returned to their cab and started. for&#xD;
tl~e city without paying any attention to the&#xD;
ot~er part of the field. As soon as the oem-&#xD;
maud was finished, Mr. MacVain turned to&#xD;
Pl~ilip, who hastened forward and inquired,&#xD;
"Are you wounded, sir V'&#xD;
~'Yes. I fear badly-we must hurry back,"&#xD;
Mr. MacVain's repI~.&#xD;
Without asking further questions, Philip ac-&#xD;
co~npanied him to their cab and assisted his&#xD;
friend in, who said to the driver: "flurry,&#xD;
my good fellow, drive as fast as you can."&#xD;
The driver, half frightened at what had oc-&#xD;
&#xD;
128&#xD;
&#xD;
curred, put the horse to his highest speed, and&#xD;
never relaxed in his urging the animal until he&#xD;
stopped in front of Mr. MacVain's lodgings.&#xD;
The wounded man was too weak from loss of&#xD;
blood to get out, but the driver assisted Philip&#xD;
and together they carried him in and placed&#xD;
him on a sofa.&#xD;
"Go get a doctor at once," said Philip to&#xD;
the driver, who started off immediately to&#xD;
obey the order.&#xD;
"Bring George Macourty here, Philip," said&#xD;
Mr. MacVain in a week but anxious voice,&#xD;
"tell him to come at once."&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I'll go directly."&#xD;
"Go now, Philip, at once-quick, quick !"&#xD;
"IBut, sir, I must not leave you," replied&#xD;
Philip.&#xD;
"Do ~'t think of me; go immediately-half&#xD;
an hour\ and you may be too late."&#xD;
Philip called in the landlady of the house,&#xD;
and, ste ping into the first cab he saw, told&#xD;
the own r to drive away as fast as he could.&#xD;
* Mr. M county was preparing to go to busi&#xD;
ness, an was much surprised to see his confi-&#xD;
dential man in such a state of excitement.&#xD;
When Philip briefly related what; had taken&#xD;
place, h made no delay in accompanying him&#xD;
to the r sidenee of the wounded man. At the&#xD;
door they met the doctOr, who answered their&#xD;
inquiries very decidedly. '~He cannot live&#xD;
through the day. The wound was mortal from&#xD;
the start, and he may die at any minute."&#xD;
When Mr. Macourty entered the room, Phil~-&#xD;
remained in the hall, leaving the two alone to-&#xD;
gether.&#xD;
Speaking with difficulty, and often pausing&#xD;
to gather strength, Mr. MacVain at once, fully&#xD;
and without prevarication, told Mr Macourty&#xD;
how he had stolen his little daughter sixteen&#xD;
years before, that his object had been revenge,&#xD;
that he had given her to Sarah Murray, to be&#xD;
taken to New York, his intention being to re-&#xD;
turn the child again to her parents. Thea fol-&#xD;
lowed an account of Sarah's death without&#xD;
leaving any trace of the child, and his own&#xD;
long, exhausting and frt~itless search for her.&#xD;
The surprise and horror of the good man at&#xD;
learning that one whom he had cherished as a&#xD;
friend had been his greatest enemy, wa~ very&#xD;
great.&#xD;
"I cannot expect you to forgive me," said&#xD;
Mr. MacVain, in conclusion. "I hi~ve done you&#xD;
an irreparable injury, and have nothing to say&#xD;
in extenuation of my conduct, but I assure you&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
that that one act has been the bane and~ load.&#xD;
stone of my whole life. Since it was commit.&#xD;
ed, and I began to realize the terrible wrong&#xD;
had done, there has never been a time&#xD;
when I would not have willingly forfeited my&#xD;
life to have redeemed the error and requited&#xD;
the injury against you and yours."&#xD;
"I am terribly disappointed in you, Percy,&#xD;
for if there was one man that I loved and re&#xD;
spected more than all others in my circle of&#xD;
friends, it was you," Mr. Macourty replied,&#xD;
"but may God forgive you-as I will try to&#xD;
do; and now that you have made all the repa-&#xD;
ration for this great wrong, that lies in your&#xD;
power to make, you must see one of the Fa-&#xD;
tAers and' try to make your peace with that&#xD;
Judge before whom you will soon appear. -&#xD;
"I'll think of it, George-I'll-" he looked&#xD;
around, and his friend was gone.&#xD;
Mr. Macourty soon returned with a priest,&#xD;
one who, by long years of devotion, had en-&#xD;
deared himself to the people of the parish, and&#xD;
by ceaseless, untiring energy, had built up St.&#xD;
Patrick's Church and placed it in the front&#xD;
rank amongst the churches of the country.&#xD;
Their conference was long, and when it was&#xD;
over, the reverend Father came out, his coun-&#xD;
tenance beaming with pleasure, for his task&#xD;
had been well performed and his labors&#xD;
crowned with success.&#xD;
ChAPTER XXXVII.&#xD;
Philip remained to attend to Mr. MacVain,&#xD;
and do what he could to make his situation&#xD;
comfortable. Very little conversation passed&#xD;
between them; the wounded man seemed to&#xD;
prefer communing with his own thoughts, and,&#xD;
therefore, Philip avoided distracting him by&#xD;
introducing subjects which, as most, were only&#xD;
of passing interest, The city soon caught the&#xD;
rumor ~f the duel, and it was repeated in a&#xD;
hundred different ways. One report was that&#xD;
a duel had been fought between Plant and&#xD;
Ma~Vain, in which the latter was instantly&#xD;
kifted, and, some words having passed between&#xD;
the seconds, that Philip Cummings had been&#xD;
mo tally wounded. Another insisted that&#xD;
hot Plant and MacVain were killed on the&#xD;
Ipo ; and yet another that both of the princi-&#xD;
pals as well as their two friends, were mortal-&#xD;
ly wounded. As to the cause of the meeting&#xD;
&#xD;
the reports were equally varied and unreliable.&#xD;
Some said it was about a c~rnsignment of cot--&#xD;
ton, which Mr. MacVain claimed should have-&#xD;
been sent to him, but that, as it had been re-&#xD;
ceived by Mr. Plant's house, Mr. MacVain&#xD;
claimed that they ought to reserve enough of&#xD;
the proceeds to pay the balance due him from&#xD;
the shipper. Others asserted that the quarrel&#xD;
originated in a game of cards, and others that&#xD;
it was an old affair recently renewed by acci-&#xD;
dent.&#xD;
Mr. Plant appeared at the Cl~rb at his usual&#xD;
hour, and for the time forgot his haughty ~e--&#xD;
serve and cold formality, to give a minute and&#xD;
rather boastful account of thu meeting, and&#xD;
many of his hearers felt a cold chill pass over&#xD;
them as he told, with the utmost 8augfroicl, the&#xD;
particulars of his aim, and gaveitashisopinion&#xD;
that his antagonist could notlive for four and&#xD;
twenty hours. His company was shunned and&#xD;
there were few respectable men who would&#xD;
have any social intercourse with him.&#xD;
Mrs. Mucourty was much surprised at the&#xD;
news brought by her husband, which opened&#xD;
~new the grief of past years, and raised a hope&#xD;
in her heart that her lost darling would-yet be~&#xD;
found. Her husband immediately wrote to the&#xD;
New York detectives, Williams and Bodkers,&#xD;
and the search was once more renewed. Mr.&#xD;
Macourty and his wife agreed, however, that&#xD;
they would say nothing amongst their friencis&#xD;
about Mr. MacVain's confession, as it would&#xD;
damage his character and reputation without&#xD;
being of any service to them, and, as Mr. Ma-&#xD;
courty said, "he has been a good man in many&#xD;
respects, and it becomes us, as Christians, to-&#xD;
let him die in peace.'&#xD;
The priest returned in the afternoon and re-&#xD;
mained with the dying man, comforting him&#xD;
with good counsel, aiding him in his prayers&#xD;
and administering to him the last sacraments&#xD;
of the Chuich. There the good man remained&#xD;
until all was over, and ~he eyes of the ~gifted&#xD;
and accomplished MacVain were forever closed&#xD;
in death.&#xD;
The long shadows were falling in tee city,&#xD;
as the sun retired on his westward course, and&#xD;
the bell of old St. Patrick's was pealing forth&#xD;
-the sweet notes of t~O Angelus on that calm,&#xD;
beautiful Ash Wednesday evening, when his&#xD;
immortal spirit left the perishable tenement&#xD;
of day, that had held it prisoner heie o~&#xD;
earth.&#xD;

The news of Mr. MacVain's death was soon&#xD;
known in business circles, and many of his&#xD;
old associates, the merchants and wealthy men&#xD;
of the city, called to assist in laying him out&#xD;
~snd preparing for the last sad attentions to&#xD;
their friend.&#xD;
At the funeral, on the following day, there&#xD;
was a very large turnout; the old business men&#xD;
who ~ad been connected with the deceased in&#xD;
ainny commercial transactions, young men&#xD;
who had been assisted and encouraged by him,&#xD;
hundreds of poor people, who remembered,&#xD;
with gratitude, the band that had ever been&#xD;
extended for their relief, and never empty;&#xD;
many from the ever green Isle, who esteemed&#xD;
him as one who had always upbeld~the honor&#xD;
and reputation of their loved laud, and was&#xD;
ever proud of his nativity; men of science and&#xD;
culturee, who had recognized in him an equal&#xD;
and co-laborer; they were all there, viewing&#xD;
with each other in doing honor to the dead.&#xD;
The arrangements and ceremonies were all con-&#xD;
ducted according to instructions he had given&#xD;
before his death.&#xD;
On the following day Mr. MacVain's will was&#xD;
read in the pre ence of his confidential clerks,&#xD;
Wayland, Thomas and Ballarie, and Philip, Mr.&#xD;
Macourty and Mr. McDonald, who were called&#xD;
in, in pursuance of a wish expressed by the&#xD;
deceased, after the fatal duel.&#xD;
The document commenced with the state-&#xD;
ment that he owed no debts and had no rela-&#xD;
tives living. There was a respectable list of&#xD;
bequests for charitable purposes, and another&#xD;
to faithful servants and some poor friends.&#xD;
Then there was a suitable reward to Williams&#xD;
and Bodkers, for their services, followed by a&#xD;
legacy of teu thousand dollars to "Cecelia&#xD;
Benson, formerly a match girl in New York&#xD;
citv," the same to be advertised for a reason-&#xD;
able length of. time, and, if the girl was not&#xD;
then found, the amount was to be divided&#xD;
between the parties of the two classes before&#xD;
mentioned.&#xD;
This surprised some of the bearers, who were&#xD;
snot aware of Mr. MacVain's long search for&#xD;
Cecelia an the reasons that prompted it.&#xD;
Felix Le C asseaux was delighted with his&#xD;
good fortune , and was now confirmed in the&#xD;
belief that is wife was a great personage.&#xD;
The will concluded with the following&#xD;
clauses:&#xD;
"I direct t at my commission business shall&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
jie immediately settled up, and a balance sheet&#xD;
taken, so that the amount of capital invested&#xD;
therein may be definitely ascertained.&#xD;
"My business as a commission merchant, I&#xD;
give and bequeath to Albert Wayland, William&#xD;
Thomas and Paul Ballarie, who have been, for&#xD;
~any years, my faithful clerks, and kind, true&#xD;
friends. I desire that they shall form a co-&#xD;
partnership and divide their profits equally&#xD;
amongst themselves, and, in order to enable&#xD;
them to continue the business with profit and&#xD;
without embarrassment, Idirect that they shall&#xD;
have the use and control of the capital now&#xD;
invested in the business, for the terni of five&#xD;
years, without interest or charges, at the end&#xD;
of which time they shall pay over the said&#xD;
amount to my executors hereinafter mentioned.&#xD;
"I direct that, after paying the before men-&#xD;
tioned amounts, all of .my property, real and&#xD;
personal, bonds, stocks an4 mortgages, Of&#xD;
whatsoever nature or description, shall be di-&#xD;
vided into two equal portions. One of the said&#xD;
undivided portions or halves of my estate I&#xD;
give and bequeath to my young friend, Mr.&#xD;
Philip Cummings, son of the late Poter Cum-&#xD;
mings, Esq.&#xD;
"And the remaining undivided portion or&#xD;
half of my estate I give and bequeath to Miss&#xD;
Mary McDonald, adopted daughter of my es-&#xD;
teemed friend, Robt. McDonald, Esq., of this&#xD;
city.&#xD;
"For the faithful execution of my Inst ~viil&#xD;
and testament, I appoint as my executors and&#xD;
administrators, with full power to act, in all&#xD;
matters, as may seem best in their judgment,&#xD;
my friends, George Mac ourty and Robert Mc-&#xD;
Donald, Esqrs., of this city.&#xD;
"With a full belief in the justice and power&#xD;
of Almighty God, and in humble reliance on&#xD;
His mercy, this document is executed, by my&#xD;
hand, in the city of New Orleans, this fifteenth&#xD;
day of February, A. 1)., eighteen hundred and&#xD;
fifty-eight.        PERCY MACVAIN."&#xD;
Profound silence had been observed during&#xD;
the reading of this document, with the provis-&#xD;
ions of which every one seemed perfectly satis-&#xD;
fied. Immediately steps were taken to carry&#xD;
out the wishes of the deceased, and, in a few&#xD;
days, the new sign of Wayland, Thom,~s &amp;amp;&#xD;
Ballarie, replaced the one that had so long&#xD;
hung there, and had been for many years fa-&#xD;
miliar and respected throughout a large per-&#xD;
tion of the planting district of the S~uthern&#xD;
country.&#xD;

CIIAPTEII xxxV~II.&#xD;
The Easter holidays brought a season of&#xD;
mirth and pleasure, which the people, released&#xD;
from the vigils and fasts of Lent, enjoyed with&#xD;
great zest. The mysteries of Holy Thursday,&#xD;
the awful gloom of Good Friday, and the aol-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
A ~PALE OF A~NTE BELJUM TIMES.&#xD;
&#xD;
ilLlrL4 ThAt&#xD;
&#xD;
emn ceremonies of Holy Saturday, increased&#xD;
and brought to a close the sorrow and. mourn2&#xD;
ing of the Church and her children; a feeling&#xD;
of sadness and awe that had pervaded the&#xD;
whole city, almost entirely suspending, not&#xD;
only social pleasures, but conirnercial transac-&#xD;
tions. The overhanging darkness of the close&#xD;
of Lent gave additional interest and eclat to the&#xD;
brightness and joy of Easter Sunday, when the&#xD;
altars of the churches were decorated with all&#xD;
the ornaments and with grand floral offerings,&#xD;
rendered brilliant with the light of so many&#xD;
candles, when canticles of praise to God aiid&#xD;
love and joy for m~ risen Saviour, were chanted&#xD;
forth by the choir and filled all hearts with&#xD;
pleasing emotions.&#xD;
The day appointed for the union of Philip&#xD;
Cummings and Mary MoDona~d was now near&#xD;
it hand, and all the friends of the couple were&#xD;
busy with preparations and nervous with&#xD;
anxiety about the coming event.&#xD;
Mrs. Macourty claimed Philip as a son, and&#xD;
~~as engaged in seeing that he was properly&#xD;
equipped for the occasion and drilled in his&#xD;
share of the ceremonies, which is sufficient&#xD;
guarantee that he was well taken care of.&#xD;
The bride and bride's maids were inflicted&#xD;
with a course of visitiut~ and receiving, order-&#xD;
ing and directing, dress makers and milliners,&#xD;
and the fitting, changing, altering and imnprov-&#xD;
ing, would have puzzled an uninitiated person&#xD;
to follow, without turning their brain and&#xD;
giving a lasting headache.&#xD;
But the ladies did not mind it-in fact, they&#xD;
rather liked it! It was frequently discovered&#xD;
that everything was ruined! This was cut too I&#xD;
short, that too long, and something else too&#xD;
narrow or too wide! Of one article there was&#xD;
too much and of another too little, and it was&#xD;
quite a certain thing that Gircaux would not ~&#xD;
get their white satin slippers done in time! C&#xD;
But all these difficulties disappeared before 1&#xD;
the energy and perseverance of the fair ladies t&#xD;
and their accomplished assistants.&#xD;
There was to be a mptial High M~iss at St. ~&#xD;
Patrick's Church, at eight o'clock in the morn-&#xD;
ing, and a gathering of friends at Mr. MoDon- 5&#xD;
aid's in bhe evening, after which the young a&#xD;
couple were to go to their now home, a hand-&#xD;
some dwelling ~, with large grounds, in the ~&#xD;
upper part of the city. The invitations to both ~&#xD;
a&#xD;
the church and the house were numerous. b&#xD;
Philip knew everybody and everybody liked V&#xD;
&#xD;
i2~i&#xD;
&#xD;
him, and the bride's family was one of the&#xD;
first in the city, so that the "oldf~milies," tho&#xD;
solid folks and staid old rcspectalAes were nIl&#xD;
on hand to honor the occasion. TLo church&#xD;
was crowded, and everyone was arixious to&#xD;
"see how they would look."&#xD;
At last the exciting moment came, and the&#xD;
procession moved up the center isle, Philip,&#xD;
with Mrs. Macourty coming first, followed by&#xD;
Mary, leaning on Mr. McDonald's arm; Annie&#xD;
Macourty with Carl Amber, followed by Welly&#xD;
Cheerful with Lewis Fontaine, Mrs. McDonald&#xD;
and Mr. Macourty, followed by ten or fifteen&#xD;
couples, old and young, particular friends of&#xD;
the families.&#xD;
The ceremonies were beautiful and impres-&#xD;
sive, and at their close friends came forward&#xD;
and congratulated the happy couple.&#xD;
Philip then led his young bride dowa the&#xD;
grand. isle, followed by the others of the bri-&#xD;
dal party, and a large crowd of friends. After&#xD;
again receiving good wishes and heart-felt&#xD;
blessings from numerous friends at the en-&#xD;
trance of the Church, the party entered the&#xD;
carriages in waiting and drove away.&#xD;
When the friends had returned to Mr. Mc-&#xD;
Donald'sand were gathered in the parlor, Mrs.&#xD;
McDonald embraced Philip and giving himii a&#xD;
hearty kiss welcomed him as her son.&#xD;
"You have my treasure, Philip," she said&#xD;
' she has been always a good daughter which&#xD;
[s the best of guarantees that she will make a&#xD;
;ood wife, but you are welcome Philip with&#xD;
ne, as a son."&#xD;
"Thank you, my good, kind mother," ho re-&#xD;
lied, "I shalt endeavor to hear well and truly&#xD;
he name of s~n to you, and that will include&#xD;
)eing a good husband to her."&#xD;
"Philip---m son, you are already dear to us&#xD;
~nd I am surd that coming years will only in-&#xD;
rease the feeling,"~ said Mr. McDonald, warm-&#xD;
y shaking the young man's hand, then turning&#xD;
o his wife, sitid, "and now let us have some&#xD;
breakfast for I am sure the young folks are&#xD;
nngry-if they are not I am."&#xD;
"Mary, I have always cherished Philip as a&#xD;
ofi," said Mrs. Macourty, kissing the bride&#xD;
nd holding her hand lovingly in her own,&#xD;
~andI therefore claim yeu as a daughter, I&#xD;
iced scarcely tell you that you will always be&#xD;
welcome in our home, for since I first saw you,&#xD;
~y heart has opened to you and I have almost&#xD;
eon disposed to contest with my good friend&#xD;
he title of mother, when speaking of you."&#xD;
17&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC8171-00000066"/>&#xD;
As this was said in an earnest, loving man-&#xD;
ncr the friends around were deeply moved,&#xD;
and Carl Amber, touching Mrs McDonald,&#xD;
said, "Di4 you ever see such a striking like-&#xD;
ness between strangers before ~"&#xD;
"Our Mary in her bridal costume," said Mr.&#xD;
McDonald to his wife, "looks just as Mrs. Ma-&#xD;
courty did the day that we saw George and&#xD;
her married. Don't it seem so to you I"&#xD;
"Yes, it does, indeed," she replied.&#xD;
Mary returned Mrs. Macourty's embrace&#xD;
with much feeling and began to reply but sud-&#xD;
denly paused, and looked steadily at he&#xD;
friend.&#xD;
"Your kindness to me, and this assurance&#xD;
of your love fills my heart too full for words&#xD;
to give an idea or the happiness I now feel, I&#xD;
knoiv that time-"&#xD;
"What Is It Mary-are you sick I" anxious-&#xD;
ly inquired Mrs. Macourty, as Mary continued&#xD;
silent.&#xD;
"No, no, not at all," Mary replied, hastily,&#xD;
"I feel very well."&#xD;
Philip and the other friends came forward&#xD;
when they heard Mrs. Macourty's question,&#xD;
and Mary felt embarrassed at their anxious&#xD;
faces, but gathering courage, she said smiling.&#xD;
"It was nothing-I was-the cross you wear-&#xD;
it is very handsome."&#xD;
"I will give it to you, Mary," replied Mrs.&#xD;
Macourty, taking off the ornamenii, and har~d-&#xD;
ing it to her, 'rand in doing so, I give you a&#xD;
gem which I prize above all others, for it was&#xD;
worn by my little daughter when she was&#xD;

"Can it he-are my' hopes at last to be real-&#xD;
Ized 1" exclaimed Mary.&#xD;
Mary, what do mean I" Philip anxiously&#xD;
inquired.&#xD;
Mary took the cross and examined it closely,&#xD;
while the varying expressions of her face,&#xD;
showed the deep emotions that filled her heart&#xD;
and were with difficulty subdued&#xD;
"When my mother was dying in Brooklyn,"&#xD;
she said to Philip, i~hile all present listened&#xD;
with intense interest, "she whom you knew as&#xD;
my mother, and she was always kind and lov-&#xD;
ing to me, she called me to her and told me&#xD;
that she was not my mother, this scene I re-&#xD;
lated to our kind friends here when they un~&#xD;
dertook the care of me, and assumed the posi-&#xD;
'tions of mother and father, which they have&#xD;
so kindly filled."&#xD;
&#xD;
130)&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes, yes, I remember it all, Mary, dear,"&#xD;
said Mr. McDonald.&#xD;
"I knew not who my parents were," contin-&#xD;
ued Mary, "for Mrs. Collins could tell me no&#xD;
more, than that I had been stolen from my&#xD;
home, and given to Sarah Murray, who died&#xD;
when I was quite young, and the only evi-&#xD;
dence that remained was this cross, bearing&#xD;
~the initials of my mothers' maiden name-here&#xD;
you see them C. M. C."&#xD;
Friends stood mute with surprise at this&#xD;
sudden discovery of one so long mourned as&#xD;
lost, but when Mrs. Macourty threw her arms&#xD;
around Mary's neck, and covered her face with&#xD;
kisses, the ladies and children laughed and&#xD;
cried in turns, while the gentlemen shook&#xD;
hands with each other, and hastily wiped&#xD;
away the tears that would come in spite of&#xD;
manhood and an effort at serenity.&#xD;
Mr. Macourty embraced his daughter, and&#xD;
feelingly expressed the joy he felt at her dis-&#xD;
covery.&#xD;
"I knew there was something that drew me&#xD;
to you," said Annie, embracing her sister af-&#xD;
fectionately, "for when I first saw you I loved&#xD;
you, there was a secret charm that bound my&#xD;
heart that I could not understand. Then&#xD;
when you were going to marry Philip, I&#xD;
thought it might be that, for I always loved&#xD;
him, "and she cast a merry, roguish look at&#xD;
Philip, who was as proud and happy as it was&#xD;
possible to be.&#xD;
"Why did yen part with this precious me-&#xD;
mento of your lost home I" inquired Mr. Ma-&#xD;
courty, when they had all become more calm.&#xD;
"You remember our kind friend Peter&#xD;
Droll," she said to Philip, "it is to him that I&#xD;
owe my education, he was to me~a kind and&#xD;
indulgent friend, a brother or a father could&#xD;
not have been more so."&#xD;
"I know it well," replied Philip, "poor&#xD;
Uncle Peter, he sleeps beneath the waves of&#xD;
the Atlantic."&#xD;
"Yes-bat we thought-everybody said,&#xD;
that a trip to his home in Scotland would re-&#xD;
store his broken health," she sadly replied, .s&#xD;
she remembered how disappointed she had&#xD;
been in that hope, "and ho said that when lie&#xD;

&#xD;
Thy bells are chiming&#xD;
While I am rhyming, .&#xD;
And the sound floats out from thy befry high,&#xD;
And awakens feelings&#xD;
0O' the days and dealings '&#xD;
That have left us memories that can never die;&#xD;
For with each vibration&#xD;
Comes a fond creation -&#xD;
To some one listening to thy pleasant sound,&#xD;
And tender measures each fond heart treasures&#xD;
Of scenes that passed on thy sacred ground.&#xD;
'Tis of hours in childhood,&#xD;
Ere care or blight could .&#xD;
Within the bosom find home or rest,&#xD;
Of fis comunion,&#xD;
With infant purity sp sweet and blest,&#xD;
And memory sadly&#xD;
Recalls how gladly&#xD;
The heart respondedito thy bell's loud call&#xD;
On that bright mornifig when He, adorning.&#xD;
The soul with virtues, showed His love to all.&#xD;
'Tis of manhood's vigor&#xD;
When war's stern rigor&#xD;
Called son and sire to the fatal stri , -&#xD;
And bugle hailing&#xD;
Awoke sad wailing -&#xD;
In hearts, though country was moe e dear than&#xD;
life;&#xD;
But with the grieving&#xD;
For the loved ones leaving&#xD;
There came a sound from thy turret gray&#xD;
Which 'said, "Young soldier, the brave are&#xD;
bolder,,&#xD;
If first their homage to God they p ."&#xD;
And in hour of battle,&#xD;
When cannon's rattle,&#xD;
And 'flash of muskets, and leaden shower,&#xD;
And hollow death groan, .&#xD;
Or lips last low npoan,&#xD;
Gave fearful record of death's revel hour,&#xD;
Some ring of saber,&#xD;
In that hour's stern labor,&#xD;
Amid the din, echoed like thy chimes,&#xD;
And the dying listened, and his glazed eye&#xD;
glistened,&#xD;
For the sound brought comfort from the bygone&#xD;
times.&#xD;

used. It does perfect work long after Machines of other manufacturers have&#xD;
become worthless. It sews finer and coarser goods, is quieter and quicker in its&#xD;
movements, using less thread, and requires less exertion on the part of the opera-&#xD;
tor than any other Sewing Machine. It is the only Sewing Machine a lady can&#xD;
use without injury to her health, as the goods are carried directly forward and away&#xD;
from the operator, and does not require the sitting in a stooped position, like&#xD;
other Machines, to guide the work.&#xD;
Compare the sewing done by it on leather, cloth, linen, Swiss muslin, or any&#xD;
other goods, with (the sewing by other Machines on like material, and the verdict&#xD;
will be that ,the "SINGER " is the only perfect SEWING MACHINE in&#xD;
