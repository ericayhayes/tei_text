PREFACE.&#xD;
&#xD;
If any one should open this book with the expec-&#xD;
tation of finding it. a novel, he. will simply be dis-&#xD;
appointed; I might regret such disappointment, but&#xD;
I cannot' regret that this is not a novel, in the idea&#xD;
which that word-conveys to the popular understand-&#xD;
ing, There is but one consideration in view of which&#xD;
I could admit such a designation: The book contains&#xD;
some novel things ;-though nog the less true, as I&#xD;
believe, for their novelty.&#xD;
If the regular novel-makers----those who construct&#xD;
from an esthetic impulse, without regard to moral&#xD;
tendencies,-should laugh at my plot an#&#xD;
agement, they are at prfect liberty to&#xD;
should have ample satisfaction of all se1nt&#xD;
that I have never found time to read toh&#xD;
or three of their works. What litle approaches 4 e&#xD;
dramatic in this book, came, in the first place, unnd&#xD;
den and unlooked for; butwhen it came, itwas web.&#xD;
  corned, and more followed by design. It has served&#xD;
my purpose, and that is all .I could wish.  J. P.&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
THE PROFESSIONS.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHARLES HOPEWELL and his sister MARYa were both&#xD;
young; the one about twenty-two, the other twenty.&#xD;
They were orphan children, and having been left&#xD;
with a small legacy, were compelled,  rely upon&#xD;
their own energies for the means of l. They had&#xD;
the wide world before them, and a hng future i&#xD;
prospect, but with true hearts and able hands, tg&#xD;
did not hesitate to enter the arena of industrial strif.&#xD;
But what should be the vocation, was the inquiry&#xD;
and at this particular moment the chief concern of&#xD;
each.&#xD;
Charles had a strong inclination to enter the&#xD;
Medical Profession, but lest he might decide too&#xD;
hastily, he thought proper to consult an eminent&#xD;
M. D., of, whom he knew much by reputation, and&#xD;
in whose heart and head he had much confidence.&#xD;
He accordingly sat down and wrote as follows:&#xD;
DR. M- D--&#xD;
DEAR SIR:-Being left at an early age to rely upon&#xD;
my own resources for a livelihood, and wishing to select a&#xD;
profession in which I may be able to provide well for&#xD;
myself, and do good to others, I have thought fit to&#xD;
appeal to you. What education I have, has been acquired&#xD;
chiefly by my own unaided endeavors ; though Ihave&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
been for brief periods at different English and Classical&#xD;
schools, and had occasion there to measure intellectual&#xD;
arms with pupils from various parts of the country, and&#xD;
have had no reason to he dissatisfied with the abilities&#xD;
nature has given me. With what knowledge I have of&#xD;
Latin and the Sciences, I think that I could master Medi-&#xD;
cine without any difficulty, and might with that energy&#xD;
and perseverance which I have made it a point to culti-&#xD;
vate, be able to make myself successful and useful. If&#xD;
you will be so kind as to inform me at your earliest con-&#xD;
veiience, what the inducements are to enter upon the&#xD;
study of Medicine, I shall be greatly obliged to you for&#xD;
the favor.&#xD;
&#xD;
Yours truly,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHARLES HOPEWELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
The Doctor, who had long since devoted his life to&#xD;
the service of humanity, and allowed no occasion of&#xD;
doing good to pass unimproved, replied as follows:&#xD;
Mr DEAR CHARLES :-I am very glad to see the interest&#xD;
you take in so necessary a preliminary as that of secur-&#xD;
ing the elements of future independence. This must be&#xD;
done by every young man without fortune, who has the&#xD;
true spirit of manhood within him and wishes to maintain&#xD;
it. I would have you be a true man, and therefore can-&#xD;
not advise you to enter the temple of Esculapius. The&#xD;
god is about to withdraw, and the responses must soon&#xD;
cease, for a better divinity is manifest. Paracelsus and&#xD;
all who follow him cannot save the altar nor prevent the&#xD;
dilapidation of the walls. And when the god is com-&#xD;
manded hence, and the temple has fallen, there will be no&#xD;
more need for priests. I once did the honors of the altar,&#xD;
but have laid aside the robes, and now do homage to none&#xD;
but the everlasting Father and those who are in him.&#xD;
If your only purpose in life was to secure a livelihood&#xD;
you could doubtless 'ucceed, for the worshipers have not&#xD;
given up their idolatry. You might build up a fortune&#xD;
and a name, and the world might call you honorable, but&#xD;
for all this you would hardly be useful. This condition&#xD;
you specify, and I am bound to give it due weight in the&#xD;
consideration of your inquiry.&#xD;
&#xD;
Our world is one of ,progress_ Old-.abuses- must be&#xD;
done away, and the advancing conditions establiied..-&#xD;
This work is for man to do, as the =agent ofocorrecttpinci,&#xD;
pies and superior power.- H  should qualify hitiself for&#xD;
the discharge ,of his duty, -and devote all-his energies d&#xD;
thereto. Usefulness should he the great aim of life, for&#xD;
in making -ourselves useful we seek our own- elevation&#xD;
and promote our own happiness. And whether the. pro.&#xD;
fession-of Medicine is one in-the-regular practice of whiehe-&#xD;
much good.may be done fortour fellow'"man, and a t the&#xD;
same time the best impulses of ou being cultivated and&#xD;
gratified, you will be better -enabled to decides'when I&#xD;
shall  have given an account of my experience.&#xD;
I graduated with honor at oneof the best Ndfieal Odl&#xD;
leges in the.United States, in the spring of 18, ad th0&#xD;
following summer commenced practice inthe city i which&#xD;
I now reside. .The stats were propitious, and: I soon had&#xD;
plenty of- friends. and patients. I was educated in Alfoi&#xD;
pathy according. to the straightest sect, and 1.practiced as&#xD;
conscientiously - and sud essfully as my brethren. - The&#xD;
people amongst who n I labored were as intelligent as any&#xD;
in the city, but with all- their knowledge, and wisdo iymW&#xD;
wealth, and civilization, they -knew little or Idthing6-&#xD;
the laws of health. These were often violated&#xD;
followed, and -here was my harvest, My suee    49&#xD;
pended upon the, misfortunes of others, and this o&#xD;
tion grieved me.  Why should I not   rn    t&#xD;
fellow man, and with him rejoice? -But I could  $i'r&#xD;
ways do so. My nature was hu man, and whenn y hrot=f&#xD;
er suffered I pitied him; but his. loss was mai , an4:i&#xD;
was not blind. I sought for refuge, and arsold mself&#xD;
thus:   The people will get' sick,- =and sinoe thMis&#xD;
inevitable, it is but right that they should have-help eu',&#xD;
as IL consider myself duly qualified- to administer aid, why&#xD;
shedd I reproach myself for-doing so.? -This I knew was'&#xD;
balm to the fraternity, but the vision in my own case .a1  -&#xD;
not so easily healed. Why not ,enlighten&#xD;
thought I, so that the laws4of life may. be obed&#xD;
the greatest 'measure of -health;possiblesee&#xD;
But that wquld rob me oftif e eldyinent I&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS ' IT ~-SHOULD flE.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC7393-00000006"/>&#xD;
the conflict between duty and interest. It was my duty,-&#xD;
as one acquainted with the subject, to teach my -friends-&#xD;
the organic laws, and insist upon, their observance ; but.&#xD;
it was my interest as a member of the profession, to have&#xD;
the people as ignorant as possible of - these laws, since&#xD;
violation on their part brought ease and comfort to me.&#xD;
Let right prevail, thought I, and the conscience be purged.&#xD;
I went to work in a heroic way, gave lectures to the&#xD;
adults, introduced popular Physiology into the' schools,&#xD;
and now that nearly twenty years have elapsed, ham&#xD;
almost wholly out of employment as a-physician. The&#xD;
apothecary- gets no patronage from me, and I have a&#xD;
great consolation in reflecting that I no longer transfer&#xD;
poisonous drugs from his drawers and jars to the stom-"&#xD;
aches of my friends. Rather let the craft of the druggist&#xD;
fail and the sound of the pestle and mortar -be heard no&#xD;
more, than that I should mineralize the habitation of the'&#xD;
soul, and compound disease and suffering for my friends&#xD;
and their offspring.&#xD;
Whilst using drugs in my practice, I. was often pained&#xD;
to witness their ruinous effects upon some of my patients,&#xD;
through the neglect of nurses. The long list of mercurial&#xD;
-diseases startled me. Incurable ulcers, mutilated lips,&#xD;
and toothless mouths were std testimonials to the potency&#xD;
of my remedies-lasting relics, to reproach me with the&#xD;
dire necessities and uncertainties of my art;. but I con-&#xD;
soled myself with the reflection that it was the nursing&#xD;
and not the drugging. We cannot cure without the use&#xD;
of such remedies, and better have trouble of this kind in&#xD;
a few cases than death and horror all around.&#xD;
When I commenced the diffusion of Physiological&#xD;
knowledge, my own prejudices began to loosen and&#xD;
were finally overcome. I could see that health did not&#xD;
depend upon the use of deleterious compounds, but upon&#xD;
the cultivation of the restorative energies of the system,&#xD;
by perfect cleanliness and a judicious attention to diet,&#xD;
exercise, and recreation. I regulated. the habits of my&#xD;
own family by these principles, recommended them -to&#xD;
others, and now there is not a family within the boundary&#xD;
of my former practice but follows my example 'in this&#xD;

Buft with-all our care there is now and then a broken limb,&#xD;

urged more strongly the conditions of usefulness a'nd&#xD;
moral purpose.&#xD;
Ma. Ca&amp;amp;as HoPEWELL :&#xD;
DEAR S&amp;amp;R-Your note of inquiry has been received,&#xD;
and I shall proceed forthwith to reply. If you desire to&#xD;
cultivate the better feelings of humanity and make your",&#xD;
self really useful, you had better let the bar alone. It is&#xD;
a poor place for the cultivation of anything but intellect,.&#xD;
wit, and cunning. Here and there we find an intellectual,&#xD;
and moral prodigy who oversteps his fellows, stands head&#xD;
and shoulders above the filth which covers them, and is&#xD;
a. man in spite of his profession; but it would be utterly&#xD;
impossible for the great herd of legal aspirants to earn&#xD;
even a common reputation and enough to eat, and at the&#xD;
same time elevate and beautify the moral man. Success&#xD;
depends upon the power uncrupulously exercised of mak-&#xD;
ing a strong case out of such material as can be had, so&#xD;
that what is deficient in material must be made up in&#xD;
skilful workmanship. Even when the advocate knows&#xD;
that success in any particular case would be the perver--&#xD;
sion of justice, yet his professional duty as he interprets it,&#xD;
his interest as an advocate, and his pride, all conspire to&#xD;
summon his energies against his conscience as a man.&#xD;
His professional relations are unnatural and vicious, inas-&#xD;
much as their tendency is to tempt him into paths for-&#xD;
bidden by strict integrity. There are few, who have&#xD;
practiced long at the bar, in whom the glory of victory&#xD;
has not more potency than the sense of right. Present&#xD;
such sentiments as these to the bar of any court in your&#xD;
State, and you would be stared into a pump-stock or&#xD;
broadly laughed at. Such moral niceties are not dis-&#xD;
criminated by such as habitually look into the niceties of&#xD;
the law; and herein is to be- found a witness to the moral&#xD;
obtuseness of which I speak.&#xD;
The lawyer lives upon the squabbles of his clients and&#xD;
t le clashing of the basest passions of undeveloped human-&#xD;
it v, and it is consequently his professional interest to&#xD;
foster the worst perversions of our common nature. Just&#xD;
&#xD;
so far as he promotes true education does-he dry up the&#xD;
sources of his vast patronage and its emolnmnets.&#xD;
But more than this, the greater portion ofd this business&#xD;
arias from the. unnatural relations which men sustain&#xD;
toward each, other. If isolated and antagonistic interests&#xD;
did not exist, and the overreaching and animosity which&#xD;
flow from them, gentlemen of the bar would -have but&#xD;
little to do. Hence it is professionally their interest-not&#xD;
only to have 'men continue in ignorance and crime, butt&#xD;
also in unnatural, antagonistic, and consequently vicious&#xD;
relations to ,each other.&#xD;
The lawyer may be a very good man,.but if he is -he&#xD;
will be sure to feel that his profession- is- not a very good&#xD;
one, and if he does not occupy its higher fields of labor,&#xD;
will be altogether likely to abandon it. So, Charles, as&#xD;
you have "thrown physic to the dogs," I would advise&#xD;
you-to do the same with the Law.&#xD;
Yours, &amp;amp;c.;         L. L. D--..&#xD;
Charles was prepared for some of this, but the idea&#xD;
of isolation and antagonism in society, and Nhe, bare&#xD;
presumption that the social relations might be other&#xD;
wise, made altogether quite a puzzle. But'as thbink-&#xD;
ing was a necessity with Charles, 'he determined go&#xD;
profit by everything. he could see and hear., He&#xD;
looked to the Sacred Desk, and saw in the, popular&#xD;
spirit that. there, if anywhere, a man might enter&#xD;
with energy into the discharge of his -professi nal&#xD;
duties, and ennoble himself in the act. But CharIes&#xD;
had learned by experience not to' be too sangiige,&#xD;
and besides, he had a spirit of his own and wheti he&#xD;
relied upon this, he saw by a pretty clear intuition&#xD;
that all is not sacred that wears the romskof holiness&#xD;
before men, and that iiasmuci as the approved faith&#xD;

&#xD;
doing of good.    Charles read 'the answer with&#xD;
some avidity.&#xD;
MY DEAR CHARLES :-By nature, as well as by habit, I&#xD;
feel interested in the future of all young persons, and&#xD;
especially of such as are interested in' their own.&#xD;
I am now engaged in lecturing and wrtiing for the press,&#xD;
and doing good in other of the manifold ways wherein&#xD;
the work of love may be done. I have no fortune, never&#xD;
had the art of acquiring money, get but little now, have&#xD;
to use the greatest economy, and am often compelled to&#xD;
suspend my moral' labors, and resort, for the' means of&#xD;
physical life, to the trade I luckily learned before enter-&#xD;
ing upon the study of Theology. By this means I replen-&#xD;
ish my resources, and, with the aid which friends who&#xD;
love reform are so kind as to furnish me, I have enough&#xD;
to sustain me for awhile in renewed efforts for human&#xD;
good.&#xD;
As you know, I was once' a preacher, and why I am&#xD;
not now you will know best when you have heard&#xD;
my story.&#xD;
Having been duly "called and quallified," as I sup-&#xD;
posed, and thoroughly doctrinated as I knew, into the&#xD;
mysteries and merits of Orthodoxy, I entered upon the&#xD;
ministry. I did as my brethren, who did everything right;&#xD;
and as long as I urged faith rather than works, dOettines&#xD;
rather than practice, I was thought to be an excellent&#xD;
preacher. But this could not last always ; and I saw&#xD;
with pain that my labors were doing no good. Others&#xD;
before me had done as I was doing ; the whole field of&#xD;
doctrinal discussion had been traversed again and again,&#xD;
and even if I did sometimes invest my theme with an&#xD;
attractive freshness, the influence was little more than&#xD;
asthetic, and my people went home as well satisfied with&#xD;
habitual inequity as ever. I became dissatisfied with this&#xD;
dull, profitless, and hopeless routine of church-exercises,&#xD;
and I felt that too much of it was solemn' mockery. I-I&#xD;
wanted to see the fruits of my labors, and to gather in the&#xD;
vintage; but the field 'gave no more evidence of good culb&#xD;
tivation and an abundant harvest, after I had worked for&#xD;
months, than it did when I began.&#xD;
&#xD;
Those who. I served were worldly in every seie of&#xD;
the- -term. There was little or no spirituality  anidagst&#xD;
them, although Christian after the approved fashion of&#xD;
the time and place. It seemed that I was to work out&#xD;
their salvation; for them, while they would..work out the&#xD;
means of present existence for, me and their own way to&#xD;
wealth and honor. This will never 'do, thought I, and&#xD;
the next Sunday I made an assault upon the worship of&#xD;
Mammon, and did not spare the idolaters. There was&#xD;
some squirming, but it was my first attempt in this kind&#xD;
of holy warfare, and as doubtless many hoped it would be&#xD;
the last, they stood it. Oracular criticisms on the bad&#xD;
taste of the sermon, and -shrewd remarks, pointed ud&#xD;
polished for my especial benefit, gave ample satisfaction&#xD;
to those who made them, for any ,enjoyment which- my&#xD;
onset may have been presumed to afford me, and both&#xD;
parties retired from the field; they to-the temple, of their&#xD;
idolatry, and Ito the~companionship of my'ownrrefleetions.&#xD;
A few weeks. after, I .inveighed against the idolatries of&#xD;
Fashion, and showed whither the god was leading his&#xD;
votaries. I touched some tender sensibilities here, and&#xD;
created rather a disagreeable sensation on the wrong side&#xD;
of the house,--wrong so far as my own popularity, place&#xD;
and salary were concerned.&#xD;
I continued kat intervals to expose the abomitiatiops&#xD;
which were practiced in- the Church, in the name of relig-&#xD;
ion, and insisted that the followers of Christ should'exezn-&#xD;
plify his-precepts. I sustained all I said by the hook which&#xD;
they assumed to take as their guide, and tIhoped by such&#xD;
means to revive the energies of living Christianity. But&#xD;
I had mistaken the material with- while ehad to work.&#xD;
My brethren nominally received the Scripttres as their&#xD;
guide and -rule of-faith, and the God of the Bible as their&#xD;
God, but there iwas another divinity, silent and unseen as&#xD;
to the giving forth of his oracles; and-by his standard did&#xD;
they regulate their own 'lives, and measure the doings of&#xD;
others. They' were unwittingly the votaries of the Demon&#xD;
of corrupt society&#xD;
I saw  all this, and deplored. it. I mourned, welt,&#xD;
prayed, and preached with all the zeal- aid-devotionfluoh&#xD;
&#xD;

10               SOCIETY AS IT [S&#xD;
&#xD;
it was natural for me to summon ; but - the harvest was&#xD;
a bhligh,--poisoned by the malignant atmosphere which&#xD;
arose from the.gehenna of social pollution.&#xD;
I studied some of the new sciences which were making&#xD;
just claims upon the candid consideration of an intelligent&#xD;
age, and learned much therefrom. Geology, Phrenology,&#xD;
and Magnetism were particularly fruitful in the elements&#xD;
of useful knowledge, and I was delighted with the addi-&#xD;
tional power which their principles gave me to dispel the&#xD;
obscurities of the Bible. Geology recorded the physical&#xD;
history of. the earth, and I read it with astonislument and&#xD;
gratitude. I could no longer understand Moses as I had&#xD;
done. Phrenology gave me an insight into the characters&#xD;
of others and anunderstanding of my own, for which I&#xD;
thanked the Providence manifest in the genius of Gall.&#xD;
The .philosophy of mpind, and :its multifarious and imponr&#xD;
taut bearigs,. threw a new light upon the whole tenor of&#xD;
the Scripture, and. I used it in the illustration of the same.&#xD;
Magnetism and the wanders of Clairvoyance opened up a&#xD;
system o'ecorrespondencies, and revealed oapascities of the&#xD;
human soul which startled me, but which I had never-&#xD;
theless to admit, and apply to the illustration, of religion&#xD;
an&amp;amp; the futuye of man.&#xD;
I urged, in a private way, upon sormeof my more intelli-&#xD;
gent people,. the study of these- important sciences. I&#xD;
gave a studied and cautious explanation of their character,&#xD;
biut sme of -them refused to have anything to do with&#xD;
such dispating and dangerous.innovations;- These pro-&#xD;
fesesciee, they said, were inconsistent with the. Scrip-&#xD;
tures and consequently false.&#xD;
- A few, however; took hold, and they were truly friends,&#xD;
4o. only of myself,.but of truth and humanity. But -these&#xD;
were comparatively few indeed, and there was a strong&#xD;
tide setting against me, not only in my congregation but&#xD;
amongst -the clergy of my denomination. I was tried,&#xD;
condemned and executed.. This is the, grandest event&#xD;
of ay life. It wholly removed the shackles of bad associa-&#xD;
tion, false doctrine, and blinding prejudices. - It.set me&#xD;
free.. I am vow a disciple of Progress, and my faith and&#xD;
region are themselves progressive. I can see as clearly&#xD;
&#xD;
as I see the harmony of, truth, that the #A trineaof the&#xD;
plenary ispiration. of the Scriptures is- nof *rue  :e a&#xD;
delusion- of ignorance and superstition., I can see -that&#xD;
society is vicious/ in the very uatu're of its eonstitution.&#xD;
Individual is at war with individual; the many are set&#xD;
against,.one, and -one against the many ;. and kall this&#xD;
is a necessity of the relations which man sustains to man.&#xD;
It can do but little good to preach tovthe individual while&#xD;

unfolding truth, and those trfo enter its precincts are&#xD;
pledged alike to its- virtues 4nd its vices. My counsel is,&#xD;
be free, and then there is no one to molest nor make afraid&#xD;
in all God's holy mountain. The error may be avoided&#xD;
and the truth thought,- spoken, lived. The true man&#xD;
rises above the ignorance and emptiness of groveling&#xD;
humanity, and his sphere is "full of the knowledge of the&#xD;
Lord as the waters cover the sea."&#xD;
It is the professional interest of the clergy to cultivate&#xD;
ignorance and superstition. It may be the interest of one&#xD;
sect in its relations to another to promote education with-&#xD;
in its pale; but it must be adapted to the peculiar appetite&#xD;
of the sect. The knowledge communicated must be in&#xD;
harmony with its dogmas, or it is anathematized. Seclulax&#xD;
education is denounced by some branches of the Church,&#xD;
and with the best of reasons, judging from the stand-point&#xD;
of clerical interest. Germany, and portions of the United&#xD;
States, are referred to -as evidence of the irreligious ten-&#xD;
dencv of education separated from ecclesiastical direction.&#xD;
And all church-organizations would oppose such educa-&#xD;
tion were it not that, since knowledge is power, it gives&#xD;
them  present importance with reference to rival sects.&#xD;
But they would oppose it, nevertheless, were it not that&#xD;
their insight of principles and perceptions of the future are&#xD;
too vague and shadowy to enable them to realize that&#xD;
true education is pregnant with destruction to them as&#xD;
well as to Romansm.&#xD;
When the people shall have become thoroughly edu-&#xD;
cated, the authority of the Church and the power of-the&#xD;
clergy are at an end forever. This being the case, it- is&#xD;
the interest of the emissaries of the Church to foster a&#xD;
certain kind of ignorance for the superstition which accom-&#xD;
panies it; and this can only be done while they have un-&#xD;
disciplined minds to work with. The mind that is truly&#xD;
educated thinks for itself upon religious as well as other&#xD;
subjects, speaks freely what it thinks, and acts as boldly.&#xD;
It is to bring about this condition of humanity that all the&#xD;
free should labor; but the clergy as a body war against it.&#xD;
They raise the unreasoning cry of "scepticism" and "infi-&#xD;
delity," and seek to promote a discipline of mind-the reverse&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS fl SHOULD JP .&#xD;
of tree education. They teach themsubmission of- reason&#xD;
to faith, whereasit is the true- object of education to de-&#xD;
velop the reasoning faculties in harmony with MThe- whod&#xD;
mental and spiritual being, to disenthrall them from the&#xD;
tyranny of passion, prejudice and blind faith, that 'they&#xD;
may be strong and free to act correctly and efficient-ly&#xD;
upon all subjects, whether of art, science, philosophy or&#xD;
religion.&#xD;
A friend of mine, better situated than mnysg"lf, began&#xD;
about the same time - the work of- reform.amongst the&#xD;
members of his -,charge, and was, far more successful.&#xD;
Thiswas'a rural district, away from the'bustlin and noisy&#xD;
haunts of avarice and-fashion, and the:people freer frofnL&#xD;
prejudice, and more deliberately thoughtful.  - -&#xD;
My friend managed to-enlist the favor of the orein,&#xD;
telligent, and had set the preponderating weight of-mind&#xD;
and influence to moving, before the ever-watchful 4ragon&#xD;
of conservatism could -rally his votaries. Swayed by the&#xD;
magnetism'of the more active and energetic, the entire&#xD;
congregation, with only here -'and there an exception,&#xD;
drifted along with -the current, became interested ein the&#xD;
freshness and beauty which surrounded them, and now&#xD;
rejoice in liberty as it is in the gospel of folding truth.&#xD;
They do their own religious thinking and acting, and&#xD;
there is perfect tolerance. - Having rid themselves of&#xD;
prejudice, they are brethren in the search of truth, add&#xD;
they assist each-other. -. They are willing teachers and&#xD;
ready learners, and see almost eye to eye. Their-religion&#xD;
does not consist in-cold forms andsenselessand soulless&#xD;

Charles was a little startled at the novelty and the&#xD;
audacity of this letter, and fairly concluded that there&#xD;
were more things in heaven and earth than were&#xD;
dreamed of in his philosophy. He wanted to know&#xD;
more of these things. He did not know why a man&#xD;
might not live a life true to his being, in society 'as&#xD;
it is. He called to mind some sedate and pious peo-&#xD;
pie who' he thought could not exemplify the christian&#xD;

Rev. J. B. W---:&#xD;
DEA FRIEND :-I have read your letter with-much&#xD;
interest.and profit. - It opened up-to me new connections&#xD;
of thought; but there are some things which I cannot com-&#xD;
prehend. I have been led to think :it is possible for&#xD;
those who will it, to do. what is right upon all occasions&#xD;
abd under all circumstances, and that it is rather desirable&#xD;
than otherwise that the conditions should be unfavorable,&#xD;
inasmuch as the moral courage and energy called into&#xD;
action is a good moral discipline and strengthening to the&#xD;
virtues, in addition to the mere act -of doing right consid-&#xD;
ered apart from the circumstances under which it is done.&#xD;
If such be the true doctrine, it would seem to be advisable&#xD;
t. seek no better condition of society than weynow have,&#xD;
as under unfavorable conditions a higher moral discipline&#xD;
would be obtained. But even if it were'better to change&#xD;
the order of society, I should not know how it could be&#xD;
done. -'In short, I don't see how men's interests are to be&#xD;
harmonized, even if' we had omnipotent power over hu.&#xD;
man relations: Be.so kind as to answer.&#xD;
Yours truly,   . CHARLEs HOPEWELL.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mv Dzn CHAREES-AS towhetherh mali nu be'tiful&#xD;
a Christian under existing circumstances, I answer, t'hat&#xD;
if possible at all, it is only with the greatest dificulty'&#xD;
Isolation 'without antagonism is unfavorable to =hristian&#xD;
development; for in whatever position of life they individ-&#xD;
ual i placed, he ;has to bear, the burden of -distraetiig'&#xD;
cares upon his own individual account; and there 'are few&#xD;
indeed who have not- their - strong besetting sins, and&#xD;
hardly one in all this earth but suffers, a degrading infu,&#xD;
ence from labors, cares, or vexations which appeai'to' the&#xD;
animal man-against the moral energy es of the .soul.: Een&#xD;
those who surfeit in luxury and rust in idlenessare'tora-&#xD;
mented with ennui for want of attractive employment and&#xD;
meet companionship.&#xD;
But when to isolation is added the antagonism-which&#xD;
is felt in almost= every department of our social structure,&#xD;
the case',is still worse. Whatever -their professions men&#xD;
can no -longer be brethren. This I 'will illustratesby an&#xD;
example.r&#xD;
Our Postmaster is an exemplary ,Christian, qutite intel-&#xD;
lectual, writes for 'the press, and keeps books' for. sales&#xD;
I was in but a few days since, and. there was &amp;amp; preacher,&#xD;
as I took hinj to be, trying to make a purchase of Clarks&#xD;
Commentaries. They could not agree on-the price, anid&#xD;
there was quite an effort- at cheapening ,on the onle hand,;&#xD;
but avery calm and determined resistance onthe other.&#xD;
For 'the' moment I was -.amused- at ,the dhafferingnd&#xD;
giggling between them, but. upon -reflection I felt "tha I&#xD;
should be sad rather than merry.&#xD;
There was-some craft in the management of the busi4&#xD;
ness, but every word was expressed with a great deal oft&#xD;
kindness., As Igathered it, the books had been ebndition.&#xD;
ally ordered,'but the purchaser seemed to apprehntahat&#xD;
his brother was intent on rather :too large'a profit; whbFe&#xD;
the latter endeavored to create theimpression that the&#xD;
set was cheap at ten dollars. Having exbti'tvsted his in-&#xD;
direct skill; the' buyer asked, at length,, "What do 'they.&#xD;
stand you ?"'That was a poser,; and his brother ptouk&#xD;
not hear ; but'the questions was repe atedandhe dswelrei4&#xD;

a " fair question," but he did not know why he might-not&#xD;
violate the etiquette of trade in dealing with a worthy&#xD;
and confiding. brother; bu.t the other did know.&#xD;
Having finished reading my letter, I now left. how-&#xD;
leng-Bonaparte and Wellington continued the encounter,&#xD;
I cannot pretend to say. The books, I presume, were not&#xD;
sold, as  have seen them there since.&#xD;
. These two men, the one as seller and the other as&#xD;
buyer, stood in antagonistic relations to each other, and&#xD;
though Christianity required them to be brothers, civiliza-&#xD;
tion forbid it. I do not envy the man his intellectual-&#xD;
penetration and moral sensibility, who can see and feel no&#xD;
wrong in such social relations, yet it is-to be feared that-&#xD;
these two professing Christians were-hardly- conscious- of&#xD;
the unnatural and unbrotherly conflict in which they&#xD;
here met.   The one suspected the other of asking too.&#xD;
much for the books, or in other words of being a little too&#xD;
much devoted to the greed of the world, while his broth-&#xD;
er doubtless blamed him for his "sustained- effort" at&#xD;
cheapening, and, the unmannerly means he used to ac-&#xD;
complish his purpose. Further, in all probability, they&#xD;
did- not reflect.. :But, whether conscious or not of their&#xD;
unfraternal relations to each other, they suffered, never-&#xD;
theless, the evil influence- of the unchristian conflict. In&#xD;
this ungallant encounter they were not one as Christ and&#xD;
the-Father, and judge you, therefore, whether, the chil-&#xD;
dren of God. " By their fruits shall ye know them."&#xD;
' This kind of antagonism prevails in all that relates to&#xD;
buying sad selling. The farmer is perhaps freer from this&#xD;
baneful influence than any of his brethren ; but theyn he&#xD;
must sell and buy, and consequently breathe the infectious&#xD;
atmosphere of commerce.-&#xD;
The mechanic feels the wrongs of society more painfully.&#xD;

In contracting for a job it is his interest to getas  ieh-&#xD;
and his employer's to pay as little, as -possible.  re&#xD;
antagonism. It is the interest of the-former to-spend.as&#xD;
little labor as will suffice to get the job off his hands and&#xD;
save his credit as a workman, while it is the interest of the&#xD;
latter to get as much labor and the job as well executedas&#xD;
possible.' There again isantagonism. Ofseveral mechan&#xD;
ics it in the interest of each to get the -same job, a&amp;amp; as&#xD;
but one can do so, in the-strife they are euen iis. They&#xD;
may have been brethren to all appearance on Sunday, and&#xD;
received together the sacrament of the -Lords-upper yet&#xD;
on Monday they are striving for self and trying to over-&#xD;
reach :one another. With some this may be merely a&#xD;
temptation, but with others it is a dread necessity owing&#xD;
to the want of meais- to keepsoul and body together.&#xD;
Some may be so circumstanced as-to worldly gopds, and&#xD;
so constituted morally that they can resist, to-a great ex&#xD;
tent, these evil influences, -Others may be :so circum-&#xD;
stanced that the temptation becomes atnecessityand they&#xD;
must violate the highest attributes of theirnature. Other.&#xD;
still may be- so constituted spiritually that theatenptations&#xD;
to wrong are omnipotent over them.   ut the strongest,&#xD;
both as to circumstances and mental constitution, live in&#xD;
the midst of contagion, breathe the miasmatic atmosphere,&#xD;
and must suffer the moral .paralysis to a greateror'less&#xD;
extent. "Evil communication corrupts goo&amp;amp; ni rer '-=&#xD;

24    SOCIETY AS IT is&#xD;
&#xD;
suppose, what a man wills he may do,-unless prevented by&#xD;
necessities not to be found in his own mind; but the&#xD;
difficulty is in the willing. It is for this reason that man's&#xD;
redemption will not be effected by operating solely upon&#xD;
the individual.  It is true that the 'mass must be&#xD;
operated on through the individual, but until the form of&#xD;
society is changed so that the inducements to action are&#xD;
on - the side of virtue, the 'individual -must continue to&#xD;
yield to the wiles of the tempter, for the tempter will'&#xD;
still live.&#xD;
If it were good for man that he be tempted, so that by&#xD;
overcoming evil he might make virtue strong, it would&#xD;
be well to make the conditions of society as bad as possi-&#xD;
ble. But this course is condemned by the labors of all&#xD;
good men. And if in a few things it is better to remove&#xD;
temptation and present incitement to good, it is better'&#xD;
that the same should be done in all things.&#xD;
As to the manner of changing the conditions of society,-&#xD;
it would make this letter too long to present the merest&#xD;
sketch of any scheme likely to produce such a result.&#xD;
You will excuse me for the present, and believe me&#xD;

and I reply with pleasure. If you value your spiritual&#xD;
interest you will not think of becoming a clerk. There&#xD;
is no business within the whole range of human vocation&#xD;
which presents so much- temptation to wrong. Clerks&#xD;
must learn to lie indirectly, and, if pressed too hard, direct-&#xD;
ly--there is no alternative. When formerly engaged in&#xD;
merchandising according to the approved fashion, consid-&#xD;
erations of success made it absolutely necessary to shift&#xD;
off all such clerks as had too much simplicity of character&#xD;
and moral integrity to be broken into the regular dis-.&#xD;

Commerce is a game of chance, and some who play at&#xD;
it become as unprincipled as professional gamblers.- In&#xD;
this as in other games, there are losers, as we have seen,&#xD;

It gives me pain to contemplate the golden years I-&#xD;
have lost, and worse than lost, under the damning influ-&#xD;
ences of this profession. I did nothing but what was&#xD;
deemed strictly honorable, as reckoned by the standard-&#xD;

- It was, my interest to cultivate the friendship of my&#xD;
customers, but I could not help but feel that every one&#xD;
who entered for the purpose of buying, was in some sense&#xD;
my enemy. It was my interest to get as much, and his to&#xD;
pay as little, as possible. Chaffering and craft on his&#xD;
part had to be met on mine,.and thus I came into disagree-&#xD;
able contact with almost every customer I had. Our&#xD;
relations to each other were to all appearances friendly&#xD;
and kind enough, but I felt' with poignance the=discord of-&#xD;

and that htnnanity had -reason to rejoice in the&#xD;
desecration. What a union store was, he-could not&#xD;
fully decipher. - He had seen the name in the public&#xD;
news, and felt some curiosity at the time, but now&#xD;
he determined to watch more closely, and perhaps&#xD;
he' would soon find a complete solution of the&#xD;
mystery.&#xD;
From the clergyman's second letter, Charles, had&#xD;
got a pretty good idea of the evils of antagonism to&#xD;
which some of the mechanical employments are sub-&#xD;
ject. But , he thought that all .could not -be thus&#xD;
exposed, and so he visited an intelligent shoemaker&#xD;
He supposed that a skilful workman in this business&#xD;
would not feel such strife with his brothers of the&#xD;
same occupation, as obtains amongst carpenters,&#xD;
wagonmakers, bricklayers, &amp;amp;c., with whom a single&#xD;
job is a matter of so much more importance. He&#xD;
shaped his statement accordingly, and having made&#xD;
known his wants and wishes, was thus responded to:.&#xD;
"Friend Charles-So far as shoemaking is con-&#xD;
cerned, a good workman can make a living for a&#xD;
large family, if he sticks to his business and attends&#xD;
to nothing else. But as you seem to value the higher&#xD;
ends of our being, I should not recommend it. It&#xD;
will not do if one does think-independently, to speak&#xD;
and act too boldly. The people will not-allow their&#xD;
prejudices and antipathies to be crowded too closely;&#xD;
- for 'they are as careful about good believing in their&#xD;
cobbler as about good pegging and stitching, and&#xD;
would rather be pinched with an ilifitting shoe, than&#xD;
with the reflection of having patronized an ungodly&#xD;
shoemaker. There are enough to cringe. to these&#xD;
unrighteous exactions. They are in the Church and&#xD;
out of the Church, rich and poor, old and. young.&#xD;
Popular opinion is their conscience, and. I have seen&#xD;
them choose their words, square their conduct, and&#xD;
sacrifice their manhood, all for the good opinion of&#xD;
&#xD;
others; and theydidenet seem sensible of theirdega.&#xD;
daltion. Some. persons -are nothig to .temselires;&#xD;

If they see an-.ugly image, they are frightenediand&#xD;
have not: philosophy enough; to attribute itto the&#xD;
reflecting surface, but go to zvwork distorting them&#xD;
selves to get the picture endurable.' Such i. tte&#xD;

may you become strong to - crush down oppression&#xD;

Chatles heard-.a tear started to his eye, and that&#xD;
moment he consecrated himself to -the service of&#xD;
humanity. Ministering spirits were present; ;they&#xD;
infused into his soul the divine energies of their own&#xD;
fine sphere, and he felt their inspiring presence.&#xD;
Charles resolved to be independent at all events.&#xD;
He had been- considerably amongst the farmers, and&#xD;
thought that- they, if any in civilization, might-be&#xD;
noblemen. They could produce their own bread;&#xD;
and with their surplus produce procure groceries,&#xD;
clothing, books, newspapers, periodicals--in -short,&#xD;
all the necessaries, conveniences, comforts, and - ap-&#xD;
purtenances of a life such as a man of true aspiration&#xD;
might desire.&#xD;
Charles demanded the scanty patrimony which had&#xD;
been left him, and with this and his sister's, he pur-&#xD;
chased a small farm. He had some knowledge of&#xD;
farming, got a work or two on the" art, subscribed&#xD;
for an agricultural paper, purchased a team, with&#xD;
the requisite implements,,and went to plowing.&#xD;
Without doubt Charles made a wise choice, but&#xD;
he did not realize all he anticipated. He could feel&#xD;
that he was independent in some respects, but in&#xD;
others the veriest slave. He' could -speak and at&#xD;
&#xD;

times were born of raining weather, whe i electrical&#xD;
disturbance renders the mind lethargic and altogether&#xD;
unfit for vigorous and sustained effort. -  - -&#xD;
And then during harvest,plantings ieding, and n&#xD;
some other occasions, -there-was a rush of work&#xD;
which drew too largely upon Charlest physical eners&#xD;
gies, and did him harm.  -ite was altogether out of&#xD;
the range of his attractions. on such cca ions;his&#xD;
nature was outraged, and at times he felt despondent.&#xD;
The mind could niot work undersucWkdudgery, the&#xD;
spiritual nature seemed blnted, and Charles felt that&#xD;
at these timesdie Was really imbruiting himself.---But&#xD;
he saw: no bettei- situation in life  none so good in&#xD;

The retired nature of his ocepation, together with&#xD;

I have said, was -a thinker. Hekcould see :larly&#xD;
enough that the unfavorable conditions -which 1h&#xD;

AND AS IT SHOULD BE.           33&#xD;
&#xD;
bargain in the selling. In buying, he ascertained that&#xD;
the larger the purchase the lower the rates at which&#xD;
it was to be had. He observed that his farm re.&#xD;
quired much more fencing in proportion to its size&#xD;
than larger ones, and that with his one plow and&#xD;
team he could cultivate much more ground than he&#xD;
had. Why not associate, thought Charles, and be&#xD;
brothers?  A large barn is far less expense in pro-&#xD;
portion to the room it contains, than the small one&#xD;
I have. A spacious house which would accomodate&#xD;
several families would afford the same economies&#xD;
over the little one I live in. I must have one&#xD;
kitchen for myself and sister; a dozen families must&#xD;
each have the same;-let us unite, and one kitchen&#xD;
well furnished will do us all. Here I must spend&#xD;
several hours per week doing errands at the nearest&#xD;
town-five miles off. Articles must be had. out of&#xD;
the store or grocery, the plowshare must be sharp-&#xD;
ened, a ring mended, or the horses shod. And&#xD;
there's the mail-it must be had at least once a week,&#xD;
or the news gets old, accumulates, and is a heavy&#xD;
job to get through with. All these errands I must&#xD;
do for one household, one farm; and each of my&#xD;
twelve neighbors must do the same. How selfish&#xD;
and stupid ! One could do all this business as well&#xD;
and nearly as quickly as the whole thirteen. Stars&#xD;
of my country I am 1 crazy, or what'is the matter?&#xD;
Charles was not so crazy that he could not cipher.&#xD;
He reckoned the economies which ,would thus be&#xD;
secured by association, and ascertained that for eight&#xD;
or ten families, they would be more than one.half.&#xD;
But this would not be all tle.gain. There would be&#xD;
many, with the same interest, and always at each oth-&#xD;
ers' elbows, to assist in case of a throng. When the&#xD;
demand for labor in a. certain direction should be&#xD;
very urgent,-it could be withdrawn from other sour-&#xD;
ces, and the corn planted, harvest cut and secured,&#xD;
&#xD;
the grain sowed, or corn gathered without overwork-&#xD;
ing any. So far from being seasons of dread and&#xD;
drudgery, Charles thought they might be seasons of&#xD;
mere sport. The whole business, moreover, could&#xD;
be .assisted with machinery, so well adapted to&#xD;
the larger operations of anassociation, and this can&#xD;
only be realized in isolation with difficulty and&#xD;
trouble.&#xD;
But this was not all. The economies of even a&#xD;
small association,; amounting to more than fifty per&#xD;
cent., would enable all the members of .uch a ctno-&#xD;
munity, to do as well on five hours labor per, day as&#xD;
they had done on ten in isolation. Charles thought&#xD;
this a glorious feature, the essence in fact ., of the&#xD;
whole matter, and was so enraptured with the idea,&#xD;
that he fancied all he had to do was to tell his story&#xD;

of association over isolation. He did so, and his&#xD;
neighbors laughed at him. They had always been&#xD;
used to the good old way, and that way was the best,&#xD;
The glory'of truth as he felt it in.his own nature and&#xD;
aspirations, was counterbalanced by the, shock of a&#xD;
repulse so rude, and he deplored the selfishness, preju-&#xD;
dice, and ignorance which darkened the intellects and&#xD;
blunted.the- moral sensibilities of those around him.&#xD;
But Charles stuck .to. his farm, as I said, isolation and&#xD;
all;-he could do no better.&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
CHARLES AND POLITICS.&#xD;
CHARLES had a generous ambition and an active&#xD;
mind, as I have said, and these gave him a desire to&#xD;
be of use in his" day and. generation."  He must act&#xD;
-it was a necessity of his nature-and, as with all&#xD;
persons, circumstances had much to do in giving&#xD;
direction to his energies.-&#xD;
He heard much theological discussion, thought for&#xD;
himself, and discussed the topics of the pulpit with his&#xD;
young friends; but further he could not well go. He&#xD;
did not see that there was any useful outlet to his en-&#xD;
ergies in this direction. He could not realize the re-&#xD;
generation of which others spoke, and so did not feel&#xD;
that it would become him to teach in matters of&#xD;
religion.&#xD;
Some two or three of his young acquaintances,&#xD;
much more ignorant than himself, were "born again,&#xD;
called and qualified," and in a very short time entered&#xD;
upon the ministry. Charles had-no-great confidence&#xD;
in such " experience."  He preferred better fruit as&#xD;
the warrant of change in the character of the tree.&#xD;
If, as in olden times, with the new spirit alledged to&#xD;
have been received, commensurate wisdom and pow-&#xD;
er from on high had been manifested, he-would have&#xD;
believed; but the new-born teachers seemed as stu-&#xD;
pid as before, and had no wish to rise above the dead&#xD;
level of know-little-or-nothing; and Charles did not&#xD;
like so much assumption in connection with so much&#xD;
ignorance. He was conscious of the abundance of&#xD;
&#xD;
his own ignirigt and so did not set himself up as&#xD;
one of the chosen, and as.a teacher in Israel. Never-&#xD;
theless he loved theology well,-had a natural taste for&#xD;
the higher range of its studies, and revelled there as&#xD;
an - amateur.&#xD;
Meantime,.there must be a practical outlet, if possi-&#xD;
ble, for Charles' superabundant energies; and the&#xD;
political field was open for adventurers. He had no&#xD;
mental attraction for this department of human en-&#xD;
deavor, but still he did not know why a man of ca-&#xD;
pacity might not, with good motives, do good in the&#xD;
way of politics.&#xD;
Charles had been trained up to regular democracy,&#xD;
lived in a democratic neighborhood, read democratic&#xD;
journals, and so, it may be presumed, was a pretty&#xD;
strong democrat, with no high opinion of whiggery.&#xD;
At the time of which I speak, Charles had not got&#xD;
far into his "teens."  Whatever might be his voca-&#xD;
tion hereafter, he thought that there was a chance&#xD;
for usefulness in this direction ; or rather, felt and&#xD;
knew that there was an outlet for present mental en-&#xD;
ergy, and accordingly he met with the democrats at&#xD;
their caucuses and public gatherings, and was often&#xD;
called on for a speech, young as -he was. He was&#xD;
prepared for these occasions, and, having a full charge&#xD;
of magnetism,, though not altogether of the popular&#xD;
kind, yet he generally managed to make considerable&#xD;
of an impression. His nature was genial, and his&#xD;
manners altogether unassuming, so: that he made&#xD;
warm friends, and long before he was old enough&#xD;
they wanted to put him on the track for office. But&#xD;
finding that he was too young, one of the good old&#xD;
regulars, and a " simon pure," whom they all famil-&#xD;
iaily called Bob Davyson, told him in rather a confi-&#xD;
dential way, for solace, perhaps, that should he be&#xD;
true to his party and labor well, he would never have&#xD;
occasion to exclaim, "God save me from my friends,"&#xD;
&#xD;

"O CI TyAS IT I%&#xD;
&#xD;
38             AND AS IT SHOULD BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
Charles was still in his teens when he began to see&#xD;
a little into the nature of party. The low abuse, vi-&#xD;
tuperation, hate and slang of professed political pa-&#xD;
pers and orators were offensive to him; but he bore&#xD;
with these things as the weakness of others, rather&#xD;
than as a necessity of partyism. Once Charles'&#xD;
mind got a start in the right direction, he was not&#xD;
long in tracing the whole drift of party manceuvering.&#xD;
The machinery was worked behind the scenes, and&#xD;
the great mass of the people knew little or nothing of&#xD;
it. There was a great profession of love for the dear&#xD;
people, and they were generally silly enough to be-&#xD;
lieve it. The rank and file of each party supposed&#xD;
their own leaders very paragons of patriotism and&#xD;
disinterestedness; but Charles could probe deep&#xD;
enough into human motives to understand very well&#xD;
that the initiated only laughed at the people for a set&#xD;
of fools. The office seeking dynasty were making&#xD;
use of the people for their own aggrandizement, as&#xD;
kings and tyrants do in other countries for their own&#xD;
glory-with this difference, that there they are driv-&#xD;
en by the force of brute energy ; but here, drawn by&#xD;
the,wiles of stratagem. There the will originates&#xD;
with the few, and is made to act directly upon the&#xD;
people; here the will originates with the few, and&#xD;
the people are skilfully made the tools to act upon&#xD;
themselves.&#xD;
Charles' attention was first drawn to the corrup-&#xD;
tion of parties, by their strategy in the distributing of&#xD;
States. The strongest party would do up the dis,&#xD;
tributing in its own way, aiming to get two to one&#xD;
*     in the next delegation to Congress, or the next Legis-&#xD;
lature, as the case might be. It would happen, too,&#xD;
that when one party could not get the distributing&#xD;
done according to its own geometry, its patriotic&#xD;
members would resign and go home. They did not&#xD;
hesitate to sacrifice the Legislature of their State to&#xD;
party.fidelity,-such de,voted and devotional patriots&#xD;
&#xD;
were they I But, when one party would succeed it&#xD;
its designs, the other would declare. the appointment&#xD;
law unconstitutional; and then came the contest for&#xD;
seats, waged with all the bitterness of personal con-&#xD;
tention.- And again, with one party successful, the&#xD;
other would meet in solemn conclave, and its self-&#xD;
sacrificing champions pledge their sacred-honor, not&#xD;
to take their seats if elected, and thus resolve the State&#xD;
into anarchy, or, as they said, resolve the -govern-&#xD;
ment into its original elements, and deliver it into the&#xD;
hands of the people;-they. loved the people so, and&#xD;
had such confidence in them; but as the event showed,&#xD;
they loved office, too, for they did take their seats,&#xD;
and put their trust in them., At least they took them&#xD;
on the first day at an earlier hour than usual, made&#xD;
sure of their speaker, and lest the other party should&#xD;
have a chance to elect another, they stuck to them&#xD;
all night. Valiant men carried pistols and talked of&#xD;
shooting one another. Week after week was wasted,&#xD;
the people's money squandered, and nothing done&#xD;
but quarreling; all for the good of the country.A&#xD;
All this was deeply insulting to the people, butthey&#xD;
did not seem to know it. All they could see, as a&#xD;
general thing, was that one party was right, and the&#xD;
other was wrong. But Charles, as I have said, was&#xD;
getting his eyes open.&#xD;
The whig party passed a very good tax law; it had&#xD;
weak-points,it is, true, but its general feature.,and the&#xD;
fundamental principles pon which it was hased, were&#xD;
unexceptionable,.  Charles saw this,- but =his party&#xD;
could see nothing that .was good. The, thing was&#xD;
novel, it interfered with people's property-a sensi-&#xD;
tive point, and the democratic journals. were glad of&#xD;
it. They waged relentless war,.misrepresented the&#xD;
law, distorted the good and exaggerated the bad.&#xD;

SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
38            AND AS IT SHOULD BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
It was just so on all hands. One party would&#xD;
" come down" upon the other, "all fours,"--for it is&#xD;
a beast-and that, too, for what itself would do, and&#xD;
perhaps had done, under similar circumstances. In&#xD;
nominating a candidate for office, no principles would&#xD;
be declared, and sometimes the candidate himself&#xD;
would not venture to open his lips, lest some offen-&#xD;
sive word should escape and damage his prospects.&#xD;
And then if the aspirant should make a declaration,&#xD;
it must be clothed in such ambiguous language that&#xD;
men of his party, antipodes in sentiment, could adapt&#xD;
it to their predilections and vote for him with a clear&#xD;
conscience. This was especially true of candidates&#xD;
for the Presidency. Availability was the grand con-&#xD;
sideration in convention ; success the grand consid-&#xD;
eration afterwards, and the means were adapted to&#xD;
the end.&#xD;
Charles had observed this, and began to reason&#xD;
coolly as to what course he should adopt for himself.&#xD;
What was good in the opposite party he could ac-&#xD;
knowledge, and what was ;vrong in his own he could&#xD;
condemn. He tried to reason with some of his friends&#xD;
of both parties, but they were as "firm as a rock,"&#xD;
as one of them said. A few could see into the leger-&#xD;
demain of party, but when it came to voting, they&#xD;
fell into the ranks for fear "the other party would&#xD;
beat." Love of opposition and the narrowest preju.&#xD;
dices ruled them. Charles became disgusted, and his&#xD;
partyism cooled off greatly. He spoke his mind free-&#xD;
ly, and his old friends who seemed the most forward&#xD;
to promote him for the services rendered to the good&#xD;
cause of democracy, were now the first to desert him.&#xD;
With these people there was no greater virtue than&#xD;
devotion to party. With them, in their honest sim-&#xD;
plicity, partizan fidelity was the culmination of patri-&#xD;
otism, and they demanded it with scrupulous ex-&#xD;
actitude.&#xD;
&#xD;
Charles had become a suspicious: character. He&#xD;
could not see everything right his party did; and this&#xD;
was enough to place him under the ban of all who&#xD;
stood ".straight up and down" in the ranks of party,&#xD;
and might be called regulars. They thought him a&#xD;
tory, federalist, whig, abolitionist, or something equal-&#xD;
ly as bad. At least they said he' was a traitor to his&#xD;
party;--they cashiered him, and he was glad.of it. It&#xD;
set him free; and as he now realized how much bet-&#xD;
ter it was to be a freeman than a slave to party, his&#xD;
mind was made up as to his future course When&#xD;
Cass went over to slavery and .denied the. right of&#xD;
Congress to legislate for the territories-a right&#xD;
which Congress had frequently exercised, and several&#xD;
Presidents sanctioned-he deserted him, and .though&#xD;
he was not old enough to vote, yet, so far as he was&#xD;
able, he gave his support to Van Buren and Adams.&#xD;
He labored with all the zeal and energy for which&#xD;
he was distinguished, when fairly enlisted in what he&#xD;
deemed a good cause. He was instrumental in giv-&#xD;
ing a few votes to liberty, and he felt that he was&#xD;
well rewarded for his pains; but some of his friends&#xD;
told him that he was ruining his reputation and mak-&#xD;
ing wreck of his influence. They argued that as&#xD;
there could be no hope of electing the man of his&#xD;
choice, he had better labor where there was more&#xD;
prospect of a successful issue. But Charles could not&#xD;
appreciate their logic and did not like-to favor iniqui-&#xD;
ty in any shape, even if by his own-efforts he could&#xD;
add to the chances of the less iniquity over the great-&#xD;
er; and so he chose to make his voice heard directly&#xD;
in behalf of truth and liberty.&#xD;
'Facts afterwards confirmed the wisdom of Charles'&#xD;
course,-wisdom in the practical sense, for, though&#xD;
there were but thirty-five thousand votes polled in his&#xD;
own State for freedom, yet, even with this compar-&#xD;
atively small number, much was done; The vety&#xD;

&#xD;
AND AS IT SHOULD BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
next winter the "Black Laws" were repealed, and a&#xD;
true man elected to the United States Senate. This&#xD;
little band of independents, though embracing only&#xD;
about one seventh of the voters in the State, accom-&#xD;
plished more for its measures than either of the other&#xD;
parties did for theirs. It is not always numbers that&#xD;
prevail, nor the semblance of power, and even ty-&#xD;
rants and demagogues tremble in the presence of&#xD;
truth and determination. But whether immediately&#xD;
successful or not, Charles had a supreme confidence&#xD;
in the power of right, and held it his duty to stand&#xD;
up for it under all circumstances. He had but little&#xD;
taste for policy and legerdemain, even with the right&#xD;
in view, but chose rather to be direct, and trust to&#xD;
progress and the future. He never chose- between&#xD;
evils except in cases of absolute necessity, and these&#xD;
were few indeed. When two evils presented them-&#xD;
selves he took neither. He stood aloof, or else ar-&#xD;
rayed himself against both, hoping in this way to ob-&#xD;
viate the necessity and even the occasions of having&#xD;
to decide between evil, sand taking a demon into one's&#xD;
embrace merely because it is the less of two. And&#xD;
Charles thought, furthermore, that if..the greater&#xD;
wrong should prevail in consequence of the with-&#xD;
drawal of support from the less, the mischief would&#xD;
be only a present one, and the reaction for good far&#xD;
greater. To temper wrong and oppression so that&#xD;
it can be just barely endured, only serves to prolong&#xD;
the evils; while if they come too heavy for endurance,&#xD;
the yoke is thrown off and ,humanity set free. It is&#xD;
thus that the greater evil may be eventually the less&#xD;
of the two. Charles was a true man even in his&#xD;
boyhood.&#xD;
Four years afterwards he had occasion again to&#xD;
put his principles into practice. He saw clearly&#xD;
enough that the two old parties were standing on&#xD;
the same platform; contending merely for the spoils,&#xD;
&#xD;
SOCr1rT AS IT I8'&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
and duping the people into party conflict by The tal-&#xD;
isman of old names, which they had seen on their&#xD;
banners and rallied round in days of yore. Charles&#xD;
was sad to see the way the world was going, and&#xD;
could hardly restrain himself from entering into the&#xD;
contest. But he held it to be the duty of every man&#xD;
to consider well his own tastes and capacities, arid&#xD;
not only so, but the circumstances in which he is&#xD;
placed, and so act as to accomplish the most good for&#xD;
himself and others. But Charles had no great liking&#xD;
for politics, as I have said, and besides, he livedaamong&#xD;
an ignorant. and' superstitious people, with whom,&#xD;
political, religious, and social heretic as he'was known&#xD;
to be, he would not be likely to effect much; 'and so&#xD;
he determined to desist and apply his labors in a way&#xD;
more congenial to his attractions and more encour-&#xD;
aging with the prospect of a future harvest of human&#xD;
good. But when it came to circulating documents&#xD;
and voting, Charles with a -hearty good will gave- his&#xD;
support to Hale and Julian.&#xD;
It is but proper to state here, and I wish it dis-&#xD;
tinctly understood, that Charles is no party man He&#xD;
is an absolute independent in politics as well as in&#xD;
everything else, and knows of no such thing in his&#xD;
ethics as fidelity to party---he prefers fidelity to prin-&#xD;
ciple. He knows well that there are demagogues-in&#xD;
all parties, and that the longer the party has been in&#xD;
existence the more -of them, the more corruption,&#xD;
and the more abandonment of principle. He'advo-&#xD;
cates such measures and votes for such men as at any&#xD;
lime he thinks most likely to forward the great inter-&#xD;
ists of humanity.&#xD;
Charles' political adventures did him good. They&#xD;
enabled him to study human nature more deeply, and&#xD;
ae did not fail to profit by his opportunities. He was&#xD;
aow well convinced that as no man could serve God&#xD;
nd Mammon, so no man could serve Hunkerism and&#xD;

&#xD;
his country ; that devotion to party and devotion to&#xD;
principle were utterly inconsistent. And inasmuch as&#xD;
the opposing of error is necessarily involved in an&#xD;
uncompromisin devotion to right, Charles learned&#xD;
that it was wholly impossible for any one to cultivate&#xD;
his intellectual and moral energies, make reason and&#xD;
conscience his guide, and not receive the censure of&#xD;
the ignorant, prejudiced and interested, who always&#xD;
have been "firm as a rock," and always mean to be.&#xD;
Charles thought about these things, and lamented&#xD;
them deeply; but mere regret would not answer-&#xD;
there must be actual working. The evil must be&#xD;
cured-and how can this be done? What do the&#xD;
people really need? It was clear enough to Charles'&#xD;
mind that the whole trouble consisted in an unde-&#xD;
veloped state of the intellect, and general ignorance.&#xD;
Education, therefore, was the remedy. Charles did&#xD;
what he could in this direction; consistent with his&#xD;
other labors. His farm duties and general studies&#xD;
prevented him from teaching, but he labored to in-&#xD;
fuse into others, and especially into the young, more&#xD;
liberal ideas concerning education. He organized a&#xD;
Teacher's Institute in his own county, visited other&#xD;
sections and lectured on education, encouraged teach-&#xD;
ers, and did all in. his power to dispel darkness by the&#xD;
diffusion of light.&#xD;
Charles had now been on his farm two years; but&#xD;
his sister was not with him, and it behooves us to&#xD;
inquire after her.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
MARY AND THE ,PREACHER.&#xD;
MARY was Charles' sister in _mind as well as by the&#xD;
ties of consanguinity. She observed and thought;&#xD;
and one of her sex who observIes and thinks, is not&#xD;
long in finding out that woman does not occupy the&#xD;
most desirable position in the society of boasted civ-&#xD;
ilization. She could see well enough that woman is&#xD;
much deferred to, but she learned to look upon this&#xD;
deference as the price which man pays her for the&#xD;
surrender of .rights justly hers.  She is taxed, and&#xD;
made amenable to laws which she is allowed no voice&#xD;
in making. The.avenues- to business are closed to&#xD;
her as they should not be; and-when permitted to&#xD;
labor, a just compensation is withheld;; and in con-&#xD;
sequence she is made dependent upon the other sex.&#xD;
If she would seek a social position of honor and re-&#xD;
spect, often, indeed, if she would avoid want aad mis-&#xD;
ery, and seek the means of a comfortable living, she&#xD;
is compelled to merge her existence into that of an-&#xD;
other. Being thus dependent, she often enters into&#xD;
-the most uncongenial-union, and in seekingprotection&#xD;
finds hopeless misery,&#xD;
But many cannot find .even so poor a refuge as&#xD;
this, and are forced into garrets and cellars to earn&#xD;
wherewith to live, by the slavery of eighteen or twen-&#xD;
ty long, weary hours of unremitting toil. This wears&#xD;
down the body, 'sinks the spirit* and then, in too&#xD;
many cases, does not serve its victims with the means&#xD;
of living. Desperate and distracted, many beaute-&#xD;
ous daughters of humanity, formed for love adIap-&#xD;

44              SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
piness, accept the wages of sin, and damn the soul&#xD;
to save the body.&#xD;
It is sad enough when such degradation is the re-&#xD;
sult of the necessity of food and clothing, but when&#xD;
it results from the morbid cravings of vanity, it seems&#xD;
harder still for humanity. Society,in the first place,&#xD;
fosters a passion for dress and show, then denies the&#xD;
means of its gratification, but opens up the paths of&#xD;
iniquity, points them out to its victims, and poor hu-&#xD;
man nature gives way. What a contemplation for&#xD;
any pure mind ! What admirer of civilization, with&#xD;
any purity of aspiration for himself and race, but&#xD;
must feel that civilization is not the embodiment of&#xD;
all that is good and lovely! -But, Chris tianity-lo!&#xD;
were is modern Christianity-and its votaries ?&#xD;
lIary was wondering all the while; but voices&#xD;
oane from the wealthy and well-provided-for, in the&#xD;
pulpit and elsewhere. Mary listened, and the voices&#xD;
-hollow enough they seemed--lauded society as it&#xD;
exists, boasted the blessings of civilization, and the&#xD;
wonderful things Christianity had done for the eleva-&#xD;
tion of woman. Mary felt grateful for what woman&#xD;
had already received, and thanked God for the prin-&#xD;
ciples and labors by which the blessings had been&#xD;
achieved. But she felt that much remained to' be&#xD;
de'ne; and why did not our regular and approved&#xD;
teachers seriously -take these things into hand, and&#xD;
consider the ways and means of realizing a practical&#xD;
redemption of the fallen? Mary did not like that&#xD;
spirit which could only see the good that had' been,&#xD;
but closed its eyes to that which might be. There&#xD;
was too, much self-complacency in this, and she could&#xD;
not help thinking that too many who profess concern&#xD;
for the race are more absorbed in their own person-&#xD;
al ease and comfort than in earnest labor for the good&#xD;
of others.&#xD;
But woman has just cause of complaint in other&#xD;
&#xD;
respects. She is' shut out from colleges and  m l&#xD;
schools, and thus denied the advantages these institu,&#xD;
tions afford for cultivating the mind and fitting- it for&#xD;
the pursuits of literature, science and. art.. Thiseis&#xD;
unjust, arbitrary, and unmanly, and Mary knew it.&#xD;
But the greatest wrong which woman endures, is&#xD;
the licentiousness of the other sex. -Man pollutes&#xD;
himself in all kinds of sexual vice, makes woman his'&#xD;
victim, and at the sametime demands not only that&#xD;
she shall be pure, but that at the sacrifice of a just&#xD;
individual freedom, she shall be' eternally giving him&#xD;
pledges of her innocence. She must watch with the&#xD;
utmost care over her every look, word and act, and&#xD;
never look, speak, or do   nything. which man, with&#xD;
the instrumentality of his perverted imagination, eag&#xD;
torture into a testimony against her. The nari w&#xD;
path is marked out for her, and if she Steps beyond&#xD;
it she is "done for." She, may be. as chaste as Di-&#xD;
ana, but if she disregards'the constraints of arbitrary&#xD;
conventionalism, she is fallen ; while the man who&#xD;
associates with harlots, and victimizes innocence,&#xD;
may walk bravely through the world- an honorable&#xD;
member of society.&#xD;
Mary had notenough of mock modesty and indel-&#xD;
icate squeamishness to prevent her from thinking, and&#xD;
sometimes conversing upon such topics as these,&#xD;
Although she regarded -taxation without represented,&#xD;
tion a wrong, yet she was not- convinced that the&#xD;
true remedy is to be found in extending. to woman&#xD;
the right of suffrage; and she thought that instead of&#xD;
urging this so strongly in woman's rights conventions,&#xD;
it would be better to adopt such measures as would&#xD;
remove from woman the unjust restraints of false&#xD;
delicacy, and from man 'the curse of emasculating in-&#xD;
dulgence. But then the thought occurred, that until&#xD;
woman achieves her pecuniary independence, she can&#xD;
do but little in her own behalf to shield herself from&#xD;
&#xD;

impurity and win man from the ways and by-ways&#xD;
of sin. How then is woman to escape her political&#xD;
wrongs? how open the channels of justly remuner-&#xD;
ative labor, and thus achieve her pecuniary indepen-&#xD;
dence? how obtain equal participation with man in&#xD;
the advantages of education? how promote her own&#xD;
purity and man's?   Here was a problem which&#xD;
Mary did not feel able to solve ; and while woman's&#xD;
rights conventions had not presented the whole prob-&#xD;
lem, she thought they had failed to obtain all the ele-&#xD;
ments of its solution. She resolved to await the fu-&#xD;
ture, for she saw by the light of a brilliant intuition&#xD;
that the combination which solves the problem would&#xD;
soon be for woman to employ. Mary was not nis-&#xD;
taken.&#xD;
Meantime, she came across a minister of the gos-&#xD;
pel, for whom she had formed an attachment when&#xD;
quite young. He had formerly resided in the same&#xD;
village with her parents, but had removed, was gone&#xD;
several years, and had now returned and taken upon&#xD;
himself the responsibility of his former charge..&#xD;
Mary proposed her difficulties, pretty much as I&#xD;
have stated them, and the preacher was very much&#xD;
shocked. He told her that all that ever had been ef-&#xD;
fected for the good of man had been done in a regu-&#xD;
lar way, and that it was to the sanctified efforts of&#xD;
the Church that she must look for the elevation of&#xD;
her sex. He gave her to understand that the scheme&#xD;
for the remedy of all these evils, was in full opera-&#xD;
tion, and that the reason why some were not blessed&#xD;
thereby was owing to the hardness of their own&#xD;
hearts.&#xD;
Here Mary interposed. She had not so much con-&#xD;
fidence in the regular way of doing things. She re-&#xD;
collected that Christ was a great outlaw and inno-&#xD;
vator in his day, and was put to death for his irregu-&#xD;
larities.  She thought of Luther ;-what a great&#xD;
&#xD;
disorganizer he was, and how he barely escaped be-&#xD;
ing thrust violently out of the world for his auda-&#xD;
cious onslaught upon the regular way they had in&#xD;
those days of serving their God.&#xD;
Mary had begun to see that mankind are much af-&#xD;
fected by circumstances, and that hardness of heart&#xD;
resulted fromthe unfavorable conditions under which&#xD;
its victims receive their being and are educated, -She&#xD;
thought that it- behooved the Church which assumed&#xD;
to take so much interest in man's welfare, to -see to&#xD;
the changing of these conditions, and remove the&#xD;
causes which produce hardness of heart. She could&#xD;
read human nature deeply enough to know-that sal-i&#xD;
vation of soul was a very difficult -thing when there&#xD;
was no-salvation for the body. The poor -toiler,&#xD;
crushed in body by his labor,and crushed in spirit by&#xD;
his cares and apprehensions, could not cultivate spir-&#xD;
ituality of mind. She stated these difficulties to her&#xD;
old friend, but it seemed that he could not understand&#xD;
them. He and she were looking at the matter from&#xD;
different points of view, and not only so, but-through&#xD;
different media, and so could not see alike.&#xD;
The Rev. Mr. Beldam grew very sanctimonious,&#xD;
and erected-himself into the attitude of a holy and&#xD;
infallible teacher, and began to inflict a lecture upon&#xD;
her after this fashion: "1 am very sorry,my dear, o&#xD;
see that you are getting led astray so young. - Those&#xD;
impudent women who are making so much ado about&#xD;
woman's rights, and are meeting in convention to&#xD;
take charge of temperance and other affairs which&#xD;
belong to men, are out of their sphere. They are&#xD;
unsexing -themselves, becoming masculine and irregu-&#xD;
lar, and I do hope, my dear Mary, that you will have&#xD;
nothing more to do with them. Look not to human&#xD;
effort for salvation. It is the Lord that rules amongst&#xD;
the armies and he alone can deliver.. In the Ghurch&#xD;
is God's ordained methodof grace, and to thatshould&#xD;

SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
you and all others look for comfort and happiness.&#xD;
We have no assurance in God's holy Word that there-&#xD;
is any redemption but by the blood of Christ; and&#xD;
those who are looking to -human agencies for help&#xD;
are infidels. Beware of them, , my dear; connect&#xD;
yourself with some of God's people, observe the pro-'&#xD;
prieties which society demands of your sex, and you&#xD;
will be happy."&#xD;
Mary listened attentively, but could not help feel-&#xD;
ing some contempt for the affectedness of his man-&#xD;
ner; though her emotions were those of pity more&#xD;
than any other. She loved to see people natural,&#xD;
and disliked affectation in any form, whether in a&#xD;
professor of righteousness or of fashion.&#xD;
"As to observing the proprieties which society de-&#xD;
mards of me," said she, "I am not sure that I can&#xD;
promise obedience, if at the same time I tm to al-&#xD;
low society to make its own application of the word&#xD;
'proprieties.' I choose rather to obey my own judg-&#xD;
ment and conscience, than bow to the tyrannical spirit&#xD;
of a corrupt society. I choose to be free in the right&#xD;
rather than a slave to conventional usage. Society&#xD;
robs woman of her just and honorable freedom, while&#xD;
it gives to man the most licentious and unwarranta-&#xD;
ble liberties, and against this I have the hardihood to&#xD;
protest most solemnly. Virtue requires a just liberty&#xD;
for her pathway, while tyranny and licentiousness&#xD;
are the extremes which lead on either hand to pools&#xD;
of vice and corruption.&#xD;
"And as to joining the Church, there are certain&#xD;
considerations which I must weigh well before I take&#xD;
such a step. I think we should never voluntarily&#xD;
place ourselves in any association but such as our&#xD;
judgment approves as a means of good. If I were&#xD;
to attach myself to any Church organization I should&#xD;
have to be assured that its intellectual, moral and spir-&#xD;
itual infuences are exalting rather than otherwise;&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS JT- 4OUIfE.&#xD;
but when look around me for anything of this kind&#xD;
I do not discover-it. Tis may be pride or wickede&#xD;
ness in me,,but I cannot help it.'&#xD;
Mr. Beldam retorted very promptly, and informed&#xD;
her in an oracular manner that it was"ahlogdthpr&#xD;
due to the natural depravity- of the heart, and war&#xD;
of grace."&#xD;
"You may be right in. this," said she, "but bef re&#xD;
I can think so I. must deny all that 1 realize as most&#xD;
noble in the constitution of ,my being. I feel ihait&#xD;
would be degrading myself to submit my conseience&#xD;
to the keeping of the Church, and I cannotresist the&#xD;
convictions of my nature."&#xD;
"You are in a state ofnature' saidthe preacher,&#xD;
"and cannot judge of these things&#xD;
"You are entitled to your opinion,'' responded Mary,&#xD;
"but I ;must be allowed to have mine.. When , Ie&#xD;
the Church erecting costly edifices, and neglecting&#xD;
the offices of charity; when Isee it selling seats in&#xD;
its temples to the highest bidder, and excluding the&#xD;

&#xD;
" I cannot help but feel," continued Mary, "that&#xD;
the Church is the very embodiment of the spirit of&#xD;
the world; that fashion, aristocracy and prejudice&#xD;
reign supreme. It has forsaken the primitive sim-&#xD;
plicity it exemplified when a positive power in the&#xD;
world, and allied itself with fashion, wealth and du-&#xD;
plicity, as the means of self-preservation in an age of&#xD;
insincerity, show, and mammon. When the Church&#xD;
lost its primitive virtues it was engulphed in political&#xD;
favoritism, then in the barbarism of the middle ages,&#xD;
and now in the corruption engendered of fashion and&#xD;
commerce.&#xD;
" Whenever I see the Church providing for the&#xD;
poor as well as the rich ; and its-devotees clothed in&#xD;
plainness and sincerity rather than in fashion and du-&#xD;
plicity; whenever I see them cultivating the chris-&#xD;
tian graces and worshipping the true God, rather&#xD;
than cultivating pride and vanity and bowing at the&#xD;
shrines of idolatry, I shall begin to consider whether&#xD;
I ought to connect myself with those who claim to&#xD;
be the-people of God. I never can rely upon the&#xD;
dead formalities of the Church for my salvation; nor&#xD;
will woman trust to an organization for her rights&#xD;
when it not only refuses to recognize them as hers,&#xD;
but fails to put in active force the means whereby she&#xD;
is to be elevated. It will not satisfy her to point to&#xD;
the Church and tell her that therein is to be found&#xD;
the -God-appointed means of deliverance, as, long as&#xD;
it trusts to the magic of its name and'its rites. If it&#xD;
would be relied upon, it must use those means which&#xD;
under the government of God are calculated to bring&#xD;
about the -results desired.; 'Until this is done :the faith&#xD;
and profession of the Church will avail nothing:for&#xD;
the gnat purposes of humanity. The rights, ceren~o-&#xD;

disposed to think very'highly of either. It sees to&#xD;
me that such Churies, such congregations, and sach&#xD;
greachers rely too much upon the miraculous infusion&#xD;
of grace, and not enough upon the means  hreby&#xD;
God has guaranteed unto his chosen the qualities 'of&#xD;

cultivates these unchristian qualities in the mindsof&#xD;
the teachers, and thence they are infused into the&#xD;
people, to become abiding traits of character. They&#xD;
are then at hand on all occasions to be used against&#xD;
whatever is distasteful to prejudice.&#xD;
" There are a few reformers in the country, who&#xD;
think, speak, and live without subservience to popu-&#xD;
lar opinion, and so have become so very obnoxious to&#xD;
some of their neighbors who love the slavery of sect&#xD;
and dislike freedom in others. -.These have not the&#xD;
mental power to cope with the 0 infidels,' as they-call&#xD;
them, and so they get a favorite preacher of theirs,&#xD;
who also practices law and sometimes runs foroffice,&#xD;
to go out and oppose 'infidel doctrines,' and if pos-&#xD;
sible overthrow infidel influence.&#xD;
"I heard one of his sermons, and if he has much of&#xD;
the grace with which God blesses his chosen, I should&#xD;
want to have as little of it as possible. .1 mustihow-&#xD;
ever, do him the justice to say, that part of his ser-&#xD;
mon was really good, better than generally comes from&#xD;
orthodox pulpits. It was rational and instructive-&#xD;
was a pretty good digest of some of the reform- doc-&#xD;
trines in their bearings upon man's relations:to truth.&#xD;
But then' the infidels' had to be disposed of, and this&#xD;
was done in a very summary way.-&#xD;
"«He does not know what 'their views are, but as&#xD;
he has learned that they are. not orthodox, he thinks&#xD;
they. must be something bad. He takes this for&#xD;
granted, and is not choice in his terms. He is a law-&#xD;
yer, as I said, and does not care to be very consistent&#xD;
in his logic, for it is not his purpose, at all to.convince&#xD;
the reformers of error, but. merely to excite preju-'&#xD;
dice against them, or rather deepen the prejudice&#xD;
which already exists, and thus utterly destroy their&#xD;
heretical influence..&#xD;
"But beside this, he betrays very palpably another&#xD;
motive, and that is the conciliating, of a little, of the&#xD;
&#xD;
popular good will for himself; for, as ,Lai4 heruns&#xD;
for office, and asrmyfriends are known to behere.&#xD;
tics and are unpopular, he could hardly talie a s:rer&#xD;
way of getting ito the good graces of:inany than-to&#xD;

deceived, but.we judge 'the tree _by its fruits, as the&#xD;
Scripture says.&#xD;
"He aims   blows more particularlyWa cetain&#xD;

of his manhood that has broken, the, chains. of eet&#xD;
and party, and set him free. 'But however this may&#xD;
be, it is all one with the man that pleads law and&#xD;
preaches.&#xD;
"When I heard him he spoke.,f believing-such&#xD;
doctrines as 'he supposes 'the infidels. of the nigh-&#xD;

"Subsequently, this same maan -and I don't know&#xD;
why I should have any delicacy about giving his narne,&#xD;
titles and all--it is the Rev. William Coldines, Esq.!&#xD;
Well, as I'was. going to observe, subsequently he re-&#xD;
peated a sirmilar invective, omitting the word' thing;'&#xD;
and instead of 'pity' and loathe,' using 'abhor' and&#xD;
0 detest.' " He spoke this time -more coolly and with&#xD;
such prefatory remarks as showed the thing to have&#xD;
been premeditated.&#xD;
" On a funeral occasion he once spoke of those who&#xD;
did not accept the orthodox notions of the resurrec-&#xD;
tion, as 'mushroom heads.' This, said in his bitter,&#xD;
domineering way, I thought would falliarshly on the&#xD;
ears of mourners; but perhaps they had a living, and&#xD;
therefore practical faith, in the doctrine of conquering&#xD;
nature by grace.' And then at the graveyard, he&#xD;
addressed the people, and in the course of his re-&#xD;
marks, referred to the great number present-it was&#xD;
- Sunday-as proof of the respectability of the parties&#xD;
-concerned ;-the deceased was late the wife of one&#xD;
they call a preacher, and otherwise well connected.&#xD;
This remark revealed more than the speaker designed&#xD;
it should. It opened up the secret chamber of his&#xD;
soul, and, in connection with other facts, betrayed the&#xD;
leading idea of the man; or, as a waggish friend of&#xD;
mine observed, 'It dashed up the platter and showed&#xD;
the filthy contents of the brazen bowl.' Just think&#xD;
of Jesus boasting the respectability of himself and&#xD;
followers ! -The respectable in those days were the&#xD;
Pharisees and Hypocrites, and who knows but such&#xD;
is too much the case in our times?&#xD;
"I could give other examples. It is an easy mat-&#xD;
ter to be a brave man in the pulpit, where no chance&#xD;
for reply is given, but some, even with this advantage,&#xD;
have -not the hardihood to attack 'infidels' in their&#xD;
presence, in this violent way, but do so amongst the&#xD;
faithful, with the design, no doubt, ofkeeping them so&#xD;

weakness of the .manrather than a necessity ofthe&#xD;
system. I say he was in error then  but since- that,&#xD;
for merely attending a spiritual circlewlth a view to&#xD;
candid investigation, he was assailed ifn an uiibrother.&#xD;
ly manner by those who called hit- brother.' then&#xD;
he began -to think, and now the: bonds areo brohkn,&#xD;

" We can hardly go to Church witifoit obtaining&#xD;
evidence in, some shape of the vindictiveness -of those&#xD;
who assume to be the followers of the meek and qw.&#xD;
ly Jesus. I was once at a quarterly meeting held in&#xD;
the grove, God's iving and only temple. The je&#xD;
siding elder was there as usual, and iim illustrating the&#xD;
mercy and 'forbearance of God, he said that it-far&#xD;
surpassed anything of the kind which belonged to&#xD;
the hard heart of man. He went on to prove this&#xD;
by referring 'to- the fact that a brother of-his who&#xD;
had been down the Mississippi -iiver, had before so&#xD;
'outdone' with the wickedness of sl.ve ow nersnd&#xD;

illustrating the great mercy of God, he betrayed the&#xD;
revengefl ness of himself and brother. If the spirit&#xD;
of Christ be love and meekness, it would seem that&#xD;
those have but little of it who betray such bitterness&#xD;
and enmity to erring brethren.&#xD;
"Be assured, my good friend, that I take no delight&#xD;
in recounting the errors and shortcomings of either&#xD;
classes or individuals, for in their sins we all suffer,&#xD;
and I regret these things for their sake as well as&#xD;
ours. But painful as this duty is, there are occasions&#xD;
when it must be done, and then it is notonly weak&#xD;
but wrong to suppress a candid statement of the facts.&#xD;
I have spoken frankly in my own defense, and have no&#xD;
apology to make. And in conclusion, you will permit&#xD;
me to say that while the Church finds it convenient to&#xD;
employ such teachers, and the professors of religion&#xD;
find it pleasant to receive such effusions from the pul-&#xD;
pit, I cannot find it in my soul to form any closer&#xD;
connection with them."&#xD;
The Rev. Mr. Beldam was astonished at the free-&#xD;
dom and power of Mary's manner, and felt himself&#xD;
utterly disarmed. He did not find it convenient-to&#xD;
stay longer, but made an excuse and left with the&#xD;
promise to call again. After recovering a little he&#xD;
found himself mentally repeating: "Caught a Tar-&#xD;
tar," "masculinity in petticoats," " virago," and such&#xD;
choice epithets. But although vanquished, he was&#xD;
not the man to stay vanquished-under such circum-&#xD;
stances.  Mary had been too much for him in,&#xD;
matters of theology, but might not be invincible&#xD;
otherwise, and as a long face had not served him he&#xD;
would try a bland one. He, discovered under her&#xD;
ponderous intellect a woman's heart, and he made&#xD;
some calculation upon this. -He was as .well versed&#xD;
in gallantry as. theology, if not better, and valued&#xD;
himself on Wittle private.conquests of this kind, riore&#xD;
than upos such as pertained to, the glory of his Mas-&#xD;
&#xD;
ter's kingdom. He did so, perhaps, because it was&#xD;
an affair of more personal interest, and excused&#xD;
himself with the reflection that, we all have our little&#xD;
weaknesses. As to Mary's .case, something whis-&#xD;
pered him that it was a doubtful one, but thiscould&#xD;
only be known by trying, and so he laid his p1anis&#xD;
In the interview already had, he was not more&#xD;
astonished at Mary than she was at herself. Her&#xD;
intellect was much excited, and, in the early part&#xD;
of her discourse- especially, she uttered, thou hts&#xD;
which had never crosssed her mind before. They&#xD;
came she did not know how, but she felt their truth&#xD;
and spoke them with the assurance of one inspired.&#xD;
The facts were just as she stated tlem, but she had&#xD;
never seen so clearly and widely their, bearings nod&#xD;
felt sostrongly the force of the principles they&#xD;
illustrated.&#xD;
She was a believer in spiritualism, but never sup-&#xD;
posed herself, a medium for the influx of thought,&#xD;
though she knew herself tQ be one for the rappings&#xD;
and it was not till afterwards that she realizedaher&#xD;
indebtedness in this conversation to aid from a higher&#xD;
sphere, The mental conditions requisite were ac-&#xD;
tive and not passive,,so.that they were not affected&#xD;
by .the -uncongenial presenceof the minister; Her&#xD;
inspiration-was that of genius.&#xD;
I should have said that what immediately Id to the&#xD;
conversation on theology and.womaswrongawere&#xD;
some remarks made on.the spiritual manibstations,&#xD;
about which=therewas considerable of excitement at&#xD;
the time in the neighborhood. -in thecourse of these&#xD;
remarks, Mary gave: the, minister to understadthai&#xD;
she was a medium. The good.man, f courserre-&#xD;
monstrated, and having become warmed up wktbis&#xD;
subjectfinally told her:&#xD;
"If yu have any carst 4pll for the re tsiof&#xD;

your family, let me implore you to give up this folly.&#xD;
Now let me tell you, one year will not pass, if you&#xD;
keep on with this stuff, till your reputation will be&#xD;
forever ruined. Almost without an exception, those&#xD;
who dabble in such trash, are infidel, lecherous fel-&#xD;
lows. If you live a few years it will make you&#xD;
blush as much to hear of receiving communications&#xD;
from spirits as to be accused of sheep-stealing: Will&#xD;
you not pause in this witch-hunting, and give your-&#xD;
self to reason? There is, to my mind, nothing more&#xD;
disgusting and utterly loathsome, than this new form&#xD;
of infidelity."&#xD;
I need hardly say that Mary was not pursuaded&#xD;
by this pathetic appeal; or that, as we- have seen,&#xD;
she convinced her monitor that she was somewhat&#xD;
given to reason.&#xD;
After Mr. Beldam left, Mary went over to see an&#xD;
acquaintance who was a member of his congregation,&#xD;
and whose name way Rachael. She was received&#xD;
very kindly, and way not there long till she saw. an&#xD;
d ladyrwho was also a member of the same Church,&#xD;
-coming that way with a vessel in her hand.&#xD;
"There, now," said Rachael, "comes that old&#xD;
thing again. She must not have good milk this time.&#xD;
Jiony, you must give her sour milk."&#xD;
By this time the old lady was at the door with a&#xD;
light heart, for she was sure of a warm welcome, as&#xD;
she knew from past experience. She rapped, and&#xD;
Rachael opened the door and exclaimed:&#xD;
.*' Why, dear sister Polly, is that you? how glad I&#xD;
in to see you-take a chair-how Are they all at&#xD;
houme-you have come for some more milk for that&#xD;
dr little pet-go, Jlnny, get the pitcher and bring&#xD;

Jiar understood it, and ot "last nights milk."&#xD;
Old mother Polly accepted: It very gratefully, and&#xD;
tstwdtasitb   slight stop* thiking of ht little&#xD;
&#xD;
grandchild, and thanking God   for such a kind&#xD;
neighbor. But when she got home she found that&#xD;
Jinny had made a mistake. She returned the next&#xD;
day, and when she informed Raphael of the accident,&#xD;
the kind, woman was confounded that such a thing&#xD;
should happen in her family, and expressed a great&#xD;
deal of regret:&#xD;
"O, these careless girls-I am the most vexed with&#xD;
them-they can do nothing right-4il declare,10i. they&#xD;
don't torment the life out of one. Jinny, you must&#xD;
mind what you are about another time-l charged&#xD;
you in particular to get sweet milk-if it, isn't&#xD;
too bad."&#xD;
Jinny was a sensible girl, and might have been&#xD;
amused, at such deceitfulness, had it not inflicted&#xD;
gross -injustice upon herself.. As it was she felt&#xD;
deeply wronged, and though she suffered. in the&#xD;
same way many a time, she found it hard .to get&#xD;
used to. The old lady seemed to be as innocent of&#xD;
what was behind the curtains as could be, and'Jinny&#xD;
stole a glance at her as much as to say: "Old folks&#xD;
don't know everything." But she was a servant; and&#xD;
so had to hold her peace. 'She was glad to get em-&#xD;
ployment. at' living wages, even if she had to be&#xD;
made the scapegoat of other people's sins.&#xD;
Mary was witness to part of this farce, and the&#xD;
rest she had from a reliable source.'- She felt sad to&#xD;
contemplate such corruption in the human heart, and&#xD;
especially in a human heart which the Church pro-&#xD;
fessed to have regenerated, and had now under its&#xD;
sanctifying influence. She almost concluded that&#xD;
the Church did not hold to the doctrine of totalde.&#xD;
pravity without reason. And this impression was&#xD;
strengthened by. the remark- of an old mother, iot in&#xD;
Israel, but in the fashionable world, that she= conn&#xD;
mended her Sons for visiting houses of prostitute&#xD;
and associating elsewhere wii lewd women asit&#xD;

made gentlemen of them and qualified them for&#xD;
society.&#xD;
Mary treasured up these facts. They may seem&#xD;
to be small niatters in themselves, but- they have a&#xD;
wonderful significance, and she saw it. There are&#xD;
difficulties in society and the'Church which seem to&#xD;
need explanation, and Mary was preparing, a dish of&#xD;
these wherewith to regale her clerical friend -on&#xD;
the occasion of his next visit, should he insist on the&#xD;
soundness of -society and orthodoxy. But the holy&#xD;
man made no occasion for anything of the kind.&#xD;
The next time he came Charles was there, and Mary&#xD;
in her Bloomer dress, and he was so mortally offend-&#xD;
ed that he turned round contemptuously and left.&#xD;
Like a respectable man, he showed that he had a&#xD;
care for his reputation. He had lamentable stories&#xD;
to tell about what kind of a young lady Mary&#xD;
Hopewell was:&#xD;
"1A masculine, impudent, saucy, precocious, gauk&#xD;
of a girl. She had a good deal of intellect, but that&#xD;
will only serve to sink her deeper into-the lake of&#xD;
unquenchable fire, unless she .speedily- repents and&#xD;
turns to the Lord. She reads' The Lilly,' is a stick-&#xD;
ler for woman's rights, infidel in her notions, and&#xD;
like other outlaws and disorganizers of her sex, she&#xD;
is imitating the male attire."&#xD;
Here he sighed deeply, or rather groaned, looked&#xD;
demure, and said: " I knew it was wrong, but I&#xD;
could not help looking at her trowsers."&#xD;
Thus ended the second visit. As Napoleon the&#xD;
First used to say, "there's but a step between the&#xD;
sublime and the ridiculous." How delusive and vain&#xD;
are all earthly hopes 1 and the Rev. Mr. Beldam&#xD;
might have preached a sermon to himself on- the&#xD;
penchant and puisance of luck to upset the best&#xD;
laid schemes. His petty vanity, in connection with&#xD;
large amativeness and combativeness, made a fool&#xD;
of him, first one way and then another.&#xD;
&#xD;
It is but meet that I should give a little of the subse-&#xD;
quent history of this man. His wife was still in the-&#xD;
East, and when he went for her, a Miss Gass, who&#xD;
had been teaching in the village, and wad a member&#xD;
of his Church,. made the tour with him. In the&#xD;
vicinity of Cincinnati he .introduced her as Mrs.&#xD;
Beldam, and at night they were shown to a room&#xD;
with two beds in it. They remained here 'about a&#xD;
month, and- then -went on- 'o Rhode-Island, where&#xD;
Mr. Beldam found his wife and Miss Gass her friends.&#xD;
Before her departure from the West;she had entered&#xD;
into a matrimonial engagement with a Mr. Waitson,&#xD;
also a teacher, and after her return from the East it&#xD;
was consummated with the usual solemnities.&#xD;
Everything went, on finely, and the happy hus-&#xD;
band was rejoicing in such a prospect as one in his&#xD;
situation loves to contemplate. But his astonishment&#xD;
and chagrin are more easily imagined than expressed,&#xD;
when he came to find that the realization of his&#xD;
hopes did not require the usual number of moons by&#xD;
three or four.&#xD;
The divine who was so shocked at that sight of a&#xD;
Bloomer dress, was thought to be the man. She&#xD;
declared herself utterly ignorant of -any clue, to the&#xD;
mystery, but could not deny the coincidence, and&#xD;
ventured to suggest that Mr. Beldam must have&#xD;
accomplished his nefarious purposes, by throwing&#xD;
her into a magnetic trance.&#xD;
This brought Mr. Beldam .into rather bad order&#xD;
with his friends, and as he was altogether too pro-&#xD;
slavery in his sentiments for that latitude, he went&#xD;
South and located in. Memphis. He had not been&#xD;
there long till he was found in company with a&#xD;
coarse German harlot, and for this -the Church cen-&#xD;
sured him as impudent I&#xD;
After all this, as might be supposed, Mary.Hope-&#xD;
well was not sorry that she had not been proselyted&#xD;

&#xD;
under his ministration. When quite young, and&#xD;
Mr. Beldam doubtless purer than in after life, she&#xD;
had formed quite an attachment for him, as I said,&#xD;
but when they met again she did not like his mag.&#xD;
netism. With her own invulnerable chastity and&#xD;
force of character, she triumphed completely over&#xD;
the impure influence of his presence, but she knew&#xD;
full well that there was something not right about&#xD;
the man, and she was glad that her Bloomer dress&#xD;
had frightened him away.&#xD;
Mary knew well that there were many good peo.&#xD;
ple in the Church, both amongst laity and clergy.&#xD;
She considered them exemplary Christians, and&#xD;
loved them as she did all sincere upright people ; but&#xD;
she thought that she knew equally well that they&#xD;
were not what they were by any virtues which the&#xD;
Church was instrumental in imparting, but rather&#xD;
in spite of its vicious influences. Though it is but&#xD;
just to say that she held the Church to exercise a&#xD;
restraining influence, which results in a kind of&#xD;
superficial moralism; but so far as the culture of&#xD;
pure, undefiled religion, or what is the same, the&#xD;
highest aspirations of the spiritual man, are con-&#xD;
cerned, the Church is a nullity ;.-it is worse, it is&#xD;
a dead weight upon the upward tendencies of hu-&#xD;
manity, and so Mary thought it. Those in the'Church&#xD;
who live true to their God-given nature, do so in&#xD;
consequence of the force of principle acting upon,&#xD;
or, I should say, within minds so fortunate in their&#xD;
constitution as to move triumphantly by the inher-&#xD;
ent energies of truth. But such minds she could see&#xD;
were too few, and not sufficiently influential in the&#xD;
Church to give it completion.  Mary concluded,&#xD;
therefore, to bide her time and await the develop-&#xD;
ments of the future ; and these she felt assured were&#xD;
about to do something more for the redemption and&#xD;
happiness of the race than the Church is aiming at.&#xD;

"written by a minister of New York City," to the brother&#xD;
of a lady who is a medium, and the second and third sen-&#xD;

Rachael first give covert orders to the maid one way, and&#xD;
then open ones the other, as stated in the text. 7. The&#xD;

MARY AND THE SCHOOLS.&#xD;
Immediately after her adventure with the preacher&#xD;
Mary found a vacant school near by, and upon appli-&#xD;
cation obtained it. The district was a larg one,and&#xD;
she employed an assistant. Several of the pupils were&#xD;
quite well advanced, and Mary was enabled to form&#xD;
such classes as she could take an interest in. She&#xD;
found a few liberal parents, and succeeded in getting&#xD;
a class in Phonetics. She had one also in Combe's&#xD;
Constitution of Man; and another,-of young ladie&#xD;
exclusively-in Physiology.&#xD;
- The latter became so much interested in the sub.&#xD;
ject of their studies, that she prevailed on them to&#xD;
-    take the Water-Cure Journal as the means of acqui&#xD;
ing additional information in regard to the health of&#xD;
body and mind. They were all, without exceptions&#xD;
endowed with rare good sense, 'and gave earnest&#xD;
heed to Mary's instructive teachings. "They soon&#xD;
learned that long draggle-tailed dresses operated&#xD;
against the wearer; and as to the comparative bea-&#xD;
ty of the short and long -skirts, after they became&#xD;
used to seeing it, they took a fancy to the style of&#xD;
Mary's Bloomer. But judgment sustained the fancy,&#xD;
and doubtless had much to do in creating it, sinie&#xD;
use, health, and beauty go together in the matter of&#xD;
personal comfort, as they learned from physiology&#xD;
and the Water-Cure Journal.  n short, the girls do-&#xD;
termined to have Bloomer dresses.&#xD;

&#xD;
This their prudent 'mothers, who very naturally&#xD;
wished their daughters to be proper, did not approve.&#xD;
They threw all the blame upon Mary and the Jour-&#xD;
nal. They conceived a great aversion to the " pic-&#xD;
tures" in the latter, and did not much like the "read-&#xD;
ing." Physiology and the Water-Cure were suspect-&#xD;
ed of being what they actually ought not to be--at&#xD;
least for young ladies to study; and so the vigilant old&#xD;
dames met in solemn conclave, and after due delib-&#xD;
eration resolved to ask advice of the " Doctor," who,&#xD;
being a man of education, age, and experience, un-&#xD;
derstood these things, and knew what was right.&#xD;
Well, Dr. Pilpepper, * a professional character of&#xD;
great celebrity, was duly notified, and upon making&#xD;
a brief diagnosis of the case, understood it perfectly,&#xD;
He has no high opinion of those who do not adminis-&#xD;
ter and are not administered to with orthodox drugs&#xD;
in the regular way, and as might be supposed, he dis-&#xD;
liked the reading in the Journal and the looks of the&#xD;
ugly pictures as heartily as the old ladies themselves.&#xD;
"And as to Physiology," said he, "it is not the thing&#xD;
for young ladies to study;" and his looks were signifi-&#xD;
cant and conclusive. The case was prescribed for and&#xD;
the Doctor left. The treatment was to be heroic; but&#xD;
there was no faltering. The numbers of the Journal&#xD;
already received were made to disappear mysterious-&#xD;
ly, and Uncle Sam brought no more to the post office.&#xD;
The teaching of Physiology was stopped, the books&#xD;
were anathematized, and I have no doubt put in con-&#xD;
finement, for they were not seen afterwards in public.&#xD;
a The author is not so inconsiderate and unjust as to insinuate&#xD;
that all who use drugs in the practice of the healing art, are op.&#xD;
poed-to the dress reform, and the teaching of popular Physiology.&#xD;
He knows that many are not, and to such as are liberal ansd pro-&#xD;
gressive, he does honor by a necessity of his nature. But though&#xD;
some are thus liberal, he cannot be blind to the fact that the great.&#xD;
est conservatives and bigots are to be found among the most ortho-&#xD;
dox, whether in the schools of theology or medicine.  .&#xD;
&#xD;
The principal causes thus. removed, nogdoubt was;en,&#xD;
tertained that the young ladies would immediately get&#xD;
well of the Bloomer fever. But no ; the cases were&#xD;
desperate ones-aggravated and prolonged by :the&#xD;
contagion of Mary's presence, and the too close prox-&#xD;
imity of the pestilential atmosphere of one another.&#xD;
As the symptoms were not mitigated in the least,&#xD;
but rather aggravated, as A said, the patients them-&#xD;
selves made an appeal to the good sense and affec-&#xD;
tion of their papas, and prevailed:on them to doctor&#xD;
on the Homaeopathic principle, though not altogether.&#xD;
in Homopathic doses. The dresses were got.&#xD;
The girls were glad enough.; but soon -found them-&#xD;
selves sneered at and persecuted till they almost&#xD;
wished, that the new costume " was in Guinea," as&#xD;
one of the old ladies was in the habit of saying. .. But&#xD;
Mary was heroic, could herself stand against the cur-&#xD;
rent of popular odium -,and assist others to do so.&#xD;
And besides, a few sensible young men in the vil-&#xD;
lage and vicinity, with Charles at their head, whose&#xD;
imaginations were chaste and afetions, pure, ape&#xD;
proved of the movement from the first, as ona de-&#xD;
manded by health, sense, and decency. They came&#xD;
to the assistance ,of their sisters and friends, and en-&#xD;
deared themselves to Mary and her pupils by ,their&#xD;
timely encouragement and kind regards. The Bloorn-&#xD;
ers triumphed.&#xD;
Charles made some observations during ths con-&#xD;
flict which added to the stock of his philosophy.&#xD;
Whenever the sight of a Bloomer caused smirksand&#xD;
grimaces, and drew forth low remarks and vulgar&#xD;
jests from any man, married single, he soonlearned&#xD;
by recalling past observation upon the individual, aid&#xD;
watching him closely at the time, to know - that it&#xD;
would be unsafe for one of the other sex who valued&#xD;
her purity to trust herself to such company,:eve if&#xD;
the skirts of her dress. were ever so long. Mary, too,&#xD;
&#xD;
AND,. AS IT. SHOULD BE*&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC7393-00000035"/>&#xD;
AND AS IT SHOULD BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
observed that the most uncertain of her own sex de-&#xD;
rided the new style of dress just in proportion to the&#xD;
anxiety they felt for their own respectability; while&#xD;
those puffed up with vanity and false pride showed&#xD;
a bitterness of opposition measured by the littleness&#xD;
of their intellects and the deceitfulness of their hearts.&#xD;
Those of both sexes with generous natures, pure af-&#xD;
fections, and expanded intellects, were respectful ii&#xD;
their behavior and approved of the new style.&#xD;
But Charles and Mary were set to thinking in a&#xD;
different direction. They saw how difficult it is for&#xD;
persons with the best motives to carry out their&#xD;
views in a practical way; especially if the practical&#xD;
conflicts with established usage, however vicious. It&#xD;
can only be done, as they discovered, by braving a&#xD;
storm of slander and persecution, and witnessing an&#xD;
exhibition of the ugliest pull-down passions of unde-&#xD;
veloped humanity. It is painful to contemplate such&#xD;
ebullitions of vileness; and there are but few who&#xD;
can withstand the storm. They alone can do so&#xD;
who are self-poised above the regions of sense and&#xD;
sordidness. But even with these it was disagreeable,&#xD;
and such was the experience of Charles and Mary.&#xD;
We love the interchange of sympathy with our fel-&#xD;
low men; but when the streams of mutual good feel-&#xD;
ing cease to flow, and still more when torrents of&#xD;
enmity and opposition rage against us, do we feel&#xD;
the want of that source of happiness which arises&#xD;
from the kind regards of those around us, and have&#xD;
but to look to the sympathy above us, and that which&#xD;
is before us. The fraternal regard of our brethren&#xD;
in the flesh is present and tangible, and there are few&#xD;
who do not consider it paramount, and none but are&#xD;
happier therewith when it is not incompatible with&#xD;
heaven and the future.&#xD;
All the trouble of conflicting tastes and usages&#xD;

erance which grows out:of it; and in the next, from&#xD;
the indiscriminate huddling together qf all sorts ot&#xD;
people in the same community. The liberal and ad-&#xD;
vancing are thus cut off from sympathy, and so far&#xD;
as it is possible, put in torture by the ignorant and&#xD;
conservative; though it is gratifying ,to know that&#xD;
they suffer far less than their persecutors suppose.&#xD;
.The same spirit obtains still that did in the rack and&#xD;
dungeon days of the Romish Inquisition; and though&#xD;
the racks and dungeons are removed, ytthere are&#xD;
the daggers of the eye, the venom-of the tongue, and&#xD;
enginery of social oppression; and these are used.&#xD;
Charles and Mary-had been studying the -Hai'mo-&#xD;
nial Philosophy, and were, well pleased with the doc-&#xD;
trine therein taught concerning the-next sphere. No&#xD;
clashing of sects, parties,- castes, and- classes; but-the&#xD;
kindred associate together in love and harmony,-how&#xD;
glorious ! And then they thought of the prayer:&#xD;
May it be done on earth as it-is in heaven ;-=-and they&#xD;
prayed that this good time would speedily come.&#xD;
4 But," said Charles, "we must act. Why might&#xD;
not the kindred yield to the laws of social attraction,,&#xD;
locate together, and enjoy- each other. Espeia1y,&#xD;
why might not the friends of radical 'and thorough&#xD;
reform come out from their present isolation; co-op-&#xD;
erate for the good. of themselves and others, go up&#xD;
into the mountains and hilltops, unite their torches&#xD;
and flare them overvalley and plain. Inunion there&#xD;
is strength,-and they would domore good. - Incon-&#xD;
genial association there -is harmony and, happiness,&#xD;
and if the more advanced but willed it, heaven fight&#xD;
begin on earth." Mary, who was indeed -a seeress,&#xD;
saw at that moment a vision of the future and .he&#xD;
"times," and bade Charles be of good cheer: "It:is&#xD;
for us," said she.&#xD;

against her as a teacher was becoming vociferous.&#xD;
The triumph of the new style of dress only increased&#xD;
the dissatisfaction with many, and they gave their&#xD;
efforts a new direction. Some of the more knowing&#xD;
ones had been looking with an inquisitive eye into&#xD;
Combe's Constitution of Man, and made the discovery&#xD;
therein that Mary was teaching infidelity in her&#xD;
school. The preacher Coldines was invited, and&#xD;
with a full determination to put a stop to such man-&#xD;
ifestations of depravity, he delivered himself of a ser-&#xD;
imon which was designed to wake up the righteous&#xD;
to an effort in behalf of religion itself.&#xD;
The Phonetic class was doing well, and the parents&#xD;
of the children were well pleased with their progress;&#xD;
hut the class was a great bugaboo. The teacher&#xD;
was going to corrupt the language and spoil the&#xD;
children for the attainment of correct English. She&#xD;
was transferring pupils back to the dark ages, and&#xD;
making barbarians of them. Some of the more vigil-&#xD;
ant were on the qui vive for a trick in some way, and&#xD;
sure enough they detected it. Both the principal&#xD;
and her assistant were paying more attention to the&#xD;
objectionable classes than to the others! Complaints&#xD;
were forthwith made, and the neighborhood put into&#xD;
a perfect ferment.  The current set too strongly&#xD;
against her, and before the six months had expired&#xD;
Mary was compelled to give up her school.&#xD;
But she was not sorry for her own sake. She had&#xD;
some warm friends, and their disinterested sympa-&#xD;
thy was to her a prelibation. on earth of what is to&#xD;
be hereafter in heaven. Those who were not her&#xD;
friends were so broad in their prejudices, and nar-&#xD;
row in their souls, that, under any circumstances,&#xD;
there could have been but few points of sympathy&#xD;
between them, and she cared but little fob their abuse.&#xD;
She was in the morning of an existence which is to&#xD;
last forever, and she did not allow herself to be seri-&#xD;
&#xD;
I '&#xD;
&#xD;
ously disturbed by the untoward events of a day.&#xD;
She realized with-an ever-present consciousness-the&#xD;
magnitude of her destiny,as one made in the image&#xD;
of God, and was noble in. the realization..&#xD;
But she did care for the children who were sub-&#xD;
jected to such vitiating influences. For youthful be-&#xD;
ings, with life before~ them and a long immortality,&#xD;
thus to have their tender minds seared with, preju-&#xD;
dice, and corrupted with falsehood and the evil ex-&#xD;
ample of ignorant and sordid parents, was a sad thing&#xD;
for Mary's pure and enlightened mind to content-&#xD;
plate; but it was even so.&#xD;
"True education," thought Mary," is the sole&#xD;
remedy for such wrongs; but-how is true education&#xD;
ever to work redemption, when it is repelled by such&#xD;
barbarian hands? But ignorance and wrong cannot&#xD;
always triumph, and that is my solace. 1 have been&#xD;

to do what'I have-done, and-though tinen evile'ame&#xD;
and curse me,l lave a proud consciousness within&#xD;

with aninward joy which 'was too deep for'any other&#xD;
utterance. O 'there are beautiful things:in earth,&#xD;
and humanity is not all depraved. Innocencepmaiden&#xD;

once thought of this, as they seldom attended the&#xD;
preachings and did not think to calculate for the&#xD;
habits of others. But when they got there, they&#xD;
were soon made aware-of their mistake.&#xD;
"Have you come," said their host, " tokeep my&#xD;
wife away from meeting?"&#xD;
" No indeed,- we have not," said Mary, taken a&#xD;
good deal by surprise.&#xD;
" I understand," continued he," that you reform-&#xD;
ers want to exercise a great deal of influence, on the&#xD;
plea that it is your duty to propagate your infidel&#xD;
faith.&#xD;
" We do think it our duty, and also our -interest,&#xD;
socially and spiritually," said Mary, "to teach what&#xD;
we deem truth ; but we are not of that class of phi-&#xD;
* losophers who think that the end justifies the means;&#xD;
and so we take no underhand, indirect ways of pros-&#xD;
elyting our neighbors; but what we are, we are&#xD;
boldly, and ask odds of none. I fear that you are&#xD;
judging us by your own standard. It is well known&#xD;
that the abettors of the popular faiths are at especial&#xD;
* pains to keep their children and -friends away from&#xD;
the teachings of liberal doctrihies, lest they might be-&#xD;
come infected with the contagion of infidelity. By&#xD;
such a course they betray a want of confidence in&#xD;
the power of their own dogmas over the human&#xD;
mind ; and hence the means to which they resort are&#xD;
such-as bigots and tyrants must always use to keep&#xD;
down the native aspirations of the soul. As direct&#xD;
moral means are powerless for so unworthy an end,&#xD;
they have recourse to such as are indirect and&#xD;
physical.&#xD;
"I say we are no part nor parcel of such a class&#xD;
of religionists. We have full confidence in the pow.&#xD;
er of truth over the human mind, and believing that&#xD;
we, have truth, we are perfectly willing that our" dis-&#xD;
ciples shall hear the reasons for any- faith, however&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
different from o~ts. We can afford to b cha igble,&#xD;
liberal, and tolerant."&#xD;
"And so can we,".said her neighbor,;whoa4uij&#xD;
illustrated in so very practical a way the legiimate&#xD;
result ofhis own -misanthropic sfait, -Ali gQ4&#xD;

" As to the precepts of'the.New,  etan'til&#xD;

"'tis a pity that: those who accept- thenm y piofe-&#xD;

of this religious instinct are very different, according&#xD;
to the different stages of mental 'development to&#xD;
which they pertain. Pagan worshippers bow down&#xD;
to material images of their own make; some, indeed,&#xD;
to idal- gods -of' their own- imagining,-and this is&#xD;
the case with the sects. Their Protean god is not&#xD;
the God of the universe; but we greatly prefer that&#xD;
they should worship him than give no expression to&#xD;
the religious instinct. To attempt to deprive them&#xD;
of their god, or by any means keep them away from&#xD;
their sanctuaries, is far from our intentions.&#xD;
t   I will say, that what we do aim at is to develop&#xD;
the mind out of its ignorance and materialism, so that&#xD;
it may see the undeveloped character of its religion,&#xD;
and adopt such 'means of grace' as are more in har-&#xD;
mony with the attributes of God and man, better&#xD;
calculated to gratify the spiritual aspirations of the&#xD;
soul, and lead it forward in the path of its destiny.&#xD;
We cannot 'engraft our views upon an undeveloped&#xD;
mind. We cannot, if we would, take away from it&#xD;
the object of its worship. It spontaneously creates&#xD;
its own god, and could not by any means-see where.&#xD;
hf lay the efficacy of our iconoclasm. It cannot en-&#xD;
ter the sanctuary of our temple. This is a moral im-&#xD;
possibility, and if wrong, charge God, and not us,-&#xD;
he has made it so. The highest aspirations do not&#xD;
inspirit an uncultivated mind. The germ is there,&#xD;
bat it is undeveloped. Until, therefore, others can&#xD;
enter our temple; we are not so unjust and cruel as&#xD;
to shut them out from others.&#xD;
" I am sorry we called at such a time; had we&#xD;
thought of your meeting we should not have come;&#xD;

we' would consider it wrong to step between you&#xD;

chained by the nragic of Mary's  agnetism, and&#xD;
responded "good bye," without knowingthat he did&#xD;
so. He would gladly halve dispensed with" her gle-&#xD;
ture, but after the one remark, he lost all power of&#xD;
utterance, and was compelled to listen toevery word.&#xD;
The ideas,though he could not appreciate thermall,&#xD;
seemed to enter his mind, as he said afteweddy&#xD;
some kind of sorcery, and theyamadasuch-an.im-&#xD;
pression thathe never got rid of it.&#xD;
Mary and her companion went homeward 1ess&#xD;
gaily than they 'came 'and it was'sometime before&#xD;
the silence was broken. At length Mary said,&#xD;
" How sad that immortal minds are thus buried&#xD;
up in the rubbishof the old theologies! And  yhat&#xD;
wrongs they unwittingly endure! Evenordinary&#xD;
penetration and brotherly charity, seem to forsake&#xD;
them. They become suspicious of others and im-&#xD;
pugn their motives. This wrong obtains-rn~ae, if&#xD;
possible, with priest than layman.- it was. Coldines'&#xD;

brought forth, though mnot ' an hundred fold' 'by 'nuy&#xD;
means, yet scripturally enough, after its own kind.'&#xD;
But as St. Simon said, ' The future is ours.'"&#xD;
After the brother had come fairly to hidielf and&#xD;
considered the matter overhe sat down andad-&#xD;
dr'essed a note to Maiybegging pardon for wkat he&#xD;
had done, asking her to, return at her ealiest con-&#xD;

simple that the humblest mind can comprehend'it, while,&#xD;
it is,so philosophical that the greatest intellectssthe world&#xD;
has ever produced, could not but express their adgiiration.&#xD;
It is, indeed, the religion of all people and tongues, and I&#xD;
am sorry that you do not accept it."&#xD;
To this Mary briefly replied:&#xD;
" As to our principles, ' abstruse' is not the word which&#xD;
expresses their quality. They are plain, simple, and easi-&#xD;
ly coniprehended. But it requires a mind with an un-&#xD;
shackled intellect ; and this can only be the case when,&#xD;
by proper cultivation, the prejudices of a false education&#xD;
have been rooted out. This is the beginning, and hence-&#xD;
forth the acceptation of truth is the work of endless pro-&#xD;
gress. Paul's proselytes were nourished first on milk-&#xD;
meat was too strong; and it is just so with ours.&#xD;
"It is a common remark that the phild must 'creep be-&#xD;
fore it can walk.' Everhimg that relates to man is pro-&#xD;
gressive. The physical powers of the body' are made&#xD;
stronger by constant use; the. artist does not become a&#xD;
proficient in a day; nor the man of science master of its&#xD;
principles in an hour. These things are realized only by&#xD;
a compliance on the part of the subject with the requisite&#xD;
conditions. Universal analogy prevails, and the "grarid&#xD;
principles of our spiritual philosophy are no exception.&#xD;
They cannot enter the sanctuary of the mind, unless the&#xD;
doors of the understanding are unlocked.&#xD;
"As to the great intellects .that have admired the.phi-&#xD;
losophy of the old theologies, as they have culminated in&#xD;
the dogmas of the sects, I would observe that great intel-&#xD;
lects are not always the accompaniments of great minds.&#xD;
They sometimes take very material views of man and his&#xD;
destiny. If the fact that great intellects with great sci-&#xD;
entific attainments, have accepted your dogmas, proves&#xD;
them philosophical, what does the fact" that great intel-&#xD;
lects with great scientific attainments have not accepted&#xD;
them, prove?  But again; in ancient times, as great intel-&#xD;
lects as the world has ever known-your own champions&#xD;
sitting in judgment,-did actually recognize the pagan&#xD;
views of religion with which they were surrounded. Now,&#xD;
&#xD;
if the fact that a great intellect, or a great mind accepts&#xD;
any system of faith,:proves it philosophical and true, then&#xD;
does the fact that a great-intellect or great mind accepts&#xD;
another system of faithprove it philosophical and true&#xD;
also. Now, the truth.is, men are apt to accept that faith b;&#xD;
in which they are educated, ana great intellects, and in&#xD;
some respects greatminds, are no, excetion&#xD;

his farm, Mary went along to do the "house-keepigg,"&#xD;
and take care of the garden. She was a proficient&#xD;
in both these arts, and very fond of thelatter. But&#xD;
when Charles began to see the,-4isadyartage of isola,.&#xD;
tion in his department of labor,. she discovered the&#xD;
same in hers. It seemed that it-required half her&#xD;
time to do the cooking for. themselves and one hand.&#xD;
She calculated that something like tWie the amount&#xD;
of labor wopld serve three times ts many persons&#xD;
supplied at the same table. Multiply this numberby&#xD;
nine, prepare the food for all in one kitchen suitably&#xD;
furnished with cooking aparatus, and the savng:&#xD;
would greatly, exceed fifty per-cent.&#xD;

78                 socirr  AS IT is&#xD;
&#xD;
sequent observation confirmed her in this opinion.&#xD;
She saw with pain the drudgery of women in mod-&#xD;
erate circumstances, who have the care of several&#xD;
small children. 'She could recall some, who in their&#xD;
girlhood days, were wont to use the means of men-&#xD;
\tal ulture,:and bid fair "to, be something ;" but now&#xD;
that they had been five years married wom en, she&#xD;
saw them struggling in the slough of life, intellectual-&#xD;
ly swamped.- She observed in some families, in which&#xD;
the mother did not become such at too early an age,&#xD;
that the oldest children-although the youngest should&#xD;
have been--were the most intellectual, and altogeth-&#xD;
er the best specimens of humanity; and this, tried&#xD;
by the principles of hereditary descent, she referred&#xD;
to the increasing drudgery of the mother, which not&#xD;
only dwarfed her own mind, but vitiated the consti-&#xD;
tution of her children.&#xD;
Mary grew weary of contemplating such slavery,&#xD;
and the evils necessarily attendant thereon, and&#xD;
wished with all her soul that men and women would&#xD;
be wiser and establish such social conditions as would&#xD;
insure more leisure for the cultivation of what is no-&#xD;
ble in human nature, and more abundant means for&#xD;
the gratification of the highest aspirations of our be-&#xD;
ing. She longed for employment conducted on more&#xD;
rational principles, and it was not long till she found&#xD;
it. She was invited to engage as teacher in a Union&#xD;
School, in a neighboring county, and 'after making&#xD;
due inquiry as to what would be demanded of her,&#xD;
she accepted the place upon the terms offered.&#xD;
The school is located among the most-intelligent&#xD;
and liberal people.' Teachers are allowed to be true&#xD;
to their destiny as men and women ; and it is ex-&#xD;
pected that they shall develop the youthful mind&#xD;
upon the true principles of education. Phoietics,&#xD;
Physiology, Phrenology, and Magnetism are taught&#xD;
as-regular branches; and lectures given on Psyehol-&#xD;
&#xD;
ANt s I sLsern BE.       79&#xD;
ogy, Neurology, Physiognomy, and kindred objects&#xD;
of the highest-interest to inquiring ninde  Particular&#xD;
attention ispaid to the trainingof thethinkig powers.&#xD;
The design is to educate the wholemnd and tojths.&#xD;
end the intellectfis developed in its tuerelations of&#xD;
harmony with the affections and sentiments. The&#xD;
pupils are taught tb judge nothing by mere prejudice,&#xD;
prepossession; or desire, but: to consider: any subject&#xD;
thoroughly and impartially, ands then decide accord-&#xD;
ing to their evidence.--They. are instructed'tdocarry&#xD;
this rule into all the departments of sciencekphiloso,&#xD;
phy, religion, politics, medicine, and the :every-day&#xD;
affairs of life. it is strictly enjoined, on them-not to&#xD;
rely upon others for thought and sentiiment, but al.&#xD;
ways upon themselves; to be social and friendly, but&#xD;
independent.&#xD;
Another system of education adopted -here, is that&#xD;
all the conventionalities of an aristocratic and cowupt&#xD;
society are wholly discarded. The pupils.are taught&#xD;
to address each other by their proper' names, ith-&#xD;
out any prefixes or affixes ;n and other rule strictly&#xD;
enjoined, is: "Let your communication be;yea, yea;&#xD;
nay, nay; that is, simple and plain, for whatsoever is&#xD;
more than these cometh of evil."  All are instrcted&#xD;
to pass for what they are, without any attetnpt at&#xD;
fashionable-airs or extra refinement. Elocation is&#xD;
taught orally in every class. All are accustomed to&#xD;
the clearest and most distinct enunciation.;Ev.&#xD;
ery elementary sound of the word .is vigorously&#xD;
exacted. This iakes some difficulty with 4 few&#xD;
who are generally in attendance from the:neigh-&#xD;
boring-city, and whose speech has been 'corruptedby&#xD;
contact with fashionable -society. it is difficult far&#xD;
these to substitute rfor sthe iasal twang, thatunramis&#xD;

&#xD;
Mary was pleased with this way of proceeding,&#xD;
and all enchanted with her new situation,. What&#xD;
made it the more delightful, was, that not only -the&#xD;
teachers, but nearly all the patrons were strongly&#xD;
in favor of the plan adopted, and did, by their influ-&#xD;
ence at home, what they could to -further the design&#xD;
of education at school. There were but very few&#xD;
who felt any dissatisfaction, and they objected. to&#xD;
nothing but the exclusion of the falses which pertain&#xD;
to society as it is. One of these once said to Mary,&#xD;
that he thought it a poor way to educate young per-&#xD;
sons for the world, into the active business of which&#xD;
they would soon be called to act their part. Mary&#xD;
replied, that if not the best, plan for this world, it cer-&#xD;
tainly is for the next, and that they chose to educate&#xD;
people for the eternal future, rather than for a few&#xD;
fleeting years on earth. She went on to say, that&#xD;
education is the business of a lifetime, and of a whole&#xD;
eternity, and not merely of~a few years in the morn-&#xD;
ing of existence.&#xD;
" But," said her friend, "life in this world is life as&#xD;
we find it, and our children must enter upon its ex-&#xD;
periences, whether good or evil, and it seems to me&#xD;
that they should be educated with this end in view."&#xD;
"1 I should prefer," said Mary, "to give a true edu-&#xD;
cation, with reference to the true ends of our being.&#xD;
If we are to overlook the long ages of the future, and&#xD;
the real destiny of man, for the falses of present ex-&#xD;
istence, and model our system of education accord-&#xD;
ingly, then indeed is it a sad thing for humanity.&#xD;
Success in life, under false conditions of society, re-&#xD;
quires falsehood in the individual; and it seems to&#xD;
me that every well-meaning-parent should prefer the&#xD;
simplicity of a true education, to the inculcation of&#xD;
that laxity of principle which is more likely to insure&#xD;
a brilliant career, through. life. What the. world&#xD;
thinks brilliant and what we know to be happiness,&#xD;
&#xD;
are very different things. The honors of wealth, of;&#xD;
ficial trust, social consequence, and-much that the&#xD;
world names 'great,' are fraught with more pain&#xD;
than pleasure, as their votaries tell us ;. and. even&#xD;
they, spiritually undeveloped as they are, do not re-&#xD;
alize the vast preponderance of evil against them.&#xD;
A true education may not do -much toward giving&#xD;
capacity, under existing social donditions, for,the&#xD;
acquisition of such honors, and- the fulralization of&#xD;
what is called success; but it leads-light along the&#xD;

CHAPTER V.&#xD;
* '    CHARLES AND THE STRANGER.&#xD;
MAY had found kindred spirits, and lived amidst&#xD;
the joyous reciprocation of 'a full tide of sympathy.&#xD;
She was anxious to have Charley there too, bbt he&#xD;
had --no* become closely engaged in the study of a&#xD;
science, from which he expected much goaio to the&#xD;
human race, and as he wished to reserve all 'the&#xD;
energies of his mind for this, and such study and&#xD;
miscellaneous reading as he felt attracted to, he did&#xD;
not think' proper to engage in teaching. He had&#xD;
Odardely ang sympathy where he was, but was so&#xD;
deeplyfinterested in the prosecution of his intellect-&#xD;
ual pursuits, and had so extensive a correspondence&#xD;
'fot one so young, that he contrived to make him-&#xD;
self qnite contented. He had taken an industrious&#xD;
friend, with a family, into partnership with him on&#xD;
the farm, and to arranged the conditions that he'was&#xD;
seldom obliged to labor more than was agreeable to&#xD;
his tastes, and necessary to the health of the body,&#xD;
and vigorous action of the mind. This requisite&#xD;
amount of physical labor, Charles. found in his own&#xD;
case to. be about thirty hours per week. Being of&#xD;
an active temperament, he could not do with less,&#xD;
and he generally selected from taste that kind of&#xD;
work which called the greatest number of muscles&#xD;
into vigorous action. This portion of his time thus&#xD;
spent in productive industry, he found, with econo-&#xD;
my, to be abundantly sufficient, even in isolation,&#xD;
situated as he was, to satisfy all the wants of the&#xD;
body; and as to the wants of the mind, he was coun-&#xD;
&#xD;
tent with a prelibation, at present, of what the future&#xD;
would supply in more copikus diraughts.&#xD;
Charles had now made an acquaintance in which&#xD;
he saw the promiserof good, and how this came about&#xD;
I may as well divulge.&#xD;
He had been getting more and more weary of the&#xD;
vexations of isolation." Once, in sellitig a lot of farm-&#xD;
stock for one hundred dolais, he was cheated out of&#xD;
about twenty-five. He was busy at the time' study-&#xD;
ing Brown's Lectures on the Mind, and did not like&#xD;
to take time from his agricultural duties to weigh the&#xD;
stock, and so trusted, to the smooth tongue of the&#xD;
buyer who was reputed to have "grace," and in&#xD;
whose profession to do the fairthing, hethought he&#xD;
might confide. Simple young mnan f  Silly  even&#xD;
as tried by the world's -standard. Mr. Misty,:the&#xD;
hog-merchant, said they could reckon very nearly&#xD;
what the weight would be, and'that he would rather&#xD;
allow more than go to the trouble of weighing ; and&#xD;
after they had agreed upon the figure, he, said that&#xD;
it was about a. "fair average ;" atid the' words&#xD;
came as firm, kind, clear, and sonorous as if an angel&#xD;
had coined them, Charles said Mr. Misty -seemed&#xD;
like a clever honest man; but for this his neighbors&#xD;
all laughed right at him. They- said that Charies&#xD;
had "larnin" enoogh-=_too much, infact,.for hiso wn&#xD;
good, but "knowed nothin about makinia bargain ;-&#xD;
and to be dull at a bargain was to be next thing to&#xD;
no man at all."  But-the fact is, Charles was made&#xD;
for fraternity and not fovselfishness.&#xD;
He was getting' initiated into an. understanding of&#xD;
the mysteries of societyand found that he hadLto be&#xD;
eternally watching for so he discovered allhis neigh-&#xD;
bors did, If he had only a coat or pair of pantiloons&#xD;
to purchase, he had to "keep a skinned eye,"-as, the&#xD;

some of his neighbors, who had made. this matter&#xD;
the study of life, and took delight in putting their&#xD;
theories into practice, could generally buy for seven-&#xD;
ty-five cents what invariably cost him a dollar- or&#xD;
more.&#xD;
An old friend of Charles',- who heard that he was&#xD;
beginning to think about association, wrote him to&#xD;
show the futility of such an extravagant notion, and&#xD;
told him that the safest way in the end' was to trust&#xD;
nobody but himself, and treat every man in his busi-&#xD;
ness relations as a rogue. Charles had experience&#xD;
enough to know that this was only too true in the&#xD;
antagonism of existing society. And 0 how often&#xD;
did it give him a heavy heart to contemplate and&#xD;
experience these conditions of eternal warfare -and&#xD;
distrust amongst those who should be brothers 1' He&#xD;
could realize amongst his dearest friends how&#xD;
delightful it was to give and receive, confidence, .and&#xD;
mingle the holiest sympathies of the human heart ;-&#xD;
and then what a chilling contrast, upon going out&#xD;
into the world, to find in every man with whom&#xD;
'he had dealings, an enemy !&#xD;
"Must these things always be," said Charles to&#xD;
himself in the moments of his deepest agony ;-"will&#xD;
man always be so -blind as thus to curse himself to&#xD;
gratify the yearnings of selfishness? It would in-&#xD;
deed-seem so, for I can scarcely find one around me&#xD;
that ever dreams of realizing anything better, and in&#xD;
their meekness, or rather sordidness, they seem con-&#xD;
tent with things as they are. 'They regard them as&#xD;
fixed and immutable,  md go oti without wishing or&#xD;
striving for higher conditions. Some indeed talk of a&#xD;
millennium, but they place it away in the far off&#xD;
future; or, if they suppose it near, they expect it to&#xD;
be brought about miraculously and in the twinkling&#xD;
of an eye. They' are as far from laboring in'the&#xD;
preparation of earth for the New Jerusalem, as those&#xD;
who nver&amp;amp; expect it to descend.  dtBuIwill not&#xD;

despair. The state of war in which man now lives&#xD;
is not to last always. The conditions of-antagonism&#xD;
must be changed for those of harmony,and man must&#xD;
do the work. But how can this great work be done?"&#xD;
" Hearken, brother, and I will tell thee," said a&#xD;
strange voice. "The trumpet is lieard, and God has&#xD;
not forsaken Zion. You are happier .than poets,&#xD;
prophets,-and sagest who, haveA' longed ,o see. this&#xD;
day. All hail, beauteous morning:-" and with this&#xD;
the stranger left.&#xD;
Charles was confounded. Whence the visitor had&#xD;
come or whither he had gone, Charles knew not.&#xD;
Whilst meditating, he wassitting at his table with&#xD;
his hand over his forehead and eyes closed. Upon&#xD;
hearing he voice he looked up, saw  the door ajar&#xD;
and the .stranger standing near him. His counte-&#xD;
nance was calm and thoughtful, with a peculiar blend--&#xD;
ing of sadness and hope. Charles realized in anmo-&#xD;
ment that he was in the presence of a superior being,&#xD;
who might as to his body be of earth, but who,s to&#xD;
his spirit, knew much of heaven and its. harmony. 9&#xD;
Those mild eyes beamed with an unearthly lustre,&#xD;
and theyseemed to penetrate.the deepest recesses&#xD;
of the soul., Charles was conscious tha.t thebook of&#xD;
his own mind-was open, and that his inmost thoughts&#xD;
were read therein.&#xD;
The next morning Chadles rose early, and' with&#xD;
the sun came his mysterious visitor.&#xD;
A friendly. greeting, and then the stranger began:&#xD;
" My dear Charles, you would know: how the con-&#xD;
dition of antagonism may bechanged into those of&#xD;
harmony, and earth made glorious. I shall in due&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
THE RELATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL'S FUTURE&#xD;
TO HIS PRESENT.&#xD;
" IN this life, the conduct of each affects him for&#xD;
happiness or misery.' One act is followed by the&#xD;
reward of -happiness, another by the penalty- of&#xD;
suffering.&#xD;
"Let any one obey all the laws of healthy and a&#xD;
happy, cheerful, buoyant enjoyment of physical exist-&#xD;
ence is the consequence. If he infringe these laws,&#xD;
disease, with all its pain and suffering, ig the sure&#xD;
result.&#xD;
"iLet an individual obey or disobey a moral law, and&#xD;
* the reward of happiness or unhappiness follows as&#xD;
the second term of the- sequence. 'The golden&#xD;
rule,' is a great moral law founded in the moral&#xD;
constitution of man. Whoever obeys it, is happy&#xD;
in the esteem and sympathy of the noble and vir-&#xD;
tuous, and in the approval of God's voice within.&#xD;
He is happy so far as his relations of harmony with&#xD;
that one law can make him so. Whoever disobeys,&#xD;
,    cannot enjoy communion of spirit with the great and&#xD;
good, but is tormented with the gnawings of selfish-&#xD;
ness, and unhappy so far as the act of disobedience,&#xD;
can affect him.&#xD;
"The same is true of all the moral laws, and it is&#xD;
but proper, as an incidental remark, to state here,&#xD;
that the obligations of society as it is, are not in all&#xD;
respects, by any means, the obligations of moral law&#xD;
as it exists in the nature of man. Society is false in&#xD;
&#xD;
its constitution, has-a false systemsf agerals, and&#xD;
imposes false obligations upon the individuiab fluRt&#xD;
there is a true morality ntwithstanding,:and iti the&#xD;
object of social reform }o to arrangethe relatinsef&#xD;
man to man that the-obligation aftsociety ,wilbe at-&#xD;
one with the obligations of true morality.~&#xD;
"oThat operation of moral law in consequence of&#xD;
which happiness results from  obediencegn d pain&#xD;
from disobedience, is not the ,only onewith which-&#xD;
man's experience _has to do. Habitual obedience not&#xD;
of ly brings the habitual reward-of happiness, but&#xD;
it rendersobedience natural and easy-idisposes and&#xD;
fits the mind to obey ; while, habitual disobediende,&#xD;
not only brings habitual penalty, but renders ather&#xD;
moral sensibilities obtuse whets the evil propensitiesy&#xD;
and gives the soul more of the desire and power&#xD;
to sin.&#xD;
"The first act of cruelty may shock benevolencb e&#xD;
.    the first act of dishonesty may give a pang to ony&#xD;
scientiousness,; the first act of blasphemy may cause&#xD;
the religious.instinct to'evolt, but the habitual&#xD;
practice of cruelty,-fraud, and irreverence willren&#xD;
der the moral sensibilities-;callous, give aoti.ity&#xD;
and force to the sinful propensities ,and make them&#xD;
more arrogant and intrusive. -The first .act ..of res&#xD;
ligion, integrity or kindness, made to proceed frmt&#xD;
an inward prompting, may require an =effortbit if&#xD;
frequently repeated, it arouses into active energy the&#xD;
moral faculty from which it proceedsands deadens&#xD;
by resistance and. disuse whetever is an tagonistie.&#xD;
"Thus a good act, so far=as its'legitimate sphereref&#xD;
influence- extends, affects the, mind for good whilst&#xD;
subject to .the existing mental law . Itsis true that&#xD;
subsequent to- the good act, the repetition -may be&#xD;
neglected and bad ones supply its place;,till th mind&#xD;
is more degraded-than before the; worthy deed was.&#xD;
done. But it is also true that the soul wouldhveh&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC7393-00000045"/>&#xD;
A14D AS IT SHOULD BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
been still more vitiMed without the redeeming virtue&#xD;
of the good act.&#xD;
"Just so with 'evil works;' theyleave effects upon&#xD;
the soul as lasting as the existing laws of mind. It&#xD;
is true that the bad act may not be repeated, and&#xD;
virtuous ones follow till the mind rises far superior&#xD;
to what- it was before the wrong was committed;&#xD;
but it is also true that without the sinful deed, the&#xD;
soul would -have been still more exalted ; and had -an&#xD;
act of virtue been done instead, the spiritual man&#xD;
would have risen to a still greater elevation.&#xD;
"In view of these considerations, I conclude that&#xD;
every act in this life leaves its impress upon the mind&#xD;
either for good or evil. The law of mind by which&#xD;
this takes place, I will call the Law.of Moral Dis-&#xD;
cipline.&#xD;
" Admitting this conclusion, then: first, if man be&#xD;
immortal; -secondly, if divine law be immutable ;&#xD;
thirdly, if the divine government be consistent with&#xD;
itself; fourthly, if the law- of moral discipline be a&#xD;
law of mind distinct from matter,--then does. it fol-&#xD;
low that:the consequences to the individual of his con-&#xD;
duct in this life are eternal.&#xD;
" 1. As to immortality, I need say but little.. Man&#xD;
longs for endless being, and if he -is not mocked, he&#xD;
will live forever.&#xD;
" Throughout the government of God, so far as&#xD;
we are acquainted, there is universal adaptation.&#xD;
There is no mechanism without a purpose, no appe-&#xD;
tite without the corresponding food, no desire with-&#xD;
out the appropriate means of gratification. The&#xD;
complicated mechanism of the eye has seeing for its&#xD;
object.; the appetite of hunger is gratified with food;&#xD;
the desire of distinction has the wide world to revel&#xD;
in. Since this ;adaption is universal--not one ex-&#xD;
ception to be found thereto in all the realms within&#xD;
the range of man's observation--shall we regard the&#xD;
&#xD;
desire of immortality an anomaly? a condition with{&#xD;
out its counterpart? a longing without the possi&#xD;
bility of its ever being satisfied,?"&#xD;
"Permit me to interrupt you," said Charles; "I&#xD;
am a firm believer in immortality, indeed:- know that&#xD;
I shall live after this-body has crumbled to dust, but&#xD;
I would respectfully ask whether there are not:hu-&#xD;
man desires which man is without the means of grat-&#xD;
fying. . . He desires to know the origin -ofhimseWand&#xD;
all things,-the nature of his future existence and&#xD;
final destiny, and yet it seems that he cannot. JIt&#xD;
this mockery1"&#xD;
" You are right," said the. stranger;"man has&#xD;
these desires, but who can say that they will not be&#xD;
gratified?  None but he who has lived out thecyjcles&#xD;
of eternity and completed his destiny's&#xD;
"fI perceive the conclusiveness of your answer,"&#xD;
said Charles quickly. ." These desires pertaina to-that&#xD;
of immortality,;- they all cluster around man's Velig-&#xD;
ious aspiration, and attest the divinity of his origin,&#xD;
the eternity of his destiny."&#xD;
"That is just what I intended to say," replied the&#xD;
other, "and since you accept the doctrine, to=urge it&#xD;
further would be superfluous.&#xD;
"2. It is rather, late in the world t&amp;amp;o mothe&#xD;
question of the immortality of divine law. iniver&#xD;
sal experience confirms the doctrine. The samre&#xD;
physical, organic, moral, and spiritual sequences&#xD;
which obtained two thousand years ago, still recur&#xD;
in the same regular order. Uponthe-unchange,&#xD;
ableness ofdivine - law as manifesfed in the govern-&#xD;
ment of the-universe, isfounded the divine attribute&#xD;
of immutability and this none deny in theory, whi-&#xD;
ever they may do- in  practice. . nIn 'the Father of&#xD;
lights': there . is no variableness, neither shadow of&#xD;

sense, universal. " Man, it is true, has not penetrated&#xD;
the profoundest depths, nor explored the utmost&#xD;
bounds of creation, but still he has been able to pen&#xD;
an extent of the universe absolutely very great,&#xD;
whatever it may be relatively, and a&amp;amp;s found therein&#xD;
the same uniformity of plan, the same unity of design.&#xD;
" The whole universe must be in harmony; other-&#xD;
w    there would be conflict between the different&#xD;
parts, disorder, confusion, eternal clashing,-elemental&#xD;
war. Whenever, then, the same circumstances ex-&#xD;
ist, there do we find the same means. used to pro-&#xD;
duce the same effect. When the conditions are&#xD;
different, corresponding means are adapted to the&#xD;
design ; but even here we see the divine purposes&#xD;
marked by the same great moral principles which&#xD;
everywhere characterize the operating energies of&#xD;
the Eternal. The universe has but one God, and&#xD;
his government is unity.&#xD;
"We are authorized to conclude that the divine&#xD;
government, in all its various departments, is uni-&#xD;
form and consistent-that there is a perfect analogy&#xD;
between the modes of that government in whatever&#xD;
different spheres it may be administered. Unless&#xD;
this uniformity characterizes the divine operations&#xD;
everywhere, God himself as Legislator and Executor&#xD;
would be a capricious, vascillating, inconsistent be-&#xD;
ing, and no reliance could be placed by his intelli-&#xD;
gent creature, upon the order of his government. -All&#xD;
would be irregular and uncertain. But that such is&#xD;
not the case, every day's experience -amidst the&#xD;
phenomena of nature affords every assurance. That&#xD;
God's government is uniform, that a perfect analogy&#xD;
exists between all the modes and spheres of its ad,&#xD;
ministration, is confirmed by all within the'range of&#xD;
man's observatio.- It-is necessary to harmony, that&#xD;
the divine government be consistent with itself.&#xD;
Now since the soul is immortal, law inrimutable,&#xD;
&#xD;
and the divine government consistent w ih ftsW, we&#xD;
should expect siigh a connection betweenth life 'and&#xD;
that which is to come, that-the characte { the indi&#xD;
vidual forms for himself here willbe thatwitlh -which&#xD;
he enters Upon the next sphere -of existence. -Now&#xD;
if the law of moral discipline -be alaw of mind dis:&#xD;
tinct from -matter, thenindeed is{it incontrovertible&#xD;
that the next life is but a continuation of thisesthe&#xD;
life of one year is the continuation Of the life pf an!&#xD;
other.  Since the conditions of my mind-,to-day&#xD;
have a dependence on my -conduet yesterday, in&#xD;
like manner does my happiness this year, the'next,&#xD;
and during my earthly existence,. depend in part&#xD;
upon my conduct, last year; and so, if the, laws of&#xD;
moral discipline be a law of mind distinct from matter,&#xD;
the happiness of my  eternal future: is affected in part&#xD;
by my conduct in the present life. But-"if it be a&#xD;
law of matter, then the acts of this life cannot afeet&#xD;
the happiness of the, next, for the -soul's material&#xD;
vechicle is left with its mother earth. If it be a&#xD;
law of mind -in combination with matter only, hue&#xD;
man acts- for the same reason cannot affect the soil&#xD;
hereafter.&#xD;
"4. But the law of moral discipline cannot'be a&#xD;
law of matter. When' not used as the instraient&#xD;
of mind, matter is not subject in .any wise ton sneh&#xD;
a mode of government, and the law in qu  tion can'&#xD;
not be a 'physical law.&#xD;
"Is it, therefore, a law 'of mind and matterrin a&#xD;
state of organic connection only?  Iffso, why should&#xD;
Deity make it a- law of both and not of -mind When&#xD;
disconnected from matter? -The body'remains withf&#xD;

'OCITY . AS IT IS&#xD;
law of moral discipline, where are we to look in&#xD;
this particular for uniformity in the divine govern-&#xD;
ment exhibited any where else?  To subject mind to&#xD;
one mode of government in connection with matter,&#xD;
and then, when the clayey tenement is thrown off,&#xD;
annihilate all the effects and consequences of the&#xD;
natural and legitimate operation of that law upon&#xD;
the mind, would betray an inconsistency, an abrupt&#xD;
incongruity, an absolute want of adaptation no where&#xD;
characteristic of nature within the bounds of human&#xD;
observation and experience. What God has made a&#xD;
law of mind in connection with matter, he has also&#xD;
made a law of mind when divorced from matter.&#xD;
For if he has made the law in question a law of mind&#xD;
when in connection with the body, and made it not&#xD;
a law of mind when separated from the body, then&#xD;
is his moral government in this world and in the next&#xD;
unlike. But God, whether we consider him a per.&#xD;
sonal being or the animating principle of the uni-&#xD;
verse, is without 'shadow of turning,' his govern-&#xD;
ment, uniform and consistent with itself, and there-&#xD;
fore, the laws to which he has subjected mind are&#xD;
the same here and hereafter."&#xD;
" I would not be captious," interposed Charles,&#xD;
" but I am not persuaded that your reasoning is con-&#xD;
clusive. The mind is connected here with a coarse&#xD;
organism,'and hereafter not, and hence the circum-&#xD;
stances would be different under which the law would&#xD;
operate; and might not the next life, from a necessity,&#xD;
be so different from this, that our conduct here would&#xD;
not affect us there, and yet the divine government&#xD;
be consistent. We see here that a blow on the&#xD;
skull, and .disease, of the nerves especially, affect the&#xD;
mind.  My conduct with refepMd* to my body&#xD;
affct:the condition of my miid, and. influences my&#xD;
happiness; and this cannot obtain in the next sphere&#xD;
of existence into which the body is not taken. The&#xD;
&#xD;
AND, AS IT sHOUlD B!.&#xD;
&#xD;
two spheres are different, and it would seem thattheir&#xD;
laws might be."&#xD;
"Your objection, Charles, is well timed, and Liam&#xD;
glad you have made it,'' said his friend, "it.is:true,&#xD;
that the state of the brain-when affected: by accident&#xD;
oriother external agency, mayrchange the afs-&#xD;
tations of mind, but not the mindain its inherent ln-&#xD;
ture. Disease, by affecting the brain, may cange&#xD;
the whole character of mental manifestation, but not&#xD;
the mind, except by the-law of habit. Aeiden t to&#xD;
th6 brain may render some particular faculty dor-&#xD;
mant for life, but do we conclude that the faculty is&#xD;
destroyed because it no longer manifests itself&#xD;
When the spirit is wholly separated from the organ-&#xD;
ism, this faculty will manifest itself in-the next here&#xD;
with no other injury than that which=results from&#xD;
want of exercise in this. 4 Such a result is indicated,&#xD;
if not proved, by the fact, that when byTacc{4 ntpor&#xD;
otherwise, the skull ismade to press upon. the, brain&#xD;
all consciousness ceases; but when the pressure is&#xD;
removed, if the brain is not injured, conciousnes&#xD;
returns, and the mind begins thinking where, it left&#xD;
off when the accident took place.&#xD;
"The phenomenon to which you alluderso far from&#xD;
proving that the law of moral discipline pertains only&#xD;
to mind in combination with} matter, proves  ther&#xD;
that it is a law of mind distinct from matter. This&#xD;
will appear more fully from the following consider-&#xD;
ations.&#xD;
" We take it for granted, that the spirit will live&#xD;
after it has left the body.  W',consider it a  inde-&#xD;
pendent existence. Now, let us regard ;th  material&#xD;
organism as. the instruentality which  dapts this&#xD;
living entity to the material:world. TheAsphrit is&#xD;

SOCIETY AS IT IS-&#xD;
&#xD;
Itself-to live according to its own laws. But if the&#xD;
instrument becomes deranged, the artisan, which is&#xD;
the mind, can work to but little purpose. If the&#xD;
good father's nerves are becoming diseased, he may&#xD;
pray three times a day, and yet daily -become more&#xD;
and more irritable, and less and less religious. -'he&#xD;
disturbing influence of the body, acting upon the&#xD;
soul, or rather clogging it, contravenes the law of&#xD;
moral discipline.  The body is diseased, the mind&#xD;
cannot be itself, and the law does not apply. -When&#xD;
the body recovers perfect health, it answers the our-&#xD;
pose of its existence, the mind acts freely, is itself,&#xD;
and then the -law of moral discipline obtains.&#xD;
" These considerations are to my mind conclusive,&#xD;
that the law' of moral discipline is properly a law of&#xD;
mind. In this sphere it is only so when the body is&#xD;
in health and the proper instrument of mind or spirit;&#xD;
but hereafter, when the spirit is free from grossly&#xD;
knaterial shackles, there will be no obstructions, and&#xD;
the law will act uninterruptedly as one which per-&#xD;
-talus exclusively to mind.&#xD;
"This law, like all others, is immutable, and aqs&#xD;
with a uniformity which the change of spheres can-&#xD;
not disturb; therefore, the doings of. man in this&#xD;
sphere will affect him for happiness or unhappiness,&#xD;
in the next as well as in this. Wrong-doing lumbers&#xD;
the spirit and keeps it down, or sinks it lower ; right-&#xD;
doing unclogs the spirit and leaves it free to rise."&#xD;
"Y lou speak," said Charles, "of wrong-doing and&#xD;
bad acts, of well-doing and good acts ;-how may&#xD;
we know when an action is bad or good, and what&#xD;
has the motive to do with it?"&#xD;
" The motive," replied the other, Rdetermines the&#xD;
character of the action, is the soil of the action, is&#xD;
essentially'the action itself.&#xD;
"Henry lames' would define an esthetic action to&#xD;
be one which makes its end.'or object fll within the&#xD;

"&#xD;

AND AS rr  urt7  BE.&#xD;
subject or actor; an action which rings froman &#xD;
internal pronipting, and is-done because it pleases&#xD;
the subject so to do without egard 'to.extenlcon-&#xD;
siderations. Such an action;would he ahtre Qut-&#xD;
growth of the subject's inmost nature, and since he&#xD;
is essentially God, it  Would be tito1 the subLt&#xD;
true to his'fellow-man, true to his destiny'&#xD;
"I would define 'a-good nationn to be one which is&#xD;
in harmony with the moral or spirittial 'principles&#xD;
which pervade the universe, as power, wisdom, jus-&#xD;
tice, goodness. Such action is true to man's destiny,&#xD;
and is esthetic while it is more. A good act, or one&#xD;
which is true to the real destiny of man, embraces&#xD;
more than the beautiful."&#xD;
"One more observation," said Charles; "there is&#xD;
one particular in which, as it seems to me, the phrase-&#xD;
ology doeset-accurately express the thought; and&#xD;
might lend to error. Is there not an error in saying&#xD;
that every act leaves upon the soul an effect which is&#xD;
eternal, when by following such acts with those of a&#xD;
different character, its effects are removed?"&#xD;
"Let me explain," replied the unkn own. "The&#xD;
effects of violation cleave to.the mind and no MoC&#xD;
repentance or forgiveness can wipe them ou.  but&#xD;
I may, notwithstanding, transgress a. certain- law&#xD;
every day this week, and yet at the epd of the month,&#xD;
have a more exalted mind than I have to-day; The&#xD;
good effects of more obedience may overcome the&#xD;
evil effects of less transgression.&#xD;
"But here is the great consideration: If I had&#xD;
obeyed in all and transgressed none, I would have&#xD;
been still more exalted. That week's'transgresssion&#xD;
has thrown me back a week for all eternity ; hence'1&#xD;
its effects are eternal.&#xD;

pronounces an arbitrary decree of damnation upon&#xD;
man for the error of his ways. Such a god and such&#xD;
a damnation, were conceived in darkness, and exist&#xD;
nowhere in the universe.&#xD;
" On the other hand, the, popular theologies give&#xD;
distorted views of the divine character. They put&#xD;
God in the light of a being actuated like man, by fun-&#xD;
ois wrath and inexorable vengeance. They put laws&#xD;
in the divine code which require the constant personal&#xD;
interference of their Author to carry them inter exe-&#xD;
cution. They represent God as - taking offence at&#xD;
certain acts of wickedness in man, and declaring the&#xD;
divine vengeance against him ;-a vengeance which&#xD;
cannot be averted except by the fulfilment of speci-&#xD;
fied conditions on the part of the offender. Those&#xD;
conditions complied with, God pardons the sin, wipes.&#xD;
it out, remembers it no more.&#xD;
"The pardon is not granted on the grounds of&#xD;
merit in the compliance, but by virtue of a vicarious&#xD;
sacrifice, made by a furious mob eighteen hundred&#xD;
years ago, by which innocent blood was shed, and&#xD;
an angry God appeased ! Think of the divine jus-&#xD;
tice being satisfied by the vicarious offering of inno-&#xD;
cent blood! My God ! what is it huma ignorancee&#xD;
will not conceive and sanction !&#xD;
"The popular theologies, moreover, virtually re-&#xD;
gard God as considering sin an evil in no other light&#xD;
than in that it gives offence to his. kingly majesty,&#xD;
and through this channel affects man. In this re-&#xD;
speet the creeds deify the pride of earthly sovereigns;&#xD;
erect a terrible god out of human passions, and bid&#xD;
their votaries. fall down before it.&#xD;
" They represent the divine mercy as setting aside&#xD;
the divine justice. The latter requires certain penal-&#xD;
ties as the, means of satisfaction, but the former steps&#xD;
in and averts the 'deserved wrath.'&#xD;
"Such is the contradictory and distorted character&#xD;
&#xD;
ascribed by the isms of 'our time; to the God:of the&#xD;
universe! What enlightened- soul does not-ache-in&#xD;
view-of such high-handed and presumptuous deroga-&#xD;
tion from the dignity and consistency of the:4ivine&#xD;
character? What a contrast 'between such an in-&#xD;
congruous medley of absurdities named divine, nd&#xD;
the consistent uprightness, and uniformrnanifestatin&#xD;
of the divine attributes asrshown by the doctrine of&#xD;
moral discipline!&#xD;
" But the contrast we are contemplating is not&#xD;
more striking in' the different lights in which the doc-&#xD;
trines in 'question place the character of God, than in&#xD;
the effect which each is calculated to have on human&#xD;
conduct. .The law of moraldiscipline summons man;&#xD;
and thus enforces the divine decree:&#xD;
"'Obey the laws which exist for the government of&#xD;
God's universal realms and you shall be happy;disobey,&#xD;
and you shall be unhappy. If you obey; no power&#xD;
can rob you of. the blessing; if you disobey, no power&#xD;
can prevent.the execution of the penalty. If you-do&#xD;

declares that future existence is an arbitrary gift, and&#xD;
that all enter it upon equal terms. So far as the future&#xD;
is concerned, the doctrine affords no incentive to&#xD;
present -well-doing. It breaks all connection between&#xD;
the habits of this sphere and the spiritual conditions&#xD;
of the next.&#xD;
"The doctrine of moral discipline, unlike .those&#xD;
which we have had under review, gives, no encour-&#xD;
agement to the indulgence of criminal desire and the&#xD;
procrastination of reform. The time given to sin is&#xD;
lost forever. No momentary effort of the soul, no&#xD;
vicarious sacrifice, no imputed righteousness, no&#xD;
means whatever, can redeem the loss of a single&#xD;
sinful act.&#xD;
" The law declares that everything is lost by wrong-&#xD;
doing--everything gained by well-doing. And, so&#xD;
far as the faith has an influence, its restraints are all&#xD;
upon wrong, and its incentives all for the right,&#xD;
" But, besides the considerations of logic, to show&#xD;
the superiority of the doctrine contended for, we have&#xD;
experience to rely upon. The knowledge of this law&#xD;
inspires-a concern for spiritual disciplinee unknown to&#xD;
the popular notions. Its full appreciation has set&#xD;
many a one to the work of his own spiritual training,&#xD;
who manifested only unconcern and apathy under&#xD;
the old views.&#xD;
"*But, although I thus insist on the moral tendency&#xD;
of a knowledge of this moral law, yet it would be&#xD;
vain to expect it to mould perfect characters, under&#xD;
existing circumstances, for those who receive it. We&#xD;
might be able, by the inspiration of this law, to do&#xD;
all we know to be right, and yet fail in much, for&#xD;
want of a full and correct knowledge of the princi-"&#xD;
pies of genuine 'morality or spiritual culture.&#xD;
" But this is not, by any means, the greatest reason&#xD;
why the mere knowledge of this law can not unclog&#xD;
the soul. A greater-the greatest, indeed, : to be&#xD;

&#xD;
found in this mal-organization of society. Man is&#xD;
placed in unnatural relations to man, and, in conse-&#xD;
quence, subject to all manner of temptation to wrong.&#xD;
But temptation is'not all. Wrong-doing is often a&#xD;
necessity. Private interest clashes with public inter-&#xD;
est; the individual is at war with the mass, and&#xD;
whilst such vicious, and even, criminal conditions ob-&#xD;
tain, the magic of no faith, not even faith in the law&#xD;
of moral discipline, can unshackle the soul. The con-&#xD;
ditions of society must be changed and made harmo-&#xD;
nious; the principles of true morality must be known,&#xD;
and then will the moral effects of the law in question&#xD;
be entirely superseded. Man is inherently good, and&#xD;
when disinthralled will do right, and ascend by spon-&#xD;
taneous impulse.&#xD;
" But, in bringing about those conditions, the law&#xD;
has its part to accomplish. It teaches us by the sure&#xD;
methods of experience, in what way ill-doing and&#xD;
well-doing affect us, and thereby creates an ardent&#xD;
desire, an intense longing in the mind of true religious&#xD;
aspiration, to bring about such social conditions as&#xD;
will relieve the spirit from its -present thraldom.&#xD;
Thus, the influence of the law for good, is not only&#xD;
direct but indirect. Under the existing falses of&#xD;
society, it has an immediate influence upon character,&#xD;
and a mediate influence upon the social conditions,&#xD;
or, should have; and when it shall have accomplished&#xD;
all it tends to in this direction, its operation will be&#xD;
attended with happiness only. The conditions it&#xD;
demands will obtain, and man will rise by a necessity&#xD;
of his nature."&#xD;
"This," said Charles, "attaches much importance&#xD;
to the law of moral discipline, and your view seems&#xD;
reasonable. I plead for the Church but.a moment&#xD;
ago, yet I must say that the indirect tendencies of&#xD;
the law upon society, through its direct influence&#xD;
upon the Individual, contributes still further to deepen&#xD;

the contrast between it and the 'dogmas"or at least&#xD;
the doings of the Church,"&#xD;
"You are quite right," replied the unknown&#xD;
"The Church as an organization, cares but little&#xD;
about any better conditions of society,  t has no&#xD;
faith in them. It is far more concerned about the&#xD;
distant heathen, while it not only connives at,.but&#xD;
- even fosters those social influences which nmake&#xD;
heathen enough at home; and that too within its&#xD;
own precincts,-if not heathen, at least idolators;-&#xD;
for Juggernaut has not more devoted worshipers than&#xD;
have Mammon and Fashion. The eastern god is&#xD;
honored with human sacrifices ; and ours too.&#xD;
"It is notorious that the Church opposes all attempts&#xD;
to reorganize society, and is bitter in its opposition.&#xD;
To moot the question of social reform is to give con-&#xD;
clusive proof that we are 'infidels.' The great body&#xD;
of the clergy are satisfied with things as they are. They&#xD;
keep frt enough; and then-it questions their wisdom&#xD;
and wounds their pride to presume that they are not&#xD;
altogether competent to incur all the responsibilities&#xD;
and discharge all the duties connected with human&#xD;
happiness here and hereafter. They tell us, that&#xD;
theirs is the panacea that will heal the sin-sick soul,.&#xD;
and transmute misery into happiness. It matters not&#xD;
what my condition is ; I may be crushed to earth;&#xD;
they have only to ,bid me rise, and I can obey. I&#xD;
may be compelled to toil at an occupationw. holly&#xD;
unsuited to my capacities and tastes; and not allowed&#xD;
to cease till the very soul js worn out of me, and yet&#xD;
they will exhort me for an hour at a time, and never&#xD;
utter a word of remonstrance against the wretched-&#xD;
ness of my social fate, nor lift a hand to relieve me&#xD;
They will sing about taking my feet from the mire&#xD;
and the clay, but when they've got done singing, I&#xD;
am no better off than before. I can torture, by:ano&#xD;
imagination. of mine, the slough with which 'I am&#xD;
overwhelmed, into the ' rock of ages.'&#xD;

SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
" The Church claims that within itself are the&#xD;
appointed means whereby God confers happiness here&#xD;
and salvaticn hereafter; and so why be troubled&#xD;
about the conditions of society. It is as easy to save&#xD;
a man, or woman, or negro, in one condition as&#xD;
another, if he, or she, or it, is willing; and as to the&#xD;
willing, that is a matter which pertains to the indi-&#xD;
vidual, and if he does not will, it is his own fault.&#xD;
" This brings us to another point : The influence&#xD;
of circumstances over the will and conduct of the&#xD;
individual. This will be our theme for the next&#xD;
interview."&#xD;
" I see no logical objection," said Charles, "to the&#xD;
views you have so frankly presented, and I accept&#xD;
them with all my heart; but surely Christendom is&#xD;
not yet prepared for such teachings. Many, even o&#xD;
liberal tendencies, would fear that the promulgation&#xD;
of such views would lead to irreligion, and do more&#xD;
harm than good."&#xD;
" Their apprehensions would be groundless," said&#xD;
Charles' mentor. "Those already 'religious' and&#xD;
unprepared for our positive views, would reject our&#xD;
criticisms utterly, and us too. Of those not profes-&#xD;
sionally religious, some may, perchance, see the better&#xD;
way at our pointing, and joyfully enter therein.&#xD;
"And then we must ferret out corruption and show&#xD;
where it is, before effective measures will be taken to&#xD;
cast it out. - Jesus did not spare the hypocrisy of the&#xD;
Pharisees, nor Luther the abuses of Rome. Major&#xD;
Ludlow could not put down the suttee or widow&#xD;
burning in India, by showing the beauty of the right&#xD;
way, and only succeeded by attacking the institution&#xD;
directly and showing its want of legal validity. It is&#xD;
our right and duty to contrast consistency and incon-&#xD;
sistency, order and disorder, truth and error, and in&#xD;
so doing bring out the beauty of the one and deformity&#xD;
of the other. Success in behalf of truth demands&#xD;

"THE circumstances of the individual may be divid-&#xD;

temples-vocal with the music of winged worship-&#xD;
ers, the contemplator caught the spirit of Nature&#xD;
and a flood of happiness overwhelmed his mind.&#xD;
But if these soul-stirring circumstances were reversed,&#xD;
changed from glory to gloom, the mind would expe-&#xD;
rience a corresponding change. Such would be the&#xD;
tendency of circumstances.&#xD;
" The transmission of mental qualities from parent&#xD;
to child, is not a capricious or arbitrary result. . By&#xD;
the law of hereditary descent, different characters&#xD;
are inherited by the offspring of the same parents, in&#xD;
consequence of the different phases of character&#xD;
&#xD;
Il&#xD;
&#xD;
which the latter experience at different times., The&#xD;
character of the child at birth, is, therefore, deter-&#xD;
mined by circumstances over which it has no con-&#xD;
trol, acting in accordance with general law. So far,&#xD;
it is the creature of circumstances.&#xD;
"2. During the first year of his existence, the individ-&#xD;
ual has not the power, if he iad the will, to create the&#xD;
circumstances by which he shall be affected. The in-&#xD;
fant's nurse modifies and creates those circumstances.&#xD;
If she provide it suitable food, make it comfortable, and&#xD;
exhibit in its presence an exemplary disposition, her&#xD;
charge will be affected for good. The contrary cir-&#xD;
cumstances would affect it for evil.&#xD;
"That these things influence the child no one doubts.&#xD;
Whether the nurse be good-humored or morose, the&#xD;
tendency is to inspire acorresponding disposition.&#xD;
When she laughs, the child laughs: when she looks&#xD;
sullen, and speaks with tones of voice to match, the&#xD;
child's countenance and voice are in a great measure&#xD;
but the reflection of hers. She affects it by her own&#xD;
magnetism through its impressibility. Its character,&#xD;
therefore, and its doings so far, are all the result of&#xD;
circumstances acting by general law;-circumstances&#xD;
over which the mind, affected thereby, has. not the&#xD;
least control. They first determined the mould of the&#xD;
mind, and thus far they have developed it.&#xD;
"13. The.conscious. The child progresses, and at&#xD;
length arrives at-that period of life when the powers&#xD;
of observation and reason are sufficiently developed&#xD;
to distinguish right from wrong, good from evil, as&#xD;
existent in the prevailing ethics. ,The mind can now&#xD;
will with a degree of intelligence, and it may be said&#xD;
that-it is no longer the creature of circumstances.&#xD;
This, however, is not true; unless, first, the .will is&#xD;
an independent:power, and, secgndly,. can always&#xD;
be executed.. fBut, these propositions are false, as I&#xD;
shall proceed to show.&#xD;

" Upon no subject does there- seem to be such a&#xD;
general befogment as upon this of the will. The&#xD;
truth is, that the will is free, and not free; and this&#xD;
is the paradox that puzzles so many. No one of&#xD;
sane mind but feels his will free. He never acts but&#xD;
according' to his will, and wills what he pleases.&#xD;
The will, therefore, is an independent, self-determin-&#xD;
ing faculty. Such superficiality becomes self-evident&#xD;
truth to the most of persons.&#xD;
" A certain stickler for such notions paid me a&#xD;
visit once upon a time. He had rode forty miles&#xD;
without anything to eat, and was very hungry. I&#xD;
set him a basket of fruit, and remarked that as his&#xD;
will was free, he could eat or not as he pleased, but&#xD;
that supper would soon be'ready. 'I will to eat,'&#xD;
said he, and suiting the action to the word, went to&#xD;
work and did great execution. So much fruit did&#xD;
not do well after so long a fast, and he had a hard&#xD;
night of it.&#xD;
"The next time he came, I proffered the same, but&#xD;
he replied: 'I should prefer to eat no fruit till after&#xD;
supper.'&#xD;
"6You will differently," said I, "to what you did on&#xD;
the occasion of your last visit."&#xD;
"'O yes,' said he, 'my will is free-I will as I&#xD;
please.'&#xD;
"But why did you will to eat fruit before?"&#xD;
"i was hungry, and not being aware of the effect&#xD;
of so much fruit on a rather weak stomach, after&#xD;
so long a fast, I willed to eat.'&#xD;
" But why not will to eat now? you are as hungry&#xD;
as then"&#xD;
"'I remember my experince,' responded he, a little&#xD;
irritated.&#xD;
"Then," said I, as blandly as possible, "hunger,&#xD;
with ignorance, determined your will in the first in-&#xD;
stance;-in the second it is determined by enlight-&#xD;
&#xD;
ened intellect., The state of your faculties in both&#xD;
cases determined your will. Their state 'in the one&#xD;
case was excited  alimentiveness and uninformed&#xD;
reason ; in the other, it is enlightened judgment."&#xD;
"I emphasized the last two words, and as my&#xD;
friend seemed to be somewhat flattered, I ventured&#xD;
to proceed:&#xD;
"6By mental faculties, I mean, of course, the appe-&#xD;
tites, passions, propensities, sentiments, &amp;amp;c., as well&#xD;
s the intellectual powers. Though some of these&#xD;
are manifested more particularly in the body,yet they&#xD;
ex,.t in the mind, anA-I shall speak of them as mental&#xD;
faculties.&#xD;
"My friend saw that I was preparing for a siege,&#xD;
and became a little nervous. lie hitched round on&#xD;
his chair, and looked toward the pantry in a manner&#xD;
altogether unanswerable, except by something more&#xD;
substantial than logic. - He was in no mood to hear&#xD;
explanations, and preferred to be helped to a slice of&#xD;
beefsteak, rather than to conviction of error;- and so&#xD;
I abstained for the present.&#xD;
"After alimentivness-was gratified, combativeness&#xD;
and destructiveness became less excitable, and he&#xD;
seemed disposed to chat a little. He 'contended that&#xD;
the inebriate could abstain from intoxicating drinks&#xD;
whenever he pleased.&#xD;
"Yes," said I, "while he wills to abstain, he can."&#xD;
"'And he can will thus,' was the response, 'when-&#xD;
ever he wants to.'&#xD;
"Very good," I answered, "but sometimes he&#xD;
don't want to: why is -it that he wants to sometimes&#xD;
and at other times not?"&#xD;
""Because he don't will it so,' said he:&#xD;
"That is," I went on to say, "he don't abstain be-&#xD;
cause he don't will to; and- the reason-he dan't will&#xD;
to abstain, is because he don't will to will to abstain;&#xD;
and the reason he don't will to will to abstains is be-&#xD;
cause he don't will to will to will to abstain!&#xD;

"My friend began to look wild. I continned:&#xD;
" A naughty boy in school pinched those next him.&#xD;
The teacher found it out and asked him what he.did&#xD;
it for. 'Because,' was the reason rendered. 'But,'&#xD;
said the teacher,'the reason: 1 want to know the&#xD;
reason why you did so?' 'Because,' he replied as&#xD;
promptly as before. That boy, continued I, if he&#xD;
keeps on will make a first rate free-will philosopher.&#xD;
"My guest was evidently nettled, but the diges-&#xD;
tive functions had got fairly under way, and he had&#xD;
too copious a supply of good humor to get much out&#xD;
of sorts.&#xD;
" When a reason is asked for, said I, a reason&#xD;
should be rendered. The reason why the vacillat-&#xD;
ing inebriate wills to-day one way, and to-morrow&#xD;
another, is that the faculties of his mind are in differ-&#xD;
ent states. To-day" alimentiveness is predominant,&#xD;
and determines the will in favor of drinking ; to-mor-&#xD;
row an enlightened conscience is supreme, and it de-&#xD;
termines the will against drinking.&#xD;
"Now what is true of the intemperate, is also&#xD;
true of the despondent, choleric, licentious, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
The mind of the drunkard is a human mind. What&#xD;
is philosophically true in reference to the determin-&#xD;
ing of his will, is true of all other classes of minds.&#xD;
The state of his mental faculties determines his will,&#xD;
and hence the state of the mental faculties of any&#xD;
other individual determinesthat individuaL's will.&#xD;
"By this time my friend had got a cigar lit, and&#xD;
with his chin tilted back, and his foot against the top&#xD;
of the jam, he was puffing away with the greatest&#xD;
nonchalance imaginable.&#xD;
"'Isn't that speech about through with?' he in-&#xD;
quired, looking gravely. 'Hasn't will something&#xD;
to do in determining the state of the faculties? It's&#xD;
a poor rule that wont work both ways.'&#xD;
" We shall see, said I. The melancholy xman is&#xD;

informed of the law of moral discipline,.and at once&#xD;
his thoughts take a different direction '. The state of&#xD;
his faculties change from despondence to comparative&#xD;
cheerfulness. Similar changes may occur with men&#xD;
beset with. other failings. In the case supposed,&#xD;
there is a power exerted over the state of the facul-&#xD;
ties and it is changed. Now, is that power the mere&#xD;
force of will?  It may do to say so in common&#xD;
parlance,, but it is not philosophically true. Infor-&#xD;
mation concerning a law of mind acted on'reason and&#xD;
conscience; and thus produced the change in question.&#xD;
The change was wrought, not by will self-determined,&#xD;
but by the circumstance of communicated knowledge&#xD;
acting on the faculties themselves.&#xD;
"This brings us to the consideration of. the in-&#xD;
fluence of circumstances in determining the state of&#xD;
the faculties.&#xD;
"I shall still use the case of the drunkard, and take&#xD;
as circumstances the grog-shop and temperance re-&#xD;
form. When the first tempts, it gives supremacy to&#xD;
'the appetite. When the lecturer persuades,.predom-&#xD;
inance is given to the moral sentiments. In the one&#xD;
case, the state of the faculties is so determined by the&#xD;
circumstance that it leads to the excesses of:drunk-&#xD;
enness ; in the other, the state of the faculties is'so&#xD;
operated on by the circumstance, that it leads to the&#xD;
initiatory stages of reformation. Then, he willedto&#xD;
drink to excess; now, he wills to live a sober. aid&#xD;
worthy life. He wills in both cases as he wants to ;&#xD;
that is, as the state of the. faculties determine. -and&#xD;
the circumstances determine the state of the, facul.&#xD;
ties; therefore do circumstances; control the will,&#xD;
through their influence on the state of the faculties.&#xD;
"But let us try the case further. The inebriate&#xD;
has willed, whilst under the control of the moral and&#xD;
intellectual. faculties, to drink to excess no more.&#xD;
He happens in the vicinity of a grog.shop, and a&#xD;

&#xD;
struggle ensues between two classes of faculties.&#xD;
The higher ones endeavor .to retain the supremacy ;&#xD;
the lower to gain it. The former say to him:&#xD;
'Touch not, it is poison.' The latter say: 'Partake&#xD;
freely, it will do you good.' The faculties are&#xD;
balanced in their influence, and no will at all is the&#xD;
result. He neither advances nor recedes. The mind&#xD;
is undecided.&#xD;
" Along comes an old toper, pats the wavering&#xD;
man on the shoulder, and says with real zest : 'Come,&#xD;
let's have something to drink.' In the twinkling of&#xD;
an eye, the will is fashioned according to the influence&#xD;
of this circumstance, and executed to the -tune of&#xD;
half a dozen glasses. The predetermined will not to'&#xD;
drink, is thus superceded by the will to drink, in&#xD;
consequence of the operation of circumstances on the&#xD;
state of the faculties.&#xD;
" Next week he happens at the same stand-still&#xD;
point, with his back against the door-cheek, and his&#xD;
eye on the well-stored bar,-he hesitates. Along&#xD;
comes a Washingtonian, and taking him by the arm,&#xD;
says kindly: ' Come, let us go and hear Father&#xD;
Matthew to-night.' This circumstance determines.&#xD;
the will according to its legitimate tendency, and the&#xD;
inebriate walks off as much relieved as the victim&#xD;
who has just escaped the charm of a viper. Thus&#xD;
the will is confirmed in consequence of circum-&#xD;
stances which brought the faculties back to that state&#xD;
in which they had previously determined the will.&#xD;
It is clear enough, from these considerations, that'&#xD;
circumstances exercise an influence in determining&#xD;
the state of the faculties.&#xD;
" But there is another consideration, I proceeded&#xD;
to say, which must not be overlooked, and that is&#xD;
the influence of the mental constitution in deter-&#xD;
mining the state of the faculties.&#xD;
" There is a vast difference between. the state of&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS ET SHOULD BE. 17&#xD;
the faculties and the constitution of the mind. -The&#xD;
latter is the relate developientiof the faculties, and&#xD;
changes only by very slow processes. The former&#xD;
is the relative activity of the faculties, and may&#xD;
change a thousand times in a day. No two men have&#xD;
mental constitutions precisely alike. If the consti-&#xD;
tution of the human mind were precisely the same in&#xD;
every .individual, then would all be affected in like&#xD;
manner by the same circumstances. The same cir-&#xD;
cumstances would universally induce the same state&#xD;
of the faculties. But such we know is not the case.&#xD;
"Circumstances which would give a certain state&#xD;
of the faculties to one mind, mav not be strong&#xD;
enough to give the same state to another. The son&#xD;
of inebriate parents inherits a depraved appetite for&#xD;
stimulants, and -a little. temptation will carryshim into&#xD;
all the excesses of debauchery. The son of -strictly&#xD;
temperate parents does not inherit the morbid taste&#xD;
for alcoholic drinks, and it will require circumstances&#xD;
of greater force to make-him a drunkard. ,We may&#xD;
conceive the mind of a third, so organized as to bid&#xD;
defiance to all influence of this nature, and maintain&#xD;
its will to live soberly in spite of all circumstances to&#xD;
the contrary. It is, consequently, clear enough that&#xD;
circumstances affect --differently minds of a different&#xD;
constitution~; therefore, mental constitution has' much&#xD;
to do in the determining of the state of the faculties.&#xD;
"Other examples confirm this conclusion. Circum..&#xD;
stances of adversity act very differently on one wh.&#xD;
is liable to despondency, and on another who is&#xD;
always hopeful. Circumstances of insult affect one&#xD;
with large self-esteem and combativeness'very differ'&#xD;
ently from one with these organs small; and thus to&#xD;
the end of the chapter.&#xD;
"From what has been: said, the following con-&#xD;
clusions maybe deduced&#xD;
"1.' The constitution' of the mind and the circium-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7393-00000060"/>&#xD;
AND AS IT SHOULD -BE.          1-19"&#xD;
&#xD;
stances in which it is placed, determine the state of&#xD;
the faculties.&#xD;
" 2. The state of the faculties determines the will.&#xD;
Therefore,&#xD;
" 3. The will is determined by the mental consti-&#xD;
stitution and the circumstances which affect it.&#xD;
Consequently,&#xD;
" 4. The mind can not will independently of the&#xD;
circumstances which affect it, and the bent given it&#xD;
by its peculiar constitution; To which may be added&#xD;
the two following:&#xD;
"5. The character of the man-his voluntary&#xD;
doings, whether of good or evil-result from the&#xD;
nature of his will. This is a self-evident proposition,&#xD;
and will be gainsayed by no one. Taken in con-&#xD;
nection with the foregoing conclusions, it warrants&#xD;
another step:&#xD;
"6. The character is determined by the mental&#xD;
constitution and the circumstances which determine&#xD;
the will through their influence on the state of the&#xD;
faculties.&#xD;
" By this time, my friend was bowing to me at&#xD;
regular intervals with peculiar grace. I fancied that&#xD;
I was making a deep impression on his mind, and got&#xD;
in great earnest, but afterward discovered that he&#xD;
was only in a comfortable dose, and out of the reach&#xD;
of my logical missiles.&#xD;
" Having shown that will is not an independent&#xD;
power, it remains to show that it can not always be&#xD;
executed.&#xD;
"There are two difficulties in the way of acting&#xD;
out the will: 1. Physical necessity. A man in a&#xD;
dungeon may will to get out, and try its execution,&#xD;
but is prevented by strong walls, massive doors, and&#xD;
iron bolts. 2. Moral necessity. The melancholy&#xD;
man in a moment of cheerfulness may will never to&#xD;
despond again; but an east wind blows, or adversity&#xD;
&#xD;
comes,, and despondency is sure to fcilow, in spite of&#xD;
every effort to the contrary. The irritable manin 'a&#xD;
moment of good nature wills to keep his temper for&#xD;
all time to come. A train of vexatious circumstances&#xD;
affect him, and in spite of predetermined volition, he&#xD;
falls into a passion. The execution of will, in these&#xD;
cases, depends on continuing the same state of facul-&#xD;
ties which obtained when the will was determined.&#xD;
But circumstances change that state, a counter will&#xD;
ensues, and is executed; consequently there arecases&#xD;
in which a particular will can. not be carried into&#xD;
effect for the counter influence of another.&#xD;
"It follows, therefore, from what has now been&#xD;
presented: -1. That will is not an independent, self-&#xD;
determining power.  2. That it cannot always be&#xD;
executed; consequently it is not true that the..mind,&#xD;
after the dawn of conscious reason, is no longer the&#xD;
creature of circumstances. It is affected by circum-&#xD;
stances as well after that period as before.- The differ,&#xD;
ence is, that before the dawn of reason it exercises no&#xD;
control at all over the circumstances which affect it, or&#xD;
else only an unconscious one; whereas, afterward,&#xD;
it exercise a conscious control.&#xD;
It might seem,'. interposed Charles, 'that the&#xD;
proposition you have assumed as self-evident, is hardly&#xD;
consistent, with the conclusion that will can not&#xD;
always be carried into effect.'&#xD;
"'When," said the-other in reply, "the will is pre-&#xD;
vented from being carried into effect by physical&#xD;
necessity, the character is nevertheless in harmony&#xD;
therewith. The will is mentally executed, even if it&#xD;
should not receive expression in the outward act.&#xD;
Whosoever looketh on a ;woman to lust after her,&#xD;
ha.th already committed an- adultery in his heart.'&#xD;
The complexion of the will and of 'the character&#xD;
correspond.&#xD;
-"When, deliberate . or predetermined will is&#xD;
&#xD;
118             SOCIETY AS IT, IS&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7393-00000061"/>&#xD;
thwarted in outward expression, by the intervention&#xD;
of an instantaneous or impulsive will, it is will, never-&#xD;
theless, that is executed, and the character of the&#xD;
individual, as established by his conduct, corresponds&#xD;
to the vacillations of his will."&#xD;
"But," said Charles, " if volition is executed men-&#xD;
tally, whether expressed outwardly or not, why urge&#xD;
its limitation by physical necessity, in support of the&#xD;
general proposition that man is the creature of&#xD;
circumstances?-"&#xD;
" Merely," replied the other, " to show the various&#xD;
ways in which the circumstances affect the creature:&#xD;
first, as we have shown, by acting upon the will; and&#xD;
secondly, as in some cases, by preventing. the reali-&#xD;
zation of the act willed."&#xD;
"One more point," remarked Charles. "You&#xD;
have said that the conscious individual exercises a&#xD;
conscious control over his circumstances; does not&#xD;
this invalidate your doctrine as to man's being the&#xD;
creatureof circumstances? "&#xD;
"Let us discuss this phase of the subject more&#xD;
fully," said Charles' mentor.-&#xD;
"The man who daily getsdrunk amidst the tempta-&#xD;
tions of a tippling-house, may take advantage of a&#xD;
mood of mind in which reason and conscience pre-&#xD;
dominate over alimentiveness, to remove to the&#xD;
country out of the reach of vicious temptation. If&#xD;
he have not nerve enough to remain out of harm's&#xD;
way, the stronger control of a friend or two may&#xD;
support his weaker arm, and by moral combination&#xD;
the circumstances may be controlled .The impatient&#xD;
man, in a mood when enlightened conscience rules,&#xD;
may leave vexatious business and place himself under&#xD;
soothing influences. The licentious man may leave&#xD;
Paris, and breathe the frigid atmosphere of the&#xD;
Rhappists at Economy. The low-spirited man may&#xD;
leave the life of the hermit and seek exhilerating&#xD;

120&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
AND - AS IT SHOULD' BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
12&#xD;
&#xD;
society. The avaricious man may leave Wall steet,&#xD;
retire into 'rural quietude, and commune with the&#xD;
disinterested and intellectual.&#xD;
"This is the only way in which mankind can escape&#xD;
the tyranny of circumstances. Those circumstances&#xD;
amongst which the man moves, exercise a controlling&#xD;
influence over his mind, and, character. -Some- are&#xD;
bad, some good; he 'must seek the friendship of one&#xD;
clas -to thwart the tyranny of the other. If his&#xD;
judgment is enlightened and conscience strengthened,&#xD;
the man 'of easy besetting' sins may take advantage&#xD;
of a favorable state of the faculties to will a change&#xD;
of circumstances, and execute the will. If he isnot&#xD;
strong enough to execute it, he may call in the sup-&#xD;
port of others with more moral energy than himself,&#xD;
and thus he- may flee temptation. The scriptural&#xD;
mode of resisting Satan is to flee from him.- Those&#xD;
devotees of the Bible who think they can will for the&#xD;
best and do what they will, and under this delusion&#xD;
go into vicious associations, too often consummate&#xD;
their own ruin. Instead of running after Satan or&#xD;
daring him, they would consult'their own safety to&#xD;
flee from him when he-pursueth. It would be well&#xD;
to heed what Paul says: ' For the good that I would,&#xD;
I do not: but the evil which Iwould not; that I'do.'&#xD;
If those who really reverence Paul but' understood&#xD;
the import of this' confession, and the truth it "-con-&#xD;
tains, it would do them a deal of -good. They would&#xD;
urge less' the mere force of will, and try unore to&#xD;
give a proper adjustment to the circumstances by&#xD;
which the members of the Church are influenced.&#xD;
Their religion would be a working one; it 'would&#xD;
have substantial reality in it, and lkss of the gossamer&#xD;
They would not tell us that we can do anything we&#xD;
will, and will whatever they tell us :-tWo issever-&#xD;
ations as false as their own Prince of Darkness.&#xD;
"In this connection, we must discriminate between&#xD;

0&#xD;

in&#xD;
&#xD;
SOCIay AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
settled will or purpose, and impulsive will. The first&#xD;
arises from deliberate action of the mind ; the second&#xD;
from a Inore impulsive emotion, passion, appetite, or&#xD;
desire. The latter, as we have shown, often pre-&#xD;
vents the fulfilment of the former.&#xD;
" If my judgment-is enlightened, I may form the&#xD;
general or deliberate will to do the best for my indi-&#xD;
vidual happiness, and the well-being of those around&#xD;
me; and yet, as Paul says, 'the.good that I would,&#xD;
I do not; but the evil which 1 would not, that I do.'&#xD;
"Now, by virtue of this general will, we may&#xD;
endeavor so to change our circumstances as to re-&#xD;
move the occasions of vicious impulse, and bring the&#xD;
emotional will in subordination to that which is delib-&#xD;
erate. It is thus -that we may control our circum-&#xD;
stances. But let it be understood, that in the first&#xD;
place the will to control them has 'to be formed ; and&#xD;
this is done through the influence of moral circum-&#xD;
stances acting upon the mind. As, for example, when&#xD;
the inebriate leaves temptation, he does so because&#xD;
the circumstances of knowledge and   experience&#xD;
determine a state of the faculties which-results in the&#xD;
will' to flee the haunts of drunkenness; and this will,&#xD;
while the faculties are in. a favorable state therefor,&#xD;
is carried into effect. The moral aid of others is but&#xD;
the addition of circumstances with the same tendency.&#xD;
"Inasmuch as circumstances acting on the mind&#xD;
determine the will, by virtue of which we control&#xD;
certain-conditions; such control, therefore, does not&#xD;
disprove the influence. f circumstances over the&#xD;
will, and through ,it o er us.&#xD;
-" In the briefest manner possible, I shall recapitu-&#xD;
late the reasoning presented:.&#xD;
"1. The constitution of the mind is determined&#xD;
before the dawn of consciousness, by circumstances&#xD;
acting in accordance with hereditary and other laws.&#xD;
"2. After this period, circumstances, acting upon&#xD;
&#xD;
193p&#xD;
&#xD;
this constitution of mind, determine the stte:of. the&#xD;
faculties.&#xD;
"3. The state of the faculties determines the will.&#xD;
" 4. The will and character correspond.&#xD;
5. The mind can exercise.a control over circum.&#xD;
stances only in consequence of othertircumstances&#xD;
like those of moral enlightenment, education, xpe-&#xD;
rience, and such as hereditarily affect the constitution&#xD;
of mind.. Therefore,&#xD;
"6. Man is the creature of circumstances."&#xD;
Charles observed, that to designate man as the&#xD;
creature- of-'circumstances, seems to imply that he is&#xD;
nothing.. within hignself;but rather a thing, brought&#xD;
into being by circumstances, and fashioned.thereby,&#xD;
in-all the-essentials as well as 'in all the accidents of&#xD;
character. To which his friend responded:&#xD;
" Man has an individuality, an. inherent capacity,&#xD;
which makes him lord of earth, and is carrying him&#xD;

attach to the phrase."&#xD;
j"I think I understand you," said Charles; "but if&#xD;
man be thus under the control of the conditions with&#xD;
which he is surrounded, wherein is the consistency&#xD;
of praise or blame ?"&#xD;
"Praise and blame," replied his friend, "are neces-&#xD;
sities of our nature under existing circumstances.&#xD;
Like some other features of mental manifestation,&#xD;
they do not stop for the sanctions of philosophical&#xD;
consistency. It would be foolish to get angry at the&#xD;
maniac who strikes us, and yet this is what every&#xD;
irritable man with large combativeness would do.&#xD;
The impulse would be too quick for 'reason, and&#xD;
though a sense of propriety might prevent any out-&#xD;
ward' manifestation of the feeling, it would exist&#xD;
within, nevertheless. The great and good Owen&#xD;
himself, who, upon the merits of this doctrine,' dis-&#xD;
cards all anger, blame, and the like, admits that he&#xD;
might be angry for a moment with those who should&#xD;
wrong him.&#xD;
"If, because he is the creature of circumstances,&#xD;
I am to excuse my neighbor who purposely and&#xD;
maliciously does me mischief, then must I excuse my&#xD;
other neighbor vho blames me for my-errors. The&#xD;
one who throws down my fence to let in his cattle,&#xD;
and the other who blames him for doing so, and me&#xD;
for enduring it so patiently, are both alike 'the&#xD;
creatures of circumstances; and if I excuse wrong&#xD;
doing in the one, I must excuse blame in the other.&#xD;
We must-remove the occasions and causes of anger,&#xD;
ill-will, censure, blame, hatred, revenge &amp;amp;c., it we&#xD;
would cleanse the human heart of these impurities.&#xD;

True philosophy, acting directly upon the individual,&#xD;
may do something, but it is only through. its action&#xD;
upon the conditions of society 'that the regeneration&#xD;
of the human heart is to be consummated.'&#xD;
"Praise, or fraternal approval, springs ..up in the&#xD;
human heart with equal spontaniety, -but it is not&#xD;
desirable that'the occasions thereof should ever past&#xD;
'away, and- they never, will. What is evil: must&#xD;
perish,.but the good will last forever."&#xD;
"Another difficulty,", said Charles. -"If man be&#xD;
the creature of circumstances, what becomes-of his&#xD;
accountability ?"&#xD;
4Now. you have roused the ' bugaboo,"' answered&#xD;
the other. "This is the Martelian club with which&#xD;
all valiant freewillers knock the" infidel' necessity in&#xD;
the head.&#xD;
"6The popular idea of accountability culminates in&#xD;
the popular notion of-the generall judgment.'"In&#xD;
that 'great day,' Christ,-as judge,,is going to institute&#xD;
his court, summon all men before the august tribunals&#xD;
open.the books in which their deeds are duly re.&#xD;
corded, and judge them by the record. From this&#xD;
decision there is no appeal, and the righteousshall&#xD;
go into.everlasting happiness, but the-unrighteous into&#xD;
everlasting misery,-poor 'souls ! how we pity them.!&#xD;
is it not sad that so good a being as the 'God of love"&#xD;
has not as much goodness as we 'depraved' mortals?&#xD;
"This doctrine represents God as exercising a per&#xD;
sonal and special supervision over the-doings of every&#xD;
individual;-a heathen idea, and diametrically' op-&#xD;
posed to that view of the divine government -which&#xD;
supposes it to be carriedon by general and immu-&#xD;
table law. Hence, 'accountability, under' the two&#xD;
modes of government, would be very different.&#xD;

transgresses, he suffers the inevitable penalty. This&#xD;
is the length and breadth of human accountability,&#xD;
and what need of more?   Its tendency is to correc-&#xD;
tion, progress, happiness.      .&#xD;
"Man is accountable-to no laws but those of God,&#xD;
and they execute themselves without judge, jury, or&#xD;
sheriff. So far as the laws of society are in harmony&#xD;
with these, so far has society no right to inflict pun-&#xD;
ishment ;-God's own laws do that for themselves.&#xD;
Whenever society attempts such a thing, it adds&#xD;
pain beyond what is provided for in the divine code&#xD;
of Nature, and thereby sins against God' and man.&#xD;
It is the business of society to reform, not punish;&#xD;
but it should seek, above all things, to remove the&#xD;
causes of transgression.&#xD;
"So far as the laws of society are not at one with&#xD;
the code universal, to inflict punishment for their&#xD;
violation is for society to erect itself into a god, or&#xD;
creative power, and thus by its usurpation become&#xD;
satanic. In such case, it inflicts punishment con-&#xD;
trary to the divine code, throws itself across the path&#xD;
of progress, wrongs the individual, dares God. Of&#xD;
accountability which leads to such results, there had&#xD;
better be none."&#xD;
" Assuredly," responded Charles, "this view of&#xD;
human accountability has beauty, justice, and con-&#xD;
sistency to recommend it. I thank you for the&#xD;
pleasure and profit of this interview. I accept your&#xD;
reasoning and conclusions throughout; but there is&#xD;
one point which I feel, rather than see, that you have&#xD;
hardly insisted on with sufficient emphasis. That is&#xD;
the influence of principle, or rule of conduct received&#xD;
into the mind, in the determining of its volition.&#xD;
"In illustration, we will suppose. two minds. of&#xD;
precisely the same constitution. One has been un-&#xD;
der the teachings of Hosea Ballou, and believes that&#xD;
all men will be alike happy hereafter, whatever their&#xD;

conduct here. The other has been' taught the true&#xD;
science of mind, and understands the -law of moral&#xD;
discipline; Their minds, originally alike, now become&#xD;
very different by virtue of-thle peculiar doctrines&#xD;
each accepts. The latter looks upon life on earth as&#xD;
the rudimental 'school of eternity, and is careful&#xD;
to secure the full measure of its discipline; while the&#xD;
other-sees no connection. between the life which now&#xD;
is and-that which is to come. With the one, life on&#xD;
earth is the boyhood, which, owing to the extent and&#xD;
quality of its culture, determines-the initial character&#xD;
of the man; 'with the other, there is -no necessary&#xD;
relation between the education of the boy and the&#xD;
characteristics of early manhood.. Now the one,&#xD;
armed with the law of moral 4liscipline, goes forth&#xD;
into the world, resolved to do as- judgment and con-&#xD;
science dictate, and amidst the strongest temptations,&#xD;
universally triumphs as the hero of right; while the&#xD;
other, beset in the same way, and without the armor&#xD;
of -correct principles, girds .up his will with no&#xD;
stringent resolve, but abandons it, with a laxity of&#xD;
moral purpose, to the-facinations of sin, and he be-&#xD;
comes steeped in sensuality. The direction given to&#xD;
the mind, or in other words the state in to' which the.&#xD;
faculties are thrown by the' power of a principle&#xD;
accepted, is . proof withy one against temptation, and&#xD;
he stands; while with the other, a different state of&#xD;
the faculties, brought about by the acceptance of a&#xD;
different doctrine, presents no barrier to thelinroads&#xD;
of sin, and he falls. In this we discover the influence&#xD;
of faith in making the-conduct good or-bad. But it is&#xD;
certainly very clear, notwithstanding, that the faith, is&#xD;
but a condition or circumstance' which operatesoin&#xD;
the state of the 'faculties, and thus determines4he will,&#xD;
and through-it the conduct, or outward manifestation&#xD;
of character."&#xD;

" that you perceive so clearly the nature and ten-&#xD;
dency of those doctrines which form the basis of all&#xD;
radical and efficient social reform; and I might al-&#xD;
most consent to become your pupil in the matter&#xD;
to which you refer. But there is one consideration&#xD;
which you have omitted, and that is that the very&#xD;
noblest of father Adam's progeny have their strong&#xD;
besetting sins. Where the highest mountains are,&#xD;
there are the deepest valleys, and we often find great&#xD;
moral strength coupled with great moral weakness.&#xD;
The mind susceptible of an inspiration which aston-&#xD;
ishes the world with its unearthly brilliance, has its&#xD;
seasons of reaction, and then is dull and sluggish.&#xD;
An insidious temptation, skillfully devised, with&#xD;
a good position and masked battery, opened upon&#xD;
the weakest point at a critical moment, may&#xD;
overthrow a moral giant. But few men, however,&#xD;
are moral giants, and perhaps there is no one of all&#xD;
the children of humanity, but is better off for the in-&#xD;

coming in contact with the moral blight which lurks&#xD;
in a thousand insidious forms in society as it is.&#xD;
When surrounded with temptation as it now exists,&#xD;
the man with weak moral resolve is overcome; while&#xD;
the man with strong moral purpose is pained at the&#xD;
constant effort he is compelled to make in the keep-&#xD;

of sin over his weaker brother, and the moral desola-&#xD;

"A mere doctrine of faith received into the cham-&#xD;
bers of the mind, will not save the soul. If the&#xD;
faith or doctrine is good and true, it is a means of&#xD;
salvation, but not the only one. It may serve as a&#xD;
pilot to carry us through the rocks and shoals ; but&#xD;
it is only by turning it to account in the removal of&#xD;

laws upon which that happiness depends as determined&#xD;
by the divine government. In our second, we ascer-&#xD;
tained that those dogmas which are held- up to the&#xD;
world as talismans:of salvation. and happiness, are&#xD;
altogether inadequate to bring about such mnomen-&#xD;
tous results. In our third, we have ascertained that&#xD;
man is the creature of circumstances, and that his&#xD;
happiness depends on the conditions to which he has&#xD;
been and is subjected. It remains to show how those&#xD;
conditions may be brought about, which are destined&#xD;
to work out for man a far more exceeding weight of&#xD;
glory and happiness than any he has yet expe-&#xD;

NoTE.-I feel impelled to say, by way of a note, that&#xD;
soeof my first reading was Owen and Campbell's debate.&#xD;
I read it a the time to satisfy myself with reference to&#xD;
the historical evidences of Christianity, and was abun-&#xD;
dantly pleased with t1le lawyer-like arguments of Alex-&#xD;
ander Campbell. I was a predestinarian at the time,-and&#xD;
agreed with Owen on the subject of the will, but further&#xD;
than this, his calm, and I might say tame manner of pre-&#xD;
senting his philosophy, made no impression on my unde-.&#xD;
veloped mind. Upon completing the volume, I was&#xD;
deeply impressed with Campbell's -own notion that he had&#xD;
achieved a great triumph, and so I thought no more of&#xD;
Owenism. Nine years afterwards, I wrote the principal&#xD;
part ofte m r in  tis se hapter, just as it occurs here,&#xD;
without knowing or suspecting ,that any one else had&#xD;
treated the subject in a similar way, or made it the&#xD;

came from I did not know. That I did not reproduce&#xD;
the notions of Owen, I know from the fact that when I&#xD;
read him I did not understand, to say nothing of appre-&#xD;
iatin g, his views. And besides that, in treating the sub-&#xD;
sect, viewed it from my own stand-point, andectosire&#xD;
it in the light of Phrenological science, in conecton adi--h&#xD;
my own observation and consciousness. The only addi-&#xD;

resketched the debate, are the paragraphs on blame, in&#xD;
which it will be seen I differ from Owen.&#xD;

"Association, and that only, is the remedy for exist-&#xD;
ing evils. Man is formed for co-operation and broth-&#xD;

two tendencies in his nature. The one pertains to&#xD;
self,the other to his brethren. That, when prevented,&#xD;
becomes cold selfishness and leads to gloomy isola-&#xD;

individual of a due reliance upon self, tends to merge&#xD;
him into the mass, or make him the arasite of others&#xD;

manifestations of fraternity. No part of human&#xD;
nature can be annihilated, though it may be sup-&#xD;
pressed and perverted, or remain undeveloped for a&#xD;
season.&#xD;
"The plan of society which should now be put into&#xD;
operation, is that which would be adapted to man as&#xD;
he is, and calculated, at the same time, to further the&#xD;
development of his whole nature in the full harmony&#xD;
of its constituent parts. Man's individuality must&#xD;
be retained, while, at the same time, his relationship&#xD;
of love and co-operation with his fellow-man must&#xD;
be fully established. True individuality can be the&#xD;
most surely developed when man becomes the true&#xD;
brother of man.&#xD;
"Having felt the wrongs of prevailing social condi-.&#xD;
tions, certain individuals of the race, prompted by&#xD;
the fraternal impulse, have, at different periods of&#xD;
humanitary progress, burst through the barriers of a&#xD;
contracted selfishness, and entered, what seemed to&#xD;
them, the realms of a freer life.&#xD;
"Of these social enterprises, there are two great&#xD;
classes. In the one, a community of goods obtain;&#xD;
in the other, individual possession. To the former,&#xD;
we may refer the Essenes, Shakers, and followers of&#xD;
Owen; to the latter, the followers of Fourier and of&#xD;
Warren.&#xD;
"Of these, omitting the last, who are little known as&#xD;
yet, the communists, so far as the permanency of their&#xD;
institutions is concerned, seem to have been the most&#xD;
successful. But notwithstanding this compliment of&#xD;
experimental success to the principles of the com-&#xD;
munists, those social doctrines which disallow the&#xD;
community of goods, seem to be, in our times, by far&#xD;
the most popular. This may result from the strong&#xD;
hold which cupidity has upon the human heart, and&#xD;
in consequence of which association can only appeal&#xD;
as a plausible scheme to such as talk theory better&#xD;

&#xD;
than liveki'uth. But whether this be the case or not&#xD;
we will presume that individual possession is the right&#xD;
mode in a true scheme of society, and proceed to&#xD;
consider some of the -conditions of association, as&#xD;
they pertain to the theory and practice of the dis-&#xD;
ciples of Fourier.&#xD;
"Fourieristic association, in striking dividends,&#xD;
recognises three claimants:----LaborSkill and Capital.&#xD;
To labor, the scheme gives five-twelfths, to capital&#xD;
four-twelfths, to skill three-twelfths. This basis of&#xD;
apportionment did not stand the test of experiment&#xD;
Capital had undue advantages, and proved too much&#xD;
for labor. In attempting to escape the oppression of&#xD;
capital, labor but expo §ed itself in association to the&#xD;
surer domination of the same tyrant. Those prac-&#xD;
tical-p1att&#xD;
tical attempts failed, and the laborer fled from the&#xD;
barriers they reared to the freer fields of society as&#xD;
it is. The abuses of capital in isolation, and the&#xD;
abuses of capital in association, together with the&#xD;
pangs which labor has suffered in consequence, have&#xD;
led to much inquiry as to the nature of capital, its&#xD;
true uses, and the place which should be assigned it&#xD;
in association.,&#xD;
"In society as it is, we are all witnesses to the&#xD;
mighty power which capital wields in the affairs, not&#xD;
of individuals only, but of states-and. nations. Cap-&#xD;
ital commands all the sources and means-of wealth,&#xD;
and so far as the accumulation of property is con-&#xD;
cerned, it is a god-send to him who has it, and knows&#xD;
how to use it.&#xD;
" If an individual of wealth were toenter an asso-&#xD;
ciation and take his capital along, - it would be a&#xD;
means, if skilfully directed, of making the scheme&#xD;
successfully a money -point of view. Here, then, is&#xD;
the query: Should this member' receive any part of&#xD;
the income as adividend to his capital?  The plan of&#xD;
Fourier, as we have seen, makes this provision, atd&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
134              SOCIETY AS iT IS&#xD;
would give to capital even more than could be right-&#xD;
fully due for the advantages derived therefrom. It&#xD;
will not do to give capital too much in association;&#xD;
but does it deserve anything? and if so, how much?&#xD;
" But first let us inquire a little into the nature of&#xD;
capital, and the manner in which it becomes the&#xD;
instrument of property-getting.&#xD;
" The earth, with its soil, forests, quarries, mines,&#xD;
waters, and atmosphere, is the source of all physical&#xD;
wealth. Food and clothing are drawn directly or&#xD;
indirectly from the soil, the atmosphere, and the&#xD;
waters ; the implements of art, structures for dwel-&#xD;
ling and navigation, from the mines, quarries and&#xD;
forests. But all these are not spontaneously pro-&#xD;
duced and fitted for man's use. The timber must be&#xD;
cut down and shaped into serviceable -forms; the&#xD;
mines must be worked, and much of the material&#xD;
thus procured, carried through various processes of&#xD;
refining, before it is adapted to the uses intended.&#xD;
The waters will only yield up their treasures to man&#xD;
at his bidding. The soil must be tilled for 'the staff&#xD;
of life,' the raw materials of clothing, and the sus-&#xD;
tenance of animals which man uses, in so many ways,&#xD;
laying them under tribute for labor, food and raiment.&#xD;
"The animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms are&#xD;
made available to human uses by human effort. The&#xD;
wealth which they contain can only be realized by&#xD;
labor on the part of man. The earth, therefore,&#xD;
with its mines, quarries, soil, forests, waters, and&#xD;
atmosphere, is the source of all physical wealth, and&#xD;
human labor the means. Wealth is derived by human&#xD;
energy acting upon the materials which Nature&#xD;
affords.&#xD;
"Capital has nothing to do with the creation of&#xD;
wealth. It can neither fell the forest, fish the lakes&#xD;
and rivers, work the' mines, plow the .soil, prepare&#xD;
the food, build the houses and ships, fashion the tool,&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS IT SHOULD BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
135&#xD;
&#xD;
shear the sheep, gin the cotton, nor manufacture the&#xD;
clothing. The human hand, directed by the human&#xD;
mind, so as to take advantage of the mechanical&#xD;
powers through machinery and animals, creates all&#xD;
wealth and makes it subservient to the uses of man.&#xD;
Capital may be made, and is made, by skilful manage-&#xD;
ment, to command the labor of others, and thus.appro-&#xD;
priate the wealth they create to such as control the&#xD;
capital ; but in this transaction the earth is the source&#xD;
and labor the means of all the wealth thus produced.&#xD;
Capital may be the means in existing chaos °of com-&#xD;
bining the labor; but after that, it plays the thief, robs&#xD;
the producer of his own creations, takes the bread&#xD;
from himself and family and gives it tothe capitalist,&#xD;
who is already surfeited, and whose hands are ever&#xD;
idle. Capital exercises none of the powers of pro-&#xD;
duction. In a scientific point of view, it is neither a&#xD;
source nor means of wealth, and has no share what-&#xD;
ever in its creation.&#xD;
.Suppose a colony of persons from the midst of&#xD;
civilization were to go to some island, yet in its prim-&#xD;
itive wilderness. When they get there they have&#xD;
plenty of silver, gold, and bank notes, and all these&#xD;
we will call capital. Beside, they have nothing in&#xD;
the shape of property, except their clothing, and&#xD;
sone implements for which they may find immediate&#xD;
use. The island is theirs-as the earth is the people's,&#xD;
and they must go to work and procure the means of&#xD;
life. There is neither labor nor commodities in the&#xD;
wild woods of their new home to, purchase, and so&#xD;
they have no use for their capital. They are without&#xD;
food and without shelter. One can not provide these&#xD;
things for another, as his own destitution must be&#xD;
supplied. Capital, with all its vaunted potency, is&#xD;
evidently without any avail whatever. The island&#xD;
and all that pertains to it are theirs by right, and&#xD;
nothing but human exertion will administer to their&#xD;
wants.&#xD;

"X Where civilization has fully developed its abuses,&#xD;
the capital would serve to buy up the labor of such&#xD;
as are denied their right to the soil, and have no other&#xD;
means of procuring the necessaries of life than by&#xD;
laboring for those who hold a monopoly of the&#xD;
natural elements, and in consequence, a monopoly of&#xD;
the general means of subsistence. The capitalist&#xD;
alone has the direction of labor; he has forestalled&#xD;
the avenues to its useful expenditure, and the poor&#xD;
laborer is glad to get the privilege of waking even&#xD;
at the disadvantage of giving his employer the one-&#xD;
half or three-fourths of all that ,he produces. But&#xD;
in our new settlement this is not the case. No mo-&#xD;
nopoly there of the fields of labor, and none of the&#xD;
means of life. Each man works directly, or by an&#xD;
exchange of labor, for himself; and so capital is ut-&#xD;
terly useless.&#xD;
"Some engage in the chase, some go with their&#xD;
nets to the waters, others gather nuts and culinary&#xD;
vegetables, and thus they procure their food. Some&#xD;
provide the shelter of temporary huts, and others&#xD;
clear away the forest and prepare the soil for tillage.&#xD;
" At the end of five years, by industry well di-&#xD;
rected, they find themselves in comfortable circum-&#xD;
stances. They have good houses, with enough of the&#xD;
necessaries, conveniences and comforts of life,-&#xD;
they have plenty to eat and wear.&#xD;
"Now whence and how did all these things come?&#xD;
From the crude store-houses of nature, by the hand&#xD;
of man. Capital had no part nor lot in the matter;&#xD;
and thus is all wealth produced.&#xD;
"But we have supposed that these people had&#xD;
capital. They locked it up in their chests, and at&#xD;
the end of five years took it out, and counted it to&#xD;
see what the gain was. In civilization, they had&#xD;
learned to consider that capital was a productive&#xD;
agent, or, at least, that it was self-propagating, and&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS IT SHOULD BE,&#xD;
&#xD;
137&#xD;
&#xD;
would by some natural and inevitable process in-&#xD;
crease in quantity ; or rather, that 'dollars and.&#xD;
dimes' would - beget dollars and dimes, upon the&#xD;
principle that everything brings forth after its own&#xD;
kind. Well, when they came to examine their stock,&#xD;
they found no increase. Jacob of old managed to&#xD;
get an increase of cattle ring-streaked, speckled, and&#xD;
spotted, but our friends of the island hadn't a 'red&#xD;
back' under five years of age; and some-mirabile&#xD;
dictu-were dead !  But this lugubrious mishap, you&#xD;
will understand, Charles, is confidential, and has&#xD;
nothing to do with the present investigation.&#xD;
"If all this capital had been put into one chest, its&#xD;
combined power would have been utterly impotent&#xD;
to add a single farthing to itself. - Such being the&#xD;
case, Is capital scientifically entitled to interest,?&#xD;
As we have seen capital, absolutely considered, is not&#xD;
a productive - power, cannot create, a particle of&#xD;
wealth, therefore, in a scientific point of view, it is&#xD;
not, entitled to any consideration whatever, in the&#xD;
way of interest, dividend, privilege, or any other&#xD;
form of reward.&#xD;
"This is conclusive, but, we will look into the mat-&#xD;
tera little farther.&#xD;
"What is capital? Apart from, the consideration&#xD;
of its employment in trade, it is meant to be the&#xD;
representative of surplus wealth.  If I 'raise.' one&#xD;
hundred bushels of wheat more than I want, I give it&#xD;
to some one who needs it., and receive-in return, one&#xD;
hundred dollars, which.sum I keep as the representa-&#xD;
tive of my surplus wealth. What 1 eat and wear&#xD;
perishes ; what he eats and wears perishes: but all&#xD;
else that we have produced remains, except so far as&#xD;
it is perishable .in itself. My family consumed one&#xD;
hundred bushels of wheat, and - his one hundred-&#xD;
this was all I grew. But I have one hundred dollars,&#xD;
which represents.my surplus production. He made&#xD;

138&#xD;
&#xD;
SOCIETY -AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
two hundred dollars worth of furniture for his neigh-&#xD;
.bor, and consumed one hundred dollars worth of it in&#xD;
wheat, which he procured of me. He has still one&#xD;
hundred dollars left, and that stands for his surplus&#xD;
production.&#xD;
"Now, is the one hundred dollars which he holds&#xD;
and the one hundred which I hold, entitled to inter-&#xD;
est'? My one hundred dollars stands for me in place&#xD;
of my one hundred bushels of wheat, which would&#xD;
have perished in a very few years ; but I saved it by&#xD;
finding a family in need of it. My one hundred dol-&#xD;
lars, as the representative of value, is worth more&#xD;
without interest at the end of five years, than my&#xD;
wheat would have been. In like manner, my friend's&#xD;
one hundred dollars stands with him for half the&#xD;
furniture he disposed of to his neighbor, and at the&#xD;
end of five years will be worth more to him without&#xD;
interest than the furniture would be, inasmuch as&#xD;
he had no use for it, and the alternations of heat and&#xD;
cold, damp and drought, with the accidents to which&#xD;
it would be subject, would injure its polish and dimin-&#xD;
ish its real value. Then, why should either of us&#xD;
get interest for what stands to us as the representa-&#xD;
tive of our surplus productions? In point of science&#xD;
we are entitled to none.&#xD;
" The two hundred dollars worth of furniture&#xD;
which the neighbor got has not received anything in&#xD;
the shape of interest or increase any way, for it was&#xD;
presumed to be worth just the naked sum of two&#xD;
hundred dollars and no more. It is decreasing, not&#xD;
gaining in value, but the use of it is presumed to&#xD;
equal the loss of 'wear and tear.' This two hun-&#xD;
dred dollars worth of property stands against the&#xD;
two hundred dollars which the mechanic and myself&#xD;
hold; for, it was paid first to him and then half of it&#xD;
to me, and now we each hold one hundred dollars of&#xD;
it as the representative of our surplus, which has&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
ANB AS IT SHOULD 'BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
139&#xD;
&#xD;
passed directly from the mechanic, and' indirectly&#xD;
from me into the hands of him who had originally the&#xD;
two hundred dollars. Now, if this furniture -gains&#xD;
nothing in the way of interest, and it cannot, then&#xD;
are the one hundred -dollars which I hold,- and&#xD;
the one hundred dollars which the mechanic holds&#xD;
not'entitled to anything whatever in any form of&#xD;
increase.&#xD;
"It might be objected to this reasoning that inas-&#xD;
much as the two hundred dollars cash in hand involve&#xD;
the probabilities of interest, therefore, when my&#xD;
neighbor pays out for furniture he gives two hun-&#xD;
dred dollars plus the chances of future gain. This&#xD;
however, does not obtain in practice; it cannot.&#xD;
It is the capitalist that gets rich. In consumption&#xD;
there is no speculation. What we eat, wear, or use&#xD;
as furniture, perishes, and by no sort of calculation&#xD;
in dollars and cents, can it be made to affect its price&#xD;
reckoned with interest.  Hear father. Livewell's&#xD;
story:&#xD;
"'Fifty years ago,' said he, 'friend Hardy and&#xD;
myself were out on an excursion, and had to be from&#xD;
home over night. I got supper, lodging and break-&#xD;
fast, for which I paid one dollar ; but he had a lunch&#xD;
in his pocket which cost him next to nothing, and&#xD;
he lay under a big tree and saved his dollar. That&#xD;
he put out at interest next day, has realized ten per-&#xD;
cent per annum compound interest on it ever since,&#xD;
and now that we are old he taunts me with my dear&#xD;
night's lodging.'&#xD;
"It is thus, my friend Charles, that the substantials&#xD;
of life, its necessaries, conveniences, comforts stand&#xD;
at a disadvantage with the representative'of surplus&#xD;
wealth. Scientific equality between them can only&#xD;
be brought about by denying interest to capital.&#xD;
While the means of subsistence get no interest; capi-&#xD;
tal is scientifically entitled to none. This is a math-&#xD;
ematical truth, and there is no gainsaying it.&#xD;
&#xD;
.1&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC7393-00000071"/>&#xD;
"We have now      decided that capital does not&#xD;
produce wealth, and is consequently entitled to no&#xD;
dividend. This, the grand trouble, disposed of, we&#xD;
e may proceed to mature a plan for reorganization.&#xD;
It is proposed that capital shall get nothing,.and la-&#xD;
bor all; that guaranties out of the general income,&#xD;
not exceeding one-fourth of the same, shall be pro-&#xD;
vided against juvenile ignorance, casualities, sickness,&#xD;
old age, &amp;amp;c., and that the admission fee for all resi-&#xD;
dent members shall be one hundred dollars. Shall&#xD;
this be our plan, Charles?"&#xD;
And with these words the Socialist abruptly de-&#xD;
parted.&#xD;
S,&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER X.&#xD;
CHARLES CONSIDERS THIS PLAN.&#xD;
CHARLES thought for awhile, and. then began to&#xD;
write: "It appears that experimental socialism. has&#xD;
not been very generally successful, and so.there must&#xD;
have been some wrong. If the, error has been the&#xD;
dividend given to capital, it does not follow that we&#xD;
apply the remedy in giving all to labor. I admit&#xD;
that scientifically, abstractly, theoretically, absolutely,&#xD;
mathematically considered, capital is.eititled to noth-&#xD;
ing in the way of gain. In atrue state of society it ~&#xD;
would in no manner contribute to the accumulation&#xD;
of wealth, and should, therefore, get nothing. If an-&#xD;
association embraced all the useful handicrafts and&#xD;
natural resources-were a little world within itself,&#xD;
and dependent for nothing, then would capital as an&#xD;
agency of gain be unknown. Mutual exchange upon&#xD;
a just basis would exclude it'. Some ,representative&#xD;
of surplus labor would still exist, but would not' be&#xD;
employed as at present, in buying up human toil and&#xD;
the natural elements, and consequently would.not be&#xD;
capital in the technical sense of the term.~ Labor in&#xD;
that case would be properly rewarded, and the evi-&#xD;
dence, so far as required, of its surplus productions,.&#xD;
whether in the form of metal or paper, not- being&#xD;
used with a view to profit, would, of course, be en-&#xD;
titled to no-dividend, and could get none.&#xD;
" But suppose .I admit all this as' demonstrated.&#xD;
truth, does it follow that in association, which is a&#xD;
trasitiqn from a false to.a true state, capital makes&#xD;
nothing, -and should, therefore, get nothing?  Of&#xD;

I&#xD;
&#xD;
142&#xD;
&#xD;
SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
course not. There is no logical connection between&#xD;
the premises and the conclusion. In the one case&#xD;
society is presumed to be in the true state ; in the&#xD;
other, in a state of transition. The conditions are&#xD;
different, and, therefore, I have no logical authority&#xD;
to assume that money is entitled to no gain in the&#xD;
one case, because it is entitled to none in the other,&#xD;
"There is, moreover, a difference between positive&#xD;
and relative right; between absolute truth and ex-&#xD;
pediency. What is adapted to the condition of the&#xD;
race at one period of its progress may not be adapt-&#xD;
ed to its condition at a subsequent period. When&#xD;
the adaptation between the principle and the stage&#xD;
of human progress is complete, the principle is rela-&#xD;
tively true; but when, by the advance of mind, that&#xD;
adaptation ceases, the principle becomes relatively&#xD;
false. To society in a false condition, principles, even&#xD;
true in themselves, may not be adapted, and their&#xD;
place have to be supplied by those absolutely false.&#xD;
Just so, as long as society is in an unnatural condition,&#xD;
as it will be till peace and happiness are the legitimate&#xD;
result of societa-ry arrangements, so long will the&#xD;
necessity exist which alienates principles absolutely&#xD;
true, and adopts those which, though abstractly false,&#xD;
are relatively true.&#xD;
"For example, to a true state of the nations, war&#xD;
would be utterly unknown. It is intrinsically a fals-&#xD;
ity ; yet such has been, and still is the condition of the&#xD;
moral, social, and political world, that the truly up-&#xD;
right must resort to this means for the vindication of&#xD;
. the rights of man; and in this respect, even war,&#xD;
bloodly, ghastly, cruel as it must be, is justifiable.&#xD;
Washington and his compatriots did right to flash&#xD;
their swords in the face of tyranny; and Hungary,&#xD;
and Rome, and France, and Germany, and the down-&#xD;
trodden everywhere who know their rights, but have&#xD;
them not, would do the bidding of humanity, to&#xD;
&#xD;
143&#xD;
&#xD;
crush their oppressors even by the bloody heel of&#xD;
Mars.&#xD;
"What is absolutely wrong may be relatively right.,&#xD;
Just so, dividend to capital is wrong in an.abstract&#xD;
sense, yet might not ,circumstances exist of such. 4&#xD;
character in a scheme of transition, that justice would&#xD;
demand the dividend ?&#xD;
"In ang association capital, would. be employed -to&#xD;
buy up the material resources of the earth, which&#xD;
should be free, but are not, and therefore must be&#xD;
bought;. and also to obtain the labor of those outside&#xD;
of association, in two ways: directly, by hiring help,&#xD;
and indirectly by the purchase of machinery, which&#xD;
labor has wrought out of- the. natural materials, and&#xD;
thus would capital contribute to the" money-making&#xD;
operations of the community. All this. could not&#xD;
happen in a really true state of society. The metals,&#xD;
'labor notes,' or whatever else- represents surplus la-&#xD;
bor, could not contribute there to the accumulation&#xD;
of property, and so could receive..no dividend. But&#xD;
in an -association they do contribute to the increase&#xD;
of wealth, and should they not, therefore, receive a&#xD;
certain percentage of the gain ? If capital, because&#xD;
it does not increase, in a scientific point -of view, is&#xD;
scientifically entitled  to nothing, why, then, if it&#xD;
does practically increase, is it not practically entitled&#xD;
to reward?  I do not mean to;say that it is. .What&#xD;
I would be understood to say, is, that the, reasoning&#xD;
which proves the representative ;of surplus labor en-&#xD;
titled - to no increase in a true state of society, or&#xD;
scientifically entitled to none, does not prove that it&#xD;
should receive nothing in an association, a state. of&#xD;
society which is but a harbinger of the true one.&#xD;
" In Fourieristic establishments, capital gotla shmre&#xD;
of the proceeds, and all of these establishments but&#xD;
one have gone down. Capital way ka 'canker in the&#xD;
real bone,sinew, and muscle, and dissolution followed.&#xD;

AND AS IT SHOULD BE.          145&#xD;
&#xD;
144              SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
Is not that a reason why capital should get nothing?&#xD;
No. Suppose we form an association and provide&#xD;
that capital shall be rewarded only after labor and&#xD;
skill receive more in association than they can get&#xD;
out of it; then do we abandon the Fourier principle&#xD;
upon which capital in those unsuccessful establish-&#xD;
ments' received its dividends. In these, capital got&#xD;
kill are  paid  m or-erthan  they  get  ouside  The  con&#xD;
ditions in the two cases are totally different, and con-&#xD;
sequently it does not follow that because the Fourier-&#xD;
istic establishment went down ours would too. That&#xD;
is clear enough. Ours might fail, but what I would&#xD;
insist on, is, that its downfall cannot be logically in-&#xD;
ferred from the downfall of the others. There is no&#xD;
analogy, and, therefore, if we' would learn whether&#xD;
ours will or will not fall, we must abandon analogical&#xD;
inference, and resort to independent and original in-&#xD;
vestigation.&#xD;
"But this is not all the trouble. While the plan&#xD;
sketched by my friend gives no dividend to capital,&#xD;
it makes no provision by which more than the initia-&#xD;
tion fee of one hundred dollars is to be brought in&#xD;
and retained. This presumes too largely upon the&#xD;
disinterestedness of those who might see fit to enter&#xD;
association. It places no barrier in the way of the&#xD;
sordid selfishness of such as might be tempted to ren-&#xD;
der service to Mammon.&#xD;
" Men might go into such an establishment with&#xD;
very good intentions, but since no restraint is im-&#xD;
posed on selfishness or speculation; the example of&#xD;
but one delinquent might become contagious and in-&#xD;
fect all the less scrupulous to the subversion of jus-&#xD;
tice, harmony, and good feeling. And it is possible,&#xD;
even probable, if the history of association teaches&#xD;
anything, that such an arrangement would subject&#xD;
the more liberal, generous, and disinterested, to treat&#xD;
&#xD;
meant at once unfraternal and unjust, at the hands of&#xD;
those for whom the 'almighty dollar' has such pa-&#xD;
tent charms. And as to the ,query whether such   I&#xD;
would or would not enter association, let Ceresio and&#xD;
other organizations answer by their sad fate.&#xD;
"A, by hisindustry, has earned two thousand dol-&#xD;
lars; B, by his negligence, nothing. They go into&#xD;
partnership and erect a mill. This absorbs all- A's&#xD;
capital and the labor of both for a year. They put&#xD;
it in operation and attend it themselves. A has the&#xD;
mental temperament in predominance, and to be true&#xD;
to his nature, works but five hours per day. 13 is&#xD;
large and muscular and endures twice as long.- The&#xD;
mill, with their labor, clears them nine hundred dol-&#xD;
Jars per annum. A gets three hundred.; B six hun-&#xD;
dred. B finds this a royal business,'and no better as-&#xD;
sociationist than he can be found in all socialdom.&#xD;
He regularly invests his income in speculation exclu-&#xD;
sively his own. He still continues his partnership in&#xD;
the mill with A, and reaps twice as much from A's&#xD;
capital as the owner himself, while A gets not one&#xD;
particle of the proceeds of his. By means of the sel-&#xD;
fish use of his gains, B finds himself, at the end of&#xD;
five years, a wealthier man than A; and this is the&#xD;
reward of his former slothfulness and present selfish-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
.".Now, precisely such a case of selfishness and in-&#xD;
justice might occur under my friend's plan. There is&#xD;
nothing in its provisions to prevent it. The disinter-&#xD;
ested might bring in funds for the promotion of the&#xD;
enterprise and the good of all, while others would&#xD;
look exclusively to their own selfish interests without&#xD;
returning an equivalent to those upon whose capital&#xD;
they are fattening. Under such a scheme there&#xD;
would either not be enough capital retained in asso-&#xD;
ciation, or if there were, the advantages of economy&#xD;
and the temptation to prey upon the capital of oth,&#xD;

&#xD;

SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
ers would attract the selfish, and thus the generous&#xD;
and fraternal would be victimized as effectually as&#xD;
they now are in isolation.&#xD;
 " But there is still another trouble. It is fine to&#xD;
provide against juvenile ignorance, but .that which&#xD;
attaches to a maturer age should be met as promptly.&#xD;
And further, such as have fairly begun the higher&#xD;
development of mind, should be furnished with the&#xD;
means of carrying it on. The mind should have a&#xD;
guarantee. Let a certain proportion of the income&#xD;
be set apart for books, papers, periodicals, apparatus,&#xD;
lectures, and other appliances of knowledge. It will&#xD;
then be a true school of humanity, and without this&#xD;
it can have no very great attractions for such as are&#xD;
intent upon the development of true self-hood."&#xD;
When the unknown Socialist came the following&#xD;
day, Charles produced his reflections, and they were&#xD;
kindly received.&#xD;
" l'am glad," said the good man, "that you have&#xD;
been thinking. It augurs well for our progress, and&#xD;
I am encouraged to proceed. None but the stupid&#xD;
accept such things without due consideration ; and&#xD;
none but the prejudiced reject them without consid-&#xD;
eration at all. The rational and consistent would&#xD;
obey Paul: 'Prove all things; hold fast to that which&#xD;
is good.' I am glad that you belong to this class."&#xD;
Charles is just one of this kind. He is an admirer&#xD;
of the 'chief apostle to the Gentiles,' and thinks that&#xD;
reformers now.a-days should be as bold, independent,&#xD;
and rational as he.&#xD;
"1 remember well," said Charles in reply to his&#xD;
friend, "that the greatest heroism which has ever&#xD;
dazzled or gladdened the race has been of the hum-&#xD;
blest origin. I remember Moses amongst the rushes,&#xD;
Christ in the manger, Luther an obscure monk,' and&#xD;
very many more lowly and unknown, until, through&#xD;
the prowes of their own great spirits, the world be-&#xD;
came conscious of the depth of the humanity within&#xD;
&#xD;
146&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS IT SHOULD BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
them and the inward fulness of their glory. For this&#xD;
reason I reject nothing because it comes from an&#xD;
humble or an unknown source. But while I reject&#xD;
not, neither do I accept, because of the origin whether&#xD;
high or low, well-known or obscure. Truth is truth&#xD;
whatever the character of the individual medium&#xD;
through which it comes, and I promptly and joyfully&#xD;
accept it,;-and the same is true of falsehood, which&#xD;
I as unhesitatingly reject."&#xD;
"If I have understood you rightly," said the&#xD;
stranger, in allusion to Charles' written remarks, "you&#xD;
urge three objections to the, plan proposed at our last&#xD;
interview, for your consideration.&#xD;
"1. That capital is scientifically entitled to no in-&#xD;
terest, is not proof that it should get nothing in asso-&#xD;
ciation, to the wealth and success of which it con-&#xD;
tributes.&#xD;
" 2. To give capital nothing, and then demand of&#xD;
each member but one hundred dollars as a permanent&#xD;
investment, would not keep capital stock enough in&#xD;
the association, or if it did, would make the disin-&#xD;
terested a prey to the selfish.&#xD;
"3. There are no guarantees to mind; thus neglect-&#xD;
ing the highest interest which it is our pride and glory&#xD;
to cherish.&#xD;
" I admit the validity of these objections, and con.&#xD;
cede at once that they are conclusive against the&#xD;
scheme. All these difficulties will be considered in&#xD;
due time. But with reference to the first I may here&#xD;
say, that, although the scientific conditions of surplus&#xD;
wealth do not obtain in association, yet it does not&#xD;
follow that capital should receive a share of the in-&#xD;
come. What my views upon this.point are,swill ap-&#xD;
pear at our next interview. I will then proceed to&#xD;
show, as you suggest, by independent considerations,&#xD;
what seems to me the true mode of dealing with&#xD;
capital in association.&#xD;

CATER XI.&#xD;
LABOR AND CAPITAL IN ASSOCIATION.&#xD;
"I may observe, in the first place, that in the&#xD;
establishing of an association there are other objects&#xD;
to be kept in view besides, that of mere perpetuity.&#xD;
Permanence is the one thing indispensable ; but this&#xD;
would not be desirable, if the social good aimed at&#xD;
in the undertaking should fail to be realized. An&#xD;
association based upon much falsehood may endure,&#xD;
as the history of association proves. I would aim&#xD;
at something higher than mere perpetuity and suc-&#xD;
cessful money-getting. I would, if possible, establish&#xD;
it upon such principles as are consistent with them-&#xD;
selves and with each other, adapted to the circum-&#xD;
stances with which they are connected, and which&#xD;
would, moreover, in their practical operations, carry&#xD;
out the high purposes for which we enter or should,&#xD;
enter association.&#xD;
"With respect to the reasons for granting or re-&#xD;
fusing a premium to capital, there are two contin-&#xD;
gencies to be looked at. The one has reference to&#xD;
the dissolution of the association, and the other to&#xD;
its perpetuity. Demonstrate the practicability and&#xD;
enduring permanence of an association, and so far&#xD;
from wanting dividend to capital, 1 would not even&#xD;
want capital itself. I want property only as the&#xD;
means of sustaining life and providing whatever may&#xD;
be legitimately desirable. In the wide world there&#xD;
are so many uncertainties, and so much grasping and&#xD;
unfairness, and when charity does come, is so grudg-&#xD;
&#xD;
-i&#xD;
&#xD;
ing and cold, that property, and as much as one can&#xD;
get by the means his conscience sanctions, is what&#xD;
almost every one instinctively pounces upon as the&#xD;
only guarantee against misery and starvation. but&#xD;
in a successful association, certain of perpetuity, the&#xD;
means of life and its comforts would be guaranteed&#xD;
to me and mine and theirs forever. A few hours'&#xD;
labor per day-as much as would retain physical&#xD;
vigor and give me an appetite for food-would suffice&#xD;
for my support, and I would be sure of the same ad-&#xD;
vantages for those who come after me, and in whose&#xD;
welfare and happiness I should naturally feel an in-&#xD;
terest. With these advantages present, and those&#xD;
glorious certainties for the future, I would be con-&#xD;
tent without capital--ten thousand tires more con-&#xD;
tent than now with it. -I would say, therefore, that&#xD;
when fraternal co-operation is demonstrated with&#xD;
respect to present and perpetual success, capital can-.&#xD;
not, upon, any plea of necessity, justice, or expedi-&#xD;
ency, claim anything in the. shape of dividends. And&#xD;
I would, moreover, act upon the: presumption of&#xD;
perpetuity until the omens of a different fate should&#xD;
become 'unmistakable.&#xD;
"But in the event of a dissolution, shall capital&#xD;
get any increase? In such a contingency, the ele-&#xD;
ments of the association- would be separated to&#xD;
mingle again with those of ordinary society. In the&#xD;
affairs of isolation, capital is rewarded, and if it had&#xD;
never been put into association, it would have drawn&#xD;
interest, and should we not in the event of a dissolu-&#xD;
tion, give it something to make up for the sacrifices&#xD;
it has made? Before answering-this question, let us&#xD;
ask another, and see what the answer is.&#xD;
"Should a woman in association receive as much&#xD;
for an hour's work as a man ? It cannot be denied&#xD;
that as a general thing she would make .less money&#xD;
per hour -for the establishment than her more able&#xD;
&#xD;
.E&#xD;
&#xD;

150      j     oCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
bodied companion ; should we, therefore, give her&#xD;
equal wages, or should we not? This question may&#xD;
be answered with reference to the contingencies of&#xD;
perpetuity or dissolution. If the association is to be&#xD;
perpetual, then. as in the case of capital, we can afford&#xD;
to do justice, as scientifically demonstrated and de-&#xD;
fined, and give equal remuneration to both kinds of&#xD;
labor. Scientific justice would give no increase to&#xD;
capital, and. in an association of enduring perma-&#xD;
nency, no apology could be made for any. Just so&#xD;
with respect to male and female labor. Absolute&#xD;
justice would make no distinction in this respect&#xD;
between the sexes, and in an association sure of per-&#xD;
petuity, no sophistry could set up any plea for more&#xD;
reward to one than to the other.. The analogy is&#xD;
complete.&#xD;
" But how would it be in the event of a dissolution?&#xD;
In that contingency, the association would be re-&#xD;
solved into its elements, to mingle again with those&#xD;
of society as it is. In the prevailing social methods,&#xD;
a man gets more for his work than a woman, he&#xD;
would have got more if he had not gone into associa-&#xD;
tion, and now in the event of its dissolution, should&#xD;
we not give something extra to make up for the sac-&#xD;
rifices he has made? It will be readily seen that we&#xD;
have now placed, first, labor and capital, and second-&#xD;
ly, male and female labor, in a position In which they&#xD;
are perfectly parallel. If in the event of a dissolution&#xD;
we persist in making no amends to male labor for its&#xD;
relative losses, we must also persist in refusing inter-&#xD;
est or dividend to capital for the relative losses it&#xD;
has sustained. The parallel is complete, and, if we&#xD;
would be consistent, what we would do in the one&#xD;
case we must do in the other.&#xD;
"Suppose that by way of settling this diffeult we&#xD;
would, in the case of dissolution, make some allow-&#xD;
ance to male labor for its relative losses. *In society&#xD;
&#xD;
151&#xD;
&#xD;
as it is, man is the stronger and gets relatively more&#xD;
than he deserves; woman is the weaker and gets&#xD;
absolutely and relatively less than she is jutly n&#xD;
titled to. By making amends to man for his relative&#xD;
losses, we strengthen the stronger and weaken the&#xD;
weaker, and then turn them out, 'male and female,'&#xD;
amongst the hyenas of prevailing society; the one to&#xD;
triumph and oppress, the other to make herself agree-&#xD;
able to her lord and superior, and merge her existence&#xD;
Into his for the sake of protection. Just so in the&#xD;
case of labor and capital. Labor, in prevailing&#xD;
society, is the weaker, and capital the stronger if&#xD;
we make amends to the latter for its relative losses,&#xD;
we increase the stronger and detract from the weak-&#xD;
er, and turn them out upon society; the one to'tri-&#xD;
umph and oppress, the other to cringe and fawn upon&#xD;
its master for the meanest -reward. I would, there-&#xD;
fore, in the event of a dissolution, make no amends&#xD;
to male labor, and none to capital."&#xD;
"Your analogy is certainly correct," said Charles,&#xD;
" but still it does not prove that capital in association&#xD;
should not get reward.    The false relations of&#xD;
society outside, from which the association cannot&#xD;
wholly free itself, may make the endurance of cer-&#xD;
tain evils a necessity. This obtains in governments.&#xD;
Our nation could not with safety, if it would, neglect&#xD;
its armory,  arsenals, fortifications, army, navy, &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
Such is the state of our frontier and the political&#xD;
world in general, that we must keep up some of the&#xD;
preparations of war. So in association. The laws reg-&#xD;
ulating the ownership and descent of property migt&#xD;
conflict with the internal arrangements of the com-&#xD;
munity, and compel it to endure grievances, take pre-&#xD;
cautions, or establish conditions adapting it to the&#xD;
unavoidable circumstances. Now, might not inter-&#xD;
est or dividend to capital be one of those necessary&#xD;
grievances or conditions? You have not shown&#xD;
that it is not."&#xD;

" That dividend to capital," replied the other, "is&#xD;
not a necessary evil, will appear more fully from&#xD;
what is yet to say. It will be seen that so far from&#xD;
being a necessary evil, it is an evil which, if done&#xD;
away with in association, will facilitate justice be-&#xD;
tween member and member. It has already appeared&#xD;
that justice is subserved by refusing dividend to&#xD;
capital, since by such refusal we disregard that custom&#xD;
of false society which takes from the weaker and&#xD;
gives to the stronger.&#xD;
"If the necessity of the evil should not appear in&#xD;
the course of our investigation, we may fairly pre-&#xD;
sume that it does not exist. As I do not see it, nor&#xD;
know where to look after it, it would seem to be-&#xD;
hoove you, Charles, to show wherein it is. When&#xD;
you say that preparation for war is a necessary&#xD;
evil, I understand you, since I see clearly the neces-&#xD;
sity for such preparation. When you say that the&#xD;
laws of the state regulating property matters might&#xD;
impose restraints on an association, from which, under&#xD;
other circumstances, it would be free, I understand&#xD;
you; since if the internal regulations of the associa-&#xD;
tion are different from those of the state, such pre-&#xD;
caution must be taken as will adapt the one to the&#xD;
other. Now state in what way it is that the consid-&#xD;
erations and emoluments given to capital outside of&#xD;
association will compel us inside to do it like honor,&#xD;
and 1 will look into your arguments.'"&#xD;
"I have no such arguments to present," replied&#xD;
Charles, " I anticipate the disposition you would&#xD;
make of the difficulties, and it was to verify my pre-&#xD;
monitions that I made the objection."&#xD;
"I presume, Charles, we understand each other,"&#xD;
said the Socialist smiling.&#xD;
" If I were to say," continued Charles, "wherein&#xD;
dividend to capital might be a necessary evil in&#xD;
association, I would instance three cases: 1. Justice&#xD;
&#xD;
SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
152&#xD;
&#xD;
betweerrmember and member. 2. To bring capital&#xD;
nto association. 2.  o retain it." -&#xD;
" Charles, you are bring  it tohe points&#xD;
and I am glad of it," responded his friend. _'1t wijI&#xD;

establish justice and to bring ihand retaineapitalit&#xD;
is utterly unnecessary to introduce; the-falsehood of&#xD;
grantig considerations to -an-agent absolutely non-&#xD;
productive.&#xD;
"Since consistency requires it, since justice is po&#xD;
moted thereby, and -since- no neeessitfprevent i&#xD;
capital n association should obtain no dividend.&#xD;
"Now, does it follow from this doctrine thatlabor&#xD;
should get, all?  Certainly not. If there were  o&#xD;
recipients but these two, labor and capital, then in-&#xD;
deed would it follow, that if the latter be allowed no&#xD;
share of the income and increase- of wealth"in an&#xD;
association, labor must get all: but such are 'not&#xD;
the condi-tions. There is another party besides labor&#xD;
and capital; to which a portion of the ineass of&#xD;
wealth may be given.&#xD;
"First, let us attend to what labor should  t&#xD;
how it should get it.g I would give to labor '  that&#xD;
it makes by its own energies, and by the use of the&#xD;
capital it employs, but I would give it no nmore&#xD;

two kids of capital and two kinds of labor  Capital&#xD;
may consist. of labor invested directly by the hand of&#xD;
the workman; or labor invested indirectly -i  the&#xD;
shape of coin, paper, or whatever else may be the&#xD;
representative of labor.  The first kind may be&#xD;
called labor-capital; th'e other inonev-eapitat:&#xD;
Labor consists of one kind,hich brings its reb&#xD;

Labor.capital, therefore, and non-remunerative labor&#xD;
are identical--precisely one and the same thing.&#xD;
"When, therefore, I speak of capital, I mean the&#xD;
two kinds, money and labor-capital; and when I speak&#xD;
of labor with reference to its share of gain,,I mean re-&#xD;
munerative labor only.&#xD;
"In ascertaining what labor makes by its own&#xD;
energies and the capital it uses, let us begin with the&#xD;
year. The first step would be for the association to&#xD;
keep an account of all the time spent in farming,&#xD;
gardening, and whatever else is remunerative, whether&#xD;
the remuneration comes in the shape of productions&#xD;
for domestic use, or money for productions sold. In&#xD;
this account of time make no difference between sex,&#xD;
speed of working, or quality, but. count an hour an&#xD;
hour. Then as the products are gathered, or made&#xD;
available, either by use or sale, make an account of.&#xD;
their value. Out of this sum deduct the wear and&#xD;
tear of machinery, implements, &amp;amp;c., the expense of&#xD;
getting to market, of keeping up teams and the like;&#xD;
and the remainder will be the net proceeds of such&#xD;
labor, assisted by the capital it employs. Divide this&#xD;
result by the number of hours labored, and we get&#xD;
the amount earned per hour. Having now both the&#xD;
number of hours and the net income per hour of all,&#xD;
we can easily reckon what each shall receive for that&#xD;
year's labor."&#xD;
"Al) that, is clear enough," said Charles, "but&#xD;
what will we do with the workman who has spent&#xD;
all his time upon non-remunerative labor ?"&#xD;
"I would say," replied the Socialist, " give him&#xD;
just as much per hour as remunerative labor earns in.&#xD;
that time, during any particular year for which the&#xD;
reckoning is made., Deduct from his year's earnings,&#xD;
thus ascertained, what he is charged with for board,&#xD;
clothing, &amp;amp;c., and the result will show thE amount&#xD;
of labor-capital he has invested for that year."&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS IT SHOULD BE.           155&#xD;
"But," interposed Charles, "suppose I work at&#xD;
non-remunerative -labor the year round, and then&#xD;
want available funds for my education or a visit to'&#xD;
my friends, how am I to get them ?"&#xD;
" There will be no difficulty about that," replied&#xD;
his friend. - "The two kinds of labor for any year&#xD;
are in a sense the common possession of all. In&#xD;
making a dividend of the same, no regard whatever&#xD;
will be had to what kind of labor any particular per-&#xD;
son worked at.. If my labor has been of the remun-&#xD;
erative kind, and yours not--if I want to invest and&#xD;
you not, I am credited with so much stock, and you&#xD;
take the ready -money.   The exchange will be&#xD;
mutual, and so far as any individual is concerned it&#xD;
makes no sort of difference what may have been the&#xD;
kind of his labor."&#xD;
"Again," observed Charles; "is it just to give two&#xD;
workmen the same wages per hour, when one does&#xD;
twice as much as the other in the same time?"&#xD;
"It certainly is just," was the prompt reply,&#xD;
"provided the slow  workman is engaged at that&#xD;
business in the association for which he is best fitted&#xD;
by nature and practice. If nature has given him an&#xD;
unfortunate temperament and mental organization,&#xD;
he may, nevertheless, require as much of this world's&#xD;
good for the sustenance of himself and family, as"the&#xD;
one who can do twice as much labor in the same&#xD;
time. It would, therefore, be unjust to put him off&#xD;
with reduced wsges. But if he does bad work,&#xD;
while there are other occupations in which he may&#xD;
do better, then if he persist in following a business&#xD;
foreign to his capacity, his wages must be relatively&#xD;
reduced. But such cases would seldom happen ;-&#xD;
never, exceptwhen ambition, pride, or vanity out-&#xD;
runs common sense ; for people generally like that'&#xD;
business best, for which their talents fit-them."&#xD;
But," said Charles, "there is another probable&#xD;
&#xD;
l&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7393-00000079"/>&#xD;
SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
source of wealth to the association, besides the earn-&#xD;
ings of labor. The property may increase in value&#xD;
in consequence of the general improvement of the&#xD;
country around. To whom shall ..this increase be&#xD;
given ?"&#xD;
"Well, Charles, that is a matter of some difficulty,"&#xD;
replied his friend, " it is important, too, and deserves&#xD;
attention.&#xD;
"teWith regard to this subject, we may name two&#xD;
conditions:  1. When the, property  has dimin-&#xD;
ished in value, and the question is: . Who shall suf-&#xD;
fer the loss? 2. When it has increased in value, and&#xD;
the question is: Who shall receive the gain?"&#xD;
" Now we must find some rule existing in the na-&#xD;
ture of things, by which to adjust both the loss and&#xD;
gain. If we dispose of the loss according to one&#xD;
principle and the gain according to another, we&#xD;
adopt a kind of partyism, involving inconsistency and&#xD;
injustice.&#xD;
njWell, lay it down as a rule, that capital is merely&#xD;
an engine in the hands of labor, and that when there is&#xD;
gain, labor should get it. It follows, that when there&#xD;
is loss, labor must endure it. But how will this&#xD;
work?   One thousand dollars is invested in a domain&#xD;
for an association, and -in consequence of some unfor-&#xD;
seen calamity, it is reduced in value one-half the&#xD;
first year.. Labor can't sustain this loss. It takes&#xD;
all, perhaps or nearly all the labor to feed and clothe&#xD;
the laborers and their families, and there is little ,or&#xD;
none left to meet the loss, and it will not do to hang&#xD;
an incubus upon the future of labor to weigh down&#xD;
the soul and unnerve the arm of the toiler. Labor&#xD;
results in the production of wealth, and this is either&#xD;
needed for present uses or it is not. What is required&#xD;
for food and raiment cannot be taken to meet pecu-&#xD;
niary losses, and what is not thus required is surplus&#xD;
wealth, and is reckoned as capital within less than a&#xD;
&#xD;
156&#xD;
&#xD;
157&#xD;
&#xD;
year. Indeed, as soon as there is any reckoning&#xD;
made, itis -deemed'capital as much as' that which&#xD;
wascoriginally invested. Unless, therefore, we  run&#xD;
up scores' fot' future labor to 'wipe out,' we cannot&#xD;
'saddle', it with the loss. Our rule is manifestly at&#xD;
fault, and we. must look for another- Since labor&#xD;
cannot be supposed, upon any reasonableagrouds, to&#xD;
suffer the loss, we are not authorized, by any princi-&#xD;
plcease lgrenor justice, to give it the gain in case of&#xD;
increase, unless some other element enter -into.our&#xD;
ruleand determine such a distribution. But such an&#xD;
elementdoes notappear.&#xD;
ofCthpitl, as we have seen, must, from a necessity&#xD;
of the case, have to suffer the loss.* Shall we, there-&#xD;
fore, give capital the gain? ?Capital did not make&#xD;
the gain, any more than labor did, and besides.that,&#xD;
we have, decided -that capital shall 'ntude'ay&#xD;
circumstances, receive increase. We cannot, ethere-&#xD;
fore, give the gain to capital.&#xD;
"Suppose, then, we make our rule such' that all&#xD;
the inmates of the association, without distinction of&#xD;
age, sex, or condition shall get this gain.. Now, this&#xD;
would work very well while, the property increases&#xD;
in value and -there is gain to distribute   but it would&#xD;
not work well when 'there is. decrease in value and&#xD;
lossto endure. A famy with many small children&#xD;
could not very well endure such a divide of misfor-&#xD;
tune. That rule, therefore, which  would give the&#xD;
* This loss would. of course, only be allotted to individuals in&#xD;
Bithe tigeicy of a dissolution, or the withdrawal of 'nembe"s.&#xD;
But if the enterprise, should go on, labor would- actua llysfeh&#xD;

changes of loss and gain to the inmates of an associa-&#xD;
tion, indiscriminately, is not to be relied- on.&#xD;
" We have now tried these three rules:  1. The in-&#xD;
crease to labor; -2. To capital; 3. To the inmates in-&#xD;
discriminately; and these three rules have been found&#xD;
wanting. What then is the true one?&#xD;
" Let us lay down certain principles which are&#xD;
generally admitted as true:&#xD;
"1. It is the highest interest of the individual to&#xD;
act upon those principles which develop the most&#xD;
fully and freely the harmonies of his God-given&#xD;
nature; or, to suit a different style of thinking, we&#xD;
may say that the great object of man's probation int&#xD;
this sphere of existence, is to develop the higher&#xD;
qualities of his nature, and fit himself for the enjoy-&#xD;
ment of happiness here and hereafter.&#xD;
"2. It is impossible to use the means of such exalt-&#xD;
ing culture, unless the individual is relieved from all&#xD;
drudgery of toil more than nature requires for health&#xD;
and a lively flow of spirits.&#xD;
"3. So far as relief from drudgery is concerned,&#xD;
there should be no distinction made between individ-&#xD;
uals on account of age, sex, or occupation.&#xD;
" 4. Lastly, if association would carry out the&#xD;
highest purposes within its reach, it must not only&#xD;
give relief from  brute toil, but also procure the&#xD;
means of high development, and secure the equality&#xD;
of all with respect thereto, in proportion to their&#xD;
needs: and herein would I look for the rule by which&#xD;
to dispose of the gain and loss now under consid-&#xD;
eration.&#xD;
" Let us understand, therefore, that the 'grand.&#xD;
object of association is the greatest good to all, in pro-&#xD;
portion to their needs, and we have the rule. In the&#xD;
case of loss, we apportion it to capital, for capital&#xD;
can bear it best; and by this course we promote&#xD;
rather than destroy the equality of advantages to&#xD;
&#xD;
158&#xD;
&#xD;
SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
the participants. In the case of gain we apportion it&#xD;
to every individual in the association. Our rule&#xD;
would require that we give to each in proportion to&#xD;
his needs; but it would be impossible, in an initiatory&#xD;
step, to reach this in a practical wayr'and so we&#xD;
divide equally to all, old and young,-rich and poor.&#xD;
" This increase ,could only be realized in case of&#xD;
dissolution, or of a sale, or sales, for the purpose of&#xD;
removal, or the bringing in of uninvested funds, and&#xD;
for this reason we may he less scrupulous about&#xD;
attaining to a precise practical, application of the&#xD;
rule. The management of-all that pertains to' the&#xD;
distribution of proceeds and the means of life in&#xD;
association, should be adjusted, as nearly as can well&#xD;
be, upon the principle- herein laid down ; and since&#xD;
there will be available funds, it is to the apportion-.&#xD;
ment of these, more particularly, that we are to look&#xD;
for a stricter application of the rule, and the attain-&#xD;
ment thereby of the real aims and ends of association.&#xD;
The principle embodied iry the rule and the means of&#xD;
giving it practical life, will engage our attention more&#xD;
fully hereafter."&#xD;
"But What," interposed Charles, "if some one&#xD;
should deny your.four propositions, or some one, two,&#xD;
or three of them ?"&#xD;
"Well," responded his friend, "I should not try&#xD;
to convince him-it 'would be useless; 'and we&#xD;
could exchange sentiments on this theme with mut-&#xD;
ual benefit only after'he had advanced so far, morally&#xD;
and spiritually, as to, appreciate the truth of those&#xD;
propositions, in all.-that the principle of -the rule in&#xD;
question demands."&#xD;
"Again," observed Charles; "after you    have&#xD;
obtained the principle, you do not fully recognize; it&#xD;
in the first attempt at application. What is a rule&#xD;
worth, if it is not to he applied strictly to pracTice ?"&#xD;
" This, Charles," said the other in answer, "is one&#xD;

&#xD;
of the necessities to which you but lately alluded.&#xD;
It is out of the question to make a strict application,&#xD;
in a transition scheme, of all the principles we may&#xD;
accept as absolutely true. The false or deficiencies&#xD;
which necessarily obtain prevent the full realization of&#xD;
every absolute truth. The adjustment of the cor -&#xD;
ditions of association, is, to a great extent, a matter&#xD;
of policy rather than of absolute science. The latter&#xD;
can obtain only when the necessities of undeveloped&#xD;
humanity shall be so far removed as to give a -freer&#xD;
scope than now to aspiring man for the actualization&#xD;
of his ideal. More of this will appear hereafter,"&#xD;
"I apprehend," .said Charles, "that there is to be&#xD;
a further discussion of our theme for this interview,&#xD;
and I would respectfully ask:  If capital is to get&#xD;
nothing, why lay it liable to suffer a loss?  Has this&#xD;
difficulty been fully set aside?  Capital is the repre-&#xD;
sentative of labor, and should it not be preserved&#xD;
intact?  Would it not be as wrongful to detract&#xD;
from the value of whatever represents surplus labor&#xD;
as to defraud labor itself?"&#xD;
" An affirmative answer to this query might seem&#xD;
to be very plausible," said the other; "hut still, I do.&#xD;
not hesitate to say that it would be erroneous.&#xD;
There is one condition,indeed, upon which the claim&#xD;
of truthfulness could, with more propriety, be made&#xD;
for such an answer. If the individual who has cap-&#xD;
ital has earned it all by his own labor, then would it&#xD;
be as unjust, in the commercial sense of the word, to&#xD;
depreciate it as to reduce the reward of his present&#xD;
labor. But such would not always be the -case.&#xD;
The scheming of ancestors, the labor of others, the&#xD;
unjust arrangements of society, are the sources of&#xD;
much wealth in the 4iands of individuals who have&#xD;
not bowed themselves to Mammon. But no great&#xD;
deal of such wealth, however, would go into associa-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
&#xD;
A ND AS IT SHOULD BE.&#xD;
Charles observed, that "many who enter associa-&#xD;
tion will have nocapital which-their own hands have&#xD;
not earned.- Shall that suffer loss ?"&#xD;
To which the other replied: "If we could. ascer-&#xD;
tain just what amount of capital has not been earned&#xD;
by the holder's own labor, we might adjust the nmta&#xD;
ter by apportioning the loss to the ill-gottengais.&#xD;
But this could not be ascertained. -      g&#xD;
"By recollecting that those who hold the largest&#xD;
amounts of capital are the most, likely to have that&#xD;
not strictly their own, we, may approach equity by&#xD;
assigning the loss to capital. By such an adjutment&#xD;
those who have the most capital will lose the most,&#xD;
and those who have least, will lose the least.  This&#xD;
might not be absolute justice, but it approaches as&#xD;
near it as anything practical of which I can conceive.&#xD;
" This difficulty shows how hard it is to form rules&#xD;
which will secure 'to all equal and.exact-justice.'&#xD;
The falses of existing society will affect :the regula-&#xD;
tions of an association, and there .is no avoiding it.&#xD;
We can only turn these ugly necessities 'to the best&#xD;
possible account."&#xD;
" There ,is another phase to this affair," remarked&#xD;
Charles. "Suppose that only such, persons enter&#xD;
association as have no capital but what they have&#xD;
fairly  earned. by their own labor; the property&#xD;
diminishes in value ;-now -iho, or what shall bear&#xD;
the loss ?"&#xD;
" There are. but two things-to bear it-" was the&#xD;
response,, 'capital and labor. Even in this case I&#xD;
would mete -thploss to capital, was much as it is of&#xD;
less consequence than labor to the existing necessities&#xD;
of life.&#xD;
"But I should say here, that the contingency of lobs&#xD;
has been discussed more for the sake of giving -yatem&#xD;
and completeness to (the inv-estigation and its results,&#xD;
than from any apprehension that-such-a thing as:s&#xD;
would be likely to occur. The possibility of the&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7393-00000082"/>&#xD;
thing is not denied, but its probability in an associa-&#xD;
tion judiciously managed, would be one of the re-&#xD;
motest things conceivable in this young and thriving&#xD;
country of ours."&#xD;
" But with respect to increase," said Charles,&#xD;
" there is a view of the subject which you seem to&#xD;
have overlooked. The increase of value in the real&#xD;
estate of an association, is the result in part of labor&#xD;
outside, and since the labor in association tends in&#xD;
the same manner to enhance the value of property&#xD;
outside, it might be said that the exchange is mutual,&#xD;
and that,- consequently, labor within is entitled to all&#xD;
the gain resulting from labor without."&#xD;
" We will suppose that it is," replied his friend,&#xD;
"and since we wish to do justice, we will give labor&#xD;
all the gain without any reserve. Now let us see&#xD;
how the plan will work.&#xD;
" A is a delicately formed man, with nervous tem-&#xD;
perament and predominant intellect. B is a six-footer,&#xD;
strongly built, with firm muscles, and not overdone&#xD;
with nerves. More than four hours' physical labor&#xD;
becomes repulsive to A; while B is not satisfied with&#xD;
less than twelve. A, having a higher order of mind&#xD;
than B, has more legitimate wants; and yet, since&#xD;
labor gets everything, he gets only one-third as much&#xD;
means wherewith to gratify them. B loves pelf, and&#xD;
gets it ; A loves to cultivate his better nature, and&#xD;
have his family do likewise, but cannot get the&#xD;
means without imbruling himself by laboring more&#xD;
than is consistent with his constitution; and then he&#xD;
is unfitted for any noble effort of mind. Would all&#xD;
this be right?  Would it not be setting a premium&#xD;
on mere physical energy at the expense of what is&#xD;
intellectually and morally nobler? Is it not possible&#xD;
that after we have escaped from the jaws of capital,&#xD;
we may incur similar danger from mere animal force,&#xD;
nerved and animated by the love of gold? Since&#xD;

humanity has been crushed by' not giving enough to&#xD;
labor, will it be lifted up by giving labor too much'?"&#xD;
"Might not this} difficulty be obviated," said&#xD;
Charles, "by furnishing A with light, easy work, so&#xD;
that he might endure his dozen of hours -with B?"'&#xD;
" That, indeed," responded the other, " would pro-&#xD;
vide A with an amount of means equal to B's, but he&#xD;
has more wants, and still is at a disadvantage. But&#xD;
the great objection to this subterfuge would be, that&#xD;
it disregards A's legitimate attractions, takes him out&#xD;
of his proper sphere, and so damns him. Having a&#xD;
-head, he might escape the penury an'd crushing toil&#xD;
of isolation, but with us, unless -our associationbe in&#xD;
a very flourishing condition, he is inevitably doomed.&#xD;
"But suppose, after all, that' we are not -to judge&#xD;
by effects-.-that the code of justice has no higher&#xD;
meaning than to give labor all it creates-does it&#xD;
follow that labor isr to have all this gain? Is it true&#xD;
that the increase of value-in the property of an asso-&#xD;
ciation is the result of a virtual exchange of labor?&#xD;
or does it not depend upon something entireldiffer-&#xD;
ent? Does it not arise from tan unnaturalstate-of&#xD;
society, which enables capital to monopolize the&#xD;
natural elements, and buy up'the labor of the needy ?&#xD;
It will not'do to say that we socialists have no more&#xD;
land than we need for our own use, and that we-nevei&#xD;
oppress labor. Those outside of association do mo-&#xD;
nopolize the soil and oppress labor; the increase of&#xD;
value results in part from the 'increasing facilities for&#xD;
such 'oppression and such monopoly;' this unaiatural&#xD;
and vicious state of things in close proximity to the&#xD;
association, imparts thereto their fiefitious 'values.&#xD;
And does labor ask to gorge down all that?' As a&#xD;
laborer, I would spurn such wealth. Labor could&#xD;
have no- sort of tittle to values iresting on such a&#xD;
basis; but since it is gain to the association, I would&#xD;
distribute it with a reference to the great purpose,&#xD;

end, and aim of association, and , of life itself, as&#xD;
already specified.&#xD;
" Not only would I reject such gains as a laborer,&#xD;
but also as a holder of capital. I would accept them&#xD;
only upon the grounds of my individuality."&#xD;
" I quite agree with you," said Charles, "and;per-&#xD;
haps enough has been said at this interview, .but&#xD;
there is one consideration which I cannot well for-&#xD;
bear to mention. It is presumed that labor will be&#xD;
made attractive to some extent, at least, under the&#xD;
regulations of an association. Individuals are differ-&#xD;
ently organized, mentally and physically. One may&#xD;
enjoy three times as much physical labor as another.&#xD;
Now, if we give labor all, we pay the members of&#xD;
an association in proportion to the amount of their&#xD;
physical enjoyment, so far as industry is attractive&#xD;
and a source of pleasure. Such a distribution of&#xD;
wealth would hardly be in accordance with correct&#xD;
principle. Should I, for playing at work nine hours,&#xD;
get three times as much for my hand in the game as&#xD;
you, who enjoy but.three hours of the sport?  This&#xD;
may be an extreme statement, but it shows the&#xD;
principle.&#xD;
"$There is another consideration. The reward for&#xD;
this physical enjoyment is the means which enables&#xD;
us to administer to all our wants, physical, organic,&#xD;
moral, intellectual, spiritual. Now, it would hardly&#xD;
seem right for the man who enjoys, or let us say&#xD;
endures, three times as much work as another can,&#xD;
to obtain three times as great an abundance of these&#xD;
means of life. The injustice in this case appears more&#xD;
fully when we consider the fact, as you have already&#xD;
stated, that the individual who is attracted the fewer&#xD;
number of hours to physical industry is the more&#xD;
likely to have higher aspirations and require a greater&#xD;
supply of means for the satisfaction of his wants.&#xD;
And if, in addition to this, we add. the probability&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS IT SHOULD BE.          165&#xD;
&#xD;
that his family may, from number, youth, and feeble-&#xD;
ness, be more expensive to maintain, the injustice&#xD;
becomes more manifest still."&#xD;
"1These considerations, Charles," said his friend,&#xD;
".are to the point. As I conceive, they bear in the&#xD;
right direction. There seems to be a growing 'con-&#xD;
viction amongst socialists, that capital should get&#xD;
nothing, and that, therefore, labor, after meeting&#xD;
slender guarantees, should get all. This is one" ex-&#xD;
treme, as formerly- the dividend of one-fourth to&#xD;
capital was the other. Injustice- to humanity is&#xD;
wrought out at' either extreme." I know, well that&#xD;
the whole sum of productions- is claimed to be due&#xD;
labor, upon the ground that labor is the only 'active&#xD;
agent in the, creal ion of wealth. Admit the princi-&#xD;
ple, resolve society-into its: individuals, and what&#xD;
becomes -of infancy and childhood, of' old age, and&#xD;
infirmity, without means?  They earn iiothi g, and&#xD;
so get nothing, according to the principle, and would.&#xD;
that be the dispensing of an-immutable and eternal&#xD;
law of justice? But suppose that .this difficulty can&#xD;
be explained away by reference to family and the&#xD;
affections, 'still there- are others which do"not adtiit&#xD;
of such an explanation.&#xD;

CHAPTER XII.&#xD;
THE FORMULA OF PARAMOUNT JUSTICE.&#xD;
' In the first place, let us define that basis of jus-&#xD;
tice upon which associations, for the most part, have&#xD;
been heretofore organized. There is a principle called&#xD;
justice, which has pervaded the whole range of social&#xD;
philosophy in times past, and derogated from its&#xD;
character. I do not, by any means, deny that equity&#xD;
may pertain to the operations of the principle in&#xD;
question ; it doubtless'may and does.. The error has&#xD;
been, not in mistaking the particular rule of justice,&#xD;
but in taking it out of its proper sphere, attempting&#xD;
to apply it where it does not belong, and thus doing&#xD;
violence to the best interests of humanity.&#xD;
" The style of justice which prevails in society may,&#xD;
be defined, ' The exchange of equivalents.' This&#xD;
principle, under existing conditions, has its appropri-&#xD;
ate sphere, and it is well that we understand its laws&#xD;
and obey them, too; but to make it the cardinal ele-&#xD;
ment of association is to take it out of its legitimate&#xD;
orbit and derange the harmonies of justice. There&#xD;
is a principle of equity which has a higher meaning,&#xD;
and upon this should association base its government&#xD;
in all that partains to the substantials of life.&#xD;
" This lower principle, to which allusion is had,&#xD;
may, for the sake of distinction, be called commercial&#xD;
justice. It is to the -definition and illustration of&#xD;
this, that Andrews' work on the 'cost principle' is&#xD;
devoted. Upon this principle,- as discovered and ex-&#xD;
plained by himself, and further illustrated byAndrews,&#xD;
has Warren founded his 'equitable villages.'  He&#xD;
&#xD;
n&#xD;
&#xD;
and his school give a new version of the 'exchange&#xD;
of equivalents,; and claim that theirs is.the key to all&#xD;
social reform and true happiness; and to:demonstrate&#xD;
this is the grand object of their writings and practi-&#xD;
cal efforts. So far from recognizing the higher order&#xD;
of justice, Andrews, in the..illustration of his views&#xD;
respecting, objects of charity, emphatically denies it.&#xD;
" Fourier and his disciples, so far as I know, have&#xD;
taken no higher standin this respect than Andrews&#xD;
and Warren, and have not succeeded so well, inas-&#xD;
much as they have not had a definite idea of this&#xD;
kind of justice, while the latter have, or at least seem&#xD;
to have. Fourier, as we have seen, would reward&#xD;
skill and capital as well as labor. A 'raw hand.' en-&#xD;
tering a group is not allowed to draw wages, till  he&#xD;
has proved himself able to do his part, no matter how&#xD;
hard he works, how many wants he has- which&#xD;
ought to be gratified, or how many are dependent&#xD;
on him for the means of keeping soul and body.to-&#xD;
gether. The principle recognized in such an arrange-&#xD;
ment is this:. 'So far as you give to an association,&#xD;
so far will it give to you-quid piq quo-the mutual&#xD;
exchange - of equivalents, value being the rule, of&#xD;
measurement. This would not be justicein the sense&#xD;
of Warren and Andrews. They -have a supreme&#xD;
faith in the exchangerof equivalents, but they ,make&#xD;
cost and not 'al41e the measure of price.&#xD;
" It is very true that the unskilful or slow worker&#xD;
creates less wealth than the more fortunate brother;&#xD;
---his labor is less valuable, and so we will say that&#xD;
it should receive less. Now,,thissounds for all the&#xD;
world like a veritable note from the trumpet of jus-&#xD;
tice;--trumpet, I saty,. for there has been so much&#xD;
noise made in the sacred narmeof. justice, that it is&#xD;
doubtful whether she ever had scales worth the name.&#xD;
Andrews and Warren would reward labor according&#xD;
to the repugnance overcome.. Underasuch anarrange4&#xD;
meant an award workman would fare better    But&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS IT SHOULD BE.&#xD;

<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC7393-00000085"/>&#xD;
16,             SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
neither the principle which recognizes skill, nor that&#xD;
which recognizes repugnance, approaches, as I con-&#xD;
ceive, the true principle to be kept in view, in making&#xD;
a distribution of the proceeds or incomes of an associ-&#xD;
ation."&#xD;
Charles inquired: " You recognize the exchange of&#xD;
equivalents between man and man as a rule of justice&#xD;
founded in the nature of things ?"&#xD;
"Yes, I recognize it as being such under certain&#xD;
circumstances."&#xD;
"AYou claim that there is a higher principle of jus-&#xD;
tice which is outraged, by carrying-the lower rule into&#xD;
all the business relations of life ?"&#xD;
"Precisely so."&#xD;
"What, then, becomes of the unity and harmony&#xD;
of the moral world? Two moral laws exist, which,&#xD;
under some circumstances, are antagonistic."&#xD;
"I might reply in two ways: 1. Metaphysically.&#xD;
2. By analogy.&#xD;
s6I. Unity is not destroyed, because there are cir,&#xD;
cumstances under which the higher law of justice&#xD;
cannot be made to apply. This results from human&#xD;
ignorance and selfishness, and hence commercial jus-&#xD;
tice becomes a necessity, under certain stages of&#xD;
progress, to the original oneness of design.&#xD;
"iAbsolute harmony is not disturbed, since discord&#xD;
can only result from the misguided doings of man by&#xD;
which the inferior law is applied in cases to which it&#xD;
does not properly belong; and this obtains only in&#xD;
undeveloped society, in which the supremacy of the&#xD;
higher law is not recognized. Harmony is a neces-&#xD;
sary result of the reign of the higher law.&#xD;
"2. The physical -universe is full, as every intelli-&#xD;
gent person knows, of examples in which one law&#xD;
supercedes another. Thus the attraction of gravita,&#xD;
tion Is one law and a universal one; the attraction of&#xD;
theagnet is another, and yet the latter may over-&#xD;
come the former. The galvanic current; as shown by&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS IT SHOULD BE.         169&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
the recent experiments of Prof. Page, may suspend a&#xD;
heavy bar of iron in mid-air----thus overcoming the&#xD;
attraction of gravitation. Again, this same law, so-&#xD;
universal in its effects, is overcome by the organic&#xD;
powers of the living vegetable. The sap goes up-&#xD;
ward, though the attraction of gravitation would&#xD;
draw it downward. Now in these examples there&#xD;
is not so much as subservience of one law to another,&#xD;
but, actual antagonism of effects; yet, through the su-&#xD;
premacy of the higher law, unity and harmony remain&#xD;
intact, and the great ends of creation are subserved.&#xD;
"But further: The laws of the animal organism&#xD;
are higher than the laws of chemical action. Whilst&#xD;
the latter act in subordination to the requirements of&#xD;
the organism, they promote its well-being and sub-&#xD;
serve the organic design. It is thus that the -chemi-&#xD;
cal changes which oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon un-&#xD;
dergo in the organs of respiration_ and circulation,&#xD;
administer to the necessary conditions of the organ-&#xD;
ism. They subserve the organic design so long as&#xD;
they act within-.their proper bounds, but if from. any&#xD;
cause they should transcend these, they become de-&#xD;
structive of the very organism itself. Give the lungs&#xD;
pure oxygen to breathe, and this effect would be pro-&#xD;
duced. The chemical laws would still act, but the&#xD;
action, though unexceptionably chemical, would- re-&#xD;
result in violence to the-higher designs of the organic&#xD;
structure. Just so, the law of commercial justice;&#xD;
within its proper sphere, subserves the general and&#xD;
pervading design of progress; but if, like Fourier and&#xD;
Warren, we attempt to remove it-from that sphere&#xD;
and take it into a higher, its action becomes subver-&#xD;
sive of the higher design, and discord and defeat are&#xD;
sure to follow. The subservience under the'- right&#xD;
conditions of the- chemical to the organic forces do&#xD;
no violence to unity and harmony, but really pro-&#xD;
mote them-; just- so,~the subservience of eodnmeriat&#xD;

1*/D&#xD;
&#xD;
SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
justice to the higher principle of progress, so far from&#xD;
militating against unity and harmony, is a step to&#xD;
their ultimate realization in the social and moral&#xD;
world.&#xD;
"But there is a moral phase to this analogy. There&#xD;
is a law which gives to the individual the-right to life,&#xD;
and by virtue of the same law, he must respect the&#xD;
same right in others. He may, nevertheless, take&#xD;
life in self-defence, and thus violate a lower require-&#xD;
ment of the law to vindicate a higher. One law&#xD;
gives to my neighbor the right to life, and another&#xD;
the right to property. But, if good Samaritan like,&#xD;
I should find a brother by the wayside, weak from.&#xD;
bruises and hunger, and I have neither oil nor bread of&#xD;
my own, I must take from the plentiful cupboard of&#xD;
another, even without leave, if by so doing I can&#xD;
save the life of a fellow-being. The law which gives&#xD;
to one neighbor the right to life, is higher than that&#xD;
which gives to the other the right to property. I&#xD;
can obey the higher only by disobeying the lower,&#xD;
and I do so without violence, so far as the laws and&#xD;
rights are concerned, either to unity or to harmony.&#xD;
"But owing to the difficulty of giving a precise&#xD;
expression, by means of human language, to every&#xD;
idea, it is not correct to speak of my takingoil and&#xD;
bread from my neighbor's cupboard in the case sup-&#xD;
posed, as a violation of his right to property. He&#xD;
has the right to property, it is true, but when his&#xD;
neighbor is on the point of starvation, he has no&#xD;
right to as much of his abundant means as will be&#xD;
required to save the famishing man. His neighbor's&#xD;
right to life being higher than his right to property,&#xD;
supercedes it, so far as its title to the necessary&#xD;
amount of oil and bread is concerned, and in taking&#xD;
them from his cupboard, even by force, I do no vio-&#xD;
lence to his right of property. Just so with respect&#xD;
to taking life in self-defence. If the murderer attacks&#xD;

&#xD;
me under such circumstances that I cannot save my&#xD;
life but by taking his, he forgets his own right to life,&#xD;
and in taking it, therefore, I violate no right of his.&#xD;
In the moral world, philosophically considered,&#xD;
there is absolute unity and harmon.. The&#xD;
laws cannot ideally conflict/wit. ech ottr It is&#xD;
only practically and necessarily  at they do so  In&#xD;
all cases of seeming, antagoiism the higher law&#xD;
ideally supercedes the lower, and thereby subserves&#xD;
under the grand scheme of progress, the very&#xD;
poses of unity and harmony. But, practically  f a&#xD;
man misapprehend the divine decrees, mistake the&#xD;
lower for the higher law, and attempt to enforce it&#xD;
where it does not legitimately apply, discord and&#xD;
misery follow. What we have to'effect in this mat-&#xD;
ter is to ascertain the grade of the-various laws, the&#xD;
stage n progress they apply to, and thn if we retain&#xD;
each in its proper sphere, harmony and happiness&#xD;
will result. The ideal will be actualized; the abo-&#xD;
lute made practical.&#xD;
"Justice requires that we respect the right to pro-&#xD;
perty, but as many rights as there are higher .than&#xD;
this, just so many have a higher claim to s tisfaction-&#xD;
and until this satisfaction' is given, the right to pro&#xD;
perty, in all cases of seeming contagonism,must ive&#xD;
way ;-it has no claims--does not xist. The right&#xD;
to life, as has been stated, is a higher one,and against&#xD;
the satisfaction of this'right that to property has no&#xD;
existence whatever. But besides this, are there no&#xD;
other rights which an association should place above&#xD;
the right to property?  This is a question of vital&#xD;
importance, and, as it seems to me, deserves to be&#xD;
well considered,&#xD;
"Suppose, for example, I find a family in need,&#xD;

abundance to the supply of so urgent a need? Is&#xD;
my right to superabundant property a higher one&#xD;
than my brother's right to moral and intellectual&#xD;
improvement ? Do God and nature give me the&#xD;
right to surfeit in the midst of luxury, and to him the&#xD;
necessity of starving- to death the highest wants&#xD;
which pertain toth hanan soul? If I have not the&#xD;
right to superabundet means which another needs,&#xD;
has he not the right in an organized capacity with&#xD;
others to take them? State governments act upon&#xD;
this principle, and it would not become a community,&#xD;
aiming at the highest good of humanity, to take a&#xD;
lower stand.&#xD;
" Our state abstracts from the wealth of the rich,&#xD;
for the benefit of those destitute of- property and&#xD;
the means of education. The wealthiest man of your&#xD;
township has no children to send to school, and never&#xD;
received the benefit in his own family of a school-.&#xD;
tax, yet he pays more than any of his neighbors for&#xD;
school purposes, and they receive the immediate ben-&#xD;
efits. Some who know of no higher form of .justice&#xD;
than that which pertains to trade and commerce, re-&#xD;
gard school-taxes as most abominably unjust, but it&#xD;
would hardly become socialists to do so. The ed uca-&#xD;
tion of our youth is a demand of their highest nature,&#xD;
and that law which makes provision therefor carries&#xD;
out the highest intentions of moral justice. I know&#xD;
very well that the friends of pubhc schools justify&#xD;
them to the people upon the grounds of the necessary&#xD;
relation which education bears to the perpetuity of&#xD;
our free institutions and the security of property. But&#xD;
this only means that education draws out -the noblest&#xD;
powers of the human soul, and, in so doing, recom-&#xD;
mends itself as the best guarantee of property and&#xD;
republicanism.&#xD;
" It will not explain away this analogy to say that&#xD;

&#xD;
property by the power which his capital gives him&#xD;
to monopolize labor and the soil, and that he is thus&#xD;
enabled to pay his taxes, not by his own industry&#xD;
but by that of others. This principle is not recog&#xD;
nized by our state policy. It accords to the individual&#xD;
the right to- all the property he can get by such&#xD;
means as obtains the general sanction of society -It&#xD;
recognizes the right -of the speculator to all his&#xD;
..property, but it also claims for itself a right which&#xD;
...-supercedes this, and by virtue thereof it takes of the&#xD;
rich man's funds and appropriates them to the educa-&#xD;
tion of the poor man's children.&#xD;
" Since governments-ven despotisms--are - re-&#xD;
cognizm g the highest wants of the human soul and&#xD;
contributing to their culture and gratification, to the&#xD;
evident discomfiture of-that selfishness which knows&#xD;
nothing nobler than the possession of property, should&#xD;
not- socialists, who have means beyond their own&#xD;
needs, contribute freely and willingly of their super-&#xD;
abundance, to the moral and intellectual culture of&#xD;
their less favored brethren ? Should they not grant&#xD;
these bounties for so noble a purpose, not as a chari-&#xD;
ty, but as a satisfaction to justice ? in an organized&#xD;
capacity; should not provision be made in the shape&#xD;
of guarantees for the highest wants of all? There&#xD;
are bounds, of course, to human effort, but thee-&#xD;
tent of such provision in association, until the maxim&#xD;

SOoIE'T AS IT is&#xD;
&#xD;
tion, with the means of life guaranteed to them and&#xD;
theirs, socialists should practically recognize that&#xD;
principle which demands the highest culture of all.&#xD;
" The highest form of justice demands for each in-&#xD;
dividual of the race, those conditions, means, and op-&#xD;
port unities which contribute most to his happiness.&#xD;
" This I regard as the highest plane of moral and&#xD;
distributive justice. I hold that an association, to&#xD;
do the most good possible, must regard it as such&#xD;
and strive to ascend. I would make the principle&#xD;
embodied in the formula, paramount, constitute it the&#xD;
soul of socialism, and have it infuse life and vigor into&#xD;
every nerve, limb and organ of the social body..&#xD;
And I maintain that in order to this all secondary&#xD;
principles of justice must yield to the supremacy of&#xD;
this one. If we drive the smaller satellites into con-&#xD;
tact with the central sun, we turn them from their&#xD;
proper orbits as the fact of collision proves.&#xD;
" Fourier and his disciples did violence to this cen-&#xD;
tral principle of justice, by the very means they in-&#xD;
stituted to promote it. They did well in their at-&#xD;
tempts at transition to recognize individuality in&#xD;
property matters, to merge property interests, and de-&#xD;
stroy competition, but. they erred in the measures of&#xD;
justice they adopted. In holding it just to -reward&#xD;
capital and skill, they adopted the principle without&#xD;
providing against the legitimate issue of such an&#xD;
abuse of absolute justice. The fact of granting such&#xD;
a reward, unbalanced by counteracting provisions,&#xD;
shows either that the highest form of justice was not&#xD;
in view when such measures of recognition were ta-&#xD;
ken, or else that the discrepancy between this high&#xD;
order of justice and the policy adopted, was not dis-&#xD;
cerned. Later socialists of this school would give all&#xD;
gains to labor, and by thus setting a premium on an-&#xD;
iiaal force, outrage the same cardinal principle, and&#xD;
promote sensuousness rather than the harmonious&#xD;

the relations of life to which justice is to have ac-&#xD;

poses of our being.&#xD;
"Schemes like these, and such as the later Fourier-&#xD;
ites would set on foot, may make very successful&#xD;
money-getting establishments; but if they ever effect&#xD;
anythingrof consequence for the ennobling of man,&#xD;
it will not be because such a result is a necessary part&#xD;
of the systems, but because elevated and elevating&#xD;
minds have exerted an influence and produced an ef-&#xD;
fect not provided, or in the scheme. Nothing, it seems&#xD;
to me, could be  better calculated to foster the pro-&#xD;
perty-getting propensity already too strong,---to fos-&#xD;
ter it at the expense of what is nobler, and develop&#xD;
the selfishness, envy and hate consequent upon the&#xD;
individualization and competition of property inter-&#xD;
ests, than the strife for the possession of labor notes on&#xD;
others, as provided for in the economy of Warren's&#xD;
equitable villages. If anything higher than earth-&#xD;
prone instinct is developed under such social regula-&#xD;
tions, it will be when a Christ has risen in Nazareth.&#xD;
It must be developed by an independent energy con-&#xD;
trary to the legitimate tendencies of the, system.&#xD;
Since I feel it with all the energies of my nature, I&#xD;
must say that so long as associations continue to be&#xD;
organized as heretofore, upon such narrow principles&#xD;
they must continue to bring odium even upon what&#xD;
is good in socialism.' Commercial justice, in what-&#xD;
ever way defined, will not carry men, nor -enable&#xD;
them to go into the higher regions of moral, intellect.&#xD;
tual, and spiritual development.&#xD;

SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
labor well rewarded, humanity will right itself, and&#xD;
the highest happiness dawn upon the world. This&#xD;
may be a very natural conclusion. The world is&#xD;
cursed now because labor is wronged of its just dues.&#xD;
Labor is the only productive agency. Give labor,&#xD;
therefore, all gains, and justice being thereby done,&#xD;
misery- will flee from  earth.   But will it be so ?&#xD;
Speculative cunning and artistic skill absorb nearly&#xD;
all of the world's wealth now; under the proposed&#xD;
arrangements animal energy will absorb it all.      In&#xD;
escaping the tyranny of capital, we submit to the&#xD;
tyranny of physical force exerted in the production&#xD;
of wealth. The highest attributes of mind are slaves&#xD;
in either case, to a master which can have no appre-&#xD;
ciation of their claims. If I am to be a slave in either&#xD;
condition, let me serve under the dominion of capi-&#xD;
tal. I would as lief take my chance in the mental&#xD;
conflicts for wealth, as in those of mere animal force.&#xD;
I would as soon trust to the generosity of the man&#xD;
who gets property by his wits, for the means of ele-&#xD;
vating humanity, as to another, who, under a differ-&#xD;
ent arrangement of society, gets it by virtue of mus-&#xD;
cular endurance. It is true, that in the latter case&#xD;
there could not be such depravity in the wealth of&#xD;
individuals, but mind would stand no better chance&#xD;
for elevation. And so far as general enterprise and&#xD;
public improvements are concerned, there would be&#xD;
little or no chance at all."&#xD;
*" Providence overrules evil for good." Crushing evil obtains&#xD;
in society as it is, but this very evil is developing good, and will&#xD;
do so more and more until the evil itself shall pass away. The&#xD;
existing social conditions throw the surplus wealth into the hands&#xD;
of the few, Enterprise gets it; and this same enterprise improves&#xD;
the harbors, extends the telegraph, makes the railroad, opens the&#xD;
mine and builds the manufactory. It does so. the more effectual-&#xD;
ly to make labor the more subservient to itself, but it will defeat&#xD;
its own purposes ;-labor will triumph, and then will all these&#xD;
and works of physical improvement fall into the hands of the&#xD;

stern, immutable decrees of justice, to maintain them.&#xD;
The needy demand the means of physical support&#xD;
as a right; and those who can do so, should furnish&#xD;
them upon the same principle.&#xD;
S"After having provided for man's physical susten-&#xD;
ance, the association should look to the higher means&#xD;
of his happiness. It should furnish music, sports of va-&#xD;
rious kinds, and arrange its grounds and edifices with&#xD;
a view to the esthetic culture of all. But especially&#xD;
should it furnish what is more properly moral and in-&#xD;
tellectual stimulus. Music, proper sports,, beautiful&#xD;
groves, gardens and edifices, all contribute more or less&#xD;
to this high end, but they furnish more immediate grat-&#xD;
ification and culture to the senses. Newspapers,&#xD;
periodicals, books, conversations, lectures, -essays,&#xD;
specimens in natural history, scientific apparatus; all&#xD;
these, together with the social meetings necessary to&#xD;
realize and enjoy the advantages thereof, administer&#xD;
more particularly to the intellectual and moral being.&#xD;
Some of these the association should invariably pro-&#xD;
vide - others it should procure if able, as members be-&#xD;
come qualified to use them and profit by their use.&#xD;
The wealth of the establishment should be used in&#xD;
such a way as to develop the noblest energies of the&#xD;
soul, and contribute to the gratification of its noblest&#xD;
aspirations.&#xD;
" It is in this way that we would make amends to&#xD;
the more intellectual and spiritual, for the advantages&#xD;
which the muscular man has over them in the dis-&#xD;
tribution of the yearly proceeds. It is thus- that we&#xD;
would make.our policy subservient to the demands of&#xD;
paramount justice. This end would not be attained&#xD;
by~giving all wealth to labor. The greatest toiler in&#xD;
the reation of products, and therefore the wealthiest&#xD;
man, is, by .a necessity in the nature of things, more&#xD;
alive to the sensuous and less to the intellectual and&#xD;
spiritual, than his bQrother who expends less of his&#xD;

"Reward to capital would be the violation of a&#xD;

" To give all to repugnance overcome, according&#xD;
to Warren's scheme, in which each one is allowed to&#xD;
estimate the cost for himself, is to give the. advantage&#xD;
to those who can manage to feel the least repugnance.&#xD;
Competition is permitted, and the coarsely -organized&#xD;
individual, who chooses to spend ten or twelve hours&#xD;
per day in physical labor, can afford to rate his re-&#xD;
pugnance at a comparatively low cost, and .yet ob-&#xD;
tain an abundance of all that he needs; while the&#xD;
individual, with. a high wrought temperament. and&#xD;
intellectual attractions, is obliged to put his estimate&#xD;
of repugnance at the same low rate, perhaps even&#xD;
lower, or else get no employment. The consequence&#xD;
is, that the latter is compelled to toil as long or long-&#xD;
er than his more muscular brother, for .,the -same&#xD;
amount of wealth; whereas he may require several&#xD;
times as much to .supply all his properwants. To&#xD;
give all, therefore, to repugnance overcome, is .to&#xD;
overlook the principle of paramount justice, and; dis-&#xD;
regard the true interests of the human soul.&#xD;
" It will not do to say, as Andrews does, that there&#xD;
will be an abundance for all, and that consequently&#xD;
the most highly organized have no reason to com-&#xD;
plain. This expositor admits that the coarsely or-&#xD;
ganized individual will get more means while he needs&#xD;
less, and the highly organized one less, while he needs&#xD;
more. This is not a true condition of things, but the&#xD;
reverse; and yet it is the legitimate resultof a sys-&#xD;
tem which .claims to be true science. The wrong&#xD;
conditions, as I conceive, result from wrong principles.&#xD;
If- any scheme of society do not result theoretically&#xD;
in true conditions, it is not a true scheme.&#xD;
"In ascertaining the true science of society, or&#xD;
more correctly, the true social policy, what we have&#xD;
to do is, first, to ascertain what are the true condi-&#xD;
tions to be brought about, and then, trace the opera-&#xD;

But more of this at our next interview. Now lets&#xD;
try that sentence again:&#xD;
"Scientfically considered, paramount justice&#xD;
quires,that wealth be so distributed as to get eack&#xD;
in proportion to his physical, mental and spirit&#xD;
needs.&#xD;
"Is not that it? If such is not -God's truth, I am&#xD;
deeply in error, th.t is all"&#xD;
"Then," said Charles, "you do not recognize the&#xD;
right of propery. as based upon the right-of the in.&#xD;
dividuaJ to thel proceeds of his own labor ?!.P&#xD;
" As pertaining to the-trie order.of soiery, Ie&#xD;
cognize no right of property at all," said his friend.&#xD;
"I recognize, under such circumstances, the right to&#xD;
property, and that, as based upon the right to life&#xD;
and happiness."&#xD;
"Withrespect to your formula for the distribution&#xD;
of wealth,".inquired Charles, "would it be applica-&#xD;
ble to the government of an association?"&#xD;
" Not at the present time," was the response.&#xD;
"Man is not prepared for this yet. There are two&#xD;
reasons why he.is not: 1. He is too low in spiritual&#xD;
development. 2. Wealth is not sufficiently abundant;&#xD;
nor the means of producing it sufficiently Knatured.&#xD;
Until these two conditions obtain, the science of so-&#xD;
ciety can never be realized. But if we cannot reaclh&#xD;

eessity,,but strive to approximate the ideal as nearly&#xD;
as possible. Atsuch 'approximation should the policy&#xD;
of association aim. This is a work for practical skill.&#xD;
Others have-failed and so may we, but let us hope.&#xD;
"If I were to write a formal constitution as the basis&#xD;
of agreement between the members of association,&#xD;
I would, in view of the considerations presented at&#xD;
this interview, begin it somewhat in this wise.&#xD;
6Being well convinced -that the highest demands&#xD;
of justice require the distfibution of wealth to be&#xD;
made in such a way as to administer, as far as possi-&#xD;
ble, to the greatest happiness of all, according to their&#xD;
physical,rmental and spiritual needs, do we the un-&#xD;
dersigned hereby 'pledge ourselves to, the good of&#xD;

same time they mar some of its existing truths; and&#xD;
hence there are social regenerators who would have&#xD;
us understand, that as all the faculties of the human&#xD;
mind must be provided for in the true state of society,&#xD;
consequently those schemes which disregard the&#xD;
cravings of the property appetite, as generally ex-&#xD;
perienced, are false, not adapted to the wants of&#xD;
human nature, and must fail. Hence it is a great&#xD;
point with the paper builders of society and their&#xD;
reviewers, to make a distinction between association&#xD;
and communism, and then inform their readers that&#xD;
the difference is heaven-wide, and themselves opposed&#xD;
to the latter.  This, it is very certain, is an effectual&#xD;
reach for more consideration, from the. mass of read-.&#xD;
ers, and those who are yet chained to the car of &amp;amp;am-&#xD;
mon, but it surely is not the true propounding of&#xD;
social science.  Something may be done in this&#xD;
manner, by way of transition, but I hold that if man&#xD;
would realize all that is now within his reach, he&#xD;
must rise above the low, sensuous, earth-prone spirit&#xD;
which now too generally pervades society, and&#xD;
curses it with the wrongs of a most unwarrantable&#xD;
selfishness.&#xD;
"'But must we not take man as, we find him?'&#xD;
Most assuredly. And if we find him unfit for a higher&#xD;
state of society, we must leave him in the lower,&#xD;
promote universal education, diffuse universal science,&#xD;
and await the future for the general realization of&#xD;
peace, harmony, and happiness. But if there are&#xD;
those who have really advanced beyond the sordid&#xD;
selfishness of the times, and are prepared to enter&#xD;
the beautiful and well-proportioned social temple,&#xD;
wherein they may unite as they would with true&#xD;
brethren upon brotherly terms, then should we ex-&#xD;
pect to witness the actualization of all that dwells In&#xD;
the ideal, and is longed for, and hoped for, and to&#xD;

"Our problem is now stated. The propensity for&#xD;
the gecumulation of property 'with a, view to individ-&#xD;
ual and selfish possession, rather than use, does exist&#xD;
in the human heart, is almost universal, and hece&#xD;
it is concluded, that the, true. state of society must&#xD;
provide, for its gratification. I deny that tis is a&#xD;
correct view of the case, and must-endeavor to showv&#xD;
wherein-I deem myself to escape the-seeming. abser-&#xD;
dities of my position. I certainly d ,naih-tain, that&#xD;
the faculties which men really have, must, under the&#xD;
proper circumstances,:each and every one without&#xD;
exception, be used;, and so far as happiness depends&#xD;
upon their action, must be. provided for in, eyery&#xD;
scheme- of society which is designed to be of perma-&#xD;
nent and practical benefit to the race. But, I-deny&#xD;
that this getting of individual property. by isolated&#xD;
effort, for. selfish possession and- emolument, is'a&#xD;
normal and legitimate propensity of the.human-mind.&#xD;
I admit its legitimacy .in one-sense, and I would be&#xD;
sadly. at fault as to the requisitions of true philosopy&#xD;
if I did not admit that as society exists, this propeni&#xD;
sity is justifiable, because -adapted' to the circum-&#xD;
stances in which man is placed. Whoever does not&#xD;
attend to the acquisition of the means of'life as best&#xD;
he can, even with all the world against him,fails in&#xD;

socr'   As rr is&#xD;
without such kicumbrances. But I am upon the&#xD;
border of ' cantankerous heresy,' and must not antici-&#xD;
pate my subject.&#xD;
"Now, why is it that every individual feels that&#xD;
he must gather as much unto himself*as possible?&#xD;
The answer is simple. Society is so arranged that it&#xD;
.is a necessity thus to do, or at least he feels it such;&#xD;
and this state of things has so long obtained that the&#xD;
feeling has beoome habitual, a second nature. The&#xD;
man must starve if he do not provide well. -He may&#xD;
be laid upon the sick couch, and if he has not 'laid&#xD;
up' for such a contingency, there is danger that&#xD;
others will supply his needs with too-scanty a hand,&#xD;
or not till it is too late. Thus it is 'that such as are&#xD;
not really improvident, must not only supply their&#xD;
present wane, but lay in store for the contingencies&#xD;
of the future. Considering the circumstances, this is&#xD;
all right: I have not a word of fault to find with it.&#xD;
What I do fault, is the.rircumstances, that the indi-&#xD;
vidual must do all by isolated effort, as though he&#xD;
were alone in the world, without a friend among&#xD;
his own kind. The individuals of his own race are&#xD;
in fact his enemies, so far as the acquisition of wealth&#xD;
is concerned. Each is grasping for himself, and the&#xD;
more any one gets the less can others obtain. If&#xD;
one gets any particular article of' property, no one&#xD;
else can. It is his to the exclusion of all others, and&#xD;
with reference to prospective use, they can. take&#xD;
no interest therein. This struggle for the exclusive&#xD;
ownership of the most property possible, is unquali-&#xD;
fied antagonism, and only so far as overruled by the&#xD;
better instincts of our own nature, is it notdown-&#xD;
right enmity.&#xD;
" That instinct of our nature which induces us to&#xD;
provide for the wants of our natures is a legitimate&#xD;
one.- This proposition I do not dispute. The ain-&#xD;
stl ig  Ged-given, and right in its nature, but society&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
has, perverted it. The,intei'est -of the selfish, and&#xD;
sordid individualism which has ahutofore preveliled,&#xD;
and which still prevails, has given an improperdiree.&#xD;
tion to the wealth=creating faculties. 'Under the in-&#xD;
fluence of that improper .direction, society now&#xD;
groans, and it will groans till men are developed be-&#xD;
yond the sphere of sordid selfishness into a higher#&#xD;
and purer atmosphere.&#xD;
"II have said that -the instinct, faculty, or sense of&#xD;
property, is'a"natural and legitimate one. NOW,&#xD;
what is its true purpose, end, aim,or function?  The&#xD;
answer is easily given, because involved in th'e 'delini-&#xD;
tion of the faculty. To procurefor the 'itdibidzzal&#xD;
the means -of gratifying his- legitimate wantsthtsi--&#xD;
':But, if these wants pertain to .he-.individua'l,&#xD;
should not the individual, provide for 'them  in his&#xD;
own case, upon his own responsibility, and by his&#xD;
own unaided efforts.? N y. And I answer thus&#xD;
because man is a social being. Man is social, and&#xD;
the interchange of kind offices and mutual aid with&#xD;
friends is a source of happiness; and with the many&#xD;
his joys are increased and troubles diminished. An&#xD;
individual all alone could have but little sto become&#xD;
joyous over, and would be 'full of trouble.' In the&#xD;
strife for property, he is essentially alone. There are&#xD;
none to -rejoice with 'him when he is successful, and&#xD;
when he fails, he must meet' the dragon of adversity&#xD;
single-handed.  This I ,hold to be "unnaturialand&#xD;
degrading. It is felt evernow. The more advanced&#xD;
are unhappy 'that this isolation and antagonisn'pre-'&#xD;
vails, whether they are conscious of the source of their&#xD;
unhappiness or snot. If enlightened as to this point,&#xD;

content with the rewards of a lower sphere until&#xD;
they reach a higher; nor presume to judge what they&#xD;
cannot comprehend, or dictate to such as have passed&#xD;
beyond. them.&#xD;
-, *Property-getting, as at present carried on, will&#xD;
not be readily abandoned, for this very good reason,&#xD;
that the race is still so low, in development that&#xD;
there is but little outlet for its aspirations and ener-&#xD;
gies but in the qualification of the property-getting&#xD;
propensity, either as an end or the means to other&#xD;
ends equally as base.&#xD;
"Man, in his present stage of progress, has devel-&#xD;
oped but the presage of his nobility, and his aspira-&#xD;
tions are yet'grovelling; hence, if we place him in&#xD;
easy circumstances, and relieve him from the care of&#xD;
providing for his daily wants, he would be unhappy.&#xD;
He must be engaged, and as the acquisition of prop-&#xD;
erty by individual effort constitutes the length and&#xD;
breadth of his aspirations-they have but little height&#xD;
---it is into this channel that he directs his energies.&#xD;
However vulgar his ideal, and base his actual, he&#xD;
seems -content with himself, and looking from  his&#xD;
own plane, would despise us for attempting tqameli-&#xD;

for making him happier,-are not adapted to his wants,&#xD;
and would only derogate from what he already-en-&#xD;
joys, without adding anything in a different direction&#xD;
as a recompense for the loss. He would prefer to&#xD;
work-out his own -salvation in his own way.:&#xD;
" We hear peoplesay that they are not as happy&#xD;

"And herein may we detect an error in thepolicy&#xD;
of a numerous class of socialists. They would hav.&#xD;
government attempt the reorganization of society-==&#xD;
thus beginning at the wrong end.    Government&#xD;
may remove obstacles, and smooth the path for the&#xD;
oppressed worker to flee the bondage'of his industrial&#xD;
Egypt. It may contribute to his mental culture, and&#xD;
must do so that lie may enter into a freer and fuller&#xD;
communion with himself, understand his own real&#xD;
wants, and appreciate his true relationship with&#xD;
others. This done, he will be prepared for something&#xD;
better in the form of reorganization, and will efect&#xD;
it for himself, without the interposition' of arbitrary&#xD;
law.&#xD;
"The man must be moved by a nobler aspiration,&#xD;
and feel his needs, before the reorganization -of society&#xD;
will greatly benefit him. On account: of the lmnat-&#xD;
ural restraints of brute force; and conventional usage,&#xD;
society may lay behind to some extent, but its spon"&#xD;
taneous tendencies are to be in the aggregate What&#xD;
its members are in their individual Capacity. Thus&#xD;
it is that as man progresses he will form society. con-&#xD;
genial to his wants. And hence it is that one class&#xD;
of social reformers should not assume to -prescribe&#xD;
terms for another. Each class knows its own wants&#xD;

I am driven to the conclusion, that the race must be&#xD;
developed far beyond the grovelling pleasures of selfish&#xD;
acquisition and selfish possession,bdtore it can hope to&#xD;
realize the reign of love, and peace, and harmony.&#xD;
When such unjustifiable selfishness shall have become&#xD;
repulsive rather than otherwise, then will man enjoy&#xD;
a far greater sum of happiness, far purer and more&#xD;
exalted than now. His psychological state will be&#xD;
higher, and when society shall be adapted thereto,&#xD;

own all this property. The law  guarantees it to&#xD;
him, and when he consutts his own instinetsl he&#xD;

uld not have gone int-the wilderness amidst the&#xD;
haunisovfferocious beasts, and established there a home&#xD;
for himself and those who came after him. He would&#xD;
t have been fearful, weak, inefficient, and wholly' unfit&#xD;
for that adventure from which so much good has&#xD;
resulted to the race. But in this matter there has&#xD;
been no choice; the adventure is a necessity, and the&#xD;
good indespensable. External wilderness and war&#xD;
are phenomena which pertain to undeveloped nature.&#xD;
Mental rudeness and violence, in like manner per'&#xD;
tin to the undeveloped mind. The stage of pro&#xD;
gress in nature, corresponds to the stage of progress&#xD;
in man. The necessary violence-of the one calls into&#xD;
action the fitting violence of the other. But devei-&#xD;
opment in nature, as Geology and Astronomy prove,&#xD;
is mitigating the violence of action in the natural&#xD;
forces, and this, together with man's conquest of the&#xD;
earth, is mitigating the necessity for violence in hu-&#xD;
man action, Now, we can imagine of a time, end&#xD;
that time will most assuredly come, when there will&#xD;
be no call-for the violent exercise of this faculty, in&#xD;
the thousands of ways in which it is needed now.&#xD;
There are, indeed, at present, some conditions of life&#xD;
in which it. is not required, much, and I might say&#xD;
not any, and yet those who are placed in such con-&#xD;
ditions are indeed men as others and fullas happy as&#xD;
they. The faculty is almost latent, and its energies&#xD;
are of a quiet and subdued character. There being&#xD;
no occasion for the extreme phases of action, there is&#xD;
none; but the influence of the faculty is nevertheless&#xD;
felt, and that influence is .as legitimate when quiet&#xD;
and subdued as when more active and violent.&#xD;
"Now it seems to me that what is true of this&#xD;
tendency to violence, is equally true of the tendency&#xD;
to acquisition. The extreme or violent action-of the&#xD;
latter nowr pervades society, and the circumstances&#xD;
justify it, and even demand it to some extent, 'he&#xD;

justice. This. is the true extent and characterurider&#xD;
advanced conditions of individual acquisition, individe&#xD;

they are essentially individual, though social.&#xD;
"Under the existing Conditions of society the action&#xD;
of the property-getting faculty is necessarily, to a&#xD;
great extent, of-the more violent or selfishly isolated,&#xD;
character. Each must plan, labor, strive for his own&#xD;
exclusively selfish ends, not tvith his fellowsman, but&#xD;
against them. The circumstances are- imperious,&#xD;
and. inexorably demand the more violent -m nifesta-&#xD;

faculties which under other circumstances tend to&#xD;
destruction, will have all the occasions of a just and&#xD;
pleasurable exercise, and so will the faculty which now&#xD;
tends to selfish acquisition and possession. Those&#xD;
which lead to violence and bloodshed will be become&#xD;
enery and force of character,to be exercised in carry-&#xD;

leads to exclusive ownership will become a peaceful&#xD;
and. fraternal acquisition of the means of life.&#xD;
"I am aware that there is a philosophy, or what&#xD;
purports to be a science of mind, which asserts that&#xD;
there is a faculty of murder, and others of a similar-&#xD;
ly criminal character. Now, if this be true, and I&#xD;
o not pretend by any means to say that it is not,&#xD;
our reasoning is not in the least affected thereby.&#xD;
The extreme action of the faculty of 'destructive-&#xD;
ness' is murder ; the legitimate action of a certain&#xD;
faculty as defined by neurological science is murder,&#xD;
and the reasoning which applies to that, applies to&#xD;
this. Moreover, if we have a faculty, the normal&#xD;
exercise of which is the shedding of blood, then does&#xD;
it follow that to secure our greatest happiness, all&#xD;
our faculties need not be gratified, for no one would&#xD;
deny our being happier to suppress such use of the&#xD;
faculty than to indulge it. Now it is equally true,&#xD;
that if we have a faculty, the extreme or abnormal&#xD;
exercise of which is the shedding of- blood, it follows&#xD;
that to secure our greatest happiness, we need not&#xD;
provide for such exercise. The reasoning which ap-&#xD;
plies in the one case, applies in the other.&#xD;
" Grant that there are faculties, or the abnormal&#xD;
action of faculties, by the suppression of which, as in&#xD;
manslaughter, the true ends of happiness are sub-&#xD;
served ;..-grant the existence of such p class of facul-&#xD;
ties or species of action, then, if I can show that the&#xD;
&#xD;
faculty, or the abnormal action of a faculty, which&#xD;
leads  to, the extreme. ,of. exclusive acquisition and&#xD;
possession is referable to such class or speciesjI prove&#xD;
that the plan of society, which makes no provision&#xD;
for selfish= acquisition and ownership,. subserves, so&#xD;
far as this feature is concerned, the true eds .of&#xD;
human hapiness. If I cannot prove that excl-usjve-&#xD;
ness in property relations, like the taking -of.life,&#xD;
destractsfrom the sum of human happiness, I can at&#xD;
least establish-the presumption that such is the case ;&#xD;
and hence the presumption follows that the true&#xD;
conditions. of society would-not provide for exclusive.&#xD;
ness in property-getting and property-owning. Some&#xD;
of the considerations which bear upon this point have&#xD;
already appeared. These I shall briefly repeat, and&#xD;
present such others as seem to apply.-&#xD;
"I. ,The personal and. isolated acquisition- of&#xD;
wealth leads to a distribution in which those With&#xD;
the greatest wants nay have the scantiest means for&#xD;
their gratification, and vice versa.&#xD;
"2. When this propensity is indulged in an isolated&#xD;
capacity, men cannot be truly brethren. Neither&#xD;
the surface .of the earth, nor any source of natural&#xD;
wealth, is laid off by natural boundaries for isolated&#xD;
possession; nor is there any position for property.&#xD;
producing better adapted to one individual than to&#xD;
any one of thousands of others who are engaged in&#xD;
the same occupation; so that isolated :effort must&#xD;
result in strife, competition, antagonism, with a&#xD;
strong probability of the whole compound being&#xD;
tinctured with a large infusion of envy end bitterness.&#xD;
These two ingredients may be -generally concealed&#xD;
near the bottom  of, the vessel, and even there the&#xD;
practiced. eye may detect them; but then when they&#xD;
bubble to the surface, right in the broad daylight of&#xD;
the world,-as they often do, anybody can see- them.&#xD;
Such must be the  result of disconne4oJ and isola*&#xD;
tion where God designed association ahd fraternity.&#xD;

And this design, as an ultirnate, is manifest in the&#xD;
unitary character of 'man's dwelling-place, the ne-&#xD;
cessarily fraternal character of his pursuits, and the&#xD;
social character of his instincts.&#xD;
' 3. No one can suffer without others being af-&#xD;
fected more or less disagreeably ; and no one can&#xD;
be happy with legitimate fruition, without others&#xD;
being affected more or less agreeably. 1 The soli-&#xD;
darity of the race is an undeniable truth, and hence&#xD;
disconnection is practically impossible; and therefore&#xD;
the isolated and exclusive acquisition and possession&#xD;
of wealth is, with reference to higher conditions,&#xD;
unnatural, and so long as continued, under whatever&#xD;
form, must lead to absurd results, confusion, unhap-&#xD;
piness.&#xD;
" 4. In regard to this matter my own consciousness&#xD;
is sufficient for me. I feel out of place and unhappy&#xD;
in the disconnected exercise of the faculty in question,&#xD;
and although I desire to accumulate property, I can&#xD;
only enjoy doing it in a combined and fraternal effort&#xD;
with kindred spirits, or those to whom I am attached&#xD;
by the ties of love and friendship. I wish others to&#xD;
feel a personal and immediate interest in that to the&#xD;
production of which I contribute.  Hence it is very&#xD;
natural for me to refer selfish acquisition and the&#xD;
taking of- life, both to that class of faculties, the ex-&#xD;
ercise of which militates against human happiness.&#xD;
To all minds of my own class, the reasons which I&#xD;
have given will be satisfactory, but to others not.&#xD;
It is thus that what is truth to one mind is not truth&#xD;
to another. To one who accepts my formula of&#xD;
paramount justice, the consideration first given is&#xD;
conclusive; while another would shelter under some&#xD;
subterfuge to explain away the absurd distribution of&#xD;
wealth.&#xD;
" From the considerations now given at this inter-&#xD;
view, I conclude that it is not -necessary to tie hap-&#xD;

sequently that' isolated acquisition and possession&#xD;
will be utterly expunged from the advanced order of&#xD;

"I think your conclusion entirely . correct,'" ob-&#xD;

as you object to, is that which gives 'to the most of&#xD;
men   their seemingly chief enjoyments   Their&#xD;
thoughts, and reveries, and dreams, are .all about&#xD;
property-getting; and to urge your philosophy upon&#xD;
such in a practical way, would be to paralyze their&#xD;
energies and make them miserable."&#xD;
"Precisely so," responded the good friend; ",the&#xD;
love of gain seems to be their chief affection, just as&#xD;
with the wild Indian the love of the bloody adven-&#xD;

latter his bow and arrow, tomahawk and warclub,&#xD;
and you might as well tear out .his vitals, for you&#xD;

dreary, cold, and. comfortless as an Alpine glacier.&#xD;
He must have the spoils of war and of the chase;&#xD;
he loves the stirring adventure, and takes a savage&#xD;
delight in the infliction of blows, the flow of blood,&#xD;
and the writhing of his captured gate orvanquished&#xD;

is connected with the lower tendenciesrof our cokin&#xD;

as you have stated, and I have a short way with lii&#xD;

nature fits him; but if he should become developed&#xD;
above such a sordid condition of mind, then will he&#xD;
long for better conditions of society, and be pre-&#xD;
pared to enter them.&#xD;
"I insist that unfraternal acquisition and owner-&#xD;
ship, which arouse so much energy and give so much&#xD;
pleasure, are not attended with true happiness, any&#xD;
more than the mad ambition of Napoleon, or the un-&#xD;
hallowed lusts. of Aaron Burr, which aroused so much&#xD;
energy and gave so much guilty pleasure to them.&#xD;
We must not forget the pain in this reckoning; and&#xD;
there is pain as closely allied with the unbrotherly&#xD;
struggle for property as with the illicit struggle-for&#xD;
beauty or power."&#xD;
"But here is another trouble," observed Charles:&#xD;
" It is said that if men do not engage in production&#xD;
from selfish motives, they will not engage in it at all."&#xD;
"This," replied his friend, "is a libel upon 'human&#xD;
nature. I cannot permit any other person to answer&#xD;
in this matter for me, and further than that, I know&#xD;
that I have brethren."&#xD;
"And sisters too," added Charles.&#xD;
" Then," said the other, "I presume we need go&#xD;
no further to answer this objection, since each will&#xD;
refute it or confirm it for himself, out of the fullness&#xD;
or emptiness of his own heart."&#xD;
"Another objection," said Charles; " is, that to&#xD;
deny distinct acquisition and ownership, swamps the&#xD;
sovereignty of the individual."&#xD;
"Aye," replied' the other, " it does, if individual&#xD;
sovereignty have no higher meaning than the getting&#xD;
and owning of property according to the morbid&#xD;
cravings of a diseased instinct. But while I hold&#xD;
th t true individual sovereignty consists in the unlim-&#xD;

"and in doing so, will remember that under. the&#xD;
strictest rule in the highest dominion of truth, there&#xD;
ik the largest liberty."&#xD;
"Well said, Charles," responded his friend, "'and&#xD;

CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
DISPOSITION OF MEMBERS' CAPITAL.&#xD;
"An important consideration as to the best means&#xD;
of carrying into effect the highest humanitary law,&#xD;
has reference to the amount of capital which each&#xD;
shall have in the association. Shall it be a certain&#xD;
proportion of his means, as one-fourth, one-third,&#xD;
one-half, or any other aliquot part? or shall it be all?&#xD;
If we demand all the property of members, or any&#xD;
percentage, we proportion our demand somewhat in&#xD;
accordance with the ability of each to comply, and&#xD;
this is a consideration of some importance. But sup-&#xD;
pose that instead of either of these'conditions, which&#xD;
are substantially the same so far as the investment is&#xD;
concerned, we demand a stated sum, as, say one hun-&#xD;
dred dollars, or one thousand dollars, do we not vir-&#xD;
tually ask the rich man to do less than the poor man?&#xD;
Would this be right?&#xD;
"' All right,' I am told, 'because, since capital con-&#xD;
tributes to make labor in association more profitable,&#xD;
all should contribute equally, and then would all be&#xD;
benefited equally. The poor man, if he works as&#xD;
long as the rich one, gets just as much good of the&#xD;
capital, whatever sum be invested, as the owner him-&#xD;
self. He should, therefore, work more than present&#xD;
need demands, deposit his surplus gains, and thus con-&#xD;
tinue until he has as much invested as his wealthier&#xD;
brother. This may not be exact justice, since the&#xD;
poor man has been receiving benefits from the great-&#xD;
er amount of another's capital, and now his is only&#xD;
&#xD;
equal, so that he makes no return for past advantages,&#xD;
but he deserves this much favor, and we will accord&#xD;
it.&#xD;
" There is just one grand objection to the whole of&#xD;
this, and that is, that such an arrangement would re=&#xD;
cognize no higher principle than a phase of commer=&#xD;
cial justice, and that it would.carry it into relations&#xD;
whereit should not go,. And further, if we aim at&#xD;
this sort of justice in the case, we must demand that&#xD;
he who works longest per day shall have the great-&#xD;
est amount of stock in the business, or else we must&#xD;
give a share to capital; for it is' clear that when the&#xD;
hours of labor get all, he who counts the greatest&#xD;
number will get the largest benefit from the capital&#xD;
invested.&#xD;
" How does the. demand of a stated sum accord&#xD;
with the principle embodied, in the preamble; and&#xD;
which, I contend, should be the standard by which to&#xD;
make all adjustments of the kind?  Let us state a&#xD;
case.&#xD;
"A young man wishes to go into association, but&#xD;
has no funds.  He is admitted, however, and works&#xD;
five years with his mind as well as his body; for, 'be-&#xD;
ing intellectual, he wishes to develop the germ of his&#xD;
manhood and be true to his destiny.  At the end of&#xD;
the period he has accumulated five hundred dollars,&#xD;
obtained a good discipline of mind and a reasonable&#xD;
stock of knowledge.  But having been cooped up&#xD;
within the limits of an association,.it has been.impos-&#xD;
sible for him to learn some things,-,and obtain some&#xD;
mental discipline which he would deem desirable,&#xD;
and which can be had only in the wide world. In&#xD;
short he wants to travel.  He has five hundred dol.&#xD;
lars justly his, but that sum the. association demands&#xD;
as a permanent investment, and by necessity he must&#xD;
stay at home. Would that be justice? Would it not&#xD;
be crushing the noblest aspirations of our being-i-&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
,  t&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC7393-00000106"/>&#xD;
AND A    SR0ULD' BE .      211&#xD;
&#xD;
What young man, with a real soul in him, would not&#xD;
rather take his chances in the wide world than in&#xD;
such an organization ?&#xD;
"If I interpret it correctly, true justice requires&#xD;
that he be allowed to take the whole sum of five hun-&#xD;
dred dollars, if he desire it. His highest nature de-&#xD;
mands the right, and it would be unjust to defraud&#xD;
that nature of its dues. And the same principle de-&#xD;
mands that when he has earned five hundred dollars&#xD;
more and wants it for noble uses, he may take that&#xD;
also.&#xD;
As to whether the objects to which the money&#xD;
is appropriated be really good or not, this should be&#xD;
left for the individual himself to decide. But if his&#xD;
brethren should differ from him in this matter, and&#xD;
the breach become intolerable, the copartnership&#xD;
should be dissolved. The very fact of such a differ-&#xD;
ence would be the strongest evidence that the parties&#xD;
were antagonistic in thought and feeling, not adapted&#xD;
to each other, and that, therefore, the connection&#xD;
should be broken.&#xD;
" There is another consideration-one of an un-&#xD;
mixed moral character, and entitled to a hearing.&#xD;
There may be some in association who would find&#xD;
it difficult to obtain anything but what merely sus-&#xD;
tains them. These may have a nice sense of honor&#xD;
and keen sensibilities, and inasmuch as the organiza-&#xD;
tion which requires a stated sum, would in this par-&#xD;
ticular be based on the principle of commercial jus-&#xD;
tice, they would know it and feel it in every nerve,&#xD;
that the spirit of the association upbraids them with&#xD;
reaping benefits not justly theirs. And even ,if they&#xD;
were gradually depositing the amount required, still&#xD;
the feeling would haunt them till they had paid the&#xD;
last farthing. If I were without means, and especial-&#xD;
ly, if,' in addition, I had many small children to sup-&#xD;
port, I would not think of entering an institution or-&#xD;
&#xD;
gan1ed upon such priniples, and by necessity jos&#xD;
sessing a spirit in harmony with itsorganization-&#xD;
unless I could do no better elsewhere. I1 would be&#xD;
unhappy to breathe its atmosphere, and should only&#xD;
do so as the least. evil of many.  But recognize the&#xD;
highest form of justice, and then, if i should never&#xD;
get capital, I should not feel that the spirit of the in-&#xD;
stitution was reproaching me.&#xD;
"The requisition of a stated sum is, in my opinion,&#xD;
incompatible with the law of paramount justice, and&#xD;
should not be embodied in the rules and regulations&#xD;
of any social body;"&#xD;
Charles observed here, that "during the first year&#xD;
of an association it might not have achieved that de-&#xD;
gree of pecuniary success which would enable it to&#xD;
favor any-of its members with the personal-use of-all&#xD;
their earnings.. And besides this, every individual&#xD;
must have shelter, and tools moreover to work with.&#xD;
How would youmanage these things?" .&#xD;
"Well," replied his friend, "as to the tools,- that&#xD;
has already been settled. In making good, out of the&#xD;
general proceeds of each, year, the'wear and tear'&#xD;
of the machinery it uses, labor-furnishes its own imn&#xD;
plements and  mechanical forces.  This. is"clear&#xD;
enough, since by the time the machinery and tools&#xD;
are all worn out, the capital invested therein is alltre-&#xD;
placed.&#xD;
"As to the 'obligations for shelter; there has been&#xD;
nothing said. The unmarried man or woman who&#xD;
rooms with a family is one of its members, and so far&#xD;
as house rent is concerned none could be demanded.&#xD;
But with the family which requires a separate house&#xD;
or part of a house, the case would be different. If it&#xD;
occupy the building twenty -years, the roof would&#xD;
have to be renewed and other repairing done-&#xD;
Rooms and buildings used for general purposes, all&#xD;
would have ar interest in, and might be co %Midered&#xD;

serve the capital invested.in the edifices intact, and&#xD;
it might be proper to go this far, but anything fur-&#xD;
ther I should not be willing to adopt as a permanent&#xD;
measure.&#xD;
" In an association having limited means, as per-&#xD;
haps all must have at first, it might be considered ex-&#xD;
pedient to require of each family, besides the-yearly&#xD;
rent already stated, an additional sum equal to one&#xD;
tenth of the first cost of the room or building which&#xD;
it occupies. This rent would of course continue but&#xD;
ten years, for in that time each family would have a&#xD;
share in -the general stock, equal to the cost of its own&#xD;
apartments. The occasion for the demand having&#xD;
passed away, the annuity would cease.&#xD;
" But this is a provision for which I have no fan-&#xD;
cy, and could tolerate it only as a necessity. I should&#xD;
prefer to trust this matter to the generosity. of mem-&#xD;
bers. None should enter association but those who&#xD;
know each other well, and under circumstances at&#xD;
least which involve no considerable risk; it would be&#xD;
but natural that such repose a generous and fraternal&#xD;
confidence in each other. In my own case I should&#xD;
prefer to have this matter left to myself. The con-&#xD;
ditions then would be such that I could'show myself&#xD;
generous enough to do my part according to the ex.&#xD;
tent of my abilities; and then, if I were not able to&#xD;
furnish as much as a provision of this kind might re-&#xD;
quire, I should not feel reproached. But if the con-&#xD;
s ' ution demand it, I would have no choice in the&#xD;
er, and could not prove myself worthy. I attach&#xD;
much importance to these considerations.&#xD;
" If'any one should gain admission, so small in soul&#xD;
as to come a voluntary charge to the -institution,&#xD;

when its meahs would not justify such an outlay, oir&#xD;
at any time, without the assurance of worth and pro.&#xD;
mise in the recipient; the association would have a&#xD;
remedy ;-it could expel the delinquent. , Such a&#xD;
remedy would be efficient, and since the member&#xD;
would have no invested funds it would be easily ap-&#xD;
plied. In view of ,such a remedy there could be no&#xD;
risk, and hence the provision under consideration&#xD;
would not be a necessity.&#xD;
The doctrines- of the Fourier school require that&#xD;
all should be maintained, whether they work or not.&#xD;
This would doubtless be right, for as it has been said,&#xD;
and truly, none but idiotic persons would accept of&#xD;
such a gratuity ;--the sociability- and attractiveness&#xD;
of labor would be such that all would do their part.&#xD;
But the maintainance of persons of this kind could&#xD;
only be guaranteed in such establishments as -may&#xD;
have become wealthy'enough to'take a practical stand&#xD;
upon higher principles.&#xD;
Expulsion for slothfulness would in all probability&#xD;
never have to be resorted to, as previous acqtaintance&#xD;
would be a sufficient guarantee against -deception in&#xD;
the character-of the individual, but-if it should become&#xD;
necessary, the protection it affords would be efficient;&#xD;
and hence I, should object to the adoption at'.any&#xD;
time of such a measure as the one under cbntempla4&#xD;
tion.  But if adopted as a protection to the infancy&#xD;
of the enterprise, I should be entirely opposed to its&#xD;
continuance after the association should hate pro.&#xD;
cured ample means and became-able tolive up ruoe&#xD;
closely to the requisitions of true justice.-And fs to&#xD;
demanding-more than this of moneyless persons as a&#xD;

cuniary success, it should nevertheless aim, at thenre-&#xD;
alization of true justice as an ultimate, and approach&#xD;
it practically as fast as its available means enable it&#xD;
to do so.&#xD;
"In proceeding with the business of this interview,&#xD;
I may ask: What would be the practical result, if we&#xD;
demand a certain percentage of capital as a perma-&#xD;
nent investment in the association, and permit mem-&#xD;
bers to do what they please with the rest?  So far&#xD;
as the demand of an aliquot part of the capital of&#xD;
each is concerned, I see no error abstract or practi-&#xD;
cal, but I certainly do see an error in the permission.&#xD;
" It is true that we cannot deny to the individual&#xD;
the privilege of such use of his own funds as he may&#xD;
wish for the gratification of his own personal tastes.&#xD;
If we deny this privilege, we blot out the individual&#xD;
so far as he is an individual distinct from all others.&#xD;
Now, since this life owes a great share of its loveli-&#xD;
ness and attraction to personal diversity, an associa-&#xD;
tion must not deny it to the individual, for the same&#xD;
diversiy has its charms and uses there. But this&#xD;
privilege to obey the behests of the inner man rests&#xD;
upon higher grounds than these:-It is a right, and&#xD;
must be respected.&#xD;
"Let it be understood at the outset, that there is a&#xD;
great difference between the right of the individual&#xD;
to use or expend property for the legitimate gratifi-&#xD;
cation of his own peculiar tastes, and the privilege of&#xD;
the individual to control his uninvested funds with a&#xD;
view to pecuniary profit. The former is consistent&#xD;
with association and the true interests of all; the lat-&#xD;
ter may pr may not be, depending entirely upon the&#xD;
latitudelaimed for the privilege. It is with this we&#xD;
have now to do.&#xD;
" If the individual be allowed to control a certain&#xD;
portion of his own funds, say the one half, what shall&#xD;
bp the limit of that control ?  If he wish to sppcu*&#xD;

late for his own benefit, shall he be allowed the privi-&#xD;
lege?  I should answer, decidedly, no.  He might&#xD;
fail in his adventures, and would thus injure the as-&#xD;
sociation itself.- But, if successful, how then?&#xD;
"Speculation does not come within-the range of&#xD;
the social design, and his brethren remonstrate. ,ie&#xD;
answers, that wishing to do as much good as possible,&#xD;
he can only gratify his benevolence to the full extent&#xD;
by getting more abundant means, and that when his&#xD;
speculation has brought him a handsome return, he&#xD;
will close it up, and use his means for the general&#xD;
good.  That adventure turns out well,,and he sees&#xD;
other good chances. Having a better eye for specu-&#xD;
lations than 'good works,' he ventures again.  The&#xD;
association interferes, but he meets his censors with&#xD;
a ready excuse, and begs a little longer indulgence.&#xD;
What's to be done?. His soul becomes absorbed in&#xD;
his own business, and he cares nothing for the assn.&#xD;
ciation, except as far as it enables him to save more&#xD;
money than he otherwise could. Is such an individ.&#xD;
ual a true social brother for those who are devoted&#xD;
to the interests of the association and. the promotion&#xD;
of its grand objects? Their sympathies are with&#xD;
truth and humanity, and their treasures are used ac-&#xD;
cordingly. His sympathies are in his -own pockets,&#xD;
and there are his most beloved treasures.  There is&#xD;
no high order of sympathy between them, and any&#xD;
association which tolerates selfish speculation, or any&#xD;
unfraternal use of capital in its members, is, in ' sure&#xD;
way to defeat the best purposes for which association&#xD;
may be formed. Not one alone, but many might set&#xD;
up on their own account, and carry emulation into&#xD;
the mania itself of speculation, and then,wo to ale&#xD;
that is good and true in socialism !&#xD;
But could w.e not easily prevent mischief of this&#xD;
kind? If the association has one half of, his original&#xD;
capital, let it pow nea 4 ,e. half ,of kis gaus ;&#xD;

permanent stock. Even upon this plan the associa'&#xD;
tion would recognize the individual's permanent right&#xD;
to all he can make by speculation, and in taking one-&#xD;
half it would only deprive him of the benefit of that&#xD;
much in trade; so that he is still interested in carry-&#xD;
ing on his schemes of self.agrandizement, to the det-&#xD;
riment of true fraternity, his own good, and the well-&#xD;

"'fo secure to the individual that true liberty which&#xD;
is consistent with his highest happiness, and to guard&#xD;
against those abuses in the name of liberty, which&#xD;
are at once a sin against himself and his fellow-man,&#xD;
I would suggest the following provisions:&#xD;
" 1. If the association require it for business uses,&#xD;
let every member be obliged, by the constitution, to&#xD;
bring in all his capital. 2. If it be not all needed,&#xD;
let a certain proportion be given up, and in this re-&#xD;
spect, place all upon the same footing, no one being&#xD;
compelled to give a larger percentage of his capital&#xD;
than another. 3. But in order to preserve to the in.&#xD;
dividual the privilege of satisfying his own tastes, in&#xD;
accordance with the spirit of the institution, let him&#xD;
retain whatever sum he wants for immediate use.&#xD;
4. And, moreover, even after he has deposited all his&#xD;
capital, he should be allowed to call out at any time,&#xD;
for the same purpose of individual gratification, a&#xD;
sum not exceeding one-tenth per annum of all his&#xD;
capital. And:when all his funds are not invested, if&#xD;
he and the association, the parties in this matter, re-&#xD;
quire it, he shall so draw upon his means both within&#xD;
and without the- institution, so as to retain the pro-&#xD;
portion which the present policy requires, and not&#xD;
destroy the equality in this respect, between other&#xD;
members and himself.&#xD;

gain, to undertake the management himself. As to&#xD;
pecuniary advantages, it would be. all one 'to him&#xD;
whether his property be in association or out, partly&#xD;
or wholly, and doubtless the most of members would&#xD;
prefer to have all their means in the business proper&#xD;
of the association. If, however, any one take pleas-&#xD;
ure in managing a part of his property, in the true&#xD;
spirit of a son or daughter of humanity, for the good&#xD;
of all, he should be allowed to do so. I would go&#xD;
even further;-if the immediate business dispenses&#xD;
with a part of the funds of members, and there be&#xD;
some who prefer to take their capital into association,&#xD;
and submit the business management of it to the estab-&#xD;
lishment, and others who should prefer to retain the&#xD;
business control of theirs for the common good, in the&#xD;
tranner'already mentioned, each class should be al-&#xD;
lowed the gratification of its peculiar tastes. All the&#xD;
difference which could result to individuals from such&#xD;
an arrangement, would be, that some indulge busi-&#xD;
ness propensities, and others avoid business cares.&#xD;
As to pecuniary emoluments, all would stand upon the&#xD;
sane footing, whether all'the-capital be in the imme-&#xD;
diate business of the association, a certain percentage&#xD;
. of that belonging'to each, or a larger proportion of&#xD;
one member's capital than of another's. The equality&#xD;
is secured by the equitable distribution of the proceeds&#xD;
of all grades of property, and, while it is maintained,&#xD;
no mischief can be done; by granting to the indivi-&#xD;
dual the privilege of managing his own property af-&#xD;
fairs, in the why already pointed out.&#xD;
" If the capital is not needed for the business of the&#xD;
association, several may-combine their surplus means,&#xD;
and place it under 'the control -of' a brother who&#xD;
tmiht be disposed to undertake its management for&#xD;
the ' ood of 'all. -&#xD;
"tI might here observe, Charles that in this discus-&#xD;
stonJhav4 4ken of property ts ingested"'and&#xD;
unifested,' while in fact, under the arrangement&#xD;
&#xD;
proposed, all property i  invested in the association,&#xD;
though some of it might not be in its immediate busi-&#xD;
ness. The terms, though not strictly correct, I have&#xD;
used, for the sake of brevity, presuming that there&#xD;
would be no misapprehension."&#xD;
" There has been none," said Charles.&#xD;
The good brother, resuming, said: "The business&#xD;
management of my own property affairs is really re-&#xD;
pulsive to me, so that it can readily be imagined to&#xD;
what class I would belong. My property would be&#xD;
in the association for the good of every otherone, as&#xD;
well as of myself, and no one could envy me what lit-&#xD;
tle I possess. Another does not invest his in the im-&#xD;
mediate business- of the association, but contibls it&#xD;
for the good of others as well as of himself, and no&#xD;
one could envy him. He is getting good of mine and&#xD;
I of his, and we are brothers. I gratify my taste .in&#xD;
giving up the business control of my property, and&#xD;
he in retaining the business control of his, but still&#xD;
we are brothers.&#xD;
"Suppose, on the other hand, that he is permitted&#xD;
to manage his property for his own selfish benefit.&#xD;
We may have equal portions in association, it mat-&#xD;
ters not; .he is. elsewhere pursuing a selfish end, an&#xD;
end in which I am:his enemy, in which all men are&#xD;
by necessity his enemies-I see it, and deplore, with&#xD;
the deepest energies of my nature, the perversions&#xD;
of a soul like his--and we are no lo. ger truly&#xD;
brethren."&#xD;
Charles interposed with -the remark, that." surely&#xD;
no one with any thought of trying. to realize the&#xD;
practical truth of association would pretend toclaim&#xD;
the privilege. of procuring gain in any way with ,a&#xD;
view to exclusive possession"&#xD;

iens are apt to be such as are weary of the multi-&#xD;
plied business cares and distractions of isolation, and&#xD;
if they are attracted to business, I. should suppose&#xD;
they would prefer a management in the association."&#xD;
" You may be entirely right, Charles," was the re-&#xD;
sponse, "but. we cannot judge of others' peculiarities&#xD;
by our own ; and it is well enough, in an investiga-&#xD;
tien -ike this,.to ascertains as far as possible, the latW-&#xD;
tude which may be safely given in the policy of trans-&#xD;
ition. It ia most likely that in any enterprise of the&#xD;
kindj'allthe funds of members will be needed as fast&#xD;
as they cia' be made available, so that business capa..&#xD;
cities woki find their appropriate sphere in, managmg&#xD;

Charles remarked again: " You. allow of the grati..&#xD;
fluation of individual 'tastes, and would permit mem-&#xD;
bers to draw out funds, and appropriate therr for&#xD;
such a purpose; now, why not allow-the gratification&#xD;
of individual tastes in the matter of speculatingor&#xD;
managing property for one's own benefit? :Some&#xD;
would -seek to know why you permit the one and&#xD;
forbid the other."&#xD;
"I would answer- thus: Association is set on foot&#xD;
for a certain purpose. That purpose is the realiza-&#xD;
tion of fraternity for the highest good of all, individu.&#xD;
ally and collectively. If a member wish to qualify&#xD;
himself for service to truth and humanity, to instruct&#xD;
and amuse himself by travel, to relieve the criminal&#xD;
and insane, to reclaim the inebriate, to- promote edu-&#xD;
cational reform, to assist the. oppressed, to help needy&#xD;
but worthy friends, or in any way contribute. to the&#xD;

continued Charles, "it is that to take away the priv-&#xD;
lege of pursuing the crooked by-ways of self-emolu-&#xD;
ment, would be to invade the very sanctum sanc-&#xD;
torum of individual liberty, and tear away the shrine&#xD;
to hide it under the bog and fog of socialism-"&#xD;
"1 I am at no pains," replied the other, "to con-&#xD;
coct a system of reorganization that will suit such as&#xD;
you speak of. Those who set a value on the priv-&#xD;
ileges of the jockey, or, which is the same thing, make&#xD;
exclusive self the great end of life-long endeavor,&#xD;
cannot prize the loftier purposes of their being, and&#xD;
for such, socialism is not. They must rise through a&#xD;
rudimental education into the regions of a more ad-&#xD;
vanced development, and then will the good dame&#xD;
socialism take them by the hand and lead them&#xD;
higher.. Men and women, true to their destiny, will&#xD;
enter such an organization as I propose, and it is&#xD;
such we want. Those who do not feel the want of&#xD;

better conditions, even if provided. They cannot,&#xD;
indeed. There is a necessity .in the case. As some&#xD;
of odr preachers tell us, Satan, a Universalist, or a&#xD;
bad man could not enjoy heaven if permitted to enter.&#xD;
Now there is a great deal of philosophy in this not&#xD;
so generally understood, however well it may be felt.&#xD;
The conditions of congeniality and sympathy must&#xD;
exist or there is no bond of union.&#xD;
"We provide for the gratification of individual&#xD;

a just individual liberty. It does not lay down a&#xD;
specific character for personal taste, but a general&#xD;

the expression of the convictions of the whole social&#xD;
body, and: by enforcing it the-kindred will be at--&#xD;
tracted, and the antagonistic expelled. Such a result&#xD;
is essential to the highest success of an association.&#xD;
As soon as it- undertakes to reconcile conflicting&#xD;
tastes and interests, it abandons the high ground of&#xD;
principle, and endangers its success. Compromise&#xD;
may answer in politics, but it will not do in socialism.&#xD;
" Conflicting interests may be held together in&#xD;
political governments, by. the power of a strong ex-&#xD;
ecutive. Owing to the false conditions of society&#xD;
there is such a complication and antagonism of-inter.&#xD;
ests in every political organization, that without 'the&#xD;
central force acting upon the union, it wouldsoon be&#xD;
shattered to pieces. An efficient executive, is, in all&#xD;
existing governments, a necessary tyranny.  The&#xD;
more antagonism of :interest any nation is cursed&#xD;
with, the more tyranny will be necessary to enforce&#xD;
the compromises. Let us, therefore, have no anng-&#xD;

An association embodying harmonic elements only,&#xD;
will need no central Gower of an arbitrary character&#xD;
to bind it together. The integrity -of the union will&#xD;

"If perso wishing to enter association are so en-&#xD;

objectionable, they have the wide world, to seek con.&#xD;
geniality in. If those commercial combinatidars&#xD;
which have money-getting for their exclusive object,&#xD;
do not meet their -ideas' of association, they must&#xD;
originate such forms as correspond to their conscious&#xD;
needs. Let each class be at liberty, so-far as the&#xD;
necessities permit, to project the external froth the&#xD;
internal, the actual from the ideal, and the true&#xD;
manhood, with its corresponding form, will develop&#xD;
gradually into larger and more beautiful proportions.&#xD;
" But why should any one object to the arrange-&#xD;
ments proposed? Either the objector has doubts&#xD;
about the safety of the investment, or else he is too&#xD;
selfish to share with others. If he doubt the securi-&#xD;
ty of the investment, he either lacks confidence in&#xD;
the integrity and wisdom of the association to exe-&#xD;
cute its business with honesty and success, or else&#xD;
has apprehensions with respect to the validity of&#xD;
titles to property in such an institution. If he can-&#xD;
not satisfy his mind on these points, he cannot be&#xD;
at ease, nor enter. into unreserved fellowship with&#xD;
his brethren. and should not unite himself wi~h them.&#xD;
If he is too selfsh to share all his incomes with others&#xD;
upon the same conditions that tiey share with him,&#xD;
he would not be fit to be their brother, and should&#xD;
not expect such a recognition.&#xD;

promise redeemed ?1If the members have- capital&#xD;
enough, there can be no deficiency. It is all brought&#xD;
i and retained in.  There is no capital used for&#xD;
purposes which do not come within the range of the&#xD;
social design. One member cannot take improper&#xD;
advantages of others ; the disinterested will be se-&#xD;
cure from the wiles of the selfish ;-the circumstances&#xD;
will be adjusted upon terms of unexceptionable&#xD;
equity ; arid absolute truth, with respect to dividend&#xD;
on stock, would become practical right. None with&#xD;
capital would enter association but the true; all&#xD;
would be treated as nearly just as practicable; dis-&#xD;
cord and selfishness would remain undeveloped, and&#xD;
success in all'that is noble would crown the effort.&#xD;
"Hence it is manifest that one' provision of a&#xD;
social, constitution will depend on another, and that&#xD;
no dividend to capital, though one thing to be attained,&#xD;
is not the only one. The refusal of dividend, as we&#xD;
have seen, involves much practical difficulty, but&#xD;
this may be met in other' provisions, and the policy&#xD;
made consistent and harmonious. If the avenues to&#xD;
speculation are closed up and the property of all&#xD;
placed' in relations of perfect equality, then there&#xD;
would be no call whatever for any consideration to&#xD;
capital.  On the one hand, if speculation is not&#xD;
vented, a complication of vicious circumstances&#xD;
renders absolute truth in respect to dividend-on stock&#xD;
6 practical falsehood; while on the other, if it is pre-&#xD;
prevented, just, natural, and fraternal adjustment of&#xD;
conditions'brings the same absolute truth within the&#xD;
range of a beautiful and consistent realization."&#xD;
"I understand 'you," said Charles, "and should&#xD;
think that the sane holds true of the principle of&#xD;

sary defects in one quarter may be supplied by&#xD;
practicable remedies in another; and that although&#xD;
science is not practicable et the present juncture, a&#xD;
good and efficient transition policymay be."&#xD;
"We see eye to eye," replied the good brother,&#xD;
"and God bethanked for. that."&#xD;
"I know another," said Charles, "who&#xD;

answered the good man, " who are in the same ideal&#xD;

"Would to. Heaven that ideal were actualized,"&#xD;
responded Charles, earnestly.&#xD;
"lleaven -has vouchsafed the boon, my brother;&#xD;
but the work as well as the fruition is ours. Let us&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
VARIOUS DETAILS OF TRANSITION POWOY.&#xD;
"The preamble of a social constitution such as I&#xD;
would form, has already been given.  Some of the&#xD;
measures of a transition policy have been discussed,&#xD;
and now we will attend to some additional matters,&#xD;
not of less importance to an enterprise-of the kind,&#xD;
but so connected with what has gone -before, or of&#xD;
such A character that they may be 'briefly disposed of.&#xD;
"1According to Warren's system, men, women and&#xD;
children are rewarded for their labor upon the -same&#xD;
principle ; 'that of repugnance overcome. There is&#xD;
much justnessin the practical equality thus established&#xD;
between these three classes ; though children who&#xD;
have just begun to labor do not require -as much for&#xD;
their needs as older persons. There should be little&#xD;
done in the book education of the young till they ap-&#xD;
proach their 'teens.' Until this time, and indeed for&#xD;
years after, the main object should be to:perfect the&#xD;
physical constitution, and develop the mental energies&#xD;
by other means than close application to books.-&#xD;
But, further, under our plan, education is guaranteed,&#xD;
and I should, therefore, make a dividing point at the&#xD;
age of fifteen or sixteen years. All above this age,&#xD;
male and female, I would remunerate equally, accord-&#xD;
ing to the time spent in labor. In the case of young-&#xD;
er persons, I would grade the remuneration accord-&#xD;
ing to age as well as time.&#xD;
Those engaged in teaching and nursing should receive&#xD;
pay as other laborers. This would make the educa-&#xD;
tion of the youth, and the care of infancy, so far as&#xD;
&#xD;
carried onin- the s..,gi oom:and nurse ,the .bsi-&#xD;
ness-of then ttutionjnd in this way would theybe&#xD;
guaranteed.  Countingthe industrial hours' ofIthe&#xD;

bring their Gallowance out of ategnat  iedag&#xD;
Productive industry would thus guaranteehe gen.zzal&#xD;
education of youth and thecooperative Attaienst&#xD;

Besides these we,honld guarantee-the mesns ad&#xD;
appurtenances, Qf mentl improvement ;and also re.&#xD;
lief for. person  asualties, sikeess;infirmity, old&#xD;
age and the like. Labor gets-he 'us:o f all; the cap-&#xD;
ital, and I wouldtke these guarantees .ut of the net&#xD;
yearly ineome, before distributing it 4n the manner&#xD;
already prescribed. ' A yearly allowance of not less&#xD;

SOCIETY AS IT IS&#xD;
&#xD;
brotherhood: and the repetition of the trials will&#xD;
guard against permanent results to any one from has-&#xD;
ty and ill-considered action.&#xD;
It would be impossible for all members, when wish-&#xD;
ing to enter an association, to be able to realize the&#xD;
ready money for their real estate, and hence it would&#xD;
be appraised at its cash value at the-time of their be-&#xD;
coming members, and the proceeds would be divided&#xD;
to labor-time as already specified. But upon selling&#xD;
this property, if it had gained in value, there would be&#xD;
an excess over and above the appraisement, of which&#xD;
no account should be made upon investing it in the&#xD;
business of the community ; for like the increase of&#xD;
value on the estate within, it would be common pro-&#xD;
perty, subject to an equal distribution to all the in-&#xD;
mates, and should remain as a permanent investment,&#xD;
contributing thus to the general prosperity.' Loss in&#xD;
such a case would be offset by the i crease of value&#xD;
on property invested. Losses by winds, foods, fire, or&#xD;
other casualties upon any property belonging to the as-&#xD;
sociation, would be met in the same way. This would&#xD;
be the working of the system until the loss should&#xD;
overbalance all previous gains, and then the original&#xD;
capital would be diminished and of course have to suf-&#xD;
fer the loss, in case any distribution of the same&#xD;
should be made to members.&#xD;
Since no one would have an interest in the increase&#xD;
of value, but for the period of his membership, there&#xD;
should be a yearly valuation of the real estate, so that&#xD;
If it should come to the dividing of such increase, the&#xD;
share of each may be known.&#xD;
Those who are ejected from the association, or&#xD;
who voluntarily leave it to return to isolation, should&#xD;
forfeit their right to any share in the increase of&#xD;
value.&#xD;
Upon the decease of any inmate, his share of such&#xD;
increase will, of course, fall to the generalinheritance&#xD;

es for maintainance, or to supply the place of any&#xD;
investment required of members.&#xD;
Any one who wishes to withdraw should be per-&#xD;
mitted to do so. Retiring members, whether expelled&#xD;
or leaving voluntarily, should receive, during the next&#xD;
ten years, all their stock in equal annual payments&#xD;
without interest.&#xD;
All who have mor? than one-hundred dollars to in-&#xD;
vest, should, upon entering the brotherhood, make a&#xD;
will regulating the descent of. such propertyasthey&#xD;
now own, together with all that may hereafter come&#xD;
into their hands as subject to their disposal by the&#xD;
terms of the compact. This 'will' should be approv.&#xD;
ed of by the appointed authority, before such individ-&#xD;
ual be admitted into full membership. And any one&#xD;
admitted with less than one hundred dollars, who&#xD;
shall afterwards obtainn the amount, and also any&#xD;
member coming of age by the laws of the state, .and&#xD;
having property at"his, disposal, should in like, man-&#xD;

to do so. This may .be a necessary, but easy and can-&#xD;

employment, and make such an adjustment of the&#xD;
industrial operations as will secure harmony and co-&#xD;
operation in the various branches. To this end he&#xD;
would have to consult general meetings, other offi-&#xD;

that pertains to mental training, whether of old or&#xD;

This trust should be so arranged according to the-ex-&#xD;

to give perfect security and satisfaction to all.&#xD;

" Those present at any meeting should be a quo-&#xD;

should prevent the attendance of one third of the&#xD;
members. A majority of all the members should be&#xD;
necessary to make any change in the constitution.&#xD;
"No mem6er should ever indulge in private elec-&#xD;
tioneering, or resort to any indirect method of affect-&#xD;
ing the election or defeat of any one, or of securing&#xD;
the adoption or repeal of any measure whatever.&#xD;
Such things should be done openly, directly, fairly.&#xD;
When voting is done by ballot, each voter should&#xD;
write his or her name on the back of the ticket in&#xD;
such a way that the judges may see whose it is be-&#xD;
fore depositing it in the ballot-box. This would tend&#xD;
to guard against scheming, -underhanded processes,&#xD;
and promote independence and self-reliance; while&#xD;
the advantages of concealing the result, as the voting&#xD;
proceeds, would still be retained by the folded bal-&#xD;
lot.&#xD;
"1Charles, if you are not getting weary of details, I&#xD;
am. I shall only say in addition, that, as a matter of&#xD;
course, the association would purchase a tract. of&#xD;
land, locate thereon, and develop its resources; that&#xD;
as soon as the finances warrant it, there should be a&#xD;
phalanstery or phalansteries erected for the domestic&#xD;
accommodation of all as a true brotherhood; that&#xD;
each family should have its separate apartment or&#xD;
apartments, but that all should, as a general thing,&#xD;
eat at the same table ; that an association should,&#xD;
as far as practicable, directly supply its own wants&#xD;
with its own productions; that purchases of clothing,&#xD;
groceries, &amp;amp;c., should be made at wholesale, and&#xD;
members charged no more than cost; that the use of&#xD;
tea, coffee, tobacco, drugs and animal food, especially&#xD;
swine's flesh, should be discouraged; and lastly, that&#xD;
&#xD;
all intoxicating beverages should be exci4ed. from&#xD;
the premises by an Mialterable decree.&#xD;
"It is needless to go further with thesepractical&#xD;
matters. The object of an investigation like' ours,&#xD;
should be a- definitive settlerhent of cardinal prin i-&#xD;
pies, and this in our humble but earnest-way we have&#xD;
tried to do.  It is general rules only,, in aecordie&#xD;
with fundamentaI principles, that The organic law of&#xD;
a transitional community can establish. The details&#xD;
must be reserved for by-laws. Much as to the minu-&#xD;
tim of business matters will have to bedlearned by ac-&#xD;
tual. trial.  Each will live and labor for all, and -all&#xD;
for each, and they will adopt practical details from the&#xD;
wants and experiences of one another. For this rea-&#xD;
son and others,-those who unite in an effortof the&#xD;
kind should be in-spirit a true. fraternity. 'Then, with&#xD;
a full understanding of primary' principles,, and the&#xD;
satisfactory adjustment of the question of labor and&#xD;
capital, there will be no danger ofa rupture. Order&#xD;
will be brought out of chaos, harmony out of discord,&#xD;
peace out of var,' happiness out of misery; love will&#xD;
pervade, and wisdom direct the creative effort.&#xD;
"I repeat, that those who associate must be one' in&#xD;
spirit, and to this end' they must-know each' other&#xD;
well. But I am told that "we may live for years with&#xD;
some persons and know but little about them. They&#xD;
are actors in the drama of life,-do not show their real&#xD;
character, 'and you cannot detect it."  There might&#xD;
be cases of this kind, I admit, but they would be rare.&#xD;
And then, in such, we would'be pretty certain to feel&#xD;
that there was something which we could not rightly&#xD;
understand, and this- vould- be an omen 'of evil.---&#xD;
When an. individual is single-minded and whole-soul-&#xD;

school of Fourier has erred in the same way. We&#xD;
have put in our disclaimer against such a mode of&#xD;
proceeding, and as for myself I shall never expend&#xD;
endeavors of my own upon an enterprize of the kind.&#xD;

feels the tortures of the social hell which rages around&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
FLAGELLATIONS.       -&#xD;
After the close of these interviews, Charles was&#xD;
anxious, as might be supposed, to see his sister Mary,&#xD;
and accordingly, unless than a week, he started on a&#xD;
visit to the Union School. He found Mary pleasantly&#xD;
enough engaged, and happy in the consciousness of&#xD;
doing good. Charles had a copy of all that-had been&#xD;
said and written at the different interviews, and this&#xD;
he gave to Mary, with a history of all that had hap-&#xD;
pend. le gave a description of the unknown visitor,&#xD;
and at this Mary-betrayed some nervous agitation,&#xD;
and a blush came to her cheek. Innocence is never&#xD;
too pureto be modest, and whilst it is inevitably al-&#xD;
lied with the grosser necessities of a rudimental ex-&#xD;
istence. like ours, it must ever blush. Mary knew&#xD;
full as much of the stranger as Charles did, and, in&#xD;
fact, rather more. Visions of what would be, had&#xD;
passed before her, and Mary's visions always have a&#xD;
meaning. And I should have said, though the reader&#xD;
may hardly think it credible, that the unknown teach-&#xD;
er was only a year or two older than Charles.&#xD;
Having impressed Mary to consider well the social&#xD;
doctrines and the plan for social elevation which&#xD;
they accompanied, Charles, after a stay of two or&#xD;
three days returned to his little home in the country,&#xD;
to await the coming of Mary at the close of the&#xD;
term.&#xD;
Accordingly she came-a day sooner, however,&#xD;
&#xD;
,y 1&#xD;
{&#xD;

- L&#xD;
x&#xD;
h&#xD;
&#xD;
than Charles expected and he was away from home.&#xD;
But Mary was entertained, nevertheless, The, old&#xD;
lady who lived in Charles' cottage and did all 'the&#xD;
cooking and housekeeping for her husband, family,&#xD;
And Charles, had wonderful:stories to tell of what&#xD;
had been going on in that very house only a month&#xD;
or two before.&#xD;
The tenant on Charles' farm was a very good sort&#xD;
of man., One great virtue of his was, that he mind-&#xD;
ed his own business and let other people's alone.&#xD;
Another genial feature of his character was, that&#xD;
what he did not understand he was not-disposed to&#xD;
judge uncharitably ;. so that there were many, things&#xD;
not :accounted for in his philosophy, which he did&#xD;
not, like the most of his neighbors, consider neoes-&#xD;
sarily bad. He was not a, member of any Church,&#xD;
but largely gifted, nevertheless, with what might be&#xD;
called Christian charity. So far as he had mental&#xD;
development, he was, as I said, about the right sort&#xD;
of man.&#xD;
His 'wife, however, was different. She had an&#xD;
abundance of what was technically called "grace,"&#xD;
and this gave her a degree of-pragmatical latitude,&#xD;
commensurate with her vast abilities for anything like&#xD;
attending to other people's'business and keeping them&#xD;
just where they ought to be. -She knew what was&#xD;
exactly right in all things, from the make of a ser-&#xD;
mon and the cut of a: dress, down to all the un-&#xD;
mentionable minutit of -walking into church or eating&#xD;
a' dinner.' She was always posted up in the affairs of&#xD;
her neighborhood, and had a special nich:in the tern-&#xD;
ple of, standard respectability for every one she' lnew,&#xD;
and could tell, on a very short acquaintances just&#xD;
where to place anybody. She also entered intoan&#xD;
elaborate and -detailed investigation of such matters&#xD;
as -the settlement of .estates, the miunderstanding&#xD;
between old Mr. Crusty and his neighbor Hobbins,&#xD;

&#xD;
the ailments of Mrs. Fretful, determining, with much&#xD;
care and precision, the exact location of .the pains&#xD;
and aches, the squabbles between Mr. Swigson and his&#xD;
wife, the last wedding and the next one,,the naming&#xD;
of everybody's baby, and all the important gossip of&#xD;
the town-ship-world she lived in. She., prided, her-&#xD;
self on the variety of subjects she could handle with&#xD;
ability, and if the question at issue had two sides or&#xD;
more, she invariably took one, and pronounced her&#xD;
decision with much emphasis. It. is oddthat such a&#xD;
personage should be the wife of a renter, but -such&#xD;
things happen sometimes. Her parents were wealthy,&#xD;
and she was sure that she had a 'high spirit of her&#xD;
own; but not content with knowing it herself, she&#xD;
made it a point to convince others that although her&#xD;
husband was a poor man, he had a wife that ought&#xD;
to be rich.&#xD;
During the interviews between Charles and his&#xD;
friend, the good lady would listen. There was only&#xD;
a partition between Charles' studio and the room&#xD;
she did her knitting and spinning in, and she sat near&#xD;
the door. She was generally on the look out for&#xD;
symptoms of secrecy, and if she detected them, she&#xD;
was bound to know what on earth was going on.&#xD;
Well, she was convinced that Charles and his friend&#xD;
were holding secret meetings in the next room, and&#xD;
she thought it no more than right that she should&#xD;
hear as much as possible. In fact, she was corning&#xD;
to the conclusion that Charles was not altogether&#xD;
capable of attending to the important Matter of his&#xD;
own reputation, and she felt by a kind of instinct,&#xD;
that it was her. duty to overhear, so that if anything&#xD;
out of place should be said or determined on, she&#xD;
would know it. And if you could have seen her&#xD;
when she thought she. had got something good, you&#xD;
would have been. amused at the arch look she would&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
Aunt Nancy, as Charles called her, was always&#xD;
glad to see company,'and when Mary came she was&#xD;
delighted as usual. She had something remarkable&#xD;
to tell, and was anxious for an opportunity to com-&#xD;
mence.&#xD;
"Which way is Charles?" inquired- Mary.&#xD;
"O, he's away somewhere. Hle's gone nearly&#xD;
every day. I danit tell you where he is or where he&#xD;
goes, unless it is to see:that stranger that's been comi'&#xD;
here."&#xD;
"What !" asked Mary, " have there been strangers&#xD;
about ?"&#xD;
"O, yes, it's been a month or more since one-quit&#xD;
comm'. He was here every day for two weeks.&#xD;
Where he's gone to now I don't know, and Pai sre&#xD;
I don't care, for I don't think he's just the sort of&#xD;
a man he ought to be. He's bein' telling Charles&#xD;
most abominable things, and I would n't be supprised&#xD;
if they'd both be lost forever, foi all the bad things&#xD;
they've said."&#xD;
"Why, what did they say ?"&#xD;
"Say? why' a good deal more than I'd like, to tell&#xD;
you. They talked about everything good, bad, and&#xD;
nonsensical."&#xD;
"Then they did say something good ?"&#xD;
"Not a bit of a good word did 'I hear. 'They&#xD;
talked about good things and good people in such .a&#xD;
way as no sinners ought. Their talk was trashy stuff,&#xD;
and the best of 'it might 'a been better 'ou't was.&#xD;
But I must say for Charles that he didn't talk as rAch&#xD;
nor as wicked as the feller that was with 'im."&#xD;
"I should be' glad to know," said Mary, "some,&#xD;
things that they did say."&#xD;
" Well, if you anust know, I'll tell you. Perty&#xD;
soon after he first eome, he spoke to Charles sow.&#xD;

believed in witches, I'd expect somethin' to git the&#xD;
matter with our old Redback, for, as he said, she's&#xD;
more than five years. old ; but Mr. Coldines says how&#xD;
that there's no sich things now-a-days as spirits and&#xD;
witches, and may be the old cow 'll git living' her days&#xD;
out."&#xD;
"Was that the worst they said ?" asked Mary.&#xD;
"The worst? no; I should think it wasn't. They&#xD;
talked ever so much against the preachers, and don't&#xD;
I know very well that if it wasn't for them the world&#xD;
would all go to the bad place, Miss Hopewell, and so&#xD;
do you. And then he told Charles 'at if he was to&#xD;
find some feller on the big road with 'is bones bruised,&#xD;
he had a right to go into somebody's elses pantry and&#xD;
take out as much bread and honey as he wanted to.&#xD;
I tell you what, it would'nt do for him to make so&#xD;
free about my house. If I didn't scald 'im it would&#xD;
be because there was no hot water, or no broomstick&#xD;
to hit 'im with."&#xD;
You wouldn't scald him with a broomstick ?"&#xD;
"Hit 'm, I said," retorted Nancy, a little disdain-&#xD;
fully for Mary's want of understanding.&#xD;
"If a troop of mendicants, or penniless refugees&#xD;
from the despotisms of the old world, or. fugitives&#xD;
from Southern bondage, were to come along way-&#xD;
worn and hungry, I should be apt to find the way&#xD;
into your pantry," said Mary, looking mischievously.&#xD;
To this the good woman gave no reply, except a&#xD;
hard look, for she had a dreadful suspicion that Mary&#xD;
had used bad words. And then the idea of. there&#xD;
being an old world, puzzled her; for, as she said af-&#xD;
terwards, "Genesis dosn't tell us of any older world&#xD;
than this." She took a fancy that Mary was too&#xD;
much inclined to sympathize with those she was tell-&#xD;
-ng on, and that the disclosures, were mot so welcome&#xD;
as they would be to a young lady of. the fight sort,&#xD;
and .o he took it pettishly into .her head;not, to tell&#xD;
&#xD;
another word about it., But, after a slight pause,Mary&#xD;
inquired if that was all the stranger had said; This&#xD;
was too- much of a temptation, and the gossip again&#xD;
flowed forth as freely as ever:&#xD;
"Al?   Well, I should think it wasn't all. There&#xD;
was more said than I'll tell you, -Miss Hopewell ,&#xD;
"I should like to hear more of it."&#xD;
"Well, there's one thing yit you ought to know,&#xD;
an' it's a thing we all ought to know, for whoever&#xD;
heerd before that if I worked a day, or my husband,&#xD;
or yourself, Miss 'Hopewell, that we havn't-a" perfect&#xD;
right to all we can airn. Now, this very thing:that&#xD;
strange man.told Charles; and I'll declare if .it didn't&#xD;
make me a little spunky when I heerd it, for I jest&#xD;
thought if I havn't a right to all I can make, who&#xD;
has? and if David hasn't a right to the corn and per-&#xD;
taters he 'raises, what would become of our dear&#xD;
children? Why, they'd haf to starve. - As soon as&#xD;
David came in from work I told him about it, and&#xD;
how do you s'pose the 'simple.man answered me 7"&#xD;
inquired Nancy, pausing for a reply.    .&#xD;
"Indeed I don't know; how did he ?"&#xD;
"Why, all he could say was, 'Hut tut, Nancy,&#xD;
don't bother yourself about things that you don't un-&#xD;
derstand. .Charles knows what he is at, and that&#xD;
stranger is not as bad as you think he is. Isn't din-&#xD;
ner perty near ready, Nancy.' And I tell you, if it&#xD;
was my old man, I felt a little roily. He thought I&#xD;
didn't understand when I -know'd that I did, an' I&#xD;
just told 'im 'at if we didn't all look sharp thesenfi-&#xD;
del fellers would soon turn the world so up sido down&#xD;
'at we'd soon have no dinners to getin a hurry about.&#xD;
.The-first chance-I had [ told brother Coldines, an"i&#xD;
you could only heer'n 'im explain these yer2 things&#xD;
to Mr. Lawease and- Mr. Preachrnanhat was along&#xD;
with 'imp you'd a been astonished. He could seena io&#xD;

"I presume so," said Mary, "he sees into, or at&#xD;
least looks into civil as well as divine law."&#xD;
" I don't know what sort of laws them are, but I&#xD;
do know that brother Coldines's the best lawyer in&#xD;
town, and that he understands what reason and com-&#xD;
mon seme is, for, havn't you heer'n 'im preach about&#xD;
them things; and if any man can tell you what's&#xD;
right, he ken. An' while I think of it, I'll just tell&#xD;
you that he preaches next Sabbath at the meetin'&#xD;
house, and you ought to go and hear 'im."&#xD;
"I certainly shall," said Mary; and the good wo-&#xD;
man was visibly elated.&#xD;
" But you have not told me all that the talkative&#xD;
stranger divulged to Charles."&#xD;
" All? No, and I don't intend to, but I'll just&#xD;
tell you one more thing. He had sich words over&#xD;
and over, as 'development,' 'association,' and a whole&#xD;
pail more sich like, an' if he chaws his tobacker as&#xD;
much as he did them, I'd hate to buy it fur 'im. But&#xD;
what I was goin' to say was, 'at there's a place he&#xD;
called association, which he talked so much about goin'&#xD;
into; I don't know what for a place it is, only I know&#xD;
it isn't a good place, and nobody ought to go into it.&#xD;
I know, too, as how it must be, dangerous, for he&#xD;
said all sich as go there would have to make their&#xD;
wills first. Now, Miss Hopewell, wouldn't that look&#xD;
nice? a young lady like you makin' your will, as if&#xD;
you was about to die, or a-goin' to war."&#xD;
" All associationists are engaged in a holy warfare,&#xD;
they are leaving the beggarly elements of the world,&#xD;
to enlist under the banner of king Immanuel, and&#xD;
.bravely fght the battles of the captain of their sal-&#xD;
vation," replied Mary, with a queenly look and a&#xD;
strong effort of the will, but kindly directed to silence&#xD;
Nancy, and Nancy accordingly quailed before Mary's&#xD;
magnetism and was silent..&#xD;
Charles soon came, and Mary met him s an affe-&#xD;
&#xD;
tionate sister would a true brother. She had just&#xD;
been making the acquaintance of rather a low speci-&#xD;
men of humanity, found it by no means edifying, and&#xD;
so was glad to experience the bracing mag~netisnof&#xD;
one whom she knew, and knew to  e- noble. They&#xD;
spent the balance of the afternoon in Chlarles studio,&#xD;
mingling spirit with spirit. In the evening their&#xD;
provident friend Nancy,-who understood cooking as&#xD;
well as other things, and always meant the best she&#xD;
knew, whatever she did, called them out toa'a smoking&#xD;
supper. Charles would always have his Graham&#xD;
bread, but Nancy had warm biscuit this time  of the&#xD;
finest flour, expressly for Mary, and ws -chagrined&#xD;
that she preferred the brown bread.&#xD;
" Do you take sugar and cream in your tea, Miss&#xD;
HopeweH," inquired Nancy.&#xD;
"I would prefer a cup of cold water, if you please,"&#xD;
replied Mary.&#xD;
" O, if I'd a khow'd that, Miss Hopewell, I'd "a&#xD;
made coffee."&#xD;
"0, no, I use no coffee either; water is my favorite&#xD;
beverage, I sometimes drink milk."&#xD;
«O, well then, you shall have milk," and aunt Nati-&#xD;
cy bustled -off tothe springhouse forthwith, to get&#xD;
some milk. But while she was gone -you might al-&#xD;
most have heard her thinking:&#xD;
" That Miss HopewelPs no great scratch-I knbw'd&#xD;
that though by 'ur dress-it's too short by :a foot,&#xD;
and she lacks more 'an that of bein' a lady;" and as&#xD;
she thought this, she reached down for the crock.&#xD;
At the supper table, the brother and =sisetre gave&#xD;
their chat a greater latitude; and Charles observed&#xD;
that in his rambles last week he learned more of him-&#xD;
self than he had ever known before.&#xD;
"Amongst other things," continued he, "I learned&#xD;
that I am about to. turn Shaker; and some of, tgn&#xD;

I am going to join the Mormons. - They declare that&#xD;
a Mormon elder has been lecturing me until I am&#xD;
fairly converted, and that in the fall of this year,&#xD;
eighteen hundred and fifty-three, I am going out to&#xD;
Nauvoo,"&#xD;
At the idea of joining the Mormons at Nauvoo,&#xD;
Mary and Charles and David laughed, but Aunt&#xD;
Nancy, who understood these things,.or thought she&#xD;
did, looked very demure, as much as to say, " My&#xD;
good friends, it's only too true, and no laughin'-mat-&#xD;
ter.".-&#xD;
" And besides that," continued Charles," there is&#xD;
a pretty general impression, I find, that if I'm not .al-&#xD;
ready considerably crazy, I soon will be. They say&#xD;
that I read and study so much, and have such odd&#xD;
notions, that there must be something wrong."&#xD;
"That," replied Mary, "was something like the&#xD;
conversation 1 overheard coming home. There were&#xD;
four fellows of them who came into the road just be.&#xD;
fore me, and continued within hearing for more than&#xD;
a mile. I was compelled to remain in their company,&#xD;
for when I tried to pass them they spurred up, and&#xD;
when I tried to fall behind; they took it as leisurely&#xD;
as myself. They doubtless thought they were en-&#xD;
tertaining me greatly. I soonsdiscovered that they&#xD;
were discussing the probabilities of Charles Hope-&#xD;
well's sanity, and the general opinion was. that he&#xD;
would be crazy soon, if not so now."&#xD;
The details of this edifying conversation, which&#xD;
Mary did not then give, ran as follows ;---omitting,&#xD;
however, certain em bellishments, which would be too&#xD;
flashy for these unpretending pages:&#xD;
Says Jim,"I'll betchu twenty dollars 'at Charley&#xD;
Hopewell 'ill be crazy in less 'an two years."&#xD;
"Well," said Tom, " if he's not crazy in that time,&#xD;
he'll be's crazy 's a 'loon, in ten.'&#xD;
"I'll betchu what you; dare," said. the third--they&#xD;
called him Jake,-"I'll betchu what you dare that&#xD;
&#xD;
he's a little crazy now. He reads, writes, and studies&#xD;
nearly:all the time. te don't work half the, day.&#xD;
I'll tell you what 'tis, gentlemen, he reads at feast&#xD;
one book clair through, every monthof his life, and&#xD;
I s'pose he must write letters to everybody."&#xD;
"Well, I never got any uv 'em, aniV 'im dam' glad&#xD;
uv it," said Ike.&#xD;
"How many books was that you said he reads&#xD;
through?" inquired Jim.&#xD;
" Why, one every month, as big as Coldines' testa-&#xD;
ment, or one uv 'is lawbooks," answered Jake.&#xD;
" Goshins," exclaimed the other,," wouldn't that&#xD;
much reading' set my head to whirlin'? , It makes it&#xD;
whirl ju to think of it. When we git.to Rtde's&#xD;
I'm bound to have some more of that old rye. .,I'll&#xD;
tell you, gentlemen, if I was to read much, I'd haf to&#xD;
have plenty to drink to make steady with, and keep&#xD;
my sperits up."  To this - they all gave a hearty as-&#xD;
sent.&#xD;
"I'll tell you what it is," continued Jim,"I've been&#xD;
to school but three months in all my life, an' I larnt&#xD;
more then 'an I've, ever know'd, what to do with&#xD;
since."&#xD;
"Well," said Tom,."I've been to school ,more 'an&#xD;
that. I larnt to read, write and cypher as far a0 to&#xD;
the single rule ;"-and here he gave a dignified.and&#xD;
learned look-" and if any feller ken beat me .ealpu-&#xD;
latin' what a load of corn, or a side of meat,,or a&#xD;
barrel of whisky comes to, I'd just like to see 'im at&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"'Well, as to that kind of calc'la tin'," said Jake, "I&#xD;
don't know nuthin' about it, but I do calc'late that&#xD;
I'm a good hand at a side of bacon,, or a .barrel uv&#xD;
whisky."  And at this stroke of wit they did sone&#xD;

" Dan' stubborn fact," replied Jake, "but that's&#xD;
not what we was talkin' about." . They had got to&#xD;
Rude's by this time, and all stopped. Mary mused&#xD;
to herself as she rode along:&#xD;
" That gross being, in the form of a man, is going&#xD;
to get married to a wife nearly as gross, perhaps, as&#xD;
himself. It is sad for the race that such things ;must&#xD;
be; but they will be till the' State advances education,&#xD;
and puts a stop to the manufacture and sale of in-&#xD;
toxicating drinks. I am for the Maine law. It is dis-&#xD;
agreeable to have to live and mingle with such fel-&#xD;
lows,and be made the subject of their coarse remarks&#xD;
and vulgar criticisms. And whilst human beings are&#xD;
permitted to remain so undeveloped, and to make&#xD;
themselves so beastly, how much better it would be&#xD;
for the kindred to group together, and with mutual&#xD;
appreciation, enjoy each other. This is one consider-&#xD;
ation with me why the advanced should seek con-&#xD;
geniality in association. And another is, that since in&#xD;
association there is economy, and in union strength,&#xD;
such as combine their means and efforts for their own,&#xD;
and the general good, would be enabled to operate&#xD;
more successfully upon the .undeveloped classes."&#xD;
But we must return to the supper-table. Mary&#xD;
thought the apple-pies and Graham bread excellent,&#xD;
and in saying what she thought, put Nancyinto such&#xD;
an excellent humor with herself and her Bloomer&#xD;
guest, that she entertained sanguine hopes as to&#xD;
Mary's ladyship, and the good Coldines' sermon the&#xD;
next Sunday would do.&#xD;
Early on Sunday morni 'g there was a man seen&#xD;
riding along with a Buena Vista hat on, and rather&#xD;
countrifed habiliments in every respect, as .much as&#xD;
to say," I'm the people's man." It was Coldines, on&#xD;
his way to the old log meeting-house; 'and the peo-&#xD;
pie saw him, and were on the qui vive, for they knew&#xD;
at once that Charles Hopewell would "ech it, '&#xD;
&#xD;
they said. The word went forth, and the people&#xD;
came, and the-good uid house was full.&#xD;
The sermon was a feast, as usual-a feast for re-&#xD;
formers as well as for anti-reformers, and it would be&#xD;
a dull soul, whatever his faiththat could notflin-&#xD;
tertainment in the variety, and I iight say,'diversity&#xD;
and mixture of such a discourse. I need scarcely&#xD;
say what the text wash for, as _a general thing, the&#xD;
preacher is "not apt to stick to the text; but 'still, as&#xD;
this was a-short one, I will read it: " Evil communi-&#xD;
cation corrupts good manners."&#xD;
He gave, in a very satisfactory and conclusive way,&#xD;
the philosophy of association as it respects the rela-&#xD;
tion' of ideas and the influence of mind over mind.&#xD;
He then went on, as the manner of preachers is, to&#xD;
make the-application. He urged upon, his hearers&#xD;
the great necessity of seeking such association as&#xD;
would enable them the more fully and successfully to&#xD;
adorn their lives with a beautifulgarland of Zhristian&#xD;
graces. This part of the discourse Charles and Mary&#xD;
were delighted with.&#xD;
"Good association," said Coldines,. "is what we&#xD;
should all seek after.  Secure this, and it Will&#xD;
strengthen us in virtue, enable us to grow in grace,&#xD;
and speed us ofiward in the path to 'glory, But,"&#xD;
continued he, and -his countenance began to lower,&#xD;
"there is another kind of association talked aboit&#xD;
now-a-days, and that sort I-would , idvise you tb' be-&#xD;
ware of. There are, in fact, two kinds :' the associ&#xD;
ation with infidels and the association ofinfidels. As&#xD;
to the association which scherhg imen are dressing&#xD;
up in ribbons and roses to fascinate the'lovers of nov-&#xD;
elty, and lead them on to ruid, it is, I need not stop&#xD;
to tell, a machination of the devil to ektbnd and fork&#xD;

&#xD;
the nefarious work of making bad association for&#xD;
men. ' Their disciples, Considerant and Louis Blanc,&#xD;
and others-ofequal infamy, have kept up the vitality&#xD;
of their doctrines in France, while a few renegades&#xD;
from Christianity, such as Robert Owen,Robert Dale&#xD;
Owen, George Ripley, and many more of the same&#xD;
clique, have contaminated the popular mind of this&#xD;
country ;'* and lastly, I understand that some of our&#xD;
Western infidels are aspiring to this highest pinnacle&#xD;
of human folly. Such association as this would de-&#xD;
stroy property, law, order, morality, break the mar-&#xD;
riage contract, annihilate the family ;-in short, pull&#xD;
up the very pillars of society, and erect upon the&#xD;
ruins of the once noble structure the palace of the&#xD;
devil, and gilded mansions for all his high priests I&#xD;
Such schemes and such men, if we are not on our&#xD;
guard, may become as pestiferous to Christian socie-&#xD;
ty as were the frogs and lice to Egypt. They stink&#xD;
with the pestilential atmosphere of radicalism and the&#xD;
vileness of infidelity ; and as evil communication cor-&#xD;
rupts good manners, and as wrong is infectious, I warn&#xD;
you all -to beware. Keep afar off yourselves, with&#xD;
your children and your friends. Shun such prowlers&#xD;
as you would the roaring lion, their master, for like&#xD;
him they are going about seeking whom they may&#xD;
devour. Then I exhort you not only, to beware of&#xD;
the association of such men, but to beware of the as-&#xD;
sociatipnl with such men. When I. meet with such&#xD;
dangerous qharacters- in the every day affairs of life,&#xD;
I recognize :them so far as business requires, but no&#xD;
further. I1 shun them from a sense of duty, and en-&#xD;
treat you all to do likewise. It will not do to en-&#xD;
courage such fellows.- You must put a mark on&#xD;
thmem, as the Lord did upon Cain of' old, and treat&#xD;
them as outcasts. You must put them under the ban&#xD;
of a righteous indignation, treat them with a just&#xD;
~lTinT Psio ike clh. 13&#xD;
&#xD;
and christian contempt, and frown them down as&#xD;
pests of community."&#xD;
And to give this Coldine bull of excommunication&#xD;
due force, he struck the hoard in front of the rude&#xD;
pulpit such a blow, that it danced the bible and&#xD;
pitcher both off on to the floor:--&#xD;
" There," said he, " that Book-that good- old&#xD;
Book-that Book of Books-that only Book, sound&#xD;
and whole as it is, after centuries of disaster which&#xD;
have overwhelmed all profane works in eternal obli-&#xD;
vion, is a fit type of the soundness and integrity of&#xD;
the truth, as it is in Christ Jesus, and as I have this&#xD;
day declared it unto you; while that earthen pitcher,&#xD;
born of clay as it were but yesterday, broken as it&#xD;
now is, into a thousand fragments, is a fair omen of&#xD;
the fate which threatens all infidelity, and especially&#xD;
all schemes of association! Just in this' way have&#xD;
they all gone to atoms, and always will! Let us ac-&#xD;
cept the omen, my friends; it is but reason and com-&#xD;
mon sense that we should !"&#xD;
And here he gave a look of self-complacent triumph,&#xD;
as much as to say: " it was Colines did it;" and&#xD;
there was unusual sensation for a country audience&#xD;
in the West ; and all the people looked at Charles in&#xD;
such a way as to say, they would about as lief be the&#xD;
pitcher as him. But Charles, though almost alone so&#xD;
far as numbers were concerned, faced the staring&#xD;
bravely, and after the sermon was ended, he rose and&#xD;
stated that if the people would tarry for. half an&#xD;
hour, he would bring the discourse they had just&#xD;
heard, under a careful review, and, perhaps, they&#xD;
would be able to detect some sophistry, inconsisten-&#xD;
cy, and fallacy of statement therein. Charles insisted&#xD;
that but one half hour would be sufficient for this&#xD;
purpose. To all of which, Coldines promptly re-&#xD;
plied:&#xD;
"The people wish to retire; they came to hear&#xD;
&#xD;

preaching, and have no desire to hear anything else.&#xD;
It does not do to mix truth and faith with falsehood&#xD;
and infidelity. What they have already heard, will,&#xD;
by the blessing God, do them good ; but to poison it&#xD;
with an infusion of scepticism, would stupefy the in-&#xD;
tellect, irritate the passion, neutralize the blessing,&#xD;
grieve away the spirit, displease our heavenly Father,&#xD;
and do harm."&#xD;
At the close of this eloquent sentence there were&#xD;
several groans of assent, and Coidines prcceeded :-&#xD;
" Besides all this, we must consider that this is&#xD;
Sunday, and infidels should not speak on the Lord's&#xD;
Day." And another volley of groans confirmed what&#xD;
the speaker said.&#xD;
°" Letus pray," said the preacher; and all the faith-&#xD;
ful kneeled, and Coldines prayed, and prayed vehe-&#xD;
mently that the Lord would deliver his people from&#xD;
the wiles of Satan and the snares of the infidel.&#xD;
Next they sung a hymn, and then followed the&#xD;
benediction, after which the people seemed entranced,&#xD;
and stood gazing at Charles; but Coldines waved&#xD;
his hand toward the door, and the people retired, and&#xD;
many that day saw the hand of the Lord in the dis-&#xD;
comfiture of Charles and infidelity.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
MARY AND HER AUNT RUTH.&#xD;
At Church that day, Mary..met with a good old&#xD;
aunt of hers, and the greeting was warm. and cor-&#xD;
dial. Aunt Ruth had never been so fortunate as to&#xD;
meet with her other self, and scarcely hoped to now,&#xD;
that twenty years or more had come and gone and left&#xD;
her still alone. Her face was plain, but her soul was&#xD;
pure, and her heart as warm as ever throbbed in&#xD;
woman's breast. She had a liberal education and&#xD;
considerable of native intellect, thought some, and;&#xD;
was disposed to be liberal in her views; But her&#xD;
mind had been shaped in the conservative mould, and&#xD;
though she accepted some of the reform doctrines,&#xD;
there were others she deemed hideous.. If the re-&#xD;
cently developed principle was not too unpopular&#xD;
and not too glaringly at variance with her early&#xD;
opinion,- but such as could be coupled with what&#xD;
was to her "sound doctrine," she was pretty sure to&#xD;
take it into favor. But if it flatly and plainly con-&#xD;
tradicted the"evangelical faith," she did not hesitate&#xD;
to reject it ;-for she was proud of her orthodoxy&#xD;
and her reputation.&#xD;
She went home with Mary and Charles, and being&#xD;
warmly attached to them, older than they, and sure&#xD;
she could not be much wrong in her views, took the&#xD;
aunt-like liberty of telling them that !she thought&#xD;
them deeply in error; she urged more particularly&#xD;
that they should have some care for their reputation.&#xD;
" You are losing all respect in the eyes oi the peo-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC7393-00000128"/>&#xD;
254             SOCIETY AS T IS&#xD;
&#xD;
ple," said she. "They say that you are wild, vision-&#xD;
ary, unbalanced; and some even of the better sort of&#xD;
people declare that you are getting crazy. You&#xD;
ought to have some regard for public opinion, more&#xD;
respect for the society in which you live, comply&#xD;
more fully and cordially with its requirements, be&#xD;
more like other people, and then you will be honored&#xD;
and respected, and loved. Otherwise you cannot be&#xD;
at peace, and without the kind regards of those&#xD;
around you, you cannot be happy. You ought to&#xD;
have more respect for your immediate friends and&#xD;
relatives.  They have kind regards for you, and&#xD;
would be glad to see you stand high in the esteem&#xD;
of your neighbors; and more than this, they are in-&#xD;
volved in your social behavior. I can assure you,&#xD;
my children, that in bringing disgrace upon your-&#xD;
selves you grieve all of us. You should have a care&#xD;
for the feelings of your friends."&#xD;
Charles and Mary listened with exemplary respect&#xD;
to all of this friendly counsel; and in reply Mary&#xD;
said:&#xD;
" If the spirit of society were right-what it ought&#xD;
to be-then, indeed, should we be careful to stand in&#xD;
good repute; but, believing as we do, that society is&#xD;
corrupt, and its spirit false, we have but littleregard&#xD;
for its censures. If society were to censure only the&#xD;
wrong, and approve the right, then to be unpopular&#xD;
in that society would be to wear the badge of error-&#xD;
the mark of Cain, as Coldines says; but while socie-&#xD;
ty, as, at present, so often approves the wrong and&#xD;
condemns the right, we hold that to be true to our-&#xD;
selves as individuals of a race destined to become&#xD;
more and more exalted, we must often do that for&#xD;
which society will blame us. You know yourself,&#xD;
my dear aunt, how the idolatry of Fashion and 4lam-&#xD;
mon prevails, with all the deceit, insincerity, pride,&#xD;
vanity, and calculating selfishness which attends the&#xD;

sacrifice of humanity to these idols. No, we will not&#xD;
bow to these ugly images ourselves, andif we do not,&#xD;
the idolaters will throw stones at us.&#xD;
"But beside this, there is another idolatry, and&#xD;
you must not, my .kind aunt, think hard of me if I&#xD;
implicate you a little here. The sects, and those of&#xD;
old in whose footsteps the sects follow, have magni-&#xD;
fied an undeveloped man into the immense propor-&#xD;
tions of a god, and him they fear, -cringe to, and af-&#xD;
feet to worship. They tremble at the ideal monster&#xD;
themselves have created, as though he were an actu-&#xD;
al being. With this idolatry we are not in sympathy,&#xD;
and would develop our fellow men into a sphere&#xD;
which does not demand the sacrifice of true man-&#xD;
hood to save the soul. Society is in disorder; the&#xD;
relations of man to man are vicious; and these false&#xD;
relations of man to man and man to God we must&#xD;
strive to correct. Our efforts in this direction neces.&#xD;
sarily make us unpopular, but we shall be conteit to&#xD;
bear. the rudeness of those we would fain relieve&#xD;
from the slavery of which they are not conscious.&#xD;
We must strive to awake them to a sense of their&#xD;
bondage, and then point out the mode of deliverance.&#xD;
It has ever been the fortune of the pioneers of hu..&#xD;
man progress, to meet with resistance from the tar-&#xD;
dy, and suffer persecution from the stupid and inter-&#xD;
ested. It was so with Christ himself, with Luther,&#xD;
and others in religion; it was so with Galileo and&#xD;
his successors in science; with Jenne';Fulton, Fitch,&#xD;
and a host of others in art. These have been called&#xD;
blasphemers, heretics, madruen, fools, and all because&#xD;
they were 'wiser than their times.' We. are con-&#xD;
tent to have such exemplars, and like them we will&#xD;
try to deserve all the opprobrium which -mistaken&#xD;
conservatism can heap upon us."&#xD;
"But still," said aunt Ruth, entreatingly, "yop&#xD;
know the world will have its own way. It is no use&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
for two or three people to set themselves against&#xD;
every body else;-they only give themselves trouble&#xD;
and do no good."&#xD;
" We think," replied Mary, "that the history of&#xD;
the world teaches us a different lesson. Every indi-&#xD;
vidual has his sphere of influence, be it great or&#xD;
small, and he should act in that sphere to the full ex&#xD;
tent of his energies. But further than this: if nothing&#xD;
is effected for the present, something may be for the&#xD;
future. The next generation may become better&#xD;
prepared for the reception of truth, and it is but&#xD;
meet that we apply the filter, and, as far as we can,&#xD;
separate the clean from the unclean,--and ask our&#xD;
brethren to do the same."&#xD;
"You talk of going to association, and that surely&#xD;
would be folly," replied the good aunt. "People are&#xD;
too selfish to carry out such a scheme of society, and&#xD;
you will find it so. They will quarrel with each&#xD;
other, some will leave, the rest lose their enthusiasm,&#xD;
and the project will be abandoned."&#xD;
"I agree with you, aunt," replied Mary; "there&#xD;
are few who are not too selfish to realize association,&#xD;
but we must not judge all by the great mass; or if&#xD;
the many are not ready for a high career, we must&#xD;
not rein back the few. Those only should attempt&#xD;
an enterprise of the kind, who find themselves utter-&#xD;
ly out of place in the general warfare, individual con-&#xD;
flict, and spiritual degradation which abound in soci-&#xD;
ety as it is. None should pledge themselves to each&#xD;
other as brethren for so noble an end as that which&#xD;
association proposes, except such as feel that they&#xD;
are kindred, and have confidence in each other. In&#xD;
such a brotherhood no lasting or dangerous discord&#xD;
can ever spring up. In fact, although associations&#xD;
have for the most part heretofore failed, there has&#xD;
been far less quarrelling than is generaly supposed.&#xD;
In the Wisconsin Phalanx there was little regard had&#xD;
for the quality of the social material of which'it was&#xD;
&#xD;
composed, and yet we are officially told that there&#xD;
never was a quarrel amongst the members up to the&#xD;
time that dissolution had become evident., Whether&#xD;
there was afterward I do not know;-the Phalanxdis-&#xD;
solved, but speculation was the solvent.' Other asso-&#xD;
ciations have fallen, and the cause of failure is to be&#xD;
found in the bringing together of discordant elements;&#xD;
and the baiting of capital.&#xD;
"It is a common remark, I am aware, that the&#xD;
women will quarrel in the .kitchen. If this is neces-&#xD;
sarily so, woman should blush. In. our large hotels&#xD;
the boarding of hundreds is a unitary affair, and yet&#xD;
whatever quarrelling may be done inthe kitchen de-&#xD;
partment does not prevent the extensive and com-&#xD;
modious arrangements there made for prompt and.&#xD;
economical operations. In Paris it is a common&#xD;
thing for the elite and noble to quarter upon some&#xD;
hotel as a place of residence; and'here again there is&#xD;
unity in all that, pertains to procuring and preparing&#xD;
the food ;-it is there as it should be in association&#xD;
Now it would be a sad thing if an association. could&#xD;
not do. what is done every day in the hotels of Paris&#xD;
and New York. I sometimes fear that.women are&#xD;
not as well prepared as men for fraternal association,&#xD;
but if a unitary domestic department in a community&#xD;
could not be conducted for women's quarreling pro-&#xD;
pensities, I should not recede from the fieldvof re-&#xD;
form, but, if possible, redouble my efforts for the ele-&#xD;
vation of woman.".&#xD;
"Well," said aunt Ruth, "even if you get along&#xD;
with your unitary kitchen, still do Ithink .that it&#xD;
would be wrong to adopt such a domestic policy.&#xD;
Each family is' a whole, is an orb in the hutmanitary&#xD;
firmament, and should not blend with others . in tie&#xD;
social system. In your association the family will be.&#xD;
destroyed, and I should think that there could be no&#xD;
sadder catastrophe than this."&#xD;
" Oh no," replied Mary, "you misapprehend the&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
nature of association. You urge the sovereignty of&#xD;
the family against our social plan, as some others&#xD;
urge the sovereignty of the individual. Now, so far&#xD;
as the individuality of the one man or of the one&#xD;
woman, or the individuality of the one family is con.&#xD;
cerned, the social conditions which we propose are&#xD;
far superior to those which now exist. My true in.&#xD;
dividuality can only be maintained when I have&#xD;
within my control such means as are essential to the&#xD;
development of my true womanhood. Without the&#xD;
free use of such means, my individual sovereignty is a&#xD;
mere name. Tp surround me with such social con-&#xD;
ditions as make the choice of evils a necessity, and&#xD;
then tell me that I am self-sovereign, because I am&#xD;
at liberty to choose, is to insult me in the utterance&#xD;
of a palpable falsehood. Now, in existing society, I&#xD;
cannot,-at least the great mass of my sisters cannot,&#xD;
obtain such control of the means of life and develop-&#xD;
ment, and hence they are not individual sovereigns,&#xD;
but an aggregate of slaves. It is just so, too, with&#xD;
the great mass of men. They cannot obtain where-&#xD;
withal to develop their manhood, without first mak-&#xD;
ing a sacrifice of manhood itself.&#xD;
" What is true of the individual is true of that little&#xD;
coterie of individuals which constitute the family.&#xD;
Without the control of ample means for the enjoy-&#xD;
ment of happiness, the true end and aim of familism&#xD;
cannot be attained. Take a family, noble in spirit&#xD;
but poor in purse, make it dependant upon the ca-&#xD;
price of a selfish employer, as employers generally&#xD;
a d necessarily are, and the very nobility is wrung&#xD;
from its spirit, till the soul is as shrunken as its purse.&#xD;
The spirit of the family is gone, and there is nothing&#xD;
left but the toil-worn body. Now, we intend that&#xD;
the very contrary of this shall obtain in association.&#xD;
We design that the individual shall have a soul, and&#xD;
that the family shall have a soul.&#xD;
"We hold that the union of one man with one wo.&#xD;
&#xD;
man for life, is the. eternal and immutable decree of&#xD;
Nature. We would maintain this twain made one,&#xD;
and their offspring, a family individuality distinct&#xD;
from  the balance of the race. They would have&#xD;
their own separate apartments, and furnish them at&#xD;
their own expense in their own way. . They would&#xD;
have their own fireside, their own family communings,&#xD;
and thus, my dear aunt, you see we would not anni-&#xD;
hilate the family nor take down its altar. What we&#xD;
ask is, that individuals observe the requisitions of&#xD;
family and that the family observe the requisitions of&#xD;
fraternity. I almost fear, aunt Ruth, that you leave&#xD;
the element of fraternity out of your social calcula-&#xD;
tions. This is the great error of society as it- is.&#xD;
True fraternity is disregarded as far as possible; and&#xD;
so far as it is necessarily recognized, it is greatly&#xD;
perverted.&#xD;
"I am a member of a family, and have brothers&#xD;
and sisters; but I find kindred spirits elsewhere, and&#xD;
these, too, are my brethren;' I find these and am at-&#xD;
tracted to them by the frate1al impulse, and it is&#xD;
but proper that I should obey te law. We may&#xD;
labor for the means of life as well with our brethren&#xD;
of the community as'with the brethren of the family.&#xD;
Why should we not?   We might habitually partake&#xD;
of the bounties of the table with one class of breth-&#xD;
ren as well as with the other. Why not? Clothing is&#xD;
necessarily individual even in families. The act of pur-&#xD;
chasing or producing the material therefore ia an as-&#xD;
sociation should be fraternal; making for minors and&#xD;
parents and supplying their share of the purchaseniol&#xD;
ney would be a family'affair; the paying and making&#xD;
for others and all the wearing would be individual.&#xD;
"I need say no more. I trust it is plain enough&#xD;
that we aim to give the fraternal element its natural&#xD;
and proper place; and in doing this, we do not neces-&#xD;
sarily subvert individuality either in the person or&#xD;
the family, but,=on the other hand, assign them&#xD;

&#xD;
their true place. The individuality of the person has&#xD;
its proper orbit to move in, and to go beyond which&#xD;
detracts from its own integrity. The family has an&#xD;
individuality, peculiar to itself and its province should&#xD;
be sacred. Fraternity has a sphere of its own, and&#xD;
if permitted freedom of action. therein, its integrity&#xD;
will be in perfect harmony with the integrity of the&#xD;
family and of the individual.&#xD;
"That there may be such a thing as discord in the&#xD;
brotherhood of an association, is no reason .whatever&#xD;
that fraternity should not be promoted otherwise&#xD;
than by the selfish and half way modes of existing&#xD;
society. There is discord in families, and yet the&#xD;
family must be maintained intact. A true family&#xD;
would not quarrel, neither would a true brotherhood,&#xD;
and we should aim at truth in these things as far as&#xD;
practicable. The dissevering of the race into its in-&#xD;
dividual elements, as contemplated by some of our&#xD;
brother socialists, is nothing but a chimera. It neces-&#xD;
sarily overthrows the family and the brotherhood.&#xD;
The solidarity of the race is undeniable. Individual&#xD;
is linked with individual, and family with family. A&#xD;
magnetic chain binds one to all and all to one, and&#xD;
there can be no such thing as practical disconnection.&#xD;
The family must exist and also the fraternity, and in&#xD;
no wise does the latter conflict with the former."&#xD;
"1Well," observed aunt Ruth, "even if it should be&#xD;
as you say, about this, I don't see what you want&#xD;
with any-thing better than the Gospel. If you would&#xD;
only live up to that, you would be happy enough&#xD;
without association. If your new plan of life is not&#xD;
as good as. the one laid down in the Gospel, you&#xD;
would not gain but lose in adopting it. If it is bet-&#xD;
ter, you cannot carry it out, for it seems that Chris-&#xD;
tians cannot or will not live up to the gospel pre-&#xD;
cepts. But I am sure you will get nothing better;&#xD;
and I am sure, too, that you can do no better than&#xD;
just to take this book"~-pulling the Testament out&#xD;

"As we interpret the Gospel," replied Mary, "we,&#xD;
claim to have nothing:better. The spirit of love and&#xD;
fraternity therein inculcated is what we desire to re-&#xD;
alize. 'The Church falls far short of this, and why ?&#xD;
Have you ever looked into this, my dear aunt? You&#xD;
admit that the gospellers do not exemplify the Gos-&#xD;
pel, and yet may be sincere in their professions, and&#xD;
strive to do the best. They fail, and there is a cause&#xD;
for that failure. Now, what is it?  If it is to be&#xD;
found in innate depravity, Christ -was foolish for giv-&#xD;
ing laws and precepts which the very constitution&#xD;
of his subjects prevent them from obeying. These&#xD;
precepts of Jesus may be carried into practice, and&#xD;
that this is not done in the Church, is because the&#xD;
members are subject in every day life to the vicious&#xD;
influence of corrupt social conditions. The chief&#xD;
wrong in these conditions is individuality and isola-&#xD;
tion in connection with the acquisition and owner.&#xD;
ship of property., Out of this isolation and exclu-&#xD;
siveness grows antagonism, and out of antagonism&#xD;
.amongst mankind, who should be brethren, proceeds&#xD;
all manner of viciousness and corruption to develop&#xD;
diabolism and drag down the spirit.&#xD;
"In society as it is, the main sweep of individual&#xD;
endeavor is to the gathering of pelf. Whatever does&#xD;
not contribute to what is called 'getting along in the&#xD;
world,' is regarded by the great mass as not worth&#xD;
caring for. - I have noticed this sordid spirit particu-&#xD;
larly in the patrons of our common schools. The&#xD;
great majority have no higher ideal of education than&#xD;
its practical uses in the. fashionable and business;af,&#xD;
fairs of life. There is a difference in this respecting&#xD;
different districts of the country. 'One wants his son&#xD;
to learn; arithmetic, so that the storekeeper  can't&#xD;

mercenary one, why she should. But others, with&#xD;
more of vanity and less of mammon in them, prefer&#xD;
the showy accomplishments of fashion to the busi-&#xD;
ness substantials of mental acquisition.&#xD;
" One has no higher idea of life than 'getting a liv-&#xD;
ing,' and getting a living has no higher meaning&#xD;
than getting plenty to eat and weai'. It is true that&#xD;
some think about salvation, but this is more par-&#xD;
ticularly a matter for Sunday; for if attended to&#xD;
through the week, it is put in between times; and&#xD;
when business is pressing prayers are cut short, and&#xD;
grace said in a hurry-by some. There is a cate-&#xD;
chism which some such have committed to memory&#xD;
'in the days of their youth,' and now look back to&#xD;
the drudgery of the task, that it is all over, with a&#xD;
great deal of satisfaction, and that catechism asks:&#xD;
'What is the chief end of man?' and answers: 'Man's&#xD;
chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him forev-&#xD;
er.' It would suit the practice of many better to&#xD;
read thus: 'What is the chief end of man ?' 'Man's&#xD;
chief end is to make sure of enough to eat and wear,&#xD;
and to enjoy it as well as he can.'"'&#xD;
"This reminds me,"interposed Charles,"of a strik-&#xD;
ing illustration 1 had the other Sunday, of the grov-&#xD;
elling spirit which pervades society. As I was com-&#xD;
ing from the late funeral, I heard a friend of the de-&#xD;
ceased say: 'It's a pity Pauris died, he was bitten&#xD;
rich as fast as a feller could."'&#xD;
Mary resumed: "The circumstances of life unnat-&#xD;
urally, but legitimately, lead men into this base esti-&#xD;
mate of the true aims of life, and impel the  award&#xD;
but downward in the general current of unn.,.nly en-&#xD;
deavor.e This is a social and moral necessity of&#xD;
things as they now exist.&#xD;
" Amongst such as have a plenty for their natural&#xD;
wants, and those who affect to have, there obtains&#xD;
what sems to them a higher ideal, and they pompous-&#xD;
ly strut out Its ctualization. Their catechism should&#xD;
&#xD;
if&#xD;
ik&#xD;
-&#xD;
&#xD;
read: 'What is the chief end of man?' 'Man's chief&#xD;
end is to dash through the world with a great deal&#xD;
of rattle and show, and to enjoy respectability forev-&#xD;
er.' This, too, is in the Church. It grows out of&#xD;
ignorance and the false relations which obtain be-&#xD;
tween man and man, and can only be remedied by&#xD;
true education and the establishment of true social&#xD;
conditions. These evils we see and, deplore. We&#xD;
will not do as the Church,-court them for self-pre-&#xD;
servation and personal ease and comfort. We will&#xD;
not attempt the remedy by trifling with the twigs&#xD;
and branches of the wrong; we will- go to the base&#xD;
and tear up the tree of evil by its roots. Remove&#xD;
the cause of wrong and wrong will cease. That is.&#xD;
our aim. Create the circumstances of fraternity and&#xD;
fraternity will be a spontaneous production. Create&#xD;
the conditions of love for the true, and love will gush&#xD;
forth a perennial spring of present and lasting hap-&#xD;
piness. In this way only can true Christianity, or&#xD;
as I should prefer to say, a life of truth and love be&#xD;
realized.&#xD;
"Enlighten the intellect, burn selfishness out of&#xD;
the soul, and men would not be content to remain&#xD;
in isolation. They would not, as now, think of car-&#xD;
rying the Gospel in one hand, and the instrumentali-&#xD;
ties of exclusive wealth in the other. They would&#xD;
not only know but feel, that the' two were at vari-&#xD;
ance, and in acting up to the aspirations, of a regen-&#xD;
erated and sanctified nature, they would-well,.aunt,&#xD;
what would they do ?" "Well," continued Mary,&#xD;
"we can only -decide this by ascertaining what, as&#xD;
history informs us, such have already done. We all&#xD;
know of~Ifittle band of socialists that lived about&#xD;
eighteen hundred years ago. They :s9kl:all their&#xD;
possessions, brought the money*. and laid it at the&#xD;
apostles' feet. When people got religion in those&#xD;
days .it had some effect; there was warmth idt, and&#xD;

as selfishness had no abiding place in the heart of him&#xD;
that was 'born again.' Faith, too, had power in&#xD;
these days, for 'all that believed were, together and&#xD;
had all things common. They sold their possession&#xD;
and goods and parted them to all as each had need.'&#xD;
" It is something like this we are aiming at; and&#xD;
you must not blame us, my dear aunt, for trying to&#xD;
live, rather than merely profess the truths of your&#xD;
favorite book. This example was,, given,-it took&#xD;
form spontaneously as a foreshadowing of what the&#xD;
whole race would realize in the far off future. Our&#xD;
exemplars are worthy of imitation, and we are not&#xD;
ashamed to follow as nearly-as we can in their foot-&#xD;
steps. They fell into communism because their man&#xD;
hood was developed by the operations of the spirit,&#xD;
and selfishness eliminated in the development. The&#xD;
reason the existing Church prefers isolation and an-&#xD;
tagonism, to fraternity and harmony, is because the&#xD;
spirit no longer operates. Manhood remains unde-&#xD;
veloped and selfishness prevails in the counsel of the&#xD;
soul. In the mention of soul, I speak of the individ-&#xD;
ual, for the Church is a body without soul; and so&#xD;
sure as dead bodies decay, so sure will the cold and&#xD;
lifeless Church crumble to dust and drift away before&#xD;
the sweeping winds of heaven."&#xD;
Disconcerted either by Mary's arguments or her&#xD;
calm, quiet, but triumphant manner, the kind old&#xD;
aunt made no further objections, but only expressed&#xD;
her regret to Mary and Charles, that their case&#xD;
seemed so hopeless.&#xD;
" It is not hopeless," replied Mary; "we are Hope-&#xD;
wells; and I trust that for your own happiness, my&#xD;
dear aunt, you will not indulge uneasiness or con-&#xD;
cern on account of our opinions and purposes. You&#xD;
think us in error, but I know that you believe us&#xD;
honest in what we believe and ,intend. Why not&#xD;
consider that inasmuch as our minds are differently&#xD;
gonstituted, and eduestion unlike- irinany respect,&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
we may all look at the highest subjects to which we&#xD;
can address ourselves, and see them altogether in a&#xD;
different light, and that one is as likely to be wrong&#xD;
as another? We cannot all be right, and there is no&#xD;
one of us, doubtless, but entertains much error. But&#xD;
while we are thus fallible, we should endeavor to be&#xD;
sincere and candid; and one may effect good in one&#xD;
way and another in a different way. We do think,&#xD;
that under such considerations, all our friends who&#xD;
differ in opinion from us could afford to be charita-&#xD;

bound to you by the ties of .blood relationshipr-xh9re&#xD;

" O, I did not mean to blame you," said aunt Ruth,&#xD;
earnestly but affectionately,, as a tear started to ,her&#xD;

CHAPTER&#xD;
&#xD;
XVIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
OHARLES AND THE WARRENITE.&#xD;
The next day Charles was visited by a friend who&#xD;
claimed to belong to the school of Warren. Social-&#xD;
ism was of course the theme. The visitor objected&#xD;
to Charles' idea of association, on the ground that a&#xD;
constitution and by-laws would be necessary.&#xD;
"Language," said he, "is such an imperfect medium&#xD;
of thought, that one of your people will interpret the&#xD;
constitution one way, and another in a different&#xD;
way; you will soon get at loggerheads about what&#xD;
our laws mean, and your fanciful ideal of brother.&#xD;
hood, will be sadly marred in the actualization."&#xD;
" As to that," replied Charles, "we are both' in-&#xD;
debted to the English language. You take five sen-&#xD;
tences of it with which to announce your general&#xD;
principles; I detail more, and take fifty. Now I&#xD;
should prefer the fifty, since they would make my&#xD;
plan of society more definite and understandable than&#xD;
the five would yours.&#xD;
"Your school ," continued Charles,"certainly gains&#xD;
nothing by narrowing down its basis of operations&#xD;
to five written propositions. One of your expositors&#xD;
after having written seventy pages on one of these&#xD;
propositions, and over two hundred on another in&#xD;
coopection with the first, has charged as misappre-&#xD;
henslon,an understanding of the limit of individual&#xD;
soveieignty, as itiferred from his language by several&#xD;
&#xD;
AND AS IT SHOULD~ BE.         267&#xD;
&#xD;
of his readers to my certain knowledge, and two of&#xD;
his critics. Now if it be so ea: y to misapprehend&#xD;
the principles which lie at the basis of this plan, after&#xD;
volumes have been written in exposition of the same,&#xD;
why object to a constitution upon the ground that it&#xD;
may be differently interpreted ? You recognize cer-&#xD;
tain principles, without which you say yoy~r plan&#xD;
cannot be realized. If the doctrine of individual sov-&#xD;
ereignty, which you claim to be, if possible, the most&#xD;
important, is so difficult to be understood; and if in-&#xD;
dividual sovereignty, as you say, cannot be fully in-&#xD;
stalled without a practical .recognition of the cost&#xD;
principle, why then it is a radical necessity that these&#xD;
principles be understood-announced and explained&#xD;
as they are in English. If an articleof ten sections&#xD;
in a social constitution should define each of these&#xD;
principles, and as many by-laws point out the meth-&#xD;
od of their practical workings, I do not know why&#xD;
such constitution and by-laws would not answer the&#xD;
purpose as well as the several volumes which seem&#xD;
so necessary, and then fail to give clear and definite&#xD;
ideas of what is meant by the five propositions of the&#xD;
'Science of Society.'&#xD;
"I must think that your school is, in this respect,&#xD;
a little like two or three of our modern sects. They&#xD;
deny creeds and declare that they are not sects, and&#xD;
yet they have actually as definite a system of believ-&#xD;
ing as those which have written creeds;.and what is&#xD;
worthy of note is that these same no-sects, taking&#xD;
the Scriptures only for their guide, differ as to what&#xD;
the Scriptures mean, and areas hostile to each other&#xD;
as if they had written declarations of faith., We all&#xD;
learn pretty definitely what theirseveral notions are;&#xD;
and how? simply frontheir writings and preachings.&#xD;

&#xD;
have no constitution formally written, but they have&#xD;
one practically, nevertheless;-and if we have a&#xD;
creed, I dont know but we may as well write it out&#xD;
by articles and sections.&#xD;
" We have our principles, without which we think&#xD;
true association cannot be realized, and we only ask&#xD;
to express them more definitely by greater amplifi-&#xD;
cation than five short sentences would be. We&#xD;
would prefer ten or twenty times five. This might&#xD;
enable us to dispense with a volume or two on the&#xD;
practical details and philosophy of our scheme. A&#xD;
true constitution would be an expression of the unan-&#xD;
imous voice of all; and the by-laws would be a guide&#xD;
to the efficient and orderly transaction of business,&#xD;
and in all this there would be no sacrifice of real&#xD;
liberty."&#xD;
" Your close combination," replied the other, "will&#xD;
not work. To be perfectly harmonious, all interests&#xD;
must be perfectly individual."&#xD;
That is impossible," responded Charles; "there&#xD;
can be no such thing as perfect individuality in human&#xD;
interests. If you and I instead of owning in partner&#xD;
ship a horse which both of us want to use, you own&#xD;
him entirely, and I use him halt' the time, paying half&#xD;
the expenses, as Warren has it, our interests are not&#xD;
perfectly individual, unless you can manage so that&#xD;
the horse will be one thing for you and another for&#xD;
me. Evidently if I overwork the animal, or founder&#xD;
him, I unfit him for your service and throw you be-&#xD;
hind hand in your work. I must say, my fiend, that&#xD;
this notion of a disconnection and perfect individual.&#xD;
ism of interest is all nonsense. There can be no&#xD;
such thing except in the imaginations of men. The&#xD;
solidarity of the race is God-made, and no man, men,&#xD;
nor school of socialists can set it aside. Individuals&#xD;
have connection with each other in their business re-&#xD;
lations, and always will iiae,.and it it for us not to&#xD;
&#xD;
!4&#xD;
&#xD;
dissever interests and promote selfishness at the ex-&#xD;
pense of fraternity, hut to determine how this busi-&#xD;
ness relationship shall be one of harmony, and not as&#xD;
it is now, one of discord."&#xD;
" Well," said Charles' friend, "we have atleast this&#xD;
advantage over you:-we have:the management of&#xD;
our own property affairs, and no unworthy business&#xD;
agent can run off with our money, or in any way em-&#xD;
bezzle the funds of the 'association."&#xD;
b I may not be as well informed," replied Charles,&#xD;
" as I should be in the history of the various associa-&#xD;
tions which have sprung :Up since the general abita-&#xD;
tion of the social question, but in these I have not&#xD;
heard of any losses whatever by the dishonesty of&#xD;
business agents. There have been losses by impru-&#xD;
dent management, but none by dishonest manage-&#xD;
ment. 1 have never heard of any losses of the kind&#xD;
in any of the communities, except in the Union Vil-&#xD;
lages of the Shakers near Lebanon', Ohio. A vulgar&#xD;
unprincipled man by the name of Sharpe defrauded-&#xD;
them of a considerable sum, and almost everybody&#xD;
knows of Sharpe and his swindle. Some of my more in-&#xD;
telligent neighbors assure me that there is great dan-&#xD;
ge' of fraudulent operations of this kind in association,&#xD;
and to prove it they tell me of Sharpe. Not con-&#xD;
founded by this, I give them a list of associations and&#xD;
communities, many of which have long been in op-&#xD;
eration, and ask them to instance another example of&#xD;
fraud, and I have not found any one who could do&#xD;
so. Now, all this bugaboo about losing property in&#xD;
association by fraudulent management, arises from&#xD;
an intimate practical acquaintance with the dishon-&#xD;
esty which prevails in existing society, and without&#xD;
making an allowance either for m  enor conditions;&#xD;

&#xD;
tory is on our side here, and more potent with the&#xD;
most of persons than logic, and to that do we&#xD;
appeal.&#xD;
"4Men are losing every day by the mismanage-&#xD;
ment and dishonesty of partners, and yet men&#xD;
are entering daily into commercial firms and other&#xD;
partnership establishments. Yet if we talk of asso-&#xD;
ciation, our kind friends, concerned for our welfare,&#xD;
tell us that somebody will run away with our money.&#xD;
It is, however, but natural that those who are op-&#xD;
posed to the movement should make some sort of&#xD;
objection, and this is as convenient a one as could be&#xD;
used."&#xD;
" I do not approve of these commercial combina-&#xD;
tions," replied the other, "any more than I do of&#xD;
association."&#xD;
"I am aware of that, but the very fact, notwith-&#xD;
standing the disadvantages and losses incident there-&#xD;
to, that men will fraternize in commercial and indus-&#xD;
trial affairs, charitable institutions, public improve-&#xD;
ments, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c., should, I think, be taken as evidence&#xD;
of the associative tendency. This instinct of our&#xD;
nature may lead either to evil or good, and it is but&#xD;
wise that we study it, find its proper sphere, give it&#xD;
full freedom therein, and then will good only attend&#xD;
its manifestations.&#xD;
"You spoke of the advantage of having the busi-&#xD;
ness control of your own property. In this I think&#xD;
we have an advantage over you-that of consistency.&#xD;
We acknowledge connection in the business affairs&#xD;
of men, and we live up to our faith; you declare for&#xD;
disconnection, and yet there is in all property inter-&#xD;
ests an inter-relationship which you are compelled&#xD;
to recognize in -practice.. You must put ,your neigh-&#xD;

prudent and hones in business. You mpst examine&#xD;

wrong doing in one way, might it not answer quite&#xD;
as well to modify a little the plan of meddling, and&#xD;
also the mode of visiting the penalty or applying the&#xD;
remedy. There is one thing Iam sure we would&#xD;
gain, and that is consistency;-the practice would&#xD;
correspond to the theory."&#xD;
After some further discussion and friendly conver-&#xD;
sation, the visitor left, well satisfied that his own&#xD;
scheme is actually the "science of society."&#xD;

CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
THE PROMISES OF ASSOCIATION.&#xD;
Shortly after Charles' Warrenistic friend had de-&#xD;
parted, Amelia, a friend of Mary's, came in, and as&#xD;
the discussion of social doctrines had been fairly be-&#xD;
gun, Mary, Amelia, and Charles continued it. Ame-&#xD;
lia was a married woman, with three children pretty&#xD;
well grown. She deplored isolation and its evils,&#xD;
and was a socialist by a necessity of her nature. She&#xD;
had studied the subject, formed her ideal, and was&#xD;
eager to attempt its actualization. She and her hus-&#xD;
band were ready for association.&#xD;
Mary observed that the social scheme had solved&#xD;
for her the problem of woman's rights. "In the&#xD;
order of society which social enterprise would estab-&#xD;
lish," said Mary, "there may be perfect freedom, and&#xD;
woman may sustain her true relationship to man.&#xD;
This is what it seems to me never can be in existing&#xD;
society, lumbered as it is with the awkward and un-&#xD;
wieldy machinery of political organization.. 'The&#xD;
world is governed too much,' and as it advances,&#xD;
should be, and will be governed less and less, until&#xD;
statutory law is practically unknown. 'Then will the&#xD;
social body have a living soul to which the members&#xD;
will be obedient and the movements harmonious.&#xD;
Political government is phenomenal; it pertains only&#xD;
to a certain stage of humanitary development; it is&#xD;
destuied to pass away, and until it does so, there&#xD;
&#xD;
will be wrong in the premises, and woman must be&#xD;
content to suffer her share. It.is a necessity. Del.&#xD;
icate and refined woman does not choose the sphere&#xD;
of politics, and she never will do so. She may, how-&#xD;
ever, be driven into it by the ambition and masculine&#xD;
aspiration of a few of the sex, together with the deilI&#xD;
and despotism of party. In association it will be&#xD;
different. In the social community there is no vioe&#xD;
lence inanything that pertains to suffrage oralegisa&#xD;
lation,-there is no comingin contatwitvile char+&#xD;
acters as there would be in State or nationaWpoitr;&#xD;
Hence perfect freedom in association, in all that be-&#xD;
longs to the administration of itsgovernment, may be&#xD;
accorded to woman without fear of necessitating her&#xD;
precipitation, by the force of false.eircumstance, into&#xD;
a sphere of action for which she has no tasteor at.&#xD;
traction, and in which she must peril 'her purity; and&#xD;
innocence. She will be enfranchised by the common&#xD;
consent of all, and there will be no misgiving on 'the&#xD;
part of her brethren or herself as to, the 'conse&#xD;
quences,&#xD;
"It may be long before the, political accidents of&#xD;
undeveloped society will pass awayy that woman may&#xD;
find relief from the wrongs which pertain thereto,&#xD;
and enter into a full fruition of a just and reasonable&#xD;
liberty; but even now, with the rights-of conscience&#xD;
guaranteed and guarded as they aire, t is woman's&#xD;
power to -release herself from the' thraldom of eat&#xD;
isting institutions, social and political. This is true&#xD;

&#xD;
woman is made dependent on man for the means of&#xD;
a Comfortable living, and then she falls a victim to his&#xD;
licentiousness. If she escapes as lover she is saeri-&#xD;
fieed as wife. She has no power to remonstrate;&#xD;
but open up the channels of labor, compensate her&#xD;
equally with man, and she is in circumstances of in-&#xD;
dependence which will enable her more.eaiciently to&#xD;
protect her own chastity anddemand a decent re-&#xD;
grd for parity in the habits- of men. Woman will&#xD;
not be bound-upin a true association as now, by the&#xD;
for~tles of- fashionable society, and may exercise&#xD;
greater freedomr as is her right, in matters of court-&#xD;
ship. And lastly, in all that pertains to education&#xD;
womaan .will be the rightful peer of man. With these&#xD;
advantages in association the taxation of her prop-&#xD;
rty by the State, without representation, will work&#xD;
norpraeticai wrong to her, and thus, as I .said, by&#xD;
sorting to association she redeems herself from the&#xD;
slavery ef society as it is. Association is her refuge&#xD;
and her hope. When I look at the advantages of&#xD;
such an enterprise, I do deplore the ignorance and&#xD;
lfahness which stands in the way of its realization.&#xD;
Woman seems to be tardy and backward here, but&#xD;
ae is. waking up, and must yet see the true mode of&#xD;
her emancipation."&#xD;
"I have seen it for years,", said Amelia, "and the&#xD;

sanguine, but fell experience has at times - almost&#xD;
made me despair. Without much property and un-&#xD;
able to hire help, I have had to support the drudgery&#xD;
of the kitchen, and the care-taking of my children.&#xD;
Instead of living up to the aspirations of a human&#xD;
being, I have had to be a work-brute; and when one&#xD;
is exhausted, body and soul, in menial service, the&#xD;
tendency is toward.beastliness, and nothing elsecan&#xD;
be inade of it. Assodiationwill relieve this care and&#xD;
anxiety, and drudgery, and these, brute-tendencies.&#xD;
It will enable us, by sisterly .helpfulnesstod:ivwPQ:&#xD;

And in this tendering mutual assistance and laboring&#xD;
with each other in fraternal interest, we will develop&#xD;
a spiritual.sympathy which under circumstances of&#xD;
isolation can never-obtain. Our interests being har-&#xD;
monious the conditions of fraternal sympathy are-es-&#xD;
tablished, and happiness such as earth has seldom&#xD;
known, will bless-us all Love will be a spontaneous&#xD;
offering to fraternity.           -&#xD;
" The drudgery, exposure, and mental inquietude&#xD;
of life in isolation are fruitful sources of physical de-&#xD;
pression and ill-health.  Association will remove&#xD;
these causes of disease, and the physical vigor and&#xD;
general good health of the inmates will be greatly&#xD;
promoted.. We might have a 'Water.Oure' and our&#xD;
physician near. By these meanss we might attract&#xD;
sojourners among as who should come with ill-health&#xD;
and go away restored;-taking home with theni a&#xD;

"'The industrial ar-rangements of association -will&#xD;

seem to us calculated best to promote the end in&#xD;
view. There we may cultivate the whole mind,&#xD;
adopt the principles of true education, and briig up&#xD;
the young in the way they should go. Education&#xD;
as thorough as it can be made, may begin in youth,&#xD;
and be carried on through life so as to develop man-&#xD;
hood and womanhood into the beauty and nobility&#xD;
of their native proportions. We may cultivate&#xD;
whatever in science, art, or literature we feel at-&#xD;
tracted to; and when the pecuniary basis is well es-&#xD;
tbHshed, we have only to consult our own legiti-&#xD;
mate tastes, and turn to the means of their grati-&#xD;
fication."&#xD;
" We must not be too sanguine. in our anticipa-&#xD;
tions," said Mary, "but still, what you have said is&#xD;
true, and all that is required is prudence, to consum-&#xD;
mate it all. One thing I should rejoice to see in an&#xD;
association, would be an observatory with a good&#xD;
telescope and astronomical instruments. It would&#xD;
be so grand and elevating to look away into the&#xD;
starry heavens, and contemplate the Creator through&#xD;
the immensity of his wonderful works! Some might&#xD;
qualify themselves for service to the science, but I&#xD;
should value an acquisition of  the kind more for its&#xD;
moral and spiritual influences.&#xD;
" We might make geological tours, and in this&#xD;
way form a practical acquaintance with that won-&#xD;
derful book in which God has written the natural&#xD;
history of the earth. We might collect the fossil&#xD;
relics of those ancient beings which had our world&#xD;
all to themselves so long before man made his advent&#xD;
as the subduer of earth. Such a collection of speci-&#xD;
mens, as the result of our own- energies, would be a&#xD;
treasure with the values attached. thereto, not only of&#xD;
science but of fraternity.&#xD;
"We might occasionally call to our aid other&#xD;
priests of nature than our own, and learn frem-them&#xD;
&#xD;
the revelations of the spirit. Science, shorn of its&#xD;
moral teachings, would have no great charms for me,&#xD;
but in flashing upon the soul the grandeur of our&#xD;
God, it -becomes enchanting.&#xD;
" Healthful and nourishing food would be provided&#xD;
for the social, oral, and intellectual cravings of the&#xD;
mind, and it would 'grow in grace,' and attain to the&#xD;
'full stature of a maii.' Acquisitiveness, deprived of&#xD;
its morbid aliment, would dwmidle from a monsterto&#xD;
natural being, and no longer curseR the e M thwit&#xD;
its mhe benign influence of true association would&#xD;
not 'be confined to the inmates, but would pervade&#xD;
society without. It would be, a light kindled on the&#xD;
hill-tops, sending its gleams into the darkness around.&#xD;
It would teach by example and also by precept.&#xD;
It would establish a press, and according to the meas'&#xD;
ure of its capacity freight its messages to the people&#xD;
with wisdom and love. It would be a home for the&#xD;
missionaries of reform. Their families would have&#xD;
an abiding place in the association, with. opportufl-&#xD;
ties for labor and with a fair compensation, and thus&#xD;
the self-sacrificing reformer would be free from anxi-&#xD;
ety as it concerns either present or future wants.&#xD;
Reform-teaching should be' made free to the' people,&#xD;
and this can be done as a general thing only by as-&#xD;
sociation. Charging so much per head for a -lecture&#xD;
is abominable, although at present often a necessity&#xD;
without which the lecture could not be given. The&#xD;
commercial spirit of the times should be taken into the&#xD;
reformatory movement as little as possible, and with,&#xD;
out fraternity of effort; so much money will have to,&#xD;
be demanded for -so much talk. The truthful who have&#xD;
truth to give'rejoice to tender it 'without money and&#xD;
without, price,' and circumstances should be such&#xD;
that thy may do so. Association for noble pur-.&#xD;

them for usefulness, and send them into the world&#xD;
as apostles of truth. Much of all this, however,&#xD;
could only be done when the association is placed on&#xD;
a firm pecuniary basis. I am sure that the nine-&#xD;
teenth century will witness the fulfilment of this&#xD;
day-dream.. But we must not be in haste. We&#xD;
must fix our eye upon the end, and move forward&#xD;
steadily and surely toward it, turning neither to the&#xD;

d7 am convinced of the correctness of your re-&#xD;
marks," replied Amelia, "and shall be as patient as&#xD;
any one through all the intermediate stages of the&#xD;
enterprise. I look at it in this light, that I may as&#xD;
well be calm and deliberate, for unwise haste in too&#xD;
many of us, might defeat the end so eagerly sought,&#xD;
and isolation atill would scourge us. I long for as.&#xD;
sociation for my own sake and my children's, but&#xD;
more particularly for theirs. The worst season in&#xD;
the rearing of my family is over; our property af-&#xD;
fairs are now in a prosperous condition, and so far&#xD;
as my husband and self are concerned we could get&#xD;
along the way the world goes, but we want advan-&#xD;
tages for ourselves which association will furnish,&#xD;
but which we can not have in isolation. We might&#xD;
be content, however, with our present lot, were it&#xD;
not for the future uncertainties which we know&#xD;
to be in reserve for our children.    We, may&#xD;
have plenty to eat and wear, and procure it with&#xD;
reasonable effort, but the case may be different with-&#xD;
them. But if they should not fail in obtaining a suf-&#xD;
fictency, they may have to purchase it: at the ex-&#xD;
pense of their noblest aspirations: This is a thought&#xD;
which I cannot bear. That my children and the ris-&#xD;

"Your remarks," observed Charles, "remind me&#xD;
of certain objections-which are made to our social pol-&#xD;
Icy some say that to give capitalio interest will&#xD;
keep mronied men from entering, while it will entice&#xD;
the penniless merely to prey upon the benefits of&#xD;
other people's capital. I answer them by saying&#xD;
tlftt such as are too sgJfishto share with their breth-&#xD;
ten; would ha too selfish to be my fraternal peers un-&#xD;
fti'rcumstances, and that I do not wish to offer&#xD;
inducements to such to enter into a social enterprize&#xD;
with me. And as to the intrusions of such as would&#xD;
enter only to reap the advantages of other's capital,&#xD;
I answer that as 'guilt will-out,' so will motives, and&#xD;
that it is no very difficult matter to understand the&#xD;
symptoms."&#xD;
"f'am acquainted," replied Amelia, "with six or&#xD;
eight persons, each.of whom is worsh thousands,-&#xD;
not many thousands, of course, and yet they all de-&#xD;
sire association upon the principle of no interest to&#xD;
capital, and will enter the first opportunity. A part&#xD;
of these will d6 so for their own immediate good and&#xD;
the exemplary influence which such an institution&#xD;
would have upon the social tetidencies of the age.&#xD;
The othersgare actuated by the double motive of good&#xD;
to themselves and the rising generation. Besides&#xD;
these, I am acquainted with others without funds,&#xD;
whom their brethren with capital would take into&#xD;
cordial fellowship upon equal terms with themselves.&#xD;
They are well assured 'that their moneyless friends.&#xD;
have the right spirit, and are aiming at the true ends&#xD;
of humanitary' being. The 'selfish, 'judging by their&#xD;
own 'standard,- would of course impute selfish mo-&#xD;
tives, for sudh cannot conceive that men may be&#xD;
disinterested. 'But it 'is, nevertheless, possible for us&#xD;
to ascertain what the essential germ  of any one'g&#xD;
&#xD;
.     nature is, and if this gives promise, as it may, of at&#xD;
gradual development into the fair proportions of&#xD;
manhood, or womanhood, we may cultivate it for the&#xD;
beauty of the flowerand' the richness of the fruitage.&#xD;
An institution: of the kind- could not undertake the&#xD;
cultivation of any kind of a germ, for that would-be&#xD;
to throw away its energies, and defeat the end of its&#xD;
existence.&#xD;

numerous one, or if such institutions should multiply,&#xD;
and the unmarried generally form an acquaintance&#xD;
with their peers in other associations, there would be&#xD;
every opportunity for the suitable mating of such&#xD;
as would live up to their destiny.&#xD;
" There will not only be better opportunities for&#xD;
proper matrimonial alliances, but for better condi-&#xD;
tions under which to fulfil the duties of maternity.&#xD;
Under existing conditions, the rich mother is debili.&#xD;
 tated amidst idleness and dissipation, and is unfit to&#xD;
bec&amp;amp;me a parent. The poor one is worked into a&#xD;
brute; and though the circumstances of the 'middle&#xD;
classes' are better, yet even here the mother has her&#xD;
distracting cares, feverish apprehensions, and often&#xD;
oppresive toils. In association the. distraction of&#xD;
care will be gone, as well as the jading influence of&#xD;
labor. There will be no apprehensions about the&#xD;
bread and clothing of the future. The mind of the&#xD;
prospective mother, surrounded by harmonious cir-&#xD;
eumstances, will be calm and quiet. Her conditions&#xD;
will be those of unmixed hopefulness. She will have&#xD;
the means and opportunities of a high spiritual, cul-&#xD;
ture, and while she develops her own womanhood,&#xD;
and out of the benignity of her nature dispenses hap-&#xD;
piness upon those around her, she may usher into&#xD;
being a humanitary germ as a promise of the future,&#xD;
and a blessing to herself and to the race. The laws&#xD;
of hereditary descent are well known to exist, and&#xD;
we should be diligent to study, and careful to observe&#xD;
them.&#xD;
"I may be an enthusiast, but I regard socialism as&#xD;
the converging, point of all true reform. Of the&#xD;
present humanitary efforts, education is,.however,&#xD;
the greatest. The field of its operations, has greater&#xD;
. breadth than any other. The youth must first be&#xD;
disciplined ;-this lies at the- basis of. all---is the most&#xD;
momentows in its consequences. Until this is achieved&#xD;
&#xD;
there is no chance for improvement; but discipline&#xD;
well the mental powers, and then may theological&#xD;
reform remove the shackles of the old theologies, and&#xD;
leave the intellect at liberty to search out the true&#xD;
conditions of mental freedom and spiritual progress.&#xD;
But practical socialis ra alone an achieve this freedom&#xD;
and open up the pathway of progress. Social reform,&#xD;
in all its various branches, is the means of human re-&#xD;
demption. The bird that is tethered cannot soar&#xD;
toward heaven, nor can the soul that is fettered. To&#xD;
the advanced, association is full of promise. Ti' arer-&#xD;
nity and harmony must triumph. Just so sure-as&#xD;
men are noble intheir nativeaspirations jdust sosure&#xD;
must isolation and aits scourges be ;a btndoned f&#xD;
the truth and beauty and harmony of 'fraternal&#xD;
union. Much that I say may seem   visionary, but&#xD;
you know, my friends, that great realities are- genera&#xD;
ally visions firsi'"&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
-HARLs' MISSION.&#xD;
-Duiwan Mary's stay the mysterious socialist made&#xD;
herself and Charles a'visit. How well -he conducted&#xD;
himself, how manly was his bearing, and how lovely&#xD;
and intellectual were Mary's manner, and conversa-&#xD;
tion, I do not design to tell, for which I trust the&#xD;
reader .will pardon me as well as.dfor the concealment&#xD;
of the visitor's name.&#xD;
After the enjoyment of a "feast of. reason and&#xD;
flow of soul," in a conversational prelibation of the&#xD;
" good time coming," they all three went on a visit&#xD;
to the little coterie of socialists of whom the-visitor&#xD;
had already made honorable mention to Charles.&#xD;
Having arrived, they received a warm welcome and&#xD;
an abundance of sympathy. Charles,-who had been&#xD;
lonely so much and so long, found congenial repose&#xD;
to his inner self and the sympathy of fraternal spirits.&#xD;
One, especially, who was there-a sister-spirit pure&#xD;
and kindred, made glad his heart.&#xD;
There was a friend of Mary's in the vicinity, who&#xD;
had been in the habit of meeting with the socialists of&#xD;
the place, but learning that practical things were&#xD;
intended, she had made up her mind to be absent.&#xD;
She was all in love with the theory of socialism, but&#xD;
doubted its practicability. She was anxious, how-&#xD;
ever, for others to make the experiment, but pre-&#xD;
ferred not to help any herself. Mary accordingly&#xD;
called, and when she did so, told Delia what the&#xD;
friends were intending.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why," said Delia, "you would not go into such&#xD;
an enterprise--at first, anyhow, would you?"&#xD;
" Think I should," replied Mary.&#xD;
"Not right along with the pioneers?"&#xD;
" Yes, tight along with the pioneers."&#xD;
"Well, I would want, before starting, to have a&#xD;
room to  into."&#xD;
"So would I," answered Mary, " but as soon as&#xD;
there is work there for my head, heart, or hands I&#xD;
shall go;"&#xD;
"You may, but I cannot leave my pte etWhon&#xD;
to go anywhere."{&#xD;
" Yes, but, Delia, you would leave it to get married,&#xD;
would you not?"&#xD;
Delia blushed an unmistakable affirmative, and&#xD;
Mary continued:&#xD;
"Now, your friends by spiritual sympathy:,will, It&#xD;
is probable, all leave you for community life stone-&#xD;
where in the West ;-if 'yo- were to go along, you&#xD;
would be there to assistin the new enterprise by the&#xD;
very fact:of your presence as well as by your sisterly&#xD;
council and the labor of your hands. And yet you&#xD;
would not leave home for allthese considerations,&#xD;
while you would do so to get' married.!"&#xD;
Delia blushed again, and Mary proceeded:&#xD;
"I know that marrying is=eonsiderable of a busi-&#xD;
ness with us girls, and marrying right should :be&#xD;
paramount, but still as going into association would&#xD;
not interfere to the disadvantage of this matter,!&#xD;
should prefer to assist in the enterprise. -&#xD;
"Well, to tell the trutl,"replied Delia," Iwould&#xD;
rather not enter association fortafew years yet-as&#xD;
long as I have as good a home als I have now. -fel&#xD;
freer, and' c in'haVe6more"time for selfottste. It.is&#xD;

&#xD;
I could not endure all the cares of domestic life in&#xD;
isolation."&#xD;
"Why, Delia, I fear you are, selfish. As to you&#xD;
feeling freer here than in the. community, I am sure&#xD;
that it would be just the reverse. And as to time&#xD;
for self-eulture, you are always complaining of the&#xD;
great quantity of work you have to do. I have&#xD;
thoughtvin reading your letter and hearing you talk,&#xD;
that you were drudgery's very slave.  Now so&#xD;
great would be the economies in the community that&#xD;
we-would have more time than in isolation. 1 am&#xD;
surely not mistaken about this. What I have feared&#xD;
most i association, is, that women will not find&#xD;
labor enough to keep them properly and remunerat-&#xD;
ingly employed, but our sister ielen Marie Weber&#xD;
has obviated this difficulty in showing: by precept&#xD;
and practice, that the:tilling of the soil is well adapted&#xD;
to female industry.- But none need labor in this&#xD;
field, but such as feeL attracted to it.&#xD;
"But. you say you will enter association because&#xD;
you could not endure the harrassing service of do-&#xD;
netsic life in isolation. Now, if you should marry a&#xD;
richer wa who could afford to relieve you of this&#xD;

that isolation is the best place to find! a seeialistic&#xD;

with you.. I will not think that you are calculating&#xD;
too coolly for self. You are only under theinduence&#xD;
of the popular magnetism without knowing it. The&#xD;

heed that you are quailing before this spirit. And&#xD;
not only so, I fear that you betray that womanish&#xD;
want of enterprize, which I have so much deplored&#xD;
in our sex. Our want of independence and enter-&#xD;
prise makes men -sneer ,when we talk of wo-&#xD;
man's rights. I think, Delia, it should be a. object&#xD;
with every one of usto -how an individuality of&#xD;
character which must challenge the respect of men,&#xD;
and prove us worthy of all we ask&#xD;
"For my own part, I feel too much eniapture,&#xD;
with the cheering promises of social reform to absent&#xD;
myself from the beginnings of an association when it&#xD;
most needs help. I am- comfortably-situated where&#xD;
I am, but as I expect.,to find more desirable condi&#xD;

wrong there, and regets that she falls so far below&#xD;
her own ideal ; but when she sees her friends&#xD;
deliberately adopting a course of conduct which she&#xD;
could not think of, she is sorely grieved. But she&#xD;
never indulges in blame. She has a depth of philoso-&#xD;
phy and a breadth of soul which makes her kind and&#xD;
tolerant to all.&#xD;
That evening Mary and Charles attended a meet.&#xD;
ing of the practical socialists, at which all were&#xD;
present; including Amelia and her husband.  The&#xD;
nEWDmnial scheme and the principles upon which it&#xD;
is based, were made the subject of a free interchange&#xD;
of thought. The plan was agreed upon by all as one&#xD;
altogether worthy of acceptance. They admitted,&#xD;
andthe originator himself amongst the rest, that there&#xD;
might be parts thereof which a practical test would&#xD;
enable them greatly to improve. This, -however,&#xD;
according to the plan itself, would be easily done, if&#xD;
found necessary or expedient; and as they found&#xD;
themselves to be" of one mind in the acceptance of&#xD;
the general spirit and principles as true, and ani.&#xD;
mated by a oneness of purpose, they anticipated no&#xD;
difficulty in a practical way from taking the plan as&#xD;
a basis of practical operations.&#xD;
Having thus decided, they : ascertained what&#xD;
aniount of available funds they could all furnish with&#xD;
which to procure suitable lands for the enter-&#xD;
prise. Charles and Mary gave their-little, and in all&#xD;
they made up a sum of about two thousand dollars.&#xD;
After this, each in turn, commencing with the&#xD;
youngest, gave his or her idea of what would con-&#xD;
stitute a good location for - the social experiment.&#xD;
Thir done they authorized Charles and another of&#xD;
the brethren, to take' the ready rreans of the fratern-&#xD;
ty,-and go westward to look out, and if possible&#xD;
locate, -a suitable place for their future home.&#xD;
F       i The next day Charles and Mary.set ot theirr&#xD;
little farm; and as the vacation had nearly expired,&#xD;
&#xD;
she returned to the school to discharge hipr duties&#xD;
there, and await the issue of Charles' nission..&#xD;

&#xD;
THlE purposeE.'&#xD;
&#xD;
IN parting with the reader, swillju  sa Sey,'persoia&#xD;
propria, that what is contained in the last few&#xD;
chapters is not all fiction. One purpose of this&#xD;
book is, of course, to propagate the doctrines which&#xD;
it contains; but the principal and immediate object&#xD;
is to make known the views of a little brotherhood&#xD;
of socialists, and ascertain whether there be others&#xD;
who sympathize with our spirit and accept our&#xD;
principles. The initiatory steps are being taken for&#xD;
a practical attempt to be based upon the plan here-&#xD;
in laid down. In the present crisis of things, it will&#xD;
avail but little to talk about radical social reform.&#xD;
We must act, and prove our faith by our works.&#xD;
The people want more evidence of the practicability of&#xD;
association, and will not exercise - faith until the&#xD;
demonstration is made ;-and the brave must make it.&#xD;
If any one should detect that our social policy is&#xD;
inconsistent or impracticable, he might confer a&#xD;
favor upon a few of us by pointing out the mischief.&#xD;
The reasons, however, must be given, or the- warn-&#xD;
ing will not be heeded. We have no oracles and&#xD;
accept nothing upon authority. Anything like an&#xD;
argument will be well considered, but ridicule or&#xD;
declamation will be taken as evidence of the want of&#xD;
argument.&#xD;

It handled at all by Fourierists and Warrenists,&#xD;
this little volume expects no handling with gloves on,&#xD;
nor does it, ask, it. The book may be easily killed,&#xD;
but if so, the author is willing that it shall die. But&#xD;
whatever may be its fate, there are a few of us who&#xD;
design that its doctrines shall live, and clothe them.&#xD;
selves in an external form less dependent upon popu-&#xD;
lar favor for existence than this book is. We will&#xD;
carry out this design for ourselves, but we wish the&#xD;

THE SPELLING REFoRM-Instituted to make the education ofthe poor possi-&#xD;
ble, by rendering the arts of Reading- and Writing pleasant and easy to ac-&#xD;
quire. PHONOTYPv Is a rational system of spelling words ,s they are pro-&#xD;
nounced, by employing an enlarged alphabet containing a separate lett r for&#xD;
each sound, by which means the drudgery of learning to spell is entirely:dis&#xD;
pensed with, and learning to6 read is accomplished in one fourth of the time -&#xD;
required in the old way.. PHONOGRAPHY is a truly philosophical method of&#xD;
writing the English Language, by an alphabet compoed of the simplest geo-&#xD;
metrical signs, which accurately represent the sounds of spoken- words. It&#xD;
may be wrttten six times as fast as ordinary longhand, and is equally legible;&#xD;
and such is the simplicity of the art that its principles may be easily mastered,&#xD;
even without the aid of a teacher.&#xD;

WEEEY PHONETIC ADVOCATE,&#xD;
4 Journal of News, Education, Miscellany and Reform.&#xD;
Printed on an Imperiat Sheet of Good White Paper.&#xD;
LONOLEY &amp;amp; BROTHER, EDITORS AND PUBLISHERS.&#xD;
Terms, $2,00, in Advance.&#xD;
CINCINNATI.&#xD;
ALnew volume, (the sixth) of this widely circulated and popular&#xD;
journal, will commence in January, 1b53. It will'then be printed&#xD;
on entirely aw  fl, of the most beautiful pattern ; and in every&#xD;
particular the paper will be done up in the best style of the print.&#xD;
1ng'art&#xD;
ITS PHONETIC CHARACTER.&#xD;
The orthography of the ADVOCATE will not conform to that of&#xD;
Wbbster nor V walker ; but it will be so much more simple and con&#xD;
sistent that no one will find any difficulty in reading it. As here-&#xD;
tofore, its object will be to advocate the adoption of the improved&#xD;
or Phonetic Alphabet,--primarily, as an aid to tjhe pupil in learn-&#xD;
ing to read the common spelling, and ultimatel*, as an entire sub-&#xD;
*t tuta for the present inconsistent and cumbersome orthography.&#xD;
The advantages of a Phonetic Family Paper ar numerous, among&#xD;
which are, 1-One-eighth more reading matter is printed on the&#xD;
same sized sheet, in consequence of the omission of silent letters,&#xD;
double letters, etc.; 2-Poor readers, and children just learning&#xD;
will rapidly improve under Phonetic training ; 3-The hard words&#xD;
of our own language, and the foreign names now constantly recur-&#xD;
ring in the news of the day, will in Phonetic print become as easy&#xD;
of pronunciation as those most.familiar ; 4-Phonetic reading will&#xD;
soon correct the improper and slang pronunciations that one may&#xD;
have carelessly acquired.&#xD;
ITS EDUCATIONAL AND MISCELLANEOUS CHARACTER.&#xD;
In the Scientific and Literary departments, the ADVOCATE can be&#xD;
excelled by but very few weeklies in the United States. It has a&#xD;
numerous list of talented contributors, who keey its columns well&#xD;
filled with original EssAYs, DiscussIoNs, BIOGRAPHIEs, STORIES,&#xD;
PorraY, &amp;amp;%.&#xD;
COMMERCIAL    AND  AGRICULTURAL.&#xD;
The interests of the Merchant and the Farmer are attended&#xD;
to carefully each week, by giving the state of the Market, and care-&#xD;
fully corrected lists of the Prices Current.&#xD;
SUPPLEMENT (to the Advocate); a neatly Lithographed&#xD;
