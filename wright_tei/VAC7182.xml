            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I HAVE said so exactly what I want to say here, in the Preface to a little book
               printed last year, that I make no apology for reproducing it. I have only to add to
               it, that the stories herein contained are <emph>legends</emph> in no accepted sense
               of that word. They are purely imaginative, with the exception of two of the poems,
               and their object is simply to swell the mass of loving and beautiful thought about
               St. Mary, Care has been taken to see that they are theologically correct. The
               exceptions referred to are a family tradition which has never keen printed, and the
               idea of the "Shrine of Bornhofen," a legendary thought common to half the parishes in
               Northern Europe and told in many ways by many persons already.</p>
            <p>In spite of all that orators have said, and sweet poets sung about that miracle of
               love, the heart of a human mother, we cannot fathom its warm depths, nor wholly
               comprehend its motives of action, nor the direction which its impulses suggest One
               thing we know of it, that the<pb n="vi-vii" xml:id="VAC7182-00000004"/> power of its
               love can give infinite value to the smallest offering it receives; and that it does
               not judge of a child's gift by its worth in the worldly sense. And we doubt whether
               the rich powerful son, who out of his abundance, allots to his mother thousands a
               year, so thoroughly stirs the deep waters of her heart, as when the little one, the
               darling comes with flushed face and big dancing eyes full of fondness, and brings her
               some poor wilted daisy gathered in the fields for her.</p>
            <p>There was no philosophical, or educated sense of duty here, but only the pure human
               love sown by our Lord in the little heart as He sowed the wild flower in the field,
               and as yet uncorrupted by this world.</p>
            <p>Now, our Mother Mary's heart is a human mother's heart, possessing naturally all the
               distinguishing attributes of a human mother's heart, even its proneness to
               indulgence, its uncritical pity and tenderness, and if, we may so speak, its
                  <emph>weaknesses</emph> of love: and she receives from any of us who have the
               grace so to offer it, the least tribute of fondness, and repays it with ineffable
               wealth.</p>
            <p>Remember Who was her own child here; I mean merely His humanity,—how stainless,
               faultless, beautiful, affectionate, unerring He was,—and then remember how the nuture
               and education and constant companionship of that perfect Childhood, must have ripened
               and developed in her the mother characteristics and attributes, to a degree
               immeasurably unattainable by the mothers of other children. And when you have thought
               well over that, you will recognize how the Catholic is enabled to retain so much of
               the <emph>simplicity</emph> of filial love; how he still believes that he can
               propitiate his Mother's displeasure, or enkindle her love by even the smallest gifts
               he may bring her. We say <emph>small,</emph> for so they are, compared with what we
               might do; but she can make them of infinite worth by the alchemy of her love. A
               mother on earth has a power in that way immeasurable and incomprehensible by us: what
               power then has that Mother, who, in addition to the most perfect of human hearts, has
               been drinking in the limitless love and glory and pity of God, for two thousand
               years, in heaven.</p>
            <p>This is why we offer books like this to our Mother, and, through her and for her, to
               her children. Let who will, old or young, read this book with a tender and devout
               heart, and he will reap benefit from it. The place of the Critic in heaven, if place
               there be, has not yet been revealed. The place of the loving soul is known. Think
               only how far a little genuine, true love may go. You know that a little mite of pure
               gold, beaten out, will cover a large frame and defy the dust and worm and mould and
               burning heat to injure what it covers. So the love that instigates and then enwraps
               the lesser Catholic devotions the gift to God or Mary of a flower, a book, a bit of
               lace for the altar, defends the heart that gave the gift from so much dust of
               negligence and worm of vicious association, and fiery heat of passion and corroding
               mold of sloth.</p>
            <pb n="viii-ix (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC7182-00000005"/>
            <p>It is in this spirit that we offer our "LADY OF LITANIES," and, if accepted in this
               spirit by its purchasers, it may prove a pleasure to Saint Mary, and consequently a
               benefit to us.</p>

               <head>BRENDA.</head>
               <p>BITTERLY and fierce howled the pitiless Northwest as it swept, from the fields of
                  perpetual frost, over Iceland and the chill North Sea, and vexed into white
                  frothing anger the waves that wash the skerries at the mouth of the great Gulf of
                  Trondheim. It raised the great billows from the heart of the gulf, and drove them
                  resistlessly on till they broke and sounded on the eastern shore like the tramp of
                  invading armies.</p>
               <p>Not a sail was to be seen upon the waters; all had fled to the sheltered coves and
                  havens, like so many affrighted sea-birds; for the wind was white with snow, which
                  shut out the sight of everything at a little distance; which whirled in eddies
                  over the top of the waves, and lay along the coast in deep valleys and ridges;
                  which pelted at door and casement, blew in upon the floor over the threshold, or
                  swept down the chimney and hissed in the flame of the pine logs.</p>
               <p>The Pagans, of whom there were many still in Norway, and even the
                  recently-converted Christians, while they blessed themselves with the holy sign,
                  muttered that Nippen the Spirit of the Storm was out to-night But the faster the
                  snow fell, the wilder the wind howled, the higher where the logs piled up, and the
                  turf foundation of the fire reformed on the wide stone-hearth of Magnus Thurleson.
                  There the red fire light filled the whole room, flickering up amid the strong fir
                  rafters of the ceiling, or flashing upon the bear spears, battleaxes, huge spiked
                  maces, coats of mail and long double-handed swords, which hung upon the panneled
                  walls.</p>
               <p>Around the cheerful blaze sat the master of the house, a giant Norwegian of fifty,
                  and his comely dame, their only daughter Brenda, and a young man of twenty-four or
                  five. A little by themselves were grouped the domestics of the house—the men
                  making nets or carving beechen bowls, and the women twirling the busy spindle, or
                  making garments of fur. A large niche, containing a rude yet pleasant picture of
                  Our Lady and a well-formed iron cross, showed that the family was a Christian one.
                  Indeed, that might be told by the ejaculatory prayers of the women whenever a
                  blast fiercer<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC7182-00000013"/> than usual howled past the
                  house and shook the stout door in its fury.</p>
               <p>"What makest thou there, Svend Ulfsen?" asked the deep voice of the master. The
                  young man addressed smiled as he replied,—</p>
               <p>"'Tis a bridal crown."</p>
               <p>Stout Magnus laughed.</p>
               <p>"A fine employment," he said, "for a warrior and hunter. Dame Bertha, wilt thou
                  lend me thy distaff? I, too, would try some woman's work. Is the crown for thine
                  own fair brow, pretty Svend?"</p>
               <p>The young man laughed merrily in reply and held up the wreath, saying,—</p>
               <p>"Own that no maiden's fingers could frame a prettier one."</p>
               <p>It was very beautiful, although very simple. He had merely twisted among the
                  scarlet berries and satiny green leaves of the ground arbutus the spotless and
                  beautiful pearls of the mistletoe; and it was far fairer than any product of the
                  goldsmith.</p>
               <p>"And now for its purpose," said Svend; "it is for the sweet bride yonder." And,
                  rising, he crossed the hearth and put the wreath gently upon the fair forehead of
                  Brenda. She looked up at him with a calm, pure smile, and the eyes of the mother
                  filled with tears, and even the stout father sighed as he looked at the young
                  girl.</p>
               <p>"And now," said Svend, "with the mistletoe on your forehead, you might defy even
                  Nippen himself, if he ventured to appear."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the latch of the door was raised; the heavy oak leaf flew open; and,
                  in the midst of a whirl of snow, a small, shaggy, white figure seemed to be swept
                  into the room.</p>
               <p>"Saint Olave, sain and save us," muttered the startled servants at this
                  apparition; but Svend only laughed, and went to shut the door, which required an
                  exertion of his stout arm to accomplish.</p>
               <p>"Why, Afra," he said, "you look like an Arctic bear, were it not for those bright
                  black eyes of yours. Where, in the name of all the storms, did you come from? Did
                  Zernebok fetch you?"</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the figure threw back the bear skin hood in which the head was
                  enveloped, and disclosed the face of a girl She was so small that she looked at
                  first much younger than she really was; but a moment's observation sufficed to
                  show that she was a woman of twenty. The swarth skin, the masses of black hair,
                  the wild black eye, the diminutive form; showed that she was of Lapland race;
                  while her great beauty and Oriental delicacy marked her out as the child of some
                  wealthy chief.</p>
               <pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC7182-00000014"/>
               <p>"Ah, Afra, is it you?" Brenda called out, as she advanced to help off with the
                  heavy fur mufflings.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes' said the girl hurriedly, as she seemed, by her haste, rather to shun
                  the Norse maiden's assistance; "it is I, at home once more. What is that crown
                  upon your forehead, Brenda?"</p>
               <p>"It is her bridal crown," said Svend, laughing; "and I will make one for you when
                  your time comes." The eyes of the Lap girl flashed a glance of irrepressible
                  anger, but she said nothing; but quietly advanced to salute old Magnus and his
                  wife.</p>
               <p>"Welcome, girl!" said the Norseman, as he gave her his hand. "But how has so frail
                  a creature weathered such a storm?"</p>
               <p>"She can ride on the winds, the little witch," said Svend, with the manner of one
                  long accustomed to tease.</p>
               <p>But Afra looked quiet and grave as she replied:</p>
               <p>"The children of the old' gods have nothing to fear from the spirits of the
                  air."</p>
               <p>"A fig for the old gods," said Magnus. "You must rid yourself of that nonsense
                  now, Afra, and become a good Christian like Brenda and Svend and the rest of
                  us."</p>
               <p>"Brenda and Svend!" muttered the girl, "those two names always together."</p>
               <p>"What say you?" asked Dame Bertha, kindly. "And you great men cease teasing the
                  child. Come here, Afra, to your old place on the stool here beside me. You are
                  just in time. On the day after to-morrow our Brenda is to leave us."</p>
               <p>The young Lap grew deathly pale, but recovered as she felt the touch of Brenda's
                  hand, and heard her say:</p>
               <p>"You must take my place beside my mother, Afra. Will you not?"</p>
               <p>She did not answer, but lifted dame Bertha's hand to her lips, and received a
                  caress in return.</p>
               <p>Then said Magnus Thurleson:</p>
               <p>"We sit late this stormy night, and are forgetting the good habits of Gammle Norge
                  (Old Norway). And all must be up betimes; for we have much to do for our Brenda,
                  so soon to be ours no longer."</p>
               <p>The stout old father's voice shook as he said these last words; and then Brenda
                  went and kneeled down before him. He kissed her forehead, and, laying his hands
                  upon her head, said.</p>
               <p>"God and Our Lady Mary's benediction be upon thee, my child. And now for the hymn
                  and the night prayer; and so to rest."</p>
               <p>Then the busy wheel and spindle stopped; and<pb n="16-17"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000015"/> the men closed their knives or put away their
                  net-needles; and all the work was laid aside, and the litter swept into a corner
                  of the wide hearth; and then all kneeled down before the crucifix and the picture,
                  and Brenda's sweet voice chanted to slow and simple measure the verses of a hymn;
                  and all the other voices joined in the chorus of the response.</p>

               </lg>
               <p>Then the night prayers were said; and all rose from their knees, making the sign
                  of the cross. Then the spiced sleeping cup was passed round, as ancient Norse
                  custom requires; the Good Night was interchanged, and all sought their rest.</p>
               <p>The wind continued to blow fiercely long after all in the house had sunk into
                  profound repose, but towards midnight it decreased and died away, until at last,
                  the heavy snow fell perpendicularly through the gray hazy moonlight.</p>
               <p>Afra the Lap had followed Brenda, for she had been considered as a sort of half
                  friend, half attendant of the daughter of the house, ever since, eighteen months
                  before, she had first entered the family of Magnus. She had come there as a sort
                  of hostage for her father's good conduct at first, but was soon, for her singular
                  beauty and wild deer-like ways, made a pet of, and then used to go freely to her
                  tribe and return when she pleased. Brenda had given her the affection of a sister,
                  and had taught her all that she was willing to learn: namely, whatever tended to
                  ornament, as embroidery or the dying of furs. She held the spindle in perfect
                  contempt as being work for slave women.</p>
               <p>Religious lessons made but slight impression upon her. She would learn prayers and
                  hymns readily enough-and go about the house singing them, but she seemed to have
                  little or no feeling of their sentiment. Indeed she had a dread of the "White<pb
                     n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7182-00000016"/> Christ" as she called Our Lord, and could
                  be brought to regard Him only with fear, saying always, that one day He would come
                  and destroy all her people.</p>
               <p>She had that pride of the savage which prevents the asking of questions, and was
                  therefore often under misapprehension, and her anger was quick and reckless; but
                  with all, it was impossible for her to be important in any way in the well
                  regulated Norse household. Bertha and Brenda, it is true, really loved her and
                  treated her, the one as a child and the other as a sister; but the dependants
                  feared her, and with Northern superstition asserted that all Laps were wizards and
                  witches, an impression which she herself labored to keep strong in their
                  minds.</p>
               <p>As for Magnus and Svend Ulfsen they seemed to regard her as a wild animal;
                  caressing, petting, and, on Svend's side at least, teasing her as they might have
                  done a young hind.</p>
               <p>When the two maidens reached their room, they sate for a while beside the large
                  warm stove and Brenda questioned the Lap about her journey. She had been absent on
                  a visit to her tribe.</p>
               <p>"But whence came you to-night, and through such a storm?"</p>
               <p>"My father brought me," she said.</p>
               <p>"What," said Brenda, "did your father bring you here and go away without entering
                  the house of Magnus Thurlesen?" The red of the girl's fair cheek deepened as she
                  spoke, for this was an insult to Norse hospitality.</p>
               <p>Afra hastened to say that he had not been within half a mile of the house.</p>
               <p>"Besides," she added, "this is the Odin month and he may not enter the doors of a
                  stranger.</p>
               <p>"But you, Afra? how did you come the half mile and alone, on such a night.</p>
               <p>"Hist!" said the Lap in a low voice, "The spirits of the storm cannot injure me, I
                  know their spell."</p>
               <p>"Oh, Afra," cried the Christian maiden reproachfully "You promised me to deal no
                  more in those horrible pagan superstitions. Thou must depend upon Christ our
                  crucified Lord, and on Mary, His dear Mother, for protection. Thy gods, as thou
                  dost call them, if they are not demons are but brutal stocks and idols."</p>
               <p>"Hush," said the Lap, "they may hear thee, dost thou not fear Zernebok?"</p>
               <p>"No, Afra, a pure heart, fortified by the Cross fears nothing from him if he exist
                  indeed. Come,<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC7182-00000017"/> I will tell thee again of
                  the Christian's strength, and of Love given over unto Death for us."</p>
               <p>The lids drooped heavily over the large eyes of the young pagan, and she yawned
                  slightly.</p>
               <p>"Ah, true!" said Brenda gently, "I forgot, poor child, that thou art weary.
                  To-morrow, we will talk about these holy and beautiful things. Say now thy prayer,
                  Afra, as I taught thee."</p>
               <p>The Lap girl knelt down by the knees of her friend and repeated half singing, some
                  versified devotions. But her lips only uttered them, for her wild, bright
                  sleepless eyes look round and round the room, unseen by Brenda, whose own gaze was
                  fixed upon a sacred picture over the stove. When the Lap had finished, the Norse
                  maiden kissed her forehead and said,</p>
               <p>"Now go to thy rest and sleep well, little sister."</p>
               <p>Little further preparation made Afra. Dragging from a closet a pile of soft
                  dressed skins and furs, she arranged them on the floor near the bed of Brenda, and
                  then seemed suddenly to disappear in the midst of them, rather than to go to bed.
                  In three or four minutes her low deep regular breathing satisfied Brenda that she
                  slept.</p>
               <p>Then her own prayers were said, the lamp, never put out at night in Norway, was
                  carefully veiled, and in a few moments a sweet and peaceful repose sealed her
                  innocent eyes.</p>
               <p>The snow still, fell without, but in profoundest silence, and the night waned on
                  towards the morn. Then Afra heard the bark of the Arctic fox. Her great eyes
                  flashed in the dimly lighted room as her fixed gazed and parted lips bespoke
                  attention, Again the bark was heard fainter and apparently farther off, and then
                  all was still.</p>
               <p>Then Afra rose, and with noiseless step approached the bed and looked earnestly
                  upon Brenda's face. The innocent girl was in a profound sleep; her long lashes
                  rested motionless upon her cheek; her breathing was the full soft breathing of
                  deepest slumber. On this picture the Lap girl gazed with distorted face and eyes
                  full of hate. Then, moving silently as a beast of prey, she rolled together the
                  furs in which she had lain, opened the door, passed through and closed it after
                  her.</p>
               <p>In two or three minutes more she stood at the doorway of the house looking out
                  over the snowy deserts. Then three shadowy figures appeared from different
                  directions, and as she raised her hands moved swiftly and stealthily towards her.
                  She turned into the house, and they followed her; stealthily across the great
                  room, stealthily up the<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC7182-00000018"/> stairs, and into
                  Brenda's room, until the four stood silent as death beside the sleeping girl.</p>
               <p>A motion from Afra and a pair of small dark sinewy hands were raised; another
                  sign, and they closed upon Brenda's pure white throat.</p>
               <p>She awoke in horror,' but the cry was stifled on her lips. In a moment she was
                  gagged; rolled up and securely swathed in the covering of the bed itself, and then
                  lifted up by strong arms and borne away noiselessly, stealthily out into the bleak
                  night.</p>
               <p>Merrily singing an old Norse stave, Svend Ulfson descended to the common room, and
                  merrily he greeted Magnus as he entered. And soon the whole family were gathered,
                  all standing and as if waiting for something. After a moment or two of silence
                  Magnus said:</p>
               <p>"Where then is my Northern Rose this morning? Brenda is no lie-a-bed. Run up, Ulla
                  Troll, and see what keeps the young mistress."</p>
               <p>"I will go myself," said Dame Bertha; "the children may want something."</p>
               <p>The mother went up stairs, and all was silent again. Minute after minute parsed,
                  and at length Magnus waxed impatient.</p>
               <p>"Are we to have no prayer this morning?" he said. "Up, Ulla, and see what keeps
                  the old dame now." The girl ran up stairs, and in a moment the whole house
                  resounded with her shrieks.</p>
               <p>Magnus and Svend bounded like lions, and followed by the whole household, sprang
                  towards Brenda's chamber.</p>
               <p>There they saw the mother apparently paralyzed; she had sunk upon her knees; her
                  hands were clasped, her face was white as ashes, her dilated and terrified eyes
                  were fixed upon the bed. The couch itself was much disturbed and stripped of all
                  its covering.</p>
               <p>For a moment the tall Norseman was stunned. Then as he returned to his senses he
                  saw, lying near the foot of the bed, a fur cape such as all used for outer
                  covering, but too dirty for any save a Lap to wear. He walked to it and turned it
                  over with his foot. It was branded in the inside with a rude representation of a
                  hammer.</p>
               <p>"It is the thunder-hammer of Thor, the badge of Lafflan's tribe," said Svend
                  Ulfsen.</p>
               <p>"If——," said Magnus, and his voice broke as he covered his face with his hands for
                  a moment, and then resumed in a voice so low and terribly earnest that the
                  bystanders shuddered. "If he<pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC7182-00000019"/> have done
                  this deed, by God, Mary and Olaf, I will make the snow round his villages
                  crimson!"</p>
               <p>The voice of her husband recalled dame Bertha to consciousness. She rose, and
                  tottering to him sank upon his broad breast.</p>
               <p>"Why do you stand gaping here?" asked the Norseman, sternly, "away! and arm you to
                  the teeth. Thou Haco, quick to Trondheim, rouse the Jarl Olafs power; get what
                  deer and sledges you can speedily and overtake me at the head of the gulf. Ye
                  maidens, look to your mistress."</p>
               <p>He gave his wife into the arms of her women and descended to arm himself; then
                  bound on his snow shoes and set put at a rapid pace, followed by Svend and the
                  other young men.</p>
               <p>"It will be a black day for the robbers when they meet Svend Ulfsen," said a boy
                  to an old servitor. "Did you see how he stormed with anger?"</p>
               <p>"Aye, he was hot enough," said the ancient, "but the low quiet voice and the
                  bloodshot eyes of our lord showed that the dreadful Berserk rage was on him.
                  Svend's fathers have long held the faith of Christ; but Magnus is the first born
                  Christian of his race. Fear the quiet strong man ever, my lad, more than the
                  fierce one.</p>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>"The young mail's wrath is like straw on fire,</l>
                  <l>But like red hot steel is the old man's ire!"</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Brenda, bred in the hardy Norse fashion, and full of inherited as of innate
                  courage, had not fainted. She was dizzied and uncertain in her thoughts, but she
                  knew that calmness would come by prayer, and so she gave herself up into the hands
                  of the Mother Most Pure, unto whom she had been self-dedicated from early
                  childhood. Into her protection she commended herself, soul and body, and
                  by-and-bye confidence and quiet came back to her heart.</p>
               <p>"That purest Mother will guard me," she thought, "and by her prayers God will set
                  me free, in His own good way. His will, not mine, be done in this and in all
                  things."</p>
               <p>Meanwhile she was placed by the person who had brought her down stairs, in the
                  arms of another, who set off with her at a rapid rate. She knew by the long smooth
                  stride that he had snow shoes on. In a few moments her bearer paused, a hurried
                  whispering conversation ensued, and then she was placed amid a mass of furs; some
                  one arranged himself behind her; the cry uttered by the Laps to their reindeer was
                  given in a low voice, and she knew that she was in a sledge and gliding swiftly
                  over the trackless wastes of snow.</p>
               <p>A few moments after, she felt the thick veil in which her head had been wrapped,
                  unfolded; the<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC7182-00000020"/> gag was removed and the
                  veil replaced. "So then," she thought, "I am too far from home for my voice to be
                  feared. So much the more perfectly then must I depend upon divine assistance."</p>
               <p>The positive hopelessness of human help gave her a more complete disposition to
                  resignation; and from earnest and long prayer, lulled by the swift, steadfast
                  motion and by the warmth of the furs, she sank gradually into a dreamless
                  sleep.</p>
               <p>Then on, northward through the winter midnight swept the sledges, for there were
                  three, drawn each by four powerful reindeer, on over valley and plain, skirting
                  the bases of white ghastly hills on the bleak shadowy edge of dusk pine woods On
                  swiftly northward until the moon faded and the pallid grey dawn appeared in
                  heaven. Then the stopping of the sleigh awakened Brenda, and she could hear the
                  Laps talking and laughing loudly and freely. She could even perceive the strong
                  alcoholic odor of the Arki, a fiery liquor which they distill from the berries of
                  the cedar, juniper, arbutus and other northern plants.</p>
               <p>Then when fresh reindeer had been yoked to the sledge, they dashed forward again,
                  and continued on their course till long past noon of the short northern day. Then
                  a shout from the driver, answered by cries from many voices, informed the captive
                  that they were entering a village. Finally they stopped altogether, and Brenda was
                  lifted out amid screams of derision and anger from voices of women and children,
                  and borne into what she presumed, by the almost stifling atmosphere, to be a Lap
                  hut. Here the thongs that bound her manifold wrappings were cut, the footsteps of
                  her bearer departed and she knew that she was alone.</p>
               <p>A few moments served to disengage her from the skins in which she was wrapped,
                  then she untwisted the veil from her head and face and saw that she was in a
                  rather large apartment and alone. As her eyes grew accustomed to the dim fire
                  light, she recognized, lying upon a rude bench beside her, two or three of her own
                  robes and a mantle lined with sable fur, the gift of her fond father on the last
                  festival of Our Lord's Nativity. Quickly clothing herself, she knelt down, again
                  made an act of resignation to the will of God, prayed again for His help and
                  protection, and then rose and looked around her.</p>
               <p>The room or den, for it deserved that name, was nearly square and hung with
                  reindeer hides. As she could tell by striking against the hides, the walls were of
                  huge, rough blocks of stone, and from the<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC7182-00000021"/>
                  lack of air, were covered up with earth. There seemed to be no other orifice than
                  the chink in the rocky roof, through which the smoke found an issue, and the door.
                  She lifted aside the skin which hung over the latter, but was met by two
                  glittering lance heads in the hands of a couple of Laps who grinned savagely at
                  her.</p>
               <p>Turning away, she saw in the back part of the den, a huge square mass of stone
                  upon the top of which grinned a squat, distorted idol. The head was rudely
                  fashioned into some semblance of features, and the huge, ugly mouth was filled
                  with bear's teeth and was stained and foul. At the feet of this was a clotted mass
                  of hair and small bits of bone, and at the base of the block was a trench as if to
                  receive the blood (she shuddered as she fancied this) which flowed from above.</p>
               <p>Here then she was, alone with this hideous monster, a prisoner with no hope save
                  in Heaven.</p>
               <p>She heard a rustle behind her, and turned to see Afra.</p>
               <p>"Oh, Afra!" she cried, as she sprang towards her, "what is this? Is it a horrible
                  dream?"</p>
               <p>But the Lap girl motioned her off, and stood gazing at her with eyes full of hate
                  and demoniac scorn.</p>
               <p>"A dream," she said, "yes, a dream, which by the help of Zernebok I wove for you.
                  A dream from which your waking shall be terrible."</p>
               <p>"O Afra! if you love me!——."</p>
               <p>But the Lap interrupted her fiercely, and her slight frame quivered with passion
                  as she spoke.</p>
               <p>"Love you! I <emph>hate</emph> you! with a hatred that your thin white blood
                  cannot even imagine. It was I who stole you from your soft, well-guarded nest. And
                  would you know for what? Listen, You remember the Lap chief, who last summer laid
                  his hands upon your dainty person, and was lashed by your servants with dog-whips
                  out of the place. It was Karnak, chief and priest of Zernebok; Karnak who offers
                  the captives to Zernebok on that altar there. He swore vengeance upon you and upon
                  your people through you, and I—I helped him to gain it."——</p>
               <p>As she paused from the very vehemence of her passion, poor Brenda gasped,</p>
               <p>"Oh, my God! am I to die so horrible a death."</p>
               <p>"Die," screamed the frantic Lap; "hope not for death. Death were no vengeance. No.
                  This was your bridal day; well, you shall have a bridegroom, Karnak! This is his
                  sweet revenge; you shall be his creature, his slave, his toy, until he tires of
                     you,<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC7182-00000022"/> and drives you from his lodge to
                  be the menial of the basest Lap in the land. Scream now to your White Christ and
                  to His Mother and see if they will help you."</p>
               <p>Brenda stood stupified before this frenzied rage, and Afra disappeared with the
                  words,</p>
               <p>"I go to call your bridegroom!"</p>
               <p>Slowly the unfortunate girl sank down upon her knees. "And I feared not even
                  death!" she moaned, "and now these dreadful threats—to me the sworn spouse of
                  Christ!—Mother most pure," she cried, clasping her hands in agony, "Mother most
                  chaste, Mother undefiled, save me! save me from this horror." Then she poured
                  forth her whole soul in the terrible prayer of anguish.</p>
               <p>And as she prayed, there seemed to break forth from the wall before her, a soft
                  pale azure light and the faint semblance of a sweet face, like that in her own
                  chamber at home. It may have been mere imagination, for it faded away, as she felt
                  a hand laid upon her shoulder, and turning, saw the pagan priest. She sprang up to
                  avoid him, but he caught her in his arms. By his foul breathing she knew that he
                  was maddened with <hi rend="i"/>Arki, and she saw the fires of hell burning in his
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"Mother inviolate, save me!" she shrieked, and strove to thrust him from her. Her
                  fingers closed upon the handle of a knife in his breast, and without knowing what
                  she did she drew it forth. As the steel flashed before the eyes of the drunken
                  savage, the course of his passion changed. He seized her arm, wrenched the knife
                  from her grasp, and drove it into her bosom. The red blood spouted forth, and she
                  fell to the ground.</p>
               <p>Mary most pure had saved her.</p>
               <p>At the same instant the whole village rang with fierce war-cries and shrieks of
                  women, and the bloodstained savage darted forth from the cavern with the streaming
                  knife in his hand</p>
               <p>Then Afra entered.</p>
               <p>"Ah," she said, "he has killed you. He has robbed me of half my revenge!"</p>
               <p>"Afra," said the dying girl, as she feebly pressed her robe against the bleeding
                  wound, "Afra, I forgive you. But how could you do this, and to me who loved you
                  so!"</p>
               <p>"How could I do it. Because I hated you, and because I loved Svend Ulfsen. I loved
                  him with the fiery love of the dark-browed Lap; and your pale face witched him
                  from me. And he mocked me and played with me as with a pet dog. This is your
                  bridal day, and here is your wreath. Will you wear it?"</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC7182-00000023"/>
               <p>As she spoke she held up the wreath of misletoe and arbute which Svend had made.
                  Then she tore it fiercely into pieces, and threw them at the prostrate Brenda; and
                  said,</p>
               <p>"Here, take it, wear it. His face will your eyes never see again. How like you
                  your bridal feast?" She paused, and the fierce rage began to abate in her heart,
                  when she saw the look of utter wonderment in Brenda's pure and beautiful eyes. The
                  poor pagan bent her dark face down to hear the feeble voice say,</p>
               <p>"Yes; it was my bridal day, but not with Svend."</p>
               <p>"What do you say," gasped Afra, "was not Svend your bridegroom."</p>
               <p>"My bridegroom," said Brenda, "is my Lord and my Redeemer. He <emph>died</emph>
                  for love of me."</p>
               <p>"But I have heard him and them, all of them, speak of you as a bride; did he not
                  place the bridal crown upon your head? did I not see it there?" said Afra uttering
                  question upon question in a half crazy manner.</p>
               <p>Brenda summoned all her strength for a last effort. "Raise my head, Afra!" she
                  said, "that I may speak to you." Afra, now trembling and awed, obeyed and seating
                  herself, supported the head of the expiring Norse girl on her bosom.</p>
               <p>"I see it now; I understand it all now. He often called me bride, and spoke of my
                  nuptials. I can see too now that he did and said much to tease you Afra; but I did
                  not notice then. I never thought of human love, except my father's and my
                  mother's. From childhood I was the vowed bride of Christ. Do you not remember how
                  I told you of the holy women at Trondheim, the Spouses only of Christ? To-day I
                  was to set out for their convent to begin my year of preparation. But the marriage
                  is nearer now; The Bridegroom is at hand. Would I were more worthy to meet
                  Him."</p>
               <p>Her passion all gone, the reaction come, all jealousy, hatred and anger dispersed
                  to the winds, with a chill like that of death at her heart, Afra sate trembling
                  and supporting the dying girl.</p>
               <p>"But for that," she murmured, "I loved you Brenda, better than my own life. And I
                  have done this."</p>
               <p>Brenda made a last effort.</p>
               <p>"Do not mourn for it now, little sister; I forgive you from my heart of hearts. My
                  Bridegroom died of love for them that slew Him! Afra go thou to Trondheim and be a
                  Christian, wilt thou promise?"</p>
               <p>"If I live," answered a broken voice.</p>
               <p>"See how the light grows, azure and rayed with<pb n="34-35"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000024"/> gold," murmured Brenda. "The pain is gone, my
                  Redeemer and my Spouse, Thou art come!"</p>
               <p>And the pale azure light kindled and spread, till the glory of its ineffable
                  beauty filled the room. The vile idol shivered and fell broken from its altar. The
                  heart of the blue splendor grew deeper; then unfolded within it a glow of tender,
                  starry gold, and Mary, the inviolate Mother, smiled from the midst of the
                  radiance, and stretching out her arms of maternal love, received into her bosom
                  the white, pure soul of Brenda.</p>
               <p>And Afra sate there silent, holding the pale clay.</p>
               <p>There the stern Norsemen found her, when they entered the cavern. But by that time
                  her blood had ceased to flow in the veins of any living creature, Karnak had met
                  them, defied them with his crimsoned knife, and told them whose blood had dyed it.
                  And Magnus Thurlesen spared nothing that he found alive. He fulfilled his terrible
                  oath.</p>
               <p>They asked no questions of Afra. Seeing her with Brenda's pale dead face upon her
                  bosom, they never suspected her guilt; and so they took her with the beloved body
                  home. And when the nuns of Trondheim begged that Brenda might be buried in the
                  cloister of their convent, she followed thither and remained there. She was
                  instructed and baptized, and dwelt there for nearly two years, performing the most
                  menial offices through voluntary humility, until at last one morning when they
                  missed her from the Mass, they found her lying dead in the cloisters with her cold
                  emaciated cheek upon the stone that covered the tomb of Brenda.</p>
               <p>Svend Ulfsen, took service with the Greek Emperor, and died in Joppa on his return
                  from the tomb of Christ. Ave Maria purissima!</p>

               <head>CHILDERIC THE FRANK.</head>
               <p>EVERYBODY knows how Clovis, the wild Frank king swept his enemies before him in
                  twenty stricken fields. Everybody knows also that Clovis was a mortal, and
                  therefore not always successful; besides being a tough pagan, who for years had
                  resisted the arguments and entreaties of his good Queen to burn his idols and to
                  serve the true God.</p>
               <p>Well, by and bye, he lost belief in the idols, without however becoming a
                  Christian, and then he had nothing to believe in but his own prowess and the valor
                  of his troops. These did not always win the day; for at Tolbiac or Zulpich in the
                  Electorate of Cologne, the Germans routed him with great slaughter. And this was
                  the best fortune that ever happened to Clovis, for it broke his pride and haughty
                  self-reliance. He saw his tried and bravest soldiery flying, and that his arm and
                  voice were useless to recall them.</p>
               <p>Then he thought of his good wife, Saint Clothilda, whom perhaps he should see no
                     more;<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC7182-00000028"/> and all the instruction she had
                  given him, and her gentle patience and life of charity and prayer rose up before
                  him through the blood-mists, through the dim dust clouds of the turbulent retreat
                  Then lifting up his voice to the God of the Christians he recognized His power,
                  renounced the false deities he had worshipped, and vowed from that time forward to
                  serve the living and true God and Him alone.</p>
               <p>Then back he dashed into the battle-field with new confidence and courage, and the
                  foe were swept from the field. Returned to Rheims he harrangued his army, and
                  pointed out to them that the glorious field of Tolbiac had been won by help from a
                  Power superior to man's, and they, or the most of them, shouted, "Away with false,
                  perishable deities; we will serve the Immortal alone!" And on Christmas Day, A.D.
                  496, they and he were baptized by Saint Remy. And when Clovis came forth from the
                  Cathedral, he stood there, the only Catholic king at that moment in the world.</p>
               <p>Now, among the great chiefs of Clovis there were none stronger in person, fiercer
                  in battle, more eager in thirst for glory than Childeric, son of Ruaric the Frank.
                  He too had been baptized on the feast of Our Lord's Nativity, but rather because
                  he had a habit of following his king wheresoever he went, than from any very deep
                  conviction or knowledge of the nature of that holy Sacrament. But a christened man
                  he was now, and when King Clovis was distributing rewards to the most
                  distinguished of his followers, he gave to Childeric to wife, a fair young
                  Christian lady in attendance on the Queen, and she brought as her dowry to the
                  stout warrior the domain and Castle of Criel on the sea.</p>
               <p>Brave enough was Childeric, but rough as an ocean storm; but he was loyally
                  devoted to Clovis, and to that one good quality Brenhilda trusted for softening
                  his nature and completing his conversion. Besides, all his followers still
                  remained pagans, and she hoped with the help of Our Lady, <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >Refugium Peccatorum,</foreign> to win their souls over to Christ. And so
                  hopeful and devout she set out with her lord and his wild retinue, and took up her
                  abode in Criel, which frowned from the top of a high rock over the broad Channel
                  upon the southern coasts of Britain.</p>
               <p>Here Childeric busied himself in fortifying his stronghold and in building up a
                  village which clustered at the foot of the Castle rock. This soon became peopled,
                  and as the soldiers had much leisure time, they employed it in fishing, so that
                  they grew as expert in the management of boats as they had ever been with their
                  war horses, and the sea with its perpetual changes grew familiar to them as the
                  land.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC7182-00000029"/>
               <p>Nor did this effeminate these warriors, for in those times the wild Norse vikings
                  or sea-kings were constantly cruising about the Northern seas, and he among the
                  richer Frank fisherman who would keep his boat and crew for his own uses, had
                  often to fight stoutly for it.</p>
               <p>Sometimes indeed the tall children of Thor and Woden would make a descent upon the
                  coast and attack the village, and then Childeric at the head of his men would
                  swoop down from his rock, and the joy of battle would rise again in his heart as
                  he exchanged stout blows with the invaders. By and bye the Crag of Oriel grew so
                  well known as a place where dry blows were more plentiful than booty, that the
                  rovers ceased to land there, and the sword of Childeric got no other polishing
                  than such as the armorers mitten could give it.</p>
               <p>It had been the first care of the lady Brenhilda to set apart a portion of her
                  tower for a chapel, and on this she lavished all her care and taste. It was a
                  lofty vaulted room, with an outlook over the sea, and was dedicated to our Lady
                  Maria Rosa Mystica. In a niche over the little altar stood an image of the
                  "Blessed among Women," holding her God and Child upon her pure bosom, and offering
                  Him the homage of a white rose. There she seemed to stand, serene and merciful,
                  looking out through the tall, narrow casement upon the tossing ocean.</p>
               <p>Here Brenhilda, when her housewife duties were over, or when her lord was absent,
                  loved to kneel and pray, or to sit at the window and look out upon the boats. More
                  than one fierce conflict had she watched from this height, mingling her vigil with
                  prayer, and feeling secure in the protection of her sacred Patroness.</p>
               <p>Only once had she prevailed upon the rough Frank chieftain to visit her oratory,
                  and then ho had only laughed at her for her simple love and faith.</p>
               <p>"Better," he said, "that she should learn to chant war songs to inspirit his
                  liegemen, than to be singing her southern lays to her Teuta, or talking fairy
                  tales with the shaveling Anselm." "Not but that Father Anselm is a good leech," ho
                  added, "and well skilled at healing a sword thrust: but a wild fight-chant over a
                  flagon of red wine with my riders is worth all your piping hymns, dame of
                  mine."</p>
               <p>Now when three or four years had passed by and there came no child to inherit his
                  name or to bind him more fondly to Brenhilda, Childeric began to grow morose in
                  his humor. He spent more and more time in the hall draining the hot red wines of
                     the<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC7182-00000030"/> South, and grew first cold, and
                  then rude and peevish toward his wife. By and bye he seemed positively to hate
                  her, such trouble did he take to annoy and thwart her.</p>
               <p>He mocked constantly at her devotion, turned Father Anselm out of doors, and
                  threatened to hunt him with hounds if he ever came back, and finally talked about
                  taking his carouses in her oratory and compelling her to join them. He ridiculed
                  all that he knew about Christianity, and began to keep the old pagan feasts in the
                  way most agreeable to himself—namely, drinking a little deeper than ordinary.</p>
               <p>Well, when matters were at their worst, he received a summons to join the king in
                  an expedition against the Germans on the border. He went forth gladly to battle,
                  leaving but a slight guard for his castle. Brenhilda saw him go with pleasure; she
                  had hoped that military employment and the society of the Christian king, would at
                  least restore him to his former rough kindness, if it did not even do more for
                  him.</p>
               <p>But it was fated to be far otherwise, for when Childeric joined the Royal troops
                  he was embittered by finding himself and his men the only pagans there. Worse than
                  that, he was considered an apostate, for he had been baptized. So he grew more
                  surly day by day, and at the first reverse which the army of Clovis met with, he
                  dared to upbraid the king with his Christianity.</p>
               <p>"Had'st thou been true," he said "to the gods of thy fathers, they would have
                  fought for thee as of old."</p>
               <p>In vain Clovis asked why they had not done so at Zulpich, and equally in vain were
                  his endeavors to reason with or instruct the wild chief. He grew worse and worse,
                  and after a day or two's sulking, led his men upon parade, wearing the mislctoe
                  fillets and the oak leaves of the heathen worship. Angry at this insult, Clovis
                  sent him word that he had no further need of his services, and Childeric turned
                  away in fury from the Christian camp and hurried back to Oriel by the Sea.</p>
               <p>It was noonday when he reached the towers, and the mid-day meal was the first
                  thing to claim his attention. After that came the carouse, and as he drained
                  flagon after flagon of red wine, and brooded over his disgrace, his soul grew
                  darker and darker within him. Such of his rude officers as dared to speak to him
                  inflamed his wrath by their evil counsels, and at last he sprang to his feet, and
                  vowed by his idols and his sword that he would rid his house of the Christian
                  trash within it.</p>
               <p>Brenhilda heard the ring of his iron heel upon the<pb n="48-49"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000031"/> pavement of the hall as she sate in her oratory and
                  grew pale, for she had learned to tremble now at the sound of his voice or step.
                  Nearer and nearer drew the step, and then the door was burst open by a blow, and
                  flushed and savage he frowned upon her. She would have approached him, but he bade
                  her keep off; and then with fierce tone and, gesture he told her of his disgrace,
                  and of his purpose to restore the. worship of his ancient gods. Her very silence
                  and trembling seemed to make him angrier.</p>
               <p>Every moment he grew more furious, and at last shouting "Away with this Christian
                  stuff!" he spurned the little Altar with his mailed foot, and it fell with its
                  furniture crashing to the ground. Then with his drawn sword he smote the image of
                  Our Lady upon the crowned forehead and dashed it to the floor.</p>
               <p>Brenhilda saw, gave a shriek of horror and fled. Out through the long halls,
                  through the startled soldiery, through the gate, down the steep rock path to the
                  shore of the sea. As she turned the angle of a rock, she found herself suddenly in
                  a knot of tall, wild-looking men, strangely armed, dark haired and bearded. The
                  start gave her a quick revulsion of feeling, the strong excitement which had
                  strengthened her gave way, and she fell senseless to the ground.</p>
               <p>The strange mariners lifted her with gentleness, placed her in their boat which
                  lay bows on upon the beach, and entering it themselves, rowed away out to sea.</p>
               <p>From the window of the Oratory the savage Childeric had watched the descent of the
                  lady Brenhilda down the steep cliff road, and had seen her disappear round the
                  rock upon the sands. Some minutes afterwards he saw a boat rowed out from shore,
                  although it was too far below him to discover what or who was in it. Out at sea he
                  saw the glancing of a white sail, and could see that the boat was heading in that
                  direction. There he stood for a long time until the object of his watch lessened
                  to a mere speck upon the broad blue waters.</p>
               <p>Then a strange eerie feeling seized upon him. He would not confess it to be fear
                  even to himself, but it was something very like it. A chill crept over him, and
                  then an irrepressible shudder made him quiver. He felt a strange desire to look
                  again upon the image he had smitten. He turned from the window for that purpose.
                  There lay the ruins of the little altar, its crushed vases and broken candles
                  mingled confusedly with the scattered flowers; but the statue was gone. He looked
                     for<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC7182-00000032"/> it in vain, and again the chill
                  and shudder passed through him as he left the desecrated room.</p>
               <p>Once back in the great hall, he despatched two of his men to look for their lady
                  and then threw himself moodily into the great oak chair which stood at the head of
                  the vast table. There he sate in sullen silence until the men returned, and said
                  that their search had been in vain, and that some of the fishermen had seen a boat
                  of Norse pirates leaving the shore in which was a woman either fainting or dead.
                  He bade them leave him, and sate still there until the shadows crept darkly into
                  the hall as the sun went down. Then entering as it were with the dusk, the image
                  of Our Lady came and stood before him. A deep wound was on the broad, low
                  forehead; the rose was broken from the hand, and the sweet eyes, full of reproach,
                  were fixed upon him. Still, sad and fixed, as is the look of an image, those eyes
                  confronted his.</p>
               <p>He hid his face in his hands, but the knowledge of the Presence compelled him to
                  look up and meet the set mournful gaze. He sprang from his chair towards it, but
                  as he gained his feet it was gone. Nothing was visible in the hall but-the shadows
                  that lengthened and darkened as the twilight deepened into night He shouted then
                  for torches and wine. They were brought; the table was spread, and the ordinary
                  revel commenced and was prolonged into the night At length worn out but fevered he
                  sought his bed, and as he closed his eyes the image stood before him; in vain he
                  covered his face and wrapped his head in the close drapery, the sad eyes found his
                  own through all.</p>
               <p>If he awoke and started up he saw nothing, but with sleep the vision returned.
                  Then he knew what it was to be haunted forever by Reproach for evil done.</p>
               <p>For some time it was only during inaction that the vision attended the wild
                  Childeric, and ho began to think at last that a more stirring life would drive it
                  away altogether. So he formed a grand hunting party, and prepared to make that his
                  chief occupation. At that time France was covered with forest, and the wolf, the
                  wildboar and the stag abounded there. So there was plenty of game for the spear of
                  the rude Frank. So with his men he set out for the appointed place, and with shout
                  and sound of horn the game was soon aroused, and swift through the odorous forest
                  dashed the wild troop. While busy thus, he forgot all the past and was conscious
                  only of feeling the hunter's joyous excitement. But when the stag was run down and
                  lay bleeding and dying before him it turned its large brown eyes to his, and with
                  that look rose up the image with the<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC7182-00000033"/> scar
                  upon the forehead, and the dolorous gaze of Mary whom he had outraged chilled him
                  again.</p>
               <p>For in this look there was none of that tenderness and sweet pity which we love to
                  find in our dear Mother's pure eyes; but only a stony changeless reproach
                  unendurably fixed. He remained in the forest for eight or ten days, but the result
                  of every chase was the same. His appetite forsook him, and though he drank deeply
                  it gave him no relief.</p>
               <p>"By the gods," he said at last, "this warfare on the brutes is useless, I must try
                  the clash of armor for a medicine and let a little blood flow. Perhaps it may cool
                  this fever."</p>
               <p>War was easily obtainable in those days, for the frontiers of the new kingdom of
                  Clovis were perpetually harrassed by the German tribes, and thither accordingly
                  Childeric led his retinue. But in the battle as in the chase the result was ever
                  the same. Every blow he struck brought up the Image before him. He could drive it
                  away while attending to the affairs of the camp or while busied only in commanding
                  in the fray, but as certainly as he himself engaged, and his huge sword rose and
                  fell, so certainly were the reproachful eyes fixed upon his own.</p>
               <p>One day when fortune declared against the Franks and they broke and retired before
                  the fierce onset of the Germans, the tide was changed by the arrival of a
                  Christian cohort from the troops of Clovis. Again they formed and advanced, the
                  new comers leading the van, and again the charge of the Germans broke their ranks,
                  and threw them into disorder. As they wavered, their banner was lost and carried
                  far into the midst of the foe.</p>
               <p>Childeric was as brave as he was savage, and grew wild at sight of this. He dashed
                  among the retreating Franks, reanimated them by shout and prayer or even
                  sword-blow. He instilled into them at last his own burning battle-thirst, and
                  filled with fury and with shame, they dashed forward to the recovery of their
                  banner. Childeric hewed his way through the thickest of the press and so
                  stimulated the others by his energetic courage that they broke through the German
                  resistance and regained the day. Just at that moment a breeze caught the folds of
                  the banner, around which was the hottest struggle, and spread them out clearly.
                  There upon the silken field was painted the same figure of Maria Rosa Mystica;
                  from the silken field looked those fixed reproachful eyes.</p>
               <p>As Childeric dropped his sword-point at the sight, the mace of a huge Teuton
                  warrior descended upon his helmet and hurled him senseless to the ground.</p>
               <pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC7182-00000034"/>
               <p>He awoke to a dim sense of great pain. His head was dizzy and his whole body stiff
                  with wounds and cold. He seemed to recognize that some one was examining his
                  condition, and touching him with gentle hands; then he was lifted upon a sort of
                  litter and carried away; but his sensations were like those in a dream, and he
                  swooned entirely from loss of blood before his bearers reached their destination.
                  On his recovery, he found himself stretched upon a soft couch of moss and sweet
                  scented herbs, in a sort of grotto or open cell He could see a sort of rude altar
                  and a crucifix, and when he moaned it was a Christian religious as he knew by the
                  cowl and beads who brought him drink, and finding him strong enough examined and
                  redressed his wounds.</p>
               <p>Several days passed before he was out of danger of death, but that crisis once
                  passed, his nurse who had hitherto required and kept strict silence permitted him
                  to talk.</p>
               <p>"Where am I," asked the Chief, and who art thou who dealest so tenderly with me? I
                  owe my life to thee doubtless.</p>
               <p>"You are in a consecrated cell, 59 was the answer, "and with one who is bound to
                  treat you tenderly, your old friend and servant Anselm."</p>
               <p>The blood rushed to the warrior's face with shame at receiving such tender care
                  from one whom he had so rudely dealt with; but the kindness of the good monk soon
                  relieved him. Long was the illness of Childeric, for his wounds were many and
                  severe, but long as it was, he rose from it full of thankfulness; for God had made
                  use of it to save his soul.</p>
               <p>At first he listened to Father Anselm patiently, only because he was bound in
                  gratitude not to offend him; but soon respect grew upon him for the sublime
                  doctrines themselves, and, then, as the beautiful legends of the Gospel were
                  related and explained to him, love filled his heart with warmth and light from
                  Heaven. And then came faith. Hope lingered last of all; for bitter remorseful
                  penitence kept her long from his soul. But at last his penitence grew hopeful, and
                  he issued from the cell of Father Anselm another being. His armor and huge sword
                  were suspended from the rock walls of the grotto, and clad in a long, grey robe
                  and with a staff in his hand, he set out on foot for Oriel by the Sea.</p>
               <p>Pausing at Rheims he gladdened the hearts of Saint Remy, Clovis and Saint
                  Clothilde by his conversion, and then continued his journey.</p>
               <p>He reached his castle, and went first to Brenhilda's oratory. There lay the ruins
                  of the little altar as before, but discolored now with dust and covered with<pb
                     n="56-57" xml:id="VAC7182-00000035"/> the webs of many a busy spider. As he
                  knelt down to pray, he recalled his gentle wife; how it was in this spot she used
                  to pray for him; how patiently she endured his fierce moodiness and how she had no
                  friends on this wild sea-side crag save God and Mary, of whom he would have robbed
                  her had he been able. He would have given worlds for the gift of tears, but his
                  eyes were parched and hot: "never," he thought as he beat his breast, "never shall
                  those sweet dews fall for me."</p>
               <p>He rose and walked to the window and stood there as he had stood a year ago
                  looking out along the crag, and down the winding path and over the cold blue sea.
                  He starts. Then rubs his fevered eyes and looks intently toward the beach. The
                  Image of Our Lady is there; the Presence which has left him since he fell upon the
                  field has returned; he can see the eyes as plainly as if he were close beside
                  them. They are not so fixed, not so reproachful and statue like; they are kind,
                  and have a soft living and even loving light in them They seem to beckon and draw
                  him.</p>
               <p>"I come," he says, "Oh, my Queen and Lady! Anywhere, so that I may win thy pardon
                  and thy Son's."</p>
               <p>Alone, and without speaking to any one in the Castle, he passed out through the
                  postern gate, along the cliff, down the steep path, and on the yellow beach. He
                  saw her eyes again, and they grew, he thought still gentler as the Image floated
                  away seawards over the surface of the waters. A small boat lay upon the sands. He
                  pushed it off; loosed the sail, and swept out from the shore in the track of the
                  sacred Image.</p>
               <p>The sun went down in the far-off West, and the dews fell heavily, and the stars
                  filled the purple heavens with mellow light. And they too faded, and the grey and
                  crimson dawn succeeded, and the sun arose and set again, and the dews and the
                  stars in their silent course. And on the third night, he was faint and weary, and
                  knew only that he was alone in his little boat upon the wide sea. He fastened the
                  lug of his sail to the tiller of the helm, crossed himself, and having prayed
                  fervently sank down exhausted into deep sleep.</p>
               <p>When he awoke, he was no longer in the frail skiff, but on the deck of a stout
                  caravel. Around him moved tall, bearded men, some in armor. Huge swords and spears
                  and battle-axes were ranged around the masts and along portions of the bulwark of
                  the vessel. The speech in which they addressed each other was unknown to him, but
                  he saw enough to guess that he was on board the ship of a viking or Norse
                  sea-rover. Then he knew that his penance<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC7182-00000036"/>
                  was begun in earnest. He was soon aroused from his thoughts, and a place given
                  him, with a sign and blow, among the slaves, whom he knew to be such by their
                  short hair and shaved faces.</p>
               <p>That blow was the first that Childeric had ever received out of battle, and the
                  boiling blood rushed to his head. But as he gathered himself to spring at the
                  throat of the Norseman, he saw the eyes of the Mystical Rose beaming upon his, and
                  the mails: upon her forehead was red. He bowed his erected head in deepest
                  humility? signed the pride from his heart with the sign of the meek Crucified, and
                  received the insult as coming from his Father's loving and beloved hand.</p>
               <p>He had abundant opportunity for practising his newly learned virtues, for the
                  cruise of the Northmen was long and often interrupted. They sailed down the
                  Western coast of France and Portugal, passed the pillared strait of Hercules and
                  so up the Mediterranean. Many a village on the coast they visited and sometimes
                  pillaged, and when the booty was brought on board, and the wine and mead of
                  rejoicing mounted to the brain of the pirates, Childeric and his fellows were
                  visited by many a blow and spoken insult He had learned enough of their own
                  language to understand how keen was their scorn and contempt But he bore all
                  patiently, uniting his sorrows with those of his Redeemer, and offering all to the
                  Eternal Father.</p>
               <p>But still the dry fever burned in his eye, when, with all the tenderness he could
                  feel, he retraced the sufferings of our Lord; when with broken heart he offered
                  the indignities he endured penitentially unto Him; when he recalled his Brenhilda
                  and how meekly she had borne with him, and his own cruelties to her, he would pray
                  that he might weep. But the solace of tears was denied him; the eyes that had
                  looked fiercely or coldly upon the wounded forehead of Our Lady's image were now
                  dry and burning. He saw his poor comrades weep as they recalled their youth and
                  homes, and envied them their tears. But this also he took as his deserved
                  punishment.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the ship sailed on, past the warm shores of Spain and vine-clad Gaul,
                  past ancient Sicily and Italy and Greece, and now she was holding her course
                  Southwards across the sea. They neared the Egyptian coast at last, and anchoring
                  off the land sent some of their officers on shore. Then it was made known what was
                  the destined terminus of their voyage. The slaves, except such as were absolutely
                  necessary were to be sold here, and then the Norsemen were to make their way to
                  Byzantium, and offer their battle-axes to the great Emperor.</p>
               <pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC7182-00000037"/>
               <p>Among those who were sent on shore was Childeric. He was sold, and with a party of
                  unfortunates like himself was taken by a long and painful march to Alexandria; and
                  there amid a new people, understanding and understood by none, the once haughty
                     <foreign xml:lang="LAT">Comes</foreign> of King Clovis became a thrall.</p>
               <p>A year passed by in the most laborious and humblest labor, all gently and
                  patiently endured. Sometimes his virtue seemed about to fail; he was young yet,
                  and the wild Frank blood was hot in him; he was a soldier too, and it required no
                  small effort to take insult with meekness, but when his strength seemed about to
                  forsake him, the Image of the Rosa Mystica appeared to him and gave him new
                  courage and resolution. The old cold, reproachful look had passed away from the
                  beautiful pure eyes. At every visit they grew sweeter and more lovingly pardoning
                  in their expression, and their wondrous tenderness so touched his heart at times
                  that he thought it would break with sorrow for its past offences, and still more
                  he wished for the grace of tears, but that, in God's loving wisdom, was yet denied
                  him.</p>
               <p>But the end of his penance was approaching. As he had learned Norse on the sea, so
                  here in his slavery he had acquired Greek, and he had made a friend of an old
                  slave, who like himself had a great devotion to our dear Lady, and whom he used to
                  meet in the churches and at the shrines. One day something led the conversation to
                  Childeric's conversion, many circumstances of which he related to his friend, and
                  he spoke of his fair land of Gaul, which he could never hope to see again.</p>
               <p>Then the old man told him that he too had been a pagan until recently, and that
                  being stricken with fever he was nursed by a female slave, who also was a Gaul He
                  told how she too had been brought by a pirate ship, and spoke of her great beauty
                  marred though it were by greater suffering; but above all, he praised her
                  gentleness, and the courageous fidelity with which she had nursed him, and the
                  tender zeal with which she had led him to the faith of Christ At last, for some
                  notable service, she had been set free, and had joined a band of pilgrims for the
                  Holy Land, where our Redeemer died, and had set out with them not long before
                  Childeric's arrival. Night and day, the old man said, did he pray to the Panagia
                  for Brenhilda, who, he added, had been a great lady in her own land.</p>
               <p>Ah, how those fevered tearless eyelids burned as the Frank chief covered them with
                  his hands! How he wondered that he could not weep to hear of that sweet wife, so
                  loved, so honored here, whom<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC7182-00000038"/> he had
                  driven into this cruel bondage and toil and lonely sorrow. "Oh stainless Virgin,
                  Mother of God!" he moaned, "why can I not weep!"</p>
               <p>From this time he had but one thought, how to follow the footsteps of Brenhilda
                  into Palestine. So he prayed unto Our Lord as to One who had also been an exile in
                  Egypt, and he was mercifully heard. There was an annual redemption of captives in
                  Alexandria then, and he by his master's recommendation was one of the chosen this
                  year. The very morning after his enfranchisement, fortified by the Divine Food, he
                  left the Church of Our Lady, and with wallet upon his back and staff in his hand
                  he set out on his journey.</p>
               <p>We will not follow him through all that long march. It was painful and wearisome,
                  but hope supported him. It was on the Eve of the Feast of Christ's Nativity that
                  he saw a luminous mist which he supposed to indicate the lights of Jerusalem. He
                  was almost completely exhausted, and was walking now in a desert place. Only a few
                  leafless thorny shrubs broke the outline of rough plain; his eyes seemed on fire
                  with the sun of the day which had now gone down; and as in the dim light he walked
                  along, the flints with which the ground was covered lacerated his unshod feet at
                  every step.</p>
               <p>Some distance before him grew a single palm. He would struggle on to that he
                  thought, and he down beneath it to rest. Perhaps Our Lord with His dear Mother and
                  Saint Joseph had reposed under its shadow when they fled unto Egypt from the
                  threats of Herod. He went on bravely over the unlovely desert, but as he drew
                  nearer to the tree, it seemed that the flints grew sharper and cut more keenly.
                  Blood flowed at every stop, and he only tottered when the shadow of the foliage on
                  the ground made him look up.</p>
               <p>Beneath the tree, there was a little altar, of familiar look and shape, and before
                  it knelt a woman in prayer. And upon it was an Image of Mary: but the rose was
                  restored in her hand, the mark had disappeared from the forehead, and from her
                  eyes shone, directly into his, the light of perfect forgiveness and benignity and
                  love. Then the rocky fountains of his heart were broken up, and the tears burst
                  forth; they poured into those feverish eyes like balm, and, as he fell upon his
                  knees and stretched his arms, they rained upon the desert like a summer
                  shower.</p>
               <p>And where the penitential blood had poured from his wounded feet, sprang up red
                  roses and clothed the desert with their bloom; and where the tears of contrition
                  had fallen, pure white roses unfolded their stainless petals and shook out their
                     fragrance<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC7182-00000039"/> beneath the soft Judean
                  star-light He saw that Brenhilda had risen and was approaching him, and he saw the
                  Holy Child raise His little hand and bestow a benediction from His throne upon the
                  bosom of the Mystical Rose.</p>

               <p>THE gauzy grey mist covered the world. Pulseless almost and silent slept the
                  Mediterranean, Only the lightest ripple sought the shore and crept up with low
                  musical murmur on the beach and flowed away again. Bathing the South where the
                  pyramids shadow the mysterious sands; creeping up past Joppa where the fleets of
                  Solomon the Magnificent, laden with gold and ivory, were wont to furl their weary
                  wings; touching the walls of Acre where Lion-hearted Richard of England rebuked
                  the crowned Crusaders for their coldness of heart; washing the ruins of Tyre whose
                  "merchants were princes, whose traffickers were the honorable of the earth;"
                  flowing between chivalric Cyprus and the point of Cape Madonna, past shores whose
                  sands are history and isles whose names are song.</p>
               <p>It kissed that sacred Land, which Moses saw but might not enter; which martial
                  Joshua won. The land where Barak fought and Sisera fell, and Ruth walked gleaning
                  through the golden grain; where rapt Isaiah sang, and Judas fought, and David
                  ruled; where the shadow of Emmanuel was thrown upon the amber bosom of the Jordan,
                  and His feet left their imprinton the shores of Galilee.</p>
               <p>And far in the East rose the breeze of the morning and swept, odorously sighing,
                  towards the sea. It shook the crescent standard on the towers of Jerusalem; it
                  crisped the cool waters of the awakening Gennesareth; and it rustled in the cedars
                  which shadow with perpetual green the heights of immemorial Libanus. And the gauzy
                  grey mist passed away.</p>
               <p>Then the dark clouds that lay here and there on the line of the Orient horizon,
                  grew dusky red like the color of iron-rust; then up into Heaven shot the
                  glittering lances of the royal sun, and amid pomp of bannered clouds, and sudden
                  harmony of birds and deep melodious murmurs from the awaking world, the King of
                  the Day marched forth into the heaven, and wrapt in the sheen of his glory the
                  hills and the isles and the sea.</p>
               <p>At Cape Madonna a large brook flows into the sea. But it is fed by the melting of
                  the snows on Libanus. Half way up the side of the mountain where its channel is
                  worn, stood the little Church, and the people of the village had assisted at
                     Mass,<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7182-00000043"/> and were now defiling down the
                  mountain. On the platform in front of the Church, stood a young girl and an old
                  woman who might have been her nurse. They were watching the procession as it moved
                  downward with the sunlight glinting upon the picturesque dresses, the white
                  floating veils and the occasional arms of the men.</p>
               <p>The young girl was tall, slender and lithe, with all the dark beauty of the pure
                  Syrian race, but her face was very remarkable for a singular expression of serious
                  although gentle resolution. The eyes were thoughtful and what is called dreamy in
                  expression, a look vulgarly thought to denote lack of practicality, but which
                  really shows only a disposition to observe and meditate. From her station she was
                  at length recalled by a voice behind her.</p>
               <p>"The blessing of the morning be upon thee, my child!"</p>
               <p>It was the priest, who had finished his thanksgiving and now came forth from the
                  Church. He was a very old man, with a pleasant gentle face, and a long saintly,
                  silver beard falling upon his breast. The young girl and her companion advanced
                  and kissed his hand.</p>
               <p>"We have brought some fruits to aid your breakfast, Father," said the girl, "haste
                  Mariam and arrange the table."</p>
               <p>The table was a stationary one of cedar, set with a rustic seat beneath the shadow
                  of a mulberry tree, now in full leaf, and with its luscious berries just tinged by
                  the sun with purple. From a low branch hung the iron plate which serves for a
                  church bell in those regions. The old woman spread a snow-white napkin upon the
                  table, and then took from her basket, fresh figs, bananas, grapes, and a golden
                  melon. A boy brought out rolls of the thin bread of the Lebanon from the priest's
                  house, which adjoined the church, and the simple Oriental meal was ready.</p>
               <p>The old priest blessed the food and sate down; the young girl half knelt beside
                  him, Mariam stood ready to wait upon his wants, and the mellow sunshine filtered
                  through the mulberry leaves and fell in sunny patches upon the group.</p>
               <p>The Abouna ate in silence, and when his simple wants were satisfied, he turned to
                  the girl and said,</p>
               <p>"Well, Anna, child of my heart, are you for a new meditation this morning? How far
                  have we gone in the Litany."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Father! have you forgotten already? What did I bring you yesterday?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, child, now I remember,, you brought a chaplet of roses for the Blessed
                  Virgin, and yester-<pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC7182-00000044"/> day we spoke of the
                  Mystical Rose. To-day, then, we have——?</p>
               <p>"Tower of David! And that means strength and protection, does it not, my
                  father?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Anna, and now what shall I say to thee more than that."</p>
               <p>"A little sermon, Father, like the others, so that the memory of it may fill the
                  day. Ah, if you knew how pleasantly they make both sport and labor pass, those
                  holy thoughts. No matter what I am doing, I recall some one of your expressions
                  and then go dreaming about it in my own childish way, and so I keep with Mother
                  Mary all the day, and in my sleep and dreams at night she comes sometimes to me
                  like what I have been fancying her while awake. Now, Father."</p>
               <p>"Well, then, child of my heart, that name is taken from the Holy Scripture, from
                  the Song of King Solomon the Magnificent and Wise. He whose white winged fleets
                  used to cut the blue waters of the ocean there at our feet, and whose workmen
                  sought our mountain forests for cedars for the Temple at Jerusalem.</p>
               <p>"He sang of Christ the great eternal Spouse, and of the Church His Bride; of
                  Christ the head, and of the Church His body mystical. And as the body blood flows
                  through the neck up to the head, so do the Church's prayers, through Mary, pass to
                  our immaculate Lord. Strong in its intercession is that Neck, strong as the tower
                  that royal David reared, and based, like that, on the immemorial Rock. That of
                  hewn stone, cunningly piled; and this compact of all sweet virtues, bound in one,
                  and perfect by her sacred Motherhood.</p>
               <p>"The poet king went forth to war and won the shields of thousand enemies, and
                  these he strung on high around his battlements, and made his tower thrice strong.
                  So Mary goes to war and conquers souls and makes them friends, and writes their
                  titles down for lofty thrones on high; and all their prayers, their shields and
                  armor, go to strengthen hers, till stately, on the jewelled walls of Heaven, the
                  mystic Tower of David stands sublime, a refuge and a shelter for the world.</p>
               <p>"Run thither, O my child, should man or fiend assail thy soul or body; for 'tis
                  there that thy best bulwark is. Now let us kneel and say Ave Maria."</p>
               <p>They knelt down and repeated the beautiful little prayer, and the priest blessed
                  the young Syrian, and she, accompanied by her attendant, went down the hill side
                  to her village.</p>
               <p>She and her brother, a boy of twelve, were orphans. Their father, a man of some
                  wealth, had been killed in the Druse insurrection of 1845, and<pb n="76-77"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000045"/> their mother, wounded by a lance thrust at the same
                  time, had lingered two or three years as an invalid and then expired, leaving them
                  to the care of their old nurse on earth and the protection of our Lady in
                  Heaven.</p>
               <p>From this good mother, and from her nurse Mariam, Anna had drawn from early
                  childhood a profound sense of Mary's power and goodness, and was completely
                  devoted to her. Educated, as far as her education went, by Abouna Bartolmeo, she
                  had long considered him as her father and only guide, and rarely did a day pass
                  without an early visit to him. How they improved those visits, we have already
                  seen.</p>
               <p>So down through the mulberry shadow and the golden sunshine, walked the child of
                  the Libanus to her home, in the village. The men as they went to their silk trees
                  greeted her with a blessing, and the women at the doorways smiled and nodded as
                  she passed. For the orphan was not only beloved for her own sake and that of her
                  parents, but being considered as especially under the protection of Madonna, a
                  sort of tender reverence mingled with their love, and she was known among all the
                  Maronites of the district by the name of the Lily of Lebanon.</p>
               <p>She was greeted by her brother, a gentle delicate boy, and entering her house,
                  went pleasantly about the customary duties of the day.</p>
               <p>So the day declined on Syria. The sun sank down far westward of the Gaditanian
                  strait, and the grey shadows crept over the dark blue sea, and mounted gradually
                  up the hills. The hum of the insect world began; the lights began to sparkle in
                  the dusk; one moment only the highest peaks of Lebanon shone with a burnished
                  purple lustre; and then the grey veil of the twilight fell upon those also.</p>
               <p>Only for a few minutes, for the full orbed moon rose red, and as she soared grew
                  paler and more pure, until she reached the heights of the mid azure and poured a
                  flood of silver upon the earth.</p>
               <p>But long ere this, the taper was extinguished in the house of Anna, the last
                  prayer said, and the Lily of Lebanon slept the pure sleep of innocence.</p>
               <p>Does the Blessed Mother come to her in dreams to-night, or when the first deep
                  sleep is over, and the mind begins to feel the influence of the morning and to
                  wander in vision? And what shall awaken her? the beams of the sun streaming
                  through her window? the song of birds? or a gun from some vessel below on the
                  sea?</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC7182-00000046"/>
               <p>Hark to that shriek as it pierces, agonized and sharp, through the hush of the
                  night! The young girl starts up. A red glare fills her chamber She springs to the
                  little window of her room, and behold on every peak of Lebanon burns a fierce red
                  beacon fire. Alas, she knows too well what they mean.</p>
               <p>And then fierce and fast are heard the shrieks of terror and anguish from women,
                  until the whole village rings again. With these horrid sounds mingle curses of
                  angry men, and swift, sharp rattling of musketry, the ring of iron hoof and the
                  clash of iron blades. The Druses, Moslems, devil-worshippers or whatever they may
                  be, have risen to burn and to destroy.</p>
               <p>Anna's first thought was for her brother. Hastily she dressed herself, and with a
                  brief, earnest prayer, she went to his, room. He, too, was up and clothing himself
                  hurriedly, and turned his face pale with affright towards her.</p>
               <p>"What is it, sister?"</p>
               <p>The Druses, Yuseff, quick, child, dress! and then wait here till I return."</p>
               <p>She ran to the door and looked out. A lurid blaze first attracted her eyes, and
                  looking up she saw the church pouring forth volumes of smoke and sparks and fiery
                  tongues of flame. Almost without intention she ran in that direction, but in a few
                  yards she stumbled and fell; her hand instinctively stretched out, plashed in a
                  warm, thick pool, and when she held it up it streamed with crimson in the
                  moonlight She had fallen over the body of one of the first victims.</p>
               <p>As she stood there shuddering and in doubt, old Mariam approached her, crying
                  out—</p>
               <p>"Why dost thou stand here, O my daughter! Away, for the men of blood, the enemies
                  of God are upon us. Look not up yonder at the Church, the Abouna lies dead under
                  the mulberry tree with his white head cleft by a battle-axe. Fly; fly!"</p>
               <p>Then came the roar of the charge but a few yards from where they stood, and from
                  which a line of low houses was all that separated them. And the screams of the
                  victims pierced the girl's ears, and the shots of the fighters and the cries of
                  the murderers, a Down with the Christian dogs! Smite, stab, trample from the grey
                  beard to the babe at the breast No mercy to the worshippers of Issa!"</p>
               <p>"They will be here in another instant," said Mariam. "Away!"</p>
               <p>"Yuseff! get my brother first," cried Anna, and ran swiftly towards the house. The
                  boy stood within the doorway trembling.</p>
               <p>"Come, Yuseff; thy hand! quick child!"</p>
               <p>"Sister, I am afraid."</p>
               <pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC7182-00000047"/>
               <p>"Afraid, and thou a warrior's son! Come; come!"</p>
               <p>And away from the home of their childhood, never more to see it, fled the young
                  Christians. And as they gained the first turning, a troop of Druses dashed into
                  the place, and with oaths and fierce laughter, plundered and fired the house.</p>
               <p>As she ran on, the Syrian girl recalled brokenly the thoughts that had occupied
                  her through the day, and made of each a prayer, to the Tower of David, to the
                  strong one, the refuge, the defence, the impregnable shelter. But for this and the
                  courage it gave her, she might have gone mad, for her feet plashed in blood as she
                  sped through the quarter of the village first attacked by the Druses.</p>
               <p>Here lay a man with the sword still clutched in his stiffening fingers, and the
                  dark frown of battle freezing upon his brow: there, pierced with a lance, and with
                  its broken shaft protruding from her bosom, lay a mother, with her dead child half
                  cut in two by a sabre stroke clasped to her cold dead heart. Now she avoided the
                  shattered grey head of an elder of the village; now sprang up, to escape from
                  treading on the body of a girl of her own age, who lay in the very kennel, her
                  white robe stained with crimson, and her rich masses of black silken hair clotted
                  and defiled with blood.</p>
               <p>Some half dozen Druses rode into the street behind them. She heard their devilish
                  yells, "There go three dogs of Christians!" and she heard the crack of their
                  carbines, and felt the breath of the bullets as they whistled by her face. With a
                  frightful shriek old Mariam threw up her hands and fell dead. A cry to her
                  patroness from Anna was answered by a sudden inspiration. She too fell down among
                  a number of dead bodies, and dragged her brother with her.</p>
               <p>"Lie still as if dead!" she whispered to him.</p>
               <p>The pursuers shouted as they saw the three fall, and dashed up. One struck at her
                  with his lance as he passed, but his horse swerved at her form, and the weapon
                  struck the ground between her side and her arm. Then shouts and quick firing,
                  which showed that the Maronites had gathered and were offering resistance, called
                  away the troop.</p>
               <p>Then the girl rose again.</p>
               <p>"Up; Yuseff, up! Pray to thy mother, Mary! we shall yet, by her help, escape."</p>
               <p>They gained the edge of the village, and fled out upon the mountain road that
                  leads down unto the sea. Fast as their feet could carry them they fled; but not
                  unseen. Two Druses caught the gleam of the white dress, and turned their horses in
                     pursuit.<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC7182-00000048"/> The Lily of Lebanon heard the
                  tramp of the iron heels, and then the boy fell headlong.</p>
               <p>"Sister, I can not run any further; I am worn out."</p>
               <p>A few more bounds of the wild mountain horses and the murderers would be upon
                  them. Then Anna knelt and closed her eyes, and said—</p>
               <p>" Oh, Mother Mary! receive our souls and bear them to the feet of thy Son and our
                  Redeemer!"</p>
               <p>Yuseff sprang up.</p>
               <p>"See, Anna; see," he cried, "the lady beckons to us; quick, sister! we are
                  saved."</p>
               <p>She looked where the boy pointed, and saw indeed a lady in the Maronite Catholic
                  dress standing in the doorway of a huge strong antique tower, close at the
                  roadside. She had only time to notice its vast square form and massive masonry as
                  she and Yuseff rushed towards it; so close were the assassins that she fancied she
                  could feel the breath of the snorting horses.</p>
               <p>"Thy lance, Ali," shouted one, "spit her with thy lance."</p>
               <p>Hand in hand with Yuseff, she bounded into the open door; heard the clang as its
                  massive frame was dashed to, and the clash of the huge iron bolts as they shot
                  into their staples. Then with a cry of gratitude she sank senseless on the
                  floor.</p>
               <p>The lance of the Druse struck the door as it closed.</p>
               <p>"They have, escaped us Abou Shein!" said one of the baffled villains.</p>
               <p>"Not yet, O Ali. Doubtless there are many of the dogs here. I saw the flash of
                  jewels on the woman's breast as she stood at the open door. Away back to the
                  troop, bring half a dozen men, and we will soon see what is inside here."</p>
               <p>The man called Ali obeyed. And then Abou Shein watched him until he disappeared
                  amid the smoke and flame of the ruined village. And then he thought—</p>
               <p>"If I could get an entrance before they come, I might, find something worth while.
                  Look about thee, Abou Shein, and try."</p>
               <p>He turned and looked; but was petrified with amazement. There was no tower there!
                  Nothing but the rough broken mountain side, towering up hundreds of feet above
                  him; overgrown with scrub cedar and tangled vines, and rock as primitive and rude
                  as when its peaks were left bare by the waters of the abating deluge. This and no
                  other thing met the astonished stare of Abou Shein.</p>
               <p>"Mashallah! this is no place for me!" and setting spurs to his horse, he gallopped
                  oil to tell his wonderful story to his comrades in crime.</p>

               <p>But in Paris, at the Convent of Our Lady of Victories, some few months after, the
                  Sisters were grouped round the young Syrian novice as she related to them,, by
                  command of the Superior, the history of her miraculous escape, through the help of
                  the Tower of David.</p>

               <head>THE HOUSE OF GOLD.</head>
               <p>A BROOK ran forth from the shadows of a forest, wound through the plain and
                  disappeared in the distance. Standing on the bank, you saw, some hundred yards
                  off, a huge, shapeless building, or rather collection of oddities made into a
                  dwelling place. Here a church-yard cross leaned against and propped a tottering
                  wall; one gable shewed half a ruinous spire, another a newly-painted wren-house;
                  one end was Gothic, another Grecian, except that part of the portico of the latter
                  was built up in plain red brick, with Venetian blinds, and a door with knocker,
                  plate, and bell The first window, lancet shaped, shewed the Parable of the
                  Prodigal Son in stained glass; the second was square and glazed with French plate.
                  Then came a Catharine wheel, partly glazed and partly filled with oiled paper, and
                  next to that was a four-paned amorphous sash, principally closed with old garments
                  which fluttered in the breeze.</p>
               <p>A rustic, shingle-roofed balcony ran along the<pb n="88-89"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000051"/> front until it was stopped by a series of square
                  capped Egyptian buttresses, upon the key-stones of which was sculptured the winged
                  orb; and this in its turn was continued into an Italian terrace-railing made of
                  stucco.</p>
               <p>In front of the grounds was a rail fence, the gate whereof was a triumphal arch of
                  Caen stone, richly sculptured and crested with the equestrian statue of a warrior
                  king, and a wooden shed, painted pink, was erected over this to protect it from
                  the elements.</p>
               <p>And at every outlet of this establishment people were perpetually pouring out and
                  in; moving, with all their furniture, from one set of rooms to another; changing
                  the whole style of an apartment, and when that was done, moving out of it. And the
                  uproar of restlessness, quarreling, noisy reconciliation and fresh dispute made it
                  like a Babel. Add to this, that the whole edifice never, coadherent in its parts
                  was so shaken by the uproar, that it threatened to tumble every minute. Several
                  attempts had been made to hold it together by passing a straw-rope several times
                  round it; but that had been broken in fifty places at the first jar, and now hung
                  here and there snaky, rotten and ugly.</p>
               <p>Four children came out of this building, and ran down towards the grassy shore of
                  the brook. The first was a boy of sixteen, tall for his age, well formed and
                  lithe; with clustering chestnut curls and great, flashing dark eyes. He bounded
                  along like a stag, and left the others behind. A girl of twelve followed him more
                  slowly. She bore a resemblance to her brother, but all the tints were lighter and
                  cooler, her hair was straight and smooth, and her eyes of light hazel were
                  steadfast and clear as a falcon's.</p>
               <p>And behind these, came hand in hand, a boy of fourteen and a child but seven or
                  eight years old. The boy was a mild, calm-browed yet resolute looking fellow;
                  neat, and a thought particular in his dress, and very quiet and pleasant in voice
                  and manner. He showed great fondness for the child whom he lead along, and who
                  merited it if judged by her face. Pier features were regular, and united with the
                  fresh bloom of childhood, made her singularly lovely. Curls of fine, golden silk
                  crowned the sweet head; the little rosebud mouth was drawn into a happy
                  half-smile, and her largo violet eyes were full of hope and love and a tendency to
                  look upward and to linger upon the object.</p>
               <p>"Shall I carry you, little Peace?" asked the boy.</p>
               <p>"No, Lolo, I can walk fast enough, if you hold my hand."</p>
               <pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC7182-00000052"/>
               <p>He had stooped and lifted her tenderly over a log that lay in their path, and they
                  walked on. Meantime the elder boy had jumped from the bank and stood now upon the
                  shore of the brook, looking into the swift waters. In a moment after, the girl
                  jumped down beside him. He turned to her and said—</p>
               <p>"You here, Fida, why you have left little Peace?"</p>
               <p>"Oh," she said. "you ran first, and I ran after you. Peace is behind with Lolo,
                  and will be here in a moment. See; see that beautiful red bird on the brier
                  yonder!"</p>
               <p>In a moment the boy stooped, caught up a stone, and flung it with deadly aim. The
                  poor bird was dashed from its perch, and fell dead into the brook.</p>
               <p>"Oh, brother!" and the tears rose in the girl's clear eyes.</p>
               <p>The boy blushed.</p>
               <p>"It <emph>was</emph> a mean thing to do," he said impetuously. "I wish I could
                  think before I do things I did not mean to kill him, Fida, and I'm very sorry.
                  Don't tell little Peace."</p>
               <p>As he spoke, the child appeared on the bank above him. He hastened to lift her
                  down to the shore, when she began to pluck the wild flowers, and when she had
                  filled her lap, she sate quietly down to weave them into a crown. The others threw
                  themselves upon the grass beside her, and Ardens, for so was the elder lad called,
                  said—</p>
               <p>"Well, now for our council. What are we to do for a home? Our house will hold us
                  no longer. It gets worse and worse every day. We cannot even rest in it any
                  longer, and what are we to do?"</p>
               <p>"Cannot we find shelter with our neighbors?" asked Lolo.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied his brother if we separate, but not otherwise. If we break up and
                  part and never see each other any more?"</p>
               <p>"Ah me," said the younger lad, "that will never, never do. I cannot get along
                  without you. I should die."</p>
               <p>"And I," cried Ardens, "if we have to separate, will go and be a soldier and get
                  killed in battle."</p>
               <p>"It is not right to part," said Fida, "and I never will consent. Besides, who is
                  to take care of little Peace?"</p>
               <p>They all turned their eyes to the child. Her little hands lay idle among the
                  flowers in her lap, her lip was trembling, and the big tears were falling from her
                  violet eyes.</p>
               <p>"Don't cry, Peace," said Ardens, catching her up in his arms, "we will never
                  separate, but all live and die together. Trust to me, I shall find a way."</p>
               <pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC7182-00000053"/>
               <p>"If we were to ask somebody older than ourselves?" suggested Lolo.</p>
               <p>"The Solitary knows," said Fida.</p>
               <p>"Certainly!" cried Ardens, "why did I not think of that before? Come, let us go to
                  him at once." So saying he sprang up, and taking little Peace in his arms, set off
                  at a rapid pace through the glades along the brook.</p>
               <p>An hour's walk brought them to a range of low rocks, which beginning at the
                  rivulet ran back to the mountain chain. Just here the glades or cleared woods
                  ended, and the thick dark, primeval forest began. Here dwelt, in a natural cave of
                  small size, an aged man, who led a solitary life of prayer and contemplation. Fida
                  and Ardens had both visited him, and from his kindness then, approached him now
                  with confidence. They found him sitting at the door of his cell, with an antique
                  volume upon his knees. He blessed them as they came up, and taking the child upon
                  his knee, waited for them to tell their errand.</p>
               <p>Ardens began and told clearly and well their situation; how they were threatened
                  with separation, how it was impossible to live in their house any longer, and how
                  they were determined to seek some other shelter."</p>
               <p>"Besides," added Fida, "our mother, while she lived, used to tell us that we had a
                  house away in some distant land, and if we could but reach it, that we should be
                  happy forever there. But she died and, left us alone, and if somebody do not guide
                  us, how shall we ever find it?"</p>
               <p>"And so, we came to you, Father," said Ardens, "to be taught."</p>
               <p>"You have done well, children," the old man said gently, "I have long known that
                  you could live no longer where you were; and I have seen many dangers growing
                  around you which you never suspected. You do well to fly. And your mother's
                  words-were true words. You have another shelter. It is the House of Gold which
                  stands on the Mountain of God. In this House dwelt the eternal Dove, and from its
                  portals came the great High King. And it was He who prepared this Golden House for
                  you and for all who are good because he loved you. He had many enemies who were
                  yours also, and who are and will be so until you reach your home. They tried to
                  prevent Him from preparing any good for you, but so strong was His love, that He
                  gave up His crown and Throne and even His life for your sake. And He it is who has
                  made the Golden House so pure and beautiful and perfect, and Who wishes that you
                  may find it and be sheltered there forever."</p>
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC7182-00000054"/>
               <p>"I love that King!" said little Peace in a low voice.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my child' said the Solitary, "and you will love Him ever more and more, but
                  never so well as he has loved you."</p>
               <p>"And will you show me the way?" asked Ardens.</p>
               <p>"No, my son, I cannot go with you."</p>
               <p>"Ah me!" sighed Lolo, "I shall never get there."</p>
               <p>"Do not be down-hearted," said the old man. "You must be cheerful and brave."
                  (Ardens drew himself up.) "But not too bold, nor too self-confident." (Ardens
                  subsided and colored a little.) "I cannot go with you. But your way at first lies
                  through the forest and along the brook. You will find in a place like to this,
                  only on the other side of the forest and at the foot of the mountain, a shepherd
                  who keeps his flock there, and he will prepare you for the rest of your journey.
                  But you must be careful, for the forest is dark, and has many windings; and there
                  are marshy places, and sometimes you may lose sight of the brook, But, be brave,
                  keep all together, cherish the little child, and you will succeed. But you must
                  have a leader."</p>
               <p>"Yes, follow me," cried Ardens, "and let us start at once for the glorious House
                  of Gold"</p>
               <p>"Softly!" said the hermit, "I am not sure but that yonder quiet lad would be the
                  safest leader through the forest."</p>
               <p>"I," said poor Lolo, "O, no! I never could lead any one. I always follow Ardens
                  and Fida."</p>
               <p>"Come here all, and let me look into your eyes," said the Solitary. And when they
                  stood before him he looked seriously at them, and said, "They are all good, pure
                  innocent eyes, but these," laying his hand on Fida's head, "are the clearest and
                  most steadfast. She shall lead you through the forest."</p>
               <p>Ardens muttered something indistinctly about "having to follow a girl!" but he
                  cleared up, and resigned himself, as little Peace called Fida and crowned her with
                  the flowers she had wreathed.</p>
               <p>"Well now, Fida," said Ardens, "you are Queen, why do we not start?"</p>
               <p>"Have you any provision for the journey?" asked the old man. "You will need some;
                  and I have not enough in my poor cell here to offer you."</p>
               <p>"We have plenty at home," said Fida.</p>
               <p>"And I will go back and fetch it," said Lolo.</p>
               <p>"Good old Lolo!" said little Peace.</p>
               <p>"And while you are gone," said the Solitary, "I will teach the others a prayer
                  which you must utter night and morning on bended knees until your<pb n="96-97"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000055"/> journey shall be ended. They will teach it to you
                  on the way."</p>
               <p>"very well," answered Lolo cheerfully, "I am not very bright, but I can learn if
                  Fida will teach me." Fida nodded, and the boy started off.</p>
               <p>While he was gone, the Solitary taught them this little prayer: <q>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>Father! lend a gracious ear!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Dark the forest shadows blend,</l>
                        <l>Steep the crags their crests uprear,</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Wide the desert sands extend.</l>
                        <l>Guard his to our destined seat,</l>
                        <l>Nerve and guide our pilgrim feet.</l>
                     </lg>
                     <lg type="stanza">
                        <l>'Neath Thy wings our lives unfold!</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Be our souls Thy sacred care,</l>
                        <l>Till the stately House of Gold</l>
                        <l rend="ti-1">Ope and bid us welcome there.</l>
                        <l>Guard us to our destined seat,</l>
                        <l>Nerve and guide our pilgrim feet.</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Ardens learned this immediately, but was apt to put one word for another. Fida was
                  slower but more accurate, and little Peace had a way of crooning it over in a low
                  song to herself which was quite as successful as any; and so by the time they knew
                  it well, Lolo came up with a bundle on his shoulder and a small woodman's axe in
                  his belt. Then they all kneeled down and the old man blessed them, and following
                  the course of the brook, they struck at once into the deep forest and he saw them
                  no more.</p>
               <p>On went the children bravely along the murmuring brook, but when the sun began to
                  decline in the West, even Ardens found himself walking slowly, with the bundle
                  slung upon a stick between himself and Fida, and Lolo was trudging gallantly
                  behind them with little Peace asleep in his arms.</p>
               <p>They came to an open grassy place at the foot of an overhanging rock, and here
                  they determined to rest for the night. Lolo's hatchet soon cut down a quantity of
                  branches,, and with these he and Ardens built a hut against the rock for their
                  sisters. They were hardy fellows, and the night promised to be fine, so that they
                  determined to have no shelter but the sky.</p>
               <p>They made a frugal repast, and then after chatting awhile over their past and
                  their hope for the future, they knelt and repeated their prayer. And soon the
                  beautiful stars arose in the deep blue heavens and poured their soft light through
                  the leaves upon the still forms of the slumbering children.</p>
               <p>They awoke with the sun and were soon ready for a start. They had now to reckon
                  upon a whole march and upon penetrating deep into the<pb n="98-99"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000056"/> lonely forest. All went well for awhile, but the
                  pace at which Ardens walked soon proved too swift for the child, and although she
                  made no complaint, she began to look pale and fatigued.</p>
               <p>"Don't go so fast, brother," said Fida. "Peace cannot keep up."</p>
               <p>"Fast!" he cried, "why we will never get through if you call this fast. Come here
                  little one!"</p>
               <p>He stooped, and very willingly the child stretched out her arms, and was taken up
                  by him. But his burden soon grew heavy: he began to regret the unnecessary outlay
                  of strength he had made at the beginning of the march, leaping over fallen trees,
                  and climbing up the occasional rocks. First he became silent, then his pace began
                  to lag, and at last, although he held out heroically, his arms began to ache, and
                  he was obliged to propose a halt.</p>
               <p>And when they had rested and were ready to go on again, he made up objection to
                  his brother's proposition to take the child while he and Fida should share the
                  bundle between them.</p>
               <p>So on they went, ever deeper and deeper into the old wood, and every hour their
                  difficulties increased. Sometimes a spur of rocks, or a plashy marsh would force
                  them from the brook, and they would have hard work to find it again. Sometimes a
                  number of deer paths would puzzle them and a dispute would arise, or they would
                  take the wrong one, and after a long error be obliged to plod wearily back.</p>
               <p>Once Ardens was sure that the true road led over a particular rock, and insisted
                  on crossing it. When the others demurred to the fatigue of climbing it perhaps for
                  nothing he reproached them.</p>
               <p>"We will never get to the Golden House," he said, "if we go along in this jog-trot
                  way. You must have some fire in you. Come along, follow me!"</p>
               <p>Then he sprang upon the rocks which formed merely a narrow line, and, almost
                  without looking, jumped down, on the other side, up to his waist in a filthy black
                  mire; and then he saw, stretching before him, a foul, interminable bog, where long
                  ugly vines were twisting about, and grey water snakes were basking, coiled upon
                  the tufts of coarse grass.</p>
               <p>He came out very much cooled in body and calmed in mind. He looked rather foolish,
                  but as nobody laughed at him, and his brother soon scraped the mud off him, he
                  ceased to think about it.</p>
               <p>Then again they would find themselves nearly surrounded by a dense thicket with no
                  way appearing out of it on any side, and just as they would<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000057"/> nearly lose courage and prepare to go back, Fida's
                  keen eye would espy the right path.</p>
               <p>So on they went for three days and nights, and now a new danger threatened them.
                  Their provisions were almost gone, and they knew not how far the gloomy forest
                  still extended They had become accustomed to its sights and sounds now also, and
                  these had no longer any novelty to cheer or excite them. But still Fida and Ardens
                  led the way stoutly and Lolo followed with little Peace. And still at morning and
                  evening their voices were strong, clear and full of hope as they said or sang
                  their prayer.</p>
               <p>When at noon on the fourth day they sate down beneath a huge wide-spreading tree,
                  and laid out their stock of food, it was seen that there was not enough for
                  two.</p>
               <p>"Pooh!" said Ardens as he saw this, although he had a right to be and was very
                  hungry! "I don't want any of that! I shall wait until I can catch a rabbit and
                  roast him for myself."</p>
               <p>So he strolled off among the bushes to see if he could find any wild fruits. Fida
                  ate two or three mouthfuls and saw that little Peace made a full hearty meal.</p>
               <p>"Now, Lolo," she said, "you eat the rest and let us hope for a better supper
                  to-night."</p>
               <p>But Lolo, quietly slipped what was left into his pocket, and dined on a drink of
                  water.</p>
               <p>They rose from their noon repose with a sigh and marched on. But they were very
                  still, and moved with their eyes on the ground. It seemed to grow dusk earlier
                  than usual, and one of them remarked the height of the undergrowth. They then
                  looked up and saw that both sides of the narrow road were lined with trees and
                  with tall, tangled undergrowth, so tall and thick and dense as to look black in
                  the feeble light.</p>
               <p>The child complained of hunger, and Lolo gave her the remnants of their last meal.
                  They listened for the murmur of the brook, but they had wandered they knew not how
                  far away from it. And they were alone now in that dismal wood, without food or
                  drink, tired and hungry, and the night was falling fast.</p>
               <p>Then they went on, but the wood grew denser and blacker, and the open way narrowed
                  and tapered, and at last ended abruptly in a hopeless thicket. They could now
                  scarcely see each other's faces, and as they stood there mute and almost in
                  despair, the shadows of the pitiless night fell heavier and heavier upon them, and
                  they were in total darkness.</p>
               <p>Then Fida spoke in a trembling voice "Let us<pb n="102-103"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000058"/> say our prayer now!" and kneeling down close
                  together, the poor children poured, from the very depth of their hearts, their
                  supplication: <q>
                     <lg type="quotatoin">
                        <l>"Father lend a gracious ear.</l>
                        <l>Dark the forest shadows blend."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And as they finished, and still remained upon their knees, they heard far, far
                  off, but terribly clear and recognizable, the howl of a wolf!</p>
               <p>Ardens sprang to his feet.</p>
               <p>"I will break through that wood somewhere," he said, "and try to find an outlet.
                  Sit still here, and I will try to find an outlet. Sit still here, and if I find
                  any path I will call, and you can follow my voice."</p>
               <p>"Do not go!" they all cried, and Fida added, "Stay with us Ardens, if we are to
                  die let it be together."</p>
               <p>"No," said he, "I will go. There is a chance for me, and that is better than to
                  sit still here in the dark and be——."</p>
               <p>He was silent, but the long howl was heard again and completed his sentence. They
                  shivered coldly as they heard it.</p>
               <p>"I go," he said, "Pray to our Father for me."</p>
               <p>His step was heard upon the sward, then the crackling of the undergrowth as ho
                  burst his way through: and then a despairing shriek pierced the gloom; a crash as
                  of rapidly breaking branches, a rush as stones and earth falling to a great depth.
                  Then all was still, and the three clutched each other and grew rigid with
                  horror.</p>
               <p>But matters were not so bad as they feared; in moment they heard their brother's
                  voice calling their names.</p>
               <p>"Here, here, Ardens I but where are you?"</p>
               <p>"Listen!" he answered, "but do not move an inch. I have fallen from the edge of a
                  precipice, but into a strong tree, and I am not hurt."</p>
               <p>"What can we do?"</p>
               <p>"I do not know. You, Lolo, creep towards my voice; but down on all fours, mind!
                  and; stretch your hands well out at every step until you feel the edge of the
                  rock; then we may find out some way of relief."</p>
               <p>"I come, Ardens cried Lolo cheerfully," hold on and don't be afraid."</p>
               <p>Little Peace began to cry. But Fida, although she felt like weeping herself,
                  forced herself to say,</p>
               <p>"Do not cry, little sister, Lolo must go to help Ardens. He is only going a little
                  way and both will soon be back." Then she drew the poor trembling child upon her
                  lap and clasped her closely to her bosom.</p>
               <pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC7182-00000059"/>
               <p>"Now, brother go, and be careful!"</p>
               <p>Then the boy got down upon all fours, and alternately calling to Ardens and
                  waiting for his reply., he crept warily on his way. Putting his hands out before
                  him one after another as far as he could reach he advanced slowly. It was but a
                  few yards before he felt the edge of the rock, and knew by the Ml of the loose
                  earth which his touch displaced that he was upon the brink.</p>
               <p>"That earth fell near me, Lolo," said Ardens, "crawl toward the right."</p>
               <p>The boy moved carefully along until his hand fell upon a strong, gnarled tree
                  root, and then another, and then a mass of roots with earth embedded between them.
                  He could feel others running back into the soil behind him, and at once
                  comprehended the position.</p>
               <p>"All right, brother," he said cheerfully, "I know all about if now. A tree has
                  been blown over and is hanging top downwards. You are in the branches and I have
                  the roots here. Try if you cannot feel the trunk above you."</p>
               <p>"I have it; I have it!" was the answer. a It is a cedar; the pitch is sticking to
                  my hands; and now that I have got over my alarm, I can smell the-foliage. I wish I
                  could see!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, indeed, yes; but don't you think you could climb towards me safely? I am out
                  on [ho edge of the mass of roots; they are as thick as my arm and as strong as
                  iron. I am just above you; hold down your head and I will drop a twig. There! did
                  that strike you!"</p>
               <p>"Right on the neck; you are exactly above me. Here I come."</p>
               <p>Lolo heard his brother's movements along the trunk of the cedar, and when Ardens
                  spoke again he was close beneath him.</p>
               <p>"Can you let go one hand?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, yes! I am safe astride the trunk. Put your hand down and I will try to touch
                  it." After a moment's groping about, their hands met, and strong was the grasp
                  with which they caught each other. Then slowly and strongly Lolo, drew up his
                  brother's hand and guided it to a root.</p>
               <p>"Have you got a good hold? and can you give me the other hand?</p>
               <p>"Yes! here," and Lolo seized it with both of his; and said,</p>
               <p>"Now, brother, slowly! surely! up you come!"</p>
               <p>In another moment muscular Ardens had swung himself up with Lolo's help, and then
                  the brothers fell back upon the grass and Jay there exhausted clasped in each
                  other's arms.</p>
               <p>The silence alarmed Fida and she called.</p>
               <pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC7182-00000060"/>
               <p>"We are coming!" answered Ardens. "Both are safe. Come, brother, side by side. Oh,
                  Lolo, how often you have helped me when my hot head got me into trouble, and now
                  you have saved my life. You are the dearest and best old fellow in the whole
                  universe!"</p>
               <p>Poor Lolo felt himself blushing in the dark; he was not accustomed to receive
                  praise, and as he did not know exactly what to do with it, he forgot it But he
                  felt very happy. And so they crept back to their sisters who seized upon both as
                  if determined that they should not move again.</p>
               <p>But they had no desire to do so. For they were weak now with fasting and the
                  reaction of their late excitement After sitting in silence for awhile, Ardens
                  threw himself back upon the sward, with a sigh of faintness; but starting up
                  again, he cried,</p>
               <p>Look up! look up!"</p>
               <p>They all looked up and saw the blessed light. Although they were surrounded with
                  pitchy darkness, and although even overhead the unlopped boughs of the immemorial
                  forest, clothed thickly with their midsummer, foliage, formed a nearly
                  impenetrable roof, yet they could see the pale faint lustre through them,</p>
               <p>"Oh!" said little Peace, "if we only had wings!"</p>
               <p>A breeze arose and rustled through the leaves and died away again.</p>
               <p>"Now all be still," said Fida, "lot me try to hear the brook, She crouched down,
                  put her ear close to the ground and listened intently. No sound but the chirp of
                  the insects was audible. As she raised her head disappointed, a single spark in
                  the thicket in front of her attracted her attention. Her falcon eye dilated and
                  fixed upon it. She thought at first it was a glow worm; but no, it was not green
                  enough for that. Without losing sight of it, or even rising, she spoke,</p>
               <p>"I see a spark in the thicket there; do not move nor speak while I creep towards
                  it," and then, her eyes aching with the intensity of their gaze, she moved towards
                  it. It was a drop, a little trembling drop of pale blue light. Slowly she advanced
                  her hand, and the light glowed upon it as she grasped the polished stem of a shrub
                  upon which it had rested.</p>
               <p>"Lolo! bring your axe and creep toward me!"</p>
               <p>He came and she guided his hand to the bush.</p>
               <p>"Cut the stem and pull the whole bush out!"</p>
               <p>The boy obeyed, but not easily, for the shrub was tali and full branched and
                  densely leaved; but he dragged it free at last and threw it behind him, and then a
                  hundred sparkling drops like water thrown<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC7182-00000061"
                  /> from a cup, sparkled upon the thick stems. Swift fell the hatchet, and bush
                  after bush was torn away. The light poured in. Little Peace saw it, and clapped
                  her hands for joy. They were soon all at work. Lolo cutting and the others
                  dragging away. They received some scratches and some blows from the switching
                  branches, but they laughed at these. And the passage widened, and the glad soft
                  beautiful light poured in more and more, and they pierced the thicket, and came
                  out upon a clear and nearly open plain.</p>
               <p>On the left near them they could distinguish the dark line of the gorge in which
                  Ardens had so nearly been lost; beyond that, the tall forest which had thrown a
                  double shadow of darkness over the place which they had left; and above that,
                  rolling upwards in silver splendor, the full orbed moon.</p>
               <p>To the right, a sinuous broad line of rippling golden radiance lay upon the plain,
                  and they cried out for joy, "The brook! the brook!"</p>
               <p>Their cry was answered by the bark of a dog; and that was followed by the
                  plaintive bleating of sheep. Then they heard a human voice, and at last saw a low
                  cottage with a large fold beside it.</p>
               <p>"It is the house of the shepherd!" they exclaimed, and in a moment all fatigue was
                  forgotten. Then the huge wiry-haired dog came bounding towards them, and Ardens
                  caught the hatchet from Lolo and strode in front; but little Peace ran past him,
                  and the dog thrust his rough cold nose into her little hand, and walked placidly
                  beside her as if they had been friends for years.</p>
               <p>The Shepherd came to meet them. A venerable, mild old man, with silvery hair and
                  beard.</p>
               <p>"Who are you, my children, who wander so late?"</p>
               <p>"We are young pilgrims, sir, who seek the House of Gold, and we bring you a
                  greeting from the Solitary who lives on the other side of that dreadful
                  forest."</p>
               <p>"How long have you been in the wood?"</p>
               <p>"Four long days and three nights, and this, the longest, dreariest of all."</p>
               <p>"Poor children, you must be footsore and heart-sore both. Come to my home."</p>
               <p>He took the child up in his arms and led the way, the dog gambolling round and
                  round them.</p>
               <p>And first, in the sweet cool waters, drawn from a well near the cottage, he washed
                  their hands and faces and feet, and blessed them, signing a cross upon their
                  foreheads. Then he brought them into the house and set food before them, and when
                  they had eaten he bade them sing their prayer, and then<pb n="110-111"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000062"/> showed them neat little cells, where pleasant beds
                  lay white and ready for them.</p>
               <p>"Now go, dear children, and forget your troubles in repose."</p>
               <p>Little Peace put her arms round his neck, and kissed his withered cheek, as he
                  pressed her gently to his heart. The others kissed his hand and then retired, and
                  in sweet, calm slumber the dark and weary forest was forgotten.</p>
               <p>Three days they rested with the Shepherd, and on the night of the third he bade
                  them be ready to start early in the morning. Round the neck of each he hung a
                  silver medal, which each must keep clean and bright by his own care; and which
                  only evil doing or evil thought or word could tarnish. That was to be their main
                  vigilance in the journey, to keep these spotless. Then he gave them a mirror,
                  which he told them was the Mirror of Justice. It was to be carried where it could
                  be easily seen. "And if," said he, "it shows a distorted feature, a dark brow, or
                  curled lip; if indeed it show your faces in other guise than calm and pleasant and
                  simple, stop then, and search your hearts for evil.</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, O beloved little ones, you are to commence the passage of that
                  mountain which you see so tall and vast there rising from the plain; for the House
                  which you seek is beyond it. There you will find new hardships and difficulties,
                  such as you have not in the country whence you come. Many means of temporary
                  relief which others use, are forbidden to them who wear those medals or carry that
                  mirror. Many a path will seem the wrong one, and many an ascent too rough to be
                  overcome, and many a spot impassable. But yet that is the way. Be brave but not
                  over bold, faithful but not self-confident, humble but not timid. If you come to
                  several roads, hold up the mirror; it will reflect only the right one; but if the
                  face be distorted that looks in it, it will show nothing. And above all remember
                  that if you suffer your medals to become tarnished and to lose their lustre you
                  will never sec nor reach the Golden House."</p>
               <p>And on the morrow they awoke. Ardens renewed in strength like a young giant, and
                  blooming with health and high spirits. Fida and Lolo declared that they never were
                  so well, and little Peace, if not so gay as the rest, wore a happy, contented
                  look. She was, it is true,, rather thin for so young a child, but that gloomy
                  forest had been a hard trial.</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC7182-00000063"/>
               <p>The Shepherd filled the knapsack with provision, and accompanied them to the foot
                  of the hill. There he bade them "Farewell, and remember." and returned to his
                  flock.</p>
               <p>At first the way was pleasant enough, the ascent was gentle, the turf soft and
                  enamelled with flowers, and they proceeded right happily onward and upward. But in
                  half-an-hour or so little Peace grew silent, and paced along in a very grave way,
                  looking downwards; and then the flowers she had gathered seemed to grow heavy, and
                  if she dropped one she did not pick it up again; and then she ran up and caught
                  hold of Fida's hand, and that did for awhile But at the end of an hour she grew
                  pale, and began to cast longing glances from her large eyes at Ardens, who was
                  bounding along like a stag in his glad sensation of strength, and that pecular
                  feeling of freedom which a mountain gives. At last her younger brother caught one
                  of these looks, and called out—</p>
               <p>"Ardens, come take the knapsack, Peace is tired."</p>
               <p>But the elder boy caught up the child gently, tossed her to a seat upon his
                  shoulder, and away up the mountain side like a chamois. Higher and higher, and the
                  ascent grew more steep. The turf grew thinner and drier as the soil thinned; the
                  flowers were scarcer; only the large pale violet, or the azure mountain gentian
                  bloomed here, and above them shone clusters of the crimson and gold-hearted rock
                  rose.</p>
               <p>A boulder had fallen directly across the path; but nothing could check the course
                  of fiery Ardens.</p>
               <p>"Hold fast round my neck, little pet!" he said; and so, with the child still on
                  his shoulder, he scaled the rough sides of the rock, and stood triumphant on the
                  top. "Now, Fida, give me your hand; put your feet in the broken places, so! up,
                  you come! Hand up the sack Lolo. Now reach up! I've got it. Here we are all!" Then
                  he sprang down and bade Peace jump into his arms, which she did fearlessly; he
                  helped down Fida, would have taken the little one up again, but she declared
                  herself rested, and so he made his brother throw down the sack to him, and tossing
                  that upon his shoulders he led the way.</p>
               <p>But the road was steep and rough, occasional patches of thin snow lay here and
                  there, and there were long stretches of bare granite, slippery with long attrition
                  of snows, and bearing no vegetation but ugly flat grey lichens. Then there were
                  hollows filled with mud, or masses of fallen rock to climb painfully over.</p>
               <p>The elder girl often stopped, half discouraged at<pb n="114-115"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000064"/> some of these passages, but Ardens would help her
                  over, with a jest or cheerful remark. Lolo had a way of getting down upon hands
                  and knees for these perilous passes, that seemed to give him great comfort, and
                  which enlivened the others at his expense. But he laughed with them.</p>
               <p>"I know," he said, "that it is not the handsomest way, but I think it is the
                  surest."</p>
               <p>Ardens was the life and courage of all; he was so full of happy energy, so lithe
                  and handsome, as he carried or lifted the child in all the bad places, or helped
                  Fida with his hand. The mountain air and exercise filled his dark eyes with light,
                  tossed his fine chestnut hair, and gave his cheek the color of the rock rose.</p>
               <p>"We should never get up without you!" said the others.</p>
               <p>"Pooh!" he cried, "you all do well enough, and see up yonder! Do you see that hut
                  at the foot of the peak there. There we shall have dinner, and little Peace shall
                  get a good long sleep."</p>
               <p>The child smiled sweetly on him, and stretched out her arms. He flung the knapsack
                  to his brother, and took her on his shoulder. But it was a hard climb, the ascent
                  was steep and the path was full of shingle on which they slipped, and bits of it
                  would turn and hurt their feet. Even Ardens panted when they reached the resting
                  place, half-cell half-hut, and they all sate, or lay down for some moments, repose
                  before they spread out their provisions and ate their frugal meal.</p>
               <p>There were fagots there, and Ardens made a fire In the rough rock chimney, for the
                  air of those elevated regions was cold. So when they had dined and little Peace
                  had been composed to sleep in a warm corner upon a fragrant couch of cedar
                  foliage, Ardens said,</p>
               <p>"Now get all the rest you can, for we have a hard afternoon's work before us!"</p>
               <p>Hard indeed it was, for the first steps almost seem impossible. Before them, as
                  they stood in a group, rose a peak almost a hundred feet in height, and sheer and
                  steep as the wall of a tower. To the left stretched the multitudinous
                  glacier-waves, the broken iron crags and snowy summits of the pathless mountain;
                  on the right yawned a vast unfathomable gorge, so deep that the roar of the fierce
                  torrent that swept furiously through it, sounded to them but as the murmur of a
                  woodland brook. Road they saw none.</p>
               <p>"What we are to do here, I do not know," said Lolo. "Even Ardens could not get
                  over that unless he had the wings that little Peace wished for in the forest."</p>
               <pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC7182-00000065"/>
               <p>"There must be a way! said Fida.</p>
               <p>"Let us look in the Mirror," cried Ardens. They turned the glass towards the peak,
                  and there distinguished a darker line running apparently round its base. They
                  walked towards it then, and saw a frightful path along the very brink of the
                  gorge. It was not long; fifteen or twenty steps would measure it; but it was
                  scarcely two feet wide. On one side rose the inaccessible wall of rock, on the
                  other yawned the terrible gulf. A blast of wind, a false step, a sudden start, and
                  the traveller must be dashed to atoms far, far below.</p>
               <p>"Surely," said Ardens, "shuddering as he looked at it, "people do not pass
                  that."</p>
               <p>"It must be the way," said Fida, "for the Mirror shows it. Let me try it, I am not
                  afraid."</p>
               <p>"No," answered Ardens, "I will go first; if it is safe, you can follow." His cheek
                  lost its color and his heart stopped beating, but the brave boy nerved himself,
                  resolutely stepped forward, and walked swiftly over. He stood for a moment to
                  recover himself, and then said,</p>
               <p>"Now, I will come back for little Peace."</p>
               <p>"No, I can go alone," said the child, "I shall not fall!" and before she could be
                  stopped she had run forward, and was on the edge of the abyss.</p>
               <p>Then Fida saw floating in the air, by the child's side, the white-winged,
                  white-robed figure of an Angel. His earnest, loving eyes were fixed upon the
                  child, and his hands held out as if to guide her and support her. And when Ardens
                  caught her hand, the Angel, seen only by Fida, soared away upward into the serene
                  blue deeps of Heaven.</p>
               <p>Then Fida crossed without a tremor.</p>
               <p>But it was not so with Lolo. He was a stout fellow and no coward, but that passage
                  was too much for his nerves; and he stood there looking at it helplessly, while
                  the others called to him to come.</p>
               <p>"Take courage, and walk boldly!" cried Ardens.</p>
               <p>"Don't think about it, but come!" said Fida.</p>
               <p>"Crawl over, Lolo!" said the sweet voice of little Peace.</p>
               <p>"So I will!" said Lolo; and down he went on hands and knees, and with fear and
                  trembling crept safely across."</p>
               <p>"Oh, laugh away, if you like," he said smiling as he rose to his feet. "But I
                  learned that way of travelling in the forest there, and it is a very good way for
                  me. I intend to adopt it altogether if we have much more of this sort of
                  country."</p>
               <p>Thenceforward the march was very difficult, the sun had softened the thin snow,
                  and their feet were soon wet and chill; they slipped often, and occa-<pb
                     n="118-119" xml:id="VAC7182-00000066"/> sional falls splashed them with
                  half-melted snow and mud. The heat of the sun with their severe labor, enfeebled
                  and exhausted them. If they stood still to breathe, the cool breeze pierced them
                  through, and ever the steep mountain side rose before them, and all around were
                  broken crags, white peaks and fearful yawning chasms.</p>
               <p>Fida grew faint and weary. Lolo drew his wearied limbs painfully along. Ardens was
                  a hero. He carried little Peace nearly all the way; he gave his arm to his elder
                  sister, and he cheered his brother with his voice. And so at last, the steep was
                  passed before sunset, and a low stone building sheltered by a height of some fifty
                  feet at the foot of which it stood, received the young pilgrims.</p>
               <p>The others were thoroughly fatigued, and sank upon the rude benches which
                  charitable hands had provided in the building. It was Ardens who made the fire;
                  Ardens who caused them dry their shoes and clothing, who spread out their meal,
                  and who hunted up the store of mountain hay and made warm couches for them
                  all.</p>
               <p>"We should have died on the mountain side but for you'" said Fida gratefully.</p>
               <p>"I never saw such a fellow for hard work!" said Lolo, nodding sleepily.</p>
               <p>Peace patted his cheek as she sate drowsily upon his knee. Then he roused them for
                  their evening prayer, and that over, sent them off to sleep. Then with a happy
                  heart he lay down and forgot all his cares and weariness in slumber.</p>
               <p>He rose in the grey of the morning and made a brisk fire before he roused the
                  others. Their toilette was short, for they remembered what work was before them.
                  All complained of soreness and stiffness, but Ardens told them that would soon go
                  off with walking. So they went out into the dim light and began their journey. But
                  at the foot of the hill they paused.</p>
               <p>"Oh dear," said Fida, "must we climb all day to-day too?"</p>
               <p>"I think not," said Ardens, "here goes for one hill at any rate." He started off,
                  his feet crackling on the snow which the cool night had made dry and crisp, and
                  ran to the summit of the hill. As he reached it, he shouted aloud.</p>
               <p>"The climbing is over! This is the very summit," and, he added, with his eyes upon
                  the mirror, "the road winds down, down hill gently to the base."</p>
               <p>It was a noble face also that the Mirror of Justice reflected there, unstained by
                  an unworthy idea or feeling, lighted up by thought for others, and dignified with
                  the look of that true courtesy the soul whereof is self-sacrifice.</p>
               <pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC7182-00000067"/>
               <p>And as he stood there on the summit, looking to the children below much larger
                  than he was, the mist began to break up and curl away in wreaths around him, and
                  the slant beams of the rising sun turned them to filmy gold. Beauty sate on his
                  brow and cheek and looked from his fine dark eye. Strength stood erect upon the
                  peak there in his lithe and elegant form, and the gauzy glory floated round him;
                  and his soul at that moment was more beautiful than his form.</p>
               <p>And bright as a diamond in the early rays flashed the burnished silver medal upon
                  his breast; and the children looked up at him there and murmured to each other how
                  handsome and how good Ardens was.</p>
               <p>Then he came down again and carried Peace up, followed by the rest. And they stood
                  there on the mountain top, and were refreshed by the sight of the glorious
                  panorama of height and plain. Two great obstacles on their way to the Golden House
                  had been overcome, but the end of their journey was not yet.</p>
               <p>The summit on which they stood was covered with snow; and Ardens proposed to show
                  how mountaineers got down such passes, by sliding. So he sate down and started,
                  but the motion grew swifter than he had expected, he lost his equilibrium, rolled
                  over three or four times and came with something of a thump, although unhurt, to
                  the bottom. It was very funny to see him tumbling over, and the children laughed;
                  but at the sound of their mirth he sprang up, and walked angrily away.</p>
               <p>"They would have laughed," he muttered to himself, "if I had broken my neck. And
                  they would not have been where they could see my fall if it had not been for me. I
                  hate ungrateful people. It is well for them that they are younger than I, or I
                  would leave them to take care of themselves. That would soon stop their
                  laughing."</p>
               <p>He turned back not in kindness but in pride to take the hand of the child; and the
                  diamond lustre had altogether faded from the medal, and a grey spot upon its
                  surface looked as if eaten there by acids.</p>
               <p>Lolo had not noticed his brother's anger, and Fida though she saw it, thought it
                  would pass away soon. But, unfortunately, this course only made him worse. "They
                  don't care," he thought, "whether I am angry or not. They think that they can do
                  well enough without me now that there are no more mountains to climb. Yesterday I
                  was good Ardens; brave Ardens! and now! I hate selfishness!"</p>
               <p>Having thus got upon a wrong track, he pursued<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000068"/> it with the energy and warmth of his nature and
                  soon wrought himself up to a most unhappy pitch of pride. He began to run hither
                  and thither off the road, sometimes to gather rock roses as they swung from the
                  brink of a precipice, sometimes to spring down the sides of a gorge to the terror
                  of the children and his own peril.</p>
               <p>"Do not go off the path, Ardens," said Fida, "it is so dangerous."</p>
               <p>"Oh," he answered, "just watch yourself, please; you thought I could get
                     <emph>up</emph> well enough; trust me for getting safely down the
                  mountain."</p>
               <p>"But it is wrong," urged the girl gently, "the Shepherd forbade us to leave the
                  road; and besides you might lose the mirror, and then we could no longer find our
                  way."</p>
               <p>"Lose the Mirror!" he answered perversely, "yes, that I suspect, you care for a
                  good deal more than for the breaking of my neck."</p>
               <p>Fida kept silent, and they went on. It was very hard work. The steepness of the
                  descent forced their feet forward into their shoes and made them very painful,
                  pressing the nails into the flesh. Sometimes a rough, irregular, natural staircase
                  jolted them, and sometimes a smooth slope of bare rock made them slip and the
                  muscular exertion to keep erect racked their limbs.</p>
               <p>This and the recklessness of their elder brother, with the consequent lack of
                  cheerfulness, made their march a heavy one, and they were completely worn out when
                  they stopped at noonday. Their strength had given out before they reached the
                  usual midway station, and they had seated themselves at the foot of a rock on the
                  roadside. In front on the other side of the road was a rift eight or ten feet
                  deep, of a sort common enough in mountains. The old leaves, the detritus of rock,
                  and the dust brought upon the winds drift into these and form a soil, and this the
                  warm. trickling of springs and the running of melted snow in summer turn into
                  sluggish black mud. A few rough reed-like plants find sustenance in this.</p>
               <p>Ardens had suffered his sister and brother to make themselves as comfortable as
                  they could, without offering even to assist them, but now when they began to eat,
                  he approached them and said—</p>
               <p>"Am I to have nothing to eat?"</p>
               <p>"Oh brother," said Fida, reproachfully, "you know that all that we have is yours,
                  it is before you."</p>
               <p>He replied by a sneer. Little Peace looked at him with astonishment, and a feeling
                  of fear of that strong, brave but unkind brother crept coldly over her heart. He
                  took what he wanted and walked away to eat it.</p>
               <pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC7182-00000069"/>
               <p>Then Peace slept with her head in her sister's lap, and the other two sate there
                  unhappily enough. In about an hour they noticed that it began to grow dark; and
                  looking up saw a storm gathering above the crest of the mountain. As they watched
                  it with alarm, Ardens approached and said roughly—</p>
               <p>"If you don't want to be swept away by the storm you had better not waste your
                  time here."</p>
               <p>"What ails you Ardens?" cried his'sister, "why do you speak and act so
                  roughly?"</p>
               <p>"I am not to account to you, for what I do," he answered, "and I won't be schooled
                  like a child by you."</p>
               <p>The girls' clear eyes grew very sad; and sadder when they saw his medal dull and
                  leaden in color.</p>
               <p>"Brother look at your medal!" she said, putting out her hand and taking hold of
                  it.</p>
               <p>"Let the medal alone, will you? and mind your own business," he said, and struck
                  her hand aside.</p>
               <p>But he struck away more than Fida's hand. His own caught in the slight ribbon
                  about his neck and sent the medal flying across the road and into the rift
                  opposite. He sprang after it, in time to see it sink slowly into the unctuous
                  black mass at the bottom. Then all his loss rushed upon him at once, and his heart
                  grew dead within him. His causeless wrath, his rude manners and his brutality
                  stood clear before him. He seized the Mirror and gave one long look in it. Was
                  that the bright glorified face that shone amid the golden mists on the mountain
                  top? Black, ugly, distorted; with a wolf glare in the eyes, pale lips and wrinkled
                  forehead. He threw the Mirror from him, and Fida caught it before it fell.</p>
               <p>"Go," he shouted! "leave me to the storm; it is for me, and I am accursed. Away,
                  lest it dash you into death with me! I have nothing more to do with you! Never
                  shall I see your faces again; never touch the hand of little Peace; never, never
                  reach the House of Gold."</p>
               <p>He turned, and with a gesture of despair fled up the mountain to meet the coming
                  storm. Little Peace was weeping bitterly. Then the mountain thunder crashed
                  furiously above them; an eagle with a young lamb in his gripe screamed as it
                  swooped close over them, flying low to avoid the storm; Lolo caught up the child,
                  Fida the knapsack, and full of terror they fled, fast as they might, down the side
                  of the mountain.</p>
               <p>But the storm broke and spent its strength above them, and they got off with the
                  fright. So sadly, silently and bereaved they entered the lodge at the foot of the
                  mountain, and saw stretching away before them a blank and flowerless desert of
                  yellow sand.</p>
               <p>All that night, little Peace lay in restless fever,<pb n="126-127"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000070"/> and moaned and cried in her sleep for Ardent. And
                  when at last in the grey of the morning she grew quiet, it was too late for the
                  others, to take any rest. And so when the child awaked and seemed somewhat better,
                  the others wearied and hollow-eyed with watching prepared to start. The Mirror
                  shewed them merely a darker line running, straight and apparently interminable,
                  across the sands. Mournful indeed were the voices of the poor children as they
                  uttered their prayer that morning.</p>
               <lg type="stanza">
                  <l>Father! lend a gracious ear!</l>
                  <l rend="ti-1">Dark the forest shadows blend,</l>
                  <l>Steep the peaks their crests uprear,</l>
                  <l rend="ti-1">Wide the desert sands extend.</l>
                  <l>Guard us to our destined seat,</l>
                  <l>Nerve and guide our pilgrim feet.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>"Oh, little Peace, you are very light this morning!" said Lolo as he took her
                  up.</p>
               <p>The child put her arms round his neck and nestled her face close down beside his,
                  but she made no answer, and so guided only by the sun towards whose rising the
                  Mirror directed, they left the last patch of vegetation, and walked forth into the
                  desert. At first the sand lay close and hard and they made good progress; but as
                  the sun rose higher in the Heavens, it became loose and their feet sank in it, and
                  they were very weary. Often they sate down to rest, and as often rose and moved
                  painfully on. The boy still keeping his burden in his arms and chatting to her
                  pleasantly, and she raising her hand to caress his cheek occasionally or her face
                  to give him a smile.</p>
               <p>But when it lacked about an hour to noon this ceased, and Lolo supposing her
                  asleep had not spoken for some time, but plodded patiently on, with Fida following
                  steadily. Then as the girl looked up, she uttered a cry of pain.</p>
               <p>"Oh! look at little Peace!"</p>
               <p>The child's head had turned upon her brother's shoulder, and the little face, pale
                  as snow, was exposed. The sweet eyes were closed, and the features looked
                  sharpened.</p>
               <p>"Lolo, our little Sister is dying!"</p>
               <p>They laid her gently down upon the sand and knelt beside her. The long march, the
                  terrors of the forest, the fatigue of the mountain had been too much for the
                  slight, delicate frame, and the loss of Ardens had broken her little heart. There
                  she lay scarcely breathing now, the pale lips apart and dry; the eye half closed,
                  a low moan straggling now and then from the laboring chest. Her cold, small hands
                  were crossed upon her bosom.</p>
               <p>Then a sweet, gentle light spread round them,<pb n="128-129"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000071"/> and they saw great clusters of roses and lilies and
                  violets about them almost at the head of the child, and over these hung gauzy
                  clouds like a curtain dropped from the arch of Heaven, and through its filmy azure
                  beamed soft and silver light. And the curtain parted, and they saw a path, gentle
                  and winding leading up a hill. And the hill was a mass of cool, green woods and
                  flowers of unearthly hue and richest fragrance, and clear bright fountains fell
                  from mossy rocks, and the drops sparkled like stars.</p>
               <p>And on the summit of the hill, stood a glorious Palace of stateliest architecture,
                  covered with delicate and marvellous sculpture and all of beaten gold. And at its
                  doors and in its courts and on the pathway thither thronged white robed, white
                  winged beings of singular, pure loveliness to look upon. And bursts of choral
                  music, of unimaginable melody made the air tremble with delight and died away
                  softly as into distance, and rose and fell and died away again.</p>
               <p>Then the great portals opened, and there came forth, down the broad, burnished
                  steps and down the blossoming hill a Child. A crown of blood red roses was on His
                  brow, roses were in His hands and on His tender feet. And His beauty was
                  ineffable, and His eyes were full of the deep rapture of calm perpetual joy. And
                  as. He moved, the white winged Angels knelt and gazed upon Him with perfect love.
                  And he came to the children, and in a voice so sweet that it thrilled their
                  hearts, He said,</p>
               <p>"Come, little Peace!"</p>
               <p>And Peace was aroused; her face grew lovelier than ever any one had seen it as she
                  fixed her large violet eyes upon the Child. But Fida and her brother burst into a
                  passion of tears.</p>
               <p>"Leave us not, little Peace!" they said, "stay with us yet a while. Leave us not
                  desolate in the drear, drear desert!"</p>
               <p>But she put up her arms and drew their faces down to hers and kissed them,
                  murmuring, "Good bye! good bye!" Then she rose and said gently,</p>
               <p>"I will go with the beautiful Child." And so she placed her little hand in His,
                  and they went up the pathway of the blossoming hill, and then entered the portals
                  of the House of Gold, and the doors were shut. Then the mist shrouded Palace and
                  hill, and the hot sun of noonday dissipated the mist, and there was no Palace, no
                  hill, no beautiful rose marked Child, no little Peace upon the earth. But there
                  were only two children, with broken hearts, kneeling lone upon the sands of the
                  drear, drear desert.</p>
               <p>An hour and then another passed away, and the first bitterness of their weeping
                  was over, but they<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC7182-00000072"/> felt crushed and
                  hopeless, and soon a severe thirst made itself felt, and they had nothing to
                  quench it.</p>
               <p>"Rouse up, Lolo! what are we to do?"</p>
               <p>The boy looked at his sister with lustreless eye, and answered,</p>
               <p>"We are to perish here, now, I suppose. Ardens is lost, and Peace is gone; I
                  cannot do anything now."</p>
               <p>"We shall die of thirst if we stay here," said the girl.</p>
               <p>"Yes, I suppose so!" he answered listlessly, "and see, our medals are getting
                  dull; we shall never reach the Golden House."</p>
               <p>Then they threw themselves upon the sand, and abandoned themselves again to grief.
                  But a gentle voice aroused them. They looked up and saw a Lady, with a radiant
                  presence and a sweet motherly smile.</p>
               <p>"What do ye here, my children?"</p>
               <p>They told her of all their pilgrimage, and how they had been deprived first of
                  their brother who was their strength and courage, and then of their little sister
                  who was their consolation.</p>
               <p>"Nay," said the Lady, "do not rob me of my titles. That is a name which my
                  subjects have given to me. I am called Consoler of the Afflicted."</p>
               <p>Fida looked earnestly in her face and said: "Yes, I believe that you can help us."
                  Then she threw herself upon her knees, and with clasped hands and streaming eyes
                  continued, "Oh, Lady, do help us; we are poor, friendless young children; we have
                  lost all that we had on earth, our Ardens and our Peace. Now we have no hope but
                  in you."</p>
               <p>The boy said nothing, but he knelt down beside his sister and kissed the hem of
                  the Lady's azure robe.</p>
               <p>"Where were you going?" asked the gentle voice.</p>
               <p>"To seek the beautiful House of Gold, which stands on the mountain of God,"</p>
               <p>"And where has your little sister gone? Would you have her here to share in your
                  sufferings and to have all the broad desert still to cross. Was she not worn out
                  and ill, and full of pain? And are you sorry because she has got home before
                  you?"</p>
               <p>They had not thought of it in this way, and hung their heads. Then the Lady laid
                  her fair hands upon them, and from the soft, white fingers there seemed to pour
                  energy and consolation and strength. The weariness left their hearts, the
                  lassitude their limbs. They sprang up refreshed, and as they did so, saw that
                  their medals sparkled bright again.</p>
               <p>"Come, Lolo; come!" said Fida, "on, away from the setting sun; that is our course.
                  It is warm now, and a night's sleep on the sands wont hurt us."</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC7182-00000073"/>
               <p>"Do you not look at your Mirror?" asked the Lady. They did so, and saw therein the
                  strait dark line across the yellow plain, and on it, at, no very great distance, a
                  cluster of trees shading a spot of brilliant green, and, sparkling in the midst of
                  the verdure, a silver fountain.</p>
               <p>"Is the way long, from thence?" Lolo asked timidly.</p>
               <p>"For those who guide themselves, it is long and perilous; but you have your
                  Mirror, do not forget to consult it"</p>
               <p>"And Ardens! shall he reach the Golden House at last?"</p>
               <p>A smile of tender beauty illumined the Lady's face, and from her lips fell the one
                  sweet word,</p>
               <p>"Hope!" Then as they looked the azure mantle seemed to infold her, and to grow
                  paler in its tints, and so to mix imperceptibly with the air, and they were alone.
                  Then with good will and earnest purpose the children set their faces toward the
                  Orient.</p>
               <p>Let us go back to Ardens. He had rushed upward toward the storm; not far however,
                  for the way was steep and the descending clouds met him. At first he took a wild
                  pleasure in battling against the wind, but soon the crashing thunder and the glare
                  of the levin dizieed and dazzled him, and the rain torrents, mingled with sharp
                  sleet and hail as ever in mountain showers, drenched and chilled him. His fury
                  passed, and a feeling of horror and desolation took possession of him. He returned
                  to the rift into which his angry hand had dashed his medal, and there he threw
                  himself, down upon the hard rock and gave way to passionate regrets. Then Pride
                  would suggest excuses, and he would spring up and pace back and forward, arguing
                  the matter until grief got the better of him, when he would throw himself upon his
                  face again despairingly. And so the day and the long night passed, until nature
                  was exhausted, and he slept.</p>
               <p>When he awoke, the shepherd was standing at his feet, leaning upon his staff and
                  looking at him. The old man's face was very grave and sad.</p>
               <p>"I came," he said, "to search for lost lambs, as is my custom after storms like
                  yesterday's. But I did not expect to find your here, and thus. Where are your
                  sisters and your brother?"</p>
               <p>Ardens could only murmur hoarsely that they had gone on their way.</p>
               <p>"And why are you here? and thus?"</p>
               <p>The boy looked at him for a moment earnestly; then a better feeling than he had
                  yet had passed<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC7182-00000074"/> into his mind, and
                  throwing himself at the old man's feet, he said, with sobs,</p>
               <p>"Oh hear me sir, and I will tell you all!"</p>
               <p>The good old man sate down and took in his own the hands of the kneeling Ardens,
                  and listened patiently as the boy poured forth his confession. He described his
                  errors in the forest, how he had been sorry for them, but in an impulsive sort of
                  way which left no memory of them. Then how he had turned all his well doing on the
                  day before into an occasion of pride; how his pride had been nursed into fury,
                  until his own hand had flung away his medal; "and now," he said, with a burst of
                  passionate grief, "now it is all over, I shall never see them again. I shall never
                  reach the Golden House!"</p>
               <p>But the old man spoke tenderly to him, and told him that however bad one's faults
                  may have been that despair was a worse one than any. That hearty sorrow for the
                  past and a firm purpose for the future would set his heart right again.</p>
               <p>"And now," he continued, "go thou, my son, cautiously, and warily down the sides
                  of the rift, and pull up for me from the miry pool, the tallest reed. Ardens
                  obeyed, though with great difficulty, for his hold upon the rocks was very
                  precarious, and the first pull he gave to the reed, its sharp flint-edged leaves
                  cut his hand to the bone. But he persevered until it gave way, and then he brought
                  it, and kneeling down offered it to the shepherd.</p>
               <p>But he said with great gentleness, "Look at the roots, my son!"</p>
               <p>Ardens looked, and there twisted round the roots was the soiled ribbon still
                  holding the medal. It was perfectly black, even after the mire had been cleaned
                  off, and as he held it in his hands be began to weep. Lo! the first tear that fell
                  upon the medal as he rubbed it off, took the stain with it. Then he wept half for
                  joy, and rained his tears upon the silver plate until it shone again, not with the
                  diamond splendor it possessed upon the mountain top, but with a subdued but still
                  clear luster.</p>
               <p>"See, sir," he said, "it is bright again!"</p>
               <p>The old man laid his hand upon his head and blest him. He strung his medal upon a
                  new ribbon, not a white one as before but a purple one for memory and mourning, he
                  gave him his own scrip with a store of food, and said, "Go now, my child, and
                  overtake the others, but sin no more, lest a worse thing happen thee."</p>
               <p>Then Ardens kissed the old man's hand, and with renewed courage and hope, but
                  grave withal, ho descended the mountain at a rapid pace.</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC7182-00000075"/>
               <p>Fida and her brother had reached the oasis before nightfall, and there they slept.
                  And in the morning they saw that ripe dates hung clustering from the palm tree,
                  and they resolved to rest there all the day, and to start at nightfall and travel
                  by the cool light of stars.</p>
               <p>And as they began to make their preparations for starting they saw a figure
                  rapidly advancing towards them. Nearer and nearer he came, until they recognized
                  him and ran and fell upon his neck and kissed him. Humbly he begged their pardon,
                  but they would hear nothing of that, but loaded him with caresses and led him to
                  the green shadow of the palms.</p>
               <p>As he rested there for half-an-hour they told him of little Peace, but he only
                  murmured, "It is just, I did not deserve the sight."</p>
               <p>Fida wondered that he neither wept nor expressed any regret for little Peace, and
                  he seemed to divine her thought, for he said, "That his only feeling for Peace was
                  one of loving joy; that his sorrow was for himself; that he had been unworthy to
                  share that glorious vision with them."</p>
               <p>Then they noticed how much changed he was. That it was no longer the same Ardens;
                  he looked strong and well, but the rich color had gone from his cheek, and his
                  face was thin and grave. They knew then that he was a man now, for he had passed
                  through a great personal sorrow. So they tacitly acquiesced, as he bound all the
                  burdens upon his own shoulders, and just as the sun set, they said their prayer
                  and started.</p>
               <p>It was a very hard walk, for they sank in the sand at every step; the water they
                  had brought with them was soon exhausted, and they suffered from burning thirst;
                  their eyes were dry and feverish, and the fine drifting dust inflamed them
                  painfully. The younger ones complained a little, but Ardens never murmured, and
                  indeed only opened his lips to utter some words of grave, kind encouragement.</p>
               <p>So they toiled on till midnight, and then they heard the rushing sound of water,
                  and a few steps brought them to the banks of a swift, dark rolling stream. They
                  held up their Mirror to the starlight and saw that the road lay directly through
                  the turbulent, gloomy water, and that the other shore was veiled in clouds.</p>
               <p>Ardens stood on the bank with a strange look in his dark eves; and Lolo shuddered
                  and shrunk from the shore, but Fida said,</p>
               <p>"Come brothers, we shall pass in safety for the road is there."</p>
               <pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC7182-00000076"/>
               <p>"You may go safely," murmured Ardens, "and you too, Lolo, if you will take
                  courage."</p>
               <p>"We will all go together," said the girl.</p>
               <p>Then Ardens threw down his burdens, and taking a firm clasp of each others hands
                  the three children entered the cold, dark flood. It eddied swift and strong around
                  them and chilled them to the heart, but they clung firmly to each other, and went
                  On. And when they had passed, nearly over, the clouds that veiled the shore broke
                  away, and revealed a land of surpassing beauty such as their eye had never
                  seen.</p>
               <p>Broad meadow lands enammelled with rich flowers, green slopes and knolls crowned
                  with tall shadowy-tufted palms or drooping larches, cool woods that stretched away
                  in green arcades, and leaping rills and fountains, and tall, majestic mountains
                  purple with perpetual bloom, and glad with golden splendor far lovelier than the
                  sun's.</p>
               <p>And on the mountain stood the House of Gold.</p>
               <p>Then they saw an Angel on the bank of the river who stood waiting it seemed to
                  help them. And when they reached the bank Ardens stretched up his hand, but the
                  Angel did not touch it, but beckoned to Lolo and said,</p>
               <p>"Thou first, my brother."</p>
               <p>Ardens drew back and muttered, "That, too, is just."</p>
               <p>Then the Angel drew Lolo up the bank, and so soon as his foot touched the herbage,
                  he grew beautiful as the Angel; and the Angel said,</p>
               <p>"Help thou the others! It is by thee, Humility, that they must enter this
                  kingdom."</p>
               <p>Then the boy turned his radiant face to them and drew them up, and they walked up
                  the mountain path, and on the terrace of that House of Gold stood the beautiful
                  Child. Blood red roses were on. His forehead, roses were on His hands, roses on
                  His tender feet, and little Peace sate at His feet. Then as they walked, the
                  Angels guiding them began a song, and others took it up, and the whole land rung
                  with unutterable harmony, as the pilgrims entered home.</p>

               <head>ISSACHAR BEN DAOUD.</head>
               <p>ISSACHAE BEN DAOUD came out from his house in the Street of the Merchants, and
                  walked slowly towards the Eastern Quarter of Jerusalem. The day was dark and
                  lowering: the wind blew chill from the frosty summit of Mount Moriah and pierced
                  through his dark robe, and tossed his reverend beard as he walked directly in the
                  teeth of it. Issachar hurried along, for it was not good for a Hebrew to tarry in
                  the streets of the city of his fathers; for the green flag of Mahomet floated over
                  the towers and the governor, Yuseff Ali, was the representative of the Caliph
                  Omar.</p>
               <p>Sometimes he would make way for a haughty Saracen, who would spit at him and call
                  him "dog" as he passed; sometimes he would meet a Christian, who, if less haughty
                  than the Moslem yet shrank from him as though there were contamination in the
                  touch of his garments, or again it would be one of his own people who would press
                  his hands to his bosom, and to the muttered salutation of Issachar, "the Peace of
                  the God of Israel be with thee," would murmur the reply, "And on thee be
                  peace."</p>
               <p>Past all these however, the Israelite went on until he reached the quarter of the
                  city which is called Bezetha, the "New City," and the gate which leads out upon
                  the road to Bethphage and Bethany. Here erected against and overlooking the walls,
                  was a strongly fortified house built by some great officer of the Emperor
                  Heraclius in the year 630, and now, A.D, 638, inhabited by Yuseff Ali.</p>
               <p>As Issachar approached the gate of the outer court of this house, a fierce
                  sentinel who stood there touched him rudely with the butt of his spear,
                  saying,</p>
               <p>"Now, dog Jew! how darest thou approach so closely?"</p>
               <p>The Hebrew expressed his desire to see the governor.</p>
               <p>Thou see the lord Yuseff!" shouted the soldier, "thou abomination!"</p>
               <p>"But the lord governor hath sent for me, and required me to be here at this hour,"
                  said Issachar humbly."</p>
               <p>"Then why camest thou not sooner, thou scum of Eblis" asked the inconsistent
                  warrior. "Ho, Mustapha, conduct this child of Satan to my lord;<pb n="148-149"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000081"/> and hark ye, send me a pitcher of sherbet that I
                  may wash my lips from the pollution of having spoken to him."</p>
               <p>To such and far worse outrages the Hebrews of Jerusalem were constantly subjected.
                  All their holy places were defiled, or possessed by others, their name had become
                  a bye-word and a scoff, themselves the mark for the insolence of the Mahomedan
                  rabble, for extortion and oppression by the chiefs. So it was with a quaking heart
                  that Issachar Ben Daoud followed the servant into the presence of Yuseff. He knew
                  that the visit could bring no good to him, for a Hebrew was never thus summoned,
                  unless he happened to be a physician, but for his own misfortune.</p>
               <p>Yuseff sat upon a richly cushioned divan, playing with the jewelled hilt of one of
                  those precious sabres for which Damascus was even then famous. Behind him stood
                  two tall and powerful Ethiopian mutes. On a small stand before him were a jar of
                  sherbet and some grapes and dates in a basket of silver filigree. His full beard
                  gave to the Saracen's well featured face, an effect of noble gravity, and his
                  appearance was pleasant and even inviting until the cold black depth of his eye
                  was noticed or felt. Lowly bowed Issachar, raising his hands to his forehead and
                  uttering the oriental <foreign xml:lang="ARA">Salaam,</foreign> and he remained
                  with his head bent until it pleased Yuseff to break the silence.</p>
               <p>"So, Hebrew, thou hast obeyed my summons. So far, so well! I trust to find thee as
                  punctual in all things. Dost thou know why I have sent for thee?"</p>
               <p>"No, my lord," said Issachar, "nor have I striven to guess, I hurried hither at
                  once in obedience."</p>
               <p>"Humph! doubtless a most loyal and ready servant, and one deserving of confidence.
                  Thou shalt have it. Know then, O Issachar, son of David, that the Pasha of
                  Damascus hath received a letter from the commander of the Faithful, whom may Allah
                  long preserve, demanding a million of gold modurs. Thou openest thine eyes, O
                  Israelite,"</p>
               <p>"Truly, my lord, the gold is much."</p>
               <p>"Not so much," continued Yuseff with a benignant smile, "when fitly apportioned.
                  This ancient city of thy people, upon whose beards be defilement! is, as thou
                  knowest, in the Pashalik of Damascus, and to my share hath fallen the duty of
                  collecting one quarter of the sum. Now thou knowest that the wealthy Christians
                  have fled; and that there remains only the Beni-Ibrahim to enjoy the honor of
                  contributing to the wants of the Caliph. So I have selected you——."</p>
               <p>"Me!" groaned out Issachar, clasping his hands!<pb n="150-151"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000082"/> "Me to pay two hundred and fifty thousand modurs!
                  As well, O Governor, ask me for the signet ring of Solomon."</p>
               <p>"Patience, good Issachar. Four of thy brethren shall share the burden."</p>
               <p>"If there were fifty, merciful Yuseff, it were the same. Gold have I none, save
                  what little supplies the wants of my household."</p>
               <p>"What, thou hast no gold! Art thou not Cohen of the Synagogue?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, effendi, but it bringeth no emolument. It is an office which goes from
                  father to son in thy servant's poor family."</p>
               <p>"And thou hast no treasure," continued the pitiless Governor, fixing his cold
                  black eye upon the Jew. "What keepest thou in the box of acaccia wood hooped round
                  and ringed with fine gold!"</p>
               <p>A shudder passed over the frame of the Israelite; his face grew deadly pale and he
                  trembled.</p>
               <p>"I am well informed, am I not?" said Yuseff.</p>
               <p>Indeed I could tell thee yet more. Three times a day dost thou visit thy treasure,
                  and on thy Sabbath dost spend nearly all the day locked up with it. Thou must
                  unlock the precious casket for me, Issachar.</p>
               <p>"I swear to thee, my lord," answered the pallid and quaking Hebrew, "that there is
                  naught therein precious in thy sight. I am poor, good Governor, I have no
                  treasures; have mercy and tell me that I am free."</p>
               <p>"Thou art free to go thy ways now," was the cold answer. "But if thou bring me not
                  thy quota before the noon to-morrow, thy casket will be here by nightfall, and
                  then I take all. And now begone and thank thy fate that I have spared thy
                  head."</p>
               <p>Crushed to the earth, broken in spirit and half distracted, Issachar Ben Daoud
                  went out from the presence of the governor. As he passed along the streets,
                  everything remindent him of the degradation of his race: everywhere were the marks
                  of the spoiler Ismaelite. He stopped at a deserted fountain to get a draught of
                  water. It had been placed by the Christians under the protection of the Blessed
                  Virgin, and her mutilated statue still stood upon the summit of the central
                  pillar.</p>
               <p>"And thou, too," said the Jew, not without respect, "thou too wert and Hebrew
                  maiden and a daughter of David. But the hand of the spoiler hath laid thy sceptre
                  in the dust, and the Prophet, thy Son, hath not sheltered thine image."</p>
               <p>Then he continued on homewards; and when he entered his house he put aside with a
                  motion of his hand those who would have addressed him, and rending his robe, he
                  sprinkled ashes on his head<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC7182-00000083"/> and sate
                  down upon the ground in the small courtyard of his house.</p>
               <p>He had kept his melancholy position for perhaps half-an-hour when he was aroused
                  by the touch of gentle hands upon his neck, and a young girl bending over pressed
                  her lips upon his forehead.</p>
               <p>"What aileth my father that he sits thus in desolation?" asked the young girl.</p>
               <p>The old man bent his head still lower and murmured, "Ichabod! my glory has
                  departed."</p>
               <p>She sate down beside him saying, simply, "We will lament together," and taking his
                  hand in her's she began to speak in a low sweet voice. She recalled, as if
                  sorrowing for their loss, the ancient glories of Israel, made more illustrious by
                  the hope of Messiah; she spoke of the captivity when their fathers sate weeping by
                  the waters of Babylon, and used the sad, beautiful words of the poet Jeremias; but
                  she spoke also of the comfort in the hope of Messias. And then she recalled the
                  rebuilding of the temple and the promise of the seventy weeks; and then she
                  exulted in the prowess of the Asmoneans, that last flicker of the lamp of Judah's
                  glory, and murmured the prophecies of the later Prophets, foretelling the new and
                  everlasting Oblation.</p>
               <p>"Behold," she said, "my father, the seventy weeks are passed and where is Messias?
                  When will He come?"</p>
               <p>The old man only sighed.</p>
               <p>" Perhaps," she continued, "He hath come. The sceptre and the lawgiver have
                  departed from Judah. Is not Shiloh already here?"</p>
               <p>He raised his eyes and looked fixedly at her. And there was a strange light of
                  exultation in her face, for one who was mourning over the griefs of Zion.</p>
               <p>"Listen to me, Miriam," he said. "Thou knowest how powerful and wealthy we once
                  were. Of the tribe of the poet king himself, and holding possessions worthy of out
                  ancestry and rank, and now thou knowest, my daughter, that I have but the Ark and
                  thee. Spoiled by Roman and Galilean and Saracen of riches and of place; robbed by
                  death of thy mother and of my only son, the Ark and thou alone are left. Left for
                  how long?" Then he told her of Yuseff's summons, of their interview and its
                  results; and then he beat his breast and muttered, "God of my father, why have I
                  seen this day!"</p>
               <p>"But hast thou no treasure in this Ark, my father?"</p>
               <p>He looked at her in momentary surprise; but then said,</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC7182-00000084"/>
               <p>"Ah, it is true. I forgot that thou had'st never been told. Thou knowest, Miriam,
                  that the Ark of the Covenant which contained the tables of the Law, and Aaron's
                  rod that budded, and an Omer of that Manna wherewith Adonai fed our fathers, was
                  lost at the Captivity. The Chaldeans carried it off with the plunder of the
                  Temple; nor was it seen any more among us. Then was this Ark of mine made, from
                  accacia wood like the former, in the same shape, and in it was placed a transcript
                  of the Law written by the hands of the Prophet Esdras himself. It was intended for
                  the new temple but was not used. Yet hath it ever the veneration of Israel as a
                  memorial and type of the Ark of the Covenant by that venerable name it is known,
                  and it is our most precious and our only relic of the times that have passed. It
                  is to thy father's honor that its keeping is by right attached. Oh, yes, it is a
                  treasure richer than Tarshish, more precious than the secret of the Tyrian dye. It
                  is hallowed by the love and memories of our fathers. It is the symbol of Jehovah's
                  presence as still with us, and, Oh Miriam, it is stained with the blood of thy
                  brother Simeon, for he died in saving it, at the taking of the city. If my blood
                  could save it, joyfully would I shed it, for that Ark is the treasure of my
                  soul."</p>
               <p>Again the exultant flush passed over the beauti- ful face of the Hebrew girl, and
                  her lips parted as if to speak; but she repressed the thoughts that rose within
                  her, and applied herself to cheer her father. She persuaded him to rise and take
                  some food, and whispered that he might find help among their brethren.</p>
               <p>So when the aged Issachar had eaten and drunk, he was refreshed, and taking
                  courage he said,</p>
               <p>"Yes, Miriam, I will go forth. Peradventure there may be wealth enough yet among
                  our people, and they will not see the Ark in danger of pollution from the hands of
                  the heathen."</p>
               <p>So Issachar blessed his daughter, and took his staff and went forth. And Miriam
                  went to her own chamber and drew the bolt across the door, and going to a small
                  table, she unlocked and opened a small box that lay thereon. When the lid was set
                  open it shewed the sweet face of a Woman, glorified by an air almost of divinity,
                  and crowned with stars. And from the box Miriam drew forth a carved wooden
                  Crucifix and a string of palm wood beads, and kneeling down, she prayed, and at
                  the end of every decade she said,</p>
               <p>"Oh, Ark of the Covenant, obtain for me the soul of my father!"</p>
               <p>For Miriam was a Christian. In the taking of the city by the troops of Omer, a
                  Convent of Basi-<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC7182-00000085"/> lian nuns was set on
                  fire, and its unfortunate inmates killed or hunted through the streets. Three of
                  them had found refuge with the benevolent old Israelite. Two of them had
                  afterwards safely escaped from the city; but the third, being in ill health, had
                  lingered with her protectress, and in the house of Issachar she died. The Jew,
                  whose disposition was gentle and kind, had even permitted a, priest to visit the
                  dying woman with the last consolations of religion, and he had baptized Miriam,
                  long since converted and instructed by her grateful friend. Of this, of course,
                  Issachar, was still ignorant.</p>
               <p>Late in the night, wearied and disappointed, the old man returned to his house,
                  Yuseff had but too certain information as to where the wealth lay among the
                  Hebrews; and those from whom Issachar hoped for help, were precisely the persons
                  chosen by the Governor to pillage. Some were unable to meet the demand and were in
                  despair; those who were rich enough to pay the exaction of the Turk, could or
                  would do no more. Issachar had represented his complete distress and the peril of
                  the Ark in vain. His distress they could only remedy by assuming it; and they had
                  not the feeling for his treasure that he, its hereditary guardian, had.</p>
               <p>So the poor old man passed the night in vigil and prayer, and renewed his attempts
                  in the morning.</p>
               <p>But the morning passed away, the noonday came, and Issachar Ben Daoud, penniless
                  and wretched, returned to his house to wait there for what might arrive.</p>
               <p>An hour before sunset he was aroused by a terrific servant, who informed him that
                  a guard of Saracen soldiers was at the gate. He rose with a shudder, and went
                  humbly to meet them. They had obtained entrance at the same moment, and he met
                  them in the little enclosed courtyard.</p>
               <p>"Ah, my lord," he said, as he recognised Yuseff, "what an honor for my poor
                  house."</p>
               <p>"Yes, is it not?" was the cold reply. "Lead the way in, Jew."</p>
               <p>Poor Issachar trembled and obeyed, They went into the chief room of the house, and
                  Yuseff seated himself upon the divan, after one of his attendants had spread a
                  rich robe over it. The soldiers guarded the doors. The Hebrew stood bowed before
                  him.</p>
               <p>"Well, is the money ready?" asked the Governor, and the Hebrew fell upon his
                  knees.</p>
               <p>"Mercy!" he said, my lord. "I have begged of all my people with prayers and tears,
                  and I could<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC7182-00000086"/> borrow nothing, and I have
                  nothing beyond daily bread."</p>
               <p>"Spare thyself, and above all, spare Me these old excuses. I know thy tribe, and
                  may not be deceived. Produce the money or take the consequences."</p>
               <p>"I swear to thee, my lord" cried Issachar, "by the God of my fathers, that I speak
                  but the truth. Though thou should'st kill me, I have nothing."</p>
               <p>Yuseff made a sign to his soldiers, and all but one at each door way left the
                  room. In a few moments the crashing of wood was heard; then came a shriek. The Jew
                  sprang to the inner door, but was confronted by a naked sabre, and fell back. Then
                  two soldiers came in, one bearing in his hands the beloved and precious Ark of the
                  Covenant, as Issachar loved to call it. It was a very small but perfect model of
                  that made long ago, by the Divine command.</p>
               <p>Issachar sprang towards it, and spread his arms over it embracingly.</p>
               <p>"So, we have found thy treasure" said the Governor. "Open that coffer at
                  once,"</p>
               <p>The Jew tore his thin hair and venerable beard. "Kill me," he said, "but touch not
                  this. It is a holy thing."</p>
               <p>"Open it, I bid thee," repeated Yuseff, "or my soldiers shall find a rough key,"
                  and as he spoke, a tall Saracen, with a vast mace in his hand, drew near.</p>
               <p>Again the Jew threw himself upon his knees, but Yuseff merely signed to the
                  soldier, who advanced a step. At that moment two others entered the apartment with
                  Miriam.</p>
               <p>"Another treasure we have found, O Yuseff!" cried one. "One that will grace thy
                  harem."</p>
               <p>Issachar became transfigured with rage. He forgot his old age, his humility, his
                  habitude of sufferance. At a bound he reached his daughter's side, and with the
                  strength of anger he caught and whirled one of the soldiers across the room. But
                  before the hopelessness of his position his anger fell. What could he do against
                  so many.</p>
               <p>"Thou hast another treasure to ransom, or to bestow upon the faithful," said the
                  cold voice of the Mahomedan.</p>
               <p>The old man stood in mute despair. Slowly he turned his dulled eyes from the Ark
                  to his daughter, from her to the Ark again. So absolute and perfect was his
                  distress that it moved even the stony Governor.</p>
               <p>"Hark ye," he said, "Thou shall not call me pitiless. I know thee and I know thy
                  race: grasping, avaricious, loving gold only less than life, more<pb n="160-161"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000087"/> than exemption from torments. I know thee rich, and
                  tax thee no more than thou deservest Now mark. In pure pity and commiseration I
                  extend the time to make up thy mind to part with thy cherished gold, until
                  to-morrow; and if then thou art not ready, I swear by the beard of the Prophet,
                  that I will take all thy treasure, and will place thy child in my harem. Thou
                  knowest that I keep my word!"</p>
               <p>Rising from the divan, and beckoning his attendants, the Moslem with a warning
                  glance at his victims retired. Issachar sank down beside his beloved Ark, crashed
                  almost into annihilation.</p>
               <p>His daughter drew near him, and asked if there were indeed no help to be had from
                  his brethren.</p>
               <p>"No, Miriam," he groaned, "there is no help in man; and God hath hidden His face,
                  and His ear is not open to my cry,"</p>
               <p>Miriam's face flushed, and her eyes filled with light as she said, "Nay, my
                  father, thou knowest not the depth of His loving pity: with Him is plenteous
                  redemption. Oh, my Father, my soul even now is full of consolation and confidence
                  and hope."</p>
               <p>"Thine, Miriam? whence dost thou draw it?"</p>
               <p>"From Him, my father, from the Promised, from the Hope of Israel. From Him whom
                  our fathers slew and hung upon the Cross."</p>
               <p>The old man started and stared at her in amazement; but she continued
                  fervently,</p>
               <p>"Yes, my hope is in Jesus of Nazareth; last king of David's royal line and God
                  incarnate in the flesh. Turn unto Him, father, and through His blessed Mother He
                  will save us."</p>
               <p>"The maiden is mad and blasphemeth," said the old man distractedly.</p>
               <p>"No, father, I am not mad. Turn to that-Hebrew maiden, to Mary now crowned and
                  throned in Heaven," and as she spoke she kneeled down before him, and would have
                  taken his hands, but ho repulsed her.</p>
               <p>"Be not angry," she continued, but hear me. "Thou hast set thine heart for years
                  on yonder wooden box, on yonder copy of the law, because it is a model of that
                  which was in the Temple. But what was even that, when safe in the Holy of Holies,
                  compared to Mary. It held the tables of the law, but Mary's bosom the Master of
                  the law; it kept the Manna, whereof our fathers ate and died, but Mary's bosom
                  held the life-giving Bread which giveth life eternal; that kept the blossoming rod
                  of Aaron, but Mary bore the rod of Jesse, the Christ, the Saviour."</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC7182-00000088"/>
               <p>He looked at her with horror.</p>
               <p>"So then," he said, hoarsely, "you are——."</p>
               <p>"A Christian? yes, my father, and have a Christian's hope, a Christian's
                  confidence."</p>
               <p>He signed to her to leave him; but she drew closer to his knees.</p>
               <p>"Away," he said. "It lacked but this; an apostate daughter. Now, I am alone. Away!
                  let me die!"</p>
               <p>"Do not call me Apostate," she said, "my creed is not the destruction but the
                  fulfillment of thine; it is the substance whereof our fathers had the shadow.
                  Think of that, thou, my pious learned father, recall the prophecies of Esaias and
                  the others, thou wilt see that the Virgin born Jesus of Nazareth is indeed 'He
                  that should come.'"</p>
               <p>"Leave me, I command thee!"</p>
               <p>"I go, my father; but for love's sake think of these things. I will go pray for
                  thee."</p>
               <p>She left the apartment, and the old man bowed his face down in his hands and sate
                  there motionless.</p>
               <p>And the day rolled on its course and passed away. The night came on and deepened
                  into midnight, but Issachar Ben Daoud still sate there motionless with his face in
                  his hands.</p>
               <p>Hour followed hour until the chill of the atmosphere heralded the approaching
                  dawn. Then at that hour of deepest darkness he felt a touch upon his shoulder and
                  the low voice of Miriam.</p>
               <p>"Arise, my father, and let us fly."</p>
               <p>He was so stunned and bewildered with grief that he obeyed her like a child. She
                  led him to the door, but when the wind blew in upon him as it was opened he
                  started from her.</p>
               <p>"The Ark, Miriam, the Ark of the Covenant!"</p>
               <p>she ran and brought his treasure to him; he clasped it in his arms, and then
                  taking hold of the sleeve of his robe she led him swiftly away. Across a third of
                  the city; making detours to shun the sentries at the various posts; whispering
                  fear or encouragement whenever his pace lagged, until they began to mount a rather
                  steep and roughly paved narrow street. Tall houses hemmed it in upon both sides,
                  and the cold wind from the hills swept down it in their faces.</p>
               <p>"I am weary, Miriam," he said, "weary and the way is hard."</p>
               <p>"It is the 'Street of Sorrows,' my father. It is the way <emph>He</emph> walked in
                  bearing his Cross."</p>
               <p>The old man shuddered.</p>
               <p>"Every stone in this rough way," continued Miriam, "was wet with His precious
                  Blood. For He was torn with scourges, and pierced with the<pb n="164-165"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000089"/> thorns of is crown. And all for us, my
                  father——."</p>
               <p>She stopped suddenly, and holding him firmly by the arm, bent her ear towards the
                  earth to listen.</p>
               <p>"We are pursued," she cried, "quick, quick father, or the Moslem will overtake
                  us.</p>
               <p>At her voice he started and ran, but the noise increased behind them, the ringing
                  of horse hoofs and the metalic sound of arms. Miriam had been praying earnestly,
                  although in silence, ever since they started from their home; and now with
                  redoubled fervor she urged her petitions. But the sound drew nearer, and as it
                  rang clearly upon his ears, Issachar Ben Daoud stopped.</p>
               <p>"I can go no further,"he said, breathlessly.</p>
               <p>"Let me die here. Save thyself, Miriam, and save the Ark. There is no help."</p>
               <p>"Yes, there is help," she said, "help in our God! Pray to Him, father, call upon
                  Him whose sacred feet were worn on this hard way, and call upon His Mother."</p>
               <p>He paused a moment, and then his child's warm prayers were answered. A flood of
                  grace broke in upon his soul, and he fell upon his knees.</p>
               <p>"Jesus of Nazareth! I confess thee and adore thee. Take me and have pity on my
                  child, O Thou pure Hebrew maiden! Mary, True Ark of the Covenant save us by thy
                  powerful prayers, and I vow to thy service all that I have, my child and this Ark
                  of the Law so long my only treasure except her."</p>
               <p>Nearer came the clang of the pursuers; and with renewed effort Issachar sprang up,
                  and with his daughter's arm in his, ran forward. But in a moment he fell again
                  exhausted. As he touched the hard stones with his knees however, he heard the
                  voice of Miriam,</p>
               <p>"Give thanks to our Lord and Mary, O my father, for we are saved!"</p>
               <p>And as he turned to look where she pointed, he saw a door in one of the houses
                  opened, and a man whom he recognized by his garb as a Christian ecclesiastic. One
                  more effort and he reached the door and saw it closed behind him, but as he sank
                  exhausted upon the floor, he heard the clatter and clash of iron shod hoofs and of
                  armor as the troop swept fiercely past the house in pursuit of them. Then with
                  streaming eyes and folded hands he rose to his knees and poured out his thanks to
                  Mary, the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
               <p>The old man kept his word: he gave both his treasures to our Lady. Miriam found a
                     calm,<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC7182-00000090"/> holy home among the Basilian
                  nuns; and the precious Manuscript of the Law, carefully kept in its little Ark was
                  shewn to the curious and devout, in the Sinaite convent where Issachar Ben Daoud,
                  or Brother Andreas, had ended his mortal life.</p>

               <head>THE REFORMER'S STORY.</head>
               <p>IT was towards the close of a warm day early in the Autumn of AD. 1525, that a
                  Cavalier with two attendants rode towards a small hotel in Niederburg, a village
                  on the Frontier of Silesia, There was nothing inviting in the aspect of the rustic
                  inn, and the traveller's look manifested his disgust.</p>
               <p>"Is there no place but this to stop at, Ulric?" he asked, turning towards one of
                  his attendants.</p>
               <p>"None nearer than Laintz, my lord" answered the man, and that is five stout
                  leagues away.</p>
               <p>"Humph!" said the master, "five leagues; and the beasts are worn out and must have
                  some repose What is that upon the height there? Can we not find shelter
                  there?"</p>
               <p>"No, my lord; it is the Castle which was burned by Muenzer's folk. There is
                  nothing standing but the four walls, and even the enclosure has been so long used
                  for a cattle pen that we could not stop in it."</p>
               <p>"In that case we must make the best of it. Try and find some food and clean litter
                  for the horses. For ourselves we must take soldier's fare or perhaps make a fast
                  day of it."</p>
               <p>"There is no danger of starvation, Herr Hitter," answered Ulric. "These fellows
                  live too near the forest for that."</p>
               <p>As he spoke the host came slowly to the door as if in confirmation of the
                  statement, for he was ruddy and plump. He took off his cap and bade the gentleman
                  and his followers welcome.</p>
               <p>"Can you lodge us and give us something to eat here, mine host?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, my good lord, if a trout from the brook, a bit of venison from the
                  forest, and a cup of fair wine will serve; I have that much to set before
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Good; then we stop," and the Cavalier dismounted, and entered the common room of
                  the inn.</p>
               <p>A couple of stout oaken chairs and a rough table with benches formed the whole
                  furniture. At the lower end of the table a man was seated, with his face concealed
                  in his arms, and leaned upon the board as if asleep. He did not move, when the
                  stranger entered, and the latter throwing himself into one of the chairs, paid but
                  little attention to him.</p>
               <p>Only he noticed his dress which was an odd:<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000093"/> mixture of three estates. Originally half student,
                  half military, its wants, as time produced them, had been supplied from the rough
                  garb of the Silesian peasants.</p>
               <p>"Come, mine host," cried the Ritter, "bestir thyself; see that my knaves take good
                  care of the horses, and do thou move briskly with thy promised supper, for I have
                  ridden long and am famished."</p>
               <p>The landlord bowed and left the room.</p>
               <p>At the sound of the guest's voice, the man at the end of the table had started. He
                  raised his head and fixed a pair of very dark, wearied-looking eyes upon the face
                  of the speaker. His features were well formed but emaciated, and his face of a
                  deadly pallor was made still more ghastly by the careless masses of black hair
                  that hung around it and the black moustache that covered the upper lip.</p>
               <p>His continued gaze at length attracted the attention of the stranger, who after
                  returning the look for a moment said somewhat impatiently,</p>
               <p>"Well, man, what art staring at? Art waiting to be spoken to first? thou lookest
                  not unlike a ghost."</p>
               <p>"I am waiting," was the reply in a hollow, deep voice "to see how long Conrad of
                  Landesauer will look before he recognizes Clement Am Rhyn."</p>
               <p>"What, Clement! is it thou, my old comrade and friend. Thou art changed from thy
                  Heidelberg days, as well as from thy campaigning time."</p>
               <p>"Yes, if sorrow, misfortune, disappointment in the past and hopelessness for the
                  present can change one, I am changed. You look happy enough!"</p>
               <p>"Thank God and our Lady, yes," said the Ritter heartily; "but how have things gone
                  so far wrong with thee. Speak out, man; I am thine oldest as I was thy dearest
                  friend, and by St. Mary of Landesauer, if thou wantest help, I have the best right
                  to offer it."</p>
               <p>Am Rhyn sighed heavily as he answered,</p>
               <p>"Help comes too late, Conrad; but if you care to hear my starless story, I will
                  tell you when you have supped."</p>
               <p>"Nay, but cheer up a bit," said the soldier. "Come, a flaggon of wine will put
                  some heart in thee."</p>
               <p>Am Rhyn shook his head. But the entrance of Landesauer's men prevented his
                  speaking, and that gentleman began to ask him indifferent questions about the
                  interests of the neighborhood.</p>
               <p>The supper over, and the men dismissed, the two old friends drew their chairs
                  together, and Conrad said cheerfully,</p>
               <p>"Well, old companion what hast thou been<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC7182-00000094"
                  /> doing, since we both left the thesis for the sword twelve years ago; twelve is
                  it?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, that is the time since our last meeting, for you, apparently one of joyous
                  advancement into ripe manhood; for me, a path through gloom to despair."</p>
               <p>"Nay, my good friend, look not so darkly on it. Talk away; it will do thee
                  good—thou hast vapors on the brain. Thou should'st have gone with me as I bade
                  thee to the Imperial Court."</p>
               <p>"Ah, friend, you were rich and had an hereditary career before you. I almost poor
                  and altogether without interest."</p>
               <p>"So much the more reason for going with me; my interest was strong enough to carry
                  double. But what have you been doing?"</p>
               <p>"I will make my story as short as possible," said Am Rhyn, "for it is too gloomy
                  to dwell on. You know that I was an orphan. My father I never saw; my mother, only
                  long enough to remember her holding me before an altar whereon stood an image of
                  the Virgin Mary and teaching me a few short prayers. When I knew you at Heidelberg
                  I was the master of an old tumble down fortress on the Upper Rhine, and of a
                  revenue enough to keep me from starvation.</p>
               <p>"I will pass over the bright part of my life, for it had no joy or sorrow unshared
                  by you. When we parted after the fight of Wurzfeldt, I determined to go back to my
                  books. I thought the career of arms less likely to be a successful one, and so I
                  put on the toga once more. In the book world, one heard of nothing but Brother
                  Martin, his Reformation and his influence, so I determined to go to Wittenberg
                  where he was city preacher and hear him.</p>
               <p>"You can imagine the effect of such a man upon me; his learning, his wit, his
                  reckless daring, the rough fascination of his private manners made a conquest of
                  me. The ancient Faith, in which I was little instructed, seemed a tissue of
                  absurdities and tyrannies; it was all swept away by the passionate eloquence of
                  Brother Martin; and what information I afterward obtained was all passed through
                  the medium of my new views. I soon learned that the new master claimed personal
                  infallibility far wider in scope than that of the ancient Church; and that freedom
                  of thought meant only freedom to think as he did. I was the friend of Karlstadt;
                  and seeing what I supposed to be reason in his views, I defended them, and was
                  attacked with a ferocity which I have no talent for enduring.</p>
               <p>"Why make a long story! If Luther wore free to differ with the received system of
                  fifteen hundred years, I surely was not bound to submit my con-<pb n="176-177"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000095"/> science to him. I took refuge with the black or
                  white devil, which ever it were, of Zuingle, and hurled back Brother Martin's
                  thunders. Then the bond of order seemed to be broken in me, and from one absurdity
                  I rushed on to another, until at length I joined Muenzer and his maddened peasants
                  in their wildest and most absurd doctrines and practices."</p>
               <p>Every thing traditional or taught now left me: the inspiration of the moment was
                  my religion. Well, you know the end Martin the Reformer and Apostle of religious
                  liberty stirred up the civil power against us. We were hunted through these
                  mountains and speared or shot down like wolves. We revenged ourselves by burning
                  villages and castles Finally we gathered under the, rainbow standard, half naked,
                  half naked peasants. A few cannon shot would have dispersed our host; but Luther
                  had forbidden this, and the sword was to be the instrument of our conversion.</p>
               <p>And so the end came. We were cut to pieces: our poor peasants, singing a hymn,
                  held out their helpless necks to meet the pitiless sword; and of the thousands
                  upon thousands who had, gathered there, scarce twenty escaped. It was a bloody
                  butchery, and I would curse Luther had he left me a belief in anything to curse
                  him by."</p>
               <p>Conrad von Landesauer crossed himself and muttered a prayer, while Clemens
                  continued,</p>
               <p>"I received eight wounds, but none of them, unfortunately, was mortal. I was
                  carried from the field and concealed in the inmost recesses of the mines. There I
                  lay until my wounds were healed in pitchy darkness, occasionally made visible by
                  the faint gleam of the miner's lamp. A cold slime trickled from the walls and
                  oozed through the floor whereon my pallet lay. The means of healing were few and
                  imperfect and my recovery was protracted. But it came eventually, and I issued
                  forth at last out of the Cimmerian gloom into the sunshine, But my soul was dark,
                  hopelessly dark for ever. And here I sit now, O Conrad, without faith, hope,
                  charity or God,"</p>
               <p>The wretched man covered his face and shuddered as if with an ague.</p>
               <p>After a moment's silence, von Landesauer addressed him,</p>
               <p>"Rouse thyself, old friend, the darkest hour of night is the hour before the
                  dawn."</p>
               <p>Am Rhyn looked at him wildly, and answered,</p>
               <p>"Hopeless, faithless, loveless, Godless—to such a night there is no dawn."</p>
               <p>The soldier rose and began to pace the room in deep thoughtfulness. At last he
                  took a rosary<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC7182-00000096"/> from his bosom and told a
                  decade of the beads. Then kissing the crucifix and medal, he walked up to the
                  wretched Clemens, and slapping him heartily on the shoulder, said,</p>
               <p>"Awake, I tell thee. I have a project and you shall not, even for old love's sake,
                  deny me. Listen, some sixty miles from here, in the mountains of the Bohemian
                  frontier, I have a domain and an old-fashioned castle. Its whole garrison consists
                  of a few old servants and the peasants who till the lands. Thither shall you ride
                  with me tomorrow, and there will I leave you, for I must hasten to Vienna. But
                  there you shall be Seigneur and alone. There you will find employment for boar
                  spear and arbalast bolt, for the forests abound in wild swine, and the fiercest
                  wolves in, Germany haunt the heights. In a couple of months at farthest I will
                  come down with a hunting party and will find you yourself again."</p>
               <p>Am Rhyn shook his head sadly.</p>
               <p>"Shake not your head at me, man," said Conrad, "you must go if I send a file of
                  men with you."</p>
               <p>"Nay, friend," said Am Rhyn, "it shall not need that. All places are alike to me.
                  It were as well to end this miserable being among the Bohemian crags, as
                  elsewhere. Be it as you will."</p>
               <p>So in the morning they set out together for Waldspurg. On the way Conrad had done
                  his best to infuse some of his own happy spirit into his unfortunate friend; but
                  the latter rode by his side, gloomy and depressed. The knight, after putting
                  Clemens in full possession of the Castle and its domains, stayed but a single
                  night and then departed.</p>
               <p>"Let me see your face bright as of old when I come back," were his last words to
                  Clemens.</p>
               <p>"There is no brightness of face from, a soul helplessly dark as mine," was the
                  gloomy reply.</p>
               <p>Then the Ritter and his train galloped off; and the ex-Reformer stood alone, more
                  depressed than ever, by the absence of Conrad.</p>
               <p>Berg Waldspurg was a large old fourteenth century affair, with the usual fosse and
                  drawbridge, towers and keep. There was also a small chapel, served when the Castle
                  was full of guests, from a monastery of Franciscans a few miles off. The country
                  in the rear was of the wildest description: a gloomy forest clothed the sides of a
                  broken range of mountains; and among these, flowed and foamed the Dresser, a vast
                  torrent which pelted its way among jagged crags and treacherous precipices to the
                  lowlands, where it united with the Iser and flowed into the Elbe.</p>
               <p>Among these wild and savage rocks and fast-<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000097"/> nesses, the wretched Am Rhyn wandered all day;
                  sinking hourly, as it were, into deeper and blacker despair. An occasional
                  encounter with a wolf or boar aroused him into momentary excitement, but he seemed
                  to bear a charmed life, as those who are weary of existence usually do.</p>
               <p>And thus the months rolled on until the beginning of the winter, when the lord of
                  the domain arrived with a gay party of hunters from the Capital. To please his
                  friend, Clemens struggled to awaken from his death lethargy, but in vain; every
                  attempt at gaiety only plunged him back deeper into gloom. Conrad remonstrated and
                  argued with him, merrily, angrily, religiously; but it was useless. He had joined
                  them often in the chase, but never yet at the banquet which followed it, and now
                  the Ritter determined to insist on his presence there also.</p>
               <p>Nor must it be supposed, in employing these human means which seemed to him
                  wisest, that von Landesauer neglected better and higher ones. The daily Mass in
                  the chapel was said for Am Rhyn; and his friend had besought the prayers of all
                  his friends and fervently uttered his own for the darkened soul. Now, seeing
                  Clemens about to set out for his afternoon ramble, he exacted a promise that he
                  would attend the banquet in the evening.</p>
               <p>"You should not go unarmed among the hills there," he said kindly.</p>
               <p>Am Rhyn shewed his boar spear.</p>
               <p>"That is all well in its way," said the stout hunter, "but you should have a good
                  wood-knife at your belt besides. I would not have you devoured by wolves like the
                  child in the nurse's legend. But I see you weary of me. Away with you! and be back
                  for the night meal, as you have promised."</p>
               <p>Am Rhyn saluted his friend and set off for the mountains. There he wandered about,
                  objectless, dull and heavy. At length he noticed that the day was near its close
                  and recollected his promise. He chose his course by the sun and started on his way
                  homeward. But he had gone a long way from the Castle, and the sky was crimson with
                  sunset before he recognized any of the passes as being even in the neighborhood of
                  Waldspurg.</p>
               <p>Then he found himself at a place where he had often rested in his long and gloomy
                  strolls. It was a hunter's road at the foot of a mass of rocks, covered with dwarf
                  cedar and impenetrable juniper copse. The rude road or rather pathway extended in
                  width from these rocks about six or seven feet, and then sloped rather abruptly to
                  the edge of a precipice; and at the foot of that, many, many feet below,<pb
                     n="182-183" xml:id="VAC7182-00000098"/> roared the wild Dresser over its bed of
                  broken rocks.</p>
               <p>As Am Rhyn hastened along, he was arrested by a pair of green burning eyes which
                  flashed on him from in front He saw a huge old wolf, a well known monster, marked
                  by the teeth of many a hound. The severe chase which had been kept up for some
                  weeks by the Ritter, and his party had resulted in the death of all but the oldest
                  and most cunning of these brutes, and these it had deprived of their wonted prey;
                  so that this one stood now glaring at Am Rhyn, gaunt, hollow sided and mad with
                  hunger.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate man saw by the fierce eyes which did not shun his, and by the
                  hungry slaver that dripped from the cruel jaws, that the savage creature was about
                  to attack him. Then he remembered the recommendation of Conrad to take a knife. He
                  had nothing but the short boar spear, on which the straight rushing charge of the
                  wild boar is received, which is steadied by the knee of the kneeling hunter, and
                  only requires to be directed below the shoulder. But the wolf does not charge; it
                  leaps upon the hunter, snaps and springs away, so that a blow must be given by the
                  weapon.</p>
               <p>This Am Rhyn endeavored to do, and. as the brute sprang open-jawed upon him, he
                  smote at its heart with all his force. But the weapon struck outside of the
                  shoulder and though it pierced the hide, and ran in between that and the ribs, it
                  touched no mortal part. But the pain saved Am Rhyn's neck from the fierce snapping
                  jaws, and ere the brute could snap again, he had grasped it by the throat. Then
                  his foot slipped and both fell and rolled down the slope. For one second only,
                  there was a terrific struggle on the brink, and then man and brute fell together
                  over the brow of the cliff.</p>
               <p>More than an hour passed by before Am Rhyn recovered his senses, and then it was
                  in pitchy darkness that he knew himself to be alive. At first he fancied himself
                  in the mines and that he felt the pain of his wounds. He strove to move his right
                  arm, it was broken; he tried to rise without it, his right leg had snapped below
                  the knee; he stretched out his left arm and his fingers touched the edge of the
                  cliff, and from a hundred feet below came up the roar of the torrent; he strained
                  his eyes into the darkness, but it was rayless and absolute; and then close beside
                  him rose a long, agonized, hollow howl that made his heart stand still and the
                  blood curdle in his veins.</p>
               <p>Then he began to guess at his situation. That he and the wolf had fallen upon a
                  ledge of rock, and that on his left hand was the sheer precipice.<pb n="184-185"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000099"/> How large the space was whereon, he lay he knew
                  not, nor in what condition the wolf was. But he knew that he lay there perfectly
                  helpless, in Egyptian gloom, and that he would probably be devoured alive, when
                  longer hunger should give fresh ferocity to the monster beside him. Devoured! not
                  with his blood heated and in the excitement of a struggle for life, but slowly,
                  piecemeal as he lay there powerless even to strike a blow.</p>
               <p>Meantime he recognised the profoundly of the darkness; it was so absolute that it
                  seemed to press upon him with physical weight, and its horror thrilled through his
                  soul. He began to think whether he believed anything, hoped anything, feared
                  anything, but he discovered nothing but a blank, except the fear of death from the
                  jaws of the monster near him.</p>
               <p>He recalled his career with Muenzer; how he had led on the poor peasants, by
                  pretended revelations, the fruits of his wilfully and madly excited brain, and
                  which he knew were all false and baseless; how he had led them to pillage and
                  incendiary violence; how he led them like sheep to the slaughter house of
                  Frankenhausen. But why had he done it? What had he believed, hoped, loved, that
                  made him do it? The guilt was plain enough, but there was no answer to the
                  question of "<emph>Why?</emph>" The mind to that, remained imperviously dark as
                  the terrible night.</p>
               <p>Was there anything in Zuinglianism, or in Karlstadt's views which, he had forsaken
                  for it, or in Luther's, whom he had left for Karlstadt. Back, back went his memory
                  through that blind maze of errors, growing only dizzier and blinder as it went
                  on.</p>
               <p>"Ah," he moaned, "was there nothing in these? did I never believe, nor hope nor
                  love? Was it always this awful silence and darkness."</p>
               <p>And for only answer the inscrutable blackness clung closer round him, and again
                  the long agonized howl arose and quivered through the gloom.</p>
               <p>Back! back! out from this terror, back closer to the outset of life. Through the
                  campaigning time and his gay soldier comrades; through his merry college days.
                  Beyond those! beyond those! to his childhood. Ah.! as he lies there on the brink
                  of death, what is it that he sees? White, white with pain and sorrow, it is his
                  mother's face; frightfully white it shows, framed in the palpable darkness. He
                  knows it at once although he never saw that look upon it in life. Then he
                  recognises that the anguish and pain are for him. A ray breaks in upon his soul;
                  the outline of an image, a Lady crowned with<pb n="186-187"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000100"/> stars, makes itself dimly visible, and the pallid
                  mother-face turns imploringly and lovingly to that and then to him.</p>
               <p>"More light, God!" he gasps, and his prayer is heard. His childhood conies back
                  with its tenderness and its prayer. Snatches as of an old litany break in upon his
                  memory; all his dear love for his mother, his child belief in her beautiful
                  religion, his child hope of a never-fading heaven with her at the feet of Mary and
                  Her Son, rush back upon is soul, and as the hot tears, the first in long, long
                  years, burst from his eyes, he cries from his inmost heart,</p>
               <p>"Stella Matutina! Ora pro me!"</p>
               <p>The vision grew dim, and his eyes followed it as it faded out, out into the night.
                  Then he saw that the blackness of darkness was changed to grey: and every moment
                  that grey grew lighter in its tint, then it broke away on high, and through the
                  rifts peered the deep, stainless blue, and as the azure broadened there flashed
                  from its heart, the diamond lustre of a star. And as the glory quivered earthward,
                  the gloomy mass was broken up in clouds, and a swift breeze swept them away, until
                  the ether was stainless as the soul of a new christened child, and in the deeps of
                  its purity the star shone steadfast and beautiful and serene.</p>
               <p>It was the Star of the Morning.</p>
               <p>He turned his head painfully and saw the wolf. Its back had been broken and it was
                  paralyzed. As it met his eyes the lips were drawn back in a snarl, and it opened
                  its cavernous jaws as if to howl, but their escaped only a long, hissing gasp;
                  then the savage head fell, and the gaunt form shuddered and stiffened out and lay
                  there ugly and dead.</p>
               <p>The heart of Am Rhyn melted into prayer; and his soul swam in an ecstasy of
                  gratitude and penitence. From this he was recalled by a shout He summoned his
                  strength to reply, and his feeble call was echoed by a dozen voices. A moment more
                  and from the cliff above him he saw the face of Conrad von Landesauer.</p>
               <p>The peasants of that neighborhood were skillful cragsmen, and he was soon taken
                  from his dreadful couch. He was borne in a rude litter to the castle, and there
                  God's mercy, through the ministry of the Franciscans, soon restored both soul and
                  body to health</p>
               <p>He followed is friend to the Court of Charles the Fifth and served that Emperor
                  well and long. When Charles retired to his monastery at Yuste, Clemens Am Rhyn
                  retreated to the neighborhood of Waldspurg, and there on the banks of the Iser
                  with the wealth he had gained, he built and endowed for<pb n="188-189"
                     xml:id="VAC7182-00000101"/> the children of Saint Francis the Church and the
                  Convent of<foreign xml:lang="LAT">Maria, Stella Matutina.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>Then entering as a lay brother into that order, his name disappeared from the
                  memory of men, to be written with more loving clearness in God's Book of Life on
                  high.</p>
