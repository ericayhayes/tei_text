Mess to one step she was certain she knew.&#xD;
It had the cadence, although an uncertain&#xD;
one, of Frank's foot. It stumbled up tothe&#xD;
door ; the knock was heard, and she-crept&#xD;
softly up-stairs to light him in and to assist&#xD;
4 him down stairs.&#xD;
4 He reeled into the kitchen, and flungbim-&#xD;
self,"with sullen visage, into a chair; his&#xD;
dress was-disordered, and his features were&#xD;
heavy and Inflamed, while the eyes were full&#xD;
of blood'; and as the mother gazed in silence&#xD;
upon him, she wrung her hands with at any&#xD;
gnish'sopoignant, that it appeared' as if she&#xD;
would have knelt at his feet and there, with&#xD;
a heart all splitting, have died!&#xD;
That same night Frank had been the life&#xD;

and laugh were loudest of all,-every fae&#xD;

dead; his'whole electric fire had gone out;&#xD;
he was utterly collapsed, with ndithet soul&#xD;
nor thought, apd his brain had no further&#xD;
coining. No word was spoken, but his&#xD;
mother gazed furtively upon him as she&#xD;
pressed the little s':pper close to him, and&#xD;
looked in blank silence upon the fearful&#xD;
wreck of her only child.&#xD;
While he was'eating it, ahd'by tarts fall-&#xD;

muttered, as he atteuiped to gaze straight&#xD;
before him. "Very I strange very.strange I"&#xD;
and so, with such disjointed fragments, he&#xD;
reached his mother's door..&#xD;
He knocked softly--there was a light&#xD;
flickering through the kitchen shutters,-he&#xD;
knocked again : the cold was dreadful, and&#xD;
he was ,impatient to get in, but no one&#xD;
came. "It was singular," he thought.&#xD;
"She must have fallen asleep :" and there&#xD;
pealed " three" in the morning from the&#xD;
gray steeple.&#xD;
He stooped down, and' touched the win-&#xD;
4dy-shutter without-it was unfastened-&#xD;
he drew it back, and opening the window,&#xD;
got in and reclosed it, and then with a thrill&#xD;
gf fear lhp began tolook round him.&#xD;
The light was on the table, and the sup.&#xD;
per was laid :as:usual,' but the ire was out&#xD;
and his mother sat in; an old chair. She&#xD;
slept very soundly,, for she moved not-&#xD;
stirred not.;&#xD;
'Hle did not go near her, but stood gazing&#xD;
upon her., x Hewas almost sobered by an in-&#xD;
definable aawe-a cold fear that crept oler&#xD;
him: she looked 'so venerable as ,she sat-&#xD;
for the wrinkled featureswere smoothed into&#xD;
a solemn calm,; The eyes werp closed and&#xD;
the head slightly beat. A strsgglin lock or&#xD;

cupboard ; every dish was empty, every&#xD;
plate cleared. There, was' no bread-no&#xD;
food of any kind but his supper on, the ta-&#xD;

lived.?  For the first time he gave it a&#xD;
thought, and his heart seemed crushed with&#xD;
a weight he could not endure: he gasped&#xD;
for breath;.hle panted-phantoma passed&#xD;
before his eyes ; first all smiling ; at last, all&#xD;
grinning hideouslyI     ,&#xD;
Her head, as we have said, was bent ; but&#xD;
in her bands he detected an object that had&#xD;
missed his gaze. He approached, in order&#xD;
to look upon it nearer,--it was a little lock&#xD;
of golden hair ; his own! A tear had frozen&#xD;
on her cheeks ; she was cold-for he touched&#xD;
her hand ; she was calm ; very calm-she&#xD;
was dead ! Cold, and hunger, and weari-&#xD;
ness of life, togetherwith abandonment of&#xD;
all hope, had done their work!I&#xD;
He may cry ifTbe will, unavailingly, out&#xD;
of his great anguish as the poet did:-&#xD;
' Oh I that those isp, tiad language."&#xD;
But. they were closed for ever, never more&#xD;
to speak to him  with endearing. words-&#xD;
never to pray and to beseech him to beware&#xD;
of the witcheries of drunkenness ; never to&#xD;
kiss his own white lips and ashy cheeks t&#xD;
never to move more.&#xD;
Two or three years went by. and Frani&#xD;
Wildeyg, who now lived with his wife in a&#xD;
wretched room, had only sank lower and&#xD;
lower in the scale of society. For a long&#xD;
time the father'of his wife had refused to&#xD;
take hyp4 of either of them. The wrathfal&#xD;
man had driven poor Frances forth, and&#xD;
cursed ler for her clandestine marriage ;&#xD;
but softened by her sorrow and distress,he&#xD;
had at lest relented so:far as to give her a&#xD;
trifle of money now and then, which, with'&#xD;
th needlework she had obtained, helped to&#xD;

"Wiat do you mean ?" demanded he, in&#xD;
a: ferce tone ; "and what do they. say."&#xD;
"They say, Frank," replied -the wife in&#xD;
a tone.of mournful sadness, " that by your&#xD;

The dismayed husband put his hand to&#xD;

and dreadful night came. before him with&#xD;
every hideous particular,;. and while his&#xD;
conscience told him that. the fearful accusa-&#xD;

that ;he should be taunted with it, then&#xD;
starting up with flaming eyes and clenched&#xD;

" I do, by heaven I" said he, Ieliberately,&#xD;
as herose up and walked to thesmall chest&#xD;
of drawers against ,the wall, and opening&#xD;
them, he tossed out, one. by one, the sad&#xD;
remains of the finery, she wore in her girl-&#xD;

scalded her, did..shes see, dung out, ,the&#xD;

wedding dress, " this is of ne other use.-&#xD;
Pawn it.".&#xD;
" Pawp it I you cannot meotn I, Frank,&#xD;
do not, for heaven's sake !- do not I" but&#xD;
she spoke to one deaf as aanadder. Sh9&#xD;
spoke to one whose, heart was callous and&#xD;
barpened ; she spoke to one who now&#xD;
found a fiendish pleasure ,in pursuing his&#xD;
point; for he saw thatit was gnawing her&#xD;
to the very heart,.&#xD;
"A    d here's a shawl,?' said h, contempt&#xD;

He paused a moment,-and then with -bit-&#xD;
ter hardihood, said:&#xD;
"You, my-dear, can apply at the work-&#xD;
house; and for the child-i-whv she will be a&#xD;
lady of property when she is of age, or you,&#xD;
Can send her to her guardian's, or apply to&#xD;

She'did not wait the completion of the&#xD;

descend. She spoke no word-=murmured&#xD;
&#xD;
no longer--the bundle was made up.&#xD;
- "Now," said he, "place it under your&#xD;

Putting on her' miserable bonnet and'her&#xD;
little'scanty shawl, with a heart sick to&#xD;
death, and with a face all pale and ghastly,&#xD;
she descended the stairs, while Frank fol-&#xD;
lowed, 'dragging, rather than leading his&#xD;
child by the hand.&#xD;
S'Out of one of the leading and crowded&#xD;
thoroughfards there stood a court, and at&#xD;
the corner of this part was a small door,&#xD;
which was so formed 1 as to elude public ob-&#xD;
ervation;-while Â°at:the same tine is was well&#xD;
known that this was the entrance into the&#xD;
patvnbroker's shop.&#xD;

but even while a glow 'of satisfaction at the&#xD;

him, wdlmsand vague misgiving-of advane-&#xD;
lag knischief. If he bya premature cruelty&#xD;
maimed his right hand-Ahat'is tosay, If he&#xD;
deprived his wife of all chance or hope-it&#xD;
would'teavei him breadless and pennies ;&#xD;

He started ; but as be got into the pas,&#xD;

butliike Mudge. A glance of' mutual r-&#xD;
cognition ensued ; but Mudge evidently did&#xD;
not wish td drawiupon him the wife's as-&#xD;
tention.&#xD;
Prahk planed a few shillings " into her&#xD;
hand, and pushing the child roughly to her,&#xD;
bade her to go home ; and then darting&#xD;
round the coxner was soon seated with his&#xD;
friend in deep and earnest conversation in&#xD;
the private parlor of a low tavern.&#xD;

SEATED in the tavern, Mudge at lat 1(.&#xD;
ed up his heavy brows, and cast a keen, sa-&#xD;
gacious look On the haggard face eind tfis&#xD;

up his voice he tried in a atoneying tone.&#xD;
" Wot, Frank, and is this rely you ?"&#xD;
" What do you mean by asking that?"&#xD;
demanded Frank, somewhat angrily.&#xD;
" Why, I was' a-thinkin' to myself," are-&#xD;
plied Midge, with an assumed air of medit-&#xD;
tation, "can -thin be the dashing young&#xD;

to request it to be particular to a minute.&#xD;

ture consideration, we are greatly more&#xD;
inclined to admire this swart and happy&#xD;
artizan than Frank Wildeye indthe gayest&#xD;

Undoubtedly Frank Wildeye, as. he&#xD;

tinued his "half-quartern,'" hadvvery direr-&#xD;
eut ideas to these which are passing through&#xD;

thing very awful ? Does i iot calm' you&#xD;

that, d6 you see, pyreader, is still nore&#xD;
awful. There lies the prine, of boon conn&#xD;

cold.&#xD;
stark are the limbs, end clammy are tie&#xD;
hands  theoth and the obscene 'jds are&#xD;
silent fpr ever.,  he lips are'thin blue and&#xD;
ghastly, and the cheeks lead like and hor-&#xD;
rible. There is a gathering of frowns, on&#xD;
the bro  that shake9one, to look upon, ap&#xD;
if he h' 4ied with gnashing of teeth'&#xD;
and a f rehead covered with the sweat 6f&#xD;

'Why is. it, oh, draiakards ! that when ye  "'- hat'sanother," replied Mike. "Wots&#xD;
are compelled to listen and to tLink-why, the use of telling me such a twister as that?&#xD;
I say, is it that the words 'death," "to die," Sometimes, if I believe the contrary of wot&#xD;
"to be buried," and "the judggnent after you say, Iget hold of the truth. Why, you'd&#xD;

and the thought will come. Why have they  Frank withont-any attempt at justifica-&#xD;

It was some such thought that must'have "I say," he began, "you've been and'&#xD;
passed'through the mind of Frank Wildeye, pitched into them at home, I find; you're a&#xD;
as' a funeral crossed his path, and drove him shocking brute ?"&#xD;
instantly into the next tavern bar, where he  Frank, with a rolay of oaths, asked "how&#xD;

" and can'itbe done ?"&#xD;
" No," answered Frank : ita fastened&#xD;
every way, and I may starve, while they--"&#xD;
and, here he broke out into bitter curses&#xD;
against the dead.&#xD;
"Ihave told, you half a dozen times,"&#xD;
said Mudge," that you're not worth a crust'&#xD;
to- keep you from starving,-do you hear&#xD;
that, now? I'U tell you what-if money&#xD;
could have been 'raised, I'd have helped&#xD;
you with the dodge ; but as it can't, i and&#xD;
Isnspeeted, itso, I have arranged the busi-&#xD;

Frank, stared at him with a stupified. air.&#xD;
Mudge continued : " I went to your house&#xD;
some time back, and I saw what, you had&#xD;
done: and. if you'd beenin the room, 1'&#xD;
don't know,"continued the brawny ruffian,&#xD;
looking at his hand and bony wrists, "but&#xD;
Id have thrown youdown the stairs, orout'&#xD;

"'Would you, though ?" muttered Frank,&#xD;
rebelliously, and somewhat valiantly, for&#xD;
thy contenptuous manner of. this strange&#xD;
being was beginning, to grow unbearable.&#xD;
" We should have aeen about that."&#xD;
" Very true, so we would," assented&#xD;
Mike. "Well, I lifted up the woman,- and&#xD;

" you don't care much about her, do&#xD;

"No. Care l.no," cried Frank.&#xD;

" Then how could''you, se  her eyes?"&#xD;

"There, that'll do,"' said Budge,;in a&#xD;
tone and With a manner of evident:disgust,&#xD;
as much as to-imply, "The more questions&#xD;

only added, " Say":no more about it. -"If&#xD;

In a littleden beside.tri door, a powerful&#xD;
looking man, with a .lack and sinister as-&#xD;
p'eet of acgntenance, was .eated, as guar-&#xD;
dian of the placeqasting a iqok of cor&#xD;

" Right," laconically,replied the robber,&#xD;
and then began0toascendthewide staircase.&#xD;
One. landing iafty the ether was passed,&#xD;
until Frank, ..wearied with the journey,&#xD;
asked "if they had not already gone&#xD;
through the rogf,,and were, getting into the&#xD;
clouds ?" to which Mudge made noanswer ;&#xD;
but steadily con inued to. ascend, until he&#xD;
stopped at a door on the highest landing,&#xD;
which he opened by a spring   and when&#xD;
both were in, he closed it safely after&#xD;

A second and a match sufficed to light a&#xD;
candle stuck into a bottle, and Frank with&#xD;
no little curiosity began to look about him.&#xD;
By the shelving roof, and The trap at the&#xD;
top attainable'from the old table, the man&#xD;
found they were in a largd attie. In one&#xD;
corner was a' rude pallet and a chair or&#xD;

and some culinary utensils concluded the&#xD;
furniture of the chamber.' 'Mudge immedib&#xD;
ately bdgau to'place food and drink on the&#xD;

and :now as you've set up in business, you'll&#xD;
be forced to do the samie, or elseshare&#xD;
mine." '&#xD;
'" Ah t well,' we shall see about that,"&#xD;
replied Frank, tiieaily; for he did not&#xD;
like the alltsidt to'"business," and wished&#xD;
to drive it from his'reniembr-nce as far as&#xD;
he could. Once more, therefore, he applied&#xD;
to the spirits, of which he drank copiously.&#xD;
"Now,"   aid- Mudge, when' their meal&#xD;
was over, "let's have a look at the plunder."&#xD;
He then took several'articles' out of -his&#xD;
pocket and 'paced Them dri' the' table.-&#xD;
There was a valuable gold watch,' a dka&#xD;
mond bracelet, se'eral'articles o'f jevellery,&#xD;
and gold and 'Banknotes to a oerisiderable&#xD;
amount.   "There's 'a  hundred 'a-piece&#xD;
here," inutteredl Mudge, "'if there's' a&#xD;
penny.'&#xD;
Frank's eyes lighted up with eupidity-&#xD;
all dangers, past and future were forgotten.&#xD;
He stretched outhis lian1 to  elras hie por-&#xD;
tion, when Mike coolly jlanc ng at him,&#xD;
eatd,-"You must wait 'a bit, my boy-we&#xD;
must smnash those'screens first :" healingg&#xD;
that the Bank notes must be exchanged'for-&#xD;
gold.&#xD;
We can doltat, in the morning ,at any&#xD;
of the shops," observed Frank, 'beginning&#xD;
to be alarmed lest 'this should be a plan for&#xD;
cheating hm of his portion.&#xD;
" What afool you are," retorted. Mike.-&#xD;
"If you take one of the flimsies to get&#xD;
change to-morrow, you'd get it at the 01si&#xD;
Bailey or Newgate in, an hour after. Why,&#xD;
these ntimbrg -will be all over town he-&#xD;

on the ruffian's face, however, Frank saw&#xD;
that something was wrong.        ;&#xD;
"'What'ethe matter now?' asked he..&#xD;
"Matter.l,' echoed Mike, with a volley&#xD;
of deep and bitter curses.- " Why,, there's&#xD;
that old scoundral of a fiend.robs me, that&#xD;
all.- This is the sort of game,' my boy,"&#xD;
add ted Mike, savagely.  ' We -are com.&#xD;

orde to ,do the same thing, 9r ,else theses&#xD;

that the notes amounting :to nearly., one&#xD;

,would be. better-r;-it would be better !",this&#xD;

" What's the matter now. Edward?" asked,&#xD;
hit father, starting up : " I suppose its some&#xD;
.piece of mischief you're up to again. Go&#xD;
and sit down by your mamma, you rogue,&#xD;
and let me have'my nap."  .&#xD;
" But really, papa, there is some one&#xD;
waiting for you." It was then that a nun-&#xD;
her of the men happening to be released&#xD;
from labor, suddenly stopped, arrested by&#xD;
the sight of a handsome carriage without&#xD;
the great gate ; but the lowers and 'shrubs&#xD;
about the spot where Andrew sat, prevented&#xD;
him from seeing it.&#xD;
A footman in an elegant livery made his&#xD;
appearance, bearing a portfolio under his&#xD;
arm, and a small case in his hand.. Taking&#xD;
's ealed paper out Of his portfolio, he handed&#xD;
it after an inquiry' with a low bow to An-,&#xD;
drew, together with the case,'which, upon&#xD;
opening, AndrEw found to contain a medal.,&#xD;
-this le gave 'to his wife for inspection,&#xD;
and' proceeded to read the papers.&#xD;
Certainly it must have been a very strange&#xD;
paper that, for It made the, breast of the'&#xD;
brave man pint and heave, and his eyes to;&#xD;
sparkle with a sudden joy. A trembling of&#xD;
the limbs seized him for an instant, and then&#xD;
the workmen without, having heard some-&#xD;
thing of the business which brought the&#xD;
messenger there, gave three hearty cheers&#xD;
to Edward Douglass, while the poor father,&#xD;
to the boy's astonishment, clasped him to&#xD;
his bosom.&#xD;
STEP V[.&#xD;
fAPPIEs&#xD;
MaS. Douglass, or Clara, as we shall con-'&#xD;
tinue tb eall her, was astonished. "What&#xD;
isalt this about, Andrew!" asked she ;&#xD;
"and why do the men-cheer :fbr Edward,&#xD;
'nd group without there at, the gate? iand&#xD;
what is this elegant medallian for? speak&#xD;
I am all anxiety."&#xD;
&#xD;
L .&#xD;
&#xD;
But Andrew was enmbracing his son.: ' I&#xD;
gave heaven .thanks when you were born,&#xD;
Edward," said he, and I thank heaven&#xD;
anew asif you were born to me again: This,&#xD;
my dear wife," continued AndreW, turning&#xD;
to her, and mastering his emotion, "'is' a&#xD;
letter from'the Royal Huniane'Soeiety$ dc-&#xD;
'cothpaniied with their medal; to my-u-to-ohr&#xD;
son Edward, for saving' the lives of two&#xD;
littleboys while' they were bathing.- lie&#xD;
was standing on the 'bank, and he- heard&#xD;
their cry, and - dressed as he was, Without&#xD;
calculating the danger tohimself,he plunged&#xD;
into the water, and by great exertion saved&#xD;
them. -This-is a testimony to his courage&#xD;
and bravery, which I prize mor:than all&#xD;
the military medals in the word, 'though,"&#xD;
he added, smiling. " my old uncle would&#xD;
not have thought so."&#xD;
Edward stood beside him, his cheeks suf-&#xD;
fused with a blush of joy ancl modesty.--&#xD;
Some of the older and more privileged men&#xD;
had come into the arbour, and Bshaking him&#xD;
by the hand, congratulated, him on his&#xD;
bravery; then the handsome medal was&#xD;
passed round aming them and'greatly ad-&#xD;
mired.&#xD;
In the meantime th footman ba departed&#xD;
with the carriage, for Io other visitors were&#xD;
within it, and the mother  still enaeavor-&#xD;

dimly, for her eyee were all  eat-s of joy ;&#xD;
and when the young boT at lit came and&#xD;

might be as much as possible alleviated ;&#xD;
and it |was hoped - that, with the coming&#xD;

to brighten 'up.&#xD;
But there:also happened in conjunction to&#xD;
the frightful paralysis of trade, one of those&#xD;
strange and inexplicable events which, upon&#xD;
a scale vast and gigantic, appear to be- the&#xD;
ravages of some supernatural being rather&#xD;
than the result of accident: In the exten-&#xD;
sive village -of D-'--, situated in the&#xD;
most central part of the west of England,&#xD;
where foundries, fdetories, and cloth-mills&#xD;
were established and thousands of opera-&#xD;
tives dwelt, a great and terrible fire took&#xD;
place,which-almostannihilated the property&#xD;
on the spot, And by means of 'which many&#xD;
lives ware lost.&#xD;
This'again called upon the sympathies of&#xD;
men, and the nanie of Andrew Douglass&#xD;
was amongst-the first of those who advanced&#xD;
to their relief. -The property was insured&#xD;
to -almost its full amount jn the variousoffi-&#xD;
ces-; 'bdt the people,--tbe' artizan,  the&#xD;
weaver,' and the mechanic-had lost their&#xD;
all,-.-their, in some eases, costly tools, their&#xD;
furniture, and their clothing.' It was in&#xD;
their favor that public sympathy    was&#xD;
aroused and turned, and Andrew Douglass,&#xD;
id order that he should not go half-way in&#xD;
the noble work of benevolene' which now&#xD;
prompted him, determined to visit the spot&#xD;
himself.&#xD;
Andrew Douglass was now, fifty'years of&#xD;
age. Half a'century had rolled over his&#xD;
head, and while he journeyed oa the coach,&#xD;
as it proceeded. from 'London to D-.----,&#xD;
his thoughts were many and strange. . The&#xD;
World hadgone well with him; but he had&#xD;
looked back upon nearly thirty years of&#xD;
hard, manual labor, which had loomed be-&#xD;
fore him like the, migbtj Alps. He had&#xD;
then neverdreamt of being the Hannibal&#xD;
that should dross them. Never-did the idea&#xD;
of mastery, of ifluence of wealth, of power,&#xD;

CIIAPTER .L.t&#xD;
LOOSE UPON TOWN.&#xD;
IT was oaa dull November day, when the&#xD;
atmosphere of London was as, thick, as&#xD;
drisaly, as smelly,,and as disagreeable as&#xD;
it ,uld weli be! and everything felt as cold&#xD;
end Blam my to tie touch, that a well-grown&#xD;
yout i of about seventeen years of age,'was&#xD;
seated in a small coffee-house,situated in-one&#xD;
of the numerous courtsntu ping out of Fleet&#xD;
Street.&#xD;
His coat which- had once been handsome&#xD;
and well-cut, was now grown rusty and&#xD;
threadbare ; his hat was seedy, his boots&#xD;
soiled, and out at the toes ; his linen of a&#xD;
yellowish tinge, had shrunk under his worn&#xD;
cravat ; in fact, he had an air of faded gen-&#xD;
tility which as plainly as possible spoke&#xD;
that he had fallen under the frowns of for-&#xD;
tune, and that he was in the "sere and yel-&#xD;
low leaf " of his luck,-in other words, he&#xD;
wasa homeless-parentless-friendless vag-&#xD;
abond.&#xD;
His pale face was certainly handsome;&#xD;
but there was also in his jaded air that pe-&#xD;
culiar expression resulting from dissipation&#xD;
and precocious excesses. His melancholy&#xD;
and downcast eyes told that his heart wose&#xD;
sunken and heavy.&#xD;
" Well, Jack Hazard," he muttered,&#xD;
apostrophislng himself, as he jingled over&#xD;
the few halfpence in 'his pocket, "1you are&#xD;
Ina nice condition now, I hope. What do&#xD;
you-propose to do next? My father," he s&#xD;
&#xD;
continued, changing the grammatical form&#xD;
of his colloquy, " made a nice mess of it,&#xD;
when he began at the tavern, and swore that&#xD;
I'had the sweetest voice of all the boys be-&#xD;
longing to St. Paul's choir ; and when my&#xD;
mother-heaven- rest her, and forgive my&#xD;
share in her death I" he added with' some&#xD;
emotion, "used to send me to  fetch, him&#xD;
home, he' would make mesdrink; and sing&#xD;
to hiW drunken comradeS, till I was as tipsy&#xD;
as-himself.  What between that youthful&#xD;
dissipation and card-playing, I am in a&#xD;
pretty considerable fix, as the Yankees say.&#xD;
Then he must needs go and win a lot of&#xD;
money at a Derby sweep, and that did the&#xD;
business. In three weeks he died raving&#xD;
mad, and mother soon followed. The little&#xD;
money he left me, found its way into the&#xD;
pockets of tavern-keepersand billiard-room&#xD;
sharps ; for I must go and bet like other&#xD;
fools on races; and try my luck in twenty&#xD;
or thirty sweeps,-and, as a matter of&#xD;
course, be fleeced of all. What's to be&#xD;
done ?" and he threw himself back in his&#xD;
seat with an air of perplexity.&#xD;
" I'll tell you, sir, if you'll permit me,"&#xD;
responded a voice almost over his shoulder.&#xD;
Hazard started-and looked up, and met the&#xD;
glance of akeen, restless pair of eyes, where&#xD;
cunning and a sort of malicious sarcastico&#xD;
klnd of humor lurked.&#xD;
This individual was a Jeremy Diddler&#xD;
sort of man, but upon a highly respectable&#xD;
scale. The face was thin and sallow, the&#xD;

- ' No doubt. of it, count," replied Jack&#xD;
quickly, beginning at the same time to be&#xD;
interested; in, the promises of this indi-&#xD;
vidual who'was so liberal, in his profes-&#xD;
sions. , .                 -&#xD;
" What expectations have you ?" pursued&#xD;
Count de la Roos:&#xD;
" That of starving, for aught I know,"&#xD;
was:the answer ; " for my father, who;was&#xD;
in business as a carpenter, knocked it up&#xD;
before Ihada chance of being able to do a&#xD;
day's work."&#xD;
"Sppsible man I" said the count.  "I&#xD;
admire him. . Work! workis plebeian"-&#xD;
and he curled his lips in disdain: " the vo-j&#xD;
taries of fortune never work. Will you join&#xD;
with. me?"&#xD;
"In what?" asked Jack, while stirring up&#xD;
the remains of his cold coffee.&#xD;
" Keen- keen, air, I perceive," remarked&#xD;
the count. "I'll tell you :-in a dinner, a&#xD;
bottle of fine gin, a lodging, and so forth ;&#xD;
but, above all, in a spec--a spec, sir."&#xD;
"I will join you willingly," was the re-&#xD;
ply," as all the former are very welcome&#xD;
to'tne'; and in the'ist one also, if it can&#xD;
be made serviceable to either you or my-&#xD;
self." 4&#xD;
"Not a doubt of it. Here, waiter" two&#xD;
cups'of"coffee." The order was'obeyed ;&#xD;
and when the attendant -was gone, Count&#xD;
Addlphe" resumed : " I .was asking you'&#xD;
what your expectations were-that is,&#xD;
whetber'yot have'any friends or relations&#xD;
+' The former have discarded -me," said&#xD;
Jack,.a little:mournfully ; " but they were&#xD;
poor ; and," added he ungratefully,f ' they&#xD;
were no great loss. I have some relay&#xD;
tions,, I believe, but I know little about&#xD;
thpta.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Rich?"demanded De Ia0oos, Iaoni*&#xD;
cally..&#xD;
" bave heard that one, of them is so,&#xD;
but I do not know who or what he is."&#xD;
"fWe'llfind him out," said the count,&#xD;
brightening up. and added in a very deci-&#xD;
ded tone, "we'll discover him, sir, and&#xD;
give you to his fond, arms as a, long-lost&#xD;
and, affectionate relative. Now finish up&#xD;
that mahogany decoction, and let us be&#xD;
going. I have a few things to say to you&#xD;
in private." Jack did as he was desired,&#xD;
and they quitted the place..&#xD;
The evening found them   seated' in a&#xD;
convenient attic which the count was wont&#xD;
to hire as 'his summer residence-the house&#xD;
being situated in that airy department of&#xD;
this modern Babylon, denominated 'Clerk-&#xD;
enwelL-&#xD;
The fashion of the West End, so far as&#xD;
the furniture was concerned, was more&#xD;
strictly followed, In "the breach" rather&#xD;
than in the ' observance." A turn down&#xD;
bedstead was concealed in:a kind of large&#xD;
cabinet with folding doors, bearing impress&#xD;
of the "New Cut" manufacture, an old&#xD;
table, two or three chairs, a few culinary&#xD;
articles, and a great scarcity of crockery,&#xD;
constituted the,. domestic, properties of&#xD;
Adolphe Count de la Roos.&#xD;
He did not, however, waste time In apolo-&#xD;
gizing for the meagreness of his accom-&#xD;
modation ; but he spread the cloth, laid&#xD;
food on the table, placed out the promised&#xD;
liquor, and taking apack' of cards from a&#xD;
recess at ban'd, began the monent the meal&#xD;
was over to initiate Hazard still farther&#xD;
into the mysteries of gaming, which plain-&#xD;
ly exhibited his superiority over the youth,&#xD;
'hatever might 'have been his previous&#xD;
qualifications.'&#xD;
" You play 'all fours,',do you ?" said be,&#xD;
during the conversation Which ensued&#xD;
" very good-it's a low game, but it suits&#xD;
a beginner admirably. The. exercise of&#xD;
'shuging,' 'cutting,' and' turning up,' ,i&#xD;
not to be despised-it gives one dexterity&#xD;
in the manipulation of these truly scientific&#xD;
auxiliaries to a mapof the world; but,&#xD;
&#xD;
you do play ' all fours,' be, a master at it-&#xD;
avoid cribbage-it's only fit for old men an(&#xD;
their wives-not for artists: it requires to&#xD;
much play ; acd you can't manage matter&#xD;
so well."&#xD;
Jack Hazard acknowledged'the correct&#xD;
ness of the count's remarks, and in assent&#xD;
log to them  promised to avail himself o&#xD;
the experience which that worthy lnau&#xD;
must necessarily possess.&#xD;
"Now," continued the count, thought&#xD;
fully, as he caressed his chin, " I can giv&#xD;
you an entire into life ; but is not a very&#xD;
suberb one-yet, that must be managed&#xD;
afterwards, and by~your means--"&#xD;
" Mine I" interrupted Jack, lifting up his&#xD;
eyes in surprise, while a smile of incredu-&#xD;
lity crossed his features: " how- can that&#xD;
be?"&#xD;
"Don't interrupt me," returned the&#xD;
count; "it's done   in exceedingly bad&#xD;
taste, not to :add that it breaks into one's&#xD;
train of thoughts. How much money have&#xD;
you?". and he bent his keen eagle-eye upon&#xD;
Jack.&#xD;
"About sevenpence halfpenny," replied&#xD;
Jack, exhibiting his stock of wealth.&#xD;
" Not much; but 'still better than none,"&#xD;
was the comment of the sharper. "I have&#xD;
known a fortune to be based upon as small&#xD;
a found tion., The mischief of such for-&#xD;
tunes, however, is, that:they grow in the&#xD;
manner (f an inverted pyramid :-theyare&#xD;
not secur t. It is for that reason," added&#xD;
be, philosophically, "I have never sought.&#xD;
to build nine upon a seale of such magni-&#xD;
tude. In moderation there is safety."&#xD;
- All thea while he was shuffling and cut-&#xD;
ting the cards with 'a dexterity and quick-&#xD;
ness-whh'h betrayed one- practised in' that&#xD;
branch of the' useless arts. " Hatn!"; he&#xD;
murur'ed;'"be must have a little more&#xD;

ad ai *34 a erown-piece on the table-&#xD;
&#xD;
- "and yours .shall he considered, if you&#xD;
d: lose, as.a debt of honor. Play."&#xD;
o   The game proceeded., Jack showed,&#xD;
s great ability, and Count. Adolphe compli&#xD;
rented him upon it, at the same time in-&#xD;
terspersing his voluble chatter with, a&#xD;
variety of observation and instruction, all,&#xD;
f pleasantly enough intermingled,' were its&#xD;

hithielf in possession of about a pound, to&#xD;
the evident satisfaction , of , his mentor,&#xD;
whose singularity of .selection did . no;;&#xD;
strike Jack as being of the wisest ; but he,&#xD;
was yet to learn that a rman lile the count;&#xD;
did not bestow his philanthropy without p&#xD;
clear object in view.&#xD;
-"Now,",'said Count Adolphe, abruptly,&#xD;
as he rose, 5' it is time for us to go abroad ;&#xD;
and mark me," he added, rather sternly:&#xD;
"the money you have won from mne, must,&#xD;
be trebled -at least,, before we return : so&#xD;
make your toilette, clean your boots, wash,&#xD;
your face, trim. your hair, brush your hat,.&#xD;
put on that clean front"-handing him&#xD;
one,-" and then we shall be prepared."&#xD;
In a few minutes , afterwards the count,&#xD;
was pleased to pass a compliment upon the&#xD;
changed appearance of the young man;,&#xD;
and certainly, with a little trouble and&#xD;
less cost, never- was a more remarkable&#xD;
metamorphosis., Brushes, soap, and water,&#xD;
had done their work well.&#xD;
They went forth.   It required some&#xD;
half-hour to elapse ere they.sgot into the&#xD;
neighborhood of Leicester Square. Has-&#xD;
ard was not such a novice as to expre',&#xD;
any surprise at the number of mustachioed&#xD;
cigarette-smoking individuals who exchange&#xD;
ed salutes with the count.. To any .casual&#xD;
observer, most of these men had a peculiar&#xD;
feature and mannerism that. stamped thea&#xD;
at once as members-of that "industriqta",&#xD;

IN a gorgeously fitted little chamber be-&#xD;
longing t' one of the' most widely-known&#xD;
private' gambling 'establishments, 'of 'the&#xD;
West End, Adolphe 'Cbunt'de la Ross Was&#xD;
seated, cr ekitg filberts, drinking claret,and&#xD;
half-reelining kt his ease, while  Conversing&#xD;
with an 'individual, who, with, his feet oil&#xD;
the fbnder, was coolly cmoking'acigat.&#xD;
We taie described the count,'we must&#xD;
now give some little idea of his companion,&#xD;
who was no other than the huge and burly&#xD;
giant that k-pt the tavern where Jack made&#xD;
his first successful debut.&#xD;
The man stood six feet two, with 'a head&#xD;
and nec  like those 'of a bull. In the&#xD;
thick, sen ual lips, in the nose of Ethiopian&#xD;
forfnation, in the small, half-shut eyes, the&#xD;
seamed a d 'bloated cheeks, you 'traced ait&#xD;
exaggeration of the animal passions, which&#xD;
ir.stihctively made you recoil' with aversion&#xD;
and disgust.- The saytyr-like features were&#xD;
indicative of a depravity' that we dare not&#xD;
trust ourselves toahy'a farther description.&#xD;
The small bitt elegant room' was bril-&#xD;
liantlylighted with gats; the air was warm;&#xD;
the two men weie surrounded with luxuries,&#xD;
and on the table among the bottles lay&#xD;
some'peculiarly formed'implementsof gam-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
So you think you've done the trick, do&#xD;
yon, ount?"' observed the gladiator, in a&#xD;
hoarse, husky voice, inundating the bright&#xD;
bars as he spoke with a sktaration of 'to-&#xD;
bacco juie.       -&#xD;
"I'll tell you'what it is, Digges," returned&#xD;
Adolphe with an indescribable insolence of&#xD;
pOliteness: - "when -you make 'remarks of&#xD;
that:kind, lot it- be don with an expression&#xD;
of more confidence in my skill., Do you&#xD;
think, witliyour bull-head,' add your thick4&#xD;
er brain, that ataa like myself carries as&#xD;
&#xD;
P1ri&#xD;
&#xD;
aspemiultive theory-for months upon the&#xD;
mere chance of being; right or wrong ? I&#xD;
do not think'-I know it to be so."&#xD;
"Well, may 'he you 'do,'I growled the&#xD;
other, "only,.don't be so dignified over it,&#xD;
and be hanged' to yien or I'll'get up and&#xD;
knock you over ;" and, as he struck off the&#xD;
ashes at the end of his cigar, his vice 'died&#xD;
away in his throat like'distant thunder.&#xD;
"Ah 1" exclaimed the count, "you must&#xD;
always let the animal exhibit itself in your&#xD;
nature. I 'don't know what could possibly&#xD;
have made me join issue with a fellow only&#xD;
fit to carry porter'slosds., We shall have&#xD;
you spoil some of, our best designs with&#xD;
your,abominable brutality shortly.""&#xD;
"Come, I say, don 't,-draw it mild,"&#xD;
returned the bther, threateningly..&#xD;
"Douyoti'menu e me, you rascal Y" del&#xD;
manded Adolphe, turning leis wicked glance&#xD;
upon the giant, wbQ seemed to be awed by,&#xD;
its. power., "Do you know that I can trans-&#xD;
port or gibbet you?"&#xD;
"There, that'll do," said Digges, ina&#xD;
gentler tone, like the subdued growl of a&#xD;
tiger,: "I know -you're a, trump.. What's&#xD;
the use of talking this way? You've pick&#xD;
ed up a feller as is well enough in hisway&#xD;
but what's to he #lne'wlth him?"&#xD;
"I'll tell you, if you'll listen," returned&#xD;
the count, blandly, mollified by the sub&#xD;
mission of the huge Oaliban; "because you&#xD;

moodily, and mechanically began his break-&#xD;

After awhile, he turned his eye languidly&#xD;

weaving the somewhat amusing slang of&#xD;
the men who.are accustomed to their trade,&#xD;
with promises of enormous wealth on the&#xD;

down their money with avidity; for there&#xD;
had been a run ofluck against the bank,-&#xD;
and though some cautions winners had de-&#xD;
parted. there remained plenty more to pay&#xD;
up the deficiency with ample interest.&#xD;
Hazard advanced and looked on, He&#xD;
was unmindful of the burly giant of a man&#xD;
who stood most beside him ; he was un-&#xD;
mindful of the wins and nods that were&#xD;
passed around ; he did not remark the keen&#xD;
and rapid glance which the count flung upon&#xD;
him, nor the sarcastic lifting of the eye-lid&#xD;
with which he appeared to accompany that&#xD;
glance:- Hazard.was absorbed in his own&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;

Waiddowahnd died. It was the curse aris-&#xD;
ing from a his want of education, that he&#xD;
knew not.-how to bestow his time. - Books&#xD;
he had in plenty ;round him; but he deriv'&#xD;
4e no pleasure from them. lfictures.he had&#xD;
looked upon as mere auxiliaries to the tur-&#xD;
nishiog of a room.; but further than that&#xD;
they ceased to interest him. Horses he&#xD;
had, and he often used- them, and to some&#xD;
little extent he had created a little acquaia,&#xD;
tanceship among- the small squires, the&#xD;
farmers, jockies, and so on, of t e neigh-&#xD;
borhood ; but even these were of a class&#xD;
that showed him he was not in the circle&#xD;
he wished to be in. There was drinking at&#xD;
the fair, and a game of bowls on the green,&#xD;
and rustic festivities, where, vice in a&#xD;
meauand depraved garb still exercised her&#xD;
rule.&#xD;
If he moved abroad, the hateful form of&#xD;
the giant Digggs,still. crossed his path ; it&#xD;
he stayed at home, the huge animal would&#xD;
force himself upon him; and still laboring&#xD;
pnder the dread of exposure, he allowed&#xD;
himself to be. plundered. At times, too, a&#xD;
short and laconic note from the count, re-&#xD;
minded him of the terrible power he had&#xD;
over him. But he did not demand money;&#xD;
and, further than that Hazard knew him&#xD;
gelf tobe under the eyes of the bruiser, he&#xD;
experienced no  other annoyance from&#xD;
Adolphe de la Roos Jones.&#xD;
In the meantime, with one edess or an-&#xD;
6ter,'he was impairing his' tortune, which&#xD;
he 'too'l'no heed to guard. Having taken&#xD;
Ssad leave of his cousin Laura, udder some&#xD;
retest or another, he went to 'Paris in the&#xD;
ope' af being able to drown his cares and&#xD;
remorse in'the dissipations of the capital.&#xD;
'he gaming-tables' found a"practised man&#xD;
tn be their easiest victim ; for he seemed to&#xD;
quandhre away his gold with ' reckless-&#xD;
less that would have beggared him, had&#xD;
he not been stopped by the following oc-&#xD;
hutrekibe:_&#xD;
He was one night in the Palais Royal,&#xD;
playing with the tame avidity as ever,&#xD;
a , a tall man in a oloak touched him by&#xD;
the arm,tand said:&#xD;
"The count wantayou."         .&#xD;
&#xD;
! PRORES.                       $2&#xD;
He turned and recognized the brutal&#xD;
countenance of his watcher.&#xD;
The terror with which this man Inspired&#xD;
him was now complete. He had established&#xD;
so entire a despotism over Hazard-had&#xD;
exercised it with so much rigor, that. the&#xD;
unhappy youth gave himself up unresist-&#xD;
ingly to it. He began to dread the sound&#xD;
of that heavy foot, the sight of those&#xD;
drunken and bloated features ; in fact, the&#xD;
man had but to will and Hazard to obey.&#xD;
On this occasion, then, with a new linking&#xD;
of the heart, he followed the pugilist to a&#xD;
neighboring apartment, where the only per.&#xD;
son he inet was Adolphe Count de la Roos,&#xD;
in person.&#xD;
" Sob 1 you're quite Parisian In tiste, eh,&#xD;
Mr. Hazard ?" began the count with a smile,&#xD;
"I congratulate you; I have no doubt 'but&#xD;
that you have learned somethinghere.that&#xD;
may be highly advantageous to ds, only I&#xD;
regret that I must recall you back to Eug.&#xD;

" To England 1" echoed Jack.- "Where-&#xD;

"Because, you will' remember that the&#xD;
year of grace I gave you isr nearly up.&#xD;
Miss Copland is also anxious about you,&#xD;
aud.has been asking questions which Ican&#xD;

has not turned out so well as I"fanced it&#xD;
might. 'I shall require further help from&#xD;
you."1&#xD;
"You are pitiless," returned Jack, in a&#xD;
tone of hopelessness. "You have broken&#xD;
taith with me in placing this hideous&#xD;
brute as a watch upon me ; it has drawn&#xD;
me from ,London in the hope of losing sight&#xD;

in a place that existed within' the last.&#xD;

selves seen it, we will describe.  '&#xD;
An extensive range of'celibrage, situated&#xD;
under a large shop, at'theddirer of one of&#xD;
the great publIc thoroughfares of the West&#xD;
End, had been taken, and, with taste and&#xD;
elegance, was fitted up as "wine vaults;"'&#xD;

Descending a fight of steps out of 'the&#xD;

there follved'a snapping sound like that&#xD;

The count made a tremendous effort, and&#xD;
Hazard stabbed him in the breast. Blow&#xD;
after blow followed, till a perfect raib o&#xD;
blood drenched the clothing of both., The&#xD;

once more he fied,-his head turned over,&#xD;

altogether obliterated, and his arrangements&#xD;
complete.&#xD;
He was not certain whether his lodgings&#xD;
were known to any or not ; but still, as not&#xD;
one came, he began to feel more reassured ;&#xD;
he had so far recovered himself as to ask&#xD;
for the newspaper, and there, to his dismay,&#xD;
vead with alarming accuracy thp particu-&#xD;
lars of the revolting homicide. How the&#xD;
reporter dwelt upon the magnitude of the&#xD;
crime, and the fearful struggle that must&#xD;
have taken place during the conflict. How,&#xD;
with practised judgment,.they had drawn&#xD;
the almost correct conclusions, and thedark&#xD;
hints of the probability of the officers of&#xD;
justice being upon the track of the crimi-&#xD;
nal, almost petrified Hazard with dread of&#xD;
the fatal consequences of this last crowning&#xD;
piece to all his former crimes. The paper&#xD;
dropped from his hands, and for awhile,&#xD;
with motionless limbs and haggard looks.he&#xD;
continued to gaze upon it with the strange&#xD;
fascination with which the frog looks upon&#xD;
the snake about to devour him, but is un-&#xD;
able to avert his eyes, or reive from the&#xD;
spot.&#xD;
His first impulse, upon coming to himself,&#xD;
was to go and deliver himself up ; but the&#xD;
dreadful thought of public execution. and&#xD;
the disgrace that would thus be entailed&#xD;
upon Laura, prevented him. Upon more&#xD;
mature deliberation-a conclusion probably&#xD;
arived at through the instinctive love of&#xD;

mind to return, before it was too late, 1o&#xD;
Berkshire, settle his property upon Laura,&#xD;
and leave his native land forever. But his&#xD;
mental agony increased to such a decree as&#xD;
first part or his resolution was promptly&#xD;
acted upon according tohis wishes, the land&#xD;
to which he journeyed was that bourne from&#xD;
which no traveller ever returns. His brok-&#xD;
en constitution could not bear up against&#xD;
his malady, and a plain tombstone shortly&#xD;
after marked the resting-place of Jack Haz-&#xD;
ard.&#xD;
Laura did not long survive her cousin,&#xD;
A settled melancholy took possession of her,&#xD;
and in a few short months she was borne to&#xD;
the grave amid the tears of all who knew&#xD;
her, and the sorrow of the neighborhood.&#xD;
Before she departed this life she bequeath-&#xD;
ed the whole of the Berkshire estates to a&#xD;
charitable institution, and the hand of provi-&#xD;
dence could be seen in the arranging of&#xD;
events so as to take from out of the hands&#xD;

means for them to indulge in vice, and be-&#xD;
stoW the property upon an institution that&#xD;
was calculated to protect the youth of fu-&#xD;
ture generation from the snares into which&#xD;
the unfortunate Jack Hazard fell.&#xD;
Digges, after a short run, was at length&#xD;
arrested, and convicted of manslaughter,&#xD;
and is now serving the remainder of hig&#xD;
natural life in chains in a penal colon.&#xD;
