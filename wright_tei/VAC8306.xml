As I entered the school-room, this morning, my&#xD;
teacher called me, saying: "Violet, do you remember.&#xD;
it is now the 22d of October, your bir\th-day?"&#xD;
"0O, yes ma'm,y7 said I, " I should think I would, for&#xD;
I received from father a present of Peter Parley's.&#xD;
Tales, and from mother, a very pretty work-box, with&#xD;
needle-book, scissors, thimble, and every thing I need&#xD;
to sew with; besides, the girls gave me a number of&#xD;
whippings, and those I am sure to remember ."&#xD;
"Let me see," said Miss Manton, "you are eleven&#xD;
years old now, quite a large girl-almost too large&#xD;
for a romp, but still you can be of considerable as&#xD;
sistance to your mother and sisters; and are suffi-&#xD;
ciently old, I think, to have your school duties en4&#xD;
larged. Now I am not going to make 'yoau a present,&#xD;
or give you a whipping; but I shall, in future;. give&#xD;
you "-here she made a pause-'"something more to&#xD;
do in your school hours. How would you like that?""&#xD;
"Very well,"  nswered'I, turning quite red in the&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;

face, as she smilingly bent down toward me for my&#xD;
reply; but I don't yet know what you would have&#xD;
me do.&#xD;
"I would like to have you commence writing a&#xD;
Journal. It is quite time you began to put some of&#xD;
those thoughts, which are, knocking at your 'little&#xD;
heart, on paper. Let us see what they will look like?&#xD;
Some of them, I expect, will be a little ild; but no&#xD;
matter; let them come, they will soon be made tame ;&#xD;
and with careful culture, and perseverence, they may&#xD;
yet be a pride and honor to you. Commence by&#xD;
writing this morning's conversation; put down every&#xD;
thing you remember; write a little every day; then&#xD;
you will not forget what occurs to you.  Copy it&#xD;
neatly, and hand it in on Friday morning."&#xD;
The proposition was not very pleasin ; so I told&#xD;
her I didn't know as I could sit still lbng enough. I&#xD;
thought writing was very hard and tedio s, and-as for&#xD;
having any thoughts to write down, I di not believe&#xD;
that I ever had any that I could get old of; for,&#xD;
when I tried to write a letter, so soon as I took p&#xD;
my pen, my ideas flew away like frightened birds.&#xD;
0 O," said she, "if that is the case, then it is high&#xD;
time you disciplined yourself. Ihave long since seen&#xD;
the necessity of tasking you a little more; for you&#xD;
find too much time'to look around you, during school&#xD;
hours. I shall not require any thing you are not&#xD;
able to perform, nor anything but what will be a benefit,&#xD;
and perhaps a blessing. After you hav  written in;&#xD;
that way a few weeks, you will find it quite easy, and&#xD;
will grew to loving it. In after life, you will revert&#xD;
to it, as to the remembrance of a dear friend, and will&#xD;

never forget your teacher's request. Will you try,&#xD;
Violet ?" said Mis Manton.&#xD;
" I will," answered I, " but I don't believeJ I shall&#xD;
succeed."&#xD;
" 0 yes, you wil," said she. You may take your&#xD;
seat now and thiin~ on what I have said."&#xD;
I could scarcely walk up to :my -division, I-was so&#xD;
full of cry. The task looked like a mountin to me.&#xD;
The scholars were singing ; I tried to join them, but&#xD;
soon ceased.. Miss Manton said: "Violet, why do&#xD;
you not sing with ,the scholars?". Every attempt I&#xD;
made was useless, my voice grew so husky; my&#xD;
throat felt as if I ad three or four hard-boiled eggs&#xD;
in it, standing up  dgewise.&#xD;
The more I thi k of my task :the worse I;feel.. I&#xD;
don't want to commence it, any why. i I hdve had&#xD;
poor recitations al1 day. I cannot keep it out of my&#xD;
mind one minute, not even at night. I keep dream-&#xD;
ing-dreaming of it continually. . I do think it is very&#xD;
hard of my teacher, to require me to write-a Journal!&#xD;
There are larger  irls than I, upon whom she never&#xD;
thinks of imposin such duties. There isMry Hart,&#xD;
who sits near, w o has no more to do than 1 have.&#xD;
For my part, I do not see why she does not require i&#xD;
her to work. I r ther think Miss Manton will. soon&#xD;
tire ofit; for I shial have enough to say about her,&#xD;
I know. Who w nts to write down every thing he,&#xD;
has done through the day ? I do not, I am sure;; I&#xD;
am always doing aughty things. I gmmit so .many&#xD;
wrong actions, I hall have little else to talk about.&#xD;
Then how silly it seems, to talk of one'eself all the&#xD;
time. I told fath r of it yesterday, expecting at least&#xD;

he would say he was sorry, and would c&#xD;
an effort to speak to the teacher abo&#xD;
seemed much pleased, and said it was&#xD;
idea, at the same time appealing to m&#xD;
opinion.&#xD;
"It will be good discipline," said fate&#xD;
echoed "yes, it will; for she is wild&#xD;
she needs something to tame her."&#xD;
Only think of it ! everybody speaks c&#xD;
wild animal just escaped from a menager&#xD;
as if I could not contain myself. I am s&#xD;
hateful word discipline, discipline, DIS&#xD;
sounds, in my ears from morning till n&#xD;
only last night Miss Manton gave her fir&#xD;
classes a long lecture on the subject.&#xD;
was good enough, but I am so tired of&#xD;
suppose because everybody says I nee&#xD;
I expect to be obliged to write down w&#xD;
her of that to-morrow. Recess bell ha&#xD;
have no more time for writing. Now f&#xD;

VIOLET:,&#xD;
&#xD;
The first thing I did this morning&#xD;
dressing, was to speak cross to little Su&#xD;
years-old sister, who asked me to get&#xD;
her shoe-string; I snatched it so rudely&#xD;
she cried; and when I returned it to h&#xD;
ugly a manner as possible:&#xD;
"There Miss, take it! don't you ever&#xD;
such a thing again! Thenext knot, you&#xD;
yourself."&#xD;
When I went down to breakfast, I t&#xD;
my wash basin. I did not give ttent&#xD;
was doing; and I suspect I did not car&#xD;
so I spilled the water all the way dow&#xD;
ping it to the sink. As we were seatin&#xD;
the table, mother called out:&#xD;
" Which of you spilled the water a&#xD;
wiped?"&#xD;
Carrie answered, (she's always telling&#xD;
believe,) "Violet did; I saw her !"&#xD;
"Violet; you know better than to le&#xD;
in that condition; get a cloth and wipe&#xD;
I felt contrary, so got up pouting and&#xD;
chair against the side of the house. Fat&#xD;
back, ordering me to set the ch ir qui&#xD;
scuffed; so he compelled me to return:&#xD;
should, "like a lady," he said.&#xD;
I took the floor cloth with the tips o&#xD;
and brushed it lightly over the water, ba&#xD;
forwards; mother 'stood watching and&#xD;
me saying:,&#xD;
"Put .your hand do'gn to it, Violet,&#xD;
well."&#xD;
&#xD;
when I was.&#xD;
sie, my three-&#xD;
knot out of&#xD;

and walk as I&#xD;
my fingers,&#xD;

approached&#xD;

daintily, when rm&#xD;
pressed it down to&#xD;

ping it deliberately, touching it&#xD;
ther took hold of my hand, and&#xD;
the cloth, saying:&#xD;
d, and wipe it as you ought."&#xD;
I not to obey her; but she stood&#xD;
d performed-my duty faithfully.&#xD;
ck to the table my father said:&#xD;
ay leave the table until we call&#xD;
&#xD;
you."&#xD;
That command put the finishing touch to my ill-&#xD;
humor; and I commenced crying right heartily.&#xD;
Most bitterly did I repent of my conduct when alone.&#xD;
I thought of the unhappiness I had- created around&#xD;
me ; how disagreeable I had appeared to others, and&#xD;
how wretched I had made myself. I thought too of&#xD;
the tempting food I had left untasted, consisting of&#xD;
rice cakes, delicately small biscuits and fresh fish,.&#xD;
which I love so well ! Every thing tended to increase&#xD;
my discomfort. My parents seemed to be in earnest&#xD;
conversation. How I did wish I could know what&#xD;
they were saying. Pretty soon they all laughed'&#xD;
heartily.  "What could it be about," thought I.&#xD;
Then the aggravating rattle of knives and forks fell&#xD;
fresh upon my ears, as I pursued my unpleasant re-.&#xD;
flections. "When I return to the table every thing&#xD;
will be cold and' comfortless ; besides no one will sit&#xD;
near me, to whom I can smile, or with whom I can&#xD;
speak, and that is not a pleasant prospect, at all.&#xD;
This thoughtful conclusion produced a fresh passion&#xD;
cf tears."&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
OUR parents are very pious. They&#xD;
ticular as to our behavior at. home, as v&#xD;
and when we go to the table, we are o&#xD;
orderly, and move our chairs quietly&#xD;
noisy, and rough, that I have to be s&#xD;
often.&#xD;
When father says grace at table, w&#xD;
omits, he wishes us to sit with our hanu&#xD;
our laps; but just as sure as it is quietly&#xD;
am sure to laugh, especially if I ought&#xD;
never could smother it as some do, lbut&#xD;
outright, so that everybody bears me.&#xD;
Cousin Joseph, from Buffalo, has b(&#xD;
for some time ; he is a very pleasant m&#xD;
but he really delights in tormenting&#xD;
me, for he knows how easy it is to&#xD;
laughter or my tears. He sits next me&#xD;
and I hardly know how to behave wh&#xD;
This noon, when father was asking a ble&#xD;
my eyes to cousin Joseph's face, and&#xD;
comical, with his brow drawn almost&#xD;
and with such an unnaturally sober facec&#xD;
right with merriment, forgetting entirely&#xD;
place. Father reproved me very severe]&#xD;
opened her beautiful, large, dark-blue e&#xD;
the tears filled mine.&#xD;
Whilst I was eating,. cousin Joseph k&#xD;
my dre s, and very slyly hitting my eli&#xD;
&#xD;
are very par-&#xD;
Tell as abroad ;,&#xD;
bliged to walk&#xD;
but Iam so&#xD;
'eproved very&#xD;
which he rarely&#xD;
s folded upon&#xD;
around me, 1L&#xD;
not to ; and I&#xD;
Lave to giggle&#xD;
en visiting us&#xD;
an, full of fun,&#xD;
us, especially&#xD;
provoke my&#xD;
at the table,.&#xD;

I burst out-&#xD;

y, and mother&#xD;
es at me, till&#xD;
ept pulling at&#xD;
ow ; then he&#xD;
&#xD;
whispered something in my ear, whichmade. me titter&#xD;
till I laughed aloud; when father looked much dis.&#xD;
turbed, and told me "I mist not sit with them at&#xD;
table till I could learn to behave properly."&#xD;
After dinner, mother told me she was very much&#xD;
pained and mortified at my conduct and example, and&#xD;
that she was nearly discouraged at making anything&#xD;
of me. I believe her, for I don't think I shall ever&#xD;
act like other people. I shall never know how to be&#xD;
good enough to eat- a meal with the family, when it&#xD;
is brought in nice and hot.  I declare! I do wish I&#xD;
as a woman; then I could laugh just as much as t&#xD;
want to. I don't like restraint better now, than when&#xD;
I was a little, very little girl. Mother says whenever&#xD;
she wished to do anything very particular, and di"&#xD;
not want me in her way, she would resort to tying&#xD;
me up; but when she did, I was sure to let the whole&#xD;
neighborhood know it, by my violent screams, and&#xD;
sraggles to liberate myself, although the line would&#xD;
be long enough to permit me to visit any part of the&#xD;
yard.&#xD;
If cousin Joseph had done right, he w  d have&#xD;
told father it was his fault, not mine. I did not feet&#xD;
myself to blame this time- but I did not wish 1to&#xD;
inform against him, for he is usually so kind to us&#xD;
carrying us out walking, riding and sailing, besides&#xD;
he is a great hand at playing ball or. graces; and i,&#xD;
ever ready to join us.&#xD;
This morning, I awoke very early, long before&#xD;
light.  Grandma perceiving me, told me to got&#xD;
bed again, and when it was time to rise she would&#xD;
call me. She refused to answer any of my questions&#xD;

I tried to awaken sister Annie in or&#xD;
about it; but she wished to sleep, a&#xD;

all by myself, as to the why and whe&#xD;

never knew mother to have compa&#xD;

-stay all day or not, I fell to dreamin&#xD;

smoothed my hair, took me by the h'&#xD;
very quiet, and led me into the next:&#xD;
where, to my great surprise, lay m&#xD;
very, very pale.&#xD;
"Why, I didn't know mother was&#xD;

"ihush! hush !" said Grandma, an&#xD;

r little eyes were&#xD;
lor: but I could&#xD;
&#xD;
131&#xD;
&#xD;
see her mouth, which was just sweet enough to kiss.&#xD;
Mother allowed me to stroke her head; it was a l&#xD;
covered with soft, brown hair, in short rings, curling&#xD;
close into her neck; and right in the middle of her&#xD;
little head, there was a small place that beat so fast,&#xD;
it seemed as if one could hear its throbbings. Little&#xD;
Susie asked Grandma if the heart grew away up there,&#xD;
and said it looked as if it were dancing. Then she&#xD;
cried because Grandma would not let her take the&#xD;
aby .in her arms; but mother pacified her by saying&#xD;
s e should play with her all the time, when a little&#xD;
lder.&#xD;
While we were talking, a strange woman entered&#xD;
the room, bearing some gruel on a tray, telling us if&#xD;
e didn't want to make our mother very ill, we mut&#xD;
go out now, that we might come in at night a little&#xD;
vhile, if we wo ld be very quiet. Grandma gaveus&#xD;
each a piece of cake, telling us to be good children&#xD;
a d conduct at he table just'as if our mother were&#xD;
present, all of which we readily promised, as we be-&#xD;
stowed our good-bye kiss. I was going out on tiptoe&#xD;
but just as I neared the door, being unfoiqnate as&#xD;
usual, I stumbled over a chair, and made a great&#xD;
noise, which woke the baby. .She gave a scream loud&#xD;
e ough to frighten away the mice playing in the wall&#xD;
th4 nurse came up to me saying that she should ndt&#xD;
let me see my mother again until I could make lesi&#xD;
n ise. Dear me ! I could have cried, only I was de&#xD;
t rmined not to, for I was not pleased with the ma&#xD;
n r'in which I was addressed. I didn't do it pur-&#xD;
posely, and she knew it: but Grandma says "It is&#xD;
jijst like you, always making an unlucky noise."'I&#xD;

don't believe I was ever still a moment in my life.&#xD;
Didn't we have a nice time, though,at the break-&#xD;
fast table ! Father, and all the men h d eaten; so we&#xD;
had the table all to ourselves.  Sister Annie said, as&#xD;
she was the oldest, she would play mother ; we all&#xD;
agreed to it, provided for once we could talk as much&#xD;
as we wanted to.&#xD;
When Annie passed me my cup of milk and water,&#xD;
susie jogged my elbow, asking me to hand her some&#xD;
johnny-cake; I did not have the c p firmly in my&#xD;
hand, so I spilt its contents over Carrie's clean dress.&#xD;
Now Carrie is just as opposite to -e as possible.&#xD;
She, is. the neatest little body one  versaw.  She&#xD;
feels very badly if she soils or tears her clothing in&#xD;
the least; and when she is so unfortunate, which is&#xD;
seldom, she can mend the ren as easily as any woman.&#xD;
Mother says she will make a good house-keeper by&#xD;
and by, she is so orderly.&#xD;
Now if it had been me, I should not have been&#xD;
alarmed at all; but Carrie felt very badly about it.&#xD;
Annie said she would try and iron i for her in time&#xD;
for school. Peace being restored, w had a fine time&#xD;
talkin&#xD;
Annie said she was up the first on  this morning.&#xD;
Granc ma woke her, and told her not to rouse me just&#xD;
then.  She said she held the baby in her. arms some&#xD;
minutes, and 'twas as light as Carrie's baby doll. We&#xD;
all tried to think of some very pretty name for her.,&#xD;
Susie lisped out, "I thould .like to hiave her named&#xD;
Ella."- After bringing up a great variety of names,&#xD;
we concluded that Susie's was the best of all.&#xD;

After Breakfast, Carrie went round the house sini&#xD;
"How pleased and blest wasI,&#xD;
To hear the baby cry,.&#xD;
Come let us find 1er name to-day.'&#xD;
&#xD;
Brother William told her notto sing that any iore;&#xD;
bit Carrie loved to tease as well as the rest' of us; so&#xD;
sh Q would, every now and then, sing it in Williaths'&#xD;
ears. H bore it quite patiently for a little time;&#xD;
then he jumped up suddenly from; the door-sill, where&#xD;
he was sketching, to give h er chase, when he dropped&#xD;
h s paper. I, perceiving i ,felt mischievous, as usual,&#xD;
s held it up triumphantly to him, and ran down the&#xD;

Ca4rie, whio was half laughing,. half crying, and strug&#xD;
glig to free herself, when he started in pursuit of&#xD;
me dragging Carrie with im. I was just climbing&#xD;
u n something beyond h s reach, when he grasped&#xD;
a option of my dress, which secured me. He then&#xD;

up with leaves and flowers.. He come into the house,&#xD;
very often to have a quiet talk with mother; and when&#xD;
he does; mother is sure to have a bowl of molasses&#xD;

When he leaves us, he blesses us, and calls us his&#xD;

The other day in passing him, on going to.school&#xD;
he put his hand on my head and said-" May God&#xD;

the soft pressure of his hand; and'th pleasant words&#xD;
kept. coming continually in my ear. I think that is'&#xD;
why I had' such good recitations. ]I Ielieve that even&#xD;
the least word of kindness, makes  e strong to do&#xD;
right, and helps me to persevere in ny undertaking.&#xD;

I have caused her much trouble and pain. I must&#xD;

reports as to behavior. When I wished to speak with&#xD;
another scholar I was allowed to, provided I was&#xD;
quiet;about it. I did one thing which I- well, remem-&#xD;

CHAPTER    III-&#xD;
School time has come again, and I don't know that,&#xD;
I am sorry, for.I am beginning to feel very much in--&#xD;
terested in study.&#xD;
Mother says she has found me very useful, the past&#xD;
week in holding the baby, wiping dishes, sweeping&#xD;
and dusting.&#xD;
We expected to have a very pleasant time at vaca-&#xD;
tion, but our holiday season was saddened by the&#xD;
death of our dear Grandpa. It makesline feel very&#xD;
sad. It seems to me, I feel his last kiss even now on"&#xD;
my cheek.. When . .entered his room I found him&#xD;
propped up by his pillows; father, mother and aunts&#xD;
were all weeping. Soon as Grandpa aw me, he put.&#xD;
his hand out  d drew me toward, hir for a farewell;&#xD;
kiss. Oh dear it seems so lonely to live without my.&#xD;
dear, old friend. When I hear little girls callings&#xD;
grandpa, it makes me start and choke. It was so&#xD;
nice to be petted by him, to sit on his knee, with hi,&#xD;
hand resting 'on my head. Our grandpa seemed very;&#xD;
fond of us, and seemed to try to interest us in many.&#xD;
ways. At times on going to.school, he would meet:&#xD;
us, and stooping, would spread put his arms, saying,;&#xD;
"Come buss your dear father." _, That's the word he;&#xD;
used when he wished us to kiss him; and he taught&#xD;
me to say, dear father, and dear mother.. Some of,&#xD;
the girls laugh at me for it; but J don't care much if"&#xD;
they do. M4er says I must never blush for doingm.:&#xD;

let's; see the contrast," says he as lie opens my trunk;&#xD;
and you will hear the company laugh heartily as they&#xD;
respond: "Well, everything is in admirable confusion&#xD;
here! It looks like a museum. See here are bits of&#xD;
colored paper, old drawings, stones, shells, pieces of&#xD;
old flowers, torn books, broken paint boxes with the&#xD;
paints scattered all around, broken slates and bits of&#xD;
pencils, half worn baby socks, and little green shoes,&#xD;
all mixed in a heap with her clothes."&#xD;
Carrie's baby house is in complete order, while&#xD;
mine, mother says, looks as if the witches had been&#xD;
playing with it. Even when Carrie plays in the sand,&#xD;
she returns to the house just as clean as when she&#xD;
went out; the dirt does n't stick to her, but has quite&#xD;
an affection for me-an affinity as they call it, of the&#xD;
earth, earthy. I am always playing in it; and it seems&#xD;
to like me.&#xD;
I don't know as father ever can\do any thing With&#xD;
me, as Aunt Katy told mother the other day, when I&#xD;
caine in the house with my skirt torn half off. I&#xD;
really do not wonder that she said so, for I always&#xD;
happen to tear my clothes whin she comes.. Mother&#xD;
looked very much discouraged, to see my new school&#xD;
dress rent so badly: I think I had worn it but a few&#xD;
days, when, in playing " catch," I ran against a board&#xD;
of the garden fence which was loose. It is strange,&#xD;
I never see any nails, or boards. I am always falling'&#xD;
or running over somebody; and if any old lady comes&#xD;
to visit mother, the first thing she does is to move&#xD;
out of my way, and if Icome near, she will cry-&#xD;
"Take care of my corns,' or, "1Oh dear! Violet, you&#xD;

mouth."&#xD;
3ek I was hurrying to school when I ran&#xD;
e iron ball of the faiing belonging to the&#xD;
Mrs. Brown's house. I was thrown down&#xD;
force, striking my temple and hurting nme&#xD;
rs. Brown came out of the house saying-&#xD;
le dear ! are yoA hurt ?' So she took hold&#xD;
helped me in the house, bathed my head,&#xD;
water to drink, then brought me out a piece&#xD;
,eat. I thought myself fully compensated&#xD;
,by the kindness. Blessings on that dear,&#xD;
ady, I shall always love her. Through the&#xD;
Lool, and two or three times in the night,&#xD;
would say, "Poor little dear;" I loved to&#xD;
pression, it was like a pleasant tone of mu-&#xD;
m it did me good, for it really seemed as&#xD;
e loved me.                       /&#xD;
ry wild, noisy, restless little girl-not very&#xD;

tall as my mother. When I forget how;&#xD;
[ am quite destructive, and curi s, as to&#xD;
who comes in contact with me. I never&#xD;
with my playthings until I see the inside,&#xD;
ow they are constructed. Mother has&#xD;
hing nice brought to her, but I am uneasy&#xD;
w where she has placed it. I like to look&#xD;
tney to see how it ij put together; and go&#xD;
e roof of the house-to see how the spout&#xD;

A TRUE STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
body looks so funny, so small, just like the fairies I&#xD;
have read of.           '&#xD;
Somehow I always forget father's commands with&#xD;
regard to my going on the roof. After returning&#xD;
from school last night, I thought I'd just go up for a&#xD;
little while, to see the sunset, when I said to myself,&#xD;
" What a good view I could have here of the street,&#xD;
where I could observe everything going on."  After&#xD;
resting a moment there, I felt tempted very strongly&#xD;
to go down to the edge of the roof, so did not re-&#xD;
member the warning father gave me. I went first to&#xD;
one corner, then the other; while I was looking&#xD;
around I thought I saw a gentleman cast his .eye&#xD;
toward me ; but as he walked along very leisurely,&#xD;
I concluded that I must be mistaken. Very soon I&#xD;
heard father call, "Violet." I looked up and per-&#xD;
ceived him beckoning to me. I. walked up very&#xD;
-carefully ; ,when near my father, he extended his&#xD;
hand to assist me in; then he talked very seriously,&#xD;
and asked me if I knew what I deserved. I remem-&#xD;
bered v:ell his promise, in case I disobeyed him, and&#xD;
in that respect received just what I expected, a go od&#xD;
whipping and an "early to bed."  When I thought&#xD;
seriously about it, I could not blame him for his fears,&#xD;
although I had none, and it was quite difficult to&#xD;
understand why be had any, unless it was because he&#xD;
is older, and can perceive danger where I do not&#xD;
dream of it. I cannot say it will make me better as&#xD;
to climbing, for it is so natural, I forget all commands&#xD;
when the temptation is presented to rame. .I make a&#xD;
great many good resolutions ; but when I am enjoy-&#xD;

We have very plesant .times together; there's Wil-&#xD;

do pity little girls who have no brothers and sisters,&#xD;

we were coming home from school, it rained the hard-&#xD;

home my crown was washed out entirely.&#xD;
I remember a severe storm when I was a little girl.&#xD;
It rained quite hard when we started for school, but&#xD;
mother did not think it best for us to remain at home,&#xD;
for we were tell protected with homespun plaid'&#xD;
woolen dresses high aprons, pantalettes like the&#xD;
dresses, stout shoes,, ,cloaks, hoods and mittens; so&#xD;
there was piot much danger'of taking cold, unless we,&#xD;
were very careless. The storm increased rapidly ;&#xD;
and when it was time to return home at night, it was&#xD;
violent. Fatlier was there with. the umbrellas, and&#xD;
we thought we could get along nicely under his pro-&#xD;
tection;, and so we did, until we were turning the&#xD;
corner of the Parade. I being the youngest, father&#xD;
took me. in his arms! holding an umbrella over my&#xD;
head. The other he gave to sister Annie, and told&#xD;
her to walk beside him. Just as we were turning the&#xD;

wanted to work on my drawings, but staid so long&#xD;
under the bed, I had barely time to reach school be-&#xD;
fore the second bell had rung. I was unhappy about&#xD;
it all day, and could not rest until I had asked her&#xD;
pardon.&#xD;
We have our tasks to perform daily. .Saturdays&#xD;
we have a double share of work. Each one knows&#xD;
her duty. We take turns for each coming week, in&#xD;
grinding coffee, sifting meal and flour, cleaning silver&#xD;
and brass, and washing dishes. Grandfather used to&#xD;
call us his little bees; he would say, "That's right,&#xD;
gather your honey while you're young ! There's no&#xD;
prettier sight, than little children trying to make&#xD;
themselves useful."&#xD;
0 what will become of me ! The good, sound, prosy.&#xD;
counsel of my advisers turns into music and ripples&#xD;

on the improvement of time ; when lo, this morning&#xD;
it comes jumping back again, with a question so deep&#xD;
I cannot answer. But I'll write it here; and perhaps&#xD;

finding it out. Well, as I say, I am ever in the way-&#xD;
can we help what is natural? -When my mother is&#xD;
about to turn her cakes out, I almost put my head in&#xD;
her mouth, so eager am I to secure the drops. Many s&#xD;
the one she has broken, through my means, from an&#xD;
unlucky hit of the elbow; and then-" Can I have&#xD;
it? is echoed by several voices; and mine is by no&#xD;
means the-lowest and softest.&#xD;
In the Fall of the year, everybody's mother, as well&#xD;
as mine, preserves fruit for the winter.   One very&#xD;
lovely day I saw the preparations going on for the&#xD;
doing up of Quinces, and other good things ; and "0,"&#xD;
thought I," if it would only rain, so I could stay at&#xD;
home this afternoon-rain ever, and ever so hard-,&#xD;
thunder and lightning, I don't care what-wouldn't I&#xD;
then have a nice time ? I know I would," I said em-&#xD;
phatically to myself.&#xD;
When I came home to dinner, I thought I would&#xD;
step into the cook-house, and take a peep at the quin-&#xD;
ces. mother was just dipping them into the jars.&#xD;
How could I withstand the temptation?&#xD;
"Oh ! dear! I must have just one taste, a Yvery little&#xD;
one ;" I said, takinga spoon in my hand.&#xD;
" Take care, Violet! you'll get burned }ere! get&#xD;
out of the way, Miss Busy-body!" were t.e words&#xD;
which went in at one ear and out at the other.&#xD;
"Just one, one drop, mother! I'll be very careful;"&#xD;
said I.. So I seated myself in a low, old-fashioned flag&#xD;
chair, with my spoon at the side of the jar.&#xD;
Some .one was entering the room at the time, and I&#xD;
turned my head to see; for I can't bear tl e idea of&#xD;
any one's passing me, without knowing who it is. As'&#xD;

A TRUE STORY..&#xD;
&#xD;
ied h stily I saw one of my sisters on the other&#xD;
of me. Not noticing my chair, she was bending&#xD;
rd slightly, and tripped over it, pushing me over&#xD;
thrusting my right hand, which was carelessly&#xD;
g on the jar, into the scalding quince.&#xD;
dear ! oh dear! wasn't I burned -badly? It&#xD;
seem to me as if I could bear it! HowI did&#xD;
Not all the cakes, candies, baby-things and fun-&#xD;
)ries, that were constructed for my relief, could&#xD;
me. My burns seemed to smart harder and&#xD;
r every moment; I cried most of the afternoon,&#xD;
ought I would much rather have gone to school&#xD;
ut such a bitter experience. The taste was not&#xD;
ng at all. I don't think, after such a warm trial,&#xD;
ild have the courage to walk through a fiery&#xD;
ce, as Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego did.&#xD;

on in Arithmetic ; she showed my writing book&#xD;
e of the Committee, who encouraged me very&#xD;
ry Halt says, she is going next term to n Acad-&#xD;
that it is not considered fashionable to attend&#xD;
School, and none of the girls who think any-&#xD;
of themselves would be seen going.    She&#xD;
d to lnow why I didn't leave. I told her I was&#xD;

vrIOLET!&#xD;
&#xD;
Cork, in Ireland, to Newport. Our house is the first&#xD;
place of refuge she has found. Mother was revailed&#xD;
upon to take her and teach her. She commits many&#xD;
funny mistakes.&#xD;
One day mother said, "Bridget, go out into the&#xD;
gook-house, and bring in the clothes-horse." After&#xD;
being absent 'some time she returned, leading a live&#xD;
horse by the bridle. He was very noisy; and.on his&#xD;
resisting, she tried to force him up the steps, saying,&#xD;
"An' indade ma'm, an' he won't come no how."&#xD;
Another time, mother sent he for the spider; and&#xD;
she returned after a lengthy time, with a live speci'&#xD;
men in her hand.   She approached mother with it&#xD;
poised on the tips of two fingers, saying, "AA' indade,&#xD;
ma'm, it's all the bit of spider Ian find; I kilt him&#xD;
intirely, by knockin' the breath out of his black body'&#xD;
before I etched him; an' it's me that would like to&#xD;
know, please your ladyship, what yell do with him,&#xD;
the ugly black thing.'''&#xD;
.;Mother says she is a good-hea ted, but a very wild,&#xD;
enthusiastic creature, and much devoted to her Ca-&#xD;
tholic fornis of religion. We have a small hcuse built&#xD;
in the lower part of the yard or the pigs Every&#xD;
morning before daylight, or if s e has a moment to&#xD;
spare through the day, she will seat. herself on the&#xD;
roof of the sty, to say her prayers. It matters not&#xD;
how hard the wind blows, or how cold the air is, or&#xD;
whether it storms, or is sunshine she is not deterred&#xD;
from going there. Sometimes she will take a wider&#xD;
range, leap over the fence and o over to the field&#xD;
opposite, end perch upon a stone wall, or kneel in&#xD;
the midst. 'f the snow.&#xD;

A TRUE STORY.               35&#xD;
It s a strange, almost unearthly, but highly pictur-&#xD;
esqu sight, to see her far out in the distant field,&#xD;
knee ing in. that sea of snow, often reaching. up to her&#xD;
waist with her long, black, straight hair streaming in&#xD;
the  ind, er uncovered arms resting upon the snow,&#xD;
her  hands clasped, or counting her beads, and her&#xD;
face pturned to Heaven. 0,if I were only a painter,&#xD;
what a fine 'picture she would make, taken in one of&#xD;
her evotional moods.&#xD;
Su set-brilliant, beautiful, is before me.. Every.&#xD;
thing on which I gaze, is clothed with it. 0 how it&#xD;
does efresfh my heart, stirring up the very depths of&#xD;
my soul in prayer ! Few dream how strongly this&#xD;
wild heart of mine beats to everything that is lovely&#xD;
and good! I hope the time may come when the good&#xD;
thou hts can soften, and work their way out into my&#xD;
chara ter.  Often, when night approaches with her&#xD;
pleas nt quiet, I feel my soul lit up by their beauty,&#xD;
and the remembrance of them the following day often&#xD;
rem i s, like the sweet essence of roses, to cheer and&#xD;
comfort me.&#xD;

A TRiUE STORY.&#xD;

Miss M nton gave us an excellent lectures&#xD;
acter and discipline, last evening. There's 1&#xD;
again ! Iam beginning to be reconciled tc&#xD;
know I n ed it more than almost any one.&#xD;
Bridget is very  kind  to  us  all, and  )voulc&#xD;
indulgent~ could she have her own way.&#xD;
day Carrie was told to clean the silver&amp;amp; spo&#xD;
Bridget ook them out of her hand, saying&#xD;
little thing,.she shant do it, an' it's too bad&#xD;
delicate little hands."&#xD;
Mother reproved her very gently, but f&#xD;
told her she must never interfere with he,&#xD;
ments, that she knew what w's best for&#xD;
girls, for she wanted them to 'row up to&#xD;
Said she, "If they learn while oung, work&#xD;
easier ; and then when they are oldei, th&#xD;
able to fill any station in life to advantage.&#xD;
Last S turday, mother let me mix the bro&#xD;

and one very difficult to overcome when fully&#xD;

We enjoyed ourselves finely last evening before&#xD;
the lights were brought in. Mr. Linden took Carrie&#xD;
on his knee ; Mr. Hodges, Ella; and Annie and I&#xD;
grouped around; while Susie, for a wonder was&#xD;
mother's baby. The gentlemen entertained us high-&#xD;
ly by relating, for our pleasure, many anecdotes, and&#xD;
amusing incidents connected with their own lives,&#xD;
their own families, and the little girls they had met.&#xD;
Before we retired for the night they wished us to&#xD;
say our prayers and verses to 'them. Ella com-&#xD;
menced her's first. She is very fond of coarse&#xD;
bread; and when she came to the words, "Give us&#xD;
this day our daily bread," she added,' " Gaham, Lord;'&#xD;
and then went on with her prayer. It seemed as if&#xD;
I should scream! ITdid not dare to look at the girls.&#xD;
Even mother smiled a little ; and so did the ministers.&#xD;
But they soon grew sober again, and closed with&#xD;
prayer. After this they bade us an affectionate adieu,&#xD;
as they were to leave Very early in the morning for&#xD;
their homes.&#xD;
This morning Carrie was looking out of the win-&#xD;

When I first commenced, it was with. rather a&#xD;
feeling of sport, not .in ridicule of the observance,&#xD;
however, but it was not long ere I warmed with my&#xD;
subject, which was, "Christ blessing little children ;"&#xD;
and then I addressed them earnestly, causing them to&#xD;
shed a few tears by my pathetic entreaties. We then&#xD;
concluded services with prayer from each member.&#xD;
After reciting all the prayers and verses we knew,&#xD;
Susie repeated, "Now I lay me down to sleep." and&#xD;
concluded with, "Mary had a little lamb;" I could&#xD;
not help smiling if I was kneeling with my hands&#xD;
clasped on the Bible, for it was bright sunshine, and&#xD;
would not be her bed-time for two hours or-more ;&#xD;

doubly interesting. Our father is Superintendent,&#xD;
and his school is said to be one of the most flourish-&#xD;

many members. He hhs also an unusually large adult&#xD;
class, numbering men and women upwards of eighty&#xD;
years, who barely totter with their canes, and whose&#xD;
voices tremble so they can scarcely speak. What a&#xD;
testimony is this to the value of learning! Young&#xD;

of one little boy that lived in his fan'ily, who was an&#xD;
orphan, and without any friends to care for him, and&#xD;
how warmly the little fellow was att ched to him.&#xD;
He described him as -being very att -active in his&#xD;
disposition, with an eager thirst for knowledge.&#xD;
There were many moist eyes, when we heard how&#xD;
the little heathen boy loved to hear about the&#xD;
Savior. He said that a little while previous to his&#xD;
leaving home, the little boy was taken ill; he told&#xD;
him he had but a short time to live. On hearing it&#xD;
the boy plead thai he might be baptised. He lived&#xD;
only a few hours after the baptism; and died making&#xD;
one request, which was, to be buried by the sea, in&#xD;
the sand.&#xD;
"Why do you wish to be buried there ?" was&#xD;
asked.&#xD;
"Because the worms can't find me," and then he&#xD;
added, "arid Jesus Christ will nothave to look for&#xD;
me.&#xD;
He wished the Missionary to thank the little&#xD;
American children for sending the Bible and kind&#xD;
teachers to them. The Missionary exhibited mafy&#xD;
idols, giving explanations in \regard to them, apd&#xD;
showed us.very pretty articles of merchandise.&#xD;
There was a very beautiful Pagoda exhibited. It&#xD;
was pure marble nearly a 'yard in height, gnd was for&#xD;
sale.. There were besides, stones, shells and various&#xD;
articles of Indian workmanship; the proceeds of&#xD;
which, when sold, will be for the purpose of building&#xD;
a Church. There was singing after each speech,&#xD;
the services concluding with a short touching appeal.&#xD;
to all hearts, and a prayer.&#xD;

rned Mary.&#xD;
hing a map of the&#xD;
ered the room. I&#xD;
&#xD;
did not then observe what she was doing, but saw&#xD;
very readily when I seated myself. The afternoon&#xD;
was very muddy. Mary had completely covered the&#xD;
soles of.her shoes with mud, and stood on the !seat&#xD;
and desk, after which she had rubbed ink upon it&#xD;
to drip in upon my books.&#xD;
No one can .imagine how I felt as she gave me&#xD;
such an exulting, scornful laugh, and whispered out,&#xD;
"How do you like that? it looks quite showy,&#xD;
doesn't it ?"&#xD;
I felt the blood boiling in my face with anger; the&#xD;
next minute I was so wounded, it was with difficulty&#xD;
I could restrain my tears.&#xD;
"Would I have treated any one so ?" said I to&#xD;
myself.  "No; never, never !"  My .mind was so&#xD;
troubled in. regard to it, that I failed in two of my&#xD;
recitations; and Mary laughed as she gave a sly&#xD;
pull at my dress as I was being sent down in the&#xD;
class.&#xD;
Miss Manton, for the past few weeks, has been&#xD;
quite ill; and her place has been filled by Miss Free-&#xD;
man, a lady from the West, who is intimate with the&#xD;
family of Mr. Hart. Feeling my own inability to&#xD;
obtain redress, and scorning to retaliate upon Mary,&#xD;
angered and hurt with the cruel indignity, I went to&#xD;
Miss Freeman and stated the facts. She said there&#xD;
must be some mistake; she never knew Mary to&#xD;
possess such a disposition; she would call her, and&#xD;
enquire into it.&#xD;
"Mary Hart, what time did you enter school this,&#xD;
morning ?"&#xD;

answered.&#xD;
" Mary, id you have the unkindn&#xD;
mud upon Violet's desk?&#xD;
"NO m 'am," said Mary ; "I m&#xD;
hang my lothes on the nail, put.m&#xD;
and be s ated before you entere&#xD;
round I saw Violet rubbing ink and&#xD;
desk. I asked why she did tha&#xD;

you that I did it."&#xD;
"Very   ell  I must see to this.&#xD;
"Violet ho v can you be so wick&#xD;
me with sch a bold lie upon your l&#xD;

Miss Fr emin would not listen t&#xD;
say, but called the school to orde&#xD;
facts, as s e called them.&#xD;
Winnie Wright raised her hand&#xD;
did not believe Violet Angel ever&#xD;
"for Miss Manton says"-&#xD;
She wa goiug to say something&#xD;
Freeman told her that was suffice&#xD;
seated.  he called me out and&#xD;
ferruling, and sent me to my seat, t&#xD;
saying th t if I ever repeated. t e&#xD;

&#xD;
She then showed me a pencil and picture she had&#xD;
taken out of Miss Manton's desk.&#xD;
"Give me some of your drawing -paper will you,"&#xD;
she continued. I made her no answer, but bent my&#xD;
eyes to my book, when she said:&#xD;
" If you don't I wiTl tell Miss Freeman something&#xD;
about you !" As I took no notice of her, she went&#xD;
up to Miss Freeman, handed the pencil and drawing&#xD;
and whispered in her ear.&#xD;
"The school may stop their recitations," said Miss&#xD;
Freeman, looking very angry ; Violet Angel, come&#xD;
here 1"&#xD;
I started up in affright, and the tears filled my eyes&#xD;
as I walked up to the platfornt, for sad misgivings of&#xD;
what Mary Hart had done entered my mind, and I&#xD;
felt the cruel fate I was to receive.&#xD;
" Violet Angel, did you take' these things out?"&#xD;
and she held them up in view of the pupils, as she&#xD;
added, "and break the school rules by whispering,&#xD;
asking Mary Hart for drawing paper ?"&#xD;
" No ma'am," answered I; looking her full in the&#xD;
face, for by this time. I was completely roused.&#xD;
"Mary Hart," said I, loud enough for all the school&#xD;
to hear, "showed them to me, and asked me for the&#xD;
, paper; and I made her no answer.&#xD;
"You bold bad girl,"" said Miss Freenan; "what&#xD;
will become of you?   Was there ever a teacher&#xD;
punished with such a wicked, hardened scholar as&#xD;
you are ? I should n't wonder if you would be struck&#xD;
down dead, any minutes"&#xD;
Just then several girls in the farther part of the&#xD;
room, raised their hands. Among them was Winnie&#xD;

Wright, one to Lwhom I always ip ol'u  in my little&#xD;
troubles and d fficulties. Said she, "Miss Freeman,&#xD;
Violet did not o it; I saw Mary Hrt ake them out&#xD;
of Miss Manton's desk this mornin  and show them&#xD;

"I saw Mary, Hart whisper;". " nd I ;" "and I,",&#xD;
was echoed around the room very d sti ctly.&#xD;
"I shall punish the first young 1 dy hat speaks,"&#xD;
:said Miss Free an.&#xD;
She then addressed the school, s ok 'a long time&#xD;
:about my hard, wicked, stubborn he rt. She said she&#xD;
-did not believe God would ever have mercy upon me;&#xD;
that it was her duty to punish me v ry severely; for&#xD;
,such a habit must be broken up while young. After&#xD;
:giving me several hard blows on ea h hand she took&#xD;
the tips of my fingers and knuckle s, and pounded&#xD;
them till, I suppose she was tired. I did not cry after&#xD;
the few first blows, for all at once 1 felling of indig-&#xD;
mation at my ill treatment came ovar me. I felt de-&#xD;
termined not to please them by giving way in their&#xD;
presence, to the anguish they had  aused me; so I&#xD;
whispered to myself, "Violet, be firm. Don't show&#xD;
any weakness now." Therefore, f r n y obstinacy,&#xD;
she said, she whipped me harder th n he otherwise&#xD;
would have done. My hands puffe up immediately&#xD;
like a large pincushion. I thought s ie looked at&#xD;
them rather regretfully, as I held  he  toward the&#xD;
light for a close inspection.&#xD;
I was compelled to stand up the :em inder of the&#xD;

&#xD;
53&#xD;
&#xD;
school. hours; and' after the dismissal Miss Freeman&#xD;
remained with me, talking 'very sternly, and waiting&#xD;
for my petition for forgiveness. But I was not guilty&#xD;
and could not confess what I had not done. My&#xD;
mother had implanted in me too strong a regardfor&#xD;
.truth, even though I be threatened with punishment.&#xD;
I remember once of yielding through fear; but the,&#xD;
compunctions I felt afterward could not be described;&#xD;
and I am determined nothing shall make me swerve&#xD;
from the truth whatever punishment I have to suffer.&#xD;
I told her respectfully I had nothing to confess.&#xD;
Seeing she could not move me she left me in solitude&#xD;
to commune with my wicked, ungrateful heart, she&#xD;
said. She hoped and prayed that God would soften&#xD;
me, and recommending me to the Throne of Grace&#xD;
locked me up alone. How quiet it seemed in that&#xD;
large school room, with io other sound save the buz-&#xD;
zing of the flies, and the beating of my own wild&#xD;
heart, which was so loud it seemed as if it must .be&#xD;
heard in the street. I did not feel at all like a culprit&#xD;
as I sat probing my heart, but like a poor prisoner&#xD;
unjustly accused and no hope of redress. My resent-&#xD;
ment and sense of injuries softened into pity-for Miss&#xD;
Freeman, that she should be so blind in her partiality;,&#xD;
so mistaken in her judgment.. And for Mary Hart I&#xD;
truly grieved. How could she be so cruel!- Then&#xD;
my tears flowed freely! I was so wounded-wounded&#xD;
almost to death; I sought the Throne of Grace then,&#xD;
but with far different motives from what my punisher&#xD;
expected.&#xD;
It was quite dark when Miss Freeman unlocked the&#xD;
door. She called me toward her, and asked me if I&#xD;

had anything to say. I told her no I ad not. She&#xD;
then gave me a note, requesting me to ive it to my&#xD;
father. I promised her I would, and ten ran home&#xD;
as fast as possible; for I was afraid to be out so late,&#xD;
so far from home, and alone.&#xD;
When I entered the house, I foun the family with&#xD;
some company, seated at the supper table. Father,&#xD;
on seeing me, asked me what had detained me so late;&#xD;
I made no answer but handed him th note, then hung&#xD;
my.things up, and with a chokin  heart and sick&#xD;
feverish body went to bed. There I lay trembling&#xD;
alone, in this, my first great sorrow. ;It seemed as if&#xD;
I would grow wild with thoughts of tlhe deep dis&#xD;
grace, and.cruel unmerited punishment. That thought&#xD;
for awhile after I laid my head  pon my pillow,&#xD;
crushed out every other.  Who co ld paint my an=&#xD;
guish?  One minute my heart tos ing madly with&#xD;
hatred, bitter and burning, toward the parties, the&#xD;
next, completely broken down with grief.&#xD;
"How cai I bear it ?" I would shriek; " How can&#xD;
I bear it ?" and then, in a state of frenzy, I leaped&#xD;
from my bed, and wildly paced the room. I had lost&#xD;
entire control, and was crying most bitterly when&#xD;
mother entered the room and open wide her loving&#xD;
arms to me. I rushed to them and obed, and sob-&#xD;
'bed, until it seemed as if I must die.&#xD;
Mother did not say anything to  e1hen, but only&#xD;
stroked my head and whispered: "'ush, hush, my&#xD;
dearr: does not my daughter know where to cast her&#xD;
troubles ? A parent's ear is ever ready. A mother's&#xD;
Tiove shall shield her; and a kind Father in heaven&#xD;

and give her comfort. Tell me then, my daughter,&#xD;

" Oh ! mother ! I did not do it !" I burst out. "I&#xD;
did not do it ! God help me indeed, I did not do it!"&#xD;
then wept with more violence than before.&#xD;
When my tears subsided I related to her the whole&#xD;
facts of the day's occurrence, and implored her to go&#xD;
to the scholars for the truth. I gave her the names;.&#xD;
and then implored her to tell Miss Manton not to be-&#xD;
lieve it.&#xD;
After giving me the promise, she bound up my&#xD;
stiff, and swollen hands, bathed my aching head in ice&#xD;
water, uttered a most heartful prayer by my bedside,&#xD;
kissed me, and told me to compose myself for sleep.&#xD;
0 my good, tender mother ! what a calm pleasant&#xD;
quiet she left upon me, with her blessed good night !&#xD;
How I bless her! 0, she is an angel by my side . IL&#xD;
could not sleep but lay in great pain. Mother had&#xD;
left me but a little while when good old Miss Martin&#xD;
came in to whisper pleasant little words oof consola-&#xD;
tion, bringing with her some warm drink., Dear old&#xD;
lady ! how warmly my heart goes out toward her.&#xD;

A', TRUE STORY.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER        VI.&#xD;
I have been very ill; am just getting up. My jour-&#xD;
nal has been neglected for a long time; it seems to&#xD;
me an age since I took up my pen. I now hasten to-&#xD;
ward it as I would to a dear friend, just as my teacher&#xD;
told me I would. For the past three weeks I have&#xD;
written a very little each day. I am gaining my&#xD;
strength very fast. The past seems like a sad dark&#xD;
dream. I try to forget; but it is impossible to throw&#xD;
it by.&#xD;
Mother says, after they left me that sad night, she&#xD;
was roused by a great noise. She followed it to my&#xD;
room, and found me so ill with the croup I could&#xD;
scarcely breathe. They immediately sent for a phy-&#xD;
sician near by and saved my life. I was also threat-&#xD;
ened with brain fever. The skin is peeling from my&#xD;
face and hands; and my hair is cut vei-y close to my&#xD;
head. Poor Bridget wept and wrung her hands,&#xD;
when she thought her dear Violet would die; she is&#xD;
very attentive to me, surprising me often with some&#xD;
tempting delicacy.&#xD;
Miss Manton has been to see me. The case has&#xD;
been examined into. Mary.Hart was expelled from&#xD;
school, because she would not acknowledge she had&#xD;
done wrong ; Miss Freenian felt so badly about the&#xD;
affair she has left for a distant city. She has obtained&#xD;
a situation as Governess in a private family, I, hear.&#xD;
Having the croup, makes me think of a time when&#xD;
I was quite a little girl,&#xD;
&#xD;
It was in the winter time, when the snow covered&#xD;
the ground many inches. I was heedless and daring,&#xD;
as I am now, and like most children, very fond of&#xD;
the snow. Often at night when returning from school,&#xD;
we would loiter on our way, (I don't do much better&#xD;
now, sometimes,) and jumped into all the banks we&#xD;
could find. At times we would lie in it long enough&#xD;
to impress our forms; then we would print our din-&#xD;
ner baskets, measure our feet, or try to make houses&#xD;
of it. Sometimes, with the help of brother William,&#xD;
w  constructed a fort, with a snow man as sentinel.&#xD;
There was a field in which we would stop often, and&#xD;
where snow would lie in abundance.&#xD;
One morning when I started for school, I was, suf-&#xD;
fering with quite a severe headache and sore throat.&#xD;
I was unable to study all that day, and was glad&#xD;
enough when our teacher dismissed us.&#xD;
The snow lay in high, white, tempting banks, on&#xD;
either side of the street, and to pass it without put-&#xD;
ting our hands in it, seemed, as I oft n think now,&#xD;
too great a temptation for human natur to resist. I&#xD;
suppose I ought to have played blind, until I reached&#xD;
home; but that was almost impossible. I was com-&#xD;
pletely fascinated with the beauty. "How much I&#xD;
have to work with here," thought I, "and it is so&#xD;
light. The sun has shone upon it, just enough to&#xD;
render it pliable, without marring or melting it. It&#xD;
is undisturbed by a single foot-print."&#xD;
While I was looking, thinking and admiring it, 'ere&#xD;
I was aware, forgetful of mother's command and my&#xD;
illness, I was hard at work, building a house to sur-&#xD;
prise the school girls with oi the morrow. All at&#xD;

A TRUE STORY.               59&#xD;
&#xD;
once the approaching darkness reminded me of the&#xD;
wrong I was committing by disobedience. I hurried&#xD;
home, and met my mother at the door, anxiously&#xD;
looking for me. When I spoke to her my voice was&#xD;
very hoarse. Mother looked very sad as she handed&#xD;
me some warm drink, telling me I had given her niuch&#xD;
trouble and sorrow, and that she would have to pun-&#xD;
ish me by sending me to bed supperless. She knelt&#xD;
by my bedside and prayed that God v+uld forgive&#xD;
her little girl for her sinful disobedience.  I could not&#xD;
rest until I had asked her to overlook it, and the tears&#xD;
would keep coming all the time I was repeating my&#xD;
prayers.  In the meantime my cold grew rapidly&#xD;
worse. I suppose I had slept only a short time when&#xD;
I was awakened with a sense of suffocation. I could&#xD;
scarcely breathe, and felt entirely unable to call&#xD;
mother; but-she heard my loud breathing and put&#xD;
me immediately in a hot bath, with wet towels around&#xD;
.my throat, at the same time giving me some medicine.&#xD;
Before the physician arrived I was considered some-&#xD;
what out of danger.&#xD;
The following morning the Doctor called to see&#xD;
me, he took a chair with a grave "ahem "-seated&#xD;
himself, felt my pulse, looked very thoughtful for a&#xD;
half minute, then said in cheerful but subdued tones,&#xD;
"Well, how does.my little daughter do to-day ?"&#xD;
I was forced to make great effort even to whisper,&#xD;
but I answered,'"Pretty well I thank y u; how do&#xD;
you do ?"&#xD;
"You are, hey?" and he burst in a  iolent fit of&#xD;
laughter, as he repeated my words, "Pretty well I&#xD;
thank-you."  This is pretty well indeed, so sick you&#xD;
&#xD;
can hardly speak, and a high fever to boot !"&#xD;
Since then, whenever he meets me, I am sure to be&#xD;
hailed with,-"pretty well, I thank you; how do you&#xD;
do ?" I met him not long ago, as he was walking&#xD;
with a gentleman. He called out to me as I passed,&#xD;
and told him of the circumstance.&#xD;
Mother obliges me to walk every morning. I met&#xD;
the'Doctor yesterday, who said, "that is right; your&#xD;
mother knows what is good for you. I well remem-&#xD;
ber when you all had the whooping cough, your&#xD;
mother had you out in the sun and air daily, and you&#xD;
were often choking and coughing in the street;,but&#xD;
it did you no harm, for you improved faster than any&#xD;
little girls I knew of."&#xD;
While I was getting well, then, father presented&#xD;
me with a lovely wax doll, and my school teacher's&#xD;
daughter kindly offered to dress it f r me. My good,&#xD;
dear father, gave me also, a cradle, and a little wooden&#xD;
house big enough to put the baby ia, and adorned it&#xD;
with furniture of his own making. My baby house&#xD;
was in the garret. As the bed-clothes were not com-&#xD;
pleted, I laid her at night in the cradle bed, with but&#xD;
very slight covering. One morning as usual, I made&#xD;
my visit and was lifting her up to Ombrace her with&#xD;
a kiss, 4s was customary, when, to my great surprise,&#xD;
I found she was headless, and her little hands and&#xD;
one of her feet were completely gnawed off. I took&#xD;
up her head to see if it could be replaced; but the&#xD;
sweet blie eyes in which I loved so well to look, hung&#xD;
drooping from the sockets, and one of the ripe-red&#xD;
cheeks was bitten into, taking part of the mouth that'&#xD;
never did anything but smile. The mice had been there.&#xD;

Carrie and Susie came home last night, crying bit-&#xD;
terly. There are two girls several years older than&#xD;
they, living in the-street where their school is situa-&#xD;
ted, who molest them-when I fail to accompany them;&#xD;
lying in wait, daily, to torment and abuse them. The&#xD;
children usually carry their dinners if it is cloudy&#xD;
weather, and mother is sure to put up some tempting&#xD;
thing, rarely failing to give them apples.&#xD;
For a long time Susie has said, wheni she returned&#xD;
at night, she was so hungry she could ardly wait for&#xD;
the supper bell. Last night she made ome such ex-&#xD;
clamation, and looked as if she had be  crying quite&#xD;
hard, when mother said:&#xD;
"How is it you are so hungry? I gave you a good&#xD;
full dinner, enough I am sure !"&#xD;
As mother questioned them, they i$eth burst into&#xD;
tears; and when she insisted upon   explanation,&#xD;
they wept violently.&#xD;
Carrie said, "Mother, we, cannot tell you, for we&#xD;
promised not to ;" but mother said  "it is a bad&#xD;
promise. You have no right to bind yourself not to&#xD;
tell your mother,, whatever happens."&#xD;
Susie then brightened up, saying-K FI'l- te 1 you&#xD;
mother. Some girls took it away front us before we&#xD;
reached the school-house.T&#xD;
Mother insisted upon knowing more bout it when&#xD;
Carrie made a clean heart of it, and said&#xD;
"Why, mother, they take it from us very time we&#xD;
carry it; and then they frighten ids, and whip us if&#xD;
we refuse. I told them this morning we want d our&#xD;
dinner more then ever, for you, know tl ere wer: some&#xD;

t en they took Susie by the hand to a stable close by&#xD;
their house, and told us. they. were going to put her&#xD;
under, the horses' feet, and let them trample her to&#xD;
death. Susie trembled and cried so I was alarmed,&#xD;
ang gave up our dinner; and mother, I know they&#xD;
wo uild have done it if I had not given it to them.&#xD;
Then they made is promise we would not tell, saying&#xD;
if they knew of our telling anybody of it, they would&#xD;
put us in the chimney-sweep's bag, and they would&#xD;
'arry us home, and give us mouldy bread to eat and&#xD;
ad water to drink, and make us sleep on a bed of,&#xD;
pins and needles; or they would kill us, and p t us&#xD;
:a hole in their cellar, where no one could find us."&#xD;
SFather said it should not be suffered another day.&#xD;
He is going to complain to their parents.&#xD;
Yesterday afternoon we had two little girl's visiting&#xD;
us from the country. About three o'clock mother&#xD;
told me it was time I took my walk, and as the chil-&#xD;
qren remained at-home from schqol they, with my&#xD;
little visitors, accompanied me.&#xD;
We-were enjoying ourselves very much; when we&#xD;
were about to turn a corner of a street we met a chim-&#xD;
ney sweep, face to face; as soon as Susie saw him,&#xD;
she cried out in great terror, "Take me home, Violet,&#xD;
take me home, I'm afraid of that man !"&#xD;
She trembled so.she could scarcely speak, and hid&#xD;
her face in my shawl. I told her the man did not&#xD;
want her, that he was good to little children, if hiss&#xD;
face was black, and he was not looking at her. I told&#xD;
her to look and see that there was no more room in,&#xD;
their bags for her, or any one; for they were full of~&#xD;

We were walking along leisurely, when we m&#xD;
or three cows.&#xD;
"Look at those cows, Violet," said  arrie;&#xD;
you afraid?"&#xD;
I said, "No!"' though I was a little; for w&#xD;
was a very small girl I saw a boy tossed up in ti&#xD;
and injured very much. After that I'was chas&#xD;
the same one ; and since then I have great fear, ti&#xD;
I am loth to acknowledge it.&#xD;
" 0 don't pass them, Violet !" Carrie plead.&#xD;
"0 , they won't hurt us, Carrie ;" said I, tryi&#xD;
be very brave, with my heart almost into my m&#xD;
" I will tell you what to do," said Susie. "1&#xD;

There has been considerable excit&#xD;
sometime past. The "French ship-of-i&#xD;

and the sights and doings are gloriou&#xD;
Such wonderful stories are called from&#xD;
the old people by the appearance of th&#xD;
ing old age more talkative even than its&#xD;
eyes to sparkle with the vivacity of y&#xD;
tionary times rise up before them, reg&#xD;
&#xD;
imaginations of us youngsters with their singular ad-&#xD;
ventures, and hair-breadth escapes, their illustrious&#xD;
acquaintances, their sweet monients of pleasure, and&#xD;
their distressing hours of sorrow and misfortune&#xD;
brought on by the cruel war. At times I am just&#xD;
foolish enough to wish I had been a worker and a&#xD;
partaker in those stirring scenes; I do so love excite-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
Father says, if it is pleasant to-morrow, he will give&#xD;
us the desired pleasure. A few of mother's friends&#xD;
will accompany us.&#xD;
We were all ready for our sail at half-past two.--&#xD;
Some of the ladies whb accompanied us were very&#xD;
much afraid of the water. One of them, who delayed&#xD;
getting into the boat until we were all seated, seemed&#xD;
much frightened; and standing with one foot on the&#xD;
wharf and the other in the boat, said, " 0, Mr. Angel,&#xD;
I dar'nt go; I dar'nt go. I'm afraid for my life; We.&#xD;
shall be upset, As sure as you live,"&#xD;
"0 dear; O dear ! said she every time the boat&#xD;
moved, "we are going !( Boatman, don't you think&#xD;
us in danger of striking , rock out there ? What a&#xD;
foolish woman I was, to leave my home and my chil-&#xD;
dren, and peril my life just to gratify my curiosityI!&#xD;
Well, .I shall learn a lesson from this !"&#xD;
We had a very fine sail notwithstanding ; and after&#xD;
a while the lady forgot her fears, related many amus-&#xD;
ing anecdotes, which made us as happy a boatload as&#xD;
can be.&#xD;
When we neared the ship we foun   it crowded&#xD;

asked if I ever saw a sham fight, and did I attend&#xD;
balls, and then presented a ticket for Annie and mIy-&#xD;

We were doomed to meet with another accident&#xD;
before reaching home. It might have been because&#xD;
some of us were so cowardly. We proceeded only&#xD;
a short distance when we lost our rudder. Then&#xD;
you may be sure exclamations of fear from certain&#xD;

rootsand leaves, reduced to such extremities, as to&#xD;
follow the example of' cannibals, as people do some-.&#xD;

be drifted out to sea and be taken up by pirates; pr,&#xD;

Home, home once more! Did n't it seem good?&#xD;
For once my love of adventure wa     completely&#xD;
satisfied. Right glad were we to lie down to sleep&#xD;
that, night. I do not remember of dreaming of our&#xD;
perils; but the first thing I did in the morning was&#xD;
to recount our wonderful adventures and escapes to&#xD;
my teacher and school-mates, who lstened with&#xD;
attention and evident interest. I suppose I enlarged&#xD;
upon my subject slightly, though I did not at the time&#xD;
intend to do so. I must be very careful; for perfect&#xD;
truth is so much better than momentary display.&#xD;
Election week has passed. I was not able to walk&#xD;
with the crowd, and it sorely disappointed me. But&#xD;
I had the comfort of a dear friend's visit. Minnie&#xD;
.May, who attends, the same school with myself came&#xD;
to see me. 0, I do love her ! She is so good. Not&#xD;
many girls would deny themselves, by staying in of&#xD;
an election day, to please a sick gi'l!  Mother&#xD;
thought that I might be injured by the crowd, and&#xD;
so prevailed- upon 'me to remain at home. I was&#xD;
obliged to deny myself from eating cal e or candy;&#xD;
she gave Minnie and the other girl a plentiful&#xD;
supply; however, I had all th oranges I wanted.&#xD;
Somehow I feel more hungry on that day than on&#xD;
any other ; and every body eats then  s though he&#xD;
never saw any food before, and it was his last chance&#xD;
for procuring it. I did not feel so badly this time as&#xD;
I do generally. I suppose it is because I was not&#xD;
allowed to eat much ; 'and then I ge erally get so&#xD;

it. The companies from the Fort, the Flying Artil-&#xD;
lery, and German Band, with one from Providence,&#xD;
and a conipany from Warren, passed the house&#xD;
several times escorting the Governor, who was&#xD;
seated in an open carriage.  He takes his seat on&#xD;
that dhy, as it is called. As they rode past us, the&#xD;
children in the street cheered him. He stood up in&#xD;
his carriage and waved his hat on all sides.&#xD;
I had quite a good-time after all. Election day, in&#xD;
our State, occp1rs on the last Tuesday of May;&#xD;
and we have ou vacation at that time, which makes&#xD;
it very pleasant. Aunt Katy says, "Lection day is&#xD;
the most tiresome one on airth," she does n't see why&#xD;
such a fuss is made about it; and as for the powder-&#xD;
crackers, whistles and jewsharps, she would like to&#xD;
make one large bonfire of them, for they almost&#xD;
crack her ears open with.their noise.&#xD;
Aunt Katy did not like Carrie's correcting her the&#xD;
other dlay, when she asked for one of her "reasons,"&#xD;
which lay in Carrie's hand.&#xD;
"Not reasons,' said Carrie. "You should say,&#xD;
raisins."&#xD;
" Well 'raisin' then," said Aunt Katy, angrily.&#xD;
"When I was young no little gal was allowed toKcor-&#xD;
rect her betters."&#xD;
Election' morning, such a hubbub there is, such&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8306-00000036"/>&#xD;
running to and fro, from one room to another such&#xD;
a looking at our clothes, which are spread upon tie&#xD;
great-chamber bed!  Then we try o   our sho s,&#xD;
which are generally colored, and make comparions&#xD;
with each other. I am almost too old for that now;&#xD;
but I really did so d little less than two years ago. I&#xD;
am right glad to be old enough to select my shoes;&#xD;
for I am heartily tired of red and tea olor; I think&#xD;
violet or black is much prettier for a large girl.&#xD;
The streets are filled with strangers from far and&#xD;
near. A great many men come from t ae cities, who&#xD;
are very respectable and well-behaved then at home;&#xD;
yet when they get to Newport conduct so badly, I&#xD;
should be quite ashamed to recognize them as rela-&#xD;
tives. There is a great deal of intemp rance at such&#xD;
times ; and the young men imbibe qu'' te too freely.&#xD;
They sometimes deck their coats, canes and hat with'&#xD;
remnants of bright-colored velvet rib on, riding or&#xD;
walking, and singing, and hurrahing, through the,&#xD;
streets. Sometimes they stop and kiss the girls who'&#xD;
pass them; then again they will take them up and&#xD;
run with them, which causes some ala m among the&#xD;
fair ones. Father thinks it is hardly sate for us to go&#xD;
without him on the most public streets. When a cara-&#xD;
van of wild animals is here, we have an addi ional&#xD;
pleasure; and usually father takes us t see it.&#xD;
Our parents say that Annie, Carrie nd I m y go&#xD;
into the. country to-morrow and visit Uncle Thomas.'&#xD;
Joy! joy ! joy! won't we have a nice ieme. I wish&#xD;
all of the. family could go with us, then, I think we&#xD;
would have fun, bathing, walking and riding; and&#xD;
father and mother could explain to us vhat we see.&#xD;

A TRU1E STORY.               71&#xD;
&#xD;
Little Ella has returned home delighted with her&#xD;
visit. Mrs. Borden accompanied her; she kept hera&#xD;
ittle longer than she intended doing; but Ella was&#xD;
well co   tented, and Mrs. Borden could not b'ar to&#xD;
dart with her. the said she had been made h ppier&#xD;
)y the visit, and expressed her thanks very warmly.&#xD;
Such a hugging and kissing as we had" then, all&#xD;
ound. Soon Ella paw mother; she rushed to her:&#xD;
nd clug to her neck, crying. "Oh, mamma; dear&#xD;
amma. '&#xD;
This afternoon, Ella, while looking out of the win-&#xD;
ow, kept calling, "God,! God! God !"&#xD;
"Wh Ella!" exclaimed mother, "what do you.&#xD;
ean?"&#xD;
"W h mother, Mr. Rounds is on the top of the&#xD;
use, a d I was only calling him God, because he is&#xD;
near t e sky."&#xD;
Dear lla,Susie and Willie.! how I hate to leave&#xD;
em behind!&#xD;
Here ve are once more in the country. How&#xD;
od it seems to be away from the city smoke, city&#xD;
ells,, City duties, city splendors, city troublesand&#xD;
verty, which are ever staring one in the face!&#xD;
ere is nothing here to meet the eye but what will&#xD;
ue pleasure, and tempt the heart to sing, "God is&#xD;
uod."  ere is no haughty little girl with her cruel&#xD;
rn, or any poor little thing, burdened and made&#xD;
guid ith the summer's heat, pining for a sight of&#xD;
green grass, and woods and flower.. The field;&#xD;

when one is wishing to get a snuff of fhe pine trees.&#xD;
How lovely it is to enjoy such freedom, with no rules&#xD;
to walk by, or talk by. Here we are unfettered by&#xD;
customs of city or town life, with free happy l1earts&#xD;
which are never tired, keeping time to the music of&#xD;
birds, and where we can warble as loud and a mer-&#xD;
rily as we please. We are beginning to tak  full&#xD;
measures of our freedom   without fear of being.&#xD;
reminded: "Hush ! somebody 'll see you," or "Isome&#xD;
-    one will hear you !" With a step as lightsome as&#xD;
these same bounding hearts, with no smoothing of&#xD;
curls, change of dress, or adornment, save a sun-&#xD;
bonnet and cape. When it is very warm, we have&#xD;
often no other covering for the head than nature's&#xD;
own, our long hair sometimes blown out by the wind,&#xD;
as if it were going to make a journey to the clouds,.&#xD;
and then shading our faces as effectually as a veil&#xD;
would ! It is very delightful to roll in among the&#xD;
long grass, eating strawberries or picking daisies.&#xD;
Uncle says I may be as wild as I wish; for they&#xD;
mean to put some color in my cheeks before I reach&#xD;
home.&#xD;
I love you very much, my little Journal! for you&#xD;
keep a great deal of my heart cozied up in your&#xD;
pages; and then you are just like a looking glass,&#xD;
reflecting my image when I look at you. I am much&#xD;
like other little girls and grown people. We all love&#xD;
to look at our own face, even if there are disagree-&#xD;
able spots there. I am continually in hopes of an&#xD;
improvement. Perhaps I shall look more agreeable&#xD;
in a few years. At least the hope is very strong.&#xD;

Hand in hand the Ocean takes them,.&#xD;
Leads them through his coral walls,&#xD;
And the weary wavelets rest them&#xD;

Our uncle's home is situated in a lovely valley, half&#xD;
a mile from the main road, which is skirted with the&#xD;
pleasant shade of the elm and butternut trees, with&#xD;
high wooded hills, green dales, and singing brooks&#xD;
on either side. Half a mile away in the opposite&#xD;
direction is the shore. From the hills we can very&#xD;
plainly distinguish the Atlantic waters washing&#xD;
gently up the side of the rocks. The pretty lambs are&#xD;
skipping in the open fields, the sleek cattle browsing&#xD;
quietly, or drowsing lazily in the sun. Sometimes&#xD;
the turkey and the little chickens and ducks scamper&#xD;
between the legs of a brood of pigs, who are enjoy-&#xD;

orchards, the gardens, the fields of wheat, the long&#xD;

September. It did seem very good to see my parents&#xD;
and all, once more. We have enjoyed ourselves&#xD;
much; yet, there has been a want in our hearts, for&#xD;
so many of our loved ones were absent, and could not&#xD;
partake of our happiness. I never saw any children,&#xD;
so delighted with their freedom as Ella and Susie.&#xD;
They skip and leap, just like the little pet .lamb Uncle&#xD;
gave to Ella. It's a dear little thing, and already fol-&#xD;
lows their steps wherever they go, rolling with them&#xD;
down the grassy banks, or, when tired lying on their&#xD;
laps like a little kitten. sometimes she will go to&#xD;
sleep so; and when night comes on she will come at&#xD;
their call, and lie down quietly on the soft bed of hay&#xD;
Uncle fixed for her in one corner of the barn. It is&#xD;
really a pretty picture to see Susie bending forward,&#xD;
feeding her, and Ella kneeling on the grass, with one&#xD;
fat arm laid over the curly neck, and in her hand a&#xD;
bunch of clover blossoms, which the lamb regards&#xD;
with sleepy eyes, making a feint of nibbling, more&#xD;
from love of the dear little hand than from any sense&#xD;
of appetite.&#xD;
Yesterday afternoon we went berrying in the woods;&#xD;
and a nice time we had of it. We set off very early&#xD;
in the morning, taking our luncheon with us.. The&#xD;
older people rode in the family carriage, while we,&#xD;
children, in company with. two or three of the neigh..&#xD;
bor's girls, whom Aunt invited to go with us, rode off&#xD;
in fine style' upon a load of hay, which was on its way&#xD;
to a neighboring town. We' were a right merry party,&#xD;
and enjoyed ourselves finel , telling riddles and puz-&#xD;
zles, and singing. It soon c me to my turn for a song;&#xD;

! ha! ha! Vio., could'nt you do better than&#xD;
said Uncle. "Never mind, Pride will have a&#xD;

ever sailed off in such good care, and such style be-&#xD;

but very kindly placed his coat over the General's&#xD;
shoulders to protect him from the cold. Father says.&#xD;
the night was favorable for the capture, that the moon&#xD;
had refused to shine, and the smiling stars knew when&#xD;
to hide their light.&#xD;
We return home to-morrow, with a feeling of quiet,&#xD;
grateful joy... Every thing which could add to our&#xD;
happiness, has been done, and now, with bright eyes;&#xD;
plump cheeks and arms, and hearts beating healthily,&#xD;
after an absence of nearly three months, we meet our&#xD;
dear, dear friends. Now that we are going, it seems&#xD;
as if I could not wait to see my dear Grandma, Miss&#xD;
Manton and my own Minnie May. I do love the&#xD;
country and its simple enjoyments. It is so delight-&#xD;
ful of a warm summer day, to lie and dream in the,&#xD;
shade of' a broad-winged elm, with the head resting&#xD;
on a soft green knoll. Then the happy shouts of&#xD;
laughter, the ringing chorus of glad voices echoing&#xD;
over the hills, which one cannot hear without catch-&#xD;
ing the spirit ; the loud caroling of birds, the hum&#xD;
of insects, and the frolicing of the berry parties, the&#xD;
picnics, the planting, sailing bathing, walking, and&#xD;
baying are all charming in their way. In the Fall of&#xD;
the year they have apple gatherings parties, huskings,&#xD;
paring bees, and many other simple pleasures. What&#xD;
I like is, everything is so hearty and full of life in the:&#xD;
'country. Oh ! these are golden days. Dear old Un.&#xD;

banks, many kinds of owers have been set out, and&#xD;
the yard is neatly gr4velled.  Miss Manton has re-&#xD;
ceived, during my abs nce, a number of new pupils;&#xD;
the school has resu red the same order which was&#xD;
preserved previous to Miss Freeman's care. Miss&#xD;
Manton carries round with her in her example, so&#xD;
much of the principle of love, both in her heart and&#xD;
manner, that few can be insensible to its influence.&#xD;
Minnie May occupies the seat with me, this term.&#xD;
On my return from school, last evening, I met my&#xD;
dear mother passing out.of the hall, bearing a pitcher&#xD;
of water in her hand, and looking very anxious.&#xD;
"Violet," said she, "I wish you would open the door&#xD;
for me, and be ver quiet about it, for Susie is ill.&#xD;
You must not co e in now, for the doctor is with&#xD;
her. Take good c re of Ella, and amuse her all you&#xD;
can, I will let you know how she is soon," she an-&#xD;
swered to my many inquiries.&#xD;
It was with sad misgivings, and a burdened heart that&#xD;
I went to Ella, who was sitting ;on the, door-sill, with&#xD;
her head resting on her hand. She looked up as she&#xD;
heard my footsteps, and putting her little arms out&#xD;
to me, cried: "Sister Vio, take me up to Susie; Susie&#xD;
is sick; Ella must see dear little sister.".&#xD;
It was very difficult to pacify her; and every-now&#xD;
and then, she would plead most piteously to see Su-&#xD;
sie. They are very fond of each other, rarely caring&#xD;
for other playmates ; and Susie has felt great pride&#xD;
when allowed the privilege of' leading Ella down to&#xD;
Mrs. Borden's. I did all I could to console her; so&#xD;
at last had recourse to story telling. As sheasked&#xD;
me for a true one, I told her lof&#xD;

THE CAKE.&#xD;
hen sister Carrie and I were very'litle girls,&#xD;
ie,' who had remained at home one morning,&#xD;
sted us on the door-step,-with, "Ha! 'lija! Girls,&#xD;
cannot guess what mother has been   oing to-&#xD;
ter puzzling us for some time, she told us mother&#xD;
been baking.cakes.&#xD;
h !" said she, "they look so beautifully, and&#xD;
1 so good," and here she made a motion with her&#xD;
th as if enjoying a taste. "I know where she&#xD;
aid them away, too," she continued, as she held&#xD;
he keys of the preserve closet, jingling them in&#xD;
ears. "Don't you want to see them? I'll give&#xD;
a little peep; but we must be very careful not to&#xD;
rb anything, for mother will find it out as quick&#xD;
y one, if things are moved."&#xD;
Such a good time as I've had this morning&#xD;
ting mother to carry up the'cakes, an-. arrang-&#xD;
he shelves," remarked Annie, as she led the way&#xD;
o the closet.&#xD;
re enough, they did look good; and their&#xD;
cious smell made us almost long for them. We&#xD;
ered there a little while, for mother's preserve-&#xD;
m was asanctuary to us, into which we were not&#xD;
r admitted ; so we made the most of our time by&#xD;
fully examining all the good things there. During'&#xD;
ol hours that afternoon, we thought of nothing&#xD;
the cake ; and the first thing we did when called&#xD;
recitations, was to fail, and be sent back to our&#xD;
s in disgrace- At least, Carrie and I were; for&#xD;

the cake, with the great plums, hid the spelling-lessonr&#xD;
entirely from our minds. At night, previous to retir-&#xD;
ing, we thought we must have one more peep at the&#xD;
cake ; we kept turning it and turning it, moving it&#xD;
on 11 sides. To take one more plum a-piece seemed&#xD;
irr sistible. They would scarcely be missed thought&#xD;
we; for the longer we stayed, the stronger the temp-&#xD;
tation became.&#xD;
' Mother says," interrupted Ella, ",-we should&#xD;
tura, away from any thing we covet belonging to&#xD;
an oher."&#xD;
Yes, little Ella," said I, "if we had oily remem-&#xD;
be 6d what mother had taught us, we should have&#xD;
be n saved much sorrow and wrong. On the follow-&#xD;
in morning, instead of raising our young hearts with&#xD;
gr teful praise, to the kind good Father who watches&#xD;
ov r us, our thoughts were entirely occupied with&#xD;
th cake. Another cautious peep was had and a few&#xD;
more raisins were taken. When we had fairly set in,&#xD;
it vas not long before the cake was entirely covered,&#xD;
w'th holes. It was no hard matter after that morn-&#xD;
in 's naughty work, to take each a small piece from&#xD;
d y to day,.until we had eaten it half up.&#xD;
One Friday morning, mother met us in the hall, as&#xD;
w  were hanging up our, bonnets, and said, in her&#xD;
u ually calm tones:&#xD;
"Children, I want you to assist me in washing th4&#xD;
d shes this noon, for Bridget has a great deal to do &#xD;
i the kitchen, and I expect a few friends to tea. I&#xD;
ant you to return home as soon as scl ool is over,&#xD;

there until I come for you."'&#xD;

W  did not linger one minute after dismissal, but&#xD;
;h considerable haste repaired to our chamber,&#xD;
e e we sat down, wondering why she expressed&#xD;
h a desire.&#xD;
hat can be the reason ?" said Carrie. "Perhaps&#xD;
fishes to tell us what we had better put on;- or&#xD;
n y be, she intends to introduce us herself to the&#xD;
nany."&#xD;
f that is it," I answered, "I don't see why she&#xD;
n'res us to sit here so long."&#xD;
ark !" said Annie, as she put her finger to her&#xD;
' they're eating supper."&#xD;
d sure enough, the rattle of knives and forks,&#xD;
ups and saucers, was distinctly heard with the&#xD;
urmur of voices!&#xD;
1 at o ce, I met Annie's glance. I saw she was&#xD;
ing o what I was-the CAKE.&#xD;
o yo think mother knows of it ?" said I, as my&#xD;
flushed with guilt.&#xD;
ow could she help it," said Annie, "when she&#xD;
e table ?" There was no use in saying any&#xD;
We were not to be envied, I assure you. It&#xD;
ed as if the thumping of our hearts, could almost&#xD;
ard down stairs, they beat so loudly.&#xD;
etty s on, mother entered the room. "Children,"&#xD;
she, " here is some cake which I will divide&#xD;
g yo ."&#xD;
ver did cake choke so before. It seemed as'&#xD;
gh I could scarcely swallow it. After we had&#xD;
 it, mother seated herself by us, and commenced&#xD;
ng. She said she was much grieved, that we&#xD;
ld wilfully disobey her; she had hoped she could&#xD;

place more confidence in us, but that we should steal&#xD;
from  her, or any one, was to  er a most painful&#xD;
thought. She said, great as was er disappointment&#xD;
to find her best cake intruded upon; yet, the idea&#xD;
that her little girls should commit such a. sin, was the&#xD;
chief cause of her unhappiness. Ehe then requested&#xD;
us to kneel, while she implored God's forgiveness for&#xD;
our past wrong.&#xD;
Mother's prayer was very affecting. The ,teder-&#xD;
ness with which she spoke of us, and the way she&#xD;
plead, melted our hearts into ,incere repentance.&#xD;
She then said she had a painful duty to perform,&#xD;
which was to punish us, after which we must undress&#xD;
immediately for bed, and lie without speaking one to&#xD;
another, that night. It seemed as if I could never&#xD;
get to sleep for sobbing; and after the company had&#xD;
gone, we could not rest until we had obtained moth-&#xD;
er's forgiveness.             I&#xD;
For a long time, whenever I saw any cake, I felt'&#xD;
the condemnation of the past. I could never forget&#xD;
it.&#xD;
We were: short-sighted children not to have known&#xD;
we should: be found out.&#xD;

tried to comfort us, children, by telling us that&#xD;

when dear father and- mother pa&#xD;

&#xD;
On the hill-top where the light plays&#xD;
Unrestrained and free:&#xD;
Where glad nature's slightest breath is&#xD;

Lay her frail form carefully&#xD;

To-morrow we are all invited to our grandmother's&#xD;
home. We have permission to take Minniel May with&#xD;
us. If there is one place on earth I love to visit it&#xD;
is there. Every thing which can increase our pleas-&#xD;
ures is la d before us, and then grandmother is sure&#xD;
to have   pleasant surprise, some delicate morsel laid&#xD;
by for us to eat; but to my mind there is nothing&#xD;
like a p ece of her cold "johnny cake," buttered&#xD;
nicely, o a piece of her seed-gingerbread. Simple&#xD;
things, but so good when she makes them.&#xD;
.Nice times we have had with her parrot.       Polly&#xD;
has often delighted us with her chatter.    Whenever&#xD;
she was ungry she would call out, "Katie, Katie,&#xD;
poor Poll half starved to death ! Polly 'll starve to&#xD;
death an    die."   Often when    she perceived one&#xD;
whispering, she would sing out, "Polly won't tell !"&#xD;
When we are crying, laughing or singing, she would&#xD;
mimic us to perfection.&#xD;
I remember one time when Carrie was asking&#xD;
father's permission to ride with him, Polly sang out,&#xD;

with thick grey hair, brushed up from a full broad&#xD;
forehead,I bearing on his face the most benevolent&#xD;
expression, and the sweetest smile I ever saw. He',&#xD;
too, love little children, and in that respect he makes&#xD;
me think of our own kear minister; only our's is so&#xD;
much the older man, very serious in manner,. very in-&#xD;
firm, and said to be quite near the grave.&#xD;
Mr.     , of the   -. Church, frequently invites&#xD;
his singirig class to hi house, where, in his spacious&#xD;
yard, they make themselves very merry.&#xD;
I. passed an evening there, not long since, in&#xD;
company with Minnie, and was introduced to his&#xD;
daughter, whois but one year younger than our-&#xD;
selves. She is a very pleasant-spoken, lively, good.&#xD;
hearted girl. If her father does not leave here, she&#xD;
will soon attend school.&#xD;
After tiring ourselves with the play of "Fox and&#xD;
Geese," and "Hunt the Slipper," Mr.  , who joined&#xD;
us in our sport, proposed the game of backgammon.&#xD;
We closed the evening with singing, his eldest&#xD;
daughter, who .is a fine musician, presided at the&#xD;
piang.&#xD;
The time passed delightfully. He spoke with us&#xD;
on the subject of religion; and presented it in such&#xD;
a lovely light we felt strong desires to be after God's&#xD;
own heart..    spoke of God's claiming oir love, of&#xD;
His affection for His children, of the kindnessew&#xD;
bestowed upon us, of the great proofs of His care-..&#xD;
surrounding us, and' the happiness: we would receive,&#xD;
in striving to follow out His laws, physically, morally&#xD;
and spiritually.&#xD;
He Wished us, while our hearts were young and&#xD;

hope, to secure Christ's precious counsel, and v&#xD;
gladly His sustaining presence to our hearts.&#xD;
"Life," he said, " brings many dark shadows&#xD;
times they are very heavy, the grave mantle of&#xD;
frequently hides all the .sunshine; even the&#xD;
not seem to glimmer out upon our toilsom&#xD;
while our crosses are numerous, and difficult&#xD;
Do you not want an unfailing friend to jou&#xD;
your side? Do you not wish His cheering&#xD;
fall upon you, to strengthen and gladden you&#xD;
Do you ngt wish to pursue that course o&#xD;
which will bring around you the holiest and&#xD;
of His angels ? for a true life bring with it&#xD;

It is a rainy day, a:d I have been very busy in&#xD;
looking over the contents of my writing desk. I find&#xD;
there many things to remind me of love. In one box&#xD;
I have several miniatures. I have one of a dear&#xD;
grandfather, who bears an unusually kind face. He&#xD;
has fine dark eyes, brown hair, which is powdered,&#xD;
according to custom in those days, parted in the mid-&#xD;
dle, falling to his shou ders, and tied in a cue. He&#xD;
has a mouth which lcoks as if it was meant only&#xD;
for pleasant words, yet exhibiting sufficient firmness&#xD;
to give it character. Rie wears a drab dark velvet&#xD;
coat with large button , a straw-colored embroidered&#xD;
satin vest. and ruffled shirt, with his drab breeches&#xD;
fastened on the knees with silver buckles. I never&#xD;
had th pleasure of seeing him, for he died when&#xD;
mother vas very young, but I love most dearly to&#xD;
gaze upon, his face. Among my miniatures I have&#xD;
sweet child faces, and cne of a dear friend now very&#xD;
near death. In. anoth-i- box, I have quite a number&#xD;
of ringlets, light and dark, and plain locks of hair, all&#xD;
bearing their seperate names, severed from the heads&#xD;
of persons who are very dear, I have beautiful,&#xD;
choice minerals, giver me by different ones, each&#xD;
giver seemingly anxio s to cultivate my love for the&#xD;
beautiful, pressed flo ers arranged by dear hands,&#xD;
made delicate and trer ulous by sickness and grief.&#xD;
I have many other m mentos of friendship, such as&#xD;

What is the need of binding one's self to certain&#xD;
rules upon which to base' our opinions? All cannot&#xD;
think alike. There's Minnie May who agrees with me&#xD;
generally in sentiment, but in religious matters our&#xD;
ideas differ widely. We view things from our own&#xD;
point of observation, our own individijial perception.&#xD;
Our education has been different, the circumstances&#xD;
by which we have been surrounded differ, the differ-&#xD;
ent medium of mind which receives our thought, com-&#xD;
pels that thought, to take an opposite color. It seems&#xD;
to me God would have formed us more alike if He&#xD;
had intended us not to vary; and if we all wish to&#xD;
serve Him, what matter for these slight differences of&#xD;
opinion? We can walk in the same baths even if we&#xD;
do not resemble each other; we can unite in pleasant&#xD;
converse, and meet at the same point, though we take&#xD;
different roads.&#xD;

on the grassy bank, in the Mill, or on&#xD;

feet making a circuit in the.air nearly over my head,&#xD;
and his clenched hand quite touching my shoulder.&#xD;
He would notice my frightened face, and bowing very&#xD;
low would say with a pleasant smile spinning out&#xD;
from his eyes-" Oh, my little dear, I would not&#xD;
frighten you for anything !"&#xD;
At times he would alarm us considerably, by sud-&#xD;
denly and quickly turning somerset in our path, bow=&#xD;
ing almost entirely to the ground. Then in most&#xD;
tragic moods he would throw his hands out violently,&#xD;
and cry in a loud voice-" Make room for the Lepers,&#xD;
atthe same time beckoning the crowd to stand off.&#xD;
Often he would say, "Make room for the children,&#xD;
or, "Here comes the belles of N-," and with an-&#xD;
other form of politeness he bows and dances lightly&#xD;
from our presence.&#xD;
Father came in to-day and laid before sister Annie&#xD;
a piece of calico, of a very pretty, neat figure.&#xD;
"There, Annie," said he, "I have brought this to&#xD;
youl for the purpose of testing your ingenuity. I&#xD;
have heard several complaints lately of your dresses&#xD;
not fitting well, now I want to see what you can do&#xD;
toward cutting and fitting for yourself.'&#xD;
"But, father," interrupted Annie.&#xD;
"Hush," said father, "hear me out. I wish you to&#xD;
try to cut out your dresses\; I will give you all the&#xD;
cloth you will require to learn upon, if a dozen pieces&#xD;
are spoiled by experiment; and you shall have as&#xD;
many new dresses as you have a mind to make. Will&#xD;
you do it ?" he continued, as he playfully patted Annie&#xD;
on one cheek.&#xD;

They said they were getting old, and probably should&#xD;
not live long. Aunt Susie was blind and very feeble,&#xD;
and she united with them in their wishes.&#xD;
"If I had only a housekeeper, now," said mother,&#xD;
"I could go. Bridget needs some one to look after&#xD;
her, and Miss Martin is too old for such a responsi-&#xD;
bility."&#xD;
"0 , do go," plead Annie; "I -can leave school a&#xD;
little time, and take care of the house as nicely as any&#xD;
one. Say, mother, wont you try me ?&#xD;
' And, mother," chimed in Willie, "it is a duty you&#xD;
owe to them. You know Aunt Susie is so chfldish&#xD;
she will take it very much to heart if you don't go.&#xD;
I shall have every Saturday night, and will assist in&#xD;
many duties. Come, mother, you had better conclude&#xD;
to trust us," he said, as he put his arms around her&#xD;
neck.&#xD;
Miss Martin camb in, and wished to know what the&#xD;
conference could be about. Mother then told her.&#xD;
She advised mother to go, by all means, and she said&#xD;
the children would get along nicely.&#xD;
What an exciting time the packing business makes&#xD;
--running here and there, and each one anxious to&#xD;
assist somebody else. "0," thought I, "now I'll&#xD;
have some fun !" I do so love the bustle of I helping&#xD;
any one off. But, no ! If confusion usually atteids&#xD;
such circumstances, in the present instance I was&#xD;
doomed to disappointment; for mother had every-&#xD;
thing done so quietly, you would never have'known&#xD;
she was going away.' Father looked a little anxious.&#xD;
He went round the house several times, to see that&#xD;

everything was safe to leave, and would repeatedly,&#xD;
inquire if we remembered his orders. Then he would-&#xD;
go to the trunks, to see if the lock were secure, or&#xD;
caress Ella for la minute. He would then look out:&#xD;
anxiously fcr the carriage that was to convey them to&#xD;
the boat. In fine, it did seem as i he never kiew,&#xD;
what quiet was. I think after this e must be  ery.&#xD;
careful how he throws stones at hi neighbors. He'&#xD;
must have felt very badly about going so far away&#xD;
from hisfai1ily.&#xD;
" The carriage has come ! Quick, mother, quick !"&#xD;
cried Carrie, in an excited tone, as he lifted up her.&#xD;
head for a kiss.&#xD;
There wdre no tears shed; but I think we all felt&#xD;
very much like it. One thing is certain, the supper&#xD;
was scarcely touched that night..&#xD;
0, how lonely it does seem wit out father Land&#xD;
mother. Ella has scArcely laughed alud since mother&#xD;
left us. Atnt Katie took tea with s last night, nd&#xD;
compliment d us very highly for ou good behavior.&#xD;
She said she could recommend An ie to anybody.&#xD;
She didn't see ag her laming had do e her any har"m.&#xD;

pretty witching way."  She says it's her opinion he&#xD;
is too good for this world.&#xD;
Ella is no) wi ling to go with any one, but Anne ;&#xD;
I suspect she mourns for mother mo e than any one&#xD;

a seminary in    . I sincerely hope slle may meet&#xD;
with kihd friends there, and will acquire the fashion-&#xD;

dear friend, has gone to New York. How very&#xD;
much we do miss her. She writes she is enjoying&#xD;
herself finely, making many new acquaintances,&#xD;
visiting places of amusement, sailing, riding and.&#xD;
walking ; in short, having an excellent time. 0, how&#xD;
long the time seems to wait ! I feel as though I&#xD;
must fly to her.&#xD;
To-morrow there is to be an excursion to Conrad's&#xD;
Cave. The several schools of the town will unite&#xD;
with ours, starting very early and taking their lunch-&#xD;
eon with them. How I would like to go? I-suppose&#xD;
it will not be best when father is absent from home.&#xD;
Next Saturday they will go to the Lily Pond; and&#xD;
every succeeding week, when pleasant, they intend&#xD;
visiting all the places of interest.&#xD;
Yesterday we had quite a jubilee, a Temperance&#xD;
pic-nic. As it was held in our vestry, Miss Martin&#xD;
thought we had better go. Our society is quite'&#xD;
large, composed entirely of children. We had quite&#xD;
an interesting time. After walking vin procession&#xD;
through the principal streets, carrying our appropri-&#xD;
ate banners, with a slight feeling of pride- at the&#xD;
display, we repaired to the Church, where we listen-&#xD;
ed to speeches from several of the ministers, and one&#xD;
or two earnest workers in the Temperance Cause,&#xD;
who discoursed most eloquently of the sorrow and&#xD;
suffering intemperate habits brought upon us. We&#xD;
had a right merry time. I think nothing occured to&#xD;
mar the enjoyment of- any one there.&#xD;

think education unfits us for every duty in life; and.&#xD;
moreover tends to ingratitude for past kindnesses&#xD;

"Violet, do n't you feel a leetie bit ashamed of your&#xD;

into my face. "Do n't you hate to wash dishes with&#xD;

"Oh, bless your dear leetle soul !" said she, draw-&#xD;

done violence to my feelings. "I would n't hurt you&#xD;
for nothing!  You know I love you eenamost to&#xD;
death; and its parfectly nat'rul I should be worried&#xD;
about you."  Here she knocked up a pinch of snuff,&#xD;
had resource to her ample silk handkerchief, and&#xD;
wiped out the corners of her eyes.&#xD;

.after a short pause, "but to sing and play while their&#xD;

CHAPTER X]&#xD;
&#xD;
Snow has come again; how glad an I to welcome&#xD;
it ! It is pleasant to watch it fallin g so gently, so&#xD;
softly and steadily. Ella seems beside herself with&#xD;
delight. She came to my room this morning, waking&#xD;
me up by crying out : "Violet ; oh Violet! do get up&#xD;
and see the snow. Oh, it is so beautiful! so soft and&#xD;
white; just like feathers, or little things alive, and&#xD;
dancing as merry and spry as fairies ! Just look on&#xD;
the ground, too.! Isn't it the sweetest carpet you&#xD;
ever saw? Won't we have fun, snow-balling? There&#xD;
goes a sleigh !  Do look, Violet!   And there 's&#xD;
another!  0, there's the baker's cart on runners !&#xD;
I mean to ask him to give me a ride !"&#xD;
Away she bounded down stairs; and before I could&#xD;
get my dress hooked, she had mounted the seat, and&#xD;
was off. When I went down to breakfast, the first,&#xD;
thing I saw was Ella running up and down the yard&#xD;
with Willie's sled in her hand, and some bells around&#xD;
her neck. She inquired of me if she did not sound&#xD;
just like a sleigh. My heart is so impressed with the&#xD;
beauty of the freshly falling snow, I feel forced to&#xD;
give it utterance.&#xD;

shall do. I was thinking yesterday, mine were out-&#xD;
grown, and quite shabby.&#xD;
Father has been visited by a great number of the&#xD;
Church the past few weeks. They come often to see&#xD;
him, and seem to be in close conversation.  They&#xD;
look quite angry while talking. What can be the&#xD;
reason?&#xD;
I asked mother to-day, what was the trouble now ?&#xD;
She says he is being "churched" for entertaining&#xD;
sentiments differing from their creed ; that father&#xD;
does not believe in close communion; that he thinks&#xD;
it is not right for us to deny the Lord's Supper to&#xD;
any one who sincerely desires it. It has caused quite&#xD;
a difficulty with some of the most rigid members.&#xD;
His teachings are considered by them as injurious to&#xD;
the children. I cannot think so.&#xD;
To-day. when father addressed the Sabbath School,:&#xD;
many of the teachers wept violently ; and when they&#xD;
left, shook hands with him, and plead that he would&#xD;
still remain their superintendent. Father is told by&#xD;
the chief members,. that if he will teach what they,&#xD;
the head, direct; according to their creed, he can&#xD;
remain with them. This quarreling on account of'&#xD;
difference of creed, or opinion,:does not look right.&#xD;
There is a great evil somewhere. I cannot see how&#xD;
father can be prevented from keeping. the school, if.&#xD;
he'i turned away from the Church; for the school&#xD;
was first got up by him, and was sustained mostly at&#xD;
his own expense.&#xD;
Well, it is all over with him now. Father would not&#xD;
consent to teach, otherwise- than from his own&#xD;
convictions of right.. He was not willing to depend.&#xD;
&#xD;
upon another m&#xD;
he has been t&#xD;
Poor father! h&#xD;

ceive things calmly. I fear this affair will spoil me&#xD;
for the church. I have hitherto had such a great&#xD;
veneration for it and all its teachings. I have been&#xD;
rudely awakened from a very pleasant dream, and I&#xD;
look upon tie members now as only men, very com-&#xD;
anon men. Perhaps it is for the best. I had placed&#xD;
them so high in the scale of excellence, the world's&#xD;
amen could not reach them. Since gratitude, love,&#xD;
honor, principle, must be sacrificed on the altar.of in-&#xD;
tolerant bigotry and injustice ; since the Christ is hid-&#xD;
den behind the door of the church, and selfishness is,&#xD;
:set up before the people to worship, I must say my&#xD;
faith is waning, dying all out ; and I. look around in&#xD;
any helplessness, crying, whom now can we trust,&#xD;
.since they, our pillars, have crumbled to the dust?&#xD;
What can we lean upon, what can guide us, since our&#xD;
lights are sunk into darkness ? All for this mistaken&#xD;
sense of Christianity, my dear friends "must be aliens&#xD;
:from home," through this lonely world, groping in&#xD;
their sorrow:! The faith so warm, so rudely broken,&#xD;
scan never be restored. It is right, for it may bring&#xD;
them nearer to the dear Father of all. May od&#xD;
comfort us, for we feel so alone in our woe.&#xD;
Father has not been well for some time. I think&#xD;
this trouble has, preyed upon him. He now seems&#xD;
threatened with fever-billious fever-the doctor&#xD;
says. . Je is very ill.&#xD;
Father's symptoms are worse to-day. The disease&#xD;
is pronounced-small pox, or rather varioloid. How&#xD;
I dislike to write that word.! Of all diseases the&#xD;
most to be dreaded in a family, the mos repulsive.&#xD;

least, my pride was touched rather rudely. It seemed&#xD;
quite a Mortification to be pointed out to the passer&#xD;
by. We all looked quite sober as the stroke of the&#xD;
hammer fell' upon our ears. It was like a death&#xD;
knell to us. Ella seemed delighted, an acted as if it&#xD;
was put up for her especial amusement and laughed'&#xD;
and shouted in high glee.&#xD;
What a long two weeks it has bee  to us-such&#xD;
anxious ones. The Doctor thought we could not es-&#xD;
cape, so he has inoculated us for the disease; but,&#xD;
to i our surprise, it .did" not take. Sine then he has&#xD;
vaccinated us for the kine pox, which was a failure&#xD;
also. He says he will trust us -now all over the&#xD;
world. I wonder much we have not frightened our-&#xD;
selves into the disease so much dreaded, we were so&#xD;
anxious until the first fortnight was up  the slightest&#xD;
pain or pimple seemed to wear a Death's head.&#xD;
0, what a dreary winter it is to us, shut up so&#xD;
closely, scarcely allowed to go out in the yard. Even&#xD;
playing and reading grow stale. I have seemed to&#xD;
lose all interest in my books. I do so pine for the&#xD;
fresh air. An old gentleman passing, saw us running&#xD;
for exercise in the yard, and told us, n a very com-&#xD;
mnanding manner, to keep in the house, or he would&#xD;
complain of us. We obeyed, but very reluctantly. I&#xD;
feel just as if we were prisoners, the e are such re-&#xD;
:strictions placed upon us. Miss Martin is very com-&#xD;
forting ; she says it is not half so bad s it was in old&#xD;

CHAPTER       XII.&#xD;
Father is improving fast. He sat up o-day a short&#xD;
time. If he continues to do so, he wll remove up&#xD;
stairs next week. Doctor says a chang of room will&#xD;
be of benefit to him. Such fun as we have frequently&#xD;
in drawing up provisions in a basket, 'nd, talking to&#xD;
our friends across the street. The only drawback&#xD;
there is, there can be no privacy said, or everybody&#xD;
can hear us. It makes us feel as if w were in jail,&#xD;
and pitying friends were bestowing favors upon us.&#xD;
How amusing it must look to our neighbors.&#xD;
To-day we had a kiss from father, b t a glass door&#xD;
separated us. He does not look very much altered.&#xD;
Such a dust has been raised for a few days! The&#xD;
whole house is open, and we can.drink in all the air&#xD;
we wish. Oh ! how' sweet it does seem. We are&#xD;
having a thorough airing and cleaning  Our carpets,&#xD;
bed and bedding, which father used, were buried sev-&#xD;
eral feet under the earth; but we did ot weep much&#xD;
at the burial. I know they are havin  a sure purifi-&#xD;
cation. Snow, wind, and rain, with ccasional sun-&#xD;
shine, have poured and beat fully upon them.&#xD;
We all went to church to-day, and it afforded us no&#xD;
slight amusement to see how soon we had the side-&#xD;
walk by ourselves ; and those on the_ ther side were&#xD;
afflicted with such a sudden cold in t eir heads, that&#xD;
their handkerchiefs were indispensable. Such a scat-&#xD;
tering as there was when we went up the steps. We&#xD;
found plenty of room to navigate. almost wanted&#xD;

to shout, the "C''mpbells are coming, Oh, ho! Oh,&#xD;
ho!" or the " Lpers." We took our seats in the&#xD;
gallery, but even from that distance there were many&#xD;
who seemed as i they feared they would not reach&#xD;
home alive. Th sermon was not very effectual that&#xD;
day, if we may judge by the timid, glances and restless&#xD;
movements made by the congregation. The text&#xD;
should have been ''"Contagion."&#xD;
To-day we resumed our seats in school. My teach-&#xD;
er seems delighte to see us, but the girls appeared&#xD;
very much alar oed, and even Winnie Wright, I'&#xD;
thought, spoke quite coldly. I put my hand upon my&#xD;
new seat-mate's shoulder to. inquire where the lessons&#xD;
were, when she  oved very quickly away, as far as&#xD;
possible from me, and said, in a tone of indignation;&#xD;
"Whiy, Violet Angell, I should be ashamed to speak&#xD;
to anybody. I mean to tell my mother ! I shouldn't&#xD;
wonder if I had taken the disease ! So she went off&#xD;
pouting, and reported me to Miss Manton, who only&#xD;
smiled in answer.&#xD;
Oh dear, it is trouble again, nothing but trouble,&#xD;
now before us. One misfortune has only opened the&#xD;
way for another. How I wish Minnie would return,&#xD;
I do so wish for some one whom I can trust, to open&#xD;
my heart to. Really, it is becoming very heavy. I&#xD;
try hard to shake off these feelings, and hide them&#xD;
by my usually light, happy exterior; but if' father is&#xD;
unhappy, 'how can I, if I allow myself to have any&#xD;
sympathy, help feeling and suffering with him. -You,&#xD;
dear Journal, have to bear all my burdens upon your&#xD;
white pages. .I wonder if you never weary hearing&#xD;

else? If I do trouble you, you have never revealed&#xD;
it to me; and your covers are ever open like the&#xD;
arms of a loving friend. I do not know what I&#xD;
should do without you, it is so sweet to lay my&#xD;
sorrows here. I feel as though I had thrown half&#xD;
my load away. Since father's recovery, he finds it&#xD;
impossible to collect in his heavy debts. If he only&#xD;
could, we could pay all, without any sacrifice of pro-&#xD;
perty, and still remain comfortable. Business is dull:&#xD;
banks are failing; and father fears he  ill break also.&#xD;
Another little one is added to ourcircle, a dear&#xD;
brother. He has ehone just whonwe feel as if we&#xD;
could not receive him. I feel so sorrowful I do not&#xD;
know how to welcome him with gladness; but Ella,&#xD;
like all little children, is evidently delighted, and is&#xD;
already trying to make herself useful by amusing and&#xD;
holding him. We will try to love our baby stranger,&#xD;
it will not be very hard, and shield hinr all we can by&#xD;
our affection from the heavy clouds surrounding him.&#xD;
He is a darling dark-eyed boy, plump and pretty, with&#xD;
an abundance of straight, dark hair.&#xD;
Mother lies tery low, and is no   expected to&#xD;
recover, The rooms are al darkened; the knocker&#xD;
is idffiled, and we have to walk with a stealthy tread,&#xD;
when engaged with our duties. They told us yester-&#xD;
day we must expect to lose our mother very soon.&#xD;
The thought is too agonizing to bear for a moment.&#xD;
I will not accept the supposition, but wYill inspire her.&#xD;
with all the hope within me, until she is called to&#xD;
lie in the VALLEY OF DEATH. I. feel impressed she is&#xD;
dot to leave us yet. May God grant our prayer !&#xD;
Father has faled, Poor father!  Poor mother V&#xD;
&#xD;
A TRUE STORY.               19.&#xD;
&#xD;
and poor all of us. May we now have assistance&#xD;
from a higher source in this our time of greatest&#xD;
need!&#xD;
Ever thing that can be gathered around our dear&#xD;
home, books, that we value most highly, our few&#xD;
treasures, our comforts, even things that belong to&#xD;
our necessities, are to be put up to the highest&#xD;
bidder.&#xD;
Several' of our friends are angry with father,&#xD;
because he will not transfer his property to them,&#xD;
under cover of their protection, until the affair is&#xD;
hushed up; but father is too strict in his integrity to&#xD;
bow or bend to such temptation.&#xD;
Most of our creditors are very gentlemanly and&#xD;
kind; but a few were so greedy, they hardly wanted&#xD;
us to keep the bare necessities of life. One person&#xD;
even strongly urged taking up the carpet of the&#xD;
room  where mother lay very sick.  I was told,&#xD;
gentleman said to the man, he should walk over his&#xD;
dead body before he would permit him to perpetrate&#xD;
such an outrage.&#xD;
Willie has been obliged by our common misfortune;&#xD;
to leave College. He has procured a situation ii&#xD;
Philadelphia. He will leave home next week for the&#xD;
uncertain comforts of a stranger. Poor boy! What&#xD;
a disappointment is his! For awhile the novelty of&#xD;
his position will occupy his attention. After that has&#xD;
died away, and every thing around him becomes&#xD;
familiar, then how strong will be the yearnings for a&#xD;
mother's soft hand to rest upon his brow with :gentle&#xD;
words, and a fat er's earnest, well-timed, counsel.&#xD;
Perhaps he wouli then quite enjoy a little teazing&#xD;

Sister Annie, as well as myself,&#xD;
annoyed with a little circumstance thi&#xD;

Jane Du Say, a young girl', quite f&#xD;
all, and intimate with sister Annie, cal&#xD;
to going to school, as is usual for her&#xD;
to Annie, "This is tobe my last call,&#xD;
does not"-here she stammered and g&#xD;
"Why not?" asked I, in a hurry to&#xD;
at once.&#xD;
"Well, the truth is, they say you hay&#xD;
poor now, and that I am growing older&#xD;
be admitted into fashionable society if&#xD;
go with you. So they have comman&#xD;
visit you; I feel very sorry, because&#xD;
much, and enjoy coming here. I th&#xD;
tell you of it, so you would not think&#xD;
with you. They wish me to keep com&#xD;

allows her to do just as she wants to&#xD;

lovely times when I go there. Do yo&#xD;

"Yes," answered Annie, very quietly&#xD;
thinks they are rather too rude for&#xD;

the faults of others so easily, and are inclined to be&#xD;
rude also. Kate has called here several times for ,m&#xD;
to walk with her; but father did not think it best for&#xD;
me to go."&#xD;
"How strange !" said Jane, "your father should do&#xD;
so, when they are so wealthy ! She would not come&#xD;
to see you now; for your father's failing makes a&#xD;
great difference to your position in society, especially&#xD;
as you are growing older. You would n't be received&#xD;
any where, and-."&#xD;
"0, as to that," interrupted I, with a slight tone of&#xD;
anger, "we never pretended to ape fashionable&#xD;
society, and never mean to, let our condition be what&#xD;
it mnay. We always intend to cultivate the society of&#xD;
the intelligent, the educated, and the good. Father&#xD;
often says if we were as rich as Croesus, he would&#xD;
rather see us sleeping beside his father in the grave-&#xD;
yard, than following the absurd, life-destroying follies&#xD;
of. the day, crushing all. that is noble out of use and&#xD;
making woman merely a simpering doll-baby.'&#xD;
" Well," said. Jane, laughingly, "you are in for the.&#xD;
big talk, at any rate. I should think you might ghe&#xD;
a lecture to the public, you feel so warmly upon the&#xD;
subject; and I'll get up a subscription for you. It is&#xD;
likely you will find use for it," she continued, with&#xD;
a slight sneer; "however, I have not come to&#xD;
quarrel with yoti.&#xD;
"But Jane," said Annie, who took no notice of the&#xD;
last remark,, so intent was. she upon what was first&#xD;
repeated to her, "I do n't know why property should&#xD;
make any difference. The losing of our comfortabl&amp;amp;&#xD;

Yes, I did forget myself, most sadly.  All my&#xD;

Miss Manton had heard me, she would have whispered&#xD;
in my ear the word "DISCIPLINE." Will the time&#xD;

seen by er sister, who was coming up street, stepped&#xD;
behind he door. This roused all the pride of my&#xD;
nature; and I told her she had better not come again,&#xD;
to go her way, and I would go mine; for after what&#xD;
had bee said, I did not care to renew the acquaint t-&#xD;

a few, who were, left to us, who loved us for our-&#xD;
selves. After she went out, I could not help giving&#xD;
way to tears. I felt a deep regret that I had said so&#xD;
much ;  ut how could I help it? I felt so insulted'&#xD;
No one ikes the idea of being weighed by dollars&#xD;

the contrary, they who have fed at our own table&#xD;

While walking down street this evening I met Su-&#xD;

Being acquainted with both parties, nd forgetting&#xD;
the distinction a few dollars makes in the feeble minds&#xD;

When the heart of such an individual is opened to&#xD;

&#xD;
beautiful bay, and the islands surrounding it. Father&#xD;
and mother look happier than they have for a long&#xD;
time.  They are bearing their troubles bravely.&#xD;
Annie and C'arrie do much toward filling their&#xD;
parents' hearts with life, they ire so joyous. It is&#xD;
beautiful to see them yielding to. their circumstances&#xD;
so cheerfully.  This trouble -has not left a single&#xD;
aibade upon their bronv; they are so different from&#xD;
me. I am so changed. I scarcely realize when it has&#xD;
been effected. 1 only know I am transformed into&#xD;
something seemingly cold and disagreeable, almost&#xD;
stern. Why, it seems as if I can already see deep&#xD;
wrinkles on my forehead.. 0, I feel so old, I think&#xD;
often there is a barrier between me and the rest of-&#xD;
the world. I know I am struggling in my heart&#xD;
against my destiny.  I am not reconciled to my&#xD;
condition. I do not feel as if I was myself. What&#xD;
spell has come to change my very nature?&#xD;
Annie was invited last night to a social gathering;&#xD;
she asked mother f she might go. Mother consent-&#xD;
ed, and said: "But what will you wear?" "Silk of&#xD;
course," said Annie; making a mock courtesy. "But&#xD;
see here, and she held out her new calico dress, as&#xD;
she added, won't t is do ironed out, and with a clean&#xD;
ruffle in the neck. T' will look nicely, won't it&#xD;
mother ?" and she bounded out of the room happy&#xD;
as a singing bird.&#xD;
friends are gathering all around us, tendering their,&#xD;
sympathy and loveL How much good a kind, hopeful'&#xD;
word will do us in our hours of sorrow.&#xD;
Annie came in this morning, exclaiming: " 0&#xD;

for, after my day3 work is done, I take my books&#xD;
out, and study with a good will. At times I am very&#xD;
weary; and it i often difficult to overcome my&#xD;
inclinations, when my energies are exhausted. But&#xD;
what if I am wear , I say to myself, have I not one&#xD;
grand hope, one igh aim, one sure destiny before&#xD;
me? To be sure by this course; it will be a long&#xD;
time before I enjoy a. completion of my hopes; but&#xD;
it would not be right, nor would I be blest, if I were&#xD;
to leave my mother, with her frail strength, and all,&#xD;
the cares that are now devolving upon her, to pursue&#xD;
my. darling plans. No! I must do my duty, even&#xD;
though I fail of ,uccess. But I know I shall not&#xD;
fail ! And then, h ! will we not be happy?&#xD;
Yesterday our city was visited by a violent storm&#xD;
Notwithstanding the warm weather, it hailed violent-&#xD;
ly. The stones ere as large as hen's eggs, and after&#xD;
the storm abated they were gathered up by the bas-,&#xD;
ket full. lany whindows were broken, and fragments&#xD;
of the glass wer flying' everywhere, and, injuring&#xD;
whatever they car e in contact with. The gardens,&#xD;
upon which an our before many were looking with&#xD;
pleasurable pride they had been so lovely, so flour-&#xD;
ishing, and proved such a plentiful supply for the&#xD;
table, were effec wally ruined. The hail storm was&#xD;
succeeded by a r i4, which amounted almost to a del.&#xD;
uge, bringing to my mind very forcibly, pictures of&#xD;
Bible times, whe the world was destroyed by water;&#xD;
but we had no 'k like Noah's wherein we could be&#xD;
saved. By the fo ce of the storm the river was driven&#xD;
high up over the anks, washing away everything that&#xD;
impeded its progess.. But only so far was it allowed&#xD;

ided in the house, Their attention was at&#xD;
cted to a room in the cellar. In a corner&#xD;
de bed, and upon it lay a: widdle-aged man,&#xD;
y ing of consumption. The wife, who was&#xD;
the bed, had nearly stripped herself of suit-&#xD;
hing to protect him, for the water had grad.&#xD;
t up, until it had nearly reached the bed. In&#xD;
Vom, seated on a table by a window, was an&#xD;

side her, while in the centre .of the room&#xD;
boys, with their trousers rolled up, wading&#xD;
ng rafts of the boards and sev ral household&#xD;

on a bundle of rags, with his feet dangling&#xD;

It was a very wretched sight, but they&#xD;
emoved to more comfortable quarters,&#xD;

to which I should be subject.. I have long desired&#xD;
such an opportu ity. Shall I be weak enough to&#xD;
shrink from it for such a foolish cause ? "No," I said&#xD;
to myself. " I wil try to subdue this false shame,;kar&#xD;

completely wretched while laboring under these feel-&#xD;

She plead so l vingly, I immediately burst into&#xD;
tears, the first I ad shed for many long weeks. It&#xD;
seemed as if i1ha forgotten how to cry,-.or that my.&#xD;
heart was harden d too much for tears. As soon as I&#xD;
could control myseif 1 confided to her the exact state&#xD;

A TRUE STORY.              135&#xD;
e house where we go daily is delightfully situ-&#xD;
and very prettily surrounded with shrubbery&#xD;
owners. It is also finely furnished, and singing&#xD;
are making merry through the spacious halls.&#xD;
Taylir, the mistress of the mansion, is a very&#xD;
ant, benevolent lady, with two daughters. One&#xD;
em i about my own age, the other a few years&#xD;
er. Mrs. Taylor is very indulgent to 'us. She&#xD;
will permit us to work until we are fairly rested&#xD;
our walk, and often makes us rest between&#xD;
.  Carrie, through the pleasant influence of&#xD;
T., is very conversable, chatting as'.gaily as&#xD;
h she were at home. To me she says but little,&#xD;
my gly pride comes up to whisper bad things&#xD;
and the condescending manner which I see in&#xD;
of the inmates, renders me unloveable and very&#xD;
t toward them. Mr. T. offered to;take us home&#xD;
carriage, which was standing in the door. Car-&#xD;
cepted the invitation before I could give her a&#xD;
e look, so I consented, in order not .to appear&#xD;
gracious for his well-meant kindness.&#xD;
I was seating myself, his little daughter Lelia&#xD;
d a portion of my dress, and cried with great&#xD;
n, "She shan't ride in my carriage. Stop,&#xD;
T. did not notice her at all, but drove past,&#xD;
them to take her into the house. What a&#xD;
thing that as to render me unhappy, yet it&#xD;
nd it 'was a long time before I could sleep, I&#xD;
t so intently upon it.&#xD;
ay Mrs,. T. had company.to dine with her,&#xD;
I'did not wish nor expect to go down with the&#xD;

family at noon, bu I could not help feeling a little&#xD;
foolish pride, nor peep the choking tears down, as&#xD;
they set my dinner before me upon a waiter. During&#xD;
the afternoon I was rather unamiable ; an old lady, a&#xD;
relative visiting there, who remained at home while&#xD;
the company were riding out, after trying to converse&#xD;
with me, asked m  if I did not wish to examine the&#xD;
house, an invitatio  I had many times declined, for&#xD;
Various reasons. She then opened the reception&#xD;
room, with a mani est pride.&#xD;
"There," said she, " is where they receive the&#xD;
grand company."&#xD;
"Don't they receive any but the rich there ?" asked&#xD;
Carrie.&#xD;
"No, indeed! not the poor folks."&#xD;
There was ano her home thrust to swallow ; but&#xD;
Carrie looked as thoiigh she had not heard it.&#xD;
-' Is it not the sweetest room you ever saw ?" said&#xD;
tshe, turning toward d me.&#xD;
"No." I answered, "I have seen many I like as&#xD;
well, but this is pretty."' I added, a moment after,&#xD;
trying to soften  y answer.&#xD;
We then inspected the grand parlor-bedroom, as&#xD;
she called it, after ,which she opened the spacious&#xD;
drawing-room.&#xD;
" There, did you ever see anything half so beauti-&#xD;
tiful as this ?" and she opened wide the blinds, for us&#xD;
to take a full survey of the really beautiful carpet,&#xD;
and the various curiosities worthy of attention, that&#xD;
adorned the room. "Say, girls, did you ever see&#xD;
anything like it. There are not many people who&#xD;
have got such a fine place as we have I"1&#xD;

our residence, and people from the various&#xD;
hes were hurrying home with affright.    It&#xD;
very rapidly, for the wind was strong and&#xD;
eable, and the fiery serpent wound its crimson&#xD;
everywhere. One minute the flames were clos-&#xD;
arfully around us, the next you would see them&#xD;
in an entirely different direction, darting forth&#xD;
venomous tongues, and with their murky and&#xD;
ble breath clouding the whole heavens. 0, it&#xD;
sickening to see those tasteful homes, reared with&#xD;
ch care, where love and happiness seemed to&#xD;
destroyed by the remorseless fireI And how&#xD;
ful to listen to the cries of distress that were&#xD;
where heard; parents looking for their chil-&#xD;

homes , which they were unable to find amid the&#xD;

A TUE STORY.&#xD;
a close imitation of Ella's own hand-writing, and wrote&#xD;
Ella's in her own.&#xD;
"Shocked almost beyond belief, the young girl&#xD;
hastened to Mrs. H., who was coming through the,&#xD;
hall, and had also unintentionally become a listener&#xD;
to the disgraceful plot. She then told the young la.&#xD;
dies to go to their respective rooms, She proceeded&#xD;
to the schoolroom, and with the assistance of Ella'&#xD;
friend, raised the poor girl from her lowly situation&#xD;
She had fainted,. and. round her mouth was trickliiig&#xD;
a dark stream of blood, which, gushed fearfully as&#xD;
they moved her. She was carried t her apartment,&#xD;
and a physician called, who said there was but little&#xD;
hope. She lay senseless the entire night, the blood&#xD;
continuing to flow at short intervals. As morning&#xD;
advanced she opened her eyes, but was too weak to&#xD;
speak or even move. Mrs. H. sent for her parents to&#xD;
take her where she might be made more comfortable,&#xD;
making up by conribution a nice sum tQ supply he&#xD;
with the needful wants, and promising that she would&#xD;
-come down to see Ella the following Sabbath.&#xD;
" Ella continued very low for a long time, but her&#xD;
disorder, contrary to the expectation of all, took .a&#xD;
more favorable turn. We who had been most inti-&#xD;
mate with her, were favored with a seat by her side.&#xD;
Could you have seen the look of high resignation&#xD;
during her sickness, beaming over her face; could&#xD;
you have heard the gentle, cqmforting words flowing&#xD;
from her loving, forgiving, Christian heart, itwould&#xD;
have left upon your soul, as it did iur, peace, .a&#xD;
warmith, which the world ca never give nor eyer&#xD;

glimpse of a spirit lit up with so much beauty and&#xD;
truth, so mu h serenity and love.&#xD;
" The night that a change was perceived,  innie&#xD;
Wright, who was spending her Sabbath at hone, and&#xD;
who is now  teacher in music and the languages, in&#xD;
the seminar* where Ella attended, offered kindly to&#xD;
accompany me in my watch, it bein  my turn. We&#xD;
were seated by her bed, holding each a thin, trans-&#xD;
parent hand, stroking occasionally her soft hair, when&#xD;
very.suddenly she grasped our hands very tightly,&#xD;
opening her eyes, whispering, 4 Raise me, raise me,&#xD;
and call mo her, for I have but a short time to live.'&#xD;
"We spoke to her physician, who was lying on a&#xD;
couch in a room adjoining, and called her beloved&#xD;
ones, as w eall thought, to receive the last fare-&#xD;
well,&#xD;
"She could say but little before she eho'ked so it&#xD;
seemed quite impossible for her to I ve more than a&#xD;
few minutes. We had all exchang d the farewell&#xD;
kiss, and were watching anxiously for the parting&#xD;
breath, as it became fainter and fainter, until it seemed&#xD;
to stop entirely. As the grief-stricken parents&#xD;
turned to leave the room, we motioned for the Doc-&#xD;
tor to approach. He stepped to the bed-side, took.&#xD;
her pulse, and, after holding it 'fo some time, he&#xD;
whispered in my ear, 'she still breat es.'&#xD;
"Then he grasped both hands, and wiith his eyes&#xD;
bent earnestly upon her, he sat for t least an hour,&#xD;
and we beside him. I shall never fi rget the expres-&#xD;
sion of his face. It seemed to me 3if' his soul had&#xD;
taken hold1 of hers, and held it. Never felt so in&#xD;
my life before. It seemed as if he had commanded&#xD;
&#xD;
her to stay, and that she must. He is a strong man&#xD;
-strong both in body and mind-and moreover, he&#xD;
is what every sensible man is not, kind and good. He&#xD;
has been deeply touched by Ella's pitiful story, and is&#xD;
a sincere admirer of her genius and her many virtues.&#xD;
"I felt then, as he sat there looking at her so, that&#xD;
he' was .doing battle with Death himself, and deter-&#xD;
mined to save her. but what an hour was that.! It&#xD;
seemed as if we almost strained our lives out to save&#xD;
her's. But I think we did, save her. I say we, for as&#xD;
we drew nearer together in the deep silence, where&#xD;
our very breaths were audible, it seemed as if we all&#xD;
understood and resolved to help each other.&#xD;
" I was not surprised when at length the Doctor&#xD;
looked up with a hopful smile, saying, 'Tell Mrs.&#xD;
Clarke to compose herself for a little sleep. Ella will&#xD;
live ! Her pulse beats stronger than it has done for&#xD;
many days. She is now sleeping comfortably.)&#xD;
"Ella lay in her quiet sleep the entire ight. When&#xD;
she awoke, which was a little after daybreak, she&#xD;
seemed quite bright, gazing around the room with ate&#xD;
inquiring look. I put my fingers to my lip, motion-&#xD;
ing her to silence, for the Doctor expressly forbade&#xD;
any conversation. She continued to improve steadily&#xD;
from that time. The Doctor did not encourage her&#xD;
with any prospect of health, only by the strictest&#xD;
care, and even then, he said, it would always be deli-&#xD;
cate.&#xD;

You know she stated to him she wished to have a&#xD;
careful inspection by a competent judge. Well, do&#xD;
you also remember her appealing to two or three&#xD;
persons of literary attainments, for heir judgement&#xD;
upon the self--same piece, craving pe mission to come&#xD;
to them occasionally, asjhe wished " o assist her pa-&#xD;
rents, who had many cares, and she had none to'&#xD;
whom she could apply for aid. You must know it:&#xD;
was a hard task for Ella, with her natural reserve,&#xD;
and delicacy of feeling, to make su h proposals to'&#xD;
people who were almost entire strangers; but, as she&#xD;
told me in confidence, there was one thing which&#xD;
rendered her strong to bear it, and that was the&#xD;
hope, which should never fail her while she lived, of&#xD;
being the means of assistance to her eloved parents,&#xD;
who were well-wearied with their hard battles, and&#xD;
well-stricken -in years. Ella had very little personal&#xD;
acquaintance with those to whom -sh applied for ad-&#xD;
vice, but she was hardly conscious of it, they were&#xD;
brought so close to her by their beautiful writings.&#xD;
Their elevated conversation,. their noble thoughts&#xD;
gushing out so warmly for all humanity, in the shape'&#xD;
of public lectures, kind words spo en of them by&#xD;
friends, whose high-toned sentiments awoke in her&#xD;
heart a corresponding warmth, all co spiring tp exalt:&#xD;

course, she sought their acquanintance ; for she had&#xD;

less of self, and many are too distrustful of mankind,&#xD;
to be willing to undertake a task of that nature, unless&#xD;
a' previous interest has been excited, appealing to&#xD;
their sympathies through personal acquaintance, or&#xD;
judicious praise of a friend.&#xD;
"Though disheartened by refusals which she had&#xD;
reason to expect, and disappointed in not finding&#xD;
mankind as she -had read them from her own blind&#xD;
heart, she did not allow herself to be crushed. Some-&#xD;
times I have thought it had made her stronger in the&#xD;
performance of the duties devolving upon her,.more&#xD;
determined to persevere through the obstacles imped-&#xD;
ing her progress. A short time previous to Ella's&#xD;
illness, her seat-mate received a visit from a friend,&#xD;
distinguished, in the literary world, and introduced&#xD;
him to Ella. After a short conversation on general&#xD;
topics, he stated, that having heard she had a scrap-&#xD;
book of original pieces, he had a great wish to exam-&#xD;
ine it. He was. interested, he said, in the efforts of&#xD;
the young, and would like to assist her. He had not&#xD;
forgotten the timely aid rendered him when a youth,&#xD;
and he was struggling with poverty and its attendant&#xD;
evils. Would she not be willing, he said, for him to&#xD;
take them to 'W-. He would, when he had leis.&#xD;
ure, look them over, point out her: errors, and, if de-&#xD;
sirabe, make- arrangements with a friend  of his, a&#xD;
well-known editor, to publish them. Perhaps, he&#xD;
said, it maay-lead to something more advantageous:.&#xD;

since her convalesence, when to her .great surprise;&#xD;

"Poor Mary Hart! I have left her1 far behind-&#xD;
pardon the digression, for I could ot well speak of&#xD;
one without the other. After EllI was sent home,&#xD;
Mary was publicly expelled from scool, as she stout.&#xD;
ly denied having anything to do with the disgraceful&#xD;
affair, and boldly asserted that th 3 composition, for&#xD;
which she received the prize, wa written by her-&#xD;
self, thou h upon serious investigation, ample evil&#xD;

effectually removed, concluding with addresses from&#xD;
several individuals; among them w s the literary per-&#xD;
son who had befriended Ella, an   had read the&#xD;
first. copy of her composition o  Discipline. He&#xD;
spoke most feelingly of Ella, of her faithfulness to her&#xD;
duties, he bright talents, her perseverence, and deli-&#xD;
cate health, dwelling a long time upon the danger of&#xD;
cultivating such wickedpropensitie3, endeavoring to&#xD;
imprint upon the spirit of Mary Hart a feeling of sin-&#xD;
cere sorrow. There was not a dry eye in the room,&#xD;
with the one exception of Mary, who bore a bold&#xD;
&#xD;
look of defiance, through the entire service. Mary&#xD;
went from there to New York, to the house of a&#xD;
friend, to drown in fashionable excitement, her deep&#xD;
disgrace. It was not long before she- became a&#xD;
thoroughly finished woman of the world, cold, heart.&#xD;
less, and dissipated. She at last eloped with James&#xD;
Arthur, much to the annoyance of her friends. For&#xD;
awhile they went South, and she seemed happy in&#xD;
pursuing follies, still keeping her late hours, sipping&#xD;
her mint-juleps and' sherry-cobblers to perfection.&#xD;
Not long since, young Arthur deserted'her, going no&#xD;
one knew whither, and she returned a Wreck of&#xD;
the once beautiful, to the home of her broken-hearted&#xD;
parents.&#xD;
"Not long since I was passing along the street'&#xD;
where they reside, and seeing quite a crowd collect-&#xD;

to inquire the reason, when I learned that Mrs. Ar-&#xD;
thur had fallen in a fit of delirium tremens. It was&#xD;
a shocking sight to see her lying in such a state,&#xD;
decked out with her silks and laces-dying such a&#xD;

MY DEAR JOURNAL&#xD;
How long I have neglected -you !  Many years&#xD;
have passed since I opened your pages, aid traced&#xD;
thoughts which burned on my brain, and which at&#xD;
times almost seared my heart.  Many trials have&#xD;
come to overshadow our young lives, and many bles-&#xD;
sings have sweetened our oftlerwise bitter cup of ex-&#xD;
istence. Through the clouds ave been many, and the&#xD;
thorns have grown thick, sharp, and plenteous by the&#xD;
dusty roadside, yet  there has been. enough of sun-&#xD;
shine to enable me to find now and then a sweet rose,&#xD;
to strengthen me with its beauty, though it might lie&#xD;
sleeping beneath the thorns. Our lives have been so&#xD;
chequered with heavy burdens, pnd overshadowed&#xD;
with 14 hopes deferred," that I have not cared to record&#xD;
thenm. I left you when I was just abuot entering a&#xD;
new duty. It was ark unpromising season ofthe year&#xD;
when I opened my school, most of the children hav-&#xD;
ing left for country seats. As my mother was so&#xD;
wearied with the additional charge my absence&#xD;
caused, and my prospects for the time were so poor,&#xD;
after two months' trial I abandoned it, to return to the&#xD;
arduous, unvaried life, of a housekeeper. It was,&#xD;
however, only for a few months. An excellent open-&#xD;
ing unexpectedly presented itself; and as affairs at&#xD;
home had put on a rather more promising aspect, I&#xD;
entered at once upon my present situation, and have&#xD;
never in the least regretted having dons so. It is a&#xD;

There" have been many changes in our family.&#xD;
Willie, Annie, and Carrie, are all ma ried, happily, I&#xD;
hope ; 'and I am  content to receiv the blessing,&#xD;
though long delayed, that has fallen upon me, the-&#xD;
completion, of, all my cherished desires.  Loving:&#xD;
friends have come kindly to- my rescue. I found:&#xD;
when I least expected them-when  y-soul was cry-.&#xD;

They came and blest me. Seeking   e out through,&#xD;
their own intuitive powers, they have been my coun-.&#xD;
sellors and guides, encouraging me, and pointing the&#xD;
way, where I may make myself permanently useful;&#xD;
to my dearly-loved family. Through the unbounded&#xD;
influence of Mrs. G-, I am now a s ocessfnl teach-&#xD;
er, as Principal in one of our public schools.&#xD;
My duties are arduous ; my cares are many; but.&#xD;
my hope, and my reward, are sure. I am becoming.&#xD;
strongly attached to my new vocation; and I flatter&#xD;
myself I am much beloved by my pupils. The.little,&#xD;
feet that come running toward me, as I enter the&#xD;
shady street. leading to the school-house, the bright,&#xD;
loving eyes, and eager faces, greeting me as I enter&#xD;
the room, the readiness to comply with requests they*&#xD;
scarcely can understand, the delicate offerings laid"&#xD;
on my desk,. the many invitations received from, the,,&#xD;
parents, and their hearty concurrence in my views.&#xD;
and wishes, compensate for all my wearisome hours,;&#xD;
imparting to me' a strength, a hope, a joy which I_;&#xD;
cannot..express.&#xD;

anxieties. Their little ones are growing up around&#xD;
them, crowned with virtue, truth, and all that is&#xD;
excellent and good. They are all receiving excellent&#xD;
educations; 'and two are intending to be teachers.&#xD;
Soon will come my vacation, a rest of seven weeks;.&#xD;
and then, after the lapse of many years, shall I re-:&#xD;
visit the dear place of my birth; the sweet, sunny&#xD;
scenes of my youth. I shall have ample time then to&#xD;
look around, before the gathering of the sons and&#xD;
daughters of Newport takes place, which will he the&#xD;
last Tuesday in August. Our family will join me&#xD;
there, so I shall have company enough on my return'&#xD;
home.&#xD;
Pet Isabel says: "Take me out to walk, Vio, after&#xD;
you have done writing; please do'?" .And this&#xD;
request I am forced to comply with, especially after.&#xD;
her little rose-hud of a month has been pressed to&#xD;
mine.  So I bid you, dear Journal! adieu, for the&#xD;
present.  i&#xD;
I am now in the steamboat iengjoying a lovely breeze,&#xD;
and, to me, as sweet scenery as the eye -ever beheld.'&#xD;
I am wending my way toward Newport, 1she dear&#xD;
place of my birth. Is it possible I shall so soon see&#xD;
my dear,. dear friends?  I can sca cely realize that&#xD;
years have passed over my head sinbe I beheld them.&#xD;
Little Isa, is bearing me company; and by her cheer-.&#xD;
ful prattle and engaging ways, is ap arently beguiling.&#xD;
the monotonous 'hours of many. o the passengers.&#xD;
She is flitting around like a little fairy. One minute&#xD;
she is ,sitting by my side, busily' ooking over the&#xD;
boat-side, watching.the wide foaming wake, the great&#xD;
wheels make as they roll in the water, and puzzling.&#xD;
&#xD;

<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC8306-00000083"/>&#xD;
my brain, with her thousand-and-one questions,which&#xD;
a philosopher could scarcely answer. At present she&#xD;
is sitting in the lap of an elderly gentleman, whose&#xD;
gold spectacles she has monopolized and mounted on&#xD;
her own forehead, helping him to read the new,&#xD;
occasionally spicing the silence with a faithful ac-&#xD;
count of family affairs in general; and of sister Viov&#xD;
in particular.  It is the first time she was ever in a-&#xD;
steamboat, and the novelty of her position amuse&#xD;
her exceedingly. For some time she has been sitting&#xD;
opposite the' looking-glass, watching intently' th&amp;amp;e'&#xD;
various things reflected there. I had observed an'&#xD;
unpleasant expression shadowing her sweet eyes,&#xD;
when she turned around to me, saying:: "I do' n't like&#xD;
those people in the next room; let's move our seatg&#xD;
for they mock every thing' every body does out here"&#xD;
A man just went to drink some water at the table',;&#xD;
and another man in the other room- did just so. That'&#xD;
woman out there moves every time you do ; and that&#xD;
little girl, dressed just. like me, does' every thing I&#xD;
do; and I do-n't like her one' bit.' I think she is very&#xD;
wicked:; do n't y'ou,-Vio ?"&#xD;
It was a long time before I could persuade her she.&#xD;
was deceived by a looking-glass. In order to' be&amp;amp;&#xD;
convinced, she had to lay her hand upon it. After&#xD;
that, for a long time, she has seemed to be enjoying&#xD;
the mistake', as well as the' passengers, laughing&#xD;
quietly to:-herself; as 'she watches the movements'&#xD;
refiected° there..&#xD;
0; look,Vio! sister., look! and tell me what th'ag&#xD;

" Those are cannons," said I. "Cannons, cannons!&#xD;
I wonder what they are for?" muttered she. "O, see&#xD;
that funny little man, walking close by the edge !&#xD;
Won't he fall off, Yio, into the water ? Hark ! do n't&#xD;
you hear music ?" and she clapped her hands with&#xD;
delight, as the clear, sweet tones of a bugle echoed&#xD;
over the water.&#xD;
"Here we are close by the wharf. . Come Vio,&#xD;
come ! .We shall be alone, and then we shall have to&#xD;
stay out all night on the water, arid may be we shall&#xD;
be drowned; then, what would father do for his lit:&#xD;
tle Isa, say, Rio ?"&#xD;
Her question was unanswerable and she clung to&#xD;
my dress and plead so piteously, I was forced to pass&#xD;
my- way through the dense crowd; but after mush&#xD;
pushing, and squeezing, and tugging, we reached the&#xD;
wharf, where I found my friends waiting in fond. ex-&#xD;
pectation.&#xD;
I am now in the home of my childhood, or rather&#xD;
my father's home, and a very welcome greeting have&#xD;
I received.&#xD;
"Is it here," said .little Isa; "where you told me&#xD;
you got so many cakes, pies and kisses, from dear&#xD;
father and dear mother?".&#xD;
" Yes, darling, and. it makes me very sad to see&#xD;
that seat in the corner vacant. TlIe great arm-chair&#xD;
is now rarely ever disturbed. Tle -form that was&#xD;
wont to fill it, where has it gone ?. Death has visited&#xD;
our hearth-stone, and on his dusky wings borne our&#xD;

"Don't you miss her," said Isa. "I wish I had a&#xD;
:grandmother to play with me, as .you used to have.n&#xD;
"Miss her? Oh, the sad loss of her we loved,'&#xD;
said I to myself, more than in answer, to her. How&#xD;
ca  we speak of it?. Let us walk through these&#xD;
open doors. It seems as though I must see her'&#xD;
standing near her bureau, adjusting her cap, or tak-&#xD;
ing out something nice from the tall cupboard,' to'&#xD;
place in my liand. My heart gushes with all j my&#xD;
childishness and yearning .love, and my arms almost&#xD;
open to enfold her in my embrace. We miss her, we&#xD;
say. Is there a word that can express our heavy&#xD;
loss ?  She shed such a beautiful light upon her&#xD;
home. All who enjoyed a seat in her family circle&#xD;
felt her sweet influence over them. May we not hope&#xD;
that she will bless with her holy presence the ever to&#xD;
be remembered Union. God grant it; I feel it must&#xD;
be so.&#xD;
" Do you think, Vio," said Isa, who requested me&#xD;
to read to her what I had been writing, "that grand-&#xD;
mother comes down from Heaven such a distance,&#xD;
to see us ? I should- think she would lose her way,&#xD;
shouldn't you? Well, she wont. know me any how&#xD;
will she? I wish I could see her just once, though.&#xD;
When I shut my eyes on the pillow, I can see stars&#xD;
and ever so many pretty things ; may be I could see&#xD;
her if I'd only look longer. I mean to' be goo all&#xD;
the time, so she'll come to see Me," she whispere , as&#xD;
she seated herself in my lap, for me. to undress her._&#xD;
When her 'night dress had been adjusted, she put&#xD;
ber arms round my neck, saying, "Let me be our&#xD;
baby to-night, and rock me just one little while. I-&#xD;

After-saying "Qur Father," and "Now I lay mne,"&#xD;
she then plead that I would tell her- some stories,&#xD;
which I did,.-until she dropped-asleep.&#xD;
Dear: little thing! how sweetly she looked: her&#xD;

the. little classical head; the oth r resting upon a&#xD;
brilliant colored spread, of"" Job's troubles," which"&#xD;
she had chosen to sleep under-" S I can have some-.&#xD;

Long before. the light, when Ilay in a partial sleep&#xD;
I heard her talking to herself about the dear grand-&#xD;
mother, who she 4as told patched.the spread during&#xD;
her sickness. " Grandma, did you: come down~ to see&#xD;
your little Isa to-night ? If you did, why didn't you&#xD;

As I review it, what a tide of feeling does this dear&#xD;

the perfect abandonment of grief-grief for the lost&#xD;
home, the lost hopes, the lost joys, never restored to.&#xD;

but bubbles, cast up by the rolling waves of time ;&#xD;
we grasp them, and they disperse in air. We follow&#xD;
their beckoning rainbows, only to find .ourse ves in&#xD;
the wilds of despair. They lure us to a trackless&#xD;
forest, and then leave us in a bewildering, unfathom&#xD;
able gloom. It is necessary to fortify ourselves with&#xD;
a strong will, as we enter the world-" a will to do-&#xD;
a will to be-a vill to bear." We should strengthen&#xD;
ourselves by co stant intercourse with Heaven, by a&#xD;
generous culture of that beautiful faith which a large&#xD;
charity brings, by shunning all that conflicts with o r&#xD;
inward consciousness of right, and by receiving onl&#xD;
that which. our own hearts can accept as good. W&#xD;
cannot judge what will be good for one another , but&#xD;
if we all live closely up to our inner light, unbiased&#xD;
by creeds, made from the spirit of intolerance and&#xD;
selfishness, we cannot go astray..&#xD;

While so many proofs lie before us of the existence&#xD;
of a kind Father's hand over all, I am loth to believe&#xD;
there is in reality a single infidel.&#xD;
To my mind the Creator has spread such glorious&#xD;
everlasting proofs, there cannot be a sincere doubt&#xD;
er; and if there is one of those persons living on this&#xD;
broad earth, then should our sympathies close around-i&#xD;
him, for rest assured, not a more wretched person&#xD;
lives, than he who thinks this world was made by&#xD;
chance, and that when the friends he has most tender-&#xD;
ly loved and cherished, pass from his sight, they are&#xD;
lost forever. It is hard to conceive of that darkness&#xD;
of soul that shuts out hope. Let us seek to shew&#xD;
such unfortunates whose hopes go out in the eternal&#xD;
shadows of the grave, that there is no death. Love and&#xD;
pity the poor soul that cannot see the kind hand&#xD;
stretching over the broad ocean, the wide-spreading&#xD;
fields, the fragrant flowers,, and all that earth is&#xD;
strewed, with, an d the numberless worlds lighting up&#xD;
the vast heavens; nor read the imperishable 'truth&#xD;
that shines alike in minds noble and ignoble, the im-&#xD;

" When are you going to see Aunt Katy, Vio, and&#xD;
cousin Minnie? You told me I should visit them&#xD;
with you," asked Isa of me one morning. "Can't we&#xD;
go to-morrow ?"&#xD;
" No,for Aunt Katy is quite sick and nervous, and&#xD;
little feet would disturb her, and cousin imnnie is in&#xD;
New York. But she will return next week, then&#xD;
we'll go to see them."&#xD;
"I could put my feet in my pocket when we visit&#xD;
Aunt Katy, and whisper so softly nobody could hear;&#xD;
and I'd sit down on a little stool, just s ,, Vio," said&#xD;
Isa, as she demonstrated her thoughts b the proper&#xD;
action. "I do want to see her so much ! I love her&#xD;
so dearly! and she's such a funny talking woman."&#xD;
After renewing my promise and rec unting the&#xD;
pleasures in store for her, she sat down cheerfully in&#xD;
one corner of the room, with her books and babies,&#xD;
and I once more resume my pen.&#xD;

CHAPTER XVI,&#xD;
&#xD;
. I suppose, Dear Journal, before I tell you. of the&#xD;
pleasant hours I enjoy in reviewing my native home,&#xD;
you would like to have a slight description of New-&#xD;
port and its surroundings, as it appeared to me from&#xD;
my own stand-point of observation, this afternoon.&#xD;
I shall commence inspecting the charmed beauties of&#xD;
the place.&#xD;
Newport is situated upon' the island of Rhode&#xD;
Island. It was called Aquidnek by the Indians, sig-&#xD;
nifying the "Isle of Peace," and 'on account of ithe&#xD;
mildness of its climate, and the beauty of its scenery,&#xD;
it was known by the early settlers as the ' Eden of&#xD;
America."&#xD;
The waters around are studded with little green&#xD;
islands. NewTport is in the form of a semi-circle, and&#xD;
is seated on a gentle declivity, gradually sloping&#xD;
to the water's edge, where the Bay tenderly kisses&#xD;
it with its sunny ripples on one side, while the Ocean&#xD;
comes thundering against the rocky fortress on the&#xD;
o ther. The distinguishing features of the scene are&#xD;
not to be read from the bay, for almost all that can&#xD;
be seen of the shore isa pile of dilapidated wharves&#xD;
and buildings, whose weatlier-beaten visage indicates.&#xD;
rough usage from the heavy hand of time.&#xD;
The old, quiet, dull picture is now and then relieved&#xD;
by a red-shirted sailor, half leaning upon a wood-pile,&#xD;
or mounted upon a barrel, with his head resting Lon&#xD;
the window sill. You will sometimes see companies&#xD;
of them sitting in groups around the half-open doors&#xD;

dreaming of the tender past or hopeful future, while&#xD;
the smoke slowly arising from their pipes is wreath-&#xD;
ing in graceful folds far above the abstracted gaze.&#xD;
Men and boys may also be seen immersed ii water&#xD;
knee high, searching for clams, or bending over their&#xD;
slender shing rods, holding up in the silver sunlight&#xD;
the shining prizes that are secured to thei 'attractive&#xD;
baits, and a close observer might see suflusing their&#xD;
eyes and faces, the crimson sparkle of delight, as&#xD;
their dreams of gain are so soon to-be realized..&#xD;
But let us'enter the very depths of t e town, or&#xD;
city, as it is now called, and the heart, des pite the un:&#xD;
favorable impressions and disappointme ts, will be&#xD;
surprised out of its coldness, at the wonderful beau-&#xD;
ties, both of nature and art, that are spread out be-&#xD;
fore the observer. The whole scene is s pleasingly&#xD;
combined, and so delicately shaded, that t e true lov-&#xD;
er of the Beautiful never wearies with the varied&#xD;
views that compose a picture, whose exceeding love-&#xD;
liness cannot be excelled.&#xD;
Newport is a place of great romantic beauty and&#xD;
interest, rife with the traditions and ari tocracy of&#xD;
the olden times.  Possessing a very heal hy climate,&#xD;
it is at present a pleasing resort for strangers, where&#xD;
many an invalid is being renewed in body and. mind;&#xD;
where the fire returns to the eye, the ros -warmth to&#xD;
the pallid cheek, and hope to crimson the heart with&#xD;
her genial tide, through the combining influences of&#xD;
the cool, bracing atmosphere, sea baths, fishing, rid-&#xD;
inig, free exchanges of wit and good huni or, and by&#xD;
the pleasant rambles in the sweet scenery of the&#xD;
present, and the slumbering ruins of the past.;.&#xD;

&#xD;
" Ready, Vio ?" called out little Isa, as she stood&#xD;
equipped for her walk; " Aunt Jenny says she has&#xD;
been waiting between five and ten minutes for you."&#xD;
We set off, Isa capering like a little dog., s de-&#xD;
lighted was she with the privilege of accompanying&#xD;
us. We entered the Synagogue, situated on Touro&#xD;
street. This fine building was erected by Abraham&#xD;
Touro, a wealthy Jew.&#xD;
Here the Jews congregated for public worship in&#xD;
years "langsyne," when they .numbered many, and&#xD;
were prosperous, The town then was -in a highly&#xD;
flourishing condition, and the noble intellect and&#xD;
warm hearts of Channing and other good men, were&#xD;
breathing out their lowly lives in this enchanting&#xD;
scenery, and catching inspiration from this Heaven-&#xD;
freighted island.&#xD;
As we entered the building, Isa crept close to me&#xD;
and endeavored to hide herself under cover.of my&#xD;
mantle.&#xD;
"0, I am afraid, ;io don't let us go in !" and her&#xD;
voice sank, to a whisper. " Arn't you afraid the&#xD;
' Mummy' will come out? I'll sit on the door-step,&#xD;
while you go in. I like the sunshine 'better than&#xD;
those old walls," she added, dropping quietly be-&#xD;
hind.&#xD;
As I gaze upon the Temple in its simple, quaint&#xD;
grandeur, how can I picture the thoughts that come&#xD;
crowding up so thickly before me, bringing sweet,&#xD;
sunny memories of the past, in the local legends that&#xD;
were given to me by old and revered friends, as they&#xD;
were given to them by those who had gone before.&#xD;
ow often have I, in company with my young&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC8306-00000090"/>&#xD;
,1&#xD;
&#xD;
friends, with hushed breath and wildly throbbing&#xD;
hearts, pressed on, urged by a' restless curiosity&#xD;
for exploring, until we had searched every nook open&#xD;
to view, for the "mummy " Isa spoke of, which was&#xD;
said to be encased here. There, too, I have lingered&#xD;
long at nightfall, to catch a glimpse of the ghosts&#xD;
that were expected to flit through the galleries in the&#xD;
hush of evening, to review thel4ecenes of their mor-&#xD;
tality.&#xD;
How many times I have tried to decipher the in-&#xD;
scription on the. marble slab, and longed to raise it,&#xD;
thinking that that carefully preserved remnant be-&#xD;
longing once to the beauty and dignity of woman,&#xD;
must find a home here. I would sit and think of the&#xD;
life that was once bustling and moving there ; of the&#xD;
warm hearts that were lightened of their load, by&#xD;
the eloquent, earnest words, stirred up from the&#xD;
depths of sincere conviction, relating to the " Messi-&#xD;
ah " of the "Kingdom to come," listening, as we&#xD;
listen now, to what appeared to them to be the re-&#xD;
vealing of truth.&#xD;
I ever enter this sanctuary with a feeling of rever-&#xD;
ential awe, not unmingled with deep sadness, for the&#xD;
Jews of the Bible times, come up powerfully before&#xD;
me, while I gaze on the things that once bore the&#xD;
stamp of life, with all its spiritual and passional emo-&#xD;
tions. My whole soul is filled with devotional ten-&#xD;
derness. The echo of our voices moves me, amid the&#xD;
stirring, waving silence, like the sweet, sad murmur&#xD;
of the sea-shell, that seems to be made real only by&#xD;
what it has lost. But I must fling off the dust and&#xD;
gloom that have gathered upon me, and emerge once&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
e&#xD;
ti&#xD;
&#xD;
more into the open air, where the free sunlight'can&#xD;
exhilarate the spirit, as well as refresh the form.&#xD;
From the Synagogue we went to visit the Ceme-&#xD;
tery. Isa looked pleased as we entered the gate, and&#xD;
soon ound herself at home among the long grass&#xD;
and butter cups, nestling .in among the graves, talk-&#xD;
ing and singing to herself. I sit upon the marble&#xD;
slab or lowly mounds of the earth-dead, and then do&#xD;
I almost feel their shadowy presence around me, my&#xD;
thoug ts so quickly follow their bidding, and for a&#xD;
long ti e I feel as they have felt, and see. as they&#xD;
have s en.&#xD;
Afte leaving t e Cemetery, we called at Redwood&#xD;
ibrar y, which was erected through the generosity&#xD;
of Abr ham Redwodd, in 1747. Very few of the old&#xD;
ooks 're now remaining, most of them having been&#xD;
estroy d at the time of the war.&#xD;
It is 'xceedingly refreshing after taking a stroll on&#xD;
he hill, and the beach, to sit down quietly with one&#xD;
f the many interesting volumes which grace the&#xD;
helves of the library; or if too wearied to enjoy the&#xD;
weet  occupation . one experiences quite as much&#xD;
leasur in examining the works of art, or the many&#xD;
uriositi s and antiquities which have; from time to&#xD;
me, been gathered into the library.&#xD;
From there we walked to Mill-street, where is&#xD;
tuated, in 'n enclosure, the "Old' Stone Mill," or&#xD;
ower.&#xD;
It is a builng in a circular form, supported by&#xD;
ght pdlars, prettily arched at the top, above which,&#xD;

remains of a fire-place ; and there is a slight appear-&#xD;
ance of a floor being laid there formerly.&#xD;
" Is n't this a pretty building ?  Did you use to&#xD;
play here, when you were a little girl, like me, Vio ?"&#xD;
asked Isa.t&#xD;
"Yes. I used to come here very often with my&#xD;
companions, and play ',catch.' I was told it was&#xD;
haunted, and if we could run around it a certain&#xD;
number of times, the ' old man,' would certainly&#xD;
appear to us. Being very anxious to test the truth,&#xD;
of it, and besides having considerable curiosity to'&#xD;
see him, gave me great desire to try the experiment."&#xD;
"Diydhe ever catch you?" questioned Isa, with&#xD;
her eyes staring in affright, while peeping into it&#xD;
cautiously, as if she expected to see him hiding be-&#xD;
hind one of the.pillars.&#xD;
" No, for before we had completed running around&#xD;
the number of times, my limbs refused to support&#xD;
me ; so you see I lost the pleasure of being chased&#xD;
by that celebrated individual."&#xD;
This morning I fulfilled my pifomise of calling on&#xD;
the young stranger who had given the flowers to Isa,&#xD;
Afew days previous.&#xD;
I found he had'not been too lavish in the praise&#xD;
f sweet Leone Rosemeir,. for, if ever I saw an angel&#xD;
personified on earth, it was she. I. think I never saw&#xD;
a being endowed with such a pure, lofty expression,&#xD;
plainly indicating that she had placed her heart in&#xD;
the kind keeping of God and His angels. Even little&#xD;
Isa, felt it; for she looked when she spoke to Leone,&#xD;
as if she could kneel to her. Her mother, Mrs. Rose-&#xD;
meir, wore a settled expression of sorrow on her face,&#xD;
&#xD;
as she&#xD;

sweet Leone, as she extended her thin little&#xD;
t parting, "for you know I am a poor feeble&#xD;
and can't enjoy the pleasures of life like you.&#xD;
little children ! They beguile- my pain, and&#xD;
omething in my heart to feed upon, through&#xD;

erday, at nine o'clock, we were equipped for a&#xD;
the Beach. It was a lovely morning, with&#xD;
ugh cloud, to render it pleasant while walk-&#xD;

doomed to a sad fright, indeed, for I lost my&#xD;
ster. While I was looking intently on the&#xD;
before me, she had disappeared, and was gone,&#xD;
not how long, before I misfsd her. I ran&#xD;

into every little child's face, interrupting&#xD;

pleasure-seekers, I doubt not, or at least they looked&#xD;
so. At length I spied her far above me on a bank,&#xD;
seated on the grass beside a gentleman, chatting&#xD;
gaily. Upon a nearer approach I perceived he was&#xD;
her new friend of steamboat recollection. As I drew&#xD;
near, he rose with the gallantry and agility of a much&#xD;
younger person, and, spreading his handkerchief on a&#xD;
piece of rock, he offered me the seat.&#xD;
When in the steamboat, having his back partially&#xD;
turned to me, I barely saw his features; but now,&#xD;
when seated so closely, I had a fine opportunity to&#xD;
observe the quick play of the pleasant thoughts on&#xD;
his benevolent face. He smiled as he met my earnest&#xD;
glance, and said:&#xD;
"I have not missed witnessing this healthful, charm-&#xD;
ing sport a single morning since my arrival here,&#xD;
when the weather has been, fine. Very often I join&#xD;
them, and I feel as bright and blithe as the youngest&#xD;
here. Look there, just see the fathers and nurses&#xD;
flinging their babies into the sea!' Hear the little&#xD;
fellows cry. I don't believe- they'll die of consump-&#xD;
tion, with such good stout lungs as they now have."&#xD;
My elbow-friend looked upon Isa with an indulgent&#xD;
smile, at her observations, then pointed out to us a&#xD;
party of young ladies who were -enjoying their sports&#xD;
finely.&#xD;
See, those rogueish elves," he exclaimed, 11"have&#xD;
got hold of their father now. The old fellow will&#xD;
catch it this time. There. he goes, good, good, good.&#xD;
Ha! ha! ha! how I wish I was in his place. They'd&#xD;
get it ;" and he rubbed his hands with evident plea-&#xD;
sure. " See those countless heads that are bowing&#xD;

Per friend adieu, and accompanied me on a walk.&#xD;
proceeded to the "Forty 'Steps," which we de-&#xD;

that never wearies, and the sweet, low murmurs&#xD;

how freely the light of my early days comes up&#xD;

ful bland months of Spring and Summer !&#xD;
views of cowslips, lilies, and roses, kept peep-&#xD;
into our eyes in anticipation of our pleasant&#xD;
through open fields and shady lanes. Then&#xD;
the healthful sport of washing and playing in&#xD;

ning through the fields, the animated objects, and the&#xD;
old wood-colored house, standing on the summit of&#xD;
the hill. I well remember how we used to watch the&#xD;
smoke pouring out from the chimney, ascending,&#xD;
wreathing, and curling, higher and higher, until to&#xD;
our gaze it seemed lost in heaven, with the splendid&#xD;
sunset filling up the back-ground. There were birds&#xD;
dipping their white wings in the foam, white as the&#xD;
fleecy clouds above ; and the quiet town beneath our&#xD;
feet completed the picture. And to these noble&#xD;
sights, came fitting sounds, the trembling, the rolling,&#xD;
the unceasing heave of the moaning sea. The whole&#xD;
scene filled our hearts with so. much joy, so much&#xD;
love, it is impossible to express it.&#xD;
' Then. father would relate to us many stories of&#xD;
the good old\times. Where we had seated ourselves&#xD;
we could just discern the spot where our great-grand-&#xD;
mother lived so comfortably in her new house,-previ-&#xD;

I entertained Isa with many stories, among which&#xD;
was that of a ship that once rode gently over the&#xD;
billows, darting in and out, through the threatening&#xD;
rocks and dangerous breakers, unharmed, until at&#xD;
length, with the lightness of a bird, it landed safely&#xD;
on the glistening sand, unpiloted by a human behng.&#xD;

peated, and the chills, would creep .up into my hair,,&#xD;

On returning from our walk Isa plead earnestly to&#xD;
call upon her friend Leone, a wish which I readily&#xD;
gratified. We found. her very ill,-but still able to&#xD;
converse with those around her. She seemed very&#xD;
glad to see us, and on our leaving presented Isa with&#xD;
a cage-bird, as a memento of love,&#xD;
The next day. we received sad news of dear Leone,&#xD;
who that night breathed' out her lovely, though sor-&#xD;
rowful earth-life, and was received into the. arms of&#xD;
the good angel who had long been waiting for her.&#xD;
Never shall I forget the pure, the angelic smile,&#xD;
lighting up the still features, as I viewed for the last&#xD;
time the remains of her whom we so tenderly loved.&#xD;
Her friends bore her away to the place of her&#xD;
birth, to lay her in a sweet valley, which is watered&#xD;
by a river and shaded by mountains. As Mrs.-&#xD;
Rosemier bade me adieu, I placed in her hand a&#xD;
slight token, dictated from my heart, dedicated to-&#xD;
OUR PET 'LEONE.&#xD;
Sweet as the twilight whisper,&#xD;
Pale as the moonbeam's wane,&#xD;
Weak as a drooping lily,&#xD;
With scarce a dense of pain ;&#xD;
Gentle as summer zephyr,&#xD;
As musical each tone,&#xD;
Were the voice, the face, the bearing,&#xD;
Of our precious pet, Leone.&#xD;
'Twas in the pleasant spring time,&#xD;
When nature did delight&#xD;
To fleck her hills and mountains&#xD;
With streams of golden light,&#xD;

Ah; then ! 'two d seek her window,&#xD;
And nestle in her hair.&#xD;

Come, it is time to pray."&#xD;
Their quick ear caught the murmur ;&#xD;
With their wreathe of braided flowers&#xD;
And myrtle leaves they crowned her,&#xD;
Queen of their sunny hours.&#xD;
ghtly they closed around her,&#xD;
Reverently kissed her hand,&#xD;
atching the Christ.like sweetness,&#xD;
As she spoke of the Far off Land.&#xD;
She talked of its fadeless beauty--&#xD;
She said, "by the golden gate,&#xD;
With angels bearing company,&#xD;
For my loved ones I will wait."&#xD;
rayerfully and tearfully&#xD;
They knelt in the closing light,&#xD;
ceiving blessings pure and fond-&#xD;
Our Leone's last good night.&#xD;
At the foot of the maple bower,&#xD;
Down by the gurgling stream,&#xD;
We laid the earthy of her life-&#xD;

S"Poor little birdie! you've lost your sweet mis.&#xD;
tress now," murmured Isa sorrowfully, when, on re-&#xD;
turning from the funeral, she stepped up to the cage&#xD;
where the bird was doing his best to give her one of&#xD;
his sweetest songs of welcome. "You could not love&#xD;
her as I did, for I used to lay my head on her lap,&#xD;
and she would talk, 0, so good ! You couldn't un-&#xD;
derstand it; b)it I did. And she -would tell me all&#xD;
about Heaven, and the dear Jesus, wlo, she said, had&#xD;
taken her heart, and that she was going to live with&#xD;
im all the -time.. I cried when they carried her&#xD;
way, for they told me they would have to cover up&#xD;
er dear face with the cold earth, and I cannot bear&#xD;
o think of it. It is too bad! .isn't it, poor little or-&#xD;
phan birdie? But her mother says she will some-'&#xD;
imes come to see us, though we can't see her, and&#xD;
he will watch over us, anal whisper in our ears how&#xD;
o be good. We wont forget to  listen for her, when&#xD;
he people get asleep; and we wont wake anybody,&#xD;
ill we? But we will keep just as still as little mice,&#xD;
and if you don't understand her when she says good&#xD;
night, I will tell you what she means.'.&#xD;
"0 dear.! I feel so bad," sighed she, throwing down&#xD;
er bonnet and cape, and laying her little head on my.&#xD;
boulder, as the tears were ,fast raining down her&#xD;
plump cheeks, gemming with "the bright .drops her&#xD;

Dear 'ittle Isa! Every day I see some new beauty&#xD;
in her; her mind gr ws rapidly, and I am often sur-&#xD;
prised at the interest she takes in everything. Her&#xD;
wise rearks, and s ngular questions often surprise&#xD;
and- puzle me. -.Then. she will express herself so&#xD;
prettily when coa.v rsing, I am often charmed to&#xD;
hear, exen when I eel. ruffled at her interruptions.&#xD;
Last evening wed sent with a friend, who is pass-&#xD;

over th dear scenes and the pleasant hours we had&#xD;
passed together, of he friends whom we loved, and&#xD;
who were now scatt red over the earth. We spoke&#xD;

&#xD;
Isa was krery restless all night, ta&#xD;
in her dreams of her visit. Long&#xD;
morning, he awakened me with:&#xD;
time to dr ss." After which, I dro&#xD;
awaking,~ found her sitting on th&#xD;

whichwere left hanging on the back&#xD;

called the head. "Now mother," s&#xD;
ing my arm, "you must. hold dolly&#xD;
Then she proceeded to unrobe hers&#xD;
while. "Now Isa," she continued,&#xD;
very sorry you spoiled sister Vio's&#xD;
very wrong to take it without. leav&#xD;
Vio  feel very  sad ;  for the  dear la&#xD;

Minnie.  You must n't interruptI&#xD;

I must set a trap fo it.". '- And  hile she is talking&#xD;
about it, you and I, w11 laugh under the bed-clothes,&#xD;
so that she won't thin it was we who woke her up&#xD;
so nicely."&#xD;
Isa was about to suit the action to the resolve, by&#xD;
very cautiously draw g dolly's fingers over my lips,&#xD;
and around my eyes, hen'I could control myself no&#xD;
longer, but burst  out right with merriment ; when&#xD;
she very innocentlyasked: "Why, who woke you&#xD;
up, sister Vio ?"&#xD;
She scarcely touched her breakfast, although there&#xD;
was set before her scme of Aunt Jenny's tempting&#xD;
johnny-cake, and delicious blackberies; but she kept&#xD;
rising from the tabl to look out of the window,&#xD;
watching for Mr. Seymour, Minniers husband, who&#xD;
was expected to call for us.&#xD;
"Come Vio, come ! here, is the marriage ! Hurry!&#xD;
hurry !" said she, as the last look proved successful.&#xD;
She was in such a state of excitement, I could&#xD;
scarcely tie her bonnet; and bhf9r  was ready, she&#xD;
was snugly seated in the carriage.&#xD;
"Waiting for you, Vio,", said she, as I gage my&#xD;
hand to Mr. Seymour.&#xD;
We enjoyed our rid exceedingly, though it seem-&#xD;
ed quite short.&#xD;
"' Have n't we had a pleasant rids, Vio," remarked&#xD;
Isaa " I only wish it might havebeen ever so many&#xD;
miles morea.ny&#xD;

the bough of a tree, which is bendi g prettily to the&#xD;
brook.&#xD;
But here comes a peacock, wvth his beautiful&#xD;
plumes of gold and blue-full spread, as be is strutting&#xD;
about the door, whispering to himself: "There is not&#xD;
so finely  dressed bird as Iin all Newport. Won't&#xD;
the Sons take a long-look at me?' "Oh," answers&#xD;
Kitty, who is standing with ebony Nep, on the door&#xD;
sill, and over-hears the incautiou  remarks, .while&#xD;
looking o4 the peacock's pretensions, with a kind of&#xD;
quiet scorn: "Fine.feathers do nt make fine birds,&#xD;
you know. What will you do with your harsh voice&#xD;
when they invite you to sing their welcome home?&#xD;
Ard when asked to dance in honor of their arrival;&#xD;
what will you do with your ugly f et? 'Say, pretty&#xD;
bird, won't you be glad to drop yo r fan over them:&#xD;

Now I s4ee a calf with his chain grmly stapled in&#xD;
the ground, to keep him from play ng truant. He is&#xD;
looking, with a shade of envy upon his smooth face,&#xD;
at the freedom they enjoy ; and, as I listen, I:can.&#xD;
hear him paying: "Oh, if I could run across the&#xD;
fields only once, would n't I have  good time? I&#xD;
do n't see bhy they tie me up more than the others."&#xD;
We can see from, here, very distinctly, old "Wal-&#xD;
cott," with , his grass-grown sides gazing absently on&#xD;
the. lovely bay before him, while he little vessels&#xD;
quietly moving over the water, with the gentle&#xD;
splash and dash at his feet remind him of the time&#xD;

vations made upon his towering&#xD;

brings his gaze nearer home, for&#xD;

" Those are very foolish ideas for a woman to ad-&#xD;

"It's my opinion you unsex yourself very materially,&#xD;
by uttering them. St. Paul teaches us to be silent on&#xD;
such subjects, and I answer you for ne, I am glad to&#xD;
follow his advice. I don't see why  omen need in-&#xD;
terest themselves in such matters; and, let me tell&#xD;
you, that in my opinion, it is not ery lady-like, or&#xD;
becoming in you, to speak in that crude, independent&#xD;
way. Woman had better let such th ngs alone. Men&#xD;
love to have us lean on them. The are much more&#xD;
&#xD;
proud of us, and are willing to pay the price, if we&#xD;
can keep ourselves looking delicate and richly&#xD;
dressed. What do they think of a woman plainly&#xD;
dressed, with coarse hands and red face, brought on&#xD;
by her vulgar work? Place her in a drawing-room,&#xD;
even when richly dressed, and what a figure she&#xD;
makes ! Do ou think they will notice her? No, in-&#xD;
deed! No more than would I or other refined wo-&#xD;
men. What signifies her education, or her mind, to&#xD;
them ? They can talk upon subjects that, are deep,&#xD;
when they attend their Lyceums or Clubs; but when&#xD;
they come among us women, they want and expect to&#xD;
be amused. For my part, I want nothing better to&#xD;
do, than to attend to their wishes ; and, as I don't&#xD;
love work, and never mean to work, let the case be&#xD;
what it may,. I think a little flattery will do no harm.&#xD;
And in keeping them pleased with ourselves, they&#xD;
will certainly be good-natured with us, and give us&#xD;
all the fine things we want ; besides, they will be apt&#xD;
to return the compliment; and that: is just what we&#xD;
all like pretty well.!"&#xD;
"I beg leave to differ from you," answered I, "I&#xD;
think you lower man very much by giving him such&#xD;
a miserably weak character. It is only one that is&#xD;

gracefully as possible out of the roo&#xD;

Isa, 'as usual, when I wisi most to indulge myself,&#xD;

A TRUE STORY.              21&#xD;
from the present scene, I could not find it in my&#xD;
heart to refuse her reasonable request, so after a&#xD;
slight adjustment of dresses and seats, I related the&#xD;
following little story:&#xD;
OUR KITTS-&#xD;
Our Kitty was very beautiful, and none could see&#xD;
i.ir but to admire. The fur on her back was very&#xD;
ieng, and of a glossy brown and black.  fer ears&#xD;
and nose were tipped with white ; and to crown the&#xD;
whole, she had a long ring-striped tail. ° We all&#xD;
thought her the dearest and cunningest little thing&#xD;
one ever saw. My playmates, and the friends visiting&#xD;
my mother, were delighted with her.&#xD;
We had a box prepared for her in a room opening&#xD;
from our chamber, with a comfortable little bed and&#xD;
soft pillow in it, though I suppose Poney never took&#xD;
great pains to lay her h ad on the pillow, or tuck&#xD;
herself very nicely under the bed-clothes. Very often&#xD;
at night we were obliged to wrap her up snugly, to&#xD;
protect her from the 'cdld; but she was such a rpst-&#xD;
less little sprite, she would not stay long in one pbgi-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
Kit was a very early riser. She would come to&#xD;
our door just as soon as the first streak of light&#xD;
peeped in through the blinds, and mew and scratch&#xD;
for us to admit her. Then she would jump on our&#xD;
beds; and. snuggle in the warmest conner possible,&#xD;
until, the time arrived for us to rise. As soon as&#xD;
she saw us making preparations to dress, she would&#xD;
make all amends for her quiet by her sprightly, mis-&#xD;
lhevous ways.&#xD;

A TRUE STORY.             219&#xD;
&#xD;
Before we could put on our shoes and stockings,&#xD;
she would begin to play with them, drawing out our&#xD;
garters, which were of long bands of bright woollen&#xD;
braid, and pulling with her teeth the strings out of&#xD;
our shoes. In Kitty's room we had a barrel, where&#xD;
mother kept rags. We children called them baby&#xD;
rags, because we selected many a pretty piece of rib-&#xD;
bon or lace, that had become useless to others, but&#xD;
which found great value in our eyes, to dress our&#xD;
very large family of doll-baby-boys and girls.&#xD;
After Kitty had pulled out our strings, she would&#xD;
frisk about for a little while, then watch her opportu-&#xD;
nity to steal away with them, and put them in the&#xD;
barrel. 'She would then come running back, and&#xD;
jump up and down, to attract our attention. Some-&#xD;
times we would feign'not to notice her, after which&#xD;
she would walk around.and mew again, looking back&#xD;
to us, to see if she was noticed; when she succeeded&#xD;
in finding this out, she would purr and lick, ,our&#xD;
hands, occasionally looking up into our faces; thenJ2&#xD;
would say-" Poney, where are our things? You&#xD;
.naughty girl ! Go and bring them to me right away."&#xD;
She would then frisk her tail, and look while winking&#xD;
her eyes very saucily, as though she was saying, "I&#xD;
will do it again if I have a mind to," and go straight&#xD;
to the barrel, pick up our strings and lay them down&#xD;
at, ur feet. Very often, when we were tying them&#xD;
,on, she would play with them constantly, and some-&#xD;
'times would snatch at them again.&#xD;
:Sometimes when we were sewing, she would snatch,&#xD;
'at:ourthread and work, running away as fast as her&#xD;
little legs could carry her, to hide it. When com-&#xD;
&#xD;
manded to return it she would lay it again in, or&#xD;
laps.&#xD;
She entered: into our sports with as much zest as;&#xD;
we did. If we were playing'" catch," she would runi&#xD;
up and down the yard too, and if. she reached the'&#xD;
fence-post first, she waited for us. When playing-&#xD;
"hide," she would always join us. We would then:&#xD;
say-" Now, K ity, you stand still 'till we hide.'' We.&#xD;
would generally creep under the bed, or behind the-&#xD;
door, somewhere so she could find us readily. When&#xD;
we called, out "whoop !" Poney would run. and .find&#xD;
us ; and when she found us, she would jump up likes&#xD;
a little dog, mewing all the while.&#xD;
We would often say,. "now Kitty, you hide.'r&#xD;
When we thought she had.gotsettled, we would pre-&#xD;
tend to look a long time for her, and when we found&#xD;
her, vould scream and laugh right merrily, whilst she.&#xD;
look ,d delighted.&#xD;
When coming from school she would lie in wait for&#xD;
us behind the door, and jump out so as to frighten&#xD;
us. At times she would be on the stairs, and as we&#xD;
passed by, suddenly leap over our heads, and often&#xD;
alighted on our shoulders.. Then again, she would be:&#xD;
under the stairs, where we kept our school clothes,&#xD;
aid strive.to pull them away from us.&#xD;
Nice times have we had with Poney, and .many a&#xD;
little frolic- have our schoolmates had with her:.&#xD;
Whenever we were invited to play with other chil--&#xD;
dren, Kitty received an invitation,, too. If we swung;&#xD;
she would mew to be taken up into the swing. . If we:&#xD;
walked;.she joined. us; or if we had anything very-&#xD;
good to eat, she also had her share.&#xD;

up into our face, thought we, with her pleased, rogue-&#xD;
ish, smiling eyes. Never again shall we hear her&#xD;
sweet purr and mew. We shall have  .o more frolics&#xD;
with her, no one to lie in wait for us behind the door,&#xD;
weary with our absence, and longing rfc our ret rn.''&#xD;
We could not forgive ourselves- for killing by our&#xD;
carelessness the dear household pet, whom we all&#xD;
loved so fondly. How could we have been so heed-&#xD;
less ? How much we should all miss her ! Oh, th&#xD;
thought was too much to bear..&#xD;

When we found nothing could be done with t1er, we&#xD;
held quite a long consultation as to, how we should&#xD;
dispose of her. Brother proposed we should bury&#xD;
her, as e would anything we loved, carefully and te:&#xD;
dearly. He prepared a bow, and we girls put- little&#xD;
Kitty's bed in it, and dressed her in a long white'&#xD;
robe. While we were decking her for the grave we&#xD;
could not help shedding a great many tears. We&#xD;
could not bear to put .omt little: playmate away froin&#xD;
sight. Could I have had my way: she- should' have&#xD;
been stuffed, and put in a glass case inr the parlor,.&#xD;
where I could have seen. her every day..&#xD;
Brother dug her a grave ih the. corner of the- ga'r-&#xD;
den, and prepared a pretty white stone.. It Was a.&#xD;
very solemn scene to us child-en) and'will ever be re-&#xD;
membered. Satmedy- was appointed for the funeral.&#xD;
We had permission. to invite some of our young&#xD;
friends to be present during the service. Brother-&#xD;
Will was to officiate as chaplain.&#xD;
At half-past two- we all ,assembled in the sitting--&#xD;
room, where lay all that was left of our darling pet,&#xD;
shrouded and coffined, upon a stand in the centre Of&#xD;
the room. As we circled around her, Willie,. witha&#xD;
all due solemnity, read an appropriate chapter in:the&#xD;
Bible, and a hymn After singing was over; hethen&#xD;
most feelingly addressed us, implored us to' take-wan&#xD;
ing of Kitty's untimely fate, and  be' pure" and good&#xD;
while here, so we might live happy' whenGod called&#xD;
us to his home.&#xD;
He dwelt long upon her rare qualities-her love of&#xD;
fun and ir~ischief, her gentle and affectionate disposi..&#xD;
tion, her uncommon, reasoningpowers;,and her soft,.&#xD;

We concluded the service by singing&#xD;

When we reached the grave, we laid]&#xD;

August, 1859,&#xD;
ly to all pres-&#xD;
&#xD;
ent. It exceeded our warmest anticipations. The&#xD;
hospitality received by us from the hands of our&#xD;
brothers and sisters, can never be obliterated from&#xD;
our memory. Many of the guests. arrived here the&#xD;
night previous, and as they walked up from their na-&#xD;
tive shore, their eyes were delightedly greeted with&#xD;
the " Welcome Hom(," which was inscribed ire prom&#xD;
inent letters, and looked out invitingly from every&#xD;
convenien  place. The town was brilliantly illutni-&#xD;
nated ; t e Ocean House presented a splendid ap-&#xD;
pearance. The old Stone Mill, which was decorated&#xD;
with Chinese lanterns, was beautiful as the magic&#xD;
work .of old. The arches on Washington Square,&#xD;
Thames street, the Mammoth Tent, and the triangle&#xD;
fronting the Engine House, No. 3, presented as fine&#xD;
a spectacle as one would wish to see. At the Stone&#xD;
Mill were- stationed two bands, at quite a distance&#xD;
apart, discoursing fine music. The sweet strains of&#xD;
that well-remembered "Auld Lang Syne," and the&#xD;
dearly-loved "Home, sweet Home," which will never&#xD;
be forgotten, but which seem refreshing and sweet&#xD;
as when first listened to, fell upon our attentive .ear ;&#xD;
our hearts drank in with avidity, the enchanting&#xD;
sounds; and when they melted away in the quiet air,&#xD;
we felt ourselves almost too happy in having enjoyed&#xD;
the blessed privilege.&#xD;
The following day, after the Sons had registered&#xD;
their names, of which'ther&amp;amp; were said to he eleven&#xD;
hundred, bearing their tickets of admission in their&#xD;
hands, and blue badges on their breast and shoulder,&#xD;
they assembled- on the Parade, where they formed a&#xD;

band and several societies, proceeded to the Tent,&#xD;
which was beautifully decorated, with n and without.&#xD;
There they were regaled with soul awakening mu-&#xD;
sic, and heart-thrilling song of prose and poem.&#xD;
spoken from the lips of the Newport born, who were&#xD;
only too happy to breathe one more breath from the,&#xD;
sweet meadow of their native air. Soul spoke to&#xD;
soul, and heart-pages, whose clasps  ave long been&#xD;
closed down from the eyes of the world, were opened&#xD;
and revealed to the tender gaze of on another. The&#xD;
poetry of the past, which has been emb4lmed beneath&#xD;
their shut-lidded lives; came up to  heir senses as&#xD;
fragrant and sweet as when first rever ntly laid there&#xD;
by a soft and gentle hand. Outwa d change was.&#xD;
plainly written upon the faces of those who had not&#xD;
seen each other for years; but the festive occasion&#xD;
which brought them together, very re dily freshened&#xD;
them with the rose-tints of youth.&#xD;
The evening passed off charmingly. There was a&#xD;
slight degree of respectful, but unavoidable crowd-&#xD;

from the most gloomy hearts.' The- entertainment&#xD;
was most liberal; and, let it be said t the honor of&#xD;
all present, the fete was not marred b the usual dis-&#xD;
turbances which, accompany the gathering of such a&#xD;
rarge concourse of people.&#xD;
"Hurrah !  hurrah !" that shout free and clear,&#xD;

Her pet names are sweet as we lie on her breast,&#xD;
with the throb of our olden trust,&#xD;
And list as she tells of the playmates dear,&#xD;
Whose ashes now hallow her dust.&#xD;
Then we know the dear eyes that are tenderly felt&#xD;
Looking through their blue curtain of sky,&#xD;
And we feel their hearts glow with a true filial pride.&#xD;
As the baptismal Union draws nigh,&#xD;
Sweet as the honey-drop from the bee's wing,&#xD;
Her counsellings fell on each heart,&#xD;
Sadly we turn from her cherishing arms;&#xD;
From her love we can never depart.&#xD;

you. He was dressed very gay and warm, and was&#xD;
seated on a throne. He had a sceptre in his hand,&#xD;

,if they could have seen it; and his square&#xD;
made much more so by the thick, white&#xD;
wing down to his breat. A bright plaid&#xD;
wn over his shoulders in highland style, and&#xD;
ad he wore al cap with a deep border of fur,&#xD;
early hid his white locks. His trousers were&#xD;

the long, white stockings. On his feet were slippers,&#xD;
of the same color, trimmed with fur, as were also his&#xD;
mittens. I wish that all my little friends could have&#xD;
been present.&#xD;
On either side were two trees of pine, taller'than&#xD;
the mantel shelf, each planted in a large tub, that&#xD;
was, however, concealed from view b a variety of&#xD;
fresh mosses, interspersed with shells. The branches:&#xD;
were all covered with presents for th  young com-&#xD;
pany-simple things-but they looked very beauti-&#xD;
ful. There were apples in almost every variety, red,&#xD;
white, and yellow, with nuts of all kinds, in clusters&#xD;
or single,with a variety of packages, neatly enclosed&#xD;
in paper, and suspended by the boughs. But what,&#xD;
had the most, beautiful effect was a large number of&#xD;
fetters in white envelopes. They were tied with gay&#xD;
ribbons of different colors, and the white papers,&#xD;
with their bright ends streaming over the deep-green&#xD;
foliage, had. a beautiful effect. On the summit of&#xD;
each tree was a branched candle, with the divisions&#xD;
all lighted, and many little candles were hung over&#xD;
the tree, throwing over that part of the scene a bril-&#xD;
liant light, so that at first they did not see that the&#xD;
room was dressed with evergreens. There were&#xD;
arches over the doors and windows, and over the&#xD;
platform there was one larger than the others, and&#xD;
the children grew almost breathless as they read,. in&#xD;
large letters made by evergreens, with the light shin-&#xD;
ing clearly through-" THE CHRISTMAS TREAT."&#xD;
"Oh, oh! isn't it beautiful 1" were the suppressed&#xD;
murmurs throughout the room.&#xD;

quiet during the conversation.&#xD;

'Why, his voice sounds just like Walter's !" whis-&#xD;
pored Charley, quite audibly; doesn't it, Tommy ?"&#xD;
' I shouldn't wonder if it was he, after all," an-&#xD;
swered Tommy, ",for I don't see him any where, and&#xD;
'grandmother looked 'so knowing and pleased when&#xD;
the bell rang.    But we.must be pretty still, or father&#xD;

"See, see "' whispered       Isa, "he's going       to  talk&#xD;
right off now."&#xD;
The sensation had risen to the highest pitch, as&#xD;
the speaker, in a spirited and impressive manner, re-&#xD;
cited--&#xD;
THE MERRY CHRISTMAS.&#xD;
One early morning, as the stars grew pale,&#xD;
Ere'the sun had smiled on the forest bare,&#xD;
The King of the Weather a council held&#xD;
With his courtiers, all in the Upper Air.&#xD;
"Ho, ho ! my brave men ! a herald from Earth&#xD;
Has brought you a message for Christmas morn,&#xD;
We must weave them a carpet fair and white,&#xD;
And the North Wind must sing them her sweetest song.&#xD;
"The curtainless windows, glass-cold and dead,&#xD;
Jack Frost must drape with his silver sheen,&#xD;
Till each pane shall laugh at the flowerets rare,&#xD;
That open their feathery foliage there.&#xD;
"Go whisper the glad Merry Christmas&#xD;
In the midnight's solemn pause,&#xD;
And carry to many a sleeper&#xD;
The greeting of old Santa Claus.&#xD;
"Bright eyes in dreams are peepingS&#xD;

While the stockings their watch are keeping,&#xD;
By the lone and still fireside.&#xD;

The curtain fell suddenly and unexpectedly, and&#xD;
before even Isa could ask a. question, the poet, or&#xD;
hero of the piece was, shut out from view. The buz-&#xD;
zing and humming of small voices had begun again,&#xD;
and already was reaching a high pitch of wonder and&#xD;
excitement, when the rising of the curtain again&#xD;
brought as profound a hush as before.&#xD;
The figure that now appeared was the strongest&#xD;
possible contrast to the previous speaker. From&#xD;
head to 'foot it was draped in pure white muslin,&#xD;
while a long veil of blonde, ethereal as mist, was&#xD;
looped back from the side of the head with three&#xD;
downy plumes, and then fell, with the lightness of&#xD;
snow itself, over the fair neck and shoulders.&#xD;
There was almost a shout of joyful recognition&#xD;
among the children, as they saw, and welcomed with&#xD;
audible murmurs of love and admiration, our favorite&#xD;
Amelia. How fairy-like-how spirit-like, she ap-&#xD;
peared, as she came glancing in, with steps almost as&#xD;
li-ht and noiseless as the snow-flakes themselves.&#xD;
She was touched with the sweet tribute to her&#xD;
charms, and at first could not speak. But recovering&#xD;
voice and confidence, with a most charming vivacity&#xD;
of manner, she recited the&#xD;
SONG OF THE SNOW.&#xD;
Tripping lightly as they go&#xD;
Sing the glad sprites of the snow.&#xD;
"Soft and silent we are coming,&#xD;
Glancing, dancing o'er the sea ;&#xD;

Light and merry hearts have we!&#xD;

O'er the homes and paths of,men.&#xD;
" Gently tap we at each window;&#xD;
But our feathers fine will droop&#xD;
If we linger by the fireside,&#xD;
So we leave the wondering group.&#xD;
"Tumbling rudely o'er each other-&#xD;
Whirling, twirling, rushing out ;&#xD;
Hurried by the North wind's whistle,&#xD;
Madly now we dash about,&#xD;
"We willmake the children happy&#xD;
with our coat of purest white;&#xD;
Eyes will brighten, cheeks will redden,&#xD;
As they round the snow-balls light.&#xD;
"Swiftly glide they down the hill-side,&#xD;
Floating past the cottage door,&#xD;
Minding stump nor rounded pebble-&#xD;
Shouting with a wild hurrah t&#xD;
"True it is, their steps may crush us-&#xD;
True, the usa may part our band;&#xD;
But while love or hope Temaineth,&#xD;
We will hold each other's hand.&#xD;
Firmly we willcling together,&#xD;
For our life is short, at best ;&#xD;
We will strive to make all happy-&#xD;
And in blessing, we are blest."&#xD;

ation that followed this most unexpected and&#xD;
biful surprise, as the    slender and graceful form&#xD;

But suddenly all was hush again, as the curtain&#xD;
rose. This time it was Tommy. He entered confi-&#xD;
dently, as he does everything, but not boldly. Rais-&#xD;
ing his fur cap as he, advanced, he flourished in his&#xD;
right hand a pair of new skates, with gay, red trim-&#xD;
mings-one of the first fruits of the Christmas Tree,&#xD;
and then, with untutored grace, and in right good&#xD;
boyish spirit, he recited&#xD;

it would rise again.&#xD;
ut a new scene of interest opened.; we all fell to&#xD;
ussing the contents of the tree, and what is quite&#xD;
usual in such cases, all were pleased. The gifts&#xD;

derful Tree, which, for the time, seemed to be in-&#xD;

t ran high. Before we could proceed with safe-&#xD;

mittee of Investigation and Distribution was or-&#xD;
zed, and a police-guard set over the children,&#xD;
, in heir 'tumultuous joy, had become riotous.&#xD;

Ie earnest word can find a healthy growth in their&#xD;

nd permit me, Journal, to add a few words more,&#xD;
re I leave. Whenever you meet with a young&#xD;
on who has been supported through all his cheer-&#xD;
walk by a noble aim, and is becoming disheart-&#xD;
I by sneers which sink heavily into his sensitive,&#xD;
nt soul-if you find coldness, which makes him&#xD;
reless and distrust, which makes him timid, block-&#xD;
g his path, show him how Violet fought against&#xD;
ry ob tacle, and at last, with a steady, firm hand,&#xD;
ed the billows that surrounded her, and finally&#xD;
ined the long-desired and long-promised land.&#xD;
himi not to droop by the wayside, though at&#xD;
s the head and heart may almost fail, for success&#xD;
re, and will eventually come.&#xD;
all h m that .labor is good, is right, is noble, is&#xD;
ntiful that only tbirough labor are the soul and&#xD;
y developed to healthy proportions, so that we&#xD;
attain to the full and true power of a noble hu-&#xD;
ity. Tell him not to shrink from the trials of life,&#xD;
to meet them bravely, for his experienceswill&#xD;
g to lim lessons of lasting benefit; and when his&#xD;

Grapple hard and strike out bold&#xD;
With a calm, undaunted eye,&#xD;
Sink not, but the angry billows,&#xD;
