A HOME SCENE.&#xD;
IN a coSily furnished room of a neat house in  st - Street, were&#xD;
a family group, consisting of father, mother, and ""hree children,,the&#xD;
latter reading from'a book in a low tone,- but an occasional comment&#xD;
in a loud one, would startle their nervous mother,who, at last rising&#xD;
from her seat, exclaimed with impatience : "I c.tn stand this no long-&#xD;
er ; I must have the children sent to bed." Ringing'the bell, she&#xD;
summoned' Jane to take them away, that she "  might have a chance&#xD;
to breathe," as she expressed-herself.&#xD;
Mrs. Aston was not what would be called an impatient mother ; but&#xD;
at the close of the day, wearied and worn, her work still unfinished,&#xD;
she felt that of the cares of this life she possessed a large share. Her&#xD;
husband sat with-his newspaper reading ; but the nervous manner of&#xD;
his wife arrested his attention, and he thought of the time when her&#xD;
brow was as serene as the Summer, sky, and her step buoyant and&#xD;
light. "It is plain," he soliloquized, "' that Mary needs more compa-&#xD;
ny, more exercise in the open air, to restore her wonted calmness. I&#xD;
will give up my paper this evening and take her out."  He addressed&#xD;
her, saying "I see there is i concert given at Niblo's to-night, Mary,&#xD;
suppos wehttend. It will do yl go.&#xD;
Nlary glanced at the iy ork piled on the table, 'which at that par-&#xD;
ticular moment seemed to rise mountain high, and sighed as she re-&#xD;
plied,&#xD;
"I would enjoy the music very much, but am so much in arrears&#xD;
with my sewing, that I cannot afford the time. I must devote every&#xD;
moment to work, for the children must have new clothes. I find it&#xD;
difficult to get a seamstress in the house ; besides, it is harder to give&#xD;
directions and make one understand what my wishes are, than to per-&#xD;
-form those duties myself."&#xD;
A shade of disappointment passed -over Mr. Aston's face, as his&#xD;
eyes followed the direction in which his wife's were fixed. To his dis-&#xD;
may he saw the pile of- unfinished garments she had spoken of., He&#xD;
hitched about uneasily in his chair, and finally resumed his paper,.&#xD;
having arrived at the conclusion that sewing was a troublesome thing.&#xD;
How to get rid of it he could not tell. After attempting to read in-&#xD;
tently for some minutes, haunted al the while, however, by the work&#xD;
on'the table at his elbow, the bright colors and cheerful patterns of&#xD;
which seemed changed into so many mischievous elves, who were try-&#xD;
ing to destroy his happiness and render him uncomfortable, a change&#xD;

atlfat passed over his countenance, as his eye rested on an adveatise-&#xD;
ment, and lie exclaimed halt aloud,I' hbye it now.  .le read&#xD;
-'T uT:aonvr &amp;amp; Inat asit   Mo eMnxr Copsaiy, having greatly mci eased&#xD;
tieir facilities for manufacturing their Celebrated Family Machines, with all&#xD;
the recent improvements, otfer for sale a New Style Machine of beautiful&#xD;
And in a louder tone, so as to be certain of attracting his wife's at-&#xD;
tention, he continued to real..,&#xD;
"It is no longer questioned that these Machines are the best in use for&#xD;
family seeing..&#xD;
"But," interposed Mrs. A., " I don't think they will do my sewing&#xD;
well enough. Iam very particular, as you know.'&#xD;
Mr. A., without answering, read further,&#xD;
'"They hem, fell, gather, and stit i 1ii most superior manner."&#xD;
And then inquired, "What n-e c .a you have, Mary ?"'&#xD;
Mrs. A. answered, "I am afraid I have not'niechanical skill enough&#xD;
to manage a macliine. It would be a failure in my hands."&#xD;
" Well, listen again," said Mr. A , "to what I will read : "&#xD;
"And are the only Machines in the market that are so well and simply&#xD;
made, that they may be sen into families with no other instructions than&#xD;
are contained in a-circular which accompanies each Machine, and from which_&#xD;
a child of ten years may readily learn how to use them, and keep them in&#xD;
oiler."&#xD;
Mrs. A..paused awhile, lnt at length said interrogatively,. "I won-&#xD;
der how fast they will sew? I feel that I am getting interested." .&#xD;
In answer Mr. A. read,&#xD;
"They make upwards of fifteen hundred stitches a minute."&#xD;
"But it is so much money to give just for sewing,' said Mrs. A.&#xD;
"Not at all, Mary. I am told they last a lifetime," replied the hus-&#xD;
band, reading again,         -&#xD;
"And will do the sewing of a family cheaper than a seamstress can do it,&#xD;
even if she wor ks at the rate of one cent an hour."&#xD;
After pausing a minute, as if in deep thought, Mr. A. resumed his&#xD;
reading :&#xD;
"Is there a husband, father, or brother in the United Stptes, who will per-&#xD;
nt the drudgery of hand-sewing in his family, when a Grover &amp;amp; Baker Ma.&#xD;
cihine will do it better, more expeditiously, and cheaper than it can possibly be&#xD;
done by hand."-        -&#xD;
Throwing aside the paper, he started to his feet and said, " I can-&#xD;
not withstand that appeal! I must go and see these Machines! I&#xD;
must have one ! Mary, you shall have your evenings, aye, and your&#xD;
afternoons too, for relaxation and mental culture ! I'must have been&#xD;
asleep not to have seen through all this before !"&#xD;
On a fine S ring morning, a few days thereafter, a lady and gentle-&#xD;
ma:.'were tot e seen leaving a house n East - Street, whose purpose&#xD;
might have been discovered if one had accompanied them a short&#xD;
&#xD;
way. But there was no mystery about it; they were going to select&#xD;
the best sewing machine that could be 'found, with a view to pur-&#xD;
chase ; and after calling at the different depots for the sale of ma-&#xD;
chines, and niakimg examinations of the sewing and mechanism of all&#xD;
the various kinds on sale, they decided that the GRovER &amp;amp; BAKER&#xD;
Machine was the one which would best suit'their purpose. They found it&#xD;
simple, its use easily learned, and required no keeping in order-that&#xD;
it would always be ready for work-that it niade a very beautiful and&#xD;
durable seam, that would not rip, if thg thread broke-that (unlike&#xD;
all other machines) it required no rewinding of thread;but sewed&#xD;
from the two spools, as obtained in the stores-that it was adapted to&#xD;
all kinds of thread and material, by a mere change of spools, and&#xD;
sewed an elastic seam, that would permit it to stretch in washing and&#xD;
ironing, without breaking the thread. Mrs. Aston was especiallysle-&#xD;
lighted, that while the machine would sew a.seam that was s dura-&#xD;
ble as the fabric in wear, it could easily be removed by-untieng three&#xD;
stitches of that part of the seam that had last been 'ewed. She was&#xD;
also gratified to find that she would not be obliged to have recourse&#xD;
to the hand-needle in finishing the garments-that the machine itself&#xD;
did it.&#xD;
It was purchased, and Mrs. Aston sat down to receive instructions&#xD;
for the use thereof. An hour sufficed' to accomplish this; thud with a&#xD;
gratified smile, she returned honie in time to welcome her little assist-&#xD;
ant, wj ich was to do so much for her relief. The elderichildren were&#xD;
silent with curiosity ; baby was so muach amused by the gentle mur-&#xD;
. mnripg sound, that he fell into a sweet slumber.' The mother glanced&#xD;
triumphantly at the pile of work on the table, which had been cut out&#xD;
and prepared for the next month's sewing; she seated herself and took&#xD;
the first garment, which was dress for Miss Mary, the eldest datgh-&#xD;
ter, the seams of which were finished in the next twenty minutes.&#xD;
Then a jacket-for Master Fred was fiuihhed-all but the button-holes.&#xD;
Theta baby'sturn cam~tnext, and the skirt of a'little dress was tucked&#xD;
and Ornamented in a style that Mrs. AXston would have thought impos-&#xD;
sible, if she had been obliged 'to do it by hand. Then a Summer&#xD;
cloak-was embroidered for the little fellow, and when the tee-bell rang,&#xD;
and Mr. Aston rose to go to the dining-room, a more smiling, gratified&#xD;
face he had not seen his wife wear for a long time. At table, the only&#xD;
subject of conversation worthy of attention was the new machine.&#xD;
Mr. A., aftdr tea, jocosely remarked : "I think I will make a good&#xD;
;    operator, Mary ;" and seating himself at the msachive, said," See me ;&#xD;
I take hold of the lower part of the wheel with  y right hand, and&#xD;
pull it in a downward direction.  What now? it does not run in the&#xD;
same manner in which I started it?&#xD;
" Well," answered Mrs. Aston, "you do not keep up a regular&#xD;
motion on the treadle with your foot. While interested in watching&#xD;
the needle,the motion of your foot is arrested, and the wheel runs the&#xD;
contrary'way before you are amvare. To avoid this, keep as good time&#xD;
as if you were playing a melodeon : press first on the heel, then on-&#xD;
the forepart of the foot, wjthout raiing the toes'&#xD;
&#xD;
,.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC6793-00000004"/>&#xD;
f                             4&#xD;
"Very true," responded Mr. A.,"the motion, as well as the needle,&#xD;
requires some thought at first. I did not think of that.  ,ow I have&#xD;
gained.that point, and placed my work under the needle, it does not&#xD;
feed through."&#xD;
Mrs. A. cathe to the rescue, saying, "Perhapsye ithave carelessly&#xD;
placed the work on the feed, in a miannerthatpermits it to be caught&#xD;
between the edlenlateand theafeed, which can be avoided if care&#xD;
hoetaeen the pttinethe wok under. The real cause now is, that&#xD;
ye hve forgotten to lower the little cloth-presser, which keeps the&#xD;
work hinlace. Raise it by means of this little handle above it, to put&#xD;
the work in, and lower it by the same means, before you commence&#xD;
sewing."&#xD;
"Mary, you see I am not as apt a scholar das yourself."&#xD;
Mis. A. with a quiet smile replied, "You are doing very well ; but&#xD;
the thread is broken! "&#xD;
"What is the cause ? " asked Mr. A.&#xD;
"Perhaps your tension is too tight. You can remedy that by&#xD;
turning to the left the thumb-screw on therpost which holds the upper&#xD;
spindle in place-taking care to loosen the on the under lile. If&#xD;
loosened too much, a jagged or fringeam th e u  e will&#xD;
be the result. If the under thread break, the cause will be the same,&#xD;
Loosen it by turning the brass thumb-screw at the under spindle-post,&#xD;
from 5ou.&#xD;
r"   l, Mary, you have told me all this, but the thread breaks in&#xD;
spite of tension." Mr. Aston loked as if about to discontinue his&#xD;
lesson, but his wife playfully insisted that e must be proficient, as she'&#xD;
expected to hire him to operate.&#xD;
"There are several causes of the thread breaking, which I may as&#xD;
well state now : Too tight a tension-the absence of a cloth waser&#xD;
en the upper spindle---the crowding of the thread against the needle-&#xD;
hole-the thread too large to lie in the groove of the needle-&#xD;
holethe hrea  toolarg  alloccasioned by the 'vertical&#xD;
and a rough circular needle, generally isot  by se ve-&#xD;
ndcial care should be taken that the circular needle does not get injured.&#xD;
The cause of the broken thread now," continued Mrs. A., "is that&#xD;
you have pushed the needle to one side, and, in its descent, it crowds&#xD;
the thread against the sharp edge of the plate aid cuts it off."&#xD;
4~"A! I see," answered Mr. A., "I suppose I must spring the&#xD;
"needle to make it go in the centre of the hole ; which can easily be&#xD;
done with the fingers. Well, if I am to be employed by you, I must&#xD;
nknow the manner in which you set the vertical needle.'"&#xD;
"Take it between the thumb and finger of the left hand, the eye&#xD;
being directly in front of you ; the outside of the curve of the needle,&#xD;
to the left. Pass it into the little groove in the n lower part of ew&#xD;
needle-arm, about a quarter of an inch under the n    crew;&#xD;
fasten it in by means oT the screw-driver, and then test the accuracy&#xD;
of its position by opening the plate through which the needle passes ;&#xD;
then see if the loopenhich the per thread throws out after it has  .&#xD;
passed through the fabric, and just as it commences to rise, is situat&#xD;
&#xD;
5&#xD;
&#xD;
so that the point of the circular needle passes into the centre of the loop&#xD;
mentioned. Care should be taken to   have 'the needle' just right,&#xD;
as occasionally a long stitch will be the result, if the circular needle&#xD;
does not pass into the centre of-the loop."&#xD;
"Now, I understand all that. I can sew nicely ; but if I want to&#xD;
change the thread? I have been sewing with cotton ; suppose I want&#xD;
to sew with silk,.or any other sized thread, how shall I proceed?"&#xD;
Take the spindle out-of the post ; unscrew the nut which holds&#xD;
the spool iml place ; take the cotton spool off; place the other spool&#xD;
on, so that the thread runs off from the upper side, and  fasten it-with&#xD;
the nut tight on the spindle. The spindle must turn, with the spool&#xD;
, .   fastened tightly upon it. The under thread need not be changed, as&#xD;
the under or binding thread is never.seen 'on the upper side, and its&#xD;
whole office is to tie the upper thread after it has passed through;&#xD;
bat if silk be preferred, change in the. same way as the upper;&#xD;
pass it through the little brass spring, then intl the circular needle."&#xD;
I understand it all, Mary ; but show me how to thread the circular -&#xD;
needle?. I must be an adept."&#xD;
"This little instrument conveys'the under thread through the loop&#xD;
of the tipper thread in a very ingenious manner. It is to be threaded&#xD;
in two places, called the heel and point ;- a groove lies between these&#xD;
two places, in which the thread must lie in passing from one to the&#xD;
other. Now see me: First thread the heel, then turn the wheel so&#xD;
as to bring the point in front ; pass the readd from the outside to&#xD;
-    the,inside of the eye in the po-it; pick it up -and guide it into the&#xD;
groove, before drawing it tight. A large pin or needle will best ac-&#xD;
complish this. Nowlet me show you how to thread the upper or&#xD;
vertical needle : Pass , the thread through the slit in this little post.&#xD;
In order to get.at it, you will have to press the coil spring down with&#xD;
the finger ; thread it into the needle fromnfront to back;- cause it to&#xD;
lie in the jaw just above the needle ; draw it through the eye-of the&#xD;
needle till there is an end about three inches long. After you have&#xD;
sewed four or five stitches, pass this end under the left side of the&#xD;
cloth-presser, where it will-be carried out of the way. The end of the&#xD;
under thread need only be brought to the upper side of the plate, and&#xD;
there left. You will soon learn."&#xD;
" Perhaps I will, if you continue to have-patience with my dullness.&#xD;
Willtyou show me how to take the work out of the-machinie -Mary ? ".&#xD;
"Slacken the upper thread ; cut -it off close to the work ; raise the&#xD;
cloth-presser; lift the work carefully, so as to bring the under thread&#xD;
up one o- two iches, and cut it off close to the work, so as to leave&#xD;
the circular needle threaded. With care, this needle need not be&#xD;
, nthreadeid till the spool is used ill.'&#xD;
.pOn taking the work out in the nianner described, Mrs. Aston ena-&#xD;
ned it carefully, and after the lapse of a minute,.laughingly said t -&#xD;
her huisbanld, "'You have sewed this eseum on the wrong-side ; a&#xD;

side ; this will leave a thread on the under side ; take both of these&#xD;
threads up, and putt them at the same time, in opposite directions.&#xD;
The seam will ravel as easy as one could wish, but if I do not wish to&#xD;
rip it all the way, I can stop just here. Cut the threads off, and the&#xD;
work will be as strong as ever. . While this peculiarity does not'afect&#xD;
the strength of the seam, every samstress can at once realize the:&#xD;
benefit of this convenience."&#xD;
Ah! yes, I see it is a seam that will rip if necessary ; but will&#xD;
not rip when not desired. how convenient that is ; it must be one of&#xD;
the chief merits of the machine."&#xD;
"But as you are going to be an operator, ,you must learn to take&#xD;
care of the machine. Now, as you are going to leave it, we will wipe&#xD;
out all the oil ; then-to-morrow morning before using it, it will have&#xD;
to be oiled afresh with the best cnoca or pure metalic oil, wherever&#xD;
two parts of the machine come together, so as to create friction.&#xD;
The " nipper-spring," which grasps the thread, should be oiled twice&#xD;
or three times during the day. The lifter of the cloth-presser and pivots&#xD;
which hold the needle-arm, need only be oiled once a week ; also the&#xD;
running geer, wheel, treadle, etc., need to be oiled once a week ; one&#xD;
drop of oil applied with a small camels' hair brush to the different&#xD;
parts is sufficient."&#xD;
"Thank you, Mary. I am glad you prove so.patient a teacher. I&#xD;
must confess I was incredulous that you had so good a knowledge of&#xD;
the machine, and to test it, felt desirous of seeing how far you could&#xD;
help me out of any difficulty.I could get into. I am more than con-&#xD;
vinced of its simplicity, and think, with a large majority of people,&#xD;
that the Grover &amp;amp; Baker is the best made, and most easily managed&#xD;
machine for family use, that can be purchased. I feel that I have&#xD;
made a capital investment for saving time and labor, anddgained with&#xD;
the Sewing Machine, an assortment of sweet smiles, pleased and con-&#xD;
tented looks ; and many nesant evenings we will have on account -&#xD;
of the freedom which thebonig Machime will give you, Mary."&#xD;
And there the Machine stouxX, an implement wholly domestic in its&#xD;
character ; but its influence ex- nded itself into the drawing-room, on&#xD;
the promenade, at the church, or other public places, and in the&#xD;
elegant and stylish wardrobe of the family. Mrs. Aston no longer&#xD;
thought that she could not sjare tine for accomplishments. Her&#xD;
music was looked over, and some of the delightful songs of old were&#xD;
practiced and sung in her former excellent style ; and in the merry&#xD;
pastimes of the winter evenings, Mr. Aston's thoughts reverted back&#xD;
to the time when there was " no tine to spare," and he felt that the&#xD;
Sewing Machine had done more than he had expected from it, and&#xD;
Mrs. A's assertion, two years a fer; proved that they were not mis-&#xD;
taken, "for," said she, " if I could not purchase another, a fortune&#xD;
could not buy my Sewing Machine."&#xD;
&#xD;
DjIJR E0CTIONS        FOR      USING&#xD;
THE FAMILY SEWING MACHINE.&#xD;
PLACE THE UPPER SPOOL&#xD;
Upon the spindle at the right hand of the machine-screwing the nut&#xD;
down upon .it sufficiently hard to prevent its turning, and placing the&#xD;
cone part so as to enter the end of the spool.&#xD;
- THlE UNDER. SPOOL&#xD;
Must be placed upon the spindle under the platform, in the same&#xD;
manner as the upper, and the spindle-frame may be raised out of the&#xD;
machine for this purpose.&#xD;
In placing the spindles in their places, care should be taken to hgfs&#xD;
the cloth on the large ends, and the pointed ends puts into the holes&#xD;
made for them.&#xD;
THE VERTICAL NEEDLE MUST 33E SET,&#xD;
So'that, in rising, the point of the circular needle will pass through&#xD;
the loopsof the thread of the vertical needle in crossing it.. Care&#xD;
must be taken to have the point of the needle go directly down&#xD;
through the centre of the hole in the needle-plate, and, if necessary,&#xD;
the needle can be sprung with the lingers ; otherwise the'needle&#xD;
will crowd the work to one side, thereby making a crooked seam.&#xD;
The vertical needle;should never be used, if measuring less than&#xD;
one-quarter of an inch from eye to poiat.&#xD;
TO ThREAD TIHE VERTICAL NEEDLE.&#xD;
- Pass the thread from the upper spool through the slotted post&#xD;
abore the spiral spring coiled around it, then down between} the pro-&#xD;
jection on the needle-arm and the spring, and through the eye of the&#xD;
needle, from you, pulling it through about two and a half inches.&#xD;
The thread used upon-the under spool should NEVER be more than&#xD;
one-half as large as ,'that used upon the upper, as the thread is&#xD;
doubled in forming the stitch. An ornamental stitch may be made,&#xD;
if desired, by using, as large thread on the under-as on the upper&#xD;
spool. Much care should be taken to adapt the size of the thread to&#xD;
the vertical-needle, so'that, as it passes through the fabric, the thread&#xD;
will lie in the groove without crowding.&#xD;

&#xD;
TO THREAD THE. CIRCULAR NEEDLE.&#xD;
Pass the thread up from the under.spool through the eye of the&#xD;
spring ; from thence through the eyelet in the heel of the circular&#xD;
needle, and then through the eye in the point, letting the thread lie&#xD;
in the gioove-leaving about two inches lying upon the platform.&#xD;
TO COMMENCE SEWING.&#xD;
Place the fabric under the vertical needle, with the end resting upon&#xD;
the feeder ; let the cloth-presser down upon it, then turn the wheel&#xD;
{under the table, in the direction indicated by ,the arrow ; to turn a&#xD;
corner, allow the vertical needle to rise about'half an inchfromn its&#xD;
lowest position, then raise the cloth-presser and turn the fabric, the&#xD;
needle acting as a pivot.&#xD;
TO REGULATE THE LENGTH OF TIIE STITCH.&#xD;
Open the plate at the left hand of the macline, and move the&#xD;
lever against which the feed strikes towardsayou, for a longer, and&#xD;
from you, for a shorter stitch.&#xD;
TIIE TENSION UPON THE THREADS&#xD;
Should nearly all be obtained from the upper spool ; that upon the&#xD;
under should be merely sutlicient to operate the spring, through which'&#xD;
the thread passes.&#xD;
TIE TENSION IS REGULATED              '&#xD;
By turning the thumb-nit which presses against the spring which&#xD;
holds the pointed end of the spool-spindle above, and the brass nnt by&#xD;
the aide of the thread-spring below.&#xD;
TO DF TtCII TIE CLOTH.&#xD;
Slacken the upper thread and cut it off close to the cloth, and'then&#xD;
after raising and fastening the cloth-presser, slacken the under thread&#xD;
so as to allow it to be drawn upon the platform as at first ; after&#xD;
which, cut it near the cloth.&#xD;
&#xD;
WHEN TUE MACHINE IS MUCH USED,&#xD;
The oil should be cleaned from the working parts every day (cotton&#xD;
waste is the best for this purpose), then reoil with the best CLOCK oil,&#xD;
wherever there is friction.&#xD;
THE BELT OF TIL EIALANCE WHEEL&#xD;
Somethpes stretches, and the whee will then fail to move the work-&#xD;
ing part of the machinery. It may be tighten d by first unscrewing&#xD;
the thmub-screw under the cross-bar, shoving the wheel to the right,&#xD;
and thin screwing tight again. Some of the machines have the&#xD;
wheel placed within a frame, fastened to the side of the cross-bar&#xD;
with screws, which may be treated in the same manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
110W   TO PREPARE FOR WORK,&#xD;
DIRE CTIONS FOIR SEWING.&#xD;
THREADS OR SILK.&#xD;
The BEST thread should invariably be used on the sewing machine,&#xD;
as the strain required is greater than that which the hand gives, in&#xD;
drawing up the thread in hand sewing. Patent or glazed thread is&#xD;
not so good, as it does not sink into'the cloth readily, leaving more&#xD;
thread on the surface than is deemed necessary, and is very liable to&#xD;
snarl. A poor or indifferent thread WILL ALWAYS GIVE MORE OR&#xD;
LESS TROUBLE. Silk can be purchased on spools, and this will be found&#xD;
the best way to use the silk, as the winding being done by machinery,&#xD;
will give a more even strain than winding by hand. For shirting&#xD;
muslin the thread need not be coarser than 60 or 70 for the UPPER&#xD;
spool, and NEVER COARSER than 110 or 120 for the UNDER spool. No&#xD;
fear need be entertained that THESE SIZES WILL BE TOO FINE, when&#xD;
we take into consideration that the thread is crossed several times ;&#xD;
that it takes BETTER material to make a FINE thread of first quality,&#xD;
and when this is doubled, as is the case with the Grover &amp;amp; Baker, stitch,&#xD;
the seam will be found to be quite strong erougli. The best sized silk&#xD;
to be used for ordinary family purposes, will be 0 silk. The spools are&#xD;
numbered, 0, 00, 000, A, B, C, and so on, 000 being the finest,&#xD;
and F the coarsest. Care should be taken that the thread for the&#xD;
vertical needle he in proportion to the needle.  If TOO COARSE TO&#xD;
LIE IN THE GROOVE OF THE NEEDLE, in its descent through the&#xD;
fabric, it will break. Cotton may be used on the under spool, as&#xD;
the under thread is never seen on the upper side&#xD;
TENSION.&#xD;
The tension of the UPPER thread is regulated by the thumb-screw&#xD;
on the post which holds the spindle in place. Turn the screw RIGHT&#xD;
to tighten, and LEFT to slacken the tension. When the tension is&#xD;
once regulated, there is no need of altering it-for a new spool of&#xD;
'thread of the same size may be put on by simply SPRINGING the&#xD;
post which holds the spindle in place. This is a merit that no other&#xD;
machine in market possesses. Care should be taken not to have&#xD;
the UPI'ER thread TOO LOOSE, as a fringed or rough seam will be the&#xD;
result; but if TOO TIGHT, the thread is apt to break. If the UNDER&#xD;
thread break, the tension is generally rOo TIGHT. When working&#xD;
with silk, a much greater tension can be obtained than with.'cotton.&#xD;
For woolen goods the tension needs to be tight. For materials that&#xD;
are to be washed often, the tension should be rather loose. If in&#xD;
working on Swiss or Nainsook, the work has a drawn appearance,&#xD;
the fault will be with the UNDER thread, whicjill be found too tight.&#xD;

NEEDLES.    -&#xD;
The needles are numbered 0; 00, ai 1, 2; the 00 being finest, and&#xD;
good for Swiss or other line material; ;the 0 is good for shirt work or&#xD;
under-garments ; No.,1 is good for heavier muslins, quiltings, etc., or&#xD;
cloth ; No. 2 is good where the material is very thick. The upper&#xD;
needle should always be proportioned to the thread-LARGE ENOLGH&#xD;
TO -ADMIT OF THiE riTmEcAD PASSING INTO THE GROOVE OF THE NEEDLE&#xD;
in going through the fabric. When sending for needles, the CLASS&#xD;
of the machine should he specified The family machines are classed&#xD;
or numbered 15, 20, to 30 inclusive, on the circulars for the family&#xD;
machine.* Tlse attendant will readily know what needles to give on&#xD;
designating the number of the Machine.&#xD;
TO.REGUL.T1I THE LENGThI OF THIE STITCH.&#xD;
Open the plate at the left hand of the machine, where will be&#xD;
found a lever, stretching across the aperture, which strikes the feed.&#xD;
Move that lever' TowAn you to make a long stitch, and FROM you for&#xD;
it short one. In making a short stitch, do not press the lever too far&#xD;
back, or the feeder will not act.  A very little way will be enoughto&#xD;
alter the stitch. It is best, before commencing to sew, to try the&#xD;
length of the stitch on a small piece of muslin.&#xD;
TO COMMENCE SEwING.&#xD;
Place the edges of the material together. If a long seam is to he&#xD;
sewed; pins placed a few inches apart will answer the place of hast-&#xD;
ing ; and place the work in the machine so that the bulk of the sew-&#xD;
ing will pass to the left hand. This will be better than to pass the&#xD;
most of the material under the needle arm. A little care should be ex-&#xD;
ercised in laying the work on the feed, so that it cannot press between&#xD;
the feed and needle-plate, and that the cloth-presser be brought down&#xD;
Upon it before turning the wheel.&#xD;
SEIVEDGES OhR OVERHiAND SEAMS.&#xD;
Instead of sewing the seam over and over, in the manner taught us&#xD;
by our good grandmotlhers, before he advent of sewing machines, a.&#xD;
better plan is to lap the selvedges, and stitch one or two rows of&#xD;
stitching. In making garments, the seams should lie finished asmuch&#xD;
as possible on the RIGIT side, which will be very ornamental.&#xD;
TO HEM WrTItocT THE hIEMMER.&#xD;
Torn the FIhiST edge down a little more than is done in preparing&#xD;
a hem for hand sewing, creasing it by the nail AS NEAR ON TIE&#xD;
THREAD AS POssiBLE ; then stitch directly of' THE EDGE. Hems&#xD;
turned on the RmuT side, are much more ornamental than the old&#xD;
It is well to observe that these numbers have no reference to the manu-&#xD;
facturers''numerical numbers on the silhered plate of the machine ; but refer&#xD;
solely to the numbers as found with illustrations on subsequent pages of this&#xD;
little bs k.&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
way. To do this, it is necessary to turn the seams for a little way&#xD;
on the right side. To make' them turn nseatiy, clip the edge of the&#xD;
seam, as mumcI as is necessary, to make it tarn well in the opposite&#xD;
direction. If the hem is found to he looser than the material, do not&#xD;
plait it, or hold it in bastring, as is dne by haud ; but TAKE UP A&#xD;
LAiut EI SEAM, sufficient to make it conme even. This is necessary, as&#xD;
the machine keeps the edges even, amd never takes up any fullness.&#xD;
TO HEM WITH THE Hr:MMER.&#xD;
&#xD;
PL ACE THE SLOT that is cut in the Ilemnier,ilder the guage, fast-&#xD;
en firmly with the thumb-screw, taking care that the outer edge of&#xD;
the tube shall be on a direct line with the needle ; take the cloth.t&#xD;
be hemmed and fold up about an inch, as if for basting, place time&#xD;
first fold inside the tube, drawing it. through until the Feed has&#xD;
canglt the goods, after which it is only required to keep the tubes&#xD;
full of the goods.&#xD;

SECOND SAM.-To make the second seam of tie fell, open or&#xD;
spread apart the two layers or thicknesses of the cloth, and stitch&#xD;
dowi the fell at the edge, as will be readily understood by the&#xD;
following cut. This second seam is made without the aid of the&#xD;
&#xD;
hemmer. Select the width of the hemmer to be rused for felling ac-&#xD;
cording to the width of fell desired.&#xD;
TO FILL WITHOUT THE HEMMER.&#xD;
First, baste the upper edge down over the under ; then"stitcha&#xD;
seam the ordinary width for a fell ; open the seam and stitch again&#xD;
directly on the edge. A little practice will enable one to do this in,&#xD;
a most beautiful manner.&#xD;
TO GAThER.,&#xD;
Place COARSE cotton on the UPPER spool; tighten the tension ;&#xD;
make a longer stitch than usual ; UNSCREW TIlE CO-NE whieh fasten&#xD;
the UNDER pool a little, so as to give it full play, without'allowing&#xD;
it to go out of place, and stitch slowly with the machine, as. usual.&#xD;
After having finished the seam, draw the UPPER thread.&#xD;
TO TUCK.&#xD;
Measnre the tucks as in ordinary hand-sewing; place the gauge&#xD;
as far from the needle as you wish, the width of the tucks to be-&#xD;
taking care in stitching, that the needle is right in the (entre, and&#xD;
that the work does not ride or ush over the gauge, as this will&#xD;
make a great diherence in the width of the tucks. If you ind- you&#xD;
have done so, stop hnilediately ; take the part out and sew it over&#xD;
again. It will pay yU for the pains, i the neat and regular ap-&#xD;
pearance of the tucks.-&#xD;
TO QUILT.&#xD;
Tack the silk on the wadding, and mark the pattern in the usual&#xD;
way for quilting by hand. It is not necessary to interline the work,&#xD;
as the cottoncan rest on the"feed withouttinjury to it. ' Use good&#xD;
silk en the upper spool-cotton on the under spool. Quilting done&#xD;
&#xD;
13&#xD;
by hand bears no comparison to that dote by the Grover &amp;amp; Baker&#xD;
Mo-bl~ite.Bed-quilts may be quilted in strips, and seamed up&#xD;
after ards.'&#xD;
TO EMBROIDER.&#xD;
The UNDER'side sho*s the ornamental stitch. Place COAhSE SILK&#xD;
OR COTTON ON THE UNDER SPOOL; use No. 1 or 2 needle; make the&#xD;
stitch LONGER ; have the pattern marked on the WRONo side of the&#xD;
material, and stitch it the WRONG SIDE UI', leaving the UNDER seam&#xD;
on the RIGHT side of the garment. Two colors which form a co i-&#xD;
trast, such as blue and orange, or pink and white, may be used.&#xD;
Flannels can be tucked and ornamented with silk in this way, and&#xD;
chambres 'or brilliants, with boar's head cotton, may be ornamented&#xD;
so as to look better than-the finest braiding'or chain-work.&#xD;
TO CROsS A EA31.               -&#xD;
When sewing cotton goods with much dressing, it may require&#xD;
some care in crossing seams, when there are a number of thick-&#xD;
nesses-where hemis and fells co e together, for instance--the&#xD;
crossing will be facilitated by pressing the seam flat, and rubbing a&#xD;
little WHITE soap on the ThICK part. A small piece of soap kept in&#xD;
the work-basket will be found useful for softening the tough places&#xD;
which often occur in sewing. Many ladies follow this practice in&#xD;
hand-sewing, where the goods are hard to sew.&#xD;
'     TO TURN A CORNER.&#xD;
Stop the wheel without raising the needle more than half way out&#xD;
of the work; raise the little cloth-presser, and turn the work in the&#xD;
manner desired, using the vertical needle as a pivot.&#xD;
TO TAKE TiHE WORK OUT.&#xD;
Slacken the PPI'ER thread,; cut it off close to the work; raise the&#xD;
cloth-presser ; lift the work carefully, so as to bring tie UNmim&#xD;
thread up one or two inches, and cut it oil' close to the wOrk. - The&#xD;
needles will then remain threaded. and the machine be ready for&#xD;
the iext garment. Many ladieshave a small strip of 'muslin con-&#xD;
.veniently by them, which thely run uder the cloth-presser, wire-&#xD;
ot-r RtIkSING, at tlh end of straight seams. it serves the purpose&#xD;
of fastening the threads, and when a new seam is to be commenced&#xD;
the strip may be displaced by feeding the garment under the-clothL&#xD;
presser in the same manner.&#xD;

RELATIVE       MERITS&#xD;
OF THE&#xD;
SEWING MACHINE STITCHES.&#xD;
THE GaoV-ER &amp;amp; BAKTER SEWINGi MAcHI E, although of more recent&#xD;
invention than either of its legitimate rivals, has achieved an unpre-&#xD;
cedented popularity, and merrily hums ,its success to the satisfac-&#xD;
. tion of upwards of 30,000 families in almost every part of the&#xD;
civilized world. Where the merits of its peculiar atitch are fully&#xD;
understood, precedence has always been given to the Grover &amp;amp; Baker&#xD;
Machine for Family Sewing. This stitch his the merit of greater&#xD;
. beauty, strength, and elasticity than any other stitch made by ma-&#xD;
chine-resembling the well known " back-stitch" by hand, in every&#xD;
essential particular, except that it is more beautiful and regular. It&#xD;
Fig. 1.&#xD;
is made of two threads, sewed direct from two spools, just as pur-&#xD;
chased in the stores, and without any rewinding. The upper thread&#xD;
is passed through the fabric, where a loop is thrown out, as the needle&#xD;
rises, and a 1001) of the under thread is passed through the loop of&#xD;
the upper thread, This loop of the under thread, in its turn, has a&#xD;
loop of the upper thread passed through it, and there is thus a series&#xD;
of interloopings of the two threads (Fig. 1),, each stitch being firmly&#xD;
tied by the operation of the machine, requiring no fastening of ends&#xD;
of seams, with a hand-needle, in finishing garments. The GuovERi &amp;amp;&#xD;
BAKER 'stitch differs very materially from the other two stitches made&#xD;
by sewing machines, viz., the "single-thread," "loop." "chain,"&#xD;
"tambour," "crochet," or "knitting-stitch," and the "shuttle-stitch,"&#xD;
sometimes for effect called the "lock-stitch."&#xD;
The "single-thread," or " tambour" stitch has never been found&#xD;
I~2.-&#xD;
of much practical utility for family sewing; because of its want of&#xD;
strength. Figure 2 illustrates that it is a mere series of loopings on&#xD;
the single thread, after it has passed through the fabric. It is formed&#xD;
by thrusting the thread through the fabric, where a loop is held open&#xD;
&#xD;
15&#xD;
until the thread is a second time thrust through the fabric dnd first&#xD;
loop. This'process is repeated until the seam is formed, making the&#xD;
series of loopings on the single thread referred to. This stitch has&#xD;
been much used for ornamental sewing, and there are numerous fain-&#xD;
ilies in almost every part of the United States who relate sad expe-&#xD;
riences of their efforts to apply it to the wants of the household.&#xD;
Figure 3 shows that it has the same defect of the stitch made by our&#xD;
Pg.3.&#xD;
dear old grandmothers with knitting needles. Whenever a stitch is&#xD;
"dropped" or " skipped," the seam may be raveled like an old stock-&#xD;
ing from that stitch. The same raveling will take place, if the thread&#xD;
break, and there be any strain upon the seam laterally.&#xD;
The perfect " shuttle" or "lock-stitch," is formed of two threads,&#xD;
one upon the upper, and the other upoi the under side of the fabric,&#xD;
crossing each other in the centre. The upper thread isthrust through&#xD;
i.4.&#xD;
the fabric, where a loop is thrown out and held open, and a straight&#xD;
thread thrust through that loop, with either a reciprocating shuttle,&#xD;
or a bobbin and a rotating hook. On thick fabrics, that are not to be&#xD;
washed and ironed the looping points of the threads may be drawn&#xD;
into the centre of the fabric, as 'shown in Figure 4, and the seam will&#xD;
then have a very considerable degree of elasticity. Great care must&#xD;
be taken to have the machine run with an equgl degree of speed, to&#xD;
form a perfect seam, as'a faster or slower motion of the foot is. inva-&#xD;
riably certain of, altering the tension ; when the seam, instead of&#xD;
showin  "the s'titch alike on both sides," will, present the appear-&#xD;
ance shpwn by Figure 5, with a straight thread on the under&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC6793-00000010"/>&#xD;
surface of the fabric, which ritay easily be drawn out, leaving the&#xD;
upper thread raveled. Thin fabrics show this imperfection in a&#xD;
greater degree than heavier good, because they have not_ body&#xD;
enough to prevent the crossing point of the threads to 1e drawn into&#xD;
the centre, and the lower thread must, of necessity, he straight, for&#xD;
the two threads are of themselves as thick as many fabrics, and&#xD;
when an attempt is made to have "the seam alike on both sides,"&#xD;
the under thread is seen between the stitches on te ighte ide, and&#xD;
the up per thread is seen in the same manner on the under side, so&#xD;
that to be able to make a fair stitch on the right side, itis absolutely&#xD;
necessary to let the under thread lie straight, which can be drawn out&#xD;
at will. Great care must be had in washing acid ironing garments&#xD;
that have this straight thread, that all unnecessary stretching and'&#xD;
straining be avoided, lest the straight thread break and the seam rip.&#xD;
---               Pig. 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
There.is also a constant danger of this in wearing a garment, especi-&#xD;
ally wherever there is what ladies call a " bias seam," where elas-&#xD;
licitt of stitch is absolutely essential. Even when the "shuttle" or&#xD;
"lock-stitch." seam is perfectly sewed, with the threads crossing in&#xD;
the centre, there is continual friction at the point of crossing,and this&#xD;
friction must wear the threads enough to make one of them break&#xD;
with a moderate strain, when the seam will rip several inches, or as&#xD;
far as the ends of the thread will permit them, as shown in Figure 6.&#xD;
Every "shuttle" or " lock-stitch " seam requires to have the ended&#xD;
of the seam either tied with the ends of the threads of which it is&#xD;
formed, or fattened with a hand-needle, to prevent it from ripping in&#xD;
the manner above illustrated._&#xD;
Prior t the invention of the Grover - Baker stitch, the'two stitches&#xD;
just described were the only stitches m de by machinery, but neither&#xD;
Fig. 7.&#xD;
of them met all the requirements of family sewing. The "single&#xD;
thread" stitch was somewhat elastic, but lacked strength, and the&#xD;
" shuttle " or " lock-stitch," while it had more strength, had little or&#xD;
no elasticity. The Grover &amp;amp; Baker stitch has both these qualities in&#xD;
a very great degree, as a careful examination of Figure 7 must show.&#xD;
&#xD;
The under thread is wound through and around the loop of the upper&#xD;
thread, tieing; each stitch twice, so that every one is securely fastened,&#xD;
and wholly independent of all the other stitches for strength, and if&#xD;
the seam be cut or broken at every quarter inch, the sewing must hold&#xD;
good while the fabric will wear. It gains its strength and elasticity&#xD;
rom the under thread which divides the straintbetween the several&#xD;
threads, and permits the upper thread to compress the material be-&#xD;
tween the stitches, while each loop gives or yields to the force which&#xD;
the other stitches feel, instead of concentrating the strain upon a single&#xD;
point of the thread, as is the case with both the "single thread"&#xD;
and the "shuttle" or "lock-stitch." When the Grover &amp;amp; Baker&#xD;
stitch is finished, with the loop drawn up, as exhibited in Figure 8,&#xD;
the under thread lies flat atid close to the fabric, and after being&#xD;
washed and ironed, has the appearance of being inwrought in the&#xD;
substance of thc material, and when the proper thread and tension&#xD;
have been used, making no rougher surface than the under side of the&#xD;
" lock-stitch."&#xD;
,  The G  over &amp;amp; Baker stitch is formed by carrying the upper-thread&#xD;
through the fabric b means of a vertical eye-pointed needle, where a&#xD;
loop is thrown out as the needle rises, which loop is entered by a cir-&#xD;
cular needle, carrying the under thread, and this under thread, in its&#xD;
turn, throws out a loop, which is caught by the vertical needle, as it&#xD;
comes down again. This seriessof interloopings continues until the&#xD;
seam is formed, which gives great strength and elasticity. The ma-&#xD;
chinery which makes this stitch is a marvel of simplicity anl&#xD;
ingenuity, requiring no mechanical skill to manage. Nor does it re-&#xD;
quire other adjustment than a mere change of threads and needles, to&#xD;
adapt it to the character of the work to be sewed-coarse or fine,-as&#xD;
the case may be. One of the lightest family machines will sew&#xD;
gauze laces, and all the varieties and kinds o fabrics, between and&#xD;
including beaver-cloth, without changing either needle, thread, or&#xD;
tensions ; will sew each equally well, and return to either variety of&#xD;
work with perfect satisfaction,. No other machine ever offered to the&#xD;
public -will do as much.&#xD;
A perfect Sewing Machine--one answering all the requirements of&#xD;
the family-sewing coarse or fine work'equally well-was the great&#xD;
desideratiim of the home circle, previous to the invention of this&#xD;
stitch, which, as we have already shown, is beautiful, elastic,&#xD;
strong ; will, not rip in wear, or in accidentally breaking a thread, and&#xD;
has a peculiar merit that commends it to the especial favor of ladies.&#xD;

The peculiarity re erred to is this: that whenever it is required to&#xD;
remove a seam,  either because it has not been sewcd in the right&#xD;
place, or because it is desirable to refit a garment to a change in style&#xD;
or fashion, it may be done withoutmneh loss of time, after receiving&#xD;
instruction in the proper and only method of doing it. The operator&#xD;
must carefully pick up three stitches on the upper or right side of&#xD;
the seam, and then take both upper and under threads, and pull&#xD;
th  in opposite lirectior, when it will ravel (not rip), as far asade-&#xD;
sired. Whenever the threads arc cut off, the seium, becomes tight and&#xD;
fast from that point, and three more stitches will have to be taken up&#xD;
and untied as before. if the two pieces/of cloth be pulled apart, TIIE&#xD;
sEAM WILL NoT Rir. N    straining or stretchmig will make it rip,&#xD;
under any circumstances, except in the manner named, via., untieing&#xD;
three stitches of that part of the seam that last passed through the&#xD;
machine, and then the threads--not the fabric-niust be pulled. It&#xD;
will be found to be tight and strong whenever the fabric is pulled.&#xD;
This is the trIte test of wear.&#xD;
The Grover &amp;amp; Baker stitch is found to be more economicaithan the&#xD;
" shuttle" or "lock-stitch."  It is here admitted that, in a given&#xD;
length of seam, the Grover &amp;amp; Baker stitch uses one-third more&#xD;
thread on the uldCr spool, than the " lock-stitch," but there is no&#xD;
-waste, and there is no time lost in winding thread :from the spools into&#xD;
the bobbins. Figures 9 and 10 show two spools-the larger one for&#xD;
Fig. 9. (&#xD;
&#xD;
the upper and the smaller one for the under spindle-which may be&#xD;
put on the machine and used up without unthreading either needle.&#xD;
As each stitch is firmly tied by the machine, it is not necessary to&#xD;
leave any ends  f thread at the ends of seams, to fasten them. Con-&#xD;
sequently, there is no waste. In sewing straight seams, one seam&#xD;
may be sewed immledtiaely at the end of theother-the threads being -&#xD;
the only connecting link between them. This bay he do1n with an&#xD;
indefinite number of seams, and they can be cut apart afterwards,&#xD;
without interfering with their strength. It is found that 500 yards&#xD;
of thread-200 on the upper and 300 on the under spool--will stitch&#xD;
107 yards of material, allowing a waste of about one yard by acci-&#xD;
dental breaking of thread.. When a thread breaks, it requires about&#xD;
&#xD;
19'&#xD;
two inches of the end to be drawn on the bed plate to commence&#xD;
sewing again. An actual trial with 200, yards of thread-80 yards&#xD;
on the upperY, and 120 on the under'spindle-gave a result of &amp;amp;7&#xD;
yards of sewing, with no waste.&#xD;
Figure 11 shows the reciprocating shuttle, containing a bobbin&#xD;
filled to its utmost capacity with thread. The machines which have&#xD;
this style of shuttle are preferred by tailors and others on account of&#xD;
the mechanical construction af the bobbin, permitting acompara-&#xD;
tively perfect regulation of the tension oi the under thread. The&#xD;
&#xD;
distance from the circumference to the diameter of the bobbin is so&#xD;
small, that the strain upon the thread is somewhat regular. fnd needs&#xD;
only to be passed through a greater or lesser number of holes, on the&#xD;
upper side of the shuttle, to make a tighter or a looser stitch.&#xD;
Figure 12 exhibits two views of the bobbin, which accompanies&#xD;
the rotating-hook. One exhibits a side view, and the other a view&#xD;
of the edge--each being exact&#xD;
transcripts as to size and ap-           Pig. 12.'&#xD;
pearance, By actual measure-&#xD;
ment, it isascertained that this&#xD;
bobbin will contain 29 yards&#xD;
of No. 70 cotton, and that it&#xD;
will require to be filled seven'&#xD;
times to take 200 yards from a&#xD;
spool. -The distance from the&#xD;
. circumference to the centre of&#xD;
this bobbin equals half an              .   7&#xD;
ich, and  hien, filled with&#xD;
thread, works with some de-&#xD;
gree of regularity; but, as the&#xD;
under thread becomes shoei,&#xD;
and it approaches the centre&#xD;
of the bobbin, there is less fr dom of movement, and the bobbin&#xD;
rotates irregulary-the thread drawing tighter and tighter around&#xD;
the axis. Te loop of the upper -thread must necessarily be large, to&#xD;
permit tis bobbin with thQ hook to pass, through, and, in conse-&#xD;
quence, the first stitch is never finished until the th ird one is com-&#xD;
menced, and whenever a seam is commenced with the " lock-stitch"&#xD;
machine, it is found necessary to have six inches of eud from&#xD;

20&#xD;
the upper'spool, and the same number from the bobbin- -making&#xD;
twelve inches waste at the beginning ; while at the end of each&#xD;
seam, there must be left four inches of each thread--equal to&#xD;
eight inches. Thus we have 12 inches at the beginning, and 8&#xD;
at the end of every seam for finishing off-or 20 inches of waste.&#xD;
In family sewing,. where most seams are less than a yard ki&#xD;
length, it can readily be seen that the waste from ends, for fastening&#xD;
the seams, will be great. Manufacturers who usd this style of ma-&#xD;
chine estimate that 500 yards of thread will sew 166 yards of straigM&#xD;
seam ; but where there are seams of less than a yard in length, the&#xD;
waste almost equals the number of yards actually used in the seam.&#xD;
If we estimate the time lost in winding from the spool, and fastening&#xD;
the ends of seams, together with the waste of thread in the beginning&#xD;
and esdhig of seams, and the ends that remain in the bobbin-that&#xD;
are not long enough to give a proper tension--there will be found a&#xD;
waste of thread and time that will moe than equal the value of the&#xD;
extra one-fifth. of thread used by the Grover &amp;amp; IBaker stitch. An&#xD;
actual days sewing on a lock-stitch machine, with 200 yards of&#xD;
thread, where there were short seams, gave a result of 35 yards of&#xD;
seam and 34 yards of ends wasted.&#xD;
