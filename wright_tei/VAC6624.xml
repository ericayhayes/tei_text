and thin figure. She is the prettiest and the lovelies-t woman in the&#xD;
whole world. The Italians call her Beatrice. and ffI)ow her carriage&#xD;
to get a sight of her. Who the deuce Beatrici' is I don't know. but&#xD;
they do. and some great sculptor cii pied her head fir the character.&#xD;
But the best of all is to hear the bears and ragged children bless&#xD;
her as she passes.&#xD;
- They say sej once was poor in Riome herself, ani. I did hear, she&#xD;
b     tged in the streets.- But anyhow. she made a vw. if she ever&#xD;
had money, she 'd share it with the poor, and her husband showers&#xD;
d un 'iiher. and she :os aIbut dintg good. I'vi- sen I'her come&#xD;
out from a dark street. with a crtwd of children clirgm g t, her skirts.&#xD;
and kissing her hands. and as she turned to ret into her carriage, the&#xD;
sunlight fll upin her. and it seemed to #m there was a ;-#olden halo&#xD;
r tund her head. and I longed to fall down at her feet al worship&#xD;
her."&#xD;
Miss Lemon. -It is fortunate that you did not. Mr. Green, or&#xD;
vi tur friends would have lodged you in a lunatic asylum, instead of&#xD;
allowing yui to entertain us so ,agreeahly here. Pray compose&#xD;
yourself: the rewembrance of thi; angelic vision still agitates you.&#xD;
What is her husband ? worthy of his celestial helpmate"&#xD;
Mr. Green.    aandi*! Oh. h' 's a capital Pelow, a first-rate&#xD;
painter, and a  Iiher too.  He was with Garibaldi this summer in&#xD;
Lombardv: ft uht like the devil, was promoted, wounded. and all&#xD;
that sort " thing, and now he 's coming home for his health."&#xD;
Miss Lemon.   -- What ! a hero and a heroine ? Can't somebody&#xD;

scattered in grioips upon the deck, ar affected in varicu;,- doAzre*ts,&#xD;
according to their temperaments, by these dnrnv influene&#xD;
Glance your eye uor this excellent family m. with hi% exactinz&#xD;

ms;st certainly he shal have hi-s r *,ard, but not from us  And tlP&#xD;
young man [ide him -one look. and his history is read. A fair,&#xD;
thoughtful fate, and cosely brttsned waistcoat jealously excluding&#xD;
al sight of the linen beneath. A clergyman, you sav, attaching t&#xD;
much importance to forms. and tilnirit arI to admit that threoIS&#xD;
an truth but that which hseC se. anI any path to heaven but that&#xD;
which he follows. All true: but look deeper. down through the&#xD;
bugler of black cloth, into the honest heart beneath feel how&#xD;
watdesly it beats to its faster sx rk. how it longs to toil, and&#xD;
Watch , and pray fr all God's children. asking no a     t&#xD;
approval of itsMaker.&#xD;
Glance on beyond this dandy, who  oms to fild his moustache and&#xD;
the effect of moisture upon it. a mot interesting study, as he con-&#xD;
stantlyrecuris what will as ctsta!ntly uncurl. Pass ev.  this&#xD;
wpmmus John Bull. who has come out t: see our basted republie,&#xD;
that he may satisfy himself that where it differs, there it is inferor&#xD;
to his native land, and fix your eye upon this heap of blanket-shawl;&#xD;
aMs Juiks Jone  as she prm-enades the deck on Captain Slang's&#xD;
arm, thinks the eis something worthy o.f  notice here. As she an-&#xD;
prbaches this Spot She walk more lwlry, glances curiously through&#xD;
her black ringets. and it is here that she finds the Attic saIt where-&#xD;
with she seons her jest , the points fPr these Part hian darts she&#xD;
lets fly as she pas-ses,.&#xD;
"Adam and Eve in a Paradise of blanket-shawi "exclaims the&#xD;
far one, $"with thee ceonversingr I fre all time."  Do tell me, Cap-&#xD;
tain, how long they have been in thige aitim.&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
"5.30," answers the literal Captain, taking out a very ornate&#xD;
watch, 'let me see, we finished dinner, say, 4.3i): sherry and cigars,&#xD;
say half an hour. and then Standish, or Adam. as you call him, ha!&#xD;
ha! ha! was off to his wife and the blanket-shawls."&#xD;
Miss Julia Jones. "If they were just marred, it might, in some&#xD;
measure, be excused, but even then. such displays of affection are in&#xD;
very bad taste."  Here the lady takes out her vinaigrette, and applies&#xD;
it to her nose.&#xD;
Capt. Slang. "Just marriedrindeed ! Why their boy, the deuce&#xD;
take him, is 1d enough to be in everybody's way. What have you&#xD;
christened him. Abel or Cain ?'&#xD;
Miss Julia Jones. "1I wish I were as able to cane him, as I am to&#xD;
christen him."&#xD;
This dialogue was rendered more spicy. br the sudden advent of&#xD;
a beautiful . ov who ran between the Captain's legs. alm  t over-&#xD;
throwinz him.entangled himself in Miss Julia'L hoop. and threw&#xD;
himself with a burst of roguish laughter it' the arms 1f our young&#xD;
clerical friend, awakening him from the sacrifices of the ideal, to the&#xD;
vexations of the real world. And he receives this little torment with&#xD;
a grave rebuke, doubtless ? Nothing of the sort. In a moment the&#xD;
little head' is pressed against that severe-looking waistcoat, its&#xD;
cherub-like beauty all the lovelier for the dark background. And&#xD;
when the boy lisps out-&#xD;
Mr. Stone. I want to hear again about Daniel in the den, -no,&#xD;
about tJoseh and his naughty brothers. I mean: I like naughty&#xD;
children bost. And, Mr. Stone, what was that flannel, you said, fell&#xD;
upofn the land1&#xD;
The Rev, Mr. Stone patiently explains that the mysterious flannel&#xD;
(famine', that fell upon the lanl was an absence of bread and milk&#xD;
for little boy's suppers. And while he ij repeating this beautiful old&#xD;
story. old and yet always young and froth, which we have heard&#xD;
with deliht from dear lip;. now perhaps il-nt forever, we will re-&#xD;
turn to our heap of blanket-shawls. Here is a vounz man whom&#xD;
we cannot read at a lance. His left arm is in a shn. his complex-&#xD;
ion shows the effect of confinement and suffering .  wounded&#xD;
soldier. you suggest: and this idea is borne ont by a  enus mous-&#xD;
tache, and something military in his be#arin. But what can a&#xD;
soldier do with those long fair curls, or what cart anybody do with&#xD;
eyes that are so entirely t of harmony with the curs in cobr., or&#xD;
the moustache in expression ? Large black eyes that have a well of&#xD;
fire burning behind them. proud, passionate, and tender. by turns.&#xD;
In spite of Misc Julia's sarcasms. Adam seems strangely necetful&#xD;
of his Eve. who is sitting by him. At lat *tandish rouses himself:&#xD;
1s not this delicious. Ella :# Would it not e pleasant tO glide&#xD;
in this way through life, never obliged to work. suffer. or even en-&#xD;
joy ? The moist air curls caressingly about the alm waters. The&#xD;
fleecy clouds dijspoLve and reunite with a fPoree that is rpose in mo-&#xD;
tion.    A Wy need we go back to the bustling world, where men and&#xD;
thin g turn uponi the creaking hinges of self-interest ? Here we have&#xD;
perfect harmony.&#xD;
-Music that gentler on the Rpirt lieS&#xD;

for a nmmnrit in his face, said. in her nu'st caressing tone. -" Now.&#xD;

truth is. I am rather jealous of your devotin to art, and this makes&#xD;

the spirit of the scene. then u e these f-rms and tints, as nature&#xD;
uses them, f5or symbols of her inner soul. this pictured representation&#xD;
will awaken the emotions of the scene itself. and the artist. who has&#xD;
thus united the ideal with the actual, will find he has painted the&#xD;
real."  It was well fir Ella's patience. that her husband's lecture&#xD;
on art was here brought to an abrupt conclusi.n.&#xD;
" Real. papa, are you tellrig about real things. cause I like real&#xD;

Italian origin. Horace had inherited trom his mother a love for art,&#xD;

Standish played a simple Italian air he had learned from his moth-&#xD;
er. His voice was a rich teiior, highly cultivated; and such was the&#xD;
expression he threw into the wild impassioned words, that Mr.&#xD;
Dalton was for the moment charmed into forgetunss of his gie,&#xD;
and his daughter showed her inexperience by the foolish thought,&#xD;
how tender a man's heart must be, who can thts sing of love. But&#xD;
the greatest aid to Ella was the magical influence our hero's presence&#xD;
exerted over lhpfans and screens. Did she leave her work-fora&#xD;
time. she was sure to find it finished on her return. All those weary&#xD;
hours of toil at night could now be given up, and the color came&#xD;
lack to her cheek. and the dimples began to play again around her&#xD;
sweet mouth.0-&#xD;
A  for Horace. yielding himself. with his usual impulsiveness, to&#xD;
the charm of Miss Dalton's society. he allowed ever thought and&#xD;
wish to centre in her. Cold or preo.ceupied must have been the&#xD;
heart that could have resisted such lve : Ella's certainly could not,&#xD;
and. on his deathbed. Mr. Dalton. won by Standish's devotion, gave&#xD;
him his daughter's hand without a fear for the future.&#xD;
CHAPTER         III.&#xD;
Tir next morning. the steamer entered New York harbor, and the&#xD;
day after, our travelling party. Horace, Ella. little Ernest. Deborah. the&#xD;
Yankee nurse, and Paul. the Italian valet. set out for Boston. Paul&#xD;
and Deborah were fair specimens of their respective races, their de-&#xD;
votion to their master and mistress forming the only point of re-&#xD;
sembLance between them. This verr devotion, too. was as different&#xD;
it kind as their characters. The one servipg with implicit obedience&#xD;
and dog-like fidelity a superior whom he revered, the other using all&#xD;
the powers of a strong will and subtle intellect in the service of her&#xD;
employer, until that service became the dearest object of her life.&#xD;
Standish was silent, absorbed in thought. only rousing himself to&#xD;
answer Esty's questions. repeated every fifteen minutes.&#xD;
 What time is it, papa ? Are we most there How far have we&#xD;
come ? Oh. look, look. papa: what place is this?"&#xD;
Ella can hardly be said to. think : confused images of her past life&#xD;
chase eatch other through her mind. The earliest recollections of&#xD;
her childhood, the touch of a s oft hand which she fancied to have been&#xD;
hor mother's: the boardinsc-hol life. with its little hardships and&#xD;
trials: the stale bread for the pupils. while the mistress rezales her-&#xD;
self with hot rolls and sausages. before their hungry eyes; the cold.&#xD;
dreary hours when the little girls were pushed shivering into a co rner,&#xD;
to make room for the older misses, wh' chattered round the stove:&#xD;
as she grew older, the rivalries. the jealousies, the heartaches, with no&#xD;
one to counsel or soothe her, until solf'-depenadencc and Ief-control&#xD;
taught her sunny temper to triumph over all her schr 'f troubles:&#xD;
the dreadful period of her uncle's failure and disgrace:; her father's&#xD;

Ernest gravely scrutinized him and then slowly replied, "yes, -you&#xD;
are like my papa, though you have put four on your curls to whiten&#xD;
them. - and you 've got blue eyes instead of black."&#xD;
Well, then, since you acknowledge the relationship, search my&#xD;
pockets and see what you find there.&#xD;
Estv did not wait for a second invitation, but plunging im his&#xD;
hand, drew out a box, and at once exclaimed, "Scldiers, as I'm a&#xD;
man ! "&#xD;
Rightly guessed, as you are a boy. Why Deborah, he does&#xD;
credit to y(our training; no Yankee could have been shrewder," said&#xD;

&#xD;
sufferings and ill health: their voyage to Eurdpe, the struggles and&#xD;
difficulties of her life there. Then, with a thrill through her heart,&#xD;
came the remembrance of her first meeting with Horace, the dava of&#xD;
friendly intercourse which followed, when the sun seemed brighter&#xD;
and the air mote balmy: her sudden wakening to the consciousness&#xD;
that she loved and was beloved. Their happy married lH, travelling&#xD;
from place to place, enjoying all that was most beautiful in nature&#xD;
and art, until Horace's campaign in Lombardy: then those months of&#xD;
anxiety, when tales of his reckless daring constantly reached her,&#xD;
and made it almost a relief when she was summoned to nurse him:&#xD;
for, though severely wounded, his life was in no danger.&#xD;
"Boston!- Boston, at last!'" cried Esty, loud enough not only&#xD;
to rouse Ella, but the whole car full of passengers, as the long train&#xD;
swept into the station.&#xD;
Mr. Standish's carriage was waiting for his %ton, and they drove to&#xD;
that much-talked-of house in Beacon Street. which had bee'r repaired&#xD;
and furnished for the prodigal return. Mr. Standih came to the&#xD;
door to receive them, pre:.ed his sn to his heart, then kWd Ella&#xD;
on the forehead.&#xD;
That kiss was for his sn'5 wife : as thv entered the hal. tihe i4ht&#xD;
fell upon her luzhing face and gli2ining e'yes : he turnI andIthew&#xD;
his arm round her, saying,  r my sweet hill, this onu . k as made&#xD;

with great rapidity, adminitered a Iox on Horace's ear, as he&#xD;
stooped to kiss her, ermbr'aced' Ella, and then turned with womanly&#xD;
iretinct to Ernest. snatched him up and covered him with caresses.&#xD;
But whether Esty was anrgr at her salut     to his papa, or&#xD;
whether it was one of those fits t perv'rsity that are apt to seize upon&#xD;
c en when they are wished t b4are their prettitest. certain it is,&#xD;

I a few days the house in Beacon Street began to assume a home-&#xD;
like air: fine works of art were scattered over it, the boks arranged&#xD;
in the library. and Mrs. Standish's morning-room littered with the&#xD;
pretty implements of woman's idle industry.&#xD;
Anna whoe energies were only stimulated by the care of her&#xD;
fat-r's house, the superintendence of a school of design, and the&#xD;
president of a society, that clothed the naked on the principle " we&#xD;
are one flesh, after all, and need one flannel, with a proper wsens of dif-&#xD;
firence in the quality," -found time to viit her brother's establish-&#xD;
mnit't daily. giving Ella manv useful hints, and seeing much to find&#xD;
ult with.&#xD;
Now aV wisest course will be to acknowledge that M.s. Standish&#xD;
was not a good housekeeper, and appeal to the generosity of my&#xD;
femal" readers, to overlook this deficiency in our heroine.. To at-&#xD;
ttnpt to conceal it were to cast a slur upon the penetration of that&#xD;
sex, which is never at fault, when the defects of a pretty Woman are&#xD;
inqetin&#xD;
Te.      it confessed, she preferred her husband's comfort to&#xD;
cleanin; and scrubbing. bright sunihine to an unfaded carpet, and&#xD;
the dut 'f an open fire to all the nicety of ffirnace heat.&#xD;
One morning. as Annatered her brother's door, she perceived&#xD;
Paul c'arrvin:. thle furniture frontlte drawing-room, and placing it in&#xD;
the entry' ''Paul," she exclaimed. " what Italian trick is this ?&#xD;
Put that furniture b ack at once : this carpet must not be swept, I&#xD;

Anna then flew up to Ella's ro.n  " WX~hy. Ella. while vou are sit-&#xD;

became accustomed to the obscurity, I saw a bo about twelve years&#xD;
old lying under a tree. His eyes were closed, but as I lifted him&#xD;
in my arms, he opened them and uttered a cry of pain. A narrow&#xD;
path led from the tree7 which I trusted would take me to the house.&#xD;
It wound about in a most Rosamond-like labyrinth, but just as my&#xD;
strength and hopes were giving out, I caught sight of a light and&#xD;
came to a little gate and gravel walk. My step upon the gravel&#xD;
caused a window to open, and a sweet voice ca.led, "Lorenzo. Lar-&#xD;

"When I reached the poireh, the door opened, and a voung&#xD;

C CHAPTER V.&#xD;
THE last chapter ended with a resolution of Ella's to withstand all&#xD;
future interference on Anna's part.&#xD;
How fa-rei it with this resolution of our heroine?  As do all of&#xD;
the auth rs and most of the reader's: it was broken several times,&#xD;
bt-fore- it was kept once. In justice to Mrs. Standish, however, we&#xD;
must say. Ah- has yield-- oni p 'ints where her own comfort was alone&#xD;

of. Feeling the time had come when she must make Jnna see that&#xD;
her husband was master in his own house, she said -&#xD;
"Your brother thinks that Ernest is old enough to learn to take&#xD;
care of himself: I am sorry you do not agree with him, but this is a&#xD;
matter in which he is better able to judge than you or I."  Then, with-&#xD;
out waiting for a reply from Anna. who stood amazed at this reproof&#xD;
from her gentle sister-in-law, she turned to Ernest, and said, " Come&#xD;
here, my darling, and tell mamma all about it.."&#xD;
Esty sprang to her arms. and burst into tears. The little fellow&#xD;
had gone through much, this morning : he had had his first experience&#xD;
of the rough side of life, and he had borne it like a manl. but, at his&#xD;
mother's tenderness, his heart melted within him. In a moment, how-&#xD;
ever, he wiped away his tears and said -&#xD;
When I first went out, this forenoton. I found such a ni  slide in&#xD;
my mall. - soon I ts of fellows came, -James Brawr , am flail,&#xD;
and NedI Parker, and, cracky! we had such fun i.Then I hard some-&#xD;

thin anl sad-laokin; I was glad he wanted tat play. anI cried, - yes,&#xD;
come al:g, and take your turn.' But Ned Parker - h,  a real nieaut&#xD;
fellow, mamma - called the 1ly a  alxrar. and sa Id he'd gire it to&#xD;
him if he tried to slide : and I said ho should slide, al  y&#xD;
should touch him. This made Ned furious. and he   uld n his&#xD;
fist at me. and cried. ' Yiniou mamnmys baby, you: if Vo hav'.'t holes&#xD;
in your elbows, vo 've slits up your sleeves, anal you shan'* sid&#xD;
any more yturseif' Then they all b":an to laugh at nme, lut I&#xD;
pitched into Ned as hard as ever I oull. I wult n't have minded&#xD;
if he 'd been twice as big : he K' taller than I am. but I lot P believe&#xD;

When this simple storyv was finished. why did Ella pross Ftt so&#xD;

CHAPTER VL&#xD;
A' n flow the winter gaotr b'e'n. Horace entered! heart anal&#xD;

ever hewent, wth hearty     tadw il an' the      I zaltr  of his&#xD;
of society than her husband: she knew she was beautiful ftor no&#xD;
&#xD;
woman is dull enough to remain in ignorance of this fact, but it was&#xD;
to please her husband that her dress was always rich in material&#xD;
and tasteful in fashion, and that jewels made still more dazzling the&#xD;
whiteness of her neck and arms. She was not of the slipshod and&#xD;
curl-paper s'hootl. a butterfly abroad; a caterpillar at home. Her&#xD;
mornin: dress was as carefully arranged as her evening toilet, and&#xD;
Horace often took her to task for the coquettish way in which her&#xD;
little breakfast cap hid her curls from him and the sunlight, and&#xD;
this plavful gallantry from a lover, who had been for seven years her&#xD;
husban. was the only admiration she cared to win or wear. This&#xD;
it was which marde her indifferent to the effect of her beauty, and&#xD;
did much to make others forget it too : ennobled by intercourse&#xD;
with one se single-hearted and so pure, flatterers turned irito admir-&#xD;
ers. anI a1rnrers into friends. Imperceptibly her influence in-&#xD;
creased. and. before the winter was over, she had made for herself a&#xD;
place in sciet which no one else could till. The young, won by&#xD;
her kindn~e  sought her counsel and assistance: the sad found&#xD;
corrl rt in avmpathy that flowed into their heart . without inquir-&#xD;
ing- why iP w  need eI: and the old were charmed by the deference&#xD;
arnd intbrot with which she listened to their tales of by-gone days&#xD;
while : th" :av tiretlies of fashion thse who had not yet learned&#xD;
ti w1 rk or sufer. her kindness gave the best they could receive,&#xD;
the new'st pattern for a dress. or the last novel or review.&#xD;
But for all thi;. Ella was not an angel yct : the wings had not ap-&#xD;
peared. her feet trod upon the earth: and, poor little feet, they were&#xD;
'omeimes vWearV, and wavered, when she met storms upon her path,&#xD;
and th0n the lus of this worlI ,ose and shut out her beacon-light&#xD;
of faith n liove.: and sometimes it was not even a pebble that stood&#xD;
in her-way. but a mere shade - a dark phantom without shape or&#xD;
sub'stane. ecept that which her 'awn fears gave it. She had as a&#xD;
wird to her wed inz rinz, one of old fashioned twisted goll that had&#xD;
b    bmu hr mathr'. 'Denorah had taken it from her rnistress' finger&#xD;
after 4h was laid in the coffin, ar.d saved it until the tiny hand that&#xD;
could '-:y  lurch her dre%. should be Lare enougr h to wear it.&#xD;

"I never was in a hurry to marry you'; Im sorry I ever did it,&#xD;
you tease me so-&#xD;
- What 's this pricking my neck? Here are your rings sticking&#xD;
into me. The twisted one is broken. but it can easily be rnonde-d:&#xD;
at best it was but a poor symbol of your mother's love. And what,&#xD;
my darling, could the slipping ot of this little circlet do to divide&#xD;
us? It took its part in the sacrament that first united us, but everY dav&#xD;
that has passed away since has been a stronger link than this to&#xD;

Mr. Campbell was persuaded to stay a week. in Weston, with his&#xD;

In the mean time an Italian had approached, who, after a few&#xD;
moments' silence, began to chide and comfort the lady, in tones that&#xD;
seemed strangely familiar to Mr. Standish. A moment more and he&#xD;
was greeted by a warm salute, not from the lady, which he would&#xD;
have doubtless preferred, but from the moustached lip of her brother&#xD;
tount Orfano. whom he had knoSwn as a poor exile, and who was&#xD;
now restoredl to his title and estates. The exile had fallen ill at a&#xD;
miserable lodging-house in Boston, and the hospitable rnrchant had&#xD;
taken him to his home, and had him carefully nursed. kmnswing&#xD;

uable as keys to the last. The quick-witted Italian had understood&#xD;
the oI e eTf these studies: and though years had since passed in&#xD;
plts an I intrigues, his gratitude was still fresh. antbMr. Standish&#xD;

her torrune shul be secured to the cent. He spoke first to&#xD;
herdo the sacredness of a dyir; request, and related dreadful in.&#xD;
&#xD;
ST    ISE33&#xD;
stances in which the displeasure of Heaven attended those who neg&#xD;
lected it. -Then he gave his interpretation of her mother's wisb,&#xD;
and Violetta Shuddered at the thought of the convent's walls closing&#xD;
around her. This reluctance he treated as a snare set by Satan, to&#xD;
endanger her soul, to be overcome by fasting and prayer. After a&#xD;
few days of this treatment, the sensitive conscience of the young&#xD;
Co untess took alarm; her unagination was excited at the thought of&#xD;
the required sacrifice, and a terrible mental struggle followed. Mr.&#xD;
:tandish saw the effect of this on her delicate frame, and trying to find&#xD;
oUt the cause and soothe her distress, his love found words: for one&#xD;
momen.t. he pressed her in his arms, and the poor child laid her head&#xD;
uptn hiN houlder, and felt as if there she could find rest forever. But&#xD;
when he -stoiped to press his lips to hers, she tore herself away, ex-&#xD;

Ilti-d in vain to see her again that day : -then he sonzht the&#xD;
CXut, t-1d him of his affection for his sister, and asked his permis-&#xD;

as: and went to his sister's chandler: but, when he returned, he&#xD;
hrg:' 1 his shoulders, arid sail she had set her heart upon iecom-&#xD;
inz the Bride of Heaven, and, as it was also her mother- swish, he&#xD;
could not force her to marry his friend.&#xD;
The nxt morning, when M1r. Saunlish rose, after a sleqlss night,&#xD;
a n te, Ltted with tears, WaS put into his hands:&#xD;
"Think of me no more: I shall soon be free from all this misery,&#xD;

3Mr. Standish obtained a private interview with the Cardinal. and&#xD;
told him all. When he placed Violetta's blotted note in his hands, he&#xD;
saw a tear of sympathy added to the bitter ones the poor girl had&#xD;
shed upon it. After a long pause. in which the Cardinal was~ lost in&#xD;
thought, he said -&#xD;

the Countess's mother. She did not wish.her daughter to take the&#xD;
veil; some fraud has been practised upon her. Will you trust me,&#xD;
and leave all in my hands? "&#xD;
It was not possible to distrust his voice and manner. Mr. Stand.-&#xD;
ish agreed to leave Rome, and return, three months from that day, at&#xD;
the same hour, and see the Cardinal.-&#xD;
After what seemed to him an eternity,-the appointed time came.&#xD;
He was again shown into the Cardinal's private room, and there stood&#xD;
Violetta, who sprang towardif him with a cry of joy, drew back with a&#xD;
burning blush, and turned aside with a flood of tears. Violetta, his&#xD;
Violetta. now gloriously beautiful. he thought, with roses on her&#xD;
cheeks and smiles on her lips. Though the Cardina, had used his&#xD;
authority to restore Violetta to her home, he would do n ng to pro-&#xD;
mote her marriage with a heretie : but Count Orf o had ub scruples&#xD;
of consience, and at last all difficulties were sartbounted, and Mr.&#xD;
Standish was married to the Countess.&#xD;
Mr. Standish's broken words were intelligible to Horace. for he&#xD;
had heard the whole story from his mother: they renewed hL3 gief&#xD;
for her ls. and made his father more dear to him.&#xD;
One morning, at dawn, the invalid opened his eyes and called to&#xD;
Horace to raise him up : he was struggling for breath. Anna, roused&#xD;
from her light slumbers, put a cordial to his lips.  Ella. Esty," he&#xD;
murmured. and blessed them all. Then his head sunk upon his son's&#xD;
shoulder, and that indescribable change passed over his face. vhich&#xD;
shows that death is at hand. A err of anguish burst from Horace's&#xD;
lips, and he pressed his dying father in his arms. It seemed as if&#xD;
that cry and warm embrace had power to aWest the spirit in its&#xD;
fizht. The rigidity of death passed away, adt the lips smiled, as&#xD;
they murmured. "Do you not hear her. Horace--her voice - I knew&#xD;
she would sing in heaven."  And all was over.&#xD;

spring morning : " can't we make a May-day of it?"&#xD;
"A May-day ! Why, it is a Mar-day already, in the almanac and&#xD;
out of it, - a poet's May-day, and an actual May-day; what more&#xD;
can we do for it?"&#xD;
No, papa: only the first of Mav is Mav-day ; I want to make&#xD;
this into the first, and go a Maying&#xD;
"Change old Father Time ito a crab and make hi walk back-&#xD;

" Ten timees fifty twoi weeks ! Why - why that 's ten whole&#xD;
years; I don't understand, "- and a shadow rested on the boy's&#xD;
&#xD;
I-&#xD;
&#xD;
open brow, "Do boys always want to be men. and men want to be&#xD;
boys, and nobody what he is, and everybody something else?"&#xD;
"Precisely so," replied Horace, laughing, "If you were sixty&#xD;
instead of six"&#xD;
"Almost se ,A rpsed the boy.&#xD;
"Well, then, y     svrsixty, instead of almost seven, you could&#xD;
not have desen        state of the world better:" and Horace&#xD;
laughed again.            a puzzled look still on the boy's face,&#xD;
with one of tho              s from jest to earnest, so common&#xD;
with him. he th             d his son. and drawing hint towaids&#xD;
him. said, "My are journeying through a tangled&#xD;

Ernest answered, by clasping his arms still tighter round his&#xD;
father's neck. and, as they kitsd each other. each cheek was moist-&#xD;
ened by a tear.&#xD;
A warm, sunny feeling crept into the heart of both, and, looking up,&#xD;
they saw Ella bending over them. Even her deep mourning dress&#xD;
threw no gloom about$ her: like a lark background to a picture, it&#xD;
gily brought into brighter relief her transparent skin and golden curls.&#xD;
What does papa say, Esty?  Have you won him over to our&#xD;
scheme?"&#xD;
"Our scheme! I yield at ~once. Why, you little rogue, you&#xD;
never told me that plan about .oing a Maving was your moth-&#xD;
er s, or I should not have wa-ted so much philosophy upon it.&#xD;
Never bring either philosophy, or reason. in contact with a woman's&#xD;
will: they lose their edge ,and she loses her  temper." springing&#xD;
up at the last word, and imprisoning both his wife's little hands in&#xD;
his, as if he expected some immediate punishment from them.&#xD;
Lla struggled to get free, and ifrace Opened his hand, looked ad-&#xD;
miringly upon the slender. rosy tipped fingers. and then closed it&#xD;

"Well," cried Horace, seating himself at table. "Juno never&#xD;
treated her sovereign Jove with more contempt. than my little wife&#xD;
treats me ! A regular conspiracy. to cheat me out of a day's work."&#xD;
"ever mind Jove.," said Ella. bringing round cup o'''' df coffee&#xD;

In ani.-ther moment she felt sure that this must be the peasant girl&#xD;

pictures : and yet that figure was sparkling with mirth and coquetry,&#xD;
the embodiment of innoence and joy, while hopeless misery seemed&#xD;
stamped upon the features of the poor creature before her. She&#xD;
stooped down and spoke again. The girl listened with a bewildered&#xD;

"Ella, where are you? Come down and see this beautiful fuschi."&#xD;
A thrill like an electric shock passed over the frame of the Italian;&#xD;
she sprang up. dashing back her hair. and with eves dilated, parted&#xD;
lips, holding her very breath, she listened - as shipwrecked mariners&#xD;
to the cry of land - as prisoners. sentenced to death, to the longed&#xD;
for reprieve. Again Standish called, and she dashed down the nar-&#xD;
row staircase, and threw herself at his feet, covering them with tears&#xD;
and kisses, and lavishing upon him all the sweet terms of Italian en-&#xD;
dearment. Ella had instinctively Pfllowed her to the bottom of the&#xD;

pliablity of her character its grace and softness gone, the strength&#xD;

At last all was ready. She bade the servants good-by, ging&#xD;
each some token of her remembrance. Paul's passionate grief and en-&#xD;
treaties, that she would not leave his master, almost shook her res-&#xD;

wrote on the fly-leaf. -&#xD;
"It is not anger, dear Horace, but -my duty to Esty, that drives me&#xD;

whenever he mentioned her name, to put this book in his hands."&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
&#xD;
A.ovr half war between St. Paul's and the Falls of St. Anthony,&#xD;
but far to the left of the main road. stood a log house. the largest&#xD;
and oldest in the neighborhood. Fine trees'- shaded it, Virginia ereep-&#xD;
ers and prairie roses efiinbed ever its porch : but its chief ornahnent&#xD;
was a little lake. which lay at the foot of the green slop. upon which&#xD;
the h use was built. . This lak&amp;amp; was a gem of the purest water, re-&#xD;
-markAble even amen: that chain of beautiful lakes, which Minnesota&#xD;
wear? qpon her bosomn.&#xD;
In the %h4dy porch sat the farmer, the owner of this broad domain.&#xD;
upon wh 's high land; herd  and flocks were grazing. and whose&#xD;
vlls weyre already green with tender grain and budding clover.&#xD;
Hs dlay-4wrk was ver. and some loving hand had plaoed his arm-&#xD;
chair in the position !at he liked best, where he was -.heltered from&#xD;
the rays of the sun, and vet could watch it sinking to rest behind&#xD;
the lake, ofidin; its raers with ravs of emerald, topaz. and ame-&#xD;
thysine light. There, too, were his slippers standing ready. and ou&#xD;
the little table by hi  ide, his pipe. tobacco-pouch, matches, and a&#xD;
newspaper. Campil. ffr he it was, had just finished reading a&#xD;
letter. which he .tIl held in his hand, and perplexity, rrief. and in-&#xD;
dignaionsvere expr-esel upon his face. At this moment a figure&#xD;
appear I at ti dr. a little firer, on the threshold between chi4&#xD;
hood al idlenhol. Childlike was the plump form, with its fair&#xD;
dimple iaInds andi ar'ms : the mouth too. and smile. were most child-&#xD;
like in thfir swettn.  : but the brow and dusky, brown eves were&#xD;
thoughtful as a wiman's, and the brown hair was demurelv braided&#xD;
so as to encircle the little head.&#xD;
Minnie, I was just wishing for you.  Here's something as&#xD;
crooked as a Virginia fence. Read this letter, and see what vou can&#xD;
&#xD;
14&#xD;
&#xD;
make of it; " and Campbell lighted his pipe with a sigh of relief, as&#xD;
if his little daughter could at least halve his troubles by4sha&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Tears gathered in Minnie's eyes as she read, and rolled slowly&#xD;
down her cheeks. When she had finished, she laid her head on her&#xD;
father's shoulder and said -&#xD;
That beautiful cousin that you told me so much about, what&#xD;
terrible misfortune can have happened to her? I can't understand&#xD;
it any better than you can. She writes as if she were without a hus-&#xD;
band or a home.&#xD;
"lush Minnie, don't cry: crying will do no good, my darling."&#xD;
Minnie tww, from the quivering of his voice, and the moisture of&#xD;
the cheek that was laid upon hers, that the kind-hearted man's pre-&#xD;
cept and practice were somewhat at variance; but she kept the&#xD;
knowledge to herself.&#xD;
When Minnie raised her face. she said -&#xD;
We will do all we can, father, to make up to my cousin what she&#xD;
has lost.&#xD;
God bless vou, my little comforter: so we will. Though I&#xD;
cant quite get the hang. of it, it is evident she wants a home, and&#xD;
sure as my name 's Will Campbell, she hall have it"&#xD;
I will give her my room." Minnie said. her facet growing brighter,&#xD;
"because it is the pleasantest in the house, vIu kn-. 1 can move&#xD;
my bed into my curiosity shop, among my ltwers and beetles. We&#xD;
shall soon make her love us. and fuel at home here. Ernest can&#xD;
wade in the lake, and get water-lihes f .r his motArh#r. and I will teach&#xD;
him to row : and if you will break our little colt fOr hin, we can ride&#xD;
together."&#xD;
Thus father and child talked on. making; plans for the comfort of&#xD;
their guest. unconscious of the dvpth of the grief they hoped to&#xD;
soothe. the utter desolation of the heart they sought to till.&#xD;
Suddenly. Campbell uttered an 1ib*us -But,'' and thn stopped.&#xD;
Quick-witted Minnie understood, and su::ested ' M ther!&#xD;
HeF father nodded an assent. and smoked on. but no longer tran-&#xD;
quilly. Puff after puff of smoke rose, and enveloped I. uth in a dark&#xD;
cloud : and when Minnie's little face cull again be seen, it looked&#xD;
thoughtful and anxious. But, reader, there is a variety of resource,&#xD;
a tact, an intuitive knowledge ot human nature in that little head,&#xD;
which a practised diplomatist might have envied.&#xD;
It had been Minnie's daily task to j in together what must always&#xD;
fall asunder, a broad, generous, manly nature, and a narrow. egotisti-&#xD;
cal, feminine one. But little Minnie never weaned of her task: blest&#xD;
is the home with such a peacemakr.&#xD;
As the last wreath of smoke died away. Minnie timidly said. MY&#xD;
Cousin Ella -is she n4t very aceomnplishedJ. I remember you told&#xD;
me they sang so beautifully, she and her&#xD;
Minnie stopped in confusion -n.&#xD;
*Well, child, what of it ?"&#xD;
" Why, mother, you know, says she does not care a straw for&#xD;
Latin and German, ~and all the other things Mr. Talbot has taught&#xD;
me, and site wants mne so much to have music lessons. Cousin Ela&#xD;
might teach me.'&#xD;
" This is going education rather to" strong," cried Campbell,&#xD;

" See if I can't! I shall soon come back, bringing my rival in my&#xD;
arms:" and she vanished,, feeling that the gentlemea could talk&#xD;
over her cousin's letter more freely in her absence.&#xD;
In a quarter of an hour, she returned with a. pitcher of foaming&#xD;
sillibub. After they had drank and praised it, agreeing that she&#xD;
must feel great confidence in their regard to dare introduce such a&#xD;
competitor for it, Mr. Talbot said -&#xD;
"Now, Minnie, I will tell you what you are longing to hear. We&#xD;
have talked this sad affair over, and decided that the best course is&#xD;
to speak - the last thing a woman ever thinks of."&#xD;
"What you know you are nit speaking now," and Minnie held up&#xD;
a little white finger reprovingly.&#xD;
The satirical smile (.u Mr. Talb''s lip changed to a very sweet one&#xD;
as he sail, "I deserve your reproof, Minnie, but still I wean to keep&#xD;
you a child as lorng as possible "&#xD;
But.' Minnie persisted. "wihat is the truth in this case ? my&#xD;
c using's letter is so confused, we really kniw nOhinr."&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
&#xD;
WTra a heavy heart, Minnie watched Mr. Talbot until he disap-&#xD;
peared, tryig to gather courage to tell her mother of their expected&#xD;
guests, and bear the first violence of the storm that she knew would&#xD;
follow the announcement. Poor little thing, I am afraid she will&#xD;
never make a strong-minded woman ! She shrunk from the thought&#xD;
of giving and of receiving pain, and longed to run and, hide herself&#xD;
in the hollow of the old willow tree until all was settled. But then&#xD;
she could not let her father suffer a pang which she was able to save&#xD;
him from. And Mr. Talbot would be so ashamed of his pupil if he&#xD;
saw her hesitation: he who, if he had a disagreeable duty to per-&#xD;
form* waited only to see how it could best be done. She would go&#xD;
that moment, and she took two steps forward, - then stopped, with&#xD;
the thought. "it is so much harder for a woman to be resolute than&#xD;
a man. and I am not even a woman yet."&#xD;
But this feeling of childlike weakness was Minnies strength:&#xD;
from the days of her infancy. there had lived in her imagination a&#xD;
majestic fi;.ure clothed i purple. The glorious halo that encircled&#xD;
his brow dazzled her, so that she could not see the upper part of&#xD;
that divine face, but the mouth with its tender smile seemed to say&#xD;
to her. " do nit doubt my love: did I not give my life for you?&#xD;
Come. lean on me, and you need never feel too weak to choose the&#xD;
right, however hard it may seem.. With a feeling of self-reproach&#xD;
for her momentary forgetfulness, she turned to her Heavenly Guide;&#xD;
an arm was stretched out, and at the firm and gentle touch, she felt&#xD;
that strength was given to her for her task.&#xD;
3m. Campbell was in the kitchen, preparing tea.&#xD;
"   .Oh! 't me help you. mother," said Minnie:  you know I can&#xD;
cut bread as nicly as' you now. Where is Sally?&#xD;
"Where, indeed, the idle hussy! I told her. as soon as she&#xD;
had cleared away. to take some of the cold chicken and a bowl&#xD;
of rice milk to 'Jessie May. You know Mr. Talbot said she was&#xD;
suffer, fir want of nourishing food. W ell, 't was easy enough to&#xD;
see she had n't a mind fir the walk. 'First, she said she had her dairy&#xD;
foor to scrub. then. that Reilly passed by Mrs. May's cottage on his&#xD;
way hern, and that he mirht take it. XWhen I insisted upon it, that&#xD;
she should scrub her dairy floor first, and go afterwards. she took&#xD;
twice as long as she need at the dairy, and, as she was going. looked&#xD;
in at the parlor door to ask who would get tea if she wa n't back in&#xD;
time, Thiis is always the way : as soon as one gets a servant trained&#xD;
to their ways,. they begin to give trouble: there 's no gratitude in&#xD;
'em. The pains I have taken with that girl! She was so ignorant&#xD;
when she came to me. she could n't wash a dish clean."&#xD;
Ueetiwradbl it be, to follow Mrs. Campbell through the whole&#xD;
of her tirade against servants in general, and Sglly in particular. and&#xD;
quite as useless to have suggested, that no amount of gratitude on&#xD;
Sally s part. could annihilate the mile of solid earth that separated the&#xD;
Lakewood farmhiose from widow Mar's cottage.  Minnie spread&#xD;
&#xD;
14'&#xD;
&#xD;
and cut the bread with skilful fingers, and listened in silence, until&#xD;
her mother paused for breath, then she answered, gently -&#xD;
" It was very kind in you, mother, to think of Jessie to-day. I&#xD;
dare say she is feasting on the chicken now.  Father will be very&#xD;
willing to wait for tea, when he knows the reason."&#xD;
" Willing to wait," cried Mrs. Campbell, who had recovered her&#xD;
breath: "ves, of course he will be! 'He is always willing to wait, and&#xD;
tells me ifI would n't scold and complain so much, all would go well.&#xD;
I might slave myself to death. and he 'd never wake up to thank me, or&#xD;
find out that I was doing anythincr. Well, the time will co 'me when I&#xD;
shall be worn out:" (if predicting one's death, led to preparing for&#xD;
it. what good Christians Mrs. Campbell and women of her class would&#xD;
beceme : 4' and I hope she that comes after rme will take him at his&#xD;
word. a'id smile sweetly, and sit in the parlor, waiting for the dinner&#xD;
to cook itself. and the cream churn into butter. and the dirty clothes&#xD;
turn inti.# clean."&#xD;
I am ure father knows he c;'uld not gc-t on f-r a day without vou,&#xD;
dear mother, and he wants to consult you now about a little matter.&#xD;
MV cousin Ella has met with some dreadful misfortune. She has left&#xD;
her home in Boston, and, with her little boy, and old nurse. begs a&#xD;
shelter from us, until she can make some plans for the future.&#xD;
"What, here! come here!" exclaimed Mrs. Camnbell. in her&#xD;
sharpest key. They must sleep in the barn, then. I have bat one&#xD;
spare room, and that is for strangers.  Your father invites every&#xD;
traveller he sets his eyes on. to pass the night, and yet he would n't&#xD;
leave me a place to put em in."&#xD;
11I will give up m 'y ro,-om,_ mother. You&#xD;
" Not to be thought of for a moment : but it would be just like&#xD;
your father to let yo-)u do it His usual style of benevlence. - turn&#xD;
his own child out of doors, to take in the daughter of a man that&#xD;
despised him. I remember very well - river P irget such thiap&#xD;
-how Mr. Daltn treatted him when he wrote to offer him all he&#xD;
had laid by. at the time his brother made that disgraceful smash-up!"&#xD;
" Mother you know how anxious you are to have me take music&#xD;
.." '&#xD;
"Certainly I am; I would give more f ir it than all the strange&#xD;
learning Mr. Talbot has taught you, Latin. and German. and Geom-&#xD;
etry, and things whose names I can't remember. and that a lady has&#xD;
no- business to meddle with.  But what 's that to do with the&#xD;
matter:'&#xD;
"Co usin Ella is a very fine musician. You know she lived several&#xD;
years in Europe, and toAk lessons there.&#xD;
"Can she speak French and Italian'!&#xD;
Father said, when he came from Boston, that they all. even little&#xD;
Ernest. spoke Italian and French as easily as English."&#xD;
" Then we might make her useful for a'time. These are the things&#xD;
to make a Laly of you. But the nurse and the box. - we can't get&#xD;
along with them: your father must write her to leave them behind.&#xD;
" It is too late to do that now." said Mnne. gently, though her&#xD;
heart beat very fast. " They are at Brown's hotel, at St. Paul's, and&#xD;
we must send for them early to-morrow.&#xD;
" Gracious goodness me!"&#xD;
Astonishment deprived Mrs. Campbell of the power to say more.&#xD;

By this bold stroke Minnie had won the citadel; she had made her&#xD;
mother look upon the arrival of the travellers as inevitable on the fol-&#xD;
lowing tLv. and she now secured her advantage by entering into all the&#xD;
domet%ic arrangements, which must necessarily be made. Bread to&#xD;
bake, more coffee to be roasted, and their beds, - where should they&#xD;
sleep? In vain Mrs. Campbell raised difficulty after difficulty,&#xD;
slight barriers of resistance. now the fortress was gained. With un-&#xD;
ruffled sweetness, Minnie overcame them, one after the other. until at&#xD;
last her mother, weary with objecting, went to toed, ready to rise with&#xD;
the first dawn and provide for the comfort of her guests.&#xD;

Ella's establishment at Likewoiio,l. The waters of the little lake&#xD;
seemed !e.srklinzr with jy, nor was the lawn l s brilliant with its&#xD;
diamond--tudlel c eowebs andg clden butterrups. 'V1e birds too&#xD;
were sin ig their mnorning song of thanks1ivm1. as the family bent&#xD;
their stips towards tue little church. Their road wa, 'ver an undu-&#xD;
lating rw-alw dotted with gr ves of sugar maple. ash. and birch.&#xD;
The church sto 4i upon a plateau. several feet above the road. It&#xD;
was shadlel ,n the riht ly what seemed an oaken grove : but, upon&#xD;
nearer view. this proved to be a single tree. the monarch of the&#xD;
forest : while. ion the other side, two elms with urn-shaped trunks,&#xD;
stood in sisterly emlrace, bowing their heads with soft normurs to&#xD;
every breeze Iit raising them azainm unstrippedl of a single leaf.&#xD;
The c-hur''h itself was a simple wooden building. paintel brown.&#xD;
But whei Ella reached the pireh anl Ielked in. iIItevadl tf the bare&#xD;
benches. r 'uzh floor, and whitewashed walls she expected. here&#xD;
was a beautiful little chapel, th- harmony and perfection if every&#xD;
part making it worthy to be callo-d the hou- of God. The ceiling&#xD;
was painted in fresco. the wind' ws were sof richly stained glass, the&#xD;
floor of Italian tiles. and the pulpit. altar, and seats, - there were no&#xD;
pews. i-f carvel oak-&#xD;
Beautiful, is it not? (whispered Minniei: The parish built the&#xD;
church. b'ut Mr. Tallbot sent abr il for the windows and tiles ; and&#xD;
a poor fioreigner. whom he ha'! a ited, proved to be a skilfud carver&#xD;
in wood, and out of gratitude to him took so much pain, with these&#xD;
seats."&#xD;
Yes," said Ella, " the interior is beautiful. in pprfoct taste. I&#xD;
have never seen in this country any windows si nchly painted as&#xD;
these. Mr. Talbot is a man of fortune, I suppose ?&#xD;
" I don't know. lie spends more than iis salary in the parish,&#xD;
father says: but he never seems to have tny wants himself."&#xD;
"I wonder he did not build yon a little stone church at once."&#xD;
"Why, you see, niece." said Mr. Campbell: "Mr. Talbot 's real&#xD;
cute. He aint one of those innocent clergymen, that seem as if&#xD;
&#xD;
they 'd always fed on their mother's milk. He knew that, to make us&#xD;
value our church., we must all have a share in building it. *We.e4,'&#xD;
he said to the parish, 'you take the outside, and I'll take the in-&#xD;
side ;' and so he did, regardless of expense !"&#xD;
Mr. Talbot's voice was naturally fine, but he had cultivated it un-&#xD;
til its varying tones expressed his feelings as readily as his thoughts&#xD;
clothed themselves in language. That solemn appeal, "When the&#xD;
wicked man turneth away from his wickedness, and doeth that -which&#xD;
is lawful and right," coming from his lips, awoke the conscience and&#xD;
forced the acknowledgment, '-I have sinned: and while there is&#xD;
time to repent, let me turu to the Lord, my God." When he knelt&#xD;
in the eonfession. the fervent supplication of his tone. sail as plainly&#xD;
as worls. "pardon we all nee'd: bt as my responsibilities have&#xD;
been the greatest. so have my errors been." But when he declared&#xD;
the absolution of sins to such as truly repented, it was no longer the&#xD;
.iniful man who spoke : a priest 4f Go.d, in the authority of his holy&#xD;
Office. his voice full and clear, tilled the little church, and carried&#xD;
peace to every troubled soul.&#xD;
An irv oppression had weigh.!i upon Ella's heart  er zinee she&#xD;
former her resolution to exile herself from LirHac that day of&#xD;
suffering and temptation. She oild find no relief im words. or&#xD;
groans. or tears : every feeling seemed frozen within her. Where&#xD;
was the sympathy that iad dimpriled her mouth with smiles, or&#xD;
[rouzht the flush to her cheek at every kindly word and generous&#xD;
deed . Had she, who could weep so readily for others. not one tear&#xD;
to spare for her own grief?  Worse than all, one who had such&#xD;
need of prayers, found that her suppiications were mere words of&#xD;
form, cold and lifeless. Whnu she hail turned from her earthly&#xD;
paradise. b'ecaus'e its enj4yments were no longer innocent, the gates&#xD;
"f heaven semed to have clszd against her.&#xD;
Now, in this little church, she 1ekran to feel a snftenin induence.&#xD;
Tear after tear rolled slowly down her cheek. each carrying with it&#xD;
a load of icygnref, until her spirit seemed to rise into a liirher life,&#xD;
to enryv a s.rt f dIfoble consciou'ne. to l k wi:h e*mpassion&#xD;
upon the Ileeding heart beneath it. and liw with gratitude towards&#xD;
Ilm. who had worn the crown itf thornsi , and, through the extremity&#xD;
t human i;uffering. had made his humanity divine.&#xD;

last iness. He indulged me in my boyhood in every reasonable&#xD;
wish, but his manner towards me was cold and reserved; while&#xD;
money-making, an occupation for *hich I had no sympathy, seemed&#xD;
to me the object of his life. Heaven forgive me the injustice I did&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"-My mother, Ella, was so different from you. that I hardly know,&#xD;
how to make you understand her character. She had none of your&#xD;
variety, playfuluess, or strength. She was an Italian, all passion&#xD;
and tenderness.  11er husband and child were her world: she&#xD;
lived but for them, and her intellect acted only through her affec-&#xD;
tions.  Song was her natural language, and- her voice had great&#xD;
influence over me. My earliest recollections are of the gusts of pas-&#xD;
sion that would seize me when my will was opposed. Frightened&#xD;
at my own violence, I ran instinctively to my mother, who would&#xD;
take me in her arms and sine to me some sweet hymn. Her voice&#xD;
would completely subdue me. and my tightly clenched fists would&#xD;
open and cl.sp her neck. Thent he seized the moment to tell me&#xD;
of great and otr'od men who hal struggled with their passions and&#xD;
learned to sulblue them, until I 1,.nged to follow their example and&#xD;
conqu.-r myelf.&#xD;
" But to go on with my tale. I yielded to a desire to visit again&#xD;
my mother s 'i rtliplace, and went to Italy.  Here I wandered&#xD;
about, with dute and sketch-book. liing among the peasantry, and&#xD;
finding a welcome in every cottage.  My music so opened their&#xD;
hearts to me that it was difficult ti make them take any return for&#xD;
their hospitality: A  I ysurn.-yeId suthward, I constantly said to*&#xD;
myself, - One(lay more of warm sunhine : one day more of cloudless&#xD;
sky. and then I will stop, return rapidly to Germany, and make up by&#xD;
my diligence for the time I have waste 1.' But, every day, the scene&#xD;
became more glowing and impanis ned: the flowers mrnsre beautiful&#xD;
in their tints. the fruits of more deleciss flavor. It was Septenber.&#xD;
the time of the vintage: as I write, the whole scene rises vividly&#xD;
before me. In the distance. the mountains, with snow-covered tops,&#xD;
their sides cl.,thed with ma; n er t rests f oak and chestnut, and&#xD;
near. on every side. heds attus groves of orange and lemon&#xD;
trees, and vines, ladent with puirp e fruit, wreathing the mulberries&#xD;
in rich festoons. I threw myself d )wn under a tree to rest, and drink&#xD;

Abe sky, around me the osft green of the foliage:; the well-sustained&#xD;
vintage chorus came t4' my tar. minAed with the song of the birds.&#xD;
Every sense was 'stevped in 'rrjsyment. when I was startled by a&#xD;
sound jns~t beland me. A lau.Th. and then some broken snatches of&#xD;
song. The vice was so jyul that, repeating to myself--..&#xD;

quisite symmetry, and at last through the leaves aface. 1la, you&#xD;
have seen it in its misery, the eyes quenched in tears, the feature rigid&#xD;
with suffering, and yet thought it beautiful. But no words can de.&#xD;
scribe it as it then was. Coquettish, vivacious, innocent, joyful ! the&#xD;
full lips parted showed teeth of dealing whiteness: it was a face in&#xD;
harmony with the voice. I was unperceived, and, opening my port-&#xD;
folio, rapidly sketched the group before me. At last the boy turned&#xD;
round, saw'me, and gave the alarm to his sister. who swung herself&#xD;
to the ground, and stood under the tree, blushing and hesitating.&#xD;
Curiosity drew her to my side, where her brother was wondering at&#xD;
my sketch, and timidity held her back. How lovely she looked!&#xD;
y life among the peasants had made me so familiar with their habits&#xD;
and expressions, that I soon made the girl feel at ease with me, and.&#xD;
seated at my feet, she let me finish the sketch at my leisure. A boy&#xD;
of eighteen and a girl of fourteen soon become friends, all the wcrld&#xD;
over; under vJtalian skies, they still more rapidly become lovers.&#xD;
This morning I had felt sad and lonely. My senses were intoxicated&#xD;
by the beauty that surrounded me, but my heart was unsatisfied.&#xD;
But when the'day drew to a close, I was helping Pedro bear home&#xD;
his heavy-laden basket, while his sister Letta carried my flute and&#xD;
portfolio, and as I saw the girl's eyes droop thoughtfully under mine.&#xD;
my heart seemed to have caught the gayety I had banished from hers.&#xD;
.. I was hospitably received by Letta's mother, whose language&#xD;
and manners were more reined than is usual in her class of life. My&#xD;
wish to make an oil painting of my sketch. furnished me with an&#xD;
excuse for remaining.&#xD;
" When I sat down to work on my picture. Letta moved about the&#xD;
cottage with a light step. assisting her mother in her household oc-&#xD;
cupations : but, at a word or look from me. she was by my side, con-&#xD;
cealing under a thousand little coquetries the pleasure she felt in&#xD;
being near me. In vain would I tell her to hold up her arm as if she&#xD;
were gathering grapes: that beautiful arm could assume an endless&#xD;
variety of attitudes, but never the right one. until feiging a dis-&#xD;
pleasure I was far from feeling. I would begin to put away my&#xD;
brushes and paints. Then her penitence was bewitching : she would&#xD;
kneel by my side, press her lips to my hand, and tell me how good&#xD;
Letta was going to be, and how bright. tso. for she was c'oing to un-&#xD;
derstand all I told her to do. S.eing me incredulous, she would&#xD;
spring up, put herself into exactly the right attitude. throw into her&#xD;
face the arch vivacity I had first seen there, and, for tifteen minutes,&#xD;
no artist ever had a better model. Then, glancing at the picture, she&#xD;
would exclaim, 'oh, you will get it done too soon.' and run away.&#xD;
" When her work was over. and Letta put on her holiday bodice.&#xD;
and bright-colored skirt. her beauty was heightened by her costume&#xD;
every hour her expression grew softer ani more impassioned, and&#xD;
her sighs were now dearer to me than her smiles. I found it delight-&#xD;
ful to support her beautiful form in the waltz, or join my voice with&#xD;
hers in the simple songs she loved.&#xD;
"Such were the days of my first love, Dlla. - days of bewildering&#xD;
delight. Frankly I tell you all: but you have no cause for jealousy :&#xD;
my senses were'entranced, but not my soul. You have often re-&#xD;
marked the miniature-like finish of this picture of the vintage. Per-&#xD;
haps you will wonder now that I never answered. your questions&#xD;

great effort, I had conquered : it took a more subtle form, and I&#xD;
yielded to it without a struggle. As I drew near the cottage, my&#xD;
heart beat with joy, at the thought of holding Violet once more in&#xD;
my arms.   I hurried up a narrow path shaded by shrubbery, and&#xD;
obscure, in the dim morning light. My foot touched a body stretched&#xD;
upon the ground. I stoe,d. and found it was the senseless form of&#xD;
Vilet, the bloodI gushing from a slliht wound in her forehead, cut&#xD;
by a stonre upn which she had fallii. I raised her, wiped the cut,&#xD;
and pressed the edges carefully together with some court plaster, ex-&#xD;
pecting1 each moment that her eyes w.uld open. and her lips smile their&#xD;
thanks: but she remained unco1nsieus. I felt her heart, to assure&#xD;
myself that it still beat. and my hand was drenched in bl1.d. Now&#xD;
really alarmed fr Vi o-t*s lif. I hastily unlaced her bodice, and&#xD;
drew out a :-wall stile'tt, froin her sie-je. bo1,und the wopund with my&#xD;
handke'rchwf. and carried th-- por chi. Utoo the h use, and laid her&#xD;
on her own bedl.  When sht-,pened her eyes, she saw only her&#xD;

were ghastly pale : joy toek the place of despair : she clasped her&#xD;

coans hetyalr virtue, was sure to rouse Letta's jealousy, and&#xD;
cause her e nsar a man ner of ftspiteful things against her whom she&#xD;
choe t  ~sier  rial  Ifths be an attribute of womankindj, I&#xD;
&#xD;
cannot be too thankful, my darling, that there is more of the angel&#xD;
than the woman in your composition. Letta's jealousy did not even&#xD;
conline itself to her own sex; my favorite anthor, my brushes, even&#xD;
my letters, were snatched from my hands that I might look at my&#xD;
Violet, and you cannot wonder that, after this process, I was much&#xD;
more ready to torment than to admire her.&#xD;
- Thus two months passed away and things were growing worse.&#xD;
Violet alternated between fits of jealous coldness and pooxysms&#xD;
of passionate devotion, both equally distasteful to me, when I re-&#xD;
ceived a letter from a fellow-student in Germany, telling me of his&#xD;
mother's ill health. This mother was a widow: her husband had&#xD;
tilled an honorable post under government, but, occupied with&#xD;
public affairs, he had neglected his own, and dying, left nothing&#xD;
when his debts were paid, for the education of his son Ernest. But&#xD;
Madame Ruckert, full of energy and talent, had, with her pea, se-&#xD;
cured a support for herself and the greatest advantages for her son.&#xD;
And new, when I remem     t-  the pictures which Ernest would&#xD;
draw t( me of his future, hen his mother was to be repaid for all&#xD;
the sacrifices she had mae for him. and contrasted them with this&#xD;
sad letter. where he said he had not the means to try for her the&#xD;
only hope the physician suggested. a year's residence in the south&#xD;
of Italv. my heart swelled at the inequality of our lots, - I with&#xD;
money to waste. and my friend with none to save a mother' life.&#xD;
-- it last a plan occurred to me which I thought Madame Ruckert&#xD;
might agree to, -a plan to benefit my friend and educate my wife&#xD;
at the same time. I wrote to Ernest. telling him my whole story,&#xD;
and proposing that his mother'should come and live in a quiet country&#xD;
house near Naples, for a year, with Violet, undertaking her educa-&#xD;
tion3, and receiving a handsome salary in return. My proposal was&#xD;
jeyfullly accepted. and Madame Rackert set out at OneCO to jo minus.&#xD;
Violetwas vehement in her opposition. when she found I was to&#xD;
leave' her and return to my studies in Germany. But the beauty&#xD;
and comfort 4f her new home, and the dresses and ornaments which&#xD;
I provided feor her, soon reconciled her to a year's separation from&#xD;
Me, while her ambition wa- .Uused to fit herself to appear in society&#xD;
as my wife.&#xD;
1 i returned to Heidelberg and entered with zest into my old life&#xD;
there. Madtine Ruckert's letters were all I had to remind me of&#xD;
the past, and she wrote most charmingly of Violet, de'seribing her&#xD;
dilig.rence in her studies. her softened manners, and her great musi-&#xD;
cal talents, which enabled her to overcome the difficulties of the&#xD;
science with wonderful rapidity.&#xD;
" The last month of my college course had begun, when a break&#xD;
occurred in my regular correspondence with Mladame fRuckert. I&#xD;
wrote to inquire the cause and received no answer. A rumor&#xD;
reached me that the cholera was prevailing terribly in Naples and&#xD;
the surrounding country. Leaving Ernest to settle up all my affairs,&#xD;
I travelled, day and night, until I reached Naples. Then. with fresh&#xD;
horses. without waiting to eat or sleep. I hurried on to \ ol.'t. Ab-&#xD;
sence had dulled my remembrance of all that jarred upon my taste&#xD;
in our wedded life; :sbe'was again the Violet of my first lo ve. And,&#xD;

ETWAnUI TTALBOT sat before the table in his little study. He had been&#xD;
writing '-ince breakfast, but ntow he pushed away his papers, as if his&#xD;
sermon were finished. and bowed his heal upOn his hands, while a&#xD;
feelin- ofdelspondenev crept over him, such as all feel, at times. whose&#xD;
aims ani aspirations are bevonl the power of' accomplishment upon&#xD;

seemed: still erring, still struggling, far from the perfection for&#xD;
which he longed. And his work, too, though to those who remem-&#xD;

&#xD;
the disregard of law, open vice and secret crime, it seemed almost&#xD;
miraculous that one man should have accomplished so much ; he&#xD;
could now only see what he had left undone. His heart yearned&#xD;
towards those who haA strayed from his flock, and the awful thought&#xD;
oppressed him, "God gave them to my charge; Christ redeemed&#xD;
them with his blood, and I have left them to wander and be lost."'&#xD;
We can all of us preach, pour out dull moralities, and point out&#xD;
the faults of our neighbors, that our own virtues may shine the&#xD;
brighter by the contrast.  This style of preaching, professional or&#xD;
domestic, in the curtain lecture or the pulpit, has its uses; at least,&#xD;
it teaches patience. But this is something very different from the&#xD;
gift of the great preacher. Very varied have been the characters.&#xD;
and temperaments of the great preachers of the world, but in this&#xD;
they have been alike. Wholly devoted to their great calling. reason,&#xD;
heart, soul, imagination, ali joined to give the kindling lire. or the&#xD;
melting tenderness to their oratory. Through the darkness f false-&#xD;
hood, and the mist of materialism, one ray from that soin whose&#xD;
light is truth and whose warmth is love. the sun of the heavenly&#xD;
land has reached them. and in its fire the pretensions, conventional-&#xD;
isms, and deceits of life, have shrivelled like a scroll.&#xD;
Inferior as Edward was in tent to these men, he had this same&#xD;
earnestness and truth, and this was the- 'f.cret of his intiuenco. It had&#xD;
cost him a severe struggle to break the ties of affection arwl friend-&#xD;
ship that bound him to his home. to leave behind the admiration and&#xD;
stimulus of intellectual society, and enter upon luis self-apro 'nted task,&#xD;
to build up a church in the -heart of Minnesota. But, having doiae&#xD;
this, with the resoution of the general who burns his ships that retreat&#xD;
may be impossible, he fought the battle of life.&#xD;
A knock was heard at the door, and Mr. Talbot hastily raised his&#xD;
head, and forced a smile. as Minnie Campbell entered with an armful&#xD;
of books. But she was not dlecoivil by the smile. Without a word&#xD;
she untied her hat, and seating herself by him, said in htr sweet, low&#xD;
voice --0&#xD;
" I know why you are sail: yei work so hard to make us good,&#xD;
and we do so little ourselves -&#xD;
'Ie tries ech art, rproven each dull delar.&#xD;
Allures tu brighter wrhi,, and leads the' way.'&#xD;
"But he doens not get discouragrd ,: that would never do iin poetry,&#xD;
and it will not do in real life."&#xD;
Here Minnie looked at her fri. d. with a saucy smile, wlif was&#xD;
now answered b:y one quite as bright on Mr. Talbot's face.&#xD;
"Right. Minnie : it will not di: von seea little sympathy. flat-&#xD;
tery. and repro~of. make the pill I needed)'&#xD;
"And a great deal of affection 'v~u leave out the important part&#xD;
of my dose. without which the rest would have failed."&#xD;
"Right again. voung philosopher' It&#xD;
selfish, that makes your sympathy  latteris  dr love, tr, an  un-&#xD;

Virgil was opened. It was evidenrt Minnie's teacher had a nice&#xD;
&#xD;
ear for quantities, and was hard to satisfy in the choice of language,&#xD;
but she did credit to his careful training. When Mr. Talbot began&#xD;
to read her French composition, he said at once -&#xD;
1 You have been helped here: this is better French than you ever&#xD;
wrote before. Your cousin must be a capital scholar; you had better&#xD;
take lessons of her" -&#xD;
- Oh. may I, Mr. Talbot ?" 'interrupted Minnie, "I wanted so&#xD;
much to ask -&#xD;
She stopped, alarmed at the frown on his face. It disappeared at&#xD;
once. however. as he said, sadly&#xD;
I spoke in jest, Minnie ; but your eager tone shows you really&#xD;
want to change your teacher, and why should I blame you for a&#xD;
child's love of novelty ? Take lessons of cousin Ella, and while the&#xD;
charm lasts, the new teacher will be better than the old."&#xD;
- OhI what have I said. Mr. Talbot : I knew it would hurt myself,&#xD;
Iut I did not think it would hurt you too. I thought it was right, or&#xD;
I should not have tried to say it&#xD;
Her sobs choked her voice.&#xD;
" Minnie, I have been unjust. I see it all now: it is no desire for&#xD;
novelty, kut some little self-sarificing plan you have, that you think&#xD;
will be good for both of us."&#xD;
No, not for both : I did not think it would be a sacrifice for you.&#xD;
But it seemed to me that if I gave up my French lessons, and you&#xD;
would give that time to Ernest, to teach him Latin. it would open&#xD;
his mother's heart, and you might do them both so much good."&#xD;
Yes," said Mr. Talbot. sighing. '*that 's true: I might, and I will.&#xD;
But let us comfdrt ourselves with the thought that it is an equal&#xD;
sacritie for both.  And now, my child, I cannot stop to talk any&#xD;
longer : a poor fellow has sent for me, who has been imprisoned on&#xD;
some false accusation. his brother says, and he depends upon me to&#xD;
have his innocence proved. I must go to St. Paul's and inquire into&#xD;
the matter..'&#xD;
Then oPu will be too tired  -&#xD;
" Not t'oo tired to do my duty, or you a service, Minnie:,indeed,&#xD;
they are gtrierally the same thing. Speak out, - what is it?"&#xD;
"Why. Jessie 'May. Poor little thing. she has been suffering more&#xD;
than usual for the lastfew days. She cries and frets to be taken up&#xD;
and allowed to run about again, and her mother, when I left her yes-&#xD;
terday. begged me to ask you to come and see her.  'One ofhour&#xD;
minister's visits.' she said, makes her patient as a lamb; he 'a&#xD;
doctor ftor soul and body both.' "&#xD;
As Minnie was speaking, the door, which stood ajar, had been.&#xD;
opened. and a sharp voice answered -&#xD;
- It 's a shame. Minnie Campbell: thee dost not know what thee&#xD;
says, chill. Is n't Mr. Talbot likely enough to wear himself out&#xD;
without thy tempting him.Oh my    the work he does. and the&#xD;
little he eats and sleeps; " and the thin, angular figure shook her&#xD;
head from side to side, rolled her eyes up to the ceing, and strik-&#xD;
ing her hand upon her withered breast repeated, " oh my ! oh my!.&#xD;
oh my.'&#xD;
Minnie looked frightened, and well she might : stouter nerves than&#xD;
hers had trembled before the sharpness of Aunt Peggy's tongue. If&#xD;
report spoke truly, her violent temper, so different from the usual&#xD;

Mr. Talbot came to Minnesota just after this event, and succeeded&#xD;
in changing her wrath against her boy. into remorse at having made&#xD;
his home so uncomfortable tto him.  To give Aunt Peggy some&#xD;
object in life, and complete the softening influence he had begun.&#xD;
Mr. Talbot took rooms in her h   ouse. *n condition that she should&#xD;

handfuls of strawberry flowers and buttercups, which he tossed over&#xD;

questions. -Where 's the prairie, Cousin Minnie?  What does a&#xD;
prairie look like?"&#xD;
"YTou will soon see."&#xD;
"No but, Minnie, I shan't know it when I see it, unless you tell&#xD;

two kind living arms, and a voice of heavenly sweetnt ss said,&#xD;
Suffer little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of&#xD;
such is the kingdom of heaven." Pressed lovingly in those arms,&#xD;
so)othed by that voice, all sorrow left them, for they rested on a heart&#xD;
that knew and sympathized with every throb of theirs."&#xD;
Jessie's voice was now gentle and low, and her eyes moist with&#xD;
tears. -Yes, but Mr. Talbot, what became of the little children,&#xD;
when they left his arms?"&#xD;
"Some of them never left his arms."&#xD;
"Did he hold them always?"&#xD;
"Always. Jessie. Sometimes they would do wrong, and then it&#xD;
seemed to them that those arms were withdrawn from them. But&#xD;
when they became sorry, and tried to do right, there were the tender&#xD;
arms still encircling them, there was the tender heart still ready to&#xD;
mourn for their sin and rejoice in their repentance."&#xD;
" And did they never leave his arms, when they were men and&#xD;
women.&#xD;
"No, Jessie. They never were men and women, if you mean by&#xD;
this. able to walk alone: they became more and more dependent,&#xD;
until they were angels in heaven."&#xD;
- And are his arms round me too, and does he love me so much as&#xD;
to want me to stay with him ?"&#xD;
'' Yes, he wants to keep you with him until you, too, become ab&#xD;
angel in heaven."&#xD;
There was a deep silence, for several minutes: then Minnie went&#xD;
softly to the door of the inner room. and Ella and Ernest followed&#xD;
her. It was evident that loving hands had sought to make this&#xD;
little chamber as cheerful as possible. Gay chintz curtains shaded&#xD;
the windows: a table stood between them, ctevered with books and&#xD;
knick-inac'k!: the most precious. two Bohemian glass vases, a gift&#xD;
from Mr. Talbot. which were never allowed to be empty. In&#xD;
summer. the children of the neighborhood picked the sweetest wild&#xD;
owners to ilI them, and in winter. many a brght geranium and fr-&#xD;
grant rose were brought to Jessie. to mix with the ferns and grasses&#xD;
she pressed.&#xD;
Mr. Talbot had seated himself on Jessie'a couch and was holding&#xD;
her in his arms. Poor little Jessie. once full4 of life and activity,&#xD;
darting like a humming-bird from object to object, so that tangled&#xD;

66  ST~rDIH.                                                 rAnDa-                    6&#xD;
&#xD;
eurls, blooming cheeks, and roguish smiles, all mingled in rainbow-&#xD;
like beauty. So it was on that sad Sunday morning, when she&#xD;
danced about, all dressed for church. A robin flew out from one of&#xD;
the upper branches of the old apple-tree : had he a nest there?&#xD;
Jessie thought there would be time to see before her mother would&#xD;
take her to church; there was, indeed, time for much, before Jessie&#xD;
would again go to church. Haste, the consciousness that her&#xD;
mother would scold, should she see her climbing a tree on Sunday,&#xD;
and in her best dress, too, made the agile foot slip, just as it reached&#xD;
the bough from which the bird caine.- She was picked up senseless&#xD;
from the ground; her spine had received an incurable injury, and&#xD;
thenceforth she was chained to her couch.&#xD;
It was a touching sight: the weak. suffering child in the arms of&#xD;
the strong man, -a sight to make us weep. and yet feel pritut of&#xD;
our humanity, fallen though it be. What could he whose life con-&#xD;
sisted in the fullest exercise of body, intellect, and heart. know of(;&#xD;
the weary tossings of the child. condemned to lie still while she&#xD;
was longing to work for her mother. and picturing to herself all&#xD;
those wild scenes through which she once roved at will. Yet this&#xD;
and all other forms of suffering seemedI to have had their symbols,&#xD;
at least, in Mr. Talbot's experience.  Held within , the narrow&#xD;
bounds of his parish, by his sense of duty, at times he had longeI&#xD;
to take part in the great contests of life, where man strugg'les with&#xD;
man, and he had been tempted. by the memory of past success, to&#xD;
wish for further triumphs. Bravely he had struggled ag ainst these&#xD;
desires. and. by his own self-conquest, he had earned the power to&#xD;
help others. For now, in the full rigor of manly strength, holding&#xD;
that feeble form with a woman's tenderness, he sought with fervent&#xD;
supplication for her the peace he himself had found. Mysterious&#xD;
power of sympathy ! From a human heart a throb had risen. and&#xD;
thrilling through the mighty heart of God, back it came, the divi&#xD;
mingling with the human, bringing rest to the weary soul. Jess'&#xD;
lay trustfully upon his breast. her eyes closed. their black&#xD;
lashes still beaded with tears, but her lips were parted with a smile&#xD;
of holy joy.&#xD;
Theo greetings over, Mr. Talbot laid Jessie carefully upon her&#xD;
couch, and calling Minnie to the window, said, "What do you think&#xD;
ofit ? I"&#xD;
" Of what?"&#xD;
" You know very well."&#xD;
"But I don't though. I know what you mean, but not what it is."&#xD;
"Did you not look?"&#xD;
"Into the wagon, but not under the paper: you did not say I&#xD;
mht. ,"        14&#xD;
Ern  t," said Mr. Talbot, "Come ere: what do you see?"&#xD;
"A very pretty cousin," Ernest replied, with a bow.&#xD;
"Much more than that. - a woman who has more honor than cu-&#xD;
riosity. And now, Ernest. not to test this prodigy too severely,&#xD;
-suppose you tak"' the covered object you will see in my wagon&#xD;
very carefully out with both hands. and bring it gently here."'&#xD;
" Yes, Mr. Talbot: I will be very careful, and you know you&#xD;
es trust in" not to peep, because I am a man."&#xD;
An amused smile was Mr. Talbot's answer to this assumption of&#xD;
&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
manly dignity, and Ernest quickly disappeared,  d as   M&#xD;
returned, bringing the mysterious article which Mr. Talbo  ed&#xD;
upon the side of Jessie's couch, saying, "Here is a plaything I&#xD;
brought you from St. Paul's; see if it wili not amuse you whm you&#xD;
ae weary and sufring."&#xD;
Eagerly Jessie took off the paper, and then such a Good of delight&#xD;
broke over her that she was for a moment the Jessie of old, with&#xD;
sparkling eyes, glowing cheeks, and dimpled smiles.&#xD;
" It's a bird!I" she exclaiimed,"A live bird; and for me, to be&#xD;
my pet!"   And you will sing to me, and you will love me, won't&#xD;
you birdie, dear little birdie?"&#xD;
Before any one could speak, a sudden change came over the seo-&#xD;
itive child: stretching out her hand to Mr. Talbot, she said, "I&#xD;
-ill be so good and patient now, and when you see I do not fret&#xD;
nv more. vou will know I am thanking you all the time for my&#xD;
I "d, won't you? " and she looked up beseechingly in his face.&#xD;
All were touched by her gratitude, and the fine instinct she&#xD;
showed in choosing that form of thanks which would best please&#xD;
her friend: and Mr. Talbot felt himself repaid for many a self-eacri-&#xD;
fice, as he pressed his lips upon Jessie's forehead.&#xD;
"But you do not know your pet's accomplishments yet." he said,&#xD;
"Get me a lump of sugar, Minnie." He held the sugar inside of&#xD;
the cage. and the bird immediately made a perch of his finger and&#xD;
nibbled it. He then gently drew out his finger with the bird upon&#xD;
it, who flew to his shoulder and sat there fearlessly. "Now,&#xD;
Jessie. hold the sugar, and see if he will go to you."&#xD;
Jessie took the lump. and the trusting little creature nestled on&#xD;
her arm, and pecked it.&#xD;
"fHow wonderful," exclaimed Minnie. "I have seen mocking-&#xD;
~ Ms very tame. but this bird, - you must have bewitched him."&#xD;
Not I: witchcraft, please remember, is the prerogative of your&#xD;
set.' Listen!"&#xD;
He whistled "Home. Sweet Home."    The bird turned his head&#xD;
from side to side for a few moments. with an attentive air, and then&#xD;
joined in whistling the tune. Mr. Talbot then tried "Yankee Doodle,"&#xD;
and the bird bore his part patriotically.&#xD;
"These are all the tunes I know, but his former mistress said he&#xD;
would imitate everything, from a band of music to a creaking wheeL&#xD;
The bird's historvis this. I drove to St. Paul's, determined to find&#xD;
some pet for Jessie. but not knowing what it would be. At the&#xD;
Jail. I heard of the death of a stone mason, a worthy man, whom I&#xD;
knew very well, and I went to see his family. His wife said she&#xD;
wanted to return with her children to New Hampshire, where her&#xD;
father had a farm, and would give them all a comfortable home, but&#xD;
now that she had paid off the debts- occasioned by her husband's&#xD;
illness, she had not money enough for the journey. I noticed this&#xD;
mockinc-bird flying about the room, from one child's had to&#xD;
another's shoulder, and. upon inquiring about it, foseMd that it had&#xD;
been driven to Mary, the youngest, before it was fully fledged, and&#xD;
that she had nursedi it in fher bosom, and fed it from her plate, ealy&#xD;
putting it in a cage for safety at night. I drew the children tome&#xD;
and told them of a little girl, once playful and active as they, who&#xD;
was now obliged to lie all day long on'her bed. They asked if sh&#xD;

had no bird to talk to. I said, no; she passes long hours alone,&#xD;
when her head aches so that she cannot read or sew, and she feels&#xD;
very tired, and wants something to amuse her.&#xD;
"Let's give her our bird," said George, a boy of twelve, "Ma&#xD;
says we can't take it with us, and its a jolly thing to have a bird like&#xD;
that to teach tunes to."&#xD;
-Yes," answered Susan, "if Mary's willing, I am; its more&#xD;
Mary's than ours."&#xD;
Mary was appealed to, and answered without hesitation, that if&#xD;
she could not take her pet to New Hampshire. she wanted the sick&#xD;
little girl to have it. So it was settled. I gave the widow the&#xD;
means to return comfortably to her old home, and her children sent&#xD;
'Bob' to Jessie. And now,~Minnie. if your cousin will trust to Roland's&#xD;

Mr. Talbot spent the evening at Lakewood. and so well did be&#xD;
succeed in winning Ella's confidence, that she gratefully accepted&#xD;
his proposal to change pupils for a part of the morning, he giving&#xD;
Ernest a lesson in Latin, while she taught Minnie music and French.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ma. TALBOT was in no danger of forgetting his promise, on Satur-&#xD;
day, to Mr. Upperman, nor did he object, when he could spare the&#xD;
time. to a tilting-match with Miss Rosalie, who, not trusting to&#xD;
Cupid's old-fashioned archery. armed herself cap-a-pie with a whole&#xD;
arsenal of weapons. offensive and defensive.&#xD;
But, of course, the whole afternoon coul'l not be devoted to thi-a&#xD;
visit; when his hours f study were over, there were always dutie-&#xD;
to be performed among his poorer parishioners. Were two families&#xD;
at variance, they applied to him. aid his practical good sense and&#xD;
perfect knowledge of the characters with which he dealt, enabled&#xD;
him to settle many a dispute. Was a son unruly: he was sent t"o&#xD;
the Rector. - to be talked to."  The yolung man defiant, determined&#xD;
to resist all authority, was first subdued by Edward's sympathy, to&#xD;
unbosom all his grievances as to a friend. and gradually was made&#xD;
to feel that though there was some justice' in his complaints, toendure&#xD;
was often more manly than tee rebel: while his parents were admon-&#xD;
ished, that, if they would preserve their son's respect, they must&#xD;
show less seltishness, and mere consideration for his opinions and&#xD;
wishes.&#xD;
Mr. Talbot was returning from on. of these parish visits, which&#xD;
had taken him about a mile from home, when, cutting across a&#xD;
meadow, he entered a lane which led to the neatly paved yard at the&#xD;
back of Mr. Upperman's house. Here he met Mike, the Irish boy,&#xD;
who had brought Miss Rosalie-"s notte to him.&#xD;
"Is Miss Rosalie at home, Mike !*"&#xD;
"Yes, sir -not exactly. yer honor."&#xD;
"Not exactly at home; where is she, then!"&#xD;
&#xD;
4 She 's not exactly at home now, yer honor, but she will be&#xD;
p.-a-sently, an' she intinded to have walked home with yer honor,&#xD;
I'm thinkin' afther a time, but you got the start on her."&#xD;
From the kok of utter vacancy that took the place of shrewdness&#xD;
on Mike's face, Mr. Talbot knew that Miss Rosalie was preparing&#xD;
her nets, and that he, or some higher game, was to be ensnared in&#xD;
them.&#xD;
" Where shall I find Miss Rosalie ?" he asked, unwilling to dia&#xD;
point the lady, if he were the destined victim.&#xD;
- She's down by the beech-tree, in the front road, a-waitin' for me&#xD;
to bring her this basket, and she told me to be spry, so I ax yer&#xD;
honor's pardon, an' I must be gone. or I '11 get into throuble."&#xD;
" I am going to her, Mike. and I will carry the basket for you."&#xD;
Mike scratched his head, and rubbed down his freckled face, until&#xD;
he had smoothed it into absolute blankness. and then demurely&#xD;
replied -&#xD;
- No offince, yer honor, but I was not to give it to her if you was&#xD;
in sight: and divil a bit will she like the sight of yer givin' it to her."&#xD;
And Mike. swinging round the basket. so as to display its contents,&#xD;
two turnlledl napkins, took to his heels. Edward followed a side&#xD;
path. which led into the front Avenue. below the old Beech. de-&#xD;
termined t4o make his appearance, in the direction from which he was&#xD;
expected.&#xD;
As he apprfoached the-tree. he was rewarded by a very pretty&#xD;
piture'. Upon the bench beneath its shade. Miss Rosalie had thrown&#xD;
herself, while our old friend. the basket. stood on the ground by her&#xD;
side. Her garden hat lay in her lap, and she rested her head against&#xD;
the-roucgh old trunk, the peach-like bloom of her cheek made more&#xD;
soft and delicious by the contrast.&#xD;
With one little foot she was writing mystic letters on the gravel&#xD;
walk, and so absorbed was she in her occupation. that Mr. Talbot&#xD;
stood by her side before she appearedi to perceive him. She then&#xD;
started. dropped her hat, blushed. smiled, and drawing out a very&#xD;
white hand from its kid gauntlet, Li i it in his. He seated himself&#xD;
on the girounl at her feet.&#xD;
May I study out cour hieroglyphics, Miss Ralie ?"&#xD;
Studv them in welcome: but y u n     sed not hcop to read them.&#xD;

"Everything."&#xD;
"What have you been doing to-day ?"&#xD;
Nursing Uncle, reading, practising, sewing, walking."&#xD;
"Where have you been walking '"&#xD;

Miss Rosalie blushed, looked down at the basket, and came to a&#xD;
full Stop.&#xD;
Well, to take this empty basket where ?"&#xD;
"To John Fairbanks: but I do not say it was always empty."&#xD;
"Not always, perhaps, but it has only had these two napkins in it&#xD;

What a strange man you are? What would be the use in my&#xD;
taking an empty basket to the Fairbanks ''"&#xD;

"But, Mr. Talbot, I have, and was resting. half dead with fatigrue&#xD;

"Much more easily." said Mr. Talbot, in a stern tone,-" Your&#xD;

CHAPTER XVII.&#xD;
&#xD;
Taz exchange of teacher; was at first as great a trial to Ernest&#xD;
as to Minnie, and by ioi means borne with the same sweetross.&#xD;
"It 's real hard to) give up lessons with my pretty mamma an'i&#xD;
study with that grave gentleman," thought Ernest; and harder stiil&#xD;
was the Latin Grammar which the grave gentleman gave him to) learn.&#xD;
But Ernest's nature was a very affectionate one, and Mr. Talbot had&#xD;
&#xD;
srAmaI&amp;amp;.&#xD;
&#xD;
71&#xD;
&#xD;
the power of winning the hearts of all who came in contact with&#xD;
him. Before many weeks had passed, the recitation hour was ado&#xD;
to consist of more than sixty minutes, and plans were often formed&#xD;
between teacher and pupil to pass the afternoon together. The two&#xD;
were to be seen setting out, hand in hand, to visit some of the neigh-&#xD;
boring poor, Ernest listening while Mr. Talbot turned over the&#xD;
pages of that wonderful book, the Book of Creation.&#xD;
iEdward had studied each science so as to possess himself of its&#xD;
principles, and stored his memory with facts to guide him in his ob-&#xD;
servati orns of nature. But it was because this natural world was to&#xD;
him the living garment of the spiritual, that he loved to watch its&#xD;
devel parent, and note the laws of its growth. God, a living God,&#xD;
made known to us in our Blessed Lord. was the central truth about&#xD;
which all others ranged themselves, in his mind, and gave life to all&#xD;
Lis descriptions.&#xD;

Ernest, with each exclamation making a higher bound into the air&#xD;
Are you not glad, Mr. Talbot, I brought you here?"&#xD;
Yes, Mr. Ernest, I am much obliged to you for bringing me&#xD;
here," said Edward, with a bow    of acknowledgment.   Ernest&#xD;
lughed g  turedly.&#xD;
Now,     . Talbot, it's too bad to take a fellow off so; I did not&#xD;
mean anything so absurd as that, though I do take very manly airs&#xD;
sometimes. But you would not have come this way, except to show&#xD;
me this lovely lake, and so I brought you. and you are so kind to&#xD;
everybody that I want you to get the good of it sometimes:  and&#xD;
Esty ended his defence by clasping his arms tightly round his&#xD;
friend's neck, and, happy at the warm embrace he received. he ran&#xD;
away to gather flowers, while Edward stretched himself out on the&#xD;
ground to enjoy the beauty of the scene. Erne-t "ame running&#xD;

his friend, who, not coming under the head of the " young animal,"&#xD;
(ride Professor of the Breakfast-table,) was obliged to refuse, and the&#xD;
boy bounded off, holding a bun in each hand, and taking a mouthful&#xD;
alternately. until he disappeared in the wood that bordered one side&#xD;
of the lake. Hardly had ten minutes passed, when he returned with&#xD;
eyes dilated with wonder and fear.&#xD;
"Oh, Mr. Talbot, there is a wild man living in the woods. He is&#xD;
so hungry he snatched away both my buns. and eat them down in a&#xD;
twinkling, and told me to bring him more, or he'd eat me too. But&#xD;
I ran away. and when I looked back he had hidden in his hut. Do&#xD;
you think he really eats boys and girls that are lost in the woods ?"&#xD;
-Come." said *Mr. Talbot, smiting, "We will go and siee what&#xD;
food he prefers.''&#xD;
Ernest clung to his friend, and tried to hold him.&#xD;
Pray d1o n' t - go into - his hut : he may eat us t' 'o."&#xD;
"You need not go in with me: you can stay outside : and if jou&#xD;
hear the ocgre craunching my bones, run away. But remember, a&#xD;
cowardly bov will never make a brave man."&#xD;
Estv colored, and holding out his hand for the sword Mr. Talbot&#xD;
offere'l him, said. "I have got over my fears. -they were very&#xD;
ftAish. -and I will go with you. Its only bad Islanders, Cani-&#xD;
Cani-something, and shipwrecked sailors, that eat boys. and those&#xD;
boys have ntb swords."&#xD;

a swori like yours. except Wamba, the son of Witless. whose&#xD;
acquaintance v4u will soon make: and. with a stout heart. and ready&#xD;
wit. to back his sword, he saved his master's and his king's life."&#xD;
"How 1d love to save your life with my sword," aid Ernest, as&#xD;
they entered the hut; " but there's no danger here," he added, in a&#xD;
disappointeil whisper.&#xD;
There was inIleed no danger to be apprehended from the poor man,&#xD;
who lay. pah- anl emaciated. on the flor of the hut. He# started up.&#xD;

burly fellow, caught sight of him, he shouted to those behind, "It's&#xD;
the Parson that used to be at Jail, when I was nailed! Curse him,&#xD;
what business has he here !"&#xD;
Dandy Hal, a young man with a well-knit, powerful frame, and a&#xD;
fae that would have been handsome, had it not been for its reckless,&#xD;
dare-devil expression, took upon himself to reply.&#xD;
" Hush, Joe; we bear no grudge ag'in' the Parson, he's allers been&#xD;
good to us."&#xD;
" Well," answered Joe. "I aint the man to gainay Jim Howe's&#xD;
prayers, and all that kinder thing, if 't don't take too long."  To&#xD;
Mr. Talbot -" Hand Jim Howe over to us, sir, and we wvn't hurt&#xD;
you, nor meddle with your trade."&#xD;
"I am sure you would not do me any harm, for you know I am&#xD;
your friend, but I am not so sur of your intentions towards Jim&#xD;
Howe."&#xD;
"We won't hurt. him neither." answered Dandy Hal. with an oath,&#xD;
"no more than we kin help. We'll be as tender as a mother with a&#xD;
sucking babe. We want to hang him. that's all."&#xD;
A horrible laugh at this -troke of wit burst from the crowd.&#xD;
"Why should you want to hang him ?" asked Mr. Talbut.&#xD;
"Curse him !" cried Joe. -- Didn't he kill Big Billy'."&#xD;
Edward now saw what the case was. Big Billy, the leader of the&#xD;
rowdies in St. Paul's, had been mirtallv w 'uned'1 in a s-kirmish&#xD;
which took place at an oyster saloon a few nights beNre. by a man&#xD;
who had made his escape. As sioon as Big Billy died. li. b'riother&#xD;
Joe put himself at the head 4t' these 1 bl'' dhoeunds. whis. having gut&#xD;
upon the tracks of thvir victim. had now hunted him down.&#xD;
Then let him tee punished bv the law," said Mr. Ta.lb t. - I&#xD;

weaker and milder nature#s. whose spirits began to shrink from the&#xD;
bloody work they hail undertakt'n.&#xD;
I pled   io y u most sol-rnaly my w-4rd, that he shall be.1 I ivereI&#xD;
into the hands i4f the auth, riti s to stand his trial for the murder&#xD;
you accuse him of. if yu will quietly disperse, and return tto your&#xD;
homes."&#xD;
Voices from the mob.  -Come. let's do it! The Parson's a kind&#xD;
friend 4ef eun: let's do as he savs '"&#xD;
But Jo-v. in whose heart revemnie had swallowed up all softer feel-&#xD;
ings, again made himself spokesman : he had had many desperate&#xD;
quarrels with his brother whil- livin'Z. but this did not make him&#xD;
desire the less to revenge him when dead.&#xD;
Your law 's tjo slow for us hard-working men : we 're for re-&#xD;
venge without loss o' tim.': them 's our natural rights. and we don't&#xD;
want no law that takes 'em away. Jim IIT'we 's a gone coon.''&#xD;
"Yoeu or I, any one am 'nc us. is liable to be accused of crime :&#xD;
evidence may be strong against us. but is it not a comfort to think&#xD;
that we shall be justly tried by a jury of impartial men, and punished&#xD;
only when our guilt is proved f:"&#xD;
Voices from the crowd.  -Yes!'' " Yes!I" " Them's our rights."'&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
"We 'a a free people, and we 's al innocent, until we we proved&#xD;
guilty !"  "Trial by jury, - that 's our constitution ; the parson&#xD;
says right!"   " A  n  can't gainsay that," cried Dady Hal;&#xD;
"law and justice is something in Amerikay, and by Jimny I we&#xD;
had n't oughter turn agin' our constitution!"&#xD;
Joe felt this patriotism was dangerous ground. Dandy Hal, one&#xD;
of his chief supporters, was about to desert to the side of law and&#xD;
order: matters must be brought to a prompt conclusion.&#xD;
o Very fine, parson; butdamnit, you can't quite cumit overuse&#xD;
You can't argufy us out of our afternoon's sport. Jim Howe kiled&#xD;
my brother Billy, and I'll tighten the rope round his cursed neck&#xD;
before I sleep to night. So stand out of the way, and let 's to our&#xD;
business."&#xD;
"I will not move. I shall defend this helpless man, as I should&#xD;
any one of you who was in his place, with my life."&#xD;
Edward's tone was sad, rather than defiant, but there was such&#xD;
fearlessness in his bearing, that it was evident to the mob, that in his&#xD;
desire to save them from a crime, and to rescue a fellow-creature&#xD;
from a cruel death, his owu safety was disregarded. and that admi-&#xD;
ration which courage always extorts even from the lowest, broke&#xD;
forth in loud cheers. Joe, who now felt he had "a foeman worthy&#xD;
of his steel," shouted -&#xD;
' The Parson 's a regular brick: we 'It have tcr tighten his cravat&#xD;
first : it '1 be two jobs instead of one. but we are up to it!"&#xD;
Loud murmurs of "shame! shame! " arose at these brutal words.&#xD;
Voices from the mob. "6Never hurt the Parson: he cum to see&#xD;
my old woman when she had like to die!"  "He give my little 'uns&#xD;
food and clothes when I was last nailed."&#xD;
a- ee. my friends." said Mr. Talbot, "what an advantage it is to do&#xD;
even trifling acts of kindness to your fellow-men. See how I am re-&#xD;
warded by a gratitude far greater than the services I have rendered&#xD;
you. Then why will you not give to this poor wretch his life ?&#xD;
Think you this will not bring to you a return in proportion to the&#xD;
greatness of the gift! Children of one Father, linked together in a&#xD;
bond of brotherhood, depe'nling upon the same love for your health,&#xD;
strength. and every blessing of your daily life, have you no return to&#xD;
make tor that love which has endured all things, even to a cruel death&#xD;
upon th cross for your sakes, but hatred and revenge ! Forgive, my&#xD;
brothers, I entreat vou. for your blessed Lord's sake, who is even&#xD;
now long'ine' to draw you repentant to his arms, and to press upon your&#xD;
brows the seal of his forgiveness; forgive, that you may be forgiven."&#xD;
Deep silence followed these words. Among that crowd there were&#xD;
boys, who had joined it from curiosity and idleness: youths, who were&#xD;
more mischievous than cruel : and bad men, who loved tumult and ex-&#xD;
citement. and vet were wanting in the diabolical passions that rejoice&#xD;
in human suffering.  All these could not but be moved, by this&#xD;
appeal, coming in tones of tenderness from the lips of a man whose&#xD;
truth and earnestness they had tested, andi never found wanting, in&#xD;
their hour of need. Poor, misguided creatures, they still had human&#xD;
hearts. Joe. and a knot of kindred spirits, the most devilish of the&#xD;
mob, now held a consultation together, the result of which was soon&#xD;
seen. Placing themselves in front of the others, they shouted to-&#xD;
gether -&#xD;
" Down with the Parson ; we 'vs had preaching enough for on.&#xD;

day I Come on, we '1l let no man gam'on us, by the dickens !"and&#xD;
Joe, seizing a stone, aimed it at Mr. Talbot's head, but meeting his&#xD;
eye, the ringleader's arm fell powerless by his side.&#xD;
Backward and forward swayed the crowd, those behind pressing&#xD;
on those before, and those before recoiling before the dauntless glance&#xD;
that was fixed upon them.&#xD;
Mr. Talbot felt the crisis had come, and turning his head. he said&#xD;
to Ernest in French. "Give the poor man more brandy. and get&#xD;
him quietly out of that hole in the back of the hut: he may be&#xD;
able to conceal himself in the woods while the mob surround and&#xD;
seize me.'"&#xD;
The ruffian, released from the spell which Edward's eve had held&#xD;
over him, caught up another stone, and hurled it at his chest.&#xD;
Ernest had seen the motion. and quick as lightning he darted forward,&#xD;
and placed his wooden sword so as to shield his friend. The toy weapon&#xD;
split into fragments. but it broke in some degree the force of' the mis-&#xD;
S    sile, and slightly changed its direction. The boy received the blow&#xD;
upon his own head. and Mr. Talbot turning quickly. was just in time&#xD;
to catch him, as he stag'zered backward. 1Holding Errist"t with one&#xD;
arm, he stretched the other out towards the mob. and exclaimed-&#xD;
"Look here, - see what you have doneO! ne of you threw a&#xD;
stone at rme. an unarmed man. a priest of God, bound by his holv&#xD;
office to do no one an injury. even in self-dqfence.  You all saw the&#xD;
cowardly act, but not one voice was raised to warn, not on. arm was&#xD;
lifted to shield me. when this boy. a more child. who has known me&#xD;
but a few weeks, for whom -I have neither worked nor suffered, as I&#xD;
have for many among you. sprang forward. and with hi,. mimic sword&#xD;
turned on himself the blow with which you would have felled me to&#xD;
the ground. Have you no little sons or brothers to run to meet you&#xD;
on your return home. and must the hands that caress th'e innocent&#xD;
children be thrice dyed in blood. the blood of a noble bo. of a ser-&#xD;

""va .ltW had remaiined Iil'rnt. gazingr upon Ernest. Great was&#xD;

77&#xD;
&#xD;
STANDISH.&#xD;
&#xD;
lie a-listening like anything, until she cum, and when he heard h,&#xD;
he would- clap his little thin hands. You see I worked for Mr.&#xD;
Campbell then, and he took sick of a fever, and the old woman she&#xD;
died afore, so there was only him and me. And Miss Campbell she&#xD;
took my hand and spoke so sweet after Joe died - I never thought&#xD;
I'd pay her this - a-way."&#xD;
"Nor shall you," said Mr. Talbot, laying his hand on Joe's&#xD;
shoulder: "with God's blessing you shall reward Miss Campbell for&#xD;
her goodness. But let us first kneel down and ask our heavenly&#xD;
Father's forgiveness for the past, his guidance for the future."&#xD;
He knelt. still supporting Ernest with one arm, and, as if swayed&#xD;
by one will. that subdued and repentant crowd knelt around him.&#xD;
For that one moment, all past fears, all present anxieties, were lost&#xD;
to Edward in the flood of love and gratitude that swept over his&#xD;
soul, - love for these reckless, misguided children, whom he longed&#xD;
to gather into Christ's fold, and gratitude towards Him who had held&#xD;
back th' murderer's arm, and given the boy strength for his self-&#xD;
sacrine.&#xD;
Forth from his soul this love and gratitude were poured in words&#xD;
of fire: like fire they melted those awestruck and humbled hearts.&#xD;
The words f that prayer - no mortal ips will ever repeat, no&#xD;
mortal pen will ever trace them. but, inscribed by the Recording&#xD;
Angel, they will eternally mark a day of joy in heaven.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XVIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
His prayer finished, the time for action had come, and Mr. Talbot&#xD;
showed the promptness and decision of his character. One mes-&#xD;
senger he dispatchel with a line to the magistrate. desiring him to&#xD;
send a constable with £ warrant to take Jim Howe into custody.&#xD;
He wrote bv another to Dr. Stewart. the best surgeon in t. Paul's,&#xD;
asking him to meet him at Lakewood. To Joe, he gave a note for&#xD;
Miss Campbell. In this note. he did not conceal from her that he&#xD;
felt very anxious about Ernest, though he hoped his fears were&#xD;
groundless, lie begged her to send the carryall to them at once;&#xD;
Joe would show where they were. and he gave poor Minnie the task&#xD;
of preparing her cousin for'Ernest's condition. The rest of the mob,&#xD;
now a quiet 4roup of repentant men. he sent to their homes, by twos&#xD;
and three. with the assurance that he would prevent Jun s escape,&#xD;
while all that had occurred that afternoon should be remembered by&#xD;
him only as establishing a stronger bond of confidence between them.&#xD;
The hour that then passed seemed like a week to Mr. Talbot, as,&#xD;
seated in the hut by Jim Howe's side, holding Ernest in hisL arms,&#xD;
he   mised to the one a fair trial and good counsel, and to the other&#xD;
that he should soon see his mother. The distance to St.,Paul's and&#xD;
Lakewood was about the same: both messengers exerted themselves&#xD;
to the utmost, and nearly a; the same time, the constable in a wagon&#xD;
and the Lakewood carryall arrived.&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC6624-00000041"/>&#xD;
76&#xD;
&#xD;
qAnI.&#xD;
&#xD;
The family stood upon the porch with anxious faces, waiting for&#xD;
their return. Edward took Ernest up stairs and laid him upon his&#xD;
own little bed. Dr. Stewart put a cordial to his lips; he swallowed&#xD;
it, opened his eyes, and stretching out his arms towards his mother,&#xD;
drew her head down upon his pillow, and held it there with all his&#xD;
childish strength.&#xD;
"Mamma, my head swims so, and .it 's all growing dark. I don't&#xD;
like to look at you, you dance so strangely up and down, but it 's&#xD;
nice to feei your cheek against mine. I 've felt dreadfully ever since&#xD;
that blow on my head: I do n't believe I shall ever be well again.&#xD;
I want to see papa. Why didn't we bring papa with us? Ie&#xD;
would have liked to hear about it. Mr. Talbot stood so bravely&#xD;
against them all, and. mamma, I defended him with ny wooden&#xD;
sword: didn't I, Mr. Talbot !'"'&#xD;
"Indeed you did, my boy: this little hand." and Mr. Talbot kissed&#xD;
it reverentially, " has just performed a hero's act. You have saved&#xD;
my life: God grant that it may not have been at too great a sacrifice."&#xD;
For a moment, Estv's pale cheek flushed with pleasure at this&#xD;
praise : the flush faded away, and with it his last thought of earth.&#xD;
An angelic smile spread over his face as he said, faintly, "I can't&#xD;
stay any longer now. It 's warm and bright, and beautiful children&#xD;
are beckoning to me to come and play with them. Bid papa good-&#xD;
by for me. Don 't cry so, Debby dear. You need not mind my&#xD;
going, mamma: I won't stay long."&#xD;
And he was gone. The pale cheek, which still rested atrainst&#xD;
Ella's. had become cold; the little arms that had pressed her neck&#xD;
convulsively dropped their hold. stiff and powerless. Ile was gone.&#xD;
"You need not mind my going, mamma, I won't stay long." How&#xD;
often would that childless mother think of these words. 'luring the~&#xD;
weary days that must pass. before Ohe could again press' her darling&#xD;
to her heart. She might indeed go to him, but he could never return&#xD;
to her.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XIX.&#xD;
&#xD;
ALTHOETGH Mr. Talbot had feared Ernest was seriously injured he&#xD;
was not in the least prepared for his sudden death, and the shock&#xD;
overwhelmed him. A feeling of self-reproach too, mingled with his&#xD;
grief: it seemed to him that he had murdered the boy. lie strove to&#xD;
pray, but his colorless lips could utter no sound: a heavy weight&#xD;
pressed him down to the earth, and prevented his thoughts from&#xD;
rising alm-ve it. He was leaving the house, in utter misery, without&#xD;
speaking to any one, when he felt a little hand slipped into )his, and&#xD;
Minnie gently drew him into the parlor  lie threw himstlIf down&#xD;
upon the sofa, and burying his face in the cushions, groaned aloud.&#xD;
Minnie. whose tact, springing as it did from a combination if sensi-&#xD;
bility and sympathy, never deserted her, left him alone for a few&#xD;
moments, but soon returned, bringing a glass of wine. She bent&#xD;
over him, and said, "Lift up your head. and drink this."  Mechan.&#xD;
icaly he obeyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
79&#xD;
&#xD;
s&#xD;
&#xD;
In that helplessness which        ms,at times the strongst,&#xD;
there is comfort in being directed and taken care of: and so Mr. Talbot&#xD;
found it. When be handed Minnie back the glass, he looked up&#xD;
imploringly into her soft brown eyes, and said, -&#xD;
" I feel like a murderer. How can your cousin forgive me: how&#xD;
can I forgive myself ?  Noble little fellow ! A fresh, innocent life,&#xD;
full of rich promise, sacrificed to save a miserable, sinful, lonely&#xD;
man. It is all dark to me - I cannot understand it:" and again&#xD;
Edward buried his face in the sofa cushion, as if he could not bear&#xD;
the light of day.&#xD;
Minnie remained very still for a moment, and a great tear. rolling&#xD;
down her chetk, fell upon his hand, which she held tightly clasped&#xD;
in hers. Then she said, quietly -&#xD;
-ir. Tilbot. if one of your parishioners had actel as you have&#xD;
done. and were ntw suffering from the result, what would vu say to&#xD;
him  ""&#xD;
Ile raised his head.  "I don't know : what should I .  And as&#xD;
he spoke. his lips half quivered with a smile : there was something&#xD;
piquant in this change of position. Minnie the shepherd. and he the&#xD;
wandering sheep: but the thought quickly passed away, and his&#xD;
burden of grief seemed all the heavier for it.&#xD;
" You would tell him." continued Minnie, "of God's love, in&#xD;
words such as no one else knows how to use. -fervent, tender&#xD;
words, that melt into the heart, and take all* hardness and bitter-&#xD;
ness away. You would show him that this love is always planning,&#xD;
arranging. disposing all the external events of our life, so as to&#xD;
wear and disappoint us with earthly things, and lead us to&#xD;
bosom. We may not always understand this: we are apt to feel&#xD;
that we could have arranged things better for ourselves : but&#xD;
0. Mr. Talbot. why should I say such things to you: you feel it&#xD;
as I do now. something warm. and comforting. shining down upon&#xD;
us and enveloping us in its s-ft folds. It says to my heart,'Peae,&#xD;
be still.' and it takes the sting from my grief.  Do you not feel&#xD;
it t04  '&#xD;
it tos' my child. I had banished pvself from God's presence;&#xD;
von have brought me back to him. I feel his love and goodness,&#xD;
and can say, 'His will bddone.' Go and minister to others. Minnie;&#xD;
God blesses your effot;" and with a sad, but serene face, Mr.&#xD;
Talbot left the house.&#xD;

ing, as we gaze(that the inanimate body before us could no longer&#xD;
be the abode of one subject to the weaknesses of humanity: every&#xD;
line of age, every mark of care and sin, had disappeared, while&#xD;
the whole form shone with the light of a redeemed spirit, from whom&#xD;
the bonds of earth bad fallen, and whom angels were now preparing&#xD;
for a heavenward flight.&#xD;
We cannot, therefore, wonder that those who bent over little EstT.&#xD;
whose form no trace of time, disease, or sin had sullied. should have&#xD;
found it hard to believe that this was not in truth some little cherub&#xD;
who had ventured far from his heavenly home, and, wear with his&#xD;
journey, had been caught napping hete below. ~i&#xD;
A  beautiful spot in the churchyard was selected fir Ernest's&#xD;
burial-place. The peculiar circumstances attending the b*v's death&#xD;
brought all of Mr. Talbot's parish, and iany pevpie 'of al classes&#xD;
from St. Paul's, to the funeral. Joe. sure of t  result of the ctsr-&#xD;
oners s.inuest, and fearing that he should be arrested and tried for&#xD;
Ernest's death, hal tied, but many of the mob were there. Mr.&#xD;
Talbot's voice trembled with emotion. as he read the service for the&#xD;
dead. Tears rolled down the cheeks of old and young, -nhot f'&#xD;
women and children o~nly. but of hardy and stalwart men. Thank-&#xD;
fness that their rector's life had .been saved, admiration for the&#xD;
boy's heroism. pity and sympathy for his bereaved mother. his faith-&#xD;
ful nurse, and sweet Miss Minnie, whom  all loved, -here were&#xD;
chords to touch every heart.&#xD;
.Still Ella had shed no tear. She stood as calm and unmoved as&#xD;
if she were indeed the beautiful marble statue she appeared. But&#xD;
when the first shovelful of earth fell with dull, smothering' sound&#xD;
upon the little coffin, a cry rent the air, -- a shriek so will, that it&#xD;
seemed the death-pang of a heart breaking with anguish. It made&#xD;
the nerves of all who heard it thrill with terror: they felt it would&#xD;
lie in their memory until their dying day. There was a slight&#xD;
movement among the group of nearest relatives, and Mr. Campbell&#xD;
bre his rniece's senseless form from the churchyard. Ella's swoon&#xD;
continued so long that the family thought life "must be extinct, all&#xD;
save poor Debora1. who would inot believe this last objet of hero...&#xD;

CHAPT  ER XXI.-&#xD;
Tax seven months which followed the events related in our last&#xD;
chapter, were months of anxiety and depression to the whole coun-&#xD;
try. After the excitement of the autumnal elections, there followed&#xD;
a period of doubt and uncertainty, in which the energies of the North&#xD;
&#xD;
L&#xD;
&#xD;
STADi3Hs.&#xD;
&#xD;
81&#xD;
&#xD;
seemed paralyzed.   The Southern States, after the election of&#xD;
Abraham Lincoln as President of the United States, had assumed the&#xD;
position of outraged nationalities, and secession became the cry.&#xD;
Still the North looked quietly on, supposing all this was a plan to&#xD;
obtain farther privileges, and concessions. Even when -little South&#xD;
Carolina went out in the cold," she produced only a momentary sen-&#xD;
sation. But several of the Gulf States followed her example. and, on&#xD;
the tw'ntv-tirst of January. their Senators withdrew from the United&#xD;
States , iate. Arsenals. Navy Yards, public property of all kinds,&#xD;
were %eized 1y the Rebels. The gallant Lieutenant Slemmer threw&#xD;
himself into Vort Pickens, and, with a few brave troops, protected it&#xD;
from 4Gtnral Bragg and his Rebel force. Many patriotic men strove&#xD;
to effect a compromise with the southern Leaders. but it soon became&#xD;
eviqlenlt that thov would be satisfied with nothing that the North&#xD;
could in honor vield.&#xD;
The inauizirati.n of Lincoln to)k plae-e )n the fourth of March,&#xD;
under the prt#-tion 4of a guard of s.ldiers.-a new sight to every&#xD;
American. Still. war, civil war. fathers red with the blood of their&#xD;
sons. and br other in deadly strife with br ther, seemed impossible to&#xD;
the casel. industriou'i. peaceable inhabitants of the North, whose&#xD;
hearts were still full of forbearing love for their fiery countrymen, and&#xD;
a hearty desire that they would cease their secession folly and return&#xD;
to all t, ir rights and privileges. This magnanimity, this genero-&#xD;
itv. this -lswiness to anger, were misunderstood by the Southern&#xD;
people :to them it seemed inertness, cowardice, or an absorbing de-&#xD;
votion tto material interests.&#xD;
-uch was the state of things on both sides. when, on the twelfth&#xD;
of A pril. the batteries of Charleston opened upon Fort Sumter, and,&#xD;
after a ra.v' resistance. our noble Anderson and his hernic hand&#xD;
were forced t' surrender. The reverberations of those guns echoed&#xD;
through the wide land: The shot that hit our flagstaff. and lowered&#xD;
a flag which had never yielded to a foreign f'e, could iot die away&#xD;
in silence betfre the walls of Sumter !An outraged people heard&#xD;
it, and with on' consent they sprang tW arms. It reached the wood-&#xD;
man in his di-tant forest. and he threw down his axv': the farmer&#xD;
started at th.' so'unl. and left his furrow unturned : from workshop,&#xD;
from college. from countin-house. from office. they poured out, with&#xD;
beating hearts andl tashing' eves, to offer their strong arms, their en-&#xD;
erzetic will-S. their thinking brains. their well-tilled purses. their lives,&#xD;
and. more periu s till. their children's lives, to their country, in&#xD;
her hour of need. Should their glorious Republie be rent in frag-&#xD;
ments ?  ShloutYI'Iir Constitution be trodelden untder foot ?  Should&#xD;
their laws h disregarled ? No  the world should uee a Gvernment&#xD;
guarded by a despot's armies had not the strength of this. which,&#xD;
rooted in the hearts of a great p oplo. could use t heir arn, their&#xD;
strength. their wealth as its own. Companies were formed in every&#xD;
village. regiments in every city. Side by side. the scholar and the&#xD;
laborer marched, with musket in hand, to the def"nce of the National&#xD;
Capital.&#xD;
No oine felt the shock of Sumter's fall. more than William Camp-&#xD;
bell. To use his own words, "~ It set him right again; now he saw&#xD;
the enemy, and could raise his rifle ahid take aim."&#xD;

But a veil had fallen ups n her bleeding heart : Heaven mercifully&#xD;

ever tetidede an infant with more devotion, than Deborah now showed&#xD;
towards her helpless mistress. She prepared her foo0d and medi-&#xD;
cine with her own hands. folhswed out every suggestion of the&#xD;
physician with the utmost fidelty. ani the re-gularity of clock-work.&#xD;
Nor was she less careful of her darling's beauty. Ella's luxuriant&#xD;
hair was daily combed and plaited. that not a golden thread should&#xD;
be tangled or broken. During the first few hours after her bereave-&#xD;

and enduring, she had written both to Horace and to Anna. telling&#xD;
them of Ernest's death. One dav, early in January, Minnie was&#xD;
seated by Ella's bedside, while Deborah was preparing her some*&#xD;
beef tea. The invalid had been lying verve quietly for several hour&#xD;
in apparent slumber : suddenly she roused herself. Minnie stooped&#xD;
over her and asked if she wanted anything. As their eves met,&#xD;
Minnie saw at a glance that full consciousness had returned to her&#xD;
cousin, and with it all her suffering.&#xD;
" Has Horace? " - she whispered.&#xD;
Minnie answered by going to a drawer, taking out a letter and&#xD;

IT was a bright starlight evening when Edward Talbot turned&#xD;
into the broad shady avenue that led to Alston Manor. His horse&#xD;
was weary, but his impatience would not allow him to rest: he&#xD;
urged him on with whip and spur. A large black dog came out&#xD;
growling to medt him, but he had only to say, "11 ow now. Don:&#xD;
have you forgotten me ?" when the animal's growl was changed into&#xD;
a bark of reognition and joy. His anxieties for the safety of his&#xD;
father anid coluir hal increased. as he approachel th*- e'iil of his&#xD;
journey. He often tho ught over all the incident '(if ll pleasant&#xD;

I have on#' mitre charge to micake against yitu Mr. Talbot, which&#xD;
seems toe uto be a very "rave one. It has been reported to this&#xD;

These last words were spoken ly Virginia Lee. who had been&#xD;
seated partly ctncealLe by her une~'s chair: but wflW, starting up.&#xD;
and glancin.. reundl indignantly upon the assembly, she continued -&#xD;
" Gentlemen, I have tried to listen patiently to your charges, for&#xD;
my uncle's sake : but I can bear it nli loeng-er. Patience ceaes to&#xD;

&#xD;
their mothers, wives, and sisters, as to bring such an accusation as&#xD;
this against the hospitality and charity of Alston manor. Forty,&#xD;
more than fifty times the food needed by my uncle and myself, has&#xD;
been daily cooked here under my superintendence, and distributed&#xD;
to all who asked for it, without rterard to political differences. As&#xD;
long as you confiscate men's property for their opinions, we cannot&#xD;
see them starve, while we have bread enough and to spare. Had&#xD;
you, gentlemen, ride up to the' Man ir ia a different spirit, the&#xD;
best that we have woulol have be'ena piaed btfiore you. Can you&#xD;
have the hearts of men. and yet. at such a time as this, when fami-&#xD;
lies are divided against themilves. and friends rust part to ruet&#xD;
in deadly conflict on the battle-tield, wish to cause unnecessary&#xD;
suffering. by forbidding the comn tioleari's of life to)  -1, ow;a&#xD;

As Virinia enoitoL. hsl throw  nlioi rin rouolni  her u nr'h-': neck anl&#xD;

again to his paper. saild-&#xD;
Mr. Tatlbmot. I hop.' y ,u will pardon o our intru:tion, anl attrib-&#xD;
ute it to our zeal in a cause which is very dear to) us. If Vou will&#xD;
have the kindness to sign a check to our order for a ft'w hundreds,&#xD;
some mere trifle, we will retire at once', andI you shall be allowed&#xD;
to continue, undisturbed, vour usual mode of life."&#xD;
"0Bribe you, sir, to let me live ;as I like&amp;amp;  Never " and the room&#xD;
rang with the wonr.-&#xD;
"4You mistake. my dear sir : it is not a bribe I ask you for, but a&#xD;
simple contribution of "ome iof yur -upertiluous wealth to the defence&#xD;
of yvour native State.''&#xD;
All my wealth is at the service of my native state, to defend&#xD;
her from treahery and tro asorm Iut yaur.- are not the hands to&#xD;
which I would entrust it.  Y our so-calel ordinance of secession&#xD;
was forced through thie 4onventiora on the seventeenth of April by&#xD;
a mob armed with rev olvtor-; and bo wi-knives, against the wishes&#xD;
of the majority of the' people.  But hal it passed by an unintim-&#xD;
idated majority. Virginia woulol still have been, as she is, in the&#xD;
Union."'&#xD;
Confound it, sir. we cannot listen to such talk as this. Will&#xD;
you sign us the check. or not .'&#xD;
I will not.&#xD;
Angry exclamations burst from the party: they retired to the&#xD;
other side of the room and carried eon a discussion, in which opinions&#xD;
seemed to vary as to the b.est means of subduing the obstinate sub&#xD;
ject before them-.&#xD;
All this time, Edward Talboot had remained in the greenhouse, an&#xD;
unseen spectator, watching with intense anxiety the turn affairs were&#xD;
&#xD;
iI;&#xD;
&#xD;
taking. ready to interpose. should  - le - be attempted, but feeling&#xD;
that his presence and the declaration of his Union sentiments, which&#xD;
he must in! honor make, would only increase the danger of his father's&#xD;
situation.&#xD;
Young Mason now advancelI to wardis Virginia and tried to per-&#xD;
saade her to leave the r on.  'he refused, and maintained her&#xD;
place resolutely li her uno'l.e's si1e. her dark eyes flashing defiance&#xD;
upon his enemies, though her e'heoeks and lips became colorless.&#xD;
At this crisis, a horse at full gall op was heard without. and the rav&#xD;
tling 'of arms. a moment nre. the -or was thrown open, and&#xD;
Coonel Talbot entered. His quick -ye tok in the whole scene at a&#xD;

Yankee Doodle and the StarSpangled Banner. At the Pre=&amp;amp;mt&#xD;
Street Station, in Baltimore, horses were attached to the cars, to take&#xD;
them to the Washington Station : but it soon became evident that&#xD;
some hos-tilp demonstration was intended. A crowd began to collect&#xD;
about thi' ears, hooting and yelling frightfully. Orders were imme-&#xD;
diately  ive'n to the troops to remain silent, and return no answer to&#xD;
the thr'at.-' and insults that were heaped upon them. This forbear-&#xD;
ance. however, seemed only to excite the mob; their language&#xD;
becaimo- n-ore insulting, and seizing stores and brickbat- they threw&#xD;
them a: the e4rs, wounding several of the soldiers. The first nine&#xD;
cars. hi w'vo'r. succeeded in reaching the Camden Street 'ntati.'n. and&#xD;
set 4off arcite" for Washington, leaving g about one hunori oe-n, now&#xD;
cut i    on their companions, an-  urr unled by an infuriated mob&#xD;
of m     h  tiIre-Is. Horace was in tho- last car. an i h-'- aw that to&#xD;

who strove to increase the storm  they had raised,-' P own with&#xD;

not a year since. to be the mildest and most, beneficent known in&#xD;
the hit'oryt of the' world: but think how differently the case has&#xD;
been praenrt-I to Iarry.  -ubtle loric has been used to prove to&#xD;
him that Virginia reserved a right to secede: his passions have&#xD;
been excite' I by the speeches of New England fanatics, who fancy&#xD;
they serve' Ge iby slandering their fellow-men. He has bevn told&#xD;
that the (' n!;titution was intended for a band of frienly States.&#xD;
and that the bitter languacre of the North. acting upon- the passions&#xD;
of the Suth. has kinled up a spirit which makes a 1-rg;er union&#xD;
unendurable. And. more than all, to a greeroui heart like Hal's,&#xD;
the South is the. weakes-t side : how irresistible the temptation to&#xD;
throw his swttr1 into th' li btei-!t scale.&#xD;
YOu are inze'ronlisn in'tinn  argrurnmnt;in the defence of a bad&#xD;
cause. :Sh ull v-u ever b-a' the pulpit, y)u may make your fortune&#xD;

"There. Edlwar 1. let us tAk no more about it. You are a noble&#xD;
fellow. I knew you we nld defend your brother. and for that reason&#xD;
I have bec: ile to gir.. xpression to the grief and shame that are&#xD;
eating into  my heart. M Iv yvou never know what it is to be the&#xD;
father cf a traitor! Hlerte comes Virgnia. After breakfast I must&#xD;
see you in the library."&#xD;
The result of Edward's interview with his father was. that he de-&#xD;
termined, on the afternoon of that same day, to set out for Wash-&#xD;
&#xD;
ington. Jim was dispatched again to the Confederate camp, to&#xD;
inform Colonel Talbot of his brother's departure, and the Colonel&#xD;
soon appeared with Jim behind him, riding a handsome black&#xD;
horse.&#xD;
--1:4o YoU are offat once! said Harry.&#xD;
"Yes," replied Edward: and the two brothers walked the piaa&#xD;
in silence. At last Harry spoke.&#xD;
I Elward. the horse Jim rode up from camp is for you. I trained&#xD;
him on purpose. He comes of the stock of old Henry: has great&#xD;
speed andl bottom: can walk nearly six miles an hour. I have&#xD;
name him Shvlock. for he shies at everything at first starting ; but&#xD;
he soonf tinids out if there is business before him, gives up his non-&#xD;
sense. and goes straight at it. le has been at the camp, but never&#xD;
in what vou call the Rebel service. You won't refuse him '" and&#xD;
Harry Ioelkel with sad wistfulzess into his brother's face.&#xD;
- refuse him. Hal ' I shall value him. as yur gift, above all my&#xD;
earthly p         'You must not think these political differences&#xD;
have changed my heart- towards you. Harry. I tried very hard to&#xD;
keep you where I believed it was your duty to remain. But you&#xD;
thought differently. and nwDw we must each work and suffer for the&#xD;
cause we have chosen, but love and trust each other through all; "&#xD;
and, with tone warm embrace the brothers parted. Little did either&#xD;
imagine what their next meeting would be!&#xD;

Wars Edward reached Willarl's. he wrte ait-a note to General Scott,&#xD;
asking a private interview at his earliest c :Ivtiefee. and stating&#xD;
that he haa some important cttuinunicatioens to make to him.  The&#xD;
answer soein came: a few friendly lines from the General-in-chief,&#xD;
and an invitation to dine with him that day. Edward was very cor-&#xD;
dially received by General Scott, who was an old friend of his ath-&#xD;

sion of weariness on the noble oldl man's face. he had the good taste&#xD;
and feeling tee postpone all allusion to painful topics until the Gen-&#xD;
eral had refreshed himself with his dinner.  The cooking and the&#xD;
wine were excellent, and, the.conversation turninz upon the Mexican&#xD;
war, Gereral Scott told some amusing ane4. let  'f his military life&#xD;
and adventures. It seemed to be a great relief to him to de41ngage&#xD;
his thoughts for a time from the heavy responsibilities weighing upon&#xD;
Whe- the servants had withdrawn. Edward laid before the Lieu-&#xD;
tenant-General. his father's conjectures. concerning the plans ef the&#xD;
Rebels. giving. as clearly and as briefly as pos.ile, the information&#xD;
and facts upon which he founded them.  The General listened with&#xD;

Their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Seward,&#xD;

scout whom he had despatcheld to Annapolis with forders f'or Gov-&#xD;
ernor Hicks, to send forwarl the Massachusetts-and NeW York&#xD;
troops by the Annapolis Railr'.ad. had not vet returned. and he feared&#xD;
he had been captured by the Maryland secesionists. who, he un-&#xD;
derstood, were guarding the road.  Something must be done. It&#xD;
was now Tuesday afternoon. and. since Sunday morning at eleven&#xD;
o'clock, no telegraphic message ai bad teen received from the North,&#xD;
-no direct communication hadL been held between the Capital and&#xD;

difficulties, and the prudence which be showed in learning before-&#xD;
Land the ruads they must pass over, and the obstacles they must en-&#xD;
counter.&#xD;
General McClellan learnt through his scouts that the enemy's force,&#xD;
under the command of General Garnett of Virginia, had strongly&#xD;
fortified themselves at two points not far from Beverly. Two roads,&#xD;
one from Buckhannon, and the other from Philippa. unite at Beverly.&#xD;
A mountain ridge crosses these roads, and the Rebels chose both&#xD;
points of intersection for their intrenchments. Colonel Pegram had&#xD;
the comnuid of one, called the Rich Mountain Camp, while General&#xD;
Garuett. with the remainder of his troops, held Laurel Hill Camp.&#xD;
It was determined that our forces should first ruarch on the fortifi-&#xD;
catioon.- of Rich Mountain.&#xD;
The nio)ruing fixed upon for the advance of the army was misty;&#xD;
this mist son turned into rain. and then it poured with all the ti-&#xD;
lenIkice 'ef a summer shower. Horace now had his first experience of&#xD;
an Aiwrican campaign, so different, in many respects. from any-&#xD;
thing tlt an European soldier has to encounter. Their way lay&#xD;
through pathless woods, over rough hills. into valleys rich w ith a&#xD;
tangled mass of vegetation. At every step the mud grew deeper,&#xD;
their progress more difficult. Every noeuntain stream was swollen&#xD;
into a rivulet. and every rivulet *-came a foaming torrent. home&#xD;
slipped down in the mud, some plunged into pools knee deep. some&#xD;
staggerei from fairdfness and exhaustion, but. sustained bey the hope&#xD;
of reaching the enemy, our troops still kept lbravely on. While their&#xD;
young commander, roused from his habitual calmness and reserve,&#xD;
hal eve. ear, encouragement for all. How could soldiers complain,&#xD;
when~ their general good-humoredly dismounted. where the under-&#xD;
brush was  thickest, and led his horse through the tangled bushes,&#xD;
or. giving him into some soldier's charge, stepped back to urge on&#xD;
with cheering words the exhausted, or reprove the straggling r  No&#xD;
act f kindness ever seemed tee be unrieticed by him. The muan that&#xD;
helped his weaker comrade over the stream, was sure to receive&#xD;
a "Thank you, my boy." that went to his heart.&#xD;
As thev approached Rich Meuntain. it was ascertiined that the&#xD;
intrenchnients. one on the teep. and one at the f6ot, of the neountain,&#xD;
wero very strong in position. and could not lt' taken directly. with-,&#xD;
out a great loss of life. It was therefore arranged. that Genal&#xD;
Roecrans should, at davbreak the next morning, take the 8th ad&#xD;
10th Indiana. and the 19th 4Iihio reiments. and. Stealing round th&#xD;
mountain. climb up the vIt.    ile of the intrenehments-. so as to&#xD;
surrunI the enemv. and attack the upper frtificatieon in the rear,&#xD;
while General McClellan. with the rest of the tro ps. hniuld cut a&#xD;
road threeugh the Woo4deb for his carmnnlkn, te a po it which cC nruItanded&#xD;
the liwer intrenchnent.&#xD;
At dawn, Reosecrans moved with his ceomnanl. antd Stanlish was&#xD;
ordered to accompany him. It was very chilly: the woois were&#xD;
thoroughly wet with the rain ef the day bfefre. and a A coll, with&#xD;
but a scanty breakfast, and stiff with yesterday's march, they pushed&#xD;
their way 'through the narrow defiles. scrambled civer recks, or&#xD;
climbed up the bank ,tain streams. receiving from each bush&#xD;
they passed a frest sath most of the party felt dispirited&#xD;
and forlorn enough.&#xD;

But Hlorace's spirits rose in proportion as those of his companions&#xD;
sank. Excited by the picturesque scenery. the difficulties of the&#xD;
way. and the project of a battle. his versatil- character now showed&#xD;
t  h gr-Itest advant age. The first to force his way through the&#xD;
thick u...lurbrush, or to ford a difficult stream, he lingered to assist&#xD;
the weak and the weary. ani then would dart forward and t4ke his&#xD;
old place in the l-adt.&#xD;
It was wonderful how popular his crackers. soaked in bad brand.&#xD;
and his worse j(Oke--s, b-came in the regiment. But there was onedi-&#xD;

of the \inetee-nth was almost his equal in skill. and mo re~ revengeful;&#xD;

the Yankees now? "&#xD;
&#xD;
In the mean time. R.'secrans had placed the Nineteenth Ohio bojs&#xD;
on a high piece of ground, where they could command the position&#xD;
of the enemy. From this height they poured down volley after&#xD;
volle up'n the discumited Rebels,. whom they had drawn from their&#xD;
enrnehments, by falling back and feigning to retreat. At last the&#xD;
moment came for a bayoret charge. and General Rosecrans. pleased&#xD;
with Ilerace's energy and daring. gave him the welcome permission&#xD;
to lead it.&#xD;

spirit, which his mother valued so much. tied. He was taken to the&#xD;
hill above head-quarters, and buried by the Virginian troops. Would&#xD;
it comfort that mother, to read this inzcriptiou on his grave ? "YName&#xD;

fell fighting by his side, while his companions fled."&#xD;
The action was over.   The reserve of the army came up. each&#xD;
regiment was assigned its quarters on the battle-field. The wounded&#xD;
of the Uijioti and the Rebel forces were carried off to hospital qu-&#xD;

were cttllo-cted, and a guard placed over them for the night. As&#xD;

worked away sme tinms. in silence  When the [-ox was tinished,&#xD;
Miss R salie put on her things. and Mr. StrrI. though wishing&#xD;
to linger. felt in duty bound to aIconqpany her. as the suna had al-&#xD;
seady set.   Miss Rosalie talked of the sunet, the war. the&#xD;

were lsewhere, and shte was pnte'ri;: l-v what art she coll make&#xD;
him unveil then. when, wiping his high cheek bnes in that way&#xD;
well known to his parishioners as sure to follow the " D earlv Be-&#xD;
loved," while a kind of mahogany color spread from the roots of&#xD;
his hair to his thin, yellow beard, he began -&#xD;
" Miss Campbell -she defended me - do you think-- that is, can&#xD;
you say - I -iknow so little about women ; my mother died in my&#xD;
childhood : I never had a sister : would it be asking too nch ---&#xD;
that is to say. a liberty, if- Mits Rosalie. be my friend."&#xD;
here th poor voung man plunged his hands into his trousers&#xD;
pockets in a very unclerical style  Miss Rosalie answered (with&#xD;
downcast eye' . Trust me ; open your heart to me : consider me&#xD;
your friend, sister&#xD;
Mr. Stone pre'-e 41 a little ieed hand in his honest, hearty&#xD;
grasp. " Thank votu. von never -ball regret vur kindness. Your&#xD;

Miss Rosrie played with he r wr sunhaili. opened and shut it, as if&#xD;
some inspiration were hidden in the sp-ring, and then turning sud..-&#xD;
denly to Mr. Stone. asked -&#xD;
"HIow long have you known Mr. Talbeot ?"..&#xD;
-" Many years. But do answer my question ; don't talk of Mr.&#xD;
Talbot now."&#xD;
" Have patience. Hie has been a long time ,a friend of yours ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
" An acquaintance, perhaps, rather than a friend. y oa&#xD;
brother Richard, was at Harvard with Talbot; they were friend_,&#xD;
and worthy of each other. Richard studied medicine, and his lif&#xD;
fell a sacrifice to his heroism at Norfolk, when the yellow fryer&#xD;
raged there."&#xD;
" Then," said Rosalie, who had listened impatiently to the&#xD;
family details. " your course is clear. Both Mr. Campbell and&#xD;
Minnie must feel that their acquaintance with vou is very short :but a&#xD;
word frim Mr. Talbot will put it right.  Sit down this evening&#xD;
and write a long letter to him: tell him of your love for Mi&#xD;
Campbell, the sympathy of tastes and pursuits that has constantly&#xD;
increased it, your hope that you are not entirely indifferent to her,&#xD;
and ask him to assist your suit by using his influence with the&#xD;
fair lady, in your favor."&#xD;
Mr. Stone's face brightened as he listened, and when he tok&#xD;
leave of Miss Rosa ie. it was with the feeling that, after all, there is&#xD;
nothing' like a female friend. A woman's suggestion, thought the&#xD;
honest Rector. like the answer to a conundrum, seems very simple&#xD;
when you know it, but a fellow would be a long time finding  t&#xD;
for himself.&#xD;

her. and ran into the house. IIis whole frame shook with great con-&#xD;
vulsionis, which seemed like waves passing over a corpse. his face&#xD;
was s4) pale and still. After a few moments he, too, moved away,&#xD;
and went to the stable to erd.'r his horse,. As he cae back along&#xD;

laced their btranch.'s verh.'ad. and th- grass ever grew freshly under&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
&#xD;
By two o'clock on Sunday morning, the twenty-first of June, all&#xD;
wa   stir and preparation in the Federal army. By hillside and&#xD;
mountain slope, in mistyvalley, and by running stream, miles apart,&#xD;
camp-tires were lighted. About these stirred the cooks of each regi-&#xD;
ment, preparing the early meal. Horses wire rubbed down. fed, and&#xD;
harnessed to the artillery. Army wagons and ambulances were got&#xD;
ready. ani soon, without noise or confusion, every regiment took its&#xD;
place in the line of march.&#xD;
On they passed, with brilliant uniform, embrilered standard, and&#xD;
burnishexd bayonet glistening in the moonliht. volunteersI' m all&#xD;
the Union-loving States, full of enthusiasm. but wanting the dis-&#xD;
ciplined courage of veterans.&#xD;
The enemy's position at Mitchell's Ford, on the road fr 'mu Centre-&#xD;
vile toManassas Junction, having proved qoi Thursdav's recoinois-&#xD;
sace too string to be attacked with prudence. it was debternined&#xD;
by McDowell to take advantage of the Stie Bridge. crl.irng Bull's&#xD;
Ran higher up, to mass his force-s 'n his right wini:, a.I turn the&#xD;
enemy's left flank. The reserve force undf r Colonel Miib-s. fortu-&#xD;
nately containing Blenker's Germans. were left for the protutiton of&#xD;
Centreville, while the rest of the army a ivanct1.&#xD;
The left and centre having the shortest distance to march, were&#xD;
frst in position. The left. under Colonel Richarison, was piisted at&#xD;
the site of Thursday's skirmish, with orders ti make a f int at the&#xD;
moment of the real attack : while Tyler, with the rest of uii isn,&#xD;

sight before, for an attack to be made on SUnday morning, at ix&#xD;
o'clock upon the Federal army at Centrerilie, which was to have&#xD;
been done by an outfiLanking of the left wing of the Union army.&#xD;
He depended upon the Hampton Legion, and 'me troops withdrawn&#xD;
at the last moment from Fredericksburg, to arrive on this end of the&#xD;
feld, and form the reserve of the attacking squadron.&#xD;
General Johnston, the senior general, though he left through&#xD;
courtesy the command to Beauregard, disapproved of this plan, and&#xD;
when ti scouts brought the information to the Rebel headquarters,&#xD;
that the Union army was marching down from its strong position,&#xD;
to assail their superior numbers, he induced Beauregard to give up&#xD;
his plan. and standt on the defensive. But no change was made in&#xD;
the po..ititio of the Confederate army, except to strengtilhen its centre&#xD;
opposite the Ford. on the direct road to Centreville.&#xD;
it was vleven o'cluck before the main attacking force of the Fed-&#xD;
eral army began the battle. The brigades of Tyler's division crossed&#xD;
the bridge and joined in the fight. But Schenek's brigad, most un-&#xD;
accouitallv remained on the east side of the Run. 1eavin1g the left&#xD;
of th centre uncovered. In this place. too, Gteneral Tyler. from&#xD;
want 4f experience. contented hiTiself with silencing, instead of&#xD;
taking a Rech battery. which was left in the rear of the advancing&#xD;
colunin. Later in the day, the S uth Carolinian Gunynrs returned&#xD;
to this I attrv. frum the adjacent thicket whtre they had taken&#xD;
refuge : andl 4r these two blunders. the country paid a heavy pen-&#xD;
altv'.&#xD;
The frtiune of the battle nearly turned upon thle p-ssion of a&#xD;
cluster f f'arm-buildings. ccuipyin. an elevated position upon the&#xD;
line of the advance. Could the Union troops have held these, a&#xD;

"Stonewall !  Stonewall! " shouted Harry Talbot, as he made a&#xD;
furious rush upon the enemy. The men felt their strength renewed,&#xD;

were thrown away, lest they should impede their owners' reckless&#xD;
fight.  Drivers of heavy wagons dashetd down the steep road,&#xD;
regardless of the lives they endangered. The agony of that flight can&#xD;
only be understood by those who unwillingly were borne on in it,&#xD;
brave men, who would have welcomed an enemy's bayonet, as an&#xD;
escape from its disgrace. There was but one thing that saved these&#xD;
from self-destruction, from turning to be trampled to death, with&#xD;
their faces towards the foe, and this was the thought that they were&#xD;
routed by n) foreign enemy : tht- valor and skill that had put their&#xD;
boastful army to  ight, belonged as much to their nation, as this&#xD;
cowardly panic.&#xD;
A mile west of Centreville. stretching across the road, was a firm&#xD;
line of men. who lmoked with woinler en their flying comrades. This&#xD;
was Blenker's regiment.   Steadily they kept their post. giving&#xD;
shelter and protection to the di.*rderedl mnukitue that tied to them,&#xD;
checking a charge from the Rebel cavalry. and thus preventing any&#xD;
further pursuit.&#xD;
In the mo-an time. a far diforent scenic wa- taking place at Sudley&#xD;
Chuitch. By Dr. Magruler's orders. th-S--eats were remeeted. blankets&#xD;
spread upon the floor, the altar tittel up as an operating talle, and&#xD;
soon the little building was tilled to eortliwing. with the wounded&#xD;
soldiers. A carriage-hus, barn, and dwe-llin;. hard by. were used&#xD;
for the sa.tmae purpose. and ithn the:lbullances were unloaded in a&#xD;
shady grieve by the side of the church,&#xD;
Among these woun lel E ward unsied himself. putting water to&#xD;
parched lip , givin;:e erdiak. andandndaging the severed veins and&#xD;
arteries of thoecse whio waited fr the suren'ds aid. But while doing&#xD;
all in hi- power to save life, he did nobt forget that his duties lay&#xD;
chieflv with the dying. His clear voice. mining with piercing&#xD;
shrieks and irroans, could be heardl imploring .;-d's mercy feor some&#xD;
poor fellow who was breathing his last in hi-. arms: aned many a&#xD;
sinner's harl-iess and profanity melt. I away. anti he became humble&#xD;
as a little child. as he listetel to) th se tender. -upplia j tones.&#xD;
An ambulance had just been unloaded near him. when  heard a&#xD;
voice which semed familiar tee his ears call out, - Water, frXGOd's&#xD;
sake, water "   lie filled a c-anteen. and hastened to the wounded&#xD;
man, who emptied it eagerlv. and then looking up in his ace,&#xD;
said -&#xD;

Edward lifted him as gently as possible in his arms. Hal's face&#xD;
showed thce agony this change of position caused, but he stilled his&#xD;
groans with an oath, lest he should grieve his kind friend.&#xD;

"But you will go to him some day, Jim, if you do your duty as&#xD;
&#xD;
your Master Harry did. You know there is the awme kind Father&#xD;
ready to receive you, when your work here is done."&#xD;
Jim's face brightened for a moment, and then clouded over.&#xD;
"Yes, Mass., Jim knowsdat, God bery good ; but de Lord say,&#xD;
'in my Fa'ders house he hab many mansions,' and he'll put&#xD;
Massa Harry in a splendid big house, wid a roof all gilded ober&#xD;
wid de sun of righteousness : but when Jim cum, he'll pint to a little&#xD;
house eber so far off, and say, - Jim, dat's your house,' and dough&#xD;
it ' be a nice place enuff, whar de storm neber blow, and plenty of&#xD;
powers and fruits, it wont be no hebben for Jim widout Mass.&#xD;
Harry."&#xD;
Edward could hardly suppress a smile at Jim's idea of the aristoc-&#xD;
racy of heaven, but he gravely answered -&#xD;
" You will find Master Harry needs and loves you in, another&#xD;
world, just as he did here. and has a place in his mansion that&#xD;
nobody but you could fill, Jim."&#xD;
"Oh, hebben bless you for dem words, Massa Edward: you know&#xD;
jess wat to say, to make de sun shine in' de bery cloudiest wedder."&#xD;
Jim wiped his eyes, and went on with his morning duties of feed-&#xD;
ing and cleaning the horses. Edward passed through a meadow&#xD;
back of the stable into a wooded ravine, through which murmure:i&#xD;
a ittle troutstream. This had been a favorite spot with Harry;&#xD;
here he would lie in wait for hours. under the shadow of the willows,&#xD;
fir a nibble from the timid little fish he found it such sport to catch.&#xD;
But Edward was not thinking of the fish that hid themselves at his&#xD;
approach, not even of Harry ; his little talk with Jim had carried&#xD;
him beyond the grave into that life which death opens to us.&#xD;
What memories of the past life shall we carry into the future? If&#xD;
all were forgotten, our identity would be lost ; if all were remem-&#xD;
bered, we should be too closely bound to earth. There must be two&#xD;
memories, the one belonging to the inner, the other to the outer life.&#xD;
All cares and anxieties connected with our existence here. passing&#xD;
events. thoughts which relate to mere externals, even friendships&#xD;
made by circumstance, having no foundation in real needs and sym-&#xD;
pathies, will vanish in that full awakening, like the visions of a&#xD;
dream. While all that has moulded the intellectual life. or given&#xD;
nourishment to the soul. will remain: true friendship will become&#xD;
more trusting and unselfish. true  ave more pure and ardent, when&#xD;
the bonds of earth are broken. lie tok a note-book from his pocket,&#xD;
and as sentence after sentence rat off the point of his pencil, he was&#xD;
surprised at the clearness of thought, and glow of imagery which&#xD;
enabled him to grasp and illustrate' what at first seemed so far of&#xD;
and vague. A text might have b. .n found, and these sentences&#xD;
expanded into a discourse. which would have made the writer&#xD;
famous, had he not been unfortunately interrupted on the very&#xD;
threshold of his greatness. as many of my readers have been. George&#xD;
came up with a package of letters, which had just been brought by a&#xD;
Confederate soldier. Inclosed was a kind note froa Jackson, saying&#xD;
that these letters had been forwarded from Washington with others&#xD;
by a flag of truce, under the idea that Edward was a prisoner at&#xD;
Richmond, and were now by his orders sent to the Manor.&#xD;
Edward looked over his letters impatiently:- there was none from&#xD;
Minnie, and he wanted to go on wihhis writing. He read hastily&#xD;

STANDISH.&#xD;
&#xD;
through one after another, making notes on the back of each. Thelast&#xD;
was from Mr. Stone, Edward smiled satirically as he read it, and said&#xD;
to himself, fool and coxcomb, how sure he seems to feiel that th&#xD;
young lady will fancy him if he can prove a good character, respect-&#xD;
able connections, and all that sort of thing! Nothing but a flat&#xD;
refusal will cure his absurd vanity, and this Minnie will delay as 1ng&#xD;
as possible. Young and innocent as she is, she will play the cat-and-&#xD;
mouse game with all the skill of an experienced pussy. Poor Stone!&#xD;
there never lived a more unselfish, or purer-minded man, high-princi-&#xD;
pled and earnest too, a little narrow and bigoted. But that's ,v&#xD;
matter: a woman who loved him would find a high pyramid as&#xD;
pleasant to gaze upon as a wid '-spread laundsape. But whi the&#xD;
deuce told him to write to me : he has plenty 4f relatives and friends&#xD;
who know much more about him than I do. It puts mie in a false&#xD;
position: the relation in which I stand to Minnie uake-. it impsile&#xD;
for me to le his confidential friend. Could Minnie''&#xD;
A red flush mounted to his brow. and he started up from the&#xD;
rock upon which he sat. The pain was  -o harp he felt as if somv&#xD;
one had struck him a blow. and involuntarily looked round to see if&#xD;
those drooping willows that shaded the stream concealed an enemy.&#xD;
But closer, much closer than the willow thicket lurked his f WIP&#xD;
cowering in darkness, loving treachery am1 deceit, skilled with th.,&#xD;
dagger and the bowl, ready to pierce the heart or poison the veins.&#xD;
Fiend of Jealousy, once routed. never conquered, you have waitzd&#xD;
until the handsome sunny face he loved so dearly, is frozen in death.&#xD;
and the strong nervous arm that rested so caressingly upon his&#xD;
shoulder is stiff and powerless, to fling your poisoned arrow at the onfe&#xD;
little being whose love his aching heart can rest upon.&#xD;
Edward now felt himself the fool and coxcomh he had just pro-&#xD;
nounced Mr. Stone to be. This appeal to him. A man would have&#xD;
thought of it: it was Minnie's plan of communicating, as delicatelv&#xD;
as possible, her change of feeling. Or perhaps there was no change:&#xD;
her love for him might always have been a kind of hero-worship:&#xD;
girls were prone to this sort Of thing. But no. he could not believe&#xD;
his own thoughts: M  ninnies tender brown eyes reese ace-usingly e-&#xD;
fore him. Yet she might !ove him as a father, an elder brother, the&#xD;
difference in their ages was so great. IIe did not know, he could&#xD;
not tell : all was dark. His glance fell upon his note-book, and he&#xD;
tore eut the pages he had been writing. crushel them in his handi,&#xD;
and flung them down the stream. lie write of things unseen. -he&#xD;
pierce the veil that separates the spiritual -)nd natural world, when&#xD;
he could net even read a simple village girl ! The attempt seernf&#xD;
blasplIemious. and he shuddere!I as he walked rapidly back to the&#xD;
house.&#xD;
How long the family breakfast seemed! Endless the series of hot&#xD;
corneakes which Phif would bring in that morning. Then, too, the&#xD;
old fellow had picked soime tame blackberries, the first 4of the season,&#xD;
jet black. luscious. tenipting': they lay in a basket of snowy porce-&#xD;
lain, and Master Edward mu'st taste anti praise them.&#xD;
At last it was over. Mr. Talbot took up his newspaper; Virginia&#xD;
busied herself with her housekeeping, and Edward was agusn at lib-&#xD;
erty. He went to his chamber. took out his writing materials, spread&#xD;
Mr. Stone's letter before him, and sat down to think. Wearisome as&#xD;
&#xD;
the restraint of the breakfast-table had been. it had proved of service&#xD;
to Edward, in calming his feelings, .and enabling him to analyze their&#xD;
cause. lie saw that his jealousy might have no foundation, and&#xD;
bamed himself for his want oftrrus u  t--    -th   k&#xD;
all. to end this uncertainty as sooen as possible. He wrote a letter&#xD;
to Mr. Campbell, assuring him of the respectability of Mr. Stone's&#xD;
family and his own high character. and closed it unsealed in an&#xD;
envelope. directed to the worthy Rector.&#xD;
Then. after a few moments' hesitation, he poured out to Minnie&#xD;

&#xD;
mer Chaplain, a mild, easy tempered man,  been snubbed by the&#xD;
hedsurgeon, patronized by the young doctors, scoded by the&#xD;
steward and nurses into a typhoid fever, of which he died.&#xD;
The fir aadvantage the new Chaplai obtained over his predeces.&#xD;
&amp;amp;-w, was a purey physicalOne. Il tall, manly figure, and the long&#xD;
stride with which he passed through the close entries, ad down the&#xD;
dirty stairs, gave the household an idea of the dignity of his office&#xD;
which had never entered their heads before. Bt familiarty would&#xD;
have soon worn away this effect had oet an incident occurred the&#xD;
third naorning after his arrival, which placed his authority upon a&#xD;
surer basis. Happening into the operating-room just s the chluro-&#xD;
form had lulled into insensibility a row of patients, he found a young&#xD;
doctor on the point of amputating Joe Hudiwn's arm, because the&#xD;
label upon the bed ran thus: -&#xD;
&#xD;
11&#xD;
&#xD;
cGo4mo&#xD;
&#xD;
" Stop! stopI here is some mistake! It is Hudson's leg you&#xD;
must cut off; it has been shattered by a shell." id Edward, roused&#xD;
out of his usual calmness at the danger the Maine backwoodsman&#xD;
ran of losing one of his strong arms.&#xD;
Dr. Blinkinsop turned round angrily: he stuttered, and his excite-&#xD;
ment was an additional impediment to his utterance.&#xD;
" Damn it, Parson! con - con - con - confound your im - im&#xD;
im -" and the Daoctor stamped his fut--t in is rage at nut being able&#xD;
to finish his speech.&#xD;
" Impudence," said the Chaplain with a bow, coming to his as-&#xD;
sistance.&#xD;
"God d -n you    Mind1your own1)b-Is -b"'&#xD;
"Business;:." and Edward bowed again. -Suppose all this is&#xD;
understood without your taking the triubls. to express it, and let us&#xD;
come to the point. I intend :o further interference with your pr-&#xD;
fessional duties, than to prevent your taking off an arm where it&#xD;
should be a leg.'&#xD;
" I sup -sup--suppose I can read, sir."&#xD;
" Can you ?9" said the Chaplain, as if'he had doubted the fact.&#xD;
" If that s the case, this matter can be easily settled ; " and running&#xD;
his eye rapidly over the rows of men before him, he saw Hudson's&#xD;
label on Pat O'Riley's bed, and exchanged them. Pat, he knew, was&#xD;
to hare his arm amputated below the elbow, for he had spent a great&#xD;
deal of time in trying to reconcile the poor fellow to his loss.&#xD;
Dr. Blinkinsop hastily advanced, as if he meant to turn the Chap-&#xD;
&#xD;
his out of the room; but as he drew near, he probably saw that his&#xD;
antagisthad the advantage in height and breadth of chest, for he&#xD;
thougt beter of it, and said fiercely -&#xD;
II - allow no one to ic - dictate tome but Dr.Hig&#xD;
gins: he wr - wr -writes out his orders, and I - I- obeyt ;&#xD;
and its none of your b - b - business, as I said b-before.&#xD;
A footstep was at this moment heard in the entry, and Edw'rd,&#xD;
turning round, addressed Dr. Higgins in his blandest manner.&#xD;
"4Doctor, a slight mistake has occurred. Your label for Pat O'Ri-&#xD;
ley got upon Hudson's bed; in perceiving it, and exchanging them,&#xD;
I have incurred Dr. Blinkinsop's displeasure. The emergency of the&#xD;
case must be my excuse; I leave the matter in your hands; and&#xD;
Edward walked away, leaving Dr. Higgins too confounded at his&#xD;
own carelessness to speak.&#xD;
"6Damn him, he finds out everything !' muttered Dr. Higgins,&#xD;
when the Chaplain was out of hearing. "Go to work, Blinkinsop;&#xD;
what do you stand staring at me for? I can't keep patients insensible&#xD;
for you and Mr. Talbot to quarrel over.&#xD;
"4No, sir, but 1 - I, I beg pardon, sir, but I don't know about&#xD;
Hudson, wh - wh - wh -"&#xD;
"Amputate his head, of course." said Dr. Higgins, with bitter&#xD;
irony. "If yours had not been so empty, you would have corrected&#xD;
the mistake yourself. Such accidents,"' said the doctor, recovering&#xD;
his setf-pos&amp;amp;session. '" must happen sometimes when there is a great&#xD;
press of work, but they should never go out of the profession, sir.&#xD;
This reproof completed the confusion and excitement of the unfor-&#xD;
tunate Blinkinsop; seeing him quite unfit for his work, the head&#xD;
surgeon performed the operations himself in the neatest manner, for&#xD;
his skill was equal to his carelessness.&#xD;
After dinner, Dr. liggins eyed Edward wistfully, and then during&#xD;
up his chair to his side, he said, with a swaggering air, intended to&#xD;
hide the shame he could not help feeling: "By the by, Mr. Talbot,&#xD;
I owe you my thanks: that little mistake in the operating-room this&#xD;
morning - von know to what I allude -- might have - Blinkinsop&#xD;
is such a fool - mi-ht have -ledI to some unpleasant consequences,&#xD;

itbhappened.                        -p, hnvuIl&#xD;

guard against i repetition.''o                     b   m&#xD;
"Yes, as you say, sir. guard against it, and theoctor. becoming&#xD;
more embarrassed, took out his ciuar-case and offered Edward a&#xD;
cigar, which he declined. Th head surgeon then lighted oethise&#xD;

lain'' judgment and wishes, enabled him to work a gradual&#xD;
vement. Though the managers of the establishment were&#xD;
efposed to all ventilation, a new window was cut in such a way as&#xD;
to make a circulation of air through the principal wards, hy whose&#xD;
orders, or at whose expense, was never known. The dirty, slip-shod&#xD;
nuses soon learned to dread the Chaplain's satirical compliments,&#xD;
and grew neater in their dress, and gentler in their ways, now that&#xD;
his watchful eye seemed always upon them. The steward, to no&#xD;
longer dared eat up all the delicacies sent to the patients, and though&#xD;
a stout man, with a first-rate.digestion, he felt better, now that sote&#xD;
check was put upon his consumption of currant jelly and blackberry&#xD;

Would 1 - bUt it mut 1lw all the w tv alfrPennsylvania Avenue&#xD;

Any letters for Edward Talbot&#xD;
Ariy letters fOr Dr. Higgins ?&#xD;
A letter was handed him in a great yellow envelope, directed by a&#xD;
man whe. valuing the est of' his paper. thought it best to cover,  th&#xD;
sundry capitals and flourishes, the p r'ius surface. The Chaplain&#xD;
looked at the sprawling letters,,and the eught how badly they were&#xD;
&#xD;
made; he looked at the yellow envelope, and thought how vulgar it&#xD;
was, and then he decided he hated the letter and Dr. Higgins too,&#xD;
and wished his conscience would permit him to throw it into the&#xD;
gutter, it would be such a satisfaction to see it floating down in the&#xD;
dirty water, falling in with all the refuse, and whirled away with it&#xD;
at last into the great city sewer. But he could not allow himself the&#xD;
indulgence,so he buttoned it up tightly in his coat-pocket, determined&#xD;
not to look at it again until he got home.&#xD;
It now struck him for the first time, how fearfully profane the hack-&#xD;
drivers were, how many drunken soldiers lurked round the corners,&#xD;
what a continual rattle the wagons kept up driving by, how glaringly&#xD;
the goods looked in the shop windows, and with what a surly air&#xD;
their owners regarded the passers-by, and altogether, what a nasty,&#xD;
wicked, noisy, tasteless, disagreeable place Washington was. A&#xD;
man met him on the steps of the hospital, and wanted him to come&#xD;
up stairs and comfort a poor fellow who was suffering a great&#xD;
from the effects of an amputation. He thought the man need not&#xD;
have bothered him just then. and I am afraid he wished the soldiers&#xD;
would nout always steud for him. when they wanted help. "I have&#xD;
trouble enough of my own." he said to himself, as he walked along.&#xD;
and flung the hateful~ letter down on the table in the medical room.&#xD;
For all this, though. when he was once up stairs. and seated beside&#xD;
the backwoo . ;man, whose pallid face and restless tosings showed&#xD;
the pain he was ashamed to complain of, he inquired how he felt just&#xD;
as kindly, real to him jut as long, and explained to hir just as&#xD;
patiently, as if these thoughts had never come into his head. By&#xD;
and by J1ev Hudson fell asleep, with one rough band in Edward's,&#xD;
and his heal beht towards him on his pillow in an attitude of atten-&#xD;
tion.    then the Chaplain softly got up. and withdrawing himself&#xD;
gently from the sleper's grasp. walked down the room, speaking a&#xD;
kind wf rdl here ande there. and at last sat down by pltor Pats -e0.&#xD;
A rd  ch, vtr Honor. and how is a poor dli'il like me .to writetto&#xD;
his wife' and childers. now that his arm is cut clean off at the&#xD;
ilbow'd&#xD;
Not that Pat could have written any better before his wund.&#xD;
as Edward very well knew. but he was c'arefnl Tot to make any sug-&#xD;
gestion  of  the  kind.  whil' Pat,  ditti . , hi'  un(  n'4cious  buls,&#xD;
watchedl the Chaplain's :. - as it milved rapilly ov-r themafper. and&#xD;
felt with pride that this wet part of the sac'rt'ce he had mde for his&#xD;
adopted country.  When 'Pat's letter was folded and directed, the&#xD;
hour had come for the hospital morning service.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXIX.&#xD;
A  atua] sights lose by repetition their value in our eyes; this&#xD;
is a weakness common to all mortals, and Pete McClacker cannot&#xD;
therefore be blamed, that, when he found, just as surely as hie took&#xD;
down the brown shutters at the stroke of eight, there was the Chap.&#xD;
lain coming out of the opposite door, he ceased to take any notice of&#xD;
. No.r did Pete lose his appetite for his bread and butter, or care&#xD;
the less for his marbles and mud-pies, because Edward's step was&#xD;
now flurried, his face pushed and anxious, when he took his daily&#xD;
walk to the post-office, while on his return he came along slowly,&#xD;
looking pale and weary, as if from a long journey.&#xD;
The Chaplain had been a little more than three weeks at the Hos-&#xD;
pital. wben one morning he walked the street with so firm and deter-&#xD;
mined a stride, that some of the foot passengers stepped aside to let&#xD;
himepass, while others turned round and gazed after him.  Even&#xD;
Pete's attention was arrested. He had indated his cheeks, and his&#xD;
dirty little fists were raised in the very act of striking out the air,&#xD;
when involuntarily they fell by his side; his mouth opened with&#xD;
wonder as he thought, " Bully for you, Parson ; what 's in the wind&#xD;
now"&#xD;
Mr. Talbot passed rapidly into his study, unconscious of the obser-&#xD;
vaon hedattracted, closed and locked the door. Now, then, he was&#xD;
alone, and he would face the misery that he knew was in store for him.&#xD;
Drawing out a letter from his pocket he opened it. It was as he&#xD;
taught, one of thanks from Mr. Stone, thanks for Edward's letter to&#xD;
Mr. Campbell, which the grateful Rect4or said had already worked a&#xD;
charm in his favor.  Minnie must have received his letter, which&#xD;
went by th same post as this which Stone had answered.&#xD;
How often had he said to himself, during this last three weeks,&#xD;
any certainty is better than the doubts that torture me." But it&#xD;
did not seem so now . he would gladly have gone back to the one&#xD;
little hope of yesterday. forlorn and faded as it was.  Le smiled at&#xD;
his own anguish.  Manws heart was made for woman's foot-ball;&#xD;
why should one rebel against the common lot:?&#xD;
the dear delicate creatures are rolt str4)ng enough to toss about&#xD;
leather stuffed with straw, but they can strike the liing quverng&#xD;
flesh, a sure blow.           .&#xD;
Then came the thought that he had given up so much for God's&#xD;
service, - ho me, friends. reputati. n. reser-ving to) hims,-If one little&#xD;
childish heart, and ni 1w Heaven grudged him that. But why blame&#xD;
Heaven for his own stupidity aid folly.  Hie who prided 'himself&#xD;
upon his penetration, hal proved a dolt and an idiot.-deceived by a&#xD;
country girl, supplanted bv a country parsn. Then his mortification&#xD;
died away in the anguish of his de'S'alatiOnr1.&#xD;
All of us remember a smile or a to.ar that stirred us more deeply&#xD;
than years of our present life. Anid though Mrs. Smith is as pleas-&#xD;
-ant a picture of matronly beauty as one could desire to look upn&#xD;
the bluish on her cheek has long since become a perennial bloom. She&#xD;
&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
n our changing our boots when they are wet, takes nwe&#xD;
not travel without our nightcape, and yet we sometimes&#xD;
heave a sgh over a memory of the past, a face that brightened at&#xD;
OWr coming and grw sad when we said-good-by; reproaches that&#xD;
counted a a loss every moment of our absence, and joy that nestled&#xD;
in the sunshine of our presence. "Pshaw! what folly! " we ex-&#xD;
claim, and find in our newspapers, our account at the bankers, our&#xD;
well-arranged house and pleasant garden, enjoyments much better&#xD;
suited to our time of life.&#xD;
But the Chaplain was too young for these soli4 comforts: had he&#xD;
possessed them, they would have been no consolation to him, as hd&#xD;
paced up and down the narrow room. struggling with this new sense&#xD;
of loneliness. To whom could he confide his faults, his repinings,&#xD;
his strivings, - who could know all his weakness, and yet trust in&#xD;
his strength ?  Not his father, whom he loved and honored; not&#xD;
Virginia, who was as a sister to him; not one of his friends, though&#xD;
they were warm and true (with his most satirical smile upon his&#xD;
lips): not Mrs. Stone, the Rector's wife.&#xD;
If any of our readers chance to take an interest in Edward, they&#xD;
will probably feel the same disappointment in him at this time, that he&#xD;
did in himself. Does a firm Christian faith, a fife of self-denial, prepare&#xD;
one no better than this to bear a woman's fickleness ? Is this mean,&#xD;
jealous, doting fool I now see. my true self, with gown and sur-&#xD;
plice stripped off? Thackeray's witty sketch occurred to him, of&#xD;
Loui ' le Grand in royal robes, with sword and sceptre, looking every&#xD;
inch a kin, and Louis Capet. bald, thin, wizen, supporting himself&#xD;
with his staff, and gazing with awe upon the high-heeled boots, im-&#xD;
posing curled wig, and ermine-cloak, which, set up by his side, al-&#xD;
lowed you no doubt as to which was le Grand Monarque, and which&#xD;
the man. The moral pierced the Chaplain to the soul; all the ser-&#xD;
mons he had ever read or ever preached. had never struck his con-&#xD;
science so forcibly as these few pencil-marks of the great satirist, re-&#xD;
membered at this moment.&#xD;
He turned for help to the books upin his study table. Here were&#xD;
noble aspirations, words of faith and aretness, records of spirits&#xD;
who had struggledI. and not in vain. to rise above e arthly passions&#xD;
but these could not aid him now. This lMttle must be fought alone.&#xD;
Not in an hour, not in a lay could he hope f1' r victory: weeks of&#xD;
fierce conflict must be endured, -a desperate wrestling of the soul&#xD;
with God.-&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;

CHAPTER XL.&#xD;
Rrwozs of the fashionable world sometimes reached the United&#xD;
Metropolitan liospital, and through a friend's letter dated Saratga,&#xD;
Edward heard of the sensation Rosalie U ppermanr was m Kig there.&#xD;
The writer seemed fairly bewitched with her. No matter what sub-&#xD;
ct he began a paragraph with, Miss Rosalie came in before he could&#xD;

song.&#xD;
One day an envelope was handed to the Chaplain; it contained&#xD;
this card.&#xD;
&#xD;
The date was omitted: but this did not surprise Edward, remem.&#xD;
bering as he did that it had taken Goethe several years to persuade&#xD;
Bettina into) a perfectly'free confession in regard to her date; nor&#xD;
did it require taany minutes for him to decide that the present must&#xD;
be the time understood by so ephemeral a creature as Misc Rosalie.&#xD;
With the pale., stern face that he had worn for many a day, but&#xD;
with some diutterin.rs about the heart, Edward kncked that same&#xD;
afternoon at 16 Willard's.&#xD;
" Come in," said Mr. Ipperman. in his most querul 'us tone.&#xD;
The old gentleman was standing before .the I"oking-aass. with his&#xD;
hAt in one hanl, while with the other he tugged upon his limp shirt-&#xD;
collar, and triedI to impart t4 it .some of his own vigr ;foor though&#xD;
he persuadted hiilif he was a great invalid, to others he looked the&#xD;
picture of green old age. The Chaplain saw at a glance that he had&#xD;
coJ.meI' too %kon1 for Mi.s Rosalie: the flush upon her face was some-&#xD;
thing more than the soft b.lush that would have greeted him a few&#xD;
moments later: but to her uncle his appearance seemed a relief.&#xD;
The greetings over, he turned to his niece. and said -&#xD;
l Really, this shirt collar IlPes not lO'k fit to go to Dr. Jollup's, and&#xD;
it 's the tiirl to-day. Wat weath r: I fee! as if I were between&#xD;
the feather-Lwds 'if a wat. r-.ure estabLahmernt. The walk might be&#xD;
too much for me : so, in- MNr. Talbot has coni  I think I will defer&#xD;
my visit to the PDet)r' until to -morrow, -hey. Rtsali'  -&#xD;
"As you pleae. sir, if y1-  think it will be safe : but veu know&#xD;
you have taken your last pill."&#xD;
The old genitleman's fat clouded over. but he said in a loud tone,&#xD;
as it t'' reassure himself-&#xD;
But I have the Ir'ps. R  ali. - I havce the drops, child : and the&#xD;
dr' p- with ut the pills may d( f or a si;le night."&#xD;
'Dear Uncle, the chambermaid threw down the bottle of drops&#xD;
and broke it, this morning."&#xD;
" The devil take her. and yiu too: Excuse me. Mr. Talbot: a&#xD;
man must swear sometimes. And why could n't you tell me of this&#xD;
before, child ? "&#xD;
-- I have just thought of it, uncle."&#xD;

&#xD;
" That's the literal truth," said the Chaplain, Sou oece, for -Mr.&#xD;
Upperman was a little deaf.&#xD;
" The deuce you haveN " continued the testy old gentleman.&#xD;
"Confound your coolness; you knew I could not sleep without&#xD;
them. I beg your pardon. Mr. Talbot. I am obliged to give vent&#xD;
to my feelings : it would be suicide, my dear sir, not to do it. I&#xD;
live, as you know, in constant danger of apoplexy, and an explosion&#xD;
of this kind is a great safety-valve.I&#xD;
Here, the old gentleman blew his nose violently, as if he hoped&#xD;
this would also prove a safety-valve.&#xD;
"Fortunately." said the Chaplain, with his satirical smile. - I am&#xD;
one of Pharaoh's lean kine, since this is an indulgence my pro-&#xD;
fession would not allow of."&#xD;
At another time, Edward would have offered to go to Dr. Jollup&#xD;
in Mr. Upperma-n's stead, for he really pitied his vexed and heated&#xD;
state : but, to tell our readers the truth. though the Chaplain was far&#xD;
from confessing it to himself, the ti'-I-e'Ie so much desired by Miss&#xD;
Rosalie, was irresistibly attractive to him. also:- and it was a relief&#xD;
to both when the door at last closed upon Mr. Upperman.&#xD;
" Do vou blame me very much for -you know what . ad Rosa-&#xD;

but to be frank with you, Miss Rosalie, there are others whom I&#xD;
value more."&#xD;
"Miss Campbell, for instance," said Rosalie, tauntingly.&#xD;
"Yes," answered the Chaplain, in his sternest tone and without&#xD;
wincing, though every nerve thrilled with pain. "What can you&#xD;
tell me of Miss Campbell. Is she engaged to Mr. Stone?"&#xD;
Rosalie. embarrassed. "Yes, I believe so, --n6, not yet, I think,&#xD;

with-"&#xD;
If ou don't believe what I say, I won't talk to you any more;"&#xD;
and she turned her shoulder upon Edward.&#xD;
The Chaplain did not seem at all hurt at this, but he sighed&#xD;
wearily. as if he felt how hard a task it would be to extract any re-&#xD;
liable information from the little coquette at his side.  Then there&#xD;
cate over him such a longing to know the worst, that he found him-&#xD;
self speaking in a tone more earnest than he ever supposed he should&#xD;
use to Rosaie Upperman.   Laying his hand on her shoulder he&#xD;
said --h&#xD;
" Rosalie. if under these folds of muslin, and hows of ribbon. and&#xD;
bands of steel, there beats a human heart, you cannot refuse to&#xD;
answer me now.    D)o y u honestly believe that Minnie Campbell&#xD;
loves. - Pshaw ! what do you women know of love. - do you believe&#xD;
she is pleased with Mr. Stone's attentions, and will engage herself to&#xD;
him?"&#xD;
Rosalie trembled with a'ritation. and at last faltered out.  'I did&#xD;
not believe it at first, - I wrpt it totease y tu': but -I do now."'&#xD;
"'-The proilf. - give me -zorne proof.&#xD;
Rosalie rse. went into hor chamber, which ajoined the partir toand&#xD;
returnedl with a letter frorxs Minnie. *,he opened it, and pointin.g to&#xD;
a sentence. rve it to Elward to read.&#xD;
"You are wrong in 1pposing I no linger care to hear Mr. Talbot&#xD;
raised. I shall always take a friend's interest in all that concerns&#xD;
him.&#xD;
"And this lash under the friend means, in a woman's hiernglvph-&#xD;
ics"said the Chaplain.'- simply a friend, I suppose, nothing&#xD;
" Yes." answered Rosalie : and she watched eagerly its effect.&#xD;
Such a pallor spread 'over Mr. Talbot's face that" even his lips&#xD;
became colorless, and trembled visibly. Flinging down the letter he&#xD;
walked to the window : there was the dusty, noisy world moving on,&#xD;
&#xD;
mTANNSR&#xD;
&#xD;
regardless of what he suffered. f[low it jarred upon his ner'eT to se&#xD;
this Perfect unconsciousness, this carplessnes hs indifference to&#xD;
his fate.&#xD;
He was startled by a low sob, and turning round, saw that Rosalie&#xD;
had laid her head down upon the arm of the sofa, and was weeping.&#xD;
Was it sympathy for him?  le bent down, and said in his gentlest&#xD;
tones-&#xD;
"Vhat troubles you, Rosalie?"&#xD;
"I cannot bear to see you suffer -I did not think -!I will undo,&#xD;
it  give the letter back:- " and she raised her head, and clasped her&#xD;
hands as if entreating his forgiveness for the pain she had given&#xD;
him.&#xD;
Passion added a depth to her beauty ; her loveliness seemed to&#xD;
penetrate through his senses to his inmost being, in a way it had&#xD;
never du-ne be-fore, but he was very far from understanding the true&#xD;
meaning of her words.  le knew she was fond of him, as fond per-&#xD;
haps, a her nature could be of any one: her triumphs at Saratoga,&#xD;
too, seemed some excuse for her power over him. He looked at her&#xD;
without speaking for full five minutes, - but I do not believe an angel&#xD;
sIliedits white wings by flying through that silent room.  At last&#xD;
he broke the spell, took one of Rosalie's. hands in his, and said-&#xD;
e bDo not blameyourself: yu have done the kindest thing to tell&#xD;
me.   Y~u feel for me, I kntOw,  It would be a great comfort if I&#xD;
could, entirely trust you. - if you were as true as you are beau-&#xD;

Rosalie did not withdraw her hand; involuntarily her delicate little&#xD;
fingers seem to twine themselves about his, with a force that he&#xD;
could nAt shake off.  If he had hoped this attack on her want of&#xD;
truth woultI. bringi one of her usual saucy retorts, and release him&#xD;
from the snares she was spreading over him, he hoped in vain. There&#xD;
was a sad, wistful expression in her eyes. her lips moved, but not a&#xD;
sound camne fri  them   she loked as if her life were trembling on&#xD;
the balance of that moment; her attitude was so .graceful and sub-&#xD;
missive, that. ha I the Chaplain believed his s-ul's salvation depended&#xD;

did next. Stopping. he kissed Rosalie upon the forehead, and then&#xD;

IT was   prettily furished Aitting-room, with a sunny exposure,&#xD;
stand of flowers in the windows, and vases filled with bright&#xD;
autumnal leaves',upon the mantel-piece and table. Of its two inmates,&#xD;
one could be read at a glance : professional nurse was wrtten on her&#xD;
dignified face and pursed-up mouth, and when she spoke, the false,&#xD;
wheedling tones of her voice reiterated the fact. The other, poor&#xD;
child, could be admired, pitied, feared, as her moods varied, but&#xD;
never understood. She was lying back among the cushions of the&#xD;
couch, her cheeks flushed, her eyes flashing with unnatural brilliancy,&#xD;
singing snatches'of Itahan songs. while she tossed up a small India&#xD;
rubber ball, sometimes making it rebound from the back of her hand,&#xD;
and sometimes catching it in the palm, but never letting it fall.&#xD;
"Cue  ora C'  I mean what hour is it, Mrs. Posset?" and she sang&#xD;
on gayly.&#xD;

This. Mrs. Posset, who was quickwi'tted. interpreted to be an order&#xD;
to consult her patient's watch, which hung' in the ad'oiingchamber:&#xD;
but before she returned, the lady's mood had chdiand. Her hal had&#xD;
dropped to the ground, and her spirits had fallen with it. She was&#xD;
now leaning forward with her elbows upon her knees, and her chin&#xD;
resting in one hand, while with the other she pulled her long black&#xD;
hair in the wildest confusion over her neck and fe. Still singing ,&#xD;
her tones were as sad as they had been gay a moment before.&#xD;

&#xD;
looked up beseechingly into Posset's face, stretching out her thin,&#xD;
feverish hands.&#xD;
The nurse took a pot from the flower-stand, containing a tea rose-&#xD;
bush, and placed it on a little table by her side. "La rua I is&#xD;
belzua ! la bella delle belle !" and she smiled with delight, kissing the&#xD;
buds : there were two, one closely shut in its protecting calix, and&#xD;
another just ready to burst forth. while above these a fullblown rose&#xD;
towered. in all th'e majesty of perfect loveliness. Laying her cheek&#xD;
timidly against the open rose, its coolness refreshed her burning skin,&#xD;
and sie soon pressed it so closely. that the petals were loosened and&#xD;
fell ene 1yv one to the ground. At this she jumped up, tossed back&#xD;
her hair from her eyes, and remained standing far a few moments as&#xD;
motionless as if she were in a tableau. Then she began to cast&#xD;
suspicious glances behind, and on every side.&#xD;
Posset had dropped a stitch in that eternal blue stocking of hers,&#xD;
and was standing Us- the window trying to pick it up. all unmindful&#xD;
of her charge. So the ladv,seeing nothing to intimidate her. seized&#xD;
the rosebush ly its stem, shook it violently, crying out, -- Per beUs&#xD;
Che .4n, nli fmi piace?s" and dashed it upon the carpet.&#xD;
When she saw the pot broken, and the uprooted rose lying at her&#xD;
feet. she lee1an to weep :' but whether from real sorrow, or to disarm&#xD;
Mrs. Po.set's anger, it was impossible to tell. She certainly sobbed&#xD;
vi.lently. while that worthy female, with an acid countenance, which&#xD;
made io . sure she, had long since justified her name. by curdling any&#xD;
milk of human kindness there might have been originally in her com-&#xD;

handkerchief, a flash of mirth could t4o detected in thgm. As the last&#xD;
dustpan full of earth was carried off by the hardly used Posset, the&#xD;
lady ran tso the piano. Her fingers strayed over the keys. striking&#xD;
here and there a chord, and then began a sweet, sad melody, so sad&#xD;
that each note seemed tear-laden. The time was broken. the subject&#xD;
stran-lv on.ewifused : bits remembered here and there. fragmentary,&#xD;

while a third class give a gripe indicting pain. without producing&#xD;
cordiality. There is, however, a clasp, as Bulwer somewhere sars,&#xD;
"which recalls the classic trust in the faith of the right hand."&#xD;
These thoughts passed through Mr. Talbot's brain, as he was&#xD;

The fir-t w' .k of Ella's imprisonment had passed, when she stood&#xD;
looking at h-r husband intently one Thursday nrmug, without&#xD;
speak in:.  At Lat she boke the science with, "How do you feel,&#xD;

that I could not bear it, and sent him out to the stable to make a&#xD;
sketch from nature."&#xD;
" The darling little fellow! The Prince has a good seat, Ella.&#xD;
Esty knew how a man, should ride. But how droll in him to begin&#xD;
to paint the horse before his legs were done."&#xD;
"Oh. he always did that., As fast as he got a piece drawn, he&#xD;
painted it."&#xD;
"And this. I suppose. is the Princess who burnt up because&#xD;
she did not swallow the last pomegranate seed: the best case of&#xD;
spontaneous combustion on record. She is certainly of the Amazon&#xD;
order of beauty.&#xD;
Nonsense. oIIrace: where are your eves? This is the genie that&#xD;

I knew you would think Estv- had your talent the genie No, is&#xD;
not s.. bad. when you know what be is meant for."&#xD;
Ani so the parental criticism went on. inter-pers-ed with tears and&#xD;
laughter. And now that Ella lire unburdiei her heart. she had so&#xD;
many bright speeche-. SO many pretty tricks to relate of th'ir Iviy.&#xD;
that the shirt Novenier dy:iv. which' was shorter still iii ths-r dri.&#xD;
drew to a close. It had l't'omte alrnst dark, but. the smoky kero-&#xD;
sene lamp was not vet jj hted when a gentle knock was heard at&#xD;
the dor.&#xD;
" Come in,"said Ella: and a tall figure in black. evidently a lady.&#xD;
entered. Her air was stately and high-bred, but a thick ekpe veil&#xD;
concealed her features. She hel l a basket in her hand, which she&#xD;
gave to Ella. and said -" Here are some little comforts Vou cannot&#xD;

&#xD;
back on his pillow and laughed. " Ella, my bandage should be cooled,&#xD;
you neglectful creature; why don't you come here do it. Shall&#xD;
I send for the lady in black to nurse me?"&#xD;
But his wife took no notice of him.&#xD;
"dMy pillows are in such a mess! Can't you beat them up. See&#xD;
here*" -andid Standish seemed to be sliding out of bed.&#xD;
This would not do : so EHa drew near with a dignified step, and&#xD;
took hold of the pillows, but was instantly caught by llorace s left&#xD;
arm, and held until she promised she would beg the mysterious lady,&#xD;
the next time she came, to unveil in his presence.&#xD;
Although the'rough Doctor uttered many sarcasms at the happi-&#xD;
ness of the young couple, and prophesied that some discovery of&#xD;
incompatibility of temper would certainly follow all this billing and&#xD;
cotowg, still. it was with feelings of genuine astomushment. that as&#xD;
he appr* ache1 the door in making his rounds one notrniag, he heard&#xD;
Horace's veice sayintr in a tone of angry authority, "You shall do as&#xD;
I tell vou. Ella : thi: is n4t a thing that you can judge of: my hoaor&#xD;
is c'nccrned in it. al I I will be obeyed.&#xD;
Aid so you ,hAl in everything but this, Horace."&#xD;
"Everything but what I want. That 's always the way with&#xD;
women. 1Such sweet submissive words until you want them to yield&#xD;
to your better judzrment. and then  -&#xD;
-But. loraev, it 's quixotic, - it 's muadness;: no man in his senses&#xD;
would proper it.&#xD;
lhoity-tvity I' cried the Doctor, bursting in. " What 's all this&#xD;
"Mrs. Standish wants to worry my fever hack&#xD;
"Mr. Standish wants to kill himself, by going into one of the con-&#xD;
demnxed cells!&#xD;
And so he shall, madam, and be hung, too. in the' place o&#xD;

felt 111race'f pulse. 'Too quick, -skin hot too My patient&#xD;

Ella looked imploringly at th.' loctor, but did not speak. Doctor&#xD;

Standish handed the doctor ,i slip of paper.&#xD;

IN the Washington Star of the 23d of February, 18t, might be&#xD;
read the following paragraph.&#xD;
"The s.)mewhat mnuntonl us -zAcial life of the metropolis, was ram-t&#xD;

into a warm pressure of the hand, as she said, ' You here ; how glad&#xD;

right arm of his belongs to Art. Touching, isn't it? And Salisbury&#xD;
thinks he will always wear that funny box, for all the world like a&#xD;
knife tray, whenever he goes into action. Do you think so?" the&#xD;
lady paused for breath, and the stranger hastened to say, "That since&#xD;
Lieutenant Salisbury had shown himself so intimately acquainted&#xD;
with Colonel Standish, he should not presume to differ from him on&#xD;
the important point of the knife tray; " and gliding rapidly by her&#xD;
with a bow, he hoped to reach his host, but was again disappointed.&#xD;
He could not penetrate the circle about Horace, which was appar-&#xD;
ently urging hi to do something which he was trying to escape&#xD;
from.&#xD;
" What is all this fuss about ? " asked the stranger of his friend&#xD;
Barclay, whom he came in contact with at this moment.&#xD;
Barclay was an exquisite of the first water, whose gloves and cravat-&#xD;
tie were faultless. Faultless, too, was his kind heart: but as the&#xD;
gloves and cravat-tie stood first in the estimation of their owner, his&#xD;
friends unconsci usly fell into his way of thinking. Of his head, it&#xD;
need only be said that it was not so heavy as to disturb the balance&#xD;
of his light heels, as he glided over the floor, revolving, reversing,&#xD;
to the right, to the left, now skimming rapidly forwa. and now&#xD;
gliding backward, but never allowing the g    rfo   of his part-&#xD;
ner's dress to be injured by contact with the elu *  couple who&#xD;
encumbered the room. Such was Barcla?      Sprig's words, in the&#xD;
Book of Bubbles, define his position in Washington society.&#xD;
*   " I can't chatter or talk. but I'Im cock of the walk,&#xD;
For I lead the great German Cotillon."&#xD;
"I can't quite make out," answered Barclay, "what the fuss is&#xD;
about: but they want the Colonel to sing something. Yoi know&#xD;
he 's a capital fellow for a song. Listen, and let 's hear what that&#xD;
Ii vely Miss Leslie is saving to him."&#xD;
"Dear Colonel Standish, this is Washington's birthday. and I am&#xD;
sure. if his spirit is hovering over us. it would love so to hear that&#xD;
Ode: and besides (with a coquettish glance), I will play the accom-&#xD;
paniment for you."&#xD;
Horace laughed. "Your arguments are irresistible, Miss Leslie:"&#xD;
and instantly offering her his arm. led her to the piano. The lady&#xD;
struck a few ch'r-ls. and then Standish's rich tenor voice filled the&#xD;
room with that stirring Ode which was. sang by the union party in&#xD;
Charleston on the 4th tof July. 131, when nullification was rife.&#xD;
Hail, our country's natal morn!&#xD;
Hail, our spreading kindred born!&#xD;
Hail, thou banner. not yet tcirn'&#xD;
Waving o'er the free!&#xD;
While thi" day in festire throng,&#xD;
Millions swell the patriot's song,&#xD;
Shanl we not the note prolong?&#xD;
Hallowed jubilee.&#xD;
" Who would sever Freedomn's shrine?&#xD;

It is impossible to say whether the Father of his Country, indulg-&#xD;
ing in the birthday excursion Miss Leslie ascribed to him, enjoyed&#xD;
the music. but it is certain the embodied spirits present applauded&#xD;
so loudly, that Horace was glad to break away from them and greet&#xD;
the stranger. whom he caught sight of at this moment.&#xD;
"Come ito the dancing-room," he whispered, "and we 11 have a&#xD;
nice chat."&#xD;
Scarcely had they found a quiet corner, however, when our hero&#xD;
was called away by a message from his wife; some guests had&#xD;
arrived, to whom he must be introduced. About the stranger, as he&#xD;
leaned against the wall, watching the dancers, there gathered Barclay,&#xD;
and so-me two or three other beaux.&#xD;
First Beau. " Barclav, it 's time you were married."&#xD;
Time enough for that, say I:" and Barclay twisted his moustache.&#xD;
Seend Beau. "No time 'ike the present. There 's Miss Mow-&#xD;
brav, - she 's handsome, and -rich t : wAy don't you try yvur luck&#xD;
with ther ~&#xD;
B.arcav. "Oh! not fir w orlls. 'Porn my word, there 's some-&#xD;
thing about that girl makes ul   shudder. Sthe 's strong-mded,&#xD;
I think."&#xD;
second Beau. "Nonsense. Barclay: that 's an idle excuse. You&#xD;
don't know what strong-minded means.&#xD;
Barclay. -- Yes, I do: don't I ' (appealing to his friend, whom&#xD;
he see'me'l to have brought to Washington, to speak for him.)&#xD;
Stranger  ". You know what vou mean by it. - that she prefers&#xD;
to make her little excursions without an escort, a carpet-bag in one&#xD;
hand, and an umbrella in the other." c&#xD;
Barclay.   - Yet. so I do, that s a fact. What a sharp fellow you&#xD;
are!  I met her going to Baltimore, ut as you -a aIt    ek  a&#xD;
when I offered to take care of her, she let me know tha  h   a&#xD;
quite as much at home in the cars as I could be."&#xD;
SFirst Beau. " But that 's such a trifle, a fellow should n't let i&#xD;
interfere with his settling himself." .&#xD;
Barclay. "Yes he shoul t.o, sh'i uth?&#xD;
&#xD;

STANDISH.&#xD;
&#xD;
STANDISH.&#xD;
&#xD;
Stranger. "Cela depende; there is no position without its advan-&#xD;
tages. You remember the old story, -it's in Joe Miller, I dare&#xD;
say, -of the deathbed of the man who had married one of these&#xD;
strong-minded females. 'My friend,' said the clergyman, 'this is a&#xD;
fearful journey you are about to take; are you prepared to meet the&#xD;
King of Terrors ?' 'Please God, sir, I am,' replied the dying man,&#xD;
'seeing as I 've lived with the Queen so long.'''o&#xD;
While the three young men were laughing at this story, which was&#xD;
just suited to their calibre, a strange change came over thair com-&#xD;
panions face. His eyes, usually so calm and penetrating, gave a&#xD;
sudden flash. a spasm contracted his mouth, and his lips grew white.&#xD;
It passed away, leaving him a little paler and sterner than before.&#xD;
but his ey.s remained tixed upin a young girl who had nteretd th&#xD;
room on the arm of a gentleman, and was standing with her back&#xD;
towards them.&#xD;
First Beau. " Mis Campbell is lovely !I must remind her of my&#xD;
waltz. There, she is taking out her taIletsI'&#xD;
Second I4hv.  Putting up his eye-glass.  " Where is :he ? I&#xD;

First Beau.  " Just in front 1f u, in white, with lilih' o4f the&#xD;

Barclay.  %Vlh unusual animation.  '" They are real. There is&#xD;

Are you willing to answer me a few question.? n.&#xD;
Minnie bowed her head, in token of aset.&#xD;
Are you engfed to Mr. Stone ?''&#xD;
"Mr. Stone again!IThis is- insulting!" and she rose up angrily,&#xD;
intending to leave the room.,&#xD;
-But Edward laid his hand upon her arm, looked her steadily in&#xD;
the face, and said in his sternest tone, " I have suffered too much to&#xD;
be put off now. Sit down and answer my questions. Ten, minutes&#xD;
isal I ask :You need only say yes, or no."&#xD;
Poor Minnie looked arouse her, but there seemed no escape. The&#xD;
drawing-room door was shut, and before her stood  pitiless man,&#xD;
with his calm face, and resolute look. So sinking down in a chair,&#xD;
she turned away her head, and answered "No."&#xD;
Do you love Mr. Stone'&#xD;
"No."&#xD;
"Have you ever loved him?'&#xD;
No, though you were so kind as to recommend him to me as a&#xD;
husband."&#xD;
"IHush, child: those sweet lips were never made.for ironv. This&#xD;
is very strange."  And the Chaplain paced the room with a rapid&#xD;
step. Coming back to his old place, he said,'" One question more,&#xD;
and I have done. Turn your face towards me."  Mechanically she&#xD;
obeyed.   Tell me why you did not answer my last letter. Because&#xD;
afer afund ou had      enYour own feelings, you did not love me&#xD;
A burning blush covered Minnie's face; she started up in desper-&#xD;
ation.&#xD;
': You shall not torture me any more: you are cruel and ungener-&#xD;
ou s, as well as fickle. Stand aside. I will go.,&#xD;
"4As far as my arms, Minnie, and from them to the altar.  There&#xD;
is something I cannot understand in all this.  But you do love me,&#xD;
vou cannot deny it: you have loI me all this time."  And Mr.&#xD;
Talbot pressed her to his heart with a passionate longing, which&#xD;
struggled against, and unsatis6ed. would take no denial now.&#xD;
The sulden change. from indignation to joy. was too much or&#xD;
Minnie: her color fad away, she utteredta wild cry, threw one arm&#xD;
round his neck, and sobbed upc-)n his breast.&#xD;
I am cruel t.) you, my darling. First, I make you suffer from my&#xD;
bitterness. anl then from my rapture:" and he puthel back the&#xD;
heavy folds of her soft brown hair, and kissed her soAfl br'awn eves,&#xD;
then drew her gently to the sofa, anti seated himself l'v her side'&#xD;
Silently he wated her. until the serene expression came back upon&#xD;
her face, - the serenity of a cloudless heaven, as it always seemed&#xD;
to Edward. - Now tell me&#xD;
Not a word nmore." (ana she held up her fingr reprovingly).&#xD;
"Yaau seem ta think I ami made t4- answer questions.  I am t4-o&#xD;
tired and happy to talk any more :" and she laid her head on his&#xD;
shoulder.&#xD;
But there could be no rest for her lover's eager, penetrating&#xD;
spirit, until it had found out the whole truth. Changing his tone&#xD;
to one of entreaty he said, "I know Iwear you, but have ptec&#xD;

had allowed a child to twine about. his heart-trings, and grow up&#xD;
there. When he believed her faithless, he bamihed her from his&#xD;
thoughts, and would have torn her from his heart, but he could&#xD;
not : with every fresh struggle, he only uprooted the softer and&#xD;
gentler parts of his nature. I ask you to restore me to myself,&#xD;
drive away my jealous doubts. give me back my peace, by telling&#xD;
me why you left my last letter unanswered."&#xD;
Minnie raised her head, and said very gently, "If you really&#xD;
love me so much, I will do exactly what you please. Your last&#xD;
letter was about your brother's death.  I answered it the same&#xD;
evening.  A foolish answer I dare say -all blotted   with my&#xD;

CONCLUSION.&#xD;
Tan years have passed away. and the great Rebellion has been&#xD;
completely crushed. In its death-struggle it had assassinated the&#xD;
Chief Magistrate of the Republic, and attempted the life of the&#xD;
Secretary  f : State.&#xD;
A thrill of horror and indication at the foul plot spread through&#xD;
the land, and vet no anarchy or disorder resulted from it. such as thlt&#xD;
conspirators h.d hoped for. Calmly. Jihison assumed the reins of&#xD;

The boy's lip quivered, but he was a manly little fellow, and would&#xD;
have gulped down his disappointment, while his mother's tact pro-&#xD;
vided him with some other amusement, if it had not been for that in-&#xD;
corrigible father of his. Back he lolled in the bay window, laughing&#xD;
heartily, and calling out, "Come on, darling; break up everything in&#xD;
the house ; here 's a window to begin -&#xD;
This was too much for the bv's fseftrol : his sensitive feelings&#xD;
detected-the irony in his father's inifon, and his little molath be-&#xD;
gan to work, and his eyes to till with tears, when Ella caught him n&#xD;
her arms, kissed the tears from his eyes, while she won back his&#xD;
smiles by her playful caresses, scolding her husband all the time.&#xD;
"How unkind you are, Ilorace, to treat baby so. Kiss me again,&#xD;
little one. Here 's mamma's watch-chain, with all tie pretty charms&#xD;
upon it. If you lost your eigar and mouth-piece out of the window,&#xD;
the playthincrs of- your nper age, would you like baby and I to&#xD;
laugh at you   It's a perfect shame in its father to tease this dar-&#xD;
ling baby so! Hoddie, tell mamma what the lion says, and you shall&#xD;
go to the menagerie again with Debby, this afternoon.&#xD;
During this scolding and soothing process, Hlorace became quite&#xD;
subdued; indeed. he now felt himself to be the naughty boy, and be-&#xD;
gan to wonder what steps he must take to restore himself to favor.&#xD;
But woman's tenderness and forgiveness are unfathomable. Pres-&#xD;
ently Ella came and leaned her head against the bosom of the&#xD;
artist's blouse, and laid her little boy's beside it, while the wearer&#xD;
thereof encircled both with a pair of manly arms.&#xD;
So you see the curtain falls on I touching family picture. And,&#xD;
although Horace II. seems in a fair way to become what the world&#xD;
calls *pl4, yet we will comfort ourselves with the thought that he&#xD;
will have knocking about enough, in that same world, to make up for&#xD;
a good deal of home petting.&#xD;
