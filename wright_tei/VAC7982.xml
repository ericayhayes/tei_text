WILDENHEIM CASTLE, AND TIlE MURDERED&#xD;
NUN.&#xD;
A GERMAN TALE.&#xD;
I&#xD;
THE Marquis d'Axala, after leaving the Universi&#xD;
ty of Salamanca, set out immediately on his travels.&#xD;
lie was liberally supplied with money and letters of&#xD;
introduction by his father, who insisted. on his con-&#xD;
cealing his rank, and travelling as a private gentle-&#xD;
man. Before he entered upon his tour, the prudent&#xD;
.   parent addressed his son in a long'speech upon the&#xD;
principles which ought to direct his conduct, and the&#xD;
reasons why he had enjoined him for a time to drop&#xD;
his title; which were, that he might appreciate the&#xD;
j    estimation in which he himself would be held by the&#xD;
world when theirjudgment was not biased by his&#xD;
rank, and that he might examine the customs and&#xD;
I                                                               manners of the multitude, without derogating from&#xD;
his exalted birth. The Marquis saw the propriety&#xD;
I&#xD;
of this advice, and quitted Spain, calling himself by&#xD;
the plain title of Don Ahnagro di Cordova. Paris&#xD;
was the first station he made, attended ~y a faithful&#xD;
servant. Here he found the manners of the people&#xD;
trifling, unstabb~, and insincere; and, dissatisfied,&#xD;
bent his way towards the German Courts, intending&#xD;
to make some stay at ~trasbourg. The Marquis&#xD;
arrived safely at Luneville, and on stepping out of&#xD;
his chaise to alight at the inn, observed a rich equ~-.&#xD;
page at the door, and soon after saw an elegant fe-&#xD;
male, followed by two attendants, enter the carriage,&#xD;
which drove off immediately. He directly enquirer&#xD;

THE MURDERED NUN.&#xD;
&#xD;
~iXuvELLOUS REPOSITORY.&#xD;
was a German Baroness of great rank and fortune,&#xD;
who had been on a visit to the DutChCSS of Belle-&#xD;
cour, and was, returning to Strasbourg, to her hus-&#xD;
band, previoUslY to their return home. Almagro&#xD;
set off, and intended to reach 5~~~sbourgthat night.&#xD;
In this~ however, he was prevented by the breaking&#xD;
down of the chaise in the middle of a dark forest.'&#xD;
There seemed no alternative but for Almagro to&#xD;
take the servant's horse, and ride on; but the old&#xD;
postillion~ after stating the intricacy of the way in&#xD;
such a gloomy night, said it was only five ~iinute5&#xD;
walk from the cottage of Dubois, a very honest&#xD;
friend of his, and a wood cutter. The proffered&#xD;
help was immediately accepted, and the shattered&#xD;
vehicle was, with much labour, drawn to the cot-&#xD;
t'age, through the window of which they beheld&#xD;
the blaze of a comfortable fire: They soon made&#xD;
the cottage awake, who apologized for not opening&#xD;
the door till he had heard the voice of his friend&#xD;
Jacques, as there were a sad number of rogues about.&#xD;
He then introduced Almagro into another room,&#xD;
where sat a female whom he supposed to be the&#xD;
wife of' his host, who received hi.m with a slight re-&#xD;
verence, but did not rise to assist in providing for&#xD;
his accommodation till reproved by her husband and&#xD;
.Jacques.A chudish gloom overspread her counte-&#xD;
nance, and, though she might be called handsome,&#xD;
her very look and action expressed discontent.&#xD;
The woodman seemed to be about sixty years of age,&#xD;
and appeared to have absorbed all the fatness and&#xD;
fresh colour of his wife, who was haggered, though&#xD;
not yet thirty.&#xD;
The postillion would have proceeded to Stras-&#xD;
hourg that night for workmen to return and mend&#xD;
-the chaise, but Almagro over-ruled this, as the&#xD;
night was bitterly cold, and his arrival diere at a&#xD;
particUlar hour was of no conseque~1ce.~Not long&#xD;
after, Dubois put his head out of the cottage door,&#xD;
and said, "I wonder what detains my boys so long.&#xD;
o MonsieUr, they are such fine young men, that&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
4'&#xD;
&#xD;
you will say. when you see them, their equals are&#xD;
not to be fdund any where."&#xD;
"Such sons, indeed!" exclaimed Antoinette,"&#xD;
in a growling accent. "Come, come, Antoinette,"&#xD;
said the host, "cheer up a little; if your two sons&#xD;
are not quite asold I hope you will yet live to see&#xD;
them just such lads' as Martin and Philip. "Hea-&#xD;
ven forbid !" cried Antoinette, clasping her hands&#xD;
together: "I would rather see them perish first !"&#xD;
She then quitted the room, and the Marquis could&#xD;
not help remarking to his host how ill-fated he&#xD;
was n being united to such a woman. The man~&#xD;
briefly informed him, that her affection for two&#xD;
sons she had by a former husband made her play&#xD;
the step-mother with his two sons; but, cross as&#xD;
she was, she managed his family excellently. This&#xD;
discourse was interrupted by a loud halloo, fol-&#xD;
lowed by a carriage, attended by several cavaliers,&#xD;
who were proceeding to Strasbourg, but through&#xD;
the ignorance of the drivers had lost their way.&#xD;
A lady inside appeared to be princip~llv distressed,&#xD;
and whom Almagro recognized to be the lady he&#xD;
had seen at Luneville, the Baroness Wildenheim.&#xD;
The woodman showed evident chagrin at the arri-&#xD;
val of these strangers, but his countenance after-&#xD;
wards cleared up, upon learning the quality of his&#xD;
guest, and he soon arranged matters for the Baron&#xD;
ess to have one chamber, and Almagro the other.&#xD;
The servants were to be well accommodated in a&#xD;
large barn, a few yards distant from the house.&#xD;
This arrangement being gratefully accepted, Diibois&#xD;
was just going to conduct the male domestics to&#xD;
tl~eir outhouse, when Martin and Philip appeared,&#xD;
who Started at coming in, but, beiiig assured by&#xD;
Dubois that the good company would find a corner&#xD;
for them, they staid, and were presented to the&#xD;
Baioness an(l Almagro, after which the two wait-&#xD;
ing women were conducted by Antoinette to their&#xD;
lady's apartment.&#xD;
The two young men were tall and stout, aa&#xD;

acknowledged .Jacques as an old acquaintance.-~-&#xD;
They then drew a cutlass and a brace of pistols&#xD;
from under their clothes, and ~id them on a shelf,&#xD;
remarking at the same time 'Icy had just com.e&#xD;
from Strasbourg, and it was necessary to be well&#xD;
armed, as the forest was much infested with rob..&#xD;
bers. The Baroness earnestly wished to convey&#xD;
a letter to her husband, but the account of the fb~&#xD;
rest rendered it too hazardous to send any servant.&#xD;
When Jacques understood this, he informed her&#xD;
he was under the necessity of reaching Strasbourg&#xD;
that night, and would convey a letter safely, as he&#xD;
was too insignificant an object to be interrupted by&#xD;
banditti. The Baroness accepted his offer, and at&#xD;
the same time she gave her letter, the Marquis sent&#xD;
a few lines to his banker. The lady, finding her-&#xD;
self much fatigued, was conducted to her chamber;&#xD;
and on Antoinette's return, the Marquis, perceiv'-&#xD;
ing he was in her way, said he would go to his&#xD;
room till supper was ready.-Phihip. asked what&#xD;
chamber it was, and Antoinette replied, the one&#xD;
with the green hangings; and having put clean&#xD;
sheets on the bed, if the gentleman chooses to&#xD;
lounge on it, she should not make it over again.&#xD;
Philip, having remarked that it was no novelty to&#xD;
see his mother out of humour, opened the door,&#xD;
and began to ascend the staircase. "You fool,&#xD;
to go without a light !" exclaimed Antoinette, and&#xD;
passed the Marquis to put the candle into Philip's&#xD;
hand; in returning she met the Marquis just going&#xD;
to ascend: no one was near at the moment, and she&#xD;
instantly took the Marquis' hand, pressed it, and&#xD;
whispered, "Look at the sheets!" Don Almagro&#xD;
was startled, but Philip's voice calling him, he as.-&#xD;
cended to his room, where an exc&amp;amp;.lent fire was&#xD;
lighted. No sooner was his conductor departed,&#xD;
than he turned down the coverture of the bed, and&#xD;
stood petrified at seeing the sheets crimsoned with&#xD;
blood. The circumstances which had taken place&#xD;
convinced the Marquis of the horror of his situa&#xD;

tion, which was further cons ~med by hearing son~e&#xD;
one pacing hastily backwards and forwards under&#xD;
his window, whon' e discovered to be Dubois,&#xD;
looking round wh anxiety as if he expected&#xD;
some one. Having extinguished his candle, and&#xD;
repaired to the window, he~ saw Dubois joined by&#xD;
the postillion, Jacques, whom he had supposed on&#xD;
his way to Strasbourg. -They entered into a deep&#xD;
conversation, the result of which was, tiAt, as the&#xD;
Marquis had above 2000 pistons in his cIi~aise, and&#xD;
the Baroness had also a casket of je~ls of im~&#xD;
mense value, Jacques should immediaterV set out&#xD;
for the cavern, where some confederate banditti&#xD;
would be waiting till eleven o'clock; he was then&#xD;
to conduct them by twelve to the cottage of Dii-&#xD;
bois, and if any resistance was made by the cava~&#xD;
hers, the latter were all to be poinarded. The&#xD;
feelings of the I~ta rquis at the prospect before him&#xD;
may be easily imagined; unarmed as he was, cou-&#xD;
rage could do but little against so many; however,&#xD;
to avoid suspicion, he re..highted his candle, and,&#xD;
on descending, found the table spread for six&#xD;
persons. The Baroness sat opposite the Marquis,&#xD;
who by a single glance informed Antoinette that&#xD;
he had taken her hint. He could not escape his&#xD;
confusion being seen by the young men, who en~&#xD;
quired the cause, which he attributed to fatigue.&#xD;
The Marquis then talked upon his visit to Germa.-&#xD;
ny, and received an invitation from the Baroness&#xD;
to pass some time at her castle; at which the bro.-&#xD;
thers cast a malignant smile, that seemed to say they&#xD;
might never reach there. During all the supper&#xD;
time the Marquis talked incoherently, his atten..&#xD;
tion being fixed on escaping from the cottage,&#xD;
and getting to the~barn, to alarm the domestics;&#xD;
but the circumspection of Philip and Martin pre-&#xD;
~Tented this, and his only hope lay in Jacques not&#xD;
finding the banditti, in which case the guests rnig~t&#xD;
escape unhurt.&#xD;
The host lamented the poorness of his fare, and&#xD;

&#xD;
he insultingly remarked, that, if his guests should&#xD;
be detained longer than they at present intended,&#xD;
he hoped to provide them with better entertain ~&#xD;
ment. Dubois, then observing, that it very rarely&#xD;
happened he had such noble company, said he&#xD;
would celebrate the accidents of the night, by un-&#xD;
corking a bottle of most excellent wine, made by&#xD;
his father, who was now in a better world! He&#xD;
gave his wife the key of the closet, which she re-&#xD;
ceived with a look of fear &amp;amp;nd distress. When she&#xD;
returned, the Marquis' eye caught her's, and she&#xD;
looked frowningly at the wine, and then expres-&#xD;
sively at him. In the mean while, the host had&#xD;
drawn the cork, and filled two goblets, one of which&#xD;
the lady, at the instance of Dubois, drank. The&#xD;
Marquis, by its look and smell, took it for chain-&#xD;
paigo, but seeing some grains of white powder float-&#xD;
ing on the top, he raised it to his lips, and seemed&#xD;
to have swallowed two or three mouthfuls of it,&#xD;
when, suddenly starting up, and declaring that&#xD;
this sort of wine always made him ill, he feigned&#xD;
to spit itout, and unperceived emptied the liquor&#xD;
into a ~'ace of water behind him. Martin and Du-&#xD;
bois looked distrustful; and Philip, in a side whis-&#xD;
per, said, he had drank sufficient. The Marquis&#xD;
anxiously watched the effect of the wine upon the&#xD;
Baroness, who sunk into a profound sleep, which he&#xD;
did not dare to notice, but continued the conversa-&#xD;
tion. The banditti now no longer seemed to pre-&#xD;
serve appearances, but whispered among them-&#xD;
selves, and his danger seemed proceeding fast to&#xD;
extremity. In this situation, he was relieved by&#xD;
Antoinette, who, placing herself behind the seats&#xD;
of her step-sons, closed her eyes, and reclined her&#xD;
head upon her shoulder, pointing to the Marquis.&#xD;
He understood the hint, and in a few minutes seem-&#xD;
ed overcome with slumber. Dubois ~0W congratu-&#xD;
lated his sons, that the Spaniard was gone to sleep,&#xD;
as he began to sNispect him, and asked his wife, if&#xD;
she had given the sleeping draught to the female&#xD;

attendants, who answered in the affirmative, when&#xD;
the trampling of horses announced the arrival of&#xD;
the troop, and Antoinette horrified the Marquis by&#xD;
an exclamation of, "Gracious heaven, then they&#xD;
must die !" " Let us in;" was vociferated outside&#xD;
the cottage. "Yes, yes!" cried Dubois, joyfully;&#xD;
"they are our friends; you lead them to the barn,&#xD;
and do the business there~ I will manage my gen~&#xD;
tieman here, and the women !" Martin would have&#xD;
shot the Marquis upon the spot, but Dubois bid him&#xD;
follow his brother, and assist the new comers, who&#xD;
had dismounted, and were silently moving towards&#xD;
the barn. Dubois then went to a small cupboard,&#xD;
and unlocked it. At this momentA ntoinette whisper-&#xD;
ed in the Marquis' ear, "Now!" an(l on opening&#xD;
his eyes, he saw Dubois standing with his back&#xD;
t.,  towards him, feeling the point of a dagger. Not&#xD;
a moment was to be lost. The Marquis, unarmed,&#xD;
sprang from his seat, and being possessed of a pow-&#xD;
erful arm, he grasped the villain by the throat with&#xD;
such violence, that he threw him on the floor breath-&#xD;
less, while Antoinette, taking advantage of un-&#xD;
~    his&#xD;
recovered state, wrested the dagger from his hand,&#xD;
and plunged it repeatedly into his heart.&#xD;
"Our only safety now lies in flight !" exclaimed&#xD;
Antoinette; "follow me! quick a~ lightning !" The&#xD;
Marquis seized the Baroness in his arms, and has-&#xD;
tened after Antoinette, who mounted one of the&#xD;
banditti's horses, while the Marquis did the same&#xD;
with his charge. As they galloped by the barn,&#xD;
they could distinguish the shrieks of the dying, and&#xD;
the Marquis, unable to relieve th~m, felt a pang too&#xD;
great for utterance. Their flight was perceived by&#xD;
Martin, who with a torch recognized the fugitives&#xD;
in passing, and ordered a pursuit. The Marquis&#xD;
and his guide were in view of the steeple of Stras-&#xD;
bourg, when the banditti were found to be gaining&#xD;
fast upon them. The horses were spurred to the&#xD;
imost, and at the moment when Antoinette had ex-&#xD;
irned, "We are lost!" a numerous band of cava-&#xD;

hers approached, of the foremost of whom sh~ most&#xD;
piteously implored protection from robbers. "It is&#xD;
she herself~" exclaimed a lad, jumping on the&#xD;
ground; "it is my mother! Stop, my Lord, they&#xD;
are safe."&#xD;
Antoinette now descended, and clasped the cava-&#xD;
lier in her arms. "Where is the Baroness Wilden-&#xD;
heim ?" inquired another stranger, (~2ier husband)&#xD;
and on beholding her in the arms of the Marquis,&#xD;
he ejaculated, "God be thanked, she has escaped&#xD;
uninjured !" The Marquis, having pointed out to&#xD;
the company the approach of the brigands, they&#xD;
hastened to meet them; but the latter, perceiving&#xD;
their danger, fled towards the wood. Immediately,&#xD;
upon their arrival at Strasbourg, the Baroness, on&#xD;
whom the effects of the opiate had not ceased to&#xD;
operate, was put to bed, and a~ physician adminis-&#xD;
tered medicine to counteract its effects.&#xD;
While the Marquis was relating the adventure~to&#xD;
the Baron, the pursuing party returned, with the&#xD;
complete subjugation of the banditti. Their first&#xD;
visit was to the barn, where they found two of the&#xD;
Baron's servatits alive, though much wounded; but&#xD;
the Marquis' faithful servant, Lopo, had perish-&#xD;
ed. The waiting women, being overlooked by the&#xD;
brigands, in their hurry, were found still sleeping,&#xD;
and with an infant about four years old, which prov-&#xD;
ed to be the child of Antoinette, were removed to&#xD;
the Marquis' residence. When the first burst of&#xD;
Antoinette's maternal affection was over, the Mar-&#xD;
quis ~ecpiested to know the cause of her being uni-&#xD;
ted to such a man as Dubois, she blushed, and pro-&#xD;
ceeded thus:&#xD;
"1 was born of respectable parents in Strasbo&#xD;
where my father still lives. Betrayed by a vill in,&#xD;
I quitted my father's house: I dearly loved my s4du-&#xD;
cer; and this baby and the youth who warned you&#xD;
of your lady's danger, were the offspring of our&#xD;
love. He cautiously concealed from me that he ever&#xD;
imbrued his hands in innocent blood, and it was not&#xD;

till after he had been killed in attacking an Englisi&#xD;
traveller, that I learned this horrid feature. When&#xD;
my grief had subsided, I resolved to return to Stras-&#xD;
bourg, with my two Iabes, and implore my father's&#xD;
forgiveness; but, think of the bitter disappointment&#xD;
I felt when the banditti informed me, that they suf-&#xD;
fered none of their body ever to depart, who were&#xD;
acquainted with their retreat, and that I must make&#xD;
choice of a husband. They decided this by lot, in&#xD;
spite of my remonstrances, and I became the proper-&#xD;
ty of the infamous Dubois. A robber, and one who&#xD;
had been a Priest formerly, said a burlesque ceremo-&#xD;
ny, and I and my children were delivered into the&#xD;
custody of my new husband, who proved the reverse&#xD;
of my first lover, and strove to bend my nature to an&#xD;
approbation of scenes of blood and slaughter. I&#xD;
should certainly have put an end to my existence,&#xD;
but 1 trembled for the virtue of my children.-The&#xD;
youngest was not, capable of receiving my instruc-&#xD;
tions, but the eldest showed how little he was calcu-&#xD;
lated for the sot~iety of villains, by his detestation of&#xD;
their proceedings. This was my situation, when&#xD;
the perfidy of Don Almagro's postillion conducted&#xD;
him to the cottage, and I resolved to risk every thing&#xD;
to save one so young and innocent. Dubois watch-&#xD;
ed me so closely, that my only hope lay in procuring&#xD;
succour from Strasbourg. My son, Louis, was then&#xD;
ill in bed, but I seized an opportunity to steal to his&#xD;
room; he directly entered into my plan, let himself&#xD;
down from the window, took Jacques' horse, and&#xD;
rode to Strasbourg, where he applied to a magistrate,&#xD;
and the news reaching the Baron, who knew his wife&#xD;
was travelling that road, they set off with an armed&#xD;
party, conducted by Louis; the fortunate 'issue of&#xD;
which you are all acquainted with."&#xD;
On the recovery of the Baroness, Almagro was&#xD;
persuaded to accompany the Baron to his castle in&#xD;
Bavaria, prior to which the interests of Antoinette&#xD;
were not forgotten at Strasbourg. The good old&#xD;
man relieved his repentant and only daughter, after&#xD;

an absence of fourteen years, with open arms, and&#xD;
persuaded her to remain with him; but no induce.&#xD;
ment could influence Louis to leave the Marquis,&#xD;
who requested to be taken into his service, arid with&#xD;
all' the innocent eloquence of a youth of thirteen ~&#xD;
set forth the little services he might render him.&#xD;
The Marquis then dubbed him his page, and, before&#xD;
leaving Strasbourg, faithfully promised to restore&#xD;
him to his mother within the year.&#xD;
The journey to Wildenheim Castle proved very&#xD;
j)leasant, and Almagro found in the Baron an unin-&#xD;
formed man, remarkably fond of hunting; and the&#xD;
Marquis being a tolerable good sportsman, his dex-&#xD;
terity soon fixed him in the Baron's friendship. At&#xD;
the castle of Wildenheim it was, that Almagro first&#xD;
saw'the lovely Claude, then scarcely sixteen, and&#xD;
blooming in every beauty and accomplishment.&#xD;
From the Baroness, Almagro learned that Claude&#xD;
was her niece, and sister of his friend Olphos; that&#xD;
'she herself was his country-woman, and sister to the&#xD;
Duke of Calvados; that Claude was the daughter of&#xD;
Don Farojez, her second brother, and that she had&#xD;
beeii devoted to the convent from her cradle, and&#xD;
would soon make her profession at Madrid, in con-&#xD;
sequence of a vow made by her mother in child-.&#xD;
birth. Her brother Olphos was never made ac-&#xD;
quainted with his mother's fatal vow, and all his let-&#xD;
ters to Claude ~were always opened and inspected,&#xD;
which was the case with her answers.&#xD;
Almagro, master of these cruel particulars, deter-&#xD;
mined to attempt the rescue of this lovely girl from&#xD;
such a fate. He spoke to her of his friendship with&#xD;
her brother, of his willingness to serve her, and soon&#xD;
received' a confession of esteem and love. The&#xD;
Marquis proposed her quitting the castle of Wilden-&#xD;
heim, but this she indignantly rejected, and advised&#xD;
in its place, that Almagro should endeavour to gain&#xD;
the consent of her austere aunt to the union; and&#xD;
next, that of the Baron; and then her hand should&#xD;
be his.-The Marquis set about this 4dan directly,&#xD;
12&#xD;
&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
~nd applied the chief battery of his attentions to the&#xD;
Baroness, who was now about forty years of age,&#xD;
and yet retained several traits of former beauty.&#xD;
Her passions were amo ~ous and violent, and her&#xD;
hatred was as inveterate. Don Almagro labored&#xD;
incessantly to please her, and succeeded but too&#xD;
ivell After reading to her one evening an affect-&#xD;
ing Spanish romance, "Do you think it possible,"&#xD;
said the Baroness, "for any man to feel a lOVe SO&#xD;
sincere as the hero of this tale?"-Almagro replied&#xD;
that his bosom could answer in the affirmative,&#xD;
were he permitted to name the object of his affec-&#xD;
tion.-" She has long been known to me," said Don-&#xD;
na Lemnosa, "and laments most sincerely the cruel&#xD;
bonds which separate her from you." "Then you&#xD;
have discovered my secret," exclaimed Almagro,&#xD;
taking her hand; "and now what may I hope?"-&#xD;
"For my consent!" replied the Baroness~-" Ab!&#xD;
Don Alrnagro, I no longer can stifle the violence of&#xD;
my passion; I own I adore you! Respect for myself,&#xD;
and regard for the Baron's honour, are all vanquish..&#xD;
ed; they all bend to my love for you!" Almagro&#xD;
was silent-he stood astonished, contemplating the&#xD;
dreadful mistake to which his assiduities had led~.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the knowledge of her revengeful&#xD;
disposition, he resolved to clear up the mistake at&#xD;
the moment, concealing only the name of his mis~&#xD;
tress. This he did in the handsomest terms his&#xD;
eloquence could supply; but it abated nothing of the&#xD;
exclamatory fury which followed. She demanded&#xD;
who the happy rival was. "Let me," exclaimed&#xD;
she, "but find her who dares to rob me of your&#xD;
heart, and I will inflict upon her all the tortures of&#xD;
jealousy and disappointment.-Spies shall watch&#xD;
your steps and your~eyes, till she is discovered, and&#xD;
then tremble, Almagro, for her and your own&#xD;
Her rage here ending in a fainting fit, Almagro&#xD;
called her attendants to assist, and took the oppo1~-&#xD;
tunity to escape. Not knowing where he strayed&#xD;

to, he entered the garden, and saw Claude sitting&#xD;
at the window of a room that looked into it; some&#xD;
drawing instruments, and several large sketches&#xD;
lay before her. He entered the room, and be-&#xD;
fore be had determined whether she dare be trusted&#xD;
with her a~nt's vengeful determination, he was&#xD;
struck with the subject of one of the pictures. It&#xD;
represented the great hall of the Castle. In the&#xD;
front were several characters in caricature posi..&#xD;
tions, arising from terror at seeing a gigantic female&#xD;
figure, clothed in the habit of some religious order.&#xD;
Her face was veiled, and her dress was in several&#xD;
places stained with blood, which trickled from a&#xD;
gash in her neck. Onehand held a lamp, and the&#xD;
other a large dagger. Almagro asked Claude, if&#xD;
the picture was an invention of her own; but she&#xD;
replied, by asking him if he had lived three months&#xD;
in the castle of Wildenheim without having.heard&#xD;
of the bleeding Nun?-.Almagro rejoined, that he&#xD;
had never heard about the lady, and asked who she&#xD;
was. Claude replied, that she had been handed&#xD;
down in a traditional story from father to son; and&#xD;
that her aunt, as well as the Baron, firmly believed&#xD;
she haunted the castle. " But~ sit down," said&#xD;
Claude, "and I will tell you the whole of this alarm~&#xD;
ing story.&#xD;
"The Nun did not begin to be known. till after&#xD;
she was dead; but not choosing to remain for ever&#xD;
quiet, she fixed on this castle for her theatre of ac-&#xD;
tion, and being a person of taste, took the best&#xD;
room to, perform her ghostly pranks in. Sometimes&#xD;
she visited the other chambers and galleries, to the&#xD;
universal terror of the inhabitants, who described&#xD;
her as here traced on the paper. She soon made&#xD;
the castle scarcely habitable, and its lord was so&#xD;
frightened by these midnight revels, that one morn-&#xD;
ing he was found dead in his bed.&#xD;
"The next lord being a pious exemplary man, liv-&#xD;
ed in the castle~ and or some time after, no news&#xD;
was heard of her; but this lord died in five year~&#xD;
14&#xD;
&#xD;
and then she appeared again, somewhat more tracta-&#xD;
ble than before. She then walked about in silence,&#xD;
and never made her appearance but once in five&#xD;
years-a custom which the Baron firmly believes is&#xD;
continued. He is fully persuaded, that on the&#xD;
fourteenth of February of every fifth year, at mid-&#xD;
night, the door of the haunted chamber QpenS,&#xD;
which has been continued for a century. On this&#xD;
night she marches with a lamp and dagger, as in&#xD;
the picture, when the porter out of respect leaves&#xD;
the castle gate open for her ghostship, who, after&#xD;
an hour's absence, retires ~to her chamber, and is&#xD;
quiet for another five years. The sketch I have&#xD;
here taken is from the description of Dame Bar-&#xD;
jona, my governess, who tells that fifteen years&#xD;
ago she saw the spectre with her own eyes."-The&#xD;
caricature which the playful imagination of Claude&#xD;
had drawn from the Dame Barjona was so correct,&#xD;
that it excited both the laughter and admiration of&#xD;
the Marquis.,~ "If that please," said Claude, "I&#xD;
will present you with a likeness much more ridi-&#xD;
culous than Dame Barjon~i. Do with it as you&#xD;
think proper." She then unlocked a small cabi-&#xD;
net, and drew forth a miniature portrait of her-&#xD;
s~lf. Transported with gratitude, the Marquis&#xD;
threw himself at her feet, and was declaring to her&#xD;
well-pleased ears the ardour of his passion, when&#xD;
she suddenly uttered a loud shriek, disengaged her&#xD;
hand, and escaped from the room by a door that&#xD;
opened into the garden. On turning round, the&#xD;
Marquis beheld the Baroness standing near him,&#xD;
choking with rage. She had seen the portrait&#xD;
given, and h~ard their mutual declarations of&#xD;
everlasting attachment; the embarrassment of the&#xD;
Marquis and Donna Lemnosa was equal; but the&#xD;
lady first recovered the use of speech, and told&#xD;
him he should know what it was to love without&#xD;
hope, since Claude should be sent to Spain on the&#xD;
arrival of an .order from her parents, and there&#xD;
t~ke the veil. She then added that her niece&#xD;

should be confined till he took his departure,&#xD;
which she expected would he early as possible.&#xD;
The Baroness then darted from the room with&#xD;
,a look of contempt on the Marquis, who, after&#xD;
seeking the timid Baron, and vainly endeavouring&#xD;
to interest him in his cause, quitted the castle&#xD;
without a sight of Claude.' The Marquis was at-&#xD;
tended only by a French servant, and Louis,&#xD;
whose ability and disposition had endeared him to&#xD;
his master. "Courage, Signor,"~ said he, "I have&#xD;
watched the moment when Dame Barjona was ab-&#xD;
sent, to mount to the chamber over that of Donna&#xD;
Claude, and sung so loud that she heard me, and&#xD;
opened her window. I then let down a string,&#xD;
and drew it up in a few minutes, with this scrap&#xD;
of paper 'fastened to it." "When my aunt believes&#xD;
y&amp;amp;u have quitted Wildenheim, I shall be restored&#xD;
to liberty. Conceal yourself in some neighbour-&#xD;
ing village, till the night of the tl4rtieth, when I&#xD;
will be in the West Pavilion at twelve, and we&#xD;
will concert our future plans. Adieu. Claude."&#xD;
The Marquis obeyed the instructions of' Claude,&#xD;
and proceeded to Munich, leaving the care of the&#xD;
chaise to Fouet, his French servant; who was' or-&#xD;
dered to remain there till his master and Louis&#xD;
returned.-The latter, having disguised themselves,&#xD;
repaired to an inn at a village about four miles&#xD;
from Wildenheim, where a fortnight passed away,&#xD;
and Almagro had the pleasure of seeing Claude&#xD;
with her Duenna' pass through the village in&#xD;
good health and spirits, whither she came every&#xD;
Friday, to the convent there. Almagro attended&#xD;
the following Friday, and had the pleasure to see&#xD;
himself recogniZe(l by Claude in his disguise. At&#xD;
length the lon~-expected thirtieth night arrived,&#xD;
and the Marquis, with Louis, who had provided a&#xD;
ladder of ropes, scaled the garden wall, and posted&#xD;
themselves in the west pavilion. As the castle bell&#xD;
tolled twelve, the light footstep of Claude announc-&#xD;
ed her approach. The Marquis flew to receive&#xD;
16&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MURDERED NUN.&#xD;
&#xD;
her, and conducted her to a seat. "We have no&#xD;
time to lose," said Claude impatiently, "for Dame&#xD;
Barjona watches me every moment. In a week I&#xD;
am to depart for Madrid, to be sacrificed. I have&#xD;
no hope left but in your honour, and this is the plan&#xD;
of escape I have formed. On the fifth day from&#xD;
this time, the visionary nun is expected to appear,&#xD;
and by means of a friend I have provided a dress&#xD;
proper for the character. You must be ready with&#xD;
a carriage, at a little distance from the great gates&#xD;
of the castle; then, as soon as the clock strikes one,&#xD;
I shall quit my chamber habited as the ghost, and&#xD;
easily reach the. door; thus far success is certain&#xD;
but, if you reward my confidence with perfidy, th~&#xD;
world will not hold a more wretched being than&#xD;
your Claude." The plan was acceded to, and the&#xD;
lovers sat making mutual vows of love and honour.&#xD;
Suddenly the door of the pavilion was opened, and&#xD;
Barjona entered; she had watched her mistress out,&#xD;
and overheard the whole conversation.-" But 1&#xD;
shall mar all your projects," said the Duenna; "and&#xD;
as for you, Don Almagro, you ought to be ashamed&#xD;
of yourself, to seduce an innocent young creature&#xD;
away from her family.-Come, Claude, your ghost-&#xD;
ship will please to return with me." The Marquis&#xD;
interceded with the cruel Barjona; but, finding all&#xD;
remonstrance vain, after having premised her obsti-&#xD;
nacy would be her punishment, he took the veil of&#xD;
Claude, and enveloped Barjona's head in it, threat-&#xD;
ening her with instant death upon making the least&#xD;
noise; he then bound her hand and foot with hand-&#xD;
kerchiefs, and bid. Clmde regain her apartment, and&#xD;
carry her plan into effect on the day appointed.&#xD;
Claude then departed, and the antiquated intruder&#xD;
Was hoisted over the wall, and carried to the inn at&#xD;
the village, 'where Louis managed, by putting out&#xD;
the light, to get her conveyed by Almagro, without&#xD;
being perceived, into his room. The Marquis, when&#xD;
all the bustle was over, strove to reconcile Barjona&#xD;
to her temporary confinement, but such was the&#xD;

fury of the virago, that he was compelled to gag and&#xD;
lock her up, except at meal time, when he stood&#xD;
over her with a drawn sword. The greatest alarm&#xD;
was excited at the castle on account of the lost Du-&#xD;
enna; thus in various conjectures the five days pass~&#xD;
ed away, and in making preparations on the part 0!&#xD;
the Marquis, who had written to Fouet to be ready&#xD;
with a coach and four, on the 14th of February, at&#xD;
the village of Hauser. He was punctual. The&#xD;
Marquis and Louis repaired to the important scene&#xD;
of action. The coach was hidden in a large cavern,&#xD;
called W"ildenheim vault, close to the castle.-The&#xD;
night was still; the moon faintly shone, and the&#xD;
castle clock struck twelve, the usual signal for the&#xD;
family to retire to bed. Not long after, the porter&#xD;
opened wide the portal gates, the lights disappeared,&#xD;
and the whole fabric was eclipsed in darkness. The&#xD;
Marquis then ventured to draw near to the castle,&#xD;
and observed a few rays of light glimniering in the&#xD;
chamber of Claude. While he was going, a figure&#xD;
drew near the window and the curtain was care-&#xD;
fully closed to conceal the iamp burning there. At&#xD;
length, the solemn hour of one tolled, and in five&#xD;
minutes after, a light again appeared. The light&#xD;
soon faded away, and all was dark and gloomy.&#xD;
Not many minutes however, elapsed, when he saw&#xD;
Claude pass through the folding gates, habited ex~&#xD;
actly. like the spectre, with a lamp and dagger.&#xD;
She advanced to where Almagro stood; he flew to&#xD;
meet her, and clasped her in his arms. The terri-&#xD;
fied maid, overcome by joy, sunk upon his bosom,&#xD;
and in this state he conveyed her to the carriage.&#xD;
Louis remained behind to release Ba~rjona, and take&#xD;
a letter to the Baroness, explaining Almagro's rank&#xD;
and intentions to her niece.&#xD;
Being seated in the carriage, the p ostillions drove&#xD;
away with great fury; the horses became restive,&#xD;
and a dreadful storm of thunder and lightning corn.&#xD;
ing on, they were no longer manageable, but drag.&#xD;
ged the carriage at their pleasure till all farther pro.&#xD;

&#xD;
gress was stopped, by its striking against a tree~&#xD;
and being shattered to pieces. The shock threw the&#xD;
Marquis out, and wounded him so desperately on the&#xD;
temple ,that his senses forsook him, and he lay without&#xD;
animation till broad daylight, when he saw himself&#xD;
surrounded by several peasants, of whom he imme-&#xD;
diately demanded if they had seen Claude. They re.&#xD;
plied no person answering her description ha~d been&#xD;
seen by them, and they had been attracted to the spot&#xD;
by hearing the groans of the only surviving horse.&#xD;
Almagro immediately dispatched some of the pea-&#xD;
.  sants in search of Claude, while four that remained,&#xD;
made a litter of boughs, and conveyed him on it to&#xD;
Ratisbon; a surgeon being sent for, it was found&#xD;
that Almagro had dislocated his arm; broken a rib,&#xD;
and his left leg was dreadfully bruised. The arm&#xD;
however was set with success, and the surgeon an-&#xD;
nounced no other consequence from his hurts than&#xD;
a tedious and painful cure. It was conceived, both&#xD;
by the surgeon, the hostess, and the peasants, that he&#xD;
was delirious, when he talked about the lady he&#xD;
had brought with him since one o'clock that morn-&#xD;
ing from the village of Hansen, which lay at a dis-&#xD;
tance of many leagues from Ratisbon. All efforts&#xD;
to trace the lost Claude proved fruitless, and the&#xD;
furious agitation the Marquis had at first displayed,&#xD;
sunk into a milddespondency.-On the third night,&#xD;
as he lay tossing from side to side, and vainly en-&#xD;
dea~rouring to invite sleep, he heard slow and heavy&#xD;
steps ascending the staircase. A rushlight glimmer-&#xD;
ed on the hearth, and by an involuntary sensation,&#xD;
the Marquis raised himself up in his bed, and drew&#xD;
back the curtain. At that moment the clock of a&#xD;
neighboring church tolled one, the door was&#xD;
thrown open with violence, and the figure of the&#xD;
bleeding Nun entered, but without the lamp and dag-&#xD;
ger. His astonishment was changed into horror,&#xD;
when she lifted up her veil in a solemn manner, and&#xD;
instead of presenting the face of the beautiful Claude&#xD;
he saw before hun nothing but an animated corpse.&#xD;

The glaring eyeballs of the visionary female now&#xD;
fixed upon the Marquis, and in a sepulchral voice&#xD;
she repeated the first effusions of affection which he&#xD;
had uttered on her' escape from the castle. The ap-&#xD;
p arition then seated herself opposite to him, with&#xD;
her eyes fixed on his, till the clock struck two, when&#xD;
she arQse and approached the bed: then taking hold&#xD;
of his hand with her bony fingers, and pressing her&#xD;
icy lips to his, she repeated her former words, and&#xD;
quitted the chamber. The Marquis with a loud&#xD;
groan fainted: the sound was heard by the host and&#xD;
his wife, who entered his chamber~, and found some&#xD;
difficulty in restoring him to his senses. The fob&#xD;
lowing night the Marquis had a servanji' to sit up&#xD;
with him, and by the assistance of opiates had slept&#xD;
several hours till the neighboring clock struck one,&#xD;
when he awoke, and felt the terror of the preceding&#xD;
night renewed. His servant was fast asleep, beyond&#xD;
his strength to wake him, and the bleeding Nun en-&#xD;
tered the 'room with the same appearance as the&#xD;
preceding evening, saying, "Signor, Signor, thou'&#xD;
art mine! Signor, Signor, I am thine !" in a hollow&#xD;
voice, and after again pressing his lips, and staying&#xD;
till the clock struck two, disappeared.-This was&#xD;
repeated every night, and so little did his terror&#xD;
abate by familiarity to his nocturnal visitor, tha~t se-&#xD;
veral months elapsed before he was able to cross the&#xD;
room without assistance. The ghost was invisible&#xD;
to every eye but his, and whenever any attendants&#xD;
sat up with him, they were seized with an irresist-&#xD;
able slumber from the entrance of the spectre till&#xD;
its departure.&#xD;
Louis, who had, during this interval, been con~&#xD;
fined at Wildenheim, had some difficulty to find his&#xD;
master at Ratisbon, and from him and the subse-&#xD;
quent relation of Claude, he learned the following&#xD;
particulars. On the fatal night when her elope-&#xD;
ment was to havc taken place, accident had prevent-&#xD;
ed her from quitting her chamber at the exact time;&#xD;
nevertheless, she found no obstruction in getting&#xD;
20&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MURDERED NUN.&#xD;
through the castle gate, in her ghostly attire. Find-&#xD;
ing that Almagro was not there, she staid till past&#xD;
two o'clock, in traversing the avenues of the castle.&#xD;
When she returned, the door was shut~ but on&#xD;
knocking, the porter admitted the supposed spirit,&#xD;
and Claude passed quietly to her chamber. In the&#xD;
mean time, Louis, seeing the carriage drive off with&#xD;
the false Claude, returned to the village, released&#xD;
Barjona, and accompanied her to the castle. He&#xD;
found the Baron and Baroness disputing upon the&#xD;
porter's relation; but the mystery was soon deVelop-&#xD;
ed, on his being interrogated, and the ghost that&#xD;
appeared at past two o'clock was resolved into the&#xD;
person of Claude. The Baroness now artfully sup-&#xD;
pi'esse(l the letter, and the real rank of the Marquis,&#xD;
who, from a vanity of'being beloved only for his own&#xD;
sake, had not even revealed to his mistress that he&#xD;
was any other than plain Don Almagro di Cordova.&#xD;
This artful lady instructed Barjona to tell Claude,&#xD;
that the scheme had failed entirely through the per-&#xD;
fidy of her fortune-hunting lover; and Louis, lest&#xD;
he should contradict it, was kept confined in the cas-&#xD;
tle. Incensed at Almagro's perfidy, Claude passed&#xD;
another month before she consented to receive the&#xD;
"eil, and then set off for Spain with Don Faroj ez.&#xD;
Louis was set at liberty, and, after finding his mas-&#xD;
ter had not been at Munich, succeeded in joining&#xD;
him at Ratisbon. One day, while Louis was looking&#xD;
through the window, and Almagro was lying on the&#xD;
sofa, he exclaimed        goes the great Magi-&#xD;
c1a~n, who is the most singular man in the world!&#xD;
Some suppose him an astrologer, from Arabia,&#xD;
others, Doctor Faustus, and others, the devil. lie&#xD;
told me, when I was seeking you out, that he had a&#xD;
message for you, Signor, and that he alone could dis.~&#xD;
Spate the bloody phantom !" Ahn~~gro bid him fly&#xD;
att~r the magician, and request his attendance. In&#xD;
a few minutes he returne(l with the stranger, who&#xD;
was tall and majestic in his appearance. A band of&#xD;
black velvet encircled his forehead, an(l his wild&#xD;

black locks gave force to the secret awe his county~&#xD;
nan~e inspired. Having motioned to Louis to re*&#xD;
tire, he said, "Marquis, I have the power to release&#xD;
you from the nocturnal visitor. After Saturday,&#xD;
you shall see her no more! She is perpetually by&#xD;
your side, though visible to you only one hour in ~he&#xD;
day, nor will she ever leave you till her request is&#xD;
granted, which she will explain on Saturday night&#xD;
next !-Ask no more till then !"&#xD;
The Marquis then entered into conversation with&#xD;
him and found he had visited all countries. True&#xD;
to his appointed time, he entered the Marquis' room&#xD;
at midnight, with a small chest in his hand. After&#xD;
saluting him, he opened the chest, and took out a&#xD;
wooden crucifix, which he kneeled to, and kissed&#xD;
three times. He then produced a goblet, and&#xD;
sprinkled the floor with a liquid which appeared to&#xD;
be blood. The end of the crucifix was then dipped&#xD;
in the fluid, and he described a circle in the middle&#xD;
of the floor,, round about which were laid relicS,&#xD;
sculls, and other hiiman bones, in the form of cross~&#xD;
es. Having taken out a large book, he beckoned the&#xD;
Marquis to move into the circle, and be silent. He&#xD;
had scarcely commenced reading, when the spectre&#xD;
entered at the hour of one, and advanced to the cir~&#xD;
cle. After some unintelligible words on his part,&#xD;
he extended the crucifix towards the ghost, and in a&#xD;
solemn voice pronounced thrice the name "Malvo-&#xD;
glia!"----" Speak !" faltered out the spectre. "Say&#xD;
why," rejoined the sorcerer, "you haunt this&#xD;
youth? How can thy spirit be laid at rest?"~-" It&#xD;
is forbidden me to tell," replied the Nun; "fain&#xD;
would 1 repose in the grave, but my punishment is&#xD;
prolonged." " Look at this blood," rejoined the&#xD;
stranger, "knowest thou not in whose veins it flow~-&#xD;
ed! By his mates I charge thee to answer me&#xD;
The spectre shook her head in dissent.-" Now&#xD;
shalt thou obej me!" exclaimed the Magician, and&#xD;
he drew from his forehead the velvet band, and a&#xD;
burning cross was~?lsible on his brow. rrhe hor-&#xD;

ror the Marquis felt was equally imparted to the&#xD;
spectre, whose limbs trembled, while her quiver~&#xD;
ing lips spok~ thus. "At that mark I obey:&#xD;
learn then, that in Wildenheim vault, my bones rot&#xD;
in obscurity, and this youth only can consign them&#xD;
to the grave; his own lips have made over Ii is soul&#xD;
and body to me, and never shall he rest till my&#xD;
mouldering remains are at rest in his Andalusian&#xD;
castle. There let thirty masses be said for my repose,&#xD;
and then I disquiet the earth no more. Oh! that&#xD;
burning crucifix scorches me !"-The Sorcerer now&#xD;
let drop the crucifix, which till that moment he had&#xD;
pointed towards her, and the apparition bowed her&#xD;
head as she vanished into air.&#xD;
The exerciser then led Almagro from the circle,&#xD;
replaced his book, &amp;amp;c. in the chest, and addressed&#xD;
him thus: "Don Aim agro, fail not to fulfil those&#xD;
conditions punctually. Malvoglia is your relation,&#xD;
and, when living, bore the name of D'Axala. She&#xD;
was great aunt to your grandfather: She took the&#xD;
veil at an early age, but when her ungovernable&#xD;
passions began to expand, she contrived to elope&#xD;
from the convent, and fled to Germany with the&#xD;
Baron Wildenheim. Here she lived several months&#xD;
as his avowed concubine, professed herself an&#xD;
atheist, and disgusted the whole country by her&#xD;
grossness. Soon after her arrival, the Baron's&#xD;
youngest brother attracted her affection, and she~&#xD;
~bund in him her equal in turpitude. He made the&#xD;
return of his love the price of his brother's murder,&#xD;
and the night was fixed on for the deed. Rolan said&#xD;
that he would wait for her in Wildenheim vault, on&#xD;
the night of the murder, then with some friends pr&amp;amp;-&#xD;
ceed to make himself master of the castle, and con~&#xD;
elude by marrying her, which the Baron had ever.&#xD;
refused to do.&#xD;
On the fatal night, Malvoglia plunged her dag..&#xD;
ger into the heart of her lord, as the castle clock&#xD;
tolled one, and then quittino her bed hastily, took.&#xD;
the lamp in one hand, with t~ie bloody dagger in the&#xD;

other, and repaired towards the cavern. She reach-.&#xD;
ed Wildenheim vault unopposed, where she saw&#xD;
Rolan waiting for her. He listened to the narra-&#xD;
tive of the atrocious deed with transport, and before&#xD;
she could half enquirer why he* had brought no at-&#xD;
tend ants with him, or defend herself, he wrested the&#xD;
dagger from her, and plunged it, still reeking with&#xD;
his brother's blood, into her bosom, and terminated&#xD;
her life by repeated blows. Rolan now succeeded to&#xD;
the barony, and the murder was solely attributed to&#xD;
the fugitive nun. But his crime did not remain un-&#xD;
punished; her bones lying still unburied in the&#xD;
cave, the spirit of Malvoglia continued to inhabit the&#xD;
castle, dressed in her nun's habit, and holding the&#xD;
lamp and dagger. Every night she stood thus be-&#xD;
fore the bed of Rolan, utteriDg alternate prayers&#xD;
and blasphemies. At length Rolan's life became&#xD;
insupportable, and he was one morning found dead&#xD;
in his bed.&#xD;
"The castle next fell to a distant relation, who,&#xD;
terrified by the accounts of the bleeding nun, called&#xD;
in a holy man, who forced the spectre to silence dur-&#xD;
ing his life-time.---At his death, ~which happened&#xD;
five years after, she again appeared, but only once&#xD;
within every fifth year, at the same hour she mur-&#xD;
dered her sleeping lover; she then visited the cavern&#xD;
holding her mouldering skeleton, and returned at&#xD;
two o'clock, when she disappeared for five years.-&#xD;
She was doomed to suffer during the space of a&#xD;
century, which being past, nothing now remains&#xD;
kut to obey the injunctions of the spectre.-I now&#xD;
feel some consolation in having released you from&#xD;
her visits, and bid you farewell." The Marquis en-&#xD;
treateM the Magician to stay, and reveal some of the&#xD;
mystery attending himself, which the latter pro-&#xD;
mised to (10, if he would let him defer his. explana-&#xD;
tion to the next day, but on the following morning&#xD;
the Marquis learned that he had, quitted Ratisbon,&#xD;

Wandering' .Jew, he was never able to discover.&#xD;
Relieved of his terrors Almagro rapidly grew well,&#xD;
and soon set out for Wildenheim, where he was&#xD;
welcomed by the Baron and his lady, whose passion,&#xD;
the Marquis was sorry Ao see, was not diminished&#xD;
by his absence. Wishing to avoid the latter's re-&#xD;
venge, and l)erform the obsequies of the murdered&#xD;
nun, he collected her remains, and bent his course,&#xD;
with Fouet and Louis towards Spain.&#xD;
1-lie arrived at his father's castle in Andalusia,&#xD;
without any accident, deposited the bones of Mal-.&#xD;
i ogha in the family vault, and performed the masses.&#xD;
He now set about tracing Claude, but found that&#xD;
her mother was dead, that her brother Olphos was&#xD;
from home, and her father on a visit to the Duke of&#xD;
Calvados. Neither the ingenuity of himself', nor&#xD;
Louis, could develop the mystery, till the follow-&#xD;
mo- ad venture effected it. Returning home one&#xD;
ni~ht from the play house, he was attacked by three&#xD;
men in an unfrequented street. One he laid at his&#xD;
feet, but he would vainly have opposed the others,&#xD;
had not a cavalier with his servants heard the clash-&#xD;
ing of swords, and rushed to his assistance. The&#xD;
braioes then fled, and the Marquis, finding be was&#xD;
severely wounded, requested to be carrie dto the&#xD;
Hotel D'Axala.&#xD;
On mentioning the name, the Cavalier said he&#xD;
knew the father of the Marquis very well, and in-.&#xD;
sisted on his being taken to his brother's (the Duke&#xD;
of Calvados,) hard by.-When they had entered,&#xD;
the family Surgeon was sent for, and declared that&#xD;
the wounds were of no consequence, and only re-&#xD;
rest. "I esteem myself happy," said Don&#xD;
iFarojez di Calvados, "to render you any service, and&#xD;
am infinitely obliged to my daughter for detaining&#xD;
me so late at the convent of St. Clair. I am cer-&#xD;
tain my brother will lament his absence, but in the&#xD;
mean time every thing in the Hotel di Calvados is&#xD;
c~t your disposal." This was a double discovery&#xD;
for the Marquis, nor did he feel uneasy when he a1.&#xD;

terwards learned that Claude had taken the vows in&#xD;
St. Clair, as he flattered himself that his uncle's&#xD;
credit at the court of Rome could easily procure a&#xD;
bull to remove that obstacle. There was little&#xD;
doubt that the Marquis' intended assassination had&#xD;
been attempted by the means of Donna Lemnosa,&#xD;
yet he carefullyy guarded this knowledge from her&#xD;
brother Don Farojez, who had no suspicion that the&#xD;
Marquis was the person who had been attached to&#xD;
his daughter, under the name 'of Don Alrnagro di&#xD;
Cordova, at Wildenheim.-The Marquis now&#xD;
closely attacked the gardener of St. Clair with&#xD;
bribes and promises, and succeeded in persuading&#xD;
the old man to introduce him as his assistant. The&#xD;
Prioress suspected no deception, and for three days&#xD;
he worked in the garden, without meeting with the&#xD;
object of his disguise. On the fourth morning the&#xD;
Prioress and Claude advanced and seated them-&#xD;
selves on a bench; she was lecturing the fair re-&#xD;
cluse on her obstinacy in giving way to an ill requit-&#xD;
ed love,, when a young pensioner came, and called&#xD;
the old lady out. Claude then showed the charming&#xD;
girl several letters, which the latter read with plea-&#xD;
sure, and begging leave to copy them, retired to her&#xD;
cell.-The Marquis, now came forward, and Clau&amp;amp;e&#xD;
recognized him in his disguise. She accused him&#xD;
of falsehood, and would have retired; but he detain-&#xD;
ed her with an assurance that she had been deceived&#xD;
by the artifices of her relations. She listened, and&#xD;
the' next night at eleven o'clock, they agreed to&#xD;
meet again on the spot.-The weather was cold,&#xD;
but it secured them from ~n interruption, and the&#xD;
Marquis had a full opportunity of declaring the&#xD;
cause of his absence, on the fatal night of the spec-&#xD;
tre's deceiving him, and assured her, that even the&#xD;
dreadful barrier to their happiness of her having&#xD;
taken the veil, might be overcome, by the Cardinal&#xD;
Duke of Parma's influence at Rome. Claude list-&#xD;
ened, but combatted his arguments, stating her fa-&#xD;
ther's superstition would never pardon her leaving&#xD;
26&#xD;
&#xD;
the convent in any manner, and she concluded with&#xD;
saying, that she felt her voluntary vows to heaven&#xD;
were binding, and that her father's curse would fol-&#xD;
low her if she broke them.' The Marquis continu-&#xD;
ed to refute her scruples, till the convent bell rang,&#xD;
when he persuaded her to meet him at the same&#xD;
hour next evening.&#xD;
These meetings continued for several weeks un-&#xD;
interrupted, and in one unguarded moment the hon'-&#xD;
our of Claude was sacrificed to their mutual pas-&#xD;
sions.-When the bursts of dilirium was over,&#xD;
Claude started from the bank on which she was&#xD;
seated, and after venting the reproaches of con-&#xD;
science on the Marquis, she hurried to the convent&#xD;
in spite of his efforts to detain her. The next&#xD;
morning and night the Marquis attended at the gar-&#xD;
den, but Claude came not. Several nights passed&#xD;
away without seeing her, and at length the old gar-&#xD;
denet informed him, that the lady whom he used to&#xD;
the convent, to unfold the whole business to the&#xD;
meet had threatened, if 'he continued any longer in&#xD;
lady prioress, and that regard for his own safety, re-&#xD;
quired he should withdraw himself. Finding all&#xD;
efforts to see Claude were ineffectual, he submitted&#xD;
not to visit the Convent. In a fortnight after, he&#xD;
was summoned to attend his father, who was taken&#xD;
dangerously ill. He lay several months before he&#xD;
died, and a week more passed after his de~eease, be-&#xD;
fore the Marquis could arrange his affairs so as to&#xD;
return to Madrid. On his arrival, he found a letter&#xD;
from Claude, announcing that she was with child,&#xD;
and both the ini~ocent babe and herself would he&#xD;
lost if he could not extricate her from the tyranny of&#xD;
the vengeful prioress; that the gardener having~ been&#xD;
dismissed, and one of inflexible integrity in his~jdace,&#xD;
the only chance of her receiving an answer from&#xD;
him was by concealing it under the statue of St.&#xD;
Francis, in the Capuchin cathedral, whither she&#xD;
~vent to confess every Thursday morning. Her fa~&#xD;
their's death, she added, had removed one obstacle&#xD;

to their union, and she now entreated him to pro-&#xD;
cure with all speed the dispensation from her vows,&#xD;
as the only means of saving her life !-The Marquis&#xD;
felt pleasure at this epistle. because he thought he&#xD;
had the power to execute the prayer of it. From&#xD;
the first he had interested the ~Cardinal Duke of&#xD;
Parma, to procure the necessary bull, which he had&#xD;
just received a letter from him, he expected to ar-&#xD;
rive in a few days; but he also said it was necessary&#xD;
to get Claude out of the convent privately, lest the&#xD;
fury of the prioress should counteract his Holiness'&#xD;
mandate.&#xD;
The Marquis saw the necessity of This, and im-&#xD;
mediately had the new gardener seized, and convey-&#xD;
ed to his hoteL-Master of the key he entered, and&#xD;
depositedd at the shrine of St. Francis a letter for&#xD;
Claude to prepare for her elopement at twelve the&#xD;
next night. The Marquis in doing this became ac&#xD;
cidently known to the vigilant Olphos, his friend, the&#xD;
brother of Claude, who promised to assist, and in-&#xD;
formed him that he had r&amp;amp;jw nothing to fear from&#xD;
Donna Lemnosa, who in a fit of passion, had died by&#xD;
bursting a blood vessel. At twelve the following&#xD;
i~ight, the friends attended at the garden wall of the&#xD;
convent, with a coach and four. Don Almagro&#xD;
drew out his key, and they entered the garden, where&#xD;
they waited a long time, but Claude came not. The&#xD;
fact was, the prioress had learned the situation of&#xD;
Glaude, and the plan; she knew that to arrest the lov-&#xD;
er would only have provoked inquiry about the gov-&#xD;
ernment of her convent, and therefore she left them&#xD;
to wait as long as they thought proper, and then re-&#xD;
tire unmolested. The next morning Olphos repair'.&#xD;
ed to the convent, and requested to see his sister.&#xD;
He was informed by the Prioress that she had been&#xD;
taken ill, and confined to her bed the last three days,&#xD;
owing to something which secretly preyed on her mind3&#xD;
and which she would not reveal.&#xD;
Olphos requested to be admitted to her cell, but&#xD;
the prioress was shocked at such a horrid proposi-&#xD;
&#xD;
THF~ MURDF~RED NUN.&#xD;
tion, as admittinga man into the convent. Finding&#xD;
his sister was not to be Seen that day, hr. repaired&#xD;
early the next morning to the con vent and received&#xD;
an account that the Physician had ordered no one to&#xD;
see her. Regularly did he attend the convent every&#xD;
day, an(l received always a more unfavorable ac-&#xD;
count. Convinced that her indisposition was feign-&#xD;
ed, these accounts did not alarm him; but how to ex-&#xD;
tricafe her from the fangs of the Prioress was a very&#xD;
serious consideration, as she was cruel, superstitious,&#xD;
and never suffered a nun of rank to depart.&#xD;
F fortunately at this time arrived the pope's expect-&#xD;
ed bull for the release of Claude. The essential pa-&#xD;
per decided at once the proceedings of the Marquis&#xD;
and his friends. On the following day, Olphos was&#xD;
commissioned to present the instrument, and repaired&#xD;
to the convent early in the morning. When the&#xD;
maim service was over, he demanded to see the prior-&#xD;
e~s, who replied as usual, that the only chance of&#xD;
her dear child's recovery, was in keeping her from&#xD;
being agitated. To end tbe business, Giphos placed&#xD;
the Pope's bull in her hand she received it with hum-&#xD;
mility, but on perusing the contents, her hypocrisy&#xD;
forsook her, and in a rage she exclaimed,~."Th~&#xD;
Pope's mandate cannot be obeyed; it has arrived too&#xD;
late! I cannot deliver up Claude either with or with-&#xD;
out (IC lay, for she expired on Friday last !"- 01-&#xD;
phos started with horror, but recolleetin gthat the pri..&#xD;
oress had said the moment before that she was alive,&#xD;
he taxed her with falsehood, and insisted on her being&#xD;
Pi'oduced.-.~.."lf I concealed her death,'~ replied the&#xD;
Prioress, "it was only to soften the sad event to you.&#xD;
---AVhat interest have I in detaining one who has&#xD;
so long wished to quit our holy society? But her&#xD;
crimes are great, and it is not to be regretted such&#xD;
a wretch no longer exists. On Thursday last, in re-&#xD;

* followed it herself immediately! Claude is the'~e-&#xD;

by this crucifix she has been buried three days!"&#xD;
* -She then, with a scornful smile left the room, first&#xD;
observing, that he might now obtain a second bull&#xD;
from the Pope for her resurrection. Olphos also re-&#xD;
tired, and communicated the result to the Marquis,&#xD;
who was firmly convinced that the walls of St. Clair&#xD;
still ~~onfined her, and tried every means without&#xD;
success to procure intelligence of her. Olphos&#xD;
thought she was taken off by unfair means, arid two&#xD;
months elapsed without any thing arising to create&#xD;
a contrary supposition. All the researches of the&#xD;
Marquis d'Axala proved in vain, and the despair&#xD;
he felt brought on a long and severe illness. Olphos&#xD;
attended him constantly with the most fraternal af-&#xD;
fection; but no one was more sensibly afflicted than&#xD;
the amiable lad Louis, who left no means unemploy-&#xD;
ed to gain an entrance into the convent.&#xD;
Among other schemes he one day took it in his&#xD;
head to disguise himself as a beggar; he put a patch&#xD;
over his left eye, took his guitar in his hand, and&#xD;
posted himself at the gate of the convent, imagining&#xD;
that if Claude were at liberty, and heard his voice,&#xD;
she would recollect him, and find means to let him&#xD;
know it. His sweet songs soon attracted the notice&#xD;
of the nuns, and when the rest of the beggars were&#xD;
dispersed from the gate, he was desired to come in,&#xD;
and partake of their' charitable donation of soup&#xD;
The nuns all admired his youth and beauty, and&#xD;
agreed that he would be a worthy pillar of the Cath~&#xD;
olic church. rrhis was represented by the fortress&#xD;
to the Domina, who ordered him to be introduced.&#xD;
After havin~ asked him several questions, to which&#xD;
he replied a~'tlessly, the Prioress waS so please(l with&#xD;
him, that she ordered him to attend the next day, to&#xD;
~p eak further upon his entrance into the church.~-&#xD;
The Domina then retired, an&amp;amp;the nuns crowded&#xD;
round him, to whom he related his strange adven-&#xD;
tures, and amused them so highly, that each of them&#xD;
80&#xD;
&#xD;
gave him some little relic, waxen image, or conse,~.&#xD;
crated cross. H~ bad just remarked, that he should&#xD;
want a basket to put his presents into, when the&#xD;
mother St. Urbana presented him with one,4lined&#xD;
with satin, saying, significantly, that, thou gb it&#xD;
seemed of little value, it had many hidden virtues.&#xD;
Louis, in receiving the present, came as close to th ~&#xD;
grate as l)ossible, and she whispered in a low voice&#xD;
"Claude!"&#xD;
He immediately after withdrew, and hastened to&#xD;
the. Marquis, who started from his pitlow on hear&#xD;
ing what Louis had to say. With eager haste he&#xD;
ripped up the satin lining, and found the following&#xD;
note on a scrap of paper:-" I have recognized your&#xD;
page, and venture to send these few lines. Procure&#xD;
an order from the Cardinal Duke to seize my per-&#xD;
son an(l the Domina, and let it be executed at mid-&#xD;
night on Friday, during the festival of St. Clair.&#xD;
13e secret or I may perish before I can unfold the&#xD;
dreadful tale. St. Urbana."&#xD;
This note instead of giving comfort to the Mar-.&#xD;
quis deprived him of sense and motion. From the&#xD;
tenor of these lines he was convinced that Claude&#xD;
was no more; but when he recovered, both he and&#xD;
Olphos broke out into execrations against the assas-&#xD;
~in of Claude, and vowed to take a signal vengeance.&#xD;
~ A~i ii~ed till he relapsed into insensibi-&#xD;
flew to the p~ce of the Cardi-&#xD;
nal Duke who was out of town. Olphos set off im-&#xD;
mediately, as it wanted five days to the festival of St.&#xD;
Clair, and succeeded in obtaining the order for&#xD;
arrest, with which he arrived on the evening of the&#xD;
festival. Having shewn it to the Marquis, who re-&#xD;
rnaine(i very ill, he took it to Dow Gomez, an uncle&#xD;
of Claude's, and an officer of the inquisition, who&#xD;
Was l)ctrifle(l with horror at the recital of his nice's&#xD;
unhappy fate, and promised to accompany him at&#xD;
night with a band of trusty archers to prevent every&#xD;
Upposition on the part of the populace. They re-&#xD;

populace, and Olphos being recognized as a person&#xD;
of rank, was permitted with his party to place him--&#xD;
self opposite the great portal, through which the&#xD;
pilgrims were to pass. The convent service lasted&#xD;
till midnight, the finish of which was announced by&#xD;
a bell.&#xD;
The procession then began by the Capuchin&#xD;
n~nks haunting hymns in honour of St. Glair, and&#xD;
marching two and two; next came the novices with-.&#xD;
out tapers, and the professed with. ~To these suc-&#xD;
ceeded a beautiful young girl representing St. Lu-.&#xD;
cia her eyes covered with a velvet bandy and led by&#xD;
another nun. St. Catherine followed, and then St.&#xD;
Genevieve, surrounded by grotesque imps, who en-&#xD;
deavoured to abstract her attention from a devout&#xD;
book, on which her eyes were fixed; at this the&#xD;
sl)ectators laughed heartily. After a band of choris-&#xD;
tei's, came the reliques of St. Clair; the nun who&#xD;
bore the heart ~v4as the mother of St. Urbana, and&#xD;
Olphos recognized her by Louis' description. Next&#xD;
aI)peared the damsel representing St. Clair, select-&#xD;
ed from the most lovely ~f all the nuns. Her dress&#xD;
was inestimably rich, and she was seated on a mov..&#xD;
ing throne. Her beauty attracted every eye, and&#xD;
was contrasted With the sour visage of the Prioress,&#xD;
who followed at the head of the remaining nuns,&#xD;
with her eyes raised to heaven. The populace,&#xD;
blessed her as she passed, but what alarm and con-&#xD;
fusion followed, when Don Gomez arrested her in the&#xD;
name of his Holiness. When she recovered her first&#xD;
surprise, she called upon the people to protect her&#xD;
from sacrilege and impiety; they were eagerly pre-.&#xD;
aring to obey her, when 4Don Gomez rushed for-&#xD;
~ard with his band of archers, and threatened the&#xD;
populace with the vengeance oi the In(luisition: All&#xD;
was again quiet, and Don Gomez declared he must&#xD;
next arrest the Mother St. Urbana. At this 'no-&#xD;
inent Olphos stepped forward, and the prioress cx&#xD;

THE MURDERED NUN.&#xD;
&#xD;
claimed, "HQIy Virgin, I am betrayed !"-" Yes,"&#xD;
retorted St. Urbana, "betrayed by your villanies.&#xD;
I am your accuser-I charge you with murder, and&#xD;
stake my life for the issue of the a~c usatin."-A&#xD;
murmur ran through the multitude, and an explana-&#xD;
tion was vociferously demanded. The procession&#xD;
in thea mean time dispersed, and the mob ordered St.&#xD;
Urbana to harangue them from the vacant throne,&#xD;
which she ascended and addressed them as follows:&#xD;
"I am now at liberty to relate a tale, which had I&#xD;
been in the power of the prioress would have cost&#xD;
me my life, and numbered me with the once lovely&#xD;
and gentle Claude di Calvados. I was entrusted&#xD;
with her secrets, and she shared the love of every&#xD;
one-even of the p rou~d and forbidding prioress.&#xD;
Alas! Claude had Ii er faults, and who is free from&#xD;
error? She violated the rules of our 'order, and&#xD;
the sentence adjudged by the unforgiving Domina&#xD;
was cruel and inhuman, though conformable to the&#xD;
rigour of a law, altogether obsolete till she revived it.&#xD;
This law decreed that the offender should be plung-&#xD;
ed into a private dungeon, be there condemned to&#xD;
perpetual solitude, and her friends be induced to be-&#xD;
lieve she was dead. Here for the remnant of her&#xD;
life her food was to be bread and water, and the&#xD;
straw covered earth her bed.&#xD;
"A council of twelve elders was called to try the&#xD;
unfortunate Claude, and I was of the number. The&#xD;
superior reproached her in the bitterest terms, and&#xD;
commanded her to drink the contents of a goblet&#xD;
which she held in her hand, as an expiation of her&#xD;
crimes! the unhappy girl aware that the liquor was&#xD;
poison, sued for life in the most piteous accents&#xD;
and affecting prayers,-for a month, a week, a day&#xD;
longer !-The prioress bid her recommend herself&#xD;
to heaven's mercy, which had been insulted, and&#xD;
whose avenging instrument sh~ was. Claude drank&#xD;
it off, and the deed was soon accomplished. They&#xD;
embittered her pangs in dying by their reproaches,&#xD;
and such were her agonies, that they must amply&#xD;

have gratified the inhumanity of her enemies&#xD;
When the victim ceased to breathe, and the Domi-.&#xD;
na, with the assistant nuns, retired, I ventured out,&#xD;
and had scarcely strength sufficient to regain my&#xD;
own cell.- As I took the last farewell of the lovely&#xD;
lifeless body, I vowed to bring her assassins, to&#xD;
shame and death. No marks of violence appearing&#xD;
on the corpse, it was given out that she expired&#xD;
suddenly.-.&#xD;
" At her funeral, I unguardedly dropped some&#xD;
hints, and have ever since been so closely watched,&#xD;
that it was at the utmost hazard of my life I convey~-&#xD;
ed the secret to the -unhappy lady's relations. I&#xD;
have no more to say; for what 1 have already said, 1&#xD;
will answer with my life. I repeat that the prioress&#xD;
is a murderess: that she has driven from the world,&#xD;
perhaps from heaven, an unfortunate, whose offence&#xD;
was light and venial: that she has abused the power&#xD;
entrusted to her hands, and has- been a tyrant, a&#xD;
barbarian, and a hypocrite. I also accuse tije four&#xD;
nuns, Melhna, Porce la, Dolla, and Teresa as accom'&#xD;
prices."'&#xD;
Here St. Urbana ended her narrative. It created&#xD;
horror and surprise throughout; but when she re~&#xD;
lated the inhuman murder of Claude, the indignation&#xD;
of the mob was so audibly testified, that it was&#xD;
scarcely possible to hear the conclusion. This con-&#xD;
fusion increased with every moment. At length a&#xD;
multitude of voices exclaimed, that the prioress&#xD;
should be given up to their fury. To this Don Go'&#xD;
mez positively refused to consent. Even Olphos&#xD;
bade the people remember that she had undergone&#xD;
no trial, and advised them to leave her punishment&#xD;
to the Inquisition. All representations were fruit-&#xD;
less; the disturbances grew still ,more violent, and&#xD;
the populace more exasperated. In vain did Don&#xD;
Gomnez attempt to convey his prisoner out of the&#xD;
throng. Wherever he turned, a band of rioters&#xD;
barred his passage, and demanded her being deliver-&#xD;
ed over to them more .loudly than before. Giomez&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MURDERED NUN.&#xD;
&#xD;
ordered his attendants to cut their way through the&#xD;
multitude. Oppressed by numbers, it was impos-&#xD;
sible for them to draw their swords. He threaten-&#xD;
ed the mob with the vengeance of the Inquisition:&#xD;
but, in this moment of popular phrenzy, even this&#xD;
dreadful name had lost its effect. Though regret&#xD;
for his sister made him look upon the prioress with&#xD;
abhorrence, Olphos could not help pitying a woman&#xD;
in a situation so terrible: but in spite of all his ex-&#xD;
ertions, those of the Miarquis, Don Gomez, and&#xD;
the archers, the people continued to-press onwards.&#xD;
They forced a passage through the guards who pro-&#xD;
tected their destined victim, dragged her from her&#xD;
shelter, and proceeded to take upon her a most sum-&#xD;
mary and cruel vengeance. Wild with terror, and&#xD;
scarcely knowing what she said, the wretched wo-&#xD;
man shrieked for a inoment's mercy: she protested&#xD;
that she was innocent of the death of Claude, and&#xD;
could clear herself from the suspicion beyond the&#xD;
power of doubt. The rioters heeded nothing but&#xD;
the .gratification of their barbarous vengeance.&#xD;
They 'refused to listen to her: they shewed her&#xD;
every sort of insult, loaded her with mud and filth,&#xD;
and called her by the most approbrious appellations.&#xD;
They tore her one from another, and each new tor-&#xD;
mentor was more savage than the former. They&#xD;
stifled with howls and execrations, her shrill cries&#xD;
for mercy, and dragged her through the streets,&#xD;
Spurning her, and trampling her, and treating her&#xD;
with every species of cruelty, which hate or vindic-&#xD;
tive fury could invent. At length, a flint, aimed by&#xD;
some well directing hand, struck her full upon the&#xD;
temple. She sunk upon the ground, bathed in&#xD;
blood, and in a few minutes terminated her misera-&#xD;
Sble existence. Yet though she no longer felt their&#xD;
insults, the rioters still exercised their impotent rage&#xD;
upon her lifeless body. They beat it, trod upon -it,&#xD;
and ill used it, till it became no more than a mass o&#xD;
flesh, unsightly, shapeless, and disgusting.&#xD;

and his friends had beheld it with the utmost horror&#xD;
b~t they were roused from their compelled inac-&#xD;
tivity, on hearing that the mob were attacking the&#xD;
convent of St. Clair~ The incensed populace, con-&#xD;
founding the innocent with the guilty, had resolved&#xD;
to sacrifice all the nuns of that order to their rage,&#xD;
and not to leave one stone of the building upon an-&#xD;
other. Alarmed at this intelligence, they hastened&#xD;
to the convent, resolved to defend it if possible, or&#xD;
at least to rescue the inhabitants from the fury of the&#xD;
rioters. Most of the nuns had fled, but a few still&#xD;
remained in their habitation. Their situation was&#xD;
truly dangerous. However, as they had taken the&#xD;
l)recautiOn of fastening the inner gates, with this&#xD;
assistance, Olphos hoped to repel the mob, till Don&#xD;
Gomez should return to him with a more sufficient&#xD;
force.&#xD;
Having bee~i conducted by the former disturbance&#xD;
to the distance of some streets from the convent, he&#xD;
did not immediately reach it. When he arrived,&#xD;
the throng surrounding it was so excessive, as to&#xD;
prevent his approaching the .gates. In the interim,.&#xD;
the populace besieged the building with persever-&#xD;
ing rage: they battered the walls, threw lighted&#xD;
torches in at the windows, and sworethat by break&#xD;
of day not a nun of St. Clair~s order should be left&#xD;
alive. Olphos had just succeeded in piercing his&#xD;
way through the croud, when one of the gates was&#xD;
forced open. The rioters poured into the interior&#xD;
part of the building, where they exercised their&#xD;
vengeance upon every thing which found itself in&#xD;
their passage. ~rhey broke the furniture into&#xD;
~ jeces, tore down the pictures, destroyed the re-&#xD;
liques, and in their hatred of the servant, forgot&#xD;
all respect to the saints. Some employed them-&#xD;
selves in searching out the nuns, others again in set-&#xD;
ting fire to the pictures and other valuable furniture&#xD;
which it contained. These latter produced the&#xD;
most decisive desolation. Indeed the consequences&#xD;
of their action were more sudden than themselves&#xD;
26&#xD;

THE MURDERED NUN.&#xD;

I,&#xD;
&#xD;
had expected or wished. The flames rising from&#xD;
the burning piles caught part of the building, which,&#xD;
being old and dry, the conflagration spread with&#xD;
rapidity from room to room. The walJs were soon&#xD;
shaken by the devouring element. The columns&#xD;
gave way, the roofs came tumbling down upon the&#xD;
rioters, and crushed many of them beneath their&#xD;
weight. Nothing was to beheard but shrieks and&#xD;
groans. The convent was wrapt in flames, and.the&#xD;
whole presented a scene of devastation and horror.&#xD;
Giphos entered with the rabble, and vainly en-&#xD;
deavou red to repress their in discriminating fury, till&#xD;
the progress of the flames compelled him to seek&#xD;
for his own safety. The mob now hastened out with&#xD;
more eagerness than they had entered; the door&#xD;
ways were suddenly closed up, and the flames ra-&#xD;
~)i(lly advancing, many perished from this canse as&#xD;
ivell aspressure. Olphos, more fortunate, made his&#xD;
escape at a small door in a further aisle of the chapel,.&#xD;
which led him to the foot of St. Clair's sepulchre.&#xD;
Here he stQpped to breathe, and found he was fol-&#xD;
lowed l)y Gomez and some of his people. A wicket&#xD;
door in the wall opened into the garden of the Capu-&#xD;
chins, and they all passed through except Olphos,&#xD;
who being the last, observed the door of the sepulchre&#xD;
to be softly opened. Some one looked out, but on&#xD;
seeing a stranger, uttered a shriek, flew back and de-&#xD;
scended the marble steps. Giphos immediately l)ur-&#xD;
sued, and followed through dark and subterranean&#xD;
vaults, till he could only trace the object he was in&#xD;
quest of, by the sound of the feet. He at length be-&#xD;
came quite bewildered and with his sword drawn,&#xD;
grouped his way till he caught the ~limmcr of a lamp,&#xD;
which as he drew near, he perceived was placed be&#xD;
fore the statue of St. Clair.&#xD;
Several females stood round it, and, from their&#xD;
conversation, Giphos learned they had flown there&#xD;
for security from the mob. They were thrown into&#xD;
the most dreadful alarm when he presented himseW,&#xD;
~ut he soon dissipated their fears. While he wa~&#xD;

&#xD;
assuring them of protection, a loud groan seemed to&#xD;
issue from the middle of the vault in which he and&#xD;
the nuns were. A second groan followed, and the&#xD;
noise plainly came from the statue. The nuns ac-&#xD;
counted for the noise as a miraculous intimation from&#xD;
the saint that she was offended at the proceedings of&#xD;
the people, and showed Olphosahuman hand, grasp-&#xD;
in gh er arm, which had once belonged to a man who&#xD;
bad sacrilegiously mounted the statue of St. C lair to&#xD;
steal a valuable ring from her finger. Th6 robber&#xD;
could'be released only by amputation, since which&#xD;
he had tu~i~ied hermit, and no one had dared to touch&#xD;
the statue~ under the fear of certain destruction.&#xD;
This extraordinary legend led Olphos to examine&#xD;
the arm of St. Clair with particular attention; and&#xD;
jumping over the iron railing which enclosed her, lie&#xD;
ascended the pedestal, and discovered a small iron&#xD;
knob between the shoulder and the supposed man's&#xD;
hand; on pressing it, it seemed to loosen a chain that&#xD;
attached the wooden image to the base. Lifting this&#xD;
off, he perceived a heavy iron grate in the hollow&#xD;
of the pedestal, which, with some difTh~ulty, he rais.-&#xD;
ed, inviting the nuns to follow; this they declined,&#xD;
and he descended a flight of rude misshapen steps to&#xD;
a cavern and thought he perceived a spark of light:&#xD;
-as he wandered on, he lost sight of it, but a plain&#xD;
tive moan stole upon his ear, and he directed his steps&#xD;
towards it. It became more audible as he advanced,&#xD;
and at length conducted him to a narrow gloomy dun-&#xD;
geon in one side of the cavern.-.Thr6ugh the ~Ta-.&#xD;
poury and pestilential fog that clouded this cell, by&#xD;
the glimmering beams of a lamp, he saw a pale, ema-&#xD;
ciated human being, lying on a bed of straw. She&#xD;
was partly naked, her disordered hair concealed her&#xD;
face, and a tattered rag enveloped her limbs. With&#xD;
ene hand she pressed a small bundle to her bosom;&#xD;
the other hung inactively down. Her sunken eyes&#xD;
were directed to her crucifix, and beside her straw,&#xD;
was a basket and an earthen pitcher. Olphos stop-&#xD;
j~ed a moment to contemplate this horrid object: sIit~&#xD;
&#xD;
THE MURDF!RED NUN.&#xD;
&#xD;
cast her eyes towards the staircase, and then in a&#xD;
feeble voice uttered, "No one comes to me !-Two&#xD;
long days passed and no food !-Oh, cruel, to length-&#xD;
en out my miseries by a death of hunger !" She then&#xD;
shivered, drew the rug closer over her shoulders,&#xD;
and addressed the l)undle which lay on her breast.&#xD;
"Dear babe, once so lovely, so like him, how have a&#xD;
few days changed thee!-Yet still art thou dear to&#xD;
me, arid I will weep over thy putrid form !" She then&#xD;
shed some tears, which she wiped away with her&#xD;
tresses, and stretched out her hand to the pitcher,&#xD;
hot put it back again, exclaiming, "Not a drop!&#xD;
Oh! I would give worlds for a drop of' water to&#xD;
allay my burning thirst !~'&#xD;
Olphos, no longer able to contain his feelings,&#xD;
entered the dungeon, and in a soft voice, said he&#xD;
was come to relieve her woes. The captive start-.&#xD;
e(l, and eagerly demanded if the prioress had sent&#xD;
him to destroy her. Giphos related that he was&#xD;
come to give her liberty and comfort, and that she&#xD;
had nothing to fear from the prioress, who had been&#xD;
sacrificed to The popular indignation. As Olphos&#xD;
stooped to raise her, the beams of the lamp struck&#xD;
full upon his face, and the captive exclaimed," Is it&#xD;
l)ossible !-.Those features !---Ah! it is -" She&#xD;
said no more, but sunk upon the straw in a fainting&#xD;
fit. Giphos lost no time in removing an iron chain,&#xD;
which encircled the body of the unknown victim,&#xD;
and taking her in his arms, by the iron lamp, he&#xD;
gained the iron grate, where he met the nuns, who&#xD;
were waiting his return with the greatest anxiety.&#xD;
They busily employed themselves in restoring the&#xD;
inanimate female, till they were alarmed by the&#xD;
sound of Don Goinez's cries, calling on GIphos to&#xD;
know if he were safe.&#xD;
The beautiful Almira, who had personated St.&#xD;
Clair, requested not to be separated from the rescued&#xD;
jwisoner~ and Don Gomez conducted them both to her&#xD;
Here the unfortunate was immediately put&#xD;
to bed, and medical assistance procured. As her&#xD;

illness had principally arisen from her weakness&#xD;
and want of wholesome food, she very soon assumed&#xD;
an altered appearance; and when her history was&#xD;
related, she proved to be the supposed deceased and&#xD;
sacrificed Claude! -The account which Claude&#xD;
gave of her sufferi ..~s and imprisonment ran thus:&#xD;
"My imagined death was attended with the&#xD;
greatest agonies, and when I awoke from my trance,&#xD;
azi hour elapsed before I was sufficiently collected to&#xD;
examine the surrounding objects. I found myself&#xD;
extended upon a sort of wicker couch, with four&#xD;
handles, which doubtless served the nuns to convey&#xD;
me to my grave. A lamp was over my head, and&#xD;
four narrow walls encompassed me. Perceiving my&#xD;
grated door was unfastened, I rose to endeavour to&#xD;
explore my way out; but the first thing I put my&#xD;
hand on was the corrupted head of a nun, who had&#xD;
(lied some months before. This dreadful discovery&#xD;
proml)ted me the more eagerly to remove, and I as-&#xD;
a         ended through the grated door, and got jut oavault,&#xD;
which was strewed with sepulchral fragments and&#xD;
mouldering bones. I advanced eagerly to the door&#xD;
which formed the outlet, and to my horror found it&#xD;
fastened on the other side.&#xD;
I now abandoned myself to the prospect of per-&#xD;
i~hing with hunger, and projected destroying ray-&#xD;
a         self, hut the sake of the infant Ibore prevented me.&#xD;
Suddenly a neighboring tomb caught my eye, on&#xD;
which was a basket containing some coarse bread,&#xD;
and a small bottle of water. 1 blessed the friendly&#xD;
hand which had placed these viands there, and de~&#xD;
poured them with eagerness. I then sat down, de-&#xD;
hating on the cause of finding this relief, and was&#xD;
inexpressibly delighted with hearing the sound of&#xD;
footsteps approach, and seeing a light advance; but&#xD;
all my hopes~'ere dashed to pieces when I heard&#xD;
the door unbolted, and saw the prioress enter, with&#xD;
the four nuns, who had been. witnesses of my sup-&#xD;
posed death. She gazed upon me With angry eyes,&#xD;
and exclaimed, "Do I see a repentant or a criminal?&#xD;

TUE MURDERED NUN.&#xD;
&#xD;
-T fear those tears are shed less for your fault, than&#xD;
to excite my compassion.-But I do not wish for&#xD;
your death, but your repentance. I administered&#xD;
an opiate, not a poison, that you might feel the ago-.&#xD;
nies of a guilty conscience, without dying. I shall&#xD;
now purify you with wholesome correction, and re~&#xD;
vive the long neglected laws of our convent, for&#xD;
such incontinent crimes as yours. All Madrid&#xD;
thinks you dead; I have taken sufficient caution to&#xD;
continue the mystery, therefore abandon all thoughts&#xD;
of this world, and prepare for that which is soon to&#xD;
a   come. Now listen to die sentence of St. Clair.&#xD;
Beneath these vaults are dungeons allotted to such&#xD;
criminals as yourself. Thither are you to be con-&#xD;
veyed. Food and raiment, just sufficient to support&#xD;
nature in the coarsest manner, will be supplied you.&#xD;
There, chained down, and illuminated only by ~&#xD;
feeble lamp, you ~vill have leisure to repent. Fol-&#xD;
low me!" Thunderstruck at thi~ sentence, I faint-&#xD;
ed, and was conveye(l by two of the nuns to the&#xD;
principal shrine of St. Clair. The nuns then raise1(l&#xD;
an iron grate, hitherto concealed by the image,&#xD;
which was taken from the pedesta~ ~n~d w~ descend-&#xD;
ed. I was conducted down a frightful abyss, an(l&#xD;
forced into one of the cells that lined the walls of&#xD;
the cavern. I now interceded for mercy, for the&#xD;
sake of my unborn babe, but the prioress cursed my&#xD;
innocent offspring, and vowed that I should bring it&#xD;
into the world, feed,* ~and bury it, unbefriended!&#xD;
Her gross inhumanity threw me into a second fit,&#xD;
and when I recovered, my tyrant had departed. I&#xD;
then awoke to the horrors of my situation, but&#xD;
scantily supplied with clothing, food, and oil for my&#xD;
lamp. To add to my misery, the pains of child-&#xD;
birth came on, and I was delivered of my forlorn&#xD;
burihen. It came alive into the world, but soon&#xD;
perished from my ignorance, and a want of proper&#xD;
attendance. The bitter wind that whistled through&#xD;
the vaults, the misty damps that arose from the&#xD;
ground, in a fe1w hours finished its existence, and&#xD;

witnessed its death with agonies that even wound&#xD;
me severely n~ow.&#xD;
"Sister Theresa visited me every twenty-four&#xD;
hours, arid would fain have buried the infant, but&#xD;
the contemplation of its features was my only com-&#xD;
fort, and I would not have it separated from me;&#xD;
nor,-when I quitted my prison, could I scarcely be&#xD;
persuaded 'to entomb the precious remains. The&#xD;
reason of Theresa's not visiting me as usual, with&#xD;
my stipulated allowance, I have been since informed&#xD;
by the Mother Urbana; she was suddenly taken ill,&#xD;
and a dangerous infectious fever confined her to her&#xD;
bed, from which cause no one would attend her,&#xD;
but the lay sister who was appointed to nurse.&#xD;
The prioress, and the nuns in the mystery, had given&#xD;
me over entirely to her care. One day passed away&#xD;
without food; another, and a third arrived, but no&#xD;
Theresa, no sustenance! The lapse of time was&#xD;
discernable by the wasting of my lamp, to feed&#xD;
which, fortunately, oil enough for four days had&#xD;
been left me. In this dreadful dilemma, I thought&#xD;
the Doinina had ordered the nuns to let me perish.&#xD;
I was become an absolute skeleton; I had the pangs&#xD;
of hunger gnawing at my vitals, and groans were&#xD;
all I had strength to utter. I was looking for the&#xD;
moment of my dissolution, when my beloved brother&#xD;
arrived in time to save me. My dim sight at first&#xD;
could not recognize him, but when it did, the burst&#xD;
of rapture overpowered me, and my emotions found&#xD;
refuge in insensibility. 0 Glphos, d'Axala, how&#xD;
shall I repay the debt of gratitude I owe to your cx-&#xD;
ertion~, how compensate you for the affluence and&#xD;
ease I now feel, surrounded by those I esteem, and&#xD;
about to become the wife of him who has long l)e fore&#xD;
been wedded to my heart! d'Axala, think not, be-&#xD;
cause you once found me frail, that you will ~vi~ness&#xD;
such another error in my future conduct. No!--I&#xD;
am fully sensible of the great a rid grievous error I&#xD;
have committed, but 1 trust heaven has accepted&#xD;
the sufferings I have endured,' as an expiation of&#xD;
42&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
that crime.-Had it not been for the consequences&#xD;
of that unguarded moment, I had never seen you&#xD;
again: but, Fate has ordained it otherwise, and I&#xD;
rejoice in the wise dispens4ion of Providence!&#xD;
Here then shall the subject rest, and my future life&#xD;
convince d'Axala, that the error of his mistress shall&#xD;
operate to render her more exemplary as a wife."&#xD;
Here Claude ceased, and her friends replied to her&#xD;
address, in terms equally affectionate and encour-&#xD;
aging. It may easily be expected that Claude had,&#xD;
before commencing her narrative made inquiries&#xD;
co~lcerning Don Almagro.&#xD;
The wretched situation in which he lay, gave her&#xD;
a great shock, b~t as there did not appear any dan&#xD;
ger of not surviving his malady, she secretly exulted&#xD;
in the cause of his illness, since it proved the&#xD;
strength of his affection. Giphos undertook the&#xD;
pleasing duty of communicating to his friend the&#xD;
happiness that awaited him, in the liberation of&#xD;
Claude, and her ral)id convalescence. Notwith-&#xD;
standing the caution Olphos used in relating the in-&#xD;
tellige rice, Almagro's transports were so violent, as&#xD;
to threaten his life from an excess of joy. These&#xD;
once past, assured of the completion of his wishes,&#xD;
and above all, blest with the presence of Claude,&#xD;
who, immediately, when she had recovered under&#xD;
the care of Almira, hastened to attend her lover, and&#xD;
soon enabled him to overcome the effects of his late&#xD;
malady. The ease of his mind communicated itself&#xD;
to his body, an.d he recovered his health with asto-&#xD;
nishing rapidity. rrhe next time the happy party&#xD;
met, Giphos expressed his satisfaction at the pros~&#xD;
pect of being so intimately connected with a man,&#xD;
for whom he had so much esteem. No obstruction&#xD;
could now present itself, (the Pope's bull having&#xD;
liberated Claude from all monastic engagements)&#xD;
except the illness of Don Olphos-which now&#xD;
threatened to place him in the same situation his&#xD;
friend had just esca1)ed from.&#xD;

OF THE WORLD.&#xD;
THIs Colossus was dedicated to the sun, by The-&#xD;
agonis, Prince of the Island of Rhodes, and it is re-&#xD;
ported, that there never passes a day which gives&#xD;
not additional lustre by thze beams of that planet.&#xD;
Chares Lindius, the disciple of Lysippus, is said to&#xD;
have finished and erected this vast Colossus of brass,&#xD;
(the podigious height of which has given the name&#xD;
of Colossus to all other statues of excessive magni-&#xD;
tude,) about A. M. 3686, in the space of twelve&#xD;
years. It is holvever said that through a mistake&#xD;
in the calculation, Chares was reduced to such des-&#xD;
pair, that he hanged himself before he had finished&#xD;
nis work: the honour of which he left to his count ry-&#xD;
man Laches Lindius. Thu the one having finish-&#xD;
ed what the other began, it is easy to reco ncile&#xD;
those authors, who attribute the building of the&#xD;
Colossus to either of these two different architects.&#xD;
The legs of this statue were so extended, that&#xD;
one was placed onV each side the harbour, through&#xD;
which a passage was left, large and wide enough&#xD;
for vessels to enter under full sail-and the thumb&#xD;
of this extraordinary figure was so great that no&#xD;
-man could grasp it. It had in its right hand a sea&#xD;
light, or fire; for lighting which there was the con-&#xD;
venience of a stair-case in the inside, the stones of&#xD;
which served as a counterpoise to it.&#xD;
This wonderful statue stood but 56 years. An&#xD;
earthquake overthrew it, A. M. 3742i. Part of the&#xD;
''agmenis, which fell upon the land, lay there 865&#xD;
years, but when the Saracens took possession of&#xD;
the city of Rhodes, A. D. 050, Maurion, Sultan of&#xD;
Egypt and Persia, caused 900 camels to be laden&#xD;
with the brass which was found upon the land, and&#xD;
sold it to a Jew merchant, called Emessences.&#xD;

&#xD;
XVithout doubt, the greater part fell into the sea,&#xD;
notwithstanding the, earthquake threw it down&#xD;
towards the land side. This statue cost 800 attic&#xD;
talents in money.&#xD;
Those who are acquainted with the obelisk and&#xD;
Pompey's column, of one entire })iece of granite&#xD;
marble, will be the less surprised at the mechanic&#xD;
capacity of the ancients, in raising such a prodi-&#xD;
gious statue. And though we should allow the con-&#xD;
jecture of some, that those large pieces of granite&#xD;
(the like of which no quarries of latter times have&#xD;
discovered)are rather the produce of some lost art&#xD;
than of nature; yet the great stones, all of the piece,&#xD;
on the tops of the pyramids of Cairo, ivill always&#xD;
stand as incontestable proofs of their great skill, in&#xD;
raising burdens of a stupendous weight&#xD;

LAST MOMENTS OF THE MOTHER OF BONAPARTE&#xD;
THE evening preceding her death, she called to~&#xD;
gather all her household, she was supported on&#xD;
white velvet pillows, her bed was crimson damask,&#xD;
and in the ~entre hung a crown decorated with&#xD;
flowers, the whole of the apartment was lighted in&#xD;
grand style. S l~ e called her servants, one after an-&#xD;
other, to her bej -side, who knelt and kissed her ex-&#xD;
tended hand, which was skinny, and covered with a&#xD;
profusion of rings. To her chief director df' finances,&#xD;
Juan Berosa, she said, "Juan.,my.blessinggo with&#xD;
thee, and thine." rI~o Maria Belgrady, her waiting&#xD;
maid, she said, "Go to Jerome, he will take c~iIe&#xD;
of thee; when my grand son is Emperor of France&#xD;
he will make thee a great woman." She then call-&#xD;
ed Col. Darrcy to her bed-side; he had attended&#xD;
her in all her fortunes, and in Napoleon's will had&#xD;
assigned him a donation of ~t~14 ,OO0. " You," said&#xD;
she, " have been a good friend to inc and my family;&#xD;
I have left you what will make you happy ; never&#xD;
&#xD;
46&#xD;
&#xD;
REMARKABLE CHICI~EN~&#xD;
&#xD;
forget my grand son, and what he and you may ar-&#xD;
rive at is beyond my discerning; but you will both&#xD;
be great."&#xD;
She then called in all her junior servants, and&#xD;
with a pencil, as their names were called, marked.&#xD;
down a sum of money to be given to each, they&#xD;
were then dismissed, and she declared she had done&#xD;
with the world, and requested water, she washed&#xD;
her hands, and laid down upon her pillow. Her&#xD;
attendants found her 4ead, with her hand under her&#xD;
head, and a prayer book upon her breast.&#xD;
Thus died the mother of one who has been a me-&#xD;
teor on earth, and a blazing star to direct others!&#xD;
She had some amiable qualities, and considering&#xD;
that her rise from poverty to wealth was so rapid,&#xD;
her way of conducting herself, and proud manner,&#xD;
may be pardonable. She did much good from os-&#xD;
tentation, and died regretted for What she could do,&#xD;
not lamented by any one, for what she had done.&#xD;

A CHiCKEN WITH A HUMAN COUNTENANCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
LAST year a Jew exhibited for money, at Posen,&#xD;
in South Prussia, a chicken with a human counte-&#xD;
iiance. This chicken was hatched on an estate&#xD;
near ~Wreschen, (i. e. ~Wrzesnia,) in the district of&#xD;
Posen; and the Jew had accepted of it as an equiva-&#xD;
lent for a tailor's small bill, due to him by the own-&#xD;
er of the estate, who asserted, that another similarly&#xD;
formed chicken had been the same time hatched by&#xD;
the same hen, but soon after died.-The chicken&#xD;
which was shewn by the Jew survived, had a vei~&#xD;
lively appearance, was full grown, and above a year&#xD;
old. The body was covered with variegated feath-&#xD;
ers, and as far as the part of the neck, where the&#xD;
head begins, in no respect distinguished by any&#xD;
singularity from other chickens. The head did not&#xD;
exceed in size that of other chickens, but it was&#xD;

without feathers,'and covered with a skin of a some&#xD;
what bluish colour.~ The sockets of the eyes were&#xD;
shaped exactly as in a human countenance, and over&#xD;
them, two arches of very fine down, formed regular&#xD;
eye-brows. The upper' payt of the bill was so bent&#xD;
and blunted off, as to form a well sh4ed nose, ex-&#xD;
cepU that it was of a horny substance. Under the&#xD;
nose a regular human' mouth, with lips, and two&#xD;
rows of closely united, white pointed teeth, com-&#xD;
pleted this singular lusus nature. The tongue was&#xD;
rounded and shaped like a human tongue. Indeed&#xD;
the whole countenance had so astonishingly exact a&#xD;

AN EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF SPONTANEOUS HUMAN&#xD;
COMBUSTION.&#xD;
THE widow Hacquin, of Bar-le-Duc, aged 55&#xD;
years, who lived quite easy upon the interest of her&#xD;
property in the Sinking Fund, died a few days since,&#xD;
n the most deplorable and astonishing manner.&#xD;
We presume that this death is a new example of&#xD;
the phenomena called spontaneous human comhus~.&#xD;
lion. This woman, who was corpulent, was, ac-&#xD;
cording to report, in the habit of using spiritous&#xD;
liquors imprudently. A vase which stood near here&#xD;
filled with burning coals, determined the inflama-&#xD;
tion of ~ body. She was burnt to a cinder in-&#xD;
ward~y. The extremities were not affected. The&#xD;
room and her clothing also escaped the fire.&#xD;

PIIILIv the second, successor to the Emperor&#xD;
Charles the fifth, being at war with the Algerines,&#xD;
issued ordei~s for leaving recruits at Granada, a fa-&#xD;
*    mous city in Spaiii. As soon as the men were en-&#xD;
listed, they received billets for lodging at the houses&#xD;
of the inhabitants till the following day, when they&#xD;
were sent off to the army. Among others, they en-&#xD;
listed a young man possessed of great personal&#xD;
bep4uty, and ended with a considerable portion of&#xD;
*    wit, as the sequel of our tale will show. After re-&#xD;
*     ceiling his billet, he repaired to the house to which&#xD;
it was addressed, but it was late in the evening be-&#xD;
fore he arrived. having knocked at the door, a ser-&#xD;
vant made her appearance, and asked what he&#xD;
ventedd? to which he replied, that he had the. king's&#xD;
order for passing the night there. The maid having&#xD;
acquainted her mistress with his business, she came&#xD;
down stairs, and told him, as she was recently mar-&#xD;
ried, and her husband absent from home, she could&#xD;
not think of receiving a man into her house on any&#xD;
account whatever. The soldier, however, unwilling&#xD;
to admit the justice of her delicate scruples, told her&#xD;
that he was extremely sorry to put her to an incon-&#xD;
venience, but that it was now too late to seek for&#xD;
another lodging; his comrades had alletired to&#xD;
their respective places of destination, and lie felt no&#xD;
~ inclination to sleep in the street. "Put me where-&#xD;
ever you please," said he, "I will endeavour to&#xD;
give you as little trouble as possible: but remember&#xD;
my orders are positive, and if you persist in refusing&#xD;
me admission, you will reduce me to the disagree-&#xD;
able necessity of having recourse to violence." The&#xD;
*     lady was extremely mortified at this declaration&#xD;
which threatened to interruPt her evening's amuse&#xD;
inent: but finding it in vain to resist, she told hei&#xD;
maid to let him in, and put him to sleep in the gar&#xD;

"I have not supped madam," said the soldier, as&#xD;
he entered; "n~ot that I mean to ask you for, or sup-&#xD;
pose that you are obliged to furnish me with a sup-&#xD;
per-that the~ king takes care of-but as it is late&#xD;
and it would be impossible to get any thing in th~&#xD;
town at this hour-(for be it remarked that the&#xD;
cities in Spain, are not so well supplied with pub-'&#xD;
'lie houses as those of other European countries)-if&#xD;
you will be kind enough to provide me with some~~&#xD;
thing, 1 will cheerfully pay whatever you may re-&#xD;
quire~" "What !" replied the belle, with an air of&#xD;
disdain, "do you take my house for a wine house?&#xD;
Go to bed quietly, for yo.u shall have no supper&#xD;
here ?"&#xD;
The soldier, knowing a search for supper else-&#xD;
where would be fruitless, and fearing, moreover,&#xD;
that on his return he should find the door shut&#xD;
against him, resolved to bear his fate with patience,&#xD;
and retire to bed supperless. He was accordingly&#xD;
shown into a garret, half filled with lumber, in the&#xD;
corner of which stood a miserable bed. Though&#xD;
the accommodations were not such as, from the ap~&#xD;
pearance of the house, he had expected to find, he&#xD;
was obliged to accept them without a murmur; for&#xD;
besides that, the soldiers dare not give themselves&#xD;
those airs of importance, in Spain, which they are&#xD;
apt to display in other parts of the continent; they&#xD;
are more circumspect in their conduct, when quar..&#xD;
tered in large towns, than when they are posted in&#xD;
villages, where the inhabitants have no means of&#xD;
resistance.&#xD;
It is no wonder, that on such a bed, and an empty&#xD;
stomach, our hero was little disposed to sleep; he' ac-&#xD;
cordingly continued turning from side to side, with-&#xD;
out closing his eyes; about on e o'clock in the morn-&#xD;
ing he perceived a light through a crack in the floor&#xD;
of his garret; prompted by curiosity, he got out of&#xD;
bed, and applying his eye to ihe aperture, discover.~&#xD;
ed a handsome apartment, well furnished, where&#xD;
there was a large fire, with two spits loaded with&#xD;

game; but the best part of the sight was the mis&#xD;
tress of the house clasp ~d in the arms of a young ad&#xD;
locate, at least such he appeared by his dress. It&#xD;
is almost needless to observe, that the maid' was em-&#xD;
ployed in attending the game, and that the whole&#xD;
of the farce was exhibited in her presence.&#xD;
"Zounds!" said the soldier to himself, "is this the&#xD;
woman whose delicacy would not permit her to re-&#xD;
ceive a man into her house during her husband's&#xD;
absence !" But as he perceived the necessity of re-&#xD;
mainin'~ still for some time longer, he observed&#xD;
every tThng that passed without speaking a word,&#xD;
and already devoured with his eyes, the supper&#xD;
which he saw at the fire; a tantalizing sight foi~ a&#xD;
hungry man.&#xD;
At length he saw~ the cloth laid; and after some&#xD;
bottles of wine cooled in ice, according to the Span-&#xD;
ish custom, had been placed on the table, th elady&#xD;
and her inamorata took their seats. Before, how-&#xD;
ever, they had time to begin, a loud knock was&#xD;
heard at the door, and the maid running to the&#xD;
window to see who was there, hastily returned, and&#xD;
announced to 'her aifrighted mistress the arrival of&#xD;
her husband. "Alas madam," said she, "my mas-&#xD;
ter, whom you did not expect this week, is now at&#xD;
the door !" Fear and astonishment were now&#xD;
strongly depicted in the countenance of the fair in-&#xD;
constant, who was at a strange loss what to do with&#xD;
her lover. To conceal him was not possible, as the&#xD;
whole house was leb except the chamber in which&#xD;
they then were, father behind it, where the maid&#xD;
sle~4, and the garret where they had put the soldier.&#xD;
If she had bidden him in the maid's room, he could&#xD;
not have got out without being seen, as he would be&#xD;
obliged to pass through her own apartment; and she&#xD;
justly thought it would be risking too much, to en-&#xD;
trust the soldier with a secret she was so greatly in-&#xD;
terested to conceal; nor was it possible to let him&#xD;
down stairs, as there was but one stair-case in the&#xD;
house, and were he to attempt to descend it, he&#xD;

must infallible meet the husband, who now left no&#xD;
time for deliberation, as he continued to thunder 'at&#xD;
the door, with all his might. The only thing she&#xD;
could do, therefore, was to hide her lover under the&#xD;
bed, and to put the supper, wine, fruit, plate, dishes,&#xD;
&amp;amp;c. into a large wardrobe by the bed side, after&#xD;
which she seated herself with great composure by&#xD;
the fire.&#xD;
At length the husband, having gained admission,&#xD;
went up stairs, and the moment he entered the&#xD;
room,'his wife ran towards him, and throwing her&#xD;
arms about his neck, "Ha! my dear, what joy do I&#xD;
experience at the sight of you~ the pleasure too was&#xD;
so unexpected." "'Why my dear," replied the&#xD;
good man, "I finished my business much sooner than&#xD;
I expected, and I was so anxious to see you, that I&#xD;
returned with all possible speed. I have rode&#xD;
eighteen leagues to day, being resolved to get home&#xD;
at any rate, that I might not have to sleep in any of&#xD;
the miserable inns on the road. But how comes it&#xD;
that you have such a fire at this time of year ?"-" I&#xD;
have got a violent pain in my bowels," replied the&#xD;
wife, " and I had the fire lighted in order to warm a&#xD;
napkin to apply to the part. I believe the pain pro-&#xD;
ceeded from a fright occasioned by a soldier coming&#xD;
here to demand a lo(lging in the king's name;&#xD;
could not beat' the idea of admitting a man into the&#xD;
house in your absence, my dear." The soldier hear-&#xD;
ing his name mentioned, 'thought' this was the pro-&#xD;
per time for his appearance; he therefore dressed&#xD;
himself, and coming softly down stairs, applied his&#xD;
ear to the key-hole of the door, to listen to the con-&#xD;
versation, which still continued. "But this is not&#xD;
all my love," said the husband: "I have had no&#xD;
supper, and am half dead with hungry, have ymi&#xD;
nothingto give me?" "There is not any thing in&#xD;
the house," replied she, "you know I did not ex-&#xD;
pect you; and when you are from home, I generally&#xD;
content myself with a roasted apple." "It is very&#xD;
hard," said he, "to go to bed without supper, and it&#xD;
&#xD;
SOLDIER TURNED COO1~.&#xD;
&#xD;
seems I must, for there is nothing to be had at this&#xD;
time of night." The soldier hearing this, knocked&#xD;
at the door, which being opened, he saluted the hus-&#xD;
band, and apologized for the inconve4ence ~vhich&#xD;
he had occasioned his wife; he told him that he had&#xD;
come hither by the king's orders, and lest he might&#xD;
suspect his veracity, produced his billet. "Never..&#xD;
theless, sir," said he, "I trust the lady will do me&#xD;
the justice to own, that I have conducted myself&#xD;
with strict propriety." "Oh certainly !" answered&#xD;
the belle. "You have not 'supped, sir," resumed&#xD;
the soldier, "any more than myself; will you per-&#xD;
mit me to treat you and your wife? I assure youl&#xD;
can regale you in a sumptuous manner.,' "It is&#xD;
impossible, sir," said the husband, "search the&#xD;
whole town over, you will not be able to find a sin-&#xD;
gle thing at this time of night." "Do not trouble&#xD;
yourself about that," replied the soldier, "supper&#xD;
will soon be ready. I think I may. speak freely to&#xD;
you, for I am sure you ar~ too worthy a man to re-&#xD;
port me to the inquisition. You must know then,&#xD;
that I understand something of magic, and have a&#xD;
number of devils at my command. You shall pres-&#xD;
ently see what credit I have in the infernal re-&#xD;
gions, where, without vanity, there are as good&#xD;
cooks as any upon earth."&#xD;
Having said this, he took a piece of lighted wood&#xD;
from off the fire, and pronounced some incoherent&#xD;
expressions, which not being understood by himself,&#xD;
were of course unintelligible to every body else.&#xD;
At length he exclaimed, 'in a solemn and audible&#xD;
voice-" I command you Barthasibas, to bring sup-&#xD;
per for three without 'delay; and take care to let us&#xD;
have what is good.-What do you choose to eat,&#xD;

speak." " Whatever you please, sir," said the&#xD;
other, who was so frightened that his hair stood on&#xD;
an end. " Bring then," continued the soldier, " an&#xD;

cocks !" which were what he had seen at the fire.&#xD;
"Will that content you, sir? is that enough?" "0&#xD;
yes sir," replied the poor man, trembling' from head&#xD;
to foot, "and a great deal more than is necessary;&#xD;
we shall never be able to eat one half of it." "110&#xD;
ho! Barth asib us," resumed the ~ohlier, "a~dd a do-&#xD;
zen of larks; and be sure to let us have some good&#xD;
wine, old and cool, and a dessert too, well decked&#xD;
with sweetineats, and every other appendage. But&#xD;
no malice, do nothing that can frighten the lady.&#xD;
For which reason, I desire that every thing may be&#xD;
placed ready for eating, in yonder wardrobe, by the&#xD;
bed side.-Sir," said he to the husband, "you have&#xD;
only to open it, and be assured you will find every&#xD;
thing I have ordered." The wife, perceiving that&#xD;
she was detected, and that any opposition on her&#xD;
part, would only tend to expose her the more, has-&#xD;
tened to open the wardrobe herself, where she found&#xD;
all that had been mentioned, to the utter astonish-&#xD;
ment of her husband, who fancied himself in the&#xD;
other world. She hd~rself pretended to be equally&#xD;
surprised, and indeed had not less reason to be so,&#xD;
though not on the same account.&#xD;
The soldier, determined to sustain the part which&#xD;
he had assumed, ordered the cloth to he immedi-&#xD;
ately laid, that the supper might not get cold. As&#xD;
he was half dead with hunger, he seized the leg of a&#xD;
capon, which he devoured in a trice. "Taste it&#xD;
sir," said he, "believe me the flavour is delicious.~~&#xD;
The poor man, still shaking with fear, and fully&#xD;
persuaded that what he saw was solely the effect of&#xD;
magic, could scarcely summon up sufficient resolu-&#xD;
tion to obey. The wife also feigning a dread she&#xD;
did not experience, observed, that for her part, she&#xD;
could not think of touching a morsel. "Fear no-&#xD;
thing," said the soldier, "eat boldly and be assured&#xD;
you will find every thing of the best sort." The&#xD;
husband's hunger at length overcoming his fears,&#xD;
he ventured to yield to its dictates; and having by&#xD;
dint of persuasion induced his wife to follow his ex~&#xD;
54&#xD;
&#xD;
ample, they both agreed that~they had never eaten&#xD;
a better supper; the former in particular, observed&#xD;
that the cooks of hell were equally expert with&#xD;
those of Grenada.&#xD;
After supper, the soldier taking compassion on&#xD;
the poor advocate, whose fears, though powerful,&#xD;
had not subdued his appetite, was anxious to give&#xD;
him an opportunity of escaping from his prison;&#xD;
with this view, he thus addressed the master of the&#xD;
house :-" You must allow sir, that I have treated&#xD;
you like a gentleman; but that is not enough, I will&#xD;
now show you the spirit to whom we are indebted&#xD;
for our treat." " Heaven forbid!" exclaimed the&#xD;
wife, who trembled through fear of detection. "Do&#xD;
not be afraid," replied the soldier, who plainly per-&#xD;
ceived the cause of her alarm; "it is not what you&#xD;
imagine; I entertain too great a respect for the fair&#xD;
sex to disoblige one of them." The husband's op-&#xD;
rsition was not less violent, though it proceeded&#xD;
rom very different motive; but the soldier assur-&#xD;
ed him he need be under no apprehensions. "Ma-&#xD;
dam," said he to the wife, "order all the doors in&#xD;
the house to be opened, not forgetting the street&#xD;
door, for the moment I command him to begone, if&#xD;
he meets with any resistance, he will break through&#xD;

with this request, than the soldier, rising from his&#xD;
seat, exclaimed in a loud voice, "Barthasibas, thou&#xD;
who hast regaled us so handsomely, who now seest&#xD;
us, and hearest us, quick! begone! the doors are&#xD;

passant to the company, but not in your natural&#xD;
form, that you may not frighten the lady: as to The&#xD;
gentleman, there is no fear of alarming a man of&#xD;
his courage. Pray sir, in what shape would you&#xD;
desire to see him?" " Oh! in whatever shape you&#xD;
please sir," answered the husband. "Appear then&#xD;
in the dress of an advocate," resumed the solilier.&#xD;
The poor prisoner, finding so favourable an 01)&#xD;
portunity for effecting his escape, thrust his hat&#xD;

over his eyes, that he might not be known, and skip.&#xD;
ped across the chamber with the agility of a rope&#xD;
dancer. 'The husband, at sight of hinm, betrayed&#xD;
such symptoms of' fear, as almost discomposed the&#xD;
muscles of the soldier;'while the wife, in order to&#xD;
support the farce, sunk into a. pretended swoon.&#xD;
She was immediately undressed, and put 'to bed,&#xD;
whither the husband -followed her, and the soldier&#xD;
retired to his garret, much better disposed to sleep&#xD;
than before. The husband's thoughts were so en-&#xD;
tirely occupied on what he had seen, that he could&#xD;
neither think or talk upon any thing else during the&#xD;
whole night.&#xD;
The next morning the soldier came to take leave&#xD;
of his host, who returned him a thousand thanks;&#xD;
he then took post in the street, within sight of the&#xD;
door, where having waited till the husband was&#xD;
gone out, he returned to spay- his respects to the&#xD;
wife, who was still in bed, and on his appearance&#xD;
hid her face beneath the. bed-clothes. " Why -Ma-&#xD;
dam," said thie soldier, " should you refuse me the&#xD;
pleasure of seeing your face? Have I been unfortu--.&#xD;
nate enough to incur your displeasure?" " So far&#xD;
from it," said she, "that it, is the sense I entertain&#xD;
of the obligations you have imposed upon me, which&#xD;
makes me ashamed to appear before you." This&#xD;
confession extorted a reply equally gallant, and af-&#xD;
ter some conversation, he politely took his leave,&#xD;
highly pleased with the adventures of the night, and&#xD;
laughing heartily at the disappointment of the&#xD;
young advocate.&#xD;
This adventure soon became the talk of the town;&#xD;
and the husband was almost the only man in Gre-&#xD;
nada, who was ignorant of the deceptive parts of it'.&#xD;

EXTRAORDINARY FORTITUDE.&#xD;
EXTRAORDINARY FORTITUDE.&#xD;
&#xD;
.ONE day the Hurons, having the advantage in a&#xD;
skirmish, made an Iroquois chief captive, and he was&#xD;
brought to one of the Huron villages, where the fa-&#xD;
thers assembled. No sooner was he arrived, than it&#xD;
was decreed, in an assembly of the ancient savages,&#xD;
that he should be presented to one of their old chiefs,&#xD;
to replace his nephew, who had been killed in war,&#xD;
or to be disposed of as he should think proper. Bre-&#xD;
beuf, one of the Jesuits, immediately resolved to&#xD;
convert him to Christianity. The captive was&#xD;
clothed in a new beaver habit, with a curious neck-&#xD;
lace, and his temples were encircled with a kind of&#xD;
diadem: he .was surrounded by a troop of trium-&#xD;
phant warriours, and seemed to be quite unconcern-&#xD;
ed at his fate.&#xD;
When Brebeuf approached him, he perceived,&#xD;
that, before his fate was determined, he had been&#xD;
tortured. One of his hands had been crushed be-&#xD;
tween two flints, and he had lost a finger. His&#xD;
other hand had lost two, which had been cut off by&#xD;
a hatchet. The joints of his arms had been burnt,&#xD;
and a great gash appeared upon one of them. All&#xD;
this had been inflicted upon the poor wretch, before&#xD;
he entered the Huron village;- for he had no sooner&#xD;
arrived there, than he was treated with the greatest&#xD;
endearments, and a young woman was assignedehim&#xD;
f'or his wife. Sdch was this barbarian's situation&#xD;
when he was converted by Brebeuf; and he was&#xD;
esteemed to'be the first adult convert, that ever was&#xD;
made of the Iroquois nation; being baptized by the&#xD;
name of Joseph.&#xD;
All this while the captive was loaded with caress-&#xD;
es, and Brebeuf was suffered to take him to his tent&#xD;
every night; but his sores now became putrid andl&#xD;
full of worms. To increase his misery, he was car-&#xD;
ried in triumph from village to village, and where-&#xD;
ever he came he was obliged to sing, so that some&#xD;

times his voice entirely failed ~irn; nor had he the&#xD;
least respite, but when he was alone with Brebeuf,&#xD;
or some of' his missionaries. At last he was con-&#xD;
veyed to the village where the chief lived, who was&#xD;
to be the disposer of his fate. The, captive present~&#xD;
ed himself with an air perfectly unconcerned, to his&#xD;
supposed uncle, who after surveying him, talked to&#xD;
him in the following strain :-~-" Nephew," said he,&#xD;
"you cannot imagine the joy I conceived, when I&#xD;
understood that you were to supply the place of him&#xD;
whom] have lost' V had already prepared a mat for&#xD;
you in my cabin, and it was with the utmost satis~&#xD;
faction, that I resolved to pass the rest of my days&#xD;
with you in peace; but the condition I see you in,&#xD;
forces me to alter my resolution.&#xD;
"It is plain that the tortures you suffer, mwst ren~&#xD;
der your life insupportable to yourself, and you&#xD;
must think that I do you service in abridging its&#xD;
course. They who have mangled you in this man-&#xD;
ner, have caused your death. 'rake courage, there-&#xD;
fore, my dear nephew!-Prepare tlii~ ciening to&#xD;
show yourself a man, and that you are superior to&#xD;
the force of torments." The captive heard this dis-&#xD;
course with the greatest indifference, and only an-&#xD;
swered with a resolute voice, that it was very well.&#xD;
The sister of the deceased then served him with his&#xD;
victuals, and caressed him in the most affectionate&#xD;
manner, while the old chieftain put his own pipe in&#xD;
his mouth, and wiped the sweat from his brow, with&#xD;
the most te~der demonstrations of paternal love.&#xD;
Towards noon, the captive, at the expense of his&#xD;
supposed uncle, made his farewell feast, and while&#xD;
the inhabitants of the village were all assembled&#xD;
around him, he harangued 'them as follows:-&#xD;
"Brethren I am about to die. Divert yourselves&#xD;
boldly around me: be convinced that I am a man,&#xD;
and"that I neither fc~ar death, nor all the torments&#xD;
you can inflict." He then began a song, in which&#xD;
he was joined by the warriors who were present.&#xD;
He was then presented with victuals, and when the&#xD;
53&#xD;
&#xD;
EXTRAORDINARY FORTITUDE. '~&#xD;
&#xD;
feast was ended he was carried to the place of' exe-&#xD;
cution, which is called the cabin of blood; (or heads&#xD;
cut off,) and always belongs to the head of a village&#xD;
About eight o'clock in the evening, all the savages of&#xD;
the village being assembled, the young men who were&#xD;
to be executioners of the tragedy, forming the first&#xD;
row round th~ prisoner, were exhorted, by one of&#xD;
their infernal elders, to behave well, meaning there-&#xD;
by to put him to the most excruciating tortures.&#xD;
The prisoner was then seated on a mat, where his&#xD;
bands were tied, and then rising, he danced round&#xD;
the cabin, singing his death song all the time, and&#xD;
then replaced himself upon the mat.-Father Bre~.&#xD;
beuf favoured the world with a copy of his death&#xD;
song, which has been so much admired, as to have&#xD;
made its way through Europe, having been trans-&#xD;
lated into all the modern languages&#xD;
The sun sets in night, and the stars shun the day,&#xD;
But glory remains when their lights fade away;&#xD;
Begin you tormentors, your threats are in vain,&#xD;
For the son of Alknomook shall never complain.&#xD;
Remember the arrows he shot from his bow;&#xD;
Remember your chiefs by his hatchet laid low:&#xD;
Why so slow'! do you wait till I shrink from my pain ~&#xD;
No-the son of Alknomook shall never complain.&#xD;
Remember the wood-~-where in ambush we lay,&#xD;
And the scalps which we bore from your nation away:&#xD;
Now the flame rises fast! von exult in my pain;&#xD;
But the son of Alknomook shall never complain.&#xD;
I go to the land where my father ha~ gone;&#xD;
His ghost shall rejoice in the fame of his son:&#xD;
Death comes like a friend,-he relieves me from pain;&#xD;
And the son of Alknomook has scorned to complain.&#xD;
One of the elders then took from him his robe,&#xD;
which he said was destined for such a chief, (naming&#xD;
him) of such a village, who was to cut off his head,&#xD;
which, with an arm, was given to such another vil-&#xD;
lage, to feast upon it. According to the French&#xD;

which he did with most amazing firmness, without&#xD;
dropping the least reproachable word.&#xD;
He even talked of the affairs of his nation with as&#xD;
much indifference, as if he had been at home with&#xD;

THE VICTIM&#xD;
&#xD;
OF&#xD;
&#xD;
-ANToWNE.AUGUSTIN THOMAS DU. F-, eldest son&#xD;
of the baron du F-, counsellor of the parliament of&#xD;
Normandy, was born on the 15th of July, 1750.&#xD;
His early years were embittered by the severity of&#xD;
his father, who was of a disposition that preferred&#xD;
the exercise of domestic tyranny to the blessings of&#xD;
social happiness, and chose rather to be dreaded&#xD;
than beloved. The endearing name of father con-&#xD;
veyed no transpott to his heart, which,-being-wrapt&#xD;
up in stern insensibility, was cold even to the Com&#xD;
"The baron's austerity was not indeed confined to&#xD;
his son, but extended to all his dependants. Form-&#xD;
ed by nature for the support of the ancient govern-&#xD;
ment of F'rance, he maintained his aristocratic rights&#xD;
with unrelenting severity, ruled his feudal tenures&#xD;
with a rod of iron, and considered the lower order&#xD;
of people, as a set of beings whose existence was&#xD;
tolerated merely for the use of the nobility. The&#xD;
poor, he believed, were only born for suffering; and&#xD;
he determined, as far as in him lay, not to deprive&#xD;
them of their natural inheritance. ~On the whole,&#xD;
if it were the great purpose of human life to be&#xD;
hated, perhaps no- person ever attained that end&#xD;
more completely than the baron du F-.&#xD;
His son discovered early a taste for literature, and&#xD;
received an education suitable to his rank and for&#xD;
tune. As he advanced in life, the treatment he ex&#xD;

perienced from his father became more and more in.&#xD;
tolerable to him, as, far from inheriting the same&#xD;
character, he possessed the most amiable disposition,&#xD;
and the most feeling heart.&#xD;
His mother, feeble alike in mind and body, sub-&#xD;
mi~ted with the helplessness, and almost with the&#xD;
thoughtlessness of a child, to the imperious will of&#xD;
her husband. Their family was increased by two&#xD;
more sons, and two daughters; but these children,&#xD;
being several years younger than Mons. (lu F-,&#xD;
were not of an age to afford him the consolations of&#xD;
friendship; and the young man would have found&#xD;
his situation intolerable, but for the sympathy of a&#xD;
person, in whose society every evil was forgotten.&#xD;
This person, his attachment to whom has tinc-&#xD;
tured the colour of his lifer, was the youngest of eight&#xD;
children, of a respectable family of Bourgeois at&#xD;
Rouen. There is great reason to believe that her&#xD;
father was descended froii the younger branch of a&#xD;
noble~ family of the same name, and bearing the&#xD;
same arms. But, unhappily, some links were \vant-&#xD;
ing in this chain of ~onourable parentage. The&#xD;
claim to nobility could not be traced t8 the entire&#xD;
satisfaction of the baron; who, though he would&#xD;
have dispensed with any moral qualities in favour of&#xD;
rank, considered obscure birth as a radical stain,&#xD;
which could not be wiped off by all the virtues under&#xD;
heaven. He looked upon marriage as merely a&#xD;
convention of interest, and children as a property,&#xD;
of which it was reasonable for parents4o make the&#xD;
most in their power.&#xD;
The father of Mademoiselle Monique C-, was a&#xD;
farmer, and died three months before the birth of&#xD;
this child; who, with seven t4her children, was edu-&#xD;
cated with the utmost care, by their mother, a wo-&#xD;
man of sense and virtue, beloved by all to whom she&#xD;
was known. It seemed as if this respectable woman&#xD;
had, after the death of her husband, only supported&#xD;
life for the sake of her infant family, from ~vhoxyi she&#xD;
was snatched by death, the moment her maternal&#xD;
&#xD;
PARENTAL TYRANNY.&#xD;
&#xD;
cares became no longer necessary; her youngest&#xD;
daughter, Monique, halTing, at this period, just at-&#xD;
tained her twentieth year. Upon the death of her&#xD;
mother, Monique went to live with an aunt, with&#xD;
whom she remained only a very short time, being&#xD;
invited by Madam dii F-, to whom she was well&#xD;
known, to come and live with her as an humble&#xD;
companion, to read to her when she was disposed to&#xD;
listen, and to enliven the sullen grandeur of the&#xD;
chateau, by her animating vivacity.&#xD;
'rhis young person had cultivated her excellent&#xD;
understanding by read ink, and her heart stood in no&#xD;
need of cultivation. Mons. du F- found, in the&#xD;
charms of her conversation, and in the sympathy of&#xD;
her friendship, the most soothing consolation under&#xD;
the rigour of parentaL tyranny. Living several&#xD;
years beneath the same roof, he had constant op-&#xD;
portunities of observing her disposition and charac-&#xD;
ter; and the passion with which she at length in-&#xD;
spired him, was founded on the lasting basis of es-&#xD;
tee iii.&#xD;
If it was ever pardonable to deviate from that law,&#xD;
in the code of interest and etiquette, which forbids&#xD;
the heart to listen to its best emotions, which, stifling&#xD;
every generous sentiment of pure disinterested at-&#xD;
tachment, sacrifices love at the shrine of avarice or&#xD;
ambition, the virtues of Mon ique were such as might&#xD;
excuse this deviation. Yes, the character, the con-&#xD;
duct of this amiable person, have nobly justified her&#xD;
lover's choice. How long might we have vainly&#xD;
sought, in the highest classes of society, a mind so&#xD;
elevated above the common mass! a mind that, en-&#xD;
dowed with the most exquisite sensibility, has had&#xD;
sufficient firmness to sustain, with a calm and equal&#xD;
spirit, every transition of fortune; the most severe&#xD;
to bear, the trial of high prosperity.&#xD;
trials of adversity, and perhaps, what is still more&#xD;
dii F~- had been taught, by his early mis-&#xD;
fortunes, that domestic happiness was the first good&#xD;

Mons. and Madame du F- were relieved from&#xD;
Ibis extremity of distress, at a moment so critical,&#xD;
and by means so unexpected, that it seemed the&#xD;
hand of Heaven visibly interposing in behalf of op-&#xD;
pressed virtue. Early in the morning of that fatal&#xD;
day,~ when they were to leave their last sad shelter,&#xD;
Mons. du F- ivent out, arid, in the utmost distrac-&#xD;
tion of mind, wandered through some of the streets&#xD;
in the neighbourhood. He was, stopped by a gen~&#xD;
tkman, whom he had known at Geneva, and wh~&#xD;
told him that he was then in1search of his lodging,&#xD;
having a letter to deliver to him from a Genevois&#xD;
clergyman. Mons. du F- opened the letter, in&#xD;
which he was informed by his friend, that, fearing&#xD;
he friight be involved in difficulties, he had trans-&#xD;
mitte(I ten guineas to a banker in town, and entreat-&#xD;
ed Mons. da F-- would accept that small relief,&#xD;
which was all he could afford, as a testimony of&#xD;
friendship. Mons. du F- flew to the banker's, re-&#xD;
ceived the money as the gift of Heaven, and then,&#xD;
hastening to his wife and child, bade them live a&#xD;
little longer.&#xD;
A short time after he obtained a' situation as&#xD;
French usher at a school; and Madame du F-,&#xD;
when she had a little recovered her strength, put&#xD;
out her infant to nurse, and procured the place of&#xD;
Frecch teacher at a boarding school. They were&#xD;
now enabled to support their child, and to repay the&#xD;
generous assistance of their kind friend at Geneva.&#xD;
At this l)eriod they heard of the death of their son,&#xD;
whom they had left at Caen.&#xD;
Mon~, and Madame du F- passed two years in&#xD;
this situation, when they were again plunged into&#xD;
the deepest (listI'e55. A French jeweler was corn-&#xD;
flhiSSionC(l by the baron du F- to gd to his son, and&#xD;
~ to him conditions of reconciliation. rphis&#xD;
man told Mons. du F- that his father was just re-&#xD;
covered from a severe and dangerous illness, and&#xD;
that his eldest (laughter had lately died. These&#xD;

sister's death might have softened the mind of his     ture with his father's agent, who was to accompany&#xD;

pointed those ambitious hopes of a great alliance,     operations for his journey with anguish which she         $&#xD;
which his father had fondly indulged, and to whom      could ill conceal. But she felt that the delicacy of&#xD;
he owed, at least, the reparation of hastening to in-  her situation forbade her interference. It was she&#xD;
poring his forgiveness when he was willing to be-     who had made him an alien from his family, and an&#xD;

tions? she was, therefore, sensible that the duty&#xD;
the gratitude she owed her husband, now required)&#xD;
on her part, the absolute sacrifice of her own feel~.&#xD;
ings: she suffered without complaint, and endea~&#xD;
poured to resign herself to the will of Heaven.&#xD;
The day before his departure Mons. dii F- went&#xD;
to take leave 'of his little girl. At this moment a&#xD;
dark and melancholy presage seemed to agitate his&#xD;
mind. lie pressed the child for a long while to his&#xD;
bosom, and bathed it with his tears. The nurse&#xD;
eagerly inquired what was the rnatter3 and assured&#xD;
him that the child was perfectly well. Mons. dii&#xD;
F~- had no power to reply; he continued clasping&#xD;
his infant in his arms, and at length, tearing himself&#xD;
from her in silence, he rushed out of the house.&#xD;
When the morning of his departure came, Ma-&#xD;
dame dii F-, addressing herself to his fellow-tra-&#xD;
veller, said to him, with a voice of supplication, " I&#xD;
entrust you, sir, with my husband, with the father&#xD;
of my poor infant, our sole protector and support!&#xD;
have compassion on the widow and the orphan!"&#xD;
The man, casting upon her a gloomy look, gave her&#xD;
a cold answer, which made her soul shrink within&#xD;
her. When Mons. du F- got into the Brightelm-&#xD;
stone stage, he was unable to bid her farewell; but&#xD;
when the carriage drove off, he put his head out of&#xD;
the window, and continued looking after her; while&#xD;
~he fixed her eyes on him, and might have repeated,&#xD;
with Imogen.&#xD;
"I would have broke mine eye-strings;&#xD;
Cracked them, but to look upon him; till the diminution&#xD;
Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle;&#xD;
Nay, followed him, till he had melted from&#xD;
The smallness of a gnat to air; and then-&#xD;
Then turned mine eyes and wept!"&#xD;
When the carriage was out of sight, she summon&#xD;
ed all her strength, and walked with trembling steps&#xD;
to the school where she lived as a teacher. With&#xD;
much difficulty she reached the door; but her limbs&#xD;
'h)&#xD;
&#xD;
PARENTAL TYRANNY.&#xD;
&#xD;
could support her no longer, and she fell down&#xD;
senseless at the threshold. She was carried into the&#xD;
house, and restored to 'life and the sensations of&#xD;
misery.&#xD;
Mons. dii F- arrived at his father's chateau, in&#xD;
Normandy, in June, 1775, and was received by&#xD;
Mons. le baron, and all his family, with the most&#xD;
affectionate cordiality. In much exultation of mind&#xD;
he dispatched a letter to Madame dii F-, contain-&#xD;
ing this agreeable intelligence; but it was far from&#xD;
producing in her mind the effect he desired. A&#xD;
deep melancholy had seized her thoughts, and her&#xD;
foreboding heart ref to sympathise in his joy.&#xD;
Short, indeed, was its duration. He had not been&#xD;
many days at the chateau, when he perceived, with&#xD;
surprise and consternation, that his steps were con-&#xD;
tinually watched by two servants, armed with&#xD;
fuzees.&#xD;
His father now showed him an arret, which, on&#xD;
the fourth of June, 1776, he had obtained from the&#xD;
parliament of Rouen, against his marriage. The&#xD;
baron then ordered his son to accompany him to his&#xD;
house at Rou~n, whither they went, attended by&#xD;
several servants. That evening, when the atte&#xD;
dants withdrew after supper, the baron, entirely&#xD;
throwing off the mask of civility and kindness&#xD;
which he ha.d worn in such opposition to his nature,&#xD;
reproached his son, in terms of the utmost bitter-&#xD;
ness, for his past conduct, inveighed against his&#xD;
marriage; and having exhausted every expression&#xD;
of rage and resentment, at length suffered him to&#xD;
retire to his own apartment.&#xD;
There the unhappy Mons. du F-, absorbed in&#xD;
the most gloomy reflections, lamented in vain that&#xD;
fatal credulity which had led him to put himself into&#xD;
the power of his implacable father. At the hour of&#xD;
midnight his meditations were interrupted by the&#xD;
sound of feet approaching his chamber; and in a&#xD;
few moments the door was thrown open, and his&#xD;
father, attended by a servant armed, and two&#xD;

Cavaliers de Marechaussee,* entered the room.&#xD;
Resistance and supplications were alike unavailing.&#xD;
Mons. du F-'s papers were seized; a few louis&#xD;
'l'ors, which constituted all the money he possessed,&#xD;
were taken from him; and he was conducted, in the&#xD;
dead of the night, .Tulythe 7th, 1778, to St. You, a&#xD;
convent used as a place of confinement, near Ronen,&#xD;
where he was thrown into a dungeon.&#xD;
A week after his father entered the dungeon.&#xD;
You will perhaps conclude, that his hard heart felt&#xD;
at length, the relentings of a parent. You will at&#xD;
least suppose that his imagination being haunted,&#xD;
and his conscience tormented with the image of a&#xD;
son stretched on the floor of this subterraneous cell,&#xD;
he could support the idea no longer, and had hasten-&#xD;
ed to give repose to his own mind, by releasing his&#xD;
captive. Far different were the motives of his visit.&#xD;
He considered that such was his son's attachment&#xD;
to his wife, that so long as he believed he had left&#xD;
her in possession of seven hundred pounds, he would&#xD;
find comfort from that consideration even in the&#xD;
depth of his dungeon. His father, therefore, hast~&#xD;
ened to remove an error from the mind of his son,&#xD;
which left the measure of his woes unfilled. Nor&#xD;
(lid he choose to yield to another the office of inflict-&#xD;
ing a pang sharper than captivity; but himself in-&#xD;
formed his son, that the merchant, who was to pay&#xD;
the seven hundred pounds to his wife, was declared&#xD;
a bankrupt.&#xD;
A short time after, the baron du F-. commenced&#xD;
a suit at law, against that agent of iniquity, whom&#xD;
he had employed to deceive his son, and who, prac&#xD;
tising a refinement of treachery, of which the baron&#xD;
was not aware, had kept the seven hundred pounds,&#xD;
with which he was entrusted, and given drafts upon&#xD;
a merchant whom he knew would fair before the&#xD;
time of. payment. Not being able to prosecute the&#xD;
~air without a power of attorney from his son, the&#xD;

baron applied to him for Ibis ~ But Mon%&#xD;
dii F-, being firmly rcsolve(l not to deprive hi~&#xD;
wife of the chance of recovering the money for her-&#xD;
self and child, could, by no entreaties or menaces&#xD;
be led to comply. In vain his father, who had con~&#xD;
rented to allow him a few books, ordered him to be&#xD;
deprived of that resource, and that his confinement&#xD;
should be rendered still more rigorous; he continued&#xD;
n fle~ible.&#xD;
Mons. du F-. remained in his prison, without&#xD;
meeting with the smallest mark of sympathy fror~&#xD;
any ore of his family, though his second brother,&#xD;
Mons. de B-, was now eighteen years of age; an&#xD;
age at which the sordid considerations of interest,&#xD;
how much soever they may effect our conduct at a&#xD;
more advanced period of life, can seldom stifle those&#xD;
warm and generous feelings which seem to belong&#xD;
to youth. It might have been expected that this&#xD;
young man would have abhorred the prospect ~i&#xD;
possessing a fortune which was the just inheritance&#xD;
of his brother, and which could only be obtained by&#xD;
detaining that brother in perpetual captivity. Even&#xD;
admitting that his inexorable father had prohibited&#xD;
his visiting the l)rison of his brother, his heart&#xD;
should hare told him, that disobedience in this in-&#xD;
stance, would have 1)een virtue; or was it not&#xD;
sufficient to remain a passive spectator of injustice,&#xD;
without becoming, as he afterwards did, the agent&#xD;
of cruelty inflicted on a brother?&#xD;
Where are the wor(ls that can convey an ade-~&#xD;
quate idea of the sufferings of Madame du F-, (lur..&#xD;
ing this period? Three weeks after her husband's&#xD;
departure~ from England, she heard the general re~&#xD;
port of The town of Rouen, that the baron dii F.-..&#xD;
had obtained a lettre de cachet against his son, and&#xD;
had thrown him into l)rison. This was all she&#xD;
heard of her husband for two years. Ignorant of&#xD;
the I)lace of his confinement, uncertain if he still&#xD;
lived, perhaps her miseries were even more poig&#xD;
nant than his. In the dismal solitude of a prison,&#xD;

nis pains were alleviated by the soothing reflective&#xD;
that he suffered for her he loved; while that very&#xD;
idea was to ~her the most bitter aggravation of dis-&#xD;
tress. Her days passed in anguish 'which can only&#xD;
be conceived where it has been felt, and her nights&#xD;
were disturbed by the gloomy wanderings of fancy.&#xD;
Sometimes she saw him in her dreams, chained to&#xD;
the floor of'his dungeon, his bosom bathed in blood,&#xD;
and his countenance disfigured by death. Some-&#xD;
times she saw him hastcn~ng towards her, when, at&#xD;
the moment that he was going to embrace her, they&#xD;
were fiercely torn asunder. Madame du F- was&#xD;
naturally of a delicate constitution, and grief of&#xD;
mind reduced her to such a deplorable state of&#xD;
weakness, that it was with infinite difficulty she&#xD;
performed the duties of her situation. For herself,&#xD;
she would have welcomed death with thankfulness;&#xD;
but she considered that her child now depended en-&#xD;
tirely ~n her labours for support, and this was a mo-&#xD;
tive sufficiently powerful to prompt her to the care-&#xD;
ful preservation of her own life, though it had long&#xD;
become a burden. The child was three years old&#xD;
when her father left England; recollected him per-&#xD;
fectly; and, whenever her mother went to visit her,&#xD;
used to call with eagerness for her papa. The en-&#xD;
quiry in the voice of her child, of, "When shall I&#xD;
see my dear, 4ear papa?" was heard by this un&#xD;
happy mother with a degree of agony which it were&#xD;
vain indeed to describe.&#xD;
Mons. du F- was repeatedly offered his liberty&#xD;
but upon conditions which he abhorred. He was&#xD;
required forever to renounce his wife; who, while&#xD;
she remained with her child in a distant country,&#xD;
was to receive from his father a small pension, as an&#xD;
equivalent for the pangs of disappointed affection,&#xD;
of disgrace and dishonour. With the indignation&#xD;
of offended virtue, he spurned at these insulting pro-&#xD;
'ositions, and endeavoured to prepare his mind for&#xD;
the cndurancr' of perpetual captivity.&#xD;

dreadful than his prison, where he perceived with&#xD;
horror, that the greatest number of those prisoners&#xD;
who had been many years in confinement, had an&#xD;
appearance of frenzy in their looks, which showed&#xD;
that reason had been too weak for the long struggle&#xD;
with calamity, and h~d at last yielded to despair.&#xD;
In a cell adjoining Mons. du F-'s, was an old man&#xD;
who had been confined nearly forty years. his&#xD;
grey beard hung down to his waist, and during the&#xD;
(lay, he was chained by his neck to the wall. He&#xD;
was never allowed to leave his cell, and never spoke;&#xD;
but Mons. du F-, used to hear the rattling of his&#xD;
chains.&#xD;
The prisoners, a few excepted, were generally&#xD;
brought from their cells at the ho~ir of noon, and&#xD;
dined together. But this gloomy repast was served&#xD;
in uninterrupted silence. They were not suffered&#xD;
to utter one word, and the penalty of transgressing&#xD;
this rule, was a rigorous confinement of several&#xD;
weeks. As soon as this comfortless meal was finish-&#xD;
ed,.the l)risoners were instantly obliged to return&#xD;
to their dungeons, in which they were locked up till&#xD;
the same hour the following day. Mons. do F-,&#xD;
in his damp and melancholy cell, passed two win-.&#xD;
ters without fire, and suffered so severely from cold,&#xD;
that he was obliged to wrap himself up in the few&#xD;
clothes which covered his bed. Nor was he allow-&#xD;
ed any light, exeel)t that which, during the short&#xD;
day, beamed through the small grated window in&#xD;
the ceiling of his dungeon.&#xD;
Is it not difficult to believe that these sufferings&#xD;
*    were inflicted by a father?  A father! that name&#xD;
which 1 cannot trace without emotion; which con-&#xD;
veys all the ideas of protection, of security, of ten-&#xD;
(lerness; that dear relation, to which children, in&#xD;
general owe their prosperity, their ei~ijoyments, and&#xD;
even their virtues! Alas! the unhappy Mons. du&#xD;

from its earliest period, his cruelty had embittered&#xD;

and which he now condemned to languish in mise-&#xD;
ries that death only could heal.&#xD;
A young gentleman, who was confined in a cell&#xD;
on one side of Mons. du F-~'s, contrived to make a&#xD;
small hole through the wall; and these companions in&#xD;
misfortune, by placing themselves close to the hole,&#xD;
could converse together in whispers. But the&#xD;
monks were not long in disco' ering this, and effect-&#xD;
~ially deprived them of so great an indulgence, by&#xD;
removing them to distant cells. These unrelenting&#xD;
monks, who performed with such fidelity their&#xD;
office of tormenting their fellow creatures, who&#xD;
never relaxed in one article of persecution, and ad&#xD;
he red with scrupulous rigour to the code of cruelty,&#xD;
were called, " Les Freres de la saint Charite."4&#xD;
One among them deserved the appellation. This&#xD;
good old monk used to visit the prisoners by stealth,&#xD;
and endeavour to administer comfort to their afflic-&#xD;
tion. Often he repeated to Mons. (lu F-, "Mon&#xD;
cher frere console vous; mettez i'otre confiance&#xD;
en Dieu, vos maux seront finis!"t&#xD;
Mons. (lu F- remained two years in prison,&#xD;
without receiving any intelligence of his wife, on&#xD;
whose account he suffered the most distracting anx-&#xD;
iety, He had every reason to apprehend that her&#xD;
frame, which had already been much enfeebled by&#xD;
her misfortunes, would sink beneath this additional&#xD;
load of misery, and that she would perhaps be ren-&#xD;
dered unable to procure that little pittance, which&#xD;
might preserve herself and her. child from want.&#xD;
At length one of his fellow prisoners, who was&#xD;
ing to regain his liberty, took charge of a letter to&#xD;
Madame du F-, and flattered him with the hope of&#xD;
finding some means of transmitting to him an an-&#xD;
swer.&#xD;
The letter paints so naturally the situation of his&#xD;
mind, that I have translated some extracts from it.&#xD;

brought the letter to his (lungeon, dreading the risk&#xD;
of a discovery, inslSte(l that after having read it, he&#xD;
should return it to him immediately. Mons. dii&#xD;

his tears, and implored the indulgence of keeping it&#xD;
at least till the next morning. tie was allowed to&#xD;
do so, and read it till every word was imprinted on&#xD;
his memory; an.d after enjoying the sad luxury, of&#xD;
holding it that night on his bo~om, was forced, the&#xD;

On the 10th of October, 1730, th~ baron du F-~&#xD;
came to the convent, and ordered the monks to bxing&#xD;
his son from his di~'ageon to the parlor, and leave&#xD;
73&#xD;
&#xD;
them together. With the utmost reluctance Mons.&#xD;
dii F'- obeyed this summons, having long lost all&#xD;
hope of softening the obdurate heart of his father.&#xD;
When the monks withdrew, the baron b~gan upbraid-&#xD;
ing him, in the most bitter terms, for his obstinate&#xD;
resistance to his will, which he informed him, had&#xD;
availed nothing, as he had gained his suit at law, and&#xD;
recovere(l the seven hundred 1)Ounds. Mous. dii F-&#xD;
replied, that the pain he felt from this intelligence&#xD;
would have l)CCh1 far more acute, had his wife been&#xD;
deprived, with his concurrence, of the money which&#xD;
l)romised for her subsistence&#xD;

Ihat not merely were his affections interested, but&#xD;
that his honour oI)lige(1 him to maintain with invio-&#xD;
lable fidelity, a solemn and sacred engagement. The&#xD;
rage of the 1)aron at these words became unbounded.&#xD;
lie stam1)ed the ground with his feet; he. aimed a&#xD;
stroke at his son, who taking advantage of this mo-&#xD;
nient of frenzy, determined to attempt his escape,&#xD;
and rushing out of the apartment, and avoiding that&#xD;
side of the convent which the monks ir~habited, he&#xD;
endeavored to find his way to the garden, but missed&#xD;
the passage which led to it. He then flew UI) a stair&#xD;
case, from which he heard his father calling for assist-&#xD;
ance. Finding that all the (loors which he passed&#xD;
were shut, he continued ascending till he reached the&#xD;
toj) of the building, where meeting with no other&#xD;
opening than a hole made in the sloping roof to jet in&#xD;
light to a garret, he climbed up with much difficulty,&#xD;
and then putting his feet through the Ii ole, and let-&#xD;
ting his body out by degrees, he supported himself for&#xD;
a moment on the roof, and deliberated on what he was&#xD;
about to do. But his mind was at this crisis, wrought&#xD;
Ill) to a pitch of desperation, which mocked the sug-&#xD;
gestions of fear. He quitted his hold, and flinging&#xD;

sensible before he' reached the ground, where he lay&#xD;
weltering in his blood, and to all appearance dead.&#xD;
He had fallen on the high road leading from Ronen&#xD;
to Caen. Some people who were passing gathered&#xD;
round him, and one person having washed the blood&#xD;
from his face, instantly recognized his features, and&#xD;
exclaimed to the astonished crowdthat he was the el-&#xD;
dest son of the bar~n du F-. Upon examining his&#xD;
body, it was found that he had broken his arm, his&#xD;
thigh, his ancle bone, and his heel, besides having&#xD;
received many violent bruises. He still remained in&#xD;
a state of insensibility; and while these charitable&#xD;
strangers were using their efforts to restore him to&#xD;
life, the monks hastened from their convent, snatch-&#xD;
ed their victim from those good Samaritans, who&#xD;
would have poured oil and wine into his wounds,&#xD;
and carried him to the infirmary of the convent,&#xD;
where he remained some weeks before he recovered&#xD;
his senses; after which he lay stretched upon a bed&#xD;
for three months, suffering agonies of pain.&#xD;
His father, who had been the jailor, and almost&#xD;
the murderer df his son, heard of these sufferings&#xD;
without remorse, nor did he ever see him more.&#xD;
But though he was sufficiently obdurate to bear un-&#xD;
moved the calamities he had inflicted on his.child,&#xD;
though he could check the upbraidings of his own&#xD;
conscience, he could not silence the voice of public&#xD;
indignation. The report that Mons. du F- had&#xD;
been found lying on the road, bathed in blood, and&#xD;
had in that 'condition been dragged to the prison of&#xD;
St. Yon, was soon spread through the town of Rou-&#xD;
en. Every one syrnpathised in the fate of this un-&#xD;
fortunate young man, and execrated the tyranny of&#xD;
his unrelenting, father.&#xD;
'rhe universal clamour reached the ear of his&#xD;
brother, Mons (IC B-, who now, for the first time,&#xD;
out of respect to the J)ublic opinion, took a measure&#xD;
which his heart had never dictated during the long&#xD;
captivity of his brother, that of visiting him in his&#xD;
prison. Mons. de B-'s design in these visits was&#xD;

I will not attempt to describe the wretchedness of&#xD;
Madame du F-, when she heard the report of her&#xD;
husband's situation. Your heart will conceive what&#xD;
she suffered far better than I can relate it. rl~hree&#xD;
months after his fall, Mons. (lu F- contrived,&#xD;
through the assistance of the charitable old monk, to&#xD;
send her a few lines, written with his left hand.&#xD;
"My fall," he says, "has made my captivity&#xD;
known, and has led the whole town of Rouen to&#xD;
take an interest in my misfortunes. Perhaps I&#xD;
shall have reason to bless the accident, which may&#xD;
possibly prove the means of procuring me my liberty,&#xD;

will that moment compensate for all our or.&#xD;
tunes."&#xD;
At length the parliament of Rouen began to inter..&#xD;
est itself in the cause of Mons. dii F-. The cii'-&#xD;
cumstances of his confinement were mentioned in&#xD;
that assembly, and the president sent his secretary&#xD;
to Mons. dii F-'s prisonwho had now quitted his&#xD;
bed, and was able to walk with the assistance of&#xD;
crutches. By the advice of the president, Mons.&#xD;
du F- addressed some letters to the parliament, re-&#xD;
presenting his situation in the most pathetic terms,&#xD;
and imploringtheirinterference in his behalf.&#xD;
It is here necessary to mention, that Mons. de Bel&#xD;
B-, Procureur General de Rouen, being intimately&#xD;
connected with the baron du F-'s family, had ~Ten-&#xD;
tured to demonstrate his friendship for the ba~&#xD;
ron, by confining his son nearly three years on his&#xD;
own authority, and without any lettre de cachet.&#xD;
And though Muns. de Bel B- well knew, that every&#xD;
species of oppression was connived at, under the&#xD;
shelter of lettres de cachet, he was sensible that it&#xD;
was only beneath their auspices that the exercise of&#xD;
tyranny was p&amp;amp;mitted; and in this particular irk-&#xD;
stance, not having been cruel, felons les regles,~ he&#xD;
apprehended that if ever Mons. dii F- regained his&#xD;
liberty, he might be made responsible for his con-&#xD;
duct. He therefore exerted all his influence, and&#xD;
with too much success, to 'frustrate the benevolent&#xD;
intention of the president of the parliament, respect-&#xD;
ng Mons. du F-. His letters were indeed read in&#xD;
that assembly, and ordered to be registered, where&#xD;
they still remain a record of the pusillanimity of&#xD;
those men who suffered the authority of Mons. de&#xD;
Bel B-~- to overcome the voice of humanity; who ac-&#xD;
knowledged the atrocity of the baron dii F-'s con-&#xD;
duct, and yet were deaf to the supplications of hiB&#xD;

upon them for protection and redress.&#xD;
May the fate of the captive, in the land of France;&#xD;
no more hang suspended on the frail thread of pity,&#xD;
or the caprice of individuals! May justice erect, on&#xD;
eternal foundations, her protecting sanctuary for&#xD;
the oppressed, and may humanity and mercy be the&#xD;
graceful decorations of her temple.&#xD;
The baron (in F-, perceived that, notwithstand~&#xD;
ing his machinations had prevented the parliament&#xD;
of l{ouen from taking any effectual measures to-.&#xD;
wards liberating his son, it would be impossible to*&#xD;
silence the murmurs of the public, while he remain&#xD;
ed confined at St. Yon. He determined, therefQ~e,&#xD;
to remove him to some distant prison, where ~is&#xD;
name and family were unknown; and where, beyond&#xD;
the jurisdiction of the parliament of Ronen, his&#xD;
groans might rise, unpitied and unrevenged. But&#xD;
the baron, not daring, amidst the general clamour,&#xD;
to remove his son by force, endeavored to draw him&#xD;
artfully into the snare he had prepared.&#xD;
Mons. de B- was sent to his brother's prison,&#xD;
where he represented to him, that though he must&#xD;
not indulge the least hope of ever regaining his&#xD;
liberty, yet if he would write a letter to Mons. M&#xD;
keeper of the seals, desiring to be removed to some&#xD;
other place, his confinement would be made far less&#xD;
rigorous. Mons. dii F- was now in a state of des-&#xD;
l)eration, that rendered him almost careless ~of his&#xD;
fate, lie perceived that the parliament had re-&#xD;
flounced his cause. He saw no possibility of escape&#xD;
from St. Yon, and flattered himself that in a place&#xD;
where he was less closely confined, it might perhaps&#xD;
be practicable; and therefore he consented to write&#xD;
the letter required, which Mons. de B- conveyed&#xD;
ih triumph to his father. rl;here were, however,&#xD;
some expressions in the letter, which the baron dis-&#xD;
approved, on which account he returned it, desiring&#xD;
that those expressions might be changed. But duN&#xD;
ing the interval of his brother's absence, Mons dv&#xD;

F- had reflected on the rash imprudence of con.&#xD;
fading in the promises of those, by whom he had been&#xD;
so cruelly deceived. No sooner, therefore, did&#xD;
Moos. de B--- put the letter again into his hands,&#xD;
than he tore it in pieces, and peremptorily refused&#xD;
to write another.&#xD;
Soon after this, Mons. de B--, the ambassador of&#xD;
the tyrant, again returned to his brother, with fresh&#xD;
credentials, and declared to him, that if he would&#xD;
write to the keeper of the seals, desiring to be re&#xD;
moved from St. Yon, he should in one fortnight&#xD;
after his removal be restored to liberty. Upon&#xD;
Mons. du F-'s asserting that he could no longer&#xD;
confide in the promises made him by his family, his&#xD;
brother, in a formal written engagement, to which&#xD;
he signed his name, gave him the most solemn assur-&#xD;
ance, that his promise should be fulfilled with fide-&#xD;
lity. Mons. du F-. desired a few days for delibe-&#xD;
ration, and during that interval, found means of&#xD;
consulting a magistrate of Rouen, who was his&#xD;
friend, and who advised him to comply with the&#xD;
terms that were offered, after having caused several&#xD;
copies of the written engagement to be taken, and&#xD;
certified by such of the prisoners at St. Iron as were&#xD;
likely to regain their freedom; a precaution neces-&#xD;
sary lest his own should be torn from his hands.&#xD;
Thus, hating neither trusted to the affection, the&#xD;
mercy, or the remorse of those, within whose bosom&#xD;
such sentiments were extinguished; having bargain-&#xD;
ed by a written agreement, with a father and a&#xD;
brother, fbr his release from the horrors of perpetual&#xD;
cal)tivity, Mons. du F- wrote the letter required.&#xD;
Soon after, an order Was sent from Versailles, for&#xD;
his release from the prison of St. Yon, and with a&#xD;
l9ttre de cachet, whereby he was exile(l to Beauvais,&#xD;
with a command not to leave that town, Mons. de&#xD;
B-.', acting as a Cavalier de Ia Marechaussee,~&#xD;
conducted his brother to this place of exile, and&#xD;

there left him. A short time after, Moos. du F.-~&#xD;
received an intimation fron~ thai magistrate of Rou-&#xD;
en, who had interested himself in his misfortunes,&#xD;
that his father was on the point of obtaining another&#xD;
lettre de cachet, to remove him from Beauvais to&#xD;
some prison in the south of France, where he might&#xD;
never more be heard of. rJ7his gentleman added,&#xD;
that Mons. da F- had not one moment to lose, and&#xD;
advised him immediately to attempt his escape.&#xD;
Early on the morning after he received this intel~&#xD;
ligence, Mons. du F-, who had the liberty to walk&#xD;
about ~he town, fled from Beauvais. rrhe person&#xD;
Who brought him the letter from the magistrate,&#xD;
waited for him at a little distance from the town,&#xD;
and accompanied him on his journey. When they&#xD;
reached Lisle in Flanders, not having a passport,&#xD;
they were obliged to wait from eleven o'clock at&#xD;
night, till ten the next morning, before they could&#xD;
obtain permission from the governor to proceed on&#xD;
their journey. Moos. da F- concluded that he&#xD;
was pursued, and suffered the most dreadful appre-&#xD;
hensions of being overtaken. His companion, with&#xD;
some address, at length obtained a passport, and at-&#xD;
tended him as far as Ostend. The wind proving&#xD;
contrary, he was detained two days in a state of the&#xD;
most distracting inquietude, and concealed himself&#xD;
on board the vessel in. whicI~ he had taken his pas-&#xD;
sage for England. At length the wind became fa-&#xD;
vourable, the vessel sailed, and arrived late at night&#xD;
at Margate. Mons. du F-, when he r~e.a~ed the&#xD;
English shore, knelt down, and in a transporOof joy,&#xD;
kissed the earth of that dear country, which had&#xD;
twice proved his asylum.&#xD;
He then enquired when the stage coach set off&#xD;
for London, and was told that it went at so early an&#xD;
hour the next morning, that he could not go till the&#xD;
day after, as he must wait till his portmantean was&#xD;
examined by the custom-house officers, who were&#xD;
now in bed. The (lelay of a few hours, in seeing&#xD;

sufferings was not to be endured. In a violent agi-&#xD;
tation of mind, he snatched up his portmanteau, and&#xD;
was going to fling it into the sea, when he was pre-&#xD;
vented by the people near him, who said that if he&#xD;
would pay the fees, his portmanteau should be sent&#xD;
after him. He eager] y complied with their de-&#xD;
mands, and set out for London. As he drew near,&#xD;
his anxiety, his impatience, his emotion increased.&#xD;
His present situation appeared to him like one of&#xD;
those delicious dreams, which sometimes visited the&#xD;
darkness of his dungeon, and for a while restored&#xD;
him, in imagination, to those he loved. Scarcely&#xD;
could he persuade himself that he was beyond the&#xD;
reach of oppression, that he was in a land of free-&#xD;
dom; that he was hastening towards his wife and&#xD;
child. When he entered London, his sensations be-&#xD;
came almost too strong to bear. He was in the&#xD;
very same place his wife and child inhabited-but&#xD;
were they still alive? were they in health? had&#xD;
Heaven indeed reserved for him the transport of&#xD;
holding them once more to his bosom, of mixing his&#xD;
tears with theirs? When heknocked at the door&#xD;
of the house, where he expected to hear of Madame&#xD;
du F-, he had scarcely power to articulate his en-&#xD;
quiries after her and his child. He was told that&#xD;
they were in health, butihat Madame du F- being&#xD;
in a situation six miles from London, he could not&#xD;
see her till the next morning. Mons. dii F.-~ had&#xD;
not been in bed for several nights, and was almost&#xD;
overcome with agitation and fatigue. He, however,&#xD;
instantly set out on foot for the habitation of his wife,&#xD;
announced himself to the' mistress of the family, and&#xD;
remained in another apartment, while she, after&#xD;
making Madame du F- promise that she would&#xD;
listen to her with calmness, told her that there was&#xD;
a probability of heit husband's return to England.&#xD;
He heard the sobs, the exclamations of his wife at&#xD;
this intelligence-he could restrain no longer-he&#xD;
rushed into the room-he flew into her arms-he&#xD;
continued pressing her in silence to his bosom. She&#xD;
86&#xD;
&#xD;
';1&#xD;
&#xD;
was unable to shed a tear, and it was not until long&#xD;
after he had endeavored to sooth her by his ten..&#xD;
derness, and had talked to her of her child, that she&#xD;
obtained relief from weeping. She then with the&#xD;
most violent emotion, again and again repeated the&#xD;
same inquiries, and was a considerable time before&#xD;
she recovered any degree of composure.&#xD;
All the fortune Mons. du F- possessed, when he&#xD;
reached London, was one half guinea; but his wife&#xD;
had~ during his absence, saved ten guineas out of&#xD;
her little salary. You will easily imagine how valu-&#xD;
able this hoard became in her estimation, when she&#xD;
could apply it to the precious use of relieving the&#xD;
necessities of' her husband. Mons. du F- went to&#xD;
London the next day, and hired a little garret:&#xD;
there, with a few books, a rush light, and some&#xD;
straw, in which he wrapt his legs to supply the want&#xD;
of fire, he recollected not the splendour to which he&#xD;
had once been accustomed, nor the dungeon from&#xD;
which he had escaped, he saw his wife and child&#xD;
once a week; and in those solitary moments, when&#xD;
books failed to sooth his thoughts, he anticipated the&#xD;
hour when he should again meet the objects most&#xD;
dear to his heart, and passed the intervals of' time&#xD;
in philosophical resignation. His clothes being too&#xD;
shabby to admit of his appearing in the day, he issu-&#xD;
ed from his little shed when it was dark, and en-&#xD;
deavoured to warm himself by the exercise of walk-&#xD;
ing.&#xD;
Unfortunately he caught the small pox, and his&#xD;
disorder rose to such a height, that his life was des-&#xD;
paired of. In his delirium he used to recapitulate&#xD;
the sad Story of his misfortunes:and when he saw&#xD;
any person near his bed side, would call out, with&#xD;
the utmost vehemence, " Qu'on sasse sortir touts&#xD;

&#xD;
PARENTAL TYRANNY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Six months after Mons. du F-'s return to&#xD;
iand, his family found themselves compelled to SL&#xD;
lence the public clamours, by allowing im a small&#xD;
annual pension. Upon this, Madame du F- quit-&#xD;
ted her place, and came to live with her husband&#xD;
and her child, in an obscure lodging. Their little&#xD;
income received some addition, by means of teach-&#xD;
ing the French language in a few private families.&#xD;
A young lady, -who came to pay me a visit at&#xD;
London, in 1785, desired to take some lessons in&#xD;
French, and Madame du F- was recommended to&#xD;
us for that purpose. We soon perceived, in her&#xD;
conversation, every mark of a cultivated mind, and&#xD;
of an amiable disposition. She at length told us&#xD;
the history of her misfortunes, and with the pathetic&#xD;
eloquence of her own charming language; and after&#xD;
having neard that recital, it required but common&#xD;
humanity to treat her with the respect due to the&#xD;
unhappy, and to feel for her sorrows that sympathy&#xD;
to which they had such Jaim. How much has the&#xD;
sensibility of Mons. and Ma(larne du F- over-rated&#xD;
those 1)rQofS of esteem and friendship~, which we&#xD;
were enabled to shew them in their adversity .-But&#xD;
I must not anticipate.&#xD;
On the 7th of October, 1787, the baron died,&#xD;
leaving, besides Mons. du F-, two other sons and a&#xD;
daughter.&#xD;
I must here mention that at the time when Mons.&#xD;
du F- was confined to his b~d in the prison of St&#xD;
Yon, from the consequences s of his fall, his father in&#xD;
order to avoid the clamours at Ronen, ~vent for some&#xD;
weeks to Par ri. He there made a will disinherit~&#xD;
ing his eldest son. By the old laws of France, how-&#xD;
ever~a father could not punish his son more than once&#xD;
for the same offence. Nor was there any thing in so&#xD;
mild a clause that could much encourage disobedi-&#xD;
ence; ~nce this single punishment of which the mer-&#xD;
cy of 'lie law was careful to avoid repetition, might'&#xD;
be eytended to residence for life in a dungeon. Such&#xD;
w~s evidently the intention of the baron du F--; and&#xD;

though hi~ son disappointing this intention, had&#xD;
escaped with only three years captivity, and some&#xD;
broken limbs, the benignant law above mentioned&#xD;
interposed to prevent farther punishment, and left&#xD;
the baron without any legal right to deprive Mons.&#xD;
du F- of his inheritance. His brothers being sen9&#xD;
sible of this, wrote to inform him of his father's&#xD;
death, and recall him to France. He refused tu go&#xD;
while the lettre de cachet remained in force against&#xD;
him. The baron having left all his papers sealed up,&#xD;
which his younger sons could not open but in the&#xD;
presence of their brother, they obtained the revoca-&#xD;
tion of the lettre de cachet, and sent it to Mons. dii&#xD;
F'-, who immediately set off for France.&#xD;
The baron's estate amounted to about four thou&#xD;
sand pounds a year. XVilling to avoid a tedious&#xD;
litigation with his brothers, Mons du F- consented&#xD;
to divide with them this property. But he soon&#xD;
found reason to repent of his imprudent generosity;&#xD;
those very brothers on whom he. had bestowed an&#xD;
equal share of his fortune, refusing to concur with&#xD;
him in his application to the parliament of Rouen for&#xD;
the revocation of the arret against his marriage.&#xD;
Mons. du F-, surprised and shocked at their refu-&#xD;
sal, began to entertain some apprehensions of his&#xD;
personal safety; and dreading, that supported by the&#xD;
authority of his mother, .another lettre de cachet&#xD;
might be obtained against him, he hastened back to&#xD;
England. Nor was it till after he had obtained as-&#xD;
Surances from several of the magistrates of Ronen&#xD;
that they would be responsible for the safety of his&#xD;
I)erson, that he azain ventured to return to France,&#xD;
acco ~panied by Madame and Mad amoiselle du F-.&#xD;
fl or(ler to obtain the revocation of the arret. On&#xD;
their arrival at     finding that the parliament&#xD;
was exiled,   that    business could not be prose~&#xD;
cuteil at that time, they again came back to pass&#xD;
the winter in England.&#xD;
At this l)eriod his mother died; an(l in the follow-&#xD;

France, at the great epocha of French liberty, on&#xD;
the 15th of July, 17S9, the very (lay after that on&#xD;
which the Bastile was taken. it was then that&#xD;
Mons. du F-.-- felt himself in security on his native&#xD;
shore-it was then that his domestic comforts were&#xD;
no longer embittered by the dread of, being torn&#xD;
from his family, by a separation more terrible than&#xD;
death itself-it was then that he no more feared&#xD;
that his repose at night would be broken by the en-&#xD;
trance of ruffians, prepared to drag him to dungeons,&#xD;
the darkness of which was never visited, by the&#xD;
blessed beams of day.&#xD;
Such is the history of Mons. dii F-. Has it not&#xD;
the air of a romance? and are you not glad that the&#xD;
denouement is happy ?--Does not the old baron die&#xD;
exactly in the right place; or at the very page one&#xD;
would choose ?-Or if I sometimes wished that he&#xD;
had lived a little longer, it is only from that desire of&#xD;
retribution, ixhich, in cases of injustice and oppres-&#xD;
sion, it is so natural to feel. It is only because the&#xD;
knowledge of the overthrow of the ancient govern&#xD;
ruent, would have been a sufficient punishment to&#xD;
'him for all his cruelty, lie would have sickened at&#xD;
the sight of general happiness. The idea of liberty&#xD;
being extended to the lower ranks, while at the same&#xD;
time, tyranny was deprived of its privileges, he&#xD;
would have found it insupportable, and would have&#xD;
abhorred a country which could no longer bokst of&#xD;
a Bastile; a country where iron cages were broken&#xD;
down, where dungeons were thrown open, and&#xD;
where justice was henceforth to shed a clear and&#xD;
steady light, without one dark shade of relief from&#xD;
letters de cachet.&#xD;
But peace be to his ashes! If the recollection of&#xD;
his evil deeds excites my indignation, it is far other-&#xD;
wise with Moos. or Madame du F-. Never did I&#xD;
hear their lips utter an expression of resentment O~&#xD;
disrespect towards his memory; and never did I&#xD;

&#xD;
A CANON of Compostello had long been puzzled&#xD;
to determine to what art or science he should apply&#xD;
himself in his mature years. Honours, wealth and&#xD;
affluence were the objects of his wishes; but a life&#xD;
of active exertion was not at all adapted to his taste.&#xD;
At length he decided in favour of magic. With&#xD;
the knowledge of this art, he conceive(l that, after&#xD;
some (lifliculties, which he would soon be enabled to&#xD;
surmount, subservient spirits would accomplish all&#xD;
his desires, without any efforts of his own. He im~&#xD;
mediately enquired for a skilful magician, and was&#xD;
recommended to a certain Don Rodriguez, at Tole-&#xD;
do, as the most eminent necromancer of the age.&#xD;
Without loss of time he set out for Toledo, went to&#xD;
DonL Rodriguez, and requested the favour of his&#xD;
instruction.&#xD;
The canon had figured to himself, a man with a&#xD;
magic girdle and long staff, a countenance fright-&#xD;
fully austere, and a beard a yard in length; but he&#xD;
found only a venerable and affable old man, resem-&#xD;
~j   blincr in dress and person, the rest of the sons of&#xD;
Ada~b. Having explained the nature of his errand,&#xD;
Don Rodriguez calmly replied :-" You are welcome&#xD;
to my house as my disciple and my son. The art to&#xD;
which you have resolved to devote yourself, is in-&#xD;
deed the most sublime of all; but it requires in him,&#xD;
who wishes to make himself thoroughly master of it,&#xD;
a pure heart. Have you this?" " I hope so."&#xD;
"I must take your word for it. The powers of&#xD;
nature are obedient to spirits, but there is only one&#xD;
being who knows the heart. I shall, in the next&#xD;
place ask you, whether you will be grateful to tue if I&#xD;

initiate you into the mysteries of wisdom?" " My&#xD;
life should be at your service."&#xD;
"I am not quite so exhorbitarit in my demands.&#xD;
But you know that you are canon of an ancient and&#xD;
distinguished cathedral; you cannot fail to obtain&#xD;
promotion to higher dignities: in this case, would&#xD;
you bear your instructor in grateful remembrance?"&#xD;
If you ask this question in earnest, what a&#xD;
worthless wretch you must consider me! From this&#xD;
hour all my property and influence shall be at youx&#xD;
command."&#xD;
The canon here added a multitude of protest&#xD;
tions, which seemed at length to con~rince the old&#xD;
man of his sincerity. He rose from his seat and&#xD;
called his cook: she came. "Keep two partridges&#xD;
in readiness," said he, "but do not put them on the&#xD;
spit till you receive further orders: and now, my&#xD;
dear son," continued he, turning to *the canon,&#xD;
"come along with me." At these words he con-&#xD;
ducted his new disciple into an apartment full of&#xD;
books and in instruments, and commcn~ed his in-&#xD;
structions.&#xD;
Scarcely had he begun, when two men, from&#xD;
Compostello, entered, and delivered a letter to the&#xD;
canon. It was from the bishop, his uncle, who had&#xD;
fallen sick. sinc~ his departure, requesting him to&#xD;
return with all possible despatch, if he wished to&#xD;
receive his last blessing. The nephew, who lament-&#xD;
ed the interruption of his lesson, much more than the&#xD;
illness of his uncle, thought that he might very well&#xD;
dispense with his benediction; he therefore excused&#xD;
himself, upon the plea of business of extreme import-&#xD;
ance, and the two messengers returned from their&#xD;
fruitless errand. Four day afterwards they came&#xD;
back, and a~ured him, that he must ~et out without&#xD;
(lelay, as his uncle was dead, and the chapter had&#xD;
elected him to fill the vacant episcopal chair.&#xD;
No sooner did Rodriguez hear this, than he en-&#xD;
treated his pupil to confer the canonry, which he&#xD;
had hitherto held,, on one of his sons. With a thou-&#xD;
&#xD;
SCHOOL OP MAGIC.&#xD;
sand excuses, the new bishop declined for this time&#xD;
j complying with his request: begged Don Rodriguez&#xD;
to permit him to appoint his brother to the vacant&#xD;
place, and proposed that he should remove with him&#xD;
to Compostello, and bring his Son to that city, pro-&#xD;
posing faithfully to provide handsomely for the&#xD;
young man on the first opportunity.&#xD;
The old man accepted the offer..-.-They set out,&#xD;
and had not long been at Compostello, when a mes-&#xD;
sage and bulls arrived from his holiness. The new&#xD;
bishop imagined that the latter related to his con-&#xD;
firmation in his new dignity, but what was his as-&#xD;
tonishment to find that the holy father, on account&#xD;
of his extraordinary merits, offered him the arch&#xD;
bishopric of Toloso, with, the liberty of appointing&#xD;
his successor. He was, to be sure, somewhat puz-&#xD;
zled to find out what were the extraordinary merits&#xD;
to which his holiness alluded, hut yet he thought he&#xD;
should be exceedingly to blame to refuse the offer&#xD;
on account of this ignorance. He therefore accept-&#xD;
ed it, and had scarcely done so, when Ro4riguez&#xD;
again appeared, and most humbly requested him to&#xD;
think of his son for the vacant bishopric.&#xD;
His disciple acknowledged that he had promised&#xD;
to provide for his son, but he assured him that pre-&#xD;
vious obligations imposed on him the necessity of&#xD;
giving this bishopric to a paternal uncle-" Come&#xD;
with me to Tolosa," continued he, "and 1 shall not&#xD;
there want opportunities of acquitting myself of my&#xD;
debt, with usury."&#xD;
The good old man was again satisfied; they went&#xD;
to Tolosa, where Don Rodriguez spared no pains to&#xD;
instruct the new bishop in his art. He made a&#xD;
great proficiency; all hearts were devoted to him;&#xD;
and in two years a new embassy arrived from Rome,&#xD;
Drinking a cardinal's hat, and likewise the permis..&#xD;
Slori to ti'ansfer the archbishopric to whomsoever he&#xD;
thought fit.&#xD;
Again Don Rodriguez appeared, and spoke with&#xD;
more confidence than on the two former occasions;&#xD;

he represented the patience with which I e had wait-&#xD;
ed, and the services he had in the mean time ren&#xD;
dered, appealing, at the same time, to the explicit&#xD;
promise he had received. His eminence seemed&#xD;
extremely embarrassed; he confessed the justice of&#xD;
the remonstrance of Don Rodriguez; but yet he had&#xD;
.one more maternal uncle left, whose urgent en-&#xD;
treaties, as well as the duty in general, of providing&#xD;
for his family, he could not resist-" But come with&#xD;
me to Rome," concluded he, " I shall certainly&#xD;
there find abundant means of testifying my grati-&#xD;
tude to your son."&#xD;
Again Rodriguez complied. The new cardinal&#xD;
e acquired at Rome universal respect. The Pope did&#xD;
nothing till he had asked his advice; but his holi-&#xD;
ness was attacked by a disease which proved mortal&#xD;
The conclave was assembled, the arts of Don Rodri-&#xD;
guez were successfully exerted, and with an unani-&#xD;
mity of which there was no precedent, the late ca-&#xD;
non of Compostello was elected the supreme head of&#xD;
Christendom.&#xD;
Scarce was the triple tiara placed, with due so-&#xD;
lemnity, UI)Ofl his head, when Don Rod ri~uez again&#xD;
appeared before him, repeated the request which he&#xD;
had already thrice preferred, and guessed, from the&#xD;
significant sh4ke of the head, as soon as he 1)egan to&#xD;
speak, that he would receive the same answer.-&#xD;
This ruffled the otherwise placid temper of the old&#xD;
man, who assured his holiness that lie was weary of&#xD;
these everlasting applications, and was determined&#xD;
to be no longer imposed upon by empty promises;&#xD;
that he well knew what he had deserved, and he&#xD;
should now expect the holy father to fulfil the pro-&#xD;
mise he had made at Toledo, or to give him a plump&#xD;
denial at once.&#xD;
This boldness exasperated the Pope-" Professor&#xD;
of the black art !" cried he, " I know too what yo~i&#xD;
have deserved-the scaffold. Begone fro ni my sight&#xD;
Too long have I shown indulgence to your tricks.&#xD;
If I find you in Rome to-morrow, I will deliver you&#xD;

to the holy inquisition, wl~ichThall bestow on you a&#xD;

At these words Don Rodriguez turned calmly&#xD;
round: "Cook," sahi he, opening the door, "you&#xD;
need only put down one partridge, for I shall sup&#xD;
alone."-The charm was instantly dissolved. His&#xD;
holiness was again transformed into the mere canon -&#xD;
of Compostello, and perceived that this long series&#xD;
of years, dignities, and events, haJ been the effect&#xD;
of the art of Don Rodriguez; and that he now stood&#xD;
tried and convicted of ingratitude, before a man&#xD;
who was much ~o wise to throw away his instruc-&#xD;
tions upon him.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CONJUGAL TRIO.&#xD;
&#xD;
A WOMkN in Pennsylvania, of middle age, fell sick,&#xD;
and was soon convinced that she had riot long to&#xD;
live. The tluughts of her young children gave her&#xD;
great uneasiness in these last moments of her life.&#xD;
She sent for her husband to her bed-side, and did&#xD;
not conceal from him the apprehensions she ent~r~&#xD;
tamed, lest her successor in the conjugal bed should&#xD;
ill-treat hei motherless infants; she begged and con-&#xD;
jured her husband, now that she was going to leave&#xD;
him, to marry the young and robust Rosina, who&#xD;
had always been a faithful servant to them both, and&#xD;
cheerfully performed whatever was required of her.&#xD;
The husband regarded this proposal of his sick&#xD;
wife, as the effect of impaired intellects, but as she&#xD;
f~ insisted that he should swear to fulfil her wishes, he,&#xD;
to please her, took an oath to that purpose. Two&#xD;
days afterwards, the patient, distrusting her hus.&#xD;
band's sincerity, called him and Rosina to her bed,&#xD;
and told the latter that she intended to unite her in&#xD;
marriage with the mali whom she herself was about&#xD;
to leave a widower; exhorting her, at the same time,&#xD;
to be faithful to him, to love him, and to take great&#xD;

The good-natured Rosina promised~ weeping, to do&#xD;
whatever she required. rhe sick woman united&#xD;
them herself, and made them both take the matri-&#xD;
monial vow, and obliged them immediately to put&#xD;
the seal to their new contract, to prevent the possi-&#xD;
bility of their receding.&#xD;
Having accomplished this business to her satisfac-&#xD;
tion, the patient gradually grew better: but the&#xD;
husband, in whose sight the new wife had found fa-&#xD;

since she had obliged him to marryli osinahe was&#xD;
determined not to forsake her as long as he lived.&#xD;
The former, so far from being displeased, was, on the&#xD;
contrary, highly delighted with this resolution, em-&#xD;
braced her husband, and by her caresses testified&#xD;
the warmest approbation. No misunderstanding&#xD;
was ever known to arise between these two wives.&#xD;
The second bore several children, ~o which the&#xD;
first showed as much tenderness as to her own, and&#xD;

BELPHAGOR.&#xD;
&#xD;
WE find, in the ancient records of Florence, that&#xD;
a most holy man, whose life was, in after years, cele..&#xD;
rated for sanctity, being one night deeply engaged&#xD;
in meditation, fell into a dream, and saw numbers&#xD;
of the souls of wretched mortals, who had \died un-&#xD;
der the displeasure of the gods, and inhabited the&#xD;
dark regions of Pluto, complaining, at least most&#xD;
part of them, of having been driven to such misery&#xD;
by marriage; the which greatly surprised Minos,&#xD;
Radamanthus, and other infernal judges, as they&#xD;
did not credit those falsehoods against the sex. But&#xD;
these complaints increasing daily, after informing&#xD;
Pluto of it, it was resolved to hold a council of all&#xD;
the infernal deities upon the subject, and ultimately&#xD;
determine upon what might be best to do, in order&#xD;
to ascertain the whole truth of the case. These&#xD;
being called to council, Pluto spoke in the following&#xD;
manner:-.--" Although, my dearly beloved, by celes..&#xD;
tial power and irrevocable fate, I possess this realm,&#xD;
and am wholly unaccountable to any celestial or&#xD;

mortal beng, yet as it is more wise to listen to th~&#xD;
opinions of others, I have resolved to tak~ your ad~&#xD;
vice, in a case that might eventually be of great (hs~&#xD;
honour to our empire. All the souls of' men that&#xD;
come into our infernal kingdom, say that their wives&#xD;
are the cause of it; this appearing impossible to us,&#xD;
we, therefore, fear tl~at in passing sentence on this&#xD;
subject , we may, perhaps, be accused of' too much&#xD;
cruelty, or of not being sufficiently severe, and tin-&#xD;
friendly to justice; being desirous to avoid both&#xD;
these charges, we have called upon you for tour ad-&#xD;
vice and assistance, in order that this realm may re-&#xD;
main, as it ever hath been, without disgrace." It&#xD;
appeared to all the infernal lords, that it was a most&#xD;
momentous case, apd they unanimou4y agreed that&#xD;
it ought to be sifted to the very bottombut disagreed&#xD;
about the means and manner of carrying the investi-&#xD;
gation into effect; some were of. opinion that one of&#xD;
them should be sent into the world, in the shape of a&#xD;
man, to ascertain personally the truth; others thought&#xD;
it mio~ht be (lone with less difficulty, by compelling&#xD;
several souls, by various torments, to tell the truth'&#xD;
but the majority decreeing that some one should be&#xD;
sent, they decided upon the former opinion. No one&#xD;
being inclined to take this business upon himself, it&#xD;
was settled that chance should determine; the which&#xD;
fell to the lot of the archdevii Belphagor, who, before&#xD;
he was kicked out of heaven, was called archangel;&#xD;
he, though against his will, was compelled, by Pluto's&#xD;
power, to accept the office, and prepared to do that&#xD;
which the council should determine, and bound hiur'.&#xD;
self to such compacts as had solemnly been stipulated&#xD;
between them' the which were, that he who should&#xD;
be deputed should immediately receive a hundred&#xD;
thousand ducats, with which he was to come into the&#xD;
world, with the features of man-.take to him a wife&#xD;

L.   should be subject to all the misfortunes, and all the&#xD;
evils incident to man-.-that of poverty, imprison'-&#xD;
inent, diseasess, and other calamities which men&#xD;
draw on themselves, unless he could extricate him-&#xD;
self from them by deceit or cunning. Belphagor,&#xD;
having assumed the man, and taken the cash, came&#xD;
to the world, and after having ordered his horses&#xD;
and atteAdants, he made cheerfully, towards Flo-&#xD;
rence; the which city he chose, in preference to&#xD;
any other, as the one where roguery and usury&#xD;
were most likely to thrive; and, lakingihe name of&#xD;
Roderigo, he hired a house in the Borgo d'Ogrissan-&#xD;
ti. In order that they might not enquirer who he&#xD;
was, he gave out that he had quitted Spain when&#xD;
very young, and going to Syria, had gained all his&#xD;
wealth at Ale ppo, and that his object in coming to&#xD;
to take a wife, as being a more civilized&#xD;
country, and more congenial to his feelings. Rode'.&#xD;
[taly was&#xD;
rigo was a very handsome man, about thirty, and&#xD;
being in a very few days known to possess immense&#xD;
riches, and it appearing that he was liberal and hu-&#xD;
mane, many noble citizens, who had plenty of&#xD;
daughters, an~1 a scarcity of money, made offers to&#xD;
him; out of the number, Roderigo selected a most&#xD;
beautiful young lady called Onesta, daughter of&#xD;
Amerigo Donati, who had three other daughters,&#xD;
almost marriageable, and three sons grown to man's&#xD;
estate. Although he was of a noble family, and&#xD;
greatly esteemed in Florence, yet, in consequence&#xD;
of a style of living suited to his rank, he was very&#xD;
poor.&#xD;
Roderigo's wedding was most splendid; nothing usu'.&#xD;
at on such occasions was 'forgotten or neglected. It&#xD;
having been decreed, before he left the dark regions,&#xD;
that he should be subject to all the passions of men, he&#xD;
soon took delight and pride in the pomp and vanities&#xD;
of the world, and the praises of men, the which cost&#xD;
him dear enough. Besides this, he had not been&#xD;

Ion g with his wife, before lie fell desperately in love&#xD;
wit hh er, and was wretched if she happened to look&#xD;
otherwise than cheerful, or was displeased at any&#xD;
thing. Madonna Onesta had not only brought&#xD;
youth and beauty to Roderigo, but such a share of&#xD;
pride, that he, who was a tolerable judge, thought&#xD;
the J)ride of Lucifer himself was a mere nothing to&#xD;
it; this greatly increased the very instant she l)C~~&#xD;
ceived how much her husband donated upon her, and&#xD;
~she thought she could rule him as she 1)leased, she&#xD;
cornman(led him imperiously, nor (lid she hesitate,&#xD;
if he denied her any thing, to abuse and maltreat&#xD;
him, the ~vh ich greatly annoyed him, yet the ties of&#xD;
matrimony, and the love he bore tier, made him en-&#xD;
dure all with patience. I make no mention of the&#xD;
very enormous expenses he was at, to l)lease her in&#xD;
new fashions, which naturally often vary in this our&#xD;
city, and which he was obliged to submit to for the&#xD;
sake of peace. He was compelled to help his father-&#xD;
zn-law, in portioning the other girls; then again, to&#xD;
be on good terms with her, he was compelled to&#xD;
equip one brother for the Levant, with clothes, &amp;amp;c.,&#xD;
and another to the west with silks; and, lastly, to&#xD;
open a gold-beater's shQp for the third, all of which&#xD;
consumed the best part of his fortune. Moreover,&#xD;
in the carnival time, and festival of St. John, when&#xD;
the whole city is nothing but feasting and revels,&#xD;
and when the noblemen treat each other with&#xD;
splendid entertainments, 'Madonna Onesta would&#xD;
not yield to any lady in splendour and show, but in-&#xD;
sisted that her. Roderigo should outdo them all in&#xD;
magnificence. Quietly did Roderigo bear all these&#xD;
things for the reasons above Inentiorle(l-peace and&#xD;
~quietness; nor would he have grudged the expense,&#xD;
though very annoying, nay, would have even borne&#xD;
more, could he but have had peace in the house; or&#xD;
could have waited quietly the moment of his ruin:&#xD;
but on the contrary, it was quite the reverse, for be-&#xD;
sides the ruinous e~xtravagance she led him into, her&#xD;
diabolical nature wearied him daily, nor was there&#xD;
100&#xD;
&#xD;
4'&#xD;
a servant in the house that could stay any tinxe.&#xD;
Roderigo, of course, suffered much in notbeing able&#xD;
to keep a single seri~ant that eoul(l take care of his&#xD;
property4 for the very (levils he had brought with&#xD;
him, under the shape of servants, rather chose to&#xD;
return to hell, among their native fire and smoke,&#xD;
than dwell in the world under her control. Rode..&#xD;
rigo, going on in this dreadful way, and having&#xD;
wasted all his property in the above manner, began&#xD;
to live on the hopes of remittances from the east and&#xD;
west, which he exI)eete(l to receive, hut being T)ut&#xD;
to shifts and having good credit still, he borrowed&#xD;
on promissory notes. At this juncture the intelli-&#xD;
gence arrived, from the east and west, that one of&#xD;
the Madonna Onesta's brothers had gambled away&#xD;
all Roderigo's property, and that the other, on his&#xD;
return with a ship laden with goods, uninsured, had&#xD;
been (lrowne(1, and the ship sunk. rfhe instant the&#xD;
news was ma(le known, the creditors assembled, and&#xD;
judging he was a ruined man, they being prevent-&#xD;
ed from making any demands, the notes ni';t being&#xD;
as yet du ~, agreed it was proper to keep a watchful&#xD;
*    eyeov er im, in order that he might not give them&#xD;
the slip. Roderigo, on the other hand, seeing his&#xD;
situation desperate, and thinking of the infernal law&#xD;
that bound him to this ~i~hlinarv world, determined&#xD;
to be off at any rate. He mounted his horse 'one&#xD;
*    morning, and living near the gate Alphrato, he rode&#xD;
through on his way. No sooner was his (leparture&#xD;
heard of, than the creditors were roused up to action,&#xD;
and applying to the magistrate, they flew with the&#xD;
police, and even the populace, after him. Roderigo&#xD;
was scarcely one mile oft; when he heard the outcry&#xD;
behind him. Conceiving the road was but an In-&#xD;
different protection, he thought that striking across&#xD;
the fields would be a far safer way; but, in so doing&#xD;
be found so many ditches in his road, the which&#xD;
are frequent in that part, that he alighted, left his&#xD;
horse, and ran on foot through fields covered with&#xD;
vines and reeds, with which that country abounds.&#xD;

lie arrived at Peretola, at the house of Matteo del&#xD;
Bricca, a labourer of Giovanni ~del Ben~e, and as&#xD;
chance would have it, found Matteo feeding the&#xD;
oxen. Roderigo begged of him to save him from&#xD;
the hands of his enemies, who, he said, pursue(l him&#xD;
to take him, and shut him UI) in goal to (lie; P"~-&#xD;
mising hirri a great reward, and adding, that he&#xD;
would enrich him, and would, before he left him,&#xD;
give him such proofs that he could no longer doubt;&#xD;
and should he not keep his word, he would allow&#xD;
him to deliver him up to his pursuers. Matteo,&#xD;
though but a labourer, was a man of spirit, and kind-&#xD;
hearted; and thinking he could lose nothing by&#xD;
protecting him, he promised so to do, an(l concealed&#xD;
him behind a dunghill, covered him with bomber&#xD;
and sticks, which he had brought for firewood. Ro-&#xD;
derigo had scarcely time to conceal himself properly&#xD;
before his pursuers reached the place, who, how-&#xD;
ever, could not obtain from Matteo an avowal that&#xD;
he had seen any such a one as they described.&#xD;
They, therefore, continued their way; being unsuc-&#xD;
cessful in their search, after two days pursuit, they&#xD;
returned back to Florence. When the bustle was&#xD;
over, Matteo took him out of his concealment.&#xD;
Rode rigo said to him, "Matteo, I am under the&#xD;
greatest obligations to you, and will reward you,&#xD;
and that thou mayest believe me, I will tell thee&#xD;
who I am:"-upon this, he related to him who he&#xD;
was, and the orders he received on going out of&#xD;
hell; his taking a wife; the eternal plague he had&#xD;
with her; and moreover, the means he should use to&#xD;
enrich him, which were these :-~when he should hear&#xD;
that there was a young woman possessed with the&#xD;
devil, to be quite assured that ii was he who was&#xD;
within her, and that he should not cast himself from&#xD;
her until he himself should come, by which means&#xD;
tie might get such payment from her friends as he&#xD;
might choose. I hus agreed, he disappeared.&#xD;
Very few days had elapsed, when it was report-&#xD;
ed in Florence, that a daughter of Anibrogio&#xD;
1o~&#xD;
&#xD;
.1'&#xD;
&#xD;
Amadeo, who had married Buonijuto Zebalduc~&#xD;
ci, was possessed by the (levil. rube friends, of'&#xD;
course, tried all the remedies usually recurred to in&#xD;
I'   such cases, such as placing the hea(1 of SailTt Zarobi&#xD;
on her head, and Saint John of Gualbeilo's cloak,&#xD;
which things were rendered of no avail by Roderigo~&#xD;
and to make it clear that the diseased had rca Ily&#xD;
and truly an evil spirit within her, he made her&#xD;
speak Latin, and hold a disputation on philosophy.&#xD;
She made public the sins of people, and particularly&#xD;
those of a monk, who ha(l kept a female, more than&#xD;
four years, under the dress of a young friar; which&#xD;
things people much marveled at. Messer Ambro-&#xD;
gio, however, was truly miserable, and had lost all&#xD;
hopes of a cure, when Mauco, having hear(l of the&#xD;
case, came to him, and told him that if he would&#xD;
give him five hundred forms, to purchase a little&#xD;
farm at Ponterolo, he 'would restore the lady to her&#xD;
perfect senses. Amhrogio accepted the offer, upon&#xD;
which Matteo, having ordered several masses to be&#xD;
said, and numerous mysterious ceremonies to be&#xD;
performed. in order the better to conceal the busi-&#xD;
ness, he accosted the lady, and whispering into her&#xD;
ear, said, "Itoderigo, ~ am now come to thee that&#xD;
thou mayest perform thy promise:" to which Rode-&#xD;
rigo answered, "'but this sum is not enough to make&#xD;
thee rich, therefore, as soon a's I depart from this, I&#xD;
will cast myself into the daughter of Charles, King&#xD;
of Naples, nor will I depart from her until thou&#xD;
contest to me. Thou wilt then make thy own de-&#xD;
mand to the king, and after this, never trouble me&#xD;
more." This sai(l, he came foi~th from the lady, to&#xD;
the great amazement and j~y of all present. It was&#xD;
but a few months after, that the news was spread&#xD;
through Italy, of the accident which had bet~IIen&#xD;
l(ing Charles' daughter. All the attempts of the&#xD;
monks proving ineffectual to relieved her, and the&#xD;
king having heard of Matteo, immediately des-&#xD;
patched a messenger to Florence to fetch him.&#xD;
Mateo arrived soon at Naples, and, after some art-&#xD;

ful~practices, removed the evil spirit from the huly;&#xD;
but before Roderigo quitted his hold, he said,&#xD;
"Matteo, thou seest 1 have kept my word with thee,&#xD;
in enriching thee; I there rove, am now under no obli-&#xD;
gations whatever to thee; do not thou ~ver attempt&#xD;
to appear before mebecause f might hereafler do thee&#xD;
much harm, instead of the good I have done thee."&#xD;
Matteo, returning to Florence very rich, for the&#xD;
king had given him fifty thousand ducats, thought of&#xD;
enjoying his wealth in comfort, unCOnsAOUS that&#xD;
Roderigo would ever (10 him any injury; but this&#xD;
hope was soon frustrated, by news arriving that the&#xD;
daughter of Louis the Seventh of France was&#xD;
possessed of the evil spirit; tlii~s quite upset the&#xD;
mind of Matteo, considering the power of that king,&#xD;
and coupling, withal, the threat of Roderigo, if ever&#xD;
he appeared before him. Meanwhile, Louis, un-&#xD;
able to find a cure for his daughter, and being told&#xD;
of Matter's power of exorcism, sent at first a mes-&#xD;
senger to request his attendance; but Matteo al-&#xD;
leging indisposition as an excuse, the king was&#xD;
obliged to apply to the government, who compelled&#xD;
Matter to obedience. In great grief and perturbation&#xD;
of mind did Matteo arrive at Paris; he told the king&#xD;
that certainly there were such things, by which he&#xD;
had ibrmerly cured persons possessed with the devil,&#xD;
but that was riot the case with all such, because&#xD;
there were some of so wicked a nature, that neither&#xD;
threats, exorcisms, or religious ceremonies could&#xD;
move them; yet he would certainly do his best; but,&#xD;
should his endeavours prove useless, he entreated&#xD;
his majesty to pardon him. The king, greatly di~&#xD;
appointed and incensed, replied, that if he did not&#xD;
cure his daughter, he should certainly be hanged.&#xD;
Matteo, of course, felt much alarmed at his ticklish&#xD;
situation; nevertheh~ss, summoning up I)i5 whole&#xD;
stock of~courage, he desired the lady might be call-&#xD;
ed in, and, with all humility, in a whisper, entreated&#xD;
Roderigo to take pity o&amp;amp;him, reminding him of&#xD;
what he had formerly done by him: to which Rode&#xD;

rigo answered~ "treacherous villain, hast thou the&#xD;
boldness to appear before me? dost thou forget I&#xD;
made thea the rich man thou art? I will now show&#xD;
thee and the world how I can bestow gifts, and be-&#xD;
reave mortals of them at my pleasure, and before&#xD;
thou qiuttest this place, I'll have thee gibbeted."&#xD;
Matter, conceiving he was lost, and seeing no other,&#xD;
means of escape, determined to try his fortune in&#xD;
another way; therefi)re, desiring the lady might be&#xD;
dismissed, he said to the king, " Sire, I have already&#xD;
told your majesty, that there are such malignant&#xD;
spirits, against which nothing will avail, and this is&#xD;
one; however, I will try one last experiment; which,&#xD;
should it succeed, will make your majesty and my-&#xD;
self' most happy; should it fail, I hope your majesty&#xD;
will feel that compassion towards me that my inno-&#xD;
cence deserves. To this effect, your majesty will&#xD;
please to order that a large platform be erected at&#xD;
the piazza of Our Lady, large enough to contain&#xD;
all your barons and clergy. (Jecking the railing with&#xD;
cloths, silks and gold fringes; in the middle of this&#xD;
platform I wish an altar to he place(I, and on Sun..&#xD;
day morning next I wish your majesty to attend, in&#xD;
solemn and royal pomp, with all your barons and&#xD;
clergy, in their richest canonicals, when high mass&#xD;
shall be chanted, and the lady brought forth. Be-&#xD;
sides these things, I do request that a group of at&#xD;
least twenty persons be placed at one corner of the&#xD;
square, with trumpets, horns, bugles, cymbals,&#xD;
drums, kettle-drums, and other terrific instruments,&#xD;
who, at the waving of my hat, shall immediately&#xD;
strike up and walk on towards the platform; this&#xD;
and certain other exorcisms will, [hope, drive the&#xD;
evil spirit from the lady." Every thing was order&#xD;
ed by his majesty which Matteo desired; on the&#xD;
Sunday morning, the king, barons, clergy, and&#xD;
populace being assembled, the mass was celebrated,&#xD;
and the lady brought up to the platform by two&#xD;
bishops, an(l several noblemen. Roderigo, when he&#xD;

most confounded: "what the devil does this das&#xD;
hardly scoundrel mean to do," said he to himself,&#xD;
"does he think to frighten me by all this show and&#xD;
bustle; does he not know that I am used to the&#xD;
pomp and splendour of heaven, and the fire and&#xD;
furies of hell? hut I will punish him, that 1 will."&#xD;
Matteo approached him, and entreated him to be&#xD;
gone. "What do y6u mean," said Rod~rigO, "do&#xD;
you think to terrify me by &amp;amp;ll these preparatiOI1S~&#xD;
dost thou think to shelter thyself from my power&#xD;
and the king's rage ? wretch! scoi~ndrCl that thou&#xD;

and at it they went, abusing each other, till at last&#xD;
Matter thought it would be useless to lose any more&#xD;
time, and gave the signal by waving his hat. All&#xD;
those that had been ordered, played up, and with an&#xD;
infernal noise approached the scaffold. RoderigO,&#xD;
at this horrid cry and noise, pricked up his ears,&#xD;
not kr~owing what it could be, and asked Mat-&#xD;
teo what all that meant. Mlatteo, seeming quite&#xD;
alarmed, said, "Oh Roderigo, it is your wife, it ~s&#xD;
your wift, that is coming to you!" At the hearing&#xD;
of his wife's name, no one would credit the agitation,&#xD;
fright, and terror it threw him into; and, without&#xD;
considering the improbability of its being so,,he was&#xD;
so thunder~5truck, that he instantly made off in a&#xD;
bustle, and left the lady free, preferring to go back&#xD;
to hell and give an account of his mission, to en-&#xD;
countering the vexations, spite, troubles, hardships,&#xD;
and dangers, to which the marriage yoke had sub-&#xD;
jecte'd him. Thus Belphagor returned to the infer-&#xD;
nal regions, gave a true and circumstantial account&#xD;
of all the evils which a wife brings into a house.&#xD;
And Matteo, highly delighted at his exploit, and at&#xD;
having outwitted the devil, returned home in rap-&#xD;
tures.&#xD;

STORY OF A STORK.&#xD;
&#xD;
A REMARKABLE STORY OF A STORK.&#xD;
SOME years ago, a tame stork was kept in the&#xD;
court-yard of the University of' Tubingen in Germa-&#xD;
ny. One day Count Victor Gravenitz, a student&#xD;
there, shot at a stork's nest adjacent to the college&#xD;
and probably wounded the stork then in it, as he&#xD;
was observed, for some weeks, not to Stir out of the&#xD;
nest. This happened in autumn ~&#xD;
Storks began their periodical ~ vhen foreign&#xD;
~ stork was emigrations. In the&#xD;
ensuing spring,~         observed on the roof of'&#xD;
the college, and, by its incessant chattering, gave&#xD;
the tame stork, walking below in the area, to under-&#xD;
stand, that it. would be glad of its company. But&#xD;
this Was a thing impracticable, on account of its&#xD;
wings being clipped; which induced the stranger,&#xD;
with the utmost precaution, first to come down to&#xD;
the upper gallery, the next day something lower,&#xD;
and at last, after a great deal of ceremony, quite in-&#xD;
to the court. The tame stork, which was conscious&#xD;
of no l~ arm, w'~nt to meet him, with a soft cheerful&#xD;
note, a~i d a sincere intention of giving him a friend&#xD;
ly reception; when, to his great surprise, the other&#xD;
fell upon him with the utmost fury. The spectators&#xD;
present, indeed, for that time, drove away the&#xD;
foreign stork; but this was so far from intimidating&#xD;
him, that he came again the next day to the charge,&#xD;
and during the whole summer, continual skirmishes&#xD;
were interchanged between them. Mr. G. R. V. F.&#xD;
had given orders that the tame stork should not be&#xD;
assisted, as having only a single antagonist to en-&#xD;
Counter: and, by being thus obliged to shift for him-&#xD;
self, he came to stand better on his guard, and made&#xD;
such a gallant defence, that at the end of the cam-&#xD;
paign, the stranger had no great advantage to boast&#xD;
of. But the next spring, instead of.a single stork,&#xD;
came four; which, without any of the foregoing&#xD;
ceremonies, alighted at once on the college area,&#xD;
and directly attacked the tame stork, who indeed, in&#xD;

he wished to sharpen my wits for executing any new&#xD;
project of his own, was no churl at his table; having&#xD;
dined at the house of a poor, but hearty friend, I&#xD;
refused my share of a bladebone of mutton, and ate&#xD;
very sparingly at tea-time, in order to avoid incomn-&#xD;
moding his craving family; or, rather, to indulge a&#xD;
little excess at night, at my master's more plentiful&#xD;
table: but, jutige of my mortification, after waiting&#xD;
at my bookseller's till half after eleven, he sent word&#xD;
to his wife, that, having attended a sale, he was de-&#xD;
tained to sup with the gentlemen of the trade, and&#xD;
would therefore be glad to see Mr. Readypen at his&#xD;
house on the following evening. But, to make the&#xD;
best of a bad bargain, meditating on my way upon&#xD;
the dignity of human nature, and the superlative&#xD;
excellence of the pleasures of the mind over sensual&#xD;
gratifications, and full of this sentimental truth, I&#xD;
overtook two young gentlemen, one of whom was&#xD;
describing to the other the delicious cntertainrnent&#xD;
of the day, and I could not forbear listening to the&#xD;
luscious description of the varieties he had tasted&#xD;
His fellow traveller assured him he had partaken of&#xD;
a treat by no means inferior. "I have," said he,&#xD;
and here he pulled out i~is handkerchief, which, I ob-&#xD;
served, aS it unrolled, dropped something on the&#xD;
ground. I. immediately hastened to pick it up, with&#xD;
an intention of returning it to the owner; but, when&#xD;
I took hold of the precious prize, it felt like the&#xD;
drumstick of a pullet. "0 propitious Fortune,"&#xD;
cried I; "nobly hast thou recompensed my former&#xD;
wants!" and was then going to devour the lucious&#xD;
morsel; but, upon recollecting that I had~ a dry crust&#xD;
in my garret, I hastened home with all celery, and&#xD;
an hundred times blessed the prudent forecast of my&#xD;
young b~au, who had, by his saving economy, pro-&#xD;
vided, in the midst of plenty, for a future occasion;&#xD;
and I made no doubt but that he had served his ap-&#xD;
prenticeship in the city, under the eye of some pro-&#xD;
vident citizen. "Glorious treats," said, Ito myself,&#xD;
"are those, where the pockets, as well as the stomach,&#xD;

of these thoughts, the very reverse of those&#xD;
which I had encouraged before the lucky minute of&#xD;
my seizing the drumstick, I entered my lodgings;&#xD;
and, though I had seven landing-places to encounter&#xD;
before I reached the top, yet I ascended with a joy-&#xD;
ful alacrity, and directly proceeded to search after&#xD;
my crust, intending to save, that night. the expense&#xD;
of candle and coals. But, alas! after an hour's fruit&#xD;
less search, the crust was yet hidden from my view.&#xD;
Being, therefore, obliged to strike a light, I could not&#xD;
help first making use of my candle in examining, by&#xD;
its splendour, the fortunate drumstick which I had&#xD;
picked up. I pulled it eut of my pocket with all the&#xD;
joy of a miser unloading his bags; but, oh reader!&#xD;
how wilt thou pity my condition when I tell thee&#xD;
what I saw! I saw not the drumstick that I hoped to&#xD;
have seen; I saw not either the leg, wing, breast,&#xD;
neck, of turkey, pullet, capon, chicken, fowl, duck,&#xD;
teal, goose, or gosling; but I saw the wretched thumb&#xD;
of some lilfeless mortal, whose body, I presume, had&#xD;
furnished the treat my provider had mentioned.&#xD;
Before I had well reflected on my greal and un-&#xD;
speakable loss (for I was not quite hungry enough&#xD;
to play the cannibal,) it came into my head that pos-&#xD;
sibly this thumb might belong to some poor author,&#xD;
who, like myself, was first reduced by the booksel-&#xD;
lers to a skeleton, and then sold by those severe task-&#xD;
masters to their brother liverymen, as an additional&#xD;
piece of furniture for Surgeons' Hall. However, I&#xD;
was much chagrined at finding 1 must go to bed with-&#xD;
out my meal: I did so, with as much composure as&#xD;
could be expected from a supperless philosopher.&#xD;
As I had nothing to suffer from indigestion, I was&#xD;
quickly relieved from my distresses by a sound slum-&#xD;
ber, which lasted till I was disturbed by a spectre,&#xD;
who, with pale hands, drew my curtain aside (that&#xD;

and commanded me to deliver himn his thumb.&#xD;
At his hasty summons I plucked up my courage,&#xD;
and'asked him who he was: " I am," replied the ap-&#xD;
parition, " an unfortunate man, who passed my days&#xD;
here on earth in great ease and tranquility."-" An&#xD;
unfortunate man !" cried I.-" Hear me," said the&#xD;
spectre, " and attend. At my death, my friends&#xD;
lamented, and kindly deposited me in the ground;&#xD;
hoping, most cordially, that I should soon rot, and&#xD;
never trouble them more. But, although the Fates&#xD;
suffered me to live peaceably, yet they resolved to&#xD;
make me pay for my quietness after death, and there-&#xD;
fore determined that 1, who was too lazy to undergo&#xD;
any adventures while living, should experience a&#xD;
variety of hardships' after my decease. It pleases&#xD;
me, 0 Readypen, that by means of that thumb, which&#xD;
you rescuedl from the surgeon's clutches, we should&#xD;
'become acquainted, because I am desirous that man-&#xD;
kind should1 be acqainted with the History of my&#xD;
Death and Adventures. And whom could I find&#xD;
more able and proper to undertake the part of an&#xD;

ate state between life and death; not dead enough&#xD;
to be buried and anatomized, nor sufficiently alive&#xD;
to be known or regarded ? Take courage, then.; for&#xD;
although I have cheated you of one meal, by the loss&#xD;
of your drumstick, I intend giving you a week's bread&#xD;
*  and beer, by furnishing a paper or two on the numer-&#xD;
ous misfortunes and accidents that I have sustained,&#xD;

My spectre having thus introduced himself, begged&#xD;
leave to sit down and tie on his thumb: " Sir," said&#xD;
the dead man; " but I hope I have not tied my thumb&#xD;
too tight. Have you no ribbon, Mr. Readypen, in&#xD;

in laying me out. Whether the old searcher had at-&#xD;
tended any anatomical lectures, or whether she had&#xD;
gain.ed her knowledge from frequent observation, I&#xD;
will not pretend to say, but certainly she passed a&#xD;
very curious and exact judgment upon every limb&#xD;

"The searcher was now desirous to cover my body,&#xD;
but the nurse objected. However, after a quarter&#xD;
of an hour's meditation, Mrs. Nurse suffered me to&#xD;
be covered u~; and having dismissed the searcher,&#xD;
went immediately in quest of the barber.&#xD;
"The barber, not liking the office of lathering&#xD;
/ the beard of a dead citizen (as I presume, he thought&#xD;
he should have no opportunity of displaying his news&#xD;
or his oratory,) sent his apprentice, a lad about&#xD;
elven years old. The boy was ordered into my room&#xD;
to shave me, without being told 'that little and insig~&#xD;
nificant circumstance of my death. When he came,&#xD;
he began scraping and bowing, and hoped my Hon-&#xD;
our was better. To this finding no answer return-&#xD;
ed, he descended on tiptoe down stairs, and told the&#xD;
nurse the gentleman was asleep. 'Asleep, you fool'!'&#xD;
replied she; 'why, Mr. Finch has been dead these&#xD;
ten hours; and we want to have him shaved before&#xD;
th~ shrewd is put on, that he may look decent and&#xD;
clean.'&#xD;
"Having had this account, the boy was very un-&#xD;
willing to return; and when he was at length i'm-&#xD;
vailed upon to begin his job, his little hands shook so&#xD;
much, that you may see he has nearly cut my nose&#xD;
off in the operation.&#xD;
"Well, Sir, I will not trouble you with a long ac-&#xD;
count of the shroud, or the undertaker's behaviour&#xD;
thereupon, nor insist any time on the cheats which I&#xD;
was forced to behold, and was not able to redress;&#xD;
how the undertaker charged double the quantity of&#xD;
woolen that was used, to the great detriment of our&#xD;
staple trade; how he inclosed me in a coffin made of&#xD;
feather-edge boards, whose top app~earcd thick and&#xD;
substantial, and whose bottom would hardly keep out&#xD;
the sunshine from my limbs while I lay on the tres-&#xD;
sels in the chamber.&#xD;
"I shall also pass over the grief of my niece, which&#xD;
was so little, that I should have done her no injustice,&#xD;

&#xD;
THE DEAD ALDERMAN.&#xD;
if I had entirely forgotten to mention it; the number&#xD;
of drains the nurse and her helpmate required to&#xD;
keep up their spirits during their nocturnal watches&#xD;
over the dead corpse, and the curious conversations&#xD;
which they held on ghosts, death-watches, appa-&#xD;
ritions, and the place set apart for the dead. Be it&#xD;
sflfficient to say, that the second night after my de-~&#xD;
cease, I was, by the undertaker, screwed up in the&#xD;
coffin, placed in an elegant hearse, and attended by&#xD;
near a dozen cousins, who all lamented the very un-&#xD;
just will of their kinsman, who had wickedly left all&#xD;
his fortune to one favourite niece.&#xD;
"As soon as my corpse arrived in the hearse at the&#xD;
churchyard gates, I was drawn forth like a large&#xD;
applepuff, and conveyed on the shoulders of six men;&#xD;
the two foremost of whom called me a great thick-&#xD;
headed rascal, and swore I had as much lead on my&#xD;
'scull as a church steeple. 'Zo-ds-,' cried one of the&#xD;
middlemost, 'you need not complain, for all the&#xD;
weight is in his belly; I warrant he died of a dropsy.&#xD;
Why, there's as much water in him now as there is&#xD;
at the New River Head.' 'While this curious conver-&#xD;
sation was passing under me, the undertaken and&#xD;
curate were as busily employed at the head of the&#xD;
procession.&#xD;
"'Zo-ds,' said Mr. Gumall, as he beheld the cu-&#xD;
rate hastening across the churchyard to meet the&#xD;
corpse, 'these idle clergy always make us wait:&#xD;
there's no such thing as burying a man decently&#xD;
while they are concerned: and, then, the shabby fel-&#xD;
lows do but disgrace the procession when they come.&#xD;
Anything of a gentleman would be ashamed of wear~&#xD;
ing such rusty garments.'&#xD;
"As he spoke these words, the curate came up;&#xD;
whereupon Mr. Gumall addressed him as follows:-.&#xD;
"'What, Sir, do you mean by making me wait in&#xD;
this manner? Who the d-l, Sir, do you take me&#xD;
for? I'd have you to know, Sir, that I am your su-&#xD;
perior, Sir. I pay scot and lot, Sir; I pay to the&#xD;
poor's rate, Sir; and I'll be used like a gentleman~&#xD;

Sir; and expect to have my work done in time, when&#xD;

to make a genTleman wait in this manner. 'Tis a&#xD;
burning shame that poor dead gentlemen, God rest&#xD;
their souls! can't go quietly to their graves, but&#xD;
must be stopped by the pride and negligence of the&#xD;
clergy. ,But the most insignificant will always make&#xD;
the most trouble.' .&#xD;
"'Great Sir,' answered the curate, 'be pleased&#xD;
to stop the volubility of your tongue. I am not come&#xD;
here to do* the work of an undertaker, or to mix in&#xD;
the farce of woe, which you and your hirelings hang&#xD;
out: my business is to do the work of Hin that sent&#xD;
me, which I desire to .perform with the solemnity&#xD;
that becomes my function. I stand here, good ISir,&#xD;
to recommend your infirmities to the pardon of Hea-&#xD;

you: therefore be so good as to attend with decency&#xD;
and silence.' H aving thus said, the grave curate be-&#xD;
gan' the service with humility, imploring the Crea-&#xD;
tor's mercy and assistance-.&#xD;
" The service being concluded, and the earth&#xD;
thrown on iyny coffin by the sexton, I was left, of&#xD;
course, to the worms and the earth, where I continu-&#xD;
ed unmolested till night; when I heard a great strug~-&#xD;
gle without the coffin between a worm and a beetle,&#xD;
which should first get at my precious flesh. 'The&#xD;
beetle went very awkwardly to work; but the worm,&#xD;
having before examined the structure of Mr. Gum-&#xD;
all's coffin, struck at the feather-edge, and got pos-&#xD;

"0,- Mr. Readypen, can you conceive the tortures&#xD;

fend myself even from a worm who came rolling&#xD;
over my body, and, having reached my face, he be-&#xD;

ing salts, suffocated the rascal, before he could wrig-&#xD;
ge himself backward out of the hole he had made.&#xD;
"I now began to wish for the use of my bands,&#xD;
that I might remove the wretch from my nose; but,&#xD;
that being impossible, I comforted myself with the re-&#xD;
flection, that many fine ladies were in as bad a plight,&#xD;
for the best tweezers in the world can never entire-&#xD;
ly rid a lady of, her animalcula, which will remain&#xD;
immoveable in spite of the joint efforts of maid or&#xD;

'4 But these were small evils. At twelve I heard&#xD;
the mattock and spade busily employed over my&#xD;
head, and could distinguish several voices above.&#xD;
At length, by the light of a lantern, .I beheld (for I&#xD;
could see, though dead, as well as hear) a little dap-&#xD;

brought to his dwelling, I received every kind of as-&#xD;
sistance that my case required, though I could not&#xD;
help reading a strong disgust against heretics in the&#xD;
countenance of my hostess; and I really believe, if&#xD;
her husband had been as bigoted as herself, instead&#xD;
of prosecuting my jo.iirney, I should have been sent&#xD;
to my grave. Suffice it to say, that, in the intervals&#xD;
of my disorder, I contracted an intimacy with my&#xD;
host, nearly allied to friendship: we talked upon dif-&#xD;
ferent subjects, and sometimes upon religion. I was&#xD;
astonished that a man, so reasonable in other re-&#xD;
spects, should be so strongly attached(to some of the&#xD;
grossest superstitions of the Romish church; though&#xD;
at that time I thought it prudent to seem satisfied&#xD;
with the reasons he urged for his condud; but as a&#xD;
saint's day occurred soon after, I learned, to my&#xD;
great surprise, that my host was not only a good&#xD;
Catholic in theory, but in practice; and that in con-&#xD;
formity with the unnatural doctrines of austerities,&#xD;
usually practiced upon these occasions, he meant to&#xD;
exercise the practice of flagellation upon himself&#xD;
What indignation did I then feel against priests and&#xD;
monks! but, as arguments would have been useless,&#xD;
I hit upon the following contrivance: taking an op-&#xD;
portunity to watch his cominginto my chamber, and&#xD;
when no other person should be present but our-&#xD;
selves, I stripped to my shirt, and took a rope, and&#xD;
began to discipline myself pretty smartly; my host,&#xD;
as I conjectured, with much surprise, asked me&#xD;
what I was doing? I replied, "You have laid me&#xD;
under so many obligations, that, having no other&#xD;
means to convince you of m~ gratitude, I have taken&#xD;
this method merely to give you satisfaction " "My&#xD;
dear friend," exclaimed my host, "is it possibIe~ you&#xD;
can believe that you afford me any satisfaction by&#xD;
putting yourself in pain?" I answered, "in so do-&#xD;
ing, I am only imitating your own example in the&#xD;
means you took to please the Almighty!" He at-&#xD;

&#xD;
ST. EVONA,'a lawyer of Britain, went to Rome,&#xD;
to entreat the Pope to give the lawyers of that coun-&#xD;
try a patron, to which the Pope replied, that he&#xD;
knew of no Saint, but what was disposed of to other&#xD;
professions. At this Evona was very sad, and ear-&#xD;
nestly begged the Pope to think of them. At last&#xD;
his holiness proposed to St. Evona, that he should go&#xD;
round the church of San Giovanni di Latei-ano&#xD;
blindfold,and after he should have said a certain num-&#xD;
ber of Ave Marias, that the first saint he should lay&#xD;
hold of should be his patron. This the good old&#xD;
lawyer willingly undertook, and at the end of his&#xD;
Ave Marias, stopped at St. Michael's altar, where&#xD;
he laid hold of the Devil, under St. Michael's feet,&#xD;
and cried out, " this is our Saint, let him be our&#xD;
Patron.'' Being unblinded, and seeing what a patron&#xD;
he had chosen, he went to his lodgings so dejected,&#xD;
that a few months after he died. II1s reputation for&#xD;
honesty was, however so great, that a witty. Frenck..&#xD;
nmxn wrote upon his tomb at Rome, " St. Evona un&#xD;

IN the year 1773, when a fierce and bloody war&#xD;
was carried on between Russia and Turkey, a&#xD;
young gentleman of good fairly, who resided in&#xD;
Petersburgh., of the name of Schemidt, had obtain-&#xD;
ed a commission from his government, and was&#xD;
shortly after ordered to join his regiment, which&#xD;
was in active service on the frontiers of 'Iurkey.&#xD;
Prior to setting out, he was ordered to take charge&#xD;
of a number of recruits, and to march them to bead&#xD;
quarters; they had been some days on their route,&#xD;
when passing near a small village, not far from their&#xD;
.destination, and at the extreme end, under a large&#xD;
oak, near the road side, was a small Lut, in which&#xD;
dwelt an old woman, who was a reputd Sorceress,&#xD;
or Sybil; and seemed to be well known to one of the&#xD;
party. -The recruits, who had received part of&#xD;
their bounty, each was resolved to have his fortune&#xD;
,told, -and prepared a small piece of silver accordl-&#xD;
ingly. The Sybil made each show his hand, and&#xD;
looking earnestly in the face, and examining his&#xD;
person with a scrutinizing eye, told every man&#xD;
something extraordinary that had happened to him,&#xD;
as well as his future destiny. J [hen all who had&#xD;
paid were satisfied, and about to depart, she beck&#xD;
oned Lieutenant Schemidt to approach, (he had&#xD;
remained near her out of curiosity, witnessing the&#xD;
credulity of the recruits,) he laughed at her, and&#xD;
damned her for an old .b-, did she think he had&#xD;
any faith in her incantations.--" 'Well," said she,&#xD;

of the recruits, each imparting to the other, the&#xD;
witches prediction. It certainly did recall to his&#xD;
own recollection, "The Ides of March," yet he&#xD;
treated the whole as a fable.&#xD;
He arrived at head-quarters, presented his cre-&#xD;
dentials, and. was~vell received. Almost immedi-&#xD;
ately after, the warfare between the Russians and&#xD;
Turks assumed a desperate aspect; quarter, to the&#xD;
vanquished, was refused to be given or taken by&#xD;
either party; the Turkish cavalry were well known&#xD;
to receive a handsome rew~.rd from their govern-&#xD;
ment, for the number of Russian heads each man&#xD;
brought into their camp; so that universally, when-&#xD;
ever the Turks gained any advantage, they always&#xD;
decapitated all those that fell on the field of battle,&#xD;
or otherwise came into their hands; and in like&#xD;
manner, the Russians put to death all Turks that&#xD;
came within their power, in the most cruel manner;&#xD;
many valuable officers were cut off, and no man&#xD;
was sure of his life a moment. The regiment Lieu-&#xD;
tenant Schemidt was in, happened to be peculiarly&#xD;
unfortunate, in losing a number of officers, and as&#xD;
each was promoted by seniority, before four months&#xD;
had elapsed, as predicted by the Sybil, he was pro-&#xD;
nioted to the command of a~ troop. Shortly after&#xD;
his promotion, on walking down the lines of the&#xD;
122&#xD;
&#xD;
camp alone, at the door of a settler's booth, he was&#xD;
accosted by an old healthy looking woman, saying,&#xD;
"Well captain, has not part of my prediction prov-.&#xD;
ed true ?" he instantly recognized the Sybil, whom&#xD;
he had seen at the village of N-, when about to&#xD;
join his regiment.-" Ha! old witch, what the devil&#xD;
brought you here?" said he; she answered, that not&#xD;
being able to obtain a living by telling fortunes, she&#xD;
had commenced suttler, and now followed the camp,&#xD;
and sold small wines and provisions to the troops.&#xD;
"Well," said he, "I dont forget the Ides of.Mareh;&#xD;
but I will yet bet a hamper of the best Tokay in&#xD;
Turkey, that that part of your prediction will be~&#xD;
untrue, and that you will appear, in the eyes of all&#xD;
men an impostor." This' speech seemed to rouse&#xD;
the old woman's scholar, her eyes flashed fire, her&#xD;
frame became agitated, she said, "I take you at&#xD;
your word, captain, and will make a deposit of the&#xD;
amount in your Colonel's hands, and I will take&#xD;
your word, as a man of honour, to the fulfilment on&#xD;
your part. If you are alive on the 14th of March&#xD;
next, 1 will pay you my hamper; if you arc not,&#xD;
your executors shall pay me a like complement."&#xD;
It was immediately agreed upon, and he departed.&#xD;
On his return to head quarters, he met his Colonel,&#xD;
who imparted to him that an old woman, a well&#xD;
known suttler of the camp, had lodged a certain de-&#xD;
posite in his hands, which she said was a bet pend-&#xD;
ing between him and her, and which was to be de-&#xD;
cided on the 14th of March next, yet two months&#xD;
distant. The captain was confused, told the Colo-&#xD;
nel the facts, at ~vhich they both laughed heartily, yet&#xD;
Captain Schemidt, as he afterwards acknowledged,&#xD;
could not banish the Ides of .March altogether from his&#xD;
memory. The time passed quickly on, the ~3th of&#xD;
March arrived, all was peculiarly quiet, no general&#xD;
engagement was expected, the two armies were in&#xD;
cantonments, waiting the approaching opening sea&#xD;
son, to commence hostilities; a strong picket guard&#xD;
was mounted every night, and frequent skirmishes&#xD;

bodies.&#xD;
The officers of Captain Schemidt's regiment were&#xD;
sitting, after dinner, over the bottle, and the Colonel&#xD;
mentioned the oddity of the wager, all joined&#xD;
heartily in the laugh against the captain, at the sin-&#xD;
gularity of the affair, when the Adjutant of the day&#xD;
entered the tent, and apprised the officer of the&#xD;
night, Captain B-, that his picket guard was&#xD;
ready; Captain Schemidt rested easy, for he was&#xD;
the third from whose turn it was to mount for that&#xD;
night, Captain B- went out, they resumed their&#xD;
conversation, and in less than a quarter of an hour,&#xD;
the Adjutant returned, and said the next officer&#xD;
must turn out, that Captain B- had been taken&#xD;
violently ill, and was carried to his tent, all looked&#xD;
grave, the next captain in rotation turned out: few&#xD;
wordIs escaped the company for some time, the Co-&#xD;
sonel pushed round. the bottle, and all was as usual-&#xD;
a few moments more elapsed, when the Adjutant a&#xD;
third time entered with a grave countenance, apolo-&#xD;
gising for being obliged to disturb them so often;&#xD;
but an accident of a serious nature had happened&#xD;
to Captain C-, that on mounting his horse, (which&#xD;
was rather fiery,) he had plunged and kicked in&#xD;
such a manner that he threw his rider, and broke&#xD;
his right arm, and he was now in the hands of the&#xD;
surgeon. It was now Captain Schemidt's- turn, he&#xD;
bounced up, the Colonel and officers rose also; the&#xD;
Colonel said: -" Schemidt, this looks serious." A&#xD;
.Captain, a friend of his, came forward, and volun-&#xD;
teered to take the guard,.which he would by no&#xD;
means admit of; he mounted, examined the men,&#xD;
who were chosen and tried veterans, and consisted&#xD;
of two Lieutenants and one hundred men, of which&#xD;
he had the command. They marched off to their des-&#xD;
tination, the out-post, which was two miles in ad-&#xD;
vance from the camp, and the only pass where the&#xD;
enemy could attack their line. Captain Schemidt&#xD;
was resolved to .be particularly on the alert the&#xD;

C&#xD;
&#xD;
whole night; the country being unknown to him, he&#xD;
placed centries at short distances, to keep up a corn&#xD;
munication. The night was exce-eding dark, he&#xD;
kept his men in close column and in constant mo-&#xD;
tion, with sabres drawn, till after two o'clock; all&#xD;
was silent as death, they had been six hours on&#xD;
horseback: they halted for a few minutes, and&#xD;
-alighted to give them a little corn, and had the bri-&#xD;
dies slipped back. on their necks; when suddenly,&#xD;
as' like a rushing mighty wind, they heard the&#xD;
trampling of horses, between them and -their own&#xD;
camp, each ran to, rebridle, but before they could&#xD;
reach their horses, they heard the cry of Alla! Alla!&#xD;
Alla! and an overpowering body of Turks, dashed&#xD;
into the very centre of their handful of men, in&#xD;
comparison, and each felt his horse fall either over&#xD;
him, or by his side, and himself cut down, before he&#xD;
was able to stand on the defensive. In short 500&#xD;
chosen Turks had been selected for this service, and&#xD;
had concealed themselves in a ravine, a few&#xD;
minutes before the arrival of the Russian picket-&#xD;
guard, within the -pass, a place where they could&#xD;
scarcely be suspected; they proceeded with so much&#xD;
caution and secrecy, that they never fired a shot,&#xD;
lest they might create an- alarm in the camp, and&#xD;
with the greatest exactness surprised and cut down&#xD;
all the centries. Captain Schemidt was in the cen-&#xD;
tre, and had succeeded in rebridling his horse, and&#xD;
his foot in the stirrup. about to remount, when a&#xD;
dagger was plunged, quick as lightning, into its op-&#xD;
posite side, and it immediately fell, and threw him&#xD;
to the ground, with his foot entangled in the stirrup.&#xD;
The weight of the dead horse gave him excruciating&#xD;
pain, so that he was near fainting. In two or three&#xD;
minutes all was again silent, save the groans of the&#xD;
dying men and horses, which were soon silenced,&#xD;
effectually, by the Turks' daggers; he thought to&#xD;
-remain in this position, as did some others who were&#xD;
but slightly wounded, till the Turks should ride off;&#xD;

inctly perceive, that a close line of the enemy, had&#xD;
been formed round their now prostrate party, and&#xD;
they proceeded immediately, to rifle and decapitate&#xD;
every single man of the Russians, and for which&#xD;
purpose, each Turk was provided with a sharp&#xD;
knife, and a bag to put as many heads in as he could&#xD;
sever from the bodies, and to do them justice, they&#xD;
could operate in that way with astonishing facility&#xD;
They had commenced from the outer, and were ap-&#xD;
proaching fast to the centre, where Captain Sche-&#xD;
midt lay. He now thought all was over with him,&#xD;
yet still he felt most anxious to live, and made one&#xD;
great effort, with his disengaged foot, to move the&#xD;
dead horse off the other, which he miraculously suc-&#xD;
ceeded in his sabre was drawn in his hand: a Turk&#xD;
who was particularly industrious in penetrating to&#xD;
the centre, and already had a tolerable bag full of&#xD;
heads, had actually laid his bloody hand on the Cap-&#xD;
tain's, with his great knife in the other; the Captain&#xD;
watched his opportunity, and before he could apply&#xD;
the knife, he ran him tl~rough the body; he encoun-&#xD;
tered another Turk, whom he also cut down, and&#xD;
springing forward, in a state of desperation, over-&#xD;
threw every obstacle, and cut his way through the&#xD;
cordon. The cry of "an escape!" sounded in&#xD;
every quarter; the night, as we before mentioned,&#xD;
was exceeding dark, and a number must have joined&#xD;
in the pursuit. The Captain darted forward, and&#xD;
was suddenly precipitated down a precipice; he&#xD;
caught some loQse earth or brambles, in his descent,&#xD;
which broke his falL Three of his1enemies also de-&#xD;
scended, two he thinks were killed in the fall, and&#xD;
the third was severely bruised. I1'e lost his sword in&#xD;
the scramble, but, with a few loose stones, he soon&#xD;
settled his adversary, which descended with him;&#xD;
but then he heard a number of voices coming round,&#xD;
he darted forward in an opposite direction, not&#xD;
knowing whether, having now no weapon to defend&#xD;
himself; he had not gone more than a f~w hundred&#xD;
paces, when he found himself entangled in a mo-&#xD;

he could now distinctly hear voices in every direc-&#xD;
tion, arid some very near him; at length th"ey died&#xD;
away; he could, from his own l)osltlon, perceive n~&#xD;

that he with the greatest difficulty could move a&#xD;

tri' e(l to scramble into less deep water. He was&#xD;
still fearful of leaving the morass till daylight, as he&#xD;

Turk who should bring in the head of the command-&#xD;

moistened by the tear of&#xD;
sensibility, when a robust tall Ottoman dragoon,&#xD;
rushed upon him, with his sabre drawn, to cut him&#xD;
down. ~Veak and faint as he must have been, after&#xD;
such a night, he looked round him f~r some means&#xD;

cut the dragoon down. The variety of' emotions&#xD;
which crowded on his mind, at this critical period,&#xD;
ore rpowere(l him, and he sunk into a swoon, from&#xD;
which he did not recover for a considerable time,&#xD;
insomuch that he was thought to be no more. He&#xD;
was immediately carried on a litter to the camp, and&#xD;
in a few moments the whole army was out to wit&#xD;
ness the sad catastrophe; yet there was no one per~&#xD;
son alive but Captain Schemidt, who could tell the&#xD;
story among all the Russians. On recovering from&#xD;
his swoon he became delirious, a high fever ensued,&#xD;
and for more than six weeks his life was despaired&#xD;
of; but peculiar care was taken of him, that some&#xD;
light might be thrown on this extraordinary busi-&#xD;
ness. He lay in the hospital for near fifteen weeks&#xD;
before he was able to be moved, he was then order-&#xD;
ed to his native air, and was six months before he&#xD;
was again able to join his regiment.&#xD;
'rhe adventure became generally known at Pe~&#xD;
tersbur~h and he was often, (as soon as he was&#xD;
able,) sent for to the court by Catharine, who used to&#xD;
make him recite the particulars, and as a reward&#xD;
for his sufferings, as ivell as his courage on the occa-&#xD;
sion, she created him Knight of the Golden Eagle,&#xD;
with a handsome pension, and a promise of promo-&#xD;
tion in her army, which shortly after took plade in&#xD;
his own regiment. He soon set out to resume the&#xD;
command, and was heartily welcomed by all the&#xD;
officers. One day when in company with some of&#xD;
his friends, the conversation turned on the Ides of&#xD;
March and the Sybil, who had gained considerable&#xD;
celebrity, as well as great gain by the affair; he was&#xD;
resolved to go, and through joke, demand fro~ her&#xD;
the before mentioned wager. On his approach l~, she&#xD;
recognized him, and said, "Well, Captain, d~ yoti&#xD;
now despise my power, do you still think I cannot&#xD;
divine into future events: you have miraculously&#xD;
escaped, that I could not foresee, but has not all the&#xD;
rest been fulfilled." "Yes, mother," said he4 "but&#xD;
where is my hamper of Tokay?" "That you shall&#xD;
1~s&#xD;
&#xD;
have," said she, "and the finest flavour too in all&#xD;
the Ottoman dominions."&#xD;
They departed, still doubting; but after dinner the&#xD;
1'okay was introduced as coming from the old&#xD;
witch; and never before had the very best judges&#xD;
of that rare, delicious, and valuable wine, ever tast-&#xD;
ed any so good. This led to some remarks on her&#xD;
conduct-of the abundance~of cash she was always&#xD;
supplied with-her occasional absence from the&#xD;
camp-and her complete control over the soldiery.&#xD;
All these remarks Captain Schemidt pondered in his&#xD;
mind, and was resolved to watch her closely. He&#xD;
found out she had in her particular confidence, the&#xD;
orderly serjeant, who was in attendance on the ge-&#xD;
neral commandant, on the fatal night of the 13th&#xD;
of March.&#xD;
lie remarked, that during her occasional absence&#xD;
from the camp, some advantages were usually gain-&#xD;
ed over the Russians. After one of these rencoun-&#xD;
ters, Captain Schemidt communicated his observa-&#xD;
tions to the general, who listened to them with at-&#xD;
tention. It was resolved to secure the serjeant, and&#xD;
to minutely search the place she occupied. This&#xD;
being accomplished, he was put to the torture. He&#xD;
confessed that this woman had bribed him, to give&#xD;
information to the enemy, respecting the different&#xD;
manouvres of the Russians on that Jay, and that she&#xD;
had a number of others as confederates within the&#xD;
camp-that she was a constant spy, and brought in-&#xD;
telligence, and was well paid, by the Turkish gene-&#xD;
ral, for any advantage they gained;-.that she wa0s&#xD;
now plotting something new in the Ottoman camp,&#xD;
and would return in a few days.&#xD;
Immediately on her arrival, she was arrested and&#xD;
put to the torture, when she confessed all. Captain&#xD;
$chemidt interrogated her as to himself; she ~id, it&#xD;
was she who planned the attack and ambuscade of&#xD;

DESCRIPTION OF AN IRISH WAKE.&#xD;
&#xD;
PADDY O'Connor, who was lately hanged at Tyburr&#xD;
for a footpad robbery, was descended from1an ancient&#xD;
family in the kingdom of Ireland, and ~*s he was a&#xD;
worthy person whilst living, his generous countrymen&#xD;
were determined to pay the highest honours to the re~&#xD;
mains of the deceased. Donnol O'Neale, who was&#xD;
the most particular friend of the late Paddy, now&#xD;
summoned all his acquaintance upon this mournful&#xD;
occasion; he very obligingly introduced them into a&#xD;
cellar not very far from St. Giles'. When they had&#xD;
descended about a dozen steps or so, they found&#xD;
themselves in a subteraneous region, but fortunately&#xD;
not uninhabited. On the right hand sat three old&#xD;
bawds drinking whiskey, smoking' tobacco out of&#xD;
two-inched pipes (by which means I believe their&#xD;
noses were red,) and swearing and blasting between&#xD;
every puff. One of the visitors was immediately sa-&#xD;
lUtC(l b~y the most sober of the ladies; who kindly&#xD;
otl~ered him a glassof the enlivening Nectar, and led&#xD;
him up to the bed, exactly opposite the door where&#xD;

&#xD;
Paddy was laid in state, and begged him to pray for&#xD;
the repose of his shoul. He answered, he never&#xD;
prayed, as he thought that was the proper business&#xD;
of the parsons, and they were paid for it. His dul&#xD;
cinea, however, burst out into the following excla- ~&#xD;
nation: "Arrah! by Jesus, why did you die? It was&#xD;
not for the want of milk, meal, or potatoes."&#xD;
In a remote corner of the cellar were three dray-&#xD;
men, six of his majesty's body guards, four sailors,&#xD;
five haymakers, ten chairmen, and six evidence ma&#xD;
kers, together with three bailiff's followers, who came&#xD;
by turns to view the body and drink repose to Pad&#xD;
dy's shoul; and to complete the group, they were at-&#xD;
tended by .Jack Ketch's journeyman. The compa-&#xD;
ny were much entertained with an old friend, Mr.&#xD;
Edward M'Quirk,. who was swearing, that he could&#xD;
carry a fare, hear mass, knock down a Middlesex&#xD;
freeholder, murder a peace officer, and afterwards&#xD;
receive a pension.&#xD;
At the head of the bed, where the remains of Pad..&#xD;
dy were placed, was the picture of the Virgin Mary,&#xD;
on one side, and that of St. Patrick on the other&#xD;
and at his feet was depicted, the devil and some of&#xD;
his angels, with the blood running down their backs&#xD;
occasioned by the flagellations which they had re-&#xD;
ceived from the disciples of Kentigern. One was&#xD;
swearing, a second counting his beads, a third drink-&#xD;
ing whisky, a fourth evacuating that load with&#xD;
which he had already overcharged himself' and&#xD;
whilst the priest was making an assignation with&#xD;
Catherine O'Reily, Jemmy Gahagan picked his&#xD;
pocket of his watch and a green purse, contain-&#xD;
ing a lock of St. Patrick's whiskers, esteemed an ef..&#xD;

taking notice of the priest, that whilst he was en-&#xD;
gaged with his doxey, he often turned to the deceas-&#xD;
ed, and repeated the words requiscal in pace.&#xD;

An Orphan he: yet rich in expectations,&#xD;
Which no body seemed likely to supplant-&#xD;
From that prodigious bore, of all relations,&#xD;
A fusty, chanting, stiff-rump'd, maiden aunt;&#xD;
The wealthy Miss Lucretia Cloghorty,&#xD;
Who had brought Isaac up, and own'd to forty!&#xD;
Shove, on this maiden's will relied securely;&#xD;
Who vow'd she ne'er would wed, to mar his riches'&#xD;
Full often would she say, of man, demurely-&#xD;
"I can't abide the filthy things in breeches!"&#xD;
He had apartments up two pair of stairs;&#xD;
On the first-floor lodged Dr. Crow,&#xD;
The landlord was a torturer of hairs,&#xD;
And made a great display of wigs, below~&#xD;
From the Beau's brutus, to the parson's frizzle-&#xD;
Over the door-way was his name; ~twas Twizzle.&#xD;

&#xD;
* lie didn't in Lucina's turnpike practise;&#xD;
He took bye-roads-reducing ladies' shapes,&#xD;
Who had secur'd themselves from "leading apes,&#xD;
But kept the reputation of virginity.&#xD;
Crow had a roomy tenement of brick,&#xD;
inclos'd with walls, one mile from Hyde-Park Corner&#xD;
Fir-trees and yews, were planted round it thick:&#xD;
No situation was forlorner!&#xD;
Yet, notwithstanding tblks might scout it,&#xD;
it suited qualurish spinsters, who fell sick,&#xD;
And did not wish the world to know about It.&#xD;
1-lere many a single gentlewoman came,&#xD;
Pro tempore-~--full tender of her fame!&#xD;
Who, for a while, took leave of friends in town-&#xD;
"Business, forsooth, to Yorkshire called her down,&#xD;
Too weighty to be settled by attorney!"&#xD;
And, in a month, or six week's time, came back;&#xD;
When ev'ry body cried-" Good lack!&#xD;
How monstrous thin you'Ve grown, upon your journey ~"&#xD;
The Doctor, knowing that a puff of scandal,&#xD;
Would blow his private trade to tatters;&#xD;
Dreaded to give the smallest handle,&#xD;
To those who dabble in their neighbours' matters:&#xD;
Therefore he wisely held it good,&#xD;
To hide his practise from the neighbourhood-&#xD;
And not to appear there as a resident;&#xD;
But, merely one who casually went,&#xD;
To see the ladies in the large brick house-&#xD;
To lounge, and chat-not minding time a souse-&#xD;
Like one to whom all business was quite foreign:&#xD;
And, thus, he visited his female sick;&#xD;
Who lay as thick,&#xD;
Within his tenement of brick,&#xD;
As rabbits in a warren,&#xD;
Tie lodged in Covent-garden all the while;&#xD;
And, if they sent in haste for his assistance,&#xD;
He soon was with them-'twas no mighty distance-a&#xD;
From the town's end, it was but bare a mile.&#xD;
1~4&#xD;
&#xD;
Now, Isaac Shove,&#xD;
Living above&#xD;
This Dr. Crow,&#xD;
And knowing barber Twizzle liv'd below,&#xD;
Thought it might be as well-&#xD;
Hearing so many knocks, single and double-&#xD;
To buy, at his own cost, a street-door bell,&#xD;
And save confusion in the house, and trouble!&#xD;
Whereby his (Isaac's) visitors might know,&#xD;
Without long waiting in the dirt and drizzle,&#xD;
To ring for him at once, and not to knock for Crow,&#xD;
Or Twizzle.&#xD;
Besides, he now began to feel,&#xD;
The want of it was rather ungent~el:&#xD;
For he had often thought it a disgrace,&#xD;
To hear, while sitting in his room above,&#xD;
Twizzle's shrill maid, in the first landing place,&#xD;
Screaming--" A man below ~'ants Mister Shove!"&#xD;
The bell was bought: the wire was made to steal&#xD;
Round the dark staircase, like a tortured eel,&#xD;
Twisting and twining.&#xD;
The jemmy handle Twizzle's door-post graced:&#xD;
And, just beneath, a brazen plate was placed,&#xD;
Lacquer'd, and shining-&#xD;
Graven whereon, in characters full clear,&#xD;
And legible, did "Mr. Shove" appear;&#xD;
And, furthermore, which you might read right well,&#xD;
Was-" Please to ring the belL"&#xD;
At half past ten, precisely, to a second,&#xD;
Shove, ev'ry night, his supper ended;&#xD;
And sipped his glass of negus, till hereckon'd,&#xD;
By his stop-watch, exactly one more quarter.&#xD;
Then, as exactly, he untied one garter;&#xD;
A token 'twas, that he for bed intended.&#xD;

Yd, having still, a quarter good before him,&#xD;
Lie leisurely undress'd before the sire:&#xD;
Contriving, as the quarter did exi~ire,&#xD;
To he as naked as his mother bore him~-~&#xD;
Bating his shirt, and night-cap on his head.&#xD;
Then, as the watchman bawl'd eleven,&#xD;
Lie had one foot in bed;&#xD;
More certainly, than cuckolds go to heav'n&#xD;
Alas! what pity 'tis, that regularity,&#xD;
Like Isaac Shove's, is such a rarity!&#xD;
But there are swilling wights in London town,&#xD;
Term'd, Jolly Dogs-Choice Spirits-alias, Swine;&#xD;
Who pour, in midnight revel, bumpers down,&#xD;
Making their throats a thoroughfare for Wine.&#xD;
These spendt~tuifts, who life's pleasures thus outrun--&#xD;
Dosing, with he ad-achs, till the afternoon-&#xD;
Losing half men's regular estate of sun,&#xD;
By borrowing too largely of the moon.&#xD;
One of this kidney-Toby Tosspot bight-&#xD;
Was coming from the Bedford, late at night:&#xD;
And being Bacchi p/en us-full of wine-&#xD;
Altho' he had a tolerable notion,&#xD;
Of aiming' at progressive motion,&#xD;
'Twas not direct-'twas serpentine.&#xD;
He work'd, with sinuosities, along;&#xD;
Like Monsieur Corkscrew, worming through a cork;&#xD;
Not straight, like Corkscrew's proxy-stiff Don Prong-&#xD;
A fork!&#xD;
At length, with near four bottles in his pate,&#xD;
He saw the moon shining on Shove's brnss plate-&#xD;
&#xD;
When, reading-" Please to ring the bell;"&#xD;
And being civil, beyond measure-&#xD;
1' Ring it!" sass Toby-" very~ well!&#xD;
I'll ring it with a deal of pleasure"&#xD;

&#xD;
Toby, the kindest soul in all the town,&#xD;
Gave it a jerk-that almost jerk 'd it down.&#xD;
lie waited full two minutes; no one came:&#xD;
lie Waite(l full two minutes more; and then,&#xD;
Says Toby-" if lie's deaf, I'm not to blame!&#xD;
I'll pull it for the gentleman again.''&#xD;
But the first peal woke Isaac, in fright;&#xD;
Who, quick as lightning popping up his head,&#xD;
Sat on his head's antipodes, ~n bed-&#xD;
I~ale as a parsnip-bolt upright.&#xD;
At length he, wisely, to himself did say-&#xD;
Calming his fears-&#xD;
"Tush! 'tis some fool has rung, and ran away!"&#xD;
When peal the second rattled in his ears.&#xD;
Sho~rejump'd into the middle of the floor;&#xD;
And, trembling at each breath of air that stirr'd,&#xD;
He groped down stairs, and opened the street door,&#xD;
While Toby was performing peal the third!&#xD;
Isaac eyed Toby, fearfully askaunt;&#xD;
~And saw he was a strapper-stout, and tall:&#xD;
Then put this question-" Pray, Sir, what d'ye want?'&#xD;
Says Toby-" I want nothing, Sir, at all."&#xD;
"Want nothing?-Sir! you've pulled my bell, I vow,&#xD;
As if you'd jerk it off the wire!"&#xD;
Quoth Toby-gravely making him a bow-&#xD;
"I pulled it, Sir, at your desire."&#xD;
"At mine?"-" Yes, yours!-L hope I've done it well!&#xD;
High time for bed, Sir!-I was hastenin gto it;&#xD;
But, if you write up-" Please to ring the bell,"&#xD;
Common politeness makes m~ stop and do it"&#xD;
&#xD;
Isaac, now waxing wroth apace,&#xD;
Slamm'd the street-door in Toby's face,&#xD;
With all his might;&#xD;

THE&#xD;
&#xD;
FISHERMAN'S LAW SUIT.&#xD;
&#xD;
B~ the side of' the sea, in a cottage obscure,&#xD;
There liv'd an old fellow, narn'd Peter Boncceur,&#xD;
Who was free to his neighbours, and good to the poor.&#xD;
Catching fish was his trade;&#xD;
And all people said,&#xD;
That mischief to nothing but fish he designed:&#xD;
To ev'ry thing else, he was candid and kind.&#xD;
One day, as he went to the brink of the lake,&#xD;
Persuading the fishes their dinners to take,&#xD;
The last, he intended, they ever should make;&#xD;
While his hooks lie employed, to their sorrow and woe,&#xD;
A grunting he heard, in the waters below:&#xD;
And, casting his eye to the bottom-for here,&#xD;
We'll suppose that the water is perfectly clear--&#xD;
He saw, on the bed of the liquid profound.&#xD;
An unfortunate wight, who was drowning, or drowned.&#xD;
That the man to the surface once more might ascend&#xD;
He took up his pole with a hook at the end:&#xD;
Thentoithe fell,&#xD;
And managed so well,&#xD;
That soon to the margin the carcase was drawn;&#xD;
And who should it prove, but his old neighbour John.&#xD;
Now, some how or other, it popp'd in his head,&#xD;
That, in spite of his drowning, the man w~' t dead;&#xD;
And, while he was thinking what means to devise,&#xD;
That his friend might recover and open his eyes,&#xD;
He saw, with vexation and sorrow, no doubt,&#xD;
That, in lugging him up, he one eye had put out.&#xD;
However, persuaded, by what he had heard,&#xD;
That the man might be living, for aught that appeared'&#xD;
To his cottage he took him, and there had him bled,&#xD;

ing along one morning before day-light, when Gia&#xD;
netto espied a gulf, with a beautiful harbour, and ask&#xD;
ed the captain the name of it, to which he made an-&#xD;
swer, and said, "that place belongs to a noble widow&#xD;
who has been the cause of the ruin of many gentle-&#xD;
men." "How?" said Gianetto; "Sir," said the cap-&#xD;
tain, "this is a most beaut~fal and enchanting lady,&#xD;
who has established as a law in her domains, that&#xD;
whoever lands there must lay with her, and if he&#xD;
can pass the night without sleep, he is at liberty to&#xD;
marry her, and then becomes master of the harbour,&#xD;
and all the estate; whereas, if he does not, he loses&#xD;
his cargo and every thing he has brought with him."&#xD;
Gianetto paused awhile, then said, "you must man-&#xD;
age how you can, but sail into that harbour." "Sir2'&#xD;
said the captain, "think well on what you are say-&#xD;
ing, for many gentleman has gone there who has&#xD;
been driven away pennyless." "Do not concern&#xD;
yourself about that, but do as I desire you," said Gia-&#xD;
netto. Of course the thing was done, and on they&#xD;
sailed, without their companions noticing the course&#xD;
they had taken.&#xD;
On the morning the news was spread that this fine&#xD;
ship had reached the harbour, so that all the people&#xD;
'~ame to see it: the lady was soon informed of it, and&#xD;
sent for Gianetto, who immediately presented him-&#xD;
self respectfully to her. The lady took him by the&#xD;
hand, asked him who he was, whence he came, and&#xD;
whether he knew the usage of the place? Gianetto&#xD;
answered he did, and only came there in conse-&#xD;
quence of this knowledge. A thousand times wel-&#xD;
come, said the virtuous lady, and h'onoured and cxi-&#xD;
tertained him nobly, sending for the barons, counts,&#xD;
and knights, to welcome and amuse him. Gianetto's&#xD;
manners delighted alt around him, and the day was&#xD;
spent in dancing, singing, and festivity, by the court,&#xD;
in honour of Gianetto, and one and all would have&#xD;
been pleased to have him for their lord. Evening&#xD;
coming on, the lady took him by the hand, and led&#xD;
him into an apartment, saying, "methiiiks it seems&#xD;
148&#xD;
&#xD;
!          I&#xD;
&#xD;
A&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
time to withdraw." "Madam," said Gianetto, "I am&#xD;
at your command." Two young damsels came, the&#xD;
one bringing wine in her hand, and the other some&#xD;
sweetmeats. "I know," said the lady, "you must&#xD;
be thirsty, therefore drink." Gianetto took some of&#xD;
the sweetmeats, and drank some of the wine, which&#xD;
had been prepared as a sleeping draught, but he&#xD;
knew it not. He drank half a goblet, for it seemed&#xD;
very pleasant to him; and then he soon undressed&#xD;
and went to bed; no sooner had he laid down, than&#xD;
he fell asleep; the lady laid herself down by the side&#xD;
of the youth, who never woke till the next morning&#xD;
about three o'clock.&#xD;
The lady got up as soon as it was daylight, and om-&#xD;
dered the ship to be unlad en, which she found contain-&#xD;
ed a store of rich and good wares. It being now past&#xD;
three, the lady's maid went into Gianetto's room, and&#xD;
made him rise, and told him he might depart, for&#xD;
that he had lost the ship, and all it contained; upon&#xD;
this he felt quite ashamed, and he thought he had&#xD;
certainly acted wrong. rrhe lady ordered a horse&#xD;
and money to be given to him, and dismissed him,&#xD;
and he departed overwhelmed with sorrow. He ar-&#xD;
rived at Venice, but being ashamed, he would not go&#xD;
home, but in the evening went to a friend, who won-&#xD;
dering, said, "alasq Gianetto, what means this?"-&#xD;
"My ship," said he, "dashed in the night against a&#xD;
rock, and went to pieces; all was lost; some saved&#xD;
themselves as well as they could; I caught fast hold&#xD;
of a plank that brought me on shore, and have come&#xD;
home by land, and here I am." Gianetto remaine(l&#xD;
several days with his friend, who sometime after paid&#xD;
a visit to Messer Ansa do, whom he found quite dis..&#xD;
consolate. Ansaldo said, "I am in great apprehen-&#xD;
sion that this son of mine is dead, or ill fi'om the voy-&#xD;
age; the love I bear him is such, that I have no&#xD;
peace or comfort from this fear." The young man&#xD;
answered, "I can bring you news of him. He has&#xD;
been shipwrecked, and lost every thing except his&#xD;
life." "\Vell," said Messer Ansaldo, "heaven be&#xD;

praised, provided he lives, I care not for any thing&#xD;
that is lost; where is he?"--" He is at my house,"&#xD;
replied the young man; and Ansaldo immediately&#xD;
would go to him; and as soon as he saw him, he ran&#xD;
to embrace him, saying, "my son, don't be ashamed&#xD;
before me, for it is often the case~ that ships founder,&#xD;
therefore do not fret, for since thou hast not suffered&#xD;
any personal injury, I am at ease;" so saying, he&#xD;
took him home, consoling him as much as he could&#xD;
on the way.&#xD;
The news of Gianetto's misfortune soon got wind,&#xD;
and grieved all that knew him. It happened that a&#xD;
little while after this, his companions returned from&#xD;
Alexandria, both very rich, and on their arrival en-&#xD;
quired for their friend Gianetto. They were no&#xD;
sooner told the whole circumstance, than they ran&#xD;
to him, and embracing him, said, "how camest tho'~&#xD;
to leave us, and where didst thou go? for we never&#xD;
could hear any thing of thee. W~e sailed back, to&#xD;
and fro, but never could see, or hear where thou&#xD;
~vast gone. Indeed we have been most melancholy&#xD;
on our return, for we thought thou wast dead."&#xD;
Gianetto answered, "a heavy gale arose that drove&#xD;
my ship into a creek, right on a .~ock near land, and&#xD;
I scarcely could save myself-all was lost !" This&#xD;
was the excuse Gianetto gave in order to conceal&#xD;
his silly conduct. They both were thankful that he&#xD;
had escaped, and said, "next spring, withy heaven's&#xD;
blessing, we will gain as much more as thou hast lost,&#xD;
therefore let us be merry as usual, and give sorrow&#xD;
to the wind." Yet Gianetto could not help think-&#xD;
ing how he could return to the lady, saying, "I must&#xD;
have her for my wife, or die for it." With such&#xD;
thoughts he could tiot give way to mirth. Ansaldo.&#xD;
therefore, often said to him, "do not fret, we have&#xD;
still wherewithal to live at ease." "Sir," said Gi&#xD;
anetto, "I imever can be happy if I do not make ano&#xD;
ther voyage." Ansaldo hearing this, and that such&#xD;
was his anxious wish, when the time came, he pro-&#xD;
vided him with a ship laden with still more property&#xD;
1 5(Y&#xD;
&#xD;
than before, insomuch that he put on board almost&#xD;
the whole of his possessions.&#xD;
His companions, when their ships were stored, set&#xD;
sail in company with Gianetto: as they were sailing,&#xD;
Gianetto looked out with anxiety for ~he harbour of&#xD;
his lady, which was called the port of the Lady Bel-&#xD;
monte, and arriving one evening at the mouth of the&#xD;
creek, Gianetto soon recognized it, and ordered the&#xD;
ship to be steered into the harbour, so that his friends&#xD;
did not perceive it.&#xD;
The lady, on rising in the morning, looking to the&#xD;
harbour, saw th~ ship, and the colours playing in the&#xD;
wind, which recognizing, she called her woman, and&#xD;
said, "dost thou know those colours?"-" Madam,"&#xD;
said the waiting woman, "it seems the same ship&#xD;
that brought that young man about a year ago, who&#xD;
had such riches on board." "True," said the lady,&#xD;
"J believe thou art right, and certainly this youth&#xD;
must be 'downright in love with me, for I have never&#xD;
seen any one return here again." "I," said the&#xD;
maid, "never saw a more graceful or courteous fel-&#xD;
low than he is." The lady sent several eqi~erries&#xD;
and damsels to him, who paid him hom~~, and led&#xD;
him joyfully to the castle, and into the presence of&#xD;
the lady. When she saw him, she embraced him af-&#xD;
fectionately, a~d he most respectfully saluted her.&#xD;
All the nobles were invited to partake of the day's&#xD;
pleasure in honour of Gianetto. They all admired&#xD;
how well he led a dance, and the ladies were quite&#xD;
charmed at the elegance of his person and manners,&#xD;
and thought he must be the son of some great lord.&#xD;
But the same thing happened again. He lost his&#xD;
ship and all his property, and arrived at Venice with-&#xD;
out a ducat.&#xD;
In the evenim~ he went to his friend, who was&#xD;
thunderstruck at sight of him. "Alas! what does&#xD;
this mean?" said he. " My cursed ill-luck," said&#xD;
Gianetto, "that I should ever have come into this&#xD;
country." " Well rtiayest thou curse thy ill stars,"&#xD;
said his friend "for thou hast rujijed poor Messer&#xD;

Ansaldo, who was one of the richest Christian mer4&#xD;
chants, and worst of all is the discredit."&#xD;
Gianetto remained concealed several days at his&#xD;
friend's house, without knowing what to say or&#xD;
what to do, and was inclined to return to Florence,&#xD;
without letting Messer Ansaldo know it; but after&#xD;
a little reflection he bethought him he would go to&#xD;
him, and did so.&#xD;
When Messer Ansaldo saw him, he arose, and ran&#xD;
to embrace him, and said, "welcome, my son."&#xD;
Gianetto, weeping, embraced him; but when Ansal-&#xD;
do had~heard the account, he said, "do not repine;&#xD;
as I have got thee again, I am not downhearted;&#xD;
there remains still enough for us to hold up, and be&#xD;
comfortable; the o~ ean will sometimes take from the&#xD;
one arid give to an~ her." The news, however, soon&#xD;
spread itself in Venice, every one spoke of it, an~&#xD;
grieved at the losses he had had, but Messer Ansal-&#xD;
do was compelled to sell ~many possessions he had, to&#xD;
pay ~he creditors who had furnished him with the&#xD;
goods. It happened that those companions of Gia-&#xD;
netto returned from Alexandria very rich, and on&#xD;
their arrival at Venice, were informed of Gianetto's&#xD;
situation, and how he had lost every thing, which&#xD;
they very much wondered at, saying, "this is the&#xD;
strangest thing that ever was heard of." However,&#xD;
they went to Messer Ansaldo and Qianetto, and com-&#xD;
forting him, said, "Signor, do not be disheartened,&#xD;
we intend to go next year, and trade for you, for we&#xD;
are partly the cause of these your losses, since it was&#xD;
we who induced Gianetto to go with us in the first&#xD;
instance; therefore be under no apprehension, and&#xD;
whilst we have property, command it as your own."&#xD;
Messed Ansaldo thanked them, and said that he had&#xD;
still wherewith to live well. Gianetto, meanwhile,&#xD;
dwelling night and day on the dismal prospect and&#xD;
losses he had sustained, could not possibly conceal&#xD;
his chagrin, the which Ansaldo perceiving, he asked&#xD;
him what was the matter with him?-" I shall never&#xD;
be happy, if I do not recover that which I have lost."&#xD;
I ~2&#xD;

&#xD;
C My son," replied Ansaldo, "I will not have thee&#xD;
go again, because it is better that we rest quietly&#xD;
with what little remains to us, than to run any more&#xD;
risks." " I am fully resolved," said Gianetto, "to&#xD;
do my utmost, and should be quite ashamed, and&#xD;
think myself dishonourable if I did not, and remain-&#xD;
ed in this situation."&#xD;
Ansaldo, perceiving it was his fixed determination,&#xD;
prepared to sell out whatever he had remaining, and&#xD;
freight the youth another fine ship. As he was short&#xD;
of ten thousand ducats, he went to a Jew and bor..&#xD;
rowed the sum on the following conditions (having&#xD;
no other security to give:) that if he did not return&#xD;
the money within that midsummer-day twelvemonth,&#xD;
the Jew might cut off one pound of flesh from any&#xD;
part of his body; which the Jew accepting, Ansaldo&#xD;
was relieved: the Jew took care to have this agree-&#xD;
ment drawn up, and authenticated in all due form&#xD;
before witnesses, with all the precaution that men&#xD;
of business usually take in such matters; then count-&#xD;
ed over the ten thousand ducats in gold to Messer&#xD;
A.psaldo, who supplied the ship with every thing that&#xD;
was requisite, and though the two last were beauti-&#xD;
ful, yet this was much richer than either. The two&#xD;
friends loaded theirs with full intention that the pro-&#xD;
(luce should be for Gianetto.&#xD;
XVhen the moment for their departure came, Mes-&#xD;
ses Ansaldo said to Gianetto, "my son, thou art go-&#xD;
ing, and thou knowest under what penalty I labour;&#xD;
I do pray thee, that though any misfortune should&#xD;
again happen to thee, that thou comes to me, and let&#xD;
me behold thee ere I die; then shall I rest conten~*'~&#xD;
"Messer Ansaldo," said the youth, "I shall do every&#xD;
thing that will make you happy." Ansaldo gave&#xD;
him his blessing, they took leave of each other, and&#xD;
he embarked.&#xD;
The two friends narrowly watched Gianetto's ship;&#xD;
and he was carefully looking out for the port of Bel-&#xD;
monte, and at last succeeded in ~)crsuading the cap-&#xD;
~ain to strike into the said harbour during the night&#xD;

When the dawn appeared, the two friends lookert&#xD;
about for Gianetto's ship, and, not seeing it, said,&#xD;
"really this poor fellow is truly unfortunate." Not&#xD;
knowing how to find him out, they agreed it were&#xD;
safer to follow their voyage, seeing there were no&#xD;
hopes of n~ meeting with him. The ship~being arrived&#xD;
in the port, all came forth to see it, on hearing that&#xD;
Giane~to had returned, and wondering very much at&#xD;
it, said, "this n-inst be the son of some great lord, if&#xD;
we reflect that he comes every year with such rich&#xD;
cargoes, and such fine ships-.would to heaven he&#xD;
were our lord." Thus was he courted by all the&#xD;
barons and knights of that land; the lady was soon&#xD;
informed that Gianetto had returned; she advanced&#xD;
to the window, and beheld the beautiful ship, and&#xD;
recognized the colours; crossing herself, she said,&#xD;
"surely this is the great man who has so enriched&#xD;
this country;" and she sent for him, and he went to&#xD;
her; they embraced and saluted each other, and the&#xD;
whole day was spent in joy; and to honour Gianetto,&#xD;
a grand tilt was ordered; and Gianetto would also&#xD;
be one among them, and did wonders by the e1egan~e&#xD;
and activity of his person. So far did he excel, that&#xD;
all the barons were most anxious that he should&#xD;
p rove their lord. The usual time approaching, the&#xD;
lady said, C(J thi4 it is fit we go to rest," and took&#xD;
his hand to lead hi~ into the room, when one of the&#xD;
lady's women, who was much grieved at Gianetto's&#xD;
mischances, whispered at the threshold of the door, as&#xD;
he was following the lady, and said, "pretend as if&#xD;
you were drinking, but do not drink to-night." Gia-&#xD;
netto heard the whisper and went in with the lady&#xD;
"I know," said she, "you are thirsty, therefore, I&#xD;
will have you drink before you go to rest." Two&#xD;
beautiful creatures immediately entered, bringing&#xD;
ivine and swectme4ts, and presented, as usual, the&#xD;
Wine and cakes, and he said, "how could any one&#xD;
abstain from drinking this wine, handed as it is by&#xD;
two such beautiful maidens;" which saying made the&#xD;
lady laugh; and Gianetto took the goblet, and, pre&#xD;
1 ~4&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
tending to drink, he let the wine drop down int0 his&#xD;
bosom. The lady, thinking he had drank it off, said&#xD;
within herself, thou must return with another cargo,~&#xD;
for this is lost to thee; but Gianetto went to bed, and&#xD;
felt himself quite wakeful, and it seemed an age be~&#xD;
fore the lady came to bed; and he kept saying to&#xD;
himself, by the mass I have caught you now, fair&#xD;
lady, you have reckoned this time without your host:&#xD;
and as the lady delayed some time coming to bed, he&#xD;
began to snore as if asleep; therefore, the lady said&#xD;
to herself, this is all as it should be, and immediately&#xD;
undressed, and laid herself down by Gianetto, who,&#xD;
the moment she was under cover, showed he was&#xD;
awake, and thus he remained the whole night. The&#xD;
lady rose before morx~ing, and sent for all the barons,&#xD;
knights, and citizens, to the council chamber, and&#xD;
said to them, " Gianetto is your lord, therefore, re-&#xD;
joice and make merry." This being spread abroad,&#xD;
nothing was heard but the general cry of, "long live&#xD;
our lord," and the ringing of bells, and sounds of&#xD;
various instruments. Several barons who were ab-&#xD;
sent from the castle were sent for to pay homage to&#xD;
their lord, and a great rejoicing took place; and&#xD;
Gianetto, when he came from his room, was knight-&#xD;
ed, and placed in the seat of honour with the baton in&#xD;
his hand, and hailed as sovereign lord; and when all&#xD;
the nobility were arrived at court, he was married&#xD;
to the lady amidst such festivity as can scarcely be&#xD;
credited, for all the barons, knights, and gentry,&#xD;
were invited to the tilts, the sham-fights, dances, mu.&#xD;
sic, singing, and every thing that is usual on such&#xD;
extraordinary occasions. Gianetto, being a noble-&#xD;
spirited youth, began to bestow presents of rich silks,&#xD;
and other things which he had brought, and took&#xD;
upon himself a manly conduct; made ~himself&#xD;
obeyed, and enforced the laws towards all his sub-&#xD;
jects, and was enjoying all the pleasures and com-&#xD;
forts, without once thinking of poor Ansaldo, who&#xD;
hail pledged Firnself for ten thousand ducats to the&#xD;
Jew. However, being one day looking out of thr~&#xD;

window with his lady, he saw a number of persons&#xD;
carrying g small torches who were going with offer-&#xD;
ings in great pomp. Gianetto sai(l to his bride,&#xD;
"pray, lady, what means this?" the lady replied,&#xD;
"that is a procession of mechanics who are going to&#xD;
carry their offerings to the church of St. John, this&#xD;
day being his festival :" this called to Gianetto's mind&#xD;
the case of Ansaldo. He withdrew from the win-&#xD;
dow, and heaved a deep sigh, and grew quite pale,&#xD;
talkingg to and fro in the room, thinking of the cir-&#xD;
cumstance. On the lady's asking him what was the&#xD;
matter with him, Gianetto answered, "nothing."&#xD;
The lady then began to consider him attentively:&#xD;
"Certainly," said she, "something ails you, and&#xD;
you wilf not own it;" and she coaxed him so much,&#xD;
that at last Gianetto related to her how Messer An-&#xD;
saldo had pledged himself to the amount of ten thou~&#xD;
sand ducats; and this very day, said he, is the day&#xD;
fixed, and I am distracted at the thought my poor&#xD;
father should die on my account, for if to-day the&#xD;
sum is not paid, he loses one pound of flesh cut off&#xD;
from his body. The lady replied, "take horse di-&#xD;
rectly, and go by land, which will be the quickest,&#xD;
and take with you such attendants as you like, with&#xD;
a hundred thousand ducats, and rest not till you ar-&#xD;
rive at Venice, and, if he be not dead, do you en-&#xD;
deavour to bring him here." The horn was quick-&#xD;
ly blown; he mounted his steed, accompanied by&#xD;
twenty attendants, arid, having taken money enough,&#xD;
journeyed with speed to Venice. The Jew had&#xD;
caused Messer Ai1saldo to be arrested, and wanted&#xD;
to have the pound of flesh; upon which Ansaldo en-&#xD;
treated him to delay his death for a few days, that,&#xD;
in case Gianetto should come, he might see him.&#xD;
The Jew said, "I am willing to grant what you ask&#xD;
as to the delay, but were he to come a hundred times&#xD;
over, I will have the pound of flesh from your body,&#xD;
as agreed on ~n the note." Ansaldo answered that&#xD;
he was satisfied. The news of this having spread&#xD;
itself through Venice, several merchants agreed to&#xD;
156&#xD;
&#xD;
7&#xD;
&#xD;
pay the money, but the .Jew would not consent, be.&#xD;
ing netermine(l on his death, that he might say he&#xD;
had been the death of the first and greatest Chris-&#xD;
tian merchant. However, it happened that when&#xD;
Gianetto started in great haste to come to Venice,&#xD;
his lady followed close after him, dressed as a judge,&#xD;
with two servants with her. Gianetto, when he ar-&#xD;
rived at Venice, went directly to the Jew, and ern~&#xD;
braced Messer Ansaldo; then said to the Jew, that&#xD;
he wished to give him the money, and so much be-&#xD;
side as he might require; the Jew replied that he&#xD;
would not receive the money, since it was not paid&#xD;
at the proper time; that he would have the pound&#xD;
of flesh: and here was the great question; every one&#xD;
was against the Jew, but still, as Venice was con~&#xD;
sidered the seat of justice, and the Jew had it plain-&#xD;
ly on his side, and in proper form, non's dared to&#xD;
oppose him, but by entreaties' so that all the mer-&#xD;
chants went to the Jew to beg and pray him to desist,&#xD;
but as he was more obstinate, Gianetto offered him&#xD;
twenty thousand, yet he would not consent;. thirty&#xD;
thousand were then offered-forty thousand-fifty&#xD;
thousand-till at last he was offered one hundred&#xD;
thousand. " Look ye, sirs," said tlw Jew, "if you&#xD;
were to offer me as many more ducats as are to be&#xD;
found in Venice, I would not take them; on the con-&#xD;
trary, I will abide by what the agreement states."&#xD;
While they were thus arguing the point, the lady&#xD;
arrived at Venice, dressed in the habit of a judge,&#xD;
and alighted at an inn; the landlord asked one of the&#xD;
attendants who the gentleman was. The servant,&#xD;
who had been previously instructed in what he had to&#xD;
say, replied, "this is a gentleman, a judge returning&#xD;
from Bologna, where he has studied the law, and is&#xD;
now going home." The landlord hearing this, paid&#xD;
him -every attention; and~ when at table, lie said to&#xD;
th~ landlord, " what is the government of your city,&#xD;
landlord?" The landlord answered, "there is too&#xD;
much law, sir." " How?" said the judge. " I will&#xD;

Ansaldo; this youth was so genteel and well bred.&#xD;
that he became the darling of all that knew him, but&#xD;
never did a more unfortunate man walk this city;&#xD;
three times did hi~ godfather freight ships to a great&#xD;
amount, and every time he lost his all; so that at the&#xD;
last, wanting money, Ansaldo borrowed ten thousand&#xD;
ducats of a Jew, under a promise that if he did not&#xD;
return them on St. John's day, in June to come, the&#xD;
said Jew should have a right to take from his body&#xD;
one pound of flesh, wherever he might choose; now,&#xD;
this blessed youth iS retUrne(l, and has offered one&#xD;
hundred thousand ducats, instead of the ten thou-&#xD;
sand; and the scoundrel of a Jew will not take them;&#xD;
all the best men in Venice have gone to entreat, but&#xD;
to no purpose:' The judge said, "but this ques-&#xD;
tion is easy to determine1" The host said, "if you&#xD;
will take the task on yourself, and end this business,&#xD;
so as to save the good man's life, you will acquire the&#xD;
friendship and love of the most noble and virtuous&#xD;
youth that ever was born, beside the blessing of&#xD;
all the people in this city." The feigned judge&#xD;
ordered it to be posted up through Venice, that if&#xD;
any critical and extraordinary law-case should oc-&#xD;
cur, that they might come to him and he would make&#xD;
out a clear case. The news of this beingcarried to&#xD;
Gianetto, that there had arrived a judge from Bo-&#xD;
logna, who would determine any law question, Gia-&#xD;
netto called on the Jew, and said to him, "let us go&#xD;
to this said judge." XVeII said the Jew, "let us go;&#xD;
but whatever he or any one may say or do, 1 will abide&#xD;
by the written agreement." When they caine to&#xD;
the judge, Gianetto did not recognize him, but she&#xD;
knew him well. Gianetto and the Jew both related&#xD;
theirown story; thejudge, after reading the agree-&#xD;
ment, said to the Jew, "1 advise you to take the of-&#xD;
fered hundred thousand ducats, and let this good man&#xD;
free, wh will ever feel indebted to you:" to which&#xD;
the Jew answered, "no, not 1, I will do no such a&#xD;
1 ~&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
thing." "That is the best thing you can do." "No&#xD;
no !" replied the Jew, "I'll do no such thing." Upon&#xD;
this they all went to the court, where such matters&#xD;
were brought to issue. The feigned judge taking&#xD;
upon himself the defence of Ansaldo, said, "order&#xD;
Ansaldo to come into court;" which being done, the&#xD;
judge said, "do thou take now one pound of flesh&#xD;
from him, where thou wilt, and go thy ways;" upon&#xD;
which the Jew orderedhim to be stripped; took a&#xD;
razor in his hand, which he had brought for the pur-&#xD;
p~, whe r~\1 esser Gianetto turned to the judge and&#xD;
said, ~' thi~ sir, was not what I entreated you would&#xD;
do for me." "Make yourself easy," said the judge,&#xD;
"he has not yet cut off the pound of flesh." In the&#xD;
meanwhile the Jew wa~ eyeing Ansaldo all over to&#xD;
see where he should cut. "Mind what you are&#xD;
about," said the judge, "for, should you take more&#xD;
or less than one pound, I'll have you hanged. I tell&#xD;
thee, Jew, if thou spillest one single drop of blood&#xD;
thou shalt die, for thy agreement does not mention&#xD;
thou art to shed one drop of blood; moreover, it states&#xD;
thou art to take one pound of flesh, neither more nor&#xD;
less; therefore, if thou art wise, beware what thou&#xD;
doest;" and he immediately sent for the executioner,&#xD;
ordered the handcuffs and fetters to be brought to&#xD;
him~ saying, '~ if I see one single drop of blood fall,&#xD;
thy head shall be severed from thy body." The Jew&#xD;
then began to quake, and Gianetto to leap with joy;&#xD;
but, after some contention the Jew said, "your&#xD;
worship has outwitted me~ therefore let me have the&#xD;
hundred thousand ducats, and I will be satisfied."&#xD;
"No," said the judge, I will have thee take the&#xD;
pound of flesh, as the paper states, for I will not give&#xD;
thee a stiver; thou should est, have taken them when&#xD;
they were offered to thee." The Jew then said,&#xD;
"ninety thousand;" thon, "eight'~ thousand;" but&#xD;
still the judge was inflexible. "Let us give him&#xD;
what he asks," said Gianetto, "provided he let him&#xD;
free." "Let me alone," said the judge. The Jew&#xD;
then said, "give me fifty thousand." "I would not&#xD;

then," said the Jew, "give me my tei~i thousand dii-&#xD;
cats, and a curse be with you all." "Hast thou not&#xD;
heard me," said the judge, "I will not give thee a&#xD;
doit; take thou the pound of flesh if thou wilt, if thou&#xD;
wilt not, I'll make thee cancel the writing." All&#xD;
present were overjoyed, and laughed at the Jew, in&#xD;
seeing the biter so completely bit.&#xD;
The Jew, finding he could not compass his mali~&#xD;
cious intent, took the papers, and, being desperately&#xD;
enraged, tore them to bits, and threw~he~n on the&#xD;
ground. Thus was Messer Ansaldo liii rated and&#xD;
conducted home by Gianetto; who immediately tak-&#xD;
ing the one hundred thousand ducats, went to the&#xD;
judge, and found him in his room ready to go home&#xD;
again; upon which Messer Gianetto said to him,&#xD;
"sir, you have rendered me the greatest service, and&#xD;
done me the greatest kindness; therefore, I request&#xD;
you to take this money along with you, for you have&#xD;
well earned it." "I thank you kindly, Messer Gia-&#xD;
nettQ," said the judge, " but I am not the least in&#xD;
want of it; take it back with you, that your wife&#xD;
may not say you have made a hard bargain." "Upon&#xD;
my faith," said Gianetto, "if I were to spend four&#xD;
times as much, she is so noble-minded, kind, and&#xD;
generous, she would not in the least be displeased~&#xD;
for she wished me to offer more, if needful." "How&#xD;
do you feel towards her?" said the judge. " There&#xD;
is not a woman on earth Icould love so much, she is&#xD;
so chaste and as beautiful as nature could possibly&#xD;
make her, and if you will oblige us so far, you will&#xD;
come and see her. You will be charmed with her,&#xD;
and the great politeness she will show you, and you&#xD;
will then judge whether what I say is true or not."&#xD;
"As to coming with you I cannot, for I have other&#xD;
things to attended to, but since you say she is so be-&#xD;
nevolent, when you see her, present my best respects&#xD;
to her." "I will," said Gianetto, " but I wish you&#xD;
to take some of this money;" and while he was speak-&#xD;
ing, the judge perceived a ring on his finger, and&#xD;
160&#xD;
&#xD;
said, "I wish to have that ring, nor will I have any&#xD;
thing else from you." Gianetto answered, "I am&#xD;
agree able to it, yet I give it you somewhat unwilling..&#xD;
ly, because it is the gift of my wife, and she desired I&#xD;
would always wear it for her sake, and should she&#xD;
notice I have it not, she will think I gave it to some&#xD;
woman l~ am in love with, and I love her more~ than&#xD;
myself." "I think," replied the judge, "that if she&#xD;
loves you so truly, she will readily believe&#xD;
when you tell her you gave it to me' butperhaps,&#xD;
you yourself wish to give it away to some favourite&#xD;
lady in Venice." "The love I bear her," said Gia-.&#xD;
netto, "is such, that there is not the woman created&#xD;
that I would prefer to her, so good, so beautiful is&#xD;
she;" and so saying, he took the ring from his finger&#xD;
and presented it to the judge, embracing him. "I&#xD;
entreat you," said the latter, "to do me a favor."&#xD;
"Mention it, I pray you," said Gianetto. "Do not&#xD;
stay here, but return soon to your lady." "Indeed,"&#xD;
said Gianetto, "it seems to me an age since I have&#xD;
seen her;" and thereupon they parted. The judge&#xD;
stept into the g&amp;amp;idola, and went in peace. Gia..&#xD;
netto treated all his acquaintance, made them pre-&#xD;
sents, and kept open house; then took leave of all&#xD;
his Venetian connexions, taking with him Messer&#xD;
Ansaldo, and many of his former friends, and set off&#xD;
for Belmorite. Most of those of both sexes he left&#xD;
behind, grieved much at his departure, so nobly had&#xD;
he behaved while with them. Now it happened that&#xD;
the lady had arrived several days previous, and had&#xD;
ordered great preparations to be made. The houses&#xD;
were all hung with tapestry; several companies of&#xD;
armed troops were posted here and there, anti when&#xD;
Messier Gianetto and Ansaldo arrived, all the knights&#xD;
and barons, with the rest of the court, went to meet&#xD;
him, crying out, "long live our worthy lord !" and&#xD;
when he reached Belmonte, the lady embraced An-&#xD;

and singing among the ladies and (lamseIs that were&#xD;
present. Gianetto seeing his lady did not looks kind~&#xD;
ly towards him as she was wont to do, went jnto his&#xD;
own room and sent for her. "What isthe matter with&#xD;
you?" Sai(l he. " There is no occasion for this oul.&#xD;
war  show of tenderness," said the lady, "for I know&#xD;
you have found out your old favourite lady." Gia-&#xD;
netto began to exculpate himself. The lady said,&#xD;
where is the ring I gave you ?" "Well," said Gia-&#xD;
netto, "what I anticipated is come to l)ass; I sai(1, I&#xD;
was sure you would be displeased, but I solemnly swear&#xD;
to you, by all that is sacred, that I gave the ring to&#xD;
the judge that eNtricated Ansaldo from his difficul-&#xD;
ties)' "An&amp;amp;Lswear," said she, "by all that I hold&#xD;
most dear, that thou hast given it to a woman. I&#xD;
know it well, and thou ~ughtest to be ashamed to per-&#xD;
jure thyself thus." "May I die this moment said&#xD;
Gianetto "if I do not tell thee true; and, besides, I&#xD;
told the judge how it would turn out." "~,Fhou&#xD;
might have stayed where thou wert, and have sent&#xD;
Ansaldo here by hin~self, and enjoyed thyself, amon&#xD;
thy damsels, for I hear they all wept at thy (l(~part-&#xD;

ed, and could not refrain from tears, say~ng~" thou&#xD;
swearest what is not true, and what could not be."&#xD;
The lady, however, seeing he was in great agitation,&#xD;
and quite miserable, it went to her heart, and she ran&#xD;
to embrace him, laughing immoderately, and show-&#xD;
ing him the ring, and repeated to him every thing&#xD;
he had said to the judge, and how she herself had&#xD;
acted the part of the judge, and in what manner he&#xD;
had given him the ring. Gianetto marvelled at&#xD;
this account, but seeing it was all true, he began to&#xD;
feel relieved, and extremely pleased, and going out&#xD;
of the room, related the story to some of his friends,&#xD;
and the adventure increased their mutual affection,&#xD;
and thus they lived happily together, surrounded by&#xD;
friends, and no~t forgetting to pay all kind attention&#xD;
to Ansaldo.&#xD;
&#xD;
THERE was in Siena, not many years ago, a young&#xD;
man, the son of respectable parents, named Mar-&#xD;
riotto Mignelli, who fell violently in love with a&#xD;
young lady by name. Gianozza, the daughter of one&#xD;
of the most respectable and worthy citizens, descend-&#xD;
ed from the family of the Saraceni; in the course of&#xD;
time his assiduity and constancy were returned by&#xD;
the lady with equal ardour. They, for some time,&#xD;
remained satisfied with the joys of reciprocal protes-&#xD;
tations, and the sight of each other alone was a bless-&#xD;
ing beyond their most ardent wishes,-but this last-&#xD;
ed but a short time; in what manner they should&#xD;
proceed to complete their views of happiness they&#xD;
could riot devise, knowing the repulse they should&#xD;
meet from the parents of the lady. At last Gianozza,&#xD;
who was as prudent as she was handsome, resolved on&#xD;
secretly being married to him, and thus, should they&#xD;
he detected, to sanction their secret intrigue under&#xD;
the cloak of a marriage. In order to accomplish this&#xD;
object, they bribed an Augustin friar, by whose&#xD;
means they were united. Having, for a time, enjoy&#xD;
ed the fruits of this sly, and partly unlawful mar&#xD;
riage, it happened that fortune, contrary to theim&#xD;
expectations, turned all their joys to bitter sorrow&#xD;
Marriotto one day coming to high words with a res-&#xD;
p3ctable citizen, blows ensued, and Marriotto unfor-&#xD;
tunately struck the man a ~vere blow with his stick&#xD;
on the head, of which the unhappy man died a few&#xD;
days after: Marriotto, therefore, carefully concealed&#xD;
himself. As the sbirri, who were sent in quest of&#xD;
him, could not find him, he was outlawed by the&#xD;

pression they never should meet again, would have&#xD;
melted the heart of a stone; and, in their last cm&#xD;
brace, they both seeme(l expiring in each oilier's&#xD;
arms. At length Marriotto tried to comfort his&#xD;
mournful bride, by intimating a hope that, by some&#xD;
fortunate event, he might return to his country. He,&#xD;
at last, determined not only to absent himself from&#xD;
Tuscany, but to fly from Italy altogether, and go&#xD;
over to Alexandria to an uncle, named Mignanelli,&#xD;
he had there, a great merchant. After settling with&#xD;
his wife on the best iuean~ of carrying on a corres-&#xD;
pondence between them, the unhappy Coul)le parted&#xD;
in tears. The distracted Marriotto made his way&#xD;
to the nearest port, to set sail foi' Alexandria, after&#xD;
leaving a letter forzhis brother, to inform him of the&#xD;
whole secret. He most pressingly entreated him&#xD;
carefully to watch over the safety of his dear Gia-&#xD;
nozza, and to protect her. In due time he arrived&#xD;
at Alexandria, was kindly receive(l by his uncle, and&#xD;
related his misfortunes to him; Mignanelli was much&#xD;
grieved, not so much at the murder of the man, as on&#xD;
account of the offence given to the relations of the&#xD;
lady by this secret union, and whose power was much&#xD;
to be dreaded; but thinking it was useless to re-&#xD;
1)roach him for things past, they endeavoured to quiet&#xD;
each other's minds. The uncle initiated him in&#xD;
trade, and having every month lettei~s constantly&#xD;
from his beloved Gianozza, and now and then seeing&#xD;
his brother, he was comparatively happy. In the&#xD;
interim, the father of Gianozza being solicited and&#xD;
importuned by many to marry his daughter, she con-&#xD;
tinually objected to one, then to another; being at&#xD;
last pressed by her father to choose a husband, and,&#xD;
in such a manner, that it would Jiave been needless&#xD;
to resist, she became almost distracted; to tell the&#xD;
164&#xD;
&#xD;
~&#xD;
&#xD;
truth would have but added fuel to fire. In t1~is&#xD;
dreadful situation, a thought struck her, not only&#xD;
dangerous and cruel, but, perhaps, never yet heard&#xD;
of. She told her father she was ready to obey his&#xD;
commands, and immediately went to the friar Au&#xD;
gustin, who had favoured their scheme, and cautious-&#xD;
ly imparted to him her project, and entreated his&#xD;
assistance; upon which he assumed that modest cau-&#xD;
tion and timidity natural to the cloth, and, by some,&#xD;
highly admired; and hamm'd and hah'd, but the en-&#xD;
chanting powers of a well lined purse soon embold-&#xD;
ened him, and he manfully entered into the scheme.&#xD;
He hastened home and made up (for he was an&#xD;
adept in the science) a draught, that not only would&#xD;
send a person to sleep for three days, but would give&#xD;
the real appearance of a corpse; having made up&#xD;
this draught he sent it to the lady, with proper di-&#xD;
rections. Gianozza wrote a letter to Marriotto, to&#xD;
inform him of every particular the friar had done by&#xD;
her express command; then swallowed the draught,&#xD;
which, in a short time, thriw her into a stupor, and&#xD;
she fell as if dead amidst her women; their cries soon&#xD;
brought her father and all the family into the room;&#xD;
the distracted old man sent for medical assistance,&#xD;
but nothing could avail; she was to all appearance&#xD;
dead, and the doctors were of opinion it was from&#xD;
the gout that had seized the chest. The next day&#xD;
and the succeeding one, she was carefully watch&amp;amp;i,&#xD;
to see if any signs of' life appeared, but none being&#xD;
visible, to the great grief of her aged parent, arLd&#xD;
amidst the tears and lamentations of friends and re~&#xD;
nations, she was buried in the church of St. Augus-&#xD;
tin. About midnight, the friar, assisted by one of&#xD;
his trusty brethren, took her out of the coffin into his&#xD;
room, and at the hour when the operatiowof th~&#xD;
draught must be nearly over, they, by friction ~and&#xD;
other means, restore~i her to life. Being completely&#xD;
revived to sense arid feeling in a few days, dressed&#xD;
in a friar's garment, she set tbrth with the Augustin&#xD;
friar to port Pisano, where they found the galley&#xD;

and merchant vessels are often detained by landing,&#xD;
or freighting goods, contrary winds, and other casu-&#xD;
allies, they did not arrive till some months later than&#xD;
they expected. T he unfortunate Marriotto had,&#xD;
however, received, by several merchants, letters from&#xD;
Gorgano his brother, who anxious to keep u~~ the cor-&#xD;
respondence he had promised, had written to him&#xD;
every particular of the melancholy event, adding,&#xD;
that the afflicted and broken-hearted old father had&#xD;
died with grief. On the other hand, the vessel by&#xD;
which Gianozza's letter had been sent was carrying&#xD;
corn to Alexandria, and was taken by pirates. Hav-&#xD;

if thou hast a heart, 17116u wilt easily picture to thy-&#xD;
self the distraction of Marriotto; so overpowering&#xD;
were his sorrows, that he determined not to outlive&#xD;
hi~ misfortune, and in spite of his uncle's entreaties,&#xD;
he resolved to return to Siena, to conceal himself in&#xD;
~disguise, and there, where he thought his dear Gia-&#xD;
nozza lay, to bathe her tomb with his tears, and die.&#xD;
He embarked in a Venetian galley that was sailing&#xD;
to Naples; being arrived there, he went by land into&#xD;
Tuscany entered Siena unknown, in a pilgrim's dress,&#xD;
and without going to any of his relations, went to the&#xD;
church of St. Augustin, where his beloved had been&#xD;
buried; there he wept and lamented, and would fain&#xD;
have buried himself with her in the tomb. The fol-&#xD;
lowing evening he provided himself~with an iron tool&#xD;
and wrench, and had nearly succeeded in opening&#xD;
the tomb, when the sexton, who was come to ring&#xD;
the bell for midnight prayers, hearing a noise, tiast-&#xD;
ened to the place, and found the unfortunate Mar-&#xD;
riotto bard at his work; taking him to ~e a robber&#xD;

shirts; and although he was in tatters, he was imxne.&#xD;
diately recognized to be Marriotto Mignelli. Here&#xD;
he was kept fast till the morning. It was soon di-&#xD;
1~111ge(l in Siena, and reaching the ears of the ma~i~&#xD;
rates, they instantly sent the shirri to sieze him.&#xD;
They brought him before the judge, and he had&#xD;
scarcely felt the first torture, when he confessed~&#xD;
rather than endure more torments, the cause of his&#xD;
desperate resolution to return home. Although he&#xD;
was universally pitied, and more particularly by the&#xD;
fait' sex, who looked upon him as a phenomenon of&#xD;
true love, and wept bitterly for his fate, yet the ma-&#xD;
gistrate ordered that on the first execution day he&#xD;
should be hung. Thus, the interposition of his friends&#xD;
being unavailing, he. submitted to his fate. After&#xD;
some months had elapsed, Gianozza, and her con-&#xD;
ductor arrived, after great sufferings, at Alexandria,&#xD;
enquirecl for NiccoloMignanelh, and having found&#xD;
him, made herself known to him, and told him all her&#xD;
misfortunes, and the purpose of her voyage. The&#xD;
good uncle was petrified with amazement, and griev-&#xD;
ed to the heart. After he had made her take her&#xD;
usual woman's garments, and kindly treated the&#xD;
friar, he then related to the distressed Gianozza how&#xD;
Marriotto. led away by despair, had left him5 and&#xD;
had gone back, without giving him the least intima-&#xD;
tion, fully determined to die, and how much he had&#xD;
grieved at his departure, knowing that such was his&#xD;
fixed resolve. Reader, you will surely conceive that&#xD;
this last misfortune outweighed every past suffering,&#xD;
and almost overwhelmed the unfortunate widow.&#xD;
After the bitterness of her sorrow was alleviated by&#xD;
scorching tears, Niccolo advised that they should&#xD;
both immediately take shipping, go to Siena, and&#xD;
find out Marriotto, dead or alive, and use every&#xD;
means to clear the honour of the lady. Having set-&#xD;
tled some little business, he made her take men's&#xD;
clothes, embarked her, and after a prosperous voy-&#xD;
age they arrived at Leghorn, and went from thence&#xD;
as speedily as they could, to a little estate near Siena,&#xD;

could no longer flow; death and despair were indeli-&#xD;

in the corner of his left eye-which he, somehow or&#xD;
other, omitted to wipe away.&#xD;
When she saw me, an' please your Ho~&#xD;
nour-continued Trim-she pointed at me, then hid&#xD;
her head on the necks of her little ones..-'-What&#xD;
could be the meaning of that, Trim?-quoth my&#xD;
uncle Toby-.&#xD;
An' please your Honour, I went up to her, and&#xD;
told her I was a friend,-that I could not bear&#xD;
to see innocence, as she appeared to be, in distress,&#xD;
without offering her succour,--that I was a soldier&#xD;
.-and that the duty of a soldier was to protect the&#xD;
unfortunate.-&#xD;
That was gallantly said, Trim-quoth my uncle&#xD;
Toby.&#xD;
An' please your Honour-when I mentioned the&#xD;
name of a soldier, she rose up her head.,-pointed at&#xD;
my uniform,-shriek'd,-and sunk between her in-&#xD;
fants, who crawled upon her, ~nd smiled An'&#xD;
p lease your Honour, their smiles made my heart&#xD;
bleed ;--..--.-----When she came to herself, she thank~&#xD;
ed me for my care. I took out what little I had&#xD;
in my pocket, and offered it to her&#xD;
Thou art a generous soul, Trim,-quoth my&#xD;
uncle Toby. -An' p lease your Honour.-quoth&#xD;
Trim, bowing to my uncle Toby,-if ever I exercise&#xD;
generosity-it is your Honour who has trained me&#xD;
to it, and given me the example.&#xD;
My uncle Toby seemed to feel that sensation-&#xD;
which a modest consciousness of merit often colours&#xD;
the cheek with.&#xD;
Trim continued-What money can bring back&#xD;
my poor EDWARD !-said she, sobbing;-he was kill-&#xD;
ed in Flanders!&#xD;
If it was not for the glory, Trim-quoth my uncle&#xD;
roby-I could almost wish I had never been a sob&#xD;

An' please your Honour, I told her that the money&#xD;
would be of service to supply her children.-...&#xD;
A little provided them-she replied-She hoped that&#xD;
GOD would guard her sweet babes :-As for herself&#xD;
she said, she had drank but a little water, and eaten&#xD;

I loved her, and every thing about her; but&#xD;
my heart was wrung at her affliction.&#xD;
This little piece of ground-said she-Was well cul~&#xD;
tivated;-it was the pride of EDXV ARD~ and the pride&#xD;
of myself-it is a ruin now !-the weeds already&#xD;
begin t6 cover it. We have been fed by our&#xD;
neighbours, Mit. Trim-said she-as well as they&#xD;
could afford it-ever since EDWARD was stolen from&#xD;
me:-he was beloved by them all; they feel for&#xD;
his wife and children: he was good nature;&#xD;
and the artful took advantage of it;-it was his&#xD;
feeling heart that won mine-I saw him hazard&#xD;
his life, to save the nest of a sparrow I loved&#xD;
him for it !-and although I was superior to him&#xD;
in birth and education-(his heart was better than&#xD;
riches, Mr. Trirn,)-I quitted my father's house;&#xD;
and we were married. My father has nut&#xD;
seen me from that time--he will not own me,-said&#xD;
she, wiping her tears away. He must have a&#xD;
hard heart-said I.-&#xD;
- An' so he must, and please your Honour-&#xD;
for a man that would not give his child the best&#xD;
quarters-although it may have neglected a small&#xD;

There is something about rustic benevolence,&#xD;

of tliousantls towards raising an hospital. How&#xD;
can I account for this ?-[s it that in the latter case&#xD;
doubt hangs so heavy upon my affections, as to&#xD;
Ward their motion? for vanity so often usury~s&#xD;
the place of real humanity, that it would puzzle ~a-&#xD;

of' honesty, with which the rustic acts, that tunes my&#xD;
frame to a more pleasing harmony. The gene~-&#xD;

disown it.&#xD;

Then he ha~ no duty to 1)eriorrfl in this world-&#xD;

we might very ~vell dispense with his post&#xD;
So do I, Trim, said my uncle Toby.&#xD;
I did not inform your Honour-said r[ri1n~f the&#xD;
letter that Anna received from Flanders.&#xD;
Poor Anna trembled       the stream of sorrow&#xD;
was not dried up -she wiped the tear from her&#xD;
cheek-another came-she WipC(l that away too;&#xD;
~-still another supplied its place. Surely&#xD;
such perseverence argues some right, real or sup-&#xD;
posed. She took a letter from her bosom-that&#xD;
was not the one !-she kissed and lodged it there&#xD;
again. She then took the other from her pock.&#xD;
et. and handed it to trim.-The corporal, with&#xD;
due military obedience, raised his right hand, plac-&#xD;
ing the back of it, so as to be rather above parallel&#xD;
with his forehead, and with the left, delivered the&#xD;
letter to my uncle Toby.&#xD;
______ At the time the old man entered, to bring&#xD;
his contribution towards the subsistence of Anna&#xD;
and her children, Anna was weeping over the fatal&#xD;
letter she had received from Edward.&#xD;
rrhere are moments when grief is so bashful,&#xD;
that she loves, not only to hide her tears, but even&#xD;
the very cause of them; this was one of those&#xD;
rnoments.----As the old man entered, she hastily&#xD;
dried her eyes, and as hastily deposited the letter iii&#xD;
herbosom.&#xD;
The following was the letter from Flanders:&#xD;

"how many a night have Edward and myself shed&#xD;

I Thall never see them again, .James!" h6d say.&#xD;
then turn his head from me, and weep like a child&#xD;
-.~"I wish I had been killed instead of him! He&#xD;
bade me send to you, the enclosed little locket, which&#xD;
you gave him, (as he told me) for his kindness £3&#xD;

dressed his wounds; about eight hours after, he&#xD;

been! What a shame! They look more&#xD;
cool here, in killing men, and seeing blood shed.-&#xD;
than we do in the country when we kill the insects&#xD;

Had nature 1)laced speech in her heart, she could&#xD;
not have spoken with more sincerity.&#xD;
The looks of Trim, and of my uncle Tohy, ac~&#xD;
knoiviedged it and answered her; " Thy&#xD;
thanks have cancelled the obligation that thou&#xD;
owedst unto us,-if fellow feeling, which we natu~&#xD;
rally owe to each other, may be thus accounted an&#xD;
obligation."&#xD;
______ Give me the other letter, Anna, said my&#xD;
uncle Toby, in the modulation of tenderness,-I&#xD;
have a use'for it-and I hope for thy happiness.&#xD;
Anna drew the letter slowly from her bosom,-&#xD;
it was a hard trial! it was parting with the dear-&#xD;
est]con)panion she had, except her children:&#xD;
but gratitude whispered in her ear-" Thy bene-&#xD;
factor asks it !" Here it is-said Anna, with&#xD;
the most patient sweetness.&#xD;
My uncle Toby folded up the letters in a blank&#xD;
covers which he had prepared before he set out;&#xD;
-it was his intention, to have sent the one that&#xD;
Trim had repeated to him, to Anna's father.-&#xD;
lie thought there was strength sufficient in that;&#xD;
but such a reinforcement as the. one from&#xD;
Flanders!-aud the expedition to be conducted&#xD;
by1   m, too !-it couldn't fail.--&#xD;
not advance a line-said my uncle Toby, as&#xD;
he in closed the letters-there. is force enough-&#xD;
quoth he,-to take the strongest fortress that was&#xD;
ever garrisoned by anger or revenge.   I'll not&#xD;
write a word in it!&#xD;

Trim took a pen from a little case, which&#xD;
he drew from his pocket, and, dipping it in the ink,&#xD;
gave it. to Anna.-~--Arina took the pen-her&#xD;
lips grew pale-her hand trembled:-Tie will&#xD;

As she finished the direction, a drop-as (:lear and&#xD;
spotless as the eye of innocence ever shed-fell on&#xD;
it;-z-~.-it would have done honour to the brightest&#xD;

Anna,-I will be as a father to you, and to your chil-&#xD;

The landlord of Anna's cottage, was, fortunately,&#xD;
unlike the common run of those beings:-she owed&#xD;
her rent ;-she was welcome to owe it!--&#xD;
My uncle Toby, at parting, tepderly kissed the&#xD;
children;-the tears were in his eyes. He&#xD;
gave Anna-first his hand, and then his purse:-&#xD;
she received them both with that timid modesty,-.&#xD;
which a delicate mind commonly accepts with.&#xD;
Anna locked the door of her cottage-she fled&#xD;

anna was honest, too, amidst all her sorrows.-&#xD;

firm tone of voice-you may starve him out&#xD;

Had my uncle Toby, at the head of a brave le-&#xD;

"Served him right !"-said he.-1 suppose, your&#xD;

cheeks worn,-his forehead cloudy and wrinkled,&#xD;
---his body wasted-.------&#xD;
-- It is his conscience that preys upon him,&#xD;
Trim,-quoth my uncle rI~oby&#xD;
- An' please your Honour-replied Trim-I do&#xD;
not think he has one;-he looks like one of those&#xD;
soldiers who doesn't fight for the sake of a good&#xD;
cause, your Honour,-but for the plunder he ex-&#xD;
pects afterwards. His hair is~a1most white.&#xD;
His actions are a disgrace to his head,&#xD;
Trim !-said my uncle Toby.&#xD;
An' please your Honour-quoth Trim-he has no&#xD;
more feeling in his heart than a bullet.&#xD;
-- Then we must be fathers to the father-&#xD;
Iess, Trim-quoth my uncle Toby. I am sorry&#xD;
you returned his fire, Trim !-it is noble to be a&#xD;
faithful ally-but it is wise to lie a peaceable one&#xD;
also.-&#xD;
At this moment a messenger entered the room.-&#xD;
It was from Anna's father;-he had burst a blood&#xD;
vessel, in the violence of his passion, which continu-&#xD;
ed afte~' Trim had left him He wished to see&#xD;
Anna, and the corporal.-I called for Anna-said&#xD;
the messenger, and she directed me here. Her&#xD;
father wishes to see her, and the soldier he offended.&#xD;
-----------I fear he will not be long in this world !--&#xD;
Advance, Trim,-quoth my uncle Toby-and&#xD;
give all the succour you are able. An' please&#xD;

Trim, though fatigued, remembered he was going&#xD;
upon duty;'-his knee pained him,-but the light-&#xD;
ness of his conscience made his steps easy !-&#xD;
As Trim departed, my uncle Toby and he ex-&#xD;
changed something like a congratulatory look.-&#xD;
rhey had made overtures for peace, but were re~&#xD;
fused; the enemy to sue in turn-it was glo-&#xD;
rious !-But my uncle Toby and Trim loved peace&#xD;
too sincerely to trifle with the feelings of the enemy.&#xD;
My uncle Toby now filled another pipe.--Sus-&#xD;
pense lengthened the pauses between each whiff,-&#xD;
while fancy painted to his imagination, Trim enter-&#xD;
ing-the olive-branch and the laurel budding on his&#xD;
brow-&#xD;
- There was something of an April cast in the&#xD;
countenance of my uncle Toby;-for, although a&#xD;
sunshine settled on it, still a few ~iight clouds kept&#xD;
continually passing it: these were but thin&#xD;
shades of uncertainty crossing hope.&#xD;
The sun was now going down.-As the day&#xD;
beam waned, my uncle Toby's impatience increas-&#xD;
ed; his eves were ever and anon fixed on the&#xD;
lock of the door. He rose up-walked-sat down&#xD;
-rose up---went to the windoiv;-and it was not&#xD;
till the ruddy light was sunk half way in the bowl&#xD;
of his second pipe, that rp rim returned.--&#xD;
XAThen Trim entered, there was such an expres-.&#xD;
sive melancholy pictured on his visage,-that had&#xD;
cheerfulness met him in her way, the smile had fled&#xD;
from her cheek, and she had become the sister of sor-&#xD;
row!&#xD;
My uncle Toby immediately rose from his chair.&#xD;
*     What! Trim-~~~quoth he, in a low tone of mo-&#xD;
notonous despondency--Have we lost the day again?&#xD;

face of her father, an' please your Honour, was the&#xD;
face of a stranger !-she threw her arms round his&#xD;

AN ACCOUNT OF THE GREENLAND WHALE.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE whale, when full grown, is from 50 to 65 feet&#xD;
in length, and from SO to 40 in circumference, im-&#xD;
mediately before the fins.* It is thickest a little be-&#xD;
hind the fins, and from thence gradually tapers&#xD;
towards the tail, and slightly towards the neck. It&#xD;
is cylindrical from the neck until near about the&#xD;
junction of the tail and body, where it becomes&#xD;
ridged.&#xD;
The head has a triangular shape. The bones of&#xD;
the head are very porous, and full of a fine kind of&#xD;
oil. When the oil is drained out, the bone is so&#xD;
light as to swim in water. The jaw bones, the most&#xD;
striking portions of the head are from 20 to 25 feet&#xD;
in length, are curved, and the space between them&#xD;
is 9 or 10 feet, by IS or 20. They give shape to the&#xD;
under part of the head, which is almost perfectly&#xD;
flat, and is about 20 feet in length, by 12 in breadth.&#xD;
The tongue is of great size, and yields a ton or&#xD;
more of oil. The lips, which are at right angles to&#xD;
the flat part of the base of the head, are firm and&#xD;
hard, and yield about two tons of oil.&#xD;
~ It is said, that the whale was formerly much larger than~ it&#xD;
is at present, being sometimes 100 or 120 feet long: but the ac-&#xD;
curacy of this statement is to be questioned; for the largest I&#xD;
ever heard of being caught did not exceed 70 feet in length; and&#xD;
this was reckoned a very uncommon individual. Of about 200.&#xD;
which I have seen taken, not one measured 65 feet in length, al.&#xD;
houg1~ many of them were fu1l grown.&#xD;
154&#xD;
&#xD;
1~,   V&#xD;
&#xD;
To the upper jaw is attached the substance call-&#xD;
ed whalebone, which is straight in some individuals,&#xD;
and in others convex. The lamina~, or blades, are&#xD;
not all of equal length; neither are the largest exact-&#xD;
lv in the mifidle of the series, but somewhat nearer&#xD;
the throat; from this point they before gradually&#xD;
shorter each way. In each side of the mouth are&#xD;
about ~00 laniina~ of whalebone. They are no~&#xD;
j)erIectly flat; for besides the longitudinal curva-&#xD;
ture alarea(]y mentioned, they are curved transverse-&#xD;
hr. TI largest lamin~e are frQm ten to fourteen feet&#xD;
in length, very rarely fifteen feet in length. The&#xD;
1)readth of the largest, at the thick ends, or where&#xD;
they are attached to the jaw, is about a Ibot. The&#xD;
Greenland fishers estimate the size of the whale~by&#xD;
the length of the whalebone: where the whalebone&#xD;
is six feet long, the whale is said to be a size fish. In&#xD;
suckers, or young whales, still under the protection&#xD;
of the mother, the whalebone is only a few inches&#xD;
long. The whalebone is immediately covered by&#xD;
the two under lips, the edges of which, when the&#xD;
mouth is shut, overlap the upper part, in a squa-&#xD;
mous manner.&#xD;
On the upper part of the head, there is a double&#xD;
oj)ening, called the spout-holes, or blow-holes. Their&#xD;
external orifices are like two slits, which donot l~&#xD;
parallel, but form an acute angle with each other.&#xD;
Through these openings the animal breathes.&#xD;
The eyes are very small, not larger than those of&#xD;
an ox; yet the whale appears to be quick of sight.&#xD;
rihey are situated about a foot above where the&#xD;
upper and under lips join.&#xD;
In the whale, the sense of hearing seems to be&#xD;
rather obtuse.&#xD;
The throat is so narrow, as scarcely to admit a&#xD;
hen's egg.&#xD;
The fins are from 4 to 5 feet broad, and S or 10&#xD;
"ect long, and seem only to be used in bearingoff&#xD;
their young, in turning, and giving a direction to&#xD;
the velocity produced by the tail,&#xD;

THE. WHALE.&#xD;
&#xD;
The tail is horizontal' from S~0 to 30 feet in&#xD;
breadth, indented in the middle, and the two lobes&#xD;
pointed and turned outwards. In it lies the whole&#xD;
strength of the animal. By means of the tail, the&#xD;
whale advances itself in the water, with greater or&#xD;
less rapidity: if the motion is slow, the tail cuts the&#xD;
water obliquely, like forcing a boat forward by the&#xD;
operation of skulling; but if the motion is very rapid,&#xD;
it is effected by an undulating mcition of the rump.&#xD;
The skin in some whales is smooth and shining;&#xD;
in others, it is furrowed, like the water-lines in laid&#xD;
paper, but coarser..&#xD;
The colour is black, grey, and white, and a tinge&#xD;
of yellow about the lower parts of the head. The&#xD;
back, upper part of the head, most of the belly, the&#xD;
fins, tail, and part of the under jaw, are deep black.&#xD;
The fore part of the under jaw, and a little of the&#xD;
belly, are white, and the junction of the tail with the&#xD;
body, grey. Such are the common colours of the&#xD;
adult whale. I have seen piebald whales. Such&#xD;
whales as are below size, are almost entirely of a&#xD;
blueish-black colour. The skin of suckers is of&#xD;
a pale blaeish colour. The cuticle, or scarf-skin, is&#xD;
no thicker than parchment; the trUe skin is from&#xD;
three-fourths to an inch in thickness all over the&#xD;
body.&#xD;
Immediately beneath the skin lies the blubber, or&#xD;
fat, from 10 to ~i0 inches in thickness, varying in&#xD;
different parts of' the body, as well as in different&#xD;
individuals. The colour, also, is not always the&#xD;
same, being white, red, and yellow; and it also iTa-&#xD;
ries in. denseness. It is principally for the blubber&#xD;
that the Greenland fishery is carried on. It is cut&#xD;
from the body in large lumps, and carried on board&#xD;
the ship, and then cut into smaller pieces. The&#xD;
fleshy parts and skinconnected with the blubber, are,&#xD;
next separated from it, and it is again cut into such&#xD;
pieces as will admit of its being passed into casks by&#xD;
the bun g-holc, which is only three or four inches in&#xD;
diameter. In these casks it is conveyed home&#xD;

t&#xD;
&#xD;
where it is boiled in vessels capable of containing&#xD;
from three to six tons, for the purpose of extracting&#xD;
the oil from the fritters, which are tend inous fibres,&#xD;
running in various directions, and containing the&#xD;
oil, or rather connecting together the cellular sub-&#xD;
stance which contains it. These fibres are finest&#xD;
next the skin, thinnest in the middle, and coarsest&#xD;
near the flesh.&#xD;
The blubber of a sucker, when very young, fre-&#xD;
quently contains litde or no oil, but only a kind of&#xD;
milky fluid; in which case, when the animal is de.&#xD;
proved of life, the body sinks to the bottom, as also&#xD;
does the blubber when separated from it; while the&#xD;
body and blubber of larger individuals always swim.&#xD;
The flesh of the young whale is of a fine red colour;&#xD;
that of the old approaches to black, and is coarse,&#xD;
like that of a bull, and is said to be dry and sean&#xD;
when boiled~ because there is but little fat inter-&#xD;
mixed with the flesh.&#xD;
The food of the whale is generally sul)posed to&#xD;
consist of different kinds of sepi~, medusse, or the&#xD;
cijo limacina of Lin~us; but I hive great reason to&#xD;
believe, that it is chiefly, if not altogether, of the&#xD;
sqidll~ or shrimp tribe; for, on examining the stom-&#xD;
ach of one of large size, nothing else was ibund in it;&#xD;
tlmy were about half an inch long, semi-transparent,&#xD;
and of a pale red colour. I also found a great&#xD;
quantity in the mouth of another, having been appa-&#xD;
rently vomited by it. When the whale feeds, it&#xD;
swims with considerable velocity under water, with&#xD;
its mouth wide open: the water enters by the fore-&#xD;
j~art, but is poured out again at the sides, and the&#xD;
food is entangled and sifted, as it were, by the&#xD;
whalebonewhich does not allow any thing to escape.&#xD;
It seldom remains longer below the surface than&#xD;
twenty or thirty minutes: when it comes up again&#xD;
to blow, it will perhaps remain ten, twenty or thirty&#xD;
minutes at the surface of the water, when nothing,&#xD;
disturbs it. In calm weather, it sometimes sleeps in&#xD;
this situation. It sometimes ascends with so much&#xD;

&#xD;
force, as to leap entirely out of the water. 'When&#xD;
swimming at its greatest velocity, it moves at the&#xD;
rate of seven to nine miles an hour.&#xD;
Its maternal affection deserves notice. The young&#xD;
one is frequently struck for the sake of its mother,&#xD;
which will soon come up close by it, encourage it to&#xD;
swim off, assist it, by taking it under its fin, and sel-&#xD;
dom deserts it while life remains. It is then very&#xD;
dangerous to approach, as she loses all regard for&#xD;
her own safety in anxiety for the preservation of her&#xD;
cub, dashing about most violently, and not dreading&#xD;
to rise even amidst the, boats. Except, however,&#xD;
when the whale has young to protect, the male is in&#xD;
general more active and dangerous than the female,&#xD;
especially males of about nine feet bone.&#xD;
The principal enemies of the whale, are the&#xD;
swordl-fish and thrasher. It is probable that the&#xD;
shark is also an enemy to the whale, for it attacks&#xD;
the dead carcase; and the whale is seen to fly those&#xD;
quarters of the sea where the shark abounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE B3EE HUNTER.&#xD;
&#xD;
AFTER I have done sowing, by way of recreation 1&#xD;
prepare for a week's jaunt in the woods, not to hunt&#xD;
either the deer or the bears, as my neighbours (10,&#xD;
but to catch the more harmless bees. I cannot boast&#xD;
that this chase is so noble or -so famous among men,&#xD;
but I find it less fatiguing, and full as profitable; and&#xD;
the last consideration is the only one that moves mec&#xD;
I take with me my dog, as a-companion, for he is&#xD;
useless as to this game; my gun, for no man, you&#xD;
know, ought to enter the woods without one; my&#xD;
blanket, some provisions, some wax, vermilion, ho.&#xD;
ney, and a small pocket compass. With these imple.&#xD;
ments I proceed to such woods as are at a con siderble&#xD;
distance from any settlements. I carefully examine&#xD;
whether they abound with large4 treeCs; if so, I make&#xD;
1*88&#xD;
&#xD;
4 (&#xD;
&#xD;
a small fil e on some flat stones, in a convenient place&#xD;
On the fire I put some wax; close by this fire, ont&#xD;
another stone, I drop honey in distinct drops, which&#xD;
I surround with small quantities of vermilion, laid&#xD;
on the stone; and then I retire carefully to watch&#xD;
whether any bees appear. .If there are ~any in that&#xD;
neighbourhood, I rest assured that the smell of the&#xD;
burnt wax will unavoidably attract them. ~They&#xD;
will soon find out the honey, for they are fond of&#xD;
preying on that which is not their own; and in their&#xD;
approach they necessarily tinge themselves with&#xD;
some particles of vermillion, which will long adhere&#xD;
to their bodies. I next fix my compass, to find out&#xD;
their course, which they keep invariably strait, when&#xD;
they are returning home loaded. By the assistance&#xD;
of my watch, I observe how long those are returning&#xD;
which are marked with vermilion. Thus possessed&#xD;
of the course, and, in some measure, of the distance,&#xD;
which I can easily guess at, I follow the first and&#xD;
seldom fail of coming to that tree where those repub-&#xD;
lics are lodged: I then mark it; andl thus, with pa-&#xD;
tience, I have found out sometimes eleven swarms in&#xD;
a season! and it is inconceivable what a quantity of&#xD;
honey these trees will sometimes afford. It entirely&#xD;
depends on the size of the hollow, as the bees never&#xD;
rest, nor swarm, till it is all replenished; for, like&#xD;
me~n, it is only the want of room that induces them&#xD;
to quit the maternal hive. Next, I proceed to some&#xD;
of the nearest settlements, where I procure proper&#xD;
assistance to cut down the trees, get all my prey se-&#xD;
cured, and then return home with my prize. Trhe&#xD;
first bees I ever procured were thus found in the&#xD;
woods by mere accident, for at this time I had no&#xD;
kind of skill in this method of tracing them. The&#xD;
body of the tree being perfectly sound, they had&#xD;
lodged the mselvs in the hollow of one of its principal&#xD;
limbs, which I carefully sawed off, and with a good&#xD;
deal of labour and industry brought it home, where&#xD;
fixed it up in the same position in which I found it&#xD;
wing. This was in April. I had live swarms&#xD;

FALLIBILITY OF HUMAN JUDGMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
A GENTLEMAN died possessed of a considerable&#xD;
fortune, which he left to his daughter, appointing&#xD;
his brother to be her guardian and the executor oi?&#xD;
his will; and, if the young lady (who wasthen about&#xD;
eighteen) happened to die unmarried, or, if married,&#xD;
without children, her fortune was to go to her guar-&#xD;
dian ~d his kin.&#xD;
Notwithstanding the objections of her other rela-&#xD;
tions, the uncle took her to his house near Eppin~&#xD;
Forest, whence she spon afterwards disappeared; afl(I&#xD;
inquiry being made, it was proved that she went out&#xD;
with her uncle one day, and that he returned with&#xD;
out her. He was, in consequence, taken into custo-&#xD;
dy, and, on examination, acknowledged that he did&#xD;
190&#xD;
&#xD;
go out with her, and said that she found means to loit-&#xD;
er behind as they were returning home, and therefore&#xD;
he knew not where she was, or what had become of&#xD;
her. This account, however, being thought im-&#xD;
probable, hewas detained in custody; when it was&#xD;
discovered that the young lady had been addressed&#xD;
by a gentleman, who, a few days before she was mis-&#xD;
sing, set out on a pretended journey to the north, she&#xD;
having declared that she would marry him on his re-&#xD;
turn; and that, her uncle having often expressed&#xD;
great disapprobation of the match, she had frequent-&#xD;
ly reproached him with unkindness, and an abuse&#xD;
of his power. A woman was also produced, who&#xD;
swore that on the day on which they went out, as she&#xD;
was coming through the forest about eleven o'clock&#xD;
in the forenoon, she heard a woman's voice say,&#xD;
Don't kill me, uncle; don't kill me; and, hearing the&#xD;
report of a gun immediately after, she made as&#xD;
fast as possible, but could not be easy in her mind till&#xD;
she had told what had happened. Upon this evidence,&#xD;
thegentleman was condemned and executed; and,&#xD;
in about ten days after his execution, the lady came&#xD;
home, and declared, that having previously agreed&#xD;
to go off with the gentleman, he had given out that&#xD;
he was going to the north, but that he had waited at&#xD;
a small house near the forest, where horses where&#xD;
ready for himself and her, as well as two servants who&#xD;
were also on horseback. That, as she walked with her&#xD;
uncle, he reproached her for persisting in her resolu-&#xD;
tion; and, after much altercation, she said, with&#xD;
some warmth, 1 have set my heart upon it: if I do&#xD;
not marry him, it will be my death-and, don't kill&#xD;
me, uncle; don't kill me. That just as she had utter-&#xD;
ed these words, a man shot a wood-pigeon; and that,&#xD;
coming near the appointed place, she let her uncle&#xD;
go on; and her suitor being ready, she mounted her&#xD;
horse and rode off to lodgings near 'Windsor, where&#xD;
they were married the same day, and, in about a&#xD;
week, ivent on a journey of pleasure to France,&#xD;
whence they were then returned.&#xD;

THIS afternoon, at B. J. 's, one of our company&#xD;
was a young woman, who was there on a visit. Her&#xD;
usual residence was in one of the new settlements,&#xD;
on the banks of the Ohio,, about 500 miles from Phi-&#xD;
ladelphia. She informed us that many families on&#xD;
the banks of this great riverare supplied with shop&#xD;
goods from'yessels which navigate it, and are fitted&#xD;
up with counters, shelves, and drawers, in the same&#xD;
manner as are shops on land, and well stored with&#xD;
all kinds of goods. As they sail along the river, on&#xD;
coming near a plantation, they blow a horn or conch&#xD;
to give notice of their arrival; when the plant-&#xD;
ers, with their wives and daughters, repair to these&#xD;
o4ng shops, and select such things as they are in&#xD;
waiit of; and make payment in the produce of their&#xD;
plantations, such as grain, flour, cotton, tobacco,&#xD;
dried venison, the skins of wild animals, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
The shopkeeper, having disposed of his goods in this&#xD;
way, returns home with the produce he has collect-&#xD;
ed; and again renews his stock, and proceeds on&#xD;
another voyage. The young woman remarked, that&#xD;
four or five of these floating shops would pass by her&#xD;
father's house in the course of a day. /&#xD;
She likewise informed us, that (such was the pri-&#xD;
mitive simplicity in which they lived) it was a very&#xD;
unusual thing to have locks to their doors; a~d that,&#xD;
when more strangers called upon them than they had&#xD;
beds to accommodate them with, it was customary&#xD;
for the family to spread temporary beds upon the&#xD;
floor, on which they passedAhe night, leaving their&#xD;
own to the strangers.&#xD;

Tnis extraordinary character was born near the&#xD;
city of Worcester, in England; the date or time of&#xD;
his birth could never be exactly ascertained, or&#xD;
whom his parents were, as nothing remarkable re-&#xD;
specting them could ever be found out, from himself&#xD;
or by his biographer. Suffice it to say, his own sin~&#xD;
gular habits, his singular appearance, his singular&#xD;
mode of living, his singular death, and, above aJI, the&#xD;
singular and extraordinary sums of money, and&#xD;
other valuables,, found concealed, in and about his&#xD;
dungeon, (for We can call the place of his abode no-&#xD;
thing else,) has caused persons, from a remote part&#xD;
of the country, to come, from curiosity, to view it.&#xD;
Jemmy Jenkins' conduct was regulated by two or&#xD;
three very simple notior~s. Bread, thought he, is&#xD;
bread; cheese is cheese; but money is bread and&#xD;
cheese too. A house is a house, and a field is a field,&#xD;
but money is both, and therefore better than either;&#xD;
so I will keep my money; for if I exchange, said he~&#xD;
my money for these, they will have letter than me;&#xD;
therefore, the best of the bargain. Jemmy Jenkins,&#xD;
however, forgot that money was neither bread nor&#xD;
cheese, whilst he kept it, and that its only value&#xD;
consists in its being exchanged for the commodities&#xD;
of life: but this doctrine he thought unwise. Also,&#xD;
Jemmy Jenkins cared for nobody but himself, and&#xD;
nobody cared for Jemmy Jenkins.&#xD;
his dwelling, which he held on the same terms as&#xD;
the sand-martins or rabbits, his only ne~ighbours, was&#xD;
something between a hermitage and a hog-stye, yet&#xD;

was not to be compared to either: for though it cx&#xD;
hibited the poverty of the first, was not eveki aq&#xD;
cleanly as the latter. And like most oilier misers,&#xD;
had also the appellat ion of being a woman-hat cii: for&#xD;
not one of the sex was he ever known to address,&#xD;
either in 1~ublic or private life. Even the males who&#xD;
resided in the neighbour hood where he lived, founo&#xD;
it peculiar~ hard to engage him in conversation ot&#xD;
any kind, and the contemptuous appearance of his&#xD;
hovel, rendered any depredation on it or him as use~&#xD;
less; s5 that most persons supposed that h~ existed&#xD;
on charity, vet those that partially knew him, never&#xD;
knew him ask alms of any one. How he acquired&#xD;
his wealth, to this hour, is inexplicable.&#xD;
His hovel was situated at the bottom of a sand pit,&#xD;
or forsaken gravel-hole. It could only be distin-&#xD;
guished from the abode of some burrowing quadru-&#xD;
ped, by a few massy logs, which formed a barricade&#xD;
at the entrance, with some straw and peat, which&#xD;
kept out the sun and rain. What the interior con-&#xD;
tained, that, he was singularly cautious, no one but&#xD;
himself, during his life-time should know.&#xD;
Here he maintained undisputed possession, for&#xD;
many years, rarely observed, and never molested;&#xD;
for he who could feel no apprehensions from super-&#xD;
natual appearances, in s~ich a situation, was, by&#xD;
the common people reckoned among them ;and,&#xD;
therefore, his residence, after sui~xset, was as care-&#xD;
fully avoided as the-church-yard itself.&#xD;
Within a short distance of this odd man's retreat&#xD;
there stood the venerable and dignified remains of&#xD;
a budding that had been erected at a very remote&#xD;
period. From the extent of its remains, it is more&#xD;
than probable it had been a j)lace of considerable&#xD;
consequence, as a religious establishment, up to the&#xD;
period of the E~eformation. through this ruin, old&#xD;
Jenkins used to pass to a small market town, not&#xD;
f~,r distant, to purchase a fliw of the absolute neces-&#xD;

regularly to part the entangled herhage, to I'emovo&#xD;
with his hands every thing which came in his w~ty&#xD;

fully remar ~ed the spot, that on the morrow he might&#xD;
renew it with redoubled vigor.&#xD;
Just as he arose to begone, and nearly on the same&#xD;
path way or passage, as he turne(l an angle of the&#xD;
building, within a few yards of which he had been&#xD;
engaged, he met a person, whom of all others in the&#xD;
creation he least wished to encounter. This was an&#xD;
elderly female whose professional pursuits were of&#xD;
that nature which rendered her the dreads well as&#xD;
the admiration of the surrounding peasantry; for when&#xD;
any thing was lost, she was consulted with a fee'&#xD;
when a young couple wished to know their destiny,&#xD;
she was consulted with a fee' when reputed ghosts&#xD;
made their nightly appearances, she was referred to:&#xD;
in short, she was th~ fortune-telling pythoness of&#xD;
the country, and from far and near was she consult-&#xD;
ed. Jemmy Jenkins knew her w&amp;amp;ll, and as if each&#xD;
was jealous of the other' (for. she was an old maid,&#xD;
and he an old bachelor) they had a secret spleen and&#xD;
ill-will toward the other. He denied her power,&#xD;
and called her an imposter, and she was jealous of&#xD;
him as most of the country people called him a super-&#xD;
natural being, who dealt in the black art; 'nobody&#xD;
knew on what or how he lived. Two such charac-&#xD;
ters to meet in such a place, and at sttch an hour of&#xD;
the night, was rather ominous.&#xD;
Mother Folliott, for so the oi~1 witch was called,&#xD;
in a hoarse croaking voice4 accosted him tiest with a&#xD;

Jenkins who was well aware that she possessed more&#xD;
penetration than the multitude around them, alway~&#xD;
avoided her scrutinizing eye, particularly since some&#xD;
years back; the mania so peculiar to the ~'emaie sex,&#xD;
took possession of the dame, (1 mean euriosih,~) and&#xD;
she obtruded herself to the door of old .Jenkins' hut.&#xD;
But he like a watchful Cerberus rn~t the enemy in&#xD;
front, arid opposed her entrance; a battle royal e-nsu-&#xD;
ed of scurrilous language, which coukl not prove&#xD;
very edifying to our reader~; he cursed her for an&#xD;
old impostor, and said it Would be greater charity to&#xD;
have her burned now, than any ~vitch that had been&#xD;
in the r~.ign of James the 14 of Scotland. She in&#xD;
reply, said, it was reported, and well known through&#xD;
all the country, that he had sold himself to old Nick,&#xD;
and sealed it with his blood: rise why would he&#xD;
choose to live so near the bottomss pit. And aNo,&#xD;
that he must have been a murderer. and had con-&#xD;
cealed the murdered man's property in that hellish&#xD;
den of his. This roused Jenkins' irritable feelings.&#xD;
and from words he proceeded to blow~: and wh~-&#xD;
ther Dame Folliott mounted a broom-4ick or&#xD;
crutch, we know not; but ~he maiP her retreat oirt&#xD;
of the sand-pit with as much velocity, and in neari'~&#xD;

she rubbed her shoulders. for he had inflicted some&#xD;
blows4 and in revenge, she hurled down (when out&#xD;

have annihilated our hero, had he not retired to his&#xD;

out of it' and been lost." This the dame learned, as&#xD;
she had been some time overlooking him from be.&#xD;
hind a wall, and he kept constantly muttering to&#xD;
himself his ill fate in doing so. But both keeping in&#xD;
mind the old encounter, each passed on their own&#xD;
way like two snarling dogs, cursing each other; she&#xD;
to the village, and he to his sand pit, where what the&#xD;
witch had told him in the ruin, respecting the loss&#xD;
of his penny, made him very uneasy; for said heto&#xD;
himself may she not as well know how much money&#xD;
I have, and where all my bags of it, are concealed,&#xD;
and send somebody to murder m~, and get it all?&#xD;
The thoughts of this banished sleep from his eyes,&#xD;
and as he lay awake, he was planning~ where he&#xD;
should remove it to a place of more security. He arose&#xD;
some hours before day, and taking his bags to differ~&#xD;
ent holes he had dug in remote corners of his den,&#xD;
and carefully placed the earth over them, so that if&#xD;
his hovel was entered by any one in his absence,&#xD;
they could find nothing worth carrying away.&#xD;
Old Jenkins accordingly issued forth early on the&#xD;
ensuing morning, just at the time when he thought&#xD;
there was light enough to make a ghost invisible, and&#xD;
darknesss enough to make himself so too, it was cold,&#xD;
raw, and foggy; and as his mind was not accustomed&#xD;
to consult his body, his resolution was not influenced&#xD;
by that circumstance. Just at dawn of day, he ar-&#xD;
rived at the ruin, lest Mother Folliott, or any other&#xD;
person should get there before him, with eagle eye,&#xD;
and anxious mind he sought out the spot of his so&#xD;
seeming great mishap, the preceding evening, and&#xD;
which he soon recognized; He immediately got on&#xD;
all fours, notwithstanding the wetness of the grass,&#xD;
nettles, and hemlock, he thrust himself among them;&#xD;
he persevered with determined resolution to fast till&#xD;
he had found his coin, he parted each fibre, each&#xD;
weed and Particle of grass, with scrupulous exact&#xD;

He at length came to that fatal heap of rubbish&#xD;
where his font turned under him, and gave him so&#xD;
much heart felt uneasiness; he here began to remove&#xD;
it piece by piece, thinking his truant penny must be&#xD;
concealed among sortie of its crevices. It is a pity&#xD;
we cannot here call to our aid in illustration of o~r&#xD;
story, some personof greater note for patience and ab-~&#xD;

ing all he suffered from hunger and the warring of hi~&#xD;
intestines, loosened each fragment which appeared to&#xD;
have been for centuries cemented, shaking and exam-&#xD;
ining them as he threw them asideeven beyond where&#xD;
he could conceive his coin could possibly have rolled&#xD;
to; how long he continued in this employment, none&#xD;
but himself could tell; but he remained, as he related&#xD;
himself, till the sun had reached its meridian, during&#xD;
which time he had cleared a considerable area, and&#xD;
was working out by degrees a large lump of brick or&#xD;
cement, when all on a sudden Jemmy .Jenkins, was&#xD;
no more visible on the surface of this habitable globe!&#xD;
He was precipitated into a gulph or cavern under~&#xD;
neath; how long he lay there he could not tell; but&#xD;
with the fall he for a time lost his senses, he believes&#xD;
more from fright than hurt, for when he began to&#xD;
revive, and open his eyes, the first thing that attract-&#xD;
ed his notice was a clear sky, appearing through a&#xD;
hole in an arched roof, about fifteen feet above him;&#xD;
his next care was to feel if his bones were all whole,&#xD;
which to his no small satisfaction, as well as asto-&#xD;
nishment he found so; he then tho~ht of moving out&#xD;
of a curious position in which he was placed; on get-&#xD;
ting upon his elbow, he perceived a human skeleton,&#xD;
whether bf a man or woman he could not tell, just at&#xD;
his head; I cautiously drew away from it, and as&#xD;
he got up, ~t gave a bounce which nearly pci rifled.&#xD;
him: in short he had been picking g the crown of an,&#xD;
old arch vault, or cemetery, which had in eavlier 'lays&#xD;

And long did he seek and grope, yet sought in vain,&#xD;
Riven by the wind and battered by the rain.&#xD;

ing; part of it gave way, he tumbled with it, and&#xD;
came down on one of the coffins which rested head&#xD;
and foot on two brick benches; the force of his fall&#xD;
with the rubbish, smashed the coffin, and threw up&#xD;
the skeleton in an erect position as described; a per-&#xD;
spiration. which he was but seldom accustomed to,&#xD;
oozed through every pore: from his long fasting, his&#xD;
body became weak, and at the moment, he would&#xD;
have given hal~C his wealth for even a drink of cold&#xD;
water: to get out of this horrible place was his next&#xD;
anxious thought, he had now leisure to curse his ex-&#xD;
traordinary l)arsimoily, and began to consider, per-&#xD;
naps ~4 hours more, might make his old bones com~&#xD;
panions to those around him.&#xD;
His wits were at all times acute, but more particu-&#xD;
larly in time of need. "What said he to himself&#xD;
can these bones do to me, as he examined from coffin&#xD;
to coffin; the vault seemed to be of considerable&#xD;
length, the top of it was far above his reach and how&#xD;
to get extricated he knew not: he groped along the&#xD;
damp walls, nor could he find the smallest opening&#xD;
any where; the darkness was impenetrable, a short&#xD;
distance from where he intruded himself; to stay&#xD;
there much longer was certain death: the night was&#xD;
also approaching. He began to rear some of the&#xD;
old coffins, rubbish, and bricks, from the benches, to&#xD;
make a mound by which he might reach the top of&#xD;
the arch,-" Ha!" said he to himself, "I must now&#xD;
try to' make the dead raise the living, rather than&#xD;
the living raise the dead. In moving the broken&#xD;
p arts of the coffin on which he had fallen, he thought&#xD;
hep perceived something shining, of a bright lustre,&#xD;
and more particularly as he stood between ~t and the&#xD;
light; it startled him a little, but moving again&#xD;
nearer, he more distinctly perceived it was some kind&#xD;
of metal; he put over his hand and to his no small&#xD;
astonishment found it to be a golden cross set with&#xD;
diamonds which had been suspended round the neck&#xD;
of the skeleton by a golden chain previous to intera&#xD;

ment; he eagerly pulled it toward him, and with it&#xD;
came the skull of its once owner, which fell at his&#xD;
feet, he gazed upon it with avidity peculiar to him-&#xD;
self, he forgot all he sufh~red, even the chance he had&#xD;
yet of extricating himself from his present situation;&#xD;
he had even thoughts of searching further for more&#xD;
spoils; but the calls of nature demanded his every&#xD;
exertion to supply it: he deposited the cross and&#xD;
chain carefully in the many-fold of his many-pieced&#xD;
garment, and proceeded with alacrity to raise his&#xD;
heap higher, till at last, by patience and persever-&#xD;
ance, he once more protruded his cadaverous coun-&#xD;
tenance into the open air; eager once more to get&#xD;
above h~s mother earth, he made a spring, but un-&#xD;
fortunately either a piece of the arch gave way with&#xD;
his weigt~t, or his fragile footing underneath, or per-&#xD;
haps both, but our hero was once more hurled in a&#xD;
rolling position to the lowest depth of the charnel-&#xD;
house, accompanied with bricks, mortar, old coffin:&#xD;
dry bones, &amp;amp;c. Fortunately for him his good genius&#xD;
again befriended him; he was not seriously hurt:&#xD;
(save a few bruises, and a cut in the face from which&#xD;
he bled copiously:) he got up, shook himself, and&#xD;
set about again preparing a more permanent way,&#xD;
by which he at length set his foot on terra firma.&#xD;

the precaution of putting another penny in his pock-&#xD;
et, lest he should not find that which he had lost;&#xD;
elated with his new prize, although he was two days&#xD;
without food, he nearly forgot his internal wants&#xD;
however he set off to the village, made his purchase,&#xD;
and as he jogged homeward again through his fa-&#xD;
vorite spot, (the abbey,) he administered some con-&#xD;
solation to his craving appetite. Our hero gave a&#xD;
peep into t'he vault 'as he passed, but all was dark&#xD;
and dismal; he began te perceive some, qualms of&#xD;
conscience' the words of old mother Foliiott rever-&#xD;

who made him the instrument of redeeming the tr ea-&#xD;
sure, already too long concealed from the useful pur&#xD;
poses of man.&#xD;
When he got to his den, he carefully closed the&#xD;
dPor, struck a light, examined his prize minulely:&#xD;
and to his no small gratification found the diamonds&#xD;
to be real, and of great value,-.-the metal they&#xD;
were set in, and chain, to be of massive pure gold~&#xD;
He of course hid it carefully, and happy would it&#xD;
have been for 'him if he had gone to sic ep without&#xD;
thinking further of the transactions of the day; but&#xD;
his evil gen~ns suggested to him, that surely if the&#xD;
first coffin he had by chance broken open possessed&#xD;
~o much treasure, what must the rest contain? this&#xD;
haunted his mind in such a manner that sleep be-.&#xD;
caine a stranger to him.&#xD;
He got up the next morning unrefreshed and un-&#xD;
well, he had residedin this hole for a number of years,&#xD;
without once experiencing pain or ache; but the&#xD;
~inusual perturbation of his mind for the last two days,&#xD;
with the frights, fatigues, and long fa~tin~ evidently&#xD;
1)reyed upon him: soon as day light appeared, he&#xD;
straggled out for a pitcher of spring-water, but was&#xD;
scarce able to return with it; he barricaded his door,&#xD;
and was obliged to lie dowp, and take to his bed; he&#xD;
would have given the world for any kind of person&#xD;
o attend him; but alas! no human person was near.&#xD;
It was evident he had caught a fever, and much like&#xD;
Robinson Crusoe, in his uninhabited island, our hero&#xD;
fared, arid for an entire week he lived on spring-&#xD;
water; by keeping himself so very low, he may be&#xD;
literally said to have starved out the complaint, 50&#xD;
that at the end of the week, he was able to crawl out&#xD;
r~f bed to unbolthis door; for some charitable people&#xD;
in the neighbourhood not perceiving hun abroad as&#xD;

rharty, which he accepted of, and was soon able to&#xD;
resume his former walks. We may naturally suppose~&#xD;
the vault was his first care, for the longer he staid&#xD;
from it, the more he felt convinced in his own mind,&#xD;

at this time a dark night, for Jenkins thought it more&#xD;
udent to resume his search during that period, as&#xD;
~in~&#xD;
b least liable to be disturbed by any hAng crea-&#xD;

candles, tinder-box, a rope to let himself down by,&#xD;
which he made fast to a neighboring tree: ~oon as&#xD;
he reached the bottom, he struck a light which he&#xD;
cautiously removed to atlistance tlom the aperture,&#xD;
and was about commencing his depredations on one&#xD;
of the leaden coffins, when he perceived some rub-&#xD;

tance down the vatilt, and softly returned to recon-&#xD;
noitre: but as he confessed himself not without some&#xD;
apprehensions for his safety. He perceived a per-&#xD;
son looking into the hole, and heard a voice which&#xD;
he soon recognized to be Mother Folliott's, crying,&#xD;
"Vou old thief, come forth from robbing' the dead."&#xD;
Jenkins, who in his heart cursed her for this inter-&#xD;
ruption, and fearing she might apprise the people&#xD;
of the neighbourhood before he would be able to&#xD;
complete his purpose; having a long staff in his hand&#xD;
which he usually walked with, and finding the skull&#xD;
which a few days before he had dragged off the skele-&#xD;
ton, he ingeniously fixed it on the head of the staff,&#xD;
pretty firms he softly stole tinder where thedame&#xD;
hadp rejected her head, and as she was about to re-&#xD;
peat the words again, he gave her a severe puck of&#xD;
the bare skull in the face, which made her draw&#xD;
back and roar out lustily. He immediately bethought&#xD;
himself of a method to get rid of her effectually, with-&#xD;
out exposing himself; knowing the skull to be hol-&#xD;
low, he immediately proceeded to the candle, off&#xD;
which with his knife, he cut a short bit, and placed&#xD;
it on the head of his stick within the skull, so that it&#xD;
had almost frightful appearance, the light showing&#xD;
in strong rays through the eyes, nose, &amp;amp;c. and be-&#xD;
fore the old witch could remove many paces, he&#xD;
slowly raised the scull some feet above the mouth of&#xD;
the hole, and turned it round and round, so that she&#xD;
could not possibly fail to see it in all its shapes~ An&#xD;
hysterical scream, from the old witch, was the result&#xD;
of this stratagem; for perceiving no body, and the&#xD;
skull only ascending from such a place, her strides&#xD;
from the spot were rapid and quick-nor did she&#xD;
any more trouble old Jenkins, not even in day light&#xD;
could any one persuade her to go near the old ruin&#xD;
afterward.&#xD;
Jenkins perceiving the effect his stratagem had&#xD;
upon her, Mt a secret pleasure, insomuch that the&#xD;
muscles of his rugged countenance, which for yeai~s&#xD;
before had not exhibited even a symptom of joy, bed&#xD;

&#xD;
came risible in horrid deformity. When all was qui.&#xD;
et he resumed his search, and from many of the cof.&#xD;
fins he obtained some valuable prizes of the sacred&#xD;
relies of the superstition of early days; it was evi-&#xD;
dent this had been the burial place of the nuns of&#xD;
the adjoining convent, as it was the custom in those&#xD;
times to bury them with their sacred ornaments on.&#xD;
He continued his search until it was near morning,&#xD;
when he thought it would be no longer prudent to&#xD;
stay: he had got valuable booty, and not without anx-&#xD;
iety he ascended the open, which he easily regained&#xD;
by assistance of the rope, and arrived at his hut~ in&#xD;
safety.&#xD;
After taking some rest he employed\tbe greater&#xD;
part of the following day in examining and cleaning&#xD;
off the rust which had accumulated on the articles&#xD;
in the coffins. Having gone for several nights suc-&#xD;
cessively, rummaged and turned out every bone one&#xD;
by one, that time had not done so to before; he dis-&#xD;
covered an iron door at the lower end of the vault,&#xD;
which after extraordinary exertion he forced open;&#xD;
he described a narrow flight of winding spiral stairs&#xD;
by which he cautiously descended to a long narrow&#xD;
passage: his light became very faint as he proceed-&#xD;
ed, he found a difficulty of breathing; a dizziness&#xD;
seized him, so that he was obliged to grasp at the&#xD;
wall to prevent his falling down; it provider~tially&#xD;
occurred to him to return quickly back; he grad-&#xD;
ually recovered as he got near the iron door, but his&#xD;
candle had gone out and left him in impenetrable&#xD;
darkness; he had brought a small bag which contain-&#xD;
ed a few tools, a tinder-box, and some other necessa-&#xD;
ries; he had left these down in the upper vault, and&#xD;
with great difficulty he groped his way u~p the steps,&#xD;
which projected over a round tower or well of con-&#xD;
siderThle depth underneath, but at that time he was&#xD;
not aware that if he should make the smallest slip,&#xD;
his bones should lie there to accowpanv those arou d.&#xD;
He regained the iron door in safety, sought and found&#xD;

his bag, re-lit his candle and gave up further research&#xD;
for that night.&#xD;
A few evenings afterwards, going to the village as&#xD;
usual to purchase his necessaries, as he sat resting&#xD;
himself in the chandler's shop, two neighbours hap-&#xD;
pened to be chatting on news of the (lay; one sud-&#xD;
denly turned and asked the other, "Had he heard&#xD;
any particulars respecting Mother Folliolt's death,"&#xD;
the other replied "he had not,- save some strange&#xD;
stories which he did not believe;" the other said&#xD;
"she died out of her wits, that she had declared seve&#xD;
ral times before it, that she had seen the devil in a&#xD;
vault in the old abbey, and it had such an effect on&#xD;
her, that she died in seven days after." Old Jenk-&#xD;
ins listened with great attention, and notwithstand-&#xD;
ihg that he felt secretly glad that he had such an in-&#xD;
veterate enemy out of his way: yet he felt consider-&#xD;
able qualms of conscience at being the cause--which&#xD;
now he had no doubt but he was. From that day&#xD;
forward he visibly declined in his health, as it was&#xD;
thought the recollection of it preyed on his mind,&#xD;
yet notwithstanding he was immensely rich, and&#xD;
without knowing one individual relation, or friend,&#xD;
that he cared about, he would not allow himself to&#xD;
drink any thing but Water, and eat things of the&#xD;
coarsest kind.&#xD;
He formed the resolution of visiting the vault as&#xD;
he was not by any means satisfied with the discovery&#xD;
he had already made; he would descend into it once&#xD;
more. A few days after, he went with his bag, tools&#xD;
and apparatus; after having descended the frightful&#xD;
spiral stairs beneath the iron door,,, he proceeded&#xD;
along the Vaulte(l passage, his candle burned bright-&#xD;
er than before: for he having left the door open, the&#xD;
foul air had evaporated; and as he proceeded to the&#xD;
end, his progress was stopped by a massive iron grate,&#xD;
which was bolted on the side next to him, and bad&#xD;
the appearance of not being opened for centuries;&#xD;
Jenkins applied his tools to the door, which from&#xD;
being nearly reduced to rust from perpetual damp&#xD;
206&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
soon yielded to his persevering hand; and within&#xD;
nearly opposite, in a stone nitch cut in the wall, ap&#xD;
peered the bones of a huge human skeleton fallen t~&#xD;
pieces; round each anele-bone was a large iCOfl ring&#xD;
rivited, an(l iron rings bad heenround the arms also;&#xD;
a strong iron chain lay on the ground, which appear-&#xD;
ed to have been made fast to a staple in the wall ad-&#xD;
joining, and another large one in the flagged floor&#xD;
of the dungeon, for such it appeared to be, for it ad-&#xD;
inited no light in any place;- this dungeon termi-&#xD;
nale(l the passage. Round the nitch where the skele-&#xD;
ton lay, appeared to be carved, by some rude piece&#xD;
of metal, some characters in Saxon or Old English,'&#xD;
which after closely and minutely observing, he could&#xD;
trace or nearly guess it to be " £ramine the 2'ower;"&#xD;
he took the hint, and proceed~ to do so, an4 on strik-&#xD;
ing all round, he thought he perceived it appear hol-&#xD;
low--and on closer application of his tool he rooted&#xD;
out an oaken wainscot, which was artfully placed in&#xD;
the wall, and which mouldered nearly at his touch.&#xD;
"What was the astonishment of the Miser when he&#xD;
beheld concealed in this large cavity or press, all the&#xD;
massive gold and silver services of tl~ churches he&#xD;
longing to this once vast establishment. At length,&#xD;
said he, "Are all my risks, my toils, and dangers re~&#xD;
warded. Oh! thou good, thou generous skeleton.,&#xD;
thy bones shall here have quiet burial; no more, shall&#xD;
cruel man insult thy remains; thori hast been gene~&#xD;
rous even in thy death. '-&#xD;
Jenkins took his bones and du~ a hole without&#xD;
the tower in the passage, and laid them at full length,&#xD;
which appeared full eight feet. But whom or what&#xD;
he was, he could not ascertain: soon as he had corn-&#xD;
pleted this, he took from the press the ponderous gold&#xD;
and silver vessels, and laid thenion the floor around&#xD;
him, until he was tuore than knee deep :n the nrc-&#xD;
cious uu'tak: he proceeded to remove them to the&#xD;

easy at remaining long at any time sepultured-he&#xD;
had resolved on removing his prey by night to his&#xD;
den, to avoid suspicion; he carried about one half of&#xD;
it to the outer vault, and had removed it by many a&#xD;
weary journey to his hut at night; but whether from&#xD;
his late illness, and not taking proper care of, or ab&#xD;
lowing himself proper nourishment after, or perhaps&#xD;
he got cold from remaining too long in the vault, or&#xD;
used greater exertion than he was able to bear, he&#xD;
took violently ill, after returning hoiAe, and had&#xD;
some presentiment of his death.-Standing at his&#xD;
door, one morning, a little after sunrise, he hailed&#xD;
a labouring man belonging to a farmer, who had&#xD;
often been kind to and had protected him from the&#xD;
insult of Wicked boys. On this worthy yeoman's&#xD;
ground he had so long resided, and under his protec-&#xD;
tion he had so long remained quiet and unmolested;&#xD;
he believing him to be wretchedly poor, and was one&#xD;
of those who called to see him after he had been sick,&#xD;
and. sent him nourishment; and who had not the&#xD;
slightest hope of reward. He desired the man to&#xD;
send his master to him immediately. The man went&#xD;
for him, and he came soon after; Jenkins waited for&#xD;
him with considerable impatience; he was sitting a&#xD;
little within his door on a stone bench scarcely able&#xD;
to support~ himself upright: Jenkins made a sign to&#xD;
the farmer to support him to his bed: the farmer&#xD;
complied, after laying him down in an easy posture,&#xD;
he beckoned him to sit down beside him, that he had&#xD;
something of importance to communicate to him,&#xD;
and began nearly as follows:-&#xD;
"My old friend, I perceive my end approaching&#xD;
fast, I now find I have all along lived a miserably bad&#xD;
life-at war with myself and all the world. The only&#xD;
consolation I have left, is, that I am about to leave&#xD;
those riches that have been such a curse to me, rather&#xD;
than a blessing, to the only man who has shown&#xD;
me any kindness; I know I should have received&#xD;
kindness from others, had I merited it myself: but&#xD;
for my temper and disposition, which my destiny&#xD;
205&#xD;
&#xD;
would not permit me to control: Your kind inter.&#xD;
ference often in my behalf, must have sprung from&#xD;
a disinterested motive, which shall now be reward~&#xD;
ed beyond your most sanguine expectations. To&#xD;
give you a sketch of my life, would, perhaps, to you&#xD;
be uninteresting, nor am I able (said he with a deep&#xD;
sigh) now to accomplish it: it must suffice at present&#xD;
to state, I early in life~ was active, vigilant and&#xD;
careful; by various pursuits, as an itinerant mer~&#xD;
chant, I amassed a considerable sum of money, and&#xD;
by a(lvantageously placing it at interest, and my own&#xD;
~rery moderate mode of living, in a long series of&#xD;
years (for I am now eighty-seven) has accumulated&#xD;
many thousand pounds. Alas! my whole conso~&#xD;
nation and delight, for years has been often to reckon,&#xD;
tie up in bags, and toconceal it, in this miserable&#xD;
hovel; this very wealth has been the cause of all my&#xD;
miseries in life, being always afraid to remove it&#xD;
with me. This hut I have kept l~" and miserable,&#xD;
and my person in like manner, that the profligate&#xD;
should not think it worth their notice to commit de-&#xD;
predations on either; but I find my strength grow-&#xD;
ing weaker, with what I have already said; I am&#xD;
nearly exhausted; and he sunk back on his misera-&#xD;
ble trickle bed."&#xD;
The astonished farmer, whose name was Thomas&#xD;
Johnson, could scarce believe what he had heard; he&#xD;
got his arm under his head, a death-like paleness&#xD;
overshadowed his countenance, and he seemed as if&#xD;
he had departed this life. Mr. Johnson ran out, he&#xD;
had to go a short distance, he called his wife, and&#xD;
meeting the servant man who had first called him&#xD;
to Jenkins, he desired them to accompany him to&#xD;
the hut; that he believed the old man was dying.&#xD;
They immediately followed-on entering the hut,&#xD;
they found 01(1 Jenkins had a little revived, that his&#xD;
eyes were half open, but in so weak a state, as not&#xD;
to be able to utter or s1)eak to be understood; he&#xD;
moved his lips, Mrs. Johnson approached the bed,&#xD;
she gave him a little drink which revived him; he&#xD;

motioned for pen and ink, and pointed out to where&#xD;
it could be got, with a supply of paper. Mr. John~&#xD;

side, the paper was placed conveniently to him, and&#xD;

He then motioned to be laid down gently, and&#xD;
seemed to drop asleep; Mrs. Johnson stepped home,&#xD;
gdt some nourishment suited for such a patient, and&#xD;
brought some reviving cordials with her. Mr John-&#xD;
son and the man remained to watch him; in about&#xD;
two hours he awoke; Mrs. Johnson was in the room,&#xD;
she had made some teal of which he took a little; he&#xD;
beckoned to call Mr. Johnson, and in presence of his&#xD;
wife, pointed to a corner of the hut, (the man had left&#xD;
it) and on taking off an old piece of coarse cloth,&#xD;
they were astonished at beholding the massive church&#xD;
plate, part of which Jenkins had just removed home&#xD;
as before related; Johnson started, looked at Jenkins,&#xD;
as much as to say, God forgive you old man, for I&#xD;
fear you have been guilty of many robberies of the&#xD;
worst kind. Jenkins perceived him, and guessed at&#xD;
his thoughts, he motioned with his head to come&#xD;
~lose to him, when he said in a low tone of voice,&#xD;
"My friend, I perceive your meaning, these \hings&#xD;

ed there by some of those who had the care of them,&#xD;
in times of anarchy and confusion, and the secret of&#xD;
their concealment (lied with those who had put them&#xD;
there." lie then gave an account how he would be&#xD;
able to obtain the remainder; he then pointed out&#xD;
where he ha(l concealed the differentt bags of gold,&#xD;
and the distances he had buried them in the earth.&#xD;
" I find I am unable to say more." He sunk into a&#xD;
hind of lethargy, his extremities got cold, and before&#xD;
evening, be departed without a struggle.&#xD;
Johnson and his wife could scarcely believe all&#xD;
this real, and began to fancy it was a fairy dream;&#xD;
hut ~vhcn ea9h convinced the other that both were&#xD;
in their sober senses by feeling and examining their&#xD;
now vast property, real and personal, they both fell&#xD;
on their knees, as if by instinct, anti returned thanks&#xD;
to the Great Donor, of all good, who had made the&#xD;
wretched man so lately departed, as the instrument&#xD;
of their great uprise in the world, and so unsought&#xD;
for. Their next care was to secure their treasure in&#xD;
a place of safety, and to get the old man decently&#xD;
interred, all which was soon accomplished. Johnson&#xD;
had removed from the dungeon the remainder of the&#xD;
plate, had the whole conveyed to London and con-&#xD;
verted into cash, which, together with the vast sum&#xD;
of ready money which he care fully dug out of differ&#xD;
ent parts, in and near the miser's cave, he purchased&#xD;
a handsome estate, where he now resides, doing&#xD;
with it much good, and is an ornament in society.&#xD;

SAINT PETER AND THE BLACKSMITH.&#xD;
&#xD;
IN Roman Catholic countries it was a very ancient&#xD;
custom for the preacher to divert his congregation&#xD;
in due season with what is termed an Eastern tale,&#xD;
which was received by the auditors with peals of&#xD;
Eastern laughter. During Lent the good people&#xD;
had mortified themselves and prayed so much, that&#xD;
they began to be discontented and ill tempered; so&#xD;
that the clergy deemed it necessary to make a little&#xD;
fun from the pulpit for them, and thus gave as it were&#xD;
the first impulse towards the revival of mirth and&#xD;
cheerfulness. This practice lasted till the seven..&#xD;
teeth century. The following isby the Rev. Father&#xD;
Attansy.&#xD;
Our Lord was journeying with St., Peter and had&#xD;
passed through many countries. One day he came&#xD;
to a place where there was no inn, and entered the&#xD;
house of a blacksmith. This man had a wife who&#xD;
paid the utmost respect to the strangers, and treated&#xD;
them with the best that her house could afford.&#xD;
When they were about to depart, our Lord and St.&#xD;
Peter wished her all that was good, and heaven be-&#xD;
side. Said the woman: "Ah! if [ do but go to&#xD;
heaven,'I care for nothing else." "Doubt not," said&#xD;
St. Peter, "for it would be contrary to scripture if&#xD;
thou shouldst not go. Open thy mouth. Did I not&#xD;
say so? Why, thou canst not be sent to hell, where&#xD;
there is wailing and gnashing of teeth-for thou hast&#xD;
not a tooth left in thy head. Thou art safe enough;&#xD;
be of good cheer." Who was so everjoyed as the&#xD;
good woman? Without doubt she took another cup&#xD;
on the strength of this assurance.&#xD;
But our Lord was desirous to testify his thanks to&#xD;
the man also, and promised to grant him four wishes.&#xD;
"Well," said the smith, "I am heartily obliged to&#xD;
you, and wish, that if any one climbs up the pear&#xD;
tree behind my house, he may not ~e able to get&#xD;
21~2&#xD;
&#xD;
down again without my leave." This grieved St&#xD;
Peter not a little, for he thought that the smith ought&#xD;
rather to have wished for the kingdom of heaven.&#xD;
B~~t oui~ Lord, with his wanted kindness, granted his&#xD;
petition. The smith's next wish was that if any one&#xD;
sat down upon his anvil, he might not be able to rise&#xD;
withoutt his permission: and the third, that if any.&#xD;
one crept into his old flue, he might not get oat with..&#xD;
out his consent.&#xD;
St. Peter said, "Friend smith, beware what thou&#xD;
dost. These are all wishes that can bring thee no&#xD;
advantage. Be wise, and let the remaining one be&#xD;
for everlasting life with the blest in heaven." The&#xD;
smith was not to be put out of his way, and thus pro-&#xD;
ceeded; "My fourth wish is, that my green cap may&#xD;
belong to me for ever; and that whenever I sit down&#xD;
upon it no power or force may be able to drive me&#xD;
away."&#xD;
Thereupon our Lord went his way with St. Peter,&#xD;
and the smith lived some years longer with his old&#xD;
woman. At the end of this time, grim death ap-&#xD;
peared, and summoned him to the other world.&#xD;
Stop a moment," said the smith; "let me just put&#xD;
on a clean shirt, meanwhile you may pick some of&#xD;
the pears on yonder tree." Death climbed up the&#xD;
tree, but he could not gct down again; he was forc-&#xD;
ed to submit to the smith's terms, a respite for twen-&#xD;
ty years, before he returned.&#xD;
When the, twenty years were expired, he again&#xD;
appeared, and commanded him in the nan-le of the&#xD;
Lord and St. Peter, to go along with him. "I know&#xD;
St. Peter too," said the smith; "sit down a little on&#xD;
my. anvil, for thou must be tired; I will just drink a&#xD;
cu~ to cheer me, and take leave of my old woman,&#xD;
and be with thee presently." But death could not&#xD;
rise again from his seat, and was obliged to promise&#xD;
the smith another de1a~ of twenty years.&#xD;
When these had elapsed, old Satan came, and&#xD;
would fain have dragged the smith away by force.&#xD;
~' Halloo, fellow !" said the tatter, "that won't do.&#xD;

I have other letters, and wvhiter than thou with thy&#xD;
black carla bianca. But if thou art such a conjurer&#xD;
as-to imagine that thou hast any power over me, let&#xD;
me see if thou canst get into this old rusty flue." No&#xD;
sooner said, than the old one slipped into the old flue.&#xD;
The smith and his men put the flue into the fire, then&#xD;
carried it to the anvil, and hammered away at the&#xD;
old one most unmercifully. He howled, and beg.-.&#xD;
ged, and prayed; and at last promised that he would&#xD;
have nothing to do with the smith if he would but&#xD;
let him depart.&#xD;
At length the smith's guardian-angel made his ap-&#xD;
pearance. The business was now serious. He was&#xD;
obliged to go. The angel conducted him to torment.&#xD;
Satan, whom he had so terribly belaboured, was just&#xD;
then attending the gate; he looked out at the little&#xD;
window, but quickly shut it again, and would have&#xD;
nothing to do with the smith. The angel then con-&#xD;
ducted him to the gate of heaven. St. Peter refus-&#xD;
ed to admit him. " Let me just peep in," said the&#xD;
smith, "that I may see how it looks there." No&#xD;
sooner was the wicket opened than the smith threw&#xD;
in his cap and said: " Thou knowest it is my pro..&#xD;
perty, I must go and fetch it."-Then slipping past,&#xD;
he clapped himself down upon it and said: " Now I&#xD;
am sitting on my own property; I should like to see&#xD;
who dares drive me away from it." Thus the smith&#xD;
got into heaven at last.&#xD;
INTERESTING ACCOUNT OF THE CAMELEON.&#xD;
~WHENEVER I kept my cameleons confined i~ a&#xD;
cage, and there plagued and tormented them, I al-,&#xD;
ways easily; succeeded in exciting a degree of irrita-&#xD;
tion and anger, which they manifested by respiring the&#xD;
air so strong, as to be heard: they likewise became&#xD;
thin, and their colour gradually became dull. If I&#xD;

to a yellow, tinge; then to yellow, spotted with reu;&#xD;
next a yellow-brown, spotted with-red-brown; then&#xD;

and more and more thin. .These are the only colours&#xD;
in which I could succeed in making them assume.&#xD;
After having thus tormented and kept them prison-&#xD;
ers during a number of days, I set them free. I&#xD;
carried them to a tree, or into the grass; and how-&#xD;
ever black, and, meagre they were, they quickly as-&#xD;
sumed their green colour, and their usual state of&#xD;
solidity.&#xD;
Reiterated experiments have therefore convinced&#xD;
me, that the cameleon, in a state of perfect liberty,&#xD;
is always fat, and of a green hue; and that in a state&#xD;
of captivity not only its colour becomes changed, but&#xD;
its health also experiences an alteration.&#xD;
I have often wrapped mny cameleons up in white,&#xD;
red, blue, violet, green, and yellow stuffs, and lef..&#xD;
them thus for whole days together;. at the end of&#xD;
.which, when I visited my poor captives, I found them&#xD;
neither white, red, blue, violet, yellow, nor a fine&#xD;
green; but, on the contrary, always of that yellow-.&#xD;
green, that tarnished yellow, or that grey-black,&#xD;
.which they for ever assume, when in distress and&#xD;
suffering.&#xD;

THE&#xD;
&#xD;
TEACHER TAUGHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
The woman is commanded to obey the man, and&#xD;
the man ought to obey the woman.&#xD;
The man is superior to the woman, and the wo-&#xD;
man is inferior to the man; yet both are equal, and&#xD;
he woman shall govern the man.&#xD;
Yet there are not iwo obedient, but one obedient.&#xD;
For there is one dominion nominal of the husband,&#xD;
and another dominion real of the wife; and vet therc&#xD;
are not two dominions, but one dominion.&#xD;
For like as we are compelled by the Christian&#xD;
verity to acknowledge, that wives must submit them-&#xD;
selves to their husbands, and be subject to them in&#xD;
all things,&#xD;
So are we fQrbidden, by the conjugal faith, that&#xD;
they should he at all influenced by their wills, or pay&#xD;
any regard to their commands.&#xD;
The man was not created for the woman, but the&#xD;
woman for the man.&#xD;
let the man shall be the slave of the woman, and&#xD;
the woman the tyrant of the man.&#xD;
So that in all things, as is aforesaid, the subjection&#xD;
of' the sup Ck'ZOP to the jiferior is to be believed.&#xD;
He, therefore, that will be married, must thus&#xD;
think of the woman and the man.&#xD;
Furthermore, it is necessary to submissive matri-&#xD;
mony that lie also believe rightly the infallibility of&#xD;
the wife:&#xD;
For the right faith is, that we believe and confess&#xD;
that the wife is fallible and infallible:&#xD;
Perfectly fallihie, and j)erfectly infallible' of one&#xD;
('rrkrig soul anti unerring, mind, subsisting; fallible as&#xD;
touching hei' human r~ature, and infallible as touch-&#xD;
j~pr her female sex.&#xD;
Who., although she be fallible and infallible, yet&#xD;
she is .not two mit one woman, who submitted to&#xD;
lawful marriage to acquire unlawful dominionn, and&#xD;
1~oinised religiously to obey, that she might rule in&#xD;
folly and injustice.&#xD;
This is the conjugal faith, which, except a man&#xD;
believe &amp;amp;aithfuUy, he ought ne~'er to be married.&#xD;

THERE dwelt in Rome, two very intimate friends,&#xD;
and relations of the family of Savelli, the one named&#xD;
Bacciuolo, and the other Pietro Paolo, both nobly&#xD;
born, and possessed of sufficient wealth. These&#xD;
young men determined to go and complete their&#xD;
studies at Betogna; one wished to study the common&#xD;
law, and the other the canon law. They according-&#xD;
lv took leave of their friends, and came to Bei~;gna,&#xD;
and assiduously applied themselves to their respec-&#xD;
tive pursuits, which they continued for some time.&#xD;
Now, as you no doubt know, the former improved&#xD;
himself much sooner than Pietro Paolo; for which&#xD;
reason, being now a licentiate, he determined to re~&#xD;
turn to Rome, and said to Pietro Paolo,-" Brother,&#xD;
since I am now a licentiate, I have resolved to re-&#xD;
turn home." Pietro Paolo answered, "I prithee do&#xD;
not leave me here--oblige me by remaining the win..&#xD;
ter-.--then in the spring we will go together. Thou,&#xD;
in the mean time, mayest learn some other scienc~~,&#xD;
by which means thou wilt not waste thy time."&#xD;
Bacciuolo willingly agreed to the proposal, promis-&#xD;
ed to wait for him, and in order not to lose his time,&#xD;
ivent to the professor, and said, "Sir, having made&#xD;
up my mind to remain with my friend and relation,&#xD;
I would be glad, if it pleased you to teach me some&#xD;
noble science during my stay." The professor an&#xD;

swered, that he would most willingly (10 it. "Chuse&#xD;
which science you prefer, and I will teach it you with&#xD;
pleasure." BacciuQlo then replied, "Worthy Sii', I&#xD;
would learn how to make love, and to set about it."&#xD;
The professor, smiling, answered, "this is a good&#xD;
joke, thou couldst not have hit on a science in which I&#xD;
am a greater adept. Now then go thy ways on Sunday&#xD;
morning to the church of the minor friars-there thou&#xD;
wilt see numbers of fine women assembled, and wilt&#xD;
-, be able to pitch upon some one that may take thy fan&#xD;
cy. W'hen thou hast selected the one, follow her until&#xD;
you find out where she lives-then return to me.&#xD;
~rhis is the first part of my instructions." Baccinolo&#xD;
departed, and on the following Sunday, going to the&#xD;
church as he had been desired, and eyeing all the&#xD;
pretty women, for there were many, he saw one&#xD;
among them that pleased him much-she being very&#xD;
handsome and graceful. XVhen she left the church,&#xD;
Bacciuolo took care to follow her close, and saw and&#xD;
marked the house where she dwelt, not however,&#xD;
without the lady perceiving that the young student&#xD;
- had taken a fancy to her. Bacejuolo returned to the&#xD;
professor, and said, "I have done as you desired me,&#xD;
and I have seen one whom I like very much."&#xD;
Upon which the professor said he was highly pleas&#xD;
ed, and smiled at Bacciuolo, seeing what species of&#xD;
science he was anxious to learn, and he said to him,&#xD;
* "be sure you make a point of passing by her house,&#xD;
as it were carelessly, two or three times every day,&#xD;
and have your eyes about you, and take care that no&#xD;
one observes you looking at her, but enjoy as muen&#xD;
as thou mayest the sight of her, and let her perceive&#xD;
that thou art in love with her; then return to me&#xD;
This is the second part of my instructions." Bac&#xD;
cinolo left the professor, and cautiously began to&#xD;
walk to and fro before the lady's house; so that the&#xD;
lady perceived that he must certainly walk to and&#xD;
fro before the house, for the purpose of seeing her-&#xD;
- she, therefore, began to eye him; insomuch that Bac-&#xD;
eiuolo began to bow most respectfully to her, and&#xD;
21S&#xD;
&#xD;
she returned the salutation several times, the which&#xD;
persuaded Bacejuolo that the lady did not dislike&#xD;
bin-i. He, of course, reported the whole to the pro..&#xD;
f~ssor; who answered, "well, I am pleased with this,&#xD;
and you have ruled yourself well hitherto. Now&#xD;
you must endeavour to find one of those female ped..&#xD;
~ers, that sell trinkets, purses, and such like in the&#xD;
streets of Bologna, and set her to make the lady a'&#xD;
quainted with your passion, how much you are de-&#xD;
vote(1 to her, and that there is none you could prefer&#xD;
to her, and how happy you would be if she would lay&#xD;
upon you any commands, by which you could prove&#xD;
your (levotlon to her: thou wilt hear what she says&#xD;
to this, an(l thou wilt report it to me and I -will di...&#xD;
rect thy future conduct." Bacciuolo immediately&#xD;
went out and found a peddler perfectly well acquaint-&#xD;
ed with her trade, and addressed her thus: "I wish&#xD;
you to do me a great kindness, and I will reward you&#xD;
handsomely." The woman answered, "I will obey&#xD;
your orders, for I have nothing to look to but to get&#xD;
money." Bacciuolo gave her a crown-piece, and&#xD;
said, "I wish you to go to-day to a house in a street&#xD;
called the Maccarella; there lives a damsel, called&#xD;
the Lady Giovanna, whom I love more than any other&#xD;
living creature; and I wish you to get me into&#xD;
her good graces, and tell her I would gladly do any&#xD;
thing that might give her pleasure; and say all the&#xD;
pretty coaxing things, which I am sure you can say&#xD;
on such occasions; therefore I entreat you to exert&#xD;
your skill." The little old woman answered, "rest&#xD;
assured, kind Signior, I will do my best, and find a&#xD;
favourable opportunity for the purpose." "Go, my&#xD;
good woman," said Bacciuolo, "and I will wait for&#xD;
you here." She immediately set forth with her lit&#xD;
tle basket of trinkets, and went up to the lady, whom&#xD;
she found sitting at her door to breathe the cool air,&#xD;
Courtesying to her she said, "Lady, are there any of&#xD;
these trinkets that you would like to have? Take&#xD;
whatever you please, lady," said she, and seated&#xD;

"if I had money about me, I should willingly purchase&#xD;
that purse." The little woman cried, "La! Ma'ani,&#xD;
don't think about that, take it if it pleases you, for&#xD;
every thing in this basket is paid for." The lady&#xD;
was surprised to hear this, and said, "Good woman,&#xD;
what do you mean, what are you saying?" The&#xD;
little old woman, with tears in her eyes, said, "'Why,&#xD;
Madam, I will tell you. The truth is, a young gen-&#xD;
tleman, whose name is Bacciuolo, and who is des-&#xD;
perately in love with you, has sent me. He says,&#xD;
you are the only creature on earth he loves, and that&#xD;
he would willingly do any thing to merit your re-&#xD;
gard, and that to obey any commands of yours ~vill&#xD;
be the greatest happiness to him. Indeed, I fear he&#xD;
cannot live unless you allow him to speak to you.&#xD;
As for my part, I never saw so genteel a youth in&#xD;
my life." The lady on hearing these things blushed,&#xD;
and turning to the woman, said, "were it not for&#xD;
my honour's sake, old woman, I would expose you&#xD;
to the world, and that would make you repent. Ad&#xD;
thou not ashamed, thou good-for-nothing old hag, to&#xD;
come on such an errand to a modest woman, a plague&#xD;
upon thee !"-and so saying, the lady 5CiZe(l hold of&#xD;
a stick which lay behind the door to give her a beat-&#xD;
ing, adding, "if ever thou comes hereagain, I will&#xD;
beat thee black and blue." Upon which the old&#xD;
woman quickly packed up her wares, an(l made off&#xD;
as fast as she could waddle, in a great fright, nor did&#xD;
she stop on the way till she got to Sign ior Bacciuolo.&#xD;
XVhen Bacciuolo saw her, he eagerly asked how&#xD;
matters had gone with her-" Bad enough," said&#xD;
she, "I never was in such a fright. However, the&#xD;
case is, she will neither see nor hear you; and bad I&#xD;
not been pretty c~uick in making off, I should have&#xD;
had a sound beating. For my part, I will not go&#xD;
near her again, and I advise you to have nothing&#xD;
more to do with her."&#xD;
Bacciuolo was quite broken-hearted at this intel-&#xD;
&#xD;
ligence, and went to report it to the professor, and&#xD;
related the whole transaction. "Be not alarmed,&#xD;
B~tcciuolo, because the oak does not fall at the first&#xD;
stroke of the axe. There-go past the house this eve-&#xD;
ning, and observe with what sort of an eye she views&#xD;
thee; find out, by the kind of glance she casts upon&#xD;
thee, whether she be angry or no; then come and&#xD;
tell me." Bacciuolo went forth towards the lady's&#xD;
house. ~When she saw him, she instantly called her&#xD;
mai(l, and said to her, "Gpo after that young man,&#xD;
and tell him to come to speak to me this evening, and&#xD;
not to fail." So the maid went to him,~ and told him&#xD;
that the Lady Giovanna desired he would come that&#xD;
evening to her, as she wished to speak to him. Bac-&#xD;
ejuolo was in a strange surprise, but answered that&#xD;
he would most willingly do so; and then immediate-&#xD;
ly returned to the professor, and informed him of&#xD;
what had happened. The professor was a little stag-&#xD;
gered, for somehow or other a suspicion struck him&#xD;
)&#xD;
that it might be his own wife, and he thought to him-&#xD;
self, if it should !-And so it was in fact. "Well,"&#xD;
said he, "wilt thou go?"-" Certainly," said Bac-&#xD;
if     cinolo. "Well," said the professor, "when you do&#xD;
go, go straight from here." "Very well, so I will,"&#xD;
~aid~Bacciuo1o.&#xD;
This lady was~ the wife of the professor, but Bac-&#xD;
cinolo did not know that. The professor, however,&#xD;
began to feel uneasy; for, in the winter, he used to&#xD;
sleep at the college to lecture the students late in the&#xD;
evening, and his wife lived alone with her maid. "I&#xD;
would not," said the professor, "that this fellow&#xD;
should learn to make love at my expense~but I Will&#xD;
know further."&#xD;
Evening coming on, Bacciuolo came to him, say-&#xD;
ing, "Good Sir, I am going2'-" \Vell," said the&#xD;
professor, "speed be with you, but be wise." Bac-&#xD;
ciuolo said, "leave me alon&amp;amp;for that, you have not&#xD;
taught me for nothing," and went away. He had&#xD;
put on a good cuirassand provided himself with a&#xD;
stout rapier, and a stiletto in his girdle. WheD&#xD;

Bacejuolo was gone, the professor followed close at&#xD;
his heels, Baccinolo little thinking wborn he had got&#xD;
behind him. WI hen arrived at the door, he tapped&#xD;
gently, and the lady herself instantly let him in, and&#xD;
the professor saw, to his astonishment, that it really&#xD;
was his wife. "Oh! oh! I see," said he, "the feb&#xD;
low has made his progress at my cost;" and he began&#xD;
to think of killing him. He went back to the cob&#xD;
lege, bought a sword and a stiletto, returned furious-&#xD;
ly to the house, fully determined to make Signior,&#xD;
Bacciuolo pay for his instructions, and reaching the&#xD;
door, he began to knock loudly. The lady was seat-&#xD;
ed by the fire with Bacciuolo, and hearing the knock..&#xD;
ing, she immediately apprehended it might be her&#xD;
husband, and therefore concealed her lover under a&#xD;
1~eap of damp un-ironed linen which had been bun-&#xD;
(lied up in a corner near the window. She then r~n&#xD;
to the door, and demanded who was there. "Open&#xD;
the door, thou wicked woman," cried the professor&#xD;
from without, "and thou wilt soon know it." The&#xD;
lady opened the door, and, seeing him with a sword&#xD;
in his hand, exclaimed, "good heavens! what means&#xD;
this, my dear Sir?"-" Thou well knowest whom&#xD;
thou hast in the house," he said. "Good heavens,"&#xD;
cried the lady, "what is it you mean, are you mad?&#xD;
Look over the house," she said, " and if you find&#xD;
any one, I give you leave to execute your threats.&#xD;
How should I think of conducting myself otherwise&#xD;
than I always have done; beware, Sir, lest the evil&#xD;
spirit take possession of you, and lead you to destruc-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
The husband, having got a candle, went looking&#xD;
about all over the house; in the cellar, behind and&#xD;
under all the casks, butts, and indeed in every cor-.&#xD;
ner: then ran up stairs like a madman; searched every&#xD;
part of the room, but the right one; under the bed,&#xD;
thrust his sword into every square inch of thebed-&#xD;
ding, yet could he not find any thing. The lady,&#xD;
who stuck close to hi~n with a light in her hand, often&#xD;
repeated to him, "good master1 cross yourself, for&#xD;
&#xD;
assuredly the evil spirit is in you, and has tempted&#xD;
you to seek after what does not exist, for if I had the&#xD;
most distant thought of such wickedness, I would&#xD;
be the death of myself. rrherefore, I do entreat you&#xD;
not to suffer yourself to be seduced by such wicked&#xD;
thoughts." Upon which the professor, unable to&#xD;
find the object of his search, and hearing what the&#xD;
lady had said, began to think he was mistaken in his&#xD;
suspicions, and so put out the light, and returned to&#xD;
the college.&#xD;
The lady immediately brought out Bacciuolo from&#xD;
under the clothes, and lighted a large fire; put on it&#xD;
a famous fine capon to boil, and they pledged each&#xD;
other merrily, the lady often saying, "You see, my&#xD;
good little man has not found us out;" and so they&#xD;
cheerfully spent some hours together. In the morn-&#xD;
ing Bacciuolo went to the professor, and said, "Oh,&#xD;
my good sir! I will make you laugh." "How is&#xD;
that?" said the professor. "Last night, after I had&#xD;
been a short time at the lady's house, in came the&#xD;
husband, and though he hunted every where in search&#xD;
of me, he could not find me, for she had hidden me&#xD;
under a heap of damp linen, that were going to be&#xD;
dried: and the lady talked the poor fellow over so,&#xD;
that he soon went away; when we had a large capon&#xD;
for supper, drank some excellent wine, and had the&#xD;
best fun you can imagine, and I have promised to&#xD;
return again to night." " Be sure," sai(l the pro-&#xD;
fessor, "when you go this evening, to let me know."&#xD;
6    Bacciuolo answered he would, and left the profes.-'&#xD;
so]'.&#xD;
&#xD;
The professor meanwhile was in the utmost rage,&#xD;
and actually beside himself-so much so that he was&#xD;
not able 'to attend at the classes, he was so broken&#xD;
hearted. However, he consoled himself with the&#xD;
idea that he should catch him at night. So he pur-&#xD;
chased a breast plate, a light armour, and with his&#xD;
cuirass, rapier, and stiletto, cut quite a martial fig-&#xD;
ure. When the time came, Bacciuolo innocently&#xD;
went to the professor, and said, "I am going.~a&#xD;

THE TEACHER TAUGHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
"VVelI," said the professor, "go, and ~return TO-&#xD;
MOEIROW, and relate to me what may have happen.&#xD;
ed." "I will," said Baccinolo, and marched off to&#xD;
the lady's house. The professor put on his armour&#xD;
and followed Bacciuolo close at his heels, and thought&#xD;
of overtaking him at the door. The lady, who was&#xD;
upon the watch, opened the door quickly, let in her&#xD;
lover, and shut it again like lightning. When the&#xD;
professor reached the house he began to knock with&#xD;
all his might, making a tremendous noise. The lady&#xD;
in an instant put out the light, and made Baccinolo&#xD;
slide behind her, opened the door, and clasping her&#xD;
arms on the neck of her husband, whirled him round&#xD;
and gave Baccinolo an opportunity of slipping out;&#xD;
at the same time crying, "help! help! the man is&#xD;
mad, the man is mad;" still holding the poor gentle-&#xD;
man tight round the waist. The neighbours, upon&#xD;
hearing the noise, ran out, and seeing the professor&#xD;
thus armed at all points, with his huge breast-plate,&#xD;
cuirass, helmet, long rapier, and stiletto, and the&#xD;
lady crying out, "Hold him, hold him, he is mad;&#xD;
he has cracked his brain with study;" thought it was&#xD;
really true, and that he had lost his wits. They&#xD;
began fo say to him, "what means all this, good&#xD;
Signior? go to bed and rest-do not torment yourself&#xD;
in this way." " How can I rest," he shouted,&#xD;
"when this wicked woman is harbouring a man in&#xD;
the house? I saw him go in with my own eyes."&#xD;
"Oh wretched woman that I am," cried the lady,&#xD;
"ask these neighbours, all, whether they have ever&#xD;
witnessed improper conduct in me." They all with&#xD;
one voice answered, both men and women-" Do not&#xD;
think, Signior, so base a thing, for never was a bet-&#xD;
ter woman born than this lady-more virtuous or&#xD;
more decorous." "How !" said the professor, '~ why&#xD;
I saw the man enter the house. and I am sure he is&#xD;
in it now."&#xD;
In the mean time two of the lady's brothers arriv~&#xD;
ed, and when she saw them, she burst into tears&#xD;
and said, my dear brothers! this husband of mine is&#xD;
2~Z4&#xD;
&#xD;
raving mad, ~and will have it that I have a man in&#xD;
the house, and wants to be the death of me, ~nd yo~i&#xD;
well know whether I am a woman likely to fall into&#xD;
such abominations." The brothers said to the arm-&#xD;
ed philosopher, who foamed at the mouth with rage,&#xD;
"we marvel much, Sir, that you should dare suspect&#xD;
a sister of ours of such an act, and wonder what can&#xD;
make you dream of such a thing, having lived with&#xD;
her so long." "I tell you," said the professor, "that&#xD;
there is a man in the house, and I have si~r~ him."&#xD;
"VVell !" said the brothers, "let us hunt him out,&#xD;
and if he is found here, we will give her such a les-&#xD;
son as shall make you full amends." One ofthe&#xD;
brothers drew the lady aside, and said, "Hast thou&#xD;
in truth really got any one in the house I" "Alas !"&#xD;
said the lady, "heaven forbid! may I die before I&#xD;
harbour such thought as no woman 6f our family was&#xD;
ever guilty of. Art thou not ashamed to put such a&#xD;
question?" Upon which the brother felt quite hap-&#xD;
py, and the three went up to search. The professor&#xD;
directly made for the damp linen, pulled th'~m about,&#xD;
and stabbed them through and through in every di-&#xD;
rection, hardly leaving an inch through which he&#xD;
did not stick his sword, and the while taunting and&#xD;
insulting Bacciuolo as if he had actually been under&#xD;
them. "Well," said the lady, "did I not tell you&#xD;
he was mad? see how he spoils the linen: thou hast&#xD;
not been at the trouble of getting them up-that is&#xD;
very clear." The brothers then began to think he&#xD;
was truly mad, and after seeking eve ry where, and&#xD;

THE VENTRILOQ~UIST.&#xD;

Heaven guard thee, for I have learned so much,&#xD;

I return back to my home as fast as my legs can&#xD;

ANECDOTE OF A VENTRILOQUi5T.&#xD;

had nearly broken the sticks on his back, they bound&#xD;
him for a madman, telling every body that he had&#xD;
cracked his brain by intense study, and so they tied&#xD;
him up all night. In the morning they sent for the&#xD;
doctor, who ordered him to be put to bed by a fire,&#xD;
and desired that be should not speak to any one, or&#xD;
any one to him, and that particular attention should&#xD;
be paid to his diet, till he recovered his senses.&#xD;
The news that the Signior had gone mad soon&#xD;
spread all over Bologna; every body was much con-&#xD;
cerned. Some said, "I suspected it would be so, for&#xD;
he could not attend the lectures the other day."&#xD;
Others said, "I thought it would be so, I observed&#xD;
him so materially altered of late." The report was&#xD;
universally credited, and many went to see him.&#xD;
Bacciuolo unacquainted with what had taken place,&#xD;
went in the morning to the college, with the inten-&#xD;
tion of telling the professor of his adventure; but on&#xD;
reaching the place, he was told how the Signior had&#xD;
become mad. Bacciuolo wondered at this, and was&#xD;
very sorry for it, and went to see him with the rest,&#xD;
and being arrived at the house, Bacciuolo began to&#xD;
be staggered, and almost fainted, seeing how things&#xD;
stood~ but in order to prevent any one noticing how&#xD;
affected he was, be 'went in with them, and on reach-&#xD;
ing the apartment, he saw the Signior all over brui-&#xD;
ses, and chained to the bed. All the Students began&#xD;
to condole 'with him, and express their sorrow at&#xD;
seeing him in such a state. Bacciuolo's turn com-&#xD;
ing, he said, "good Signior, I am as much grieved at&#xD;
your situation, as though you were my father; and if&#xD;
I can do any thing to relieve you, Iprayyoudeal&#xD;
with me as if I were your son." Upon which the&#xD;
professor answered, "Bacciuclo, Bacciuolo, 1 p~'~y&#xD;
thee go in peace, for thou' hast learned much at my&#xD;
cost." The lady prevented farther discourse, by&#xD;
saying, "do not minil him, for he has lost his wits,&#xD;
and does not know what he says." f~acciuolo then&#xD;
departed; and came to Paolo, ard said, "Brother,&#xD;

and who modify their voice so as to make it appear to&#xD;

selves seem unconnected with what is passing, are&#xD;

Louis Brabant was valet-de-chambre to Francis&#xD;
I. and accosted a widow, with whose daughter (a&#xD;
rich and handsome heiress) he was in love, in a&#xD;
voice perfectly resembling that of her dead hus-&#xD;
band, exclaiming, "Give my daughter in marr~a ge&#xD;
to Louis Brabant. I now endure the inexpressible&#xD;
torments of purgatory, for having refused her to him;&#xD;
you will thus provide a worthy husband for your&#xD;
daughter, and procure everlasting repose to the soul&#xD;
of your poor husband."&#xD;
The widow could not, for a moment, resist so&#xD;
dreadful a summons, but immediately received Louis&#xD;
4      for her son-in-law; when the formalities of his mar-&#xD;
riage rendering it necessary for him to exhibit some&#xD;
show of riches, he contracted an intimate acquaint-&#xD;
ance 'with one Cornu, an old 'and rich banker at&#xD;
Lyons, and during an interval of silence, after a&#xD;
preparatory conversation on demons and spectres, a&#xD;
voice was heard, which, to the astonished banker,&#xD;
seemed to be that of his deceased father.&#xD;
It complained, as in the former case, of his dread-&#xD;
ful situation in purgatory, and called upon his son,&#xD;
"to deliver him instantly, by putting into the hands&#xD;

AN ACCOUNT OF CAPTAIN JOHN UNDERHYLL-SELECT-&#xD;
ED FROM THE LIFE AND ADVENTUIIF'.5 OF DOCTOR&#xD;
UPDIKE UNDIIRIIILL.&#xD;
I DERIVE my birth from one of the first emigrants&#xD;
to New England, being lineally descended from Cap~&#xD;
lain .John Underhill, who came into the Massachu-&#xD;
setts in the year one thousand six hundred and thir-&#xD;
ty; of whoi~honourahle mention AS made by that ele-&#xD;
gant, accurate, and interesting historian, the Reve'.&#xD;
ren(l Jeremy Belknap, in his History of New&#xD;
Hampshire.&#xD;
My honoured ancestor had early imbibed an ar-&#xD;
(lent love of liberty, civil and religious, by his ser-&#xD;
vice as a soldier among the Dutch, in their glorious&#xD;
and successful struggle for freedom, with Philip the&#xD;
second of Spain; when, though quite a youth, he&#xD;
l~eld a commission in the Earl of Leieester's own&#xD;
troop of guards, who was then sent to the assistance&#xD;
ogthat brave people, by the renowned Queen Eliza-&#xD;
neth of England.&#xD;
The extravagant passion, which that princess was&#xD;
sul)posed to entertain for various male favourites,&#xD;
which occasioned the disgrace of one, and the pee-&#xD;
mature death of another, while it has furnished a&#xD;
darling theme to the novelist, and has been wept&#xD;
over in the tragic scene, has never yet received the&#xD;
sober sanction of the historian.&#xD;
A traditional family anecdote, while it places the&#xD;
affection of the queen for Leicester beyond doubt,&#xD;
may not be unpleasing to the learned reader, and&#xD;
may benefit the English historiographer.&#xD;
It is well known that this crafty queen, though&#xD;
repeatedly solicited, never efficaciously assisted the&#xD;
Netherlanders, until their affairs were apparently at&#xD;
the lowest ebb, and they in such desperate circum&#xD;
stances, as to offer the sovereignty of their country&#xD;
to her general, the Earl of Leicester. Captain Un&#xD;

derhill carried the dispatches to England, and de-&#xD;
dvered them at the office of Lord Burleigh. The&#xD;
same evening, the queen sent for the captain, an(l,&#xD;
with apparent perturb&amp;amp;ition, enquired of him, if he&#xD;
was the messenger from Leicester, and whether he&#xD;
had any prh~ate dispatches for her. He replied,&#xD;
that he had delivered all his letters to the Secretary,&#xD;
of State. She appeared much disappointed, and,&#xD;
after musing some time, said, "So Leicester wants&#xD;
to be a king."4 Underhill, who was in the general's&#xD;
con fidenc~, replied that the Dutch had indeed made?&#xD;
the offer of the sovereignty of their country to her&#xD;
gerieral-esteemi ng it a great honour, as they said,&#xD;
to have a subject of her grace for their sovereign.&#xD;
No, replied the queen, it is notihe'Dutch; they hate&#xD;
kings and their divine right; it is the proud Leices&#xD;
,ter, who yearns to be independent of his own&#xD;
sovereign, who moves this insolent proposal.-&#xD;
Tell him, from me, that he must learn to obey&#xD;
before he is fit to govern. Tell, him, added&#xD;
the queen, softening her voice, that obedience may&#xD;
make ,him a king indeed. Immediately after Cap-&#xD;
tain Underhill had taken the public despatches, the&#xD;
queen sent for him to her privy closet, recalled her&#xD;
verbal message, delivered him a letter for Leicestei',&#xD;
directed with her own hand, and a purse of one hun-&#xD;
dred crowns for himself' charging him to enclo~e&#xD;
the letter in lead, sink it in case of danger' in his&#xD;
passage by sea, and to deliver it privately. Ow the&#xD;
receipt of this letter, Leices~er was violently agi-&#xD;
tated, walked his chamber the whole of the ensuing&#xD;
night. Soon after, he resigned his command, and&#xD;
returned to England, animated by the brightest&#xD;
hopes of realizing the lofty suggestions of his ambi-&#xD;
tion. With him Captain Underbill returned, and&#xD;
upon the deceased of the Earl of Leicester, attached&#xD;
himself to the fortunes of the Earl of Essex, the un-&#xD;
fortunate successor to Leicester, in the queen's fa-&#xD;
vour. He accompanied 'that gallant nobleman in&#xD;
his successful attack upon Cadiz, and shared his&#xD;
230&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
&#xD;
ill fortune in his fepitless expedition against Tyr&#xD;
ronne, the rebel chief of the revolted clans of Ire-&#xD;
land; and, returning with the Earl into England,&#xD;
by his attachment to that imprudent nobleman, sal-&#xD;
lying into the streets of' London, in the 1)etty insur-'&#xD;
rection, which cost Essex his head, he was obliged&#xD;
to seek safety in Holland, until the accession of&#xD;
King James, in one thousand six hundred and three,&#xD;
when he applied for pardon, and leave to return to&#xD;
his native counti'y. But that monarch entertained&#xD;
such an exalted4 idea of the dignity of kings, and&#xD;
from policy, affected so great a veneration for the&#xD;
memory of his predecessor, that no interest of his&#xD;
friends could procure his par(lon for an offence,&#xD;
which, in this day and ~~ountry, would be consider-&#xD;
ed a simple rout or riot, and punished with a small&#xD;
fine, in that age of kingly glory was supposed to&#xD;
combine treason and blasphemy: treason against&#xD;
the queen in her political capacity, and blasphemy&#xD;
against her, as God's representative and vicegerent&#xD;
on earth.&#xD;
The reverend Mr. Rohinsonwith a number of other&#xD;
pious puritans, having fled from the persecuting fury&#xD;
of the English prelates, to Holland, in one thousand&#xD;
six hundred and three, he dwelt and communed&#xD;
with them a number of years. He was strongly so.&#xD;
elicited to go with Governor Carver, Elder Brewster,&#xD;
and the other worthies, part of Mr. Robinson's&#xD;
church, to the settlement of Plymouth, and had&#xD;
/        partly engaged with them, as their chief military&#xD;
officer; hut, Captain Miles Standish, his brave fellow&#xD;
soldier in the low countries, undertaking the busi-&#xD;
ness, he declined.&#xD;
How he joined Governor Winthrop, does not ap-&#xD;
pear, but he came over to New England with him,&#xD;
apd soon after we fin1l him disciplining the Boston&#xD;
militia, where he was held in such high estimation,&#xD;
t1~at he was chosen to represent that town in the&#xD;
general court; but, his ideas of religious toleration&#xD;
being more liberal than those around him, he lost&#xD;

his popularity, and was, on the twentieth of' Novem&#xD;
her, one thousand six hundred and thirty seven, dis&#xD;
franchised and eventually banished the jurisdictioui&#xD;
of Massachusetts&#xD;
The writers of those times differ, as to the par-&#xD;
ticular offence for which he was punished. Some&#xD;
say it was for holding the Antinornian tenets of the&#xD;
celebrated Ann Hatchinson, others that the charge&#xD;
against him was for saying, That the government at&#xD;
Bost~~ were as zealous as the SC)'ibes and phariseeg,&#xD;
and as Paul before his conversion The best ac-&#xD;
count I h~ive been able to collect, is, that at the time&#xD;
when the zeal of our worthy forefathers burned the&#xD;
hottest against heretics and sectaries, when good&#xD;
Roger XVilliams, who settled Providence, the pious&#xD;
~Vheelwright, and others, were banished, he, with&#xD;
about sixty other imprudent persons, who did not&#xD;
believe in the then popular arguments, of fines, mi-&#xD;
prisonment, disfranchisement confiscation, banish-&#xD;
ments, arid halters, for the conversion of infidels,&#xD;
Supposed that the Christian faith, which had spread&#xD;
SO wonderfully in its infancy, when the Sword of&#xD;
civil power was drawn against it, in that age, sur-&#xD;
rounded by numerous proselites, needed n~ot the&#xD;
same sword unsheathed in its favour. These mis-~&#xD;
taken people signed a remonstrance against the vio-&#xD;
lent Proceedings, which were the order of that (lay.&#xD;
William Aspinwall and John Co ggeshe 11, two of the&#xD;
Boston representatives who signed the remon&#xD;
strance, were sent home, and the town ordered to&#xD;
choose others in their room. Some of the remon~&#xD;
strands recanted, some were fined, some were dis..&#xD;
franchised, and others, among whom was Captain&#xD;
Underhill, were banished.&#xD;
It is said, by some authors, that he was charged&#xD;
with the heinous crime of adultery, and that he&#xD;
even confessed it. The candid American author,&#xD;
above named, has fallen into this error. As I am&#xD;
Sure it must have given him pain to speak cvii even&#xD;
&#xD;
CAPTAIN UNDERHILL.&#xD;
of the dead, so I am certain he will rectify thi3 mis-&#xD;
take in the next edition of his invaluable history.&#xD;
That author informs us, page forty-three of his&#xD;
first volume, "That he, Captain Underhill, was pri-&#xD;
irately dealt with, on suspicion of adultery, which&#xD;
he disregarded, and therefore, on the next sabbath,&#xD;
was questioned for it, before the church; but the&#xD;
evidence not being sufficient to convict him, the.&#xD;
church could only admonish him."-Page forty-five,&#xD;
"He ivent to Boston, and in the same public manner&#xD;
acknowledged his adultery. But his confession was&#xD;
mixed with so many excuses and extenuations, that&#xD;
it gave no satisfaction."&#xD;
The unwary reader would perhaps conclude, that&#xD;
actual adultery was intended, as w~1l a'~ expressed,&#xD;
in these extracts. The reverend author himself,&#xD;
did not advert to the idea, that the moral law of&#xD;
Boston, in one thousand six hundred and thirty&#xD;
seven, was not so lax as the moral law of the same&#xD;
place, in one thousand seven hundred afl(I eighty&#xD;
four, as explained by the practice of its inhabitants.&#xD;
The rigid discipline of our fathers of that era,&#xD;
often construed actions, expressions, and sometimes&#xD;
thoughts, into crimes; which actions, in this (lay,&#xD;
even the most precise would consider either inno-&#xD;
cent, indifferent, or beneath the dignity of official&#xD;
notice. The fact is, that Captain Ijndeihill, so far&#xD;
from confessing, was never charged with coin emitting&#xD;
actual statute book adultery. At a certain lecture&#xD;
in Boston, instead of noting the referred texts in his&#xD;
bible, according to the profitable custom oft he times,&#xD;
this gallant soldier had fixed his eyes steadfastly, and&#xD;
~erhapsinordinately, upon one Mistress Miriam&#xD;
herself ~, who, it seems, was, at that very time,&#xD;
in the breach of the spirit of an existing law,&#xD;
which forbade women to appear in 1)ublic with un~&#xD;
covered arms and necks, by appearing at the same&#xD;
lecture with a pair of wanton open worked gloves,&#xD;
slit at the thumbs and fingers, for the convenlency&#xD;
of taking snuff; though she was not charged with&#xD;

Boston, 28th 4th month, 1683.&#xD;
It is ivith great reluctance I am induced to pub-&#xD;
lish this letter, which appears to reflect upon the&#xD;
justice of the proc~'dings of our forefathers. I&#xD;
would rather, like the sons of Noah; go backwards,&#xD;
~ When our forefathers first came to Boston, they found this&#xD;
William Blaxton in the possession of the site, where the town&#xD;
now stands. The general court, April 1st, 1633, granted him&#xD;
fifty acres of land, near where his house stood; supposed to be&#xD;
where the pest house in Boston formerly stood.-He afterwards&#xD;
removed to Rhode Island, and lived near Whipple's bridge in&#xD;
Cumbprland.-He planted the first orchard in that district, the&#xD;
fruit of which was eaten of one hundred and fo~ty years after&#xD;
wards, and some of the trees are now standirig2 lie had been&#xD;
a minister of the church of En~zland, preached often at Provi.&#xD;
dence, and died in a good old age, ro uch lamented.&#xD;
236&#xD;
&#xD;
and east a garment over our fathers' nakedness; but&#xD;
the impartiality of a historian, and the natural soli&#xD;
citude to wipe the stains from the memory of my&#xD;
honoured ancestor, will excuse me to the candid.&#xD;
Whoever reflects upon the piety of our forefathers,&#xD;
the noble unrestrained ardour, with which they re-&#xD;
sisted oppression in England, relinquished the de-&#xD;
lights of their native country, crossed a boisterous&#xD;
ocean, penetrated a savage wilderness, encountered&#xD;
famine, pestilence, and Indian warfare, and trans-&#xD;
mitted to us their sentiments of independence, that&#xD;
love of liberty, which, under God, enabled us to ob-&#xD;
tain our own, glorious freedom, will readily pass over&#xD;
those few dark spots of zeal, which clouded their&#xD;
rising sun.&#xD;
When the sentence of banishment was passed on&#xD;
Captain Underhill, he returned to Dover, in New&#xD;
Hampshire, and was elected governor of the Euro-&#xD;
pean settlers there' but, notwithstanding his great&#xD;
service to the peop1~ of Massachusetts, in the Pe-&#xD;
quod wars, his persecutors in Boston would not at-&#xD;
low him to die in peace. First, by writing injuri-&#xD;
ous letters to those he governed; by threats of their&#xD;
power; and lastly, by determining that Dover was&#xD;
within the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, they forced&#xD;
him to flee to Albany, then possessed by the Dutch,&#xD;
under the name of Amboyna.&#xD;
The Dutch were highly pleased with the Captain,&#xD;
and after Dutchifying his nafl~e into Captain Hans&#xD;
Van Vanderhill, they gave him a command of one&#xD;
hundred and twenty men, in their wars with the&#xD;
natives, It is said that he killed one hundred and&#xD;
fifty Indians on Long Island, and upwards of three&#xD;
hundred on the Main. The laurels of the famous&#xD;
Colonel Church wither in comparison. The Dutch&#xD;
granted him fifty thousand acres of land, then in&#xD;
their possession. Although the English, when they&#xD;
took possession of that country for the Duke of York,&#xD;
afterwards James the Second, had promised to quiet&#xD;
the claims of the settlers; yet Captain Underhill, oi&#xD;

ANECDOTE OF THE EMPEROR JOSEPH I!.&#xD;
&#xD;
QNJ~ day, as the emperor was walking in the&#xD;
Prater, at Vienna, as he often does alone, without&#xD;
any suite, he met a young woman, whom he did not&#xD;
know, and who seemed in great affliction; I think&#xD;
she was even lamenting her fate very bitterly~,~vith~&#xD;
out suspecting by whom she was overheard. Joseph&#xD;
approached her, and inquired into the cause of her&#xD;
lamentations.. The young woman, perceiving a per-&#xD;
son unknown to her, who seemed to take an interest&#xD;
in her sorrows, related to him, with much simple&#xD;
city, thatcher father, an officer in-~--l know not what&#xD;
regiment, having been killed in the service of the&#xD;
empress-queen, her mother, having no one to pro&#xD;
288&#xD;
&#xD;
JOSEPH 11.&#xD;
&#xD;
his posterity, nave never availed themselves of the&#xD;
grant.-Mentioning this circumstance, sometime&#xD;
since, in Hartford, some gentlemen immediately of..&#xD;
fered to raise a company a~nd purchase my right. 1&#xD;
candidly confessed that I was r~ot 1)O55eS5e(l of the&#xD;
title, and knew not the particular spot where the&#xD;
land lay, and consequently was unwlllLng to sell&#xD;
land without fitle or boundaries. To my surprise,&#xD;
they laughed at my scruples, and observed that they&#xD;
wanted the land to speculate upon, to seii, and not&#xD;
to settle. Titles and boundaries, in such cases, I&#xD;
understood, were indifferent matters, mere trifles.&#xD;
My brave ancestor, at an advanced ,age, die(l in&#xD;
Albany, leaving two sons; the youngest ol whom re-&#xD;
moved to the mouth of the Hudson, where some of&#xD;
his posterity flourish respectably to this day. The&#xD;
eldest son, Benoni, from whom I am descended,&#xD;
some years after his father's decease, after being the&#xD;
subject of various misfortunes, return ed, inimpover&#xD;
ished circumstances, to New Hampshire, where the&#xD;
family have continued ever since.&#xD;
&#xD;
tect hr, or take any interest in her behalf, had fall.&#xD;
en into great distress, and this had been considera-&#xD;
bly increased by the late scarcity. She added,&#xD;
that having been supported principally by the work&#xD;
of their own han&amp;amp;~;, this resource was now about to&#xD;
fail, since the hardness of the times, daily diminish-&#xD;
ed the number of those by whom their works could&#xD;
be purchased, so that she was fearful they might&#xD;
soon be reduced to the utmost misery. The em-&#xD;
peror inquired whether they had ever received any&#xD;
assistance from the government?-She answered,&#xD;
none.-He then inquired why her mother had never&#xD;
thought of soliciting the emperor for relief, as he was&#xD;
so easy of access?-They say he is avaricious, she&#xD;
replied, and we therefore thought that such a step&#xD;
would be useless. The monarch profited by the les-&#xD;
son thus innocently given him; he gave the young&#xD;
woman some ducats and a ring, telling her that he&#xD;
had . the honour of being in the emperor's service,&#xD;
and would endeavor to recommend her to his ma-&#xD;
jesty. He then appointed a day and an hour, on which&#xD;
he desired her to come, with her mother, to the em-&#xD;
peror's apartments, as he should be on duty that&#xD;
day, and. he hoped he might be able to bring her&#xD;
some good news. He added that she need only&#xD;
present the ring he had given her, she would then&#xD;
be admitted into the emperor's private apartment,&#xD;
where, he concluded, you will find me. The young&#xD;
woman thought she had been talking to a tutelary&#xD;
angel, nor was she mistaken, and, hastening home,&#xD;
immediately imparted the fortunate adventure she&#xD;
had met with to her mother. The emperor, in the&#xD;
mean time, mjde inquiries into the truth of the&#xD;
young woman's story, and finding it confirmed, he&#xD;
waited for the moment he had appointed to receive&#xD;
her in his private apartment. She did not fail to&#xD;
con~ie, with her mother, in hopes of finding her&#xD;
benefactor, and returning him the ring~; she, indeed,&#xD;
knew him again, the moment she saw him, but at&#xD;
the same time, she perceived, by the respect paid&#xD;

him, that it was the emperor himself. She then&#xD;
called to mind, what she had said on the subject of&#xD;
his avarice, and turned pale with apprehension.&#xD;
His imperial majesty bade her not be alarmed; and&#xD;
then, informing, the mother that he had settled a&#xD;
pension upon he~, from the army funds, he turned to&#xD;
the daughter, ai~d said: Bnother time I hope you will&#xD;
not despair of a het*rt that is just; words worthy of&#xD;
being enrolled in the archives of humanity.&#xD;

MESSER Basilio, of Milan, who had fixed his re*&#xD;
sidence in Pisa, on his return from Paris, where he&#xD;
had pursued the study of physic, having accumulat-&#xD;
ed, by industry and extraordinary skill, a good for-.&#xD;
tune, married a young woman of Pisa, of very ~4en-&#xD;
der fortune, and fatherless and motherless; by her&#xD;
he had three soils, and a daughter who in due time&#xD;
was married in Pisa; the eldest son was likewise&#xD;
married, the younger one was at school; the middle&#xD;
one, whose name was Lazarus, although great- sums&#xD;
had been spent upon his education, made nothing of&#xD;
it; he was naturally idle and stupid, of a s6ur and&#xD;
melancholy disposition; a man of few words, and&#xD;
obstinate to such a degree, that if once he had said&#xD;
ItlO to any thing, nothing upon earth could make him&#xD;
alter his mind. His father, finding him so extreme-&#xD;
ly troublesome, determined to get rid of him, and&#xD;
sent h~m t~ a beautiful estate he had lately bought&#xD;
at a small distance from town. There he lived con-&#xD;
tented, more proud of the society of clowns and clod-&#xD;
poles, than the acquaintance of civilized people.&#xD;
\Yhile Lazarus was t.hus living quietly in his own&#xD;
way, ther~ happened about ten years after, a dread..&#xD;
ful mortality in Pisa; people were seized with a vio-&#xD;
lent fever, they then fell into a sleep suddenly, and&#xD;
died in that state. The disease was catching; Ba-&#xD;
siho, as well as other physicians, exerted their ut-&#xD;

TWO PAILS OF WATER.&#xD;
TirE Royal Society, on the day of its creation,&#xD;
was thewhet$one of the wit of their patron, Charles&#xD;
11. With a peculiar gravity of countenance, he&#xD;
proposed to the assembly the following question, for&#xD;
their solution :-" Suppose two pails of water were&#xD;
fixed in two different scales, ecpally poised, and&#xD;
which weighed equally ~ilike, and that two live&#xD;
bream, or small lish, were put into either of these&#xD;
pails, he wanted to know the reason why that pail,&#xD;
~with such addition, should not weigh more than the&#xD;
other pail which stood against it."-Every one was&#xD;
ready, to set at quiet the royal curiosity; but it ap-&#xD;
peared that every one was giving a different opi-&#xD;
nion. One, at length, offered so ridiculous a solution&#xD;
that another of the members could not refrain from&#xD;
a loud laugh; when the King, turning to him, insist&#xD;
ed that he should give his sentiments as well as the&#xD;
rest. This he did without hesitation, and told his&#xD;
Majesty, in plain terms, that he denied the fact.&#xD;
On which the King, in high mirth, exclaimed,&#xD;
"Odds fish, brother, you are in the right !"&#xD;

death, except an old woman servant. The raging&#xD;
disease having ceased at last, Lazarus was induced&#xD;
to return to Pisa, where he inherited the extensive&#xD;
estates and riches of his father. Man~r were the ef-&#xD;
forts niade by the different families to induce him to&#xD;
marry their daughters, notwithstanding they were&#xD;
aware of his boorish disposition; but nothing would&#xD;
avail. He said he was resolved to wait four years&#xD;
before he would marry; so0that his obstinate dispo-&#xD;
sition being well known, they ceased their importu-&#xD;
nities. Lazarus, intent upon pleasing himself alone,&#xD;
would not associate with any living soul. There&#xD;
was, however, one poor man, named Gabrie l,~who&#xD;
lived in a small house opposite to him, with his wife&#xD;
Dame Santa. This poor fellow was an excellent&#xD;
fisherman and birdcatcher, mad~ nets, &amp;amp;c. and what&#xD;
with that, and the assistance or his wife, who spun,&#xD;
he made ~shift to keep his family, consisting~ of two&#xD;
children, a boy of five; ai~d a girl of three years old.&#xD;
Now it happened that this Gabriel was a perfect&#xD;
likeness of Lazarus; both were red haired, had the&#xD;
same length of beard, every feature, size, gait, and&#xD;
voice so perfectly alike, that one would have sworn&#xD;
they were twins;, and had they both been dressed&#xD;
alike, certainly no one but would have mistaken the&#xD;
one for the other; the wife herself would have been /&#xD;
receivedd, but for the clothes-those of Lazarus be-&#xD;
in g fine cloth, and her husband's of coarse wool of a&#xD;
different colour. Lazarus, observing this extraor-&#xD;
dinary resemblance, could not help fancying that&#xD;
there must be something~ in it, and began to famil-&#xD;
iarise himself with his society, sent his wife presents&#xD;
of eatables, wines, &amp;amp;c. and often invited Gabriel to&#xD;
dinner or supper with.him. Gabriel, though poor and&#xD;
untaught, was shrewd and. sagacious, and knew well&#xD;
how to get on the blind side of any one; he so hu-&#xD;
moured him, that at last Lazarus could not rest an&#xD;
instant without his company. One day, after din-&#xD;
ner, they entered into conversation on the subject of&#xD;
fishing, and the different modes of catching fish, and&#xD;
242&#xD;
&#xD;
4i1,i&#xD;
4..&#xD;
&#xD;
at last came to the fishing by diving with small netu&#xD;
fastened to the neck and arms; and Gabriel told hin*&#xD;
of the immense numbers of large fish which were&#xD;
caught in that manner, insomuch that Lazarus be-&#xD;
came very anxious to know how one could fish div.~&#xD;
ing, and begged of him to let him see how he (lid it.&#xD;
Upon which Gabriel said he was very willing, and&#xD;
it being a hot summer's day, they might easily take&#xD;
the sport, if he too were willing. Having risen from&#xD;
table, Gabriel marched out, fetched his nets, and.&#xD;
away they went. They arrived on the borders of&#xD;
the Arno, in a shady place surrounded by elders;&#xD;
there he requested Lazarus to sit and look on. After&#xD;
stripping, and fastening the nets about him, he div~.&#xD;
ed ip the river, and being very expert at the sport, he&#xD;
soon rose again with eight or ten fish of terrible size&#xD;
in his nets. Lazarus could not think how it ~vas&#xD;
possible to catch so many fish under water; it so as-&#xD;
tonished him, that he determined to try it himselC.&#xD;
The day was broiling hot, and he thought it would&#xD;
cool him. By the assistance of Gabriel he undressed,&#xD;
and the latter conducted him in at a pleasant part&#xD;
of the shore, where the water was scarcely knee&#xD;
deep. There he left him with nets, giving him&#xD;
charge to go no farther than the stake which he point..&#xD;
ed oat to him. Lazarus, who had never before been&#xD;
in the water, was delighted at its coolness, and ob-&#xD;
serving how often Gabriel rose up with nets full of&#xD;
fish, bethought himself one must see under as well&#xD;
~ above water, otherwise it would be impossible to&#xD;
catch the fish ifl the dark, therefore, in order to as-&#xD;
certain the point, without thinking of consequences,&#xD;
he put his head under water, and dashed forward&#xD;
beyond the stake. Down he went like a piece of&#xD;
lead; not aware lie should hpld his breath and know-&#xD;
ing nothing of swimming, he struggled hard to raise&#xD;
himself above the surface. He was almost stifled&#xD;
with the water he had swallowed, and was carried&#xD;
away by the current so that he very shortly lost&#xD;
his senses. Gabriel, who was very busy watchingg a&#xD;

THE COUNTERPARTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
great )leal of fish in a very good place, did not care&#xD;
to leave it; there fore, poor Lazarus, after rising half&#xD;
dead two or three times, sunk at last never to rise&#xD;
again. Gabriel, after he had got as much fish as he&#xD;
thought would do for him, joyfully turned round to&#xD;
show Lazarus his sport; he looked round and did&#xD;
not see him, he then sought him every where, but&#xD;
not finding him, he became quite alarmed, and ter.-&#xD;
rifled at the sight of the poor fellow's clothes that&#xD;
were laid on the bank. He dived, and sought the&#xD;
body, and found it at last driven by the current on&#xD;
the beach- at the sight he almost lost his senses; he&#xD;
stood motionless, not knowing what to do, for he&#xD;
feared, that in relating the truth, people would think&#xD;
it was all a lie, and that he had drowned him, him-&#xD;
self, in order to gethis money. Driven thus almost&#xD;
to despair, a thought struck him, and he determined&#xD;
to put it in instant execution. There was no wit..&#xD;
ness to the fact, for every one was asleep, it being&#xD;
the heat of the day; he, therefore, took the fish, and,&#xD;
put them safe in a basket, and for that purpose, took&#xD;
the dead body on his shoulders, heavy as it was, laid&#xD;
him on some grass, put his own breeches on the dead&#xD;
limbs, untied the nets from his own arms, and tied&#xD;
them tight to the arms of the corpse. This done, he&#xD;
took hold of him, dived into tho water, and tied him&#xD;
fast with the nets to the stake inder water. He&#xD;
then came on shore, slipped on Lazarus' shirt, and&#xD;
all his clothes, and even Ii is fine shoes, and sat him-&#xD;
self down on a bank, determining to try his luck&#xD;
first in saving himself from his perilous situation,&#xD;
and next to try whether he might not, from his ex-&#xD;
treme likeness to Lazarus, make his fortune and live&#xD;
at ease. Being a bold and sagacious fellow, he im-&#xD;
mediately undertook the daring and dangerous ex-&#xD;
periment, and began to cry out with all his might&#xD;
and main, "Oh-! good people, help! help! run afl(l&#xD;
help the poor fisherman, who is drowning." He&#xD;
roared out so, that at last the miller, who lived n&amp;amp;&#xD;
far oW~ came running with I know not how many of&#xD;
244&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
~I'~I ~I&#xD;
~Ii&#xD;
&#xD;
his men. Gabriel spoke with a gruff voice, the bets&#xD;
~r to imitate that of Lazarus, and weepingly relat.&#xD;
ed that the fisherman, after diving and catching a&#xD;
good de~l of' fish, had gone aAain, and that ashe had&#xD;
been a~ ove an hour under water, he was afraid be&#xD;
was drowned; they, enquiring what part of the river&#xD;
he had gone to, he showed them the stake and place.&#xD;
The miller, who could swim very well, rushed in&#xD;
towards the stake, and found the corpse, but being&#xD;
unable to extricate it from the stake, rose up again&#xD;
and cried out, "Oh l yes he is dead sure enough, but&#xD;
I cannot get him up by myself:" upon which tivo&#xD;
others stripped, and got the body~out, whose arms&#xD;
and limbs were lacerated by the nets, which (as&#xD;
they thought) had entangled him, and calmed his&#xD;
death. The news being spread abroad, a priest&#xD;
came, the corpse was put in a coffin and carried to a&#xD;
small church, that it might be owned by the family&#xD;
of Gabriel. The dreadful news had already reached&#xD;
Pisa, and the unfortunate wife, with her weeping&#xD;
children, came to the church, and there beholding&#xD;
her beloved husband, as she thought, she hung over&#xD;
him, wept; sobbed, tore her hair, and l)ecame al-&#xD;
most frantic, insomuch that the bystanders were&#xD;
moved to tears. Gabriel, who was a most loving&#xD;
husband and father, could scarce refrain fiorn weep-&#xD;
ing; and seeing the extreme affliction of his wife,&#xD;
came forward, keeping Lazarus' hat over his eyes,&#xD;
and his handkerchief to his face as it were to wipe&#xD;
away his tears, and approaching the widow, who&#xD;
took him, as well as others, for Lazarus, he said, in&#xD;
the hearing of the people, "good woman, do not giie&#xD;
way to such sorrow, nor weep so, for I will not for-.&#xD;
sake you; as it was to oblige me, and afford me plea-.&#xD;
sure, that he went a fishing to-day against his incli-&#xD;
nation, methinks it is partly to me he owed his death,&#xD;
therefore I will ever be a friend to thee and thine;&#xD;
al~ expenses shall be paid, therefore return home and&#xD;
be comforted, for while I live thou shalt never want,&#xD;
and should I die I will leave thee enough to make&#xD;

thee as comfortable as any of thy equals." Thus he&#xD;
went on, weeping and sobbing, as if regretting the&#xD;
loss of Gabriel, and really agonized by the distress&#xD;
of his widow. He was inwardly praised by all pre..&#xD;
sent, who believed him to be Lazarus.&#xD;
The poor widow, after the funeral was performed,&#xD;
returned to Pisa, much comforted by the promises&#xD;
of him, whom she considered as her neighbour Laza-&#xD;
rus. Gabriel, who had been long acquainted with&#xD;
the deceased's ways, manners, and mode of living,&#xD;
entered Lazarus' house, as if the master of it; with-&#xD;
out uttering a syllable, ascended into a very beauti-&#xD;
ful room that looked over a fine garden, pulled out&#xD;
of the dead man's coat he had on a bunch of keys,&#xD;
and opened several chests, and finding some smaller&#xD;
keys, he opened several desks., bureaus, and money&#xD;
chests, and found, independent of trunks filled with&#xD;
cloth, linen and jewel~, which the old father, the&#xD;
physician, and brothers of the deceased had left,&#xD;
Early to the value of two thousand gold forms, and&#xD;
four hundred of silver. He was in raptures all the&#xD;
night, and began to think of the best means to con-&#xD;
ceal himself from the servants, and appear as the&#xD;
real Lazarus. About the hour of supper he came&#xD;
out of his room, weeping; the servants, who had&#xD;
he~xrd the dreadful situation of the Widow Santa,&#xD;
and that it was reported that their master had partly&#xD;
been the cause of the accident, were not much sur-&#xD;
prised at seeing hinvthus afflicted, thinking it was&#xD;
on account of Gabriel. He called the servant and&#xD;
desired him to take a couple of loaves, two bottles&#xD;
of wine, and half his supper to the Widow Santa,&#xD;
the which the poor widow scarcely touched. When&#xD;
the servant returned, Gabriel ordered supper, but ate&#xD;
sparingly, the better to deceive the servants, as&#xD;
Lazarus was a very little eater; then left the room&#xD;
without saying a word, and shut himself up in his&#xD;
own room as the deceased used to do. The servants&#xD;
thought there was some alteration in his countenance&#xD;
and voice, but attributed it to the sorrowful event&#xD;
246&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
i t~&#xD;
&#xD;
that had occurred. The widow, after having tasted&#xD;
of the supper, and considering the care that had been&#xD;
taken of her, and the promises made hy Lazarus, be-&#xD;
gan to take comfort, parted with her relations, who&#xD;
had come to condole with her, and retired to bed&#xD;
Gabriel, full of thought, could not sleep a wink, and&#xD;
got up in the morning at Lazarus' usual hour, and&#xD;
in all things imitated him. But being informed by&#xD;
the servants that Santa was always in grief, weep-&#xD;
ing and discomforted, and being a fond husband, and&#xD;
loving her tenderly, he was miserable upon hearing&#xD;
this, and determined to comfort her. Thus resolved,&#xD;
one day after dinner he went to her, and found a&#xD;
cousin of her's with her. Having given her to un-&#xD;
derstand he had some private business with her, the&#xD;
cousin knowing how much she was indebted to him,&#xD;
and her expectations, left the room, and departed,&#xD;
saying, he begged she would he advised by her wor-&#xD;
thy neighbour.&#xD;
As soon as he was gone, he shut the door, went into&#xD;
his room and motioned her to follow; she, struck&#xD;
with the singularity of the case, and fearing for her&#xD;
honor, did not know what to do, whether she should,&#xD;
or she should not follow; yet thinking of his kindness,&#xD;
and the hopes she had from his liberality, and taking&#xD;
her eldest son by the hand, she went into the room,&#xD;
where she found him lying on a little bed, on whicE&#xD;
her husband used to lie when tired; upon which she&#xD;
started and stopped. Gabriel, seeing her come with&#xD;
her son, smiled with pleasurable feelings at the pun..&#xD;
ty of his wife's conduct; one word that he uttered,&#xD;
which he was in the habit of using, staggered the&#xD;
poor Santa, so that she could not utter a syllable.&#xD;
Gabriel, pressing the poor boy to his breast, said,&#xD;
"thy mother weeps unaware of thy happy fate, her&#xD;
own, and her husband's." Yet not daring to trust&#xD;
himself before him, though but a child, he took him&#xD;
into the next room, gave him money to ~)lay with,&#xD;
and left him there. Returning to his wife, who had&#xD;
caught his words, and partly recognized him, he&#xD;

double-locked the door, and related to her Cl ery&#xD;
circumstance that bad happened, and how he had&#xD;
managed every thing; she, delighted and convinced&#xD;
from the repetition of certain family secrets, known&#xD;
to themselves alone, embraced him, giving him as&#xD;
m~ny kisses as she had bestowed tears for his death,&#xD;
for both were loving and tenderly attached. After&#xD;
reciprocal marks of each other's affection, Gabriel said&#xD;
to her that she must be perfectly silent, and pointed&#xD;
out to her how happy their life would hereafter prove;&#xD;
he told her of the riches he had found, and what h~&#xD;
intended to do, the which highly delighted her. In&#xD;
going out, Santa pretended to cry on opening the&#xD;
street door, and said aloud, that she might he heard&#xD;
by the neighbours, CC ~ recommend these poor father-&#xD;
less children to you, Signior!" to which he answered,&#xD;
"fear not, good Mrs. Santa," and walked away, full&#xD;
of thoughts on his future plans. When evening&#xD;
came on, observing the same uniform conduct of&#xD;
his predecessor, he went to bed, but could not sleep&#xD;
for thinking. No sooner did the dawn appear than&#xD;
he rose and went to the church of St. Catherine,&#xD;
where a devout and worthy pastor dwelt, and who&#xD;
was considered by all the Pisanians as a little saint:&#xD;
friar Angelico appearing, Gabriel told him he want.&#xD;
ed to speak to him on particular business, and to&#xD;
have his advice upon a very important and singular&#xD;
case that had happened to him. The kind fria rai.&#xD;
though he did not know him, led him into his room.&#xD;
Gabriel, who well knew the whole genealogy of&#xD;
Lazarus, son of Basilio of Milan, related it fully&#xD;
to the friar, likewise the dreadful accident,. ad ding,&#xD;
that he considered himself as a principal cause of it,&#xD;
making him believe it Was he who md aced the un-&#xD;
fortunate man to go a fishing against his will; he&#xD;
represented the mischief which resulted from it to&#xD;
the widow and children of the deceased, and that he&#xD;
considered himself so much the cause of it, and felt&#xD;
such a weight on his conscience, that~he had made&#xD;
up his mind, though Santa was of low condition, and&#xD;
243&#xD;
&#xD;
C&#xD;
&#xD;
poor, to take her for his wife, if she and her friends&#xD;
approved of it, and to take the children of the poor&#xD;
fisherman under his care as his own; bring them up&#xD;
with his own children, should he have any, and leave&#xD;
tuem co-heirs with them; this, he said, would recon-&#xD;
cile him to himself and his Maker, and be approv-&#xD;
ed by men. The holy man, seeing the worthy nio'.&#xD;
tives which acta~ted him, approved of his intention,&#xD;
and recommended as little delay as possible, since&#xD;
he would thereby meet with forgiveness. Gabriel, in&#xD;
order the more effectually to secure his ready co-&#xD;
operation, threw down thirty pieces of money, say-&#xD;
ing, that in the three succeeding Mondays he wished&#xD;
high mass to be sung for the soul of the deceased~&#xD;
At this tempting sight, the friar, although a very&#xD;
saint, leaped with joy, took the cash, and said, "my&#xD;
son, the masses shall be sung next Monday; there is&#xD;
nothing more to attend to now but the marriage, a&#xD;
ceremony which I advise thee to hasten as much as&#xD;
thou ~canst; do not think of riches or noble birth;&#xD;
thou art, thank heaven, rich enough; and as to birth,&#xD;
we are all children of one father; true nobility con-&#xD;
sists in virtue and the fear of God, nor is the good&#xD;
woman deficient in either; I know her well, and&#xD;
most of her relations." "Good father," said Gabriel,&#xD;
"I am come to you for the very purpose, therefore,&#xD;
I pray you, put me. quickly in the way to forward&#xD;
the business." "When will you give her the ring?"&#xD;
said the holy man. "This very day," he answered,&#xD;
"if she be inclined." "XYell," said the friar, "go&#xD;
thy ways, and leave all to me; go home, and stir not&#xD;
from thence-these blessed nuptials shall take place."&#xD;
Gabriel thanked him, received his blessing, and&#xD;
went home. The holy father carefully put the cash&#xD;
in his desk, then went to an uncle of Dame Santa, a&#xD;
shoemaker by trade, and a cousin of hers, a barber,&#xD;
and related to them what had happened; after which&#xD;
they went together to Dame Santa, and used every&#xD;
possil)le argument to persuade her to consent to the&#xD;
match, the which she feigned great difficulty in cou*&#xD;

THE DEATH OF CLEOPATRA.&#xD;
AFTER giving an account of the lives of Antony&#xD;
and Cleopatia, their amours, the victory of Augus-&#xD;
tus over Antony and the Egyptians, the burial of&#xD;
Antony by Vleopatra, and her mourning for him, the&#xD;
narrative thus concludes&#xD;
Then, as if her mourning was over, she ordered&#xD;
her women to prepare her bath; after the enjoyment&#xD;
of which, she arrayed herself in the richest manner,&#xD;
and partook ofthe~rnost splendid and magnificent ban-&#xD;
quets. She then ordered a basket of figs, which had&#xD;
been presented her by a countryman who was in her&#xD;
interest, to be brought her, under the leaves of which&#xD;
lay concealed an asp, the bite of which was mortal,&#xD;
but gave no pain, nor produced convulsion or distor&#xD;
tion of the frame: a gentle moisture only bedewed&#xD;
the countenance, the senses became obliterated, and&#xD;
an excessive heaviness oppressed the whole body,&#xD;
resembling that felt by persons who are under the&#xD;
influence of profound sleep. This treasure, which&#xD;
Cleopatra valued more than all her richest had been&#xD;
greedily and thankfully received, and concealed&#xD;

THE WRONG LEG.&#xD;
&#xD;
seating to, saying that it was merely for the advan-&#xD;
tare of her children that she submitted to ~ueh a&#xD;
thing. I will only add, that the very same moriiing,&#xD;
by the exertions of the friar, they were married a&#xD;
second time; great rejoicing took place, and Gabriel&#xD;
and his wife laughed heartily at the simplicity of the&#xD;
good friar, and the credulity of the relations and&#xD;
neighbours. They happily lived in peace and plen-&#xD;
ty, provided for and dismissed the old servants; were&#xD;
blessed with two more children, whom he named&#xD;
Fortunatus, and from whom afterward sprung some&#xD;
of the most renowned men, both in arms and let..&#xD;
ters.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE WRONG LEG.&#xD;
Dr. 7rhomas, (Bishop of Salisbury) forgot the day&#xD;
he was to be married, and was surprised at his ser~&#xD;
vants bringing him a new dress. A gnat stinging&#xD;
him in the leg, the doctor stooped and scratched the&#xD;
g of a gentleman who stood next to him.&#xD;
251&#xD;
&#xD;
from the piercing eyes of the guards with such sin-&#xD;
gular sw~crecy, that no doubt remained on the minds&#xD;
of her attendants, whom she now ordered to leave&#xD;
her apartment. Her favourite women, Charmion&#xD;
and Iras, who were too faithfully attached to their&#xD;
royal mistress to survive her, were now embraced,&#xD;
with great affection, in a last farewell. Cleopatra&#xD;
then, wun Roman fortitude, but divested of those&#xD;
fears of futurity which she would have experienced&#xD;
had she lived in this happy Christian land, placed&#xD;
the asp on her bosom: its anodyne, influence was&#xD;
soon experienced. The subtle poison entered her&#xD;
veins; and Cleopatra, the beautiful Ethiopian queen,&#xD;
expired; and the world closed on a princess whose&#xD;
talents and genius, had she enjoyed the privileges of&#xD;
a Christian education, would not have acknowledged&#xD;
a superior. Augustus sent messengers to fnquire&#xD;
into the health of Cleopatra, as had been usual with&#xD;
him. On entering the apartment of the Pagan prin-&#xD;
cess, they found her extended on her ottoman of gold,&#xD;
arrayed in all her royal ornaments. The asp was&#xD;
still at her bosom, but she appeared as under the in-&#xD;
fluence of a deep and placid sleep. Iras was alrea-&#xD;
dy dead; at the feet of Cleopatra was Charmion,&#xD;
just expi~iing, in the act of adjusting the imperial&#xD;
diadem of her royal mistress. A letter was in the&#xD;
hand of the queen, addressed to Augustus, in which&#xD;
she requested, as a last act of clemency, to be inter-&#xD;
red in the same tomb with Antony.&#xD;

THE CANARY BIRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
EUCRATES says that he became acquainted in&#xD;
Egypt with Pancrates, who had resided twenty years&#xD;
in the subterraneous recesses, where he had learned&#xD;
magic from Isis herself. "At length," be states, "lie&#xD;
persuaded me to leave all my servants at M~mpbis;&#xD;
and to follow him alone, telling me that we shouh~&#xD;
riot be at a loss for attendants. When we came into&#xD;
an inn, he took a wooden pin, latch, or bolt, and&#xD;
wrapping it in some clothes, when he had repeated&#xD;
a verse over it, he made it walk, and appear a ina~n&#xD;
to every one. This creature went about, prepared&#xD;
supper, laid the cloth, and waited upon us very dex-.&#xD;
terously. Then, when we bad no further occasion&#xD;
for it, by repeating another ve~se, he' turned it into&#xD;
a pin, latch, or bolt, again. He refused to impart&#xD;
the secret of this incantation to me, though very&#xD;
obliging in every thing else. But having hid myself&#xD;
one day in a dark corner, I caught the first verse,&#xD;
which consisted of three syllables. After he had&#xD;
given his orders to the pin, he went into the market&#xD;
place. Next day, in his absence, I took the pin,&#xD;
A    dressed it up, and repeating those syllables, ordered&#xD;
it to fetch some water. When it h~d brought a full&#xD;
jar, I cried, "Stop, draw no more water, but be a&#xD;
pin again." It was in vain, however, that he reite&#xD;
rated the command of as you were; the perverse&#xD;
I)in continued his employment till he had nearly fill&#xD;
ed the house. "I, not able to endure this obstinacy&#xD;
(continues Eucrates,) and fearing the return of my&#xD;
companion, lest he should be displeased, seized a&#xD;
hatchet, and split the pin in two pieces. But each&#xD;
part, taking up a jar, ran to draw more water, so&#xD;
that I had now two servants in place of one. In&#xD;
the mean time Pancrates returned, and, understand-&#xD;
ing the matter, changed them into wood again, as&#xD;
~they were before the incantation."&#xD;

[N the town of qleves, I was residing with a Pru-.&#xD;
sian family, during the time of the fair; which I&#xD;
shall pass over, having nothing remarkable to dis-&#xD;
tinguish it from other annual meetings, where peo-&#xD;
pie assemble to stare at, cheat each other, and di-&#xD;
vert themselves, and to spend the year's savings in&#xD;
buying those bargains which would have been pro-.&#xD;
bably better bought at home. One day after din..&#xD;
ner, as the dessert was just brought on the table, the&#xD;
travelling German musicians, who commonly ply&#xD;
the houses at these times, presented themselves, and&#xD;
were suffered to play; and just as they were rnak~&#xD;
ing their bows for the money they received for their&#xD;
harmony, a bird-catcher, who had rendered himself&#xD;
famous for educating and calling forth the talents of&#xD;
the feathered race, made his appearance, and was&#xD;
well received by our party, which was numerous&#xD;
and benevolent. The musicians, who had heard of&#xD;
this bird-catcher's fame, begged permission to stay&#xD;
and the master of the house, who had a great share&#xD;
of good-nature, indulged their curiosity: a Curiosity&#xD;
indeed, in which every body participated; for all&#xD;
that we have heard or seen of learned pigs, asses,&#xD;
dogs, and horses, was said to be extinguished in the&#xD;
wonderful wisdom which blazed in the genius of thi~'&#xD;
bird-catcher',s canary. The canary was produced,&#xD;
and the owner harangued him in the following man&#xD;

(jewel,). you are now in the presence of persons of&#xD;
great sagacity and honour; take heed you do not&#xD;
deceive the expectations they have conceived of you&#xD;
from the world's report: you have got laurels; be-&#xD;
ware their withering. In. a word, deport yourself&#xD;
like the bijou (the jewel) of canary birds; as you&#xD;
certainly are."&#xD;
All this time the bird seemed to listen, and, indeed,&#xD;
placed himself in the true attitude of attention, by&#xD;
sloping his head to the ear of the man, and then dis.-&#xD;
tinctly nodding twice when his master left off speak-&#xD;
ing; and if ever nods were intelligible and promis-.&#xD;
sory, these were two of them.&#xD;
" That's good," says the master, pulling off his&#xD;
hat to the bird. " Now let us see if you are a cana-&#xD;
ry of honour. 9ive us a tune." The. canary sung.&#xD;
"Pshaw ! -that's too harsh: it is the note of a raven&#xD;
with a hoarseness upon him: something pathetic."&#xD;
The canary whistled as if its little throat w as chang&#xD;
ed to a lute. " Faster," says the man-" slower-&#xD;
very well-but what a plague is this foot about, and&#xD;
this little head ? No wonder you are out, Mr. Bijou,&#xD;
when you forget your time. That's a jewel! Bravo,&#xD;
bravo, my little man !"&#xD;
All that he was ordered or reminded of, did he&#xD;
do to admiration. His head and foot beat time-&#xD;
humoured the variations, both of tone and move-&#xD;
ment; and " the sound was a just echo to the sense,"&#xD;
according to the strictest laws of poetical and, (as it&#xD;
ought to be) of musical composition-Bravo! bravo!&#xD;
re--echoed from all parts of the 6ining-room.-The&#xD;
musicians swore the canary was a greater master of&#xD;
music than any of their band. " And do you not&#xD;
show your sense of this civility, Sir?" cries the bird-&#xD;
catcher, with an angry air. The canary bowed&#xD;
most respectfully, to the great delight of the compa-.&#xD;
ny. His next achievement was going through mar.-&#xD;
tial exercise with a straw gun; after which, " My&#xD;
poor bijou," says his owner, " thou hast had. hard&#xD;
&#xD;
'THE CAN(ARY BIRD.&#xD;
work, and must be a little weary a few perform-&#xD;
ances more, and thou shalt repose. Show the ladies&#xD;
how to make a curtesy."&#xD;
The bird here crossed his taper legs, and sunk&#xD;
and rose with an ease arnd grace that would have&#xD;
put half our subscription assembly belles to the&#xD;
blush. " That's my fine bird-and now a bow, head&#xD;
and foot corresponding." Here the striphings, for&#xD;
ten miles round London, might have blushed also.&#xD;
" Let us finish with a hornipipe, my brave little fel-&#xD;
low !-That's it-keep it up, keep it up!"&#xD;
The activity, 'glee, spirit, and accuracy, with&#xD;
which this last order was obeyed, wound up the ap-&#xD;
plause, (in which all the musicians joined, as well&#xD;
with their instruments as their clappings,) to the&#xD;
highest pitch of admiration. Bijou, himself, seemed&#xD;
to feel the sacred thirst of fame,; and shook his little&#xD;
plumes, and carolled an Io pwan that sounded like&#xD;
the conscious notes of victory.&#xD;
," Thou hast done all my biddings bravely," said&#xD;
the master, caressing his feathered servant; "now,&#xD;
then, take a nap, while I take thy place." Here-&#xD;
upon the canary went into a counterfeit slumber, so&#xD;
like the effect of the poppied god, first shutting one&#xD;
eye, then the other, then nodding,; then dropping so&#xD;
much on one side, that the hands of several of there&#xD;
~--jcompany were stretched out to save him from falling,&#xD;
and, just as those hands approached his feathers,&#xD;
suddenly recovering and dropping as much on the&#xD;
other. At length the sleep fixed him in a steady&#xD;
posture; whereupon the man took him from his fin-&#xD;
ger, and laid him flat upon the table, where, the man&#xD;
-assured us he would remain in a good soundly sleep,&#xD;
while he himself had the lionour to fill up the inter-&#xD;
val. Accordingly, after drinking a glass of wine,&#xD;
in the progress of taking off which, he was inter-&#xD;
rupted by the cafiary bird springing suddenly up to&#xD;
-assert his right to a share; really putting his little&#xD;
bill into'the glass, and then laying himself down to&#xD;
ileep again, the owner called him a saucy fellow, and&#xD;

w~ith a tobacco pipe, while he smoked with another;&#xD;
and several of the positions were so difficult to be&#xD;

had been no doubt on the watch, from some unob&#xD;

poor canary in its mouth, and rushed out of the&#xD;

in sm~ch dismay, accompanie(l by such looks and Ian..&#xD;

He spread him half-leng.th over the table, and&#xD;
mourned his canary bird with most undissembled&#xD;
sorrow. " W~ell may I grieve for thee, poor little&#xD;
thing! well may I grieve. 'More than four years&#xD;

slept in my bosom. I owe to t-l~e my support, my&#xD;

just punishment for my vanity. Had I relied only on&#xD;
thy happy powers, all had been well, and thou hadst&#xD;
been perched on my finger, or lulled in my breast at&#xD;
this moment; but, trusting to my own talents, a m~ d&#xD;

TTI~ CANARY BIRD.&#xD;
of the forlorn bird-catcher, whose despairing motion&#xD;
an(l frantic air no words can paint. He took from&#xD;
his pocket a little green bag of faded velvet, and,&#xD;
drawing from out it some wo4l and cotton, that we're&#xD;
the wrappings of whistles, bird-calls, and other in-&#xD;
struments of his trade, all of which he threw on the&#xD;
table, as in scorn, and making a couch, placed the&#xD;
mutilated limbs, and ravaged feathers of ch~5 canary&#xD;
upon it, and renewed his lamentations.&#xD;
The bird-catcher's lamentations were now much&#xD;
softened, as is ever the case, when the rage of grief&#xD;
yields to its tenderness, when it is too much over&#xD;
power by the effect to advert to the cause. It is&#xD;
needless to observe, that everyone of the company&#xD;
sympathized with him, but none more than the band&#xD;
of musicians, who, being engaged in a profession&#xD;
that naturally keeps the sensibilities more or less in&#xD;
exercise, felt the ~distress of the poor bird-man with&#xD;
peculiar force. it was really a banquet to see these&#xD;
I)eople gathering themselves into a knot, and, after&#xD;
whispering, wiping their eyes, and blowing their&#xD;
noses, depute ~ne from amongst them to be the medi-'&#xD;
urn of conveying into the pocket of' the bird-maw&#xD;
the very contribution they had~ just before received~&#xD;
for their own efforts. The poor fe11~w, perceiving&#xD;
them, took from the pocket the little parcel they&#xD;
had rolled up, andbrought out with it, by an un~&#xD;
lucky accident, another little bag, at the sight of&#xD;
which he was extremely agitated;' for it contained&#xD;
the canary seed, the food of the ' (lear lost compan-&#xD;
ion of his art." There is no giving language to the&#xD;
effect of this trifling circumstance upon the poor fel-&#xD;
low; he threw down the contribution money, that&#xD;
he brought from his pocket along with it, not with&#xD;
an ungrateful, but with a desperate hand. He&#xD;
opened the bag, which was fastened with red tape,&#xD;
and, taking out some of the seed, put it to the very&#xD;
bill of the lifeless bird, exclaiming-' No, poor bijoul&#xD;

TUB CAYARY BIRD.&#xD;

eanst remember how happy we both were, when I&#xD;
bought this bag full for thee. Had it been filled&#xD;
with gold, tl)ou hadst (leserved it."-." It shall be&#xD;
filled,-..-and with gold," said the master~f the house,&#xD;
if I COUI(l aflord it."&#xD;
The good inan rose from his seat, which had long&#xD;
been uneasy to him, and, gently taking the bag, put&#xD;
into it some silver; saying, as he handed it to his&#xD;
nearest neighbour, " who will refuse to follow my&#xD;
example? It is not a subscription for mere charity;&#xD;
it is a tribute to one of the rarest things in the whole&#xD;
world; namely, to real feeling, in this sophistical,&#xD;
pretending, parading age. If ever the passion of&#xD;
love and gratitude was in the heart of man, it is in&#xD;
the heart of that happy fellow; and whether the&#xD;
object that calls out such feelings, be bird, beast,&#xD;
fish, or man, it is alike.-Virtue and ""ought&#xD;
to be rewarded," said his next neighbour, putting in-&#xD;
to the bag his quota.&#xD;
it is superfluous to say, that, after th~ seed had&#xD;
been taken wholly away, and put very delicately out&#xD;
of the poor man's sight, every body most cheerfully&#xD;
contributed to make up a purse, to repair, as much&#xD;
as money could, the bird-man's loss. The last per-&#xD;
son applied to, was a very beautiful German young&#xD;
lady, wh , a she placed her bounty in the hag,&#xD;
closed it mined tely after, and blushed. As there&#xD;
are all sorts of blushes, (at least one to every action&#xD;
of our lives, tha{ is worth any characteristic feeling,&#xD;
supposing the actor can feel at all,) suspicion would&#xD;
have thought this young lady, who was so anxious&#xD;
to conceal her gift, gave little or nothing; but caii-&#xD;
dour, who'reasons in a different manner, would sup.&#xD;
pose, what was really the case, that it was a blush,&#xD;
not of avarice and Jeceptioa, but of benevolence&#xD;
graced with modesty. Curiosity, however, caught&#xD;
the bag, opened it, and turned out its contents,&#xD;
amongst which was a golden ducat, that, by its (late&#xD;
and brightness, had been hoarded. "Ah, ha," said&#xD;
curiosity, "who does this belong to, I wonder?"&#xD;
258&#xD;
&#xD;
Guilt and innocence, avarice an(J benignity, arc&#xD;
alike honest in one point; since they all, in the mo-&#xD;
ment of attack, by some means or another, discover&#xD;
what they wish to conceal. There was not, in the&#xD;
fhen large company, a single person who cpul(l not&#xD;
have exclaimed to this young lady, with assurance&#xD;
of the truth-T/sou art the woman! There was no&#xD;
deP~y4ng the fact; it was written on every feature of&#xD;
her enchanting face. She struggled, however, with&#xD;
the accusation almost to tears, but they were such&#xD;
tears as would have given lustre to the finest eyes in&#xD;
the world; for they gave lustre to hers, and would&#xD;
have ~idded effulgence to a ray of the sun.&#xD;
"Well,1then, if nobody else will own this neglect-&#xD;
ed ducat," cried the master of the house, who was&#xD;
uncle to the lady abovementioned, " I will."&#xD;
'Whereupon he took it from the heap, and exchanged&#xD;
it for two others, which enriched the collection.&#xD;
~While the business of the heart was thus carry-&#xD;
ing on, the poor bird-man, who was the occasion&#xD;
an(I object of it, was, at first, divided by contrary&#xD;
emotions of pain and pleasure; his eye sometimes&#xD;
directed to the massacred canary, and sometimes to&#xD;
the company. At~ length, generosity proved the&#xD;
stronger emotion, and grief ebbed away. He had'&#xD;
lost a bird, but he had gained the good-will of many&#xD;
human beings. That bird, it is true, was his pride&#xD;
and supl)ort, but this was not the crisis any longer&#xD;
to bewail its fate. He accepted the contribution&#xD;
purse, by one means or another, filled like the sack&#xD;
of Benjamin, even to the brim, and bowed, but spoke&#xD;
not; then, folding up the corpse of the canary in its&#xD;
wool and cotton shroud, departed with one of those&#xD;
looks, that, the moment it is seen, is felt and under-&#xD;
stood, but for which, being too powerful for descrip-&#xD;
tion, no language has yet been provided. On going&#xD;
out he beckoned the musicians to IbIlow. They did&#xD;
so, striking a few chords, that would have graced&#xD;
the funeral of Juliet. My very soul pursued the&#xD;
sounds, anli so did my feet. I hastened to the outet&#xD;

turning the money, which the founder of the bene.&#xD;
violence (for such were the musicians) had sub-&#xD;
scr'ibed.&#xD;
I have nothing to add to this gleaning, but a piece&#xD;
of information that belongs to it. The very next&#xD;
morning 1 was witness to two traits of the heart, of&#xD;
the master of the mansion, where these transactions&#xD;
had passed. A nobler minded man lived not: alas!&#xD;
he is no more. On my coming down to breakfast,&#xD;
the day after, I saw the footman departing with the&#xD;
cat who killed the bird; "Not," said the gentle..&#xD;
man, "to put her to death, for an act that was natural&#xD;
to her, but to put her where I know she will be out&#xD;
of my sight; for I never could look at her again,&#xD;
without being reminded of the most uncomfortable&#xD;
l)art of yesterday's adventure. Poor bijou! I have&#xD;
not a doubt but~all we have done atones but scantily&#xD;
for the loss of such a friend." Just as he said this,&#xD;
the niece, whose person and mind I have already&#xD;
particularized, came into the breakfast room: "And&#xD;
now," said the old gentleman, "to finish this busi&#xD;
ness; look ye, Henrietta, I gave you this new ducat&#xD;
to lay out ~t the fair, in any manner von liked best;&#xD;
and though I think the way in whi&amp;amp;h you disposed&#xD;
of it, the very best you could have chosen, (nay, no&#xD;
more blushing,) I think it never ought to go out of&#xD;
our family; for do you know that I have taken it in~&#xD;
to my old superstitious head, that t~ie blessiiw of the&#xD;
Giver of all good will stay with us, while such a&#xD;
ducat remains amongst us; I therefore bought it&#xD;
back cheaply with two others. Age is superstitou~,&#xD;
iou know, my dear. Indulge me then, love, and&#xD;
take care of it while I live, after which it shall be&#xD;
yours; and, in the mean time, that you may not lose&#xD;
your fairing, in this little purse are ten others, that,&#xD;
though not so distinguished by whatto my old heart,&#xD;
is more precious than the gold of Ophir, may serve&#xD;
well enough the common purposes of life."&#xD;
Much of this was spoken with tender difficulty&#xD;
~tio&#xD;

&#xD;
and the gift was received with more: but she loved&#xD;
the hand which, in the first instance, had enabled&#xD;
her to be generous, too well not to reward it. Was&#xD;
not this, indeed, an illustration of the virtue of the&#xD;
Man of Ross, who&#xD;
"Did good, yet blusls'd to find it fame !"&#xD;
To apologize to you for this story, as I have said&#xD;

&#xD;
Tiiz first scene was that of the crucifixion of the&#xD;
So~ur Rachel, and the Sa~iir Felicite, two women,&#xD;
from thirty to forty years of age, who were inwardly&#xD;
moved, as they pretended, to exhibit this lively&#xD;
image of the passion of our Saviour, in a mean lodg-&#xD;
ing at Paris, in August, 1759. These two wretched&#xD;
creatures, were actually nailed to two wooden cross~&#xD;
es, through their hands and their feet, and continu-&#xD;
ed fastened to them for upwards of three hours; dur-&#xD;
ing which they sometimes pretended to slumber in a&#xD;
beatific trance, and, at other times, uttered a quan-&#xD;
tity of infantile nonsense and gibberish, asking for&#xD;
sweetmeats, and threatening~and fondling the spec-&#xD;
tators, in lisping accents, and all the babyish diminu-&#xD;
Lives of the nursery. The nails were at length&#xD;
drawn out, and a considerable quantity of blood&#xD;
flowed from all the wounds; after w~hing and&#xD;
bandaging which, the patients sat down quietly to a&#xD;
little repast in the midst of the apartment. Al-&#xD;
though their votaries ~nd ghostly advisers main-&#xD;
tained that they experienced no pain, but, on the&#xD;
contrary, the most exquisite delight, from thQse ope-&#xD;
rations, the respectable reporters concur in testify-&#xD;

ing, that it was easy to see throughout, that they&#xD;
were frequently in the utmost agony; and that, in&#xD;
driving in and drawing out the nails, in particular,&#xD;
~they could not refrain from all the contortions and&#xD;
writhing of the most dreadful sufferirig;-~-though&#xD;
they had the incredible fortitude and self-command&#xD;
to suppress any audible- indications of their misery,&#xD;
and not to utter the least murmur or groan in the&#xD;
midst of their torments. After this tragedy, there&#xD;
was a kind of afterpiece, by the inferior perform-&#xD;
ers and pupils of this school of imposture.-Va-&#xD;
rious women were stretched on the floor, and&#xD;
beat with bludgeons on the head and breast, and&#xD;
trodden violently under the feet of their spiritual as-&#xD;
sistants, to their infinite relief 'and gratification, as&#xD;
the managers of the spectacle most solemnly assert-&#xD;
ed-but with more or less apparent dread and suf-&#xD;
fering, according to M. Grimm's informers, as they&#xD;
had made a less ora greater progress in this strange&#xD;
and barbarous imposture. They had also the points&#xD;
of swords pressed forcibly agai1pst their sides and ho-&#xD;
soms;-and were not only miraculously protected&#xD;
from wounds, but received the greatest consolation&#xD;
from the most serious and continued thrusting.&#xD;
This, it seems, illustrated in a wonderful manner,&#xD;
the invulnerability of the church, under all the per-&#xD;
secutions of unholy power!-and their insensibility&#xD;
to blows and kicking, typified, in the same pitiful&#xD;
jargon, the insensibility of the worldly-minded, to all&#xD;
the solicitations and impulses of divine grace.&#xD;
The second exhibition, the particulars of which&#xD;
Ni. de Condamine wrote down while it was going on,&#xD;
consisted in the crucifixion of the Socur Francoise&#xD;
and the Sceur Marie, and a great deal of beating and&#xD;
thrusting with swords, on the bodies of some of their&#xD;
unfortunate apprentices. M. de Condamine hand-&#xD;
led and examined the nails"as they were driven in&#xD;
and taken out. They were rough and square, up-&#xD;
wards of three inches in length, and entered the&#xD;
wood of the cross- nearly half an inch; but little&#xD;

blood flowed on driving them in, but a good deal on&#xD;
their extraction. Franchise remained upwards of&#xD;
three hours on the cross; which was shifted into a&#xD;
great variety of posturesduring this period. But&#xD;
the So2ur Marie wanted faith or fortitude to edify&#xD;
the beholders to the same extent-she shuddered at&#xD;
the fastening of the nails, and in less than an hour&#xD;
fairly cried out that she could stand it no longer.&#xD;
and must be taken down :-she was unfastened ac-&#xD;
cordingly, and carried out of the chamber in a state&#xD;
of insensibility, t q'~ the no small discomfiture of her&#xD;
associates. The kp ectacle was concluded with a&#xD;
still more unlucky~rformance. The Sceur Fran-&#xD;
cois had announced that God had commanded her,&#xD;
on that day, to burn the gown off her back, and had&#xD;
assured her much comfort from the operation. After&#xD;
a great deal of grimacing accordingly, fire was ac-&#xD;
tually set to her skirts-but, instead of appearing to&#xD;
experience any delight, the failing saint very speedi..&#xD;
ly screamed out in terror; and they were obliged&#xD;
to pour water upon her petticoats, and carry her off&#xD;
half roasted-half drowned-and utterly ashamed of&#xD;
her exhibition. 'rhose horrible and degrading&#xD;
practices had been going on in the heart of Paris for&#xD;
upwards of twenty years. A few profligate priests&#xD;
were supposed to be at the bottom of the contri-&#xD;
vance: but all the agents, or victims rather, were&#xD;
women; and such appears to have been their heroic&#xD;
constancy, and willing devotedness, that it is diffi-&#xD;
cult not to suppose that there was a mixture, at&#xD;
least, of real enthusiasm with their knavery, and a&#xD;
combination, not quite unintelligible, of an actual&#xD;
illusion, with a design to impose upon others. Short-&#xD;
ly after this visit of M. de Condamine, the exhibi-&#xD;
tion was' put down by the police.&#xD;

DE SCRIPTION OF HE LL.&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
IN Charles the Second's days it was the custom,&#xD;
when a gentleman drank a lady's health, as a toast,&#xD;
by way of doing her honour, to throw some part of&#xD;
his dress into the fire, an example which his com-&#xD;
panions were bound to ,follow, by consuming the&#xD;
same article of their apparel, whatever it might be.&#xD;
One of his friends perceiving, at a tavern dinner,&#xD;
that Sir Charles Se dl ey had on a very rich lace cra&#xD;
vat, when he named his toast committed his crava.&#xD;
to the flames, and Sir Charles and the rest were&#xD;
obliged to (10 the same. The poet bore his loss with&#xD;
great composure, observing it was a good joke, but&#xD;
that he would have as good a one some other time.&#xD;
He therefore watched his opportunity, when the&#xD;
same p arty was assembled on a subsequent occasion,&#xD;
and drinking off a bumper to the health of Nell&#xD;
Gwynne, he called the waiter, and ordering a tooth&#xD;
drawer into the room, whom he had previously&#xD;
brought" to the tavern for the purpose, made him&#xD;
draw a decayed tooth, which had long plagued him.&#xD;
Trhe rules of' good fellowship, then in force, clearly&#xD;
required that every one of the company should have&#xD;
a tooth drawn also, but they naturally expressed a&#xD;
hope that Sedley would not be so unmerciful as to&#xD;
enforce the law. Deaf, hoivever, to all their re-&#xD;
monstrances, persuasions, and- entreaties, he saw&#xD;
them, one after another, in the hands of the operator,&#xD;
and writhing with pain, while lie exclaimed, " pa--&#xD;
tience, gentlemen, patience; youi know you promis-&#xD;
ed that I should have my frolic too."&#xD;

THE&#xD;
&#xD;
The following extract is from a tract written by&#xD;
F. Pinamonti, a Jesuit, entitled felll opened to&#xD;
Christians, or Considerations on the Inftrnal pains&#xD;
for every day in the week.&#xD;
GOD has framed a prison- in the lowest region of&#xD;
the universe, a very suitable place, as the furtherest&#xD;
4f all from heaven. Here, though the place itself is&#xD;
wide enou-gh, the damned will not even have that&#xD;
-relief, which either a poor prisoner has in walking&#xD;
between four walls, or the sick man in turning him-&#xD;
self in bed, because here they shall be bound up like&#xD;
a faggot, and heaped one upon another like unfor-&#xD;
tunate victims; and this by reason of the great num-&#xD;
ber of the damned, to whom this great pit will be-&#xD;
come narrow andl strait; as also because the fire it-&#xD;
self will be to them, like chains and fetters. Those&#xD;
miserable wret'ches will not only be straitened, but&#xD;
also be immovable; and so weak, as not to be able&#xD;
even to remove from the eye, a worm that is gnaw-&#xD;
ing it. T he walls of this prison are more than four&#xD;
thousand miles thick, that is, as far as from hence to&#xD;
hell; but were they as thin as paper, the prisoners&#xD;
will be too weak to break through them to make&#xD;
their escape.&#xD;
This prison will not only be extremely strait, but&#xD;
also extremely dark. It is true there will be fire,&#xD;
but deprived of light. This fire, burning with brim-~&#xD;
stone, will have a searching flame, which being min-&#xD;
.gled with the rolling smoke of that infernal cave,&#xD;
will fill the whole place, and raise a storm of dark-&#xD;

without number, but intense without comparison,&#xD;
and pure without mixture. How little do the law..&#xD;
givers among us find out what pain is. The divine&#xD;
justice has discovered a place full of executioners&#xD;
and condemned persons, filled with hatred and re-&#xD;
proaches, in the middle of a sea of fire, which has&#xD;
~ieit her shore nor bottom. ~i'he pains there will lend&#xD;
each other a fresh sting, and the damned will be like&#xD;
so many vessels as full as they can be of the anger&#xD;
of God. There will be nothing wanting of all that&#xD;
can render a soul most unhappy; that the misery of&#xD;
the wicked may be on all sides complete. The fire,&#xD;
alone, would have 'been sufficient to render 'them&#xD;
most unfortunate; for in that alone the damned would&#xD;
have had incomparably more grief, than from all the&#xD;
butcheries which men or the devils could have in..&#xD;
vented, that being the invention of God himself: and&#xD;
yet, their wickedness deserves still more. The damn-&#xD;
ed soul will behold above her, heaven shut; under&#xD;
her, nothing but unquenchable flames; roupd her,&#xD;
devils not to be bore with; and within herself such&#xD;
pains as can have no relief! The sensitive appetite&#xD;
will, like the ebbing and flowing of the sea, be con-&#xD;
tinually swelling and flowing, or rather always sink-&#xD;
ing into agonies, into rage and anguish, exposed to&#xD;
all the blows of divine justice, without ever being&#xD;
able to avoid any one of them. "A short disease,"&#xD;
says Seneca, "must either kill, or be killed;" but in&#xD;
Hell the rules are quite the contrary, for the pains&#xD;
will always continue in the same state; intolera-&#xD;
ble as to intenseness, and endless a~ to duration;&#xD;
neither making the pains lighter by time, or consum-&#xD;
ing the sufferers. As there is nothing moderate in&#xD;
the torments, so there is no rest in the tormented,&#xD;
who are continually kept, not barely alive, but in&#xD;
their full senses, to have greater feeling of their&#xD;
misery, from which they cannot so much as for one.&#xD;
moment depart God for that end having gathered&#xD;
together all manner of pains as it were in one bun-&#xD;
dle, to load them on the shoulders of those !lnfortu&#xD;

DESCRIPTION OF ELL.&#xD;
nate rebels, he will empty the a ~senal of his justice,&#xD;
of all his debts, to strike them o r~ all sides, that there&#xD;
may be no l)lace in them without its wound.~ If the&#xD;
pains of one only of those unfortunate souls were di-&#xD;
vided among all mankind here on earth, what would&#xD;
come to every one's share, would kill them with more&#xD;
torment than any criminal has ever sufThred. Were&#xD;
the pains of Hell less racking, yet, being never to&#xD;
have an end, they would become infinite. What&#xD;
then will it be, they being both intolerable as to&#xD;
sharpness, and endless as to duration: a torment,&#xD;
which is to last inPnite hours, infinite days,.infinite&#xD;
ages! That pain certainly must be infinite, and sur-&#xD;
pass all our thoughts to conceive it: for were it pro-&#xD;
posed to the damned, to suffer either the sting of a&#xD;
bee in their eye for a whole eternity, or to undergo&#xD;
all the torments of Hell for as many ages as there are&#xD;
stars in Heaven, they would, without doubt, choose&#xD;
rather to be thus miserable for so many ages, and&#xD;
then to see an end of their misery, than to endure a&#xD;
pain so much less, that was to have no end. These&#xD;
unfortunate creatures will not only be tormented fot&#xD;
eternity, I)ut will have eternity itself to torment&#xD;
them, because it being always in their sight, it will&#xD;
every' moment oppress them with all its weight. a~&#xD;
an immense sphere of brass would op~ire~ s, with&#xD;
all its weight, the plain it lies on, though it actual~&#xD;
touched it but in one point. Besides, a~ the fear of&#xD;
a punishment to come, afflicts sometimes more&#xD;
the punishment itself: eternity not only every mo-&#xD;
ment torments the damned, but to the damned every&#xD;
moment is turned into many eternities.&#xD;
To complete the despair of the damned, they will&#xD;
consider the' glory of the saints in Heaven. This&#xD;
sight, by a cruel opposition will quicken the torments&#xD;
of these poor wretches: they will know that God and&#xD;
his saints rejoice at their pains, on account of the&#xD;
glory which redounds to the divine justice in the&#xD;
condemnation of sinners. 0 what a wound must&#xD;
this make in the heart of those miserable creatures&#xD;

To be obliged to suffer so many torments for ever,&#xD;
and in the presence of their Judge, and of their&#xD;
greatest enemies, the saints; to be forced to suffer&#xD;
this to the increase of their felicity, as a victim of a&#xD;
perpetual sacrifice, consumed, without being destroy-&#xD;
ed, in the honor of the Most High. And yet so as&#xD;
it is: if~I, unfortunately, should be damned, and thou,&#xD;
0 Reader, should be saved, thou wilt for ever re-&#xD;
joice at my torments, and I always repine at thy&#xD;
joy: and on the contrary, if I should be saved, and&#xD;
thou~ lost, I shall laugh at thy destruction, not as it is&#xD;
an evil to thee, but because it is a good to God, re-&#xD;
ye nging the outrages committed against him. The&#xD;
infernal fire will have its rise from the foot of the&#xD;
throne of God. It will receive an incredible vigor&#xD;
from the omnipotence of God; working, not with its&#xD;
own activity, but, as an instrument, with the activi-&#xD;
ty of its agent; who will give to the flames such in-&#xD;
tenseness as he shall think convenient to revenge&#xD;
the outrages committed against him, and repair the&#xD;
injuries done his glory. Every one that is damned,&#xD;
will be like a lighted furnace, which has its own&#xD;
flames in itself; all that filthy blood will boil in the&#xD;
veins, the brains in the skull, the heart in the breast,&#xD;
tbe bowels within that unfortunate body, surrounded&#xD;
with an abyss of fire, out of which it cannot escape.&#xD;
It is what the divine Majesty, injured by sinners~&#xD;
requires; it is what the blood of Christ demands.&#xD;

Sv. CATHARINE, who often saw the devil, also saw,&#xD;
~t six years old, upon the top of a church, a rich&#xD;
throne, with Christ sitting on it, in the pontifical&#xD;
habit of the pope, with a triple crown on his head,&#xD;
accompanied by St. Peter, St. Paul, and John the&#xD;
Evangelist. She knew the lives of the holy fathers&#xD;
an~l hermits by revelation, practiced abstinence, and&#xD;
shut herself up with other children in a room, where&#xD;
they whi1)ped themselves. At seven years 01(1 she&#xD;
dedicated her virginity to God by a vow, and offered&#xD;
herself to the Virgin as a spouse for her Son. When&#xD;
marriageable, she refused the importunity of her&#xD;
parents to wed; and having cut off her hair to keep&#xD;
her vow, they made her a kitchenmaid: but her&#xD;
father, one day as he was praying in a corner, see-&#xD;
ng the Holy ~ifliost sitting upon her head in the&#xD;
shape of a dove, she was released from drudgery, and&#xD;
was favoured with a revelation from St. Dominick.&#xD;
She eat no meat, drank only water, and at last left&#xD;
off bread, sustaining herself by herbs alone, and her&#xD;
grace before meals was, let us go take the punish-&#xD;
v~tent dz'~e to this miserable sinner. She so mastered&#xD;
sleep, that she scarcely took any rest, and her bed&#xD;
was only boards. She wore around her body next&#xD;
to the skin a chain of iron, which ate into her flesh.&#xD;
Three times a day, and for an hour and a half each&#xD;
time, she flogged herself with another iron chain, till&#xD;
great streams of blood ran down, and when she took&#xD;
the black and white habit of the order of St. Dordi-&#xD;
nick she increased her mortification. For three&#xD;
year~ she never spoke, except at confession; never&#xD;
stirred out of her cell but to go to the church; and&#xD;
sat up all night watching-taking rest in the quire&#xD;
at nations only, and then laying upon tne floor with&#xD;
a piece of wood under her head for a bolster. She&#xD;
was tempted by devils in a strange manner describe&#xD;

ed by Ribadeneira; but to drive them away, she&#xD;
disciplined her body with the iron chain so much the&#xD;
more. When the fiend perceived he could make no&#xD;
impression on her virginal heart, he changed his&#xD;
battery. She had undertaken to cure an old woman&#xD;
who had a cancer in her breast so loathsome, that no&#xD;
one would go near her, but by'the devil's instigation,&#xD;
the old woman gave out that Catharine was not as&#xD;
good as she should be, and stuck to her point. Catha..&#xD;
rine, knowing the devil's tricks, would not desist;&#xD;
and, to do her honor, Christ appeared, and offered&#xD;
to her the choice of two crowns-one of pure gold,&#xD;
the other of thorns; she took the crown of thorns,&#xD;
pressed it so close upon her bead, that it gave her&#xD;
great pain; and Christ commanded her to continue&#xD;
her attendance upon he woman who, in consc~&#xD;
quence of a vision, confessed her calumny, to the&#xD;
great confusion of the devil. Once, as she was&#xD;
dressing the old woman's breast, the operation turn..&#xD;
ed her stomach: this was a temptation of the devil&#xD;
to divert her from her good work; but she defeated&#xD;
him, and the manner shall be stated in Ribadeneira's&#xD;
words: "she applied her mouth and nose to the wo-&#xD;
man's rotten and cankered sore, and so continued&#xD;
till she found the flesh had submitted to the spirit."&#xD;
Ribadeneria, then says, that at "another time she&#xD;
did a thing worthy of greater admiration; for, as she&#xD;
had opened the same sore, the stench of it quite over-&#xD;
came her stomach; and yet she washed it, and made&#xD;
it clean;, and gathering the putrified matter into a&#xD;
dish, with great fervor of faith, she drank it up; and&#xD;
presently upon this the temptation ceased; ~nd she&#xD;
told Father Raymundus, her ghostly father, that in&#xD;
all the days of her life she had never drunken any&#xD;
thing so sweet and savoryy" Though it appears&#xD;
from this story, that Catharine was sufficiently re-&#xD;
warded by the savoriness of th~ meal, yet, Ribade..&#xD;
neira says, that, the night following, Christ appear-&#xD;
ed, opened to her ~he wound in his side, ~nd made&#xD;
her drink till she was so ravisbed, that her soul wa~&#xD;
&#xD;
deprived of its functions. Her love and affection tG&#xD;
Christ was so intense, that she was almost always&#xD;
languishing and sick; at last it took away her life,&#xD;
and she was dead for four hours, in which time she&#xD;
saw strange things concerning heaven, hell, and&#xD;
purgatory. On a certain day be appeared to her,&#xD;
with his mother and other saints, and espoused her&#xD;
in a marvellous and singular manner; visited he~&#xD;
almost continually with the g e est familiarity~ and&#xD;
affection, sometimes in their c m , though ord~-&#xD;
narily he came alone, and ente t med her by reciting&#xD;
and singing psalms with her. nce as she was com-&#xD;
ing home from church, he appeared to her in the&#xD;
disguise of a pilgrim, and begged a coat of her; she&#xD;
returned to the church, and secretly taking off her&#xD;
petticoat, brought it to him, not knowing wno he&#xD;
was. He asked her for a shirt; she bade him follow&#xD;
her home, and she gave him her shift. Not content&#xD;
with this, he requested more clothes of her, as well&#xD;
for himself as a companion; hut a~ she had, nothing&#xD;
else left, and was much afflicted, in the night, Christ&#xD;
appeared to her as a pilgrim, and showing her what&#xD;
she had bestowed upon him in the garb he had as-&#xD;
sumed, promised to give her an invisible garjnent,&#xD;
which should keep her from all cold both ol body&#xD;
and soul. One time she prayed to him to take from&#xD;
her her heart of flesh, and it seemed to her that Christ&#xD;
came, and opening her side, took out her heart, and&#xD;
carried it away with him. This appeared almost&#xD;
incredible to her confessor when ~he told him she&#xD;
had no heart; yet," says Ribadeneira, "that which&#xD;
happened afterwards was a certain argument of the&#xD;
truth; for, in a few days, Christ appeared to her in&#xD;
great brightness, holding in his hand a ruddy heart,&#xD;
most beautiful to 1)ehold, and coming to her, put it&#xD;
into her left side, and said, My daughter Catharine,&#xD;
now thou hast my heart instead of thy own; and hay-&#xD;

forgiveness for numbers that were ready to fall into&#xD;
hell. Two hardened im~enitent thieves, who were led&#xD;
to execution, tied and tortured on a cart, and attend-&#xD;
ed by a multitude of devils, Catharine begged the&#xD;
favor of'going with them in the tart to the city gates,&#xD;
and there by her prayers and intercession, Christ&#xD;
showed himself to the 1~hieves, all bloody ~and full of&#xD;
wounds, invited them to penance, and promised&#xD;
them pardon if they would repent, which they ac-&#xD;
cordingly did. Through her intercession, her moth-&#xD;
er, who died without confession, was raised to life&#xD;
again, and lived till she was fourscore and nine years&#xD;
old. She had the gift of prophecy, healed the sick&#xD;
at the last gasp, cast out devils, atid worked mira-&#xD;
des. Once making bread of tainted flour, the queen&#xD;
of angels came to help'her to knead it, and it proved&#xD;
to be most excellent bread, white and savory. She&#xD;
drew also very good wine out of an empty hogshead;&#xD;
but her numerous victories over the devil were not less&#xD;
remarkable; they enraged him so much, that he tor~&#xD;
melted her, till she was nothing but skin and bones.&#xD;
Sometimes he amused himself with throwing her in-&#xD;
to the fire, and the marks and prints of the wounds&#xD;
he gave her, appeared all over her body. At length,"&#xD;
says Ribadeneira, "when she was three and thirty&#xD;
years old, she entered into an agony, fought the devil&#xD;
valiantly, and triumphed over him at her death,&#xD;
which happened at Rome on the 29th of April, 1380,&#xD;
her ghost appearing to Father Raymundus, her con-&#xD;
fessor, at Genoa on the same day, and her body&#xD;
working so many miracles, that for the multitude of&#xD;
people resorting thither, it could not be buried for&#xD;
three days."&#xD;

THERE was no greater pest to the medical tribe,&#xD;
than old Cooke, the miser. Many are the anecdotes&#xD;
of the tricks this avaricious old man used to play&#xD;
to cheat medical men and save his money: such&#xD;
as putting on ragged clothes, and going as a pauper&#xD;
to Mr. Saunders and other gentlemen, to have gra-&#xD;
tuitous advice for his eyes-gdting a letter for the&#xD;
dispensary, and attending there as a decayed trades-&#xD;
man, for several weeks, until detected.&#xD;
Having a wound in his leg, he employed a Mr.&#xD;
Pigeon, that lived nearly opposite to him, in White-&#xD;
lion-street, Pentonville, to cure it. "How long do&#xD;
you think it will l~e before you can care it ~" "A&#xD;
month."-" And how much must I give you?"-.&#xD;
Pigeon, who saw the wound was not of any great&#xD;
importance, answered, "A guinea."&#xD;
"Very well," replied Cooke;-" but mark this-&#xD;
a guinea is an immense sum of money, and wher~ I&#xD;
agree for sums of such magnitude, I go upon the sys-&#xD;
tem of no cure, no pay; so, if I am not cured by the&#xD;
expiration of the month, Ipay you nothing." rrl1i~&#xD;
was agreed to: after diligent attendance for several&#xD;
days, the wound was so near being healed, that&#xD;
Cooke expressed himself satisfied, and would not let&#xD;
Pigeon see it any more. However, within two or&#xD;
three days of the month being up, the old fellow got&#xD;
some sort of plaster with euphorbium in it, from a&#xD;
farrier, and made a new wound on the place, where&#xD;
the former had been, and, sending for Pigeon on the&#xD;
last day of the month, showed him that his leg was&#xD;
not well, and that, of course, the guinea he had&#xD;
agreed for was forfeited.-T his story the old fellow&#xD;
used to tell of himself with great satisfaction, and&#xD;
used to call it "plucking a Pigeon."&#xD;
When on his death-bed, he sent for several medi&#xD;

THE ENGLISH WATCH-MAKER.&#xD;
&#xD;
STORY OF AN ENGLISh WATCH-MAKER.&#xD;
So~IE years ago, a Protestant English watch.ma.&#xD;
I~er, who lived at Oporto in good credit and esteem,~&#xD;
had an accusationsecretly laid against him, of di-&#xD;
minishing the coin of the kingdom. A sudden search&#xD;
of his house was thereon immediately made, and a&#xD;
small piece of gold-coin, called a new-crown, being&#xD;
the tenth part of a moidore, and of the value of two&#xD;
shillings and eight-pence halfpenny, was found in a&#xD;
little quantity of aqua-regis; upon which, his person&#xD;
was seized, and soon after sent prisoner to Lisbon;&#xD;
where a legal process was commenced, for his con-&#xD;
viction, in the customary and slow manner of a&#xD;
Chancery-suit in England. During the course of&#xD;
these proceedings, the jesuits, who always gave their&#xD;
spiritual assistance to prisoners, undertook his con-&#xD;
version to their religion, which a~l Portuguese consid-&#xD;
er as the greatest act of piety and kindness, in being&#xD;
the means of saving a soul from perdition. It be-&#xD;
came natural for these people, of course, to get in-&#xD;
formation of the nature of his offence. He alleg-&#xD;
ed, in excuse of the fact he was charged with, that&#xD;
he was only making an experiment, and to which the&#xD;
insignificance of the piece of money, under opera-&#xD;
tion, gave so reasonable a colour, that the jesuits be-&#xD;
came willing to save him. They therefore publicly&#xD;
appeared zelous to effect his conversion, but private-&#xD;
ly dropt insinuations, that his safety depended on his&#xD;
not changing his religion, from the well-known scru-&#xD;
ples entertained in that country of sending a soul to&#xD;
hell, by dismissing it from a body out of the pale of&#xD;
what they so firmly believe to be the only true church,&#xD;
and which otherwise might have afterwards become&#xD;
saved b~ a conversion to their faith.&#xD;
This scruple has very often, in that country, been&#xD;
the me~s of retarding, for a long time, a condem-&#xD;

dinarily follows in three days: and that man's con.&#xD;
damnation would probably have taken place, had he&#xD;
suffered his religious faith to become perverted. The&#xD;
favourable opinion entertained ofhim, and his cause,&#xD;
by the jesui.ts who visited that prison, excited one&#xD;
father Carboiiii of their order, who was an Italian,&#xD;
and of high character for learning, knowledge, and&#xD;
worth, to pay him a visit; ~n which he took occasion&#xD;
to ask him, ff he could not perform some piece of&#xD;
curious workmanship in his art? His answer was,&#xD;
that he thought he could make a good watch of a&#xD;
size to be set in a ring. Thishe was bid to do, and&#xD;
at the sometime offered any money or materials that&#xD;
might be requisite for doing it. The piece of work&#xD;
was finished with all haste, and delivered to him.&#xD;
Father Carboni being in great esteem with his late&#xD;
Most Faithful Majesty, and often con sultd by him in&#xD;
affairs of the highest consequence, wore the ring up-&#xD;
on his finger the first time that he afterwards went&#xD;
to the palace; and while his majesty wasAiscour~sing&#xD;
with him, took care to give occasion to be observed&#xD;
to look often at his ring, till the king' asked him,&#xD;
what he had got upon his finger that he appeared to&#xD;
be so fond of. He answered, a trifling curiosity,&#xD;
and mentioned what it was. His majesty desired to&#xD;
look at it, which he did; and said it was a curiosity&#xD;
indeed. Carbon thereon said, he knew not how to&#xD;
consider it as worthy-~of his majesty's acceptance,&#xD;
unless rrom its having been made in his kingdom.&#xD;
The king, upon this, enquired who the mak~r of it&#xD;
was? He was answered with the giving of his name,&#xD;
and the mention of his unhappy situation, with eve-&#xD;
ry alleviating circumstance that could soften his ac-&#xD;
ion: upon hearing of which, his majesty, shak-&#xD;
ingh~ head, said, with a smile, "Aih! Father! you&#xD;
are a sly rogue; however, you may tell your friend,&#xD;
he shall be set at liberty," which was accordingly&#xD;
soon done.&#xD;

Some years since, the county of York were deeply&#xD;
interested in the trial of the father of a large fami-&#xD;
1y, who, when living in the greatest respectability,&#xD;
was accused of highway robbery. The trial was in&#xD;
York Castle; the prosecutor was a youth of about&#xD;
twenty years of age, the son of a banker, a~d the&#xD;
prisoner a stout athletic man of fifty. I'he prosecu-&#xD;
tor had transacted his business as usual at the mar-&#xD;
ket-town; he had received several sums of money in&#xD;
the presence of the prisoner; had dined, and about&#xD;
five o'clock had set out on his return home. It was&#xD;
a fine summer evening, and he rode gently on: in a&#xD;
solitary lane he was overtaken by the prisoner, who&#xD;
seized him and demanded his pocket-book: in the&#xD;
first agony of surprise and fear, the prosecutorstruclc&#xD;
him a violent blow with his wip; but the prisoner,&#xD;
who was a very powerful man, dragged him from his&#xD;
horse, knelt down upon him, and took from him his&#xD;
money and account books. In this situation, the&#xD;
1)rosecutor begged very earnestly for his life. As he&#xD;
laid under the prisoner, he watched his countenance,&#xD;
and saw that he was much agitated; the robber de-&#xD;
sisted, arose, mounted his horse, and rode away. It&#xD;
was then about seven o'clock in the evening; but the&#xD;
young man was so much exhausted, that he did not&#xD;
reach hom~ till late at night. He immediately stat-&#xD;
ed these circumstances; but the improbability of his&#xD;
having been robbed in open daylight,, on a public&#xD;
road, and of his having lost various memorandums,&#xD;
which a robber would scarcely have taken, excited&#xD;
some, suspicions respecting the truth of this state-&#xD;
ment.&#xD;
As the jury were leaving the box, the young man&#xD;
who had been robbed begged to be heard. He was&#xD;
so much agitated, that he could scarcely speak: when&#xD;
he recovered himself, he said. "I stand here to plead&#xD;

As smooth as glass, as white as curds,&#xD;
Her pretty hand invites;&#xD;
Sharp as a needle are her words;&#xD;
Her wit like pepper bites.&#xD;
Brisk as a body-louse she trips,&#xD;
Clean as a penny drest;&#xD;
Sweet as a rose her breath and lips,&#xD;
Round as' a globe her breast.&#xD;
Full as an egg, was I with glee,&#xD;
And happy as aking!        ..,&#xD;
Good Lord! how all men envy'd me, '&#xD;
She lov'd like any thing.&#xD;
But false as hefi, she, like the wind&#xD;
Chang'd, as her sex most do;&#xD;
S284&#xD;
&#xD;
NOBODY.&#xD;
&#xD;
Tho' seeming as the turtle kina,&#xD;
And like the gospel, true.&#xD;
If I and Molly could agree,&#xD;
Let who would take Peru;&#xD;
Great as an Emp'ror should I be,&#xD;
And richer than a Jew.&#xD;
Till you grow tender as a chick,&#xD;
SI'm dull as any post;&#xD;
Let us like burrs together stick,&#xD;
And warm as any toast.&#xD;
You'll find me truer than a die,&#xD;
And wish me better speed;&#xD;
Flat as a flounder when I lie,&#xD;
And, as a herring, dead.&#xD;
Sure as a gun she'll drop a tear,&#xD;
And sigh perhaps and wish,&#xD;
When I am rotten as a pear,&#xD;
And mute as any fish.&#xD;
&#xD;
NOBODY.&#xD;
&#xD;
SURE Nobody's a wicked devil,&#xD;
The author of consummate evil;&#xD;
In breaking dishes, basins, glasses,&#xD;
In stealing, hiding-he surpasses.&#xD;
Behold the punch-bowl crack'd around,&#xD;
For weeks the ladle was not found;&#xD;
How crack'd-'twas Nobody that did it,&#xD;
H w misplac'd-'twas Nobody hid it.&#xD;
W eyn in the school, sits Dr. Pedant,&#xD;
He alls to him that is the head in't,.&#xD;
" Wtio made that noise ? who let his tongue stir?"'-&#xD;
" Nobody, sir;" exclaim'd the youngster.&#xD;
The governess some mischief spies out;*&#xD;
285&#xD;
&#xD;
ff~&#xD;
&#xD;
Aye me! as thick as hops, or hail,&#xD;
The fine men crowd about her,&#xD;
But soon as dead as a door-nail,&#xD;
Shall I be, if without her. -&#xD;
Strait as my leg, her shape appears;&#xD;
Oh! were we join'd together! -&#xD;
My heart would he scot-free from cares,.&#xD;
And lighter than a feather.&#xD;

And, in a passion thus she cries out,-&#xD;
"Hey day! a pretty litter this is ?&#xD;
Whose doing, pray ? come, tell me, Misses~&#xD;
Whose doing ?" she repeats with fury,&#xD;
" Nobody's, Madam, I assure you "&#xD;
The lady of the house believes,-&#xD;
Ar guest her~servant maid receives.&#xD;
A thief, perhaps, who shams the lover,&#xD;
The windows' fastenings to discover;&#xD;
She hears a foot-yes, hears it plain,&#xD;
And calls, " Who's there ?"-but calls in vain:&#xD;
She lists--so anxious she to know,&#xD;
And hears a stranger's voice below;&#xD;
" Why, Jane, who is it you have got there ?"&#xD;
" Lord, Madam--Nobody, I swear,&#xD;
As every body can declare."&#xD;
" I'm sure somebody it must be,"&#xD;
" Nobody, Madam-cohke and see."&#xD;
She goes, but all in vain peeps,&#xD;
For any where Nobody creeps. -&#xD;
She finds her gravy soup diminished;&#xD;
Her ribs of beef are almost finished;&#xD;
" Hey day, who those provisions took,"&#xD;
" Nobody, Madam," rejoins the cook-.&#xD;
" Impossible! what do you mean ?"&#xD;
"hy, then the cat it must have been."&#xD;
Thus Nobodyjis never seen&#xD;
In Anybody's shape but that&#xD;
Of a domestic dog or cat.&#xD;
This Nobody, how strange, I think,&#xD;
Can walk and talk, can eat and drink;--&#xD;
But male or female ? why, I iveen&#xD;
The gender must be Epicene.&#xD;
An old offender, it appears,&#xD;
Who's liv'd above a thousand years;&#xD;
For Polyphemnus had his odd eye&#xD;
Knock'd out by him, I mean Nobody.&#xD;
