THE CURSE OF ~LJFTON.&#xD;
CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
A DOMESTIC SCENE.&#xD;
A light, commodious chamber,&#xD;
Locking out to the hills, where the shine&#xD;
Of the great sur~ may enter.-MARY HQWITT.&#xD;
NEARLY twelve months have passed since the death of Mr.&#xD;
Clifton. It is October, the most glorious month in the year,&#xD;
when the gorgeous beauty of nature more than satisfies-&#xD;
when it enraptured the soul.&#xD;
I shall introduce you into a chamber, whose three large&#xD;
windows look out upon the scene of glorious magnificence,&#xD;
only to be found when mountains, vales and forests wear&#xD;
their gorgeous autumn livery. It is a very large apartment,&#xD;
so long and lofty, that the great four-post bedstead, standing&#xD;
with its head against the upper end, is n3t in the way. At&#xD;
the lower end of the room, there is an old-fashined fire-place,&#xD;
where an oak fire is burning. The floor is covered with an&#xD;
ingrain carpet, of warm, rich hues. The bedstead, lounge&#xD;
and cushioned chairs are clothed with dark, bright chintz.&#xD;
The windows are curtained with orange-colored damask,&#xD;
Mhich give a mellow, autumnal tone to the atmosphere of the&#xD;
room. The curtains are festooned back, to~ admit the sun-&#xD;
shine, and the glorious view without.&#xD;
The lounge is di~awn up to the left of the fire-place, and&#xD;
Carolyn Clifton, in deep mourning, reclines upon. it. She is&#xD;
very much changed since we saw her last. There is scarcely&#xD;
a trace of het disease left-only a few pits scttttered thinly&#xD;
over the lower part of the chin and throat. IBut she is very,&#xD;
very fragile, and her thin, white face is almost spectral, in&#xD;
(17)&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC7854-00000005"/>&#xD;
contrast with her black dress. Her fair hair has grown out&#xD;
richer, sunnier in hue than before. It is just long enough to'&#xD;
turn, in natural, smooth ringlets, that reach to her throat.&#xD;
And she wears it so. And those bright curls soften and&#xD;
shade the pearly whiteness of her cheek. The expression of&#xD;
her countenance has changed also. It wears a subdued,&#xD;
almost patient air of suffering. She is beautiful, although&#xD;
now that the roundness and bloom of her cheek are gone,&#xD;
she' does not think so. She is beautiful, as she lies there&#xD;
contemplating, with remorseful tenderness, a miniature that&#xD;
she has drawn fr6m her bosom.&#xD;
In the cushion chair, on the right of the fire-place, sits&#xD;
Catherine Kavanagh. She has also changed within the year.&#xD;
Her form is fuller, rounder, more womanly. Her grave,&#xD;
almost stern features, have softened into gentleness. Her&#xD;
voice is softer, and deeper. Its tones indeed are very beauti-&#xD;
ful, and modulated with every shade of feeling. She wears&#xD;
her, hair in the same old style, parted over 'the forehead, rip-&#xD;
pling dQwn in dark, bright wavelets around her cheeks, and&#xD;
carried behind, and woven with the back hair into a large&#xD;
plait, and then rolled round and round into a stwcession of&#xD;
rings-a rich, dark, burnished mass of hair-&#xD;
"Golden where the sunlight phiyed,&#xD;
Bitt where the tendrils sought the shade,&#xD;
Dark, but very beautiful."&#xD;
Her dress of dark brown stuff, with the little white throat~&#xD;
ruffle, and the black silk apron, i5 not very becoming to her.&#xD;
But she thinks too little of her personal appearance , to Care&#xD;
for any quality in her clothing beyond neatness and comfort.&#xD;
She is knitting very leisurely, stopping occasionally to mea-&#xD;
sure the stocking she is engaged upon with the finished one&#xD;
which lies upon her lap. Kate is silent and thoughtful. All&#xD;
her life, up to this date, has been passed in the ministry to&#xD;
sorrow-yes, to all sorts of sorrow-to the suffering arising&#xD;
from vice-to the despair caused by evil passions-to com-&#xD;
mon illness-to pestilence forsaken of all but her-to death!&#xD;
Yes! But little turned of sixteen years of age, and to all&#xD;
these forms of human misery had she been-not a minister-&#xD;
ing angel, but a ministering child and woman-that ministry&#xD;
of sorrow had filled' up all her years, from early childhood,&#xD;
to this hour. Now her days wcre passed in soothing and&#xD;
cheering the solitude and depression of her invalid come&#xD;
&#xD;
panion. And Kate was grave and thoughtful, because she&#xD;
was tempted to think that life was made up of nothing else&#xD;
hut trouble. Her hope in happiness beyond her experience&#xD;
was faint. Her faith was dim. And no wonder. It seemed&#xD;
time she saw some one else's, happiness, if not her own. It&#xD;
wa~ hard to pour the words of faith, hope and cheerfulness&#xD;
into the ear of another, when the fountain in her own heart&#xD;
was failing. It was only a temporary darkening and failing&#xD;
of the spirit. A silent, earnest prayer, and all was ~tlear&#xD;
and strong again. The room was provocative of thought, if&#xD;
not of pensiveness. It was so still and warm and mellow,&#xD;
between the fire and the golden sunshine coming softened&#xD;
through the curtains. And both girls were silent, while&#xD;
Kate leisurely plied her knitting-needles, and Carolyn con-&#xD;
templated the miniature. At last Miss Clifton spoke-&#xD;
"Catherine, look upon that face. Study it. Should you&#xD;
believe, now, that the owner of that beautiful face could be&#xD;
unrelenting, unforgiving 'P' And she passed the miniature&#xD;
to her companion. Kate received it-~--glanced at it. It was&#xD;
a faithful likeness of Archer Clifton. And those features,&#xD;
so long unseen, and now suddenly revealed, thrilled with such&#xD;
electric power to the heart of the girl, that after the first&#xD;
recognizing glance, she instantly returned it. And though&#xD;
her heart had paused in its pulsations, and. now throbbed&#xD;
thick and fast, she answered, calmly-.--&#xD;
"He is not unrelenting or unforgiving, Miss Clifton."&#xD;
"Oh! he is! he is! It has been fifteen months since we&#xD;
parted in anger, and no word or sign from him yet. Oh!&#xD;
Kate, what do you think of it ~"&#xD;
"I think he truly loves you, Miss Carolyn.'~&#xD;
"Oh! he did-he did, but I scorned and insgltedhim, and&#xD;
it iS past, past!"&#xD;
~" There is no past tense to real love, lady."&#xD;
"Ah, Catherine, you speak of what you have had no ex&#xD;
perience in. My scorn killed his. love."&#xD;
"Real love i5 immortal, lady, it cannot be killed."&#xD;
"Ah, child, you speak without knowh~dge."&#xD;
"Without experimental knowledge, Miss Clifton. And all&#xD;
the highest truths we have are obtained without experimen-&#xD;
tal knowledge. I know that true affection is undying, by the&#xD;
same light that without the Bible shows me that God exists&#xD;
-that He made all souls, and that all souls are immortal.&#xD;
It is one of the 'self-evident' truths. Ah, Miss Clifton, true&#xD;

&#xD;
affection can no more be killed by scorn, than an angel could&#xD;
be overcome by a demon, than Heaven could be conquered by&#xD;
hell. In the contest between true affection and scorn, it is&#xD;
affection must conquer-scorn must yield. It must be so,&#xD;
lady. The heavens are pledged to it. The sovereignty of&#xD;
the right is-involved in it. And when, in such a contest, af-.&#xD;
fection fails, it is because it never was true. No, lady, true&#xD;
affection is never conquered. It is scorn that is conquered.&#xD;
It is scorn that has yielded now. You do not scorn him now,&#xD;
lady."&#xD;
"No-I would I could!"&#xD;
"Then, in the death of your own scorn see the immortal-&#xD;
ity of his love. He will come back to you. He will come&#xD;
back the first free moment that he has."&#xD;
"Ab, Catherine! In all this fifteen months he has not&#xD;
written to me."&#xD;
" You do not know that, Miss Carolyn. I believe that he&#xD;
has written to you, and that the letter has been lost. You&#xD;
know how irregular and uncertain the mail is from that&#xD;
distant frontier."&#xD;
"Catherine! I have been thinking of writing to him.&#xD;
What is your opinion ~ What would you advise me to&#xD;
"Not for the world, lady! For, trust me, for every step&#xD;
of advance a woman makes, a man of high honor and fine&#xD;
sensibilities retreats."&#xD;
Miss Clifton's brow flushed, and she made a gesture of im-&#xD;
patience, as she exclaimed-&#xD;
"Then wAy, why knowing that, does he not write ?"&#xD;
"Because, perhaps, his first letters miscarried; and he&#xD;
stopped under the supposition that you would not answer him.&#xD;
And then, lady, under all these circumstances, the stiff pen&#xD;
and the cold paper cannot convey all the burning words he&#xD;
would have to pour out at your feet. He will come !"&#xD;
"'He will come.' Ah! in that very phrase is a knell&#xD;
deeper than all the rest! life will come! And. what a&#xD;
spectre he will see in me! He cannot continue to love me!&#xD;
Impossible! Impossible! He can never love such a faded&#xD;
and scarred ruin as I am."&#xD;
"Dear Miss Clifton, I have told you so often that you are&#xD;
not a ruin! Your face is very lovely, indeed it is! Fair and&#xD;
delicate and pensive, and far more attractive tQ all good&#xD;
hearts than ever it was in its high bloom."&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"Ah, but faded-faded-faded !" mournfully replied&#xD;
~ Carolyn.&#xD;
"And then, dear lady, true affection is of the soul. It&#xD;
has been said that love is blind. It is not so. Love has&#xD;
Divine eyes, and creates the beauty that it looks upon. He&#xD;
will love you the more for the calamity and sorrows that have&#xD;
fallen upon you. He will see a deeper beauty in your pen~&#xD;
sive face, and his love will make it real."&#xD;
"Oh! impossible, I tell you! Impossible! The sight of&#xD;
me would shock him. He would turn away."&#xD;
"Lady, do you love your cousin 'P'&#xD;
"Love him? .Kh, God !"&#xD;
"Dear lady, if he had returned from the frontier with the&#xD;
loss of an arm, a leg, or an eye-or with the hideous scar of&#xD;
a sword cut across cheek and brow, could you have turned&#xD;
from him revolted ~"&#xD;
"Oh, no, no, no! Oh! Heaven, no! I should have&#xD;
done all I could to convince him that he was beautiful&#xD;
to mc still-.that I loved him the deeper for his misfor..&#xD;
tunes !"&#xD;
"Then, dear lady, judge his noble heart by your own."&#xD;
"Ah, but you said yourself, just now, when advising me&#xD;
not to write, that men feel so differently from women !"&#xD;
"Yes, but not in tenderness-not in constancy!"&#xD;
"There is the boy coming from the post office, Catherine!&#xD;
It is strange-it is strange-but though I have been disap-&#xD;
pointed a hundred times, I still hope, and the coming of every&#xD;
mail makes my heart pause! Go, dear Catherine, and see&#xD;
what there is."&#xD;
Kate rolled up her knitting, and dropped it into a little&#xD;
straw basket, and went below.&#xD;
"Only one letter, an' the Pos'-Master say how it war for&#xD;
Miss Carolyn," said the boy below stairs.&#xD;
A letter for her at last! Carolyn's heart stopped almost&#xD;
to death, until Kate ran back up the stairs, entered the room,&#xD;
and placed the letter in her hands.&#xD;
"It is from Richmond," she said, in a disappointed tone,&#xD;
as she opened it.&#xD;
"From my Aunt~Cabell," she added, and began to read&#xD;
it while Kate resumed her knitting.&#xD;
"I hope your friends are all well," said Catherine.&#xD;
"Yes-" replied Miss Clifton; and then a smile of amuse-&#xD;
ment flitted over her face-and still running her eye dowD&#xD;

the letter, she continued-" My Aunt CabelI writes me: that&#xD;
my excellent step-dame, Mrs. Georgia Clifton, is now the&#xD;
reigning belle of Richmond-the most beautiful woman, the&#xD;
most charming musician, the ~most fascinating walti~r, and&#xD;
the most elegant equestrian in the city! She passes for a&#xD;
wealthy (!) young widow-.-and her credit is unlimited, and&#xD;
her debts and hot extravagance, of course, unbounded. She&#xD;
occupies a whole suit of rooms in the most eipensiv~ hotel in&#xD;
the city, and entertains around her; both day and night, a&#xD;
host o~ adoring worshipers. She has cut her father-.--worthy&#xD;
man-dead! She is going to bring down a party of ladies&#xD;
and gentlemen to spend Christmas at her country.-seat, (!)&#xD;
White Cliffs. Now what do you think of that, Catherine ~&#xD;
Pray Heaven she may marry soon, and not wear our name&#xD;
long enough to- scandalize it! Mrs. Cabell goes on to say,&#xD;
that Mrs. Georgia cannot long play that game-i--that Archer&#xD;
Clifton must soon return, and take possession of his property,&#xD;
when it will be arrested. Alas! she does not know that&#xD;
Uaptain Olifhn is as much under the dominion of that dan-&#xD;
gerous woman as it is possible to be. He will probably be&#xD;
proud to leave Mrs. Clifton in possession here. as long as she&#xD;
finds it convenient or agreeable to stay. Now, what do you&#xD;
think of all this, Catherine ~"&#xD;
"Dear lady, I know that you feel very unpleasantly, that&#xD;
all those gay city strangers should be coming down here at&#xD;
-Christmas, to turn the imuiet house into a ball of orgies.&#xD;
But I do not see how you can prevent it. You can elude it,&#xD;
Though! You can go to llardbargain, you lcnow, and remain&#xD;
until Mrs. Georgia and her guests have departed again. Ii&#xD;
would do that."&#xD;
"No, dear Catherine, there will be no necessity for that,&#xD;
either! My Aunt Cabill has anticip4ed ixiy embarrassment,&#xD;
and proposed a plan. My aunt and all her family are com-&#xD;
mg-down here to spend the months of October and Novem-&#xD;
ber, while their city mansion is un4ergoing repairs-paint..&#xD;
ing, papering, and so on. And she proposes that I shall&#xD;
return with ~her at the first of December, and pass the Win-&#xD;
ter in Richmond."&#xD;
~ And will you go i"'&#xD;
"I do- not know. But, Kate, dear, you have comforted&#xD;
me so much, 'and aunt's account of Mrs. Georgia's city airs&#xD;
has diverted me so much; that IL think I have spirits for a&#xD;
ride! Go ordar the horses, and tell Dandy to be ready to&#xD;

attend us. We will go up to Ilardbargain and take tea with&#xD;
Aunt Clifton, and amuse her with this letter !"&#xD;
Mrs. Cabell and her daughters, attended by Major Cabell,&#xD;
arrived in due time, and were received with- great pleasure&#xD;
by their orphaned relative. And Catherine, now~ that she&#xD;
was no longer necessary to the cheerfulness of Miss Clifton,&#xD;
took leave and returned to her brother's cot. Life' in the&#xD;
mansion, and life in the hut,'like day and night, about equally&#xD;
divided the girl's experience-a strange lot, to be ever alter-&#xD;
iiating between luxury and refinement, and poverty and&#xD;
coarseness. And though it was a wonderfully strengthening&#xD;
discipline, Kate found -the contrast so painful as to wish&#xD;
that life would' change-in some way.&#xD;
A month passed away-during which she heard nothing&#xD;
whatever from White Cliffs. She was therefore in tot~d&#xD;
ignorance of what was going on there, until one cold morn-&#xD;
ing that had succeeded a snow-stormy night, 'while she was&#xD;
shoveling away the snow in front of the cottage door, 'Daiidy&#xD;
rode up and delivered 'her a note from Miss Clifton. The&#xD;
note ran thus:&#xD;
"DEAR CATH~nINE,-..&#xD;
"I am going to leave for Richmond with Aunt Clifton to..&#xD;
morrow morning. Come over, dear girl, and: let me, take&#xD;
leave of you before; I start. Come, my good, wise Catherine,&#xD;
for I want to consult you about a certain matter.&#xD;
"Your friend,'         CAROLYN.'?&#xD;
Kate saddlc4 her pony and set out, attended by Dandy.&#xD;
As soon as she arrived at White Cliffs, she was invited im-&#xD;
mediately up into Miss Clifton's room~ She found the young&#xD;
lady surrounded with trunks and bandboxes, ai~d busy with&#xD;
her maids, packing. Carolyn dismissed her' attendants, beg-&#xD;
ged Kate to be seated, and sat down by her. After a few&#xD;
mutual inquiries about health and so on, and a little intro-&#xD;
ductory conversation and some considerable hesitation, Miss&#xD;
Clifton said-&#xD;
"Catherine! I think-I hope that I have succeeded at&#xD;
last in emancipating myself from the degrading slavery of&#xD;
that old love spell! At last the dread sense of bereavement&#xD;
and desolation is deadened. - . . . . . If II were&#xD;

to see him again, however, I do not know how it might&#xD;
be.' . . . . Perhaps, though, I shall never see hi~n&#xD;
again...........Kate! I have had a proposal for mar-&#xD;
riage. . . . My cousin Major Cabell! . . . . It&#xD;
was at least generous in him, all things considered&#xD;
Family feeling, I suppose...........Kate, I think of&#xD;
accepting him! . . '. . . We owe something to our&#xD;
position in society. . . . My Aunt Cabell has been&#xD;
talking to me about it for a month past."&#xD;
Miss Clifton made this communication in a hesitating,&#xD;
disjointed manner; while Catherine looked and listened in&#xD;
grief and astonishment, feeling regret amounting almost to&#xD;
remorse, that she had left her friend, enfeebled in mind and&#xD;
body, so long under the influence of a strong-willed&#xD;
thoroughly worldly-minded woman. And she understood&#xD;
the instinct that had impelled the wavering girl to send for&#xD;
her to i~teady her. And then athwart these, her purest eme-&#xD;
tions, swept a dark, burning impulse, like a breath of hell.&#xD;
was the whisper of the devil, and it said to hcr,-"Agree.&#xD;
with her-agree with her! Let her marry another if she&#xD;
wishes, and thus remove the greatest impediment that sepa-&#xD;
rates you from the love, the hope of Archer Clifton."&#xD;
Catherine stood for a moment horrified by the darkness of&#xD;
the temptation. But then summoning the whole strength&#xD;
of her soul, she inwardly exclaimed, "Get thee behind me,&#xD;
satan !" And the devil fled from her.&#xD;
"You do not answer me, Catherine. My dear girl, I have&#xD;
so much confidence in your rectitude of mind! Advise&#xD;
me!"&#xD;
"Dear Miss Clifton, never, as you value your whole life's -&#xD;
peace. and rectitude-never, for any purpose wbatever-un-&#xD;
der any temptation whatever-consent to marry a man you&#xD;
do not love; never, as you hope for earthly content-as you&#xD;
trust in God-never put an insurmountable object between&#xD;
yourself and one you love! How criminal to become a wife,&#xD;
while you love another living man! How terrible to find&#xD;
out, when it is too late, that he loves you still! Perhaps&#xD;
from year to year to long for the-! Lady, I have no wdrds&#xD;
strong enough to express to you all that I feel and fear on&#xD;
this subject! Grave faults sometimes follow little errors!&#xD;
I would fain gain your promise not to entertain any gentle..&#xD;
man's, suit until you have met again with Captain Clifton!&#xD;
You cannot have long to wait. Ho must return to' settle up&#xD;
&#xD;
this estate. And legal business, if nothing else, must bring&#xD;
you together !"&#xD;
"Alas! alas'! no! the affairs of this property will be set-&#xD;
tled by his attorney. Kate, I am very miserable !"&#xD;
"Pear lady, I know' it! 'IDe not, when tempted by hope-&#xD;
lessness, do that which you may regret all your life! That&#xD;
which may shut out the possibility of liap~iness forever! I&#xD;
wish I could go t&amp;amp;'Richniond with' yolx."'&#xD;
"'Oh, I wish you could! I think thali you' could' save me&#xD;
from danger, Kate."&#xD;
"I think you want an honest fri~n&amp;amp; near you, Miss Clif.~&#xD;
ton! But, one thing you ean do-you e~am resolve not to&#xD;
form any matrimonial engagement until? you have again' met&#xD;
with Captain Clifton. And you can bind your resolution by&#xD;
a promise. Promise me, dear lady, by the interest I take in&#xD;
you, to hold yourself free from entanglements, until you see&#xD;
your cousin!"&#xD;
"Kate !-yes, I solemnly promise you, by alil I hold sa-&#xD;
cred, that' I will do as you advise in this matter! And,&#xD;
Kate, enfeebled asI am, or may become, in mind or body, I&#xD;
cannot 'break' my pledged word! Good girl! You have&#xD;
saved me again! Oh, Kate! Kate! do you~ think I don't&#xD;
know the full extent of your disinterestedness ~ Oh, Kate!&#xD;
noble girl! God reward you !"&#xD;
Catherine began to tremble so violently, that Miss Clifton&#xD;
threw her arms around her, and pressed her to her bosom,&#xD;
whispering,&#xD;
"Never fear, dear girl! sweet girl! I will not breathe&#xD;
another word! I would as soon sacrilegiously snatch the&#xD;
veil from the sanctuary, as breathe another word about it !"&#xD;
When Catherine reached home in the afternoon, she found&#xD;
a message waiting her, from Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain.&#xD;
She went up immediately to the farm-house, and'found that&#xD;
lady looking very happy.&#xD;
"Catherine, my dear, sit down. I have good news. 'I have&#xD;
3ust received a letter from Archer. He will be in Richmond&#xD;
in four days from this! But his duties are such that he will&#xD;
not be able to leave Richmond for some weeks. He begs&#xD;
me to meet him there! He has been promoted, Kate! He&#xD;
is now Major Cliftoii, and has been appointed aid-de-eamp to&#xD;
the GoVernor !"&#xD;

"I am rejoiced to hear it, madam," replied Kate, calmly,&#xD;
though her heart stood still with the suddenness of this&#xD;
news. "You will send over and inform Miss Clifton, will&#xD;

"No, I think not, Catherine. Why excite and disturb&#xD;

"I shall be very glad to do so, indeed, Mrs. Clifton !" said&#xD;
the young girl.&#xD;
"Then return home at once, Kate, and prepare for the&#xD;

THE CURSE OF VLIFTQN.&#xD;
&#xD;
- CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
INTHE CITY.&#xD;
In a proud city and rich-&#xD;
Acity fair and old,&#xD;
Filled with the world's most costly things,&#xD;
Of precious stones and gold;&#xD;
Of silks, fine wool, and spiceries,&#xD;
And all that's bought and sold.-MARY HeWITT.&#xD;
ON her arrival at Richmond, Mrs. Clifton engaged for her~-        Li&#xD;
self and Catherine two rooms-a chamber with two beds,&#xD;
and a neat adjoining parlor-in a quiet, retired ~boarding-&#xD;
house.&#xD;
Miss Clifton was the guest of Mrs. Cabell, in the most&#xD;
fashionable quarter of the city. Captain Clifton had not yet&#xD;
arrived, btit was daily expected. Richmond was in the com-&#xD;
mencement of the fashionable season, and was already quite&#xD;
full of gay company. Every evening witnessed some one or&#xD;
two grand balls, or great private parties. The theatres and&#xD;
the concert rooms were in full operation. But no faint echo&#xD;
of all these various forms of revelry came to the sequestered&#xD;
neighborhood that Mrs. Clifton had chosen for her retreat.&#xD;
No news of the fashionable world reached her, except con-&#xD;
stant bulletins of Mrs.,Georgia Cliften's progress through&#xD;
society. She was one of' those city celebrities whose sayings&#xD;
and doings are the exciting topic of all classes. Where she&#xD;
went, and what she wore, and when she rode out. Whom&#xD;
she cut directly, whom she smiled upon, whom she slighted,.~&#xD;
and whom she received, were the most interesting subjects&#xD;
of discussion. The Belle of the Rappahannock, the Dark&#xD;
Ladye, the Gipsy Beauty, were some of the many names sh~e&#xD;
had won. All theae matters were freely and lightly com-&#xD;
mented upon in Mrs. Clifton's presence, by gentlemen board-&#xD;
ers, who knew nothing whatever of that lady's connexion&#xD;
with the reigning toast of Richmond. Mrs. Clifton rested&#xD;
two days 'before calling upon Mrs. Cabell and her family.&#xD;
Miss Clifton expressed almost. as much surprise as ~lcasure       I&#xD;

&#xD;
at the sight of her aunt, but forebore to question her motive&#xD;
in coming so suddenly to the city. Perhaps Carolyn had&#xD;
heard a rumor of Major Clifton's preferment and expected&#xD;
arrival, and for that reason was silent. Mrs. Clifton never&#xD;
named the subject during her infornial call. At taking leave&#xD;
she left her address, and informed her niece that Kate&#xD;
Kavanagh was in ~town with her. Carolyn expressed much&#xD;
pleasure at hearing this, and promised to call very soon.&#xD;
The very next day Mrs. Cabell came in her carriage, and in-&#xD;
vited and urged Mrs. Clifton and her prot~g~ to return with&#xD;
her, and make her house their home during their sojourn in&#xD;
Richmond. After some hesitation and reflection, Mrs. Clif~.&#xD;
ton, accepted the invitation, and promised to go over the next&#xD;
day. The next morning, therefore, Mrs. Cabell sent her&#xD;
carriage to convey Mrs. Clifton and. Catherine. They were&#xD;
received by Mrs. Cabell with great politei~iess and emyresse-&#xD;
ment, ana conducted by thatiady herself into two large and&#xD;
luxuriously furnished, chambers, connected with each other,&#xD;
where they found a neat, pretty mulatto girl, ready to wait&#xD;
upon them-for Mrs. Cabell, with all her hard wordliness,&#xD;
was truly kind and hospitable.&#xD;
The evening of the succeeding day was the appointed time&#xD;
tor the Governor's first reception. 'Mrs. Cabell and her&#xD;
family were going, of course. And Mrs. Clifton resolved to&#xD;
go-not for her own sake, hut for that of Catherine, whom&#xD;
she had determined should see all that was to be seen during&#xD;
her stay in the metropolis. A somewhat haughty surprise&#xD;
elevated the handsome black eyebrows of Mrs. Cabell, when&#xD;
she found that Mrs. Clifton intended to take her demo'i~eli&amp;amp;&#xD;
du compagnie, but. she was far too well bred to express it in&#xD;
any other manner. . And as for Mrs. Clifton, she always did&#xD;
whatever she -thought proper to do, in the coolest, calmest,.&#xD;
most matter-of-course manner, without the slightest regard&#xD;
to other people's weaknesses and follies~ You know, besides,&#xD;
that she was a thorough republican. And Mrs. Cabell re-&#xD;
membered that the public' reception at the gubernatorial&#xD;
mansion was a sort of omnizsm gathenim, where all who be-&#xD;
haved themselves night conie-from the oldest Major-Gene-&#xD;
ral of the army to the shoemaker who made his boots. And&#xD;
again, x~o one in Richmond knew who the girl really was.&#xD;
All these things had Mrs. Cabell to recall to mind 'before she&#xD;
could reconcile herself to the idea of Kate's being of the&#xD;
party9&#xD;
&#xD;
When the night and the hour arrived, several gentlemen,&#xD;
beaux of the Misses Cabell, came to escort the ladies. Major&#xD;
Cabell attended his cousin Carolyn and one of his sisters.&#xD;
Judge Cabell took charge of his wife and eldest daughter.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton had hoped that her son would have reached the&#xD;
city in time to have escorted herself and Catherine. When&#xD;
they were all assembled in the parlor, Major Cabell brought&#xD;
a gentleman up to Mrs. Clifton, whom he presented as Colo-&#xD;
nel Conyers, of the army, leaving to Mrs. Clifton the respon..&#xD;
sibility of presenting the aristocrat to the plebeian Kate. Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton did it at once, in the most natural way in the world.&#xD;
And the gallant Colonel, after a few. compliments, hoped to&#xD;
have the honor of waiting upon Mrs. Clifton and her "lovely&#xD;
charge" to the Mansion House. Mrs. Clifton gratefully&#xD;
accepted his services-and soon after, they entered the car-&#xD;
riage, and' were driven off. This party reached their desti-&#xD;
nation a full half hour before Mrs. Cabell and family, and&#xD;
other ultra fashionable, who fancied that it was vulgar to go&#xD;
early, and imagined that their ton depended upon late hours&#xD;
and other observances. Mrs. Clifton was very plainly dressed,&#xD;
in a black satin with a lace scarf-Catherine very simply, in&#xD;
a white crape, with a scarlet geranium twined in her black'&#xD;
hair. A moment in the cloak-room sufficed to' re-arrange&#xD;
their simple. toilet. They were then conducted into the&#xD;
saloon. This apartment was fitted up in a somewhat differ-&#xD;
ent style to those of the present day. 'It was illuminated by&#xD;
three large hanging. chandeliers, holding innumerable wax&#xD;
candles; and warmed by two enormous coal fires, one at&#xD;
each extremity.' It was already well filled with a miscella-&#xD;
neous company. After their presentation to the Governor,&#xD;
Colonel Conyers inquired whether they chose to joir~ the&#xD;
promenade or to take seats. Mrs. Clifton preferred the lat-&#xD;
ter, and their polite escort conducted them to a side sofa,&#xD;
from which. they could note the entrance of fresh guests, and&#xD;
watch the great circle of promenades going round and round&#xD;
in one long elliptic, three or four persons deep, in the most&#xD;
stupid, treadmill monotony conceivable. Very much inter-&#xD;
ested and amused wa~ our simple country girl, in taking ob-&#xD;
servations of the various characters passingg in review before&#xD;
them. Here mould be a dowager of sixty, in rouge, ring-&#xD;
lets, bare arms and a gossamer dress; here' a girl of seven-&#xD;
teen, in a black, stiff brocade and heavy headdress. Here&#xD;

red-faced, sharp-featured little man, very quick and impa-&#xD;
tient in his motions, and very high in his voice-he looks&#xD;
like an auctioneer or a constable-.-.he is the great General&#xD;
of the United States Army. Here is a smsil, dowdy&#xD;
woman, all fuss and flowers, like a barn-house actress-she&#xD;
is the wife of the late Gov~wnor . This is a queenly&#xD;
woman! tall, stately, dignified, with a fine, royal counte..&#xD;
nance. Pooh! Don't ask who she is-she is the c~ leading&#xD;
lady" at the city theatre-plays in all the heavy tragedies,&#xD;
but is not even a star. There, apart, watching and reflect..&#xD;
ing~upon the scene, stands a grave-looking individual, in a&#xD;
closely-fitting black suit, and closely-cropped black hair, and&#xD;
set, sallow, saturnine face, looking like an undertaker at a&#xD;
funeral-doubtless some famous preavher~.-though so niiser-&#xD;
able a messenger of the glad tidings cannot be imagined.&#xD;
Preacher, indeed! Why, he is H----., the low comedian~&#xD;
and he wears ~his hair cropped that way by reason of the.&#xD;
~nany different sorts of wigs he has to wear in his different&#xD;
impersonations. To-night, he happens to be off the boards,&#xD;
and enjoys the recreation of sadness and gravity. Ak! here&#xD;
is a debonnair gentleman! all life! a laugh and jest, or a.&#xD;
smile and a bow for every one. Is he .a French dancixig-&#xD;
master ~ No-he is the Rev. Mr. , the most pDpular&#xD;
preacher of the day. Yet these were not all. There was a&#xD;
small proportion of really well-dres8ed and dignified women,&#xD;
and stately, honorable men.&#xD;
"How do you like the scene, Catherine iP' a~ked Mrs~&#xD;
Clifton.&#xD;
Kate laughed-~--then replied-&#xD;
"I am somewhat disappointed, but very much more di-&#xD;
verted! It seems to me so strange that people should look,&#xD;
dres~ and behave so very inappropriately! and, that~ they&#xD;
could. possibly be se very ill-dressed and dowdy at such a&#xD;
great expense~ I expected sQmethlng very rechereh~ and&#xD;
eleganV in the saloon~of'the~Governor's mansion. But '~ot-&#xD;
ley is the only wear~!'"&#xD;
The officer laughed, g~yly, and then observed-&#xD;
"Why ~ Why did you look for something, or rather, ~'or&#xD;
everything recherch6 ar~d elegant in this crowd ~ Because&#xD;
you se~ in the newspaper; reports of such gatherings~ such&#xD;
phrases as 'the beautifulMis A~-.-----~ '~'-by-the-w&amp;amp;y, there&#xD;
&#xD;
she is-the young lady with the red hair, milk-white coin-&#xD;
plexion and little eyes; or 'the elegant Mrs. B V 'the&#xD;
graceful Mrs. C V etc., etc., etc., with revised and&#xD;
improved accounts of their costume, appearance, manners,&#xD;
etc. ~ Miss Kavanagh, when you have stayed in the city&#xD;
longer, you will know that when a newspaper reporter and&#xD;
letter writer speaks of that dowdy, but wealthy little woman,&#xD;
in the flimsy, scarlet dress, as 'the beautiful, elegant, and&#xD;
accomplished Mrs. G ,' and tells of 'the immense&#xD;
(imaginary) sensation' she made-he, the reporter, is morally&#xD;
certain of an invitation to her private parties."&#xD;
Kate did not like his sarcastic tone, but before she could&#xD;
make any sort of reply, her attention was called to a ri~ng&#xD;
excitement in the room. lEvery gentleman, from the fid-&#xD;
getty little Major General, down to the grave and dignified&#xD;
low comedian; and every lady, from the ex-Governor's fussy&#xD;
widow, to the stately and self-possessed stock actress, were&#xD;
on the qui vive. Kate, wThle listening and watching for the&#xD;
cause of the excitement, caught a few phrases that helped to&#xD;
enlighten her-they were of this sort :-" A wonder! a perfect&#xD;
wonder! A miracle of dark beauty.." "The wealthiest woman&#xD;
jn the state, but that is nothing to her marvelous beauty?'&#xD;
"Did you see her as 'Egypt,' at the fancy ball V' "Her&#xD;
portrait, in oil, by -, stands in Stationers' Hall. It has&#xD;
attracted crowds." "No-I have seen the engraving from&#xD;
it in 'Beauty's Annual' for this year. But I have also seen&#xD;
it on the -tops of cigar boxes-too bad !" "ilush! here she&#xD;
comes !".&#xD;
Catherine turned her eyes in the direction towards which&#xD;
all others were gazing. It was Georgia-dark, bright, and&#xD;
more beautiful and bewitching than ever. Her dress was of&#xD;
lustrous black crape-de-lise, sprinkled over with gold spangles,&#xD;
that gleamed in and out through the dark, transparent dra..&#xD;
pery, suggesting. clear, starlight night. A crowd entered&#xD;
with the star-bright Circe-a crowd attended her during all&#xD;
her progress through the room.&#xD;
We must leave Georgia to her alluring wiles, and Cathe-&#xD;
rine to her observations, and seek Mrs. Cabell and her party.&#xD;
They are in the dressing-room, and about to leave it. Only&#xD;
Mrs. Cabell turns again and again to survey her form in the&#xD;
mirror, and re-adjust the flow of her purple satin dress, or the&#xD;
wave of her white ostrich plumes. When all is done, she&#xD;
turns for the last time to Carolyn, to rebuke her for not add-&#xD;

which is relieved only by the falls of fine Brussels lace on&#xD;
the neck and arms, and the sunny ringlets falling all around&#xD;
her head as low as the throat. '~ Carolyn looks very fragile,&#xD;
but interesting and' lovely, though she does not know it.&#xD;
Major Cabell gave his right arm to his mother, and his left&#xD;
to his cousin, and so, as it was now the acme of the fashion-&#xD;
able hour, they entered the' saloon, and made their slow pro-&#xD;
gress up to' the upper end, where the Governor and staff&#xD;
stood, to receive all comers-Mrs. Cabell bowing and smiling&#xD;
to such acquaintances as she chose to recognize in passing,&#xD;
until at length they stopped. A feeling of false shame, a&#xD;
xn*id notion that all eyes were upon her, and scrutinized&#xD;
the few pits hidden under the golden curls on her temples,&#xD;
had caused Carolyn to cast her eyes down, and keep them&#xD;
down, during the whole progress through 'the room-and&#xD;
though' her acute ears heard such murmurs as these-" Row&#xD;
fair she is," "But how fragile, as if a zephyr would blow her&#xD;
away "-she never fancied' they were breathed of her, and&#xD;
never surmised the admiration she elicited. "Governor&#xD;
T , Miss Clifton, of (Jlifton," were the words that ad'.&#xD;
inonished Carolyn she was standing before the great man,&#xD;
and must look up and curtsy. She curtsied before she&#xD;
looked up, and when she ~raised her eyes, she saw only Archer&#xD;
Clifton before her, who bowed when he met her glance! The&#xD;
Governor'and many others were there, but how could she see&#xD;
any one but Archer Clifton! But, oh! the perversity of&#xD;
human nature! As soon as she met his eyes~ all the pride&#xD;
and scorn of'her proudest, most scornful days, returned upon&#xD;
her with' a vengeance-all the more fiercely, ferocidusly, that&#xD;
she believed herself a fright, and found Archer Clifton hand-&#xD;
somer, more dignified, higher in favor with God and man than&#xD;
ever! Major Cabell was about, to pass on instantly with his&#xD;
ladies, to give place to the 'next arrivals. Returning Archer&#xD;
Clifton's bOw with i~ haughty bend, she threw up her head&#xD;
and'swept~on with the most superb air of arrogance'imagina~-&#xD;

unhappy for her show of hauteur-the heart beneath that&#xD;

Suddenly both became grave and thoughtful-they were&#xD;
occupied&amp;amp; with the same thonghts-~-.-of the calamities that bad&#xD;
befallen mutual friends since their, last parting. They were&#xD;
silent-they did not like to sadden this first meeting by ire-~&#xD;
ferring to the mournful subjt~ct. And before either knew, of&#xD;
her approach, Mis.. Georgia had glided swiftly and silently&#xD;
up to them. NQW, Mrs. Georgia had.. passed a~td repassed&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton a score of times that evening, without once no-,&#xD;
ticing her. But now that archer Clifton ~at by h~sm9ther's&#xD;
side, the Circe appeared before them, dark, resplendent,~&#xD;
alhwing as~, ever. She. was leaning upon tl~e arm of the&#xD;
Liqutenaut.Governor. 'Archer Clifton sprang up i~ume-,&#xD;
diately, and greeted her with surprise an~ pleasure. iDismiss-'&#xD;
ing herescort with a oharn~ing smile and ~rave, of, the hand,&#xD;
she sank graceftilly, lauguis~in'gly into the~'seat' by ~he side&#xD;
of Mrs. Clifton, and glided into. ber own fascipat.ing ~tyle of&#xD;
conversation.. After &amp;amp;fe~ minutes', Archer Clifton seemed~&#xD;
quite lost to everything else, in the charm of the syren's.&#xD;
society, until a certa~p, SWeet, enticing restl~ssness qn ,the&#xD;
part of the beauty, ~uggeste4: to him the propriety of inviting.&#xD;
her to promenade.. She. aro~e with a bewildering smile, that&#xD;
quite drove his mother out of "his heads and slipped~her, arm,&#xD;
through his. They joined the promenades. In [the mean-&#xD;
time, Kate Kavanagh, on the ~rnvof Cokrnel, Conyors, was&#xD;
moving around in the same circle, highly amused in ~m~I~ing&#xD;

observations, and scarcely appreciating the sincere admiration&#xD;
of her eCcort, that was apparent to every one else, especially&#xD;
to the dorr~esp6r~dent of the Fiddle-de.~dee, who, in his next&#xD;
letter', in giving an account of the reception, made an item of&#xD;
* the manifest admiration of the gallant and distinguished&#xD;
Colonel C , for the beautifi4 and accomplished Miss&#xD;
K-~----~--. Cathei~ine at length thought that her kind pa-&#xD;
troness might be lonely~ and expressed a wish to i'ejoin her.&#xD;
In turning to retrace their steps; they met face to face with&#xD;
Archer Clifton and his companion. Major' Clifton recognized&#xD;
the poor mountain' girl in that saloon, With' a' look of super-&#xD;
cilious surprise, and Mrs. Georgia looked 'calmly through her&#xD;
IU~ without seeing her at all. With a slight bow, Major&#xD;
Clifton passed o~i with his companion. 'And as for Kate, her&#xD;
heart had a habit of ~t~nding perfectly still in an emergency,&#xD;
and now it had stopped so suddenly, and stood still so long,&#xD;
that she' was cxi the verge of fainting.&#xD;
"You ~are, not well. You are wearied. You have re-&#xD;
i~ained' on your feet too long. Let me take you to a seat,&#xD;
Miss Kavanagh," said the~ Colonel. With a 'gasp and a&#xD;
shiver, Kate recovered and rejoined Mrs. Clifton. And sheper-&#xD;
mitted' herself to fall into no more weakness that night. But'&#xD;
Kate had unconsciously betrayed her secret 'to the officer.&#xD;
And by the interference of her good angel, this knowledge&#xD;
thus obtained, enabledd ~Colonel Conyers to do Kate a' service&#xD;
of vital iinpo~'tanee'in' after years.&#xD;
"Archer is come," sai&amp;amp; Mrs. Clifton, as Catherine took&#xD;
her seat.      '.    '&#xD;
"' I ~know it. 'I met him," repJied Catherine,. and both'&#xD;
fell, into silence, for at that instant Major Clift~on and the&#xD;
beautiful Georgia passed them. And from that time, and so&#xD;
long as they sat ~there, agaiti and again in the'slow revolving&#xD;
of the great circle 'of promenaders, the pair passed and re-&#xD;
passed th~m-..Georgia smiling, cooing, murmuring, jn' her&#xD;

wjtti his brilliant gray 'eye's, feeding, 'on' her ,lovely face,&#xD;

Archer Clifton is not in love with his uncle's' widow-tbat&#xD;
very relationship would repel the idea, if nothing else. But&#xD;
he is not indifferent to the, honor of monopolizing the reign-&#xD;
lug queen of the ton.&#xD;
"Aunt Cabell," said Carolyn, "I cannot sit up longer. I&#xD;
must go home.&#xD;
'And Mrs. Cabell consented to. gratify her wish. In fact&#xD;
it was growing late, and the ultra'.fashionables, the last to&#xD;
come, and the firs1~ to leave, were beginning to disappear.'&#xD;
Mrs. Georgia unwillingly discovered this fact, but she thought&#xD;
that at least she could adroitly secure ~the services of her&#xD;
companion as an escort home, and 'detain him to any ho in&#xD;
'the little paradise of' her own boudoir.', She 'therefor -&#xD;
pressed herself euxinied, and entreated Major Clifton to -&#xD;
duct her to the cloak-room. He attended her thither. And&#xD;
there he met again his Cousin Carolyn. She' lookeil so fair,&#xD;
so wan, so fragile, that he could not for a moment take his&#xD;
eyes from her. He hastily adjusted the mantle' over the&#xD;
shoulders of Georgia, handed her her muff and hood, and&#xD;
excusing himself for a moment, hurried back to his. mother's&#xD;
side.&#xD;
"You have company home, madam, have you not V~&#xD;
"Certainly, Areher. I should not be here without&#xD;
such a provision-here comes Colonel ~Conyers now to at-'&#xD;
tend us,"&#xD;
"Good-night, then! I will see you early to-morrow!&#xD;
Good-night, Kate !" He was off.&#xD;
Mrs. Cabell and Carolyn, leaning on Major Cabell's arms,&#xD;
reached' their carriage door. The Major dropped his cousin's"&#xD;
arm a moment to ~assist his mother in, and to settle her in&#xD;
her seat. And during that ~moment Carolyn felt~an arm&#xD;
passed arQund her waist, and a voice whisper-&#xD;
"Carolyn-my beloved cousin! my bride! am I for-&#xD;
given'?"&#xD;
She burst into tears and dropped 'her proud head on 'hip&#xD;
bosom, e~elaiming-.-. '&#xD;
"Oh, Archer! am I forgiven'?"&#xD;
He placed her iu the carriage, and springing in past Major&#xD;
Cabell, took the seat by her side, leaving the Major to&#xD;
follow as he could, and forgetting the very existence of Mrs.&#xD;
Georgia.&#xD;
Kate was close to them-she saw and heard it all. Nod..&#xD;
ding her head slowly several times, she murmured-&#xD;

Three weeks after this they were married. The ceremony&#xD;
was performed in the ancient church of St. John's on Rich-&#xD;
mond Hill-one of the oldest places of worship on the whole&#xD;
continent. Mrs. Cabell would willingly have made this event&#xD;
the occasion of a great deal of .ostentatious display; bui the&#xD;
recent afflictions in the family, and the fragility of the bride,&#xD;
rendered other arrangements necessary. Therefore, imme-&#xD;
diately after the ceremony, which came off at an early hour&#xD;
of the morning, the newly-married couple, taking advantage&#xD;
o    e very fine weather, departed for Norfolk, with the in-&#xD;
n of sailing thence to Havana, where, by the advice&#xD;
of an eminent physician, for the re-establishment of the bride's&#xD;
health, they purposed to spend the winter.&#xD;
Mrs. Georgia Clifton; with all the other members of the&#xD;
family~ connection, had, of course, been present at the mar-&#xD;
riage. And no one was so lavish ,of smiles, tears, caresses,&#xD;
and congratulations, as the dark-eyed syren. But when all&#xD;
wa~ over, and the bridal pair had departed, refusing the in-&#xD;
vitation of Mrs. Cabell to go home and dine with a party of&#xD;
friends, ~he hurried to her lodgings, pushed epen the door&#xD;
of her luxurious boudoir, fastened it on the inside, and threw&#xD;
herself down, rolling over, tearing at the carpet, and gnash~.&#xD;
ing her teeth in an agony of disappointment, jealousy and&#xD;
impotent rage~&#xD;
But not long did the Circe of Richmond yield herself up&#xD;
to anguish and despair. Christmas was approaching, when&#xD;
she was expected to entertain a select number ~of her wor~&#xD;
shippers at White Cliffs. It was expedient that ~he should&#xD;
go ~down a few days in advance of' the party, to' make ready&#xD;
for their reception. Therefore, about five days. after the&#xD;
marriage, she left the city.&#xD;
NIrs. Clifton remained a week longer in town, to give&#xD;
Catherine an opportunity of attending a course of lectures&#xD;
on Moral Philosophy. And their escort every evening was&#xD;
Colo~iel Conyers.&#xD;

For some x~iust watch while some may sleep,&#xD;
So rims the world away.-SuAKsr~~Aa~.&#xD;
IT was always Mrs. Clifton's rule to spend Chtistwas at&#xD;
home-so she arranged to leave Richmond ~on the twenty-&#xD;
third. It was three o'clock on the dark, cold, winter moi'n-&#xD;
ing, that the stage eall&amp;amp;d for them. Our travelers were&#xD;
muffled up to the ears in hoods, cloaks, shawls and 'furs, and&#xD;
when they entered the coach, they seemed to fill up all the&#xD;
back. It was so' dark that they1 could see nothing, and the&#xD;
stage seemed to be vacant of other passengers than them~&#xD;
selves; until Mrs. Clifton, settling her own outer ~garments,&#xD;
spoke, cautioning Catherine ~to fold 'her cloak carefully about&#xD;
her. Then another voice spoke, from the opposite seat, ex-&#xD;
clainAng, in a tone of si~rprise and pleasure-&#xD;
"Why, is it possible! 'Mrs. Clifton and Miss Kavanagh '?"I.'&#xD;
"Yes, Colonel Conyers, and 'I am as much pleased as sur-'&#xD;
prised to find you here! How comes it that we are fellow&#xD;
travelers 'i" said the lady, placing her own in his o~ered&#xD;
hand.&#xD;
"And how do you do, Miss Kavariagh ?.-.really, I aui so&#xD;
overjoyed to find you here! Why, you must know, my dear&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton, that I have been due at White~Cliffs for several&#xD;
days. I am, in fact,4he laggard of a party.-.~but in truth&#xD;
I could not tear myself from Richmond, while you an&amp;amp;,Miss&#xD;
Kavanagh remained~ But last night, after taking leave of&#xD;
you, as I supposed, for some length of time,-..under great&#xD;
depression of spirits, ]~Iiss liavanagh,-I sent and hada place&#xD;
taken in this stage, for L------.,'which I understand to be&#xD;
the nearest stage station to White Cliffs. Why, how~ little&#xD;
did I suspect that we were to travel by the sam~ coach!&#xD;

&#xD;
Truly, 'life is full of paper walls.' .A word dropped by either&#xD;
of us, last night, would have revealed the fact to the other!&#xD;
But how delighted I am, Miss Kavanagh! And may I hope,&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton; that our journey lies for some distance together~"&#xD;
"For the whole distance, I am happy to say. The plan..&#xD;
nation of White Cliffs and the farm of Hardbargain join.&#xD;
Our journey terminates at L------."&#xD;
"Really! Why this is excellent! So, instead of being&#xD;
separated, we shall travel all the way together, and then con..&#xD;
tinue to be neighbors for some weeks! Miss Kavanagh, I&#xD;
am overjoyed."&#xD;
ere was not much traveling at that season of the year,&#xD;
party of three had the coach to themselves, and Colonel&#xD;
Conyers devoted himself with great assiduity to the comfort&#xD;
of the ladies.&#xD;
At the end of the second day, just as the level beams of&#xD;
the setting sun were gilding all the village windows, the stage&#xD;
~rolkd into L&#xD;
There, before the little tavern door, waited Mrs. Clifton's&#xD;
old-fashioned carriage.&#xD;
"Did you notify the family of White Cliffs of your in-&#xD;
tended arrival here to-day ~?" asked Mrs. Clifton, of Colonel&#xD;
Conyers.&#xD;
"No, madam! My journey was resolved upon so sud-&#xD;
denly-out of 'my grief and my impatience' at the supposed&#xD;
loss of your own and Miss Kavanagh's society-that I had&#xD;
rio time to write."&#xD;
"Ah! that is the reason why their carriage is not waiting&#xD;
for you. Colonel Conyers, if you will take a seat with us to&#xD;
Hardbargain, and rest for a few hours or a few da~ys as you&#xD;
'plea'~e, we shall be very glad, and we shall furnish you with&#xD;
a conveyance to White Cliffs whenever you wish to go.&#xD;
Colonel Conyers expressed himself but too happy to accept&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton's invitation, atid they all entered the old-fash-&#xD;
ioned cai~riage, and set out for Ilardbargain~ The farm was&#xD;
nine miles distant, and the road the very roughest, even of&#xD;
xnountain turnpikes. Colonel Conyers ventured to wonder&#xD;
how 'any carriage could stand it, and surmised that R-&#xD;
County must be blessed with the best wheelwrights in the&#xD;
world-to which Mrs. Clifton replied that they had the very&#xD;
best to be met with anywhere.&#xD;
It wa~ ten o'clock at night when they reached Hardbar-&#xD;
gain,~but they found the hall lighted up; fires blazing in the&#xD;
&#xD;
*&#xD;
"'9&#xD;
9r~&#xD;
&#xD;
parlor, and the dining-room, and a substantial supper waiting&#xD;
for the order of the mistress. The farm-house looked cheer-&#xD;
ful, hospitable, and inviting; and Colonel Conyers rubbed&#xD;
his hands in delight, lie remained over night. The next&#xD;
day was Christmas, and nothing but the binding engagement&#xD;
to render an account of himself to the beautiful Georgia at&#xD;
least 13y Christmas, could have forced him to White Cliffs that&#xD;
day. He accepted Mrs. Clifton's cordial invitation to come&#xD;
over often while he remained in the neighborhood. In fact,&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton had seen that Colonel Conyers was very much&#xD;
pleased with Catherine, and she felt desirous 'that he should&#xD;
have an opportunity of winning the affections of her fa site.&#xD;
Colonel Conyers took the largest advantage of Mrs. Cl ,, s&#xD;
hospitality, and not even the charms of the syren of Whi~e&#xD;
Cliffs, could wile him away from his daily evening ride over&#xD;
to Hardbargain. And so, after a few weeks-.-as\there is no&#xD;
accounting for tastes, and as the most extraordinary things&#xD;
sometimes really do happen-it turned out that' Colonel Con-&#xD;
yers actu~dly did lay his heart, hand and fortune 'at the feet&#xD;
of' th~ humble girl whom his own subordinate officer, Captain&#xD;
Clifton, had despised, and, furthermore, that he 'was rejected&#xD;
by her! Yes! gratefully, kindly, but firmly and finally re-&#xD;
jected! And full of disappointment, humiliation and sor-&#xD;
row, the gallant Colonel abruptly concluded his visit, and&#xD;
returned to town.&#xD;
"Oh, 'Catherine, my dear, if you could but have liked&#xD;
him well enough to have married him.i He is an honest,&#xD;
kind-hearted man," said Mrs. Clifton, with a sigh of regret.&#xD;
"Yes, he is a good man., Heaven bless' him with 'a good&#xD;
wife," answered Kate.&#xD;
Neither of these unworldly women once reverted to the&#xD;
advantages of rank resigned with.the rejected loyer.&#xD;
And scion Catherine had' other thoughts and occupations&#xD;
than 'those connected~ with courtship find marriage. The&#xD;
situation of her grandfather demanded all her care. For&#xD;
many months before this, the 'long and persevering efforts of-&#xD;
the patient girl had been blessed with success, and the old&#xD;
man had abandoned the use of intoxicating spirits.. But&#xD;
within the last few weeks the total disuse of the stimulant to&#xD;
which he was morbidly accustomed, had began to produce&#xD;
the most dangerous effects upon his aged and infirm fi~ame.&#xD;
Tie grew weaker and still ~4ieaker, until at length he was&#xD;
confined to his bed. And' so' h~ slowly sank and failed, a~&#xD;

~THE CURSE OP CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
weeks-weary week~-ilragged on to months. And through&#xD;
all this dreary time, da~~ and, night, Catherine faithfully&#xD;
nursed him. Many a night she sat the only watcher by his&#xD;
bedside, hourly expecting his cV3ath; and many a morning&#xD;
he revived again, so deep a hold had life upon that old, worn&#xD;
body. Scarcely ~r necessary fooa 'or rest would Catherine&#xD;
leave him, always watching, Waiting on and cheering him;&#xD;
sometimes-whenever he desired it-reading the 'Bible to&#xD;
him, singing or praying with him. In vain Mrs. Clifton,&#xD;
noticing the care-worn, toil-worn, emaciated countenance&#xD;
of the girl, besought her to take care of her own health.&#xD;
Catherine cared for nothing on earth so much as the aged&#xD;
aily fading away from her sight. And so passed 'the&#xD;
Wnter. And so opened the spring. And then his old&#xD;
disease, if it could be called a disease, took a most alarming&#xD;
turn. After ~a paroxysm more violent than ever had come&#xD;
on him before, he fell into a state of greater prostration.&#xD;
And 'the physician hastily summoned, declared that another&#xD;
such attack would be 'fatal, and that only the use of brandy&#xD;
could ward the fit off, 'and save his' life. Carl Wetzel replied&#xD;
that he felt'if he~should taste the intoxicating liquid again,&#xD;
the fatal appetite for alcohol would return upon him with&#xD;
tenfold violence for the temporary abstinence, and that it&#xD;
would totally subject him to its dominion. The doctor&#xD;
called him a fool and a fanatic, without self-control or self-&#xD;
reliance, and left him to his fate. 'When the physician had&#xD;
left the hut, the old man called his grand-daughter to his&#xD;
bedside.&#xD;
"Kate, you heard .what the doctor said ?"&#xD;
Kate nodded-her heart was too full for speech.&#xD;
"My dear child-my dear; gQod Kate !-~he says that&#xD;
unless I drink brandy I shall die. But, Kate, if I taste&#xD;
brandy again, I feel I shall live-a drunkard! Kate, I&#xD;
kncw you are wise and good beyond your years. Kate, 'I&#xD;
'have 'full faith in you! My child, I will do as' you 'decide&#xD;
for me. Darling, shall I drink or die V'&#xD;
Kate sank upon her knees by his bedside, took both his&#xD;
venerable hands and kissed 'and pressed them to her bosom,&#xD;
bowed her face over theni~. and wept in silence. 'At last,&#xD;
raising her head, she gazed earnestly, reverently, lovingly in&#xD;
the old man's face, and answered-&#xD;
"Dearest~ grandfather, do not ask me, a poor, weak, erring&#xD;
girl! Dearest grandfather, ask God !"&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
41&#xD;
&#xD;
The old man feebly raised his hand, and placed it on her&#xD;
head and blessed her, adding--.&#xD;
"I thank Thee, oh, Father! that out of the mouths of&#xD;
babes and ducklings Thou hast perfected praise !"&#xD;
The next morning, when the doctor came, he found the&#xD;
old man sinking fast, yet clinging as human nature will cling,&#xD;
to the wish for-the hope of-life.&#xD;
"Poptor, is there no other way of saving me than that&#xD;
you spoke of~"&#xD;
"None, whatever, my good friend; unless you consent to&#xD;
save yourself by taking alcohol, you must die."&#xD;
"Then I will die~ !" replied Carl Wetzel.&#xD;
And within a week from this time the old man died kand&#xD;
was buried.&#xD;
After the funeral was over, Mrs. Clifton invited and urged~&#xD;
Catherine to come and take up her permanent residence at&#xD;
Hardbargain. There were now no reasons why Catherine&#xD;
should not, and many why she should, accept this very advan~~&#xD;
tageous offer.&#xD;
Her brother Carl was about to bring home a wif&amp;amp;,. after&#xD;
which he would no longer need Catherine's~ services. And&#xD;
now that the spring had fully opened, Mrs. Clifton's health,&#xD;
as usual at that season, failed, and she really needed the&#xD;
companionship and care of our unprocessed Sister of Charity.&#xD;
And, therefore, Catherine accepted her proposal, and came&#xD;
to take possession of the room, Mrs. Clifton had fitted up&#xD;
for her adjoining her own chamber. It had once been Archer&#xD;
Clifton's room. That was of no consequence to Catherine&#xD;
now, however. You need not now be told again that the&#xD;
girl was a tri.m Christian. She had great faith-.'-.she believed&#xD;
in miracles, asserting that the days of miracles had not passed&#xD;
-could ~not pass until the days of~ God's Omnipotence and&#xD;
man's faith should be passed. When the passion of her&#xD;
heart was about to become the sin of her ~ou1, she prayed to&#xD;
God to remove the last vestige of that erring, ill-fated love-,-.&#xD;
and it was removed-gone! She could think of him; speak&#xD;
of him, without an altered pulse. She knew that he and his&#xD;
wife were soon expected at White Cliffs, and she felt tha~t she&#xD;
would meet them again without any' other emotion ~than&#xD;
pleasure. On the day of her removal to Hardbargain, 1~Irs.&#xD;
Clifton said to her-&#xD;

"Catherine! I see by the Richmond Standard, that Archer&#xD;
has resigned his post~ in the army."&#xD;
"It is not possible; madam !"&#xD;
"Yes, indeed. I was very ~uuch astonished to ~ee it."&#xD;
"What in the world could have been his motive ?"&#xD;
"I cannot even form an idea. No motive was assigned in&#xD;
the paper."&#xD;
* "And did he never mention his intention to you in any&#xD;
of his letters?"&#xD;
~' Never, Kate. But 'indeed, I have not heard from him&#xD;
for six weeks. I cannot tell the reason why he does not&#xD;
write. Perhaps his letters have been lost.-the foreign mails&#xD;
ar~s~o irregular.&#xD;
"Was he at havana when you heard from him last,&#xD;
madam ?"&#xD;
"Yes; Catherine-.-but then he spoke of a speedy return&#xD;

"At last,! lit is from              at it, saying-&#xD;
havana, Catherine, from Archer."&#xD;
She opened it, and as she read it, her face became very&#xD;
grave. And having finished, she fell into thought, and&#xD;
said~-.-&#xD;
"It is as I feared."&#xD;
"1 trust there is no bad news, madam ?" said Catherine.&#xD;

of nothing but vain desires and blighted hopes-of sorrow~&#xD;
and sickness and death'?"&#xD;
~C I knew it would be so, Catherine-that was a secret rea-&#xD;
son I had for not meddling this last' time in bringing about a&#xD;
reconciliation between Carolyn and Archer. I have known&#xD;
for two years past that she was following her mother. All&#xD;
those Gowers die early of' consumption"&#xD;
"But, madam, let us hope better things. This sea' voyage&#xD;
and residence in the South of France, may restore her."&#xD;
"Never, Catherine. And it was even' cruel in the doctors&#xD;
to send her there, to die in a foreign land, among strangers.&#xD;
They had better 'have sent her home to the scenes of her&#xD;
childhood and youth, where we could have cheered and&#xD;
nursed her. Catherine, I feel very sad."&#xD;
The tears were rolling down Kate's face. The fountain&#xD;
of consolation in her heart was almost dry-and again she&#xD;
had to lift her 'heart to ~the Divine source of all strength and&#xD;
light for new faith and hope. Little else but suffering and&#xD;
sorrow had: the girl seen since she came into the workl.~-andl&#xD;
no part h~id she filled in life but that of servant, nurse, or&#xD;
comforter. '&#xD;
The summer passed with' 'Mr~. Clifton and Catherine in&#xD;
almost uninterrupted retirement. They heard~ at long inter-&#xD;
vals, from Major Clifton and his bride, and then the news was&#xD;
various~ and? unsatisfactory. Sometimes Carolyn was better,&#xD;
and there~ woi~d 'be a talk of speedy return, and, perhaps,&#xD;
the very next letter, after a long interval, would speak of a&#xD;
season of prostration by extreme illness. And about the&#xD;
middle of the 'autumn, Mrs. Clifton received a letter from&#xD;
her son announcing their intention of wintering in Lisbon.&#xD;

The irregular ~arrivals of these bulletins were the most in-&#xD;
teresting, and nearly the only interesting events of the sum-&#xD;
mer and autumn, if we except a descent upon White ClifTh&#xD;
by Mrs. Gcorgia and her friends. The syren, after her re-&#xD;
turn from a summer tour to the fashionable watering places,&#xD;
determined to fill up the dull interim before the' commence-&#xD;
ment of. the season in town, by a visit to her "seat hi&#xD;
as she persisted in calling White Cliffs. Ac-&#xD;
cordingly, she made up a party of idle ladies and sporting&#xD;
gentlemen, and came down to spend September.&#xD;
Colonel Conycre was among the guests. He renewed his&#xD;
visits to Hardbargain, and his suit to Catherine-received a&#xD;
second rejection; and hurried off to town, under the sting oT&#xD;
mortitication as before. At the first of October, the "city riff-&#xD;
raff," as the old family servants of Clifton irreverently and&#xD;
indignantly called the' moneye4 aristocrats, returned to Rich-&#xD;
mond, whither they were, shortly followed by their beautiful&#xD;
hostess, to 'prepare for her, winter campaign. From this&#xD;
time to the middle of December, no event marked the even&#xD;
tenor of the 'life at Hardbargain. The *inmates had not&#xD;
lately heard from Major Clifton. It was near Christmas.&#xD;
In her anxiety to hear from Lisbon,, Mrs. Clifton was in the&#xD;
habit of sending to L twice a week, when the 'mail&#xD;
came in, and sitting up till a very late. hour, waiting for the&#xD;
return of the messenger.&#xD;
~One evening after' supper, Mrs. ~Clifton and Catherine sat&#xD;
each side their work-stand, before the fire, awaiting the at-&#xD;
rival of~ the'.boy who had been dispatched ~to the post-office.&#xD;
So'often had ~the lady. thue sat and waited, and been disap-&#xD;
pointed, that hope waxed very faint., ~This time; however,&#xD;
she was destined' to' have her heart gladdened'by the full'&#xD;
fruition of hope. About nine o'clock the messenger returned,&#xD;
and entered. the parlor with ~a packet of~ letters and papers.&#xD;
The boy's face was lighted up with sympathetic joy, and be&#xD;
exclaimed, as he handed the bundle-.&#xD;
"I almos' rid myself~ to death, mistress, I was so glad I&#xD;
had de letters to bring yer." -&#xD;
"You have made great haste indeed,~Neddy. Go tell&#xD;
Ilenny to~ give you. your supper," said the la~.&#xD;
"Good boy!" said Kate, pressing his little 'sooty hand as&#xD;
he passed her and went out.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton was reading ,a letter from 4rcher. It was&#xD;
written in a glad, buoyant spirit, and contained the best pos-&#xD;

~sible news. Against all hope, Carolyn's health since her&#xD;
arrival at Lisbon had steadily improved, and it was now so&#xD;
far re-established, that they were already looking forward to&#xD;
their voyag&amp;amp; at the earliest opening of spring. Carolyn had&#xD;
gained flesh and color as well as health, and strength and&#xD;
cheerfulness, and was looking far better than she had looked&#xD;
since his first meeting her again at Richmond. Mrs. Clifton&#xD;
repeated all this to Catherine, adding-&#xD;
"It is true, Kate, that none of her family who have per-&#xD;
ished by her disease ever tried a change of climate, and&#xD;
although in most cases such a change hurries the p~itient to&#xD;
the grave, yet, in some instances, it seems to work wonders&#xD;
in the way of cure; and who knows, if Carolyn is so greatly&#xD;
benefited, that she may not get over this danger, and if not&#xD;
positively cured, yet live to a good old age, and die at last&#xD;
of somethingg else, as I have heard of consumptives doing."'&#xD;
"I'm so glad !" Catherine sat with herface suffused with&#xD;
the flush, and her eyes filled with the tears of sympathizing&#xD;
joy and thanksgiving. After reading and re-reading the&#xD;
letter, and dwelling on it, and talking of it, Mrs. Clifton&#xD;
finally unfolded the paper, th~ Richmond Standard, and&#xD;
rQnning her eyes 'over its columns , suddenly exclaimed-&#xD;
"Catherine, 'When joys come they o~me not as single&#xD;
spies but in battalions'-here is excellent news of an old&#xD;
friend-listen---only two or three lines among the 'items' of&#xD;
a newspaper column, yet of what great moment to many-&#xD;
hear." And the lady read :-" At the conclusion of the&#xD;
recent treaty of peace between this government and the&#xD;
Shoshonowa Nation, among the prisoners held to ransom was&#xD;
the gallant Captain Fairfax, supposed to have falleir under&#xD;
their tomahawks, at the mase~e bear Fort Protection.&#xD;

Catherine was positively speechless with joy; only her&#xD;

felt. In th~ great,' though calm surprise and rejoicing~ over&#xD;
the event, these friends forget its singularity, until after a&#xD;

knowing perfectly well that scalping and rifling the bodies&#xD;
are the almost invariable custo~n of the savages .~ And then&#xD;
remember, Catherine, the body taken for the corpse of Cap-&#xD;

"So indeed it was said to be! I would the mj~take. had&#xD;

"Catherine, my child, I have no idea that Zuleime was&#xD;
really drowned."&#xD;
"Madam !"&#xD;
"Do you not know, Catherine, that any body drowned in that&#xD;
part of the river where the supposed signs of her suicide were&#xD;
found, must have come to light. Don t you 2know that the&#xD;
current is very rapid there, and that a ledge of rocks crosses&#xD;
the river a few yards below it, upon which her body must&#xD;
have been thrown, if she had been in the river at all? And,&#xD;
Catherine, if I have never breathed this thought before, it was&#xD;
upon account of poor Carolyn. I knew that in her weak, de-&#xD;
pressed state of mind and body, she could better bear the&#xD;
belief of Zuleime's death, than the frightful uncertainty of&#xD;
her 'fates You are discreet, Kate; you will not breathe&#xD;
this to Carolyn, or to any one, lest it should reach her ear."&#xD;
"Never! Ami. do you know, dear Mrs. Clifton, I have&#xD;
sometimes had the thought that Zuleime might yet be living-&#xD;
and I dared not indulge the hope seeretily-much less breathe&#xD;
it aloud."&#xD;
"And what. was your reason for such a supposition,&#xD;
2Catherine ?"&#xD;
"Why my thought ~was not so well founded-do logical as&#xD;
yours. I knew nothing about the peculiarities of the river.&#xD;
l~1y thought was only a vague hope, and it agitated me so&#xD;
much as to interfere with my ~racticai duties. I had to&#xD;
,banish it."&#xD;
"You are so sensitive, so sympathetic, my dear girl.&#xD;
Well, Kate, no more exciting talk to-night. We will return&#xD;
thanks to God for these glad tidings, and then retire to&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIII.&#xD;
ZULEIME.&#xD;
Among a jumbled heap of' murky building~.-KEATs.&#xD;
ZIJLEIME had been placed by Georgia under the care of a&#xD;
poor woman, the wif~ of a carver and gilder, who bad occa.-&#xD;
sionally worked for her father. And as long as the funds&#xD;
of the belle had held out, the trifling expenses of such poor&#xD;
board and lodging had been regularly paid. But when the&#xD;
syren was reduced to support her own extravagance enliroly&#xD;
by credit, founded upon the false reputation of wealth-her&#xD;
small remittances to her prot~g~, or;rather her victim, ceased.&#xD;
Zuleime was afraid to seek her, afraid to write to her-there&#xD;
was nothing she feared more than discovery, and the&#xD;
recognition of her hand-writing on the superscription of a&#xD;
letter might have led to that. It was long after the death&#xD;
of her father before she heard of it-nor then did she hear&#xD;
any of the particulars of time, prace or circumstance. The&#xD;
fact came to her knowledge irregulaTly, through the report&#xD;
of the transcendent charms and conquests of his beautiful&#xD;
young widow. A long and dangerous illness was the result&#xD;
of this sudden news. It' was some weeks after her recovery&#xD;
before the' poor people of the house, who had long despaired&#xD;
of getting anything for her board, could find it in their kind&#xD;
hearts to ask her to seek another home. And even then they&#xD;
sent a sigh after the desolate young widow-the child who&#xD;
went forth carrying in her arms another child. And how&#xD;
she lhFed during the interval between that and the period at&#xD;
which I shall again introduce her to you, 21 canijot tell.&#xD;
Sometimes a little fine needle-work came to he~ hands; some-&#xD;
times a spell of want, reaching almost to starvation; then a&#xD;
little assistance from neighbors; and a little going in debt to&#xD;
shopkeepers. And then she always lodged with' the pool'.&#xD;
And the poor seldom persecute the poor; remember that&#xD;

at the sole expense of her food, lodging, and long illness-&#xD;
and yet they had never reproached or persecuted her for un-&#xD;
paid debts-though they scarcely refrained from reproaching&#xD;
themselves for sending her awi~y.&#xD;
In a quiet, back street, mostly inhabited by very humble&#xD;
people, in the middle of the square, and fronting immediately&#xD;
upon the battered pavement, stood an old two-story brick&#xD;
house, occupied by a poor ~cabinet-maker and old furniture&#xD;
dealer. The lower front room was used as the ware-room,&#xD;
and crowded and piled up with every description of misera-&#xD;
bly dilapidated household furniture, apparently good for&#xD;
nothing else under the s~in but kindling wood, and scarcely&#xD;
worth splitting up for that. Old worm-eaten; carved ma-&#xD;
hogany'bureaus and bedsteads; tables without legs or leaves~&#xD;
chairs without backs; cradles without bottoms or rockers:&#xD;
clocks wanting faces; beaufets wanting doors ; sofas minus&#xD;
arms; smoky pictures without frames; and tarnished frames&#xD;
without pictures; worm-eaten cabinets, and mildewed look&#xD;
ing-glasses; broken pots, pans and kettles; and mismatchedl&#xD;
crockery-ware in any quantity.&#xD;
Reader, I do not wish to give you an inventory of an old&#xD;
furniture-shop, but merely some idea of the inextricable conA&#xD;
fusion in which this heterogeneous mass of worn-out, broken,&#xD;
worm-eaten, mildewed, fly-stained, dust-clothed, cobweb-.'&#xD;
veiled items, were piled upfrom.floor to ceiling. itwouldinake&#xD;
your heart and head ache 'with wondering what. sort of a liv-&#xD;
ing could be picked out from so xnuch dirt, disorder and&#xD;
decay-and who on earth could be the patrons of the establish-&#xD;
ment. You would unconsciously gather close about you&#xD;
your most worthless dress in passing through the 'chop, and&#xD;
look up in involuntary dread of ~ broken head or limbs, by&#xD;
the fall of some of those dilapidated, ill-balanced, old chairs&#xD;
and tables.&#xD;
The family of the chair-maker consisted of himself, his&#xD;
wife, and two daughters. They were Germans, with the&#xD;
usual talent of that race for money-getting and money-keep-&#xD;
ing. And the man made at least a hundred per cent. on&#xD;
every old, rickety, worm-eaten bureau or table that, mended&#xD;
and varnished, left his shop. They added to their income,&#xD;
by letting the rooms of their kouse, and occasionally by&#xD;
taking a profitable boarder.&#xD;
It was in the early part of the same autumn which found&#xD;
her sister Carolyn in Lisbon.~-and Mrs. Clifton and Cathe-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OP CLIFTON.             49&#xD;
rmne alone at Llardbargain, that Zuleime became a tenant of&#xD;
the German cabinet-maker. She occupied the back roem,&#xD;
on the second floor; the two daughters of the family using&#xD;
the front room as a sleeping apartment. She had the use of&#xD;
the street passage door, and so reached her room without&#xD;
passing through the shop or any part of the house occu-&#xD;
pied by the family or their boarders. The refinement in&#xD;
which she had been born and bred, was not lost amid her&#xD;
bitter poverty. It constrained her to seek privacy of life at&#xD;
least. She supported herself and child, just now, by doing&#xD;
fine needle-work for some ladies on a transient visit to the&#xD;
city. But the work was precarious, and the supply might&#xD;
be cut off at any moment. Her expenses were small, how-&#xD;
ever, and her economy wonderful. Her neat, but poorly&#xD;
furnished room, cost her but ten shillings a month; a bushel&#xD;
of meal and1 a pint of salt, five shillings; milk for the child,&#xD;
two shillings; fuel,~eight shillings; washing, three shillings;&#xD;
candle-light, two shillings; and the attendance of a boy to&#xD;
bring water and cut wood, Three shillings-making the sum&#xD;
total of her monthly expenses only one pound, fourteen shil-&#xD;
lings, or little more than six dollars. Her only food was&#xD;
mush or corn-cakes prepared from the n:~al. She could not&#xD;
have kept u~ very long under this regimen; indeed, although&#xD;
she knew it not, she was slowly dying of a disease as com-&#xD;
mon as lingering, and as universally ignored as that of a&#xD;
broken heart-namely, nutrition or slow starvation. Her&#xD;
German hostess, kind-hearted, notwithstanding her money&#xD;
grasping propensities, often sent hera bowl of "noodle soup,"&#xD;
with a little plate of "sour-krout," and a tumbler of&#xD;
schnapps, or some such combination of German luxuries.&#xD;
But Zuleime, who managed to exist upon coarse food, could&#xD;
not endure gross food, and she would turn away from&#xD;
such, scarcely able to conceal the sickness the very odor so&#xD;
appetizing to a Dutch stomach, excited in hers. Still her&#xD;
refusal of the viands was couched in words so gentle and&#xD;
grateful, as never to offend her landlady. Some of my&#xD;
readers may wonder why Zuleime did not do her washing,&#xD;
water-drawing, etc., with her c~wn handy, and take the money&#xD;
paid for having those things done, and buy better food ~&#xD;
Because, for one reason, she had not the requisite physical&#xD;
strength or skill-and besides, perhaps, she shrank from the&#xD;
exposure necessarily incurred in these labors. She had not in&#xD;
these two years, forgotten the delicacy and refine~nent in which&#xD;

she had been nurtured~ On the contrary, everything in) her&#xD;
appearance and manners, betrayed the gentle-woman. She&#xD;
had but one dress in the worl4-all the others had been cut&#xD;
up to make clothes for her little girl. Her sole gown was&#xD;
black bombazine, which she had worn daily for nearly two&#xD;
years-yet so good was its original quality, and so well had&#xD;
it been preserved, that it was now neither rusty nor thread-&#xD;
bare. It was shaken out and hung up every night, and well&#xD;
brushed and spunged every week. This dress, with the&#xD;
little inside 'kerchief of linen, was always neat and lady-like.&#xD;
Zuleinfe's fine needle-work gave out-as she knew it would-&#xD;
and she found herself, without employment, or funds. It was&#xD;
then that Bertha and Wilhelmina Erhmie~itraut, the daugh-&#xD;
ters of her landlord, told her of a German clothier on Main&#xD;
street, who had advertised for a number of needle-women to&#xD;
make vests. Zuleime confessed her total igi~orance of that&#xD;
branch of needle work. But the kind German girls promised&#xD;
that if she would procure* the work, they would give her&#xD;
some instructions how it shouldie done. Zukime gratefully&#xD;
accepted their offer, and prepared to set out on her long&#xD;
walk by donning the little black bonnet and shawl, as neat&#xD;
and as well preserved as her dress had been. She could not&#xD;
father tax the kindness of her landlord's family by leaving&#xD;
her child in their care, she, had been obliged to put the little&#xD;
one to sleep, and lock it up in her room, only leaving her&#xD;
key with her landlady-" in case anything should happen"&#xD;
while she was gone. It was a long, weary tramp to Main&#xD;
street, where the clothier's store was situated. When she&#xD;
entered the show-shop and made her business kno~p, she was&#xD;
directed into a back room, where a man, behind a long table,&#xD;
was engaged in cutting out garments-and many bundles of&#xD;
cut out but unmade clothes, tied around with skeins of thread,&#xD;
lay piled up at one end. Zuleime walked .up to this table.&#xD;
The foreman, as he appeared to be, laid down Jils shears and&#xD;
looked up, saying deferentially-&#xD;
"What did you wish to look at, madam? Mr. Schneider,&#xD;
attend this lady."&#xD;
"You are in error. I do not wish to look at your wares.&#xD;
You advertised work to give out; \can I have some ?"&#xD;
The tailor looked at her again. He saw, from her gentle&#xD;
manners and appearance, that she was a lady, guessed from&#xD;
her dress that she was a widow, and knew by her errand that&#xD;
she was self-dependent, unprotected; so there excited no&#xD;
&#xD;
earthly reason why a coarse~minded, craven-hearted man,&#xD;
who spent~ his whole days in smirking, cringing, deprecating&#xD;
and deferring to others, should not refresh his soul by a little&#xD;
impertinence and insolence to so safe a subject as a poor&#xD;
lady.&#xD;
"Did you ever make vests ?" he asked, in a short, cuft,&#xD;
insolent manner.&#xD;
"No," answered Zuleime, "but I sew very neatly-.-.un~.&#xD;
usually neatly, my patrons say-and as you cut and baste&#xD;
the work, very Little instruction would enable me to make&#xD;
them very nicely."&#xD;
"I shan't trust you! I have had quite enough in my time&#xD;
of giving out work to people who know nothing about the&#xD;
business.~,&#xD;
It was not the words so much as the insulting manner of&#xD;
the man, that shocked the gentle-hearted woman, and she&#xD;
turned and left the shop, ready to sink, not so much under&#xD;
disappointment, though she kneW not where to turn for work&#xD;
or money or food-but under the deeply humiliating sense&#xD;
of the rudeness and vulgarity to which she was forced to ex~~&#xD;
pose herself in. this bitter struggle through the world. She&#xD;
walked slowly, thoughtfully, sadly away from the shop, till&#xD;
the sudden thought of her chiId's~ awakening, electrified her,&#xD;
and she hurried on until she reached home. She obtained&#xD;
her key from the landlady, in the basement, and entered the&#xD;
passage. It was then that she heard a very sweet, gentle&#xD;
voice, apparently near her room door, saying-&#xD;
"Don't cry, baby! poor baby, don't cry! mother will come&#xD;
by-and-by! Deqr pretty baby, don't cry! I'll bring you&#xD;
all my playthings, and a little dog, when I can get in."&#xD;
And then, in the pause of the child's wails and broken&#xD;
talk, and baby plaints, she ran up stairs at once,, and there,&#xD;
kneeling befoNre her door, and talking thi~ough the key-hole,&#xD;
was a sweet little dark haired girl of about five years old,&#xD;
and dressed in deep mourning. Her hat of the finest Leg-&#xD;
horn straw, the richness of the black ribbon that bound it--&#xD;
the fineness of the bh~ck bombazine frock and the linen ea~-&#xD;
bric tucker, the delicate shoes and stockings-the gentle, re-&#xD;
fined manner, all bespoke a child of a different rank from&#xD;
those seen in that neighborhood, and especially in that house.&#xD;
The child' got up and stood aside when she saw the lady come&#xD;
with the key to unlock the door. When Zuleime had en~&#xD;
tered her room, and lifted the babe to her lap, ~he called the&#xD;

little girl up .to her side. She was a lovely child indeed,,&#xD;
with fair skin and delicate features-jet-black hair, eye-&#xD;
brows and eye-lashes, and large, mournful, dayk gray eyes.&#xD;
"You are a dear little girl. What is your name 'P' asked&#xD;
Zuleime, pulling her around her waist caressingly.&#xD;

gave it to me when father died. Mother wears one, too.&#xD;
You've got a black dress on, too! Is your father dead '?"&#xD;

she wouldn't! Is the baby's father dead, too l"&#xD;
"Yes-yes, love-the baby's father is dead, too !"&#xD;

the bed. And afterwards he went to sleep. An~l they said&#xD;
he was dead.. Was that the way with the baby's father ~"&#xD;
"I don't want to talk about it, dear Ida. Tell me of your&#xD;
mother. What does she play on-the organ V'&#xD;
"No! I don't know. Yes I do, too !-the stage. Look&#xD;
at my nice new hat. It used to have, a wreath of red roses&#xD;
round it. But when father died, mother took it off and pjut&#xD;
l~his black ribbon there. Mother wears roses 'on her head,&#xD;
though. 'At night, I mean. All day long she wears black,&#xD;
and looks so pale and weeps. But at night, she puts beauti-&#xD;
ful flowers in her hair, and sometimes gold and fine feathers-&#xD;
and she has such 'sweet long curls and rosy cheeks~-and such&#xD;
beautiful dresses. And father used to wear beautiful clothes&#xD;
at night, red and gold, and feathers. I do want to~ see father&#xD;
so much. I wish they'd bring him back. Do you think it&#xD;
&#xD;
will be long before I see him ?" asked the child, as the large&#xD;
tears rolled down her cheeks.&#xD;
"Perhaps not, my love. Is your mother an actress, then ?"&#xD;
"Yes, that is what she is. Don't cry, now! It gives me&#xD;
a pain in my bosom. Please don't cry; if you don't, I won't,"&#xD;
said the child, wiping her eyes. Then suddenly she exclaimed,&#xD;
"Oh! I forgot, I promised to bring the baby my playthings&#xD;
and my curly dog ;" and so Saying, the child ran away and&#xD;
scampered down stairs.&#xD;
Zuleinie looked in vain for her return, and, finally con-&#xD;
cluded that her mother had detained her. But if the child&#xD;
did not come, somebody else did. Wilhelmina entered, and.&#xD;
kindly inquired after her lodger's success in seeking work.&#xD;
When she learned her failure, she begged Zuleime not to be&#xD;
trouble, for that there was work in the house for her if she&#xD;
would take it. That the new boarder, Mrs. Knight, the lead-&#xD;
ing lady of the Richmond Theatre, wanted assistance in&#xD;
making up some dresses, that were to be ready in a few days.&#xD;
That she, Wilhelmina, had recommended their lodger, and&#xD;
if the young lady phased, she would conduct her down and&#xD;
introduce her to Mrs. Knight. Zuleinie thanked the 1~ind-&#xD;
hearted girl, and prepared to accompany her-..--sensible amid&#xD;
all her other emotions of a rustic's curiosity to see a really&#xD;
living actress, for she had never in her life seen one off the&#xD;
boards. She followed Wilhelmina down the stairs into the&#xD;
passage.. Near the foot of the stairs was a door leading into&#xD;
the first floor back room. At this door Wilhelmina rapped.&#xD;
It was opened by Ida, who, as soon as she saw Zuleime, ex-&#xD;
claimed-&#xD;
"Oh! it's you! Come in. Mother! here is the baby's&#xD;
mother !"&#xD;
'It is I, Mrs. Knight, with the person I spoke of. May&#xD;
come in 'P' inquired Wilhelmina.&#xD;
"Assuredly. Do so," replied the sweetest, deepest voice&#xD;
Zuleime thought she had ever heard. And they entered the&#xD;
room. Willielmina introduced Mrs. Fairfax; and withdrew.&#xD;
The apartment in which Zuleime found herself, was the best&#xD;
furnished roomh in. the 'h6use-decidedly-having a good warm,&#xD;
hued carpet on the flOQr, crimson stuff curtains at the only&#xD;
back window, 'a grate with a coal fire, a four-post bedstead,&#xD;
with tester, net valance and a white counterpane, a&#xD;
btireau with tall dressing-glass, and wash-stand, with china&#xD;
toilet service. 2But it was in a state of confusion only less&#xD;

than that of the adjoining shop. Trunks, boxes, and band&#xD;
boxes of all sizes, forms and colors, some corded and piled&#xD;
up one above the other, and some open and boiling up and&#xD;
over with all sorts of finery and tinsel, satins, silks and vel..&#xD;
yets, feathers, flowers and fustian, which also trailed upon&#xD;
the carpet, and* strewed the chairs. An oil painting, in a&#xD;
large heavy gilt frame, leaned with its face against the wall.&#xD;
On the bed, a black mantle ~nd bonnet, with a widow's veil,&#xD;
lay side, by side with a gorgeous s'~arl'et velvet train, embroi&#xD;
dered with gold, an imitation ermine robe, a crown of gilt&#xD;
and paste, a plume of feathers, and great bunches of sham&#xD;
pearls. Qn a low trunk, in the. midst of this sad chaos of&#xD;
poverty and glitter, mummery and mourning, sat one who&#xD;
immediately drew and fixed Zuleime's attention. A tall,&#xD;
noble looking woman, of perhaps thirty years of age, clothed&#xD;
in deep, mourning, with her heavy black hair banded around&#xD;
her forehead, and temples, and shading a countenance dark&#xD;
and cavernous , with its large hollow eyes and hollow cheeks,&#xD;
but majestic with power, earI~estness and truth, and beautiful&#xD;
with those grand, mournful eyes,. whose mesmeric spell was&#xD;
felt by Zuleime, on whom they were now brought to bear.&#xD;
"Take a seat, Mrs. Fairfax. You find me here in great&#xD;
confusion, because I hwve but just arrived, and have had to~&#xD;
unpack and look over all these trunks, to select and prepare&#xD;
no less than four costumes for the evening," said the same&#xD;
rich, full, ~deep tones, as their owner cleared a chair of&#xD;
spangled' robes and plumes, and offered it to her visitoi~.&#xD;
"Mother is going to wear this dress this evening-isn't it&#xD;
pretty ?" said Ida, eJimbing upon the fQot of the bed.&#xD;
Zuleime turned her~ eyes with childish interest towards the&#xD;
robes; and Mrs. Knight, observing her look of curiosity,&#xD;
said-'&#xD;
"They form a portion of the Queen I~atherine costume.&#xD;
They ar~ going to bring out Henry VIII., this e~rening."&#xD;
Zuleime glanced from the costume to the haggard, but&#xD;
nobl&amp;amp;looking woman, and thought that she might represent&#xD;
the unhappy Queen very well, as far as personal appearance&#xD;
would go, but instead of expressing this opinion, she said-&#xD;
"The young German girl told me that you wanted some&#xD;
assistance in needle-work. I shall be glad to help you."&#xD;
~I~h'e dark, mournful' eyes rose slowly, and grew still, look..&#xD;
in~ at'the young widow, in whom they now began to recog-&#xD;
*iize that most piteous of all beii2gs-a reduced lady.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
"Sit down-pray sit down," she said, to Zuleime, who still&#xD;
remained standing.&#xD;
Zuleime took the vacant chair.&#xD;
"Would you. object, Mrs. Fairfax, to sitting with me While&#xD;
you sew? There are alterations to be made in these four&#xD;
Queen Katherine dresses, in which you would require my&#xD;
advice."&#xD;
Zuleime hesitated, and then answered-&#xD;
"I should not like to leave my little child alone, madam."&#xD;
"Let me !-let me !-let me go up and stay with the baby!"&#xD;
eagerly interrupted Ida, jumping down from the bed, and&#xD;
running up and seizing the hand of her mother.&#xD;
The dark eyes sank fondly on the little one, and the rich&#xD;
voice-richer now with maternal love, replied-&#xD;
"Certainly you may go, if the lady will permit you to do&#xD;
so."&#xD;
Zuleime hesitated again, then said-&#xD;
"'shank you. I shall be very glad. Let me go up first,&#xD;
and make the fire safe." And ~he left the room, followed by&#xD;
Ida, who ran back first, to throw l~er arms around her mo-&#xD;
ther's neck, and kiss her "~good-bye."&#xD;
When Zuleime reached her room, she placed the blower&#xD;
before the grate, for safety-hid away all implements with&#xD;
which the children might harm themselves, and leaving the&#xD;
little ones at play upon the rag target, returned below stairs,&#xD;
and went to work. Her new occupation was indeed of an&#xD;
odd and miscellaneous description-ripping off gold lace,&#xD;
and sewing in its place imitation sable; trimming buskins,&#xD;
and lastly, making up an ancient coiffure, all under the direc-&#xD;
tion of the shadowy-faced woman, who, all this time, sat upon&#xD;
the trunk, with a tattered play-book on her knee, studying&#xD;
her part.&#xD;
Zuleime spoke of Ida-~her beauty, her charming manner.&#xD;
"Is she? Do you find her so? I thought that might be&#xD;
only my partiality. Poor little one! She is a great comfort&#xD;
and a great. sorrow to me, if you can understand such a&#xD;
paradox."&#xD;
"Yes, I can understand it," said Zuleime.&#xD;
"II have to leave her all t~he forenoon, for the purpose of&#xD;
attending the rehearsals, and then, before itis time for her t~&#xD;
go to bed, Ihave tQ leave her, alone, and go tQ the theatre, an!i&#xD;

out. Worse than that, all day and night, while away from&#xD;
her, is the dread of her getting in the street, and into evil&#xD;
company." And the eyes of the woifian assumed an anxious,&#xD;
haggard, querulous look; as she dropped them upon her book.&#xD;
"Give your little girl into my care. I am never absent&#xD;
from home except early~ in the morning-as to-day-and at&#xD;
that hour you are here."&#xD;
The dark eyes flew up and fastened themselves upon the&#xD;
face of Zuleime, and the deep voice inquired-&#xD;
"Would you really take charge of her for me ~ Oh, it&#xD;
is too much for you, and too good in you~. I don't under-&#xD;
stand it."&#xD;
"Indeed I shall be very glad to do so. The presence of&#xD;
a lovely child is a great pleasure to me. Leave Ida with me&#xD;
this evening while you are gone, and I will put her to bed&#xD;
when the time comes."&#xD;
"For this evening 'I will gratefully accept your kindness,&#xD;
but you may find her more inconvenient than you anticipate,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Knight. And then she dropped her eyes again&#xD;
upon her book, and Zuleime went on silently with her sewing.&#xD;
About sunset the work was nearly completed, and the cos-&#xD;
tume, with the exception of the coiffure, upon which Zuleime&#xD;
was still engaged, was packed in band-boxes, to be conveyed&#xD;
to the theatre. Then Mrs. Knight rang a little hand bell,&#xD;
and when it was answered by the entrance of Bertha Erh-&#xD;
inientraut, she said,..-" Please send me a lad to carry these&#xD;
boxes for me, and ask your mother to make me a very strong&#xD;
cup of coffee."&#xD;
Bertha disappeared, and Mrs. Knight put on her bonnet&#xD;
and shawl. And soon a ragged boy appeared at ~the door,&#xD;
who agreed to carry the boxes for a sixpence. Mrs. Knight&#xD;
loaded and dispatched him at the same moment that Bertha&#xD;
re-appeared with a huge cup of strong coffee, which she took&#xD;
and drank off, standing. Then, ~s she handed back the empty&#xD;
cup ~o the German girl, and receivedd from Zuleime the&#xD;
finished coiffure pinned up in a paper, she said-&#xD;
"That cup of coffee will give me strength to go through&#xD;
my heavy part to-night, but will leave me at its close more&#xD;
exhausted than ever; thus I discount future health and life&#xD;
for present bread." And so she went off, her eyes gleaming&#xD;
under the excitement of a stimulant narcotic, as fatal, if not&#xD;
as disreputable, as opium or alcohol. Zuleime went up to&#xD;
her own room, andprepared the frugal supper for herself and&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
the two children, that were still playing on the carpet. She&#xD;
got a double portion of milk from the German people, on ac-&#xD;
count of her little guest, Ida declaring that she liked milk&#xD;
with corn cake crumbled in it better than anything, it was so&#xD;
sweet. And then when the babe was undressed and put to&#xD;
bed, the little girl's eyes waxed heavy and dim, and Zuleime&#xD;
took her down stairs into her mother's room, and disrobed&#xD;
and washed and prepared her for bed. And when the child&#xD;
was about to kiss her friend and spring into bed, Zuleime&#xD;
said-&#xD;
"Stop, Ida. Don't you say your prayers ~"&#xD;
"But don't you wish to ~"&#xD;
"Oh, yes, ma'am," said the child, and running back, she&#xD;
kneeled down at Zuleime's knees, and placed her little hands&#xD;
together and looked up for instruction.&#xD;
Zuleime thought the shortest, simplest infant's prayer she&#xD;
knew of was the best, because readily understoQd and easily&#xD;
remembered. And so she took the little one's folded hands&#xD;
between her own, and bade her repeat after her-&#xD;
Now I lay me down to sleep,&#xD;
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.&#xD;
If I should die before I wake,&#xD;
I pray the Lord my soul to take.~d&#xD;
"That is a sweet little verse. What is my soul P' asked&#xD;
the child.&#xD;
Zuleime hesitated, puzzled for an answer; then she said&#xD;
for want of a better-&#xD;
"It is what you think with, and wonder with, and what&#xD;
you are sorry or glad with, and what will live forever."&#xD;
"I love you with it then. Good-night, good, pretty lady."&#xD;
"Good-night, sweet child." And Zuleime laid her in the&#xD;
bed, and kissed her fair eyelids down to slumber.&#xD;

THE CURSE 013' CLIFTN.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
THE CATASTROPHE.&#xD;
To die mid flame and smoke !-HALLEOK&#xD;
HEAVEN knows that it is now difficult enough for a poor&#xD;
woman to make a living. But in the' days when Zuleirne&#xD;
lived ai~d suffered, it was even more so. It was especially&#xD;
hard in Virginia, where, owing to the prevalexice of the law&#xD;
of entail, the rich were very rich, and the poor very poor.&#xD;
Where, besides, ladies 1~ook pride in their domestic and in-&#xD;
dustrious habits, the favorite and most inveterate of whieh&#xD;
was that of doing their own sewing, forgetful of 'the poor&#xD;
widow and orphan, who might be suffering for the want of&#xD;
the work. It was for such reasons that Zuleime found little&#xD;
or no employment-at most of the houses where she applied&#xD;
she was told that-" We never give out needle-work," or&#xD;
th4, "The ladies of the house 1do all the family sewing."&#xD;
All very well,, in 'moderation. Industry is a praiseworthy&#xD;
habit, when it does. not compromise justice and mercy-when&#xD;
it. does not hinder us to "live and let live." Let us be&#xD;
diligent in our several callings; but for Heaven's sake, if&#xD;
we can possibly afford it, let us never refuse to give work to&#xD;
those who need, or who ask it of us. They may be suffering&#xD;
for it, they may be starving for it, they may be dying for it,&#xD;
as Zuleinie was. They may be driven to vice, to crime, for&#xD;
the want of~it, as Zuleime was not, thank Heaven. Reader,&#xD;
this portion of my story at least is no fiction. Nor was&#xD;
Zuleime's case then a solitary one. Nor would it be such&#xD;
now. There are many poor women, in every 'city, who have&#xD;
not work enough to earn their necessary food and fuel. And&#xD;
this is one of the causes :-There are hundreds of ladies, of&#xD;
the middle classes of society, who work themselves nearly to&#xD;
death, and really shorten their 'lives, by sewing for their&#xD;
large families, in order to save money to lay out in dress for&#xD;
themselves and children, more genteel than needful; or in&#xD;
&#xD;
I furniture, which they do not live very long to enjoy. And&#xD;
all this time there are hundreds of poor women around them&#xD;
suffering for a part of this very work with which they are&#xD;
killing themselves. Yes, hundreds who die annually of in-&#xD;
nutrition-a slow, cruelly slow starvation, prolonged from&#xD;
month to month, or from year to year, according to their&#xD;
relative strength of constitution. I know it. For I have&#xD;
lived among them, and seen for myself, and not another. The&#xD;
doctors call the want, of which they die, consumption-I&#xD;
think it is rather non-consumption. Znleime sank deeper&#xD;
and deeper into penury. As autumn advanced into winter,&#xD;
and as her necessities increased, her ability to supply them&#xD;
decreased. Her poverty began to betray itself sadly in her&#xD;
personal appearance. Her face was thin an~I wan, with great,.&#xD;
bright, hungry looking eyes-her hands wasted to semi-&#xD;
transparency. Her only gown, her black bonibazine, was&#xD;
rusty and threadbare, and embossed with darns-her shoes&#xD;
were so bad as to look scarcely decent. And amid all her&#xD;
other troubles, there was room for humiliated feelings upon&#xD;
eveti this account. The present was wretched-the futurO&#xD;
hopeless. She had heard of people perishing from cold and&#xD;
hunger, and to such an cud she thought her life seemed&#xD;
tending. Yet miserable as was the condition of. Zuleiine,&#xD;
there were many then, are many. now, in much worse situa-&#xD;
tions. She at least was starving in a tolerably clean room,&#xD;
in privacy and in peace. Far happier than some who perish&#xD;
in the midst of vice and filth and squalor. Yes, reader,&#xD;
there are such things; they do exist in my neighborhood,&#xD;
and yours, and it is just as well that 'they should sometin~es&#xD;
be remembered. Zuleime was dying of want. And di~I the&#xD;
people of the house know nothing of this ~ Yes, they knew&#xD;
something of it, and her German landlord trembled for his&#xD;
rent, his wife wished that they had never seen the poor thing,&#xD;
and the two girls pitied her very deeply. And Mrs. Knight&#xD;
saw it all, and suffered in sympathy, and gave the poor,&#xD;
dying girl, all the work she had to 'give, and paid her for&#xD;
doing it as liberally as she could afford. But Mrs. Knight&#xD;
was not able, from heir scanty salary, to keep up her expen-&#xD;
sive, professional wardrobe, and support two families besides.&#xD;
The greater part of the money Zuleime made, by sewing for&#xD;
the poor actress, was paid for rent, to keep the roof over 'her&#xD;
head that bitter weather, and to supply the 'daily- two-pence&#xD;
worth of milk for the' child. If a few pence were left 'over,&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIF1~ON.&#xD;
&#xD;
they were spent in cheap pilot bread, sparingly eaten by her-&#xD;
self. For weeks together she had no fire, no fuel, but would&#xD;
manage to keep her child warm l~y seating her in the middle&#xD;
of the bed, well wrapped up. By the side of the head of the&#xD;
bedstead, and looking to the south, was the only back win-.&#xD;
dow of her room. When she had work, she would sit by&#xD;
this window and sew, while her child sat wrapped up in the&#xD;
bed. Whei~ she had no work, she would still sit there and&#xD;
rock her child upon her bosom, singing to her all the while.&#xD;
Unearthly and spiritual was the wan, moonlight face, with&#xD;
its large, luminous eyes-unearthly and spiritual was the&#xD;
voice in which she sang her child to rest, as she sat by the&#xD;
south window. She found room in her burdened heart to&#xD;
love that sunny window, with its glimpses of a river land-.&#xD;
scap~, with waterfalls and hills and forests, and nearer, lying&#xD;
between her and the water, the pleasure-grounds arour~d a&#xD;
fair mansion of white freestone, that fronted on the ri4rer.&#xD;
That fine place took in nearly a whole square, and was sepa-&#xD;
rated from this poor house and lot, first, by a broad, back&#xD;
alley, then a tall brick wall, with capacious stables and&#xD;
coach-houses, then the garden, with terraces and conserva-&#xD;
tory, and so up to the venetian back piazza of the mansion.&#xD;
Every day, and all day long through the glowing autumn&#xD;
weather, she had sat and feasted her eyes and mind upon&#xD;
these pleasure-grounds, with their gorgeous flowers and mag-&#xD;
nillcent trees, and the palace-home in the midst, a picture of&#xD;
beauty and glory, telling besides of plenty, elegance, refine-&#xD;
ment, leisure, artistic taste, intellectual pursuits, family&#xD;
union, domestic happiness. Many a time, when going out to&#xD;
look for work, she had walked quite around the square 'to&#xD;
get in front of the mansion, and satisfy her soul with the,&#xD;
architectural beauty and elegance of the edifice, as it stood&#xD;
elevated by a flight of terraces far above the street, and&#xD;
commanding for many miles the mighty course of the river.&#xD;
'Often in the autumn weather, had she walked under this&#xD;
southern wall, and even in the midst of her deep distresses,&#xD;
looked up in childish longing at the splendid autumnal flowers,&#xD;
trailing luxuriantly over the iron railing. Why did this&#xD;
place i~iterest her so? Not because it ~vas a palace-home, in&#xD;
such strong contrast to her own poor dwelling-not because&#xD;
she passed it almost every day-not because its magnificent&#xD;
grounds were ever before her sight from her own poor room.&#xD;
,Ah, no! But because there was a rural character, and a&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
fine, old, ancestral look about the place, that reminded her&#xD;
of tier dear, lost home. Everything connected with the pre-&#xD;
~pises interested her, even that capacious family carriage,&#xD;
with its round bodied, gray coach horses, and its fat coach-&#xD;
man, which appeared every afternoon at a certain hour to&#xD;
take the family out to drive. She did not care to inquire&#xD;
who lived there. One day, when walking in front of the&#xD;
- house on the other street, she had seen a lady in deep mourn-&#xD;
ing come out and get in the carriage. She had time to see&#xD;
that the lady appeared bowed in grief, but possessed so sweet&#xD;
and benevolent a face, that she was encouraged to call and&#xD;
ask for work. So the next day she entered the beautiful&#xD;
grounds, ~nd ascended the stone steps~that ledAlight by flight&#xD;
up the rising terraces until sEe reached the Grecian portico&#xD;
and rang the bell. The door was opened by a man servant,&#xD;
to whom she communicated her business. He called a wait-&#xD;
ing-woman, who came, and after hearing what the viSitor&#xD;
wanted, explained civilly enough that all their needle-work&#xD;
was done by a young person, who lived companion to her&#xD;
mistress, who was too infirm to see strangers. Zuleime&#xD;
never tried there again. But the sweet, sorrowful face of&#xD;
the lady haunted her, and she gazed from her poor window&#xD;
upon the magnificent pleasure-grounds with more of interest&#xD;
than ever.&#xD;
Truly the world is "full of paper walls." How little Zu-&#xD;
leime surmised that the mourner in the palace sorrowedvover&#xD;
the very same bereavement that had laid her own life waste-&#xD;
that the fair-haired, tender-eyed lady, whose grief-worn coun-&#xD;
tenance haunted her so, was the mother of her lost Frank;&#xD;
that the proud mansion house, in the midst of its pleasure-&#xD;
grounds, was the rightful inheritance of the poor babe that&#xD;
rested on her wasted bosom.'&#xD;
how little did the childless and desolate recluse of the&#xD;
palace guess that her lost son's widow sat pining, starving'&#xD;
so near her! The world is full of paper walls, but, ~fate&#xD;
makes them firmer, stronger, more indestructible than ada-&#xD;
mant.&#xD;
Upon that very sai~ie December night that found Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton and Catherine rejoicing over the good news they had&#xD;
heard from their friends, upon that very night Zuleirne sat&#xD;
shivering in her room, without fire, food or light. She had&#xD;
given her child its cup of milk, and thanked Heaven that&#xD;
she had it to give, though she herself went hungry. And&#xD;

she had wrapped the babe in her shawl, and sat by the win-&#xD;
dow, singing and rocking her, to sleep. The room was in-&#xD;
tensely cold, she was chilled to the heart, her feet were numb,&#xD;
and almost lifeless. The only warmth in her body seemed&#xD;
to be the bosom at which the child was pressed. The snow&#xD;
was falling fast without, but even through its flakes she saw&#xD;
the lighted windows of the mansion-house glowing through&#xD;
the crimson curtains, and streaming redly across the snow-&#xD;
clad ground. And she sat and thought of the comforts&#xD;
within that parlor. While she sat there thinking, there came&#xD;
a gentle knock at her door.&#xD;
"Who is there ?" inquired Zuleime.&#xD;
"It is I, Mrs. Fairfax," replied the voice of the actress.&#xD;
"Come in, Mrs. Knight."&#xD;
The actress entered, saying, with a little pardonable tact-&#xD;
"Oh, you are putting your child to sleep in the dark. It&#xD;
is singular some little ones never will go to sleep where there&#xD;
is a light burning. Is she asleep ?"&#xD;
"Yes," replied Zuleime.&#xD;
"Then please put her in bed, my dear, and come down&#xD;
stairs with me. I have something to talk to you about." -&#xD;
Zuleime laid her little girl in bed, and tottering with4 weak-&#xD;
ness, from her long fast and the cold, accompanied the actress&#xD;
down stairs.&#xD;
Mrs. Knight opened her own loom, and revealed a warm.&#xD;
coal~re burning in the grate, and a little supper-table set&#xD;
out,'4'with coffee, French rolls, nice butter, and stewed oysters9&#xD;
She set the cushioned rocking-chair for Zuleime, between&#xD;
the fire and the table, and pushed her gently into the seat,&#xD;
saying-&#xD;
"I have holiday to-night, and for a week from to-night,&#xD;
because the opera troupe are here. And so Ii thought I&#xD;
would just celebrate its commencement by a supper and a&#xD;
ball for two !" And she placed before her visitor a plate of&#xD;
oysters and a cup of coffee. When the little supper was&#xD;
fairly commenced, Mrs. Knight said, "I did not send for you,&#xD;
only t~ take coffee with me-I wished to speak to you on a&#xD;
matter of business. I hare been wishing some time to do so,&#xD;
but scarcely knew how to do it without wounding or offend-&#xD;
ing you." She paused.&#xD;
are you so considerate? Yet you need not fear-&#xD;
I know you could not think of anything to say which would-.&#xD;
would hurt me."&#xD;
&#xD;
"At least, I only mean your good, and if I err, you will&#xD;
forgive me."&#xD;
"Gentle friend! I am used to all the hardness and vul-&#xD;
garity- against which a woman has to break her heart and&#xD;
spirit, in struggling through the rough world. Now think&#xD;
of that. And think whether I can be hurt by anything your&#xD;
kind heart impels you to say. No, I shall be very grate-&#xD;
ful !"&#xD;
"Well, this is it, then, my dear. I have not been able to&#xD;
avoid seeing your fruitless efforts to maintain yourself and&#xD;
child, for the last three months. I fear you have scarcely&#xD;
made five shillings a week."&#xD;
"I have not made that for the last month."&#xD;
"And there seems to be no chance of doing bettor-with&#xD;
your needle, I mean."&#xD;
Ah, no, ~&#xD;
"And your situation is getting worse every day. Poor&#xD;
child! your very shoes are almost gone-there-forgive me-&#xD;
I have spoken rudely."&#xD;
"No, no-you have spoken the truth in love. Any truth&#xD;
can be told in the spirit of love.&#xD;
"And you are wasting away-you will be thrown upon&#xD;
your sick bed-then what will become of your child ?"&#xD;
"Alas, God knows! If we both could die-"&#xD;
Yes, if you both could. Death is no evil at all." As&#xD;
the actress said this, her hollow, shadowy face gre~ dark,&#xD;
and her large, luminous eyes glanced aside, and fell u~ri the&#xD;
floor-fixed in an intense, suffering, almost querulous gaze-&#xD;
as if of one enduring pain. "It must come abruptly at last,"&#xD;
she said, looking up, suddenly. "My dear, have you any&#xD;
insurmountable prejudices against a theatrical life for your-&#xD;
self?"&#xD;
Startled by the abruptness of the proposition, Zuleiine raised&#xD;
her eyes to the beautiful, dark, irritated countenance before&#xD;
her, without replying.-&#xD;
"You don't understand me. Well, then, to put it plainer,&#xD;
if nothing better at all could be found for you, would you&#xD;
absolutely refuse to go upon the stage ?"&#xD;
Zuleime had understood her very well, and if she still&#xD;
hesitated, it was -from a reluctance to wound the spirit of the&#xD;
actress.&#xD;
"Do you, then, consider the histrionic profession disreputa-&#xD;

ble'?" asked Mrs. Knight, with the same suffering, querulous,&#xD;
almost cross expression of the eyes.&#xD;
"No," said Zuleime, very gently, "I do not. Not the&#xD;
profession that Mrs. Siddons ennobled. I think it truly&#xD;
"'The youngest of the sister arts,&#xD;
Where all their beauties blend.'"&#xD;
"Well, then, my question-Would you object to going on&#xD;
the stage yourself ?"&#xD;
"I am not fit for it," replied Zuleime, evasively.&#xD;
"I do not know that. I need not ~tell you that you are&#xD;
young and pretty, and singularly graceful-nor that you have&#xD;
a very fine voice for singing.~-these form a very good founda-&#xD;
tion. And in elocution, my dear, I would myself become&#xD;
your instructress. What say you ?"&#xD;
"That you are kinder to me than any one has ever been&#xD;
since I left home; and that I am very, very grateful," Zn-&#xD;
leime said, very gently.&#xD;
"But that you despise the calling too thoroughly to follow&#xD;
it, even for ~ said the actress, bitterly.&#xD;
"No, no~~LI did not say or mean that, indeed-but I, you&#xD;
see, have neither the taste, talent, nor courage requisite !"&#xD;
"Why not ?"&#xD;
"I was brought up in the privacy of domestic life; in the&#xD;
deep seclusion of the country. I have never been used to&#xD;
society much less to publicity, and IL am sure, that no matter&#xD;
how ~1l I might be instructed in my part, when I should&#xD;
come before an audience, I should forget all about it, and&#xD;
half die of shame."&#xD;
"Ah, I suppose you have no vocation for it. An actress&#xD;
forgets her own identity in that of the character she repre-&#xD;
sents, and that enables her to go through things she could&#xD;
not otherwise endure. But, my dear, I do not see anything&#xD;
else you can do; and as for the 'stage fright,' as it is called&#xD;
among us, you would soon get that off."&#xD;
Zuleim~ shook her head.&#xD;
"My dear, you do not yet k~o~ the plan I have for you.&#xD;
I never thought-no one would ever think of a sudden grand&#xD;
debut for you. Nothing but great genius, strong vocation,&#xD;
and perfect self-possession on the part of the debutante,&#xD;
would justify such a thing. No-the art must be acquired,&#xD;
as other arts are-slowly. This is the plan IL had for you,&#xD;
and it entirely precludes the possibility of a stage fright,&#xD;
&#xD;
since you are gradually inured to it. Do you understand me,&#xD;
"No, I do not !"&#xD;
oP~V~ll~ then, for instance-and to come to the point! The&#xD;
season is about to commence, and the manager wishes&#xD;
to engage about half-a-dozen young girls as chorus singers.&#xD;
Will you be one'? The lowest salary they ever give a chorus&#xD;
singer is six dollars a week-that is four times as much as&#xD;
you ever earned by the tedious needle. Will you consent?"&#xD;
Still Zuleitne was silent.&#xD;
"After the opera season is over, I make no doubt that&#xD;
your youth, beauty and grace, and your very fine voice, will&#xD;
secure you a permanent engagement at an advanced salary.&#xD;
Will you go with me to the manager to-morrow'?"&#xD;
"No," said Zuleime, "I should not dare to go upon the&#xD;
stage. I could not face an audience."&#xD;
"And you need not face tl~em ! You would be in a group&#xD;
of young girls, and no one would notice you, except casually&#xD;
as a part of the scenery. The attention of the audience is&#xD;
taken up with the principal performers. Besides, no one will&#xD;
know who you are. Your name need not appear upon the&#xD;
bills. I will take every care of your feelings, if, indeed, you&#xD;
* can be sensible of them when hunger and cold are felt."&#xD;
"I do not like the life," said Zuleime. "I had almost as&#xD;
willingly starve."&#xD;
The actress arose and rung the bell.&#xD;
"Oh! it is nothing to me, Mrs. Fairfax. Do as you ease.&#xD;
I have no earthly interest to serve in persuading you to this&#xD;
step," she said, with the old, cross, querulous look on her&#xD;
haggard face, and in her beautiful dark, gray eyes.&#xD;
Bertha came in and cleared away the table.&#xD;
Mrs. Knight walked up and down the room in a hasty,&#xD;
irritated manner.&#xD;
"I wish I was at work again! I am sick of my holiday&#xD;
already! Since I cannot afford to abandon this hateful art,&#xD;
I wish I were always delving at it, and there came no pause&#xD;
for self-recollectionD I ~vish I were perpetually Queen&#xD;
Katherine, Mrs, Hailer, Isabella, Imogene, Lady Macbeth,&#xD;
Bianca Fazio, and the others, going incessantly through the&#xD;
circle like the earth through the signs of the zodiac. I wish&#xD;
I were always somebody else, anybody else than poor Ida&#xD;
Knight." And she threw herself into a chair, glancing at&#xD;
Zuleime with a strained, appealing, accusing look. But the&#xD;

&#xD;
wan face of the dying girl, with its hectic flush, smote the&#xD;
rock in her heart, and she moved to her side and took her&#xD;
hand and said, gently, though with the same tone and look&#xD;
of querulous suffering, "It is a wretched life! I feel it so-&#xD;
only it is not so bad as starving, and seeing your child starve.&#xD;
My dear, it is something to me whether I persuade you to do&#xD;
this thing or not. I cannot bear to see you suffer so. Your&#xD;
necessities weigh upon my heart-in addition to my own. And&#xD;
really," she added, with the same frowning, irritated look,&#xD;
"really, I have such a burden of my own, that I grow res-&#xD;
tive under a feather of anybody else's."&#xD;
"Then do not take my sorrows on your shoulders, dear&#xD;
lady; I canbear them myself, or die under their weight un-&#xD;
complainingly. Do not take my troubles to heart !" said&#xD;
Zuleimo, gently.&#xD;
The actress looked up with a sharp, rebuking glance, say-.&#xD;
ing-.&#xD;
"As if I could help it! You are not sincere when you&#xD;
ask me to do so! No, the only way I can get your griefs off&#xD;
my heart is to get them off your own. I must get you into&#xD;
living circumstances. I must persuade you to go onthe stage&#xD;
with me. It is not a pleasant profession for a lady, I grant&#xD;
you-neither is freezing or starving, and getting into debt&#xD;
and being dunned and rebuffed, pleasant-.-but---" she added,&#xD;
with a look of almost fierce s~lf.assertion and self'~defence-&#xD;
"ne~er is it actually sinful, that I know of. It necessarily&#xD;
tran~resses no command of God with which I am acquainted.&#xD;
One need not be a heathen because she\ is an actress. Mrs.&#xD;
Siddons was a member in full com~un~on with the Church&#xD;
of England. The stage has its dangers, I grant yo~i, but you&#xD;
may safely pass through them; if you please. I have done so!&#xD;
I was not born or brought up to that life, my dear; I was the&#xD;
daughter of an ]3~nglish country curate-then a nursery go-&#xD;
verness-then a traveling' companion to an earl's daughter&#xD;
-then I accidentally met with my husband, and we married&#xD;
from mutual affection. He was a tragedian-that is the way&#xD;
in which I became an actress. Now I follow the histrionic&#xD;
profession as the only means of living left open to me. I&#xD;
have seen the dangers-nay, I have felt them. But nightly&#xD;
-no matter how utterly wearied out with toil I may have&#xD;
been, I have uttered two lines of sincere prayer, that God&#xD;
would keep me from falling into deeper sin. And He has&#xD;
kept me! Does that surprise you? God is the God of the&#xD;
&#xD;
publican as well as of the Pharisee. Who dares excommuni-&#xD;
cate mc? What child of the Universal Father shall dare to&#xD;
say that another is excluded from His love and care and pro-&#xD;
tection ~ Verily, the day of Judgment will be a day of&#xD;
startling revelations. And many that are first shall be last,&#xD;
and the last shall be first." And then the actress fell into&#xD;
silence, and her fine Countenance lost that look of captious&#xD;
self-defence, and settled into meditative earnestness.&#xD;
Zuleime arose to go. Mrs. Knight took her hand, rind&#xD;
said, gently-&#xD;
"My dear, think over what I have proposed to you. If&#xD;
you decide to accept my proposition, I will take every pos-&#xD;
sible care of you. You shall be as my own daughter. I&#xD;
will shield you from all dangers. I will instruct you&#xD;
in your art. And I will give you the freedom of my ward-&#xD;
robe. Good-night. Will you kiss me&#xD;
And she drew Zuleime tq her bosom. The poor girl&#xD;
pressed her lips to those of the actress, and slipping through&#xD;
the door, passed up in the dark and cold to her own&#xD;
room.&#xD;
Ida welit to bed, but the poor, generous, irritable woman&#xD;
could not sleep for sympathy, for anxiety, and for the sound&#xD;
of Zuleime's racking cough. "She will never be able to&#xD;
sing much, I am really afraid. But she shall be paid well&#xD;
for dressing~ and for making her beautiful face and form a&#xD;
part of the pageantry-thiat I am determined upon, if I 4mave&#xD;
any influence with the management," thought Ida, a~she&#xD;
sank to sleep.&#xD;
Rusty and threadbare clothing, broken shoes, cold, hun-&#xD;
ger; and a suffering child, are fQ~ible arguments, and&#xD;
they seconded the persuasions of Ida with tremendous&#xD;
power.&#xD;
Zuleime yielded, and was carried down the current of fate&#xD;
as easily, with as little resistance as the sapling beaten down&#xD;
by the rain, uprooted by the wind, an4 carried off by the&#xD;
flood, is whirled down the stream.&#xD;
It was the fatal night of the 26th of December, 1811,&#xD;
the night of the burning of the Richmond Theatre, a night&#xD;
ever to be remembered in the annals of that city, and ever&#xD;
to be mourned in the hearts of her citizens. That evening&#xD;
more than six hundred- lovers of pleasure were gayl~y pre-&#xD;
paring~for the theatre; not dreaming, alas! that they aleo&#xD;
were doomed to take fearful part in an awful tragedy-a&#xD;

69&#xD;
&#xD;
68                  TUE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
tragedy unprecedented in the history of the stage. Before&#xD;
eight o'clock, more than six hundred persons, from pleasant&#xD;
'city homes all around, assembled in the fated building; be-&#xD;
fore twelve o'clock, more than one hundred had perished&#xD;
horribly in the flames! and the scarcely surviving five hun-&#xD;
'dred, many wounded, maimed, or burned, all despairingly&#xD;
mourning the awful fate of nearest relatives and friends, re-&#xD;
turned or' were borne back to their desolate homes!&#xD;
That afternoon, unprophetic of doom as any of the others,&#xD;
Zuleime and her friend were preparing to go on the stage.&#xD;
Zuleime had no part to perform-she was as yet only an&#xD;
attachi-and was to-appear but in one scene, as one of a grouj&#xD;
of villagers. She was engaged in fixing up a peasant dress,&#xD;
consisting of a straw hat, black spencer, short gray skirt,&#xD;
and striped stockings. Mrs. Knight was, as usual, doing two&#xD;
things at once-arranging her costume and studying her part.&#xD;
But the eyes of Ida often wandered towards Zuleime, as she&#xD;
heard that hacking, racking cough, and she noticed with pain&#xD;
the waning face. Yes! within a few days even, the thin&#xD;
face had become perceptibly thinner, and the flushed cheek&#xD;
burned with a darker crimson. "And she will in e a sorry&#xD;
looking peasant," thought Ida;' "a very sorry peasant, with&#xD;
that delicate, spiritual, almost arial face and form of hers. -&#xD;
How absurdly inappropriate are most of the affairs we get&#xD;
up! Truly, our art is in therear of all others. Now, this&#xD;
evening, all go on as villagers-vulgar and refin~id-all&#xD;
reduced to one level. Those coarse, brawny Miss Butchers,&#xD;
and this fragile, delicate Zuleime, all peasants-very well&#xD;
for the Miss Butcher~but for Zuleime! To-morrow evening&#xD;
all go on as fairies; e' " llent well for this aerial Zuleime, but&#xD;
for the Miss Butchers. Well, our notions are fanciful as&#xD;
arbitrary-and there may be peasants who have delicate,&#xD;
white, semi-transparent fingers, and there may be fairies with&#xD;
large, flat feet, and great red hands, foi aught we know."&#xD;
While Mrs. Knight silently cogitated, and covered her white&#xD;
satin shoes anew~ and studied her part, Zuleime worked on&#xD;
also in silence, but too despairing, too exhausted, even&#xD;
to think of the wayward fate which had brought her to this -&#xD;
pass.&#xD;
At about sunset their preparations were completed. Ida,&#xD;
as usual, rang for her cup of coffee and her errand boy, and&#xD;
packed up and sent away the costume for the evening. Then&#xD;
~he put her own little girl and Zuleime'~ child to 0leep to-&#xD;
&#xD;
getiier in her bed, and got Bertha .to promise. to look in, in&#xD;
1 he ~~ourse of the evening, and see that all was safe. And&#xD;
ihen poor Ida carefully wrapped Zuleime up in her own man-&#xD;
tifla, and wound her own furs around her neck, saying, in&#xD;
answer to all expostulation-&#xD;
"Never mind me, riiy dear! I've got no cough. Hag-&#xD;
gard as I look, I'm whit-leather! You must take care of&#xD;
your poor little self."&#xD;
And then they left the house, walking briskly through&#xD;
the biting air, and crunching the crusted snow under their&#xD;
quick footsteps. Though but little after sunset, owing to&#xD;
the heavy clouds, it was almost dark when they hurried.&#xD;
along the streets. There was the usual number of foot-pas-&#xD;
serigers abroad, and once, as the slight figure of a man in a&#xD;
military cloak swiftly hurried past, Mrs. Knight felt her arm&#xD;
suddenly grasped with spasmodic force by her companion,&#xD;
and turning around, she saw the face of Zuleime deadly&#xD;
pale.&#xD;
"Why, what is the matter, my dear child ?"&#xD;
"Nothing, nothing !" said Zuleime; "let us hurry on."&#xD;
"But~you are trembling like an aspen leaf! You have&#xD;
walked too far-you are not strong enough for this evening's&#xD;
work; let me take you home again."&#xD;
"No, no, no, no! let's go on !"      -&#xD;
"Why, Zuleime__"&#xD;
"Oh, it is nothing-nothing when you hear it! I-I felt&#xD;
the presence of one long dead! It was weak nerves, or fancy,&#xD;
'or perhaps the prescience of one, on the confines of the unseen&#xD;
world. Let us hasten on."&#xD;
They hurried along. In the meantime, he who had passed&#xD;
them, the slight man in the military cloak, walked on down&#xD;
the square, suddenly stopped, muttered to himself, "Absurd!'&#xD;
impossible !" then went on again, again stopped, as by an&#xD;
irresistible impulse, turned and rapidly retraced his steps,&#xD;
after the two ladies in black,- overtook them, was close be-&#xD;
hind them, hilt not placing any confidence in what he termed&#xD;
his own wild thoughts, he dared not accost or peep under the&#xD;
bonnets of two reserved and closely veiled women. But he&#xD;
kept them in sight until he saw them enter the side door of&#xD;
the theatre. Then he asked a door-keeper--&#xD;
"Who are those ~"&#xD;
"Two of the ladies attached to the theatre," replied the&#xD;
man.&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.            71&#xD;
&#xD;
"Fool that I was !'~' exclaimed Frank Fairfax, as he&#xD;
turned away.&#xD;
Captain Fairfax had reached Richmond that day at noon-.-&#xD;
too late, by half a day, for the stage to I , whither he&#xD;
would have gone, if possible, on the wings of the wind. His&#xD;
mother, warned by the newspapers, had been daily expecting&#xD;
his arrival, and was prepared to receive him when he pre-&#xD;
sented' himself. He had spent the whole afternoon with her&#xD;
at Fairview House, and in the evening had walked out to&#xD;
book his place in the next day's stage for L.-..-.---.. It was&#xD;
when hurrying along on that errand, that he passed so near&#xD;
his wife, electrifying her with his unknown. presence, and&#xD;
being himself drawn to follow, and to hover near her all the&#xD;
evening. For when he had turned from the theatre, and&#xD;
hurried onand reached the stage office and secured his place,&#xD;
finding out that the coach did not start till three o'clock the&#xD;
next morning, he said to himself-.&#xD;
"How on earth shall I contrive to forget some of these&#xD;
miserable hours that must intervene before Ii ean fly to my&#xD;
wife? 'My mother's ill-health obliges her to retire early to&#xD;
bed. If I go back to Fairview House, I shall have the whole&#xD;
'mansion to myself. I will even go to the theatre, and see&#xD;
if I can find out among the women ~there the particular&#xD;
one whose air and gait reminded me so strongly of my Zn-&#xD;
leiine."&#xD;
And so to the theatre he went. It was quite' early,. and&#xD;
he was fortunate 'in securing a seat in the centre of the first&#xD;
row of boxes, immediately~ in front of the stage. In the. mean-&#xD;
time, Zuleime had been conducted 'by'Mrs. Knight into the&#xD;
theatre, and introduced into the eommQn dressing-room of.&#xD;
the stock actresses. This was a large room, with a broad&#xD;
shelf or dresser running around three sides of the walls, and&#xD;
about four feet from 'the floor. This ~served as bureaus,&#xD;
dressiug~tables, 'and wash.-stands 'for nine women, each of the&#xD;
three sides'being occupied by .three, who equally divided the&#xD;
shelf, each one having her hand-boxes under the shelf, and&#xD;
her looking-glass on top 'of it, leaning. against the wall,&#xD;
'and her wash-basin, jars of rouge, boxes of powder, pots of&#xD;
poniatum, etc., standing around it. On introducing her&#xD;
companion into~ this apartment, 'Mm's. Knight said.-&#xD;
"All women belonging to the theatre use this as a co~n-&#xD;
mon dressing-room, except the ballet girls,, who have one to&#xD;
&#xD;
themselves, and the stars, who have separate and well fur-&#xD;
nished rooms.~~&#xD;
About half a dozen women were present now, each before&#xD;
~her own glass, with her own tallow candle, niaking her&#xD;
toilet.&#xD;
"Who's that, Knight, that you've got there 'I" asked a&#xD;
coarse-featured, 'black-eyed girl, who always played the&#xD;
hoyden, or the wit, and fondly believed herself a proficient&#xD;
in the Rosalind and Beatrice line. "I say, Knight! is that&#xD;
the young 'lady?"' she repeated, turning around with a&#xD;
little wad of raw cotton, dipped in carmine, between her&#xD;
finger and thumb, and exhibiting a face in process of being&#xD;
rejuvenated-namely, with one young and. blooming ebeek,&#xD;
and one prematurely old and sallow.'&#xD;
"Yes, this is the young lady, Barry," said 1~Irs. Knight,&#xD;
very gravely, as she led her prot~g~ off to her o~vn' corner 'of&#xD;
the common dresser.&#xD;
"I think she might have sent her down with the ballet&#xD;
girls, as she is really one of them," grumbled a large, im-&#xD;
portant looking female, arranging a huge turban and curls&#xD;
upon her head, at the farther end' of the room. Two new&#xD;
ideas besides that of the common dressing-room and the dress-&#xD;
ing shelf in general, Zuleime had got-namely, first, that there&#xD;
really was some very lofty notions of rank and exclusiveness&#xD;
even among the members of the stock company of a second&#xD;
rate theatre-secondly, that they really, after all, did not&#xD;
differ much in that or any other respect from people she had&#xD;
met in very high society, except, indeed, that' they had the&#xD;
odious habit of calling each other "Knight" or "Barry,"&#xD;
as men do, witho~jt a prefix of any sort.&#xD;
Mrs. Knight dressed herself for her part, as she was to&#xD;
appear in the early scene in the play, and then gave the use&#xD;
of her toilet nook to Zuleime. But the cold walk through&#xD;
the evening air, and the stamiding in the chilly dressing-room,&#xD;
had so increased her cough, that Mrs. Knight went out. and&#xD;
sent a call-boy for opium, and' administered a dose. It was&#xD;
under the inlhience of that stupefier that Zuleime, leaning&#xD;
on the arm of Mrs. Knight, entered that terra-incognita,, the&#xD;
green-room. It was a long room, papered, curtained, car-&#xD;
peted, furnished with sofas and easy-chairs, and warmed by&#xD;
a fine coal fire-upon the whole it differed in no other re-&#xD;
spect than its motley crowd, from a large family. parlor.&#xD;
Mrs. Knight conducted her 'to a corner of the aefa nearest&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC7854-00000032"/>&#xD;
the fire, and leaving her sitting there, obeyed the' call-boy's&#xD;
summons, and went upon the~stage. 'Composed into a dreamy&#xD;
state by the opium, Zuleime sat there while the strange&#xD;
scene, with its fantastical crowd, passed before her like the&#xD;
phantasmagoria of a midnight dream. And all this time&#xD;
Frank sat in the centre box .of the front row, not seeing the&#xD;
play enacting before him-not thinking of it, only seeing the&#xD;
turnpike road to I~ . Only thinking of th~ dearest&#xD;
girl in the world, whom he should meet at the end of his&#xD;
journey. Paper walls again!&#xD;
Zuleime remained in the corner of the sofa near the fire&#xD;
in the green-room, not thinking at all, not even dreaming,&#xD;
only conscious in a vague dreamy way, that a strange vision,&#xD;
changing and changing like figures in the kaleidoscope, was&#xD;
passing before her. She was scarcely aroused by Mrs.&#xD;
Knight's gentle voice, saying in her ear-&#xD;
." Come, my dear, it is time for~you to go on now. Come,&#xD;
don't be afraid Bless you, you are nobody, you know. No&#xD;
one will look at yotm. You will be only one of a group that&#xD;
forms a sort of back-ground to the scene. Come, I will go&#xD;
with you to the side entrance, where the others stand."&#xD;
Zuleime obeyed mechanically, and was led, between vari-&#xD;
ous walls of canvas, to a side entrance, at which were&#xD;
grouped a number of persons in villagers' costume.&#xD;
"There, 'just go on with the crowd, and stand there; that&#xD;
is all you have to do," whispered Mrs. Knight, as she left&#xD;
her.&#xD;
And at the same moment the group moved on, carrying&#xD;
the somnolent Zuleime with them, and she found herself in a&#xD;
dazzling glare of light, and heard the deafening rant of a&#xD;
stentorian lunged actor near her, and grew painfully con-&#xD;
scious of the many hundred eyes upon the scene, upon her-'&#xD;
self, perhaps-and dared not raise her eyes an instant from&#xD;
the floor, upon which, with a deeply burning cheek, they&#xD;
were fixed. But suddenly an attraction-a fatality.A.~I know&#xD;
not what.*~-hut something stronger than her fear, stronger&#xD;
than her will, drew her glance up to the centre box of the&#xD;
front row, and her eyes met Frank's .eyes. Yes, there he&#xD;
sat, gazing at her, astonished, fixed, spell-bound as by a&#xD;
night-mare, without the power of moving or waking. She!&#xD;
she too, gazed for a moment. She was not astonished at&#xD;
seeing him there, any more than she would have been aston-&#xD;
ished at dreaming of seeing him anywhere. It was all like&#xD;
&#xD;
a wild dream, everything! It seemed not unnatural that he&#xD;
5hoald form a part of it. Only to her weakened and half-&#xD;
stupefied brain, the last, nearest event was the most distinct&#xD;
-and so, strangely, she did not think of hi~ death or life,&#xD;
but only of the reproach. she had brought upon him, her&#xD;
proud Frank, in appearing there !' and covering her face with&#xD;
I both hands, she sank. to her knees upon the floor.&#xD;
It was lucky the drop-curtain fell just then. It was lucky&#xD;
the audience took that by-scene for a partr of the play. But~&#xD;
to Zulejine it was still like a fever-dream, from which she&#xD;
tried to wake. Like a dream the &amp;amp;op-curtain' had rolled&#xD;
down. But not like a dream was the rough seizure of her&#xD;
arm by a girl who set her upon her feet, and said, in a not.&#xD;
unfriendly tone-&#xD;
"What did you do that for ~ T1za~  wasn't a part of your&#xD;
part."&#xD;
"I-I-.have," began Zuleimne, passing her hand back and&#xD;
forth across her forehead, "I have been taking opium to stop&#xD;
my cough. I-never was used to it, and I think it has be-&#xD;
wildered me a little; don't yow think so&#xD;
"I think something has! Wake up, and try' to listen to&#xD;
what is going on. Mr. -~ is going to sing now. Come&#xD;
off."&#xD;
As the girl led her' away between the walls of canvas,&#xD;
one of those insignificant incidents occurred, upon which&#xD;
nevertheless the fate of hundreds sometimes hang. Away&#xD;
among the back scenes through which they passed to reach&#xD;
the green-room, there was a chandelier hanging flaring in the&#xD;
draught. A boy seeeined busy with it.&#xD;
"Hoist it up higher, sir, why don't you P' exclaimed one&#xD;
of the players, who happened to come up~&#xD;
"If I do, it will' set fire to the scenes," replied the boy.&#xD;
"Confound your insolence, do you think I woi4d gWe you&#xD;
the order, if there were the least danger ~ Do as you arc&#xD;
directed, sir.~~&#xD;
The boy obeyed; and the scenery instantly took f~i. The&#xD;
chandelier was hastily drawn down; the alarm was given in&#xD;
the rear of the stage, and a scene shifter directed to cut the&#xD;
cords by which the combustible material was suspended. But&#xD;
the mm became panic-struck and fled.&#xD;
The performers and their assistants in vain sought to tear&#xD;
down the scenery.~ The canvas was covered with a resinous&#xD;
composition, and th~ draught of wind was strong; and Zn-&#xD;

leime and her companioD were swiftly encircled by walls of&#xD;
blazing canvas. The strong girl, terror-stricken, left her&#xD;
weak companion and fled. And the poor invalid, forgotten&#xD;
by all in the terror and confusion; sank down overpowered,&#xD;
suffocated by th~ heat and smoke. All this had happened&#xD;
in less than three minutes from the raising of the chandelier.&#xD;
And at this time one of the performers was playing near&#xD;
the orchestra, and the greater part of the stage, with its ap-&#xD;
palling danger, was fatally concealed from the t(udience by&#xD;
the curtain. The flames spread with the rapidity of light'.&#xD;
fling; and the first notice the audience had of their danger,&#xD;
was the fire falling ~ from the ceiling upon the head of the&#xD;
performer Even then many supposed it to be a p~art of the&#xD;
play, and were for a short time restrained from flight by a&#xD;
cry from the stage that there was no danger. IBut soon the&#xD;
fire flashed in every part of the house with a rapidity hor-&#xD;
rible and appalling. Then terror seized upon the hearts of&#xD;
all, and the audience broke up in confusion. Those in the&#xD;
pit escaped by the pit entrance, and were every one saved.&#xD;
Those in the boxes, who, had they known it, might at first&#xD;
have escaped by way of the pit, all turned and hurried to'.&#xD;
wards the only door of egress into the lobby. This door&#xD;
was unfortunately hung to open on the inside. And this&#xD;
circumstance was fatally overlooked by the frenzied crowd,&#xD;
who pressed and pressed against the door, trying to push it&#xD;
open, but really keeping it fast closed. The fire advanced&#xD;
upon them, filling the house with suffocating smoke, and with&#xD;
flame that seized the clothing of those behind, goading them&#xD;
horribly to still more frantic pressure upon those before.&#xD;
The most frightful uproar ensued; women shrieking, pray-&#xD;
ing-men groaning, expostulating; all crowding one upon&#xD;
another, or rather hundreds upon hundreds, and all pressing&#xD;
towards the door that would not yield. The pit was now a&#xD;
lake of fire, darting out huge tongues of flame that wound&#xD;
themselves around the forms of the hindmost, who fell&#xD;
shrivels into the blaze. Then arose cries of horror, an-&#xD;
guish and despair-children crying for lost parents, and pa-&#xD;
rents calling in agony upon the names of missing children-&#xD;
for in the fierce pushing and struggling for life, parties got&#xD;
separated and -families divided-children forced from the&#xD;
piirents, women from their protectors, and the weaker un-&#xD;
consciously thrown down and trampled to death by the strong.&#xD;
Many, half roasted, dropped into the ,burning pit; many&#xD;

with their garments in flames, maddened by pain and terror,&#xD;

way at the cost of broken limbs. And at last the door&#xD;
yielded; and as many as possible escaped that way; but to&#xD;
what a life; alas! darkened forever by the memory of dearest&#xD;
relatives and friends who perished in the fire. The whole&#xD;
building was now in flames. In less than an hour all was&#xD;
over. Naught remained but a heap of smoking ruins; and&#xD;
around them the agonized crowd of those who liVed and&#xD;
raved-and around these again, an awe-struck, mourning&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
"IN PALACE CHAMBERS."&#xD;
She sleeps: her breathings are not heard&#xD;
In palace chambers far apart,&#xD;
The fragrant tresses are not stirred&#xD;
That lie upon her ~harmed heart.&#xD;
She sleeps: on either side upswells&#xD;
The downy pillow lightly prest;&#xD;
She sleeps, nor dreams, hut only dwells&#xD;
A perfect form in perh~ct rest.-TENNYSON.&#xD;
THE spell that bound Captain Fairfax, when he recognized&#xD;
his wife upon the stage, was broken by the fall of the drop&#xD;
curtain. He instantly left the boxes and hastened around&#xD;
behind the scenes. After many bt4ilesl inquiries, and many&#xD;
misdirections, he prosecuted his sear alone, and at length&#xD;
found her prostrate form. The wind had blown the smoke&#xD;
and flame in' another direction, and she lay there uninjured,&#xD;
though insensible, and in extremity of danger. He raised&#xD;
her, threw his cloak around her, ran with her into the fresh&#xD;
air, called a hackney coach, placed her in it, jumped in and&#xD;
tool his seat by her side, drew her insensible form within his&#xD;
arms, upon his bosom, and directed the coachman to drive&#xD;
rapidly to Fairview House. As they passed swiftly through&#xD;
the streets, the cry of "Fire! fire! fire !" rung through the&#xD;
air, but he scarcely heard it. The rushing of crowds of&#xD;
people in the opposite direction to that in which they were&#xD;
driving, frequently impeded the progress of the carriage, but&#xD;
he scarcely knew it. All his senses, all his thoughts, all his&#xD;
emotions were absorbed in the ~entlc form that lay swooning&#xD;
on his bosom. And "Oh! how thin she is! how thin, good&#xD;
Heaven !" he groaned many times, as he held his arm around&#xD;
the fragile waist, or felt the emaciated arm and hand, or&#xD;
pressed his cheek against the wan face. "How thim she is,&#xD;
good Heaven, how thin! Is this illness? Illness unto death,&#xD;
perhaps! Drive fast, coachman! Fast!" He longed to lay&#xD;
her at rest upon her bed, that he might perchance silence his&#xD;
anxiety. And-" Faster, coachman! Faster !" he continued&#xD;
&#xD;
to cry, whenever the thickening crowd arrested 4ie progress&#xD;
of the carriage.&#xD;
At length they reached Fairview House. He lifted her&#xD;
out and bore her into the hall. His mother had retired to&#xD;
rest long since; but he rang the bell violently, and said, to&#xD;
the astonished servants, who came at the summons-&#xD;
"Go instantly and prepare a room for my wife. I have&#xD;
but just saved her from the burning theatre !'? The wonder..&#xD;
struck maids h~iirried to obey. "Stop! Don't disturb your&#xD;
mistress, on your lives," he said, and with this warning, dis-&#xD;
missed them. To one of the men present, he exclaimed,&#xD;
"" Run instantly to Doctor Cummings, and ask him to hurry&#xD;
The man disappeared to obey. And during the issuing of&#xD;
these orders, Frank Fairfax was sitting on the sofa, sustain-&#xD;
ing the fainting form of his wife with one arm, while with&#xD;
the other hand he unlaced thc velvet bodice. Presently one&#xD;
of the maids returned and announced that the room was&#xD;
ready. And Frank raised and carried his precious burden&#xD;
'up stairs, into a pleasant front chamber, and laid her on a&#xD;
bed. Then, with the assistance of one of the women, he got&#xD;
off the stage dress, and supplied its place with one of his&#xD;
mother's white wrappers, brought for the purpose by one of&#xD;
the maids.&#xD;
He had scarcely done this, when the chamber door opened,&#xD;
and old Mrs. Fairfax entered, roused up by the noise in and&#xD;
outside the house. She came in, wrapped in a flannel dress*&#xD;
ing-gown, and saying, anxiously-&#xD;
"My dear Frank! they tell me that the Richmond The-&#xD;
atre is on fire. I am so grateful that you are not there. Ah!&#xD;
what is this? Who is that ?" she asked, perceiving the form&#xD;
~of Zuleime upon the bed, and advancing towards it. "Some&#xD;
sufferer you have saved from the fire, my dear Frank? God&#xD;
bless your brave, kind heart, my dear boy. But you should&#xD;
not have brought her in here-.or you should not be here&#xD;
~yourself. Retire, and leave the lady to the care of myself&#xD;
my women," coReluded the lady, gravely.&#xD;
"My dearest mother, yes! She is a sufferer I have saved from&#xD;
the fire! a most beloved sufferer! my wife! my wife! Dear-&#xD;
est mother, I cannot leave her! I have a right to stay here."&#xD;
Here followed a wild, hasty disclosure of his imprudent&#xD;
marriage, kept secret up to that n~oment. And ~then timid&#xD;

&#xD;
fact of Mr. filifton's death, and of Zuleime's disappearance&#xD;
and suspected suicide. In bitter self-reproach, Frank had&#xD;
made his confession-~--in deepest sorrow, he heard his mother's&#xD;
revelations.&#xD;
"How much she must have suffered! Good Heaven! how&#xD;
much she must have suffered! he exclaimed. Then almost&#xD;
madly he cried, "Mother! look at her! Look at her! Oh,&#xD;
tell me, do you think she can live P'&#xD;
Mrs. Fairfax had been all this time chafing her temples&#xD;
with cologne, while the two maids rubbed her hands and feet.&#xD;
But up to this instant she had given no signs of recovery,&#xD;
or of consciousness. And the old lady shook her head&#xD;
mournfully, and plunged Frank into deeper despair. They&#xD;
persevered in their efforts for half an hour longer, and then&#xD;
she sighed and opened her eyes. Her husband was bending&#xD;
over her. She met his eyes, and smiled faintly in recogni-&#xD;
tion, without astonishment, and without joy-indeed she was&#xD;
too feeble for either-and murmuring, "Dearest Frank,"*&#xD;
she sank away again, fainting, they supposed, until her low&#xD;
breathing revealed that she slept the sleep of utter prostra-&#xD;
tion. And how changed was now that countenance. The&#xD;
look of weariness, care and sorrow had vanished, and the~&#xD;
sweet, wan face wore the easy, confiding air of infancy; and&#xD;
even in sleep, she must have felt the shelter of protecting love&#xD;
around her, for often with closed eyes she smiled, as in de-&#xD;
lighted visions! All night they watched beside her bed while&#xD;
she slept. In the morning the doctor arrived. He had been&#xD;
absent all uight, by the couch of one who had been severely&#xD;
burned at the theatre, and that accounted for failure to&#xD;
come before morning; now, however, he stood beside the&#xD;
patient with grave and thoughtful brow.&#xD;
"Doctor, for Heaven's sake give me some hope of her!&#xD;
Tell me something about her, at least! Is she ill 'P'&#xD;
"She is very ill," replied the physician.&#xD;
"I cannot believe it! I will not believe it! See how&#xD;
sweetly she sleeps! how comfortably! how free from suffer..&#xD;
ing!"&#xD;
"Yes-but, my dear Captain Fairfax, there would be more&#xD;
hope if there were more suffering-however, the case may be&#xD;
much more favorable than it appears to me now; I cannot&#xD;
fully judge of it until she wakes."&#xD;
"Allow me to arouse her, then! Nay, I wish to do it!&#xD;
I have not spoken to her yet! Let me wake her now !"&#xD;
&#xD;
"By no means! It might prove fatal. Indeed, you must&#xD;
be very careful. Her life hangs by a thread. Sleep will do&#xD;
her more good now than anything else. When she awakes&#xD;
naturally, you may send for me at once." And so saying,&#xD;
the doctor took leave, without even writing a prescription.&#xD;
Soon after he left the house she opened her eyes again,&#xD;
and seeing Frank, smiled faintly, and murmured-&#xD;
"My own-my dearest--dearest husband." And in an&#xD;
instant her senses seemed swallowed up again in sleep, which&#xD;
lasted half an hour, at the end of which she awoke again, and&#xD;
looked around in uneasiness, and breathed, half aloud,-.&#xD;
"My child-rny baby-..-iny little Fan-" and then sank away&#xD;
again, as if she were too feeble to retain her hold on con-&#xD;
sciousness.&#xD;
"What is she talking about, dear mother ?" inquired&#xD;
Frank, in the extremity of anxiety, when hehea~d her words.&#xD;
Mrs. Fairfax shook her head, and said she did not know.&#xD;
But the woman who waited in the chamber came forward,&#xD;
and said that if her mistress would excuse her interfering,&#xD;
she would tell them what the young lady meant.&#xD;
"Speak on, then, at once, in the name of the Lord !" ex-&#xD;
claimed Frank, impatiently.&#xD;
Mrs. Fairfax endorsed his order. And then the woman&#xD;
informed her mistress that she had known the sick young lady&#xD;
all the winter by sight-that she had been there at the house&#xD;
to ask for sewing-~-.that she took in sewing fora living.-that&#xD;
she lodged at the eabinet~makor's, over the way-and that&#xD;
she had a little girl almosttwo years old, who was no doubt&#xD;
at the cabinet-maker's now, which she supposed was what had&#xD;
made the mother. look around, and inquire so anxiously.&#xD;
The woman's story was~scarcely over before Captain Fair-&#xD;
fax seized his hat, and hurried from the room. As soon as&#xD;
he was gone, Mrs. Fairfax called the woman up before her,&#xD;
and said-&#xD;
"Nelly, you heard your master tell me of his marriage&#xD;
with this young lady V'&#xD;
"I need not tell you that it is my will that there be no&#xD;
kitchen gossip about this matter. This young lady-once&#xD;
Miss Zuleime Clifton, is now, and has been for nearly three&#xD;
years .pa;st, Mrs. Francis Fairfax, the wife of my son, ~nd is&#xD;
also your own young mistress. You understand ~"&#xD;
" Yes, madam.,~&#xD;

&#xD;
" Then let there be no idle conversationi about this mar-&#xD;
riage, if. you would avoid, my severest displeasure."&#xD;
Farther colloquy was arrested~ by the hurried entrance of&#xD;
Captain Fairfax, bringing his little wee girl in his arms. Mrs.&#xD;
Fairfax immediately arose to take her from him, but the&#xD;
child's quick eyes had recognized her mother lying on the&#xD;
bed, and she began to clap her hands and call-&#xD;
"Mamma! mamma !"&#xD;
Frank held her closely, and tried to still her joyful, eager&#xD;
cries, but the magical sound of her child's voice had already&#xD;
awakened the sleeper, and she opened her eyes, and seeing&#xD;
the babe in its father's arms, smiled a feeble smile of content,&#xD;
and fell away again into oblivion.&#xD;
Mrs. Fairfax had the doctor summoned again, and told him&#xD;
that if he wished to see her daughter-in-law awake, be must&#xD;
remain at her bedside, for that she only awoke to relapse&#xD;
instantly into slumber.&#xD;
~~The physician then took his seat by the bedside of his&#xD;
patient, and requested all except a maid-servant to leave the&#xD;
chamber.&#xD;
Mrs. Fairfax and Frank went out, taking the little girl with&#xD;
them, and leaving the doctor with the invalid.&#xD;
After the lapse of an hour, the physician came out and&#xD;
went down stairs. Captain Fairfax was waiting for him in&#xD;
the hall, and drew him into the parlor, anxiously requesting&#xD;
to know his opinion. Perhaps he was really sanguine, and&#xD;
hoped the doctor's verdict might set his fears at rest. At&#xD;
any rate the insisted upon knowing the precise state of the&#xD;
case. The doctor gravely motioned him to sit down, and then&#xD;
took a seat himself. lie said that his patient was not sinking&#xD;
so much under any locaLcfisease as under a general atrophy,&#xD;
for which, considering the circumstances, he could not possibly&#xD;
account-for, if he had met precisely such a case in the very&#xD;
lowest walks of life, he should at once have declared that tho&#xD;
patient had been brought to this state by the want ~f proper&#xD;
and sufficient food-that, in short, she was dying of a slow&#xD;
starvation. A deep groan broke from the lips of Francis&#xD;
Fairfax, and he started up, covered his face with his, hands,&#xD;
and walked the poor in rapid strh~cs. Suddenly he stopped&#xD;
before the physician, with a countenance convulsed with grief&#xD;
and remorse, with all pride and hesitation gone, and exclaim-&#xD;
ed, in thrilling tones-&#xD;
"Doctor! suppose her case-my ~ case had been as&#xD;

you would ha~re surmised, finding it any where else ?-sup..&#xD;
pose that for months past she has been starving.-Great God!&#xD;
-starving !.-Now that th~ cause of this utter failure of the&#xD;
vital powers is removed-now that she has every thing that&#xD;
wealth, that th~ most devoted affection can give her, may she&#xD;
not recruit and live? Oh! tell me&#xD;
The physician answered sternly~&#xD;
"I do not know, sir! This tampering with the laws of&#xD;
life-this pursuing it to the very edge of death is not safe.&#xD;
Is she inclined to take food at all ?"&#xD;
"No---only a little gruel, and that mechanically, without&#xD;
"Exactly-a few days fasting wakes one ravenous, but a&#xD;
long, partial starvation so exhausts the victim, that he loses&#xD;
all inclination for food, as well as all power to assimilate it."&#xD;
The doctor spoke severely.&#xD;
"Sir! I forgive your sternness and your evident suspi..&#xD;
dons1 perhaps they are partially just.. If they were other-&#xD;
wise, God knows I am so stricken that I have scarcely ~&#xD;
hood enough left to resent them~but oh! tell me-do 'not&#xD;
evade the question. Can she be restored? and how ?"&#xD;
"Captain Fairfax, I told you that she was sinking, not so&#xD;
i~iuch under any local disorder as under general atrophy-&#xD;
and yet she has a local disease superinduced by this same&#xD;
slow starvation. Upon examination by the stethoscope, I&#xD;
find tubereles forming upon the left lung. There is also&#xD;
morbid action of the heart. You know how it is with phthisis!&#xD;
With proper care, and under favorable circumstances, the&#xD;
patient may live for years, perhaps for many years, and die&#xD;
at length in old age of something else."&#xD;
"Oh, no care, no pains-nothing that money----nothing&#xD;
that love can do,, shall be wanting! There is hope ?"&#xD;
"I dare not say there, is much hope in' this instance. This&#xD;
atrophy is a very unfavorahl&amp;amp; thing-all our hope is in being&#xD;
able to save the digestive functions. I have l~ft a prescrip-&#xD;

down the floor, convulsed by grief, remorse and fear for&#xD;
her he loved so strongly, and felt he had wronged so greatly.&#xD;
He dared not seek her bedside now in his excited state-.he&#xD;
rushed into his library, locked the door, and gave himself up&#xD;
to all the power of remorse.&#xD;
In the~ afternoon he sought the sick room again. And the&#xD;
deep, sweet peace that pervaded the apartment fell like a&#xD;
soothing spell upmi his excited nerves. The front windows&#xD;
were open, for the day was very fine, and the fresh air and the&#xD;
sunshine came in together, with the cheerful view of the&#xD;
expanse of water, and the wooded hills across James River.&#xD;
The coolness of the air was sufficiently tempered by a glow-&#xD;
ing coal fire in the grate. Zuleime lay raised up with pillows&#xD;
on the bed, and upon the counterpane by her sat her little&#xD;
girl. The face of the youthful mother seemed as soft, as&#xD;
feeble, and as free of care and sorrow as that of the infant&#xD;
herself. On seeing Frank enter, she smiled a gentle, pleased,&#xD;
'childish smile, and feebly moved her hand towards him. He&#xD;

emotions, and kissed, her very gently, but then sank upon&#xD;
his knees, and dropping his face upon her hand,, burst into&#xD;
tears, and wept passionately. 11cr other hand wandered&#xD;
playfully through his curls, and she said, gently-&#xD;
*       "Don't weep, Frank, please don't-indeed I am happy-&#xD;
it is so nice t~ be here-~don't weep.&#xD;
But when men weep and sob, it is no passing shower, like&#xD;
the easily shed tears of women, but a great gust, shaking all&#xD;
the nature. So it was a long time before Frank mastered&#xD;
his emotion. When he recovered, his composure, and arose&#xD;
and sat by her side and looked at her, he found that'the&#xD;
hectic fever burned crimspn on her cheeks, and that her&#xD;
brilliant eyes wandered about deliriously. And he knew&#xD;
that he had harmed her again. And soon she began to talk&#xD;
at random, babbling childishly, delightfully, about White&#xD;
Cliffs, and the forest walks, and the garden. And she a&amp;amp;&#xD;
dressed her father and sister, as if they were present. And&#xD;
very lovingly 'she spoke to Catherine; or, coming nearer to&#xD;
the present moment, talked with Ida about fier feminine&#xD;
shrinking from appearing upon the stage. Frank listened in&#xD;
the deepest trouble, and in the wandering of her mind he&#xD;
learned much that had transpired at White Cliffs, a great deal&#xD;
that had occurred since her flight thence, and all that he&#xD;
ought to have known.&#xD;

When the physician arrived in the evening, he instituted&#xD;
strict inquiries, and discovered the cause of her high fever.&#xD;
Then he rebuked the indiscretion of her friends, and leaving&#xD;
fresh prescriptions, with peremptory orders that the deepest&#xD;
quiet should be preserved, departed. Her fever unabated&#xD;
raged all night. In the morning it went off.&#xD;
Captain Fairfax would not permit himself to enter her&#xD;
room again until he had obtained the power of perfect self-&#xD;
control. At about eleven o'clock he went in. The crimson&#xD;
curtains of the windows were drawn aside, an&amp;amp; the room was&#xD;
light and cheerful. The white muslin drapery of the bedstead&#xD;
was festooned, and revealed the fair invalid reclining there,&#xD;
wan, placid, child-like as ever. She welcomed her husband&#xD;
with the same soft, faint smile. And he went and sat by her&#xD;
side, and crushing down all strong emotions, took her hand,&#xD;
and spoke to her calmly and pleasantly, inquiring how she&#xD;
felt.&#xD;
"So well-it is so nice to be here," she answered simply.&#xD;
And she lay there looking at him contentedly, smiling softly,&#xD;
answering vaguely when he spoke to her; but never asking&#xD;
any question; or making any comment; or volunteering any&#xD;
speech whatever. This pained him more than all-for he&#xD;
knew that mind as well as body was sinking-lapsing away&#xD;
into a sort of dreamy, happy fatuity. And all attempts to&#xD;
rouse her from that state only threw her into fever, and&#xD;
often into delirium.&#xD;
One day, with a view to interest without exiting her, he&#xD;
inquired-&#xD;
"Dearest, is there any one you would like to see ~"&#xD;
"Yes-Ida," she said.&#xD;
"And who is Ida, love !" asked Frank, very cautiously&#xD;
and gently, for he felt as if he were running the risk of&#xD;
hurting her again.&#xD;
"Ida! La! don't you know ~ She was so good to me,&#xD;
she replied, with a pitying smile.&#xD;
Captain Fairfax left the room, and at a venture went over&#xD;
to inquire at the cabinet-maker's. And he soon returned,&#xD;
accompanied by Mrs. Knight. Zuleime received her visitor&#xD;
without any emotion whatever; smiling gently, and holding&#xD;
out her hand, and afterwards lying and silently and pleasantly&#xD;
watching her as she sat by the bed. And when she arose to&#xD;
take leave, she put up her lips for a kiss. Poor Ida pressed&#xD;

&#xD;
those lips very gently, and then quietly left the room; but&#xD;
as soon as she had passed the door, burst into tears.&#xD;
Every day Zuleinie's mind flowed away. Every day she&#xD;
became more infantile in weakness and simplicity. One day&#xD;
she made known a wish-the only one she had ever volun-&#xD;
tarily expressed. It was affecting from its utter childishness.&#xD;
"Dear Frank, you and your mother are rich. I want&#xD;
you to bring Ida an4 her child home to live here, so that she&#xD;
may not have to go on the stage any more." She reverted&#xD;
to this subject so frequently, repeating this, the only wish&#xD;
she had ever expressed, so often and earnestly, that her hus-&#xD;
band felt strongly inclined to gratify her desire, strange as&#xD;
it really was. He consulted his mother, and they concluded&#xD;
that it might be done, in a measure. Then they told her&#xD;
that it should be as she wished; that Ida and her child should&#xD;
come and live with them, if she would. Captain Fairfax&#xD;
went agti~n to the cabinet-maker's, saw the poor actress, and&#xD;
told her that his wife needed a female companion to sit with&#xD;
her a portion of the day, and that she would hear of no one&#xD;
for the post but her old friend, Mrs. Knight, if Mrs. Knight&#xD;
would come and name her own salary. And when he had&#xD;
let slip that last wordy he turned away his face with his fore-&#xD;
head burning under the astonished, indignant gaze of those&#xD;
proud, dark eyes of Ida's, as she said-&#xD;
"Captain Fairfax, II receive a 'salary' in the regular line&#xD;
of my profession, when I am engaged in it; as Captain&#xD;
Fairfax also receives pay for his military services-but as he&#xD;
would spurn all offers of pecuniary remuneration for atten-&#xD;
tions to 'a #wounded comrade, so should I decline all compen-&#xD;
sation for attentions to a sick neighbor; and- I am most&#xD;
surprised that you should have made such a proposal to me."&#xD;
So was Captain Fairfax himself really surprised that he&#xD;
should have been betrayed into such an error, as to forget&#xD;
that the very profession of the poor tragic actress really fos-&#xD;
tered a morbid pride. Her phrases might have been a little&#xD;
stilted after the manner of the stage, but the sentiments were&#xD;
really true and high, and worthy of all consideration. So Cap-&#xD;
tain Fairfax apologized, as he best could, and ai~ose to take&#xD;
his leave. Then she said-.~-&#xD;
"Do not quite misunderstand me. I am very anxious to&#xD;
do all in my power to serve Mrs. Fairfax, for I love her&#xD;
dearly! II am willingjo devote all my time, night and day,&#xD;
to her service, for the affection I bear her. And I can do it&#xD;
&#xD;
now; for since the burning of the theatre I have been dis-&#xD;
engaged."&#xD;
Captain Fairfax replied by expressing his grateful ac-&#xD;
knowledgments of her kindness, and beggihg her to come&#xD;
over frequently to see his wife. Then he took leave, indeed&#xD;
and returned home, with the determination to ask his mother&#xD;
to go and invite Mrs. Knight to come and spend a few weeks&#xD;
with her friend at Fairview House. Old Mrs. Fairfax bad&#xD;
quite a struggle with her Virginian prid&amp;amp; and prejudices, be-&#xD;
fore she could make up her mind to ask an actress to become&#xD;
her gttest, but benevolence conquered, and as whatever she&#xD;
once resolved upon doing she did graciously and gracefully,&#xD;
she called upon Mrs. Knight, and gave her the invitation in&#xD;
a manner that insured its* acceptance. Ida, with her little&#xD;
girl, came over the next day. And the old lady felt fully&#xD;
i2ewarded for her self-conquest, when she saw the smile of&#xD;
childish delight with which the gentle patient greeted her&#xD;
poor friend.&#xD;
"See, Ida, murmured Zuleime, as her visitor seated her-&#xD;
self at the bedside, "see, Ida, we are both now in the nice&#xD;
house we used to look at so longingly from our poor, back&#xD;
windows." She paused from weakness, and then said, "I&#xD;
used to call it my Heaven, you know! Ah, I did not know&#xD;
it was really my Heaven. I did not know Frank had ever&#xD;
lived here-how strange!" She paused again, but this time&#xD;
from thought, as well as from exhaustion, and then she took&#xD;
breath and said again, "I never could make it out clearly,&#xD;
and it makes my head ache to try. iBut see, dear Ida. Look&#xD;
at the crimson windowwcuttains-don't you know they are&#xD;
the very same crimson curtains that used to throw the warm,&#xD;
red glow across the snow, when we used to sit at the back&#xD;
window and watch them, and almost envy the people that&#xD;
lived here 'i"&#xD;
"Yes, I know, but do not talk too much, darling."&#xD;
"I won't-but it is so strange. There, look through the.&#xD;
windows, you can see our little, narrow, pinched, back win-&#xD;
dows, with their check curtains, as plainly from here, as we&#xD;
used to see these from there. We did not think we should&#xD;
ever get here to live, did we i-how strange !"&#xD;
Her talk, rambling as it was, revealed one hopeful fact-&#xD;
that her mind was at length waking up. Frank saw it with&#xD;
joy. Day by day, from this time, her intellect seemed to&#xD;

&#xD;
clear and strengthen. Frank spoke of this to the doctor,&#xD;
who heard him with great gravity, and without comment.&#xD;
As winter advanced towards spring, her mind "brightened&#xD;
more and more towards the perfect day." She had gleaned,&#xD;
partly from scraps of speech carelessly dropped, and partly&#xD;
by inquiry, the history of Frank's captivity among the Shos-&#xD;
honowas, that first originated the report of his death-and&#xD;
she was very gradually brought to understand the true posi-&#xD;
tion of affairs-so gradually through so many weeks, that&#xD;
the knowledge may be said rather to have slowly grown upon&#xD;
her. But as her mind cleared and strengthened, her heart&#xD;
became saddened and depressed. She understood too much&#xD;
now for her happiness. She no longer lay and watched her&#xD;
husband with a delighted smile as he sat beside her bed-.&#xD;
- no, but rather with a look of earnest, mournful love. Well&#xD;
she might. Frank was sad enough-he thought his heart&#xD;
was breaking.&#xD;
One day, while lying propped up by pillows, she heard the&#xD;
name of Mrs. Georgia Clifton mentioned.&#xD;
"Is she in the city ?" inquired she.&#xD;
"Yes, love," replied her husband.&#xD;
"Send fbr her to come and see me-I must see her."&#xD;
Captain Fairfax arose and left the room immediately, and&#xD;
instead of sending a servant, went himself to bring Mrs.&#xD;
Georgia. For so great was his desire to gratify promptly&#xD;
every wish of his loved one's heart, that he seldom trusted&#xD;
the execution of them to apy but himself, lest they should&#xD;
fail or be delayed. It was well in this instance, at least,&#xD;
that he went in person. A servant could not have effected&#xD;
the purpose. The conscience-stricken Georgia would not&#xD;
have ventured to come. Even when unannounced) by rea-&#xD;
son of this haste, Captain Fairfax entered her parlor, the&#xD;
beauty turned deadly pale, under the fear of detected guilt.&#xD;
But when she saw his calm, kind manner, and heard him en-&#xD;
treat, as a favor, that she would put on her bonnet imme-&#xD;
diately, and return with him to see his wife, who was&#xD;
extremely ill at Fairview, the sorceress was re-assured, and&#xD;
with her usual bewitching grace consented to accompany&#xD;
him.&#xD;
When they arrived at Fairview House, and were shown&#xD;
up into the sick chamber, the patient smiled and held out her&#xD;
hands. Georgia hastened towards her, and seized both hands,&#xD;
covering them with kisses, and making a show of great emo-&#xD;
&#xD;
tion. Zuleime raised her feeble voice, and begged all to go&#xD;
out of the room, and leave her alone with her visitor. And&#xD;
when every one had departed, and the door was closed, she&#xD;
said--&#xD;
"Sit down, please, here by my bedside." Mrs. Georgia&#xD;
took the nurse's arm-chair. "Dear Georgia," she said,&#xD;
gently taking both her hands, and looking kindly in her face,&#xD;
"I sent for you, because I thought you must be so unhappy&#xD;
about what you have unintentionally caused me to suffer.&#xD;
And I wished to tell you not to remember it in bitterness&#xD;
any more. Oh! I grieve so much at the memory of what I&#xD;
have made my dear father suffer, that I can feel for others&#xD;
who are tortured by remorse, and I would not, for the whole&#xD;
world, that any one should mourn for what they have caused&#xD;
me to suffer. So, dear Georgia, I acquit you ot~ allj blame,&#xD;
from the bottom of my heart, indeed I do-and I pray that&#xD;
God may make you happier than I have ever ~been. And I&#xD;
will never, never drop a hint, by which any one shall sus-&#xD;
pect-I mean I will never let fall a word to any one, that&#xD;
shall injure you, Georgia. I would not die and bequeath&#xD;
you so bitter a legacy as an enemy. Though I knew you&#xD;
would not come and ask me, I sent for you to assure you of&#xD;
this, Georgia, and to reconcile myself with you, that we might&#xD;
be friends before I die. And now, God bless you! Kiss me,&#xD;
and say good-bye, for my fever is rising.&#xD;
And she held up her lips. Georgia was weeping.&#xD;
"Zuleime, my dear child, why don't you call me, mamma~&#xD;
as heretofore V' she asked.&#xD;
"Oh, don't you know long ago you told me not to do it:&#xD;
But I will, if you wish it, now. Kiss me, dear mamma.&#xD;
There, now, go and be at peace.&#xD;
Georgia hurried from the room. They never met again.&#xD;
Zuleime revived slightly when the spring opened~ She&#xD;
had heard that her sister Carolyn had nearly recovered her&#xD;
health, and was just about to set out on her voyage home.&#xD;
And two secret wishes the poor girl indulged: once more to&#xD;
visit White Cliffs, and to live to see her only sister' again.&#xD;
flut she kept them to herself in the fear of giving Frank&#xD;
trouble, for she knew that he would try to move Heaven and&#xD;
earth to please her, and deeply grieve if he should fail. She&#xD;
concealed her wants, but they were discovered by him who&#xD;
watched day and night to anticipate her wishes. 'And Cap-&#xD;
tain Fairfax called upon the fiunily physician, and consulted&#xD;

&#xD;
him upon 'the possibility of taking Zuleime to White Cliffs,&#xD;
as soon as the spring weather should be permanently settled.&#xD;
The physician's opinion was highly favorable to his wishes.&#xD;
lie said that she might be removed by easy stages to the&#xD;
country, and that if proper care and attention were bestowed,&#xD;
the Journey and the change of air would probably be found&#xD;
very beneficial to her health. Captain Fairfax hastened&#xD;
home to cheer his wife with the news. And she was glad~&#xD;
dened by it. She caught both his hauds and kissed them,&#xD;
and held them to her face, and looking at him fondly, said-.&#xD;
"Dear Frank! dearest Frank! you try to perform mira-&#xD;
cles for me ~&#xD;
The same night, Captain Fairfax wrote to Mrs. Clifton, of&#xD;
]Iiardbargain,. to go over to White Cliffs and prepare to re-&#xD;
ceive the invalid. And from that day Zuleinje revived, and&#xD;
by the first of June was so much better, as to be able to be&#xD;
placed in th. comfortable family carriage, in which, some-&#xD;
times reclining upon downy cushions, sometimes resting upon&#xD;
the bosom of her husband, and supported by his arms, she&#xD;
traveled by easy stages to White Oliffs. They reached the&#xD;
end of their journey upon the afternoon of the third day.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton and Catherine were there to receive them. Zu-&#xD;
leime was lifted out of the carriage, very much exhausted.&#xD;
Yet, as she was gently carried through the yard, her eyes&#xD;
roved gladly over all the dear familiar scene-over moun-&#xD;
tains, fields and forests, clothed now in the luxuriant foliage&#xD;
of June-and all her countenance lighted up with joy, and&#xD;
she exclaimed many times in tones of profound gratitude-&#xD;
"Thank, God! oh, thank God!"&#xD;
She was carried up stairs, and put to bed at once. And&#xD;
Catherine was stationed to watch her slumbers, while Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton remained below to attend ~o the comfort of the tired&#xD;
travelers. But Ziileime frequently awoke with a joyful start&#xD;
and recollection; and once she put her hand in that of Kate,&#xD;
and said-&#xD;
"Dear Kate! blessed Kate! I am so glad to see you&#xD;
again! An&amp;amp;so very glad to be home again! Sweet Sister&#xD;
of Mercy! will you stay and nurse me also? I think you&#xD;
could ahnos~ cure me! Sweet, unprocessed nun, will you&#xD;
stay and nur~e me, too ?"&#xD;
"Yes, dear Zuleime, I will stay as long as you want me.&#xD;
But shut those tired eyes, love, and go to sleep."&#xD;
"Yes, 'seal each eyelid down with a kiss, dear Kate, and&#xD;
&#xD;
89&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
then they will stay closed. And hold my hand as I go to&#xD;
sleep-I feel so safe when some one I love holds my hand&#xD;
while I slumber. I feel as if they could keep me in life while&#xD;
I slept, for you must know, dear 'Kate, that my heart has a&#xD;
morbid action, and some of these days I shall fall asleep&#xD;
lightly as now, but never awake again.&#xD;
"Dear Zuleime, you must not indulge such fancies."&#xD;
"They are not fancies, they are realities. I do not de-&#xD;
ceive myself and trifle with you, Kate. Do not you deceive&#xD;
me or trifle with me, either. There are secrets of life and&#xD;
death known only to the dying. Such a secret is mine. I.&#xD;
know that I shall lightly drop asleep some day, and never&#xD;
wake again-that is the reason I wish some one I love to kiss&#xD;
my eyelids down, and to hold my hand while I slumber."&#xD;
The words, the manner of the dying girl carried deep con-&#xD;
viction to the heart of Catherine, and.-.-&#xD;
"Oh! Zuleime," she said, "lean upon the failing arm&#xD;
of flesh if you will, but, oh, seek! seek the support of&#xD;
that Almighty arm that can sustain you in life and in death!&#xD;
Seek that !"&#xD;
"I will-I wish to do it, or rather you, the handmaid of&#xD;
the Lord, shall bear me up in yvur .faithful hands, and lay&#xD;
me within that Arm of Strength. I wished this long agc~,&#xD;
but, oh, my dear husband and his good mother! they thought&#xD;
only of restoring me to health, and I could think of nothing&#xD;
but of trying to live for them, until very lately, when it was&#xD;
revealed to me that I should surely die. I have' never yet&#xD;
told Frank anything about this. I feared it would distress&#xD;
him too much; but the lone knowledge troubled me. I&#xD;
needed to tell some one of it, some dear one with whom I&#xD;
could converse confidentially, and who should be wise enough&#xD;
to counsel me, patient enough to bear with me, courageous&#xD;
enough to face the result, and who, besides, would not be too&#xD;
greatly distressed, as my hear husband would. And so,&#xD;
sweet Kate, I have told you. Will you now stay with me&#xD;
and nurse me&#xD;
"Yes, dear Zuleime, as long as you wish me to do so; but&#xD;
now, darling, if I am to be your nurse, you must mind what&#xD;
INhave to say to you, and go to sleep." Catherine bent over&#xD;
her, and kissed her eyelids down upon the. weary eyes, and&#xD;
held her hand until she fell asleep. At night, Captain Fair-&#xD;
fax relieved her watch.&#xD;
The next morning when Catherine entered the roo~m she&#xD;

sat down by the side of the bed, and told her that ~she had&#xD;
good news to tell, that they had received a letter from Major&#xD;
Clifton, that Carolyn's health was improving, and that they&#xD;
had embarked, or had purposed to embark upon the first of&#xD;
May, and expected to reach home as soon as the middle of&#xD;
June. Zuleime clasped her hands in fervent thanksgiving&#xD;
while she' listened, and when her friend ceased to speak, she&#xD;
exclaimed~&#xD;
"In two weeks she will be here.-oh! that I may live to&#xD;
see it !"&#xD;
Kate bade her be of good cheer and hope; and when&#xD;
Catherine told any one to hope, her words and looks and&#xD;
manner all inspired ~the feeling. Zuleiine was so recovered&#xD;
and enlivene~ as to be able to be lifted from her bed and&#xD;
placed in the easy-chair by the open window, that looked out&#xD;
upon the mountain scenery, 411 glorious in the light of sum-&#xD;
mer morning. Old Mrs. Fairfax, and Mrs. Clifton of Hard-&#xD;
bargain, came in to pay her a visit, bringing her little girl&#xD;
with them. As for Captain Fairfax, he seldom left her side.&#xD;
All congratulated the invalid upon her improved health and&#xD;
spirits, and hoped and foretold great results from her resi-&#xD;
dence in the country, and projected many pleasant drives,&#xD;
when she should be a little rested from the fatigue of her&#xD;
journey. Then they talked of 'Major Clifton and Carolyn's&#xD;
expected arrival, and laid out extensive plans of amusement&#xD;
to be put in execution when they should come, by which time&#xD;
Zuleime also would be considerably restored. Thus cheer..&#xD;
fully, hopefully they talked. And the dying one listened&#xD;
sweetly ; ~but when she found herself alone again with Kate,&#xD;
she said-.&#xD;
"I let them talk, Catherine, for if they really have any&#xD;
hopes of my recovery, I do not wish to destroy those hopes&#xD;
by telling what I know, and if they only talk so to cheer me,&#xD;
why even then I do not like to make them sad by not seem-&#xD;
ing to believe them. And yet, and yet, perhaps I ought to&#xD;
tell Frank; perhaps I will !"&#xD;
Catherine devoted herself to the service of the invalid,&#xD;
laboring zealously for her spiritual as for her bodily good.&#xD;
Indeed, the girl glided into the performance of such duties as&#xD;
naturally as if she felt herself especially called to the work,&#xD;
born for the work. The selfish ~Vish for her own comfort and&#xD;
pleasure had never been very strong in the heart of Cathe~&#xD;
rine; 4nd within the last two years it seemed to have ex-&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
pired. She lived only for the good of others. She had grown&#xD;
to believe that there was no individual happiness for herself,&#xD;
except in the service of others. Young hope had died out in&#xD;
her heart, she was resigned. She adopted the submissive&#xD;
words of Mary and her Son, and said, within her heart, in&#xD;
deepest sincerity-&#xD;
"Behold, the handmaid of the Lord." "Not my will, but&#xD;
Thine, oh God."&#xD;
Zuleime was lifted from the bed to the easy-chair every&#xD;
morning, and calmly and profoundly the invalid enjoyed those&#xD;
glorious summer mornings. But she was failing very fast.&#xD;
She grew very anxious for the coming of her sister; but, un-&#xD;
willing to disturb any one by her anxiety, she confided it&#xD;
only to Kate. They had not heard from Major Clifton since&#xD;
the letter announcing his expected embarkation. They justly&#xD;
supposed him to be on his voyage home, accompanied by&#xD;
Carolyn, and were now daily looking for a letter announcing&#xD;
their landing, and their speedy arrival home. The middle of&#xD;
June passed, and no letter had comet The first of July ar-&#xD;
rived, but brought no news of the voyagers.&#xD;
"Oh, if they had come when they promised, they might&#xD;
have seen me before I died-but I cannot hold out much&#xD;
longer, Kate. I feel as if the longing to meet Carolyn again&#xD;
had kept me up as by the excitement of expectation, but,&#xD;
Kate, I feel very weary, very much inclined to droop, yet&#xD;
know if I should give way I should drop into the arms of&#xD;
Death. I wish they would come. I want to see Carolyn. I&#xD;
want to see her happiness with my own eyes. And then it&#xD;
is not for myself-for if I die before she comes, Carolyn will&#xD;
take it very much to heart to know that her poor little sister&#xD;
had been found and had died-so inopportunely, just before&#xD;
she had got home. I wish they would come."&#xD;
The second week in July arrived---with three days of cloud,&#xD;
and rain, and gloom. Zuleime could not leave her bed for&#xD;
her favorite seat at the window, but Catherine served her&#xD;
with more love and zeal than ever. The family had as yet&#xD;
received no news of the travelers, and though they daily&#xD;
grew more anxious, there was no foreboding in their anxiety.&#xD;
Sea-voyages at that day were of such uncertain length. All&#xD;
was no doubt well.&#xD;
But on the evening of the second rainy day, while Captain&#xD;
Fairfax and Catherine sat with Zuleime, and all tho other&#xD;
members of the family were assembled in the summer saloon,&#xD;

the door of the latter was quietly opened, and Major Clifton&#xD;
stood before the astonished circle. His mother advanced to&#xD;
meet and welcome him. Then she noticed-and they all no~&#xD;
ticed, that he was clothed in deep mourning. That told the&#xD;
tale! They welcomed him with affectionate sympathy, but&#xD;
no one asked a question. Nor did he as yet volunteer a word&#xD;

valescence of his wife-how from the day of their embarka-&#xD;
tion her strength declined-how for weeks their hearts fluc-&#xD;
tuated betWeen hope and fear, as with the changes of her&#xD;
flattering disease she seemed better or worse-how when all&#xD;
thought of life was gone, but one earthly hope possessed her&#xD;
soul-to die at home ;-of the waning of that last hope-of&#xD;
the death i~t sea-and, finally, of the lone grave in the ocean&#xD;
isle, where slept the mortal remains of the haughtiest beauty&#xD;
that ever trod the halls of a palace.&#xD;
They would willingly have concealed the fact of her sis-&#xD;
ter's deceased from the dying girl-no one ventured to tell&#xD;
her of the event-they fondly believed that she remained in&#xD;
ignorance of it. But she knew it all from what she saw and&#xD;
heard. She knew that Major Clifton h~d returned alone, and&#xD;
she surmised the rest from the sad and tearful faces of all&#xD;
around her. Yes, she knew it all, as well as any could have&#xD;
made~ her know it, and in the tender thoughtfulness of her&#xD;
soul, she would not distress any by asking them questions&#xD;
relating to the last moment. But from this hour she sank&#xD;
rapidly. She could no. longer be lifted from her bed without,&#xD;
fainting~ In deep trouble, Captain Fairfax summoned the&#xD;
old family physician. When he came, and saw the patient,&#xD;
his opinion was decidedly formed, and truthfully given-he&#xD;
said that the Richmond physician had evidently abandoned&#xD;
the case as hopeless, when he sent her home to die-that her&#xD;
life had probably been prolonged by her residence in the&#xD;
country.-.-but that nothing could have saved her-and that&#xD;
she had now not niany days to live. Captain Fairfax was&#xD;
almost mad with grief-and all the self-possession and self-&#xD;
control that he had learned in the long attendance ~1pon her&#xD;
sick bed well nigh deserted him. It was many hours before&#xD;
he was sufficiently composed to take his usual place by her&#xD;
bedside, and then his agonized countenance betrayed the ex-&#xD;
tent of his suffering. Catherine was sitting by her when he&#xD;
entered. Zuleime raised her dying eyes, and looking a~t him,&#xD;
&#xD;
tenderly beckoned him to approach. Then she motioned&#xD;
Catherine to leave her. When they were alone-she laid her&#xD;
hand within his own, and looking at him with unutterable&#xD;
love, said-&#xD;
"Dear Frank-dearest Frank-I see that you know it all&#xD;
at last. Dearest Frank, I have known it a long time. Now&#xD;
let us talk freely and confidentially about it-let there be no&#xD;
more of that painful mist between us as when you thought only&#xD;
of my restoration to health, and I knew I was sinking fast&#xD;
into the grave." She paused a moment, and then said-" I&#xD;
want so much to comfort you. I have something to say to&#xD;
you.&#xD;
his fingers closed upon her hand convulsively. He choked&#xD;
down his strong, rising emotion, and said-&#xD;
"Do not try to talk, love, the effort will exhaust your&#xD;
strength."&#xD;
"No-no, it will not. I am not so weak as I was when&#xD;
you came in. Dearest Frank, when you sit by me, and hold&#xD;
my hand, new life seems to run up my feeble veins, and I&#xD;
feel stronger. Let me talk, love. Ah! do not look so sad!&#xD;
It is better as it is, love. It is better I should go. I have&#xD;
spoiled my own life, and should spoil yours if I should live.&#xD;
Ah, it is a dreadful thing to occasion the death of any one!&#xD;
it is an awful thing to cause the death of a father. I caused&#xD;
the death of the most loving father that ever lived. And,&#xD;
dearest Frank! though in the struggle, in the bitterness of&#xD;
poverty, in the pangs of hunger and of cold, and in the pain&#xD;
and debility of illness, the feeling of compunction has been&#xD;
diverted, yet-had health returned with prosperity-remorse&#xD;
would then have darkened all my life; and in ruining my&#xD;
happiness, would have marred yours. Yes! I have spoiled&#xD;
my own life. It is well that I should not live to spoil yours,&#xD;
dearest Frank! I talk not of expiation now. Nothing that&#xD;
I could do or suffer, would alter the irrevocable past. We&#xD;
have all one Redeemer-Jesus Christ the Righteous. So I&#xD;
talk not of expiating the past; though perhaps if any heart&#xD;
is hardened against me, my early death may soften it. But&#xD;
let me speak of the future-your future, dearest Frank, and&#xD;
let me say it is better for all your coming years that I should&#xD;
die."&#xD;
"Oh, do not say so, Zuleime-you break my heart."&#xD;
"Dear Frank, you will grieve for me, I know you will;&#xD;
but be comforted. You are so young yet. This sorrow will&#xD;

pass like a morning cloud, and leave all your life a long&#xD;

darkly over her face and vanished, lie did not see~ it, his&#xD;
face was buried in his hands. Then she asked to have her&#xD;
child brought to her. Frank went out, but soon returned to&#xD;
say that little Fan had been put to bed; and to ~sk her if&#xD;
the child should be waked up. "No, do not wake the poor,&#xD;
little thing," she said, and then added, "I am very, very&#xD;
sleepy, Frank; dearest Frank, kiss my eyelids down to&#xD;
slumber like you always do, and hold my hand till I fall&#xD;
asleep. Kiss my lips, too, this time; kiss them last of all-.&#xD;
-there-good-night, love." Her voice sank away in a low,&#xD;
inaudible murmur, Like a dying sound on the Eolian harp.&#xD;
Her husband sat and held her hand, never moving, scarcely&#xD;
breathing, lest he should disturb her long, deep sleep. He&#xD;
sat there more than an hour. The room grew dark with the&#xD;
shades of evening; and when at length Catherine entered&#xD;
with the night lamp, he raised his hand with a sign of silence&#xD;
and caution, murmuring-&#xD;
"She has fallen asleep~" Catherine approached quietly,&#xD;
shading~the lamp with her hand, and looked upon the sleeper.&#xD;
"Hush, be very cautious-.-do not disturb her," whispered&#xD;
Frank.&#xD;
The sweet and solemn voice of Catherine gently arose, say-&#xD;
ing, "Come away, Captain FairfaL Nothing will ever disturb&#xD;
her more. She has fallen asleep in Je8us."&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;

The serpent now began to change'&#xD;
Her elfin blood in madness ran.-kEA~rs.&#xD;
Two months have passed since the death of the sisters.&#xD;
To the consternation of the ha~tt toiz of the city, the beautiful&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton has left Richmond, and come down to mourn&#xD;
with those that mourn at White Cliffs. With an air at once&#xD;
of earnest conviction and graceful weariness, she says that it&#xD;
is "All vanity and vexation of spirit," meaning fashionable&#xD;
society, spring traveling, and sight seeing; summers at wa-&#xD;
tering-places among the mountains, or by the sea-side; win-&#xD;
ters in town, with plays, concerts, balls, dressing, visiting and&#xD;
waltzing; autumn parties in the country-houses, with eques-&#xD;
trian expeditions, sailing excursions, and forest rides and&#xD;
drives, and even the moonlight serenades, and "the slight&#xD;
flirtation by the light of the chandelier." Mrs. Georgia&#xD;
speaks the truth. "Vanity" all this undoubtedly is in her.&#xD;
But entrees nous, the "vexation of spirit" appertains to cer~&#xD;
tam "small" accounts, ranging from fifty to fifteen hundred&#xD;
dollars, and sent in by landlords, merchants, jewelers, mil-&#xD;
liners, etc., people so wanting in delicate perception, as not&#xD;
to see that the honor of the belle's custom was quite payment&#xD;
enough in itself for their goods, and so utterly destitute of&#xD;
classic lore, and the faculty of distinguishing persons, as&#xD;
actually to draw out on a piece of paper a list of items oppo-&#xD;
site to a row of figures, with a sum total at the bottom, and&#xD;
send it to a Circe, as if she were a tradesman, and could un-&#xD;
derstand it! -Charming Georgia did not even try to compre-&#xD;
hend such mysterious hieroglyphics. She knew, bewitching&#xD;
creature! that "where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be&#xD;
wise." Therefore, to escape duns, to recruit health and&#xD;
spirits, and, of all things, to console Major Clifton, she has&#xD;
co~ne down to White Cliffs. The beautiful Georgia presented&#xD;

herself to the mourning master of White Cliffs in a very de-&#xD;
precating spirit-she said that she felt her arrival there at&#xD;
such a moment to be almost an intrusion, but that he would&#xD;
excuse it, as she had exhausted money and credit, and had no&#xD;
other home.&#xD;
"You know," she added, as the tears suffused her large,&#xD;
dark eyes, "I am like the unjust steward of the parable, 'II&#xD;
cannot work-to beg I am ashamed.'"&#xD;
"Except instead of being unjust, you suffer from the in-&#xD;
justice of others," said Archer Clifton, very gently. lie&#xD;
said that he considered the entail, which cut off the widow&#xD;
from any share in the landed estate of her deceased husband,&#xD;
very unjust and cruel. He knew that his uncle had deeply&#xD;
regretted it, and would have left all his personal property to&#xD;
her, had it not been swallowed up by debt. He said that he&#xD;
himself deplored the circumstance, and if it wefb legally in&#xD;
his power, he would ~divide the land with her, but that he&#xD;
only held it in entail, and as entire as it came to him it must&#xD;
be held for his heirs. He added, that he considered it his&#xD;
duty to compensate his uncle's widow for the injustice of the&#xD;
law to her, and that the case being so, she would find thirty&#xD;
thousand dollars placed to her account in the Bank of Rich-&#xD;
inond., Mrs. Georgia was overcome with emotion at this&#xD;
generosity on the part of Major Clifton. She put hei~ hand-&#xD;
kerchief to her eyes, and arose hurriedly, with every mark&#xD;
of extreme agitation, exclaiming-&#xD;
"No, no-this is too much! too good! only lend me the&#xD;
shelter of this roof-once my home-until I look about me&#xD;
and consider what to do."&#xD;
He took her hand, with every demonstration of the ten-&#xD;
derest affection and respect, and pressed it to his lips, and&#xD;
begged her to consider herself as heretofore, mistress of the&#xD;
establishment for as long as she wished-for her whole life,&#xD;
if she pleased-and himself only as her sometime guest-&#xD;
adding, that it was impossible he should ever bring another&#xD;
lady there. She withdrew her handkerchief from her eyes,&#xD;
and glancing at him with a countenance eloquent with grati-&#xD;
tude, respect, and affection, exclaimed-~&#xD;
"1 take a large portion of your personal property, and I&#xD;
turn you from your home! Oh! no, no, no, thou thrice&#xD;
noble and generous man,, no! Not one dollar of that money&#xD;
will I touch, so help me Heaven! And not one hour will I&#xD;
stay under this roof, if the master of the house is to he only&#xD;
&#xD;
my 'sometime guest!' No! I-I-I must go back to the&#xD;
city, and give lessons in drawing and painting, as befits the&#xD;
artist's daughter."&#xD;
"And as does not befit my uncle's widow, lady !" said&#xD;
Archer Clifton, again taking her hand. "I have considered&#xD;
myself in some sort your guardian and protector-if you will&#xD;
admit the claim. Now, listen to me calmly, and act reason-&#xD;
ably, for we of White Cliffs are not accustomed to be opposed&#xD;
by the ladies of our family. Hear me, then: This money,&#xD;
which I have placed to your account, is rightfully yours. I&#xD;
will explain. It was the fortune of my dearest Carolyn-"&#xD;
here his voice faltered, he paused a moment, during which&#xD;
Georgia pressed his hand, and looked in his face with an ex-&#xD;
pression of unspeakable sympathy-then he resumed, calmly,&#xD;
"Had she died unmarried, and during her father's lifetime,&#xD;
this money would have reverted to him, and he would doubt-&#xD;
less have left it to you. I only give you that which, but for&#xD;
me, might have reached you more directly. And now let&#xD;
that subject rest forever."&#xD;
"Ab, but best and most generous of friends, I drive you&#xD;
from your home by staying here! I cannot stay! I must&#xD;
depart!"&#xD;
"You must not, Mrs. Clifton-this is your proper home,&#xD;
as it is also mine. You do not drive me hence-why should&#xD;
you ~ Could I possibly remain, your company would be the&#xD;
dearest solace I could have. No! it is memory that drives&#xD;
me hence, sweet friend! I must-I must forget myself m~m&#xD;
distant lands! Forgive me for talking thus-to be quite&#xD;
plain, as soon as the intricate affairs of this estate are disen-&#xD;
tangled, and wound up, I design to set out for two or three&#xD;
years of travel; yet I shall not be able to get off for several&#xD;
weeks."&#xD;
Here the conversation ended for the present. Thinking&#xD;
that for the first few days, at least, Mrs. ~eorgma would need&#xD;
a female companion, lie got in his chaise, and went over to&#xD;
Hardbargain for Catherine.&#xD;
"Kate is not here," said Mrs. Clifton, in answer to his&#xD;
inquiries-" do you not know that she has been for three&#xD;
weeks at her brother's cabin, nursing his wife through her&#xD;
confinement 'P'&#xD;
Major Clifton threw his hat upon the table, and dropped&#xD;
himself into a chair, with an air of extreme vexation, say~&#xD;

THE OLIItSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
* "It really seems to me that that girl is nurse and ser-&#xD;
vant-in-general to the neighborhood! Her brother might&#xD;
easily have found some old wpman to nurse his wife. I won-&#xD;
der you permit her to be made such a slave of by everybody,&#xD;
mother."&#xD;
"It does her no harm, Archer."&#xD;
"Twelve months since you introduced Catherine into the&#xD;
best society in Richmond."&#xD;
"The richest, you mean--not the best, by a great deal."&#xD;
"And now you suffer her to throw herself into the most&#xD;
vulgar and common! Dear madam, is this right '?"&#xD;
"'What God hath cleansed, call not thou common, or&#xD;
unclean '-yes! it is right! Catherine, a girl of the very hum-&#xD;
blest birth, with natural talent and acquired accomplishments&#xD;
that fit her for any circle-should mix with all. And,&#xD;
Archer, what do you mean by 'vulgar P If ignoble minds,&#xD;
corrupt hearts, and mean actions constitute vulgarity.-.then&#xD;
I for one have met more vulgar people in so-called high-life&#xD;
than ever I saw in 1GW-life !"&#xD;
"My dear mother, you are a Republican-let us waive&#xD;
this discussion, for I dislike to differ from you, and tell ~ne&#xD;
where I shall find Catherine, for she positively must return&#xD;
with me to White Cliffs, to bear Mrs. Georgia company,&#xD;
until some other companion can be procured fo~ her."&#xD;
"Catheifine is at her brother's cabin, as I told you."&#xD;
"The same cabin he occupied before I left home P'&#xD;
"Certainly."&#xD;
Major Clifton entered the gig, and turned the horse's head&#xD;
towards the dell in which the overseer's cabin stood. When&#xD;
he drew up4 before the door, Carl came out to welcome him,&#xD;
and invite him to alight.&#xD;
"No, thank you, send Catherine hither," he said-&#xD;
Carl looked very much as though he did not intend to&#xD;
obey this haughty behest-but Catherine had already heard&#xD;
the demand, and appeared at the door.&#xD;
"How-do-you-do, Kate ~ Mrs. Georgia Clifton is at my&#xD;
house, and I wish you to return with me to attend upon her.&#xD;
Come, get your bonnet, at once, Catherine, for lam rather&#xD;
hurried."&#xD;
"We cannot spare Catherine, sir," said Carl, in a tone of&#xD;
displeasure.&#xD;
"I did not address myself to you, my good fellow," said&#xD;
Major Clifton, looking over his head, and through the door&#xD;

I                                                                                                                                                                                   4&#xD;
&#xD;
of the cabin, watching Catherine, as she tied on her&#xD;
bonnet.&#xD;
When Rate came out, he handed her into the gig, and&#xD;
nodding carelessly to the flushed, indignant Carl, drove off.&#xD;
When they had driven a little way-&#xD;
"Catherine," he said, "is that man your full brother ~"&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"The same father and mother 'P'&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Humph! You are not at all alike in feature. Are you&#xD;
very much attached to this brother, Catherine P'&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Humph." He did not speak again until they had&#xD;
reached White Cliffs, when he handed her out, and said-.-..&#xD;
"Catherine, Mrs. Georgia is greatly fatigued; I wish you to&#xD;
attend to her comforts, this evening-do you bear V'&#xD;
"Yes, sir," replied Kate.&#xD;
The next day Mrs. Clifton, of Hardbargain, came over to&#xD;
call on Georgia. And afterwards, at the earnest solicitation&#xD;
of her son, she paid them a visit of a week. Major Clifton&#xD;
busied himself with the settlement of the estate. Although&#xD;
the great debts of the late iflr. Clifton could not be recovered&#xD;
of him, he determined to pay them all. A great many of&#xD;
them he discharged at once, by cash; and in payment of&#xD;
others, he gave notes, bearing interest. The calling in of these&#xD;
numerous debts, and the arrangement of the terms of pay-&#xD;
ment, and other matters, occupied him nearly two months,&#xD;
so that it was the last of autumn before he was ready to set&#xD;
out on his journey.&#xD;
He had taken leave of his mother the evening previous to&#xD;
the day upon which he was to leave home. The next morn-&#xD;
ing, in parting from Mrs. Georgia and Catherine, he took&#xD;
leave of the lady, in a tender and respectful manner, raising&#xD;
her hand to his lips-but he drew Kate to his bosom, and&#xD;
pushing back the rippling waves of chestnut hair, that con-&#xD;
cealed or shaded two-thirds of her massive forehead, he said,&#xD;
gravely and sweetly-&#xD;
"What are you going to do with all this brain while I am&#xD;
gone, Kate ~ How much longer will it lie fallow ~ Well!&#xD;
Never mind !" He kissed her freely and fondly as a near&#xD;
relative might, and bowing once more to Mrs. Georgia, has-&#xD;
tened away. He paused upon the threshold of the door,&#xD;
however, seemed to hesitate, then-suddenly came back, seized&#xD;

the hand of Kate, and drew her out upon the porch. "Can&#xD;
therine," he said, "do 'you remember a promise you made me&#xD;
once-not to marry without my consent ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I remember it."&#xD;
"I hold you to that promise, Kate. I must speak plainly&#xD;
to you at the risk or the certainty of wounding your feelings;&#xD;
yours is a singular position, Catherine-a girl of humble&#xD;
birth, quite penniless, yet with education and accomplish~&#xD;
ments that fit her to grace a higher circle, It is not likely,&#xD;
Catherine, that any gentleman in this part of the country&#xD;
will ever become a suitor for your hand, and no one who is&#xD;
not a gentleman should be permitted to do so !-Therefore,&#xD;
Catherine, I wish you to promise me not to listen to any pre-&#xD;
posals without my~consent."&#xD;
"I promised you long ago, sir. I will keep that promise&#xD;
until you release me from it!'?&#xD;
"That is a good girl! Now, then, once more good-bye,"&#xD;
and again he folded her to his bosom, and then, indeed, he&#xD;
was gone.&#xD;
Catherine turned with the intention of seeking her own&#xD;
room, but was instantly confronted by Mrs. Georgia Clifton,&#xD;
who stood before her with pallid cheek, set teeth, and gleam-&#xD;
ing eyes. She caught the wrist of the girl, and keeping a&#xD;
strong, vice-like grasp upon it, dragged her almost with vio-&#xD;
lence into the parlor before the window, and casting herself&#xD;
into a chair, pulled Catherine up before her, and fixed those&#xD;
wild, dilated, star-like eyes upon her ~hce. It fell blushing&#xD;
under the gaze.&#xD;
"You love that wan," she said, drawing her breath hardly,&#xD;
like one iu a passing pain.&#xD;
The blush deepened upon Catherine's cheek, but she did&#xD;
not reply in words.&#xD;
"Speak! Answer me! You love that man ?" she re-&#xD;
peated, clutching the wrist of the girl so tightly as to cause&#xD;
her to wince.&#xD;
"Madam, I am grateful to Major Clifton-he is my bene-&#xD;
factor-he cares for me, and I am grateful to him."&#xD;
"lie is an arrogant man-he reminded you, of your low&#xD;
birth."&#xD;
"I know he did, madam, and perhaps II ought to have&#xD;
vindicated our common human future, and told him, as I&#xD;
tell you now, that there is no such thing in God's universe&#xD;
as low ,birth, that every child comes into His world with&#xD;

equal claim upon His people; perhaps it was my duty to&#xD;
have told him this, only I am always a coward before Major&#xD;
Clifton, and never can say the right thing at. the right time&#xD;
to him, as I can to others."&#xD;
"You love him! That is the reason And you are a&#xD;
fool if you do not know it, or a hypocrite if, knowing it, you&#xD;
deny it. But he despises your love! He said to you, him.&#xD;
self, that no gentleman would be likely to b~e a suitor for&#xD;
your hand !"&#xD;
"I know he did, lady. His care for me makes him say&#xD;
rough, blunt things sometimes. I can bear them from him."&#xD;
"You love him! ]I~eny it, if y~u dare! But you are an&#xD;
idiot! an idiot! if you do not take his hint to conquer that&#xD;
passion! He said it was not likely that any gentleman&#xD;
would ever become a suitor for your hand! lie is a gentle-&#xD;
man-therefore he can never stoop to you! You do not&#xD;
answer me! Do you,~perchance, deceive yourself with the&#xD;
idea that he ever will ?"&#xD;
"Lady-no, I do not deceive myself with the idea that&#xD;
he will ever 'stoop' to marry me. The woman that Major&#xD;
Clifton shall marry, if he ever marries, will be quite worthy&#xD;
of him, and that will preclude the idea of hi~ 'stooping' to&#xD;
her."&#xD;
"And that woman will not be you, presumptuous girl!&#xD;
Do you dare to hope it will ~ Speak! Answer me !"&#xD;
"Lady !" said Catherine, in a tone of grave and dignified&#xD;
rebuke, "considering the recent bereavement of Major Clif-&#xD;
ton, the discussion into which you have drawn me is indeli-~&#xD;
cate, to use no harsher term !"&#xD;
"'Recent!' It is of five months' standing! You evade&#xD;

any power in my own soul, on earth, in Heaven, or fri hell to&#xD;
help me, I will find it 'out, and enlist it to give me this one&#xD;
desire of my heart, this man's love! Since first I ever be-&#xD;
held his face, I have dreamed, hoped, toiled, lived for nothing&#xD;
else! I have suffered for him! Oh! angels and devils! how I&#xD;
have suffei9ed for him! In the days when he came wooing&#xD;
Carolyn, wooing her bt~fore the face of me, boun~l with indisso..&#xD;
luble chains !-me, loving him as she had no power or 'con-&#xD;
ception of loving anything! Many times I was almost mad with&#xD;
despair !-.--knowing, too, if he would only love me I should be&#xD;
nearly mad with joy!. I have sacrificed great prospects for&#xD;
him. Yes! little as you think me capable of it! This sum-&#xD;
mer I might have made a splendid alliance in Richmond~.....a&#xD;
traveling nobleman.......an English nobleman, girl! a baron with&#xD;
an annual rental of thirty thousand pounds ste1~iing-.....with&#xD;
seats in the three kingdoms, and a palace in Portman Square.&#xD;
I rejected him, when I knew that Clifton was free! In the&#xD;
faint hope of winning Clifton, I w6uld not bind myself. All&#xD;
that I have over done of good or of evil has had him for its&#xD;
end and object! I was thc~ belle, queen, idol of 1~ichinond!&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
If I schemed and toiled for a position, and gloried in my&#xD;
success, it was that he might hear of it, and his pride might&#xD;
be enlisted for me,! You saw me one winter at the governor's&#xD;
reception! You saw how I was worshiped there! But he&#xD;
was prcsent-and free, and I did not care what the thou-&#xD;
sands thought of me, I only cared what that unit might&#xD;
think !" Her voice sank into tenderness, and she paused,&#xD;
and dropped her brow into both open hands. But soon rais-&#xD;
ing her head again, she said, "Look at me well'! Ay,&#xD;
look!' What sort of a rival do you take me to be ~ If you&#xD;
cannot guess, I will tell you! I am not superstitiou~ or&#xD;
scrupulous, as you are! I am one, who, fey my soul's great&#xD;
passion, will do, or dare, or suffer anything! I ask no leave&#xD;
of earth or Heaven for what I do! I do what I will, or can.&#xD;
and take the consequences; earth or Heaven can but punish,&#xD;
and I can risk or bear it !-for there is no pain or loss in the&#xD;
universe that I weigh with the loss of my love! And not&#xD;
for the fear of eternal perdition-not for the hope of ever-&#xD;
lasting salvation, will I forego the joy of my mortal love!&#xD;
Now, hear me, girl !" She rose upon her feet, bending over&#xD;
Catherine, with her hand clutched upon the maiden's shoul-&#xD;
der with a vice-like grip, and, gazing into her eyes with con-&#xD;
tracted; gleaming pupils, she said,-while her voice dropped&#xD;
into the low, deep, stern tone of intense and concentrated&#xD;
passion, in which every word, syllable, letter was articulated&#xD;
with a distinct, metallic ring :-" Now, hear me! If you&#xD;
dare to come between me and my love-by the living Lord&#xD;
that sent my burning soul upon this dull earth, and who can&#xD;
hurl it hence to a burning perdition-I will find a way to&#xD;
kill you! IDe you hear me ~"&#xD;
Catherine grew pale beneath the tiger eye and clutch of&#xD;
the fearful woman, but she answered-&#xD;
"Madam, I have heard you utter wild and wicked words.,&#xD;
I will endeavor to forget them."&#xD;
"IRemember them! You are warned !"&#xD;
And releasing her hold, 'the dark lady passed from the&#xD;
room.&#xD;
Catherine remained sitting where she had left her, appalled&#xD;
by the exhibition of demoniac passion she' had witnessed,&#xD;
One pain and one fear possessed her above all others-deep&#xD;
regret that this most wicked woman had evidently already&#xD;
attained such an ascendancy ovsr the mind of Clifton, and&#xD;
dread le;~t, in despite of all the sin, she would gain her ob-&#xD;

ject-his hand! But Catherine carried all her doubts au4&#xD;
fears to her Heavenly Father. And soon to her clear, strong&#xD;
'mind it became evident, that however wicked and unscrtip~i..&#xD;
ions, potent and dangerous the Circe might be on ordinary&#xD;
occasions, ~he ~possessed too little self~.government, was undei~&#xD;
the influence of too strong and impetuous passions, to suc~&#xD;
ceed in maintaining any long course of duplicity, such 'as&#xD;
would be necessary to the accomplishment of her purpose.&#xD;
And Kate became calm. She wished to leave the house.&#xD;
She could ill boar to live under the same roof with this wo&#xD;
man, and meet her at least three times a day, at meals, if no&#xD;
4                oftener.  But she had promised Major Clifton to remain with~&#xD;
Mrs. Georgia until she should have other company, and ~she~&#xD;
j                must keep her promise. It was, besides, doubly sacred, be~&#xD;
4 ing made to him, and the pain it brought her was endurat~&#xD;
7                -borne for him.&#xD;
Mrs. Georgia sought the garden, tha open air, anywhere&#xD;
where she could breathe freely. When the storm ~in h&amp;amp;&#xD;
bosom had subsided, and reason was again in the ascendant,:&#xD;
'~          she could have torn her hair and beat her breast, yea, and&#xD;
rent liar garments with excess of chagrin, to think that she&#xD;
had so betrayed herself to Catherine. She did not 'fully he-&#xD;
lieve that Catherine would repeat this scene where it could&#xD;
injure her, or anywhere, in fact.' Still, she thought it safer&#xD;
to guard against such a contingency, and while 8he herself&#xD;
s4ill possessed the unshaken confidence and respect of Major&#xD;
Clifton, to inipu~n the conduct and character of Catherine,&#xD;
and thus forestall and invalidate any testimony she might&#xD;
hereafter g{ive. She felt that she must proceed very eau~&#xD;
tiously.. A plan of correspondence had been' arranged with&#xD;
Major Clifton, previous to his departure She soon began to&#xD;
receive long letters from him, filled with interesting descrip-&#xD;
tions of the countries through which he passed, the people&#xD;
whom he met, and philosophical comments upon both. ~ And&#xD;
to these she replied in other letters, full of appreciation, ad-&#xD;
iniration, gratitude, and breathing, besides, the highest, pu-&#xD;
rest, most disinterested sentiments and opinions upon all the&#xD;
subjects of' their correspondence. Into these letters, she&#xD;
gradually introduced the name of Catherin~-carelessly, at&#xD;
first, as if she 'thought little about her, one way or the other,&#xD;
~-as thus: "Catherine is with me still-she desires to be&#xD;
remembered ;" then, in a second letter, ~by a slight' line of&#xD;
praise, as though the girl was rather winning upon her, as-&#xD;

"Catherine i~ well. By the way, wh~t a remarkably clever&#xD;
girl she is ;" then, in another, with warmer panegyric, as&#xD;
though sl~e really very much improved upon longer acquaint-.&#xD;
ance, thus: "How, can I ev9r~ thank you sufficiently for&#xD;
placing Catherine with me ?" Next came high encomiunis upon&#xD;
Catherine's '~a~ents, iii this wise: "Catherine has left mc,&#xD;
and is with yonr mother, as no doubt the latter has written&#xD;
you. Apropos! What a~mind that girl has ~ Did you ever&#xD;
v observe ?" And then, in' a subsectuent epistle; came an ex-&#xD;
pression of wonder at the "di~lomatie" character of Kate's&#xD;
intellect, and an opinion that the writer really believed&amp;amp;er&#xD;
thrown away in private life. An~l next, a cooler mention of&#xD;
IL'&#xD;
the maiden, with the hint of~ a fear that she was gaining the&#xD;
mastery over 1~frs. Clifton's strong mind. Finally, after&#xD;
some months, she Wrote thus, as if speaking frankly from a&#xD;
senee of duty, and at the cost of great pain: "I fear that I&#xD;
have been gieatly deceived in my estimate of Catherine's&#xD;
good principles, flow shall I introduce ~what I am about to&#xD;
say to you? But you had best come home: and see for your-&#xD;

What influence this had upon Major Clifton, will be seen&#xD;

And while Georgia was exercising her power abroad, she&#xD;
was busy at home also flaying heard or guessed at Colonel&#xD;

"I do not know why I should not speak anything that&#xD;
may be upon my heart, at whatever cost t~ my natural feel-&#xD;

Yes! I will speak, for your sake. I do not fear to speak, for&#xD;
I have perfect confidence in' you. Listen then, Colonel&#xD;
Conyers, dear friend. You are not the only one who has&#xD;
missed earthly happiness. I think it must be written in the&#xD;
book of fate, that we may not have those whom we love too&#xD;
deeply-in other words, that we may not have idols. It seems&#xD;
to me, that notwithstanding all other troubles, it would make&#xD;
us too happy, in an existence designed chiefly for trial and&#xD;
probation.''&#xD;
"That is a sad, strange, despairing sentiment, for one so&#xD;
young!"&#xD;
"No, not despairing-for if we may not have joy, there&#xD;
remain the peaoe..and cheerfulness found in duty. And if&#xD;
we may not have th~ love of the heart's idol, there remain&#xD;
the affection of relatives, 'the esteem of friends, the love of&#xD;
God, and the hope of Heaven."&#xD;
"Catherine, you have loved. Tell me about it~ my&#xD;

"I intended 'to tell you about it. It is the best proof of&#xD;

fused with blushes, yet she seemed resolved to proceel. As&#xD;
if to assist her, he said-&#xD;
"This being whom you deify with your love, my child!&#xD;
what a splendid, what a magnificent nature he must have'&#xD;
what transcendent personal attractions! what an intellect!&#xD;
what a heart! Is it not so? tell me&#xD;
"Ah! no; you are mistaken; these things excite admira-&#xD;
tion and wonder, they do not of tlieniselves win affection.&#xD;
Oh, no! he of whom you speak, is not so handsome as you&#xD;
are; he has no more mind than you have, and not so much&#xD;
heart-even I admit that."&#xD;
"And yet you love him, and can love him."&#xD;
"Even so-do you wonder at it? Have not you passed&#xD;
by women-handsome, graceful, accomplished-to fix upon&#xD;
a plain country girl like me&#xD;
"Oh, but not women with your candor, purity and strength&#xD;
of mind. Oh, Kate! what depths of truth and innocence&#xD;
you have revealed in the very confession you have made me!&#xD;
Who else but yourself dared make such a revelation ?"&#xD;
Catherine looked up at the speaker in doubt.&#xD;
"Go on, dear girl. Tell me that this man adores you,&#xD;
and I will never, while I live, trouble you with myself&#xD;
againn"&#xD;
"Ah, no! it wa~ nothing like that which I set out to tell&#xD;
you. Ah, no! I only wished to let you know-that your&#xD;
case of disappointed affection is not solitary-that I too have&#xD;
missed life's crowning joy-the love of one I love. He does&#xD;
not even notice me now. I never permit myself to dream&#xD;
that he will ever love me. Yet I would like to live with him,&#xD;
to serve him-myself unknown, unnoticed, if I might only&#xD;
be near him. II envy the waiting-maids and men, and even&#xD;
the dogs, who are full-feasted every day, with the presence&#xD;
for which niy heart starves. I would like to give my life to&#xD;
his service, but I am unnecessary to his smallest need. Well1&#xD;
I cannot do him any good; but I serve one who is dear to&#xD;
him, and so I stay the hunger of my heart. Please do not&#xD;
think ill of me for telling you all this. It would grieve me&#xD;
to have you think any evil of me. I esteem you, and want&#xD;
your esteem. I have done some violence to my instincts in&#xD;
telling you this. Do not think ill of me for doing sod I&#xD;
only do it that you may know you are not the only one in&#xD;
this world who is--not happy."&#xD;
"Think ill of you, Catherine! Do anything but adore&#xD;

you-and mourn your loss forever-if lose you I must-oh,&#xD;

"This life is a tragedy-for always that which is dearest,&#xD;
is lost in it, and it ends in death. The closing scene is the&#xD;
corpse, the shroud, the coffin-and the curtain drops upon&#xD;
the grave-all beyond is hidden~eXcePt to the eye of faith.&#xD;
INly experience of life has been all darkness, clouds and storm&#xD;
-and the transient gleams of gladness or of hope have been&#xD;
-not like the sunshine, but like the lightning. Yet through&#xD;
all the grief, and gloom, and the tempting doubt, the 'still,&#xD;
small voice' of God's spirit has spoken to my soul, and com-&#xD;
forted rue."&#xD;
"Oh, Catherine, my child! that I could make your life all&#xD;
sunshine~~that you would let me try-I do believe I could&#xD;
make you ~appy.~~&#xD;
Catherine shook her head, slowly, with a sad smile, say-&#xD;
ing-&#xD;
"We all believe that! We all think that in us only is vested&#xD;
the power of making those we love happy. It is because we&#xD;
know that we are willing, anxiouS to do more for them than&#xD;
any other person would! It is a fond error. Our efforts-&#xD;
our greatest sacrifices are often needless, as we ourselves are&#xD;
nothing to our gods of flesh."&#xD;
"Am Ii )~othing~nOthing to you, then?"&#xD;
"You are my dear and honored friend."&#xD;
"Oh, Catherine, I could make your life happy! Nay,&#xD;
but do not look incredulous-I know I c6'uld. My love is&#xD;
not selfish, like that of most other men. It i~ perfectly dis-&#xD;
interested. It only asks to serve you. It only desires to see&#xD;
you at ease. Dear Kate, youhave told me all on your heart&#xD;
-you might lay that~heart, with all its burden of unrequited&#xD;
affection, upon my bosom, and I would comfort, and cherish,&#xD;
and sustain it, until I should win its love all to myself."&#xD;
Again, and more mournfully, the girl shook her head-&#xD;
"Do not pursue this subject, Colonel Conyers. Dear&#xD;
friend, by dwelling upon our wild wishes, they grow to seem&#xD;
hopes, and probabilitie5~ and certainties. In my youth-"&#xD;
"In 'your youth!' How many years ago was that, Cathe-&#xD;

by-and-by, and be all the warmer and brighter for its late-&#xD;

wisdom-at twenty-five, then she does now at eighteen-that&#xD;
lot is for her-whosesoever treasure she may be. But what&#xD;
was she going to say happened in her long passed youth ?"&#xD;
Cath~rine smiled, and said-&#xD;
"Well, then-when life was newer and fresher, believing&#xD;
~-as I do now-all the promises of the Bible-and saying--&#xD;
as I do now-that the days of miracles are not passed, and&#xD;
never will be so, until the days of God's omnipotence and&#xD;
man's faith is passed, I used to say that I would pray for&#xD;
what I wanted, though the granting of my prayer should&#xD;
seem to involve an impossibility. But noyv, later in life, I&#xD;
have learned a better lesson still, from the example of my&#xD;
Master. IJe might have saved Himself by a miracle, but He&#xD;
chose rather to endure the cross and the shame, for the work-&#xD;
ing out of His Father's will and purpose. God has a pur-&#xD;
pose and a will in every-the humblest life. And now, for&#xD;
all other vain and childish petitions, I substitute the words&#xD;
of the Saviour-' Not My will-but Thine, be done."'&#xD;
"Catherine, you must be happy, even in this world. You&#xD;
are so good. You must be made happy in the end."&#xD;
"Ah, I should be sorry to set up the plea of goodness.-.-.&#xD;
when I see so many people so much better than I am, suffer&#xD;
so deeply. It is too often represented that goodness is re-i&#xD;
warded in this world-but, oh! how can any one remember&#xD;
the life and death of a thousand martyrs, and the crucifixion&#xD;
of the Saviour, and not feel that it is not so-and not feel&#xD;
that the reverse is often so&#xD;
"Oh, Catherine, that is a very gloomy doctrine, and I will&#xD;
not believe it! There is a hopeful text of Scripture that&#xD;
comes into my mind-' Godliness is profitable in all things,&#xD;
having the promise of the life that now is, and that which is&#xD;
to come.', It is the clouds of your wintry spring that make&#xD;
everything look so gloomy to you !"&#xD;
"It is not ~ gloomy doctrine! Oh, no! npt gloomy, by&#xD;
all the hope and, illumining of the glorious Resurrection and&#xD;
Ascension."&#xD;

WINTER EVENINGS AT THE FARM.&#xD;
Oh, Winter, ruler of the inverted year,&#xD;

And dreaded as thou art.&#xD;

Fire-side enjoyments, homestead happiness,&#xD;
And all the cornfi)rts that the lowly roof&#xD;

Of long, uninterrupted evening, kaow.-COwPER.&#xD;
CATHERINE returned to Uardbargain on Christmas Eve.&#xD;
It was a clear, cold, crisp afternoon, and the level sun threw&#xD;
a glistening, yellow lustre, like powdered gold dust, over the&#xD;
crusted surface of the snow-clad earth And as Kate's little,&#xD;
rough-coated pony stepped freely out over the ground, life&#xD;
and hope and joy tided back to her heart, giving bloom to&#xD;
her cheeks, light to her eyes,, and elasticity to all her mo-&#xD;
tions. She was very glad indeed to find herself on her way&#xD;
to the farm, and about to exchange Athe feverish, exciting&#xD;
atmosphere of White Cliffs, and the disturbing proximity of&#xD;
Georgia, for the long, calm days, and long, calm evenings&#xD;
with Mrs. Clifton, at the farm-house. She reached her des-&#xD;
tination at dusk. Mrs. Clifton met the girl with a smile of&#xD;
pleasure, and welcomed her with a kiss of affection. Then&#xD;
she conducted her into the parlor, where she made her sit&#xD;
down by the fire, while she removed her bonnet and shawl.&#xD;
Next she summoned Ilenny, and gave orders that tea should&#xD;
be served immediately, and a fire kindled in' Miss Catherine's&#xD;
room, as the young lady was fatigued, and would wish to&#xD;
rotirO early. There was in the manner of the lady upon&#xD;
this evening, and from this evening, a maternal tenderness&#xD;
and solicitude, very soothii~g and delightful to Catherine.&#xD;
This was so apparent to th~e domestics, that they began to&#xD;
deport themselves towards the maiden with the, deference&#xD;
due to the daughter of the house.&#xD;
And how calmly and cheerfully the winter days passed.&#xD;

&#xD;
There was the early rising, and the early breakfast, in the&#xD;
warm, bright, back parlor, where the morning sun shone in.&#xD;
There was the leisurely talk over the meal, about the occu~&#xD;
nations, which were also the amusements of the day. Afte1'&#xD;
breakfast, came the ride around the farm, in the course of&#xD;
which every field and barn and granary was inspected, and&#xD;
every negro quarter visited. And during these rides, Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton gave (Ik~therine much information relating to agricul-&#xD;
tural matters.&#xD;
"For, my dear," she said, "some day you may be a&#xD;
planter's wife, and have all these things to look after, while&#xD;
your husband is in the public service, absent with his regi-&#xD;
ment, or at the legislature." To Which Catherine ventured&#xD;
no reply. And then came dinner, and the short afternoon&#xD;
nap, and tea, and the long, serene evening, by the fireside,&#xD;
employed in needle-work, enhivei~cd by rational, cheerful&#xD;
conversation, and occasionally varied by music or reading,&#xD;
and finally ended by family prayer and bed.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton and Catherine never, never wearied of&#xD;
each other. They had many occupations for hands and&#xD;
heads-they Were both strong, original thinkers, and above&#xD;
all, were both deeply interested in the same being-the&#xD;
absentee.&#xD;
And now Catherine enjoyed a very dear, but dangerous&#xD;
delight, in the perusal of Major Clifton's letters of travel.&#xD;
These letters arrived about two in a month. And, ah! the&#xD;
evenings, when'they came, were festivals indeed to the re-&#xD;
cluse~lady and the maiden. Often when one was brought in,&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton reclining, through weakness, upon .the sofa,&#xD;
shading her eyes with her hand, would say, "Break the seal&#xD;
and read it to me, dear Catherine." 'And Kate would do&#xD;
so-drawing delicious draughts of perilous pleasure from the&#xD;
poetic and artistic spirit that pervaded every sentiment, nar-&#xD;
rative and description in the epistle. And on these long,&#xD;
quiet 'winter evenings, very often the conversation turned&#xD;
upon the absent son-the dear topic always introduced by&#xD;
his mother. It seemed as if Mrs. Clifton ~wished to make&#xD;
Catherine thoroughly acquainted with 'his character and dis-&#xD;
position-with his faults and w~knesses, as well as with his&#xD;
virtues and powers.&#xD;
"My son has his serious imperfections, like other men, of&#xD;
course-though your eyes contradict me, Catherine; if I,&#xD;
his partial mother, see them, they exist, you may depend.&#xD;
&#xD;
Archer is no demigod, my dear, in the estimation of any&#xD;
one, but-well, no matter-don't blush so-I am his mother,&#xD;
and I love him, too, and think highly of him, of course, but&#xD;
I acknowledge he is no angel, Kate, and I should be sorry&#xD;
you, should take him for one-disapp~Antment would come&#xD;
of it, my dear. He is proud, jealous, and suspicious as a&#xD;
Spaniard, and while under the influence of these feelings, he&#xD;
is reserved and sullen as an Indian-yet these faults of cha-&#xD;
racter have been so transfigured in my dear Kate's affection,&#xD;
that they have actually seemed virtues-the pride, jealousy&#xD;
and suspicion have seemed high sense of honor and intellectual&#xD;
acumen-and the reserve and sullenness-dignity! Is it not&#xD;
so, my dear ~"&#xD;
Kate's eyes lighted, and her cheeks flushed highly, but&#xD;
not with bashfulness-with an emotion that was swelling at&#xD;
her heart-and carried away from ~elf.consciousness by *en-&#xD;
thusiasm, she~answered-&#xD;
"Oh, madam! I know what I would say to you, if I only&#xD;
knew how to say it. Heaven sends divine thoughts and&#xD;
feelings into my heart and brain~'sometimes, but they cannot&#xD;
pass thence into words-a-they are choked up perhaps by sin&#xD;
or imperfection. Such a feeling I have now-heavenly light,&#xD;
if I could only refract it-" She paused an i~istant, uncon~&#xD;
scious that the lady was looking intently upon her. Then&#xD;
she spoke again, slowly, in a kind of calm fervor-" Real&#xD;
affection-I do not mean passion or imagination-but real&#xD;
love does never invest its object with unreal virtues&#xD;
never !-all faults are the excess or the deficiency of some&#xD;
virtue-well, real love sees its object not perhaps as he is at&#xD;
his worst-not even perhaps so evil as he is even at his best,&#xD;
but as he may become !-as he surely will become, if that&#xD;
real affection continues faithful to its trust. Ah! how&#xD;
strong that conviction is in my heart-how weak upon my&#xD;
lips !"&#xD;
"I understand you, Catherine, and may your true affection&#xD;
be the divine alchemy that shall transmute all Archer Clif-&#xD;
ton's faults into virtues." At this personal reply, Catherine~s.&#xD;
eyes fell and her oh~eks burned with sudden.self-recollection,&#xD;
and for weeks after this she~~jpuld not recall the conversation&#xD;
without deep blushes.&#xD;
More and more freely as the weeks passed by did Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton talk to Kate of her son and his peculiarities, and the&#xD;
best way to meet them.&#xD;

THE CUUSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE OURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
"You know, my dear Catherine, the apostle, in 'order to&#xD;
win 'proselytes, made himself all things to all men. Archer&#xD;
is proud, .and my dear girl must raise herself a little out of&#xD;
that hinnility of manner which is very distasteful to the&#xD;
haughty, except when exhibited towards themselves, when&#xD;
it naturally becomes very acceptable." This ~tyle of con~&#xD;
versation, addressed to her for weeks and months, was at&#xD;
once ~rery pleasing and very painful to Kate. It was sweet,&#xD;
it was dear beyond measure, to* be considered in this near&#xD;
relation to her beloved, to be addressed! daily and hourly as&#xD;
if she possessed the power of rendering his future life better&#xD;
and happier, and so addressed by his own mother, too, but it&#xD;
was also humiliating to be supposed to presume on the future&#xD;
esteem and affection of one who had never addressed the lan..&#xD;
guage of. love to her. Often she thought of begging Mrs.&#xD;
Clifton to desist from this style of conversation; but a cer-&#xD;
tain bashfulness, a deep respect for the lady, a distrust of&#xD;
herself and of her own experience, and the childish thought&#xD;
that Major Clifton might have entrusted to his mother an in-&#xD;
tention that he never confided to herself its object, and the&#xD;
delight of living in this blessed illusion,' and the fear of&#xD;
breaking the charm, kept her silent for a long time, during&#xD;
which Mrs. Clifton gradually fell into the manner of con-&#xD;
&amp;amp;dering her and speaking to her as her son's future wife~&#xD;
All at once one day it suddenly struck Kate that Mrs. Clif..&#xD;
ton might be the victim of a mistake, and under the impres-&#xD;
sion that some understanding or engagement existed between&#xD;
herself and Major Clifton, and that her own silence and&#xD;
seeming acquiescence had served to confirm this error. And&#xD;
this very natural and rational thought fell upon the girl like&#xD;
a thunderbolt, utterly blasting and destroying all her beau-&#xD;
tiful hopes, and covering her face with the blushes of deep&#xD;
humiliation. She felt that she must undeceive Mrs. Clifton&#xD;
immediately. So when they sat together at the work-table,&#xD;
before the eVexiing fire, and the lady spoke of her son, say-&#xD;
ing, among other things-&#xD;
"The most, unhappy trait in his characters his tendency&#xD;
to suspicion, my loves Be straightforward with him, Cathe-&#xD;
rine, never have a secret from ~m, not even one touching a&#xD;
little pleasant surprise, be perfectLy frank and open-hearted&#xD;
with him, and, alas ! even that course may not always save,&#xD;
you from, suffering by his besetting sin, and when it does not,&#xD;
Catherine, there is nothing left for you but patience and&#xD;
&#xD;
trust. You see, on Archer's behalf, I expect a great deal&#xD;
of you, my love, like all mothers-in-law, I suppose."&#xD;
Catherine's face was bent over her work; ashamed of her&#xD;
supposed mistake, ashamed of the weakness that now choked&#xD;
her voice, she remained silent for some time. At length,&#xD;
gathering a false impression from her long continued silence,&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton said~-&#xD;
"Do I hope too much from you, Kate, my love P'&#xD;
With an effort, Catherine controlled her emotion, looked&#xD;
up and replied, steadily-&#xD;
"No, no, dear Mrs. Clifton, you do not demand too much&#xD;
of me. As far as my will and my power, as far as the grace&#xD;
of God aids me, I will serve Major Clifton with the affection&#xD;
~nd fidelity of a sister and a servant, but I have not the&#xD;
smallest reason to suppose that he will ever admit me to a&#xD;
friendship sufficiently intimate to make it possible for mc to&#xD;
affect his character and conduct in any way, even if I should&#xD;
presume to wish it."&#xD;
"My dear Kate, Archer's wife will be his friend, com-&#xD;
panion and counsellor-he never would be happy with a mere&#xD;
housekeeper or parlor ornament, however beautifully accom-&#xD;
plished and amiable-it is therefore he will prize my dear&#xD;
Catherine's clear, strong mind and proud heart-she will be&#xD;
admitted to his closest thoughts and his noblest counsels, do&#xD;
not doubt it."&#xD;
"Oh, madam, you do not comprehend'me yet, I see. How&#xD;
deeply rooted your mistake Anust be, dear lady! Oh, how&#xD;
shall I tell you ~ Indeed you are in error if you suppose--&#xD;
if you suppose that-"~ Kate stopped short and burst into&#xD;
tears.&#xD;
Mrs. ~lifton encircled her waist with her arm, and&#xD;
"Come, Rate, stop all this blushing and weeping. Let&#xD;
us be confidential, you and I, as mother and daughter should&#xD;
be, for 'you are as my own daughter, Kate, and am I not ~&#xD;
mother. to you P'&#xD;
"Oh, yes! yes! dear lady !" said Catherine, taking her&#xD;
hand, and pressing it to her bosom, and covering it with&#xD;
kisses. "Oh, yes, you are indeed like a mother to me, if I&#xD;
were only worthy to be your daughter! and I love and honor&#xD;
you more than ever a mother was loved and honored in this&#xD;
world before, I do believe !"&#xD;
"Then let there be no reserve between us, dear Kate.&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
Let us be open with each other, as parent and child, whose&#xD;
loves, and hopes, and wishes are the same. I have been&#xD;
plain with you all along, only, gradually unfolding your&#xD;
future, not to alarm your shyness-and to win your confi-&#xD;
dence. I have longed for this confidence-this perfect open..&#xD;
ness between us-that we might talk with more intelligence,&#xD;
and with more comfort-and I have courted it -by my own&#xD;
frankness; but in return for all my candor, Catherine has&#xD;
shown me only reserve and blushes. Will she be more con-&#xD;
fiding now V'&#xD;
"Alas, dearest lady, what can I say to you, but that ~you&#xD;
are greatly mistaken-sadly mistaken-oh, yes, indeed, sadly&#xD;
replied Kate, almost&#xD;
mistaken,"                  weeping again.&#xD;
"I am not mistaken in- supposing that Catherine loves my&#xD;
son. I am not mistaken in knowing that the fact gives me&#xD;
more happiness than anything else in the world. Yet Iwould&#xD;
like to hear Kate admit it."&#xD;
"Well, dearest lady-yes !-down, pride !-if it will give&#xD;
you any pleasure to 'hear it, I must not withhold the confes-&#xD;
sion-yes, I dc~ love your son-so much-so much-that it&#xD;
will make me an old maid !"&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton laughed, a little, low, jolly laugh. (The lady&#xD;
very seldom laughed, and when she did, it had a strange, ex-&#xD;
ceedingly pleasant effect upon the hearer-it was a very&#xD;
agreeable surprise, revealing, as it were under that grave,&#xD;
stern surface, traces of a mine of wit, humor, fun and mis-&#xD;
chief, that must have existed, and frequently sparkled forth,&#xD;
ere the sorrow and the seriousness of life smothered and ex-&#xD;
tinguished it.) She laughed her little, low, jolly laugh, and&#xD;
replied-&#xD;
"That were a strange effect of love, Catherine; but trust&#xD;
me, it will not be so with Archer's consent."&#xD;
"Dear Mrs. Clifton, forgive me for saying again, that y'u&#xD;
are very much mistaken-never, never in his life, has Major&#xD;
Clifton bestowed upon me one word, or look, that might be&#xD;
misconstrued by the vainest woman into a preference !"&#xD;
"Well, Kate! I know that! I know that he has never&#xD;
addressed you on the subject. But 1 know that he will do&#xD;
so. For he loves you, Catherine, and has loved you from the&#xD;
first hour he ever saw you-even from the-the night he sat&#xD;
and studied you in your brother's cabin. And it is just as&#xD;
certain that you will be his wife, as that you both will live to&#xD;
marry. So, dearest, let there be no more reserve between&#xD;
&#xD;
us-consider this marriage sure, as it really is-.(sO far as any&#xD;
future event is sure)-and let me talk freely, for my time and&#xD;
opportunity is short."&#xD;
Catherine raised her eyes to the sallow-almost cadaverous&#xD;
face of the lady, and a conviction of the truth and reality&#xD;
of what she predicted, forced itself upon her, with a sharp&#xD;
pang.&#xD;
"Now, dear Catherine, I did not ask you for that troubled&#xD;
look! Will your heart ache because a dry leaf drops. in the&#xD;
autumn, rather than hangs shivering on the tree through half&#xD;
the winter ~ But, dear child, I allude to this coming event,&#xD;
not to cast its £ shadow' over you, but to explain why I wish&#xD;
now to use these days in making you as conversant with the&#xD;
idiosyncrasies of your future companion, a~ enly years of&#xD;
married life could do, and to prevent years, perhaps, of mis-&#xD;
understanding and sorrow. There is something dreadful in&#xD;
the discovery of unsuspected faults, after marriage-and&#xD;
something very, very mournful in the disappointment of the&#xD;
trusting affection, and in the saddened efforts of the heart&#xD;
to adjust itself to 'the circumstances-efforts that in one case&#xD;
out of ten, perhaps, succeed. But if the worst is known be-&#xD;
fore marriage, the man or the woman may consider well&#xD;
whether they have the strength of heart to conquer their own&#xD;
faults, and bear with those of their companion. That you&#xD;
would do all this for your husband, Kate, I am convinced.&#xD;
I only talk now to smooth your path of duty." The lady&#xD;
here released Catherine from the embrace in which she had&#xD;
held her through this conversation, and desired her to ring&#xD;
for the servants to come in to prayers.&#xD;
Catherine, as had been her custom for several weeks past-&#xD;
upon account of Mrs. Clifton's weakness-conducted the&#xD;
evening devotions.&#xD;
When prayers were over, and the servants dismissed,&#xD;
Catherine attended Mrs. Clifton to her chamber, and assisted&#xD;
her with affectionate care until sh~ had retired. to bed. Then,&#xD;
after receiving the lady's parting kiss, she hastened into her&#xD;
own chamber, threw herself upon the bed, and gave way to&#xD;
a long-pent burst of sorrow. Within the last three years&#xD;
Catherine had seen much sickness, death, and bereavement&#xD;
~one after another of her associates or relations had faded&#xD;
and fallen, and she had mourned their loss; and her life had&#xD;
taken a sombre hue, and sunken into a depressed tone. But&#xD;

&#xD;
dear companion-this more than mother, sister, all to her&#xD;
heart-should pass away from the eaxth and be seen no more!&#xD;
Oh! it brought a sense of desolation that threw a shadow and&#xD;
a chill over all ~t1ie future-over even the bright hopes shining&#xD;
in the distance. And then the identity of the love she bore&#xD;
mother and son together forced itself upon her heart. And&#xD;
she felt that a union with the son could not give her perfect&#xD;
content, unless the mother were there to share her love and&#xD;
service, and to participate in their happiness. Without that&#xD;
mother's presence, their plan.of life would be unfinished.&#xD;
their circle of love incomplete. And oh! came the sharp,&#xD;
agonizing question, how could she ever bear to lose the light,&#xD;
and warmth, and strength, imparted daily, hourly, from that&#xD;
dear face-that face which had never looked on her but in&#xD;
affection-that face, the very image of Clifton's own, except&#xD;
that it was sweeter, holier, and never, never harsh-how&#xD;
could she ever bear to lose her sweet resting place on that&#xD;
more than maternal bosom-that bosom on which she could&#xD;
ever lay her aching head, or aching heart, in perfect peace&#xD;
and confidence, sure of being understood, sure of being sym~&#xD;
pathized with ~ Oh! life Would be darkened indeed when&#xD;
she should pass away. The sense of sorrow was so sharp, so&#xD;
agonizing, that the girl could have thrown herself upon the&#xD;
floor-could have wrestled with Heaven, in wild prayer, that&#xD;
this life might be saved, and this sharp anguish spared her.&#xD;
B~~t Catherine was habitually self-restrained, and she bore&#xD;
this mental anguish as she would have endured severe physi..&#xD;
cal pain-in silence, in patience, until her soul was subdued&#xD;
to the meekness of resignation. And then prayer brought&#xD;
comfort.&#xD;
And she met the lady in the morning with a cheei~ful coun-&#xD;
tenance. And they spent the day as usual.&#xD;
So passed the winter and the spring. Though Mrs. Clif-&#xD;
ton failed visibly from day to day, she still continued her&#xD;
-rides around the farm, and her general supervision of the&#xD;
household and of agricultural' affairs, and her instructions to&#xD;
Catherine. Her people, who well knew the nearly hopeless&#xD;
state of her health, foretold that their mistress would keep&#xD;
up and out to the very last-and finally die in her chair.&#xD;
Indeed, while flesh and blood wasted away, her nervous en-&#xD;
ergy seemed unimpaired, and her cheerfulness was undimin-&#xD;
ished. She taked of hpr approaching departure as* calmly&#xD;
and pleasantly as she would have talked of going to Rioh.&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
mond. Never obtruding the subject, however, unless neces-&#xD;
sity demanded its introduction.&#xD;
The serenity and cheerfulness ~f the lady affected C&amp;amp;the-&#xD;
erine very beneficially-" familiarizing~~ to hey feelings the&#xD;
future, immortal life. Catherine endeavored to persuade her&#xD;
to have a physician.&#xD;
"Why, so I would, Kate, if I had any specific disease; but&#xD;
when all the frame is wearing out together very slowly and&#xD;
quietly, why call in a doctor to disturb the harmony of natu-&#xD;
ral decay, and painfully build up one portion of the sinking&#xD;
frame at the expense of another ~ ' Why not fade and fall&#xD;
easily, as all else in benign nature does l"&#xD;
Catherine next suggested writing for Major Clifton to&#xD;
hasten home.&#xD;
"Why, my child ~ Wify, because I am going the common&#xD;
road, should others be hurried and worried ~ everything in&#xD;
blessed nature and Divine Revelation teaches us a sweeter&#xD;
lesson. No~Archer set' out for a twelve months' tour; let&#xD;
him complete it. He will return this autumn. Quite time&#xD;
enough, Catherine. I shall live till then, and longer. I can&#xD;
calculate the progress of my body's failing, and the duration&#xD;
of my life, with almost' mathematical precision. I shall live&#xD;
to meet Archer, and to see you married, Catherine-and to&#xD;
leave you willing to survive me and be happy without me.&#xD;
And why not, dear ~ for shall I not be happier still '?"&#xD;
And so, in sweet mutual confidence, in cheerfxil resigna-&#xD;
tion, and in patient hope, the summer passed, and autumn&#xD;
arrived in its glory.&#xD;

THE RETURN.&#xD;
Come home !-.4here is a sorrowmg breath&#xD;
In music since ye went,&#xD;
And fragrant flower scents wander by&#xD;
With mournful memories blent.&#xD;
Tbe tones of every household voice&#xD;
Are grown more sad and deep-&#xD;
And longing for thee wakes a wish&#xD;
To turn aside and weep.&#xD;
Oh, ye beloved! come home !-the hour&#xD;
Of runny a greeting tone,&#xD;
The time of hearth-light and of song&#xD;
Returns and ye are gone!&#xD;
And darkly, heavily it 1~lls&#xD;
On the forsaken room,&#xD;
Burdening the heart widi tenderness&#xD;
That deepens into gIoom.-.-M~s; IIE1~f4N5.&#xD;
NOTWITHSTANDING all her habitual calmness and cheerful&#xD;
patience, Mrs. Clifton began to grow uneasy at her son's pro-&#xD;
tracted stay. He bad been absent a year and a 'niouth. And&#xD;
even now, instead of setting out on his return, he~4~ wrote&#xD;
of comizig home soon, At one time he was at ~ina, at~&#xD;
another at Berlin, then at the Hague, progression deed,&#xD;
but very, very slowly towards England and Livcrp from&#xD;
which port he intended to embark. Every letter tl~at 'came&#xD;
from him at this period, was opened and read with visible Un-&#xD;
easiness by his mother. At length the glad tidings came, a&#xD;
letter from the mid-ocean, brought by a swift sailing packet..~'&#xD;
boat that had spoken the vessel in which he had embarked&#xD;
lie was hasteninA home, and might now be expected at an~~&#xD;
hours The news con~Lained in his letter excited the invalid so&#xD;
much uponAhe evening of its reception, that she passed a&#xD;
sleepless night, and rose the next morning weaker than she&#xD;
had ever been before; so weak, indeed, that she Was obliged,'&#xD;
in coming down stairs, to lean on the arms of Catherine and&#xD;
her maid for support. And when she reached the parlor,&#xD;
&#xD;
she was compelled to recline in an easy-chair, propped up by&#xD;
pillows, and with her feet supported by a foQt-cushiOfl. But&#xD;
her cheerfulness was undimjnished. She gave many direc-&#xD;
tions as to the adjustment and adornment of the room, and&#xD;
the preparation of certain dainties. Lastly she called Cathe-&#xD;
rine to her side, and took her hand. Catherine did not ap-&#xD;
pear to the best advantage, with her plain, dark gingham&#xD;
dress, and her chestnut hair divided simply abova her fore-&#xD;
head, rippling in tiny wavelets around her broad temples, and&#xD;
gathered into a twist behind. This plainness of style did not&#xD;
become her strongly marked features. And the lady saw it,&#xD;
for she gazed thoughtfully upon the girl awhile, and then&#xD;
lifting her hand, disengaged aportiofl of her tresses from the&#xD;
comb, and let them fall, turning into natural ringlet~ down&#xD;
her cheeks, saying-&#xD;
"~There, Catherine, when hair curls naturally and volun-&#xD;
tarily, it is certain that the face it belongs to requires it so,&#xD;
and that it should be permitted to follow its nature, for na-&#xD;
ture does all things well. Why don't you always wear your&#xD;
hair, so ~ It is so much prettier.~~&#xD;
"Because, dear lady, I never thought it of any importance&#xD;
how my hair was fixed, so that it looked neat. But I will&#xD;
wear it this way, if it pleases you."&#xD;
"It does. Your face is not a classic one, dear Kate, and&#xD;
none but a classic face can bear that attic syinplicity of style.&#xD;
Your countenance is a very noble one, Kate, but its very&#xD;
nobility is hard and stern, without the softening shadow of&#xD;
these ringThts nature has bestowed upon ~ Ther&amp;amp; now,&#xD;
look in ~he mirror, my little Oliver Cromwell, your ~face is&#xD;
much womanly than before.~~&#xD;
Oath me found it so. The ~oft, bright, drooping curls&#xD;
shaded and rounded her large, square forehead into beautiful&#xD;
proportion' to her other features, and softened the expresSiOn&#xD;
of the whole. No girl but is pleased to see herself' improved&#xD;
in beauty,' and it was with a bright blush, half of pleasure,&#xD;
half of modesty, that the maiden returned to the lady's side.'&#xD;
"Now, dear Kate, you must leave off that dingy gingham,&#xD;
and wear white wrappers in the morning. It is early in the&#xD;
season, and you can wear white a month longer yet, and by&#xD;
the end of 'that time, I suppose, the world will expect you to&#xD;
~wear black.' You have no white wrappers thougl~1fly dear V'&#xD;

ment, they will do for morning dresses. Do me the kindness&#xD;
to wear them. Nay, now, Catherine, my dear, no hesitation,&#xD;
I will bave it so. Go at once and put on one of them."&#xD;
I(ate complied, and in a short time returned to the parlor&#xD;
-by this change in the sty~e of her toilet, almost trans~.&#xD;
figured, yet without the loss of her noble characteristics.&#xD;
One thought troubled the maiden, the question ~-What&#xD;
would Clifton think of this?' How would he take it? Would&#xD;
he suspect that ~lie had dressed for his eyes? If he did his&#xD;
suspicions would be well-founded. And the consciousness of&#xD;
this truth, suffused with blushes the cheeks of the ingenuous&#xD;
girl, and heightened all her beauty.&#xD;
There was no certainty of Major Clifton's advent that day&#xD;
-he might come any day, but nevertheless they hoped for&#xD;
and expected his arrival. By a change in the hours, the&#xD;
stage now reached L- at noon. And Mrs. Clifton' had&#xD;
ordered dinner in the full expectation of having her son's&#xD;
company at that meal. Nor were their hopes destined to&#xD;
disappointment. A little after one o'clock, the carriage that&#xD;
had been sent to L to meet the stage, returned and&#xD;
drove up to the door. And Archer Clifton alighted from it,&#xD;
and hastened joyfully into the house. Mrs. Clifton arose to&#xD;
meet him, but, overpowered by agitation and weakness, she&#xD;
sank l5ack into her seat. Her son was before her in an&#xD;
instant, and had clasped her in his arms, and pressed her to&#xD;
his breast, and kissed her fondly many times, and sat her&#xD;
back in her chair to feast his eyes upon her beloved face and&#xD;
form, before he noticed how cadaverous, how death-like, she&#xD;
looked;, ~then a startled expression of surp4se and alarm&#xD;
sprung into his countenance, and he turned upon. Kate, to&#xD;
whom he had not yet spoken, a glance of mingled 'inquiry,&#xD;
anger and reproach.&#xD;
"You find me in poor health, Archer; but not worse m&#xD;
son, than what might have been expected." ~ y&#xD;
"My dearest mother," he began, but his voice choked, and&#xD;
to conceal the emotion he could not entirely suppress, he&#xD;
turned to Catherine and gave her a brother's greeting in si-&#xD;
lence~ hut at the same time darting into her eyes a look of&#xD;
stern rebuke from his" own, which seemed to say, "You, at&#xD;
least~ ~hould have written and informed me of this." And&#xD;
the -susp~aions e~eited by Mrs. Georgia rose darkly in his&#xD;
mind, but wore repressed again instantly.&#xD;
"Dearest Archer, I am not usually so ill as I seem to-&#xD;
&#xD;
day. I have never been confined to my bed, or even my&#xD;
chair yet. Only to-day and yesterday, the joy of looking for&#xD;
you has prevented my taking the usual quantity of sleep. I&#xD;
shall be much better to-morrow. Sit down by me and rest,&#xD;
and when you are rested, your room is quite ready for you,&#xD;
if you wish to change your dress before dinner. Catherine,&#xD;
my love, will you go and direct them to serve dinner ?"&#xD;
Catherine left the room and gave the necessary commands.&#xD;
Then she ordered a boy to take Major Clift6n's baggage up&#xD;
into his chamber, and went up stairs to show h~m where to&#xD;
put it. 'In the meantime, Major Clifton, in looking upon his&#xD;
mother's wasted form, had lost all self-command, and saying&#xD;
hastily that he thought he would 'change his traveling dress&#xD;
at once, hurried out of the room to give vent to a passionate&#xD;
sorrow, no longer to be restrained. He ran up stairs, but&#xD;
paused upon the first landing. Catherine, in leaving his room,&#xD;
found him leaning upon the balustrades,' with his face buried&#xD;
in his hands, weeping convulsively. To women, there- is&#xD;
something really appalling in a man's tears-we look upon&#xD;
them with more than pity-with awe-with something like&#xD;
the feeling with which Mary and Martha must have witnessed&#xD;
the Saviour's tears-with deep revercyice be it said. Cathe-'&#xD;
rine would have crept by and slipped down stairs quietly~ for&#xD;
she had a feeling of self-reproach for having even seen that&#xD;
strong outburst of sorrow; but he stood up and seized her&#xD;
hand, and drew her towards him, exclaiming-&#xD;
"Stop,. Catherine! You have seen my weakness! Now,&#xD;
tell me why you did not write to me of this? Cruel and selfish&#xD;
girl! were you so intent upon your own projects, that you&#xD;
could not find time 't6 indite a line to let me know that my&#xD;
mother was' dying ?"&#xD;
Another burst of weeping prevented his hearing Catherine~s&#xD;
gentle ex lanation, that Mrs. Clifton would not permit her&#xD;
to write. And Kate was not anxious to exculpate herself&#xD;
from an unjust charge; indeed, after once giving her little,&#xD;
meek explanation, she never thought of it again-she only&#xD;
thought of his agony of regret, and only wished to soothe it.&#xD;
He still held her wrist, unconsciously straining it in the&#xD;
strength of his emotion, until' it pained' her.. severely. But&#xD;
she did not care for that, she did not even feel it; she 'only&#xD;
cared to see him weep so convulsively, and losing tdl '~lf-&#xD;
consciousness, and with it all reserve, she threw' her arm&#xD;

around him, and dropping her head against him most tenderly,&#xD;
most lovingly, she said-&#xD;
"Oh, do not grieve so! do not! see how calm and cheer-&#xD;
ful she is! Try to emulate her calmness !"&#xD;
"I loved her, Kate! I loved her more than ever son loved&#xD;
mother before! She was the worth of life to me! I loved&#xD;
her more than ever I loved human being! More even than&#xD;
I ever loved you, Kate !"&#xD;
This was Clifton's first declaration to Catherine, and a&#xD;
strange time, place and circumstances, and a strange method&#xD;
of expressing his preference had fallen upon them. "I loved&#xD;
her more than I ever loved you, Kate !"&#xD;
But it did not seem strange to Catherine. lit seemed per-&#xD;
fectly natural and in order. It did not startle her the least.&#xD;
It did not bring back her womanly self-consciousness, for she&#xD;
answered, meekly.-.&#xD;
"I know it-I know you do. And, oh! don't you l~now&#xD;
that I would willingly give my life for hers, if I could restore&#xD;
her, in health, to your affections '?"&#xD;
"And yet you did not even write to let me know she was&#xD;
ill! 'Oh! girl! girl! you were much to blame for that! It&#xD;
was bitterly wrong."&#xD;
".1 told you, but you did not hear me, that she would not&#xD;
permit mc to write; she did not wish to give you pain, or to&#xD;
interfere with your arrangements for the year."&#xD;
"Catherine, that does not excuse you! Could not your&#xD;
own heart have told you how precious, how inestimable to me&#xD;
would have been every hour of her company when her days&#xD;
were x~iimbered ~ Could you not have iw4tten to me se-&#xD;
cretly '?"&#xD;
"I never did anything secretly in my life. I should never&#xD;
have thought of doing so. Il3esides, I could not have had a&#xD;
secret from her, so open, so frank, so noble as she is. No, I&#xD;
proposed to write for you to come home, I entreated permis..&#xD;
'sion to do so, but she refused to grant it, and I def~red to&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIFTON~&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
hastened down stairs, and the thought of her transient self-&#xD;
forgetfulness rendered the girl even shyer than ever.&#xD;
He went into his room and refreshed himself with a new&#xD;
toilet. And when he entered the parlor, an hour after, no&#xD;
one would have suspected from his handsome, animated face,&#xD;
the existence of the sorrow that lay subdued at the bottom of&#xD;
his heart.&#xD;
They dined together, and after dinner Catherine thought&#xD;
it best to retire and leave the mother aixd son alone to enjoy&#xD;
more fully their re-union. When she had left the room-&#xD;
"How pretty and lady-like Catherine is growing, madam,"&#xD;
said Major Clifton, looking after her, but addressing his&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
"Yes," replied Mrs. Clifton, "lady-like, but not very&#xD;
pretty; Kate will never be pretty;' but if she be 'blessed to&#xD;
her mind,' she will be more, she will be handsome."&#xD;
After spending a long afternoon with his mother, Major&#xD;
Clifton took temporary leave, and went over to White Cliffs,&#xD;
to pay his respects to Mrs. Georgia. Most happily for all&#xD;
concerned, Georgia had just loft home for a visit of some&#xD;
weeks at ~ichmoud~ignorant, it ~s to be supposed, of Major&#xD;
Clifton's arrival. He returned and spent the evening with&#xD;
the ladies at Hardbargain.&#xD;
The next morning found Mrs. Clifton very much better-and&#xD;
in the evening she rode out, accompanied by Major Clifton&#xD;
and Catherine. Mrs. Clifton's cheerfulness infected all the&#xD;
party-both upon this evening and afterwards. Her decline&#xD;
was so gradual, so painless, that she never took to her bed--&#xD;
but when weakest, sat in the easy-chair in the parlor, often&#xD;
with a little light knitting in her hands, that she would&#xD;
leisurely work upon, or drop into her lap, to be resumed at&#xD;
pleasure, while sh~ conversed with Catherine and Major&#xD;
Clifton, or listened while one of them read, or both sang.&#xD;
There never were more pleasant~ serene days, than these of&#xD;
the invalid's gentle decay. It was genial, pensive autumn;&#xD;
the fall of the leaf without the house, and the fall of the leaf&#xD;
within.&#xD;
Catherine was now the housekeeper. She had-through&#xD;
the increasing weakness of the lady-so gradually slidden&#xD;
into this office, that she scarcely knew at what time its whole&#xD;
burden had accumulated upon her. One morning, while&#xD;
Catherine was in the store-room giving out meal and bacon&#xD;
to the negroes, Mrs. Clifton and Major Clifton occupied th~&#xD;

parlor alone. He had been reading to her from Jeremy&#xD;
Taylor, but seeing that she had dropped her knitting, and&#xD;
was sitting back with a look of weariness, he thought it time&#xD;
to desist and close the book.&#xD;
"Dear mother, you are fatigued; will you have anything?&#xD;
What shall I bring you ?"&#xD;
"Nothing, my son. I am not wearied more than usual,&#xD;
and it will pass in a 'few minutes."&#xD;
The lady was silent for a little while, during which Major&#xD;
Clifton refrained from conversation. And then, after some&#xD;
little thought, she raised her eyes until they met his own~&#xD;
and looking at him full in the face, she asked-~&#xD;
"When are yon going to marry Catherine, Archer ~&#xD;
Major Clifton started violently, and looked at the lady in&#xD;
silent astonishment.&#xD;
"Nay, pray answer me-my question is an earnest one."&#xD;
"~y dear madam, you have taken mc by surprise !"&#xD;
"Necessary bluntness, Archer~"&#xD;
"Very Oliver Cromwellish, madam, my mother."&#xD;
"You must excuse it, dear Archer. You did not op en&#xD;
the subject to me, therefore, feeling more anxious upon that&#xD;
affair than any other on earth, I am forced to broach it to&#xD;
you. But you have not answered my question yet."&#xD;
"Dear madam-what~exactly..-was it ?"&#xD;
"When are you going to marry Catherine ?"&#xD;
"Upon my honor, my dear madam, I haire no intention&#xD;
of marrying Catherine; nor have I ever given her reason to&#xD;
suppose so."&#xD;
"Ah! I had thought, or rather, I ha~ hoped otherwise,"&#xD;
said the lady, relapsing into silence, while Major Clifton&#xD;
subsided into painful thought. Again the dark suspicions&#xD;
insinuated by Mrs. Georgia, arose in his mind, to be repressed&#xD;
again with loathing; and he said indignantly to himself.-." It&#xD;
is pot true! I can never believe her to be an intriguante.&#xD;
Georgia is mistaken~Georgia's grateful and affectionate in-&#xD;
terest in my welfare, leads her to unjust suspicions of others.&#xD;
Kate is noble-hearted-Kate is true-is truth itself. It&#xD;
would be misery to believe otherwise.&#xD;
Mrs. Clifton gently interrupted his silent self-communion,&#xD;
hy saying..-&#xD;
"'Well, Archer, since you have no intention whatever of&#xD;
marrying Catherine yourself, you can have no reasonable&#xD;
ground of objection to her union with another ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
lie looked up in surprise and anxiety, but soon the&#xD;
startled expression subsided into calmness, and he replied,&#xD;
coolly-&#xD;
~~Catherine'S~UfliOn with another!, Oh! the supposition&#xD;
involves an impossibility."&#xD;
"I know you think so, Archer. I know you feel per-&#xD;
fectly secure of this sweet girl, and just as easy about her as&#xD;
if she were secured to you by all the chains that church and&#xD;
state can forge, and that is the reason why you take things&#xD;
so coolly, and listen to your pride. But I tell you that it is&#xD;
not as you think. You are Dot forever secure of Catherine.&#xD;
Our moods of mind, and our views of things, change with&#xD;
time. And however the maiden may feel or think now, if&#xD;
you hesitate for years between your pride and love, she will&#xD;
naturally arrive at the conclusion that many a generous&#xD;
hearted woman has come to before her, and ~say to herself,&#xD;
'Well, I cannot be happy myself, but my life n~ust not,&#xD;
therefore, be wasted-I can make some one else~ happy,'~and&#xD;
being scorned by one she loves, give herself away to one&#xD;
who loves her."&#xD;
Major Clifton started to his feet, with all the dark side of&#xD;
his character uppermost, exclaiming-&#xD;
"Let her attempt it! I would stop such a marriage at&#xD;
the altar! Catherine ie mine, or nobody's. She could not&#xD;
repel my claims"&#xD;
"Dear Archer, sit down; do not excite yourself or me.&#xD;
Remember, I am in a dying state," said the lady, as the best&#xD;
means of calming him.&#xD;
"Dear madam, forgive me-forgive me-but why intro..&#xD;
duce this very embarrassing 'aiid highly exciting subject? I&#xD;
have had cpnllict enough in my own bosom about it, I love&#xD;
your favorite, I love 'her jealously, fiercely-I admit it-but&#xD;
there are objections and difficulties, which time, or a new set&#xD;
of circumstances, may remove; meanwhile, I could 'not bear&#xD;
to see her sijatched from me. But there is time enough-&#xD;
even if I should decide upon such a step, there is time&#xD;
enough. Kate is very' young yet."&#xD;
"But yQu;are' not very.yOuIig, Archer."&#xD;
"I know it, dear madam. 'I have arrived at that age at&#xD;
which men do not make imprudent marriages for love~Th&#xD;

lives by your pride? Your hesitation between inclination&#xD;
and prejudice, weakens yen and destroys her."&#xD;
"'Prejudic~s,' dear madam! Well, I suppose they are&#xD;
prejudices, but just think of the horror of having Qarl Kava~&#xD;
nagh, the farm laborer, for a brother4n-law, and being called&#xD;
'ur~cle' by his ragged ptogeny !"&#xD;
"Oh, Archer, your inhumanity shocks me-they are hu-&#xD;
man creatures, after all-this Carl and his family."&#xD;
"And don't you see besides, madam, that if I should&#xD;
marry Catherine, and introduce her into society, the first&#xD;
question would be, 'Who is she?' and the answer by some&#xD;
good-natured friend, 'The sister of one of his farm laborers,'&#xD;
would expose us to contempt, if it did not rule us out of&#xD;
good company."&#xD;
"Archer! Archer! can it be that you weigh these falsi-&#xD;
ties with the deep realities of life ?"&#xD;
"It is a deplorable thing, indeed, that a girl of such noble&#xD;
nature should come of such ignoble pai'entage."&#xD;
"No! it is a congratulatory thing !-.or would be so, if it&#xD;
were not such a usual thing! Archer, you will find more&#xD;
moral worth, and it may ~be more mental worth, among the&#xD;
so-called lower classes, than among the higher; for instance,&#xD;
among the men, look at some of their brows, of Shaksperian&#xD;
height and breadth-think what they would be with cultiva-&#xD;
tion! And I tell you, with all their disadvantages, the lower&#xD;
classes will give to our republic the greatest of her future&#xD;
great men."~&#xD;
Major ~Jiifton remained in deep thought for awhile, and&#xD;
thea/taking the hand of the lady, said-rn&#xD;
"My dear mother, the objections that I have advanced&#xD;
are those that have arisen in my mind, from time to time,&#xD;
giving me much pain. I wished to hold them up before~my-&#xD;
self, as I have just done, in order to see what they really&#xD;
consisted of, and looked like. I have seen the worst of&#xD;
them, and in their ugliest light, and they will not deter me&#xD;
from taking to my heart the girl I love. I have weighed&#xD;
them, and th&amp;amp; whole mass is light in the ~balance with my&#xD;
need of Catherine. II will marry her. I will go and tell&#xD;
her so now. And the ceremony shall be performed whenever&#xD;
you think proper."&#xD;

MAJOR CLIFTON held the note between his finger and'&#xD;
/ thumb, in a fit of abstraction, while a pleasant, contemplative&#xD;
smile dwelt on his face.&#xD;
"Well, are you not going to tinswer it ?" asked Mrs. Clif-&#xD;
ton, adding, "The servant waits."&#xD;
"Oh! answer it! yes! what is it about ?" he exclaimed,&#xD;
starting out of his reverie, and glancing at the note again.&#xD;
Thenihe arose, penned a hasty excuse, and delivering it to&#xD;
the messenger, dispatched him. Returning from this busi-&#xD;
ness, he said, "No, I cannot leave home this evening; since&#xD;
I have come to a decision, I wish to have a good, confidential&#xD;
talk with my little Kate. How much I have to say to her,&#xD;
how Aiuch 'to draw from her, if I can. What a prison de-&#xD;
livery pf thought and emotion it must be on both sides, if I&#xD;
can get her to talk! But she is so shy, excepti.r when under&#xD;
some strong,' disinterested feeling for another. Move her&#xD;
sympathies, and she forgets herself and loses all reserve;&#xD;

The door opened, and Catherine entered, from her' morn-&#xD;
ing's household duties, with her little basket of keys hanging&#xD;
on her arm.&#xD;
"Come hither, dear Kate," said Major Clifton,&#xD;
holding&#xD;
out his hand. Catherine put her little basket in its place,&#xD;

&#xD;
and quietly went to his side~ He encircled her waist with&#xD;
his arm, and holding both her hands captive in his own,&#xD;
looked fondly in her face till she dropped her eyes in con-&#xD;
fusion, and then he said, "Dear Kate, my mother here, who&#xD;
loves you almost as much as I do, if that were possible, wants&#xD;
to know when you will make us both happy, by becoming my&#xD;
wife and her daughter."&#xD;
He paused for an answer, never removing his eyes from&#xD;
their gaze upon her gloving cheek.&#xD;
"Yes, I am very anxious'~to know what day you will give&#xD;
yourself to us entirely, dear child !" said Mrs. Clifton, and&#xD;
she also paused for a reply.&#xD;
Catherine, in extreme confusion, glanced from one to the&#xD;
other, and finally dropped her eyes again.&#xD;
"Come, dearest Kate) it is but a word-the name of some&#xD;
day in the week whispered very low," said Major Clifton, in&#xD;
her ear.&#xD;
"Yes, let it be soon; let it be within a week, dear child.&#xD;
My time is short, Kate, and I wish to bless your marriage&#xD;
before I go hence. You know I told you that I could calcu-&#xD;
late the progress of decay, and the length of life with some&#xD;
accuracy, and I tell you now that my days are num-&#xD;

"Come, Kate, if you cannot speak, give me one of your&#xD;

this time, now burst into tears. lie drew her head up~n his&#xD;
shoulder, where she sobbed awhile, until he stooped and&#xD;
whispered, "Pear Catherine, try to calm yourself-i--do you&#xD;
not~ee bow you ezeita oizr mother ~ there, lift up your head,&#xD;
and go to her; and both of you together arrange all these.&#xD;

he passed her round before him, and stood het beside Mrs.&#xD;

room, with the same happy, half-contemplative smile upon&#xD;

dropping her head upon the lady's lap, wept afresh. The&#xD;

"Thursday, Kate 'P''&#xD;
"Yes, Thursday, dear mother."&#xD;
The lady then embraced and dismissed her, and settled&#xD;
herself back in her chair to take a necessary nap.,&#xD;
Cathei~iite left the parlor in that half~-blissful, half-fearful&#xD;
trance that 'falls upon one when the great' life's desire and&#xD;

hope is about to be rea1ized-4ht~PPY beyond measure, but&#xD;
somewhat incredulous that this could be reallyfaCt~realIY&#xD;
the "sober certainty of waking bliss," and no dream, and&#xD;
foreboding some stroke of fate that should snatch the too&#xD;

branches of the latter burning '~ red that they seemed a-fire&#xD;
in the rays of the afternoon sun. But he turned, to Cathe-&#xD;

of rank and the passion of his soul waAvar, and the strong-&#xD;
est had conquered, and now reigned alone, and a fine, vigor!.&#xD;
ou~, healthful joyousness had taken the place of all reserve&#xD;
and gloom and eccentricity; so great and happy was this&#xD;
change, that Catherine felt no more the strange, shy fear of&#xD;
him that had ever placed her at such disadvantage in his&#xD;
presence. lie led her to a shaded seat at the end of ~ piazza~,&#xD;
where there -wei~e iio intruders but a glancing line of sun-&#xD;
light, and nothing to disturb them louder than th~ rustle of,&#xD;
a falling leaf. A.u&amp;amp; there~ he peered out the long hoarded&#xD;
mysteries of his heart~ talking on and on as the hours passed,&#xD;
until successively the sun went dowp, ~nd the stars; i~e out,&#xD;
and clouds arose and hid them, and shrouded the piazza in&#xD;
darkness. And still he talked-" an' he would. talk, his&#xD;
last," not even heeding the approach of a. servant, until&#xD;
Ilenny's voice was heard, asking Miss Kate to come and give&#xD;
out tea and sugar for supper. Then he arose,~ and half un~&#xD;
mindful of the presence of the maid, he said-&#xD;
"This is very sweet, dear Kate; very, very sweet-to'b~&#xD;

The next day Major Clifton rode over to White Cliffs to&#xD;
pay his respects to Georgia.'&#xD;
The beauty received him with unrestrained joy ~, but' in&#xD;
the conversation that ensued, reverted to what she calle~&#xD;

nagh," asking him i~ he h~d not observed 'a great dhang~&#xD;
in Mrs. Clifton, ascribable entirely to her influence ~&#xD;
It gave Major Clifton great pain to hear Cathei'ine tra.&#xD;
duced in this manner, but he believed Mi's. Georgia to be&#xD;
perf~otly sincere in her opinion, and only the victim of a&#xD;
mistake. He told the 'ladyso, adding-~--&#xD;
am about to give Miss Kavanagh the highest proof&#xD;
of confidence that one being can give another. I am about&#xD;
to take her for ny life's bosom friend. We shall be mar~&#xD;
i'ied in five days."&#xD;
Had a bullet sped through her heart, she could not have&#xD;
given a more agonized bound. Then she struck both hands&#xD;
to her temples, started hastily half across the floor, paused&#xD;
again, as if distracted; and suddenly cried out-.&#xD;
"You sb~dl not do it! By my soul, you shall not do it!&#xD;
You never, never shall become the dupe of that woman!&#xD;
I have entered the lists with her. I mean, th;t to save you,&#xD;
I have done so, and before I leave them, I ill prove her&#xD;
false and treacherous. God show the right !"&#xD;
Major Clifton gazed 'upon her in wonder. The strong emo~.&#xD;
tion that sh~ 'had exhibited, imposed upon him, for there was&#xD;
no doubting its reality; and far from suspecting its cause, an&#xD;
unhallowed 'passion 'for himself, he ascribed it solely to her&#xD;
strong 'conviction of Catherine's niworthiness, and to her&#xD;
disinterested regai'd for itis~ own we1far~. And when she&#xD;

he i'eiiohed Hardbargain as miserable as the doubt of one be-&#xD;

~rioody manner excited some uneasiness in 'the bosoms of the&#xD;
two ladies. ' When Catherine left the room to order dinner,&#xD;
'the conversation that ensued tended' to strengthen his newly&#xD;
revived suspicions. Mrs. Clifton told him, that with his con-&#xD;
s~1it she would like to leave 'the farm of Hardbargain to (4ath-&#xD;
erine, as a testimony of her esteem and affection.&#xD;
"And for a more' practical reason; too,~' she saidht~.for&#xD;
you know, my dear Archer, that the estate of White Cliffs&#xD;
being entailed-if you should die' before her; and without&#xD;
male ehildren~Oatherine and her~ daughters; if she should&#xD;
have any, would be left homeless. IBut if I leave her this&#xD;
farm of Hardbargain,' it can make no difference to you during&#xD;
your life, and if Catherine happen to' survive you, it will se-&#xD;
mire her a home. What do'you think of this plan, Archer ~&#xD;
You look grave and troubled. If you have the slightest&#xD;
objection, LwUl not carry it out, of course."&#xD;
"Surely I have not' the least 'right to object, my dear&#xD;
mother ; ~your property you havO made by your own labor,&#xD;
and improved by your own admirable management."&#xD;
"You have the right of nature, my dear Archer; and' I&#xD;
see by your gravity, that you dislike this arrangement; there-'&#xD;
fore it shall not be made."&#xD;
"You mistake my thoughtfulness, dear madam. If I am&#xD;
somewhat grave, it is upon another subject. Believe me, I&#xD;
have not the slightest fault to find With this plan ;' neither&#xD;
does it take me by surprise, I have been prepared for it mo~'zth~.&#xD;

"Is it possible ~ How could Georgia have known any~&#xD;

,"Certainly, madam, it can make no material difference, if&#xD;
Kate is to be my wife. ~And, if she were not to be so, I should&#xD;

Unconscious of th~ double meaning of' his words, the lady&#xD;
then inquired into the cause 'of hie gloom.&#xD;
"Merely a fit of moodiness, dear mother; the reactions&#xD;
perhaps, of yesterday's joy; a mere depression of spirits,&#xD;
which a brisk gallop over the hills will throw off."&#xD;
"If you are inclined for a ride, Archer, you can do me a&#xD;

TIlE C~IRSE OP CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
A spasm of p~ain passed over the handsome countenance&#xD;
9f Major Clifton, and he said-...&#xD;
"I will do anything you please, dearest mother; but surely&#xD;
there is no necessity for haste in this matter."&#xD;
"Archer, there i.~ Besides, 'ny wind will be easier when&#xD;
it is done. And Archer, lastly~.-bring with you a olergyma~.&#xD;
J ~wi~h to receive the Holy Communion."&#xD;
Major V~ifton made no farther objection, but left the room&#xD;
to order his horse; and in less than half an hour he found&#xD;
himself on his way to 2L-~-.-. Mrs. Clifton summoned&#xD;
Kate. When the girl entered, she found the lady on the&#xD;
verge of fainting from over-exertion and extreme weakness.&#xD;
Catherine grew pale with sudden fear, and her hands trem-&#xD;
bled as she poured out and, administered a restorative. Some..&#xD;
what revived by the cordial, Mrs. Ulifton ~aid~-.&#xD;
"Kate, write two notes, one to Mrs. Georgia Clifton, and&#xD;
one to your brother Carl, asking each of them to come here&#xD;
this evening to witness a deed-~r rather two of them, my&#xD;
dear Kate-.-.the signing of my last will and testament, and&#xD;
the solemnization of your marriage-..for both must be has-&#xD;
tened, Kate. 'My dear child, take your pen and write at&#xD;
once."&#xD;
Dee~ily troubled, extremely agitated, yet struggling tc&#xD;
govern her feelings, Catherine found the writing materials&#xD;
and penned the twQ notes; but when she had finished them,&#xD;
~w~he~ahstraction of her great grief, she misdirected them-&#xD;
~nd sei~t the note intended' for Mrs. Georgia to Carl Ka-&#xD;
v~nagh, and that intended for Carl to Mrs. Georgia. When&#xD;
she Jw~d dispatched these Dotes by different messengers, and&#xD;
reti~pe&amp;amp;4o the parlor,. Mrs. Clifton said..-..&#xD;
* "Call Uenny, my dear l~ate,, and let her assist you in&#xD;
getting me up stairs. It has come at last, Kate."&#xD;
Alnlost.~disrn&amp;amp;ycd by sorrow, Catherine rung the bell that&#xD;
Jwught the. Servants into the. room. And between them&#xD;
they raised the lady to her feet. Mrs~ Clifton~ took a long&#xD;
look around the room, as though she were taking a last leave&#xD;
of every dear familiar object in it; and then suffered her.~&#xD;
self to be supported up to her cha'nber.&#xD;
Mrs. Georgia Clifton was pacing her chamber floor, in all&#xD;
the distraction of excited. evil passions, racking her brain for&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ~UE~SE OF OLIFTONi&#xD;
&#xD;
"37&#xD;
&#xD;
an expedient to ruin her rival and break off. the impending&#xD;
marriage, when the "spirits that tend on mort4 thoughts,"&#xD;
furnished her with one. A messenger entered and handed&#xD;
her a sealed envelope, directed in the handwriting of Cathe-&#xD;
rine Kavanagh. She opened it in. surprise, curiosity, and&#xD;
even in some degree of vague, guilty fear, and found within&#xD;
the misdirected note of Kate to Carl. It read simply as&#xD;
follows:&#xD;
"DEAR CARL :-~&#xD;
"Mrs. Clifton is almost dying. She says you must come to&#xD;
the house this afternoon, at four o'clock, to meet a lawyer&#xD;
and a clergyman, and with Mrs. Georgia Clifton, to witness&#xD;
the signing of her last will, and also niy marriage. Do not&#xD;
keep her waiting.                ~~CATHERJNE."&#xD;
This note contained no expression of esteem or affection&#xD;
for the invalid, or regret at her approaching death. No! for&#xD;
Catherine's veneration and sorrow were too earnest, too real,&#xD;
to be a matter of wordy formula. But in the evil heart of&#xD;
Georgia this simplicity was turned against the girl. And her&#xD;
first idea, revealed4 in her smile of satisfaction, was to show&#xD;
this mis-sent note to Archer Clifton, and bid him look and&#xD;
see with what perfect coolness and indifference the writer&#xD;
could announce the approaching demise of her benefactress.&#xD;
But while this thought was. revolving in her mind, Satan&#xD;
suggested a surer pIan~-a deadly stratagem. And ~t this&#xD;
inspiration of the fiend, the idark face of ~he baleful 'woman&#xD;
lighted up with demoniac joy. She seize4~ the note again,&#xD;
and rushed to the window, and scanned \the han4-~riting&#xD;
Georgia inherited all the imitatiye talent ~f her father, the&#xD;
portrait-painter. Catherine's handwriting was nniq~ue : ~snall,&#xD;
square letters, with heavy strokes, a chirogaphy peculiar, to&#xD;
herself, yet easily imitated. Mrs. Georgia copied *a few&#xD;
selected words~compared them with the originals, and was&#xD;
satisfied with her work. Next she wished to procure note&#xD;
paper, exactly like it. Catherine's note was written upon&#xD;
neutral~tinted paper, that had been given her by Major&#xD;
Clifton. Mrs. Georgia recognized it as some, that had be-&#xD;
longed to him. She thought there might possibly be a few&#xD;
stray sheets in the writing-table of the library. She went&#xD;
thither, and after a diligent search, found a single sheet.&#xD;
This she took with her, and returned t~ her chamber, locked&#xD;
herself in, and sat down to her fiendish task. Perfectly&#xD;

"Certainly, my dear mother, it shall be as you desire,"&#xD;
he replied, repressing a great groan-but desirous, above aU&#xD;
things, to gratify that dying parent. "Shall it be now,&#xD;
mother ?"&#xD;
"No, dear Archer, not just yet-I want the holiest things&#xD;
left for the last-I want the will drawn up, witnessed, signed&#xD;

them."&#xD;
Arclwr Clifton bent and kissea his mother's forehead, and&#xD;
went down stairs. In the hall he saw Carl Kavanagh, hat&#xD;
in hand, waiting.&#xD;
Carl immediately advanced? and said-&#xD;
"Ah! Major Clifton, I am waiting here to see my sister,&#xD;
to return to her this note, that she has sent me by mistake..&#xD;
I t~ink~perh5p5 you can explain it." And he handed to&#xD;
Archer Clifton the mis-sent note .of Catherine to Georgia.&#xD;
Major Clifton understood the mistake at once, and retain-&#xD;
ing the note, replied-&#xD;
"Catherine wrote two notes, summoning yourself and Mrs.&#xD;

the signature of a certain document. She placed them in&#xD;

Pray remain here, while I ride over home,'aftd bring Mrs.&#xD;

Carl. Kavanagh sat down in the hall, and Major Clifton&#xD;
mounted a fresh horse, and galloped over to White Cliffs.&#xD;
Dismounthig at the gate, h~ threw the reins to a servant,&#xD;
and entering the house, sent a message to Mrs. Georgia.&#xD;
The servant returned, and requesting Major Clifton to fol-&#xD;

he exclaimed-" Mrs. Clifton, you know my errand here-it&#xD;

mnan.T At-one instant she was impelled to seize. the 'forged&#xD;
letter, and rush to the death-bed of Mrs. Clifton, and there&#xD;
denounce her favorite as a hypocrite and a traitress. I3ut a&#xD;
moitient's' reflection con~rin~ed her that no art of. hers could&#xD;
*iaduce- the dying woman to think evil of the excellentgirl 4e&#xD;
herself had educated. That on the contrary, such a step might&#xD;
possibly result 'in her own signal defeat and exposure, and&#xD;
the everlasting anger and contempt of Archer Clifton. her&#xD;
brain was beginning to reel, and her self-confidence to wane.&#xD;
In sudden fear she looked around for the forged letter, in-&#xD;
tending to burn it. It was nowhere to be' seen. Then she&#xD;
recollected that Major Clifton had, on departing, picked it&#xD;
tip, and - put it in his pocket. - And- sick with disappointed&#xD;
love; jealousy, batied, and- fear, sha tottered towards a lounge,&#xD;
- -but ere she reached it, fell upon the floor. In the meanwhile,&#xD;
Major Clifton, riding at full speed, reached' the farm honse.&#xD;
On reaching Hardbargain, Major Clifton went immediately&#xD;
to Mrs. Clifton's chamber. lie found her still sinking.. She&#xD;
inquired, in a faint voice, whether' he -had brought Mrs.&#xD;
Georgia. lie replied, with perhaps a pardonable ambiguity&#xD;
of speech, that Mrs. Georgia was too much indisposed to at-&#xD;
tend. Then she said that she supposed Mr. White (the&#xD;
clergyman) would consent to act in~her stead. She informed&#xD;
him that the attorney had been with her, and had drawn up&#xD;
her will according to her instruction, and she requested that&#xD;
the parties might be assembled in her room to witness the&#xD;
signing. Major Clifton left the chamber to summon them 'and&#xD;
soon returned, accompanied by the lai~yer, the mifii~ter,'Car1&#xD;
Kavanagh and Catherine. The will was then read, after which&#xD;
'the lady was raised up in bed, and supported in the arms of&#xD;
he&amp;amp;'son; the document was placed upon a portfolio tin'd laid&#xD;
l~efore her, and a pen dipped in ink and presented to her.&#xD;
She signed her name, and immediately sank back exhausted.&#xD;
The twTo witnesses affixed their signatures, and the will was&#xD;
delivered into the custody of the attorney. A restorative&#xD;
was administered to the invalid, 'and she was arranged com-&#xD;
fortably upon her pillows. Then she ~.took the hand of her&#xD;
son, and whispered.-.-.&#xD;
"Let the marriage ceremony be performed at once, dearest&#xD;
Archer."&#xD;
lie pressed that wan hand,~laid it tenderly down upon-the&#xD;
cove4et, and spoke apart with the clergynian, who occupied&#xD;
the chair beside the head of the be&amp;amp;- The 'ihinist~r solemnly&#xD;
&#xD;
arose, drew a prayer-book from his pocket a~d opened it.&#xD;
Major Clifton went quietly and spoke a few words in expla-&#xD;
nation to the lawyer and Carl Kavanagh, who then approached&#xD;
the bed-side. Lastly, he took the hand- of-Catherine, and led&#xD;
her up before the minister. The marriage ceremony- com-&#xD;
menced.' It was performed according- to the ritu4 of the&#xD;
Protestant Episcopal Church. But when the great question&#xD;
was put to the bridegroom-" Archer, 'wilt thou have this&#xD;
woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together, after God's&#xD;
ordinance, in the holy estate of matrimony V Wilt thou love&#xD;
her, comfort her, honor' her,'" etc.-instead of answering,&#xD;
according to the ritual, "I will," he' replied by a grave and&#xD;
formal bow, with silent 11ps, "that scarce their scorn for-i&#xD;
bore." When the corresponding question was' put to the&#xD;
bride, 'Kate too replied by 'a gentle inclination of the head,&#xD;
but her true heart responded sincerely, earnestly. When&#xD;
the last benediction was given, and when, according to'the&#xD;
old formula, the bridegroom was to salute his bride, he merely&#xD;
torched her cheek with cold lips, and passed her on to his&#xD;
mother, who held out her arms to embrace her daughter.&#xD;
The singularity of Major Clifton's manner was scarcely no-&#xD;
ticed, or it was ascribed to 'the solemnity of the attending&#xD;
circumstances. Mrs.' Ofifton now desired tliat all, with the&#xD;
exception of her son and daughter and the clergyman, should&#xD;
bid her adieu and leave the room. - 11cr request was complied&#xD;
with, and when they had retired, she signified her wish to&#xD;
partake of the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper with her chil-&#xD;
dren. Major Clifton was constrained to decline, upon con-&#xD;
scientious scruples; for how could he partake of the Sacra-&#xD;
ment of peace and brotherly lovewith his heart consumed&#xD;
with indignation against his newly.rharried bride ~ Catherine,&#xD;
however, participated in' the Holy Communion, while he&#xD;
looked on with surprise, mixed with 'a degree of horror.&#xD;
When the sacred rite was over, the minister of God took an&#xD;
affectionate leave, and departed. 'When the minister was&#xD;
gone, and they were left alone together, the dying mother&#xD;
beckoned her son and daughter to come and sit near her.&#xD;
They obeyed her, and she addressed them a few words~ of&#xD;
earnest, affectionate counsel, blessed them, and resigned her-&#xD;
self to rest. Her eyelids closed calmly, and her breathing&#xD;
was gentle and regular; they had to mark attentively before&#xD;
they knew that it greu~ fainter and fainter. Once she opened&#xD;
her eyes, and, smiling her old; reflecting smile, said-&#xD;

"Dear Archer, I have often tried to detect thc exact mo-&#xD;
1ne~t of falling asleep. I watch now, to see if I can seize&#xD;
the precise instant of passing from mortal to immortal life."&#xD;
And she closed her eyes again. After a few minutes, she&#xD;
said-~-&#xD;
"Sing fo me, dear Kate! You know-Ileber's death&#xD;
hymn."&#xD;
Catheiine bent and kissed the pallid lips of the dying wo~&#xD;
man~ and then her voice arose, sweet, clear and' spiritual as&#xD;
angels' songs, in that immortal z~equisni.-..&#xD;
"Vital spark of heavenly flame,&#xD;

'At the end of the first stanza, she murmured, faintly-.-.~&#xD;
"Your voice, too, dear Archer."&#xD;
His voice arose now in unison with Catherine's, and they&#xD;
sang the remainder-&#xD;
"The world recedes--it disappears:&#xD;
heaven opens on my eyes; my ears&#xD;
With sounds seraphie ring.&#xD;
Lend, lend your wing~; I mount, I fly!&#xD;
01w, grave, where is thy victory?&#xD;
Oh, death; where is th~r sting?"&#xD;
They ceased, and looked' upon the marble face before&#xD;
them. It. was still in death, but there remained upon the&#xD;
countenance the impress of the ecstatic smile with which the&#xD;
spirit bi~d taken its flight-.-&#xD;
"Her death&#xD;

* THE POISON WORKS.&#xD;
'Tis stander;&#xD;
Whose edge is sharper than the sword; whose tongue&#xD;
Q~itvenoms all the worms of the $ile..-SuA1sEAR~.&#xD;
Wiip i. Archer Clifton saw that all indeed was over; when&#xD;
he looked up~n that mother-face, ,the first which had ever met&#xD;
his conscious gaze in life; that old, familiar face, which&#xD;
seemed to him coeval with. his being, and a necessary part&#xD;
of it; that face the most intimate, the most loving, the most~&#xD;
faithful which bad ever shone 'upon his path of life ;-and&#xD;
felt that it was lost forever; that the light of those quiet,&#xD;
eyes was darkened fore'vet; the sound of that kind voice&#xD;
silenced forever; the smile of those calm lips fled forever ;-&#xD;
when he clasped tl~it 'mother"hand, and felt that' those dear,&#xD;
fingers wonid close upon his own in cordial grasp never, never&#xD;
more ;.-~-oh! when JAe'felt that all was over, over, "finished,&#xD;
done and ended," he tell upon his knees by the corpse,&#xD;
dropped his head upon the cold, inanimate bosom, and broke&#xD;
into convulsive sobs.&#xD;
Weeping freely, Catherine knelt by his side, and 'put her&#xD;
arm around his neck. lie was unconscious of her presence,&#xD;
until, after giving way to sorrow for a few~ moments, she&#xD;
lifted up her head, and wiped her eyes, and controlling her&#xD;
own emotion, sought to console him.-&#xD;
'"iDo not grieve so, dear Archer," she. murmured, with&#xD;
her arm again around him, "do not grieve, but pray."&#xD;
Then indeed he suddenly grew calm, unclasped the gentle&#xD;
arm of Catherine from his neck, arose slowly from his kneel-&#xD;
ing posture, took her hand, and raised her upon' her feet, and&#xD;
regarding her with a stern and sorrowful countenance, said,&#xD;
in severe rebuke-'&#xD;
"Come ! madam! no1 mor~ hypocrisy now! None here&#xD;
at least! It is useless hereafter! You have accomplished.&#xD;
your design.' You are a 'successful diplomatist,' and your&#xD;
'long slavery' is now over.~~&#xD;

&#xD;
Catherine lifted her eyes, dilated with sorrow and amaze-&#xD;
ment, and fixed them on his. face an instant; but the look&#xD;
she met there, the expression of mingled suffering and se-&#xD;
verity, such as might have sat upon the brow of Brutus,&#xD;
when the feelings of 'the' man andi th&amp;amp; duty of the judge&#xD;
strove in his bosom, awed her into silence before him. She&#xD;
could express no surprise or grief~-.-ask no explanation. The&#xD;
old shyness and fear came over her, and her eyes fell, and&#xD;
her cheeks paled. Again he spoke in the same stern, sor-&#xD;
rowful tofre~-&#xD;
"Ay, cower with conscious guilt! You are' discovered!&#xD;
And you should have 'been unmasked before her to-day, but&#xD;
that I did not wish to' embitter her last' moment! that only&#xD;
sa'~ed you! Come! leave the room that you desecrate with&#xD;
~tour ~resenoer!' Leave me alouie' wit'h'my dead !"&#xD;
Bixt~ instead, of obeying, she ~stood like a statue before&#xD;

Then he took her hand and led he~ through the door, and&#xD;
closed it 'b~lxi~d her.&#xD;
'Ca~therine~ood' there where~he had placed her, amazed,&#xD;
eonf6und~d, iix~able to move a step fi~rwa~rd, until th~ thought&#xD;

Cat'h&amp;amp;rine' on' the' st~irs,~ and his stern, averted countenance&#xD;
at that moment "almost' broke her heart. But she went on&#xD;
enduringly with her tasks. Often she 'raised her soul in&#xD;

"I desire that you keep your chamber to-morrow, or, at&#xD;
least, refrain from insulting the inetnory of the. dead, by ap-&#xD;
pearingat the funeral.       ARCHER CLIFTON."&#xD;
She nodded her head ~Iowly, meditatively, with a look of&#xD;
sweetest resignation; then beckoned Iknny to follow her, and&#xD;
returned to her chamber. There she sat down and wrote the&#xD;
following note-&#xD;
"I will absent myself from the funeral, since you wish me&#xD;
to. do so;' T will also keep my room, if you desire it, when I&#xD;
remind you that there is no one ~to supply my place in the&#xD;
household arrangements for the solemnities of the day.&#xD;
"CATHERINE."&#xD;
She s~nt this by Henny, but received no reply to it. Con-&#xD;
struing silence into consent, she went about the house as&#xD;
usual attending to her duties.&#xD;
In .th&amp;amp; meantime, Mttjor Clifton sat in his study, awaiting&#xD;
an answer to a note he had written to Mrs. Georgia, apprising&#xD;
her of the recent events, and requesting her to come at 'oncO&#xD;
to the house. He had not to waitr long; hi&amp;amp;~me~seii~er re-&#xD;

Carl, .whose face, expressed the most profound and sincere&#xD;
sympathy.&#xD;

"I should think so, sir !" coldly remarked Major Clifton.&#xD;
"She speaks of. letting me the' farm! I never had the&#xD;
slightest. desire to rent the farm, and before I heard the will&#xD;
read, I had n~t'even the slightest idea that Mrs. Clifton de..&#xD;
signed to leave' it to my sister!"&#xD;
"Ah!. .'R~aJiy ?" ~asked Mr. Clifton, ironically.&#xD;
"Really ,and 'truly~, and sincerely and positively, I had&#xD;
not~"&#xD;
"Tautological asseveration is no evidence. Why should&#xD;
she have written to you thus if you had not ?"&#xD;
'"How d~ I know, sir ~ I tell' you I am amazed! And&#xD;
if 1. did not know, beyond all possibility of doubt, the hand-'&#xD;
writing to be Catherine's, I should say that she did not' write,&#xD;
and that she never could have written such a letter."&#xD;
"Which means plainly this, that if there did not exist the&#xD;
most positive proof to the contrary, you would fain deny it,"&#xD;
sneered Major Clifton.&#xD;
"Yes, sir !" answered Carl, boldly. "If the proof posi-&#xD;
tive to my mind, as well as to your own did not exist, I would&#xD;
deny it, and I do deny any personal agency or knowledge&#xD;
about it whatever!' I say to you that I am amazed!. It is&#xD;
incomprehensible' tQ me how Catherine eouldhave conceived,&#xD;
~nuoh lese written such a letter! And above all things, it is&#xD;
inexplicable how she should have written so disrespectfully&#xD;
of Mrs. Clifton, whom she loved and venerated so much."&#xD;
"Or 'whom,, for certain purposes, she ~pretended to love&#xD;
an~ venerate so much."&#xD;
"She a~id, sir! She really did. She was sincere in her&#xD;
esteem and affection. 'She w~as sincere in' all things.",&#xD;

"It was 'no affectation, Major Clifton. I have known her&#xD;
from childhood-it was truth. And I tell you, I scarcely&#xD;
believe my own eyes! I scarcely believe that I am awake&#xD;
when I see that letter! 'I am confounded !"&#xD;

TIlE CURSE OF CLIFTON.          149&#xD;
There was something of Catherine's own nobility in the&#xD;
manner of Carl's reply. He stood a moment with his fore-&#xD;
head thrown back, as if incalm, unimpassioned thought, then&#xD;
he said-&#xD;
" Major Clifton, my sister is now your wife, and you have,&#xD;
doubtless, the perfect right to control her actions-neither&#xD;
do I accuse you of undue severity in this affair, for, under&#xD;
like circumstances, I should, perhaps, be tempted to act in&#xD;
the same way. I cannot account for this letter. For' the&#xD;
present, it must remain unexplained. Nor can I exculpate&#xD;
myself any more than my sister from the odium of a suspicion,&#xD;
which God knows I am willing to bear with her, since II can-&#xD;
not clear hei~ of it. You do not l~now how dear to an only&#xD;
brother's heart is his. only sister. Yes! I am willing to share&#xD;
the odium with her, hoping, knowing that it will pass away&#xD;
in time. And then, Major Clifton, you will feel ~more pain&#xD;
at the recollection of the injustice you have done us, than I&#xD;
feel now in suffering it. You will be more augry with your-&#xD;
self than I could be with you. You will reproach yourself&#xD;
more bitterly than I could reproach you, were I never so in-&#xD;
dignant. And I am not indignant at all! I could not be&#xD;
so! All feelings are subdued to calmness in the sacred&#xD;
proximity of the unburied dead in the nest room. One thing&#xD;
only remains to be said. It is this: I camiot continue to&#xD;
live upon this place, under the cloud of the niaster's ilL.&#xD;
opinion. . My engagement as manager of this farm terminateS&#xD;
with this year,' I shall be glad, if before the time expires,&#xD;
you will provide yourself with another overseer.~,&#xD;
"As you please, Mr. Kavanagh. Yet I should not have&#xD;
sent you away with your young family."&#xD;
"You are considerate, sir !" said Carl, bowing, then add-&#xD;
ing-.-." I ,presume you have no further commands for me,&#xD;

"None, Mr. Kavanagh."&#xD;
"Good-night, sir."&#xD;
"Good-night."&#xD;
The next day was the day of the funeral. Before the peo-&#xD;
ple began to assemble, Catherine, impelled by an irresistible&#xD;
desire to gaze once more upon the face of her beloved friend,&#xD;
found herself at the door of the front parlor in which the&#xD;
corpse was laid out for burial. But here, with her hand&#xD;
upon the lock, she hesitated~ and finally stifling her crying&#xD;
want, turned away, saying within herself-" No, I will not&#xD;

Jotter of his commands. He will not accept my love. To&#xD;
yield hin~ perfect unquestioning obedience is all the earthly&#xD;
comfort I have left." And she began to retrace her steps.&#xD;
Major Clifton came out of the back room and met her face&#xD;
to face.                     -&#xD;
"What were you doing near that door, Catherinc ?"&#xD;
I wished to take a last look at her dear.-" Here Kate&#xD;
burst into tears and wept convulsively a few minutes-.~during&#xD;
which, Clifton watched her in stern sortow. Then controlling&#xD;
herself, she said, "I wished to look once more, and for the&#xD;
last time, upon her beloved face. But wh~en I reached the&#xD;
door, and was about to enter, I remembered your commands&#xD;
and turned back."&#xD;
* Clifton, who had never taken -his eyes from her, groaned&#xD;
aloud.' Then he, said, gravely and sadly-.&#xD;
"Catherine, if any feeling of penitential sorrow. inspires&#xD;
your wish to go there, go, in Heaven's name! And ma the&#xD;
sight of that dead face bring you to repentance." ~&#xD;
She turned to thank, him, and ask him what he wished her&#xD;
to repent-but before-she could find words, he had re-entered&#xD;
his study Catherine passed into the room of death, turned&#xD;
down the pall, and gazed upon the face of the dead. 'It had&#xD;
changed very much-every furrow and every wrinkle was&#xD;
softened out of it, the forehead was as smooth as the brow&#xD;
of chddhood, an ineffable divine repose. spread like a dteam&#xD;
of Heaven over the features. Catherine's tears were stayed,&#xD;
the convulsions of her bosom were calmed, her soul was awed&#xD;
and exalted as she gazed upon this conutenance, so beautiful&#xD;
in death. 'But at last her full heart revealed itSelf in a look&#xD;
of unutterable tenderness and devotion, and she 'murmured,&#xD;
in low,, slow, gentle tones-" You always loved and trusted&#xD;

'-not to abuse her privilege by too 'long a stay-slowly left&#xD;
the room.' She never saw that face again. -&#xD;
Within an hour afterwards, the 'company began to assemble&#xD;
in great crowds, for Mrs. Clifton was widely known and&#xD;
greatly respected and beloved. ~The clergyman, who was to&#xD;
perform the burial service, arrived, and the solemnity com-.&#xD;
menced. In the mean time Catherine sat in her distant&#xD;
chamber, listening to' the faint, inaudible sound of the min-&#xD;
ister's voice that reached her from afar, or else, engaged in&#xD;
prayer, but always calmed, strengthened and consoled. Many&#xD;
peopl&amp;amp; at the funeral wondered greatly why the young bride&#xD;
had not appeared with ~her husband; but some one imagined&#xD;
it to be because she was too much overcome by. sorrow to be&#xD;
present, and told it as a fact, which was at once believed, and&#xD;
circulated. Ansi. that.-like many an other idle falsehood,&#xD;
satisfactorily silenced conjecture. When the services were&#xD;
over, and the funeral procession had left the house for the&#xD;
grave~yard-when Catherine felt that her more than mother&#xD;
was now indeed gone, gone, gone-she cast herself upon her&#xD;
bed in the last agony of sorrow.&#xD;
Little household cares. What blessed though humble&#xD;
ministers to sorrow they are-gently drawing away the mourn-&#xD;
er from the contemplation of her grief, and compelling atten-&#xD;
tion to themselves. So they give~, occupation, and induce&#xD;
forgetfulnes5~aiding in their humble way the great comfort-&#xD;
ers, religion and time. An hour spent in bitter tears and sobs,&#xD;
and then the little domestic duties came ho~rering about her&#xD;
like little children, claiming her care. There was a large sup-&#xD;
per to be prepared, and bed-chambers to be got ready for&#xD;
friemb who had come from the remoter parts of ~he county,&#xD;
and who would therefore remain until the' next morning.&#xD;
And ~o Catherine arose and refreshed herself with cold water&#xD;
and a change of 'dress, and dent below stairs to superintend&#xD;
the operations of her cook and house-miiaids.&#xD;
When everything was in readiness, she went into the draw-&#xD;
in~-room, where she received the returning visitors with a&#xD;
pensive, gentle dignity that won all their hearts, proud con~-&#xD;
servators-of rank a~ they were.' And that evening, young&#xD;
girl and new bride as she was, she presided at the head of&#xD;
the long table, filled with' the county aristocrats, with all the&#xD;
ease and grace of a lady " to the manner born."' Preoccu-&#xD;
pied by one earnest thought and purpose, she never once re-&#xD;

troubled herself with the question of what might be their&#xD;
opinion of her. For the rest, her courtesy wa~ graceful and&#xD;
dignified, because it was natural, and not assumed-the effect&#xD;
of benevolence and kindly social feeling, and not of pride,&#xD;
vanity, or ostentation.&#xD;
The next morning, after breakfast, the guests departed.&#xD;
And many and cordial were th~ invitations to their houses&#xD;
extended to Catherine by all--.even the haughtiest defenders&#xD;
of the sacredness of caste. Catherine received all these&#xD;
civilities with a gracious nobleness, that sat naturally 'and&#xD;
well upon her. .And all this-the very evident esteem and&#xD;
respect of her neighbors, and the admirable manner in which&#xD;
Catherine received them, would have highly gratified the&#xD;
pride of Major Clifton, could anything except her exculpa-&#xD;
tion from suspicion have pleased him. As it was, he witnessed&#xD;
it all with a moody brow, and sneering lip, and murmured&#xD;
to himself-&#xD;
"Better and better, 'Maria Teresa.' You should have&#xD;

something to her, something to explain the nature of that&#xD;
dark cloud that had arisen so strangely between them.&#xD;
He broke the silence by saying, coldly-v-.&#xD;
"Mrs. Clifton-.-." ~he started and colored, at hearing&#xD;
herself addressefl~ by her new' name. "It is my intention to&#xD;
make White Cliffs our future home. I desire that you b~&#xD;
ready to accompany me thither to-morrow morning."&#xD;
Catherine bowed her head in acquiescence. And with a&#xD;
cold nod, he placed his hat upon his head, and walked forth.&#xD;
Catherine went in~ and occupied the remainder of the day&#xD;
in directing the labor of her servants, who were all employed&#xD;
in setting4he house'jn order after the late, confusing events,&#xD;
in packing away goods, ~and e9vering up furniture, and in&#xD;
preparing generally for the closing up of the building.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXII.&#xD;
* DEDICATION.&#xD;
Stand up, look below,&#xD;
It is my life at thy feet I throw,&#xD;
To step with ipto light and joy,&#xD;
Nota power of life but I'll em ploy&#xD;
To satisfy thy nature's want.-BRoWNING.&#xD;
THE next morning after breakfast, the family carriage was&#xD;
announced to take them to White Cliffs. Catherine put on&#xD;
her bonnet and shawl, az~d stood waiting, until Major Clifton,&#xD;
draWing on his gloves, csuue forward, and attended' her to the&#xD;
carriage door. He handed her in, entered himself, took the&#xD;
Beat opposite to her, and bade the coachman drive~ on. The&#xD;
whole distance 'between. ,Hardbargain and White Cliffs was&#xD;
passed rover in perfect silence by the parties. Major Clifton&#xD;
preserving a stern gravity 'of demeanor, and Catherine&#xD;
scarcely daring to lift her eyes, lest she 'should encounter&#xD;
that severe but sorrowful gaze that almost 'broke her heart.&#xD;
She longed to inquire-&#xD;
"'Oh, Major Clifton'! 'What is this that has arisen between&#xD;
us ~ Give ~the misery. a i~ame ! Tell ~eV" But 'the shy-&#xD;
ness and fear she had always felt in his presence, and doubly&#xD;
felt when he wait reserved or disple~ed,' and above all, the&#xD;
bashfulness of new bridehood, forced her' into silence.&#xD;
At last the ride' was over,' and the carriage stopped before&#xD;
the m~ju entrance of 'the inansion4aouse.&#xD;
The' plantation laborers, in their boiyda.y clothes, mar-&#xD;
shalled by the overseer, were .assembled~ upon the lawn, and&#xD;
the house servante in'their "Sutiday's'best," with the house"&#xD;
keeper at their head, waited on the piazza "to pay tKeir&#xD;
duty.'?&#xD;
When the carriage haa drawn up, Major listenn alighted~&#xD;
and assisted his bride to get out. He led~ her up'the marble&#xD;
stairs to the fr6nt door. The housekeeper with a curtsey,&#xD;

TilE CURSE' OF 'GL1FTON~.&#xD;
&#xD;
stepped forward to attend her. But with the courteous&#xD;
kindness that Major Clifton seldom omitted, he waved her&#xD;
aside, merely saying-&#xD;
"Mrs. Mercer, send all these women about their duties,&#xD;
and tell Turnbull' to disperse the men. I do not wish to be&#xD;
disturbed.' There is my pocket-bopk-~.-give them what they&#xD;
want-only let me be quiet."&#xD;
"And' give them my love and good-wishes," murmured&#xD;
Catherine, shyly, but not wishing. t~ dismiss' them so coldly,&#xD;
for her desolate heart had been comforted by the looks of&#xD;
sincere respect and affection with which they had seemed to&#xD;
receive and accept her as their new mistress.&#xD;
Major Clifton merely threw upliis chin 'with an assenting&#xD;
nQd, muttering-&#xD;
"The popularity-seeking instinct of the diplomatist." He&#xD;
'then conducted her into the drawing-room, led her up its&#xD;
whole length,'and seated her upon a sofa with ironical cere-&#xD;
mony, saying-...&#xD;
"Mrs.'Ciifton, you are welcome to White Cliffs."&#xD;
Startled by his tone, she looked up, lifting those long,&#xD;
drooping lashes, until her soft, dark eyes at last met his cold,&#xD;
rebuking gaze.&#xD;
Then 1is who4p aspect changed, and 'from' having been sar~&#xD;
castle and scornful, became graveand severe. Standing' be~&#xD;
fore her, he folded his arms, drew himself up, and keeping&#xD;
his eyes fixed steadily upon her faee~ said..-.. '&#xD;
"And now, ~lady, listen to me. The aim and' object of&#xD;
yoi4ir life is accomplished-consummated. ' You have at&#xD;

~All this time her~ eyes, wide open, dilated; fascinated by&#xD;
surprise and grief, met 'his stern gaze in sorrowful wonder.&#xD;
He continued-.-'&#xD;
'"Yes, ~madaw, you wear xkxy name such as it is! You&#xD;

And so abruptly h~ ~turned upon his heel and left her.&#xD;
One mon~ent Bhe 8at there amazed, &amp;amp;~nfiiscd, with her hands&#xD;
pressed upenJier temples; and. in another, losing all feeling&#xD;
for herself-feeling only for him,, she sprung to. 'his side, and&#xD;
caught his hand, exclaiming-&#xD;
"Stay! For the love of fleaven, stay! one monient-.&#xD;
only one moment, while you tell me. Oh! after all, have I.&#xD;

"JV'othing but refrain from troubling rn~ with your com-&#xD;

clasp, and left the r~o~n.&#xD;
She tottered backwards and fell into a chair, her head&#xD;
droppedupon her hands and she gasped~-&#xD;
"All-merciful Father, do not forsake me now, for I am&#xD;
desolate-I am. desolate." And ah~1sat despairing, fallen,&#xD;
the very image of utter seltabandqnfl2ent. She sat there&#xD;
until aroused by the voice of the ' housekeeper, who entered&#xD;
the room, came up 1~o TIer side, and spoke to her twice before&#xD;
she hear4-then~.-" What did you say!4 she asked.&#xD;
"I have come to receive your orders for the day, Mrs.&#xD;

I-I am not well-and very,, very weary.&#xD;
"You look so, indeed~ madam. There is a fire kindled in&#xD;

bring you a cup of tea!'&#xD;

~C        No, I thank you-I am much obliged to you.&#xD;
But-only'leave'nie here to rest.'7&#xD;
The housekeeper went 'and closed the shutters: stirred the&#xD;
fire, set a screen between it and Catherine's seat, and quietly&#xD;
Withdrew.&#xD;
"Oh! this will never do !" said Catherine, trying to rouse'&#xD;
herself from her stupor of despair. "This will never do.&#xD;
To-day I' fiave 'made 'a bad beginning; but to-morrow I must&#xD;
rise and 'be as actiVe. anwi efficient as if I were happy."&#xD;
She met Majoi~ Clifton again at dinner. The meal passed&#xD;
almost in silence, 'aiid'inmie'diately after it waSover, 1he took&#xD;
his hat and left the house, ~She did not see 'him again until&#xD;
tea-time, ~fter which, lie w~ and spent ~the evening in his&#xD;
study. Catherine felt the need of calm thought, to under-&#xD;
stand her ~6sitiqn and duties; and of player, to gain strength&#xD;
and patience to~erform them. She spent ~e~eral hours in&#xD;
reading the Scriptures, in meditation,~ and in prayer, and&#xD;
then; comforted, retired to bed.' She arose early the next&#xD;
morning, strengthened sand consoled, with a very clear per-&#xD;
~eption' of her circumstances and responsibilities.&#xD;
"My path through this intricate trouble is made very&#xD;
plain. I must discharge every domestic. duty and every&#xD;
Social obligation, ~just as &amp;amp;ithfully, if not as cheerfiuly, as&#xD;
though I were a happy wife," she said. And she went down&#xD;
stairsand gave her orders fi~r the day.&#xD;
When ~aj6r Vlifton came down into the broalcgast-room&#xD;
lie 'found a quiet' cheerful scene--a sunny window, a bright&#xD;
fire, a well, spread breakfast-table, and Catherine herself, in&#xD;
her simple morning-dress; looking calm and placid. There&#xD;
wa8 an expression of Curi&amp;amp;usly blended anger and admiration&#xD;
~nd amusement '6n his face, as he flapped his dressing..gown&#xD;
'around' him, and 'dropped himself into the easy-chair by the&#xD;
fire, giving her "Good-morning," and hoping that 'she iras&#xD;
well.&#xD;
"As usual," replied Cathe4ne,' handing him the paper&#xD;
that h~d just come from the village, and ringing for break-&#xD;
fast. '&#xD;
When the meal was over, he reseated himself in the arm-&#xD;
'chair, 'reading th9 newspaper, while Catherine still sat at the&#xD;
board~ pouring out bowls of coffee, aiid, filling plates with&#xD;
toast, or' x~ifthi~, 'to send to the old or' ~jck among the ne-&#xD;
~grOe44Iiese bsing~always'supplied with their meals' from the&#xD;
mistress's table. Major Clifton glanced: 'ever the top of his&#xD;

&#xD;
paper at. her,' sometinws ,in irony, sometimes in 'sorrow,&#xD;
always in doubt., And sh~-.unpleasant as his manner was,&#xD;
felt glad to have him near her. I really believe that she had&#xD;
rather he 'sat there and made faces at her, than not sat there&#xD;
at all. And she felt lonesome and dreary when at:last he&#xD;
left the room, put on his riding-coat 'and left the house. As&#xD;
yesterday passed, so passed to-day--she meeting hin~ only at&#xD;
meals. And so a week' passed on. It i~ not easy to be&#xD;
very heroic for a day, or two, or~ three days; but when one&#xD;
day follows another, each with, the same 'continuous, e~tra-&#xD;
ordinary demand for fortitude, it is strange, indeed, if heart&#xD;
and flesh do not fail' under the task. Nothing but Divine&#xD;
Providence can give the requisite strength of endurance'. In&#xD;
the presence of h~r husband,,Catherine was calm and cheer-&#xD;
ful; 'but often in her private hours the sense of desolate be-&#xD;
reavement would come over her, and gusts of tears and sobs&#xD;
would ,follow. These, like the summer gusts of blessed na-&#xD;
ture, would always refresh her, and she would be enabled&#xD;
again to take tI~e comforting. promisess of the Bible to her&#xD;
heart, in her favorite text~-" And we know that all things&#xD;
work together for good,' to them that love. God," and to ask&#xD;
God's blessing again upon her~resolution "to perform ,every&#xD;
domestic and'every social duty as faithfully, W not as cheer-&#xD;
fully, as~ though, she were a 'happy wife," And yet it was&#xD;
very hard to do this. IL was very dreary to feel shut out&#xD;
from her husband's heart; to meet hin~~ every slay with the&#xD;
same stern, sorrowful brow,~ or in variation of that, with the&#xD;
same. ironical' smile. It was difficult to go on with a repulsed&#xD;
and aching heart, doing mere. mechanical duty., She could&#xD;
nothave done so but that two powerful principles sustained&#xD;
her..-an invincible love for her husband, and an unwavering&#xD;
faith in God.&#xD;
One~ morning, about two weeks after their arrival at home,&#xD;
Major Clifton si~t alone, reading, in. luis~tudy, when the door&#xD;
opened, and Catherine entered. It was ~ 'first '~i~e that&#xD;
she had intruded there,' and he looked up, tlgew aside his&#xD;
book, arose, and pushed back his chair with a look of anuoy~&#xD;
axice.&#xD;
"Excuse me for interrupting you, but may I speak to you&#xD;
for a few minutes ~"&#xD;
'~"Speak on;.madam, ~ut oblige me 'by being brief. ?ar-&#xD;

"Admirably' caleiilatedmadaii'! A contingency has pre-&#xD;
sented itself to your diplomatic wisdom, that never would&#xD;
have occurred to my simpler wind. So, you wish to confirm&#xD;
your position, and extend your connection here in the county!&#xD;
Well! the. aristocrats of R-, have certainly, taken you&#xD;
up with a zeal and determination that is surprising. But&#xD;
when they hav~e once wade up their haughty minds to patro-&#xD;

go. But yoa may thank your own fine diplomatic talents for&#xD;
'that !"&#xD;
"Diplomatic talents! What diplomatic talents'? So many&#xD;
people have 'thrust' that questionable 'greatness' upon me,&#xD;
that. it mortifies me.' No-I know the~ only' value 'and cur-&#xD;
rency I have among the 'county people, is' the value you have&#xD;
given me-the stamps of your name and rank. And I-I&#xD;
do not wish to disparage it. 1 wish to appear worthy of it-&#xD;
that is all."&#xD;
"And you really believe what you say'?"&#xD;

foi~ your sake, I would not alienate these peopfrby neglect."&#xD;

~ farther to say to~me ~&#xD;
No,'~said Catherine, and with anj~ivoluntary gesture of&#xD;
pain and distress, she turned and left. the room, with all her&#xD;
generous thoughts: unspoken. Wlieii' the door had closed&#xD;
behind her, ~Archer Clifton started. up~ struck, his clenched&#xD;
hands: to his forehead, and. pacing up and down the floor, dis-&#xD;
tractedly exclaimed-..&#xD;
"I love:her I love her! It is no us~, IL do Jove her!&#xD;
Every day more deeply and desperately I 'lov~ her ~., In her&#xD;

I could have implored her 'forgiveness for 'ever believing in&#xD;
that guilt which is but too well proved! Ilove her!, She is&#xD;
the pulse of my heart! the soul of my life! She embodies all&#xD;
the meaning of 'existence t~ rue! Heart and brain.-yes i-.&#xD;

heart! I muSt leave the house! must leave the neighbor-&#xD;
hood ! fo~ here I wilt and wither! And she! how cw~ she&#xD;
bear it? for I think, with all her falseness, she loves me very&#xD;
much. How catz shLe bear life so? . How, can she rise each&#xD;
morning and go thi'ough all the occupations of the day so&#xD;
regularly, quietly, cheerfully, day after day ?-omitting no&#xD;
duty, domestic or social, small or great, from the stitching&#xD;
my ripped gloves, to the keeping up of the county ~connec-&#xD;
tion, in sooth! While 1, I daily wilt, wither, in this moral&#xD;
mildew-idle, despairing, forgetting' all my obligations-for&#xD;
getting that my country needs my arm! .This cannot last!&#xD;
This must not be! I must get a*ay from here! I must raise&#xD;
a volunteer company, ftnd offer myself to the government, and&#xD;
in the tumult of the eampaigi fri forgetfulness or a grave!"&#xD;
Unable to compose himself again that mowing, he rand&#xD;
the bell, ordered his horse, seized his hat, went out, mounted,&#xD;
and ~rode away.&#xD;
The neit morning Catherine arose early, and among her&#xD;
orders for the day directed that the carriage should be at the&#xD;
door by ten o'clock. At th~ appointed hour~.she attired her-&#xD;
self with carc and taste, and went down into the front hall,&#xD;
where she found Major Clifton in readiness to attend her.&#xD;
They entered the carriage and set out, and in the course of a #&#xD;
drive of five or six hours' duration, made the circuit of the&#xD;
neighborhood, calling upon several families. And every-&#xD;
where Catherine. was received with distinguished respect.&#xD;
They reached home again about the ni&amp;amp;dle of the afternoon.&#xD;
The next few days passed on. in the usual dreary routine~.-&#xD;
except that Catherine knew Major ~Oliftoi~ was out riding&#xD;
every day and all day, and that he was in his study writing&#xD;
half the night. She did not knoW that this p~rte~ded until&#xD;
one morning he said to her--&#xD;
"Mrs. Clifton, you will oblige me b~ having my watdrobe&#xD;
prepared and packed at your earliest convenience. I have&#xD;
orders to join the - regiment within a week."&#xD;
Catherine turned very pale and reeled as if she would have&#xD;
fallen, but grasped the chair and steadied herself, till strength&#xD;
returned.&#xD;
"All shall be ready for you," she r~eplied.&#xD;
And he, with a cold bow of acknowledgment, went his way.&#xD;

fiivonte maid lenny, from the Hardbargam farm-house, was&#xD;
in attendance. lenny had cleared away the breakfast ~ser-&#xD;
vice, vith the reception of the ejiver plate,' which was 'col-&#xD;
lected upon a salver; and she stood by her mistress's chair&#xD;
waiting, in respectful sympathy; at last she said-.&#xD;
Miss Kate, honey, if you lend me the 'keys o' the plate&#xD;
closet, I can put away the things' safe, without your troublin&#xD;
o' yourself!" ' '&#xD;
Catherine lifted heriiead languidly, atid pushing away her&#xD;
drooping hair,' explained, quite 'unconsciously, and as if :the&#xD;
words burst of themselves fron~a her overbur~1eued bosom-.-'&#xD;
Oh! Henny, if. yoji knew how little heart I have to do&#xD;
anything !"&#xD;
"I does know it, mist'es~, deary; but 'you urns' jes take a&#xD;
fictionn on to it, honey, an'~ 'eider bow it ain't on'y niarster,&#xD;
but moe' in general all the geinmum in the neighborhood, as&#xD;
is gwine far the wars."&#xD;
Regretting tb~t ehe had permitted a complaint to escape&#xD;
her lips, yet ~atistied that her servant did not understand or&#xD;
suspect the' true cause of her sorrow, Catherine arose, and&#xD;
"Take up the salver and follow w~, lenny. Idle grief&#xD;
is very fruitless. If we cannot keep our friends with us, it&#xD;
is better to prep~re. for their Oouforta(bl~ living whije absent,&#xD;
t.ban to.~it dq~n in u~eiess sorrow."&#xD;
"An' that's the Lord's trufe, Miss Kate," said lenny,&#xD;
lifting the laden salver on her head, and settling it Mteadily,&#xD;
&#xD;
163&#xD;
&#xD;
"that s Marster blessed trufe! 'Sides which, II has a heap&#xD;

"'Deed he is, honey-~-gwine to ride body-servant long o'&#xD;

Miss Kate; don't look so '~oyed, honey; I won't use bad&#xD;
words again-'deed, 'fore my blessed, Hebbenly Marster&#xD;

ever since mother died, and the' 'turn he makes me for it,&#xD;
wanting' to go gallivauntin' off to the wars. in soldier's&#xD;

And with that lenny set down the salver and began to&#xD;
cry, while her mistress opened. the pl~ite closet.&#xD;
"Put them in, Henny, and I will s~e what can be done&#xD;
for you afterwards," said Catherine.&#xD;
Henny obeyed, and then said; as 'they left the room-&#xD;
"If you 'could 'snade MarAe Archy to leave poor Jack,&#xD;

"I will speak to Major Clifton in your heh~lf, flenny-.&#xD;
now go and ask Mrs. 'Mereer to come to me in my own&#xD;
chamber."       -&#xD;
AndOatherine passed on to her own apartment, and Henny&#xD;
went her errand. Very~ soon the housekeeper entered the&#xD;
chamber, ~and found Catherine busily engaged among linen,&#xD;
'stockings, ~~rayats,' and ether "beloDgings."&#xD;
"Iwant your as8i5tance, Mrs. Mercer, in preparing Major&#xD;

."My dear child, I am so sorry! But I have been waiting&#xD;
~for an: hour to speak to you. The truth is, I have just got&#xD;
a. letter'fr~nn my eon-in-law, who writes that~ my daugl~ter Is&#xD;
very; extremely low, with the bilious pleurisy, and wants me&#xD;
to Oonie right over, to L 'inunediately, without loss of&#xD;

"An4, certainly,,I could not refuse it, Mrs. Mercer.. I am&#xD;

"The weather is too cold, and the journey too arduous for&#xD;

Dandy to 'rut the horses to AJie carriage for you."&#xD;
A "The~earriage, dear honey, I shouldn'tt think of such a&#xD;

"No, I&#xD;
same troubled, preoccupied air that had marked her manner&#xD;
the whole morning. Mrs. Mercer soon after took leave&#xD;
and departed.'&#xD;
Au hour after this, Catherine heard Major Clifton enter&#xD;
the hall door and come up stairs. To her surprise, he paused&#xD;
before her chamber door and rapped. When she opened it,&#xD;
he said~~-&#xD;
"Will you favor me' *ith your company in my study for a&#xD;
few minutes, Mrs. Clifton ?"&#xD;
Catherine immediately laid down her work and followed&#xD;
him.&#xD;
When they reached the study, he set her a chair near&#xD;
the writing-table, and dropping in~to another, drew a port-&#xD;
folio 'before 'him, opened it, and turning out a number of'&#xD;
papers, saicF-&#xD;
"Mrs. Clifton, I told you, some weeks since, fhat at my&#xD;
departure, and during my indefinite absence, I should be'&#xD;
obliged to leave~ this estate under your charge ?"&#xD;
"Yes," answered Catherine attentively.&#xD;
"I am well aware that it"is'undoubtedly an onerous burden;&#xD;
and responsibility for one so young, butIwhen you feel it so,&#xD;
remember that you, yourself, courted the position, and must&#xD;
be content to take the toils 'with the honors, real or ima-&#xD;
ginary.&#xD;
Passing over his bitter jibe, Catherine said-&#xD;
"You need not doubt in leaving all to my care that all,&#xD;
will go: well. I am not twenty yet, it 'is trite, but IL have had&#xD;

He looked' al her countenance, at once noble' and meek in'&#xD;

Catherine bowed gently.&#xD;

This was a very unlucky proposition on Catherine's part.&#xD;
lie sat back in his ~hair, and looking at her in steady scorn;&#xD;
said-&#xD;
"Yes, madam, I have 'tested his skill and probity,' and&#xD;
know so well the degree of the former, and the quality of the&#xD;
latter, that I have already forbid him to set foot on my pre-&#xD;
inises or speak to my wife. 'Do you dare to think that I am&#xD;
your dupe, or his ~ And now, hear me:' In all the directions&#xD;
that I have given you, I have simply desired or requested&#xD;
you' to do this or that, bu~ in this matter of your perfidious&#xD;
brother Carl, I command you to hold no intercourse with him&#xD;
whatever."&#xD;
"You shall be obeyed," said Catherine, "you shall be&#xD;
obeyed," and she thought-" Your simplest wish, expressed&#xD;
to that effect, would have had all the power of this arbitrary&#xD;
command,"---but she did~not say it. She was never free of&#xD;
speech, least of all to him. 'And now he arose, as if to con-&#xD;
chide the interview. And she recollected her promise to&#xD;
lienny, to intercede for Jack, and' always more courageous&#xD;

said, loMug half her reserve.&#xD;

Catherine arose, trembling, and 'left the room;. one ago-&#xD;
nized complaint bursting from her tortured bosom-~-&#xD;
"Oh, IL would to Heaven this were over-some way!"&#xD;
He looked after her, with a countenance convulsed with&#xD;
sorrow, groaning-&#xD;
"sind so would I! And so would I to God that this&#xD;
were over-somehow! Oh !" he thought, rising again, and&#xD;
pacing the floor-" there is nothing in life so humiliating to&#xD;
an honorable-minded man, as to love and live with a perfl-~&#xD;
dious woman-to be daily tempted by his own heart and her&#xD;
blandish~nent, to become her dupe and his own scorn! To&#xD;
be hourly on ~he brink of clasping just so much proved&#xD;
treachery as her form conceals, to a half loving, half loath-&#xD;
ing bosom! , Serpents! Yes, I dreamed of a serpent, last&#xD;
night :-methouglit I was in the forests of Brazil, and the&#xD;
fatal cobra-di-capello had coiled itself around my neck, and&#xD;
raised its horrid head to mine, and I went to snatch the*&#xD;
deadly reptile' away, and ,found it to be only* Catherine's&#xD;
gentle arms and noble face. Deyils! Never~ did a demon&#xD;
'hide itself under a more deceptive form and face~!-with that&#xD;
saint-like bleiiding of nobility and meekness in her ~counte-&#xD;
nance. Every time she' talks with 'me, she brings.me to the&#xD;
very brink of abjuring my sincere convictions. IL must' get&#xD;
away from this place, or my mind will become unsettled, de-&#xD;
ranged. I nmust hasten my 'departure, and in the. meantime,&#xD;
she shall not talk with' me again.. She shall not cross the&#xD;
threshold of this room again, 'or if' she does, she shall meet&#xD;
with such a reception that she shall speedily retire."' And&#xD;
so, torn with passion, he walked .and raved, while Catherine&#xD;
sought her room, and threw herself. upon the bed, .gvng&#xD;
way to a burst of tears and sobs, and crying, in wild~rebel-&#xD;

"God! Oh, God! 'Infinite in power and love-do You&#xD;

for her imyatience~ she knelt, and humbled herself "under&#xD;

&#xD;
* Meeting Henny soon after, she told her to be consoled, for&#xD;
that she thought Jack would be let off,&#xD;
in the afternoon she received a pencilled note from Major&#xD;
Clifton,"announcing that lie should leave howe three days&#xD;
sooner than he had anticipated, namely, on the third day&#xD;
from that date~, Leaning. against the, projecting chimney..&#xD;
piece, she held the note, stupidly gazing at it.' J3ut two&#xD;
days were left 'before he should depart then-.she thought.......&#xD;
and he was ~going, really going upon a long and perilous miii'&#xD;
4ary, service, tind pal'ting with her in deep, unmitigated anger,&#xD;
under the seemingly ineffaceable impression of her utter un-&#xD;
worthiness-believing her to be guilty of-.-what? ay! what ~&#xD;
for up to this moment she had not the slighest idea of his&#xD;
i'eason for condemning her. And now she blamed herself&#xD;
for cowardice, in having hesitated to entreat him ito inform&#xD;
her of what fault ~o~' crime she was suspected, and to give&#xD;
her the opportunity of exculpating herself. And she re-&#xD;
proached herself 'for that failing of 'the heart, and falling of&#xD;
the eyes, and faltering of the voice~ that wade her so power-&#xD;
less, and placed her at such a disadvantage in his presence.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, indeed;" she said, "I know my manner is enough&#xD;
to eonVict n~e; I do not wonder at nor blame him for think-&#xD;
ing~ ill of me, so long as my eyes sink beneath his look.&#xD;
J~ut how, can I help it. It must be so while he frowns or&#xD;
sneers. One encouraging word or glance from him, and I&#xD;
could look up and speak." And next she remembered how&#xD;
much he 'must Buffer in~ continuing to think her unworthy,&#xD;
and in departing under that impressio~i-~.-and at this thought,&#xD;
all that was 'most generous and benevolent, in her nature&#xD;
aroee to inspire her with ~urage, and she resolved to go to&#xD;
him, and, though heart 'and frame should tremble to meet&#xD;
that dread look of stern sorrow Qi" piercing.scorn.......to perse-&#xD;
verb in imploring him to tell her with what crime she stood&#xD;
charged.&#xD;
* J~ut though she 'had determined 'upon this act, it was&#xD;
eztreniely difficult to perform it. All the afternoon, and&#xD;
evening he came and went in suoh hurry, and seemed so&#xD;
entrenched behind his own private thoughts tind purposes,&#xD;
that she feared to break: in' upon his reserve. Once indeed,&#xD;
for the purpose of speaking to him upon the subject, she&#xD;
entered his study, and stood by the table; but he turned&#xD;
ground, 4rew himself upsat back in his chair, an&amp;amp; looked&#xD;
upon her with such sarcastic arrogance, that, abashed and&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
12&#xD;
&#xD;
'confounded, without opening her lips she turned and left the&#xD;
'room.&#xD;
And so the aftei'noon and evening passed, and the next&#xD;
day, the last of his stayarrived. All day Catherine sought&#xD;
an opportunity of speaking with 'him alone. In vain! 'He&#xD;
was resolved to afford her none. He sedukrnsly avoided her.&#xD;
As a last resort she wrote a note, requesting an interview,&#xD;
and sent it to 'him. She received an ~nswer stating that his&#xD;
time for the day was all pre-engaged. And so this last day&#xD;
also passed. That night she completed her part in the pre-&#xD;
parations for his departure, and retired late to a sleepless&#xD;
bed. She heard him come in very late, and enter his room,&#xD;
which joined her own.&#xD;
At early dawn she arose and koked at the time-piece on&#xD;
her chamber mantle-shelf. It was but' five o'clock. lie&#xD;
was not 'to leave till ten. There were five precious ~bours&#xD;
left yet. And oh!' how inestimably 'precious, if in them she&#xD;
~could effect a reconciliation with her. husband. They were&#xD;
like the last hours of a dying one, with salvation, staked upon&#xD;
'them. She felt that' the crisis had come, that she must not&#xD;
falter now. She knelt and prayed for strength and courage,&#xD;
as we only pray a few times in life-with that impassioned&#xD;
'earnestnesS of supplication that ever~ brings an angel down&#xD;
"strengthening" us. Then, encouraged, she arose, completed&#xD;
her simple toilet, and went down stairs to her morning duties.&#xD;
The breakfast hour was seven. And oh, she watched the&#xD;
'clock as she, unjustly condemned to death, might watch in&#xD;
the last fleeting hours preceding execution-hoping, still&#xD;
hoping for some saving revelation. A little while after seven&#xD;
he came down stairs, entered the breakfast-room, and bowing&#xD;
with his usual cold greeting of-&#xD;
"'Good-morning, madam," sat doWn.&#xD;
She rang for the coffee, and then took her place at the&#xD;
head of the tahle~.&#xD;
He went through with the morning meal, with his cus-&#xD;
'tomary, reflective leisure. And' Catherine watched the hand&#xD;
of the clock, as it traveled on towayds 'eight. She was sick&#xD;
with apprehension. 'She could not speak to him there, for&#xD;
the servants were in attendance. At last he 'arose, left the&#xD;
table, and went out to give some final directions ~concerning&#xD;
his baggage, and the hor~s anA servants he was totake with&#xD;
'him. And then' he went up stairs and entered his study. It&#xD;
was just eight o'clock, and ~he had two invaluable hours left&#xD;

yet. As if life, and death hung upon their issue, she resolved,&#xD;
come what might, to use them in a final effort for a recon-&#xD;
;ciliation. Pale and trembling in every limb,' she left the&#xD;
table, and went up stairs, slowly, holding by the balustrades&#xD;
from weakness. When she reached the study-door she found&#xD;
it ajar, and through it, she saw him sitting at his writing-&#xD;
table-not busy, as'she had feared and expected to find him,&#xD;
but doing~ absolutely nothing-with his elbows resting on the&#xD;
table, and his faceburied in the palms of his hands-.-in the&#xD;
attitude and expression of the deepest sorrow and despair.&#xD;
That one glunpse. of his suffering face, sufficed 'to drive every&#xD;
fear but that of anxion~ affection from her heart-.." It is be-&#xD;
cause he thinks me unworthy. I must not 'leave him to think&#xD;
so longer. ,Be strong, coward heart," she said, to herself,&#xD;
and then she went in and stood beside his chair, resting her&#xD;
hand, for support, upon the table, trembling with nervous&#xD;
weakness, and blushing with the bashfulness she could not&#xD;
but, feel in making this advance, anj altogether, in his sus-&#xD;
picious eyes, looking very much like a conscious culprit. She&#xD;
stood, unable to utter one word, until he lifted up his head,&#xD;
and seeing her, demanded coldly-.-&#xD;
"'What is your, pleasure, Mrs. Clifton ?"&#xD;
She attempted to speak, but a mute sob was all that&#xD;
ensued.&#xD;
With a piercing sarcasm, ho asked-&#xD;
"Can I serve you in any manner this morning, madam ?"&#xD;
With a gesture of deprecation and entreaty, she an-&#xD;
swered-.&#xD;
"Yes! *yes! I wish to be put upon my trial! Archer!-&#xD;
Major Clifton! you withdrew your favor from ~&amp;amp;so suddenly!&#xD;
You never told me why! Oh! tell we, before you go, how&#xD;
I have been so wretched as to ,lose your esteem-and put&#xD;
me upon my defence."&#xD;
He frowned, darkly, as with both pain and&#xD;
plied-.                        '        anger, and re~.&#xD;
"I have. had occasion twice' before to remind you, Mrs.&#xD;

'exclaiming-.-&#xD;
"Why? Oh! 'why V You wer&amp;amp; alwaysjust.. You never&#xD;

than just. Will you 'condemn me untried, unjudged, un.i~&#xD;

"It is quite sufficient to me, madam," he answered;&#xD;
haughtily, "that the, proofs of your turpitude are conclusive&#xD;
to my oWn mjnd."&#xD;
"I know it," she said, meekly, "I know it.-yet, pause-&#xD;
what would you think of th&amp;amp; justice oe a' judge, who should&#xD;
say to one suspected of crime-' Your guilt is so clear, that&#xD;
it is useless to charge you with it, or to hear the testimony,&#xD;
or to listen to what you might have to say in your defence,'&#xD;
and so proceed to condemn him? Such things were never,&#xD;
surely, done, in the darkest ages, or under the most despotic&#xD;
rulers. And is that guilt, of which I am suspected, of so,&#xD;
heinous a character as to preclude me from the~ privilege ex.-&#xD;
'tended even to criminals-the privilege of a trial ?" She&#xD;
paused-but he continued to regard her with a stern, set face,&#xD;
without replying. Drooping over the table, and leaning&#xD;
heavily upou it, she spoke again, and her voice fell in low,&#xD;
but clear, ~nelodious tones, as she said-" God and man,'&#xD;
and I, myself, have made you my judge, and the arbiter of&#xD;
my destiny here. It is an awful power. You have made me&#xD;
feel it to be such. It is an awful power, because it is a sub..&#xD;

any law. I have no appeal from it-noi&amp;amp; Nor-please to&#xD;

my life by appealing from your judgment to another tribunal.&#xD;

"Catherine," he answered, in a softened yoice..-~~C you are&#xD;
not condemned; if you were~you would not be standing here&#xD;
at my side."&#xD;
"~Vhat do you mean? good Heaven !"&#xD;
"Tins," he replied with a sudden~ change of manner, as&#xD;
though angry with himself for his transient relenting. "This!&#xD;
'that oftentimes it happens that the only mercy we can show&#xD;
the guilty, is not to bring them to trial! To openly recog-&#xD;
nize guilt, i~. to be obliged to punish it. If we ~listinitly&#xD;
'accuse', weare bound to prove, and if we prove, to condemn&#xD;
and sentence."&#xD;
"And is iii~y ease such a one ?"&#xD;
"Your case is such a one."&#xD;
"Yet still I beg to be tried! For if not to try them is&#xD;
often the only way to save the~ guilty, to~' tTy them is&#xD;
oftener the only way' to cleai~ the innocent. Accuse me-~.-.&#xD;
hear my defence, and be yourself my* judge. I ask no&#xD;
other."&#xD;
"Of what avail were)t to rehearse your acts' of falsehood&#xD;
and treachery. You know them this 'moment even better&#xD;
than I' do."&#xD;
~' Falsehood and treachery-just Heaven!"&#xD;
* "Yes, madam, t~iose' were the words [ used."&#xD;
"You are mistaken in attributing such wickedness to me;&#xD;
but tell me 'the grounds of your suspicions; doubtless I can&#xD;
explain them, and clear myself."&#xD;
He laughed ~ scornful, sardonic' lau~h, and replied, "Oh,&#xD;
doubtless a woman.of your' diplomatic genius is fertile in ex-&#xD;
planations. Whether you could by possibility clear yQurself,&#xD;
'is another question; for I speak-not of suspicions but of&#xD;
'positive knowledge."&#xD;
His strong conviction of her turpitude infected' her with&#xD;
despair at last. She said, very mournfully-&#xD;
"Itknow that it has sometimes happened that the innocent&#xD;
have been tried and convicted-overwhelni~d by' a mass of&#xD;
circumstantial evidenoe~-~and that may' be my case; never-&#xD;
theless, even they have had the poor satisfaction of knowing&#xD;
for what they suffered. Tell me, I 'beseech you. Twill still&#xD;
'hope that I can acquit 'myself. Not for my own sake,&#xD;
*Ai~cher, dear Archer~-~but for yours; ~it must be so agonizing&#xD;
to be ~forced to think ill of~ one we have loved as you once&#xD;
loved me. I suffer very much in' the loss of your esteem;&#xD;
but were it possible for our cases to be ~reversed-were I&#xD;
&#xD;
forced 'to think evil of you, I do not know, indeed I do not&#xD;
know how I could go on with daily life at all !'~&#xD;
"I think you had better cease discoursing and retire;&#xD;
your diplomatic talent is not 'in high action this morning; you&#xD;
permit your words to betray you."&#xD;
"To betray me !"&#xD;
"Yes, madam,; for if you felt yoi~irseJf to be innocent,&#xD;
would you not necessarily think very ill of me for treating&#xD;
you as a guilty woman ~"&#xD;
"No! no! I know that to have condemned me so&#xD;
promptly, so unequivocally, 'you must have, what you think,&#xD;
proof positive against me. 'Rut produce it! 'I am innocent;&#xD;
indeed I am, Archer. I believe in Heaven's justice. I be-&#xD;
lieve that if I call on the Lord, He will sooner or later; in I~[is&#xD;
own good time, enable me to prove it."&#xD;
"I will, produce 'the ~estimony," ~he said, going to an&#xD;
escritoir, opening it and ~king from' it a note in a gray en-&#xD;
velope. Returning to his seat, he laid it before her, asking&#xD;
"Is this your handwriting ?"&#xD;
Catherine glanced at it-it was the envelope she had&#xD;
directed to Mrs.' Georgia Clifton, and she' immediately&#xD;
answered-.&#xD;
"Yes, certainly it is."&#xD;
"Ah it is; when was it written ?"&#xD;
"The last day of your dear mother's life. Ah! now I re.~&#xD;
member, it was from that day you' took your favor from me."&#xD;
"Yes, madam," he said, withdrawing the fatal ~note from&#xD;
the envelope, and laying it before her, adding, "Do you ac-&#xD;
knowledge this as' your writing' also?" ' ' -&#xD;
Catherine looked at the note without heeding 'the words,&#xD;
and raising her' innocent eyes with wonder to his face, ant.&#xD;
swered, without an instant's hesita~tion~-.&#xD;
"Yes, assuredly, that is mine !"&#xD;
Her perfect unconsciousness should have convinced him of&#xD;
her inn6cenoe-would have done 'so perhaps, but' that, pre-&#xD;
judiced against her, he took her manner to be super-refined&#xD;
art; and determined toforce her to the point, he said-&#xD;
"Would you ~wOar it ?"&#xD;
Catherine took 'np the letter and examined it.&#xD;
"Ay! read it, read. it."&#xD;
Catherine read the note, turned deadly pale, fell 'back in&#xD;
her chair, and let' the paper drop from her hands-over-&#xD;
whelmed by the enormous wickedness of the forgery. Scarcely&#xD;

&#xD;
restraining a bitter curse, he picked up the fatal note, pushed.&#xD;
the door open with his foot, crossed the hall, and entered his&#xD;
bed-chamber, 'banging the door a~er him.&#xD;
One stunned moment she sat t~ius, then started to her feet,&#xD;
bewildered, distracted, and with ~ wild -impulse, fled across&#xD;
the hall and into his chamber, and sank at his feet speech-&#xD;
less, mute, but catching his hand, and clinging to it. When&#xD;
she ~struggled and recovered her voice, she exclaimed,&#xD;
simply-&#xD;
"I' did~not write that letter, Archer. I did not write that&#xD;
letter."&#xD;
He twisted his hand rudely out of her grasp, and turned&#xD;
away, yvithout reply.&#xD;
She clasped her hands earnestly, exclaiming again.-.&#xD;
".1 did not write that letter! It is impossible I ever&#xD;
should have conceived, much less ye written such. a letter!&#xD;
I do. not know who wrote it. I "!iover laid my eyes on it&#xD;
before!"&#xD;
An incredulous, insulting smile, wa~ his reply.&#xD;
"Oh! what shall I say to convince you? Indeed, indeed&#xD;
I did not do it!"&#xD;
"Come, perjure yourself! Swear it."&#xD;
She was silent.&#xD;
"I ask you to swear it."&#xD;
She was still silent.&#xD;
"Come, now-.will you declare upon oath that you did not&#xD;
write that letter ?"&#xD;
"God sees me! I did not!"&#xD;
"That's no oath ! Here's the New Testament, swear upon&#xD;
the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God that you didn't write&#xD;
it~ and, perhaps, I will believe you, for well I know that many&#xD;
unprincipled people have a sort of fearful respect for an oath,&#xD;
which in them is not piety,'but superstition. I think you just&#xD;
such a one! Come, now, swear that you did not write it !"&#xD;
He ' paused' for an. answer, but she looked at him in great&#xD;
trouble.' "Will you do it?"&#xD;
"'Major Clifton, I cannot !"&#xD;
"Not swear that you did not write it ?"&#xD;
"No, sir."&#xD;
"Then that only confirms and seals the truth of what I&#xD;
knew before, that, of course, you did write it."&#xD;
She wrung her hands in deep distress, and said-&#xD;
"I cannot swear, Archer. I mean I dare not swear,&#xD;
&#xD;
Archer, even to prove my innocence, and get back your&#xD;
love.''&#xD;
"And why, pray ~" lie asked, with a mocking smile.&#xD;
"Oh, Archer! my Lord and yours has commanded us to&#xD;
Swear not at all.' I dare not break that command."&#xD;
"Tush, girl, you are clumsy. Do you' presume to think&#xD;
I can be duped by that afl'ectation.of super-righteousness ?"&#xD;
"Oh, Heaven! Oh, Heaven! what shall I do 'P' said Ca-&#xD;
therine, in despair.&#xD;
"Swear, and I will believe, you," he answered, mockingly.&#xD;
"Oh! why will not my simple word do? Oh! do you&#xD;
think I would tell a falsehood even to save my life ?"&#xD;
"Do I? Doea not an 'astute diplomatist, like you, know&#xD;
that I know a woman who can be false,, treacherous, hypo-&#xD;
critical ;-who, so young, can plot so well, and succeed so&#xD;
entirely ;-can also tell a falsehood to conceal her baseness ?"&#xD;
he answered, looking down upon her in insufferable scorn.&#xD;
Then her whole manner changed. She arose to her feet&#xD;
with a certain calm and gentle dignity, and pushing back the&#xD;
veiling tresses from her noble brow, answered nobly-..&#xD;
"Yes, it is true! If I could have conceived such trea.&#xD;
chery, and written ~iich~a letter as that, I could 'also have&#xD;
lied to conceal it! There is only one* on earth that knows&#xD;
my innocence, the writer of that letter. But one. in Heaven&#xD;
knows it, and He will make it manifest. I believe in mira-&#xD;
cles, because I heli~ve in* the infinite' power and goodness of&#xD;
God, and in the everlasting promises of the Bible."&#xD;
"Well done, Maria Teresa! r&amp;amp;dly that is the best of all!&#xD;
In~ked, your talents are quite lost upon such unworthy game&#xD;
as me and my poor estate-good-bye !" , And laughing bit-&#xD;
terly, he left the room, and hurried~down stairs. .A few&#xD;
minutes after she heard the clock strike ten-then she arose&#xD;
and .went .to the window to look out. . lije stood upon' the&#xD;
lawn, in riding geai', near a group ionsistjng of his' servant&#xD;
Dandy, and three saddle-horses. She saw him vault into his&#xD;
saddle, and ride away, attended by' Dandy, mounted on one&#xD;
horse and leading another. As he 'passed the outer gate,&#xD;
one look of love, sorrow, and despair, he turned towards her&#xD;
window, and then vanished into the forest road.&#xD;
She did not see that look-she could not have seen it at&#xD;
that distance; she saw that he was gone, and turning from&#xD;
the window, she sank down upon the carpet in the collapse&#xD;
of deepest sorrow.&#xD;

Gone! He was gone! His presence ~that had made all&#xD;
suffering tolerable was withdrawn, and the place was empty~&#xD;
life itself was. empty.&#xD;
He wa~ gone-gone-not lovingly, after a lingering, ten-&#xD;
der leave-taking-that would have been sorrowful enough;&#xD;
but -it Would have been cheered by the promise of frequent&#xD;
interchange of letters, and the anticipation of re-union; how&#xD;
much more sorrowful this utter separation!&#xD;
Gone! gQne! not in anger- that would have been bitter&#xD;
indeed; but it would have been sweetened by hope that au-&#xD;
ger would subside, that reflection would come, and reconcilia-&#xD;
tion ensue; but how much bitterer this bopele~s disunion.&#xD;
Gone in scorn! Gone in loathing! Gone to return no&#xD;
more but as a stranger! Oh, insupporta1~le grief! Oh, hope-&#xD;
less anguish! Oh, despair!&#xD;
A few short weeks ago the heaven &amp;amp;f her life had been so&#xD;
serene, so divinely serene, and her soul had reflected back&#xD;
the beautiful" great calm," as a still lake the clear sky.&#xD;
Now all was changed! Now all was clouds and storm and&#xD;
darkness! A -howling wilderness around! A howling tern-&#xD;
pest overhead! An~l her soul answered. bach the tempestuous&#xD;
discord of life, a~ the storm-tossed ocean, the storm-lowered&#xD;
sky! All was confusion, distraction, chaos!&#xD;
Wild impulses-suggestions of the fiend-darted meteor..&#xD;
like athwart her mind :-to fly-to go away and leave a&#xD;
place, where she had been brought a bride, full of love and&#xD;
hope and trust, and where every feeling of womanly pride&#xD;
and delicacy had been ruthlessly, insultingly trampled in the&#xD;
dust! /&#xD;
But simultaneously with this suggestion, arose the instinct&#xD;
of the wife, and the inspiration of the Christian, teaching her&#xD;
that scorned and outraged as she had ~boen, her only p~ost of&#xD;
duty as of hope, was her husband's home. Yes, aiiiid all the&#xD;
gloom and terror, she caught this one glimpse of Heaven.&#xD;
Amid all .the clash and clang of passion and de,~pair, she&#xD;
heard this voice of God.&#xD;

And perpexed ?~er night and morn,&#xD;
With the burden of a station&#xD;
Unto which she was not born.-TENNYsoN.&#xD;
SLOWLY, very slowly Catherine recovered from the shock&#xD;
of that bitter parting. And then she felt so lonely-so deso-&#xD;
late; no mother-no sister-'---no bosom friend, to give her&#xD;
one comforting look of sympathy, or one sustaining word of&#xD;
affection. And. she mourned afresh the loss of that dear,&#xD;
sympathizing, toaternal friend, always so ready- in her loving&#xD;
wisdom, always so ready in any trial or affii~tion to give&#xD;
counsel and 4~o1nfoi't. And, oh! Catherine needed these-p--&#xD;
for, like the black, scudding fragments of clouds left by the&#xD;
tempest, dark, despairing-thoughts drifted t~rougli her-mind.&#xD;
Yes, she had need, and profoundly felt that need, of counsel&#xD;
and comfort in this bewildering sorrow; but of whom could&#xD;
she seek it ~ Of none-of none must she seek it. The true&#xD;
wife's instinct taught her that. For even when the retrospec-&#xD;
tive image of his dead~ mother, her ow~ beloved bosom friend,&#xD;
recurred in the shape of a ouce possible ~niediator between&#xD;
herself and husband, her mind intuitiveLy~ recoiled from the&#xD;
idea, and she knew that were that dear mother - now living,&#xD;
not even of her could she make a confidant-that the reli-&#xD;
gious unity, the integral sanctity, the cherished exclusiveness&#xD;
of marriage would be. invaded and broken, and the sweet&#xD;
~harm lost by the introduction of a third party-.--beloved~even&#xD;
as that dear, mutual -mother-into its sacred counsels. No,&#xD;
unhappy and bewildered as -she wits, she felt that by all her&#xD;
hopes of &amp;amp; future happy union, th~s wretched division must&#xD;
be kept to herself-upon herself solely recoil the burden and&#xD;
the pain-she "must tread the wine- press alone." And&#xD;

&#xD;
even when she prayed for Divine inspiration to guide her, the&#xD;
response came from the depths of her spirit, "The Word of&#xD;
God is within you."&#xD;
And how empty the house ~eemed because one was away-&#xD;
how gloomy-how funereal-even the light footstep of a&#xD;
chamber-maid in the distance sounded hollowly,-sending a&#xD;
dreary echo through. the many passages of the great, empty&#xD;
house-empty, for ~th&amp;amp;t he was gone.&#xD;
It seemed not worth while to go on with daily life at all-.&#xD;
to keep up the fire on the household hearth, or to light the&#xD;
evening lamp, or to order meals for herself alone.&#xD;
But if Catherine were for once tempted ir~ her sorrow to&#xD;
forget her duties,-her duties were not the least disposed to&#xD;
leave her long in peace-no, not for an hour.&#xD;
Catherine was roused from' her fit of deep thought by the&#xD;
entrance of a field woman, who, with the usual curtsey, and&#xD;
the customary greeting of-" Sarvunt, ma'am," stood before&#xD;
raised her~ heavy eyelids abstractedly.&#xD;
'~ Sarvunt, ma'am," said the woman, again ourtseying,&#xD;
"Aunt Field Mary is well over 'it, ma'am. It's a boy"chile,&#xD;
zna'axn; a likelyy little boy~chile as ever you. see, .~ma'am.&#xD;
'Au' Aunt Field Mary told me to tell you, ma'am, how, thank&#xD;

ma'am. ~'                              -&#xD;
"What--what did you say i". asked Catherine, passing&#xD;
her hand. over her forehead, to dispel the concentration of&#xD;
sorrowful .th~iught.&#xD;
'~ Aunt~'ield Mary, ina'am, it's a boy-chile, xna'am, a likely&#xD;

have a holyday to-day, ma'am,, an' stay home out'n de field,&#xD;
seem' how it's 'his firstest son an' bier oiit'n seven darters."&#xD;
Passing her hand across her forehead slowly, Catherine&#xD;
dispersed the la~t lingering fragments of her bitter reverie,&#xD;
and stood upto her simple, practical, household duties. And&#xD;
&#xD;
then her action was clet~r and decided. She took up her&#xD;
little basket of keys, bade the woman follow her, and went&#xD;
lown stairs and into the pantry, where she ~lled a hamper&#xD;
with tea and sugar, crackers, jelly, and other little matters,&#xD;
and gave it to her attendant, saying-&#xD;

* "Nelly, there is one thing that I must say to you now,&#xD;
and which I wish you to remember. It is that when I give&#xD;
a direction' I intend it to be followed."&#xD;
The old woman looked mortified, and. took up the hamper,&#xD;
settled it upon her head, and went out. It pained Cathe-&#xD;
rine~s~ gentle heart to speak so peremptorily. Jut this was&#xD;
one among the abuses she felt it to be her imperative duty to&#xD;
reform, the habits of idleness and listlessness, and the pro.&#xD;
density to stand and' gossip among the domestics. Trifling&#xD;
as this little incident was, it served to arouse Catherine and&#xD;
place her on her feet, aild she did not utterly sink again.&#xD;
:'The evening fire wa~ kindled on the household hearth, and&#xD;
the evening, lamp lighted, though there was but one lonely&#xD;
woman to feel their cheering influence.&#xD;
The next day was theSabbath, and Catherine as usual&#xD;
attended church. She felt deeply the need of religious'con-&#xD;
solation., Her spirit hungered, thirsted, failed and fainted&#xD;
for the ~eeding~ refreshing, strengthening mipistrations of 'the&#xD;
gospel. ~Uhe old, sad, unanswered problem' of unmerited&#xD;
suffering~ perpl~zed her. She felt herself sinking into that&#xD;
sad and nearly hopeless state of mind, induced by great and&#xD;
singular trials' to' be borne perforce alone and in secret-&#xD;
when, wanting human sympathy and failing of. divine com-&#xD;
foa4, the soul loses, sight of the Merciful Father in the Om-&#xD;
nipotent Creator, or in other words, of especial Proyidence&#xD;
in general Providence, and falls sadly, despairingly back&#xD;
upon its helpless self, and says that the Supreme Ruler of&#xD;
the Universe, the Governor of countless millions of suns and&#xD;
systems, never stoops to care for a poor, lost atom like itself.&#xD;
She r~eede&amp;amp;t6 hear the gospel message of love and hope&#xD;
again~ ~~;B~it~when' shd entered her pew, and ~raised her eyes&#xD;

to the 'pulpit, she was disappointed in missing from his place&#xD;
the mild and' venerable face and form of the parish clergy-&#xD;
man, whose teachings every Sabbath morning sent her home&#xD;
with renewed love, and sustained her through the week,~ and&#xD;
she was pained to see in his stead a young wan, a inere&#xD;
youth in seeming, some student newly ordained, she sup-&#xD;
posed, and she sank back in her seat, saddened with the&#xD;
thought that she would not get the greatly needed spiritual&#xD;
help from him; for what ~uld a student in his youth kilow&#xD;
of life's dread trials ~ of the heart's mournful experiences,&#xD;
or the spirit's deep needs ~ She felt sure he could not help&#xD;
her, and she sank back; resigning herself with a deep sigh.&#xD;
The opening hymn was given out-&#xD;
God moves in a mysterious way&#xD;
His wonders to perform,&#xD;
He plants His footsteps on the sea,&#xD;
And rides upon the storm.&#xD;
Ye rearf'uI souls, fresh Courage take,&#xD;
The cloud ye so much dread.&#xD;
Is big with mercy, and shall break&#xD;
In blessings oa yottr head.&#xD;
The' first words of this hymn fell upon Catherine's sni'..&#xD;
praised ear, filling her soul with awe-.f'or it seemed a direct&#xD;
answer to her thought. And all that hymn, evei~y stanza,&#xD;
every line, was filled with meaning for her, and powerful in&#xD;
its effect upon her mind, in its peculiar state of experience.&#xD;
She listened in penitent, grateful, reverent silence, folding&#xD;
her hands meekly, and saying within her heart-.&#xD;
"Father, forgive my doubts and fears! 'I will believe it!&#xD;
Yes, I will believe that even this heavy cloud is laden with&#xD;
mercy, and will shower blessings! I~~wil1 believe that even&#xD;
thjs bitter trial--this bitter, bitter separation and disunion,&#xD;
is in some way necessary to our morah~gr6wth and future&#xD;
welfare, and that J shall see it! I do believe it, for I have&#xD;
had blessed answers before to doubts. 'And we know that&#xD;
all things work together for good to them that love the&#xD;
Lord.' 'I do believe it."&#xD;
God is His own interpreter,&#xD;
~And He will make it plain,&#xD;
were the solemn last words of the, Divine Song that awed her&#xD;
into stillnes~. This hymn was suns, Catherine's beautiful&#xD;
voice joining the choir. And when it was ended, followed&#xD;

&#xD;
the prayer, so singularly coincident, that every' word gave&#xD;
voice to the deep silent cry in her own suffering heart.&#xD;
And then the young minister arose to give out the text:&#xD;
Matthew x. 29. "Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing?&#xD;
And~ one of them shall not fall on the ground without your&#xD;
Father." And here followe~l the sermon.' The manner of&#xD;
the young preacher was~ modest, natural, calm and sweet, as&#xD;
befitted the gentle words of the text, and the consoling sub..&#xD;
ject of 'the sermo~i-FArrn ~IN' PUovxDENcE~-.the childlike&#xD;
faith that comes through the heart, and not through the&#xD;
head. Catherine ha4 thought he could not help her. Never&#xD;
had she been more in. error ~in her life. That pale young&#xD;
preacher had a divine message for her-.-for ker; an answer&#xD;
to her unsolvable problem; a message, providentially, the&#xD;
most direct, pointed, strong, startling that ever fell from&#xD;
lips touched with fire, revivifying the soul of the receiver ;' a&#xD;
ne~sage that satisfied every doubt, and calmed every fear,&#xD;
and replied to every question as perfectly, as satisfyingly, as&#xD;
if Heaven had spoken; a message that aroused faith, revived&#xD;
hope, rekindled love, till all the soul glowed with divine fire.&#xD;
She was wrapped, entranced, carried away by the eloquence,&#xD;
power and pathos of this divinely-inspired discourse.. She&#xD;
never ~jaw the young preacher before ~or after, b~mt line had&#xD;
dropped a celestial treasure deep into where she kept it&#xD;
safe-a talisman through all the trial of life.&#xD;
She left the church loving, hopefuJ, strong in faith, strong&#xD;
to act and endure, patient to wait. So elevated and inspired&#xD;
was her soul, that it illumined her whole countenance~ And&#xD;
when th~ county ladies crowded around her at the church&#xD;
door to condole with her on the departure of Major Clifton,&#xD;
and to press hospitalities upon her, and to urge her not to&#xD;
mope in widowhood at home, their benevolent purposes were&#xD;
forgotten in their surprise, and the first words were-&#xD;
"Why, how brightly you look this morning, Mrs. Clif~&#xD;
ton!"&#xD;
Catherine promised many visit~, and e~ten~ed many inyi-&#xD;
tations, ~nd finally was glad to escape and enter her carriage,&#xD;
to dwell in lonely, loving reverence upon the words she had&#xD;
heard. And she reached home. And the Word departed&#xD;
not from her, neither that day, nor the next~ nor through life.&#xD;
And with the perfect faith in God, perfect trust in her future&#xD;
came. And ag~dn she whispered to herself the' charming&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE CURSE 01' OLIFT0N~            18~&#xD;
"I will w~dt patiently-I will work faithfully. The post&#xD;
of. duty, as of hope;' is my husband's house and home. He&#xD;
trusts me, at least, even now, with the' charge of this great&#xD;
plantation. Construe it as he may, it is a mark of great'&#xD;
confidence.' I will be true to the trust."&#xD;
And then, indeed, as she whispered these words to' her&#xD;
heart, hope, sweet hope, inspired her more and more, and&#xD;
strengthened her 'more and more, and she felt that he still&#xD;
loved her-she felt it by that 'sure instinct that teaches a&#xD;
woman when she' is beloved, though no'word, look, or 'ges-&#xD;
ture reveals it to her. And she acted upon 'this feeling,&#xD;
although almost unconscious of its 'existence as 'a motive.&#xD;
And she knew that she would be useful to 'him~ substantially&#xD;
useful to him where she wags--for wth her it was not enough&#xD;
to be devoted, s~u1 and body,~o his interests,-..no, "wishing&#xD;
well" must have a'~ body in' it,"~ in order "to be' felt." She&#xD;
communed ~ith her heart, asking-..-&#xD;
"What, besides the service of God, do' I really live for in.&#xD;
this world? For his happiness. Yes, 'my profound heart,&#xD;
that is it! For his good, his interests, his welfare~ I' 'have&#xD;
not been an obstacle t6 his 'happiness. 'I have not 'been a&#xD;
stumbling block in the ,~ay of' his' marrying anoLher~' No !&#xD;
for I fe~l that he loves'me: at he never loved ~n~6ther; and I&#xD;
love ~hini as he ~vat never .loved by another'; 'and~has' any&#xD;
other- the instinct, the inspiration, the strength and patience'&#xD;
to bear with him, that God has placed in my' beart? I will&#xD;
believe and 'trust in the Lord and His inspirations. And&#xD;
heart, 'and brain, and hands,-all that 17 am, and all that I&#xD;
have, will I devqteto hisservice. And until he restores me,&#xD;
that alone '~hali~nake my occupation and my happiness. "&#xD;
The next morning being Monday, she arose with the inten-~&#xD;
tion of taking seriously in ha~nd the 'business of' the estate.&#xD;
This was now the first of December, and.~:.there was a great&#xD;
deal 'to' be done before the close of the year; in financial, as&#xD;
well as in domestic 'and agricultural matters. The overseer&#xD;
and 'tli~ "hfred farhdaborers 'had all been paid in advance, up&#xD;
to' the' first 'of January.. And Major Clifton had 'left Cathe-&#xD;
rine twelVe 'hundred dQllars in cash, for her own etirrent ex-'&#xD;
ponses. ~All' this' money 'she had aV once determined to&#xD;
devote to another purp9sc-nam~ly-----to lifting sOme of those&#xD;
notes which wduld fall due on the first of the year. She de~&#xD;
termined, als9,. iii, ~r4er to help 'to clear off the 'incubus of~&#xD;
debt for the coming year, to try to find 'a tenant for Hardbar-&#xD;

&#xD;
gain, and to devote the rent to the takingup of the remaining&#xD;
notes. She went into a patient and thorough examination&#xD;
of the overseer's accounts, and discovered, with much pain,&#xD;
That Jie bad embezzled the funds trusted to him for the pay-&#xD;
)nent of the hired hands; and a stricter review of his con-&#xD;
duct, rcsu1~d in the detection of other malpractices, that&#xD;
decide a erine to give him warning. A very little ob~&#xD;
servationi convinced her, also, that the "baker's dozen of&#xD;
hired laborers, all his own kin folks," were an unnecessary&#xD;
and expensive set of idle parasites, of whom she determined&#xD;
to rid the plantation at the end of the year. She finally&#xD;
concluded still further to lower the scale of expenditures,&#xD;
by parting with her housekeeper. - She reconciled herself to&#xD;
this last step, when she heard of a place in the neighborhood&#xD;
to which Mrs. Mercer might go. Yet Catherine did not&#xD;
wisb to make these important changes without again consult-&#xD;
ing Major Clifton. And, perhaps-let the whole truth be&#xD;
told-perhaps poor Kate was desirous to hear from him, and&#xD;
glad of a fair business excuse to write. And she wrote the&#xD;
following note. She had some trouble with it, It was the&#xD;
first (except the lines at the funeral,) she had ever written&#xD;
him, and, under all the circumstances, she hesitated how to&#xD;
begin, or how ~o end it. She disliked to address him as a&#xD;
nt~re acquaintance, and she shrunk from any warmer manner&#xD;
of greeting. Finally, she wrote, as she would have written&#xD;
to a friend-.-thus~.--&#xD;
"WHITE CLIFFS, December 8th, 1812.&#xD;
"DEAR MAJOR CLIFTON&#xD;
"After a very careful investigation of the affairs of the&#xD;
plantation, and much patient. thought concerning them,&#xD;
I have concluded-if I have your approbation and authority&#xD;
for doing so~-4hat the establishment can be cut down&#xD;
so as to reduce the annual expenditure to about one-half&#xD;
its present amount-also, that the Hardbargain farm can&#xD;
be let for a sum, double the annual amount of~. what we&#xD;
can save at White Cliffs. And, finally, that the aggregate&#xD;
of these moneys, saved and acquired, will be sufficient, in&#xD;
two years, to pay off the accumulated debts oppressing the&#xD;
estate. (Here followed a more detailed account of her ~lans.~&#xD;
Please write, and let me know if I have your authority for&#xD;
jrceeeding.         . Yours, faithfully,&#xD;

In due time, Catherine received the answer. She seized&#xD;
it with an eager hand. She opened it with trembling fingers.&#xD;
She most unreasonably. hoped-poor girl-for some kind,&#xD;
relenting word-some token of approbation or affection.&#xD;
Truly, she believed in miracles. This was the precious&#xD;
epistle-&#xD;
"HAMPTON, December 16th, 1812.&#xD;

"Your favor of the 8th instant lies before me. I beg&#xD;

you think it proper to do so. I, myself, perhaps, should&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER XXXV.&#xD;
CATHERINE'S PROGRESS.&#xD;
And she grew a noble lady,&#xD;
And her people loved her much.-TE~wYsoN.&#xD;
CATHERI~E'~ arrangements for the year were all completed&#xD;
by the first of J~nuar~; and with less inconvenience to&#xD;
others, and consequently with less pain 'to herself, than she&#xD;
had dared to anticipate.&#xD;
* She heard that Turnbull, the cashiered overseer, had pur-&#xD;
chased a piece of land' ifl the valley- (doubtless with the&#xD;
embezzled funds, but of that she did not think)-built upon&#xD;
it a log cabin, and set :up as a farmer upon his own footing;&#xD;
and that he had taken his ~tribe of sons and nephews to assist&#xD;
him. She was' very much' pleased to know that they were&#xD;
but ~of the way of' swindling others as they. had 'swindled&#xD;
Clifton, and also that they were equally removed from want&#xD;
and offeringg.&#xD;
~#s. Mercer, byher warni recommendation, had found a&#xD;
very eligible situation~ as housekeeper to an elderly, single&#xD;
gentleman-a planter in the neighborhood.-and her benevo-&#xD;
lence was set at rest in regard to the old wo~nan.&#xD;
Lastly, she had let Hardbargain to excellent tenants-a&#xD;
young New Englander and his wife-who took it ready&#xD;
furnished and stocked as it was; and designed to work the&#xD;
land and keep a school.&#xD;
The negroes had their usual carnival at Christmas, lasting&#xD;
till after New Year-during which~ all that had been engaged&#xD;
in the last twelve months were married, and wedding parties&#xD;
were given and dances got up, ect., ect.&#xD;
But on the second of January, Catherine caused them all&#xD;
to be assembled in her presence, and told them that she&#xD;
should, on the next Monday and thereafter, set them to work&#xD;
in earnest; that their overseer was gone-(" Thank Marster&#xD;
Lord for that," exclaimed several)-but that she herself&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
189;&#xD;
&#xD;
would be their' overseer for the ensuing year. (" Y6u'll b~&#xD;
fair, young mistress! We ain't afeard o' you," said th~&#xD;
same.) She waved her hand for silence and attention, and&#xD;
tben informed them farther-..that though they should find&#xD;
her hereafter as heretofore, just and moderate and merciful ~&#xD;
ready to give ear' to their complaints, and settle their diffi~&#xD;
culties, and reward their zeal-yet that she should certainly&#xD;
require a more steady and systematic application to their&#xD;
duties than they had ever before given. She said, in conclu~&#xD;
sion, that their health, comfoi't, improvement and happiness,&#xD;
should be her care; but that even in this also, she should&#xD;
need their co-operatiou-.--(" You shall hab it, mist'ess, 'deed&#xD;
you shall, honey ;" from some of the older negroes.) Finally&#xD;
she dismissed them, telling them that she wished to see them&#xD;
all together again on Sunday evening at early candle-light,&#xD;
in the spinning-room, where she desired that they should as~&#xD;
semble quietly.&#xD;
On Saturday evening when the women were done spinning,'&#xD;
Catherine directed that all the wheels should be taken to one&#xD;
corner of the room, and crowded together, and that the set..&#xD;
tees and benches from the piazza and lawns, should be brought&#xD;
in and arranged around the walls; and finally, that ~. little&#xD;
reading stand and chair should be brought for her own use.&#xD;
These preparations, occupied but ten minutes, and the room&#xD;
was fitted up for family worship.&#xD;
On Sunday evening, at the appointed hour, Catherine ~et&#xD;
her assembled laborers and servants there. When they~wer~&#xD;
all seated and perfectly still and attentive, she said to them-&#xD;
"I desired your presenCe here this Sabbath evening, that I&#xD;
might make a proposition to you. I have been thinking that&#xD;
we ought not to finish ever~~ d~y withimt remembering and&#xD;
returning thanks to our Heavenly Father t'or'His daily bo~in~&#xD;
ties, protection and merCies to us, and asking a continuance&#xD;
of the same blessings; and I think we should not dare to lie&#xD;
down and commit ourselVea to that helpless sleep that so re-&#xD;
sembles death, withOut confessing to our Lord the sins we&#xD;
have committed again~tJIhn d~iring the day, imploring His&#xD;
forgiveness' of theni, aDd asking His watchful care over us&#xD;
~luring the darkness of the night and the defenoelessness of&#xD;
Ileep. Don't you think so V?&#xD;
"Yes, yes, mist'ess, we d0, We do ~ answered severed&#xD;

ran through the assembly. The negroes are strongly inclined&#xD;

&#xD;
to worship, and ever ready to co-operate in anything of that&#xD;
sacred character.&#xD;
Catherine resumed-~-&#xD;
"We should each do this in private by~ our own bedsides;&#xD;
but 'we should also do it together as 'a household.-as the&#xD;
creatures of one God, the children of one Father." She&#xD;
paused a moment in thought, and then spoke again. "I have&#xD;
been also reflecting that you ought all to know more of the1&#xD;
]3ible than you have as yet had any' opportunity of knowing;&#xD;
And I think that most of you would be pleased to know&#xD;
more." She paused for an answer.&#xD;
"Yes,' yes, mistress, we' do," chimed in many eager voices,&#xD;
old and young.&#xD;
"I know you do. Well, then, henceforth we will assemble&#xD;
in this room every evening just before bed time, and as a&#xD;
household of the Lord, a family of one~ Father, spend' a short&#xD;
time together in reading and hearing the Holy Scriptures, and&#xD;
in prayer. In beginning to read the Bible with you, I shall&#xD;
commence with~ the first 'chapter of the New Testament, and&#xD;
read a chapter every night, until we regularly read it 'through.&#xD;
And afterwards, in the same manner, ~we will go through&#xD;
lihivid's Psalms and the Prophets.&#xD;
Catherine finished and' sat down, mad.e a sign for silence,&#xD;
and opened the New~ Testament and commented her reading.&#xD;
Never had reader a more attentive1 or~ interested audience.&#xD;
She passed over the long,'hard genealogical table in the first&#xD;
par~V of the chapter, and began with the Angel's visit to the&#xD;
Virgin Mary, and read' also the second chapter, describing&#xD;
the bir~ and infancy of the Saviour~ sometimes stopping to&#xD;
give explanations, which she knew the 'simplicity of her au-&#xD;
dience made necessary. ' The family service was concluded&#xD;
with a prayer, and the: servants dismissed.&#xD;
And' this evening service became thenceforth a daily prac-&#xD;
tice. And Catherine's people learned mere of the life and&#xD;
doctrines of the Saviour' from her, than they would have ac-&#xD;
quired in a lifetime's attendance upon learned ministers, who&#xD;
preach 'only for the educated.&#xD;
On 'Monday moz~iing, Catherine entered upon her assumed&#xD;
duty of overseer. And never 'were the affairs of' a plantation&#xD;
better administered than by her. Her "good will was to it,"&#xD;
and all' her faculties brought to bear upon the business. And&#xD;
although she kept a firm hold upon: the reins of government~&#xD;
exacted the complete' fulfillment of 'every~ duty, and kept&#xD;

&#xD;
steadily at their post 'every man and' woman, yet never was&#xD;
a mistress more beloved and venerated. And certainly never&#xD;
was one so faithfully served. All subordinates need-not&#xD;
harsh nOn lax government-.but a steady, slystematic, rational&#xD;
government, which they can understand an~ be satisfied with;&#xD;
and such an one was that of Catherine. i~Ier administration&#xD;
was for her people a very wholesome change from the capri-&#xD;
cious tyranny of the late' overseer, who had been accustomed&#xD;
to permit the utmost license and larity 'among the laborers&#xD;
for four or five days, and then, growing alarmed, to hurry&#xD;
and worry, and drive and maltreat them for a week, to make&#xD;
up for lost time. Catherine's government was regular, firm,&#xD;
just and merciful. And she was loved, respected and served&#xD;
accordingly. There were some exceptions, but they were&#xD;
very few and unimportant, and soon fell under the general&#xD;
rule.&#xD;
And thus, in the perfect performance of every 'duty, do-&#xD;
mestic and social, that devolved upon her as wife, friend,&#xD;
mistress and Christian, Catherine passed the"winter. The&#xD;
spring 'brought the usual accession of busy work, and she&#xD;
gave herself up to its direction with untiring energy and ac-&#xD;
tivity. She prayed, and labored, and trusted in~IJeaven, and&#xD;
Heaven prospered her work, and all went well.' Before the&#xD;
first of June, she had paid off all those heavy notes, which&#xD;
had been accumulating interest so long. There were other&#xD;
heavy debts, but she saw her way clearly through, discharg..&#xD;
ing them before the end of the current year.&#xD;
But she never, lever heard from Major Clifton. He seemed&#xD;
just as lost to her as if the grave had received him. She&#xD;
took all 'the principal newspapers, for the sake of keeping&#xD;
the run of the campaign; and oh! often her cheeks and. very&#xD;
lips paled, and her heart sickened and sunk with terror, to&#xD;
read of the awful perils of war, and to thihk that he was ex-&#xD;
posed to them. But terror was not the only emotion raised&#xD;
by these descriptions of engagements. No-her whole sonl&#xD;
glowed with patriotic ardor, when she read of the gallant re-&#xD;
pulse of the combined land and naval forces of the British,&#xD;
under Admirals Warren and Cockburn, and General Sir&#xD;
Sydney B~ckwith, from Craney Island, by a mere handful of&#xD;
our troops; and her heart swelled with love and enthusiasm,&#xD;
when in the same account, she saw. her husband's name men-&#xD;
tioned with' the highest encomiums upon his bravery, discre-&#xD;
tion, and invaluable services.&#xD;

&#xD;
TIlE CURSE OF CLIFTC~N.&#xD;
&#xD;
Autumn came, bringing along with its.other associations,&#xD;
intensely distinct images of the last sweet, calm days she had&#xD;
passed at Hardbargain with her dying mother, and these&#xD;
vivid recollections stimulated afresh her devotion and her&#xD;
energy. During her administration, to clear the estate of&#xD;
debt, and at its close, to restore it unencumbered into the&#xD;
hands of her husband, was now her dear object. When the&#xD;
harvest was gathered in, she consulted several of her most&#xD;
intelligent and enterprising neighbors, concerning the state&#xD;
of the agricultural markets, and afterwards proceeded to&#xD;
Baltimore in person in order to obtain the best possible&#xD;
prices for her crops. She succeeded in effecting highly ad-&#xD;
vantageous sales, and with the proceeds she returned home&#xD;
and paid off several of those heavy debts.&#xD;
And so the autumn passed, and winter came, with its lei-&#xD;
sure, its stormy days, and its long nights. Nothingoccurred&#xD;
to break the monotony of daily life until the last of Decem-&#xD;
ber, when she collected the half year's rent from Hardbar-&#xD;
gain. arid paid off all the remaining debts, except one incon-&#xD;
siderable note of six hundred dollars. On the morning of&#xD;
the first of January, she sent as usual to the village post-&#xD;
~flice for her papers. When the boy returned, he, handed&#xD;
her a letter directed in the hand-writing of Major Clifton.&#xD;
Oh! joy at last !-she tore open the envelope, and sciz~d the&#xD;
enclosure-it was nothing but. a check' upon the Bank of&#xD;
Richmond for five hundred dollars. She let it fall unheeded,&#xD;
covered her face with her hands, and wept silently. But&#xD;
when her fit of sikut weeping was over, she arose, took the&#xD;
check, went and collected what money she had left in the house,&#xD;
and ordered her carriage and drove to IA , and lifted&#xD;
that last note. Then Catherine had the joy of seeing the&#xD;
property entirely free from debt.&#xD;
And so passed the winter and, came the spring of 1814.&#xD;
And still she heard nothing froni.M~ijor Clifton. And since&#xD;
reading the aceountof his galJant~ con4uct on Craney Island,&#xD;
she learned nothing Qf him. And still from her loop-hole of&#xD;
retreat, she anxiou~lywatched the progress of the war, seizing&#xD;
upon all the published accounts, and reading them with the&#xD;
greatest avidity. 116w diligently she searched the papers to&#xD;
~nd his name, and how eagerly h~r eyes~ th~rted down upon&#xD;
any offlcer~s name beginning with a C~ wbjch' always turned&#xD;
out to he CruteJi~eld, C~rbin, Carq, anythi~ig but Olifton!,&#xD;
Oh, how barren was all this war news,' after all!&#xD;
&#xD;
19$&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
But Admiral Cockburn's piratical fleet was now in the&#xD;
Chesapeake, spreading devastiktion and terror through all its&#xD;
islands, coasts, and tributary rivers; and every paper was&#xD;
filled with accounts of his marauding incursions and savage&#xD;
atrocities, that defied just description, much more exaggera-&#xD;
tion. Hear what a contemporary historian says of him;&#xD;
"Throughout the waters and shores of the Chesapeake,&#xD;
Admiral Cockburn now reigned supreme, ubiquitous and ir-&#xD;
resistible. The burglaries, larcenies, incendiarism~, and&#xD;
mere marauding, perpetrated by Admiral Cockburn, were as&#xD;
odious and ignoble, though less bloody and horrible, than the&#xD;
inhuman atrocities of the British savages in t~he West. Slaves&#xD;
in large numbers, large quantities of tobacco, furniture~ and&#xD;
other private property, protected by the laws of war, and&#xD;
seldom taken, even if destroyed by laud troops, were seized&#xD;
upon by the sea-faring warriors with piratical rapacity. The&#xD;
predatory attacks of the enemy in the Chesapeake were&#xD;
limited to isolated villages, poor farm-houses, and other in-&#xD;
defencible objects taken or destroyed. Destruction was the&#xD;
punishment proclaimed and executed for resistance. The&#xD;
house and barn were burned of whoever fired a shot, or drew&#xD;
a sword in self-defence. Many respectable persons in com-&#xD;
fortable circumstances were reduced to poverty by these de-&#xD;
predations. The poor were especial sufferers. With shores&#xD;
so indented ~with creeks and bays, the whole force of a State&#xD;
under arms would have been unequal~to cope with such over-&#xD;
whelming aggressors."&#xD;
Reading frequently such accounts as this, and even more&#xD;
alarming ones than this, is it strange that Catherine sickened&#xD;
with terror and anxiety for the safety of him who was exposed&#xD;
to all the horrors of this unsparing warfare.&#xD;
At length the shock came. It wa~ on the evening of the&#xD;
day after harvest-home, and she had giyen all her people a&#xD;
holiday, even down to the messenger whose daily duty it was&#xD;
to bring her papers from the post office, telling him that he&#xD;
might take the whole day, and bring her th~ mail when he&#xD;
returned home at night. Thu~,instead of receiving her pa-&#xD;
pers, as usual, in the ~morning, Catherine had to wait until&#xD;
~he boy's return in the evening. She waPs sitting in' the&#xD;
spinning-room, awaiting the assembling of her servants, whom&#xD;
she had just summoned to evening worship, wheii ihey all&#xD;
entered, aiid with them the post-boy; who came up and laid&#xD;
before her the single paper that had come that day... She:&#xD;

* took it, to lay aside until after the evening's devotions were&#xD;
oVer-but a magic name on the outside arrested her attention.&#xD;
She caught up the paper, and read in large capitals:&#xD;
"ENOAGEMENT AT ST. LEONARD'S. British forces under&#xD;
.Rdmiral Cockburn repulsed with considerable loss. .Major&#xD;
Cliftoft dangerQ~zsly wounded."&#xD;
She re3d no farther-~--the room swam around her-she&#xD;
reeled, and fell into the arms of Henny, who sprang forward&#xD;
to reeefve her. Her people crowded around her, in great&#xD;
anxiety. But only one moment she fainted thus-then she&#xD;
recovered, controlled herself, resumed her seat, and after&#xD;
sending the servants all back to their places, by a wave of&#xD;
her hand, opened the Bible, and commenced the evening's&#xD;
exercises. Her face was very pale, her bands quivered in&#xD;
turning the leaves, and her voice faltered, so as to be nearly&#xD;
inaudible, but she persevered, and got through with the ser-&#xD;
vice, even unto the benediction~, After it was all over, she&#xD;
detained them a moment, by a gesture, and then said-&#xD;
"Your master has been dangerously wounded."&#xD;
Murmurs of surprise, grief and anxiety agitated the assem-&#xD;
bly, and testified to their affectionate concern.&#xD;
"Go now quietly to your homes, and to-morrow perhaps&#xD;
I may be able to tell you more."&#xD;
They dispersed slowly, turning glances of uneasiness and&#xD;
distress ~t the silent anguish of her countenance.&#xD;
She too, went out. How she spent the night is best known&#xD;
to Heaven. In the morDing when she appeared among her&#xD;
household-the wasted cheeks, the sunken eyes, the hollow&#xD;
temples, ~tid the wi~itten agony of the brow, atone&#xD;
consuming sorrow of her he~art.            proved the&#xD;
"Jack-I want Jack," she said, as soon as sbe reached&#xD;
her parlor. Atid the favorite servant appeared ~before her.&#xD;
"Jack, I think you love, me," she said.&#xD;
"Try me, mist'ess dear, an'. see; ef I doesn't.".&#xD;
"And Irthink you love your master V' -&#xD;
Ah! my' Lor'! Try me-jes on'y try me, mist'ess-.--&#xD;

'f I wish y~u to go to him from, me."&#xD;
"Oh! iio-do-do-~.-do sen' me, mistress! It's war I&#xD;
longs for to be."&#xD;
~" I shall. The distance is over a hundred. xuiles. You&#xD;

"'Deed, mistress, I won't lot de grass grow onnerneaf of&#xD;

"Very well, then, go now-have you had your break-&#xD;

" Yes, ma~am~~~&#xD;
"Go now, then, and prepare for your journey, while I&#xD;
write you a pass. And~ when you are quite ready, come to&#xD;
me, and I will give you farther directions about your jour-&#xD;
ney."&#xD;
Jack hastened out-and his mistress remained for a few&#xD;
minutes, with her hands pressed to her heart, repeating to&#xD;
herself, with agonizing earnestness-&#xD;
"Would-oh !-would to Heaven, I too, might go." Soon&#xD;
she started, as with sudden recollection, and hurried off to&#xD;
write the pass, and the directions about the road. And when&#xD;
in less than half an hour Jack appeared before her again, she&#xD;
was ready for' him. "Here," she said, "is your pass, and&#xD;
written directions, lest you should forget what I tell you."&#xD;
"Nebber fear me forgetting , x~iist'ess, dear."&#xD;
"You must take the road to Alexandria, which is seventy&#xD;
miles from here. When you reach that town, take the ferry-&#xD;
boat and cross the Potomac to the Maryland side. Then in~&#xD;
quire your road to the village of Benedict, on the Patuxent,&#xD;
which is thirty or forty miles further down the country.&#xD;
When you reach the village, ask the way to St. Leonard's.&#xD;
Arrived at your journey's end, find Colonel Wadsworth, or&#xD;
Major Stuart, or Captain Miller, show your pass and tell your&#xD;
errand, and they will direct you where to find your master.&#xD;
Do you understand ~"&#xD;
"Yes, mist'ess."&#xD;
"All this that I have toLd you is written down here on&#xD;

and lose your way.~~&#xD;
"Yes, ma'am, I'll be berry cautiencious."&#xD;
"And now listen to me, Jack ;" her voice broke down,&#xD;
some emotion seeme&amp;amp; struggling in her bosom for expres.-&#xD;
sion-.she quelled it and went on-" When you find your&#xD;

CHAPTER XXXVI.&#xD;
THE NIGI~T JOURNEY.&#xD;
The heart on'ee broken by the loved,&#xD;
Is strong to meet the foemen.-MRs. BROWNING.&#xD;
NEARLY a fortnight of extreme anxiety passed away, during&#xD;
which Catherine heard nothing from her rn~ssenger. On the&#xD;
evening of the thirteenth day of his departure, however, a&#xD;
letter was brought to her, directed in the well-known, but&#xD;
alas! not very familiar hand-writing of Major Clifton. Oh,&#xD;
joy! He was living then, and even well enough to write.&#xD;
With a fervent ejaculation of deep gratitude to Heaven, she&#xD;
broke the seal. But her face paled as ~he read-.&#xD;
"ON BOAUD THE BRITISH 51111? ALBION, ~&#xD;

"Are you then destined to be forever fatal, not only to&#xD;

was itot dangerously wounded, as the iveWspapers reported,&#xD;
but slightly hurt, and taken prisoner, and conveyed gj' board&#xD;

poor fellow, whom you sent on this death's errand, not find-&#xD;

procured a boat at Benedict, and came out 'alongside 'thi~&#xD;

venience is nothing beside his cruel fate-yet, nevertheless,&#xD;
I may as well inform you that I, who was upon parole, when&#xD;
your messenger sought to 'communicate with me, have also to&#xD;
thank your interference for being put i~inder arrest, and no-&#xD;
thing but the relaxation of strict discipline, incident upon&#xD;
the departure of the two commanders, and a mere fortuity,&#xD;
affords me the opportunity of, writing, and sending this note.&#xD;
Admiral Cockburn and General Ross are now on their march&#xD;
to Washington City. And my object in writing to you is&#xD;
merely this: to assure you)liy all my hopes of salvation, that&#xD;
unless you, in your unequaled machiavelisni, find some way&#xD;
of saving this boy from death, I will never see, or speak to&#xD;
you again.                   ARCHflR CLIFTON."&#xD;
Still clasping the letter, her hand and head fell with .a&#xD;
gesture of utter despair.&#xD;
"Why, what's de matter, Miss Kate, honey? no bad news,&#xD;
I tins'," said Ilenny.&#xD;
A deep, heart-breaking sob only answered her.&#xD;
"My goodness, Miss Kate, deary, what is it den? ismarster&#xD;
dead? Oh, deary me, Miss Kate, chile, don't keep on look-&#xD;
ing dat a way-'deed, you puts a scare, on to .me !-don't!&#xD;
'Sider how it's de Lord's will, honey, an' let de tears come,&#xD;
let de tears come, chile ! Do, honey. 'Deed, troubles like&#xD;
de zneasles; ef it don't break out, it strikes in an' kills you&#xD;
dead__"&#xD;
A gasp from Catherine, and a gesture imploring silence,&#xD;
while she ~panned her temples with both hands, and tried to&#xD;
think clearly.&#xD;
"My gracious, Miss:Kate, dont look so ghashly; honey-&#xD;
don't. Is master dead, sure enough ?"&#xD;
"He's not dead, be's not dead," said Catherine, huskily,&#xD;
*hile s~e waved her hand for peace.&#xD;
"*Well, den, honey, long as der's life der'~ hope, an' no&#xD;
casion for 'spair. Is he berry bad, honey ?"&#xD;
"He's well-well," said Catherine, in the same tone.&#xD;
"Well, den, long as he's well; what 'easion yon take on&#xD;
so, honey-----Oh! my Lor'-taint-taint poor brother Jack&#xD;
as anything's happened to ?"&#xD;
* "Oh, flenny! Your master and Jack have both been&#xD;
taken prisoners by Admiral, Cockburn!".&#xD;
"Oh, Miss Kate! Oh, my Lor', Miss Kate! An' dey&#xD;
&#xD;
do tell me how he eats his prisoners 'live," exclaimed Henny,&#xD;
falling down into a chair, flinging her check apron over her&#xD;
head,, and beginning to cry.&#xD;
Almost' heedless of her handmaid's violent demonstra-&#xD;
tions of grief 'and terror, Catherine walked 'up and down the&#xD;
floor, witI~ her hands 'clasped around her temples, in the very&#xD;
agony of thought. To save the boy from death-how was&#xD;
she, at that remote distance, to save him? Oh! it seemed a&#xD;
mockery, a snare, to put forgiveness upon such an impracti-&#xD;
cable condition! Yet she thought him no setter of snares.&#xD;
She thought over the whole of the letter, searching' for a&#xD;
hint; she needed not to look at i 'gain-every line and&#xD;
word was burned in upon her brain and heart-she thought&#xD;
over the whole of it, earnestly searching for a clue to action.-&#xD;
she found' it at length in the phrases, "He only waits the&#xD;
Admiral's order for execution," and "Admiral Cockburn and&#xD;
generall Ross are now on their march to Washington City."&#xD;
She thought if she could see the Admiral, she might yet save&#xD;
his life-of so little worth ~s a sacrifice to the enemy, but of&#xD;
such inestimable value to her. 'The date of the letter was&#xD;
the twenty-first-this day was the twenty-third. "Oh! he&#xD;
is probably executed by this time," said DesponAency. "But&#xD;
possibly not," said Hope. She tried to think clearly, to sepa.~&#xD;
rate the dreadful chaos of thought and passion, and to weigh&#xD;
and adjust circumstances, so as she might decide and act&#xD;
promptly. Admiral Cockburn and Ge~ral Ross must be&#xD;
near 'WashingtQn, if they had not already reached the city~&#xD;
Washington was two 'full day's journey 'from her home,&#xD;
but every 'hour was precious, for life and death might hang&#xD;
upon it. She could perform the journey in a day and night.&#xD;
11cr resolution was taken.' Going up to where lenny sat&#xD;
crying, and rocking, herself "backward and forward, she&#xD;
said-. '&#xD;
"Rise, Ilenny, and go and tell James to saddle my horse,&#xD;
my rough 'coated pony, Henny, he is the strongest and the&#xD;
fleetest, an~d bring him around to the door."&#xD;
"Oh, Miss Kate!, ~does you think he'll eat 'em sure&#xD;

~ "What do you mean, Henny.-.are you crazy ?"&#xD;
"Admirable Cockbu'n, houcy. Does you think he'll eat&#xD;

a hasty note to her neighbor,~the down-east tenant of Hard-&#xD;
bargain, requesting hi~ to givo a slight supervision of affairs&#xD;
at White Cliffs during her absence for a few~ days. By the&#xD;

As he left the room, Henny entered it with' the riding-&#xD;

'KDear me, mistress, honey; 'where's you gwine ?"~ '&#xD;

"To Washington 'P' exclaimed Henny, letting the dress&#xD;
fall from her hands, and looking up in stupor.&#xD;

Catherine waved her hand in adieu, gave reins to her pony,&#xD;
which bounded beneath her, and seemed to fly over the lawn.&#xD;
She\ was fevered, excited.-" mad inspired," say either.&#xD;
Night was closing darkly around her, but its sedative sha-&#xD;
dows had no power to soothe her excited nerves-the dews&#xD;
were falling, but they had no efficacy to coof her fevered&#xD;
veins; a long journey lay before her, but iti length could&#xD;
not discourage her; dangers were thickly strown about her&#xD;
path, but they could not appall her; her only desire, her&#xD;
only anxiety, was to reach her destination in season, if pos-&#xD;
sible, to rescue this boy from death, because he was dear to&#xD;
Clifton-dearer than she herself, his wife, was, she now&#xD;
thought; and now her life itself seemed of little worth,&#xD;
since the hope that was life's earthly end, was laid low.&#xD;
Her only remaining hope was to save this life-her only&#xD;
remaining fear, to fail in doing so.&#xD;
Her path, for many miles, lay through the deep, intermi-&#xD;
nable wilderness of forest, that, rising and falling with the&#xD;
low mountain ranges, extended over more than half the&#xD;
county. Her path was so narrow, and the branches 'of the&#xD;
trees often so low and interlaced, that a single start of her&#xD;
horse, or a single moment's hesitation to bow hei head,&#xD;
might have dashed her brains out against the intersecting&#xD;
branches of the trees. And ~in, ,the deep darkness of the&#xD;
night, and in the despairing ~bse~ce~of her perceptive facul-&#xD;
ties, this danger beset her ~evety~ i~tsti~nt. But she rode on,&#xD;

bulist, strangely preserved. As night deepened, and low..&#xD;
ered, and thickened around her in the awful depths of the&#xD;
wilderness, the distant howl of the hungry wolf, the nearer&#xD;
cry of the fierce wild cat, and once the more fearful whistle-'~&#xD;
signal of some outlawed desperado fell upon her ear. But&#xD;
even these appalling . sounds struck no terror to a heart,&#xD;
stunned by despair into insensibility to danger. And she&#xD;
rode on through these terrific perils, strangely unconscious,&#xD;
and strangely protected.&#xD;
At length, as she descended the last steep, and drew near&#xD;
to the outskirts of the wilderness, the lights of the small&#xD;
village of L gleamed. through the interstices of the&#xD;
woods-appearing and disappearing, jack-o'-lanternlike, until&#xD;
she emerged from the forest and came, full upon the hamlet.&#xD;
It was so late at night, that all the houses were shut and&#xD;
dark, and the only lights were those she had seen in the fo-&#xD;
rest,-the lights of the stage and post office. She passed&#xD;
like a meteor through the gloomy street, eliciting only a&#xD;
"What the deuce was that V' from a loiterer in the stage-&#xD;
office, who had seen her flight, and emerged again upon an&#xD;
open plain, over which her road lay for many miles. Another&#xD;
village gleamed up from the plains-was reached, passed,&#xD;
and left far behind with the same lightning-like speed.&#xD;
* - She rode all night, less .sensible to danger and fatigue than&#xD;
the hardy little mountain pony that was carrying her light&#xD;
weight, but straining every nerve and sinew in the service.&#xD;
The night was deeply dark-the clouds thick, heavy and&#xD;
lowering; she had no means of computing time Or distance,&#xD;
but farn~s, forests and fields continued to loom, appear and&#xD;
*   vanish, as she fled past them. She watched the East with&#xD;
feverish anxiety f~r day. But still mountain, meadow, and&#xD;
moorland came and went, as she approached and hurried&#xD;
by them, and still deep darkness hung like a pall over&#xD;
Heaven and earth. Vainly she watched the East, for&#xD;
hamlet, village or town iii turn was seen and reached and left&#xD;
* behind, and still a wall of dense blackness blocked, up the&#xD;
Orient.&#xD;
A ifew and very serious danger threatened her every in~&#xD;
stant-her poor horse, fatigued nearly to death, was re~dy to&#xD;
fall, and she did not know it. He reeled and totter4 and&#xD;
-stumbled and coveredd himself many times, and she did not&#xD;
see or feel it! nay, she mechanically exerted every norve&#xD;
~and sinew to hold him up, and keep him on his feet, while&#xD;
&#xD;
totally unconscious of her own exertion. Like a sleep&#xD;
walker was she in. her deep abstraction.&#xD;
She was in a deep forest again riding for life, and the&#xD;
veins in her arms were swelled out like cords, with straining&#xD;
to hold the horse up on his feet. She could no longer see the&#xD;
Eastern horizon, but it was growing lighter, and she knew that&#xD;
morning was dawning. She rode on, and on, and on, and&#xD;
at length came out of the forest in time to see the level rays&#xD;
of the rising sun striking redly across the fields. The win-&#xD;
dows of a farm-house flashing back the early light gleamed&#xD;
upon her vision, and at the same time her horse reeled and&#xD;
fell with her. "Good Lord !" "Are you hurt P' "Run&#xD;
here, Tim." "Call your mistress, Peter." "Where are you&#xD;
hurt, lady ~ can you tell us&#xD;
Catherine awoke as *out of a dream, to see many people&#xD;
around her all asking questions, and all attei~npting to extri-&#xD;
cate her from her saddle. She passed her hand across her&#xD;
brow, as was her wont when trying to disp~il thought, and&#xD;
she looked at them in perplexity.&#xD;
"My Lord, I'm afraid she's very much hurt! Can you&#xD;
speak, lady ~ Where is your injury ~" said the eldest man&#xD;
of the party, at length, lifting her in his arms.&#xD;
"I-no-Pm not hurt-not the least; is the horse ~"&#xD;
"We don't know, ma'am; I'm sure it's a blessed thing&#xD;
you're not killed yourself," said another of~ the group, who,&#xD;
with several more, were trying to raise the pony upon his&#xD;
legs.&#xD;
"Pray put me down upon my feet. Thank you. I'm not&#xD;
hurt. How far is Washington City from this place V' said&#xD;
Catherine, as she stood v~atching her horse.&#xD;
"Good forty miles, lady. I don't think he's hurt, but&#xD;
poor fellow, he's trembling with fi~igue," said the farmer,&#xD;
answering her, and then examining the horse, which was&#xD;
raised at last and stood tremblitig and blowing.&#xD;
"Can he take me to Washington to-day '?" asked Cathe-&#xD;
rine, as she leaned against the fence for support.&#xD;
"He ?-Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! Why look at him, lady!&#xD;
Besides, can you go there yourself anyhow ~ Why you're&#xD;
ready to drop now! *Better go in and let the old woman&#xD;
put you to bed and give you some breakfast."&#xD;
"It is true I'm very stiff and weary-having ridden all&#xD;
night. But I must reach Washington without delay; there&#xD;
is one I care about under sentence of death. If I reach&#xD;

there in time, I may get a reprieve and save him. I must&#xD;
go to-day." Catherine spoke this, frequently pausing for&#xD;
breath. When she ceased,-&#xD;
"Some of her nationss gwine to be hung, an' she gwine to&#xD;
see President Madison to get him off! May depen', that's&#xD;
it !" whispered one farm laborer to another.&#xD;
"Can you let me have a horse to take me there to-day ~&#xD;
I will paytwice.'-.ten times his value," said Catherine, raising&#xD;
her~ heavy eyelids to the old farmer's kind face.&#xD;
"Lady, I'll let you have another horse in two hours from&#xD;
this, on condition 'that you go in to my old woman and take&#xD;
some refreshment, and lie down to rest for that time. And&#xD;
not a minute sooner, and not on any other terms whatsoever,&#xD;
even if it was your father was going to be banged-would I&#xD;
let you have a horse; because I see very clearly that, unless&#xD;
you take some rest, you will drop down dead before you get'&#xD;
a mile farther on your road."&#xD;
"It is true-it is the voice of Providence, I think-I&#xD;
thank you very much; II will rest. Please take care of my&#xD;
poor pony."&#xD;
"He shall be looked after, lady. Take my arm." And&#xD;
the worthy farmer drew Catherine's arm within his own, and&#xD;
carefully aiid respectfully supported her to the house, where&#xD;
he gave .her into the charge of his wife, saying, "here, wait&#xD;
upen this lady, honey! be a mother to her, honey! for she's&#xD;
sorrowfully in want of one."&#xD;
The farmer's wife placed her in a stuffed chair, drew off&#xD;
her gloves, untied her hat and removed it, unfastened her&#xD;
spencer, and asked her if she would have breakfast, which&#xD;
was just ready to go on the table.&#xD;
"No, thank you.. You are very kind. The Lord reward&#xD;
you. But-rest, I want only rest," said Catheripe, ready te&#xD;
swoon, for the sense of fatigue was growing. upon her.&#xD;
"' Yes, rest,, that's all she wants, or rather that's the most&#xD;
she wants now! Put her to bed! let her sleep for two.hou.rs,&#xD;
~nd have a cup of strong coffee and .a broiled chicken ready&#xD;
for her when she wakes. That will set her up again, and&#xD;
help her to reach her journey's end," said the kind-hearted&#xD;
man.&#xD;
Supported, by the farmer's wife, Catherine was guided up&#xD;
the stairs to a cool and,, quiet room, where she dropped upon&#xD;
the bed. No sooner ha~d her head touched the pillow, than&#xD;
the room,4he whitewashedd wall, blue window-curtains, the&#xD;

&#xD;
evergreens in the whitened fire-place, the picture of the an-&#xD;
nunciation over the mantle-piece--all reeled around her&#xD;
senses as a vision, and wheeled 4off, carrying with them the&#xD;
outside world and all consciousness of being.&#xD;
To her, existence was blotted out for two ~hours.&#xD;
"Wake up, lady! wake up! your breakfast is ready, and&#xD;
so is your horse !"&#xD;
Catherine started up at the voice of her landlady, and&#xD;
gazed around, bewildered. Then memory flashed upon her,&#xD;
and she sprung to her feet, and began hastily and nervously&#xD;
to fasten her habit.&#xD;
"Here is water, lady,~and napkins-and is there anything&#xD;
else IL can bring you $"&#xD;
"No, thank you, you are very good."&#xD;
"How do you find yourself P'&#xD;
Bette~-III think. How lorg have I slept I"&#xD;
"Just two hours. I wished to let you lie longer, but my&#xD;
dear old fellow insisted on keeping his word with you."&#xD;
"I'm glad he did. It was very needful. But you are&#xD;
kind, and I thank you."&#xD;
Catherine bathed her head and face, and the good hostess&#xD;
combed and arranged her hair, and fastened her habit 'and&#xD;
took her down stairs, where a comfortable breakfast awaited&#xD;
her. It was yet but seven o'clock, and the farmer assured,&#xD;
her that she had time enough to reach Washington by night-&#xD;
fall and that she would be far better able to do it from&#xD;
having had this rest. She hastily swallowed a few mouthfuls&#xD;
of food, drank a cup of strong coffee, that gave her a sort&#xD;
of fictitious strength, and then arose from the table and&#xD;
quickly prepared to resume her journey. The good woman&#xD;
followed her with many kind wishes, and the good man set&#xD;
her in her saddle, a.1d while adjusting her comfortably, gave&#xD;
* directions about the nearest way to W-, the i~ext con-&#xD;
siderable town upon the road. Then lie gave her the reins,&#xD;
and prayed 0-od to bless her. She, thanked her kind hosts&#xD;
earnestly again, put whip to her horse and galloped away,&#xD;
leaving her valuable pony in pledge.&#xD;

found herself in the open meadows, it was high noon, and the&#xD;
August sun was pouring down his burning rays with intqler~..&#xD;
ide power. I3ut on and on she rode, unconscious of suffering&#xD;
in herself, and unheedful of the fatigue of her panting and&#xD;
perspiring steed.&#xD;
It was two hours past noon when she reached the town of&#xD;
W , and at the very first inn on the suburbs her horse&#xD;
stopped, of his own will, nor could she, with all her efforts,&#xD;
persuade or force him to budge a step. A l~oy, a colored&#xD;
woman, and then the landlord, his wife and all the children&#xD;
came out, to see a lady riding, unattended, who could not&#xD;
make her horse go.&#xD;
*" He wants food and drink, I suppose," said Catherine, to&#xD;
the landlord, who at last caine to offer her aid. And then&#xD;
she alighted, and requesting the host to have the animal at-&#xD;
tended, very quickly, followed the landlady, who conducted her&#xD;
into the rustic parlor. She was now so fatigued and stiffened,&#xD;
that the .act of standitig or walking was really painful, so&#xD;
she sank down upon the lounge, and declining all the land-&#xD;
lady's offers of refreshment, waited a weary half hour, while&#xD;
her horse was feeding. At the and of that time, she mounted&#xD;
again, and resumed her journey. She passed through the&#xD;
town, and over the wooded hills that environed it on the&#xD;
east, and came down upon the plains. - The heat of the after-&#xD;
noon was of that close, breathless, insufferable kind, that&#xD;
always forebodes an awful storm. The sense of suffering&#xD;
was beginning to force itself upon her, and as for the animal&#xD;
she rode, she could not, by any means, coax or drive him&#xD;
beyond a walk. Then her mind became again anxiously&#xD;
concentrated upon the end of her journey, to the total ex-&#xD;
clusion of all other thought, and all sense. It was in this&#xD;
state that she arrived at the foot of a steep hill, covered with&#xD;
copse-wood, ascended its top, descended the other side, and&#xD;
reached a small river at its foot. She drew up her feet,&#xD;
doubled her riding-skirt np over the horse's shoulders, and&#xD;
guided him into the ford, and-with tbe water splashing&#xD;
around, and rising even to the animal's neck, she crossed&#xD;
the river-~so mechanically, so unconsciously, that had people&#xD;
asked her, thereafter, whether~ she had forded a stream in her&#xD;
journey, she could not have tdd them.&#xD;
The sun wasp declining to+his setting, and, the sky was&#xD;

before long of a tremendous tornado. The shades of even-&#xD;
ing were falling thickly around her when she was passing&#xD;
through the dense, low-lying forest south-west of Washing-&#xD;
ton. W~ien she emerged from its deep obscurity and came&#xD;
out into the open country, an alarming phenomenon~arrested&#xD;
her attention; the eastern horizon was luridly lighted by a&#xD;
low, dull, red glow, like the earliest dawn of a wintry morn-&#xD;
ing. Her road led directly towards this murky light, and&#xD;
her eyes were fascinated to it. As she rode and gazed, the&#xD;
blood-tinged illumination seemed to glow and brighten on her&#xD;
vision, and presently after, began to send up meteoric streams&#xD;
of fire towards the clouds. As the distance lessened between&#xD;
herself and the awful conflagration, it began to illumine her&#xD;
path more and more distinctly and fearfully, until every ob-&#xD;
ject for miles around was plainly visible in the lurid glare.&#xD;
And then at last Catherine recognized it for a burning city-&#xD;
the city of Washington wrapped in flames!&#xD;
On descending the road towards the Potomac,~ a scene&#xD;
difficult to describe met her view. All up and down the river&#xD;
and on either shore, were seen in the red glare multitudes&#xD;
of fugitives-some seeking to cross, some in boats on the&#xD;
water, and some landed and hurrying in disorder up the&#xD;
country. Soon after this, she met great numbers of terrified&#xD;
women and children, flying from their desolated homes. The&#xD;
greatest possible consternation and confusion prevailed among&#xD;
these panic-stricken fugitives. The most terrific reports&#xD;
were rife: That the enemy were in hot pursuit-that the&#xD;
slaves had been incited to revolt, and mad with emancipa-&#xD;
tion, and drunk with all manner of licentious excess, were&#xD;
perpetrating more horrible and revolting atrocities than those&#xD;
which at Hampton, the year before,~steeped the country in&#xD;
blood and shame.&#xD;
Rendered by despair senseless as tIAle dead to all these&#xD;
dangers, Catherine laboriously pushed and threaded her way&#xD;
down the road, blocked up with horses, carriages, foot-pas-&#xD;
sengers, baggage wagons, cattle, and all the miscellaneous&#xD;
emptying of a hastily and fearfully evacuated city. As she&#xD;
drew near the Long Bridg~ she heard by the frightened&#xD;
talk of the flying multitude, that the end of the bridge on&#xD;
the Virginia side had ~been burned to prevent, or at least&#xD;
delay, the pursuit of the enemy. She then turned her horse's&#xD;
head up the course ofthe 'rivei~, with the intention of~orossing&#xD;
by' the Georgetown Ferry.. 'She had no trouble in picking&#xD;

&#xD;
~her way through the thicket under the hill5 that bordered the&#xD;
Potomac from this point, for every minutest object on the&#xD;
way was made painfully distinct by the light of the burning&#xD;
city. When nearly opposite Georgetown, she described the&#xD;
ferry-boat put off from the other shore, and propel1~d rapidly&#xD;
across the river. She stopped her horse, intending to wait&#xD;
and return with it. In less than five minutes it touched the&#xD;
beach, and a carriage with a small party of ladies, escorted&#xD;
by a guard of nine cavalry volunteers~ landed.&#xD;
In the hurried consultation that ensued among them,&#xD;
Catherine learned that the party consisted of Mrs. Madison&#xD;
and her friends and attendants, flying from the burning&#xD;
Presidential Mansion. When they had turned their horses'&#xD;
heads up the river road, Catherine rode down to the boat,&#xD;
and addressed herself to the ferryman, asking to be taken&#xD;
~over. The man looked at her iii astonishment, and when he&#xD;
saw that she was in earnest, advised her strongly against the&#xD;
trip, telling 'her that she had best turn rein and ride as fas't&#xD;
and as far as possible in the opposite direction-that every&#xD;
one l~ad fled or was flying from Washington, that the city&#xD;
was in the undisputed possession of the enemy, who were&#xD;
domolishii~g, burning and laying waste the metropolis at&#xD;
pleasure. There was no need to tell that-the fact was&#xD;
awfully visible by the light of the great conflagration. But&#xD;
Catherine still persisted in her purpose, replying to his ob-'.&#xD;
jections that some one whom she did not wish to desert was&#xD;
in the hands of the enemy; and at last prevailed upon him&#xD;
to put her across.&#xD;
She was landed on the flats west of the city. Here crowds&#xD;
of women and children, pale with terror, ~nd weeping and&#xD;
wailing for their ruined city and lost homes, waited impa-&#xD;
tiently to be taken across the river, out of the way of more&#xD;
horrible fates, which the' atrocious reputation of Cockburn&#xD;
and his Cossaeks'reasonably taught them to dread. Cathe-&#xD;
rine left them hurrying in mad confusion into the boat, while&#xD;
she hastened on to the very ~cene of peril from which thcy&#xD;
were flying. She passed swiftly over the low and marshy&#xD;
fields that then lay between the river and the heart of the&#xD;
city, and entered upon Twenty-%lrst Street, above the War&#xD;
Department, and turned into Pennsylvania Avenue.&#xD;
What a scene! Volumes o~' smoke, as from an enormous&#xD;
volcano, were disgorged in inas~ive clouds, and settled like a&#xD;
black canopy over the doc~nied city.. The President's Palace&#xD;

&#xD;
and the Treasury Building, swathed in their shrouds of fire,&#xD;
illumined all the scene with terrific splendor. Even at the&#xD;
distance of several hundred yards off, her eyes ached with&#xD;
the insufferable light and scorching heat. At the distance&#xD;
of a mile, the CapitQl, wrapped in its mantle of flame, sent&#xD;
forth a hail-storm of sparks and burning brands.&#xD;
In strange and awful contrast to this appalling progress of&#xD;
destruction, was the dread silence that reigned over the fall-&#xD;
ing city. All the terror, consternation, hurry and distrac-&#xD;
tion were left, without. Here, upon the very scene of action,&#xD;
all was comparatively quiet. The houses were shut up, and&#xD;
if. they contained any inmates, they were hiding in obscurity.&#xD;
The streets seemed forsaken by the conquerors, as by the&#xD;
conquered. There was no shout of soldiery, no martial music,&#xD;
no sign or expression of a grand military triumph anywhere,&#xD;
no sound to be heard from the powerful enemy in possession,&#xD;
except a distant, dull, heavy, monotonous tramp, as of many&#xD;
retreating hoofs. The flames were doing theii~ work of de-&#xD;
struction in silence, only broken by the occasional crash of&#xD;
some falling roof, cupola, or pillar, or some reverberating ex-&#xD;
plosion. Catherine passed under' the blinding glare and&#xD;
scathing heat of the burning Treasury Building, and turning&#xD;
the elbow of the Avenue, came upon a sentinel,~ who instantly&#xD;
levelled- his musket and challenged her, with "Who goes&#xD;
there ~"&#xD;
"The Admiral," said Catherine, drawing rein.&#xD;
The sentinel lowered his musket with a surly "Pass on,"&#xD;
followed by a low, insulting comment. Catherin~ had merely&#xD;
intended to express her errand, and had chanced upon the&#xD;
countersign.&#xD;
"Where shall I find your commander V' she next said.&#xD;
"The. General ?"&#xD;
"No-Admiral Coekburn."&#xD;
"Corporal," said the soldier, in a low, distinct voice. The&#xD;
Corporal of the Guard advanced.&#xD;
"What did you want, mum ~"&#xD;
"To be conducted to the presence of the Admiral," an-&#xD;
swered Catherine, with an imploring glance. Perhaps some-&#xD;
thing in her countenance moved the pity of the officer-.&#xD;
perhaps he thought her a sufferer~from the devastation of the&#xD;
city. At least he volunteered to b~ her guide, and request-&#xD;
ing her to accompany him, led the way down the avenue&#xD;
towards the Capitol.&#xD;

"Did you know, mum, that a curfew had been proclaimed;&#xD;
and the ~ forbidden to ~ in the streets after eight&#xD;
o'clock in the evening ?" 1&#xD;
"No, and if I had, I should have been still obliged to&#xD;
disregard it, for a matter of more than life and death hangs&#xD;
upon my interview with the Admiral," replied Catherine,&#xD;
speaking out of the fullness of her heart.&#xD;
The distance between the Treasury Building and the Cape&#xD;
itol ~vas about one mile, and the glare of the conflagration at&#xD;
each end, revealed a line of sentinels, posted at regular in-&#xD;
tervals the whole length of the avenue.&#xD;
A ride of ten minutes brought them to the encampment&#xD;
of the enemy on the Capitol Hill, east of the burning edi-&#xD;
fice. Here, indeed, prevailed much of the noise and disorder&#xD;
consequent upon the relaxation of discipline after a day of&#xD;
severe action. Nearly four thousand men were resting, some&#xD;
leaning upon their muskets, some seated' upon the grass, and&#xD;
some flat upon the ground, in the death-like sleep of drunk-&#xD;
enness or exhaustion.&#xD;
A group of officers, with their gorgeous scarlet and gold&#xD;
laced dresses resplendent in the glare, stood watching' the&#xD;
progress of the fire. Towards these the Corporal conducted&#xD;
Catherine. One from among them advanced, laughing&#xD;
coarsely, as he exclaimed-" Who have we got here, Corpo-&#xD;
ral ?-a woman, by George! and a young and pretty one, too,&#xD;
to judge by the pretty figure. You're welcome, madam.&#xD;
What, afraid ~ - Well, I suppose you have formed a terrible&#xD;
opinion o~ me from ,the newspapers, which delight to repre-&#xD;
sent us ~ as devils. Never fear me. Satan is not half so&#xD;
black as. ~he saints paint him! You shall be far safer under&#xD;
my. goveri~iment than 'uiAer Madison'sq Ross says he makes&#xD;
no war upon letters or ladies. Ho, ho, ho! Ross-he's&#xD;
sentimental, you know! Well! d- letters, but I make&#xD;
no war upon ladies either, except with Cupid's weapons-ho,&#xD;
ho, ho, ho, ho! What, afraid still. Come! let's see your&#xD;
face;~ never saw a shy woman yet that had not a face worth&#xD;
seeing."&#xD;
Abashed at this manner of address, Catherine hung her&#xD;
head, until the Corporal whispered-&#xD;
"Rear Admiral Cockburn."&#xD;
Then she stole a glance at the speaker.&#xD;
A flashy, overdressed, yet slovenly person, a florid com-&#xD;
&#xD;
plexion, a clear, mirthful, audacious blue eye-a sensual&#xD;
mouth, and a free, dashing, insolent mapnei~, marked the&#xD;
licensed Pirate of the Chesapeake, and the boon companion&#xD;
of the profligate Prince of Wales.&#xD;
"What, shy yet! By your leave, my dear !" said the&#xD;
Admiral, chucking his hand under Catherine's chin, and.&#xD;
raising her face. Poor Kate's face, as well as her hair and&#xD;
her dress, was stained with dust and tears and perspiration,&#xD;
and her featixres were pale and haggard with sorrow, anxiety&#xD;
and ex~rcme fatigue. The profligate dropped her chin with&#xD;
a start, as if it had burnt him, exclaiming-&#xD;
"Whisht! Ugh! Brownies and kelpies, and witches on&#xD;
broomsticks! Oh! ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Ugh! what a face!&#xD;
Here, Corporal, I pass her over to you; you seem to be kindly&#xD;
disposed. There is no accounting for tastes, so-Oh! ho,&#xD;
ho, ho, ho, ho! I make you a present of her. Oh-h!&#xD;
where can I find a dozen pretty girls to get the cross out of&#xD;
my eyes P'&#xD;
Mortified, repulsed, despairing, Catherine stood by her&#xD;
horse, with one arm thrown around his neck, and her head&#xD;
resting upon it.&#xD;
A low hum of voices around her, seemingly incident upon&#xD;
some one's arrival on the scene of action, and then a sweet,&#xD;
deep-toned voice near her, inquiring-&#xD;
"Can we be so happy as to serve you in any way, lady ~&#xD;
I should be most grateful for the opportunity. To be able&#xD;
to render any service is always a most soothing amelioration&#xD;
to me of the harsh duties of war."&#xD;
"Major-General Ross," whispered the friendly Corporal,&#xD;
stooping to her ear.&#xD;
Catherine raised her head, and sa~w,.~bending towards her,&#xD;
a very handsome man, in the early prime of life, of a grave,&#xD;
sweet, thoughtful, and somewhat melancholy expression' of&#xD;
countenance, who regarding her with respectful sympathy,&#xD;
repeated his offers of service, saying&#xD;
"If I ara so fortunate as to be abl~ to assist you, lady,&#xD;
pray do not hesitate a n~oment to cor~imand me."&#xD;
"Thank you, thank you-I-wisEed to speak with the&#xD;

"Speak with me, lady. I shall be most happy to aid you-.&#xD;
What is it ? Have you or yours suffered, or received any&#xD;
injury by our soldiers that I can redress?~ Can I help you&#xD;
in any way'?" asked General iRoss, In gentle, earnest tones-.&#xD;
" Yes, yes, I think you may have power to do me a vital&#xD;
service."~&#xD;
" Name it, lady. My word is pledged."&#xD;
" His word is pledged!- Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho !-pledged&#xD;
to a scare-crowr !-pledged to a kelpie !-pledged to a witch&#xD;
on a broomstick ! Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho ! Oh-h !" shouted&#xD;
the coarse Admiral-.&#xD;
The eye of Ross flashed for an instant, but sheathed its&#xD;
fire as he turned to Catherine, and, taking her hand respect-&#xD;
fully, drew her aside from the proximity of the brutal Cock-&#xD;
burn, who, in addition to his other graces, was now doubly&#xD;
inflamed by drink and triumph.&#xD;
" A tryste ! a tryste with the Queen of the Kelpies ! Oh,&#xD;
ho, ho, ho, ho, ho !" roared -the Admiral, holding his sides,&#xD;
and bending forward to shout his insulting laughter, and then&#xD;
stalking off." -'&#xD;
" Explain, lady. I shall be proud to serve you. Pray&#xD;
have confidence in me, madam,.and believe in the sincerity&#xD;
of my words," said General Ross, still holding her hand,&#xD;
while she passed her other one slowly to and fro across her&#xD;
forehead, as was hef- habit when embarrassed, trying to clear&#xD;
her mind and arrange her thoughts-.&#xD;
But as son as she was relieved from the presence of the&#xD;
coarse and insolent Cockburn, she recovered breath and self-,-&#xD;
possession, and spoke clearly and to the point.'&#xD;
" I thank you, sir.-J deeply thank you. I will tell you-.&#xD;
I heard, in my distant mountain home, that my husband,&#xD;
Major Clifton, of the  --Regiment of Volunteers, had&#xD;
been dangerously wounded in the action at St. Leonard's. I&#xD;
did not hear that he had also been taken prisoner. Believing&#xD;
him to be still in the American camp,- and fearing that he&#xD;
needed more constant attention than he could get,'"and feel-&#xD;
ing very anxious to hear directly from him, I sent his favorite&#xD;
servant to flnd him, directing the man to remain with him,&#xD;
* Words usedl by the generous and unfortunate General Ross, while&#xD;
trying to sothe the fears of Mrs. E--&#xD;
&#xD;
arid to write me of his state. lie, this servant, was a poor,&#xD;
rustic negro, sir, totally ignorant of the usages of war.&#xD;
When he reached the American camp, he discovered that his&#xD;
master was a prisoner on board the British fleet. He pro-.&#xD;
cured a boat and boarded the Albion. IHe was taken as a&#xD;
.spy, of course, and, to end the miserable story, awaits only&#xD;
the orders of 'Admiral Cockburn~to be executed. I heard&#xD;
that yesterday evening, and I instantly set off, and between .&#xD;
that hour and this have ridden more than seventy miles, al-&#xD;
most without stopping for food or rest, and entered the city&#xD;
to-night alone, when all were flying from it, to beg this man's&#xD;
life from the Admiral. Now, you know, you know, how vital&#xD;
is my request, my prayer."&#xD;
a"You could not have done more for your father, lady !"&#xD;
replied General Ross, with a gentle, earnest wonder -on his&#xD;
fine countenance. " You could not have done more for your&#xD;
father than you have done for this slave.'"&#xD;
" Do not wonder, sir. He would have laid down his life&#xD;
for us. But, oh, sir ! time presses-deaths threatens !"&#xD;
" Be at peace, ladyA The life or death of this slave, of&#xD;
such vital imipor'tance to you, is really a matter of so little&#xD;
moment to Admiral Cockburn, that I have not the slightest&#xD;
-hesitation in promising to secure for you ,jis pardon and&#xD;
.liberation."&#xD;
" Oh, may the Lord forever bless you, sir ! I never, never*&#xD;
can tell you how grateful I am-&#xD;
-" Peace, peace, dear lady. It is absolutely nothing. I&#xD;
would to Heaven I could really do anything to merit your&#xD;
kind word and kind remembrance, when others are cursing%&#xD;
.me for what the stern duties of war force me to do !"&#xD;
" I shall ever remember you, sir, with the deepest grati-&#xD;
tude."&#xD;
" And now, Mrs. Clifton, you must have rest and refresh-&#xD;
ment. My head-quarters are at IYoctor E---'s.    His&#xD;
amiable family are at home. They will gladly afford you&#xD;
comfort and assistance. Permit me to conduct you thither."&#xD;
He replaced her -carefully in her saddle, and taking the&#xD;
reins, led her horse 'until they reached the commodious man-.&#xD;
sion of Doctor E---. Here he introduced Mrs. Clifton,&#xD;
who was received with i'espect and sympathy. Leaving her&#xD;
in the care of the kind and hospitable family, he then set out&#xD;
to seek Admiral Cockburn.&#xD;

freshments of a partial bath and food. After which she lay~&#xD;
down on a sofa, to rest, and await the return of the gentle&#xD;
and generous Ross.&#xD;
In about half an hour she was summoned to the parlor,-&#xD;
where she found him standing. He advanced to meet her,&#xD;
and said-&#xD;
"Mrs. Clifton, I have the pardon here, but I very much&#xD;
fear-" and his face clouded over-" I very much fear it will&#xD;
be too late."&#xD;
"'Too late!"' echoed Catherine, sinking into a chair, as&#xD;
she repeated the saddest words in the language-" Too late.&#xD;
Is he dead ?" she asked, covering her face with her hands.&#xD;
"No, Mrs. Clifton, but he has been ordered for execution&#xD;
at eight o'clock to-morrow."&#xD;
"IT 15 NOT TOO LATE !" exclaimed Catherine, starting&#xD;
up, with electric energy. "Give me-oh! give me, the par-&#xD;
don !-I will take it there in time !"&#xD;
"Lady, the distance is over forty miles-and the necessary&#xD;
delays, and the dangers that threaten a young female, travel-&#xD;
ing alone by night, through a country infested-"&#xD;
"Oh! give me the pardon! give it me, I implore you!&#xD;
I will take it there safely, and in time! Heaven has pro~&#xD;
tested me through dangers as great, and -Hicaven will pro-&#xD;
tect me through these! Oh, for the love of Heaven, do not&#xD;
hesitate! Every moment is inestimable when a 'too late'&#xD;
threatens us! Give me the pardon !"&#xD;
Nay, lady, I can send a courier with the pardon, rather&#xD;
than that you should go, for many reasons."&#xD;
" Oh, no, no, your courier would want to stop, to eat and&#xD;
drink-or he might fall 'in with some of our people, and be&#xD;
killed or taken,-or if he escaped, through his explanation&#xD;
of his errand-.-why, that very errand would be rendered fu-&#xD;
tile, by the time lost in investigation. I shall pause for, no-&#xD;
thing. Heaven will protect and speed me. Oh! give me&#xD;
the pardon. Do not delay! .1111 depends upon promptitude.&#xD;
Alas! excuse my importunity! but give me the pardon !"&#xD;
General Ross attempted to dissuade her; but neither ar-&#xD;
guments nor persuasions had the least effect upon her resolu-&#xD;
tion. At last; overruled by her earnestness, vehemence and&#xD;
faith, he yielded-handed her the pardon, and went out to&#xD;
see if he could procure her a fresh horse.&#xD;
When he entered again, after a successful search, he found&#xD;
her equipped for her eecQfld night's journey, and standing in&#xD;
V&#xD;
&#xD;
the midst of her astonished hosts. He informed her that Iher&#xD;
horse was ready, and also that he had provided her a guard,&#xD;
to escort her beyond Bladensburg. Then she took a hasty&#xD;
and grateful leave of her amiable entertainers, and accept-&#xD;
ing the arm of the Major-General, left the' house.&#xD;
As General Ross placed her in the saddle, and handed her&#xD;
the reins, he said-&#xD;
"Heaven protect and speed you, lady. Farewell-and,&#xD;
sometimes remember me."&#xD;
"I will remember and pray for General Ross while I live,"&#xD;
said Catherine. And then she put whip to her horse, and&#xD;
rode away, upheld by a wonderful energy.&#xD;

He gently clears thy war,&#xD;
Trust thou his grace-so shall the night&#xD;
Soon end in joyous day.-MoRAvIAN.&#xD;
INCALCULABLE is the power of the spirit over the flesh.&#xD;
In the intense absorption of her soul by one hope, Catherine&#xD;
was carried above all consciousness of the excessive exertion,&#xD;
and all sense of the extreme fatigue that was oppressing and&#xD;
harassing her bodily powers almost to dissolution. But a&#xD;
watchful Providence, that had already thrice arrested her&#xD;
dreadful journey, now a fourth time interposed to compel her&#xD;
to rest. She had parted with her escort, when past the Brit-&#xD;
ish outposts, beyond Bladensburg. And by the time she&#xD;
had reached Long Old Fields, the storm, that had been&#xD;
threatening all the evening, burst suddenly, with terrible&#xD;
violence, driving her for shelter into a farm-house. And&#xD;
again, wondering and compassionate hosts persuaded her to&#xD;
lie down ~nd repose, and once more, as soon a~ her weary&#xD;
head dropped upon the pillow, deep sleep, like an irresistible&#xD;
mandate of the All Merciful, fell upon her, and, despite of&#xD;
pain of body and anguish of mind, she slept soundly foi~&#xD;
several hours ;-slept, as the prisoner sleeps the night before&#xD;
execution ;-slept, as the martyr sleeps in the- intervals of&#xD;
torture upon the rack ;-slept, while the tempest raged with&#xD;
awful fury ;-while the rain fell in torrents, and the wind&#xD;
rushed through the forest, carrying destruction on its wings;&#xD;
while gigantic trees were twisted off, or torn up by the&#xD;
roots, and great. rivers were swelled to floods ;-she slept the&#xD;
deep, dreamless sleep "God giveth His beloved." Probably&#xD;
to this Providential sleep she owcd the preservation of her&#xD;
life, for the spirit that qan goad the flesh to exertion unto&#xD;
death, cannot save it from dissolution.&#xD;

THE~ dJRSF. OF CLIFTON.&#xD;

&#xD;
When she awoke, the storm had passed, and the stars were&#xD;
shining dimly in the early dawn of day. She started up, re-&#xD;
morseful and aifrighted to find she had slept so long, and to&#xD;
recolleot that her journey was not half over. It was now&#xD;
four o'clock, and she had yet nearly thirty miles to ride be.&#xD;
fore eight, or all was lost! Her pitying hosts tried to per-&#xD;
suade her to wait and partake of their early breakfast, which,&#xD;
they said, would be ready in half an hour; but finding her&#xD;
bent upon setting forward, they hastily got some refreshment&#xD;
together, and permitted her to mount her horse and depart.&#xD;
But she had not proceeded many yards, before she found that&#xD;
the motion of her steed gave her great pain-pain so sharp,&#xD;
as to force itself to be felt through all her intense mental&#xD;
abstraction. She checked her horse's trot, and put him into&#xD;
a gallop, whose smooth, wavy motion, somewhat relieved her&#xD;
distress.&#xD;
The, morning was sparklingly brilliant after the storm; the&#xD;
forest trees and the grass were spangled by the rain-drops,&#xD;
and the slanting ray~ of the rising run striking deep into the&#xD;
foliage, flecked all its green leaves with golden light. Her&#xD;
horse was fresh, his blood was up, and on they sped like an&#xD;
arrow through the woods..&#xD;
Suddenly she stopped and reeled backwards-that sharp&#xD;
pain again; it pierced her side and chest like a sword; it&#xD;
caught away her breath, and caused the drops of perspiration&#xD;
to burst from her pale forehead. But not for pain, or even&#xD;
for the fear of death, must she pause. She might perish, bu~&#xD;
her purpose must first be accomplished, if possible.&#xD;
Bracing her nerves, and steeling her sul against the sense&#xD;
of suffering, she put whip to her horse, and flew on, as before&#xD;
the wind, leaving forest, meadow and hamlet-farm-house,&#xD;
field and flood, far behind her. A~ain and again the sharp&#xD;
agony arrested her, like the, hand of~aeath-but in .vain to&#xD;
stop her progress-each time the pang could only delay her a&#xD;
moment, and then on and on she sped, spurning the ground&#xD;
away in her desperate flight.&#xD;
Before her, in the distance, glimmered the blue Patuxent,&#xD;
the longed-for goaf. Oh! that river; for an hour past it&#xD;
ha~ seemed as near as.now. Would she ever approach it ~&#xD;
On and on she sped, while woods and towns and plains whirled&#xD;
behind her in a mad reel. A fearful change was coming over&#xD;
her. The sense of pain, with -all other sense, had gradually&#xD;
left her. A stupor of weariness supervened; her brain&#xD;

reeled; her sight failed. Oh! that river, how it gleamed&#xD;
and disappeared, and gleamed again before her. Would she&#xD;
ever, ever be nearer to it'? How dim the sunlight was, and&#xD;
how unsteady the ground; and the boundaries of the sky and&#xD;
earth were molten together and lost; and it was no longer&#xD;
the action of her horse, but the dreadful rocking and up..&#xD;
heaving of the ground, that kept her moving, moving, moving,&#xD;
forever. Oh! that river! hi~w it .glimmered and sparkled,&#xD;
and sparkled and flashed into her brain. Would she ever,&#xD;
ever, ever reach it, or was she going round in a circle forever'?'&#xD;
Reason was failing at last-past, present and future-things&#xD;
that were, and things that seemed, swam thickly together&#xD;
upon brain and heart; surely the hour of dissolution had&#xD;
come, for dense darkness and heaviness were settling like&#xD;
grave ~1ods upon brain and heart. Oh! God, that river !.-~&#xD;
had sh~ really reached it at last, or was it an illusion of do..&#xD;
hirium ~ Kilts waves rolled and flashed in silvery splendor at&#xD;
the foot of the hill, below her feet! But what was that'?&#xD;
Angels in Heaven! what was that'? A sight to call back&#xD;
ebbing life.4! Down in the dell, the glitterbof bayonets and&#xD;
the glow of scarlet coats-~-an open square of British infantry,&#xD;
enclosing an execution scene! Clutching the pardon from&#xD;
her bosom, and holding it aloft at arm's length, she roused&#xD;
her fast failing strength for a last effort, and hurled herself&#xD;
and steed furiously down the hill upon the scene of doom.&#xD;
The flash of steel around her-the gallows tree-the cart-&#xD;
the prisoner-the fatal noose-and more than ~all, close be..&#xD;
side her, the form of him-her own-her Clifton-madly&#xD;
loved in life and death, and then-darkness closed in upon&#xD;
her life, an~ all was lost.&#xD;
As the reins fell from powerless hands upon the horse's&#xD;
neck, the noble animal stood stock still; had he lifted a leg~&#xD;
it must have been fatal to the swooning rider; but he stood&#xD;
like a statue, while her form swayed to and fro for a moment,&#xD;
and then Archer Clifton .sprang forward and received her in&#xD;
~iis arms. He picked up the paper as it fell from her stiffen-&#xD;
ing       and guessing its purport, passed it to the officer&#xD;
in command. Then he sank upon one knee, drew her insc~-&#xD;
sible form to and supported it against his breast, while ~he&#xD;
untied her hat and loosened her spencer.&#xD;
A little bustle ensued around him; but he did not heed it,&#xD;
bending over Catherine. The execution was stayed, the pri-&#xD;
soner released, and poor Jack, half-dead 'with terror before,&#xD;

&#xD;
and half mad with joy now, had ~till strength and sense and&#xD;
affection~ enough left to run to a spring hard by, and dip up&#xD;
his hat full of water, and the next instant he was kneeling&#xD;
with it by the side of his mistress, to bathe her hands.&#xD;
"Who is she'?" "Where did she come from'?" "What&#xD;
is her name'?" "Who is the lady'?" "Do you know her,&#xD;
sir'?" asked some of' the officers, crowding around with offers&#xD;
of assistance.&#xD;
"This lady is my wife, gentlemen! Air! air, if you&#xD;
please !" exclaimed Archer Clifton, waving them off, and&#xD;
giving his sole attention to Catherine.. '~Kate !"&#xD;
The sound of that thrilling voice-the clasp of those thril-&#xD;
hug arms, had power to call back her spirit from the confines&#xD;
of the invisible world. Her pale, ~pale eyelids, quivered.&#xD;
* "Kate !" he exclaimed again, raising her higher upon his&#xD;
breast.&#xD;
A shuddering sigh convulsed her bosom-her languid eyes&#xD;
enclosed.&#xD;
"Kate !"&#xD;
"Yes, Kate!" she~ echoed, nodding her head with that&#xD;
quick, nervous, spasmodic gesture common to her.&#xD;
"And why have you done this thing'? Why have you&#xD;
placed yourself en scene like a third-rate opera dancer'?"&#xD;
She raised her fading eyes to his face, pleadingly, mur-&#xD;
inuring-&#xD;
"Your wishes-the reprieve !"&#xD;
"Well, what of that'?" Was there no one to bring it&#xD;
but yourself'?"&#xD;
Too feeble to enter upon the long explanation required,&#xD;
she only shook her head, murmuring at intervals-&#xD;
"Forgive-forgive-I could not see him die. Patience,&#xD;
patience-indeed, I will not trouble~' you, love,-T will go&#xD;
away again, far away! Maybe God willet me die !"&#xD;
The last words were breathed forth in a long, deep sigh,&#xD;
and she sank away again into insensibility.&#xD;
Poor Jack, kneeling by her side, bathed her hand with the&#xD;
water he had brought, and with his tears that fell like rain.&#xD;
Major Clifton laid her head down upon the green sward,&#xD;
and using to his feet, addressed the officer in comiwrnd,&#xD;
saying-&#xD;
"Sir, I am a prisoner of war, as you know. Yet, my wife&#xD;
is in a~ dying state here, and I wish to convey her to a place'&#xD;
of safety and repose."&#xD;

" Major'Clifton will consider himself on his parole, and&#xD;
command any assistance we may be able to render him or his&#xD;
heroic wife," said Captain -, at the same time showing&#xD;
him a note from General Ross to that effect, which had been&#xD;
folded in with th~e pardon.&#xD;
"I think, sir," added the officer, " that there is a farm-&#xD;
house near here, belonging to a planter of the name of&#xD;
Greenfield, where your lady would be hospitably received,&#xD;
and well taken .care of; perhaps you had better send your&#xD;
servant thither to boi-row a carriage." .&#xD;
Thanking the officer for his civility and good advice, Major&#xD;
Clifton immediately acted upon it by dispatching Jack to the&#xD;
house, while he himself supported Catherine until the arrival&#xD;
of the carriage. He then placed her in it, and she was&#xD;
driven slowly to " Greenwood." Here -she was kindly re-&#xD;
ceived by the planter's wife- and sisters, who tenderly un-&#xD;
dressed her and put her to bed. A physician was summoned,&#xD;
who, when he arrived and looked at her and felt her pulse,&#xD;
and heard the circumstances, pronounced her insensibility to&#xD;
be not a swoon, but a trance-coma-the result of excessive&#xD;
fatigue of mind and body. He said that such stupors, if&#xD;
prematurely broken, might end in convulsions and mad-&#xD;
ness-or if' left, too, to themselves,, might terminate in&#xD;
death ; that her state was exceedingly critical, and that her&#xD;
rest was by no means to be broken, unless there was a per-&#xD;
ceptible failure in her pulse, in which case the stimulants&#xD;
and restorative he should leave must be applied and admin-&#xD;
istered, and -himself instantly summoned. And so he left&#xD;
her.&#xD;
Hiavin'gseen Catherine thus at rest, and having received&#xD;
many assurances from her gentle-hearted hostess that every&#xD;
care and; attention should be given her, Major Clifton took&#xD;
leave, and returned to render himself up to his captors, who&#xD;
were just about to return to their ship. .He went with them.&#xD;
And when they had arrived-on board ,the Albion, an agree- -&#xD;
able surprise awaited him. A gentleman in the uniform of&#xD;
an 'American general stood upon the deck, attended by a flag&#xD;
of truce, and Major Clifton immediately recognized Colonel&#xD;
(now General) 'Conyers, who instantly advancedset  hm,&#xD;
and shaking hands heartily, exclaimed-       methm&#xD;
" You did .not expect to find me here?~ I have come&#xD;

which you fell into the hands of the enemy, is now offered in&#xD;

"Yes, si, said Captain -   , advancing towar-ds them,&#xD;
"and I am exceedingly happy to say that an exchange has&#xD;
-been effected, and to Kongratulate you on your restoration to&#xD;
liberty."&#xD;
Major Clifton bowed deeply, and requested the use of a&#xD;
boat to leave the ship.&#xD;
" Nay-yourself and General Conyers will stay and dine-&#xD;
with us ?" asked Captain.&#xD;
But Major Clifton, thanking him for his invitation, and&#xD;
also for much kindness and attention received during his so-&#xD;
journ as a captive %among them, declined remaining longer,&#xD;
and repeated his request for a boat.&#xD;
"Oh, mine is here at your service. I am going ashore&#xD;
with yous of course," said General Conyers.&#xD;
" I beg your pardon, sir ! the boat you came in has been&#xD;
taken by Captain Fairfax, who has gone ashore with it."&#xD;
" Ah, true!"&#xD;
" Captain Fairfax ?" asked Archer Clifton.&#xD;
a"Yes, my friend, Captain Fairfax. Frank accompanied&#xD;
me hither in search of yourself. Some news .pf vital import-&#xD;
ance he had to communicate, which he did not impart to me.&#xD;
lie could not wait for your return at all, so he went ashore&#xD;
in search of you. lie would have found you sooner if he&#xD;
had waited here, which proves the truth of the old proverb-&#xD;
'Most haste, least speed."&#xD;
" The boat is manned, sir," said a lieutenant to Major&#xD;
Clifton.&#xD;
General Conyers and himself then took leave of the Brit-&#xD;
ish officers, entered the bo-at, and were rowed swiftly to the&#xD;
land.- As soon as they hadl stepped, upon the beach, and&#xD;
found themselves alone, Conyers -grasped the hand of Clifton,&#xD;
and shaking it cordially, said-&#xD;
" So, you have won noble Catherine ? Well, I congratu-&#xD;
late you with a whole heart, though you have won her from&#xD;
my hopes."&#xD;
" Won her from your hopes ?i"&#xD;
" Ay, Arche I loved her."&#xD;
"Loved her? "&#xD;
"Yes4and love her !"&#xD;
"Lve her ?"&#xD;

&#xD;
"Yes, and shall always love her, highly and purely though,&#xD;
as a saint loves an angel."&#xD;
"You'astonish me !"&#xD;
J' And I' shall astonish you more, perhaps. Three several&#xD;
times in one year I wooed her, and three several times was&#xD;
my suit rejected by her."&#xD;
"J*say you astound me! Your suit rejected by Catherine ~&#xD;
Yours? Can this be possible ~"&#xD;
"Possible as that I was nearly driven to despair by her&#xD;
rejection."&#xD;
Major Clifton threw his hand to his brow and gazed at the.&#xD;
speaker in amazement, while he compared the claims of Gene-&#xD;
ral Conyers with his own. General Conyers, with his haughty&#xD;
and powerful connection in town and country; his immense&#xD;
unincumbered estates; his high jnilitary rank; and last, not&#xD;
least, his eminently handsome person, accomplished mind,&#xD;
and graceful 'address ;-General Conyers, in every social,&#xD;
official, and personal dignity, highly superior. And himself,&#xD;
with his limited circle; his debt-encumbered property; his&#xD;
medium post in the army; and his very moderate share of&#xD;
personal attraction, and he exclaimed again-.&#xD;
"Catherine reject you ?"&#xD;
"Three distinct times, most firmly."&#xD;
"Why, upon what possible pretext could she have done&#xD;
so ~"&#xD;
"Ay, ~sure enough! Upon what possible pretext 'f"&#xD;
smiled General Couyers, ruefully. "Upon the plea that she&#xD;
did not love me, save only 'as a sister or a spirit might.' I&#xD;
'won her respect, esteem, 'friendship, all but her love! She&#xD;
was a fraiik, high-winded, pure hearted girl. She gave me&#xD;
"the ~greatest proof of confidence she could possibly. give, and&#xD;
at the. same instant struck the only death-blow to dangerous.&#xD;
'hopes that she could possibly strike, she told 'me that she&#xD;
could never be ~more than a4aithful fri&#xD;

"And who did 'she say Was that other ~"&#xD;
"Nay, she never breathed his name. She could not have&#xD;
done that. She was trying to do me good when she infori~ed&#xD;

At first she flushed and paled, hesitating between generous&#xD;

THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.&#xD;
&#xD;
impulse and womanly~reserve; and then as principle rose&#xD;
above instinct, her face glowed with an expression such as I&#xD;
have seen in the pictures of St. Agnes ;-a warm,'high, holy&#xD;
look, an inspired look, such as might well become the coun-&#xD;
tenance of the Virgin Martyr, and she said, speaking to her-&#xD;
self, 'There is no good reason why I should not reveal any&#xD;
secret of my heart, if the revelation can help any other soul&#xD;
to tranquillity and strength.' Tl~en to me-' Listen: Yout&#xD;
are not the only sorely disappointed one. Who,' indeed, is&#xD;
joyous that is past childhood ~ I, tao, have missed life's&#xD;
crowning joy-the love of one I love. But what then ~ If&#xD;
we cannot have joy in this life of probation, there yet re-&#xD;
mains duty, and the peace its performance yields ; 'and friends,&#xD;
and the cheerfulness their society gives; and God, and the&#xD;
divine comfort His service brings.'"&#xD;
"She said that ~ She said that ~" groaned Clifton.&#xD;
"Yes. You seem strongly moved, Archer V'&#xD;
"I 'am! I am! You do uot know with how much reason!&#xD;
But go on! Tell me n~ore of her."&#xD;
"She never breathed the name of him she loved to my&#xD;
ear, yet I knew her Whole secret. I had suspected it months&#xD;
before. Shall I tell you why ~"&#xD;
"Yes! Goon!"&#xD;
"It was at the Governor's levee, where I was first intro-&#xD;
duced to her, and where you met after a long absence; I was&#xD;
present at the casual meeting. I~beheld the strong emotion&#xD;
that she could not conceal. Some hours after that I was&#xD;
near her, when unobserved by all except myself, and uncon-&#xD;
scious of my presence also, she 4Shanced to witness the&#xD;
reconciliation between yourself and your chosen bride. I&#xD;
saw her face grow paler than death, aRd then the meek head&#xD;
bow in submission, and the iricek hands fold as in prayer,&#xD;
and the meek voice murmur low and fervently, 'Thank God!&#xD;
Oh! God help me tp say that sincerely.' I had been in-&#xD;
terested in her before; 'but I saw that, and I loved her from&#xD;
that'hour, the' sweet, the lovely, the Madonna-like maiden!&#xD;
I loved her with an affection as free from passion as it was&#xD;
from selfishness, and as free from both as 'her own pure,&#xD;
saintly nature. And I offered her my heart and hand, asI said.&#xD;
And she sweetly and 'gratefully declined them, as I might&#xD;
have known before ;--unveiling the sanctuary of her price-&#xD;
less heart, to quiet me forever with the revelation of another&#xD;
master there."&#xD;

* "Oh, God! Oh, God !" said Clifton.&#xD;
"What disturbs you so, Archer ?"&#xD;
"Nevey mind! Never mind! And so, rejecting you as&#xD;
a lover, she won you as a friend ?"&#xD;
"For life and death and eternity. Yes."&#xD;
"That was a triumph! Rejected lovers seldom become&#xD;
friends! That was a rare triumph! IBut then Catherin~ is&#xD;
a rare woman.. -&#xD;
"Very rare!"&#xD;
, ,,&#xD;
"Truly n~ k-named 'Maria Theresa.&#xD;
"Catheri ' 'Maria Theresa?' By whom? By some&#xD;
one, I suppose, who, recognizing her strong, practical mind,&#xD;
~ees nothing better in her nature-sees not the pure heart&#xD;
and the lofty spirit of infinitely higher value than that."&#xD;
"Heaven bless you, .Conyers, for your good opinion of&#xD;
Catherjne. But I wish to put a case to you, only an imagi-&#xD;
nary case, you observe, Conyers ?"&#xD;
"Yes! Well?"&#xD;
"Suppose you had married Catherine ?"&#xD;
"That is very imaginary! Well ?"&#xD;
"And suppose that you had discovered her to be unwor-&#xD;
thy of your good opinion ?"&#xD;
"Impossible! It could not have happened, because she&#xD;
could' not have been unwoxthy."&#xD;
"But suppose that her unworthiness had been made mani-&#xD;
fest to you beyond all chance of mistake or doubt ?"&#xD;
"11-n it! Don't let me be profane. It couldn't have&#xD;
been made manifest to me, I tell you~ Could any person or&#xD;
anything1demonstrate to me that the sun darkened the earth,&#xD;
or ~he clouds dropped powdered charcoal, or that fig trees&#xD;
bore thorns? There are some things that can't be proved,&#xD;
because they can't exist !"&#xD;
~Major Clifton thrust his hand in his boso~n, and drew&#xD;
thence a letter in &amp;amp; gray envelope, and handing it to General&#xD;
Conyers, asked- -&#xD;
"Do yQn-know that hand-writing ?"&#xD;
* "Certainly, I do.'~&#xD;
"Who8e is it3"&#xD;
"Mr~. Catherine Clifton's."&#xD;
"Are you sure ?"&#xD;
"Pooh! Of course I am! I am familiar with the wri~&#xD;
~ting!"&#xD;
"Could you swear to it ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"You arc very emphatic in this matter! Let me see tho&#xD;
letter again. Yes, I could swear to it."&#xD;
"And now will you do me the favor to read it !"&#xD;
General Conyers, with some hesitation, began to read, but&#xD;
before getting half through, the blood rushed to his brow,&#xD;
and crushing the letter in his hand, he hurled it beneath his*&#xD;
feet, and setting his heel upon it, ground it into the earth.&#xD;
"What do you think of it, now ?" asked Clifton, bitterly.&#xD;
"Think of it !-it is an infernal forgery! If any man had&#xD;
brought me that letter, and said that Catherine wrote it,&#xD;
I should have treated it just as I have done now, to show my&#xD;
.contempt for the forgery; and then I should have raised it&#xD;
with my sword's point, and thrust it down his throat, to cx-&#xD;
press my loathing of the forger or the accomplice."&#xD;
"And yet, just now you could have sworn to the hand-&#xD;
writing."&#xD;
"]~eath! Yes! And for which presumption I earnestly&#xD;
beg ~onr pardon, Clifton !"&#xD;
"And now you are quite as much convinced that she did&#xD;
not write it. How can you explain 1~his ?"&#xD;
"Why, simply thus-that the whole of Catherine's noble&#xD;
life is a refutation of the'siander contained in that letter. Sir!&#xD;
it is a d-d forgery! Look at 'it! See how easy the hand&#xD;
is imitated! Give me a pen and ink, and' though I have not&#xD;
much talent for imitation, I will produce you a fac simile of&#xD;
Catherine's hand-writing. 'I reject, I beg your forgiveness&#xD;
for saying that that was Catherine's. I said so, because it&#xD;
strongly resembled hers, and I did not know the vile pur-&#xD;
port! Oh, I trust, Clifton, 'that you signally punished the&#xD;
conspirator who wrote it! I can well believe thai you nei~&#xD;
ther eat, slept, said your' prayers, ~vent to church ~r into her&#xD;
presence, until you had pursued the forger, and punished him&#xD;
or her to the utmost extent of the Ia~!"&#xD;

without replying, conducted his companion into the 'house,&#xD;
and introduced him to ~he planter's f~iaily~ On inquiry con-&#xD;
cerning"the state 4 Catherine, he 'learned that sh~ stiW ~lay&#xD;

shaken Clifton's firm convictions of her guilt to their uproot~&#xD;
ings, as the whirlwind shakes the oak. Ay, and he was&#xD;
shaken-literally shaken, terribly shaken, by strong passion,&#xD;
as he exclaimed to himself-&#xD;
"Oh, would to Heaven 'I could think as he does! I am&#xD;
no longer a youth, credulous of happiness, but if I could only&#xD;
thoroughly believe in Kate, as he does-or once see her inno-&#xD;
cerice proved, it would fill my heart with joy." He entered&#xD;
the charnb4r, and Went up to her bedside. There was a pallor&#xD;
spread like death over her brow. CC But she was ~always so&#xD;
pale," he said, in a voice tremulous with tenderness. So&#xD;
still she lay, so profound was her repose, that her breathing&#xD;
could not be seen or heard, until, alarmed, he stooped ancP&#xD;
listened, and perceived that her respiration was deep, soft,&#xD;
slow and regular. Her sleep was evidently necessary, health-&#xD;
ful and recuperative. He stood and gazed at her sculptured,&#xD;
marble-like face, as her head reposed upon the pillow. He&#xD;
had fever seen that noble countenance in the deep repose of&#xD;
sleep before. No, and waking, it had always been disturbed&#xD;
by care, or grief, or anxiety, or bashfulness. Now the noble&#xD;
face was in perfect rest. The majesty of truth sat enthroned&#xD;
* upon the fine, broad, open forehead, with its eyebrows arched&#xD;
far apart, and more elevated, because the eyelids were shut&#xD;
down, wrth their~ dark lashes lying long and still upon the&#xD;
pale cheeks. And the beauty of goodness lay folded in every&#xD;
curve of the lightly-closed and perfect lips. She looked a&#xD;
queen in repose-&#xD;
"A Queen ot'noble Nature's cipwnino~"&#xD;
whom it were disloyalty to~ suspect, and treason to accuse.&#xD;
A~ ~je gazed, the earnest faith of Conyers came back with&#xD;
t~*iYold power to his soul. He more than half abjured his&#xD;
Te~il convictions, and a flood of tenderness came over his&#xD;
heart. There was no one to see his weakness-not even&#xD;
her-.the sleeper. lie went and closed the door, and re-&#xD;
turned and lcneeled b her side. He took her hand, and&#xD;
bowed his head over ii From that trance-'sleep there was&#xD;
no fear, because there was no possibility of Waking her yet.&#xD;
lie jdssed and pressed that hand with sorrowful passion-&#xD;
murmuring-" For once-for this time, I will, I will believe&#xD;
you true, my own dear Catherine. My whole nature starves;&#xD;
it starves, and withers, and dies for a perfect reconcilia-&#xD;

of evil, and fold you around with my love, and press you to&#xD;
this still denied and hungering, perishing heart." And he&#xD;
raised her in his arms, and folded her to his bosom, pressing&#xD;
an ardent kiss upon her lips. That passionate kiss sent an.&#xD;
electric shock through all her still life. A shnddering sigh&#xD;
shook her bosom; her lips parted in a light, rosy smile;&#xD;
color dawned upon her cheeks, and light beamed on her&#xD;
brow. Alarmed, and remembering i~he physician's warning&#xD;
that a premature awakening might be fatal, he ettutiously&#xD;
laid her down again, and anxiously watched her eotmtenan&amp;amp;e.&#xD;
* She did not awake; nor ~did the light depart from her brow;&#xD;
nor the color from her cheeks; nor the smile from her lips.&#xD;
"flow she loves rue. Her soul as~well as her person is mine..&#xD;
How she loves me, even in sleep-~-even in this trance-sleep,&#xD;
with all her senses locked. How she loves me-my Kate!&#xD;

like years, has aged! My own "&#xD;
A light step upon the stairs, and a rap at the door, and&#xD;
he hastened to open it. It was the farmer's little niece,&#xD;
Susannah, who came to say that Captain Fairfax was in the&#xD;
parlor, waiting to see Major Clifton. He~ turned back an&#xD;
instant, to arrange the coverlet, gave a last glance at the&#xD;
beloved face, and then followed the child, down stairs. The&#xD;
staircase led directly down into the parlor, and as soon as he&#xD;
had reached it, he saw Frank Fairfax, who immediately&#xD;
hastened to meet hiin~, and-&#xD;
"My dear Frank !"&#xD;
"My dearest CliI'ton !"&#xD;
Were the words of affectionate greeting interchanged,, as&#xD;
they shook hands.&#xD;
"Well, and so you have been married these ~wo years&#xD;
nearly, and I have never had the opportunity of congratu-&#xD;

If you had only waited two years longer, until I had some-&#xD;

"When, and where, and under what circumstances, did&#xD;

" She died a week since, at her house, in Richmond."&#xD;
"I am very sorry. The cause of her death?"&#xD;
"One of those virulent summer fevers prevalent in the city&#xD;
just at this season. Her physicians think that hers was fa-&#xD;
tally aggravated by the life of excitement she ~had led, and by&#xD;
the friction of something that preyed upon her mind."&#xD;
Frank paused, and Major Clifton kept his eyes fixed with&#xD;
interest' upon his countenance. Frank sighed, and resumed-&#xD;
"A few days before her death, she sent for me.. I went,&#xD;
and found her laboring ulider great mental distress. She&#xD;
seemed half disposed to make me a confidant'; but after much&#xD;
painful hesitation, she reserved her secret, whatever it may&#xD;
have been, and drew from beneath her pillow this letter,&#xD;
which she gave me-exacting an oath, that after her death, and&#xD;
not before-I would hand it to you with the seal unbroken.&#xD;
She said that the whole future happiness of yourself and your&#xD;
wife, was concerned in your receiving it. And then, with&#xD;
many sighs and groans-for her eyes' seemed too dry for&#xD;
tears-she let me depart.. I never , saw her again. A few&#xD;
days after that, I heard she was dead."&#xD;
"The letter ?~~you seem very much agitated, Clifton !"&#xD;
"Here it 'is.&#xD;
"With reason9! Give it me&#xD;
And receiving the letter, Major Clifton hastened to the.&#xD;
opposite end pf the ri~om and began to read it. It was ;the&#xD;
confession of a guilty and dying wemnan. She wrote, that on&#xD;
~ the borders of eternity there was no false seeming~ and no&#xD;
false shame-that all human feelings were lost in remorse, in&#xD;
terror, and in awe. Then she confessed her mad and guilty&#xD;
passion for himself, and all the crimes into' which it had&#xD;
te~npted~her; ~the slanders that had separated him and his&#xD;
cousin Carolyn~the forged letter 'that had brought such&#xD;
bitter sorrow to himself and Catherine. All was confessed&#xD;
and~deplored. Finally she supplicatedd his forgiveness, as he&#xD;
hoped to be.forgiven of God.&#xD;

"I cannot, Frank! Dear Frank, Icannot. The memory&#xD;
of the 'dead shouldd be sacred; so should the differences&#xD;
Qf-~-. I cannot tell you, Frank."&#xD;
&#xD;
"Hist! Here's the doctor."&#xD;
Old Doctor Shaw at this moment passed through the par-&#xD;
br, on his way to visit his patient.&#xD;
Major Clifton accompanied him up stairs to her chamber.&#xD;
When they reached her bed-chamber, he noticed that the&#xD;
~rnfle had departed from her lips, and the color from her,,&#xD;
cheeks. The old physician put on his spectacles, and looked&#xD;
scrutinizingly at her face and hands, laid his hand upon her&#xD;
forehead and bosom, to get the temperature, felt her pulse,&#xD;
felt her hands said feet, and finally pronounced her to be&#xD;
doing very well.&#xD;
"May she not be wakened up, sir '~" asked Clifton, almost&#xD;
selfish in his impatience for a reconciliation.&#xD;
"By no means. She must be let alone-nature is her&#xD;
best physician, and the sleep she prescribes, her best medi-&#xD;
mue.&#xD;
"But, sir, I have something of vital importance to com-&#xD;
'municate to her !" persisted Clifton.&#xD;
"Sir, it may be of vital importance to you, but it would&#xD;
be of fatal importance to her, should you rouse her to com-&#xD;
municate it, whatever it is."&#xD;
Major Clifton was obliged to restrain his eagOrness. The&#xD;
physician departed, leaving only one simple direction :-that,&#xD;
as soon as she awoke she should be put in a '~varm bath.&#xD;
Archer Clifton was then summoned down stairs to join the&#xD;
family at supper. There he found ajively,' witty, eccentric&#xD;
personage, who was introduced to him as "Our neighbor,&#xD;
Mr. Perry." And when the ~'evenin~ was over, this gentle-&#xD;
man to~k an opportunity of drawing the officers aside, and&#xD;
confidentially informing them that the ladies of Greenwood&#xD;
were very much crowded with the company of some relatl6us&#xD;
that were staying with them just 'then, and that although they&#xD;
would certainly press their guests to remain all nightt' the&#xD;
latter could not do so without putting their kind h6stess to&#xD;
much inconvenience; he concluded ~by offering, and heartily&#xD;
pressing upon the gentlemen the accomniodations of his own&#xD;
house. Thanking Mr. Perry for his kindness, they accepted&#xD;
his profferediio5pita~itYand prepared to accompany him home.&#xD;
~Major Clifton went up st~irs,~ intending only to press a&#xD;
patting kiss upon the lips of his now doubly beloved Cathe-&#xD;
rine, but when he reached her chamber, he seemed to forget&#xD;
every thing but her, and sat down by her bed~id~, watching&#xD;
the sweet, pale, majestiO countenance in ite death;like repose.&#xD;

TIIE confidential communication made by Mr. Perry, was&#xD;
probably a ruse on the part of that eccentric gentleman, for&#xD;
the purpose of obtaining . the assistance of the officers in&#xD;
"making a~ night of it" over at his-house. Certainly, on&#xD;
reaching the home of their host, they found company await-&#xD;
ing their arrival, and they passed the evening in the jolly&#xD;
festivity of country hos~itahity. A luxurious supper was&#xD;
served late at night, from which they did not separate until&#xD;
the ~ small hours." Thus many of the g~i'ests overslept&#xD;
themselves the next morning, which delayed the family break-&#xD;
fast several hours. Therefore it was after ten o'clock, before&#xD;
Major Clifton,~er~r much against the will of his odd enter-&#xD;
tainer, bid him farewell, and set out to return to G~reenwood.&#xD;
It was eleven o'clock when he reached the farm-house. The&#xD;
ladies were all in their sitting-room, engaged in their various&#xD;
domestic occupations of netting, sewing, knitting, etc.,&#xD;
when he entered, and gave them the morning salutation.&#xD;
And then-&#xD;
"How is Mrs. Clifton this morning, ladies? Can 1 see&#xD;
her immediately ?"&#xD;
"Mrs. Olifton, sir !" said the eldest lady, looking up in&#xD;
surpi'ise. "Mrs. Clifton is gone, sir. Did you not know it ~"&#xD;
&#xD;
THE CURSE OF CLIFTON.            235&#xD;
"Gone 'i" repeated Archer Clifton, incredulously.&#xD;
"Yes, sir."&#xD;
"Gone!" he reiterated, in amazement.&#xD;
"Yes, sir. We certainly thought that you were aware&#xD;
of her departure."&#xD;
"Most certainly not! Gone! When? how? excuse me,&#xD;
madam, but where has she gone ?"&#xD;
"We do not know, sir, indeed, since you cannot tell us.&#xD;
We thought that she had gone to join you, at Mr. Perry's.&#xD;
We were very sorry, but-"&#xD;
"How long since she left? How did she go? Pardon my&#xD;
vehemence, dear madam."&#xD;
"We partake of your anxiety, sir. Mrs. Clifton left us&#xD;
about four hours since, at seven o'clock, immediately after&#xD;
breakfast. She went away on the horse that was brought&#xD;
here yesterday as her own. She left us very much against&#xD;
our arguments and persuasions. - We would gladly have de-&#xD;
tained her."&#xD;
"Gone! Good Heavens, was she able to go."&#xD;
"No, sir, assuredly she was not."&#xD;
Archer Clifton sank into a chair, exclaiming-&#xD;
"Pray, tell me, dear madam, the circumstances of this&#xD;
departure, and all that occurred from the time I left, until&#xD;
she went away.&#xD;
"Why, sir, after you left, she continued in the same deep&#xD;
sleep until nearly nine o'clock~ when she. began to 8how&#xD;
symptoms of awakening. I sent out and ordered the hot&#xD;
bath to be prepared, and ~at down to watch her. As she&#xD;
drew near to consciOusness, her face lost that look of pro-&#xD;
found repose, which had previously marked it, and began to&#xD;
assume an expression of suffering. Her brows folded, and&#xD;
her lips sprang apart and quivered7as with a spasm of sharp&#xD;
pain, and her eyes flared open suddenlff, and she was~awake,&#xD;
I asked her how she felt, but she shook her head, and closed&#xD;
her eyes again, and shut her teeth tightly, like one trying to&#xD;
bear silently some sharp, inward pain. The bath was. then&#xD;
prepared by the bedside, ~nd we began to get her rea4y for&#xD;
it'; but on the slightest attempt to move her, she groaned&#xD;
so deeply, that we scarcely dared to lift her for some minutes,&#xD;
I knew then how it wae ;-that her. muscles were stiff and&#xD;
painful, from the severe exertion of such a long equestrian&#xD;
journey. And I knew also. thiit the hot bath would relieve&#xD;
her;. and the doctor's directions had been peremptory, so we&#xD;

tried again, and placed her in the bath. And very soon the&#xD;
*          - hot water seemed to alleviate her sufferings. And when we&#xD;
- ,         put her comfortably to bed again, she thanked us very&#xD;
sweetly. I asked her how she found herself. She answered,&#xD;
'Better'-adding, that she thought, by her hard exercise,&#xD;
*           she had hurt some part of her chest or side, which had -given&#xD;
her great pain, but which was now partially relieved."&#xD;
"Did she seem very much better ~ Was her voice strong&#xD;
in speaking V'&#xD;
as "No, it was very weak and faint, and frequently broken,&#xD;
by some inward pain, as I said." /&#xD;
"Go on, dear lady.".&#xD;
"We brought her a cup of tea and a plate of toast; of&#xD;
both of which she partook slightly. It was then after nine&#xD;
o'clock, and she begged that she might not disturb us-that&#xD;
we would retire to bed-and said that she was better, and&#xD;
would try to sleep again. She then composed herself to rest,&#xD;
and the girls all left the room. I remained watching until&#xD;
I thought she slept, and then I lay down to rest on the other&#xD;
bed in the same room., I think she passed a good night, for&#xD;
I oculd not divest myself of uneasiness upon her account, and&#xD;
so I could not get to sleep until after midnight, and during&#xD;
all that time I never heard her move, or sigh. After I did&#xD;
*           get to sleep, however, I slept very soixndly, till near six&#xD;
o'clock. And when I awoke, what was my surprise, to see&#xD;
her up and dressed, as for a 'journey. She looked very pale&#xD;
and ill and -sorrowful, and in fastening her habit, she fre..&#xD;
quently stopped and leaned against the bed-post for support.&#xD;
I atose sicklyy and questioned her wishes, and begged her&#xD;
'to lie down again. But she only waved h~r hand against&#xD;
me, with a mute, imploring gesture. I expostulated with&#xD;
her, but arguments and persuasions 'were alike in vain-she&#xD;
only. answered~, -' I must go."'&#xD;
-" Oh, Heaven!- -Where, where did she wish to go ?"&#xD;
"We do not know. She was not communicative, and we&#xD;
did not like to question her."&#xD;
"Forgive' me, dear madam. Indeed I fear my question-&#xD;
ings must appear almost rude, but my great anxiety must be&#xD;
my excuse."                  -         -&#xD;
"Y6ur anxiety is very na~ aral, sir, and we share it." -&#xD;
"Did she know that I was in the neighborhood ~ Did any&#xD;
one inform her ?"&#xD;
"We cannot tell whether she knew of your presence here.&#xD;
&#xD;
We did not tell her, for, as I said, she made no inquiries,&#xD;
and there was a reserve about her despair that~shut itself in&#xD;
from all interference. Indeed it would be scarcely doing&#xD;
justice to her look of deep sorrow, to say that she was the&#xD;
most hopeless looking human being I ever s~w in my life.&#xD;
She seemed like one who had seen her last hope go down."&#xD;
"Merciful God !"&#xD;
"We used every method, except force, to prevent her&#xD;
leaving us, though we were impressed with the idea that she&#xD;
was going to you. And after her departure, in. consulting&#xD;
together, we were half sorry that-we had not essayed gentle&#xD;
coercion, for we all suspected that the lady's reason was&#xD;
clouded."&#xD;
"Great God! I have driven her to madness-perhaps to&#xD;
death !" thought Archer Clifton, but then he exerted self"&#xD;
control enough -to conceal the depths and extent of his&#xD;
anxiety, and asked "What road did she take ~'"&#xD;
"The North-west road, sir, which branches off towards&#xD;
Mr. Perry's a quarter of a mile up, which was one of our&#xD;
reasons for supposing that she had gone to join you.&#xD;
Taking a hasty leave of the family, Major Clifton remounted&#xD;
his horse, and rode furiously up the road, meeting General&#xD;
Conyers and Frank, who had lagged behind Qfl their return&#xD;
home. Stopping them, he communicated what had happened,&#xD;
but concealed his worst fears, and merely said that he pre-&#xD;
sumed that Catherine had left for her Virginia home, in igno-&#xD;
rance of his liberation, and his presence in the, neighborhood,&#xD;
and that he wished, if possible, to -overtake her, before she&#xD;
had proceeded far upon her road. Frank immediately turned&#xD;
rein to accompany him, wlAle General Covyers, with many&#xD;
expressions of regret and concern, -took leave of them, to&#xD;
return to Greenwood, and explain th~ir absence.&#xD;
The road lay for many miles through a dense forest, and&#xD;
they galloped onward for hours without meeting a single&#xD;
traveler or seeing a solitary house. Near the, Qutsklrts of&#xD;
the forest they came upon a party of stragglers, whom they&#xD;
judged to be deserter~ from the British army. IBut these&#xD;
men, when questioned, gave cautious and unsatisfactory an~&#xD;
swers-sulkily- insisting that no lady riding alone had passed&#xD;
that way. They next' inquired of- some field laborers, who&#xD;
were stacking grain a- little- farther on. They replied that a&#xD;
lady in a dark riding-dress, riding on a bay horse, had&#xD;
passed that way about two hours before, but~not alone; a&#xD;

boy, mounted on a white mare, attended her. Perhaps this&#xD;
was Catherine, and her attendant some chance passenger.&#xD;
*They questioned more particularly, and the description given&#xD;
'answQred to her personal appearance. They asked what road&#xD;
she had taken, and being told "straight ahead," they set off&#xD;
in a gallop.. A few miles further on they again inquired,&#xD;
and were told that such a lady, attended by a boy, had passed&#xD;
about an hour before. Full of hope, they put spurs to their&#xD;
horses .and hurried on, congratulating tliemselve&#xD;
were gaining on her' so fast.              s that they&#xD;
At length they reacdThd a school-house in the woods,&#xD;
where, tied to a fence, they saw the bay horse, with a side-&#xD;
saddle, and a white pony, with a boy's saddle. iDisniobnting&#xD;
quickly, Captain Fairfax hastened to the school-room door,&#xD;
and inquired of the master to whom the animal belonged ~&#xD;
"To Mrs. Jones, who has just brought her son to school,"&#xD;
answered the teacher, full of surprise at the question.&#xD;
And there indeed, sat "Mrs. Jones" and young Hopeful,&#xD;
looking as they considered, such investigation into their&#xD;
property ye impertinent, to say the least.&#xD;
Disappoint d, Frank returned to Major Clifton with this&#xD;
explanation, a d they looked at each other. in chagrin and&#xD;
perplexity-.M jor Clifton with great difficulty maintaining&#xD;
his self-posses ion, and concealing the dreadful forebodings&#xD;
that 'ovarshad' wed his mind. They were no~v thirty miles&#xD;
from Greenwo d, and the ~sun was getting low.&#xD;
"I do no see anything better t~ do~ Archer, than to&#xD;
keep on w each Washington City. No doubt you will&#xD;
sep r t~iere, if you do not overtake her before."&#xD;
A am' putting whip to their horses, tl~y galloped on,&#xD;
passin the great belt of forest, and entering upon the bare&#xD;
'lowlands, ~ng south of the city. It was late in the night&#xD;
when they descended the road leading to the Anacostic&#xD;
bridge. They found that the bridge had been 'destroyed,&#xD;
and they expertenced~ much difficulty and delay before find-&#xD;
ing a. boat ~to take them across. They entered the ruined&#xD;
and blackened city a little after midnight.. At that hour&#xD;
little opportunity of search was afforded, aud that little wa~&#xD;
fruitless.. They 'ha4 much 'trouble in finding ,a night's&#xD;
lodging in the desolate city, but at length obtained indiffer-&#xD;
ent shelter,' and retired, with the determination to pursue&#xD;
their~ investigations in the morning. At an early 'hour they&#xD;
aros~, and wezit~ out, making inquiries. in every direction, ibut&#xD;
&#xD;
in vain. 'No one had seen or heard of the missing lady,&#xD;
though many cheerfully suggested that she had fallen into&#xD;
the hands of the British soldiery, who were on their retteat&#xD;
through the low counties. Strongly impressed with the idea&#xD;
'that she must be in or near Washington, they were unwilling&#xD;
to abandon their search, but remained in the city all day, and&#xD;
through the next night, before resigning all hope of finding&#xD;
her there. Even upon the second morning, Major Clifton&#xD;
and Captain Fairfax were divided in their opinion as 'to&#xD;
whether they had better go back to St. Mary's, or' go on&#xD;
to IR . Major Clifton, full of the darkest presenti-&#xD;
ments, was disposed to turn back. Captain Fairfax, on the -&#xD;
contrary, full of hope and confidence, urged his. friend to&#xD;
p'ush forward. While they were 'debating, General Conyers&#xD;
rode up and joined thorn. He said he had but that morning&#xD;
reached the city, and had been an hour in search of them.&#xD;
In answer to their anxious questions, General Conyers in-&#xD;
formed them that up to late the night before, no news had&#xD;
been heard of Mrs. Clifton~that she evidently was not in the&#xD;
neighborhood he had just left. He seemed grieved and'&#xD;
alarmed to find that they had not yet overtaken Catherine,&#xD;
but expressed a strong conviction' that she must be on her&#xD;
way home. He advised them 'to pursue the~journey, and&#xD;
regretting. that peremptory duty called him to an interview&#xD;
with the Secretary of War, and prevented his bearing the~ni&#xD;
company, took leave, and rode away-turning'back once to&#xD;
beg that as soon as they had found' Catherine, they would&#xD;
Write to him at Washington, and let him know. Major Clif'~&#xD;
ton and Frank procured fresh horses, and leaving their own,&#xD;
set forward on their anxious jofrrney.&#xD;
The gloomiest forebodings darkened the mind of Archer&#xD;
Clifton. There was one scene ~eve(present to his mental&#xD;
vision-where, at the end of her 'dreadful journey, fainting&#xD;
from incredible exertion,- Catherine 'had' fallen into his arms,&#xD;
and he had received her with a harsh and stei~n'rebuke' for&#xD;
making a scene :-6ne look and tone of hers, that 'filled his&#xD;
soul with' remorse and terror prophetic of doom-her last de-&#xD;
spairing ga~i~-.her list despairim~g tones, befor&amp;amp;' she sank&#xD;
into insensibility. How plaintively 'they echoed throtigh 'his&#xD;
heart-" Patience, ~patience, patience-Klndeed 'I 'will&#xD;

will let me die." Would he ever forget those words, that&#xD;

h-ear&amp;amp;fronl. their mistress since -shaleft to go to Washington.&#xD;

tion, Major Clifton - sent her off -nns~tisffed,- -and turned an -&#xD;
agonized look upon Frank. -- Fairf~x wa~ almost discouraged,&#xD;

mnexits for his guest, and soon after attended him to his room,&#xD;
and retired to his own, not to rest, but to walk about dis-&#xD;
tractedly, and then he burst into Catherine's vacant chamber,&#xD;
and threw himself down upon her empty ibed, in the very&#xD;
anguish of bereavement. His long residence in the lowlands&#xD;
of the Chesapeake, during the hot stunmer months, had pre-&#xD;
disposed him to- illness. His long journey, under the burning&#xD;
sun of August by day, and heavy dews of August by night,&#xD;
fatigue and anxiety, loss of food and sleep, all conspired to&#xD;
bring on the pernicious fever, and before moriling Archer&#xD;
Clifton was tossing and raving in high delirium. Summoned&#xD;
by the alarmed servants, Captain Fairfax waS early at his&#xD;
bedside, and seeing his condition, dispatched a messenger&#xD;
for the, family physician. For many days, his state alternated&#xD;
between delirium and stupor, and his life tottered upon the&#xD;
edge of the grave. And in his delirium all his raving was&#xD;
of Catherine-still Catherine-now adjuring her as his&#xD;
Nemesis-.-now wooing her by the most tender epithets of af-&#xD;
fection-calling her his "poor wouu~led dove,'Miis "broken-&#xD;
hearted child," etc. Often he repeated plaintively her last&#xD;
sorrowful , hopeless words.&#xD;
At length the crisis of the disease came. The delirium&#xD;
arose to frenzy. His spirit, as well- as his~fiesh, seemed to&#xD;
be passing through the very fires of purgatory. lie raved&#xD;
incessazitly-now of Carolyn, now of Georgia, then of his&#xD;
mother, and always of Catherine-sometimes calling down&#xD;
the bitterest imprecations up~n his own head, sometimes&#xD;
severely reproaching Georgia, sometimes pleading his cause&#xD;
with his mother, and always breaking off to soothe and coax&#xD;
Catherine, as if she were circled in his arm.&#xD;
At length the frenzy fairly exhausted itself, and he sank&#xD;
into a comatose state, to drea4u of~ Catherine, tG see- visions&#xD;
of Catherine, to feel her gentle pre~enoe, and healing~minis-&#xD;
trations all abouthim. Then came ins~ensibility~which-lastad,&#xD;
he did riot Ipiow how long, for all sense of time and place,&#xD;
and exist0nce itself was blotted out..&#xD;
And at last he awoke-the burning fever had gone. out&#xD;
from- his. blood, anid~ a delicious coolness ran through air his&#xD;
v6in~-.~-the terrible nervous excitement ~had subsided, -~ud. a&#xD;
luxurious calm lay upon mind and body, until memory came&#xD;
to disturb it, perbapato torture it. Ha- was experiencing the&#xD;
delightful sensations of restoration and convalescence, and&#xD;
his Physical stato alone, would have been sufficient cause for&#xD;

happiness, but for one aching, aching spot, one sharp'point&#xD;
ofagony- as it were in his heart's core. And when~ the cry&#xD;
in his bosom found its corresponding expression, the word&#xD;
was" Catherine!" "Catherine!"&#xD;
his, eyes had opened on his darkened chamber, where,&#xD;
upon the hearth, gilinmered a feeble taper, that scarce~ sent&#xD;
its weak rays beyond the edges of the hearth. lie knew it&#xD;
must be near day, for the low, melodious detonating sounds&#xD;
of early morning were echoing through the mountains. The&#xD;
chamber seemed deserted-not if Catherine had been living&#xD;
Would his sick bed have been so abandoned, he thought. J1e,&#xD;
turned and groaned from the depths of his bosom-" Oh,&#xD;
Catherine ! Catherine." His room was very dusky-lie&#xD;
could not see the presence by his couch-but now gentler&#xD;
than "tired -eyelids upon tired eyes" fell a soft hand upon&#xD;
his brow.&#xD;
Surely there was but one touch like that in the world!&#xD;
A- new born, feeble hope was trembling at his heart, a&#xD;
hope that he feared to aisturb lest it should die in dist~p-&#xD;
pointment ;- that he dared scarcely submit to the t6st of oer~&#xD;
tainty, lest that certainty should bring not- joy but despair.&#xD;
At last, trembling with doubt, he murmured, "Am I dream-&#xD;
ing, or,-dear-Kate, are you here'?"&#xD;
"I am here," she answered softly.&#xD;
" Darling, are you well'?"&#xD;
"Very well-but yow are not well enough to talk yet,"&#xD;
said Kate, gently.&#xD;
"Dear Kate-how long have-you been home'?"&#xD;
"Since tj~e day you were taken ill," replied Kate, at the&#xD;
same -tim~ ~cirding his shoulders with one arn~, and raising&#xD;
him, while with the other hand she placed a glass to his lips.&#xD;
Whether the medicine were a potent sedative,-~or whether&#xD;
heiKgentler touch had a soothing effect; or whether both these&#xD;
influences acted upon him, I cannot tell~; but certainly the&#xD;
nervous ~zcitement, just, raised by the discovery of her pre-&#xD;
senOe, subsided into perfect calmness, and he lay with his&#xD;
hand f~idedin-C&amp;amp;therine's, until he fell asleep.&#xD;
-When he awoke again it was sunrise, and his room looked&#xD;
cheerful, and the family physician and Frank Fairfax sto6d&#xD;
a1~ his bedside, with their. congratulations on his convale-&#xD;
~c~nee. And while they staid, his --eyes were toying rest-&#xD;
lessly around the room, in search of some one else.&#xD;
And when they went- away, Catherine entered, bringing&#xD;

cold water, and came and~ sponged his head and hands. And&#xD;
then she went out, and 'returned with his. light breakfast.&#xD;
She sat upon the bed, supporting his head and shoulders&#xD;
upon her bosom, while he ate. At last-~.&#xD;
"Take it all away, clearest KatQ," he said, "and sit where&#xD;
I can see you. It is you who are my -restorative."&#xD;
When the ser~/ice was removed, and his pillows were ar-&#xD;
ranged, and he was comfortably laid back upou them again,&#xD;
he said..-.&#xD;
"Dearest Kate, do you know that I know at last, how&#xD;
deeply you have been injured'?" -&#xD;
She stooped down to him saying, softly..-.-&#xD;
"Please do not try to talk to-day. Yield to the inclina-&#xD;
tion you have for sleep. It is so needful to you, and will&#xD;
prove so restorative. And to-morrow, when you are better,&#xD;
W9 can converse." -&#xD;
He, smiled upon her, and laid his hand in hers, and while&#xD;
she clasped it, fell asleep.&#xD;
With a strong constitution lik4 t'hat of Archer Cljfton, the&#xD;
convalescence is rapid. And C~itherine's presence, as he&#xD;
said, was his true restorative.&#xD;

and reclined comfortably upon his couch watching Catherine,&#xD;
who moved quietly about the 'room setting things in- order.&#xD;
He was much wasted by illness, and his face looked still&#xD;
more sallow and haggard for the dark, dishevelled hair and&#xD;
whiskers that encircled it; but his countenance wore an cx-&#xD;
pression of subdued joy as he lay and watched Kate. At&#xD;
last-&#xD;
&#xD;
"Are you so much afraid that il-enny will disturb me~ by&#xD;
rattling a cup and saucer, or jingling a teaspoon,- that - you&#xD;
must do -all yourself '?- My devoted Kate, I am not so -ill.&#xD;
Come and sit upon the' lounge by~me, and let me talk' -to&#xD;
you;" he said, holding out hi~ arms.&#xD;
- She went and sat upon the side of the couch, and' he en-&#xD;
circled her with his-arm, while he said-&#xD;
"My dear Kate, - do you know that I thought I had lost&#xD;
you'?"&#xD;
She raised her- eyes. in gentle wonder~&#xD;
"Yes, I thought your great and undeserved' inisfortune&amp;amp;&#xD;
had- killed or maddened you."&#xD;
"It was the approach of your illness that gave you such&#xD;
dreadful thoughts," said Catherine, gently. - -&#xD;

"Yes, and with such a look of hopeless resignation! I&#xD;

upon her stronger -than ever.&#xD;

"You said, Mrs. Georgia.~~&#xD;
"Yes. It was strange you fiever suspected that, Kate ."&#xD;
"I did suspect it."&#xD;
"You did suspect it !" exclaimed Archer Clifton, in sur-&#xD;
prise..&#xD;
"And you never breathed that suspicion !"&#xD;
No, because I had no certain evidence against her. It&#xD;
would have been wrong to have acted upon a mere suspicion."&#xD;
"Just and upright in all things 1"..&#xD;
"I only believed God's promises. I left my cause to&#xD;
Heaven.&#xD;

gave point to my own sorrow. .&#xD;

thing-1 sometimes saw.~-oh, I used to watch you so closely,&#xD;
because I could not help it, Kate ;-when I was harsh and&#xD;
stern, I sometimes saw your chin ~quiver-like a grieved&#xD;
child's-and, Kate, my whole soul would be overflowed ~with&#xD;
tenderness, which, ~ conceal, I' had to start up and leave the&#xD;
room, with every appearance of 'anger that I could falsely&#xD;
assume."'&#xD;
Kat~ wept-her tears fell fast upon his hand, that she had&#xD;
clasped between her own.&#xD;
"And, oh, Catherine, to think that all this trouble I have&#xD;
suffered, and have inflicted upon you, should have been so&#xD;
unnecessary !"&#xD;
,Catherine slid from the edge of the couch down upon her&#xD;
l~nees beside it, and her countenance grew earnest, and in-&#xD;
spired with faith and love, as she clasped her hands, and&#xD;
said-.-.&#xD;
"Oh, no! it was not ' cessary. 'God suffered it to be,&#xD;
and it was well-very . 'All things work together ~for&#xD;
good, to them that 1, ";the Lord.' And every pang that&#xD;

Again in ~the full' tide of her earnest thoughts, the' old&#xD;
'l~ashfulness flushed her cheek, and silenced her tongue. She&#xD;
wished'to say,~~ Because I think you would never have known&#xD;
me so well, or held me so dear, if you had not proved me by&#xD;
fiery trial."&#xD;
And agd~n his heart rightly interpreted her silence, and he&#xD;
answered her unuttered thought by saying-.'&#xD;
"Yes, you are right, my' own dear blessing! You are&#xD;
fright, for I never should have known your full value but for&#xD;
t~he trial you have passed through. ' Yet not now only, but&#xD;

I denied it to others.-but there it was, the perfect, vital&#xD;

FRANCIS LORD JEFFREY.&#xD;
In One Volume See., with es' Portrait.&#xD;
From a very able article in the North&#xD;
British Review we extract the following:&#xD;
"It is a book not to be read only-but&#xD;
studied-it is a vast repository; or rather&#xD;
a system or institute, embracing the whole&#xD;
circle of letters-if we except the exact&#xD;
sciences-and contains within itself; notin&#xD;
a desnitory form, but in a welt digested~&#xD;
scheme, more original conceptions, bold&#xD;
and fearless speculation and just reasoning&#xD;
on all kinds and varieties of subjects than&#xD;
are to be found in any English writer with&#xD;
whom we are acquainted within the pre-&#xD;
sent or the last generation. * * His&#xD;
choice of words is unbounded and his feli-&#xD;
city of expression, to the most impalpable&#xD;
shade of djscriiliinatio!b almost miraculous.&#xD;
Playful , lively, and full of illustration, no&#xD;
subject ,isso dull or so dry that he cannot&#xD;
iiivest it with interest, and none so trifling~&#xD;
that it cannot acquire dignity or elegance&#xD;
from his pencil. Independently however,&#xD;
of mere style, and apart from the great&#xD;
variety of subjects embraced bY his pen,&#xD;
the distinguishing feature of his writings,&#xD;
and that in which he' excelaihis cotempo-&#xD;
rary reviewers, is the deep vein of practical&#xD;
nioughit which runs throughout them all"&#xD;
