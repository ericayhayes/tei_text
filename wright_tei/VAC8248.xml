CHAPTER        I.&#xD;
IN the north-western part of the State of North Carolina,&#xD;
upon the head-waters of the River Yadkin, a stream somewhat&#xD;
noted in our revolutionary annals for scenes of partisan war-&#xD;
fare, and, near the little town of Hillsborough, a place of no&#xD;
great note at the present day, but during the last quarter of&#xD;
the eighteenth century, when our story commences, rendered&#xD;
quite famous (at least in the estimation of its inhabitants):&#xD;
as having been the head-quarters of General Cornwallis for a&#xD;
short period, just after the celebrated retreat of General Greene&#xD;
across the Dan into Virginia, was a small, unpretending farm-&#xD;
house; and around it, what would now be considered a very&#xD;
unthrifty and badly cultivated farm.&#xD;
To this farm-house, a little after nightfall, on a raw, chilly&#xD;
day in the month of March, early in the last phase of the&#xD;
eighteenth century, and to a little party of five persons&#xD;
gathered around its ample fireside, we would ixow draw the&#xD;
attention of the reader.&#xD;
But, before we enter into 1, more particular and minute&#xD;
description of this little company at the farn4house, that the&#xD;
reader may more readily comprehend the thread of our story&#xD;

&#xD;
and the peculiar situation of our country, at the time of which&#xD;
we are speaking, it will be necessary to premise that the pre-&#xD;
sent narrative commences at a period only a few years subs Y&#xD;
quent to the- War of the Revolution.&#xD;
Neglected in their infancy by their mother country, and at&#xD;
a later day oppressed with unjust taxation, the colonies had,&#xD;
at length, been unwillingly forced into open rebellion. The&#xD;
result of this struggle, after many years of weary war, was a&#xD;
complete triumph on the part of our forefathers. It had been&#xD;
no emeute, or popular tumult flashing up, and passing away in&#xD;
an hour, but a fixed and steady resistance upon principle; and&#xD;
the end was the. acknowledgment of our nationality by all the&#xD;
civilized nations of the earth !&#xD;
No period in the history of the world has been more event-&#xD;
ful than the last quarter of th  ghteenth century; and no&#xD;
space of time, of the same dura on, more fruitful of wars and&#xD;
revolutions. The Eastern and Western Continents had alike&#xD;
been the scene of violent popular agitation; but the results of&#xD;
the sanguinary conflicts upon the two hemispheres were vastly&#xD;
different. In the one, as we have already intimated, the result,&#xD;
was a complete triumph on the part of the colonies, and that&#xD;
tridinh had ushered into existence a Republic. The dream of&#xD;
the oet and philosopher had, at length, beedealized. In the&#xD;
olethere-had .been the same ardent desire to throw off the&#xD;
galling yoke of tyranny, and the same anxious longing after&#xD;
freedom., Taking root in France, the spirit of liberty, after&#xD;
sweeping the Bon of St. Louis from his throne to the grave,&#xD;
had, with unequalled rapidity, spread thence throughout Eu-&#xD;
rope, :}convulsing with war and revolutionary agitation all its&#xD;
nations, from the sunny shores of the Adriatic even to the&#xD;
wild:steppes of Russia. But the end of this mighty political&#xD;
throe was'defeat.. The ancient and' moss-covered institutions&#xD;
of feudalism and kingly prerogative had been violently shaken,&#xD;
it is true, but they were not destroyed. Those who would be.&#xD;
free, were bondsmen still.-&#xD;
Those were sad and bloody times, and times of startlipg&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.                5&#xD;
confusion throughout the kingdoms of the earth. The mind,&#xD;
when dwelling upon this age of the world, is ever peopled, like&#xD;
the misty songs of Ossian, with shadowy warriors, and shields,&#xD;
and banners, and broken spears; and, whilst lingering upon&#xD;
the tossing panorama, would fain turn away to contemplate&#xD;
the beneficial effects, if any, of 0so much blood and suffering,&#xD;
and of such unusual disorder in the affairs of men.&#xD;
But, happily, our story commences just after the War of&#xD;
Independence, when the Western World rested from strife, and&#xD;
our Republic, fully established, and in successful operation,&#xD;
stood out before the astonished gaze of men the most memora-&#xD;
ble triumph of this memorable age.&#xD;
Forgetting the dark days of the Revolution, and enjoying&#xD;
with increased zest, after so many years of tumult and danger,&#xD;
the quiet pleasures of peace, our fathers, with smiling faces,&#xD;
gathered around their warm hearthstones, and dreamed of a&#xD;
glorious future. But their dreams respecting the future great-&#xD;
ness of their country, although bright, and beautiful, and flat-&#xD;
tering in their eyes, never for.a moment reached.that point of&#xD;
power and glory that we, their children of the present age, are&#xD;
permitted to enjoy and behold. The boundless valley of the&#xD;
Mississippi, and the great States now spread over the alluvial&#xD;
plains of the West, had no place in their pleasant fireside.fan-&#xD;
cies. The thirteen old States, binding, upon the shores of the&#xD;
Atlantic, the common offspring of our Puritan andCdatholic&#xD;
ancestors, and late the scene of war and desolation, alone filled&#xD;
their teeming minds, and Were alone the subject of their future&#xD;
hopes and expectations.&#xD;
At this pleasant epoch, then, in the history of our country,&#xD;
when America, or, rather, the eastern shores of eur Republic,&#xD;
rested from war; and when the roll of artillery, the partial&#xD;
tones of trumpet and drum, the quaking tramp of galloping&#xD;
squadrons, and light tread of the eager partisan were alike&#xD;
unknown and unheard, we commence our story.&#xD;
~The farm upon the Yadkin, as we have already stately, was&#xD;
~nunpretending one, and greatly out of repair;j and the farm-&#xD;

&#xD;
house looked very time-worn and dilapidated, although it was&#xD;
still comfortable and pleasant enough, when compared with the&#xD;
ordinary run of houses met with at that day, so soon after the&#xD;
hurry and confusion of a revolution. Luxuries were not so&#xD;
cheap and abundant then as now, and order and cleanliness not&#xD;
so much expected as at an age of more ease and leisure. It&#xD;
had been the home of Sergeant Duffe, this house and farm,&#xD;
during the entire war, and, indeed, for many years previous;&#xD;
and to this fact might be ascribed, more than to carelessness,&#xD;
intentional -neglect, or idleness, its present ruined condition.&#xD;
But although the Sergeant had been an active patriot from the'&#xD;
very commencement of our colonial struggles, and Tory depre-&#xD;
dations had been nowhere more frequent than upon the waters&#xD;
of the Yadkin, his residence had had the good luck during the&#xD;
whole of this time to escape untouched, and almost unvisited by&#xD;
any of their roving bands. Whether he owed his good luck to&#xD;
chance, or the kindness of his marauding neighbors, or to the&#xD;
secret and retired situation of the homestead, is a question of&#xD;
doubt to this day; but the Sergeant himself was in the habit&#xD;
of ascribing precious little of goodness or charity to the Tories,&#xD;
and, we doubt not, would have much. rather had it burned&#xD;
down than believe he owed its safety to any kindness of the&#xD;
enemy.&#xD;
Then around the fireside of the Sergeant, on a cold, raw night&#xD;
in March, were assembled five persons, a female and four males,&#xD;
three of the latter white, and the remaining one an African.&#xD;
The female -was the wife of Duffe, the owner of the mansion-&#xD;
and a hale, hearty dame, one of your buxom, stirring women&#xD;
was the good wife of the Sergeant-and comely, too, for one of&#xD;
her age, somewhere between thirty and thirty-five-and at that&#xD;
moment, "when we introduce her to the reader, she was busily&#xD;
and faithfully engaged, and apparently with no small under-&#xD;
standing, from the way she handled her foot, in doing what, in&#xD;
the times of Homer and Virgil, was considered very respectable&#xD;
and becoming (believe it, 0 modern belles!): to wit, twirling the&#xD;
reel, and making most excellent flax thread, such as is generally&#xD;
&#xD;

used nowadays, if, we are not mistaken (for we never speak posi-&#xD;
tively in doubtful cases), in sewing tow linen galligaskins.&#xD;
Such were the presence and figure of the good dame of the&#xD;
Sergeant, and such her employment; and, though surrounded by&#xD;
none of the luxuries and appliances of wealth-and there was&#xD;
neither piano, lute, nor harp to be seen anywhere in her neigh-&#xD;
borhood-yet there beat, beneath her coarse homespun dress,&#xD;
as kind, and gentle, and good a heart as ever throbbed or&#xD;
fluttered beneath the gaudy folds of the Persian loom.&#xD;
The Sergeant, a tall, athletic, and rawboned man, was, in&#xD;
appearance, well worthy of the -lassie he called his good lady,&#xD;
and seated, as he then was, bolt upright in his chair, as if upon&#xD;
dress-parade, looked even more gigantic than ,he really was;&#xD;
showing high above the back of his seat a pair of broad&#xD;
shoulders, and yet above these a stout determined neck,&#xD;
surmounted by a well-shaped head, profusely covered with a&#xD;
heavy shock of hair, auburn we'll call it, though, if speaking&#xD;
of a passing stranger, and not writing a novel, we should&#xD;
think it very nigh akin to what is vulgarly called a sandyy&#xD;
red."  Duffe, or the Sergeant, as we shall indifferently call&#xD;
him throughout our story, although not very prepossessing&#xD;
externally-for he would have stood a very bad chance for pre-&#xD;
ferment at the court of that beauty-loving virgin queen, Eli-&#xD;
zabeth-was, in every respect, a man, and as brave a one as&#xD;
ever buckled on harness to fight the enemies of his country;&#xD;
and, like all truly brave men, was-as generous, and noble, and&#xD;
kind-hearted as the most chivalrous knight of the crusading&#xD;
age! In a word, it might be said of him, and we doubt not&#xD;
. with as much, if not more truth, than was once said of a fa-&#xD;
mous chevalier, "1he was sans peur et sans reproche;" and, if&#xD;
his beauty would not have been a passport to the good graces&#xD;
of Queen Bess, his length would have raised him very high in&#xD;
the estimation of that lover of tall men, Frederick William, of&#xD;
Prussia!I&#xD;
By the side of the Sergeant sat a stout, powerfully framed,&#xD;
and wild-Ilooking being, whose visage, though none of the&#xD;

whitest (for it was very unfashionably sunburnt), betokened&#xD;
an Anglo-Saxon; whilst his dress and equipments went far to&#xD;
proclaim him a savage; and, had it not been for his language&#xD;
(though none of the purest), it would have been somewhat&#xD;
difficult to settle upon his race ! In a court of justice, espe-&#xD;
cially in the-South, where color is considered prima face evi-&#xD;
dence of slavery, we wouldn't'have given much for his chance&#xD;
of freedom. Simon Kenton, or Sharp-Eye, for such were the&#xD;
titles given him by his parents, and by his border companions,'&#xD;
and he answered readily to them both, in his dress and appear-&#xD;
ance; presented a striking picture of the daring half savage&#xD;
characters everywhere to be found at that day (and, indeed, at&#xD;
the present time) upon our extreme western frontier. A con-&#xD;
temporary of Boone, and one of the most skilful and deter-&#xD;
mined scouts of Kentucky, or the "Cane-Land," as it was&#xD;
then sometimes called, Kenton's dress, composed of a flowing&#xD;
hunting-shirt of tanned buckskin, with pants, or rather leg-&#xD;
gins, of the same material--a broad belt, buckled tight around&#xD;
his waist, supporting a tomahawk and hunting-knife--a gay&#xD;
pair of worked moccasons, with a capacious shot-pouch swung&#xD;
around his neck and ornamented with long tufts of black hair,&#xD;
resembling very much, as in truth they were, the scalp-locks&#xD;
of the western Indian, gave him a decidedly savage appearance,&#xD;
and declared at once his very recent return from a dangerous&#xD;
life upon the frontier. He had been a fellow-soldier of Duffe&#xD;
during the Revolution; but, after the war, being of an adven-&#xD;
turous and daring disposition, had wandered out West, where&#xD;
he had already become famous in the many bloody border&#xD;
frays between the savage and. early settler, and was considered&#xD;
second, in skill and cool bravery, to no scout of the "Dark and&#xD;
Bloody Ground." On a visit now to the Old States, as they were&#xD;
called at that period to distinguish them from the more recent&#xD;
settlements in the West, Kenton was sojourning, for the time,&#xD;
with his-old friend and companion in arms, not without a hope&#xD;
that, by his glowing descriptions of the flowing savannas be-&#xD;
yond the Blue Ridge, and of the wild freedom of a frontier life,'&#xD;
&#xD;
' OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.9&#xD;
he night induce the latter to bear him company upon his re-&#xD;
turn to Kentucky. Six feet two inches in his moccasons, with&#xD;
a well-knit sinewy frame to match his great height, and with a&#xD;
broad, full, and open face, tanned and swarthy, it is true, yet&#xD;
pleasant and bright, with a quit, good-humored smile; and&#xD;
lighted up by a deep-blue eye, and with heavy masses of auburn&#xD;
hair, and whiskers sweeping carelessly around and about his.&#xD;
countenance, Kenton exhibited in his person, as he sat before&#xD;
the fire Pf the Sergeant, a splendid specimen of the genuine&#xD;
borderer, and no wonder the Indian brave trembled at the re-&#xD;
doubted name of Sharp-Eye, and instinctively shrank from a&#xD;
contest with so formidable a foe. Although, now surrounded&#xD;
by friends, and in the house of an old comrade, the Scout, as&#xD;
was natural with him from long custom, still held grasped in&#xD;
his ready hand the barrel of his trusty rifle, from which he&#xD;
never parted, not even when he slept, and, at the same time,&#xD;
kept his ears wide awake to all suspicious sounds, as if yet in&#xD;
the land of the enemy, and momentarily expecting the wild&#xD;
yell of his accustomed foe. Notwithstanding he was well&#xD;
skilled in every species of woodcraft, an adept at following the&#xD;
trail of the wild beasts of the forest, and familiar with all the&#xD;
cunning tricks of the wily savage; yet, strange as it may&#xD;
appear, he was the most credulous of men, and as simple as a&#xD;
child in what is generally termed the wayss of the world," or,&#xD;
in other words, the tortuous winding of policy and hypocrisy,&#xD;
so often met with under the garb of civilization. Indeed, it&#xD;
has been said of him "that his confidence in man, and his&#xD;
credulity were such that the same man might cheat him twenty&#xD;
times; and, if he professed friendship, he might cheat him&#xD;
still !" At the feet of the Scout lay the inseparable com-&#xD;
panion of all his journeyings, his dog; and Bang, for such&#xD;
was the name of this prime favorite, was 'as rough a specimen&#xD;
of the canine species as his master's countenance was of the&#xD;
face divine! But Bang was, nevertheless, a very kAwing dog,&#xD;
and, ever and anon, now as his 'master became excited in his&#xD;
descriptions of western scenes and adventures, he woul4, aise&#xD;

&#xD;
his headband look intelligently at the narrator, and so wisely&#xD;
. did he wag his shaggy tail, that more than once the Warm-&#xD;
hearted hunter, breaking off suddenly in his narrative, would&#xD;
pat his trusty comrade upon the head, and swear, with a hearty&#xD;
emphasis, "that Bang knew all about it !"&#xD;
Eyeing with a suspicious glance, and some degree of super-&#xD;
stitious fear, this rough companion of the frontiersman, his&#xD;
uneasiness and private views respecting the genealogy of poor&#xD;
Bang by no means diminished by the Scout's frequent appeals&#xD;
to that worthy, the honest African, who rejoiced in the ancient-&#xD;
and honorable title of Titus, was an earnest, and, to judge by&#xD;
the staring iensity of his starting orbs, a most curious and&#xD;
interested listener to the wild stories of the borderer. He was&#xD;
an Ethiopian of pure blood,-if we take as evidence those very&#xD;
distinctive marks of color, nose, lips, and woolly head; and the&#xD;
latter, now slightly covered with gray, told that he was beyond&#xD;
the meridian of life; and his beauty (if ever blessed with that&#xD;
rare and much-coveted commodity) was now grievously dis-&#xD;
figured by a. deep scar, the effect of a sword-cut across his&#xD;
cheek ! Titus was a character in his way, as much so as the&#xD;
borderer, and had witnessed many bloody scenes, and passed&#xD;
through many perils during the Revolution. He had been&#xD;
the body-servant of a colonel in the Continental line, and had&#xD;
stood boldly and fearlessly by the side of his master in many&#xD;
a hard-fought field! The ghastly scar across his cheek was&#xD;
received on the sad field of Camden, whilst gallantly warding&#xD;
off a blow intended for .his already wounded master! The&#xD;
colonel was saved by the devotion of his slave, and Titus never&#xD;
had cause to regret the blow, : for that livid scar upon his sable&#xD;
countenance not only insured him the protection and affection&#xD;
of his grateful master during life, but, since his death, was a&#xD;
certain passport to the hearts of Kenton, Duffe, and the only&#xD;
son of the colonel, whom we will presently introduce to the&#xD;
reatler. Had the Scout been speaking now of regular warfare,&#xD;
the black, who prided himself upon his military knowledge&#xD;
and the service he had seen, would have exhibited all the stoic&#xD;
&#xD;
indifference of a veteran; but, as he was detailing hairbreadth&#xD;
escapes from the wily savage, and fierce border skirmishes in&#xD;
the "Dark and Bloody Ground," Titus, much to the delight of&#xD;
the borderer, had shown a proper degree of interest, and had,&#xD;
therefore (as all good listeners will), risen immeasurably in the&#xD;
estimation of the narrator, who promised himself to give the&#xD;
black an account of still more wonderful adventures, at some&#xD;
future day, when no one was present to keep him within the&#xD;
bounds of truth or reason.&#xD;
Lolling negligently in an arm-chair, a little removed from&#xD;
the personages we have just described, with his head thrown&#xD;
carelessly back, and his cap drawn closely over his eyes, re-&#xD;
clined a graceful youth of some two-and-twenty summers, and,&#xD;
from his dress and general appearance (the one being of much&#xD;
finer material, and the other exhibiting the ease and polish of&#xD;
education and an intimacy with refined society), bearing but&#xD;
little affinity to through beings with whom he was keeping&#xD;
company. Thiis youth was Bryan Head, an orphan-the son&#xD;
of the Sergeant's and Scout's colonel during the Revolution,&#xD;
and of Titus's - master !-but lately escaped from the control&#xD;
of his guardian, having received into his own hands the small&#xD;
patrimony left from the estate of his father, after defraying&#xD;
the expenses of his education. Bryan had been now for some:&#xD;
months enjoying his liberty; during that time, hunting in the&#xD;
neighborhood, and lodging at the humble farm-house of his&#xD;
foster-father, Duffe! ~The latter regarded Bryan with all the&#xD;
affection of a real parent, and the young man fully returned&#xD;
his love, regarding him in the light of a second-father i   And&#xD;
the good dame, who had nursed him after the death of his own&#xD;
mother, was not forgotten by.the grateful orphan, for she re-&#xD;
ceived from him all that love and reverence which would have&#xD;
been bestowed upon his own parent, had she been alive ! But&#xD;
the young man seemed but little interested in the bold sketches&#xD;
of the Scout, or rather appeared to be under some stronger&#xD;
influence than that excited by the stirring narrative of the bor-&#xD;
~derer; for, although Simon' s voice was none of the softest, and&#xD;

SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
had that deep guttural intonation so common with the western&#xD;
-savage, it apparently did not reach his ear, since he continued&#xD;
in the same listless, dreamy state, wrapped in silent reverie,&#xD;
totally careless and unconscious of the thrilling scenes painted&#xD;
by the rough, but graphic hand of the sturdy frontiersman,&#xD;
and which, seemingly, were of such deep interest to the Ser-&#xD;
geant and Titus.&#xD;
Such, then, was the occupation and appearance of the- little&#xD;
group gathered around the fireside of Sergeant Duffe; but&#xD;
even whilst we have been making this hurried sketch this&#xD;
hearthside assembly had been thrown ito sudden commotion&#xD;
by the Scout abruptly breaking off in one of his narratives,&#xD;
and exclaiming, with ad- energetic gesture, as his watchful ear&#xD;
caught the hoot of an owl, and answer of its mate-&#xD;
Hello ! thar they are, the pesky redskins! Blast my etar-.&#xD;
nal buttons, if them sneakin' Shawanees ain't hootin' to one&#xD;
another; and thar'll be a liftin' of topknts afore mornin', or&#xD;
my name ain't Sharp-Eye !"&#xD;
The Sergeant, Bryan, Madam Duffe, Titus, and even&#xD;
Bang (who should have known better), all sprang to their feet&#xD;
at this startling exclamation of the frontiersman; but the dog&#xD;
..                          g'&#xD;
after a low growl of surprise, and a knowing look 't his master,&#xD;
.as if ashamed of him, quietly resumed his place before the fire,&#xD;
and Duffe, recovering from his momentary alarm, with a laugh&#xD;
at the expense of himself, and the frightened countenances of.&#xD;
his companions, said,&#xD;
"Pshaw, Simon! we are not out in Kentucky that we should&#xD;
be alarmed at the hoot of a harmless owl. You've been talking&#xD;
so much of your Indian adventures, that you fancied yourself&#xD;
back in the forest, and surrounded by yelling redskins.?'&#xD;
"Guess you're right!" said the- Scout, with some confu-&#xD;
sion, resuming his seat; "but it ain't so bad for one to keep&#xD;
his eyes skinned even in this 'ere civilized country: for thar's&#xD;
no tellin', Sargeant, when you may run foul of an enemy."&#xD;
There's some truth in that; and you have one much nearer&#xD;
thian you have any idea," muttered a dark figure, throwing himself&#xD;
&#xD;
13&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
down, close under the shade of the house, and once more (for&#xD;
he, too, had been startled by the cry of Kenton) applying his&#xD;
ear to a crevice, very convenient for eavesdropping.&#xD;
" We don't 'low animals of that ar' kind to be makin' a&#xD;
rumpus out in Kaintuck," said the Scout, apologetically-&#xD;
"do we, Bang.-&#xD;
"Of course not!" growled Bang; and his master,, satisfied&#xD;
that "he knew all about it," continued, turning to Duffe-&#xD;
"I tell you what, Sargeant, when we hear strange noises&#xD;
'round our cabins out West! sich as animals callin' animals,&#xD;
and birds speakin' to birds, like them cussed owls jist now,&#xD;
then we commence gettin' ready, uncommon smart, for the red-&#xD;
skins ; for we knows they'r'bout, jist as well as if we'd seed&#xD;
'em  and ain't to be caught nappin', with tow in our ears, by a&#xD;
blasted sneakin' Ingen !-are we, Bang?'&#xD;
Another sharp growl of assent satisfied the Scout of Bang's&#xD;
attention, and patting his dog kindly, the borderer, with a qia-&#xD;
zical glance at the staring eyeballs of Titus, continued-&#xD;
"Why, Sargeant, you used to think, yourself a smart one&#xD;
'bout the tricks of war, and may-be you wer'; but, blast my&#xD;
coonskins! if you wer' out in Kaintuck, if you wouldn't dis-&#xD;
kiver yourself particularly and distressingly green!, When we&#xD;
fought the Britishers, it was -all plain enough, and straight&#xD;
enough, too, for it was 'forward march! make ready! fire!'&#xD;
and, blaze away we went, altogether, and away run the red-&#xD;
coats, or away we run; for one or the tether had to do it, sartain;&#xD;
and then the thing wer' all over. But, bust my buckskins!"&#xD;
chucked the Scout, slapping his leather pants sufficiently hard&#xD;
to show the strength of his oath, and at the same time laugh-&#xD;
ing at the very idea, "if them ar' kind of tactics would&#xD;
begin to do with the redskins--would they, Bang?"&#xD;
Thus appealed to, Bang said "no!" as plain as a dog could,&#xD;
and with far more politeness than we have known some men&#xD;
to growl that same little negative, when approached for a&#xD;
charity; but the Scout, who was in the habit of making such&#xD;
appeals to his dog, like a great many others we have met with,&#xD;

&#xD;
(who lay more claims to politeness), without waiting for, or&#xD;
noticing his reply, continued-&#xD;
"I tell you what, Sargeant, skulk are the word with us, and&#xD;
'taint wrong neither; for, blast them redskins, they won't stand&#xD;
out like gentlemen, and blaze away by columns, but they jist&#xD;
lay in the long grass, behind logs, and trees, and sich like, and&#xD;
the first you knows ofthar whereabouts is a bullet in your&#xD;
gizzard, a tomahawk through your brain,- and a cussed Ingen&#xD;
trottin' off to cover, with a nice bloody scalplock dangling from&#xD;
his belt. You see, Sargeant, 'taint no 'vantage to be an old&#xD;
soldier, for we jist have to forget all we knows 'bout trainin',&#xD;
and take to this 'ere murderin' way of doin' the business, jist&#xD;
like the 'tarnal savages themselves; and it comes darned na-&#xD;
tural, too, after you've been thar a little while, and the sport's&#xD;
elegant, much better than the old way, for thar's some fun in&#xD;
outdodging a Shawanee, nd no mistake ; Bang knows all 'bout&#xD;
it!"&#xD;
And Bang would have given his usual assent, had not the&#xD;
Scout, without waiting to hear from him, or any one else, con-&#xD;
tinued-&#xD;
"Now, to show you, Sargeant, what audacious cunning&#xD;
devils them dratted redskins are, I'll jist relate you a slight&#xD;
saroumstance that happened to this 'ere individual himself ;&#xD;
and, darn - me  it didn't come in a grazer of losin' me my&#xD;
scalp !"&#xD;
Here the dame stopped her wheel, Titus drew his stool a&#xD;
little nearer, and Bang, as.if watching to catch his master trip-&#xD;
ping, raised his head and cocked his ear in expectation; but&#xD;
the Scout, by no means daunted; commenced his story by&#xD;
saying-&#xD;
"It wer' a short time after I got out to Raintuck, and&#xD;
though I wer' new in the land, I guess I thought myself up&#xD;
to somethin'. I held myself tolerably high, Sargeant, becase&#xD;
of the trainin' you'd gin me durin' the war; but I soon found,&#xD;
asyou'll see, that kind of larnin' wouldn't do, and I wer' as&#xD;
-gren at a tree-frog in Spring-time. When- this 'ere sarcum-a&#xD;
&#xD;
stance happened I am going to tell you consarning, I wer'&#xD;
in one of them forts-not forts like our'n used to be, Sargeant,&#xD;
for they wer'n't nothin' but stakes drove in the ground, and&#xD;
sharpened-and I wer' jist sittin' 'long with Bang by a rousin'&#xD;
great big fire, and not in the all-firedest best humor in the&#xD;
world, I can tell you; for I'd been out huntin' all day, and&#xD;
killed nothin', and the boys had laughed .at me. Well, I wer'&#xD;
jist sittin' thar, thinking' what had 'come of all the buffalo,&#xD;
and deer, and bear I'd earn tell on, when, what should I&#xD;
hear but a blasted turkey, for it wer' near daylight, gobblerin'&#xD;
away, outside the station! Without thinkin' twice, I up with&#xD;
old Betsy, and callin' Bang, went straight to the gate to get&#xD;
the sentinel to let me out; and it wer'n't hard to do, for they&#xD;
don't have any passwords -and army rigulations out thar, but,&#xD;
to tell the truth, the feller at the gate, who wee a knowin' one,&#xD;
and an old hunter, seem' I wer' a green chap, did stop me&#xD;
awhile, and jist cautioned me, sorter laughin' like, sayin' that&#xD;
the turkeys had a quare way of shootin' sometimes in that ar'&#xD;
country, and I'd better look out, or the old gobbler might take&#xD;
the first pop. But thinkin' as how he wer' only pokin' his&#xD;
fun at me, I passed out, never raindin' his caution, jist tellin'&#xD;
him I wer'n't as grassy as some 'folks I'd hearn tell on.&#xD;
Cuss me, Sargeant, if I didn't think, then, I wer' very sharp;&#xD;
and for knowin' all about war, and sich like, wouldn't have&#xD;
given back an inch to the best man in the fort, and this 'ere&#xD;
foolish notion of mine came blamed nigh, as you'll diskiver,&#xD;
bein' the death of me! Well, on we went, Bang and me, from&#xD;
the fort; the old gobbler all the time tryin' himself, as if he&#xD;
knew I wer' comin','and didn't care a cuss; and neither he&#xD;
didn't, for that wer' jist what he wer' after, as it turned out. I&#xD;
crept along more cautious-like, when I got near the woods,&#xD;
for I 'spicioned the gobbler wer'n't far off, and'lidn't want to&#xD;
scare him, which wer' a fact; for suddenly, by the light of the&#xD;
moon .and the coming' day, as I wer' sightin' 'bout into the&#xD;
trees, with old Betsy all ready, what should I see but a rousin'&#xD;
eold cock on his roost! Jist then, Bang, who wer' selling'&#xD;

but a blasted Ingen !"&#xD;
"Gorar-mighty !" muttered Titus.&#xD;
." What, then ?" said Duffe.&#xD;
"I knew I wer' in for it," resumed the Scout, "but I wer'n't&#xD;
goin' to let the dratted rascal 'scape; so, raisin' old Betsy, I jist&#xD;
let the cunnin' thief have the contents; and down he dropped,&#xD;
while I made a rapid devance, as you soldiers have it, to the&#xD;
fort. And I wer'n't a minute too soon neither, foras I turned&#xD;
about, a dozen bullets whistled around me, and one of them&#xD;
give me a dig in the shoulder. The screechin' devils give me&#xD;
a darned hot race to the fort, but I wer' a little too fast for 'em,&#xD;
though I did carry an -ounce of lead in my shoulder; and the&#xD;
feller at the gate, who had been looking out for a-serimmage,&#xD;
'ministered a pill to the foremost of 'em, that he received with&#xD;
a yell, and I guess didn't forgit in a hurry. It wer' a blasted&#xD;
tight race though wer'n't it, Bang? and we didn't go a gobbler-&#xD;
ng again for a smart sprinkle of time after that ar' sarcum-&#xD;
stance."&#xD;
"I golly, Massa Simon !" exclaimed Titus, who had been&#xD;
listening with staring eyes to. the narrow escape of the bor-&#xD;
derer, and could contain himself no longer, "dem Ingens are&#xD;
a dam sight worse dan de Britishers!"&#xD;
"A very narrow escape indeed," muttered the Sergeant,&#xD;
carelessly, and as if but little surprised or interested. Duffe&#xD;
had a veteran's pride, and had determined to be in no way&#xD;
astonished at anything pertaining to war; or, in other words, at&#xD;
anything his old subordiiiate might say. Hence his drowsy&#xD;
carelessness and quiet remark at the conclusion of the Scout's&#xD;
story.&#xD;
"ftNarrow escape !" growled Simon, a little ruffled at the cool&#xD;
.manner the Sergeant had treated his dangerous adventure;&#xD;
"that 'pends altogether on what you call narrow. As for my-&#xD;

self, I thought then, and think now, it wer' a particularly&#xD;
blamed narrow escape.. Ten steps further towards the tree&#xD;
whar that cursed Shawanee wer' shammin' a turkey,,and I'd got&#xD;
a bullet in my gizzard to a sartainty-a hairbreadth closer, and&#xD;
I'd had a dozen whizzing through my head; and had the fort&#xD;
been twenty steps more distant, a tomahawk would have tried&#xD;
the strength of my skull. It wer' only a small sarcumstance,&#xD;
to be sure, and nothin' strange out in Kaintuck, but blast my&#xD;
everlastin' buttons, Sargeant, if I don't think it wer' jist about&#xD;
as all-fired a narrow escape as we ginerally meet with in a&#xD;
hurry-don't you think it wer',-Bang?"&#xD;
The dog replied affirmatively, as plain as any dog could that&#xD;
had not made the English language his study; and Duffe, see-&#xD;
ing that the Scout was not very well pleased with his indiffer-&#xD;
ent manner, hastened to mollify him, by expressing a greater&#xD;
degree of surprise than he had seen proper at first to exhibit.&#xD;
"It wer' darned ticklish times, and no mistake," replied&#xD;
Simon, apparently restored to his good-humor, "and I wouldn't&#xD;
have staked a big pile on winnin'. But that turkey sareum-&#xD;
stance, Sargeant, wer'n't nothin' to what I've known them cun-&#xD;
nin' varmints do. I tell you, it stands a feller, when he goes&#xD;
out to the ' Cane-Land,' to be wide awake and duly sober, if he&#xD;
don't want to lose his scalp."&#xD;
"I should think so," said Duffe.&#xD;
"You'd know it, Sargeant, afore you'd been thar a week.&#xD;
Why bless me, when we go into the woods, we go with our&#xD;
ears, mouth, and eyes all wide open; and even then, ten&#xD;
chances to one if we don't stumble upon some prowlin' redskin,&#xD;
and have to fight or run to save our bacon. Blast me, if I&#xD;
didn't once lay behind a log the better part of a long summer&#xD;
day, with the sun bakin' me like a johnnycake, tryin' all the&#xD;
time to git the first shot at an Ingen I thought wer' layin' be-&#xD;
hind a log 'bout twenty yards off."&#xD;
" And what was the result?" asked Duffe.&#xD;
"Well, my dander riz so high at last, I couldn't stand it&#xD;
any longer, so I jist bawled out to him, in good English (for I&#xD;

men."&#xD;
"What did he say to this very fair proposition ?" asked&#xD;
IDuffe, with a smile.&#xD;
"No sooner had I sung out than I beam  a laugh, and then&#xD;
the feller from the tother log hailed me in my own lingo; and&#xD;
what do'you think, Sargeant ?--cuss me, if it wer'n't one of the&#xD;
boys from the fort, who had taken me for a redskin; and thar&#xD;
he'd been, jist like myself, waitin' all day for a shot ! It wer'&#xD;
a mutual mistake; bit you may take my hide if it wer'n't co -&#xD;
siderable provokin', and I guess we wer'n't in no hurry to tell&#xD;
how we'd been fooled."&#xD;
Duffe greeted this story of the borderer with a hearty&#xD;
laugh ; old Titus, with a broad grin, keeping him' company; and&#xD;
for -a few moments the little group were silent.&#xD;
"I say, Sargeant," said the Scout, again breaking silence,&#xD;
and once more raising his deep voice above the low mellow&#xD;
hum of Mrs. Duffe's twirling wheel, "it ar' 'bout time you wer'&#xD;
leavin' this 'ere old tumble-down consarn, for it's a plague&#xD;
shame for a man to stay here, when it's so easy to move out to&#xD;
the' canebrakes, whar the lands are rich, and buffalo beef and&#xD;
venison as plenty as musquitoes here on the Yadkin. I'm jist&#xD;
out'r that country, and you know I wouldn't lie to an old&#xD;
comrade; and-I tell you now, it ar', without any bamboozling&#xD;
'bout the matter, the greatest place this side of sundown."&#xD;
've been thinking of what you propose," replied Duffe,&#xD;
"and if you hav'n't scared my good lady with your bloody&#xD;
stories of the Indians, and Bryan and Titus are willing, then I,&#xD;
for one,'am ready for the change."&#xD;
. "Scared the good lady !" laughed Simon, with a quizzical&#xD;
look at the stout person of Mrs. Duffe; "I'd like to see the fel-&#xD;
ler, be he Tory or redskin, what would 'undertake that ar'&#xD;
operation. Why, darn me, if I don't 'spect to see the.day&#xD;
when Sally will string Ingen scalps like pumpkin-rinds, and&#xD;
think no 'more of tomnahawkin' a Shawane. than. slicing the&#xD;
&#xD;
jugular of a turkey. As for old Titus, thar, I knows without&#xD;
axin' him that lie's in for it, right off; and it will be darned&#xD;
strange if some redskin don't git that, woolly scalp of his'n.&#xD;
They've a great liking for nigger topknots, Titus, for they jist&#xD;
cover thar pouches with all sich beauties, and pass them off in&#xD;
thar big powwows for bear scalps. What say you, beauty ?"&#xD;
" Bless de Lord, Massa Simon !" exclaimed Titus, with a&#xD;
sympathetic move of his hand to his woolly pate, "don't talk&#xD;
so! Me ready to follow whareber Massa Bryan go1"&#xD;
"I know'd it !" exclaimed the Scout in high glee, extend-&#xD;
ing his broad hand to the black. " Thar's my hand, Titus, if&#xD;
you are a nigger, for we've fought the redcoats together; and&#xD;
may I be scalped by a bloody Shawanee, if Bang, and you, and&#xD;
me won't give the tarnal red devils particular goss when we git&#xD;
out to Kaintucky-won't we, Bang?"&#xD;
The dog again gave an audible assent to this proposed bloody&#xD;
alliance, and the borderer, turning his weather-beaten face&#xD;
towards where Bryan still sat in unconscious reverie, good-&#xD;
humoredly exclaimed, "I say, Mister Bryan, if you ain't par-&#xD;
ticularly interested in lookin' into that ar' cap of your'n, I'd&#xD;
like to know your views 'bout goin' West along with the Sar-&#xD;
geant and Titus, not forgettin' Sally, and Bang, and me, for&#xD;
we've all agreed."&#xD;
Startled from his reverie by this direct inquiry of the bor-&#xD;
derer, Bryan removed ,his cap, looking, inquiringly at the&#xD;
speaker, as if not fully comprehending his question, exposing,&#xD;
as he did so, a strongly marked handsome face, beautified by a&#xD;
pair of dark flashing eyes, and shaded by heavy masses of long&#xD;
black hair. Without stopping foran answer, the Scout, see-&#xD;
ing that he had aroused the att tion of Head, went on to&#xD;
speak of his own, and the Sergeant's, and -Mrs. Duffe's affec-&#xD;
tion for him, and their determination to go West; pointing out&#xD;
the many inducements for the change, and winding up by&#xD;
promising him, if he would only go with them, to show him&#xD;

"I need no assurance of your affection," said the young man,&#xD;
with emotion, when Simon had finished; "and as for my;fos-&#xD;

when you have done this, the Sargeant, and Titus, and me, not&#xD;
forgettin' Sally and Bang, will make an elegant colony ; and&#xD;
blast my coonskin !" shouted the borderer, throwing down his&#xD;
cap, as he became excited with the prospect, "how we'll worry&#xD;
the redskins ! Hoop ! hurrah ! 'tis settled!' Remember, Mis-&#xD;
ter Bryan, I'll furnish  _Josses, for I know jist whar the&#xD;
thievin' Shawanees ke.ep 4 critters--don't we, Bang ?"&#xD;
Aroused by the hoop ! hurrah! of the borderer, and his excited&#xD;
manner, Bang, instead of his ,usual low growl of assent, gave&#xD;
forth a loud and lively bark to this query of his master, and&#xD;
the Scout showed his satisfaction by giving his brute, companion&#xD;
a hearty slap upon the back, sufficiently forcible to have sent&#xD;
a majority of the canine tribe howling into the corner. -&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.              21&#xD;
" As I was going to remark," continued Bryan, with a smile&#xD;
at the enthusiasm of his semi-savage friend, "when you in-&#xD;
terrupted me, I am very poor, Simon, and am afraid I would&#xD;
only be a charge upon the colony, as I am totally unfit for the&#xD;
heavy labor of a backwoodsman."&#xD;
" Thar you're out'r it," shouted Simon, again interrupting&#xD;
him. "We don't labor any out in Kaintuck; everything is&#xD;
furnished to. order ; and as for charging, there's nothin' of it&#xD;
'cept charging a rifle and the redskins. Remember, I'll fur-&#xD;
nish the losses, Mister Bryan; thar's no fear on that score; and&#xD;
I'll kill the buffalo and venison; Titus will raise all the corn&#xD;
we want; and thar'll be nothin' for you to do but be colonel of&#xD;
the militia, and the Sargeant will do the drillin', for he's up to&#xD;
all such cussed stuff. Hoop ! hurrah ! the thing ar' settled;&#xD;
give me your hand on it, Mister Bryan."&#xD;
Seeing that Kenton would take no refusal, Bryan grasped&#xD;
the extended hand of the borderer, saying, "fI'll think about&#xD;
it, Simon, but am not yet certain, for I have a matter of deep in-&#xD;
terest to me first to settle, before I can determine upon any fixed&#xD;
plan to govern my future motions. But, let my determination&#xD;
be what it may," he added, in a shaking voice, as if deeply&#xD;
affected, "you shall know it in a few days, and I will ever re-&#xD;
member your affection for me, and ever grasp with love, as I&#xD;
now do, your honest hand."&#xD;
" Cuss - the water,' grumbled the Scout, brushing with&#xD;
brawny hand his misty eye; "I couldn't now draw bead on a&#xD;
buffalo. No more of your kind words, Mister, Bryan, or old&#xD;
Simon will lose his eyesight, and no longer be called Sharp-&#xD;
Eye. But what's the great matter on hand? May-be I can be&#xD;
of sarvice ?"&#xD;
"I don't think it's in your line, Simon," laughed Duffe,&#xD;
glancing merrily at his wife, who nodded her head-significantly&#xD;
in return.&#xD;
"0 O!" exclaimed the Scout, "if Sally's got any winkin' in&#xD;
this 'ere matter, the thing's explained, and a gal must be at-the&#xD;
bottom of it. 'Taint that ar' nice little chick, the daughter of&#xD;

Squire Lacy, I met the tother day?   Don't be squeamish,&#xD;
Mister Bryan," added the borderer; "you are good enough for&#xD;
any of 'en, I don't care how high they fly. If&#xD;
yes," continued the Scout, sententiously, and with all the ravays&#xD;
of a philosopher, " take her; if you say andy&#xD;
- let' her go; but if you say yes, and she says yes, and the old&#xD;
'squire (a pesky old 'ristocrat, though he did fight for liberty,&#xD;
I guess he's at some of his tantrums) says no, then take her&#xD;
anyhow. That's the way we do up ths thing out in Kaintuck&#xD;
ain't it, Bang ?"&#xD;
Not liking, perhaps, to be present when a dog was to be con-&#xD;
sulted on love-matters, Bryan took advantage of Bang's usual&#xD;
growl of assent to blushingly beat a hasty retreat.&#xD;
"He has fled the charge, Simon," said Dufe laughing&#xD;
" and I guess you were pretty near right, and. that the 'squire'&#xD;
daughter has something to do in delaying our journey West.&#xD;
But come, we must break up; Sally has put back ler wheel,&#xD;
and that, you know, is as strong a hint to retire to quarters, as&#xD;
the tattoo during the wars."&#xD;
May I be teetotaciously used up," soliloquized the Scout,&#xD;
the Sergeant and his wife having retired "if these g   't&#xD;
bg                            ,      eegals aint&#xD;
born devils, and no mistake; and they can't help it neither; for&#xD;
it ar' jist natural for them to do what they please with us men.&#xD;
But blame me," he added, with a knowing smile, "if sh 'i't&#xD;
pretty one, and no wonder Mr. Bryan is agin leaving' her.&#xD;
We'll just have to take her along, too; I see that without spec-&#xD;
tickles.  Jello, Bang,"- he continued, turning to his dog, who&#xD;
seee to somewhat uneasy, and had more than once made&#xD;
known his uneasiness by a low growl of rage, "stop your&#xD;
rumpus and let's to bed,. we've made a fool of ourselves&#xD;
once to-night 'bout them blasted owls, and it ar' no use, I tell&#xD;
you, to notice either sounds or smells in this 'ere civilized&#xD;
country."&#xD;
Wrapping himself in a blanket, for he declared the feather-&#xD;
beds made his bones ache, Simon threw himself down before&#xD;
the fire, with his rifle by his side, motioning Bang to take his&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
place close by him; but the dog still continuing uneasy and&#xD;
restless, he enforced his command by exclaiming, angrily,&#xD;
"Down with you, I say; it ain't nothin' but Titus snoring , and&#xD;
that's the way with niggers. But darn me," he added, with -a&#xD;
low laugh, as Bang crept to his side, a"if he only had a brick-&#xD;
bat laid on his nose, if he wouldn't jist blow his brains out,&#xD;
and be committin' a suicide  in his sleep."&#xD;
A minute later, and the Scout himself, from the way he&#xD;
snored, was even in more danger than Titus of becoming a&#xD;
febo de se in his sleep, dying, if not by his own band, his own&#xD;
nose.&#xD;
" The young cock flies high, and would mate with the eagle,"&#xD;
muttered the eavesdropper, as he stole cautiously away; "but&#xD;
he'll be disappointed. My young master will never marry&#xD;
Miss Coma, for I'll away now to one who, I guess, will not only&#xD;
pay me well for my news, but soon clip the goshawk's wing.&#xD;
Ha ! ha !' laughed the spy, pushing his way through the forest,&#xD;
and speaking with an unpleasant chuckle of satisfaction, coupled&#xD;
with an oath : " It was lucky I came over to see what brought&#xD;
.Simon Kenton into these parts. The great Scout little dreams&#xD;
that his old enemy, Simon Girty, the renegade and bloody de-&#xD;
stroyer of the settlements, has been so near him to-night. But&#xD;
I must be cautious," he continued, in a less confident tone, "for&#xD;
that infernal dog of his was not so unsuspicious as his master,&#xD;
and the neighborhood of Sharp-Eye is not the safest place in&#xD;
the world for me that would not be known. But I won't give&#xD;
up the game because I've started an enemy," thought the rene-&#xD;
gfade. "Let me first squeeze a little money out of my old&#xD;
captain, and have my revenge upon this young fledgling, the&#xD;
son of my old enemy, and then, Simon Kenton, you may have&#xD;
a clear field of it, for I'll soon put the Blue Ridge between&#xD;
you and me."&#xD;

CHAPTER       II.&#xD;
A FEW miles distant from the unpretending home of Ser-&#xD;
geant Duffe, and on the same evening of which we have been&#xD;
speaking, were assembled in the stately parlor of General Jbe&#xD;
Lacy three persons--the general, his fair daughter Coma, and&#xD;
Captain Jean Montlack-&#xD;
The rough, unornamented, and unfurnished room in the hum-&#xD;
ble farm-house of the Sergeant was not more unlike the grand&#xD;
and richly decorated drawing-room of the general, than were&#xD;
the persons now gathered within the precincts of the latter un-&#xD;
like those discovered around the comfortable but lowly fireside&#xD;
of the former. In the one was found, if not poverty, barely a&#xD;
remove above it, simplicity, and we might add, with an excep-&#xD;
tion, man unpolished and uneducated; but, as a set-off, there&#xD;
was kindness of heart, unanimity of feeling, bravery, and honesty.&#xD;
In the other was wealth, polish, and beauty, 'and along with&#xD;
them, as is nearly always the case, pride, hauteur, coldness,&#xD;
and deceit. One was a living, unadorned picture of honest,&#xD;
unsophisticated nature; the other, a striking representation of&#xD;
nature, remodelled and retouched by the polishing hand of&#xD;
man, aided by the gilding power of wealth. One, like a fair&#xD;
old picture of Titian.or Raphael, was deathless, and ever afford-&#xD;
ing pleasure, because drawn from life, and without spangle or&#xD;
gloss; the other, a flashy, gaudy child of more modern times,&#xD;
admired and sought after by many, on account of its fresh and&#xD;
.brilliant coloring, but without nature. Yet those three persons,&#xD;
assembled within the sumptuous hall of De Lacy, are destined'&#xD;
to mingle long and intimately with the more humble guests of&#xD;
the Sergeant; and the younger and fairer of the three, the beau-&#xD;
tiful Coma, as may have already been discovered by the reader,&#xD;

holds under her control the fate and future destiny of the or-&#xD;
phan Bryan, the foster-child of Duffe.&#xD;
General De Lacy, the proprietor of the. splendid mansion&#xD;
we have just been describing, and of the broad acres stretching&#xD;
out for many miles around, was a descendant of a noble Hu-&#xD;
guenot family, driven from France by religious persecution&#xD;
during the days of the De Medici, and, when we introduce him&#xD;
to the reader, was about five-and-fifty years of age, and had&#xD;
been a widower for many years. Much to his secret chagrin,&#xD;
the general had been blessed with only one child, his beautiful&#xD;
daughter Coma; and although he treated her with the utmost&#xD;
kindness, and was, as much as his common pride would per-&#xD;
mit, a most devoted father, still, he could not but regret, and&#xD;
sometimes complainingly lament, the want of a son, to transmit&#xD;
his ancient and time-honored name down to posterity! His&#xD;
greatest care, now, was to watch over his daughter, and guard&#xD;
her against any unworthy alliance; and, as he was very proud,&#xD;
and very punctilious, and very fearful of her making an un-&#xD;
equal match, we might add that this was the greatest fear and&#xD;
annoyance of his life; and that poor Coma, if she waited for&#xD;
his consent and approbation, had the very smallest of numbers&#xD;
out of which to choose a husband;- and, notwithstanding her&#xD;
beauty and golden charms, bid fair to become an old maid.&#xD;
Yet the general, notwithstanding his pride of wealth and family,&#xD;
had cut quite a conspicuous figure during the War of the Revo-&#xD;
lution,, not sparing either his blood or money, and was very&#xD;
highly esteemed and honored by Washington and his compeers&#xD;
of that stormy period. Whether he was induced to take the&#xD;
active part he did in the War for Independence, by his love of&#xD;
freedom and equality, or by the national hatred he bore to all&#xD;
things English, inherited from his fathers, we are unable to&#xD;
say; but are disposed to be charitable, and will, therefore,&#xD;
ascribe his course to patriotism alone! But this much we do&#xD;
know, that, although the general had subscribed to the Decla-&#xD;
ration of Independence, declaring ,all men free and equal, he&#xD;
did so with a proviso, meaning thereby that all men, politically&#xD;

26                   SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
speaking, were free and equal; but personally, it was quite a&#xD;
different matter, and be considered very few persons and very&#xD;
few families equal to himself, or his own. Yet the general,&#xD;
barring his aristocratic notions, was a very worthy man, noble&#xD;
and hospitable, kind to his inferiors, urbane to his equals, and&#xD;
only haughty and forbidding to the presumptuous, or when he&#xD;
believed the fate of his daughter, Coma, was in any way in-&#xD;
volved.&#xD;
Captain Jean Montlack was also a son of sunny France, only&#xD;
a little more direct, and a little more recent than the general,&#xD;
to whom he was related, not very near, to be sure, but still the&#xD;
nearest blood-relation known to De Lacy; and, therefore,&#xD;
though very unworthily, standing very high in his affection&#xD;
and estimation.-&#xD;
Montlack, before he had reached the age of thirty, had dis-&#xD;
sipated a large fortune, and transferred to his urgent creditors&#xD;
his entire estate; but, about this time, when on the verge of&#xD;
utter ruin, hearing of his rich relation in America, and of his&#xD;
devotion to the cause of the struggling colonies, he cunningly&#xD;
offered his services to the patriotic and chivalrous young La-&#xD;
fayette, and was, in a moment, and by this act alone, for he&#xD;
had done nothing meritorious before, forever fixed in the affec-&#xD;
tion of De. Lacy.  Upon his arrival in, the States, Captain&#xD;
Jean immediately made himself known to the general; and,&#xD;
notwithstanding his former extravagances and irregularities of&#xD;
life, became, at once, by his cunning and plausible manner, a&#xD;
prime favorite of his old relation, and, by his apparent devo-.&#xD;
the Revolution, insured to himself the protection and support&#xD;
of De Lacy. Montlack, with the polite, fashionable air of a&#xD;
well-bred Frenchman, was quite a passable personage, and a&#xD;
very pleasant companions yet, notwithstanding his polished&#xD;
and gentlemanly exterior, and well-acted sincerity and honorable,&#xD;
bearing, he was in reality nothing more than a plausible, flat-&#xD;
tering scoundrel, devoid of, all principle, utterly selfish and&#xD;
:1       treacherous, and withal, as near as a Frenchman could be, a&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THESCOUT'S REVENGE.               27&#xD;
coward! After the Revolution, by the invitation of his de-&#xD;
ceived relative, he became an inmate of his house, and a part&#xD;
of his family; and, from that time onward, bent every energy&#xD;
of his cunning head and corrupt heart to transfer into his own&#xD;
pockets the splendid estate of the unsuspecting De Lacy! At&#xD;
the period of his introduction to the reader, the captain was&#xD;
somewhere betweenthirty and thirty-five years of age; tall&#xD;
and graceful, with the dark skin and eyes and hair of his na-&#xD;
tive land; but his countenance and appearance still showed&#xD;
evident traces of excess and dissipation; for, notwithstanding&#xD;
his apparent reformation, he was' yet, in private, and when&#xD;
beyond the vision of the general and his daughter, as much&#xD;
devoted as ever to drink, and gaming, and other low vices.&#xD;
But the cunning captain had dotted dowr in his own mind&#xD;
his plans for accumulating wealth, and thereby satisfying his&#xD;
extravagant follies, and was now surely, but cautiouly, deve-&#xD;
loping his scheme, so as not to startle the general, or alarm&#xD;
the sensitive fears of his trusting cousin, the destined victim&#xD;
of his plot. Captain Jean was well skilled in the secret work-&#xD;
ings of the heart, and knew right fairly what chords to touch,&#xD;
to move the proud soul of his noble relative to his will, and&#xD;
the captain thought himself equally well versed in "woman&#xD;
lore ;" but that fact is yet to be proved, and future chapters&#xD;
will make known his success or failure.&#xD;
Coma De Lacy, the only daughter of the general, and future&#xD;
heiress of all his broad lands, was a fit subject for a villain's&#xD;
wiles, for she had seen and known but little of the world, and,&#xD;
secluded in her father's mansion, with no companions but her&#xD;
governess and teachers, knew but little of the treachery and&#xD;
deceit of mankind; and what little she did know was obtained&#xD;
from the light romance% in her frher's ample library, and&#xD;
which her truthful, unsuspecting hert, and the assurances of&#xD;
her simple-minded governess (poor woman!) taught her to be-&#xD;
lieve were altogether ideal and false.&#xD;
Seeing but few persons at her father's house, and constantly&#xD;
dependent upon Montlack for amusement and entertainment,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8248-00000015"/>&#xD;
28                   SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
accomplished as he was, and devoted as he pretended to be,&#xD;
Coma was in a very fair way to surrender up her trusting&#xD;
young heart to her unfeeling and treacherous cousin; and the&#xD;
general was not displeased at all at the evident advance Mont-&#xD;
lack was making in the affections of his daughter; for the cap-&#xD;
tam, by his flattery and zeal, had become almost'-absolutely&#xD;
necessary to the happiness of his relative; and De Lacy, on&#xD;
account of his relationship and noble family, deemed the plausi-&#xD;
ble captain a very fit person to assume his name and fortune.&#xD;
But the fair Coma, inheriting all the warm passions of her&#xD;
fatherland, had of late met with one who had suddenly changed&#xD;
all of her preconceived opinions of the perfectibility of Mon-&#xD;
sieur Jean, and taught her the difference not only between&#xD;
genuine and feigned nobility of heart, but the very vast dif-&#xD;
ference between cousinly, unimpassioned affection and impas-&#xD;
sioned love. Of late, she had been somewhat indifferent and&#xD;
listless to the usual ceremonious kindness of Montlack; and,&#xD;
without knowing, herself, what had caused this very great&#xD;
change in her feelings towards him, continued to dream in&#xD;
secret of one she had met at a small party at H-.  and fre-&#xD;
quently, since that time, in her daily walks through the grounds&#xD;
of her father.&#xD;
Montlack, with the quick instinct of a suspicious heart, had&#xD;
already discovered the..change in her feelings toward himself;&#xD;
and, without knowing, or even suspecting the cause-for who&#xD;
could be his rival ?-had become vastly uneasy; and, while&#xD;
racking his very brain to unravel the mystery, redoubled his&#xD;
exertions to please, and redraw, under his ancient sway, the&#xD;
truant heart now fluttering to break the silken, but strong&#xD;
meshes he had thrown around it.&#xD;
"4Coma, dear," said the captain, in a sweet, low tone, such&#xD;
as women love, with fraternal affection drawing his chair still&#xD;
nearer his cousin, and glancing his eye at the general, who&#xD;
seemed buried in the book he was reading, "have I offended&#xD;
you in anything, of late ?"&#xD;
" Why do you think so ?"- replied Coma, listlessly, as she&#xD;
&#xD;
FL!&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.29&#xD;
stooped to examine closely some maiden trifle she was engaged&#xD;
in ornamenting.&#xD;
" Why, you seem cold and indifferent to my efforts at pleas-&#xD;
ing, and, not knowing that I have done anything to deserve&#xD;
your displeasure, I have fancied, dear Coma, and have been&#xD;
much pained at the fancy, that I must have unwittingly done&#xD;
something to incur your disfavor ?"&#xD;
"I know of nothing that you have done, Jean, worthy of&#xD;
my displeasure; and am not conscious of any coldness, on my&#xD;
part, towards you," she replied, without intending it, in the&#xD;
same careless, listless manner.&#xD;
""There now, Cousin Coma," continued Montlack, with an&#xD;
effort at gayety, whatt offended queen or displeased beauty&#xD;
ever answered a suppliant courtier or lover with more frigid&#xD;
politeness than you have just done your afflicted cousin?&#xD;
"Psha! Jean!" replied Coma, in a manner throwing off her&#xD;
listlessness, "why do you make such a bugaboo of nothing?"&#xD;
" And do you think it nothing, Coma," answered Mont-&#xD;
lack, skilfully taking advantage of the opportunity offered him,&#xD;
and throwing all of his soul into his low trembling voice, whilst&#xD;
he gazed sadly and sorrowfully into her face, "4to be treated&#xD;
thus by one we love ?--to feel and know that we are treated&#xD;
coldly, and, when we would learn the cause, so that we might&#xD;
try and remove it, if' possible, to have our inquiries answered&#xD;
carelessly and indifferently, and our sorrow almost mocked at?&#xD;
It was not always thus,, Coma; and I can but feel it!"&#xD;
"(Why, my dear Jean, what in the world is the matter?"&#xD;
said Coma, quickly, and looking kindly into his face, for she&#xD;
had been touched by the sorrowful tones of Montlack. "Your&#xD;
little Coma feels no coldness towards her kind cousin; and, next&#xD;
to her father, loves him before all others."&#xD;
Coma thought, at the time, she was speaking the truth, and&#xD;
sincerely; but, at the next moment, the memory of another&#xD;
flitted across her vision, and she unconsciously blushed.&#xD;
" Would that I could believe what- you have just said was&#xD;
true, and that your love was more than a cousinly affection!1"&#xD;
&#xD;
'&#xD;
,y&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC8248-00000016"/>&#xD;
SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
murmured Montlack, sadly; and bending still nearer his cousin,&#xD;
he continued: "But even now, Coma, it seems to me that your&#xD;
thoughts are wandering away from him that would fain call&#xD;
them all his own."&#xD;
Coma blushed, but said nothing, for this was the first time&#xD;
that Montlack had ever been so bold in urging his suit, and&#xD;
the distinction he had made between love and cousinly affec-&#xD;
tion had thrown a brand into her heart, and set her thoughts&#xD;
agoing; and she now began to feel that he was right, and that&#xD;
the love he would fain have was not his, but another's.&#xD;
waI see it, I see it all, Coma! Your telltale face declares&#xD;
what my trembling heart has long feared. You donot think&#xD;
of your cousin Jean as you once did; and some other, more&#xD;
fortunate than I, has stolen the heart of my little pet."&#xD;
The captain, although his heart was raging with suspicious&#xD;
jealousy, and he was scarce able to restrain his fury, spoke in&#xD;
a sad and melancholy, tone, as if conscious of his. doom, but&#xD;
ready to submit to his unhappy fate; and so greatly was the&#xD;
warm-hearted Coma affected by his feigned sorrow, that she&#xD;
burst into tears, exclaiming,&#xD;
"0 Jean, you do me wrong! 'pon my soul, you wrong me!&#xD;
Your Coma thinks of you now, as she has ever done, as the&#xD;
kindest, and dearest, and most affectionate of cousins."&#xD;
There !" exclaimed Montlack, no longer able to restrain&#xD;
his anger.   "It is ever cousin, cousin, cousin! Tell me,&#xD;
Coma," he added, bitterly, and with the smile of a baffled&#xD;
fiend, "who is it that has stolen your heart, and made me&#xD;
wretched?"&#xD;
"You forget yourself, Jean !" replied Coma, with a flash of&#xD;
anger at his bold request and peremptory tone; and, rising&#xD;
hastily from her seat, haughtily added, "I do not permit such&#xD;
language, not even from a dear cousin."&#xD;
The captain ground his teeth with rage; but, discovering,&#xD;
when too kate to remedy what he had spoken, that passion had&#xD;
got the better of his discretion and politeness, hesitated a mo-&#xD;
nment how to reply; but the general, aroused by the angry&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S RtEVENGE.             31&#xD;
voice of his daughter, saved him, the trouble of an explaation,&#xD;
b  exclaiming&#xD;
" Hollo, children! What the deuce has got into you? Are&#xD;
you quarreling there in downright earnest, or are you nly&#xD;
layin tragedy for the benefit of puss on the hearth-rug ?"&#xD;
"Only playing tragedy, sir! and Coma was rehearsing her&#xD;
part," replied Montlack, with a light laugh; all appearance of&#xD;
anger or mortification having fled from his countenance.&#xD;
"Better that than a quarrel, and better folly than anger,"&#xD;
said the general, sententiously.&#xD;
"I was just trying to find out whether my fair cousin inhe-&#xD;
rited any of our old French passion," continued Montlack, in the&#xD;
same light tone, "and discover she has no lack of it, but is&#xD;
off like a flash, and woe be to him in reach of the explosion !"&#xD;
"La belle France forever! -The old blood will never be&#xD;
washed out, but continue the same through a hundred gene-&#xD;
rations," replied the general, good-humoredly.&#xD;
Coma regarded the specious and treacherous captain, whilst&#xD;
he made this explanation, in utter and silent astonishment; for&#xD;
she was really at a loss to know, when she beheld his smooth&#xD;
and smiling face, whether what had just happened was real or&#xD;
imaginary; and, if real, whether Monsieur Jean had been in&#xD;
earnest, or merely trifling pith her.&#xD;
But the general, put ih a good humor by the captain's&#xD;
jocose manner, and well pleased with his own terse replies, did&#xD;
not allow her much time for thought; for, throwing down his&#xD;
book, and advancing towards them, he exclaimed-&#xD;
" Monsieur Jean dogs not know my little jade'as well as her&#xD;
father,' or he would have saved himself this experiment. But&#xD;
come, Coma," he added, with a smiling face, turning towards&#xD;
his daughter, "we will have no more tragedy to-night; and if&#xD;
you will only sing us our usual evening song, we'll away&#xD;
to bed."&#xD;
Without another thought respecting the falsehood and hypo-&#xD;
crisy of the captain, at this request of her father, Coma seated&#xD;
herself by her harp, and sang a sweet, but sad. song, for her&#xD;

heart was heavy; and Montlack, now that the burning Are&#xD;
of jealousy had been excited in his bosom, quickly noticed, and&#xD;
with a bitter smile, that it was a new song-not one of those&#xD;
they had often sung together and a song of love'&#xD;
Kissing her father, and bowing more coldly than was her&#xD;
wont to the captain, Coma glided from the room; and, notwith-&#xD;
standing the little storm that had just ruffled the quiet of her&#xD;
heart, was soon buried in sweet memories of the new passion&#xD;
she had so lately discovered.&#xD;
Montlack's pillow that night was not one of roses, and, if&#xD;
he slept at all, it was like the stormy Petrel, rocked and dashed&#xD;
about upon furious waves. His cunning plans were tottering,&#xD;
and that, to one of his temperament, was sufficient to turn&#xD;
hell loose in his bosom.  "Eh ! Master Jean, you have made&#xD;
many conquests- in your time, but you are now conning the&#xD;
first lesson in love; and, as strange as it may appear to your&#xD;
rebellious heart, are in a fair way of becoming the victimized,&#xD;
instead of the victimizer."&#xD;
CHAPTER         III.&#xD;
BREAKFAST was over at the mansion of De Lacy, and with-&#xD;
out the usual pleasant morning chat, for there was a constraint&#xD;
upon Montlack and Coma; the first busy with his secret de-&#xD;
termination to discover the cause of the recent change in the&#xD;
feelings of his cousin towards himself; and the latter equally&#xD;
busy with the pleasant imaginings of her teeming brain.&#xD;
The general had retired to his study, and Montlack, ordering&#xD;
his horse, had galloped furiously away, when Coma, gliding&#xD;
from the house, tripped gayly along the path leading to that&#xD;
part of the grounds where, for the last two or three weeks, she&#xD;
tilmore than once met the young hunter, and held sweet con-&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.               33&#xD;
verse with him concerning the birds, and flowers, and beautiful&#xD;
scenes around.&#xD;
It was a bright morning, and Coma, although more happy&#xD;
than she had ever been before, felt that she did not go forth to&#xD;
the meceting with the young stranger with the same feeling&#xD;
that she had done even the day previous. Then it was with a&#xD;
free bounding tread, and a free, gay, unsuspecting heart, glad&#xD;
to converse with one so gentle, and so eloquent in his descrip-&#xD;
tions of birds, and flowers, and gurgling waters; brit now it&#xD;
was with a heart burning with a new passion, one lately dis-&#xD;
covered, but so bright and glowing as to thrill and dance&#xD;
through her throbbing heart, like the sweet, low tones of dis-&#xD;
tant music to the almost slumbering ear, or like the gurgling&#xD;
sound of glad leaping waters in summer-time, when, weary, you&#xD;
throw yourself down upon the bank of some murmuring stream.&#xD;
In a word, it was a strange, but most pleasing timidity, and one&#xD;
never before experienced by Coma. For the first time, she did&#xD;
not go straight to the rendezvous, but often stopped in a mus-&#xD;
ing attitude, as if to dream awhile; or as if fearful the wild,&#xD;
unusual emotion she then enjoyed might be destroyed by the&#xD;
meeting. And, then, most strange to her inexperienced heart,&#xD;
she felt a hesitation and doubt respecting the propriety of the&#xD;
move she was now making, that had never before crossed her&#xD;
artless mind in arty of her former meetings with Bryan. She&#xD;
was fully aware now that she had lost her heart, and uncon-&#xD;
sciously given her affections to the young stranger, and at&#xD;
once all her maiden delicacy and reserve came forth to increase&#xD;
her fast gathering fears and hesitation.&#xD;
But her fears, and her doubts, and her coyness were alike&#xD;
soon dispelled by a full, rich voice, carolling an old ditty but&#xD;
a short distance off, and the next moment, having passed a&#xD;
small cluster of trees, Bryan stood in full view, and, bounding&#xD;
forward, soon knelt gracefully at her feet, presenting a tiny&#xD;
bouquet of early spring flowers.&#xD;
"I have gathered these little jewels of sunshine dew," he&#xD;
exclaimed, "hoping that, as they are the first smiles of coming&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8248-00000018"/>&#xD;

spring, Miss Coma would deign to accept them from the hand&#xD;
of one that would willingly gather all the jewels of earth, and&#xD;
bind them around her fair brow."&#xD;
"Most willingly,- Monsieur Bryan," replied Coma, a bright&#xD;
smile of pleasure mantlig over her blushing face; "but I fear&#xD;
me your friendship would burden my poor brow with quite too&#xD;
heavy a crown, if I am to believe that your will would be in-&#xD;
consonance with your present flattering wish."&#xD;
Believe me, fair lady," said Bryan, gallantly, as he led&#xD;
Coma to a moss-covered seat near the bluff bank of the Yadkin,&#xD;
my will would only be to give you pleasure; and could gems,&#xD;
or pearls, or flowers add one charm to that pure brow of yours,&#xD;
then would I dare all the monsters of the deep and the hot sun&#xD;
of the tropics to gather and place them there."&#xD;
"Alas, poor me!" said Coma, with a mock sigh; "now that&#xD;
you have commenced with flattery, I can believe you no more.&#xD;
I had thought that my kind teacher of 'wood lore' was all&#xD;
truth; but, alas! poor deceived maiden that I am, I will now&#xD;
have to forget all that I have learned; and even that pretty&#xD;
story you told me of the wounded bird I must believe with&#xD;
many doubts. Ah me, ah me !"&#xD;
Had Montlack witnessed the tragic air with which his cou-&#xD;
sin made known her feigned, sorrow, he would have considered&#xD;
her anything but a tyro at dramatic representation; but Bryan&#xD;
was too much in love to fully enjoy her histrionic powers, or&#xD;
look upon anything she said or did'either as comic or burlesque ;&#xD;
and when she had concluded, placing his hand upon his heart,&#xD;
said, "Whenever you find -me guilty of flattery, Miss Coma&#xD;
then will I willingly submit to be branded as a traitor and&#xD;
deceiver; but as yet, Iplead 'not guilty' to the charge, and con-&#xD;
tend that sentence cannot justly be passed upon me"&#xD;
"Worse and worse, Monsieur Bryan," said Coma, attempt-&#xD;
ing to conceal her blushes under a merry voice and gay badi-&#xD;
nage; "for, after what you have just said, I consider this last&#xD;
speech of yours the grossest flattery, Down upon your knees,&#xD;
&#xD;
*1&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.             35&#xD;
fair sir, and let's hear what you have to say why sentence&#xD;
shall not be rendered at once."&#xD;
 "And now, Coma-let me call you by that endearing title,"&#xD;
murmured the lover, dropping upon his knees at her laughing&#xD;
command, and speaking in a low, agitated voice-"as I am&#xD;
arraigned before you, and you are my judge, listen to me&#xD;
kindly for a moment, and if you think me rash and presump-&#xD;
tuous, have mercy, and ascribe all to my love; for even here'-&#xD;
now, as I kneel before you at your own command, and gaze&#xD;
upon that fair face of yours that I may lose by my rashness&#xD;
forever, I cannot restrain my bursting heart but must say that&#xD;
I love you !"&#xD;
The fair judge could not be unkind to so eloquent a pleader,&#xD;
and could not look coldly upon the beaming face of the gallant&#xD;
youth bending so gracefully at her feet; but, whilst blushing&#xD;
roses, and with one tiny hand vainly striving to still her throb-&#xD;
bing heart, she extended the other to Bryan, murmuring, "You&#xD;
are forgiven; your judge is a partial one; and the love you bear&#xD;
me is-"&#xD;
"Returned !" exclaimed Bryan, folding her yielding form in&#xD;
his arms. "Bless you, Coma, for now I will ever call you by&#xD;
that sweet name. Your decision has made me the happiest of&#xD;
mortals! But, oh! had it been against me, would I not have&#xD;
been the most wretched of men !"&#xD;
"Take care," said Coma, smiling amid her tears; "remem-&#xD;
ber I have not yet decided as to your first offence ; and if you&#xD;
are not more careful, sentence may yet go against you."&#xD;
"You may do with me as you please now, dear Coma; call&#xD;
me traitor, deceiver, flatterer, or anything else, so that you be-&#xD;
lieve me always true to you, and never reverse the decision&#xD;
you have now given, making me so supremely happy."&#xD;
"0 , you are incorrigible !" murmured Coma, looking kindly&#xD;
up into the eyes of her lover, "and to make you easy on that&#xD;
score, now that I am yours, I might as well tell you at once,&#xD;
so that you may not be too vain of your eloquence, that the&#xD;
decision I have just given was rendered last night, before you&#xD;
&#xD;

SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
were summoned to the dread tribunal, and before you had so&#xD;
feelingly pleaded your prejudged cause."&#xD;
" How so, dear Coma ? My heart has long been yours; but,&#xD;
oh ! had I known last night that you had one thought of return-&#xD;
ing my burning love, it would have saved me many, very many&#xD;
fears and doubts. But tell me, dear, how last night, rather&#xD;
than any other time, did you discover that this precious boon,&#xD;
so coveted and sought by me, was already mine."&#xD;
Sittingupon the moss-covered seat to which her lover had&#xD;
led her, close to the overhanging bank of the bright Yadkin,&#xD;
Coma gave an artless account of the occurrence of the night&#xD;
previous, showing that, by Montlack pressing his suit, and&#xD;
drawing the distinction between love and cousinly affection,&#xD;
she herself had been'led to think, and had discovered that her&#xD;
heart belonged to another.&#xD;
" And think you," said Bryan, by no means satisfied with&#xD;
Montlack's admiration of Coma, for he was already a victim of&#xD;
the green-eyed monster, "that this cousin of yours will sur-&#xD;
render up your hand without a struggle?  I fear he has the&#xD;
good-will of your father, and, having it, he will yet strive to&#xD;
tear from my grasp the rich prize I have wooed and won."&#xD;
"Fear not for my heart and my love, Bryan, for they are&#xD;
yours, and yours only," murmured Coma, confidingly; "and&#xD;
as for Cousin Jean, he has ever been kind and good, and I&#xD;
doubt not, when he discovers that the happiness of his little&#xD;
Coma, as he calls me, is at stake, that he will submit, and sub-&#xD;
mit bravely to his loss, if he'considers my poor hand worthy&#xD;
of a thought; and, moreover, for my sake will love you almost&#xD;
as much as I do."&#xD;
" And your father," muttered the lover, still desponding,&#xD;
" will he so readily give up his long-cherished plan of continu.&#xD;
ing his name and estate in the family by uniting yourself and&#xD;
cousin ?"&#xD;
" Ah, my father!" sighed Coma; almost as desponding as&#xD;
Bryan, whilst her face, but a moment since blooming with&#xD;
blushes, lost all its roses; "in my joy I had forgotten him.&#xD;

36&#xD;
&#xD;
.1&#xD;
Vy.-&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.             37&#xD;
But he loves me," she continued, after a minute of agitated&#xD;
thought, "and he loves his ancient name, too, as much if not&#xD;
more than his Coma; and I fear we shall meet with opposition&#xD;
from him. If, perchance, his promise has been given to Jean,&#xD;
then will all hope of his consent to our union be desperate.&#xD;
He is proud of his name, very proud, Bryan; and the thought&#xD;
of my marriage is the principal cart of his life. But why fear&#xD;
or tremble ?" she addedin a mcgre confident tone, looking&#xD;
proudly upon the elegant person of her lover, "for I am sure&#xD;
you are worthy to bear the honors of the proudest family that&#xD;
ever bore banner under the lilies of France, and can boast,&#xD;
perhaps, of ancestors as noble as our own."&#xD;
"I am an orphan, Coma," said Bryan, sadly but proudly,&#xD;
"and know nothing of my ancestry beyond my father."&#xD;
"Sure he was noble and good."&#xD;
" A colonel in the American army ; he was killed at Guil-&#xD;
ford, battling gloriously for liberty; and for honor, bravery, and&#xD;
patriotism," said the son feelingly, "I will acknowledge no&#xD;
man, I care not how ancient his name or family, his superior.&#xD;
. The memory of his glorious death is the only legacy he was&#xD;
able to leave his orphan son, and I treasure it more than if he&#xD;
had transmitted me boundless wealth."&#xD;
" And I, too I" exclaimed Coma, a tear of sympathy dancing&#xD;
in her bright eye. "The proudest of the proud, Bryan, cannot&#xD;
boast of ancestors more noble than thine; and I feel that&#xD;
my father, proud though he be, will feel honored to grasp by&#xD;
the hand the son of one of his old companions in arms."&#xD;
" But I am poor, very poor," said Bryan, still desponding,&#xD;
though greatly cheered by the rich encomium lavished upon&#xD;
the moory of his dead father by the sympathizing Coma.&#xD;
S"Poverty is not considered by my father," replied Coma,&#xD;
encouragingly. "Remember that Montlack has no estate, and&#xD;
yet my father seemed pleased with his attention to me."&#xD;
"True!I" exclaimed Bryan, his face once more brightening,&#xD;
and speaking now in a cheerful, hopeful voice ; "and if it was,&#xD;
you know, Coma, that we are both young; and with such a&#xD;

prize held up before me, I could soon hew out a fortune in the&#xD;
rich valleys of the West, and come back to lay it at your feet,&#xD;
and claim you as my own. Even now I have some thousand&#xD;
dollars, the remnant of my father's estate after furnishing me&#xD;
with an education; and no later than last night, Sergeant&#xD;
Duffe, my foster-father, and Sharp-Eye, an old follower of my&#xD;
father aid experienced borderer, but lately returned from Ken-&#xD;
tucky, were pressing me to go with them West; and I only&#xD;
delayed my answer until I had had this meeting with you."&#xD;
"If you love me, Bryan !" exclaimed Coma, with frightened&#xD;
earnestness, the rich blood deserting her countenance, and flow-&#xD;
ing back upon her trembling heart, "do not think of going to&#xD;
that horrid land! Why, it is already called the 'Dark and&#xD;
Bloody -Ground,' and not without reason, for we hear of nothing,&#xD;
from there but of blood, and massacre, and Indian deprcdi-&#xD;
tions! Oh! if you should only go there, then would I put on&#xD;
my widow weeds at once, and mourn you as dead, for I would&#xD;
never expect to see you again, and would ever remain in agony&#xD;
and doubt."&#xD;
"Calm your fears, dear Coma," murmured the lover, caress-&#xD;
ing tenderly the weeping girl by his side; "the daughter of a&#xD;
soldier and son of one should not tremble at danger, or grow&#xD;
alarmed at imaginary perils. Sharp-Eye praises the country&#xD;
as the most- lovely one on earth, and speaks of fortunes to be&#xD;
made there without trouble or labor, and of the Indian depre-&#xD;
dations as only frequent enough to keep up a proper spirit of&#xD;
chivalry."&#xD;
"But promise me, Bryan," said Coma, soothed by his&#xD;
caresses and cheering words, "that you will not go W-t until&#xD;
you have seen my father, and heard from his own Ips our&#xD;
fate."&#xD;
" Most willingly; for I intend soon to lay my claim to your&#xD;
hand before your father. I would know my doom at once, be&#xD;
it to make me the happiest or most miserable of mortals."&#xD;
"Fearinot; Bryan," murmured Coma, with a cheerful snile&#xD;
of#&amp;amp;ssurance, " for I am confident that wealth is no object with&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.             39&#xD;

"Will be of d-n little avail in this case," muttered a hoarse&#xD;
voice from underneath the overhanging bank upon which they&#xD;
were sitting, interrupting her in the very midst of-her hopeful&#xD;
anticipations.&#xD;
A low scream of terror from Coma followed this unexpected&#xD;
and, in her mind, ominous interruption; but Bryan, gently&#xD;
removing the hand that in alarm had seized upon his arm,&#xD;
dashed forward to the extreme verge of the bank, but only in&#xD;
time to see the burly form of the eavesdropper as he rounded&#xD;
a point some distance down the river.&#xD;
His first thought was to pursue the bold spy; but noticing&#xD;
the extreme- terror of Coma, he gave up this design and re-&#xD;
turned to her side, attempting to calm her agitation by laugh-&#xD;
ingly saying that it was some passing fisherman who had fallen&#xD;
upon this plan to let them know they had a listener.&#xD;
But Coma had been too much alarmed by this inauspicious&#xD;
interruption of her hopeful imaginings, seemingly in answer to&#xD;
her own thoughts, to be thus soothed. She insisted upon re-&#xD;
turning home at once, and the lover, after receiving her promise&#xD;
to meet him again, escorted her beyond all fear of danger, and&#xD;
took his leave.&#xD;
CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
CAPTAIN JEAN had, spent a miserable day. In vain had&#xD;
been all his endeavors to discover the name and abode (for he&#xD;
was confident he had one) of his rival. Although he had rid-&#xD;
den over to Hl-..-.-., and in a quiet way made many inquiries,&#xD;
he had as yet met with ibut poor success;. so much so that he&#xD;
began to grow encouraged, and thought that perhaps he had&#xD;

been too hasty in his suspicions, and, after all, that Coma's&#xD;
coldness was nothing more than a maidenly whim. Consoled&#xD;
no little by this conclusion, the sage captain was now on his&#xD;
return home, and with his mind fully made up to press his suit&#xD;
vigorously, and know, without delay, the position he held in&#xD;
the heart of his cousin. -He was fully determined on one thing,&#xD;
and that was not to give up without a desperate struggle his&#xD;
brilliant scheme of transferring the immense estate of De Lacy&#xD;
to himself; and now, as he rode leisurely along the bank of&#xD;
the Yadkin, filled with this pleasant fancy, he ever and anon&#xD;
would stop, and, with a smile of secret satisfaction, survey the&#xD;
broad lands stretching out around him, imagining them, no&#xD;
doubt, as already his own, and along with them the pretty per-&#xD;
son of his beautiful cousin.. As if cheered by his imaginary&#xD;
honors and wealth, the captain touched his horse lightly, and,&#xD;
galloping forward, forgot, for the time, his jealous fears and&#xD;
troubles, whilst he hummed, with artistic skill, a sprightly&#xD;
French air.&#xD;
But suddenly the pleasant reveries of Captain Jean were in-&#xD;
terrupted by a low, meaning hiss, and turning his head quickly&#xD;
to know the cause of challenge, he found himself, and apparently&#xD;
to his no small surprise, confronted by the burly form of the&#xD;
spy, the same that had watched at the house of Duffe, and, con-&#xD;
cealed under the overhanging bank of the Yadkin, had listened&#xD;
to and interrupted the conversation of the lovers.&#xD;
"Sacre!" exclaimed Montlack, drawing in his horse with a&#xD;
sudden jerk, and with evident marks of trepidation about his&#xD;
face, " Is that you, Girty? Why, I thought the devil had you&#xD;
long ago !"&#xD;
" May-be you only hoped so?" muttered the renegade with a&#xD;
meaning laugh.&#xD;
"But what brought you back into this neighborhood, Girty ?"&#xD;
". Call me Brant, for the present," said Girty in a surly tone,&#xD;
although with an evident attempt at pleasantry, " for there is&#xD;
one about here, if he does not know my face, has heard the&#xD;
name of Simon Girty very often of late years, and not always&#xD;

&#xD;
mentioned in the most honorable manner. As for the devil&#xD;
having me, Captain Jean," he added, with a harsh chuckle, "he&#xD;
has had many pretty'fair chances of calling me his own; but&#xD;
thanks to my good luck, as yet I have slipped through his&#xD;
fingers, and am here now, as you see, and without any ghostly&#xD;
signs about me, standing in the presence of your honor."&#xD;
With this speech, Girty, or Brant, raising his ragged,&#xD;
weather-beaten hat, with a grim, insolent smile, made a, low,&#xD;
half mocking bow to the captain.&#xD;
Montlack's countenance showed very plainly that he was by&#xD;
no means delighted at this renewal of acquaintance with the&#xD;
renegade; but putting on a bold'-front, he exclaimed, "Holio,&#xD;
Simon! that rascally countenance of yours does not add much&#xD;
to the beauty of the landscape, and if I am not greatly mis-&#xD;
taken, there was once a contract between us (and for a valuable&#xD;
consideration, which you have received) that I should never&#xD;
again be troubled with your~ honest company?"&#xD;
" With Mr. Girty, it is true there was some such contract,"&#xD;
replied the renegade with a sneer; "but you must remember,&#xD;
captain, that you are now honored with the presence of Mr.&#xD;
Joseph Brant, quite a different person altogether, a poor, hard-&#xD;
working fisherman, but a very honest; respectable man, and one&#xD;
that can boast many heavy scars, received in the defence of his&#xD;
country."&#xD;
As Mr. Brant made this defence of his respectability, and&#xD;
proved in so conclusive a manner the difference between the&#xD;
party referred to by Montlack and himself, he once more raised&#xD;
his ragged hat, and, stepping a few paces nearer the captain,&#xD;
pointed significantly to a broad scar across his face, saying,'&#xD;
" This will go a long way, captain, in making an honest face&#xD;
of one that you have heretofore been in the habit of consider-&#xD;
ing quite the contrary. . Eh! do you take ?"&#xD;
" True," said Montlack with more ease, now that he had&#xD;
caught the drift of the outlaw's remark, and felt the impro-&#xD;
bability of his being recognized as Simon Girty, "that scar&#xD;
does make a change in the outlines of your lovely face; and&#xD;

&#xD;
now that I examine it more closely, I can see that the sun has&#xD;
been looking down very freely upon your fair countenance since&#xD;
last we met, and has given it rather a more dusky hue. I ask&#xD;
pardon, Mr. Brant," he. continued, with a forced laugh, dis-&#xD;
mounting from his horse, and extending his hand to the rene-&#xD;
gade, "for taking you for my old friend Simon Girty."&#xD;
"Good !" replied the outlaw, with a coarse laugh and oath,&#xD;
grasping the extended hand of Montlack. "I find, captain,&#xD;
you can take a hint as readily as ever. But sit down and let's&#xD;
have a little chat about old times."&#xD;
At first, MOntlack had been somewhat startled, and no little&#xD;
annoyed at the unexpected appearance of the outlaw, for on&#xD;
account of Girty's knowledge of certain events that the captain&#xD;
would fain have buried, the latter, at the expense of a large&#xD;
sum, had purchased the departure of that worthy from the coun-&#xD;
try, and as several years had elapsed since this contract, he&#xD;
had hoped that he was forever clear of him. But now that&#xD;
Girty had again turned up, the captain considered it most&#xD;
politic not to show any great uneasiness or anger, and ,indeed&#xD;
began to think that the meeting, after all, was rather opportune&#xD;
than otherwise; for, in his present difficulties, he, the captain,&#xD;
might need the services of so ready and unscrupulous an ally.&#xD;
Without more ado, then, the cunning Jean, all traces of vexa-&#xD;
tion having vanished from his face, at once obeyed the outlaw's&#xD;
request to be seated, good-humoredly remarking: "Never mind&#xD;
the past, Monsieur Brant; we have had enough of it; and so let&#xD;
it, along with all our ancient troubles and rascalities, go to the&#xD;
devil. From report, Simon--I ask pardon, Mr. Brant-.I was&#xD;
led to believe that you were a great chief among the redskins ;&#xD;
but suppose, from your appearance here to-day, that this report,&#xD;
like most rumors, was false, and that you are thesame reckless,&#xD;
careless devil that you ever were,' always wanting money, and&#xD;
never having a cent. Eh, Simon !" continued the captain in-&#xD;
quiringly, and with some little alarm, for he had been a suf-&#xD;
ferer, "is it money that you are after now? or what has brought&#xD;
you back into this, for you, most dangerous country ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
42&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
YI&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
" Not more dangerous than the one I have left," said the&#xD;
outlaw, dryly; "but you were not so far wrong, after all, about&#xD;
my being a leader of the redskins; nor were you so vastly mis-&#xD;
taken," he added, with a cunning leer at Montlack, "about my&#xD;
being in want of money; but it was not the want of money&#xD;
alone that induced me to make this dangerous journey."&#xD;
" Then what was it ?" asked the captain, not in the most&#xD;
pleasant mood, for he bad lost his good-humor under the now&#xD;
certain belief that Girty intended to make another draw upon&#xD;
his purse, and that too upon a past consideration, already, as&#xD;
he thought, most amply satisfied.&#xD;
"What would you think," replied Brant, "if I were to say&#xD;
that it was a desire to see my old home and the familiar scenes&#xD;
of my youth ?"&#xD;
" I would think it a d-d lie !" retorted the captain, sur-&#xD;
lily.&#xD;
" "Yet it is so," replied the renegade gloomily; " I am a&#xD;
dark-souled villain, I admit-steeped in every crime of the-&#xD;
blackest dye; and have stooped to the lowest and darkest of&#xD;
sins to satisfy my longing after gold, or glut my ever-burning&#xD;
and ever-increasing desire for revenge upon my race. Still,&#xD;
captain, notwithstanding your sneer, with all my crimes and&#xD;
all my sins, though a chieftain of the bloodthirsty savage, and&#xD;
covered with the warm gore of the white settler of the West, I&#xD;
have had my hour of remorse, and my moments, too, of ardent&#xD;
longing to behold the home of my innocent youth, and mingle&#xD;
once more with those of my own color and tongue. It is the&#xD;
only pleasant memory I have," continued Girty, with some&#xD;
show of emotion, "the memory of my innocent childhood&#xD;
when, with father, and mother, and brother, I sported in these&#xD;
very woods, and fished in the bright waters of yonder shining&#xD;
river! Although you believe it not, captain, and are now&#xD;
laughing in your sleeve at the very thought of my having any&#xD;
feeling in common with other men, I tell you that this same&#xD;
memory of the patst, and longing to see my home, more than&#xD;

any desire or hope of gain, has induced me to make this peril-&#xD;

I see no reason to doubt your word," said Montlack, half&#xD;
mockingly; "but, from my past intercourse with you, I had&#xD;
thought you were not much troubled with love for the white&#xD;
race."&#xD;
"Nor am I," growled the outlaw between his clenched&#xD;
teeth. "Did not one of my accursed race, that stern Colonel&#xD;
Head, have me publicly whipped, in full view of my regiment,&#xD;
for a theft, of which I was guilty only under the influence of&#xD;
liquor?  But I had my revenge! And did not that blood-&#xD;
thirsty band of wild partisans murder my father and brothers,&#xD;
even down there, in that very cottage, where I am now hiding&#xD;
my disgraced head ?  Ay! ay! they did it, captain; but Simon&#xD;
Girty has had his revenge, if not upon the guilty, upon their&#xD;
accursed race."&#xD;
Surely, Simon," said Montlack, shuddering at the fiendish&#xD;
scowl upon the countenance of his companion, "you are not&#xD;
staying in that deserted cottage where your kindred were&#xD;
slain ?"&#xD;
Why not ?" asked the outlaw - coldly. "Can I not fold&#xD;
myself in my blanket, and fancy them all there, as they used&#xD;
to be, and have the pleasure of fancying myself back home&#xD;
again with my kindred? And when my mood changes, can I&#xD;
not behold again their gory, bullet-pierced bodies, and dream&#xD;
of sweet and terrible revenge? - Oh ho! captain," laughed the.&#xD;
dark-browed murderer, with hellish glee, "you don't know the&#xD;
luxury of one night's sleep in that ruined cottage ! I have&#xD;
strange fancies and curious dreams as I lay there, all alone, by&#xD;
the desolate hearth-stone of my father! But that's neither&#xD;
here nor there," added Girty, his mood and tone' changing&#xD;
suddenly; "and you have no interest in it; so we will pass on:&#xD;
to something that, I doubt not, will excite your honor's atten-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"What is it ?" said the captain, and, his mind still running&#xD;
upon the expected demand of the renegade for money, he&#xD;
&#xD;
added,i"Do you want more money, notwithstanding your con-&#xD;
ract to let me alone and leave the country forever ?"&#xD;
"I want money; that's it, captain," replied the outlaw,&#xD;
smiling at Montlack's quick divination of his wishes; "but,&#xD;
remember, I am no longer Simon Girty, but Joseph Brant,&#xD;
an will, therefore, release now and forever all claims for past&#xD;
services, making my demands only in proportion to services,&#xD;
now rendered, and to be rendered."&#xD;
"That's fair !" exclaimed Montlack, at once regaining his&#xD;
good-humor, "and here's my hand on all future contracts."&#xD;
c"Have I not always dealt fairly with you?" said the rene-&#xD;
gade, sulkily.&#xD;
"I must say, Simon, that I have never found you otherwise;&#xD;
though, to tell the truth, I feared a little, just now, that you&#xD;
were going to press me on the old score."&#xD;
wefirst fears removed by the generous proposal of the re-&#xD;
negade to drop all claims for past services, the. captain's mind&#xD;
reverted at once to the subject of his thoughts when interrupted&#xD;
by the "hist" of Girty, and, without thinking of the advantage&#xD;
he would give his shrewd companin-by thus showing his in-&#xD;
terest in the matter of inquiry, he exclaimed:-&#xD;
"Come, Girty! tell me what's on hand, now?   Is it any-&#xD;
thing respecting the daughter of General De Lacy ?"&#xD;
"Exactly !" said Brant (for we will call him by this name,&#xD;
for the present), a radiant smile gleaming across his swart&#xD;
countenance, for he saw, and seized at once upon the advantage&#xD;
given him by the captain's impetuosity, "and a good deal,&#xD;
too, more than you think, provided my pay is in proportion to&#xD;
the value of my information."&#xD;
" Let's have it, then," said Montlack, eagerly; " for you&#xD;
know I am a good paymaster."&#xD;
" Better than those we had during the Revolution, when&#xD;
you can't help yourself !" growled the outlaw. " But we must&#xD;
come to some understanding, captain, before you get one word&#xD;
from me."&#xD;
'" How much do you demand ?" inquired Miontlack, endea-&#xD;

voring to put on a careless look, and thus, if possible, do away&#xD;
with the advantage he had given his cunning companion; "I&#xD;
only feel interested about this cousin of mine, you know, on&#xD;
account of my uncle, who is anxious to save her from any un-&#xD;
equal match."&#xD;
"Ha! ha!" laughed Brant, "it won't do, captain! I'm too&#xD;
cunning for any such a trick as that ! , I tell you that you&#xD;
will have to come down on the heavy figures, or this cousin of&#xD;
yours, in whom you take so little interest, may marry the devil,&#xD;
for aught I care."&#xD;
"Then, in the devil's name," exclaimed the irritated cap-&#xD;
tain, finding that he was fairly caught, "let me hear what you&#xD;
demand !"&#xD;
"In the name of the devil, then, as you will lug him into&#xD;
our agreement," said Brant, with a laugh, " I ask for, and in&#xD;
consideration of my information, $500, and not one cent less&#xD;
will I take, and would not receive even that amount, if I could&#xD;
not, at the same time, revenge myself."&#xD;
"Ten thousand furies ! Simon, you must be mad, stark,&#xD;
raving mad!" exclaimed Montlack, " or you would never think&#xD;
of such a sum as that! 'I can't think of paying anysuch a&#xD;
price for a little trifling information about the maudlin love of&#xD;
a puling child !"&#xD;
" Mad or not," growled Brant, "that is the very lowest cent&#xD;
I will take; and if you don't see proper to give it, then there's&#xD;
no harm done, and we might as well part company at once.&#xD;
But you will rue your mistimed economy, captain; for this de-&#xD;
termination of yours will lose you the amount demanded a&#xD;
hundredfold over."&#xD;
"Then out with it," snarled Montlack; " for, if I must, I&#xD;
must, and the sooner you tell me all you know, the better.&#xD;
But, remember, Mr. Simon, I'll have no trifling ; for, if I pay&#xD;
you well, I must get value received."&#xD;
"So be it," said Brant, carelessly; ''I know the importance&#xD;
of my information, and, for this reason, have claimed the&#xD;

reward you are pleased to consider so exorbitant. Do you&#xD;
remember Colonel Head, captain ?"&#xD;
"D-n Colonel Head !" shouted Montlack, in a furious tone,&#xD;
at this inquiry of the renegade; "let bygones be bygones, and&#xD;
don't be troubling me with these old matters. You have been&#xD;
paid for them."&#xD;
a You recollect, captain," continued the outlaw, with pro-&#xD;
voking coolness, "how you used to carry on a nice little cor-&#xD;
respondence with the English general in the name of our&#xD;
colonel, and the lots of good English gold we received in re-&#xD;
turn; and how, after that- disgraceful punishment of mine, I&#xD;
managed to let one of your sweet epistles fall-into the hands of&#xD;
General Greene; and how my brave colonel was, if not dis-&#xD;
graced, very greatly suspected, and) to save his honor, commit-&#xD;
ted suicide, by rushing madly upon the bayonets of the enemy&#xD;
at Guilford Court-House-?  Eh I captain, you haven't forgotten&#xD;
it?"&#xD;
During this provoking retrospect of the renegade, the cap-&#xD;
tain stood trembling with rage, and, when he had finished, no&#xD;
longer able to restrain his anger, exclaimed&#xD;
H--11 and fury, Simon ! you are pushing your impudence&#xD;
beyond endurance. What has all. this rigmarole concerning&#xD;
Colonel Head to do with my cousin Coma, and the matter&#xD;
now on hand?"&#xD;
" A good deal, as you will soon learn," replied Brant, with&#xD;
annoying calmness.&#xD;
Nontlack made a gesture of impatience, and the outlaw&#xD;
added-&#xD;
" A son of that same Colonel Head is in love with your fair&#xD;
cousin."-&#xD;
"Damnation1" hissed the captain.&#xD;
" And what is still better," growled Brant,- enjoying his evi-&#xD;
dent discomfiture, "your cousin is in love with him."&#xD;
Montlack stared with amazement.&#xD;
" And what is better still," added Brant, with marked em-&#xD;
phasis, " they have plighited to each other their vows of love."&#xD;

&#xD;
Montlack made no reply, merely motioning him to go on.&#xD;
" And what is a great. deal better," laughed. Brant, with&#xD;
fiendish glee, "this sweet cousin of yours told her lover that&#xD;
she knew her kind cousin Jean was in love with her, but that&#xD;
he was a good, clever fellow, and when he discovered that her&#xD;
happiness was at stake-remember that, captain-that he&#xD;
would resign all claim to her hand, and aid them, like a dear,&#xD;
kind soul that he was, in gaining the consent of her father!&#xD;
Ha ! ha! how like you that, my dear captain ?"&#xD;
" Sacr!  You will run me mad," howled the outraged cap-&#xD;
tain, clasping his brow in agony, and dancing around in the&#xD;
excess of his fury.&#xD;
" Come, captain, don't be in a pet," urged the renegade,&#xD;
badgeringly. " Just walk up, like a good, kind cousin that&#xD;
you are, and say: ' My much loved and much esteemed uncle,&#xD;
the happiness of dear Coma is at stake; don't hesitate a mo-&#xD;
ment, but give her over at once to this agreeable Mr. Head,&#xD;
and along with her just transfer her these broad lands, for he&#xD;
has noble blood, and is directly descended (don't forget that)&#xD;
from the honorable and unimpeachable Colonel Head, so un-&#xD;
justly suspected of being a spy.' "-&#xD;
"The $500 is yours, Simon," said Montlack, the cloud roll'-&#xD;
ing back from his cunning countenance; "and I thank you&#xD;
for that hint respecting the noble colonel, for with th e general&#xD;
his being the son of Head is enough, and more than enough,&#xD;
of itself to play the devil with this. young fellow and his high-&#xD;
wrought hopes.  But come, Simon, my fury needs no en-&#xD;
couragement ; so out with how you obtained all this informa-&#xD;
tion, and then, if you will aid me in taking my revenge, and&#xD;
in putting a stop to the romantic love of these young fools, I&#xD;
will make the $500 a $1000."&#xD;
" Just what I expected," said Brant; and then, without de-&#xD;
lay, he gave the astonished captain a minute account of all&#xD;
that he had overheard at the house of Duffe, and under the&#xD;
bank of the river, not forgetting, in the conclusion of his nar-&#xD;
rative, poor Coma's eulogy of Montlack, and her expressed hope&#xD;

overcome the opposition of her father.&#xD;
0      t yes!" grinned the furious captain, "I will be his very&#xD;
dear friend, and aid him in his suit with a vengeance. This&#xD;
cousin of mine was not mistaken in her estimation of my heart.&#xD;
Eh, Simon?"&#xD;
. The renegade laughed, adding, with a sneer-&#xD;
"To be sure you will; for I was thinking myself, while&#xD;
listening to their pleasant arrangements to strip you of ypur&#xD;
uncle's estate, how much you would be delighted, and how well&#xD;
your cousin knew Captain Jean Montlack. But, joking aside,&#xD;
what are you going to do ?"&#xD;
cI haven't made up my mind yet," said Montlack, doubt-&#xD;
ingly -,"but suppose the best thing I can do will be to inform&#xD;
the general at once of .the name and family of his iended&#xD;
son-in-law."&#xD;
"Not at all," replied Brant, "for I've been thinking over&#xD;
this matter, and came to the conclusion that it would be fine&#xD;
fun for you to humor them awhile, and pretend that you are the&#xD;
kind, good cousin they believe you; and then, when they sup-&#xD;
pose everything arranged, just give the old general a sly ink-&#xD;
ling of the honorable parentage of this fine youth, and have&#xD;
him kicked out of doors, or dragged in the horsepond, for his&#xD;
presumption."&#xD;
" Good!1" exclaimed Montlack, with undisguised satisfaction.&#xD;
"ICan you give me any further advice, my dear Mentor?"&#xD;
" Of course I can," said the renegade, in the same pleasant&#xD;
vein; "for I hav'n't thought over this matter for nothing, and&#xD;
think I know a fine plan to settle this good youth for some time&#xD;
to come."&#xD;
"Let's have it. I know in advance that it will do, for you&#xD;
were always good at scheming, Simon."&#xD;
"Suppose, then, that, during these loving days, when you&#xD;
are playing the kind cousin, you manage 'to borrow from this&#xD;
open-hearted, unsuspecting lover-no very difficult business, I&#xD;
should think--a thousand dollars; and then, when the general&#xD;

has driven him away in disgrace, this sweet youth, the son of&#xD;
my old enemy, will have the additional comfort of knowing&#xD;
that he has not only lost his sweetheart, but for a time his&#xD;
money, and is a beggar; for I heard him say that this sum and&#xD;
the proud name of his father," added the renegade, with a&#xD;
mocking laugh, "was his "only heritage."&#xD;
" Better and better," responded the cunning captain, catch.&#xD;
ing at once his companion's fiendish plan. " But when he re-&#xD;
ceives his dismissal, and calls on me for payment," he added,&#xD;
looking inquiringly into the eyes of Brant, "what then ?"&#xD;
"07' replied the outlaw, with a devilish and knowing leer&#xD;
at Montlack, "'we can manage that. I guessed it wouldn't be&#xD;
convenient for you to pay over, for I intend 'to take this thou-&#xD;
sand myself, and have arranged it, therefore, that you shall&#xD;
never suffer."&#xD;
" But how, my wise Simon? Have you learned some Indian.&#xD;
trick to avoid the payment of a just debt ? for, if you have, I&#xD;
will add another thousand for the grand discovery, and make&#xD;
my own fortune by retailing out to needy debtors this glorious&#xD;
panacea for all their troubles."&#xD;
" What say you to serving him somewhat in the manner we&#xD;
did his father? Just deny the obligation, and charge him with&#xD;
forgery. I think it would work admirably," laughed Brant;-&#xD;
"for you can change your signature when, with honest zeal,&#xD;
you force him to receive your written bond, all business-like,&#xD;
you know; and it will be devilish strange if, with your standing&#xD;
in society,, backed by my evidence if necessary, we cannot&#xD;
brand the simpleton with forgery; and then, if he will not ,&#xD;
peaceably give up the hand of Miss Coma,. you can save your-&#xD;
self all further trouble, so far as he is concerned, by delivering&#xD;
him over into the power of the law. - Eh, captain? Here's a&#xD;
dodge worth a thousand-isn't it ?"&#xD;
"I believe it will answer," said Montlack, musingly. "Yes,&#xD;
I know it will," he added, in a more satisfied tone, after a mo-&#xD;
ment of thought; "and I can in this way not only save myself&#xD;
from all interruption on his part, but, what is still better, in a&#xD;
&#xD;
Of, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.              51.&#xD;
case like this, forever damn him in the estimation of Coma her-&#xD;
self."&#xD;
"Of course," replied Brant, positively. "And remember,&#xD;
captain," he added, encouragingly, "you -are working for a noble&#xD;
stake, for the hand of your lovely cousin is worthy of the strug-&#xD;
gle, without counting her broad acres."&#xD;
" May the devil take me if I don't try it!" exclaimed Mont-&#xD;
lack, springing to his feet; « and if we succeed, Simon, the thou-&#xD;
sand dollars borrowed from him shall be yours."&#xD;
"It's a bargain," replied the renegade; "and I am as sure&#xD;
of that thousand as if I had it here now in my pocket."&#xD;
" Bon soir, Monsieur Brant!" exclaimed Montlack, mount-&#xD;
ing his horse. ."I must away, now, to gather up my wits for&#xD;
the struggle. I suppose, when I need your services, I will&#xD;
always find you at the old cottage ?"&#xD;
" Exactly, and always alone; for the good people hereabouts&#xD;
are too much afraid of ghosts ever to visit my tumbledown re-&#xD;
treat. But remember, captain, Simon Girty is never at home,&#xD;
and you must inquire for Mr. Brant, for he will answer just as&#xD;
well."&#xD;
"Never fear; I won't forget," returned Montlack, putting&#xD;
spurs to his horse, and galloping away.&#xD;
The renegade did not remain long behind; but, after watch-&#xD;
ing the captain until he was out of sight, turned off from the&#xD;
road, and walked slowly away in the direction of the deserted&#xD;
cottage.&#xD;
He had scarcely gone a minute when Sharp-Eye, raising his&#xD;
person from behind a rock not more than a hundred paces dis-&#xD;
tant, muttered to himself, as he followed with his eye the re-&#xD;
treating form of Girty:-&#xD;
"Well, blast my eyes if I wouldn't give a hundred beaver-&#xD;

about ! Cuss that feller with the bushy red head and big scar;&#xD;

ing his head wisely; " I've trailed that ar' rascal from the&#xD;

cause of all this spyin', and eavesdroppin', and powwowin', or&#xD;
my name ain't Sharp-Eye. And this 'ere smooth-tongue&#xD;
captain, he's worse than a lyin' Mingo, for I know'd him of&#xD;
old; and blast me if I ever know'd any good of him! He's&#xD;
-one of them parley-vooin' Frenchmen, and drat me if I ever&#xD;
thought-much of any of them, nohow, though they did come&#xD;
over and help us fight the Britishers ! We could have jist&#xD;
walloped the redcoats anyhow, and without them Frenchmen;&#xD;
and I'm darned sorry the frog-eating devils ever had any hand&#xD;
in the scrimmage ! I wouldn't be surprised now, since this&#xD;
'ternal captain has a finger in the pie, if Mr. Bryan and that&#xD;
ar' pretty gal of the squire's hadn't somethin' to do with this&#xD;
'ere big talk. But never mind, Mr. Parley-voo and Mr. Red-&#xD;
head, you sha'n't have it al your own way. Sharp-Eye is on&#xD;
the trail; and it will be darnation strange if we don't smell 'em&#xD;
out yet--won't it, Bang ?"&#xD;
Bang, as if conscious of being in a dangerous neighborhood,&#xD;
gave his assent, with a low growl, to this query of the Scout;&#xD;
and soon after, master and dog, moving off in an opposite&#xD;
course to that taken by the renegade, were alike lost in the&#xD;
Woods.&#xD;
CHAPTER V.&#xD;
GENERAL DE LACY, the captain, and Coma were again in&#xD;
the parlor of the former. It was night-the night following&#xD;
the Meeting of Montlack and Girty.&#xD;
The'party were occupied in very much the same manner as&#xD;
when first introduced to the reader, save that Montlack, for&#xD;
the last half hour, had sat alone by a window, busy with his&#xD;
&#xD;
OR) THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.              53&#xD;
own treacherous thoughts; arranging and marshalling his dark&#xD;
legions to attack and deceive the guileless and artless heart of&#xD;
his unsuspecting cousin.&#xD;
The wicked and false frequently deceive and victimize the&#xD;
truthful and good: but it is not so easy a contest as one would&#xD;
imagine; and frequently, very frequently, the artless, without&#xD;
intending it, overthrow the 'most skilful plans of the artful;&#xD;
leaving then like a general who, in attempting to surprise his&#xD;
opponent, is himself, without understanding exactly how, sur-&#xD;
prised and defeated.&#xD;
Montlack had mingled much with the world, both the good&#xD;
and the bad of it, was a skilful reader of the heart, and well&#xD;
knew how to manage it to meet his own purposes; but with all&#xD;
his wicked cunning and daring, he was at loss now how to&#xD;
attack the pure heart of the maiden before him, so as to bend&#xD;
it to his own designs, and, at the same time, conceal his treache-&#xD;
rous intentions. The way of the wicked is always hard, and&#xD;
the web of the false and traitorous eyer liable to be broken;&#xD;
Montlack felt, that it was so, but nerved himself for the con-&#xD;
test. He was aware of the difficulty of his present position ;&#xD;
knod+ing that he must be cunning and artful indeed- so to&#xD;
deceive Coma as to work out his plan of destroying her love&#xD;
and the character of her lover, and yet remain in her eyes the&#xD;
same good and kind friend she imagined him.&#xD;
But he had determined upon the effort; and now, like a&#xD;
skilful tactician, drew his chair to her side, murmuring, in a&#xD;
low tone, "(There was a time once, Coma, when you concealed&#xD;
nothing from your cousin Jean, but laid open to him your&#xD;
heart, and ever had in him a sympathizing friend. Have you&#xD;
discovered him less sympathizing of late; or less worthy of&#xD;
your confidence ?"&#xD;
The captain's voice was low and melancholy, and he spoke&#xD;
with 'such a tone of sorrow, and was apparently so deeply&#xD;
wounded at the very thought of having lost her confidence,&#xD;
that Coma, affected, replied quickly, and with evident emo-&#xD;
tion, "You deceive yourself, dear Jean, indeed you do; for I&#xD;
5*&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8248-00000029"/>&#xD;
54                  SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
have as much confidence in your kindness and affection now as&#xD;
I ever did; and if I have said or done anything to wound your&#xD;
feelings, you must forgive me, for it was not so intended."&#xD;
"Then, why conceal from  me the cause of your recent&#xD;
abstraction, and, I might add, coldness towards myself?"&#xD;
Coma blushed, but made no reply.&#xD;
"You well know, dear Coma," continued Montlack, appa-&#xD;
rently not noticing her confusion, "my deep affection, and, as&#xD;
I hinted last night, ardent love for you. But don't start; for&#xD;
you need not fear my recurring to that painful subject again.&#xD;
It was a bitter struggle, Coma, to feel that I had loved, loved&#xD;
so long--but loved in vain; and that that heart I had so long&#xD;
coveted, and hoped to call my own, was never to be mine, but&#xD;
was already given to another. But I knew at once, from your&#xD;
blushes and change of manner, that it was- so; and determined,&#xD;
though it might break my own heart, that I would suffer in&#xD;
silence, and never bring a care upon your brow by pressing&#xD;
my unreciprocated love. Yet, Coma, although this has been,&#xD;
one of the sorest trials of my life, how my heart bled to-day,&#xD;
when I accidentally discovered that you had not only given your&#xD;
love to another, for which I could not blame you, but had con.&#xD;
cealed it from me--thus proving that you had lost all confi-&#xD;
dence and trust in a heart that would willingly give its last&#xD;
drop of blood to insure your happiness-! Was this like you,&#xD;
Coma? And was it right ?--was it not cruel in you thus to&#xD;
treat an old friend and cousin ?"&#xD;
"Forgive me, Jean, that I ever hesitated to tell you all!"&#xD;
exclaimed the deceived girl, while tears of compassion and'&#xD;
admiration rolled down her blushing cheeks. "You were ever&#xD;
good, and noble, and without deceit, Jean; and I know you&#xD;
i11 believe me when I say that it was not from want of con-&#xD;
fidence that I remained silent. Remember my maiden modesty,&#xD;
and I am satisfied you will forgive me."&#xD;
"I believe you, Coma; for there is neither sin nor deceit in&#xD;
your pure hear(; and I love you too well not \to forgive."&#xD;
Montlack, as if to show the sincerity of the pardon granted,&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.        55&#xD;
&#xD;
took the unresisting hand of his cousin in his own; and, press-&#xD;
ing it respectfully to his lips, added, in a more cheerful tone,&#xD;
"There, now, we are friends again. I have kissed your hand&#xD;
as did the serfs of old-a mark of my bondage; and hence-&#xD;
forth you may count me your slave, ready to obey all your&#xD;
behests."&#xD;
" And my first command is that you be to me, as you have&#xD;
ever been, my dear cousin, ready to aid me in the hour of&#xD;
trouble, and sympathize with me in my moments of distress."&#xD;
"'Try me, Coma; and you will find me ever ready and will-&#xD;
ing, and, I trust, worthy."&#xD;
" As a mark, then, of my renewed trust," said Coma, blush-&#xD;
ing deeply, "1we will talk of him to whom I have given my&#xD;
love. But, oh ! Jean,-if this subject be at all distasteful or&#xD;
wounding to your noble and generous heart, say so at once;&#xD;
and never, never shall one word of mine bring a pang to your&#xD;
magnanimous heart !&#xD;
"I have made up my mind, and schooled my heart to the&#xD;
sacrifice, Coma," replied Montlack, with a desperate effort&#xD;
smothering his rage, and assuming a sorrowful tone; "and now,&#xD;
if you hesitate a moment in telling me all your plans, and all&#xD;
your hopes, and fears, and even your love-for why should I&#xD;
halt at that little word, so dear to others, although so dreadful&#xD;
to me?--.I will doubt your promised -confidence in my sin-&#xD;
cerity, and have but little to sustain me in my sad trial.&#xD;
Coma," he continued, more cheerfully, " tell me all your plans,&#xD;
what you design to do, and"what part you wish me to play.&#xD;
If I cannot be happy.myself, I would make you so."&#xD;
" I suppose you know his name ?" asked Coma, hesitatingly,&#xD;
as if in doubt how much he did know.&#xD;
" The honest fisherman," answered Montlack, evasively,&#xD;
" who overheard your conversation, and was on his way, in&#xD;
hopes of a reward for his news, to inform the general, when he&#xD;
was met by myself, only knew of your love and engagement,&#xD;
and was entirely ignorant of the name of your lover."&#xD;
"Oh ho, Captain Jean !" laughed Coma, "in my simpli-&#xD;

city -I was about numbering you among the scouts or wizards&#xD;
of the land; but discover that you have found out my secret in&#xD;
a very common and simple manner; you must therefore sink&#xD;
in my estimation, for you have lost all your wonderful powers,&#xD;
and stand before me like any other of mortal mould. But&#xD;
I thank you for stopping this water-god, or rather fishy eaves-&#xD;
dropper, on his way to my father. This story, told too sud-&#xD;
denly, and without any preparation on our part, might have&#xD;
raised a very uncomfortable storm about our ears."&#xD;
" So I thought," said the captain, glancing at the general,&#xD;
who was sitting in a distant part of the room, intensely inte-&#xD;
rested (as of late was usual with him) in an account of the&#xD;
revolutionary movements of Europe.&#xD;
With many blushes and frequent hesitation, Coma, in a low&#xD;
voice, with ever and anon an uneasy look in the direction of&#xD;
her father, narrated to the captain, who listened apparently,&#xD;
with the greatest attention, the whole history of her love, from&#xD;
her first meeting with Bryan to their engagement and parting&#xD;
on the morning previous; to all of which the treacherous&#xD;
Montlack lent a willing ear, and, when she had. concluded, re-.&#xD;
marked:--&#xD;
"I have no doubt, Coma, he is all you believe him, and, for&#xD;
your sake, trust he is worthy of the invaluable boon you have&#xD;
given him; but he must not.see the general before I have seen&#xD;
him, or before I have prepared the way, with your father, for&#xD;
this meeting.. He may destroy all our plans by too much&#xD;
haste."&#xD;
" You can easily see him, Jean," replied Coma, completely&#xD;
deceived by the kindly interest Montlack seemed to take in the&#xD;
matter, and falling at once into the snare he had set for her,&#xD;
" by riding over to Sergeant IDuffe's. I feel," continued the&#xD;
fair girl, proudly, "that, when you once see and know him,&#xD;
and learn his goodness and gentleness of heart, you will trans-&#xD;
fer to him, dear Jean, some of the affection you bear your&#xD;
cousin."&#xD;
"No doubt ! no doubt !" muttered MVontlack, hastily, scarcely&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.              57&#xD;
concealing a sneer, for it was as much as even his hypocritical&#xD;
heart, ascunning and determined as it was, could now do to&#xD;
restrain a burst of anger; but, by a mighty effort, he did so,&#xD;
and with a smile as deceitful as the sunny, alluring dimple&#xD;
upon the cheek of a heartless coquette, he added:&#xD;
"I will go early on to-morrow; but you must prepare me a&#xD;
nice little billet-doux, Coma, with full powers to treat, &amp;amp;c.-a&#xD;
kind of introduction, you know, as your envoy plenipotentiary&#xD;
-that he may receive me with full faith and honor."&#xD;
" Of course," replie Coma, with a sweet smile of thankful-&#xD;
ness; "and I will tell him how kind and good you have been,&#xD;
just as I told him you would be. Shall I write it now?&#xD;
"You need not be in such haste," said the captain, rather&#xD;
crustily, considering his determination to keep cool and in a&#xD;
good humor, "for I do not expect to start out on my embassy&#xD;
to-night."&#xD;
a Sacrd!" exclaimed the general, throwing down his paper,&#xD;
and speaking in so loud a tone as to make Coma start with&#xD;
terror-" sacred! it makes me sick to read how our brethren&#xD;
are carrying on in la belle France. It won't do, Jean; poor&#xD;
France is not yet prepared for a republic; a monarchy, or a&#xD;
military government, will alone restore peace and order. But&#xD;
what think you of their efforts ?"&#xD;
"Their attempts will all prove abortive, and their bloody&#xD;
efforts at making a republic, as they call it," sneered Mont-&#xD;
lack, '"'will soon result in a monarchy, and then farewell for-&#xD;
ever to all these mushroom leaders you are eternally reading&#xD;
about. Your upstart fungi of the Reign of Terror, and of&#xD;
anarchy and demagoguery, will soon be kicked out of power,&#xD;
neck and heels, and we'll never hear again of these shining&#xD;
lights of republicanism."&#xD;
".Bah !" retorted the general, who, notwithstanding his own -&#xD;
private views of family, &amp;amp;c., always argued in favor of freedom&#xD;
and equality, and the rights of man, "you are in a bad humor,&#xD;
Jean, and determined to sneer down merit because it has strug-&#xD;
gled up from the canaille."&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8248-00000031"/>&#xD;
58                  SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
'- I am heartily pleased," retorted Montlack, with a mocking&#xD;
smile, "that you have at length concluded to adopt the level-&#xD;
Iing notions of this republic, and, for once in your life, believe&#xD;
that all men are free and equal, and that merit alone makes&#xD;
the man."&#xD;
You are familiar with my views in relation to rank and&#xD;
family," replied the general, sternly, at the same time glancing&#xD;
somewhat uneasily at his daughter, for he never spoke of the&#xD;
equality of men in her presence without a condition or proviso&#xD;
"and you, no doubt, feel as much as I do the necessity of_&#xD;
eepng up the digmty of ancient names; but this should not&#xD;
make us opposed to a popular government, or decry merit,&#xD;
merely because it has sprung from an humble origin."&#xD;
"01 I1am becoming very democratic myself, of late," laughed&#xD;
the captain, with a sly glance at Coma, "and have no doubt&#xD;
my fair cousin will bear me out in my republican views, and&#xD;
growing carelessness of ancient names and titles."&#xD;
Coma, in her simplicity, imagined that Montlack was kindly&#xD;
combating the peculiar-prejudices of her father, in order to&#xD;
smooth the way for her lover; and, so believing, with a thank-&#xD;
ful smile and a resolute heart-though her father looked stern&#xD;
enough to deter many a braver soul--replied to his half-laugh-&#xD;
ing sally-&#xD;
"Iadmire a proud name and ancient family as much as any&#xD;
one can do; and think a long line of ancestry, made noble by&#xD;
worthy and honorable deeds, well deserving of our praise and&#xD;
estimation, and a species of guarantee that their descendants&#xD;
will never swerve from the upright course pursued by their&#xD;
fathers. Looking at it in this light, I regard family and name&#xD;
as estimable and admirable; but, for one, I do not consider a&#xD;
man made worthy alone by the bravery and honesty of his an-&#xD;
cestors, and think that he should be judged by his own works,&#xD;
and not by the deeds of those long since filling an honorable&#xD;
grave. But I will go a step still farther," continued Coma,&#xD;
gainig courage, " and say that I look upon a man of refine-&#xD;
muent, and education, and bravery-although he can count a&#xD;
&#xD;
59&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
name no farther back than his own-as well worthy of praise,&#xD;
and esteem, and love as the most ancient noble of my father's&#xD;
ancestral home.&#xD;
"Tat! .tt Coma !" exclaimed her father, with a shrug of&#xD;
the shoulders, "you know nothing about these matters. You&#xD;
were born in this land-where noble blood is not so highly&#xD;
esteemed as it should be-and have inherited, no, not inherited,&#xD;
but rather absorbed, the democratic notions of those by whom&#xD;
you have been surrounded. You say truly, that a man should&#xD;
be judged by his own works, and that a descendant of an an-&#xD;
cient family should not be esteemed merely because he has&#xD;
noble blood in his veins; but suppose, Coma, he has, in addi-&#xD;
tion to his ancient name and lineage, all the ennobling traits&#xD;
you mention, is he not more worthy of esteem and love than&#xD;
one who has merely the noble traits without the ancient&#xD;
name?"&#xD;
"Your argument is very plausible, dear father," replied&#xD;
Coma, with a smile; "but yo must permit me to differ with&#xD;
you. I consider one struggling from obscurity, and, in spite&#xD;
of the humbleness of his parentage, building to himself a name&#xD;
-a proud one, if you please-entirely- upon native worth&#xD;
and excellence, far more to be admired and esteemed than&#xD;
one who has a long list of noble ancestry to sustain, cheer, and&#xD;
force him on, in spite of his own natural wants, to deeds of&#xD;
chivalry and nobleness. The one is entitled -to all the credit&#xD;
himself; the other to none-for, raised and nurtured to consider&#xD;
bravery and noble actions a part of his patent of nobility, he&#xD;
could scarce be otherwise than noble and brave; and with him&#xD;
it is more a duty than a merit."&#xD;
"Why, Coma," laughed her father, " from the heat with&#xD;
which you defend your peculiar notions, I'm a little afraid&#xD;
that, in spite of all my endeavors to the contrary, you have at&#xD;
last lost your heart to some Adonis among our farmers or fish-&#xD;
ermen. Which is it ?" he added, in a slightly ironical tone.&#xD;
"Am I to have a plough and reaping-hook added to my leopard&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8248-00000032"/>&#xD;

&#xD;
SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
. yuchant, or shall it be a pole erectant, with a string pendant,&#xD;
and a fish to the end on't?"&#xD;
Coma laughed; but, in spite of her amusement at the plea-&#xD;
sant manner of her father, could not help blushing, and made&#xD;
no answer to his good-humored charge; Montlack, however,&#xD;
came to her rescue, exclaiming-.&#xD;
"I don't think, general, you will have added to your leopard&#xD;
couchant either a plough or fish pendant; but what say you to&#xD;
a-broken musket, a.tattered banner, and a brave cavalier lying&#xD;
upon a bloody field ?"&#xD;
" Ha! does the wind lie in that direction ?" said the old&#xD;
man, musing.&#xD;
With an eager and bright look of beaming thankfulness and&#xD;
intelligence, Coma met the glance of the cunning captain; and&#xD;
this look was not clouded, as the general, rising from his chair&#xD;
to retire, said-&#xD;
"The brave heart and bloody battlefield have been the outset&#xD;
of All nobility; and he that won his spurs in the fierce combat&#xD;
wvs ever deemed as noble as the noblest! I fear no stain upon&#xD;
my escutcheon, Coma," he added, tenderly, to his daughter,&#xD;
"if to my leopard couchant you add either the broken spear or&#xD;
tattered banner."&#xD;
The parlor of De Lacy was once more empty; but it was not&#xD;
cold or cheerless, for bright glowing coals .still crackled upon&#xD;
the hearth, and it was a fit place for revelling sprites and&#xD;
fairies to dance their airy numbers, cheered by the happy song&#xD;
of the cricket from beneath the huge old hearth-stone.&#xD;
The general went away contented; Coma hopeful and satis-&#xD;
fled; and the treacherous Montlack, although burning with&#xD;
internal fires, confident and exulting.&#xD;
Time alone will unravel the gathering woof.&#xD;
&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
&#xD;
EARLY on the ensuing morning, Montlack, armed with the&#xD;
loving missive of Coma, went forth in search of his rival; and&#xD;
he went with heart and head both fully prepared to wind his&#xD;
slimy coils around the lover, as he had done around his trusting&#xD;
cousin.&#xD;
At the same time, Bryan, with bounding heart, left the&#xD;
humble roof of his foster-father, and went forth to meet his&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
Shortly after, Sharp-Eye, accompanied by Titus and Bang,&#xD;
followed the footsteps of Bryan, but at such a distance as not&#xD;
to be discovered.&#xD;
"Titus," said Sharp-Eye to the black, as he pursued the&#xD;
fresh trail of the unconscious lover, "it strikes me Mister&#xD;
Bryan is gettin' himself into some trouble, and if we ain't on&#xD;
the look-out to lend him a helpin' hand, I rather guess he'll&#xD;
he wusted, and may-be lose his scalp."&#xD;
" Miss Coma ?" giggled the negro.&#xD;
"Worser than her ! for she ain't so bad, I guess; but, then&#xD;
thar's that frog-eatin' Frenchman !--I believe he's got nigger&#xD;
blood in his veins-and that ar' red-headed scoundrel I've&#xD;
caught crawlin' 'bout like a 'tarnal Ingen. I wouldn't be sur-&#xD;
prised," he added, with a mysterious shake of the head, "if&#xD;
old Betsy," looking lovingly at his rifle, "would mistake that&#xD;
ar' same feller for a redskin yet, and jist blaze away all the&#xD;
same as if I wer' squintin' along them ar' sights at a genuine&#xD;
Mingo. Would you, Bang ?"&#xD;
Bang responded with a loud. bark; but no sooner had he&#xD;
done so than the Scout, turning gravely upon him, and look-&#xD;
ing him intently in the face, said, sternly-&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
6-&#xD;

60&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8248-00000033"/>&#xD;
62   'SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
"See here, Mr. Bang; I don't want any of your loud talkin',&#xD;
now, jist remember; if we are in this darned civilized country,&#xD;
we are on a trail now, and I want you to answer my questions&#xD;
like a sensible dog, and all the same as if we wer' upon the&#xD;
war-path of a scalping Shawanee; do you understand, sir ?"&#xD;
Bang, looking very much cast down by the reproof of his&#xD;
master, replied with a low growl, as if fully aware of his cur-&#xD;
rish forwardness; and Simon, as if satisfied with the Christian&#xD;
manner of his companion's repentance, added, with an em-&#xD;
phatic gesture-&#xD;
"Then take your place; and, mind! don't let me hear a&#xD;
word from you until you are asked some civil question. That&#xD;
bark of your'n would have lost us our scalps, had we been upon&#xD;
the trail of a Shawanee or Wyandotte."&#xD;
Like a dog when he feels he has been doing some wrong,&#xD;
Bang drooped his tail, and silently took the lead, followed&#xD;
closely by the Scout; whilst old Titus, filled with superstitious&#xD;
terror at this seemingly intelligible conversation between the dog&#xD;
and his master, brought up the rear.&#xD;
About half way between the mansion of De Lacy and the&#xD;
farm of Duffe, and only a short distance from the haunted cot-&#xD;
tage occupied by Girty, the rivals met. A minute later, and&#xD;
Bang, cautiously stealing to the top of a little hillock, stopped&#xD;
suddenly, giving a peculiar growl; and the Scout, as if fully&#xD;
understanding the warning of his dog, after motioning Titus&#xD;
to be still, went warily forward.&#xD;
"Thar they are, sure enough !" he muttered, when once by&#xD;
the side of Bang; '"and jist as I 'spected; that dratted French-&#xD;
man shaking 'the hand of Mister Bryan.   Why, bless us,&#xD;
Titus!" he added, addressing the black, that worthy hav-&#xD;
ing crept to his feet, "he's no more than a savage, for hecan't&#xD;
talk nat'ral born English, like an honest man; end when he&#xD;
first came 'parley-vooin' about, during the wars, he' wasn't as&#xD;
high larn't in our lingo as Bang.  Ugh! jist look how he&#xD;
shakes Mister Bryan's hand! H~e 'minds me, with his grins&#xD;
and jimeracks, of a cussed redskin I once met with."&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.              63&#xD;
"How do you make out dat ?" asked the black, inquiringly,&#xD;
for he knew some story was at the end of the Scout's tongue;&#xD;
and, like some people we know of, couldn't let such an occa-&#xD;
sion slip.&#xD;
"Well," replied the borderer, who was just as ready to tell,&#xD;
as the negro was to hear a story, "it happened somewhat in&#xD;
this way: I wer' smellin' uip the trail of a prowlin' Shawanee,&#xD;
and had been beatin' about on it all day, when, the first thing I&#xD;
know'd-bang went a rifle, and whiz went a bullet most un-&#xD;
common close to my ear, for I heard it sing as it passed. -It&#xD;
war'n't no time before I up with old Betsy, and let blaze at&#xD;
the dodgin' villain in retain; and down he dropped all in a heap&#xD;
like a 'possum in persimmon time, and away I went to see&#xD;
how he got along with an ounce-ball in his carcass; and what&#xD;
do you think the pesky devil did?"&#xD;
-"Me don't know, Massa Simon! 'spect he sung out for&#xD;
quarterss" replied Titus, innocently.&#xD;
" No, he didn't, neither; that ain't the way we do business&#xD;
out in Kaintuck; he jist thought to throw dirt in my eyes,&#xD;
cuss him! and poked out his hand, like that jabbering French-&#xD;
man thar-darn me if I don't believe he's got nigger blood&#xD;
in him !-and said, 'How de do, broder?"'&#xD;
" Golly! him be broder after miss fire ?" said Titus, with a&#xD;
grin.&#xD;
"Jist so; but I wer'n't goin' to 'knowledge no sich a blamed&#xD;
redskin rascal; and so gin him a taste of my tomahawk, and&#xD;
lifted his scalp.  If he wer' a brother of mine," added the&#xD;
Scout, with a wink, " darn me if I ever seed him before !&#xD;
and we wer'n't raised by the same mamma, sartain! I took a&#xD;
lock of his hair to 'member him by, though; and here it .is,&#xD;
and a very nice one too!"&#xD;
Titus had often-.before seen, and, perhaps, admired, the&#xD;
bloody trophies of the Scout; b~t, after hearing the story of&#xD;
his companion, and his attention being thus drawn to a parti-&#xD;
cular lock, he again, for a moment, with staring eye, contem-&#xD;
plated it; then turned his rolling orbs upon the undisturbed&#xD;

&#xD;
countenance of its possessor, then upon old Betsy; and then,&#xD;
rather hurriedly (for he thought he was watched by that&#xD;
worthy), upon Bang; and not feeling entirely safe, or at ease,&#xD;
in such dangerous company, slowly edged himself away from&#xD;
such neighbors.&#xD;
Sharp-Eye did not notice this little by-play on the part of&#xD;
the black, for he had turned his head away, and was once&#xD;
more gazing eagerly down upon Bryan and Monflack.&#xD;
The two latter personages had met, and greeted each other,&#xD;
very much in the manner described by Simon; for Montlack,&#xD;
upon meeting Bryan, had guessed that he was the object of&#xD;
his search, and with true French grace and courtesy had made&#xD;
himself known, and, with the letter of Coma in his hand, had&#xD;
soon secured the confidence and good-will of the unsuspicious&#xD;
lover.&#xD;
For an hour or more, the rivals sat together in earnest con-&#xD;
versation. There could not have been two individuals' more&#xD;
unlike than Bryan and Montlack: the one open and excited,&#xD;
and, by his love, impassioned--the other cool and plausible,&#xD;
although, from the natural vivacity of his race, he appeared&#xD;
vehement and impulsive; the one all truth, honor, and confi-&#xD;
dence-the other all falsehood, faithlessness, and treachery.&#xD;
During this time, the captain had been busily reading the cha-&#xD;
racter of his- intended victim; and, finding the task an easy&#xD;
one, for there was neither coldness to remove, hypocrisy to un-&#xD;
ravel, nor worldly inning to combat, he at length, seizing an&#xD;
opportune moment, with a look and voice of well-assumed&#xD;
sorrow and mortification, exclaimed-.&#xD;
"You have learned, dear Bryan-for you must allow me&#xD;
thus to address you, now that you have the love of my cousin,&#xD;
and will soon, if nothing untoward happens, be still nearer&#xD;
and dearer to her--that I have long been the devoted admirer&#xD;
of Coma. My uncle desires our union; and I had cherished a&#xD;
hope that the heart of my cousin-was not entirely dead to my&#xD;
devotion ; but I was deceived, for it, was only cousinly affection&#xD;
she bore me; and since I have discovered my error, although it&#xD;

was a sad blow to my golden dreams, I have determined that she&#xD;
shall not know or see my suffering, and I shall use all my power&#xD;
with her father to secure her happiness, even though that hap-&#xD;
piness doom me to a lifetime of wretchedness. For this pur-&#xD;
pose alone am I here to-day, and nothing but my great love for&#xD;
her and secret determination to see her happy could ever have&#xD;
induced me to meet my successful rival, and make the morti-&#xD;
fying confession I have just made."&#xD;
"Generous and noble man !" exclaimed Bryan, "how can&#xD;
I ever repay such great magnanimity ?"&#xD;
" By giving me your love, and sometimes thinking, you and&#xD;
Coma, of her absent cousin," said Montlack, turning away his&#xD;
head to concealtpe smile that, in spite of every effort, would&#xD;
play around his mouth.&#xD;
"We can never forget your noble sacrifice," replied Bryan,&#xD;
seizing the hand of Montlack; "but why will you leave us ?"&#xD;
"I might regret the sacrifice I have made, were I to remain&#xD;
here, day by day, witnessing your happiness, and forever&#xD;
brooding over my own great loss. No, no! when I see all your&#xD;
hopes consummated, and behold the face of Coma beaming with&#xD;
joy, I must away at once to some distant land, and there pray&#xD;
for your continued felicity. But, alas !" he continued, cover-&#xD;
ing his face with his hands, as if ashamed to acknowledge his&#xD;
poverty, "why do I talk so? for I am without means, and&#xD;
even this poor boon, of dissipating my cares and sorrows in a&#xD;
distant country, and amid new scenes, is denied me."&#xD;
"Not while I have a cent to share with you !" exclaimed&#xD;
the duped lover, with generous emotion, his heart bounding&#xD;
with sympathy, and his whole soul filled with admiration at&#xD;
what he considered the nobleness of his rival. "Here!" he&#xD;
continued, extending his pocket-book; "Ihave not much; but&#xD;
what I have is yours; take it all; and would that I had it in&#xD;
my power to make it a hundredfold greater!-for, even then,&#xD;
it would not express my admiration and gratitude at your un-&#xD;
heard-of generosity and nobleness."&#xD;
"I cannot accept your noble and generous offer," said the&#xD;

-aptain, with assumed backwardness, at the same time gently&#xD;
pushing away the extended hand of Bryan. "I thank you-for&#xD;
your kindness, but must decline receiving so large a sum&#xD;
from a stranger."-&#xD;
"A stranger !" murmured Head, in a deep and feeling tone,&#xD;
for he was grieved at the refusal of his offer. "Did you not,&#xD;
but a moment since, call me dear Bryan ? and has not your&#xD;
kindness and the letter of Coma made us as old friends ? and&#xD;
will you still refuse my poor gift merely because I have not&#xD;
known you for years? Come, you must not treat me so! You,&#xD;
who have given so much to me, must not, and, by Heaven !&#xD;
shall not, thus turn away from my humble offering!"&#xD;
"I cannot,!" persisted Montlack, again refusing the ex-&#xD;
tended gift; "I must even await the pleasure of my good uncle;&#xD;
for he is generous and liberal, and, had I not been so extrava-&#xD;
gant, I would now have, from the allowance last made me, a&#xD;
sufficient sum to bear me back to France, where, amid the&#xD;
tumult of revolution and wild raging of war, I might have for-&#xD;
gotten, for a time at least, the heavy sorrow of my disappointed&#xD;
heart."&#xD;
"I swear to you !" exclaimed Bryan, greatly excited by the&#xD;
assumed tone and manner of the captain, and the continued&#xD;
refusal of his offer, " if you do not receive it, I will cast the&#xD;
yellow dross into the Yadkin; and there may it remain for.&#xD;
ever, for I will never touch it again."&#xD;
"Young men are ever thoughtless and rash," said the cap-&#xD;
tain, not wishing to risk the loss of the money by persisting&#xD;
too long in his feigned diffidence; "and rather than permit&#xD;
you to be guilty of so foolish an act, I will receive it-but, re-&#xD;
member, only as a loan."'&#xD;
" Thank you! thank you!" exclaimed Bryan, again attempt-&#xD;
ing to push the money upon his companion; but Montlack,&#xD;
still refusing to receive it, replied-&#xD;
"Not now, or in this manner; for when I receive it, Bryan,&#xD;
it must be done in a business, legal way, before a witness, and&#xD;
you must take my bond in return."&#xD;

"tHave it done as you see proper, so you receive it," said&#xD;
Bryan; «"I care not what forms you go through, for it is of&#xD;
little consequence; but let it be done at once, and settled, for&#xD;
I will not rest satisfied until you have the money in your pos-&#xD;
session."&#xD;
"I see very clc-rly, Mr. Bryan," replied, Montlack, with a&#xD;
laugh, for he was well pleased with the success of his scheme&#xD;
thus far, "that you know nothing of the use of money. I can&#xD;
but smile to think what a figure you would cut.in the hands of&#xD;
-some I know of.  Sacre ! what a partner you would make for&#xD;
some close-fisted Jew ! and how it would set on fire his swine-&#xD;
hating heart to hear you talk thus of giving away thousands,&#xD;
and without so much as a bond in return!"&#xD;
"Such a course might not answer with money-loving Jews,"&#xD;
laughed Bryan; "but with gentlemen, captain, I consider bonds&#xD;
unnecessary."&#xD;
" But I do -not," said Montlack, dryly; "for who knows how&#xD;
long I may call this head my own, once I am well mingled- in&#xD;
the tumults and conspiracies of Paris?-and, my head gone,&#xD;
where will be the tongue to acknowledge my indebtedness?&#xD;
No, no; my bond is not worth much just at present; but it is&#xD;
worth more than my word; and the thing must be done all&#xD;
straight and legally, or I will not take the loan. To do so, as&#xD;
you seem in haste-a most unusual thing with a lender of&#xD;
money," added Montlack, with a smile-" we will step down&#xD;
to the cottage below there, where, if I am not mistaken, we&#xD;
will find a witness, and in the person of the honest fisherman&#xD;
who gave me the first intelligence of your love for Coma."&#xD;
" The rascal that gave us such an alarm on yesterday?" said&#xD;
Head.&#xD;
" The same," responded Montlack, "and a very honest fel-&#xD;
low."&#xD;
"I forgive him the momentary fright he caused me," said&#xD;
Bryan, feelingly, "since his eavesdropping has been the cause&#xD;
of my introduction to one so noble and generous as I have found&#xD;
you.~"&#xD;

4None of your flattery, Bryan, or I will begin to think you.&#xD;
have some of the Frenchman about you. But come, let us&#xD;
finish this matter of the loan, and then you may away to see&#xD;
Coma, and I will go try my power upon this stiffnecked uncle&#xD;
of mine."&#xD;
Montlack and Bryan, arm in arm, as if the oldest and dear-&#xD;
est of friends, walked slowly away in the direction of Girty's&#xD;
desolate cabin, and Sharp-Eye, after following their retreating&#xD;
persons with his eye until they had passed out of sight, sprang&#xD;
to his feet, muttering, in a puzzled tone:-.&#xD;
"Well, blast my buttons if this don't rather beat me ! But&#xD;
up with you, Titus; the game is off; and now that we are in for&#xD;
it, jist let's see it out. It will be dratted.strange if we don't&#xD;
get at the bottom of this 'ere matter, somehow or other, before&#xD;
we are done with it. Won't it, Bang?",&#xD;
Bang, growling his usual assent, once more took the trail;&#xD;
and, followed by his puzzled master and the wondering black,&#xD;
slowly pursued the footsteps of the retreating rivals.&#xD;
That lonely cottage, with its dreary, moss-covered roof, its&#xD;
tumbling chimney, its glassless windows, its half-gone porch,;&#xD;
its broken-down fences, and its weedy, briery, yard, was a strik-&#xD;
ing picture of gloomy desolation, and decay, and death; and&#xD;
no wonder the simple rustics believed it the home of ghosts and&#xD;
spirits, and never entered within its haunted precincts. To me,&#xD;
no object is more sad and chilling to the heart than a deserted&#xD;
house, lonely and silent, with its neglected garden and yard, its&#xD;
rooms garlanded with cobwebs, and the dusty floor echoing back&#xD;
solemnly the footstep of the intruder. I knew such a house in&#xD;
my boyhood, haunted, of course, for it had not been inhabited&#xD;
for many years; and I can well remember how my hair used to&#xD;
stand on end, and my heart thump audibly, when, with my&#xD;
playfellows, made brave by numbers, we dared to enter within&#xD;
its silent and ghost-tenanted walls.&#xD;
But Montlack and Bryan had no such fancies upon approach-&#xD;
ing the retreat of Girty, for their thoughts were otherwise en-&#xD;

gaged; and without note or remark, they stooped beneath its&#xD;
timeworn lintel, and entered.&#xD;
"I know'd it!1" exclaimed the Scout. - "That big redheaded&#xD;
feller, with the scar, has something to do in this 'ere matter,&#xD;
and whar he makes his mark, Titus, you may jist look out for&#xD;
blood and xascality, or I'm no judge of human natur'. Down&#xD;
on your marrowbones, old fellow," said Simon, turning to the&#xD;
black, " and try your hand at skulking. Jist throw yourself&#xD;
behind that broken piece of fence; then make a dodge for yon&#xD;
tree; then another for that stump thar; and then a bold&#xD;
move will take you to the house. Once thar, mind, old fellow,&#xD;
and use your peepers, for I want to know what's going on in&#xD;
that dratted old graveyard."&#xD;
"0 massa!I" ejaculated the negro, in reply to these hurried&#xD;
commands and instructions of the Scout, "dis old boy can't do&#xD;
dat; him be 'fraid of the ghosts, for dat house be haunted dis&#xD;
long time."&#xD;
a4Haunted, you old white-liver!" exclaimed Sharp-Eye.&#xD;
"Just do as I tell you, or cuss me if I don't lift that woolly&#xD;
scalp of your'n, and then we'll have the ghost of a nigger to&#xD;
keep company with old Girty and his crew. Blame me, if I&#xD;
think they wer' far wrong, after all, in killing the old rascal for&#xD;
a Tory, for he must have been a precious old villain ever to have&#xD;
such a scoundrelly son as this renegade, murdering Simon of&#xD;
his. Come, be brisk, Titus," added the Scout, cheeringly, as&#xD;
he noticed the hesitation of the negro; "1who knows what good&#xD;
you may do Mister. Bryan by this little private observation?&#xD;
And the ghosts, you know, don't travel by daylight, for they've&#xD;
got eyes like owls, all them I've seen, and can't see 'cept at&#xD;
night. That's it! go ahead, my old brave, for I'll keep watch&#xD;
over this 'ere establishment, and if Mr. Redhead but shows his&#xD;
muzzle, like as if he intended any harm, then we'll jist blaze&#xD;
away, and leave him thar to keep company with the tother&#xD;
ghosties."&#xD;
"You say de ghosts don't trabel by daylight ?" inquired&#xD;
Titus, throwing off his coat.&#xD;

"It's agin natur' for them to be out 'cept at nights,"replied&#xD;
the 'Scout, with a wink of intelligence at Bang.&#xD;
"Den me be off; for I ain't 'fear'd of nothin' but ghosts and&#xD;
de devil," was the brave reply of the black, his love for his&#xD;
young master, with the assurances of Kenton on the score of&#xD;
spirits, at last overcoming his reluctance to intrude upon&#xD;
haunted ground.&#xD;
Following the directions of his more experienced companion,&#xD;
Titus was soon snugly ensconced in the rear of the old cottage,&#xD;
and staring in through a convenient crevice at its inmates.&#xD;
It was not long before Bryan came forth from the cabin,&#xD;
and with a light heart and foot moved off at a rapid pace. He&#xD;
was so intent upon getting away that he scarce glanced at the&#xD;
desolate building he was leaving, and it left no impression upon&#xD;
his mind. His thoughts were preoccupied, and with a more&#xD;
pleasant subject, for he was on his way to meet Coma. A few&#xD;
moments after, and the captain also came forth and, chuckling&#xD;
to himself as he crossed the threshold, moved out through the&#xD;
weed-covered yard, pursuing, at a slow, deliberate pace the&#xD;
same path taken by his deceived rival. Titus did not remain&#xD;
long behind,' but, after a rapid and intense scrutiny of the dark&#xD;
visage of the ruffian deft alone in the cabin, crept noiselessly&#xD;
away, and rejoined the impatient Scout..&#xD;
" By golly ! Massa Simon," he exclaimed, with a puzzled look,&#xD;
as soon as he got in speaking distance of Kenton, "dis is not&#xD;
de first time dis boy eber saw dat feller down dar in de cabin."&#xD;
"Very like," muttered Sharp-Eye. "I thought the same&#xD;
the first time I saw him. But who the devil is he, Titus?"'&#xD;
"Dar you be too hard for me, Massa Simon," replied the&#xD;
black, scratching his head, as if to stir up his memory, and&#xD;
bring back the features of the scarred and disguised Girty.&#xD;
" Well, blast him! let him pass," put in the Scout, impa-&#xD;
tient at the negro's delay. "We'll find him out soon enough.&#xD;
But tell me, Titus, what wer' going on down thar ?"&#xD;
" When dis child seed dem fust," replied Titus assuming&#xD;
an air of importance that would have been vastly amusing to&#xD;

I fust clapped my wisionaries on Massa Bryan, de captain, and&#xD;
dat tother feller-drat his red read," he added, parenthetically,&#xD;
"I knows him, but can't 'zactly call his name-de captain wer&#xD;
scribing on a piece of paper, and den he got up, and dat big&#xD;
feller just sot down and put his fist to de paper too, and den&#xD;
Massa Bryan took it up and put it in his pocket, sort of .care-&#xD;

"What then?" asked Sharp-Eye.&#xD;
"De captain and Redhead-I golly! I knows him-jist give&#xD;
a laugh when Massa Bryan wer' gone, not like when you or&#xD;
Massa Dufie laugh, but a kind of laugh dat covered a feller all&#xD;

and none of dem old continentals we wer' used to hab in de&#xD;

" Never mind; what did they do then ?" said Simon, impa-&#xD;
tiently, for he was annoyed by the negro's garrulity, and wished&#xD;
to. know all at once.&#xD;
" When dey had counted it over and over, to see wedder&#xD;
him be all right, I s'pose, de captain jist pushed it all to Red-&#xD;
head, sayin', 'That's your'n.'"&#xD;
"Did he call no name ?" asked the Scout, with a puz7zlpd&#xD;

" De captain called Redhead Mr. Brant--if dis indiwidual&#xD;

Sharp-Eye gave a muttered "Humphs !" to this satanic con-&#xD;
clusion of the negro's story, but made no farther inquiry.&#xD;
Shouldering his rifle, he looked with a longin eye towards&#xD;
cabin,as ifundetermined, but half inclined to pay its occupant&#xD;

As if totally at-a loss what to do or think, the Scout stood&#xD;
a moment longer, looking vacantly around; then, as if struck&#xD;
with some new thought, for his countenance brightened up,&#xD;
he hurried-away at .a rapid pace, followed by his companions;&#xD;
nor did he halt or speak a word until he had reached the pre-&#xD;
imises .of Duffe, when, beckoning that worthy with his hand,&#xD;
the two retired tto a secret place; and, from the length of their&#xD;
conversation, must have held a long council of war.&#xD;
The result of their grave deliberation was not made known&#xD;
either to Bang, Titus, or the world; and so we will have to&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER         VII-&#xD;
As we have made up our mind, in the language of the law,&#xD;
to stick closely to the record, and never wander in pais, we&#xD;
will not now stop to consume your valuable time (0 Jupiter!)&#xD;
with a description of the general when he learned from Mont&#xD;
lack the love of Coma, and her engagement; or of the blush-&#xD;
ing daughter when called into the presence of her angry father,&#xD;
to hear his matter-of-fact, and, we have no doubt, very un-&#xD;
interesting discourse concerning filial duties, obedience, and&#xD;
many other very proper subjects of discussion on any other&#xD;
occasion than when love is concerned. To tell the truth,'and&#xD;
this is a duty enjoined upon us all--although, I fear, one most&#xD;
woefully neglected, if we are to believe one-half we read of in&#xD;
novels-this thing called Love is a terrible leveller, as much so&#xD;
as sans ulottism in Paris, and cares about as little for locks, or&#xD;
bars, or paternal commands; and, as we do not wish to have&#xD;
anything to do with a matter or thing governed and ruled by&#xD;
no fixed law, we will now, like unto some politicians we wot&#xD;
of, just give it the go-by, and dive, with furious zeal, into&#xD;
something else.&#xD;
It is enough for us to say, so that you .may get fully into&#xD;
the thread of our story, that the general, persuaded by Mont-&#xD;
lack (for the captain had his scheme to play out, wishing as&#xD;
yet to stand fair in the eyes of his cousin), and softened a lit-&#xD;
tle by fhe tears and entreaties of his daughter, had made up&#xD;
his mind, like many good fathers both before and since his&#xD;
time (now that he couldn't help himself), to submit with as&#xD;
rauch grace as possible, and, that he might not yield too readily,&#xD;
had agreed to meet his intended son-in-law; and if the latter-&#xD;
he was very positive on this point-could show proper creden-&#xD;

&#xD;
tials of his standing in society, and of the respectable name of&#xD;
his family, not to object to him on account of his poverty.&#xD;
This determination of the general fully satisfied Coma, and&#xD;
she went on her way rejoicing; nor did it dissatisfy Montlack,&#xD;
for he well knew that, in the course of the intended examina-&#xD;
tion, the relationship of Bryan to Colonel Head, the suspected&#xD;
traitor and spy, would very naturally turn up; and that alone,&#xD;
the cunning captain was confident, would be a sufficient reason&#xD;
in itself to destroy all the hopes of the lover, and raise an un-&#xD;
governable storm of opposition in the bosom of his very proud&#xD;
and punctilious relation.&#xD;
It was early evening, and twilight was still lingering in the&#xD;
west, as if struggling for supremacy, or, like some young&#xD;
widow, loath to put on the sable robes of night, when Bryan,&#xD;
with fluttering heart, sat in the grand parlor of De Lacy, under-&#xD;
going that most terrible of all ordeals to a young lover, his&#xD;
first or last meeting with an intended father-in-law.&#xD;
So far, the general had been all urbanity and politeness;&#xD;
and, if ever a man can feel entirely easy upon such occasions,&#xD;
Bryan had begun to enjoy some such feeling, when the for-&#xD;
mer, with some-abruptness, remarked-..&#xD;
"You are about, Mr. Head, to become a very near relation&#xD;
of mine, and as you ,are almost an entire stranger to me, I&#xD;
would be gratified to learn something of your father and of&#xD;
his station in society; for, you must know, my dear sir, that&#xD;
although I put very little value upon wealth, I am somewhat&#xD;
particular concerning family,' especially in the connection we&#xD;
are about forming, and place a very high estimate upon a pure&#xD;
and honorable genealogy."&#xD;
Bryan was unconscious that any stain had ever rested upon&#xD;
the escutcheon of his father, and to this direct inquiry of the&#xD;
general, which he had been expecting, answered quickly, and&#xD;
with a proud beating heart----&#xD;
"I am very poor, as you are aware, and can only say for&#xD;
myself thatI am an orphan, with a fair education, and with&#xD;
the emotions of a son descended from a gentleman, and claim-&#xD;

place upon a fair name and family, for, I feel satisfied that I&#xD;
will not incur either your contempt or reproach when I tell .&#xD;
u I am the only child of Colonel Robert Head, of the Con-&#xD;
tinental Army."&#xD;
tW hat! do you mean the Colonel Head that fell at Gul-&#xD;
ford Court-OUSe ?" exclaimed De Lacy, his face, first turning&#xD;
h     ale and then livid with rage.&#xD;
as  The same," replied Bryan, quietly; for he did not see, or&#xD;
if he did, was unaware of any reason for, the great change that&#xD;
'had come* so suddenly over the face of his questioner.&#xD;
Without another word to Bryan, the general sprang quickly&#xD;
to a bell, and ringing it furiously, bade the servant, answering&#xD;
his summons, to send, to him at once the captain and Miss&#xD;
Coma. During~ this time, Bryan sat filled with amazement,&#xD;
totally at a loss to understand the hurried movements and great&#xD;
excitement now evident upon the features of De Lacy.  ad&#xD;
he was not allowed to remain long in doubt, for no sooner&#xD;
lied blushingly into the room, and the captain, with a&#xD;
quick glance at his relation, presented his smiling face, than&#xD;
e   neural turned the astonishment of the lover quickly and&#xD;
at once to anger, by exclaiming, in a furious, contemptuous.&#xD;
voice, at the same time pointing deridingly with his finger-&#xD;
"And that is the noble son-in-law you doting fools would&#xD;
ive me I Listen, Coma-and you, too, captain---for, if you&#xD;
did not know it before, I will inform you now that that low&#xD;
fellow-he who would join his ignoble name with that of De&#xD;
Lacy-is the son of a base spy and traitor; the wretched off-&#xD;
rin of a disgraced and perjured man!f"&#xD;
Springing to his feet-while a flash of indignant fury gleamed&#xD;
from his sparkling eye-Bryan, with a flush of anger, man-&#xD;
tling his handsome face, haughtily confronted the stern-visaged&#xD;
old general, replying to his infamous charge i a proud, e-&#xD;

"Were you not the father of that fair girl, and were not your&#xD;
head'bleached with the frosting tread of Time, here, and now,&#xD;
would I prove upon your person the foul falsehood of your in-&#xD;
famous and groundless slander against the honored name of&#xD;
my dead father."&#xD;
"Oh, Bryan," murmured Coma, throwing herself between&#xD;
her lover and her parent, "remember that you are speaking&#xD;
to my father !"&#xD;
"And in defence of one," said the lover, sternly.&#xD;
"My father is proud and stern,".continued Coma; "but he&#xD;
is just. He may be mistaken, Bryan, but he would not will-&#xD;
ingly or groundlessly defame the character of the living, much&#xD;
less the dead."&#xD;
"You say truly, Coma," replied the old man, looking kindly,&#xD;
and with some degree of sorrow, into the face of his weeping&#xD;
daughter; "I would be the last man living to defame the cha-&#xD;
racter of any one, much less that of a dead companion in arms.&#xD;
But, young man," he added, turning once more to where Bryan&#xD;
stood, as yet thunderstruck by this unexpected blow, "what I&#xD;
have said is true; and if you-and I hope it is so-are ignorant&#xD;
of the disgrace of your father, then you are ignorant of a fact&#xD;
well known to thousands."&#xD;
"You may truly believe what you now say, general," replied&#xD;
Bryan, firmly; "but you must be laboring under some grievous&#xD;
mistake. My father could not have been the degraded charac-&#xD;
ter you would have me believe. The son could not have re-&#xD;
mained so long ignorant of so terrible a charge against the fair&#xD;
name of his parent. The world is not so charitable as to allow&#xD;
him to live on in forgetfulness."&#xD;
"Captain Montlack belonged to the army, and knows what&#xD;
I have just said is true," answered the general, appealing to&#xD;
that worthy..&#xD;
Montlack, who had only been waiting a fit opportunity to&#xD;
turn against his rival, replied to this appeal of the general, with&#xD;
a look of hypocritical sorrow: "Alas ! if this young man be&#xD;

OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.             77&#xD;
the son of Colonel Robert Head, then the charge made by you&#xD;
against his father--I am grieved to say-is but too true.&#xD;
"Now, by the blood of my gallant parent, shed in the de-&#xD;
fence of his country," exclaimed Bryan, with angry quickness,&#xD;
striding towards the shrinking captain, "I, his son, here and&#xD;
now, take it upon myself to declare you, Captain Montlack, an&#xD;
infamous and wilful slanderer. Your uncle, here, may, within&#xD;
these proud walls he calls his own, attempt to cast odium&#xD;
upon my character, by attacking and defaming the fair name of&#xD;
my departed parent; and his age, and relationship to yon weep-&#xD;
ing girl, will protect him. But you, Captain Montlack, have&#xD;
no such protection; and I will make you, base slanderer that&#xD;
you are, acknowledge what you have just spoken a groundless&#xD;
falsehood."&#xD;
"You forget yourself, young sir!" exclaimed the general,&#xD;
angrily, as he stepped between the enraged son and retreating&#xD;
captain. "This is no place for strife; and, if you were the&#xD;
gentleman you claim to be, you would never thus have per-&#xD;
initted your passions to make you forget the courtesy you owe&#xD;
to the presence of a lady."&#xD;
Bryan stood abashed at this cutting reproof of the general;&#xD;
and, turning, with a look of poignant grief, to the weeping&#xD;
Coma, as if to beseech her forgiveness and mercy, muttered-&#xD;
"You say right, sir. This is no place for such scenes. But&#xD;
I trust that a son's deep feeling for the character of his defamed&#xD;
father will, in some manner, atone for and lessen my offence.&#xD;
"Oh! yes, father," said Coma, eagerly. " I know that you&#xD;
will forgive him what he has said, for this, your own proud&#xD;
soul will tell you, has been a most terrible and trying moment&#xD;
to him, and may well justify his passion."&#xD;
"For your sake, Coma, I forgive him," replied the old man,&#xD;
"and will take no umbrage at any language he may use in his&#xD;
mad anger."&#xD;
Bryan bowed haughtily, and Coma whispered her thanks.&#xD;

throw off his hypocritical assumption of esteem and affection&#xD;
for his rival, and insure his disgrace and dismissal forever-.&#xD;
exclaimed.--.&#xD;
"By heavens! this young son of a traitor carries himself&#xD;
loftily! He presumes upon: the presence of a lady, and that&#xD;
presence has protected him, or he would have long since been&#xD;
driven, like a base hound, from the house polluted by his per-&#xD;
son, and disgraced by his insulting and presumptuous demeanor.&#xD;
I acknowledge my error, and cry your mercy, general, for being&#xD;
so deceived by a cunning mercenary fellow like this. But you&#xD;
must pardon me, for it was my love for Coma alone that blinded&#xD;
me to his true character, and induced me to plead with you in&#xD;
his behalf. But, now that he has exhibited himself in his true&#xD;
colors, I would recommend that the beggarly knave-he that&#xD;
would so cunningly creep into an honorable house, and join his&#xD;
traitorous name to the proud escutcheon of the De Lacys-be&#xD;
driven forth with ignominy and scorn; and,.if ever he has the&#xD;
.hardihood to show himself here again, that he be treated like&#xD;
a common knave and beggar, that he is, and dragged through&#xD;
the horsepond."&#xD;
During this insulting tirade, Bryan stood panting with sup-&#xD;
pressed rage, his white teeth closing so tightly upon his com-&#xD;
pressed lips as to start from the livid flesh drops of blood.&#xD;
Coma, beholding his terrible agony, would fain have driven it&#xD;
away by sympathizing words; but the stern dark eye of her&#xD;
father forbade all interference on her part, and she sat in silence,&#xD;
looking mournfully upon the agitated features of her .lover.&#xD;
With a mighty effort to restrain his anger and be calm, Bryan,&#xD;
after glaring a moment in silence upon the person of the cap-&#xD;
tain, at length hissed between his clinched teeth-&#xD;
"You are a base, plotting scoundrel, Captain Montlack, and&#xD;
only brave in words, when you know that the presence of your&#xD;
cousin protects you from personal chastisement. You have&#xD;
deceived me well, captain, and have laid your toils quite skil-&#xD;
fully. But, remember, the hour of reckoning will yet come,&#xD;
and heavy, heavy will be my vengeance."&#xD;

"So," sneered Montlack, "you would add assassination to&#xD;
your already sufficiently disgraced name, would you ?"&#xD;
"Begone, sir !" said the general, once more interposing, and&#xD;
angrily addressing Bryan. "After what has just occurred,&#xD;
you must feel that your company is no longer acceptable; and&#xD;
I will add that it is my desire that you never again cross my&#xD;
threshold."&#xD;
"«As you will, sir," replied Bryan, haughtily.&#xD;
"Ay, begone, my doughty beggar !" added Montlack,&#xD;
mockingly; "and, if you need a few dollars to aid you in&#xD;
leaving the country, don't be too proud to call on me, for I will&#xD;
give them willingly, if for nothing else than the manner in,&#xD;
which you have played your part this evening."&#xD;
"You are cruel and ungenerous, Jean," murmured Coma.&#xD;
"Say no more, Montlack, and let the fellow go. He has&#xD;
been punished sufficiently," remarked the general.&#xD;
But the treacherous captain had a part to play, dark and&#xD;
deceitful-and for a particular purpose-and was but now&#xD;
throwing one of his strongest webs to entangle and destroy for-&#xD;
ever the struggling and almost hopeless lover.. He knew that,&#xD;
so far as the general was concerned, all chance of his consent&#xD;
to the union of Bryan and Coma was now forever gone; but&#xD;
he was not satisfied that Coma had given up her love, or lost&#xD;
confidence in her lover. On the contrary, he judged from her&#xD;
emotion--and judged very correctly-that, notwithstanding the&#xD;
disgrace of her lover, he still held a very prominent place in&#xD;
her heart; and it was his intention now to lower him, if possi-&#xD;
ble, in her estimation, and to do. so by a grave and infamous&#xD;
charge, which he designed making, if he could only induce&#xD;
Bryan to mention the money transaction that had taken place&#xD;
between them on the day previous. With this secret design,&#xD;
to insure success, he had, in the manner we have already de-&#xD;
scribed, taunted Bryan with beggary, and mockingly offered to&#xD;
loan him money; and the scheme of the plotting captain was&#xD;
crowned with complete success, for, to his taunts and sneers,&#xD;

&#xD;
his charge of poverty, and deriding offer of a loan Head stung&#xD;
to the quick, and goaded to desperation, sternly replied----..&#xD;
"I am a beggar, it is true, so far as wealth is concerned ;&#xD;
but who, Captain Montlack, under the garb of friendship, made&#xD;
me a beggar, and stripped me of my last little means? To&#xD;
leave this country, as you say, I will need money ; and that&#xD;
money I will demand of you-not as you would fain make&#xD;
those present believe---as a recipient of your charity, or as a&#xD;
gift from your dastardly hand; but as a right, and as a debt&#xD;
you honestly owe me !"&#xD;
I am ignorant of my indebtedness to you," sneered the&#xD;
captain, "other than a dragging through the horsepond for&#xD;
your present impudence; but I will give a few pennies at any&#xD;
time to clear the country of a traitor's son."&#xD;
"What !" exclaimed Bryan, gazing with blank astonishment&#xD;
at the cool and mocking face of Montlack, "are you so for-&#xD;
getful of past events ? or have you become so abandoned as to&#xD;
deny your indebtedness, and .thus add the crime of deliberate&#xD;
falsehood to those of hypocrisy and-deceit ?"&#xD;
"I most certainly deny any indebtedness to you other than&#xD;
- that I have just- mentioned," boldly replied Montlack.&#xD;
"Thanks!1 thanks for this boldfaced depravity !" exclaimed&#xD;
Bryan, with flashing eye, as he drew from his pocket the bond&#xD;
of the captain, "for I will now convict yod in the eyes .of your&#xD;
uncle and cousin of the blackest and most degrading of false-&#xD;
hoods. Is not that piece of paper," he added scornfully, hold-&#xD;
ng towards Montlack the bond he had executed, "your obliga-&#xD;
tion, acknowledging indebtedness to me in the sum of one&#xD;
thousand dollars ?"&#xD;
Coolly receiving the paper, the captain, with an unruffled&#xD;
countenance, gave it a close scrutiny; then, turning boldly to&#xD;
Bryan, he replied--&#xD;
"You have presumed a little too much upon my patience in&#xD;
this matter,,sir. This paper is, as you say, an obligation in&#xD;
my name for a thousand dollars; but I now pronounce it a&#xD;
base forgery--evident upon the very face of it--for it is not in&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.              81&#xD;
my handwriting; and the witness you have to it is a rene-&#xD;
gade and murderer; and, I have no doubt, one of your accom-&#xD;
plices in this cunning attempt to extort money."&#xD;
Overcome by his conflicting emotions, and by the dark vil-&#xD;
lany of the man in whom he had so confidently trusted, Bryan&#xD;
stood transfixed; and for the moment was unable to make any&#xD;
reply. Taking advantage of his silence, the captain handed&#xD;
the bond that he still retained in his possession to the general,&#xD;
remarking, "4Look for yourself; and you, too, Coma, if you&#xD;
are not already satisfied of the unworthiness of this man, look&#xD;
at that same paper he has had the hardihood to present as my&#xD;
bond; and you will be convinced in a moment of his utter&#xD;
depravity."&#xD;
" It is a base forgery, as you say," replied the general, as&#xD;
soon as he had glanced his eye over the paper; "and not one&#xD;
word written in your usual hand."&#xD;
" Alas!I' murmured Coma, as she looked anxiously and&#xD;
doubtingly upon the face of her lover, "it is too true. Oh!&#xD;
who would have believed that that glorious person and that&#xD;
broad, noble brow covered a heart so black and so utterly&#xD;
deceitful?"&#xD;
Bryan could have braved the eye, and returned scorn for&#xD;
scorn with the general and. captain, for he knew that he was&#xD;
innocent; and although astonished and thunderstruck at the&#xD;
grievous charge thus made against him, would have treated it&#xD;
with proud contempt; but when he heard the low desponding&#xD;
voice of Coma, and felt that he had lost her supporting sympa-&#xD;
thy and love, it was more than his struggling heart could bear,&#xD;
and, covering his face with his hands, the strong man's whole&#xD;
frame trembled with terrible and uncontrollable agitation--&#xD;
and he wept,&#xD;
" It is well, young man," said iDe Lacy, noticing his emo-&#xD;
tion, which he falsely ascribed to shame and guilt, "that you&#xD;
have at least a sufficient amount of honorable feeling left i&#xD;
your bosom to feel some remorse~for what you have done. But&#xD;
go now, and let me see you no more; else my duty as a magis-&#xD;

place you under the unforgiving and unpitying power of the&#xD;
law."&#xD;
"Ay ! go now and hunt up this renegade leader of savages,&#xD;
this murderer of women and children, this excellent witness&#xD;
and beautiful- accomplice of yours, the immaculate Simon&#xD;
Girty, and tell him for me," said Montlack, with a fiendish,&#xD;
smile of triumph, " that such tricks as this may answer with&#xD;
children, but not with men of the world, and that he had bet-&#xD;
ter back to the camp-fires of his redskin friends, if he would&#xD;
escape the'country with a whole skin.";&#xD;
" To you, Coma, I will now speak !" exclaimed Bryan, with&#xD;
sorrowful earnestness; "for it is worse than useless for me to&#xD;
bandy further words with such heartless judges as these. I&#xD;
now swear to you, by the memory of my father and mother, and&#xD;
by the memory of those blissful hours we have spent together,&#xD;
that I am guiltless of the dark charges made against me by this&#xD;
treacherous man; and that I will prove my father's name inno-&#xD;
cent of the heartless slander with which it stands defamed.&#xD;
And to you, Coma, I will also say, believe nothing that that&#xD;
cringing coward and soulless hypocrite, your cousin Jean, may&#xD;
tell you; for I pledge my honor--"&#xD;
"A poor pledge !" laughed Montlack, interrupting him.&#xD;
"Ay! I pledge you my sacred honor," continued Bryan,&#xD;
with a look of scorn at his rival, "that I will yet convince you&#xD;
of his utter depravity and meanness, and yet show him forth&#xD;
in his true character-the wolf stripped of his sheep's cloth-&#xD;
ing !".&#xD;
" Do !" exclaimed Montlack, mockingly. "Go, and hunt&#xD;
up this Simon Girty; for he was an accomplice of your father's&#xD;
treachery, and will not only prove his innocence, but, as he&#xD;
stands in the same relation to yourself, may do you the like&#xD;
favor. -I do not consider my character in much danger when&#xD;
the renegade Girty and the son of a spy and traitor are my&#xD;

reach of justice."&#xD;
"Farewell, Coma !" whispered the lover, springing to the&#xD;
side of the weeping girl before her astonished father could&#xD;
interfere to prevent him ; "believe me innocent until I see you&#xD;
again, and then shall all, now seemingly so dark, be as clear as&#xD;
your own spotless conscience."&#xD;
"God grant it may be so !" sighed Coma, "for I know not&#xD;
what to think."&#xD;
The general hastened to the side of his daughter, and Bryan,&#xD;
drawing back at .his approach, looked the old man so calmly&#xD;
and proudly in the face, and so honest and open was his manly&#xD;
countenance, and so steady the gleam of his flashing black eye,&#xD;
that even the haughty De Lacy quailed beneath' his glance,&#xD;
and, instead of the reproaches and insults he had intended to&#xD;
heap upon the head of the unfortunate lover, instinctively&#xD;
bowed, without uttering a word. To this silent and unintended&#xD;
mark of respect, Bryan returned a grave nod, and, with a&#xD;
marked and threatening gesture of the hand at his exulting&#xD;
rival, turned upon his heel and was gone.&#xD;
So far, duplicity had carried the day, and hypocrisy and&#xD;
falsehood were victorious over honesty and truth.&#xD;
"Honesty is the best policy," there is no doubt; yet, in this&#xD;
world of ours, rascality is so often successful as to be a great&#xD;
encouragement to knavery..&#xD;
Hypocrisy is odious to every one. Yet who, in all this wide&#xD;

CHAPTER        VIII.&#xD;
DUFFE, Simon Kenton, and Titus--a rather singular trium-&#xD;
virate in a love affair-sat gloomily by the fireside of the for-&#xD;
mer, anxiously awaiting the return of Bryan. They knew&#xD;
where he had gone, and had been now for some time moment-&#xD;
arily expecting his appearance. It was getting late, and more&#xD;
than once the foster-father had peered out wistfully in the&#xD;
gathering gloom of night to catch the approaching tread of his&#xD;
returning son. The wind sighed sadly through the moaning&#xD;
boughs of the swaying forest, filling the heart with desolate&#xD;
sadness. All nature seemed preparing for a storm; for now&#xD;
and then a gust of wind came howling along, accompanied by&#xD;
frequent flashes of lightning, followed by low rumbling thun-&#xD;
der; and Duffe, after one of his anxious visits to the door,&#xD;
returning with a troubled brow to his seat by the fireside,&#xD;
muttered-half in soliloquy, and half for the ears of his com-&#xD;
panions-&#xD;
"I don't like the appearance of the night. The signs all&#xD;
declare a coming storm; and presently we will have it, sweep-&#xD;
ing down through the forest like a troop of cavalry to -the&#xD;
charge. What can detain the boy ?" he added, anxiously,&#xD;
after a moment's pause, and, once more rising from his seat,&#xD;
strided to the door.&#xD;
"Don't be oneasy, Sargeant," said Simon, following him,&#xD;
"for it tain't no use, and the boy will turn up presently. You&#xD;
know how a youpg chap feels when he gets 'long side of his&#xD;
sweetheart. Bless me ! if he don't jist forgit whether it ar'&#xD;

my gal. Cuss him ! I gin him a good lickin', anyhow, and&#xD;
that wer' some satisfaction. But, blame me, Sargeant, if I&#xD;
weren't proper glad when I hearn he wasn't dead after all. You&#xD;
don't know how this 'ere thing troubled me, for I left him for&#xD;
dead; and them   ar' lawyer chaps--blast 'em!!-called it&#xD;
murder, and I had to leave the country. Although I wer' a&#xD;
killing' them darned Ingens every day, and didn't care a cuss&#xD;
about it, this 'ere lubberly scamp's big round face--as I saw it&#xD;
when I thought him dead from the thrashin' I had gin him--&#xD;
wer' always peeping at me from behind the trees, when I wer'&#xD;
lookin' out for Ingens, and sittin' by me at the camp-fires, tho'&#xD;
nobody ever wanted his comany or axed him. Whoop! how&#xD;
I danced when I hearn he war'n't dead, but alive and kickin',&#xD;
and had lots of little papooses; and I sot out at once, and come&#xD;
all the way back to the old State, jist to shake his hand, and&#xD;
thank him for not dyin'. I tell you what, Sargeant," con-&#xD;
tinued the hunter, addressing the inattentive ears of his com-&#xD;
panion, "it ar' one thing to kill an Ingen, and another to kill&#xD;
a white man. It ar' all nat'ral and right enough to scalp a,&#xD;
Mingo or Shawanee, but, blast me ! if you'll ever catch Simon&#xD;
Kenton killin' another white man, 'less it be that ar' murderin'&#xD;

"list !" exclaimed Duffe, his face brightening. "I hearua&#xD;

"Yes," replied the borderer, putting his hand to his ear,&#xD;
and catching the step with all the quickness 'acquired by a&#xD;
frontier life; "and coming' on with as measured a tread as -an&#xD;
Ingen chief goin' to the council-fire of' his nation."&#xD;
"Let's set down," said Duffe, returning to his seat, "for&#xD;
Mister Bryan might not like so much looking after."&#xD;
"That's a fact, as  true as preachin'," muttered Kenton,. re-&#xD;
suming his place by the fire, "for these 'ere young fellers,&#xD;

their seats, and put on an air of indifference, before Bryan,&#xD;
pale and haggard, staggered into the room, and, falling heavily&#xD;
into the first vacant seat within his reach, covered his face with&#xD;
his hands, his entire frame shaking with the intensity of his&#xD;
agitation.&#xD;
Duffe, who, notwithstanding his awkward and stiff appear-&#xD;
ance, was, both by heart and education, a gentleman, suspect-&#xD;
ing at once that the strong emotion exhibited by his foster-child&#xD;
was produced by some disappointment in his love-affair, and,&#xD;
may-be, a rejection of his suit, sprang quickly to his side, say-&#xD;
ing, in a low undertone-&#xD;
"Never mind, my boy; the cloud will soon pass away, and&#xD;
all will be sunshine again."&#xD;
"Hello, Mister Bryan !" shouted Sharp-Eye, in a more bois-&#xD;
terous voice-for he had his own notions about such matters,&#xD;
but spoke now with as much anxiety as his more refined com-&#xD;
panion--wishing to arouse and console the lover, and at the&#xD;
same time conceal his own emotion, "1you hain't seen any&#xD;
ghosts lately, have you? Cuss it, boy ! don't be a shakin' in&#xD;
that ar' way; it makes me feel bad-"-dev'lish bad, I can tell&#xD;
you-for it 'minds me of them 'tarnal agers I used to have.&#xD;
Here, jist take a swig of this'ere whiskey, and all will be right&#xD;
in five minutes, by the Sargeant's turnip over the mantle, or I&#xD;
never killed an Ingen."&#xD;
Bryan, aroused by the loud voice of the Scout, removed his&#xD;
hands from his face, and fastened his burning orbs, for a mo-&#xD;
ment upon the countenance of the rough but sympathizing&#xD;
borderer. Then, motioning away the proffered bottle with his&#xD;
hand, shook his head despondingly, and once more resumed&#xD;
his dejected position.&#xD;
"Gorror-mighty !" exclaimed Titus, who had been looking&#xD;
on in blank amazement, " I 'spect Massa Bryan am clean gone&#xD;
crazy, or he been seen old Girty's ghost."&#xD;
"What of Girty? and where is he ?" inquired Bryan, raising&#xD;
his head quickly, and speaking with eager anxiety.&#xD;
"Cuss me, if I know !'' responded Kenton,. with a doubting&#xD;

suspicions, "'less he be prowlin' 'round the settlements with&#xD;

"Come, Bryan, arouse yourself and tell us the cause of your&#xD;
strange agitation," exclaimed the Sergeant, at the same time&#xD;
laying his hand upon the arm of his foster-child.&#xD;
Awakened by the touch of iDuffe, Bryan struck his hand&#xD;
sharply upon his brow, seemingly to concentrate his wandering&#xD;
thoughts; then, looking around sadly at the anxious counte-&#xD;
nances of his friends, murmured--&#xD;
"Your hand, Duffe ; and yours, Simon; and yours, 'too,&#xD;
Titus; for I need now the sympathy of you all-even the&#xD;
humblest."&#xD;
" And you have it," replied Duffe, in a trembling voice, for&#xD;
he was deeply moved by the sad tone of his foster-child, and&#xD;
could scarce restrain his tears.&#xD;
"And-here's my paw," added Sharp-Eye, with eager zeal;&#xD;
"and may I be roasted to a cinder, Mister Bryan, by the&#xD;

" And woe be to those that would attempt to-deprive you of&#xD;
either!" exclaimed the sturdy Sergeant.'&#xD;
Ay!.a woe and-a cuss on them all !" added Kenton, draw-&#xD;

ness flashed from his keen blue eye.&#xD;
" And tho' I be black, Massa Bryan," muttered the honest&#xD;
negro, "my heart' be white, and in de right place. Say de&#xD;

" It will relieve your heart-and, although we are but humble&#xD;
in rank or fortune, you know, you will have our sympathy-&#xD;
and our advice may be of some advantage."&#xD;
" Before I make known to you my own wretched situation,"&#xD;
said Bryan, firmly, and looking intently into the open and ex-&#xD;
cited countenance of the Sergeant, "I would have you, Duffe,&#xD;
tell me honestly and candidly, and without hesitation, whether&#xD;
or not my father was a tractor to his country, and a spy?"&#xD;
Had a bombshell bursted at the feet of the listening Ser-&#xD;
geant, he would not have bpen more utterly amazed than he was&#xD;
at this unexpected question of Bryan. For a moment, he stood&#xD;
in speechless astonishment, when Bryan, interpreting it as&#xD;
a desire to evade an answer, and as proof positive of the dread-&#xD;
ful charge 'made by De Lacy, exclaimed with bitter agony-&#xD;
"Oh, my God ! is this, my last hope, gone? and is it true&#xD;
that I am but the dishonored son of a miserable and disgraced&#xD;
spy?"&#xD;
"And he that says so is a base liar 1"' howled the Sergeant.&#xD;
"Be he the highest of all the land, I will here now, and tp&#xD;
his teeth, pronounce him an infamous slanderer."&#xD;
"And I! and I!" shouted both Kenton and the black.&#xD;
" God bless you for what you have said," exclaimed Bryan,&#xD;
wringing the hand of iDuffe; "free my father's name from this&#xD;
dark charge, and you will make h Lis orphan son happy in spite&#xD;
of all his other woes."&#xD;
" Your gallant father's fame has no stain resting upon it,"&#xD;
replied the Sergeant, with eager haste; "1for he lived and died&#xD;
a true patriot, enjoying the love and esteem of his general, and&#xD;
of all those whose esteem was worth having."&#xD;
"But how comes it," inquired Bryan, "that General De&#xD;
Lacy and Montlack have branded his memory with this griev-&#xD;
ous charge, and that, too, to his son? Were there no grounds&#xD;
for -this base slander?"&#xD;
" A miserable and petty foundation, believed by none but&#xD;

the -envious and malicious," replied Duffe, contemptuously,&#xD;
and as if the charge scarcely required a refutation.&#xD;
"But what was it?" asked Bryan, anxiously.&#xD;
"A  letter was found, directed to the British general, and&#xD;
signed with the name of your father," replied Duffe; " but it&#xD;
was not in his handwriting, was not believed for a moment by&#xD;
any one that knew him to have been written by him, and was&#xD;
considered, by all, the base machination of some enemy (a&#xD;
fellow by the name of Girty was suspected) to injure him.&#xD;
Your father stood as high after that, in the estimation of the&#xD;
army and of General Greene, as he ever did at afiy period of&#xD;
the war."&#xD;
" And have you told me all, and held back nothing?"&#xD;
" All, so help me Heaven ! I have not concealed one jot or&#xD;
tittle; and willingly would I now fill his bloody grave, were I&#xD;
entitled to his honored name."&#xD;
"«Now do I breathe again," said Bryan, his countenance&#xD;
radiant with heartfelt joy; " and once more can I look the&#xD;
world in the face without fear and without disgrace. Forgive&#xD;
me, father! that I ever doubted for a moment your honor or&#xD;
patriotism--for never will I doubt again, though all the world&#xD;
cry traitor, and spit poison upon your grave !"&#xD;
" By the Eternal! I would like to hear any one, of this&#xD;
world, brand the name of my old friend and commander with&#xD;
treachery!1" hissed the excited Sergeant. "I would grind him&#xD;
beneath my heel as I would the head of a poison-spitting&#xD;
adder !"&#xD;
" Or ,a woman-scalpin' Ingen," added. the Scout, ominously,&#xD;
feeling the handle of his hunting-knife.&#xD;
Bryan could only look his thanks for the honest devotion of&#xD;
the two old soldiers for their colonel; and then, in a more cheer-&#xD;
ful voice, although his brow was still clouded with gloom and&#xD;
care, gave them a rapid account of his interview with .De Lacy,&#xD;
and the subsequent charge made by Montlack against himself ;&#xD;
adding, in conclusion---&#xD;
"But I care-nothing about this groundless slander against&#xD;

myself; for now that my father's fame has been purified, con-&#xD;
scious of my own innocence, I feel confident of soon freeing&#xD;
my name from all stain, and of' convicting this dark hypocrite&#xD;
of falsehood and treachery."&#xD;
IDuffe made no reply to this hopeful conclusion of Bryan;&#xD;
for he saw at a glance that he was in the power of a cunning&#xD;
villain, and one that would not hesitate to push matters to&#xD;
extremes, if he could thereby further his own interests. See-&#xD;
ing the situation of his foster-child in this light, the Sergeant's&#xD;
head sank despondingly upon his bosom, and he gave utterance&#xD;
only to a deep smothered groan.&#xD;
But Sharp-Eye, seeing the matter in an entirely different&#xD;
pase-for he believed the testimony of Titus and himself&#xD;
would amply prove the innocence of Bryan, and the guilt o&#xD;
iVNontlack--exclaimed, with eager haste-&#xD;
" I know'd it! blast my buttons, when I saw that ar' red-&#xD;
headed rascal and plotting Frenchman powwowing together, if&#xD;
I didn't know jist as well some devilment wer' hatching as if&#xD;
I'd seen an Ingen track prowlin' 'round the settlements. But&#xD;
never fear, Mister Bryan, for may the Shawanees roast meif&#xD;
I can't settle that ar' little affair 'bout the money as straight-&#xD;
forward and slick as the best lawyer in the country. Can't we,&#xD;
Bang?"&#xD;
The assistant counsellor, Bang, receiving new life from the&#xD;
cheery voice of his master, assented to his query with an ani-&#xD;
mated growl; but Bryan, by no means satisfied with this addi-&#xD;
tional affirmation of the Scout's power of proving his innocence,&#xD;
eagerly sought an explanation.&#xD;
"Nothing plainer," replied the bordered, with a mysterious&#xD;
wink at the grinning black, at the same time deliberately set-&#xD;
tling himself and crossing his legs, thinking, "Now I will have&#xD;
it all my own way, will take my time, and all in due season&#xD;
will let the cat out of the bag, and enjoy my honors; but, in&#xD;
the m an time, I will just ask a few questions for dignity's sake,&#xD;
to show off my shrewdness, and make believe that it was a&#xD;
very knotty case to unravel.'" There was a great lawyer lost&#xD;

&#xD;
to the country when Simon became a scout, and, acting up to&#xD;
these secret thoughts of his, looking gravely at Bryan, he&#xD;
asked--.&#xD;
But who the devil was that ar' fewer with the red head ?&#xD;
I mean the scamp that signed the paper 'long with the cussed&#xD;

"But how know you that, he had a red head ?" exclaimed&#xD;
Bryan, with surprise.&#xD;
"May-be I dreamed it-..=and may-be I didn't," replied Simon,&#xD;
with another knowing wink at Titus, the black returning his&#xD;
wink with interest, by shutting both eyes, and showing all of&#xD;
his teeth. "But it ain't got nothin' to do with this 'ere case,&#xD;
Mister Bryan, how I lamed that ar' fact6  So jist answer a&#xD;
civil question, and don't be axing me any."&#xD;
"He was introduced to me as a poor fisherman, by the name&#xD;
of Brant," replied Bryan; "but, when Iscame to examine the&#xD;
bond, I found that he had signed his name Simon Girty."&#xD;
Had Kenton sat down upon the head of a rattlesnake, or the&#xD;
back ofa porcupine, he could not have sprung up more rapidly&#xD;
than he did wheu he heard the name of the renegade; and his&#xD;
first exclamation, after a loud whistle of astonishment, was--&#xD;
"Bring out your cradle, Sargeant---if you've got any sich a&#xD;

milk, for I'm a poor baby, as blind as a bat in daytime, and as&#xD;
dull as a donkey with his ears cut off. Sharp-Eye, indeed I"&#xD;
he added, bitterly. "I've no more right to that name than the,&#xD;

Bryan. "I came by the old cabin, and this Brant, or Gir&#xD;

been occupied."&#xD;
"Well, Mister Bryan, it does go again my nat, an       a&#xD;

"Mercy! the devil!" exclaimed Sharp-Eye. "Who talks.&#xD;
'bout mercy ?  And do you 'spect it from sich a lyin', thievin'&#xD;
rascal as that? I'd as soon 'spect mercy from a bloody Ingen,&#xD;
when'he had my topknot in his hand, ad his knife all ready'&#xD;

"If what you say be true," exclaimed Bryan, rasping the&#xD;

fully exposed, and my own name freed from the dishonoring&#xD;

Bryan had listened with intense interest to this account of&#xD;
Kenton's; but, to the great surprise of the latter, who expected&#xD;
a sudden outburst of joy, the former not only showed no sign&#xD;
of exultation, but-still more astonishing to the honest bor-&#xD;

covering his face with his hands. And Duffe, 'too, to whom&#xD;
the Scout looked for an explanation, met his gaze with a ges-&#xD;

"It won't do, Simon," said Bryan, sadly; "for, although I&#xD;
would believe Titus as soon as any man living, still, the law&#xD;
will not permit him to give testimony, nor will. it allow you to&#xD;
testify upon the strength of what he has related to you."&#xD;
" Then let the law and the courts gd to the devil !" exlaimed&#xD;
the Scout; "and, if this 'ere plottin' Frenchman--for I believe&#xD;
he's got nigger blood in him..-.goes to trying' any of his traps&#xD;
on us, we'll jist gin him a taste of backwoods law, for it art a&#xD;
blamed sight better for sich fellers than any you've got here."&#xD;
There's some reason in what Sharp-Eye says," remarked&#xD;
the Sergeant, who had been silently turning the matter over in&#xD;
his own mind, "for there is no use in puzzling our brain about&#xD;
testimony, since this matter has not yet been brought before&#xD;
the courts, and we have every reason to believe that it will not&#xD;
be. If it does come to that point, then we will make the best&#xD;
defence in our power, and I am confident that innocence will&#xD;
triumph over guilt. For the present, the testimony of Sharp-&#xD;
Eye and Titus will be sufficient to convince Miss Coma; and,&#xD;
if I am not/mistaken, Bryan cared more for her good opinion-'&#xD;
than of all the balance of the world."&#xD;
" Jist the thing, Sargeant," exclaimed the Scout, glad of any&#xD;
way to get around the present difficulty. "And, blast me ! if I&#xD;
don't have you electedd judge of the first court we have out in&#xD;

"I thank you, Duffe, for your kind suggestion," added&#xD;
Bryan, when Kenton had finished his philippic against the&#xD;

"THAT ain't so bad, Mister Bryan; and s'posin' that yeller&#xD;
rascal had been tbar, you'd have spiled his appetite to a sar-&#xD;
tainty."                                             41&#xD;
Such was the remark of Kenton, as, with great gravity, he&#xD;
examined the mark of Bryan's bullet upon the target at which&#xD;
he was firing, and which Titus held up for his inspection.&#xD;
"But," added the Scout, as he made preparation for again&#xD;
loading the pistol, "though you shoot darned well for a green&#xD;
one, and this here popgun makes a blasted sight of fuss and a&#xD;
big hole for sich a small consarn, 'I ain't 'zactly satisfied with&#xD;
this 'ere way of doing up the business; for, s'posin' it wer' to&#xD;
happen that this 'ere Frenchman, after doing you all the harm&#xD;
he can, wer' to jist accidentally pink you, and get off himself&#xD;
without begin' hurt, that ar''wouldn't be so darned funny; and&#xD;
I guess it would be tarnation little satisfaction to be first in-&#xD;
sulted and then killed. Did you ever think of it in that ar'&#xD;
way, Mister Bryan ?"&#xD;
"(The chances are equal," said Bryan, "and there is no&#xD;
other way for a gentleman to wipe out an insult received."&#xD;
"Darn poor way, if he should happen to be wiped out him-&#xD;
self," grunted the Scout. "But here's the pistol; try your&#xD;
h&amp;amp;d again, and if you can shoot as well with the tother feller&#xD;
before you as you do now, he won't 'scape with a whole skin,&#xD;
and that ar' some consolation, anyhow."&#xD;
It had been a busy morning at the Sergeantk; for, whilst-&#xD;
Simon was trying the "narves of Mr. Bryan," as  called it,&#xD;
Duffe, with much zeal albd care, had been dragging from its&#xD;
sacred place of deposit his seedy suit of regimentals, and pre-&#xD;
paring it for immediate use. His wife lent a willing hand&#xD;
&#xD;
99&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
p.&#xD;
&#xD;
in furbishing up the blackened buttons and tarnished lace of&#xD;
this ancient suit, and she did so without question or remark,&#xD;
for she was one of those wise women who thought her husband&#xD;
knew best what he was about; and then she had no idea of the&#xD;
solemn occasion of its present disentombment, for the Sergeant&#xD;
never disturbed these sacred relics of the past, save on high&#xD;
days and militia musters, and the poor woman, not being overly&#xD;
curious (a rather remarkable trait for one of her sex), took it&#xD;
for granted that a training day had come, and so worked dili-&#xD;
gently on at the resurrected paraphernalia, and without one&#xD;
thought of seeking the cause of its resurrection. But in due&#xD;
time, this furbishing up, and polishing off, and brushing down,&#xD;
came to an end, and the tall, sinewy person of the Sergeant,&#xD;
encased in his regimentals, made its appearance at the door,&#xD;
followed to the threshold by the admiring eyes of his wife.&#xD;
Walking with the stiff, measured tread of a veteran, his fine&#xD;
athletic person showing off to much advantage in his worn&#xD;
and time-beaten uniform, 'Duffe slowly approached Bryan and&#xD;
Kenton; but he did not halt, or, if he did, it was only for a&#xD;
moment to make them a military salute, and then, without a&#xD;
word to either, passed on, marching with proud and precise&#xD;
step, in the direction of the De Lacy mansion.&#xD;
" Jist as natural as eatin'," exclaimed the Scout, admiringly,&#xD;
touching his cap in return to the salute of Duffe ; "and the&#xD;
very sight of that ar' old uniform makes-me ache with the&#xD;
thought of them cussed drillin's we used to go through in old -&#xD;
times. Halloo !" he added, as the Sergeant stalked away,&#xD;
" don't be forgettin' that ar' message I sent the Frenchman."&#xD;
Then turning to Bryan, with a last look at the vanishing form&#xD;
of Duffe, he remarked, with a well satisfied air, " He's one of&#xD;
'em, Mister Bryan, and we'll do up this 'ere business of. our'n&#xD;
to a sqar', so blaze away agin' at the 'tarnal rascal, and let's&#xD;
see the state of your narves."&#xD;
Sergeant Duffe, although not particularly blessed with the&#xD;
goods of this world, was very favorably known throughout the&#xD;
country, and on account of his honesty, and patriotism, and&#xD;

SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
tried bravery, was, if not cordially and upon intimate terms,&#xD;
at least politely received and welcomed by the most aristocratic&#xD;
of his neighbors, so that he found no difficulty in obtaining&#xD;
entrance to the house of General De Lacy, and no sooner had&#xD;
he- presented his sterns visage at the door, and inquired for&#xD;
Captain Montlack, than the bowing servant led him at once to&#xD;
the parlor, announcing with negro pomp and ceremony his&#xD;
name. There was no one in the room but the captain himself&#xD;
who, raising his head at the announcement of Duffe, with all&#xD;
the politeness -of his nation, arose quickly from his seat, x-&#xD;
claiming----&#xD;
"tra   truly glad to see you, Mr. Duffe. You look very&#xD;
natu~raand familiar in your uniform, and remind me very&#xD;
much of old times. But take a seat. Suppose you wish to&#xD;
see =the, general? He is out now, but will be back in a few&#xD;
minutes."&#xD;
" My business, this morning, is with you, captain," replied&#xD;
Duffe, returning the warm greeting of-Montlack with a stiff bow&#xD;
and military touch of the cap,. "and is such as to brook no&#xD;
delay and very little ceremony."&#xD;
Montlack had guessed the cause of the Sergeant's appearance&#xD;
so soon as he hadcaught'sight of his face and uniform; but, not-&#xD;
withstanding, chose to be very ignorant, and to this stiff reply&#xD;
to his warm welcome said, in the same pleasant voice, as if to-&#xD;
tally unconscious of his visitor's purpose :--&#xD;
" Eh, Sergeant, are you out giving notice to attend a train-&#xD;
ing? We captains of the war have- had a fall since peace&#xD;
was- declared, and are not only common soldiers now, but mi-&#xD;
litia at that, and commanded by our subalterns. Ha! ha !&#xD;
it would be a good joke if you had a notice for the general,&#xD;
and I would like right well to see you serve it on him."&#xD;
"I'm not on that business now," said Duffe, with freezing&#xD;
politeness.&#xD;
" Then to what may I ascribe the pleasure of your com-&#xD;
pany ?" inquired Montlack. -&#xD;
"I come, at the request of my friend Mr. Bryan Head, to .&#xD;

gentleman to another for an insult offered," replied Duffe,&#xD;
promptly, and again politely touching his cap.&#xD;
Although Montlack had been fully confident, from the first&#xD;
appearance of Duffe, of the intent of his visit, yet when he&#xD;
had thus clearly and unmistakably delivered his hostile nes-&#xD;
sage, in spite of every effort to the contrary he could not con-&#xD;
ceal his emotion, and, whilst his face turned deadly pale, stam-&#xD;
mnered forth-&#xD;
" My good sir, I am somewhat surprised at your language,&#xD;
and am not certain that I yet exactly understand the purport&#xD;
of -your message."&#xD;
"(Nothing plainer," replied Duffe, bluntly. "Did you not,&#xD;
last night, in the presence of General De Lacy and his daughter,&#xD;
grossly insult Mr. Head? and did he not then tell you he would&#xD;
require satisfaction at your hands? I come now, on his behalf,&#xD;
to know when you will give him the pleasure of a meeting, and&#xD;
to arrange everything necessary on such occasions with your&#xD;
friend, if you will be so good as to name him."&#xD;
Sacre! You speak plainly enough now," said Montlack,&#xD;
with a sneer, "and I am very sorry that I cannot gratify the&#xD;
young gentleman."&#xD;
"Captain Montlack certainly does not refuse to give Mr.&#xD;
Head the satisfaction he demands ?" said Duffe, with a look of&#xD;
surprise.&#xD;
" That is my determination," replied Montlack.&#xD;
"You will not refuse to give me the reason for this unex-&#xD;
pected conclusion of yours ?" said Duffe, struggling to be calm.&#xD;
"Certainly not, if you insist."&#xD;
" I do," said Duffe, sternly.  -&#xD;
"1Myreasons for declining a hostile meeting with your friend&#xD;
can soon be given," replied the captain; "and when you have&#xD;
heard them, Monsieur Duffe, I doubt not but you, like myself,&#xD;
will consider them amply sufficient."&#xD;
"I await your pleasure, for, if you continue to decline giving&#xD;
my friend the satisfaction he claims of you as a gentleman,&#xD;

102                  SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
then, of course  I claim itas but due to myself to know the&#xD;
ground of your refusal."&#xD;
"I most certain do decline this meeting," said Montlack,&#xD;
but with some hesitation, as he noticed the contracting brow&#xD;
of his visitor; "and as you insist upon my reason for so doing,&#xD;
it is simply because this Mr. Head is not only not my equal,&#xD;
but is the son of a spy, and himself a felon."&#xD;
It was a dreadful struggle for Duffe to restrain his anger;&#xD;
but with a mighty effort he did so; and to this insulting reply&#xD;
of the captaj, touching his cap with punctilious politeness, he&#xD;
remarked&#xD;
S"I trust, Captain Montlack, that you can have no such ob-&#xD;
jection to myself; and as you have positively refused to meet&#xD;
my principal, I now claim at your hands that honor."&#xD;
"Surely you are not serious ?" exclaimed Montlack, stepping&#xD;
back in astonishment.&#xD;
"Never more so," replied Duffe.&#xD;
"Why, really, Mr. Duffe," continued Montlack, "I am as-&#xD;
tonished at your. demand, and if you seriously seek a hostile .&#xD;
meeting with me, then I must decline, since I have no cause of&#xD;
enmity towards you, but, on the contrary, have for you tle&#xD;
very highest respect."&#xD;
"Which I am sorry to say I cannot reciprocate," replied the&#xD;
Sergeant, with some heat.  "'But, once for all, Captain Mont-&#xD;
lack, will you fight Mr. Head ?"&#xD;
"No. I have given a sufficient reason for refusing."&#xD;
"Then, will you fight me?"&#xD;
"I must also reply no; and I cannot understand why you&#xD;
make so strange a demand, since, in refusing your principal, I&#xD;
make no charge against you, but, on the contrary, acknowledge&#xD;
the very highest respect for you."&#xD;
"Will you permit me, captain," said Duffe, after a moment&#xD;
of silence, "to make a few remarks, not exactly pertaining to&#xD;
my present mission, but suggested by what has just occurred ?"&#xD;
"Most certainly," replied Montlack, with his wonted smile,&#xD;
"for I can assure you, Mr. Duffe, that I regret very much&#xD;
&#xD;
what has taken place, and trust that, although I do not con-&#xD;
sider myself bound to give this Mr. Head the satisfaction he&#xD;
has, I must say, rather impudently demanded of me, you will&#xD;
see the'propriety of my course, and attach no blame, to any&#xD;
one but the gentleman himself. As for the demand made by&#xD;
you, I look upon it in no other light than a punctilious fulfil-&#xD;
ment of the code of honor; for you surely have no grounds&#xD;
of ill-will against me, or for the hostile meeting you have&#xD;
sought."&#xD;
"I have grounds, and the very best of grounds, for the&#xD;
demand I have made," thundered the Sergeant, no longer able&#xD;
to control his anger, "for you have slandered, basely slandered,&#xD;
not only my foster-child, but. the memory of my old com-&#xD;
mander; and I here now brand you, Captain Montlack, and to&#xD;
your, very face, not only as an infamous hypocrite and defamer&#xD;
of the living, but as a malicious and wilful slanderer of the&#xD;
dead ; to which I will also add the merited titles of liar,&#xD;
scoundrel, and coward! Now, will you fight me?"&#xD;
"I have already answered you," sneered Montlack, "and&#xD;
think, as you have more than executed your mission, that you&#xD;
had now better take your departure. I might be tempted to&#xD;
have you thrown out by the servants."&#xD;
.  "Not before I have placed my seal to what I have said, and&#xD;
given you the coward's portion," retorted the Sergeant, at the&#xD;
same time administering to the captain's visage a buffet which&#xD;
sent him reeling to the extremity of the room.,-&#xD;
Stopping only long enough to meet the furious face of. Mont-&#xD;
lack and listen to his smothered oaths of vengeance, with a&#xD;
smile of scornful contempt the Sergeant turned upon his heel&#xD;
and left the room, not sufficiently ruffled, by this passage at&#xD;
arms, to make him forget to acknowledge, with military exact-&#xD;
ness, the bow of General de Lacy, whom he met upon the&#xD;
steps.&#xD;
. Ongmore at home, Duffe, with great apparent indifference,&#xD;
gave Bryan and Kenton the result of his mission, adding, in&#xD;
conclusion, that it was no use to make any further attempt,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC8248-00000054"/>&#xD;
OR) THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
for the captain, in addition to-being a knave, was in his opin-&#xD;
ion a most arrant coward.&#xD;
"Then, what is to be done ?" asked Bryan.&#xD;
"Horsewhip him ! horsewhip him !" exclaimed Duffe, in a&#xD;
pet; "that's the next step !"&#xD;
"No it tain't, either," said Kenton, "for such rascals don't&#xD;
care for a horsewhippin', and the next thing would be one of&#xD;
them darnation suits for damages. Jist bear a hand here, Sar-&#xD;
geant, and let me go, and I'll give you my scalp if I din't&#xD;
make this 'tarnal Frenchman toe the mark."&#xD;
Before either Bryan or Duffe had time to think, or raise any&#xD;
objection to this proposal, the Scout had whistled Bang, and&#xD;
was gone.-&#xD;
Fortune favored the borderer; for Montlack, after the visit and&#xD;
?departure of Duffe, thinking that he would be troubled with no&#xD;
more such visitors for that day at least, had, with the double&#xD;
purpose of preventing a meeting between the lovers and sooth-&#xD;
ing his own ruffled feelings, gone out to walk in the grounds;&#xD;
but scarcely had he strolled a half a milefwhen, at a short&#xD;
turn in the path he was leisurely pursuing, he came suddenly&#xD;
upon Kenton. Having never before seen the frontiersman, or&#xD;
at least for some years, Montlack did not recognize him, and had&#xD;
no suspicion of his being in any way connected either with Bryan&#xD;
or Duffe. He, therefore, without being disturbed at his pre-&#xD;
sence, went boldly on, and was about passing the Scout with a&#xD;
slight nod, when the latter, touching his cap, exclaimed--&#xD;
"Halloo, Mr. Capting, if you ain't in too all-fired a great&#xD;
hurry, I would jist like to have a word with you !"&#xD;
"You are very familiar, my good fellow, for one of your'&#xD;
cloth," replied Montlack, with a rather contemptuous stare at&#xD;
the uncouth dress of Simon.&#xD;
" That's me, 'zactly, capting; I always wer' familiar on a short&#xD;
acquaintance, 'specially with Ingen scalps, bears, rascals, and&#xD;
sich like--war'n't I, Bang ?"&#xD;
Bang having fully endorsed the impudence of his master,&#xD;
&#xD;
the captain, after another long stare at the odd couple before&#xD;
him, said angrily-&#xD;
"Your impudence places me in rather a difficult category,&#xD;
for I must either be an Indian, bear, or rascal; and as I do not&#xD;
lay claim to either of these honorable titles, I beg that you&#xD;
will exercise your familiarity with some other person."&#xD;
"As to that ar' Category you speak consarning of," replied&#xD;
Sharp-Eye, with a provoking laugh, a1I guess I don't know&#xD;
nothin' at all about him; but as to Ingens, or bears, capting,&#xD;
I don't stand back for any man alive. You ain't an Ingen,&#xD;
capting, for I rather think you are a leetle too black; nor are&#xD;
you a bear, though, tb tell the truth and shame the devil, you&#xD;
have got some of the ways of that ar' varmint. 'But, if you&#xD;
mightn't consider it too bold or too presumptions-like in a&#xD;
feller of my cloth, capting, I would jist like to ask, to satisfy&#xD;
my curiosity, if you ain't got some nigger blood in you?"&#xD;
" Sacred! you low-flung rascal! do you mean to insult me?"&#xD;
shouted Montlack, becoming furious at the cool effrontery of&#xD;
his questioner.&#xD;
"Sacre, the devil !" grinned Sharp-Eye, for he was enjoying&#xD;
the fury of his victim; " who wer' sayin' anything 'bout sacre?&#xD;
I wer' jist axing you a civil question 'bout your nigger rela-&#xD;
tions, and blame me if I don't b'lieve you are gittin' mad."&#xD;
.«"See here, fellow," said Montlack, becoming cool from the&#xD;
very excess of his fury, "stand aside at once, and let me pass,&#xD;
for I wish to hear no more of your impudence."&#xD;
"Impudence, Mr. Capting," replied the Scout, with a quiet&#xD;
wink of the eye, "you war'n't never more mistaken in all your&#xD;
life-not even when you thought yourself a beauty or a gen-&#xD;
tleman. Why,-I wer' always considered the modestest kind of&#xD;
a man, and wer' never thought impudent but once, and that&#xD;
wer' at Squire Boone's great quiltin', when I kissed all the&#xD;
gals, not even 'cepting the niggers. I tell you, capting, that&#xD;
wer' aswonderful mistake of your'n; worse than that ar' Cate-&#xD;

" That's jist what I said to a dratted grisly bear once;&#xD;
but he wouldn't go away himself, nor would he let me go."&#xD;
"I will not be bothered with you longer," shouted Mont-&#xD;
lack, "and if you do not let me pass, will turn upon my path&#xD;

"That's jist whar we differ, capting," replied the Scout, with&#xD;
a slight "shrug of his shoulders, "for though that 'tarnal yallei"&#xD;

"First tell me, capting," inquired Kenton, with apparent&#xD;
earnestness, "if you ain't got some nigger blood in your veins,&#xD;
for I'm particularly anxious to know, and have a reason for&#xD;
axing the question."&#xD;
"No !" thundered Montlack, fairly badgered into a reply;&#xD;
"and now, as I have answered your impudent question, maybe&#xD;
you. will be good enough to let me know your name and busi-&#xD;

"Not till I say so, capting," replied Kenton, changing his&#xD;

"lion Dieu! if you do not wish to run me mad, say at once&#xD;
what you want," exclaimed Montlack.&#xD;
"That's jist what I'm after," replied Simon, with impertur-&#xD;
hable gravity, "and am darned glad your dander is on the riz.&#xD;
But I don't want any of your African lingo, capting, for you&#xD;

oon' me any more; for if you do, tarnation take me if I don't&#xD;
knock that black face of your'n into the middle of next week."&#xD;
Montlack grasped the barrel of his rifle, as if he would fain&#xD;
use it over the head of his tormentor; but, catching-the steady&#xD;
gleam of Kenton's eye, he quickly smothered his desire ; and&#xD;
the Scout, who had watched every motion of his hand and eye,&#xD;
seeing that his heart had failed him, said with a laugh-&#xD;
'"Well, now, capting, since you've got no nigger blood in&#xD;
you-though cuss me if I can see 'zactly how you come to be&#xD;
so blamed black without it-I'll jist come to the pint right off.&#xD;

"Are you here, too, about that Mr. Head ?" exclaimed&#xD;
Montlack, with a groan.                                 -&#xD;
"'Zactly," replied Kenton, drawling it out; "that's jist my&#xD;

nerves at a little spot 'bout the size of one of them ar' buttons&#xD;

none of your accidental shots, but always plumb up to the mark.&#xD;
If he don't spile that, ar' coat of your'n, then burst me if I&#xD;

"What does all this jargon mean.?" exclaimed Montlack,&#xD;

"«For mercy's sake stop your blathering, and.tell me what&#xD;

women-folks are 'bout. He wer'n't fotched up right, capting."&#xD;
"Did he send you with this message?" said Montlack, be-&#xD;
coming more cool, now that he had discovered the business.of&#xD;
his strange interrogator.&#xD;
" That's neither here nor thar, capting; the question is,&#xD;
will you fight?"&#xD;
"I have already declined a meeting with your Mr. Bryan,&#xD;

"But I will not !" exclaimed Montlack, angrily; "and you&#xD;

"But this will be downright murder," exclaimed Montlack,&#xD;
with some alarm, "and you dare not execute your threat."&#xD;
I dare do anything," said Kenton, with solemn firmness.&#xD;
You may jist call it downright murder, or downright what&#xD;
you please; but I calls it downrightscalping, which ar' pretty&#xD;

never enjoyed that ar' pleasure, you can now look upon Simon&#xD;

" You Simon Kenton1" exclaimed Montlack, starting back&#xD;
in surprise; "1I can scarce believe you."&#xD;
" I've no doubt you are surprised," replied Kenton, with a&#xD;
slight sneer of contempt at the astonishment depicted upon the&#xD;
face of Montlack; " but still, surprise or no surprise, I'm Cap-&#xD;

And now, capting, as you know me, I'll just state another one&#xD;

or be scalped without fightin'; so make your choice, for I ain't&#xD;
goin' to stay here all day tryin' to persuade you to be a gentle-&#xD;

Finding himself in a very bad "category" indeed, worse&#xD;
than the firsehe had so much complained of, the captain stood&#xD;
a moment, as if in deep thought,then stammered forth:&#xD;
" I have refused to fight with Mr. Head, because I consider&#xD;
him beneath my notice; but as to you, captain, I have no such&#xD;
grounds for declining, since I acknowledge you my equal, and&#xD;
if I had any cause of enmity"-&#xD;
" Whit do you call a cause ?" exclaimed. Kenton, interrupt-&#xD;
ing him. " I've cause enough myself, and if you'll only jist&#xD;
tell me how I can give you a cause-which, darned if I ain't&#xD;
been tryin' to do all this time-then cuss me if don't give you&#xD;
all the cause of enmity you desire, for fight you must, either&#xD;

horse pistols, "or with rifles; or, if you don't like these, then&#xD;

" This is rather a novel duel, captain; but as neither of us&#xD;
has a second, I propose that we stand back to back, and,&#xD;
at a signal to be given by you, that we each walk ten paces,&#xD;
and wheel, and fire."&#xD;
Kenton, having no suspicion of treachery on the part of&#xD;
Montlack, assented without hesitation to his proposal, and the&#xD;
next moment the bold frontier man and wily Frenchman had&#xD;
taken their places.-&#xD;
"Now!" exclaimed Kenton; but scarcely had he gone five&#xD;
paces before the ball of Montlack, who had not moved whistled&#xD;
close by his ear.'&#xD;
Turning quickly around, the blue eye of Kenton flashed for&#xD;
a noent with deadly lustre upon the treacherous Frenchman;&#xD;
buttrontlack, exclaiming with eager haste that it was an acci-&#xD;
dent, and expressing a hope that he was unhurt, the Scout's&#xD;
anger passed away at once, and with a countenance again-un-&#xD;
clouded he replied:--&#xD;
" It would have been darned unlucky tohave been killed by&#xD;
accident, capting, and just when you were about to do it in a&#xD;
genteel way. Cuss me if I wouldn't "rather die ten times in-&#xD;
ten tionally than once accidentally, for P can't see the sense of&#xD;
&#xD;
110&#xD;
&#xD;
1II&#xD;
&#xD;
dyin' when nobody wants you, and you ain't 'spectin' it your-&#xD;
self. Thar's jist no use or satisfaction inan accidental death,&#xD;
and I'm tetotaciously obliged that you didn't accidentally&#xD;
shoot an inch or more to the right; for if you had, capting,&#xD;
you'd have spiled as nice a scalp as wer' ever stuck on a man's&#xD;
head. But never mind, capting, accidents will happen in the&#xD;
best regulated families, they say; and as this 'ere wer' an acci-&#xD;
dent, then let it go as one, though cuss me if I can 'zactly see&#xD;
how it happened."&#xD;
"'Pon my honor, it was purely an accident," exclaimed&#xD;
Montlack, hastening to wipe away all suspicion from.the breast&#xD;
of his opponent.&#xD;
"I guess it wer' an accident that I wer'n't killed," said the&#xD;
Scout, dryly ; " but that's neither here nor thar now, and as&#xD;
you've let off one of them ar' 'little children,' capting, why it&#xD;
only follows that we must jist try the full-grown roarers. How&#xD;
shall it be?--forty steps and blaze away, or behind trees, in the&#xD;
Ingen fashion ?"&#xD;
" I would prefer that it should be neither," replied Montlack,&#xD;
"for, as I came very near shooting you accidentally, I would hate&#xD;
to do so now intentionally."&#xD;
" Thar's jist whar we differ, capting; for if you had killed&#xD;
me accidentally, I'd never forgiven you; but if you do so inten-&#xD;
tionally, you have my full permission. Fight we must, for&#xD;
that 'ere 'category' we were speakin' consarnin' of, I guess&#xD;
wer'n't blown away by that ar' little accident of your'n, but ar&#xD;
still somewhere about."&#xD;
" If such be your settled determination," said Montlack, a&#xD;
brilliant thought at this moment flashing across his plotting&#xD;
mind, for he had no idea of fighting if he could get clear of it,&#xD;
"then I'll fight you in your own way, each of us taking a tree,&#xD;
and- firing when we see proper."&#xD;
" Whoop! hurrah!" shouted Kenton, throwing up his cap;&#xD;
" now we'll have fun, capting. 'Tis jist the thing, and I par-&#xD;
don you that ar' little accident, since it has fotched about this&#xD;
~'ere 'kind of fightin'. It will 'mind me of old times out in&#xD;

Kaintuck, and thatsyaller face .of your'n dodgin' around the&#xD;
trees will look as na~t-al as life. Take your tree; here's mine."&#xD;
"Since I have agreed to fight you in your own way, with&#xD;
which I am not at all acquainted, you must pledge me your word&#xD;
of honor, Captain Kenton," said Montlack, preparing to execute&#xD;
his ruse, "that you will take no advantage of me, and will not&#xD;
look out from behind your tree until I have chosen mine and&#xD;
given the word."&#xD;
4 You have it," replied Kenton, "and.needn't fear any acci-&#xD;
dents on my part."&#xD;
"Then mind your promise," remarked Montlack, with a&#xD;
smile of cunning, as he walked quickly away, and on the op-&#xD;
posite side of the tree chosen by the Scout.&#xD;
Five-ten--fifteen minutes had gassed, and Kenton was&#xD;
growing restless and anxious for the signal of the captain; but&#xD;
mindful of:his promise not to look out, he manfully kept his&#xD;
post, though, to tell the truth, he did begin to think the captain.&#xD;
very particular in his choice of a tree.&#xD;
Five minutes more had passed, and the waiting borderer, no&#xD;
longer able- to restrain his eagerness for the fight, shouted out--&#xD;
"Hello, capting, darnation take me, can't you find a tree to&#xD;
suit you ?"&#xD;
The captain made no answer, and the Scout, after waiting&#xD;
five minutes longer, his suspicions in the mean time becoming&#xD;
somewhat excited, muttered impatiently---&#xD;
"Wall,, drat me if this don't beat all! May-be the ras-&#xD;
eal ar' waitgpg for me to show my scalp, that he may try one&#xD;
of them ar accidents agin ? I'll hold on a little longer,&#xD;
though cuss me if I couldn't have -laid an ambush, and killed&#xD;
a half dozen Ingens by this time."&#xD;
A fe* moments rolled by, and the impatient borderer,&#xD;
becoming still more restless, once more muttered to himself-.&#xD;
"Wall, I did-promise not to look out till he had found&#xD;
his tree and gin me the word-and I won't break my promise;&#xD;
but I'll jist go round this confounded piece of timber, with&#xD;
my back front forward, and let him blaze away if he please;&#xD;

Suiting the action to the word, Sharp-Eye slowly backed&#xD;
around the tree, momentarily expecting the bullet of his oppo-&#xD;
nent; but when once fairly on the opposite side, turning his&#xD;
face quickly in the direction Montlack had taken, to his very&#xD;
great astonishment he beheld that worthy some half a mile&#xD;
distant, hurrying, at a rapid pace, towards the mansion of&#xD;
General De Lacy !&#xD;
"Whew !" whistled Kenton, shaking his fist at the vanish-&#xD;
ing person of his foe, "fooled agin by the eternal Moses! but&#xD;
won't I make him smoke for this yet? Ingen, Frenchman, or&#xD;
nigger-and tarnation blame me if I don't believe he's got&#xD;
nigger blood in bim-he's thrown dust into my peepers this&#xD;
time. Come, Bang, this 'ere civerlized country don't suit us;&#xD;
let's be off at once, or we'll forget all we ever know'd. We&#xD;
were thought some, out in Kaintuck; but here we are jist no-&#xD;

bloody thief Girty first made a, fool on us; but that wer'n't&#xD;
so bad; then we made fools of ourselves, 'specting old Titus&#xD;
could be a witness; and now, worse than all, that skulkin' yal-&#xD;
ler devil of a Frenchman has played us round his finger,&#xD;
laughed at us, and left us. Blasted ninnies that we were,&#xD;
standing like fools behind a tree,. while he walked away!&#xD;

at us!' Whew! it makes me sick, and darned if I'll ever look&#xD;
out from behind a tree agin without a wrench at the stomachi"&#xD;
Tricked and defeated, Kenton walked away crestfallen and&#xD;
grumbling, and Bang, if you judged him by his drooping&#xD;
head and tail, fully sympathized with the discomfiture of his&#xD;
master.&#xD;

CHAPTER X.&#xD;
"HE's a 'tarnal coward, as sure as shoot'n', and of the foxy&#xD;
specie; and what's more, has got nigger blood in him !" ex-&#xD;
claimed the Scout, in conclusion of the graphic account of&#xD;
the meeting between himself and Montlack.&#xD;
" He was rather too much -for an unsophisticated backwoods-&#xD;
man!" said Duffe, smiling. 4&#xD;
"Un--un--un what?     But never mind; I reckon you&#xD;
don't mean anything wrong by that ar' jaw-breakin' word of&#xD;
your'n, Sargeant; and I 'knowledge the corn that I wer' done&#xD;
for by the yaller rascal; and so does Bang, and :so does all on&#xD;
us, I guess; but thar's no use cryin' over spilt milk: and it will&#xD;
be dratted strange if our time don't come round afore he gets&#xD;
to be an honest man !"&#xD;
The Scout had finished his narrative, and Bryan, smiling at&#xD;
the mortification he exhibited, both in his words and looks, at&#xD;
being 'outwitted by Montlack, left him to the tender mercy of&#xD;
the Sergeant, and strolled listlessly off into the woods.&#xD;
In leaving his companions, Bryan had no particular intent&#xD;
or purpose in view, although, without knowing why, he went&#xD;
in the direction of General De Lacy's. At any rate, he had&#xD;
no hope or expectation of meeting his enemy the captain; but&#xD;
perhaps,-unconsciously, had a faint notion or presentiment that,&#xD;
somehow or other (what lover has not experienced the same?),&#xD;
though the chances were, against him, he would get to see&#xD;
Coma, and, may-be, meet with an opportunity of making&#xD;
known to her his own innocence-and love, and the deep plot of&#xD;
his treacherous rival.&#xD;
And this mission of love'was destined to be far more suc-&#xD;
cessful than the warlike embassies of the Sergeant and Ken-&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.            115&#xD;
ton; for Coma, impelled by hopes very iear akin to those of&#xD;
her lover, discovering that Captain Jean had sullenly deter-&#xD;
mined to remain in doors for the remainder of the day, took&#xD;
advantage of this domestic freak of his, to steal cautiously from&#xD;
her room, and hurry to the usual trysting-place of herself and&#xD;
Bryan. But she did not go joyfully forth to the anticipated&#xD;
meeting with her lover; for, in truth, there was no gladness in&#xD;
poor Coma's heart, and as yet nothing but darkness, gloom, and&#xD;
doubt. Still, he had whispered her to believe him innocent&#xD;
until they had .met again, and she was determined to do so,&#xD;
though it was love and heart struggling faintly against reason&#xD;
and conviction. Yet, although desponding, she had that last&#xD;
refuge of the miserable and despairing-a lingering hope; and&#xD;
that hope, the brightest child of Mercy, even though small and&#xD;
weak, and almost pulseless now, was sufficient to bear her up,&#xD;
and with a sunshine smile led her on and on, till, with a cry of&#xD;
renewed confidence, she had once more fallen trustingly upon&#xD;
the throbbing bosom of- her lover !&#xD;
"And you will doubt no longer ?" exclaimed Bryan, with&#xD;
rapturous emotion, pressing to his heart her shrinking form.&#xD;
"Never more," she whispered.&#xD;
"Let that cunning cousin of yours say what he may ?" added&#xD;
the lover.&#xD;
"False once,-°false always. I will believe him no more,"&#xD;
was her trusting reply.&#xD;
"And your father ?" muttered the lover, doubtingly.&#xD;
"Can never lessen my love, or shake my confidence in you&#xD;
now," murmured Coma, looking up confidingly into his face.&#xD;
"Then, let what will happen," he-melaimed, with proud&#xD;
energy, "let sorrow, and shame, and poverty fall upon me, I&#xD;
will ever be to thee, Coma, as I am now. Is it so?"&#xD;
"Ever," was her firm, but lute-toned reply.&#xD;
"Now I am happy !" exclaimed the~ satisfied lover, "and&#xD;
defy the world, with all its dark cares, and sorrows, and sins,&#xD;
ever again to cast a gloom cloud across my heart, sustained, as&#xD;
it now is and will be, by your unwavering love !"&#xD;

&#xD;
For a moment, the lover sat in silence, as if afraid to break&#xD;
the charmed spell: fully enjoying that mingling together. of&#xD;
soul with soul; that secret mesmeric communing of spirit with&#xD;
spirit; that total forgetfulness of past sorrows and present&#xD;
dangers in the sunny shadowing of the glorious future-that&#xD;
unseen, intangible, indescribable ethereal; that sweet low&#xD;
vibration of the pulsating heart, bringing along with it music,&#xD;
and song, and genius; governing all, and governed by none;&#xD;
and known in man's vocabulary. as. Love! Fully,' and freely,&#xD;
and gushingly, now that all doubts had been removed, did this&#xD;
fairy spirit, like the bright waters of an ever bubbling spring,&#xD;
overflow and infuse itself throughout their hearts; and for the&#xD;
time, Bryan and Coma were supremely happy, forgetful alike&#xD;
of the Past, the Present, and the Future, and knowing naught&#xD;
else but that they were in each other's arms, loving and loved.&#xD;
Their souls were cloudless now; but dark shadows were creep-&#xD;
ing on and around them, and'though they knew it not, and&#xD;
felt it not, Coma, even then, as if gifted with the spirit of&#xD;
divination, with a low sigh, that charmed spell giving place to'&#xD;
prophetic imaginings of coming evil, murmured-&#xD;
"Oh! Bryan! who would have thought the soul of man so&#xD;
dark and treacherous? And who can I trust, now that Cousin'&#xD;
Jean, seemingly so kind, and generous, and noble, has proved&#xD;
so wicked and faithless ?"&#xD;
"Trust on me, dear one," exclaimed the lover, his face beam-&#xD;
ing with honesty and sympathy; "and if ever I prove-false to&#xD;
thee, even in word, thought, or deed, then may my soul g'o&#xD;
down to the grave in sorrow and gloom, without °a pleasant&#xD;
memory of the pas4 or hope of the future!. But how came&#xD;
you, Coma, at this moment of indescribable happiness, to think&#xD;
of that heartless villain ?"y&#xD;
"I know" not, Bryan; for, like the wind we see moving the&#xD;
leaves of the tree, and feel. kissing with cool lips our fevered&#xD;
cheek, it has come and gone; but where from, and where to, and&#xD;
for what reason; I am unable to say. But may-be," she con-&#xD;
tinued in a sad voice, "that the thought of him, at such a&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
117&#xD;
&#xD;
moment as this, is a shadowing forth of approaching evil; and&#xD;
O Bryan! I do fear him,-and tremble when I think of his dark&#xD;
hypocrisy and treachery."&#xD;
"I fear him not!" exclaimed Bryan, "now that you know&#xD;
his falsehood, and can brush from your guileless heart the&#xD;
poison of his adder tongue; and believe me all the more inno-&#xD;
cent, as he would make you think me dark and sinful! I feared&#xD;
him once, but only feared him because I knew that you were&#xD;
ignorant of his cunning treachery; but now that you know all,&#xD;
I feel towards him as I would to a hideous poisonous spider'!&#xD;
If he keeps within his web, I'll pass him by with contempt;&#xD;
but, if ever his loathsome form shall number my path, I'll&#xD;
grind him to atoms beneath my feet!"&#xD;
"Promise me, Bryan," said Coma, alarmed at his fierce look,&#xD;
"that you will seek no difficulty with this plotting cousin of&#xD;
mine; for he is base and treacherous, and'I fear his aroused&#xD;
malice."&#xD;
"No fear of him," said Bryan, contemptuously, "for with&#xD;
all his other faults, he has not the redeeming trait of bravery;&#xD;
but has shown himself as cowardly as knavish ! Already have&#xD;
I sought at his hands the only reparation he could make me&#xD;
for the insults and injuries offered me in your presence; but&#xD;
like a base coward that he is, the felon and slanderer refused,&#xD;
and upon the ground thatI was beneath him, and a criminal!&#xD;
I would be base and low indeed if beneath or more criminal&#xD;
than the traitorous plotting Captain Jean!-"&#xD;
"I do not fear that he will do you corporeal injury," said&#xD;
Coma, with a proud glance at the active and graceful form of&#xD;
her lover, "but 0! I do fear his secret, crawling malice! My&#xD;
God!"' she continued, with ;more agitation, as if suddenly&#xD;
struck with the dreadful thought, "what if he should attempt&#xD;
to execute that horrid threat he made of giving you over into&#xD;
the power of the law?   Tell me! 0 tell me, Bryan, is' it&#xD;
more than one of his wicked threats, or are you really in dan-&#xD;
ger from his malice and treachery ?"&#xD;
"I am innocent, Coma," replied Bryan firmly, but sadly;.&#xD;

"and have a confidence that God will not permit falsehood and&#xD;
wickedness to triumph over truth and innocence. Yet I will&#xD;
not conceal from you that, if this depraved cousin of yours shall&#xD;
press this charge, as he threatens to do, and will swear to his&#xD;
present false and groundless statement, then I would be in very&#xD;
great danger of falling a victim to his enmity; and the chances&#xD;
are. against me."&#xD;
"0 Bryan, what shall we do? what shall we do to soften&#xD;
the hatred of this wicked man ?" exclaimed Coma, clasping her&#xD;
hands in agony, and gazing with sorrowful eagerness into the&#xD;
eyes of her lover.&#xD;
"Nothing!" was his short, stern reply; "nothing, dear&#xD;
Coma-for sooner would I moulder in a dungeon, and have&#xD;
my name forever blackened with infamy and disgrace, than&#xD;
take. one step towards seeking the mercy or pity of this infa-&#xD;
mous hypocrite. iHe may go on with his hatred and treachery;&#xD;
but'I will meet him with a bold front, as a guiltless man, and&#xD;
can look down upon him and scorn him, though he succeed ip&#xD;
his malicious undertaking, and incarcerate me in a prison.&#xD;
But cheer up, dear one;, for he has not yet executed his threat,&#xD;
and may repent, or fear to take this bold leap beyond the con-&#xD;
fines of truth and honesty."&#xD;
"No! no! believe it not; Bryan,",said Coma, weeping; "for&#xD;
he that would be guilty of the treachery of which Jean has&#xD;
already been guilty would tremble at no other guilt, would&#xD;
draw back at no other crime, and would hesitate at no other&#xD;
sin. - No! no! you are lost! lost! and the wicked and false will&#xD;
triumph, unless God comes to the rescue, or you find some&#xD;
means of proving your.innocence."&#xD;
"Give not away to, your fears, Coma," said Bryan, cheer-&#xD;
ingly, "for all is not yet lost. The law is terrible, very terri-&#xD;
ble to theguilty; but remember,,it is also the safeguard and pro-&#xD;
tection of the innocent. I have great confidence, once this&#xD;
matter is placed under the cognizance and control of the courts,&#xD;
that the truth will be sifted out, and the innocent go forth&#xD;
without a stain; whilst the guilty one, caught in his own* toils,&#xD;

will receive the merited scorn and contempt of every honest&#xD;
man. Then cheer up, ear one, and smile again. Do not&#xD;
weep and despair before t e storm cometh, for it may never be&#xD;
here; and the raging winds have not yet given even a token of&#xD;
its approach."&#xD;
"But it will come," returned Coma, sadly, although slightly&#xD;
cheered by the firm voice of her lover; " for it only sleepeth,&#xD;
Bryan, and will burst upon us when we least expect it, tearing&#xD;
and rending all before it; and 0! if you, the strong man, are&#xD;
prostrated by the tempest, what will become of your poor&#xD;
Coma ?"&#xD;
"Never fear! this false-tongued hypocrite has not my.fate&#xD;
so entirely under his control. Remember! I have witnesses to&#xD;
prove his intimacy with the renegade- Girty, and that they&#xD;
were in company on the very day the bond was given. This&#xD;
evidence will go a great way to show his treachery, and will,&#xD;
at least, prove to your father that our enemy spoke falsely&#xD;
when he finished his knavery by denying his signature and&#xD;
all knowledge of his base accomplice."&#xD;
"True !" exclaimed Coma, with a hopeful smile. "You are&#xD;
right, Bryan, and we will not bow to 'this arch traitor. God&#xD;
will lay open the cunning devices of my malevolent cousin; and&#xD;
all honest men will see at once his trickery and wickedness.&#xD;
Sin may triumph for a season, and hypocrisy get the better of&#xD;
truth; but the vail will be rent asunder at last, and the hideous&#xD;
monster will be able no longer to conceal his deformity."&#xD;
" And in due time," said the lover, in the same confident&#xD;
tone, " whether our enemy shall attempt to execute his threat&#xD;
or not, I will show to your father his baseness and deceit ; and&#xD;
I will also prove to him that he unwittingly defamed the cha-&#xD;
racter of my gallant parent, and that there is no foundation for&#xD;
the 'heavy charge against his fame."&#xD;
" Bless you for these consoling. words," murmured Coma,&#xD;
hope and joy once more taking the place of despair and sorrow.&#xD;
"We will be happy yet, in spite of the malice and hatred of&#xD;

"And sweetheart of a soldier's son," exclaimed Bryan,&#xD;
gayly.-&#xD;
" Ay, and sweetheart of a soldier's son," added Coma,&#xD;
blushing, "meet all dangers that may arise with a bold heart,&#xD;

"list !" exclaimed Sharp-Eye, as, bounding over a little&#xD;
knoll, he stood in the presence of the lovers, "the inimy are&#xD;
on the trail, and I guess you ain't particklar anxious to meet&#xD;
them jist now."&#xD;
Kenton, thinking that Bryan had gone forth in search of&#xD;
Montlack, without more ado had followed his footsteps, intend-&#xD;
ing to be in at the rencounter, and see that the captain did all&#xD;
things fairly, and was guilty of no more accidents; but finding&#xD;
that the meeting was likely to be more loving than hostile, the&#xD;
Scout quickly retired beyond sight of the lovers, placing him-&#xD;
self, however, at a convenient distance between them- and the&#xD;
mansion of De Lacy, where he remained upon watch, guarding&#xD;
their, privacy, until he beheld the general, in company with&#xD;
iMontlack, approaching, when he immediately, as we have,&#xD;
already shown, bounded over the concealing knoll and gave the&#xD;
alarm.&#xD;
" Why are you here, and what do you mean, and what ene-&#xD;
mies are you speaking about ?" exclaimed Bryan, sharply, for&#xD;
he was in no humor to be thus interrupted, and suspected&#xD;
the Scout of being an intentional eye-witness of the meeting&#xD;
between himself and Coma.&#xD;
"I 'spected you wer' after the captain, Mister Bryan; but&#xD;
when I saw how it wer', I thought it mightn't be far wrong&#xD;
jist to step over the hill thar and keep a lookout for interlopers,&#xD;
till you had had your talk. So Bang and me jist kept up a&#xD;

'ere way, when we thought it wer' 'bout time to draw in the&#xD;
outposts and give the alarm."&#xD;
" Thank you, Simon, for your care and kindness," exclaimed&#xD;
Bryan, extending his hand to the Scout; "and you, too, Coma,&#xD;
must know this brave and generous man, for he loves me as a&#xD;
father, and you see how he watches over my safety."&#xD;
"I had often heard of you, captain," replied Coma, with a&#xD;
smile, "even before Bryan had told me of your love and care&#xD;
for him ; and now," she added, placing her soft, tiny hand in&#xD;
the rough [rasp of the borderer, "I want you still to. love and&#xD;
guard him, and also find, if you can, a little place in your heart&#xD;

"A little place, my blossom of the forest ?" said Kenton,&#xD;
with native-born gallantry; " why, it ar' all your'n- for the&#xD;
axing; and if it wer' as big as a camp-meetin', it wer' all the&#xD;
same, for you should have it for one of them sweet smiles.&#xD;
Cuss me if Mr. Bryan hadn't better look out, or he'll have&#xD;
Capting Kenton for a rival, instead of that darned Frenchman.&#xD;
I wouldn't be surprised if you jist took the whole on my heart,&#xD;
and drove Mr. Bryan clean out altogether; would you, Bang ?"&#xD;
Bang, as he was in a lady's company (unlike some puppies&#xD;
that we have seen), modulated his usual assent into a very low&#xD;
growl; but still sufficiently loud to attract the attention of&#xD;
Coma, who, patting him upon his shaggy head, by this simple&#xD;
act alone (so much does kindness influence both man and beast)&#xD;
not only insured the devotion of Sharp-Eye, but of Bang him-&#xD;
self, which was no trivial acqiirement, and which the brave&#xD;
dog, in after days, fully exhibited by his unwavering faithful-&#xD;
ness.&#xD;
"The yaller-skins are drawing near," exclaimed Kenton,&#xD;
peeping cautiously over the top of the little hillock; "and I&#xD;
guess you'd better be making tracks, Mister Bryan, if you-ain't&#xD;
got no notion of tryin' that 'tarnal rascal a blaze."&#xD;
" Remember ! Bryan," said Coma; "you have promised me&#xD;

have an opportunity, I will meet you here again." .&#xD;
"Farewell!" murmured Bryan, holding her hand (the Scout&#xD;
intentionally turning his back upon them); and, unpardonable&#xD;
sin, except on like occasions, he smothered her answering fare-&#xD;
well with a kiss.&#xD;
Touching his cap, Sharp-Eye bounded away, followed i by&#xD;
Bryan; and Coma was left to meet the suspicious glances of&#xD;
Montlack and lowering brow of her father.&#xD;
But she did it nobly; for love is equal in strategy, any day,&#xD;
to hatred and malice; and the quick, piercing rays of the cun-&#xD;
ning captain's burning orbs could read nothing in her smiling,&#xD;
face but a slight shade of sadness, mingled with a little natural&#xD;
surprise at the honor of their unexpected company.&#xD;
'Bah ! you life-long deceitful hypocrites, pride not your-&#xD;
selves upon your cunning! You are often made the victims of&#xD;
the most artless simplicity. The artful witness, priding him-&#xD;
self upon his shrewdness, with.- a well-conned story at his&#xD;
tongue's end, falls an easy victim to the skilful attorney; but&#xD;
save us from one of your say-nothing, simple fellows, is the&#xD;
prayer of all'the devout of the profession, for y.u often mark&#xD;
him down as a fool, when, in truth, he is doing that same honor&#xD;
for yourself.&#xD;
CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
HoPE, some one has beautifully remarked,&#xD;
"Shall sit upon the tossing waves of thought,&#xD;
As broods the halcyon on the troubled deep."&#xD;
And so it was now with Coma!&#xD;
With a little pardonable simplicity, or deceit if you will have it.&#xD;
so, for if the two are xo1 one and the same thing, they very fre-&#xD;
&#xD;
quently, in this rare old world of ours, go hand in hand together;&#xD;
then, I say, with a little pardonable simplicity or deceit (for all&#xD;
stratagems are fair, you know, in love, or war, or horse-swopping),&#xD;
Coma had completely (to use a common and very feeling expres-&#xD;
sion when literally executed) thrown dirt in the eyes of her&#xD;
father and Montlack, and concealed her recent meeting with&#xD;
her lover. But she was not so successful on the night following,&#xD;
when she again sat in the parlor at home along with her father&#xD;
and cousin; for the latter, believing, with the poet Eschylus,&#xD;
"when the heart conceives&#xD;
Thoughts of deep vengeance on a foe, what means&#xD;
To achieve the deed more certain, than to wear&#xD;
The form of Friendship ?"&#xD;
had, with smiles and' soft sighs, been fluttering around her;&#xD;
more than once hinting at his devotion, and hoping that she&#xD;
would look upon him now as she had done in olden times, and&#xD;
again call him her dear cousin Jean, as she was wont to do&#xD;
before the unlucky events of the last few days; and, perhaps&#xD;
-o what joy it would be to him!---might yet return his ardent&#xD;
affection.&#xD;
Coma for a long time bore his unceasing and deceitful mur-&#xD;
murings with a praiseworthy and martyr-like patience, and&#xD;
without saying anything that would reveal her late conversation&#xD;
with Bryan, and the discoveries she had ,made; and merely&#xD;
brushed from her thoughts, by unmeaning and indifferent re-&#xD;
plies, his unwished-for buzzing, as she had often done, with a&#xD;
careless brush of the hand, the melancholy, troublesome hum&#xD;
of the mosquito, which forever (and his conversation was very&#xD;
similar) seemed to .the annoyed ear, as if about to make an&#xD;
attack, but never exactly bringing its determination to a point;&#xD;
or rather, if you will allow us a legal pun, " filing its bill."&#xD;
But Captain Jean was not to be put off so, and like the&#xD;
Irishman's little bird, to which we have likened him, at last&#xD;
passed beyond the limits even of her indifference ; and after no&#xD;
inconsiderable amount of treacherous abuse (done by innuendo)&#xD;
upon the head of the absent Bryan, filed his bill with due&#xD;
&#xD;

ceremony by remarking ,that he had the commands of. her&#xD;
father to press his suit, and trusted that she would receive this&#xD;
offer of himself (the most valuable gift he had in the world)&#xD;
with a kindly sympathy&#xD;
"Yes !" exclaimed Coma, tortured almost to madness, and&#xD;
her whole soul burning with indignation at his continued hypo-&#xD;
crisy, "I will receive this valuable offer as it deserves, with&#xD;
scorn and contempt ! I know you now, base hypocrite and&#xD;
heartless villain that you are, and you can no longer deceive&#xD;
my simple heart with your honeyed words and pretended affec-&#xD;
tion ! He, that you would make me believe base and unde-&#xD;
serving, and upon whom you have been pouring your slanderous&#xD;
poison, is immeasurably above you in all that is honorable and&#xD;
praiseworthy; as much so, cunning plotter, as the heavens are&#xD;
above the earth !"&#xD;
If Montlack had placed his band in his bosom to draw forth&#xD;
the locket of his sweetheart, and instead thereof had grasped a&#xD;
slimy coiling snake, he could not have been more astounded&#xD;
than he was at this unexpected and bitter outburst of Coma.&#xD;
But recovering himself, after a quick glance at the general,&#xD;
wh9 sat in a distant part of the room looking forth from a win-&#xD;
dow, and finding that he had not noticed the excited voice of&#xD;
his daughter,. Montlack hissed from  between his compressed&#xD;
teeth-&#xD;
"Ha! does the wind lie in that direction, fair cousin ?  I&#xD;
had=believed you too noble ever again to have even a lingering&#xD;
thought of that base hound, now that he had proved himself&#xD;
so unworthy and so degraded !"&#xD;
" The Jews called Christ Beelzebub!" retort9d Coma,&#xD;
coldly.&#xD;
"What do you mean by that ?" asked Montlack, with a scowl&#xD;
of intense malice.&#xD;
"That the base and wicked were ever ready to decry the&#xD;
good, and vilify the characters of their betters I" replied Comah&#xD;

"I have other proof of his innocence," said Coma, coldly,&#xD;
" if that will be more satisfactory to my justice-loving cousin."&#xD;
"Who? What !" exclaimed Montlack, eagerly, his coun-&#xD;
tenance, in spite of all his efforts, growing pale and anxious.&#xD;
" Old Titus saw you when you signed that bond which you&#xD;
now pronounce a forgery; and was looking in upon you and&#xD;
your trusty friend Girty when you were preparing your hellish&#xD;
net to destroy an innocent man," replied Coma, exultingly.&#xD;
"Any one else ?" asked Montlack, drawing a long breath, as&#xD;
if greatly relieved, and speaking in a light, disparaging tone,&#xD;
for he wished not only to deceive Coma, but conceal his own&#xD;
uneasiness.&#xD;
"tHis word is sufficient," replied Coma.&#xD;
" Ha! ha! 'tis too good," laughed Montlack, with forced&#xD;
gayety; "almost equal to a comedy-a criminal proving inno-&#xD;
cence by his own words, backed by the testimony of a negro,&#xD;
and that negro his slave, and what is still better, convincing a&#xD;
silly girl by such indubitable proofs. Ha ! ha!, Excuse me,&#xD;
cousin, but I must laugh."-&#xD;
" Your mirth is very unseasonable, Monsieur Montlack,"&#xD;
replied Coma, haughtily, for she was Dot deceived, but greatly&#xD;
annoyed by his feigned amusement. "If, however, you feel&#xD;
disposed to be merry, I will no longer be a check upon your-&#xD;
mirth, but retire at once to my room."&#xD;
"Stay, stay, Coma !" exclaimed Montlack, checking quickly&#xD;
his merriment as he beheld his cousin preparing to leave him;&#xD;
";this trifling has lasted long enough, and we must now treat&#xD;
this affair seriously, and with the importance it deserves."&#xD;
" I await your wishes, sir," replied Coma, with chilling po-&#xD;
liteness.-&#xD;
"I have a right, Coma, as your relation, the nearest of blood&#xD;
to your father, and as -a suitor for your hand, accepted and&#xD;
acknowledged by your parent," said Montlack, gravely, and&#xD;
even sternly, dwelling with emphasis upon the words " accepted&#xD;

" I acknowledge no such right as you" claim," said Coma,&#xD;
proudly and firmly, "and think, Monsieur Montlack, that you&#xD;
are transgressing the strict rules of politeness and courtesy, or,&#xD;
in other words, to be plain with you,- are becoming unbearably&#xD;
presumptuous.. When I wish advice or counsel, I will seek it&#xD;

join him."&#xD;
" Stop, Coma, or your pride may meet with a fall," muttered&#xD;
the captain. "I have a proposition to make you, and if that&#xD;
fails," he added, sneeringly, " I will join you in your short&#xD;
journey across the room."&#xD;
"I am ready to hear you, sir," replied Coma, halting, " pro-&#xD;

" If it is your good pleasure," retorted Montlack, unable to&#xD;
resist a sneer, "I will say nothing more of my rights, but&#xD;
state at once, and as plainly as I am able, my wishes, and leave&#xD;
it with you to say yea or nay."&#xD;
"Go on; Iam all attention," wfas the impatient reply of&#xD;
Coma.&#xD;
" Notwithstanding your indignant denial of the guilt of this&#xD;
fellow Head," remarked Montlack, looking steadily into the&#xD;
face of his cousin, "I am fully able to prove him a felon, and&#xD;
hold his ,fate in my hands. Even your infatuation cannot&#xD;
blind you to this fact. Your sanguine hopes are all groundless,&#xD;
for his word, or the evidence of his slave, will not be admitted&#xD;
in a court of justice, and my oath, the handwriting of the bond,&#xD;
the witness to it, and the improbability of my borrowing money&#xD;
from him, an almost entire stranger, will all go to pi-ove the&#xD;
forgery and his guilt."&#xD;

" To what does all this tend ?" asked Coma, trembling with&#xD;
agitation.,&#xD;
"-Why, so far I have, from respect for your feelings, neg-&#xD;
lected to treat this felony in the manner it deserves, hoping&#xD;
that the criminal might leave the country, and, once gone, that&#xD;
you would forget that such a being, so unworthy of your esteem&#xD;
or notice, had ever been in existence; but since it has riot so&#xD;
happened, I have but one course left me. You must either&#xD;
pledge me your word and honor that you will never meet or'&#xD;
correspond with him again, or I will take measures immediately&#xD;
-for longer delay would compromise me in the estimation of the&#xD;
community-to secure him as acriminal, and see that he receive&#xD;
the punishment merited by his crimes. You have now my de-&#xD;
termination, and I swear that I will execute it, for it is not a&#xD;
silly threat; so weigh well your answer, for upon it depends&#xD;
the future fate of this unworthy man."&#xD;
Coma was fully aware of the danger hanging over the he'ad&#xD;
of her lover, and trembled with the excess 'of her agitation as&#xD;
she listened to the cool villany of her unworthy suitor; but&#xD;
remembering ,her own recent promises to Bryan, never to doubt&#xD;
again, and his noble determination to meet boldly the ground-&#xD;
less charge made against him, she did not hesitate long, but,&#xD;
rising from her seat, said firmly-.&#xD;
"Your false tongue can never again lower him in my esti-&#xD;
mation; he is innocent, and fears not your malice. As to&#xD;
your threats, I regard them not !-and to your request, un-&#xD;
hesitatingly say nay ! I will now join my father."&#xD;
"And I bear you company," said Montlack, with a smile&#xD;
of devilish meaning, adding, in a lower tone to himself, "for&#xD;
your father must know all this, and shall aid me in netting the&#xD;
bold rascal!"     ,&#xD;
Aroused by the approaching tread of Montlack and his&#xD;
daughter, the general turned quickly in his chair, exclaiming-&#xD;
"'Have you tired of each other's company, children, and&#xD;
come to join me in looking out upon this beautiful moonlight&#xD;
scene? I have been dreaming of the past and future, and have&#xD;

enjoyed myself passing well, though communing with myself,&#xD;

Coma sat down by the side of her father, but made no&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
Montlack, with a glance at his cousin, as if to give her a&#xD;
last chance of agreeing to his request, but which met with&#xD;
no answering look, with an air of deep sorrow replied to his&#xD;
uncle's exclamation-&#xD;
" The conversation of Coma and myself has been anything&#xD;
but .a pleasant one; and I am truly sorry to add to your bitter&#xD;
thoughts by saying that I have been struggling in vain to&#xD;
convince my cousin of the unworthiness of this Mr. Head,&#xD;
with whom she is so much infatuated, and have in return for&#xD;
my kindness only received unmerited abuse, and the informa-&#xD;
tion that she had met him to-day, and that he was innocent&#xD;
both of being the son of a traitor, and of forgery; and in spite&#xD;
of all my entreaties to the contrary, and all the evidence I&#xD;
have brought forward to prove his guilt, so much has she&#xD;
fallen under his blighting influence that she still regards him&#xD;
with favor,,and says she will meet him again. This is truly.&#xD;
distressing, general; and I know of no way to destroy his in-&#xD;
fluence, and get clear of the presumptuous fellow, 1ut to seize&#xD;
him at once for the forgery he has committed, and send him&#xD;
to keep company with his equals in a prison. I had hoped&#xD;
to persuade Coma to see him no more, and treat him with the&#xD;
contempt he deserves; but failing in my endeavors, I have&#xD;
concluded that it was my duty, although a painful one, first to&#xD;
let you know all, and then take immediate steps to have this&#xD;
fellow arrested and punished. In so doing, I trust that I have&#xD;
not presumed too far, and that my relationship, and the lively&#xD;
interest I feel for the happiness of my cousin, and in the fair&#xD;
name of our house, will excuse this seeming interference in so&#xD;
delicate a matter."&#xD;
The general, although greatly astounded and enraged at the&#xD;
information so abruptly given him by Montlack,. managed to&#xD;
smother his anger sufficiently to hear him to the end; but&#xD;

when the cunning captain had concluded his plausible story,&#xD;
exclaimed--&#xD;
" I not only pardon you, Jean, but thank you-and thank&#xD;
you warmly-for the honest zeal you have shown in protecting&#xD;
the fair name of our house. But you, Coma, what shall I say&#xD;
to you ?" he added, turning with flashing eye upon his shrink-&#xD;
ing daughter; " and is it possible that you, the child of a&#xD;
De Lacy, have degraded yourself so much as to again hold&#xD;
communion with this miserable wretch ?"&#xD;
"He is not -miserable, father, on account of any crime,"&#xD;
murmured Coma, bravely determining, now the storm had&#xD;
come, to meet it with a bold heart, " for he is innocent, as he&#xD;
will prove to you, if you will only permit him; but he is&#xD;
miserable, father, because he has been slandered and judged,&#xD;
unjustly, and has not an opportunity of proving his innocence."&#xD;
Wishing to destroy all the influence of Coma, and strengthen,&#xD;
if possible, the prejudice of his uncle, Montlack, in a half&#xD;
mocking, half serious tone, as if amused at the ridiculousness&#xD;
of the charge, and at the same time somewhat hurt, hurriedly&#xD;
remarked--,&#xD;
" Ay! I had forgotten to inform  you, general, that this&#xD;
very cunning Mr. Head has already proved his innocence- to&#xD;
the entire satisfaction of my cousin, and'has done it by his own&#xD;
veracious statement, confirmed by the testimony of a negro;&#xD;
and what is still more amusing, though ,I must confess some-&#xD;
what galling to my self-esteem, has convinced her that I am a&#xD;
great scoundrel, and was engaged in a conspiracy with the rene-&#xD;
gade Girty to strip him of his money, and then ruin his cha.&#xD;
racerr! I expect he had about as much of the one as the other&#xD;
to lose, and it wouldn't bankrupt the nation to purchase out his&#xD;
stock in trade. Had it been anybody else but my cousin, I&#xD;
would have resented this silly and odious charge in a manner,&#xD;
it deserved; but ascribing it not so much to her ill-will for&#xD;
myself as strange -infatuation for this man, I have thought&#xD;
best to consider it the mere idle offspring of a diseased heart.&#xD;

"Shame, shame, Coma !" said her father, angrily; adding,&#xD;
in a more sorrowful tone, "Is it true that my daughter has&#xD;
sunk so low as still to retain a sentiment of affection for one so&#xD;
totally unworthy, and to allow that feeling, with silly infatua-&#xD;
tion, to destroy and wipe out from her heart all respect for her&#xD;
father, and all remembrance of past kindness'and- friendship on&#xD;
the part of her cousin ?  Shame on you, Coma! If any other&#xD;
than Jean had told me this, old as I am, I would have driven&#xD;
the shameful slander down his dishonored throat, and laughed&#xD;
him to scorn!"&#xD;
" He hears but half that hears one party only," said Coma,&#xD;
sadly.&#xD;
" She would have us, general," remarked Montlack, "listen&#xD;
to the denial of the criminal himself, or, forsooth, take the tes-&#xD;
timony of his tutored and trembling slave ! A brave way, this,&#xD;
to get at the truth."&#xD;
"Is it so, Coma ?" asked her father.&#xD;
"It is," replied the daughter, firmly; " for Mr. Head, him-&#xD;
self, is noble, and brave, and truthful; and the black, though&#xD;
belonging to a despised race, has, ever been noted for his&#xD;
honesty and veracity."&#xD;
" This is folly, Coma !-.the very extreme !of folly," said the&#xD;
general; "and do you for a moment suppose that I would take&#xD;
the word of a criminal, and of his slave, against the statement&#xD;
of an honorable man, and that man my own blood relation ?"&#xD;
Montlack turned a triumphant look upon Coma; but she,&#xD;
undaunted, returned it with a flash- of contempt, and, nerving&#xD;
herself for another and last struggle, exclaimed, in reply to her&#xD;
father--&#xD;
"But this is not all, for he will prove to you, by the testi-&#xD;
mony of Captain Kenton, thatMonsieur Montlack was in com-&#xD;

also prove, by the testimony of Sergeant Duffe and others, that&#xD;
his father stood as fair and unsuspected after this slander of&#xD;
his being a spy had been whispered against him as any officer&#xD;
in the army ; and he will go still further, and prove that nny&#xD;
brave cousin here cowardly refused him the satisfaction given&#xD;
by every gentleman for insults offered, and not only refused&#xD;
to meet him, but to meet the Sergeant, even after the latter&#xD;
had disgraced him with a blow; and yet more than that, he will&#xD;

attempted his murder, and when he had failed in his bloody&#xD;
attempt excused himself under the pitiful plea of accident.&#xD;
All this, 'and more, will be prove, if you will only give him an&#xD;
opportunity ; and I pray you, father, for the sake of your&#xD;
daughter, and of justice, that you will do so, and be no longer&#xD;
influenced by the false, but plausible stories of your base and&#xD;
treacherous nephew."&#xD;
Captain Jean had determined in his own mind to show no&#xD;
astonishment at anything Coma might say, but to meet all&#xD;
her charges against himself with indifference,.or with the air&#xD;
of an injured man; and no doubt he would have done so, for&#xD;
he had perfect control over his own emotions and features, had&#xD;
he but had an inkling of what she knew, and of what she&#xD;
was about to say; but, as he had not, in spite of all his en-&#xD;
deavors, he could not entirely conceal his uneasiness, and as&#xD;
Coma spoke, exhibited marked symptoms both of fear and&#xD;
guilt, sufficiently so to convince her of the truth of what she,&#xD;
had heard, and to raise some doubt even in the rind of the&#xD;
general.a&#xD;
" Can this be true, Jean ?" inquired the father, turning his&#xD;
stern eye full upon the face of the abashed captain.&#xD;
"Ha! ha !" laughed Montlack, recovering himself, and&#xD;
attempting to conceal his fears under the appearance of merri--&#xD;
ment-" and- has my wise uncle caught the madness and infa-&#xD;
tuation of his daughter, that he asks, if it was not so supreme-&#xD;

ly silly, such an insulting question?  Why, my dear sir," he&#xD;
continued, noticing his uncle look uneasy under the fear of&#xD;
ridicule, " do not these wonderful stories bear falsehood plainly&#xD;
written upon them, and staring forth at every turn?  I must&#xD;
confess that I was greatly astonished to see the folly even of&#xD;
Coma make her so credulous; but to hear you ask whether&#xD;
these charges were true or false has increased my -surprise&#xD;
tenfold."&#xD;
"Pardon, me, Jean," said De Lacy, reddening under the&#xD;
ridicule of Montlack; "if I had thought a moment, I would&#xD;
have never asked so silly a question. I see my folly now, and&#xD;
the ridiculousness of'-these wild stories."&#xD;
"I acknowledge," continued Montlack, "that Sergeant Duffe&#xD;
called upon me in behalf of this young fellow, and that I re-&#xD;
fused to give him the satisfaction he demanded, simply because&#xD;
he was not my equal, and was the son of a traitor, and himself&#xD;
a felon."&#xD;
"And very properly," remarked the general.&#xD;
"As to Duffe striking me, and I refusing to resent the blow,&#xD;
that story is but on a par with the others," continued Mont-&#xD;
lack, "and without one atom of foundation; for the Sergeant,&#xD;
who is a man of honor, seeing at once that my reasons for de-&#xD;
clining a meeting with his principal were valid and good,&#xD;
quietly took his leave, and, if I am not mistaken, was met by&#xD;
you, general, upon the stairway, exhibiting in .his appearance,&#xD;
I suppose, no mark either of anger or violence."&#xD;
"None at all; -I never saw him more polite," replied the&#xD;
general.&#xD;
"As for this Mr. Renton," said Montlack, "that my de-&#xD;
ranged little cousin mentions so frequently, I know nothing&#xD;
of him more than he fled the country some years ago for mur-&#xD;
der, and since that time has been a wild and reckless outlaw&#xD;
upon our western frontier.,, If he can be found, I have no&#xD;
doubt he will swear to all Coma has said, and even more, if&#xD;
this cunning Mr, Head will make the consideration sufficiently&#xD;
large. Why," added the captain, "I would want no better&#xD;

evidence of the guilt of this man than the witnesses he intro-&#xD;
duces to prove his innocence. First of all comes himself, the&#xD;
son, as you well know, of a traitor and spy; then a negro, his&#xD;
own slave; then a reckless murderer and outlaw; and who&#xD;
next, unless it be the veritable Girty himself, I am at a loss to&#xD;
say. Bah! Coma, don't you see how ridiculous these - stories.&#xD;
are?  What inducement had I to tmcrime and treachery you&#xD;
have charged against me?  Was I not his strong and fast&#xD;
friend ?, and did I not plead his cause with ybur father until I&#xD;
found him unworthy of your love? And why should I go to&#xD;
him, a stranger, for money, when my uncle has never refused&#xD;
ne any sum I have asked ?"&#xD;
"True," muttered the general.&#xD;
"Besides," continued Montlack, "we have every reason to&#xD;
believe that -this fellow never had such a sum; for none of&#xD;
these worthy witnesses- of his, not even his foster-father, the&#xD;
Sergeant, has ever mentioned his having any money.-I&#xD;
"I can prove that!" exclaimed Coma, her face brightening,&#xD;
"for he told me so, and before the date of that bond."&#xD;
"Ha, ha!" laughed Montlack, " and here is his other wit-&#xD;
ness. You will be highly honored, uncle, when your daughter&#xD;
shall be brought into a court, along with' a negro, renegade, and&#xD;
outlaw, to prove the character of her lover, the forger."&#xD;
De Lacy became livid with rage at the very thought of such&#xD;
a disgrace, and,.in reply to the captain's galling picture of his&#xD;
daughter's appearance in court as a witness for Bryan, ex-&#xD;
claimed, in furious rage--&#xD;
"Begone, Coma! and let me hear no more of this low&#xD;
scoundrel. I would sooner see you in your grave than under-&#xD;
going the stare of a grinning crowd in a court of justice."&#xD;
"'But, father," said Coma, "you would not have an inno-&#xD;
cent man convicted of a crime, and disgraced forever, when my&#xD;
evidence might be of advantage, and perhaps saveohim ?"&#xD;
"Innocent!" shouted the general, giving way to his fury.&#xD;
" Why he is as black, and base, and guilty as hell itself, and&#xD;
none but a maudlin love-sick fool could think otherwise. .I&#xD;

" To-morrow, I will see that he be placed in the hands of&#xD;
justice," replied Montlack, glancing at Coma, "and then he&#xD;
will have an opportunity, as he so much desiresit, of proving&#xD;
all the fine stories he habeen telling my very credulous cou-&#xD;
sin. Depend'upon me, it will not be my fault, sir, if I do not&#xD;

weeping, "and you have been deceived by Jean. You will&#xD;
find out at last that this cousi of mine, who is nothing more&#xD;
than a base, plotting hypocrite has been using you as a tool to&#xD;
cover up his own wickedness and treachery, and insure success&#xD;
to his villanous schemes."&#xD;
Poor Coma_!, she was veiy unfortunate in using the expres.&#xD;
sion "tool;" for, although nothing is more common than for&#xD;
one man to be made a tool of by another, still there is no ex-&#xD;
pression in the English language. so loathed and hated as this.&#xD;
And so it was now with the general, and he shouted with fury-&#xD;
" A tool! Things are coming to a pretty pass indeed when a&#xD;
silly girl has hardihood enough to brand her father with the&#xD;
odious title of tool. Begone, shameless girl, to your room, and&#xD;
consider yourself a prisoner until you have my permission to&#xD;

obey his harsh command, "that if you ever meet or correspond&#xD;
with this man again,, I will disown you, and drive you forth a&#xD;
beggar, never more to return. Go, now; you'have my com-&#xD;

&#xD;
CHAPTER        XII.&#xD;
"NOTHIN' more sartain," repliedaJenton, in answer to an&#xD;
inquiry of Bryan respecting Simon Girty; "he's worse than an&#xD;
Ingen; and I'm as sartain this wer' him as my name's Simon&#xD;
Kenton. I've trailed him and his murdering' redskins many&#xD;
a day through the woods of Kaintuck, and would have known&#xD;
him at first sight out thar, notwithstandin' his red wig and&#xD;
ragged dress; but cuss me if, I 'spected him here in the old&#xD;
settlements, and he fooled me, sure enough."&#xD;
" You will have your revenge some of these days," said&#xD;
Bryan, consolingly.&#xD;
"As for that, Mr. Bryan, I guess J'm already even with&#xD;
him; for I fooled hi= once," chuckled the borderer, " to the&#xD;
loss of 'bout thirty of his yellin' devils."'&#xD;
"How was that?" asked the Sergeant.&#xD;
"Why, you must know, Sargeant, I wer' at the time I'm&#xD;
speakin' of in one of them stockade forts, out in Kaintuck,&#xD;
called Bryant's Station, and had been thar for a considerable&#xD;
spell, as hunter and spy for the settlement, when one mornin',&#xD;
jist as we wer'. all gittin' ready to leave the fort for a grand&#xD;
hunt, we wer' suddenly pretty considerably dumfoundered by&#xD;
the 'pearance of a band of Ingens, yellin' like devils, and pep-&#xD;
perin' away at us, from the east side of the station. At first&#xD;
the youngsters, 'for we had 'bout forty men in the fort, began&#xD;
to grow sorter pale, but after a short spell, findin' they wer'n't&#xD;
all dead, and that the- redskins only numbered 'bout thirty,&#xD;
they wer' for rushin' out at once and takin' it rough and tum-&#xD;
ble with the inimy. But I know'd it wer' agin the natur' of&#xD;
an Ingen to risk anything, and weren't going' to be fooled by&#xD;
the 'tarnal rascals in that ar' way, and told the boys that wer'&#xD;
jist what the red devils wer' after; and, in my opinion, they&#xD;

had ai ambuscade on the west side 'round the spring-which&#xD;
wer' about two hundred yards outside the picket fence-and&#xD;
they wer' only waitin' for us to sally out by the east gate, to&#xD;
make a rush on the west side, and carry it when none of us&#xD;
wer' thar to make any show of a fight. The capting, who&#xD;
know'd all about Ingen Ways, wer' jist of my notion, and the&#xD;
boys, too, when they had hearn me out; and so we all fell to&#xD;
thinkin' how we'd turn the tables on the blasted critters.&#xD;
First of all, the captain said, we must git a supply of water&#xD;
from the spring, for if the Ingens wer' in force, which wer'&#xD;
pretty sartain to all on us, then they would lie around the&#xD;
station for days,. and we'd all die for the want of somethin' to&#xD;
drink. But how to git it wer' the question, and a darned&#xD;
tough one, too, and troubled us 'mazingly; for we wer' jist as&#xD;
sartain the Ingens wer' in ambush round the spring as if we&#xD;
had seed 'em. At last, when we couldn't do anything else,&#xD;
we all come to the conclusion-though itedid go a little agin&#xD;
the grain-that it wer' best for the women-folks jist to take&#xD;
thar pails and go to the spring as usual, as if nothin' wer'&#xD;
'spected."&#xD;
"And more shame to you !" exclaimed Mrs. Duffe, bridling&#xD;
up, "to send the women where you were afraid to go yourselves !"&#xD;
"We wer'n't 'zactly 'shamed," replied the borderer, with a&#xD;
roguish wink, "but felt sorter ticklish-like. We know'd they&#xD;
wouldn't be in much danger, and-wer'n't afeared of the Ingens&#xD;
doin' them any harm, for we knew, if they wer' in ambuscade,&#xD;
as we 'spected, they wouldn't show themselves for a few wo-&#xD;
men scalps, when, by lyin' still, they might surprise the fort,.&#xD;
and scalp the whole on us."&#xD;
"And did they go?" asked the Sergeant's wife, becoming&#xD;
impatient.&#xD;
"Sarta inly," replied Kenton ; "but it took a~ pretty con-&#xD;
siderable quantity of coaxin', I can tell you, as much so as to&#xD;
make one of 'em marry a fellow. lHowsomever, at last, when&#xD;
we had pretty nigh gin up the idea, they all 'greed to make&#xD;
the trial, and the capting's wife takin' the lead, the rest all&#xD;

follered her. When they wer' all once well outer the fort,&#xD;
blast me if we didn't begin to repent, and feel like chargin'&#xD;
out on the red rascals; but thar wer' no help for it then; so&#xD;
we jist kept a -close watch, holdin' on .to the gate, and if one&#xD;
Ingen had showed his head, cuss me if we wouldn't have been&#xD;
down on 'em, if they had been a thousand to one. But they.&#xD;
didn't make any noise, and, jist as we 'spected, kept low, with-&#xD;
out diskiverin' themselves; and the women went on slowly to&#xD;
the spring, and by turns filled their pails and returned to the&#xD;
fort, all in due order, till they got safe back to the gate, when&#xD;
they begun to crowd some; but we didn't say anything, and&#xD;
made no complaint, though they did spill a sight of the water.&#xD;
It wer' a ticklish manouvre that, Sargeant, but 'twas the best&#xD;
we could do, and our only chance, and I reckon we didn't&#xD;
breathe more nor once from the time the women left the gate&#xD;
till they all got back again "&#xD;
"What did you do, then ?" asked Duffe.&#xD;
"0, we felt safe enough !" laughed Kenton. "Once we&#xD;
had the water inside of the fort, we didn't care a dratted bit for&#xD;
all the Ingens in creation. We know'd the most of them wer'&#xD;
down around the spring, so we jist sent out ten of the most&#xD;
active of the boys to brush with them fellers on the east side,&#xD;
and the balance of us got ready on the west side, to wait thar&#xD;
main attack. Sure enough," continued the Scout, warming&#xD;
up with the recollection of the fight, "so soon as the boys&#xD;
commenced pepperin' away at them ar' devils on the east side,&#xD;
and the Ingens gradually retreated 'cordin' to thar plan, and&#xD;
the boys follered slowly, 'cordin' to our'n, up jumps that ar'&#xD;
same Simon Girty, with more than five hundred of his red-&#xD;
skins, and made straight for the west gate. But we wer' all&#xD;
thar waitin'; and when they had got in good shootin' distance,&#xD;
may-be we didn't let 'em have it !-and blast me if we didn't&#xD;
jist cover the ground with thar painted bodies, and in a minute&#xD;
not one of them wer' to be seen! They got back to cover a&#xD;
little faster than they got outer it, cussin' and howlin' at how&#xD;
they wer' took in; and at the same time our boys came runnin'&#xD;

in at the east gate, laughin' and shoutin' at how we had fooled&#xD;
the tarnation critters."&#xD;
"Pretty well done !" exclaimed Duffe, with a soldier's.admi-&#xD;
ration of a well-played stratagem; "you outtricked Girty that&#xD;
time very handsomely !"&#xD;
"I guess he wer' proper mad at his defeat!" laughed Ken-&#xD;
ton, "for I hearn him cussin' away like all wrath, and jist&#xD;
called out to him, in a good-humored way, to try it agin; but&#xD;
he only cussed the louder, and swore he'd have our scalps be-&#xD;
fore he wer' done with us."&#xD;
"And did he get them ?" asked Sally, with great simplicity.&#xD;
"Not 'zactly," said the Scout, rubbing the top of his head,&#xD;
and glancing with his laughing blue eye at the earnest face of&#xD;
the questioner, "for we wer'n't perlite enough to go out and&#xD;
give 'em to him, and he wer'n't able to get in and take 'em--&#xD;
and so we jist 'mused ourselves for a day or so shootin' at each&#xD;
other, and when he found nothin' wer' to be made at that&#xD;
ar' game, he quietly broke up the siege and left. We didn't&#xD;
insist on his stayin' any longer, and wer'n't uncommon sorry&#xD;
when he left; for, to tell the truth, our water began to run&#xD;
very low, and with it went our fine spirits, and one and all we&#xD;
wer' gittin' pretty considerably tired of constant watchin' and&#xD;
fightin'."&#xD;
"A very fair brush," muttered the Sergeant. "But did&#xD;
you permit him and his savages to leave the country without&#xD;
interruption ?"&#xD;
" A cuss on it-no!" shouted Kenton, his eye gleaming&#xD;
with fury, and his half jocular tone giving place to one of deep&#xD;
passion. " But it wer' a sad day for us that we didn't."&#xD;
" How so ?" inquired the Sergeant.&#xD;
"The cunning villain went away, leavin' a broad trail be-&#xD;
hind him, as if to invite pursuit," said Kenton; "and we, hav&#xD;
in' received a reinforcement, makin' our number some two&#xD;
hundred men, wer' fools enough to fall into the snare-and fol-&#xD;
lerin' on, like blind dogs on a fresh trail, stumbled into an&#xD;
ambuscade, wer' defeated, and lost half our number. Blast&#xD;
him! he wer' more than even with us at the Blue Licks."&#xD;

&#xD;
"Gorror-'mighty ! what's dat ?" shouted Titus, springing to&#xD;
his feet, as a little packet thrown through a broken window-&#xD;
pane fell lightly upon his woolly pate.&#xD;
"After him, Bang!" exclaimed Kenton, springing to the&#xD;
door, rifle in halid.&#xD;
"Stop, Simon, for Heaven's sake !" shouted Bryan, who,&#xD;
seizing the packet, had recognized the address; " whoever it&#xD;
is, he is a friend---let him go."&#xD;
"Jist as you please, Mr. Bryan," replied the Scout, calling&#xD;
off Bang, and turning back.  "I thought, may-be, it might be&#xD;
my old friend Girty agin, and wouldn't have been darnation&#xD;
sorry if it wer', for I'd like most cussedly to take a blaze at him&#xD;
jist now. Blast me, if it wouldn't be some satisfaction to lift&#xD;
his scalp, after thinkin' 'bout that ar' bloody defeat of our'n !"&#xD;
By the ruddy light of the blazing pine fire, Bryan quickly&#xD;
deciphered the hurried note of Coma-for the packet received.&#xD;
so mysteriously was from her-and through it he was informed&#xD;
of all that had taken place at the mansion, of the rage of her&#xD;
father, the continued treachery of the captain, and of the final&#xD;
determination of the latter t  have him arrested. She also&#xD;
made known that she herself was a prisoner, but if, upon the&#xD;
approaching trial, it would be of benefit to show that he had&#xD;
told any one of his being in possession of money, then to have&#xD;
her brought before the court, and not to hesitate a moment on&#xD;
account-of her sex or diffidence; for it was a duty he owed&#xD;
both to himself and her to make the very best defence in his&#xD;
power, and she would never forgive him if he neglected any&#xD;
means of proving his own innocence through a mistaken re-&#xD;
gard for her feelings."       -   .&#xD;
"Generous girl,!" muttered Bryan, dropping his head upon&#xD;
his hand, "I fear that my love will only bring heavy sorrow&#xD;
to thee, and disgrace and disappointment to myself."&#xD;
"None but the brave deserve the fair," said Duffe, with&#xD;
kindly interest, wishing to arouse his desponding foster-child.&#xD;
" True !" exclaimed Bryan, his gloom giving way a little,&#xD;
and speaking now in a firmer and .more cheerful tone; "we&#xD;

"Blast the yaller rascal!" chimed in Kenton. "Is he at his&#xD;
tricks agin ?"&#xD;
" Coma informs me," replied Bryan, divining the wish of his&#xD;
companions, thatt the captain has -completely deceived her&#xD;
father, caused her to be confined to her room as a prisoner,&#xD;
and intends to-morrow to have me arrested on the charge of&#xD;
forgery."&#xD;
"Ugh! what a tarnation scoundrel!-why, he could deceive&#xD;
the devil himself with his blasted smiles and soft lying tongue !&#xD;
But come, Mr. Bryan," said the frontiersman, with his accus-&#xD;
tomed promptness, "let's go at once, and set the gal free; tie&#xD;
up the old gineral if he makes a rumpus; and give this 'ere&#xD;
blasted Frenchman, as he won't fight, and has got nigger blood&#xD;
in him anyhow, 'bout five hundred lashes to 'member us by !"&#xD;
."And what would we do then?" said Duffe, wishing to con-&#xD;
vince the rough but honest hunter of the folly of such a course.&#xD;
"Do?" replied Kenton, somewhat at a loss for an answer-&#xD;
" why, jist do what we please, and leave this 'ere cussed coun-&#xD;
try, with its laws, and gammon, and trumpery, and sich like,&#xD;
and make our way to Kaintuck, whar' the only court-house is&#xD;
the broad heavens-the only law, the heart-the only defence&#xD;
against sich villains as these, a strong arm and a brave soul-&#xD;
and the only punishment, the bullet and tomahawk! Them's&#xD;
my laws; and what's the use, jist tell me, of courts, and law-&#xD;
yers, and judges, when they all work for money, and for the&#xD;
rich agin the poor, and won't break one of them ar' confounded&#xD;
rules of thar's, not even to save an honest man, and punish a&#xD;
black-hearted traitor ?-whar's the sense, I say, in lettin' a yal-&#xD;

OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
geons they've got, and you'll never see the blessed daylight&#xD;
agin. It's no use, I tell you, to try to make yourself out inno-&#xD;
cent in them ar' courts; for that's not thar business, and they'll&#xD;
jist make you out as black as. the very devil himself, in spite&#xD;
of all on us ! No! no !-take my advice; let's go and free&#xD;
Miss Coma, thrash the Frenchman, and then make a bold push&#xD;
for the ' Cane Land,' leavin' a dark trails behind us!  Them's&#xD;
my sentiments."&#xD;
" Your plan will not do, Simon," replied Bryan, shaking his&#xD;
head at this earnest appeal of the Scout, "for my name and,4&#xD;
character are at stake, and I must remain and defend them,&#xD;
though, as you say, the chances are against me, and more than&#xD;
probable I will be consigned to a dungeon."&#xD;
'l When we're hemmed in by Ingens," said the Scout, sen-&#xD;
tentiously, "and can't run, then we jist make up our minds,&#xD;
as die we must, to fight it out, and take the chances!--but&#xD;
when thar's no hope for victory, and the path ar' still open,&#xD;
we don't, like plaguy fools, jist hand over our scalps to the&#xD;
blasted redskins, but turn our backs at once, and make tracks,&#xD;
hopin' for better success at some other time."&#xD;
"But matters are not so desperate with me as you imagine,"&#xD;
said Bryan, "fortI am, as you know, innocent of any crime,&#xD;
and have strong hopes of making it so appear to the court,&#xD;
and of confounding the cunningcaptain."&#xD;
'Thar's jist about as much hope of your proving' your inno-&#xD;
cence," replied the Scout, sullenly, " as I would have, if bound&#xD;
to the stake by the Shawanees, of moving' them to pity ! If you&#xD;
ever git into them ar' courts, and into the hands of them oily-&#xD;
tongued lawyers, if you ain't lost to a sartainty, then my name&#xD;
ain't Simon. Ain't he, Bang ?"&#xD;
Bang growled his assent as plain as a politician when&#xD;
making known his principles, and the Scout, as if fully satisfied&#xD;
with being endorsed by his dog, in whom he had great confi-&#xD;
dence, especially as he always agreed with himself, after a&#xD;
rather triumphant look at Bryan and the Sergeant, resumed&#xD;
his seat, to await in silence their determination.&#xD;

"Bryan is right," remarked Duffe, with a good-natured&#xD;
smile at the excited borderer, "for this is a land of laws, and&#xD;
by the laws must this matter be settled, and to the laws must&#xD;
we all, as good citizens, submit."&#xD;
"A darn'd poor recommendation to encourage immigration&#xD;
into any country," growled Kenton, for he had as great a&#xD;
hatred as terror of the laws; and a judge and court were far&#xD;
more terrible in his eyes than a band of yelling savages.&#xD;
" Don't give up so, Simon," said Bryan, cheeringly, " for&#xD;
the battle is yet to be fought, and they won't find us so-easy&#xD;
to corner, after all."&#xD;
"o ! if you are for fightin'," exclaimed the Scout, his face&#xD;
brightening, "then I'm in. Darnation take me if the Sergeant,&#xD;
and you, and Titus, and myself, not forgettin' Bang, can't lick&#xD;
out the whole 'posse come at us,' with that ar' dratted French-&#xD;
man and the lawyers flung in for good count. Now you are&#xD;
talking' somethin' like, Mr. Bryan, and I hain't got a word to&#xD;
say agin it."&#xD;
"You are entirely mistaken in-my meaning, Simon," replied&#xD;
Bryan, smiling at the borderer's simplicity; "I did not intend&#xD;
that we would fight them in the manner that you suppose, but&#xD;
with the law and in a legal manner&#xD;
" Cuss-the law !" exclaimed Kenton, passionately; "I wish&#xD;
I were whar I'd never hear of it again ! Blast me if I don't&#xD;
feel, all the time you talk so much about it, as if I wer' in one&#xD;
of them darned jails, with 'bout a hundred pounds of iron on&#xD;
my wrists and ankles. I thought you had some sense, Sar-&#xD;
geant, but you hain't got a dratted bit, or you wouldn't be&#xD;
encouraging Mister Bryan in any sich blasted foolishness .&#xD;
"You have been wandering so long upon the frontiers, Si-&#xD;
mon," replied Duffe, good-humoredly, "that you have taken&#xD;
up a very mistaken notion of the law, and of the manner of&#xD;
righting wrongs in older settled and more civilized countries.&#xD;
The courts are not such terrible bugaboos as you think, and dis-&#xD;
pense justice far more frequently than they have the credit of&#xD;
doing ;and are intended to right wrongs, punish the guilty, and&#xD;

protect the innocent ! Don't fear; I am confident Mr. Bryan&#xD;
will have justice done him, or I would be very far from coun-&#xD;
selling his present course !"&#xD;
"Fear !" said Kenton, with a grim smile; "that ain't one&#xD;
of my words !   Drat me if I. fear anything or anybody, if&#xD;
they'll only sing out and give me warnin'! Let them cuss, or&#xD;
yell, or make a fuss, darn me if I care how, so they raise a rum-&#xD;
pus, and I'M thar and no mistake! But them courts ! blame&#xD;
me if they ain't so still and quiet, and all so rigular-like, with&#xD;
them fellers forever writin' away as if life wer' at stake, and&#xD;
them cold-lookin' old chaps sittin' behind them great big books,&#xD;
and sendin' a poor devil off to them darned jails, which ain't&#xD;
fittin'even for an Ingen, and jist doin' it too as if it weren't no-&#xD;
thin', and all rigular and right, and without any fuss or even&#xD;
a loud word ! blast me, when I sees them a doin' everything so&#xD;
still and quiet-like, and smilin' and laughin' all the time as if&#xD;
it weren't nothin' to be lockin' up a feller-mortal away from&#xD;
the blessed light of the sun, if I don't feel kind of chilly all&#xD;
over, and fancy I've got in among the dead, and look round for&#xD;
the graves and ones! It tain't nat'ral;'Sargeant, I tell you&#xD;
taint, for, if a feller ls done wrong, why don't they cuss and&#xD;
make a fuss, and sorter 'rouse him up a little; and not jist be&#xD;
axin' a few civil questions, as if thar wer' nothin' outer the&#xD;
way, and then sendin' him off to jail as good-humoredly as if&#xD;
they wer' tellin' him to go home to his wife and little ones!&#xD;
No ! no! Mr. Bryan, keep clear of them courts, for they hain't&#xD;
got no feelin' for a poor feller, and don't care no more for his&#xD;
prayers and distress, and promises to do better, than I do for a&#xD;
dead Mingo !"'&#xD;
Kenton spoke so earnestly, and described, in his simple way,&#xD;
so accurately and forcibly the noiseless unfeeling minute of a&#xD;
criminal court, that it was not without its influence upon his&#xD;
hearers; and Bryan's pale and agitated countenance told too&#xD;
plainly for concealment the emotion excited in his bosom.&#xD;
"Faith, Simon !" exclaimed Duffe, with a laugh, for he saw&#xD;
the effect of Kenton's chilling description' upon~ Bryan, and&#xD;

wished, if possible, to remove it; "you have a most holy horror&#xD;
of legal proceedings, and, to judge from your earnest and graphic&#xD;
sketch, must have been more than a spectator of one of these&#xD;
scenes !"&#xD;
"I never wer' in a court but once," said Kenton, a shade of&#xD;
sadness flitting across his bronzed and weather-beaten counte-&#xD;
nance, " and I wer' then but a boy; but I've never forgotten&#xD;
the sad sights I then witnessed, and never will; and many a&#xD;
night have I been haunted by the memory of that smilin'-faced&#xD;
and, in my imagination, stony-hearted old judge ! and you know,&#xD;
Sergeant, I've been a fugitive from j ustices myself, thinkin' I&#xD;
wer' guilty of a great crime when I wer' not ! and this kept&#xD;
alive all my horror and terror of the law; and blast me if I've&#xD;
'zactly got over it yet!"&#xD;
Bryan walked restlessly across the floor, for the memories of&#xD;
Kenton were anything but soothing to him in his present per-&#xD;
plexed, and, in spite of all his hopes, dangerous situation. He&#xD;
felt, and acknowledged in his own heart, that, with the influence&#xD;
of Montlack and General De Lacy against him, his chance of&#xD;
having an impartial hearing and strict justice was anything but&#xD;
flattering. At one time he almost caie to the conclusion of&#xD;
taking the.advice of Kenton; but t en came thoughts of Coma,&#xD;
his own declarations of innocence, and the unfavorable impres-&#xD;
sion his flight would leave ; and once more he braced himself&#xD;
for the trial, and determined, in his own mind, notwith-&#xD;
standing. the chances were against him, to quietly wait and&#xD;
bravely meet the insidious attack of his foe.&#xD;
Mrs. Duffe had never felt a mother's love, for she was one&#xD;
of those whom God, in his wise Providence, had seen proper&#xD;
never to bless with offspring. Yet she had not become soured&#xD;
with the world as some people are, because not blessed with&#xD;
young flowerets of her own to watch over and protect, and fill&#xD;
her kiid heart with the warm gushings of a mother's love.&#xD;
She neither sighed nor complained, nor grew sad, as some people&#xD;
do, because she was not thus blessed, for she felt that, although&#xD;
she would be happy, too happy, to clasp to her bosom a bright&#xD;

&#xD;
bonny child, and listen to its low laugh and infantile prattle,&#xD;
still, as God had not seen proper so to bless her, she had no right&#xD;
to murmur ; and it might be best after all, for, if she had been&#xD;
denied some joy, she had alsotbeen spared much care and per-&#xD;
haps sorrow. In truth, her simple trusting heart, although&#xD;
ignorant of poetry and untouched by the wild and thrilling&#xD;
emotions of more refined and sensitive minds, was the seat of&#xD;
some such a thought as that so beautifully described by 2Eschy-&#xD;
lus, where he says--&#xD;
"With joy we see our offspring rise,&#xD;
And'happy who notechildless'dies;&#xD;
But Fortune, when her flowerets blow,&#xD;
Oft bears the bitter fruit of woe."&#xD;
As we have said, Mrs. Duffe had never known a mother's&#xD;
love, but she had experienced a feeling very near akin to it&#xD;
for her foster-child Bryan; and now, as she beheld his agony,&#xD;
her heart yearned to throw her arms around him and assure him&#xD;
of her constant affection. She saw his distress, and knew full&#xD;
well, from the workings of his pale face and contracted brow,&#xD;
the terrible battle going on in his heart, and with a woman's&#xD;
sympathy she would hge brought consolation if she only knew&#xD;
how; but not knowing what to do she had remained silent until&#xD;
she saw him shudder at Kenton's description of the heartless&#xD;
ceremony of a court, then springing to her feet she approached&#xD;
him, kindly laying her hand upon his shoulder, as she said--&#xD;
"Come, Bryan, my boy, it pains me to see you so'distressed!&#xD;
The excitement of this day has been too much for you, and you&#xD;
have suffered enough already without dwelling any longer upon&#xD;
the gloomy ceremonials of the approaching trial! Cheer up!&#xD;
and remember, my boy, that we who love you best know that&#xD;
you are innocent, and will love you all the more for your sor-&#xD;
rows, and, let them do what they may, they can't destroy or.take&#xD;
from you our affection ! Come, now, and lay down, and sleep&#xD;
like one that is guiltless of all crime, and. confident in the pro-&#xD;
tecting power of God ! You will be all the better, and all the&#xD;
more able to meet your foes, after a sound sleep !" .&#xD;

CHAPTER         XIII.&#xD;
MONTLACK, finding that his cousin's confidence in and affec-&#xD;
tion for Bryan had been in no way impaired by his defamation,&#xD;
did not hesitate, now that he was sustained and urged on by his&#xD;
uncle, to execute his ulterior plan.&#xD;
He had a twofold inducement to urge him on in his villany:&#xD;
one to free himself from all fear of personal chastisement, and&#xD;
the other to take away all chance of any future meeting between&#xD;
the lovers.. Either of these inducements would have been suf-&#xD;
ficient to fully excite his malicious passions and confirm him in&#xD;
his treacherous designs; but with them both, he made no delay&#xD;
in loudly publishing the charge of forgery against his rival,&#xD;
and proceeded immediately to have a warrant issued for his&#xD;
arrest.&#xD;
Bryan, although aware of his intention, made no attempt to&#xD;
escape, but, on the contrary, quietly took his way to the village,&#xD;
and there suffered the officer, without any resistance on his part&#xD;
or apparent surprise, to take him into custody and carry him&#xD;
at once before the examining court.&#xD;
&#xD;
147&#xD;
&#xD;
" I feel that you are kight, dear mother-for I will still call&#xD;
you mother, as you are the only mother I have ever known,"&#xD;
said Bryan, a tear of affection welling up in his dark eye-" and&#xD;
like a son will obey your wish now as I have often done when&#xD;
a boy; and may He who governs all things not forget her that&#xD;
has ever had a kindly heart for a motherless boy !"&#xD;
As Bryan leftthe room, the honest Sergeant clasped to his&#xD;
bosom his weeping wife, and the stern, uncouth, unlettered&#xD;
frontiersman, wiping from his glistening eye a falling tear, ex.&#xD;
claimed, with the wildyvehemence of his unrestrained nature-&#xD;
" May Heaven desert me when I desert that boy !"&#xD;

SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
We will follow him into the presence of the two justices, and&#xD;
along with theeager crowd.take a look at these awful function-&#xD;
aries, and hear the result of the trial, of such great importance&#xD;
to our hero, and of so little interest or consequence to his judges&#xD;
or any of the pressing listeners,-with the exception of the Ser-&#xD;
geant and his companions, Kenton and Titus.&#xD;
The justices were rough and unpolished, and almost unlet.-&#xD;
tered men ; having great pride in their office, and eager, judg-&#xD;
ing by their actions, to appear upon intimate terms with the&#xD;
general .and Montlack, who were considered the most wealthy,&#xD;
and therefore, as we have no titles in 'this 'country, the most&#xD;
aristocratic citizens of ,the neighborhood ; and for whom the&#xD;
honest dispensers of the law had, with praiseworthy politeness,&#xD;
made room upon the bench, and with whom they were now en-&#xD;
gaged in earnest conversation.&#xD;
Kenton, armed as if for battle, with rifle, tomahawk, and&#xD;
knife, stood like a gigantic statue, leaning against one of the&#xD;
pillars of the court-room, gazing silently and gloomily upon the&#xD;
crowd; ever and anon turning a flashing eye upon the justices,&#xD;
who were still conversing with Montlack, and breaking forth&#xD;
momentarily in heartless laughter, as if totally ignorant or&#xD;
careless of the grave nature of their present duty. The heart&#xD;
of the simple backwoodsman, as he looked, recoiled with secret&#xD;
terror; and when he witnessed the apparent intimacy of the&#xD;
prosecutor and judges of.Bryan, he lost all hope, and internally&#xD;
cursed the folly of Duffe and Bryan, and blamed himself that&#xD;
he had not been more urgent in pressing flight.&#xD;
And what hope of acquittal or justice had Bryan from the&#xD;
two judges chosen and prejudiced against him by his foe, and&#xD;
upon such intimate terms with his enemy, the impeaching of&#xD;
whose evidence was the only chance of safety?&#xD;
None! and Kenton was right, all the poets and lauders of&#xD;
the law to-the contrary notwithstanding; for what prospect has&#xD;
a poor, unknown, and humble man of obtaining justice, when&#xD;
opposed by the rich and the powerful, and whose word has to -&#xD;
be weighed in the balances against the haughty denial of his&#xD;

wealthy opponent? Rags have ever been considered primafacia&#xD;
evidence of knavery, and poverty of dishonesty; while, on the&#xD;
other hand, the gilding and tinsel of wealth have ever been&#xD;
considered, by the mass at least as 'proof positive of truth and&#xD;
honesty. Let a pocket be picked in a crowd, and the-shabbiest-&#xD;
looking man in the company will be seized upon as the criminal.&#xD;
Let a house be broken open and robbed, and ten to one the&#xD;
poorest man in the neighborhood will be immediately sus-&#xD;
pected. Let two men be walking along a street, the one well&#xD;
dressed, and the other in shabby apparel; and let the former&#xD;
dash a stone in at a window, and he may pass on unsuspected,&#xD;
whilst his companion will be hurried at once to the police-office.&#xD;
It is the same with the world as in courts; and dress, appear-&#xD;
ance, and station have an equal influence in both. A poet of&#xD;
antiquity has most beautifully described what a court should be,&#xD;
but what, I am sorry to say, it very frequently is not: where&#xD;
he says,&#xD;
" But justice bids her ray divine&#xD;
Even on the low-roof'd cottage shine,&#xD;
And beams her glories on the life&#xD;
That knows not fraud or ruffian strife;&#xD;
The gorgeous glare of gold, obtained&#xD;
By foul, polluted hands, disdained&#xD;
She leaves, and with averted eyes&#xD;
To humbler, holier mansions flies;&#xD;
Andlooking through the times to come,&#xD;
Assigns each deed its righteous doom."&#xD;
But we will now return to the trial of our hero.&#xD;
Montlack came down from his seat by the judges, and after&#xD;
whispering his groundless proof of the guilt of the prisoner into&#xD;
the willing ear of the prosecuting attorney, and hinting a dou-&#xD;
ceur in case of success, the latter proceeded without delay to&#xD;
make known the crime of Bryan to the court, and prove it by&#xD;
the artful prosecutor and prejudiced general.&#xD;
Conscious of innocence,.Bryan sat in the prisoner's box, sup-&#xD;
ported by his friend and foster-father, the Sergeant; and so&#xD;

SIMON KENTONj&#xD;
&#xD;
calm and unruffled did he appear, now that he had made up&#xD;
his mind to submit to his fate, and trust his defence to the&#xD;
justice and righteousness of his cause, that the wily captain&#xD;
actually trembled when he looked upon his open, unflinching&#xD;
countenance, fearing (for who is ever confident in a .dishonest&#xD;
act?) that there was something still behind and unknown to&#xD;
him, which might yet destroy his well-concocted plot, and cover&#xD;
himself with richly merited opprobrium and disgrace. But the&#xD;
captain, had he only glanced at the desponding face of the art-&#xD;
less and honest Sergeant, would have been assured at once, and&#xD;
rested easy, if a wicked, plotting, treacherous soul like his could&#xD;
be satisfied with anything less than positive conviction.&#xD;
With the proud consciousness of integrity, Bryan refused to&#xD;
employ any counsel, as he said, either to distort or conceal, and&#xD;
determined, greatly against the wish of the more practical Duffe,&#xD;
to make his own defence, believing, in the simplicity of his&#xD;
heart, that his .own straightforward story, told with the earnest-&#xD;
ness of truth, would be believed by all, and convince the court&#xD;
at once of his innocence.&#xD;
We must acknowledge that this was a very silly determina-&#xD;
tion on the part of our hero; for, being a lawyer ourself, it will&#xD;
not do to encourage any snel contempt of the profession; and&#xD;
we will just here take occasion to advise all persons who get at&#xD;
loggerheads with the law. never to think of getting through&#xD;
without the service of a lawyer; for, although we do sometimes&#xD;
get them into a difficulty, it is equally true that; when they fall&#xD;
into difficulties themselves, we are the only persons who can get&#xD;
them out. It takes a lawyer to meet a lawyer, and no one is&#xD;
so ready to unravel rascality as our profession; for, although&#xD;
the old saying, "set a thief," &amp;amp;c., will not apply to us, still we&#xD;
have so much to do with rascality and rascals that we soon&#xD;
begin to know all their beats, and can stumble upon their&#xD;
lurking-places, when less practised persons, although well&#xD;
skilled in the. world and worldly affairs, would be totally at&#xD;
fault. But we will not wander from the trial, especially when&#xD;
we ai'e fully aware that our episode on lawyers ir useless, and&#xD;

the world already pretty well satisfied of our shrewdness upon&#xD;
all things connected with villany.&#xD;
The prosecuting attorney, having fully proved by the captain&#xD;
that the bond exhibited in court was a forgery, and never given&#xD;
by him to the prisoner; and also by General De Lacy, and&#xD;
several other respectable witnesses, that it was not in the usual&#xD;
handwriting of Montlack, with an exulting smile at the justices&#xD;
(which was acknowledged by a significant nod), and a con-&#xD;
temptuous look at Bryan, rested the case.4&#xD;
Being asked by the court in a rather careless manner, as of&#xD;
course he had not, if he had any defence to make, or any wit-&#xD;
nesses to examine, Bryan arose from his seat, and gave a simple,&#xD;
unvarnished account of all that had taken place between 'him-&#xD;
self and the captain ; and, in conclusion, called upon the Ser-&#xD;
geant to prove his respectability and honesty; and upon Ken-&#xD;
ton, to show his intercourse with Montlack, and the intimacy&#xD;
between the latter and Simon Girty, the witness to the bond.&#xD;
The truthful earnestness of Bryan, and his manly, open face&#xD;
and frankness, made a decided impression in his favor upon&#xD;
the crowd, but none at all upon his judges; for they had heard&#xD;
nothing but what had been explained to them by Montlack;&#xD;
and their unmeaning, stolid countenances wore no ,expression&#xD;
of doubt or sympathy.&#xD;
When the Sergeant, in giving his testimony, had proudly&#xD;
alluded to the goodness .of heart and honesty of the prisoner,&#xD;
and.to tlge patriotism and bloody death of his father, atd, in&#xD;
conclusion, had, with a look and tone of honest indignation and&#xD;
scora, made known the cowardice and hypocrisy of Montlack,&#xD;
 there was a murmur of approbation from the crowd, and for the&#xD;
moment Bryan and even Kenton had a hope. But this tran-&#xD;
sient, flash of sympathy from the fickle mob was as quickly dis-&#xD;
pelled as excited, by the prosecuting attorney asking, in a&#xD;
sneering voice-&#xD;
"The prisoner is a foster-son of yours, I believe, sir; is he&#xD;
not ?"&#xD;

"0! no doubt of that-....-none in the world !" laughed the&#xD;
lawyer; "and I don't wonder at all that you give him such a&#xD;
goo character; my only surprise is that you hadn't made him&#xD;
out a saint at once, while you were at it. You can stand back,&#xD;
sir.d Whenever we haveup any more of your children, we will&#xD;
send for you; for we have no doubt they are all honest fellows,&#xD;
just like this one."&#xD;
Thus, with a light laugh and pointless sally, had the adroit-s&#xD;
attrney destroyed the favorable impression made by Bryan's&#xD;
story, and the Sergeant's straightforward, honest evidence; and&#xD;
once more the crowd, careless and uninterested, relapsed into&#xD;
iirence, while the judges smiled approvingly upon the&#xD;
cunning counsel.p&#xD;
A cloud gathered upon the brow of Duffe, for he saw through&#xD;
the design of the lawyer, and knew that he had succeeded; but,&#xD;
hopeless, he made no reply; and retiring from the witness-stand,&#xD;
again took his seat by the side of Bryan.&#xD;
The dark portals of the dungeon, concealed for a moment by&#xD;
the bright wings of Hope, were again in view-&#xD;
Kenton was next called to the stand; and, as the bordered&#xD;
removed his cap, exposing his broad bronzed forehead, and&#xD;
grasping    his inewy hand his trusty rifle, stood proudly&#xD;
erect, glancing around with fearless eye upon the eager multi-&#xD;
tude., A slight murmur of applause greeted his appearance.&#xD;
But this mark of approbation caused a frown to gather upon&#xD;
he brow of Montlack, which one of the sycophantic justices&#xD;
observing, hurried to remove, by exclaiming, in a harsh, per"mp-&#xD;
ory voice--.&#xD;
"See here, sir witness? do you consider us cutthroats, that&#xD;
you come thus armed into court ?"&#xD;
I don't consider you any better; and if you want my gin..&#xD;
nine opinion, and no concealment, blast me if I don't believe&#xD;
you are a darned sight worse," was the cool reply.&#xD;
"We do not permit such language as thatt" retorted the&#xD;

" May-be you don't, and may-be you do," said Kenton, care-&#xD;
lessly  "but if it are difficulty you want to begettin' into,&#xD;
you've said enough, and I'm your man."&#xD;
The crowd laughed at the borderer's contempt of the court;&#xD;
and the justices, not liking his formidable appearance, and the&#xD;
cool maniier he received their threats, took another tack to gain&#xD;
their point, by ordering him to lay aside his rifle.&#xD;
" It's agin my principles," replied the Scout, "ever to part&#xD;
with old Betsy. She 'companies me by day, and sleeps with&#xD;
me. at night; and I couldn't begin to feel easy without her.&#xD;
Ay, Bang," he added, stooping to pat his, dog-that worthy&#xD;
having, at length, managed to creep through the dense crowd&#xD;
to his feet-" you've got yourself into darned bad company,&#xD;
and many a dog has been killed for bein' in no worse."&#xD;
Another laugh from the crowd greeted this rather equivo-&#xD;
cal speech of Kenton; but the justices being in no way amused&#xD;
at a joke at their expense, one of them exclaimed-&#xD;
" This is insufferable, sir; and if we thought you intentionally&#xD;
impudent in your remarks, would not hesitate to commit you&#xD;
for contempt."&#xD;
«"I wer' talkin' of dogs," replied Kenton, with -a smile of&#xD;
cunning simplicity, "and had no idea your honors would take&#xD;
it as personal."&#xD;
Another burst of merriment greeted this sally, and the law-&#xD;
yer, wishing to curry favor with the court, by coming to their'&#xD;
rescue, remarked in a cool, sneering tone-&#xD;
"We have had quite enough of your would-be 'wit, sir, and&#xD;
want you now to tell all you know; and it may be well enough&#xD;
to add, before we go further, that we expect you to tell the&#xD;
truth."&#xD;
a1 reckon you've the advantage of me thar, Mr. Lawyer,&#xD;

the cool rejoinder of the Scout.&#xD;

"Tatk dog of yours must be the devil, or the devil's repre-&#xD;

am totaciously used up. Dis nigger speck he let Massa Simon&#xD;
'lone, next time."&#xD;
Finding the lawyer not disposed to make any further remark,&#xD;
Kenton continued his evidence,' winding up by saying "that&#xD;
Montlack and Girty signed the bond in the old haunted cabin,&#xD;
and received the money from Bryan."&#xD;
"How do you know that Captain Montlack signed this&#xD;
bond ?" said the lawyer, sharply, after counselling a moment&#xD;
with the prosecutor, and holding the paper up to Kenton; "did&#xD;
you see him do it?  Remember! I ask you, did you see him,&#xD;
with your own eyes, either sign this paper. or receive the&#xD;
money ?"&#xD;
"Not 'zactly with my own eyes," said Simon, with great&#xD;
simplicity, "for I wer'n't thar, but Titus wer', and saw him,&#xD;
and he's as white as that yaller rascal, and told me so; and&#xD;
blame me if I don't swar to it!"&#xD;
" 0! I have no doubt of that!" sneered the lawyer, "or to&#xD;
anything else this negro or the prisoner would tell you. You&#xD;
can stand back, sir, for we don't wish to cross-examine a man&#xD;
so reckless of the truth as you are."&#xD;
"A joke are a joke, mister," replied Simon, his eye burn-&#xD;
ing with gathering fury, "but by the Etarnal, if you pretend&#xD;
to charge me with falsehood, if I don't cut out your lying tongue&#xD;
right here, in spite of the court and all this 'ere crowd, or my&#xD;

"Go it, old bruiser !" shouted some one of the crowd;&#xD;
" cuss me if we don't see you fair play and a free fight !"&#xD;
"Silence in court !" shouted one of the justices; "we'll fine&#xD;
and imprison the first man that creates a disturbance."&#xD;
The lawyer saw that he had gone.too far, and trembled for&#xD;
his life when he beheld the frontiersman significantly place&#xD;
his hand upon the handle of his knife; but having mind enough&#xD;
left to know that discretion was the better part of valor, espe-&#xD;
cially in a case like the present, he quickly exclaimed-&#xD;
"It was merely a joke, sir; I only wished to pay you up for&#xD;
some of the hard licks you have given me..&#xD;

SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
"If that's all," said Simon, falling back to his place, "Im&#xD;
done, and hain't got nothin';more to say. But darn me, Mr.&#xD;
Lawyer, if it didn't look to me surprisin'ly like you meant jist&#xD;
what you said; though I've always hearn it remarked, you&#xD;
lawyers never mean what you say."&#xD;
The evidence concluded, the prosecuting attorney, as is usual&#xD;
with lawyers, made a very few remarks, scarcely unfolding in&#xD;
his. opening address a single point that'he intended to press in&#xD;
his last speech, merely expressing in general terms his confi-&#xD;
d nce of the guilt of the prisoner; and pointing out the strength&#xD;
of the testimony against him, and quietly taking his seat, left&#xD;
Bryan to make the best defence in his power, without any par-&#xD;
ticular argument or point of evidence to combat or rebut!&#xD;
Well aware of his critical situation, and gifted with a shrewd&#xD;
and quick mind, well cultivated, and not altogether ignorant of&#xD;
the law, Bryan proceeded to make his defence. For more than&#xD;
an hour he poured forth his rapid and teeming thoughts with&#xD;
impassioned eloquence and energy; convincing, if not the court,&#xD;
at least the audience of his innocence. And the lucid manner&#xD;
in which he exposed- the treachery of Montlack was not with-&#xD;
out its effect even upon the prejudiced mind of De Lacy, who&#xD;
began to look uneasily, if not suspiciously upon the ever-smiling&#xD;
face of his nephew, and a doubt sprang up within his heart:&#xD;
But the trial was not yet over. The attorney for the com-&#xD;
monwealth, by the rules of the court, had the right to reply,&#xD;
and when Bryan had taken his seat, lost no time in availing&#xD;
himself of this right. With a ,regret that one so gifted as the&#xD;
prisoner had shown himself to be was so criminal, he launched&#xD;
forth with his invective.-treated the statements of Bryan with&#xD;
ridicule-scoffed at the evidence of Duffe and Kenton-laughed.&#xD;
at the idea of the prisoner having money to loan, and of the&#xD;
wealthy captain becoming a' borrower from a stranger, when he&#xD;
had an uncle ever ready to supply his demands-scorned and&#xD;
treated with contempt the idea of impeaching the testimony of&#xD;
Montlack and De Lacy with the evidence of such a man as&#xD;
Kenton, founded upon' the story of a negro, and 'that negro&#xD;

the slave of the prisoner-taunted him with being the son of&#xD;
a traitor and spy, and the companion of the renegade Girty-&#xD;
sneered, with hellish glee, at his hypocritical air of innocence-&#xD;
and concluded with an appeal to the judges (which was quite&#xD;
unnecessary) to enforce the laws of the country, and see that&#xD;
the punishment, well merited by his crime, be inflicted upon&#xD;
the prisoner.&#xD;
When he had finished, and with a smile of exultation and&#xD;
triumph taken his seat, Bryan was conscious that every sym-&#xD;
pathy excited in his favor was gone. The impression he had&#xD;
made upon the audience and General De Lacy had been&#xD;
brushed away by the cunning and plausible taunts and sneers&#xD;
of the attorney; and now they were all alike convinced of his&#xD;
guilt, and only wondered how they could have ever believed&#xD;
him innocent.&#xD;
'Tis strange! but in ninety-nine cases in a hundred a sneer&#xD;
or laugh will have more influence upon the minds of men&#xD;
than truth or eloquence ! I have no doubt, myself, but that&#xD;
the devil is as much the father of sneerers as he is of liars, and&#xD;
would be willing to take odds that he tempted mother Eve&#xD;
herself with a light laugh.&#xD;
Thestices whispered a moment together; then nodding to&#xD;
each othd, as if both were-satisfied, one of them briefly de-&#xD;
clared the court convinced of the prisoner's guilt, and directed&#xD;
the sheriff to convey him to prison, there to await the sitting&#xD;
of the criminal court.&#xD;
Although nerving himself for the worst, and scarce hoping&#xD;
for acquittal at the hands of the justices, Bryan was visibly&#xD;
agitated .wien he heard their verdict dooming him to a&#xD;
dungeon, and only regained his . self-control by catching a&#xD;
glimpse of the triumphant face of his rival, which steeled his&#xD;
heart at once, and rendered him able to meet the judgment&#xD;
with a quiet look of indifference. This apparent indifference&#xD;
sent a chill through the bosom of the uneasy Montlack; for,&#xD;
although victorious over his rival, he could not conceive the&#xD;
cause of his seeming resignation, unless there was something&#xD;

Duffe, having no hope, and no feeling of pride to sustain him,&#xD;
was overwhelmed with the terrible certainty of his foster-child's&#xD;
conviction and punishment; but Simon, who had been moved&#xD;
even to tears during Bryan's speech, and who could with diffi-&#xD;
culty restrain his anger during the address, of the prosecuting&#xD;
attorney, when he heard the decision of the justices delivered&#xD;
in so careless and heartless a manner, cold restrain his fury&#xD;
no longer, but, springing to his feet, shouted with a voice of&#xD;
thunder.--.&#xD;
"May I be burned at the stake by the bloody Shawanees if&#xD;

and scalped, and burned than stay one night in your darned&#xD;

Come, boy," added the Scout, turning to Bryan, "you've&#xD;

. But none of the audience were at all interested in punishing&#xD;

justices, thinking they had done quite enough to sustain the&#xD;
dignity of the bench by ordering the arrest, whether it was done&#xD;
or not, quietly adjourned, leaving Bryan under the control of&#xD;
the sheriff, and Simon in undisputed possession ofd the court-&#xD;
room.&#xD;
Seeing that his betters had retired, the officer politely re-&#xD;
quested Bryan to accompany him to the prison, which, after a&#xD;
sad parting with Dufe and Simon (the latter still insisting on&#xD;
an appeal to force), he quietly did, waving his last adieu as the&#xD;

heavy doors of the dungeon closed upon him; shutting out, for&#xD;

The wily captain had succeeded, and his designs were now&#xD;
n a fair way of being consummated. The lover Was in prison,&#xD;
the father deceived, and Coma would be the reward of his&#xD;
cessful villany.&#xD;
Rejoicing in hissuccess, Montlack hurried the ust  and&#xD;

Prostrated, hopeless, and crushed in spirit B&#xD;
about in his dreary dungeon.&#xD;
Overwhelmed with sorrow, the honest Sergeant moved slowly&#xD;
and silently on his path homeward.&#xD;
Striding along in company came the gigantic borderer, his&#xD;
eye still red with fury, and his tongue still pouring forth tor-&#xD;

At the lowly hearthstone of the Sergeant, the foster-mother&#xD;

0 CHAPTER XIV.&#xD;
To no one does time travel so slowly as the prisoner; and&#xD;
when I say prisoner, I mean one confined either by sickness or&#xD;
power; and yet, even with him, does the old veteran move glibly&#xD;
enough when he remembers that each day passed brings him&#xD;
one nearer the grave.&#xD;
But with Bryan, the days and nights had been wearily long.&#xD;
More than a week had rolled by since he became the tenant&#xD;
of a dungeon, and although a week is but a moment in an ordi-&#xD;
nary lifetime, his face and appearance already exhibited the&#xD;
effects of confinement. Yet he had not been immured, as some&#xD;
we have read of, in a dark unwholesome dungeon, far away from&#xD;
the genial warmth of, the sun, and totally cut off from the blessed&#xD;
light of day. His jailer had not been a cruel one, nor were&#xD;
the rules of the prison very rigid, or the confinement very close,&#xD;
for around the prison, which had once been the head-quarters&#xD;
of Cornwallis, was a broad sloping lawn, surrounded by a wall&#xD;
some nine feet high, and in this were the prisoners, guarded&#xD;
only by one of the keepers, permitted to spend most of the&#xD;
although Bryan had availed himself of this privilege, he had&#xD;
no intercourse with his fellow-prisoners, and kept aloof from&#xD;
their sports and amusements.&#xD;
They were generally rough, uneducated, and wicked nien,&#xD;
having no associations in common with him; and for whom,&#xD;
and with whom, he had no sympathy.&#xD;
At first they were disposed to be very gracious, and wished&#xD;
to be upon boon terms with their new companion; but Bryan&#xD;
not meeting their advances in a proper spirit, their friendship&#xD;
was soon turned to hatred, and their malevolence began to show&#xD;

itself in numerous petty annoyances and practical jokes, which&#xD;
our hero meeting promptly in the very outset by coolly knock-&#xD;
ing down the leaders of his annoyers, since that period, for&#xD;
it was a striking argument,-and one that could be easily com-&#xD;
prehended by even the dullest mind, he had been left to him-&#xD;
self and -his own bitter and desponding thoughts.&#xD;
But the very privilege of enjoying daily the sun and light,&#xD;
and the pure atmosphere, instead of making his confinement&#xD;
more bearable, only made his dungeon more horrible and tor-&#xD;
menting, and caused him to sigh the more for liberty. The&#xD;
very birds that floated in the pure clear heavens above him, or&#xD;
glided with rapid and sinewy stroke across his vision, reminded&#xD;
him of all that he. had lost, and made him long with aching&#xD;
heart to get once more into the green woods, and wander unre-&#xD;
strained by bar, or bolt, or wall.&#xD;
At such times he would sit and gaze far away up into the&#xD;
blue firmament, and wonder if his father and mother were look-&#xD;
ing down upon him, and knew of the sad and hopeless fate oft&#xD;
their son. Then he would dream of the past, and bring back&#xD;
to memory all the glad days of his youth, and wander in fancy'&#xD;
along the bright sunny streams where in happier hours he had&#xD;
strayed; and, forgetting the present, he would sometimes even&#xD;
dive into the future, and gathergay flowers and weave garlands&#xD;
as rich and brilliant as if no shadow had fallen across his path ;&#xD;
and then again he would be by the side of Coma, upon the&#xD;
shady banks- of the Yadkin, listening to the murmuring notes&#xD;
of the tumbling waters, or the still softer and sweeter tones of&#xD;
her rich and loving voice; and then back once more to the&#xD;
hearthstone of the kind Sergeant would his careering fancy&#xD;
carry him, and again would he look upon the face of his foster-&#xD;
mother, and hear the manly tones of the brave and simple-&#xD;
hearted Kenton, and mingle with him in his wild adventures,&#xD;
and hairbreadth escapes.    -&#xD;
But then would burst upon his ear the loud blasphemy of&#xD;
his wicked companions, and the harsh voice of his jailer; and, in&#xD;
a moment, all of his gay dreams and beautiful fancies, like the -.&#xD;

cheerless cell.&#xD;
A slight shadefofdisappointmenth(lovers are always selfish!)'&#xD;
flitted across the face of Bryan at the appearance of the Scout.&#xD;
liehad aswe have said, been expecting Tiutus, and, what was&#xD;
still more important to him, a letter from Coma; and when he&#xD;
heard the step along the passage, his mind, directed by the in-&#xD;
.nation of the heart, jumped at once to the conclusion that it&#xD;
was his returning messenger; and he could not but feel i&#xD;
spite of his joy at beholding his old frend ad monotar emi&#xD;
tion of discontent.ryeo-&#xD;
But no sooner did he behold, through the loom of&#xD;
geon, the countenance Knoeg               mo his dun..&#xD;

foc  fhis emotion; and sa* a tear of sympathy glistening in&#xD;

"Never mind, Simon; it is not so bad as you imagine. you'll&#xD;
soon get used to this darkness and itas  be ighte;nouh.&#xD;
Don't you see I have 'a window here to give me light and air?"&#xD;
Kenton shuddered as he strained his eyes to pierce the gloom&#xD;
around him; for, although Bryan could see well  heg, h&#xD;
coming immediately from the light, could behold nothingdis-&#xD;
tinctly---not even the person of his greegtdfr-d&#xD;
"Come, sit down, Simon," repeated Bryaen        g&#xD;

ing? and wouldn't it almost induce you to become a prisoner,&#xD;
just to enjoy it ?"&#xD;
Keton groaned, as he looked sharply into the face of his&#xD;
friend; for the simple wanderer of the forest could not ima-&#xD;
ine why Bryan praised the warm and fetid atmosphere of that&#xD;
dreary place, unless, as he feared, he had, from horrid suffering,&#xD;
become deranged.&#xD;
"Don't you find it more pleasant now ?" asked Bryan.&#xD;
"Pleasant !" exclaimed Kenton, with astonishment; "why&#xD;
I would as soon be buried alive! Blast me," he added, his&#xD;
sorrow and surprise giving place to anger, "if I'll ever agin&#xD;
call the redskins cruel! All thar cruelty, sich as runnin the&#xD;
gauntlet, scalping , burnin', and torturin', is jist nothin' when&#xD;
compared with this cussed dungeon, filled with darkness and-&#xD;
suffocatin' air !"&#xD;
"It goes harder with you, Simon, than it does with me and&#xD;
most other persons," replied Bryan, encouragingly,; "you have&#xD;
been so long accustomed to sleeping out under the broad hea-&#xD;
vens, and wandering by day and night through the boundless&#xD;
forests of Kentucky, that you feel cramped for room and air&#xD;
even when you come into the largest houses, let alone a nar-&#xD;
row cell like this."&#xD;
" It may be so, Mr. Bryan; but I don't think I could ever&#xD;
get used to a place like this; for it ain't nat'ral, and feels jist&#xD;
like a grave'! But drat the cussed hole; we won't say anything&#xD;
more 'bout it, for I guess, Mr. Bryan," continued the Scout,&#xD;
his face brightening, "you won't stay here long, for I bring&#xD;
you news that will jist make you walk outer this trap in a&#xD;
hurry; and blast me if you sha'n't lift an Ingen scalp yet,&#xD;
in spite of all of these looks and bars !"&#xD;
"Have you seen Coma ?" inquired Bryan, eagerly.&#xD;
" I hain't done nothin' else," replied Kenton, triumphantly;&#xD;
"   Ibut it took old dodgin', and trailin', and scoutin' to come&#xD;
across the gal; and what's more, when I did start the white&#xD;
doe, I jist up and told her all 'bout the rascality of them&#xD;
(      darned judges and of the gineral; but we won't say anything&#xD;

166                 SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
'bout him, for the gal says the old 'ristocrat's her daddy, though&#xD;
b dn' 'zactly b'ieve it, and I told her so; and I told her all&#xD;
bout that 'tarnal caller Frenchman; and cuss me if I didn't&#xD;
give him pertiklar goss, for I b'lieve he's got nigger blood in&#xD;
him-though the gal did laugh when I said so. And I didn't&#xD;
stop here, Mr. Bryan," added the Scout with breathless haste,&#xD;
"o Ijist made a clean bosom of it while my hand wer' in,&#xD;
and told her- you wer' carrying' on like a darned squaw, lying'&#xD;
up here in this blamed old jail, waitin' for justice, when you&#xD;
know'd, as well as I did, that you weren't goin' to get it; and&#xD;
you needn't be gittin' mad, either, for the gal ar' a sensible&#xD;
critter, and 'greed with me 'zactly, sayin' you wer' a 'tarnal&#xD;
fool, sure enough ! She didn't precisely use them ar' words,&#xD;
Mr. Bryan, but I did, and it wer' all the same for she didn't&#xD;
say anything again it; and what's more, shS told me to say to&#xD;
you, if you could get outer this place (and I told her you could,&#xD;
if you weren't sich a squaw), to get out, and she would' jist go&#xD;
wi   you to Kaintuck, or any other country, for that cussed&#xD;
devil of a Frenchman wer' pesterin' the life outer her, and she&#xD;
couldn't stand it any longer. That's the kind of a gal for a&#xD;
hunter's wife, Mr. Bryan; and darn me, if she don't make the&#xD;
Ingeis stand outer the way when we git .to Kaintuck, Simon&#xD;
Kenton ain't no judge of a spunky woman! If you are ready&#xD;
to leave this 'ere sink-hole, come on; for I'm prepared to take&#xD;
you outside of the gate, and the Sargeant and Titus are close&#xD;
about, to give us a helpin' hand in case of a scrimmage."&#xD;
Bryan was so much astonished'at the unexpected message&#xD;
sent him by the Scout that he never once interrupted his&#xD;
rambling speech; and indeed we don't know that he could have&#xD;
succeeded, had he made the attempt; for the borderer was one&#xD;
of those men (very frequently met with nowadays) who will&#xD;
never hear a reply until quite through with all he has got to&#xD;
say himself; and not even then, if not entirely satisfied he has&#xD;
floored you in the argument. But now that he had halted for&#xD;
breath, Bryan took advantage of the lull to say--&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.             167&#xD;
aI thank you, Simon, for your zeal; but did not Coma send&#xD;
me some written message ?"&#xD;
Wall, darnation, take me if I didn't jist- forget all about&#xD;
it, though I promised the gal to hand it over the first thing I&#xD;
done" replied Kenton,\ drawing from his shot-poucha letter;&#xD;
"cbut here's what she gin ,me, Mister Bryan, though drat me&#xD;
if I precisely see the use on it, for it taint nothin' more than.&#xD;
a little scrap of paper, with some wee black marks on it."&#xD;
And there, sure enough, was a letter from Coma, in her own&#xD;
loved hand, which Bryan, seizing with more zeal than polite-&#xD;
ness, much to the amusement of the borderer, kissed over and&#xD;
over again as he hurried to the little loophole to decipher its&#xD;
contents. Nor did the ecstasy of the lover, or his devotion to&#xD;
the mute messenger sent him by Simon, seem to abate-one jot&#xD;
or tittle as he perused it; for more than once did he stop to&#xD;
kiss some dear word, and give utterance to some broken ex-&#xD;
clamation of rapture and enthusiasm,! And well might he be&#xD;
satisfied, for he had before him traced, by the hand of her he&#xD;
loved so well, assurances of unwavering devotion and affection,&#xD;
which fell like a soothing balm upon his sorrows and fears;&#xD;
coming to his doubting heart like the "Be not afraid-it is I "&#xD;
of Christ to his trembling apostles.&#xD;
In addition to the assurance of her continued affection, Coma&#xD;
made known her unhappy situation; the unceasing pressing of&#xD;
his hateful suit by Montlack; and the harsh commands of her&#xD;
father to prepare for immediate marriage with her detested&#xD;
cousin. But she assured her lover that death would be pre-&#xD;
ferable to such a union; and die she would rather than call&#xD;
Montlack by the sacred name of husband I "My father calls&#xD;
my opposition to a marriage with my treacherous cousin," she&#xD;
continued, ast  bborn infatuation, and swears (0 Bryan ! 'tis&#xD;
terrible to hear a father swear !) that, willing or not, I shall&#xD;
become his wife ! But he does not yet know his Coma, for die&#xD;
I can, and will, ere I consummate this unholy connection!I"&#xD;
" There ist only one course left us, Bryan," she added, in ano-&#xD;
thcr part of her letter, "and Captain Kenton presses me to&#xD;
&#xD;

pursue it; and though my face burns at the thought of mention-&#xD;
ing it, still, as my father harshly refuses to listen to my pray-&#xD;
ers and entreaties, I will declare it : and it is to fly, and fly at&#xD;
once, and together (for Kenton assures me you can escape with-&#xD;
out danger) to the beautiful lands beyond the mountains !"&#xD;
During the time consumed by Bryan in reading the letter&#xD;
from Coma, Kenton,-in better-spirits than he had been since&#xD;
he entered the dungeon, sat with praiseworthy silence upon the&#xD;
bed of the lover, minutely examining the furniture of the room,&#xD;
as if a civil officer making out an inventory of movables for a&#xD;
levy; but he was not so intent in his occupation as to forget&#xD;
Bryan, for, ever and anon, as the latter muttered some excla-&#xD;
mation of pleasure, would he turn his eye with a knowing&#xD;
smile at thg reader, and chuckle to himself, as if well satisfied&#xD;
with the influence of the silent messenger, But when Bryan&#xD;
had finished, and with impassioned vehemence had again and&#xD;
again pressed his lips upon the signature of Coma, the bor-&#xD;
derer, no longer able to control his impatience, interrupted this&#xD;
loving pantomime by quietly saying--&#xD;
"Well, now, Mr. Bryan, I s'pose you are ready to go?"&#xD;
"Ay!1" replied Bryan, his countenance glowing with plea-&#xD;
sure; "and to go with you, my brave Simon, to the broad val-&#xD;
leys' of the mighty Mississippi-the glorious pastures of the&#xD;
countless buffalo,"&#xD;
"Hurrah, boy! that's the way. to talk it !" shouted the&#xD;
Scout, grasping Bryan's hand. "We'll have glorious times&#xD;
yet, and you shall lift the scalp-lock of a dodgin' Wyandotte&#xD;
before another moon, or my name ain't. Sharp-Eye. But let's&#xD;
leave this 'ere cussed place, and go out at once into the woods,&#xD;
for I don't feel easy and nat'ral-like with them ar' doors and&#xD;
walls atween me and daylight."&#xD;
" But how are we to go ?" said Bryan..&#xD;
"Nothin' easier," replied Kenton, examining the prining&#xD;
of his rifle. " When this 'ere lock-up feller opens the door for&#xD;
me, you jist walk out."]&#xD;
" The keeper will not allow it."&#xD;

he opens his mouth, I'll knock. him down; and if that ar'n't&#xD;
satisfactory, old Betsy and me will stand atween you and all&#xD;
danger till beyond the walls."&#xD;
" That will never do," said Bryan, shaking his head. "I&#xD;
will not endanger the lives either of the jailers or yourself by&#xD;
attempting so open and rash an undertaking."&#xD;
"Never mind 'bout me or the jailer. If he kills me, or I&#xD;
him, that's our look-out, and none of your'n," said the Scout,&#xD;
stubbornly.&#xD;
"It can't be, Simon. I love you too well to put your life&#xD;
in jeopardy," said Bryan; "nor would I willingly injure one&#xD;
of my jailers; for they are but doing their duty, and, more than&#xD;
that, have been very kind, and have allowed me many privi-&#xD;
leges."&#xD;
"Blasted kind, indeed !" exclaed Kenton,,in, a sneering&#xD;
voice, glancing quickly around at the cheerless, unfurnished&#xD;
cell; "and they desarve a powerful chance of gratitude for this&#xD;
'ere precious comfortable lodgin' they've given you."&#xD;
"My keepers have nothing to do with the making or fuirnish-&#xD;
ing of these cells, Simon; but they might have:'made my im-&#xD;
prisonment far less endurable, if they had been .so disposed ;&#xD;
ad Ii owe them some gratitude, at least, for the many little&#xD;
favors they have granted me."&#xD;
" Well, darn me if you ain't thankful for small favors !"&#xD;
said Kenton, with increased bitterness. « I'd think toma-&#xD;

"But the law ?"&#xD;

since I've, been in the States. I'll never feel easy agin till I&#xD;
forget thar's any sich a thing."&#xD;
"Hold, Simon !" exclaimed Bryan; "I hear the step of the&#xD;
jailer coming to lead me out into the prison yard. I cannot&#xD;
agree to your plan of escape, for it might result in death either&#xD;
to you or one of my keepers; but I have one of my own,&#xD;
equally certain, less dangerous; and, to accomplish it, I will-&#xD;
need no assistance."&#xD;
"What is it ?" said Kenton, discontentedly.&#xD;
I have not time to explain now," replied Bryan; "and if&#xD;
I had, I fear, when you heard my scheme, you would not ap-&#xD;
prove of it; but be you on the south side of the prison inclo-&#xD;
sure to-morrow about this time, and if I do not'}then make my&#xD;
escape, I promise you, on the day succeeding, to attempt your&#xD;
plan, which, from its boldness and unexpected daring, I have&#xD;
no doubt will prove success"&#xD;
"I'l go my scalp on it," said Kenton, in a little better&#xD;
humor, now that he had the promise-of Bryan. "They won't&#xD;
be specting sich a piece of impudene, aid will neither be ready&#xD;
to prevent our escape, nor do us an injury. But remember,&#xD;
you've given me your word, and I'll 'spect you to try my plan,&#xD;
if you don't give them the dodge to-morrow."&#xD;
"I will; for I have made up my mind to remain here no&#xD;
longer," replied Bryan, grasping the hand of the Scout as a&#xD;
pledge of his determination.&#xD;
The entrance of the jailer put an end to further conversation.&#xD;
&amp;amp;imon shook the hand of his friend, and, after a secret look&#xD;
of intelligence and encouragement, turned upon his heel and&#xD;
stalked boldly along the corridor, and down through the gate,&#xD;
neither turning his head to the right nor left; but with a quick&#xD;
roll of the eye making an accurate map in his own mind of ge&#xD;
entire plan of the prison. His face, when he rejoined the Ser-&#xD;
geant and Titus, wore a mingled expression of satisfaction and&#xD;
discontent, and so intimately combined and balanced were these&#xD;
two feelings, that Duffe, although a shrewd reader of faces, was&#xD;
totally unable to unravel the result of his meeting with Bryan,&#xD;
&#xD;
n&#xD;
"Y&#xD;
M,&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.            171&#xD;
or say which of these emotions preponderated. Nor did the&#xD;
stubborn borderer seem inclined to be very communicative; for&#xD;
he stalked along with the dogged determination of an Indian&#xD;
warrior undergoing torture, and made no reply to the inquiries&#xD;
of his companion, or, if any, only in muttered monosyllables.&#xD;
With a light heart and bright face, Bryan followed the jailer&#xD;
to the prison yard. When there, contrary to his usual reserved&#xD;
course, he drew near to a little knot of prisoners engaged in the&#xD;
athletic sport of leaping the rope, and, for the first time during&#xD;
his confinement, exhibited an interest in their amusement.&#xD;
The prison yard, or rather outer court, sloped gradually from&#xD;
the buildings to the wall, inclosing the prison area, leaving the&#xD;
jail standing on the highest point of a conical hill, with a broad&#xD;
green belt between it and the wall encircling its base; thus&#xD;
furnishing a most admirable place for the sport in which the&#xD;
prisoners were now engaged.&#xD;
One of them, noticing the approach of our hero, and the seem-&#xD;
ing interest with which, for the first time, he regarded their&#xD;
amusement, exclaimed, with a mocking laugh--&#xD;
"Heyday, boys! here's our- fine jay.  I wonder if he&#xD;
wouldn't like to risk his valuable neck over a three foot rope?&#xD;
Come! give him a trial! hold it up there, boys-that's it.&#xD;
Now try your activity, my young blood. Who'll take a bet&#xD;
that he don't get a tumble ?"&#xD;
This sally was greeted with a loud laugh ; but Bryan, con-&#xD;
trary to their expectation, met it with a good-humored smile,&#xD;
saying, pleasantly-&#xD;
"I'll take your bet; but put the rope to five feet."&#xD;
I"Ha ! ha !" laughed the first speaker; "let him have it so,&#xD;
boys; for he'll get a fine tumble to a certainty."&#xD;
Those holding the rope hoisted it to the required height;&#xD;
and Bryan, without delay or any apparent struggle, leaped lightly,&#xD;
down the hill and sprang over it.&#xD;
"Lost !" exclaimed the same speaker, with an oath; but&#xD;
struck with Bryan's graceful carriage and activity, he added, in&#xD;

a more pleasant tone: "The boy is better stuff than I thought&#xD;
him."&#xD;
"tPut up the rope to six feet !" exclaimed Bryan, returning&#xD;
to the, stand.g&#xD;
"Better stop, boy, at what you've done," said one.&#xD;
"lie wants to get a tumble," said another.&#xD;
SBg,                  e rope was placed at the required&#xD;
height; and again, with great ease, he cleared it, amidst the&#xD;
loud acclamations of his surprised companions.&#xD;

jacket, and who seemed to     he sg&#xD;
- "A t' enjoy the sprt amazingly',&#xD;
hi rsyou please," replied Bryan, coolly; " for I have jumped&#xD;
higher."I&#xD;
While the wondering rope-holders were adjusting it to the&#xD;
proper height, Bryan threw off his coat and shoes, and no sooner&#xD;
had they called out "all ready !" thn like a bounding stag, he&#xD;
again went safely over it   .&#xD;

"I'm not so certain of that," said his opponent, as he quietly&#xD;
measuredithe wall with his eye; "and if I win this last bet,&#xD;
blast me if I don't go you a five on the wall."&#xD;
Bryan smiled.&#xD;
"There's no danger of your being called on to stand up to&#xD;
this offer," growled the loser; "for you'll never win the wager&#xD;
we have just made."&#xD;
Again Bryan smiled.&#xD;
"We'll see," said the jockey, with the confident look and tone&#xD;
of a veteran sportsman.&#xD;
"Ay, we'll see !" muttered Bryan, as he walked away.&#xD;
CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
To-MoRaOW had come, and Bryan had paced his narrow dun-&#xD;
geon with uneasy rapidity, dreaming of escape.&#xD;
Suddenly his attention was drawn to a footstep along the&#xD;
passage, the door of his cell was thrown open, and Montlack&#xD;
stood before him.&#xD;
A flush of anger mantled the prisoner's brow as he beheld&#xD;
the person of his treacherous rival; but when the door had&#xD;
again closed, leaving them together, with a quick gesture of&#xD;
surprise and impatience, Bryan exclaimed-&#xD;
"IHow now, sir ! to what freak do I owe this unwelcome and&#xD;
unlooked-for visit ?"{&#xD;
"To no' freak !" replied Montlack, "but to an earnest hope&#xD;
and desire that this meeting would result in your liberty and&#xD;
my happiness."&#xD;
"Iahave already had convincing proof of the honor and good-&#xD;
will of Captain Montlack !" said Bryan, bitterly.&#xD;
"You have also had some cause to know my power and de-&#xD;
termination" sneered the captain; "but I would now in a man-&#xD;
ner atone for my harshness and want of faith by set ng you at&#xD;

liberty, did you but have a graib of reason or common sense&#xD;
about you !"&#xD;
"I acknowledge Captain Montlack greatly my superior in&#xD;
treachery and duplicity " remarked Bryan, coldly; "but still&#xD;
must flatter myself. enough to believer that I have yet some&#xD;
reason left, at least a sufficient amount to know that Captain&#xD;
Montlack does not expect to give liberty unless for a valuable&#xD;
consideration."&#xD;
"«The most sensible remark I've heard from you yet, and it&#xD;
proves to me that you have still some brains left!" sneered&#xD;
ontlack, with a slight attempt at good-humor.&#xD;
Your company is not the most agreeable, and your remarks&#xD;
far from being pleasant," replied Bryan, haughtily; "1and if&#xD;
Captain Montlack has no other design than to exult over the&#xD;
victim of his treachery, I would gladly be freed both from his&#xD;
presence and conversation !"&#xD;
" No more of such nonsense, Mr. Head, I pray you!" replied&#xD;
Montlack, assuming a patronizing and familiar tone; "I came&#xD;
not here to boast of my superior cunning, or to exult over your&#xD;
present unfortunate condition, but purely on a matter of busi-&#xD;
ness; hoping that a little plain straightforward talk would set&#xD;
all things right between us, and result in your being freed from&#xD;
captivity, and myself from all fear of your presence in this part&#xD;
of the country. Eh ! do you take ?"&#xD;
By assuming an air of cold politeness, Bryan had so far been&#xD;
able to restrain his anger and contempt for the captain; but&#xD;
the affected tone of patronizing familiarity, or rather community&#xD;
of baseness and crimiality put on by the latter, was more than&#xD;
his patience or politeness could bear; and now, with a look and&#xD;
voice of scorn, he exclaimed--&#xD;
"I wish you, Captain Montlack, to understand now, and at&#xD;
once and forever, that I have no feeling in common with you,&#xD;
and that I consider -you a base, treacherous, and dishonorable&#xD;
man; and did I not know that you were a coward, and that I&#xD;
would disgrace myself by striking you, I would now take richly&#xD;
-merited vengeance both for past and present insults !"&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.        175&#xD;
&#xD;
"Psha, man !" said Montlack, in his usual mocking voice,&#xD;
"I understand your feelings exactly, and have come prepared&#xD;
for all such outbursts ! My visit, as I've already said, is purely&#xD;
one of business; and as to my bravery or cowardice, that is not&#xD;
the question; but I am most happy,-I assure you, that you have&#xD;
determined to be peaceable; for," added the captain, significantly&#xD;
touching the handle of a pistol in his bosom, "I have come&#xD;
prepared either for peace or war, but would prefer the first, as&#xD;
I have no desire to add murder to my other little sins."~&#xD;
"Do not presume too much upon my patience !" said Bryan,&#xD;
sternly ; "for by heavens a very little aggravation would make&#xD;
me dash out your brains in spite of your weapons !"&#xD;
md I do not wish or intend to presume upon my being armed,"&#xD;
said Montlack, hurriedly, for he was somewhat alarmed at the&#xD;
threatening look of his victim; "and only wish to make you a&#xD;
fair and advantageous offer, which I trust you will accept; but&#xD;
if you do not, then I will have no more to say, and will go away,&#xD;
regretting the ill success of my mission !"&#xD;
"You may go on, sir ! I am willing to hear you; but it may&#xD;
be well enough to add," replied Bryan, looking him steadily in&#xD;
the face, "that I place no confidence in anything you may&#xD;
say or do, for you have already proved yourself a base hypo-&#xD;
crite and traitor; and, still more, with the design to incarcerate&#xD;
me in a dungeon, you have added to these the foul .crime of&#xD;
perjury ! You can no longer deceive me, for I have no faith&#xD;
either in your word or oath, and am therefore ready to hear,&#xD;
what you may have to say !&#xD;
"I have outgeneralled you  I'll acknowledge," said Mont-&#xD;
lack, attempting to laugh off the heavy charges of Bryan; " but&#xD;
you know all stratagems are fair in love or war .?&#xD;
"I don't know or admit any such rule of conduct," remarked&#xD;
Head, coldly; "for no mean or dishonorable .action is admissi-&#xD;
ble either in love or war, or at any time, or under any circum-&#xD;
stance; and there is no trite adage of the world more groundless&#xD;
or untenable than the one you have just mentioned."&#xD;
"Well, we won't discuss this matter now," replied Montlack;&#xD;

176                  SIMON KENTON;&#xD;
"and as you are not disposed to give me credit for any feeling&#xD;
other than selfishness, I will at once to the design and intent.&#xD;
of my present visit."&#xD;
"Do so, and be as brief as possible," said Head, "for, to tell&#xD;
you the truth, I am getting weary of your pointless hints and&#xD;
allusions."&#xD;
"Then to be candid" (Bryan smiled), "I have come," con-&#xD;
tinued Montlack, "to liberate you, but upon condition that ou&#xD;
swear to me to leave the country, and never again meet or cor-&#xD;
respond with my cousin, Coma De Lacy! Don't start, as if&#xD;
you thought my proposition a very grievous one; for, if you&#xD;
will but look at it a moment, you'll see that by accepting my&#xD;
offer you gain your freedom and lose nothing."&#xD;
"Do you count the hand of your cousin nothing ?n&#xD;
"It can be nothing to you, and certainly you have no hope&#xD;
now of obtaining the hand of my cousin. Why, she looks upon&#xD;
you, after what has occurred, with the utmost contempt, and&#xD;
hates you all the more because -she once loved; and, besides,&#xD;
if she loved you even as she did before she believed you a&#xD;
base criminal,. the general would never consent to your nup.&#xD;
trials "&#xD;
"But'what if she, rebelling against the unjust tyranny'of&#xD;
her father, say she will be mine without his consent?" said&#xD;
Bryan.&#xD;
"No danger of that; she has been too well drilled by the&#xD;
old general to disobey orders," laughed Montlack. "But everf,&#xD;
for argument's sake, admitting what you say to be true, still,-if&#xD;
you remain here in confinement, of which there is but little,&#xD;
doubt if you do not accept my offer, then there is and can be&#xD;
no hope of your marriage."&#xD;
" Hope is gone only with life," said Bryan.&#xD;
"Bah !" continued Montlack; "a sentiment worthy only of&#xD;
a lovesick boy. Look at this matter rationally, and you will&#xD;
see at once that all hope of your success is now gone and for-&#xD;
ever."&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.-177&#xD;
&#xD;
' The past is beyond our reach ; but no man can speak for&#xD;
the future," replied Bryan.&#xD;
"In this case, the future will not be long," said Montlack,&#xD;
" for in a week, by the consent of herself, I marry Coma; so&#xD;
you might as well submit at once, agree to my terms, and hunt&#xD;
out some other sweetheart, since this one is beyond your&#xD;
reach."&#xD;
"Have you anything more to say ?" asked Bryan, calmly.&#xD;
" Only," replied Montlack, with a well satisfied look-for,&#xD;
deceived by the calmness of Bryan, he considered success cer-&#xD;
tain-" as you seem to be reasonable, and willing toedo what is&#xD;
right, I will repay you the one thousand dollars borrowed, and&#xD;
which I never intended to retain."&#xD;
" Nothing more?" asked Head.&#xD;
" Well! I am disposed to be liberal with you," replied the&#xD;
captain, misunderstanding the tenor of Bryan's question; "and&#xD;
as I have been the cause of your imprisonment, won't stand on&#xD;
a few thousand more to put you all tight with the world&#xD;
again.&#xD;
"But my character ?" suggested Bryan. " You know I rest&#xD;
under the charge of forgery?"&#xD;
" Psha !" exclaimed Montlack ; u"nobody will ever inquire&#xD;
respecting your character so long as you have plenty of money.&#xD;
'Tis the poor devils whose character is always hunted out, and&#xD;
not the rich."&#xD;
"But why," asked Bryan, wishing to fathom, if possible,&#xD;
his enemy's designs, "1are you so interested in my leaving the&#xD;
country?  Would it not answer your purpose just as well&#xD;
for me to continue in prison?"&#xD;
"Just as well, so far as my marriage is concerned," replied&#xD;
Montlack.&#xD;
" Then why trouble yourself about my liberation ?"&#xD;
"Don't you think I have some heart left? and that I would&#xD;
naturally feel remorse at keeping an innocent man in prison,&#xD;
when I had gained'my end? Besides," added Montlack, with&#xD;
a quick glance at. the unmoved countenance of his rival, " Co-&#xD;

&#xD;
ma has asked me, and I can deny her nothing, to use my&#xD;
influence in sending you away out of the country, as it would&#xD;
be very painful to her ever to meet you again."&#xD;
"By heavens! captain," exclaimed Bryan, "you are indeed&#xD;
a deep and cunning scoundrel! But you have deceived me&#xD;
once, and can never do it again. I would be weak and foolish&#xD;
to insanity to place confidence in the word of a man that had&#xD;
willingly and intentionally committed perjury, and in every&#xD;
way proved himself a base and unprincipled traitor ! Besides,&#xD;
I know all that you have just spoken to be false; and that&#xD;
Coma, at this very moment, hates and detests you; and, instead&#xD;
of remembering me with scorn and contempt, has for me the&#xD;
same esteem and confidence that she had before she had heard&#xD;
your reckless and groundless slander."&#xD;
"You had better put some rein upon your tongue," said&#xD;
Montlack, menacingly, "or my patience may give way, and I&#xD;
will leave you to die like a miserable dog in this cell ! For&#xD;
the last time; "I now offer you liberty. Will you accept my&#xD;
proposition, and go free ? or will you, like a maudlin fool,&#xD;
refuse it, and remain forever the tenant of a dungeon ?"&#xD;
"Neither," replied Bryan, emphatically; "I scorn your&#xD;
offers, and defy your hatred ! I wil yet go forth from this&#xD;
cell, and will again see Miss De Lacy, and trust, in spite of all&#xD;
yoir opposition, and in spite of your treachery and defamation&#xD;
some day to call her my own ! You have my answer and my&#xD;
-determination; and I beg now to be freed from your loathsome&#xD;
presence."&#xD;
Chagrined at the defeat of his plans, and furious at the con-&#xD;
fident prophecy of his rival, Montlack was 'about to pour forth&#xD;
a volume of abuse and bitter mockery upon the head of Bryan,&#xD;
when he was interrupted by the appearance of the jailer, and&#xD;
compelled to remain silent.&#xD;
At the command of the keeper, our hero, with his mind&#xD;
intent upon executing his determined plan of escape, left his&#xD;
cell and hurried away, scarcely noticing, as he passed out, the&#xD;
&#xD;
179&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
scowling and malevolent countenance of his defeated and dis-&#xD;
comfited enemy.&#xD;
Bryan was received with a shout, and soont surrounded by&#xD;
his fellow-prisoners, eager to behold another display of his&#xD;
wonderful activity. "Shooting-Jacket" and his opponent were&#xD;
clamorous for the immediate decision of their bet. Nothing&#xD;
loath, our hero gave his ready assent, and immediately te&#xD;
prison yard became boisterous with yells of applause and en-&#xD;
couragement.  Bryan quietly stripped himself for the trial;&#xD;
the jockey, after he had seen the rope placed at eight and a&#xD;
half feet, lending his assistance.&#xD;
" Now, my young antelope," said "4Shooting-Jacket," encou-&#xD;
ragingly, "a bold effort for the rope; and then," he added, in&#xD;
a lower tone, with a significant look, " a grand struggle for the&#xD;
wall and liberty!"&#xD;
Bryan started with terror at this unexpected remark of his&#xD;
companion, and looked quickly around to see if any other ' d&#xD;
noticed it; but the jockey, divining his thoughts, soon quieted&#xD;
his fears by muttering, in a low voice-I        le   u&#xD;
" Don't be uneasy, for no one suspects you. I smelled out&#xD;
the game; but jum 's the word, and blast me if I ever'peach."&#xD;
-Bryan grasped his hand, but said nothing.&#xD;
A group of citizens, drawn hither by the report of Bryan's&#xD;
wonderful activity, and of the trial to be made on this morn-&#xD;
ing, stood inside the prison yard; and along with them, attracted&#xD;
by the same curiosity, were most of the turnkeys and officers&#xD;
of the establishment.&#xD;
On his way out, Montlacl's attention was drawn to this un-&#xD;
usual group; and when informed by the jailer the cause of their&#xD;
presence, and of the excitement very apparent throughout the&#xD;
yard, stopped and joined their company. His only design in&#xD;
stopping was to exult over his victim, for he hoped that he&#xD;
would fail in his attempt; or, what would be still more pleas-&#xD;
ing to him, would break his neck, and thus free him forever of&#xD;
his hated presence.&#xD;
But his hopes and wishes were destined alike to meet wit&#xD;

disappointment, for, at the word, Bryan bounded lightly for-&#xD;
ward, and with a desperate effort cleared the rope!&#xD;
A wild shout of applause greeted his success.&#xD;
Montlack muttered an oath.&#xD;
"Now for the wall!1" whispered the jockey, drawing near to&#xD;
Bryan.&#xD;
_ " Ay !now for the wall and liberty," was the low, but firm&#xD;
reply.&#xD;
"Don't try it," said one of the prisoners, looking at the rope,&#xD;
now raised a half foot higher.&#xD;
Bryan smiled; the jockey looked around knowingly; the&#xD;
crowd of citizens and keepers drew nearer, and along with them&#xD;
Montlack, now so confident of his hated rival's failure as to&#xD;
offer a bet of fifty dollars, which was immediately taken by one&#xD;
of the bystanders.&#xD;
The signal given, Bryan raised his cap, and, looking with a&#xD;
-smile into the scowling countenance of Montlack, shouted, "Au&#xD;
revoir, Monsieur le Capitaine;" then springing forward, passed&#xD;
under the rope, and with a mighty effort, to the amazement&#xD;
of. every one but the jockey, cleared the wall, and was gone!&#xD;
There was a moment of stupid wonder; then loud cries of&#xD;
"Catch him !" mingled with the laughter and exultation of the&#xD;
prisoners, and hurried movements of the keepers in pursuit;&#xD;
but Montlack, furious at the escape of his hated rival, -had&#xD;
already sprung upon his horse, and was urging him onward with&#xD;
whip and spur, hoping to ride down the fugitive before he had&#xD;
reached the woods.&#xD;
It was an open, level space, some four hundred yards in&#xD;
width, between the wall of the prison yard and the forest; and&#xD;
the spectators, standing near the jail on the top of the cone-&#xD;
shaped hill, could witness the entire chase--the flight and pur-&#xD;
suit.&#xD;
"Go it, my brave fellow !" shouted the jockey, throwing up&#xD;
his hat; "once in the forest, and you are safe!"&#xD;
" The captain is gaining on him I" exclaimed one of the&#xD;
keepers.&#xD;
&#xD;

It"I hope he'll escape," replied a citizen; a"for he's too gallant&#xD;
a fellow to be cooped up in a dungeon."&#xD;
"The captain is within fifty yards of him, and there's a hun-&#xD;
dred to go yet!" exclaimed the jailer, exultingly.&#xD;
"Damn that captainI" shouted one of the prisoners; "he&#xD;
has drawn a pistol, and will fire at the boy."&#xD;
"I hope not," said the jailer, "for I would rather see him&#xD;
escape."&#xD;
"If he does, I'll see that he is punished," exclaimed the&#xD;
same citizen, in an excited tone, "for it will be a base and&#xD;
cowardly murder."&#xD;
But at this moment, when Montlack, with extended arm and&#xD;
flashing eye, was levelling his pistol, the spectators around the&#xD;
jail beheld a light puff of smoke sweep up from the skirt of&#xD;
the forest, followed by the sharp report of a rifle ;' and simul-&#xD;
taneously with the smoke and report, the gallant steed of the&#xD;
pursuer dropped lifeless to the ground, hurling the person of&#xD;
his rider far over his head.&#xD;
"A good shot, that, by the devils" exclaimed the jockey.&#xD;
"I'm sorry for the horse, but blast me if I don't hope the&#xD;
damned captain has got his quietus!i"&#xD;
"sHurrah !" shouted the prisoners; "he has escaped I"&#xD;
" And I trust will never find his way back," said the sympa-&#xD;
thizing citizen, preparing to follow the footsteps of the jailer,&#xD;
now hurrying to the assistance of the luckless captain.&#xD;
"Faith ! and -may your honor 'live a thousand years, and&#xD;
never be without whiskey or praters !" shouted a merry Irish-&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"Why not wish him in heaven at once ?" laughed a by-&#xD;
stander.&#xD;
"I know all about whiskey and craters," said the Irishman,&#xD;
good-humoredly, "hbut divil the bit about heaven; so I jist&#xD;
made for him an Irish prayer; and may he never hear worse 1"&#xD;
"I'll take that five !" said the jockey, in a quiet tone, as he&#xD;
turned his eyes from the forest where the person of Bryan had&#xD;
just vanished, to the countenance of his unlucky opponent.&#xD;

"Shooting-Jacket" looked a. little confounded at this unex-&#xD;
pected reply; but seeing no help for it, like a wise man, joined&#xD;
in the laugh of his fellow prisoners against himself, and said&#xD;
nothing more.&#xD;
CHAPTER XVI,&#xD;
A WEEK had passed since the escape of Bryan. During this&#xD;
period, Duffe had been busily engaged preparing to move west.&#xD;
The jailer, urged on by De Lacy and Montlack, had made some&#xD;
slight effort to ferret out the fugitive; but, had met with no&#xD;
success. Satisfied at length that Bryan, along with Kenton,&#xD;
had fled the country, all parties rested at ease save the discom.&#xD;
fited captain. The latter, sorely bruised in person, and morti-&#xD;
fied in spirit, tossed about upon his weary bed, cursing his&#xD;
rival; warning the general to keep a strict watch over Coma;&#xD;
and, greatly troubled in mind lest the lovers might meet again,&#xD;
and perhaps (that was the most galling thought of the schemer!),&#xD;
without waiting the consent of her father, put an end to all of&#xD;
his hopes and designs by a clandestine marriage.&#xD;
But the captain was now so far recovered from his bruises as&#xD;
to leave his bed, and so restless and uneasy had he become&#xD;
that, in spite of the pain it gave him, had, called for his horse&#xD;
and ridden to the village,,to make inquiries himself respecting&#xD;
the fugitive.  etter satisfied by personal examination than&#xD;
he had been by the reports of his uncle, Montlack was now on&#xD;
his return to the mansion; when, at a sudden bend in the path&#xD;
he was slowly pursuing, much to his astonishment, and with no&#xD;
little trepidation, he found himself in the unwelcome presence&#xD;
of Kenton. Touching his horse lightly, Montlack would have&#xD;

passed on without so much as a salutation; but Simon, with a&#xD;
pleasant smile, barred his way, at the same time good-humoredly&#xD;
exclaiming-&#xD;
S"'Mazin' glad to see you, casting ; have been on the look-&#xD;
gut ever since I hearn you had made up your mind to git well&#xD;
agin; for blast me if I liked the idea. of leavin' this 'ere blessed&#xD;
country without tellin' you good-by, and gittin' a lock of your&#xD;
hair to 'member you when I got among the savages."&#xD;
"I have had quite enough of your pleasantry, Mr. Kenton,&#xD;
and would thank you to step out of the path, and let- me pass,"&#xD;
replied Montlack, surlily.&#xD;
"If it ar' all the same to you, casting," said the Scout, with-&#xD;
out moving, "I am very well satisfied, and if you ain't, and&#xD;
want to pass afore- Isay the'word, then you'll jist have to ride&#xD;
over me, that's all!"&#xD;
"Which I'll soon do," exclaimed Montlack, becoming en-&#xD;
raged at the cool indifference of Kenton, "unless you give me&#xD;
the road."&#xD;
"This ar' a free country," said Kenton, with a low laugh,&#xD;
as if amused at the thought, "and may-be you will-and may.-&#xD;
be you won't; but darn me, if you try it, if I don't spile. the&#xD;
figure-head of your horse like I did that ar' one the other&#xD;
day !"&#xD;
. " And to you I owe the death of my fine gray, and my own&#xD;
bruises, do I?" said Montlack, savagely.&#xD;
"Not -Zactly to me, but to old Betsy," said Kenton, tapping&#xD;
his rifle; "but you ought. to be -darned glad, capting, that I'm&#xD;
sich a good shot; for if it had been any other, the bullet might&#xD;
have been in your head 'stead of your horse's; and cuss me if&#xD;
I think it would have been much harm if it had. I thought&#xD;
first, darn me if I didn't, casting, when I saw you draw  ur&#xD;
pistol on Mr. Bryan, of aimin' at you, but eludedd it wer n't&#xD;
right, as you didn't 'spect it, and so took the horse; and you&#xD;
ought to be powerful much obliged to me, instead of gittin in&#xD;

eame time urging his horse a few paces nearer the unflinching&#xD;
borderer; ."my course is in that direction, and I don't wish to&#xD;
bandy further words with you."&#xD;
"I reckon you've taken the wrong path, casting," said Ken-&#xD;
ton, quietly, at the same time presenting his rifle, "for blast me,&#xD;
if you come another step nearer, though I'd, be darned sorry to&#xD;
kill so fine a critter, I'1 have to give you another tumble!"&#xD;
"What do you mean by thus stopping me on the highway ?"&#xD;
exclaimed Montlack, drawing back his horse. "I cannot con-&#xD;
ceive your intention, unless you design robbery."&#xD;
"It wouldn't be much wrong if I did, as you robbed Mister&#xD;
Bryan; but Simon Kenton is no robber, and you need have no&#xD;
fears for your purse."&#xD;
"If you have anything to say to me, do so at-once, and let&#xD;
me pass."&#xD;
"I hain't got much to say, casting, for I ain't pertickler anx-&#xD;
ious to talk with ,a feller what's. got nigger blood in him, and&#xD;
a darned parjured scamp at that! All I want jist now is for&#xD;
you to right 'bout face, as the Sargeant would say, and keep&#xD;
that ar' path till I say stop., Jist be turning' your horse, will&#xD;
you ?" added the Scout sternly, at the same time glancing his&#xD;
eye up at the sun; "for we ain't got no time to spare, and go&#xD;
you shall, for I'm 'termined on that!"&#xD;
" Why do you wish me to turn back ?" said Montlack,&#xD;
glancing uneasily at the stern and determined countenance of&#xD;
Simon.&#xD;
"Never mind 'bout that," replied Kenton; "you'll find it&#xD;
out soon enough. You made me stand like a fool behind a&#xD;
tree t'other day ; while you, like a 'tarnal nigger, slipped away!&#xD;
I'm goin' to have my reyenge now, capting, and am after&#xD;
talin' you to a weddin' whar thar'll be no dancing . So right&#xD;
'bout face ! March ! For Sharp-Eye ain't going' to be fooled&#xD;
twice by a cussed yaller Frenchman without takin' satisfaction!"&#xD;
Seeing that Kenton was in earnest, Montlack had no other&#xD;

punishment at the hands of Bryan and his friends, and doubted&#xD;
not he was now about to receive it. But the captain had not&#xD;
ridden a hundred paces, followed closely by Kenton, before he&#xD;
began turning over in his own mind the chances of escape by&#xD;
a rapid and sudden flight;, and it seemed that Simon had fears&#xD;
very near akin to the hopes of his captive, for suddenly, just'&#xD;
as the captain had fully made up his mii4 to the dangerous&#xD;
undertaking, Kenton called out in - a quick and peremptory&#xD;
voice-&#xD;
"Halt, Mister Capting! I'm of the 'pinion that we had&#xD;
better change our plan of march."&#xD;
Coming up to the side of Montlack, who had silently obeyed&#xD;
this command, Simon drew from his shot-pouch a strong cord,&#xD;
at the same time sternly ordering him to cross his hands; but the&#xD;
captain, divining at once his intention, refused to submit to 0&#xD;
degrading a request, and it was not until Kenton, levelling his&#xD;
rifle, ordered him in a threatening voice to do as he was bid,&#xD;
that he could bring himself to yield.&#xD;
But between death and dishonor, the worthy captain, with a&#xD;
worldly care for his person, had no thought of hesitating, so,&#xD;
crossing his hands as he was bid, he quietly submitted to be&#xD;
bound. His prisoner, secured to his entire satisfaction, Kenton,&#xD;
drawing -the bridle-rein over his own arm, once more stalked&#xD;
rapidly onward. Ever and anon, as he walked swiftly along&#xD;
through the woods, the borderer would glance over his shoulder&#xD;
at the rueful countenance of Montlack, giving utterance, as he&#xD;
did so, to a low chuckle of delight. His secret cogitations,&#xD;
judging from the. expression of his face, were decidedly of an&#xD;
amusing character. But, without again halting, for, from his&#xD;
frequent glances at the declining sun, he seemed to be in a&#xD;
hurry, Kenton pursued the most direct route to the house of&#xD;
Duffe, and very soon commanded a halt in front of the farm-&#xD;
house.&#xD;
Montlack, as he rode up, noticed several horses, fully&#xD;
equipped, as if for a long journey; but he was not allowed&#xD;
much time for observation; for Kenton, aiding him to dismount,&#xD;

SIMON KENTON,&#xD;
&#xD;
hurried him to the house, and, pushing in the door, exclaimed,&#xD;
with a roguish look at the company--.&#xD;
I hope the thing ain't over, for Capting Montlack is power-&#xD;
ful anxious to see the weddin'."&#xD;
The company addressed by Simon consisted of Duffe and&#xD;
his wife, Bryai and Coma, a minister, and old Titus; and they&#xD;
were on the eve of celebrating the rites of marriage, making&#xD;
Bryan and Coma husband and wife, when they were interrupted&#xD;
by the voice of Kenton and the unexpected appearance of Cap-&#xD;
tam Jean!&#xD;
It would be difficult to say who was the most surprised at&#xD;
this unwelcome meeting---Bryan, Coma,- or the captain; and&#xD;
for a moment each, of them stood eyeing the other in silent con-'&#xD;
fusion, -the Scout during the time greatly enjoying their amaze-&#xD;
..ent.&#xD;
Why this intrusion ?" at length Bryan asked, 1oi&#xD;
at Montlack, and then at Kenton.             on&#xD;
"May the devil take me if I know!" muttered Montlack,&#xD;
sullenly.&#xD;
"Jist go on, Mr. Preacher; it ar' all right," said Simon,&#xD;
still laughing; "this 'tarnal Frenehman fooled me t'other day,&#xD;
and laughed at me; and I'm takin' my revenge! Go ahead!&#xD;
I axed him to the weddin'! He's been parjurin' himself, and&#xD;
doing' us all the harm he wer' able, and I'm now fulfillin' the&#xD;
Scriptuire on him, old chap. You see I'm jist shovellin' hot&#xD;
coals on hishead, by retarnin' good for evil; for, to pay him&#xD;
for all his enmity, I've jist kindly invited him to the wedding ,&#xD;
and as- he didn't like to come, have brought him  an-&#xD;
i fare "heclamedalong ay&#xD;

ta gwith rage, "Ilhave revenge if it takes me a life-&#xD;
time to obtain it!"&#xD;
"Be easy, or you'll hurt your teeth !" said Kenton, with a&#xD;
provoking smile.&#xD;
"Mon Dieu !" groaned Montlack.&#xD;
"Don't be savage, capting," said the Scout, "for I'm jist&#xD;
&#xD;
OR THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.       17&#xD;
&#xD;
gittin' even with you foi that little trick you played me t'other&#xD;
day.. I reckon -I felt a little of the cheapest when I crept&#xD;
round that ar' darned tree backwards, spectin' every moment&#xD;
to hear from you, and found that you were gone. But I guess&#xD;
now you jist feel a drafted sight cheaper, when you find, after&#xD;
alli your lyin', and swearin', and cussed rascality, that Mister&#xD;
Bryan is goin' to marry Miss Coma !"&#xD;
No pen could describe the rage and fury of the baffled and&#xD;
defeated schemer, when he fully discovered the intention of the&#xD;
parties now gathered in the house of Duffe; and Bryan, feel-&#xD;
ing that the harmless revenge of Simon was no nore than a&#xD;
righteous punishment for his treachery, with a smile at the&#xD;
borderer's strange manner of taking satisfaction, ordered the&#xD;
minister to proceed with the ceremony.&#xD;
Amidst the curses and revilingsof the captain, Bryan and&#xD;
Coma were pronounced man and wife; and when the ceremony&#xD;
had been fully completed, Kenton, stepping forward, with a low&#xD;
mocking bow to Montlack, exclaimed-&#xD;
"I guess, capting, he's Head this time ?"&#xD;
"rAnd I swear, by the eternal God, shall yet be Headless!"&#xD;
shouted, Montlack, his countenance distorted with fury and&#xD;
malevolence.&#xD;
Bryan and Coma heard this ominous prophecy of Captain&#xD;
Jean; but thought nothing of it then, for they considered it&#xD;
only a harmless and senseless threat of their disappointed&#xD;
enemy; but in after years this last greeting of her treacherous&#xD;
cousin was brought back sadly""and -horribly to the memory of&#xD;
poor Coma, and the consequences of honest Simon's harmless&#xD;
revenge were bitter and terrible indeed !&#xD;
But~they were married; and their worst foe had been an&#xD;
unwilling witness to their happiness. , They could not, and did&#xD;
not wish him a severer punishment.&#xD;
Prepared for immediate departure, Bryan and Coma, the Ser-&#xD;
geant and his wife, and old Titus and the minister, made no&#xD;
unnecessary delay, but mounting their horses, after a lingering&#xD;
look at' old scenes, turned their faces towards the setting sun.&#xD;

They were gone! Bryan sought a new home in the West;&#xD;
and Coma, trusting in his love, deserted father and home, and&#xD;
followed her husband!&#xD;
There were no steamboats then; and no railroads, not even&#xD;
wagon-tracks, leading west; and where thousands and thousands&#xD;
hurry along now, in carriages, wagons, stages, 'railcars and&#xD;
steamers, all speeding with eager cares or hopes to the great&#xD;
valley of the Mississippi--them, only here and there, and at&#xD;
very rare intervals, would you meet with brave and hardy&#xD;
pioneers, slowly winding their dangerous and toilsome way, on&#xD;
foot, or at best mounted on horseback, to the bloody hunting-&#xD;
grounds of the Indian!&#xD;
The little party, now but started upon their perilous jour-&#xD;
ney, fully knew the danger and hardships they would be com-&#xD;
pelled to undergo ere they reached the beautiful cane lands&#xD;
described by Kenton. Yet,-they had made up their minds to&#xD;
risk and dare all, hoping at last to find a happy home! All&#xD;
their worldly goods were packed on a few led horses; and Co-&#xD;
ma, the child of fortune and luxury, rich in the love of him&#xD;
she had chosen, forgot all the comforts of civilization; while-she-&#xD;
hurried with -a glad smile, and buoyant with glorious hopes,&#xD;
through the sombre forest, to embrace all the privations and&#xD;
perils of a semi-savage land! Hers was a love,'not of sunshine,&#xD;
and plenty, and wealth; but the rich confiding outpourings of&#xD;
an artless, a trusting, and devoted heart. And Bryan felt and&#xD;
fully appreciated the inestimable value of the rich jewel he had&#xD;
gathered. He knew the sacrifice she was making, and with a&#xD;
glistening eye looked proudly upon her graceful person as she&#xD;
rode by his side; vowing, in his own heart, that she should&#xD;
never know sorrow, or. danger, or want, so long as he had a&#xD;
tongue to soothe, a heart to love, or'an arm 'to defend and sup-&#xD;
port.&#xD;
Kenton stood in, the deserted doorway of Duffe's cottage,&#xD;
watching the departure of his friends; and when they were&#xD;
about to glide from his' sight, with a' loud cheer he waved 'them&#xD;
onward to his loved "FKaintuck."  .. ..&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THE SCOUT'S REVENGE.            189&#xD;
The sergeant, drawing rein, returned the borderer's shout&#xD;
with a military touch of the cap;. Coma greeted it with a wave&#xD;
of her snowy hand ; Mrs. Duffe wept in silence; Bryan, rising&#xD;
in his stirrups, took off his hat ; old Titus gave an answering&#xD;
shout; and the minister, with a devout look to heaven, mur-&#xD;
inured-" Amen1"&#xD;
They were gone!&#xD;
*       *      *       *      *       *&#xD;
"I guess, capting," said the Scout, moving from the door,&#xD;
and standing before Montlack, "that was about the beautifulest&#xD;
sight I ever saw. I wish you had seen her, and -how bravely&#xD;
she turns her face west, and how loving she rides by the side&#xD;
of Mister Bryan, and how proud he looks. Blast me if it&#xD;
wouldn't cure sore eyes;just to see 'em !"&#xD;
"She'll be sick enough of her bargain before another year&#xD;
rolls round," sneered Montlack, "and will have but fe sweet&#xD;
words for him that persuaded her to so silly a step. How do&#xD;
you think she'll enjoy the privation of a rough frontier life ?&#xD;
Eh !,Captain Kenton, I guess she won't think .you then as&#xD;
good, and honest, and truthful as you and your. snivelling&#xD;
friend would have her now believe."&#xD;
"Don't trouble yourself 'bout Miss Coma," replied the Scout,&#xD;
eyeing the captain anything but pleasantly; "I guess she'll be&#xD;
happy enough, as much so, at any rate, as if she had remained&#xD;
here with that grand old daddy of her'n ; and your own beau-&#xD;
tiful self. She won't have sich a great house out in. Kain-&#xD;
tuck, and so many servants, and. sich fine furniture, and all&#xD;
sich stuff, but she'll never want venison, and bear-meat, and&#xD;
buffalo so long as Sharp-Eye can raise old Betsy; and blast me&#xD;
if I don't jist make her carpets and beds of furs every bit as&#xD;
costly and comfortable as the cussed stuck-up consarns you've&#xD;
got in this 'ere country."&#xD;
"A very inviting home, indeed," said Montlack, mockingly,&#xD;
for he discovered that Simon was somewhat touchy on this&#xD;
point, and wished to aggravate him as much as possible. "She&#xD;
will be highly delighted, I have no doubt, eating fat bear-meat,&#xD;

&#xD;
and sleeping on greasy bear-skins, and willnever think of linen&#xD;
sheets and feathers again! lHa! ha!'" he laughed; "to what a&#xD;
glorious home your friend will carry his daintily-raised bride!&#xD;
How happy she'll be in her nice log cabin, with the inter&#xD;
ad refined society she will meet there."             g&#xD;
"She'll not be so bad off for comforts as you think," retorted&#xD;
Simon, "for Sally and Mr. Bryan have managed to take with&#xD;
them many of them ar' little woman contraptions you speak&#xD;
on ; and thar's Titus and me who'll fix up all things snug,&#xD;
and .gather flowers, and grapes, and fruits, and make Miss&#xD;
Coma happy enough in her new home. If we ain't so high&#xD;
larnt and refined out thar as you folks in the old country, we&#xD;
are honest and kind, and that ar' a darned sight more than can&#xD;
be said of you. And if the worst comes, and Miss Coma has&#xD;
to sleep on a bear-skin bed," added the bordered with dignity,&#xD;
"she'll not be the first fair damsel that has done it, and.will&#xD;
be happier thar in her log cabin, with the love of an honest&#xD;
and brave man, than she would have been in the big house,&#xD;
with silks and satins, forever parsecuted by sich a- cowardly&#xD;
sneakin':villain as you are."&#xD;
" Oh, no doubt of it," replied Montlack, no little ruffled by&#xD;
the unpolished bluntness of his captor, at the same time&#xD;
{moving uneasily in his seat, for his hands were confined un-&#xD;
comfortably tight, and pained him; "but let her go, and to the&#xD;
devil, for aught I care." '&#xD;
"Don't forgit your education, capting, and that ar' refine-&#xD;
ment you wer' talkin' about just now," said Sim'on, recovering&#xD;
his good-humor with the increasing uneasiness and passion of&#xD;
Montlack.&#xD;
" A thousand devils take you !" exclaimed Montlack,&#xD;
furiously. "fHow long do you intend to keep me here tied in&#xD;
this manner?"&#xD;
"One devil will do," replied Kenton, enjoying Montlack's&#xD;
ill-humor; "and I guess I'll jist keep you till Mister Bryan&#xD;
is beyond all pursuit- then I'll take a lock of your hair to&#xD;
give to your friend Simon Girty for the scalp-lock I intend to&#xD;
&#xD;
SIMtON KENTON;&#xD;
&#xD;
190&#xD;
&#xD;
take from him, and then, with your permission, capting, I'll&#xD;
jist leave you to be hunted out by the general."&#xD;
" You are a devil incarnate," hissed Montlack, (and have&#xD;
it all your own way now; but my time will come, and I'll&#xD;
have revenge."&#xD;
"Don't be a cussin' so, for it ar' wrong, capting ; and be&#xD;
patient, for thar's nothin' like patience," said Simon, philo-&#xD;
sophically. "I wer' once jist like you; had no patience in the&#xD;
world; wer' always breakin' out in a passion, and fightin', and&#xD;
cussin', and doin' all sorts of foolish things; but I got cured at&#xD;
last, and I'll tell you how it wer' fotched about, fof it will help&#xD;
us to pass off the time, and ,may be of some benefit to you,&#xD;
casting. I wer' a young man at the time, and all fire and pas-&#xD;
sion, like most young fellers, and it wer' my first trip West.&#xD;
I got on one of them ar' flatboats at Pittsburgh, and wer' going'&#xD;
down the Ohio River in it; and when I got to my landin'-&#xD;
place, they were sendin' me out in a canoe; and .to push clear&#xD;
of the boat, I jist cotched hold of one of them long sweep&#xD;
oars, lying out in the water, when a wag on board, seeing' I had&#xD;
hold on it, placed his hands on t'other end, and without a word&#xD;
lifted me plump out into the water."&#xD;
"_And I wish. he had left you there," thought Montlack ;&#xD;
but he did not give expression to his thoughts.&#xD;
"I had on my best togs, captings" continued Simon, "and&#xD;
maybe I wer'n't mtd, and cussed, and raved, hang' on ,to&#xD;
that ar' oar up to my neck in water. But it wer'n't no use&#xD;
at all; for the villain, when I wer' about half drowned, jist&#xD;
bore down on the oar agin, and then up he raised me to drip ;&#xD;
and as I wer' in a pertickler bad humor, and continued to cuss&#xD;
and rave, and threaten him, without, more ado he jist let me&#xD;
down in the water agin, and when I sorter cooled off, for it&#xD;
were plaguy cold in January, then he would hoist me up agin&#xD;
to dry. It wer' darned provokin', capting, and no mistake,&#xD;
and tried my patience 'mazin'ly. But no sooner would I drip&#xD;
a little than my patience would give way, and once more I'd&#xD;
commence cussin' and swearin' like mad, and down he'd drop&#xD;
&#xD;

me into the water, and blast me, casting, if he didn't keep up&#xD;
his dipping' and drippin' till I got as cool as a cucumber, had&#xD;
no more spunk than a 'possum, lost my passion altogether, and&#xD;
become as patient as a lamb, and they do say it ar' the most&#xD;
all-fired patient critter livin'. I hain't been the same man&#xD;
since that duckin'; never git into a passion now, and have&#xD;
lots and squares of patience. Cuss me if I wer'n't cured&#xD;
effectually; and I'd recommend you, capting, if you ever go a&#xD;
fatboatin', to jst try the 'speriment. It works like a charm,&#xD;
this cold water cure, both on dogs and men."&#xD;
"I want 'one of your advice," said Montlack, surlily; "but&#xD;
if you have one spark of humanity left in your brutal breast,&#xD;
you will loose this cord from my hands. It is very painful."&#xD;
Not in the least; you must.bemistaken, capting, for I'm&#xD;
jist up to all sich things as that, and with my hands tied as&#xD;
'beautiful as your'n could lay down and sleep like a baby.&#xD;
Why, darn me if the Ingens didn't once keep me a week stretched&#xD;
out at full length upon my back, with my arms bound down to&#xD;
a pole, put under my head for a pillar, and my legs spread out&#xD;
and tied to two saplin's, like a coon-skin put out to dry. I&#xD;
'knowledge it wer' pretty hard at first, but I soon got used to&#xD;
it, and spent my time lookin' up nt the stars, or sleepin' like a&#xD;
turtle on a log. Blame me if it wer'n't rather good for me,&#xD;
for I thought more of heaven then than I ever did afore or&#xD;
since.&#xD;
"My God! you are a fiend thus to torture me !" exclaimed&#xD;
Montlack, with a groan, and struggling to burst his bonds.'&#xD;
"Torture you, capting ? Why, you're jokin'. If the Shawa-&#xD;
nees had you tied to a stake, like they had n'ie once, and wer' to&#xD;
muse themselves throwin' tomahawks at your head, and touchin'&#xD;
you up with burnin' coals, and shootin' arrows into you, thar&#xD;
might be some sense in your talkin' 'bout torture ! But to&#xD;
hear a feller sittin' comfortably in a house, jist 'cause his hands&#xD;
ai't in his lap, 'stead of being' behind his back, talk of torture-&#xD;
it's enough to make a dog laugh ! Ain't- it, Bang ?"&#xD;
Bang showed his teeth, as if highly amused with such an&#xD;
&#xD;
OR, THlE SOOUT'S RJEVENGE.13&#xD;
absurdity; and his master, as if struck with the silliness of&#xD;
Montlack's complaints, laughed outright.&#xD;
Stepping to the door, the Scout looked out a moment on the&#xD;
gathering night, then, a if satisfied with the result of his obser-&#xD;
vation, returned again to the presence of his prisoner, saying-&#xD;
"Well, Mister Montlack, we'll have to part company now!&#xD;
I guess by this time Mr. Bryan is far enough on his way, and&#xD;
nobody will be huntin' you to-night. The gineral thinks&#xD;
Miss Coma at Hillsborough, and, I dare say, 'spects 'you are&#xD;
thar too: so I'll be off, and leave you here to cogitate over&#xD;
your defeated schemes, and to come to' the conclusion 'that&#xD;
honesty ar' the best policy after all."'&#xD;
"You will not leave me-bound in this manner?" said Mont-&#xD;
lack, beseechingly.&#xD;
"Not 'zactly; for I intend to put your feet in the same fix;&#xD;
and then fasten them to that ar' post!S I wouldn't do it, cap-&#xD;
ting," added Kenton, with some appearance of coinmisettion,&#xD;
"but I don't want you to be cousin' the neighborhood, and'&#xD;
common' after us afore we git outer all danger."&#xD;
"Loose my hands, and let.me go, and I swear to you I will&#xD;
alarm no one, and make nopursuit," exclaimed Montlack, at&#xD;
the same time ruefully eyeing the cord Kenton had just taken&#xD;
from his pouch.&#xD;
"Can't trust you, capting; for you've parjured yourself&#xD;
already, and ar' 'bout the darndest liar I ever met with."&#xD;
Finding his captor immovable, Montlack submitted to iis&#xD;
fate; pouring forth, however, a stream of impotent oaths and&#xD;
threats, which the borderer received very quietly, merely re-&#xD;
marking, when about to depart-&#xD;
"To tell the truth, capting, it goes agin my nature' to leave&#xD;
you in this 'ere pickle; and you might go, if my own *safety&#xD;
wer' all that wer' at stake; but as it taint, you'll jist have to&#xD;
take your fate and look for liberation to the gineral. I've no&#xD;
doubt he'll be huntin' after you and Miss Coma, to-morrow.&#xD;

Moutlack groaned with pain and despair, and could not, for&#xD;
the life of him, determine whether the Scout intended this&#xD;
homily for a joke or a sermon.&#xD;
" I'm even with you now, casting," continued Simon, with&#xD;
a slight twinkle of humor about they, "for that ar' little&#xD;

CONTAINING&#xD;
1. A new, full, and complete Concordance;&#xD;
Illustrated with monumental, traditional, and oriental engravings, founded on Butterworth's, with&#xD;
Cruden's definitions; forming, it is believed, on many accounts, a more valuable work than either&#xD;
Butterworth, Cruden, or any other similar book in the language.&#xD;
The value of a Concordance is now generally understood ; and those who have used one, con-&#xD;
sider it indispensable in connection with the Bible.&#xD;
2. A Guide to the Reading ,and Study of the Bible;&#xD;
being Carpenter's valuable Biblical Companion, lately published in London, containing a complete&#xD;
history of the Bible, and forming a most excellent introduction to its study. It embraces the evi-&#xD;
dences of Christianity, Jewish antiquties, manners, customs, arts, natural history, &amp;amp;c., of the Bible,&#xD;
with notes and engravings added.&#xD;
3. Complete       Biographies of Henry, by Williams;i Scotty                          s&#xD;
son; Doddridge, by Orton;&#xD;
with sketches of the lives and characters, and notices of the works, of the writers on the Scriptures&#xD;
who are quoted in the Commentary, living and dead, American and foreign.&#xD;
This pa tf tho:olume not only affords a large quantity of interesting and useful reading for&#xD;
pious families, but ill also be a source of gratification to all those who are in the habit of consult-&#xD;
ing the Commentary ;every one naturally feeling a desire to know some particulars of the lives and&#xD;
characters of those whose opinions he seeks. Appended to this part, will be a&#xD;
BIBLIOTHECA BIBLICA,&#xD;
or list of the best works on the Bible, of all kinds, arranged under their appropriate heads.&#xD;
4. A complete Index of the Matter contained in the Bible Text.&#xD;
5. A Symbolical Dictionary.&#xD;
A very comprehensive and valuable Dictionary of Scripture Symbols, (occupying about Afty-niz&#xD;

Daubuz, Lancaster,'Hutcheson, &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
6. A The Work contains. several other Articles,&#xD;
Indexes, Tables, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c., and is,&#xD;
7. Illustrated by a large Plan of Jerusalem,&#xD;

London, architect. Also, two steel engravings of portraits of seven foreign;and eight American&#xD;
theological writers, and numerous wood engravings.&#xD;
The whole forms a desirable and necessary fund of instruction for the use not only of clergymen&#xD;
and Sabbath-school teachers, but also for families. When the great amount of matter it must&#xD;
contain is considered, it will be deemed exceedingly cheap.&#xD;
" I have examined ' The Companion to the Bibl' adhave been surprised to find so much inform-&#xD;
ation introduced into a volume of so moderate a size. It contains a library of sacred knowledge&#xD;
and criticism. It will be useful to ministers who own large librariesaRY cano fai tobea&#xD;

ROBERTS, HARiVER, MURDER, PAXTON, CHANDLER,&#xD;
And the most celebrated oriental travellers. Embracing also the subject of the Fulfilment of&#xD;

ILLUSTRATED BY NUMEROUS LANDSCAPE ENGRAVINGS,&#xD;
FROM. 8 KETCHES TAKEN ON THE SPOT,&#xD;
Edited by Rev. GEORGE BUSH&#xD;
Professor of Hebrew and Oriental Literature in the New York City University.&#xD;
The importance of this work must be obvious, and, being altogether illustrate, without reference&#xD;
to doctrines, or other points in which Christians differ, it is hoped it will meet with favour from all&#xD;
who love the sacred volume, and that it will be sufficiently interesting and attractive to recommend&#xD;
tselfnot only-to professed Christians of all denominations, but also to the general reader. The&#xD;
arrangement of the texts illustrated with the notes, in the order of the chapters and verses of the&#xD;
authorized v ion of the Bible,; will render it convenient for reference to particular passages;&#xD;
while the cpio  ier at the end will at once enable the reader to turn to every subject discussed&#xD;
in the volume. n&#xD;
This volume is not designed to fake the place of Commentaries, but is a distinct department of biblical&#xD;
instructon, and mae be used as a companion to the Comprehensive or any other .Commentary, or the&#xD;

THE ENGRAVINGS&#xD;
In this volume, it is believed, will form no small part of its attractions. No pains have been&#xD;
to procure such as should embellish the work, and, at the same time, illustrate the text. Obec-&#xD;
tions that have been made to the pictures commonly introduced into the Bibl, as being mete crea-&#xD;
tions of fancy and the imagination, often unlike nature, andfrequentlycoveing false impressions,&#xD;
cannot-be urged against the pictorial illustrations of this volume. Here ;the fine arts are made&#xD;
subservient to utility, the landscape views being, without an exception, matter-of-fact views of places&#xD;
mentioned in Scripture, as they appear at the present day; thus in many instances exhibiting, in the&#xD;
most forcible manner, to the eye, the strict and literal fulfilment of the remarkable prophecies ; " the&#xD;
. present ruined and desolate coditio of the cities of Babylon, Nineveh, Sela, &amp;amp;c., and the coun-&#xD;
tries of Edom and Egypt, are astonishing examples, and so completely exemplify, in the most&#xD;
minute particulars, every thing which was foretold of them in the height of their prosperity, that&#xD;
no better description can now be given of them than a simple quotation from a chapter and verse&#xD;
of the Bible written nearly two or three thousand years ago." The publishers are enabled to select&#xD;
fromseveral collections lately published in London, the proprietor of one of which says thatk"sew.&#xD;

of Scripture places, made upon the spot, " The land of Palestine, it is well known, abounds in&#xD;
scenes of the most pictaresgue beauty. Syria comprehends the snowy heights of Lebanon, and the&#xD;

LIPPINCOTT'S EDITION OF&#xD;
BABSTER'S. COMPREHE                                  SIVE BIBLE.&#xD;
In order to develope the peculiar nature of the Comprehensive Bible, it will only be necessary&#xD;
to embrace its more prominent features.&#xD;
1st. The SACRED' TEXT is that of the Authorized Version, and is printed from the edition cor-&#xD;
rected and improved by Dr. Blaney, which, from its accuracy, is considered the standard edition.&#xD;
2d. The VARIOUS READINGS are faithfully printed from the edition of Dr. Blaney, inclusive&#xD;
of the translation of the proper names, without the addition or diminution of one.&#xD;
3d. In the CHRONOLOGY, great care has been taken to fix the date of the particular transao-&#xD;
tions, which has seldom been done with any degree of exactness in any former edition of the Bible.&#xD;
4th. The NOTES are exclusively philological and explanatory, and are not tinctured with senti-&#xD;
ments of any sect or party. They are selected from the most eminent Biblical critics and com-&#xD;
mentators.&#xD;
It is hoped that this edition of the Holy Bible will be found to contain the essence of Biblical&#xD;
research and criticism, that lies dispersed through an immense number of volumes.&#xD;
Such is the nature and design of this edition of the Sacred Volume, which, from the various&#xD;
objects it embraces, the freedom of its pages from all sectarian peculiarities, and the beauty, plain-&#xD;
ness, and correctness of the typography, that it cannot fail of proving acceptable and useful to&#xD;
Christians of every denomination.&#xD;
In addition to the usual references to parallel passages, which are quite full and numerous, the&#xD;
student has all the marginal-readings, together with a rich selection of Philological, Critical, Histo-&#xD;
rical, Geographical, and other valuable notes and remarks, which explain and illustrate the- sacred&#xD;
text. Besides the general introduction, containing valuable essays on the genuineness, authenticity,&#xD;
and inspiration of the Holy Scriptures, and other topics of interest, there are introductory and con-&#xD;
cluding remarks to each book-a table of the contents of the Bible, by which the different portions&#xD;
are so arranged as to read in an historical order.&#xD;
Arranged at the top of each page is the period in which the prominent events of sacred history&#xD;
took place. The calculations are made for the year of the world before and after Christ, Julian&#xD;
Period, the year of the Olympiad, the year of the building of Rome, and other notations of time.&#xD;
At the close is inserted a Chronological Index of the Bible, according to the computation of Arch-&#xD;
bishop Ussher. Als, a full and valuable index of the subjects contained in the Old and New Testa-&#xD;
ments, with a careful analysis and arrangement of texts under their appropriate subjects.&#xD;
Mr. Greenfield, the editor'of this work, and for some time previous to his death the superintend-&#xD;
ent of the editorial department of the British and Foreign Bible Society, was a most extraordinary&#xD;
man. In editing the Comprehensive Bible, his varied and extensive learning was called into suc-&#xD;
cessful exercise, and appears in happy combination with tincera piety and a sound judgment. The&#xD;
Editor of the Christian Observer, alluding to this work, in an obituary notice of its author, speaks&#xD;
of it as a work of "prodigious labour and research, at once exhibiting his varied talents and pro-&#xD;
found erudition."&#xD;
LIPPINCOTT'S EDITION OF&#xD;
THE OXFORD QUA RTO BIBLE,&#xD;
The Publishers have spared neither care nor expense in their edition of the Bible; it is printed&#xD;
en the finest white vellum paper, with large and beautiful type, and bound in the most substantial&#xD;
and splendid manner, in the following styles: Velvet, with richly gilt ornaments; Turkey super&#xD;
extra, with gilt clasps; and in numerous others, to suit the taste of the most fastidious.&#xD;
OPINIONS OF TH E PRESS..&#xD;
'in our opinion, the Christian public generally will feel under great obhligations to the publishers&#xD;
of this work for the beautiful taste, arrangement, and delicate neatness with which they have got&#xD;
it out. The intrinsic merit of the Bible recommends itself; it needs no tinsel ornament to adorn&#xD;
its sacred pages. In this edition every superfluous ornament has been avoided and we have pre-&#xD;
seated us a prfectly chaste specimen of the Bible, without note or comment. it appears to be just&#xD;
what is needed in every famil-'the unsophisticated word of God.'&#xD;
" The size is quarto, printed with beautiful type, on white, sized vellum paper, of the finest texture,&#xD;
and most beautiful surface. The publishers seem to have been solicitous to make a perfectly&#xD;
unique book, and they have accomplished the object very successfully. We trust that a liberal&#xD;
community will afford them ample remuneration for all the expense and outlay they have necessary&amp;amp;&#xD;
rily incurred in its publication. It is a standard Bible.&#xD;
" The ublishers are Messrs. Lippincott, Grambo &amp;amp; Co., No.14 North Fourth street, PhdladeL-&#xD;
phia."-- Bast Record.&#xD;
"A beautiful quarto edition of the Bible, by L., G. &amp;amp; Co. Nothing can exceed the typ in clear&#xD;
ness and beauty ; the paper is of the finest texture, and the whole execution is exceedingy neat.,&#xD;
No illustrations or ornamental type are used. Those who prefer a Bible executed in perfect sim-&#xD;
plicity, yetoelegance of style, without adornment, will probably never find one more to their taste "&#xD;

The Errors of Moderni Infidelity Illustrated and Refuted.&#xD;

In one volu~be, 12Ino.; cloth. Just published.&#xD;
We cannot but regard this work in whatever light we view it in reference to its design, as one&#xD;
of the most inasterly productions f±' the age, and fitted to uproot one of the most fondly cherished&#xD;
and dangerous of all ancient or m dern errors. God must bless such a work, armed with his ow&#xD;
truth, and doing fierce and successful battle against black infidelity, which would bring Is Mast&#xD;
and Wotrd down to the tribunal of human reason, for condemnation and annihilation.-Alb. Spectator&#xD;

FROM THE LAST LONDON EDITION, COMPLETE.&#xD;
One volume, beautifully illustrated with °Steel Plates, and the only readable edition&#xD;
published in this country.&#xD;
As a matter of course, every family in our country has a copy of the Holy Bible; and as the pre-&#xD;
sumption is that the greater portion often consult its pages, we take the liberty of saying to all those&#xD;
that do, that the perusal of the writings of Josephua will be found very interesting and instructive.&#xD;
All those who wish to possess a beautiful and correct copy of this valuable work, would do well&#xD;
to purchase this edition. It is for sale at all the principal bookstores in the United States, and by&#xD;

To which is added to each Sermon, a Short Prayer, with some General Prayers for Families,&#xD;

These sermons, which are characterized by a beautiful simplicity, the entire absence of contro-&#xD;
versy, and a true evangelical spirit, have gone through many and large editions, and been translated&#xD;
into several of the continental languages. " They have also been the honoured means not only of&#xD;
converting many individuals, but also of introducing the Gospel into districts, and even into parish&#xD;
churches, where before it was comparatively unknown."&#xD;
" This work fully deserves the immortality it has attained."&#xD;
This is a fine library edition of this invaluable work ; and when we say that it should be found in&#xD;
the possession of every family, we only reiterate the sentiments and sincere wishes of all who take&#xD;
a deep interest inhe eternal welfare of mankind.&#xD;

BYRON'S WORKS.&#xD;
COMPLETE IN ONE VOLUME, OCTAVO.&#xD;
INCLUDING ALL HIS SUPPRESSED AND ATTRIBUTED POEMS; WITH SIX BEAUTIFUL&#xD;
ENGRAVINGS.&#xD;
This edition has been carefully compared with the recent London edition of Mr. Murray, and&#xD;
made complete by the addition of more than fifty pages of poems heretofore unpublished in Eng-&#xD;
land. Among these there are a number that have never appeared in any American edition; and&#xD;
the publishers believe they are warranted in saying that this is the most complete edition of Lord&#xD;
Byron's Poetical Works ever published in the United States.&#xD;
Sifh~uIf                                 5n&#xD;
Complete in one volume, octavo ; with seven beautiful Engravings.&#xD;
This is a new and complete edition, with a splendid engraved likeness of Mrs. Hemans, on steel,&#xD;
and contains all the Poems in the last London and American editions. With a Critical Preface by&#xD;
Mr. Thatcher, of Boston.&#xD;
"As no work in the English language can be commended with more confidence, it will argue bad&#xD;
taste in a female in this country to be without a complete edition of the writings of one who was&#xD;
an honour to her sex anil to humanity, and whose productions, from first to last, contain no syllable&#xD;
calculated to call a blush to the cheek of modesty and virtue. There is, moreover, in Mrs. Hemans's&#xD;
poetry, a moral purity and a religious feeling which commend it, in an especial manner, to the dis-&#xD;
criminating reader. No parent or guardian will be under the necessitysof imposing restrictions&#xD;
with regard to the free perusal of every production emanating from this gifted woman. There&#xD;
breathes throughout the whole a most eminent exemption from impropriety of thought or diction;&#xD;
and there is at times a pensiveness of tone, a winning sadness in her more serious compositions,&#xD;
which tells of a soul which has been lifted from the contemplation of terrestrial things, to divine&#xD;
sommuninga with beings of a purer world."&#xD;

The distinguished Professor Silliman, speaking of this edition, observes: "I am as much gratified&#xD;
by the elegance and fine taste of your edition, as by the noble tribute of genius and moral excel-&#xD;
lenetswhich these delightful authors have left for all future generationss; and Cowper, espasially,&#xD;
is not less conspicuous as a true Christian, moralist and teacher, than as a poet of great power and&#xD;
exquisite taste."&#xD;

The beauty, correctness, and convenience of this favourite edition of these standard authors are&#xD;
so well known, that it is scarcely necessary to add a word in its favour. It is onlynecessary to say,&#xD;
that the publishers have now issued an illustrated edition, which greatly enhances its former value.&#xD;

A writer in the Boston Traveller holds the following language with reference to these valuable&#xD;
editions:-&#xD;
" Mr. Editor: -I wish, without any idea of puffing, to say a word or two upon the ' Library of&#xD;
English Poets' that is now published at Philadelphia, by Lippincott, Grambo &amp;amp; Co. It is certainly,&#xD;
taking into consideration the elegant manner in which it is printed, and the reasonable price at&#xD;
which it is afforded to purchasers, the best edition of the modern British Poets that has ever been&#xD;
published in this country. Each volume is an octavo of about 500 pages, double columns, stereo-'&#xD;
typed, and accompanied with fine -engravings and biographical sketches; and most of them are&#xD;
reprinted frotm Galignani's French edition.. As to its value, we need only mention that it contains&#xD;
the entire works of Montgomery, Gray, Beattie, Collins, Byron, Cowper, Thomson, Milton, Young,&#xD;
Rogers, Campbell, Lamb, Hemans, Heber, Kirke White, Crabbe, the Miscellaneous Works of Gold-&#xD;
smith, and other masters of the lyre. The publishers are doing a great service by their publication,&#xD;
and their olumes are almost in as great demand as the fashionable novels of the day ; and they&#xD;
deserve to be so: for they are certainly printed in a style superior to that in which we have before&#xD;
had the works of the English Poets."&#xD;
No library can be considered complete without a copy of the above beautiful and cheap editions&#xD;
of the English Poets; and persons ordering all or any of them, will please say Lippincott, Grambo&#xD;

habits of mind, and her long occupation with literature, has given her peculiar facilities; and tho-&#xD;
roughly has she accomplished her task in the work before us."- Sarlain's Magazine.&#xD;
"It is a choice collection of poetical extracts from ever English and American author worth&#xD;

The type of this edition is so perfect, and it is printed with so much care, on fine white paper,&#xD;
that it can be read with as much ease as most of the larger editions. This work is to be had in&#xD;
plain- and superb binding, making a beautiful volume for a gift.&#xD;
" The Poetical Works of Lord Byron, complete in one volume - published by L., G. &amp;amp; Co., Phila-&#xD;
delphia. We hazard nothing in saying that, take it altogether, tius is the most elegant work ever&#xD;
issued from the American press.&#xD;
"'In a single volume, not larger than an ordinary duodecimo, the publishers have embraced the&#xD;
whole ofLord Byrou's Poems, usually printed in ten or twelve volumes; and, what is more remark-&#xD;
able, have done it with a type so clear afid distinct, that, notwithstanding its necessarily small size,&#xD;
it may be read with the utmost facility, even by failing eyes. The book is stereotyped ; and never&#xD;
have we seen a finer specimen of that art. Everything about it is perfect-the paper, the print-&#xD;
ing, the binding, all correspond with each other ; and it is embellished with two fine engravings,&#xD;
well worthy the companionship in which they are placed.&#xD;
"'This will make a beautiful Christmas present.&#xD;
"We extract the above from Godey's Lady'sfBook. The notice itself, we are given to understand.&#xD;
is written by Mrs. Hale.&#xD;
" We have to add our commendation in favour of this beautiful volume, a copy of which has&#xD;
been sent us by the publishers. The admirers of the noble bard will feel obliged to the enterprise&#xD;
which has prompted the publishers to dare a competition with the numerous editions of his works&#xD;
already incirculation- and we shall be surprised if this convenient travelling edition does not in a&#xD;
great degree supersede the use of-the large octavo works, which have little advantage in size and&#xD;

rogether with a copious Collection of Law Maxims and Law Terms, translated into&#xD;

NEW AMERICAN EDITION CORRECTED, WITH ADDITIONS.&#xD;
One volume, l2mo.&#xD;
This volumetcomprises a copious collection of legal and other terms which are in common sue&#xD;
wth English translations and historical illustrations ; and we should judge its authorhuly&#xD;
ten to a great "Feast of Languages," and stole all the scraps. A work of thischaracter invold&#xD;
have an extensive sale, as it entirely obviates a serious difficulty in which most re   are inr olved&#xD;
by the frequent occurrence of Latin, Greek, and French passages, which we ~euppose are introduced&#xD;
by authors for a mere show of learning-a difficulty very perplexing to readers in genereetual  1&#xD;
" Dictionary of Quotations," concerning which too much cannot be said i r  fvbeh e  tally&#xD;
removes the difficulty, and gives the reader an advantage over the author; for we believe a majority&#xD;
are themselves ignorant of the meaning of the terms they employ. Very few truly learnedauhr&#xD;
will insult their readers by introducing Latin or French quotations in their writings, when "plain&#xD;
English" will do as well; but we will not enlarge on this point.&#xD;
If the book is useful to those unacquainted with other languages, it is no less valuable to the&#xD;
classically educated as a book of reference, and answers all the purposes of a Lexicon - indeed, on&#xD;
many accounts, it is better. It saves the trouble of tumbling over the larger volumes, to which&#xD;
every one, and especially those engaged in the legal profession, are very often subjected. It should&#xD;
have a place in every library in the country.&#xD;

A ROMANCE OF KENTUCKY.&#xD;
FOUNDED ON FACTS.&#xD;
BY JAMES WEIR, ESQ.&#xD;
IN TWO VOLUMES.&#xD;
The scenes, characters, and incidents in these volumes have been copied from nature, and from&#xD;
Veal life. They are represented as taking place at that period in the history of Kentucky, when&#xD;
the Indian, driven, after many a hard-fought field, from his favourite hunting-ground, was succeeded&#xD;
by a rude and unlettered population, interspersed with organized bands of desperadoes, scarcely&#xD;
less savage than the red men they had displaced. The author possesses a vigorous and graphic&#xD;
pen, and has produced a very interesting romance, which gives us a striking portrait of the times&#xD;
he describes.&#xD;

Also, Prize Essays, Statistics, Miscellanies, and numerous private letters from successful and&#xD;
distinguished business men.&#xD;
12mo., cloth. Price One Dollar.&#xD;
The object of this treatise is fourfold. First, the elevation of the business character, and to define&#xD;
clearly the limits wit bin which it is not only proper but obligatory to get money. Secondly, to lay&#xD;
down the principles which must be observed to insure success, and what must be avoided to escape&#xD;
failure. Thirdly, to give the mode of management in certain prominent pursuits adopted by the&#xD;
most successful, from which men in all kinds of business may derive profitable hints. Fourthly, to&#xD;
afford a work of solid interest to those who read without expectation of pecuniary benefit.&#xD;

BY JAMES HAMILTON-.&#xD;
'th work is compiled from his original journals and correspondence, and includes an account of&#xD;
his services in the American Revolution, and in the war between the Russians and Turks in the&#xD;
Black Sea. There is scarcely any Naval Hero, of any age, who combined in his character so much&#xD;
of the adventurous, skilful and daring, as Paul Jones. The incidents of his life are almost as start&#xD;
ling and absorbing as those of romance. His achievements during the American Revolution-the&#xD;
fight between the Bon Homme Richard and Serapis, the most desperate naval action on record-&#xD;
and the alarm into which, with so small a force, he threw the coasts of England and Scotland-are&#xD;
matters comparatively well known to Americans; but the incidents of his subsequent career have&#xD;
been veiled in obscurity, which is dissipated by this biography. A book like this, narrating the&#xD;
actions of such a man, ought to meet with an extensive sale, and become as popular as Robinson&#xD;
Crusoe in fiction, or Weems's Life of Marion and Washington, and similar books, in fact. It con-&#xD;
tais 400 pages, has a handsome portrait and medallion likeness of Jones, and is illustrated with&#xD;
umefous original wood engravings of naval scenes and distinguished men with whom he was&#xD;
familiar.&#xD;

LlPPINCOTT'S CABINET HISTORIES OF THE STATES,&#xD;
CONSISTING OF A SERIES OF&#xD;
Cabinet Histories of all the States of the Union,&#xD;
TO EMBRACE A VOLUME FOR EACH STATE.&#xD;
We have so far completed all our arrangements, as to be able to issue the whole series in the&#xD;
shortest possible time consistent with its careful literary production. SEVERAL VOLUMES ARE&#xD;
NOW READY FOR SALE. The talented authors who have engaged to write these Histories, are&#xD;
no strangers in the literary world.&#xD;
NOTICES OF THE PRESS.&#xD;
"These most tastefully printed and bound volumes form the first instalment of a series of State&#xD;
Histories, which, without superseding the bulkier and more expensive works of the same cha&#xD;
ter, may enter household channels from which the others would be excluded by their cost and&#xD;
magnitude."&#xD;
In conciseness, clearness, skill of arrangement, and graphic interest, they are a most excellent&#xD;
earnest of those to come. They are eminently adapted both to interest and instruct, and should&#xD;
nave a place in the family library of every American."-N. Y. Courier and Enquirey.&#xD;
"The importance of a series of State History like those now in preparation, can scarcely be esi&#xD;
mated. Being condensed as carefully as accuracy and interest of narrative will permit, the size&#xD;
and price of the volumes will bring them within the reach of every family in the country, thus&#xD;
maki them home-reding books for old and young. Each individual will, in consequence, become&#xD;
familiar, not only with the history of his own State, but with that of the other States; thus mutual&#xD;
interests will be re-awakened, and old bonds cemented in a firmer re-union."" omesGazette.&#xD;
NEW THEMES FOR THE PROTESTANT CLERGY;&#xD;
CREEDS WITHOUT CHARITY, THEOLOGY WITHOUT HUMANITY, AND PROTESTANT-&#xD;
ISM WITHOUT CHRISTIANITY:&#xD;
With        by the Editor on the Literature of Charity, Population, Pauperism, Political&#xD;
Economy, and Protestantism.&#xD;
"The great question which the book discusses is, whether the Church of this age is what the&#xD;
primitive Church was, and whether Christians-both pastors and people-are doing their duty. Our&#xD;
anthor believes not, and, to our mind, he has made out a strong case. He thinks there is abundant&#xD;
noon for reform at the present time, and that it is needed almost as much as in the days of Luther.&#xD;
And why  Because, in his own words,' While one portion of nominal Christians have busied&#xD;
themselves with forms and ceremonies and observances; with pictures, images, and processions;&#xD;
othershave given to doctrines the supremacy, and have busied themselves in laying down the&#xD;
lies whin to enforce human belief-lines of interpretation by which to control human opinion&#xD;
-lines of discipline and restraint, by which to bring human minds to uniformity of faith and actn.&#xD;
They have formed creeds and catechisms; they have spread themselves over the whole field of the&#xD;
sacred writings, and scratched up all the surface ; they have gathered all the straws, and turned&#xD;
over all the pebbles, and detected the colour and determined the outline of every stone and tree&#xD;
and shrub ; they have dwelt with rapture upon all that was beautiful and sublime;, but they have&#xD;
trampled over mines of golden wisdom, of surpassing richnessand depth, almost without a thought,&#xD;
andalmost without an effort to fathom these priceless treasures, much lessto take possession&#xD;
of them.'-PRICE, ONE DOLLAR.&#xD;
