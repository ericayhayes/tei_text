p&#xD;
This book may be regarded as one of the varieties of the day. It is difficult to&#xD;
canceive, while perusing these Lamnbleswtere adventures so excititig and thrilling&#xD;
are so forcibly told, that it is a true and veritable narrative; but such,we assure the&#xD;
reader is the fact. The natural scenery in that sunny region is painted in the glow.&#xD;
ing tints of a faithfut picture. The character of that singular people, the Arauenni.&#xD;
ans; the lofty and magnanimous bearing of their warriors; the lovely. confiding,&#xD;
and affectionate dispositions of the rimaidenus, arc all beautifully delineated; and so&#xD;
vididly are the various scenes portrayed, that we s een to be transported to the field&#xD;
where they are etacte.l, and feel; the varied emotions of the actors. If some of&#xD;
these adventures and incidents, were related in a romance, the leader would prob.&#xD;
ably say they were exaggerated, so much mre strange is truth than fiction.&#xD;

ADVERTISEMENT.&#xD;
The following Narrative was originally written without the least idea of publi-&#xD;
cation, for the Author's own amusement-a mere whim of the hour, "to perpetu-&#xD;
ate the remembrance of the thing," while it was fresh upon his mind; and ,to&#xD;
drive away ennui while a sailor on board the Chilian Brig of War "Achilles."&#xD;
At the solicitation of a few friends, it has recently been re-written in portions&#xD;
each week for the "Lincoln Miscellany." The task has been performed at such&#xD;
intervals as-the writer could spare fr'rm his daily labors, when his mind was har-&#xD;
assed with business matters :--le was, therefore, no less surprised than gratified,&#xD;
at the the indulgence and favor with which his hasty production was received&#xD;
during the course otf its pub ication in the "Miscellany." These pages have been&#xD;
printed in signatures weekly, just as they appeared in the paper, and if they are&#xD;
faulty. so be it.; the reader must supply the corrections, he being the only one who&#xD;
has had an opportunity to do so.&#xD;
These remarks are not presented to excuse errors, or avert criticism ; the writer&#xD;
is aware that he must bear the blame of the former, let him be guilty or not guil-&#xD;
ty; and he is quite willing to "bide the pelting storm" of the latter; his sole ob-&#xD;
ject having been-without any attempt at author-craft-to furnish those who re-&#xD;
quested, and others who may choose to read these "Rambles," a "plain, unvar-&#xD;
nished tale" of a sailor's adventures.&#xD;

OPINIONS OF THE PRESS.&#xD;
"7 The Lincoln (Thomaston, Me,) Miscellany is Publishing an original and&#xD;
highly interesting work entitled "Rambles in Chili,and hfe among the Araucanian&#xD;
Indians," by an annonyrnous author. * *  *  We can heartly pronounce it a&#xD;
work of rare merit. It combines richness of description, with thrilling incidents&#xD;
and marvellous adventures; and abounds in well painted delineations of manners&#xD;
and customs, useful observations of society, and accurate geographical history.&#xD;
The unobtrusive interblendingof a racy humor with the general flow of the narra-&#xD;
tive, will give it a popularity but little inferior to "Melville's Typee." The Aran.&#xD;
canians are an independent race of Indians, inhabiting the southern part of Chili,&#xD;
whom the Spaniards have never yet conquered ; and any account ot them cannot&#xD;
fail of being highly interesting. The work is likely to be widely read.&#xD;
[Norfolk County Journal&#xD;
It is put forward as an authentic narrative, and many of the scenes appear too&#xD;
natural and life like to be an invention of the author. The very minuteness and&#xD;
novelty of the details-preserve it from the charge of being an imaginary work.&#xD;
It is, however, a striking proof of the fact that truth is stranger than fiction, being&#xD;
full of stirring adventures, vivid scenes. and hair breadth escapes.&#xD;
The writer has given a very spirited deseiption' of the country through which&#xD;
he fravelled, and his pen has lent to some of the scenes and things portrayed an&#xD;
indescribable charm. He appears desirous to remain incognito, and uses a ficti-&#xD;
tious cognomen. Upon the whole it is a book well worth reading, which in this&#xD;
age of literary inundation, is saving uch in its favor.  [Weekly Mirror.&#xD;
It is a highly entertaining and instructive tale, giving a true and humorous de.&#xD;
lineation of the manners and custants of the Chilians ; a correct description of&#xD;
the scenery in and about the cities of Valparaiso and Talcahuano ; with a novel&#xD;
and interesting account of a three months sojourn 4rnong a nation of Idians, to.&#xD;
tally ignorant of any previous intercourse with white men.&#xD;
It opens with a sketch of sea life. The principal part of the work, however,&#xD;
is a true narrative of an actttl journey through the count'rv, by two fugitive sail-&#xD;
ors ; and the story of their adventures, reckless daring, and hair breadth escapes&#xD;
is another proof that "truth is stranger than fiction."  Although with little pre'&#xD;
tension to author-craft, the narrative is embellished with some of the most excit-&#xD;
ing and romantic scenes imaginable, and again with others the most comical. It&#xD;
is full of marvellous adventures, perilous journeyings, and glowing pictures of sce-&#xD;
nery and luxuriant nature.                               [Miscellany.&#xD;
We have heard many commendations of it, as abounding in variety of incidents,&#xD;
d natural and lively description.                [Lime Rock Gazette.&#xD;

In this instance the officer is on the alert&#xD;
He has been promenading the starboard&#xD;
side of the quarter deck, looking first on&#xD;
one side, then on the other, or occasional-&#xD;
ly wetting his finger with his mouth, and&#xD;
holding it up to ascertain if any air is stir-&#xD;
ing, until he finally 'imagines a slight&#xD;
agitation of the atmospheric particles.&#xD;
Convincing himself of this fact, he gives&#xD;
the helmsman a poke which disturbs his,&#xD;
reverie, and callfhim back to his post, or&#xD;
rather to his tiller.&#xD;
"Haul in your starboard' braces!" he&#xD;
calls out to the men, who jump up al-&#xD;

covering themselves, the yards are braced&#xD;

he again inquired.&#xD;
I informed him that I had put some&#xD;

that it would answer for some time yet.&#xD;
"Keep her off then, two points.&#xD;

whenever we heard the approach of&#xD;
horses along the road, we turned aside&#xD;
itgo the bushes while they passed. We&#xD;
were at last however suddenly surprised,&#xD;

caught. About noon, uirhile walking-on'in&#xD;
earnest conversation, we saw three horse,&#xD;

a mile ahead, and in full view ; we saw&#xD;
at once that it would be our best course&#xD;
to keep boldly on, as our dodging now,&#xD;
would be -sure to draw their attehtion,&#xD;
and excite suspicion.&#xD;
Upon their near a pproach, we :discover.&#xD;

men, however, appeared to be rather in-&#xD;
diffBrent as to who or what we were and&#xD;
soon they all rode on and 'left us with our&#xD;
hearts beating less violently. After this&#xD;
adventure, for fear of' its rgpetitiorn, we&#xD;
determined to-secrete ofselves for there-&#xD;

Take our politicians and public men&#xD;
generally, and it Will be ,;fou-nd they are&#xD;
ilze:wost craven, dastardly wretches in ex-&#xD;
istence. Look for instance 4 the drivel-&#xD;
ling imbecile, who bore the title of Mayor&#xD;
of New York, and presided over the out..&#xD;
rageoum and co hardly massacre at the&#xD;
4stpy-place opera house, on the;night ,of&#xD;

instead of yielding to the wishes of a disc&#xD;

closing thecontemptible show shop. What&#xD;
A lack of filmnss and independence was&#xD;
hg4iglayd, At the bid of a few bol-&#xD;
l9.  h.aated gristocrats, to order ade=&#xD;

slaughtered, in the vain hope that a want&#xD;
during mountebank vagabond would be&#xD;
permitted to make a harlequin of him-&#xD;
self, and abuse American citizens. What&#xD;
makes the butchery still more melancholy,&#xD;
is the fact, that the least worthy of the&#xD;
fifty murdered persons, was worth more&#xD;
to society, than a whole nationof such as&#xD;
encouraged and rejoiced in the massa-,&#xD;
cre.&#xD;
There are other public functionaries&#xD;
that have proved themselves as craven in&#xD;
their acts, as' has Mayor Woodhull; but&#xD;
few deeds however, have been followed&#xD;
by such dangerous results. A war of&#xD;

the growth and decay of centuries, lay&#xD;
prostrated and scattered along the rough&#xD;
path, a track which seemed marked out&#xD;
by the wild animals that frequented&#xD;
these solitary wilds, rather than by the&#xD;

It was, I think, the fourth day of our&#xD;
journey that we arrived at quite a flour.&#xD;
ishing little village-in fact it was more&#xD;
entitled to the name than any other on the&#xD;
route. We were accosted a short dis-&#xD;
tance out of the village by a man on&#xD;
horse-back. He appeared to be much&#xD;
pleased, saluting us with true Castilian&#xD;
politeness, and inviting us to pass the&#xD;
night with him at his house in the vil-&#xD;
lage. " Entres mi casa paisanos, tomar&#xD;
siesta, si todas a noches, muchos hay pon-&#xD;
chos," cried he with a bow. Si Signor&#xD;
con mucha gusta, mil gracias," replied&#xD;
Harry, as he gladly accepted the invita-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
We were kindly welcomed by the farn-&#xD;
ily of the proprietor, and treated to some&#xD;
fine flavored native wine.  Nearly all&#xD;
the huts of the village were built of reeds&#xD;
plastered with mud, and thatched with&#xD;
straw. Few of them .contained more&#xD;
than one room, and those generallyrWith.&#xD;
out a floor. Here the inmates sit, sleep;&#xD;
and work in wig wamlife,- seldom look=&#xD;
ing beyond their pesent, wants. Their&#xD;
industry ebbs and flows, as plenty or po-&#xD;
erty prevail. We -were treated with&#xD;
great respect by the kind hearted villa-&#xD;
gers. We attended a dance Clled the&#xD;
&amp;amp;macusca, the Ibllowing eve g; and&#xD;
here we were tully initiated into the man-&#xD;
ners and customs of the place.&#xD;
The females in general, are robust and&#xD;
healthy; owing in a great nepasure to their&#xD;
diet of coarse bread and fruit. They 'are&#xD;
extremely fond of dancing, and- seer, to&#xD;
th*w all their energies into the business.&#xD;
The dance which they most prefer is this&#xD;
called the amacusca, somewhat rese n-&#xD;

up our bundles and pushed on from this&#xD;
dangerous neighborhood as fast as our&#xD;

dent that the Spaniard had calculated&#xD;
his chances, presuming that if he could&#xD;
suddenly kill Harry, who was a large&#xD;
aiad muscular man, he could with ease&#xD;
manage so light a person as I was; yet I&#xD;
felt t the time, when my nerves were&#xD;
stung by the excitement, that I could&#xD;
hive easily mastered two such as him;&#xD;
and I have no doubt I could, as my&#xD;
strength was always greater, and my&#xD;
muaseles quickly nerved up during the&#xD;
first moments of excitement, enablingme&#xD;
alwrysj n a rough and tumble scuffle on&#xD;

weight and size. In fact my greatest&#xD;
conceit at that time, ran in the direction&#xD;
&#xD;
along the rout. We passed several tar&#xD;
houses, wit out presuming to gain an in1&#xD;
troduction, until Towards evening when&#xD;
arriving near a small building around&#xD;
which we saw several children at play&#xD;
we ventured to try our success once&#xD;
more. We were however, uncerimoni"&#xD;
ously repulsed ; they turned loose upon&#xD;
us two large dogs, from which we were&#xD;
glad to make a hasty retreat, after having&#xD;
been handled by them in no ceremoni-&#xD;
cus manner.&#xD;
From all these symptoms we judged&#xD;
that our lot had been cast amongst a bar.&#xD;
barous people ; every traveller who had&#xD;
passed us of late. had whipped up his&#xD;
horse, refusing all communication with&#xD;
us. After halfan hour's further progress&#xD;
we found that we were nearing a village,&#xD;
and remembering the treatment we had&#xD;
already received front the neighboring&#xD;
villages and hamlets, we naturally hesi-&#xD;
tated to venture among the inhabitants of&#xD;
the village before us, fearing even worse&#xD;
results might occur, 'from such a proceed-&#xD;

g rwl of some other wild animal rise on&#xD;
the night blast, and then again all wasc&#xD;
still, save the distant sound of the patter-&#xD;

A   zgi Mthe distance would Gome their&#xD;
deeprumbling sound, as of some mighty&#xD;
tor arch of the wood torn from his bed&#xD;
by the sweeping night blast, and hurled&#xD;
thundering to the ground. And then tlje&#xD;
sounds died away among the trees;&#xD;
again the furious wind and rain alone&#xD;
swept by, the bitter blast howled on, and&#xD;
th. ominous wispering of spirits rose and&#xD;
fell.&#xD;
Willis has said that the sound of the&#xD;
dropping rain is musical and soothing to&#xD;
th,,ear.. It may have uttered melodious&#xD;
s nds to his poetic ear, while snugly&#xD;
sandwitched between two woolen sheets&#xD;
iii his garret bed; but had he made his&#xD;
solitary mid-night bed with us, in the&#xD;
miasmatic bogs of Chili, during that dis-&#xD;
vnal stormy night,: it would 'have struck&#xD;
1ess soothingly on his ear.&#xD;
At last we counted through the long&#xD;
l hours of that strange and sleepless&#xD;
fight, and the gray gloomy dawn came&#xD;
struggling through our leafy casement.&#xD;
At the first peep of day we arose from&#xD;
our disagreeable couch, completely satu-&#xD;
rated with the rain and stiffened with the&#xD;
cold, looking life a mere vapid dilution of&#xD;
our former selves. We rubbed ourbenumb-&#xD;
ed limbs, and performed numerous calis-&#xD;
thenic. exercises to restore the nearly&#xD;
suspended circulation. Our drenching&#xD;
hadsuperseded the necessity of the usual&#xD;
morning ablutions, and without any fur-&#xD;
ther cold water applications, we continued&#xD;
all' dripping; on our weary march, the&#xD;
storm having settled into a cold and driz-&#xD;
zly rain. Sadly and silently we picked&#xD;
&#xD;
our forlorn way onward, wading streams,&#xD;
climbing slippery precipices and stumi.&#xD;
ling over rocks arid underbrush.&#xD;
It cleared off about noon, and the smil.&#xD;
ing sun burst upon us, cheering our droop.&#xD;
ing spirits, and stirring the blood again,&#xD;
gladly through our veins, after it had&#xD;
been so long shrunk away from the sur-&#xD;
face, to escape the chilling touch of the&#xD;
night blast. We removed our wet&#xD;
clothes, and hung them to dry in the sun&#xD;
while we reposed under the shade of the&#xD;
wide speading trees.&#xD;
Our situation among a race of people&#xD;
as ignorant and wild almost as the un-&#xD;
tamed savage, was gloomy and unenvia-&#xD;
ble to the most romantic mind, and I&#xD;
mentally admitted  that "happy is he&#xD;
who neVer saw the smoke of a strangers&#xD;
fire."&#xD;
Having clothed ourselves and gather-&#xD;
ed a few berries and other fruit which&#xD;
we found in the vicinity, to eat on our&#xD;
way, we cut two stout walking sticks,&#xD;
and trudged on, hoping soon to again'&#xD;
discover the path from which, we had&#xD;
wandered the previous night. About' 5&#xD;
o'clock we found ourselves ascending a&#xD;
long sloping hill, its waving and undula-.&#xD;
ted surface abounding with thick clusters&#xD;
of a thorny minosa ; upon reaching the&#xD;
suinit the view that burst upon us was&#xD;
grand and beautiful. A world of, forest&#xD;
lay spread out before us, 'with many a&#xD;
beautiful lake glistening in its green fringe&#xD;
like a basin of silver; the long rapid&#xD;
streams that crossed and skirted' the&#xD;

On nearing the mountains we found&#xD;
them to be a long continuous ridge, tow-&#xD;
ering far into the clouds, and crossing&#xD;
our course at right angles. They seemed&#xD;
indeed to form an impenetrable barrier&#xD;
to our farther progress, unless we could&#xD;
'discver some ravine or gap through&#xD;
which we might pass. Having travelled&#xD;
along the foot of the ridge, for two or&#xD;
bree' hours, without finding any pass&#xD;
through which we could reach the oppo-&#xD;
site side, we came to the conclusion to&#xD;
cl mberup the side of the mountain and&#xD;
sale its heights at the most favorable&#xD;
place which presented.&#xD;
We accordingly began our ascent at&#xD;
the lowest point, where the ridge appear-&#xD;
ed not more than seven or eight hundred&#xD;
feet in height; the sequel however,&#xD;
proved that it must have been mnch&#xD;
more.&#xD;
Near the base of the mountain the an-&#xD;
gle was not more than 25or 30 0, and the&#xD;
ground plentifully covered with low shrub-&#xD;
bery, our progress for the first hour was&#xD;
&#xD;
comparatively easy. From this time we&#xD;
found our way becoming more steep&#xD;
and ragged, the shrubbery began to disap.&#xD;
pear, the soil was loose and broken, and&#xD;
our footing was painfully insecure. - The&#xD;
earth and gravel crumbled away beneath&#xD;
us at almost every step, and the larger&#xD;
stones went leaping and plunging into&#xD;
the vale below, still with our eyes fixed to-&#xD;
wards the summit, we boldly pushed on,&#xD;
until obliged to rest from mere exhaustion&#xD;
and fatigue.&#xD;
On looking into the bosom of the val-&#xD;
ley below us, we were fully aware how&#xD;
steep and dangerous had been our course,&#xD;
and how much more formidable it ap-&#xD;
peared to us now, than while toiling up&#xD;
the ascent. But when we. turned and&#xD;
gazed at the prospect above us, we were&#xD;
almost discouraged, upon observing that&#xD;
scarcely one third of our task had been&#xD;
accomplished, and the remainder of the&#xD;
ascent appeared fearfully steep.-&#xD;
Shelving ledges, perpendicular cliffs,&#xD;
and overhanging crags, seemed to threat-&#xD;

the steep mountain sides, the whole range&#xD;
seemed dyed with glowing pink, and&#xD;
covered with sparklin g ge ms.&#xD;
What an intermingling of lovely hues&#xD;
and shades was here ! We stood silent&#xD;
and breathless, gazing upon the magni-&#xD;
ficent panorama, as though we feared the&#xD;
kast movement might dissolve the spell&#xD;
and break the enchantment; so supernat-&#xD;
ural and radiant was the vision, so sud-&#xD;

valley, which on all sides presented a&#xD;
fetile appearance, and our hunger now&#xD;
prompted us to seek the where-with-all to&#xD;
satisfy its cravings.&#xD;
We diligently searched about for those&#xD;
green berries which had heretofore( so&#xD;
much contributed to- our support. We&#xD;
discovered several different kinds but as&#xD;
we were totaly unacquainted with their&#xD;
properties we feared to eat them, and&#xD;
were forced to satisfy our present wants&#xD;
by chewing the bark of several trees&#xD;
which we knew from previous use were&#xD;
not poisonous.&#xD;
We wandered along without keeping&#xD;
any regular course until late in the&#xD;
afternoon when crossing one of theasmall&#xD;
streams that intersected the ground, we&#xD;
came suddenly upon what appeared to&#xD;
be a foot path indistinctly traced among&#xD;
the grass and roots, and leading up the&#xD;
stream a short distance, when it turned,&#xD;
diverging at right angles from the water.&#xD;

It was near to or quite the 'witchingI&#xD;
hour of midnight; my companion was&#xD;
sleeping soundly by my side, and I had&#xD;
Just faflen into a slumber, when I was&#xD;
prtly awakened by feeling. some one&#xD;
take ite by the arm, speaking some low&#xD;
uhinteligable words. At first I turned&#xD;
restless away, but soon becoming more&#xD;
awake I could discern some person stoop-&#xD;
lng over me whose tears fell fast upon&#xD;
my face. I again turned towards the in-&#xD;
truder, and saw by the flickering light&#xD;
that it was a female form. As I turned&#xD;
she cried in an enquiring tone, 'dios de mi&#xD;
alma! tuno T'ilando? Finding myself in&#xD;
this singular manner accosted by a female,&#xD;
I resolved to see what would result from&#xD;
my assuming this new name thus mys-&#xD;
teriously suggested, therefore when she&#xD;
again anxiously repeated the question,&#xD;
I immediately replyed in a low tone 'Si&#xD;
Pi mi amor, yo say Vilando,' she sprang&#xD;
forward grasped me in her arms and&#xD;
devoured me with warm and ardent kiss-i&#xD;
&#xD;
es. These salutations were not in the&#xD;
least objectionable, or repugnant to my&#xD;
feelings, and of course I returned them&#xD;
with interest. She hurried me to the&#xD;
door of the hut where she stood gazing&#xD;
me full in the face, repeating several&#xD;
times 'Vilando! Vilando! usted Livinia' I&#xD;
caught up the name 'Livinia' and repeat&#xD;
ted it with accents of joy while she threw&#xD;
herself wildly in my arms smothering me&#xD;
with her affectionate  caresses. "Mi&#xD;
amor! mi vido!' cried she in her fullness&#xD;
of bliss. In the mean time all I could&#xD;
do was to repeat over what I had now&#xD;
ascertained to be her name and endeavor&#xD;
as far as in me lay, to return a portion of&#xD;
her loving caresses, not wishing to be out-&#xD;
done by a lady in such matters-&#xD;
Our noise soon awoke Harry, viho ex-&#xD;
claimed at the top of his voice, 'What's&#xD;
all this hubbub, what's going on here ?'&#xD;
My new found friend started in surprise&#xD;
on hearinganother voice. I soothed her,&#xD;
and calling to Harry, I hurridly explained&#xD;

long conversation learnt that'Vilando' was&#xD;
her husband, who had gone out on a&#xD;
hunting excursion a number of days since&#xD;
and not returning, she had supposed him&#xD;
to be lost, and had therefore left her sol-&#xD;

'who lived in the village close by ; that&#xD;
she had seen the smoke and light of our&#xD;

him. Harry stated that the spirit of 'Vi-&#xD;

form, and in fact that I was "Vilando"&#xD;

way into a village a short distance&#xD;
through the trees, containing some eighz&#xD;
ty or ninety houses, and half as many&#xD;
more in the outskirts.&#xD;
Every thing looked lovely around us&#xD;
as we entered this little villiage. The&#xD;
mornirg was now in its freshness,. the&#xD;
path was skirted by numerous flowers&#xD;
and shrubs of tender and graceful foliage;&#xD;
emerald winged parrots, skiped about&#xD;
among the trees, or whistled shrill and&#xD;
clear from the thatched roof. All along&#xD;
the banks of the river that swept silently&#xD;
through th'e village, were seen rich and&#xD;
luxuriant fruit trees, interlacing theik&#xD;
boughs ; some standing at the very edge&#xD;
of the bank, bending their gracefull bran-&#xD;
ches into the water.&#xD;
Their buildings were the usual frail&#xD;
reed structures, that one would hardly&#xD;
.suppose able to keep out the winter winds&#xD;
as mild and temperate as they are,&#xD;
Within they were if possible less cheer&#xD;
ful. Each house could boast of but'lon&#xD;
room only, which served in all the capac-&#xD;
ities of kitchen, parlor and bedrooni. IY&#xD;
each angle were placed the rustic ben-&#xD;
ches, for the couch, and occupied as a&#xD;
lounge by day, and a bed Jby night. The&#xD;
fire was built among a few loose stones'&#xD;
in the centre of the room, the smoke esca-&#xD;
ping, sometimes through an aperture pur.'&#xD;
posely left in the roof, and again as bed&#xD;
it could through the numerous acci4eilat&#xD;
rents and loop holes ; a few scattered&#xD;
blocks served for moveable seats, but,&#xD;
the ground itself was more frequently&#xD;
used.&#xD;
A flock of eager spectators followed s"&#xD;
along while Harry and our guide, ue4&#xD;
their tongues with the greatest dexterity;&#xD;
that could possibly be, concieved6 It&#xD;
&#xD;
although quite a different looking person&#xD;
than formerly, and could speak but very&#xD;
little spanish, all of which, he explained&#xD;
to her entire satisfaction. I endeavored&#xD;
to confirm the impression, by striving to&#xD;
be as affectionate as a fond and confiding&#xD;
husband should be.&#xD;
Harry and myself determined to adhere&#xD;
firmly to the story of the metempsychosis,&#xD;
well knowing that her good ,graces were&#xD;
desirable to secure our kind reception,&#xD;
and if perchance her husband should re-&#xD;
turn to get out of the scrape the best way&#xD;
, we could.&#xD;
We returned into the hut and having&#xD;
renewed our fire sat down and continued&#xD;
our conversation until morning- The col-&#xD;
loquial part of tjhe interview, I could not&#xD;
engage in, much to my credit, and conse-&#xD;

part of the play, in pantomime which I&#xD;
did with such gusto as to fairly astonish,&#xD;

appeared to me one complete Babel&#xD;
However, they explained the matter ac&#xD;
agreed upon, which I soon discovered, by&#xD;
the strange and curious glances that were&#xD;
directed towards ne, and the misteriou&#xD;
handling of my person by some of the&#xD;
bold ones among the crowd. The parent.&#xD;
of Livinia readily received me as themi&#xD;
son-in-law, and I was at once domiciliated&#xD;
as Lord of the castle inthe old hut where&#xD;
we had taken up our night's quarters.&#xD;
I cannot think that the whole commu&#xD;
nity actually believed in the story we&#xD;
'had fabricated, but not being able to&#xD;
contradict it or disprove the story, they&#xD;
let it pass, all for 'good gold.'  e en-&#xD;
deavored by every means in our power&#xD;
to gain the good will of the villagers,&#xD;

degree. In a few days we were treated&#xD;
and feasted to our hearts content. "Livi-&#xD;
ia I found to be a lively companion, a&#xD;
little given to coqueting with the roystering&#xD;
blades of the village, but posessed of a&#xD;
kind and generous heart, and otherwise&#xD;
sufficiently domesticated. We often at-&#xD;
tended the lightly fandangoes, and Harry&#xD;
and myself frequently took occasion to&#xD;
make ourselves agreeable to the "senori-&#xD;
tas," and, although we were neither of&#xD;
us much destinguished for our galantry&#xD;
among the fair sex, we found our efforts&#xD;
in this line proved eminantly successful&#xD;
among these buinettes. Harry in partic-&#xD;
ular was changed to a regular Lothario&#xD;
and smashed up the young maidens hearts&#xD;
like pipe stems. As for me, such at-&#xD;
tempts were idle, for jealous eyes were&#xD;
ever on the watch.&#xD;
The men were an enervated puerile race&#xD;
spending tleir time chiefly in idling and&#xD;
loafing about, ,when not engaged in the&#xD;
sports ofhhe village.&#xD;
&#xD;
1I one day found a torn and soiled basis-&#xD;
s ness card which by dint of much spelling&#xD;
and supplying dificiencies, I finally made&#xD;
out to read as follows.&#xD;

How this card wandered away into&#xD;
this out of the way place, others can&#xD;
conjecture as well as I can, but I care-&#xD;
fully preserved it, as containing the ouly&#xD;
scrap of the English language which I&#xD;
should probably see for some time.&#xD;
Soon after our arrival here, the whole&#xD;
village was thrown into intense excite.,&#xD;
ment, on learning the arrival of a small&#xD;
party of Araucanian Indians in their !vi-&#xD;
cinity. It was probably a small party&#xD;
lured hither by the chase, evidently&#xD;
unconsious of their close proximity to a&#xD;
Spanish town. These Indians ,are a&#xD;
brave and warlike beople, whom the&#xD;
Chilians have never been able to subdue,&#xD;
and they still hold undisputed sway, over&#xD;
a large extent of country. They are di.&#xD;
vided into numerous clans and hold&#xD;
the spanish race in the greatest abhor-&#xD;
ance, waging a war of extermination&#xD;
against the whole race, murdering the&#xD;
inhabitants of the frontier, and frequent-&#xD;
y making descents upon the villages&#xD;
and towns. It was considered by the&#xD;
Spaniards a praiseworthy act, and religious&#xD;
duty, to destroy these terrible enemies&#xD;
whenever chance threw them in their&#xD;
power. The present seemed a fitting&#xD;
opportunity, and the whole male popula"&#xD;
tion capable of bearing arms were soon.&#xD;
in their saddles. Harry and I,'of course&#xD;

Wit of a wite. I replied to hira that I&#xD;
thought there was but littl  need of&#xD;
that, but he seriously informed' me that&#xD;
he had heard of a rich old Englishman,'&#xD;
who had a large and valuable plantation,&#xD;
well stocked with cattle &amp;amp;c. He was al-'&#xD;
so the owner of a rich silver mine, a source'&#xD;
of unbounded wealth. This man was re-'&#xD;
ported to have but- one child, ai only&#xD;
daughter, whorl the father had frequent-&#xD;
been heard to say, he desired to marry to&#xD;
some countryman of his' own.&#xD;
The lady was described as, having a&#xD;
remakable strabismus of her eyes, and&#xD;
being somewhat deformed in her person,&#xD;
but Harry declared that the silver-mine&#xD;
would cover all these blemishes, and, he&#xD;
was determined to hunt her up. "But&#xD;
what is the distance to this 'El Dorado,"'&#xD;
I asked. "Some twenty or thirty miles&#xD;
only,-if I find it a pleasant place to live,&#xD;
I shall send for you, and perhaps by the'&#xD;
aid of the old man's silver mine, we shall&#xD;
be able to get back among civilized peo-&#xD;
ple once more."&#xD;
I could say but little for or against the&#xD;
project, and I found it useless to murmur.&#xD;
He parted from me full of visions of fu-&#xD;
ture happiness. I did not fully realize,&#xD;
until after his aepature, how much I was&#xD;
indebted to him for companioLship. . I&#xD;
grew lonesome and melancholy. Ibegan&#xD;
to imagine him in all kinds of danger&#xD;
my fancy pictured him dead or dying a&#xD;
thousand times, and I finally settled&#xD;
down in the firm conviction that I never&#xD;
should see him ag .&#xD;
One day after my Indian friend had&#xD;
fully recovered, and was descanting on1&#xD;
the happiness of his return among his&#xD;
people, I enquired whether they would&#xD;
receve me, if I should accompany him,&#xD;

it would be difficult to make them believe&#xD;
L was not a "Spanio." Still Guvedio, the&#xD;
more he considered the matter, the more&#xD;
anxious he betalne to introduce me to his&#xD;
people, and finally would not admit of a&#xD;
denial. I could but admire the delibera-&#xD;
tiveness with which he canvassed the&#xD;
question of taking me to his home,,and I&#xD;
felt perfectly satisfied after his first decis-&#xD;
ion, it would be safe for me to venture&#xD;
among them.&#xD;
Giving up all hopes that Harry would&#xD;
ever more be heard from, I decided&#xD;
to leave with my Indian friend ; the life&#xD;
that I led having become monotonous in&#xD;
the extreme. We made all our arrange-&#xD;
ments for the departure, and I had the&#xD;
young Indian (still apparently unable to&#xD;
stand 'alone,) conveyed to one of the&#xD;
houses in the village to be cared for,while&#xD;
my cabin was undergoing some repairs.&#xD;
I took this precaution to hide my conni-&#xD;
vance at his escape, not wishing to gain&#xD;
the ill will of those who had thus far be-&#xD;
friended me.&#xD;
The first night after his removal, the&#xD;
sick man disappeared. Their surprise&#xD;

with the most wild and enquiring look.&#xD;
I still kept at a respectful distance as I&#xD;
observed Guyedio explaining to her the&#xD;
relation in which I stood to him;'and his&#xD;
obligations to me.&#xD;
It was some time before he could make&#xD;
her understand that I was a friend. At&#xD;
last I deemed it a fitting opportunity for&#xD;
rue tooin te group, and dismounting, 1&#xD;
p uiked an oak-leaf, and approaching the.&#xD;
'timidcreature, I gently placed it in her&#xD;

T will endeavor to describe the appear-&#xD;
-nce of this lovely forest maiden, as she&#xD;
afterwards occupied an important part in&#xD;
the drama of my sojourn among this sin-&#xD;
gular people.&#xD;
She stood about five feet eight inches&#xD;
hg height, straight as- an arrow; her fig-&#xD;
-re was plump rounded and natural,&#xD;
with a stately majestic carriage; her long&#xD;
black hair-as glossy as the ravens pluipage&#xD;
coated in waving tresses down her should&#xD;
deks, the jetty looks clustered in from her&#xD;
tooth brow, by a wreath of wild flow-&#xD;
ers and green leaves, which she wore&#xD;
around her head as gracefully as the&#xD;
"rown of the Brittish Queen.&#xD;
A plume of gaudy colored feathers&#xD;
intng gracefully drooping from her floral&#xD;
head dress, giving her quite a theatrical&#xD;
appearance. Her arge black eyes, were&#xD;
&#xD;
as bright and sparkling, as if a glittering&#xD;
tear was gathering in the rounded orb;&#xD;
her complexion was that of a dark bru.&#xD;
nette, and when the smiled, or was ani-&#xD;
mated in conversation, she . displayed&#xD;
a beautiful set of teeth, pearly white, be.&#xD;
tween a pair of tempting lips, that would&#xD;
almost make a lover forget his mistress.&#xD;
Her dress was of primeval simplicity.&#xD;
It consisted of a plain linen skirt,&#xD;
which was secured aro    her waist,&#xD;
reaching as far down towards her feet,&#xD;
as the skirts, of some of our beautiful dance.&#xD;
ing Nymphs, who have oft and many a&#xD;
time, entranced the patrons of the Bowe-&#xD;
ry.&#xD;
She wore neither shoes or stockings,&#xD;
yet there is not a belle in New England&#xD;
but would have envied, that small ele-&#xD;
gant foot, so narrow, so delicately form-&#xD;
ed, so beautifully turned at the ankle.&#xD;
In her ears she wore the brightest jew-&#xD;
els and fBowers, she could find. Her&#xD;
joyous laugh and gleeful shout, echoed&#xD;
melodiously among the hills. She was&#xD;
as wild and daring as the mountain goat,&#xD;
and almost as fleet and nimble in her&#xD;
antic sports. Such was "Metina" the&#xD;
sister of Guve dio, and upon further&#xD;
acquaintance I. discovered that her heart&#xD;
was all unscathed; the image of none of&#xD;
her brave wooers, had been stamped&#xD;
there. She was "in, maiden meditation-&#xD;
fancy free,"&#xD;
After a few moments conversation,&#xD;
Gutedio deemed it the safest plan to&#xD;
send her forward to announce our ap-&#xD;
proach, and impress the natives with&#xD;
frielship towards me, as the preserver&#xD;
of their young chief. She sprang nimbly&#xD;
upon pne of the horses, and was off in 0.&#xD;

the valley, echoing ameng the distant&#xD;
l ills, as the glorious news spread rapidl&#xD;
through the group. Soon we emerge&#xD;
into the clearing; my heart beat furiousl&#xD;
as I'beheld a mass of savages hurrying t4&#xD;
wards us. Metina was foremost in th&#xD;
group, still mounted. She galloped uj&#xD;
to our side, and soon we were in the cen&#xD;
ter of the dusky throng.&#xD;
They were all dressed nearly as airy a&#xD;
John Bull's protege, the celebrated "Mos&#xD;
quito, King," who, it .is affirmed by&#xD;
grave historians, holds his Royal Court&#xD;
in the back yard of the British Consul&#xD;
dressed in the airy costume of "a cocked&#xD;
hat, ied' sash and spurs," and seated&#xD;
astride of a Whiskey Barrel.&#xD;
My friend Guvedio was instantly dragged&#xD;
from the hose, and nearly devoured by&#xD;
the caresses of the glad natives. His sis-&#xD;
ter on some signal from him grasped the&#xD;
rains of my animal and hurried me out&#xD;
of the croud which was growing more&#xD;
and more dense, and rode forward to her&#xD;
own house. After a few hours I found,&#xD;
that Guvedio had settled all scruples in&#xD;
regard to myself. The natives would&#xD;
occasionaly wander towards the htit&#xD;
where I was seated with Metina and&#xD;
others, and offer to me their thanks for&#xD;
the kindness I had shown their friend;&#xD;
all of which save the kind and thankful&#xD;
looks' were at the time quite unintelligible&#xD;

and when fresh and new afforded a lux-&#xD;

each bed from the main apartment and&#xD;
from each other. The cabins contained&#xD;
two, three, or four beds according to the&#xD;
wants of the family. On the front side&#xD;

a large square log which' served for the&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
Our establishment was thronged dur- yet his tall stately form had but slightly&#xD;
&#xD;
ing the evening with numerous visitors,&#xD;
and I noticed with pleasure the univer-&#xD;
sal attachrd&amp;amp;ent with which Guvedio was&#xD;
regarded. He would turn to me often and&#xD;
endeavor to explain the substance of&#xD;
their remarks; some of the more fiery ones&#xD;
I noticed were anxious to sally out and&#xD;
visit the Spaniards with a sprinkling of&#xD;
war, and Guvedio appeared disposed to&#xD;
listen favorably to the scheme. His eyes&#xD;
would brighten up at the thought of&#xD;
victory and revenge. When we were&#xD;
alone I endeavored to dissuade Guvedio&#xD;
from the project of invading the Spanish&#xD;
settlements, telling him that in case his&#xD;
people succeeded in breaking up the&#xD;
village it would soon be again inhabited,&#xD;
as the Spaniards were as plenty as the&#xD;
leaves on the trees. I described to&#xD;
him the large cities of Conception, Santi-&#xD;
ago, and Valparaiso, and as I heard no&#xD;
more about it I suppose the project was&#xD;
abandoned or postponed.&#xD;
In the morning I was conducted to the&#xD;
chief, where I found assembled all the&#xD;
tribe, male and female. The old men&#xD;
and females were seated nearest to the&#xD;
chief, whose whitened locks betokened&#xD;
that the weight of years was upon him,&#xD;
&#xD;
yielded to the inroads of time. Guvedio&#xD;
sat at his feet, and myself, being the ob-&#xD;
ject of consideration, was seated close to&#xD;
my friend who acted as a sort of interpre-&#xD;
ter. In answer to the first question as to&#xD;
what nation I belonged, I gave then to&#xD;
understand that I came from the north, a&#xD;
great many miles, over a large lake a&#xD;
thousand times as large as theirs ; that I&#xD;
came in a large canoe that would hold an&#xD;
army of men. My description of the&#xD;
working of the vessel filled them with ex-&#xD;
treme wonder ; but old Augus-ti-ne-vi nod-&#xD;
ded his head in a knowing manner, and&#xD;
assured them that he had heard ot such&#xD;
a wonder before.&#xD;
I told them that the people ofmy coun-&#xD;
try were as numerous as the trees in the&#xD;
forest; that they traveled all over the&#xD;
world; that there was scarcely a spot up-&#xD;
on the whole globe which had not been&#xD;
visited by sone of them, and that I, par-&#xD;
taking of the- roaming character of my&#xD;
countrymen, had been led to visit them&#xD;
here. I furthermore informed them that&#xD;
some of my people could make machines&#xD;
to travel through the air like birds, and&#xD;
that some day they might be surprised to&#xD;
see some of them fly down from over the&#xD;
&#xD;
mountains and alight among them like a them to renewed attempts; and in a few&#xD;

my attention was called to the ceremony&#xD;

a hollow place in the ground, of sufficient-&#xD;
dimensions to contain the body of the&#xD;
animal which wasto form the principal&#xD;

and 0"rough some shapeless breach, gaze&#xD;
o the high-born torrent, as he came&#xD;
1eins; from his-giddy shelf, twisting ands&#xD;

below, then struggling in'his hasty retreat&#xD;
frt thebbiling chaldron,' rush,-with pan-&#xD;
bti reath,' to the calm embraces of the&#xD;
.placid lake. Again we would glide into&#xD;
&#xD;
the quiet nooks and dells, and land in-the&#xD;
deep recesses, where the light scarcely,&#xD;
entered,.and tread the deep mazes' of&#xD;
these caverns and grottoes of the cliffs;&#xD;
with slow ahd cautions steps,; then issu.&#xD;
ing forth again we would lay in our float-&#xD;
ing cradle on the still glassy surface of&#xD;
the lake, and gaze on the clouds, the&#xD;
rocks, and the deep rich foliage reflected&#xD;
on its bosom.&#xD;
While out on one of these excursions,&#xD;
enjoying the enchanting scenery of the&#xD;
lake and the landscape, I proposed that&#xD;
we should extend' our sail further and&#xD;
proceed down the river where I had not&#xD;
yet been. .Metina accordingly directed&#xD;
our head to the outlet of the pond, and&#xD;
sent the light fabric skimming over the&#xD;
glassy surface. On entering the river&#xD;
my eyes were enraptured with the love-&#xD;
ly images which were constantly pre.&#xD;
sentirg themselves, The scenery along&#xD;
the river was variable and, delightful, the&#xD;

tation flourished in abundance, and' here&#xD;
among fruits of gold, had been formed;ta&#xD;
delightful path, hugging the stream in all,&#xD;
its windings, gorgeously strown with ge-&#xD;
raniums, whispering thyrtles, and other&#xD;
flowering shrubs, along its winding ave-&#xD;
nues. At points along the. river,. gentle&#xD;
undulating declivities came sloping down&#xD;
to the waters edge from the far off' hills&#xD;
which lifted up their heads in the dis-&#xD;
tance, while the mystic and dark clouds&#xD;
hung like spirit shapes on their highand&#xD;
frosty cones.&#xD;
Sometimes a thicket of cane break,&#xD;
with tangled masses of wild shrubs and&#xD;
creeping plants decorated the bank, and&#xD;
were vocal with the songs of birds ; the&#xD;
streaming of the sunbeams on their gay&#xD;
plumage, the burnished river beneath us,&#xD;
and the dark belt of forest trees stands&#xD;
ing out in bold relief against the illumin.I&#xD;
ed sky, presented a gorgeous scenic&#xD;
view scarce equalled in the world. A-&#xD;
long the whole course of this delightful&#xD;
stream, its banks were margined with a]&#xD;
fringe of perpetual glossy verdure, and&#xD;
its bright pathway, winding in a thous-&#xD;
and graceful mazes, was charmed with&#xD;
the  musical notes of the featheredI&#xD;
songster and its own clear voice of gush-I&#xD;
ing melody,&#xD;
Along the sides of the gentle declivi-&#xD;
ties rising before us, were the fig trees&#xD;
and citrons, the luscious peach, and the&#xD;
high spreading palm, with the tresselledc&#xD;
vines in their richest foliage, decking the&#xD;
narrow areas, the whole together exhibit- l&#xD;
ingl one blended scene of rural loveliness,i&#xD;
For hours we skimmed' along in si-t&#xD;

five or six foxes, one vicuna, some half'&#xD;
dozen chinchilas, and a few of a species of&#xD;
rat whose skins are highly prized. The&#xD;
Guanaco,a species of goat considered very&#xD;
difficult to kill were seen in the neigh-&#xD;
borhood but none were taken. Their wool&#xD;
is fine and valuable, more so than any&#xD;
other animals which are sought after. I&#xD;
killed two of the chinchillas, which are&#xD;
little animals about the size of a cat-&#xD;
having fur not inferior to a martini. I&#xD;
also shot a large condor. This bird pos-&#xD;
sesses amazing, strength and will run or&#xD;
fly with incredible swiftness. They are&#xD;
three or four times larger than our eagle&#xD;
with wings at least fourteen feet from&#xD;

with a white collar round its neck. After&#xD;

Wj  were off in the .morning scarcely&#xD;
waiting to swallow our breakfast. I had&#xD;
.shot nothing during the morning but one&#xD;
jQc although I had fired at and missed&#xD;
,two -others.  During  my peranbala-&#xD;
tions ihad gained a wild and romantic&#xD;
..ft.  among the mountains; on every&#xD;
ie ,ere numerous holes, caverns and&#xD;
pt eplifis, Ihad been led here in pursuit&#xD;
qfta olle looking Guanico which I was&#xD;
ipgly anxious to take. -While&#xD;
pgnt  creeping about among the rocks&#xD;
,igogsre d gbjecpf my pursuit justI&#xD;
be was aggig starting. for a run, his{&#xD;
vdwgol looking like a sun-wilted rose.&#xD;
1astily raised my gun and fired ; he'&#xD;
prOg forward severely wounded in some&#xD;
pastof   body. In his flight he darted&#xD;
~to on pf tihe cavernous holes, that pen&#xD;
&#xD;
etrated into the mountains; I hastily fol.&#xD;
lowed in his track but-soon. lost sight of&#xD;
him however in the darkness which per.&#xD;
vaded the subterranean vault,but hearing&#xD;
mysprize ashort distance in advance of me&#xD;
as he bounded among the broken stones,&#xD;
I pressed on, although with' extreme&#xD;
difficulty, my head often coming in con-&#xD;
tact with the low arches.&#xD;
The passage soon became exceedingly&#xD;
narrow and in some places so low that I&#xD;
was forced to creep forward upon my&#xD;
hands and knees. I crawled on in this&#xD;
manner some distance, hoping every,&#xD;
moment to lay my hand upon the&#xD;
animal which I was pursuing, when I&#xD;
heard a scraping noise and plunge not&#xD;
three feet a-head of me, and before I had&#xD;
time to think ot the cause, I found my-&#xD;
self tumbling down a deep clasm in the&#xD;
bottom of the cave, and alighted plump&#xD;
upon the body of the wounded Guanico!&#xD;
I dropped the gun during my descent&#xD;
but found it again without much difficulty.&#xD;
I was not seriously injured by the fall&#xD;
but what was my consternation to find&#xD;
that i was impossable to regain the top&#xD;
of the sedge from which I-had fallen. I&#xD;
tried in vain to clamber up the smooth&#xD;

of water that run pouring along the bot-&#xD;
tom of the cave, trusting it might lead&#xD;
me towards daylight. With my gun in&#xD;
my land I groped my way along, crawl-&#xD;
ing on my hands and knees down the&#xD;
oozy sdes of steep waterfalls, or sliding&#xD;
over the slippery surface of the rocks&#xD;
through some low arch while stretched&#xD;
out at my full length, the merciless water&#xD;
washing my prostrate form; and again&#xD;
squeezing through numerous narrow pas-&#xD;
sages that seemed at first scarcely wide&#xD;
enough to admit a cat, or stumbling over&#xD;
broken fragments of rocks which covered&#xD;
the bed of the water course. I often felt&#xD;
that my race was nearly run, expecting&#xD;
momentarily to tumble over into some&#xD;
deep basin, dashing my brains out upon'&#xD;
the heaps of sharp stones at the bottom.&#xD;
What a horrid place was this to die in,&#xD;
with nought but the echoes of the rippling&#xD;
waters to knell my souls exit ! what a&#xD;
noisome mouldy shroud would cover my&#xD;
form in this damp and dismal cavern!&#xD;
I tried to whistle up my courage and&#xD;
drive away these horrid thoughts but&#xD;
every slip of my foot on the slimy ledge&#xD;
would kindle them anew. With these&#xD;
dismal thoughts I continued my sorrow-&#xD;
ful course through these winding subte-&#xD;
raneous corridors of the Andes.&#xD;
This it is true was the dark side of the.&#xD;
picture. Every situation in life it is said&#xD;
has its lights and shadows, and mine I&#xD;
found had its glittering points, and themes&#xD;
for variety ; for had the, hollow worldly&#xD;
honors of pomp and pageantry, the power&#xD;
to influence my pride, I might have been&#xD;
flattered with the idea that over my moul-&#xD;
dering remains would stand one of the&#xD;
proudest monuments in the world. That&#xD;
I should have above me the topling crags&#xD;
&#xD;
-of the lofty Qordilleras for Ty pedestal,&#xD;
and the earthquake's solemn monio&#xD;
chant forth my requium.&#xD;
After many. dreary hours of taure&#xD;
and suspense in worming myself ,hr ihih&#xD;
these  low  and   damp    arche;  I&#xD;
caught sight at last of a golden strea1pof&#xD;
day-light. I had emerged into   gr&#xD;
e opening where I could walk with eap ,&#xD;
and which appeared some ten or twe e&#xD;
feet in height; at the end, the lightust&#xD;
gleamed through a small and narrow Ceoy-&#xD;
ice. I hastened forward towards this gol-&#xD;
den gleam of light as fast as the darkness&#xD;
would permit, and discovered a narrow&#xD;
rent in the ledge not more than two or&#xD;
three inches wide. I was almost in des-&#xD;
pair at my disappointment,but knowingit&#xD;
was useless to despond, I began a search-&#xD;
ing examination on all-sides, and son&#xD;
found that near the floor the ledge was&#xD;
loose and shaky, so that with but very&#xD;
little trouble I enlarged the aperturesuf-&#xD;
ficiently to crawl out of my dreary prison&#xD;
house.  Aristomines, the hero of 'es-&#xD;
sina, could not have been more pleased&#xD;
at his escape from the subterraneous pas-&#xD;
sage of the horrids charnel cavern of Ce.&#xD;
ada, than I was at my final exit from the&#xD;
bowels of the Andes.&#xD;
It was quite dark when I emerged into&#xD;
the open air, and after two hours travel&#xD;
I saw with delight the fire of our srall&#xD;
encanipment, where stood my own ltte&#xD;
tent welcoming me with its 6pen portal.&#xD;
I arrived faint, hungry and weary, 'at ur&#xD;
welcome woodland bower. I found rny&#xD;
companions all in and anxiously waidig&#xD;
for me. They were much surprised0and&#xD;

as sound and pleasant as a New Yorl&#xD;

In the morning I found that my gut&#xD;
needed a great deal of fixing to get i&#xD;

somee pretty hard thumps and bruises dur&#xD;
ing its'transit 'through the earth. Witi1&#xD;
the assistance of one of my companions&#xD;
We managed to get it in tolerable good&#xD;
order, and after trying it two or three time&#xD;
at a mark, I was satisfied of its power of&#xD;
doing justice, when called upon to performs&#xD;
duty.              -    .&#xD;
We started for the depot of the under-&#xD;
ground rail-road which I had so thoroughly&#xD;
explored the dy previous, and after some&#xD;
ingenious contrivances succeeded in haul-&#xD;
ing out my prize ; this was the firstlour&#xD;
party had secured, and of course I was&#xD;
j ustly proud.&#xD;
During the remainder of this day we&#xD;
were all much more successful than we&#xD;
had before been ; we surprised a drove&#xD;
of vicunas, and succeeded in capturing&#xD;
several, we killed some twenty chinchil-&#xD;
las, ten or twelve foxes and rats, and- a&#xD;
few smaller animals whose names were&#xD;
unknown to me. I clambered during the&#xD;
day nearly to the summit of one of the&#xD;
lofty peaks, that raised its majestic head&#xD;
far into the regions of the clouds. As I&#xD;
toiled up the rugged steep, I thought of&#xD;
the gallant "San Martin," who led the&#xD;
liberating army across this formidable&#xD;
srrier-an achievement more daring and&#xD;
difficult than that of the renowned "Han-&#xD;
nibal" in crossing the Alps. BLdt no ob-&#xD;

t teen days he crossed the frozen'Andes, a&#xD;
distance of 300 miles, with baggage and&#xD;
artillery, over rugged and apparently in-&#xD;
n accessible summits, through narrow de.&#xD;
files where two could scarcely  w'alk&#xD;
1 abreast, and along the giddy verge of&#xD;
frightful precipices, icy with the eternal&#xD;
frosts which here hold their undisputed&#xD;
reign. Having conquered the Andes, he&#xD;
encountered the royalists at Chacabuco,&#xD;
and won a signal victory over the instru-&#xD;
ments of tyranny, he afterwards com-&#xD;
pletely overthrew and annihilated the&#xD;
Spanish army, and sealed the independ.&#xD;
ence of Chili on the plains of Maypu.&#xD;
I soon gained an altitude above the&#xD;
floating vapors of the earth. It was a&#xD;
grand and marvellous sight to witness the.&#xD;
clouds floating beneath me, and hiding'at&#xD;
ti mes all traces of the boundless forest&#xD;
and spreading out like the vast ocean as&#xD;
far as the eye could reach, with the moun-&#xD;
tain tops peering through the mist like&#xD;
islands resting on the bosom of the un-&#xD;
fathomable'deep. It required but a very&#xD;
slight degree of ideality to imagine the&#xD;
huge billows following each otherin rapid&#xD;
succession, and breaking against the&#xD;
mountain sides, sending their' whiteied&#xD;
foam curling up in endless shapeseven&#xD;
to their very summits, ad thence moving&#xD;
offin the distance like an ariii of Ossiarls&#xD;
&#xD;

I was transported with the everchang-&#xD;
ing scene, and loitered away many hours,&#xD;
so loth was I to quit the enchanting spot&#xD;
but .the occasional report of my comrades'&#xD;

accordingly turned to Guvedio and asked&#xD;
him for two horses and an escort to conduct&#xD;
us towards the Patriot army. The hors-&#xD;
es were immediately furnished, and&#xD;
Guvedio agreed to join the escort, not&#xD;
doubting, our intention to return again.&#xD;
In two hours from the time that Harry&#xD;
made his first appearance, five of us were&#xD;
dashing through the woods, under a full&#xD;
press of rein and spurs. We rode rapid-&#xD;
ly all night, and found during the next&#xD;
day we had struck the trail of the advance-&#xD;
ing column. I now explained to Guve-&#xD;
dio our intention, and the danger of his&#xD;
proceeding any further with us. The&#xD;
truth seemed to flash suddenly upon his&#xD;
mind. It was an event lie had not be-&#xD;
fore dreamed of, and consequently he was&#xD;
but little prepared  for the' seperation.&#xD;
He caught my hand ands with the most&#xD;
entreating looks and words urged me to&#xD;
return. 1 was greatdydistressed at the&#xD;
parting scene, and wi.h difficulty extrica-&#xD;
ted myself from his grasp promising to&#xD;
return again by and by if I lived.&#xD;
I removed my cravat. and placing it on&#xD;
his neck, directed him to give it to Me-&#xD;
tina. I then affectionately gave him a&#xD;
parting embrace, jumped on my horse,&#xD;
and dashed forward on the trail of the&#xD;
moving army. I turned my head once&#xD;
and saw my Indian friend, with lingering&#xD;
looki still gazing after me. I stood up in&#xD;
my stirrups,'lifted my hat, and swinging&#xD;
it round and round, gave him my final&#xD;

&#xD;
adieu. We now put spurs to our horses,&#xD;
and drove on at a rapid rate, fully confi-&#xD;
dent we should come up with the encamp.&#xD;
meant before day break and so it turned&#xD;
out.&#xD;
We saw the camp-fires about midnight,.&#xD;
and rode boldly up to the entry. We&#xD;
were detained until the commander was&#xD;
informed of the circumstances of our ar-&#xD;
rival, when after a few words of explana-&#xD;
tion we were welcomed within the lines,&#xD;
and patrook of a soldier's fare.&#xD;
Our story excited much wonder, and we&#xD;
were looked upon with as much amaze-&#xD;
ment aswe had before excited among-&#xD;
less enlightened beings. During our&#xD;
march to Valparaiso, we were the lions.&#xD;
of the army, and our adventures, the&#xD;
theme of constant discussion.&#xD;
We arrived at Valparaiso, in a few&#xD;
days where we were strongly urged to&#xD;
join the army, on their expedition to Pe-&#xD;
ru. This arrangement we declined, but&#xD;
compromised the matter with them, how-&#xD;
ever, by entering the Patriot Naval ser-&#xD;
vice. The brig of war "Achilles," Com.&#xD;
Paul Delano, was laying in the harbor,&#xD;
ready for sea. We accordingly shipped&#xD;
in her, and immediately repaired on&#xD;
board.&#xD;
Valparaiso when viewd from the an-&#xD;
chorage, scarcely merits the name it&#xD;
bears, (the vale of Paradise.) At the&#xD;
first glance it appears dark, craggy and&#xD;
fearful; broken into suceessive hills, val-&#xD;
leys, and wild glens, with a small por-&#xD;
tion of sand beach, scarce wide enough&#xD;
for a mule path. In the back ground,&#xD;
hills iise upon hills overlooking, each&#xD;
other, and extending far in: the distance,&#xD;
where their summits are crownedby :the&#xD;
snow-capped Andes. Hero,'amnong these&#xD;

&#xD;
wild cliffs, steep promentoiies and bar.&#xD;
ren hills stands the city of Valparaiso, a&#xD;
place, which, when once seen, will nevi&#xD;
er be forgotten.  As the Rev. Waltei&#xD;
Colton says. "It will stand alone- in&#xD;
your after dreams, like Jacob's ladder.&#xD;
like the rounds of that airy vision, its buil -&#xD;
dings ascend roof over roof, till they seem&#xD;
to topple in the sky."  Vie wed from the&#xD;
sea its appearance is truly picturesque:&#xD;
the houses grouped thickly together, ap-&#xD;
parently without order on the three&#xD;
principal hills, with the valley's and&#xD;
spaces between, resemble several dis-&#xD;
tinct towns. A turmber of neat detach-&#xD;
ed houses are built on little levels arti-&#xD;
ficialy formed on the sides of the hiih&#xD;
fronting the harbor, while now and they&#xD;
a stray white house is to be seen on some&#xD;
lofty hill beyond.&#xD;
The harbor scarcely deserves the name.&#xD;
It is but little better than an open road-&#xD;
steac\, entirely exposed on the north and&#xD;
west, to the "Northers" which are often&#xD;
violent, and are an admonition to all ships&#xD;
to slip their cables. Many vessels have&#xD;
been driven a shore, on a rock, called&#xD;
"little Cape Horn."  On the south it isI&#xD;
protected by a little promontory, called&#xD;
'Puenta de Coro Milla,' where the shore&#xD;
is steep and rocky; from hence, the bay&#xD;
extends from E to W in the form of at&#xD;
gently curved crescent. Fort San Anton-&#xD;
ia is on the south inlet of the bay, andI&#xD;
"Castello del Resario," mounting six guns&#xD;
stands in the north part of the town.&#xD;
Immediately in front of the bay, and one&#xD;
fourth of a mile on the east and west, ist&#xD;
the principal commercial city of business&#xD;
and fashion. Back and westward of this&#xD;
are three large groups of houses scattered&#xD;
on the three hills, called by the sailors,&#xD;
&#xD;
0&#xD;
&#xD;
#   -&#xD;
&#xD;
the "Fore, Main and Mizen-tops:"' About&#xD;
half a mile eastward on the lowland, is1&#xD;
the 'A lmendra'-Almond grove=where&#xD;
the houses extend perhaps a mile or&#xD;
more; they are built like the others, prin_&#xD;
cipally of reeds, some are constructed of&#xD;
abedos. The Custom House - however is&#xD;
a beautiful and spacious building,, and&#xD;
from its situation on the mole where the,&#xD;
stranger first lands, is an object which&#xD;
attracts the attention of all who arrive&#xD;
at Valparaiso. Quite near the Custora&#xD;
House is another fine building called the&#xD;
Exchange.&#xD;
There is a peculiar inconsistency con&#xD;
nected with the interior of the dwellings&#xD;
which cannot fail to strike an American&#xD;
with sur rise. The plainest looking c t*&#xD;
tages which gleam from the topling cliffs;&#xD;
are provided with the most costly, and&#xD;
aristocratic furniture. The piano, the&#xD;
'harp and guitar are heard in almost every&#xD;
house.. They appear   singularly  out.&#xD;
of place in these savage abodes. The&#xD;
most elegant articles of ornament are al-&#xD;
so found in their fancy shops, and the&#xD;
ladies are decked out with large ribh tor-&#xD;
toise shells combs, wrought into various&#xD;
figures.,&#xD;
The Elective franchise in Chili is the&#xD;
same as in America. No property quali-&#xD;
fication is required, all go to the ballot&#xD;
box, yet a majority of them can scarcely&#xD;
be called independent voters, influenced&#xD;
and overawed as they are, by the priests&#xD;
and land-holders, by the priests at the&#xD;
confessional, and by the landlords with&#xD;
their (rentals,) for the innequality of the&#xD;
feudal system still survives as originated&#xD;
from Old Spain. The lands are owned&#xD;
by the privileged few, and their succession&#xD;
secured by theriight of entail.&#xD;
