&#xD;
CHAPTER L&#xD;
In the morning twilight of the tenth da&#xD;
of &amp;amp;pril of the year eighteen hundred and&#xD;
forty-six, Lopez Pecosta, an aged citizen of&#xD;
Santiago, as he looked across the great&#xD;
gulf toward the east, observed the dim out-&#xD;
line of a ships hulk, floating within the&#xD;
moutn of the river. Surprised at a sight so&#xD;
unusual~ for at that day a vessel seldom en-&#xD;
tered the channel, he picked up his walking&#xD;
itick and trudged down the bank of the&#xD;
stream, until he stood directly opposite.&#xD;
Leaning forward upon his staff, which he&#xD;
planted firmly on the ground foji support, he&#xD;
raised his hand to the broad brim of his&#xD;
hard felt hat, and p~illed it a little downward&#xD;
to intercept ~he glimmering. After intently&#xD;
gazing for a few moments, he was enabled to&#xD;
make out a schooner oftwo or three hundred&#xD;
tons burthen: but the darkness prevented&#xD;
more particular observation.&#xD;
~ot content wIth what. he could discern he&#xD;
shifted the position of his hand, and placing&#xD;
it behind his ear, bent to the segment of a&#xD;
circle, endeavored to distinguish the conver-&#xD;
sation of those on board. But the bustle&#xD;
of the sailors, busily employed at some sort&#xD;
of noisy labor, and the confusion of different&#xD;
voices, several persons speaking at the same&#xD;
moment, completely baffled his effoit. ~ever-&#xD;
theless, he wee now and then able to ce.t~h a&#xD;
word, more distinctly or loudly uttered than&#xD;
Iii fellows, and became satisfied that the&#xD;
&#xD;
language used, although he conki not under&#xD;
stand its meaning, was English, and strongly&#xD;
suspected that those on board were Amen'&#xD;
cans.&#xD;
This conclusion seemed to inspire the old&#xD;
man with renewed vigor, for he instantly&#xD;
raised himself from his leaning posture, and&#xD;
stood firmly upon his own natural suppor-&#xD;
ters. "Thank God!" he exclaimed, with a&#xD;
gesture of reverence, "myprayer is answered.&#xD;
Here is a way opened, and through it I shall&#xD;
conduct to power the pride of his conntry~.&#xD;
to power which he only ougnt w exercise&#xD;
over a country which he alone can save from&#xD;
destruction."&#xD;
Having uttered these words, he walked&#xD;
quickly aws~ toward the village; but after a&#xD;
few paces, changing his intention, turned&#xD;
again to the vessel, .which he hailed; as if he&#xD;
would assure himself before he returned.&#xD;
"Ahoy, ship I" he cried in the Spanish&#xD;
tongue, hoping to attract the attention of&#xD;
those on board, and to elicit an answer that&#xD;
would quiet his doubts.&#xD;
"Who calls, and for whatpurpose?" replied&#xD;
the Captain of the vessel, In the same Ian.&#xD;
guags.&#xD;
On hearing this answer, the old man ez-&#xD;
claimed with a great oath, "l)ecelved again,&#xD;
again disappointed." And in the anger of&#xD;
the moroes4, he gnashed his teeth and struck&#xD;
the ground repeatedly with his cane, which&#xD;
was split from the socket to the haft, and&#xD;
rendered entirely useless.&#xD;

"Doeshe know ivho we arc?" inquired the&#xD;
state.&#xD;
"No," replied Captaiu Leonard; "but as&#xD;
oou as the sun dispels the twilight, he will&#xD;
not only discover our true character, but de-&#xD;
tect me in a falsehood."&#xD;
"A falsehood!" repeated the mate, "Why,&#xD;
what did you tell him?"&#xD;
In reply, Captiiin Leonard rehearsed the&#xD;
conversation that had passed between hini~&#xD;
self avid Pecosta in the presence of Mr. WI!-&#xD;
hams, who, like the rest of the crew, utider~&#xD;
stood not a word of Spanish.&#xD;
"And whether the curiosity of you old&#xD;
Mexican is satisfied," he added in conclusion~&#xD;
"depends entirely upon the degree of credit&#xD;
he attaches to my story; but otir safety de-&#xD;
pends, in a great measure, upon our own ex-&#xD;
ertions; for as soon asit becomes known that&#xD;
a vessel is in the river, the banks will be&#xD;
covered with both male and female lenders&#xD;
of almost every age, laden down ~with bread&#xD;
and meat, and garden vegetables, wishing t~&#xD;
traffic. I have traded a great deal among'&#xD;
these people, and am well acquainted with&#xD;
their customs."&#xD;
"What course do you propose to follow?"&#xD;
inquired Mr. Williams, who was beginning&#xD;
to grow uneasy.&#xD;
"In the first place," replied the skipper,&#xD;
"the stars and stripes must be lowered, and&#xD;
the flag of Buenos Ayres run up in their&#xD;
stead. In the next pls\ce, we must throw a&#xD;
tarpaulin over the barrels upon the upper&#xD;
deck, and permit nothing to remain visible&#xD;
that may be distinguished from the shore and&#xD;
lead to our detection. And in thethirdjlace&#xD;
if they come, as I believe they will, we must&#xD;
trade with them on the shore, and endeavor&#xD;
to engage their attention until the flood ena-&#xD;
bles us to escape."&#xD;
"But suppose they come in boats, as is&#xD;
frequently the case at New Orleans and G~i.&#xD;
veston with those who wish to sell or barter&#xD;
vegetables?" suggested Mr. Williams.&#xD;
~'We must immediately weigh anchorl' ~&#xD;
plied the Captaib, "and pass out of the river&#xD;
beyond the possibility of such intrusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
TItlE RANGER'S REVENGE.'&#xD;
&#xD;
There is space' enough between the bar and&#xD;
the shore to ensure our safety, as the canoes&#xD;
of these people would be swallowed up in&#xD;
such billows as are now dashing against the&#xD;
beach"&#xD;
Turning to the sailors, who wore sitting&#xD;
about in difi~etent places, spinning yarns for&#xD;
the amusement of each other~ he cried, "UP,&#xD;
my lads, and heaVe the anchor."&#xD;
A portion' of t~ sailors, u~jder the direc-&#xD;
ti~n of the second mate, pro~~ded to raise&#xD;
the anchor, and the remaind~"~uided by Mr.&#xD;
Williaiils, to unfurl a sail.&#xD;
The noise of the capstan soon attracted&#xD;
the notice of others of the inhabitants of Sai~&#xD;
tiago, and before the labor was half done,&#xD;
some fifteen or twei~ty had assembled on the&#xD;
north shore opposite, near the spot where&#xD;
Pecosta stood when he and the skipper were&#xD;
engaged in conversation.&#xD;
A few'minutesafter, Pecosta, gliding along&#xD;
with ~e current in a li~ht canoe, approached&#xD;
the b&amp;amp;w of the' vess~I unperceived; for al-&#xD;
thoi~gh the da~ had b~gun to' break, the ship -&#xD;
lay so directly between him and the east,&#xD;
that he'wa5 within a boat's leu~th of the stem&#xD;

approach.&#xD;
"Captain," continued the Mexican, pull&#xD;
ing his canoe alongside of the schooner, "I&#xD;
am astOni5hCd to find Ton w~ighiing anchor at&#xD;
a time when an attempt to go over the bar&#xD;
will be certain destruction."'&#xD;
"I do not intend to destroy my vessel by&#xD;
the rash step you regard as the cons~qtience&#xD;
of a necessary preparation," replied Captain&#xD;
Leonard; I axil only getting ready te avail&#xD;
myself of the flow, ~t6 clear the bar without&#xD;
injury."&#xD;
"But five hours must elapse before the&#xD;
tide will be high enough to carry you over&#xD;
in safety," returned PecOsta, "and meantime&#xD;
if the anchor is taken up, your vessel will be&#xD;

These last words were expressed with a&#xD;
firmness that clearly evinced' his determina-&#xD;
ilon and were followed by increased exertion,&#xD;
which soon curried the little canoe beyond&#xD;
vision of those on board the schooner.&#xD;
"Mr. Williams, " said the Captain as boon&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
In the.meanwhile the sailors, under the ex~&#xD;
citement of fear, redoubled their exertions to&#xD;
place themselves beyond the reach ofdanger.&#xD;
Round and round they turned the capstan,&#xD;
link by link they shortened the chain that&#xD;
supported the anchor; but time progressed&#xD;
as well as their labors. Much was yet to&#xD;
be accomplished when the sun like a great&#xD;
ball of fire, began to rise above the level of&#xD;
the sea, and spread its golden beams over&#xD;
l~d ai~d water. And the orb of day waa&#xD;
b partially visible when Pecosta's oanoe,&#xD;
shooting around a projecting angle in the&#xD;
bank, appeared in full view in the stream.&#xD;
"Heave away, lads," cried Captain Leon-&#xD;
ard, to the men at the capstan. Then turn-&#xD;
ing to his mate, he continued, "Mr. Wil-&#xD;
liams, the old devil is coming again, ~and&#xD;
&#xD;

looks like a woman."&#xD;
The descent of the canoe was like a streak&#xD;
of light, so short a time~e~apsed from its first&#xD;
appearance until it touched the side of the&#xD;
schooner.&#xD;
"I admire the promptness with which you&#xD;
meet your business engagements," said Cap-&#xD;
tain Leonard, with a flattering smile.&#xD;
"But you must not infer from my expedi-&#xD;

by a detachment of Mexican soldiers, or at&#xD;

of the Army of Occupation, they command&#xD;
a price considerably beyond what you were&#xD;
charged. But it is less trouble to. sell at&#xD;
one's own door as it were, and I hurried lest&#xD;
you would be beyond the mouth of the river,&#xD;
when I should not like to venture my little&#xD;
canoe, and whence you might have thought&#xD;
it too much trouble to disphich a boat to&#xD;
meet me at a point of safety."&#xD;
"You think less of my honor than I do&#xD;
myself," replied Captain Leonard. "Not&#xD;
for one moment. should I have considered&#xD;
the trouble against a breach of my engage-&#xD;
ment. Besides" he added, glancing at the&#xD;
young lady who occupied a seat in the stern&#xD;
of the canoe, "a sunlight view of so sweet a&#xD;
countenance would have amply rewarded&#xD;
me for a greater venture, without the vege-&#xD;
tables."&#xD;
"This is my daughter," said Pecosta.&#xD;
"But, sir, do not~ be surprised; a rose may&#xD;
grow in a peasant's garden as welL as in a&#xD;
lord's, and if it receives less culture, may&#xD;
possess no less fragrance. Olinda is a dair~-&#xD;
t~y thing, if she is uncultivated."&#xD;
To which Captain Leonard replied~ raising&#xD;
his Panama and bowing to the young lady,&#xD;
who returned his salute with a slight incli-&#xD;
nation of the head, "I shall feel myself highly&#xD;
honored if you and your pretty daughter will&#xD;
step aboard my vessel and taste glass of my&#xD;
wine. It has travelled with me from France&#xD;
the country of its manuta~ture, and is none&#xD;
the worse for being unadulterated."&#xD;
"it is very seldom I indulge in vinous be.&#xD;

averages of any kind.-..my daughter never,'&#xD;
replied Pecosta. "As our pursuits are hum.&#xD;
ble, our habits of life are simple and our diet&#xD;
frugal."&#xD;
"If the lady's rosy lips but touch the rosy&#xD;
wine," returned the captain, "I shall be satis-&#xD;
fled."&#xD;
"Do not urge my darling," said the Mexi-.&#xD;
can, "I shall drink enough for both father&#xD;
and daughter."&#xD;
"That will suffice," said Captain Leonard&#xD;
with a smile, "if the daughter beats the father&#xD;
company."&#xD;
"To manifest their good will, it is far&#xD;
from necessary that either should enter your&#xD;
vessel," retukiied Pecosta; "nevertheless, that&#xD;
you may not esteem me churlish, I will sht~re&#xD;
with you the contents of your bottle in your&#xD;
own cabin."&#xD;
As soon as the second cargo of vegetables&#xD;
was transferred from the canoe, a rope ladder&#xD;
was thrown over the starboard side of the&#xD;
schooner, and Pecosta received on board.&#xD;
Olindawith her blushing face averted from&#xD;
the rude gaze of the sailors retained her seat&#xD;
in the stern of her father's little boat.&#xD;
Captain Leonard received hiaguest with&#xD;
out.~tretched hand, and conducted him to his&#xD;
cabin. From a small closet hetook a bottle&#xD;
of wine, and filling a brace of tumblers that&#xD;
stood on the table, presented one to Pecosta.&#xD;
The other he took in his own hand, and look-&#xD;
ing steadfastly into the face of 'her father,&#xD;
simply uttered the name of Olinda.&#xD;
Pecosta returned the look with a tearfut&#xD;
eye, and swallowed the contents of his tum-&#xD;
bler at a single dranght, to indicate that his&#xD;
daughter's happiness, compared with all&#xD;
things else together, was as the flowing gob-&#xD;
blet to the dregs that settle at the bottom.&#xD;
Captain Leonard in the most courteous&#xD;
manner, imitated the example of the affec-&#xD;
tionate parent,. and immediately refilled the&#xD;
glasses; but Pecosta decline~1 &amp;amp;second indul-&#xD;
gence, assuringg him that the large quantity&#xD;
he had already imbibed, owing to his abste.&#xD;

Pecosta signified his assent with a short&#xD;
nod, and Captain Leonard, carefully closing&#xD;
the door of the cabin, ascended the' Stairs to&#xD;
the uppermost deck, from which he accosted&#xD;
Ohinda~&#xD;
"Beantihil maiden!" said he, "it is your&#xD;

cabin of my vessel without delay. Run&#xD;

"AhAost the la~t thing - my father said in&#xD;

"I m!Bt have it from his own lips," axis-&#xD;

'"There are conditions in which a man is&#xD;
unable to express his though~," returned&#xD;
Captain Leonard.&#xD;
"While reason controls the man, he can&#xD;
control his tongue," replied Olinda.&#xD;
"Wine will thicken a man's tongue before&#xD;
it will muddy his brain," said the Captain.&#xD;
'2~'ew men are so abstemious as my father."&#xD;
returned the damsel, in-a tone of slight re&#xD;
preach; and if he has become intoxicated in&#xD;
the short time that has, eIapsedsi~xce he left&#xD;
this canoe, you have adniinistered semethiig&#xD;
more potent than wine,"&#xD;
"And suppose I have," returned Captain&#xD;
Leonard, "would you allow him to suffer for&#xD;
whut of your presence and care?"&#xD;
"If the ft~ther has suffered treachery and&#xD;
wrong at your hand, the daughter could not&#xD;
hope to fare better," said Olinda.&#xD;
"But if he has snfl~red no injury?" persist&#xD;
ted the Captain.&#xD;
"Then my presence is not needed;" an~&#xD;
swerved the maiden.&#xD;
- Captain Leonard, not knowing how to&#xD;
meet h~r objections, returiled to the cabin,&#xD;
and repeated to Pecosta the language of his&#xD;
daughter, a~d passed a suitable encomium&#xD;
upon her for her quick-witted replies.&#xD;
"I will not~ bid niy daughter come aboard&#xD;
your vesSel," replied the Mexican; "I wiU&#xD;
explain to her 'my unpi~~ ~it situati6u, and&#xD;
leave her to act her own pleasure." -&#xD;
"That will suuilce," said the Captain. "~Fil~&#xD;
ml love will bring her'W your si4e, and that&#xD;
mall I desire."&#xD;
He then returned to the deck, acconipan.&#xD;

ful vo~ee; "Olinda, my dai'lin~, i~ ant here a&#xD;

But these words had not the effect Cap-&#xD;

&#xD;
river till within a few yards of the bank,&#xD;
where it was turned up the stream. As she&#xD;
elided by those on the shore, she spoke a&#xD;
few hasty words, which produced an instan-&#xD;
taneous excitement, that in a few minutes&#xD;
was visible to all on board. When she reach-&#xD;
ed the projecting angle before mentioned,&#xD;
she looked back on the schooner, and seeing&#xD;
her father leaning on the gunwale with his&#xD;
eyes bent on her, waived the paddle above&#xD;
her head, and the next moment 'disappeared.&#xD;
CHAPTER III.&#xD;
N~w the necessity for increased exertion&#xD;
on the part of the sailors was greatly enhan-&#xD;
ed, for although the maiden was ignorant of&#xD;
thetrue character of the vessel, yet she was&#xD;
too well assured of the facCthat~er father&#xD;
was therein a prisoner. From those on shore&#xD;
there was obviously nothing to apprehend, for&#xD;
beside a large quantity of vociferous talk,&#xD;
there was rio evidence that the fact had come&#xD;
to their knowledge. Captain Leonard was&#xD;
unable to account for this inactivity, on any&#xD;
other than the following hypothesis; It was&#xD;
his opinion, which he expressed to Pecosta&#xD;
at well as his crew, that they were made ac-&#xD;
quainted with the intentions of the maiden,&#xD;
who had gone to apprise some garrison ~&#xD;
other body of soldiers, of her father's im-&#xD;
prisonment, to procure their assistance to&#xD;
effect his liberation.&#xD;
"I am not at all surprised at the deport-&#xD;
ment of those on shore," replied Pecosta,&#xD;
when Captain Leonard inquired the cause&#xD;
of their inactivity. "They have no interest&#xD;
in my welfare, for I am a stranger among&#xD;
them. I came hither from Texas, and they&#xD;
regard me as a fugitive from justice.' They&#xD;
m~y term your act a daring outrage or a&#xD;
'villianous treachery, arid shower upon your&#xD;
head curses innumerable, and yet j know&#xD;
they secretly rejoice that I am here a pris-&#xD;
oner."&#xD;
"But the same cannot be said of your&#xD;
daughter, who ha~ gone to summon the sol.&#xD;
diers to her assistance?" said Cartain Leon-&#xD;
and.&#xD;
"You greatly mistake the chb:acter of my&#xD;
&#xD;
darling," returned the Me~icari. "She is not&#xD;
a heroine. On the contrary, she is timid as&#xD;
a fawn, and starts 4 the approach ~of danger&#xD;
as she fled from the presence of her father's&#xD;
imprisoner."&#xD;
"Answer me, and answer me truly, "said&#xD;
Captain Leonard, with an air of authority,&#xD;
"is there a Mexican garrison at Santiago?"&#xD;
"There is none within the disputed territo-&#xD;
ry," replied Pecosta, "except the small de-&#xD;
tachment at Point Isabel, before men-&#xD;
tioned."&#xD;
"Only two weeks ago," returned Captain&#xD;
Leonard, 'all the coast country lying between&#xD;
the Rk Grande aiid the Nueces, was filled&#xD;
with straggling bands of cavalry, belonging&#xD;
to the regiments under the command of&#xD;
Canales and Minon?"&#xD;
"But since then." replied the Mexican,&#xD;
"they have been collected together, and are&#xD;
now at Matamoras waiting the arrival of&#xD;
General Anista, who is entrusted with the&#xD;
chief command."&#xD;
During thisconversation, Pecosta leaned&#xD;
upon the gunwale of the schooner, with his&#xD;
eyes intently turned towards the north. But&#xD;
his gaze did not escape the observation ~&#xD;
Captain Leonard, who repeatedly looked in&#xD;
the same direction, concluded, as he could&#xD;
discern nothing unusual, that succor was ez~&#xD;
pected from Point Isabel. 'Under the influ-&#xD;
ence of this opinion he urged his men to still&#xD;
.greater efforts, and expressed the confident&#xD;
b~llef that themaiden had gone to summon&#xD;
the Me~icansoldiery, mom whom they could.&#xD;
expect nothing but robbery and death.&#xD;
Stimulated to more vigorous exertion&#xD;
by the increased apprehension, the seamen&#xD;
soon brought the anchor home, and spread&#xD;
the great three-cornered sail to catch the&#xD;
gentle wind that was to bear them to a point&#xD;
of safety.&#xD;
When the prow of the vessel was turned&#xD;
towards the gulf, the Mexican shifted his&#xD;
position to the opposite side, and cur uued&#xD;
to gaze toward the north. Again ~aptaiu&#xD;
Leonard looked in the same direction, and al-&#xD;
though nothing appeared to support the opin.&#xD;
ion already mentioned, he was more firmly&#xD;
convinced of its truth, as the singular' beha-&#xD;
vior of the Mexican 'was otherwise iriexplicav&#xD;
&#xD;
Is. ~ut as they were passing beyond the&#xD;
eaci of danger, he regarded it as a matter&#xD;
C small importance-scarcely worthy of con-&#xD;
ideration.&#xD;
"And is it the design of your govern~&#xD;
ient," said he, resuming conversation with&#xD;
costat, "to fight for the little strip of bar-&#xD;
~n land lying between these rivers?"&#xD;
"Most assuredly," answered the Mexican,&#xD;
rith emphasis. "And it expects to blot out&#xD;
is only evidences of title which the Amen-&#xD;
ins have, with the blood of their mercenary&#xD;
ddiers."&#xD;
"You have a mistaken notion of our&#xD;
tiny," returned Captain Leonard. "Our&#xD;
~ldiers do not fight for money, but for the&#xD;
orion of their country."&#xD;
"Are those native Americans who Corn-&#xD;
rise the 4.rmy of Occupation?" inquired&#xD;
~costa. "I do not mean the officers, for&#xD;
icy are of course, but the rank and file!"&#xD;
"It must be confessed that many of those&#xD;
e foreigners," replied the American; "but&#xD;
military service is as much their vocation as&#xD;
~rdening is yours, and they pursue it for&#xD;
is same purpose-a livelihood."&#xD;
"That is to say," returned the Mexican,&#xD;
hey fight for money."'&#xD;
"It is one thing," returned the Captain,&#xD;
o engage in military pursuits as a busi-&#xD;
iss, and quite another, as you very well&#xD;
aow, to engage services for a particular oc-&#xD;
isbn and consideration."&#xD;
"Th~re is certainly a difference," said Fe-&#xD;
)stalvith a sneer, "and there is also a dif-&#xD;
rence between tweedle-dum and tweedle-&#xD;
is.',&#xD;
"It is of little consequence to our govern-&#xD;
out," said Captain Leonard~ "whether a&#xD;
idier be a native or a foreigner; success is&#xD;
is groat desideratum."&#xD;
"Yes," said Pecosta, with another look of&#xD;
sdain, "and that will account for the great&#xD;
umber of foreigners which are to be found in&#xD;
ur army. Your government is too ambi-&#xD;
)us to engage in a war of invasion and con-&#xD;
uest without the hope of success, and in the&#xD;
ssent case there is reason to believe that&#xD;
us hope is based upon the prowess of her&#xD;
risk soldiery."&#xD;
"You cannot have abigher opinion of Irish&#xD;
&#xD;
intrepidity than I already entertain," return-&#xD;
ed Captain Leonard, "so that subject admits&#xD;
of no discussion on the present occasion; of&#xD;
American bravery I have only to eay, that&#xD;
the history of the past furnishes abundant&#xD;
proof of its superiority, and supercedes the&#xD;
necessity of particularity."&#xD;
"You have reason to vaunt," said Pecosta.&#xD;
"Your arms have been many times victorious.&#xD;
But as yet you have only met the aborigines&#xD;
of the wilderness, whose wooden bows and&#xD;
flint pointed arrows avail but little in a strife&#xD;
where lead and steel are used against them;&#xD;
and the English, who are only in&amp;amp;imitabla&#xD;
when they encounter the effeminate inhabit.&#xD;
ante of the Eastern Hemisphere."&#xD;
"You are not so young as to have never&#xD;
heard, nor so old as to have forgotten, the&#xD;
battle of San Jacinto, where General Lions.&#xD;
ton, a native of America, with a small body&#xD;
of American 'troops, met the flower of the&#xD;
Mexican army, under the command of its&#xD;
most distinguished Captain, and against a&#xD;
very great odds obtained a most eounplet.i&#xD;
victory, and made the General in chief of'the&#xD;
discomlited army a prisoner of war. You&#xD;
must have heard of that engagement?" said&#xD;
Captain Leonard, with a smile of triumph.&#xD;
A shade passed over the dark features eA~&#xD;
Pecosta, but he made no reply. His eyes&#xD;
were still turned in the direction before men-&#xD;
tioned, but the shore, the chapperal, the trees&#xD;
and the sky, were all that were visible;&#xD;
For a moment Captain Leonard regarded&#xD;
him with attention. He was of the medium&#xD;
height, slender, and slightly stoop-shouldered..&#xD;
His features, like his person, were meagre,&#xD;
and his complexion a chesxu~t-brown. His&#xD;
eyes were large, black of course, brilliant,&#xD;
and very expressive. He was clad in a suit&#xD;
of coarse gray cloth, and over his shoulders&#xD;
his hand thrust through the centre, hung a&#xD;
blanket of inferior quality, such as are usu-&#xD;
ally worn by the poorer classes of that coun-&#xD;
try.&#xD;
But in the midst of his observation, Mr.&#xD;
Williams claimed his attention. The vemel&#xD;
had passed out of the river, and was rapidly&#xD;
approaching the bar, which-it should have&#xD;
been mentioned before-surrounds the gulf~&#xD;
and greatly obstructs navigation. The depth&#xD;

river, and he was totally ignoait of his pre..&#xD;
cise situation. 'Besides, h~ Wa~ mit at all&#xD;
certain that there was tnor6 wat~r than the&#xD;
Mexican had represented while his vemel&#xD;
was drawing nearly six feet. Under them&#xD;
cireutnstances it became necessary to drop'&#xD;
anchor, launch a boat, and rely' upon the in-&#xD;
dications of the plumit.&#xD;
Accordingly, the abchor ~as unloosed&#xD;
from its fastenings and a boat lowered to the&#xD;
water, and manned with sailors under the su-&#xD;
perintendency of Mi'.' Williams, who mana-&#xD;
ged the rudder, while another of the crew&#xD;
cast the leadand noted the depth of the wa~&#xD;
ter.&#xD;
Almost inimedlately,'Pecosta left the plate&#xD;
he had occupied during the vessel's descent,&#xD;
and joined Captain Leonard; who stood at&#xD;
&#xD;
old mail by the throat, aid hurling him is&#xD;
the deck with great violence. Then calling&#xD;
through his trumn~et, he ordered Mr. Wil.&#xD;
iams to return to the vessel immediately.&#xD;
By this time a company of musketeers,&#xD;
some forty in number, appeared in'the dis.&#xD;
tance, and in a few minutes after at the top&#xD;
of their horse's speed, dashed down to the&#xD;
very water's edge.&#xD;
Here they formed themselves into a line,&#xD;
and the officer in command detnanded of&#xD;
Captain Le6nard, in a very peremptory&#xD;
manner, an immediate liberation of his&#xD;
cotifitryman, threatenfug the destruction of&#xD;
both vessel'and' crew it' he refused. Captain&#xD;
Leonard replied that as soon as his boat re.&#xD;
turned he would comply with his req~test.&#xD;
Hereupon Pecosta called to the commander&#xD;
of the soldiers, to dispatch the citizens for&#xD;
their canoes and come and take the vessel&#xD;
which was an American transport, loaded&#xD;
with provisions for the Army of Occapati9n.&#xD;
I~~ accordance with the direction ol OS.&#xD;

divided into two sections, and formed at the&#xD;
shore of the river, ready to step Into the&#xD;

return, but the fear of his superior was as&#xD;
nothing to everything, compared with his&#xD;
fear of the Mexicans.&#xD;
Deserted by much the larger portion of&#xD;
his crew, Captain Leonard turned ~o the re-&#xD;
mainder, and said to them, that as they had&#xD;
shipped with him to labor and ant to fight,&#xD;
he would not control their movements in thin&#xD;
emergency.&#xD;
"Yet," be added, with energy and deter-&#xD;
mination, "if bat one of you will remain, I&#xD;
will fight till the last drop of blood oozes&#xD;
from inyveins before I will surrender; but if&#xD;
you prefer, you may follow the example of&#xD;
your cowardly inesmates."&#xD;
Very much to the surprise of Captain&#xD;
Leonard, who hope~I to be able ~o defend his&#xD;
vessel against the attack of the musketeers,&#xD;
the remainder of the crew, regardless of the&#xD;
shame attached to their ignominious flight;&#xD;
immediately launched the other boat, jumped&#xD;
aboard, an~d struck out toward the shore&#xD;
which their terrified fellows had akeady~&#xD;
reached, leaving him with none in the vessel&#xD;
but the Mexican, and without the means of&#xD;
escape.&#xD;
The musketeers who were descending the&#xD;
south bank of the river, observing the flight&#xD;
of this portion of the crew, started in pursuit,&#xD;
and running between them and the shore forc-&#xD;
ed them out to sea. For nearly an hour their&#xD;
little boat was visible, and then it entirely&#xD;
disappeared and was never heard of after-&#xD;
wards,&#xD;

THE MEXICAi~&#xD;
&#xD;
Leonard, "tnat I could so tkr lose control of&#xD;
my temper as to lift my hand against an old&#xD;
man, and he a prisoner."&#xD;
"~nough," said Pecosta; and he turned&#xD;
about immediately and cried," Stand back,&#xD;
men," waving his hands to the soldiers, who&#xD;
were surprised at his interference, and&#xD;
still more at his authoritative demeanour~&#xD;
"By what right doyou interrupt our pl~a-&#xD;
sures?" demanded the lieutenant drawing his&#xD;
sword' over the head of the old man "Away,&#xD;
thou scum of the republic, or I will sever&#xD;
your hcad from your body, and give your&#xD;
carcase to t~ie dogs."&#xD;
"To you, Captain Jose Peron, I appeal for&#xD;
clemency on behalf of this helpless prisoner,"&#xD;
cried Pecosta, turning to the officer in com-&#xD;
mand.&#xD;
"Captain Peron," said the lieutenant,&#xD;
"grant not this captive's llfe, lest we quar-&#xD;
rel, for I say he shall die."&#xD;
"First let me hear the reason for this re-&#xD;
quest," said 'Captain Peron.. "It may be&#xD;
such as will juetiI~y his preservation."&#xD;
"Speak out, old man," said the lieutenant,&#xD;
~nd let ue know what reason you can assign&#xD;
f'r this unwarrantable 'piece of interfer-&#xD;
.ace?" V&#xD;
"I have a reason," replied Pecosta, with&#xD;
a dignity of manner that abashed thelienten-&#xD;
ant; "but it is only for the ears of Captain&#xD;
J'erou."&#xD;
"Mr. Muffles," said the commander, ad-&#xD;
dressing his lieutenant, "yon will see that&#xD;
no harm befalls this man in my absence."&#xD;
He then joined Pecosta, who had drawn a&#xD;
few paces apart that they might converse un-&#xD;
heard.&#xD;
"Who is that man who has dared to con.&#xD;
trol our actions-to interrupt our pleasures?"&#xD;
demanded the lieutenant of one of the citi-&#xD;
zone.&#xD;
"I don't how," replied the man addressed&#xD;
"He tame here a few days ago, but~where&#xD;
from Idon't know. He dresses like the peo-&#xD;
ple of 8antiago, but he talks different. It Is&#xD;
the general opinion that he isn't what he ap..&#xD;
pears to be, but who he is I don't know."&#xD;
"And I dent know," said the lieutenant,&#xD;
"and, I don't care. One thing I do know;&#xD;
ioweyer, that this nhnil shall die or Jose Fe-&#xD;
&#xD;
l~IDE; OR,&#xD;
ron shall never be a major." Drawing a line&#xD;
upon the ground with his sword, as Pizarro&#xD;
did on another occasion, lie added, "Those&#xD;
of you who are id favor of the prisoner's&#xD;
death will join the side of Pedro Muffles."&#xD;
A ehort ~time before all the soldiers wore&#xD;
intoxicated, and the nausea occasioned by&#xD;
the sea had but partially sobered them. In&#xD;
this half drunken condition, the anger of their&#xD;
lieutenant found a ready ~sympathy in their&#xD;
bosoms, and without an exception they cross-&#xD;
ed over the line which he had drawn upon the&#xD;
ground~and swore that mortal man should&#xD;
not deprive them of their vengeance.&#xD;
In the meanwhile the following conversa-&#xD;
tion took place between Pecosta and Cap.&#xD;
tam Peron.&#xD;
"The time has at length come," said the&#xD;
former, "when an act of mercy may discharge&#xD;
a debt of gratitude. To preserve tbe life&#xD;
you villains seek to destroy, will be an act of&#xD;
justice that may subserve both our interests.&#xD;
At least, nothing can be gained by his death.&#xD;
"I am not insensible of my obligations to&#xD;
you or unmindful of the many servicOs receiv-&#xD;
ed at your hands," returned Captain Peron,&#xD;
"but if Muffles is resolved upon that man's&#xD;
death, I must submit to lose his influence,&#xD;
without which I shall be defeated."&#xD;
"The influence of Pedro Muffles might&#xD;
have been essential to the election of Captain&#xD;
Peron," replied Pecosta; "but Captain Pe.&#xD;
ron the captor, stands in need of no such as-&#xD;
sistance. His name will be trumpeted&#xD;
throughout the republic. All men will speak&#xD;
in his praise. flis enemies will not dare to&#xD;
open their mouths."&#xD;
"And suppose all these things should come&#xD;
to pass, and they are a great deal more than&#xD;
I expect, what difference can the preserva-&#xD;
tion of this man's life produce?" inquired&#xD;
th~ officer.&#xD;
"tie is a citizen of the U~ States-.-the&#xD;
greatest republic upon the face of the earth,&#xD;
and the master of one of his government's&#xD;
transports, replied Pecosta; "and leaving tue&#xD;
promptings of humanity and the rights of&#xD;
the captive wholly out of 'the consideration,&#xD;
your own country, to say nothing of other&#xD;
nations, will no more forgive the death of&#xD;
&#xD;
Ti~E RANGES REVENGE.              18&#xD;
&#xD;
a4 prisoner, than it would the destruction&#xD;
otyonder prize."&#xD;
"I cannot perceive the importance of this&#xD;
mnan'spreservation,"returned the officer. "The&#xD;
prime is valuable, because both vessel and&#xD;
cargo are useful; the former will increase our&#xD;
navy, which is none too large, and the latter&#xD;
will support our army, which is none too&#xD;
well fed."&#xD;
"But of what value is the prize compared&#xD;
with the life of a human. being?" inquired&#xD;
Pecosta.&#xD;
"It Is worth a thousand such as this man's,"&#xD;
replied the Captain.&#xD;
"1 speak not of the life of an American&#xD;
but of a Mexican," said Pecosta.&#xD;
'1 cannot see what the life of a Mexican&#xD;
haste do with the matter," returned Captain&#xD;
Feron. "To preserve one of my country-&#xD;
men, if he was a worthy man, I would save&#xD;
or destroy a dozen such lives, and sacrifice&#xD;
a score of such prizes."&#xD;
"Very good," said Pecosta. "If General&#xD;
Arista was a prisoner of war and in the&#xD;
hands of the enemy, would a hundred such&#xD;
prizes procure his liberation? Would a doz-&#xD;
en such secure the freedom of the meanest&#xD;
private in our ranks? And yet, this man&#xD;
would be received in exchange for any com~&#xD;
mon soldier, perhaps for any officer whose&#xD;
rank was not above your own. Do you now&#xD;
see the importanoet"&#xD;
~'Viewing the matter in that light," said&#xD;
the officer, "it is of some consequence; never-&#xD;
theless, I will not anticipate such a contin-&#xD;
gency."&#xD;
"The fortunes of war," returned the elder,-&#xD;
"is a proverbial expression, and like all' pro-&#xD;
'verbs, its truth has been established by time&#xD;
and experience. Ten years have not yet&#xD;
elapsed since the flower of our army was de-&#xD;
feated at San Francisco, and the commander&#xD;
In chief made a prisoner. It was these very&#xD;
people wh~ were then our conquerors; and&#xD;
Arista may experience the fate of Santa An-&#xD;
an"&#xD;
"In this opinion we widely differ," saidthe&#xD;
young man. "I believe we shall be conquer-&#xD;
era, pd 'more than conquerors; you imagine&#xD;
that Arista will be repulsed, and consequent-&#xD;
&#xD;
ly disgraced, and that Santa &amp;amp;nna will be&#xD;
~recalled from his banishment and placed at&#xD;
the head of the army."&#xD;
"I do sincerely believe~that all these&#xD;
things will occur," replied Pecosta. "And&#xD;
if they should, all the officers who enter th~&#xD;
field with the defeated general, will. share his&#xD;
disgrace. If Ayista sinks in the estimation&#xD;
of his co~rntry, Jose Peron will sink with&#xD;
him, unless he is fortunate enough to secure&#xD;
a broken mast to rest upon. If Santa An-&#xD;
na is recalled, Lopez Pecosta will doff his&#xD;
peasant'sgarbfor his counsel will then be re-&#xD;
quired. And then, if the captorhas notst~ined&#xD;
his hands with the blood c~f innocence, and&#xD;
covered his memory with eternal infamythe&#xD;
exiled secretary may do him a greater service&#xD;
than Pedro Muffles and all his friends could&#xD;
accomplish."&#xD;
"Allow me to quote another proverb," re-&#xD;
turned the officer. "A bird in the hand is&#xD;
worth t*o in the bush. The certainty of a&#xD;
majority is to be preferred to the merepossi-&#xD;
bihity of a colonelship."&#xD;
"But Irepeat," said Pecosta, impatiently.&#xD;
'that if Arista should be-defeated, Captain&#xD;
Peron will share his disgrace. As the eap-&#xD;
tor of a valuable prize and the first prisoner&#xD;
of war, his name will become notorious, and&#xD;
if that prize and prisoner are surrendered&#xD;
to the government without injury, his fame&#xD;
will not exceed his country's praise. Send&#xD;
this man to Arista in my charge. and there&#xD;
will then be one at head quarters to urge your&#xD;
claims."&#xD;
"And suppose Anita should see through&#xD;
your disguise?"~inquired the officer. "Your&#xD;
life is a forfeit the moment you set foot upon&#xD;
Mexican soil."&#xD;
"I care not if it seals my doom," replied&#xD;
Pecos)a. "I will no longer no a wandered.&#xD;
I would rather have a grave in the land of&#xD;
my birth, than a home in any I have visited.&#xD;
I have been dispossessed, disfranchised, ban-&#xD;
ished; I may yet be executed; but I must die&#xD;
in my own country, If for that country I die&#xD;
a sacrifice."&#xD;
"I will do what I can," said the officer~&#xD;
"You can do all I ask," returned Pecoata&#xD;
Thus the conversatl~n ended, and the&#xD;
twain retraced, their steps in silence. Cap.&#xD;

in reference to Santa Anna was not mentions.&#xD;

bad a short private conference, which resul-&#xD;
ted in a satisfactory understanding. The lat-&#xD;
tsr, with his party, immediately set out upon&#xD;
their expedition, crossing the river in the&#xD;
boats of the natives, and causing their horses&#xD;
to swim by their sides.&#xD;
An hour afterwards, Pecosta accompa-&#xD;
nied by his daughter and four or five of the&#xD;
citizens of Santiago, the latter as a guard,&#xD;
started for Matamoras. They were moun-&#xD;
ted on mules, except the ppsoner, who was&#xD;
seated on a donkey, with hi~ hands tied to-&#xD;
gether behind him, and his feet tied under&#xD;
the beast's belly. A. rope was fastened at&#xD;
one end to the bit of the bridle, and the oth-&#xD;
er was held in the hand of one of the guards.&#xD;
It was about ten o'clock when they com-&#xD;
aenced their journey, a distance of some&#xD;
thirty miles. They proceeded up the river&#xD;
until they reached a point opposite Burita,&#xD;
at which there was a kind of ferry, where&#xD;
they crossed to the Mexican side of the nv-&#xD;
or.&#xD;
Xn this village they stopped and baited&#xD;
their horses and dined themselves. After&#xD;
dinner they resumed their course, at a brisk&#xD;
trot, that they might, as Pecosta said, reach&#xD;
the city before the out-guards were stationed&#xD;
for the night; but in reality because he feared&#xD;
some treachery on the part of Pedro Muffles.&#xD;
In this manner they were jogging along&#xD;
three or four miles from the city, when a&#xD;
young man, mounted on a coal-black Mus-&#xD;
tang pony, and dashing along at a reckless&#xD;
speed, as he passed bya thicket that concealed&#xD;
the road in advance of the party, suddenly&#xD;
appeared in their midst, and ran with such&#xD;
force against the mule upon which Olinda&#xD;
wan riding, that she was thrown from her&#xD;
Ntj and but f~r his presence of mind and su-&#xD;
perior horsemanship, she would probably&#xD;
2&#xD;
&#xD;
have been allied. As it was, he caught her&#xD;
falling, and with a swing, assisted by-the mo-&#xD;
tion of his horse, raised her to his withers,&#xD;
and immediately after dismounted and lifted&#xD;
her to the ground.&#xD;
The excitement occasioned by the collision&#xD;
was sudden a$ extreme, but it lasted only&#xD;
for a few teoments. (flinda, who was at first&#xD;
very much excited and frightened, soon r.~-&#xD;
covered her spirits, and her father, instead of&#xD;
reproaching the young man for his heedless-&#xD;
ness, thanked him for his service.&#xD;
The voice of the parent caused the young&#xD;
man to lift his eyes from the beautiful face&#xD;
of Olinda, and notwvhsmnding the disguise&#xD;
which so effectually deceived others, he in-&#xD;
stantly recognized the er-secretary.&#xD;
"Rodainont!" he exclaimed, with a look&#xD;
and gesture of surprise.&#xD;
At the sound af this name, which they has&#xD;
not heard pronounced for months, both fatbei&#xD;
and daughter started, for the young man wa-&#xD;
a stranger.         -&#xD;
"It was in my father's house," said tb~&#xD;
youth, observing their surprise and hasten~&#xD;
ing to explain, '~that you were for a montI~&#xD;
concealed to escape the emisaries of Santa&#xD;
Anna's successor, who were charged wlib~&#xD;
your secret execution."&#xD;
"Alphonso MartelIaI" cried the old man,.&#xD;
throwing his arms around the youth, au4'&#xD;
embracing him with an affection almost pa-&#xD;
rental; "my dear, dear boy, are your parents&#xD;
well?"&#xD;
"They are," replied Alphonsd, "and are?&#xD;
at present in Matamoras, where they have&#xD;
been living for some months past.. 'lliey of.."&#xD;
ten speak of you, and will be rejoiced to see&#xD;
you again, even in the peasant's garb that'~&#xD;
enabled you to elude your pursuers."&#xD;
"Olinda," said the elder, adr.lressing his' '&#xD;
daughter, "this is the youn~man of Whom&#xD;
you have so often heard rue speak. Alphon..&#xD;
so," he addedturning to the youth, '1this is&#xD;
my daughter."&#xD;
Martella stepped forward and took the&#xD;
maiden's dainty little hand in his own, with&#xD;
such a warmth as friends manifest who.&#xD;
have been a long time separated; and he ut~&#xD;
tered words, scarce above a whisper, that'&#xD;
brought the color to her cheeks, still ~&#xD;

dozen men, riding with the utmost hurry and&#xD;
confusion, and shouting like as many de-&#xD;
mnons.&#xD;
~'It is Pedro Muffles, coming to take the&#xD;
prisoner with wl~ose custody I am charged,"&#xD;
said Peco~ta.&#xD;
uWhat does he want with the prisoner?"&#xD;
inquired A.lphonso.&#xD;
A'I4~ wishes to make him a frast for the&#xD;
bloodhounds that howl at his heels," replied&amp;amp;&#xD;
Pecosta.&#xD;
"Who is this man, and what is his crime?"&#xD;
continued Alphonse, alluding to Captaiit&#xD;
Leonard.&#xD;
"Re is the commander of an Auterican'&#xD;
transport, whorun his vessel lnt~ the river.&#xD;
during last night for sheitter, and was thia&#xD;
morning captured by. Captain Peron, of Mi.&#xD;
nor's musketeers," answered 'Pecosta.&#xD;
"And would Lieutenant Muffles kill a&#xD;
prisoner ofwar?"aaked Alphonse, surprised.&#xD;
"He would have done so this morning but.&#xD;
for my interference and Peron's authority,'?&#xD;
replied Pecosta; "and now I fear he has fob&#xD;
lowed us for the same purpose."&#xD;
"It must not be permitted," said Martella,&#xD;
courageously. "I3ut I have n~ weapon."&#xD;
"Jilere is a pistol,'? said Pecosta, handing&#xD;
him one of Allen~s revolvers, which he had&#xD;
procured in New Orleans while a sojoarner:~&#xD;
in that city. "-You have only to aim and&#xD;
pulL"&#xD;
Scarcely had the youth possessed hiutself~&#xD;
of the weapon, when the pursuing party,&#xD;
rushing by them like a tornado, siesed the&#xD;
rope attached to the hit ofOaptain Leonard'.&#xD;
donkey, andendea~ored to carry offth&amp;amp;pris-&#xD;
oner by eight.' Bat the stubborn bewV&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RANGER'S UEVE~TWI.&#xD;
&#xD;
which had travelled well enough before, re-&#xD;
fused to move a toot, except to kick at those&#xD;
'who tried to urge it forward&#xD;
Deeply chagrined on account of his fail-&#xD;
ure, and enraged withall, Muffles turned tp&#xD;
?e~osta, and said, "I wouldn't stop a picky&#xD;
synne to have a dozen bullet holes through&#xD;
your hide for your meddlesomeness this merit.&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
"I had really hoped" returned Pecotta,&#xD;
"that when you left nswe should nOt again&#xD;
be pained and troubled with your presence."&#xD;
"blo insolei~ce, you old devil," said' Muf-&#xD;
fles, menacingly, "or 'i'll be damned if you'll&#xD;
ever see the sun set after this evening."&#xD;
"You can net intimidate me by your&#xD;
threats," replied Pecosta, "or cause me to ne~.&#xD;
glect my duty threngh fear of any punish-&#xD;
meat that you can inflict."&#xD;
"Juan," cried the lieutern.ot to one of his&#xD;
party. a large, heavy, square-built man, "pull&#xD;
that old ruffian off his mule, and give him a&#xD;
dozen with the end of your lariat."&#xD;
The musketeer, sinking his rowels into his&#xD;
horse's sides, rushed toward the old tuan, who,&#xD;
with a sudden jerk of his bridle reins, threw&#xD;
his beast upon haunches, and thus avoided&#xD;
the grasp of the soldier, who designed, in&#xD;
passing, to drag him from his seat.&#xD;
AU this while the donkey refused to go&#xD;
forward, 'and Muffles, out of patience with&#xD;
the stubborn beast~ ordered his men to cut&#xD;
t~ thongs: of the prisoner and mount him&#xD;
upon Pecosta's mule; and then cut the use's&#xD;
throat for its obstinacy.&#xD;
Immediately 'the men set to work, some .at&#xD;
the prisoner and others at Pecosta, and had&#xD;
It not been for Martella, the 'orders of&#xD;
Lieutenant Muffles' would have been speedily&#xD;
hut not very gently executed.&#xD;
He had drawn a little apart with Oliuda,&#xD;
that she might not be ir~uited, ~or that he&#xD;
might he at hand to resent the insult, But&#xD;
when he saw the soldier called Juan, sieze the&#xD;
old man by the throat to drag him from his&#xD;
beast, while another held his arms, he draw&#xD;
the revolver Pecoste~ had given hitn, -'and&#xD;
levelling it at Muffles breast, cried out,&#xD;
"Hold 'villainsl the moment yen unseat that~&#xD;
man ~'ou wililose an officer."&#xD;
'Pull him olf," shouted Muffles, with "'an-&#xD;
&#xD;
gry impotence, "and then serve thiabraggart&#xD;
in the same manner."&#xD;
Scarcely were these words ~zttered, en'&#xD;
jPeeosta was thrown with violence to the&#xD;
ground. Olinda screamed, ar'd flung herself&#xD;
from her beast to run. to her father's assis-&#xD;
tance. And Alphonse Martella, true to hi#&#xD;
threat~shot the'lieutenant through the body,&#xD;
and killed him on the spot.'&#xD;
The musketeers, seelng'tlmeir leader fall,&#xD;
fled upon the read ~to Enrita, lea'r~ug Pecos-&#xD;
ta and his party in possession ~f the prb&#xD;
oner.&#xD;
The men of Santiago, ~he had witnessed&#xD;
these transactions with fear' and trembling,&#xD;
were sent to capture the utules, whict. in the'&#xD;
struggle and confusion had' escaped. As If'&#xD;
ashamed of their former inactivity, or afraid&#xD;
of another attack, they. exerted themselves to&#xD;
the utmost, and in a very little time, with the&#xD;
help of their laSsos, reduced the frighted&#xD;
heasts to captivity.&#xD;
The corpse was lifted from, the ground and&#xD;
laid across thesaddle It had occupied beVore&#xD;
the vital fluid run from its veins, aVid the&#xD;
beast upon which it was conveyed was given&#xD;
in charge of one of the attendants. All~&#xD;
things ready, the party resumed its course,&#xD;
and reached Xatam'oras just aS the sun waf&#xD;
sinking behind the hills of Siralvo.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;
Very great was theexeitement produced&#xD;
by the arrival of Pecosta and his party, who,&#xD;
under the direction of a guide. were conduc-&#xD;
ted to the head quarters of the army. ~en-&#xD;
eral Arista, who had arrived at Matamoras&#xD;
in advance of the main body of the troops,&#xD;

20                 THE ME~flCAN BRID~; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
4' the court of General Clarke while military&#xD;
governor of Matamoras and its dependencies,&#xD;
General Arista, surrounded by his officers&#xD;
was publishing the plan of his future opera-.&#xD;
lions. An orderly appeared at the door, and&#xD;
at asiga from the commanding officerannoun-&#xD;
ced Lopez Pocosta, who advanced to the&#xD;
center of theapartment, bowed profoundly to&#xD;
Arista and the other officers present, and in&#xD;
a clear succiut manner, narrated all the inci-&#xD;
dents of the day, and thus concluded:&#xD;
"It was the order of Captain Peron that I&#xD;
should report the prisoner to ~he comman-&#xD;
dant at this post; accordingly, I have&#xD;
brought jiim hither, and have him below in&#xD;
the grand.chamber. The remains of Lieu-&#xD;
tenant Muffles are there also. I regret the&#xD;
death of this man, but my orders were imper.&#xD;
ative, and the necessity unavoidable."&#xD;
"What name bears this stripling who has&#xD;
deprived us of one of the best fighting men&#xD;
in the armies of Mexico?" demanded Ar-&#xD;
ista, with a sternness of expression that clear-&#xD;
ly showed his dissatisfaction.&#xD;
"He is, if I am correctly informed," replied&#xD;
Focosta "the son of General Martella"&#xD;
"Alphonso?" cried Arista.&#xD;
"His name may be Aiphonso," answered&#xD;
Pecosta, affecting ignorance. He is very&#xD;
young, almost beardless indeed, but brave as&#xD;
his grandfather whose name adorns the pa-&#xD;
gee of oar nation's history.&#xD;
"What can a peasant know of his coun-&#xD;
try's history ?" inquired Arista, glancing at&#xD;
the old man with suspicion.&#xD;
"I knew his grandfather well in his life-&#xD;
time," replied Pecosta "and Ibe young mart&#xD;
told me that his name is printed in books."&#xD;
"Where did you know the great Martel-&#xD;
l~~" continued Arista.&#xD;
When he resided in Puebla, at which time&#xD;
he and the elder Rodamont, with whom I&#xD;
lived, were fast friends," answered Pecosta.&#xD;
"How old are you ?" demanded the gee-&#xD;
oral, abruptly, doubting the truth of his&#xD;
statement.&#xD;
"1 was a boy at that time," replied Pecos-&#xD;
to." The younger Rodamont, who was af.&#xD;
terwards secretary of war, and with whom I&#xD;
Eyed up to the time of his bat~ishment, is&#xD;
*     aboutmyownage."&#xD;
&#xD;
~A.nd where is flodarnont now ?" said the&#xD;
questiorior, eyeing the countenance of the old&#xD;
"It was said hefl~d to the United States,"&#xD;
replied Pecostawith a perfect control of his&#xD;
features. "And it was runiored on the coast&#xD;
a day or two since that he had crossed ~the&#xD;
Nueces, and Intended to visit Matamoras&#xD;
and offer hisservices to the Republic."&#xD;
"I sincerely wish he lirould," said Arista,&#xD;
with flashing eyes. "W"e need his services at&#xD;
tbis moment."&#xD;
There was ~meth1ng sinister in the ex-&#xD;
pression of the general's countenance as he&#xD;
uttered these words, and something in the&#xD;
tone of his voice that made the old man&#xD;
think of the gibbet.&#xD;
"You live on the coast?" inquired Arista.&#xD;
"I reside in Santiago," repliedthe old&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"What is your name?" said the general.&#xD;
"Lopez Pecosta," replied the disguised sec&#xD;
rotary.&#xD;
"That is all," said the officer, with a mo&#xD;
tion of his hand toward the door But at&#xD;
the old man turned away he quickly caIlek&#xD;
him by name and added, "Mr. Pecosta, we&#xD;
desire the counsel gf Rodamout, and corn&#xD;
mission you who were formerly his servant to&#xD;
seek his refuge and conduct him hither&#xD;
Your services will not go unrewarded."&#xD;
Pecosta bowed and retired. But he wa~&#xD;
s~arceIy beyond the thresholdwhen he wa~&#xD;
again recalled by the general, who said.&#xD;
"Give the remains of Lieutenant Muffles in.&#xD;
to the hands of the guard, to he conveyed to&#xD;
his friends. Turn the prisoner over to the&#xD;
officer of the night, to be brought hither for&#xD;
examination."&#xD;
In the course of a few moments, Captain&#xD;
Leonard was conducted into the presence of&#xD;
Arista. His hands were crossed behind his&#xD;
back and bound with thong&amp;amp; There was&#xD;
anxiety in his countenance, but his step was&#xD;
firm, and his bearing undaunted.&#xD;
The general of the Mexican army, said to he&#xD;
one of the largest men in the republic, pri.&#xD;
dot himself not a little upon his dimensions;&#xD;
but when he looked upon the gigantic pro-&#xD;
portions of the prisoner, he keehly felt his&#xD;
own insignificance; and more particularly, as&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RANGER'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
at the moment of Pecosta's announcementhe&#xD;
was speaking of the Americans, and repre-&#xD;
senting them as a diminutive and effeminate&#xD;
people, from whom they had nothing to fear&#xD;
but the loss of their property.&#xD;
"Prisoner" said the general, "to what count..&#xD;
ry do you beloDg." "I am a citizen of the Re.&#xD;
public of theUnited States," replied Captain&#xD;
Leonard.&#xD;
This morning you called yourself a citi-&#xD;
zen of Buenos Ayres ?" said thegeneral.&#xD;
"T did," returned the prisoner, "but it was to&#xD;
avoid difficutly. lam a native of Ohio, and&#xD;
a citizen of Cincinnati."&#xD;
"What is the name pf your principal ho-.&#xD;
tel?" inquired the general quickly, perciev-&#xD;
ng from this answer that he could judge of&#xD;
his truth in other things by his replies to&#xD;
Interogatories requiring local information.&#xD;
"When I was last in Cincinnati." replied&#xD;
Captain Leonard "it was Broadway."&#xD;
"Where is it situated ?" continued Arista.&#xD;
You wish to tes~~y veracity" replied said&#xD;
I the Captain, "for you are well acquainted&#xD;
with its location, it being the hotel at which&#xD;
you and Major Isadore put up during yo~Ir&#xD;
'tay in that city."&#xD;
"From whom did you learn these facts?"&#xD;
~sked the general.&#xD;
They came to my knowledge during boy-&#xD;
~iood," replied the prisoner, "and in that way&#xD;
which st likely to leave an impression.&#xD;
A. distinguished leader of the forces of the&#xD;
great republic of Mexico, an exile in a&#xD;
strange country and in the midst of stran-&#xD;
gerM, soon obtained a notoriety that excited&#xD;
~ e curiosity of the universal Yankee nation.&#xD;
As one of that people, though 'at the time&#xD;
aschoolboyI felt a desire to look upon a man&#xD;
who was accounted worthy to suffer, for the&#xD;
cause of his country, and so ventured to the&#xD;
Broadway Hotel, when I was introduced in-&#xD;
to your presence, not as on this occasion, but&#xD;
with unshackled hands."&#xD;
The allusion to scenes and sufferings so&#xD;
long past. but in which he had acte4 so&#xD;
prominent apart and enduted so much ~fter-&#xD;
wards, touched a tender spot in the~general'e&#xD;
heart and melted it to tears.&#xD;
&#xD;
SI&#xD;
&#xD;
"Unbind the prisoner," said he, as sees&#xD;
as he could master his emotion.&#xD;
The officer of the night, to whom these&#xD;
words were addressed, immediately stepped&#xD;
forward and severed the bonds tiat bound&#xD;
his hands. A chair was brought for him to&#xD;
sit upon, and a basin of water to reducethe&#xD;
swelling occasioned by the thongs.&#xD;
After a little while spent in silence, Arista&#xD;
addressing the officer of the night, gave some&#xD;
directions touching the arrest of Alphouso&#xD;
Martella. He also directed that a party of&#xD;
thirty men should he detailed, fortbwith, to&#xD;
go in search of Rodamont,~who was supposed&#xD;
to be somewhere within the disputed tern-&#xD;
tory.&#xD;
Turning to one of the officers with whom&#xD;
he had been conversing, he added," Captain&#xD;
Costo, I will entrust you with this expedi-&#xD;
tion, and leave you in all things thereto per.&#xD;
taming, to follow the dictates of your own&#xD;
judgment. You may depart to-night, or wait&#xD;
till morning, aslou prefer."&#xD;
He next addressed the prisoner, inquiring&#xD;
in wha country he had learned to talk the&#xD;
Spani language.&#xD;
nearly eighteen years," replied Cap.&#xD;
tam   onard, "I have followed a sea-faring&#xD;
life; half of that time I have commanded&#xD;
a vessel, and traded along the coast of South&#xD;
America; and the greater portion of the last&#xD;
mentioned period I have talked no other lan-&#xD;
guage."&#xD;
"Then how is it that I find you in this&#xD;
unpleasant situation?" asked thegeneral.&#xD;
"A few months ago I tarried a cargo ci&#xD;
cattle.pelts from Buenos Ayres to New Or-&#xD;
leans," replied CaptainLeonard, "and while&#xD;
here was solicited by General Hunt,, the&#xD;
quartermaster at that p!ace~ to take a ship&#xD;
load of bread to the army of occupation at&#xD;
Corpus Christi. Since then, until made a&#xD;
prisoner by Captain Peron, I have been ii&#xD;
the employ of my government."&#xD;
"I suppose your attachment foryour~ na-&#xD;
tive country is not very strong," said Arista,&#xD;
interrogatively, "sincq you have been ecu-&#xD;
tented to spend so mans' years abt~oad ?"&#xD;
"The people of America,". replied the priu.&#xD;
oner, "not unfrequently go to other countries&#xD;

The general PUrS~Wd the sukj~ot no further,&#xD;
but siuzply added, "I~ regret, sir, that it 25&#xD;
my duty te i~nprison one who has, sympa.&#xD;
~his~ with, me in my troubles and sufferings;&#xD;

CHAPTER VIL&#xD;
&#xD;
The prison in whioh Captain Leonard was&#xD;

esost from the plaza, situated in a back cou-~&#xD;
tinuation o~ the building above z~i~utione~1.~&#xD;
The entire ediflee~ including' all tAe floors&#xD;
the lower story, w5s made of brick. There&#xD;
was no window an the ~(ponj except a entail&#xD;
aperture nepr the eel~Ing, about the size of a&#xD;

with        id'    '    Costa, "is your&#xD;

)' Good night," returned' Captain Leonard,&#xD;
with emotion, partly occasioned by hismis.&#xD;
&#xD;
frtune, and partly *y the kindness' of the&#xD;
officer, who iminedi~tely retired and locked&#xD;
the door on the outside.&#xD;
For the space of an hour Captain Leonar4&#xD;
walked backward and forward across the floor&#xD;
of his cell, meditating upon his unfortunate&#xD;
situation~ iwd striving to conjecture the des.&#xD;
tiny of his little schooner. But at the end&#xD;
of this time lie had only gained exhaustion,'&#xD;
which perhaps enabled him sooner to forget&#xD;
his Sorrows in the profound repose of youth&#xD;
and innocence.&#xD;
The next day the jailor brought his break~&#xD;
fast about eight o'clock. It consisted of a&#xD;
cup of coffee, a beefsteak, and cakes of maize,&#xD;
prepared without sifting and mixed with&#xD;
water. He drank the coffee, but found it mi.&#xD;
possible to swallow a mouthful of the bread&#xD;
or moat; not because they were unfit for diet&#xD;
but for want of an appetite.&#xD;
At noon the jailor came again, and then&#xD;
he managed to eat a little, but his appetite&#xD;
was small and easily satisfied. And agaiu&#xD;
in the evening he took a few bites, and drank&#xD;
another cup of coffee. And thus passed the&#xD;
first day of hisimprisontuent.&#xD;
All day long he bad expected a visit from&#xD;
some person authorized to conduct him to&#xD;
the better quarters proniised, but tue day&#xD;
passed and no one entered his cell but the&#xD;
sailor, who made no allusion to the mMter,&#xD;
but served him in silence. ~&amp;amp;t first he sop.&#xD;
posed the apartment to be fitted for his ac&#xD;
coinniodation was not made ready for want&#xD;
of time, perhaps, hat he ilusily concluded,&#xD;
when no one came near during the day, tbat&#xD;
the promises of 'the general-in-chief were all&#xD;
hollow, and hetbrew himself upon his bed&#xD;
in a state of dsspalr.&#xD;
The neXt utteringg 'he interrogated the&#xD;
jailor, who infor~aed him that his name had&#xD;
not been mentioned, to his knowledge, on the&#xD;
day previous., "The mind of the command~&#xD;
ant," said he, "is occupied with a matter at&#xD;
more importance."&#xD;
It appeared that on the &amp;amp;veniug pi~e~Uu~,'&#xD;
Aiphonso Martella, on arriving at Matiino-&#xD;
ras, surrendered himself to the municipal an.&#xD;
thorities, to be examined in reference to the&#xD;
death of Pedro Muffles.&#xD;
A short time after, the guard detailed by~&#xD;

the cdui'se of civil justice, anti that l~ie arrest&#xD;
of the alguazil was a high-handed measure&#xD;
that ought not to ~O unpunished.&#xD;
1l~e further claiin'ed that Alphonse Marl&#xD;

and ought therefore to be judged by the civl&#xD;

On the other hand, General Arista ma~n~&#xD;
~ained that asthe murdered man was an officer&#xD;
of the army, the murderer ought to be tried&#xD;
byacourt martial, and judgett by th~ military&#xD;
law of the Republic.&#xD;
It was probable that an examination be-.&#xD;
fore either tribu~ial wo~dd reeu~lt in the ac-&#xD;
quittal of the prisoner; but the matter in-&#xD;
voaved a question which neither party was&#xD;
willing to sacrifice. The state of excitement&#xD;
was already very great, and the quarrel wax-&#xD;
ed warmer with the lapse of time.&#xD;
This information fully explainedd the cause&#xD;
of the neglectCaptain Leonard had experi-&#xD;
euced~ and he began to regard the dungeon&#xD;
as. his' future abode. For hours after the&#xD;
sailor withdrew, he paced his cell in a state'&#xD;
of excitement little phort of insanity. Up&#xD;
and down, and across~and back, an4 angular&#xD;
-there was no course he did not take, and&#xD;
~arcely a spot upou which he did, not tread.'&#xD;
Once near the head~of 'his bed he felt a,&#xD;
brick give slightly nuder' the pressure of his&#xD;
footi, but he was too much excited at the mo.~&#xD;
au~nt to derive any advantage front the die-&#xD;
covery. He oniy avoided ii in future, and&#xD;
oontinu'cd to pace the floor until a~ain ex-&#xD;
hausted when he cast himself upon~ his bed&#xD;
&#xD;
and tt~ied t~ thr~et Ins~tnisery; but sleep had&#xD;
forsaken his eyes, and slumber his eyelids,&#xD;
and after tossing about for a time he rose&#xD;
andhresumed his w.~tking.&#xD;
Bat though he slept nM' wlitlo he lay oi&#xD;
the bed, he was nevertheless rested, and his&#xD;
mental excitement to a g~eat degree allayed.&#xD;
Now he 6e~an to consider~ his sltuat.ioxr die-&#xD;

he found it l~o5e, aiid capabl.~ .~f removal&#xD;
with his hands. 'The dirt beneath wM soft,&#xD;
and of a character th~t could be easily dis-&#xD;

After this distovery 'he began to enter*alii&#xD;

to the residenceofMru. Cathedra, a widow of&#xD;
great wealth and beauty, who had many ad-&#xD;
mirers and not a few suitors, although she&#xD;
filled the alliterative. phrase, "fat, fair, and&#xD;
forty," except that her complexion was de-&#xD;
cidedly olive.&#xD;
Now, it so happened that at the moment&#xD;
Captain Leonard passed up through theearth&#xD;
like Samuel at the bidding of Endor's witch,&#xD;
the beautiful widow was standing at the door&#xD;
of her house, within a few feet of the pris-&#xD;
on wall, talking to one of her lovers who was&#xD;
about to take his departure.&#xD;
The beams of the moon were exceedingly&#xD;
brilliant, and the walLof the prison was cov-&#xD;
ered with their light, though the widow and&#xD;
her lover stood within the shadow of her&#xD;
dwelling.&#xD;
The widow, whose face was turned toward&#xD;
the wall at the moment of the disrupture of'&#xD;
the earth and sudden appearance of a creature&#xD;
whom she thought the princeofPandemonium&#xD;
shrieked and fled into the house, leaving her&#xD;
lover to divine, as beet he bould, the cause&#xD;
of her singular behaviour.&#xD;
The noise of the breach attracting his at-&#xD;
tention, he turned about just at tfie moment&#xD;
Captain Leonard removed the blanketfrom&#xD;
his head, and seeing a man hale-way protrud-&#xD;
ed through the earth, with a long beard&#xD;
sweeping his breast, mistook him for the spir-&#xD;
it of Samuel himself, and was scarcely less&#xD;
frightened than the widow, and fled with as&#xD;
much precipitation.&#xD;
Half a douen of the lower liricks fell from&#xD;
their places, and that part of the wall imnie-&#xD;
diately above the Subterranean passage, sunk&#xD;
several inches; but the pressure from each&#xD;
side prevented a general crash.&#xD;
But the aperture was so much diminished&#xD;
by the wall's depression, that it became nec-&#xD;
essary to remove a couple of bricks before&#xD;
Pecosta could force his body through.&#xD;
"Captain Leonard," said ho, speaking&#xD;
through the passage, "the removal ofa single&#xD;
brick will cause the entire waIl to crumble&#xD;
down; the noise will rouse the garrison, and&#xD;
we shall be recaptured before we are fairly&#xD;
free.~ Make use of your liberty, and leave&#xD;
me to my fate."&#xD;
&#xD;
TIlE RANGER'S REVENt~L&#xD;
&#xD;
'No," returned Captain ..eonard, "I will&#xD;
not forsake a fellow prisoner."&#xD;
"But there can be no sympathy between'.&#xD;
as such as other criminalsfeel for each other,"&#xD;
said Fecosta, "for you are a prisoner otwar,&#xD;
and I a prisoner of the law ; you are confined&#xD;
to deprive your country of your services, but&#xD;
I by legal arrest, to suflbr for a crime."&#xD;
"True," replied Captain Leonard,, "we&#xD;
have not the emotions of criminals, for we&#xD;
have not sinned like them; but thereje the&#xD;
sympathy which one human being feels for&#xD;
another in distress and that's enough to jus-&#xD;
tify my further assistance."&#xD;
"But there is no law of our nature stronger&#xD;
than self-preservation," said Fecosta, "and&#xD;
not even gratitude requires the sacrifice or&#xD;
one man's life to save another's."&#xD;
~"A man may take another's life to save&#xD;
his own, and by the law be justified," re-&#xD;
turned Captain Leonard," because there is&#xD;
nothing dearer to a man than his life, and&#xD;
such an act is human. And a man may if&#xD;
he chose, give his life for another's and none&#xD;
should condemn' the sacrifice, for the deed is&#xD;
divine, at leaat so far as emulation extends,&#xD;
Christ having died for a sinful world."&#xD;
"But if you -remain here," said the Mcxi-&#xD;
.cau, "both may be lost; whereas, if you fly&#xD;
at once, one may escape. I will wait a few&#xD;
minutes, until I think you have got beyond&#xD;
the wall that encloses the garden, before I&#xD;
attempt to enlarge the aperture."&#xD;
"I will not go," said Captain Leonard,&#xD;
firmly. "It shall never be said, that I aban-&#xD;
doned a fellow prisoner. It Is enough that&#xD;
we have occupied, though for an hour only,&#xD;
the same dungeon cell."&#xD;
"YOu Americans are a 'singular pco~le,"&#xD;
said Pecosta. "But a few mornings since,&#xD;
you seized me by the throat, dashed me to&#xD;
the earth, called me liar and scoundrel, and&#xD;
now you basard your life to save mine.&#xD;
But we consume thee unnecessarily by' our&#xD;
conversation; if you are determined t&amp;amp;risk&#xD;
so much, better that it be done before we&#xD;
are discovered."&#xD;
"It was In the heat of passion," said Cap..&#xD;

When they reached the opposite wall, a&#xD;

"But how shall we get there?" said Cap.&#xD;
tam Leonard. "Between us and it there&#xD;
are a hundred yards of space, and eviry one&#xD;
is filled with the rays of the moon."&#xD;
We must glide from tree to tree, 'and from&#xD;
bush to bush, until we reach the opposite&#xD;
wall," answered Pecosta. It is not the first&#xD;
time I have thus ~caped~&#xD;
Au he finished speaking, he darted from the&#xD;
side of his companion, and like a streak of&#xD;
light, so quick was the movement, passed to&#xD;
the shadow of a poramegranate bush.&#xD;
Captain Leonard *as preparing to fellow,&#xD;
when his eye accidentally fell upon a postein&#xD;
partially concealed by the shadow of the tre-&#xD;
under which he was standing. Therefore&#xD;
instead of following Pecosta, as was hs in-&#xD;
tention a moment previous, he turned to and&#xD;
examined the, gate, which, to his surprise,&#xD;
was fastened only with a latch. Of this fact&#xD;
he immediately informed Pecosta, who~ re-&#xD;
turned to the shadow of the Orange-tree, with&#xD;
a celerity that showed his eagerness t~ escape&#xD;
from the enclosure.&#xD;
In the space of another minute the fugi-&#xD;
tives had passedthe wicket, which they closed&#xD;
aller them, and fastened, by drawicig a stick&#xD;
through the~handle of' the latch. They were&#xD;
now in the enclosure of General Martilla,&#xD;
whose wife and Mrs. Cathedra were very&#xD;
ntirnate, and kept up a daily intercourse by&#xD;
neans of this postern; but these facts were&#xD;
unknown to them until afterward.&#xD;
CHAPTER LX.&#xD;
The fugitives, after a brief consultation&#xD;
touching their future movements, proceeded&#xD;

but a considerable portion of the city, and&#xD;
produced a general consternation.&#xD;
It was afterwards made to appear, that&#xD;
enact lire exa~$ning party In the adjo4iing&#xD;
apolosure, seeing the pendant brick which the&#xD;
clothes of Pecosta had partially displaced,&#xD;
thoughtlessly struck it with tir. end of his&#xD;
baton, and forced it from its fastenings. As&#xD;
before observed, this brick was the key to&#xD;
the whole arch, and when It fell there was&#xD;
nothing to support the wall and roof, both&#xD;
of which came tumbling down with a fearful&#xD;
noise, and completely crushed and covered&#xD;
theprls6ners bed beneath the ruins.&#xD;
When the astonishment had in a measure&#xD;
subsided, or ore were given to remove the&#xD;
rubbish an extricate the prisoners, who&#xD;
were sup sed to be underneath. A party&#xD;
of soldicr~s were immediately set to work,&#xD;
who, aftsr half an hour's vigorous labor,&#xD;
reached the bed, which they found brokeii&#xD;
dowe, but unoccupied.&#xD;
Up to thi~ time the story of Mrs. Cathe-&#xD;
dra's lover bad received but little attention,&#xD;
and even now it was not fully credited. That&#xD;
the prisoners had escaped by a subterranean&#xD;
passage was obvious upon examination; but&#xD;
the opinion obtained generally that they had&#xD;
received assistance.&#xD;
As Velasquez Rornanno, the lover above&#xD;
mentioned, was the' only peiuon present who&#xD;
had witnessed the prisoner's eruption, ~nd&#xD;
as the story Itself was highly improbable in&#xD;
the opinion of the officer of the night, he fell&#xD;
under instant suspicion, which was mani-&#xD;
fested at the moment rather by significant&#xD;
looks and nods thati by words, for he was a&#xD;
merchant of the city, a man of great wealth&#xD;
and influence, and almost universally re-&#xD;
speCt8d~&#xD;
But when these facts were reported to&#xD;
.krlsta, he orderedihe merchant to be imme-&#xD;
diately arrestedaild kept in cotifinement sub.&#xD;
ject to his farther orders. But Captain Bar&#xD;
beta, 'who was a personal friend of Romanno,&#xD;
after his arrest being charged with his cue.&#xD;
tody~ released ~hi~n ~n his parole, believins,&#xD;
po~wlthutandlng ~.rista~s suspicion, that his&#xD;
lnuot.ence w~iuld be clearly, and if certain in~&#xD;
formation should prove to be correct, pert&#xD;
haps easily established.&#xD;
&#xD;
Meanwhile the fugitives lay close to the&#xD;
ground in the shadoW of the east wallfor the&#xD;
Inmates of the dwelling, alarmed by the crash,&#xD;
bad gathered together upon the vestibule&#xD;
and the slightest movement could not have&#xD;
escaped their observation .&#xD;
CaptainBarbata, who, as before observed,&#xD;
believed the story of his friend, concluded&#xD;
that the fugitives, the wicket having been&#xD;
properly secured, were somewhere conceakd&#xD;
within Mrs. Cathedra's garden.&#xD;
Acting vpon this belief, a company ci&#xD;
searchers were formed, to make an examina-&#xD;
tion; but after the lapse of half an hour, the&#xD;
garden having been thoroughly scrutinized,&#xD;
an inspection0of the wall was ordered, and&#xD;
the poster through which the prisoners es&#xD;
caped discovered.&#xD;
* As the gate was barred on the other side,&#xD;
Romanno was dispatched to inquire of Mrs.&#xD;
Cathedra concerning the communication. Ii&#xD;
a few moments he returned with information&#xD;
to the effect, that the wicket opened Into her&#xD;
garden from general Martella's, and that it&#xD;
had never been fastened. other than with a&#xD;
latch, since the General's family came to re-&#xD;
Bide in MatamoraS.&#xD;
This intelligence increased a suspicion al~&#xD;
ready existing in the minds of Captain Bar-&#xD;
bate and others present, that the former&#xD;
friendship of Martella anctflodamont, had in-&#xD;
duced the former to procure the latter's libe-&#xD;
ration.. It was well known that in all the&#xD;
army, Santa Anna~ had not so devoted and&#xD;
fearless a friend as the General nor any where&#xD;
so able and tr~ithfiil a counsellor as the ex-&#xD;
secretary; and these facts were the ground&#xD;
of suspicion.&#xD;
On receiving this information, Captain&#xD;
Barbata, who was a secret enemy of General&#xD;
Martella, ordered the examiners to stave the&#xD;
postern, and search his premises, and If neces-&#xD;
sary, not to spare his lady's bedroom. The&#xD;
last clause of this sentence was a sort of gene.&#xD;
ral license todo whatever inclination prompt&#xD;
ed, and was made that the soldiers might give&#xD;
the family all possible annoyance.&#xD;
No sooner were the orders pronounced,&#xD;
than they sett~ work tocarryit into effect,&#xD;
-. with an energy~that clearly showed in whaV&#xD;
sense it was understood. A very few ini~&#xD;

~closure.&#xD;
During all the time occupied in the re&#xD;
moval of the rubbish from the broken bed&#xD;
and the examination of Mrs. Oathedra'e&#xD;
garden, the fugitives had remained in th&#xD;
place and position above mentioned; bul&#xD;
when the searchers forced their way through&#xD;
the poster, further concealment was im&#xD;
possible.&#xD;
'~ We must now run for our lives," said&#xD;
Pecosta; "for the Philistines are upon us.1'&#xD;
"Whither shall we run ?" inquired Captain&#xD;
Leonard. "We are encompassed by walk&#xD;
half as high as the houses to which they are&#xD;
attached; besides, the moment we move&#xD;
we become visible."&#xD;
"Do you suppose my young friend," said&#xD;
the Mexican, energetically, "that by remain.&#xD;
big here we shall escape discovery? I assure&#xD;
you there i~ot a foot of ground within the&#xD;
enclosure tha will not be examined."&#xD;
." I do not,"~answered Captain Leonard.&#xD;
"But I repeat, whither shall we fly ?-how&#xD;
shall we get beyond these walls?"&#xD;
"To the housa, and through the house,"&#xD;
replied Pecosta, springingto his feet. "Fol.&#xD;
low me, quick," he added, darting off in the&#xD;
shadow of the wall toward the dwelling.&#xD;
Captain Leonard instantly obeyed: but&#xD;
he had not made above a dozen steps, when&#xD;
the surface of the ground gave way, and he&#xD;
disappeared from the sight of recosta as&#xD;
suddenly as he had appeared a while before&#xD;
to Romanno and the beautiful widow.&#xD;
The noise of the rupture attracted the at..&#xD;
tension of the soldiers, one of whom, seeing&#xD;
the Mexican in his fight, which he continued&#xD;
notwithstanding the sudden disappearance of&#xD;
his companion, cried out, "Rodamont," and&#xD;
gave immediate chase. Tbeothers,.catching&#xD;
up the cry, hurried away in the same direc-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
As they rushed forward eager in the pur-&#xD;
suit, and heedless of their steps, one of the&#xD;
foremostinthe chase chanced upon the chasm,&#xD;
and 'involuntarily followed Captain Leonard&#xD;
into his subterranean concealment. Iliscom..&#xD;
onionsn, indifferent to his fate under the ex-&#xD;
&#xD;
e citement, held on their course, and entered&#xD;
I the house soon after the fugitive.&#xD;
- lt~was not until Pecosta was within a few&#xD;
rods of the building, that he recognized the&#xD;
residence of General Martella; but ~this die.&#xD;
cover inspired him with hope, and animated&#xD;
him to greater exertions.&#xD;
The lower door of the house had been&#xD;
opened for the egress ot the servants, one of&#xD;
whom stood upon the threshold, resolved to&#xD;
proteethis master's domicile against intruders.&#xD;
~ut he had scarcely determined his duty,&#xD;
when Pecouta darted past him, mounted the&#xD;
stairs, passed through the scuttle, and stood&#xD;
upon the house.top.&#xD;
In Matamoras the roofh of the houses are&#xD;
commonly fiat, and covered with square&#xD;
bricks such as are generally used in tropical&#xD;
countries for floors and pavement&amp;amp; On the&#xD;
* west side of the Plasa do ilidalgo, from the&#xD;
residence of Mrs. Cathedra to the corner of&#xD;
the block, and thence westward to the corner&#xD;
of the cross-street, the houses were all joined&#xD;
together, and a person might pass from the&#xD;
roof of one to the roof of another without&#xD;
difficulty.&#xD;
Lbpez Pecosta, when he reached the house.&#xD;
top, did not pause to survey the scene below,&#xD;
in which servants and soldiers were striving,&#xD;
the one to gain and the other to prevent an&#xD;
entrance; but hurried away toward the west&#xD;
until he reached the futhermost house, to&#xD;
which was attached another running back,&#xD;
with a sloping roof, the eaves of which at one&#xD;
end touched the wall. Down this roof he&#xD;
hastened, and then along the wall to the ex-&#xD;
tremity, when he disappeared.&#xD;
By this time Alplionso Martella, by his&#xD;
presence and authority, had quelled~ the&#xD;
-strife between his father's domestics and the&#xD;
repulsed soldiers, and then the following con-&#xD;
versation ensued.&#xD;
"What means all this confusion?" said the&#xD;
young man to one of the soldiers.&#xD;
"We are in pursuit of ,pld Rodamount,&#xD;
who has escaped from prison and sought re-&#xD;

THE MEXICAN BRIDE; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
the receptaclelxOlookSd tobediscever5d, and&#xD;
had neither the means of concealment nor tb&#xD;
escape. This was his apprehension, that his ci&#xD;
~ursuer5, seein% tlit chasm, would cause the sc&#xD;
cistern to be explored; and it was increased n~&#xD;
by the misfortune of their companiOn, whom CI&#xD;
they would certainly seek and find at the&#xD;
bottom9&#xD;
Hoping that his disappearance had es- ti&#xD;
caped the observation of all but Rodamount, i'&#xD;
he dre.gged the body of the dead Mexican&#xD;
which had tumbled toward the center of the&#xD;
reservoir, back to the opening, that it might b&#xD;
be discoVered by the first who entered; and&#xD;
the manner in which it was subsequently die- e&#xD;
posed of, has been already related.&#xD;
After the soldierfrhad abandoned the search&#xD;
and returned to their quarters, Capt. Leonard h&#xD;
endeavored to extricate himself, but without&#xD;
success: for the board that yielded to his&#xD;
weight in a horizontal position, and by means&#xD;
of which he tried to reach the top of the re-&#xD;
servoir, did no better service as an inclined I&#xD;
plane.&#xD;
It was now evident ~that at the bottom of. 4&#xD;
this cistern he was obliged to remain until&#xD;
assistance was afforded by Rodamount, or, if I&#xD;
.J of his power, by some one he himself&#xD;
might attract to the breach by his cries.&#xD;
However, for the~ present he resolved not to&#xD;
give an alarm, lest he should discover h~s&#xD;
lurking.plO.Eie to tome patrol or sentinel, but&#xD;
to wait until the morning, when some person&#xD;
belonging to the family ehonld pass by, to&#xD;
visit the broken fiower-be~L -&#xD;
Accordingly, he threw himself upon the&#xD;
floor of the cistern, ~which like the sides was&#xD;
smoothly plastered, and being fatigried, soon&#xD;
fell asleep. It was nine o'clock the next&#xD;
morning when he awoke, and the first&#xD;
sound that greetedhis ear, was the musical&#xD;
voice of Olinda Rodainont. For a moment&#xD;
he believed she was sent thither by her father,&#xD;
to effect his further liberation; butter words&#xD;
which were distinctly heard, soon convinced&#xD;
him of the contrary.&#xD;
"Let me talk of my father, of the bearded&#xD;
American. of this broken cistern that will&#xD;
hold no water, of anything on earth, Al-&#xD;
phonse, but love," said the maiden earnestly.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Ikuow that thOse you have specified are&#xD;
ie popular themes of gossip throughout the&#xD;
ty," replied Martella, whey voice the pri-&#xD;
immer instantly recognized, "but they have&#xD;
r interest for me beyen~l the pleasmr~e oc~&#xD;
isionOd by your IMlier's escape."&#xD;
"See how little Lola's flower-bed is bro-&#xD;
en?' said Olinda, wishing to avert his&#xD;
droughts from the subject he was endeavor-&#xD;
ig to introduce.&#xD;
"It can be mended?' returned Martella,&#xD;
but if you break my heart, Olinda, I should&#xD;
ecome a wreck."&#xD;
Aiphonso," said themaiden, with increased&#xD;
arneetness, "why will you persist, when&#xD;
hereby both of us are rendered miserable?"&#xD;
"It is in your power to make us both&#xD;
appy ;" replied Martilla, "but I fear you&#xD;
will not, unless you are urged."&#xD;
"And will not if urged by all the friends&#xD;
have on earth," returned Olinda, em-&#xD;
)haticall&#xD;
y.&#xD;
"Captain Peron is in no respect your&#xD;
~quaI," persisted Martilla, not a particle die.&#xD;
3ouraged by her emphatic manner; "and in&#xD;
i. moral point of view, he is totaUy unworthy&#xD;
of one so pure in thought, and so prudent in&#xD;
behavior."&#xD;
"it may be true, Alphonse," said Olinda;&#xD;
but it becomes me not to hear remarks ut-&#xD;
tered in dispraise of one to whom I am affi-&#xD;
anced."&#xD;
"But~ it is your duty to consider them,"&#xD;
returned the youth, "for the happiness of a&#xD;
life-time is of vastly more importance than&#xD;
the fulfilment ofa promise. Besides, Olinda,&#xD;
you do not love him,.and rio woman should&#xD;
wed a man she~does not rove."&#xD;
"Proceed, Aiphonso," said the maiden,&#xD;
resignedly, "my imprudence merits your tor~&#xD;
ture."&#xD;
"Your imprudence, Olinda," exclaimed the&#xD;
youth; "you have never done an imprudent&#xD;
thing in you life."&#xD;
"Have! not?" said the young lady. "Then&#xD;
to confess a love for one and he betrothed to&#xD;
another is not an imprudence."&#xD;
"Net so great a one certainly," replied&#xD;
Martilla, "as to love one and wed e.nothe~."&#xD;

~'Leave me, Aiphonso, leave me," cried&#xD;
linda; "I can bear no more."&#xD;
"I will leave you, dear, if it is your wish,"&#xD;
plied the youth, "but net here by the side&#xD;
f this frightful chasm, so suggestive of&#xD;
eBth.'&#xD;
"Do you fear that I shall destroy my life,'&#xD;
ked the maiden. "But you need nut, it&#xD;
not yet so great a burden. I prefer to re-&#xD;
Bin by these wilting flowers."&#xD;
"I go, then," said Alphonse; "but I carry&#xD;
ope in my heart."&#xD;
With these words he turned away, and&#xD;
alked slowly toward the mansion, leaving&#xD;
linda by the broken flower bed.&#xD;
"There was a timQ when Captain Peron 4&#xD;
as as dear to me ~as life," soliioquized the&#xD;
iden,-..a time when I regarded him as&#xD;

After these words, her thoughts for a time I&#xD;
ere unspoken; at length she walked close to I&#xD;
ge of the opening, and remarked, "Flow ~&#xD;

and how easy it would be here to end ~ny ~&#xD;

Au she spoke, she looked steadfastly down&#xD;
the deep reqeptacle,~ for a moment; then&#xD;
ed her eyes to heaven, and implored for. r&#xD;
ene~s for the self-sacrifice shewas about&#xD;
ofFer upon the altar of disappointed love.&#xD;

"One who entered unwillingly, ~hut would&#xD;

ing as brightly as it had ever done in Mexico4&#xD;
There was not a cloud to obscure its beams&#xD;
not a mist to dim it rays Earth, air and&#xD;
sky were illuminated.&#xD;
Guide and fugitive, side by side,. and in the&#xD;
shadow of the hous~~~, left the mansion of&#xD;
Martilla, and started toward the river. lint&#xD;
"the streets of Matamoras were at that time&#xD;
partrolled from dark to 'day-light, a~d several&#xD;

questioned, and permitted to p*ocecd~&#xD;
They niet with no Serious opposition, how-&#xD;
ever, until they had passed beyond the city&#xD;
proper and entered the suburbs, where they&#xD;
were again challenged, and being exposed to&#xD;
the uuoon'slisht, Captain Leonard was recog.-&#xD;
nized and immediately- ~rreeted. But~ the&#xD;
guide4 taking advantage dt the snrpri~ 'und&#xD;
soy-of the patrolslipped away unobserved,&#xD;
and effected his ese4se.&#xD;
Captain Leonard w&amp;amp; placed: between tV4~&#xD;
soldiers, having loaded muskets ~vith the&#xD;
&#xD;
bayonets fixed, who were ordered to conte~&#xD;
him safely to the quarters of the comiteauid&#xD;
ante The patrol, except the two detalIe~&#xD;
to conduct the prisoner, continued om thel&#xD;
course; and these set about to ~xecuite thel&#xD;
orders.&#xD;
That there might be no possibility&#xD;
escape, theywalkedso close the prisoner tbt&#xD;
his and their elbow touched. And i&#xD;
* this manner they proceeded until the patro&#xD;
was out of sight and hearing, when (laptal&#xD;
Leonard, striking each guaad across th&#xD;
throat at thesame moment and throwing lii&#xD;
weight of his own body backward, assistedb~&#xD;
the strength of his arms, hurled them both I&#xD;
the ground and fled.&#xD;
By this action one of tb~enn was stunned V&#xD;
insensibility, but the other, who was consid&#xD;
ably injured by the fall, discharged his mu&#xD;
* ket, and summoned the patrol to their assis&#xD;
ance.&#xD;
Meanwhile the fugitive had reached II&#xD;
river and taken possession of the bomtbavii~&#xD;
first knocked down the ferryman, who offers&#xD;
some resistance. But thepatrol immediately&#xD;
gav~ chase, and where at tha basdn of II&#xD;

when, observing a couple of fr~ats in pur-&#xD;
suit, he jumped into the river and swam&#xD;
Mhore~&#xD;
His pursuers immediatelyrowe4 their boats&#xD;
to the bank, and gave chase among the chap-&#xD;
arab The prisoner was swift of foot, and&#xD;
having a loi~g start, soon left them behind&#xD;
and out of sight. But escaping from one&#xD;
danger he ran directly into another.&#xD;
Captain Costawhoni Arista had dispatched&#xD;
in search of Hernando Rodamount, having&#xD;
scoured the country between the Rio Grande&#xD;
and the Nueces, for fifty miles from. the coust,&#xD;
was on his return to the city. lie was en-&#xD;
camped to rest ~r~d refresh his horses during&#xD;
the heat of the day, and was concealed be'&#xD;
neath a ~clump of ~osqueet trees, which Cap-&#xD;
tain Leonard endeavored to place between&#xD;
himself and purs~crs&#xD;
This brought him completely within the&#xD;
powe~ of the searching party, who made him&#xD;
a prisoner, and conducted hiui to Matamo-&#xD;
ms1 where he was Confined in the city prison.&#xD;
The question between the civte and milit-&#xD;
ary authorities, touching the arrest and trial&#xD;
of AlphonsoMartella, which had been referred&#xD;
to the Ecesident for decision, was nOt yet set.-&#xD;
tied, and a new difficulty arose out oUthe&#xD;
capture of Captain Leonard.&#xD;
The prefect of the~ city refused to receive&#xD;
the prisoner or be aei~ountable for his securi-&#xD;
ty, unless the general would resigrt Martella&#xD;
into the hands of the municipal authorities;&#xD;
rand Arista, inflamed on account of his arro-&#xD;
gance, threatened to place the city under&#xD;
inartiallawand take forcible possession of the&#xD;
prison.&#xD;
At this juncture General Martella arrived&#xD;
in the city, andyroposed that his eon should&#xD;
be submitted for an examination before both&#xD;
authorities, and be judged by the laws of&#xD;
each; and that as the military,- except under&#xD;
the most critical circumstances, ought~to be&#xD;
subservient to ith~ civil powers, the first ex~&#xD;
examination should be made by the authorities&#xD;
to whom the supposed offender had surren~&#xD;
dere&amp;amp;himself.&#xD;
A~ this, could be done independent uf'the&#xD;
abntracti'ou submitted for the decision et&#xD;
President Jierrera, the~ proposition was at~&#xD;
&#xD;
once adopted, and the young 'man, after .a&#xD;
great deal of verbiage and speculation was&#xD;
honorable aquit~ed, on the grounds ofjnstift.&#xD;
catioui and'seIt-defeu~e, by both tribijuale.&#xD;
The adjustment of this ditei~etice rt~movec1&#xD;
the difficulty fn ref~euce to Captain Leon-&#xD;
ard's impris6nmeiit, and he was thrust like&#xD;
Paul' into the iuner dungeon, after being sev.-&#xD;
erely scoured by order of Captain Barhata,&#xD;
who was that day the officer in' charge of the&#xD;
post.&#xD;
Sandoval Ambrosia, a humane man, and&#xD;
one of the Alcaldes of the city, being in-&#xD;
formed of this barbarous treatment, first corn.-&#xD;
plained of it to Arista, and then visited the&#xD;
prisoner, whom he ordered to be brought forth&#xD;
into the light prison, when he had his back an-&#xD;
ointed, and a bed brought for his repose. H~&#xD;
afterwards sOnt him some palatable i-efreslt~&#xD;
ments, and did many other little thhi~s for his&#xD;
cotnfoi-t.&#xD;
The noit day~ General Martella's division&#xD;
entered the city, and encamped 'bn the Old&#xD;
Pifiza, and the day following the Tainpico&#xD;
Guards and Le Vega's Artillery arrived. And&#xD;
on~ the third, which was the 5e~enth before&#xD;
the battle of PalO Alto, all the troops at Ma.&#xD;
tamoras, to the number of about et~ht thbnsm-~&#xD;
and, were marshalled in the PisiM de Hidsd~&#xD;
go, to be revIewed the geuer~t-in-eliiet~&#xD;
On this occasion' G~neraI arista again t~&#xD;
spoke of the American soldiery, but rno1~ in&#xD;
the same contemptuouS terms used' on"the~eve-&#xD;
ning of the d~y of Captain Leonard's arrest.&#xD;
Now he carried his descd~tion tofli6 othen~&#xD;
extreme, and represented theta as a gigantic&#xD;
people, wit~h Tong' beards; strong arms, brave&#xD;
spirits, and~crnel hearts; in short, as barbar.-&#xD;
ianS, who kill~d,'rava~ed and ~onsumed from&#xD;

tam Leonard if he was ready to die, adding&#xD;
that in Mexico, if a prisoner, in an effort to&#xD;
escape, caused directly or indirectly the death&#xD;
of another person, he was accounted a mur-&#xD;
derer, and was punished accordingly.&#xD;
Captain Leonard replied that lie was in&#xD;
their power, and however unjust his condein-&#xD;
nation and punishment, he had not the power&#xD;
to prevent their execution. He then reques-&#xD;
ted a pen and paper thas he might indite a&#xD;
letter to General Taylor.&#xD;
At the mention of this name the officer&#xD;
smiled, and said-&#xD;
"You can .ave writing materials ifyou des-&#xD;
ire, and may write a dozen ~pistlesto the chief&#xD;
of the invaders, but they will avail you noth-&#xD;
ing, for it is General Aripta's intention to&#xD;
cross the river in a short time, perhaps on to.&#xD;
morrow, and drive the Army of Occupation&#xD;
beyond the Nueces."&#xD;
"With the force you nave marshalled on&#xD;
that ~'laza?" inquired Captain Leonard, con-&#xD;
temptuously.&#xD;
"That is a much greater force than the&#xD;
American army," replied Barbato.&#xD;
"But in the army of the Anglo-Saxon, es-&#xD;
pecially on this side of the Atlantic," replied&#xD;
Captain Leonard, "no inax~ is received who&#xD;
cannot whip his weight in #ld-cats."&#xD;
"The American is great boaster," returned&#xD;
the officer, "and bragadocia is an infallible&#xD;
sign of cowardice."&#xD;
"0 no, sir, the Americ~n is not a brag-&#xD;
gart," replied Captain Le~nard. "It would&#xD;
be no boast for General houston to say he&#xD;
conqueredd Santa Anna at S~n Jacinto. There&#xD;
is nothing the American ~ilI not undertake,&#xD;
and nothing he cannot accomplish."&#xD;
"Villain I" cried the officer, in a great pas-&#xD;
sion, "how dare you mention Houston and&#xD;
Sa~ J~cinto in my presence ?'~&#xD;
"I thought the recolleot~on of them might&#xD;
assist you to form a more ~~orrect conclusion&#xD;
iii 'reference to the power~ of the American&#xD;
soldiery," r.~glied Captain ~.eonard.&#xD;
"Barbarian," said the officer, "It is General&#xD;
Arista's intention to engage the army of Oc-&#xD;
cupation in open battle,~to defeat and disperse&#xD;
Its members, i~i~ capture its general, put out&#xD;
his eyes, and exnioit him throughout the lie-&#xD;
public of Mezico.~'&#xD;
&#xD;
"The man who is capable of such a deed,'&#xD;
returned the prisoner, "is worse than a bar.&#xD;
barian."&#xD;
"Dare you speak so of Mexico's favorite?'&#xD;
demanded Barbata, drawing his sword.&#xD;
"Would you strike a prisoner ?" said Ca?&#xD;
lain Leonard, stepping back towards tis&#xD;
wall.&#xD;
"I would thurst my sword through the&#xD;
arch-bishop himself, were he to apply such a&#xD;
term to Arista," replied the officer, striking&#xD;
at the face of the prisoner, and cutting away&#xD;
a portioii of his beard.&#xD;
"Brute I" exclaimed Captain Leonard,&#xD;
seizing a broken brick that lay on the sill&#xD;
of the window, and assuming an attitude of&#xD;
defence.&#xD;
"Do you defy me ?" said the enraged Bai&#xD;
bata, springing forward with his swors&#xD;
raised above his head, and his arm stretches'&#xD;
to its utmost capacity.&#xD;
Captain Leonard, compelled in order t~&#xD;
save his own life, hurled the brick at the ot&#xD;
fleer, and struck him full in the forehead, a~&#xD;
the ruddy faced stripling of Israel did tlu&#xD;
great' champion of the Phulistines, but in&#xD;
stead of the like fatal result the officer re&#xD;
ceived only a severe cut of several inches ii&#xD;
length, which laid the flesh open to lbs&#xD;
skull.&#xD;
Now Captain Barbata's rage knew nr~&#xD;
bounds, and had he not been blinded by the&#xD;
blo9d of the wound, the prisoner must ham&#xD;
lost his life.&#xD;
At length when the troops were all mar'&#xD;
shelled around the Plaza, with faces toWard&#xD;
the centre; when' Arista, sitting 'on horse.&#xD;
backing the midst of the square, had harran.&#xD;
gued them for an hour, descanting upon the&#xD;
prominent traits upon the American charac.&#xD;
ter, and portraying the death and deso.&#xD;
nation that would fall upon the Mexican peo'&#xD;
pie if their army was defeated ; when news of&#xD;
the injury received by Captain l3arbata had&#xD;
been officially received and in like' manner&#xD;
communicated to the army, with a false ac.&#xD;
count of the prison translation that placed&#xD;
Captain Leonard in a very unjcst light, y~t&#xD;
stimulated the curiosityy of the impatient sol-&#xD;
diery, Who had been promised a sight of the&#xD;
prisoner, Captain Costa was ordered to bring&#xD;
&#xD;
him forth, that he might be exhibited as a&#xD;
fair specimen of the people whom they were&#xD;
expected to meet and conquer.&#xD;
CHAPTER ~IL&#xD;
While Captain Costa was preparing the&#xD;
psison~t for exhibition, the troops were all&#xD;
faced about, and the general and his staff, all&#xD;
of whom were on horseback, leaving the cen-&#xD;
tre of the square, took a position immediately&#xD;
in front of the prison. The line of the troops&#xD;
was also extended, by marching them toward&#xD;
the houses that surrounded the square, and&#xD;
by reducing the number of ranks. When&#xD;
within thirty feet of the building they were&#xD;
caused to halt, this space being reserved for&#xD;
the passageof the prisoner and the mounted&#xD;
officers. By this arrangement the troops were&#xD;
enabled to obtain a close observation of&#xD;
captainn Leonard, while the citizens who oc~'&#xD;
cupied the pavements and balconies, were in&#xD;
dke manner gratified.&#xD;
At length every thing being in readiness,&#xD;
the prisoner was led forth bareheaded, with&#xD;
his hands bound behind his back, with a&#xD;
tope of several yards in length, each ~nd of&#xD;
which was firmly held in the hands of an~al-&#xD;
guazil, who walked behind. The position of&#xD;
the prisoner was in front of the procession, a&#xD;
politic arrangement of the general, who was&#xD;
excessively fond of admiration, and not choos&#xD;
to be rivalled by an American captive. He&#xD;
clearly perceived that if he and his suite rode&#xD;
.u front, anxiety would induce the beholders&#xD;
to look over their heads; whereas, on the&#xD;
contrary, if the prisoner was put foremost,&#xD;
after their curiosity was gratified, or the ob.&#xD;
ject of it beyond 'further observation, their&#xD;
eyes would then be turned admiringly upon&#xD;
their general and his splendid retinue.&#xD;
Captain Leonard left his prison under the&#xD;
apprehension of death, though the fear that&#xD;
filled his breast was not visible in his coun-&#xD;
tenance. He resolved to die as became an&#xD;
Amerkan, and moved forward with an~un-&#xD;
Jaunted step, and a look of defiance, which&#xD;
greatly enhanced the impression made by the&#xD;
general'~ 'representations.&#xD;
On leaving his cell, he observed that the&#xD;
balconies in front of the houses which sur-&#xD;
&#xD;
rounded the Plaza, were filled with persona&#xD;
of both sexes, whose curiosity was scarcely&#xD;
less than that of the soldiers and rabble;&#xD;
and the thought occurred to him that among&#xD;
&amp;amp;e ladies he might catch a glimpse of the&#xD;
sweet and beautiful face of Olinda Reda-&#xD;
mont.&#xD;
The city prison adjoined the old legislative&#xD;
hall on the north side, as the mansion of Mrs.&#xD;
Cathedra did on the opposite. Hence as, the&#xD;
prisolier first moved toward the north&#xD;
the curiosity of the handsome widow was the&#xD;
last to be gratified, though, perhaps, in con-&#xD;
sequence of the fright she had received~ it&#xD;
was more highly stimulated than any body's&#xD;
else.&#xD;
In front of the procession, to clean away&#xD;
all obstruction, a platform of musketeers.&#xD;
with fixed bayonets, and weapons to charge,&#xD;
were marched immediately before the prison-&#xD;
er, who was thus rendered conspicuous.&#xD;
That all might have an opportunity iso&#xD;
make a thorough examination, the procession&#xD;
was caused to move like a funeral, which en-&#xD;
abled the prisoner, not only to observe the&#xD;
countenances of those who filled the balconies,&#xD;
but to notice the appearance and equipage of&#xD;
the soldiery, among whom he most admired&#xD;
the two divisions henceforth specified, Le&#xD;
Vega's artillery and the Tampico guards.&#xD;
Captain Leonard was not a military mar~&#xD;
he lacked even the taste and judgment of an&#xD;
amateur; but the opinion formed of the troop.&#xD;
at that time, was fully confirmed by their&#xD;
subsequent deportment, especially at Resaca&#xD;
do Ia Palma, when the guards were the last&#xD;
to leave the field, and Li Vega was captured&#xD;
with a torch in his hand.&#xD;
There was not a female face visible at the&#xD;
windows or on the balconies that Captain&#xD;
Leonard did not 'closely scrutinize, but are-&#xD;
ong them all he nowhere beheld the fafr&#xD;
features of Olinda. lie had already~passed&#xD;
the north, the east, and the south sides of tto&#xD;
square, and so much ~f the west as lay norta&#xD;
of the barracks, without observing the objc~&#xD;
of his search, and he began to feel like one&#xD;
who treads alone a banquet hall deserted,&#xD;
There was yet one house to pass before he&#xD;
arrived, at~ the barracks. It did not occur Is&#xD;
him until they had passed all the otherfr&#xD;

death in any form, so long as there was&#xD;
Ir~peon earth cnn heaven-so long as there ii&#xD;
'was strength in his arm or efficacy in the (&#xD;
heartfelt prayer. n&#xD;
Captain Leonar~ was a man of good edu- n&#xD;
cation, wide experience, and extensive tra. ~&#xD;
vel; he had seen the beauty of many coun-&#xD;
tries, in Its most attractive guise, and wit- t&#xD;
messed, in almost every clime, the exquisite t&#xD;
pleasure and transcendent happiness of ma- ~&#xD;
trimnonial life; and yet lie had lived until his&#xD;
days were six-and-thirty years, without a de- ~&#xD;
gire to change his condition. But the sIght ~&#xD;
of beauty weeping on account of his mnis~ (&#xD;
fortune and misery, roused the latent affec.. I&#xD;
tiori of his heart, stimulated his ambition to I&#xD;
higher purposes, and determined his career&#xD;
of future usefulness.&#xD;
These reflections, though the consequence&#xD;
of an imaginary change in his situation, as&#xD;
will presently appear, had a beneficial effect 1&#xD;
upon the subsequent actions of Captain&#xD;
Leonard under very trying circumstances.&#xD;
On being reconducted to his prison, he in-&#xD;
quired of Captain Costa, with surprise th~&#xD;
cause of his recommitmeut~&#xD;
"Your exhibition," said Captain Costa&#xD;
' was all that was intended, as It was thought&#xD;
by the General that ~he sight of an A.nseri-&#xD;
can would Inspire the soldiery with addi-&#xD;
tional courage, whb~h be believed to be ne&#xD;
esssary; for notwithstanding his declare.~&#xD;
tions to the contrary, he knows that your&#xD;
army is composed of brave and daring men,.&#xD;
who fight for glory instead of gain, as Is not&#xD;
the case with too many of our own."&#xD;
"This is strange said Onpinin Leonard.&#xD;
"The unprincipled officer who first entered&#xD;
my prison this morning, told me to prepare&#xD;
for death, as I was first to ~e shown to the&#xD;
army and people. and then executed in their&#xD;
presence."&#xD;
"Captain Barbata, though a good officer&#xD;
In very many respeOts. has certain pecuhiari.&#xD;
r'es of expression and action, which are a~&#xD;
no time commendable, and under'certain cir~&#xD;
curnelances, perhaps inexcusable," replied&#xD;
'Capt'iin Costa, "yet I hardly think It the&#xD;
&#xD;
REVENGE&#xD;
I,&#xD;
ssur~ of evil principles, as your hasty remark&#xD;
rould seem to imply."&#xD;
* My remark was not hasty, nor a word of&#xD;
I uttered without consideration," returned&#xD;
)aptain Leonard. "Uisde~ortmenttoWad&#xD;
ne on all oc.casiofts, a1i~ especially on this&#xD;
riorning, has been as rude and cr~iel as your&#xD;
wa has been manly and gallant."&#xD;
He then went on to report the conversa-&#xD;
ion which passed between himself and Oap~&#xD;
am Barbata, and to describe the scene in&#xD;
ibich he had been victorious.&#xD;
"I do net doubt the truth svtyour r*labion,"&#xD;
aid Captain Costa, "although Barbata des.&#xD;
tribes the int.ereourse and encounter in very&#xD;
liffeient language. But his punishment, if&#xD;
iot greater than the occasion demanded, is&#xD;
nuch greater than I could have desired."&#xD;
"To what' extent Is. he injured?" inquired&#xD;
Daptain Leonard, with solicitude. "1 should&#xD;
~ot condemn my own action it' it had result.&#xD;
Bd in his death, for I think his attack would&#xD;
hive justified the destruction of life, yet I&#xD;
rejoice that it was spared, and hope he is not&#xD;
dangerously injured:"&#xD;
"Unless inflammation enanes, the Injury will&#xD;
not be fatal, though it must he confessed he&#xD;
is seriously hurt, so much so indeed, that&#xD;
weeks will pass before he will be able to re&#xD;
sume his duties."&#xD;
"I wish him a speedy recovery," said (lap.&#xD;
tam Leonard, "and that the injury which he&#xD;
this morning received may result in his refor.&#xD;
nation. There l~ one question which I ask.&#xD;
ed him that I will now ask youas he treated&#xD;
it with' indifference and insult,-whether I&#xD;
shall be perrtiitted tohave any communication&#xD;
with general l Taylor or the A.merican consul&#xD;
at this place?"&#xD;
"I presume there will be no objections,"&#xD;
replied Captain Costa, though your corn~&#xD;
inunication 'with the former eFould have to&#xD;
undergo inspection."&#xD;
"Such a precaution is highly prophet " said&#xD;
Captain Leonard. "I only desire to inform&#xD;
him of my situation, and to inquire if he&#xD;
possesses the means necessary to secure my&#xD;
deliverance "&#xD;
"I will make known yos~r i~equest to (~en-&#xD;
eral Arista, and in due time inftrui yoa ol&#xD;

ward the door.&#xD;
"And meantime," said Captain Leonard&#xD;
"I will prepare a Commtinicatiop.kif you wilt&#xD;
send me ink awl paper, and if ik is not ap-&#xD;
proved, it ean be destroyed."&#xD;
Upon the paper used in Mexico there is a&#xD;
~mp duty, which rendered it at that time&#xD;
very expensive, afact that Captain j4eonard&#xD;
was ignorant 4~f until long afterwards. But&#xD;
Gaptain Costa, whose deportipeni~ toward&#xD;
him had been courteous on all occasions, sus-&#xD;
pecting that he had been robbe~1 of his&#xD;
money as well as his ship and liberty, p~ir~&#xD;
chased for his use a case of writing materials&#xD;
and some ~ne white English paper, and sent&#xD;
them to him with a note informing him of&#xD;
arista's perinissiou~.-an act of kindness that&#xD;
was subsequently remembered to his sslvan.&#xD;
CHAPTER XIII.&#xD;
Having obtained the co~isent of the Mex-&#xD;
ican. General, Captain Leonard opened the&#xD;
writing desk sent hint by the kind.hearted&#xD;
Captain Costa, and taking from .it a sheet of&#xD;
paper, wrote a brief note to the American&#xD;
Consul at that place, requesting an interview.&#xD;
This he dispatched open by a messenger, feel-&#xD;
ing assured that it would~never reach its ~is~s-&#xD;
tination unexamined. Re then returned lo&#xD;
the desk and wrote a long letter to General&#xD;
Taylor, to whom he recounted all the events&#xD;
that had passed from the time he left New&#xD;
Orleans up to the moment of the writing.&#xD;
This letter he folded ~aud addressed to the&#xD;
Commander of the Army of Occupation, but&#xD;
left it unsealed that it might be examined&#xD;
before it was ~forwarded.&#xD;
He had jn4t completed his h~bors, when&#xD;
Mr. 8hatsell,1~he American Consul, was an-&#xD;
uounced, Ca~iu Leonard immediately arose&#xD;
sand extended is hand to the red faced, round&#xD;
.bellied old man who stood at the door of his&#xD;
pajsou. After the usual salutations, Captain&#xD;
Leonard apologized for having troubled him&#xD;
on his own account, but that he f9und his&#xD;
loneliness so oppressi~~and his confinement&#xD;
.$0 ineu~pportabIe, that he was anxious if there&#xD;
~was any way in his power, to obtain his ii-&#xD;
oration.&#xD;
&#xD;
Mr. Shateell assured him that he was ao~&#xD;
aware of his capture until that morning, ba~&#xD;
ing suspended his official relations with the&#xD;
government doinicil. But that on that&#xD;
morning he had come ont to witness the re.&#xD;
review of the army, and wae painfully sur.&#xD;
priced at the sight of a fellow countryman ~&#xD;
bonds and upon exhibition. And that he&#xD;
had obtained permission to visit him in hii&#xD;
confinement, and inquire the circumstances&#xD;
connected with his iniprisonmefit.&#xD;
Captain Leonard thanked him very warr~&#xD;
ly for his disinterested sympathy, adding, "I&#xD;
am delighted to see you, even if it is not in&#xD;
your power to relieve me. This solitary&#xD;
confinement is not endurable."&#xD;
"My dear sir,.-my countryman," said Mr.&#xD;
Shatsell, earnestly, laying his hand upon the&#xD;
knee of the prisoner, "I should have called&#xD;
upon you and done all in my power to relieve&#xD;
your necessities and protect you from insult&#xD;
and abuse, if I had inly known you were&#xD;
here. But as I have already said, I was first&#xD;
aware of the fact this morning."&#xD;
"Is there anything you can do toward af-&#xD;
fectin~ my liberation?" inquired Captain&#xD;
Leonard. "I am anxious to be at liberty.".&#xD;
"I presume I can do nothing to secure your&#xD;
permanent liberty," replied the Consul.&#xD;
"Thejhold you as a prisoner of war, and my&#xD;
official capacitica are all civil. However, I&#xD;
may relieve you of your confinement, if you~&#xD;
will accept a parol.&#xD;
"That I will do witb pleasure under the&#xD;
circumstances," replied Captain Leonard.&#xD;
"Indeed, as for the matter of that, I may&#xD;
considermyself in that situation at the pre.&#xD;
sent moment. You see those wooden bars;&#xD;
well, it would not be difficult for meto break&#xD;
them and enjoy the liberty I so much desire.&#xD;
But I could not remain in 'this city if my&#xD;
liberation was thus obtained, and I should&#xD;
rather remain in this prison than be compels&#xD;
ed to fly to Texas.&#xD;
"Whatl" exclaimed the Consul, surprised&#xD;
"prefer ~m Mexican prison to the wide prairies&#xD;
of free Texas, and you an American?"&#xD;
Captain Leonard was about to confess his&#xD;
love fo~ the unknown beauty where commi.&#xD;
seration had ~o excited his love, as the only&#xD;
way to satisf~ the surprised Consul, wh~ was&#xD;

rilE RAI~GER'~ REVENGE~&#xD;
&#xD;
en the verge of indignation, when the kinc&#xD;
mess of the arcade occurred to his mind, auc&#xD;
he made It the excuse for the supposed pro&#xD;
ference.&#xD;
"You very much mistake the nature of m~&#xD;
choice," replied the captain. '~Liberty an~&#xD;
where is preferable to Imprisonment an~&#xD;
where, But even a Mexican prison is to bc&#xD;
preferred to a dishonorable liberation. I~&#xD;
other words, if a prisoner, through the kind.&#xD;
ness of a friend is taken from a lonely aed&#xD;
loathsome dungeon, and given the liberty o~&#xD;
a large and light apartment, with the implied&#xD;
condition that he will not attempt to escape&#xD;
Is he not justified, as a man of honor, in pro'&#xD;
- fearing his confinement?"&#xD;
"He is, most assuredly;" replied the Consul&#xD;
with a warmth of manner that made the ob-&#xD;
serving Captain suspect his southern origin.&#xD;
'But this is a condition in your case with&#xD;
which I was not acquainted, fly whose&#xD;
kindness do you enjoy the air and light?"&#xD;
"My benefactor is one of the alcades of the&#xD;
aity,' but I do not recollect his name," re-&#xD;
plied Captain L~onard. "He is a mat~ per-&#xD;
naps above the medium height, but exceed-&#xD;
tn~ly meagre, resembling a corpse more than&#xD;
.a living animal. But he has a beaming eye&#xD;
a tender tone, thatgave me a more favor-&#xD;
abl~ impression than I could otherwise have&#xD;
forced of one that strongly reminded me of&#xD;
mean -Sandival&#xD;
a ~c~rs skeleton." Ambrosia," said Mr.&#xD;
Shatsell, and he is every way worthy of the&#xD;
good opinion you have formed of him. He is&#xD;
unive~ally respected among his own people,&#xD;
and is my favorite. I like him very much.&#xD;
He is a gentleman and a scholar. He has&#xD;
travelled in our country, and has a high&#xD;
opinion of our people. You will value his&#xD;
acquaintance."&#xD;
"I trust I have a just appreciation of his&#xD;
kindness, which was entirely voluntary," said&#xD;
Captain Leonard, "and I long to be at liber-&#xD;
ty that I may make the proper acknowledge.&#xD;
ments br his disinterested benevolence."&#xD;
"I certainly wish it was in my power to&#xD;
procure ~'our li'berty," said the consul, with&#xD;
regret; "but I cannot see how I am to serve&#xD;
you in this respect. It may be that Gener-&#xD;
alTaylor, ifinformed of your situation, could&#xD;
&#xD;
1,&#xD;
&#xD;
I do something for y9mr relief. I know he will&#xD;
I if it is in his power"&#xD;
"I had just coucluded a comm~inieatio,~ to&#xD;
him before you arrived," said Capt. Leonard.&#xD;
"So then, you had no ~monfidenc&amp;amp;in my&#xD;
assistance after all?" said the consul.&#xD;
"You cannot think so if you received ray&#xD;
letter," replied Captain L~onard.&#xD;
"Your letter.?" replied the consul. "Why,&#xD;
I saw no letter from you."&#xD;
"I dispatched one to you an hour before&#xD;
this was concluded," said Captain Leonard,&#xD;
placing the end of his finger upon the letter&#xD;
before him, "and supposed you came hither&#xD;
at my request."&#xD;
"No, my son, I came -of my own free will&#xD;
and accord," replied the consul. "lam grat-&#xD;
ified that you sought my assistance. It does&#xD;
my soul good to aid one that I know will ap-&#xD;
preciate my kindness."&#xD;
"And I am more highly gratified that you&#xD;
came of your own choice," replied Captain&#xD;
Leonard.&#xD;
"Well, well, my son, it seems to have tur-.&#xD;
ned out to our mutual advantage," said Mr.&#xD;
Shateell. "But enough of this. Let me see&#xD;
your letter to General Taylor. You need&#xD;
not hesitate to show it to me, for it will be&#xD;
read by the Mexican General, or In his pres-&#xD;
ence, before it will be dispatched to Corpus&#xD;
Christi."&#xD;
"It was my intention to submit it for your&#xD;
perusal and approval," said Captain Leon.&#xD;
ard. "And if you think it will be any ad~.&#xD;
vantage, I should also like to have your ceu'~&#xD;
tificate, in your official capacity, to anthem.&#xD;
ticate as many of the statements as are with.&#xD;
in your knowledge."&#xD;
So saying, he .himnded the letter to Mr.&#xD;
Shateell, ~vho read it carefully throughout,&#xD;
and at the conclusion expressed his approba&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"There is one thing that might as well&#xD;
have been omitted," said the consul, "and&#xD;
they may require you to expunge it, and&#xD;
that is the description of your ~naltreab~&#xD;
ment.~'  -     -&#xD;
"I have thought as much myself," replied&#xD;
Captain Leonard; "but it will be an east&#xD;
thing to make the alteration."&#xD;

he resolved tosubinit without opposition.&#xD;
At the close of the above conver~ation~&#xD;

In obedience to the directions of his saipe.&#xD;
nor, the soldier, who boasted the rank and&#xD;
authorit~y of a Sergeant, set about the rueces.&#xD;
sary preparations for the journey. To this&#xD;
end he produceda long rope, and with the&#xD;

Oa~talnBarbata, on leaving the prison,&#xD;
had mounted his horse which a servent held&#xD;
at th~ door, and rode at an ambling pace to'&#xD;
thO other end of the city, where he entered~&#xD;
the max'ket placeand'paused at the door of&#xD;
Valarequier Roniano. H~ knoOked againstt&#xD;
the door with th~hntt of hit whip, and im~&#xD;
immediately it was opened by a ~ex'vant, who&#xD;
led the horse into the house directly after hie&#xD;
master had entered, and through to the gar..&#xD;
den, wher~lie: was secured to a post for that&#xD;
kind of purpose~&#xD;
Another Servant conducted the officer to&#xD;
the presence of Ronuano, who was sitting in&#xD;
asrnall side room, in the center of. which&#xD;
stood srtablecovered witha white linen cloth,&#xD;
containing dishes: and victuals for their sup.'&#xD;

officer, extended his band in welcome, ,w&#xD;
showd him to a seat at the table.&#xD;
&#xD;
Every thingha.ving been so prepared as to&#xD;

who had conducted the captain hither was&#xD;
immediately dismissed, with order to remain&#xD;
within hearing of tue bell. But servants&#xD;
not unfrequently, when not permitted to go&#xD;
as far as inclination prompts, remain much&#xD;
nearer than is altogether desirable.&#xD;
Thus the young man who was banished&#xD;
froih the presence of his master and bisinas-&#xD;

'But how many people-.--you can certainly&#xD;

"At least s~hundred," answered Barbata~&#xD;
"The devils" exclaimed the merchant, sun~&#xD;
poised. "Why, Who?"&#xD;
"I know net- who all," replied the officer,&#xD;
"there are at least thirty families represent.&#xD;
"Who?-who?" cried t~oinanno eagerly.&#xD;
"The families of Genres, Menehaea, (~hap.&#xD;

"And is Maregnanara among t~e number?'&#xD;

"Curse the lucki" cried the urerchant~ ex-&#xD;

"A hi indeedV' exclaimed the officer. "Why&#xD;
what difference can she znakel"&#xD;
"More than you can imagine," replied Re-&#xD;
macno; but not wishing to be interrogated,&#xD;
he quickly added an inquiry, that required an&#xD;
answer and a change in the subject of com-&#xD;
munication. "By wlmatmeans doyou expect&#xD;
to detach her from thecompany?"&#xD;
"Who, the widow?" inquired Barbata.&#xD;
"No, curse the widow, and you too if you&#xD;
don't forget her this moment," answered&#xD;
Romanno. "I mean Andronita."&#xD;
"Oh! I scarcely. know," replied the officer&#xD;
"I think I have fQrined no plan as yet. I&#xD;
shall endeavor toenlist t'eron in the matter.&#xD;
He will go as far for money as I will for&#xD;
revenge, and that you know is not a little&#xD;

"lie will, truety," replied liomanno, "bat&#xD;

Barbata.&#xD;
"He is bet~rothed to hen, but in love with&#xD;
Andronita," returned Itomanno.&#xD;
"I can't admire his preference," said liar..&#xD;
bata, "for Olinda is greatly the superior'."&#xD;
"Say so where and when you will but in&#xD;

dais a superior woman when compared with&#xD;
most Of hSe sex, but Andronita is withouta&#xD;
peer."&#xD;
"1 have thought of no other plan than the&#xD;
subvention of Peron," and Captain Barbata,&#xD;
resuming the subject in hand. "But if your&#xD;
in&amp;amp;~rmatlon is correct, some other must be&#xD;
axed upon. Perhaps Mortior may be con-~&#xD;
trolled?"&#xD;
"Scarcely, if he is of Peron's comniand,"&#xD;

surprised. "Why, for what are they prison-&#xD;

"Is ltpossibleyou have not hear4?" replied&#xD;
the officer. "They were this morning arres-&#xD;

"This is fortunate," said Romanno: "It&#xD;
will enable na to manage the thing without&#xD;
difficulty. A feigned attack upon Mortior's&#xD;
command will bring Peron to his assistance.&#xD;
when a rush among the women and children&#xD;
will enable you to carry off Andronita."&#xD;
"I do not altogether like the plan, for it is&#xD;
attended with too much daK~ger," replied Bar-&#xD;
bata. "I am of the opinion, that by joining&#xD;
the party with the 4merican, I shall escape&#xD;
suspicion; and having gained the confidence&#xD;
of Peron and &amp;amp;tortior, shall find little dUll"&#xD;

off Andronita during to-morrow night."&#xD;
"Perhaps that will be better," ~aid Ro-&#xD;
manno, thoughtfully. "At any rate, I see&#xD;
notl4ng preferable at the present moment.-&#xD;
But it is time we were under way, or they&#xD;
wrn get toO much the start."&#xD;
"No fear of that, for they must necessarily&#xD;
travel slow," replie~l Barbata. But unless I&#xD;
get the prisoner beyond the city to night, I&#xD;
shall stand but a slim chance for revepge;-&#xD;
Even if the Americans do not come and set&#xD;
him at liberty, Ambrosia will protect him&#xD;
against me until he is exchanged."&#xD;
"Well, if you have finished your supper,&#xD;
there is nothing to detain you," said Roman-&#xD;
no. "The Men I promised to furnish, are in&#xD;
the court ready to set out ata moments warn-&#xD;

"Then, the sooner we are off the better,"&#xD;
said Barbata, rising from the table.&#xD;
"Where is the General's order?" inquired&#xD;
Bomanno, with a smile.&#xD;
"Here," answered the captain, touching&#xD;
the breast of his coat opposite his waistcoat&#xD;
pocket,&#xD;
"Give it me," said Romanno.&#xD;
Ba~bata deliberately unbuttoned his coat,&#xD;

F BRIDE; OR,&#xD;
the order was in none of themat least it was&#xD;

"I certainly put it in this pocket," he ra&#xD;
marked, feeling again in the pocke which he&#xD;
had first examined. "It is not here! I must&#xD;
have lost it."&#xD;
"That is very unfortunate," se~id Romanno,&#xD;
quickly, "for it defeats all our purposes."&#xD;
"It cau't effect them at all," replied Bar-&#xD;
bata. "The ~order has done its work; it has&#xD;
procured us the control of the prisoner."&#xD;
"But it is a forgery, and if evil befals the&#xD;
prisoner, will easily be detected, and the deed&#xD;
may be fixed upon its rightful perpetrator,"&#xD;
returned Romanno. "Though the signature&#xD;
is good enough no deceive the prefect, Arista&#xD;
would detect the imposition, for he would&#xD;
know he never executed such an order. So,&#xD;
through your carelessness both our plans are&#xD;
frustrated, and our most cherished purposes&#xD;
defeated."&#xD;
"There is nothing to prevent the progreu&#xD;

"N~othing but the tess of the order~" re-&#xD;
plied Romanno.&#xD;
"That is a small matter," said the officer,&#xD;
contemptuously.&#xD;
"It involves my honor," said the merchant,&#xD;
man excited tone, "and unless it is recover-&#xD;
ed, nothing further shall be done. I can ef-&#xD;
feet my purpose in some other way."&#xD;
"It may be sticking in some corner of my,&#xD;
pocket," said Barbata, renewing the exami-&#xD;
nation.&#xD;
It will be perceived from the foregoing&#xD;
conversation, that the officer and merchant&#xD;
had entered into an agreement, each to assist&#xD;
the other in carrying out a favorite object.&#xD;
The conditions of that agreement were brief-&#xD;
ly, that Romauno, being an excelnt pensman&#xD;
and acquainted with Arista' s signature,&#xD;
should forge an order apon the city prefect&#xD;
for the delivery of the American into the&#xD;
custody of Barbata, and furnish a company&#xD;
of fifty men to carry hire beyond the city to&#xD;
a place of security; and for this service Bar-&#xD;
bata was to sieze Andronita Rappello on hew&#xD;
way to Victoria, and carry her off toward&#xD;
the mountains, where Romanno should suds&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
49&#xD;
&#xD;
denly cross his path, and rescue her from her&#xD;
fancied danger,&#xD;
Romanno purposed no wrr~ beyond the&#xD;
mere abduction. He loved .&amp;amp;ndronita-lov-&#xD;
ed her almost to dis~rac~tion; but his love was&#xD;
not reciprocated. Until he saw her, he had&#xD;
loved the widow Cathedra; but the beautiful&#xD;
widow had no chafins for his eyes after they&#xD;
had once dwelt upon the angelic countenance&#xD;
of the adorable Andronita.&#xD;
It was on the day of Captain Leonard's&#xD;
exhibition to the Mexican soldiery and popu-&#xD;
lace, that he first beheld this lovely creature.&#xD;
She was standing at the north end of the&#xD;
widow's Balcony, in the half concealed atti-&#xD;
ude described many pages back, and the tears&#xD;
f compassion were trickling down her dim-&#xD;
led cheeks, and falling softly, one after an-&#xD;
ther, upon her heaving bosom. Jim atten~&#xD;
on had been directed toward her by the ad-&#xD;
iring gaze of the prisoner, and the discove-&#xD;
y of such angelical sweetness and beauty&#xD;
netantly inspired him with love for the mai-&#xD;
en and hate for the unfortunate being whose&#xD;
tuitionn had called forth her tears.&#xD;
But scarcely had he discovered the lovely&#xD;
n~#nita, when Mrs. Cathedra, who leaned&#xD;
pon his arm, claimed his attention, and di-&#xD;
ted it toward some object in quite a differ.&#xD;
ot direction. Much against his desire he&#xD;
implied with her request, but as soon as he&#xD;
ould without attracting her notice and excit.&#xD;
g her jealousy, turned his eyes again toward&#xD;
e spot where he had seen the ethereal beau-&#xD;
* But to his surprise and vexation, she&#xD;
one, and before he could free himself from&#xD;
e widow, she had left the mansion.&#xD;
Romanno was too deeply enamored not to&#xD;
ake some exertions to discover the object&#xD;
his love, and he was not long in obtaining&#xD;
a desired information, and what he prized&#xD;
en more, an introduction. As already said,&#xD;
was wealthy and very generally respected;&#xD;

But to his surprise~ .Audronita Rapello&#xD;

&#xD;
tered. She described his hehavior as perU.&#xD;
dious. She refused to hear a contrast be~&#xD;
tween he~ own and the wid~w's beauty. She&#xD;
told him plainly that if he was not bound t.&#xD;
another lady the sacred promise of matrinno-&#xD;
nialallianceshe could not love him. In abort,&#xD;
she repulsed him winhreproaches, and threat-&#xD;
ened to discover his faithlessness to his be&#xD;
trothed.&#xD;
]1~~manno insisted that it was not his fault&#xD;
that he admired her beauty; any other person&#xD;
must have done as much. Of conree he was&#xD;
to blame for having confessed his foolish love;&#xD;
but he was impetuous, and the hope of win.&#xD;
ning ~o fair an angel ought to excuse even&#xD;
a greater indiscretion. He begged that she&#xD;
would not expose this love passage, but on&#xD;
the contrary give it consideration; he had the&#xD;
vanity to hope if she could realize the depth.~&#xD;
of his love, she would regard him with favor.&#xD;
To all of which the maiden replied, that.&#xD;
the charaeler of his love could make no dif-&#xD;
ference with her, because she loved another&#xD;
But to his inquiries concerning her love, and&#xD;
more particularly if it was reciprocated, she.&#xD;
refused an answer.&#xD;
Romauno found it impossible to elicit an~j&#xD;
thing beyond her ingenuous confidence. 0&#xD;
other persons he made inquiry, but gained n~&#xD;
information which could assist him to a rolls&#xD;
ble conclusion. Among the youth of tha&#xD;
city, many had heard of her beauty, but until&#xD;
the day of Captain Leonard's exhibition, n~&#xD;
one had ever beheld her, so carefully had she&#xD;
been guarded from their gaze, in the quiet of:&#xD;
her rural nome.&#xD;
The merchant was of the opinion, that if~&#xD;
hecould render her some signal service, it&#xD;
would make such a deep impression on her~&#xD;
mind, that gratitude would assist her in the&#xD;
accomplishment of his purpose.. And with&#xD;
this object in view, he entered into the agree-&#xD;
ment with Barbata.&#xD;

upon ~the chit~chat of a group of young niai-&#xD;

the sleepers, "that that hateful American is&#xD;

"Don't be alarmed," cried a maiden quick.&#xD;

the horses, the sentinels, all were visible; of&#xD;
coarse not so distinctly as at mid-day, but&#xD;
much to~ plain for one who would escape&#xD;
unobserved.&#xD;
It was necessary to reflect and to plan;&#xD;
for which no place seemed so secure as the&#xD;
very spot he occupied. lie sat still there-&#xD;
(ore, and considered. Many courses sug.&#xD;
gested themselves, but nonc seamed feasible,&#xD;
save one, and in it there was murder.&#xD;
To steal upon the sleeping sentinel, to&#xD;
throttle, stran~lO, and disarm, would require&#xD;
but a moment, forone of Captain Leonard'0&#xD;
strengthot nerve and muscle. But foraught&#xD;
he knew, that sentinel had cut his thongs,&#xD;
and now feigned sleep. He thought of&#xD;
Liewellen's hound-and the sentinel slept&#xD;
In security.&#xD;
While he lingered, doubting, the shadow&#xD;
of a person passed alopg the ground before&#xD;
him and was lost in the broader shadow of&#xD;
the neighboritig tree. At 'the~ame moment&#xD;
a man came out eta tent, dressed even to the&#xD;
cap, and looked steadfastly for several 'se-&#xD;
conde toward the prisoner. But the shadow&#xD;
and substance had no connection; the former&#xD;
had a substance and the latter a shadow of&#xD;
its own. The shadowi~of the substance lay&#xD;
beyond the prisoner's view, and the substance&#xD;

"It maybe my only opportunity," persist-&#xD;

"It is better that you should not kuow~'&#xD;
said the maiden, earnestly, "for kindness has&#xD;
betrayed a secret already."&#xD;
"You allude to the misfortune of Olinda,"&#xD;
returned Captain Leonard. "What I did&#xD;
was very foolish, I must admit; but I seldom&#xD;
repeat an imprudence."&#xD;
"But you sometimes commit new ones,"&#xD;
said'the liberator~ "You have tarried until&#xD;

Further converse was impracticable, for&#xD;
Burbata was nbw within~rshot. He came&#xD;
not forward boldly as a brave man of honest&#xD;
intentions; but stole along the ground with&#xD;
the'noiseless tread o~ a cat, and approached&#xD;
the prisoner in the tree's shadow. Within a'&#xD;

cogitate.&#xD;
"He is alseep," said the officer, "and the&#xD;

This order Ituparted scarcelygr~at~r plea-.&#xD;

General Ta$or~ respecting Captai~ Leonar4,&#xD;
but as ha was ~Iready at li~~ty~hey are of&#xD;
little conaequen~e.&#xD;
As soon as all these fade were published,&#xD;
preparations were made, and the parties se..-&#xD;
parated; Peron, with those under his charge,&#xD;
journeying forward, and Mortior taking&#xD;
charge of those who returned, Each party&#xD;
reached its destination withoUt unusual trou-&#xD;
ble or deisy, though it was nearly midnight&#xD;
when the latter arr~ived.&#xD;
A~ this party approached Matamoras, a&#xD;
circ~inrntancO occurred that caused some ap.&#xD;
prehension. They were challenged by the&#xD;
American pickets, stationed near the ruin of&#xD;
an old fort, a short distance south of the&#xD;
city. Great excitement prevailed, and but&#xD;
for Olinda, *bo explained the challenge to&#xD;
Mortior, dispersion and flight would have&#xD;
ensued.&#xD;
The sentinel oir duty at this post, charged&#xD;
with strict orde~~s*hich be dare not disobey&#xD;
called for the officer in charge of the picket&#xD;
guard, giving his number, which indicated&#xD;
his position, an4 enabled the offleer, whoever&#xD;
be happened to he when the call reached his&#xD;
ears, to proceed directly to the post from&#xD;
which tJie alarm proceeded.&#xD;
The next sentinel, on each hand, repeated&#xD;
the words, and in a very few minutes, the&#xD;
otUcer arrive~i. A few words from Olinda&#xD;
explained everything, and all save Mortior&#xD;
and his command were suII~rcd to pass.&#xD;
'These, by order of General Taylor, were die.&#xD;
armed, but permitted to return to their&#xD;
homes~&#xD;
This little circumstance, so dithrent from&#xD;
anything they had expected, notwithstanding&#xD;
the assuranCe of the prefect, inspired cone-&#xD;
denee and respect. And this confidence and&#xD;
respect were never forfeited, although the&#xD;
three mouths' t~6lunteers culled into service&#xD;
by GeneralGaines, did very many thingeoct&#xD;

In the evening twilight .f the third daS&#xD;

troops. Immediately the gnard were sum.&#xD;

had scarcely less to fear from guerillas, large&#xD;
partiesof whom infested that region of Ta-&#xD;
maulipas, and plundered all who were not&#xD;
strong enough to make successful resistance.&#xD;
The commander of the approaching party2&#xD;
$serving the warike attitude of the other,&#xD;
called a halt~ and dispatched a messenger to&#xD;
communicate with Captain Peron; it proved&#xD;
to be Romanno and his lahorers~ whom he&#xD;
had arAed to make sum the capture of An.&#xD;
dronita. With the mention of one other&#xD;
fact, the merchant will be left to explain his&#xD;
presence and the armed condition of his&#xD;
people, as shall accord with his mativesof&#xD;
propriety.&#xD;
The night upon which he and Barbata had&#xD;
ooncoct~d a plan for the capture of Andre.&#xD;
nitnand the destruction of the American, as&#xD;
soon as the latter had departed, he called to&#xD;
iris servant and gave orders for his rancheros&#xD;
to prepare for the march.&#xD;
A little before daybreak he left the city,&#xD;
by a road and direction different from that&#xD;
pursued by the parties hitherto mentioned1&#xD;
and by a circuitous route, gained a designate .&#xD;
e4 point fifty milee 'rem the city, by the&#xD;

cause of the 4isappq~ntment.&#xD;

conclusion, apd most of iris men had retired&#xD;
to rest for the night; but h~ wa~ a man at&#xD;
promptitude~rd energy~ and allowed nothing&#xD;
that might be controlled to interfere, with'&#xD;
his arrangements; so he roused his men, ~nd&#xD;
set forward to the accomplishment of hie&#xD;
purpose.&#xD;
"The same night you left the city," said&#xD;
aemanno to Perongivinga different version&#xD;
of the facts above recorded, "I received a&#xD;
letter from my steward at santa Barbara,&#xD;
informing me that a body of guerillas nuder&#xD;
the command of the infamous Gotama, had&#xD;
visIted my ranch and carried off much val-&#xD;
uable property. I immediately sumlironed&#xD;
of my laborers as were in the city,&#xD;
and h tened thithet,, in the hope that I&#xD;
recover my property and punish the&#xD;
offenders.&#xD;
"On arrir~alX found that they had fted&#xD;
in this direction, and I immediately gave&#xD;
pursuit. All day long we followed theul In&#xD;
their precipitate flight~ and at sundown the&#xD;
next day was in full view of them, we being&#xD;
on the hills east of the road, and they in tbe~&#xD;

the first night, distant about two leagues.&#xD;
"We must have perceived each other at&#xD;
the same moment, fur they suddenly increased&#xD;
their speed, And dashed away asiC the send&#xD;
of destruction was upon their track. The&#xD;
chase was vigorously x~aintained and we&#xD;

solved to renew the chase as soon as it was&#xD;
light enough to discover the course pursued&#xD;
ay the fugitives.&#xD;
"in the morning we were completely be--&#xD;

the robbers had disp~rs~d, and every one&#xD;
taking a course of their own, no trace was&#xD;

fix upon their course, the pursuit was ahan--&#xD;
doned.&#xD;
"Shortly 4ter a' solitary footman was&#xD;
observed farther down the valley, and a cou.-&#xD;
plc of men were dispatched to inquire of him&#xD;
respecting the guerila. But as soon as he&#xD;
noticed their approach, he turned and fled&#xD;
at the top of his speed; whereupon I imme-&#xD;
diately' ordered a general pursuit.&#xD;
"The fugitive bent his' course toward the&#xD;
hills,,and so rapid was his flight, that our&#xD;
utmost exertions were not sufficient to pre-&#xD;
vent the attainment of his object. A score&#xD;
of my followers at once dismounted, and con--&#xD;
tinned the chase on foot, but their best ef--&#xD;

taking.&#xD;
"The reckk~ss daring of the fugitive I&#xD;
have never seen equaled., Ynightful chasma&#xD;
that his pursuers dared not approach he&#xD;
cleared at a bound, with the ease and grace&#xD;
of the mountain goat. Prom rpcks that&#xD;
crumbled beneath his weight, he would leap&#xD;
to a firmer foothold. And by means of&#xD;
shrubs not strong enough to support one half&#xD;
his weight, he would ascend or descend at&#xD;
pleasure, and u~ith perfect s&amp;amp;,urity&#xD;
"Perceiving the impossibility of his cap.&#xD;
tune by direct pursuit, I ordered those of my&#xD;
iollo~ers who were on horseback, to ascend&#xD;
the valley for half a league, and then dis--&#xD;
mouxit and intercept his course. The move~&#xD;
ment was successful,!though an hour and up.&#xD;
wards were consumed in the effort. But the&#xD;
capture was worth the exertion&#xD;
This narrative was made lathe presence&#xD;
of all those under Peron's protection, and&#xD;
was listened to with lively interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
Who is the captain I" inquired Perom~&#xD;
eagerly.&#xD;
"Captain Leonard," replied R~manno.&#xD;
An hour before the widow Cathedra bad&#xD;
expressed her joy at the American's escape:&#xD;
but her accustomed cheerfulness had scarcely&#xD;
returned before he was again in their midst.&#xD;
At the mention of his name she shrieked and&#xD;
shuddered as if she really felt the4ear she&#xD;
affected. Romanno flew to her Eide and en--&#xD;
deavored to allay her apprehensions.&#xD;
"My love," said he, "be not afraid, he is&#xD;
bound."&#xD;
"Your love," cried the widow, forgetting&#xD;
the part sh. was playing in her eagerness&#xD;
to manif~'st her indignation, "how dare you&#xD;
address me in such terms, after what has&#xD;
transpired ?"&#xD;
"I must, beg to be enlightened before I&#xD;
can answer," returned the merchant.&#xD;
"Its very easy to affect Ignorance," said&#xD;
the widow, angrily, "but it don't always&#xD;
answer the purpose intended."&#xD;
"I am not conscious of having done&#xD;
anything to merit your displeasure," said&#xD;
Romanno.&#xD;
" it nothing to violate your troth--&#xD;

creased anger.&#xD;
"I do assure you," began the merchant-.-&#xD;
"I will hear none of~your assurances," in-&#xD;
terrupted the widow. "I have listened to&#xD;
too many already for my own peace of&#xD;
mind."&#xD;
"If you would but listen a moment," en-&#xD;
treated Ro4ltnno, "everything would be ex-&#xD;

Contrary to their expectatierle and wishes&#xD;
Captain Leonard ~nd~ Lienteuant Ricardo&#xD;
were placed in different cells, and werO net&#xD;
permitted to hold the least communicatiou&#xD;
with each other4&#xD;
Thediingeon in which the American was&#xD;
cO~ilhi~d, was situated under one extren~e&#xD;
&amp;amp;6rne~ of the castle, and from its thick stole&#xD;
walls and damp, disagreeable atniospher~,&#xD;
he Wee led to judge that itwas many feet be-&#xD;
low the surface of the earth. The w~1ls were&#xD;
of a grayish cast and from the fact that in&#xD;
many places it was grown over with nioss&#xD;
and other ~dndergroun4 vegetation, Ii could&#xD;
tell that many ~years had passed since the&#xD;
structure had been founded. Captain Leon-&#xD;
ard was no poetic dreamer, and scarcely eyer&#xD;
allowed his imagination to get the better of&#xD;
his love for the realities of life; but he was a&#xD;
man of tasts--and although ofroughexterior,&#xD;
* he possessed a mind, which in one sense of&#xD;
the word, was well ceitivated, His reading,&#xD;
and knowledge of the world w~s extensive,&#xD;
and he prided himself much on his knowledge&#xD;
of human nature.&#xD;
It is not strange thOn, thut the gloomy ~..&#xD;
peat of his prison should recall to his mind,&#xD;
many events which had mark~'d the history&#xD;
of Mexico, in other days. The old castle&#xD;
was evidently a relic of times past and gone;&#xD;
and Captain Leonard thought if it coul4&#xD;
only spealr~ might "a tale unfold," c~ncorn-&#xD;
ing tire history and fall of the western world.&#xD;
Ills rniii&amp;amp; ran back into the aboriginal Iris.&#xD;
to~'y of the country, at th&amp;amp; time when the&#xD;
glory of the Antecs, was at its height. And&#xD;
as he xnueed upon their then happy un4.&#xD;
flourishing empire, which was . destined&#xD;
shortly to fall beneath the power of Hernan.~&#xD;
do Cortes and his steel clad followers, he felt&#xD;
inclined to drop a tear of regret that the&#xD;
~and of ambition had been suffered to con&#xD;
quer.&#xD;
In this manner the day passed by, and,&#xD;
right came slowly on. This fact he was en.&#xD;
abledto ascert~In from a small aperture at&#xD;
one side of his cell, through which a faiti&#xD;
&#xD;
7'&#xD;
&#xD;
sinsak of light was enabled to penetrate.&#xD;
With the night, came thoughts of escape,&#xD;
and he arose from his hardcouch in order&#xD;
to scan the appearance of things about him.&#xD;
He had at different times during his lmpri~&#xD;
sonment in Mexico, discovered some of the&#xD;
many secrets of their architects, and hell~ti~&#xD;
doubted, but that there were some secret&#xD;
springs connected with his dungeon, besid~&#xD;
the one at which he had entered. With these&#xD;
thoughts in his mind he arose to hie feet audi&#xD;
conunence~l a diligent survey of the apart.&#xD;
merit. After spending near an half an hour&#xD;
in search, which proved unsuccessful, he was&#xD;
about to relinquish all further effort when&#xD;
his eye was arrested by the sight of a small&#xD;
hole perforated in the solidmasonry at one&#xD;
side 01' the apartment. At any other time&#xD;
this might have failed to attract his atten-&#xD;
tion, but so firmly was he bent upon effect-&#xD;
lug hii escape, that this slight ~iireurn~tance&#xD;
convinced him that his first Impressions in&#xD;
regard to a secret outlet, were not without&#xD;
foundation.&#xD;
With these thoughts in his mind, be&#xD;
looked around the sp~rtment for some&#xD;
pointed instrument with which to prove the&#xD;
ralystery. In this he was successful; a few&#xD;
steps frost the spot, he discovered a some-&#xD;
what curiously shared nail, which had evi-&#xD;
dently lain within the damp cell for years, It&#xD;
heing much rusted and Injured. This he in-&#xD;
serted in tire small perforation before Sawed,&#xD;
end to his joy became aware that he was&#xD;
prsesing.against a spring. At the same&#xD;
unonrent he observed a portion of what had&#xD;
heTfore appeared the solid wall, slightly jars&#xD;
and the next It slowly turned aside, with a&#xD;
creaking noise thatecijoed through the apart-&#xD;
stunt, and revealed an entrance of near two&#xD;
(bet square. The moment tJii~t the ejiening&#xD;
was efiboted, a strong chilling breeze came&#xD;
rushing intothe ipartnstht, which ho *us at&#xD;
once convinced emanated fromasebterranean&#xD;
passage. Hope once mere swelled in the&#xD;
bosom of Captain Leonard, and th. vigor&#xD;
that characterized his every action, returned&#xD;
l~ his manly frame. He thlt once mer~is&#xD;
Indebtedness to that all-powerful Oreat~r,&#xD;
who so far through life had preserved him&#xD;
&#xD;
from r.he ruachinatlons of his itinierias e~se~&#xD;
mice. Withsuch thoughts as lhtne in hr&#xD;
mind, he retnrnedto. the fartk~rslde of the.&#xD;
cell, where a small lamp was~ staiidisg with&#xD;
whiclihe had been for~ished by the ghard,&#xD;
whose duty it was to alu~iply him with food,&#xD;
and taking It Lu his hand, strode back to&#xD;
the secret outlet. One moment more, and&#xD;
lie would have entered the ~Ioomy passage&#xD;
butwas positively prevented by the sound&#xD;
of foot-steps approaching his prison: With&#xD;
a quick movement he stepped back and drew&#xD;
the open door toward himwhich closed with&#xD;
a creaking noise, just as the door on the other&#xD;
side was thrown open to adnut theguard,&#xD;
who supplied him with food and w~t~r. As-&#xD;
suming an air of composure that he ~did pot&#xD;
by any means feel, Captain Leonard; turned&#xD;
to the man who was evidently much sur-&#xD;
prleed at the appearance Qf the prisoner with&#xD;
his lamp in his hand.&#xD;
"Captain Leonard is astir Jate," remarked&#xD;
the guard eyeing th~ prisoner closely.&#xD;
~ Why yes," replied hatterr In a car~el~s&#xD;
tone, which he could JQ'WQll ee~ume. "I)nr~r$&#xD;

&#xD;
willingly place themselves in contact with&#xD;
the dreaded scourgee of the Rio Grand." In&#xD;
this state of mind he mused over the many&#xD;
prominent events of his past life. Lieute-&#xD;
nant Ricardo was born near the city of Val-.&#xD;
ladolid on the river Dour~, His parents&#xD;
were not wealthy, but in respectable circum~&#xD;
stances. They lived by the management and&#xD;
culture of the grape. At an early age&#xD;
Lieutenant Bicardo had expressed a desire to&#xD;
enter the ranks oi the army, and as his father&#xD;
had been in his younger days a soldier in the&#xD;
service et his country, his inclinations were&#xD;
not opposed. Accordingly the youuget&#xD;
Ricardo entered the service in, the private&#xD;
ranks. In the course of time, he was promo-&#xD;
tedand upon hissubsequentarrival inMexico&#xD;
received the Commission of, Lieutenant from&#xD;
8auta Anna, by embracing the cause of that&#xD;
ostensible noblemen. Of his quarrel and&#xD;
~nco~nter with the now-bandit chieftain&#xD;
before quitting Spain, the reader has already&#xD;
been informed in the wordp of Cawile himself,&#xD;
when explaining his motives to his prisoners,&#xD;
so nothing further uced be paid in order to&#xD;
introduce things, in their proper light.&#xD;
Lieutenant Ricardo was now convinced that&#xD;
by some means the commander-in-chief had&#xD;
been induced to betray him into the power of&#xD;
of his old enewy, and he partly accounted for&#xD;
it in the following manner. At the present&#xD;
stage of the struggle between ~the United&#xD;
l~tates and Mexico it was well known that&#xD;
'the forces of the latter were some-what di.&#xD;
mished by the recent disasters at Palo Alto&#xD;
and Resaca de la Palms, for the great force&#xD;
that was afterwards concentrated at Buena&#xD;
&#xD;
'much on the assistance of Clamile, in carrying&#xD;
forward the 'assassin..like warfare which he&#xD;
was then waging against his more open and&#xD;
generous enemy. From these circumstances&#xD;
Lieutenant Ricardo was induced to believe&#xD;
that Santa Anna, in order to retain the aid&#xD;
and good-will of the formidable ranchero.&#xD;
had betrayed him into the hands of his mast&#xD;
deadly enemy. The hours passed over, but&#xD;
the Lieutenant knew not whether day or&#xD;
night reigned over the world without,, for it&#xD;
brought no visible changewithin his prison-.--&#xD;
all was damp and gIoowy~. Feeling wearied,&#xD;

Meanwhile many changes had taken place.&#xD;
Aiphouso and Olinda had daily advanced in&#xD;
love, and Captain Peron would not have&#xD;
been indifferent to this growing attachment,&#xD;
if his thoughts bad not been otherwise ezn.-&#xD;

From Victoria he returned immediately on&#xD;
having discharged his duty, and since he&#xD;
came back had done but little else than&#xD;
make love to Andronita.&#xD;
As to Captain Leonard he had inquired of&#xD;
Olirida, who the maiden was that commis-'&#xD;

of his.exhibition~ but Olinda did not know.&#xD;
He asked Mrs. Romano, and she did not&#xD;
know.&#xD;
"Do you know a maiden whose. name is&#xD;
Rapello ?" inquired the Captain, surprised&#xD;
to think no one had witnessed the tears that&#xD;
controlled his destiny.&#xD;
Captain Leonard did not know that his&#xD;
sympathiser and deliverer were identical; 'he&#xD;
felt thatthey must beand that was all. One&#xD;
he had seen, and her tears; the other be had&#xD;
heard, and by herr assistance had gained his&#xD;
liberty, and eventually saved his life. Ba-&#xD;
pello was the name of his delivere"r; she de-&#xD;
served his thanks; and then ~he might be the&#xD;
object of his search.&#xD;
"Yes," replied Olinda. "Mr. Ambrosia's&#xD;
niece is so named---Andronita Rapello; but&#xD;
surely it is not alma you mean ?"&#xD;
"It may 'be," said Mrs. Romano, "she&#xD;
was at my house the day the monster was&#xD;
shown," This was said playfully and was&#xD;
accompanied with.a smile.&#xD;
"It cannot be," said Olinda. "She is&#xD;
but a child; I mean in years, for she is a&#xD;
sage in thought. I love her dearly, for she&#xD;
Is a true woman. And she' is kind, but not&#xD;
tender; I never saw her weep, if she could,&#xD;
the would not at such a moment."&#xD;
"The girl I mean is tall, straight, slender,&#xD;
pliant, and extremely youthful," said Capt.&#xD;
&#xD;
Leonard. "U ~r hnir hangs about her neck&#xD;

is exceedingly handsome, and htr Ibatures&#xD;

soft in their expression, like the gazelle's,&#xD;
which they strongly resemble' in size and&#xD;
lustre. Do I describe Audronita?"&#xD;
"Yes, and perfectly," answered' Olinda.&#xD;
"But I am astonished she never wept before'&#xD;
-tears, I mean. Whatever her heart may&#xD;
have suffered in contemplating' human&#xD;
misery, never did it manifest itself in this&#xD;
wise She is a strange compound-soft and&#xD;

mau Understand me rightly, it is her na-&#xD;
ture to be the woman in all things; yet, if&#xD;
occasion require, she can act a manly part,&#xD;
if that part is heroic."&#xD;
"I know another after this sort," said&#xD;
Captain Leonard. He would have added&#xD;
something more, if he had not been inter-&#xD;
rupted.&#xD;
"She may be of this sort," said Olinda,&#xD;
quietly. understanding whomhe meant, "but&#xD;
a very feeble type of the character, which&#xD;
Andronita so completely represents."&#xD;
"Do you know Miss Rodamont, that I&#xD;
greatly admire what I have seen of this&#xD;
young lady ?" inquired the American.&#xD;
"She would be dull indeed who did not&#xD;
suspect as much from your conversation,"&#xD;
replied Olinda.        /&#xD;
Do you know that I have reason to be&#xD;
grateful to this fair creature for a manifesta-&#xD;
tion in my favor of that heroic manliness&#xD;
which you say constitutes the under current&#xD;
of her character V' continued Captain Leon.&#xD;
ard.&#xD;
"Ido not," replied Olinda.&#xD;
"Then she has not told-you ?" asked- the&#xD;
Captain, surprised.'&#xD;
"She has told me nothing," answered&#xD;
Olinda. "What was there to tell ?"&#xD;
Did it never occur to your mind to inquire&#xD;
how'the thongs of the prisoner come to be&#xD;

Amerjcan.&#xD;
"Yes, and often too, t~en'and since," re-&#xD;

why Andronita was so composed in the&#xD;

distraction."&#xD;
"Is she so very young as she appears?'&#xD;
inquired the Captain;&#xD;
"She is but eighteen," replied Olinda&#xD;
"Eighteen 1" repeated the American.&#xD;
A pause ensued Captain Leonard re-&#xD;
flected. Olinda~and the widow observed his&#xD;
thoughtfulness; they glanced at each other,&#xD;
but neither spoke. The pause was brief,&#xD;
and was broken by the Captain, who talked&#xD;
to himself. abstractedly.&#xD;
"Eighteen I" he repeated. "There is a&#xD;
great discrepancy; is it 00 much ?"&#xD;
The Captain, it wil be observed, by the&#xD;
reader, wa~ compa ing the maiden's age&#xD;
with his own; hut Olinda understood the&#xD;
language as applying wholly to Andronita.&#xD;
"You think, then," said she, "that her&#xD;
appearance is younger than herself?"&#xD;
"I think," said the Captain, blushing, as&#xD;
he recollected his language, "that there is a&#xD;
slight discrepancy; she looks to be no more&#xD;
than sixteen."&#xD;
"It is her flexible form and transparent&#xD;
complexion that gives her so youthful an&#xD;
appearance," said Olinda. "She is more&#xD;
the woman than she seems."&#xD;
"Eighteen!" repeated the captain. "In&#xD;
that many years women mostly pass through&#xD;
'~bree distinct phases of existence-the days&#xD;
of infancy, the days of instruction, and the&#xD;
days of flirtation. What is Andronita's&#xD;
history ?"&#xD;
"In the first period she lost her parents,&#xD;
and found a home with the kind-hearted Am-&#xD;
brosia, the second period was spent in San&#xD;
Louis Fotosi, and has just concluded; the&#xD;
third, therefore, has not yet elapsed, and&#xD;
I think I may promise Captain Leonard a&#xD;
share in the' pleasures-" It was thus Olinda&#xD;
answered.&#xD;
At the moment, Captain Leonard gave&#xD;
her concluding words but little attention;&#xD;
afterward, however, then he recalled them,&#xD;
and the look by which they were accompa.'&#xD;
nied, they seemed to have a significance&#xD;
which he had entirely overlooked. But&#xD;
&#xD;
what t~iey could mean he could not well cot&#xD;
jecture.&#xD;
With this subject uppermost in his mind,&#xD;
he set out that afternoon for the residence os&#xD;
Andronita. The Alcalde lived on the Texas&#xD;
side of the Rio Grande, about five miles&#xD;
from Matamoras- He owned a large tract&#xD;
of land, upon which lived some four-score&#xD;
families, whose rude dwellings were clustered&#xD;
together under the name of San Augustine.&#xD;
His own house was a large adobe builPing,&#xD;
fronting toward the north; the roof covered&#xD;
*ith fiat tiles, forming a promenade, and&#xD;
protected by a ballustrade the height of a&#xD;
woman elbow. Behind the house was a&#xD;
spacious garden, surrounded by a wall of&#xD;
brick, and full of tropical trees--orange,&#xD;
lemon, lime, fig, citroh, tamarind, palm, and&#xD;
pommegr&amp;amp;nate.&#xD;
At San Augustine Captain Leonard had&#xD;
a warm reception. Ambrosia, though not&#xD;
a great, was a good man. He was glad to&#xD;
see the American; he said so, and a goon&#xD;
man utters no falsehood. His manner was&#xD;
kind and demonstrative, and his language&#xD;
flattering. The Captain was accustomed to&#xD;
compliments, and could return them; and on&#xD;
this occasion he did, mingled with repeated&#xD;
thanks. They discussed, in a very friendly&#xD;
manner, all the little incidents, pleasant and&#xD;
unpleasant, which had transpired since the&#xD;
Flying Cloud put into the Rio Grande for&#xD;
shelter from the storm.&#xD;
An allusion to this circumstance induced&#xD;
the Captain to inquire the fate of his vessel,&#xD;
which had been confiscated. This fact he&#xD;
knew, and had known for weeks; but he&#xD;
also knew that the schooner, unless by pur-&#xD;
pose or accident destroyed, was somewhere&#xD;
in the waters of Mexico. Ambrosia had&#xD;
the required information, and he gratified&#xD;
the inquirer. The Flying Cloud was .~&#xD;
Alvorado.&#xD;
After this conversaIi~~ Ambrosia pro.&#xD;
posed a walk, and he and ~ gnest strolled&#xD;
out into the village, to look at the people&#xD;
and their dwellings. Captain Leonard felt&#xD;
but little interest in either; nevertheless he&#xD;
listened patiently to all that Ambrosia had&#xD;
to say respecting them. It is written pa.&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
THE RANGER'S REVENGE.&#xD;
&#xD;
gently, and patiently it wits so far as appear-&#xD;
inces was concerned, but patiently it was&#xD;
iot in reality. Captain Leonard, though&#xD;
,is manner evinced anything else, was ex-&#xD;
sedingly anxious to return.&#xD;
At length the round was accomplished.&#xD;
rlreir steps were about to be retraced; they&#xD;
Lad turned their face toward the mansion,&#xD;
in the top of which Captain Le9nard dis-&#xD;
inctly saw two persons, the one a man,. aud&#xD;
lie other a woman. He was too far off to&#xD;
lietinguish, but he felt that one was A.ndro-&#xD;
ita, Bud the other a suitor. The tonight&#xD;
sade him miserable. Re began inwardly to&#xD;
Leplore his fate; he regretted that he had&#xD;
eft Matamoras, for there he could have&#xD;
honked Ambrosia, as well as at his own&#xD;
Louse. But this was not the object of his&#xD;
isit, though he intimated as much to the&#xD;
~Icalde, and tried to deceive his own mind&#xD;
etothe same belief.&#xD;
Before they had proceeded many steps,&#xD;
he twain upon the house-top descended out&#xD;
f eight, and who the gentleman was, he was&#xD;
eft to conjecture. On their return to the&#xD;
ouse, Ambrosia conducted his guest to the&#xD;
ining-room, where tea was prepared. Mrs.&#xD;
~inbrosia, a very agreeable, lady-like, ma..&#xD;
ronly woman of fifty, having in this respect&#xD;
sine ten years the advantage of her good,&#xD;
husband, (whose hair was quite gray with&#xD;
he frosts of sixty,) was the hostess on this&#xD;
cession.&#xD;
The conversation turned upon books and;&#xD;
authors, and those of Spanish origin were&#xD;
chiefly discussed. The Captain was fami-&#xD;
ar with many such, 'and the conversation&#xD;
us agreeable. Still he could not but think&#xD;

After supperVAmbrosia proposed a walk&#xD;
his garden. But scarcely had they got&#xD;
every beyond the door, when the Alcalde's&#xD;
presence was required at the front of the&#xD;
suse. He excused himself, told the Captain&#xD;
follow the main walk, and promising to&#xD;
6&#xD;
&#xD;
join him presently, hastened away to obey&#xD;
the summons-&#xD;
Captain Leonard followed the directions&#xD;
until he reached the termination of the walk,&#xD;
where he waited some minutes for his cora.&#xD;
panion and guide. But growing weary, he&#xD;
turned out into a narrow side path, which&#xD;
wound away to another and more distant&#xD;
portion of the garden. As he walked along,&#xD;
musing, he heard human voices close-at hand&#xD;
and directly in front of him. The speakers&#xD;
were concealed from view, but he inst~antly&#xD;
recognized the voices of Andronita and Capt.&#xD;
Peron.&#xD;
"In that you are greatly mistaken," said&#xD;
the latter.&#xD;
"I do not irnow that I am," replied the&#xD;
former.&#xD;
"I have not forsaken Olinda." said the&#xD;
officer.&#xD;
"Then why are you not with her ?" in.&#xD;
quired the, maiden.&#xD;
"She has forsaken me," returned Peron.&#xD;
"And you came hither because forsaken?"&#xD;
said Andronita, disdainfully.&#xD;
"There is nothing on earth so dear that I&#xD;
would not forsake for your sake," said the&#xD;
officer; "but I have been obliged to forsake&#xD;
not and therefore guiltless of the supw&#xD;
posed perfidy."&#xD;
"Guiltless inact, certainly; but not guilt,.&#xD;
less in thought and will to do the deed had&#xD;
it been necessary, if what you\say is true"&#xD;
rejoined Andronita.&#xD;
"Incorrigible creature! why will you thus&#xD;
willfully pervert everything I ntter ?" cried&#xD;
Peron, with impatience and-vexation.&#xD;
"Because I do not believe the half," an~.&#xD;
swerved the maiden, frankly but severely.&#xD;
"But you must believe," returned the&#xD;
officer, with a strong accent upon the aux~&#xD;
iliary.&#xD;
"How can I 7" demanded Andronit.&#xD;
quickly. "You are betrothed to Olinda.&#xD;
and the engagement Is not broken, nor do&#xD;

who could prefer another to Olinda&#xD;

"Andronita," said the officer, with in-&#xD;
ereased firmness, "I have now let you go on,&#xD;
until lam wearied."&#xD;
"I am heartily glad of It," answered the&#xD;
maiden quickly; "perhaps I shall have less&#xD;
trouble In future."&#xD;
"I say I am wearied," repeated the officer&#xD;
impatiently. "You must decide this mat-&#xD;
terliere and at once."&#xD;
"Captain Peron," replied the maiden,&#xD;
earnestly, "on two other occasions~l have&#xD;
bid you as plainly as language could tell,&#xD;
that I would never be your wife; and you&#xD;
persist to no purpose. This I have also told&#xD;
my uncle, who favors your suit, in spite of&#xD;
your engagement with Oliuda; the Only&#xD;
thing I ever knew him to do that did not&#xD;
meet the world's approbation. He once&#xD;
hinted at services rendered him by your&#xD;

demeanor toward yourself and me en nO&#xD;

much they may have~ heriefitted my uncle, is&#xD;
no reason why the niece of the latter should&#xD;

from every other consideration."'&#xD;
"And do you adhere to this determine.&#xD;

voice?' "Reflect before you answer."&#xD;
"If I could have had my way, I had been&#xD;

mE MEXICAN BRIDII; OR,&#xD;
&#xD;
In this camp, as might be supposed, there&#xD;
was very little discipline. In truth, Peron&#xD;
hims~if was seldom there. Most of his time&#xD;
was spent at Saint Augustine and Matamo-&#xD;
ras, thenglz n theli~tter place he always wore&#xD;
a disguise. Of course he was known to&#xD;
his acquaintances, but by the Americans,&#xD;
could hot be distinguished from any other&#xD;
stranger of the republic.&#xD;
It was In his camp where he planned the&#xD;
abduction of Andronita. And every neces-&#xD;
sarything was so completely arranged, that&#xD;
he must have succeeded but for the timely&#xD;
Interferenceof Captain Leonard.&#xD;
But he was not a man to be thwarted with&#xD;
Impunity. He was of a determined mind, and&#xD;
of a vengeful disposition. He loved adven-&#xD;
ture, and always preferred the post of&#xD;
danger.&#xD;
His misadventure in Ambrosia's garden,&#xD;
Ired him with revenge. He returned with&#xD;
his men to their camp, and there concocted&#xD;
another plan to secure the forcible posses-&#xD;
sion of the damsel, as well as one for the des-&#xD;
truction of her deliverer.&#xD;
Both failed, however; and the latter re-&#xD;
~ulted talus recognition, and well nigh in his&#xD;
arrest. The assassination was atte1n~ted in&#xD;
a billiard-room, kept by Angelo Oliva, an&#xD;
Italian, by whom it was happily prevented.&#xD;
It ~as after night, and the assassin, by&#xD;
means of the darkness, effected his escape.&#xD;
One of his men, however, was caught and&#xD;
sent to the ~Mexican prison; but he was die.&#xD;
charged in the course of a few days, no one&#xD;
appearing to prosecute.&#xD;
The second attempt to' kidnap Andronita,&#xD;
also' failing, Peron grew more deterrnine4,&#xD;
and resolved to storm the Inansion. But&#xD;
Ambrosia fearing such an event, obtained&#xD;
permission from the cousnaridant of the post&#xD;
atMatamoras, to arm a certain nuniber o~&#xD;
his ~anc1rero~ for the defense of his flimily.&#xD;
Ne~ of this preparation having reached&#xD;
Peron, he concludedthat It would be unsafe&#xD;
to niake the contemplated attack, sod it was&#xD;
thei~efore abandoned. But other means were&#xD;
Iwhediately adopted toaccomplish the same&#xD;
ptitpOs~.&#xD;
Meanwhile time elapsed, and other events&#xD;
&#xD;
transpired. Captain Leonard had becoaw&#xD;
a frequent and welcome visitor at the house&#xD;
of the alcalde, and the accepted lover of his&#xD;
beautiful niece, with the approval of her&#xD;
friends.&#xD;
More than this. A day was fixed for their&#xD;
nuptials, and a messenger had heen dis.&#xD;
patched to Victoria for a bishop, who waste&#xD;
perform the ceremony;, and this high digni-&#xD;
tary was daily expected.&#xD;
Among the first informed of these things,&#xD;
was Olinda Bodamont, who visited Saint&#xD;
Augustine at the request of, Andronita, to&#xD;
remain with her until after the nuptial ce-&#xD;
remony.&#xD;
During the interval she received a parti-.&#xD;
cular account of Captain PeronYs behavior&#xD;
toward his niece, which afforded her an&#xD;
additional proof of his gross perfidy toward&#xD;
herself.&#xD;
Olinda was not an angel, and much as she&#xD;
loved Andronita, she could not forgive the&#xD;
officer the preference manifested for her friend&#xD;
although she herself loved another.&#xD;
Almost daily Captain Leonard rode over&#xD;
te the mansion of the al~alde, and Alphonse&#xD;
not infrequently bore him company. On&#xD;
one occasion the following conversation&#xD;
transpired.&#xD;
"Has anything been heard of Captain Pe-&#xD;
ron ?" inquired Alphonso.&#xD;
"Nothing reliable," answered the Ameri-&#xD;
can. "A company of traders, from New&#xD;
Leon. reported to have seen him at Riconada&#xD;

account."&#xD;
"And I should unless I knew the narrt~tor&#xD;

"He is a merchant, from Cadareyta, highly&#xD;

replied Captain Leonard. "But all these&#xD;

Coaster, who was slowly recovering from his&#xD;
wounded, proceeded in a single body; while&#xD;
the Americans, including Mr. Shatsellfob-&#xD;

whole number was not much short of a hun-&#xD;
dred persons, three-fourths of whom wete&#xD;

Springfield swords.&#xD;
All these things were duly reported to&#xD;
Peron, who, with his ~ozumnnd, was waiting&#xD;
behind the brake for Information' which&#xD;
should confirm or change his plan. He' lie-&#xD;
tened patiently to the detail of facts, and at&#xD;
the conclusion expressed his determinatIon t~e&#xD;

one likely to succeed.&#xD;
He argued thus of course the principal&#xD;

About the middle of the afternoon thesig-&#xD;

keteers were all mounted, marshalled, and&#xD;
marched. They approached the mansion in&#xD;

The bride tripped forth in all her maiden&#xD;
loveliness; decorated in the most becoming&#xD;
manlier, atid was elevated to a seat on a&#xD;

Simultaneous with her egress, Peron,&#xD;
closely followed by his, fiendish men, darted&#xD;

savageyell that would have shamed the law.&#xD;

herself into her husband's arms,. which were&#xD;
ertende4 to receive her. Butthe approach&#xD;
of Peron was so rapid, that she was unable&#xD;
to accomplish her design; for just as she ~as&#xD;
about to quit the saddle, his muffianly arm&#xD;
encircled her waist and snatched her from&#xD;
the protecting embrace of her brave and gal&#xD;
lant spouse. He came and went like the&#xD;

him to overtake the rear of the flying parzy&#xD;
whom he would have passed in his eager pur'&#xD;
suit, bat that the villain guided his owr&#xD;
horse athwart his path and impeded his pro&#xD;
gross. Angered beyond measure or control,&#xD;
the pursuer snatched from his bosom the re.&#xD;
volver which he had used with good effect on&#xD;
other occasions, and the next moment the&#xD;
musketeer rolled In the dust. A second, a&#xD;
third, and a fourth, who endeavored to retard&#xD;
his progress, mot.a similar fate, and the rest,&#xD;
seized with a sudden panic, fled in every di-&#xD;
rection ;~ while the officers who were close&#xD;
behind, pursued them in their devious course&#xD;
and cut them down without mercy in their&#xD;
headlong flight.&#xD;
Still Peron, far In the advance, spurred&#xD;
his horse to his utmost speed, and kept on&#xD;
In thosame direction. Leaving the dispersed&#xD;
musketeers to be followed by. the American&#xD;
officers, Captain Leonard pursued their dar-&#xD;
ing leader, between whom and himself the&#xD;
distance was every moment diminishing.&#xD;
At length he was within pistol range; but&#xD;
the ruffian, observing the lerelled weapon,&#xD;
quickly interposed his unconscious burden,&#xD;
and saved himself from the death he so richly&#xD;
merited.&#xD;
Afraid to fire, lest in his effort to kill Pc-&#xD;
ron he might destroy his wife, Captain Leon-&#xD;
ard thrust the pistol back into his bosom,&#xD;
struck his spurs deep into the sides of his&#xD;
horse, and exerted every nerve to overtake&#xD;
the fugitive. But the attempt was useless,&#xD;
for his own beast, though swifter than the&#xD;
Other for a certain distance, was not capable&#xD;
of as much ~fatigue and endurance; and the&#xD;
space between them, which until now had&#xD;
gradually diminished, began to increase with&#xD;
fearful rapidity.&#xD;
[n this extremity, Captain leonard again&#xD;
plucked the pistol from his bosom, and le-&#xD;
veiled it at the fugitive; but the drooping&#xD;
body of his wife, again thrust between the&#xD;
wI~im ano his danger, paralyzed the finger&#xD;
&#xD;
that pressed the trigger, and the weapon an~&amp;amp;&#xD;
hand fell heavily by his side together. Bnt&#xD;
the next moment both were again raised, and&#xD;
the contents of another barrel discharged~&#xD;
but not at the politic villain, who was armed&#xD;
with a shield more effectual than brass or&#xD;
iron; but at his tireless steed, which received&#xD;
the load in its head, and reared and plunged,&#xD;
and at length fell down in the agonies of.&#xD;
death.&#xD;
In the fall, Andronita and Peron became&#xD;
separated. The former, who had fainted, as&#xD;
soon as she found herself in the arnie of her&#xD;
rejected lover, lay on the ground senseless&#xD;
~ short distance from the dying beast. But&#xD;
Peron quickly regaining his feet, drew his&#xD;
sword and rushed upon Captain Leonard,&#xD;
who had leaped from his horse to protecthis&#xD;
bride. The American still held in his hand&#xD;
the pistol from which he had already five&#xD;
times discharged a messenger of death: and&#xD;
it yet contained another, which the next mo-&#xD;
mont, was deeply lodged in the breast of his&#xD;
lawless rival.&#xD;
In a little time, several of the officers ar-&#xD;
rived, and afforded their triumphant country.&#xD;
man such assistance as the emergency re-&#xD;
quired. Andronita was conveyed to her&#xD;
uncle's mansion and by the help of suitable&#xD;
medicaments, was in a little while restored to&#xD;
consciousness. But in consequence of this&#xD;
interruption, and the many deaths it had&#xD;
occasioned, thirteen of the musketeers having&#xD;
shared the fate of their commander, the wed.&#xD;
ding ball, which was to have come off that&#xD;
night at the splendid mansion of Velasques&#xD;
Rornanno, was deferred until the following.&#xD;
After the departure of the guests, most of&#xD;
whom returned to the city that evenIng~ the&#xD;
rancheros wore dispatched to collect and&#xD;
bury the dead bodies of Peron and his ill~~&#xD;
fated followers, and to administer to the re-&#xD;
lief of the wounded, who were unable to ce-&#xD;
cape, of whom the number embraced nearly&#xD;
one third of the company.&#xD;
