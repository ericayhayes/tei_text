Very few novels have y~.t been written which combine more perfectly            )&#xD;
than this does the exciting interest of a Sea Romance with the more&#xD;
quiet and heart-touching incidents of Domestic Life. Althou~Ih&#xD;
the Author prefers for the present to withhold his name from the pub-&#xD;
lie he is destined, we venture to say, to take a high position among&#xD;
the Romance writers of the present day. Many of the Sea Scenes&#xD;
will remind the critical reader of some of Cooper's best productions,&#xD;
while other portions-those of a pathetic nature-are scarcely exceeded&#xD;
by Dickens huinseif. CONTENTS;&#xD;

JACK WAID, TH~ BURGLAR,&#xD;

Intelligent readers uf the present day cannot have failed to observe, the sameness and&#xD;
uniformity Qf'Ta9d~Tn ~ctinns, and they wili l~e refresh9dby meeting with a work entirely&#xD;
orl~inal, which this i.. We all remember the shuddering sensations with which we turned&#xD;
the pages of "The Three Spaniqrds" in ,ur .youthful days; how we were led on from&#xD;
mystery to mystery, until our very souls were absorbed in terror; how crime and dark in-&#xD;
trigues were interwuveu through the whole plot; how gloomy forests and old castles lent&#xD;
ap~slling interest to late~sity of description, and t~se entire story impressed itself upon our&#xD;
imagination~ so thoromighly, that we were actors as it were in the drama ourselves. Such&#xD;
power and vividness hate we in the present work! No one who peruses "Jack Waid, or&#xD;
The Cobbler of Gotham," wiU rise from it with anything but thrilling sensations, nor will&#xD;
the story ever be effaced frtm his memory, but live on with him through after years, and be&#xD;
a fact, so to speak, iu his existence. Some idea of the characters, and the plot 'f the story,&#xD;

CHAPTER I.&#xD;
T~n SERPENT 1?J TH~ Gaiss.&#xD;
It was in the year 18-, and the scene in&#xD;
a lower apartment of a fine old mansion that&#xD;
stood on a gentle knoll that overlooked the&#xD;
clear sparkling waters of the Schuylkill&#xD;
river.&#xD;
The room was superbly furnished in accor*&#xD;
dance with the fashion of the time, which,&#xD;
if it yielded to the sumpt~iousness of modern&#xD;
luxury, made amends in i(s substantial and&#xD;
massive richness.&#xD;
&#xD;
On an embroidered couch, beneath the&#xD;
rich hangings of the window, thrq~igh which&#xD;
stole the soft Eephyrs of a summer evening,&#xD;
a young and lovely womaa reclined. Her&#xD;
dress was simple, but costly, and was s~dmi.&#xD;
rably adapted to heighten, if that indeed&#xD;
were possible, the matchless graces and&#xD;
symmetry of her figure. Her features were&#xD;
exquisitely chiselled, though it was plain to&#xD;
be seen, that years had not yet matured her&#xD;
singular beauty.&#xD;
The attitude of the fair girl-for though.&#xD;
wedded she seemed no more-was one of&#xD;
thoughtfulness arid dejection. Tears stoo4&#xD;
in her large blue eyes, but ere the jewelled&#xD;
drops fell from her fringi~~lids, she wiped&#xD;
them away, andlooking out upon the garden,&#xD;
&#xD;
9&#xD;
&#xD;
O&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC8196-00000005"/>&#xD;
8                       THE BLU:&#xD;
the fresh balmy air toyed with her silken&#xD;
locks and fanned her lily-like forehead.&#xD;
Presently the door suddenly opened,&#xD;
and ere the lady had time to rise fr im her&#xD;
recumbent position on the couch, a nobles&#xD;
lo~dng young man enteredd and cast his eyes&#xD;
around the apartment.&#xD;
Quickly perceiving that he had intruded&#xD;
upon the privacy of a lady's boudoir, he&#xD;
drew back, and with a profound obeisance re-&#xD;
marked&#xD;
"I crave your pardon, madam, for having&#xD;
ventured here unannounced. I was inform-&#xD;
ed, by the servant, that I should fln'd Mr.&#xD;
Walsingham within."&#xD;
"He is not here, Mr. Thornton; but,&#xD;
doubtless, is in the library, the room adjoin-&#xD;
ing on tha right."&#xD;
"Thank you, madam," replied the. young&#xD;
gentleman, and, he retreated backward&#xD;
from the room.&#xD;
Scarcely had he done soA and closed the&#xD;
door after him, when a side panel was with-&#xD;
drawn, and an elderly man, of athletic per-&#xD;
s6a and strongly marked features, entered the&#xD;
room. It was Harvey Walsiugham, the&#xD;
older of the three brothers of the veteran&#xD;
merchants of that name. He was no~ the&#xD;
sole successor in the business of his father,&#xD;
whose extreme, old age had induced him,&#xD;
several years previous, to retire from the&#xD;
active scenes of commercial life. The junior&#xD;
Walsiugham was himself now in his fiftieth&#xD;
year, and hnd remained a bachelor until only&#xD;
a few month~f the time of wlmich we now&#xD;
write.&#xD;
flis step 'was haughty; his countenance&#xD;
wore an habitual expression of sternuess ; his&#xD;
movements abrupt; his voice harsh; but in&#xD;
his general aspect there was a certain dignity&#xD;
inseparable from the habit of commanding;&#xD;
and a courtesy not devoid of grace, that when&#xD;
he choose, could secure affection as well as&#xD;
respect. When the iron will and the majesty&#xD;
of physical strength can bow to the loveli-&#xD;
ness of woman-the enchantress is usually&#xD;
more proud of her conquest than when she&#xD;
&#xD;
E BEARDS&#xD;
has subdued only intellectual power. It was&#xD;
with this pride that Mary Walton loved&#xD;
Harvey Walsiugham, and accepted him as&#xD;
her husband and friend.&#xD;
"Who left here, but now, Mary 7" inquired&#xD;
the husband somewhat abruptly. "I thought&#xD;
I heard some one speak, and the tread of&#xD;
steps, as I entered."&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Thornton was here in search&#xD;
of you," replied the young wife.&#xD;
"ThorntQn I" repeated Wal,~ingham, bend.&#xD;
ing his keen eyes on his wife, who looked up&#xD;
into his face with loving confidence. He&#xD;
added quickly: "You h~ive been weeping,&#xD;
Mary! Has Augustus Thornton, my account-&#xD;
taut, seen the wife of his employer in tears."&#xD;
"Nay, Walsinghani," said the young wife&#xD;
softly, casting down her eyes. "I was think-&#xD;
ing of my dear mother and my earliest home,&#xD;
and I could not but give vent to my feelings&#xD;
at the moment you entered, my husband."&#xD;
"Always pining afterhome," muttered the&#xD;
iron man, impatiently, "Can not my love&#xD;
and wealth supply the place of your parents&#xD;
and their humble home? Really, I begin to&#xD;
weary of this childish fretfulness and per-&#xD;
verseness, Mary, I would have you under-&#xD;
stand."&#xD;
"Be not offended with me, my dear hus-&#xD;
band," whispered his beautiful spouse, throw-&#xD;
ing her fair arms around his neck, and lean-&#xD;
ing her head or his breast. "Be not angry&#xD;
with me. It is but iiatural that I should&#xD;
grieve when I rernenher the scenes of child-&#xD;
hood and the fond crossings of my loving&#xD;
and beloved parents.~~&#xD;
"Mary," said the merchant, sternly, though&#xD;
h~ pcrmittted and returned the caresses of&#xD;
his wife, "Mary, deem me not selfish or cx.&#xD;

omit feelings are incongenial and thai my&#xD;
deep absorbing love for you has from first to&#xD;
to last, been but cold and indifferentlyre-&#xD;

"You are cruel to doubt my love for you,&#xD;
Walsingiiam. You have all my affection,&#xD;
save that which the instincts of my nature will&#xD;
have me reserve for the loved ones who gave&#xD;
me life and being.~~&#xD;
"Nay, Mary, I did not doubt your love for&#xD;
me to the full extent your naturally' cold&#xD;
temperament will allow. But it is not the&#xD;
kind of sympathy and love I Something&#xD;
more ardent and burning, would more befit&#xD;
the impassioned impulses of my bosom.-&#xD;
But, after all, Mary, you are not to blame.&#xD;
Mine is a wayward heart, and it will need&#xD;
all your tenderness and the best strength of&#xD;
my own philosophy to bring pence and hap-&#xD;
piness to my soul."&#xD;
Theconversation between the husband and&#xD;
wife, was interrupted by a servant knocking&#xD;
at the door, and bringing a letter to the man-&#xD;
tsr. It seemed to be on matters~of weighty&#xD;
mo~ment. His brow became flushed, and then&#xD;
pale, as he read its contents. Mary watched&#xD;
his countenance with eager anxiety. Die-&#xD;
missing the man who brought the letter, by&#xD;
a sign, Walsiaghani turned to his wife.&#xD;
"It is even worse than I thought, Mary-&#xD;
Nothing but disaster on disaster. Another&#xD;
ship lost, with her rich cargo, from Lyons.-&#xD;
A few more such losses and I shall be ruined&#xD;
for ever. I am called to New York, with a&#xD;
view of a settlement of salvage, and ~nust&#xD;

at nine. Ah, again in tears I But cheer up,&#xD;
Mary-your tears only serve to forbocle fur-&#xD;

Walsingham sought the apartment of his&#xD;

for some considerable time.&#xD;

afew weeks to the Walsiugham mansion, they&#xD;
both descended to the garden, andsocui steod&#xD;
before a natural arbor, formed by interlacing&#xD;
boughs, over which crept many vin~e laden&#xD;
with golden and crimson flowers,&#xD;
A picture which there presented ttsel4 e~r-&#xD;
rested the attention of Mary. She touched&#xD;
the arm of her cousin, i~nd they approached&#xD;
softly nearer.&#xD;
A boy of twelve years of age, of uncom-&#xD;
mon beautywas seatedon the ground, writ-&#xD;
ing in a small portfolio or album.&#xD;
His face was fair as that of a girl's, but&#xD;
shaded now by the long clustering golden&#xD;
locks, which floated in rich profession about&#xD;
his brow and over his shoulders. As, at in-&#xD;
tervals, in the ecstasy of his eom~osition,&#xD;
he raised his dark flashing eyes upwards,&#xD;
with a wrapt expression. on his suuw-whitQ&#xD;
brow, he might have formed the sculptor's&#xD;
model for the young Genius of Poetry.&#xD;
Mary Walsingha~i gazed admiringly a few&#xD;
moments upon her young nephew, for such&#xD;
he was, the only son of her husband's bro-&#xD;
ther Louis, and now an orphan, beneath the&#xD;
roof of his grandfather and uncle Harvey.-&#xD;
Approaching him unperceived, Mary laid her&#xD;
han~ on his head, and in a voice of playful&#xD;
sweetness, said&#xD;
"Ah, invoking the Muses, I perceive, my&#xD;
nephew Conradin?"&#xD;
The boy started up, let fall his pencil and&#xD;
blushed deeply, but recovering instantly&#xD;
from his embarrassment, he answered:-&#xD;
"Yes, dear Aunt, I was trying to write a&#xD;
little ode to Spring, butthough I know I have&#xD;
poetry within me, I cannot now utter what I&#xD;
"Time will give you suitable language for&#xD;
your thoughts," said his Aunt, smiling and&#xD;
aftectionately caressing him. You are yet too&#xD;
young, my ~Jonradin, to trouble your brain&#xD;
with attempts at poetry."&#xD;
"Oh, no, dear Aunt. You know lam now&#xD;
more than twelve years oldand that is not&#xD;
too young to be a poet, I should think. See,&#xD;

"Yes; he is growing just 'like his poor&#xD;

Mary read torah of the verses, and praising&#xD;
the genius of her young relative, gave the&#xD;
manuteript volume to Ida, and returned to&#xD;
the house to await the parting interview with&#xD;
her husband.&#xD;
Ida penetrated deeperinto the embowering&#xD;
shades, and presently reached a spot where&#xD;
a white marble fouatain gleamed amid the&#xD;
emerald foliage, and shot up a crystal column&#xD;
t1~water, Which fell again in refreshing sprays&#xD;
on the shrubbery around. Here she flung&#xD;
herself okra rustic seat, covered her face With&#xD;
her hands, and became absorved in a reverie&#xD;

At length ahestrove to calm her agitatiQn&#xD;
and wiped away Some tear-drops that had ga.&#xD;

Preaentlya footstep Was heas-d, in the walk&#xD;
among the' trees. She started up, suddenly,&#xD;
and met the gaze ofAgustus Thornton. Her&#xD;
countenance grew'pale as death and the next&#xD;
instant was suffused with crimson.&#xD;
Thornton seemed deeply abstracted, and&#xD;
did not notice the agitation of Ida. Bowing&#xD;
coldly to her, without speaking, he was pas-&#xD;

"Hold, Augustus! A sword with you, if&#xD;
you please," exclaimed the young woman.&#xD;

ly inquired.&#xD;
"What is your pleasure, Miss Walton I"&#xD;
Like an ice~boltto the maiden's he~t, were&#xD;
those few chilling words of Thornton. A&#xD;
tremorrtrn through her frame, and the blood&#xD;
forsook her cheek.&#xD;
"NothAig-nothing!" And motioning&#xD;
him to leave her, retreating backward, she&#xD;
sunk again upon the rustic acat.&#xD;
Thornton approached her, not knowing&#xD;
what to make of' the lady's singular beha-&#xD;
vior.&#xD;
~'What is the matter?" he asked, alarmed.&#xD;
"Has anything happened-.happencd to&#xD;
U No! eo I leave me-begone," cried Ida,&#xD;
vehemently.&#xD;
"Nay madam. You do not seem to be&#xD;
well. Permit me to assist you to the house."&#xD;
"I require not yourkassistance. Your fur-&#xD;

Thornton could only obey her command,&#xD;
wondering what to make of the singular cir-&#xD;
cumstance. He had never spoken a word to&#xD;
her before in his life, and was perplexed to&#xD;
know whether she labored under some tem-&#xD;
porary spell' of insanity. He however, in-&#xD;
stantly resolved to enter the mansion, and&#xD;
direct some of'the female domestics to go to&#xD;
the assistance of the poor demented creattire,&#xD;
if such she really was.&#xD;
"Has it come to that?" murmured Ida,&#xD;
bitterly, assoonas Thoratonhad dissippeared.&#xD;
"He was a. anxiety for her safety. I see it&#xD;

to the drawing-room, in search of'Conradin,&#xD;
where she was informed by a servant that&#xD;
he had gone out with her, cousin Ida, on&#xD;
an evening visit to one of the neighbors-&#xD;
Scarcely, however, had she left her chasm-&#xD;
her, ere the tall figure of a man closely dis-&#xD;
guised, stole from beneath the drapery of&#xD;
7 the sleeping couch, and passed out cf the&#xD;
apartment, muttering as he went-&#xD;
"The stratagem works admirably! The&#xD;
poor silly turtle-dove shall not now escape&#xD;
the fowler's snare I"&#xD;
"And I will thwart &amp;amp;Ioa both! I will&#xD;

This enigmatical language was pronoun-&#xD;
ced by another figure, having the semblance&#xD;
of a young female, of medium height, also&#xD;
closely disguised, who followed quickly in&#xD;
the steps of the first intruder who had just&#xD;
quitted the boudoir of that fair young wife.&#xD;
Mary again returned to her chamber,&#xD;
threw herself into a large rocking-chair, and&#xD;
awaited patiently for the hour of interview&#xD;
with Thornton.&#xD;
But time passed by on leaden wings.&#xD;
Drowsiness overcame her senses. The pop-&#xD;
pies of Nox were placed to her eye-lids, and&#xD;
she slept-as purity may ever sleep-calmly&#xD;
and sweetly, whatever the phantoms and ter-&#xD;
rors of the nocturnal season.&#xD;
When she awoke from that long and&#xD;
blessed slumber, the sun was already up and&#xD;
shedding its rich golden tints over the face&#xD;
of nature. The birds among the trees of the&#xD;
garden were singing their matin hymns,&#xD;
while the zephyra of morning were laden&#xD;
with the fragrance gathered from the many&#xD;
thousand sweet dew-bathed flowers that&#xD;
bloomed around.&#xD;
She instantly remembered the proposed&#xD;
assignation with Thornton, and though it&#xD;
was broad daylight, she hastened to the ar-&#xD;
bor that had been designated, not indeed&#xD;
with the expectation of meeting him, but&#xD;
pith some vague idea she would there find&#xD;
&#xD;
iT RIRBONS.                        13&#xD;
some token~that he had punctually awaited&#xD;
her coming.&#xD;
She walked swiftly along, brushing the&#xD;
dew-gems from the grass and flowers as she&#xD;
passed. to the place of rendezvous. The&#xD;
snowy shafts of the fountain presently&#xD;
shot up among the green shrubbery, and she&#xD;
beheld with pleasure the liquid crystal that&#xD;
fell in showers from thejet d'eau into the&#xD;
basin of the fountain. due bound more and&#xD;
she had entered the garlanded retreat of the&#xD;
~rbor near at hand.&#xD;
#Ohhorror of horror! the sight that greets&#xD;
ed her eyes. There was a pool of fresh hu.&#xD;
man blood on the floor of the arbor, and all&#xD;
around traces of a desperate encounter be.&#xD;
tween a number of individuals. The egl~n~&#xD;
tines and honey-suckles lay trailing in blood&#xD;
and dust. The lattice work of one side of&#xD;
the arbor was completely torn away, and&#xD;
there was a trail as if some heavy body had&#xD;
been dragged through thegrass, over a bed of&#xD;
violets and along the graveled walks for the&#xD;
distance of fifty yards to the water's edge of&#xD;
the Schuylkill, when all traces of the vio-&#xD;
Ignee in this direction were lost.&#xD;
Mary uttered a wild scream of alarm? ned&#xD;
fleeing to the house, fell into a terrible se-&#xD;
ries of convulsions, wl~ich rendered her un~&#xD;
conscious of all that transpired for several&#xD;
weeks afterwards.&#xD;
Meanwhile the report of the terrible and&#xD;
mysterious tragedy was carried fair and&#xD;
near, and led to a thorough search of the&#xD;
premises for some clue to i~s enactment. A&#xD;
fragment of. a man's eoat-the hood and&#xD;
scarf of a female--and a large dh-k ktiife&#xD;
crimsoned with gore-were picked up among&#xD;
the grass and flowers, but no human body&#xD;
or bcdic~. were discovered. The piece of&#xD;
coat was identified as a fragment of one&#xD;
usually worn by Augustus Thornton, the&#xD;
scarf and hood were the property of Mary&#xD;
- Walsingham, and the dirk knife that of bes&#xD;
husband.&#xD;

NEAR the corner of Front and Dock streets&#xD;
stands a two-storied brick house, painted&#xD;
yellow, which was once the residriura of a&#xD;
well-known Swede, and built by him more&#xD;
than a century ago. At the time of which&#xD;
we, now write, it was occupied by an elderly&#xD;
Irish woman, ~hc worthy widow Cathicen&#xD;
O'Harra, and her daughter Norah, a&#xD;
sprightly, intelligent and rather pretty erca-&#xD;
tt~re, just passing from girlhood to womanly&#xD;
~xisaturity. The lower part of the house was&#xD;
used as a fruit and herb shop, which was al-&#xD;
tcrna~ely attended by the widow and her&#xD;
si~pghter, or, more correctly speaking, gener-&#xD;
~y by the young girl, since the mother was&#xD;

It was the list night of the month of .Janu-&#xD;

It was about the hour of midnight, and&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
DESOLATION-TUE HAUNTED Housn.&#xD;
Fifteen years had passed since the night&#xD;
of the tragic horrors-in the garden of the&#xD;
merchant Walaingham, without further clue&#xD;
having been obtained in elucidation of their&#xD;
terrible mysteries.&#xD;
The lovely girl Ida Walton, and Thornton&#xD;
and Walsingham, all disappeared on that&#xD;
occasion, and nothing had ever been revealed&#xD;
to give positive assurance of either the death&#xD;
or survival of the whole, or any one or more&#xD;
0f the parties.&#xD;
The supposition, however, generally pre-&#xD;
vailed that Ida aid Walsiugham had both&#xD;

ebants clerk, and in their interference had&#xD;
be~onie involved in some inexlicable denon-&#xD;
ment of the circumstances.&#xD;

of Thornton's seeming partiality for her&#xD;
cousin, had determined to anticipate the clan.&#xD;

Ida, mistaken her for his wife, and Thorn-&#xD;
ton in the arbor at the midnight hour, and&#xD;
sacrificed them both in the wild phrenzy of&#xD;
his jealousy and revenge. This preparation&#xD;
for a departure to a distant city on business&#xD;
was thought to be a ruse, the better to ena-&#xD;
ble him to watch the conduct of his wife and&#xD;
Thornton, both of whom he had, for s~n~e&#xD;
cause or other, learned to diatrust. This&#xD;
opinion was strengthened when it became&#xD;
known that the ships supposed to have been&#xD;
lost had arrived safely in the harbor of New&#xD;
York.&#xD;
Yet he might have fallen in death by the&#xD;
hands of ThorntOn, in the reneontr~ of the&#xD;
evening. He was wealthy, and a man&#xD;
much respected and esteemed in the social&#xD;
and commercial community. Was it likely&#xD;

with Balty, to the said young ladies interest,&#xD;
and her own and her lover's delight.&#xD;
"What's acted, Balty ?" asked Sally, as the&#xD;
young man produced from his hat a five-&#xD;
inch square piece of "taffy," or molasses&#xD;
&#xD;
cand presented it to her.&#xD;
"Well, it's a damned hard sort of name&#xD;

literal Balty&#xD;
"Oh don't be a foo-foo, Balty," said the&#xD;
giri playfully. "You knjw what I mean I"&#xD;
The young beau puffe'~l a little smoke&#xD;
among the cherry colored ribbons, and re-&#xD;
turned to the subject.&#xD;
"It's a grcat drama, Sal ; and has four com-&#xD;
bats inter it, and six bloody murders, and&#xD;
Forrest and Scott both get killed in it."&#xD;
"Law me! that's real nice, I declare."&#xD;
"I was told all about it 'by Beefy, whose'&#xD;
bec~ twice to see it, and he said there was&#xD;
beside a sailor's horupipe dance, and a heap&#xD;
of comical futand odd things, mixed all up&#xD;
with Long Tom Coffin and Blue-eyed Susan,&#xD;
I'd have you know, Sal."&#xD;
"That's a first-rate piece, Balty, you'd be-&#xD;
lieve it.'~&#xD;
"Taint nothing' else, I seen once afore.&#xD;
£~ ~lo it while ye're young,&#xD;
Forwhen you're old you ca-n-n't~"&#xD;
"Be quiet, now, Balty; and don't be&#xD;
sassy," interposed Saral~, as in the exuber-&#xD;
Bnce of his animal spirits, the lover began to&#xD;
make certain heel and toe demonstrations&#xD;
on the pavement, in a very vigorous manner.&#xD;
"Can't help carry on a little, Sal," replied&#xD;
"Balty; when we're mar-"&#xD;
"Here, now, stop your foolia', or i'll git&#xD;
[~          real mad right off, so I will. Let's go long,&#xD;

T RIBBONS.&#xD;
She placed her hand on his lips to pre-&#xD;
vent a reply-squeezed his arm in her's&#xD;
tightly-Aooked up in his face in a smihugand&#xD;
coaxing sort of manner, and-went sailing&#xD;
along in the direction of the theatre.&#xD;
In less than ten minutes the lovers are&#xD;
comfortably see~ted in the front of the second&#xD;
tier of boxes. Here Balty took a further&#xD;
supply of candy, together with a pint of pea-&#xD;
nuts and several big apples from his hat&#xD;
and dropped them into Sally's lap; after&#xD;
which lie spread out the play bill on tb rail*&#xD;
ing before his girl, and gave himself up com-&#xD;
pletely to the enjoyments of the evening&#xD;
The overture is over. The whistling, y~l-&#xD;
hugs, crying out of "Boots ~ stamp-&#xD;
ings, et center, are dispelled by the bell ring-&#xD;
ing and the rise of the curtain. All eyes are&#xD;
on the stage, and all attention fixed on the&#xD;
soul absorbing drama. Of this immortal&#xD;
play, it were ~eedless for uS now to speak-&#xD;
further than to say that on the present occa-&#xD;
sion, it was appreciated in tb~ highest de-&#xD;
gree by Baltyand Sally, and the rest of the&#xD;
audience, until an unexpected occurrence&#xD;
took place, which suspended Balty'~ voci-&#xD;
ferous applause and rather ruffled his tens.&#xD;
per for the rest of the evening~ It was this.&#xD;
At the close of the first act, the dcor of&#xD;
the box in which the lovers were seated wa~&#xD;
opened, and a strange gentleman, of' foreign&#xD;
appearance, entered, and crowded himselt'&#xD;
into the pew immediately in the ~r of&#xD;
where Sally sat. Now this alone was not an&#xD;
uncommon o' startling circumstance-e~ii&#xD;
when coupled with the facts that the strai~ga'&#xD;
gentleman had a large bushy moustache of&#xD;
extreme stiffness, green spectacles, and a&#xD;
long cadaverous face overshadowed by a pro-&#xD;
fuaion of long hair; but when this strange&#xD;
gentleman met the casual glance of Mhi&#xD;
Sally Bulser, and returned the same with a&#xD;
smack of his lips and a significant wink, the&#xD;
blood of Balty was up to near fever heat on&#xD;
the instant.&#xD;
Possibly Sally had not deserved such im-&#xD;
pertinent, not to say solucious attention.-&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="24-25 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC8196-00000013"/>&#xD;
24&#xD;
&#xD;
THE BLIJE BEARDS&#xD;
&#xD;
Possibly she had. Sure it is, at the expira-&#xD;
tion of less than five minutes, Sally felt con-&#xD;
utrained tt~1oQk round again. Balty watched&#xD;
her movements, and turned round his eyes&#xD;
also, and caught the foreigner linking and&#xD;
smacking his lips again at Sally\&#xD;
"Say, old hos~ I" interfered Ba y; "Gin&#xD;
us none of your 'pertinence, or I'll lamm yer&#xD;
right off the reel, see if I don't."&#xD;
The strange gentleman gased at him wth&#xD;
a vacant stare, gros~ned 'i~io1ently. dived his&#xD;
hands into the bottom of his snuff~colored&#xD;
surtout, brought up a brass tobacco-box, and&#xD;
with a most condescending air of patronage,&#xD;
presented it to the indignant apprentice&#xD;
butcher 1n4.&#xD;
"Hell 1d'ye think iwan'tbaeco," exclaim.&#xD;
cd Balty, "don't know english, I s'pose See&#xD;
here-" and he4elegraphed Miss Sally with&#xD;
his finger-?"None of your cheek here I D'ye&#xD;
understand ?"&#xD;
The strange gentleman opened his mouth,&#xD;
tapped with. his fore finger on the bridge 'of&#xD;
his large aquiline nose, ~winked again, and&#xD;
held forth his snuff-box to Miss Sally Bulser.&#xD;
The young lady went spontaneously to a&#xD;
fi~t of laughter; but Baltywas speechless with&#xD;
indignation; while the strange gentleman&#xD;
looked inexpressibly delighted.&#xD;
Fortunately, further colloquy was inter-&#xD;
rupted, by the curtain rising f~.r the second&#xD;
act of th~ drama, leaving Balty now no other&#xD;
alternative but to "cuss" internally, which&#xD;
he most decidedlydid. .His attention could no&#xD;
longerrdst upon the playing an undivided man-&#xD;
ner, and his eyes. frequently turned threat-&#xD;
eningly upon the strange gentleman.&#xD;
At length he detected him devouring in a&#xD;
ravenous manner, a large apple, just like one&#xD;
of those he had placed in ~ally's lap. He,'&#xD;
darted an Othello-like look at his girl Her&#xD;
face was red----very red, certainly-yet her&#xD;
attention certainly seemed entirely fixed on&#xD;
the play.&#xD;
"Say Sal"-whispered he, "Did you gin's&#xD;
Sally gave him an energetic push, and cx-&#xD;
claime4 impatiently, "Shut up, do"&#xD;
&#xD;
Balty did as he was commanded, it but&#xD;
was plain to be seen, he but nursed his wrath&#xD;
to keep it warm, till the end of the act. At&#xD;
length the curtain fell, and the explanation&#xD;
came,&#xD;
"Don't kick up a mussy Balty, and I'll&#xD;
tell yer. Promise ?"&#xD;
"Well, I won't," said Balty, hissing out&#xD;
the word between his clenched teeth.~-.&#xD;
"Now-"&#xD;
Why, he put ~iis hand over and took the&#xD;
apple out of my lap. I didn't see him done&#xD;
till he, got it."&#xD;
"Put his hands, into your lap! I'lls-&#xD;
"Oh hush up Balty. See, I don't think&#xD;
he means nuthin'-he ain't looking this ere&#xD;
way at all, now ?"&#xD;
This was true. The strange gentleman&#xD;
had relapsed into a deep reverie, or profound&#xD;
sleep, we don't know which, in 'which peace-&#xD;
ble condition he remained till the play was&#xD;
over.&#xD;
The rage of Bully had vooled down alto.&#xD;
gather ; and however much he delighted in&#xD;
any fuss or fight, he didn't like to show much&#xD;
of his pugnacity before his sweetheart Sally~&#xD;
He gallantly assisted her to place her s~iawl,&#xD;
and thrusting her arm under his own, they&#xD;
passed down the crowded stairs, an4 stood&#xD;
on the pavement outside. The strange gen-&#xD;
tleman stood at the side of Sally and thus&#xD;
addressed her&#xD;
"Vill a you permit-a-me to wispar in your&#xD;
ear von vorde, Madamoiselle-.one ver leetle&#xD;
woivl - immediately, vat you call right&#xD;

Balty's rage kindled again instantly.&#xD;
"DL.m yer iinperdence, you forr'n bug.&#xD;

Maketracks while yer hide is good, or I'll&#xD;
smash yer right off, I will."&#xD;
"You are ver God d-m rude sare I Vill&#xD;

He uttcrc&amp;amp;a shriek as never before came&#xD;
out of mortal throat, and darted away with&#xD;
the speed of lightning.&#xD;

daughters possessed in the art of embroider.&#xD;
ing and producing other delicate articles of&#xD;
costume, which were privately disposed of by&#xD;
the mother at one of the principal fancy&#xD;
stores of the town. Of course, as might be&#xD;
imagined from the outline we have given of&#xD;
the family, Mrs. Temple was in fact, and ne-&#xD;
cessarily so, the ruling spirit of the house,&#xD;
and seemingly kept every thing in admirable&#xD;
order in and about the household of which&#xD;
she was now the acknowledged head and&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
We must now speak of another Yfarnily-or&#xD;
rather of some members of the same-as in.&#xD;
evolved in the singular circumstances of crime&#xD;
'and horror that ~rexnains to be developed in&#xD;
our veritable narrative. This 4yas a family&#xD;
by the name of La Rue, who resided in Se.&#xD;
cond Street, just below Race. David La Rue&#xD;
was a native of France, and now pursued the&#xD;
business of jeweler, and was reported very&#xD;
wealthy. This family consisted only of La&#xD;
Rue, his wife, and Antoine, a son, now a&#xD;
young man of about twenty-three years of&#xD;
age.&#xD;
The elder La Rue possessed two very&#xD;
strong passions-the one to amass wealth'&#xD;
and the other to witness his son, as he often&#xD;
termed it, shine a star of the first magnitude.&#xD;
He would work day and night to accumulate&#xD;
riches, but made no stint of lavishing it upon&#xD;
this hopeful heir Antoine-a paradox which&#xD;
often presents itself among men of this na-&#xD;
ture.&#xD;
Among the fashionable traits which the&#xD;
younger La Rue possessed was that of gain.&#xD;
hUng. He was' considered a fat pigeon by&#xD;
the gentlemen of this fraternity, atid though&#xD;
he often got quite unmercifully picked, his&#xD;
purse was readily ieplenished from the cof-&#xD;
fers of his indulgent father, so that such things&#xD;
as pecuniary losses never disturbed the ecjuan.&#xD;
unity of his temper. In a word, to finish the&#xD;
character of young La Rue, he wa~ thorough-&#xD;

city) while his moral traits from organization&#xD;
had ~ever been very exalted, although his&#xD;
education had not been by any means neglect-&#xD;
ed, so far as he was a graduate of one of the&#xD;
first colleges in the land1 prior to falling in&#xD;
with evil company, who were now almost his&#xD;
exclusive associates and friends, He played&#xD;
an admirabl&amp;amp;game of billiards, drove a cur-&#xD;
ride with any m~tn; and was fully proficient&#xD;
in all the dissipations and follies of the day.&#xD;
Antoine La Rue had became quite inti&#xD;
mate in the family of the Temples, and seem-&#xD;
ed to have taken a strong fancy for Helen,&#xD;
which predilections Mrs. Temple seemed to&#xD;
view with lively interest ~nd favorprobably&#xD;
looking to the wealth that young La Rue&#xD;
would inherit from his father.&#xD;
Helen, howev.ir, had cast her eyes on a&#xD;
young man, named Charles Poihemus, who&#xD;
officiated as a clerk in a drug store in the&#xD;
neighborhood. Polhemus had received an&#xD;
excellent education, and having studied&#xD;
physic and pharmacy, he finally e~iose the&#xD;
business of a druggist's clerk for his support.&#xD;
He was about tweiity.two years of age -of&#xD;
very delicate frame, pale face, fair skin, blue&#xD;
eyes, and the usual characteristics of such&#xD;
peculiar physical and mental organization.&#xD;
He was somewhat of a recluse in ,his habits,&#xD;
scarcely mingling in society, or visiting any&#xD;
place of amusements. His knowledge of the&#xD;
world, or its worst phases, therefore, was as&#xD;
limited as that of a child. He seemed to&#xD;
have no idea of the heated passions and evil&#xD;
propensities of man, but in his innocence&#xD;
imagined the world composed of beings as&#xD;
pure as himself, or tho~e few persons with&#xD;
whom lie associated.. His acquaintance with&#xD;
the female sex was exceedingly limited, but&#xD;
he had been introduced to both Helen and&#xD;
BlancheTemple, and almost instantly hadhis&#xD;
tenderst sympathies enlisted in favor of&#xD;
Blanche, who seemed to him the poet's dream&#xD;
of loveliness personified.&#xD;

CHAPTER IX.&#xD;
Tan LIBERTINE'S STRATAGEM I-" Tan&#xD;
BIRDIE ZN THE CAGE !"-FoUL INTENT.&#xD;
True to his promise, so ironically made to&#xD;
his master, the menial Armond visited High&#xD;
street market, and found little difficulty in&#xD;
inducing Minny Dawson, the innocent and&#xD;
unsuspecting flower-girl to bring her floral&#xD;
treasures to the house of the rich merchant&#xD;
Arlington, hy alleging that he designed giv-&#xD;
ing a ball on the evening of that day, and&#xD;
would pay liberally for the rarest boquits&#xD;
that could be furnished for the occasion.-&#xD;
'1'he business was managed so cautiously&#xD;
by the wiley servant, that among those who&#xD;
trafficked in the market, no cue knew any-&#xD;
thing of it, and naturally supposed that she&#xD;
had disposed of her flowers, and returned&#xD;
home to the cottage of her father.&#xD;
~iinny Dawson was yet but mere a child&#xD;
in years, her age being about fourteen years,&#xD;
but there was that voluptuousness in her&#xD;
form that already betokened the full ripeucas&#xD;
and glory of young womanhood. Her au-&#xD;
burn hair was plaited neatly over her smooth&#xD;
forehead, and so arranged to f~il in a shower&#xD;
of ringlets upon her shonklers, thereby fort,,-&#xD;
ing a contrast between the ~ia~hing skin&#xD;
&#xD;
and the sunny hair that might well captivate&#xD;
the eye and sensuality and awaken intense&#xD;
passion in the most stoical of bosoms. Her's&#xD;
wasa beauty such as&#xD;
&#xD;
"Guido would have loved to dwell upoc ;"&#xD;
but, as we are not au fait in describing the&#xD;
comparative qualities of woman's charms, we&#xD;
leave the reader to draw up on his own im-&#xD;
agination for every attribute of sweetness&#xD;
and grace, and yield thens as he legiti-&#xD;
mate concomitants of the re'mailiable loveli-&#xD;
ness of Minny Dawson.&#xD;
in less than an hour from the time she&#xD;
was accosted in the market by Armond, she&#xD;
found herself seated in a large back parlor of&#xD;
the rich merchant's house. Here she was&#xD;
requested to wait a short time till Mr. Ar-&#xD;
lington should take his breakfast and inspect&#xD;
the sweet flowers for himself, before paying&#xD;
for them.&#xD;
Au hour passed, and then another, and&#xD;
she remained alone in that gorgeous room&#xD;
into which 4he had at first been ushered,&#xD;
wondering the while that the owner of the&#xD;
mansion, or some other person did not enter,&#xD;
inspect her flowers, and let her depart.&#xD;
She had full time to observe the beautiful&#xD;
paintings that hung in splendid gilt frames&#xD;
against the walls-the exquisite pieces of&#xD;
statuary th6± stood in the recesses of the&#xD;
room-the large mirrors-the chandelier of&#xD;
cut glass-the rich curtains of the windows,&#xD;
the costly furniture, and a Turkey carpet&#xD;
that blazed in the riches of its roses and&#xD;
other floral devices, while it was as soft as a&#xD;
field of moss to the feet.&#xD;
Her patience at length became entirely&#xD;
exhausted, and becoming alarmed at the&#xD;
silence which prevailed, she rose and went&#xD;
to the door that led to the hall. She found&#xD;
it was locked from the outside, and realized&#xD;
in full force that she was a prisoner! She&#xD;
uttered a loud scream, and kept up the out-&#xD;
cry at so.wild a rate, that the wretch Ar-&#xD;
&#xD;
.37&#xD;
&#xD;
moral felt constrained to show hi~ presence&#xD;
in order to quiet her clamor.&#xD;
"What is all this outcry about," he said,&#xD;
"in a gentleman's house? You have been&#xD;
screaming as if somebody was murdering you&#xD;
outright, my pretty miss! ~on't be alarmed&#xD;
-no one is going to kill you, any howl But&#xD;
you have got to wait till my master shall&#xD;
come in. He must have forgotten you were&#xD;
here when he left the house this morning."&#xD;
"Oh, then, I can't stay. I must gd and&#xD;
sell my flowers. See they are all drooping&#xD;
already. Indeed I mu~tgo Do, sir, let me&#xD;
go and sell my flowers in the market before&#xD;
they all loose their freshness and fragrance.&#xD;
Please do, sir I"&#xD;
"Oh, no, thal will never'do! The house.&#xD;
keeper will put the flowers in fresh water,&#xD;
and you must remain here till my master&#xD;
shall come home and give you the money for&#xD;
them. Here, Margeryl Margeryl the girl&#xD;
wants to go away."&#xD;
The housekeeper, a sinister looking old&#xD;
hag, of fifty years, now made her appearance,&#xD;
and said to the girl:-&#xD;
"The pretty birdie is in the cage at last,&#xD;
and we cannot let her go before the master&#xD;
comes to hear it sing! Oh. no, miss, you&#xD;
mu~t not leave the house. He'll be here by-.&#xD;
and-by, and pay you for the roses, maybe,&#xD;
and let you go?"&#xD;
There was that in the looks and speech of&#xD;
the old hag. that more and more alarmed the&#xD;
flower girl. She threw herself on her knees,&#xD;
an4 begged permission to depart at once&#xD;
from the house&#xD;
"I have ~been too long away already..-.&#xD;
My poor old father will be verynnessy about&#xD;
me, if I do not soon be at home. I have&#xD;
been here a long while. Oh do let me go&#xD;
home l"&#xD;
~' Oh, no, we dare not let you depart. The&#xD;
master would be very angry with us if we&#xD;
did. Be quiet, my pretty dear, and take a&#xD;

Such strange tnd inconiprehensibl(&#xD;

with no little amusement, commingled&#xD;
with terror. He muttered-&#xD;
" "I understand you not. She is no&#xD;

Arlington heeded not the words of the&#xD;

her black deliverer.&#xD;
The dwarf finding that his only chance&#xD;
of escape was by maiming, or killing his&#xD;
*hite adversary outright, let slip his long&#xD;
sharp bladewith tremendous energy into&#xD;
the bosom of Arlington. He fell be-&#xD;

as from a fatal wound!&#xD;

His fearful cries of murder, brought&#xD;
his servants Armand and Margery to the&#xD;
hall just as the African had gained the&#xD;
uner or screen door of the passage, near&#xD;
the street door.&#xD;
Armond instantly comprehended the&#xD;
whole affair, and rushing forward, he&#xD;
struck a heavy blow upon the back part&#xD;
of Black Roif, which felled him to the&#xD;
fioor~ as in death.&#xD;

Armand tore the sooty garments from&#xD;
the sweep, quickly bound his arms and&#xD;
feet, (although th~ still insensible con-&#xD;
dition of the Dwarf, rendered such pro-&#xD;
cedure unnecessary,) dragged him, by&#xD;
main force, as he would the dead carcass&#xD;
of a dog, througji a dark passage and&#xD;
down a slimy flight of steps to the dismal&#xD;
vault indicated by his master, where he&#xD;
thrust the helpless negro and left him&#xD;
utterly to perish.&#xD;

stricken girl-conveyed her very gently&#xD;
to a neat and secluded boudoir-laid her&#xD;
&#xD;
(&#xD;
/&#xD;
&#xD;
carefully on a couch, and promptly ap-&#xD;
plied the usual remedies to arouse her to&#xD;
consciousness from the state of asphyxia&#xD;
into which she seemed to have fallen.&#xD;
Arlington now completely exhauste4&#xD;
by his struggle with the maiden and his&#xD;
fierce strife with Black Roif, threw him-&#xD;
self on a sofa in the parlor, and en~&#xD;
deavored to compose himself, as he was&#xD;
able, in the relaxation of his nerves and&#xD;
mental energies. What his reflections&#xD;
were may probably be imagined. They,&#xD;
however, found no utterance in words~&#xD;
At the end of some minutes, Armand&#xD;
entered the room, and reported the ful-&#xD;
filment Qf the commands he had received&#xD;
from his master.&#xD;
"The black imp is secure enough now~&#xD;

'Sweep, ho 1' on the housetop again. His&#xD;

some terrible orgies of spirits damned.&#xD;
George knew not how it was, but h~&#xD;
suddenly broke away from the awful&#xD;
rites of 'the terrible hag, nor looked be.&#xD;
hind him till he reached the river, shen&#xD;
he fell fainting in the arms of the old&#xD;
Waterman Switzer, who had accompanied&#xD;
him in his boat on hi~ errand to the cave&#xD;
of the Sorceress.&#xD;
The old man first laved George's brows&#xD;
with the cool waters of the Schuyl~dll-&#xD;
and then drawing a ~1ask of gin from his&#xD;
pocket, rubbed violently the wrists and&#xD;
hands of the stricken youth.&#xD;
The swoon was only of temporary du-&#xD;
ration, but on his recovery, the young&#xD;
man refused to inform his friend Switzer&#xD;
of what had occurred or been revealed to&#xD;
him in the wild den of the Red Witch.&#xD;
"Not now, good Switzerl Some&#xD;
other time I will reveal all. Quickly&#xD;
back again over the water. I have seen&#xD;
my dear sister in the Witch's mirror!&#xD;
But-but-oh God I Spars her! spare&#xD;

The old Waterman could comprehend&#xD;
nothing of this wild ar~d mysterious lan-&#xD;
guage. He at once concluded that&#xD;
George had gone sad-stark mad, and&#xD;
plied his oars to teach the city with all&#xD;
possible speed.&#xD;
The instant the boat touched the&#xD;
&#xD;
lie was soon out of sight~ and the old&#xD;
waterman did not venture to follow him.&#xD;
He could only return to the gardener's&#xD;
I cottage, explain matters as well as he was&#xD;
able to George's father, and await the&#xD;
issue of the wild youth's mysterious de-&#xD;

pursuit of his missing sister, agreeably&#xD;
to some mysterious information received&#xD;
by him from the Red Witch of Wissa-&#xD;

ters and other scenes necessary to be&#xD;
noticed in order to a full elucidation of&#xD;
our veritable narrative.&#xD;
Among the young ladies who pursued&#xD;
their studies at Mount Airy Female&#xD;
Boarding Seminary, during a part of the&#xD;
term while Mary Walton and her cousin&#xD;
Ida were inmates of the same institution,&#xD;
was Minerva Ilaybold, a your~g orphan&#xD;
heiress, from New Orleans, who had&#xD;
been placed in the care of tke Principal&#xD;
of the Boarding School, by her ward, a&#xD;
bachelor uncle of her mother, and now&#xD;
her only living relative.&#xD;

Arlington, after the marriage of Wal-&#xD;
sirigham, who at the time was his part-&#xD;
ner in business, in a branch establish-&#xD;
ruent of the father of the latter, was&#xD;
called to New Orleans on somebusiness&#xD;
connected with' a final possession of his&#xD;
wife's estate and inheritance in Louisiana.&#xD;
His absence was unavoidably prolonged,&#xD;
and he was still unable to fix a time for&#xD;
a return to his home in I~hiladelphia.&#xD;
Meantime, however, Arlington's house&#xD;
was ever daily and nightly a scene of~&#xD;
gayety and revelry. Visitors of both&#xD;
sexes came and went, scarcely without&#xD;
restraint, and with but little ceremony,&#xD;
and p~irticipat~d in the pleasures arid&#xD;
dissipatron which the generous hospi-&#xD;
'tality of Mrs. Arlington permitted to be&#xD;
pursued beneath her roof. These ex-&#xD;
cesses finally were calculated to arrest&#xD;
public attention,' from the promiscuous&#xD;
character of the guests-the sumptuous-&#xD;
ness of the entertainments, midnight&#xD;
orgies as they really wore, given and&#xD;
held by a young wife and most beautiful&#xD;
and voluptuous woman, while her hus.&#xD;
band was absent from home on business&#xD;
in a distant Southern city.&#xD;
There came to the entertainments&#xD;
given by Mrs. Arlington, during her&#xD;
husband's sojourn abroad, the savant, the&#xD;
sawyer, the clergyman, the statesman,&#xD;
&#xD;
the poet, and those of all grades of pur-&#xD;
suit and rank in society, including even&#xD;
the rouc and the gambler-among the&#xD;
latter two sort of people, none more noto-&#xD;
rious than a person ~ho we shall now&#xD;
introduce as Colonel Burlington, aria the&#xD;
youngnrcrehant, Walsirigham, who, how-&#xD;
ever, had but recently married Mary&#xD;
'Walton, the school companion of the&#xD;
whilom Minerva Raybold, Arlington's&#xD;
wife. Wakiinghaxn, in fnet, htwl been a&#xD;
suitor for the hand of Minerva Raybold,&#xD;

already pledged her troth to Arlington,&#xD;
he was necessarily forced to look in&#xD;
another quarter fora spouse, and, accord-&#xD;
ingly became the husband of Mary&#xD;
Walton.&#xD;
The intimacy which subsisted between&#xD;
the young wives of Walsirigham and&#xD;
Arlington was naturally very free and&#xD;
cordial. Indeed, so artless and confiding&#xD;
was Mrs. Arlington, that Walsirigham&#xD;
received her esteem and confidence-nor&#xD;
did she dream that by so doing she ren-&#xD;
dered her seemingly reckless yet really&#xD;
virtuous conduct open to scandal in the&#xD;
eyes of a censorious world. Her dispo-&#xD;
sition was volatile-her affections warm&#xD;
-her passions ardent-without a&#xD;
thought of what mischievous conse-&#xD;
quences would be likely to follow such&#xD;
gayety of character, unbalanced by strong&#xD;
reason and deep considerate reflection of&#xD;
the proprieties and conventionalities of&#xD;
society. She was a creature who acted&#xD;
from the strong impulses of her nature,&#xD;
nor reeked of the brink and peril upon&#xD;

upon a large conservatory, now redolent&#xD;
with the perfumes of a wilderness of&#xD;

strange. impulse he sprang to the door&#xD;
and locked himself in th~boudoirwith the&#xD;

sometime, when he came out into the&#xD;

The ball was over. Arlington arrived&#xD;

peared rather pleased than otherwise that&#xD;
his fair young wife, had so gayly and&#xD;
generously kept up the hospitalities of&#xD;
his house during his hbsenc&amp;amp; He&#xD;
dreamed of nothing, suspected nothing,&#xD;
implicating the purity of his wife.&#xD;
Several months elapsed when he dis.&#xD;
covere~l in a drawer of a bureau of hi~&#xD;
wife's boudoir, a letter scarcely becoming&#xD;
to be retained in the possession of a mar~&#xD;
ned woman. It breathed a fervency ol&#xD;
passion such as only lovers might feel in&#xD;
the honied hour of impassionate suit&#xD;
To this letter was attached a poetic&#xD;
fictionate name, while it was without date&#xD;
which proved very fortunate things a&#xD;
the time. This amorous billet-doux an&#xD;
rested the attention of Arlington, am&#xD;
induced him to examine a number o&#xD;
others that were its companions in th&#xD;
drawer. They were generally letters o&#xD;
&#xD;
friendship from her acquaintances, and&#xD;
her uncle, with some few of a more&#xD;
tender character that had been addressed&#xD;
to her by gallants who had sought to win&#xD;
her for a bride. They bore dates and&#xD;
proper signatures which left no d~ubt of&#xD;
havingbeen received by hiawifein an hono&#xD;
rably way prior to his marriage with her.&#xD;
His suspicions were aroused. The&#xD;
letter was in the hand writing of his&#xD;
friend and business partner, Wi~lsing-&#xD;
ham. His wife's rotundity of form, also&#xD;
indicated that she would shortly give&#xD;
birth to a child. He thought of his&#xD;
long absence from home, leaving his&#xD;
young and fascinating wife exposed to all&#xD;
the temptations of licentious society.&#xD;
His bosom was filled' with doubt. The&#xD;
more he doubted and reflected the more&#xD;
convinced he became of his wife's infi-&#xD;
delity. He could contain his suspicions&#xD;
no longer. He produced the fatal docu-&#xD;
ment and angrily charged the crime of&#xD;
adultery upon her. A violent quarrel&#xD;
was the result of her assertion of inno-&#xD;
cence. He would not however be satis-&#xD;
fied. He questioned his servants con-&#xD;
cerning her private habits during his&#xD;
long absence from home.&#xD;
The revelations that were made, were&#xD;
not calculated to relieve the uneasiness&#xD;
of mind under which he labored. Nay,&#xD;
F the proofs of his wife's guilt were clear&#xD;
and abundant. His servant Armond ic-&#xD;
lated the suspicious circumstance during&#xD;
1 th~ grand ball, when Walsinghann had&#xD;
been seen to come forth from the private&#xD;
t chamber of Mrs. Arlington. The female&#xD;
- domestics detailed the peculiar condition&#xD;
I in which they had found the young wife,&#xD;
f on that occasion, when they were sent to&#xD;
e her assistance by the command of Wal.&#xD;
f singham.&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
Arlington now compelled his wife to&#xD;
keep to the seclusion of her chamber,&#xD;
and gave it out that she had suddenly&#xD;
become afflicted with an eruptive malady,&#xD;
of an infectious character, which pre-&#xD;
cluded her from being seen by any one&#xD;
save her female attendants and the phy-&#xD;
sician. His word, backed by the solemn&#xD;
assertions of the solemn-visaged tool&#xD;
of Arlington, an unprincipled disciple of&#xD;
Esculapius, was not questioned, and so&#xD;
the matksr rested until she gave birth to&#xD;
her child, and died' either from&#xD;
the throes of labor or else from the ef-&#xD;
fects of poison administered in some&#xD;
wine of ergot that the physician admin-&#xD;
istered at the time.&#xD;
* The death of Mrs. Arlington was duly&#xD;
proclaimed, but the knowledge of her&#xD;
having given birth to a child was kept&#xD;
a secret from the world. He procured&#xD;
a private coffin, placed her remains in&#xD;
the same, and left it to mouldert into&#xD;
dust in the apartment in which the wo-&#xD;
man had died, locking the door, and&#xD;
sternly forbidding his domestics ever, to&#xD;
enter the chamber upon penalty of his&#xD;
great displeasure and punishment for the&#xD;
offence.&#xD;
Meantime, however, he ordered to be&#xD;
procured a most sumptuous burial case,&#xD;
with the showy hearse and mourning&#xD;
habliments, and 'passed through all the&#xD;
solemn ceremonials * of the obsequies, as&#xD;
though he mourned the l~oss of his wife&#xD;
and could not be comforted, when he saw&#xD;
the empty coffin consigned to a vault of&#xD;
the church where he so hypocritically&#xD;
prayed and worshipped.&#xD;
The midwife who officiated at the birth&#xD;
of the child was the worthy old mother&#xD;
O'Hara. This event took place during&#xD;
the same day, and within a few hours&#xD;
&#xD;
after her return home from the strange&#xD;
and mysterious birth-bed of the an-&#xD;
known~ darkly veiled lady of the gorgeous&#xD;
mansion, whose location was also un-&#xD;
known to her, somewhere over the waters&#xD;
of the Delaware, on the dread night of&#xD;
the terrible storm, as narrated in a pre-&#xD;
vious chapter.&#xD;
It was a strange coincidence, if nothing&#xD;
more. She received from the dying&#xD;
wife of Arlington a purse of gold, together&#xD;
with a piece of jewelry precisely of the&#xD;
same pattern and bearing the same initial&#xD;
letters as the gem given her by the veiled&#xD;
lady, whose child a few hours before&#xD;
she had brought to her humble home.&#xD;
The babe born to Mrs. Arlington wa~&#xD;
also conveyed to her dwelling by com-&#xD;
mand of Arlington, but being a very&#xD;
fragile thing, it survived but a few hours&#xD;
after Mother O'Hara's return to her&#xD;
domicile. She buried it secretly in the&#xD;
earth of her cellar, and kept her secret&#xD;
from all except her daughter Norah.&#xD;
The living child she soon disposed&#xD;
of in a matter satisfactory to her~ hu-&#xD;
manity and conscience. She managed&#xD;
to make the merchant Arlington believe&#xD;
that this child was the one that had been&#xD;
borne to his wife, and received for many&#xD;
years an annual suni of money for its&#xD;
support.&#xD;
At length, however, in the vicissitudes&#xD;
of human affairs this protege of the mid-&#xD;
wife and the merchant, became lost to&#xD;
them both, in the death or removal of&#xD;
the party in whose charge the infant girl&#xD;
had been placed.&#xD;
The reader will be at no loss to com-&#xD;

kiameless and homeless, when I fellundor&#xD;
Providence, beneath his sympathizing&#xD;
and guardianly care. You may be sure,&#xD;
sir, I was greatly astonished when about&#xD;
to return from Java; while at Batavia, to&#xD;
be informed that my young clerk was a&#xD;
woman. It was then that I more clearly&#xD;
comprehended the motivess which influ-&#xD;
enced her to assum~ the habilimonts of&#xD;
the opposite sex and risk the perils of an&#xD;
ocean life. ~ufflce it to say, she cher-&#xD;
ished some sweet pi~rposo in visiting the&#xD;
island, and begged permission to remain&#xD;
behind till she should be able to accom-&#xD;
plish the end thereof. I was convinced&#xD;
that her story was true, and sympathized&#xD;
with her wrongs. It was enough for me&#xD;
to apJ~rehend that the wrong-doer was&#xD;
supposed to be living in some part of&#xD;
Java, and therefore I questioned ~ier&#xD;
neither concerning her own proper name&#xD;
nor the one borne by the villain for whom&#xD;
she was in ~uch determined pursuit.&#xD;
When I offered to provide her with funds&#xD;
to further her designs, I found that her&#xD;
means were amply abundant. Indeed,&#xD;
she also insisted upon paying for her&#xD;
passage out, although she had served me&#xD;
~aithfnlly as a hand on boai~d the ship, to&#xD;
which proposition, of course, I would&#xD;
not listen. ' I provided her a comforta-&#xD;
ble home, in the bosom of a family of a&#xD;
respectable Dutch merchant, to await&#xD;
the issue of her affairs, and continued&#xD;
my' pursuits at sea. I parted from her,&#xD;
and did not meet her again until ten&#xD;
years afterwards, when I found her still&#xD;

not to be wantonly trespassed upon by&#xD;
the impertinence and curiosity of a med-&#xD;
dlesome and malicious world. Latterly,&#xD;
however, I have come to the conclusion&#xD;
that she is in some way or other connect-&#xD;

"We have then, as you say, only to&#xD;
await the issue of events, Captain. We&#xD;
cannot pull aside the curtainof the Past&#xD;
nor lift the veil of the Future. I must&#xD;
hide accordingly my time. But that lit.&#xD;
tle romance in your own history, Captain.&#xD;
It is yet early. Will you narrate it&#xD;
now?"&#xD;
"As you please, Walsiugham. I will&#xD;
make the story very short. I am fortu-&#xD;
nately able to give it more succinctly&#xD;
from a manuscript I happen now to have&#xD;
with me, which document I found among&#xD;
the papers of my deceased foster~father.&#xD;
It is to this effect: When I was a child'&#xD;
apparently about five years of age, I was&#xD;
*bund lying asleep under a small boat,&#xD;
which was placed bottom upwards on the&#xD;
deck of a schooner, which my foster-1&#xD;
father, Captain Van Veckten, com-&#xD;
manded, after it had left the wharf at&#xD;
Philadelphia and put to sea. I was too&#xD;
young to give any intelligible account of&#xD;
the manner how I came on board, or&#xD;
eve~i to give my family name. The&#xD;
Captain, however, took pity on my for&#xD;
bra condition, and although he realized&#xD;
that my parents must hay experienced&#xD;
poignant sorrow at my t~ them unac-&#xD;
countable disappearance, he did not feel&#xD;
warranted to put back to port and sur-&#xD;
render me to my friends. The voyage&#xD;
was to Canton, and it was two years be-&#xD;
fore he could return to Philadelphia and&#xD;
institute inquiry in my behalf. lie ad-&#xD;
surtised the circumstances under which&#xD;
I was found on board his ship, but re-&#xD;
ceived no response to his details. Mean-&#xD;
time he gave mc his own name, and con-&#xD;
&#xD;
tinted to me as a friend and father, from&#xD;
t~he first hour he saw me till the day of&#xD;
his death, a period of about twenty years&#xD;
altogether. It may interest you, also,&#xD;
my dear Walsiagham, that I have still&#xD;
in my possession the identical suit of&#xD;
clothing I wore at the time I was dis-&#xD;
covered in my infancy, so to speak, on&#xD;
board the 'Sea Gull,' which was the&#xD;
name of the craft, my good old friend,&#xD;
the skipper Van Veckten, then com-&#xD;
manded. I have likewise a full length&#xD;
portrait of myself, which the old Cap~ain&#xD;
caused to be painted on his return voyage&#xD;
with a view to ray identification by my&#xD;
friends. Besides these things, I have&#xD;
likewise a miniature of a lady, doubtless&#xD;
that of m~y mother, which was concealed&#xD;
in my bosom, suspended by a fine gold&#xD;
chain from my neck, at the time I was&#xD;
found by the Captain on board his vessel.&#xD;
This bauble. and the other articles, may&#xD;
possibly one of these days afford a clue&#xD;
to my own legitimate origin, though so&#xD;
many years have already passed,. I&#xD;
scarcely expect now 'ever to be en-&#xD;
lightened on so important and interest-&#xD;
ing a point."&#xD;
"Really, Captain Van Veckten, your&#xD;
own history is equally remarkable with&#xD;
that of the Wierd Sister of the Cave.&#xD;
It is certainly a romance in real life, cx-&#xD;
ceeding in interest any novel I have ever&#xD;
read."&#xD;
"Indeed, Conradin, my adventures&#xD;
~from first to last would make a book&#xD;
quite as entertaining as that of either&#xD;
"Sinbad the Sailor," "Jack the Giant&#xD;
Killer," or even "Oulliver's Travels,"&#xD;

Captain, what might be the upshot of&#xD;

"Yes, it might be the means of re-&#xD;

"Oh, I mind it nought, Wilkins. It's&#xD;
the pay that I look at. It will be a good&#xD;
job, I'll warrant me, when it's all over~.&#xD;
You see, I have yet to remove all this&#xD;
fresh earth to yonder new made grave,&#xD;
and this pit is to be made level with the&#xD;
surface and covered again with the green&#xD;
sods, so that none shall be the wiser of&#xD;
this night's work! Before sunrise,&#xD;
there'll be clean work of it, Wilkins, I'll&#xD;
warrant me, ha! ha! ha!"&#xD;
The old man began to wheeze and&#xD;
cough, from a turn of asthma after his&#xD;
garrulous rejoinder to the man he called&#xD;
Wilkins.&#xD;
"Aye, Phiiip; and I dare sayiL i~ Xiot&#xD;

"Mum's the word with me! The&#xD;

business, that's certain; but don't ~ou&#xD;
think it a great pity that the young and&#xD;
pretty girl should have come to her death&#xD;

"Well it was rather an ugly business,&#xD;

"Nay, nay, Wilkins. I must remain&#xD;
here. This grave must be made up in&#xD;

along yourself~ if you will, and thanks&#xD;
for your civilly, young man~"&#xD;
Wilkins turned to leave the ground,&#xD;
when George Dawson darted 'from his&#xD;
hiding place and seized him by the&#xD;
throat.&#xD;
"No, villain! You shall never leave&#xD;
these fields until I know whose remains&#xD;
are buried here! Tell me of Minny&#xD;
Dawson! You know my sister, the&#xD;
'Flower Girl.' Is she dead and buried&#xD;

Had an apparition appeared, the old&#xD;
grave-digger could not have been, more&#xD;
alarmed, and he stood shaking like one&#xD;
in a fi~of the ague; while Wilkins was&#xD;
so firmly held in George's grasp, that he&#xD;
could neither move nor speak.&#xD;
"Speak, wretch, I say, and tell me&#xD;
who is buried here ?" again demanded&#xD;
young Dawson.&#xD;
The man, gasping for breath, managed&#xD;
to mutter:&#xD;
"I don't know any thing about the&#xD;
girl, or how she came to her end."&#xD;
"Lying dog of hell, you 'know all&#xD;
about the matter, as I have just over-&#xD;
heard you say! Speak, villain, or I'll&#xD;
strangle you to death on the instant,"&#xD;
said George, firmly clenching the man'e&#xD;
neck and then suddenly hurling him&#xD;
headlong to the ground. "And you,&#xD;
hoary old seountrel, as I know you to be!&#xD;
Dig me now, instantly, anotl~r grave!&#xD;
&#xD;
Dig a pit, I say, on this very spot! I&#xD;
shall here avenge my wronged 'sister's&#xD;
death! As there is a God in Heaven,&#xD;
neither this wretch nor yourself shall&#xD;
leave these grounds, till I know of the&#xD;
hellish arts by which the poor child has&#xD;
come to this dismal end! Dig the pit,&#xD;
I say!"&#xD;
"Aye, good master! I'll dig the pit!&#xD;
I'll dig the pit! Little do I care who&#xD;
employs me, or whose bones they hide&#xD;
away in the earth! So that I get the&#xD;
money for the job, it's nothing to me-&#xD;
nothing to me," stammered th~ old&#xD;
wretch in his fear, although seemingly&#xD;
&#xD;
ready enough to bury even his ;best&#xD;
friend alive, in his avarice and greed.&#xD;
"Dig here! dig here! Open a hole&#xD;
quickly, and let me hurl him in, I siiy,&#xD;
hoary old Mattoeks !"&#xD;
George again darted to the fellow&#xD;
Wilkins, and threw the whole weight of&#xD;
his body on the man's neck and chest&#xD;
"Speak, sir! If you are guiltless of&#xD;
my ~sister's death, you shall depart with-&#xD;
out further harm. If you will not tell&#xD;
me all you know, you shall perish on the&#xD;
instant !"&#xD;
"Oh, you needn't ~crush the breath&#xD;
out of my body! I'll tell you all I&#xD;
know about the ugly business, Master&#xD;
Dawson !"&#xD;
"Well, do it, quickly then !"&#xD;
"The girl was young and pretty, it is&#xD;
very true, but what her name and&#xD;
whence she caine, I can not tell you, sir!&#xD;
But of her death I am entirely innocent!.&#xD;
Indeed, as Cod shall judge mc! lam,&#xD;
Mr. Dawson."&#xD;
"Who then is 'her destroyer? How&#xD;
did she come to her death! Reveal the&#xD;
truth and your life shall be spared."&#xD;
"So I will-so I will, sir. Return&#xD;
&#xD;
with me now, to the house of Cobuel&#xD;
Burrell, and you shall know everything&#xD;
about this work of crime and h~rror."&#xD;
"I will trust you, sir. Arise, and&#xD;
we'll go instantly to the accursed mur-&#xD;
derer's den."&#xD;
"I'll not deceive you, sir, that I will&#xD;
not! Indeed, I am anxious to release&#xD;
my conscience of the affair, and I care&#xD;
not if judge and jury shall hang me for&#xD;
my part in the foul deed!"&#xD;
"Enough I" cried George, ~letting&#xD;
Wilkins rise to his feet, but keeping&#xD;
him firmly grasped by the collar of his.&#xD;
coat. Turning to the old grave-digger,&#xD;
he added:&#xD;
"Hark you, old man! Finish up the&#xD;
dark work you have begun, nor disturb&#xD;
a sod again till you ~ar from me, at the&#xD;
peril of your life! There, take that, and&#xD;
begone from here, as soon as possible."&#xD;
He planed in the hands of the old&#xD;
man sevem4ml pieces of coin as he spoke;&#xD;
and, grasp ing Wilkins' arm, hurried&#xD;
away to the mansion. He had no time&#xD;
now to drop a tear over the grave of his&#xD;
supposed sister. His whole soul was&#xD;
absorbed with ofie terrible idea. His&#xD;
bosom burned for vengeance upon' the&#xD;
suspected seducer and murderer!&#xD;

to be thrown off his guard for an instant,&#xD;
and was ready to inflict summary pun-&#xD;
ishment upon Wilkins the moment he&#xD;
should detect anything like treachery or&#xD;
bad faith on his part in the promise he&#xD;
had voluntarily giVen to accompanyy him&#xD;
to the house of Colonel Burrelt.&#xD;
They hurried along in silence, and&#xD;
reached a' rear avenue that led to the&#xD;
stable and carriage house of the libertine&#xD;
Burrell, just at the moment that the town&#xD;
'clock struck the hour of two o'clock in&#xD;
the morning.&#xD;
The front part of the house was closed&#xD;
'snd had the appearance of being entirely&#xD;
untenanted The rear, however, was&#xD;
brilliantly illuminated, while strains of&#xD;
inspiring music, commingled with the&#xD;
sounds of revelry, came forth upon the&#xD;
balmy zephyrs of the morning hour.&#xD;
Colonel Burrell had returned from the&#xD;
theatre with a large party oi~ his friends,&#xD;
including a celebrated actress, in order&#xD;
to partake of a champagne supper, for&#xD;
which he bad previously arranged with&#xD;
his French cook.&#xD;
Thus it was, youth and beauty, the&#xD;
gay and the thoughtless, were there as-&#xD;
sembled, at that hour of night in the&#xD;
elegant and ample mansion of the dis-&#xD;
tinguished citizen and lawyer, libertine&#xD;
and villain as he was well known to be&#xD;
by the inhabitants generally.&#xD;
Thus it was that bright eyes flashed&#xD;
amid the glare of light from innumerable&#xD;
wax candles that filled the cups of the&#xD;
great chandeliers whose glass pendants&#xD;
hur~g down like diamond lobes, and&#xD;
sparkled brightly in the refulgence that&#xD;
was shed around.&#xD;
Thus it was that the merry strains of&#xD;
&#xD;
music arose on the calmness of the nioOri-&#xD;
shiny night-that the shuffling of many&#xD;
feet, and the joyous laugh, fold that the&#xD;
hours were being passed in the reveiryof&#xD;
a social and impromptu ball.&#xD;
IDawson and Wilkins passed through&#xD;
the stables and stood, in the middle of the&#xD;
garden beneath the shadow of a huge&#xD;
Italian chestnut tree, and watched the&#xD;
movements of the revellers as they&#xD;
passed to and from the windows, up and&#xD;
down the large saloon, in the mazy evo-&#xD;
lutions of the dance.&#xD;
Presently young iDawson caught a&#xD;
glimpse of the tall and elegant figure,&#xD;
'and dark grizzly hair, of the owner of&#xD;
the mansion. He saw him bend his&#xD;
smiling face close to the ear of the ac-&#xD;
tress and whisper something into her&#xD;
ears that caused her to smile bewitch-&#xD;
ingly, and to cast upon him a glance-&#xD;
oh, too full of 1~he wanton's coquetry and&#xD;
cunning, yet concealed, in sonic degi-ec,&#xD;

"I can contain myself no longer! I&#xD;
will rush in on him, and slay the vile&#xD;
seducer and murderer in the midst of his&#xD;
carnival of merriment and sensuality !"&#xD;
He made a bound as if to put his&#xD;
thoughts into execution; but Wilkins&#xD;
sprang forward also, grasped him by the&#xD;
arm, and, holding him back, exclaimed:&#xD;
"Nay, nay, Dawson! Be not thus so&#xD;
rash and headlong, lest you fail in your&#xD;

Burrell took the proffered pistol, and&#xD;
instantly discharged it in the face of his&#xD;
adversary. Fortunately the ball only&#xD;
grazed his cheek, leaving a mark, and&#xD;
causing a slight flow of blood. ,&#xD;
" Miserable paltroon," cried George,&#xD;
"your life is now completely in my po wer !&#xD;
Yet, if you have another pistol, procure&#xD;
it, and make the best of your chance for&#xD;

Burrell gazed around the room, and&#xD;
then quickly scanned the physical pro-&#xD;
portions of Dawson in contrast with his&#xD;
own. D~awson's frame was certainly&#xD;
considerably larger and heavier, but&#xD;
scarcely equal in muscu'ar power and&#xD;
pliability t~o that of his own. His first&#xD;
impulse was to rush forward, knock the&#xD;
pistol from the young man's hand, and&#xD;
by activity and main force hurl him into&#xD;
the dust.&#xD;
Dawson's quick eye detected something&#xD;

and he fired upon him. The ball took&#xD;
effect in Burrell's shoulder. He uttered&#xD;
a yell of pain and rage, and rushed like&#xD;
a wild boar uporn George. They grap-&#xD;
pled and strggled manfully together.&#xD;
but the ,Colonel soori found that he had&#xD;
a fair match in the youth, whose strong&#xD;
hands now pressed ,powerfully against&#xD;
his throat. The struggle -became more&#xD;
fierce.&#xD;
.Suddenly George received a terrible&#xD;
blow over his head, which caused him&#xD;
to reel around like a top, but without&#xD;
falling. His vision was completely knock-&#xD;
ed from him for the time being. Bur-&#xD;
rell saw the advantage he had gained-&#xD;
sprang upon George, and endeavored to&#xD;
throttle. the living principle from his&#xD;
body. He, however, quickly recovered&#xD;
his sight and equilibrium, and, raising&#xD;
his feet, with almost superhuman power&#xD;
he planted them full in the abdomen of&#xD;
Burrell, who instantly relaxed his hold&#xD;
upon the young man's neck, and stagger-&#xD;
ed backward, nearly overcome with pain&#xD;
and the loss of breath. ,Both of the an-&#xD;
tagonists had now a moment's respite,&#xD;
during which they respectively gathered&#xD;
wind and strength, when they again&#xD;
clutched in horrible strife Now the&#xD;
long hair of George fell over his eyes.&#xD;
This Burrell instantly seized, twisted&#xD;
round in his hand, and commenced&#xD;
dragging Dawson,as with giant's strength,&#xD;
towards the window.&#xD;
" Fool !" exclaimed Burrell, " would&#xD;
you grapple with a man who has never&#xD;
yet niet his equal in sinews and thews ?&#xD;
Ha ! ha ! It only remains for me to&#xD;
hurl you from this window t9 the depths&#xD;

Switzer, I was glad that my wife took a&#xD;
fancy to the strarIget~ darling, and agreed&#xD;
with her that we should adopt the child,&#xD;
and rear her as one of our flesh and&#xD;
blood."&#xD;
"Just like you both, T)awson. Your&#xD;
wife, I know, was a very tender-hearted&#xD;
woman. When I lost my own wife, and&#xD;
all my children, in one week, by the&#xD;
fever, your wife was always at our house,&#xD;
doing all that she could for our sick peo-&#xD;
ple. Oh, I 8hall never forget your wife.&#xD;
Heaven rest her, kind, good soul that&#xD;
she was, Dawson."&#xD;
"My son George was in his fifth ye~&#xD;
when his baby-brother died and little&#xD;
Ninny was given as his sister. But, as&#xD;
I was saying, it was a cold winter's&#xD;
night. There' had been a heavy fall of&#xD;
snow all the night before we buried our&#xD;
babe, and we had much difficulty to get&#xD;
to the grave-yard in our sleds, on account&#xD;
of the great depth of snow, which had&#xD;
Iot yet been broken down by travel ~o&#xD;
'soon after the storm. When we returned&#xD;
home, and wem all seated around a good&#xD;
'fire in the' little parlor there of this cot-&#xD;
Mge, we heard the cries of a young babe&#xD;
in our porch, which startled us very&#xD;
much. At first the cries sounded like&#xD;
the lamentations of a cat, and my wife&#xD;
bade me step to the door andlet in the&#xD;
old puss that was perishing in the cold.&#xD;
There was no cat there, but the dear&#xD;
babe. It was placed in the very thres-&#xD;
hold of the door, wrapped up warmly in&#xD;
a ~oarse blanket, lyin~ in a common&#xD;
market basket, and crying? for dear life.&#xD;
&#xD;
Ninny became our adopted child."&#xD;
I "And was there no one whom you&#xD;
suspected of placing the babe af your&#xD;
door-sill, good Dawson ?"&#xD;
* £~ No one whatever. We knew of no&#xD;
one likely to be it's mother in this neigh-&#xD;
borhood, and the great city was too far&#xD;
away to go and make much inquiry.&#xD;
We could imagine no clue to the child's&#xD;
parentage. There were many boot prints&#xD;
in the snow, but a goodly nun4er of&#xD;
our friends had attended the funeral of&#xD;
our cherub, and the snow marks we sup-&#xD;
posed were made by the company. I&#xD;
took up a dark lantern and looked all&#xD;
about the garden and sheds, but I dis&#xD;
covered nothing unusual. At length I&#xD;
found tracks in the garden in the rear&#xD;
and at one side of the house. There I&#xD;
followed and observed that they all point-&#xD;
ed as those of a person coming from the&#xD;
river to the cottage There was no trace&#xD;
of footsteps showing that the party re-&#xD;
traced his steps from the cottage to the&#xD;
water. The snow was a foot deep and&#xD;
very light, so I could not he certain these&#xD;
marks were by a rr~an or woman."&#xD;
"Butyou afterwards discovered, Daw-&#xD;
son, who the person was; or at least ob-&#xD;
tained some clue to the babe's parent..&#xD;
age?"&#xD;
"Nothing have I discovered of Miii-&#xD;
ny's origin from that day to this."&#xD;
"Was there no token or mark of any&#xD;
kind that pointed to the condition or po-&#xD;
sition of the parents of the babe ?"&#xD;
" Oh, yes, Switzer, the child was&#xD;

"But you would be likely to trace the&#xD;
infant's pedigree from this circumstance.&#xD;
Was there no other means by which it&#xD;
could be afterwards identified ?"&#xD;
"There was a heavy purse of eagles&#xD;
left with a small bundle of apparel. Stay&#xD;
a moment, good Switzer, and I will show&#xD;
you both the purse and the money"&#xD;
"Show me both the purse and the&#xD;
money! why have you-~--"&#xD;
"Have I them yet, you would inquire.&#xD;
Yes, Switzer, just as I first received&#xD;
them Not a penny has been taken out&#xD;
of th~ bag since we first ascertained the&#xD;
amount"&#xD;
"Why, Dawson, you amaze me&#xD;
The old gardener without replying&#xD;
went to a bureau, and speedily brought&#xD;
forth a large purse filled with coin, and&#xD;
placed it in the hands of Switzer.&#xD;
"The money is all there, I suppose,&#xD;
just as it was at first. I considered it a&#xD;
trust for the child, and have kept the~&#xD;
treasure sacred for her portion when she&#xD;
should become of age."&#xD;
"This is remarkable, indeed. You&#xD;
might well say her history was like a&#xD;
romance. Yea, I realize in great force&#xD;
what some author has said that "truth is&#xD;
stranger than fiction." But let me hear&#xD;
all the rest. It beats any story I ever f&#xD;

let the prayers of his poor old father in-&#xD;
tercede for him before the holy throne.&#xD;
Come Switzer-come George-let us all&#xD;
knee! and pray God to deliver us out of&#xD;
this sore trouble."&#xD;
On the instant, the father and son and&#xD;
friend dropped themselves upon their&#xD;
knees. There in the silence of the early&#xD;
morning hour, the stricken father offered&#xD;
a fervent, heartfelt petition for the de-&#xD;
&#xD;
r- liverance of his beloved son from crime&#xD;
o and for the repose ef his dead daughter's&#xD;

Suddenly the cottage door was thrust&#xD;

s young man, even there on his knees,&#xD;
while the aged parent prayed for his&#xD;

"You are our prisoner, sir I" cried&#xD;
I one of. the officers. You are charged&#xD;
with a foul murder and must go to pri.&#xD;

I "I am ready and willing, officers!"&#xD;
replied George in a quiet voice and&#xD;
composed manner. "Lead the way.&#xD;
The Walnut jail has no terrors for me.&#xD;
A jury of peers will try my cause, and&#xD;
I God will protect the just."&#xD;
"Nay, nay, do not drag him away&#xD;
I from his poor old father! Oh, my sea-&#xD;

"Grieve not in this way, my 'dear&#xD;

and Heav~n will not let him perish.&#xD;
Let him go-let the youth go with the&#xD;

&#xD;
in 'the house of Arlington, although she&#xD;
yet remitined ignorant of many mysteries&#xD;
in which she had became involved in her&#xD;
capacity of a midwife.&#xD;
"Now, Armand," said Margery, "the&#xD;
girl is sleeping soundly, and is not likely&#xD;
to awake for sonic hours to come. In.~&#xD;
deed, to make sure that she will not be&#xD;
disturbed in her slumbers, I have ad-&#xD;
ministered a sleeping portion that will&#xD;
keep her in that state, at least until the&#xD;
cock shall crow the break of morning.&#xD;
Will you now explain to me the meaning&#xD;
of the picture of the wonan with an&#xD;
asp sucking at her heart, which so&#xD;
frightened me when I passed through the&#xD;
Picture Gallery adjoining Thany's apart-&#xD;
ment this morning?'&#xD;
"Oh, certainly, Margery. There&#xD;
could be no better opportunity than the&#xD;
present to relate all about it."&#xD;
"The serpent mark on the bosom of&#xD;
the Floi~er Girl must in some way be&#xD;
connected with that strange picture, I&#xD;
am sure.~,&#xD;
"The thing is quite probable, Mar-&#xD;
gery."&#xD;
"This is the same villa, too, to which&#xD;
I was brought to deliver the babe, on&#xD;
that stormy night. I know it now by&#xD;
the dark drapery of the couch and win-&#xD;
dows of this room! These things re-&#xD;
main just a~ they were on that myste-&#xD;
rious occasioii. T he room, too, was cool,&#xD;
and there is yet the same old clock, and&#xD;
here the bust of General Washington,&#xD;
exactly in the same position they were&#xD;
at that time.&#xD;
"You ar~ right, Margery! Nothing&#xD;
'has been changed here since that child&#xD;
was born, and taken hence in your&#xD;
arms.&#xD;
"So IL thought, Armand."&#xD;
&#xD;
"The picture is called Cleppatra, and&#xD;
is grounded on some incident ~N the lives&#xD;
of that remarkable wom~in and Mark&#xD;
Anthony."&#xD;
"Ab, I see through it all now, Ar-&#xD;
mand. The veiled Jady who gave birth&#xD;
to the child I took away, must have re-&#xD;
ceived some aifright, or had her mind&#xD;
strongly impressed by the curious pic-&#xD;
ture, to leave so wonderful a birth-mark&#xD;
upon the bosom of her child"&#xD;
"Even so, I presume; but the doc-&#xD;
tors, IL believe, cannot satisfactorily ac-&#xD;
count for these strange freaks of dame&#xD;
Nature.&#xD;
"No, I suppose not; but what ~uz-&#xD;
zles me more Armand, is to really know&#xD;
whether the babe I took from hence can&#xD;
possibly be this Flower Girl, Minny Daw-&#xD;
son. I caused the babe to be left at the&#xD;
door of a cottage house on the banks of&#xD;
the Rancocas Creek, but some time af-&#xD;
terwards when IL desired to learn some-&#xD;
thing about the fate of the child, IL found&#xD;
that the cottagers had removed from the&#xD;
place, and I was accordingly unable to&#xD;
obtain any clue to her destiny.&#xD;
"But you made Arlington believe&#xD;
that the child lived and that you were&#xD;
obliged to pay over every year to certain&#xD;
parties a handsome sum of money for its&#xD;
support."&#xD;
"True, true, Armand, IL always made&#xD;
him believe his daughter was alive, but&#xD;
would never disclose to him in whose&#xD;
family she remained, for the simple rea-&#xD;
son IL knew nothing about it myself,&#xD;
Armand ;"&#xD;
"ILt would be a strange coincidence&#xD;
indeed, if two children should have&#xD;
the same marks on their breasts. No,&#xD;

tears&#xD;

secret part of his ship till the vessel&#xD;
sailed from Amsterdam. The treasures&#xD;
were not very bulky, some of them being&#xD;
diamonds. Ihad them all secured in little&#xD;
bags about my person, beneath my shirt&#xD;
and drawers. Just before tIe ship sailed&#xD;
*   I wa~hid in an empty hogahead, and ii,&#xD;
that condition passed out of Amsterdam&#xD;
without being discovered. The vessel&#xD;
was placed under the command of a sub-&#xD;
ordinate officer, who took the ship *to&#xD;
liavre and there received on board Cap.&#xD;
tam Arlington, who had made the jour-&#xD;
ney from Amsterdam to that place by&#xD;
the land route, having bad business of&#xD;
importance to transact in Paris. While&#xD;
in Paris, he sought out the shop of Beney,&#xD;
the jewEller, and obtained an interview&#xD;
with his mistress, the late paramour of&#xD;
the Prince of Holland, which interview&#xD;
resulted in the woman's desertion of Re-&#xD;
ney and sailing with Arlington as his&#xD;
mistress to the United States. Soon after&#xD;
his arrival in Philadelphia;. he entered&#xD;
into partnership with Harvey Walsing-&#xD;
ham, in theshipping and importing trade,&#xD;
living, at the same time, in much appa-&#xD;
rent harmony with his mistress, whom he&#xD;
acknowledged as his wife for several&#xD;
&#xD;
BEARDS&#xD;
months, when he administered a dose of&#xD;
poison, which destroyed her life. lie&#xD;
then gave out that she had committed&#xD;
suicide in some temporary fit of insanity,&#xD;
to which he alleged she was subject.-&#xD;
Being a man of irreproachable character,&#xD;
suspicion was readily diverte4 from him-&#xD;
self as her murderer. I was then very&#xD;
ignorant of almost everything of human&#xD;
life when I first placed myself in the&#xD;
power of Arlington; but when the wo-&#xD;
man died, I instinctively comprehended&#xD;
that we were both guilty of ter-ible&#xD;
crimeS, and so by a tacit understanding&#xD;
between ourselves under the nrcessity&#xD;
of the case, we became naturally attached&#xD;
to each other, with a view to the preser-&#xD;
vation of our respective secrets from the&#xD;
world. The jewels of the house of l3runs-&#xD;
wick were deposited in a safe place till all&#xD;
inquiry for them in Europe had ceased.&#xD;
By a private agreement between us I be-&#xD;
came his body servant-nay, seemingly&#xD;
in the eyes of the world, his most abject&#xD;
slave-with a view to a series of crimes&#xD;

When Armand and Margery had&#xD;

"You have heard, Margery, of th9&#xD;

"Certainly, and 1w inc1nired of hi&#xD;

was in the condition which most women&#xD;
delight to, be who love their lords."&#xD;
"You mean, Armand that she was&#xD;
likely to have a child."&#xD;
" Yes. The husband and wife had&#xD;
lived a year together without any signs&#xD;
of issue, before Arlington went to New&#xD;

Had they lived happily together&#xD;
during that time, Armaud ?"&#xD;

meeting her at inidnight, as proposed, re-&#xD;

about to leave the house, when he ob-&#xD;
served Mary standing in an arbor in the&#xD;
garden in conversation with her nephew&#xD;
C~onradin, and her cousin Ida. He con-&#xD;
cluded that he would also take a turn in&#xD;
the garden and wait an opportunity to&#xD;
address the young wife. Being regarded&#xD;
as the confidential clerk of Walsinghamn,&#xD;
he was treated more as an inmate of the&#xD;
merchant's house, and it was his wont to&#xD;
. .  make himself as agreable as possible both&#xD;
to Mary and her cousin Ida. Presently,&#xD;
seeing Mary was ,about to return to the&#xD;
house all alone, Ida and Conradin having&#xD;
quitted her side; he came forth from an&#xD;
arbor to greet her. Ida, however crossed&#xD;
his path, and diverted his attention from&#xD;
the object he had in view His eager-&#xD;
ness to speak to Mary excited her jea-&#xD;
lousy,. and confirmed her in what Arling-&#xD;
Ston had led her to believe, in regard to&#xD;
his criminality with the young wife.-&#xD;
He broke away from her as gently as he&#xD;
could, but she deemed the repulse as a&#xD;
wilful insult to her personal charms.&#xD;
'This led her to devise some speedy re-&#xD;
venge upon him. She .did not doubt&#xD;
that he would repair to the arbor to meet&#xD;
' her cousin Mary, but she did not know&#xD;
anything about' the note that Ar-&#xD;
lington had sent Walsingham, and which&#xD;
the latter subsequently placed on the&#xD;
-dressing table in his wife s chamber.-&#xD;
She intended when she wrote the letter&#xD;
for Arlington, to receive Thornton her-&#xD;
self at the midnight hour, and entrap&#xD;
him into a dalliance of love, but now she&#xD;
.resolved to meet him, and, instead of ac-&#xD;

hate, and she resolved to stab the young'&#xD;

"Even so, Margery. And now we&#xD;
are coming to the point. Arlington was&#xD;
more particularly anxique that Harvey&#xD;
Walsingham and Ida Walton should"/b,&#xD;
put out of the way, at all'events, and did&#xD;
not care if the lives of Mary and Thorn-&#xD;
ton should also be sacrificed through the&#xD;
complexity of his strategem. He rightly&#xD;
conjectured that Walsinghanm would lie&#xD;
in waiting for there meeting of his wife&#xD;
and Thornton, in the arbor, and, so disq&#xD;
covering fthem, that he would rush in&#xD;
and slay them in their apparent criminal&#xD;
conversation."&#xD;
" Oh, how dark and horrible was that.&#xD;
plot, Armand !"&#xD;
" Truly, it was; but you have not&#xD;
heard how it terminated. Arlington&#xD;
knew well enough -that Walsinghamn&#xD;
would place the note purporting to come&#xD;
from Thornton in the way oft Mary, bt -&#xD;
he did not suppose for an instant thit&#xD;
Walsingham's pure wife would keep&#xD;
such appointment with Thorniton. He,&#xD;
however, calculated that Ida Waltoz&#xD;
would be there in the arbor at the ap-&#xD;
pointed time, disguised in Mary's cloth-&#xD;
ing, and that she would throw herself&#xD;
into Thornton's arms before he would be&#xD;
.able to comprehend the strategem."&#xD;
" And did it fall out as Arlington&#xD;
imagined it would ?"&#xD;
"Precisely to the very letter."&#xD;
" Most extraordinary, indee'd."&#xD;

of her cousin, and waited the coming of&#xD;

The news of the murder of Colonel&#xD;
Burrell soon became spread over the city,&#xD;
and tl~,e arrest of George Dawson, and&#xD;
his explanation of the affair, caused an&#xD;
intense excitement among the pcople.-&#xD;
This feeling was further increased, when&#xD;
Ninny Dawson suddenly returned to her&#xD;
home and learned of the troubles and&#xD;
horrors that had arisen on account of her&#xD;
abduction and mysterious disappearance.&#xD;
She detailed to the 'old gardener and&#xD;
their friend Switzer, all that had trans-&#xD;
pWed in connection with herself since&#xD;
her absence. Then accompanied by her&#xD;
guardian parent, and friend, made the&#xD;
necessary affidavit for the arrest of Ar-&#xD;
lington and his accomplices.&#xD;
The police, accordingly, promptly re-&#xD;
paired to the merchant's house, but find-&#xD;
ing it tenantless, made a forcible entry&#xD;
and searched it from the attic to the&#xD;
vaults.. They found it thoroughly ra -&#xD;
sacked as if burglars had been at wor&#xD;
and carried off everything of portable&#xD;
value. In the dark, damp vaults' they&#xD;
found the murdered remains of Black&#xD;
Rolf, with the flesh already eaten off the&#xD;
bones by rats; and on further research&#xD;
in the wine cellar, there was discovered&#xD;
a large hole in the wall, which led to a&#xD;
culvert or water-course in the street. On&#xD;
pursuing this, they found another~ avenue&#xD;
which led through a similar passage into&#xD;
the cellar of Burrell's house, situated&#xD;
several blocks away from Arlington's&#xD;
mansion. The police had already found&#xD;
that Burrell's house had beenpillaged in&#xD;
a similar manner to the dwelling of Ar-&#xD;
lington, while the dead bodies of the&#xD;
libertine lawyer and Wilkins added to&#xD;
the general horror of the scene.&#xD;

Butler and Armand were found in bed&#xD;
at the house of the Innkeeper, utterly,&#xD;
unconscious-~of all the tragic horrors of&#xD;
the night. They were the two nt~n who&#xD;
acted as resurreetionists and recovered&#xD;
