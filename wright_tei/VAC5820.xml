            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IN the city of Philadelphia, and during the forepart of the year 1844, I accidentally made the acquaintance of an old man named Joseph Secor. He was a strange, but yet a kindly being. His intimates, and they numbered but very few, were unacquainted with his real name; and I only learned it after our chance acquaintance had ripened into a more lasting friendship. If some one, more inquisitive than his fellows, chanced to raise such an inquiry, the old man with a quiet smile would exclaim—"why, what's the difference?—call me Uncle Joseph—that will do." And there the matter ended.</p>
            <p>He seemed desirous of shunning all unnecessary observation, and yet was never discourteous, or rude, or unkind, or ungenerous. He appeared only to seek retirement, and in doing so he did not, by any means, act suspiciously. He was old, and yet not so old as feeble; he was poor, and yet he was content; or if he was not he seemed so. Somehow I pitied the old man's loneliness, and having grown into his good opinion from the beginning, I was frequently in his<pb n="2-3" xml:id="VAC5820-00000003"/> company. It was but very few that he would admit into his privacy, and I soon became the most favored of all. Association with him soon convinced me that he was educated, well informed, deeply read, and possessed of a most close and tenacious memory. During our interviews he was generally cheerful, occasionally thoughtful, but never morbid. He lived in the upper part of a, small house in the western outskirts of the city; and after our casual acquaintance had become confirmed I usually walked out there two or three times a week. I liked to hear him talk, his mind was so extensively stored with interesting facts, and entertaining reminiscences.</p>
            <p>For himself he seldom went abroad, and when he did it was not far. One of the windows of his room overlooked the gardens of several large dwellings which stood on an opposite street; and there the old man generally sat and dreamed away his unoccupied hours. He lived solitary and alone; his little room was kept in order, and his meals cooked by the family that occupied the lower part of the house. Sometimes one—sometimes another of his few friends would gladden his old heart with some trifling present, which they fancied he needed, or imagined would gratify him. In return he never said more than "thank you;" but the tone of his voice was sufficient to prove the words not idle. As I have said, I was his most frequent visitor; and the old man seemed pleased with the attention I paid him. In exchange he entertained me with the fruits of his long experience, and close observation. I was well repaid.</p>
            <p>It was in 1844, it will be remembered, that the terrible and bloody riot between the American Protestants and Irish Catholics occurred in Philadelphia; and it was shortly after that eventful and exciting period that I happened to make the acquaintance of this isolated old man; how, precisely, is immaterial to the development of my narrative. I soon noticed that the old man was laboring under some unusual nervous excitement, the secret of which he finally related to me himself. Had I known then all that he afterwards disclosed to me, I should very reasonably have argued that the nature of the scenes which had just passed must necessarily have exercised a powerful influence over the condition of his mind.</p>
            <p>Naturally enough, for a long period afterward, our conversation would almost unconsciously turn upon that one engrossing subject. Together we canvassed over and over all the incidents from the beginning to the end, commencing with the meeting of free Americans—its material and purpose—continuing on to the unprovoked and murderous attack which the Irish Catholics made upon the citizens—the sudden and wilful shooting down of several unoffending persons—the retaliation of the Americans—the destruction of the Irish quarters, and the burning of the Nunnery, and St. Michael's Church—the conflagration of St. Augustine's<pb n="4-5" xml:id="VAC5820-00000004"/> —the fortifying of St. Mary's by the Romanists—the threatened attack upon the building by the infuriated Americans—the charge of the military, and the shooting down of the people;—each and all were severally arraigned at the bar of out opinion. And the old man invariably took bold grounds against the Romish Church; and always lifted up his voice against her iniquities.</p>
            <p>Thus days, and weeks, and months passed away, and midwinter was upon us. The season was intensely and unusually bitter, and by Christmas the river was frozen over with every prospect of remaining so for a very considerable period. Still, however, I continued my visits to the old man—and still, somehow, our conversation would almost unconsciously turn upon the recent riots—upon the rights and immunities of American citizens generally, and upon the high-handed and unwarrantable position which the great mass of Catholic foreigners were fast assuming.</p>
            <p>"It is most unmistakably significant!" he exclaimed one evening, referring to the collision between the Americans and the Irish Catholics. "The wanton attack in the first place, was entirely characteristic of the Romanists; for to oppose them is always to arouse their bitterest hatred. And what they cannot accomplish by precept or example—always in their hands powerful instruments—they assuredly will by either stratagem or open and undisguised violence I speak advisedly for I <emph>know</emph>"—the old man raised his face to mine and emphasized the last word strongly—"the material of the Romish Church. The retaliation by the Americans, so wild, so furious, so destructive, is an everlasting evidence of what may be expected at their hands when once they are thoroughly aroused to action by the iron heel of Romish oppression. Both elements are powerful, and there will be more of it yet—more of it yet. The time is fast ripening; but I shall not behold the fruition, for the lamp of my life burns dimmer and dimmer. I have seen the seed of contention planted, but the blossoming of the tree is for other times and other men."</p>
            <p>The old man had gradually become abstracted, and his last remarks were uttered as if he was entirely oblivious of my presence.</p>
            <p>"Let the day come!" I replied, warmed by his words "And in that hour may this 'mother of Harlots' sink down forever in all her wickedness and shame."</p>
            <p>At the first sound, of my voice the old man started as if suddenly awaked from a dream. Lifting his face again to mine, be continued to watch me, with kindling eye, until I had finished my briefly expressed hope.</p>
            <p>"Amen!" he responded earnestly, and his voice grew deep and full. "Amen; for the day is dark and the night is filled with crime where ever she abides. Her presence blasts and destroys all that is good—all that is noble—all that makes life honorable or happy. Free thought—free<pb n="6-7" xml:id="VAC5820-00000005"/> principle—free life, cannot exist within the circle of her influence. For her pleasure, men, and women, and children, are transformed into incarnate fiends—for her gratification all law, save her own arbitrary will, is ground into the dust—for her aggrandizement individuals, communities, and nations are pitilessly robbed. She was born in ignorance, and darkness, and crime—cradled in iniquity, and fed with the the warm blood of massacred innocents! What else then can men expect? What from such a creed of blood, and sin, and shame? What from a religion which assumes to hold the keys of heaven, and to stand sentinel over the gates of hell? What? Nothing but misery!—nothing but crime!—nothing but blood!"</p>
            <p>The old man straightened himself up, and spoke with a power and vehemence I had never before seen him exhibit. He was thrillingly eloquent. It was a new phase in his character, for he was usually quiet and practical. I wondered and looked, but did not break the silence which followed his energetic words.</p>
            <p>In a few moments, and almost imperceptibly, his whole form underwent a change. Once again his body bowed, and the fire of his eye went out; and there gathered upon his brow a heavy cloud—a look of agony, of suffering, of sorrow. I felt that some terrible memory was rushing through his brain—some recollection struggling for the liberty of an utterance. And I was correct as the reader will see.</p>
            <p>The struggle in the old man's heart was a stern one, and with a quick, nervous step he paced up and down his little apartment. Let what might be the result of his emotion, I thought it best to allow h s own feelings to decide him, and so continued speechless. Suddenly he stopped in the centre of the room, and turning to me he grasped my hand tightly; not, however, despairingly, but as one who gathers confidence from the clasp of honest friendship.</p>
            <p>"I will speak now! I must tell somebody—I feel it—and better you than many others!" he exclaimed, in a short, agitated whisper. "I cannot contain myself any longer—this concealment is killing me. The truth, terrible and hateful as it is in this case, must be told. The threads of my life are cracking fast, and I cannot, cannot die with such weight upon my heart."</p>
            <p>I gazed at him curiously. His conduct and his words were at once singular and unusual—entirely at variance with his generally quiet and unobtrusive manner.</p>
            <p>"Bend low,"—said he, without noticing my look of astonishment—"bend low, so that even the walls may not hear what I say to you. We have talked of Romish bigotry, cruelty and deception, and of priestly enormities, until your young blood has grown hot with anger and indignation, and your soul has revolted at the things which your imagination has pictured. And yet you did not think—how could you?<pb n="8-9" xml:id="VAC5820-00000006"/> —that, I had ever been a Papist—more, a priest—an artful, cunning, wicked priest."</p>
            <p>"No, it cannot be!" I replied, beginning to doubt my companion's sanity. "You jest or—know not what you say!"</p>
            <p>"I do <emph>not</emph> jest!" he exclaimed energetically. "I was never more in earnest—never better appreciated my words!"</p>
            <p>"You, a Romanist!—a priest! One of that class who have always rendered themselves obnoxious to every principle of honesty or honor? Who have been the great purveyors of crime from the very extreme of ages?" I exclaimed, incredulously.</p>
            <p>"Yes, yes; I have been such, and, I tell it to you now with shame and horror—now that the vail of darkness has been lifted from my soul, and the light of a true faith has rent the thick pall of bigotry, superstition, and crime. But even yet, sometimes, though years have passed away, and I have struggled hard to atone for my sins, a memory of other days, so black, so terrible, so crushing, fits through my aching brain that I feel as if I should go mad, stark mad, with the thought of it."</p>
            <p>"I <emph>can not</emph> believe what you tell me!" I once more exclaimed, bewildered by his strange words and excited manner.</p>
            <p>"Cannot? Right! It would be, a greater wonder if you could. Sometimes"—and the old man's look became vacant—"sometimes I can scarcely believe it myself. And yet it is so—memory, mysterious memory forbids me thinking otherwise. Would I could! Would, O would the past were but an idle fancy of my weakening brain."</p>
            <p>"And even yet I can scarcely credit your singular acknowledgment!" I continued, more and more astonished. "Still I am inclined to think that you but jest."</p>
            <p>"Jest!"—exclaimed the old man, elevating his voice, and speaking with a sternness which I had hitherto deemed foreign to his nature. "Jest? Do my words, or my manner, or my subject, imply that I jest? Would to God that it were but a jest, their could I lie down and die, and not have this fear, this dread at my heart. Jest? It were a sorry jest thus to confess myself so vile and hateful. No, no, young man, I—do—not—jest!"</p>
            <p>I felt the reproach contained in the old man's words, and, exclaimed apologetically;—</p>
            <p>"I would not wound your feelings by a doubt, but that—"</p>
            <p>"I know it—know all you would say—guess what you think," the old man broke in. "I was quick in my words, but there is much at my heart. I get querulous sometimes, and did you know all, you would not much wonder. Much thought, sometimes, makes me unjust. But leave me now, friend, for I am weary in mind and body. Don't think hard that I should bid you go, for I must rest. The secret which I have divulged to you has agitated me; and at the best I am very feeble. Some other time we will talk<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC5820-00000007"/> further upon this subject. I have much to tell you that yet you do not dream of. But leave me now."</p>
            <p>The old man sank down upon a chair, evidently exhausted, and buried his face in his thin white hands. I offered to speak again but he silently beckoned me away. Wonderingly I left the room.</p>
            <p>Twenty-four hours after—about the same time on the following evening—I was suddenly and peremptorily summoned to his bedside. He was sick—sick unto death, it was thought. I hastened to obey the call. I found him much altered even in the little time since we had parted. Death was indeed busy at his life-strings; and I felt that in a brief time the few straining chords which still bound him to this world would be snapped asunder, and his freed soul would fly away upon its mission to eternity. Hourly and momently the gulf narrowed down which separated his spirit from the great mystery beyond the grave—hourly and momently the pains of that second birth became more intense—in a little time the last, great, final agony would be over, and I hoped, whatever were his sins, that the spirit of a repentant man would be born again unto God.</p>
            <p>A dim-light was burning in the little solitary room, and its one single occupant was alone, if indeed men are ever alone. He seemed glad, and doubtless was so, when I arrived; and addressed me kindly, though with a somewhat pre-occupied manner. I walked directly to the bedside, took his attenuated hand in mine, and sat down; after having at his request, arranged the pillows so that he could sit up without much exertion.</p>
            <p>A moment of silence ensued, broken only by the long, low, instinctive death-howl of a neighboring watch-dog. I shuddered at the fearful omen, but the old man remained impassively abstracted.</p>
            <p>At length he raised his head, and pointing with his long, lank finger across the room, he whispered;—</p>
            <p>"Bolt the door!"</p>
            <p>Quietly I complied with what seemed to me a very singular request, and returned again to my seat, I could not, however, avoid a look of astonishment at such an unusual and suspicious proceedings. He seemed to understand my thoughts for he said;—</p>
            <p>"When men talk of murder they should be safe from intrusion!"</p>
            <p>Mingling with the words arose again upon the still air the watch-dog's ominous howl. At the best of times a fearful sound, at that moment it ascended up like a wail of agony from the white lips of the murderer's victim. I started and trembled. The sick man observed my momentary agitation, and catching my hand in his cold grasp he exclaimed;—</p>
            <p>"Nay, do not start!—<emph>you</emph> have nothing to fear! <emph>you</emph> are not guilty of any crime! <emph>you</emph> have not, like me, stood by and heard men's lives plotted away! <emph>you</emph> have not witnessed the<pb n="12-13" xml:id="VAC5820-00000008"/> wanton destruction of unoffending, defenceless, women, as I have!—why then should you start and tremble at the mention of murder?"</p>
            <p>"Merciful Heaven, old man, can <emph>you</emph> have ever been implicated in such fearful doings?" I exclaimed, recoiling from his touch with a feeling of horror. "I would have stacked my life to the contrary had it been necessary."</p>
            <p>My kindly words touched his fast withering heart, and he brushed a tear from his sunken and hollow eye. After another brief period of silence he remarked;—</p>
            <p>"In all men's lives the past has some mystery—with many much crime. Mine is surely not an exception. When first I informed you that I had been a Romish priest, you refused to credit my words—still less will you be likely to believe the apparently wild narrative which I am now about disclosing, if strength is permitted me. And yet, both declarations are eminently true. Long since, however, I cast off the dark superstition, and with both heart and lips, confessed myself to the only true and living God. And now I hate it as once I revered it; and could my curse annihilate the hideous monster, my last breath should pass away in a malediction. But these are worrisome thoughts, and I must check them. I sent for you that I might redeem my word, and relieve my heart. The occurrence I am about relating I had designed communicating to you on the first favorable opportunity; death has but hurried on the confession."</p>
            <p>Here the old man again paused—bade me replenish the fire, and mix for him a stimulant, as he directed. These things complied with, I trimmed the dimly burning lamp, settled myself down as comfortably as the circumstances would permit, and signified my willingness to receive his revelations.</p>
            <p>The thrilling and almost incredible story which I that night listened to will be revealed in the following pages; and improbable as the circumstances may at first appear I cannot, for my own part, doubt the veracity of that poor, old man, standing as he, was upon the very outermost brink of eternity. Why should I doubt?—why should any refuse to believe? Things may appear improbable that are not impossible. And why should any one thing, except indeed it be miraculous, be impossible to so tremendous a combination as the Romish Church?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
               <p>I WAS born in the city of Baltimore, of strictly Catholic parents—by them was religiously educated for the Church, and at an early age became an assistant priest. From that period until I was nearly thirty years old—some ten years—I continued to officiate in that capacity in my native city, never leaving it except for an occasional short visit to some of the more southern cities. I had talent, and might have risen higher, but that somehow I did not feel ambitious of preferment, and so remained in a minor position, During that ten years I saw much—heard much—learned much—but, it was all dark—all sinful. A multitude of crimes, as numerous among the priesthood as the laity, came under my own immediate observation; and though I participated<pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC5820-00000010"/> pated in but little of the deviltry of the former, and none of the latter, as a good Catholic I was compelled to close my eyes to all the wickedness and folly that was transpiring around me; except where it conflicted with the interests of the Church.</p>
               <p>Need I particularize all that I saw and heard? Need I tell of deeds of extortion and robbery? Of how men were quietly murdered, and wronged women, wives, and daughters, mysteriously put out of the way? Need I tell of drunken, dissipated priests, or rehearse the particulars of their frequently obscene and blasphemous carousels? No!—for you have heard many such stories before, and yet can scarcely credit them—scarcely believe that such things can be in this enlightened day, and free Protestant land. But you, and such as you, cannot penetrate into the heart of the Church, and until you can, the deception, and cruelty, and sinfulness of her acts, though told a thousand times over will still be looked upon as too monstrous for belief. But once tear away the vail that conceals the inner sanctuary of her deeds, and you will never more need words to convince you.</p>
               <p>Just previous to my thirtieth birth-day I was peremptorily summoned to this city by order of the Vicar General of M——d, and through the connivance of one Father Huestace, a scheming Jesuit priest. The reason for this somewhat unusual proceeding was not given at the time. It was only my duty to obey, and like a true Catholic, I did. I came. Whether the Vicar General and the Jesuit I were banded together—or whether the latter had imposed upon the former to secure my presence—why I was selected, or what might be the object in view I knew not; nor did I trouble myself to inquire. My orders were explicit, and as I then thought not to be slighted; so in due time I arrived here unknown and unknowing.</p>
               <p>Father Huestace, the Jesuit in question, lived in an old-fashioned house adjoining to, and connected with, the church over which he presided. The church building, like the priest's dwelling, was time-worn, but still remarkably substantial; facing upon the front on a large thoroughfare, and extending back to a small street upon the rear. The dwelling-house could be entered from the thoroughfare on the front by a narrow avenue running along the north side of the church; and from the rear through a grave-yard, which was located on the east side of the church, that was back of it, and on the south side of the house. The rear end of the church on the north side, and<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC5820-00000011"/> the front end of the dwelling-house on the south side, were built up, together for several feet, and through these walls a passage-way had been constructed, by which the priest, who only kept the key of the door, could pass from one building to the other. The edifice and all its surroundings were destroyed by fire during the recent disturbance; but you, doubtless, can remember it well.</p>
               <p>As early as possible after my arrival in this city, I sought an interview with the priest, for so my superior had directed me.</p>
               <p>We met in his library, a room sacred to himself alone. This apartment was in the centre of the building on the first floor. The front room facing towards the public street was used as a general reception room, and those immediately in the rear or on the east side of the library for domestic purposes. The front-door opened into a three-foot hall on the north side, which communicated directly with the rooms in the rear part of the house, and through them the upper stories of the building were reached. The library could not be entered in any other way than through the door opening into the hall, and the one communicating with the church building.</p>
               <p>The somewhat peculiar arrangement of the building ing, and the general massiveness of the walls and partitions rendered it wholly impossible to distinguish any moderate sounds from one room to the other. The library especially seemed designed for secrecy. Under ordinary circumstances its inmates were perfectly secure, as only violent noises could be heard even in the adjoining rooms. That apartment, as you will presently see, was the silent witness to many a deed of injury and crime.</p>
               <p>The only other occupant of the building, besides the priest, was an old and decrepit female attendant who neither saw nor heard anything but as he directed.</p>
               <p>Father Huestace himself was a tall, dark, iron-looking man—one whom only a blind person would have been likely to accuse of much kindness, much pity, or much generosity. And yet to the superficial observer he might have <emph>seemed</emph> to possess all these qualities, and more, while in reality not one such emotion ever swayed his stony heart. In his soul he was, in fact, an unqualified villain. <emph>That</emph> I knew not then, you may be sure; for like the rest, I bent to the influence of his presence. But I had reason afterwards to know his true character, and I will tell you now, what it was. He could rob the orphan<pb n="20-21" xml:id="VAC5820-00000012"/> without one remorseful pang—pick his friend's pocket with a smile—ravish female virtue unscrupulously, and with a depth of rascality and hypocrisy unparalleled, plan a murder, and then say a <foreign xml:lang="LAT">requium</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="LAT">de profundus</foreign> for the poor wretch he had been the means of destroying. To him might well have been applied the words of Shakespeare:— <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l part="F">—"beware of yonder dog;</l>
                        <l>Look, when he fawns, he bites; and, when he bites,</l>
                        <l>His venom tooth will rankle to the death;</l>
                        <l>Have not to do with him, beware of him;</l>
                        <l>Sin, death and hell have set their marks on him;</l>
                        <l>And all their ministers attend on him;"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon entering the apartment I saluted the priest in the customary manner. He responded quietly and kindly; or at least he seemed to.</p>
               <p>He was dressed at this our first interview in his long, dark, pontifical robes; and though his face was hard and unintellectual, his stature, thus set off, was lofty and commanding. There was in his whole appearance a singular mixture of good and bad; and judging by appearance only it was impossible to tell which really predominated, so strangely were they blended. You would have felt him dangerous, and yet insensibly have been drawn towards him; and you would have known him, deceitful, and yet unconsciously consciously have trusted him. He was a man marked out for a purpose—good or bad as he himself willed it. There was the power to govern apparent in his whole person.</p>
               <p>I had advanced but a couple of paces beyond the door, where I remained standing. After the interchange of greetings a momentary pause ensued. He, probably, was waiting for me to explain my business, and I for him to ask it. At length he broke the silence by remarking;—</p>
               <p>"You look weary, sir; and bear the marks of travel on your person. Have you business with me and whence come you?"</p>
               <p>"To your first question, your reverence, if you are Father Huestace as I take it, Yes!" I responded. "To your last, from Baltimore direct. This letter from the Vicar General," and I drew the missive from my pocket, and placed it in his hand—"will doubtless explain all."</p>
               <p>"Ah!" he exclaimed, glancing rapidly over my person, while at the same moment his fingers were busy with the letter. "So!" he continued, smoothing out the paper preparatory to making himself acquainted with its contents. "Be seated, sir, be seated!" he still went on, waving; me to a chair, without lifting his head.</p>
               <pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC5820-00000013"/>
               <p>After at careful perusal of the document he muttered a gratified "humph!" and re-folding the paper, placed it in a massive book-case, that occupied nearly the whole of one end of the room.</p>
               <p>"Your name is Joseph Secor!" he exclaimed, as he turned away from the book-case, and directed the glance of his black piercing eyes full upon me. "I have been expecting your arrival, as you, doubtless, well know. At this moment, however, I cannot explain why <emph>we</emph>"—and he emphasized the last word, unquestionably to lead me to think, whether it were so or not, that others were associated with himself in the business in view—"have sent for you here. I am about to enter the church and perform a peculiar ceremony the excommunication of an apostate—and must therefore defer all communications until this evening, at which time you will find me here. It were best, too, for certain reasons, which will hereafter appear, that you should be present on this occasion, so long as you are here; but only as one of the audience; therefore enter with the throng. One word of caution, however. You are here for a particular purpose—one of an expressly secret character, and it is essentially necessary that for the time being you comport yourself only as one of the humblest members of the Holy Church. To one like you, I need add nothing further."</p>
               <p>Turning upon his heel, he opened the door communicating with the church, and the pealing notes of the great organ, mingling with the chorus of many voices, struck solemnly upon my ear.</p>
               <p>"Hark! the services are already begun!" continued the priest. "I must enter the church."</p>
               <p>With an humble obeisance I quitted the apartment; and the priest, with a precaution, seldom at fault, locked the door of his little sanctum, previous to entering the sacred edifice.</p>
               <p>Passing along the avenue I soon emerged into the front street. Some few persons were still making their way into the church. Notwithstanding the biting atmosphere, for it was winter, and the season had opened very sharply, I paused to reflect upon the strange position in which I so suddenly found myself. Even bound to my religion as I then was, I yet experienced a feeling of repugnance towards Father Huestace. Something in his manner made me feel peculiarly. Nor did I half like my secret mission, though such a thought as disobeying my superiors never once, at that moment, entered my mind.</p>
               <pb n="24-25" xml:id="VAC5820-00000014"/>
               <p>I could not but feel that Father Huestace was powerful—powerful in his position, age, and experience—powerful in the sternness and acuteness of his character, and the determination which was apparent in every word he uttered. That he was a man of fierce parts, and violent temperament, no one could doubt, who looked upon the deep furrows which ploughed his dark brow. That too, he arrogated to himself the mastership of those beneath him, was clearly evident in his commanding tones, and <choice>
                     <sic>imperitive</sic>
                     <corr>imperative</corr>
                  </choice> manners. He was a man, in every capacity, to be feared, as events proved.</p>
               <p>I was suddenly startled from these reflections by the close proximity of two gentlemen, who brushed against me as they passed. When but a few steps in advance of me, one whispered to the other;—</p>
               <p>"I am afraid we shall be too late, Charley!"</p>
               <p>"I hope not, Frank!" responded the other. "I should very much like to witness their mummery, Besides Madelon—"</p>
               <p>"Madelon! What of her, Charley?" exclaimed the one who had been addressed as Frank.</p>
               <p>"Nothing; only she is curious to have an account of the ceremony," responded the other.</p>
               <p>"By-the-bye, you have not yet told me how she bears this business; and I have not seen her, as you know, since the fact became public," said Frank.</p>
               <p>"Bear it!" ejaculated the other. "Like an honest and brave Christian lady, as she is. She does not fear, but only pities, the presumption that can dictates such course. Blest with heaven's approving smile, she can defy all human curses."</p>
               <p>At this stage of the conversation the two young men entered the church. I had followed them—with no definite object however—and entered the building close behind them. The conversation I had overheard was a blank to me, at that time at least; consequently I did not feel particularly interested in their discourse, further than that it led me to conclude that the young men were in some wise interested in her who was about incurring the extreme vengeance of the Church of Rome. So far it attracted my momentary attention; just as it would have arrested you or anyone else.</p>
               <p>Within the church was a dense mass of people, crowding every available spot from the altar to the door. Mingling together, were old and young—rich and poor—vicious and virtuous—curious and indifferent. Many could not obtain seats at all, and were, consequently, crowded together in the vestibule and<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC5820-00000015"/> the aisles. The occasion was an unusual one, and had attracted as well the heretic as the devout believer.</p>
               <p>At the moment of my entrance into the church a deep and painful silence had fallen upon the vast assemblage. Upon the highest platform of the altar, towering up amid burning tapers, and emblazoned images of the crucified Jesus, stood the priest.</p>
               <p>A portion of the ceremony, had been gone through with; and now the priest with uplifted hands was about invoking the awful and impious curse of excommunication. A sudden shudder seemed to pass from one to the other of all that host of people. And then the silence, already intense, grew oppressive; and many fairly gasped for breath. All eyes were intently fixed upon the altar, as if the whole assemblage were fascinated. Suddenly the full, deep, sonorous voice of the priest broke upon the heavy silence; and he cried aloud with startling distinctness;</p>
               <p>"'By authority of God Almighty, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and the undefiled Virgin Mary, mother and patroness of our Saviour; and of all celestial virtues; Angels, Archangels, Thrones, Dominions, Powers, Cherubims and Seraphims; and all the Holy Patriarchs, Prophets, and all the Apostles and Evangelists of the Holy Innocents, who in the sight of the Holy Lamb are worthy to sing the new song of the Holy Martyrs, and Holy Confessors, and of all the Holy Virgins, and of all Saints together with the Holy elect of God; may she, Madelon Hawley, be damned. We excommunicate and anathematize her from the threshold of the Holy Church of God Almighty. Amen!'"</p>
               <p>"Amen! Amen!" responded an hundred voices in one voluminous chorus.</p>
               <p>And then the spell was broken which seemed to have bound the audience; and numbers crowded quickly towards the doors, as if only anxious to get away from a scene so terribly painful, so presumptuously wicked.</p>
               <p>Standing as I did so near one of the doors, I was directly in the path of the out-going crowd;, and, so was borne along, whether desirable, or otherwise, with the current. I offered no resistance, however, and consequently in a very few minutes found myself outside the door.</p>
               <p>Strange as it may appear I again encountered the young men whom I had met upon entering. Some evil power appeared to throw me in their way. They seemed deeply affected by the ceremony which they bad partly witnessed, and the ruddy red of their<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC5820-00000016"/> fine faces had given place to an unnatural paleness. As I passed them, one said to the other;</p>
               <p>"What think you, Frank? Could anything more awful be well imagined?"</p>
               <p>"No!" responded the other. "Satan himself could not have concocted a greater piece of blasphemy. And yet such things are tolerated in a Christian community, and by Christian people. It is a wonder that God does not visibly demonstrate his abhorrence of such arrogant impiety."</p>
               <p>Here the crowd separated us, and I lost the remainder of their conversation. I looked for them a few moments after, but they were no where to be seen.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>SOME few hours subsequent, and Father Huestace again admitted me within the sacred precincts of his library. After securing the door he directed me to a seat upon one side of a heavy table, which stood in the centre of the room. He then seated himself opposite me upon, the other side. A swinging lamp overhead cast a dim-light upon our faces, and the table between us. Once again he fixed his keen black eyes upon me, and this time as if he would penetrate into my very soul.</p>
               <p>I have often wondered since, whether he did not recognize something in my face or appearance—or at least imagine that he did—which created in him an undefined doubt—a kind of presentiment that evil would spring up between us. However, after carefully scrutinizing me for several moments he<pb n="30-31" xml:id="VAC5820-00000017"/> appeared to gather confidence, and proceeded to communicate to me the substance of that business, for the more certain transaction of which my presence had been invoked. Few preliminaries were had. We did not need them. I felt that I was there to obey the will of the man before me, and was then prepared to do so. He, too, knew the same, and what more was needed? Resting both arms upon the edge of the table, he said:—</p>
               <p>"About sixteen years since, Robert Hawley, a good Catholic, died in this city of ant epidemical fever, leaving his daughter, an only child, then about six years of age, the sole heiress of a most princely estate."</p>
               <p>"She that was excommunicated to-day!" I observed, casting an inquiring glance at the priest.</p>
               <p>"The same!" he replied. "We could no longer bear with her open heresy. But to continue. In consequence of the child's extreme youth, her religious preferences and inclinations were not very deeply engrafted; and thus through her incompetency to judge of what was right and proper, some Protestant relatives managed to obtain possession of her person before we were aware of any such intention. A triumph, you, doubtless, think, for the meddling heretics. It was, and the Church hereabouts, felt it. Well, we peaceably claimed the child, and we denied—asserted our rights, and were mocked—threatened—maledictions!—and were laughed at. All this, you will admit, was enough to arouse the indignant zeal of those who, like myself, were interested in securing the benefit, and prosperity, and in maintaining the supremacy of our dear Mother, the true and Holy Church. In that hour, Joseph, I solemnly pledged myself to defeat these heretical meddlers at all hazards. The affair was entrusted to me. For sixteen years I have sought to obtain possession of this girl; and for sixteen years, strange as it may seem, have all my plots been successfully defeated by these accursed Protestants. Such a thing is unparalleled, in the history of the Church, and I blush at my ill-success.</p>
               <p>"Now, the girl has completed the measure of her apostacy, by publicly and openly renouncing the faith of her ancestors, and associating herself with a Protestant community. We have hitherto sought to believe, if possible, that she was held in restraint; but this act of voluntary heresy has dissipated every such delusion, though not the hope<pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC5820-00000018"/> that she may yet see her folly, and seek again the bosom she has stung."</p>
               <p>The priest's words had grown hopefully soft.</p>
               <p>"She is also, it is whispered, about to marry a Protestant husband. O, but we do owe these heretics much! It is to prevent the complete loss of this girl, and to save her immense fortune from some day passing into the hands of these natural enemies of our Church, that I have solicited your services. I did this for two reasons. First, because you were unknown in this city; and secondly, because you must necessarily feel interested in a successful issue to the affair. As an humble citizen, and a Protestant, you can serve the Church largely. I <emph>dare</emph> not trust one who lives here any longer—these heretics are too lynx-eyed."</p>
               <p>Here the priest paused, as if expecting me to say something; but not perceiving any such intention upon my part, he resumed his communication.</p>
               <p>"The estate—should Madelon die without issue—is left for the sole benefit of the Church. To prevent her marriage must then be one of our principal objects. Strange as it may appear, upon that score, she has hitherto given us no trouble. But the character of events is now undergoing a change, and we are likely soon to have another foe to encounter—who, however, I have as yet been entirely unable to discover. The heretics are suspicious, and keep his name as profoundly secret as the grave. Sometimes I have almost been led to doubt the existence of a marriage project—and yet my informer is reliable. But if it is so, we must be beforehand. If she marries, our chance becomes desperate. To obtain possession of her person is then our principal object—if defeated in that, we must at least prevent the marriage, if one is contemplated. And above all, we must find out, who this lover is—this heretic, who doubtless congratulates himself upon his success in robbing the Church at once of her servant and her just inheritance. He must be known to us, and then carefully watched, Joseph. Should he attempt to bite, we must muzzle him."</p>
               <p>A peculiarly meaning smile flitted across the Jesuit's dark and wrinkled countenance. I could not then, however, interpret it.</p>
               <p>"But we must be very cautious—very quiet—very cat-like, Brother Joseph; for this girl and her heretic friends <emph>feel</emph>, if they do not actually know, that we are plotting. A constant and careful watch is kept<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC5820-00000019"/> over her day and night; and not one, nor a half a dozen only, are enlisted in her cause, but a large and powerful combination of the heretics is enthusiastically arrayed against us. Were it otherwise she had long ere this been far beyond their reach. Under ordinary circumstances I should have found no difficulty; but the excessive caution which these people have exhibited, has been impenetrable. Year after year have all my finest schemes crumbled away before the superior cunning of these quick and far-seeing heretics; and I have grown gray in this unsuccessful battle for the Church. Mark! I do not grumble, except at my ill-success. It is a pleasure to me even to annoy the heretics; for I <emph>hate</emph> them all, and am sworn in the presence of Almighty God, the blessed Virgin Mary, and all the saints and hosts of heaven to lend my aid and do my utmost in whatever country I shall be, to extirpate the heretical Protestant doctrine, and to destroy all their pretended powers, regal or otherwise.'"</p>
               <p>The priest's increasing passion entirely carried him away. It was but for a moment, however; when he next addressed me all traces of it had vanished.</p>
               <p>His last words, which were but an embodiment of the Jesuit's oath, left no doubt on my mind— I had previously but conjectured—as to his position in the Church.</p>
               <p>"I can bear this humiliation no longer, Joseph!"—continued the priest after a pause. "We <emph>must</emph> have the girl. They have already triumphed too long—too long. In any other than this land of freedom their temerity had long since cost them their lives; but here the Church is not yet omniscient, though it daily spreads and gains greater strength—here there are laws beyond our influence—laws that will effect us as quickly, and as thoroughly, as the commonest vagrant in the land. Therefore what is done must be done cautiously; and without bungling; and so secretly that the accursed heretics may never be able to discover the means that we employ. This is what lies before us. We understand each other, I presume?" he inquired in conclusion.</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly!" I replied. "Your reverence is too explicit to admit of any misapprehension."</p>
               <p>"It is needless then to prolong our present conference. We have an intricate game to play; one that will require consummate address to carry us successfully through. It is cunning opposed to cunning—scheme opposed to scheme; and but one trick<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC5820-00000020"/> lost endangers the game. We are but two, but our resources are inexhaustible. With your help, my good Joseph,—for I have heard of your ability—I feel confident of achieving a flattering triumph. And in that hour your merit shall not be overlooked. I have influence, and can advance you in the good opinion of those, whose good will is worth possessing."</p>
               <p>Little did the priest imagine how indifferent I was to such a bribe. He fancied me like the rest, calculating and ambitious. But I was not so. I had entered upon the discharge of the business on which I had been directed—whatever it might be—from the same principle which had always actuated my conduct in everything pertaining to the Church—a sense of duty. And if that duty was not always according to honesty or honor, I saw it not so. My eyes were yet to be opened.</p>
               <p>"And now, Joseph, your hand!" he continued, rising from the table; "your hand!"</p>
               <p>Without speaking I extended my right arm. The Jesuit clasped my hand firmly, and pointing to a crucifix, he said;—</p>
               <p>"For the Holy Church, and Christ's Vicar General upon earth. May we prove ourselves worthy the Master in whom we trust, and great shall be our reward."</p>
               <p>I knew not then how deep was that man's hypocrisy.</p>
               <p>I turned to depart, deeming our interview over; but the voice of the Jesuit arrested my feet.</p>
               <p>"A moment longer, Joseph!" he exclaimed, turning towards the massive book-case; "we cannot part, after our first meeting, at least, so unsociably." A generous smile spread over his hard features, and his voice mellowed down into the kindliest tone. "We must drink success to our common cause, and confusion to all renegades and heretics."</p>
               <p>As he uttered the last word he reached down from a corner of one of the upper shelves, a small black bottle, and placed it before me.</p>
               <p>"Drink!" said he pleasantly; "and remember our sentiment."</p>
               <p>I was not accustomed to drinking, and when I did indulge, which was not often, it overpowered me quickly. On this occasion, however, but from what cause I cannot imagine, I placed the bottle to my lips, and took a long draught. The Jesuit followed me, but drank sparingly. He was not an<pb n="38-39" xml:id="VAC5820-00000021"/> intemperate man, as far too many of our cloth were, and are, and doubtless, always will be.</p>
               <p>The Romish priesthood generally, have, from time immemorial, been notoriously eminent for three things—a love of eating, of drinking, and of pretty women. And the great world little knows to what an extent these appetites are indulged. People may conjecture, and conjecture the worst; but even then the reality, could they penetrate beneath the surface, would astonish and horrify them. I have seen hundreds in whom the gratification of the sensual absorbed every feeling of honesty, honor, and religion; who were but one remove, and that only in the outward form, above the beasts of the field.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>FOR several days after my arrival here, and subsequent to my interview with the Jesuit, which I have just described, I was occupied in obtaining a better knowledge of localities. My perceptions in many respects being quick, I soon became familiar with the streets, and so forth. During this period I was, of course, in constant communication with Father Huestace.</p>
               <p>After advising me particularly of what he expected at my hands, he proffered many suggestions as to my future line of conduct; but still left me at liberty to adopt what measures I saw fit, so long as they were likely to further the object in view. I was only to watch Madelon Hawley, and her friends—learn what was being said and done, and discover, if possible, some opportunity to trapan the<pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC5820-00000022"/> former. How I accomplished this was immaterial to the priest. With this assurance I set my wits to work.</p>
               <p>At that time my mind was so powerfully imbued with the infallible Oneness of the Church, that every act perpetrated in her name, in my eyes, assumed the character of a right. There was no Church but the Catholic Church—no God but her God—no atoning power but what emanated from her heart. So I thought. Do not misunderstand me. I was not ignorant, but blind; my mental vision was obscured; and only when the Great Oculist touched my eyes could I behold my delusion.</p>
               <p>But to proceed. From Father Huestace I understood that Madelon was residing, at that time, with her widowed aunt, a Protestant lady, who had married into the family, and one of those who had been mainly instrumental in securing the person of the child at her father's death. She was a strong, shrewd, determined woman. This, you will remember, was in the early part of the winter. During the summer season Madelon usually resided with some other portion of the family in the country. The city aunt, like her relatives generally—for it was a wealthy family throughout—was independent; and consequently ly lived in a costly manner, and in one of the most fashionable quarters of the city. To her residence I finally directed my steps, having first assumed a dress adapted to the part I contemplated playing.</p>
               <p>I understood the position of matters well enough to know that the best, and almost only chance to obtain information, or be of service, was to get into the house, if possible; for to the general eye everything was well guarded. From the moment of her father's death the girl had been watched and protected with a vigilance, that only an intense fear of violence and wrong could have engendered. At home she was never suffered to be alone with any person, unless well known; and when she went abroad—to the theatre, the concert-room, the ball, or the promenade, she was invariably accompanied by either her cousin, the son of the aunt with whom she resided; by his wife, for he was married; by both; or by the aunt herself. In the country the same unflagging <foreign xml:lang="FRA">espionage</foreign> was maintained. The servants had been thoroughly sounded by other emissaries of the crafty priest, but without success. All of them were Catholic-hating Protestants; for Madelon's relatives were far too wary to receive any others into the house; and while some really knew nothing, those who probably did, were much too<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC5820-00000023"/> cunning to be played upon, and too honest to enact the traitor. The neighbors had also been indirectly tampered with; but still the priest had been unable to obtain any information that would assist him in carrying off the girl. Thus was Madelon entrenched; and thus year by year had the priest schemed and schemed in vain.</p>
               <p>It was under such circumstances that I made my first venture in that ocean of dissimulation.</p>
               <p>Mounting the lofty marble steps, I modestly rang the bell. A very pretty young woman, who will appear more prominently hereafter, answered my summons. To her I briefly, and in chosen terms, stated my business. I was an American, I said; and having in vain sought more suitable employment, I was induced to apply for a situation as coachman, for which position I thought myself amply qualified. The times were dull, and business difficult to obtain. The girl heard me through, and seemed interested in my appearance; still she did not think—in fact, she was certain that my application would not be successful. Why she thought so she did not state. Had I any recommendations? Mrs. Hawley always required such assurances of former good conduct. I had not. It was unfortunate; but still she would inform the lady. With that she disappeared.</p>
               <p>It may be well enough to state what induced me to make this application. My object was, of course, admission into the house; and besides the coachmen, few men-servants were employed about private establishments. Under such circumstances I had but little choice. And understanding that Mrs. Hawley generally kept two coachmen, and that recently one had left with the view of settling in the western country, I hoped that my statement, particularly as American coachmen were difficult to obtain, would for once induce her to break through her hitherto undeviating rule.</p>
               <p>In a few moments the girl returned. She was sorry, but Mrs. Hawley never employed a stranger about the premises. She hoped that I would meet with better success elsewhere.</p>
               <p>Not having built much upon my success—though failure in this respect made my path far more difficult—I was very little astonished. To have admitted a strange servant into the house might have been throwing the doors wide open to—death! And they knew it—had ample reasons for knowing it, as I shortly learned. Apologizing for the trouble I had occasioned, I took my leave.</p>
               <pb n="44-45" xml:id="VAC5820-00000024"/>
               <p>That same evening Father Huestace and myself met again in secret conference. A darker frown gathered upon his always dark brow as I related to him my first attempt, and the little success that had crowned my efforts.</p>
               <p>"Maledictions on them!—are they invulnerable?" he exclaimed, and his face suddenly worked with passion.</p>
               <p>"I did not expect much from this!" I replied. "I have, however, another plan to suggest. It is very plain that they will not, by any chance or mistake, admit a foreigner or a Catholic into the house. They fear a plot too much."</p>
               <p>"And—with—reason!" muttered the Jesuit, fixing his dark eyes upon me, and speaking with measured slowness. "Hark you, Joseph! for it is proper that you should know all, so that you may be the better prepared for any emergency that may arise. Shortly after the death of Madelon's father—some twelve months, I think—and while yet my hatred for the accursed heretics who had stolen her was still burning fiercely, an attempt was made by one of the house-servants, an ignorant Irish woman, to poison the child. They were not then so suspicious as afterwards; nor so particular in the selection of their menials. The bungling gling woman, however, performed the job so badly, that the presence of the drug was detected in time to save Madelon's life. You wonder! but at that moment I had the heart to kill them all, whether the act were wise or not. But let that pass. The unfortunate conclusion of the affair placed me in a rather critical position, for the crime was easily fixed upon the girl, and I feared that in her ignorance and fright she might inadvertently implicate me. 'Dead men tell no tales,' Joseph; nor do dead women either. The woman disappeared very suddenly—her whereabouts was never discovered; and though I was suspected by the heretics of being the head and front of the whole transaction, they could not prove anything against me, and so dare not openly accuse me. Since then, however, they <emph>have</emph> feared, and shunned, all foreigners—Catholics especially. For a long period after I remained perfectly passive in the hope of allaying their suspicions. But, you perceive, it has all been in vain."</p>
               <p>"But the woman what became of her?" I inquired with a shudder.</p>
               <p>"Out yonder," said the Jesuit, pointing through a small window into the sombre looking graveyard,—"in an obscure corner is a nameless grave—'tis her's.<pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC5820-00000025"/> The death Madelon escaped, she died; and here too in this very room."</p>
               <p>I glanced over my shoulder nervously, almost expecting to behold the ghost of the murdered woman gazing in at the window. The voice of the priest recalled me. He continued;—</p>
               <p>"To me—her priest—she hastened, wild with fright, for absolution and protection. I gave her both—full forgiveness, and eternal protection—the protection of the grave. Did I not do right?"</p>
               <p>Hardly knowing what I replied, for I was excessively confused, I stammered forth 'Yes.'</p>
               <p>"My safety—my power,"—he still continued—"and the position of the Church demanded her death. With my own hands I administered the potent drug. She did not suspect <emph>me</emph>, and drank it. Five minutes after, her writhings, and torturings, and groanings were over. One whom I could trust buried her out there, before morning. The curtain of night hid us from the eyes of the world, and all went well. There was a wonder at her absence—some little inquiry by the authorities, and the thing was dropped."</p>
               <p>The priest paused; and a silence of several moments brooded over the room. <emph>He</emph> did not seem to be at all disturbed; but my heart beat quick with a great inward dread; for murder is murder, gloss it over as men may.</p>
               <p>"But you were about making a suggestion, Joseph!" he continued, turning the conversation and speaking quite calmly. "Continue!"</p>
               <p>It was only with a strong effort that I resumed my usual manner, and managed to say that I had contemplated seeking employment in some other Protestant family in the immediate neighborhood of Mrs. Hawley's residence; by that means—as it was unquestionably impossible to establish a footing in the house—I should better be enabled to keep watch upon all that was transpiring, and probably succeed in gaining some practical information.</p>
               <p>The Jesuit contracted his brow in thought.</p>
               <p>"It is tedious work," he said; "and yet appears to be the only feasible plan. The law—the accursed law, Joseph, holds us its slaves. Precipitation might fasten us in its meshes; and then would follow exposure and ruin—perhaps worse. Like the mole, we must burrow our way along in the dark. Information we must have, and the clearest way to obtain it is in the manner you suggest. But I fear that even to reach that point you will be compelled to carry a Protestant recommendation in your pocket, for these heretics<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC5820-00000026"/> are daily becoming more suspicious. Some already cry out openly against us, and bid their fellows beware. But the time is not yet ripe, Joseph, and we must not chafe them. We might forge the paper, it is true; but the pen is too frequently a cheat, and betrays to destruction. I'll have none of it. There must be nothing that can rise up against us. To-morrow carry out your suggestion; and if it prove unsuccessful, we must speedily adopt some other plan. The girl <emph>must</emph> be secured."</p>
               <p>The Jesuit's emphatic words and heavy brow suddenly assumed, to me, a more portentous aspect. All that he had not said, my busy brain began to conjecture. He had once by his own confession, attempted the life of this girl, and from private pique more than anything else; might he not, should circumstances arise, do so again? I was willing to lend my assistance in saving Madelon from her heresy, and preventing the Church from being robbed; but I never had, and could not then, make up my mind to the commission of a murder. I resolved to sound him, if that were possible. With that view I propounded an artfully contrived question, in which I hinted at the probable fate of Madelon, when she should be in his charge. The priest seemed to understand what was passing in my mind, and doubtless shaped his answer in accordance. He did not intend her any harm, he said; to that he would be willing, to pledge himself if needful; he but looked forward to the advancement of that faith in the defence of which he had spent his life. It was not Madelon's life he coveted—it was her soul. True, he had once, in a moment of deep disappointment and rage attempted to deprive her of the former; but that was long past, together with the feelings that prompted it. Madelon once in his power would be entirely safe, and should be properly cared for. That he would promise.</p>
               <p>Thus that man heaped lie upon lie, and even blinded me with his well-chosen terms. I did not see how he was gradually subduing me to his purpose—how he was coiling himself around my very being.</p>
               <p>Every interview between the priest and myself developed more fully the hidden springs of his life. Thus, in the one I have just described he confessed, himself a <emph>murderer</emph>, but justified the deed by the exigency of the occasion, and the revelations involved. And though I shuddered at the dark recital, I was not prepared to deny the truth of what he asserted. I still thought—"there is no God but <emph>my</emph> God!"</p>
               <p>The succeeding day I was early abroad. According<pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC5820-00000027"/> to what I had contemplated I applied to nearly every Protestant family residing in the vicinity of Mrs. Hawley's residence, but without meeting with the least success. I offered myself in any capacity—but somehow the chances appeared, for a long while, to be against me. Many were not in want of male-servants, being supplied with all that were necessary; while several who were, could not think of receiving me into their service, without a written recommendation from some reliable person who was acquainted with my character. I began to think the priest's assertion really correct.</p>
               <p>At the eleventh hour, however, I happened upon a hale and rosy old gentleman named Ellis; upon whose pleasant face there rested the light of an everlasting smile, and in whose voice there was the music of a heart all at peace with itself; a man whose life had been spent in doing good, and who believed all men as honest as himself. He had thought of employing a sort of secretary and collector—he liked my unassuming and genteel appearance—pitied the ill-luck that could reduce one so evidently intended for higher purposes, and would employ me, if I liked to accept, upon my own recommendation. The credulous old man played the traitor to himself; but I had gained my object. Of course I accepted, and forthwith was installed in my new position. Little did the good gentleman imagine that he harbored a spy.</p>
               <p>In a very brief period I contrived to make the acquaintance of the upper domestics in the house of Mrs. Hawley—all, with the exception of the butler and coachman, females. My manners were rather pleasing and my condescension—I was Mr. Ellis' secretary, you will remember—properly appreciated; consequently I was not long ingratiating myself into their esteem. With all I assumed to be very free, very unreserved, and very much opposed to the Catholic religion, and Papists generally. That pleased them hugely, for they thoroughly abominated the Romanists.</p>
               <p>I soon grew to be a favorite; particularly with one Winnie, an extremely handsome, and rather intelligent young girl—Madelon's dressing-maid and demi-companion. The same, you will remember, who replied to my summons, when I had the effrontery a few days previous, to apply directly to Mrs. Hawley for employment. Her close attendance upon Madelon made me especially anxious to cultivate her friendship—if possible, her confidence. Women generally are rather weak-minded; and therein I fancied would prove an opening to the citadel. Through the maid I might<pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC5820-00000028"/> some day reach the mistress. With that thought in view I labored hard to secure the girl's good opinion.</p>
               <p>Thus passed several weeks, to all appearance most unprofitably. Father Huestace, in the mean time, was growing more and more impatient—more and more ungovernable in his desire to possess Madelon, and to triumph over those, who had so long triumphed over him. He could scarcely wait for the accomplishment of those details which were absolutely necessary to any degree of success. Cool, cunning, calculating, he yet chafed at a restraint which his own judgment should have taught him was not unreasonable. Much was to be done, on my part—much information, which required a certain coaxing, obtained, before anything could be attempted. And yet the Jesuit, in his selfish eagerness, gave me no credit for the patient perseverance with which I prosecuted my part of the enterprise.</p>
               <p>You will perceive, however, what the Jesuit would not—that much time had necessarily to be expended in making acquaintance—in obtaining a proper footing with those who were likely to subserve my purpose; and in the various other minutiæ which the peculiarity of my object imperiously demanded. To this climax matters had then arrived.</p>
               <p>I see you wonder that I have not spoken of Miss Hawley's personal appearance; feeling, as you doubtless do, that during the time past I must have frequently seen her. My reason is simple. I have felt the task beyond my powers; for her's was a beauty that is almost indescribable. A Hebe in loveliness—an angel in goodness, was Madelon Hawley. What more need I say? Shall I vainly endeavor to portray the shining purity of her complexion; the soft lustre of her great black eyes; the queenly redundance of her raven ringlets, and the voluptuousness of her flowing and graceful form? It would indeed be a vain task, for. Ah! <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Her's was the beauty that though seen but once,</l>
                        <l>Dwells long within the memory, like a strain</l>
                        <l>Of sad sweet music that will linger oft,</l>
                        <l>When the light hand that waked the cord lies low,</l>
                        <l>And moulders in the dust."</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>It is useless to describe how I watched the house which contained the apostate girl—how I lingered day after day around the premises—how I followed Madelon and her friends, on every suitable opportunity—how I finally ventured to tamper with, the domestics; and how, through all, I endeavored to console myself with the poor reflection that the Church had an unbounded right alike to life and<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC5820-00000029"/> limb—to all property in those who cherished her saving grace. I was watchful, vigilant, quick; but still I made no apparent progress, and my master—for the Jesuit had, to all intents and purposes, become my master—began almost to question my ability to assist him. I could see it in his contracted brow, and compressed lips. But I could not manufacture opportunities; and though now well established with the majority of Mrs. Hawley's household, I might as well not have been, for all the definite or useful information that I was able to obtain. I never met with a number of people more united in their secresy—more completely invulnerable. From the mistress in the parlor, to the scullion in the kitchen, they were as a sealed book. These things taken in consideration, Father Huestace had little occasion to reflect on me.</p>
               <p>All Madelon's excursions abroad, as far as I could discover, were invariably made in company with others; and neither gave any clue to what was transpiring, or afforded the slightest opportunity of securing her person. Doubtless they still retained a vivid recollection of the attempt which had, years before, been made upon the life of their charge.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>THE Jesuit and myself, you perceive, were in the habit of meeting daily; the impatient priest being too much on the tenter hooks to remain long unacquainted with my proceedings. The disappointment of sixteen years had made him unnaturally anxious upon this subject. He fancied the long-coveted prize within his grasp, and with difficulty could endure the delay of a few weeks. In one instance at least—the adventure which I am about describing—his impatience, in my opinion, far overleaped his discretion. The ill-success which had so far attended all my efforts to obtain real practical information chafed his hard and passionate spirit almost beyond endurance, and he was not slow in expressing his chagrin. Frequently would he jump up from his seat, as I recounted to him my continued discomfiture, and exclaim bitterly;—</p>
               <pb n="56-57" xml:id="VAC5820-00000030"/>
               <p>"Maledictions! shall this apostate girl, and her heretic allies be forever triumphant? Is the Church become impotent and powerless, or are her enemies mightier than they were, centuries since? Joseph!"—he continued very abruptly, one morning about this time, pausing in his violent tramping up and down the room, and facing me—"Joseph, something must be done—we <emph>must make a venture</emph>. Days and weeks pass away, and yet we accomplish absolutely nothing. We plot, and plot, and yet our plotting never reaches a focus. We <emph>must</emph> make a venture, I say!"</p>
               <p>"I have done all that man could do under the circumstances," I replied. "Environed as we are, aught but the extremest caution would prove our complete destruction. As I tell your reverence I have done my best."</p>
               <p>"Doubtless, my good Joseph, doubtless!" rejoined the crafty Jesuit. "But still I weary at this continued procrastination. Something must be done, forthwith!"</p>
               <p>"But what?" I inquired, satisfied that the priest had some scheme working in his brain.</p>
               <p>"I have been reflecting upon a plan which <emph>may</emph> succeed, and you know, Joseph, we have no real certainty in any one thing that we undertake. Should it fail, if managed properly, it cannot involve us. Listen! You have been long enough in this city to have seen that a great degree of noise and confusion prevails at the scene of a fire. My plan is simply this, and it is more feasible than at a first glance it would appear. We can fire the house in which Madelon resides, and in the consequent confusion we may—there is at least a great chance—secure the girl."</p>
               <p>I looked up at the Jesuit astonished; the utter recklessness of the proposition almost, at first, startling me from my propriety. By dwelling upon the suggestion, however, it gradually became, more familiar—less amazing.</p>
               <p>There was a moment of silence, and we two men sat gazing fixedly at each other.</p>
               <p>"Admit every <emph>chance</emph> there may be;" I at length replied slowly; "who will set the conflagration?"</p>
               <p>"You will, my good Joseph, when once you are convinced that the deed is lawful, and that the Church demands and expects such acts of obedience at your hands!" he rejoined, distinctly and firmly.</p>
               <p>I did not reply; but already my bigotry was beating responsive to what the Jesuit said—already I began to feel it my <emph>duty</emph>. Strange—strange infatuation!</p>
               <p>"Reflect, Joseph, reflect!" he continued, penetrating my hesitation. "We are but executing the obligations<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC5820-00000031"/> which we voluntarily assumed—but fighting the good fight the Holy Church enjoins upon all her children, high and low. This is essentially our duty—one which there is no evading, no tampering with, no putting off. We are authorized and instructed to extirpate the enemies of the Church in whatever land we may be—as well here as in the papal dominions. Besides, no serious damage is likely to result from this attempt—nothing further, at least, than the mere burning of the building and furniture, which a little of their surplus gold will easily and quickly replace. It can be done at such an hour—neither too early nor too late—that the inmates can all safely escape. In fact I should not wish it otherwise. It is not their lives I seek; only the possession of this mis-led girl."</p>
               <p>"But how can it be done?" I again inquired, more than half convinced by the Jesuit's specious arguments.</p>
               <p>"How? my good Joseph," rejoined the Jesuit, lifting his eye-brows with a glance of astonishment. "How? Do <emph>you</emph> ask that simple question? <emph>I</emph> could scarcely have mingled so much with these people as you have, without being familiar enough with the premises to center them at any time. Think it over a few moments, my good Joseph."</p>
               <p>There was another slight pause in our conversation.</p>
               <p>"Well, Joseph!" said the Jesuit, breaking the silence; "what is the result?"</p>
               <p>"I think,"—I began, carried away by the priest's manner and my own convictions; "that the building could be entered through the back way, provided the servants were either out or abed, and the family also retired." My answer, you perceive, implied obedience to his suggestion.</p>
               <p>"That is a risk, Joseph, we must necessarily run;" broke in Father Huestace.</p>
               <p>After a pause I continued, all my scruples, for the moment, vanished;—</p>
               <p>"The yards of these houses, as your reverence well knows, extend to an alley on the rear, and facing the alley are the carriage-houses of the various establishments. I have frequently been in the one attached to the residence of Mrs. Hawley, having become quite a favorite with the coachman, from so heartily admiring his horses and vehicles.</p>
               <p>"The very thing, Joseph!" the Jesuit exclaimed. "Through the carriage-house you can readily penetrate to the mansion. It wants but the effort, I know. Now go your way, and return here early this evening. In the mean time I will work out all the particulars,<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC5820-00000032"/> and provide everything that is necessary for the furtherance of our contemplated adventure."</p>
               <p>This interview occurred during the forenoon of a cold day in the beginning of January.</p>
               <p>With the setting of the sun that same day there sprang up a slight wind. At first it but soughed up and down the streets, and moaned round the corners with a soft wailing sound; but as daylight deepened into darkness its force increased; and as night's black pall settled over the city, it shrieked, and yelled, and tore, with all the wildness and madness of a hurricane. It was an unusual blow, and people looked aghast with terror. The streets were soon deserted, for it was dangerous, from falling objects, to be abroad. Business and pleasure were foregone, and few ventured forth, save upon some compulsory mission. It was a night long to be remembered.</p>
               <p>Notwithstanding the danger and the horror that prevailed everywhere out of doors, some irresistible influence, above and beyond our simple engagement, directed my steps towards the habitation of the Jesuit.</p>
               <p>"Ah, my good Joseph!" he exclaimed, as I entered the library and joined him. "What a night! The wind blows as if it would uproot the very foundations of the earth."</p>
               <p>"A fearful flight!" I responded, as a terrible blast of mind encircled the house, and seemed to shake even its firm walls.</p>
               <p>"Yes, terrible indeed,"—rejoined the Jesuit, drawing close to my side; "but admirable for our purpose, Joseph. Inquisitive people will be compelled to keep within doors. But time flies," he continued, striking the hour upon his jewelled watch; "'tis nine o'clock—by ten we must be in the vicinity of —— Square. The condition of the weather will induce people to seek their beds at an earlier hour than usual. Here, take a glass of this"—the black bottle and a tumbler stood upon the table—"and then to business."</p>
               <p>While I was following his directions concerning the black bottle, the Jesuit knelt down upon the floor, and unlocked a small double, door in the bottom of the book-case. From within he soon extracted a bundle, with which he arose to his feet.</p>
               <p>"Here are disguises!" said he. "It is only now necessary that we should black our hands and faces to pass for veritable woolly heads. On with the toggery, Joseph!"</p>
               <p>In a little time we were completely metamorphosed—changed—transformed into the dingiest black-a-moors. Human eye could scarcely have penetrated our disguise—it was so thorough.</p>
               <pb n="62-63" xml:id="VAC5820-00000033"/>
               <p>"And now, Joseph, for the balance of our equipments," the Jesuit said, again stooping down in front of the book-case. "Here are some combustible materials, which I have prepared, together with some matches, and a bottle of spirits, to help in igniting the fire. Here, too, is an iron wedge, which may be of service in opening an unyielding door. Put them in your pockets you will find them capacious—and then let us on."</p>
               <p>"But should we be detected, what then?" I inquired, with some slight misgivings.</p>
               <p>"But we must <emph>not</emph> be detected, Joseph!" the priest rejoined with confidence. "Think not of such an issue—harbor not such a thought. Now unlock the door—here is the key—and step into the hall."</p>
               <p>I immediately complied with his directions. As soon as I was outside, he proceeded to arrange a small night-lamp and matches upon the table, so as to be ready at hand when he should return; then extinguishing the swinging lamp, and groping his way to the entrance, he soon emerged into the hall, locking the door after him.</p>
               <p>"Come along, Joseph!" he exclaimed, seizing me by the arm, and bending his steps towards the front of the house.</p>
               <p>Once in the street, we hastily wended our way towards —— Square. The wind had subsided somewhat by this time, though it was still blowing roughly. Just as we reached —— Square, the various clocks of the city pealed forth the hour of ten. We passed quickly through the fashionable locality, merely pausing long enough to listen at the windows of Mrs. Hawley's residence, to ascertain if any of the family were still stirring. The absence of any lights betokened that the family had retired.</p>
               <p>"All a-bed, Joseph, but doubtless not asleep,"—whispered Father Huestace. "They cannot have retired long. This way, now."</p>
               <p>The Jesuit still kept the lead. After traversing some two or three squares in a circle, we arrived at the rear of Mrs. Hawley's mansion. We now stood in front of the carriage-house belonging to the premises.</p>
               <p>"Now, Joseph,"—said Father Huestace, "I resign to you. But let your movements be as quick as they must be cautious. Have you reflected? If so, what now do you purpose doing?"</p>
               <p>"Stand close to the wall, your reverence,"—I whispered in reply, "so that I may mount upon your shoulders to the second story windows. It is in that<pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC5820-00000034"/> way that I must get in. I know that they are never locked."</p>
               <p>Suiting the action to the word, I placed the Jesuit with his face close against the wall—mounted upon his broad shoulders—raised the window, and drew myself into the room. Cautioning the priest to remain where he was, so that he might give me warning in case of danger, and assist me in making my exit. I groped my way across the room and descended the steps into the lower apartment. From thence I passed out into the yard; and finally crawled along in the shadow of the walls until I reached the back of the house. Here I paused for awhile to think what next I should do, and to listen whether any one was stirring. All, however, was quiet; no sound disturbed the silence of the night—nothing save the surging of the wind, and the creaking of the window-shutters.</p>
               <p>From the first floor of the portly mansion, which was elevated some five feet above the level of thee ground, projected a balcony. Beneath this, front and back, were small flights of steps leading into the basements and cellars. Down those near which I was standing I quickly descended, and placed my ear to the door—there was no key-hole—to listen. All was silent as the grave. I listened some moments, and then knocked slightly. There was no response—no movement. Withdrawing the iron bar from my pocket, which the Jesuit had wisely provided me with, I placed it between the door and the jam, and soon pried the former open, and with but slight noise. What I did make, if heard, was doubtless attributed to the wind, and thought nothing of.</p>
               <p>Within the apartment, which was a wood cellar, all was still and dark. Beyond was the servants' hall. Quietly I groped my way across the former and at length succeeded in finding the door of communication with the latter. I listened again. All continued painfully still.</p>
               <p>After some further groping around I managed to find the bin which contained the shavings, and other light materials used in manufacturing fires. Quickly scattering the fluid contained in the bottle over these, and placing the other combustible materials I had about me in the best situation for burning, I struck a light, and kindled the fire.</p>
               <p>A moment sufficed to convince me of the impossibility of easily extinguishing the flames; and then I glided from the cellar into the yard, closing the<pb n="66-67" xml:id="VAC5820-00000035"/> door behind me. Noiselessly as a cat I again crept along close to the wall, reaching the carriage-house in safety, and passing up-stairs and out of the window upon the Jesuit's shoulders, without, apparently, creating the least alarm.</p>
               <p>"The word, Joseph, the word?" whispered the priest, anxiously. "Is it done?"</p>
               <p>"Yes!" I muttered, more than half frightened at the incendiary act which I had committed. "Let us get away for awhile."</p>
               <p>With hasty steps we quitted the vicinity, and for some half hour, continued to wander around, anxiously expecting the conflagration.</p>
               <p>At length a lurid light shot up athwart the darkened sky, and arrested our attention. As if each comprehended the other's thoughts, we simultaneously directed our steps towards —— Square.</p>
               <p>The scene which met our gaze was one of unparalleled consternation and confusion. The fire had obtained good head-way, and aided by the high winds, the flames were already spreading with furious rapidity. Vast volumes of thick black smoke, through which shot streaks of livid fire, were belching forth from several windows; while the roaring of the flames, the whistling of the wind, and the shouts of the assembled crowd—for already the street was full of people—rendered the scene at once startling and terrible. Every moment the crowd became denser, and the excitement more intense. Soon the booming of the heavy alarm-bells added to the confusion, and startled the city from its propriety.</p>
               <p>Father Huestace and myself took up a position close to the burning mansion. For several moments we stood intently watching the doomed house.</p>
               <p>"Can they have already escaped from the building?" the priest at length whispered in my ear.</p>
               <p>"I think not," I whispered back. "The fire cannot have been discovered long, and is only now making its way into the front of the house. Look!" I continued as my attention was arrested by the appearance of several females, who were emerging from the front-door, all evidently in a high state of excitement.</p>
               <p>"I see!" said the Jesuit. "Yonder is Madelon; and notwithstanding their evident alarm, they are yet cautious enough to keep the girl surrounded. Maledictions on them!—their presence of mind is astonishing. We cannot reach her now, Joseph; we must watch whither they go, and<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC5820-00000036"/> then decoy her hence. Let us follow. Carefully now."</p>
               <p>Cautiously threading our way through the crowd, we watched the retreating women, until they entered a neighboring mansion, some half dozen doors off. Young Hawley, who accompanied them, then turned and retraced his steps towards the burning house.</p>
               <p>"Now is our time," said the Jesuit. "Mrs. Hawley, and her household, are in such a state of excitement that we shall be able to accomplish what otherwise we could not. My plan is this, and a little spirit will render our trick eminently successful. You shall entice Mrs. Hawley and her daughter-in-law away from the house where they have taken refuge by stating that young Hawley has been severely injured, and conveyed to the adjacent druggist's. The story is probable—such a thing might well be—and they are just in the condition of mind to credit it without questioning. With them out of the way I will find means to entice Madelon into the street; and once, there, circumstances must decide my future course. I have a hack near at hand, and the driver is prepared to act promptly in case of emergency. In the crowd and confusion you can easily lose the two women. Sufficient time has now elapsed to put this scheme in execution. Away now, Joseph, And boldly beard them. I will stand aside and take my cue from the character of your company when you issue forth."</p>
               <p>The priest immediately withdrew a short distance. Summoning up all my audacity, I hastily ran up the steps of the house designated. With a violent ring I brought a servant quickly to the door, and upon inquiring for Mrs. Hawley, in a somewhat loud and excited manner, that lady accompanied by her daughter-in-law, hastened into the hall.</p>
               <p>"What is it?" inquired both ladies, in a breath, and staring wildly at me. "Has anything happened?"</p>
               <p>Their fears assumed the very shape that would deceive themselves.</p>
               <p>I briefly communicated to them my nicely concocted story about the accident which had (not) happened to young Hawley. My earnest manner deceived them; and their sorrow, which they openly, expressed, was dreadful to witness.</p>
               <p>"O, my poor, poor, son!" moaned the almost distracted mother.</p>
               <p>"My dear husband hurt, dying may-be! O, what a terrible night!" almost screamed the agonized wife.</p>
               <p>You may be sure that I could not look upon<pb n="70" xml:id="VAC5820-00000037"/> their grief unmoved; indeed I was almost tempted to declare my story the base fabrication that it was. Would that I had done so! would that I had never again come within the compass of the Jesuit's influence! But I wavered, and finally smothered out the heavenly influence, endeavoring to console my lacerated feelings with the reflection, that they were but heretics, and I had no right to pity them.</p>
               <p>"What has happened?" inquired the lady of the house, anxiously, as she stepped into the hall.</p>
               <p>"My Poor Charles has been injured at the fire!" cried Mrs. Hawley.</p>
               <p>The wife groaned deeply. Her's must indeed have been an aching heart.</p>
               <p>"Can you conduct us to where he is?" she continued, appealing to me.</p>
               <p>I replied in the affirmative, though at first with a slight hesitation. I was still rather undecided.</p>
               <p>"Quick, my dear friend!" she went on, turning excitedly to her hostess: "let our bonnets and cloaks be procured. We will not lose an instant in hastening to the dear boy. Heaven grant that his danger may be exaggerated!"</p>
               <p>The articles demanded by Mrs. Hawley were quickly produced by Winnie, who, it seems had been within<pb n="Illustration-71" xml:id="VAC5820-00000038"/>

                  </figure> hearing, and had hastened for the garments instantly upon their being demanded. At the same moment Madelon also made her appearance, alarm depicted upon every lineament of her fair face.</p>
               <p>"What do I hear, my dear aunt? Is cousin Charles much hurt?" she demanded, anxiously.</p>
               <p>"I fear so, Madelon!" her aunt replied, with a moan.</p>
               <p>"And you are going to him! O, let me accompany you!" she plead.</p>
               <p>If she does, I thought to myself, the priest is again defeated.</p>
               <p>"No, no, it must not be, child! Stay within doors until we return!" Mrs. Hawley replied.</p>
               <p>"Do let me go, aunt!" persisted Madelon.</p>
               <p>"I must not, Madelon!" rejoined her aunt. "There may be danger abroad. Do not urge me more—it will pain me. There"—and she kissed her marble brow—"wait patiently until we return. Come, Alice!" she continued, turning to her daughter-in-law, and seizing her by the hand.</p>
               <p>Together with the three women—for Winnie, doubtless, participating in the unwonted excitement, had hooded and shawled herself, and joined Mrs. Hawley and Alice—I descended the marble steps, and led the way towards the scene of conflagration, with difficulty<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC5820-00000039"/> culty, however, elbowing a passage through the dense crowd. As we emerged from the door of the house, I recognized the Jesuit closely watching us.</p>
               <p>We had proceeded slowly and safely to within a trifling distance of Mrs. Hawley's former residence, when my steps were arrested by an exclamation from some one in the crowd, near the burning building.</p>
               <p>"Mother! Alice! whither do you go?" cried the voice.</p>
               <p>"Son! husband!" screamed the women, rushing into the outstretched arms of young Hawley, who at that moment made his appearance.</p>
               <p>I did not tarry to witness the explanation, which I knew must ensue; but turning upon my heel, while they were yet embracing each other, I hastened back in the direction we had come.</p>
               <p>Father Huestace was no where in sight, and my safety forbade me loitering any longer in the neighborhood. Whether successful or otherwise, I concluded that I should find the Jesuit at his residence, and accordingly I directed my steps towards the church. In the hurry we had neglected making any provision as to where we should meet in case we became separated. To the church, however, I took my way.</p>
               <p>In a brief period I was standing in the Jesuit's sanctum. All trace of his disguise now removed, the man of many plots was traversing the apartment with rapid and uneven steps. His brow was troubled, and betokened disappointment. I seated myself unasked—for I was weary—and looked at the priest inquiringly.</p>
               <p>"A failure, Joseph, a failure!" he exclaimed, between his set teeth. "Another move lost; but yet the game is not up. We are headed off, but not beat—not beat! I'll make another venture for the girl, 'ere many suns shall rise and set."</p>
               <p>A pause ensued; and then the priest continued in quite a business-like tone—for at times he could master his passion quickly—</p>
               <p>"All, however is safe; though, doubtless, the whole affair will be laid at the door of the Church. They cannot, however, I fancy, accuse with any certainty; and so long as that is the case, we may laugh at them. This attempted trapanning of the girl, however will act as a stimulant to renewed caution on the part of her friends. That <emph>may</emph> annoy, but still cannot, defeat us. Personally we cannot be accused in this transaction, as nothing occurred, with me at least, to betray our identity. You, Joseph, can, answer for yourself."</p>
               <pb n="74-75" xml:id="VAC5820-00000040"/>
               <p>"Nor with me," I replied. "I had led the women as far as the burning house, when—consternation!—who should cry out to them but young Hawley. The recognition was instantaneous, and I took to my heels."</p>
               <p>"Maledictions! How everything seems to cross our purpose!" muttered the Jesuit, his breast again surging with passion. "The girl seems to be surrounded by a charmed circle, more potent than any the Church could create. At one time to night I fancied that our triumph was certain; but in a single instant my hopes were dashed rudely from their pinnacle. I had succeeded in enticing Madelon into the street, by telling her that her cousin Charles was <emph>mortally</emph> wounded, and under the circumstances her aunt had thought best to require her presence; we had got some distance from the house in a contrary direction to the fire, when from some cause an intuitive sense of danger, probably—she grew uneasy, and finally took alarm. Turning suddenly upon me, she branded me as the hireling of a baser one than myself and demanded the privilege to return to her friends. For a moment I was confounded. But the night was dark—the portion of the street we were in deserted, and my faithful hackman near at hand with his vehicle. Seizing the girl in my arms, I clapped my hand upon her mouth, and hastened towards the carriage, having first signalled the driver to be ready. I had scarcely taken a half dozen steps, when by a powerful effort she contrived to release her mouth, and screamed for help. With a brief expression of disappointment I was about seizing her again, when a blow from an unseen hand felled me to the earth, but did not render me wholly insensible. "O, Frank, Frank!" I heard the girl exclaim; and then, beheld her clasped in the arms of the man, who, unquestionably had just struck me down. Whence he came I know not. While they were thus engaged, I sprang to my feet, and made for the hack. Once in, the arch-fiend himself would scarcely have prevented my escape, much less this Frank. Frank! the name is burnt into my heart!"</p>
               <p>"Frank! Strange, that I should hear that name twice repeated under such peculiar circumstances," I muttered, in a half unconscious musing.</p>
               <p>"What mean you, my good Joseph?" demanded the Jesuit, eagerly. "Know you the ready heretic? Who is he? His name?—his condition?"</p>
               <p>I replied to the priest by repeating the remarks, which I had overheard the two young men give utterance to, on the day of Madelon's excommunication.</p>
               <pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC5820-00000041"/>
               <p>"And one of these young men you have since recognized as Mrs. Hawley's son, while the other you have never again encountered or heard anything of. Strange—strange! We must find out more about this Frank—this audacious heretic, who goes about blaspheming the Holy Church, and knocking people down in the street. Can he be the man rumor says Madelon is soon to wed? It looks like it. If so, I have a double account to settle with him, Joseph; one for the Church, and one for myself. But enough of this for the present. Now, Joseph, divest yourself of that disguise, and then go your way for my head aches and reels from the blow, which that young rascal so unceremoniously dealt me. Strange, if I do not yet be equal with him."</p>
               <p>While, I was changing my apparel, and removing the black stains from my face and hands, the Jesuit continued talking.</p>
               <p>"We shall have need hereafter, Joseph, to be more cautious still," he said; "for this bold and unsuccessful foray will render Madelon's friends argus-eyed. I must reflect upon some other plan, more deeply laid, if possible, and more likely of success; something that will defy all attempts to fathom, and all human efforts to escape. I know not yet what it shall be, but something more must be done. In the mean time, Joseph, continue the strictest <foreign xml:lang="FRA">espionage</foreign>, and lose not an opportunity to obtain all and any information that you can from the house servants. In a few days the family will, doubtless, be re-established in another mansion; and before the expiration of a week, the conflagration will cease to be a marvel. As I remarked before, keep up your communication with the domestics, and neglect not an opportunity to sympathize with them—in that manner you may eventually learn something that will prove of great benefit. Another good opportunity, and I think we could impose upon them more successfully than on the present occasion. At least we must venture. And now, Joseph, a glass of something strong, and then go your way."</p>
               <p>The Jesuit, probably, began to see the error of his impatience, and was inclined to be more reasonable.</p>
               <p>Less than an hour after I passed the scene of the recent conflagration. The wind had almost entirely exhausted its force, and a quiet, strangely in contrast with the noise and confusion which had prevailed a few hours previous, rested upon the scene. The palatial grandeur of the Hawley mansion was entirely obliterated; nothing remained, to mark the spot, but a pile of smouldering ruins.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>TIME hastened on.</p>
               <p>Another week passed away, and I was again embarked in an ocean of plots. Though really, and in heart, an unwilling conspirator, I had not yet the moral courage to burst the chains which the Jesuit had cast around me.</p>
               <p>During the intermediate period—as the priest had predicted—Mrs. Hawley, with her family, had re-moved into another splendid and spacious residence in the immediate neighborhood, which chanced to be vacant at the time. I closely watched all their proceedings, and continued to report myself to Father Huestace. Occasionally I got a chance, to converse with some one of the domestics—once or twice with Winnie—and though I improved the opportunities as much as possible, I made no headway in the right direction.</p>
               <p>In relation to the fire, they expressed much wonder, attributing the daring act to incendiaries, but uttering not a single word that would betray any suspicion as to who had committed the deed, or any knowledge of the attempt which had been made to carry off Madelon. I naturally concluded that the domestics were ignorant of the facts; and whether they were or not, it would certainly be impolitic in me to broach the subject, as my knowledge might then be questioned.</p>
               <p>Of course I felt anxious and fearful—anxious to know what was said, and thought, and fearful that my agency in the outlawed deed might be suspected and charged home to me. For the time being these thoughts and fears induced me to work more willingly—rendered me more desirous to complete the task which was before me—my <emph>duty</emph>, as I continued sedulously repeating to myself. I began to reflect a little, too, upon the position in which our late adventure had placed me. I saw plainly, though I would not then attach any importance to the fact, that the Jesuit had me wholly in his power. This reflection worried me, though I determinedly attributed my feelings to some other cause.</p>
               <p>Several days more fled quickly away, and the impenetrable<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC5820-00000043"/> penetrable barrier which ever surrounded Madelon remained unbroken. The Jesuit was again growing irritable at our inefficiency, as he impatiently termed it; and I myself had begun to think, that some superior power held the girl in especial favor, when I chanced—how you shall soon see—to gather sufficient information, to set all the machinery of our plot—I say "<emph>our</emph>," for at that time I was certainly identified, heart and hand, with the scheming Jesuit—again in active operation.</p>
               <p>And that you may understand exactly what this information was, and how I obtained it—that you may comprehend the crafty deceit, the falsehood, the hypocrisy, by which I attained my end—I shall repeat in full a conversation, which otherwise I should sum up in a few words. While in the street early one evening about that time, I accidentally met Winnie, Madelon's half companion. She had been visiting a sick friend, and was hastening home. I joined her, with my mind made up to pursue a certain course—most dishonorable and culpable one, as I now see it, and have ever since pronounced it. It did not strike me as such, then, however. In fact, in that respect, I gave it no thought. The girl seemed pleased with my company, and that argued well for my success. Pleasure is apt to open the heart. We walked on together, chatting sociably, and every moment becoming more unreserved—upon her part at least, though not really on mine, for every word I uttered, was uttered for a purpose, and was therefore guarded. Winnie was naturally a smart girl, and it required the best of generalling to lead her astray, particularly upon a subject which she, in common with so many others, seemed to have so much at heart. You shall see how I managed her, and to what extent I succeeded in my designs.</p>
               <p>I exerted all my conversational powers, and at that time I was a proficient; and finally so engaged her attention, and absorbed her sympathies, by my well-directed flattery, and insidious hints of things which might be—the girl favored me strongly, to say the least—that she forgot for once her characteristic caution and reserve. The prospect of a husband was too much for her; and in that moment, when her loving heart—for though poor and humble, and held in contempt by many, her bosom beat as warmly and as truly as any of God's creatures—was absorbed in rosy anticipations of the future, she forgot her present discretion.</p>
               <p>With devilish cunning I seized upon, and used, the<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC5820-00000044"/> propitious moment. Gradually—slowly—almost imperceptibly, I turned the conversation upon her mistress; and did it so adroitly—with such nice precision, that, quick-witted as she usually was, she failed to take alarm. All of the domestics had been tampered with, except this girl; for I had hitherto felt a backwardness in approaching her upon the subject. I now depended upon her heart as an ally.</p>
               <p>"Your mistress does not go much abroad?" I at length remarked, in a very indifferent and careless manner.</p>
               <p>"No, not much, Joseph," she answered, without noticing the tendency of my question.</p>
               <p>You perceive that I passed by my own proper name. Under the circumstances I did not think it necessary to adopt any other.</p>
               <p>"It appears to me very unnatural for one so young, and beautiful, and rich, to be moping so much at home," I continued, artfully.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but it is'nt her fault that she don't go more abroad than she does; she doesn't stay at home so much, of her own free will, that you may depend upon, Joseph," the girl retorted impulsively, and consequently, honestly.</p>
               <p>"Ah, that alters the case," I replied, purposely mis-understanding my companion. "I was not aware that your mistress—so young and healthy looking—was suffering from disease. Who—would—have thought it!"</p>
               <p>"Why, how you talk, Joseph!" Winnie exclaimed, with the least show of irritation. "I did'nt say Miss Madelon was sick! Can't anything but sickness restrain a person in the house?"</p>
               <p>I was quick enough to understand that the girl's thoughts were gradually concentrating upon her mistress; and I felt, too, that but one incautious word, would close her lips even to me, her popular favorite.</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, my <emph>dear</emph> Winnie, certainly;"—and I spoke in the kindest tone possible, emphasizing the word "dear" for effect; "but what in the name of wonder can it be? I cannot imagine anything else!"</p>
               <p>"Why, them—<emph>them—THEM—ATROCIOUS</emph> Catholics!" she exclaimed, at length, vainly endeavoring to restrain her tongue, and replying as if I already some had knowledge of Miss Hawley's troubles. The woman had got the upper hand. "There now, I've said it; but thank goodness, it's only to you, Joseph, and I don't think I need fear trusting you."</p>
               <p>Her unsuspecting heart spoke then, and how it deceived her, you may well guess.</p>
               <pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC5820-00000045"/>
               <p>"But I can't understand it all, Joseph," she continued, speaking impatiently and more plainly. "Ain't we in our own country? and isn't it free? Hav'nt we the right to go where we please? do what we please? and say what we please? and as long as we don't do wrong, hav'nt we laws to protect us? It's a burning shame, that it is, that my dear young mistress, with all her wealth and beauty, should be compelled to stay at home, or go abroad in bodily fear, and all owing to these vile and sneaking Romanists!"</p>
               <p>The young girl paused for want of breath to continue.</p>
               <p>"Why, you astonish me, Winnie!" I exclaimed, with well-dissembled surprise. "Can this be possible? But if your mistress really has cause to fear in this manner, why is it that she does not appeal to the laws you refer to?"</p>
               <p>"Because those who are suspected to be wrongfully inclined towards her, are far too cunning to commit an act that would be likely to lead to detection, or afford any proof of their complicity. They know entirely too much for that. Only just let them once, and they will find that in this land at least, jails were made for them as well as others. They take precious good care, though, not to expose themselves; for they are too treacherous and cowardly. They strike only in the dark, and that is what my mistress and her friends fear."</p>
               <p>I winced under the girl's outspoken words, and the beating of my heart seemed to justify their truth.</p>
               <p>"Well, I must say, this is all very strange, Winnie," I continued, with assumed bewilderment. "But who does she fear particularly? not all the Catholics?"</p>
               <p>"No; only the priests, I believe," she whispered in reply, at the same time glancing nervously around.</p>
               <p>"The black hearts, they are always at some mischief!" I exclaimed, earnestly, and with seeming, honesty. "But why does she fear the priests?"</p>
               <p>Winnie grew restless, and did, not reply; acting as though she thought that she had gone too far.</p>
               <p>"Joseph,"—she said at length—"I've already told you more than has ever before been told out of the house. I'm very foolish girl, or I should'nt have said a single word, for the subject is one of great importance to my mistress. To any other, Joseph, I should have been dumb, as I have ever been; but somehow I feel as if I could trust you, even with my life, if it were necessary."</p>
               <p>The girl's preference had unlocked her tongue; it but remained for me to profit by her weakness. Love,<pb n="86-87" xml:id="VAC5820-00000046"/> the all-potent magician, rendered her at once loquacious and confidential.</p>
               <p>"Indeed you can, Winnie!" I replied, earnestly.</p>
               <p>"And there are three good reasons why. Because I like you"—the words went home to her heart—"and in the event of your being unhappy should be so myself; because I have no reason for injuring your mistress, she never having wronged me; and because I am a Protestant, and naturally enough do not love the enemies of Miss Hawley. Three ample reasons, I take it; and three that will satisfy even you, I know. Go on now, and fear not."</p>
               <p>You see, what a base part I was playing, and all for my—<emph>religion</emph>. I, too, can see it now, and in all its naked, irredeemable deformity, though I could not then. The mists of bigotry still enveloped and concealed the true character of my conduct, and blinded me to the thorough despicableness of thus tampering with one who trusted in the better principles of human nature.</p>
               <p>"Well, Joseph, I will trust you,"—she replied;—"but mind, you are the first one, I ever whispered a syllable to, and you must never, <emph>never</emph> repeat it; for if in any manner I was to injure my mistress, it would be to me a source of constant regret; she is so good—so kind—and we all love her so much."</p>
               <p>I promised all that the girl required; and then she went on, nestling close up to me, and lowering her voice to a scarcely audible whisper.</p>
               <p>"You asked me, Joseph, why my mistress feared the priests—the reason is this. Miss Madelon's father, who died when she was a small child, was a Roman Catholic, and a bigoted one, too. What a blessed thing it was, that he did not live long enough to make the poor child one. Better an hundred superstitious fathers should have died, than that Madelon should have been taught to worship a senseless block of wood, or to bow before an unclean priest."</p>
               <p>The girl spoke earnestly, and the bitterness of her words rankled in my soul. What was I but an unclean priest?—a worshipper myself of senseless wood? Still I went on for my—religion.</p>
               <p>"So I say, Winnie," I rejoined, with assumed enthusiasm. "To escape the degrading servitude of the Catholic religion—worse that, it is most generally mental slavery—is indeed an event worthy of our best congratulations. Miss Hawley has need to be grateful—her friends have need to be grateful—we all have need to be grateful, that she by any means—<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC5820-00000047"/> even the death of her father—escaped a destiny so dark—so utterly devoid of that moral independence which enables the true and enlightened Christian to approach so near to the Throne of God."</p>
               <p>"How beautifully you can talk, Joseph!" exclaimed Winnie, admiringly.</p>
               <p>"Well, never mind that, but go on with what you were saying," I responded.</p>
               <p>"Well, as I was saying, Joseph, Miss Madelon's father died when she was very young, leaving the greater portion of his large fortune solely to her with the proviso that in the event of her dying childless, the whole of the estate should go to endow the Catholic Church in this country. Now, did you ever hear of such a thing, Joseph? The blind bigot, to so lay his child open to persecution. That very clause has made her life one of continued anxiety, and may, probably, occasion her death. It is the fear of some diabolical villainy being resorted to for the purpose of securing this money and also of gratifying private hatred—and two base attempts have already been made upon her, one recently"—I felt that the girl referred to the night of the fire, but kept my own counsel—"that makes a slave of my dear young mistress."</p>
               <p>"Her father was but like all of his class," I replied, chiming in with her convictions. "It is only a wonder that the Church did not entirely <choice>
                     <sic>supercede</sic>
                     <corr>supersede</corr>
                  </choice> his child. But still no harm may come of it. Doubtless, your mistress alarms herself needlessly."</p>
               <p>"She does <emph>not</emph>, Joseph!" returned the girl, with spirit. "Havn't I told you that two attempts have already been made upon her; and don't we all know what unscrupulous men these priests are? Why, if they"—the girl still continued dealing in generalities when speaking of Madelon's enemies—"were to murder her, I don't think it would be the first time that they had dipped their hands in human blood. Besides they once <emph>did</emph> try to kill her."</p>
               <p>I now became anxious to find who she meant by "they," if indeed she knew.</p>
               <p>"Kill her!" I exclaimed, echoing her words. "You are jesting, Winnie!"</p>
               <p>"I am not, Joseph!" she replied. "They <emph>did</emph> try to poison her, just after her father's death, and her removal among her Protestant relatives. I've heard Miss Madelon and her aunt frequently speak of it. An Irish servant woman, it seems, attempted to administer the drug, but through nervousness, or drunkenness, or something else, betrayed herself before she had accomplished her fiendish purpose. Had she been<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC5820-00000048"/> a little more herself, Madelon's fortune and orphan condition would soon have proved a curse."</p>
               <p>"You astonish me!" I replied. "And yet it is no more than we should expect; for many of, these Romish priests would think as little of killing a human being as I would it cat. But what came of it, Winnie? The woman, I suppose, was arrested!"</p>
               <p>"Np, she was not," returned the girl. "In the confusion she made her escape, and was never afterwards heard of. Spirited away by the plotting priests, I suppose."</p>
               <p>I thought of the writhing woman in the Jesuit's library—the dark graveyard, and the midnight burial, and my heart, for a moment, beat quickly.</p>
               <p>"And was the author of the attempt never found out, Winnie?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>"Never!" the girl replied, briefly.</p>
               <p>"He was suspected, however," I continued, anxious to lead her on to further developments.</p>
               <p>"Why, yes, he was," the girl replied, at the same time hesitating, as if in doubt whether to proceed any further or to stop.</p>
               <p>"And is most likely the same one who is still suspected of being the secret foe. That is but natural. The villain who would stoop to such a deed, is entirely tirely unscrupulous—is to be feared, and should be watched."</p>
               <p>A great truth I uttered, though it did not then have the weight with me it should have had.</p>
               <p>"I should like to know this man, Winnie—this man who sets on ignorant women to murder innocent children. A knowledge of his name might sometime place me in a position to be of service to your mistress. What was he called?" I continued.</p>
               <p>"I don't know, Joseph; and that's the truth," the girl replied, earnestly.</p>
               <p>"But did you never hear any one in particular named in connection with this singular affair?" I persisted, determined, if possible, to penetrate into the mystery of their thoughts.</p>
               <p>"Well, no, not by name, Joseph, though I have otherwise," rejoined the girl, evasively, "But <emph>indeed</emph> you must not ask me any more."</p>
               <p>"And why, Winnie?" I still persisted, anxious to remove her hesitation, and again unlock her tongue. "Do you think me an old woman, and fancy that I will go gossipping around the city?"</p>
               <p>"O, no, no!" she replied, quickly.</p>
               <p>"Do you then think so meanly of me, as to imagine, that I would wilfully betray the confidence you<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC5820-00000049"/> repose in me? Or do you fear, that <emph>I</emph> am a priest in disguise? For shame, Winnie, for shame," I continued, with a slightly quivering lip;—"I could almost make up my mind to be angry with you."</p>
               <p>"No, Joseph, no—don't be angry," she replied, touchingly, at the same time laying her disengaged hand upon my arm, and looking into my face;—"but these are things which have never before been spoken of outside of the house. They are fearful things too; and I feel that we should not trifle with them. We have all been charged not to; and until the present moment I have never betrayed the confidence which has been reposed in me. But God knows, if I've done wrong, I did'nt mean to. And yet I can't imagine what occasion you would have to betray me, Joseph; besides you seem too good to act so basely—too manly to descend so low. And what could it profit you, even if you were to do me this wrong?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Winnie, nothing; for I have no interest at stake further than sympathy for your really unfortunate mistress," I replied; and then proceeded with a general answer to the whole of her remark. It was delicate ground, and I threaded my way cautiously.</p>
               <p>It would be uninteresting for me to detail all that I said in this connection; all the arguments that I advanced—all the falsehoods I manufactured. They can easily be imagined. My promises, however, were manifold, and of every character. Nay, even offered to invalidate my constancy by an oath, if she required it.</p>
               <p>And what to me, then, would have been an oath, sworn upon the Protestant bible? as the girl, doubtless, interpreted what I said, and as I designed she should. Air! Nothing more. A jest to make merry over. Like the rest of my class would readily have spurned and trampled the heretical book beneath my feet, or have willingly committed it to the devouring flames. Oath, indeed! I would have pledged myself, at that time, upon a stack of such volumes, and never deemed the obligation in the least binding. And in that faith every Catholic is reared—in that faith nine hundred and ninety-nine thousand out of every million live, act, and die. So in one thing, so in every thing. There are no exceptions—the rule is general. Is it to be wondered then, that there is so much superstition, bigotry, and intolerance? Are not such things the natural consequences of such a proscribed and limited education? I think so; and so does<pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC5820-00000050"/> every liberal and enlightened person in the community.</p>
               <p>But I wander. Having exhausted all argument, I resorted to another method. I spoke very kindly and gently to I the girl—mildly explained how little occasion there was for alarm; and finally so allayed her fears and blunted her scruples, that she at length consented to proceed with her story. And all this I managed without seeming over-anxious—without appearing more intimately interested than as a mere matter of curiosity in so wonderful a story. Unquestionably, too, I had an advocate in Winnie's heart.</p>
               <p>"Well, Joseph," continued the girl, at the conclusion of my eloquent, but heartless speech, all her misgivings vanished—"I don't fear with you as I do with the generality of people that one meets every day. I can't tell why, exactly—all I know is, that I don't. From the very first I felt attracted to you—felt just as if I had met an old friend, long absent. Still, I must say, that I didn't think that even you would have so deeply enlisted my confidence. It is strange."</p>
               <p>I did not think it so very strange. Love leads people many queer races.</p>
               <p>"Before we met"—the girl went on—"I would as soon have thought of cutting off my right hand, as of telling one iota of the secrets of the Hawley family; and now I am actually telling you about all I know."</p>
               <p>Another evidence, I thought to myself, of the power of love; and I might have added of the depth of my own deceit.</p>
               <p>"See, what confidence I have reposed in your honor and integrity."</p>
               <p>Honor! Integrity! How oddly, to my ears at this time, sounds honor in such an association. Could the girl have known everything, she would have substituted "deceit" and "treachery," for the flattering terms she so innocently used.</p>
               <p>"And that confidence shall make us yet better friends, Winnie," I replied, looking the feelings I had no desire to more openly express.</p>
               <p>"If that is possible, I hope so," the girl rejoined, as if she did not understand me. "But you were asking, Joseph, whether any particular person was suspected in this affair of Miss Madelon's!"</p>
               <p>"I believe so," I answered, indifferently, or seemed to.</p>
               <p>"Well Joseph, there is!" she exclaimed, looking around, as if to satisfy herself that no one was within hearing.</p>
               <pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC5820-00000051"/>
               <p>This especially interested me, and I bent my ear close down to her face.</p>
               <p>"Who?" I inquired.</p>
               <p>"I cannot name his name, Joseph, for the family, though they frequently speak of his wickedness, his cunning, and his hypocrisy, never refer to him personally."</p>
               <p>I was rather disappointed. Still the name was not essential, though I wished to arrive at the whole of their information.</p>
               <p>"They are probably wise in not doing so," I remarked, anxious, by my approval, to encourage the girl's loquacity. "Under such peculiar circumstances it could do little good, while it might prevent them from finally overreaching their enemy."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes, Joseph; they have no doubt studied all the chances," the girl replied. "They have much to lose, and are therefore proportionably cautious."</p>
               <p>"Have you never, Winnie,"—I inquired—"heard any particular conversation that might throw light upon this singular story?"</p>
               <p>"I have, Joseph," said Winnie. "Sometimes I have heard Miss Madelon speak of a tall, dark, evil looking man—a Jesuit priest—who used to visit her father's house when she was a child, and while yet both her parents were living. Her mother died of consumption about a year before her father was taken away; and though she was a professing Catholic, she was a bright exception to the generality of them. Miss Madelon is said to inherit not only her mother's features, but her kind and gentle disposition. This priest was their confessor, and a most dreadful villain. I have heard Miss Madelon tell—though she is not generally very open with her speech in what relates to her past life—how once she discovered him and her mother alone together—how the priest looked wildly and angry, and <choice>
                     <sic>dissappointed</sic>
                     <corr>disappointed</corr>
                  </choice>; and her mother insulted and indignant; and how, as she suddenly burst into the room, child like, she heard her mother tell him to never again dare to utter such a word in her presence, for if he did she would at once inform her father, and have him exposed. The priest replied not, but quitted the room with an ominous, scowling brow.</p>
               <p>The child could not then understand the meaning of what was said, but the words were nevertheless <choice>
                     <sic>inindelibly</sic>
                     <corr>indelibly</corr>
                  </choice> fixed upon her young mind; and somehow from that time she both feared and disliked the dark priest. As she grew older, and her mind strengthened<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC5820-00000052"/> ened, and when her poor mother was slumbering in the quiet churchyard, she instinctively comprehended what the base priest meant. Thus I have heard her speak—at times with broken voice and tearful eyes—and again with anger and indignation. This is about all I know, Joseph, that is of any importance and yet it is enough, I think, to show, that an unholy avarice, and an undying hatred, have made the mother's tempter the child's enemy."</p>
               <p>"True, Winnie, true!" I replied. "Disappointed passion, and greedy avarice, are the greatest curses of this world. The priest is but one of thousands who have rushed headlong into the troubled waters from which so few escape. This is a singular story you have told me, but, doubtless, true. Where it all will end you nor I cannot tell. Ah, these priests—if all be true that is said of them they have, indeed, much to answer for."</p>
               <p>"That they have, Joseph, that they have!" responded the girl, with quickening words. "And it is but little, I think, that the world really knows of their secrets, and sinful doings."</p>
               <p>Thus far the girl had made but very slight mention of the outrage attempted at the fire. In fact, as you may perceive, she had but indirectly referred to it. The same reasons that influenced my conduct in my interviews with the other domestics prevented me from pushing the subject to an explanation with Winnie. Besides, it was not necessarily important.</p>
               <p>"But this rascally confessor, Winnie," I continued, more anxious to lead her to say something concerning Madelon's lover, if indeed she had one. "Your mistress, I suppose, converses freely of him—that is to her relatives and friends."</p>
               <p>"I have said, No, Joseph," the girl replied. "Sometimes things occur which lead her to mention him; but even then she never does so in the presence of any others than her aunt's family; and, sometimes, though but by chance, myself; and I suppose, though, indeed, I don't know for certain, Mr. Frank ——"</p>
               <p>Frank! thus again for the third time I heard that name, and under unusual circumstances. The singularity of the occurrence caused me to turn round to my companion rather abruptly, and brought us to momentary stop.</p>
               <p>The instant, too, that the name had crossed the girl's lips, she broke off as suddenly as if stricken dumb. That in itself would have been enough to create curiosity in any one. In me it did more. I waited some time for her to continue, but she remained<pb n="100-101" xml:id="VAC5820-00000053"/> ed silent. Thus we walked on a short distance. I affected not to notice her strange conduct—for I saw that she cast several side-long glances at me—and acted with an indifference that might easily have quieted a more astute person than herself. All the while I was busy devising some method to draw her out more fully. At length I addressed her thus;</p>
               <p>"Well, Winnie, what's the matter? why don't you go on? I have been waiting for some time, but you appear to have come to a dead halt. "Frank" was your last word. Who is he, <emph>my dear</emph>, and why is he admitted so deeply into the confidence of Miss Hawley and her relatives? But why ask that? The circumstances explain themselves. A lover, doubtless!"</p>
               <p>I paused, anxious to see the effects of my words.</p>
               <p>"I don't know, and can't tell if I do, so don't ask me any more," the girl replied, hurriedly, as if anxious to get rid of the subject.</p>
               <p>"And why not, Winnie?" I inquired, in a light tone, "Is it a crime for a young, rich, and pretty lady, to have a lover, that you fear to speak about it?"</p>
               <p>"No, not a crime, Joseph; but in this case it might prove a misfortune," answered the girl, her voice slightly trembling. "But on this point I cannot communicate anything, even to you. I have already trusted ed you with a great deal, so don't, now, ask me any more. Keep what I have told you, and let us talk about something else."</p>
               <p>The girl stopped, and appeared to be thinking.</p>
               <p>"Besides, Joseph, I can't see why you should be so inquisitive about Miss Madelon's affairs," she continued. "If I did not know you so well, and trust you so implicitly, I should almost think that you had some object in view."</p>
               <p>I stood upon a precipice; one incautious step and I was over. To arouse the girl's suspicions, I knew, would defeat all, and place me, it was more than probable, in a position from which I could not extricate myself. Already she was wondering—a step further and her wonder would assume a shape. I hastened to vindicate myself, and then dropped the subject. Before the eloquence of my words the girl's momentary suspicion dissolved like snow.</p>
               <p>Winnie continued to chatter, but not of Madelon, or what particularly interested me. In fact, I scarcely heard her; my mind was otherwise engaged. A panorama of the Jesuit's life was unrolling before my inward eyes. I saw it all—saw the sensual priest—the virtuous wife—the bigoted father—the innocent child. Before me passed in review all that both<pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC5820-00000054"/> the priest and the girl had told me, and each story fitted nicely to the other. Thus brick by brick the superstructure of mystery and crime towered up—the architect, Father Huestace—the builder, myself.</p>
               <p>Such were my reflections—such the condition of my mind. My thoughts, however, impressed me differently at that time from what they do now; for then I lived and breathed but at the direction of others—then, my heavenly Master, and my earthly king, were combined in the Church—the Church, supreme and infallible—the only One power upon earth.</p>
               <p>Finally, my thoughts assumed another character. With lightning speed I reviewed the Jesuit's position; and I felt convinced, that he was the person pointed at, and that he was vigilantly watched; that Madelon had a lover who was admitted into all their secrets as one deeply interested; and that in a little while only both the girl and her estate would be wrested forever from the Church.</p>
               <p>Here I was aroused to outward consciousness by Winnie, who, having completed what she was saying observed my abstraction, and poutingly took me to task for it. I, however, excused myself in a satisfactory manner—and what man that was loved ever failed to do that with the woman who loved him?—and dashed off in a rambling conversations.</p>
               <p>Again, however, my thoughts were wandering to other subjects. There was yet more that I desired to learn; for the information I had derived from the too credulous girl by my side, was in part known to me, and was not in reality of any practical use. What I had heard was all very well as far as it went, but it would not assist, either in securing Madelon, or preventing a marriage; and one or both was what the Jesuit was scheming after. How should I contrive it? I thoughts How lead her to say something of Madelon's outgoings?</p>
               <p>At length we turned into the noble Square upon which Mrs. Hawley resided; a few moments more and the chance would be lost. I knew not what to say or how to proceed. For once my ingenuity was at fault; and in complete despair I gave utterance to the first thought that came into my mind. And yet that simple, unreflecting question, led to what was most desired and cost three persons—but I will not anticipate.</p>
               <p>"When shall we meet again, Winnie?" I inquired, with all the ardor of a sincere lover. "I have <emph>something of importance</emph> to communicate to you for<pb n="104-105" xml:id="VAC5820-00000055"/> which there is not now time. I have been so absorbed, and interested, in the persecutions to which your unfortunate mistress is a victim, that I forgot my own affairs entirely."</p>
               <p>The girl brightened up quickly. The words "something of importance" possessed a peculiar meaning to her, and they made music in her heart—rang out, clear and sweet, like the joyous chime of wedding bells.</p>
               <p>"I can scarcely say, Joseph," she replied, quite unsuspiciously—"but at all events on the first opportunity, and that won't be long occurring. My mistress, you know, treats me. more as a friend than as a domestic; and were it not for the fear in which she stands, I should not hesitate a moment in inviting you to the house. As it is we must be content to do the best we can."</p>
               <p>That was not satisfactory to me—not what I wanted.</p>
               <p>"But can't you name some time, Winnie?" I persisted. "You must surely have some idea when an opportunity will be most likely to occur?"</p>
               <p>"You are so persevering," the girl responded, still innocent of any sinister motive. "I suppose I must gratify you. Let me think. I have it. Miss Madelon will visit her friend, Anna Sinclair, to morrow, and not return home until in the evening, as I heard her ask her cousin Charles if he would call for her."</p>
               <p>That was the very disclosure I had been aiming at from the beginning—the very things the Jesuit desired—another opportunity. How it was to be used this time, I was yet to learn.</p>
               <p>"Then we shall have an opportunity of meeting," I replied, apparently very delighted. "But at what hour, Winnie?"</p>
               <p>"Miss Madelon's cousin is not to call for her until ten o'clock," she answered. "You can call for me by eight, and we can have an hour's walk all to ourselves. I don't like to ask it, Joseph, but please come to the basement-door. For the present I do not wish the family to know that I have company."</p>
               <p>"Thanks, Winnie, thanks! and no excuses, for I am content," I responded. "But does not your mistress tremble to be out so late in the evening?"</p>
               <p>"I have said so, Joseph; but she can't remain always at home," the girl replied. "Besides; she invariably rides when out after dark, and is never unaccompanied by either her cousin, or"—again the girl broke off with tokens of confusion; but after a moment's pause she continued as if she had only referred to the cousin—"and he is always prepared for<pb n="106-107" xml:id="VAC5820-00000056"/> any violence which her enemies may resort to. She is always driven to, and from, wherever she wishes to go, and generally by our own trusty coachman. Sometimes, however, though not often, Mr. Charles, if business, or any other engagement, calls him from home upon the same evening Miss Madelon is absent, does not order the family carriage to be in attendance, but picks up a chaise wherever he chances to be, and fetches her home in that manner. Mrs. Hawley thinks it highly imprudent, and has so expressed herself to her son on each occasion; but he says that it is a great deal less trouble, and so long as he is with Miss Madelon there is no danger."</p>
               <p>"He should not be too confident," I replied, devouring every word the imprudent girl said. "He knows not when danger may surround him, for these crafty priests are forever on the alert, and deal their blows when and where they are least expected."</p>
               <p>"True, Joseph," responded Winnie; "and so his mother has repeatedly warned him, but like the rest of you men he is a little headstrong. But see, I am home!"</p>
               <p>At that moment we stopped in front of Mrs. Hawley's new residence, and a gleam of light suddenly shone from an upper window, and flashed upon the sidewalk at our feet. It attracted my attention, and I looked up just in time to see the queen form of Madelon flit past.</p>
               <p>"Miss Madelon has been looking for me, I know," said Winnie. "I have loitered too long. Good night, Joseph, and be secret above all things."</p>
               <p>"Depend upon me, Winnie," I answered, as I pressed her hand. Then with another "good night" the girl darted into the house, and I turned my steps in the direction of the church. I had played my part well; and if consummate rascality could have recommended me to favor, I was then entitled to considerable promotion. In every sense of the word I had played the poor girl false; trifled with her integrity, and tampered with her affections. It only remained for me to betray her confidence. You shall see what came of it.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
               <p>THOUGH the distance between Mrs. Hawley's mansion and the church was considerable, I reached the latter in a short time. I was, of course, immediately ushered into the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">sanctum sanctorum.</foreign>
               </p>
               <p>As I entered the priest's dimly lighted and sepulchral looking apartment, I noticed that his brow was clouded, and his lips compressed, as if his thoughts, whatever they were, were not the most pleasant, or agreeable, or desirable. Locking the door—a customary caution with the Jesuit—he seated himself by the table, and desired me to do likewise.</p>
               <p>I complied. After regarding me for a few moments quite attentively, he remarked;</p>
               <p>"Well, my good Joseph, what news? I think you have some—your looks betoken it."</p>
               <p>"True your reverence, I have news," I replied. "But whether it will prove desirable news, or be of service, remains to be seen. I came while yet the recollection was fresh, so that you might not lose a word."</p>
               <p>"Well, well, my good Joseph, what is it?" the priest inquired, somewhat irritably, at the same time throwing himself back in his easy chair.</p>
               <p>That he was chafed about something I plainly saw. Probably his conscience had been goading him; if, indeed, he could boast of such an appendage.</p>
               <p>I paused a moment to collect my scattered thoughts before I proceeded, and then went on.</p>
               <p>"It is this," I replied, in a low, but distinct, whisper. "I met Miss Hawley's dressing-maid and demi-companion early this evening—a young and rather confiding creature for whom I have affected love, that I might the more easily mislead her. We walked together, and on the way she told me much."</p>
               <p>"Indeed? This looks like business! <emph>She</emph> should know something, as she has every opportunity. Well, Joseph, well!" exclaimed the Jesuit, impatiently, leaning forward upon the table, and dropping his chin into the palm of his hands.</p>
               <p>"It was a difficult task,"—I continued—"but<pb n="110-111" xml:id="VAC5820-00000058"/> nevertheless I managed the girl very successfully. <emph>They</emph>—you understand me?"—the priest nodded affirmatively—"they fear a conspiracy to deprive Madelon of her wealth—or worse, of her life; and that is why she goes so seldom abroad, and never unattended."</p>
               <p>"Considering what has already occurred, one might guess that much, my good Joseph, nor yet be thought a prophet," remarked Father Huestace, "Proceed!"</p>
               <p>"Your reverence did not hear me through," I replied, not liking, though I feared to murmur against, the tone he adopted, I had become so fascinated—what else can I term it?—with the crafty priest.</p>
               <p>"Well, well, Joseph, get on!" the priest exclaimed. "I am on the rack. What more? Say it briefly, for my patience brooks not long stories."</p>
               <p>"Neither have they forgot"—I continued, rather deliberately—"a certain bootless attempt at poisoning; and frequently they talk of it; and though names are never mentioned, there is <emph>one</emph>—mark your reverence!—there is <emph>one</emph>, towards whom all their observations point."</p>
               <p>The face of the Jesuit grew suddenly white; and his brow contracted until I could scarcely see his eyes.</p>
               <p>"Towards <emph>me</emph>, I suppose!" he exclaimed, passionately. "Was it not so, Joseph?"</p>
               <p>I nodded, Yes.</p>
               <p>"I had thought so ever since, but, maledictions on them! the certainty of it makes half a coward of me. And did the babbling girl relate the whole circumstance?" he exclaimed, inquiringly. "All?"</p>
               <p>"All!" I replied, echoing his words. "All; except, indeed, what became of the woman who attempted the child's life. That, of course, they are all ignorant of."</p>
               <p>"And there I am safe, Joseph!" he exclaimed, exultingly. "They cannot penetrate that mystery. Dead men tell no tales! Ha! Ha! Ha! The grave cannot bear witness!"</p>
               <p>The priest's hollow laugh startled me—thrilled me; and I glanced nervously at the little window, almost fancying that I beheld the spirit of the murdered woman gazing into the room, and pointing her fleshless fingers at us. It was a horrible fancy, and chilled me from head to foot.</p>
               <p>"Continue, brother Joseph, continue!" he exclaimed, abruptly, after, a moment's pause. "I am prepared to hear you."</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC5820-00000059"/>
               <p>"It appears,"—I said, in compliance—"that Miss Hawley—"</p>
               <p>"Madelon, you mean, I suppose," said the priest, interrupting me.</p>
               <p>"The same!" I answered. "As I was saying, it appears, that Miss Hawley has a most tenacious memory, too; for she remembers and frequently speaks of things which occurred long ago—even before her mother's death."</p>
               <p>I paused, anticipating another display of passion on the part of the priest. But not so. The intimation which my words conveyed did not then rouse him. The storm was only gathering.</p>
               <p>"Before her mother's death, you say, Joseph?" he almost whispered. "Well, go on! go on! What does she remember?"</p>
               <p>"The girl communicated to me one circumstance in particular," I continued. "She had been present when her mistress had spoken of it. It was, how, when she—Madelon—was a small child, she had one day found a tall, dark, evil-looking priest—the girl's very words, your reverence—closeted with her mother; and how she had heard her mother indignantly threaten the priest—a Jesuit, and their family confessor fessor—with instant exposure, if he ever again presumed to repeat what he had then uttered."</p>
               <p>By this time the bosom of Father Huestace was surging with accumulated passion, all the more fearful that it had hitherto been restrained.</p>
               <p>"Malediction!" he hissed out. "Does the apostate girl remember that? And <emph>dares</emph> she to talk about it? Is it thus they prate in secret—thus they point at <emph>me</emph>—thus they call up by-gones and array them against me. Blistered be their tongues forever!"</p>
               <p>After walking the floor rapidly for a few moments—for in his excitement he had arisen from the table—he reseated himself, and addressed me.</p>
               <p>"And yet I do not fear them!"—he exclaimed, intensely;—"talk as they may—think as they may; for they have no proof, and the Church justifies me in crushing her enemies—nay, it applauds the deed. Better that we <emph>killed</emph> Madelon, than that the heretics should triumph in her apostacy, and revel in the wealth which rightly should enrich the Church. So much for the attempted poisoning; and for the rest, I <emph>did</emph> love Madelon's mother, and would have made her mine could I have done so. But I was a priest, and she was another's; and so, driven on by the intensest passion that ever consumed the human heart<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC5820-00000060"/> I sought the only other alternative. The woman scorned me—reviled me—heaped upon me the most withering contempt her high heart could conceive—threatened me with the largest exposure—forbade me the house—all—all! Mother of God, how I grew to hate that woman—that woman who had defied my power; trampled upon my heart; and laughed at the pains of my fierce passion! It was one of these interviews which the brat broke in upon. I remember it well, and so does she, it seems. Better, far better, that she did not."</p>
               <p>With a quick, nervous, movement, the Jesuit again arose from his chair, and striding across the room to the book-case, produced the inevitable black bottle. He quaffed deeply this time, and then placing it before me, bade me drink.</p>
               <p>"The mother,"—he continued, slightly calmed down—"died shortly after our last bitter interview; but to the end of her life I persecuted her in every possible manner—poisoned all her happiness—embittered all her days. We Jesuits, Joseph, never forego our vengeance!"</p>
               <p>I involuntarily trembled at the man's fierceness.</p>
               <p>A scowl, dark and terrible, flitted across the priest's working countenance. I began to stand in awe of the passionate and unprincipled being before me.</p>
               <p>Again he resumed.</p>
               <p>"Then all my hatred concentrated upon the child, the living image of the mother; and the circumstances of her seizure by the Protestants, together with the conditions of her father's will, seemed to open a channel for the gratification of my hate. I could at once serve both the Church and myself—perform my duty, and in a measure, at least, fling back the pain the mother had inflicted upon me. The loss of their wealth, if nothing else, shall yet compensate me for what I have suffered!"</p>
               <p>I now felt more than satisfied, that Father Huestace was as avaricious as he was revengeful; but his whole character and conduct was so mixed up, that he was really as inexplicable as the sphinx. I could but look on, wonder, and, like a child in leading-strings, <emph>obey!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>"You know the rest, my good Joseph," he again continued. "Now I do not intend to <emph>murder</emph> Madelon—unless indeed circumstances become too imperative—but while she is sweetly dreaming of husband, home, love, and happiness, I will rudely awaken her to a realizing sense of a convent's realities. To me that will be exquisite vengeance, while the Church will be nobly served both in procurement of her devotion<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC5820-00000061"/> votion to that faith in which her father lived and died, and in the rescue of her large estate from the grasp of a heretic husband."</p>
               <p>What a medley of dark feelings had the Jesuit vented in the few words which he had last given utterance to. But over them all, in conclusion, he cast the mantle of the Church, as if he fancied that through it his real design could not be penetrated; or if it was, that it could not be arrayed against him. With me he had thrown off the reserve which slightly distinguished our first intercourse; but he still endeavored to convince me, that the gratification of his own feelings were but secondary—that the triumph of the Church was the <foreign xml:lang="LAT">ultima thule</foreign> of all his desires—all his ambition. This he more frequently implied than expressed directly; but in one way or the other, it stood out prominently in all his conversations.</p>
               <p>"But the lover, Joseph, the lover—what concerning him?" he inquired, suddenly. "Is he a myth, or is he a giant, or but the creation of a rumor? I feel in my heart, that I shall hate him as I do the recreant girl—as I hated the mother when that mother treated me like a dog. Come, Joseph, you have heard much this night—did you hear aught of him?"</p>
               <p>"Something, I imagine," was my somewhat abstracted stracted reply; for I was inwardly conning over the Jesuit's last declaration.</p>
               <p>"There <emph>is</emph> a lover, then!" exclaimed the Jesuit, actually hissing the words between his set teeth.</p>
               <p>"I think so," I answered.</p>
               <p>"His name, his name, Joseph?" the priest demanded, much excited. "Did you learn that?"</p>
               <p>"Frank—"</p>
               <p>"Frank! Maledictions!" cried the priest, interrupting me. "That man again! Well, go on, Joseph. What—what is his other name?"</p>
               <p>"That I could not learn," I answered.</p>
               <p>"Not learn!" cried Father Huestace, angrily.</p>
               <p>"No, your reverence," I replied. "Listen, and you will understand why I could not learn it."</p>
               <p>"Well, go on! go on!" he said, quite evidently not very well pleased. "So important, too! Well, proceed! proceed!"</p>
               <p>And then regardless of my promise to Winnie—of my honor—of my soul's eternal welfare, I proceeded to relate to the plotting and revengeful Jesuit, word for word, all the remainder of my conversation with the girl. What induced me? you may ask. Education! is my answer.</p>
               <p>Throughout the rest of my communication the<pb n="118-119" xml:id="VAC5820-00000062"/> priest did not once interrupt me further than by expressing in brief monosyllables either his anger, surprise or pleasure; all three of which emotions my words, alternately and strongly agitated. He seemed particularly disappointed and distressed, When I recounted my ineffectual efforts to learn more of the lover; but when, at length, I informed him concerning Madelon's projected visit on the following evening, the features of his face relaxed, and he rubbed his hands together joyfully. His delight was manifest.</p>
               <p>"Ah! well done, my good Joseph!" he exclaimed, as soon as my manner indicated that I had finished.</p>
               <p>"We have at length, methinks, run the game down. We will not now kindle a conflagration, that we may carry the girl off in the smoke, but with a subtler cunning entice her into a web, from which she cannot extricate herself. Your Winnie—thank the simple creature—has done the Church, though unwittingly, good service. But we must to work, to work, for the time is brief;"—and the priest spoke quickly, bending down over the table, as he did so; "the girl once in our hands, must be got out of the city as soon as possible; and that will be, when our personal safety permits. The lover, and we must quickly find out who he really is—knows too much—will be likely to push inquiry too far, and must be seen to—must be seen to, Joseph. Leave him to me, however. Once let me be certain of his identity, and I will deal surely with the ardent heretic. If it be this Frank, I owe him the principal and interest of a blow which yet rankles in my flesh."</p>
               <p>"But how are we to proceed now, your reverence?" I inquired. "What do you contemplate?"</p>
               <p>"I am not exactly prepared to say, Joseph," he answered. "A scheme is floating through my brain, but it is not yet matured. I must sleep upon it. We are, however, approaching a climax, either for good or ill. The time has come when we must be more cautious still. One hasty or miscalculated move and the heretics will again, and perchance, irremediably checkmate us. Therefore caution, Joseph, caution. Defeat this time would overwhelm us. But go your way now, for I must have time for reflection. Come to-morrow morning early; but first find out where this Anna Sinclair resides—that is essential."</p>
               <p>I had started towards the door, when the sound of the priest's voice caused me to turn round again.</p>
               <p>"And, Joseph, before you go, a thought has struck me," he said. "Are you to any extent familiar<pb n="120-121" xml:id="VAC5820-00000063"/> with the tone of voice, and the manner, of Madelon's cousin, Charles?"</p>
               <p>"I have both seen him, and heard him converse, frequently," I replied, wondering at what he was aiming.</p>
               <p>"Could you personate him pretty well? I have somewhere heard—from the Vicar General, or somebody—that the art of imitation and mimicry was not the least of your accomplishments. Was I misinformed?"</p>
               <p>"Your reverence was not," I responded. "The gift—for it is natural, and not acquired, has frequently created much wonderment. I could personate any man living."</p>
               <p>"And well—quite well?" demanded the priest.</p>
               <p>"Yes, your reverence," I replied. "In this case <emph>so</emph> well that I would defy even Madelon to discover the difference, provided that she did not see me."</p>
               <p>"I am right glad of it, my good Joseph," the priest continued. "It would have been unfortunate otherwise; as it is, it certainly renders our chance of success all the better. And now, good night, again, and do not forget to find out where Madelon's friend resides. The heretics!—we shall beat them yet, Joseph, we shall beat them yet! And let me but once see Madelon, and her lover—for it would be a shame to part them—safe on their way to Rome, and I am satisfied."</p>
               <p>The Jesuit turned away as he uttered the last words, and I silently glided from the room.</p>
               <p>Safe on their way to Rome! That was news to me.</p>
               <p>Heretofore the priest had but referred ambiguously to his ultimate intention, but now he expressed himself in decided terms. Rome, mighty Rome! was Madelon's final destination, and the lover's too, it seemed. To those who could appreciate the workings of such a nature as was the priest's, nothing would be easier to understand than why Madelon's lover had—even when his existence was but a vague suspicion—incurred the animosity of the long resentful Jesuit. To men like him, whose malice is undying, and whose hatred is unbounded, it is but natural. Their happiness—their prosperity—had Madelon have wedded would have driven him frantic. Thus, in his heart, he had condemned the lover; and circumstances but tended to confirm his determination. The suspicion which at that time possessed him, that it was from the hands of Madelon's intended that he had received the blow on the<pb n="122-123" xml:id="VAC5820-00000064"/> night of the conflagration but whetted his desire to include him in the girl's misfortune. Any man with <emph>his</emph> feelings—corrupted as they were—placed in similar circumstances, would, doubtless, have experienced the same unreasonable passions.</p>
               <p>These constituted the undercurrent of the Jesuit's thoughts and desires, and it was left for time and circumstances to lay them bare to my gaze.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>THE morrow came as all morrows, do—buoyant with life, and heavy with death—rosy with health, and pale with sickness—overflowing with plenty, and pinched with want—bright and bounding with gladness and joy, and black and terrible with sorrow and grief.</p>
               <p>To some it brought disappointment—to some despair—to some death; and to at few, comparatively speaking, happiness. To many it was as the day before—as the day after would be.</p>
               <p>To the poor it presented the same endless round, of labor—the same inward agony—the same narrow sphere, mentally and physically. To the rich the same gaiety—the same pleasure (!) and alas! the same hard, worldly, hearts. These remain unchanged the world over, and day after day. Great armies may annihilate each other—the pestilence may<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC5820-00000065"/> depopulate—the earthquake swallow up—the flood engulf; and all things change, but the rich man's pleasure, and the poor man's agony—they are eternal. How much happier and better people would be, could each but realize a portion of the other's inheritance. But the one will not and the other cannot; so the world must even jog on as it is.</p>
               <p>The morning's light, too, broke alike upon the vision of the sinner and the saint—the friend and the foe—the guilty and the innocent. The Jesuit with his head full of schemes—the lover with his heart running over with affection—the maiden, anxious, but trembling, for the future, and happy, as might be, in the blissful ignorance which, rendered her oblivious of the day's closing; all, so widely separated in some things, so closely united in others, in the same hour welcomed the outspreading of Heaven's light. Some looked forward to it for the good it light bring—some for the wrong which should then be consummated.</p>
               <p>But let us leave these speculations. The morning is up, and the world awake—our world at least. Already the picture crowds upon the canvass, and the panorama once more moves.</p>
               <p>And now again for the reality.</p>
               <p>The atmosphere was cuttingly cold, and the sky filled with heavy, leaden colored clouds, indicating a fall of snow. Everything out-doors presented a cheerless aspect; the streets, the houses, the bare and leafless trees; all—even the men, and women, and children, rushed along at an unusual rate of speed, as if they fancied that by haste they might escape the sombre influence of the weather. It is thus that we all seek to run away from the disagreeables of life, but too seldom achieve our object. We may chain the lightning to our feet, but we cannot escape the dark days.</p>
               <p>At an early hour—early for that season of the year, at least—I was abroad. I had just so much time to spare, and a great deal to crowd in it. I therefore portioned out my plans in accordance with my allotted time. It may be well to mention, that in consequence of Mr. Ellis' easy manner of living, I was enabled to frequently absent myself from the house—in fact daily—and very often for quite a considerable period. It was thus that I managed to keep up my communication with Father Huestace. With many masters I would have found the task a much more difficult one. A good excuse, too, never failed of securing me a holiday when I desired it.</p>
               <pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC5820-00000066"/>
               <p>As I have said, on this day I was, early abroad. With considerable difficulty I succeeded in finding out where Mrs. Sinclair resided. That accomplished, I directed my steps towards the church. Arrived there I was soon closeted with the priest, and in five minutes had communicated to him my success in carrying, out his wishes. Father Huestace seemed delighted, and expressed himself in highly laudatory terms.</p>
               <p>After receiving some further particulars and instructions relating to the contemplated abduction, I was dismissed, with the injunction to keep as strict a watch as my time would permit, and as I could, without exposing myself or exciting suspicion, around the house at which. Madelon was visiting; and to report to the priest, should I discover any movement likely to interfere with the successful accomplishment of the scheme in view.</p>
               <p>The Jesuit and myself were to meet again that evening—should no unforeseen circumstance occur in the mean time to interfere with the contemplated adventure—at a certain point which he designated.</p>
               <p>The hours passed quickly on, and found me alternately gliding between the residence of Mr. Ellis and the home of the Sinclair's. Notwithstanding, however, I got but my trouble for my pains. At length daylight passed away, and a heavy darkness settled upon the great city. As night approached, snow began to fall, and each moment after, the white flakes fell faster and faster—thicker and thicker. The streets were soon almost deserted, and at an earlier hour than usual the greater proportion of the stores were closed up for the night.</p>
               <p>The Jesuit's present plan for the abduction of Madelon, was bolder and more daring, if any thing, than the previous one. It seemed almost incredible, that any human being could be found with audacity and confidence enough to attempt it. For my own part, I did not believe it at all practicable, and I grew nervous at the thought of what might prove the <foreign xml:lang="ITA">finale</foreign>. Madelon might not visit her friend; illness, or any one of a dozen other causes might prevent her—I had been unable to discover any thing with certainty—then she might return home before the hour specified—and even if in these particulars all went well, she might still detect the cheat we designed putting upon her. In the event of either, discomfiture was certain, and a fatal exposure highly probable.</p>
               <p>Father Huestace and myself were to meet upon a<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC5820-00000067"/> certain corner about halfway between the church and the residence of Miss Sinclair. Pulling the collar of my surtout close up around my ears, and my fur-cap down over my eyes, I hastened off, when near to the appointed hour, for our <foreign xml:lang="FRA">rendezvous</foreign>.</p>
               <p>After a half hour's brisk trotting—it was too cold and stormy to think of walking—I came within sight of the point agreed upon. A solitary hack was standing upon the corner designated, and the rough looking driver, closely muffled up, was trotting up and down the pavement beating his arms together to keep himself warm, I was about passing the vehicle as nothing unusual, when a light tap upon the window glass arrested my attention. I stopped. Immediately the door was opened slightly, and a familiar voice, necessarily smothered, called, "Joseph!"</p>
               <p>"Is that you, Father Huestace?" I inquired, in a whisper, stepping at the same time towards the hack.</p>
               <p>"Yes," said he, in a tone barely audible. "But your question was an imprudent one. Suppose it had not been <emph>me</emph>, what a clue someone would have had to <emph>our</emph> identity; for, Joseph, when I fall, you are likely to totter. As it is, no harm is done, so jump in quickly, for though the night is dark and stormy, we may be observed."</p>
               <p>"Yis, ye'r honor, be lively, or somebody might be askin', what was goin' on," exclaimed the hackman, at the same time gently pushing me into the vehicle. "They're mighty inquisitive, these dom'd Yankees!"</p>
               <p>By the time the hackman had thus expressed his opinion of the "dom'd Yankees," I was seated, and the door was closed. A moment after and we moved off at a rather rapid rate. For several minutes after starting a mutual silence ensued. The Jesuit, buried in his huge black cloak, remained with his eyes bent downward, doubtless busy in the mazes of his scheme; and I gazed out the window at the swiftly falling snow flakes.</p>
               <p>At length the priest lifted his eyes to my face, and addressed me, evidently in the same strain in which he had been last ruminating; and his voice betokened a confidence it is not at all probable he then really felt. He but sought, doubtless, to encourage me; and probably his own feelings required some little bolstering.</p>
               <p>"We are now, my good Joseph, fairly out at sea," he remarked, in an earnest, unwavering, tone. "In a brief space we shall either be wrecked upon the rocks which surround us, or snugly moored in<pb n="130-131" xml:id="VAC5820-00000068"/> safe harbor with the coveted prize beyond the chance of rescue. What think you now?"</p>
               <p>"Does your reverence actually want to know?" I demanded, doubtful of his real wish.</p>
               <p>"Most assuredly!" he responded, emphatically.</p>
               <p>"Then I must say that I think the first part of your prediction is most likely to be verified," I answered, plainly.</p>
               <p>"Not so, Joseph, not so!" he rejoined, quickly. "From the first, daring as the scheme is, I have felt thoroughly confident of a successful issue. In fact the very audacity of the thing is its greatest defence—the surest guaranty of our ultimate triumph. Not one person in a thousand would have a suspicion of such an attempt under such circumstances; and upon that I count largely. Yes, Joseph, there is something whispers me, and I believe its truth, that this night Madelon Hawley will be lost to her Protestant friends—lost to her heretic lover—lost to herself; but retained, and forever, to the Church. Aye, this night, that Church, which she has so basely deserted, and her hated friends mocked, <emph>shall</emph> triumph, my good Joseph. No longer shall the vile heretics trample upon our power, and lord it over the true, and faithful followers, of the only living Church. No! the day of our success has come; and the hour of their downfall approaches. The labor of sixteen years shall this night bring forth its fruit."</p>
               <p>The priest paused; and I thought that if the confidence of his words was an evidence of success, we were indeed likely to come off triumphant. But the abduction of Madelon required more than mere words.</p>
               <p>"And this night too,"—he continued,—"Madelon shall begin that atonement which she owes to the Church for long years of heresy—to her father's memory outraged by her apostacy."</p>
               <p>The Jesuit's words, which but always hid a darker intent, struck coldly to my heart; and even then, Papist as I was—conspirator as I was—cheat as I was, I began to feel some compunctious visitings. At that moment a little human sympathy began to creep into my heart, when up before me arose the shadow of the crime I had already committed—my fear of the Jesuit's power—and my oath to the Church of Rome, as if to frighten from me the generous thought.</p>
               <p>"Oath!" I exclaimed, interrupting the old man in his narration, "Are priests sworn, too?"</p>
               <pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC5820-00000069"/>
               <p>"Yes," he replied, earnestly. "Sworn to obey the mother Church of Rome, as the chief Head and matron above all pretended Churches throughout the whole earth, and to serve with zeal St. Peter and his successors, as the founder of the true and ancient Catholic faith, against all heretical kings, princes, states, or powers, repugnant to the same. Hereafter remember that. Priests are the sworn enemies of everything that is repugnant to the Catholic faith. More, they are bounden "not to declare, act or control any matter prejudicial to the Church, and in all things to further her interests more than their own, earthly good and earthly pleasure, as she and her Head, his Holiness, are or should be supreme over everything." Are, priests sworn? Why oaths—and oaths which actually consume a man's identity—absorb his real self, and make of him but a mere walking automaton; which turn from him, all sympathy for any and everything outside his restricted bounds—which deprive him of both mental and physical liberty, and compel implicit obedience to the One power, compose the very foundation of the Romish superstructure. It is in this that the papal hierarchy, is strong—is far-reaching—is infallible;—it is in this, that she can, and does, frequently, accomplish ends and purposes which astonish and startle, and often curse the world. The word of one man, for good or bad, and bad always, in that the purpose is not for humanity's sake, but for the benefit of the One power, and therefore utterly selfish, sets the whole vast complicated machine silently but surely to work.</p>
               <p>But enough of this, or my feeble and worn energies will be entirely consumed before I have half completed my narrative. You have yet much to hear—much that will better prove what I mean than all I could, say. Where was I? Ah, yes, I remember.</p>
               <p>There was a momentary pause when the priest had finished the expression of his very confident opinion. And still the vehicle rolled rapidly along.</p>
               <p>"But may not your reverence be too sanguine?" I, at length, inquired. "These Protestants are eagle-eyed, while our adventure is at best, as you yourself admit, reckless and audacious."</p>
               <p>"It is all that, Joseph,"—said Father Huestace—"and yet not necessarily impossible. As desperate schemes have heretofore been adopted, and carried to successful issues. It wants confidence more than anything else—confidence in one's own innate power<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC5820-00000070"/> and ability. That more than any other quality makes a great man—elevates him above and beyond the common herd. As dangers and difficulties increase and multiply, such men rise with the occasion, boldly grappling and overthrowing every opposing element. While the weak-hearted by their indecision and fear court defeat, they, with a superior confidence, which is but a species of courage, press on and eventually conquer a glorious victory. Such a man, in a measure, Joseph, am I. Not a hero, nor yet, probably, a great man in any manner; but still one who has the mind to conceive, and the confidence to execute what to others would appear utterly impossible. No, no, Joseph—my spirit is indomitable. The toil and trouble of many years, with the certainty of several failures staring me right in the face, does not now damp my ardor or impair that confidence I have in final success. There is not room enough in my heart for a doubt to creep in. And yet confidence, in every case, requires auxiliaries—in the present, caution and cunning. Too sanguine, my good Joseph! Why, even the weather favors us again; a better night we could not have selected, if we ourselves had had the choosing. In fact, it was the probability—almost certainty—of just such a night, that influenced me in adopting the measures I have. The weather has answered all my hopes and anticipations."</p>
               <p>"But <emph>should</emph> we fail and be detected—for despite the arguments of your reverence, I believe there is every chance—what then?" I inquired, somewhat anxious to know what the priest contemplated, if anything, in such a contingency.</p>
               <p>"If the former—withdraw and await another opportunity; if the latter, flee the country!" he answered, with that readiness which betokened a familiarity with the subject in all its bearings. "There are other lands, Joseph—and lands where the Church acknowledges no law but her own sovereign will; obeys no master's but her own Superior's; and bends to no circumstances, but of her own making; and where not one, from the king upon his throne, to the beggar on the highway, dares think or act independent of her expressed or even implied will. There, Joseph, we can find a refuge—there the broad wings of the Church will protect us from the violation of all laws but those of her own making. But I do not anticipate any such result; perform but your part properly, and the girl will be in our keeping and without any danger of discovery to ourselves."</p>
               <pb n="136-137" xml:id="VAC5820-00000071"/>
               <p>After that we both again dropped into silence; for the last declaration of the priest was unanswerable. And still the vehicle rolled along quietly, and now somewhat slowly, in consequence of the fast increasing bed of snow; notwithstanding the driver was evidently urging his horses onward somewhat smartly.</p>
               <p>"But this hackman!" I exclaimed, in a few moments, as the thought suddenly struck me that <emph>he</emph> at least would soon see that treachery was a-foot, and possibly betray us.</p>
               <p>Bear in mind that I was only now learning the minute particulars of the scheme; heretofore the priest had only thought proper to enlarge me upon a portion of it.</p>
               <p>"Will be as secret as though death had closed his lips forever!" said the Jesuit, in answer to my question. "He is the same who waited my bidding on the night of the conflagration. It is not the first, or the second time, that he has done me a good service. He is perfectly familiar with all our schemes, Joseph; and is a valuable adjunct to those who can trust him. I can."</p>
               <p>"All!" I exclaimed, looking at the priest, amazed, and wondering that he should trust such a creature with so weighty a secret.</p>
               <p>"But <emph>he—is—my—slave!</emph>" rejoined the Jesuit, with a strong accentuation.</p>
               <p>The reply was all-sufficient. Indeed I might have known as much, had I been at that moment half as clear-headed as my companion. His slave! The words guaranteed the man's silence.</p>
               <p>"Years ago,"—continued the priest—"this man had a gay and pretty wife, of whom he at length grew so jealous that in one of his mad fits—brutalized, too, by strong drink—he <emph>murdered</emph> her. I chanced—how it matters not—to be at partial witness to the deed, and the only one. I saw him as he stood there, bending over the bleeding and mutilated form of his young wife, his hands and clothes dyed in her warm red blood, and no obligation of the Confessional stood between me and the secret. I could have sent him to the gallows; but I did better—I made him my slave. I can trust him."</p>
               <p>"Was he not arrested?" I inquired, nervously.</p>
               <p>"Yes," answered the priest—"and thrown into prison. A long and tedious trial ensued, but the evidence for the prosecution proved unsatisfactory, and <emph>we</emph> finally swore him clear. Even to this day, he<pb n="138-139" xml:id="VAC5820-00000072"/> trembles at the least allusion to the circumstances I can trust him. A hint from me, and he would again murder. But stop, we must be near the house from the length of time that has elapsed since we started."</p>
               <p>The priest lowered one of the side windows, and shading his eyes with his hands peered out.</p>
               <p>"'Tis a miserable night, Joseph; but not one at which we should complain," he muttered, as a gust of wind drove a mass of the cold flakes violently into, his face, and compelled him to draw back, and close the window.</p>
               <p>After proceeding some little distance further, the driver beat down to on of the windows, and tapping against the glass hailed us.</p>
               <p>"Whist, y'er riverence; all right—here we are; I know the house," he exclaimed, in a whisper. "Howly Mother, how it shows!" he continued, a moment after, and in a louder key. </p>
               <p>"Be prudent, Patrick; as you value body and soul, be prudent!" muttered the priest, sternly. "Follow my directions, and do neither more nor less—you will not then go astray. Now drive up to the house."</p>
               <p>The priest had again lowered the window, when the hackman, or Patrick, as I shall call him, tapped upon the glass; at the conclusion of the foregoing speech he drew it up once more.</p>
               <p>Directly the vehicle scraped against the curbstone, and Patrick expertly alighted, again shook the snow from his shaggy overcoat, and threw open the door, at the same time making as much noise in that manner, as he conveniently could. All this was done, too, with a confidence, that would have given the lie to any suspicion of a dishonest motive. Confidence is indeed a great conqueror, and has won many a desperate battle.</p>
               <p>It was still snowing, and the atmosphere was almost impervious from the falling flakes. I peeped out and found that we were standing directly in front of the Sinclair mansion, where, of course, we calculated upon finding Madelon. The lower range of windows were tightly closed, and we could see nothing; but as we drove up, the sound of pleasant voices, greeted us from within. The priest listened for a moment, and then remarked;</p>
               <p>"Madelon is here, Joseph; rest assured all's well."</p>
               <p>"Yes, that ends well," I replied, naturally though hardly conscious, from a multitude of other thoughts, of what I was saying.</p>
               <p>"True, Joseph; and if this ends not well, call me<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC5820-00000073"/> no prophet," responded the Jesuit. "But draw back a moment"—I had bent forward—"and you, Patrick, stand still where you are."</p>
               <p>The other stately mansions upon both sides of the street were also closed up; and altogether the whole square presented a dark and deserted appearance. Even the gas-light upon the corner burned dimly, and through the falling snow flakes looked like a little, twinkling star. All was still, and dark, and lonely; and I myself felt satisfied that we we're not likely to be disturbed by the eye of idle curiosity; for on such a night <cit>

               </p>
               <p>According to the priest's directions I drew back into the vehicle without uttering another word, Father Huestace reconnoitered the premises from the basement to the roof, and I felt assured that then at least, if really not before, he began to appreciate the importance of the task he had undertaken—began to realize that success, in a great measure, depended upon the girl's thoughtlessness and credulity.</p>
               <p>We where then sitting upon the side of the hack nearest the Sinclair residence, each of us occupying a separate seat. Directly the priest withdrew to the off side, at the same time bidding me to continue in the position I already occupied. I obeyed. He then let fall the crimson silk curtain to the side-window near him, thus enveloping the interior of the vehicle in almost impenetrable darkness.</p>
               <p>All this had really occupied but a very few minutes after the driver alighted.</p>
               <p>"Now, Joseph, be on the alert," said the priest, addressing me. Then turning to the hackman he whispered;</p>
               <p>"Patrick, ring the bell!"</p>
               <p>"All right, ye'r riverence," responded the man, as he turned away from the carriage, and began to ascend the high steps of the building.</p>
               <p>That my heart sank within my bosom it is needless to deny. I never was a coward, and yet I trembled then.</p>
               <p>A female domestic almost instantly answered Patrick's bold and confident summons; but he, instead of immediately withdrawing from the door, as he should have done, tipped his hat obsequiously, and was evidently preparing to address the maid. The priest quickly bent forward, and his painful anxiety was manifested by his short, quick, breathing.</p>
               <pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC5820-00000074"/>
               <p>"Maledictions!" he hissed out almost inaudible; immediately comprehending Patrick's intention, and the effect it would be likely to produce. "Speak, Joseph, speak!" he continued, turning to, me with much excitement, and grasping my arm nervously. "The rascal's tongue will ruin us; and I forgot to caution him. Speak! Speak!"</p>
               <p>"Inform Miss Hawley, that her, cousin is waiting for her!" I exclaimed, quickly, readily, assuming the exact expression of the gentleman referred to.</p>
               <p>Patrick appeared to take the hint, upon hearing another address the girl, and immediately descended the steps.</p>
               <p>"Her cousin Charles, I presume," said the girl, entirely led astray by the deception. Even the priest started at the sound of my voice, and muttered "admirable!"</p>
               <p>"The same," I replied.</p>
               <p>"Said I not that she was here!" whispered the priest, exultingly, "Now, Joseph, let the girl obtain a slight glimpse of your person, but keep your face well shaded."</p>
               <p>I unhesitatingly did as he directed me.</p>
               <p>"Will you not alight, sir?" the girl continued, addressing me almost at the same time with the priest.</p>
               <p>"No, not this evening," I replied. "Merely announce that I have come."</p>
               <p>With a "yes sir," the girl closed the door—in consequence of the storm, I suppose—and disappeared within the house.</p>
               <p>And still the feathery flakes came down just as fast, and just as thick.</p>
               <p>Immediately upon the girl's disappearance, the priest, leaning slightly forward, called to Patrick.</p>
               <p>"Whist, ye'r riverence, here I am!" responded the mendacious rascal, springing to the door, and thrusting his murderous looking countenance into the vehicle.</p>
               <p>"Keep that mouth of your's shut, or your Irish tongue will betray us. You would have ruined as but a moment since, had you have spoken."</p>
               <p>"Ye'r riverence did'nt order me not to spake, and we always do. Sure an' its the custom, and I thought ye wanted me to, or ilse ye would have towld me!" Patrick replied, very humbly.</p>
               <p>"I suppose I am to blame; but mind, don't speak another word I until command you. Do you understand <emph>that</emph>?" cried the priest, with the tone and manner of a thorough tyrant.</p>
               <pb n="144-145" xml:id="VAC5820-00000075"/>
               <p>"Yis, ye'r riverence," responded his minion. "I'm dumb. Enything ilse, ye'r riverence?"</p>
               <p>"Stand aside! Hush!" muttered the priest, again withdrawing into the off corner.</p>
               <p>The crisis had come.</p>
               <p>At that moment the door of the house was re-opened, and Madelon, radiant in the most ineffable smiles, entered the hall accompanied on the one side by her friend Anna—at least so I judged—and on the other by no less a person than the veritable and mysterious Frank. I recognized him at the first glance, although I had never seen him since the day of the excommunication.</p>
               <p>"Observe the young gentleman, your reverence," I said, turning to the priest. "'Tis he—Frank!"</p>
               <p>"He <emph>here!</emph>" muttered the Jesuit, straining his gaze towards the door. "This begins to look as if my suspicions were correct. This <emph>may</emph> be the lover, Joseph! Doubtless, is! We shall see."</p>
               <p>I did not reply to the priest, nor did he volunteer any further remarks at that time.</p>
               <p>Behind Madelon and the other two appeared an elderly lady and gentleman, and further back several domestics were clustered in the hall. In one lightning glance I took in the number and position of the whole party. The abduction of Madelon under the very eyes of so many people, was at once a bold and villainous undertaking, and under such circumstances it was but natural to count the chances of success.</p>

               <p>MADELON walked forward to the front top step and peered at the hack, but it was too dark and stormy to see within, and suspicion had not sharpened her eyesight.</p>
               <p>Patrick stood beside the vehicle, holding, the door open with one hand, and blowing the fingers of the other to keep them warm. At that moment his actions were beyond suspicion.</p>
               <p>The priest had sunken back in the off corner, and was completely hidden from view.</p>
               <p>I occupied a seat near the door; but I had so arranged myself that not even the most prying eye could have caught the slightest glimpse of any portion of my person by which I could be recognized.</p>
               <p>"Is that you, cousin Charley?" Madelon inquired, as she stood there leaning slightly out the door, with her eyes fixed upon the carriage.</p>
               <p>"Certainly, Madelon, who else should it be?" I answered, boldly; still, of course, maintaining my assumed character. "Come now, make haste"—I continued—"for it is getting late and the streets are in a miserable condition for travelling."</p>
               <p>At the first sound of Madelon's musical voice the priest had clutched my arm with nervous anxiety. As I concluded the foregoing speech he withdrew his hand, and heaved a sigh of relief. Madelon evidently did not detect the counterfeit. And that was owing, doubtless, to three causes combined; my very natural imitation—the buzzing sound, if I may so style it, of the driving storm; and her freedom from suspicion at the moment.</p>
               <p>"Will you not come into the house, Mr. Hawley?" inquired Madelon's friends, simultaneously.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, not to-night," I replied. "I have been suffering with a very severe cold during the greater portion of the day, and it would not be, prudent for me to expose myself too much in such a storm as this. In fact, I should not have come out at all to-night, but under the peculiar circumstances which<pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC5820-00000077"/> surround Madelon. You can, doubtless, appreciate the necessity that brings me forth."</p>
               <p>"Such being the case, Charley, it certainly would be very ungenerous to insist upon your alighting," remarked the young man, Miss Sinclair's brother, Madelon's lover, and young Hawley's intimate friend, as after circumstances developed.</p>
               <p>"Better bathe your feet in warm water, and take some hot ginger-tea before you go to bed, Mr. Hawley," exclaimed the old lady, in the rear, kindly. "You'll feel the better for it, when you get up."</p>
               <p>"Don't get out, Charles," continued Madelon, sweetly; "I will be ready in a moment. I'm sorry that you are not well, indeed, I am!"</p>
               <p>There was an instant's pause; when, all at once, a sudden thought, and it might have been a slightly suspicious one, seemed to enter her mind, and she exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"But, cousin Charles, if you have just come from home, why did you not bring our own carriage, and not a public conveyance, as I perceive you have? You know how aunt disapproves of such a course."</p>
               <p>I could feel the priest tremble, for the question was such an abrupt one, and so little foreseen.</p>
               <p>I knew that all now depended upon my answer, and the conviction seemed to render my mind as clear as a crystal. In a single moment I reviewed every circumstance that I had discovered in connection with the family; and there were a number of trifling things that had fallen under my observation; and almost without any effort on my own part an answer suggested itself. My knowledge of how matters stood immediately satisfied me of its excellence, and I hastened to reply;—</p>
               <p>"Why, because mother and Emma"—the latter was young Hawley's wife—"were called away to see old Mrs. Darling"—she was an aged lady who lived some squares distant, and for whom the Hawley family professed a strong liking—"who is said to be dying. Poor old soul, she has had another attack of rheumatism in the stomach. The doctor didn't think that she could possibly survive it this time. The folks went, of course; and as they didn't get back in time, and it was impossible to tell how late their visit might be prolonged, I secured the services of this man—whom I know—and here I am."</p>
               <p>"Poor old Mrs. Darling," exclaimed Madelon, sympathetically. "How I pity her! A dear, good, old soul, whose loss many will have reason to deplore. Somebody<pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC5820-00000078"/> body get my hood and shawl—quick! I'll be ready in a few moments, cousin Charley!"</p>
               <p>The priest, during this conversation, had remained as immoveable as a statue; but as Madelon concluded, he breathed a sigh of relief. The girl's words re-assured him.</p>
               <p>My excuse was a plausible one, and, you will admit, admirably conceived; though a baser lie the brain of man could not well have concocted. The girl's suspicion—if indeed it had reached that point, was at once allayed, as her subsequent remark fully betokened. The excuse was perfectly natural, too; and, to that may be attributed its complete success.</p>
               <p>You must bear in mind that during this interview we in the hack could hardly be seen by those standing in the ball; while they, in consequence of the light behind them could, be pretty well distinguished by us. At the same time the misty barrier of falling snow-flakes contributed its share towards obscuring the prospect of both parties. But of the two we had a decided advantage. At the best they could but see the mere outlines of my form, while we were enabled, though indistinctly, to observe every movement which they made.</p>
               <p>During this time some three or four men and boys had passed up and down the street, all—except one little fellow who wished that he had a carriage to take him home—without so much as even looking at us. The sight was nothing unusual, and it was quite enough for them to do to make their way against the storm.</p>
               <p>In a few moments the domestic re-appeared with Madelon's equipments.</p>
               <p>The party, in the mean time, had withdrawn a little further into the hall, and the old folks, having bidden their guest "good night," had retired into the parlor.</p>
               <p>Frank, and his sister, and Madelon, were now alone, the domestics having also cleared the hall at the moment the old folks retired.</p>
               <p>The priest now bent over towards the door of the vehicle.</p>
               <p>"Hist! they are talking!" he whispered, catching me by the arm. "Listen!"</p>
               <p>I bent down and turned my ear towards the door of the house.</p>
               <p>Some indifferent conversation ensued between the three in relation to a return of the visit, when the two girls whispered each other "good night." Then their hands were clasped; and their lips met in a<pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC5820-00000079"/> parting salutation. And then there was another kiss and a manly voice, exclaimed,—</p>
               <p>"Good night, dear Madelon, and may God have you in His care forever and ever. Ere long, sweet, we shall not meet to part thus. The day of our happiness—of our joy, is yet to come. A little while and your home shall be mine—your friends mine—your enemies mine. Good night! Good night!"</p>
               <p>The Jesuit's breath came thick and fast; and even in the darkness, I could see his black eyes sparkle fiercely. "What sort of man is this?"—I wondered, in my own mind, as I involuntarily shrank at his fierce look.</p>
               <p>"As I imagined, Joseph," he whispered. "The lover—we have him! Maledictions on him! but his fist is heavy, as I have reason to know."</p>
               <p>The party now moved towards the door, and I thought it best that I should again be heard.</p>
               <p>"Come, Madelon, make haste! and Frank, you rascal, don't you detain her!" I cried. "It may be fine fun for you folks, standing there in the hall, but it's mighty dull sport to me out here. Why I'm almost frozen to an icicle. If I had imagined that you were going to be so long, I should have ventured out in the first place, rather than sit here. Ugh!"</p>
               <p>Five minutes before I should not have dared to make that observation.</p>
               <p>"Keep your temper, Charley, and remember, that you were once a young man yourself," cried Frank, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Yes; but even then I had some consideration for others beside myself," I rejoined, in a jesting tone. "So, none of your jokes at my expense. Remember, I am six months your senior, and <choice>
                     <sic>consesequently</sic>
                     <corr>consequently</corr>
                  </choice> have a right to some respect."</p>
               <p>"Now, cousin Charley, only don't grumble,"—chimed in Madelon—"and I promise, when we get home, to mix you a bowl of the excellent tea, which good Mrs. Sinclair recommended."</p>
               <p>"O, confound your tea!" I exclaimed, apparently half in jest, and half in earnest. "I'll have none of it; and if I get worse, I shall hold somebody responsible, that's all!"</p>
               <p>While yet I was speaking, Madelon began to descend the steps, young Sinclair close beside her, covering her with an umbrella. Anna remained standing in the door, and both the girls continued to chatter away like two magpies. Patrick, with<pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC5820-00000080"/> a forethought that betokened a familiarity with such scenes, drew the collar of his great coat close up around his face, in such a manner as to completely conceal it from view. The priest crouched yet closer in the dark coroner, and I turned my face rather more towards the interior of the vehicle. We were thus pretty effectually shaded from view.</p>
               <p>Madelon and Frank had reached the door of the hack, and the girl's foot was upon the bottom-step.</p>
               <p>If she had but looked within!—but why speculate?—her mind was too deeply absorbed in other matters, and too free from suspicion to pursue such a course. Turning round towards the house—thus presenting her back to the priest and myself—she cheerfully bade Anna and Frank "good night," at the same time shaking hands with the latter.</p>
               <p>Then disengaging herself from the embrace of her lover, she quickly entered the vehicle, and Patrick seizing the door, interposed his form between it and Frank, who was thus compelled to draw back a step or two.</p>
               <p>"Good night, all!" I cried, quickly, and while yet Madelon was getting in.</p>
               <p>"Good night!" returned Frank and his sister, in the same breath.</p>
               <p>"Be careful of Madelon, for my sake," continued the former.</p>
               <p>All this transpired before Madelon had attempted to seat herself, or had had an opportunity of observing anything in particular; not occupying as much time as I have been in telling it. It took but a moment, seemingly.</p>
               <p>The last words had not yet fallen from the lips of young Sinclair, and the dress of Madelon had barely disappeared within the vehicle, when Patrick closed the door, and leaped upon his seat, with the agility of a monkey.</p>
               <p>At the same instant the girl discovered her error—at a glance seemed to comprehend the trap into which she had fallen, and her danger. She would have screamed, but the priest quickly encircled her with his arms, and placing his handkerchief to her face, she sank down, speechless and insensible.</p>
               <p>"What have you done to her?" I inquired, quickly.</p>
               <p>"Nothing that, will harm her," he answered, hastily. "The handkerchief is saturated with a drug which once inhaled, produces instantaneous stupefaction. <emph>We</emph> have many such useful secrets. I knew that it would be needed, and so prepared myself. What would have been the consequence<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC5820-00000081"/> just this moment, but for my forethought? Why, we should both of us, probably, have occupied a prison's cell long before morning. But now, all is secure, and Madelon will not awake before to-morrow."</p>
               <p>At the moment the girl fell into unconsciousness, and previous to the passage of the foregoing remarks, the vehicle drove off, leaving Anna standing in the door, and Frank about half way up the steps, neither of them dreaming of the villainous outrage to which they had been unconscious witnesses.</p>
               <p>Patrick perfectly understood now what was required at his hands; and while in sight of the house drove along at what might be supposed a very natural rate of speed; but immediately upon turning the corner into the next street he lashed his horses up, and dashed on as fast as the snow would permit.</p>
               <p>Thus we proceeded for a considerable distance, the silence only once broken, and then by Father Huestace.</p>
               <p>"Was I not a prophet, Joseph?" he demanded. exultingly.</p>
               <p>"Even so, your reverence," I replied, briefly, and nothing more was said.</p>
               <p>Finally, the direction we were taking led me to inquire our destination.</p>
               <p>"To my house, of course," the priest replied, in a quick whisper, as if he feared that the poor, insensate girl reposing in his arms, had yet the power to betray him.</p>
               <p>Although not previously, I now began, in my own mind, to question the propriety of this step. "If indeed,"—I thought—"his object is principally, as he has expressed it, to remove her from her Protestant friends, and their influence, why not conceal her in the nunnery, a much more secret and suitable place, and far more safe for the girl." These reflections wound up with the very natural question, which I put mentally, to myself, but could not satisfactorily answer;—"Does he design her any personal violence or outrage?"</p>
               <p>At length I ventured to remark, referring to my previous question, and the Jesuit's reply,</p>
               <p>"Is it prudent your reverence? May you not be discovered?"</p>
               <p>The last half of my question was prompted, not so much from the fear it, expressed, as from a desire to conceal the motive of my inquiry.</p>
               <p>"Discovered! No!" responded the priest, with abrupt<pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC5820-00000082"/> rupt sternness. "Ere this people have died there, as you well know, and the world outside has been none the wiser. And if I were discovered, it would be but by those who would <emph>fear</emph> to speak of what they had seen—almost to think of it. For the prudence of such a course, Joseph, I only am responsible. For yourself, work and question not; then we are safe."</p>
               <p>I thought that from his decision, outrageous as it might be, there was no appeal, and so said no more. Fear of the priest, and a deep adherance to the Church, for a time made me a very pliant tool.</p>
               <p>After that we both continued silent for the remainder of the ride.</p>
               <p>At length we arrived in the vicinity of the church; but instead of proceeding to the front entrance, Patrick drove up the small street in the rear, and stopped a little south of the back entrance, which, as have before remarked, was through the graveyard. The snow, which was now pretty deep, prevented the approach of the vehicle from being heard. Even had it been otherwise, it would scarcely have excited curiosity, as the street contained but a small number of little, rickety tenements, which were inhabited by a brood of squalid, ignorant Irish, any one of whom would have assisted the priest in carrying rying out whatever scheme he might have proposed. Thus did everything conspire to favor the Jesuit's desires, and contribute its mite towards his success.</p>
               <p>Patrick quietly alighted from his seat, and for some moments stood perfectly still, cautiously looking down towards the large thoroughfare, from which we had turned, when we entered the cross-street we were then in.</p>
               <p>At length, apparently, assured by his scrutiny, he gently threw open the door of the hack, and whispered to the priest;—</p>
               <p>"All right, ye'r riverence; I don't see that anybody's followed us, an the shanties hereabouts are all dark and quiet. Bedad it couldn't be more still if the people was all dead."</p>
               <p>"Are you <emph>sure</emph> there is no skulking spy about? Look again!" said the Jesuit.</p>
               <p>Patrick turned from the vehicle, and again peered up and down the street.</p>
               <p>"All right again," he continued, once more advancing to the door. "Not a sowl to be seen!"</p>
               <p>At that moment the numerous clocks of the city pealed forth the passing hour—the church-bell mingling its sonorous chime in the general chorus; while from the adjoining street rose up the watchman's cry Of "O, pa' 'leven o' clock."</p>
               <pb n="160-161" xml:id="VAC5820-00000083"/>
               <p>Without a word further, the Jesuit shifted the inanimate girl from his own into my arms, and alighted; then taking her again from my hands, he directed me to put on his cloak, which he had dropped from his shoulders—ride off a square or two—then alight, and return on foot to the front of the church, and enter the building in that way.</p>
               <p>I nodded acquiescence; and then the priest—for he was a strong, athletic man—darted, quickly through the gate and disappeared. Madelon's weight did not seem to incommode him in the least.</p>
               <p>His object in directing me as stated was, doubtless, that if seen, I should be mistaken for himself; a very natural error, you will observe, consider the lateness and darkness of the hour, and that I was enveloped in his great black cloak. And thus, should any one observe me, thinking it was him—which he, doubtless hoped for—arriving on foot and without any burthen, it would go far to exculpate him in the event of anything leading to discovery.</p>
               <p>Ten minutes after the Jesuit had quitted the vehicle—Patrick, having performed all that was required of him at that time, and vanished—the priest and myself stood face to face in his gloomy library.</p>
               <p>I could not help fancying the apartment more dull and prison-like than usual. It was but a fancy, doubtless; but conceit, 'tis said, is often a bad as consumption. The light seemed to burn dimmer; and, notwithstanding the room was agreeably warm, no cheerful blaze relieved its comfortless aspect, for the building was heated throughout by a furnace in the cellar.</p>
               <p>I gazed around expecting to see Madelon—but I was disappointed.</p>
               <p>"Where is she?" I inquired, fixing my eyes upon the priest, who stood before me, calm and triumphant.</p>
               <p>Without opening his lips further than to admit of the play of a slight smile, Father Huestace walked across the room to the upper side-wall, and touching a secret spring—concealed in what I supposed to be a solid wall, but what in reality was but a wood partition—one of the apparent panels—the partition was so painted—flew-open, discovering a small, but neatly furnished apartment, beyond.</p>
               <p>I was somewhat astonished, though not probably to the extent that you and many others would have been; for I was well acquainted with all the intricacies of Catholic buildings, and knew that most of them contained some secret not generally public.</p>
               <p>The concealed door being open, the priest turned<pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC5820-00000084"/> round and beckoned me to follow him. I did so; and together we entered the apartment.</p>
               <p>Upon a single bed, in one corner of the room, reposed the form of a woman—and that woman, as you will readily imagine, was Madelon Hawley.</p>
               <p>She was still insensible.</p>
               <p>Together we walked to the bed-side, and together gazed down upon the unconscious sleeper, standing in such a position that the light front the outer room would strike full upon her exquisitely fair, but now pale face. Her bonnet, shawl, and other cumbrous articles had been removed; her position was easy, natural, and unrestrained; and her whole appearance irresistibly innocent and lovely.</p>
               <p>"Beautiful, is she not?" demanded the priest, looking up front the girl's face to mine. "Wonderously beautiful, or my judgment has grown feeble. Not all Europe, and in my time I have penetrated its remotest depths, could furnish a more surpassing picture of womanly loveliness. And she is mine—mine at last!"</p>
               <p>At these last words the priest's dark face, rapidly underwent a change; and then across his hard features flashed the shadow of many passions, which the words had conjured up in his corrupted soul. I read them all, and involuntarily shuddered at the dark review. Triumph, hate, lust, avarice—O, it was a strange association—an inexplicable combination.</p>
               <p>"But you have not answered me, Joseph," he continued, after a moment. "Do you not think Madelon beautiful?"</p>
               <p>"Beautiful, indeed!" I murmured, with my gaze again fixed upon the marble face of the sleeper. "And as pure in heart as she is beautiful in person. Like her mother, in mind and feature, it is said."</p>
               <p>The last words fell from my lips unthinkingly, and their effect was instantaneous. The priest, rendered suspicious by his evil deeds, doubtless fancied a taunt in the thoughtless expression; and though indeed I had begun to weary of his complicated crime, I had yet a powerful fear of incurring his hate by any such a course.</p>
               <p>Quick as the lightning's flash his eyes were riveted upon my face, and the expression of his countenance was appalling.</p>
               <p>"She does, indeed, resemble her mother, Joseph!" he hissed, and his breast was surging with the wildest emotions. "But <emph>why</emph> remind me of it?"—<pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC5820-00000085"/>
                  <emph>why</emph> rouse from their far depths thoughts and associations, which at this moment more than any other for long years, madden me?—<emph>why</emph>, with the pale face of that girl—from which her dead mother seems to look—here before me, do you conjure up that bitter past? that past, which witnessed the destruction of all my wild love, and the humiliation of my burning heart? Why do you do this? Think you that my hatred has burnt itself out, or that I waver in my purpose?"</p>
               <p>A terrible thought flashed through my mind.</p>
               <p>"You will not harm <emph>her</emph>?" I demanded, pointing to Madelon. "You promised not to!"</p>
               <p>"Harm <emph>her</emph>!" he exclaimed, with intense passion; and then suddenly, and with an effort, checking himself, he resumed in quite a different tone, strongly in contrast with his former manner;—"no, no, no; not to me must <emph>she</emph> answer; but to the Church must her atonement be made—the Church whom she has offended, and whose humble instrument I am."</p>
               <p>As sudden as was the change in the priest's words, so sudden, to outward appearances at least, was the expression of his feelings. His towering passion—his intense excitement, were gone, and a calm and quiet demeanor had usurped their place. I looked and wondered, but nevertheless doubted; and I have often thought since, politic as he was, that he changed his manner merely to allay my fears, and not that he believed what he uttered.</p>
               <p>"That Church, to whom <emph>all</emph> who offend, must answer"—he continued; "that Church whose arm can reach the uttermost corners of the earth, and whose eye can read the human heart—that Church who knows no distinction between the <emph>priest</emph> and the layman, when her sovereign will is questioned, or her mandates disobeyed—that Church who has the power to <emph>compel</emph> submission, and whose superiors, the world over are directed to send refractory brethren to Pontifical Rome, there to learn what most becomes them—unquestioned and implicit obedience."</p>
               <p>To one standing in the inferior position in which I did, there was a terrible meaning in the Jesuit's calm and unimpassioned words, as he well knew, and therefore uttered the hidden threat. I felt anxious at that moment, to conciliate him, and consequently—not from love, but from fear—endeavored to correct the impulsive speech which had so arouse his terrible passions. At length he appeared really satisfied.</p>
               <p>"Enough, enough, my good Joseph!" he exclaimed, at length interrupting me in what I am now convinced<pb n="166-167" xml:id="VAC5820-00000086"/> vinced was a very awkward attempt at explanation. "You, doubtless, meant no harm, and I was excited and hasty. There are moments in the life of every human being, when they will be betrayed into some hasty word or act—and we are but human at last. Let it pass. But come,"—he continued, quietly drawing the counterpane over Madelon, and turning towards the door—"let us leave this. Other thoughts now demand our attention."</p>
               <p>We then re-entered the library, the priest lingering last, and closing the panel behind him as he passed through.</p>
               <p>By this time I was thoroughly mystified with the priest's conduct. I could not decide what was really the motive that led him on. That, his service to the Church, of which he so much vaunted, was but a cloak, I was almost certain; but whether he coveted the girl or her money most; or whether an abiding hatred for the mother, who had scorned him, induced him thus to persecute her image, I was at a loss, up to that time, at least, to decide. I could not analyze his conduct, it was such a strange mixture of baseness, hypocrisy and deceit. He talked fairly—sometimes beautifully—always eloquently; and so concealed much of the corruption, that was festering beneath. What his tongue uttered, was plain; but what his heart felt, was as deeply, hidden as the mystery of the grave.</p>
               <p>Once or twice about this—period and some such thought entered my mind while standing there over Madelon—I had really contemplated the chance of shaking off the service of the Jesuit; but the spectre <emph>Fear</emph>, grim and gaunt, quickly crushed out the vivid thought. He was old and powerful in the good-will of our superiors, while <emph>I</emph>was weak, insignificant, and uninfluential. To whom under such circumstances could I turn? To the Church? She would laugh at, and disbelieve me. To the world at large? Little credit or sympathy would I get there; while in either case, I should risk a sudden death, or a life-long imprisonment in the dark cells of the Inquisition.</p>
               <p>You wonder! If not in this land, in Catholic Europe, at least, that dark blot upon humanity still flourished—flourished, too, in all its pristine and terrible horror, notwithstanding Pius the Sixth once assured Napoleon, that it was no longer what it had been—no longer a tribunal of religious opinion. What more easy matter, than to send me to Rome, as others, under somewhat similar circumstances, had been sent before? Besides, in exposing Father Huestace,<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC5820-00000087"/> but denounced myself, and brought down the vengeance of the out-raged laws upon my own head. What could I do but go on?</p>
               <p>But to proceed.</p>
               <p>We had re-entered the library, you remember; and although but a few moments had elapsed since the priest and myself had jangled, he <emph>seemed</emph> to have forgotten—for I did not believe that he really had—the occurrence entirely.</p>
               <p>Seating himself in his huge arm-chair, and briefly bidding me follow his example, he proceeded to address me as follows; and his tone and manner was as quiet and subdued, as if he had never done a wrong to any human being—as if every act of his life had been above reproach or condemnation.</p>
               <p>"Joseph," said he, as soon as we were seated—"there, doubtless, will be much excitement in relation to this outrage—to-morrow's papers will herald it; particularly, as the lady and her friends are among the wealthiest and proudest in the city. Were she but a poor wench, with a few friends and no influence, it <emph>might</emph> be otherwise, even in this democratic republic. In the present case, however, all that money, and position can accomplish, will be brought into requisition. Nor will the matter be bettered, should anything lead the people—the rabble are always excitable and easily influenced—to conjecture that <emph>we</emph> had a hand in it. Let them but once think so, and I doubt, if there is a building in the city, or a law in the land, that would save us from their wrath. Under such circumstances, we must be more cautious; more bold; more firm. And to encourage and assure us, we have the conviction, that our plans have been so well arranged, and so skilfully executed, that they would defy the inquisitor-general himself to penetrate them. Should they <emph>suspect</emph>—which they possibly may, for they have good reason—they cannot accuse, not having any direct proof. <emph>You</emph> will not, and Patrick <emph>dare</emph> not, betray me, and through me the Church, and through the Church your <emph>souls</emph>. For Madelon—there"—he pointed towards the panel—"she is as securely hidden as though she were in her grave. Save ourselves, no one in this city is aware of the existence of that room, and were they, without the secret of the spring, which is intricate, they could not effect an entrance. And that the girl herself may not have the least chance of involving us, I will keep her senses so steeped in oblivion—at all times, except when it is absolutely necessary that she should take food, and then I myself will be present<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC5820-00000088"/> to guard against accidents—that she will neither be able, short of a miracle, to move or speak. I can do it, Joseph, and yet not kill her. If we were not seen when we entered here—and it is hardly possible that we were—all is safe. In that respect we did our best—we could, indeed, do no more. And now, Joseph, home; but bear in mind, that in this hour more than ever, there is need of a close mouth, a quick eye, and a firm heart. Good night; and may the Holy Virgin guard your slumbers."</p>
               <p>A few moments after I quitted the room and emerged into the street; and despite the stormy condition of the weather, and the dreariness of everything around, I experienced a relief, which not even the cold, keen, blast, could damp.</p>
               <p>A little later, and sleep had bound my weary eyes; but in consequence of the disordered condition of my mind, my slumber was much broken by frightful visions; and in the morning I arose at a much later hour than usual, languid and unrefreshed.</p>
               <p>For a half hour previous to arising I lay awake, thinking; not so much, however, about Madelon, as of what concerned myself. The girl under the protection of the Church, my duty of spy, at, least, was <choice>
                     <sic>ta</sic>
                     <corr>at</corr>
                  </choice> an end. Under those circumstances I did not think it necessary, or even advisable, to remain longer in the position I occupied. It was not likely, I argued, that I should remain much longer in the city, and for the time that would intervene prior to my departure, I could find lodgings at some Inn. Having arrived at that conclusion, I arose and sought the master of the house.</p>
               <p>Mr. Ellis was kind, but strict; and I easily saw, upon entering his presence, that he was not over pleased at my laziness, as he bluntly termed it. I heard him through,and then excused myself on the plea of indisposition, announcing to him in the same connection, my intention of leaving his employment, and shortly, the city. He then complimented me upon my general good conduct, and attention to his business, during the short time I had been with him—expressed a regret at my leaving, and a cordial wish for my future prosperity I thanked him kindly, and then took my leave; carefully avoiding even the chance of encountering Winnie, or any one else; though I felt well assured, that in no quarter was suspicion attached to me. I had always been too guarded.</p>
               <p>During the afternoon and evening of that same day, I called twice at the priest's residence, but on<pb n="172-173" xml:id="VAC5820-00000089"/> each occasion he was absent on particular business as the old housekeeper informed me. That was all I could learn, and so was obliged to be content.</p>
               <p>As the priest had predicted, the excitement in consequence of the abduction, was of a most alarming character. The full particulars of the affair, in some respects highly exaggerated, had been published that morning in all the daily papers, and the story had spread like wildfire. The papers, after detailing the principal features, went on to state, that the imposition had been discovered by the arrival of the real Charles Hawley, but a short time subsequent to the departure of the fictitious one. Immediate search was instituted, and the whole city scoured as so on as possible, but without discovering any trace of the young lady or her captors. All, in the concluding words of one of the most influential journals of the day, was shrouded in impenetrable mystery; but the whole affair was instantly to undergo a thorough and strict investigation, that the outraged laws might be appeased, and the happiness of a numerous and influential family once more restored.</p>
               <p>And thus was chronicled another of those crimes, which long since rendered the Romish Church notorious—which centuries ago, made black and fearful both the public and private history of her priesthood. Read there—if your eyes do not pale—the terrible catalogue of crimes which have been, year by year, heaping up against the mother at whose fount these children of sin and corruption have been nurtured.</p>
               <p>Yes, go read the history of her private, individual murders, and her public and general massacres! Go, count if you can, the old men and the matrons, the young men and the maidens, and the children, who have suffered by her hypocrisy, endured her tortures, and died at her reeking hands. Penetrate into the cells of her Inquisition—examine all her fiendish instruments of torture—behold her heartless and despotic judges, and hearken to her justice! Justice! Romish justice! God forgive me, what a mockery!</p>
               <p>O, could the dead in Time's great graveyard, burst their bonds of clay and stand up before us now, what a huge mountain of evidence would overwhelm this Dragon of the earth. O, but there would be shrieks and groans, terrible and fearful, ascending up, and up, filling the vast earth below, and the great heavens above. O, but there would be curses deep, and bitter, heaped upon her guilty head. There would be told tales of murder—of robbery—of adultery; of<pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC5820-00000090"/> mercy denied, and prayers unheeded, could the unnumbered dead of ages gone, thus stand around us, and communicate the secrets of their lives. It would be a jubilee of terrible sounds.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>THE following was the Sabbath day; and as the church bells pealed forth their matin call, I repaired to the priest's house; partly from custom—partly from an irrepressible desire to be near the spot where Madelon was hidden, and partly from a wish to learn what Father Huestace was thinking and doing.</p>
               <p>The priest greeted my appearance as if nothing unusual had occurred; and, after a few unimportant remarks, expressed a desire, that I should be ready to confer with him that evening after service, as until that time the duties of the church claimed his undivided attention. At that hint I departed—he never permitted any person whatever to remain in his library, when he himself was not present—glad to get away, for a time at least, from the narrow limits of a place that conjured up such painful thoughts.</p>
               <p>As the last echo of the pealing bell mingled with<pb n="176-177" xml:id="VAC5820-00000091"/> the loud swell of the great organ, I passed from the priest's library round to the front of the church, and mingling with the worshippers, entered the building. The audience were mostly arranged in their seats; and as I gazed down from the gallery, where I had stationed myself, upon the hundreds of upturned faces, I fancied that I could trace in each gaping countenance only ignorance, grossness, superstition, and bigotry.</p>
               <p>Away over in one corner sat Patrick, the hackman; and there was not a more, devout worshipper in the building; and yet there was blood upon his hands, and murder on his soul. And as still I gazed around upon the throng of bigoted slaves, I wondered in my own mind how many others in that vast assembly were marked with the same brand—how much crime, and shame, and hypocrisy, was crowded beneath that lofty dome.</p>
               <p>Romanism was not then—is not now—and never will be, more of a credit, or a profit, or a blessing, to this country than it has ever been to any other; and wherever it has secured power, which it is continually aiming at, ignorance, superstition, bigotry, and crime, have run wild.</p>
               <p>Of such things has been its past—of such are its present—of such will be its future. Better there were future for it, in this country, then might America become entirely free—entirely republican; but while that incubus rests upon her great heart, and with its rank poison impermeates every artery of her system, that result can never be achieved—for catholicism is inimical to republicanism. The subject of the Pope, which every true Catholic is, beyond the shadow of a doubt, cannot become the honest and loyal subject of a Protestant republic; for in all things his allegiance to the Church is paramount, and most binding.</p>
               <p>Turn to the pages of ancient and modern history, and your heart will quake with the long record of her exclusiveness—her tyranny—her extortion—her proscription. Proscription! cries some zealous bigot, superstitiously blind. Yes! Has not the Roman Catholic Church forever and ever looked upon all outside her slavish influence as damnable heretics? looked upon them as the ferocious wolf does upon the lamb—as legitimate prey? Has she not continually, at all times, and in all places, hunted them in the most fierce, and frequently, fatal manner? And has she not always, and does she not still, grasp at universal dominion? And to accomplish that end,<pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC5820-00000092"/> think you she would pause at any crime—any horror? No! no! If she would, all her antecedents lie.</p>
               <p>Her principles—if her crime, her shame, her superstition, her imposture, can be called principles—are still the same, although the progress of education and enlightenment have somewhat modified her deeds, at least in this country. Her bigotry—her assumption—her arrogance—her proscription—her accursed exclusiveness, are still the same, though externally adapted to the circumstances which surround her.</p>
               <p>Why, the Catholic religion—the creed of the Pope, and the Church of Rome—the faith beneath whose banner thousands upon thousands of human beings have been butchered in cold blood, is fast becoming one of the most prominent things in this republic; and even here, as in the God-deserted countries where it is religion, law, and everything else, its-ministers would, if they but dare, and will, if they ever can, put <emph>you</emph> to the torture for expressing an opinion contrary to the heathenish creed which they inculcate. These are facts which cannot be contradicted.</p>
               <p>Those who have studied much, and read much, and observed much, have prophesied a great battle in the future—a battle between two huge armies, which shall fight beneath the red banner of Catholicism, and the white flag of Protestantism; a battle—not with the tongue, not with the pen, not with the ballot, but with the rattling musket and bashing sword.</p>
               <p>Do not passing events seem to indicate some such result? Has not riot, and civil war, and blood, and fire, already sprung up in the path of this insatiate beast? Will not such a course, appalling as it may seem, some day become a necessity, and be the only alternative left to check the swift progress of this destroying Juggernaut—to diminish the rapid strides with which it now encircles the land? 'The heart of Rome is large enough to take in the whole world,' and she will not lose any opportunity to fill up the vacuum. Upon America her eager eye has long been fixed, and some day you must either accept her slavery, directly or indirectly, or unite to crush her power. Can any one doubt it?</p>
               <p>But again I wander, and weary myself and you, with prosy speculations and unavailing denunciations—again my present feelings have led me away from the thread of my narrative. To return once again!</p>
               <p>From the audience I turned my eyes to Father Huestace. A prayer was trembling on his lips. As I gazed upon his unruffled brow, and listened to<pb n="180-181" xml:id="VAC5820-00000093"/> his calm, and at that moment, not unmusical voice, I wondered, too, how he could be so strong, and firm, while yet that pale girl, so still and motionless, was wasting her strength away in that little room, within a few yards of where he knelt.</p>
               <p>Filled with such thoughts and feelings, all things about me grew irksome, and at length I quietly arose from my seat and left the building. Free air changed the current of my thoughts, and not wishing to leave the neighborhood, I strolled into an Inn, a few doors distant, and taking up a paper, seated myself. I could not read, however, for many persons were present, and all were busy with surmises, as to the cause, and speculations as to the probable issue, of the recent abduction. I made believe to peruse the paper that was before me, but my whole mind was intent upon what was being said around me. Loud and bitter were the curses heaped upon the perpetrators, whoever they were—unsparing the denunciations which passed rapidly from mouth to mouth. Many, too, were the suggestions which were made as to the character of those, who were, doubtless, engaged in the outrage; and the most favored supposition seemed to be, that it was the work of the Roman Catholics.</p>
               <p>Little did they dream, how near the truth they were in that conclusion little did they imagine what an intimate connection I had with the subject of their conversation. Had they been conscious of the latter, they doubtless would have lynched me upon the spot; for they all appeared to be Americans and Protestants. I trembled at the thought, and finally glided, unperceived, from the room.</p>
               <p>Morning, and afternoon, and evening service were all over, and still I lingered in the vicinity of the church. The place had a peculiar sort of fascination for me. I could not leave it, even when I wanted to; and there was not the least occasion for my remaining in the neighborhood the whole day.</p>
               <p>Darkness at length came—the early evening service was over, and I glided along the avenue, and into the priest's house. He was awaiting me.</p>
               <p>"Good evening, Joseph," he said. "Take a seat. I have been looking for you for some time; though I suppose it is my own impatience that has made the period tedious. I <emph>am</emph>, doubtless, a little eager in this matter, of Madelon, for one is not likely to learn patience in sixteen years of disappointment. But never mind that, Joseph, for we<pb n="182-183" xml:id="VAC5820-00000094"/> have yet much to do—we are not yet out of the woods. We must advance with our work, and speedily; for the girl's disappearance has become notoriously public, and the excitement, instead of abating, but increases. One of yesterday's papers—the editor of which appears to be somewhat conversant with Madelon's history—contained a statement of the persecutions to which, it is rumored, she has been subjected; and suggests that the present outrage <emph>may</emph> have been committed by her old enemies, the Papists. That is enough for the heretic Yankees. A mite of proof would now work our destruction in earnest—would set a conflagration we could not easily quench."</p>
               <p>"It is all so, your reverence," I answered calmly; not at all surprised at what he said.</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> take it cool <emph>now</emph>, Joseph!" said Father Huestace, looking up into my face, astonished, and emphasizing his words strongly.</p>
               <p>"And why not, your reverence,"—I rejoined,—"since I am so familiar with to what you tell me? My first alarm, too, is over."</p>
               <p>"Right—right, my good Joseph!" said Father Huestace, recollecting himself. "But you, doubtless, have heard much more than I have myself. What say you? Is not the public agitated?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," I continued; "for although such a little time has elapsed, the story is in everybody's mouth. I have been in and out among the people since yesterday, and have heard all their surmises and suspicions. They point, all, to the Church."</p>
               <p>"Our path darkens, Joseph!" cried the priest, with a slight show of nervous superstition. "I'll can see the black shadow as it creeps down before me. Madelon must be got away, and immediately. I will not even risk the possibility of being discovered and defeated. Madelon <emph>must</emph> be got away!"</p>
               <p>"But how?" I inquired. "I should think that during the present excitement any attempt to remove the girl would be dangerous."</p>
               <p>"Nevertheless, Joseph, she must be got away,"—continued the Jesuit, determinedly. "The necessity is apparent and unanswerable. How it is to be accomplished I have not yet thought—I only know that it <emph>must</emph> be done; and if I devise not a scheme, it is the first time my brain has ever failed me. But there is not another must be looked after. The lover, my good Joseph, the lover! 'Twould be dangerous to leave the city with him<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC5820-00000095"/> in it, for the ingenuity of love can scarcely be equalled. With the information which he already, doubtless, possesses, as a guide, he would soon ferret something out; soon prove himself a strong and dangerous enemy—more so than all the rest combined. Unquestionably, Madelon has favored him with a minute history of every circumstance. 'Twould be folly to think otherwise. Something, therefore, must be done to keep him quiet—that is certain. But what is really best, puzzles me considerably. I am yet at a loss. Besides we are terribly environed by the girl's friends and relations. I can see it, though I hate to acknowledge the fact."</p>
               <p>"Why not then, your reverence," I demanded—"renounce all thought of young Sinclair? Others are almost, if not quite, as active and dangerous. Besides one scheme may interfere with the other, and in the end defeat what is already accomplished."</p>
               <p>"I admit the truth of all you say, Joseph," responded the Jesuit. "Your arguments are not new to me, and sometimes I have been tempted to forego every consideration but the one grand object of securing Madelon."</p>
               <p>The Jesuit was again playing with my credulity—again deceiving me into the belief that his hate for Frank Sinclair was not hate, but simply a desire, natural enough, to guard against the chance of discovery. At the same time a fearful scheme was working in his brain, as you shall see; but not considering, I suppose, either my consent or assistance necessary, he was taking this method of keeping me in the dark. With him life was one continuous plot—a tissue of deceit and treachery.</p>
               <p>"I agree with you entirely, Joseph," he continued, coming round suddenly to my views. "Our scheme <emph>scarcely</emph> requires these measures; and yet I had a small account to settle with this same Frank Sinclair;" and almost unconsciously, as I could see, the Jesuit set his teeth. "But we must learn to forego our own pleasure, when the prosperity of the Church demands a sacrifice, as it does in this case. But I will think it over again. I have thought all along that it were best to adopt some measures in relation to the lover, and so have expressed myself to you. I am <emph>partly</emph> incline to think so still. However, I will give the matter a deep and final consideration. Should circumstances demand the removal of young Sinclair, I shall not hesitate in the course marked out for me; should it be otherwise, I shall be equally as<pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC5820-00000096"/> prompt in following an opposite direction. I do not—from various causes—like the young man; but never shall the gratification of may feelings clash with the well-being of my religion, or prove a stumbling-block in the triumphant progress of the Church."</p>
               <p>All this rodomontade amounted to so many words and no more; for at that very moment the Jesuit was contemplating a deed of mere wanton revenge, which eminently endangered himself, myself, the Church, and all.</p>
               <p>"However, as I have said," he still continued "I will think the matter over calmly and dispassionately. Until we meet again, let it now rest. To-morrow morning call at Patrick's stand, and bid him wait upon me as soon after as possible. In the evening, early, come here yourself. By that time I shall have completed the preliminary arrangements for the removal of Madelon and shall be enabled to communicate further upon the subject. In the mean time watch around, and should you learn anything really essential, let me know it instantly."</p>
               <p>"I shall do so, your reverence," I responded, as I arose to my feet, and took up my hat. "Before I leave, however, I should like to inquire after the condition dition of Miss Hawley. Does she realize her position?"</p>
               <p>"She does not, I take it," replied Father Huestace. "Since she has been here, she has continued in a sort of stupor; the effect of the drugs which I have administered to her. In this condition she has only a kind of dream-life. Once, indeed, when I was giving her some food, she murmured; 'Frank, save me! save me!' That is the only evidence of real life she has so far displayed. But I am in hopes, shortly, to be able to release her mind from this torpid state."</p>
               <p>"I hope so, too," I responded. "Her present condition is but a slow torture. And now, your reverence, if you have nothing further to offer, I will take my leave."</p>
               <p>"Nothing further to night, Joseph," said the Jesuit. "Remember my directions, and be prompt. It is in that manner, we all prove ourselves."</p>
               <p>Then we parted, and each was alone with his own busy reflections.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>THE following morning I called upon the hackman, Patrick, and executed the priest's errand. What transpired at the interview between those two, I had but little suspicion of, and only learned from succeeding circumstances.</p>
               <p>At the designated hour in the evening I was again seated in the Jesuit's little den. After answering some questions which he proposed in relation to the feeling that still existed in the community, a pause ensued, which he broke in his usually abrupt manner.</p>
               <p>"I have had a visitor, to-day, Joseph," said he. "Whom do you suppose? But why ask? you could never imagine. Why, no less an individual, than Mr. Frank Sinclair, the ardent, passionate, devoted lover of Madelon—the youth who has not enough enemies of his own, but must glory in the acquisition of another's. Maledictions on the meddling heretic!"</p>
               <p>"Did he come here—<emph>here</emph>, your reverence?" I exclaimed, startled by the announcement. "Then, indeed, is danger near!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," continued Father Huestace, quickly working himself into a passion; "yes, he came here—<emph>here</emph> in this very house—came upon me almost unheralded, and abruptly demanded to know what I had done with his Madelon—where I had secreted the treasure I had stolen. I told him, that he was mistaken—that he wronged me—foully wronged me by his suspicions. He said, that it was false—false as my own black heart, for his Madelon had told him of me—told him, how that I would have wronged her mother—how that I would have killed <emph>her</emph>—how that I had ever sought to rob and wrong her, and was always her bitterest and most unrelenting foe."</p>
               <p>Thus talked the heretic fool; and still I told him, that he was wrong—and still he would not believe me, but threatened me over and over again with quick exposure, unless I discovered to him, where his Madelon was concealed—or pointed to her grave. Thus he raved and raved, and all the while his Madelon, whom he so bewailed, lay there"—with a look of<pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC5820-00000098"/> bitter hatred the priest pointed to the panel—"there, I say, within a few feet of the spot upon which he was standing. That was my triumph, Joseph, and the proud heretic's despair pleased me. Maledictions on him! Raving at me for a priestly villain, he left, roundly asseverating, that he would have the whole building searched before the world was a day older. Then, my good Joseph, I sat down and laughed heartily at the heretic's great agony. The fool! The fool! he has fixed his fate."</p>
               <p>"But, were you not frightened?" I inquired, alarmed myself, at our apparently imminent position.</p>
               <p>"Wherefore?" quoth the priest, scornfully.</p>
               <p>"The lover is maddened, and may—doubtless will—keep his threat," I responded.</p>
               <p>"And if he does, what then?" replied the Jesuit, defiantly. "Let him fetch a whole pack of the law's myrmidons—let them search the building from top to bottom, and the chances are ten to one, that they leave no wiser than they came. That room is too safe. And unless their movements are very, rapid, they will not find Madelon, even should they discover that apartment. One day more, land we may defy them."</p>
               <p>At that moment there was a low knocking at the library-door. I trembled like a thief caught in a felony.</p>
               <p>"Hush!" said the priest, and he drew close to the door.</p>
               <p>"Who knocks?" he inquired in low tones.</p>
               <p>"Me, Holy Father," answered the old housekeeper, in her thin and querulous tones. "Only me."</p>
               <p>"Well!" said the Jesuit, sharply.</p>
               <p>"A man, named Patrick, wishes to see your reverence," continued the old woman. "He is in haste."</p>
               <p>"Admit him, and then go to bed," exclaimed Father Huestace, quickly and peremptorily.</p>
               <p>In a few moments the hackman, Patrick, came staggering into the room—not, however, from, the effects of strong, drink, but from the effects, as it turned out, of apprehension. Throwing himself into a chair, he gazed around the apartment, fearfully and speechlessly. The silence which followed his entrance, was painful, to me at least, in the highest degree.</p>
               <p>Finally the priest walked close up to him, and shading his eyes with his hands looked him full in the face. Patrick's countenance was as pale and colorless as the white vestments of the grave.</p>
               <p>"It is accomplished!" exclaimed the Jesuit, as he<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC5820-00000099"/> turned away from the panting man he had been scrutinizing. "<emph>He</emph> will not trouble us again, Joseph!"</p>
               <p>"He? What he?" I inquired, bewildered by his enigmatic words.</p>
               <p>"Hist!" broke in Patrick, starting from his chair, and catching the priest by the skirt of his coat. "I want to spake to ye'r riverence. But, Howly Mother, are we alone? Won't I be heard?"</p>
               <p>The priest rested his hands upon the man's head, and addressed him with almost fatherly tenderness.—</p>
               <p>"Speak, Patrick, and as freely as if you were at the confessional," he said. "All here are bounden friends—friends in the good cause—and no one else can hear you. Let your words be what they may, you have nothing to fear, but every thing to hope for, from us. We are all alike servants of the Church."</p>
               <p>I shuddered; for I intuitively felt that a tale of blood was to be told. Everything denoted a deed of horror.</p>
               <p>Patrick cast another rapid and fearful glance around the dim apartment, and then drawing him self close up beside the Jesuit; he placed his mouth to his ear and whispered;—</p>
               <p>"He's dead—under the ice—gone—gone—forever!"</p>
               <p>An involuntary shudder, like an electric shock passed from one to the other of us. Even the scheming Jesuit, and the murderer, were unable to repress the evidence of their horror.</p>
               <p>Here the stimulating contents of the black bottle were brought in requisition. Father Huestace and myself having each tossed off a modicum—involuntarily I followed the Jesuit's lead—the priest addressed Patrick, who sat staring at us, and probably wondering whether he was to get any of that—to all such creatures as himself—great elixir—brandy.</p>
               <p>"Here, take a glass of this," said he, pouring out a tumbler full of the fiery liquid. "You are weak and nervous, Patrick—this will give you strength."</p>
               <p>"Ye may well say I'm wake, ye'r riverence," exclaimed Patrick, draining his glass, with a single breath. "It's wake ye'd be—it's wake inybody'd be if they'd seen, and heard, and dun what I have!"</p>
               <p>"Let this console you, Patrick," exclaimed the priest, cheeringly. "The Church commanded, and the Church shall absolve you."</p>
               <p>Direct reference was here made to something, but what, I did not then understand.</p>
               <p>It is thus that far too many of the Romish priests encourage sin, and shame, and crime—thus they bribe their tools to the commission of every<pb n="194-195" xml:id="VAC5820-00000100"/> description of villainy—thus they arrogate to themselves, that power of forgiveness which only the Divinity possesses.</p>
               <p>Then that man—that brutal wife-murderer—went on to relate his tale of terrible murder, while the fiend who had devised and instigated the fearful deed sat in his chair as immoveable as a marble statue. Yes, with coarse words he proceeded to tell how he had watched Frank Sinclair—for there the mystery lay—all the day long; how about dark he had met him, as if just by accident—how he put on a false face, and with a lying tongue, declared that he had been looking for him for a long while, for that he had news of the young lady who had been stolen away—that she was not dead, but imprisoned, and that he could lead him to where she was concealed, if he feared not to follow, and would be secret.</p>
               <p>At this point Patrick had somewhat recovered his hardihood, and become interested in his recital. And here he dwelt, particularly, upon the young man's agony and anxiety, as if he fancied that by so doing he would the better please the plotting and mendacious priest. And, doubtless, he did; but nevertheless <emph>I</emph> could have stricken him down, had I felt myself free to do so.</p>
               <p>Again he went on to tell how he had induced the frenzied youth to promise that he would meet him a few hours later at a low haunt upon the wharf; how he had obligated him—by the hope of finding his lost Madelon—not to communicate the circumstance to any one, and to come entirely alone armed to the teeth, if he pleased, but alone; how the delusive hope of saving the girl had induced the youth to pledge compliance with all these suspicious demands; and how he had come at the appointed hour, and fallen into the base and murderous trap which had been set for him.</p>
               <p>"I told him," said Patrick—(I cannot tell the story in the villain's peculiar diction, and therefore will not attempt it)—and a darker frown gathered upon his dark brow, and his hoarse whisper became deeper and intenser—"I told him, how, that on such a night, I had seen a carriage, containing a lady, pass that spot—we were standing, at the time, just beyond the Penn Treaty Tree—how the lady had screamed and struggled, as it passed by me—how the carriage was driven down upon the ice, and across to the other side—how I followed close behind, thinking that<pb n="196-197" xml:id="VAC5820-00000101"/> something was wrong—how the carriage stopped at the door of a lonely house on the Jersey side—I remembered it well—where the lady was compelled to alight and enter. I told him, all this and more, and the crazy fool believed every word. "I come for thee, Madelon!" he cried, and then like a maniac dashed out upon the ice. "Follow, friend, follow! follow! follow!" he continued to scream, as he rushed on, regardless of all danger. I did follow, your reverence, and soon coming up, kept close along by his side. And still on we went, us two lone men, running side by side, at the top of our speed. The night is dark, your reverence, dreadfully dark; and the madman dashed along scarcely looking whither he was going, except, that his steps conveyed him to the other side. I knew the path well, for I had selected it; during the afternoon, and I was more careful. I knew, what he did not, that close beside the path was a deceitful hole, into which he <emph>might</emph> fall"—the priest smiled, grimly—"if he wasn't more guarded; and so I kept closer by his side than before, that I might help him, if any unfortunate accident should happen."</p>
               <p>The hackman paused to gather breath.</p>
               <p>"That I was kind of you, Patrick," said Father Huestace, hypocritically; "very kind. Continue! Tell us, how the young man succeeded. I am interested; and, doubtless, Joseph is, too."</p>
               <p>I <emph>was</emph> interested; terribly, fearfully, painfully interested.</p>
               <p>"By-and-bye," continued Patrick—"we came near the weak and treacherous spot. I looked all around—up and down the river, and towards both shores, but I couldn't see anybody. I listened but I couldn't hear nothing except our own noise. All was dark, and still, and lonely. Just the right kind of a night for a man to slip under the ice, and nobody know nothing about it. And all the time the gentleman by my side kept on running with his eyes fixed right ahead, only once in a while shouting, "I come, Madelon, I come;" and all the time I kept shoulder to shoulder with him. In a little while we were within a few feet of the air-hole; and still the madman's eyes were fixed right ahead; in a little while more his feet were upon the crumbling ice. Then I stretched my mouth up to his ear, and whispered—"You will soon see your Madelon, friend!" "Madelon, dear Madelon!" he shouted; and then the ice cracked and broke beneath his feet, and he sank in the cold and freezing water. I started back quickly, for fear that I too might go under, and I had not bargained<pb n="198 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5820-00000102"/> gained for that. The drowning man caught at the thin ice with desperate energy, but the brittle stuff crumbled at his touch, and slid away. He called upon me to help him, for God's sake—offered me gold—wealth—but the ice was too thin to venture near, and no one else was by to help him. After a while he must have got weak and benumbed, for he suddenly sank out of sight beneath the ice, and I couldn't see him. any more. He died hard, hard, your reverence; for as he went under, he shrieked, terribly, fear—"</p>
               <p>At that moment a long, wild, terrific wail, echoed and re-echoed through out the house. It chilled the very blood in my veins. With the sound we all three started, and for a moment stood staring at each other. Patrick was the first to move. Sinking slowly down upon his knees, he crossed his breast, and began to mumble over quickly his <foreign xml:lang="LAT">aves</foreign> and <foreign xml:lang="LAT">paters.</foreign> The priest sprang from his seat, and while the hackman's head was bowed in fear, passed silently through the panel into the adjoining apartment. I looked on with dumb affright, for a moment almost expecting to behold another scene of violence and crime.</p>
               <p>In a few moments after the priest's disappearance,<figure>
                     <head>Drowning of Frank Sinclair.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="-199" xml:id="VAC5820-00000103"/> there was a slight struggle—a faint scream—a few muttered words, and all was quiet.</p>
               <p>Thrice was I tempted to follow the Jesuit into the secret chamber, but fear restrained me. I felt anxious to assist Madelon, if need be, but dreaded more the priest's anger. I was bewildered, and in my bewilderment remained passive and silent, until aroused by the voice of Patrick, who tremblingly asked, what had become of his reverence. I replied, that he had gone into an adjoining apartment but said nothing concerning the panel, when I discovered that he had not witnessed the priest's exit. After that we fell into a whispered conversation I wished to conciliate the rascal that I might learn more concerning the murder of Frank Sinclair—and Patrick finally seemed to gather some confidence and courage from my well-set words. At length I ventured to ask, whether the priest had not directed him to first entice young Sinclair upon the ice, and then push him into the water.</p>
               <p>The Irishman's retort was just what expected. He had. Unmindful of our safety—unmindful of the additional risk he ran in having Madelon discovered—unmindful of everything, but the gratification of his own ungovernable hatred, he had secretly<pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC5820-00000104"/> planned and directed the accomplishment of this unnecessary murder. That it was unnecessary, uncalled for, and useless—neither demanded by any exigency of the occasion, nor by any benefit likely to accrue to the Church, was too plainly evident for me to doubt, nor could all the priest's rhetoric convince me otherwise.</p>
               <p>At that moment we both of us had our backs towards the panel, which, Father Huestace seeing, embraced the opportunity of re-entering, unobserved, the library. He addressed us before we were aware of his presence. At the sound of his voice we both turned round and faced him. He was slightly flushed, but not at all discomposed. Without waiting to be questioned, he proceeded to account for the scream which had so startled us. Madelon had revived, he said, and had been listening, to the story of her lover's death. A dreadful history for her, I thought.</p>
               <p>Immediately after making this explanation, which occupied but a moment, he turned to the door, and, unlocking it, would have passed out into the hall, but that the form of the old housekeeper confronted him upon the sill. She was dreadfully frightened, and had arisen in haste from her bed, as her whole appearance betokened.</p>
               <p>"O, Holy Virgin, what a shriek!" she exclaimed, clasping her hands before the priest, and trembling in every nerve. "I never heard the like before in all my life. What was it, your reverence? What was it?"</p>
               <p>"Some of the idle, people in the back street, who have been drinking and got into a quarrel, I suppose," replied the priest, hastily. "I am going to see."</p>
               <p>The old woman, it seems, was not in the plot, and knew nothing of Madelon's being concealed in the house. This may appear strange, but I assure you, that it was quite possible.</p>
               <p>"But it sounded just as if it was in the house, and frightened me so, that I couldn't lay still!" continued the old housekeeper, and her teeth fairly chattered. "It was dreadful, dreadful!"</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Barbary, nonsense!" retorted the Jesuit, hastily, and with considerable impatience. "You were but partially awake when you heard the noise, and have magnified the sound. It came from the back street, I am sure. Some brute has been beating his wife, most likely; such things, you know, are not unusual occurrences in this locality. It is nothing,<pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC5820-00000105"/> however, that will harm you—so to bed, Barbary, and sleep in peace."</p>
               <p>The old woman, still muttering, turned to depart; and the priest stood gazing after her, until the slight echo of her footsteps could no longer be heard. At length, apparently satisfied that she was out of sight and hearing, he turned round to Patrick and myself, and cautioning us to remain quiet, he closed the library door and disappeared. In a few minutes he re-appeared again.</p>
               <p>"I have been to the front door," said he—"and everything appears to be quiet. The night is too deep for many to be abroad; and even, if heard, a scream in this quarter would not be likely to attract much attention. There does not, however, appear to be any alarm; consequently, I conclude, that no one heard Madelon, except old Barbary, and we have nothing to fear from her. And now a glass of something strong to drive away the vapors."</p>
               <p>Having each drank off a portion of the liquor, the priest remarked;—</p>
               <p>"You had not finished your narrative, Patrick. Continue. We shall not now be disturbed."</p>
               <p>After an apparently thoughtful pause, Patrick resumed his recital, something as follows,</p>
               <p>"I told your reverence, how the man sank away under the ice, and how he shrieked;"—here Patrick cast his eyes around the room suspiciously; "I never heard but one shriek like it—only one, your reverence, only one; and that I shall never forget. It—was—just—like—<emph>her's</emph>; Holy Virgin! just like <emph>her's,</emph> when the hatchet crushed in her skull!" here the brute's manner became horribly, frightfully intense, "That shriek made me think about <emph>her</emph>, and I began to shake in the limbs—it was so dark, and cold, and still. I was afraid to move away, and afraid to remain where I was. After a little while I heard another shriek, and then another, and the last one sounded to me away under the ice. The first was <emph>her</emph> voice—I'd swear to it among ten thousand—the other was his, for it was just like the shriek he gave, when he sank away under the crumbling ice. Holy Mother, how fearfully the sounds echoed and re-echoed! I stood it as long as I could, but at last, with a yell, I started off on a desperate run. I never once looked back, for somehow, I fancied, that they both were at my heels, and I didn't want to see them. Her bloody face, and his white brow, would have struck me dead. It was a long, long run, from there to here, your reverence, but I never once stopped, till I stood<pb n="204-205" xml:id="VAC5820-00000106"/> at the door out there. Then I felt safe, and breathed freer; for I know that your reverence could and would absolve me from the deed, and protect me even from the fiends. Then I turned round and crossed myself, and <emph>they</emph>—Kathleen and the strange man—turned and fled away together. I saw it all as plainly as I see you, and my blood curdled at the sight."</p>
               <p>There was ignorance—there was bigotry. That man, who stood there before me, reeking with the blood of two human beings—the wife whom he had sworn to cherish and protect, and the stranger whom he had treacherously misled to death—even that man, with the shrieks of his murdered victims dragging him down, down to hell, imagined himself safe under the protection of the Church, and vainly flattered himself with the blasphemous delusion, that the priest was endowed with the Creator's power to forgive and forget. And confident in that most dangerous of all delusions, the wretch could live, and in a measure be happy—could die, and be content. And the priest, as the tenets of his faith directed, encouraged and confirmed the dark superstition.</p>
               <p>"You were right, Patrick, when you thought that <emph>here</emph> you were safe—that <emph>here</emph>, at least, you were secure from all danger," exclaimed the priest, confidently dently. "Though the spirits of a thousand dead people pursued you, they dare not cross the threshold of the Church to injure one of the faithful. Be assured, Patrick, that, if the intention is good, the deed, what ever it is, will be forgiven. Behold!"—the priest pointed to a wooden image of the Virgin, and Patrick prostrated himself upon his knees;—"behold! the Blessed Mother even now smiles upon you; it is a token of her favor—an indication of that forgiveness you have merited at her hands. Besides, if Mr. Sinclair, at least, had not rushed along with such imprudent haste, he would have seen the treacherous spot, and not been—"</p>
               <p>"Murdered!" I involuntarily broke in, and a cold shudder crept over me at the sound of my own voice. It was, as if some power, over which I had no control, had urged me to the utterance. The sound filled the room, and yet my lips did not seem to move.</p>
               <p>The plainly spoken, terrible sounding word, caused a visible start in both the Jesuit and Patrick.</p>
               <p>"Murdered!" echoed the latter, quickly, loudly, abruptly, and almost fiercely.</p>
               <p>"Be quiet, Patrick, or lower your voice," cried Father Huestace, catching him by the arm. "If you<pb n="206-207" xml:id="VAC5820-00000107"/> continue in that tone, you might as well go cry your words upon the corner!"</p>
               <p>"D'yee mind the ugly word he used, y'er riverence?" continued Patrick, having lowered his voice to a whisper. "Murdered! As if I'd murder the young man! Ugh! what an ugly word. Bedad, it frightens me. Murdered! No, indade! The young man fell into the river accidentally. That's the way uv it, isn't it, ye'r riverence? particularly to them as can take a hint."</p>
               <p>"Of course he fell in accidentally, Patrick. Who would doubt it if we said so?" and the Jesuit fixed his eyes upon my face, as if to intimidate me. "Be easy, Patrick, be easy. And Joseph must not express such unseemly conclusions. They frighten <emph>honest</emph> people—and of such are we—besides being dangerous to the utterer. Mr. Sinclair fell into the river—let me hear no more of <emph>murder!</emph>"</p>
               <p>The priest enunciated the last word emphatically; but still I took no notice of the covert threat which they contained, for the time had not yet come. A breach, however, had been opened between us, and every time we met it widened. The train was already sprung—in a brief time followed the explosion.</p>
               <p>"And now, Patrick, it were best that you go home. But mind, no more drinking to night," said Father Huestace, sternly. "I want you to go from here straight home and to bed. Do otherwise, and you were better under the ice with Frank Sinclair. Do as I bid you, and both spiritually and temporally, you will find favor in my sight."</p>
               <p>Patrick earnestly protested his willingness to do whatever the priest directed; and kneeling down before the latter, he supplicated a parting blessing. The Jesuit crossed his hands upon his bosom—lifted his eyes impiously on high, and mumbled over a senseless prayer, at the conclusion of which Patrick kissed the crucifix and departed satisfied.</p>
               <p>And then the priest and myself were alone.</p>
               <p>For several moments after Patrick's departure, Father Huestace continued to regard me, closely, sternly, suspiciously, and it might be hatefully; for that he had grown to dislike me, and would some day turn upon me, I felt convinced. It was a piercing, diabolical glance, and I could not brave it. My eyes, against my will, sought the floor.</p>
               <p>"Joseph," said he, at length, slowly and deeply, but still not angrily, as I had anticipated.</p>
               <p>I looked up somewhat more confidently. The sound of the human voice, no matter to what key attuned<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC5820-00000108"/> tuned, always did encourage and animate me. The priest's brow was unclouded. Where but a moment before had lowered the darkest frowns, all now was calm, and clear, and pleasant. The change was as great as it was sudden, and one who had not known the crafty Papist, would have been at a loss to account for it. I knew by that time, however, that his smile was as much to be feared as his darkest frown—that his deceit was full as deep as his hatred.</p>
               <p>"Joseph,"—he continued again, after a pause; "I like not these evidences of your <choice>
                     <sic>lessoning</sic>
                     <corr>lessening</corr>
                  </choice> interest in the welfare and prosperity of the Holy Church. They indicate something, I am sure. You grow cold, and haggle at the performance of those things which every true and faithful child of the Church should glory in and be proud of. You work mechanically, and not with that zealous warmth which the Church expects and demands even of her meanest followers. These heretics are our natural enemies, and to put one of them out of the way, is not to <emph>murder</emph>. Reflect, Joseph, reflect! You are young, and should not imbibe such notions—they are heretical to the Church, and lead to difficulties and troubles unnumbered. Our duty is clear and unmistakable; and unescapable too, even should our wishes tend that way. You have acted strangely on several occasions, Joseph; and any other than myself would have mistrusted you. I, however, think that I know you better. But enough of this now. You will ponder over what I have said, and profit by it. It is getting late, and I have yet something to say upon another subject."</p>
               <p>I did not once interrupt the priest with either an excuse or a profession. In my heart I knew that his words were not sincere—that his convictions were of a different cast, and that all the falsehoods I could utter—even should I descend to such a course—would not change either his opinion or his determination.</p>
               <p>"This girl must be provided for," he continued, after a pause, which he evidently intended should give effect to his previous words. "Circumstances, as you are aware, are becoming urgent. The clamor is growing loud; and besides, she is also getting troublesome. For the purpose of keeping her quiet, I have, since she has been here, kept her so dosed with narcotics, that even her robust frame is fast giving way under their deleterious effect. Only at certain times have I allowed her to become conscious, and then she has annoyed me excessively. Food I have been compelled to force down her throat, to prevent her from sinking entirely. To-night, as you have seen, her<pb n="210-211" xml:id="VAC5820-00000109"/> strong constitution rallied. At almost any other time that scream would have ruined us. To prevent a recurrence of what transpired this evening, and thus effectually secure us from discovery until the girl is taken hence, I have removed her to a still more impenetrable apartment."</p>
               <p>"Whither?" I briefly demanded, without displaying the interest that I really felt.</p>
               <p>"Draw close and listen," continued Father Huestace. "Beneath that room, of whose existence so few are aware, there is a small vault, a knowledge of which still fewer possess. It is entered by a trap that is artfully concealed in the floor, and would not be seen, even if it were not hid by the carpet. It is a damp unwholesome place, but I had no alternative. Upon hearings Madelon's sudden and fearful scream, I entered that apartment, as you know, and found her arisen, and sufficiently conscious to understand all that was said. Fearful of still further demonstrations on her part—either at the present time, or on some future occasions still more inopportune—which from that room"—and he pointed to the secret chamber—"<emph>might</emph> be heard in the street, and could be heard in any part of the house, I conveyed her into the vault beneath, where she now is, and where she will have to remain until she quits this place forever, which will not, however, be long. In fact, she could not exist there for any considerable period; still I could not permit her to remain any longer in that apartment, particularly after having heard Patrick; unless, indeed, I completely deadened her with opiates, and that I, do not wish to do. The first conscious moment she has she will be sure to rave of what she unfortunately overheard this evening."</p>
               <p>"Doubtless," I replied, with a shudder. "It would be but natural."</p>
               <p>"If she raves now, however,"—continued the priest,—"the stone walls alone will hear her." Here he paused for a moment, and then continued; "the lover gone, and, the girl in my power, makes our triumph complete. I would crush the rest, if I could; but that, Joseph, is too much of an undertaking. I can but curse the heretics."</p>
               <p>"But, your reverence, will not young Sinclair's disappearance—known, as he is, at least by some, to be Madelon's accepted lover—coming so soon after <emph>her</emph> abduction, create an intense excitement, and lead to an investigation that will prove unescapable?" I inquired, as a recollection of the young man's treacherous murder flitted through my mind.</p>
               <pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC5820-00000110"/>
               <p>"The cry is already up—the alarm already given!" rejoined the priest, with excitement. "Madelon's disappearance is the town-talk. It forms the staple of conversation alike in the church and the theatre, the family circle and the street; and this will be but adding another coal to the fire. In such matters as these, men must risk much; and trust much to good fortune. Even I say to <emph>you</emph> what to others I would not, that there are things over which no human being has any control. We may calculate, and scheme, and plan, and fortify, and thus accomplish much, as in the present case; but we are not infallible. The prisoner <emph>may</emph> escape from the deepest dungeon, and so may our best and strongest plans be frustrated. The ignorant believe not this, but we <emph>know</emph> it. In the matter of Frank Sinclair's disappearance, however, the mystery, for the present, at least, is impenetrable. Nothing is at all likely to be discovered until the breaking up of the ice in the spring—nearly two months yet—and by that time the appearance of the body will be so changed, that his own mother would not be likely to recognize him. With the facts of the case but three persons are acquainted—Patrick, yourself, and myself. You <emph>will</emph> not, and he <emph>dare</emph> not, betray the secret."</p>
               <p>I was of course compelled to acknowledge the priest correct in his conclusions generally, even to his last assertion that I would not betray him; for at that time my resolution was still unsettled and <choice>
                     <sic>vascillating</sic>
                     <corr>vacillating</corr>
                  </choice>—my course undecided and weak.</p>
               <p>"But enough of this for tonight," he continued, after a slight pause, at the same time vacating his chair. "It is growing very late, and I am unusually weary. I had designed communicating to you some things which now I am too fatigued to enter upon. I will say however, that I have commission for you to execute which will take you away from this city; that Patrick will accompany you; and that you must start almost immediately. The affair relates to Madelon, and our future security. Ask me no questions now," he continued, perceiving that I was about to address him, "but hasten hence and get a night's rest. Tomorrow call upon Patrick—I neglected making, my wishes known, to him when he was here—and send him to me; and be yourself, here by twelve tomorrow night, prepared for a journey. At that time I will have all things in-readiness for your departure. You need not come before—unless, indeed, you have something of importance to communicate—but <emph>be sure</emph>"—and the priest ejaculated the word's slowly—<pb n="214-215" xml:id="VAC5820-00000111"/> "you do not fail me then. Now go your way. Good night!"</p>
               <p>Without further parley, I took leave, my mind completely bewildered with conflicting thoughts.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
               <p>Almost unconsciously—mechanically, as it were—I followed the priest's directions. In his hands I had almost lost my own identity—had become a mere instrument played upon at another's will. In complying with the priest's commands—for such they had got to be—I violated my own conscience, and yet could not have explained why I did so, otherwise than as I have just stated. I weighed well every word that was uttered—scrutinized every deed that was committed, and yet went on countenancing, and even assisting in many of the nefarious transactions. My own conduct was an anomaly. I was feeble in right-doing, and the crafty Jesuit profited by the advantage of my mental imbecility. I could see the dark vortex that yawned before me, and yet had not the power to stem the current that bore me onward to destruction. With closed eyes I drifted on, hourly sinking deeper and<pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC5820-00000112"/> deeper in the flood of sin. It seemed as if a thunderbolt alone would awake my enslaved energies.</p>
               <p>In accordance with the priest's directions, I did not my appearance at the church until late the following night—after twelve o'clock, I think.</p>
               <p>During the intermediate time the excitement in regard to Madelon's abduction still continued at the ebb; added to which was then a greater excitement in relation to young Sinclair's disappearance, which had by this time begun to agitate the public mind. The two events coming so close upon one another almost paralyzed the mass of the people; and in the confusion and dismay no steps were taken towards a discovery until it was too late. Suspicion pointed its unerring finger towards the priest; but still there was an absence of all proof; consequently a delay occurred most favorable to Father Huestace.</p>
               <p>As I before remarked, I repaired to the church at the designated hour. Upon my arrival, I found Father Huestace and the hackman, Patrick, in close consultation. The latter, as I immediately noticed from the singularity of the circumstance, was much more neatly dressed than usual. In general he looked coarse and dirty; but now his whole appearance was changed for the better.</p>
               <p>The priest welcomed me cordially or at least a looker-on would have thought so—directed me to a seat, and then called my attention to business.</p>
               <p>"Briefly, my good Joseph, for our time is short and pressing," said he, with well-dissembled kindness. "Words, save when directly to the point, are idle. Mark then. I want you, with Patrick's assistance, to convey Madelon to the Black Nunnery at Montreal. I have already communicated with Patrick upon the subject, and as I anticipated, he is ready and willing to help me in this last and important service. It only now remains for me to give you your directions. Of course <emph>you</emph> will not object to the business, as the complete triumph of the Church demands, and our safety requires, it."</p>
               <p>The hypocritical Jesuit still harped upon the Church, seeking to conceal beneath that covering his own brutal passions.</p>
               <p>"The officers of justice are hot upon the scent,"—he continued, "and we have not a moment to lose. Evidence has transpired upon the investigation which is now in progress, that points inevitably towards me. Assuredly to-morrow this house and the church will be thoroughly searched; and there must be nothing which they can possibly discover—nothing to confirm<pb n="218-219" xml:id="VAC5820-00000113"/> the charges which have been indirectly brought against me. In this we are all interested; for, as I said before, if I fall through the act of another it is not myself alone that fall shall surely overwhelm. But to the point. You and Patrick are not marked, as far as I can judge, and therefore can leave the city unsuspected. I must remain to quiet the authorities. Your own judgment, Joseph, will convince you of the propriety, nay, necessity of assisting me, and cheerfully. The plan I have adopted is slow and hazardous, but still the most feasible one I could hit upon. I would not yet have attempted her removal, but for the reasons I have stated."</p>
               <p>"But how is it to be accomplished?" I inquired. "The distance is great, and the season of the year bad. Besides our charge will be a peculiar one."</p>
               <p>The priest did not answer me directly, but first turned to the hackman.</p>
               <p>"Patrick,"—said he—"time advances. You have some distance to go, and had better now start for your vehicle. But mark! the hour is late, and you may be questioned. Be careful what you say, and above all things be sure that you are not followed. Much depends upon your conduct. And now, Joseph, follow me."</p>
               <p>Patrick had quitted the library before the priest addressed me; and as the Jesuit opened the panel and passed through into the secret apartment, I followed him. Leaving the door open, the light from the library faintly illuminated the interior room. Shudderingly I beheld a black coffin resting upon the narrow bed. The lid, heavily mounted with, a silver crucifix, stood against the wall, at the head of the couch.</p>
               <p>"Behold my answer, Joseph!" exclaimed the priest, as we both leaned over, and gazed into the narrow box.</p>
               <p>"Dead!" I exclaimed completely carried away, and deceived by the sight that met my eyes.</p>
               <p>There before me, stretched out in the close coffin and clad in all the cold, white, paraphernalia of the grave, reposed in death-like silence, the persecuted Madelon. Her eyes were tightly closed, and the long black lashes lay drooping upon the fair white skin. And even dead, as she seemed, and as I for the moment fancied her, she looked exquisitely lovely. I bent over the coffin fascinated. The stern voice of the plotting priest aroused me.</p>
               <p>"Not dead, Joseph; only sleeping," he said. "She will awake when needful, without a doubt."</p>
               <pb n="220-221" xml:id="VAC5820-00000114"/>
               <p>Then I saw it all—saw what the priest contemplated—saw the trick he designed accomplishing with our assistance. Madelon was not dead, but only drugged. It was but another deception—a brutal one to the girl, however—to be added to the many that I had already witnessed.</p>
               <p>"You comprehend my plan, Joseph, do you not?" quoth the priest.</p>
               <p>"Yes," I replied, still gazing upon poor Madelon, with pitying interest.</p>
               <p>"You must certainly concur in my arrangements, Joseph," continued Father Huestace. "You must be as well aware as I am, that otherwise than as she now is, we could not remove her. The tax upon her strength will be great, I admit, but we are driven to this point; and we must not be discovered, even should she perish."</p>
               <p>"Right, your reverence, right!" I muttered, indifferent to everything but the forlorn situation of our victim—for she was as well my victim as the Jesuit's. "I understand all, and am ready. What next?"</p>
               <p>The priest did not half like my readiness, that was evident. However, he went on with the necessary preparations without apparently heeding it, doubtless thinking that that, at least, was not the proper time to notice it.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I was anxious to get to the end of the tragedy, for I felt that a crisis was approaching which would endanger either the stony-hearted, scheming, hypocritical Jesuit, or myself. How, when, or where, however, I had no suspicion. A cloud obscured my vision; but sometimes a glimpse of coming events would break through it. Each circling hour brought the climax nearer.</p>
               <p>As I said, the priest took no especial notice of my ready compliance, but proceeded to arrange the lid upon the coffin, and then to screw it down, informing me at the same time, that it was well ventilated, and in every way expressly adapted for just such a use as it was about being put to.</p>
               <p>At his direction I then assisted him to carry it into the library, where we placed it lengthwise upon several chairs. As we passed out the priest closed the secret door, leaving no trace of the hidden apartment. Of course I have not stated all the conversation that occurred nor related all the little events that transpired, and which contributed to consume time. Such a course would have been wearisome to both you and myself. Several hours had now slipped past, and morning was rapidly approaching. According to the travellings arrangements, a stage left this city for<pb n="222-223" xml:id="VAC5820-00000115"/> Trenton at four o'clock. Thence by a similar conveyance we would cross to New Brunswick, and so on to New-York.</p>
               <p>Just about this time a vehicle drove up in the vicinity of the church, but so noiselessly that others, not like ourselves, on the watch for even the <emph>most</emph> trifling occurrence, would not have heard it. The ground being still covered with ice and snow, its silent, approach was not, of course, surprising.</p>
               <p>In a few moments after, Patrick stole into the library, and whispered that all was in readiness, and everything safe. Father Huestace himself then walked out to the front of the church, and looked, and listened. Returning in a few minutes he beckoned us to his side.</p>
               <p>"And now a few final directions," he said. "Stand close, for I do not wish to talk aloud, even here. So far everything is prosperous; but to accomplish your journey successfully, you must be bold and cunning, and never at a loss for a ready answer, a plausible excuse, or a natural explanation. To you, Joseph, I particularly address these instructions; for you are better adapted both by education and association, to successfully practice them. Patrick is only to carry out your instructions. Upon you rests the responsibility. Now, the greatest danger that you will probably bably encounter, will be in getting away from this city. If, you accomplish that successfully, the battle, as I may say, is won. If we are suspected and watched, you may be detected, and defeated; if not, your departure will be easy. Against that it was impossible for me to guard. But once off, never stop longer than is actually necessary until you are at your journey's end. Of course, at the various cities along the route you will be compelled to remain for a short period. At such times, Joseph, you will act according to the instructions which I have already given you. Upon arriving at Montreal you will hasten immediately to the Seminary, and present the letter with which I have supplied you. That explains all, and will insure you a welcome. And now let us make ready, for Patrick has to see to his vehicle after the coffin is deposited at the stage-office."</p>
               <p>While the priest is busy re-examining the coffin, to make sure that all is right, I will give you an outline of the secret instructions with which he had furnished me. At the several points along the route at which we were compelled to stop, I was to seek out particular priests—Jesuits I suppose—and deliver into their hands certain letters, which would insure, me their hearty co-operation.</p>
               <pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC5820-00000116"/>
               <p>While executing this portion of my directions, Patrick was to stand guard over the coffin; and as soon as the different individuals were notified of my arrival, I was to see that our charge was conveyed to whatever place they directed, and there opened. At certain times, and in just such quantities, I was to administer the opiate. The priest was very particular to impress upon me the necessity of being extremely careful in this respect, as too little might allow of her reviving, and too much might cause her to sleep so sound that she would never awake; and neither result was what he desired, just then, at least. Patrick was to accompany me as far as Montreal, and then return. I was to remain at the Seminary until Father Huestace himself arrived, when I would receive what further instructions were necessary.</p>
               <p>Do you not see what an abject slave I had got to be; in the hands of this tyrannical and scheming Jesuit? O, even the thin blood of my old age rushes through my veins more quickly, as I reflect upon it; and the memory of the past darkens my closing hours. Fool, that I was, to be so misled!</p>
               <p>A little of that anodyne, if you please; for my lips are hot and parched, and my eyes see dimly, as in a cloudy mirror. There, thank you—I feel better and stronger now. A little rest, and I shall be able to proceed; and soon I shall stand confessed before you.</p>
               <p>(In, a few moments, he resumed his singular narrative.)</p>
               <p>At length the priest placed a well filled purse in my hand, and signified that everything was in proper condition for starting. Extinguishing the light, he threw the door open into the hall, and passed out, directing Patrick and myself to take up the coffin and follow him. Without uttering a word we obeyed his instructions. At the front-door he again stopped and listened attentively. Apparently satisfied with the condition of things in the street, he turned round and whispered us to pass out. That we immediately did; leaving him concealed behind the half-closed door.</p>
               <p>The moment we gained the front street I looked all around, from a natural dread of detection. Neither moon nor stars were shining, and the atmosphere was intensely black and impervious. But for the half white snow that covered the ground, no object, unless within a few feet of us, would have been distinguishable. As it was, but little could be seen upon the opposite side of the street.</p>
               <p>A short distance above the church, and close up to the curb-stone on the other side of the highway,<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC5820-00000117"/> stood a long, covered car, such as was generally used for carting furniture in wet weather. In this we deposited our burden, and all without awaking the slightest echo of our doings. And all the while the priest stood peeping out from behind the door; our position north of the church, where the view from the house to the front street was unobstructed, affording him every chance to note our operations.</p>
               <p>The coffin once in the wagon, Patrick and myself jumped up in front, and the former seizing the reins, drove off, but at such a slow pace, that the motion was actually painful. Still it was necessary, for the least noise would probably have betrayed us, and created the very evidence that would have sent us all to the State-Prison, if nothing worse. To have detected us at that moment, would have afforded proof positive; and I myself felt anxious to get away in safety, for many reasons.</p>
               <p>In a little, while the tall spire of the old church was hid from view; and we dashed on at a more rapid rate. As our speed increased, it became necessary that I should seat myself upon the coffin to prevent it from bouncing, as otherwise it would have done. My singular position—sitting as I was directly over the beating heart of Madelon—set me thinking —and thinking led to reproaches—and reproaches to remorse. I bowed my head upon my knees, and looked back into the past. Fearfully real there arose before me the spirit of the murdered Frank Sinclair—murdered for what? I began to ask myself, and could only answer, to gratify a bad man's hate. And then with painful distinctness my mind passed from one scene to the other of the changing drama in which I had been playing such at base and deceitful part. I began to see it as such—began to realize the degradation to which I had so long submitted. But still I knew not what to do, and so went on, all the while hoping that something might turn up that would change the face of affairs, and safely release me from my slavery. I felt, too, that I was mistrusted, and that Patrick was but a spy upon my actions; and knowing his brutality and ignorance, I stood in fear of him.</p>
               <p>In due time we arrived at the office, in the northern suburbs of the city; and having arranged all the preliminaries started upon our journey, without the least indication of anything being wrong.</p>
               <p>Upon our arrival we proceeded to place the coffin in such a position as the circumstances required. That accomplished, Patrick mounted his vehicle and<pb n="228-229" xml:id="VAC5820-00000118"/> drove rapidly away. In a little, while—how long, exactly, I cannot say—he returned afoot and running. He had left the team, he, said, with a man who was in his employment, and, who, he had directed to await his coming at a certain point.</p>
               <p>Just as the stage was about leaving, curiosity or some other controlling feeling, induced me to raise the window and look out into the darkness. A tall man in a long, black cloak, and slouched cap, who was standing near the spot, instantly attracted my attention. A cold chill crept over me, for I at once fancied him a police spy. Directly the man slightly dropped the cloak from his face, and revealed a pair of intensely black eyes. It was the priest, and he had come to see us off. He knew that I recognized him and placing one finger upon his lips, he remained in that position until we dashed away.</p>
               <p>It is scarcely necessary for me to relate every particular of our journey; it is sufficient to state that the programme furnished by the priest was successfully carried out; and the strange <choice>
                     <sic>triumverate</sic>
                     <corr>triumvirate</corr>
                  </choice>, the tool, the murderer, and the drugged woman, arrived safely in Montreal.</p>
               <p>That was not the day of telegraphs, and other quick inventions, or we might have had more impediments to encounter. It is true that Madelon gave us some troubles, when the effects of the drugs would partially pass off, as it did on several occasions; but notwithstanding, and all things considered, our flight was accomplished much more easily than I had anticipated. Her conscious spells, however, were well-timed; generally occurring at or about those occasions when we were compelled to stop. An application of the drug, which under the circumstances I was always enabled to make, would soon quiet the poor girl's low, deep moans. Once, indeed, she stirred in the coffin, and so perceptibly as to attract the attention of a passenger; but casting the blame upon Patrick, who I accused of letting the coffin slip, we escaped a probable exposure; the stranger, doubtless, crediting the explanation which I meant to convey in my address to my companion.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC5820-00000119"/>
               <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
               <p>As I stated, we arrived safely in the city of Montreal.</p>
               <p>Without a moment's delay I started off in search of one Father Kewlinn, to whom I bore a letter of introduction or instruction. I found him, according to my directions, at the priest's Seminary; an institution attached to the Hotel Dieu, or Black Nunnery. My letter was speedily examined; and then Father Kewlinn and myself hastened back after our charge.</p>
               <p>After placing the coffin in a vehicle, which Father Kewlinn quickly summoned, we all three started on, the priest leading the way. In a short time we arrived at the Seminary, the vehicle with the coffin coming up a moment or two after, Father Kewlinn then signified to Patrick that his labors were about at an end—so ran the instructions contained in the letter, he said. In regard to myself, he but repeated the directions which I had already received from Father Huestace.</p>
               <p>"And now take up your charge and convey it within," he said, pointing from the coffin, which yet remained in the vehicle, to the small, but heavy door of the Seminary.</p>
               <p>"Why not directly to the Nunnery?" I inquired, pointing my finger towards that building; a huge structure of mason which stood some few hundred feet distant in an opposite direction. I felt anxious for Madelon, and thought that of the two evils the Nunnery was the least. I liked not the hard and dark face of Father Kewlinn; besides, I knew the vile character of many of these Seminaries—knew that earth held not more lawless men than were there congregated; and I feared that the poor girl might be called upon to suffer still further indignities. Her beauty would but endanger her the more—not protect or save her.</p>
               <p>"For many reasons," Father Kewlinn replied, sternly; as if he was not used to, and did like to be, questioned. "This, if nothing more. The Lady Abbess is not yet apprised of your coming, or of what is required at her hands. This I am requested to inform her of;<pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC5820-00000120"/> in the mean time taking the girl under my especial care. This letter is explicit in all its details. Besides, there are other reasons, which I do not think that it is necessary for me to explain to any one. Father Huestace and myself fully understand each other, and are well aware as to what is our duty. And now get the coffin within, for the day wanes and the air grows colder."</p>
               <p>I offered no further resistance to Father Kewlinn's commands, feeling that it would be useless; but directed Patrick and the cartman, who had been standing apart during our conversation, to assist me in carrying the coffin into the building. Inside the door the cartman was discharged, and Father Kewlinn himself supplied his place.</p>
               <p>After proceeding some distance up abroad winding staircase, we entered a long, gloomy hall, which finally turned off to the right and terminated in another shorter flight of stairs. At the head of the stairs we halted; and the priest, taking a key from his pocket, unlocked the only door that was to be seen. The room we entered was a small, gloomy, prison-looking place; doubtless in the centre of the building, and unquestionably next the roof, for all the light it received was from a small window in the ceiling. It looked like just what it was, a place of solitary penance. The floor was uncarpeted, and the walls bare and damp. At the upper end of the apartment, against the wall, was a small pine bench; and in one corner was scattered some loose straw, which, with at small stand supporting a rude, wooden crucifix, completed the arrangements of the cell-like room.</p>
               <p>Directly after our entrance we set the coffin down upon the floor, and at the priest's direction I proceeded to unscrew the lid. That completed, I raised any face to Father Kewlinn in mute inquiry, and awaited his directions. As I looked up I observed that Patrick had quitted the room whilst I had been engaged upon the coffin with my back turned towards him. However, I took no outward notice of the circumstance, as it was but what I could only reasonably expect; and though I was now left alone, I felt a relief at his absence. It was the last I ever saw of him, though not the last I heard of him. The measure of his crimes was not yet full.</p>
               <p>At a sign from Father Kewlinn I removed the lid entirely from the coffin, and exposed the pale face of Madelon to his view. It <emph>was</emph> pale, and thin, too; but still indescribably lovely, even in its paleness and thinness. Father Huestace's powerful drugs, however<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC5820-00000121"/> ever, were fast destroying the girl, mentally and physically.</p>
               <p>The priest looked on with cold indifference, even as the vision of Madelon's fair and innocent face flashed before his eyes. He had no heart for pity, or sympathy, or kindness. Long before it was steeled against every human emotion, I looked pityingly, I know; for in that moment, more than ever, I realized all that the maiden had suffered, and compassionated her misery.</p>
               <p>A slight tremor agitated the frame of Madelon, and arrested our attention. It was like the shudder one experiences when viewing some abhorrent spectacle. In her it indicated a passing away of the effects of the drugs, and a returning to consciousness.</p>
               <p>"She revives, whispered Father Kewlinn, looking into my face, indifferently.</p>
               <p>I replied not, but beckoned him to stand aside; thinking it best that Madelon should not see us—particularly him—when she first unclosed her eyes. He complied with my mute request, and together we took up a position at the head of the coffin, and of course in the rear of the young girl.</p>
               <p>The tremor having passed away, Madelon began to twist, and stretch, and turn, like one awaking from a sound sleep. Occasionally she would moan in the most heart-rending manner. At length, and evidently with a very painful effort, she raised her hands up, and commenced rubbing her face. This continued for some time, when she slowly opened her eyes, and finally, after several ineffectual attempts, sat upright in the coffin.</p>
               <p>"O, my head, my head, my poor head," she murmured, in tones of utter despair, while she continued to rub her forehead and temples.</p>
               <p>How I pitted her! how my heart ached for that poor victim of priestly passions, and religious hypocrisy!</p>
               <p>"Where am I? What does it all mean?" she continued, becoming vehement in her language and gesticulation. "This strange and gloomy place—this coffin—these grave clothes, and this feeling of death, which paralyzes all my faculties! O, my God, what has become of me? Frank, dear Frank"—here she paused for a moment, and appeared to be thinking; "Frank! I have no Frank now. I begin to remember all—the horrid dream was all true—too true; and that bad man's words were reality. O, how the recollection of that night crowds upon me—how the memory of what that wicked man said rises up in<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC5820-00000122"/> my mind; 'he is dead—under the ice—gone forever!'—Frank, my Frank, sleeping in the cold waters of the Delaware; and I? where am I? where am I? O God, why did I not die? why did I live to be so wronged, so persecuted? Why was not I too, cast into the river? then would my sufferings have been at an end, and my spirit resting in the bosom of its Maker."</p>
               <p>Here Madelon's feelings had become so intensified that she grew dizzy, and at length fell away into unconsciousness.</p>
               <p>"She is insensible," said Father Kewlinn, without at all noticing the mystery of her words.</p>
               <p>He did not care, very likely, if murder had been done—if more was to be done, so long as it was committed in the name of the Church and religion. Under such circumstances it was not murder—for the Church, secretly, at least, justified the killing of a heretic.</p>
               <p>"Help me raise her from the coffin, and convey her to yonder pallet of straw," he continued, turning to me. "She will soon revive again."</p>
               <p>"You will not leave her here?" I inquired, with astonishment.</p>
               <p>Father Kewlinn straightened himself up, and looked me full and sternly in the face.</p>
               <p>"Here it is for <emph>me</emph> to command, and <emph>you</emph> to obey!" he said, angrily. "Remember that; and while you are here, never question my orders again. You are a priest, and should know your duty to the Church, and to your Superiors, better. Leave her here!" he continued, bitterly—"and why not? Is she not an <emph>apostate</emph>, and should she not therefore be punished? Leave her where I direct! that is my answer. Now take hold and assist me."</p>
               <p>My blood was so stirred with indignation and anger, that, desperate as would have been the attempt, I felt almost like openly resisting the commanding priest. My hands so shook with the intensity of my emotion, that it was some time before I could use them. For myself, I had ceased to be a priest—ceased to be a Catholic. I was only a man, and one who had done much wrong under a false impression. I had mistook bigotry and superstition for religion—but the vail had fallen from my eyes. I began now to think of saving myself and Madelon, if it were possible.</p>
               <p>Several minutes elapsed before I took hold of Madelon—and still she continued in a stupor. At length we bore her across the room and laid her upon the loose straw; and then the priest directed me to take up the coffin and precede him out of the—room. By<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC5820-00000123"/> this time night was approaching, and the shadows began to deepen in the apartment. It seemed horrid to me, to leave Madelon alone there, and in such a condition. I could not help loitering and demurring; but the priest, with an impatient stamp, pointed me to the door. Smothering the malediction that quivered upon my trembling lips, I took up the coffin, cast a lingering look at poor Madelon, and quitted the apartment; the unfeeling priest following close at my heels. Once outside the door, he led the way into the lower part of the Seminary, remarking as he did so—why, however, I could not guess—that he would see that the young lady was properly cared for.</p>
               <p>Having deposited the coffin according to direction, and devoured the niggardly meal that was set before me, I was promptly conducted, by Father Kewlinn himself, to the apartment that had been <choice>
                     <sic>alotted</sic>
                     <corr>allotted</corr>
                  </choice> me, and which was upon the landing, immediately beneath the one occupied by Madelon. It was a small, cheerless, half-furnished room, but a trifle better than the one in which Madelon herself was confined; and as I cast myself, even as I was, upon the poor apology of a bed, I felt like one forsaken of God and man. Wearied, and worn, and sick at heart, the only portion of my dress that I stopped, to remove, was my boots.</p>
               <p>Deep darkness had long enshrouded everything before I fell asleep. My body, it is true, was weary—O, how weary! but my restless soul would not permit me to slumber. Thought had become a dreadful thing to me; and yet I could not shun it; for memory, inescapable memory, would not be quieted. And with the recollection of the past came thoughts of the future, which agitated me almost beyond endurance. I felt too, that although I was not exactly a prisoner, I was carefully watched—knew, in my own heart, that Father Huestace had communicated to Father Kewlinn the suspicions which he, doubtless, entertained of me.</p>
               <p>At length, however, I fell asleep; and my last thought was a prayer for Madelon, and an earnest hope for our escape. I realized then that I owed her much—much in the shape of atonement. Could I repay her? I thought.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
               <p>Some time towards morning I was awoke by a noise in Madelon's room. It was slight, but at that time my senses were painfully acute. I started straight up in bed and listened. A repetition of the noise brought me quickly, but silently, to the door of my apartment. I opened it the slightest crack possible, and concentrated all my energies in the sense of hearing. Directly I detected smothered voices. Some one was surely in her room. I could scarcely restrain myself, although my sober judgment counselled me to remain quiet. My heart beat quick, and my breath came thick and fast. There was a struggling—I could hear the shuffling of feet distinctly. In the midst of it a woman—and it could only be Madelon—exclaimed in tones of terror;—</p>
               <p>"They killed him!—will you now murder me, and in this brutal manner?"</p>
               <p>"Be quiet, girl, we don't intend to harm you!" hissed forth another, and that other I knew I to be Father Kewlinn.</p>
               <p>"Why do you come here, then? Is my room—poor as it is—common property? or are priests and monks—for such I see you are—without the pale of common decency or humanity? I have been half murdered already; could I not be left to die in peace?" Madelon exclaimed, indignantly "Shame, shame, upon you, cowards that you are, thus to hamper a weak woman. Away with you, or I will shriek aloud with all the strength that is left me!"</p>
               <p>She had recovered, and even seemed strong, for her words were bravely spoken, but uselessly. She knew not where she was, or that there little help could reach her.</p>
               <p>Again there was a scuffling; and then I heard Father Kewlinn bid his companions, whoever they were, bind Madelon's mouth. The prayer for mercy, that quivered upon her lips, was smothered by the coarse hand of a religious ruffian.</p>
               <p>In a moment or two I heard the door open slowly, and then the silent, measured tread of slippered feet<pb n="242-243" xml:id="VAC5820-00000125"/> upon the stairs. Directly the persons entered the hall, and a moment after turned the curve, and appeared in full view. Almost at glance, I took in the position of the parties. Two stern looking monks—Capuchins—held Madelon—one by the head, and the other by the feet—while Father Kewlinn led the way, carrying a dark lantern, the light of which he threw directly in front of him. Madelon's hands and feet were pinioned, and her mouth bandaged. Where were they taking her? and what were their intentions? I asked myself, but could not conjecture.</p>
               <p>As they approached the door of my room, which they had to pass, I silently closed it, and threw myself upon the bed. It was fortunate that I did so, for there the party, at a sign from the priest, came to a halt. My wonder at this proceeding was soon changed to anxiety, when I saw the door of my apartment silently open, and Father Kewlinn enter the room. He immediately drew near to the bed, and threw the strongest light of the lantern full in my face. I guessed his object, and defeated it by remaining perfectly quiescent.</p>
               <p>"He sleeps!" he muttered. "That is well. He will never know what became of the girl—whether she be dead or living—here or elsewhere; and that is what Brother Huestace desired."</p>
               <p>As quietly as he had entered, he quitted my apartment; and in a moment after, the slight pit-a-pat of slippered feet again fell upon my ear. Quickly I was at the door gazing after them.</p>
               <p>"Not know where she is? We shall see! We shall see!" I whispered to myself, yet scarcely knowing what I meant.</p>
               <p>As noiselessly as a cat, I emerged from my room, and crept down the hall after the priest and his associates.</p>
               <p>The position in which Father Kewlinn carried the lantern favored me greatly, the light being all in front, while in the rear it was almost impenetrably dark. The party being, thus exposed to me, I carefully watched all their actions. I soon observed that Madelon occasionally struggled, but confined and surrounded as she was, it was folly to resist.</p>
               <p>On, and on, they went; and down, and down, they went, into the cold, damp, mucky Vault beneath the building. By this time I had crept up closer to the party, and entered the cellar only a little way behind, them, the door, fortunately, opening and closing without so much as a creak.</p>
               <pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC5820-00000126"/>
               <p>The vault was large, occupying, as it did, about three-fourths of the space upon which the building stood. Father Kewlinn, and the monks bearing, Madelon, proceeded directly towards the upper end of the cellar.</p>
               <p>"Are they going to murder her in this horrid place?" I asked myself.</p>
               <p>The thought had barely flashed through my mind, when Father Kewlinn halted in front of an iron door, which was deeply imbedded in the thick; walls of the cellar. Removing what seemed to be, and really was, a heavy key, from his bosom, he unlocked the stout door, and carefully threw it open. A cold blast of wind swept past me, and made me shudder. The whole party then passed through the door, and went on without closing it, the priest apparently not giving the circumstance a single thought. With an exclamation of joy, I followed on. I immediately found myself in what appeared to be a tunnel, but whither it lead, or what was its use, I could not at that moment imagine. It was barely high enough to permit of a good-sized man standing erect; but sufficiently wide to admit of three or four persons walking abreast. The atmosphere was even damper than in the vault beneath the Seminary; and as I groped along close up to the rough stone-wall, I experienced a sensation of coldness that seemed to penetrate even into my heart.</p>
               <p>In consequence of the extreme darkness which surrounded me—the priest's light but glimmering in the distance like a far-off star in a black sky—I occasionally stumbled over objects in my path—what, I knew not.</p>
               <p>The noise thus created was but slight, and yet sufficient to arrest the attention of Father Kewlinn, who would halt, and casting the light of the lantern behind him, peer into the surrounding darkness. Once, the object I struck seemed larger than usual, and the noise was consequently in proportion. Father Kewlinn turned round suddenly, and after a momentary pause, during which he addressed some words to the monks, he began to retrace his steps. As he drew near me, I backed off; and, at length, finding nothing out of the way he returned to his associates. I followed on again. Directly my foot touched the same object it had before encountered, but being more prepared this time, I shunned the noise. Unconsciously I bent down, and picked it up. A single touch was sufficient to inform me of its character, and I laid it quickly down again. It was the skull of a human<pb n="246-247" xml:id="VAC5820-00000127"/> being, and probably—so I began to think—not the first I had stumbled over during my progress through the tunnel.</p>
               <p>And still on, and on, we went; and only occasionally the deep silence was broken by some such occurrence as I have just related.</p>
               <p>In a little while I again crept up closer to Father Kewlinn and his party, every moment growing more anxious as to the result of their strange conduct. We had now been walking for some time, and I began to think the place interminable.</p>
               <p>Occasionally Madelon would struggle—sometimes violently. Once, shortly after the incident which I have just related, she managed, how, has ever been a wonder to me, to remove the bandage from over her mouth, sufficiently to admit of her venting a shriek. And such a scream as rent that dark place seldom strikes upon the human ear. It was like the deeply agonizing cry of a wretch tottering upon the brink of a yawning precipice ere his last leap into the boiling gulf beneath. It was fearful, and for a moment or two the party seemed paralyzed.</p>
               <p>Directly, and of a sudden, I saw the reflection of an arm upon the spot of light which surrounded Father Kewlinn and his companions. A quick thought, too monstrous to harbor, flashed through my mind. God, I thought, can it be? and then the arm descended with a quick motion, and the <emph>blow</emph>—for such I instantly realized it to be—was followed by a low, deep moan. The heartless priest had stricken the poor, weak girl, full in the face. She did not trouble him after that.</p>
               <p>I could not tell to what extent Madelon was injured, but the brutality of the act was almost without a parallel. The savage Indian in all his native fierceness could scarcely have done worse.</p>
               <p>At the moment the scream occurred, and the cowardly blow was dealt, a carriage, which was rattling through the street overhead, stopped. I could hear it plainly, as the occupants had, doubtless, heard Madelon's agonizing cry. For a few moments the party in the tunnel remained perfectly quiet, and, at length, the carriage drove off, the occupants, very likely, entirely unable to account for the mysterious scream.</p>
               <p>What my feelings were, when the brutal indignity of a blow was perpetrated upon the person of Madelon, I am unable to describe. What my feelings were, too, when one single moment of reflection showed me, how vain and useless was any interference, at that time, on my part, is beyond language to<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC5820-00000128"/> express. I could have killed the base and cowardly priest, and never allowed him time to say, "God forgive me." I did start forward, but something which seemed to whisper in my heart, "not yet! not yet!" arrested my steps. The struggle was fierce, and great beads of perspiration hung upon my brow. At length, however, I curbed my feelings, and settled down again into comparative quiet.</p>
               <p>As soon as the carriage passed on, Father Kewlinn moved and spoke. Madelon was, of course, unconscious, and in her weak condition it is only a wonder that the blow was not instant death to her.</p>
               <p>"I was compelled to resort to such a course," said the priest, apologetically; but why I could never determine, for undoubtedly his assistants would have done just the same thing, under the same circumstances. "It is already rumored,"—he continued,—"that screams and singular noises, which seem to issue from the ground, have been heard in this quarter; and such being the case, it was imperiously necessary to silence her voice, and quickly; and how else could I effectually accomplish that end? Now replace the bandage over her mouth, for fear that she should again revive, and let us on. The air chills me."</p>
               <p>The priest's command leaving been obeyed, the party once more started forward, and at a more rapid rate. Their quaking hearts quickened their steps.</p>
               <p>In a short time, they again halted, and I crept up to within a very short distance of them. They were now standing before another iron door, which likewise appeared to be, and really was, imbedded in another end wall of the tunnel. I now began to suspect whither the underground passage led. It, doubtless, formed a connection between the Seminary and the Nunnery, and enabled the occupants of the former, the better to carry on their often unchristianlike and ungodly practices.</p>
               <p>While Father Kewlinn busied himself in getting out the key, and unlocking the heavy door, the attention of the whole party beings concentrated on what was before, and not behind them, I drew myself up so close, that had they listened, they could almost have detected my breathing.</p>
               <p>In a moment the door swung inward, and revealed what was beyond. From my position I could discern things quite distinctly. The space beyond appeared to be a large vault, similar to the one under the Seminary.</p>
               <p>As Father Kewlinn and his party passed through, I found myself in complete darkness, with the exception<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC5820-00000129"/> tion of the little gleam of light that shone through the door, and struck lengthwise upon the damp earth-floor beyond. In a moment the door slowly moved on its hinges—I sprang lightly forward—too late—it closed with a dull and heavy sound. I looked around affrighted—the darkness was intense, and almost overpowering. I again turned to the door, thinking that I might open it and press through, for I had not heard them lock it. My hand was already upon the heavy iron knob, when the bolt in the lock slowly turned in the socket, and cut off all my chances of penetrating any further. They must have returned, for I feel confident that they had passed on some distance. Second thought had probably induced the priest to be more cautious.</p>
               <p>I leaned a against the cold, wet wall, despairingly; and though I well enough knew, that the door at the other end of the tunnel was open, I made no effort to retrace my steps. So occupied was I, that the thought did not strike me. In that moment the mystery of the priest's conduct absorbed my every faculty—even my own possible danger was forgotten. I could not relinquish the pursuit of Madelon. Some irresistible power rivetted me to the spot. He seemed to have but one single idea, and that was beyond my power to direct or control trol. Was it <emph>Fate</emph>? and if not <emph>Fate</emph>, what else?—that enchained my feet, and in the fullness of one thought obliterated every other? It almost, indeed, seemed so.</p>
               <p>I waited, and waited, close up to that heavy iron-door and yet I scarcely knew why. And thus passed the moments, slowly and heavily, for it was a cold, dark, dreary vigil.</p>
               <p>Directly, for though the time seemed long to me, it could not have really been so, I was startled by a fumbling at the iron-door. Anon, the bolt began to recede in the lock—then the door commenced to open slowly, and finally a stream of light again gleamed into the dark tunnel. I sank down close in the corner, almost rolling myself up into a ball. All instant after, and Father Kewlinn, together with the two monks, stepped into the passage, the former stopping to close the door and lock it. What have they done with Madelon? I asked myself, and shuddered to think that my efforts to penetrate her new hiding-place were fruitless. That she had been lodged in the Nunnery I felt convinced; but still I was not certain. And what her fate would be there, was equally a matter of conjecture. I trembled to think that I could not assist her, as I had resolved to do. All that I had<pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC5820-00000130"/> obtained, was a knowledge of Madelon's removal from the Seminary. She might be confined in the Nunnery, or she might be taken far a-way out of the city, for all that I would know, as I was then situated. And even if I had penetrated beyond the second iron-door, I might have done much more harm, than good to both Madelon and myself. Altogether I began to feel that I was powerless.</p>
               <p>Abreast, the three men, the priest, in the centre, passed on towards the other end of the passage. I followed them quickly, and with a cat-like step. Tramp—tramp—tramp, with a noiseless tread, and without uttering a word, Father Kewlinn, and his monkish <choice>
                     <sic>satelites</sic>
                     <corr>satellites</corr>
                  </choice> marched on. I wished that they would speak, and say something of Madelon—but everything was against me—they uttered not a syllable.</p>
               <p>At length the light from the priest's lantern struck upon the door which communicated with the vault beneath the Seminary. A few steps further, and they halted before it. I stopped too, and clung close to the wall. The door was still open, and the three men quietly passed through. Father Kewlinn himself stopped in the door-way, and placed the key in the lock. As he did so, a horrid thought flashed with lightning swiftness through my mind. What if he should lock it? And that he would do so, was but to be expected. I should then be a prisoner in the cold, dark tunnel. I had not thought of that before. With all my feelings fearfully intensified, I watched the motions of the priest. A moment only elapsed, when he drew the door to, and closed it. I rushed forward wildly and leaned against the iron-barricade, listening. Great God! the lock turned; it struck like death to my heart, for I was a prisoner in the horrid passage. I dare not cry out, for to betray what I had done, would, most likely, be but to call down instant vengeance upon my head. What would become of me? I should die there—die of cold and hunger, if I did not soon get out.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
               <p>I need not recapitulate all my agony—all my sufferings while confined in that, to me, dreadful place. It was too intensely dark to walk, and yet I was compelled to keep in motion, to prevent the cold air from overpowering me. Time passed on painfully slow, and all the while no hope, no prospect of release.</p>
               <p>I knew that in the world above, at last the light of day was shining; for I could hear the vehicles passing and re-passing overhead, and occasionally catch the sound of a human voice—but to me all was dark, dark night. I wandered up and down—groping my way hither and thither-sometimes moaning with anguish, and sometimes weeping with despair. My feet and legs grew numb with cold, while my head burned with a violent fever. But that I possessed a strong and unimpaired constitution, I should have sunk down and died. As it was, the struggle was doubtful.</p>
               <p>As time passed away, the gnawings of hunger began to rend my bosom, and add to my other sufferings; and my heart beat dreadfully with the overwhelming intensity of my feelings. At length, I felt—though I had no means of knowing—that the day must be passed, by the great length of time I had been locked up. And yet there was no chance of escape—no one visited the tunnel.</p>
               <p>I knew that I had grown thin, and pale, and haggard, even in the short time that I had been confined in that dreadful place; and I could feel, though I could not see, the alteration in my appearance. Such feelings as agitated my heart soon produce a visible effect.</p>
               <p>You may wonder that I was not missed in the Seminary, and searched for. Doubtless I was. But in the tunnel would have been the last place they would have thought of looking for me. The reasons are obvious. I was a stranger but just arrived, and consequently could not be supposed to know of its existence.</p>
               <p>At length, after the lapse of an almost unbearable space of time, my heart leaped into my throat, for my quick ear detected the approach of some person in the vault under the Seminary. It sounded as joyfully to<pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC5820-00000132"/> me as "pardon" does to the poor criminal in his dreary dungeon. And yet it might not betoken safety. I heard the key placed in the lock, and I crouched down again close to the wall; the bolt was slowly withdrawn; the door opened, and the light of a lantern again illuminated that black cavern. One person only appeared in the doorway. For a moment the light blinded me; but soon recovering my faculties, I cast my eyes upon the intruder. I almost cried aloud, as I recognized the visitor.</p>
               <p>"He here, and so soon!" I thought, as my straining eyes fell upon the dark and furrowed countenance of Father Huestace. "The end then is come"—so ran my reflections—"and I was not held a captive here for nothing. Deep, dark, inscrutable destiny is at work."</p>
               <p>Father Huestace did not stop to lock the great door, but only closing it, passed on. His mind appeared to be absorbed, and the abstraction of his manner led me to hope that he would pursue the same course with the other door; as I felt confident that it was his intention to visit Madelon, wherever she was; and I had determined upon following him, let the issue be what it might.</p>
               <p>On we went, with but the space of a dozen yards between us. Little did the plotting and unscrupulous priest imagine who was dogging his steps. As I have said before, I was an altered person then; and though not yet what I should be, a wise God had made apparent to my mind the errors of my creed. I hated priests—hated Romanism—almost hated myself for the life I had mis-spent—trebly hated Father Huestace for the great influence which he had hitherto exercised over me to my degradation.</p>
               <p>The Jesuit was arrayed in the garments generally in vogue, with the exception of the dressing of the feet, which consisted of a description of thick, but pliant moccasin. His head was ornamented with a tight fitting black velvet cap—an article in common use among the Catholic clergy. In personal appearance he was the same as when I last saw him; and judging from his wrinkled brow and compressed lips, his feelings still maintained about the same balance.</p>
               <p>At length, he drew near to the other end of the tunnel, and finally the reflections of the light struck upon the iron pivots in the cumbrous door. Hitherto Father Huestace had pursued his way with his head bowed down, as if in deep meditation; now he raised his face, and looked anxiously around. A few steps more brought him in direct contact with the<pb n="258-259" xml:id="VAC5820-00000133"/> barrier. Placing the lantern upon the ground, he removed the key from his bosom, and unlocked the door. Again my eyes penetrated the great vault beyond. Father Huestace then took up the lantern, and passed through the aperture. I reached the door just in time to see it close. Again I was surrounded with intense darkness; but I thought not of that—another feeling filled my heart; would he lock the door? felt that if he did, I should shriek aloud with the mad agony of my emotions. I bent my head down and listened. Hist! a step—light as a feather—but still a step. Thank God, he passes on without locking it! was my inward congratulation. I drew a long, long breath, and then seized the heavy knob of the door. Slowly I turned it; and by degrees pushed back the distance of a foot probably. It was a critical moment for me, but I did not shake or falter. Pushing my body through I entered the vault, an then silently closed the door. It was a miracle how I ever accomplished the feat, without attracting the priest's attention. But the dark shadow of destiny rolled up between the Jesuit and myself.</p>
               <p>As I emerged into the cellar, Father Huestace was just in the act of ascending a flight of stairs at the farthest extremity. With a rapid but silent movement I drew near to the spot, reaching it just in time to see him pass through a trap and disappear. I ascended the steps as quick as a flash, and placed my ear to the trap. The shutting of a door, which was barely audible, advised me of the priest's disappearance from the room, with which the trap evidently communicated. I listened again—all was still as the grave. Slowly I pushed up the trap and peeped into the room. A gush of warm air pleasantly contrasted with the cold atmosphere of the damp vault. The apartment was dark, and not a sound disturbed the heavy silence. A gleam of light which shone through a crack, informed me of the direction in which Father Huestace had gone. Dragging myself through the trap; I crawled into the room on my hands and knees. Following the streak of light I came to a door, which I softly opened, and emerged into a hall from which a flight of winding stairs led, as I correctly judged, into the upper portions of the Nunnery; for in that building I felt positive I was. What I had already seen confirmed my previous suppositions.</p>
               <p>The Jesuit was just winding around the top of the first flight of stairs, for I had gained upon him rapidly. I drew back until he had passed the turn, and then crept, with a noiseless tread, after him. I believe<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC5820-00000134"/> lieve that I could have struck him down, and killed him, at any moment, and without a struggle; but even then, my mind did not contemplate murder—was not, in fact fixed upon anything further than to watch the now hateful Jesuit.</p>
               <p>The second flight of stairs brought us—for I followed close behind Father Huestace—to another long, dark hall. The priest turned to the right and passed on. As yet we had not encountered a living soul, or heard the slightest noise. And yet I knew that beneath that ponderous roof were many sleepless eyes—many wakeful hearts, throbbing with feelings of unutterable passion, or unutterable agony.</p>
               <p>From the manner in which the Jesuit proceeded, I concluded that his visit was at once expected, and arranged by some one in the building—some one, too, who had power. What was his intention I could but guess. No good—that was as certain as destiny itself.</p>
               <p>On either side of the Passage in which I then found myself, were a number of doors communicating, as I well knew, with the Nun's cells. At none of these, however, did Father Huestace stop; but with a rapid motion he passed onward. Directly he disappeared. On arriving at the point at which I had last seen him, found that the passage abruptly turned off to the left, and appeared to lead round into another, and less frequented portion of the building. The Jesuit was just in advance of me.</p>
               <p>Suddenly Father Huestace stopped, and stooping to the keyhole of a solitary room, listened for some moments very attentively. Then he applied his eye to the same aperture, and finally set down the lantern, drew a small key from his pocket, applied it to the lock, opened the door softly, and disappeared within. And either from a sense of security, or the pre-occupation of his mind by other thoughts, he entered the room, without locking the door after him.</p>
               <p>In an instant after his disappearance, my eye was pressed to the keyhole. The view, within was partly obscured, but still I could manage to distinguish the occupants of the room, and mark their conduct.</p>
               <p>As I suspected, the apartment was Madelon's prison—for to her it was little else. My previous excitement, which had somewhat subsided during my chase of the Jesuit, now began to creep over me again. Once more my blood boiled—my temples throbbed, and my heart palpitated wildly.</p>
               <p>Evidently the girl had been asleep, and the light put out. When I applied my eye to the keyhole, Madelon<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC5820-00000135"/> delon, white as a marble statue, and still clad in the solemn grave-robe, was reclining upon the side of the bed, with her eyes fixed upon the motions of the priest, as if fascinated. Father Huestace had removed the candle from the tin-lantern, and was just in the act of depositing the former upon a rough table which stood against the wall. This was the position of things.</p>
               <p>It was a picture. Within the shadowy room the dark, mendacious priest, and the pale, persecuted woman; without, crouching down, and peering through the keyhole, the thin and haggard spy.</p>
               <p>Father Huestace soon turned from the table and faced the marble looking woman. There was in his steady gaze a fearful combination of bad passions, inexplicable to all but himself. Hate, however—and such a hate, as none but the very fiends experience—predominated. And he had, doubtless, come there to gratify the feeling—gratify it in the worst form. Madelon, as she looked upon him, shook as with a chill. The basilisk eyes of death could not, for the moment, have held her more spell-bound.</p>
               <p>Thus they stood for a brief space.</p>
               <p>"Madelon!" said the Jesuit, at length, in low tones.</p>
               <p>No answer.</p>
               <p>"Madelon!" he repeated, in a louder key.</p>
               <p>Still no answer.</p>
               <p>And the girl never removed her eyes from his face, or stirred a limb.</p>
               <p>"Madelon!" he reiterated again, and this time loudly and angrily.</p>
               <p>The girl started, and drew her thin, white hand across her eyes, as if just awaking from a dream. There was a moment of deep and solemn silence.</p>
               <p>"Who calls Madelon?" she repeated, slowly and quietly.</p>
               <p>"One who may be her friend or foe, as she wills," responded the Jesuit, softly and hypocritically.</p>
               <p>There was another moment of silence, and Madelon's eyes, from wandering around the room, finally settled upon the dark visage of Father Huestace.</p>
               <p>"You!" exclaimed the girl, with almost a shriek; and at the same time she slid from the bed and stood erect upon the floor, the fore-finger of her left hand pointing towards the priest.</p>
               <p>There was a quivering of the muscles in the face of Father Huestace, and already his breast began to surge with rising passion.</p>
               <p>"Just like her mother!" he hissed, between his clenched teeth.</p>
               <pb n="264-265" xml:id="VAC5820-00000136"/>
               <p>The words seemed to concentrate and intensify all the whole energy, passion, despair, and grief of the girl's nature.</p>
               <p>"Yes, vile priest,"—she cried, in, tones of withering scorn—"just like my mother. Like that mother whom you basely sought to rob of life's best jewel—its brightest ornament; you see I know you; like that mother who out of revenge you tormented—but not openly—to death; like that mother whose blessed spirit now hovers over her child, and gives her strength to brand you with your myriad crimes. I know you well—well! The dark face that frightened my childhood, has never escaped my memory. It is there! there!"</p>
               <p>She pointed to the priest's working countenance.</p>
               <p>"Mad girl, you know not what you do!" he hissed out, and his whole frame quivered.</p>
               <p>In that moment the Jesuit looked not like a human being. His fingers worked; his lips, lividly white, trembled violently; his eyes stood out like balls of fire; and the great veins on his forehead looked like dark chords. He was the very personification of unhallowed passion. Madelon, too, was madly excited; while my feelings almost defied restraint.</p>
               <p>"Wrong, wrong!" continued the girl, with intense wildness; "and yet I have not you to thank that I do. Hearken to my words, base, ignoble priest; for the true God has given me power to speak; me, a weak, trembling, sick, and dying, girl. Not content with murdering the mother, you have sought to rob and murder the child—me, the image of her, beneath whose scornful gaze your vile soul shrunk to nothing—me, who inherited the wealth, which enriched the mother, whom you could not degrade. And not content with all this—"</p>
               <p>"Devil!" shouted the priest, almost crazed by the girl's reproachful words; "cease, or your words will yet provoke your death!"</p>
               <p>As he spoke he raised his arm and strode towards her.</p>
               <p>"Approach me not, accursed man!" cried Madelon, with passionate dignity. "Off—off!—or the weight of your sins will strike you dead!"</p>
               <p>He stopped abruptly. There was something in the girl's manner, more than her words, that would have terrified a greater villain than even the Jesuit.</p>
               <p>"And not content with all this, I say,"—continued Madelon, undaunted—"you murdered another—one whom I loved, and who loved me—one who never wronged you—one whose <emph>mother</emph> never turned you<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC5820-00000137"/> forth from beneath the roof your presence had polluted—one whose only fault was, that he loved her whose mother scorned your base proposals—she, whose wealth tempted your cupidity. O, Frank, Frank,"—and Madelon wound her white hands through her dark hair—"I can almost fancy that I see you now, struggling in the cold waters—struggling for that life which was so dear to me; and here, here before me"—again she turned wildly upon the priest—"stands the dark man who <emph>murdered</emph> you. Will not your pure spirit rise up to curse him, as I do now?"</p>
               <p>Falling upon her knees, she lifted her eyes upward, and stretched forth both her hands wildly. In that moment, that pale woman looked supernaturally holy.</p>
               <p>"Maledictions on your cursed tongue!" cried Father Huestace, clenching his hand and shaking it towards Madelon.</p>
               <p>And yet he seemed grown to the spot—held spellbound by the whirlwind of the girl's agony.</p>
               <p>"O, God, the Father, hear me!" continued Madelon, appealing to high heaven; "let not this bad man escape the punishment of his sins—let him not live to blast the earth with more wrong, more murder; palsy the hand that robs innocence of virtue—put out the mind that brings forth only that which is sinful and corrupt; and still the voice that breathes forth naught but rapine and murder. Earth is weary of the monster, and the spirits of his slain victims circle him about, and cry aloud for vengeance—vengeance!"</p>
               <p>My own feelings had by this time become so deeply enlisted, and my emotions so powerfully agitated, that my limbs would scarcely support the weight of my body.</p>
               <p>Madelon had barely concluded her appeal, when the now infuriated priest sprang towards her. Eternal Truth had pierced even his callous heart; but instead of deterring, it only urged him on to new scenes of violence.</p>
               <p>"Be that word the last you shall shriek in my ear, proud, defiant woman,!" he shouted, terribly.</p>
               <p>There was a blow—a faint scream—a running of blood. The priest had stricken the girl with the heavy iron-key which opened the doors of the tunnel. I looked on horrified, for my mind was not prepared for such a sight. For some moments I could scarcely comprehend what had occurred. At length the reality burst upon me.</p>
               <p>With the yell off a madman I dashed into the room. The Jesuit turned and glared at me affrighted; and<pb n="268 (Illustration) " xml:id="VAC5820-00000138"/> Madelon fell quivering to the floor, her white clothes dyed with the purple stream.</p>
               <p>"Mother—Frank—I come!" she murmured faintly—gasped for breath—moaned, and died.</p>
               <p>In that terrible moment, so fatally consecrated to blood and murder, that poor, persecuted girl thought only of those whom she had loved, and who had loved her. Even as her spirit, pure, and holy, and undefiled, tottered upon the brink <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Of that tremendous precipice, whose depth</l>
                        <l>No thought of man can fathom,"</l>
                     </lg>
                  </q> her final living thought lingered lovingly around the memory of those who in her tender heart she recognized as nearest and dearest.</p>
               <p>There, was a deep, oppressive pause.</p>
               <p>I turned to the priest—our eyes met, and for an instant our gaze was fixed.</p>
               <p>"Fiend!" I shouted, crazy with the scene;—"behold another murder is committed—another victim is added to your long catalogue. The spirits of the many murdered are waiting to drag you down to hell. I hear their voices in the whispering air. They clamor for retribution. Come—come—come!"</p>
               <p>With a bound I was by the Jesuit's side, and with supernatural strength I seized him by the throat, and<figure>
                     <head>Death of Madelon Hawley and Father Huestace.</head>
                  </figure>
                  <pb n="-269" xml:id="VAC5820-00000139"/> bore him to the floor. Then dragging him across the room to where the bloody Madelon lay, I held his face down to her's, and again hissed "murderer" in his ear. And all the while my grasp upon his throat tightened. All the accumulating hatred of the past was concentrated in that grip, and I experienced a maniacal joy, as I felt the priest's writhings and twistings, and gazed into his fast bloating countenance.</p>
               <p>But he was a strong man, was Father Huestace; and in great despair he made a terrible struggle for his life. The madness of the moments had made a giant of me, but the spring of the priest took me by surprise. For a moment he escaped my grasp, and shrieked with all the intensity of a lost soul. But that cry was his last. Bounding upon him with all the ferocity of a madman, I again bore him to the floor, and twisted my fingers about his neck.</p>
               <p>A shuffling of many feet, and an echoed exclamation in the room, attracted my attention. I looked up from the body of the Jesuit. Around me were gathered several priests and monks. How it happened that they, were so prompt on the first alarm, and what they were doing in the Nunnery at that time of night—for I now think that it must have been near<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC5820-00000140"/> on to the mid-hour—I leave you to conjecture. My brain was too hot to think of anything then. I saw them there, and that was all I knew. From them I turned again to Father Huestace, whose throat I still grasped. He was quiet and immoveable. In speechless silence several moments elapsed. At length there was another bustling at the door, and then Father Kewlinn followed by several priests hurried into the room. And lastly the Lady Abbess, with some other heads of the establishment, appeared upon the scene. I remembered it all afterwards. There was much confusion, horror and dismay. The priests in the Seminary had evidently been alarmed by some one—hence their sudden and abrupt appearance.</p>
               <p>And still I bent down over Father Huestace—maddened.</p>
               <p>"Blessed Virgin, what a dreadful sight!" exclaimed a female voice, each tone instinct with terror.</p>
               <p>"A double murder! horror!" echoed another, and a deeper voice—the voice of a novice, probably, or he would not have been so moved.</p>
               <p>"How came he here?" the Lady Abbess inquired, anxiously, pointing at me, and appealing to Father <choice>
                     <sic>Kewlin</sic>
                     <corr>Kewlinn</corr>
                  </choice>. "In what manner did he obtain access here? Not by the usual way, that I am certain." Without waiting ing for a reply, she continued, "what a dreadful deed, and how frightful the man looks. Take him away!—take him away, or he may kill somebody else."</p>
               <p>"Seize him!" cried Father Kewlinn, thus aroused;—"seize the renegade priest!"</p>
               <p>There was a groan of horror passed from mouth to mouth. At the same moment I cast Father Huestace from me and sprang to my feet. I, too, was aroused. The body of the priest fell to the floor like a stone. He was dead.</p>
               <p>I sprang forward, but was instantly surrounded. There was a fierce struggle, and I remember nothing more. All was oblivion and darkness.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
               <p>WEEKS passed before I returned to consciousness. When I did I found that I was in a strange place; but still surrounded by the priests, and encompassed by the power of the Romish Church.</p>
               <p>The fever of my brain had abated, but not so the hate I felt for priests and priestcraft. Nor could I avoid displaying the revolution which circumstances had wrought in my feelings. For that I in turn was hated.</p>
               <p>From the moment of my revival I was subjected to a persecution of the most fiendish and devilish character. I was looked upon, as an apostates—a renegade; and my body was subjected to all the tortures their ingenuity could invent; and their cunning is never at a loss. I bore it as patiently, with as much fortitude, as human flesh could. At length I discovered where I was—which for a long time I knew not. My place of confinement was a farm-house attached to the Seminary, but some miles distant. With the discovery came a resolution to escape; and, after much pondering, I could see but one way to accomplish that; for I was too closely guarded to admit of many chances.</p>
               <p>One dark night, having collected together all the combustible material I could find in my room, I fired the building. In the confusion I escaped to the woods and concealed myself. Weeks after, having endured unspeakable hardships and deprivations, I reached the Indian country, in the far, far west. I claimed fellowship with the red men, and was received among them. They liked me, and I was elected their medicine-man. From that hour I sought earnestly to atone for the past. I tried to do all the good that was in my power. In the grand old woods I worshipped God untrammelled by creed or superstition—in the solitude of the wilderness I sought forgiveness for the misdeeds of the past.</p>
               <p>Years passed away, and a measure of peace, sweet peace, came at last. With that feeling of inward quiet there came also a strange and unaccountable desire to revisit this city. I could not suppress it; and at length I gratified the yearning. I had amassed<pb n="274-275" xml:id="VAC5820-00000142"/> ed some little money by trafficking in furs; and so I left my friends, the Indians, and travelled here; but the scenes, and the people, all were changed. I, too, was changed; for I was old, and bent, and wrinkled. They who knew me years before, knew me not then; nor did I wish it otherwise. I took up my lodging here, and from that time I have lived alone and almost unknown.</p>
               <p>My old employer, Madelon's aunt, and many others who had mingled in life's busy scenes long years before, slept the silent sleep that knows no waking. Charles Hawley had grown gray during my absence; and Anna Sinclair was married and living in the east. These things I learned by degrees from hearsay. Winnie had grown quite matronly, was married too, and had a family of interesting children around her. Her husband was an honest, deserving mechanic. I was glad to know that she had not taken my desertion much to heart. I have seen her frequently, but she never recognizes in the bent-old man the dashing and deceitful Joseph of other days. Patrick—and you, doubtless, can remember the circumstance, for it has not been many years since, and created much excitement at the time—was convicted of the murder of two women, and afterwards hung. The Church could not save him then, and no Father Huestace was at hand. As he had lived, he perished; confident in the miraculous power of the priest, and the infallibility of his religion.</p>
               <p>Upon the breaking up of the river, which was late in the season, the body of Frank Sinclair—who had long been mourned as dead—was found, and recognized by the clothing; but nothing was ever learned of the manner of his death. Patrick died without revealing a word—true to one thing at least. Madelon's estate, after much trouble and bickering, and after the lapse of several years, was finally secured by the agents of the Church.</p>
               <p>All now is told—the mystery of a plot, and the history of a foul wrong is bared to your gaze. My soul is lighter, that the weight of secresy is lifted from it. For the wrong that I did to Madelon and her friends I have deeply, deeply repented; for the death of Father Huestace no man would hold me responsible—surely then not a just God. Little more remains now to be told.</p>
               <p>Since my return, but little of importance has occurred to me—nothing connected with my narrative; except, indeed, that the gray old church no longer lifts its tall spire to the clouds; for a mass of crumbling<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC5820-00000143"/> ruins now marks the spot where once it stood. It will no more sin against God by harboring conspirators and murderers, even though they be priestly ones.</p>
               <p>I am done. My story is told, and finished none too soon, for death tugs impatiently at my heart. The span of my life is run; but in this final hour I can only glorify the Divine Master for the blessed privilege of repentance. He has allowed me years, long years, to wash out the stains of the past, and prepare for that future which is beyond the grave. Hallowed be His name, forever and ever, on earth and in heaven; for He is the true God—the only Lord and Master of us all.</p>
               <p>The weakness of dissolution prostrates alike my mind and body, and the last home of man opens its narrow door to admit me within. All things grow dim and vague; but in the vapory mist I see the shadows of an angel band. They beckon me away—away. I come! come!</p>
               <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
               <p>The old man had been gradually growing weaker and weaker; and at length his voice sank away into a faint whisper. Placing my arm, beneath his shoulder I removed the pillows, and laid his drooping head back. Then he closed his eyes slowly, and lay motionless.</p>
               <p>The light of day was just breaking in the east, and a pale silver gleam stole into the room, and rested upon his white face, and silvered brow.</p>
               <p>No sound disturbed the deep and solemn silence; for even the old man's breathing had almost entirely subsided. I bent down over the bed—the shadow of the grave rested upon the sleeper's brow. The pale visitor came to the old man kindly and gently, and the tried heart mildly admitted him. Anon, I rested my hand upon his pulseless heart, and in the fall conviction of his deep and earnest repentance, whispered: "Peace be with thee!"</p>
               <p>He was dead.</p>
