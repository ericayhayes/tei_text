A LETTER FROM THE AUTHOR TO T&#xD;
Mt. I'UBLISmHu:&#xD;
I send you, by the hands of&#xD;
4         'of Shoepacs, or, old-fashioned Canadian shoes.&#xD;
Happening to sojourn a few days recently a&#xD;
Detroit, I crossed over the beautiful straits w&#xD;
Canada, and there, to my surprise and delight, I f&#xD;
at a smart, modern, country shop. After I had&#xD;
humored old Frenchman  or "Kennuck "-passed&#xD;
heartily at my simplicity in making such a purc&#xD;
him earnestly that the celebrated La Salle, and th&#xD;
Marquette, nay, probably Montcalm himself, had&#xD;
laughed the more; and that too in spite of my&#xD;
that these men rere all highly distinguished in&#xD;
his own land-for he had never heard of one of&#xD;
him that I had once woru them myself, and that,&#xD;
the long and wintry road which led up to what 1&#xD;
I had secured thus far in life, he grew serious a&#xD;
enough to believe me-his gay humor rose even t&#xD;
On being questioned, he told me that Shoepacs&#xD;
the old-fashioned, humble people of this part of C&#xD;
earn their living by working in the woods, killing&#xD;
white fish. He remembered the very first Frenc&#xD;

that way, who laughed&#xD;
phase. When I assured&#xD;
e famous Hennepin and&#xD;
worn Shoepacs, he only&#xD;
word and honor for it&#xD;
the history of Canada,&#xD;
hem. But when I told&#xD;
with them, I had trod&#xD;

air of modern shoes ; and what a sensation he cr&#xD;

ard, waiting for the bell to ring fcr service, laughs&#xD;
ome even wickedly cracking eggs: and when the&#xD;
hey pointed them out to each other, exclaiming, a&#xD;
oom! room! and made way right and left, with&#xD;
tended ceremony, for the enviable possessor of such&#xD;
Ah, "room! room !" is the word that expressed&#xD;
northwest. The moccasin must make room for t&#xD;
Shoepac, in its turn, for the iron heel of the Briti&#xD;

SH OEPAC RECOLLECTIONS,.&#xD;
CHAPTER I.&#xD;
OUR CITY.&#xD;
OuRs was a little antiquated city. Its inhabitants&#xD;
were mostly F ench. At the time I came upon the&#xD;
stage of events, the transition to a modern American&#xD;
town had scarcely commenced. The body of the popm.&#xD;
lation was still f the ancient 4sgime. The few Ameri-&#xD;
cans were offices, or ex-officers, of either the general or&#xD;
territorial gove nment, and their families, relations,&#xD;
dependents, and friends, whom they had persuaded to&#xD;
venture beyond the "jumpingoff place," as Buffalo&#xD;
was then termed. The spirit of emigration had not&#xD;
been fully aroused ; and the spirit of speculation, if felt&#xD;
at all, was confided to the fur-traders, a class made up&#xD;
of all nations.&#xD;
I cannot compare the society more nearly than to that&#xD;
of some princip d East India Company station in a city&#xD;
of ilindostan. There were the governor of the terri-&#xD;

tory and his family, the judicial, executive, and military&#xD;
functionaries, with their families and dependents; like&#xD;
subahdar, nabobs, begums, and ;the lesser light_-&#xD;
traders and natives, French, Indian, and half-breed.&#xD;
But one could not well imagine a pleasanter state of&#xD;
feeling than mutually existed, with sufficient distinction&#xD;
between the different -castes er classes to prevent&#xD;
wrangling, and yet sucient community of interest,&#xD;
prejudice, and please  to make everybody sociable.&#xD;
The French gave a tone of gaiety-the military, bath'&#xD;
elevation and hospitality.  There were balls, where&#xD;
everybody danced with everybody's wife and. daugh-&#xD;
ter. There were theatr cals, where the most. dignified&#xD;
geihtlemen took parts. .t may be a mere whim, but I&#xD;
think I never have elsewhere met such easy polish and&#xD;
affability among.gentle- en.' There was no touchiness&#xD;
about position in the  ocial scale, and consequently&#xD;
neither stiffness nor a  station; and to this day, the&#xD;
same easy grace of man er is notable among the sons&#xD;
and daughters of the go d old city.,&#xD;
The traveller, journeying at that period from Kew&#xD;
Yqlwestward, after leaving Albany, penetrated into&#xD;
regions where civilization grew dimner and dimmer as&#xD;
he'advanced until he   ecame quite certain of having&#xD;
pased. the ultima thule, when he would stumble with&#xD;
astonishment on our littl community. There he would&#xD;
be welcomed with a courtesy no less 'gracious, anca,&#xD;

&#xD;
Yet there he&#xD;

Often he may meet on the sidewalk an Indian-so e&#xD;

Nature'sowpinoblemen erect and martial in his bear-&#xD;

heir handsome squawswile their own arms, ears, and&#xD;
noses would jixigle with silver ornaments; or, skuking&#xD;
along, some thievish craven of a Mennomonie, whose&#xD;
name was no le3 a term of reproach among the nobler&#xD;
tribes, than that of the Samaritan with the disdainful&#xD;
ch ldien of Judab. Passing above the town' he might&#xD;
find large conical, birch-bark tents pitched on the long&#xD;
slope of the river baik, and graceful, light pirogues&#xD;
dwn up in regular rows on the shore; these belong to&#xD;
thfi Indians, whom he may, if it chance to be payment&#xD;
eason, behold in hundreds, or even thousands, Succo-&#xD;
tash isboilingi huge iron or brass pets over the fires.&#xD;
A sma     rmy of famished, wolfish-looking dogs -lie&#xD;
arouniking lazily in the sun; and no smaller army&#xD;
xnaked children are running every where-smew&#xD;

with their heads strapped back, looking on the scene&#xD;

with wiSe, unw  king eyes; They seldom cry, and are&#xD;
no inapt representations of Patience on ,a mcnu .&#xD;

He would met pretty, fawn-faced young squaws&#xD;

phLyed more of the fierceness of the hawk than of the&#xD;
meekness of the dove, particularly when his anger was&#xD;
aroused by treachery or oppression. In the main, the&#xD;
children of the woods respected my father for his vir-&#xD;
tues, and thought him very honest-for a white man.&#xD;
The several children that clustered upon the parental&#xD;
boughs displayed; even at no late period of their child-&#xD;
history, greater or less evidence of their connection with&#xD;
the paternal trunk, not unmingled, however, with the&#xD;
tokens of my mother's excellence. In early. life, she&#xD;
appeared little other than warm affection and easy good&#xD;
humor; but time and trial proved that there lay dor-&#xD;
mant energy itself.&#xD;
There were four of' us: John, the eldest, had inherited&#xD;
his father's quick boldness of spirit ; my brother Gail-&#xD;
ford: his :more deliberate fire; Maud, our only sister,&#xD;
standing in age between John and Guilford, gave signs&#xD;
of patience, tethered with courage, yet both disguised&#xD;
under a self-distrust, often laughable to behold, so super-&#xD;
fuous and surprising was it in its manifestations ; as for&#xD;
me, I may in all modesty be allowed to show myself out&#xD;
in the course of this eventful history.&#xD;

could prevail on my mother to disclose. Such, how-&#xD;
ever, was the fact. But I was the plainest, and, I rather&#xD;
suspect, the dullest of the family, and no favorite at first&#xD;
with even my excellent mother.. And so it may have&#xD;
happened, after all, .that I fell to my father for his sym-&#xD;
pathy and compassion. This gave me some pride, this&#xD;
apparent partiality over ,he other children;who, I always,&#xD;
fancied envying me. He always seated me next him-&#xD;
self at table, and cut up my food very nicely; and they&#xD;
have all since declared that this early care he took is the&#xD;
reason why I am an inch the tallest of the three&#xD;
brothers.&#xD;
I remember that there was a desk-is not that desk&#xD;
my own sacred property at this moment --with very&#xD;
tall legs, I then thought, standing in one corner of the&#xD;
room Mr. March used as his library, but which was our&#xD;
favorite.sitting-room. Whenever -he came home fro&#xD;
his business, and particularly after any long absence, h.&#xD;
would go straight to the desk, and draw forth cakes ani&#xD;
confections, or sometimes even a more valuable gift. It&#xD;
was always well known who for. At any rate, I knew&#xD;
better where they went than how they ever got there,&#xD;
which to -this day remains as perfect a mystery as the&#xD;
means by Phich the stones were laid at Baalbec.&#xD;
Then it was my peculiar destiny never to touch a dish&#xD;
of glass, or other breakable, without the ensuing of a&#xD;
crash.; and furthermore, it never was my good fortune&#xD;
to escape therefrom without an energetic thump of the&#xD;
thimbled finger of my mother, or a sly pinch "from my&#xD;

listless soul, that seems now to have come from an angel.&#xD;
Shortly afterwards came sorrow ; and Beauty and Sor-&#xD;
row have ever visits me together, like loving twin&#xD;
sisters.&#xD;
Our visit lasted a week. We set out to return at sun-&#xD;
set.  It was a beautiful moonlight night. The 'canoe&#xD;
was loaded down with the good things we brought away.&#xD;
There were bushels of hickory nuts, and a basket of&#xD;
hens' eggs, with some great goose eggs that took my eye&#xD;
-I had found them, too, hid away somewhere under the&#xD;
barn; some white wool for Mrs. March to spin and&#xD;
weave into home-made woolen sheets, a bag of the&#xD;
reddest apples inahe world, and a little box in which I&#xD;
brought home a pair of doves. But the air was laden&#xD;
with miasma. Mr. March, Maud, all of us except Mrs.&#xD;
March, were in a few days.successively prostrated with&#xD;
the fever. My mother nursed us all. Nothing seemed&#xD;
to bewilder or confound her. Nothing was too arduous&#xD;
for her to do. She was everywhere at the same moment.&#xD;
When the house grew still at night, she would suffer the&#xD;
,neighbors, who were ever ready, to relieve her.. But&#xD;
not a voice of pain issued from a roob ut 'it reached&#xD;
her ear, and she' stood over the bed *ith cooling drink&#xD;
or soothing balm. Her very hand was 'magical on my&#xD;
own heated temples.&#xD;
After a while, one after another recovered, save one-&#xD;
the one, the all in all to my mother and to me. I remem-&#xD;

sive.  The walls seemed neyer so wide apart-the&#xD;
ceiling never so high.  Objects became suddenly and&#xD;
largely  idealized. Thre seemed indeed a l'eight-it&#xD;
was heaven. There, too, were depths--profound depths,&#xD;
down which, I remember I would awake, as if falling,&#xD;
in my half-conscious moments. In fact, there suddenly&#xD;
rose around me a worli: I never had known it before&#xD;

NAtrat's resources were almost exhaust&#xD;
poor mother by the fatigues of many days'&#xD;
long-strained anxiety and much overwork. T&#xD;
and complete departure of hope would have&#xD;
her of the little remaining strength; but th&#xD;
loss of blood which followed the shock prostra&#xD;
completely, that her doleful wish to die were&#xD;
accomplished.  But all hope gone in one&#xD;
eaves the mind to fix itself on new objects;&#xD;
and better hope. And now to combat despair&#xD;
came desperate Resolution-to live for her&#xD;
and new. thoughts, sudden desires, new ene:&#xD;
new ambition, began to prevail.&#xD;
mother did not shut herself in her bedr&#xD;

grave.&#xD;
But what Was the prospect immediately stretching on&#xD;
before us&#xD;
Mr. March had eft his affairs in a poor way. Exten-&#xD;
sive as das his business, afl his means were employed&#xD;
ain schemes hich next-year he hoped to see produce&#xD;
the desired results: next ear, the ignis fate  of for-&#xD;
tune-hunters, the maid of the mist that draws them into&#xD;
the vortex: next year! the rock on which so many&#xD;
stately ships have split.  The mind to calculate, the&#xD;
hand to guid , were gone. Everything was found to be&#xD;
inextricably 'onfused, overharged, pledged, mortgaged,&#xD;
embarked- othing brought to port, nothing matured&#xD;
to hand and ready for use. The very house in which.&#xD;
we dwelt, a lrge English cottage built b~y himself', was&#xD;

" I shall need no pin-riaoney," he said, with a sigh,&#xD;
thinking of his mother and Maud.&#xD;
Professor March haddied. His death was announced&#xD;
to my father by Virginia, his eldest daughter, between&#xD;
whom and Mr. March a warm      correspondence had&#xD;
since been kept up, till the day of his illness. .e  had&#xD;
often visited the ladies; for on going to New York on&#xD;
yalbusiness, be never was so engrossed -as to lose.&#xD;
sight of the claims of friendship and kindred.  He&#xD;
always returned home with so ;much to', tell us : ,what&#xD;
great men he had .seen-Lafayette, or the eloquent&#xD;
Mr. Clay, whom he admired to the skies. In fat ahe&#xD;
frequently went to Washington for the;soleapurposO of&#xD;
seeing the world, which he thought less provincial at the&#xD;
political capitol than at the greater metropolis of .cm-&#xD;
merce. How he, a business man, could devote so much&#xD;
time' to his family, to his friends, and to the improve-&#xD;
ment of his noble nature, I cannot understand, since the&#xD;
spirit of present progress has seized me.&#xD;
" He had better have stuck to his business," snarls&#xD;
out Adolphus Fitz-Mammon of Pearl street.&#xD;
Perhaps he had.&#xD;
At any rate, confess we must, that there were we, his&#xD;
wedded wife, now a' Vpoor widow, and his lawful chil-&#xD;
dren, now penniless, at the foot of the ladder, about to&#xD;
start away on the ocean of life, and forced from the tart&#xD;
to paddle our own canoe.&#xD;

for our family pride, but for thy sake-that the back-&#xD;
ward st te of those times would n6t furnish Mrs. March&#xD;
with geiteel labor-embroidery, Tax-work, writing for&#xD;
newspapers or magazines, lecturin on.the rights of the&#xD;
softer sex, God bless them. Indeed there seemed to&#xD;
have been no machinery set in otion, by upheavings&#xD;
of the 4cial world, for raising the wind wherewithal to&#xD;
bear up conscious dignity, suffering under a cloud.&#xD;
These days of such blessed  o t-cuts to fortune and&#xD;
came ar paradisaical, when compared with those long,&#xD;
ol1-fashionel, .rugged roads up the hill.  With due&#xD;
shamefacedness, I confess that Mrs. IMarch, my mother,&#xD;
and ,he widow Qf a rather ,disti guished ian, took in&#xD;
washing. Though shrarelylen over the tub herself,&#xD;
yet many ,  night have I. laid s;n! g snder her ironing-&#xD;
table, yetending to sleep, so that she might feel free to&#xD;
sigh aloud in the midnight houa, as she wearily and&#xD;
heavily leant on the smoothing-iron.&#xD;
It was sixmonths after the gr at catastrophe before&#xD;
Mrs. March could, earning the ainly subsistence the&#xD;
while, 4o anything beyond ,getting John to Cambridge,&#xD;
with the fee necessary to enter .tbe preparatory school.&#xD;
During the remainder of this  ear, sufficient money&#xD;
must be sorsped tog her  r the firt payment due on&#xD;
tthc9 age which was once onr,0. n. The good people&#xD;
of th N   A alledit Lilac!tag M; t stood on the dge&#xD;

labor of each tiny hand, yet no sooner had Ithe blue-bird&#xD;
began to pipe for spring than my mother said we must&#xD;
make ready for school. .Accordingly, as soon as the&#xD;
weather settled a little, and the clamp earth began to&#xD;
grow dry, we started on a bright, breezy Moaday morn-&#xD;
ing for our schools-Maud one way, and Guilford and&#xD;
I another. The lilac bushes nodded us a morning fare-&#xD;
well as we set out.&#xD;
I do not remember that the boys; our schoolfellows,&#xD;
treated us any the worse afterI our misfortune. Boys&#xD;
are nobler little fellows than they are generally written&#xD;
-noisy, mischi vous rascals as they are. But Maud,&#xD;
on the other ha d, did mention,in a quiet, uncomplaining&#xD;
way, some notable instance of insolence off the part of&#xD;
her school companions.&#xD;
"I am not surprised, my de r," said Mrs. March;&#xD;
"we are very poor, and must not expect to escape the&#xD;
load of obloquy which poverty is liable to carry. Let&#xD;
your manners be simple, and your behavior aprtdent&#xD;
as I hope it may be innocent, and you will soori begin&#xD;
to see rise up around you a respect more v4,uable than&#xD;
that paid to mere wealth."&#xD;
We all looked on and listened with a sort of growing&#xD;
solemnity, till my mother closed this, the logest&#xD;
harangue of her life.&#xD;
It must be acknowledged, in extenuationof the en&#xD;

me a Scot that hath ever taught school, and I will shdw&#xD;
thee a pedagogue egregious and eternal. And Nfr.&#xD;
Magroy was a Scot and had taught school. With his&#xD;
Greek and his Latin, hip latitudes: and longitudes, Old&#xD;
Growl bestrode the world of classics and sciences, as he&#xD;
domineered over mankind's children. Who that went&#xD;
to school at that memorable time, but remembers the&#xD;
terrible visitor? And who that ever struck a plum from&#xD;
the bending boughs of his plum trees, that doth not&#xD;
repent in Greek and Latin to this day?&#xD;
Mr. Magroy was a father.&#xD;
The best natured, the most careless, idle, truant blade&#xD;
of a boy in the wliole city, was Allen Magroy, only&#xD;
child of Old Growl. Allen h d been the devoted&#xD;
admirer and sworn cavalier of dur Maud, ever sin e&#xD;

Then Allen began to wear a long face, and for the first&#xD;
time in his life looked serious. And poor Maud began to&#xD;
think she must not as much as look on an LL. . s'son,&#xD;
now that she was the daughter of a working woman ; and&#xD;
so treated Allen with quite chilling reserve, and avoided&#xD;
him on all possible occasions. Allen would throw him-&#xD;
self in her path between home and school, and on Sunday&#xD;
afternoons as she came back from church. She never&#xD;
so much as referred to Mr. Magroy, but she' potested&#xD;
against Allen's desperate behavior. In fact Maud was&#xD;
a great deal prouder than ever she knew of.&#xD;
Allen clungto her with Scotch pertinacity. He was&#xD;
now eighteen, amanly looking  fellow with 'dark hair&#xD;
and mahogany colored eyes; -he had a lithe figure, and&#xD;
there was that grand air about him in all his in olence,&#xD;
that we sometimes see with so much.pleasure in the&#xD;
strut of a gallant.soldier, as if he knew he had a perfect&#xD;
right to it. Yet as we have said, Allen was a careless,&#xD;
unstudious fellow, which was but too perceptible in the&#xD;
devil-may-care manner he carried about with him, except&#xD;
when in the presence of our sweet Maud. He was&#xD;
bound to her by no slender tie, viz., gratitude, a cable on&#xD;
the heart:of a boy, though soon reduced to a cobweb in&#xD;

an elm near by, and ellen had teased her all day. At&#xD;
length for the boyish fun of frightening her, he climbed&#xD;
part-way up the side of the well-house. Maud' grew&#xD;
frightened in a mome t.&#xD;
"Allen ! Allen! come down,-do!"&#xD;
The young gentleman was delighted too much with&#xD;
his easy success. He went laughing at her fears,&#xD;
climbed to the top of the open side, and was walking on&#xD;
the edge of the board, keeping his balance, however,&#xD;
with much effort..&#xD;

MY father's friend, M. Latrobe, was a French gentle-&#xD;
man; he rejoiced in it. He was born in Paris. le&#xD;
remembered Napoleon--had.'seen him, spoken with&#xD;
him.' Napoleon was his idol, of all hero divinities in&#xD;
clay. Every new day he told a new anecdote concern-&#xD;
ing the emperor.&#xD;
M. Latrobe was not tall-rather short and roundish.&#xD;
His years nuinbered fifty, and yet spring sat upon his&#xD;
face, laughing at winter on his head. He was a gentle-&#xD;
man of the old school, and handed you his snuff-box&#xD;
v*ith a polished air. His eyes were piercing black; his'&#xD;
mouth, sharp, -judicious little niuth, yet almost girl-..&#xD;

My mother was delighted to see him again ; and&#xD;
there they sat in the little library, so often the scene of&#xD;
pleasantries betw en him and my father, where so many&#xD;
adventures in boats, on snowshoes, and in shoepacs,*&#xD;
had been told, aid where Napoleon never had been for.&#xD;
gotten.&#xD;
" How are all our friends at Mackinac ?"'asked my&#xD;
mother.&#xD;
"Ah! madam" he replied in a softer tone, "you&#xD;
will pardon. my frendship in expressing myself before&#xD;
you, but the people up there loved your husban, ay&#xD;
friend, my friend; I think I see him here again&#xD;
M. Latrobe raised his eyes to the picture of my father&#xD;
with such affecti n, such sadness, depicted on his coun-&#xD;
tenance.&#xD;
"I am   ready to weep for you, madam-and for&#xD;
myself, too," he added, handing his snuff-box to  y&#xD;
mother, with a tear on the lid.&#xD;
The drops trickled down my mother's pale face'n&#xD;

her daily effort was to banish the past, for the sakef'&#xD;
the cares of the present, and God had helped heron. o&#xD;

intances when my mother's grief broke forth from her&#xD;
The two gentle spirits, knit together by love for a&#xD;
common object, buried their faces in their handker-&#xD;
chiefs, and wept.,&#xD;
.I. Latrobe was the first to speak. He told her of&#xD;
the interest manifested at Mackinaw in the f rtunes of&#xD;
my mother, and of, their grief over what was felt as a&#xD;
loss common to all. He spoke of a trunk-full of pre-&#xD;
sents they had sent her and Maud. The Indians had a&#xD;
superstitious reverence for Maud, on account of her&#xD;
hair. The Dove of Pigeon-Hawk was invested with&#xD;
unearthly attributes, and strings of wampum attested&#xD;
their homage.&#xD;
But M. Latrobe had a great favor. to ask.&#xD;
"I have long desired, madain, to place in your hands&#xD;
the keeping of my little daughter, Ma Belle."&#xD;
Mrs. March looked surprised-&#xD;
"Do not refuse me at once, wife of my old friend," he&#xD;
said, with the voice of one who most required sympathy,&#xD;
in attempting to bestow it. "Since the death of my&#xD;
excellent wife, I take little satisfaction at home, and ami&#xD;
absent so many months at once, I fear  a Belle will&#xD;
grow up in the streets.&#xD;
"My dear M. Latrobe," said my moth r, " is there&#xD;
anything I may do for your child ?"'&#xD;
".Ah  yes, madam, I desire her to be a lady, and&#xD;
that she must become by no more than 1ving in the&#xD;
same house with you."&#xD;

M, Latrobe ext ended his snuffbox&#xD;
" I fear you are too- polite," replied Mrs. March *h&#xD;
a smile, declining the good gentleman's snuff.&#xD;
"And I desire her to be educated," continued he.&#xD;
"Now, madam, if you would only take her'en fam ,&#xD;
.and send her to school under the kind protection  f&#xD;
Miss Maud, you would become my benefaetrs form m&#xD;

Who could refuse such an appeal?&#xD;
Then the good man became gay, talked of a lair'&#xD;
able upset from a canoe into the rapids of Sault bt&#xD;
Marie, and spoke of a queer, whimsical old officer, 0t&#xD;
toned at Mackinaiw, so as to slily draw in an apropo&#xD;
allusion or two to Napoleon.&#xD;
I am not sure that Father Robert would have enjoyed&#xD;
M. Latrobe's success that day-the lively, eagreeabl&#xD;
talker.&#xD;
As he rose to depart, he drew fi-om his breast pocke&#xD;
a package, and 1aid1it on the desk.&#xD;
" Compliment is compliment; business is business'&#xD;
said M. Latrobe, laconically. "You will find Ma&#xD;

bounced tA with difficulty under certain circumstances&#xD;
Mrs. March was not' quite prepared for pecuniary&#xD;

Her mother was a beautiful half-breed, who hadbeen&#xD;
finely educated at Mcntr al, where M. Latrobe married&#xD;
her. The half-breeds were not a long-lived race, and&#xD;
Madam Latrobe had died young, leaving' her husband&#xD;
this their only child-born late in their connubial hap-&#xD;
piness.&#xD;
The little one had been named Mabelle-my beautiful&#xD;
-by her mother, but we Anglicized it into Mabel.&#xD;
She seemed very glad to come among us, for her life&#xD;
had been lonely of late. Parting from her 'Frch nurse&#xD;
was a trial.  M. Latrobe, however, insisted so strongly,&#xD;
out. of regard to my mother, whose family was already&#xD;
sufficiently large that Mabel became i'econciled to it,&#xD;
and 'in order'that, the attachment should be completely&#xD;

the Protestant religion. I fear he was a poor sort of&#xD;
religionist, to lose. sight thus of his daughter's eternal&#xD;
interests ; but he had a strange opinion that there was but&#xD;
one God and one Saviour for bothichurches a belief which&#xD;
all sects would doubtless unite so far as to condemn&#xD;

&#xD;
"When I got to New York all I could do was to exclaim New York !&#xD;
New York! such great three story'buildings, such a great post-office, such&#xD;
banks, and so many people hurrying along. The shipping reminds me of&#xD;
a forest of pine trees ; yes, a perfect forest of then.&#xD;
Aunt Virginia was very  ad to see me, I think  I am glad you have&#xD;
sent her money enough for my board, schooling and everything for the&#xD;
year, as she is very poor. As you have not hear  anything about her&#xD;
except what she used to write herself, I will tell you what Aunt Carrie&#xD;
says. She says 'That V- was a great belle, and was quite celebrated at&#xD;
Washington, Philadelphia,New York, even way downto New Orleans, and'&#xD;
that  e had.many'offers '-which I can readily believe, as she is so good&#xD;
and lady-like in her manners, and so beautiful, toot even now in her 40th&#xD;
year. I will tell you and Maud just how she looks. Tall and straight,&#xD;
fine neck, and person, large black eyes, slightly aquiline nose, black ring-&#xD;
lets, an  such a musical ringing voice I never h ard. But she would&#xD;
accept  obody, rich men, learned professors, statesmen, nobody, so&#xD;
Aunt C. says. And what do you think is the reaso ? Why, Aunt Carrie&#xD;
is blindly, and has three little fatherless children, an Aunt V. has devoted&#xD;
herself to them all for life. Don't that sound like a omance ? It's almost&#xD;
like   , mother. Well, Aunt C's. husband left little or nothing, so Aunt V.&#xD;
who was unmarried when her father died, and left her everything, turned&#xD;
it all into enough money to purchase this little place of a house and six&#xD;
acres only, and here they live by raising vegetables which theysend to&#xD;
Boston market to sell. Aunt V.. did not know anything abbut it, but she&#xD;
got books, and read everything on such subjects, and now does very well&#xD;
indeed.&#xD;
"She teaches two of the children, the little girls, herself, and sends the&#xD;
boy to school.- She says I must commence right off to go to school and&#xD;
prepare for college by next year. My candle is most burnt down, so&#xD;
good night-love to Gilly and Walter-kiss Maud.&#xD;

from the shops of the above-mentioned tailors and shoe-&#xD;
makers; and as seamstresses and shoe-bi ders never&#xD;
since the world began were known to finish their work&#xD;
before night, it fell out that my journeyings to the shops&#xD;
of our patrons commonly took place at night.&#xD;
Now, by chance, there was on'the street along which&#xD;
travelled, a vacant house-a dreary, clapboard-rat-&#xD;
tling, shutter-flapping, haunted house, which nightly&#xD;
gave forth sounds, not unmusical, but unearthly. Oppo-&#xD;
site the corner of this building there stood a white post,,&#xD;
marking a boundary of the lots, and rejoicing near the&#xD;
top in the two letters, O. Q., the initials of the owner&#xD;
of the property.' It is needless to hint to the imagina-&#xD;
tive reader, that those black letters shone forth from the&#xD;
white post like two spectral eyes-dim, hollow, far.-&#xD;
The supernatural 'sounds issuing from the haunted&#xD;
house, together with the appearance of the v hite figure&#xD;
-.demon-eyed--sometimes, in fact frequently,' con-&#xD;
strained Walter March to quicken his footsteps as he&#xD;
approached the fearful neighborhood, or to take the&#xD;
middle or opposite side of the street-to whistle with&#xD;
apparent unconcern-to -start with affright t the least&#xD;
unusual object, man or beast, suddenly coming in sight&#xD;
and in short, to' clear the infernal region at .a goodly&#xD;
run.&#xD;
It is equally needless to go into Iess important 'pasti.-&#xD;
eulirs, such as the tenor of Walter March's dreams-&#xD;
the nightmares that were bestrode by a familiar post--&#xD;

ad lent wings to the speed with which  bounded out&#xD;
after my brother.&#xD;
"What is the matter ?" he asked, astonished at the'&#xD;
sudden quickness of my movements.&#xD;
"Did you not hear it ?" I asked, breathlessly.'&#xD;
".Hear what ?"&#xD;
".That noise ! those sounds ! that piteous complaint&#xD;
in music !"&#xD;
"My dear brother, I fear you are losing your senses ;&#xD;
you will soon be demented. I will go up again and&#xD;
listen, just to convince you."&#xD;
He climbed to the window, and sat on the sill, listen-&#xD;
ing attentively. Of course he heard nothing, or, at&#xD;
.least nothing unusual, and" soon jumped down again.&#xD;
He walked away from the place in silence; but there.&#xD;
was an expression, half-sneering and half-pitying, on his&#xD;
countenance, which cut me to the quick.&#xD;
I now vowed to myself that I would solve, the diffi-&#xD;
culty in the most direct manner. I would go to the&#xD;
spot by night, alone, for nobody should laugh at me&#xD;
more. How whist was I all that day! how preoccupied&#xD;
wigly anticipated conflicts with goblins, witches, dwarfs,&#xD;
dragons-what not!.&#xD;
At the accustomed hour of my errands to the shop at&#xD;

I now resolved to encounter the monster, since there&#xD;
was no monster, or if one, as my mother said with one&#xD;
of her humorous smiles, "he must be fettered, and can&#xD;
do you no harm." The night was cloudy moonlight--.&#xD;
"Such as spectres love," whispered Fear; "So much&#xD;
the better," whispered Courage.&#xD;
The white post appeared and disappeared almost&#xD;
momentarily. I came to within a rood and listened:&#xD;
no sound whatever. I moved forward a step or two,&#xD;
and heard the dismal clank. My heart began at once'&#xD;
to throb. The moon, too, conspired' against me. She&#xD;
fared out of a cloud with sudden brilliancy, and in her&#xD;
light the post gleamed whitely, and the two eyes-&#xD;
impossible to mistake two eys-,glared upon  e. I&#xD;
remembered, though indistinctly, my mother's words.&#xD;
No ghosts, no ghosts, I' hispered to myself. Eut as I&#xD;
advanced, the chain was again heard, with a quick,'&#xD;
loud rattle, over the boards which composed tie side-&#xD;
walk, and the post became converted into al s eleton&#xD;

of vast satisfaction at the sport this adventure seemed&#xD;

Guilford March was K tormented by delusions of&#xD;

Owing this steady ess of character and deliberation&#xD;
of manner, my brother was patronized by lads older,&#xD;
and necessarily wiser, than he.&#xD;
"Do you chop wood, Guilford? asked one of his&#xD;
young gentleme acquaintances.&#xD;
"Of course I do."&#xD;
"c What fr V"&#xD;
" Why my moter works for a living, and I need not&#xD;

Whereupon, in the succeeding verses, the mother grants&#xD;

he loved and praises.&#xD;
But 'independent of Dick' dog and his Blue-eyed&#xD;
Stranger, there was an additional interest excited by&#xD;
Dick in' the hearts of small boys at that time. The&#xD;
Morgan excitement was running high, and Dick the&#xD;
sheriff, on catching an urchin, always inquired-&#xD;
Mason or Anti-mason ?"&#xD;
and let the prisoner go free, or toted him off to the jail,&#xD;
according to his reply. We youngsters long thought&#xD;
Dick must be initiated in all the dreadful mysteries of&#xD;
the secret order. And to this day, I remove my hat&#xD;
reverently whenever I meet a man known to be a&#xD;
Mason (or even Know Nothing), forDick's sake. That&#xD;
lloth Abe and Dick were Shoepacs I never had the&#xD;
least doubt, and I respect them accordingly.&#xD;
A distinguished occasion once served to test the al il-&#xD;
ity and courage of our champions. After .having man-&#xD;
aged the schoolmasters since the beginning of time, as&#xD;
proved by all accounts, both traditional and historical,&#xD;
the boys of our quaint little antique city had imposed&#xD;
upon them, at the hands 'of Archibald Magroy, L.D.&#xD;
and other trustees, aY master who dared to assume the&#xD;
reins- of government h itself. During the golden age&#xD;
when Allen and John were little lads, the numbers of&#xD;
ferules and birchen rods destroyed must have been&#xD;
great. An 'occasion41 p'uiishmernt by violence was-&#xD;
tolerated, but every abuse of the 'penal power was&#xD;

resented, either secretly or openly, b the good ellows&#xD;
of the school; and schoolmasters were taught, by  hole-&#xD;
some experience, what those limits were, beyond which&#xD;
they passed at their peril.,&#xD;
The present worshipful chancello  of the ro, Mr.&#xD;
Merciful Thrasher, chose, presumingly, to ma   the&#xD;
jurisdiction of his own court of quit ; and such an in-&#xD;
fraction of popular sovereignty was not to be tolerated.&#xD;
Xl[r, Thrasher wad a gentleman of medium .height slen-&#xD;
der figure, a 'decided' expression and manner, and much&#xD;
pride of character. His first step was to take th  bull&#xD;
by the horns, and thrash the largest youths. His bold-&#xD;
ness overawed the little' Atheis, and they forthwith&#xD;
began to conspire together to :undermine his throne ;&#xD;
but by virtue of his spies, he outwitted them here" As&#xD;
a measure of last resort, the aid of Abe and Dick their&#xD;
allies, was demanded.&#xD;
An innocent little fight between two lads-lullies&#xD;
among their fellows-had been arranged and went off&#xD;
nicely. The principals, accessories-before and after-&#xD;
witnesses-in short all parties to this case, were br ought&#xD;
to light, and on the following day were to be brought to&#xD;
punishment. Now the time-honored right to pu   boy&#xD;
against boy and raise a fight at a moment's notic had,&#xD;
to say the least, been winked at by all persons in  utho-&#xD;
rity-and here the oppressed parties determined to make&#xD;
a stand for their ancient privileges.&#xD;
A meeting was held by night in the school yard&#xD;
The case is stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SCHOOLMASTER OUT WE-ST.            99&#xD;
"Well," said A e, "what is he going to do ?"&#xD;
"J shouldn't wo ider," replied one, ".if he flogged us&#xD;
to-morrow from a o izzard."&#xD;
" With what ?"&#xD;
"He sent out this afternoon to the bush, and had a&#xD;
dozen birch sticks out and brought in.&#xD;
'e I'm of the opinion," quoth Dick, "that you'd better&#xD;
al cut stick your elves-that is, come up missing to-&#xD;
m rrow morning."&#xD;
"That will only defer the matter till another day.&#xD;
All Merciful takes his 'time. I never knew him to whip&#xD;
a chapon the spur of the moment. He's as cool as a&#xD;
cucumber."&#xD;
" Then," said Diek, "suppose you all quit sch ol1?"&#xD;
"Folks at home won't stand that."           /&#xD;
" Then I gives it up."&#xD;
Abe, however, as not of Dick's despairing humor.&#xD;
"Where are those. rods ?" he asked.&#xD;
"In the desk."&#xD;
" Can you unlock it ?"&#xD;
"No, we've tried all the keys in he town I believe,&#xD;
every one of us brought all we could from home."&#xD;
"Is the school-house door locked "&#xD;
"Yes."&#xD;
" Are the' windows fastened ?"&#xD;
"No."&#xD;
" Abe,' andDick, and several of the larger boys now&#xD;
drew off a on~ side for consultation. On their return&#xD;
they announced nting to be done that night, and the&#xD;

100       SHOEPAC RECOLLECTIONS.&#xD;
little fellows were told they might as well go home-&#xD;
which the most of us, myself among the number,&#xD;
innocently did. It came to light afterwards that there&#xD;
was a lurking suspicion in the breast of one o our&#xD;
urchins, who ran straight to Mr. Thrasher's lodgings,'and&#xD;
made know to the master everything that had been so&#xD;
far said or done.&#xD;
Shortly afterwards Abe and Dick, who had pretended&#xD;
to go home, returned to the school-yard in company.&#xD;
wit the boys, and proceeded to fulfill their intention.&#xD;
The rods must be destroyed that night by some  eans&#xD;
or other. At last it was thought best, for fear of etec-&#xD;
tion, that the two champions only should have a h nd in&#xD;
it, for there was as great a desire to outwit their  aster&#xD;
as to escape the threatened flogging.&#xD;
Accordingly the two worthies advanced to a window&#xD;
and railed it. Abe climbed in. Dick remained outside&#xD;
standing guard. The first thing heard from Abe  as an&#xD;
exclamation of pain as his leg came in sharp c intact&#xD;
with a bench.&#xD;
Dick laughed, "Hope it wasn't you shin, old boy, he !&#xD;
he!" .&#xD;
Abe was next heard to utter something aboutu the&#xD;
darkness of the room, and all was again silent.'&#xD;
"Can't you find the desk ?" whispered Dick.&#xD;
"No! I don't believe there ever was one here."&#xD;
"Be quick !" said Dick ; "I hear a step.&#xD;
" Quick ! quick ! golly, somebody's coming-Massa&#xD;

THE SOHjOLMASTER OUT WEST.&#xD;
&#xD;
This' enraged the honest Abraham, and twinin4 one&#xD;
of his long arms around the schoolmaster, he grasped&#xD;
the slender nan as if in a vice, and lifting him fro: the&#xD;
ground, attempted to overthrow him by an effort of&#xD;
main strength. But it seemed that Merciful was no poor&#xD;
wrestler, and his agility put him on a level with Abe,&#xD;
and a regular wrestling match ensued. Dick would&#xD;
fain have aided his friend, but the latter ordered him off.&#xD;
"Keep off, Dick, just see fair play !"&#xD;
By this time a few of the boys had gathered around&#xD;
the wrestlers. Great was their mingled awe, astonish-&#xD;
ment, joy, and semi-regret, to behold the only master&#xD;
they had ever feared. or respected wrestling on the grass&#xD;
with Abe the ostler. At last Abe got his adversary&#xD;
under, so as to hold him.&#xD;
"Promise to do-nothing about it, Mr. Thrasher," laid&#xD;
the boys' champion.&#xD;
"Never !" gasped forth the schoolmaster from between&#xD;
his teeth.&#xD;
Two of the boys came forward and interceded for their&#xD;
vanquished enemy.   But Abe vowed he would .hold&#xD;
him down until morning, unless he promised: what was&#xD;
required. Attempting at this moment to change his&#xD;
hold, his adversary seized the instant, and nearly suc-&#xD;
ceeded in turning Abe. The latter now called for Dick,&#xD;
and by means of a combined effort they dragged the&#xD;
discomflted- knight of the lirch to the door of the base-&#xD;
ment story of the schoolhouse-their jail--and were&#xD;
&#xD;
about to make hi prisoner,_ long enough, at least,:&#xD;
them to secure their own escape,, when Mr. Thrasl&#xD;
rendered the prom ise.&#xD;
"Neither to say anything aboit this night, nor puni&#xD;
any of the boys to-morrow ?"&#xD;
"Neither !"&#xD;
"Never flog any of then again?"&#xD;
"Never !"&#xD;
"Keep your word like a man $"&#xD;
,     c"Yes!"&#xD;
Abe and Dick let go,&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said Merciful Thrasher, to those of h&#xD;
scholars who were standing near, "I have taught school&#xD;
in many places. This is my first defeat. I shall take&#xD;
steamboat to-morrow morning for the West."&#xD;
The boys handed him his cap in silence. He drew&#xD;
over his brows, and strode homewards-the boys mab&#xD;
ing way for him respectfully.&#xD;
.Before .he reached his quarters, however, he wa&#xD;
bvertaken by a committee of the lads, who attempted t&#xD;
apologize through their spokesman.&#xD;
"No sir ! no.sir ! No apologies."&#xD;
They offered; in the nam  of the school, to make any&#xD;
amends in their power..&#xD;
"No sir. You were obli ed to call in foreign aid. I&#xD;
will not trust any of you again. No atonement p ssi-&#xD;
ble--no atonement."&#xD;
His feelings, however, were touched by their kind-&#xD;

yet-proudly, requesting them to prevent the lads of the&#xD;
school from going to the boat the next morning to see&#xD;
him off. This was readily promised.&#xD;
On the following morning the school met as usual.&#xD;
Nothing was said of the incidents of the previous night&#xD;
until the hour of the steamer's departure had gone by.&#xD;
When the fact of the vacancy of the throne was&#xD;
announced, three cheers were given for the dethroned&#xD;
monarch, three times three for Abe and Dick. The&#xD;
boys dispersed for their homes with the news, too good,&#xD;
almost, to be true,-" No school! no school !"&#xD;
The question of school discipline now became one of&#xD;
grave importance with the city patriarchs and squires.&#xD;
The interregnum lasted many months, no one being&#xD;
forthcoming of sufficient' self-confidence to assume the&#xD;
pedagogireins.&#xD;
After great pains, and extensive inquiries over the&#xD;
Eastern States, the place of Merciful Thrasher was&#xD;
filled.&#xD;
The name of this hardy adventurer was 9liphant, and&#xD;
he was, an M.D. The boys called him   r, Oily Fat.&#xD;
Boys are ingenious at nicknames; they frequently ex-&#xD;
press contraries. So it was in this case, for Oily Fat&#xD;
was as lean as Cassius, and never had krown the luxury&#xD;
of fat in his life. But he was an athletic, sinewy man,&#xD;
and combined knowledge with power bEyond precedent&#xD;
or rivalry.&#xD;
What his true history was, no one ever knew; for he&#xD;
told such extraordinary things of himself, that no' one&#xD;
&#xD;

but the youngest pretended to believe anything he s ii&#xD;
-at least concerning~ himself. And yet jit. might b&#xD;
true, for he appearedd equal 'to any emer ency. Th&#xD;
doctor was a remarkable man every way. INis look wa&#xD;
ludicrously frightful; he had straight standing blal&#xD;
hair, black, eyes that "never fell before mortal o&#xD;
immortal," so Oily Fat often declared emphatically&#xD;
and immense whiskers. Those whiskers! I never sha1&#xD;
forget them. One was black, the other a- fiery red&#xD;
This is no-fiction. Did he not dye the red one eve y&#xD;
month or two, and did he not, while the. process o&#xD;
coloring was going on, wear a white kerchief around 1i&#xD;
face, and say he had the tooth-ache,. when any little&#xD;
innocent kindly inquired of "the doctor what, was the&#xD;
matter?$&#xD;
Doctor Oliphant's -appearance went a long way&#xD;
his favor from the threshold. Then his course of pr-&#xD;
ceedings was no less inspiring. God forgive him 'the&#xD;
false words he spake, though doubtless for our good,&#xD;
and in order to obtain that inuence necessary ovar&#xD;
young minds, and the use of tlat ferule necessary o&#xD;
young shoulders.&#xD;
He had taught school in no .less than fifteen Staten.&#xD;
This was not the first occasion he had been summonedI&#xD;
to break in refractory schools. He had been sent for&#xD;
frequ ntly from one end of the Union to the other for&#xD;
precis ly this purpose. He never had any trouble but&#xD;
twice. In Georgia, he was obliged to knock down ever&#xD;

handcuffs and fetters.  And in Tennesse he did not&#xD;
succeed in curbing the spirit of insubordination until he&#xD;
introduced coffins, add laid pistols on the .t ble, coolly&#xD;
remarking, that the frst mutineer should fil one of&#xD;
those coffins..&#xD;
His pathway to our-1hearts was no less hold and admi-&#xD;
rable, though not so horribly picturesque. He' permit&#xD;
ted little manifestations of insubordination on the part&#xD;
of small boys to pass. The first victim was the largest&#xD;
boy in school, and son of the greatest man in the city,&#xD;
no less a dignitary than our newly-arrided Governor.&#xD;
Thisyouth was a w    good fellow, the ringleader in all&#xD;
mischief. On this occasion he declared the master&#xD;
should not thrash a-certain one of the little fellows, as&#xD;
the doctor was proceeding to administer one or two&#xD;
light blows of his fertile on the hand of a winning;&#xD;
whimpering urchin.&#xD;
I shall not attempt to describe the scene which was&#xD;
enacted before our eyes.  Suffice to say, the doctor&#xD;
conqueredy and flogged'the rebel intermeddler soundly.&#xD;
lie ' eemad never to have done. He ordered h~m to&#xD;
stand on the benches, on the desks, on the very stove,&#xD;
and at each hesitation on the part of the victim, he&#xD;
administered a "dose," as we always called his thwacks.&#xD;
That bold punishment put an end to school-boy reign&#xD;
in 'our city. Many fine points there w re, too, about&#xD;
our terrible master.  His absolute sway was never&#xD;
abused bit in the one instance recorded.- A poor boy,&#xD;
or one ofytenderyears, he scarcely punished. He was&#xD;
&#xD;
THE SCHOOLMASTER OUT WEST. - 1()&#xD;
an eloquent lecturer, and introduced an entire change&#xD;
in studying, for although it had traditinally been voted&#xD;
a bore to study-now it became a pleasure. He lec-&#xD;
tured enthusiasticlly on arithmetic, the driest of sub-&#xD;
jects, and performed beautiful experiments in chemistry&#xD;
.-then a new science among us. So great was the inte-&#xD;
rest in this study, that many scapegraces sat up all the&#xD;
night, voluntarily, and laboriously burnished plates of&#xD;
the now old-fashioned galvanic battery; with which he&#xD;
performed such wonders!&#xD;
Yes,; I believe, after all, that our good friend, 'Dr.&#xD;
Oliphant was a gentleman and a scholar ; And if God&#xD;
forgave,, or he himself believed, the ingenious fictions&#xD;
which he palmed off upon 'our credulous young minds,&#xD;
I have no doubt he died as a' Christian. God may&#xD;
forgive a falsehood told .a child, but the child never&#xD;
does. No matter what apparent necessity, or how good&#xD;
soever the motive, when you come to detect the deceit,&#xD;
and see that those who had the care. of you, imposed&#xD;
upon you, trifled with your understanding, cheated,&#xD;
deluded you, it lessens your confidence in the integit&#xD;
of man, and violates the majesty of truth eternal in your&#xD;
breast.&#xD;

Here the low voice broke down completely.&#xD;

The hat was removed.&#xD;

There were three little Jumpses, though one, the&#xD;
eldest; was a pretty long leap, a, tall stem of a youth,&#xD;
that looked as if he had sprouted forth in a night. This&#xD;
was Joram. Jumps. He was about fourteen years of&#xD;
age. Then came a boy of twelve, and a flaxen-haired&#xD;
limp of a girl of ten. The children seemed to regard&#xD;
Guilford with the wonder of their mother, added to a&#xD;
little awe. of their own, and they moved about like&#xD;
mutes, treating their city guest with an occasional stare.&#xD;
The interior of our beautiful :'peninsula was but&#xD;
thinly settled, and the country aroundFarner Jumps's&#xD;
was almost a wilderness. His house was a mere cabin&#xD;
of logs, chinked with a clayey mud, composed of one&#xD;
story, and. that contained but the common room in&#xD;
which the family ate, sat, slept, shook with fever and&#xD;
ague, and held periodical prayer. meetings for the pio-&#xD;
neers of the neighborhood.&#xD;
Some short cakes were baking in a spider over the&#xD;
coals as Guilfogd entered. An iron tea-kettle was sing-&#xD;
ing a cheerful welcome and waving its little fleecy&#xD;
banners of steam, and by the time Jumps had turned&#xD;
off the cattle and re-entered, the cabin, was filled with&#xD;
the rich odor of frying pork and potatoes, and Dame&#xD;
Jumps, assisted by her daughter,. whose name was&#xD;
Susannah, was setting the table for supper.&#xD;
The crockery-ware, said Guilford, consisted of the&#xD;
odds and ends of many different old sets, of as many&#xD;

different colors, originally brown, bl&#xD;
yellow was not wanting.' These relics&#xD;
ostentatiously set up, each piece separa&#xD;
on the shelves of a red cupboard. It&#xD;
everything in the house, except her&#xD;
Jumps valued her "cheena," as she&#xD;
rubbish, of broken wares ; and it is .a&#xD;
people always bother themselves and*&#xD;
lives on what they foolishly fancy giv&#xD;
happiness. So it was with 'the dame,&#xD;

Before the table was set, Suz had qu&#xD;

sympathy was still further excited whe&#xD;

ford managed so as to give the little po&#xD;

and she had helped her mother to clear&#xD;
and received the same amount of abuse&#xD;
on account of the cheena, she got the&#xD;

&#xD;
gance. It may be needless to say what everybody&#xD;
knows-that all town boys are regarded by their coun-&#xD;
try cousins as a sort of superior race. This inly acknow-&#xD;
ledged superiority,' however, the country lads are ever&#xD;
ready to dispute.  To Guilford's knowledge, on the&#xD;
occasion before us, these, farmer lads were soon ready to&#xD;
defer, for the purpose of more fully extracting informa-&#xD;
tion on sundry matters in which they stood in igno-&#xD;
rance.&#xD;
Accordingly Guilford interested them  deeply in his&#xD;
accounts of caravans, circuses, militia-trainings, fire&#xD;
engines, skates, schools, kites, tops;,jewsharps, and mar-&#xD;
bles.  They were disappointed, however, to find he&#xD;
knew so little about ginger-bread, a goodly array of&#xD;
which, in bird-like, beast-like, man-like, and woman-&#xD;
like forms, they had once seen in a shop window. There&#xD;
had been a lurking disposition at first, on the part of&#xD;
the young Jumpses, to humble my brother next day-&#xD;
so Susannah afterwards revealed;-but his frankness,&#xD;
and the satisfactory information he' gave, on the whole,&#xD;
changed their intentions; and far from desiring now to&#xD;
expose his ignorance of the various secrets of wood-&#xD;
craft, they resolved to aid him all in their power to learn&#xD;
farming. As for Suz, she was perfectly charmed, as&#xD;
she told me long afterwards,, with his gentleness and&#xD;
superior understanding. To her, Guilford was of a new&#xD;
order of being, and at once she began to "slick up,"' as&#xD;
she said.&#xD;
Then bed-time came. Guilford had observed but one&#xD;

bed, and wondered whether Jumps und 'his wife and&#xD;
family and he were all to sleep in it. But Mrs. Jumps&#xD;
soon solved that problem, by drawing from beneath the&#xD;
bedstead a truckle bed large enough to 'hold the three&#xD;
boys ; and a couchi was* made for Susannah on a long&#xD;
blue chest-which, by the way, had probably held their&#xD;
worldly 'goods and chattels when they emigrated from&#xD;
Vermont.&#xD;
Mr. Jumps being the last to retire, lew out the light,&#xD;
that is to say, covered up the fire, lea ing the hearth in&#xD;
sole possession of a speckled cat, and a pan of buck-&#xD;
wheat batter, placed there to "rise" fo breakfast. But&#xD;
no sooner did silence prevail in the loghouse, than Gu-&#xD;
ford heard a long 'dismal howl, that arose from the&#xD;
woods in the midst of which they lay. Soon came&#xD;
another, longer, and mingled with fellow-howls, each&#xD;
one seeming to draw nigher and nigh i to the door, till&#xD;
at length it seemed to be besieged with a roar of dismal&#xD;
howlings-.&#xD;
Guilford drew the coverlid over~ is head ; but his&#xD;
bed-fellows only laughed at his fears. Ashamed of&#xD;
betraying himself in such wise to these country bump-&#xD;
kins, he uncovered his head.. A perf et blast of roars&#xD;
and threats, mingled with whines and screeches of dis-&#xD;
appointed yet greedy rage saluted his ears.&#xD;
" What is it ?"' demanded he ini a whisper.&#xD;

When dinner-time came, Dame Jumps. appeared in&#xD;
the angel avocation of blowing a trumpet-that is to&#xD;
say sounding a long tin horn. She showed herself at&#xD;
the corner of the cabin, and with the instrument applied&#xD;
to her mouth with one hand, while the other arm she&#xD;
held akimbo at her side to assist in the mighty effort,&#xD;
she brayed forth a Jericho-shaking blast. .There was no&#xD;
resisting this call, it said in Mrs. Jumps's most decided&#xD;
manner:&#xD;
"Dinner's ready, and waits for no man."&#xD;
Guilford was hungry and ate heartily. He deserved&#xD;
some reward for his plight. His hands were scratched,&#xD;
his face blackened, and his eyes filled up with cinders.&#xD;
Suz expressed her sympathy by bringing a tin wash-basin,&#xD;
and water-none of the cleanest-from a spring near by&#xD;
the house, distilling through the black vegetable mould&#xD;
into a barrel which was half alive with insects, while&#xD;
occasionally, a lingering frog who had chine up to sun&#xD;
his body out of the torpor of an October day, plumped&#xD;
himself down with a splash as you approached.&#xD;
After dinner the party betook themselves to the clear-&#xD;
ing again, where they worked away till near nightfall,&#xD;
when Toby and Guilford were again dis atched for the&#xD;
cows ; no trifling errand, as the animals wandered far&#xD;
during the day--=water in the woods being pletyand&#xD;

farmer of himself, just as -easy as rollin off a log, but it&#xD;
ain't so tarnal easy. A man ought to have a turn for it,&#xD;
with a constitution like a horse. He mast work like a&#xD;
dog, and be weather-wise as the Propht Elijah. And&#xD;
that ain't all nuther-he must adopt a conrse."&#xD;
" Yes sir," said Guilford-who knew  lready that "to&#xD;
adopt a course," was the Jumps philosophy-his panacea&#xD;
for every ill. Jumps rarely condescends to explain&#xD;
himself after uttering this indiputable dogma. And so&#xD;
now, ho arose, entered the house to rekindle his pipe,&#xD;
and rea peared with a live coal, which e shifted rapid&#xD;
ly from his right hand to his left, and as swiftly froi4&#xD;
his left hand to his right, vainly endeav ring to plant il&#xD;
in the bowl. The refractory coal dropped on the floor.&#xD;
Jumps took the tongs to it.&#xD;
"Yes!" resumed the smoking philosopher, "a man&#xD;

At this moment Joram broke in.&#xD;
"Dad, don't you think Pd make a s art minister of&#xD;

Mri Jumps, senior, did not reply. He rose up hastily,&#xD;
knocked/the ashes from the bowl of his pipe on the nail&#xD;

to death, and, after all, didn't seem to get on. With&#xD;
reference to the last complaint, we may as well antici-.&#xD;
pate a few year, and state, that notwithstanding this,&#xD;
melancholy list of grievances, the 9umpses continued to&#xD;
exist, nay, to thrive, from year to year, ti11, as we shall&#xD;
see, in due time, they had the best farm in the county,&#xD;
and the Jumpses became one of the "first families."&#xD;
Guilford observed this very satisfactory account,&#xD;
which it gave them such evident delight to draw, and&#xD;
thought that as it is only necessary to see an evil in&#xD;
order to avoid falling into it ourselves, he himself would'&#xD;
do better; therefore, he continued to hol4 on steadily to&#xD;
his course.&#xD;
But Mr. Jumps seemed to take a pecul ar pleasure in&#xD;
making Guilford March work.&#xD;
"You have adopted a course, my lit le fellow," he&#xD;
would say, "and you must stick to it through thick and&#xD;
thin."&#xD;
Accordingly, there was little peace  r rest for the&#xD;
poor boy, until night came. He began t fancy himself&#xD;
growing dull, like Joram and Toby. Th  thought hor-&#xD;
rified him ; yet' all the boys he saw were of the same&#xD;
species. " All work and no play makes Jack a dull&#xD;
boy," sure enough, thought he.&#xD;
There were a hundred people in the vicinity-tw9&#xD;
thirds of them were down with ague or 1ilious fever.&#xD;

But of all things a French wedding was&#xD;
celebrated for downright enjoyment. My eye&#xD;
swimming scenes of mirth as memory recal&#xD;
those joyous occasions. The real fountain of&#xD;
tion was a French wedding. Here old peop&#xD;
and came out' young again. The oldest d&#xD;
dear life, and the gayest -and lightest dancer&#xD;
to be some fat and heavy old gentleman, wit&#xD;
elderly and sizable partner. They bowed and&#xD;
with a grace and a joy, they tip-toed it up a&#xD;
round and about, pirouetted and coquetted, bal&#xD;
swung, cheated and chased, with a vivacity th&#xD;
hoary old Time himself into the set as you&#xD;
happy as the rest of them. Such innocent, h&#xD;
delightful frolics give your bridal couple a fa&#xD;
life, though I have little doubt they might e&#xD;
soft and gentle votaries of.fashion from many&#xD;
tomed nap through a cotillion. But we have r&#xD;

Those were dangerous times for old bachelo&#xD;

Alas! the major was gallantry itself.  ihe h&#xD;

set his blood in motion. His mother had died.  Y,&#xD;

The scholarly old  entleman himsef fished in the&#xD;
mazy streams of the law, in order to test the advnc&#xD;
of his son in those studies. -Of course, Allen was defl&#xD;

smothered until an eventhappened in ayothpr quartet.&#xD;
Sitting 'in kahe doorway of the kennel, wich his nse&#xD;

Allen -was soon seen returning pensively&#xD;
hom e.  A s  he  re-crossed  the  avenue,  and  dre&#xD;
little plum, orchard, a rap was heard on the fi&#xD;
father's office. The angry voice of Mr. Magri&#xD;
"Allen ! come hither, sir !"&#xD;
The door closed upon the two. Mr. Magro&#xD;
'deeply' agitated for many words. Heraised&#xD;

Again the rod rose igh in air. The blow descended.&#xD;
And the boy went for th a man;- even as the boy David&#xD;
was driven from 4hi presence of Saulk-a king! a king!&#xD;
Now it was that Allen took up Blackstone 'with&#xD;
earnest purpose. The prospect-of a wealthy inheritance&#xD;
fell from his shoulders as a camel's load. The desert&#xD;
before him, and he free ! It was necessary, however, to&#xD;
earn his way. He hung out a modest little sign,.with&#xD;

The word, "conscience" pointed Maud Ato the diff-&#xD;
cult, narrow way, the straight road. She went forth&#xD;
from her morning prayers, next day, sadder, yet calmer.&#xD;
Allen Magroy met her as usual on the path to&#xD;
school.&#xD;
The accustomed greetings were exchanged-perhaps,&#xD;
on the side lof .Maud, with even Mnore' than the accus-&#xD;
tomed warmth. 'There was a sorrowlful ardor in her&#xD;
looks, whenever she turned them  upon   the proud-&#xD;
bearing young gallant at her side. Even suffering had&#xD;
not deprived Allen of his dashing ease of manner ; and&#xD;
fine address is not lost on woman --'tis -no little of the&#xD;
divinity she attributes to her hero.  Allen wore his&#xD;
hair long, as was the manner of the day; hisblack&#xD;
locks were worthy a knight of romance'; he had, more-&#xD;
over, made a vow-silly fellow !-on le ving the pater-&#xD;
nal mansion, with the world before him; not to shear&#xD;
his hair until his father, proud of his success, should&#xD;
forgive him. That was a rash, boyish vow; and in the&#xD;
clearer light of a letter reason, his long hair hung&#xD;
around him, a real covering of humility. As the two&#xD;
walked over the green grass now, a stranger might&#xD;
point to them and exclaim-&#xD;
" There go t le pride and beauty of the village ?"&#xD;
Strangers would call our little city a village.&#xD;
(Yet Maud, inher untrained ringlets, simple Fre ch&#xD;

Astonished at the blindness and foily of the'juv&#xD;
world, the bread whieh Mr. Magroy had cast upo&#xD;
waters returned to his own heart. His eyes be&#xD;
once more upon his son.&#xD;
Allen had at length entered the office of Atto&#xD;
Floiry, who furnished him sufficient writing fo'&#xD;
necessities, and the student was giving now hi w&#xD;
time and energies to the Law.&#xD;
One day, while his senior was, a court,, Alle&#xD;
leaning over the desk-his, mind lost in the perple&#xD;
and useless, intricacies of the famous, hitty-how h&#xD;
would he have been to 'make the bettor acquaintan(&#xD;
the clear, concise, and common-sense- Stephens !1&#xD;
Startled by a loudarp rap at the door, he tu&#xD;
and beheld his father-with his cane&#xD;
" Allen Magroy !"o&#xD;
" My dear father I?&#xD;
"Are you doing well, sir ?"&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I shall soon be ready fo examination.&#xD;
seated, father."&#xD;
The face of Allen Magroy was su ffsed with ]pea&#xD;
The old man took the proffered ch ir, and plante&#xD;
nano with his two hands before him.&#xD;
"iHave you repeated, sir ?"&#xD;
"Repented of wpa, father?".&#xD;
"Repented ofwhat? you rebellious young r&#xD;

grey hairs in sorrow to the grave,  sir !"&#xD;
Each sentence of this affectionate address was empha-&#xD;
sized by Mr. Magroy's cane-ferule on the floor.&#xD;
For such an outbreak the young man was not pre-&#xD;
pared. A hope had suddenly, violently, been cru hed&#xD;
It was with difficulty he could speak.&#xD;
"Father, I would not reproach you; but what ever&#xD;
can account for this misunderstanding?"&#xD;
"Misunderstanding I" echoed the old gentleman, say&#xD;
agely.&#xD;
"What can account for it ?" continued Allen, "but a&#xD;
want of knowledge an absence of sympathy between&#xD;
your heart and mine ? Could Iabut hope to clear up this&#xD;
cloud, could I but dare to unfold my views, my heart,&#xD;
my wishes my whole being, changed, though trampled&#xD;
upon as I have been, I would thank, oh!1 how I woui4&#xD;

Allen's hands wire clasped together ; his look:was&#xD;
agony.&#xD;
"God knows! G d knows," he cried tenderly, "I&#xD;
would not embitter your earthly days."&#xD;
" Then, sir," spoke Mr. Magroy, softly,' you have:&#xD;

"Dear. father," relied Allen  o.see things in so.&#xD;

IT was a night of more than ordinary cheerfulness.&#xD;
The return of Guilford on the previous evening lent an&#xD;
additional brightness to the ruddy glow of the library&#xD;
fire. A knock was heard at the front door. Bowes came&#xD;
in with a letter, which she said, looking away, was for&#xD;
Maud. Allen Magrdy had left it, without any message.&#xD;
Maud blushed and turned quite pale, as Mrs. March&#xD;
handed the letter to her daughter.&#xD;
" Perhaps you would like to read'it alone, my child ?"&#xD;
Maud retired, taking a light.&#xD;
She was not gone a moment, but returned, and handed,&#xD;
the opened letter to her mother.    It was as follows:&#xD;
"DEAR MAUD,&#xD;
"You must, you will pardon me for writing, when you learn&#xD;
what. I have to communica te. My father visited me this afternoon. I&#xD;
will not particularize what took place ; but in going away he used&#xD;
threatening language con erning your mother's family. He never&#xD;
threatens in vain. ,But I d n't know what it can be. My heart is wrung&#xD;
&#xD;
m so completely in the dark and powerless t&#xD;
tell your mother to be on her guard.&#xD;
"ALLEN MAGRoY."&#xD;
&#xD;
This epistle of course threw us into some consterna&#xD;
tion.  Mrs. Marc   alone maintained hli; tcalmness&#xD;
Mabel declared that Mr. Magroy meant to burn the&#xD;
house down, and  oud were her lamentations that :he&#xD;
father was not at home. to rescue us from. destruction&#xD;
M: Latrobe had gone to New York, with the expectation&#xD;
of sailing for Lou on on business for the company, an&#xD;
probably had left re this. Maud was silent, and pale.&#xD;
Guilford said he saw no way in which Mr. Magro&#xD;
could injure us.&#xD;
We are in a f ee country, and the law will protect&#xD;
us, mother."&#xD;
Guilford thought highly of the power and justice of&#xD;
the law, on accour t of the experience he had enjoyed&#xD;
in witnessing a cas in court, already hinted at in John&#xD;
March's letter. -Mrs. March thought some terrible&#xD;
calamity might -be impending over the head of her&#xD;
daughter, the inno ent cause of the unfortunate quarrel&#xD;
between father and son; but she wisely kept her ow&#xD;
counsel. At this onjuncture in our affairs how tear-&#xD;
fully the widow t4 ought of her husband, their natural&#xD;
protector. But w s he not watching, and was there&#xD;
not a yet more powerful friend, even the widow's God?&#xD;
At last Mrs. March spoke.,&#xD;

assured in my own heart that God will provide a way&#xD;
of escape."&#xD;
She took down thle family Bible, and read the 91st&#xD;
Psalm. With what sweet hope and gentle reassurance&#xD;
the family arose after evening worship and retired to&#xD;
their beds!&#xD;
Such is Religion's oothing balm.&#xD;
The period for t e third annual payment on the&#xD;
house was now rapidly, approaching. We had not found&#xD;
our creditor a hard man.. The day had passed by in&#xD;
both previous years without the money being demanded,&#xD;
and Mrs. March had been allowed to take her own time.&#xD;
This year was a difi ult one for householders, provisions&#xD;
were never known o high, and the number of our&#xD;
boarders (our only pecuniary resource) had diminished.&#xD;
Mrs. March expected daily to hear some dread news on&#xD;
account of the warning Allen had given. But it seemed&#xD;
as if either the youth was mistaken, or that his father&#xD;
had changed his humor, for weeks passed without&#xD;
calamity, and the fear of it at first so appalling, gradu-&#xD;
ally died away. Meantinewe were all making strenu-&#xD;
ous efforts to increase the list of our boarders, to reduce&#xD;
still more our slender expenses, and by careful economy&#xD;
to lay up money for the payment. The event, however,&#xD;
seemed doubtful, The times grew harder, and we were&#xD;
drawing on what had already been  sated and laid by.&#xD;
The first day of the last quarter came, and with it&#xD;
another note from Allen:&#xD;
&#xD;
"DvAi MAUD:&#xD;
"Ihave just learned from Mr. Floury that my father has pur-&#xD;
chased the remaining unpaid portion on the bill of sale of your mother's&#xD;
house. What his object may be I dare not conjecture. Pardon me for&#xD;
presuming to advise, that if Mrs. March only meets the payments&#xD;
promptly, as they fall' duethere can be no trouble. Hoping I am not&#xD;
destined to be the herald of further exciting news, I remain&#xD;
"1ALI4EN MAGROY.".&#xD;
This was 'frightful enough, yet Mrs. March, while not&#xD;
de pairing of making the next payment. in time, felt&#xD;
so e relief in the fact that-Mr. Magroy seemed to direct&#xD;
his-malice against her rather 'than Maud.&#xD;
" After all," she said, "'it may be a mere matter of,&#xD;
business between Mr. Articles and Mr. Magroy."      The&#xD;
former was the gentleman in whose hands the property&#xD;
had fallen at my father's decease, and from whom Mrs.&#xD;
March had made the purchase.&#xD;
Every sinew was now strained to meet the app -oach-&#xD;
ing liability.  With no little reluctance on the part of&#xD;
Mrs. March, Maud, Guilford, and myself were with-&#xD;
drawn from our schools to save the expense of tuition.&#xD;
Mabel declared she would not go either, but insisted&#xD;
'on reciting, to Maud, and turning her school expenses&#xD;
into the family fund.  It was to no purposethat we all&#xD;
protested. Mabel would have her way. And Maud&#xD;
became our instructress for the nonce.&#xD;
Payment day came. It seemed to my imaginative&#xD;
soul that we were on the eve of some grand catastrophe,&#xD;
that the world was to be in some sudden manner&#xD;

chang d, to us at least, for I knew very well that the&#xD;
filthy lucre was not forthcoming., And to think of'&#xD;
Mr. Magroy! I 'epresented him to Mabel as a bloody-&#xD;
minded Shylock.' After breakfast my mother went&#xD;
down the avenue. She did not return till the dinner&#xD;
hour.- It was easy to see ,that she was disappointed.&#xD;
Her excellent old friend Casher Coiner could have&#xD;
helped her to ten times the amount at any other time,&#xD;
but now the- year was just closing, and the bank&#xD;
directors had given orders that not a dollar should be&#xD;
discounted until they saw how the affairs of the institu-&#xD;
tion stood, and whether it would be likely to weather&#xD;
the currency storm just beginning to rage ovei- the&#xD;
country. She had applied to several of her friends&#xD;
among the merchants, but with little better suc-&#xD;
cess.&#xD;
In the afternoon she put on her widows' cap, black&#xD;
bonnet and shawl, and neat plain collar, and again&#xD;
went opt. Soon reaching the house of 4r. Magroy the&#xD;
tremulously raised the brass knocker at the door. Dame&#xD;
Polly Fidgets appeared, dressed in silk.&#xD;
"Isoytr master at home, Mrs. Fidgets ?"&#xD;
"Pd like to know who you call my master, mam.&#xD;
I'm as dgod'as'any wash"&#xD;
"I beg your pardon.- Is Mr. Magroy at home ?"&#xD;
"Well, I'llsee," said the ruffled hen partridge, smooth-&#xD;
ing her feathers-with an ill grace.&#xD;
Mrs. March was left standing on the door-sill, whil&#xD;
the dame was gone. Her heart palpitated violently,&#xD;
&#xD;
CLOUDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
158"3&#xD;
&#xD;
and in spite of herself already augured an unfavorable&#xD;
termination to her. mission.&#xD;
"This way, ma'am. Mr. Magroy will see you in his&#xD;
office."&#xD;
"Have you come On business, ma'am p" My mother&#xD;
made no reply.&#xD;
Worthy Dame Fidgets did, not leave the door which&#xD;
opened from the house into the office, but anxious for&#xD;
her prospects, and fearful that a reconciliation might be&#xD;
effected between her master and the Marches, and&#xD;
thereby lead to the return of the disinherited son, she&#xD;
applied her ear to the keyhole.&#xD;
"You wish to see me, madam," growled the deep&#xD;
voice of the entlemanly proprietor of the mansion, who,&#xD;
from some u known cause did not raise his face towards&#xD;
the lady.,&#xD;
"Yes, sir," said my mother, summoning all the com-&#xD;
posure she could command.&#xD;
"There is a chair," spoke again the voice.&#xD;
Mrs. March sat down, or rather sank down, in silence,&#xD;
which she at length interrupted with difficulty.&#xD;
"Mr. Magroy, there has begin some trouble between&#xD;
yourself and Allen, in which, by some.,  itentional&#xD;
circumstance or act perhaps of"-   Mr.  fagioy sud--&#xD;
-denly sat erect..&#xD;
" Is this your business, madam ?"&#xD;
Such rudeness in his speech ! his looks! his whole&#xD;
manner, aroused all, the pride of character of Mrs.&#xD;
March.&#xD;

"No, sir !" said she rising with dignity and coloring&#xD;
highly. "It was my desire to remove any misunder-&#xD;
standing that might exist between us as neighbors.&#xD;
But since you have so rudely repulsed me at the&#xD;
threshold I will bid that intention go, as best it may,&#xD;
conscious, sir, of the innocence of'me and of mine."&#xD;
"Oh yes, Mrs. March, neither you nor your fair&#xD;
daughter are capable of womanly designs on young&#xD;
gentlemen ,above yourselves in the world. Women&#xD;
never are 1",&#xD;
I' No gentleman-no one but a coward, sir ! would&#xD;
thus insult a defenceless woman."&#xD;
"Do you come to beard me, woman?" he yelled forth&#xD;
with such frenzy as to shake the door at which Mrs.&#xD;
Fidget's ear.waspinned, so as to shale that honest&#xD;
woman from head.to foot-but with delight at the&#xD;
cheering course of events,&#xD;
A retort rose to the tongue of my mother, but she&#xD;
remembered the cry of the little ravens in the home&#xD;
nest, and she shrank back likewise from the vulgar war&#xD;
of words, so suddenly and unexpectedly raised. She&#xD;
had   pected no such reception, and with bitterness she&#xD;
remembered that this same insolent man had been&#xD;
under no small obligation to her husband in their early&#xD;
business life. - Nay, more, she might h ve recalled the&#xD;
time, further back, when the young Scot conferred&#xD;
upon her the honor of his :marked attentions. All this&#xD;
flashed through her oppressed and out aged soul, and&#xD;
left an almost lightning scathe. ,Then s e remembered~&#xD;
&#xD;
OLPUDS -,&#xD;
&#xD;
the words of the Psalmist, "I will rebuke kings for thy&#xD;
sake," and quietly resolved to leave the widow's cause&#xD;
with the widow's God.&#xD;
She advanced to the table at which Mr. Magroy was&#xD;
sitting, and laid upon it a package of money.&#xD;
"Payment on the house, hem! Let me see," said he,&#xD;
"how much is due;" The dissen bler! had he not been&#xD;
feasting his eye on the little note ;all day.&#xD;
Three hundred dollars !"&#xD;
My mother kept silence as he then proceeded to count&#xD;
the bills.&#xD;
" Here are but two hundred."&#xD;
"Yes sir ! I thought that if convenient to you"-my&#xD;
poor mother paused. To beg any favor of this creature&#xD;
was too humiliating. Then she-endeavored to look upon&#xD;
it as a matter of business and went on, under the scowl&#xD;
of her creditor.&#xD;
"If 'as convenient to you, sir, a few days delay would&#xD;
I think enable me to procure the remaining hundred&#xD;
dollars."&#xD;
"Possibly your expected son-in-law, that penniless&#xD;
scapegrace of mine, might assist you," he said sarcastic-&#xD;
ally.&#xD;
My mother bit her lips till the blood flowed. At&#xD;
length she was able to reply calmly.&#xD;
" Mr. Magroy, you ha e repelled my explanations,&#xD;
you have added iisult to insinuation, you would drive&#xD;
me to madness and to ruin. But know, sir! that there&#xD;

ous insinuation. And now, even though you appear' to&#xD;
triumph, I fear you not. No," she added murmuringly,&#xD;
"I fear not what man can do."&#xD;
Mrs. March's calmness had by this time excited the&#xD;
iiflammable character before her, even s oil the burning&#xD;
tow.&#xD;
"What the devil has got into all of them ?" he cried&#xD;
jumping upon the floor, and stamping  ercely with his&#xD;
foot and striking his cane. "My villainous son and this&#xD;
washerwoman preach to me ! yes, a  oman preach to&#xD;
me! .Is that the way you converted him? caused him&#xD;
to raise his arm against his indulgent father? drove him&#xD;
away from the fire-side of home; filled his head with&#xD;
fine notions of equality and virtue ; a pox on both you&#xD;
and, your preaching ! Please begone from my roof,&#xD;
madam, you contaminate a once happy home with your&#xD;
hypocritical white visage."&#xD;
"When you have endorsed the amount of that pack-&#xD;
age on the note, Mr. Magroy."&#xD;
My mother was remarkably cool and self possessed.&#xD;
A timid bird even will fight for her nest and young..&#xD;
"No such thing, madam ! I'll do no such thing !"&#xD;
said he tossing the money on the table.&#xD;
" Bring the whole amount due, and that in coin, or&#xD;
I'll turn you out of your house, bag and baggage !" .&#xD;
Mrs. March gathered up the package, andawnt out by&#xD;
the. office door. Happily this for Mrs. IFidgets, who was&amp;amp;&#xD;
&#xD;
CLOUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
157&#xD;
&#xD;
so fascinated by the scene, that she was not prepared&#xD;
for my mother's exit by the door at. which she was&#xD;
admitted.&#xD;
Mrs. arch passed through the little orchard fronting&#xD;
the offie, ant turned her steps towards  e business&#xD;
portion of tIe city. .It was past banking  ours, and&#xD;
most of the merchants had either deposited in the banks&#xD;
or locke away their specie for safe keeping; so that it&#xD;
was no easy matter to exchange the bills for the legal&#xD;
tender u on which Mr. Magroy insisted. She succeeded&#xD;
in exchanging a part, however, but as for borrowing the&#xD;
additionI hundred dollars that was entirely out of the&#xD;
question on that day. She remembered that the law&#xD;
allowed her until twelve at night to make the payment,&#xD;
and so went heavily homeward. As she walked down&#xD;
the little lawn in front of the dear old mansion that&#xD;
looked n w like a blessing brightening as,"if on the eve&#xD;
of flight, she was almost thrilled at 'the laud cheery&#xD;
notes of  robin perched on top of a leaflesslilac bush.&#xD;
A momentary gleam of hope seemed to quicken heiy&#xD;
steps at the sound.&#xD;
"That robin wouldn't sing o if the little han Is&#xD;
that fed it were going away: no! the angels would nt&#xD;
let it."&#xD;
So 'hal smilingly half sadly thought the little cares&#xD;

He di not return. After waiting som time we'march-&#xD;
dvery solemnly into the library, where we found him&#xD;
looking soberly yet singularly into the fire before which&#xD;
he was sitting. It was.evident something new had hap-&#xD;

plain front the boy's countenance. Yet as no one&#xD;
thought it could be connected with te -terrible cloud&#xD;

IT was a good custom in our old times, for gentlemen&#xD;

Eloquence. was then a gentlemanly and influential&#xD;

had not yet supplanted it.&#xD;
The society met, in the old Council House.'&#xD;
This venerable building; now no more, deserves a&#xD;
passing word, as it dated back to the most primitive&#xD;
times of the white men on that frontier. Here the&#xD;
chiefs of the tribes gravely smoked Ka-nic-a-nic--or&#xD;
Indian tobacco of the North, prepared from the bark of&#xD;
the red willow-with the governor of the town and the&#xD;
ghostly: Jesuit Fathers. The odor of ka-nic-a-nic still&#xD;
clung to its walls. There seemed yet to be a sort of&#xD;

learning and $irtue in the welfare of a state. The&#xD;
learned and witty Counsellor O'IMar, with his drollery,&#xD;
and mixture of pathos and ridicule, has just sat down&#xD;
beneath the roars and shouts of the meeting.&#xD;
Allen rises, to answer him on thepside of virtue. . You&#xD;
wonder at his temerity. His face is crimsoned with&#xD;
genuine modesty.   He alludes deferentially to the&#xD;
superior judgment and greater experience of his prede-&#xD;
cessor, and pays a compliment to his art and learning.&#xD;
Before proceeding to unfold .his own argument, h&#xD;
attacks the weak points of his adversary; and in less&#xD;

his great, burning eye-balls shone only on Maud. The&#xD;
question is carried Eby acclamation in, favor of virtue.&#xD;
The meeting breaks up, and everybody shakes the hand&#xD;
of Allen Magroy-everybody save one. Yet their eyes&#xD;
have met, and in that one look is Allen's chief laurel.&#xD;
How cruel that destiny seemed, which, like an impas-&#xD;
sable abyss divided those great twin hearts.' There&#xD;
the       like two tall cliffs, asunder, with their sun-&#xD;
lit faces fixed, the one upon the other, in steady con-&#xD;
stancy, sublime to contemplate.&#xD;
Time, the river at their feet, rolled down many a&#xD;
golden sand for others,-yet brought no happiness for&#xD;
them.&#xD;
The scrupulous Maud pursued her conscientious path,&#xD;
and, so far as outward sign might show, was no more to&#xD;
Allen Magroy than other gentle maidens of the city.&#xD;
Thus years flowed wearily away.  The river was&#xD;
widening towards the ocean.&#xD;
Meanwhile' Allen passed the bar, and Mr. Floury&#xD;
took the eloquent young advocate into partnership.&#xD;
Allen mingled with society; he often met Maud; she&#xD;
was generally attended by the devoted Major Fontenoy,&#xD;
who lived only in the light of her smiles.&#xD;

As for nkyseWthe memory of my father is yet green&#xD;
in my heart. My love for him is the little shining river.&#xD;
meandering  through my days, and on its banks are&#xD;
clustered the fair flowers of beauty and the rich fruits&#xD;
of love. -I am not sure that my poetical efforts do not&#xD;
date back as far as this period..&#xD;
It was 'a melancholy happiness to take Mabel with&#xD;
me Sunday afternoons with baskets of flowers, which we&#xD;
braided, and laid all over his grave. Sometimes my&#xD;
mother went with us, and looked on with an ab'stracted&#xD;
air, while we twined garlands, over the sorrel, which&#xD;
like little crosses waved amid the grasses as the gentle&#xD;
south wind swept along. On one occasion a tall elderly&#xD;
man, a stranger, who said he came all the way from&#xD;
Nova Scotia, accompanied my mother to the church-&#xD;
yard' andtfey two knelt down together and wept. He&#xD;
did notnake himself known to us, but only said :&#xD;
"He was my friend, where is his grave?"&#xD;
This person may have been once a fur trader.&#xD;
My wanderings in the woods formed an ever fresh&#xD;
source of pleasing ruminations  iere I led a life all&#xD;
iny own. The noise of the school, the sports of merry&#xD;
companions,;and the pleasures of home, where !y,&#xD;
mother and Mael were-and yet1 hereicare thoug&#xD;
in gentle guie stood in the midst' 6f-us-chool-books,&#xD;
and the little ev-eryday duties . hih fell to my 'share&#xD;

up in my coat. The manager cane and went occasion-&#xD;
ally but he was a repulsive looking man, who acted the&#xD;
parts of cruel tyrants and bad fathers, and my heart&#xD;
always failed me. Finally I summoned sufficient courage&#xD;
to address one of the principal actors-a kind-hearted&#xD;
man-he may be living yet, his name was Marsh.&#xD;
Noticing that-jokes always seemed to please the actors,&#xD;
I asked him waggishly.&#xD;
Are you sure, sir, that your name is Marsh ."&#xD;
The 'gentleman stared, and his companions. laughed.&#xD;
"Well, sir!1" he said at- last, 'suppose it. be, then&#xD;

this virtuous politician gave out significantly-before&#xD;

capricious even for a painter, nay, even for a woman-&#xD;
and had drawn that part of the picture intended for the&#xD;
foreground of this human firm divine, all perspective.&#xD;
Nature and true art always go together ; and Joram's&#xD;
shirt-maker had heightened the view of this perspective&#xD;
by the altitude of the advan ed points of Joram's collar,&#xD;
which was starched stiff witlal, and feld Joram's jaws&#xD;
so straight to the front, at d his neck so immovably&#xD;
erect, that you wondered whether Joram   was not&#xD;
afflicted with one of Job's comforters on the neck.&#xD;
"I have brought you a little garden sarse, Widow&#xD;
March, not knowing how's you mightn't be pestered in&#xD;

Joram, by a stupendous efort, turned his erect person&#xD;

were visible, and caught an indistinct view, I dare say,&#xD;
of the edge) of the greater basket.&#xD;
"You ark very, very good, Mr. Jumps."&#xD;
"Folks always calls him squire to home !" was heard&#xD;
from the far end of the railway tunnel, in a nasal twang.&#xD;
"Keep your peace, Joram'!" sternly ordered his&#xD;

"Wall, as you're justice pace, s'pose I must." These&#xD;
sounds, I must not forget to say, issued from the tunnel;&#xD;

"Never will!" muttered Joram distautly.&#xD;
This conversation took place at the Jumpses, when I&#xD;
was sent there to rusticate after  y love freak with&#xD;
Dulcinea. The family were living quite comfortably in&#xD;
a new house built of hewn logs. The neighborhood was&#xD;
settled more thickly. The O'Gradys had been riven&#xD;
out by the intolerable force of public opinion, the&#xD;
American civilizer ; the school-hous was standing on&#xD;
the road-side at a mile's distance front the Jumps estate,&#xD;
and here prayer meetings were held  eekly, and dhool&#xD;
in the winter time.&#xD;
Little as we may commend the r mutation of rustic&#xD;
schools in that country, and at that di  twilight period,&#xD;
this we may say-the prayer meet ngs were unique.&#xD;
Far be it from us to speak irreverent y, much les with&#xD;
ridicule, of those private assemblages f the good. The&#xD;
rude attempts at religious services on the part of those&#xD;
benighted pioneers, may perchance bear more gl rious&#xD;
testimony at the judgment seat than the more refined&#xD;
and sumptuous worship, vacantly and wth wan ering&#xD;
eyes, conned over in velvet pews, and chanted from the&#xD;
throats of gilded organs, or trilled with  peratic ffect&#xD;
by hired musicians. In the East, goo honest sou s are&#xD;
&#xD;
hired tc mourn for the dead. Why may not we employ&#xD;
proxies to sing for the living? 'Tis doubtless sweeter, in&#xD;
the eats of cherubim and seraphim on high, to hear&#xD;
the well tuned voices of professional sweet singers, than&#xD;
the inlarmonious concourse of rude utterances from a&#xD;
promiscuous congregation of saints 'and sinners.&#xD;
Mew me my good pussy cat. Coo me my soft turtle&#xD;

And since we have descended to the animal creation,&#xD;
it behoves us to speak at once of certain young crows,&#xD;
or gentlemen of the cloth, as they are softly denominat-&#xD;
ed, from a certain Theological Seminary not many&#xD;
leagues distant from that State in our grand confederacy&#xD;
where swine are wont to be fed. In the woods, through&#xD;
which they disseminated their doctrines, and quartered&#xD;
themselves on the simple farmer folk, they were known&#xD;
as perfectionists. The incumbent of the Green Run circuit&#xD;
was the Rev. Mr. Milkwhite. On the occasion of my&#xD;
attending "meeting" in the little log school-house by&#xD;
the road-side, this gentleman, a youthful prophet, sat&#xD;
behind a little pine table, serving the purposes of pulpit&#xD;
and desk, with his eyes of milky blue raised, or rather&#xD;
,voluminously rolled, up to the ceiling. It was after the&#xD;
regular morning service-a special gathering of the&#xD;
Just, making or already made perfect. Here sat on low&#xD;
wooden benches a few of the choice spiritual dames and&#xD;
fathers of the Church Militant, settled in the neighbor-&#xD;
hood of Green Iun. As it did not seem to be expected&#xD;
or desired that sinners would be present, it was with no&#xD;

little difficulty I had prevailed upon Joram and +obias&#xD;
to remain with me. In the brief interval between the&#xD;
two meetings they pointed out the parties assembled,&#xD;
and gave me their names, with a glimpse here and there&#xD;
of their characters. I found they .' to be chiefly tbje ter-&#xD;
magant wives and hen-pecked husbands of the township,&#xD;
with an honest exceptional old grey headed saint-- eady&#xD;
to worship God with sheep or goat.&#xD;
To my own discredit be it acknowledged, that Walter&#xD;
March was there from motives of idle curiosity.&#xD;
"Brother Pipelegs will lead the meeting in prayer,"&#xD;
quoth the Rev. Mr. Milkwhite, lowering his eyes&#xD;
towards the side of the house occupied by the female&#xD;
benches, but raising his mortal incumbrance of a  ody,&#xD;
turning with a heavenly sigh, and kneeling down with&#xD;
much devout emotion-in short, a groan.&#xD;
Brother Pipelegs' prayer was not very edifying. fie&#xD;
had become familiar to the ears of the neighborhood,&#xD;
at Jumps's and elsewhere, for years. But he was fol-&#xD;
lowed by young Milkwhite himself. Oh! what a happy&#xD;
season: those excited hearts leaped foi- joy; their joy-&#xD;
ful groans, their shouts of Hosannah ! Amen! come&#xD;
Quickly! Jordan ! and Canaan.! were heard far through&#xD;
the green old cloistered woods. Yet I, who had not&#xD;
long since passed through some excitement-not such&#xD;
as this, however--in a religious way, God forgive nzy&#xD;
shortcomings-I was- hot completely overcome, but&#xD;
wondered at the manifest discrepancy between natural&#xD;

not in my worldly eyes an exciting young man, but a&#xD;
feeble, rather, I thought. Be that as it might, here was&#xD;
the emotion of a host under the thunder claps of a&#xD;
Wickliffe.&#xD;
Amid the rapid rustling of palm leaf and turkey tail&#xD;
fans, a hymn was thin sung to the tune of Peter Street,&#xD;
for the refreshment of those devotees.&#xD;
Rev. Mr. MilkwI ite's eyes were no longer on the&#xD;
ceiling. Doubtless the dove for which he had been&#xD;
looking had come dwn. And that 4ove, it appeared&#xD;
to my sinful mind, Mr. Milkwhite found rustling amid&#xD;
the muslins of the good dames before him, for there&#xD;
were his eyes now also, during the singing of one of&#xD;
Watt's beautiful hymng.&#xD;
Brother Peppergrass was then called on for a prayer,&#xD;
and the meeting knelt again.&#xD;
Mrs. Peppergras wvas deeply moved ; her sighs&#xD;
choked into gasps, her gasps grew into sobs, her sobs&#xD;
fell into tears, her tears dried into moans, and Mr. Milk-&#xD;
white noiselessly arose to comfort the afflicted dame.&#xD;
He knelt down by her side and softly placed his arm&#xD;
around that buxom waist, while with the hand of the&#xD;
other arm he tenderly brought the cheek of Mrs. Pep-&#xD;
pergrass on his own houlder. In this heart-moving,&#xD;
this comforting position, he gently consoled the afflicted&#xD;
Mrs. Peppergrass ith the words of hope and joy, till&#xD;
Mr. Peppergrass ceased praying.&#xD;
"Will Brother Dandelamb pray ?"&#xD;

tribulation, to that lately betrayed by the now calm&#xD;
Mrs. Peppergrass, and Mr. Milkwhite vouchsafed a no&#xD;
less touching condolence.&#xD;
"The meeting will now," he said, as Mr. Dandelamb&#xD;
closed his hearty, honest, simple appeal, "the meeting&#xD;
will now have a season of silent prayer."&#xD;
And the benevolent Mr. Milkwhite moved like an&#xD;
angel of mercy from man to man, and from wo an to&#xD;
woman, to comfort and relieve the o'erfraught  eart.&#xD;
How gently he laid his hand-a hand of pearl-o1 the&#xD;
shoulder of each distressed brother!  How tenderly&#xD;
he communed closely, face against face, with each&#xD;
sad sister !  A  chapter in the New Testament was&#xD;
then read. The attention given would be a mild&#xD;
reproach to any city auditory, it was almost ieath-&#xD;
less-except from the halm leaf and turkey tail fans.&#xD;
At length the readbir, with much emphasis, came to&#xD;
the words-" Be ye perfect."  No sooner was "per ect"&#xD;
uttered, than prone upon the floor fell three sisters and&#xD;
one brother, and so far as I could see, they were al in a&#xD;
swoon. There was some slight spasmodic action here&#xD;
and there, but in another moment, they all four lay pale&#xD;
and motionless.&#xD;
To my astonishment, this did not frighten Mr. ilk-&#xD;
white.&#xD;
"Where," said I resentfully to myself, " where now&#xD;
that tender care which, when the bodies of these simple&#xD;
people could sustain themselves, was too freely gran edi&#xD;
Oh! Milkwhite !"&#xD;

early _dreams but the spiritual presence of better things&#xD;
in a material after life ?"&#xD;
" Go on ! go on! you are so dull."&#xD;
Mabel 'knew everything as if by instinct. She read&#xD;
everybody as if by necromancy or astrology.   Yet&#xD;
although she knew so much, and read so many, every~-&#xD;
body loved Mabel. ()ne said she~ was so queer, another&#xD;
thought her funny. It was universally acknowledged&#xD;
&#xD;
MA BEL AND JoRAM.               tj&#xD;
that Mabel could keep a secret, and this gave her&#xD;
world of confidarts, so. that she knew everybody'&#xD;
secrets, my own, always, of course. Yet Mabel wa&#xD;
pure in heart, and he loved everything really pure an&#xD;
beautiful, with a perfect love, a vehement love, a by&#xD;
that made her happy, a love that knit her to me for ever.&#xD;
But then, how Mabel would ridicule everybody and&#xD;
everything. No one knew it except we at home. In&#xD;
truth, nobody knewM Mabel at all. No one thought that&#xD;
such a quiet child could be the life of the house: no&#xD;
one dreamed that she chirped and sang from daylight&#xD;
to midnight: no one knew that she could dance on her&#xD;
tip-toes, jump over chairs and a-top of tables, and per-&#xD;
form all the tricks of the gymnasium.&#xD;
So you perceive what a nondescript I have to&#xD;
describe, for nobody either knew anything or would&#xD;
believe anything about her. They thought her prudent,&#xD;
believed in her, confided in her, trusted in' her, and she&#xD;
was true to them all, and laughed at them all, and loved&#xD;
them all-but alas ! not as all would have her love&#xD;
them!&#xD;
Thus she grew up a little charming Sphinx, a riddle&#xD;
to us all, and. a fairy delight.  Mabel was quite&#xD;
independent in her notions ; neither Maud nor even her&#xD;
father could judge for her, and she believed in them to&#xD;
the skies, too; yet she had a sharp, joyous, innocent&#xD;
way of seeing and judging 'for herself, that, .I must&#xD;
confess, though her conclusions were often at war with&#xD;
my own, amused me beyond measure.&#xD;

I wish I could have reduced Mabel to&#xD;
love for me. She was as capricious as&#xD;
cock. She would have her little flirtat&#xD;
eyes-that's as far as Mabel ever went i&#xD;
of female frailty-so that her eyes were q&#xD;
all over the city. The awkward country&#xD;
pale young Presbyterian divine, with&#xD;
hair, the licentiate at the Catholic Presbyt&#xD;
eyes, the shabby genteel lawyer, the da&#xD;
dry-goode' man, the queer old bachel&#xD;
youngest boy and the last beau from ti&#xD;
vowed there was a peculiar meaning in&#xD;
which he alone knew how to solve-the&#xD;
flatterers, as if I did not know who alone&#xD;
deeply loved, notwithstanding her  api&#xD;
flirtations.&#xD;
Joram Jumps had not been at Mrs. M&#xD;
week, ere he had fallen a victim to her eye&#xD;
was as confident of his power of pleasi&#xD;
conquest over Mabel, as young gentlein&#xD;
are who have had but little intercourse wi&#xD;
Joram Jumps was a source of endless&#xD;

Tery like' acci-&#xD;
&#xD;
dent that Joram'never suspected any one, and least of&#xD;
all the quiet little tender-eyed Mabel.&#xD;
Joram often stumbled over objects in the dark hall&#xD;
going, to bed, when the lights were all extinguished,&#xD;
accidentally, of course. Joram sometimes complained&#xD;
that Mrs. Bowes had made his bed in a very uncommon&#xD;
manner. Joram found notes in the post-office from&#xD;
young damsels dying for him.    But Joram   always&#xD;
brought these oft missives straight to Mabel, and to&#xD;
please her in a lelcate way, would cut them to pieces&#xD;
with his jack-knife and throw them on the fire in her&#xD;
presence. He never to this day has suspected. Mabel&#xD;
Latrobe of all the flattering attentions bestowed upon&#xD;
him from such diverse quarters.&#xD;
Joram was not destitute of'-natural ability. He pro-&#xD;
gressed rapidly at Dr. Oliphant's, but now his studies&#xD;
begin to flag. In truth, Joram is in love. Mabel sees&#xD;
it, we all know it, and Mabel is the only one that does&#xD;
not seem to enjoy it after all. Mabel grows grave, alas,&#xD;
has she lost her heart likewise ? No, Mabel is really too&#xD;
good to enjoy any one's misery, and Joram is evidently&#xD;
in tribulation. Yet the son of stout Farmer Jumps is&#xD;
no weak dangler, no persecuting step-slave. Joram is&#xD;
independent in his feelings.&#xD;
On one evening, seeing Mabel alone in the library&#xD;
after tea, he glided in, and, seated himself stiffly. He&#xD;
closed his hands on his lap' devoutly, and then folded&#xD;
his arms across his breast thoughtfully, and then clasped.&#xD;
his hands behind his bead boldly, and'then coughed a&#xD;

RE A DER, had you ever a friend for whom you felt '&#xD;
degree of responsibility "in certain circles ?"' If so was&#xD;
not your friend sure to commit'all his fai pas, say all&#xD;
his silliest things, do his most awkward and extraordi-&#xD;

Major Fontenoy was always my beau ideal of the&#xD;
gentleman. The point was disputed by Mabel, who&#xD;
preferred Allen, and by Guilfotd, who was tbo matter-&#xD;
of-fact to enjoy the Major's sentimentality.&#xD;
Even Maud smiled at hini. Walter felt responsible&#xD;
for his friend, and thought the apparent excess of senti-&#xD;
ment, nothing worse than a  flowering of the Major's&#xD;
exquisite nature.&#xD;
"iNor," said I, " is he sentimental on all occasions ; it&#xD;
is here, in this house, beneath the eyes of Maud  arch,&#xD;
that my dear old friend appears toso poor advantage.",&#xD;
But with all reasonings and all efforts on my part, the&#xD;
good Major never seemed to do himself justice at Lilac&#xD;
Cottage. In all other places the gallant soldier cap-&#xD;
tivated right and left.&#xD;
We were sitting one evening after a summer rain,&#xD;

upon the porch, enjoying the fresh fragrance of the&#xD;
earth, and the awakened perfume of the flowers, when&#xD;
Major Fontenoy came up the lawn.     He advanced&#xD;
towards us in a sprightly manner-a little too sprightly&#xD;
for his years-th hypercritical label thought. This&#xD;
peculiarity was noticed afar.&#xD;
"See !" said Guilford, smiling, " I suppose Walter&#xD;
would term that, ' graceful motion.' "&#xD;
"No," replied Walter "the major never will be&#xD;
graceful,. oi in any way himself, when Maid is within&#xD;
view."I&#xD;
I went forward to meet him.&#xD;
"How lovely the evening after a shower, hey !" said&#xD;
my friend, as he drew near the ladies, and lifted his cap&#xD;
handsomely.&#xD;
"Yes, major," replied Mrs. March, " will you walk up&#xD;
and join us ? we are all out enjoying the freshness."&#xD;
"It is as sweet" he said taking a seat, "as the breath&#xD;
of cattle on the lea, hey Walter? your friend old&#xD;
Brindle, hey !"&#xD;
The breath of cattle is .charming, yet altogether the&#xD;
comparison did not quite suit-some people are so fas-&#xD;
tidious. I warmly replied, "Yes sir," with a smile of&#xD;
appreciation.&#xD;
"What has the fair lady Maud- been doiiig to-day?&#xD;
Sitting in her bower, hey !"&#xD;
"Yes, major, if' by bower you mean my school."&#xD;
Maud was innocent of offence, yet the major blushed,&#xD;
swing how inapropos was this 'second comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Temple, I might say with more propriety, hey I&#xD;
sweet oddess, hey!"&#xD;
N ,no !" saidK[aud laughing, "I should rather say&#xD;
plain ld school-house."&#xD;
She stepped down the porch, plucked a sweet pea&#xD;
blosso n, and handed it to Major Fontenoy.&#xD;
The old gentleman joined the laugh, w ith his heart&#xD;
full of simple ready glee. Then he grew silent. It was&#xD;
only i i Maud's presence the agreeable talker ever was&#xD;
silent.&#xD;
Gui ford then spoke of meeting a soldier of the garri-&#xD;
son, wh o told him slily he had got on the sick list by&#xD;
playin old soldier with the surgeon, and came down in&#xD;
town o have his fun.&#xD;
The major had an anecdote ready in a moment.&#xD;
"O course you allremember Surgeon Prim, stationed&#xD;
here a few years ago, hey ! Well, a. soldier came into&#xD;
the dispensary one morning with his tongue whitened&#xD;
with  alk, hey. Doctor asked him what's the matter?$&#xD;
'Feve, sir,' hey! touching his hat, hey! 'How do&#xD;

No one could resist one of the major's&#xD;
excitement and drollery seemed to ma&#xD;
story good. He never put "hey 1" after&#xD;
and that made it appear the 1pore ludicro&#xD;
Of course we all laughed; Mabel, as&#xD;
on all such occasions, fairly shouted.&#xD;
The conversation turned next on book&#xD;

latest works. On the whole, what with&#xD;
his beautiful cameos, that payment affai&#xD;
and his fun; we all loved the major-thou&#xD;
degrees, and for various reasons.&#xD;
"Does Maud love the major ?" Guilfor&#xD;
me, as we went around the outside of the&#xD;
the barn, for a look at Brindle's calf.&#xD;
" Why do you inquire of me?"&#xD;
Oh, you, are something of a connoi&#xD;

"Oh ! ahem, yes; I don't think the mi&#xD;
her."&#xD;
Then why so many costly gifts ?"&#xD;
"Because he can't help it, I suppose.'&#xD;
"But why does Maud take them ?"&#xD;
" Why, for the same reason, I suppose."&#xD;
"You may think as- you please, Walte&#xD;

They now stood in a closely shaded part of the&#xD;

"Love, Miss Maud, ;hey! love, hey!"&#xD;

The major dropped   pon liis knees. He took the&#xD;

"Love me, hey! 2L ove me, hey! Bekold me at&#xD;

OuR path towards the bush went by a beautiful farm&#xD;
through which ran a winding rivulet, overlooked by a&#xD;
little green bank near the roadside. In the string time&#xD;
this bank was carpeted with a multitude of wild flow-&#xD;
ers, dandelions, aster flowers, violets, and 'anemones. It&#xD;
was canopied overhead by the profuse. branches of a&#xD;
grove of young butternut trees, up and along which&#xD;
the fox grape climbed and trailed its vines, forcing many&#xD;
a graceful festoon.&#xD;
Here it was often our delight to pause as  e strolled&#xD;
out on pleasant Sunday afternoons after old Brindle-.&#xD;
Guilford could not leave his business on week-days. To&#xD;
sit or lie here on the grass and build air-castls, each in&#xD;
his own way, was for years our romance and light.&#xD;

"As, for Maud," continued he, "she should marry&#xD;

"The hear of the daughter of one who was o&#xD;

"I am very sorry, Mr. Magroy," spoke the major,&#xD;
again sitting down, :"that circumstances should have&#xD;
brought about this scene, hey!"&#xD;
"Please proceed, Major Fontenoy, proceed," replied&#xD;
Mr. Magroy meekly, sipping his wine and. water.&#xD;
"My object in calling, sir, was in a friendly way to&#xD;
reconcile you to your son, the best- young man I ever&#xD;
knew, hey ! as well as to set the conduct of other per-&#xD;
sons, the subject of our late conversation, in a fair light&#xD;
before you, hey! you will please perceive that I had&#xD;
no vulgar desire of meddling with your affairs, hey !"&#xD;
"I will apologize," exclaimed the old man in a whin-&#xD;
ing tone.&#xD;
"No apologies necessary, hey !" continued the major,&#xD;
somewhat gentler in manner, and less dry and cold in&#xD;
tone.&#xD;
" What I wish, sir, is more ample satisfaction,&#xD;
hey!"&#xD;
"What, sir, do you want !" -demanded Mr. Magroy&#xD;
peevishly--for an LL.D.&#xD;
"That you heal these unhappy differences by a simple&#xD;
act of justice."&#xD;
Mr. Magroy sipped his wine and water, and tapped&#xD;
his cane on the table in silent abstraction a long time.&#xD;
Finally he said,&#xD;
"Major Fontenoy, you will pardon me 'for bringing&#xD;
this neighborly conference\ to an' end, sir. But if you&#xD;
please, I will confer, with the parties. In short, sir, I&#xD;

"Mighty little honor," quoth he.&#xD;
"There may be some in his heart," said I.&#xD;
"I don't believe in fire till I see either smoke or&#xD;

"Not if you scent it out $" asked I, returning to the&#xD;
rescue of charity. "The old fellow evinced shame at&#xD;

you may be certain the noble Roman, Honor fQllows&#xD;

At this moment, happening to look from the library,&#xD;
through the lilac trees, upon the mottled lawn, who&#xD;
should we behold but the old Scotsman coming over the&#xD;
grass, stamping his cane, and looking down like Winter&#xD;
trampling on the lingering train of Autumn. Guilford&#xD;
seized his hat and departed for the warehouse. He met&#xD;
Mr. Magroy. That -good-natured gentleman stopped&#xD;

his services in the field.' Detained at home by family&#xD;
afflictions, he requested me to "take the stmp," as we&#xD;
say at home. Accordingly I commenced operations at&#xD;
Cambridge, the scene of my college and mock court&#xD;
achievements, such as they were ; made a happy hit; my&#xD;
fame was.noi ed abroad through the Boston papers-my&#xD;

CHAPTER XXV.&#xD;
THE YOUNG COMMODORE.&#xD;
ON returning to his castle, did Mr. Magroy notice&#xD;
Mrs. Polypheniia Fidgets' face at the window?2 Did he&#xD;
see her shrink away?  Did the good man of the house&#xD;
know that his worst enemy still presided over the con-&#xD;
cerns of that abode of peace and happiness?&#xD;
Mrs. Poly had but o 'e eye, yet Mrs. Polyphemia saw&#xD;
a long way. For instance, she saw that the illumination&#xD;
of her master's mind' concerning a variety of little&#xD;
matters, was nothing more than a rift in the cloud, which&#xD;
must soon close again,  asking darkness darker. Mean-&#xD;
time, she saw it was h r policy to keep out of his way&#xD;
-she would soon render her services, her ver presence,&#xD;
nay, heir counsels,'necesary ; for even that massive, com-&#xD;
pact mind must put forth little tendrils, feeling for sym-&#xD;
pathy.&#xD;
Mr. Magroy closeted with his will and his Bible; bde&#xD;
changes one and consults the other daily. Now he is&#xD;
seen busy writing, and again he compares himself:.with&#xD;
all scriptural characters, from outcast Adam to the&#xD;
stricken widow of Nain.&#xD;
By artful and gradual approaches, the spider Fidgets,&#xD;
&#xD;
TH E YOT'G COMMODORE.&#xD;
&#xD;
drew the great bluebottle fly Magroy, into the toils of&#xD;
her mazy net. In less' than a-month, she had gained an&#xD;
influence over her victim,; more powerful than ever  It&#xD;
may be needless, to ay that the light which had lately&#xD;
broken in upon his troubled-soul with referenc'to the&#xD;
arches, the fear, th e shame and the self-reproach, all&#xD;
gradually vanished, and left him a blind listener to the&#xD;
isinuations of Mr. Fidgets. A   new element soo"'&#xD;
mingled in the blindfold war raging witi$Pihim.--avarice.&#xD;
Mr. Magroy never lad been an avaricious man-neve-&#xD;
since the period of his youth,-Mony  was lavished&#xD;
upon Mrs. Magroy more profusely that, that prudent&#xD;
woman required:    llen knew no stint until he left the&#xD;
paternal roof. Even Mrs: Fidgets had, until ncw, lived&#xD;
in silks and clover:&#xD;
Now, Mr. Magroy is a miser.&#xD;
This interesting change in our neighbor's character&#xD;
first came known to us, on the occasion of Guilford's&#xD;
calling to pay the las.installment on Lilac Cottage.&#xD;
",Mr: Guilford   arch, believev, air," said Mr.&#xD;
Magroy, as my broth r entered the office.&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Magroy" replied the latter respectfully.&#xD;
"Your mother, sir "&#xD;
"Is well, Mr. Iagroy?'&#xD;
" Is a what ?"' he cried.'&#xD;
" Quite well, sir."&#xD;
"My son been to your house of late, as much as ever.&#xD;
I suppose ?"&#xD;
"No sir, he has not entered our hous"for year."&#xD;

Guilford.&#xD;
But happily he caught sight of the little canvas bag&#xD;
in which Guilford ha brought the silver and gold for&#xD;
the payment. His ey s glistened with unnatural fire as&#xD;
he looked, forgetting everything else.&#xD;
"Ah ! I know you pant to pay, sir. Let me see the&#xD;
in t the coin, sir! !uick !a, and the poor creature-&#xD;
poor with-all his wealth, learning, and honors-hurriedly&#xD;
advanced to clutch the object of greed.&#xD;
Guilford drew back saying firmly-&#xD;
"Stay Mr. Magroy, you forget yourself, sir. The&#xD;
papers first--the bill of sale, pote, deed."&#xD;
"Oh ! yes," he answered, in' a plaintive tone, that&#xD;
ancient over-bearing temper humbled to the dust.&#xD;
The papers were delivered as soon as the trembling&#xD;
miser had counted, weighed, and inly devoured each&#xD;
piece. separately, as he, tooksit from the bag. Guilford&#xD;
felt a thrill of pleasure as. he took in possession the evi-&#xD;
dences of Mrs. March's sole estate in Lilac Cottage.&#xD;
He gave notice to Mr. Magroy, that he should ere&#xD;
long repurchase the cut-off lot, and bidding him good-&#xD;
morning, he went home to, make holiday with the&#xD;
family.&#xD;
Not long afterwards, Guilford was surprised ;to see&#xD;
NMr. Magroy enter the. counting-room of the waiehouse-&#xD;
He passed through the office without deigning to notice&#xD;

Magroy passed through again, went out; Mr. Mayflower&#xD;
came in, rubbing his hands.&#xD;
"Guilford, what do you think old Mr. Magroy-has.&#xD;
proposed "&#xD;
"What, sir?"&#xD;
"Why to enter into a co-partnership with me, ha! ha-!&#xD;

"Whysir," replied my brother, "under the present&#xD;

out of your difficulties"&#xD;
" I thought of that too. But what do you think was&#xD;
the condition upon which he was to favor me with, his&#xD;
assistance ?"&#xD;
"I cannot imagine, sir" said Guilford, nibbing a pen&#xD;
with his knife.&#xD;
S" On the easy condition that I discharge you."&#xD;
At that moment the edge of my brother's. pen-knife&#xD;
went through the pen, and almost through the thumb&#xD;
nail.&#xD;
" What, sir f"&#xD;
"That I discharge you.,&#xD;

But Mr. Mayflower was a gentleman f simple-per-&#xD;

experience with Soltem and the Skeleton-that gr ti-&#xD;

artisans, challenging sister cities for competitions, and&#xD;
carrying, or rather staggering under pecuniary burdens&#xD;
that, would crush a score of less able men together.&#xD;
All he wanted," he said, was a little more "young&#xD;
blood," and now he has it.&#xD;
These excitements aroused the. best energies of Guik&#xD;
ford March. If he had genius, it lay in -contrivances,&#xD;
or fetching 'things about, and now all the powers of his&#xD;
mind were drawn into play by a business demanding&#xD;
great ability,. It had likewise its pleasures. The rivalry&#xD;
the patronage, the launch, the contract with sailors and&#xD;
shipbuilders--frank, hearty, honest, friendly, often disc&#xD;
interested classes both-quickened:and ennobled the&#xD;
pulse of life. Hi early fondness for the water,.too, was&#xD;
gratified in a modified, but agreeable form. He' went&#xD;
at times from port to port, crossing the wind-tossed&#xD;
white caps of Lie Erie, or the miany-hued surface of&#xD;
Lake Huron; he dashed down the rapids of the St.&#xD;
Lawrence, and sailed beneath the picture rocks of grand&#xD;
old unknown Superior--passing on his way, or;pausing&#xD;
to gaze upon the Arch Rock, and Sugar Loaf, where the&#xD;
mythologic Indian gods once dwelt in Maekinaw--.the&#xD;
Mount Olympus of the Red man-but still more nearly&#xD;
interesting to Guilford' as the scenes of his father's&#xD;
gentle intercourse with Indians 'and Frenchunen.&#xD;

rtiness of his manner, rendered the good-looking&#xD;

Dock life, so to call Guilford's present career, gives&#xD;
rise to a peculiar species of men... To be sure, there is&#xD;
a flavor of tar - and oakum perceptible, yet tar and&#xD;
oakum  ore often valuable to fill the chinks of leaky&#xD;
veessels; and bluff, hearty, even rough usages may tend&#xD;
toetopte small crevices of a weak nature-4he better&#xD;
able to buffet, with: the waves of life. A man on the&#xD;
dock is apt to be sound, and tough-hearted for the right,l&#xD;
and independent, combining part of the bluff honesty&#xD;
if the sailor, and part of-the thriving industry of the&#xD;
Iandsman . He launches vessels on whose decks little&#xD;
communities live and labor, .nd do battle with wind&#xD;

interest' and sympathjs stretch abroad to them. Hun-&#xD;
eds;, perhaps' thousands,, with their wives and little&#xD;
onen depend upon his enterprise and. calculation, his&#xD;
p    oden:e, foresight and humanity. And he feels a&#xD;
snse of power. .Power, that necessity to a. human&#xD;

It is unnecessary to detail all the steps we took  t he&#xD;
business for which I had come. There were several&#xD;
difficulties to be encountered.  There was WI one&#xD;
member of Congress fromour State. The   r&#xD;
faction of the constitue cy, howeverwas so  ge that&#xD;
we were allowed two ca ets. It wasthecutom gener-&#xD;
ally for the member to o4inate the' cadet,' but as there&#xD;
were -two, the natter ws. shared between the member&#xD;
and our two senators. Yet neither senator had the&#xD;
power of nomination. Thus all depended :pon the&#xD;
member. These facts we learnt by visiting the secre&#xD;
tary of warthe -enginee bureau, and the commander&#xD;
in-chief. To . the last  delivered Major.'onten&#xD;
letter. The commande-in-chief expressed much plea-&#xD;
sure at hearing from the gallant major, whom he called&#xD;
an ornament to the army. But he said he had no influi-&#xD;
ence in the administration of army affairs, was con-&#xD;
sulted in no appointment or other matt rs of nioniaet.&#xD;
My eyes filled-I had such weak eyes--as theyazed;&#xD;

so small a matter to a statesman.&#xD;
'The rules of our office, sir," said M&#xD;
very precise. I may say, sir, absurdly pi&#xD;
"I should think so, too!" sneered&#xD;
M.O. " But what's wrong now ?"&#xD;
"The endorsement, sir: all right but&#xD;
of much importance, easily mistaken for t&#xD;
but the rules of the office, sir, require"&#xD;
".Let me see what you refer to."&#xD;
That word,'recommendation,' sir; sh&#xD;
nation."&#xD;
"Pshaw1" said the honorable membe&#xD;
a constituency of seventy thousand, as h&#xD;
the paper, "is that all? the words mean t&#xD;
or neai'ly so."&#xD;
Mr. Tapes was evidently at a nonplus.&#xD;
"You will pardon me, Mr. Hustings,"&#xD;
surely you cannot allow the great friend&#xD;
shown meain this matter, all to go for not&#xD;
Mr. Hustings looked, or rather leered'&#xD;
doubtful, inquiring, half-shut eye.&#xD;
"The cause of 'widow and orphans, s&#xD;
justly assert to be uppermost in your th&#xD;
the peace, happiness, and prosperity o&#xD;

" I cannot encourage this sort of dictationsfrom the&#xD;
departments, sir," h replied, uneasily, as if wishing to&#xD;
divert me from  A manner   f speech impossible to&#xD;
interpret.&#xD;
"Sir, you are too noble ! too liberal ! to take issue&#xD;
with them on the difference of a shade of meaning in a&#xD;
word ?"&#xD;
"Well, give me the letter," he said, petulantly. Mr.&#xD;
Tapes handedit to him eagerly. "There," said he, as he&#xD;
erased the objectionable term, and wrote the necessary&#xD;
one over it, " I believe thi4 offlce- of chief engineer&#xD;
should be abolished, and the business of fortification&#xD;
controlled by a committee of Congress, as it was in the&#xD;
French Revolution."&#xD;
Mr. Tapes and myself beat a hasty retreat, lear-&#xD;
ing the member to arrange| the details of his com-&#xD;
mittee.&#xD;
"Does that secure it beyond a doubt ?" I asked.&#xD;
"Unquestionably," he cried' with joy. I called for a&#xD;
carriage.&#xD;
"Take this gentleman to tle War Office," I said to&#xD;
the driver; ith exultation. 'c What is your charge P"&#xD;
cc1&#xD;
"Two dol ars, massa!1"&#xD;
"The villain," Fexclaimed Tapes, stepping back from&#xD;
the open door, "it's only worth "--&#xD;
" Never mind the price," I said; pushing him in, and&#xD;
throwing the driver two Spanish dollars.&#xD;
On that evening my warrant was sent to ]i. Latrobe,&#xD;
whose congratulations were .ihowered upon me with,&#xD;

every demonstration of joy and affection M. Latrobe&#xD;
also handed me a short letter from my eldest brother&#xD;
John, inclosing, a bank note of considerale value, and&#xD;
inviting me-pressing me-I may say,, to come on to&#xD;
Canbridge and visit him until the June term at West&#xD;
Point should commence. I loitered i the political&#xD;
Metropolis of the nation, long enough to study the&#xD;
architecture of. the public buildings,  ear the most&#xD;
eminent orators speak, and pay visits of farewell to my&#xD;
friends Dick and Mary, the clergyman, nd Mr. Tapes&#xD;
-with whom I dined.-&#xD;
Dick said that when the administration broke up he'd&#xD;
like to return to good old Detroit. Mar told me con-&#xD;
fidentially she was dying to go there, to . I promised&#xD;
to find, if possible, a place that might e able them to&#xD;
settle down comfortably, and took my leave of them&#xD;
with a full heart.&#xD;
Tapes said, coming with me to the door of his lodg-&#xD;
ings, he had a word of advice that he would respectfully&#xD;
suggest.&#xD;
"Speak it out,, dear sir. I am not he head of a&#xD;
bureau, that you should hesitate."&#xD;
"Then, Mr. Walter, don't graduate from West Point&#xD;
into the engineers."&#xD;
" Don't believe I could, if I wished."&#xD;
" Don't try to, sir. Don't try."&#xD;
" But what is the objection ?"&#xD;
" O ! sir, your brain would turn into line water, you&#xD;
would be but the carbonate of a man-a walk-&#xD;
&#xD;
THE ffIEL  WON.&#xD;
&#xD;
ing stalagmite or stalactite your building materials&#xD;
would go to waste."&#xD;
Ignorant of what he meant, but profoundly impressed&#xD;
with his manner, I squeezed Mr. Tapes' hand, and we&#xD;
said good-bye!&#xD;
The secret of thepoor gentleman's dislike must lave&#xD;
laid in the eternal routine of his own duties, year in and&#xD;
year out, casting up costs, quantities and qualities, of&#xD;
"building materials for works of fortification."&#xD;
John March's liberality enabled me to travel "like a&#xD;
gentleman," as M. Latrobe would-say.&#xD;
Walter took passage in the railway cars for New&#xD;
York, and in seven days found himself, neither, at West&#xD;
Point as he expected, nor at Cambridge, where he was&#xD;
invited, but at Detroit, where he was delighted, with&#xD;
Major Fontenoy, studying mathenatics,.and with Mabel&#xD;
Latrobe, studying her, himself, and the tender passion.&#xD;

"Did he say the gentleman wished to eep it?"V&#xD;

Guilford and I were reclining on Air Castle Bank one&#xD;
serene Sunday afternoon in May, ien we observed an&#xD;
un'nal column of smoke rising over the spot we always&#xD;
fatcied ourlouse to occupy. We started t our feet,&#xD;
a1d commenced running towards the city, but the&#xD;
cohumxn growing more and more slender, and finally&#xD;
dying away entirely, we proceeded home more lei-&#xD;
surely.&#xD;
On reaching the lawn we found articles o: furniture&#xD;
lying in confusion on the grass in front' of the cottage.&#xD;
There were one or two damped blankets spread out on&#xD;
the root which was hi'red and black for the space of a&#xD;
fe feet around the chium y at one of the gable ends of&#xD;
the roof. On going rad tothat side of the house we&#xD;
s awthe blackened water still coursing down over the&#xD;
clapboards to the, ground. It seems that the chimney&#xD;
had taken fire, which communicated by soman means to,&#xD;
the wod-vork around thie chimney, and undOr the roof-&#xD;
o     first saw it, ran in and gave the alakm. There&#xD;

}  lj e the melancholy gentleman no happier, strange as&#xD;
this may appear to the friends of that judicious lady.&#xD;
n the contrary, Mr. Magroy fell a grey to a thousand&#xD;
hallucinations. Major Fontenoy wa going to'kill him.&#xD;
Guilford March-had a mortgage on hs princely mansion,&#xD;
and was soon to turn him and h's wife into the streets.&#xD;
Miss Mand March was jealous of his wife. The doctor&#xD;
had designs on the hand of Mrs. Magroy.&#xD;
Why sir !' expostulated the doctor, "your wife's&#xD;
no buxom lass, no beauty, sir ! What do I, already a&#xD;
man of family want of her ? The old hag I" mutter-ed&#xD;
Doctor Mendr himself.&#xD;
"Sir " said Mr' Magroy, rising  p in his bed, and&#xD;
pointing his loig emaciated finger towards the door of&#xD;
the room occupied by his wife. "Let her fix her fasci-&#xD;
natingae" on any man in America, and he's gone.&#xD;
Theresano,   sting thateye," he added, falling back&#xD;
exhausted:&#xD;
Mr.FMagr' most co     on hallucination was that of&#xD;
the conspiracy. Eyery boring his oney was counted&#xD;
Over..That Iich h held in the bak was withdrawn&#xD;
and placed in the iron chest in hi office, where the&#xD;
haunted being slept. = The roon was provided with dou-&#xD;
ble doors, and the windows were grated with bars of&#xD;
iron. Thus Mr. Magroy had,becom  his own prisoner,&#xD;
and beyond dispute, the worst jailer a wretch can have&#xD;
is his own feas. He fancied, in hi darkest moments,&#xD;
that Allen was seeking his life, and his alternate ana-&#xD;
t'e mas on the head of hiss son, and s reeches for mercy&#xD;

"'Thy forgiveness Allen. I have wron ed thee. Qh!&#xD;

Allen was silently weeping. M. Latrobe had already&#xD;
dispatched a messenger after Doctor Mendry. The&#xD;
clerk of the court brought a pitcher of water. Mr.&#xD;
Magroy drank and grew apparently easier.&#xD;
"Is she here Allen "&#xD;
"Who, my father ?"&#xD;
"Who? who but Maud the daughter of my old&#xD;
friend ? The aughter of the only woman I ever loved,&#xD;
and whom I n ver forgave for marrying him.&#xD;
" Is she herd $ quick! good people, quick !"&#xD;
My mother and Maud stood near the wretched dying&#xD;
man.&#xD;
"Here is Maud," said M. Latrobe.&#xD;
"Truly she   I grow blind and dizzy," he murmured,&#xD;
and a new fit f coughing up blood ensued.&#xD;
More water was administered. His voice came back.&#xD;
"Give me dour hand, Allen. You forgive me&#xD;
"God knows I do, and did long, long ago."&#xD;
"Now hers, haste !" he cried.&#xD;
M. Latrobe placed the hand of my sister in that of&#xD;
the cold, quivering man.&#xD;
He put it in Allen's.&#xD;
"My children, be hap-py!'&#xD;
Doctor Mendry urged his way through the crowd.&#xD;

and follows afar. He has just purchased and fitted up&#xD;
Millbrook ,cottage, and, with a pony phaeton, il1&#xD;
drive into town o do his business. He hopes in a f W&#xD;
years to be able to retire, and abandon the exciting&#xD;
world for the soothing employments of rustic lif-&#xD;
that is, on a large scale."&#xD;
The scene changes, and the major and myself stand in&#xD;
the library of ilac Cottage, in the midst of perfurmed&#xD;
bouquets, floatin veils, white gloves and flowing robes.&#xD;
Here is the Rest. Mr. Cradle, now D.D., but Doctor&#xD;
Cradle don't sound familiar quite yet. And here is&#xD;
M. Latrobe to give away the brides. And here is the&#xD;
mother-I was going to say-of both brides. And here&#xD;
finally are the major, John and his wife, and Guilford&#xD;
March.&#xD;
Wedding guests are waiting in parlor and hall. Tae&#xD;
door is thrown open. Dr. Cradle moves forward ,in&#xD;
advance, the tw happy couples, follow after. Alln&#xD;

THE BATTLE OF WINDSOR&#xD;
A FRONTIER EPISODE.&#xD;
Oxi evenin   my brother Guilford and myself were&#xD;
out enjoying    eauties of such a blue stai-lit sky as&#xD;
King March sometimes canopies himself under after the&#xD;
tumult of a storm. .A little way above the city we&#xD;
were overtaken by a sturdy-looking pedestrian, with a&#xD;
knapsack strapped to his shoulders, and a belt around&#xD;
his waist, to"'which were fastened a bowie-knife and a&#xD;
tin cup.&#xD;
"That is a patriot," whispered Guilford.&#xD;
The city was filled with Canadian refuges, together&#xD;
with a promiscuous gathering from various parts of the&#xD;
United States, intent on taking part in the quarrel&#xD;
between the provinces and the mother country. Th&#xD;
people along the Apier4an frontier sympathied deeply&#xD;
with the, revolutionists-and'it was whispered among&#xD;
the qd inrnes, that even gentlemen connected with&#xD;
both state and general governments contributed secretly&#xD;
to the cause. For these reasons, unless men were found&#xD;
actually 'asnib led in arms, they were no likely t&#xD;
be moieied-ndividuals, notoriously knovn to be&#xD;
'patriots,"came anal went openly.&#xD;

Shall we go to the encampment ?"&#xD;
Wgter.-" It would be quite an unexpected adven-&#xD;

Guilford.-" I take it, messmate, you are a patriot."&#xD;
Stranger.-" Yes, shouldn't wonder. What of it ?"&#xD;
Guilfor.-"From Ohio ?"&#xD;
Stranger.-" No, Canada. What of it?"&#xD;
Giilford.-".,re there many Canadians here now?"&#xD;
Stranger.     ry few.  But we fight in earnest:&#xD;
but what of'it? we fight for our country, not fir plunder;&#xD;
I wish there were more of us. You Yankees 'talk a deal&#xD;
in the papers, and make great speeches, but when it&#xD;
comes to actual fighting you'd rather let it out. But&#xD;
what of it ? all the same in a hundred years"&#xD;
falter.--" Are you an Englishman ?"&#xD;
Stranger.-" No, I emigrated from York State with&#xD;
my father and folks fifteen years ago, and settled not far&#xD;
from Hamilton. We got on very well till this revolu-&#xD;
tion, began to make a stir. Then we were suspected&#xD;
right off. What of it? cried I-right as well be hung&#xD;
for an old sheep as a lamb. So I raised all the money I&#xD;
could, and determined to devote myself to the good&#xD;
cause. My father was pretty old, but as niany of the&#xD;
people around p swei secretly patriots, he thought he&#xD;
could take bare of my young wife and the two unhiaried&#xD;
girls. The night after I left, gentlemen, my house Wa6&#xD;

ness all around. A e.ieket chirped beneath a stone,.at&#xD;
my feet, while: a ground sparrow sprang to thero&#xD;
above, charming the senses with his homely, familiar&#xD;
sonnets. Lulled by the ripple of the river, soothed by&#xD;
the delicious calmness of the atmosphere, and shamed&#xD;

till their curiosity seemed satisfied. Others again, drew&#xD;
nigh, and peered into my face. One said, "Ee is oneof&#xD;

By degrees they formed themselves: into: groups&#xD;

360   SHOEPAC RECOLLECTIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
late in their day, and seeing them through the medium&#xD;
of childhood, we have not ventured, in these sketches, to&#xD;
attempt more than to throw an occasional flickering ray&#xD;
upon the manners and customs of the simple race.&#xD;
With some of the peculiarities of those who have sup-&#xD;
planted them, especially the earlier folk, who caught&#xD;
not a little of their genial light and warmth, our&#xD;
memory is more at home. It may be a pleasure for&#xD;
some, whose pulse is beating high beneath the torrid&#xD;
zone of the present, to have gazed for one short hour&#xD;
upon the cool region of a temperate past-yesterday but&#xD;
still a part of to-day.&#xD;
