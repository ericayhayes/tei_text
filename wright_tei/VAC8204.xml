Four or five women once that tended me?&#xD;
Ti~XWEST.&#xD;

"Standing with reluctant feet&#xD;
Where the brook and river meet,&#xD;
Womanhood and childhood fleet"--&#xD;
when there came a ige in our outward circumstgiees.&#xD;
During my first years, we had enjoyed what some of our&#xD;
ancestors had toiled for; and my father after each d1ay's&#xD;
soaring and diving into philosophy and science walked about&#xD;
our garden in silk stockings and with a rose in his mouth,-.&#xD;
at that time I was a little thing that the rosebushes looked&#xD;
down upon. And I looked up to them, with admiring eyes&#xD;
that often went higher still, and took in the straw hat that&#xD;
Mr. Howard wore of Ai afternoon: certainly that hat nas&#xD;
a miracle for all purposes of shade and adornment.&#xD;
Our winters-"were spent in to*ii, and in the long evenings&#xD;
I, perched on a chair by ,ny'father, studied wit h  the&#xD;

strange German and French names which he pronounced so&#xD;
easily, and sometimes hiding them with my hand, to test his&#xD;
skill or recollection. Pleasant little unbound packages !-&#xD;
pleasant to me still is the thought of their brown and yellow&#xD;
covers as they lay piled on the pier-table, whither my feet&#xD;
made frequent journeys, as bundle after bundle was exhaust-&#xD;
ed. And Kate would look up from her studies and say,&#xD;
"Another one already !-why how fast you get on to-&#xD;
night."&#xD;
And I would reply,&#xD;
"0O it's only St. Bruno-and we didn't want to see him."&#xD;
Then at other times there was .talk,-often above my&#xD;
comprehension, and where I could only amuse myself with&#xD;
the different looks and tones of the speakers; with Kate's&#xD;
earnestness and my father's coolness, and with Mrs. How-&#xD;
ard's smile at them both and at my listening face. If my&#xD;
father caught sight of this last, he would often end the lesson&#xD;
he was giving with some laughing remark to me.&#xD;
"It is well you are a little younger than Kate, Gracie, or&#xD;
I should do nothing but answer questions."&#xD;
And to reward my close attention he would give us a&#xD;
long account of some one of his favourite shells,-where it&#xD;
was found, and how it was obtained, and what its former&#xD;
inhabitant lived on,-or now and then a mineral was the&#xD;
text; but there I soon lost footing again, between the crust&#xD;
of the earth and its different strata. And yet though my&#xD;
thoughts could grasp but very little of such subjects, they&#xD;
seldom came down without someoken of where they had&#xD;
been-a kind of stepping-stone foi e next effort.&#xD;
" To labour, and to be content, th what a man hath, is&#xD;
a sweet life," says some wise proveb: of the first clause&#xD;
we had then no experience, but for a time we did prove the&#xD;
second, and the conclusion.&#xD;
Then came the years of speculation, when money seemed&#xD;
as inexhaustible as the gold of California, and far more easily&#xD;
come by. No labour nor content now,-the bargain of&#xD;
yesterday sold for five thousand dollars advance to-day;&#xD;
with almost as little ceremony as in the Irishman's "Done&#xD;
and done, is enough between two jantlemen."-e&#xD;
I thought and cared little about the matter-even the tan-&#xD;
gible part of it; though I certainly found it pleasant to ride to&#xD;

- Levy's, and see muslins and silks bought for me'; and also&#xD;
to pay as many visits as I liked to the candy shops,-but I&#xD;
had never felt the want of money, and knew not its value-.&#xD;
even so much as a child may know. It seems strange to me&#xD;
now, to think of accounts at the Bank,-of the time when&#xD;
cheques cost but a scratch of my father's pen.-.As I have&#xD;
said, there came a change.&#xD;
It came, and was at work some -time before it reached my&#xD;
understanding; and the tokens of its progress puzzled and&#xD;
sometimes disturbed me-giving a sort of check like a hand-.&#xD;
ful of earth thrown on a young plant's head. But the in&#xD;
pulse of life and spirits was too strong-and after a few"&#xD;
minutes the shoot would push its way through the encum-&#xD;
bering soil, and shake off the last particle from its un-tear-&#xD;
wet leaves.&#xD;
"Mamma," I said on one of these occasions, "tat,&#xD;
must have sent home .the wrong handkerchiefs-these ae&#xD;
near so fine as my last set.")&#xD;
"I know they are not, Gracie," she answered.&#xD;
The words struck me with a sort of surprise. That m  YM&#xD;
stepmother should have done a thing of intent, was as much&#xD;
as to say, that thing was best to do; and an undefinedIi'f&#xD;
realization of the truth, took away all desire of further infor-&#xD;
mation,-I asked not another word. And Mrs. Howard&#xD;
quietly left the lesson to Time's teaching.&#xD;
That was in the beginning of our descent-I had yet to&#xD;
get used to it. Now, on looking back, I feel as if we had&#xD;
come like a child slipping down hillkagfraid to let ourselves&#xD;
go, and catching at every bushjto stop our progress; but&#xD;
that if we had come straight to the bottom, it would ha.&#xD;
hurt us less than we imagined, and we should the sooner.&#xD;
have got breath to go up again.   or, even in temporal&#xD;
things, the valley of humiliation is fair more pleasant than&#xD;
the side-hill which leads to it. Yet I do not mean to regret&#xD;
a what. is passed,-the shock has perhaps been less--the&#xD;
wholesome discipline and experience, greater.&#xD;
Let me go back for a moment to the time when our&#xD;
began to lose ground, softly, softly,-when we laid hold of-a&#xD;
great tree that we thought would sustain us-finding too late&#xD;
that its top spread further than its roots; ere I tell how that&#xD;
tree. loosened and loosened, and finally brought us to the&#xD;

foot of the hill.-It did not fall on top of us-that was one&#xD;
eotafort,--neither strength nor hope was quite destroyed.&#xD;
"And indeed," says Bunyan of the valley, "it is a fruitful&#xD;
soil, and doth bring forth by handfuls."-&#xD;
Gently the wind swept over the snow-covered streets-;&#xD;
gently, the firelight brightened and faded, brightened and&#xD;
faded, on the ceiling of the last parlour where we sat as rich&#xD;
people; while my father was" conning one of a half dozen&#xD;
evening papers, and pencils and books occupied other&#xD;
heads and hands that were about the table. Suddenly broke&#xD;
forth the following advertisement.&#xD;
"For sale-A large property on the banks of bake Luna,&#xD;
-consisting of meadow, farm, and woodland--splendid sites&#xD;
for country-seats, unrivalled water-power, &amp;amp;c.,, &amp;amp;c., &amp;amp;c.&#xD;
The scenery and salubrity of this celebrated place cannot be&#xD;
surpassed. Roads of the greatest variety and excellence&#xD;
afford opportunity for driving and equestrian exercise; while&#xD;
pedestrians will find a never-failing source of delight in the&#xD;
romantic strolls about the neighborhood.&#xD;
"Fish and game abound in every direction ; and the near&#xD;
ity of the Honiton turnpike (one of the finest in the&#xD;
00  dy) renders it easy for gentlemen who are so disposed,&#xD;
tctttend to their business in other places.&#xD;
"The neighbourhood is eminently moral.&#xD;
" A celebrated physician has been induced, rather from&#xD;
regard to the mental than bodily wants of his friends, to&#xD;
locate in their midst; 'and although there is as yet but one&#xD;
church within ten miles, other denominations will no doubt&#xD;
find it for their advantage to share so interesting a region.&#xD;
"It is also in contemplation to erect a college in Ethan&#xD;
township.&#xD;
"The present proprietor being obliged to go to Europe,&#xD;
is desirous of curtailing his business and responsibilities in&#xD;
this country; and would dispose of the above grounds on.,&#xD;
terms that could not fail to render them a profitable pure&#xD;
chase.&#xD;
"Apply to R. H. McLoon.-Wall-st., New York."&#xD;
"Why that is the very place !" said my father.&#xD;
"uWhatraee7"&#xD;
*" WhytAe place that brother Ned is 80 anxiious to hav&#xD;

me buy-that he says could be made so productive. He&#xD;
has been writing of nothing else for the last two months."&#xD;
"And why should you buy it ?" pursued Mrs. Howard,&#xD;
with a woman's desire to know the what for-even of a&#xD;
speculation.&#xD;
"dWhy ?--O Ned says the purchase money could be&#xD;
doubled in no time--and I dare say he is right. I presume&#xD;
it would make myrtune."&#xD;
Mrs. Howard smiled-one of those smiles that are half a&#xD;
sigh-and her eye glanced. round the room. A superb coal&#xD;
fire and an equally superb Carcelle lamp, shone upon Turkey&#xD;
carpets, damask curtains and sofas, chandeliers, carved furni-&#xD;
ture, pictures, shells and statues; while between the windows&#xD;
a second fire and lamp seemed to gleam and blaze in the&#xD;
long mirror, and called forth a reflection even from the far&#xD;
end of the next room. "Make my fortune !"-&#xD;
"Well ?" said my father as the quiet eye came back from&#xD;
its survey. "Well ?---what now ?"&#xD;
"I was thinking," replied my stepmother, "of what soite&#xD;
body said to Alexander."&#xD;
"Fiddle-de-dee !" said my father, "but at that rate nobody&#xD;
would ever speculate."&#xD;
Another slight smile, a half sorrowful shake of the head,&#xD;
answered this remark, and my father seemed a little posed.&#xD;
" To be sure"-he said thoughtfully, "the place is larger&#xD;
than I.like-some thousand acres I believe,-and would need&#xD;
a good deal of attention and outlay. Well, we shall see,-.&#xD;
I will talk to Ned about it; but I always thought you would&#xD;
like a country-seat again "&#xD;

CHAPTER II.&#xD;
&#xD;
From thence the tide of fortune left the shore,&#xD;
And ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before.&#xD;
DRYDEN.&#xD;
&#xD;
T HE man who getting frightenedwhen half across a river,&#xD;
turned about and swam back, has been more laughed at&#xD;
than he deserved; for there is always at least a question of&#xD;
shores, and the remnant of that strength which will suffice to&#xD;
reach either, may be much the most available on one. It is&#xD;
jjassible to rest and recruit, where enterprise would be&#xD;
madness.&#xD;
' Had we followed this renowned example, and turned our&#xD;
backs upon Fortune when she took leave of us, we should&#xD;
have been-I don't know what-it is impossible now to say ;&#xD;
but we should not have been the possessors of Glen Luna.&#xD;
Like wise people we pushed on, and entered "the diggings"&#xD;
with neither the proper utensils nor the means and skill to&#xD;
procure and use them.&#xD;
One precautionary measure we did take-we sold our&#xD;
town house,-as soldiers burn the ships which have brought&#xD;
them where they are to-conquer or die. It was not quite&#xD;
for the same reason; but the times were changed now, in&#xD;
earnest, and as we could not keep all, of course we chose&#xD;
the new. How far this desired possession had made it&#xD;
needful to part with most things else, perhaps no one&#xD;
guessed but Mrs. Howard; nor do I now know. One thing&#xD;
was certain,-we were to leave Philadelphia, and because&#xD;
we must.&#xD;
Various were the opinions of people about us and our&#xD;
private arrangements,-and my father's regard to them was&#xD;
as steadily cool and careless. In the first place he merely&#xD;
meant to go for the summer ; and had that not been so, with&#xD;
&#xD;
the glowing visions he had in prospect Mr. Howard would&#xD;
nave said,&#xD;
"No shame to stoupe one's head, more higher to rear;&#xD;
And much to gain, a litel for to yield."&#xD;
Shame !-that found no place in my father's mind, with&#xD;
such a police as his own honour and self-respect; and if he&#xD;
had been to try his. hand at daily labour instead of a new&#xD;
speculation, he would have walked.as erect, and look people&#xD;
in the face as unshrinkingly. He had no fear of losing him-&#xD;
self, anywhere.&#xD;
Mrs. Willet declare&amp;amp; his conduct was "noble ! noble !"-&#xD;
a speech I could make nothing of, for I understood but par.&#xD;
tally the reasons of that conduct. It seemed a small piece&#xD;
of self-denial to give up one house for another ; and as my&#xD;
imagination had already supplied Glen Luna with chickens,&#xD;
cats, and flowers-..three tribes that flourish but ill in a city&#xD;
-I thought we were like to gain as many pleasures as we&#xD;
should lose. But sense and appreciation were quickened ash&#xD;
the last weeks came, and I knew them to be thglast, and&#xD;
felt them going !&#xD;
Stephanie Holbrook-a somewhat quicksilver ward of my&#xD;
father's.......was to spend our moving-time with her aunt, Mrs.&#xD;
Eustace; and as Kate had not been well, it was agreed that&#xD;
she should go too and escape the confusion. While they&#xD;
remained, nothing was stirred nor taken leave of. Yes-.&#xD;
there was one exception,-Kate and I had a farewell drive,&#xD;
and stood watching the quick'feet of our receding ponies as&#xD;
they trotted round the corner, with a feeling of sadness that&#xD;
would perhaps have been deeper, had we known how many&#xD;
a long day would pass before their successors appeared at&#xD;
Glen Luna. But. at all events these were old friends; and&#xD;
we had seen them toss their heads and kick their feet over&#xD;
the traces, till we felt well acquainted. Perhaps too, the&#xD;
young hearts felt what the young reason could not quite fol&#xD;
low out and define,--some shadowy 'if: as though other of&#xD;
our comforts were beginning to trot off in a eloudof dust.&#xD;
Certainly we both entered the house feeling very sober ; and&#xD;
I began to cling more closely to all we were to part with.&#xD;
It 1i good that we can keep our saddle-horses," Kate said&#xD;
with a half sigh,-." I should be sorry to think we should&#xD;

never mount Puck and Mopsa again. But pap      ys he&#xD;
shall make us ride a great deal, Gracie."&#xD;
I assented, with that qualifying breath of which I was&#xD;
learning the use, but the house did not regain its old look.&#xD;
Neither was there any other look to brighten it. There was&#xD;
altogether too much resolution about my father-he could&#xD;
not have come down to common intercourse, if he had had&#xD;
time. Mrs. Howard was too busy, and too anxious; and&#xD;
Kate's untutored foot tried too hard to keep step with my&#xD;
father's. Stephanie chose her own way of expressing her&#xD;
thoughts.&#xD;
"Do you suppose, Kate," she would say, "that we shall&#xD;
have any occasion for kid gloves in the backwoods ? Or&#xD;
what do you think of our speculating a little-selling all&#xD;
our laces and buying linen collars? a great many more than&#xD;
we want, but still very useful. I don't know whether Mech-&#xD;
lin and Valenciennes will be quite becoming in farmer's&#xD;
daughters."&#xD;
4'     A very decided refusal of this last title was expressed by&#xD;
Kate witlut words.&#xD;
"You may be as scornful as you please, my dear-it's&#xD;
9 true. I don't know what the women wear, but you'll not&#xD;
see a coat in that region that isn't made of baize, nor a pair&#xD;
of pantaloons of anything but velveteen."&#xD;
"I shall pot see many of them," was Kate's cool rejoinder.&#xD;
Other people however, took up the same notion; and we&#xD;
were favoured with more than one speech of warning and&#xD;
condolence; but they went for little, because, as we said, no&#xD;
one had any right to make them. Meanwhile the season&#xD;
stood not still, and by the time spring was half gone Mrs.&#xD;
Eustace came for her visiters. That was the breaking-up&#xD;
day-after it the sooner we went the better.&#xD;
It did not look like breaking up,-the April sun shone very&#xD;
fairly, and all the imprisoned birds in the street sang their&#xD;
gratitude for the imaginary freedom they enjoyed outside.&#xD;
the briclk walls; or rather that the wires which kept them&#xD;
in were 'passable to sunbeams. So were not the dark lines&#xD;
which had ranged themselves around me,-I had treasured&#xD;
up all my regrets for that day, and there was not one of.&#xD;
them wanting. From that chief one-the parting with Kate&#xD;
.-the rest seemed to stretch away in perspective. .&#xD;

I said goodbye to Stephanie and saw her get into the dari&#xD;
riige, ungoved; but when Kate ready dressed for her jour.&#xD;
ney came down stairs, and ,pausing in the hall took.one look&#xD;
.    at the drawing-room-one last survey of the things we had&#xD;
loved and the place where we had been so happy-I felt a&#xD;
degree of sorrow that surprises me even now; and when she&#xD;
slowly-turned away and passed out of the front door, I felt&#xD;
that we had quitted our home,-the after dismantling would&#xD;
be a less matter,-the crisis was passed.&#xD;
And yet it was a trial to see our beautiful rooms, where&#xD;
taste and fancy and wealth had been so effective, st ipped of&#xD;
all their adornments,-to have the associations}which like&#xD;
sprites lurked in the folds of the window curtains, perched on&#xD;
the chandeliers, and peeped at us from statues and vases&#xD;
scattered and driven away into the cold world of strangers.&#xD;
Poor little sprites !-they come round me now, once in a&#xD;
while. Even the things we were to take with us seemed to&#xD;
share the general air of confiscation-it was hard to realize&#xD;
that we were to see them again, or to believe that they could&#xD;
look the same when taken out of their rough boxes and set&#xD;
down in a new place.&#xD;
S;   Then the furniture to be sold must be examined and dis-&#xD;
played; and this latter duty fell upon me.&#xD;
How did I feel the lines of my face change, as with a child-&#xD;
ish feeling of dignity and grave as was ever bearded senator&#xD;
I obeyed my father's summons to the drawing-room, and went&#xD;
through all the myste ies of drawers and cushions and&#xD;
strings and locks,-of which Mr. Howard knew about as&#xD;
much as most men.&#xD;
These strangers were not of those who " walk as friends,"&#xD;
-they had bought our house and now wished to buy some&#xD;
of its contents,-it never seemed to occur to them that it&#xD;
was not quite the same thing as going to a cabinet-maker's.&#xD;
They thought but of their own interest-not of my sorrow;-&#xD;
nor ever dreamed that the child who knelt by the sofa and&#xD;
busied herself in untying'the strings of its chintcoyer, had&#xD;
eyes and fingers half unfitted for the task. Thee waas no&#xD;
look -towards me, n softening or hushing of their comments;&#xD;
no gentle word o smile, Perhaps it was well,-I could&#xD;
1hardly have borne them.&#xD;

ard walked up and down with an air of the most frigid&#xD;
abstraction, and the future occupants talked and canvassed&#xD;
and measured,-this they would take because it would fit,&#xD;
and that they would not take because it was old-fashioned.&#xD;
Thie' ier-glasses happened to meet their approbation; and.[&#xD;
think sometimes of those quiet mirrors hanging there still-.&#xD;
clear, bright as ever; while the little figure that danced&#xD;
before them is so changed-so altered !&#xD;
Oh how the new-comers plagued us during those succeed-&#xD;
ing days of confusion ! Not content with sending their fur-&#xD;
niture, they would come themselves,-walk through the&#xD;
house, open the room-doors and look in, until even the quiet&#xD;
Mrs. Howard threatened desperate measures. And when I,&#xD;
sometimes sick and often tired and sad, was sent upstairs&#xD;
out of the way of cold and dust; and sat there all alone,&#xD;
wearying myself for my sister; the first thing would be the&#xD;
intrusion of a bonnet and one of those chilling strange faces.&#xD;
I really thought they might have taken it out in looking at&#xD;
the furniture below. But whatever else the Barons were,&#xD;
they were no practisers of kind politeness; and the head of&#xD;
the family drove our cook to the last stage of indignant&#xD;
ridicule, by walking into the kitchen and requesting to see&#xD;
the pot-closet! "She hadn't an idea that Mr. Howard had&#xD;
ever heard of such a'thing-no more a gentleman ought!&#xD;
What had he to do with kittles but to eat what come out of&#xD;
'em ?--and as to wanting to know where they was kep"-&#xD;
words failed, and she could do nothing but laugh.&#xD;
" Prosperity gains friends, and adversity tries them."-&#xD;
The day our first carpet was taken up, a neighbour whom&#xD;
we knew very slightly sent a most cordial note of request&#xD;
that we would all 'come and stay with her till we were ready&#xD;
to leave town. It could not be done, but the kindness was&#xD;
not forgotten-is not to this day. Meantime nothing was&#xD;
heard from Mrs. Osborne round the corner, nor Mrs. Willet&#xD;
over the way,-both old friends.&#xD;
My stepmother found that she had no time for, farewell&#xD;
visits; but the day before we were to go, she sent me to say&#xD;
goodbye to a few whom age or long acquaintanceship marked&#xD;
out for such an attention. With what a strange mood I&#xD;
went my'little round, feeling neither very well nor''very&#xD;
bright; exchanging silent greetings with the pavements and&#xD;
&#xD;
familiar corners, and now and then finding my grave little&#xD;
self in a circle of well-known faces and loudly-spoken adieus&#xD;
-I suppose they were meant for that; though they had a&#xD;
kind of abstraction, a savour of curiosity or wonder or care.&#xD;
lessness, that kept them very far from my heart. At the&#xD;
end of the round I came to Mrs. Willet's large stone house;&#xD;
and after ringing the bell I stood looking up at its grey front&#xD;
-becurtained to the very attic-wondering curiously with&#xD;
myself when I should stand on those steps again. I was&#xD;
received in full divan,-for the three Miss Whets who&#xD;
would have been girls in any other house, were young ladies&#xD;
;n this, with all the rights of curls and braids and flounces;&#xD;
and this morning their toilet had even preceded their&#xD;
mother's.&#xD;
When do you leave town ?" inquired Mrs. Willet.&#xD;
"To-morrow afternoon, ma'am."&#xD;
"Well Grace my dear, can't you all come and sleep here&#xD;
to-night? we've plenty of room you know. Wouldn't it be&#xD;
a convenience ? I might have had you before, and to dinner&#xD;
and breakfast, but I didn't think of it. Won't Mrs. Howard&#xD;
come?~"&#xD;
"I don't think she can, Mrs. Willet."&#xD;
Come, I'll go and ask her myself."-&#xD;
And cutting my audience short, the lady ventured her&#xD;
turbaned head into the street; but when she had half crossed&#xD;
the space which divided the two houses, another lady went&#xD;
up our steps.&#xD;
Who is that ?" said my companion stopping short.&#xD;
. .'jy I "Mrs. s.Baron."&#xD;
" bless me, I can't go-Pm not dressed-I know her ;"&#xD;
and back ran Mrs. Willet, nor did we see or hear from her&#xD;
again.&#xD;
I have sometimes thought, that not till we are in trouble&#xD;
can we understand the force of that expression, "the salt of&#xD;
the earth."  How might one look, one word, season as it&#xD;
were whole scores that are flat and heartless. I did not fol.&#xD;
low out any such idea, nor indeed get hold of it; but the&#xD;
want was upon me as I reached the dusty and littered side-&#xD;
walk, and saw my father overseeing the loading of a cart&#xD;

cleared the sky seemed brighter. Child-like, I turned my&#xD;

drove away leaving our old servants grouped together on&#xD;

There's nought like a blink o' on&#xD;
R. NED HOWARD lived in&#xD;

those regions as "the Moon,"-whe&#xD;
horns of the lake half enclosed it, o&#xD;
settler had been learned enough to tra&#xD;

and in the Moon lived Mr. Ned H&#xD;

Mrs. Ned Howard was a very diff&#xD;

that there was an imaginary crown upon it, which she was&#xD;
afraid would tumble off.&#xD;
Neither was the lady forgotten in the minor affairs of life.&#xD;
Rear meat bordered upon hysterics-a large piece of bread&#xD;
upon disgust; and as to beginning dinner without at least a&#xD;
puree a-la-creme-Mrs. Ned would have thought it the ex-&#xD;
treme of barbarism. The currants came on table with all&#xD;
- their natural addenda of stems, leaves, and cobwebs-but&#xD;
free from the pollution of any hands save the gardener's,-&#xD;
Mrs. Ned's own fingers dipped every cherry that she eat in&#xD;
a glass of water. Indian corn was a puzzler;-but with her&#xD;
own peculiar notions about "the least of two evils," Mrs.&#xD;
Nod promptly summoned a servant to cut the grains from&#xD;
the cob, that the delicacy might be within reach of her&#xD;
fork.&#xD;
Unhappily, she had never learned to act out the common&#xD;
but expressive maxim, "Put the best foot foremost."-Yet&#xD;
there could be a most kind smile in her eye, a most friendly&#xD;
tone in her voice; but in her education the good had not&#xD;
been developed, nor the evil kept down.&#xD;
Mrs. McNamara had all her daughter's temper and pride,&#xD;
without the redeeming qualities. Her eye was cold, inquis-&#xD;
itive, or sinister, by turns. No needless toilet labour here;&#xD;
-if the grey woollen wrapper with which Mrs. McNamara&#xD;
covered her head in cold weather could have been exchanged&#xD;
for something more tidy-even for another of its own species&#xD;
--it would have been a public benefit. And in her combi-&#xD;
nation there was an ingredient far more disagreeable than&#xD;
Mrs. Ned's anomaly of sharp bluntness,-the faint shadow&#xD;
of a second face under the hood, makes the first a thing to&#xD;
look away from. Perhaps the object on earth to which she&#xD;
had most regard, was her youngest son, Victor McNamara ;&#xD;
but of him I need only say that, inheritance and education&#xD;
had unhappily combined their forces.&#xD;
"And how does the house look, Ned ?" said my father.&#xD;
a Well, very well, but you are wanted sadly. I'm sure&#xD;
Morrison lets his men stand idle one half the time."&#xD;
"I doubt whether they stand idle," said my father.&#xD;

"'No, no, my dear--not at'all,--this has nothing to do with&#xD;
the house. I am only taking off the top of a height that came&#xD;
in the way of a certain view I want."&#xD;
"But will the view be as pretty as the height ?"&#xD;
" Of course-If it isn't we can put the rocks back&#xD;
again."&#xD;
"It will be a great comfort to yourhusband to have you&#xD;
here to advise him," said Mrs. McNamara in a soft waythat&#xD;
at once gave one a caution. "Gentlemen know so little how&#xD;
to get on alone."&#xD;
lt is fortunate that nothing can be discovered where there&#xD;
is nothing to conceal. My stepmother's quiet ." Do you&#xD;
think so ?" made Mrs. McNamara settle her wrapper and&#xD;
change her ground.&#xD;
"What did you do with all your furniture ?"&#xD;
"All that we did not sell we brought with us."&#xD;
"I suppose you didn't save any of your parlour furni-&#xD;
ture ? Dear, dear, what a pity "&#xD;
"It was no very great pity to part with what we could&#xD;
not use here," said my stepmother smiling,--" and some of&#xD;
it we kept."&#xD;
Not mirrors or anything of that sort ?"&#xD;
"Of course not !" put in Mrs. Ned. "Do you think they&#xD;
have no sense&#xD;
" Why my dear I didn't know."&#xD;
" I think if you will excuse us," said my stepmother,&#xD;
" Grace and I will go to bed,-we are both tired. Iuppose&#xD;
we have the same room as last summer?"&#xD;
" No," said Mrs. Ned,--" the front room on the second&#xD;
floor."&#xD;
"rBut that is your room-I would much prefer the other."&#xD;
" No," said Mrs. Ned again,-"it makes no difference to&#xD;
me, and that one has been arranged for you."&#xD;
My stepmother hesitated a moment, and then saying good&#xD;
"Igt shem e are givinga geat deal of trouble," she said&#xD;

this room," I remarked ; but Mrs. H ward ma e no reply,&#xD;
and I went to bed and dreamed of our i' u4ljponies.&#xD;
There was a bright sun shining when  opened my eyes&#xD;
next day; and as I looked at the various objects in our room&#xD;
-the dark carved bedstead, the glass jars of West India&#xD;
snakes, (I don't think I always felt sure of their prison-walls)&#xD;
-the blue sofa, the lamp,-there came a thought of some-&#xD;
thing else that I had wanted to do or see-what was it ?&#xD;
My mind roved about for a minute, and then I had sprung&#xD;
out of bed and was peeping through the window curtains to&#xD;
get a distant first view of our new home. There it lay on&#xD;
the other side of the lake, the fresh boards showing bare and&#xD;
unhomelike in the sun; and the quiet Sunday morning in-&#xD;
vesting everything with a character that even the eye could&#xD;
perceive.  It looked pleasant, it looked peaceful ;-and&#xD;
though its appearance suggested neither chandeliers nor long&#xD;
mirrors, I turned away with only one feeling of dissatisfac-&#xD;
tion,-I could not have a nearer view till next day.&#xD;
Meanwhile the hours were sufficiently uneventful. Mrs.&#xD;
Howard was in bed all the morning with a headache ; and&#xD;
except that when I was ready for church Mrs. McNamara&#xD;
inquired, "if that was my last winter's bonnet," my presence&#xD;
excited little attention. Happily, I needed it not,-iny mind&#xD;
was full of its own fresh pleasures,-the fountain asked no&#xD;
supply from anybody's hand.  I had never been in that&#xD;
region before, though my uncle had lived there three or four&#xD;
years; but since he left Philadelphia none of us had tried&#xD;
Mrs. Ned's hospitality but my father and mother, and the&#xD;
latter only once. So everything was quite new to me-4I&#xD;
had not even made its acquaintance at second-hand; and&#xD;
first impressions came in a delightful stream.&#xD;
There never was such a walksto church-there never was&#xD;
such another church at the end of a walk,-and there I was&#xD;
not far wrong. It stood at the western extremity of the&#xD;
lake, the beautifully kept groundwork of turf running quite&#xD;
down to the still water, the boundaries set back among the&#xD;
trees so as to be invisible. No pillar reared its Corinthian&#xD;
capital there,-the rough hewn stone, the unpretending, sub.-&#xD;
stantial architecture, gave to the little church an air of truth&#xD;
and frankness that was very pleasing ; and echoes caught&#xD;
each stroke of the bell, and gave them back with faint and&#xD;

fainter music. I came home in a sort of ecstasy, and assured&#xD;
my stepmother as she sat in the easy-chair by the fire, that&#xD;
it was "the very loveliest place anybody had ever lived in."&#xD;
"And it cannot be so very lonely, mamma," I added,&#xD;
"for even on the side where our house is I saw smoke com-&#xD;
ing out of the woods in several places. Now mamma, you&#xD;
need not smile-don't you remember how Mrs. Osborne&#xD;
talked about there being nobody here ?"&#xD;
"I shall have no fears for your happiness Gracie, when,&#xD;
we are once settled."&#xD;
" O I should be very happy to-day-if it was only to-&#xD;
morrow."&#xD;
I thought myself so as it was, when afternoon brought&#xD;
me another walk ; and in the few minutes before and after.&#xD;
service I tried to see something of the congregation, and to&#xD;
decide over which of the assembled heads that smoke was&#xD;
in the habit of curling ; but most probably I chose the wrong&#xD;
ones.&#xD;
Monday morning brought a disappointment.&#xD;
"You will not think of going to Glen Luna yourself?"&#xD;
said Mrs. Ned. as she drew on the brown gloves after break-&#xD;
fast.&#xD;
" Certainly," replied my stepmother,-".I am going at&#xD;
once. But I think I shall not take Grace-the weather looks&#xD;
threatening."&#xD;
"I did not suppose you dreamed of taking her," said&#xD;
Mrs. Ned,-" such a child is only in one's way and in dan-&#xD;
ger of getting sick. I think you are very unwise to go&#xD;
yourself."&#xD;
" Dear me! to be sure!" said Mrs. McNamara with a&#xD;
voice that made me wonder what concern of hers it could&#xD;

"Indeed I am never in mamma's way," I interposed. But&#xD;
a few drops of rain settled the question, and sorrowfully&#xD;
enough I watched Mr. and Mrs. Howard drive away.&#xD;
0 the weariness of being left alone ! especially where one&#xD;
does not want to be.&#xD;
It did not rain after all, and Mrs. Ned and Mrs. McNamara&#xD;
went out for their usual daily walk in the garden.' Perhaps&#xD;
they feared I might follow them, for at the foot of the steps&#xD;
Mrs. Ned paused, and called out,&#xD;

"Victor ! take Grace and show her the beauties of the&#xD;
~orchard."&#xD;
Nobody wanted me.--Victor, who had grown to that un-&#xD;
comfortable age which is neither one thing nor the other,&#xD;
escorted me a little way into the orchard, showed me two&#xD;
dead pigs which lay in the road, and then went off to his own&#xD;
pursuits. And I, knowing better than to go after the ladies,&#xD;
re-entered the house, and sent longing glances .to those new&#xD;
clap-boards which seemed the pleasantest thing in sight.&#xD;
Now among the peculiarities of Mrs. Ned and her mother&#xD;
was an insane desire to keep cool--not within but without,&#xD;
it Was their idiosyncrasy. At that chill time of year when a&#xD;
fire is wanted almost as much as in winter, there was none&#xD;
to be seen; unless possibly three sticks at night and two in&#xD;
tL~e morning. Also the windows were opened immediately&#xD;
after breakfast, and not shut again until--I hardly knw&#xD;
when. The rules of the house were a very slight lunch and,&#xD;
a very late dinner. I went upstairs with no inward or out-&#xD;
ward defence against the cold, and between that and hunger&#xD;
was fairly driven into dreamland, and slept a good part of&#xD;
the morning.&#xD;
It would be hard to describe my satisfaction one evening,&#xD;
when the weather being cooler than usual or Mrs. Ned more&#xD;
sensitive, she really wanted a fire--aid a fire could not be&#xD;
had. There was no wood sawn, and'the saw was broken,&#xD;
and nobody to mend it; and the way she shivered and&#xD;
warmed her hands over the chafingdish comforted me for&#xD;
a week's freezing.&#xD;
Three days did Mrs. Howard go and come without me-&#xD;
ravishing my ears every night with accounts of chickens and&#xD;
garden;--on the fourth I was again left behind but with a&#xD;
promise that I should follow her at midday with Mr. Ned.&#xD;
With what joy did I set out ! with what concentrated&#xD;
senses did I take note of everything ! how little justice I gave&#xD;
the speed of my uncle's good horses. It was a long drive,&#xD;
for beyond the church the. road swept back from the lake,&#xD;
and made quite a circuit before it approached Glen Luna,.&#xD;
I wished myself on foot that I might take one of the tanta-&#xD;
lizing little paths which promised a shorter route;- but as my&#xD;
uncle said, it would be all the same when we had once got&#xD;
there,---and it was.&#xD;
&#xD;
The house itself was not only upside down with erpen&#xD;
ters and masons, plasterers and painters, but literally "turn-&#xD;
ed out of the windows ;" for boxes of furniture were stand.&#xD;
ing about the lawn in- all directions. A child's magnifying-&#xD;
glass has no lens for troubles. What did I care for the&#xD;
blasting in one direction, the scraper and oxen in another;&#xD;
the boards, the nails, the utter aid hopeless confusion every-&#xD;
where ?---they were all hidden, at least from my mind's eye,&#xD;
by a brood of little soft downy chickens that called a barrel&#xD;
their home, and a most benign-looking old hen their mother.&#xD;
So I watched them, brought chips to the little kitchen which&#xD;
looked like one of our town pantries, examined my new&#xD;
garden tools, clambered up and jumped down the front door&#xD;
step-it was then full three feet from the ground,-and&#xD;
finglly went upstairs and seated myself in the midst of&#xD;
baskets and jars and bundles, to lunch. I had been offered&#xD;
something to eat before I left the Moon, but preferred to&#xD;
reserve my appetite for home stores; and with a good will&#xD;
I now brought it to bear upon bread and butter and rasp-&#xD;
berry jam.&#xD;
Luncheon over, Mr. Ned proposed that I should go home&#xD;
with him, but my mind was made up to the contrary. So&#xD;
he departed alone, Mrs. Howard returned to her labours and&#xD;
I to mine; and surely I wore rose-coloured spectacles that&#xD;
day, if ever child did. Indeed I careered about rather too&#xD;
much for Mrs. Howard's comfort, for while I was quietly&#xD;
digging up flowers at the edge of the woods, or walking&#xD;
round some rock or knoll to see what was on the other side,&#xD;
she would get quite frightened about me.&#xD;
Towards evening my uncle sent a boat for us, as being the&#xD;
quickest and least fatiguing way of getting back ; and after&#xD;
a last feeding of chickens and locking of doors, we set out to&#xD;
cross the lake. It was near dark but very quiet, and the&#xD;
dip of the oars was as good as a lullaby. Gently my spirits&#xD;
subsided, and I came back to the every-day world.&#xD;
"How very good dinner will taste !" said I.&#xD;
"Yes," said Mrs. Howard,"I begin to feel qite hungry."&#xD;
"You had better curb both appetite and expectation,"&#xD;
said my father,-" it is long past dinner-time."&#xD;
" But papa ! they must have saved us some,-for they knew&#xD;
we should be very hungry."&#xD;

"Hum"-said Mr. Howard as the gat struck the shore,&#xD;
--" wefI-must is a strong word no doubt, but you are wel-&#xD;
come to my share of the dinner, Gracie."&#xD;
My stepmother and I went directly upstairs, and having&#xD;
made ourselves presentable we descended to the parlour&#xD;
with our hopes somewhat cooled by my father's remarks.&#xD;
He had reason.&#xD;
The tea-table was set with wafers of bread and butter and&#xD;
fractions of toast, but dinner might have been an obsolete&#xD;
meal for all that appeared to the contrary. We took our&#xD;
seats without a word.&#xD;
"Harriet," said my uncle taking a survey of the plates&#xD;
before'him, "didn't you save some dinner for these peo-&#xD;
ple ?"&#xD;
"Certainly not Mr. Howard-I thought they knew our&#xD;
dinner-hour."&#xD;
" But when people are cleaning house they can't be tied&#xD;
down to a minute."&#xD;
"I could not r possibly tell when they would come," re-&#xD;
plied Mrs. Ned, her face flushing and the imaginary crown&#xD;
in unusual danger ;-" and as to waiting dinner it would&#xD;
have been absurd-I did not know but they would choose&#xD;
to dine on the other side."&#xD;
"Choose to dine on chips and mortar !"'said my uncle&#xD;
with a mixture of laugh and vexation. "Is there nothing left&#xD;
from dinner ?"&#xD;
"I really cannot tell, Mr. Howard," said Mrs. Ned get-&#xD;
ting up and ringing the bell with great energy,-" how should&#xD;
1 know what was left from dinner ? Charles," she added as&#xD;
the waiter came in, "just go down stairs and bring up any.&#xD;
cold meat and vegetables that you can find."&#xD;
"And tell Violet to warm them first," said my uncle.&#xD;
There was a moment's pause, and then my stepmother&#xD;
entered her protest,-in vain.&#xD;
" Certainly we could have dinner," Mrs. Ned replied-"'if&#xD;
there was any,"-so we half waited and half went on eating,&#xD;
till the arriggpl of some boiled fish re-warmed, brown un-&#xD;
comfortableooking potatoes, and beets.&#xD;
By this time Mrs. Ned recollected herself and did the&#xD;
honours of the Cod as well as might be; but we had eaten&#xD;
so many of the decimal fractions, and had heard so much&#xD;
&#xD;
conversation, that the reinforcement was little heeded except&#xD;
by my father,-who gaLhis dinner very unconcernedly.&#xD;
Three weeks passed thus. Every day we went to the&#xD;
Glen, but having been taught our lesson we took care always&#xD;
to return by dinner-time. Every day I made some new&#xD;
discovery,-a strange wild-flower-a nice chicken-coop in&#xD;
place of the barrel-a moss pincushion of peculiar luxuriance,&#xD;
or a rock that had some extraordinary advantages as a table&#xD;
or a lookout. But Mrs. Howard grew very tired of the&#xD;
punctual-dinner system, and found it most inconvenient to be&#xD;
so far from the scene of action ; and at last she resolved to&#xD;
take possession of our house before it was quite ready for&#xD;
us, and let Mrs. Ned have her own room again. So we&#xD;
removed.&#xD;
It was near the gloaminst, when we took our first meal at&#xD;
Glen Luna,-we three. The two older ones thinking grave-&#xD;
ly of ways and means, prospects and probabilities,-the&#xD;
younger with "eyes brimful of delight," and a mood that&#xD;
thought herrings and bread and butter the very best things&#xD;
that ever were eaten.&#xD;
And a whip-poor-will who knew not of our coming, sat on&#xD;
a tree close by the house, and sang-as he thought, to him-&#xD;
self-but to us it seemed a strange, wild welcome. We&#xD;
could not translate his plaintive notes, yet not one of the&#xD;
listeners but felt an echo of that trill,-as wild, as untrais-&#xD;
latable.&#xD;
And we were fairly established in our new home ;-and&#xD;
one of the number at least, had very bright hopes and fore-&#xD;
bodings-an undefined expectation of everything pleasant.&#xD;

CHAPTER IV.&#xD;
Our youth! our childhood! that spring of'springs!t&#xD;
Tis surely one of the blessedest things&#xD;
That nature ever invented!&#xD;
When the rich are wealthy, beyond their wealth,&#xD;
And the poor are rich in spirits and health,&#xD;
And all with their lots contented!&#xD;
HOOD.&#xD;
IJUWE were awaked next morning by a perfect concert of&#xD;
cat birds and song spari'ows,-waked to see the sun&#xD;
rise on our new habitation, and our untried country life.&#xD;
Who does not remember some first awaking in a strange&#xD;
place ?-the quiet lying still as the eye takes in unwonted&#xD;
walls and windows that are bright with the old familiar sun-&#xD;
Iight,-the gradual gathering up of the stray ends of remem-&#xD;
brance-the where, the how, and the whence,--and then the&#xD;
sudden spring of both mind and body at the thought of the&#xD;
new and unproved things that await one below stairs.&#xD;
I remember it all, though now what my waking eyes first&#xD;
rest upon has been so often seen in every variety of early&#xD;
light, that I can hardly realize its having ever looked strange&#xD;
to me ;-as hardly as that the cat birds which have sung at&#xD;
my matinees this summer, were then unheard of in the musi-&#xD;
cal world : or by some remote possibility of long life, were&#xD;
on that very morning hiding their undeveloped feathers and&#xD;
faculties together, beneath a blue egg-shell. So have we&#xD;
both emerged !-they from the nest, I front the child's mist&#xD;
which was pervious to nothing but sunshine.&#xD;
Uncle Ned was at the door by the time we had break-&#xD;
fasted; ardi after some words of greeting and advice, and a&#xD;
long message from Mrs. Ned and Mrs. McNamara about&#xD;
our health and happiness, he and I set forth on a walk. All&#xD;
neW to me,-all glittering with fresh dew-drops!&#xD;

My uncle was in his element, and talked almost as fast as&#xD;
I did. Now he led the way through a little thicket of young&#xD;
trees, charging me to tell my father that there was the place&#xD;
to transplant from; now he pointed out some fair little&#xD;
flower and told of his success or failure when he had tried to&#xD;
inure it to his garden. It was in that walk I first saw&#xD;
the moccasin flower, or rather its bud, for they were not&#xD;
near their full size and had scarce begun to -show colour.&#xD;
But we dug them up-vain experiment ! and Mr. Ned told&#xD;
of yellow ones that he had found; and then I hoped that&#xD;
every green bud a little paler than usual belonged to the&#xD;
yellow species. We found too the fair pink azalea,-the&#xD;
shadblossom-with more literal but less spiritual fairness;-&#xD;
and mosses and ferns, and little nameless white flowers that&#xD;
to this day I know only by sight.&#xD;
There is nothing left of t-iat walk but the remembrance.&#xD;
The child and the man have both passed away :-the slight&#xD;
flower has raised up its head and shaken out its full petals,&#xD;
-the stronger plant has withered and been cut down.&#xD;
We came back in a great heat, for the sun had got the&#xD;
vantage-ground and was pouring down his beams with as&#xD;
perfect unconcern as if we had been pine-apples. Mr. Ned&#xD;
threw himself on the ground in the shade, while I went off&#xD;
to dispose of my spoils. Presently I heard,&#xD;
"Grace, Grace !- here's a new flower for you !" I ran, but&#xD;
all I could see at first was my uncle, still on the grass and&#xD;
laughing very contentedly,-then.I espied the object of his&#xD;
contemplation in a slow-moving mud-turtle. I don't know&#xD;
why we laughed-unless our spirits were just waiting for a&#xD;
chance, but the mud-turtle had some reason to turn about&#xD;
and laugh at us.&#xD;
"Now run," said my uncle, " and see if we are to have any&#xD;
luncheon, for I must be going home."&#xD;
"Where's mamma, Caddie ?" I called out as I approached&#xD;
the house.&#xD;
"Sure I don't know, Miss, but she's got company."&#xD;
"Company !" I hesitated, but curiosity carried it over&#xD;
timidity and I marched on.&#xD;
"Yes ma'am," was the first thing I heard as I entered,&#xD;
"do you think you will like it here, Mrs. Howard ? yes, I&#xD;
do hope so indeed-I shall be so glad,-yes maa.&#xD;

My stepmother was in the kitchen, cap on head and broom&#xD;
in hand, and opposite to her stood a lady who looked as if&#xD;
house-cleaning and moving had formed no chapter of her ex-&#xD;
istence. Not very tall nor very large, rather delicately&#xD;
formed indeed,-her morning dress spotless, a nice little&#xD;
parasol in her hand; while on her head the very pink of pink&#xD;
handkerchiefs selfdenyingly received the dust wherewith our&#xD;
atmosphere was loaded.&#xD;
"1And this is one of your daughters, yes," said the lady as&#xD;
she caught sight of me,-" the oldest I suppose, yes ma'am.&#xD;
How old is the youngest ?"&#xD;
"This is the youngest," replied my stepmother.&#xD;
"The youngest? but my dear Mrs. Howard you surprise&#xD;
me indeed, yes. I hope they will come and see me very&#xD;
often, yes ma'am. And won't you let one of them go home&#xD;
with me and stay till you get settled ?-or both of them,-&#xD;
yes ma'am, it would give me so much pleasure."&#xD;
" There is only this one at home now," said my stepmother&#xD;
smiling, and I think she could hardly be prevailed on. to leave&#xD;
me without her important assistance. But we are very,&#xD;
much obliged to you for such a kind offer, Miss Caffery, and&#xD;
for coming to see us in all this dust and confusion."&#xD;
"Dust?" said Miss Caffery,-" 0 I have seen dust before,&#xD;
ma'am-yes very often; and I can always breathe where my&#xD;
friends can. Not obliged at all-it would be only a pleasure&#xD;
to me, yes. But I wish you could come out of it for a while."&#xD;
"I will come and see you as soon as Iam out of it," said.&#xD;
Mrs. Howard, "you may be sure of that."&#xD;
"Yes ma'am, pray do. And do send to me if I can be of&#xD;
any use,-I should be so glad to help you; yes ma'am, I&#xD;
should indeed."&#xD;
And the pink handkerchief departed, somewhat the worse&#xD;
I fear for its sojourn in our kitchen, and we saw it passing&#xD;
along the walk till it reached the woods and was hidden&#xD;
like a rose in the green foliage. Then Mrs. Howard and I&#xD;
looked at each other and laughed-at least I did-heartily;&#xD;
but my stepmother soon checked herself and then me.&#xD;
Come," she said, "you must not let your amusement&#xD;
change into ridicule,-Miss Caffery is by no means a subject&#xD;
for it."&#xD;
"Who is Miss Caffery ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"One of our neighbours."&#xD;
" One of our neighbours! I didn't know we had any.'&#xD;
"Have you forgotten the smoke that came out of the&#xD;
woods in two or three places ?" said Mrs. Howard smiling.&#xD;
" No, but mamma you laughed at that, so I thought maybe&#xD;
it was nothing after all. Where does Miss Caffery live?"&#xD;
"Some distance below us, on the lake ; but I don't think&#xD;
you have seen her house-it is almost hidden by trees."&#xD;
"But what is she ?"&#xD;
" She is a lady."&#xD;
"-Dear mamma, I know that ! I mean who 'is she, and&#xD;
what does she do, and who does she live with ?"&#xD;
"She is Miss Easy Caffery, for your first question; and&#xD;
for the second, I shall know better what she does when I&#xD;
have seen more of her. She lives with her cousin, Miss&#xD;
Avarintha Bain-or rather Miss Bain lives with her,"&#xD;
." Alone ?"&#xD;
" Alone in the parlour,-I presume they have servants in&#xD;
the kitchen."&#xD;
" Well they have got a pair of names between them !" I&#xD;
remarked. "But mamma, have we any more neighbours ?"&#xD;
"I think it is probable, but Gracie run and call your&#xD;
father and uncle to lunch. If they had not been more for-&#xD;
earing than your chickens we should have been deafened&#xD;
y this time, and they would have been hoarse-which un-&#xD;
appily, chickens never are.&#xD;
This was our last day of fine weather. We had first a&#xD;
long quaker storm, and then a long storm of some other&#xD;
kind and of most unquakerlike vehemence, with'only a day's&#xD;
sunshine between. Rain, rain,-the potatoes washed out of&#xD;
.          the ground and I kept close prisoner in the house. ,.Now&#xD;
there was literally not one habitable apartment. The bed..&#xD;
room walls were so damp that the windows were dripping&#xD;
with water, every morning when we-got up,-(Mrs. McNa-&#xD;
mnYta could'not imagine why we were not sick); and though&#xD;
wemanaged to get three dusted chairs and a fire when&#xD;
ever     ne; by day.both parlour and kitchen were a&#xD;
compound-of paint and plaster-streams of cold air and of&#xD;
tsoasuds. If I had but been a mason or a cleaner all would&#xD;

them was not pleasant;' and danger as well as discomfort&#xD;
came hand in hand with the damp air from without. As a&#xD;
last resort I betook myself to the garret, and reigned queen&#xD;
of the new floor and the old lumber. It was a dear-bought&#xD;
eminence. There I sat, hour after hour and day after day,&#xD;
with nothing to do, with no one to speak to: sometimes&#xD;
watching the carpenter bees, who thought our rafters were&#xD;
laid for their express accommodation,-sometimes looking&#xD;
over at the misty Moon across the lake; and then wonder-&#xD;
ing wearily what Kate was doing, and whether she wanted&#xD;
me as I wanted her. I wonder at myself now for those long&#xD;
lonely days.&#xD;
I had besought our whitewasher to get me a cat, but the&#xD;
cat was long in coming,-still the -mere hope was good, as&#xD;
far as it went. Now and then when I got very tired I&#xD;
clambered down the steep ladder-like steps, and wrapping&#xD;
myself up, went and stood by the painter to watch his up-&#xD;
strokes and down-strokes.&#xD;
Then when the weather held up a little I would run out&#xD;
to see my chickens ; but the poor things with their half-&#xD;
grown wings drooping to the ground, looked as desolate as&#xD;
I was ; and their shrill piercing "peep ! peep !" rang in my&#xD;
ears for an hour after, and gave me the heartache.&#xD;
At length I bethought me of overhauling some of the&#xD;
boxes that encumbered my dominions,-it would be em-&#xD;
ployment if nothing more ; and dragging one out to front the&#xD;
window,:I set to work. The amount of will in my finger-&#xD;
ends supplied the place of strength; and as the fastenings&#xD;
were also wanting in that last particular, the box-not&#xD;
exactly flew open-but was with some hard work forced to&#xD;
reveal its contents. They were numerous-odds and ends&#xD;
of all sorts; but among them I did find one little volume-a&#xD;
prayer-book. It may be questioned whether prayer-book&#xD;
was ever so devoured. Not the service part-I cared little&#xD;
for that-but the hymns,-they gave me something to do ;&#xD;
and many a one I learned in those solitary days in-the.gar. P&#xD;
ret. This held me some time, and then I had another search&#xD;
which produced Mrs. Sherwood's " Roxobel." TIye intensity&#xD;
of delight and appreciation with which I read it cannot be'&#xD;
told.&#xD;
.I was poring over my little red volume one morning,&#xD;
&#xD;
when I heard 'my name called. Down stairs I went, even&#xD;
to the kitchen, and there stood Mrs. Howard holding in her&#xD;
arms a little grey and white kitten. I should despair of&#xD;
making anybody who had never felt the like, understand how&#xD;
glad I was. My frock was immediately outstretched to re-&#xD;
ceive her, and I carried off my new companion with a charge&#xD;
from Mrs. Howard "not to spoil the cat." To which I&#xD;
replied,&#xD;
"Ah but she has just come&#xD;
And with this universal reason fpr spoiling-whether&#xD;
cats or children-I was 'quite satisfied, and petted my kitty&#xD;
to her heart's content and mine. I was alone no longer;&#xD;
and to do the little thing justice, she seemed to think almost&#xD;
as much of my playmate qualifications as I thought of hers.&#xD;
I might have quoted Montaigne. "Who knows whether&#xD;
puss is not more amused with me than I am with puss ?"-&#xD;
It was my delight to run dancing towards her, and then. to&#xD;
see the raised back and sidelong jump as with outstretched&#xD;
paws she darted to catch my foot. A couple of kittens,&#xD;
kind reader ! I fear you think them scarce worth writing&#xD;
about: yet many a time did Mr. and Mrs. Howard stand&#xD;
with pleased eyes and relaxed muscles to watch our gambols&#xD;
on the gravel-walk which was now laid in front of the house.&#xD;
We were taking a walk one day-I and my little cat;&#xD;
and puss was quietly. sleeping in my arms, except when&#xD;
some misstep of mine giving her a slight jar she would purr&#xD;
a sleepy little acknowledgement; and wandering,  I came&#xD;
at last to the western boundary of our premises,-i1his.&#xD;
direction not very far from the house. The fence did iit&#xD;
divide us from the turnpike, but from the grounds of our&#xD;
next neighbour, Mr. Collingwood. Formerly he had owned&#xD;
our glen, and then a farm road had come through without&#xD;
interruption,-now, where I stood, a barplace cut it in two,&#xD;
and on either hand stretched away the young thorn hedge&#xD;
and its guardian fence. I stood a long time looking over.&#xD;
The road went naturally on, though now the tracks were&#xD;
almost overgrown, and a4 a little distance from me took a&#xD;
short turn to the right behind the woods. Woods hemmed&#xD;
it i, n the left also; but jnst beyond the turn there was an&#xD;
ope      rough which I could see a field of spring grain, then&#xD;

sunk towards the lake-a gleam of its bright waters. The&#xD;
spring air brought almost as sweet ideas as. odours.; and&#xD;
two phoebe birds were telling each other just what [-felt.&#xD;
I had a longing desire to pass on, and to sit in the shade&#xD;
of a beautiful cedar that was drooping over the road. I tried&#xD;
the bars-they were fast, or too heavy for me to move. No&#xD;
matter; I could climb well enough; so putting down my&#xD;
sleepy qat that she might run under I went over, took up&#xD;
puss and sat down beneath the cedar tree. I know not how&#xD;
lng I had been there, but I was lost in the attempt to&#xD;
find out how phoebe No. 1 could understand phoebe fNo. 2,&#xD;
when I heard a loud impatient bark; and as a great dog&#xD;
dashed out of the woods, kitty sprang from my arms with a&#xD;
farewell scratch, and up into the tree.&#xD;
Here was a situation!&#xD;
I was somewhat afraid of the dog, and still more for the&#xD;
gat ; so backing up against the tree I alternated between&#xD;
"poor kitty !" and "go away sir !"-while the dog threw his&#xD;
head back, and barked at the limb of the tree with his whole&#xD;
heart.&#xD;
Then in a moment a voice, had called the dog off and&#xD;
ordered him home, and the owner of the voice had walked&#xD;
up to me.&#xD;
I believe I looked at him as if he might have been a party&#xD;
to the onset, but a pleasant smile reassured me ; and I&#xD;
pointed out the only visible white paw of my little com-&#xD;
patnion where she lay hid, far out of'my reach, and asked if&#xD;
hewould not keep the dog away till my kitten came down.&#xD;
The danger had frightened me out ony usual shyness.&#xD;
"The dog will not come back," said the gentleman; and'&#xD;
reaching up his hand he disengaged the cat-after some&#xD;
efforts and though she spit at him vigorously-and deposited&#xD;
her in my apron.&#xD;
"I am very sorry my dog has frightened you," he said-.&#xD;
"does this little cat belong to Miss Howard "&#xD;
"No sir."&#xD;
" No ?"&#xD;
"NIt belongs to me sir."&#xD;
"But me is very indefinite," said the gentleman smiling.&#xD;

"Yes sir, I do live there-at least I am going to ;-but I&#xD;
am not Miss Howard, I am only Grace."&#xD;
"And why not Miss Howard ?"&#xD;
"Because my sister is not married yet."&#xD;
The gentleman laughed, and then as we walked along to&#xD;
the bar-place he said,&#xD;
" I hope this little feline of yours will not be the worse for&#xD;
her fright."&#xD;
"No sir, but-that isn't her name."&#xD;
"Are you quite sureA?"&#xD;
"Yes sir,-at least never gave it to her. Do you think&#xD;
it is a pretty one ?"&#xD;
He laughed again.-&#xD;
"I see I must call things by their right names," he said.&#xD;
"Well, when you know latin you may call your cat felina,&#xD;
-at present I would recommend Muff or Tippet.; and now&#xD;
shall I put you both over the fence together ?-or stay, I can&#xD;
let down these bars."&#xD;
His strength readily accomplished this, and with a very&#xD;
pleasant farewell we parted.&#xD;
"I am very much obliged to you, sir !" I said, turning&#xD;
round again with the little cat in my arms just as the last bar&#xD;
was replaced.&#xD;
The gentleman rested both hands on the topmost one, and&#xD;
smilingly inquired,&#xD;
"For what 2"&#xD;
"For getting kitty down from the tree."&#xD;
"That was rather an act of justice to kitty than of favour&#xD;
to you, Miss Grace. I was bound to repair the mischief I&#xD;
had occasioned."&#xD;
"But it was the dog's mischief."&#xD;
" I am afraid the dog's mischief will always be visited&#xD;
upon me-he is not a responsible person."&#xD;
" Well I thank you very much sir,-and for letting down&#xD;
the bars for me, too."&#xD;

Be that will have a cake out of the wheat, must needs tarry the grinding.&#xD;
SLIAKSPEARE-.&#xD;
'"rDO wish I could do something to-morrow," said I.&#xD;
S" Do something to-morrow !" said my uncle Ned.&#xD;
"And what ails to-morrow that it should have something&#xD;
done on it, of all days in the year ?"&#xD;
"Because papa is going to Kellerton to-day, and Kate and&#xD;
Stephanie will come home with him to-morrow ;--and I do&#xD;
so want to make a fuss.".&#xD;
"There will be fuss enough, I'll warrant you," said my&#xD;
father. . If you would prepare an anodyne to be admuiis-&#xD;
red as soon as they get here, there'd be some sense in it,&#xD;
"There wouldn't be-much fun, papa,-and I haven't-seen&#xD;
Kate in so long-and one can't have bonfires by daylight."&#xD;
"Why don't you put up a flag ?" said my stepmother.&#xD;
A flag !-so Imight ! that would be the very thing.&#xD;
But then I don't know. where to put it-and papa will be&#xD;
away."--~&#xD;
"And I will come and do it for you," said my uncle.&#xD;
"Will you really ? 0 I should be so very glad. But&#xD;
where shall we put 'it ? and where can' I get a flag ?-.-OI&#xD;
know !---those red curtains would be splendid !",&#xD;
'"No indeed," said my uncle,--"I have no notion of hoist.&#xD;
in Captain Kidd's.colours at Glen Luna.".&#xD;
"And besides," said Mrs. Howard, "the red curtains are&#xD;
Apo heavy to fly well, and much too good to be let fly at all.&#xD;
But there are some white muslin curtains, Grace, that you&#xD;
may sew together if you like."'&#xD;
" Well---thank you mamma-.-only I'm afraid they won't&#xD;
shew much."&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLLARS AND CENTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
p*&#xD;
&#xD;
"Couldn't anything shew better," said Mr. Ned. "You&#xD;
sew them up, and we will raise the flag on that high bluff&#xD;
that looks down the Honiton turnpike,--the white muslin&#xD;
will make a great appearance against the green woods."&#xD;
"And then papa," I said anxiously, "you will be sure not&#xD;
to forget to make them look for it ?"&#xD;
"Suppose they are riding backwards ?" said my father.&#xD;
"Now papa !-you know they won't be--you mustn't&#xD;
let them. I should be so disappointed if they didn't see my&#xD;
flag after all."&#xD;
"That shall not be, dear, if I can help it," he answered,&#xD;
with a smile,-"if they can't see out of the window I'll put'*&#xD;
them on the'roof, and if they are. asleep I'll wake them up;&#xD;
--so make your little heart easy."&#xD;
The white curtains were upon my mind when I awoke&#xD;
next morning-indeed I might say that everything else in&#xD;
my mind was curiously wrapped up in them; so that I could&#xD;
hardly get at an idea of any sort, except through the medium&#xD;
.of their white folds.&#xD;
It was the fourth of June,-early summer in reality,&#xD;
while in effect it was yet spring ; for the season had been&#xD;
very late; but now it was pushing its way with a verylovely&#xD;
and quiet working. The bright sheen of the late ram was upon&#xD;
everything ; the trees in a perfect hurry to get their leaves.&#xD;
out,-it seemed as if they had grown inches since yesterday, &#xD;
and our plan could not have had finer weather.&#xD;
. With needle and thread we transformed two curtains into&#xD;
one big flag, fastened it to the top of a pole, and then Mr.&#xD;
Ned and I set off for the Brown bluff with an Irish boy for&#xD;
standard-bearer. There was no regular path-or we missed&#xD;
it--and many a delusive opening in the woods, many a&#xD;
promising little hill, lured us on to new disappointments. If&#xD;
my will had not, been stronger than my feet I should hardly&#xD;
have reached the bluff at all; but once there, the rest was&#xD;
easy. We chose the most promising tree, and then Andy.&#xD;
squirrelized to the top, and receiving the pole from my uncle&#xD;
lashed it to the upper branches,--with so many knots aid&#xD;
twistings that the future unfastening thereof seemedgrob-&#xD;
lematical.&#xD;
. And away went the white folds of our flag of truce&#xD;
hanging lazily for a moment among the pine. boughs, ~u&#xD;

then rousing themselves and stretching off upon the sweetest&#xD;
possible north wind. If we had foreseen what was before us,&#xD;
we could have shewn no more appropriate colours on our&#xD;
first settling at Glen Luna.&#xD;
We watched the flag for a little, speculating upon the&#xD;
probable distance to which it could be seen, and theiarned&#xD;
homeward. The moccasin flowers were fully out now, and&#xD;
In beautiful variety. Some very tall and of the most delicate&#xD;
pink, while in others the rich depth of colour seemed to&#xD;
compensate for a lower growth. My hand was never ruth.&#xD;
less in the matter of picking, but I could hardly pass by such&#xD;
beauties; and with some late anemonies, an early wild lily,&#xD;
and eorydalis flowers, I soon had enough to dress a vase&#xD;
to put in Kate's room.&#xD;
flowweary I was then!-with having done so much and&#xD;
with having no more to do. Weary of waiting for the stage.-&#xD;
horn which I thought would never blow ; and then fluttered&#xD;
and excited when I heard the feint sound in the distance, and&#xD;
stood watching for the first glimpse of the carriage. We&#xD;
had an April meeting, all round ; but the rest of the day was&#xD;
clear sunshine. I remember that we found the first ripe&#xD;
s4r'berry and the first wild violet that afternoon: that we&#xD;
told      thing and showed everything, and yet could not&#xD;
Stisfed with telling and showing ;--that we settled down&#xD;
being very quiet and happy, despite bare floors and&#xD;
sion. Kate had seen the flag miles away, and had re-&#xD;
all the messages that I sent my absent sister through&#xD;
white folds.&#xD;
"And how do you like the looks of things, Katie ?" said&#xD;
my father 'next morning at breakfast.&#xD;
4"The place is lovely, papa."&#xD;
"And what isn't lovely ?"&#xD;
"Why nothing, I suppose," said Kate rather dubio sl..&#xD;
onlyI was thinking of what Mrs. Osborne said, 'that no&#xD;
body lived here.'n&#xD;
"Mrs. Osborne said that, did she ?  Well, if I am as wise&#xD;
for a man as she is for a woman, I make no  ubt we shall&#xD;

" sriously Mr. Howard," said Stephanie, "are we to&#xD;

"Unclk Ned does not think very much of his neighbours,"&#xD;
said Kate;"and who are ours, papa? what do you mean by&#xD;
'plenty'1?"&#xD;
"Plenty, my dear, is defined by Johnson to be 'such a&#xD;
quantity as is more than enough'."&#xD;
"But what do you call enough neighbours ?" said Ste.&#xD;
phanie.&#xD;
" Depends entirely on the kind"-replied Mr. Howard.&#xD;
" If the kind were Mrs. Osborne I should call herself&#xD;
'plenty.&#xD;
" Ah papa! you are too bad. Who is there here that we&#xD;
shall be apt to see"&#xD;
"Why there's your old friend Mrs. De Camp, and our&#xD;
new friend Miss Caffery, and there is Mr. Collingwood'a&#xD;
family."&#xD;
" Mr. Collingwood is only a farmer," said Kate.&#xD;
"And if he were a fair type. of the class, it would be well&#xD;
if all the world were 'only farmers'.- I am thankful Os-&#xD;
bornes don't grow in the country !-Then my dear when I&#xD;
get my stone cottages built, you know we can sell them to&#xD;
whom we please; and for the present we are at least in a&#xD;
wholesome atmosphere."&#xD;
"Stone cottages !" cried Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
"Why yes," said my father.-" Ned thinks and so doI&#xD;
that there is more land here than I want myself; and I talk&#xD;
of putting up a few cottages to sell or let"&#xD;
"Aid how much would it cost?"&#xD;
"0 I don't know exactly-not much,-there's abundance&#xD;
of fine stone on the spot,-they would pay for themselves in&#xD;
no time."&#xD;
"I don't believe it," said Mrs. Howard,-" you'll just lay&#xD;
the foundations with dollars and there it will end-unless&#xD;
you are ruined by the means."&#xD;

finer. I will go now and get some pieces of it before I for..&#xD;

For a little while after his departure my stepmother sat&#xD;
eyeing her coffee cup with a somewhat . sad expression of&#xD;
face; but then rousing herself she remarked that whatever&#xD;
else was done we might as well get in order. And for&#xD;
many days that was the word. Busily we all worked at&#xD;
jobs too nice and delicate for hired hands,-books could be&#xD;
dusted and aranged by none but our own ; and if Mr.&#xD;
Howard's head had not been full of granite and cottages, he&#xD;
would hardly have trusted even us to unpack his precious&#xD;
shells and minerals. -But for the time the new hobby sup-&#xD;
planted the old. What. he was about we could not always&#xD;
tell,-there was great talk of mills and mill-dams, roads and&#xD;
plantations; and Mr. Ned Howard and my father would&#xD;
come bustling in, and desire a dusted table in all haste,-to&#xD;
be as quickly covered with maps and plans. New ones,&#xD;
just finished apparently,-coloured and uncoloured, litho..&#xD;
graph, pen and ink, and pencil. Here a road going smoothly&#xD;
through impassable places,-and there an imposing row of&#xD;
stone cottages about which a fie young. forest had suddenly&#xD;
sprung up-but that might have been the. lithographer's&#xD;
fancy, Then the scene changed to wheels and timbers and&#xD;
foaming torrents,-a half-finished mill-dam, with a cart and.&#xD;
horse comfortably carrying out gravel;-and at the bottom&#xD;
a long string of units and tens and hieroglyphics-" wheels&#xD;
-say so much," and "mill-stones--say so much."&#xD;
"If you were anybody else I should laugh at you," said&#xD;
Mrs. Howard one day when she had been listening and&#xD;
looking *i. "As it is it comes too near home, and is too&#xD;
serious work."&#xD;
"A great deal too serious!" said my uncle looking up&#xD;
with a very excited face. "The thing to laugh at will be&#xD;
the profits."&#xD;
"When I see them."-&#xD;
"I don't believe you would look at them if they were&#xD;
here," said my father, whose hobby did not like a check.&#xD;
".And if I am to laugh at the profits," said my stepmother&#xD;
gently, and laying her hand on his shoulder, "what shall I&#xD;
do when I see the loss ?"&#xD;
" Laugh at that too"-said Mr. Howard, but with a change&#xD;
&#xD;
of tone that said hers was not unfelt. " Pshaw my dear,"&#xD;
he added looking up at the eyes that'were brighter than he&#xD;
liked to see them, and with no touch of impatience now in&#xD;
voice or manner,-" you don't know anything about the&#xD;
matter-won't that content you ?"&#xD;
" It would ifI could think so."&#xD;
"Well think so," he said smiling and taking her hand,-&#xD;
"have you so little trust in my sense as to suppose that I&#xD;
shall take a flying leap off a precipice ?"&#xD;
"ButaI did hear of a man once," said my stepmother with&#xD;
an answering smile, "who being upon a wild horse could&#xD;
not dismount, and had to go whither the horse carried him."&#xD;
A momentary expression of doubt which I had once or&#xD;
twice seen before, crossed my father's face :-then shaking&#xD;
it off he said laughingly,&#xD;
"Never fear-I will make sure that the horse is a tame&#xD;
one."-&#xD;
oAnd seeing that more words would be useless, my step-&#xD;
mother as usual spoke them not.&#xD;

W E were happily resting from our long turmoil,-enjoy~&#xD;
ing the, sweet quiet order of. everything in and about&#xD;
our new house; and the summer's luxuriance came wafted&#xD;
through the open windows, and Kate was trying her harp-&#xD;
strings, but softly as if half unwilling to lose the merry choir&#xD;
without.&#xD;
"If ye plase ma'am," said one of our subordinates open-&#xD;
ing the door after an admonitory tap, "Miss Caff'ry says,&#xD;
when would ye be settled till ye'd come and drink ta with&#xD;
her?"&#xD;
" Has Miss Caffery sent up here, Caddie ?"&#xD;
She did ma'am."&#xD;
" To ask if we were settled ?"&#xD;
"Well I don't just know, Mrs. Howard-it's wanting ye&#xD;
she is-at ta."&#xD;
"And when does she want us to come?"&#xD;
"Meself doesn't know, ma'am-if it wouldn't be the day."&#xD;
"Who brought the message, Caddie ?"'said I.&#xD;
"He's a fine-looking lump of a boy, Miss Grace-with a&#xD;
face as big as me two hands,-I don't know his name, nor&#xD;
he didn't say."&#xD;
"Tell him to come upstairs," said 'Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
"That's what I did ma'am, and I couldn't get him into the&#xD;
house itself."&#xD;
&#xD;
"And he didn't say when Miss Caffery wants us ?" said&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
"Never a word Miss, only he said; 'it's a fine day,' says&#xD;
he,"&#xD;
"I suppose we must put that and that together," said&#xD;
Mrs. Howard laughing. "Caddie you may tell him-no I&#xD;
will write it."&#xD;
"And are .you going to-night mamma?" said Kate when&#xD;
the note was despatched.&#xD;
"Yes, that seems to have been the request."&#xD;
"If ye plase ma'am," said Caddie returning, "he says all&#xD;
the young ladies and Mrs. Howard and the master,-and&#xD;
would you be plased to come at four o'clock, he says&#xD;
ma'am:'&#xD;
"We will be very punctual."&#xD;
"Well I am glad!" said I-" I do want to see some more&#xD;
of Miss Caffery,-she is so very comical."&#xD;
"I wonder if there will be any one else there,".said Kate.&#xD;
"I shall be there," said Stephanie, "and will make you&#xD;
laugh with everybody and at everybody too, if you choose."&#xD;
" I shall not choose-therefore give all your attention to&#xD;
your own risible muscles."&#xD;
What a fair; bright walk we had ! For a while there were&#xD;
meadows and grain fields on either hand,-then two dark&#xD;
points of forest ran down to the very edge of the road,-&#xD;
then again came fields and distant woods with here and there&#xD;
a house. One stood at the top of a high slope which came&#xD;
gently down towards us, but at some little distance. The&#xD;
turf was beautifully short and green, and the forest trees had&#xD;
been judiciously out and spared ; the remaining ones, which&#xD;
stood generally alone, had a fine roundness of form and lux-&#xD;
uriance of-foliage of which their very shadows seemed to&#xD;
speak. These spots of sober light set off the sunshine per-&#xD;
fectly. Then we passed a house at the very road-side,-&#xD;
brown, unpainted, but having in its window a box of the&#xD;
most beautiful ' painted ladies" I ever saw. Then came a&#xD;
little spring running swiftly under the stone wall by the&#xD;
way of a latticed opening,-which lattice served the pur-&#xD;
pose of a barrier to pigs and geese-they might not run&#xD;
with the stream. And then we approached the place of our&#xD;

" Caffre-land," as Stephanie called it, was on a private&#xD;
branch of the high road, which forking off towards the lake&#xD;
ran along its shore for some distance, and then turned up to&#xD;
the house. There was neither fence nor wall,-the little&#xD;
cottage stood peacefully in the midst of its green lawn as if&#xD;
marauders were never thought of; and certainly all looked&#xD;
as if they never came.&#xD;
The architecture was in no one style unless that of conve-&#xD;
nience and comfort; though so far as the steep roof, pro-&#xD;
jecting rafters, and gable ends could make it, it was rather&#xD;
Dutch. The windows were of every sort and situation that&#xD;
a particular view or a particular breeze seemed to make&#xD;
desirable. The front of the house had but one below stairs&#xD;
--a large bay; over and about which a beautiful maurandia&#xD;
hung its purple-blue flowers and -abundant foliage. Above&#xD;
this a long oval lookout, of which the sash was slid back into&#xD;
the wall, let one see the waving white drapery beyond; and&#xD;
higher still, a sharp gable reared itself from the roof, which&#xD;
then sloped down until it overhung the bay's side compan-&#xD;
ion,-the little brown front door.&#xD;
The house went by the name of 'the Bird's Nest;'&#xD;
though not at all wanting in size and accommodation, yet&#xD;
something in its lichened grey stone and the substantial&#xD;
compactness of its appearance-shadowed as it was by an&#xD;
immense weeping elm on the other side of the road-made&#xD;
the name seem not unsuitable.&#xD;
The elm had been trimmed up to a great height, and&#xD;
through its drooping branches the long sunbeams came from&#xD;
the western horizon to the pretty bay window, unchecked&#xD;
in winter; but now softened by the leafy covert through&#xD;
which they passed. And from among the foliage there shot&#xD;
now and then a gleam like fire, as two Baltimore birds or&#xD;
orioles, darted about their nest which swayed gently to and&#xD;
fro on one of the long weeping branches.&#xD;
All this we took in ere we reached the door. It is opened&#xD;
to us, and we have entered the hall which runs straight&#xD;
through to the back of the house. It is narrow, and the&#xD;
rafters stand out in full relief; but at the side is a large&#xD;
Venetian window, of which the broad centre compartment&#xD;
opens like a door upon the flower garden. And here come&#xD;

ever perfumer tried to imitate. I said there was no fence,&#xD;
but this garden was hedged with the Cherokee, rose,-then&#xD;
covered with multitudes of its large buff-centred white flow-&#xD;
ers. We were in danger of forgetting that we had come to&#xD;
see anything else ; but Miss Caffery did not wait long before&#xD;
she came behind us with,&#xD;
-" Yes ma'am, it is very pretty, but you must all be so&#xD;
tired,-do come and sit down. My dear Miss Grace, I am&#xD;
so glad to see you! yes, very glad.  And these other,&#xD;
young ladies-they are most welcome,--yes ma'am, they&#xD;
are indeed. But my dear Mrs. Howard do come into the&#xD;
parlour."&#xD;
The same pink handkerchief, the same spotless dress, only&#xD;
of finer muslin this time, and the handkerchief had a shade&#xD;
more pink and a half-inch more fringe. But I liked the&#xD;
wearer's looks much better upon a second view. Miss&#xD;
Caffery was not young, but she had taken Time so -pleas-&#xD;
antly that Time had returned the compliment. Her hair-&#xD;
still unchanged-was of so soft a colour, so neatly parted;&#xD;
her whole voice and action were so gentle and truthful;&#xD;
that one would at a venture have joined her in saying "yes&#xD;
ma'am" to everything she uttered. Perfect repose as her&#xD;
eye was, it wasriot the repose of shallow water; and her&#xD;
mouth was eminently sympathetic.&#xD;
Very different was her cousin, Miss Avarintha Bain. Tall,&#xD;
dark, with hair so black that one wondered where the colour&#xD;
came from; some mental fever shining out through every&#xD;
feature,-more display in her dress and more manner m&#xD;
her mannerism, Miss Bain acted the au fait in everything ;&#xD;
and the perfect delusion which she put upon herself in this&#xD;
respect, made her to be sure, good-humoured and satisfied.&#xD;
There were other visiters already in the room; so when&#xD;
the first little bustle was over, I, the only child there, had&#xD;
time to look about me. Except Miss Caffery and my own.&#xD;
family there was 'very little to detain my eye among the&#xD;
animated objects, and it presently wandered to the irani-&#xD;
niate,-they were more satisfactory. A bookcase on one&#xD;
side, a like case of varieties on the other, flanked the chim-&#xD;
ney and completely filled up the recesses; while amn the&#xD;
fireplace itself little brass musketeers mounted guard as&#xD;
andirons. All the wood of the room-cases, furniture, and&#xD;

wainscotting-was very dark; and the high range of the&#xD;
latter contrasted well with the hard finish above. On this&#xD;
hung one or two old portraits-telling amid all their silence&#xD;
that the hopes and fears of the present generation are no&#xD;
brighter, no darker, than those of a century ago,-which&#xD;
have passed without leaving a trace except upon some such&#xD;
bit of canvass. It is a hard thing to realize, that just such a&#xD;
face appeared in "this working-day world," when that world&#xD;
was two hundred years younger than it is now !-.It is like&#xD;
seeing that mysterious sort of shadow where the substance&#xD;
- is out of sight. But the child's eye and mind soon left the&#xD;
stately lady for something with which they had moreg*m-&#xD;
pathy.&#xD;
Instead of a table in the middle of the floor, there  tecd a&#xD;
pyramid of basket-work,-dark like the other artielcW  a&#xD;
rising tier above tier from a broad base to a little ie&#xD;
the top, where was a cluster of roses,-crimson,99 whe&#xD;
blush. Mignionette and ivy, honeysuckle, miltifloras aid&#xD;
alyssum, looked over the side of each tier upon a bed f&#xD;
heliotrope, geranium, yellow roses, and all thevariety of&#xD;
spray flowers and buds that make such beautiful flagree.-&#xD;
work about those that are larger and more showy.&#xD;
Opposite the bay a glass door looked into the tea-room -&#xD;
and thither my eyes had just gone-caught by a -bright.&#xD;
gleam of silver-when Miss Caffery left her older guests&#xD;
and called me to come and sit by hero nthe window. And&#xD;
for a while she talks and I listen,-pleased to hear the gentle&#xD;
voice, even when it tells me a bird or flower story that I&#xD;
knew before. And then we both listen, for. a horse's hoofs&#xD;
are coming up the road very fast. They come nearer and&#xD;
nearer, even to the very window where we are sitting, and&#xD;
then I see that the rider is my friend of the bar-place. He&#xD;
bowed to Miss Caffery, then smilingly recognized me, and&#xD;
then, still hat in hand, said,&#xD;
"Have you anything for the post-office, Miss Easy ?"&#xD;
"Not to-day, Mr. Collingwood. But you are not going&#xD;
to the post-office ? you must stay with us sir, you must&#xD;
indeed. We want you very much, yes."&#xD;
"Thank you Miss Easy, but",-,.&#xD;
"0O don't give us any buts or ifs," said Miss Avarintha&#xD;
coming up: ".I daresay you're very busy--you always arey,&#xD;
&#xD;
but ' when a lady's in the ease' you know, and there are half&#xD;
a dozen in this."&#xD;
" I am afraid ' Ladies first and business afterwards' wcoud&#xD;
not be a very good rule for me," said Mr. Collingwood&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"0 Mr. Rodney! for shame !-and these such young&#xD;
ladies and you such a young gentleman! Why you deserve&#xD;
to be posted up. Here is Miss Howard and Miss Holbrook&#xD;
and Miss Suydam, and you are leaving the field all to&#xD;
Captain De Camp."&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood sat contemplating his horse's head so&#xD;
quietly,that except for some slight play of the lines of his&#xD;
face I should hardly have thought his hearing very good ;&#xD;
and then looking up with a smile as pleasant as peculiar, he&#xD;
said,&#xD;
Well, Miss Avarintha, I am just such a young gentle..&#xD;
man-very busy, very odd I suppose; but what will you do&#xD;
with me ?-i must go to the post-office, and then across the&#xD;
country to Squire Brown's for my father, and then home to&#xD;
write."&#xD;
"Now Mr. Rodney," said Miss Easy earnestly, "that is&#xD;
the very thing ;-yes sir, you oughtn't to write a bit more,&#xD;
not a bit. You're as pale as your paper, yes."&#xD;
" My ride ought to have cured that, Miss Easy."&#xD;
" It hasn't"-she said, with an answering but not assenting&#xD;
smile. "Now be kind-hearted-and go to the post-office&#xD;
and Squire Brown's, and then come back here and mend my&#xD;
knitting needle and drink coffee and tell me all about your&#xD;
dear father. I tried to get to see him to-day, but the sun&#xD;
was so hot I couldn't-and I knew you'd be here or I should&#xD;
have sent for you, yes,-and what Mr. Carvill said in his last&#xD;
letter. It will do you more good than writing."&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood bowed with one grateful appreciating&#xD;
glance, and saying "If I can, dear Miss Easy," he rode off.&#xD;
Miss Easy looked after him with an unusual shade on&#xD;
her placid face, but Miss Avarintha walked away ; and then&#xD;
up came my stepmother.&#xD;
"Dear Miss Caffery," she said, "I fear Grace is keeping&#xD;
you here,-do let her amuse herself."&#xD;
"0O yes," said Miss Easy, ' but I like to talk to her-yes&#xD;
m'am, very much."&#xD;

"But the wind comes in so fresh-and your face&#xD;
"My face ?-0 yes ma'am," said Miss Caffery smiling&#xD;
most good-naturedly, ""to be sure ! you thought I had the&#xD;
faceache, yes. But I always wear this handkerchief ma'am&#xD;
--I do indeed."&#xD;
1O I beg your pardon-!" said Mrs. Howard, quite shocked&#xD;
at her mistake.&#xD;
"No ma'am, pray don't. You see," continued Miss Easy,&#xD;
so much interested in her story that she forgot the accus-&#xD;
tomed refrain; "you see when Avarintha first came to live&#xD;
with me I never could arrange my back hair as she liked-&#xD;
because I wasn't a spider, with eyes at the back of my head&#xD;
-as I told her, ma'am; and every day she would say to me,&#xD;
'O Easy ! your hair does look so !'-and at last. she said&#xD;
that if she were in my place she would wear a nightcap or a&#xD;
handkerchief, rather than let people see such a twist on her&#xD;
head. So I told her I wouldn't wear a nightcap, for I didn't&#xD;
tlink nightcaps were becoming; but I would wear a hand-&#xD;
kerchief and welcome,-and I always have, ma'am, ever&#xD;
"I am sure you were very obliging."&#xD;
SOno ma'am-not at all. Indeed, yes," said Miss Easy,&#xD;
"it was as much for my comfort as hers, yes ma'am; for&#xD;
I was as tired of the back of my head as she was."&#xD;
When Mr. Collingwood came back Miss Easy was in the&#xD;
glittering and aromatic region of the tea-table ; but Miss&#xD;
Avarintha pounced upon him at once, passed her arm through&#xD;
his, and walked .him round a circle of introductions and&#xD;
greeting. Even I could not but notice the well-bred quiet-&#xD;
ness with which he met all her showing-off attempts-they.&#xD;
seemed to disturb nothing but the corners:of his mouth;&#xD;
and when the circuit was made he walked into the tea-room',&#xD;
and receiving his cup of coffee from Miss Easy stood talking&#xD;
to her for some time.&#xD;
" Mr. Rodney," said Miss Bain the moment he returned,&#xD;
and pointing out a place somewhat antagonistic.to Captain'&#xD;
De Camp who was talking to Kate. "Mr. Rodney, there&#xD;
is an unoccupied chair."&#xD;
" But here is an unoccupied lady," said Mr. Rodney as he&#xD;
crossed the room and seated himself by poor little me ;&#xD;
&#xD;
"and a lady in a dream I should judge. Miss Grace, is it&#xD;
allowable to wake you up ?"&#xD;
" Me ! 0 I was not asleep, sir."&#xD;
"May I inquire then upon what profound subject your&#xD;
waking thoughts were employed?"&#xD;
"I am afraid you would think me very rude, or imperti-&#xD;
nents."&#xD;
No, I will promise not beforehand."&#xD;
" Ah but you don't know, sir-I am sure you would say&#xD;
I had better have been thinking of something else."&#xD;
"Possibly," he said, with a smile,--" but if that be the&#xD;
case you may as well let me give you an opinion, and then&#xD;
you will know for next time."&#xD;
He had a frank way that was very catching.&#xD;
"I was thinking sir, I was wondering who you could be."&#xD;
What a merry laugh greeted this speech!&#xD;
" Upon my word," he said, "I don't wonder you looked&#xD;
abstracted ! And you would like to be helped out of the&#xD;
difficulty ? But I should think you might have heard my&#xD;
name half a dozen times at the window a while ago,-you&#xD;
seemed wide awake enough then."&#xD;
"1Yes sir, I thought I did hear it ; but then they seemed&#xD;
to call you something-else, and that puzzled me."&#xD;
"They did call me something else ; but you see I take the&#xD;
benefit of both my names-not having your conscientious&#xD;
scruples on the score of cadetship,-I am Rodney Colling-&#xD;
wood. And now to change the subject, or rather the appli-&#xD;
cation, suppose you tell me your little cat's name-that I&#xD;
may make no mistake in future."&#xD;
I hesitated.&#xD;
"Hasn't she got one yet ?"&#xD;
"Yes sir, but-I didn't call her what you advised me to,&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood."&#xD;
"Never mind that-I do not expect to have my advice&#xD;
followed in most cases,-only tell me what you did' call&#xD;
her."&#xD;
" Why sir, Kate brought a little white cat from Kellerton,&#xD;
and it cried all the time for a day or two, and Kate declared&#xD;
she would call it 'Mew'; and then I said if she didi would&#xD;
call mine 'Purrer-purrer'."&#xD;

"Why at that rate," said Mr. Collingwood laughing, "I&#xD;
should have called Wolfgang 'Bow-wow' or 'Barky-barky'."&#xD;
--And how we both laughed then!&#xD;
"Is his name Wolfgang ?" I said.&#xD;
"Yes,-don't you think he's a fine fellow ?"&#xD;
"O very !-but Mr. Collingwood-.-"&#xD;
"Well?"&#xD;
"Why don't you teach him not to kill cats ?"&#xD;
"He has been taught--he never does kill them. But,"&#xD;
continued Mr. Collingwood with a smile, "little Purrer-&#xD;
purrer did not know .that--there was the whole difficulty.&#xD;
If she had staid in your lap Wolfgang would not have looked&#xD;
at her; but a dog will almost always chase any animal that&#xD;
runs from him."&#xD;
" Then it was well I didn't run too."&#xD;
"I did not mean to include you in the animal class,-I&#xD;
hope Wolfgang would have had so much or so little sense&#xD;
as to prefer the cat."&#xD;
"The cat is very nice sir, indeed."&#xD;
"No doubt of it !" he said with a grave look of amuse-&#xD;
meint, "Does she ride out every day in the little carriage&#xD;
your arms make for her ?"&#xD;
"It isn't quite fair for everybody to laugh at me about&#xD;
the cat," I said, but laughing myself. "I haven't taken her&#xD;
out in a great while,-indeed-"&#xD;
"Indeed you were afraid of another fright ?"&#xD;
"Yes sir, a little. But that hasn't been all the rason,&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood,-since Kate came home I have had her to&#xD;
think of-and you know I would rather hold her hand than&#xD;
the cat."&#xD;
"How should I know that ?"&#xD;
" O to be sure"-I said ;--" but you would if you knew&#xD;
her-I forgot that you didn't, sir."&#xD;
"My remark referred only to you-not at all to your&#xD;
sister. But tell me Miss Gracie, have you so far forgiven&#xD;
Wolfgang that you will let me bring him to see you some&#xD;
day ?"&#xD;
"O yes sir ! I wish you would! we should be so glad.-&#xD;
You know you can come through the bar-place, and then it&#xD;
will not give you a long walk."&#xD;

He smiled at this; but then Miss Avarintha came up,&#xD;
saying,&#xD;
" Mr. Collingwood, you do look so entertaining and agree-&#xD;
able that you must absolutely come and talk to me."&#xD;
And she kept him in the bay-window until we came&#xD;
away.&#xD;

&#xD;
FINE hay weather,isn't it ?" said my father, as he looked&#xD;
away from his saucer of raspberries to the beautiful&#xD;
summer light that was upon everything out of doors.. "I&#xD;
must be off to the oak-meadow directly."&#xD;
o-      You, papa ?" said Kate.&#xD;
I, my dear-I must go over and set those men to work.&#xD;
Ezra Barrington to be sure is a good mower, but the rest&#xD;
will be as like to cut themselves as the grassinless I show&#xD;
them how."&#xD;
Why don't you let Ezra do it ?"&#xD;
" He won't mow much himself if he has to teach half a&#xD;
dozen others."&#xD;
"Never mind if he does not," said my stepmother,-&#xD;
you are not used to the sun and will just tire yourself out."&#xD;
"No, I'll stop short of that," said Mr. Howard, eating the&#xD;
last spoonful of cool cream and fruit with complete satisfac-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"But papa," said Kate, "do you think it will have a good&#xD;
effect on the men?"&#xD;
"Think what will have a good effect ?-their cutting the&#xD;
grass instead of themselves?"&#xD;
"No, no,--but your working with them."&#xD;
"Yes, a very good effect, for they'll have to do some.-&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
"They won't respect you so much-you needn't think it,"&#xD;
said Kate gravely..&#xD;
"Pshaw !"-said my father,-" well, I shall respect my.-&#xD;
-self a great deal more than if I let those six men do nothing&#xD;

allday, so that's settled. And now to put myself in *6rk-&#xD;
lng trim."&#xD;
"I do wish papa wouldn't I" said Kate the moment he was&#xD;
out of the room. "Can't you persuade him, manna ?"&#xD;
"I shall not try," said Mrs. Howard smiling. " He will.&#xD;
do himself no harm, Katie."&#xD;
"Indeed mamma, you are mistaken,-I am sure,'&#xD;
"By the way," said my father coming in at that moment,&#xD;
"I wish you would send over some luncheon about eleven&#xD;
o'clock, and a pail of buttermilk or something of the sort,--.&#xD;
the poor fellows will be thirsty."  And he went out before&#xD;
we had breath to remonstrate.&#xD;
"Why they should all bring their own luncheon !" ex&#xD;
claimed my stepmother,-they are only day-labourers."&#xD;
"And I am sure there are springs enough in the neigh4&#xD;
bourhood," remarked Stephanie rather scornfully.&#xD;
Mr. Howard opened the door again, and putting in his&#xD;
head he added,&#xD;
"I forgot to tell you my dear, that I must take Andy&#xD;
over to turn hay ;-but I suppose Caddie can bring the&#xD;
things."&#xD;
We looked at each other, and then gave one clap'&#xD;
shout.&#xD;
"What is papa thinking of!" exclaimed Kate.&#xD;
"I am sure I don't know," said Mrs. Howard, "but its&#xD;
Ipetty clear what I must be thinking of ;"-and she bean&#xD;
to roll up her sleeves.&#xD;
"iWhat are you going to do, mamma 2"&#xD;
" Make some cake for those men."&#xD;
" No indeed you must not," said Kate earnestly. "Just&#xD;
let it alone and they will know better next time."&#xD;
"Your father would not like that, Katie."&#xD;
"Well I'd give them bread then-I wouldn't give they&#xD;
one morsel of cake. Now mamma--only look at yourilittle&#xD;
arms and hands, and then think if they ought to make lunch&#xD;
for mowers."&#xD;
"It won't hurt them any more than 'making lunch' for&#xD;
other people, I imagine," said Mrs.  toward laughing; "and&#xD;
as to bread, Katie, we have but just enough in the house for&#xD;
our own dinner. No, I must make some gingerbread, and&#xD;
then we must go and carry it to the oak-meadow."&#xD;

"Carry it !-why mamma you are absolutely crazy.&#xD;
Carry a basket of cake and a pail of buttermilk for those.&#xD;
men to eat !"&#xD;
"Well," said Mrs. Howard, "I am quite willing it should&#xD;
go in any other way, if you will only say how. Rose has a&#xD;
sick headache."&#xD;
"1Let Caddie take it, as papa said."&#xD;
"You know about as much of the matter as he does.&#xD;
Caddie is washing, and I should have to hang out clothes&#xD;
during her absence."&#xD;
"Well I do think it is rather too bad !"&#xD;
"Now Kate my dear," said Mrs. Howard with a smile,&#xD;
"you may as well make the best of it. Your father did not&#xD;
think nor understand- what he .ras doing,-he has been a&#xD;
citizen too long to turn farmer at once ; but this will not&#xD;
happen again, and the day is not.so hot that we shall find&#xD;
the walk disagreeable."&#xD;
"1Stephanie and I will go with the basket," I said,-" she&#xD;
is old enough to escort me, and it would be clear fun."&#xD;
"1Very poor fun indeed," said Stephanie. "Why the sun&#xD;
will make our hands as black as a coal-to say nothing of&#xD;
the pail's dragging down our fingers."&#xD;
"O well," said I laughing, "but I can't go alone you&#xD;
know; so you may carry a piece of gingerbread, and I will&#xD;
Oang the pail on one arm and the basket on the other."&#xD;
"No, we will all go," said Mrs. Howard,-" I cannot let&#xD;
you go so far without me. I will make the gingerbread at&#xD;
once ; and if you Stephanie will sew up the fingers of those&#xD;
gloves the I saw lying about this morning, I think they will&#xD;
protect your fmgers sufficiently."&#xD;
"-Don't put any carraway in your cake ma'am," replied&#xD;
Miss Holbrook, "because it might be mistaken for hay&#xD;
seeds."&#xD;
" Carraway in gingerbread! you foolish child."&#xD;
"My dear Mrs. Howard, I assure you that combination&#xD;
is not unheard of. You are not quite read up in your&#xD;
cookery book, ma'am."&#xD;
"I must grant that," said Mrs. Howard smiling.&#xD;
"But mamma," said Kate, "in the abstract you know-&#xD;
don't you think it is very bad policy for ladies to do such&#xD;
things ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"In the abstract Katie, I think books are pleasanter corn&#xD;
panions than flour-pails and boxes of sugar; but I have a&#xD;
poor opinion of the lady who is not woman enough to do&#xD;
anything that comes in the way of her duty. The less of&#xD;
such delicacy of hand we have, the better; and you must&#xD;
not grow up to practise it."&#xD;
" You'll, never practise anything else"-said Stephanie&#xD;
when we were left alone,-her own disapprobation having&#xD;
faded before the amusement of seeing Kate's. " Miss&#xD;
Howard-how will you dress yourself for the hayfield ?"&#xD;
" In my sunbonnet."-&#xD;
C"But my dear you might be mistaken for a farmer's&#xD;
daughter. Do at least take a fan-and a bottle of smell-&#xD;
ing salts."&#xD;
"I doubt the hay is sweeter."&#xD;
"But more trying to delicate nerves-when combined&#xD;
with baize jackets. Think of your being obliged to behold&#xD;
those, articles, after all !"&#xD;
"Stephanie,". said Kate, "you ought not to try to aggra-&#xD;
vate my notions till you are sure they are wise and right,-&#xD;
or until I am."&#xD;
"I am wondering," said Stephanie, "what name you will&#xD;
bear in this region. Mr. Howard's chief support in the farm-&#xD;
ing line has given me the pleasing title of 'Miss Ste Fanny'&#xD;
-I am curious as to the probable cognomen of Miss Howard&#xD;
a few years hence,-in most circles of society one might&#xD;
guess-but here-"&#xD;
"I hope Miss Howard will always be herself," said Kate&#xD;
composedly.&#xD;
"In other words, that she will always be Miss Howard ?"&#xD;
. "She might easily be a better thing," Kate said, so&#xD;
gravely that Miss Holbrook took up her gloves and was&#xD;
silent...&#xD;
The sun looked hotter than it felt; and we who walked&#xD;
quietly'through the thorn-hedged lane, had often a cooling&#xD;
wind and shade. But when we reached the oak-meadow we&#xD;
found a most glowing atmosphere, and all the mowers in&#xD;
their shirt-sleeves. Sometimes these were partly rolled up,&#xD;
disclosing the red flannel undersleeve ; and coats and jackets&#xD;
hung from the trees or lay scattered about on the swath.&#xD;

the dismay of Kate and Stephanie); and was now watching&#xD;
the irregular mowing of the Irishmen, which formed a strong&#xD;
contrast to the long, steady, and even sweeps of Ezra Bar-&#xD;
rington.&#xD;
Besides the fresh swath, a part of the meadow was spread&#xD;
with half-dried hay which Andy was turning; and in one&#xD;
place it was even gathered into windows. Several rakes&#xD;
stood upright on their sharp-pointed handles in different&#xD;
parts of the field ; and its central and naming tree-a great&#xD;
oak-cast a broad shadow that was ever shortening.&#xD;
We stood on a little rising ground looking over the fair&#xD;
scene, and presently my father espied us and sent one of&#xD;
the mowers for our load.&#xD;
"We put some ice in the pail," said I, "and now if you&#xD;
set it in the shade it will keep cool."&#xD;
"Ya-as," said the man, who had a good-natured, pleasant&#xD;
face, " vera true,-I'll put it by the big tree there beyont."&#xD;
"And here is some gingerbread."&#xD;
" Och it's too much trouble !" said the man. "Indade&#xD;
thin, Miss, we're intirely thankful t'ye ;-for it's a vera hot&#xD;
day, surely."&#xD;
We watched him as he descended the hill,  the others&#xD;
gather round, and smiled to see the little shake of the head&#xD;
with which each man finished a cup of the iced-buttermilk-.-&#xD;
lithe Squire' being first served.&#xD;
The wind was blowing very softly, just bending the tops&#xD;
of the uncut grass and stirring the long windows and waving&#xD;
my short hair. It was hard to regret anything that had&#xD;
brought us to a scene so lovely ; -'wnd we did not move until&#xD;
my father joined us.&#xD;
4"Now papa," said Kate, do you think it is well for a&#xD;
gentleman to go about with his coat on his arm?"&#xD;
"Very well,-when he doesn't want it on his back."&#xD;
"But papa it looks so."-&#xD;
" Hum"-said Mr. Howard,-"'I don't see why one may&#xD;
not follow a country fashion as well as a city .fashion-when&#xD;
one is in the country."&#xD;

"I don't believe you would ever see Captain }e GCip&#xD;
looking so, Mr. Howard," saidStephanie.&#xD;
"Captain De Camp's epaulettes are a part of himself,"&#xD;
said my father a little impatiently, which happily my coat&#xD;
is not. Come, I don't wait to hear any more of this,-if&#xD;
my respectability lies so near the surface and is .so-easily&#xD;
got rid of, I can't hope to keep it long, any way. Neither&#xD;
Captain De Camp nor any other youngster would hesitate&#xD;
to pull off his coat if he were going to row you on the lake,-&#xD;
but a moustache seems to confer as many immunities and&#xD;
privileges as a seat in.the House of Lords."&#xD;
"I thought you were so very notional and particular,&#xD;
papa"-Kate said in a low voice.&#xD;
"I always shall be, my child-about realities;" he answer-&#xD;
ed kindly,-" these false landmarks of breeding I take no&#xD;
note of. I make some distinction of time and place, Katie,-&#xD;
ifI sat in the drawing-room without a coat, you might juslly&#xD;
complain of me."&#xD;
Stephanie shook her head, and Kate walked on with a&#xD;
grave look that seemed to say she could neither give up her&#xD;
'own position nor attack my father's.&#xD;
-"I can't conceive, papa, where you ever learned anything&#xD;
about mowing !"&#xD;
"I have learned a great many things when yoi were not&#xD;
present, Katie," said he smiling.&#xD;
"ut you never had to do it?"&#xD;
" Never."&#xD;
Kate looked better satisfied.&#xD;
"I don't-believe you know any too much of it now, papa,"&#xD;
she said with a.laugh,-"I daresayEzra Barrington was not&#xD;
pleased with your performance."&#xD;
, My father looked at her for a moment as ifher wordshad&#xD;
not quite pleased him.; but whether he had same feeling for&#xD;
the notions that were in such- a fair way to be rubbed oT&#xD;
or whether he thought Kate might indemnify herself for a&#xD;
morning's discomfort, he at all events left her remark un-&#xD;
disputed.&#xD;
It was destined to be a day of trial. Mr. Ned Howard&#xD;
had arrived daring ojr absence, and feeling thirty -he had&#xD;

&#xD;
betaken himself to the dairy-but found neither skim-milk&#xD;
nor cup,-only the long rows of pans which were creamed&#xD;
to a most tempting degree. Mr. Ned went down to the&#xD;
edge of the lake, searched about till he found a long hollow&#xD;
reed, and then returning to the dairy he proceeded to imbibe&#xD;
the lactic fluid, in a way which it must be owned, is one of&#xD;
the very best. Our arrival cut short the performance; and&#xD;
Mr. Ned, reed in hand, came out of the dairy with a degree&#xD;
of fun and enjoyment in his face, that might have disarmed&#xD;
anybody's resentment. Resentment Mrs. Howard did not&#xD;
feel; but she remonstrated and Kate argued, and Mr. Ned&#xD;
only laughed the harder.&#xD;
" Where have you been ?" he said as he caught sight of&#xD;
my father.&#xD;
"Tiring myself to death with those mowers.".&#xD;
"What, in the hill-field ?"&#xD;
"No-in 'the oak-meadow."&#xD;
"Why brother I am surprised at you! the grass in the&#xD;
hill-field is a great deal the ripest,-it is just fit to be laid by&#xD;
the first high wind."&#xD;
"Ezra Barrington thought not,-he said- the meadow&#xD;
would suffer most."&#xD;
S I'll tell you what," said my uncle looking round with a&#xD;
stern face, "it's my opinion that Ezra Barrington leads you&#xD;
all by the nose-yes every soul of you."&#xD;
It. was our turn to laugh now.&#xD;
"Well," said my father when he regained his gravity, "if&#xD;
he leads us in the right direction it don't much matter;" and&#xD;
then skilfully throwing in some word about improvements,&#xD;
they both dashed off into granite and mills and cottages,&#xD;
until-making allowance for the anachronism-one would&#xD;
have thought the one speaker to be Croesus and the other&#xD;
Rothschild. Mrs. Howard sighed, and once or twice looked&#xD;
up as if she would have ventured an opinion; but the mill.&#xD;
stones and blasted rocks that were flying about might have&#xD;
deterred more courage than hers.&#xD;
"Are you looking so grave about me, mamma ?" Kate&#xD;
said when we went up to dress.. "Are you afraid that I&#xD;
shall grow up a fine lady?  If I have a great many follies,&#xD;
you do not think them incurable ?"&#xD;
*" No dear," she answered smiling,-"they are anything&#xD;
&#xD;
but that. I was not thingof you at all, except indirectly,&#xD;
--I was thinking of this 44system of improvements. It&#xD;
seems to me Katie, as if your father was going to fill the&#xD;
hopper of that mill out of his own pockets ; and once in,&#xD;
the dollars will rattle down till there is not one left."&#xD;
Rattle down! if my father had had the use of his&#xD;
senses he might have heard them even then. I think he&#xD;
never went out without a bag of dollars to put somewhere.&#xD;
It was not only on the mill-dam-but here they were yaid&#xD;
down on some new road instead of paving stones, and here&#xD;
they went up in the air per force of gunpowder; and an-&#xD;
other time were exchanged for a new pair of farm-horses-&#xD;
though we had five already. But alas! there was no trans-&#xD;
forming back- again ;-whenever this was attempted, mill&#xD;
and roads and horses became all dry leaves.&#xD;
Then as ill luck would have it, Squire Suydam's gar-&#xD;
dener got hold of Mr. Howard with a plan for raising&#xD;
fruits out of season-out of reason it might have been&#xD;
called ; and what a pile was raised there !-or several&#xD;
piles,-we thought they were only stone and mortar but I&#xD;
know now they were dollars. I say ill luck-for the fable&#xD;
declares that when Fortune once found a boy asleep by the&#xD;
side of a well, she roused him, saying, " Pr'ythee child,&#xD;
'   awake; for if you should fall in people would lay all the&#xD;
blame upon me."&#xD;
4 aL   Then there was the haying,---but whether it did not cost&#xD;
more than it came to, "is" as Sam Weller says, "a matter&#xD;
of opinion."  My father tired himself out systematically,&#xD;
for the hayfields were far off and the weather July. Had&#xD;
less been undertaken, Ezra Barrington's practical sense and&#xD;
steadiness could have kept things straight enough; but the&#xD;
power to make so many ends meet, never existed save in&#xD;
the mind of a speculator.&#xD;
And so the season wore on ; and we young ones sported&#xD;
like butterflies, nor realized that winter was coming. And&#xD;
Mr. Howard was the busiest of bees";-but he made&#xD;
one grand mistake,-instead of filling, his cells as fast as&#xD;
they were finished, he.went on adding comb to comb while&#xD;
not one contained any honey. And what did we butterflies&#xD;
care for that ?-Nothing. We thought the making cells&#xD;
was very pretty work, and had no doubt but they would be&#xD;

little in reply, she rightly felt our claims as st&#xD;
would by no means make the first move. C&#xD;

from Mrs. McNamara as to whether our new&#xD;

Other visiters we lhad had ;-Captain De Ca&#xD;

He looked all surprise, that was n      rtion, but&#xD;
ventured no reply.&#xD;
"Do tell us something about thoeles down&#xD;
yonder that you seem to know so well. What sort of&#xD;
people are they ?"&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood hesitated a moment, and then said with&#xD;
a somewhat singular grave expression,&#xD;
"May I be excused Miss Holbrook for asking a more&#xD;
particular description ?-it so happens that I know a good&#xD;
many ladies in the neighbourhood."&#xD;
."I don't believe'you're in the least doubt as to which I&#xD;
mean," said Stephanie,-" those inhabitants of what they&#xD;
call the Bird's Nest and I call Caffre-land,-who gave us&#xD;
such remarkably good muffins the other night."&#xD;
Again Mr. Collingwood paused, thoughtfully dressing the&#xD;
leaves of a rose which he held in his hand ; and it seemed&#xD;
to me that some feeling of pain shaded his smile when he&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"Miss Holbrook, you ask me a question and then in the&#xD;
same breath give me good reasons why I should not answer&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"Why what do you mean! I haven't done such a&#xD;
thing ."&#xD;
" beg your pardon,-you first reminded me that I know&#xD;
these ladies very well, and then that they have tried to&#xD;
entertain you pleasantly at their own house."&#xD;
"Just the-reasons why you should answer. If you didn't&#xD;
know them you couldn't, and if I had never been there I&#xD;
shouldn't want-you to."&#xD;
"I knew a lady once," said Mr. Colliragwood, "whq&#xD;
whenever she was questioned too closely about a friend&#xD;
would reply, 'O I cannot tell you-I have eaten of her&#xD;
salt;' and I must confess that even I have a little of the&#xD;
Arab about me."&#xD;
" It is very strange they should feel it -as they do," said&#xD;
Kate,-" that so nice a point of honour should be more&#xD;
universally recognised among those wild tribes than in any&#xD;
civilized society."&#xD;
"That is not the only flower of savage life: very few&#xD;
people practise hospitality after the manner of our North'&#xD;

world has          back by dint of civilization ?"&#xD;
"Not at al !thut I wish it would go further forward.&#xD;
And I would not refuse to copy a fine example,-even though&#xD;
it were found only in Arabia."&#xD;
" Or Caffre-land"-said Stephanie.&#xD;
But' the person she addressed: neither looked up nor&#xD;
spoke for a minute, and when he did speak it was not to&#xD;
her.&#xD;
" Miss Howard, did you ever notice the beautiful ar-&#xD;
rangement of the petals of a fine rose?"&#xD;
"I believe I have noticed that it is beautiful.. What&#xD;
analogy were you thinking of, Mr. Collingwood ?"&#xD;
He looked up then with a smile of pleasure at her quick&#xD;
tracing of his thought.&#xD;
" Might not one compare it to the balance of a fine charac-&#xD;
ter ? where every quality holds its due proportion and place ;&#xD;
where those which must come into every-day contact with&#xD;
the world are unfolded like these outer petals, with yet a&#xD;
leaning towards concealment; and where there is always&#xD;
a hidden treasure folded away out of sight, which we judge&#xD;
of by what we can see of the rest, and by the exceeding&#xD;
sweetness it sends forth."&#xD;
"Your picture wants touching up"-said Stephanie.&#xD;
"Why don't you add that like the rose, a fine character al-&#xD;
ways blushes at being unfolded?"&#xD;
"That would be too obvious a remark.&#xD;
"Obvious! Well, now that you have kindly given the&#xD;
rest of the company something to think of, will you satisfy&#xD;
my curiosity?"&#xD;
If I can without dissatisfying myself," he said with a&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"Very well then;-but in the first place I think you are&#xD;
all crying up the Arabs for nothing. I never heard that&#xD;
the salt-protection tied anything but their hands. If you&#xD;
come to robbery and murder, there may be some sense in&#xD;
it."&#xD;

There was a flash of indignation in Mr. Collingwood's&#xD;
face that surprised me; and as his quick glance came from&#xD;
Stephanie to us I was too happy that we were looking&#xD;
grave. Stephanie herself stopped short; but determined&#xD;
not to show her discomfiture she directly added,&#xD;
"nut. tell me how. you like that name, before I look for&#xD;
another."&#xD;
The flash had passed away, and it was with a very grave,&#xD;
almost sad politeness that .he said,&#xD;
"4I think you can find none better, Miss Holbrook, if&#xD;
you have neither respect for Miss Caffery's excellence, nor&#xD;
sympathy fpr anything in her that .you might. wish other&#xD;
wise."&#xD;
The reproof was too just to give offence-even Stephanie&#xD;
felt that; .and now waked out of her. thoughtlessness could&#xD;
see that it had carried her too far. But she did not speak&#xD;
nor did we. Never had crickets such an audience, as the&#xD;
scores that were then performing. I sat looking out into&#xD;
the fading sunlight, and wishing most intently that the si-&#xD;
lence might have as speedy an end, when my eye suddenly&#xD;
perceived a slight motion of the half-open door. Slowly&#xD;
it moved in, and a little startled I touched Mr. Collingwood&#xD;
who sat next me. He turned, and at that moment the&#xD;
door swung clear back, and we saw the fine head and&#xD;
shoulders of Wolfgang. I am sure we were all obliged to&#xD;
him, and drew breath more freely.&#xD;
O.no-don't send him away !" exclaimed Kate and I&#xD;
together, half answering half anticipating a gesture.&#xD;
The dog stopped and looked at us'&#xD;
He was a. very large hound of the old Talbot breed, deep&#xD;
black,, except where upon the muzzle and.legs that colour&#xD;
changed to a brownish red; and with large deep set eyes,&#xD;
finely curved nostrils, and broad and very low hanging&#xD;
gars. *He stood for a moment, and then walking up to his&#xD;
master he laid his head on his lap, and looked up with all&#xD;
helove and confidence of. a child for its mother; yet with&#xD;
&#xD;
a shade of.humility,of~cntscious inferiority, which made&#xD;
the express         e very touching. I saw Mr. Col.&#xD;
lingwood's it        as he passed his hand over Wolf:&#xD;
gang's-.head.        r&#xD;
"I never can meet the eye; of a fine dog without being&#xD;
moved," he said .at length.&#xD;
"But what makes itiookso"I said,-"what is he think-&#xD;
ing of?"&#xD;
'Nay there you-ask too hard, a qiestion,-it would be&#xD;
as difficult for me to read all his thoughts .as for him to&#xD;
read mine ;--and yet in a way we understand each other&#xD;
perfectly."&#xD;
"He has beautiful, eyes !" I said. "But what do you see&#xD;
in them, sirV'"&#xD;
"'Miss Grace, when you have been coming home at night&#xD;
did you never look with particular pleasure at the win-&#xD;
dows ?"&#xD;
"Very often."&#xD;
And why were they so:attractive?"&#xD;
"Why because of the light within."&#xD;
"You have answered your own question as well as&#xD;
mine."&#xD;
"Then you think, Mr. Collingwood," said Kate, "that&#xD;
Wolfgang is a sort of animated Baku-with a perpetual&#xD;
fire in his head."&#xD;
"In ,his head or his heart," said he smiling,-"I don't&#xD;
quite know where it should be located. But I am sure it&#xD;
shines out through his. eyes, and, gives this half melancholy,&#xD;
half resigned expression which tells his consciousness of&#xD;
having less intelligence than.I have--poor fellow !"&#xD;
And Wolfgang shut his eyes, and, drew one deep breath,&#xD;
of satisfaction.&#xD;
"Mr. Collingwood," said Kate, ; as Stephanie left the&#xD;
room to see what a knock at the front door might announce,&#xD;
" will you let me ask you one question:?"&#xD;
,"Will I let you, Miss Howard? Surely that is one you&#xD;
need not ask."&#xD;
" Yes I need, for I Want you to explan, yourself a little,&#xD;

"I think then," he replied, "that it all depends upon the&#xD;
how and the to whom. To say that :embers of the same&#xD;
family, or very near friends, ough#"not to speak to each&#xD;
other concerning the looks or character or manner of other&#xD;

is judicious and trustworthy, and can see things with your&#xD;

-" I wish I were always quite true to my own -convictions."&#xD;
. "But Mr. Collingwood," said Kate, " I don' quite under.&#xD;
stand-we haven't got to the point yet."&#xD;
"Because' you are afraid to bring me to it," said he&#xD;
smiling. "Why did I speak- so rudely to Miss Holbrook?&#xD;
-is that what you want to know ?"&#xD;
"You did not speak rudely' at all; but why was it wrong&#xD;
for Stephanie to speak of these ladies to you who know&#xD;
them better than she does ?"&#xD;
"It was not in the least wrong for her to speak of them&#xD;
to me or to any one else, unless in a way that-forgive me&#xD;
.-she ought not even to think of them. Words are not&#xD;
much-it is the feeling which prompts them."&#xD;
"Then you do think one ought not to laugh at people ?"&#xD;
"I think," said Mr. Collingwood gently, "that it is dan-&#xD;
gerous to indulge oneself in ridicule, especially of. personal&#xD;
defects or failings which are now, at least, beyond control,&#xD;

But I beg you to make every needful apology from me&#xD;
to Miss Holbrook,,-;perhaps I felt and spoke too strongly,&#xD;
for Miss Caikdy is one of the few really good friends I&#xD;
have ever had."&#xD;
"We all liked her very much," said Kate, "she is so&#xD;
.very gentle and pleasant."&#xD;
"It is more within than without. Upon a naturally fine&#xD;
moral temperament, has been built up that superstructure&#xD;
without which mere natural qualities are so unsatisfying, so&#xD;
unreliable-a lovely, well-developed christian character !"&#xD;
How warmly he spoke ! how like a chill fell his words&#xD;
upon both our hearts ! We had it not-that beautiful&#xD;
superstructure. I felt the shade gather upon my own face,&#xD;
and as I instinctively drew near Kate and looked up to hers,&#xD;
I saw the shade there-saw my own tears reflected beneath&#xD;
her drooping eyelashes.&#xD;
He said no more, but stood looking at us for a moment,&#xD;
and then with one kind clasp of the hand that emphasized&#xD;
his words, that seemed to tell of sympathy in his eyes too,&#xD;
he left us. And we sat down in the gathering twilight&#xD;
hand in hand, and thought; until I, weary with the unusual&#xD;
excitement of feeling, laid my head in Kate's lap, and knew&#xD;
nothing more till I felt her lips upon my cheek, and heard&#xD;
her voice say that it was bedtime.&#xD;
"It don't signify-"- said Stephanie as she tied on her&#xD;
nightcap,-' I daresay I oughtn't to have said what I did&#xD;
about Miss Caffery, and I won't give her any name but her&#xD;
own in future; but nothing shall prevent my calling t'other&#xD;

JAID the season wore on.; and yet it was hardly that,&#xD;
it rather flew. Flew very quietly, for the two or three*&#xD;
people we liked best to, see came but seldom; and not&#xD;
even" Miss Howard" would leave her books for mere&#xD;
bonnets and coats, unless when it seemed absolutely neces-&#xD;
sary. ,So morning visiters were left to my stepmother&#xD;
and to Miss Holbrook-who was sufficiently amenable to the&#xD;
charms of society-and Kate and I kept ourselves as use-&#xD;
fully busy as Mr. Howard could desire. Stephanie often&#xD;
joined us and would work in good earnest for a while ; but&#xD;
a double rap would always banish Euclid and set her to&#xD;
speculating upon 'who that could be'. In the afternoon&#xD;
we were of course altogether and saw whoever came; and&#xD;
as Kate's habits became better known it did seem that&#xD;
the late circle increased at the expense of the early one.&#xD;
At all events we had company enough to keep us from&#xD;
loneliness, and for the rest we amused ourselves with&#xD;
Kate's harp, reading, flowers, :walks, and the moonlight&#xD;
reflections in our lake,-" Luna and Luna" as we called&#xD;
them.&#xD;
Early in the fall Mr. Ned Howard removed to Balti-&#xD;
more. This was a sudden determination, but he had grown&#xD;
tired of the Moon-or his wife had, which answered just as&#xD;
well-and after very short debate and preparation they'&#xD;
went ;-we paying and receiving one farewell visit. This&#xD;
change was a trial to us all; and we looked sorrowfully at&#xD;
the deserted house, and thought of the kind heart and smile '&#xD;
that had so often come to us from thence. 0 what a blessed&#xD;

the lines of circumvallation were drawing closer and closer&#xD;
to our citadel, and we knew it not !&#xD;
It had been matter of grave deliberation as the cold&#xD;
weather drew on, where we should spend it. To have town&#xD;
life and country life succeed each other had always been&#xD;
our intention. But now that hopes and interests and means&#xD;
too, were fairly shipped upon "the full tide of successful&#xD;
experiment," Mr. Howard thought he had better look after&#xD;
them; and perhaps felt that one establishment speeded the&#xD;
dollars quite fast enough,-so we concluded to winter at&#xD;
Glen Luna.&#xD;
Plans and debates on other points were called for, but&#xD;
that was in the in-door department. The fact was, that the&#xD;
stream of dollars.did not run our way; and we found it&#xD;
not always easy to intercept and turn them to -our own&#xD;
purposes. And when they could not be had, of necessity&#xD;
a substitute must,-such a one as woman's wit can furnish.&#xD;
"But if we are to stay here, mamma," said Kate one&#xD;
morning, "we must at least go to town for a few days, to&#xD;
get. winter dresses, and all that, you know."&#xD;
"I think we shall need nothing but what we have," said&#xD;
Mrs. Howard musingly.&#xD;
"Why my dear mamma! there is not one of us but&#xD;
Stephanie that has even a bonnet ; and as to wearing those&#xD;
we had last winter, they are a great deal too slight for the&#xD;
country,-the first wind that came sweeping-over these&#xD;
woods would go right through them--the bonnets, I&#xD;
mean."&#xD;
"I know that, dear Kate-we cannot wear those-but I&#xD;
think we can do without any. You know since Mr. Cary&#xD;
was taken sick there has-been no church to go to, and there&#xD;
is like to be none ; and for all purposes of walking I am&#xD;
sure nice hoods will answer very well,-for them we have&#xD;
materials."&#xD;
"But visits, mamma ?"-&#xD;
"All the neighbours we need go to see on this side are&#xD;
very few and very near, and sensible. I know Miss Easy&#xD;
would welcome a hood as: heartily as a bonnet. Visits at&#xD;
the Moon may wait till spring."&#xD;
"Yes,-to be sure," Kate said; -"'but it seems very&#xD;
strange mamma, and I don't quite se the reason of it."&#xD;

"I hope it will not be so, long," said Mrs. Howard, "but&#xD;
at present your father has a great deal on his hands."&#xD;
"Yes, mamma, but I cannot conceive what that has to&#xD;
do with our dresses,-it seems to me that we are the most&#xD;
important."&#xD;
And. Kate looked up with an air that quite rivalled Don&#xD;
Quixote in his defiance to windmills. Mrs. Howard's face&#xD;
rather grew graver and sadder.&#xD;
"I don't care much about the thing itself," Kate went on,&#xD;
-" it is not that,-but the principle, mamma-the reason-&#xD;
ableness."&#xD;
"There are few principles more important to a woman,&#xD;
my dear child, than that of patient submission to circum-&#xD;
stances. They are very seldom brought about by her own&#xD;
agency,-her work is not to build, but to beautify; and&#xD;
that may be done in a log cabin. Money is less plenty&#xD;
than it was, and we must try to see how little we can cost.&#xD;
We have nice dresses enough for visiting, Katie, and at&#xD;
home calicoes will best suit our means and therefore best&#xD;
suit us. I shall like to see how you will beautify them,"&#xD;
she added with a smile.&#xD;
"How many things which I call impossible or wrong,&#xD;
you prove to be possible and right, mamma," said Kate,&#xD;
"I wish I could always take the right view of things at&#xD;
first !"&#xD;
"To be sure of doing that," said my stepmother, fondly&#xD;
passing her hand over the fair brow that was looking so&#xD;
thoughtful; "to be quite sure of taking the right view of&#xD;
things, Katie, one must always take the right stand,--upon&#xD;
duty and not upon inclination. But if you sometimes make&#xD;
a mistake, you never refuse to see and own that your posi-&#xD;
tion was a wrong one."&#xD;
The calicoes were sent for and we made them up-for&#xD;
the first time. I thought myself quite dressed in one,&#xD;
especially when I wore too an.apron of new white cotton.&#xD;
Ah I was a simple child! but so little had dress ever been&#xD;
a part of ourselves, that the transition from one style to&#xD;
another seemed very slight. It mattered but little to our&#xD;
light hearts whether caterpillars or jennys spun for us.&#xD;
Mr. Howard knew nothing of all. this-it may be ques.&#xD;
tioned whether he even knew that we had asked him for&#xD;
&#xD;
very little money. If we had proposed the question of&#xD;
calico vs. silk, he would have said,&#xD;
."Have anything you want-there is money enough,-&#xD;
just make out a list and I'll get you fifty yards of any-&#xD;
thing.&#xD;
But we knew there never could be money enough while&#xD;
there were too many calls for it; and our debates were&#xD;
quietly settled without a reference. As to the mere fact&#xD;
of our wearing one thing instead of another,-if Mr.&#xD;
Howard noticed it at all, it was probably to remark upon&#xD;
our taste instead of our economy. My stepmother knew&#xD;
better, saw clearer, than he did, which way improvements&#xD;
y +-were tending, and made a vain attempt to counterbalance,&#xD;
4f { -it would not do. Things have their due weight only in&#xD;
the philosopher's apparatus,-where&#xD;
"A lord and a lady went up at full sail&#xD;
When a bee chanced to light on the opposite scale."&#xD;
Late in October my father left home for some time on&#xD;
business, and came back as we thought in remarkably good&#xD;
spirits. But we got no clue till tea was over.&#xD;
"Well!" he said with a vigorous shove of his tea-cup&#xD;
"I've been buying some of the most beautiful cattle you&#xD;
ever saw."&#xD;
"Not buying ?" said Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
"Yes buying-to the tune of six or eight. Let me see,"&#xD;
-and taking a paper from his pocket he went on.&#xD;
"1There is first ' Lady Howard' (she shall be yours Kate&#xD;
my dear),-a beautiful frosted Durham: I think she's the&#xD;
finest creature I ever set eyes on."&#xD;
"That's well," said Kate laughing-" I shouldn't like to&#xD;
have mediocrity bear my name."&#xD;
"She's handsome enough to bear anybody's, name," sai&#xD;
my father enthusiastically, "and has more fine points than&#xD;
I ever saw in any other animal. Then 'Snow-drop'---a&#xD;
white two-year old. 'Auld Reekie'-a fine Ayrshire heifer."&#xD;
"But my dear father," said Kate, "who did help you&#xD;
with that list of names ?--Edinburgh isn't in Ayrshire."&#xD;
"6They both happen to be in Scotland," said Mr. Howard;&#xD;
"and as to the names Kate, the cows may have dubbed&#xD;
themselves for all hand I had in it. Well, next comes&#xD;

'Lord Clive', two yearlings; and 'Sunbeam'-an eight-&#xD;
months' calf that I think may prove the finest of the lot.&#xD;
She's a perfect beauty."&#xD;
"But what could you be thinking of, to buy so many&#xD;
cattle just at the beginning of winter ?" said Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
" What could I be thinking of? a dairy next summer and&#xD;
prize cattle for the fair. Why Van Alstein (who is a very&#xD;
clever fellow; by the way,) says there is no surer way of&#xD;
investing money."&#xD;
"1No surer way-of losing it, I'm afraid," said Mrs. How-&#xD;
ard. "But you haven't half enough hay to keep them till&#xD;
spring."&#xD;
"Plenty, for I mean to have it all cut and mixed with&#xD;
brewers' grains. I must have some mangers pit up to-mor-&#xD;
row; and I have bought a cutting machine that will make&#xD;
inch-lengths of the hay in no time. Is there a fire in my&#xD;
study ? I have some writing to do."&#xD;
"He is absolutely crazy !" said Mrs. Howard as my&#xD;
father left the room.&#xD;
"Why don't you tell him so mamma ?" said Kate.&#xD;
"It does little good to speak when the thing is done;&#xD;
and besides I don't know that I ought. Your father must&#xD;
know his own affairs, one would think,-and yet these 'in-&#xD;
vestments' make me nervous."&#xD;
"But would these people mislead him mamma? maybe&#xD;
it will all turn out as he thinks."&#xD;
"Well-we will hope so," said my stepmother with a&#xD;
very unhopeful face.&#xD;
The cattle came, and very beautiful they were, and in&#xD;
fine condition. Even my stepmother was mollified by the&#xD;
expression of Lady Howard's eye as she wretched her&#xD;
tongue over the fence for a turnip. It seemed impossible&#xD;
that such fine creatures should ever look less well and&#xD;
thriving ; and the mere step of Ezra Barrington about the&#xD;
yard, gave promise they should not starve to death that&#xD;
winter.&#xD;
We were eating dinner one day soon after this, when&#xD;
Caddie rushed in with&#xD;
"If ye plase sir, the cow's in the mud beyond."&#xD;
." In the mud ? what cow ?" said my father.&#xD;
&#xD;
"It's her that was coming from Squire Bulger's, Andy&#xD;
Says ,ir.&#xD;
"Where in the name of all uncommon sense did she&#xD;
find an mud to get into ?" said my father.&#xD;
#        ".Meself doesn't know sir-it's a soft spot some place."&#xD;
7}     " As high up as Andy's head I suspect. Most extraor-&#xD;
dinary thing that a boy and a cow couldn't travel the high&#xD;
road without walking into the first ditch they met !"&#xD;
"More cows to be fed !" said Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
" More cows to get out of the mud, my dear-which is&#xD;
j1   the present matter in hand. Have you any rope in the&#xD;
a;. house?"&#xD;
"None but the clothes line."&#xD;
Well give me that then ! how many clothes lines do&#xD;
you think one cow would buy ?-study that to restore your&#xD;
o    equanimity."&#xD;
:      And seizing the coil of clean 'rope which Caddie brought&#xD;
#  in, my father set off with all the men he could muster to&#xD;
4f find and help the unfortunate cow.&#xD;
Then Kate and Stephanie and I laughed, and Mrs.&#xD;
F:  Howard looked grave and then joined us,-in which merry&#xD;
mood we finished dinner.&#xD;
" My mind is quite clear now about papa's being be-&#xD;
witched !" said Kate. "I don't. suppose he would care if&#xD;
all Philadelphia were to see him !"&#xD;
" He would have small reason to care," said- Mrs. How-&#xD;
ard,-" it is none of Philadelphia's-business. Your father&#xD;
judges of propriety by his own sense--not by other peo-&#xD;
ple's want of it."&#xD;
"I wonder if everybody else in this region does' such&#xD;
Fx things !"&#xD;
"You h    etter ask Mr. Collingwood," said Stephanie,&#xD;
"it's to 'hoped he knows something in the neighbour&#xD;
hood besides ladies."&#xD;
The afternoon passed till long-shadow time, and nobody&#xD;
came back; and then partly anxious and partly curious we&#xD;
walked out to seek tidings. The scene in the, barnyard&#xD;
was worthy the pencil of Paul Potter.&#xD;
The cow was alive indeed, but too, much exhausted to&#xD;
get up from the sled which had brought her there; and&#xD;
being of a somewhat spare habit she looked none the less,&#xD;

strip of dun colour along her back bone in rather bold&#xD;
relief. Hard by stood the oxen-loosed from the sled but&#xD;
not unyoked, quietly chewing the cud, and perhaps rumina-&#xD;
ting as well upon the probable fate of the load they had&#xD;
conveyed out of "the soft spot." Away off, Andy was&#xD;
holloing after Sunbeam's vagaries, and the rest of the&#xD;
cattle followed in single file the windings of the brook;&#xD;
while cocks strode majestically about the yard and hens&#xD;
hopped upstairs to roost, and the real sunbeams were&#xD;
saying very plainly, goodnight. Mr. Howard stood with&#xD;
arms folded looking at the cow ; and Ezra Barrington who&#xD;
was rubbing her head and side with a wisp of straw, dis-&#xD;
contentedly remarked,&#xD;
" If she'd been taken care of as I take care o' cattle, I'd&#xD;
ha' had her kiken up her heels by this time, instead o'&#xD;
having to pull her out o' the mud!"&#xD;
"What could make you buy such a looking cow, papa $"&#xD;
said Kate.&#xD;
"She's not in very good condition, to be sure," said my&#xD;
father, "but that is easily mended; and she has some ex-&#xD;
cellent points and will make a fine milker. And now she&#xD;
must have a name."&#xD;
"Let's call her Lady Bulger," said Kate laughing,-&#xD;
"which is both an expression of politeness to the Squire&#xD;
and of our hopes that the cow may grow fat."&#xD;
Even my father had to laugh at this, and we left Lady&#xD;
Bulger and walked back to tea.&#xD;
It became a constant amusement to go to the barn at&#xD;
feeding-time. Even when the weather grew cold and the&#xD;
road was but a beaten track in the snow, we would run&#xD;
over at the end of the short winter day to s he hay cut-&#xD;
and distributed, and then to watch the cows  in emula-&#xD;
tion of human nature they pushed and hooked each other&#xD;
about from manger to manger, nor were ever satisfied with&#xD;
their own.&#xD;
We were all there one afternoon, leaning over the fence&#xD;
and smiling at the strange cries and gestures which .Mr.&#xD;
Barrington bestowed impartially upon Andy. and the cows;&#xD;

"Bad 'abit, sir," said Roberts shaking lis head as Snow-&#xD;
drop executed a most prolonged lick upon one of her should.&#xD;
ders,-" very bad 'abit sir !"&#xD;
"Why ?" said my father.&#xD;
"They lick off so much of the 'air sir, and then swallow&#xD;
it. I saw a calf once sir that died-most beautiful "calf I&#xD;
ever saw in my life !-and nobody could tell what was the&#xD;
matter with him. Well sir, they cut him open after he&#xD;
was dead ; and they found a ball of 'air in his stomach as&#xD;
big as your two fists, sir !"&#xD;
"A ball of air in the calf's stomach !" cried Stephanie.&#xD;
"I've heard of a soap-bubble, but-why Kte what do you&#xD;
mean by stopping my mouth ?-I say I shouldn't think&#xD;
that woul;i stand swallowing."&#xD;
"You may be glad they had both walked away," said&#xD;
Kate gravely.&#xD;
"Why? you think I should have had a lecture? Not a&#xD;

But just suppose Roberts had heard you."&#xD;
"Fiddlesticks ! do you suppose he would have. been&#xD;

home,--they won't have done their talk in a week, and&#xD;
'By the pricking of my thumbs,&#xD;

"Will you go mamma ?" said Kate.&#xD;
" No, I shall stay for your father. But you had better&#xD;

"Nonsense"-said Kate coolly.&#xD;
"Well I meant sense for once. You see while your eyes&#xD;
were intent upon the cattle, mine saw where ',a little skiff"&#xD;
shot to the bay'; and I have no doubt-just walk and not&#xD;
run round this corner, will you ?-that its contents are&#xD;
quietly reposing in our drawing-room. At all events," added&#xD;
she as we entered the hall, "their caps are at rest on the&#xD;
hat-stand."&#xD;
Kate gave her one reproving glance, and then composing&#xD;
her muscles, gravely entered the drawing-room.&#xD;
Sure enough we found visiters-Captain De Camp and&#xD;
Lieutenant Henderson,-which last having voted three legs&#xD;
of his chair a nuisance, was quietly balancing himself on&#xD;
the. fourth with his head against the open study door.&#xD;
"Fine season for walking, Miss Howard," said the Cap-&#xD;

tain.&#xD;
"Very fine," said Kate. "I hope Mrs. De Camp is well&#xD;
enough to enjoy it properly ?";&#xD;
".Quite well, thank you," said the Captain putting his&#xD;
head and neck at right angles.&#xD;
"But don't you think," said Mr. Henderson, who had a&#xD;
slight lisp, "don't you think Mith Howard it ith very&#xD;
fatiguing to walk in thuch cold weather ?"&#xD;
"Fatiguing? Ono," said Kate smiling; "I think it is&#xD;
very pleasant. I get fatigued if I do not walk, Mr..Hen-&#xD;
derson."&#xD;
"So do I," said the Captain. "I wanted to march off&#xD;
after you at once, but Henderson wouldn't hear of it."&#xD;
"One hath to walk tho fatht !"-explained the Lieu-.&#xD;
tenant.&#xD;
"1You would have had a quick step to march to if you&#xD;
had been with us," said Stephanie. "I don't doubt you&#xD;
would have been fatigued."&#xD;
"Impossible, I should think, in such company ,' said Cap-&#xD;
tain De Camp. "Have you been walking far, Miss'How-&#xD;
ard?"f&#xD;
"Only to our little settlement of barns and: barnyard.&#xD;

such a walk can give, and then papa could have displayed&#xD;
his new cattle."&#xD;

"Did you ever know," said Stephanie, "that 'air is very&#xD;
pernicious to calves ?"&#xD;
" Ah ?" said the Captain,-" pernicious ?"&#xD;
"Very,"-said Stephanie with a grave nod of her head.&#xD;
I always supposed the more they had of it the better,&#xD;
Miss Holbrook."&#xD;
That's what I used to think," said Miss Holbrook; "but&#xD;
Squire Suydam's Englishman says they should be brought&#xD;
up as much as possible on'*the 'air-tight principle."&#xD;
The officers stared, and Kate and I were on the verge&#xD;
of uncontrollable merriment, when Stephanie changed her&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
"Have you been bird's-nesting lately, Captain?"&#xD;
"Not lately-no, I have not been there in some time,"&#xD;
said the Captain with a rapid laugh.&#xD;
" Birdthnethting !" said Mr. Henderson.&#xD;
The Captain explained.&#xD;
"0 1 thee !-Mith Holbrook ith quite thevere."&#xD;
"But those are excellent people, Miss Holbrook,-they&#xD;
really are, though you would not think it. Most excellent&#xD;

"I should think it," said Kate quietly.&#xD;
" Miss Howard," said he turning to her, "you have not&#xD;
seen the new Sulphur spring near the Moon, and the fine&#xD;
building that is being erected for the water-drinkers ?"&#xD;
" No," said Kate.&#xD;
"I should be exceedingly happy to escort you there some&#xD;

"Then I should at least have the pleasure of seeing you,"&#xD;
said the Captain; and there it rested, and the gentlemen&#xD;
took leave.&#xD;
"1You are a strange girl, for a truthteller," said Stephanie,&#xD;
--" what doubt could you possibly have ?"&#xD;
"Whether papa would wish me to go."&#xD;
They went off upstairs, and as I sat alone in the twilight&#xD;
I heard Mr. and Mrs. Howard come in.&#xD;
"What does that man come here for ?" said my father in&#xD;
an annoyed tone of voice.&#xD;
" What man?"..&#xD;
"De Camp-I wish he'd do it !"&#xD;
"Do what ?" said my stepmother laughing.&#xD;
Mr. Howard vouchsafed no reply but an impatient glance,&#xD;
and then hearing Kate as she came singing down stairs, he&#xD;
walked off into the study and shut the door.&#xD;
"Mamma," said Kate, "I have got myself into such a&#xD;
scrape!"&#xD;
"Such a scrape?"&#xD;
"Yes-or Captain De Camp has."&#xD;
Mrs. Howard really looked startled for a moment, as&#xD;
if my father's last words might have been prophetic, but&#xD;
Kate went on.&#xD;
"You see mamma, he wants me to go to the Sulphur&#xD;
spring with him, and I demurred at first, not knowing what&#xD;
you would think of it; but at last I half consented that he&#xD;
should come for me next week. And then, after he had&#xD;
gone, it flashed upon me that I have no bpnnet! phow what&#xD;
am I to do? and what do you suppose papa would say to&#xD;
the plan any way ?"&#xD;
"I will see to that," said Mrs. Howard; "and as to the&#xD;
rest Katie, I will make you a bonnet." '&#xD;
"0O no mamma! you can't!"&#xD;
"0O yes I can and will,-so you need think no more&#xD;
about it."&#xD;

"The skating is as fine as possible," said Captain De Camp&#xD;
when he entered our sitting-room Wednesday morning,-&#xD;
"it is perfectly delightful !"&#xD;
"But I hope you are not going to skate back with me?"&#xD;
said Kate.&#xD;
" Certainly not !" said the Captain with one of his strange&#xD;
little laughs,-" on no account ! I wouldn't deprive myself&#xD;
of the pleasure of your company Miss Howard, by running&#xD;
away from it in that style. But I suppose I may infer from.&#xD;
your question that the doubt of last week is nowhere ?"&#xD;
"I found it not quite so substantial as you represent the&#xD;
ice to. be."&#xD;
"Melted away as the ice froze ?" said the Captain with&#xD;
secret delight at something.&#xD;
Kate read his thought more truly than he read hers.&#xD;
" I never could understand," she said, "why gentlemen&#xD;
feel so much amusement whenever they find or think they&#xD;
find, fear in a woman. They are so often mistaken too-as&#xD;
you are in this case, Captain De Camp."&#xD;
The Captain was quite willing she should say more about&#xD;
his mistakes, but she did not.&#xD;
"That ith becauthe they find tho much delight in coming&#xD;
to the rethcue-ith it not, Mith Howard?" said Mr. Hender.&#xD;
son.                                      -&#xD;
"The gentlemen ought to know, sir-" said Kate;&#xD;
they do not, how can I ?"&#xD;
" The gentlemeir ought to go," said Stephanie, while ornr&#xD;
of them laughed and the other considered,--"Yand the ladies&#xD;
too."&#xD;
"But Miss Grace," said the Captain, "aren't you going?&#xD;
Come, I can take care of you all-or at least of you both,-..&#xD;
I suppose Henderson will attach himself to Miss Holbrook.&#xD;
Run and get your -bonnet."&#xD;
I told him no, and with a very smiling face, for I felt&#xD;
exceedingly amused. There was no touch of shame or&#xD;
mortification in my mind, but it seemed a very funny thing&#xD;
that my reason should be the want of a bonnet, and that&#xD;
the Capt should tell me to put it on, and be quite unable&#xD;

I stood watching the diminishing figures as they crossed&#xD;

from the same authority, was the cause of&#xD;
being at home from college.&#xD;

piercing for the last few days, had now lost both coldness&#xD;
and activity-not a leaf stirred. At least of those that&#xD;
still clung to the trees ; but many a one rustled and crum-&#xD;
bled under our. feet as we and the two ladies from the&#xD;
Bird's Nest walked to the Lea together. Miss Easy was&#xD;
an embodiment of merino and fur, with the tiniest jndica-&#xD;
tion of black silk below all; . while Miss Avarintha's dress&#xD;
was as usual of the same edition but gilt and illustrated.&#xD;
"The Lea house," as it was called, was neither very large&#xD;
nor magnificent. It stood near the extreme horn of the&#xD;
lake, but set a little back in what seemed a mere clearing--&#xD;
so thickly did the forest close in around it. This was but&#xD;
a belt of woodland, however, through which little leafy&#xD;
paths led to the farm which was thus fenced off; the trees&#xD;
being now bare, we could see the background of hill and&#xD;
meadow and stubble-fields, with the barns and other farm&#xD;
buildings which were grouped just at the far side of the&#xD;
belt. The house had only one story, but the dark. roof&#xD;
seemed to stretch away over enough of that, while most&#xD;
hospitable curls of smoke welcomed us from the four cor-&#xD;
ners. No coal-bin here, but a great wood-shed-filled as&#xD;
if winter were in truth a besieger. Late as it was the turf&#xD;
kept somewhat of its green, and one or two hemlocks&#xD;
thrust out a,   l-clothed arm from among their winter-&#xD;
bound comparnos. A broad gravel walk surrounded the&#xD;
house on all sides and was overhung by its roof; and the&#xD;
perfect order of everything seemed to have infected even&#xD;
the aforesaid blue. telegraphing, which went on softly and&#xD;
steadily as if it had never heard of vagaries.&#xD;
"But they don't keep house for themselves," said Mrs.&#xD;
Howard with a sudden look and tone of pity for the two&#xD;
gentlemen that were to stand such an inroad of ladies.&#xD;
" Qno ma'am!" cried Miss Avarintha,-" my dear Mrs.&#xD;
How*' d! bless me, no ! They have an English house-&#xD;
who has lived with them always for what I know,-&#xD;
M.Crwn-she's a most excellent person. You'll see&#xD;
her at the door-she'll come to meet us."&#xD;
And she did, and ratified the lady's praise. To say noth-&#xD;
ing of the snowy apron and jingling keys (to both of which&#xD;
I am partial) Mrs. Crown's face aznd manner took your&#xD;
fancy at once.&#xD;
&#xD;
"How do you do ladies ?" she said with a tone as fresh&#xD;
as the open air; "I am glad to see you indeed! rome in&#xD;
pray-it's right cold; or seems so to me who have come&#xD;
from the fire. But it's handsome weather for young faces,"&#xD;
she added with a smile as she looked at our' flushing&#xD;
cheeks.&#xD;
"How is the farmer, Mrs. Crown ?" said Miss Easy.&#xD;
"But poorly ma'am, I thank ye-this last starving&#xD;
weather doesn't agree with him. But Mr. Rodney is well."&#xD;
And leading the way into a room which owned one of&#xD;
the four chimneys and an unusual complement of books,&#xD;
she took off our wrappers and shoes with all the good will&#xD;
in the world.&#xD;
"My mind misgave me it would snow to-day," Mrs.&#xD;
Crown continued, "and to be sure I think it will to-morrow;&#xD;
but it's held off for Christmas. And somehow I've, always&#xD;
thought a stormy twenty-fifth brought ill-luck. Miss How-&#xD;
ard there's a death of cold comes in at that casement ! I&#xD;
would have stopped it out but Mr. Rodney says the room's&#xD;
warm enoughr-he has his table this side mostly, in winter.&#xD;
Won't you please to take that chair till I can undo these&#xD;
fastenings for Miss Caffery ?"&#xD;
"Come here," said the lady referred to, as Kate some-&#xD;
what unwillingly left the fine view down the lake ; "come&#xD;
here and look at the room-I think it is the pleasantest in&#xD;
the house."&#xD;
"Ican't imagine how you can let all these people come&#xD;
into it !" cried Miss Bain with a glance at the cloaks and&#xD;
hoods and muffs that lay helter-skelter upon sofa and chairs,&#xD;
and which were strangely at war with the spirit of home&#xD;
and tasteful comfort which dwelt everywhere else. "I&#xD;
should think it would put you out of all patience, Mrs.&#xD;
Crown."&#xD;
" Dear me, ma'am!" said the housekeeper, "if Mr. Rod-&#xD;
ney keeps his I can't say a word,-and he never lost it yet,.&#xD;
I do believe. .To be sure I wouldn't let that black muff&#xD;
lie on his desk-that did make me feel a little lofty. Thinks&#xD;
I to myself-! And I did -speak to Mr. Rodney about it&#xD;
this morning, but he just smiled as you know he does, Miss&#xD;
Easy, and said that when ladies come so far in the cold&#xD;
there couldn't be anything in the house too good for them."&#xD;

"Has Mr. Carvill arrived ?" said Miss Bain.&#xD;
"No ma'am he has not."&#xD;
"But I thought he was to be here by this time !"&#xD;
Mrs. Crown's loquacity was however suddenly checked ;&#xD;
and bending down by Miss Easy she seemed to have&#xD;
concentrated all her faculties upon a sleeve button and&#xD;
loop.&#xD;
" This button is a thought too large, ma'am-or the loop&#xD;
too small. Now is there anything more I can do for you,&#xD;
ladies?"&#xD;
"Not for me, thank you Mrs. Crown," said Kate, to&#xD;
whosp eyes the appeal had rather been made. And there-&#xD;
upon Mrs. Crown gave it' as her opinion that "there was&#xD;
nothing in the house too good for some of the ladies-cer-&#xD;
tainly!"&#xD;
We crossed the hall, and filed into a room of very differ-&#xD;
ent moral atmosphere front the one we had left. The physi-&#xD;
cal atmosphere vas even warmer, for in the huge fireplace&#xD;
there blazed with that slight, quiet noise which denotes&#xD;
good wood, logs enough for a week's supply of an ordinary&#xD;
family and chimney. But instead of the silent sensible&#xD;
books, there was a buzz that one knew was not all about&#xD;
fruits and flowers. The room was well filled when our five&#xD;
selves were added to the Bulgers and Suydams and Browns&#xD;
and McLoons, whom the fire had already driven to the&#xD;
verge of desperation and the wall.&#xD;
Farmer Collingwood sat in his arm-chair by the hearth-&#xD;
stone, and Wolfgang lay at his feet-paws stretched out&#xD;
and nose upon them,-occasionally raising his eyes but not&#xD;
his head at some extra noise or bustle. Mr. Rodney was&#xD;
everywhere and nowhere,-at least I never could find him&#xD;
where I' looked for him. Now with Miss Easy, now with&#xD;
Mrs. Howard, first with his father and then with mine,-&#xD;
then coming to my quiet corner to smooth down my hair&#xD;
and ask after my little felina, and once to bring me for-&#xD;
ward and find me a seat by Kate. Then he would be mov-&#xD;
ing some Miss Bulger's chair from a door-crack, or shielding&#xD;
some Miss Suydam's face from the fire ; and at last he&#xD;
took a stand by us " to refresh higeelf," as he said, " with&#xD;
a little reasonable conversation." :&#xD;
"0O Mr. Collingwood !" said Kate,-" you to say that !&#xD;

DOLLARS Y? .CNTE              83&#xD;
' A little reasonable conversation'-when you have been&#xD;
talking to ever so many people that we do not know I"&#xD;
He laughed and answered,&#xD;
"You may suppose, Miss Howard, that I wish to think&#xD;
myself a friend, and you and Miss Grace very judicious.&#xD;
But what if I were to follow your example, and beg an ex-&#xD;
planation of something you said that night ?"&#xD;
"With all my heart-if I said anything needing or worth&#xD;
an explanation."&#xD;
"I am supposing that we are friends you know, and one&#xD;
likes to have a friend's opinion even in slight 'matters.&#xD;
You said you had 'no right' to reprove me-do you think&#xD;
friends have not that right ?"&#xD;
" Yes and no,' said Kate laughing; "but you must re-&#xD;
member Mr. Collingwood, that I was almost an entire&#xD;
stranger, and-"&#xD;
"And you see that your shot glances," he said with a&#xD;
smile, for Kate had stopped short in some confusion. "Ah&#xD;
I have your opinion now about one thing at least. But in&#xD;
the abstract, Miss Howard-do you not like frankness and&#xD;
simple plain speaking ?"&#xD;
"Very much."&#xD;
"Then 'why should it not be practised ?"&#xD;
"It should," said Kate hesitating a little, "there is nothing&#xD;
I love better,.only-"&#xD;
" Only the laws of etiquette forbid-?"&#xD;
"No, not at all, or if they do it makes no difference,-I was&#xD;
not going to say anything so silly as that. But I can't talk&#xD;
about it Mr. Cgllingwood," she added laughingly, "for you&#xD;
will make some other side-application of my words, and be&#xD;
as far from my opinion as you were at first."&#xD;
"Set me. right where I am mistaken, then," he said smi-&#xD;
ling. "'If I 'understand you Miss Howard, you think the&#xD;
privilege of plain speaking should be confined to very in-&#xD;
timate friends. Now I go a little further, and think that&#xD;
true friendly interest may confer the right, when' neither&#xD;
age nor circumstances forbid. If I know myself, 'I would&#xD;

would land us?"",&#xD;
"But," ventured I,"mightn't one do harm sir if one was&#xD;
even thought to be meddling ?"&#xD;
" Perhaps so," he said smiling, "though I think I always&#xD;
feel the spirit with which advice or reproof is given,-there&#xD;
is much less danger of being misunderstood than people&#xD;
fear-the chief point is, to be sure of one's own motives.&#xD;
But I do not think Miss Gracie, that it is best to peril even&#xD;
appearances for a trifle,-in matters of importance 'let&#xD;
every man stand or fall to his own conscience!'"&#xD;
" And how of things that are but incidentally important&#xD;
--that you would neither put first nor last?" said Kate.&#xD;
"Such as ?"-he answered with a look of keenness and&#xD;
amusement that rather indisposed Kate to answer. "Nay,&#xD;
if you will not give me an instance, how can I tell ?-per-&#xD;

"I am sure you think you would not agree with mine,"&#xD;
said Kate laughing and colouring a little;-" but Mr. Col-&#xD;

what would you do with public opinion ?"&#xD;
" What would I do with it ?" he said with a smile and&#xD;
a bright lighting of the eye,-" defer to it always Miss&#xD;
Kate-where I could without compromising better things;&#xD;
and where I could not-give it to the winds ! Public opin-&#xD;

" In other words one ought to have a great deal of moral&#xD;
courage. But that is an uncommon quality, and not easy&#xD;
to get."&#xD;
" Because people take the wrong way to get it, I think,"&#xD;
said Mr. Collingwood. " The man who is brave for noth-&#xD;
ing, hardly deserves the name ; but. melt will dare every&#xD;
bodily risk for what they love, or ratherthan desert their&#xD;
standard. And so with moral couragei-let the cause be&#xD;

steadfast but active on her side ; and that pha&amp;amp;ijm of the&#xD;
world's approval will vanish before the reality of its lost and&#xD;
suffering condition."&#xD;
"You have got back to the more important things again"&#xD;
said Kate. "But I think the same rule applies to all, ex-&#xD;
cept as you said, to mere trifles."&#xD;
"I think so. The division of classes would never be&#xD;
fixed. And after all the matter comes very near home.&#xD;
'To thine own selfrbe true i&#xD;
And it must follow as thenight the day,&#xD;
Thou cast not then be false to any man.'",&#xD;
"That is justwhat you were telling papa the other day,&#xD;
that you liked so much, Katie," I said.&#xD;
"1Do you always remember everything your sister says&#xD;
and does, Miss Gracie ?" said Mr. Rodney with a smile at&#xD;
me or my information-I wasn't sure which.&#xD;
"1Not quite, sir,-I wish I could."&#xD;
- We had been too earnestly engaged with our own talk&#xD;
to notice that of other people; but in the pause that fol-&#xD;
lowed these last words, Miss Bain's voice demanded atten-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"Isn't ,it very strange my dear sir that your son never&#xD;
thought of acting up to his name ?"&#xD;
"Up to his name !" echoedFarmer Oollingwood.&#xD;
"Why yes sir,-it's always a wonder to me that Mr. Rod-&#xD;
ney should have been anything but a sailor. Now there's&#xD;
Captain De Camp went into the army for nothing na the&#xD;
world but his name being Wellington."&#xD;
"He might better hav' staid out of it then," was the reply.&#xD;
"But that's nothing to do with Mr. Rodney, nor why he&#xD;
shouldn't make a noise in the world," pursued the lady.&#xD;
"Just think sir ! he might have been another Admiral Col-&#xD;
lingwood."&#xD;
"We don't have Admirals in this country, Miss Ava-&#xD;

it. There's something so stirring in a sea life-don't you&#xD;
think so, sir ?"&#xD;
"Very stirring indeed," said the Farmer with a look and&#xD;
tone of voice that spoke of some discomfort.&#xD;
"And it's so good for young men to knock about in the&#xD;
world !" added the lady complacently.&#xD;
" Miss Avarintha," said Mr. Rodney in his way of quiet&#xD;
determination, "will you take my arm and let me find you&#xD;
a seat by Squire Suydam? He made me promise an intro-&#xD;
duction, and I would bringshim here, but you see there are&#xD;
neither chairs nor good place for them."&#xD;
"Distinguished !" said Farmer Collingwood in a low sad&#xD;
tone, and looking after his son with unspeakable affection,-&#xD;
"Rodney will find it hard to distinguish himself if he spends&#xD;
all his young life in taking care of me!"&#xD;
That depends upon what meaning you attach to the&#xD;
word, sir," said my father who was standing quietly before&#xD;
the fire. "The noisy applause of the crowd he may miss ;&#xD;
but if the smile of God be distinction, Mr. Rodney is in a&#xD;
fair way, for it."1&#xD;
The Farmer took my father's hand with one look of&#xD;
thanks.&#xD;
"You are right sir," he said, "and yet I am so prone to&#xD;
forget it,-so sure to remember all he might and would do&#xD;
in more active life."&#xD;
And the last touch of anxiety vanished before Mr. Rod-&#xD;
ney's word and smile as he came back.&#xD;
It were needless to describe the dinner,--everybody has&#xD;
seen a Christmas entertainment, or read of one, or imagined&#xD;
it. Enough that we had whatever the season could sug-&#xD;
gest or furnish, prepared and served with all Mrs. Crown's&#xD;
skill and taste. Paper ruffles graced the hams, and "bits&#xD;
o'.Christmas" the mince' pies; and if the "Alderman in*&#xD;
chains" did not look like a goose, it was only because he&#xD;
was contrasted with the original. Parsley and lemons and,&#xD;
bread crumbs were at a discount; while pleasanter yet to&#xD;
the eye,-was' that exquisite neatness and arrangement of&#xD;
table furniture which tells at least one .of the'family charac-&#xD;
teristics. "Bits o' Christmas" were bestowed all about the&#xD;
room in every pattern and variety of decoration; the cedar&#xD;
and hemlock beautifully set off with pipsissiwa andl laurel&#xD;
&#xD;
and arbutus berries; while the evergreen eagle at the upper&#xD;
end of the room had his eyes of the bright orange capsules&#xD;
of the bittersweet, and looked quite glaring. He played&#xD;
only second fiddle after all, for on a stand opposite the fires&#xD;
place was a real bald-headed eagle which had been shot in&#xD;
some stoop after a lamb, and then stuffed; and he now&#xD;
stood with wings outspread and measuring more than seven&#xD;
feet from tip to tip,' as if to guard all American liberty that&#xD;
was then and there represented. A most superb creature&#xD;
he was; his dark brown plumage well contrasted by the&#xD;
white head and tail, his legs, eyes, and hooked beak of a&#xD;
bright yellow; while the crooked brown talons told of&#xD;
many an encounter with living and dead prey. And so&#xD;
watched we sat down to dinner.&#xD;
"'Twere long to tell what steeds gave o'er,&#xD;
As swept the hunt through Cambus moor."-&#xD;
How some people reined up on plum pudding, and some&#xD;
upon trifle; and how my father helped a Miss Bulger to&#xD;
the --  piece of pumpkin pie, with a degree of gravity&#xD;
that did him credit. How it grew dark as we prooeeded,-&#xD;
how the eagles shone out by candle-light,--how we ad-&#xD;
journed,took a recess, and then came down upon coffee and&#xD;
wafers and waffles and kisses, until the aforesaid Miss Bul-&#xD;
ger rode&#xD;
"Alone, but with unabated zeal."&#xD;
Then there is a general clearance; and amid bustling and&#xD;
talking and wrapping they all go off,--all but ourselves&#xD;
and the ladies from the Nest, who having not far to go have&#xD;
been begged to go the later. And as the last carriage&#xD;
wheels become indefinite, we draw our chairs about the big&#xD;
fire which has somewhat spent its-strength by this time, and&#xD;
do what is popularly called "cracking nuts,"-in other&#xD;
words enjoy ourselves.'&#xD;
"Mr. Rodney," says my father, "did you ever realize the&#xD;
importance of a coat?"&#xD;
"Sir !" says Mr. Rodney looking surprised.&#xD;
"Did you ever realize, ever appreciate the importance of&#xD;
a coat?" repeated m'yffather.&#xD;

"Sufficient! but there is the very point," saidMr. How'-&#xD;
ard. "Now what part of a man is his coat, sir ?"&#xD;
There was such a laugh raised at this question, that speech&#xD;
was impossible; but as soon as he could be heard my&#xD;
father began again with all gravity.&#xD;
"I know if I were to ask De Camp-(I never saw a&#xD;
name less acted up to than his) he would say to me, "A&#xD;
coat, sir, is that without which man is only a framework."&#xD;
But now Mr. Rodney, you are a scholar and a hard student&#xD;
-give me some satisfactory answer,-what part of a man&#xD;
is his coat? is it the seat of his wits, or his affections, or his&#xD;
business faculties?"&#xD;
We were all too curious and interested even to laugh..&#xD;
Mr. Rodney looked in the fire with a very serio-comic&#xD;
face, and then said.&#xD;
"1I should call it only a reflection, sir,-sometimes of&#xD;
his sense and sometimes upon it."&#xD;
"Then you would not be disposed to adopt a slight alter-&#xD;
ation of Mr. Pope and say,&#xD;
'mClota makes "the man"-' "&#xD;
" On no account !" was the laughing reply.&#xD;
"You see," continued my father drawing a long breath&#xD;
as if he felt himself relieved, "my mind has been ill at ease&#xD;
on this point for the last six months; and I am very glad&#xD;
to have you agree with my own unfledged opinions."&#xD;
" But Mr. Howard," said Mr. Rodney," am I to have no&#xD;
satisfaction about this mysterious string of questions ? It&#xD;
is hardly fair, sir, to set one mind at rest at the expense of&#xD;
another."&#xD;
"You must explain," said the Farmer.&#xD;
"Yes sir, we are very curious indeed," said Miss Easy..&#xD;
But Kate had sprung up, and placing her hand before my&#xD;
father's mouth she exclaimed,&#xD;
"Now papa!I if you say any more&#xD;
And Stephanie ejaculated,&#xD;
"0 Xr Howard, pray do not! I don't know what Mr.&#xD;
Collingwood thinks of me already."&#xD;
" I don't believe he knows himself," said my father drily,&#xD;
as he took hold of' Kate's hands; then looking up, he told&#xD;
her smnfig that "she might either stan4 there handouffed Qr&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLLARS AND CENTS.          89&#xD;
&#xD;
go back to her seat;" and having so dismissed all opposition,&#xD;
he proceeded.&#xD;
"It's nothing very extraordinary good friends, and I'm&#xD;
afraid not at all uncommon. One day last summer I went&#xD;
into the hayfield, and the day being warm I laid aside my&#xD;
coat-unsuspecting mortal that I was!-and not realizing,&#xD;
as I said, its importance. And these two silly girls came&#xD;
over (shall I. say what for, Kate ?) and there-to be sure they&#xD;
found me working without a coat. Well sir, it might a'most&#xD;
as well have been my head. Stephanie quoted Captain De&#xD;
Camp, and Kate gave me -an abstract of other peopleiand&#xD;
fairly charged me with having left off to be notional!-&#xD;
which from her lips is a grave imputation. I denied that of&#xD;
course; but not being able to think of any one else of whose&#xD;
common sense I was sure except you two gentlemen,-I&#xD;
declared my firm conviction that at that very moment you&#xD;
were making hay in as comfortable gear as I was. And&#xD;
then afterwards, naturally enough, I began to debate my&#xD;
question-what part of a man is his coat ?"&#xD;
"Well Mr. Howard," said the Farmer with a very indul-&#xD;
gent smile, "you have taught us at least one thing-there&#xD;
are no mistakes in Miss Kate's temper."&#xD;
"No one could be long at finding that out," said my father&#xD;
affectionately.&#xD;
"But papa-" I said, "Kate did not mean that she thought&#xD;
so,-only that other people did."&#xD;
"0 you gipsey !" said Mr. Howard,-" to come in with&#xD;
your elucidations !-Never spoil a good story my dear-if&#xD;
it cuts your friends to pieces."&#xD;
"I don't believe Mr. Rodney would agree with you there,&#xD;
papa.-&#xD;
"I'll tell you what we had better agree upon, all round,"&#xD;
said my father,-" that an invitation to spend tie day does&#xD;
not mean to stay all night. Miss Easy-I don't wish to&#xD;
hurry you ma'am, but Mr. Collingwood will think we are all&#xD;
singing privately the old song of&#xD;
'We won't go home till inornhg-&#xD;
Till dayligh~t doth appear.'&#xD;
IT wish you would sing it," said the Farmer.&#xD;
" My dear sir," said Miss Easy, "I am~ quite ready.--and&#xD;

DOLLARS AND CEVS'.       91&#xD;
&#xD;
very much obliged to you, yes sir, for reminding me. But&#xD;
I waited for Mrs. Howard."&#xD;
"I did have some such wild notion too," said my father,&#xD;
"but I recollected that 'time and space' are trifles to a&#xD;
lady."&#xD;
"O papa,".said Kate laughing and stopping short at the&#xD;
door, "I have an indefinite recollection of a gentleman who&#xD;
always writes a page after he is called to dinner !"&#xD;
We were soon ready, and leaving the other ladies in&#xD;
consultation with Mrs. Crown, Kate and I went back to&#xD;
the room where we had spent the evening and to the three&#xD;
figures standing before the fire.&#xD;
"And so Miss Kate," said Farmer Collingwood taking her&#xD;
hand as she canie up to him, and looking in her face with a&#xD;
very gentle amusement and interest ; "and so you think that&#xD;
books must of necessity grow mouldy in a farm-house V'&#xD;
"I have said nothing of the sort, Katie," said my father&#xD;
laughing, as her quick glance brought the accusation.&#xD;
"Is not that your opinion ?" said her questioner, still de-&#xD;
taiting her hand, but very gently.&#xD;
"No sir-" said Kate. "At least," she added colour-&#xD;
ing exceedingly. "I suppose it is not true-whatever I&#xD;
thought."&#xD;
"I am quite sure you are true"-was the satisfied re-&#xD;
joinder-and there were no eyes there that were not well&#xD;
pleased.&#xD;
"I should not venture to be anything else here, sir," said&#xD;
Kate trying to rally a little,-" Mr. Rodney will think I&#xD;
have profited by his lessons."&#xD;
"No I shall not," said he smiling.&#xD;
"Lessons !" said Miss Bain. "Who has been giving&#xD;
lessons ? You, Mr. Rodney ?"&#xD;
"Noena'am."&#xD;
Rut1      claimed the question.&#xD;
oId  u never hear of taking what is not given, Miss&#xD;
ain hid'nmy father. "Mr. Rodney you need not stir-&#xD;
{  il    these ladies home."&#xD;
What however was not listened to ; so we sallied forth&#xD;
eight strong.&#xD;
There had been a flurry of snow, but it had passed over;&#xD;
&#xD;
and now the stars were shining out, though dimly; while&#xD;
in the west they were entirely concealed by the thick black&#xD;
curtain of a cloud that hung there. The air had grown&#xD;
cooler and our steps fell quick, and our spirits were as light&#xD;
as the untrodden, unsoiled snow that our dresses brushed&#xD;
from the path. Mr. Rodney walked first with his two com-&#xD;
panions, then Kate and Stephanie, then Mr. and Mrs. How-&#xD;
ard ; while Wolfgang and I joined them all by turns.&#xD;

CHAPTER XI.&#xD;
&#xD;
Every moment is expectancy&#xD;
Of more arrivance.&#xD;
5URAKPARR'&#xD;
&#xD;
W E had a busy 'week of it. Time was, when both&#xD;
Christmas and Newyear were days of expectation&#xD;
and gilt books,-now, having to make all our presents, one&#xD;
day seemed enough to prepare for; and as we were somewhat&#xD;
belated we had agreed to keep Newyear. Each one had&#xD;
her secrets-each chose her particular workroom or cor-&#xD;
nei; and any other eyes or feet that ventured within the&#xD;
tabooed region were met with little screams of prohibition'&#xD;
and dismay.   The house was full of mystery,-on the&#xD;
carpet lay strange scraps of silk and paper-from the pan-&#xD;
try came no less unaccountable poundings. Things were&#xD;
made of nobody could tell what, and savours came from&#xD;
nobody could tell where. We were kept in a .state of&#xD;
delightful uncertainty.&#xD;
"O Kate my dear ! how you do smell of varnish !" said&#xD;
I when she came up to bed, Newyear's eve.&#xD;
" I!" said Kate.&#xD;
"You.-What have you been doing?"&#xD;
"Papa has been varnishing a picture-do you suppose&#xD;
that could infect my clothes?"&#xD;
r" Can't tell-something has. 0 me! you are all mastick&#xD;
or copal-whichever it is."&#xD;
And Kate bent down over me and gave me, as she said,&#xD;
the last kiss fothat year. But I think she gave me an-&#xD;
other when I wa half asleep.&#xD;
We had been busy about things we knew not of,-busy&#xD;
all that week in making wings for our spirits-in brighten-&#xD;
ing up drighearts to reflect the sunbeams on that New-&#xD;
&#xD;
year's morning, till the sunbeams themselves seemed&#xD;
doubled-quadrupled. 0 people may talk of the sp&#xD;
of the year ! there is no spring like that of a young&#xD;
Its fresh leaves, its unexpected flowers, the new life i&#xD;
at every breath; till thespirit swells like a mountain&#xD;
stream, with the numberless rills of pleasure,-like the&#xD;
throat of one ofMay's early songsters that would fain t1&#xD;
what it feels, but cannot. And so on that bitter cold s&#xD;
of January, we young ones had spring.&#xD;
Our presents were but simple, except that my father gave&#xD;
us each a handsome book: for the rest we had worked&#xD;
slippers and ruffles and needle-books, and homemade bon-&#xD;
bonieres,-whence the varnish. Then Miss Caffery sent&#xD;
us each a little geranium, and Farmer CoRihgwood an&#xD;
Indian basket of lady-apples,----so we thought ourselves&#xD;
well off.&#xD;
The moment breakfast was over, Stephanie began to&#xD;
hurry herself and us.&#xD;
"You see," she said, "it will take us some time to dress,&#xD;
and I wouldn't miss a visiter for anything."&#xD;
" My dear child," said Mrs. Howard, "you forget thWa&#xD;
we are in the country. What visiters' can you expect "4&#xD;
"But some might come, mamma," said Kate, "and it's&#xD;
just as well to be ready."&#xD;
"They always visit here"-said Stephanie,-" the Cap'&#xD;
tain told me so himself."&#xD;
So while I went over everything in the drawing-room&#xD;
with my eye and hand (voted the quickest and carefulless&#xD;
in the house) they arranged the cake-basket.&#xD;
" What's all this for ?" said Mr. Howard pausing before&#xD;
the table where Kate had just placed it, and coolly helping&#xD;
himself to a macaroon. "Your cake will be nothing but&#xD;
chips by tea-time."&#xD;
"But it isn't meant for tea."&#xD;
"What then ?"&#xD;
"Company."&#xD;
"Company !--" it was quite unnecessary to say more&#xD;
and presently my father helped- himself to macaroon the&#xD;
second, remarking,&#xD;
b^I suppose I'm in no danger of interfering   h any-&#xD;
body'&#xD;

&#xD;
"Why not ?" said Stephanie.&#xD;
" Becausethere is nobody to interfere with."&#xD;
"Well now; Mr. Howard,. why shouldn't gentlemen&#xD;
come here to-day ?"&#xD;
"Why should they ?-even granting there were any to&#xD;
come. To be sure I could go over to the Moon and beat&#xD;
up recruits-I daresay I could pick up somebody that is&#xD;
fond of macaroons;"-and Mr. Howard took a third.&#xD;
"Now papa," said Kate putting her little finger in his&#xD;
buttonhole, "will you please to let my cake-basket alone ?&#xD;
-our resources are not inexhaustible."&#xD;
"But so long as I have enough, my dear, what does it,&#xD;
matter ?-you can eat poundcake for tea."&#xD;
Our gravity was so completely overset, that even Mr.&#xD;
Howard's face relaxed a little.&#xD;
"Why should they come, indeed !" said Stephanie.&#xD;
"Because there are three ladies here, and ladies are not as&#xD;
plenty as blackberries in this quarter of the world."&#xD;
My father shook his head, as if the blackberries had&#xD;
the advantage in more respects than one.&#xD;
" Three ladies !-I wonder where you studied multipli-&#xD;
cation !"&#xD;
"There is Mrs. Howard, one, and I am two"-  -&#xD;
"I always thought you were something besides your-&#xD;
self,"-remarked my father.&#xD;
-" And Kate makes three," concluded Stephanie not&#xD;
noticing the interruption.&#xD;
"Kate is nothing but a rosebud," said my father looking&#xD;
at her fondly and arranging her hair after his own fashion,.-.&#xD;
" you need not put her' in your grown-up class; and as I&#xD;
am in no haste to have her gathered, the longer she stays&#xD;
out of it the better."&#xD;
"I have heard of people's doingsueh strange things as to&#xD;
admire rosebuds and pick 'em too," said Stephanie.&#xD;
" Not in my garden !" said Mr. Howard, roused to an&#xD;
extraordinary fit of communicativeness-" and if they do&#xD;
admire it shall be across the fence. Let the bud open of&#xD;
itself, but don't try to force it. A terra incognita has its.&#xD;
own peculiar advantages. Ah Katie !" he added, half smi-&#xD;
ling and yet half sadly too, "you are certainly showing&#xD;
colour in, pite of me !" And with one kiss on her fore-,&#xD;
&#xD;
head he left us and the cake-basket in peace. Surely if there&#xD;
had been any Newyear's folly in Kate's head, my father's&#xD;
words had quite cured it. If the colour came the tears&#xD;
came too. But with Miss Holbrook "to the fore" there&#xD;
was nothing to do but dress.&#xD;
" My gracious me !" said Stephanie, "this cold weather&#xD;
sends my hair flying fifty ways, and I should like to keep a&#xD;
little of it at home; for I am firmly persuaded that some-&#xD;
body will come-Mr. and Mrs. Howard to the contrary.&#xD;
Though by the way, Kate, if your father hadn't been sure&#xD;
of it too, he wouldn't have said all he did. But you have&#xD;
your instructions now, my dear,-you can copy the children&#xD;
in the Fairchild family-' stand behind your mamma's&#xD;
chair and nobody will take any notice of you.' Except of&#xD;
course those people who come to look at nothing else. I&#xD;
am afraid to think," added Stephanie with a mischievous&#xD;
glance, "how large a proportion of our visiters will fall un-&#xD;
der that head."&#xD;
But Kate's mind lay too high for the subject-as a moun-&#xD;
tain-top rears itself pure and fair above the lower strata of&#xD;
clouds.&#xD;
"It don't much matter-" concluded Miss Holbrook,--.&#xD;
"so that somebody only comes."&#xD;
Somebody came,-and. first of all, Squire Bulger. He&#xD;
was a heavy weighing and looking man, with a very "slow"&#xD;
face, that seemed as if it must be always in the last century&#xD;
-and a light brown wig; but nothing could be more&#xD;
marked than his politeness. Approaching my stepmother&#xD;
he stood before her with his feet in the first position, and&#xD;
making a very low bow he ejaculated,&#xD;
"Compliments of the season, ma'am."&#xD;
Then stepping off to the left where Stephanie sat he-made&#xD;
a bow some inches smaller, and repeated,&#xD;
"Compliments of the*season, miss."&#xD;
Kate was served with a still fainter performance ; and&#xD;
when my turn came,. Squire Bulger so nearly stood upright,&#xD;
and gave me so little but "theseason," that I felt not at all&#xD;
flattered.&#xD;
Then appeared Mr. McLoon-in a small whirl of coat-&#xD;
tails.&#xD;
"Good morning, Mrs. Howard ! happy Newyear ! How&#xD;

d'ye do Miss Howard ? happy Newyear! Miss Holbrook,&#xD;
Miss Grace, hope you're well? happy Newyear! Mr.&#xD;
Howard's out I suppose ?"&#xD;
"Yes, he walked down to the Bird's Nest."&#xD;
"Ah ! yes-ladies are so scarce here that one has to&#xD;
make the most of them. But my dear Miss Howard, bless&#xD;
my soul ! is that a grave you're digging in the garden ?"&#xD;
"6No," said Kate, who would have laughed if she hadn't&#xD;
been vexed ; "papa wanted some kind of a frame for cauli-&#xD;
flowers, but the ground froze before it was finished."&#xD;
"1Oh-must have been what they call a 'cold frame', I&#xD;
should think,-I congratulate the cauliflowers. But do you&#xD;
know it startled me dreadfully,-really. Mr. Howard ought&#xD;
to have it covered with boards or something till the 'cold&#xD;
frame' gets there. It's quite shocking, you know, to have&#xD;
such things even suggested. Good morning Mrs. Howard,&#xD;
good morning young Jadies ;" and Mr. McLoon took his&#xD;
disagreeable face and laugh away.&#xD;
We abused him for a while to our hearts' content: then&#xD;
came quick smart footsteps over the frozen ground.&#xD;
"'Scarlet's asy seen at a distance, anyway,'" said' Kate&#xD;
laughing. "I am sure that is our marching friend."&#xD;
Captain De Camp it was, and Lieutenant Henderson,&#xD;
and Mr. Snow Freeman-who had come to see his name-&#xD;
sake and help the two officers spend their furlough.&#xD;
"It is a perfectly beautiful day," said the Captain, his&#xD;
eyes quite rivalling the sky,-" really beautiful !"&#xD;
" We have been birdth-nethting, Mith Holbrook," said&#xD;
Lieutwhant Henderson.&#xD;
" Well," said Stephanie, "and what did you bring&#xD;
away ?"&#xD;
".Only a few straws," said the Captain laughing.&#xD;
"I should hope so," said Kate,--"spoils from such ex-&#xD;
peditions are not creditable."&#xD;
"I do athure you," said Mr. Henderson, whose moral&#xD;
nature wanted the archetype, "that when any gentleman&#xD;
thaid ' Happy Newr, Mith Bain,' the replied 'Thame to&#xD;
you, third' "&#xD;
We all laughed -in spite of ourselves; but more at the&#xD;
speaker than with him-if he ha only known it..&#xD;
" And then," said Mr. Fre 1~, "when Miss Caffery&#xD;

asked De Camp how deep the snow was, he said 'about&#xD;
six feet in our lodgings, ma'am.' Too bad; isn't it, Miss&#xD;
Howard, to pun upon my unlucky name ?"'&#xD;
"And why unlucky ?" said Mrs. Howard when the Cap.&#xD;
tain's little rolling fire of a laugh had subsided.&#xD;
" Upon my word I don't know ma'am-except that it's a&#xD;
cold, uncomfortable kind of a name."&#xD;
"It carries no uncomfortable look with it," said my step-&#xD;
mother smiling; "and as to coldness, Mr. Freeman, people&#xD;
will have the pleasure of finding out that you are warmer&#xD;
than they had supposed,"&#xD;
" To be sure ma'am,-that never occurred to me before;-&#xD;
-and capable of being melted-ha! ha !"&#xD;
" At any season of the year," said the Captain.&#xD;
"And even by thtarths," said Mr. Henderson.&#xD;
"I think you are all making a snow-ball of me," said&#xD;
Mr. Freeman, trying hard not to laugh at his own wit.&#xD;
"Then you'll grow bigger, which ithn't to be dethired,"&#xD;
said Mr. Henderson.&#xD;
Not laugh !-there is a degree of absurdity which un-&#xD;
chains all one's muscles,--we laughed till we cried ; or till&#xD;
as Mr. Henderson expressed it, "the thtarths were obth-&#xD;
cured."&#xD;
Our next and last visiters were Squire Suydam and Mr.&#xD;
Collingwood, who came rather late and together.&#xD;
"Same to you Squire," said Stephanie in reply to his&#xD;
greeting; but when Mr. Rodney shook hands with her, the&#xD;
intention to give him a like answer failed; for as she re-&#xD;
marked afterwards, "his eyes looked so much like dark&#xD;
port-holes, that she didn't care to throw in a match."&#xD;
"My father was not well enough to come out.to-day,&#xD;
ma'an," he said addressing Mrs. Howard, "arid could only&#xD;
send his good wishes."&#xD;
"And you must carry back ours,-I think Mr. Howard&#xD;
has gone to the Lea himself."&#xD;
" I am sure he has mamma-at least I am sure. he said he&#xD;
would.";...&#xD;
Is that. a corner wherein Mr. Howard may change his&#xD;
mind ?" said Mr'. Rodney smiling.&#xD;
" He seldom changes his mind--it is only a corner where&#xD;
there might be hindrances."&#xD;

"And pray," said Squire Suydam glancing at the book&#xD;
which lay by her on the causeuse, "is it the fashion now&#xD;
Miss Kate to humbug. gentlemen into the belief that you&#xD;
read between visits ?"&#xD;
"The last Philadelphia novelty, sir," said Kate laughing.&#xD;
"And what have you got here ?-Plutarch! as I am&#xD;
alive! Comparing Captain De Camp with Cesar?"&#xD;
There was the slightest possible curl of the lips that&#xD;
answered,&#xD;
"No sir."&#xD;
"And what do you think of the gentleman in. ques-&#xD;
tion ?"&#xD;
"I should think more of him if he had been a gentleman,"&#xD;
said Kate with a cool misapplication of his words,-" I have&#xD;
no great fancy for savage heroes."&#xD;
"I'll tell you what I think, Squire Suydam," said Ste-&#xD;
phanie, "that when a man gets leave of absence for a day&#xD;
to see his mother, it's absurd to spend half of it in visiting&#xD;
somebody else."&#xD;
"That's what he does with i; furloughs, is it ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Suydam,-" I thought they -ie pretty fast. But you&#xD;
can't tell what he gets them for, Miss Stephanie-the pres-&#xD;
ent Mrs. De Camp has little to do with it, maybe. So you&#xD;
like modern heroes best, Miss Kate ?"&#xD;
"If I could find them, sir,"-she said with a vo i d cheek&#xD;
a little at variance.&#xD;
"Find 'em, eh? Well, look sharp and maybe you will."&#xD;
"Looking sharp might be a destructive mode of proceed-&#xD;
ing," said Stephanie, as the Squire turned to speak to Mrs.&#xD;
Howard. "Mr. Collingwood, you are well .read in the&#xD;
ancient poets I suppose-do you believe that a coup d'oeil is&#xD;
ever a coup de grace ?"&#xD;
"I have heard an old saying which may perhaps' answer&#xD;
as well, Miss Holbrook-' un coup de langue est pire qu'un&#xD;
coup de lance.'&#xD;
" I think some people have the habit of using both," said&#xD;
Stephanie with a little vexed abandonment of her raillery.&#xD;
"Pray Mr. Collingwood are you of the family of Nelson's&#xD;
friend ?"&#xD;
"I have heard various things said on the subject," he said&#xD;
with a somewhat amused look,.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Why don't you go to England and find out ?'&#xD;
"To find out whether I am a gentleman ?" said Mr. Rod-&#xD;
ney smiling. "I could not afford the time, Miss Holbrook,&#xD;
:-I prefer to ascertain the fact here."&#xD;
"But for aught you. know you may be entitled to a&#xD;
coronet."&#xD;
He awth a smile and a slight shake of the head,&#xD;
as if ma           ht be " for aught he knew."&#xD;
" If I         few centuries ago, Miss Holbrook, my&#xD;
patent            been clearly made out. At present&#xD;
Wolfgang friend."&#xD;
" Wolfgang ?" said Kate looking up.&#xD;
"You know Miss Kate, a hound was one of the three&#xD;
animals that entitled their owner to the name of gentleman,&#xD;
or nobleman."&#xD;
"No, I never knew that,-what were the other two ?"&#xD;
" A hawk was one, and I believe a horse the other."&#xD;
Stephanie went off to the window, and Mr. Rodney sat&#xD;
down by us.&#xD;
"What do you say         h-ta-to-pah, among savage&#xD;
heroes?" he said,&#xD;
"O I like him very muc    ut he was only an heroic&#xD;
savage,-when a man gets half way into civilization, the&#xD;
contrast strikes one,-I think he shews less well than in the&#xD;
all savage state. Unless he be such a man as Alfred,'withi&#xD;
light within that makes up for the darkness without."&#xD;
"Yet Caesar had great qualities."&#xD;
"Yes, but I like or dislike people as a whole."&#xD;
"Cannot admire the good and pass by the evil ?" said&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood,-" are you looking for some Utopian&#xD;
corner of the earth, Miss Kate ?"&#xD;
"No indeed-of course one must pass by some things;&#xD;
but when the rominent ones are disagreeable, I am inclined&#xD;
to pass by the person:"&#xD;
" What do you think of Napoleon? his most prominent&#xD;
quali ies  dly deserve the epithet disagreeable-they&#xD;
were certai ly wonderful."&#xD;
"But    ey were the less .important, Mr. Collingwood&#xD;
--who ould care for head without heart ?"' said Kate&#xD;

"Here comes Mr. Howard !" said Stephanie returning&#xD;
from the window as he entered.&#xD;
"I hope you have been eating macaroons, gentlemen ?"&#xD;
was his first remark-..&#xD;
"What for ?" said the Squire. "I haven't thought of'&#xD;
such a thing."&#xD;
"It's not too late yet," fatherr seizing the cake-&#xD;
basket. "There was a premium offered this morning for&#xD;
somebody to eat macaroons, and-but bless me ! there-isn't&#xD;
one here !"&#xD;
"The premium was taken up," said Stephanie.&#xD;
"Absolutely eat 'em yourselves for want of somebody&#xD;
else to do it !" said Mr. Howard. " Well, then there is&#xD;
nothing worth offering but dinner. Squire Suydam and&#xD;
Mr. Coliingwood will you please to sit down and wait&#xD;
patiently -?&#xD;
" Not I!" said the Squire,-" I must be going in two&#xD;
minutes."&#xD;
"Why Mr. Suydam," said Kate, " do you think it is right&#xD;
to treat your friends so ?"1&#xD;
"And do you Miss Kate, think it is right to leave a little&#xD;
old lady at home, all alone, and waiting for me.?"&#xD;
0 if Mrs. Suydam is in the case," said my stepmother,&#xD;
we may not urge our claims. But you, Mr. Collingwood&#xD;
-cannot you disregard Mrs. Crown's turkey for once and&#xD;
eat part of ours ?'1&#xD;
He smiled.&#xD;
&#xD;
I,&#xD;
&#xD;
"No ma'am, not possibly-even if I had not already&#xD;
refused part of Miss Easy's."&#xD;
"I shouldn't think they would cook anything but robins,&#xD;
down there," observed Stephanie.&#xD;
"I'll tell you what, Miss," said the Squire, taking hold&#xD;
of her ear and giving it a gentle pinch; "you want a lit-tle&#xD;
o-ver-haulng., Now  Mr. Rodney, if. you've looked 1Ong&#xD;
enough at these roses we'll betake ourselves to the snow-&#xD;
wreaths."&#xD;
So they went andwe sat down to dinner.&#xD;
"Why does one always enjoy everything more on such&#xD;
a day, papa ?" said Kate-" even little things that at an-&#xD;
other time one-would hardly notice."&#xD;
"1One does not always, my dear-sometimes one enjoys&#xD;
everything less,-that, I trust, you may never prove. But&#xD;
a young gay spirit on such a day, is like a snow-ball at play.&#xD;
in its own element,-every turn adds something, and&#xD;
every something but furnishes new points to sparkle in the&#xD;
sunlight."&#xD;
"That is not much like Mr. Freeman," said Kate smiling..&#xD;
"But everybody seems to look better and brighter than&#xD;
they ever did before-even Squire Bulger."&#xD;
"1You know there are certain states of the weather,"&#xD;
replied Mr. Howard, "-in which we say 'nothing can help&#xD;
looking beautiful': so are there states of the spirits that&#xD;
form an embellishing medium for everything. The mind&#xD;
pleased and content with itself looks charitably at all the&#xD;
world. Put Squire Bulger in such a mental sunshine,"&#xD;
added my father smiling, "and it lights up even his brown&#xD;
wig. But when we look through tears we judge more&#xD;
truly,-it is only here and there an intrinsically fine scene&#xD;
or character that can abide the atmosphere of storms and&#xD;
clouds."&#xD;
"Like Mr. Collingwood !" cried I.&#xD;
"I don't believe you ever looked at him through any-&#xD;
thing but clear air, Gracie," said my father smiling.&#xD;
"However, I am n6t disposed to deny his radiance,-he is&#xD;
a star at home, certainly,-very different from that man in&#xD;
the Moon who shines only on his shoulders."&#xD;

Mrs. Howard: "they say he is the best son in the world,&#xD;
and his mother is, as proud of him as possible."&#xD;
"Is she? very likely," said my father, "but I don't&#xD;
believe he'll ever set fire to anything ; and as to his being&#xD;
the best son in the world, that I deny-a man cannot go&#xD;
beyond his qualifications. That Sulphur spring," he con-&#xD;
tined, suddenly changing his tone, "is like to bring us and&#xD;
the world near enough together. They are putting up&#xD;
hotels and cottages and nobody knows what all, over there ;&#xD;
and the Egertons have bought a place, and the Osbornes,&#xD;
and Mrs. Willet. It will make our own land more valu-&#xD;

"Not our old friend Mrs. Willett"&#xD;
"The very same."&#xD;
"Why that will be good fun," said Kate,-" I should&#xD;
like to see them again. Will they be there next summer,&#xD;

CHAPTER XII-&#xD;
Sweet music went with us both all the wood through,&#xD;
The lark, linnet, throstle, and nightingale teo'&#xD;
Winds over us whispered, flocks by us did bleat,&#xD;
And chirp went the grasshopper under our feet.&#xD;
BYROL&#xD;
T was easy to have patience in that beautiful winter&#xD;
weather,-easier still when the spring came with its new&#xD;
treasures. When one day we found the soft willow cat-&#xD;
kins, and another the yellow tresses of the black birch; -and&#xD;
another the dainty little squirrel-cups that rose from their&#xD;
brown bed of leaves before Bunny himself was visible.&#xD;
When robins and sparrows and phoebes and catbirds, came&#xD;
like a winged fleet at the opening of navigation in some ice-&#xD;
bound river ; and there were&#xD;
--"notes of joy from the hang-bird and wren,&#xD;
And the gossip.of swallows through all the sky."&#xD;
Who could lack patience to wait for anything ,that lay&#xD;
beyond ?-surely none of spring's denizens. An4 such&#xD;
were we.--Our eyes saw no cloud, no ruffling of the streak&#xD;
of affairs,--could not even discern that increased swiftness&#xD;
of current which experience knows is near the fall. T~&#xD;
three at Glen Luna all was absolutely lovely and placid&#xD;
but those to whom Time had given the freedom of his great&#xD;
city of life, had their trials-hope disappointed and fears&#xD;
confirmed. Mr. Howard might say to himself " if I can&#xD;
have patience !" To take a little wisdom along with it&#xD;
never occurred tehim, and improvements went on as&#xD;
as ever. Mill was finished, mill-dam in progress, fe i    {&#xD;
walls were already decked with dwarfs and riders; andt  s='&#xD;
rocks for the stone cottages were blasting, blasting, till&#xD;
ears were tired. But-in short it was a bad honey&#xD;

and of course there was nothing to do but to make combs ;&#xD;
and lest the workers should starve, the little swarm at home&#xD;
were very careful not to overeat themselves-figuratively&#xD;
speaking.&#xD;
Despite Mrs. Howard's fears the cattle had survived the&#xD;
winter,-how, Ezra Barrington best knew, and it was&#xD;
doubtless owing to his.exceeding good care and manage-&#xD;
ment. But' feed had not been always plenty nor easy to&#xD;
get, and Snowdrop's hide had certainly lost some of its&#xD;
marks of high living. Lady Bulger had roughed it better&#xD;
than the rest, being of a rougher nature to begin with ; and&#xD;
now that grass was to be had for the cropping, all difficulty&#xD;
on that score was over. It was a difficulty which had hardly&#xD;
reached our apprehension.'&#xD;
" Will anybody bear me company in a long walk ?"&#xD;
said Mr. Rodney as he entered our sitting-room one April&#xD;
morning.&#xD;
"One body will," said I.&#xD;
"And another," said Kate.&#xD;
"Are you going up the hill difficulty-or discretion ?"&#xD;
said Stephanie. "Because if it's the last, Mr. Collingwood,&#xD;
I never shall get to the top, so it's no use to try,-I may as&#xD;
well stay where I am, in the valley of 'fits and starts'."&#xD;
"het one of the starts take you with us Miss Holbrook,"&#xD;
he answered smiling, "and I will promise to help you up&#xD;
every hill we come to."&#xD;
"Don't attempt to help me up that one," said Stephanie,&#xD;
"for I tell you it's no use. If you dragged me up, I should&#xD;
roll right down again-the first thing I did,-if I didn't take&#xD;
a wilful start and run."&#xD;
"I have no opinion of dragging, up any hill," he replied;&#xD;
and we went to get ready.&#xD;
"Are you going to the Brown bluff, Mr. Collingwood?"&#xD;
I said.&#xD;
"No, not this morning,-unlesssome of you wish it."&#xD;
"I don't-I like a new walk better. 0 you should have&#xD;
seen the flag I had up there last summer 1"&#xD;
-."I did !" said he with a smile, "and thought of Purrer-&#xD;
purrer immediately."&#xD;
"Purrer-purrer! what could make you think of her? 1I'm&#xD;
sure my white flag didn't look much like puey"&#xD;

&#xD;
"Not much,--but extremely like pussy's mistress."&#xD;
"So I thought," said Kate. "It went about as straight&#xD;
to my heart, Gracie, as if I had been eyeing you through a&#xD;
telescope,-or had caught some shadow or reflection of the&#xD;
little figure that was out of sight."&#xD;
"Mr. Collingwood," said Stephanie, "do you know every-&#xD;
thing ?"&#xD;
~  Not quite," *said he smiling,-" I am in no danger of&#xD;
leading an idle life for want of something to learn."&#xD;
"But don't you know most things that other people&#xD;
don't know ?"&#xD;
"I am not very well acquainted with other people's ac-&#xD;
quirements."&#xD;
"Look here," said Stephanie, "you're dragging me up&#xD;
the patient hill at present, and in the most roundabout way&#xD;
that can be. Won't you just give me a plain answer i&#xD;
-didn't you ever study strange out of the way things ?"&#xD;
"Sometimes-a few,"-said Mr. Collingwood with a&#xD;
rather comical play of the mouth. "What do you want&#xD;
to know, Miss Stephanie?-I'm sure that isstraightforward."&#xD;
"I .want to know why that white flag looked like this&#xD;
young one,-for it certainly did, even to my unsentimental&#xD;
eyes."&#xD;
"Unsentimental-yes, none other could see it. Senti-&#xD;
mental eyes look rather at the effect of matter upon mind&#xD;
than of mind upon niatter."&#xD;
" I confess that my eyes look into obscurity at present,"&#xD;
said Stephanie.&#xD;
" To come into daylight then-I think that every work&#xD;
not purely mechanical bears the stamp of the author's char-&#xD;
acter. A very country-seat will shew whether ignorance&#xD;
or education be at the head of it,-whether its owner have&#xD;
cultivation and refinement as well as taste."&#xD;
" Do you think they can be separated ?" said Kate.&#xD;
"Not if you take the word taste in its true sense. There&#xD;
is a sort, current in the world, which sometimes knows&#xD;
strange associates; "and many persons have a key to the&#xD;
streams of beauty, who can by no means unlock the secrets&#xD;
of the fountain-head."&#xD;
" But Grace and the flag .I was not talking of country~&#xD;

"I said every work,-there was so much of Miss Grace's&#xD;
character in the flag, that it was not-very hard to imagine&#xD;
it a personification of her own little self." K&#xD;
"In other words td make a dissolving view-Vanish the&#xD;
flag into thin air, leaving Grace on the top of a pine-tree!&#xD;
Ilf I had followed out that train of reasoning in the stage-&#xD;
coach, I should have been desperately uncomfortable !"&#xD;
"You are disposed of now, Miss Gracie," said Mr. Col-&#xD;
lingwood laughing.&#xD;
"But I think you are all wrong," I said,-"the flag made&#xD;
me think of Kate, so it must have looked like her. You&#xD;
didn't see straight, Mr. Collingwood."&#xD;
"Maybe I did," he answered with a smile.&#xD;
"After all," said Stephanie, "Grace didn't put up the flag&#xD;
--we ought to have seen Andy."&#xD;
"No indeed !" said Kate,-" the plan is the work, to all&#xD;
intents and purposes."&#xD;
"To all intents, if you please," said Stephanie,-" I de-&#xD;
mur to the purposes. Instance Squire Bulger's saw-mill&#xD;
yonder-built over a stream that didn't exist. Looks like&#xD;
him, doesn't it, Mr. Collingwood?"&#xD;
"I think you would make a difficult pupil, Miss Hol-&#xD;
brook. I should need to study one or two more out of the&#xD;
way things if I had to give you lessons."&#xD;
Thus talking and discussing, we had followed a winding&#xD;
foot-path to the very top of what was called the Green hill&#xD;
--from the crops of winter grain which there skewed their&#xD;
beauty. The owner never planted it with anything else,&#xD;
except where a short alternation became absolutely neces-&#xD;
sary ; and in the spring Green hill was the prettiest sight&#xD;
that could be. A small clump of hickories grew near the&#xD;
top, and there we sat us down to rest and look about.&#xD;
We were to the north-east of our own Glen, which lay&#xD;
* full in sight ; as did also the Bird's Nest, shadowed by its&#xD;
great. tree. The lake lay beyond,'visible from horn to&#xD;
horn, and gleaming in the soft ring sun ; and on the fur-&#xD;
ther gently sloping shore the shite houses at the Moon&#xD;
shone clean and bright, as if their spring confusion were&#xD;
already over. Between us and the level ground there was&#xD;
nothing but wintergrain,-some three inches high now,&#xD;
and covering the st-ells and holl4s with a surpassing ver-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLLARS AND UENT.              107&#xD;
,dre that was more or less bright in places, as the spears&#xD;
bent before the breeze or stood breathlessly waiting its ap-&#xD;
proach. There was not a sound, there was not a stir, ex-&#xD;
cept in nature's pure kingdom,-'-tke faint "haw !" to some&#xD;
distant team seemed hardly to belong to any other; and&#xD;
now and then a bird in the tree-top above us&#xD;
"Shook out of his little throat floods of delirious music.-"&#xD;
as Longfellow has it.&#xD;
Far to the west stood the little brown church; and some-&#xD;
what nearer, a faint touch of blue against the budding trees&#xD;
told of the Lea fireside. There Mr. Rodney's eyes were&#xD;
fixed,--fixed with such thoughtful, grave expression, that&#xD;
no one cared to interrupt his musings. And the phoebes&#xD;
called to each other, and the song sparrows uttered their&#xD;
joyous allegro ; and breeze and sun and song seemed to&#xD;
pass on like a flood-ever varying, ever the same,-a&#xD;
kind of mingled sweetness for which the mind had no&#xD;
prism.&#xD;
On all sides of us a well-cultivated country stretched&#xD;
away to the blue distance. Long rolls of grass and stub.&#xD;
ble and ploughed fields, with here and there a patch of dark&#xD;
forest, or the white spot of some farmhouse and the sangui-&#xD;
nary hue of its barn. Often both buildings were of the&#xD;
same uniform no-paint colour, and hardly discernible in the,&#xD;
distance. There was little rough ground to be seen, and&#xD;
what appeared so by contrast, would hardly have deserved&#xD;
the name in a ruder region. A few heights of "sterner&#xD;
stuff" than their neighbours were left to choose and enjoy&#xD;
their own tenants,-stones, and wild plants, and trees that&#xD;
disdained cultivation and shewed the want of it; while&#xD;
their tumbling brooks felt the power of influence when they&#xD;
reached the lower grounds, and flowed gently and with fer-&#xD;
tilizing leisure. These rude spots were but few. FarmW&#xD;
and farm-houses, mills, water-courses, rail fences, a stord&#xD;
wall or two, and ; a n  sprinkling of pleasure grounds,&#xD;
made up the landscape. In the extreme south a short line&#xD;
of blue pyramids checked the soft cultivation, and told us&#xD;
that such was not all the world.&#xD;

"I believe I have, Miss Gracie. How should daylight&#xD;
out of doors make you think of evenings at home ?"&#xD;
"Those blue mountains, you know-they're like those the&#xD;
squirrel wanted to get to."&#xD;
"I don't think the squirrel was so far wrong after all,"&#xD;
said Kate-" seeing he didn't know any better,-blue&#xD;
mountains are some of the most attractive things in the&#xD;
world."&#xD;
"Why ?" said Mr. Collingwood.&#xD;
"They look so pure and peaceful-so resting,-as if&#xD;
rough winds could not blow there,-as if there one could&#xD;
never be weary."&#xD;
" It is but earth still," he answered, "and a fair ,type of&#xD;
earth's power to satisfy; so inviting in the distance, so cold&#xD;
when reached. Many a one has proved the squirrel's expe-&#xD;
rience. The only land&#xD;
'Where tempests never beat nor billows roar,'&#xD;
lies out of sight; and concerning it there 'have been no&#xD;
more striking words written than those few, 'I shall be&#xD;
satisfied!'" .&#xD;
He spoke with a grave realization that seemed an echo&#xD;
from the very land he referred to.&#xD;
"But it's so pleasant to take a bright view of things !"&#xD;
sMid Stephanie breaking through a silence she had- no liking&#xD;
for.&#xD;
"So pleasant that I would seek for the brightest.-If my&#xD;
words bear any gloomy construction, Miss Holbrook, I ex-&#xD;
pressed myself ill."&#xD;
"But Mr. Collingwood," said Kate rather timidly, "do&#xD;
you think aerial perspective is 'meant to serve no pur.&#xD;
pse? that one ought to disregard its effect as much as&#xD;
possible ?"&#xD;
* "By no means-either in the physical or mental world.&#xD;
It would be a sorrowful thing if all the chequer work of&#xD;
life were as distinct at a distance a'hear by. And yet Miss&#xD;
Kate it is good sometimes to look through a telescope,-&#xD;
good always to approach hope's blue mountains with a&#xD;
mind braced for possibilities. No joy was ever less sweet&#xD;
for a moderated expectation."&#xD;
"1 don't believe in your telescopic view," said Stephamie.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Why shouldn't I think that little brown speck to be a&#xD;
hermitage instead of a hut ?"&#xD;
"And that huts and misery do not exist ?"&#xD;
"In my neighbourhood-they may be somewhere in the&#xD;
world, of course."&#xD;
" Why shouldn't a physician try to think all his patients&#xD;
in perfect health ?"&#xD;
"Fiddle-de-dee ! they're in his charge, and have called&#xD;
for his help."&#xD;
"And did you never hearan appeal from a mere outside&#xD;
of wretchedness ? Ah Miss Stephanie-that will not do!&#xD;
I wish I had a spy-glass to give you a nearer view of that&#xD;
same brown speck. You would think it spoke pretty&#xD;
plainly."&#xD;
1"I wish you hadn't! Don't it make you sad to go to&#xD;
such places ?"&#xD;
"Then why should one go ?-I don't like to feel sad.&#xD;
Now the physician knows he can do something."&#xD;
"I beg your pardon-he only knows that he can try,-&#xD;
whether he shall succeed or not is a matter quite out of'his&#xD;
hands. Miss Kate, will you not give us the result of this&#xD;
long meditation ?"&#xD;
"I was thinking that one does not always know how to&#xD;
try."&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood smiled.&#xD;
"But one can always use those powerful simples, en-&#xD;
couragement and sympathy,-and Miss Kate," he added&#xD;
gently, "one ought to know how to apply the catholi-&#xD;
con."&#xD;
"Yes, that is very true."&#xD;
" They are such dreadful places to go to !" said Stephanie,a.-&#xD;
" I don't suppose one in fifty keeps a broom, and even the&#xD;
farmhouses are curious enough."&#xD;
"I have always thought," said Mr. Oollingwood, "that&#xD;
there is nothing Zore beautiful about the sunlight, than its&#xD;
seeking the dar~te places and giving at least a. passing&#xD;
notice to ail that is most shunned and despised. And no-&#xD;
body ever thought that those pure rays compromised their&#xD;
dignity."&#xD;

ousness and mischievous jisinuation, "there isn't apt to b8&#xD;

Mr. 'Ollingwood coloured a little, but then lightly an-&#xD;
swered her according to the letter.&#xD;
"If you charge me with being fanciful, I must fall back&#xD;
upon George Herbert. He says,&#xD;
'Shine like the sun in every corner.'"&#xD;
He is fanciful-I don't like him."&#xD;
"I do," said Kate. "But MW Collingwood, the sun has&#xD;
a power of going about which very much assists his benev-&#xD;
olence."&#xD;
"I know that very well, said he smiling, "but remem-&#xD;
ber too, Miss Kate, the sun is felt where he cannot be&#xD;
peen."&#xD;
"Does your telescope say that is water or mud down&#xD;
yonder ?" said Stephanie as we began to descend the hill.&#xD;
"Mud-decidedly."&#xD;
"Are there no springs hereabouts ?"&#xD;
"There is one not far off," he answered somewhat comi-&#xD;
cally ; "but unluckily it is in a garden, and the garden&#xD;
surrounds a house-painted red ! and the front door has a&#xD;
horizontal division."&#xD;
"1How absurd you are!" said Stephanie while Kate and&#xD;
I laughed. " Is it a hut ?"&#xD;
"No-a farmhouse."&#xD;
"That is bad. I could go to a hut for water, but these&#xD;
farmhouse people would pull us in and put us in rocking-&#xD;
chairs."&#xD;
"And the consequences, Miss Stephanie ?"&#xD;
"The consequences would be that we should have to sit&#xD;
and talk to them."&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood stood with folded arms as if awaiting&#xD;
further information.&#xD;
"Don't you see !" said Stephanie-" they would take it&#xD;
as a.i.i&#xD;
as"And perhaps come and see us in turn," said Kate.&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood laughed and walked on.&#xD;
"You are quite beyond me now !" he said. "I thought I&#xD;
could answer all your objections, but I am out of my depth.&#xD;
HIowever if you will wait for mue at a safe distance, I will&#xD;
&#xD;
bring you some water-I think I can be trusted'with a&#xD;
tumbler; for unfortunately," he added with a smile that&#xD;
was keen as well as bright, "I have some acquafgtince with&#xD;
the family."&#xD;
"We do not need it in the least," Kate said,-" you&#xD;
need not take the trouble-we can wait till we get home."&#xD;
"It is no trouble Miss Kate-you will be quite safe if&#xD;
you stand here. There is very little passing on this road,&#xD;
and I shall be back in a moment."&#xD;
He went before we could hinder it, and we stood rather&#xD;
thoughtfully eyeing the dell. and the red house and Mr.&#xD;
Rodney and the divided front door-which had certainly&#xD;
opened to admit him with all the unanimity of good will.&#xD;
It was but a moment as he said before he brought us a&#xD;
pitcher of the brightest and coldest water, and glasses which,&#xD;
if not cut, yere admirably clean. They were scarce filled&#xD;
before a messenger came running from the hut.'A little&#xD;
girl-with a very pretty face, bare feet, and toilet arrange-&#xD;
ments that spoke an abundance of out-door play.&#xD;
"Mr. Rodney," she said in a shy half whisper, and&#xD;
looking at us between words, "Granny said to tell the&#xD;
ladies if they'd drink some milk, I'd fetch it to 'em right&#xD;
away."&#xD;
"Why don't you ask the ladies themselves, Susie ?"&#xD;
The child looked up at Kate, but did not open her lips&#xD;
except to smile ; and the answer she got was so very smi-&#xD;
ling and pleasant, that her next question was somewhat&#xD;
startling-though spoken low as at first.&#xD;
" Mr. Rodney who is the pretty lady ?"&#xD;
Stephanie took her tumbler from her lips and laughed,&#xD;
while Kate reversed that action and blushed; and Mr. Col-&#xD;
lingwood with perfect gravity gave.our names in the order *&#xD;
of seniority.&#xD;
" I should like to liss her, so much!" said the child fold-&#xD;
ing her hands, together.&#xD;
"You may kiss me, Susie," said Mr. Collingwood quick-&#xD;
ly,-" will not that do as well? Or,if you like it better, I&#xD;
will kiss you"~&#xD;
But Susie did not choose to wait for that, and after a&#xD;
little twisting of herself about she turned round and scam-&#xD;

presently resumed our walk.&#xD;
"1Do farmhouse children usually exhibit such discern-&#xD;
ment ?" said Stephanie with the delight of annoying one of&#xD;
her companions and the hope of annoying two. But that&#xD;
failed.&#xD;
"As what, Miss Stephanie ?"&#xD;
" As this little rustic we have just seen."&#xD;
"And as how exhibited ?"&#xD;
"Why did you interfere to hinder the child's wish?"&#xD;
said Miss Holbrook abruptly.&#xD;
"I trust my interference was not unwarrantable nor ill-&#xD;
timed. I am sure Miss Kate forgave me."&#xD;
"Only half,"-said Kate, looking up as if she meant to&#xD;
have her question answered,-" it was not more than half&#xD;
out of good nature to me, Mr. Collingwood ?"&#xD;
"Yes, rather more," he said with a smile.&#xD;
"Weren't you afraid I would refuse, and so hurt the&#xD;
child's feelings ?"&#xD;
" A little."-                      .       .&#xD;
We had paused upon a rising ground to look back, and&#xD;
the farmhouse dell showed very fairly in the distance;&#xD;
but now we saw a figure approaching the door whom we&#xD;
all recognized at once,-indeed as Kate said afterwards,&#xD;
"it could be nobody but Miss Easy."  Mr. Rodney said&#xD;
nothing, he neither called our attention to the lady nor told&#xD;
us who it was; but as she reached the door and went in,&#xD;
among the little troop that had rushed out to meet her, his&#xD;
eye wore a look of singular brightness and pleasure; and&#xD;
so much of the glow remained when we turned again to our&#xD;
walk, that Stephanie lost patience,&#xD;
Then you would absolutely encourage uppishness !" she&#xD;
said. "Well I wouldn't !"&#xD;
"Nor I,-and therefore"- he stopped short.&#xD;
"You may just as well go on-'and therefore you&#xD;
wouldn't practise it.'-You are mistaken for once in your&#xD;
life."&#xD;
"Don't you think such people are apt to presume, Mr.&#xD;
Collingwood?" said Kate.&#xD;
"Very apt if you give them a chance. But if we meet&#xD;
the poor now and then on their own ground, they will care&#xD;

the less about attaining to ours. It is this nervous guard-&#xD;
ing of position which makes them feel looked down upon ;&#xD;
and then naturally they try for a stand where that shall&#xD;
seem less possible. The silk slipper never hurt itself by a&#xD;
step off the dais."&#xD;
"Not even into the mud ?"&#xD;
"If people cannot keep out of the mud," said Mr. Col-&#xD;

CHAPTER. XIII.&#xD;
Nay, if our wits run the wild-goose chase, I have done; for thou hast more&#xD;
of the wild-goose in one of thy wits, than I have in my whole fve.&#xD;
s1AESPEARIC.&#xD;
"   ERHAPS you remember, Kate," said Stephanie one&#xD;
morning, "-that very wise and sententious remark&#xD;
that your father niade the other day about the properties&#xD;
of mnan ?"&#xD;
"' The chief properties of man are contemplation and&#xD;
sociableness'? that was only a quotation from, More, I&#xD;
think he said."&#xD;
" Only !-well, since Mr. Howard quoted it, I suppose I&#xD;
may venture to refer to it. It struck me as particularly&#xD;
wise,-for I have been thinking that man, and of course&#xD;
woman, was made up of only one. Now don't you sup-&#xD;
pose that standing too much upon one foot may have a&#xD;
tendency to weaken the other ?"&#xD;
"Do you think of trying contemplation ?" said Kate,&#xD;
without looking up from her book,-" yes, I should think&#xD;
it quite probable."&#xD;
"I wish to goodness you might fall into somebody's&#xD;
hands who would give you an overdose of contemplation&#xD;
for once !" said Stephanie.    ~&#xD;
" Overdoses never kill," said Kate smiling,--" I should&#xD;
come out a hermit."&#xD;
" My dear, you are that already-only you don't know&#xD;
it,-the life you lead here at present by no means savours&#xD;
of dissipation."&#xD;
"I doubt if my life would, anywhere," said Kate.&#xD;
"Might savour of it, you know-just a souppona,-as&#xD;
people put a grain of sugar in gruel."&#xD;
&#xD;
J 1&#xD;
(:4&#xD;
i&#xD;
&#xD;
" I never do," said Kate,-" a grain 'of salt is to my&#xD;
liking; and no one ever found that in dissipation."&#xD;
"I declare," said Stephanie, "if you will not attend to&#xD;
my words, I will pelt you with quotations."&#xD;
"Where from ?"&#xD;
"Don't know, in the least-but you will as soon as I&#xD;
tell them to you.  How do you like this. 'The eagle&#xD;
flies alone, it is only the sheep that like company.' Are&#xD;
you going to make an eagle of yourself? one of the 'select&#xD;
few'? for I'm sure my quotation should be in the plural-&#xD;
eagles do occasionally like company."&#xD;
"You are altogether too profound for my light reading,"&#xD;
laid Kate, shutting her book. "What is all this about?  I&#xD;
thought you had been turning pirouettes on both feet, all&#xD;
your life."&#xD;
"It is all about my going to pay Mrs. Eustace'a visit."&#xD;
"What put such a thing into your head?"&#xD;
"This letter of request that I would come; and my mind&#xD;
being an easy one to make up, I shall spend all my energies&#xD;
upon my trunk, and depart to-morrow morning with your&#xD;
'father."&#xD;
To say was to do, and she went.&#xD;
We were particularly quiet after that, for Mr. Howard&#xD;
began to be a good deal away,-property elsewhere&#xD;
demanded his attention, and Glen Luna had to wait its&#xD;
turn. Yet even this repeated absence had a bright side-&#xD;
the coming back; and then, besides the pleasure of seeing&#xD;
him and hearing of the people and things he had seen,&#xD;
there was always some. interest about my father's trunk.&#xD;
The Moon shops were but so-so, and those at Wiamee still&#xD;
worse ; so we always sent elsewhere when we could; and&#xD;
Mr. Howard brought home things i. every variety. The&#xD;
long journey or the trunk gave theau a -peculiar charm.&#xD;
Never were there such spools of cotton-never were the&#xD;
various little articles of family use so well appreciated ;&#xD;
and often there came too a surprise,-a new book, a work-&#xD;
box, or a gold pen..&#xD;
Whenever Mr. Howard staid at home for a few dys,&#xD;
the improvements went on in double quick time ; for as&#xD;
Ezra "Barrington remarked, " he made the men fly round&#xD;
like shell peas." We thought some of the improvements,&#xD;

might have had another name, and felt it hard to spare&#xD;
fine branches because by and by the tree would be the&#xD;
handsomer. Iwneed we always took that promise with&#xD;
a doubt, and other innovations that were confessedly for&#xD;
use met with still less favour. A wall must cut us off in&#xD;
that direction because the cattle got into the garden ; and&#xD;
this road must be changed from its pretty winding curves&#xD;
to a direct line, because a short cut to the barn seemed&#xD;
desirable. But whenever I went that way, I quitted the&#xD;
new gravel for the old crooks, which the grass was lending&#xD;
a hand to obliterate, and followed them pertinaciously.&#xD;
Everybody laughed at me for it, but my feet were discon-&#xD;
tented else.&#xD;
One day when we were roaming the fields, and admiring&#xD;
the white promise of wild strawberries, we came to a little&#xD;
hollow that had last year been very liberal. The march of&#xD;
improvement had set its foot even there. Ezra Barrington&#xD;
with cart and oxen was dumping gravel into the very hol-&#xD;
low; and the amount of white blossoms that tried to shake&#xD;
their heads clear at the outskirts of the heap, gave a fair&#xD;
indication of the fruitless efforts that lay beneath its centre.&#xD;
My father stood complacently looking on..&#xD;
" Why papa!" exclaimed Kate-" you are filling up my&#xD;
beautiful strawberry patch !"&#xD;
"Must be filled up, my dear,-don't you see it is just in&#xD;
the course of this road i"&#xD;
"But why can't the road go round it ?" said I.&#xD;
"That would liardly do,-it would be inconvenient, and&#xD;
wouldn't look well besides."&#xD;
"I think it would look better than this."&#xD;
"Ge' 'long !" said Mr. Barrington, in a very audible&#xD;
aside to his team. "Come about! hawj-You want it&#xD;
right straight across, Squire ?-.maybe another Joad'll fill it&#xD;
up sufficient if you don't mind it's being a bit wavy. Other-&#xD;
ways it'll take three."&#xD;
" Straight across !" said my father-" there's gravel&#xD;
enough. I don't care if it takes a dozen."&#xD;
" There aren't strawberries enough," said Kate.-" Papa&#xD;
it is rather too bad !"&#xD;
"Nonsense !" said my father, " we shall have berries in&#xD;

the garden next summer,--and if we didn't the road is of&#xD;
much more importance."&#xD;
"Nobody likes to eat them betterthan you do, papa !"&#xD;
"Well I will curb my appetite for once," said Mr. How.&#xD;
ard laughing.&#xD;
The subject of country neighbours was not quite laid&#xD;
asleep, for in spite of Kate and Stephanie's precautions&#xD;
we were exposed to a visit now and then which did not&#xD;
please them,-sometimes dictated by curiosity, sometimes&#xD;
by policy. If the family of the country doctor had failed&#xD;
in attention, there would have been danger of our being&#xD;
sick under nobody knows what auspices; and the same&#xD;
might be said of our quarrels had the attorney been remiss;&#xD;
-while the proprietor of the only mill in the neighbour-&#xD;
hood probably thought that as we were putting up another&#xD;
there could be no reason why we should not be well ac-&#xD;
quainted.&#xD;
Mrs. Howard bore it all with her usual gentleness towards&#xD;
human nature 'in whatever form; but Kate found it very&#xD;
annoying, and would fain have made the visits egin and&#xD;
end at the front doof. This my father negatived with his&#xD;
usual coolness. Everybody might come that wanted to he&#xD;
said, and get all the good that eyes could take in;-as for&#xD;
being "engaged" to one person and not to another-merely&#xD;
because the one was poor and the other rich-he had no&#xD;
idea of it,-" he knew what was due to ourselves."  To do&#xD;
him justice he never put himself out of the way for anybody,&#xD;
in the least. If he didn't want to stay in the drawing-&#xD;
room he walked off into the study; and when he did stay&#xD;
it was to be silent as often as to talk. But listeners are&#xD;
always popular, and my father was soon voted the pink of&#xD;
politeness,-either physician or attorney would have at-&#xD;
tended him with pleasure.&#xD;
July was well.on its way before Stephanie returned; and&#xD;
then she came tired, grave, and rather silent,-a most un-&#xD;
usual combination for Miss Holbrook. Sleep exerted its&#xD;
restorative powers but partially; for though she talked&#xD;
fast enough all breakfast time, afterwards, when we took&#xD;
our work into the room where she was unpacking, Stephanie&#xD;
seemed to plunge as deep into the recesses of he nid as&#xD;
of her trunks,-and brought forth much less.&#xD;

"What are you thinking about ?" Kate said at length.&#xD;
. " I was reflecting upon the amount of things that a visit&#xD;
may do and undo-just; look at this dress! who would&#xD;
suppose it had ever been fit to put on !"&#xD;
"Why anybody that knew anything about dresses and&#xD;
-     wearing them. But what has the visit done? this is just&#xD;
the undoing."&#xD;
But Stephanie only made another plunge. "It must be&#xD;
yourself!" said Kate laughing-" I never saw you in such&#xD;
good order before,-you have excessively the air of having&#xD;
just come from the ruffle woman. I didn't know that&#xD;
Mrs. Eustace made such liberal use of starch and fluting-&#xD;
irons."&#xD;
"If it's all the same to you," said Stephanie with some-&#xD;
thing of her own manner, "I'd as leave not be exasperated."&#xD;
"I would exasperate you in a minute," said Kate still&#xD;
laughing, "if I only knew how-at present I have not the&#xD;
slightest idea who you are. Just look out of the window&#xD;
and say that you feel at home or I shall conclude you' are&#xD;
somebody else."&#xD;
"Wilder conclusions than that have come true, and my&#xD;
eyes have at present full occupation."&#xD;
"But Stephanie," I said, "it is so lovely out,-it's a&#xD;
shame not to look at such flowers and sunshine,-we&#xD;
think everything is prettier than it ever was."&#xD;
"Very likely"-said Stephanie,-" I can answer for&#xD;
Kate ;-but Grace my dear, I do not wish to have my&#xD;
fancy entangled among flowers and sunshine."&#xD;
"Why not?"&#xD;
" Because I have made up my mind to run a race with a&#xD;
snow-ball-and in those latitudes you know, such things&#xD;
don't flourish."&#xD;
"I wonder which foot you are on now ?" said Kate.&#xD;
",Why do you talk such nonsense ?"&#xD;
" Truth must be spoken, if it is nonsense."&#xD;
" Do separate them," said Kate a little impatiently, "and&#xD;
give us the short cut of this rigmarole. What are you&#xD;
talking about ?"&#xD;
"Short cut ?" said Stephanie-" it's a hard knot, or like&#xD;
to be; and as to talking-I was alluding with sufficient&#xD;
distinctness to .a person I thought you might remember."&#xD;
&#xD;
If-&#xD;
&#xD;
And locking tie empty trunk, Miss Holbrook pushed it,&#xD;
from her and opened a full one.&#xD;
Kate laid down her work.&#xD;
"I never saw you serious in my life, so it's no wonder&#xD;
if I am puzzled. You don't wean that you intend to marry&#xD;
Mr. Freeman."&#xD;
"Precisely-if you like that name better,-  prefer his&#xD;
appellation of Snowball."&#xD;
"How can you be so absurd !" said Kate, laughing iti&#xD;
spite of herself at the cool demureness of the reply.&#xD;
"My gracious me !" said Stephanie as with an emphatic&#xD;
fling of a pair of shoes into the corner, she crossed her&#xD;
arms and looked up at us, "you're enough to try more&#xD;
patience than I've got ! Here am I making revelations&#xD;
that ought to be a la rouge I suppose, and you won't believe&#xD;
them. Don't I tell you I'm going to marry that man?&#xD;
Was nobody ever married before ?"&#xD;
"But not to Mr. Freeman," said Kate-with a most&#xD;
innocent rendering of her thoughts into plain English., _f&#xD;
"Not to Mr. Freeman !-Probably not--your piac&#xD;
information are startling. I suppose there must be  '&#xD;
time-even for Mr. Freeman. You see the 'thtarths'&#xD;
melted him, as Henderson says."&#xD;
"But what has melted you ?" said Kate.&#xD;
" I don't profess to be an iceberg," said Stephanie dryly&#xD;
and turning to her trunk. .Then changing her tone she&#xD;
added,&#xD;
"And it isn't desirable you know that, we should both&#xD;
be of 'the melting mood', or we might run away together.&#xD;
Now don't look so horrified either of you. Kate-do you&#xD;
perceive how completely unstarched-I am ?"&#xD;
Kate smiled a little but with a -rather grave face, and&#xD;
went on taking stitches in the most abstracted manner;&#xD;
while Stephanie as half in argument with her silence con-&#xD;
tinued.&#xD;
"What is it to any one if I like snow-balls? I don't say&#xD;
they're as striking. as epaulettes or is aspiring as eagles&#xD;
And by the way, how is his falconship ?"&#xD;
"I didn't know eagles were falcons," said I.&#xD;
"Belong to the Falconidae, don't they ? or IPve forgotten&#xD;
all about ornithology. But yod~iknw, Kate, I never was5&#xD;

"1Well," said Kate, "as I do not know Mr. Freeman I&#xD;
cannot congratulate you."&#xD;
"And knowing me you cannot congratulate him-I'll&#xD;
forgive you all that if you'll do something else. Katydid&#xD;
-just be Katydo for once, and tell Mr. Howard what I&#xD;
have told you. I really cannot tell him myself, for he'd cer-&#xD;
tainly pour out some of the prophecies he used to make&#xD;
about the poor Captain; and I'm afraid I should pass all&#xD;
bounds of decorum if he told me my snow-ball would&#xD;
"never set fire to anything."&#xD;
"O Stephanie !'" Kate said-then checking herself she&#xD;
folded up her work, and sticking the needle in it with un-&#xD;
usual care, remarked,&#xD;
"I will do all you wish me to."&#xD;
"That was not what you were going to say ?"&#xD;
"Px cNo."&#xD;
"Tell me that."&#xD;
KIt's better unsaid.-Is there anything else for me to&#xD;
tell papa."&#xD;
"Nothing,-only make him understand all this clearly,&#xD;
so that he won't come down upon me with any questions;-&#xD;
my self-possession extends but to ordinary occasions. And&#xD;
now Kate," she said springing off the floor and laying her&#xD;
hands on Kate's shoulders, "I know every word you were&#xD;
going to say, and you are altogether right and partly wrong,&#xD;
-which is a charming combination. There, now go, both&#xD;
of you, and let me finish this job without the distraction&#xD;
of your eyelashes-which make me feel melancholy. Pre-&#xD;
liminary 'tears and white muslin' are more than I bargained&#xD;
for."&#xD;
When Kate and I had talked over this strange conversa-&#xD;
tion with a mingling of sorrow and wonder, we went into&#xD;
n rsHoward's room and gave her the benefit of it. My&#xD;
* .   lhe's comments were deferred for a day or two as he was&#xD;
fidifr home.&#xD;

"No I don't," he replied, facing round upon late as if he&#xD;
wondered how the subject got into her head.&#xD;
"Then I have the pleasure of informing you," said Kate&#xD;
with a laugh at the gravity with which she was'eyed.&#xD;
'"I have not the pleasure of hearing," said Mr. Howard&#xD;
knitting his brows.&#xD;
"But you must hear and be pleased too, papa."&#xD;
"With what ?"&#xD;
" Why-with this news I am telling you."&#xD;
".Humph-" said my father. "Who set that ball a&#xD;
rolling?"&#xD;
" Mr. Freeman in the first place, I suppose, papa."&#xD;
My father looked at the demure eyes that met his, as if&#xD;
he would like to find fault with something,-he couldn't&#xD;
with them.&#xD;
"Freeman!" he said turning round to his former position..&#xD;
"Marry that man ! no indeed she shall not."&#xD;
"Why Mr. Howard !" said my stepmother, "what an&#xD;
you possibly mea"?&#xD;
"Just that," said my father coolly.&#xD;
"But you have no right to say so,--and it wouldn't do&#xD;
any good besides."&#xD;
" What can you possibly mean now? No right, and I&#xD;
her guardian ! No good to forbid her marrying a man with&#xD;
more inches than ideas !"&#xD;
"No good at all-for she'd marry him when she came of&#xD;
age or run away before. And as to the right, as your friend=&#xD;
the Chancellor used to say 'you may have 'it in law but not&#xD;
in equity,'-if she really likes the man and he is unobjec-&#xD;
tionable.'&#xD;
"I tell you he isn't unobjectionable. I never heara4&#xD;
harm of him, 'but he's a nonentity."&#xD;
That is only a negative objection," said mystepmothe&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"My objections are positive enough," said my father.&#xD;
"N ow my dear Mr. Howard, do be reasonable.' Make&#xD;
inquiries about Mrs Freeman, and if he is good and respect. '&#xD;

even know where the man lives,-and I'm sure it is not my&#xD;
fault if we have any mutual friends."&#xD;
"Go over to the Moon and see Captain De Camp," said.&#xD;
Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
"Yes I suppose I may as well go to the Moon as any.&#xD;
where. But De Camp-he hasn't got another furlough, has&#xD;
he ?"&#xD;
"O yes papa," said I,-" he has been here twice."&#xD;
"The deuce he has!.-I am well set to work, certainly."&#xD;
"But papa!" exclaimed Kate as he reached the door,&#xD;
"you mustn't tell Captain De Camp why you want to&#xD;
know about Mr. Freeman,-you must be very careful."&#xD;
"I shall say first that Stephanie's going to marry him,--&#xD;
after which I shall inquire if he is a respectable man. Do&#xD;
you think I am a fool, Kate ?"&#xD;
"No papa, but"-.-...,&#xD;
"Well my dear, if I can't deal with Captain De Camp it'sa&#xD;
a pity. You needn't wait dinner for me-i shall stop at&#xD;
the Bird's Nest."&#xD;
"But stay," said Mrs. Howard-" you must find out&#xD;
where Mr. Freeman is, as well as who he is,-he may be&#xD;
staying at the Moon again, and then you must call upon.&#xD;
him and invite him over here."&#xD;
My father stopped and stood irresolute.&#xD;
"No doubt he is there !-it's the rallying point for all the&#xD;
satellites of this region. I wish he was in Egypt !"&#xD;
There wassuch a mixture of the undecided, the ludicrous,&#xD;
and the dismayed in my father's face, that we all burst out&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
"Take care or that child will hear you," he said.&#xD;
"She has gone out," said my stepmother. ",But why&#xD;
does this annoy you so ?  If it were Kate, indeed"-&#xD;
"Kate !"interrupted my father,-and as if words could&#xD;
no further go, he quitted the room and left us to laugh at&#xD;
} our leisure.&#xD;

'turned.&#xD;
" Well!" he said as he sat down, "I ought to have come&#xD;
back luminous after such a sojourn in that precious planet ! ~&#xD;
"Did you see Miss Caffery, papa ?" said I.&#xD;

DOLLARS AND CENTS.            123&#xD;

"Good Miss Caffery !" said my father, his face unbend.&#xD;
ing, "she half persuaded me out of my ill-humour,-half&#xD;
convinced me that if people could be happy without any&#xD;
thing to make them so, it was none of my business.&#xD;
"And what said Miss Bain?" inquired my stepmother&#xD;
"Miss Bain said that the very best thing you-g people&#xD;
could do-at least," said my father checking himself, " she&#xD;
said sundry foolish things which I need not repeat. Do&#xD;
we have any tea to-night ?-or are we to live upon laugh.&#xD;
ing ?"&#xD;
"But papa," said Kate composing her face, "you haven't&#xD;
told us about Mr. Freeman ?"&#xD;
" What about Mr. Freeman ?"&#xD;
"Why all about him,-what you have heard and seen.&#xD;
Stephanie will come down when the tea-bell rings, and then&#xD;
you will have no chance."%&#xD;
" Well," said Mr. Howard again and reseating himself,&#xD;
"I went to the Moon and I saw Captain De Camp-and&#xD;
Mr. Freeman---of course. And Mr. Freeman had the&#xD;
sense (which I didn't expect) to take himself off. I reckon&#xD;
he was afraid of me. And the Captain was unusually lucid&#xD;
in his answers. So I learned without much difficulty&#xD;
Mr. Freeman has survived a precious childhood; t&#xD;
rests his knowledge of the State's prison solely on inform&#xD;
tion and belief; Ithat roguery and riches are in the future&#xD;
tense with him; ahd that to hinder as much as possible&#xD;
his pursuit after both, 'he has fallen desperately in love&#xD;
with Miss Holbrook-quite head and ears, Iassure you sir.'&#xD;
If I could imitate the concluding laugh, my dear, you would&#xD;
have a fair presentation of the whole. Kate and Grace&#xD;

Think of that poor child upstairs, and don't take the edge&#xD;
off. her happiness."&#xD;
"Tut ! my dear-if the sight of Mr. Freeman don't&#xD;
take the edge off it's quite out of my reach. But poor&#xD;
child ! as you say;' and she's a good child too; and I love&#xD;
her for her father's sake as well as her own."&#xD;
So he did. No remark that was even doubtful in its&#xD;
bearing was suffered to reach Stephanie's ear ; and there&#xD;
was a kindness in his tone that brought tears to her eyes,&#xD;
when he said,&#xD;
"Well Stephanie my dear, your old friend Mr. Freeman&#xD;
dines with us to-morrow, so I hope you will make yourself.&#xD;
very agreeable. And by the way," he added, " I told the&#xD;
two ladies that we should be glad of their company."&#xD;
"That is just what we were wishing !" said Kate and I'&#xD;
together.&#xD;
It so happened that Caddie Me In-the only specimen&#xD;
of womankind who, then inhabited our kitchen-knew about&#xD;
as much of the mysteries of flour and spice, as she did of'&#xD;
botany and Epicurus. Therefore on that eventful morning,&#xD;
which, as Stephanie expressed it, "would bring a coolness&#xD;
among the members of our family," Kate and I rolled up&#xD;
durasleeves and "went but," as the Scotch say ; for we had&#xD;
declared that Stephanie should play visiter, and see neither&#xD;
Charlotte nor Souffl6 till they were on the table.&#xD;
I was 'busily engaged before the kitchen window, intro-&#xD;
dcucing ladies' fingers to the most intimate acquaintance.&#xD;
with the Charlotte mould ; and Kate in the shade of the&#xD;
wall sat quietly mixing an odoriferous compound ; when&#xD;
a quick, frosty step made me look up,-and there, just be-,&#xD;
fore my open window, stood Squire Brown. Since our first.&#xD;
coming to Glen Luna the Browns had sent frequent mes-'&#xD;
sages that they meant to call upon us, but themselves never,&#xD;
camer-this was the first time a Brown foot had approached&#xD;
ourlhouse.&#xD;
The present apparition was a little old man-or he&#xD;
would have been old if he hadn't been jolly-whose roll-&#xD;
about body sat rather insecurely upon his little roll-about&#xD;
legs ; whose coat was snuff-colour, and his trousers a compro-&#xD;
mise between pantaloons and small-clothes. His hat was&#xD;
broad-brimmed, a whip'flourished in one hand, and his little&#xD;

sharp eyes were erideavouring to see from the bright open&#xD;
air into our kitchenr-of course dark by contrast. Perhaps&#xD;
an occasional waft of maraschino may have quickened these&#xD;
efforts.&#xD;
"Ah, my dear !" said the Squire, "how d'ye do ?-busy,&#xD;
eh ?"-here he gave himself a little twist and peered more&#xD;
anxiously than ever,-" how's your father? well, eh? and&#xD;
the rest of you ?"&#xD;
"Quite well sir, I thank you."&#xD;
"Well my dear," with a turn of the head that convinced&#xD;
me he knew where Kate sat and was trying to see her; "well&#xD;
my dear, has your father got through haying ?"&#xD;
"O yes sir, long ago."&#xD;
Long ago ! eh,--well that's good. D'ye think now-.&#xD;
you're his data ain't you ?"&#xD;
"Yes sir."&#xD;
Dye think your father could let me have Mr. Barring-&#xD;
ton for a couple of days? I've got a field of grass down&#xD;
and my man's taken sick."&#xD;
"I don't know sir, I'll tell him when he comes home."&#xD;
"He's out, is he?"&#xD;
"Ye sir.&#xD;
"D'ye know where he's gone my dear, eh?"&#xD;
"To Mr. Collingwood's I believe, sir."&#xD;
Farmer Collingwood's-.that's out' of my way," said the&#xD;
Squire, again nearly oversetting ray gravity and his own,---&#xD;
"fine young man his son'is, ain't he ? Well my dear you'll.&#xD;
tell him--d'ye know my name now, eh ?"&#xD;
"I believe so, sir.&#xD;
Yes I guess so too-and harkye, my datas have been&#xD;
coming down here this long time,,only it's 'so far you see,&#xD;
they haven't made it out;-but they'll come very soon.&#xD;
Good-day my dear."&#xD;
Howawelaughed!&#xD;
"He didn't see you Kate, after all !"&#xD;
"No; but I wonder what he means by 'so far,'-I'm&#xD;
sure they go ofteiai enough, to the Moon, which is much&#xD;
further."&#xD;
"Ifthey're like him we needn't care," said I,-" dido&#xD;

ask them here to-day,-it would have been only polite."&#xD;
"He did: I heard him telling mamma this morning."&#xD;
"Then I haven't made enough soufe!" said Kate despair-&#xD;
ingly&#xD;
90they're not coming to dinner-only to tea and ice-&#xD;
cream."&#xD;
"Ice-ream ?" said Stephanie-" that sounds pleasant.&#xD;
Do I look quite fiery ?" she added advancing into the kitchen.&#xD;
We both turned and looked at her.&#xD;
Pretty, very pretty she always was, and that day espe-&#xD;
cially. Excitement had given even neck and arms a slight&#xD;
reflection of her pink dress, but the prevailing tint was kept&#xD;
down by her gracefully arranged black hair; while in her&#xD;
eyes the expression-half dance half defiance-which usual-&#xD;
ly shone there, was softened by other feelings-the new&#xD;
and the timid. I even fancied that her eyelashes were&#xD;
wet, and that tears lay hid behind them as she returned our&#xD;
earnest gaze.&#xD;
earWell Katie, well Gracie," she said at last, "what are&#xD;
you thinking of?"&#xD;
I saw the sigh that might not be heard, as Kate answered,&#xD;
"I was thinking of you dear,-how nice you look !"&#xD;
"Nice !-And not fiery ?"&#xD;
"Not a bit."&#xD;
"And do you say so too, Gracie ?"&#xD;
"I don't know-I was thinking your neighbourhood might&#xD;
be pleasant to-to anything very cold," said I inexplicitly.&#xD;
Stephanie laughed, and saying "she wasn't wanted in the&#xD;
kitchen, then," she left us.&#xD;

CowPER. (Horace.)&#xD;
&#xD;
W   ELL might my father say "Good Miss Caffery !"-our&#xD;
hearts echoed it many times in the course of that&#xD;
afternoon. The mere sight of her would have soothed&#xD;
most people; and her white dress, so delicately ruffled,&#xD;
was enough to unruffle every one else. Her tone of voice&#xD;
too was so pleasant, so feelingly gentle, that .one was&#xD;
touched as well as interested by what she said. Every&#xD;
word and look spoke the eminent humanity of her nature,&#xD;
but said as plainly that it was humanity purified. I never&#xD;
saw her now without thinking of Mr. Collingwood's words,&#xD;
"a lovely and well-developed christian character,"-they&#xD;
helped me to understand what before I had only felt. It&#xD;
was like being shown the secret spring whence came some&#xD;
indefinable freshness of the atmosphere.&#xD;
I do not mean that we were all out of humour on that&#xD;
eventful day, but there was some embarrassment or anxiety&#xD;
with each one-now and then with my father a little&#xD;
moodiness. But Miss Easy seemed to smooth away&#xD;
everything,-no one could be in such a ray without for the&#xD;
time at least, assuming its colour.&#xD;
Miss Avarintha was as usual peculiar: very unwilling&#xD;
that things should go on quietly, and not having the least&#xD;
idea how to put her finger in with judgment. Mrs. De&#xD;
Camp was fully of talk ;, the Captain very bland and benign;&#xD;
and Mr. Freeman (when he. thought my father was think-&#xD;
ing of some one else) very happy and comfortable. He&#xD;

yond all disturbance from trifles; but Miss Holbrook her-&#xD;
self was well disposed to give the aforesaid finger a rap&#xD;
over the knuckles every time she encountered it; and if&#xD;
she sometimes forbore in deference to Kate's look of re-&#xD;
proof, it was only to utter an energetic aside about "the&#xD;
Bain of her life."&#xD;
In the evening when my father and I were walking&#xD;
about and joining everybody by turns for the sake of vari-&#xD;
ety, Mr. Collingwood came in; and like us took a promenade&#xD;
ticket. Miss Bain had just crossed the room to make an&#xD;
attack.&#xD;
"Where do you reside now sir ?" she began. "At least&#xD;
I don't mean now-of course you are at the Moon and&#xD;
likely there to continue, I suppose, for some time-but&#xD;
where have you been residing ?"&#xD;
"Really ma'am," said Mr. Freeman returning from the&#xD;
antipodes, "I can hardly say,-I did live in New York&#xD;
until the last six months."&#xD;
"And since then?"&#xD;
"Since then," he replied, laughing partly at his question-&#xD;
er and partly at what he was going to say,-.-" Since then&#xD;
ma'am, my head' has been in the condition of a family in&#xD;
moving time-the house in one place and the furniture in&#xD;
another,-of course my existence has been somewhat com-&#xD;
pounded and intermediate."&#xD;
"'Who of all the world should meet&#xD;
One summer's day, but Love and Reason,'&#xD;
said my father with a smile.  "That moving state, Mr.&#xD;
Freeman, always brings two evils,-the house wants settling&#xD;
and the furniture wants mending."&#xD;
" I wish no delay about either, sir," said Mr. Freeman&#xD;
with great frankness.&#xD;
"But Mr. Howard," said Miss Bain insinuatingly, " that&#xD;
is a lady's province,-you would not expect a gentleman&#xD;
to undertake it."&#xD;
"My expectations are but limited, ma'am, from either&#xD;
man or woman."&#xD;
"What a singular idea !" said Miss Bain.&#xD;
" You will find, it a very plural idea," said my fathe&#xD;

"Mr. Freeman-I can't ask you of course. What do you&#xD;
say, Mr. Rodney ?"&#xD;
"Not quite that, sir."&#xD;
"See there now, what it is to want experience !" said&#xD;
my father, "where's the use of expecting uncertainties ?"&#xD;
"Isn't there an expectation of hope ?"&#xD;
"And a disappointment of hope too, I'm thinking.&#xD;
You'll come out of that delusion my good sir, unless your&#xD;
charitable eye-glass gains all the magnifying power that&#xD;
your mental eye will lose."            J.&#xD;
"And what is to hinder ?" said Mr. Rodney smiling,-&#xD;
"why shouldn't it, Mr. Howard?  Charity is not so much&#xD;
needed till delusion fails."&#xD;
"I'm sure I can't tell why it shouldn't-I don't know&#xD;
how it is with you, but there's a considerable degree of&#xD;
perverseness that will always hinder it in me."&#xD;
"1Grains of allowance, sir," said Miss Bain, picking up&#xD;
an end of the subject.&#xD;
" And a little soil for them to grow in. I've thrown out&#xD;
plenty of 'grains of allowance' that came to nothing,-so&#xD;
you see my stock has decreased. I don't mean to expect&#xD;
anything from anybody in future."&#xD;
"1Except from that one person in the window ?" said Miss&#xD;
Easy smiling. "Yes sir, you have been looking at her the&#xD;
whole time to disprove your words, yes."&#xD;
"Poh,"-said Mr. Howard, laughing and bringing his&#xD;
eyes back.  "I beg your pardon Miss Easy, but some-&#xD;
times one knows what one cannot see. 'Love all, trust a&#xD;
few."'&#xD;
"With a little trust to the all, and a very special love to&#xD;
the few," said Mr. Rodney~ smiling, "I will subscribe to&#xD;
that, Mr. Howard."&#xD;
My father smiled too, a little-half to himself, as it&#xD;
were.&#xD;
"I don't know whether I must put her among the few,"&#xD;
he said --" I suppose in reality Kate is just like that little&#xD;
intruder over there.  Now Grace thinks all the world of&#xD;
that cat, and yet would not for all the world trust her near&#xD;
the open closet."&#xD;
"not it's her nature, papa," I said.&#xD;

"But it isn't Kate's."-&#xD;
"What ?" said my father laughing-" to steal into the&#xD;
pantry ? Which one is the cat going to now, Gracie ?"}&#xD;
I turned round to watch her progress. She took a good&#xD;
look at me and then marched off towards the window.&#xD;
"Does she like Miss Kate better than you ?" said Mr.&#xD;
Coflingwood smiling.&#xD;
" Ono, but she wants to get. on somebody's lap,--if I&#xD;
had been sitting still she would have come right to me.=&#xD;
She likes Kate very much though."                              A&#xD;
"How perfectly graceful!" said Captain De Camp, waving-&#xD;
his hand as he surveyed the advancing felina; "there can-&#xD;
not be anything more easy and natural than a cat's motions&#xD;
-every one of them." And dovetailing two fingers into&#xD;
the breast of his closely buttoned coat, he looked on com-&#xD;
placently-.&#xD;
Purrer-purrer seated herself in front of Kate, winked&#xD;
once or txice byr way of recognition, turned her head,&#xD;
winked once at me, and then with a light spring she reached&#xD;
the desired resting-place.&#xD;
"My dear Kate !" said Miss Bain in an earnest voice,&#xD;
and walking towards the scene of action, "how can you{&#xD;
bear that creature !"&#xD;
"Why I like her very much, ma'am," said Kate, while&#xD;
she stroked the pleased little pussy.&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood and I involuntarily approached the&#xD;
window-.&#xD;
"But you shouldn't like her-I can't bear to see you&#xD;
waste your young affections on cats."&#xD;
Kate smiled-" I should not give it that name Miss-&#xD;
Avarintha,-mayn't we apply to one sort of charity what&#xD;
Bunyan says of the other?&#xD;
' A man there was, (though some did count him mad,)&#xD;
The more he cast away, the more he had.'n&#xD;
" Charity !" said Miss Bain-" you are getting very, far&#xD;
from the cat."&#xD;
"And into most classical regions," said the Captain&#xD;
laughing-" No wonder the cat don't dare to follow'!"&#xD;
" Well !" said Kate, looking up with a mingling of dis-&#xD;
pleasure at his and trust in her own position, so bright that&#xD;

&#xD;
it quite dazzled the Captain; "and how are they unclassi-&#xD;
cal? or contemptible sir ?"&#xD;
"Contemptible !" said the Captain,-" I really did not&#xD;
mean to go quite so far; but you know Bunyan himself&#xD;
was a very low man."&#xD;
"And therefore his work, being what it is, stands all the&#xD;
higher."&#xD;
"But how is it classical, Miss Kate ?" said Mr. Colling-&#xD;
wood.&#xD;
"I cannot undertake to prove my assertion as well as&#xD;
defend it," she said laughing and colouring,-"1 suppose&#xD;
one of the things Sir Thomas More would have said&#xD;
' women had better not do,' may be to argue with superior&#xD;
information. I refer you and Captain De Camp to Macau-&#xD;
lay, Mr. Collingwood, and you can dispute the point with&#xD;
him at your leisure."&#xD;
"Which is one of the things men had better not do,"&#xD;
said he smiling.&#xD;
"But just see you all this time petting the cat !" said&#xD;
Miss Bain,-" wasting your affections, as I say."&#xD;
"0," said Kate, "I don't think one has a measured&#xD;
amount, which must lose in depth what it gains in&#xD;
breadth."&#xD;
"Nor I."-&#xD;
"My dear Mr. Rodney," said Miss Bain, "what can you&#xD;
possibly know of- the matter ?. Bless me, I ought to know&#xD;
a little about cats ! my aunt had thirty of them. Now&#xD;
what do you think of that ?"&#xD;
"I should think she kept no dogs."&#xD;
"And I that she had no mice," said Kate.&#xD;
"Why Miss Avarintha," said I, "her house must have&#xD;
been like the one in the fairy-tile, where the two green-,&#xD;
eyed cats kept watch over the princess."&#xD;
"And the eight and twenty relieved guard I suppose,&#xD;
said the Captain laughing.&#xD;
"Bless me !" was all the comment upon this classical&#xD;
allusion. "Bat why don't you have prettier pets ?-a&#xD;
canary or chickens ? I like to see a lady encompassed by&#xD;
chickens."&#xD;
  "Not in the house ?" said Kate smiling-" and I have no&#xD;
time for canaries and like cats better."&#xD;

needn't smile, Mr. Rodney,-it's true."&#xD;
"My smile meant no contradiction, ma'am."&#xD;
"It's not a good thing, in my judgment," said the lady&#xD;
with a new interpretation and answer. "Do tell me now&#xD;
Kate-Miss Stephanie-I've seen so little of her-is she&#xD;
always of your mind? or has she tastes of her owni' .&#xD;
"Of her own," said Kate, trying hard not to smile.&#xD;
"And have you no tastes of your own, Miss Gracie ?"&#xD;
said Mr. Collingwood smiling quite.&#xD;
"Indeed she has," said Kate.&#xD;
"So I thought."&#xD;
"Take care," said Miss Bain, "this is a dangerous at-&#xD;
mosphere,---a person cannot remain in it long and be dis-&#xD;
similar."&#xD;
"I'm sure that is a blessing to society," said the Captain&#xD;
bowing.   " But Miss Howard, speaking of tastes-is it&#xD;
permitted to ask what one renders this ice-cream so very&#xD;
delicious ?"&#xD;
"I believe,--nothing very uncommon is it ?"&#xD;
" Uncommon on our side of the lake. Henderson and I&#xD;
were trying to pronounce upon the flavour of Mrs. Shel-&#xD;
ton's, and we decided .that it 'wath pomatum' Miss. Kate,"&#xD;
said the Captain laughing.&#xD;
" Pomatum!" exclaimed Miss Bain,-"what a dreadful&#xD;
idea! You don't really mean Captain De Camp that Mrs.&#xD;
Shelton flavours ice-cream with pomatum ?"&#xD;
"Not at all, .ma'am,-I only mean that this was as near&#xD;
as we could come to it."&#xD;
"I should think it would have affected you most un-&#xD;
pleasantly !"&#xD;
The Captain's present affection was quite ecstatic.&#xD;
"O that was only because gentlemen don't know things&#xD;
by their right names," said Kate.&#xD;
"Pretty sweeping charge that, against 'superior infor..&#xD;
nation' !" said Mr. Rodney.&#xD;

"I heard of a gentleman once," said Kate, -"who asked&#xD;
a lady if her blancmange was flavoured with eye-water."&#xD;
"That is a good idea !" said the Captain,-" I will in-&#xD;
quire about- the pomatum."&#xD;
But Kate disapproved that with a very decided little&#xD;
shake of her head.&#xD;
"Why not, Miss Kate ?" said Mr. Collingwood smiling,&#xD;
-" how are men to learn if they may not ask questions ?"&#xD;
"They may-if they will only ask in the right way,-&#xD;
and when they really need information," she said with a&#xD;
look that half applied her words. "But the gentleman I&#xD;
referred to transgressed the first rule,-he should have in-&#xD;
quired simply what the flavour was. I hold that it isn't&#xD;
right to suggest disagreeable ideas to people."&#xD;
"But," said Captain De Camp, "what are 'disagreeable&#xD;
ideas' ?-for instance," he added laughing, "is pomatum&#xD;
reprehensible ?&#xD;
.. "Very decidedly, if applied to ice-cream that I am eat-&#xD;
ing ;-if it is only indefinite ice that I never saw, it does&#xD;
not so much matter."&#xD;
"But don't you think Katie-" said I--&#xD;
" What?".&#xD;
"Yes let's have your opinion on the pomatum question,&#xD;
Miss Grace," said the Captain.&#xD;
" Not much of an opinion sir, but I was thinking it&#xD;
wouldn't be pleasant to have disagreeable things said even&#xD;
about other ice-cream, for one might get such an associa-&#xD;
tion with it in general. I shouldn't want to think of po-&#xD;
matum every time I eat ice."&#xD;
"Nor I, I'm sure !" said the Captain laughing.  "Your&#xD;
remark is quite just, Miss Grace, and proves what your&#xD;
sister said that you do not always think alike."&#xD;
"I only said it did not matter so much," said Kate.&#xD;
"But we do always think alike !" I said,-"only our&#xD;
tastes are a little different sometimes."&#xD;
"You are drawing very nice distinctions, Miss Gracie,"&#xD;
said Mr. Collingwqod while the Captain laughed.&#xD;
"Distinctions about what ?" said Stephanie,-coming to-&#xD;

"Dividing them off? In which class do you put this&#xD;
interminable noise of katydids? I maintain that nobody&#xD;
can like it, and Miss Easy maintains that she does."&#xD;
"Ah ?" said the Captain.&#xD;
"But where have you put Mr. Freeman ?" said Miss&#xD;
Bain. " Where is he ?"&#xD;
" I'm sure I don't know, ma'an," said Stephanie,-" Mr.&#xD;
Freeman is not under my thumb to put anywhere. If he&#xD;
were, he would find himself among things disagreeable."&#xD;
"Why my dear Miss Holbrook !" said Miss Avarintha,&#xD;
while Stephanie enforced her words by a slight pinch on the&#xD;
back of Kate's neck.&#xD;
" He is talking to my mother," said Captain De Camp,&#xD;
"but I suppose there is such a class as things agreeabler,&#xD;
Miss Kate?  Freeman! face about, will you !&#xD;
" Now," continued the Captain, "I am going to try how&#xD;
much he knows about names."&#xD;
" Come up and be questioned Mr. Freeman," said Mr.&#xD;
Collingwood as he smilingly made room for him in the&#xD;
circle.&#xD;
" Whether I will or no?"&#xD;
" Whether you will or no-and by a gentleman whose&#xD;
knowledge of the subject dates back some fifteen minutes."&#xD;
" But take some cake first (by your leave, Miss How-&#xD;
ard,)" said the Captain handing him the basket. "Now&#xD;
what is it flavoured with ?"&#xD;
" This ring ?" said Mr. Freeman, as after taking a small&#xD;
bite he collared a digit with the remainder.&#xD;
"It isn't a ring, Mr. Freeman," I said.&#xD;
"1What is it then ?"&#xD;
"It's a jumble, sir."&#xD;
"Well that is certainly making a jumble of plain En-&#xD;
glish! I advise you to remodel your cook-book, Miss&#xD;
Grace."&#xD;
The "cook-book" was lost upon the gentlemen, but Kate,&#xD;
And Stephanie were fain to pat the cat.&#xD;
"But what does it taste of?" said the Captain.&#xD;
"Sugar--" said Mr. Freeman, as if he felt upon sure&#xD;
ground.&#xD;
"Bless my spurs !" said the Captain,-" but what else ?"&#xD;
sureue I don't know-the thing I like best about it, is&#xD;
&#xD;
the sugar. Yes, I think there is'something else-something&#xD;
I have tasted before too ;-it is isinglass !" said Mr. Free-&#xD;
man decidedly.&#xD;
There was no standing this,-the Captain led off and we&#xD;
all had to follow. Even Mr. Howard and the astonished&#xD;
mover of our mirth joined in, they knew not why.&#xD;
"Captain De Camp has been testing Miss Howard's&#xD;
opinion that men don't know everything," said Mr. Rodney.&#xD;
" Is that all you're laughing at !" said my father,--" bless&#xD;
me, I am told that every day of my life."&#xD;
"O papa !" said Kate.&#xD;
" I didn't say by whom, Katie,-maybe it's myself."&#xD;
" But I don't understand," said Miss Easy's soft voice.&#xD;
"Yes sir, who is it that does not know everything ?"&#xD;
"It's an abstract proposition proved upon me, I believe&#xD;
ma'am," said Mr. Freeman.&#xD;
" Your lesson is but a quarter of an hour behind ours,"&#xD;
said Mr. Rodney.&#xD;
"Mr. Freeman," said Kate getting up and opening a&#xD;
cabinet, "did you ever see these shells?--papa would tell&#xD;
you that they are worth the trouble."&#xD;
" And will you tell me the same thing, Miss Kate ?" said&#xD;
the Captain.&#xD;
" No sir," she answered with light gravity, "I know too&#xD;
little of them and of you,-your taste may not lie that way."&#xD;
The taste of several persons seemed to lie that way just&#xD;
then, and we had. full occupation as show-women. Kate&#xD;
laughingly set out a cold collation of ".olives" and "pigs,"&#xD;
"poached eggs" and "thorny woodcocks," which Captain&#xD;
De Camp immediately declared he should choose,-" he&#xD;
went in. for utility."&#xD;
"What do you say to a 'weaver's shuttle' then ?" said&#xD;
Stephanie,-" don't you call that useful ?"&#xD;
"Not to my taste, Miss Holbrook."&#xD;
"Well here is the ear of King Midas,-and more useful&#xD;
still"-&#xD;
But Kate took the shell out of her hand with a glance&#xD;
which Stephanie did not see fit to disregard.&#xD;
"What is that, Miss Kate ?"&#xD;
" This. one ?" said she taking up another. "It is Venus's&#xD;
comb,--don't you wish to inspect such an antique ?"&#xD;

"By no means !" he said' with a gesture of refusal--&#xD;
"everything shows best in its proper place."&#xD;
The shell was immediately restored to the cabinet, and&#xD;
Kate bestowed her attention upon Mr. Freeman.&#xD;
" Here is a perspective shell for you, Mr. Rodney," I&#xD;
said,-" and this Argonaut-isn't it beautiful? '&#xD;
"I wonder where all the shells get their names !" said&#xD;
Captain De Camp,-"such as this for instance."-&#xD;
" Why this must have been called after the Argonauts"&#xD;
-I said,-" because it is such a good sailor."-&#xD;
"The Argonauts !" said Captain De Camp. "And pray&#xD;
who were they, Miss Grace ?"&#xD;
"Why you know, sir," said I, as if he wanted to find out&#xD;
the depth of my knowledge-" they were the men that&#xD;
rowed the Argo-the ship in which Jason went after the&#xD;
Golden Fleece."&#xD;
"I don't know anything about it,"-said the Captain&#xD;
frankly,-" I am ashamed to say, Miss Grace, that I have&#xD;
never read those old stories."&#xD;
"Papa told me,"-I said.&#xD;
"But what is this shell ?" said he helping himself. " "Miss&#xD;
Holbrook this is the one you were going to show me."&#xD;
"That's the most useful shell in the case," remarked Mr.&#xD;
Freeman.&#xD;
" Well it's one of the prettiest. I don't care much for&#xD;
quirlicues."&#xD;
"You don't like that"-said Mr. Freeman,-"you&#xD;
wouldn't have one in your room for a dollar."&#xD;
" I tell you I like it particularly," said the Captain with&#xD;
an approving and contemplative twirl of his moustaches.&#xD;
" If ever I buy any shells I shall begin with this one."&#xD;
"I wonder who knows the names of things now !" said&#xD;
Mr. Freeman with an air of injured innocence. "Why&#xD;
man that is a razor shell!"&#xD;
The Captain certainly looked posed for a minute, but&#xD;
then he laughed as if he had received an extraordinary com-&#xD;
pliment. As for Mr. Freeman,-this tturn, together with&#xD;
his previous good-nature, so won upon my father that at&#xD;
parting he gave him a most cordial invitation to come as&#xD;
often as he could. Which invitation the gentleman cer-&#xD;
tainly complied with.&#xD;

CHAPTER XV.&#xD;
He must be very wise that can forbear being troubled at things very trouble-&#xD;
some.-T.LLOTSON.&#xD;
"  THAT can that light be ?" I exclaimed askive passed&#xD;
Y   the hall-window on our way to bed. It'was late&#xD;
at night, but some happy combination of circumstances and&#xD;
wakefulness had allowed me to sit up with the rest; and&#xD;
we now stood all together looking out and wondering. A&#xD;
steady red light shone to the north of us, beyond interve-&#xD;
ning woods and hills, deepening and fading, now clouded&#xD;
and now clear, as smoke and flame chased and displaced&#xD;
each other. In town, so far off a fire would have fixed no&#xD;
eye that was not quick to appreciate the beautiful; but&#xD;
here there were no visions of warring streams of water-the&#xD;
fire burned on in solitude; and instead of bells and rattling&#xD;
engines, there was the soft whirr of a multitude of insects.&#xD;
The flickering light seemed a more wild and fearsome thing&#xD;
in that silence, and we looked with a not untinged admira-&#xD;
tion. Perhaps ,men never feel what a weaker and more&#xD;
timid nature feels so readily,-that undefined fear with&#xD;
which myst ry can invest even a beautiful object. My&#xD;
father had been called 'to Baltimore by the illness of his&#xD;
brother; and we left alone, felt all the influences of a sim-&#xD;
ple but unexplained phenomenon.&#xD;
" Wise people we are !" said Stephanie at length,--" of&#xD;
course it'sjust a house at Wiamee !"&#xD;
"Wiamee is more to the west, and the houses are too&#xD;
small to make such a light."&#xD;
"Not too small to burn up, are they ?" said Stephanie,-&#xD;
and it may be the whole village ; you can't tell west from&#xD;
est in the dark."&#xD;
"But it does not spread nor move on," said Kate,-" it&#xD;
burns steadily in one place-there went somebody's roof!"&#xD;

There was a sudden deadening of the light, then it burned&#xD;
furiously for a few minutes, and then seemed to die gradu-&#xD;
ally out.&#xD;
" Exit,"-said Stephanie turning front the window; "it&#xD;
was probably one of Mr. Collingwood's favourite farm-&#xD;
houses, so if we go to bed at once Kate, I don't doubt&#xD;
but we shall dream that we saved all the furniture except&#xD;
,, tumbler."&#xD;
"Here's Misther Barrington ma'am," said Caddie as&#xD;
she brought in the second plate of muffins next morning.&#xD;
"Mr. Barrington ? does he want anything ?"&#xD;
"He does ma'am."&#xD;
"I have no idea," said Stephanie helping herself to a&#xD;
muffin, "that I could ever have learned the style laconic, if&#xD;
I had been fifty times a Spartan."&#xD;
"Shew him in here, Caddie," said my stepmother, and&#xD;
our factotum presented himself.&#xD;
"How aresyoueEzra ?" she continued, "have you got&#xD;
quite well?"&#xD;
"'m pretty smart, ma'am," said Mr. Barrington with a&#xD;
strong emphasis on the pronoun.&#xD;
"And Mrs. Barrington, and the children?"&#xD;
"Couldn't be no better," said Ezra,-" if all folks was&#xD;
as quiet and well-behoven as they be, the world would go&#xD;
on a sight straighter."&#xD;
"Intimate connection between mankind's obliquity and&#xD;
that of the earth !" said Stephanie.-" What's going crooked&#xD;
Mr. Barrington ?"&#xD;
But that gentleman, after the involuntary compliment to&#xD;
his family, had relapsed into silence; and stood with raised&#xD;
brows eyeing the carpet as if it held the key to some prob-&#xD;
lem.&#xD;
The look and attitude were a little startling.&#xD;
" Is anything the matter ?" said Mrs Howard.&#xD;
"No ma'am,"-said Ezra hesitating, "nothing partic'lar&#xD;
-only the mill's destructionized."&#xD;
" Burned down !" cried we all, taking a short cut to the&#xD;
truth.&#xD;
"Jus' so," said Mr. Barrington looking up in some sur-&#xD;
prise ; "who yelled ye ?"&#xD;

"Nobody-the light,"-said Kate drawing her breath,--&#xD;
"Dear mamma don't look pale about it !-how did it hap-&#xD;
pen, Ezra ?"&#xD;
"'Well, I reckon there was sunthin conbustible sot next&#xD;
to it," said Mr. Barrington, as if he had worked his way to&#xD;
that conclusion.  There warn't no one into it, so it must&#xD;
ha' been done outside."&#xD;
"Not on purpose ?" said Mts. Howard.&#xD;
If it warn't a purpose nothi ever was,-the mill didn't&#xD;
burn up of its own head, Im clear."&#xD;
"That can't be-it's some carelessness,-nobody would&#xD;
-set it on fire."&#xD;
" Well ma'am," said Ezra slowly, ,they tell me hearsay&#xD;
ain't evidence in a court of judgment, and I s'pose guessing&#xD;
ain't ho more,-otherways I'd get that Simpson togq up,&#xD;
first thing."~&#xD;
"He could not have had any hand in it," said Mrs.&#xD;
Howard.&#xD;
"Couldn't hardly been no one else, ma'am. He's always&#xD;
kep' a talking how our mill stopped his t water privilege'-&#xD;
massy knows 'tain't much '.privilege' I'd give him, if&#xD;
'twarn't in the water ! Why the Squire ain't an unfriend&#xD;
in the county but him.".&#xD;
"IY did not know he was one."~&#xD;
"Like enough," said Ezra, "but most things can't be&#xD;
known till afterwards. There's my woman said this morn-&#xD;
ing she saw a dreadful big light off to Wiamee, and I yelled&#xD;
her she was dreaming of the kitchen fire ; so she said&#xD;
wouldn't it be wonderful if it was the mill, and I said&#xD;
wouldn't it be wonderful if she had more sense. Howsever&#xD;
I got tired and went to see, finally, and there it was all ashes&#xD;
and burnt sticks. It took me right on a none-plush," he&#xD;
added feelingly.&#xD;
We sat silent for a while, not knowing what to say or&#xD;
ask.&#xD;
"But Mr. Simpson wouldn't have done such a wicked&#xD;
thing-and for no'reason," remarked Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
"1Folks don't stand about reasons for wickedness; com-&#xD;
monly," said Mr. Barrington with a slight touch of disdain,&#xD;
"or don't wait till they find good ones, anyhow. Mr.&#xD;
Simpson's pretty nigh as fond of hard dollars as most men,&#xD;

But the mil's burnt and no mistake, and I s'pose sunthin&#xD;
ought to be done about it."&#xD;
"1Nothing can be done till Mr. Howard. comes home&#xD;
Ezra, unless you can find out who has done us this mis-&#xD;
chief."&#xD;
" Well, I guess likely," said Mr. Barrington, "but as to&#xD;
finding out-the likest thing is when a man's got only one&#xD;
enemy, that he's done it. Howsever, 111 look over the&#xD;
Squirt's friends-if it don't do no good it can't do no harm,&#xD;
and there's no telling where a blessing may light, as my&#xD;
wife says."&#xD;
And Mr. Barrington departed, with a face that said the&#xD;
worst part of the business was over.,&#xD;
The muffins came in unheeded.-&#xD;
"Surely mamma," Kate began, "papa has not interfered&#xD;
with anybody's rights ?"&#xD;
"I know nothing about it my dear-some one has in-&#xD;
terfered with his, most certainly: but for the rest we must&#xD;
be in the dark till he comes home," she added sighing.&#xD;
"It's very good he doesn't know of it !" I said.&#xD;
"Won't you write to him mamma ?" said Kate.&#xD;
" No, it's not best,-his head and hands are full enggh&#xD;
now; and he ought not to leave his brother for any mill&#xD;
that ever was built."&#xD;
This was all true, and we acted upon it. But how does&#xD;
a trouble swell when it is locked up ! how were we tried by&#xD;
our own quiet endurance !&#xD;
"It seems strange that such a thing should affect us so&#xD;
nearly," said Kate.-" Just think mamma, two years ago&#xD;
we should hardly have noticed it, and' now that mill seemed&#xD;
to be our best hope of getting on."&#xD;
"I should be sorry indeed if that seeming were reality,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Howard, "and it depends upon circumstances,&#xD;
Katie, whether 'to get on' be a blessing or a curse-some.&#xD;
times the word is 'Back for thy life!'"&#xD;
"1But Mrs. Howard !" said Stephanie-" how you do talk!&#xD;
Look here," she added planting herself before her-" now&#xD;
weren't you most troubled because of these girls ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said my stepmother with a voice not yet un-&#xD;
troubled, " but my dear child that does not prove me wise&#xD;
&#xD;
/j&#xD;
&#xD;
or clear-sighted,-perhaps it is for them that I ought to be&#xD;
glad. Better lose the world than rest in it."&#xD;
We were yet musing over the breakfast-table, when Cad-&#xD;
die ushered in another visiter-Mr. Collingwood.-&#xD;
" No ma'am, I can't sit down," he said, "I scarce ough t&#xD;
to have come in so early ; but dear Mrs. Howard, will you&#xD;
tell me in all frankness-,is there anything we can do for&#xD;
you ?-my father would have come himself, but he was too&#xD;
unwell."&#xD;
"Thank him very much, and you too Mr. Rodney, but&#xD;
I think there.is nothing : all we can do is to keep ourselves&#xD;
quiet."&#xD;
"Are you sure? I will see anybody and do anything&#xD;
that you can think of use."&#xD;
"Quite sure," said Mrs. Howard, answering his earnest&#xD;
look with a smile that was withal a little tremulous--&#xD;
"unless you will sit down andread us a lesson of patience."&#xD;
"It would be to myself ma'am," he said,-" I am but an&#xD;
unpractised learner.&#xD;
"You see Mr. Collingwood," said Stephanie-who had a&#xD;
great aversion to that silence when people feel too much to&#xD;
speak-"there's nothing to be done but to build up the&#xD;
mill and catch the burner; and, no disparagement to your&#xD;
strength and. wisdom, you can't do either."&#xD;
" Miss Stephanie," he said with a smile, "are you laugh-&#xD;
ing yet ?"&#xD;
" Only because I'd rather not cry,-one must do some-&#xD;
thing, and Kate always says it's folly to be worried."&#xD;
"I fear she has not persuaded herself of that," said Mr.&#xD;
Rodney approaching her. -. "Miss Kate, are you thinking of&#xD;
those blue mountains  "&#xD;
She looked up to answer him, but .the recollection was&#xD;
just one she could not bear,-heir eyes fell again.&#xD;
"You remember what we were talking of?" he said very&#xD;
gently-" that they are but like the rest of the world when&#xD;
reached ? If we feel sure that our happiness cannot be&#xD;
perfect in this life, wf should the less grieve over the things&#xD;
that come to mar it. ' In the shadow of thy wings will I&#xD;
riake    refuge, until these calamities be overpast !"'&#xD;
"Bu she is only worried for papa," I said, "and because&#xD;
mamma looked so grave."&#xD;

"And you are troubled for her, Gracie ?-l wish I could&#xD;
give you more than sympathy."&#xD;
"That is the best thing we could have just now," said&#xD;
my stepmother, "and if your time or exertions can do us&#xD;
any good, Mr. Rodney, we will call for them."&#xD;
There were indeed but few people to give us sympathy,&#xD;
but they gave it in double measure. Miss Easy came to&#xD;
us the moment she heard of our disaster, and with a face&#xD;
of such quiet sorrow and concern, that our own brightened&#xD;
immediately.&#xD;
"Dear Mrs. Howard," she said, "could any one think&#xD;
there were such wicked people in the world ?-after all the&#xD;
difficulty you have had with that mill! yes ma'am, it really&#xD;
surprises me."&#xD;
"You'must not be troubled for us, my der. friend," said&#xD;
my stepmother.&#xD;
"Troubled !" said Miss Easy, her eyes filling to their&#xD;
utmost capacity, "yes ma'am I will be troubled-yes.&#xD;
What's the use of friends if they're not to be troubled for&#xD;
each other? Yes ma'am, I. hope I am a friend. But how&#xD;
do you all do ?-and poor Mr. Howard-what -will he&#xD;
I hardly know-I almost dread his coming home."&#xD;
" He will bear it well-he has a true christian spirit,"&#xD;
said Miss Easy thoughtfully ; "but trials have their effect&#xD;
nevertheless.  Though the promise stands' sure, 'there&#xD;
shall no evil, befall them that trust in me:  And yet,"&#xD;
she added sadly as she bent down and kissed my forehead,&#xD;
"I cannot bear to see the weight over this child's eyes,--&#xD;
yes ma'am, that grieves me more than anything."&#xD;
How quick other eyes in the room answered to her&#xD;
words!&#xD;
"Papa will set it all right when he comes, dear Miss&#xD;
Easy," I said; "and there will be no weight over my eyes&#xD;
then."&#xD;
"1Nobody could give a better definition. of supporting&#xD;
faith," said Miss Easy with another kiss,-"1eve so should&#xD;
we trust our heavenly Father-'it will be all sft right and&#xD;
there will be no weight over our eyes then.'-Der Mts.&#xD;
Howard, that should make the weight sit lighter now."&#xD;

"But can't you all come and stay with me till Mr. Iow-&#xD;
ard gets back ? Yes ma'am, now do," said Miss Easy..-." it&#xD;
would make me so happy."&#xD;
"We must not do'it, even for that, dear Miss Easy,"&#xD;
said my stepmother,-" he may come at any time, and&#xD;
would. want to find us here."&#xD;
"True," said Miss Caffery, "yes ma'am, you are always&#xD;
right, and always think of' everything-yes. But I must&#xD;
see you often somewhere-you can at least come for a few&#xD;
hours,-yes, you must promise me that."&#xD;
And we did.&#xD;
My father came not for three weeks, and after each letter&#xD;
we had a feeling of mingled' pain and pleasure,-that he&#xD;
must so soon .know-that as yet he knew nothing. But&#xD;
the appointed day. came, and with it Mr. Howard.&#xD;
The moment we saw him on the walk, we all felt that he&#xD;
had already heard the news,-not that there was exactly a&#xD;
cloud on his face, but there seemed to be a slight drooping&#xD;
of the head, a relaxing of the muscles, a want of the usual&#xD;
alert resolution of his gait.; the very swing: of his umbrella&#xD;
spoke of- disturbance ; and when he entered the house, his&#xD;
greeting if not less affectionate was graver than usual.&#xD;
Since we had lived at Glen Luna one difficulty had come on&#xD;
the heels of another, and this new one was much the worse&#xD;
for the long string which had gone before it.. Thoughts&#xD;
took a far range, but our first words were simply,&#xD;
"How is uncle Ned, papa ?"&#xD;
"Somewhat better-not satisfactorily so to my mind,"&#xD;
said Mr. Howard throwing himself into a chair. "Dear&#xD;
me-this hot weather is -trying !"&#xD;
The weariness of that long breath !&#xD;
" One must not mind even trying things too much," said&#xD;
my stepmother forcing herself to speak-with what effort&#xD;
the voice told.&#xD;
My father looked at her, and then looked out of the win.&#xD;
dow.&#xD;
"It won't do, 1(ary," he said,-" you never can imbue&#xD;
my spirit with the quiet patience of yours. I declare! I&#xD;
thought last night of David's words-' 0 that I had wings&#xD;
Like ar dove,--then would I flee away and be at rest !"&#xD;
" Not from us, papa ?" said Kate softly.&#xD;

is so bad as that."&#xD;
"It is hard not to be a little troubled Grae-the loss is&#xD;
a very serious one of its kind. I would fain bear it sub-&#xD;
missively." And then looking round at us he said, But&#xD;
you must wear bright faces if you expectome to."&#xD;
" Owe will papa," said Kate. tDo you think Mr. Simp-&#xD;
son could have done this ? have you interfered with him in&#xD;
any way ?"&#xD;
" No more than I have with you, my dear; but I sup-&#xD;
pose he thought my mill would deprive his, not of water,&#xD;
but employment.Yes-I presume he did it, or got it&#xD;
" But how could he-what right had he to interfere with&#xD;
Syour mill?  Surely he couldn't take the law into his own&#xD;
hands for any reason."&#xD;
"He will find he has it on his hands," said Mr. Howard;&#xD;
"  but my own rights are growing so very misty and unde-&#xD;
fined, that I know but little about those of other people."&#xD;
Alas we had the law on our hands too ! Suits and cross-&#xD;
suits, and pleas and bills and demurrers,-money to be&#xD;
paid for all. Dollars here for witnesses, and there for a&#xD;
journey to some distant court; and again for a speech&#xD;
which Mr. Howard said wasn't worth a pin. The war of&#xD;
poor rights against rich injustice.&#xD;
In 'the midst of all this pense and annoyance, some&#xD;
pleasant things sprang up. a  e were sgrealy touched by&#xD;
an offer from Stephanie of a=rt o  her own small fortune&#xD;
towards the rebuilding of the  .    yill.&#xD;
" My dear child !" said my father, "do you think I would&#xD;
do such a thing?  I cannot tell you how it grieves me,&#xD;
that I should be quite unable to add to what, you ant to&#xD;

with me--not to speak of the care and kindness which&#xD;
cannot be paid for," she added tearfully.&#xD;
"It is all paid for-with interest," said my father kissing&#xD;
her, while we gathered round with glistening eyes,-"a and&#xD;
you will want what you have my dear, depend upon it.&#xD;
Come you must think a little of somebody else."&#xD;
"If somebody else can't get along without my help,"&#xD;
said she colouring slightly,'"he will never get along at all,&#xD;
-so my conscience is clear there. But you, dear Mr.&#xD;
Howard, have lost and suffered so much"-&#xD;
"That I ought to know how to take care of other people.&#xD;
You must let me do it for you as long as I can my dear;&#xD;
it is a pleasure that I shall owe Mr. Freeman some ill-will&#xD;
for depriving me of. ' No, 'I will not hear another word, and&#xD;
here comes somebody in good time to receive them all.&#xD;
Mr. Freeman I am very glad to see you, sir, though&#xD;
Stephanie has just been persuading me that I ought to dis-&#xD;
"Dislike me sir ?"&#xD;
"You sir."&#xD;
And yet you are glad to see me,"-said the gentleman.&#xD;
" Then Miss Stephanie's eloquence must have failed-if she&#xD;
could employ it in so bad a cause."&#xD;
"She did employ it," said Mr. Howard gravely; "but&#xD;
as she taught by precept and not example, all I learned was&#xD;
to love her more than ever."&#xD;
"fAnd if that lesson is not perfect sir, you know where&#xD;
to find the example," was the smiling reply as Mr. Free-&#xD;
man shook hands with us all round.&#xD;
He had certainly improved since our first acquaintance-&#xD;
or we had learned, to appreciate him. Without anything&#xD;
very bright or extraordinary, he had a pleasant mixture of&#xD;
good nature and good sense with a slight spice of pecu-&#xD;
liarity,-not enough toelaugh at but with. Altogether you&#xD;
felt sure Mr. Freeman would get on in the world, though&#xD;
you never thought of his making.a stir therein. Stephanie&#xD;
too had hnproved,.z~perhaps by the prospect of real life&#xD;
before he; or as she said "of the arctic ocean"; and the&#xD;
feeling that Mr. Freeman's house was tolerably glazed,&#xD;
may have made her more tender of other people's windows.&#xD;
So it was, that while her chance of happiness increased, our&#xD;

uniwillingness to part company increased also; and at&#xD;
length Mr. Freeman declared that he never came to the&#xD;
house without feeling as if he were going "birdth-nethtimg."&#xD;
The bird was fledged at length. Stephanie and Mr.&#xD;
Freeman were married one fair day when the autumn was&#xD;
showering gold leaves; and beneath a blue October sky&#xD;
they went forth into the world to seek their fortune.&#xD;

"  TE shall have a lonely winter of it," said Miss Easy,&#xD;
as she sat at our tea-table some two weeks after Ste-&#xD;
phanie's departure,-" yes ma'am, we shall indeed."&#xD;
"We shall," said Mrs. Howard, "it will take us some&#xD;
time to get used to the change; but you,, Miss Easy ?"-&#xD;
" Didn't you know that Mr. Rodney is going away ?"&#xD;
"Mr. Rodney !" cried I.&#xD;
"Not for the winter ?" said mamma and Kate.&#xD;
"Yes ma'am, for the winter. Farmer Collingwood's&#xD;
health seems even less good than usual, and nothing will&#xD;
content Mr. Rodney but to have his father try a warmer&#xD;
climate. So they are both going,"-and Miss Easy's voice&#xD;
went with them.&#xD;
"I am very sorry indeed," said Mrs..Howard.&#xD;
"Yes ma'am, every one must be that,-we are all sorry,&#xD;
yes; but I have always seen so much of him-and the Ber-&#xD;
mudas are a long way off."&#xD;
"Bermuda-do they go there ?"&#xD;
"Yes; and what troubles me most, is, that I fear they can&#xD;
ill afford the expense. TheFarmer I know thinks so, yes&#xD;
ma'am; but Mr. Rodnewon'thear or allow a word of it.&#xD;
So they go," she reate  ith a sigh, "the first of Decem-&#xD;

" My dear sir," she said, "pray' don't think of such a&#xD;
thing !-dear me, what have I said ! I am very sorry in-&#xD;
deed, yes sir. But I never can get him to speak on the&#xD;
subject-it's only my own notions, yes; pray don't think&#xD;
of it again. I should have been wiser, but I thought you&#xD;
were dreaming, as we say. Yes sir, I did indeed."&#xD;
"You thought about right ma'am," said my father; "but&#xD;
like most dreamers I was weaving a web of mixed truth&#xD;
and falsehood, and your words were the nearest realities&#xD;
that came to hand. But I must think of this matter,-I&#xD;
must find out how it is ; and if he wants anything, I will&#xD;
dispose of the other fingers somehow-he shall have it."&#xD;
"My dear Mr. Howard! that is like you," said Miss&#xD;
Easy,-" but now sir you mustn't do such a thing. If you&#xD;
would be willing to act for me-if you should find what I&#xD;
have feared, true; I have spare funds, yes sir,-at least I&#xD;
think I could get them-and Mr. Rodney would never take&#xD;
anything from me, but perhaps I might do it through you,&#xD;
yes sir."&#xD;
"No ma'am," said my father; "I will neither take credit&#xD;
that does not belong to me, nor let you deprive yourself&#xD;
of a single comfort if I can help it,-the business must be&#xD;
managed some other way."&#xD;
"It would be to give myself comfort," said Miss Easy&#xD;
sighing, "if I could relieve that poor boy from what I fear&#xD;
he has taken upon himself, and what I know is too much&#xD;
for him."&#xD;
" And what is that ?" said my stepmother.&#xD;
"Earning money ma'am, in all times and ways,-yes&#xD;
ma'am, I am sure he is not always studying,-I am sure he&#xD;
is trying to provide for this journey. Why I can hardly&#xD;
get sight of him."&#xD;
"But what could he do-out here ?" said my father.&#xD;
"0 I don't know sir-copying, and translating and&#xD;
draughting,-he is good at everything. Why sir," said&#xD;
Miss Easy with sparkling eyes, "he taught school in the&#xD;
first place till he could prepare himself for college; and&#xD;
then he paid his own way when there,-and his brother's&#xD;
too, fordhat matter-so long as he would stay. And was&#xD;
always at the head of everything too-though he spent&#xD;
half of the study hours in hearing recitations. I suppose&#xD;
&#xD;
he's ahead of every one now, for he has studied harder than&#xD;
ever since he came -home,-too much for his health, I&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"I hope he will get as much good as his father, from the&#xD;
journey," said Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
" He don't want to go ma'am, not at all, for himself,-yes&#xD;
ma'am, I think he looks very sober about it."&#xD;
"Hush !-" said my father,-and Caddie opening the door&#xD;
announced Mr. Collingwood. Sober he did look, or it might&#xD;
be fatigued, but with no tinge of gloominess in either eye or&#xD;
voice,-there never was a nature more absolutely without&#xD;
it. Had the business of his life been to seek his own indi-&#xD;
vidual pleasure, in the pleasantest way, Mr. Collingwood&#xD;
could not have looked more free from doubt and discon-&#xD;
tent.&#xD;
I have been to see you Miss Easy," he said after the&#xD;
first salutations;-" and Miss Avarintha told me you were&#xD;
here,-so I thought my escort might not come amiss. I&#xD;
haven't given you a chance to get tired of me lately."&#xD;
" Nor us either, I am sure," said my stepmother,-" do&#xD;
you think it necessary to excuse yourself for coming here&#xD;
once a month?"&#xD;
"No ma'am," he said smiling,-.-"it is not quite so long&#xD;
since my last visit."&#xD;
"But you ought to com  very often Mr. Rodney," I said&#xD;
-" when we like to see you so much."&#xD;
"And when it is so soon to be ended," said Mrs. How-&#xD;
ard.&#xD;
A grave bow, and a look where there was too much&#xD;
feeling for a smile, answered both remarks; and after a&#xD;
moment he said,&#xD;
" Yes, very soon."&#xD;
" How is your father to-night, Mr. Rodney ?" said Miss&#xD;
Easy.&#xD;
"Not well ma'am: I hope he will gain strength when we&#xD;
are once off but I think the idea of the journey rather&#xD;
fatigues him."&#xD;
"But my dear sir," said my father, "why don't you go&#xD;
at once ?-you ought have finished your journey by the first&#xD;
of December, instead of beginning it. .Surely two gentle-&#xD;
men need not be so long getting ready."&#xD;

The deep flush which crossed Mr. Rodney's face while&#xD;
my father spoke, seemed to confirm Miss Easy's words: it&#xD;
was but a moment however, and then in his usual quiet way&#xD;
he said,&#xD;
"You are quite right Mr. Howard,-I am truly sorry&#xD;
our decision was not made sooner."&#xD;
"But it wants three weeks to December-why not set&#xD;
off at once ?"&#xD;
Again the flush, the slight hesitation; and then with a&#xD;
smile came the answer.&#xD;
"Nay sir, I have arranged to go on the first of Decem-&#xD;
ber, and we must even wait till then. Miss Avarintha&#xD;
would tell you that it is owing to my 'native obstinacy'."&#xD;
. " How long shall you stay ?" said Mr. Howard abruptly&#xD;
changing his ground.&#xD;
'I cannot tell sir. If, as Dr. Revere thinks, the climate&#xD;
should particularly suit my father's health, we may be&#xD;
there long,-perhaps permanently."&#xD;
"You don't mean, always, Mr. Rodney ?"&#xD;
"Always is a long word Gracie," he said, smiling half in&#xD;
spite of himself at my earnestness,-" I am sure I do not&#xD;
wish to speak it in such a connexion."&#xD;
"You haven't seen Bermuda yet," said my father.&#xD;
" No sir."-&#xD;
"Characteristically disposed of!" said Mr. Howard laugh-&#xD;
ing,-" you won't even condescend to notice my insinua-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
" What kind of a place is Bermuda, papa ?" said Kate.&#xD;
"Really my dear I know very little about it, though I,,&#xD;
have heard a great deal. But as people always praise what,&#xD;
they do like, and slander what they don't, my knowledge&#xD;
of Bermuda is simply geographical."&#xD;
" And mine," said Mr. Rodney; "but if Ilive to come&#xD;
back Miss Kate, you shall have at least such a one-sided&#xD;
account as Mr. Howard refers to."&#xD;
"Who takes care of Daisy Lea while you are gone ?"&#xD;
asked my stepmother.&#xD;
" Mrs. Crown and her nephew, for the present na'am."&#xD;

ever from Purrer-purrer, Miss Gracie."&#xD;
"Ah he will come here sometimes," I said, "and we&#xD;
shall go to see him. How he will miss you Mr. Rodney !"&#xD;
" Miss me ?-yes, a little,--I hope so, I should like to be&#xD;
missed. And yet it is a selfish hope too," he said, as he&#xD;
rose in obedience to Miss Easy's summons. "Strange,&#xD;
that one should wish to give pain to one's friends !"&#xD;
"But if you take away the power of pain Mr. rolling-&#xD;
wood," said Kate, "the power of pleasure goes with it."&#xD;
" And the power of usefulness too, in a measure," said.&#xD;
my father,-" they are all interwoven."&#xD;
"Then I will be as selfish as possible," he answered smi-&#xD;
ling ; "'good night."&#xD;
My father mused for a while after they were gone, and&#xD;
then jumping up he said,&#xD;
"1I shall just go out and waylay that boy, for I sha'n't&#xD;
rest till I know the truth."&#xD;
But at the end of an hour he came back with an unenlight-&#xD;
ened face.&#xD;
" And what is the truth ?" said Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
" The truth is that Mr. Rodney is rather the best and&#xD;
most unmanageable person in the world. I dashed into the&#xD;
subject at once, according to custom, and without more than&#xD;
half an apology ; but he either made up the other half, or&#xD;
didn't want it."&#xD;
"And did you get any satisfaction ?"&#xD;
" Not a bit-except as I tell you as to his being a little&#xD;
better than other people. He didn't attempt to deny or&#xD;
remove my suspicions and inferences, but I could get no&#xD;
further-he was as stiff as, buckram. Only he gave me&#xD;
much warmer thanks than I deserved, and left me, I do&#xD;
believe, with wet eyes."&#xD;
How swiftly those three weeks sped away !-and we saw&#xD;
but little of the friends that were to follow them. Even&#xD;
when we all walked over to the Lea to visit once more its&#xD;
kind master, he was so unwell that we were not admitted.&#xD;
But he grew better after that; and on the last day of No-&#xD;
vember Mr. and Mrs. Howard went again to see him.&#xD;
It was Sunday afternoon;. and Kate and I sat alone in&#xD;
our little tea-room, singing hymns,--going over with a&#xD;

strange pleasure the bright hopes and anticipations which&#xD;
we had no share in. One and another was finished, and at&#xD;
last. that one-" I am bound for the kingdom," when we&#xD;
became aware of Mr. Rodney's presence.&#xD;
We had heard neither door nor step; but as our voices&#xD;
ceased he came forward, shook hands with us silently, and&#xD;
then seating himself by us, he said,&#xD;
"'Bound for the kingdom'-dear friends are you indeed&#xD;
that ."&#xD;
We did not answer-we could not. The hymn had&#xD;
wrought upon us both a good deal, yet in an indefinite, un-&#xD;
fruitful sort of way ; but now with these applying words&#xD;
came its full force,-duty, responsibility, privilege-all&#xD;
neglected, seemed now all set before us,-all weighing us&#xD;
down. What had we been singing-" bound for the king-&#xD;
dom !"-and the intention had never entered our hearts!&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood looked at us earnestly ; and perhaps he&#xD;
read in the quivering lips and half-interrupted breath, the&#xD;
negative to his question; for he added very gravely, and&#xD;
yet with even more than his accustomed kindness and gen-&#xD;
tleness,&#xD;
"If not for it, then from it !&#xD;
True! true !-and with bowed heads and weeping eyes&#xD;
we gave silent assent to his words.&#xD;
"There is no better description of a Christian's life," he&#xD;
said presently,---" there can be no more perfect reply to&#xD;
the trials of it, 'Bound for the kingdom,'-as a ship is&#xD;
bound that even in adverse winds so sets her sails that she&#xD;
is driven forward, or so casts anchor that she is not driven&#xD;
back; and for that kingdom which is so beyond comparison&#xD;
with all others, that there is no need of specification,-' the&#xD;
kingdom' !-that is enough ! Enough for him too,-the&#xD;
light that sheds one straight, undeviating line of brightness&#xD;
over the restless sea-uneelipsed by the sun, unhid by the&#xD;
cloud; that lures him to breast the waves, though trem-&#xD;
bling, shuddering with their violence, yet still on! He is&#xD;
homeward bound, and for the kingdom !"&#xD;
Again he paused; and again did our hearts answer to&#xD;
every word that came so warm, so energized from his: yet&#xD;
we could not speak. As when the wind comes out dead&#xD;
ahead, and checked, startled, the ship seems uncertain how&#xD;

to trim her shivering sails, so did we hesitate,--not from&#xD;
doubt of the right, but from a mixture of bewilderment,&#xD;
surprise and fear. Had we then been bound on a reef?--&#xD;
from "the kingdom ?"&#xD;
"Yes !" said Mr. Collingwood at length, as if he read&#xD;
our thoughts; "for it or from it !-you cannot chooserbut&#xD;
be one. Dear Miss Howard, dear Gracie, think of it!&#xD;
bound from the kingdom! from its blessings, its rest, its&#xD;
everlasting reward'!"&#xD;
We were weeping bitterly; and for sometime there&#xD;
was no word, spoken, except now and then one of counsel&#xD;
or entreaty from Mr. Collingwood. But at length Kate&#xD;
exerting all her self-command, looked up and thanked him&#xD;
in a few earnest words for what he had said,-while I, whose&#xD;
feelings were less under control, dared not trust my voice.&#xD;
"God grant we may all sail on together !" he said sigh-&#xD;
ing; "and to that shore where there can be no shipwreck."&#xD;
And then taking a hid of each, Mr. Rodney parted from&#xD;
us with the words of Samuel Rutherford,&#xD;
"I shall rejoice to hear of your welfare, and that your&#xD;
faces are up the mountain !"&#xD;

YES, that was a lonely winter. For our spirits had not&#xD;
now     fulat fl tide which sweeps away slight obstructions,&#xD;
sports with them, tosses them a one ide in a mask of its&#xD;
own foam ;--how, the current had need of a clear channel.&#xD;
We all -missed Stephanie's bright, unshadowed eye, Far-&#xD;
mer Collingwood's morning visits, and the frequent sight&#xD;
and hearing of Mr. Rodney.-so many of the visiters we&#xD;
had left talked neither sense nor sympathy. And then&#xD;
without any defined cloud the light of our fortunes and&#xD;
prospects seemed declining; though as in the day's twilight,&#xD;
we hardly realized the progress except when we looked&#xD;
back. Things were changed. We were changed ourselves&#xD;
-how much, from that first bright day when I came to&#xD;
Glen Luna ! Ah me !-it was a necessary, inevitable change&#xD;
-the young heart cannot keep its spring,-and yet it&#xD;
makes mine ache now to think of it. I had not lost the&#xD;
childish simplicity of hope and enjoyment, but upon it was&#xD;
grafted a scion of real life, to which all fresh shoots of the&#xD;
former must in time be sacrificed. And I was softly passing&#xD;
from the brook to the river, and knew it not !&#xD;
As the winter passed, we felt more and more the truth&#xD;
of Mr. Rodney's words,-were more and 'more resolved to&#xD;
follow them. We could have answered him now ;-yes,&#xD;
we were "bound for the kingdom"!&#xD;

through that quiet seclusion, we yet saw the dust of his&#xD;
chariot wheels. Surely if "there is no new thing under&#xD;
the sun," it might almost be said, that in one sense neither&#xD;
is there any old ! The very tree at the house door is not&#xD;
to-day what it was last year ; and this other, behind which&#xD;
the chimneys loomed up, unapproachable, now towers&#xD;
above them, and throws its leaves and shadows upon the&#xD;
roof beyond. The stone step which in all its rough new.&#xD;
ness said "I have just come"; how lovingly the turf&#xD;
closes upon its edge, how firmly the green tufts cling and&#xD;
grow, even encroachingly. The rains and .the' dews have&#xD;
bleached its grey, and loved feet have worn its hardness--&#xD;
it is "an old inhabitant."&#xD;
Shadows where there was sunshine-the wearing down of&#xD;
what seemed unchangeable,--yes, such is Time'swork: but&#xD;
here see his work too-the opening of       view that&#xD;
before was hid,-a path for the light ti ha   dark forest&#xD;
that seemed impenetrable.&#xD;
Foremost among the changes--not in itself but in its&#xD;
effect-was the death of Mr. Cary--the minister at Lake&#xD;
End. He was succeeded by a man of strong mind and&#xD;
body, with a will that spared neither, when they could be&#xD;
of use,--and we could go to church once more. Then we&#xD;
realized what we had been without. I never knew what&#xD;
sermons were worth, till I heard them after those years of&#xD;
privation.&#xD;
.   tConsequent upon this came another comfort. It was&#xD;
clearly our .duty to go to church, therefore it was a duty to&#xD;
have bonnets and cloaks to go in; and little as Kate and 1ws&#xD;
cared about dress, it was pleasant to feel free to go where&#xD;
we wished, like other people.&#xD;
Mr. Ellis was not the only new comer,--the McLoons&#xD;
had settled in the neighbourhood, and we had Mrs. Willet&#xD;
another old friends for prospective vis-a-vis at the Sulphur&#xD;
spring. Yet from all these we turned with what pleasure&#xD;
to the Bird's zNest !--Miss Easy was more beloved than&#xD;
ever, and these novelties faded away by contrast. She&#xD;
'always came to us as soon as she got a letter from Ber-&#xD;

her hand sighingly upon my forehead, as if she feared the&#xD;
weight. were there still.&#xD;
father could not resolve to leave the mill in ruins all&#xD;
the time the law suts were pending, but had set men to&#xD;
rebuilki as fast as possible; though Mr. Barrington avowed&#xD;
his belief that "Mr. Simpson could burn it down more&#xD;
speedier than we could put it up." As yet however, there&#xD;
had been no interference, but with the spring came nimble,&#xD;
mischance" in another form.&#xD;
I came down one Monday morning, when after several&#xD;
days of warm, breaking-up rain, earth and sky looked their&#xD;
loveliest, and found Mr. Howard putting on shoes that were&#xD;
unmistakeably for out of doors.&#xD;
"You won't have any time for pruning, papa," I said,&#xD;
"breakfast is just ready, and here come mamma and Kate."&#xD;
"Don't wait for me," said my father tying his shoe-&#xD;
strings with needless energy.&#xD;
"Why where are you going ?"&#xD;
"To Wiamee creek."-&#xD;
"To the mill!-so early !" said my stepmother,-" Oh&#xD;
wait till after breakfast."&#xD;
"There is no mill there, nor anything else that I know&#xD;
of, but water," he answered; and then seeing our anxious&#xD;
faces, he added in that tone of desperate calmness which&#xD;
betrays the excitement it is meant to cover,&#xD;
"These rains have brought a tremendous freshet, and&#xD;
the mill is carried away."&#xD;
How my heart sank !-and then in a moment I said,&#xD;
"Dear papa, do not look so grave,-maybe it is not so&#xD;
bad as you think-.",                         ..&#xD;
"It's as bad as it can be, I fancy," said my father sighing.&#xD;
"But do not look grave about it, still, papa," said Kate;&#xD;
"perhaps it can be mended, if it is bad; and at all events&#xD;
let us take things quietly."&#xD;
"See that you set me a good example then," he said,&#xD;
looking first at mamma and then at us.&#xD;
We followed him to the door, and called out,&#xD;
"Nowdon't stay long-come back and get some break-&#xD;
fast, and ten you can, go again;' and he gave us one smile&#xD;
that spgk% cf more tropible than even the cloud had done.&#xD;
Silently we sat down and waited ; and the hearts to which ~&#xD;

&#xD;
the birds sang songs grew heavy and inattentive, and the&#xD;
brightening light of the sun seemed more and more uncon-&#xD;
genial, until at last Mr. Howard returned. The damage&#xD;
was not quite so great as t might have been-at jst it&#xD;
could be repaired with dollars,-but where were the y be&#xD;
had? There were some yet, my father said-he worljd&#xD;
ways and means; and once in order, the mill would so'on&#xD;
pay for itself. Would it ever do that? would it everbe iri&#xD;
order ?-Both questions might be read in my stepmother's&#xD;
face, but Mr. Howard heeded them not, and having talked&#xD;
himself into at least temperate latitudes, he went off again ;&#xD;
and we staid at home and talked our spirits down to&#xD;
zero.-&#xD;
And then of all days in the year, Mrs. McLoon came to&#xD;
see us; and of all subjects of conversation, she hose the&#xD;
mill. And in the pure thoughtlessness of wealth told us&#xD;
how she had been riding past Wiamee, and had seen the&#xD;
carried-off timbers,-and how she was amused ; and how&#xD;
thye water had grouped them here and there,--and laughed&#xD;
all the while at her own description, till we were in doubt&#xD;
whether to cry or be angry. But, as says some French&#xD;
paper,&#xD;
Avec le 'Go HEAD,' qui personnifie en lui 'audace dans&#xD;
l'entreprise, et le 'No MIND,' qui represent le courage dans&#xD;
l'adversito, I' Amsricain di Nord accomplit des prodiges."-&#xD;
My father had both principles in action. No loss, no&#xD;
discou  ement could affect his practice: the head might be&#xD;
weary.   arrangements, the mind sick of endeavours, yet&#xD;
the   nd rarely stayed- its workings. Arrangements and&#xD;
endeavours were made and forwarded as if "time was" had&#xD;
come back to us; and if sometimesthe first brush of a dis-&#xD;
aster would sweep before it even the will to do,-the calm&#xD;
followed; and patience and faith-nerved energy came with&#xD;
the thought,&#xD;
"Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we&#xD;
not receive evil?" .&#xD;
Again men were set to work at the mill, and then,;1yT1i&#xD;
father got his witnesses together, and went to att nd one&#xD;
of the Simpson trials. To no purpose,-the trial was put&#xD;
oEy&#xD;

"Trying enough-and expensive enough too, that's the&#xD;
worst ofit."&#xD;
"But this won't hinder your building up the mill ?"&#xD;
"Hinder it completely. If the whole affair was to be&#xD;
settled in a few weeks, I thought I might venture to go on&#xD;
and rebuild; but I can't count upon Simpson's forbearance&#xD;
for six months. No, I must get the mill-dam in good&#xD;
order, and then wait patiently for September."&#xD;
Mrs. Howard sighed.&#xD;
"No need to' sigh about it my 'dear," said my father&#xD;
cheerfully ; "it will all. come-right-it is all right now.&#xD;
Being assured of that we may well submit to what God&#xD;
sends."&#xD;
"But papa," said I, "that does not prevent our feeling&#xD;
troubled-do you think it can ?"&#xD;
"Submission," said my father, "is a very different thing&#xD;
from insensibility,-it never was intended Gracie, that trials&#xD;
should be unfelt, for then their end would be unattained.&#xD;
'No trial for the present seemeth joyous, but grievous';&#xD;
and pain, sickness and poverty are in themselves evils.&#xD;
Yet if we are 'walking the way of God's commandments,'&#xD;
we need fear nothing that shall meet us-not even the&#xD;
passing pain; for with it God may give such views of 'the&#xD;
rest that remaineth,' that all the intervening labour and&#xD;
weariness shall seem but as a sweet preparation." -&#xD;
"One must have strong faith for that," said Mrs. How-&#xD;
ard with a half sigh.&#xD;
"Yes, and strong love. Do you remember the count&#xD;
given of some lady, who when she was about to submit to&#xD;
a dreadful operation, gave to one of the physicians the last&#xD;
letter which had come from her husband, asking him to&#xD;
hold it before her. And with her eyes fixed upon the open&#xD;
page and love-traced characters, she sat unmurmuring, un-,&#xD;
fainting throughout the whole.;&#xD;
."So let a, man but keep eye and heart fixed upon the&#xD;
words of Christ, 'As my-Father hath loved me, so have I&#xD;
loved you,' and 'Lo I am with you away, even unto the&#xD;
end of the world'; and they will gild even the deepest sor.&#xD;
rows,--how much.more such trifles as beset us."    -&#xD;
" Do you think they are quite trifles, papa ?" said Kate.&#xD;
" Yes dear, they are trifles-such trifles as 'make up the&#xD;

a day, I grant you; but pour on them a light from the&#xD;
eternal world-&#xD;
"'Fear not little flock, for it is your Father's good pleas-&#xD;
ure to give you the kingdom'-are they not trifles now?"&#xD;
And with one. look of joy and tears Kateand I had put&#xD;
our arms round each other ; for we too could see the dis-&#xD;
tant light which shone upon my father's sea of troubles.&#xD;
The time of the next trial approached. Hitherto we&#xD;
had known nothing of witnesses except that they cost a&#xD;
good deal, and were troublesome and hard to get,-so much&#xD;
Mr. Howard had imparted to us in different fits of discon-&#xD;
fort. Our fits were to come now. The night before my&#xD;
father went to meet judge and jurors at Amherst two men&#xD;
were ushered into the parlour, whom we at once placed in&#xD;
the said witness class,---they were not gentlemen, they&#xD;
were not beggars; and their conversation with my father&#xD;
savoured strongly of hydraulics and water privilege. The&#xD;
older and larger of the two, had more of himself than he&#xD;
seemingly knew' what to do with; and certainly more than&#xD;
suited our slight chairs and country doorways. One organ&#xD;
of vision eyed you curiously with humour, sense, conscious-&#xD;
ness and determined unconsciousness of his position; while&#xD;
the other scanned the corner or looked out of the window,&#xD;
--there was no " right and tight" about Mr. Barnabeds.&#xD;
His free and easy manner, however, was not tinctured with&#xD;
impropriety nor disrespect-neither with their opposites:&#xD;
on the whole he was rather amusing.&#xD;
His companion Mr., Pegraph, was a little pug-dog of a&#xD;
man, as knowing and opinionative as if he had swallowed&#xD;
and digested all the books that ever were written. So.&#xD;
desperately smart too, and so satisfied with his own sinart-&#xD;
ness, that one laughed with a slightly provoked feeling.&#xD;
"My dear father !" said Kate when they had at last gone&#xD;
to bed, "how could you let those men come here?"&#xD;
"Because they are to give testimony for me to-morrow.&#xD;
" Of course-that might take them to Amherst, but wh&#xD;
bring them here ?"&#xD;
"1 should have had to pay for their night's lodging sone-&#xD;
where ; and I diddt suppose they would contamile our&#xD;
roof by sleeping under it once."&#xD;

160             DOLLARS AND CENTS.&#xD;
"Contaminate! no papa, I should hope not; 'but they're&#xD;
not fit to be in 1$dies' society, nor gentlemen's either."&#xD;
"They are not going to be-they are here for one night&#xD;
to suit my convenience. I have no money to spare, unfor-&#xD;
tunately.&#xD;
"Certainly, that may make it-all right and necessary,"&#xD;
said Kate; "'but then papa you must allow that it is bad&#xD;
in other respects. Just imagine their being seen here !"&#xD;
"Everybody is welcome to see them so far as I am con-&#xD;
cerned," said Mr. Howard. "Stand upon your own true&#xD;
dignity my child, and not upon an unsteady heap of notions.&#xD;
Neither lady nor gentleman need be hurt by such inter-&#xD;
course as may be necessary, with people far below them.&#xD;
These men are respectable in their own station, and their&#xD;
being here is nobody's business."&#xD;
So we paid a little comfort for the entertainment of the 1&#xD;
witnesses.&#xD;
Four days was Mr. Howard away; but on the afternoon&#xD;
of the fifth the door opened, and there stood my father on&#xD;
a background of Mr. S. T. Barnabeds.&#xD;
" You have not succeeded, papa !" I exclaimed.&#xD;
"Yes I have Gracie," he answered with a smile,-" what&#xD;
made you say that ."&#xD;
11I thought you looked sober papa."&#xD;
"And how should he look Miss Grace ?" said the un-&#xD;
welcome witness ; "sober, indeed! and at this time of day-&#xD;
too! why what do you take us for?"&#xD;
"Us !" thought I.&#xD;
"Succeeded fairly papa .?"-.&#xD;
"Fairly as far as I have succeeded at all,-this is not&#xD;
quite the end, but I can go on and put up the mill."&#xD;
We were too happy to be sorry for anything; and our&#xD;
graciousness produced a corresponding effect upon Mr. Bar-&#xD;
nabeds. He scattered snuff about the room till I was ex-&#xD;
ceeded, and told absurd stories at which we couldn't help&#xD;
laughing; and considering that we wished him anywhere&#xD;
else, this last was vexatious.&#xD;
. "Queer things these'currents of air, sir," said Mr. Bar-&#xD;
nabeds with a knowing nod of 'his head, while the cool fall&#xD;
wind swept round the house with a roar as of displeasure at&#xD;
being shut out from the breakfast-table,--"very queer&#xD;

things ! Ugh! that's cool," he said nodding to me. "Well&#xD;
sir, up here at my friend Hackett's-..why you may go on&#xD;
the piazza with a lighted candle, and on the roof it would&#xD;
nearabout take two men to hold one man's hair on his&#xD;
head."&#xD;
"Ishould think it highly probable," said my father dryly.&#xD;
"And who would take care of the heads of the two&#xD;
men ?" said .,&#xD;
SWon't you take some corn bread, Mr. Barnabeds ?"&#xD;
said my stepmother, not knowing how he might relish such&#xD;
rejoinders.&#xD;
" No I'm obliged to you Mrs. Howard,-I've been pay-&#xD;
ing my devours to the white-the bread par excellence-&#xD;
no disrespect to the corn variety. As to the other two men&#xD;
Miss Grace, they haven't been up there yet ; so it's impos-&#xD;
sible to say what would happen. I presume  an English.&#xD;
man would predict that they would return unarmed from&#xD;
their violent exertions. By the way Mr. Howard, what a&#xD;
sharp Yankee you've got here for a farmer."&#xD;
"Barrington ?" said my father.&#xD;
"That's the man-he's cute enough to make nutmegs."&#xD;
"And much too honest."-&#xD;
I tell you he's a sharp one, sir. I remarked to him that&#xD;
we had a good load--that was the other day when we went&#xD;
out-alluding to my own weight, which is a trifle above&#xD;
yours sir. And then I said what should we do if the wagon&#xD;
broke down. And the chap looks at me out of the corners&#xD;
of his eyes, 'Well,' he says, 'I guess about the first&#xD;
thing we'd do would be to set it up again--arter you sir.'&#xD;
Ever fish, Mr.-Howard ?"&#xD;
" Never."&#xD;
"Must be good fishing here too-afraid of the proverb&#xD;
sir ?-' a fish at one end and a fool at the other,' you&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"I should certainly prove the last to my own satisfao.&#xD;
tion," said my father--" I'm afraid the fish would be want-&#xD;
ing."&#xD;
"Speaking of wants," said our guest-" you haven't&#xD;
got a pair of old slippers or anything of that sort, Mave&#xD;
you sir ?-these boots are boots."&#xD;
My father looked dubious.&#xD;

"1 have a pair of slippers-if you can wear them," he&#xD;
said under the promptings of truth and hospitality.&#xD;
"O anything's better than these."&#xD;
I was sent for the slippers, and Mr. Barnabeds having&#xD;
left the table, tried them on.&#xD;
"A trifle too large sir," he said pulling the slipper half&#xD;
way on, and then doubling down the heel that his might&#xD;
reach terra-firma-"don't matter, it all comes of my having&#xD;
such a small foot."&#xD;
"That man," said my father, returning to the breakfast-&#xD;
room half an hour after, "is wearing my new slippers slip-&#xD;

RAPE OF THE LOCK.&#xD;
0tF course when our Philadelphia' friends arrived, we felt&#xD;
bound to call and see them; but further than that we&#xD;
could not go. Entertainments were out of our power, and&#xD;
so many were given by other families, that the strangers&#xD;
had small time or inclination for mere tea-drinkings. Thus&#xD;
our intercourse with them rather languished; their visits&#xD;
were seldom, their invitations Mrs. Howard usually declined.&#xD;
"So you wouldn't come to the party !" said Mrs. Willet&#xD;
with a slight air of pique, as she reclined in our dormeuse&#xD;
one morning.&#xD;
"Mr. Howard was not at home to go with us," said my&#xD;
stepmother.&#xD;
"Why didn't you tell me that was the reason !" ex-&#xD;
claimed the lady, "I could have sent you quite 4 body-&#xD;
guard. Plenty of young men that would like nothing&#xD;
better. Well you're coming next week ?"&#xD;
Mrs. Howard shook her head.&#xD;
"Now don't say one word-I shall be really hprt if you'&#xD;
don't. Kate, I know it will do you good, and your husband -&#xD;
will be here to go with you-your father I mean," she&#xD;
added as the flush on Kate's cheeks disentangled her&#xD;
thoughts,-" la, child, I never think what I'm saying., But&#xD;
will you come ?--I know it's good for these girls-I want&#xD;
Grace to come too."&#xD;
It was a plea my stepmother felt, and still she hesitated,&#xD;

"Now if you're thinking of dresses," Mrs. Willet pro-&#xD;
ceeded, "that makes no sort of difference-just come in&#xD;
your country clothes-nothing can be prettier. Simplicity's&#xD;
the true style after all," said the lady arranging her volants.&#xD;
"They are in no danger of adopting any other style,"&#xD;
said Mrs. Howard, who could not forbear smiling.&#xD;
"Yes, but it don't do to be too simple. Now Kate my&#xD;
dear, never be afraid to put a bow of ribbon in your hair,&#xD;
or under yhur collar here,"-she said, touching the little cres-&#xD;
cent which fastened the band of lace round Kate's throat,--&#xD;
" or loop up your sleeves with it-so,--pink, if you like it,&#xD;
or blue would look well-you have such white arms-it's&#xD;
so sweet and becoming. And if you want a dress a little&#xD;
nicer than usual," said Mrs, Willet, while Kate's face took&#xD;
for a moment an expression of proud and somewhat scorn-&#xD;
ful self-respect, "just get tarleton,-it costs very little, and&#xD;
it's the prettiest thing a young girl can wear.-I keep Car-&#xD;
oline in it all winter, (I'm so sorry she's away now,) and&#xD;
when one wears out, I get her another.; Just have it made&#xD;
with three deep tucks, and boddice, or sash if you like, and&#xD;
wear a bow of the same ribbon in your hair. There can't&#xD;
be anything more pretty and suitable. Now goodbye-I&#xD;
shall expect you."&#xD;
"I wonder if she thinks we don't know how to dress&#xD;
ourselves !" said Kate as the door closed.&#xD;
"She means it all kindly," said Mrs. Howard smiling.&#xD;
"I should like to see myself with a bow of ribbon in my&#xD;
hair !" was Kate's uncompromising reply.&#xD;
And if any style could have told Mrs. Willet as much,&#xD;
Kate would probably have adopted it for that evening,-as&#xD;
it was, she had to content herself with the negative teaching&#xD;
of beautiful hair, in its usual quiet arrangement.&#xD;
Mrs. Willet's house was lavishly lined with comfort and&#xD;
money, but the first came in per favour of the second ; for&#xD;
there was no particular, taste or judgment displayed any-&#xD;
where. Yet the purse will do a good deal if you give it&#xD;
carte blanche, and the rooms skewed not the wants of their&#xD;
mistress.&#xD;
She herself in a white turban, came forward from a circle&#xD;
of new and old friends; and receiving us very graciously,&#xD;
carried off Mrs. Howard to the circle; while my father&#xD;

gazed abstractedly at the bisque on the mantelpiece, and&#xD;
Miss Suydam called Kate and me to take seats by her.&#xD;
Unlucky request ! Mrs. Willet presently came up in&#xD;
dismay.&#xD;
"My dear girls what can you possibly be thinking of?&#xD;
Why I never heard of such a thing !"&#xD;
"As what ma'am ?"&#xD;
." Why-bless me !-here you are three ladies on this&#xD;
sofa and no gentlemen even near you."&#xD;
"So much the better," said Miss Suydam-" then they&#xD;
won't overhear our conversation, Mrs. Willet."&#xD;
"Why Jane !-how can you talk so ! here," she said&#xD;
turning about and laying hold of the first three coat-sleeves&#xD;
that came in her way, "your services are wanted in this&#xD;
direction. Mr. Elliot-Miss Howard, Miss Grace Howard&#xD;
-my nephew Mr. La Roche,-Miss Suydam, Captain&#xD;
De Camp. Now for pity's sake don't sit two ladies&#xD;
together." And giving a downward glance at her frock&#xD;
waist, Mrs. Willet walked away.&#xD;
"Is this what you call 'open ranks,' Captain ?" said Miss&#xD;
Suydam as with a gesture of impatience she moved to one&#xD;
corner of the sofa and motioned me to the other. But&#xD;
Kate, not well pleased with such manifest manoeuvres sat&#xD;
in absolute gravity as two of the gentlemen .laughingly&#xD;
placed themselves on either side of her; while Mr. La&#xD;
Roche perceiving that a sixth place was not, folded his&#xD;
arms and taking a position in front of me, remarked,&#xD;
" Well Miss Grace; I suppose I am to stand up and do&#xD;
the agreeable to you."-&#xD;
The resignation of this speech set us all to laughing,&#xD;
and Mrs. Willet looked back quite satisfied with her&#xD;
arrangements. So were also the gentlemen on the sofa;&#xD;
but Mr. La Roche grew weary of some part of his position,&#xD;
and after a few sentences he walked off to bestow his time&#xD;
and talents elsewhere. Thus left to amuse myself the&#xD;
loud talking of sundry people furnished a fair supply of&#xD;
thoughts and infomation-using the common meaning of&#xD;
both. Now a voluble lady would pour out a long string&#xD;
of news and descriptions; or a delicate city-made gentle-&#xD;
4 man would utter compliments and commonplaces in a tone&#xD;
that was perfumed like his pocket-handkerchief. LExcla-&#xD;

mrations of all sorts came with so little discrimination,&#xD;
that one had need to be told, "this" is for joy and this&#xD;
for sorrow." 'Then a 'word from Miss Easy or my step-&#xD;
mother would reach my ear-speaking truth, heart and&#xD;
simplicity; or one of my father's energetic, pointed expres-&#xD;
sions, had all the pleasant effect of a straight line in a pic.&#xD;
ture of curves.&#xD;
"r My dear Kate," said Mrs. Willet while I was drawing&#xD;
comparisons, "do go and sing us something-there's noth-&#xD;
ing so pleasant. as music. Couldn't you sing a duet with&#xD;
somebody to accompany you&#xD;
"No ma'am, I don't think I could," said Kate gravely.&#xD;
"Well anything else then. Come my dear-a prompt&#xD;
compliance !"&#xD;
And as Kate went to the piano, Mrs. Willet with a touch&#xD;
and whisper sent Mr. La Roche in the same direction, while&#xD;
herself fitted about observantly. Then seating herself by&#xD;
my father,&#xD;
" tMr. Howard, I do take such an interest in the love&#xD;
affairs of  young people !"&#xD;
"Do you     said my father at no pains to repress his&#xD;
smile.&#xD;
"0 very great! Amelia," she said looking towards the&#xD;
piano and beckoning her daughter-" tell your cousin to&#xD;
come here."&#xD;
And with another whisper Mr. La Roche was ordered&#xD;
somewhere else.&#xD;
"You see," said Mrs. Willet turning again to my father,&#xD;
"I sent him to turn over the leaves for Kate-I wanted to&#xD;
see if it would disturb her."&#xD;
"Did you ?" said Mr. Howard again.&#xD;
"Yes, and I found it did; so I called him away."&#xD;
My father gave an voluntary glance towards the piano,&#xD;
but the unconscious victim of curiosity had returned to her&#xD;
seat and was talking with Capt. Do Camp.&#xD;
"Very fine young man, that !" said Mrs. Willet.&#xD;
"Is he ?" said my father, who had fallen into the laconics.&#xD;
very fine !"-then raising her voice, " ptami, can&#xD;
you give us a song ? some little military ballad ?"&#xD;
" No ma'am, I never went further than inilitary exercises,''&#xD;

"'-0 but you can sing siething !"&#xD;
No.I can't ma'ni ,' said the Captain bowing.&#xD;
"Dear me !" sai&amp;amp;Mrs. Willet, "that is very extraordi-&#xD;
nary.&#xD;
"Not at all ma'am," sid my father,-.'1 there are many&#xD;
fine young men that have not fine voices-even in the&#xD;
army.   I presume the 'Ha !-hum!' adjurations tend&#xD;
rather to power than sweetness."&#xD;
Mrs. Willet looked puzzled, and my father looked at the&#xD;
ceiling.&#xD;
Nothing up there worth your notice, Mr. Howard,"&#xD;
said Squire Suydam pausing in his perambulation.&#xD;
"Where then ?" said my father with a half smile.&#xD;
Miss Avarintha !" called out Mrs. Bulger across the&#xD;
room,-" Miss Avarintha! look at Squire Suydam-he is&#xD;
absolutely sporting a moustache u"&#xD;
"Squire Suydam!" said the echo-" I would not have&#xD;
thought it!  You, sir, of all men ! Well I am surprised !"&#xD;
The Squire turned, and bowed his acknowledgements.&#xD;
"Daresay ma'am,-don't doubt I shall astonish you a&#xD;
good many times before I die, Miss Avarintha; but as to&#xD;
a moustache, I haven't a sign of such a thing-unless they're&#xD;
catching,-I took a ride with the Captain this morning--&#xD;
maybe that's how it is."               L&#xD;
Nobody laughed louder at this than the gentleman re-&#xD;
ferred to, who evidently thought himself complimented.&#xD;
"'Pale faces' !" said my father musingly and half to&#xD;
himself,-" the Indians would have to invent some new&#xD;
name for us now. If any part of a man's face shews its&#xD;
natural colour, it's because he can't help it." And then,&#xD;
still in an under tone my father proceeded.&#xD;
'"Some are reaped most substantial like a brush,&#xD;
Which makes a nat'ral wit known by the bush;&#xD;
And in my time of'some men I have heard,&#xD;

Think of the world's travelling back to 1630 !"&#xD;
"Well remembered !" said Mr. Suydam laughing, I&#xD;
should think you might have missed some-of the varieties."&#xD;
"Couldn't"- said ny father,-"just look about you.&#xD;
There's a stiletto opposite, and an oval by the fireplace,&#xD;
and triangles enough. to make one think the world is stand-&#xD;
ing on end. My dear sir I can't find any plain surface to&#xD;
look at, but the ceiling,-and there's a bearded Silenus in&#xD;
the mouldings up there !"&#xD;
Mr. Howard roused himself from his gloomy contem-&#xD;
plations and talked briskly with the Squire till the little&#xD;
French clock jogged his elbow,-then he came to where&#xD;
we sat and gave us sundry taps on the shoulder as a gentle&#xD;
intimation that he was ready to go. And Mrs. Willet's&#xD;
arguments failed to convince him that the hour was very,&#xD;
early or our house very near.&#xD;
"This is a great deal pleasanter than all those people !"&#xD;
I said as we walked home; and when by two or three deep&#xD;
exhalations I had purified my lungs from the atmosphere&#xD;
of bouquet and badinage.&#xD;
"Our Katie sang better than her little namesakes,&#xD;
though," said Miss asy with a smile.  We were on our&#xD;
way to the Bird's Nest.&#xD;
"1But Kate is one of these people," I said laughing, "and&#xD;
that is quite different you know, Miss Easy."-&#xD;
"Quite another thing, Gracie."&#xD;
"And yet one cannot help being amused," said Kate-&#xD;
"I'm sure I have been."&#xD;
"What an interesting woman is Mrs. Willet!" said Miss&#xD;
Avarintha from behind; "I think she is quite remarkable."&#xD;
"She certainly is," said my father dryly-" especially in&#xD;
point of judgment."&#xD;
"Yes, especially, as you say sir."&#xD;
" But Miss Easy," said Kate, "you don't speak-don't&#xD;
you like to see people ?"&#xD;
"Yes," said Miss Easy-" some people and sometime&#xD;
yes,-and yet I rather agree with Grace, and like stars b&#xD;
ter than gas-lights."&#xD;

"I'm sure I do," said Kate. " But I believe I like com-&#xD;

"I wish she liked it' letter," said Miss Easy.  "You&#xD;
needn't wear such a grave face Gracie, till you are as old&#xD;
as I am at least."&#xD;
"As old as you are ! dear Miss Easy," said Kate.&#xD;
"Yes," she answered affectionately, "I am what most&#xD;
people call old, Kaie-yes. But I don't feel old, that's&#xD;
one great blessing ; 'd it doesn't trouble me to think of&#xD;
it-that's another."&#xD;
"Isn't Mr. Rodnefcoming home any more, Miss Easy ?"&#xD;
I said: "isn't there afiy hope of his coming soon 2"&#xD;
" I don't know whether Iought to say hope or fear," she&#xD;
said, with a tone that had rost its bright cheerfulness.&#xD;
"Yes, I- expect him-se will not      if his father con-&#xD;
tinues better, but that can liar&#xD;
"Do you think so Miss               te; "that last&#xD;

"It seemed to me less ho                these jour.&#xD;

She was right.     mer Collingwood's health which&#xD;
had at first improve rapidly, declined  t; and he died&#xD;
in Bermuda just a year f  -the time o   leaving Daisy&#xD;
Lea. Close upon this ca     t          dto us a much&#xD;
nearer one--the death of        Foward. We had ex-&#xD;
pected it, he had never been well since the ye.before,--&#xD;
but though surprise might have increased thefieist shock,&#xD;
it could hardly have added to our grief,-that was to be&#xD;
of years.&#xD;
The autumn leaves had meaning in them now, as they&#xD;
fell fluttering from the branches, and thewind took up our&#xD;
half stifled sighs, and breathed them out over the strewn&#xD;
earth, till we could have wept at the expression of our own&#xD;
thoughts. Perhaps it was well for us that smaller cares&#xD;
ceased not at theconming of the great+; though they were&#xD;
felt with double annoyance.&#xD;

dwindled-some sold, others dead; and those still on hand&#xD;
were all too many for the hay. Just in the mowing sea-&#xD;
son Ezra Barrington had been ill and my father away-;&#xD;

would come in with,&#xD;

supposed to be at his wits' end-not at all as if he was.&#xD;
And with a passing shadow on her face my stepmother&#xD;
would -look up and say,&#xD;
"Is all that hay gone already ?"&#xD;
"Ain't three straws left, ma'am, if I was to take a rake&#xD;
and count 'em; and the cows is eatin' the mangers. They&#xD;
do put away the most fodder !" he added with a shake of&#xD;
the head---" there ain't no sense into it."&#xD;
"Well what will you do? Mr. Howard is not coming&#xD;
till Saturday."&#xD;
"Then 'twon't answer to wait for him, that's a fact," said&#xD;
Ezra. "I s'pose I'll just have to make tracks to Squire&#xD;
Bulger's, and back down a, couple of bundles-ain't snow&#xD;
enough for the sled. That'll do 'em till Saturday I reckon;&#xD;
but it beats all my wife's relations to be scant o' hay afore&#xD;
Jinooary."&#xD;
We longed for the spring anditsuyly of grass. There&#xD;
were other things too-for the house, for ourselves,-things&#xD;
wanting and not got. A pair of shoes "if it should be con-'&#xD;
venient to get them,"-or sheets end towels with a condi-&#xD;
tional "never mind." Still my father always said "Have&#xD;
everything you want," or, "Shall I bAng you some. silk&#xD;
dresses." But we knew better, and while so many dollars&#xD;
were needed elsewhere, we could not 'bear to use any for&#xD;
ourselves.&#xD;
Sometimes we did question whether the money was&#xD;
going in the best direction; but if improvements were not&#xD;
finished, how were we to recover the dollars which had be-&#xD;
gun them? how ever-get our heads above water unless the&#xD;
mill set the example? And then we did enjoy things when -&#xD;
they came; and when my father said "there are your shoes,&#xD;
my dear-I hope they will fit,"'I felt even tearfully, the&#xD;
kindness that had found time and means to get them. And&#xD;

piece of stuff, we set to work upon it with much more alac-&#xD;
rity than if it lead come at our call, Yes, there. are pleas-&#xD;

trouble of mind lightened all things else to us. So we worked&#xD;
away, smoothed down all things to him, and kept them&#xD;
from every other eye and ear. By dint of carefulness, our&#xD;

nice clothes long kept their good appearance; and though&#xD;
people knew we had had losses, they were far from guessing&#xD;
how nearly it was low water with our dollars. While we&#xD;
said privately,&#xD;
" Oh filling out, oh filling in !&#xD;

And so amid the changing light of doubtful weather, that                                 CHAPTER        XIX,&#xD;
year which had seen the end of so many things, drew near&#xD;

CHRISTMAS day passed in whirlwinds&#xD;
-Uwe within doors were doubly quiet for&#xD;

doubts whether we should receife-whet&#xD;

contrast with former years,--how keenly i&#xD;
Mr. Howard came in with a paper of candid&#xD;

I would rather he had forgotten the day.&#xD;
Towards evening the wind lulled, and thou&#xD;

now, it was too roundabout a way for our fr&#xD;
but we had struck out a little foot- ath which&#xD;
wood and meadow brought us to the Nest&#xD;
and though its narrowness left our dresses to&#xD;
fit of the snow, it was too pretty to be aban&#xD;
a trifle. So literally this time, we " made t&#xD;

then-whirling away-its course marked by the light ihite&#xD;
cloud which if raised.&#xD;
The chickadees were in full force, and they alone broke&#xD;
the stillness: while their black caps told as beautifully&#xD;
upon the waste of snow, as their merry notes- amid the&#xD;
universal hush. We stopped to look at them. Upon a&#xD;
bush close to our. path there were perhaps a dozen-in&#xD;
every variety of attitude and position; the little black&#xD;
heads turned up, and down, and sideways ; and having&#xD;
from their round, full-feathered plumpness, a look particu-&#xD;
larly comical. While one bird was perpendicular, another&#xD;
horizontal, one perched and another swinging beneath a&#xD;
branch, their heads never at rest; and from every twig in&#xD;
succession came the joyous "Chick-a-dee-dee-dee !" And&#xD;
all the time their little gladsome eyes watched us-half as&#xD;
it seemed in curiosity, half in commiseration that we too&#xD;
were not Blackcaps. One might have fancied that they&#xD;
sang,&#xD;
"Chick-a-dee-dee-dee 1--&#xD;
Oshel 0 see !&#xD;
Would@t you be, wouldn't you be,&#xD;
Likeme? like me?-'a-&#xD;
Chick-a-dee-dee-dee !"&#xD;
I think if they had really put the question Kate and I&#xD;
might have answered "yes"; but with a chirp, and a flutter&#xD;
that showered the snow from its resting-place, the flock&#xD;
sprang to their wings-if I may use the expression-and&#xD;
we silently walked on. It was time ; the light came more&#xD;
and more askance, and neither for birds nor bad walking&#xD;
must we loiter now. Yet fast as we step if, is not so light&#xD;
that we cannot see the glimmering fire through the white&#xD;
muslin curtains as we reach the cottage.&#xD;
"How those curtains look like Miss Easy !" said Kate,&#xD;
-" simple, pure, and. quiet as she is."&#xD;
And transparent to 'the light within,"' I added.&#xD;
"Yes,- wish every one had as bright a light, and as&#xD;
gentle a medium for it to shine through. But then the&#xD;
world would be too pleasant. Ah Gracie! we shall not&#xD;
see many such this side 'the kingdom.' How evidently&#xD;
she is bound for it ! ow plainly the expression of her face&#xD;
tells which way she looking !"&#xD;

The cottage was deprived of its green setting, and to the&#xD;
rough stone walls the snow clung in patches, and the roof&#xD;
bore its white burden with very grave quietness.: yet the&#xD;
many little tracks upon the walk where no other feet had&#xD;
yet been, told of the revels of chickadees;' and the elm&#xD;
waved its long branches not cheerlessly in a late gleam&#xD;
of sunlight, which came from the west, a very "beam of&#xD;
tranquillity."&#xD;
We had long given up knocking at Miss Easy's door;&#xD;
so opening it gently, Kate and I passed in and entered' the&#xD;
parlour. The room had that soft, uncertain light---the&#xD;
interregnum between sun and fire--which is the very&#xD;
atmosphere" of dreamland,-even the fire seemed weaving&#xD;
visions, as it flickered and flashed and sighed and had the&#xD;
conversation all to itself. Nobody heeded it;- and the&#xD;
bright coals fell and the white ashes gathered, and nobody&#xD;
heeded them.&#xD;
Miss Easy was not there, but a great chair stood before&#xD;
the hearth, and in it was Mr. Rodney. We recognised him&#xD;
at once, though with his head sunk in his hands, he sat like&#xD;
one whose thoughts are travelling peInfully the long-quitted&#xD;
roads of former life; but after one glance at him Kate and&#xD;
I looked at each other-yes, it was Mr. Rodney himself.&#xD;
Wolfgang lay near him, but the doges pricked-up ears were&#xD;
quickly lowered, and his tail gave us a quiet greeting as&#xD;
his head went down to its former attitude of repose. We&#xD;
stood still a few moments, and then were about to go as&#xD;
softly as we had come, when Miss Easy entered by another&#xD;
door.&#xD;
"Why my dear girls!" she said, " where did you&#xD;
come from? I am so glad to see you, yes. And you&#xD;
took this long walk in the snow to wish me a merry&#xD;
ChristmasI But what in the world were you going away&#xD;
for ?"&#xD;
"Not because of me, I hopee" said Mr. Rodney, as he&#xD;
came forward and gave us a greeting that had all the&#xD;
warmth of old times. "Friends should nosyrun away from&#xD;
each other after so long a separation," he added more&#xD;
sadly.&#xD;
"Don't they look well ?" said Mi jEasy, coaxing the&#xD;
fire into a bright blaze and then,comin ack to untie our&#xD;

hoods,-" don't they look well? and haven't they grown&#xD;
and improved ?-yes."&#xD;
Mr. Rodney smiled-&#xD;
"They certainly have, Miss Easy, and they look well;&#xD;
but-is nothing the matter at home ? is all well there too ?"&#xD;
"Yes, perfectly," Kate ,said; and I looked up rather&#xD;
wonderingly and asked,&#xD;
"«Why? Mr. Rodney-what makes you say that ?"&#xD;
"Something in the eyes I was looking at, Gracie," he.&#xD;
answered; "but perhaps the shade was in my own."&#xD;
"There mustn't be a shade in anybody's eyes," said Miss&#xD;
Easy,-" I am so glad to see you all here together, once&#xD;
more !-yes. And now Katie love, sit down and tell me&#xD;
how you have spent this long stormy day; yes-I want to&#xD;
know."&#xD;
"The day has not been so very long, Miss Easy-con-&#xD;
sidering its quietness and the little Christmas feeling that I&#xD;
have had,-we were too busy to do much in the way of&#xD;
present-making. But your engravings looked like Santa&#xD;
Claus, and gave.us a great deal of pleasure."&#xD;
"And you see what a present I had," said Miss Easy-&#xD;
looking with glistening eyes at her guest. "I found him&#xD;
here this morning just as you did this afternoon, yes; and&#xD;
I have hardly recollected what the day waste And only&#xD;
think ! there lay Wolfgang at his feet, and he hasn't stirred&#xD;
from -him since. I declare," said Miss Easy wiping her&#xD;
eyes, "it quite touched me."&#xD;
Mr. Rodney laid his hand upon the dog's head, which&#xD;
Wolfgang acknowledged by one of his looks of mute affec-&#xD;
tion, and for a little the fire crackled and blazed unheeded&#xD;
as before. Then our two friends spoke again, in tones low&#xD;
at first, and very grave, as if each read the other's thoughts;&#xD;
but brightening and strengthening as word and eye almost,&#xD;
passed from the ruins of earth to "that city which hath&#xD;
foundations."&#xD;
And Kate and I, listening with charmed ears, noticed not&#xD;
the waning light, till Miss Avarintha and candles came in,&#xD;
--then we started up in surprise at our own forgetfulness.&#xD;
"Now just sit down !" said the lady, "I didn't know you&#xD;
were here, and I've twenty things to say to you. Are&#xD;
your father and        ) riealth ?"&#xD;
&#xD;
"Yes ma'am," said Kate, "but we must take another&#xD;
time to hear the twenty things. We have staid too long&#xD;
already--it is quite late."&#xD;
"You need not look so anxiously at the window," said&#xD;
Mr. Rodney-" you will not be afraid with me, if it is a&#xD;
little dark."&#xD;
"No, but we are not going with you, Mr. Collin wood,"&#xD;
said Kate-" at least you are not going with us. We are&#xD;
not at all afraid-it is not far."&#xD;
" O no !" I said; "and you must be very tired-you&#xD;
cannot want a walk, Mr. Rodney."&#xD;
"I am sure I shall take one, whether you let me go with&#xD;
you or not. I must go to the Lea to-night, Miss Easy," he&#xD;
added, turning to her, i' but you shall see me again in the&#xD;
morning."&#xD;
" Why should you go there, of all places ?" said Miss&#xD;
Bain-" it will only make you feel sad,-you ought to stay&#xD;
here and get up your spirits. It isn't right to indulge your-&#xD;
self so-a pensive state of mind is very unhealthy."&#xD;
No one answered this speech, but after a minute's silence&#xD;
Miss Easy said, gently laying her hand on his arm,&#xD;
" You will come back to-morrow ? yes, you promise me&#xD;
that? then I will not keep you longer, for I know these&#xD;
children want to be off."&#xD;
And Wolfgang roused himself to follow us, keeping close&#xD;
to his master as if he feared another separation.&#xD;
The clouds were scattered now, and the new moon's&#xD;
faint light just served to show the snow's full beauty.&#xD;
My thoughts went back to our first Christmas in that&#xD;
region-when we had dined at Daisy Lea, and had walked&#xD;
home in such a night-but how different! Perhaps Kate's&#xD;
mind had taken the same course, for after a while she&#xD;
said,&#xD;
"It is strange that the snow cannot j| p its lightness,&#xD;
even where there has been no heavy weght to press it&#xD;
down!"&#xD;
"And what reality were you looking at through that&#xD;
shadow ?" said Mr. Rodney.&#xD;
"I was thinking of a time years ago, when we said the&#xD;
newfallen snow was like our own spirits," said Kate with a&#xD;
scarcely perceptible sigh.&#xD;

"You have told me nothing of this long year as it has&#xD;
passed at Glen Luna. I know from Miss Easy that you&#xD;
have been well, but what have the months brought besides'&#xD;
health ?"&#xD;
"A little experience-a little more of real life than we&#xD;
ever had before," Kate answered.&#xD;
"The shade was not all in my own eyes then."&#xD;
We had taken the road home, for the little path was too&#xD;
narrow and dark for pleasant walking at ,that hour; and'&#xD;
now we were passing the same slopes and fields that we&#xD;
had first seen in all the luxuriance of summer dress. Un-.&#xD;
broken white now, the bare trees -cast the faintest of&#xD;
shadows, and almost looked shadowy themselves in that&#xD;
- pale light.&#xD;
"Miss Kate," said Mr. Rodney, "the snow will as you&#xD;
say lose its lightness-will melt away entirely; and yet the&#xD;
earth is thereby much more fertilized than if that reflector&#xD;
for the sunbeams were abiding."&#xD;
"Yes," she answered, though her voice trembled a little,&#xD;
"I know--I feel that to be true. And yet-".&#xD;
" And yet," he said gently, "sometimes you forget what&#xD;
Baxter says-' there is no mirth like the mirth of believers,&#xD;
which faith doth fetch from the blood of Christ, and from&#xD;
the promises of the word, and from experiences of mercy,&#xD;
and from the serious fore-apprehensions of our everlasting&#xD;
blessedness.'"&#xD;
"Forget it because I have so little of it," Kate said pres-&#xD;
ently.&#xD;
"Well," he answered, in the same pleasant, encouraging&#xD;
tone, "it is something to know what we want,-it is more&#xD;
to know how the want may be supplied; 'but the arch will&#xD;
fail of its purpose without the key-stone. Let faith bind&#xD;
the remedy to the need, and the work is perfect. The lack&#xD;
of this makes many a half-way christian; and it often hin-&#xD;
ders the realization of that promise-' They that fear the&#xD;
Lord shall not want any good thing."'&#xD;
" Will you come in Mr. Rodney ?" said Kate. as we&#xD;
reached our own door.&#xD;
"Not to-night."&#xD;
&#xD;
"You have done us more than one kindness by taking&#xD;
this long walk !"&#xD;
" And you are not going away any more !" I said. "I&#xD;
am so glad !"&#xD;
" We will not talk of that now, Gracie, but I trust your&#xD;
power of remembrance could stretch over more than one&#xD;
year-if I should try it."&#xD;
I was not quite satisfied with the indication of these last&#xD;
words; and when Miss Bain paid us a visit next morning&#xD;
I repeated my remark about Mr. Rodney's staying at&#xD;
home.&#xD;
"Bless me !" was the somewhat disdainful reply,--" the&#xD;
idea of his doing anything half so wise !"&#xD;
" And what foolish thing does he mean to do ?" said Mrs.&#xD;
Howard.&#xD;
" Why-of course that's as people take it,-but here he's&#xD;
just come home in great affliction-or ought to be-and&#xD;
instead of visiting about among his friends aid trying to&#xD;
get his spirits up-taking a little relaxation you know, Mrs.&#xD;
Howard-he's going straight off to college or somewhere;&#xD;
and the next thing I hear will be that he is dying of a pain&#xD;
in his chest, or some other mathematical disorder."&#xD;
"I hope not," said my stepmother, quite unable to re-&#xD;
press a smile.&#xD;
"But Mrs. Howard," said Miss Avarintha-" really&#xD;
ma'am you ought not to laugh,-just imagine him bending&#xD;
all day over his books-and he a young man of such erect&#xD;
carriage and symmetrical proportions! Why it's perfectly&#xD;
melancholy !"&#xD;
" Very melancholy indeed, if it injures his health; but I&#xD;
should think he had sense enough to guard against that."&#xD;
"My dear ma'am he hasn't a bit !-he told me gravely&#xD;
this morning that he had no time to lose, or throw away,&#xD;
or something-complimentary to his friends too, as I said.&#xD;
Just think of it-!-and he so young too! why he might&#xD;
settle down and get married and study for a profession&#xD;
afterwards."  .&#xD;
"If he cared nothing about his wife."-&#xD;
"If he did! Now Mrs. Howard were you ever married&#xD;
to a man who hadn't been through college? iad Mr. Rod-&#xD;
ney has been part through, besides."&#xD;

riage than after."&#xD;
"Why ? for pity's sake ?"&#xD;
' More time and fewer claims upon it."&#xD;
"You don't mean that people oughtn't to read nor any-&#xD;
thing of that sort after they're married ?-why there's Mr.;&#xD;
Howard spends hours and hours at his books, I'm sure,-.&#xD;
didn't you say so once when I asked you? Why if a man&#xD;
did nothing but look after his wife, what would become of.&#xD;
his mind ma'am ?"&#xD;
"His wife's mind might oftener become something than&#xD;
it does now," said my stepmother. "But I am no advocate&#xD;
for idleness in any department, Miss Avarintha; though I'&#xD;
must say that I think intellectual men often slight too&#xD;
much their non-intellectual duties. They are so busy ma-&#xD;
king a clear #ay for their heads, that the walk of their prac-&#xD;

"Then what would you have Mr..Rodney do ?--suppose&#xD;
his health fails."&#xD;
"I'm sure I was laying down no rules for Mr. Rodney,"%&#xD;
said Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
" No ma'am-of course ! but I want your opinion-young&#xD;
men in general, for instane."&#xD;
"That's a pretty large for instance.  I think 'young&#xD;
men in general' are in no danger from over application to&#xD;
anything-the more they study the better."&#xD;
"My dear Mrs. Howard! you really are too evasive.&#xD;
Should a man give up his books when he gets a wife ?"&#xD;
"By no means; but he should see to it that they are not'&#xD;
obstacles in the way of his wife's happiness."&#xD;
"As if they could be !" said Miss Bain indignantly, for.&#xD;
she was lady-patroness of books in general-" why Mrs..&#xD;
Howai-d, I have always maintained that you were the hap-&#xD;
piest woman in the world, because Mr. Howard was. so&#xD;
fond ofstudy and all that ! A pretty life a woman must.&#xD;
lead whenlher husband's head is nothing but a head! It&#xD;
had better be something else and be in the clouds."&#xD;

comprehension, neither was it explained, but she said.-&#xD;

" We are talking in the abstract, you know: if.you ap-&#xD;
ply all my words to myself, I shall have to stop. But I&#xD;
have seen many a married student, and have seen him-&#xD;
with his head in the clouds as you say-go stumbling along&#xD;
over the obstacles which had accumulated through his ab.&#xD;
straction, and hardly know what they were or how they&#xD;
came."&#xD;
"Very well, and what harm then ?"&#xD;
"I did not say harm to him; but Miss Avarintha I have&#xD;
seen his wife trying to remove those obstacles, or with her&#xD;
own unassisted strength to get herself and her children over&#xD;
them. I can tell you it is a sight which might almost dis-&#xD;
gust one with books in general! Let a man study-but oh&#xD;
let him study his wife first !"&#xD;

cheek and made her voice tremble, obtained  my step-&#xD;

extraordinary person! But do you ever tell Mr. Howard&#xD;
all this ?"&#xD;
"Sometimes-when I think he's in danger," said Mrs.&#xD;
Howard with a smile so sweet and placid that it turned the&#xD;
edge of Miss Bain's curiosity.&#xD;
"Bless me !" said that lady suddenly coming back to the&#xD;
starting point,  why if Mr. Rodney heard all this- he'd&#xD;
kill himself right away !"&#xD;

long breath she too came back,-" I certainly have advised&#xD;
nosuch desperate measures."&#xD;
No ma'am, but he wants to know so much you see;&#xD;
and if he thought this was his only chance,,it's my belief&#xD;
he'd study himself to death in six months."&#xD;
.Maybe he does not intend to get married so soon,"&#xD;
said my stepmother smiling, "and if a few more months&#xD;
dilute the poison, it may not prove fatal. And you; may&#xD;
tell him from me, that instead of having no chance to learn&#xD;
anything after he is married,-the chances will be so many&#xD;

girls I ever saw in my life. But now you're coming to&#xD;
dine with us to-morrow, and you musn't say ,one wor of&#xD;

" I will be very good," said Mrs. Howard.  ,&#xD;
"Because you see Easy's very anxious-arid so am I of&#xD;
course-that he should rest himself; and he thinks so much&#xD;
of your sense and all that, Mrs. Howard, I'm sure he'd do&#xD;
just what you told him to.".&#xD;
My stepmother shook her head, as if she :were sure of no,&#xD;
such thing.      .&#xD;
"Who will take care of the Lea now ?-Mrs. Crown as&#xD;
usual?"&#xD;
"O dear no !" said Miss Avarintha, "Mr. Rodney has&#xD;
nothing t9   with it 'now, you know,-it belongs to his&#xD;
brother-    ill Collingwood.  At least he was Carvill&#xD;
Collingwood, but he only calls himself Carvill at pres-&#xD;

while she spoke.&#xD;
" Yes, sir, so I think-I can't say I'm fond of very long&#xD;
surnames,-one or two syllables is plenty."&#xD;
"But I didn't know this brother was alive ?"' said Mrs.&#xD;
Howard.-.&#xD;
"'Dear me yes! Very fine young man too, only wild-&#xD;
but that one can't help."&#xD;
"I shouldn't think he would care to live at the Lea then,"&#xD;
said Kate.&#xD;
"Not going to, my dear; oh no-he'd think himself&#xD;
buried alive. He'll, only come down there now and then&#xD;
to kill the birds his father was so fond of. Mr. Rodney&#xD;
will take away all that belongs to him at once, which isn't&#xD;
very much to be sure; and what Mrs. Crown will do I am&#xD;
not informed-probably she will choose to reside some-&#xD;
where in the neighbourhood, and perhaps she'll stay at the&#xD;
Lea house still, if Mr. Carvill makes it worth her while.&#xD;
But that's not likely, for these harebrained young men&#xD;
never know what to do with their property. Easy's quite&#xD;

"I don't wish to be waked up," said my father knitting&#xD;
his brows and walking out of the room.&#xD;
"Mr. Howard is so strict," said Miss Bain laughing.&#xD;
"But Mr. Carvill is going to be married Kate, so you&#xD;
needn't even look that way. Bless me !-what a face!&#xD;
why he's not a Turk or a Mussulman, child,-and if he was,&#xD;
I'm sure the Turks are very handsome, and turbans very&#xD;
becoming, I can tell you there's many a girl would jump&#xD;
at Carvill, for as wild as he is."&#xD;
" I a~mnnot at all allied to the kangaroos," said Kate.&#xD;
."But who is the jumper in this case Miss Avarintha ?"&#xD;
said I.&#xD;
"Jumper !" said Miss Bain in high indignation-" what&#xD;
in the world is the child thinking of!.-.kangaroos indeed!&#xD;
the idea of calling Clemence St. Cloud a jerbo&#xD;
"Nay we did not touch upon that species said Kate,&#xD;
"she is French then ?"&#xD;
"To be sure she is, so you'd better not laugh at her.&#xD;
She's a most exquisite young creature they say-brought&#xD;
up in a convent,-so I suppose she knows everything."&#xD;
"Well but is she coming to the Lea too ?" said my&#xD;
stepmother.&#xD;
"Bless me, ma'am, how can I tell?-no I should think&#xD;
not,-from all I hear of hershe's not the sort of person to&#xD;
run about after her husband."&#xD;
" Only to jump at him," said I.&#xD;
Miss Bain had half a mind to be vexed, but we laughed&#xD;
so heartily that she could but laugh too, protesting that&#xD;
we were "as ridiculous as possible;" and so we parted in&#xD;
good humour.&#xD;

CHAPTER XX.&#xD;
Something like home that is not home is to be desired; it is found in the&#xD;
house of a frend.-TEMPLE.&#xD;
FEAR there was a touch of selfishness in our feelings&#xD;
I next'"day, when we heard that Miss Bain had a head-&#xD;
ache. Miss Easy and Mr. Collingwood were alone in the&#xD;
little parlor ,and the explanation of this circumstance was,&#xD;
truth to s , very satisfactory: we could be sorry for the&#xD;
invalId but not for ourselves. So long as we were very&#xD;
bright, her company and conversation came not amiss; but&#xD;
in those circumstances where the tongue-"that little horse&#xD;
that is perpetually running away,"-requires- the guiding&#xD;
hand of nice feeling, at the very time when Miss Easy was&#xD;
most lovely, Miss Avarintha was least endurable.&#xD;
Moreover when dinner was served, I discovered that she&#xD;
would have been too many in another respect. We were&#xD;
such a pleasant number as matters stood,-mamma and I&#xD;
on one side, Mr. Rodney and Kate on the other: my father&#xD;
armed with the carving knife ; while opposite to him sat&#xD;
Miss Easy with a face of such pleased affection, that none&#xD;
but those who knew her well, would have guessed that she&#xD;
had always at least'one thought upstairs. I felt reproved&#xD;
for my secret joy every time I looked at her-get rid of it&#xD;
I could not.&#xD;
. An acute observer who had surveyed that happy dinner&#xD;
table, would have thought none of us in exuberant spirits;&#xD;
and yet would have judged that we were possessed of as much&#xD;
comfort, of as much counterbalancing good, as man needs to&#xD;
bear the evil patiently,-and so we were. The wind went&#xD;
noisily about the house, as it had been the world's turmoil:&#xD;
dark clouds that would have done honour to November's&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLLARS AND CENTS.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
moodiness drifted in close order across the sky, like threat-&#xD;
eners of our peace. Yet did not the world enter, nor the&#xD;
darkened light without do aught but brighten the worl&#xD;
within,-we were very happy. Quietly, soberly, as people&#xD;
who have tasted life must be, to be happy at all; though&#xD;
with Kate and me the taste was half sympathetic, and in&#xD;
return the older members of the company caught from us&#xD;
somewhat of the smack'of young pleasure that yet lingered&#xD;
on our lips.&#xD;
"Sous lee aimables lois dont l'amiti6 noun lie;&#xD;
Et lee biens et les maux, tout doit se partager:&#xD;
Mais quel partage heureux I le bien sy mutiplie,&#xD;
Et le mal y devint leger."&#xD;
There is something very fair in the unbroken glow of a&#xD;
summer day; but fairer yet, and of more interest, is that&#xD;
play of light and shade when the sun cannot quite banish&#xD;
the clouds, nor the clouds refuse to admit ' influence.&#xD;
When the shadows that-fall are soft-and fleet .,and every&#xD;
touch of light is burnished by the strong hand of contrast.&#xD;
My stepmother went to see the sick lady after dinner;&#xD;
and leaving my father and Mr. Rodney to finish their con-&#xD;
versation, Miss Easy walked into the drawing-room again,&#xD;
followed by Kate and me. The short day was just ending;&#xD;
but as if to make amends for its past cloudiness, the sky&#xD;
was now perfectly clear, and the wind had gone after his&#xD;
playthings.&#xD;
"How long does Mr. Rodney stay, Miss Easy ?" said&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
"He goes to-morrow."&#xD;
" To-morrow !"&#xD;
We watched the passing light almost in silence; but&#xD;
when the sun had set, and we were looking for darkness,&#xD;
there came through the bay-window a strip of the fairest,&#xD;
softest radiance, that ever fell upon a twilight world.' It&#xD;
glimmered faintly upon the window, but within-upon&#xD;
carpet and chair and wall-the ray had not even that&#xD;
approach to gayety,--it breathed the very spirit of pure con.&#xD;
solation. We looked at each other and then at the western&#xD;
sky. There hung, just over the horizon, a slender crescent,&#xD;
coming forth from the cool white light of the sky most&#xD;
beautifully--like a diamond in silver setting ; and front&#xD;

point to point, faintly mapped out, the eye could just trace&#xD;
the outline of its future greatness. Steadily it shone in&#xD;
upon us in its descent, and for a while we watched it almost&#xD;
as steadily.&#xD;
asMy dear Kate," said Miss Easy then, " what are you&#xD;
thinking of? the moon?"&#xD;
"No ma'am, my thoughts had descended to earth."&#xD;
"Come here and let me see you."&#xD;
Kate left her stand at the back of Miss Easy's chair, and&#xD;
kneeling down at her feet lent her face to her friend's kind&#xD;
and somewhat thoughtful scrutiny.&#xD;
" Well dear Miss Easy," she said, "can your mind find&#xD;
the path by which mine came down? I don't think I&#xD;
could direct you to it."&#xD;
" Tell me where it came to and I will try," said her friend&#xD;
smiling. "Katie, your eyes are just like the channels&#xD;
about those islands Mr. Rodney was telling me of-only&#xD;
there are no hidden reefs."&#xD;
"What islands ?" said Kate laughing.&#xD;
" The Bermudas."&#xD;
"Was he telling you abopt them? 0 I wish I had heard&#xD;
it. I wanted very much to ask him but"-&#xD;
"Wanted to ask ms what ?" said the gentleman in ques-&#xD;
tion as. he came up end placed himself in Kate's former&#xD;
position behind Miss Easy.&#xD;
Kate hesitated.&#xD;
"I was thinking-.-I was wishing that I could ask you-&#xD;
that you would tell us something about Bermuda," she&#xD;
said in rather a low voice, as if afraid of giving pain. And&#xD;
to that he answered.&#xD;
"I love to think of it Miss Kate-it is very pleasant to&#xD;
me. What was your question?"&#xD;
"Sit down here Katie and tell him," said Miss Easy, "I&#xD;
am going upstairs,"&#xD;
"I don't know enough about it to ask questions," said&#xD;
Kate as she took the oifered chair, while Mr. Rodney left&#xD;
his stand for one by the mantelpiece ; "I have just a gen-&#xD;
eral idea of a group of islands east of the United States.&#xD;
Are they remarkable for anything ?"&#xD;
"Very remarkable, both for beauty and situation. You&#xD;
are so fond of this little inland lake Miss Kate, what would&#xD;
&#xD;
you say to a lake in the midst of'the ocean?-its boundary&#xD;
a coral reef, its horizon one low water-line. Well Gracie&#xD;
--you look at me as if I were telling travellers' wonders,&#xD;
and not very credible ones neither."&#xD;
"Because I can't quite understand them sir, Was there&#xD;
ever such a place ?"&#xD;
"There was when I came from Bermuda-the islands lie&#xD;
in just such a one. It is a singular shoal, some twenty-&#xD;
three miles by thirteen, the deep sea on every side of it,&#xD;
and the nearest point of land almost six hundred miles off."&#xD;
"And the lake is on top of this shoal ?" said Kate.&#xD;
"Precisely. And the reefs which surround it are so&#xD;
high as to keep out entirely the action of the sea."&#xD;
"And how near to the islands is this reef?"&#xD;
"The outer edge of it? The distance varies very much&#xD;
-ten miles off in some places. The islands are low and&#xD;
always green-indeed there is no climate there but of spring&#xD;
-t is one of the prettiest evening scenes you can imagine;&#xD;
and the little boats go gliding about the narrow channels&#xD;
like a train of fairy things."&#xD;
" O Mr. Rodney-" I said, "that is just what I wanted&#xD;
to ask-those channels"-&#xD;
"Are among the islands," said Kate,--" didn't you under-&#xD;
stand ?"&#xD;
"Of course ! where else could they be! But Miss&#xD;
Easy said that Kate's eyes were just like those channels-&#xD;
except the reefs.-is there anything peculiar about them&#xD;
Mr. Rodney ?"&#xD;
He smiled.&#xD;
"They are peculiarly clear and pure Gracie-I presume&#xD;
that is what Miss Easy was thinking of, , But do'you know&#xD;
that you have a great fondness for indefinite pronouns ?"&#xD;
"How have I? what do you mean sir ?"&#xD;
"What was the antecedent to your 'them'? 'eyes' or&#xD;
reefs' or channelss'? If I had been a stranger to all three&#xD;
I might have been puzzled."&#xD;
" I know," said I laughing-" papa talks to me about it&#xD;
sometimes. But then you always understand everybody&#xD;
Mr. Rodney.".&#xD;
"I generally understand ywou," he said with a smile.&#xD;

water that the islands can be reached at all. When a ship&#xD;
comes to the boundary a negro pilot takes her in charge,&#xD;
and leaning over the prow to keep close watch of the reefs&#xD;
with which the lake is studded, he guides her safely through&#xD;
the narrow channel."&#xD;
"It must be a lovely place !" said Kate, who by dint of&#xD;
strong imagination had conjured up a visionary Bermuda&#xD;
in the fire; and was surveying it intently. "I almost won-&#xD;
der you did not want to stay there, Mr. Rodney."&#xD;
"That could hardly be !" he said with that quick light of&#xD;
the eye which sudden and strong feeling often wrought in&#xD;
him-" that could hardly be !"-then adding more quietly,&#xD;
"if you knew me better Miss Kate, you would better ap-&#xD;
preciate my love of friends and home.&#xD;
" But one might make friends-there are plenty of peo-&#xD;
ple there."&#xD;
"Plenty of strangers-that give one as much of a home&#xD;
feeling as does the wild ocean outside the reef! they&#xD;
seemed like a barrier between me and everything that I&#xD;
cared about." He paused and then said in a lower and&#xD;
graver .ne,.&#xD;
"Yes, there are people enough there, and in some moods&#xD;
one might, as you say, make friends. But if one knew&#xD;
them all, home is not easily transferrable,-even the eye&#xD;
wearies, of strange beauties, and longs for those which if&#xD;
more common are far more dear. I would have bartered&#xD;
all the graceful, unfading loveliness of Bermuda, for one&#xD;
look at the roughest view in this neighbourhood, in the&#xD;
wildest storm that ever bedecked it with clouds and snow."&#xD;
"And yet--"&#xD;
"And yet I love to think of 'it now? Yes, very much,&#xD;
but not for the sake of the place itself-there are some&#xD;
associations that can endear anything, and some recollec-&#xD;
tions that are much more gladdening than forgetfulness."&#xD;
"There are a great many false notions on that subject,"&#xD;
said my father suddenly pausing his.steps by Kate's chair;&#xD;
"I am glad they are not yours. In 'throwing off' and 'for-&#xD;
getting' some cause of sorrow, how often hidden blessings&#xD;
and comfort go with it. While if men would seek them&#xD;
out, they would by and by get on the bright side of the&#xD;

How sadly the shadow was on Mr. Rodney's face for a&#xD;
moment, ere he answered,&#xD;
"1 cannot say that for myself Mr. Howard, not always&#xD;
-sometimes I am selfish enough to feel the cloud far too&#xD;
much-assured as I am that to be out of this world, is not,&#xD;
for a christian, to be beyond the pale of all good, but of&#xD;
all evil."&#xD;
" How many people," said my father, "look upon heaven&#xD;
as a man whose house is burning looks at the rest of the&#xD;
world,-he must leave his house, but what to do elsewhere?&#xD;
I was struck with that, almost painfully, the last time I was&#xD;
in Philadelphia. 'Poor Dr.----' said a clergyman to me,&#xD;
speaking of the late minister of the  St. church ! Sir&#xD;
I wondered if the man thought ' the promise of none&#xD;

commentary upon his own ! I was happy to know that the&#xD;
former was undoubted."&#xD;
"You remember papa," said Kate, "what Cotton Mather&#xD;
says of old Governour Bradstreet--'death seemed rather&#xD;
conferred upon him, than life taken from him."'&#xD;
"Ay," said my father, turning off again to hit walk,&#xD;
"but it is much easier to see some people's mistakes than&#xD;
to imitate other people's excellencies."&#xD;
I had a presentiment that the headache would go off by&#xD;
tea-time, and to be sure it did. Miss Bain was not only&#xD;
able, but very glad to take her place at the table, and as&#xD;
large a share as possible in the conversation-to make up&#xD;
for lost time.&#xD;
"What are you going to do ?" said my father seizing a&#xD;
time when he thought the subject matter at the other side&#xD;
of the fireplace seemed pretty engrossing. "You don't&#xD;
mean to turn counsellor Mr. Rodney ?"&#xD;
"Not 'at law,' certainly."&#xD;
"That's well-though perhaps I shouldn't say so ; but it&#xD;
always seems to meas if the atmosphere of other people's&#xD;
quarrels must be unwholesome. But what are you going&#xD;
to make of yourself then? what profession have you&#xD;
chosen?"&#xD;
" That one sir for which a man is least of all self-made-.&#xD;
the church."&#xD;
"But my dear Mr. -Rodney !" said Miss Bain suddenly&#xD;

turning round, "the church! I always thought you were a&#xD;
dissenter ?"&#xD;
"From what Miss Avarintha ?" said Mr. Rodney.&#xD;
"From what ?" said the lady, dubiously eyeing her an-&#xD;
tagonist; "well that is a question! Why the established&#xD;
church of course."&#xD;
"And what is the established church of America " he&#xD;
answered with a smile.&#xD;
"Really sir," said Miss Bain a little piqued, "I did not&#xD;
know that you were in the habit of.evading a fair ques-&#xD;
tion."&#xD;
"It doesn't so much matter what he dissents from after&#xD;
- all, ma'am," said Mr. Howard, ''if he only lives up to&#xD;
Bunyan's standard. You remember Miss Bain that *'Chris-&#xD;
tian saw the figure of a very grave person hang up against&#xD;
the wall; and this was the fashion of it: it had eyes lifted&#xD;
up to heaven, the best of books was in its hand, the law&#xD;
of truth was written upon its lips, the world was behind its&#xD;
back; it stood as if it pleaded with men, and a crown of&#xD;
gold did hang over its head."'&#xD;
" To be sure," said Miss Bain half involuntarily.&#xD;
" Well Mr. Rodney," said my father, "I am glad that&#xD;
such is your choice. I only hope they will build you a&#xD;
church at the other horn of the lake, to keep Mr. Ellis in&#xD;
countenance. We can't afford to lose you permanently&#xD;
from this neighbourhood."&#xD;
" Ah sir !" said Miss Easy, "that would be too pleasant!&#xD;
Yes sir, I wish I could see that !"&#xD;
The wish and the tone of loving interest were well paid&#xD;
for, if a look could pay.&#xD;
"It would be almost too pleasant a thing to happen, dear&#xD;
Miss Easy," he said. "I cannot hope to have just the place&#xD;
in the world that I should like best."&#xD;
There was some wistfulness, some sorrowful feeling, in&#xD;
her eyes for a moment; and then she said,&#xD;
"I will hope it ! and if not-it will be better for you,-&#xD;
that is enough."&#xD;
But we all felt very much drawn together that night.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXI.&#xD;
I do not envy thee, Pamela; only I wish that being thy sister in nature, Itwere&#xD;
not so far off akin in fortune.-SIDNEY.&#xD;
THREE months passed by, and how did we stand then ?-&#xD;
if standing it might be called. Another piece of plate&#xD;
had followed the tea-set, and another debt had been paid off.&#xD;
Our last city property we had let go, with all the money&#xD;
paid on it, for just the comfort of untieing a weight from&#xD;
our necks. The mill worked not, because some needful&#xD;
machinery we could not buy ; so the rest of the works rusted&#xD;
like the money that had been spent on them, and the stream&#xD;
babbled of our folly, for want of other employment. A&#xD;
little more or a little less, and we had been richer. Our&#xD;
cattle were'diminished in size and numbers; our fruit-walls&#xD;
done but wanting a gardener to make them productive ;&#xD;
while the stone cottages stood unroofed for the following&#xD;
reason. Mr. McLoon had begun to add his unnecessary&#xD;
aid to the discomposing of-our affairs: had declared that&#xD;
our selling out cottage lots would be an injury to him, and&#xD;
that he would not give title. JIe had promised the contrary&#xD;
--but it was not on paper, and he was not fully paid,-so&#xD;
we went to law again.&#xD;
Then came a judgment for the schooling of some poor&#xD;
boy whom my father had tried to educate-a friend took&#xD;
,that off our hands. Then another for cattle feed---but that&#xD;
too was settled.&#xD;
Then Mr. Howard decided that he ought not to let Ezra&#xD;
Barrington work for nothing--(which Ezra seemed inclined&#xD;
to do), and that he could not afford to pay him proper&#xD;
wages.. So we began to live along with "help" the were&#xD;
no help. Sometimes it was an Irishman who got offended,&#xD;
&#xD;
<pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC8204-00000097"/>&#xD;
or a&amp;amp;Scotchman who got drunk; or some other specimen of&#xD;
humanity who was light..fingered. Honesty, in all its senses,&#xD;
was never heard of; the best man we had would just&#xD;
work while we looked at him. When my father left home&#xD;
idleness was the order of the day: and we poor women saw&#xD;
it with helpless discomfort. I say we-I was not a woman,&#xD;
hardly was Kate that in years; but sympathy and circum-&#xD;
stances did the work of Time,-mowing down spring flow-&#xD;
ers and ripening the grain.&#xD;
" I shall not keep any servant this summer," said Mrs.&#xD;
Howard, when she had apparently resolved herself into a&#xD;
committee of ways and means, and had sat thinking long&#xD;
and silently.&#xD;
"Not keep any servant mamma! why we want another&#xD;
this minute."&#xD;
"Did you ever read Miss Taylor's ' I can do without it' '&#xD;
she answered with a smile.&#xD;
"That's all well enough mamma when you're talking of&#xD;
inkstands and bonnets, but servants are another affair."&#xD;
"-We will try how the rule will bear stretching," said&#xD;
Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
"It won't bear it mamma-you needn't think it; and&#xD;
you're not able-you are doing too much now." And Kate&#xD;
laid down her work and looked up earnestly.&#xD;
" We had much better save in some other way, mamma."&#xD;
"What other ?' I can think of none Katie.. No we will&#xD;
try this; it is much pleasanter than owing money that we&#xD;
cannot pay. Ezra Barrington is to live at the Lea you.&#xD;
lkiow, and his wife will come and wash, or do anything else&#xD;
that is needful."&#xD;
"But how"-said Kate, and she stopped.&#xD;
"How it will look?  Yes it will look a little odd, and&#xD;
people will think less of us, but after all our own self-&#xD;
respect is of more importance."&#xD;
"Mamma," said Kate, "what do you think of giving up&#xD;
sugar'? we could do without that, and it would save some-&#xD;
thing."&#xD;
My stepmother looked wistfully at the young proposer&#xD;
of such retrenchments.&#xD;
" It wouldn't save a great deal, dear Kate," she answered&#xD;
.--" however, I am willing, but don't tell your father."&#xD;

So we drank our tea unsweetened, and felt that we were&#xD;
doing something.&#xD;
Nobody knew all this, and few suspected the half of it,&#xD;
for we still kept up a cheerful appearance. Miss Easy&#xD;
seemed quite taken aback by our asking if she knew of a&#xD;
place for Caddie.&#xD;
"Why dear me !" she said, "yes ma'am, I thought you&#xD;
liked her so much."&#xD;
"I do likeher," said Mrs. Howard smiling, "but I don't&#xD;
want her."&#xD;
Miss Easy looked perplexed.&#xD;
"I am going to try how we can do without servants."&#xD;
"Without any servants ?" said Miss Easy.&#xD;
"Yes," said my stepmother smiling, "I want to econo-&#xD;
mize a little-I think we ought to do all we can for our-&#xD;
selves."&#xD;
"Yes ma'am, to be sure-dear Mrs. Howard I feel as if&#xD;
I must do all that I can : but you cannot do more than that,&#xD;
-you cannot indeed."&#xD;
"Ah but you don't know us yet, Miss Easy," I said;&#xD;
"we can do-a great deal when we set about it."&#xD;
"Dear Gracie, yes, I do know," said Miss Easy-" I am&#xD;
sure you can do a great deal, yes. But Mrs. Howard is&#xD;
this really necessary.? it seems to me, yes ma'am, that&#xD;
you're doing too much now. And you don't know what it&#xD;
is to be without anybody-I shouldn't think you could bear&#xD;
it. It's well- enough for strong country women that are&#xD;
used to it, but you--and these girls-"&#xD;
Mrs. Howard looked at us half in sorrow half in hesit-&#xD;
tion.&#xD;
"I do know it all Miss Easy-all that you might say,&#xD;
all that others will say, and still I think I am right. .You&#xD;
know unless we can save money though to finish some of&#xD;
our beginnings they will never be profitable. And it's&#xD;
only for a time,-.-.just now Mr'Howard is so harassed and&#xD;
engrossed with one thing and another, that I would try&#xD;
almost any means of relief; but in a few months all diffi-&#xD;
culty may be over, and in the mean time a little more&#xD;
exercise will not hurt us."&#xD;
"No," said Miss Easy, "not while you can all smile&#xD;
i'pon it so,* lut I think I can find Caddie a place-ges&#xD;

'"v&#xD;

&#xD;
ma'arn, I will take her myself, and then you can have her&#xD;
back again any minute."&#xD;
"Is that why you want to take her Miss Easy ?" said&#xD;
Kate laughing.&#xD;
"No," she said with a smile-"not all the why,-I&#xD;
really want her on my own account."&#xD;
"I intend to send Grace away till we get these matters&#xD;
arranged," said Mrs. Howard; "she is going to pay Ste-&#xD;
phanie a visit."&#xD;
"'Are you indeed !" said Miss Easy,-" well I am glad,&#xD;
and sorry too-yes very. .I think it will do her good.&#xD;
But dear Gracie how we shall miss you."&#xD;
"I like to be missed ma'am, as Mr. Rodney says."&#xD;
" Have you heard from him lately ?" said Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
"No ma'am, not very lately. You know that his bro-&#xD;
ther is here ?"&#xD;
"Not absolutely come?"&#xD;
"Yes indeed he is, and his wife too. I saw them yester-&#xD;
day."&#xD;
"And I must see them to-morrow !"&#xD;
"What kind of a person is his wife, Miss Easy?" said&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
"Not like you dear," said Miss Caffery with an affee-&#xD;
tionate smile, "nor like Grace-no not one bit. I don't&#xD;
exactly know what she is like-very different from any-&#xD;
thing I ever found at the Lea before," she added sighing.&#xD;
"It quite made me sad to go there again, yes. But Ava.&#xD;
rintha liked her very much-thought her beautiful, yes&#xD;
ma'am, and so polished. I don't know," said Miss Easy--&#xD;
"yes-I believe it's a kind of polish that makes my eyes&#xD;
ache, and my heart too."&#xD;
"Mamma," said Kate, "if she is such a sort of person&#xD;
it is not worth our while to call upon her-she would not&#xD;
care to see us. And then you know-"&#xD;
"What do I know?" '&#xD;
"You know if we are to have no servants we could not&#xD;
ask her here," said Kate colouring a little.&#xD;
"I should have paid but few visits in my life," said Mrs.&#xD;
Howard, "if I had waited to feel sure of my welcome;&#xD;
and even it your last position be unapproachable, 1atie,&#xD;
we may at least do what we can."              .    .&#xD;
&#xD;
"Quite right," said Miss Easy, "and you will think so&#xD;
too, one of these days. One never regrets doing a polite&#xD;
or a kind thing, no matter how it is received."&#xD;
"If this were either-" said Kate. "Now Miss Easy&#xD;
what are you smiling at ?"&#xD;
"1To see how little you know what is andwhat isn't, I&#xD;
should think," said Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
"Something like that," said Miss Easy,-"yes Katie, it&#xD;
is both polite and kind-to the family."&#xD;
And there was no more to be said ; though as Kate&#xD;
remarked, "her forgetfulness had been very natural,-she&#xD;
had but looked at Mr, Carvill where he had put himself;&#xD;
and that was, out of his family."&#xD;
The next day we set forth to pay our respects to the&#xD;
new comers. I certainly had none to pay, but the rest did&#xD;
not want to leave me, and I did not want to be left-two&#xD;
very obvious reasons for going.&#xD;
What is there in some exquisitely fine weather to make&#xD;
one feel sad ? It was one of those days of which March&#xD;
has a few, that seem to embody the very quintessence of&#xD;
spring,-the sky of the fairest and calmest, the grass in&#xD;
the yellow-green transition, the trees softened with the&#xD;
swelling buds as with the lightest veil of clothing, and&#xD;
showing green or red as flowers or leaves were to come&#xD;
first. In sheltered fence-corners or bank-protected hollows,&#xD;
there were tufts of grass that-might have come from the&#xD;
emerald isle itself; now and then a tuft of tiny white flow-&#xD;
ers-quiet, insignificant little things-that the eye sought&#xD;
and rested upon because it was March and not June. And&#xD;
even one or two bright-faced dandelions, that had been&#xD;
waked up by some extraordinary sunbeam, looked at us&#xD;
smilingly from the wayside. The birds were in a twitter of&#xD;
delight and consultation,-robins ind song-sparrows excited&#xD;
each other; and the phoebe's gentle note of reproof, and the&#xD;
crow's loud "caw" of disdain as he sat on a cedar and&#xD;
bowed his head mockingly, neither calmed the spirits nor&#xD;
roused the ire, of the warblers,-their dignity was safe&#xD;
bound up in enthousiasm. On one bush sat a committee of&#xD;
fifty robins,-in another, where two sparrows made mys-&#xD;
y serious darts through the evergreen foliage, there might be&#xD;
the nucleus of a nest. The scarce stirring air was as sofb&#xD;

&#xD;
and delicious as if it had been laid up all winter in sachets&#xD;
of satin and sweetness ;-but bouquet nor patchouli can ap-&#xD;
proach the unspeakable aroma of early flowers and leaves&#xD;
-that indefinable perfume that spring compounds for itself.&#xD;
And yet as we breathed it in-and breaths seemed all too&#xD;
short in such an atmosphere-the exceeding~ beauty of&#xD;
everything brought no exhilaration, but rather sadness. It&#xD;
might be the association with other spring days when our&#xD;
hearts were lighter-a mind somewhat out of tone with&#xD;
the season,-it might be that the beauty was too perfect.&#xD;
Perfection of any kind is too near the contrast.&#xD;
So we walked musingly to the Lea house, and there in-&#xD;
stead of Mrs. Crown and her pleasant white apron we were&#xD;
met by a man in an embroidered cap, which the weight of&#xD;
responsibility, or its long tassel, had drawn very much to,&#xD;
one side. Following this gentleman's flourish of head and&#xD;
hand and foot, we were ushered into the room that had&#xD;
been Mr. Rodney's study, and where we had taken off our&#xD;
cloaks on that first Christmas.&#xD;
No study now.-A guitar in one corner, a flute and cas-&#xD;
tanets on the table ; a cabinet that seemed to contain more&#xD;
gilding and morocco than letter-press; a large worsted&#xD;
frame with a St. Cecilia who had as yet but one eye and half&#xD;
a nose ; a French clock from which the dial-plate looked&#xD;
forth timidly, as doubting its right to be there; and a pis-&#xD;
tol, izaak Walton and Dumas at hand for light literature.&#xD;
On a stand near the window sat a beautiful scarlet&#xD;
Lorius, who with his yellow breast-collar, orange bilk, and&#xD;
the mingling of green, purple, and violet-blue upon his&#xD;
head and wings looked almost like some gay piece of patch-&#xD;
work.&#xD;
Mrs. Carvill Collingwood-or to carry out my father's&#xD;
"good riddance," Mrs. Carvill-sat reading in a luxurious&#xD;
easy-chair. No one could have mistaken her for anything&#xD;
but French. A face that Aould have been handsome but&#xD;
for its haughtiness, was displayed to the uttermost,-not&#xD;
only was a strip of hair turned quite back, but the large&#xD;
black bandeaux had also a retrograde twist, giving full&#xD;
effect to the ear as well as the eye sparklers. A rather&#xD;
pale complexion, and a mouth that might have been educa-&#xD;
ted to sweetness, were kept. in order by a somnewht 'dis-&#xD;

dainful and self-satisfied little nose. She was dressed in a&#xD;
light summer silk, the skirt of which -opening at the waist&#xD;
and stretching away over an embroidered petticoat, spread&#xD;
its soft folds upon the floor for the nestling place of a little&#xD;
King Charles. His gentle, lustrous eyes looked up at us as&#xD;
we entered, but the long ears still lay silkily over the shaggy&#xD;
feet; till his mistress drawing in her own satin slippers,&#xD;
roused him with a somewhat impatient "otez-vous !" and&#xD;
came forward to meet us.&#xD;
It was a doubtful coming forward, too; and the book&#xD;
was still held with one finger for a mark, as if she trusted&#xD;
the interruption would be short. My'stepmother's manner&#xD;
was, however, hard to withstand; and Mrs. Carvill relaxed&#xD;
into at least conventional pleasure at our visit, and listened&#xD;
to all that was said with some attempt at interest.&#xD;
. I have heard Mr. Rod-e-ney speak of you," she said&#xD;
with that deliberate accentuation which the voluble French&#xD;
sometimes give to our mother tongue, and perhaps meaning&#xD;
to explain the long stare with which Kate and I had been&#xD;
honoured.&#xD;
"sQui vive ' cried the Lorius,-- gare ! gare! vive les&#xD;
sans-culottes !"&#xD;
" Chut !" cried his mistress impatiently. "It isnot me&#xD;
Madame Howard, who teach him such remark-je ne suis&#xD;
point revolutioniste-it is Mr. Carvill."&#xD;
"Adieu perfide ! adieu volage !" sang the bird. "Pain!&#xD;
pain! a   rsails a Versailles !-Vive le roi s'il est de&#xD;
bon. foi ! II y a long temps que je l'aimait.' Plut~t' la&#xD;
mort que l'esclavage! Ah 9a ira ! ah uatra !   Ia belle&#xD;
France !"&#xD;
Mrs. Carvill's displeasure softened at these last words,&#xD;
which she had doubtless taught the bird herself, and which&#xD;
he pronounced so pathetically that we were all touched ;&#xD;
and with no further reproof than a muttered "si bete !" she&#xD;
turned to us again, for the Lorius had seemingly had his&#xD;
say. Stretching out one leg and wing to their utmost ex&#xD;
tent, he shut up. his eyes, gaped, and was mute.&#xD;
"You live here always?" said Mrs. Carvill to Kate.&#xD;
"No-only for the' last three years."&#xD;
"And you never go away-never go anywhere ?"&#xD;

"But what you do? there is not no society in this place."&#xD;
" Liberty ! egalit6 ! fraternity !" cried the Lorius. ."Qui&#xD;
vive ? a bas les aristocrats !"&#xD;
" Cela passe !". said the lady jumping up and opening a&#xD;
door,-&#xD;
" Atanaise ! otez cet oiseau et faite qu'il se taise !&#xD;
Well," she added, coming back to her seat, "it cannot be&#xD;
that you like these person about here-in what you call&#xD;
the neighbourhood?"&#xD;
"Some of them I like very much," said Kate.&#xD;
"You do not know them yet, Mrs. Carvill," said my&#xD;
stepmother.&#xD;
"C'est ce que je ne ferai jamais !" said she with a shrug&#xD;
of the shoulders ; and with this' hopeful remark we "tum-&#xD;
bled into a well," as Dickens has it. The little King Charles&#xD;
had jumped into his mistress's lap, and lay stretched upon&#xD;
the worked petticoat; while Mrs. Carvill passed his long&#xD;
ears through her dainty fingers, and called him "mignon"&#xD;
and "petit aimant" and "mon beau Chevalier"; and the&#xD;
dog just moved his little fringed tail by way of answer.&#xD;
"You know Mr. Rod-e-ney much ?" said Mrs. Carvill.&#xD;
"Yes, we have seen a good deal of him.".&#xD;
"And you like him?"&#xD;
" Oh yes !" said we all.&#xD;
Again we were treated to a comprehensive stare; and&#xD;
finding the well rather too deep to be pleasant, we were&#xD;
about to come away, when the master of the house en-&#xD;
tered.&#xD;
He was a good specimen of strong family likeness com-&#xD;
bined with a great want of it,-the resemblance in feature&#xD;
and voice being almost nullified by. the difference in&#xD;
character; which gave a gay, heartless, matter of course&#xD;
expression, to what in his father and brother had been grave,&#xD;
kind, and full of meaning. He looked good-natured, too-&#xD;
and rather prepossessing, but neither straightforward nor&#xD;
reliable. Salutations so demure that they almost made us&#xD;
laugh, a very quick, keen survey through a veil of careless-&#xD;
ness, and Mr. Carvill sat down with a look that said his&#xD;
mind was made up-about something.&#xD;
"     _Well .ma'am," he said, "I am glad you have come to&#xD;
prove the truth of my assertion that we should have some&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLLARS AND'GETS.              199&#xD;
neighbours down here. Upon my word! I havn't seen-&#xD;
pray Mr. Howard are your daughters a fair representation&#xD;
of the county ?"&#xD;
"Really sir," said my father, who had hardly spoken&#xD;
hitherto, "I doubt whether the county would choose them&#xD;
to that office."&#xD;
"It ought to, I'm certain of it--Miss Howard is colour-&#xD;
ing with displeasure that I should even have asked the&#xD;
question. Clemence, where's Louis Quatorze?"&#xD;
" In the other room."&#xD;
" Why isn't he here ?"&#xD;
"I did not want him--he make .too much noise, Mr.&#xD;
Carvill."&#xD;
" What-has he been talking politics? ha, ha, he shall&#xD;
have a bit of cake for that."&#xD;
"For to have disturbed me ?" said the lady raising her&#xD;
eyebrows.&#xD;
"No my dear, for pleasing me."&#xD;
"When did you see your brother, Mr Carvill ?" said my&#xD;
father.&#xD;
"Who, Rodney? I declare .1 don't know sir,-of course&#xD;
I saw him the minute I landed, but since then-l think it&#xD;
was two weeks ago-an interview with him always stands&#xD;
out in such bold relief, that it's hard to locate it precisely."&#xD;
"He was well?"&#xD;
"Well? yes I hope so,-rather pale too, now I think of&#xD;
it. Not alarmingly so, ladies-only enough to be interest-&#xD;
ing,-fatigued perhaps-he's going to be the greatest&#xD;
savant of the age I suppose, so we have a chance of one&#xD;
star in the family.&#xD;
"Only a chance ?" said my father smiling.&#xD;
"Why," said Mr. Carvill answering him but looking&#xD;
quietly at us, " I suppose you know best-I have seen so&#xD;
little of the gentleman since he was a boy, and then you&#xD;
know,-im the moral firmament of course, but. I was speak-&#xD;
ing of the niental. Can't tell what sort of a star it will be,&#xD;
neither,--Rodpey looked prodigiously grave, but upon my&#xD;
soul I couldn't tell whether it was philosophy or mathe-&#xD;
matics."&#xD;
"I daresay not," said my father dryly--."I think it&#xD;
would puzzle any onie to settle the question."&#xD;

"Miss Howard," said Mr. Carvill rightly' interpreting&#xD;
the slight compression of Kate's under lip, "is the honour&#xD;
of amusing you due to Rodney or to me ?"&#xD;
My father saved her reply.&#xD;
" How do you like this country life, Mr. Carvill ?" he&#xD;
said; "it must be a novelty atsleast."&#xD;
"Yes sir, and that's a charm it shall never lose. -It was&#xD;
a dull season in town and so I just came here to see what&#xD;
wanted doing for September. You don't suppose I'm keep-&#xD;
ing this place for anything but a shooting lodge Mr. How-&#xD;
ard 2"&#xD;
" I did hope so," said my father.&#xD;
"My dear sir ! a man of your sense and experience to&#xD;
imagine such a thing ! Live here ? why I'd pocket the&#xD;
whole concern in five minutes, if I didn't want to bag the&#xD;
birds separately."&#xD;
" As to sense and experience, Mr. Carvill," said my&#xD;
father, "men with more than I pretend to have not only&#xD;
imagined such a thing possible, but have actually done&#xD;
it."&#xD;
"O you mean my father," said the young man; and for&#xD;
a moment there was a shade upon his face that quite came&#xD;
in aid of the family likeness,-then shaking it off he said&#xD;
gaily,&#xD;
"All right in the abstract sir-I can comprehend how&#xD;
Rodney thinks you such paragons-but you are wrong as&#xD;
regards me, I assure you,-I never was meant to live at&#xD;
Daisy Lea. In the first place 1 have some little regard for&#xD;
my wife's liking and a most tender one for my own. Now&#xD;
I do suppose that brother ofmine could establish himself,&#xD;
here, and probably," said M"r 'arvill speaking slow and as&#xD;
if he were contemplating possibilities, "probably he might&#xD;
find all the society.he would care about. But as for me-&#xD;
well, I couldn't exist-that's enough. I shouldn't have&#xD;
lived through these five days but for my precious Lorius,&#xD;
whom my wife has consigned to temporary banishment&#xD;
because he's a little too much of a republican."&#xD;
"I am afraid our neighbours would share that fault with&#xD;
him," said my father-" perhaps some of them may have&#xD;
a trifle more education."&#xD;
"Everything in proportion you know sir," said Mr. Car-&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLLARS AND CENTS.              201&#xD;
vill. "Don't despise the neighbourhood at all--leave that&#xD;
to my wife-like it very much-Squire Suydam especially,&#xD;
fine old gentleman enough,--but as to living here! bless&#xD;
me, I'd shoot myself first-would indeed, as gladly, as I'd&#xD;
shoot a woodcock."&#xD;
"I have just been wondering," said Kate, "whether you&#xD;
kill the woodcock for the same reason that you say you&#xD;
would kill yourself-if you .were condemned to their&#xD;
habitat."&#xD;
"Hardly worth while to let 'em live when it takes so&#xD;
little to put 'em out of their misery," said Mr. Carvill.&#xD;
"You don't mean to say that you like this place Miss&#xD;
Howard 2"&#xD;
"No sir, I don't mean to say anything about it," replied&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
"Incroyable !" muttered our host. "I suppose you, Mr.&#xD;
Howard, get along by means of your daughters, but how&#xD;
on earth. they support life, is more than I can under-&#xD;
stand."&#xD;
"You need riot try," said Mrs. Cargill whose cold eye&#xD;
had watched the laugh with which Kate and I indulged our-&#xD;
selves, "it is none of your affair."&#xD;
" Don't look dismal either," pursued her husban,--..&#xD;
"well it's a comfort to one's philanthropy to know that&#xD;
handsome young ladies can exist and be happy anywhere.&#xD;
I always thought the line about 'full many a flower,' was a&#xD;
poetical fiction,--but the man must have'had second sight&#xD;
--and have drawn from the Miss Howards."&#xD;
"It would be hard to prove that anything is wasted sir,&#xD;
merely because God has pit  in one 'place instead of&#xD;
another," said my father gravely. And with that We took&#xD;
leave, and released Mrs. Careill's4forefinger.&#xD;
"Let us go home by the lake," said my father; and&#xD;
quitting thefield road for a littlepath that yet was h&#xD;
a path, we skirted the bright water, which sent one i&#xD;
another of its tiny waves almost to our very feet 'to greet&#xD;
us. We sat down and watched them as they came up,&#xD;
each sparkling and swelling with importance, then 'making&#xD;
its low obeisance, and with a soft word of welcome retiring&#xD;
.again behind its fellows.&#xD;
"Kate," said my father suddenly, "it matter 'very little&#xD;

to Farmer Collingwood now, that the waves of health and&#xD;
riches rolled from instead of towards him."&#xD;
She looked inquiringly but said nothing.,&#xD;
"Don't you think so daughterI is he any the less&#xD;
happy?"&#xD;
"No indeed papa-the happier, if contrast has any&#xD;
power out of this world."&#xD;
" And may we not suppose that he looks back upon all&#xD;
the circumstances of his life as the best possible, for him?&#xD;
that his 'day and night and summer and winter' (they must&#xD;
succeed each other, Kate) were of just the right temper-&#xD;
ature and proportion ?"&#xD;
"Yes, of course, papa.* But why do you ask me?"&#xD;
"Merely because 'if these things are so' we may as well&#xD;
take the comfort of them. There is no latitude on this&#xD;
earth my dear, where the sun shines unceasingly, but neither&#xD;
is there any where he never comes: and it is well to re-&#xD;
member that 'the sailing of a cloud hath Providence to&#xD;
its pilot.'"&#xD;
"But papa you do not answer' my question-I do not&#xD;
quite understand you."&#xD;
"I thought," said my father with a look of more sym-&#xD;
pathy than reproof, "I thought Katie, that you both came&#xD;
from the Lea feeling a little sober,--I was afraid the power&#xD;
of contrast had been too strong."&#xD;
"I believe it had some effect, papa," said Kate, her eyes&#xD;
filling as she spoke,-" I would not change place with the&#xD;
Carvills for anything in the world, and yet there seems to&#xD;
be a great deal of comfort in the abundance of means--&#xD;
the perfect freedom from all embarrassments."&#xD;
" I have thought so very often," said my father.&#xD;
"And never to hear of a judge or a lawsuit--" said I.&#xD;
" Dear Gracie," said Kate, "don't think of them now,-&#xD;
I am too glad to have you go away for a while beyond their&#xD;
reach."&#xD;
"Come," said Mr. Howard getting off his stone,&#xD;
"haven't you sat here long enough? : I believe if I am to&#xD;
take the benefit of my own lessons," he added, "we had&#xD;
better not pursue, the subject."&#xD;

CHAPTER RXXII.&#xD;
I can get no remedy against this consumption of the purse.&#xD;
Borrowing only lingers and lingers it outs but the disease is incurable.&#xD;
SHAISPCARE.-&#xD;
"T ON'T think about them"-how easy to say, how hard&#xD;
1 to practise, when annoyances are in question ! For-&#xD;
mer ones we could in a measure forget ; but those new&#xD;
perplexities that ever sprang up by our wayside-could we&#xD;
pass them by without notice ? Sometimes-rand sometimes&#xD;
we took them up and bare them along with us.&#xD;
"I do not want to go, in the .least," said I when the&#xD;
preparations for my visit were near an end.&#xD;
"Kate is going to spend one day in Philadelphia with&#xD;
you," said my stepmother,-" you 'will like to go in her&#xD;
company ?"&#xD;
" But I wish she would stay longer-why should she go&#xD;
for one day ?"&#xD;
"It will do her good, and we want sundry things that&#xD;
your father will have no time to get,-if he attends that&#xD;
meeting of the     Society."&#xD;
"Mnamma," said Kate, "was it for that he said his coat&#xD;
was not fit ?"&#xD;
"He wants a new one at all events," said Mrs. Howard&#xD;
" and I'm sure-I'm sure I don't know how he's to get .:&#xD;
just now."       ,&#xD;
"I'll tell you mamma, let's sell our old cake-basket."&#xD;
"O Kate !" said I, "you don't mean the one grandma&#xD;
gave us?"&#xD;
"That is the only one that belongs to you and me,&#xD;
Gracie."&#xD;
"But would you sell it 1"&#xD;

"We have another, you know," said Kate, "and the old&#xD;
one is not a good shape."&#xD;
"I know-but I love it so much !"&#xD;
"But papa wants this coat."&#xD;
"Well--" said I sighing.&#xD;
"What do you say, mamma?"&#xD;
"I should say yes, my dear, if it were mine-you must&#xD;
do nothing that will trouble your sister."&#xD;
O you must not mind me."&#xD;
"But see," said Kate, "perhaps papa will be able to&#xD;
give us the money again before long, and then we can re-&#xD;
deem our fruit-knives,--wouldn't you like that as well ?"&#xD;
"No-you know I have a great fancy for old things; but&#xD;
let us sell it--papa must have the coat."&#xD;
So it was settled ; and when I went to Philadelphia,&#xD;
Kate and the basket went too, and from the trunk it was&#xD;
speedily transferred to the jeweller's counter.&#xD;
Many a time one wants sympathy when it cannot rea-&#xD;
sonably be looked for, yet does not the want seem lighter.&#xD;
I know that it was with a feeling almost of impatience that&#xD;
I watched Mr. Jewett, as he turned the cake-basket about,&#xD;
eyed it with some curiosity and some little compassion for&#xD;
the "dark ages" of his craft, and finally remarked, (what&#xD;
business had he to remind me of it?)&#xD;
"A piece of old family silver, I should judge sir,-we&#xD;
don't often see such things now-a-days."&#xD;
Then came question and answer, and it was 'worth so&#xD;
much in ready money, and so much in other articles of plate ;&#xD;
and the matter ended we left the shop both richer and&#xD;
poorer than we had' entered it. The coat took but a part&#xD;
of the money, and for the' rest wt debated between our&#xD;
fruit-knives and some other things that had long been want-&#xD;
ing, but prudence prevailed over inclination.&#xD;
I know. not what became of 'the cake-basket-perhaps it&#xD;
does duty as silver skewers at the table of some millionaire&#xD;
who never heard of scarcity or sacrifice. The coat is long&#xD;
since worn out--the "other things" have disappeared, but&#xD;
the fruit-knives have not been heard of; and Kate and I&#xD;
sometimes. say to each other, " our poor basket !-it is&#xD;
almost a pity we sold it;adythtcolppaav&#xD;
done without that coat  , n  e   htcol"aahv&#xD;

206            DOLLARS AND CENTS.&#xD;
Once more we resorted to such an expedient, and then&#xD;
learned the wise lesson that expedients of all sorts are but&#xD;
poor things-a&amp;amp; barter of the reality for the seeming ; not&#xD;
only failing to remedy the evil, but weakening the energy&#xD;
which alone can.&#xD;
Once more, as I said, we tried it,-while the ready money&#xD;
from the first attempt yet dwelt in our minds and tempted&#xD;
us;-the proposed articles of exchange were brought down&#xD;
by Mr. Howard when he came for me.&#xD;
It was a selection from our small stock of trinkets, and&#xD;
touched me far more nearly than the cake-basket. I cared&#xD;
little for the things in themselves-in fact they were most&#xD;
of them either worn out, or such as we should never use ;&#xD;
but if dimmed and broken, so were not my associations&#xD;
with them. The hands that had touched them, the faces&#xD;
they had touched, I had heard of at least; and these poor&#xD;
little reminders of what had long ago perished, seemed to&#xD;
help both imagination and memory. It signified little that&#xD;
my mother's old watch could not be made to go-it had&#xD;
kept time once, and for her, and the grasp of strange fin-&#xD;
gers seemed almost sacrilegious. Mr. Jewett skewed no-&#xD;
curiosity this time, but his look was methought a little&#xD;
scornful as he tumbled the things about, and then declared&#xD;
he could not say what they were worth, till he had, separa-&#xD;
ted and weighed the gold. Even then would I have res-&#xD;
cued them had the money been for me ! I had enough of&#xD;
expedients.&#xD;
And what did we live on all this while ?--partly on drib-&#xD;
lets of former debts and property, partly,on new trifles-a&#xD;
little rent here and a little business there,-not on very&#xD;
much of anything. But Mrs. Howard was an excellent&#xD;
manager in any circumstances, and our neighbours thought&#xD;
our style of living both comfortable and pretty. So it was,&#xD;
had we reached it, by some other road; but the enjoyment&#xD;
of many a thing was shadowed by the preliminary "ought-&#xD;
we ?" or " can we have it?--"                   .2&#xD;
I realized it all the more, when after spending some time&#xD;
with Stephanie in a happy forgetfulness of money and .its&#xD;
long train of difficulties and doubts, I came back to Glen&#xD;
Luna. Nothing had changed for the worse, but my mind -&#xD;
once set free, loathed to take up again the old burden of&#xD;

dollars and cents. Neither is there much truth in that fa-&#xD;
vourite maxim with some ladies, that "servants are the&#xD;
greatest plagues in the universe"-a house with no servants&#xD;
is more to be deprecated. However we managed pretty&#xD;
well, for Mrs. Barrington was only too glad to do anything&#xD;
for us, and her daughter Prudence (become 'Dency by a&#xD;
little contraction and elongation) was always ready when&#xD;
wanted. Indeed if for nothing else, they liked to come and&#xD;
tell of the queer doings at Daisy Lea.&#xD;
"Don't it beat all !" 'Dency would say. "Why Mis'&#xD;
Howard, they've sent down the dreadfullest sight of dogs!&#xD;
-and a man that ain't got nothin' to do but mind 'em;&#xD;
and he says when they begin to hunt he feeds 'em on raw&#xD;
meat to make 'em more savager."&#xD;
I may notice in passing, that during my absence Mr. and&#xD;
Mrs. Carvill had left the Lea, and without returning our&#xD;
visit.&#xD;
"You may as well tell her at once mamma," said Kate&#xD;
the dray after I got home.&#xD;
"Tell me what ?"&#xD;
"Poor child !" said my stepmother kissing me, she&#xD;
don't look as if'she could bear much. Why Gracie, have&#xD;
you worn sucha face ever since you went away?"&#xD;
"I don't know mamma-I suppose I am tired low: but&#xD;
tell me what?"&#xD;
"Did you ever hear your father talk of his being surety&#xD;
with a Mr. Van Wart for somebody V"&#xD;
"I believe I have."&#xD;
"Well things have gone so that the sureties are called&#xD;
upon to pay; and Van Wart's son-in-law Jenkinson, has&#xD;
contrived to have the creditors come down upon your&#xD;
father for the'whole amount."&#xD;
"But he can't pay it?"&#xD;
"Certainly not; and they have entered up a judgment,&#xD;
and while' you were gone a sheriff came here with an ex-&#xD;
oution upon all our furniture."&#xD;
"Is that all ?" said I withalong breath, and really feel-&#xD;
ing relieved, for the time.&#xD;

"But they didn't take them," said I casting a somewhat&#xD;
blank look round the room.&#xD;
"0 no," said Mrs. Howard, "and I hope they will not.&#xD;
But your father was away, and this man Jenkinson came&#xD;
with the sheriff and knocked at the door, and Kate let them&#xD;
in; for we didn't knovy that we could do otherwise. Your&#xD;
father says we had a right to keep even the sheriff out, and&#xD;
that Jenkinson had no business to come at all."&#xD;
"And only think !" said Kate, "he had put on green&#xD;
spectacles that mamma might not recognise him! And&#xD;
fhey went all over the house making a list of everything--&#xD;
silver and all, and I had to go with them. And now they&#xD;
have advertised the things to be sold some day next&#xD;
month."&#xD;
" And will papa let them'?"&#xD;
"Not if he can helpit-I don't quite understand what&#xD;
he means to do-get an injunction I believe, whatever that&#xD;
is, till the matter can be tried."&#xD;
The injunction was obtained; but though a stay of pro.-&#xD;
ceedings was in one way a comfort, yet we found the sus-&#xD;
pense very trying. And the courts were dilatory, as courts&#xD;
always are, and months wore on; and still we looked doubt,&#xD;
fully at our indoor possessions, and wondered how long we&#xD;
should keep each other company. Whether all this was made&#xD;
public we could not tell; but as no one ever spoke to us of&#xD;
it, the contrary seemed most probable. From Miss Easy we&#xD;
carefully hid all our troubles, for she had been and was still&#xD;
unwell ; and though she would sometimes look earnestly&#xD;
at Kate and me as we sat by her sofa, and sometimes sigh&#xD;
to herself as if she saw or imagined too much gravity in&#xD;
our faces ; we generally contrived to be so very bright&#xD;
during the rest of the visit, that she at least did not question&#xD;
us. Miss Bain would certainly have found out all and more&#xD;
than all that was known of our affairs, had she been at&#xD;
home ;--but while I was away, she had gone to visit some&#xD;
fourteenth cousin who was as far off in geography as in&#xD;
blood.&#xD;
And with these sayings and doings we came-to the last&#xD;
week in August.&#xD;

mother said I'd best put right off and tell ye, for likely&#xD;
you'd want to hear."&#xD;
" Thank you 'Dency," said Kate, "but what is the news?&#xD;
I did not understand."&#xD;
"Mr. and Mrs. Carvill Miss Kate--they all come to the&#xD;
Lea last night, and forty 'leven servants ! And father&#xD;
went up he did, to see was there anything wanting, and if&#xD;
they would have some of the new wheat ground; and Mr.&#xD;
Carvill said he didn't know nor he didn't care-father might&#xD;
ask Mrs. Carvill if he felt disposed. Father said he&#xD;
shouldn't do no such a thing,-he says he don't believe Mrs.&#xD;
Carvill knows where wheat comes from. Don't it beat&#xD;
all, Miss Kate ?"&#xD;
" Why it's rather a queer way of doing business&#xD;

"That's just what father says-he says it beats the&#xD;
Dutch, he does. There's the most company come !"&#xD;

says it beats himr to know where they'll all sleep. Ain't&#xD;

really one of the best and kindest of our neighbours.&#xD;
"Yes we are very well," said my stepmother smiling&#xD;
pleasantly; "and how do you do at home?"&#xD;
"My children's all dreadful well'ma'am-they never had&#xD;
such health. My husband he's dreadful well-too, only he's&#xD;
got a little pain into his shoulder,-I tell him he's getting&#xD;
old," said Mrs. Barrington, with a pleased little laugh at&#xD;
the idea of imputing to Ezra anything but the most abso-&#xD;
lute youth and heartiness. "'Taint no particular thanks to&#xD;
anybody, neither, if he is well-if he was some folks he'd&#xD;
be laid up as sure as can be."&#xD;
"Is he more busy than usual?" said Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
"Why he don't hardly get time to eat his victuals&#xD;
ma'am.. To be sure as he says, he always was occupied&#xD;
and always calculated to be, but this beats all. He could&#xD;
see to the farm well enough he says, but when Mr. Car-&#xD;
vill's got to be seen to at one and the same time, he don't&#xD;
rightly know which foot to put foremost, he says. And&#xD;
they can't one on 'em find a bird without he shows&#xD;
'em."&#xD;
"Mr. Carvill is very fond of gunning," said Kate.&#xD;
"But don't it beat all Mrs. Howard that he ain't called&#xD;
Collingwood? he can't be the Farmer's own son, likely."&#xD;
"lie took his uncle's name," said my stepmother:&#xD;
"Do say !" ejaculated Mrs. Barrington--" well of all&#xD;
things! it don't seem nat'ral like for a person to give his&#xD;
child to some one beside. He's a very pretty man too,&#xD;
but it's like nothing else the way they go on up there.&#xD;
And Mrs. Carvill she don't never do a hand's turn, they&#xD;
say ; and the dinner ain't never ready till the chickens is&#xD;
going to bed-dear knows when they go! But they say&#xD;
one of the ladies is the beautifullest singer Miss Kate!.&#xD;
she's got the loudest voice you ever heard."&#xD;
"Has she ?" said Kate smiling.&#xD;
"That's what they tell me; and Ezra says he guesses&#xD;
it's true, for she's always a singin and never leaves off that&#xD;
he can find out. But my ! I think they're all raving crazy&#xD;
there. He goes up most mornings the first thing after.&#xD;
breakfast-that is after their breakfast-and when Mr-.&#xD;
&#xD;
Carvill sees him he says, 'Well, what's to pay now ' he&#xD;
says-' is the cow mad or has one of the sheep got a fit?'&#xD;
Why Miss Kate it's as true as can be."&#xD;
'" I don't doubt it in the least, Mrs. Barrington," said&#xD;
Kate, whose gravity had fairly given way, "but 1 couldn't&#xD;
help laughing."&#xD;
"Well don't it beat all ?" said our informant. "One&#xD;
time be went to see about ploughing the clover meadow,&#xD;
and there was a set of the gentry out on the lawn with&#xD;
Mr. Carvill, so they all kinder gathered round to listen,&#xD;
and Mr. Carvill he said says he, 'O plough it up by all&#xD;
means,' says he, 'but I won't have no winter grain on the&#xD;
farm,' says he-'just plant it with green peas and they'll&#xD;
be all ready for spring,-I'm going to make my fortune&#xD;
raising early vegetables. And Mr. Barrington,' says he,&#xD;
' tell the old grey hen,' says he, 'that if she lays in the&#xD;
wrong nest another day, I'll wring her neck off,' says he.&#xD;
And they all shouted so, you've no idee !-my husband&#xD;
said he was a'most mad."&#xD;
"It is well Mr. Barrington is good-natured," said I&#xD;
laughing.&#xD;
" That's what I say, Miss Grace : I tell him he's the most&#xD;
good-naturedest soul alive, or he couldn't stand it. Why it's&#xD;
just only this morning that Mr. Carvill sent for him up to&#xD;
the house for nothing at all but to say that he didn't be-&#xD;
lieve it was good for the horses to plough afore sunrise ;&#xD;
and then says he,'Mr. Barrington,'says he, 'what do you feed&#xD;
the pigs with ?' says he. So my husband knew there was&#xD;
somethin coming, however he says to him, 'they've had&#xD;
milk all summer, Mr.Carvill,' says he, 'and now they runs in&#xD;
the stubble,' says he. 'That's just it!' says Mr. Carvill.&#xD;
' Well don't let 'em run there any longer,' says he, 'for I'm&#xD;
certain it don't agree with them,-last night the little spot-&#xD;
ted pig did nothing but squeal,' says he. And Ezra said he&#xD;
had to laugh, though he felt real crabbed too."&#xD;
This being the last specimen of Mr. Carvill's eccentricity,&#xD;
Mrs. Barrington felt she had no more to communicate, and&#xD;
therefore took leave; and we sat and smiled at each other&#xD;
in a very amused state of mind.&#xD;

"Not for you dear-I will iron this week, and you and&#xD;
Grace may take holiday. There is but a handful of clothes."&#xD;
"1No indeed-it is our work and you're not to touch it&#xD;
mamma. Please go and sit down and do what you've a&#xD;
mind to-we don't want your help at all. Gracie won't&#xD;
you call Andy to bring some wood, and I'll put the irons&#xD;
down. Now mamma you know we want exercise and you&#xD;
don't."&#xD;
"Well," said Mrs. Howard, "then I will finish mending&#xD;
that shirt-perhaps that is as necessary as anything. I'll&#xD;
tell you what, if your father don't get a piece of cotton the&#xD;
next time he goes away, he will want new shirts very long&#xD;
before we can get them made."&#xD;
So she goes to her work and we to ours.&#xD;
Imagine a long wood fire (we eschewed stoves) upon&#xD;
whose sticks the flame seems to make little impression, as&#xD;
it curls and twines about them; yet it blazes on, no way&#xD;
discouraged, cheered by the bed of red coals beneath. And&#xD;
here, like good soldiers that face the hottest of the fire,&#xD;
stands a row of irons-cool to the eye, but fast losing their&#xD;
original temperament beneath the mighty power of assimi-&#xD;
lation. One table is before the window, and another before&#xD;
the dresser; the clothes-basket between, and the ejethes-&#xD;
horse " beyont," as Caddie would have said. And we make&#xD;
passes at the window and dresser, and take as much trou-&#xD;
ble to smooth a cap and shirt, as if they had been the&#xD;
daily path of their owners. And the basket grows empty&#xD;
and the horse grows full,-and the forestick breaks, and we&#xD;
arrange the fire by turns; and Kate takes der irons from&#xD;
the left end of the row, and I mine from the right. And&#xD;
our faces are a little flushed; and an uncomfortable, soreish&#xD;
feeling in our finger-ends reminds us that hot irons were not&#xD;
always their playthings.  Then enter Purrer-purrer, and&#xD;
jumping on Kate's table she seats herself on a small ped-&#xD;
estal of warm nicely-ironed pocket-handkerchiefs, and winks&#xD;
with satisfaction; and being dislodged with sundry gentle&#xD;
pats, she takes to the clothes-basket, and purrs forth her&#xD;
eulogium of damp sheets. And I set down my iron, and&#xD;
straightening myself exclaim,&#xD;
" 0 Katie! don't your back ache'? and aren't we glad to&#xD;
have cool ironing days once more ?" And she replies,&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLLARS AND CENTS-               213&#xD;
us'"Isn't it very strange that the Carvills never came to see&#xD;
us ?"&#xD;
"Yes, but if they can be so rude they are not worth&#xD;
caring for."&#xD;
"Not worth caring for, to be sure; but still it would be&#xD;
pleasant to be on other terms with them-seeing who they&#xD;
are."&#xD;
And then the irons being too cool, I seat myself upon the&#xD;
corner of n'iy table while Kate occupies a like position upon&#xD;
hers, and gently swinging one foot (for.mere variety's sake)&#xD;
we ook at the fire and make little remarks, till Mrs. How-&#xD;
ard calls from the other room,&#xD;
"Gracie, what if we should have a potatoe-pie for dinner?"&#xD;
"O I should like it very much; but you had better&#xD;
make it Kate-you are tired."&#xD;
"Not more than you are, I guess."&#xD;
"But wouldn't you rather ?-"&#xD;
"Why no child-go off and make it yourself. I'm sure&#xD;
you have ironed more than mI"&#xD;
So  make the pie ; and while it bakes we iron the last&#xD;
few pieces all stamped with the pattern of the basket, and&#xD;
then s  ~  little table even in the neighbourhood of the&#xD;
clothe'  rse: for 'papa is not at home,' and it is 'less&#xD;
trouble han to carry all the things into another room and&#xD;
then bring them back. And after dinner we dress, and&#xD;
Kate sings at her harp "I had ae horse and I had nae&#xD;
mair," and then we walk down to the Bird's Nest,-that is&#xD;
Kate and I, for my stepmother is still busy at the shirts.&#xD;
"XWell," said Miss Easy with her, cheering smile, "and&#xD;
what have you been tiring yourselves with to-day ?"&#xD;
"Not very much with anything ma'am-we have only&#xD;
been using that kind of dumb-bells which are denominated&#xD;
flat-irons."&#xD;
If you would only let me know !" said Miss Easy-'&#xD;
byou could always have Caddie, yes, just as well as not ;&#xD;
butI never can manage to guess the right day. Now why&#xD;
don't you send for her'? yes."&#xD;
"Because it isn't necessary at all," said Kate,-." it don't&#xD;
do us any Iharm."&#xD;
h"-o'' a bit'?" said Miss Easy, who had hold of my&#xD;
hand: ."why this child is trembling now--yes, all over."&#xD;

"INo ma'am, not all over-only my hands, because the&#xD;
irons were a little heavy."&#xD;
"And she will work so hard at it," said Kate.; "she&#xD;
irons up all the clothes away from me."&#xD;
"But it's good for me, Miss Easy," I said-" it's quite&#xD;
good exercise."&#xD;
"Not the best, I fear. However there is no doubt a&#xD;
bright side to it Gracie-yes, if I had not seen you tried I&#xD;
shouldn't know you half so well."&#xD;
"And this is a very gentle trial too," said Kate,-" only&#xD;
a little bit of. real life-enough to keep us from being but-&#xD;
terflies. You don't suppose Miss Easy, that those same&#xD;
winged rovers are half so well acquainted with honey&#xD;
secrets as are the bees 1"'&#xD;
Miss Easy smiled, but shook her head.&#xD;
"It is strange," she replied, "that we cannot always rest&#xD;
satisfied with God's dealings--they are so surely the best&#xD;
that can be! And yet how I have longed to shelter you&#xD;
two-yes, from   every 'touch of .real life,'-how it has&#xD;
grieved me to see where the touch has fallen! Dear chil-&#xD;
dren !-well, there cannot any real harm befall you, and&#xD;
with that I ought to be contented."&#xD;
We were all silent for a few minutes, and then wishing&#xD;
to bring our friend's thoughts from graver subjects, we&#xD;
detailed Mrs. Barrington's information.&#xD;
"Just like him !" said Miss Easy, "never was such an.&#xD;
other wild, random-headed boy as he always has been, yes&#xD;
from a child."&#xD;
Have you known him so long !" said Kate.&#xD;
"Why my dear, yes; I lived here before they came to&#xD;
the Lea-that was just after their mother's death-and&#xD;
Mr. Carvill and Mr. Rodney were quite small then ;--and&#xD;
as they grew older they used to come and get nuts off my&#xD;
great tree, yes, they did indeed. I never liked any so well&#xD;
as those they knocked down for me, and they always got&#xD;
mine before they would help themselves."&#xD;
"And was Mr. Rodney the same. then'?" I asked.&#xD;
"Just the same-yes; always ready to do for everybody&#xD;
--always gentle and affectionate-yes. And don't mean&#xD;
to sa that Mr. Carvill wasn't affectionate too, but he was&#xD;
*  wild and thoughtless, yes very. Yet so long as he staid at&#xD;

K'&#xD;

DOLLARS AND cENTS-          215&#xD;
&#xD;
home he did pretty well, but then you see," continued&#xD;
Miss Easy, "when they went to college Mr. Carvill went&#xD;
all sorts of ways ; and he's never gone straight since."&#xD;
"But how could Farmer Collingwood leave the Lea to&#xD;
him ?" I said.&#xD;
"'He didn't my dear; O no, it was not his-that is, it&#xD;
was his but for life; and then by his uncle's will it was to&#xD;
go to Mr. Carvill."&#xD;
"And that was the uncle Mr. Carvill was named after."&#xD;
"To be sure, yes, and they thought all the world of him,&#xD;
yes. But dear me! the farm won't do Mr. Carvill much&#xD;
good at this rate."&#xD;
"It's well he has an honest man to deal with," said&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
"lHe needn't thank himself for it," said Miss Easy-" no&#xD;
not one bit; for Mr. Rodney engaged Ezra Barrington as&#xD;
soon as he knew that your father would not keep him, yes.&#xD;
I suppose he thought Mr. Carvill would never take the&#xD;
trouble to turn him out, and that he would not be quite so&#xD;
likely to ruin himself as if he chose his own farmer. But&#xD;
he did not say that to me-he very seldom speaks of his&#xD;
brother's doings, though I believe he's the only person who&#xD;
can influence them in the least. Indeed Mr. Carvill always&#xD;
looked up to him, yes; but in a queer sort of way too-as&#xD;
if he couldn't help it, and they never are on anything but&#xD;
the best possible terms."&#xD;
"Has Mrs. Carvill ever been to see you Miss Easy ?"&#xD;
said Kate.&#xD;
"Why my dear child ! yes, to be sure-several times,&#xD;
yes. What put that question into your head V"&#xD;
"Because she has never been to see us."&#xD;
"Never at all?. never returned your visit ?"&#xD;
Never-isn't it odd ?"&#xD;
"Very odd, yes, and very rude," said Miss Easy. "And&#xD;
yet-I don't know-yes, I think I can understand it, yes.&#xD;
Well you are better worth going to see than any people I&#xD;
know, Katie: Mrs. Carvill loses more than you do, dear-&#xD;
yes, much more."&#xD;
"It isn't quite pleasant though."&#xD;
"No, not quite; but there are a good many things in&#xD;
this world that are not quite pleasant, yes, very many ; and&#xD;

I fear you must find that out, yes, like other people. Even&#xD;
you, little Gracie."&#xD;
"Even I,!" said I laughing,--" why Miss Easy you&#xD;
wouldn't have other people get the start of me in finding&#xD;
out things ?"                                 ..&#xD;
" Ah child !" she said. "But tell me, were you ironing&#xD;
all day till you came here?"&#xD;
"No ma'am," said Kate, "there was breakfast you kqdw,&#xD;
and Mrs. Barrington ; and this afternoon I sang for a while,&#xD;
and Grace studied German."'&#xD;
"Most praiseworthy occupations !" said a voice behind&#xD;
us, and turning round we saw Mr. Ellis-the minister of&#xD;
our little church. He was rather an old man, though Time's&#xD;
assistants had done more than the great innovator himself;&#xD;
but if his head had grown old, so had not his heart, and the&#xD;
smile that now greeted us was almost childlike in its&#xD;
brightness.&#xD;
" Beg your pardon ma'am," he said, shaking hands with&#xD;
Miss Easy, "but after knocking -three times at your door, I&#xD;
thought I might venture to let myself m."&#xD;
"My dear sir !" said Miss Easy, "knock three tifnes! did&#xD;
you? I am very sorry indeed, yes sir.,&#xD;
"No occasion ma'am," said Mr. Ellis, "since I've got in,&#xD;
-if I hadn't, we might both have been sorry together. I&#xD;
needn't ask any questions of you young ladies-I ope the&#xD;
half of Mr. Howard's family that is at home, is as well as&#xD;
the half that is here ?"&#xD;
"Papa is away sir," I said, "but I' don't know but half&#xD;
the family is at home still."&#xD;
"Yes, and a large half too-no disparagement to the rest.&#xD;
And how are you Miss Caffery ?-better I should think,-&#xD;
and when is Miss Bamn coming back?.'"          edt&#xD;
" I am better to-day, yes sir; and Avarintha expected to&#xD;
be here this week, yes, but I hear this morning that she has&#xD;
changed her mind."&#xD;
"So, so !-why she seems to like Ashton.",&#xD;
0 'she is not there now, she has gone further west."&#xD;
"But I should think you'd want her here," said Mr. Ellis&#xD;
knitting his brows a little-" you are not well."&#xD;
" 0 yes-but then she's enjoying herself so much," said&#xD;
Miss Easy apologetically; "and besides, yes, I can hardly&#xD;

I&#xD;

DOLLARS AND UENT.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
want anything while these children come to see me so often,&#xD;
-yes, that makes up for everything."&#xD;
"And how does Miss Howard like to be called a child ?"&#xD;
said Mr. Ellis turning to Kate with a smile.&#xD;
A'Very much," said she smiling in turn.&#xD;
"And are you both learning German ?"&#xD;
"Yes sir, we study it together."&#xD;
"Do you know Italian Miss Kate ?"&#xD;
"Only half sir,.-I did study it for a time."&#xD;
"And why not now? what made you give it up ?"&#xD;
Kate coloured a little-" I thought it would be of no use&#xD;
to me sir, and I parted with all my Italian books. I have&#xD;
been very sorry since."&#xD;
" Ah that was a mistake !" said the old man gently,-." a&#xD;
great mistake to suppose that any kind of harmless know.&#xD;
ledge could help being useful. And yet it's the very one&#xD;
that many people fall into, just when they ought to be most&#xD;
clear of it,-when they are ranging themselves with those&#xD;
whom the world calls not only fanatical, but illiterate and&#xD;
low-bred."&#xD;
"And often justly," said Kate.&#xD;
"Often justly,-that is, supposing of course that you refer&#xD;
to my two last adjectives. Strange! that every Christian&#xD;
should not feel as wrote some old author: 'I would acquire&#xD;
all knowledge, I would dowhatever could perfect mind and&#xD;
character, that I might lay it all at the foot of the cross.' I&#xD;
may not give the exact words, but that is the idea."&#xD;
"It is seldom' that you hear a clergyman say that," said&#xD;
Miss Easy smiling ; "yes, very seldom."&#xD;
" Ma'am," said Mr. Ellis, bringing one hand down em-&#xD;
phatically upon the other, "in my opinion clergymen are,&#xD;
under a delusion that they don't pay more attention to&#xD;
such things., They should not neglect 'the weightier mat-&#xD;
ters of the law'--God forbid ! but manners and education&#xD;
may be perfected with little more outlay than of care and&#xD;
attention. Why should a man give people a chance to&#xD;
pour contempt on his message, by delivering it in bad&#xD;
English ?--or make his presence distasteful by the'want of&#xD;
that nicety of dress and habits, which the world holds in so&#xD;
great esteem ? I say not they are excusable for the sneer&#xD;
or the con tempt, but such things will have their effect-&#xD;

&#xD;
ought to have.; and. I do know from experience 'and obser-&#xD;
vation, that humanly speaking, a minister's christian efforts&#xD;
are greatly furthered by the manners and conversation of&#xD;
a gentleman."&#xD;
'Lovely and of good report,"' said Miss Easy..&#xD;
"Exactly ma'am; and lovely as the picture may be in&#xD;
some respects, it will neither be of so good report. nor so&#xD;
well appreciated, if the glass before it be dull and covered&#xD;
with dust. Christians should-give the world no handle, no&#xD;
occasion of reproach: and therefore Miss Kate I would set&#xD;
very wide bounds to the field of knowledge, and go over&#xD;
itin full career,-being careful always not to encroach upon&#xD;
higher duties. I would not leave all the breeding and&#xD;
manners and education in the hands of the world! let the&#xD;
tide of christian influence be: swelled by every harmless&#xD;
auxiliary."&#xD;
"You would have liked Whitefield Mr. Ellis," said&#xD;
Kate,-" you know he is said to have been so particular&#xD;
about everything, that even when dining quite alone, he&#xD;
would care for the whiteness of the cloth and the line-and-&#xD;
rule arrangement of the dishes."&#xD;
"Was he indeed? I don't remember to have met with&#xD;
that; thank you Miss Kate for furnishing me with such a&#xD;
precedent; I am exactly of his. mind. But by the way&#xD;
Miss Caffery, speaking of manners and education, when do&#xD;
you, expect, Mr. Collingwood home? coming for the holi-&#xD;
days, isn't he ?"&#xD;
" Oyes, sir," said Miss Easy with a smile, "dear me, yes,&#xD;
to be sure !-before that I hope."&#xD;
"Won't stay at the.Lea, will he ma'am?"'&#xD;
"I don't believe there'll be any one there to stay with ;&#xD;
but he'll be here, yes sir, the most of the time."&#xD;
" Glad of it," said Mr. Ellis energetically-" I shouldn't&#xD;
see him, once. a week if he set himself down among those&#xD;
monkeys."&#xD;
"Monkeys!" said Miss Easy, "why Mr. Ellis, yes sir,&#xD;
they haven't got monkeys there too ?"&#xD;
" My dear ma'am they've got plenty of two-legged ones&#xD;
Fm sure: whether any of the real Monboddo progenitors&#xD;
of our race have yet arrived, I can't say. For my part&#xD;
U'd. rather see. Simon Pure than his imitators. You needn't&#xD;

CHAPTER XXIV.&#xD;
f see a column of slow-rising smoke&#xD;
O'ertop the lofty wood that skirts the wild.&#xD;
CowPER.&#xD;
IT was October-with all the peaceful fairness of its blue&#xD;
skies, and all the frosty stillness of its nights; and the&#xD;
dainty colouring of its woodland that might have vied with&#xD;
the Lorius at Daisy Lea. Nor woodland alone ; for while&#xD;
the lawn and sheltered hill-side were yet green and unfrost-&#xD;
bitten, there was many an acre that chewed brown from the&#xD;
recent ploughing, and many a field where, despite Mr. Car-&#xD;
vill's prohibition, his Suidce yet gleaned among the yellow&#xD;
stubble. The locusts had long forsaken the, great maple&#xD;
before our house, and in their stead a few katy-dids began&#xD;
to sing as soon after sunrise as they could get warm enough.&#xD;
Poor things ! their slow doubtful "ka-ty-did !" told of cold&#xD;
weather: my father said it quite made his heart ache;&#xD;
though as we laughingly reminded him, it was not many&#xD;
weeks since he would have drowned them all in the Red&#xD;
Sea if he could. As for the dapper little brown crickets,&#xD;
they were facing life bravely ; as cheery and hopeful in&#xD;
chirp and gait as if they were nothing daunted by the white&#xD;
frost--nothing doubtful of spending a most agreeable under-&#xD;
ground winter,-they prepared for it daily. The spring&#xD;
birds had forsaken us, and now came visiters-a flock. of&#xD;
robins to breakfast on our lawn, or a little band of ruby-&#xD;
crowned wrens to take a night's lodging in our evergreens.&#xD;
Sometimes too, the sky would be speckled with crows, in&#xD;
numbers that distanced all arithmetic,-whirling, cawing&#xD;
and .clamouring as in debate when to go south; or perhaps&#xD;
as to which should go and which stay,--for we were never&#xD;
without some black representatives in our feathered con-&#xD;
&#xD;
gress. Then came an arrival of my pet:black-caps; or a&#xD;
sulky looking butcher-bird; and then another set of stran-&#xD;
gers that kept me puzzling and wishing for Audubon.&#xD;
Well it was such weather; and Mr. Howard sat looking&#xD;
out at the artemisias and alyssum and xeranthemums, that&#xD;
with the help of mignionette and a late rose or two, kept&#xD;
up their end of the world's progress; and the lake was but&#xD;
another sapphire set in a gold ring of autumn woods; and&#xD;
the wind like nothing in the world but sighs-for the past,&#xD;
for the future-indefinite sighs that come from a heart too&#xD;
full, of it doesn't know what; and my father looking out at&#xD;
all this, drew one breath that was but-too definite, and said'&#xD;
"There seems to be no end of weariness and vexation !"&#xD;
" Is anything new the matter, papa?" said Kate.&#xD;
"Why nothing new as to its being weariness and vexa-&#xD;
tion-I have got a further development of the same."&#xD;
."About what, papa ?"&#xD;
"it's not worth while to trouble you all with it," was the&#xD;
somewhat gloomy reply.&#xD;
"Yes it is," said Kate,-"if you fold up a black sheet of&#xD;
paper it will look very dark indeed ; but open and hold it&#xD;
before our faces papa, it won't be more than grey at the&#xD;
most, and who knows what bright specks may appear ?"&#xD;
My father smiled. "Well," he said, "it would be a&#xD;
dark sheet indeed that your faces couldn't light up. This is&#xD;
not anything so very bad, neither, if it didn't come on top&#xD;
of everything else. But that man Curtis who bought the&#xD;
far  near Wiamee and has beert living on it ever since,&#xD;
n   says that he can't pay for it, nor even rent for the time&#xD;
he has been in."&#xD;
"Is this Mr. McLoon's doing ?" said my stepmother&#xD;
" No, I think not, for I had talked with Curtis, and he&#xD;
was quite willing to take my word about the title. But&#xD;
he's very poor he says-I think every man is-and has lost&#xD;
something somehow, and really cannot pay. So that place&#xD;
is still unsold, with a considerable loss of rent."&#xD;
"But why didn't you make him pay, papa?" said Kate,&#xD;
for my stepmiother sat silently looking at the little fire&#xD;
which sighed and flickered like our waning fortunes.&#xD;
"Haven't you the law on your side ?"&#xD;
"Ay ! and there it may stay. The law is an excellent&#xD;

battery for gold and silver, Kate; but it's rather too strong&#xD;
to be played upon poor, flesh and blood that has lost its&#xD;
wall of defence. I have suffered enough myself, to feel for&#xD;
others. Curtis told me I might send a sheriff to his house,&#xD;
and make what I could by the means, and that he shouldn't&#xD;
blame me; but I never would visit troubles upon' a man's&#xD;
family-I never could ; nor upon himself in that way. Let&#xD;
him keep his home if he has nothing else to keep !-hard if&#xD;
losses and law-officers must invade even there ! It makes&#xD;
no difference how Curtis has behaved-his wife and children&#xD;
would feel the want of furniture none the less because it&#xD;
went by his misconduct. I never should sleep another&#xD;
night in peace, if I thought I had deprived that poor little&#xD;
dwelling of a single comfort."&#xD;
I saw the big tears glistening in my stepmother's eyes,&#xD;
and her look spoke a pleasure far beyond gold's bestowing,&#xD;
as she said,&#xD;
Surely poverty is not always hardening !"&#xD;
" I don't know," said my father, shaking his head-" I&#xD;
think rm pretty hard sometimes ; but a man must melt a&#xD;
little among such sunbeams. You were quite right Katie&#xD;
-the black sheet has faded,-faded so much that I can&#xD;
even seem to see written on it old Philip Henry's trustful&#xD;
saying-'there is no must be without a needs be.' Ah&#xD;
one's eyes get sadly blinded sometimes! But we'll strug-&#xD;
gle -on a little longer, and maybe win through yet."&#xD;
"When will that suit with Mr. McLoon come on ?" said&#xD;
Mrs. Howard.&#xD;

"Come children," he said' after a pause,"'brighten up!&#xD;

"What for ? exercise and fresh air. Get them thi14.&#xD;

"Suppose it should tempt you, papa."&#xD;
"It must tempt me in another direction, Gracie. I&#xD;
must go and see if Squire Brown has any spare -hay, at&#xD;
then to ask Squire Suydam to let me have his oxen for a&#xD;
day or two. I have a great mind to tell Barrington to&#xD;
bay me a yoke."&#xD;
"Better not," said Mrs. Howard, "you won't want thea&#xD;
much this winter, and hay is so dear."&#xD;
"Dear enough !-if I live to see another season, I'llstay&#xD;
at home and mind my own haying. I might -as well hav&#xD;
had a pitchfork for overseer as that man McKee."&#xD;
" I would get rid of him," said Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
Can't, my dear. I couldn't turn him away at this sew.&#xD;
son, or at least if I did, it would be hard to get another.&#xD;
0 he'll do well enough for the winter--I daresaf-h neas&#xD;
to do right."&#xD;
"You wouldn't dare say it, if you could once see Vhv&#xD;
work when you are away-or rather not work," said ftiiy&#xD;
stepmother; ",and I'm afraid he'll make Andy. as idle as&#xD;
himself. If I were you I would send him off, and teach&#xD;
Andy to do what is needful. Get Mr. Suydam to send&#xD;
someone with the oxen, and I presume Mr. Carvill would&#xD;
ict you have Ezra for a day or two."&#xD;
"I presume I sha'n't ask him. If ever I am rich enough&#xD;
Ii have Ezra for 'good,-I haven't had a bit of comfort&#xD;
since he went away; and as 'to the rest Pll see."&#xD;
"°But papa," said-Kate, " won't you try to get-omebody&#xD;
else? some new man for the winter ? McKee is anxere old&#xD;
woman."&#xD;
Now among Mr. Howard's peculiarities was that of not&#xD;
taking female testimony with regard to man or Man's&#xD;
doings-a kind of Salic law of evidence. So in reply to&#xD;
kate's request he only laughed and said,&#xD;
"Don't libel your sex, my dear-I should be sorry to&#xD;
think all -old women were like Adam McKee. But a I&#xD;

woods,-keeping carefully to our own grounds however.&#xD;
Threading it was: the path being sometimes a slight wear-&#xD;
ing of the rock moss, sometimes a channel-like passage.&#xD;
between stones and trees; while the eye caught intuitively&#xD;
those trifling way-marks which the understanding could&#xD;
scarce perceive.&#xD;
The trees hung full of their late honours; and now and&#xD;
then as we walked, a crimson dogwood leaf, or one of&#xD;
bright yellow from some maple, fluttered reluctantly down:&#xD;
loth to quit its free waving station for the low ground,&#xD;
already gay with such trophies. The asters were luxuriant&#xD;
in bloom and variety: the small white flowers of some,&#xD;
and the thick purple clusters of others, forming a bright&#xD;
contrast to the bending golden-rods and erect ladies' tresses..&#xD;
Wintergreens carpeted the ground in spots, loaded with&#xD;
their carmine berries; and bunches of other small fruit-&#xD;
red, white, blue, and purple, hung from cahosh and buck-&#xD;
thorn and creeper. Here and there beneath a tall chest-&#xD;
nut the open burrs showed that fingers or paws had been&#xD;
busy; while away on the top of some that were exceeding&#xD;
straight and slim, a profusion of well-filled green pricklers&#xD;
seemed to mock us with just a peep of' their brown&#xD;
contents. Whatever could climb that slippery unbroken&#xD;
bark, must be more akin to cats and squirrels than was&#xD;
even Andy.&#xD;
" How can you ever find the cows in these thick woods ?"&#xD;
said Kate.&#xD;
Every morning I sees where they goes, and then I goes&#xD;
after them," said Andy displaying his whole set of teeth at&#xD;
the perfectness of the reply. "But see, Miss Kate, there's&#xD;
the chestnuts sure! .Och whillastrew ! how will I get into&#xD;
it!"&#xD;
And with an insane desire to ascend one of the tall&#xD;
chestnuts, Andy pressed every member into the service,&#xD;
and began to climb-not on all-fours but on all inches. .&#xD;
"Andy! come down!" said Kate. "You will fall and&#xD;
break your neck."&#xD;
" Sure and it's 'meself wouldn't do that thing," said&#xD;
Andy, whose limbs were beginning to assume a downward&#xD;
movement that could not' be checkedand which soon&#xD;
brought him to the ground with no further damage than&#xD;

"Never mind the chestnuts," said Kate.&#xD;
"Och, they'll be all on the ground hereafter," was the&#xD;
philosophical reply as Andy examined his hands.. "Then&#xD;
for a tree that had. no holt to it, that same was mighty&#xD;
rough !"&#xD;
"Did you hurt your Bands," said I.&#xD;
"Troth and I did not, Miss-that is I did, but it's little it&#xD;
hurts me itself."&#xD;
We rambled on, gleaning after the squirrels, and some-&#xD;
times wishing that their purveyance had been delayed a&#xD;
little; but then again we saw such a picture of rural felicity&#xD;
in a fur coat, that there was nothing for it but to wish him&#xD;
health and happiness,-or as Andy said "success to you !&#xD;
and why wouldn't you be afther throwing us down a few !"&#xD;
Chestnuts were not to be had, but at length we came to&#xD;
an old butternut whose white and brown branches stretched&#xD;
their leafless length in the warm glow of a golden hickory.&#xD;
Aloft there was neither fruit nor foliage ; but snugly em-&#xD;
bedded in the long grass and fallen leaves the greenish-yel&#xD;
low nuts lay in great abundance, and were to be had for&#xD;
the gathering.&#xD;
"Be sure I can asy get them!" said Andy, as with a&#xD;
most grasping disposition he threw himself upon the butter-&#xD;
nuts; and "be sure" we did; and pretty little green heaps&#xD;
soon arose in all directions.&#xD;
Leaving Andy to transfer these to his basket, and to re-&#xD;
fresh himself with cracking and eating, Kate and I sat&#xD;
down upon a lichened--rock, and took in our refreshment at&#xD;
eye and ear. Behind the bit of woodland where we had&#xD;
been nutting was a long stretch.of forest trees, with so&#xD;
thick a sprinkling of silver pines, that it went by the name,&#xD;
of the pine wood. But it was not an old forest, half a&#xD;
century being perhaps the most that had rolled on since&#xD;
some of the trees were hid in acorns and cones, and others&#xD;
had .sprung up from the trunk of some fallen ancestor.&#xD;
Before us lay a strip of greensward strewed with the yellow&#xD;
butternut leaves; then came a clump of cedars festooned&#xD;
with the Virginia creeper in its scarlet dress, and the cat.&#xD;
briar boasting no ornament but. its- dark blue berries and&#xD;

freckled leaves. Other trees, mingled with grey rocks,&#xD;
feathery tufts of brake, and lively green beds of moss,&#xD;
lured the eye on to where the western horn of the lake lay&#xD;
glimmering and sparkling in the soft light. A black-cap&#xD;
or two and a belated song-sparrow, joined issue with a&#xD;
cock whose hearty crow came to us pleasantly from Mr.&#xD;
Carvill's barnyard, and made the stillness perfect.&#xD;
" How very lovely it is !" said Kate, with that half sigh&#xD;
that comes from the hidden recesses of enjoyment.&#xD;
"But it's getting so hazy-just look,-the air was as&#xD;
clear as possible when we sat down here, and now it is oh&#xD;
how blue."&#xD;
" We often have hazy weather in October," replied Kate.&#xD;
"Yes, it is blue enough, the whole landscape seems melt-&#xD;
ing away into dream-land. I shouldn't wonder if I got&#xD;
there myself, with such a lullaby atmosphere around me."&#xD;
" There's more than lullaby in the air," said I laughing-&#xD;
"it makes me very wide awake. I don't think that's haze&#xD;
--it looks much more like smoke, and smells like it too,"-&#xD;
and jumping up I .carefully scanned the sky. There was&#xD;
nothing suspicious in the appearance of south, east or&#xD;
west ; but away to the north the blue heaven had as it&#xD;
were the shadow o fagolden cloud,-so slight that we&#xD;
thought at first it was only a cloud ; but something ins the&#xD;
light curl of its outline, together with its steady ascent,&#xD;
soon told the truth: it was surely smoke, and from our&#xD;
woods.&#xD;
Hastily we went back to Andy, guided by the monoto-&#xD;
nous tap of his stone hammer; and then walked home at a&#xD;
rate which would have left gay leaves and busy squirrels&#xD;
unnoticed, evg had our minds been free. But Mr. How-&#xD;
ard was yet away. What was to be done ? We stood&#xD;
debating the point. round the two pleasant-looking loaves of&#xD;
bread that were baking at the kitchen fire, feeling as we had&#xD;
often done before, that woman is very powerless out of her&#xD;
own sphere; and that with so large a place and no one to&#xD;
take care of it, we were in the same, predicament as the&#xD;
Vicar of Wakefield's- pkiture,--" we wondered how we&#xD;
should get out-we wondered still more how we had ever&#xD;
got in!"&#xD;

nine voice, 'while a corresponding hand swung open th6&#xD;
kitchen door&#xD;
"How do you do Mr. Barrington?" said my stepmother&#xD;
with a brightening face.: "we have not seen you in a great&#xD;
while."&#xD;
" Thank'e ma'am, I'm  pretty smart- -'tain't my fault&#xD;
neither," said Ezra in reply to her last remark, "but a&#xD;
body can't be every place. Squire too deep to be spoke to,&#xD;
ma'am2?"&#xD;
"O he's gone to Mr. Suydam's," said Mrs. Howard.&#xD;
"That's just what he oughtn't to ha' done," laid Ezra&#xD;
with a tone of some vexation.&#xD;
"But he'll be back soon."&#xD;
"You tell him then ma'am to start for the pine wood as.&#xD;
tight as he kin put: some o' them 'ere guns has gone off in&#xD;
the wrong place, and the trees is a burning like seventy-&#xD;
five."&#xD;
" Is that where the fire came from !" cried I. "And why&#xD;
in the world did Mr. Carvill go into our woods?"&#xD;
"It beats me to guess why he does anything," said Ezra:&#xD;
"I s'pose Washington might ha' telled-I kint. But the&#xD;
woods is afire and no mistake."&#xD;
"I'll tell Mr. Howard as soon as he comes," said my&#xD;
stepmother.&#xD;
But Ezra still kept his stand.&#xD;
"The Squire never kin put 'em out himself," said he&#xD;
ruminating ; .".and Mr. Carvill" (Ezra never dignified hinf&#xD;
with the title of Squire,)."is in a takin to know where to&#xD;
ketch patridges-I reckon he'll just have to find out-it&#xD;
goes agin my cons ience to let them woods barn. But the&#xD;
Squire had better come too ma'am-there won't be a hand&#xD;
too much," he said aloud.&#xD;
"And will you help him ?" said Mrs. Howard with an&#xD;
immediate feeling of relief. " O1 should be so mueh&#xD;
obliged to you !"&#xD;
"There ain't nobody in the world I'dsooner help," said&#xD;
Ezra, "and there's some folks I wouldn't nigh so soon."&#xD;
And with one expressive little nod of his head towards&#xD;
that point of the compass where Mr. Carvill was supposed&#xD;
to be, Mr. Barringta strode off in the direction of the pine&#xD;
wood;- adgni~shing Andy the while to " walk up. stor't."&#xD;

Thither too went Mr. Howard as soon as he got home, and&#xD;
with him Adam McKee ; so we were left.to guard our-&#xD;
selves and the house, and to gather such comfort or dis-&#xD;
comfort as we could, from the columns of smoke, their&#xD;
size and drift, and from the gradual westing of the sun;&#xD;
which promised no indefinite length of daylight for the&#xD;
labourers.&#xD;
We had talked it all over for the twentieth time, and the&#xD;
loaves of bread stood brown and cooling upon the table,&#xD;
when Mrs. Howard suddenly exclaimed,&#xD;
"4They'll be all starved ! your father hasn't had a thing,&#xD;
to eat since breakfast, and he's been on his feet the whole&#xD;
time.",&#xD;
"And the men can't have gone home to dinner," said I.&#xD;
"O let's take them something mamma! I should like it so&#xD;
much."&#xD;
To think was to do; and in a little while we had fastened&#xD;
up the house, and with basket and cup and pail were on our&#xD;
way to the pine wood. The road led us to a cleared field&#xD;
at its very edge; the forest now spurning the open ground&#xD;
with a rude bluff, and now meeting it half way on a slope&#xD;
of gradually increasing smoothness. Here the fire had&#xD;
been left to take its course till checked by the greensward:&#xD;
we could hear it distinctly as it ran along among the dry&#xD;
leaves and undergrowth with the rustle of a snake, and now&#xD;
and then with a quick short sound like the same creature&#xD;
lapping to quench his thirst ; while a low, unbroken roar&#xD;
seemed to bring tidings from all parts of the burning dis-&#xD;
trict. Tidings of the fire-not those that we wanted. In&#xD;
vain we listened for some other sound--there was not even&#xD;
a chirp : the birds had all flown off in dismay, and the hot&#xD;
breath .that came in our faces  told of no living presence.&#xD;
We called-no one. answered,-there was no labourer there&#xD;
save the fire. And again that same feeling of powerlessness,&#xD;
with a touch of fear, crept over us.&#xD;
"Mamma," said I, "if you will let me go further down&#xD;
the road, perhaps I shall find them, and then I will come&#xD;
back and let you know. You can rest here nicely till then&#xD;
uare so very tired."&#xD;
Mrs. Howard hesitated, but at last gave her consent upon&#xD;
condition of Kate's bearing me compaliy, and we set forth&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
DOLLARS AND CENTS.&#xD;
&#xD;
229&#xD;
&#xD;
with the basket between us. The road that we took now,&#xD;
was but a half-made one-little more in effect than a broad&#xD;
wood path, but the free access of sun and air had kept it&#xD;
grassy and free from dry leaves. As yet the fire was on&#xD;
only one side, and even there had not come down the hill&#xD;
which rose abruptly from the very road-side: all along the&#xD;
ridge we heard and saw its progress. Now and then a shoot&#xD;
of flame would leap into the branches of some .dead pine,&#xD;
and little inverted cones of smoke went up fr9n many a&#xD;
damp or half-burnt pile of leaves. Still no sign of any one,&#xD;
and uncomfortable recollections of falling trees and suffoca.&#xD;
ting smoke began to strengthen in my mind. We walked&#xD;
on, then came in sight of Adam McKee, sitting on a stone&#xD;
and carelessly waving his cedar-bush extinguisher.&#xD;
"Where is papa ?" said Kate.&#xD;
"'I dinna ken Miss."&#xD;
"Where's Mr. Barrington ?"&#xD;
, I dinna ken," was again the reply. "The maister said&#xD;
to bide here and tent the fire till he'd come."'&#xD;
Again we went forward, then turned and walked back.&#xD;
"1Why child you need not look frightened," said Kate;&#xD;
"don't you suppose papa knows enough to take care of&#xD;
himself ?"&#xD;
"i But if he should have got tired and faint, as he some-&#xD;
times does ?"&#xD;
"1Not at all likely-and then there's Ezra. 0 here comes&#xD;
mamma to meet us."&#xD;
A short consultation determined us to go together as far&#xD;
down the road as we could, until stopped by the youg&#xD;
growth of trees and bushes which were fast concealing the.&#xD;
unfinished work of so many dollars. Again we reached&#xD;
Adam, and having given him a drink of milk went on and&#xD;
on. Long, and wearily and worriedly: still the road&#xD;
bounded- the fire; still were blackened trees, and burning&#xD;
stumps and smoke, our only companions. We stood and&#xD;
called.&#xD;
Hollo !" cane from the distance.&#xD;
We went on joyfully-then stopped disappointed. "Is&#xD;
that you, Ezra ?" called Kate.&#xD;
"I used to think so," replied Mr. Barrington, as he came&#xD;
down the ridge bush in hand. "1 reckon I ain't quite 'my-&#xD;

self in this plaguey smoke. I vow! I think the old woman&#xD;
cud say I was somebody else!"&#xD;
We were very near saying so too.&#xD;
"Where is Mr. Howard ?" said my stepmother.&#xD;
"-Land knows! ma'am-he's choking himself some place,&#xD;
I calculate. If Mr. Carvill was one o' them 'ere spouts of&#xD;
smoke, I'd walk into him in arnest, and put him out in a&#xD;
way he ain't been used to !" and stimulated by this idea,&#xD;
Ezra gave furious blows with his cedar bush upon one or&#xD;
two mimic volcanos, whose underground fires seemed&#xD;
spreading.&#xD;
"That had ought to be the Squire," he said -presently,&#xD;
standing up and pointing down the road to a tall advancing&#xD;
figure,-"'tain't as handsome as a pictur neither, but it's&#xD;
dreadful like him."&#xD;
"1Dreadful like him" it was,-coat off; face and shirt&#xD;
black with smoke and the handy-work of charred twigs, a&#xD;
tall cedar in his hand--my father looked like a figure from&#xD;
the Hartz mountains.&#xD;
"O papa !" said I, "you are tired out!"&#xD;
"Pretty near it. There's no stopping this fire,-we may&#xD;
as well just keep it from crossing the road, and where it&#xD;
has got hold, let it burn. Don't you think so Mr. Bar-&#xD;
rington ?"&#xD;
Ezra took a comprehensive view of the hopelessly long&#xD;
line of smoke, and then gave my father a keen glance of&#xD;
his eye that made words quite needless.&#xD;
"1But stop and eat something first," said Mrs. Howard:&#xD;
"the fire won't get down here for a while yet."&#xD;
My father took off his gloves, and first calling to Andy..&#xD;
and McKee, he threw himself down on the grass and opened)&#xD;
the basket.&#xD;
"I don't know," said Ezra, looking at his hands as Kate&#xD;
offered him a sandwich, " my wife says ashes is clean dirt,&#xD;
but I'd like' to hear what she'd call t'other! However it&#xD;
ain't no use to starve upon manners;" and he too sat down,&#xD;
remarking that it was "as cheap sitting as standing."&#xD;
Certainly if our little group was unceremonious it was&#xD;
picturesque; for effect varies with circumstances, and,&#xD;

out. A dead tree, a dry branch among fresh ones, are&#xD;
singled out by the eye (at least by mine) with particular&#xD;
pleasure; and in this case it may be questioned whether&#xD;
water and soap would have improved our general appear..&#xD;
ance. As Carlyle says of some troop, "singly you might&#xD;
have likened them to Don Quixote; in mass, they were&#xD;
highly dignified ;" and the smoke had at least the art to&#xD;
throw an air of congruity over what might otherwise have&#xD;
been deemed irregular. For Mr. Barrington, without pre-&#xD;
suming to take a seat by the Squire, had yet placed him.&#xD;
self within speaking distance, and their meal was agreeably&#xD;
diversified with scraps of conversation. The two others&#xD;
sat further off, muttering forth information and remarks&#xD;
with that low, uninterrupted murmur which an American&#xD;
would seldom choose to assume, if he could: Andy's face&#xD;
never losing sight of the lunch basket, and expanding most&#xD;
benignly' whenever that was opened. As for us-if they&#xD;
had been in Sunday or even the usual week-day trim, of&#xD;
course we should have stood aloof; but being men in the&#xD;
last degree of smokiness and fatigue, it was equally of&#xD;
course that we should complete the picture and hand them&#xD;
refreshments.&#xD;
My father looked in the basket and saw it was empty,&#xD;
save one sandwich; "with a smile he gave that to his next&#xD;
neighbour, took a drink of milk himself instead, and then&#xD;
prepared for business,&#xD;
"The best thing we can do," said he, "is to fire the leaves&#xD;
at the foot of this hill, and then the flames will run up and&#xD;
leave the road, and we may leave it too, and go home."&#xD;
He caught up a forked stick, and going to a burning&#xD;
heap, brought thence enough combustion for his purpose,&#xD;
and they were soon fairly set to work to meet the fire half&#xD;
way. As my father had said, the flames ran up the hill,&#xD;
but now and then some slight conductor of dry leaves car-&#xD;
ried fire across the road, in spite of their vigilance.&#xD;
"Andy!" shouted my father, and pointing to a whiff of&#xD;
smoke on the =burnt side, "there is fire under that hem-&#xD;
lock."&#xD;
"Show me the bush sir, till I squench it," said Andy,&#xD;
running up to him and away from the smoke,' and hoi g.&#xD;
out his hand for my father's extinguisher.&#xD;

"Get your own bush," said my father a little impa.&#xD;
tiently, "I can't leave this pine tree for a minute-what&#xD;
have you done with it ?"-&#xD;
"It's up beyont," said Andy looking dubious and inno-&#xD;
cent.&#xD;
"'Tain't the only thing I'd like to see there," said Mr.&#xD;
Barrington,-" get it, can't ye ? and be spry,-the bush 'll&#xD;
show itself afore long, or I'm mistaken. Now Mr. How-&#xD;
ard, you just sit down sir, if it's all the same to you-I'll&#xD;
take what knocking up '11 answer for both on us."&#xD;
"I believe I have got about enough," said my father,&#xD;
"but I don't know that I am more tired than the rest of&#xD;
" There'ssome of us ha'n't got enough, by a long jump,"&#xD;
said Ezra with a scornful glance at the Scotchman, who,&#xD;
was giving the fire the gentlest of admonitions. "Here&#xD;
you, Adam McKee! just see to that smoke yonder-Andy&#xD;
won't be back this side of Christmas-and I'll take a turn&#xD;
at this cedar. ,Come, step round, or the fire '11 be to many&#xD;
for us yet."&#xD;
McKee moved off accordingly; but so little satisfactory&#xD;
was his handling of the smoke, that Mr. Barrington mut-&#xD;
tered,&#xD;
"If t'other Adam didn't have more sense, Job couldn't&#xD;
ha' stood him!"&#xD;
And now the edge fire of the road gradually burned&#xD;
itself out, leaving the scorched undergrowth, and heaps of&#xD;
blackened leaves and twigs, and trees with a charred stripe&#xD;
band to tell of its work. On the other side of that&#xD;
arrow passage all was fresh and green among the pines,&#xD;
and the few deciduous trees were unspoiled of their lively&#xD;
hangings. The sidelong glances of the sun fell on them,&#xD;
giving and taking loveliness, while the burnt region was in&#xD;
the shade of evening as well as of desolation. The excite-&#xD;
ment and wild beauty of the fire were all gone, except in&#xD;
the few places where it had mastered some pine or hemlock,&#xD;
and still wreathed them with flame and smoke to their very&#xD;
branch-ends.&#xD;
Itwas all safe at last, and when everything had been&#xD;
onr more inspected, and all possible communication&#xD;
between the green and the dry cut off, we went home ;&#xD;

" ND when is Mr. Carvill going to town'?" inquired my&#xD;
father next morning, when he had disposed of Mr.&#xD;
Barrington's first remark, that "he s'posed there wa'n't&#xD;
nothing left o' the Squire, but he thought he'd just stop&#xD;
down and-see."&#xD;
"When does he mean to seek winter quarters ?"&#xD;
"Not knowin couldn't say," replied Ezra concisely.&#xD;
"And how do you feel after such a hard day's work V"&#xD;
said my stepmother.&#xD;
"Spry as a cricket, ma'am: my wife says I hadn't ought&#xD;
to have come for the Squire at all; but I telled her I&#xD;
guessed she'd find out first time she tried, that a fire in the&#xD;
wood wa'n't a fire in a flower-pot."&#xD;
"I can't think how it happened," said my father. "They&#xD;
couldn't have been shooting in the wood itself, and the&#xD;
ground beyo is low and swampy."&#xD;
" They wa    the mash sir, but there's always dry stuff&#xD;
lies round a fence, and that ketched first; and then the&#xD;
fire kinder gin under the fence and so up."&#xD;
"And what did Mr. Carvill say to your quitting him to&#xD;
help me ?"&#xD;
"Hum"-said Ezra with a little grunt, "his speech&#xD;
wa'i't hardly worth taking down--I reckon he thought if I&#xD;
wouldn't haw, he'd as good holler gee."&#xD;

"And is the Lea house as fp11as ever?"&#xD;
"They wouldn't go-for chips!" was the emphatic re-&#xD;
ply.&#xD;
"They'll have to go, by anid by'? aid .Mr. Howard smi-&#xD;
ling, "a little cold weather would' soon spoil -their singing&#xD;
and sporting."&#xD;
"Singing !" exclaimed Ezra indignantly, "'tain't nothing&#xD;
in life but hollering-'da sight rather hear a chap fiddle&#xD;
'Hail Columby.' And as to the sporting, if the dogs&#xD;
don't have the best on it, I'm beat to know who has-I'm&#xD;
sure it ain't me. Landaakes.! Squire, I'd as lief as a&#xD;
spring rain that you'd seen one o' them 'ere shootin jack-&#xD;
ets stick fast in the mash! it beat;general trainin all to&#xD;
splinters. If I'd ha' been him, ITdha' shot every soul of&#xD;
the rest of 'em, for laughing." And with this graphic&#xD;
description Mr. Barrington walked away.&#xD;
The Lea party seemed to bear the cool weather pretty&#xD;
well,-better than we did their behaviour; for whether by&#xD;
chance or on purpose, they seemed always to choose their&#xD;
shooting ground as near as possible to the boundary line of&#xD;
our property. Morning, noon, and night, dogs were bark-&#xD;
ing and guns cracking all about us, till we began to be&#xD;
afraid to venture out while such unceremonious pleasure-&#xD;
hunters were in the neighbourhood.&#xD;
Meantime Mr. Collingwood arrived, but took up his&#xD;
abode at the Lea; partly because he thought Miss Easy&#xD;
not well enough to have guests, partly, as he told her, be-&#xD;
cause "it seemed best."&#xD;
"Do you feel inclined to bear an old man company in a&#xD;
visit to a young one, Mr. Howard ?" said our good clergy-&#xD;
man as he entered our house some day or two after.&#xD;
"Why, yes-"said my father, "with all my heart-'ve.&#xD;
been thinking of it,-if one could only .  here except&#xD;
across half a dozen--"and in the search   term suf-&#xD;
f.tiently mild, Mr. Howard stopped short.&#xD;
" Precisely my dear sir," said Mr. Ellis; "but it will&#xD;
be hard if your and I together 'cannot get safe across .a&#xD;
half dozen of anything."&#xD;
"Guns included ?" said my stepmother smiling, though&#xD;
tit'. somewhat doubtful expression.&#xD;
"Guns' included, ma'am-by. the help ,of Dec. He'll&#xD;

&#xD;
find out the gunners before they fire, and eat 'em up after-&#xD;
wards, if I tell him to."&#xD;
" O if Dec is along that alters the case;" said Mrs. How-&#xD;
ard looking at the huge mastiff; who seemed indeed as if he&#xD;
would make short work with "a half dozen of anything."&#xD;
Now Mr. Ellis's dog was called "Declaration of Inde-&#xD;
pendence."&#xD;
The weather was so fine, that after they had gone Mrs.&#xD;
Howard and Kate and I, took books and work, and went to&#xD;
spend the morning out of doors: choosing for our retreat&#xD;
a little thicket which was open enough to admit the air's&#xD;
freshness, while yet it sheltered us from the sun. And&#xD;
there we sat in very quiet enjoyment, until, as Ezra Bar-&#xD;
rington had expressed it, "a gun went off in the wrong&#xD;
place."&#xD;
We had seated ourselves not far from the bar-place that&#xD;
opened upon Mr. Carvill's domains, trusting to our ears to&#xD;
inform us if any one approached; but the unseen sports-&#xD;
man had been so still in his movements, that our first warn-&#xD;
ing was the report of his piece. We sprang up, and at the&#xD;
moment a little bird fell fluttering at our feet,-flut-&#xD;
tering but an instant, and then the shot's cruel work was&#xD;
done: the foot was slightly drawn up, then stretched out,&#xD;
and the bird lay mdtionless. Almost as motionless we&#xD;
stood, breathing with that oppressed feeling which finds no&#xD;
utterance; but recollecting immediately that a second shot&#xD;
might follow the first, we retreated; I carrying the bird,&#xD;
yet warm and hanging listlessly over my hand. It was a&#xD;
wax-wing; or cedar-bird, as we often called them: the head&#xD;
and throat and back of a light fawn-colour shading off into&#xD;
grey, and that again into blue: the tail tipped with gam-&#xD;
boge. The feathers were quite unruffled except in one little&#xD;
place wher    shot had entered,-softly smoothed down,&#xD;
as the bir preened himself for his last flight.&#xD;
Quick as our footsteps were, we had but just cleared the&#xD;
trees when we heard some one spring over the fence, and&#xD;
then came an impatient,&#xD;
" It must have fallen somewhere in these confounded&#xD;
bushes."&#xD;
We turned, and saw Mr. Carvill and a companion in&#xD;
mischief.&#xD;

The former had evidently found more in the bushes than&#xD;
he had counted upon; but a moment's hesitation gave way&#xD;
to his usual easy bearing, anid he came forward and "sup-&#xD;
posed we must be well, as we all looked so charmingly";&#xD;
and then glancing at the bird he inquired, "how long it was&#xD;
since I had taken to petting inanimate nature ?"&#xD;
I made no reply, but my stepmother with more stern-&#xD;
ness than she often brought to .bear upon delinquents, re-&#xD;
marked,&#xD;
"You may be thankful Mr. Carvill that your shot did&#xD;
not take effect upon one of us."&#xD;
"Upon my soul ma'am, I am thankful-remarkably so,&#xD;
---wish I could think it had taken no effect except on that&#xD;
little bundle of feathers, but both these young ladies look&#xD;
severe in youthful dignity.' Well-' variety's charming'&#xD;
-even when the 'statu quo' is so agreeable as in the case&#xD;
of the Miss Howards. Miss Grace, shall I relieve you of&#xD;
your affecting burden?"&#xD;
' "What did you shoot it for ?" was my somewhat uncer-&#xD;
emonious reply.&#xD;
"What? the 'burden' ?" said Mr. Carvill, putting his&#xD;
hands on his sides and looking serious,-" wanted him-did&#xD;
'pon my honour. Mrs. Carvill's remarkably fond of wax-&#xD;
wings-,thought she'd like one for dinner; and if her appe-&#xD;
tite changed before I got home (which might happen) they&#xD;
always command a good price-one to two shillings a&#xD;
dozen, I think; and that would be-let me see-just one&#xD;
or two cents apiece. You see even I didn't go to college&#xD;
for. nothing-never forgot my arithmetic to this day."&#xD;
"As your memory is so good, Mr. Carvill," said Kate,&#xD;
"won't you please to remember where our house is, and to&#xD;
keep as far from it as possible in future, when you are&#xD;
shooting ?"&#xD;
"Do my endeavour, Miss Howard-did th     rning,-.&#xD;
hadn't an idea that you were anywhere in the neig bourhood&#xD;
till I jumped that fence,---thought I was off t'other end of&#xD;
my own grounds,-left my wits at home I suppose, to work&#xD;
upon that last lecture of Rodney's. For pity's sake, ladies&#xD;
all, don't tell him of my misdeeds !-between the having&#xD;
killed a protege of the Miss JHowards, and the not having&#xD;
brought home Mrs. Carnill's dinner, there would be nothing&#xD;

he added.&#xD;
"You had better cut it at once," said. his companion.&#xD;
"Cut your own and welcome," replied ig. Carvill'; "but&#xD;
I have some feeling, and.cannot leave Mss-Grace in such a&#xD;
distressed state;of mind. Let;me see: if the. wound is mor-&#xD;

go.&#xD;

don't suppose he had the smallest idea what was the. matter&#xD;
with him... Well, if' Rodney was- safe in Cumberland, I'd&#xD;
take this chez ma femmrne,, but I've. no notion of having a&#xD;
rescue attempted,,--so farewell wax-wing-melancholy tro-&#xD;
phy of a good shot !?' and with one powerful fling he-sent&#xD;
the bird whirling over the tops of the trees.. Then kissing&#xD;
the tip of his shooting-glove, Mr.. Carvill sprang over the'&#xD;
fence again, and fired us a parting air-salute from the. other&#xD;
side: which just.served to exhaust the small remnant of our&#xD;
patience.&#xD;
"He is the most unendurable man I ever saw !" exclaimed&#xD;
Kate.&#xD;
" O Dec !" I said; as the dog dashed in between us, "if&#xD;
you had only 'been here, to give them, at least- a good bark-&#xD;
ing for their pains !"&#xD;
Dec flourished about with his nose to.the ground. and.&#xD;
with now and then a smothered growl of discovery ordis'&#xD;
approbation, as if he fully entered into my wish; and then&#xD;
subsided into a very quiet dog-trot. to. follow his master&#xD;
home.&#xD;
"We did' not find our friend, after all," said my father,&#xD;
" and Mrs.. Oarvil either couldn't or wouldn't say where he&#xD;
was."&#xD;
"So y Mrs. Carvill?"&#xD;
"I. saw ,rs:. Carvd.i-with about as much satisfaction as&#xD;
she saw me. She has taken a fair draught of Lethe since&#xD;
last spring-I had.some thoughts of making Mr. Ellis in-&#xD;
troduce me. Ah here comes;the very person we were in&#xD;
search: of. Mr. Collingwood, we have voted you blessed&#xD;
with an invisible cap."&#xD;
Mr.. Colbingwood made. some light answer to this remark,&#xD;
&#xD;
but he looked ill at ease--very grave, very sad ; so that we&#xD;
scarcely knew what to talk about, lest we should touch the&#xD;
wrong subject. We had established ourselves onee more&#xD;
under the trees, but he declined to sit down; and though he&#xD;
took past iri the conversation, it was with the air of a man&#xD;
whose thoughts are far away from his woeds-very different&#xD;
from his usual manner. Once I tried to call home his ab.&#xD;
straction by some laughing remark about Wolfgang, but&#xD;
the expression which followed his smile, seemed graver than&#xD;
ever.&#xD;
"I was surprised to hear from Mrs. Carvill that you&#xD;
leave us this week," said my father.&#xD;
"Yes sir, to-morrow."&#xD;
"And when are you coming again?", asked Mrs; How-&#xD;
ard.&#xD;
"Not till December; unless-I may perhaps come&#xD;
before."&#xD;
"And then you will stay at the Bird's Nest ?"&#xD;
"So I have just promised Miss Easy."&#xD;
"You have seen her to-day then, and how is she ?" said&#xD;
my stepmother, striking out upon what she thought must&#xD;
be a safe tack.&#xD;
But the shade deepened painfully upon Mr. Rodney's&#xD;
face as he answered,&#xD;
"I do not see much change in her, Mrs. Howard-,--she,&#xD;
says she feels stronger than when I came home."&#xD;
My stepmother looked at him, with that woman's eye&#xD;
which reflects as truly the shadows of twilight as the dis-&#xD;
tinct figures of noonday ; and saw-I could not tell what,&#xD;
but merely saying that she had been out long enough she&#xD;
left ,us' and went to the house. Thither- we followed her,&#xD;
but more leisurely ; and Mr. Rodney assuming at least an&#xD;
appearance of cheerfulness, asked Kate anme totake- a&#xD;
walk with him. There was no need toi k twice, and&#xD;
though our spirits had been a little damped by the con-&#xD;
straint of the previous half hour, the mere exercise of get-&#xD;
ting ready quitesrestored them. We came into the parlour&#xD;
in a mood"too gay almost to notice the faces there, or to&#xD;
perceive the pause that every tongue made at our entrances&#xD;
But Kate presently recollected it.&#xD;

the house, "what were you all talking about when we came&#xD;
down? Mamma was telling you that perhaps you were&#xD;
mistaken,-I meant to have asked her then, but something&#xD;
put it out of my head."&#xD;
"Will you forgive me Miss Kate, if I do not answer you&#xD;
now ?" he said, as he stooped to let down the bars. .,&#xD;
"I suppose I shall have to," said Kate laughing-"hap-.&#xD;
pily curiosity is not one of my. ruling passions. But aren't&#xD;
you taking us in the way of powder and shot ?"&#xD;
"No," said he, consulting his watch, "not at this hour.&#xD;
Carvill's companions in arms are not romantic enough to&#xD;
shoot all day without eating, and this is about their luncheon&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"Don't you ever shoot, Mr. Rodney ?"&#xD;
" I have done such a thing Gracie, but of late years my&#xD;
taste has lain another way. Indeed I never thoroughly&#xD;
liked the business; and when I found that I must 'get used&#xD;
to it' before it could give me more pleasure than pain, I&#xD;
came to the conclusion that I didn't wish to get used to it,&#xD;
and shouldn't think so much of myself if that point were&#xD;
attained."&#xD;
I said we were in a gay mood, though there was no par-&#xD;
ticular cause; but it was with us that happy time of life&#xD;
when the heart dances to its own music-as it, never can&#xD;
dance to any other ! The trying circumstances of the last.&#xD;
year had but partially sobered us,-they were but a weight&#xD;
put in one scale, not the long-continued strain which a last&#xD;
destroys the spring of the balance, so that it never rises&#xD;
again to its fair equilibrium. Thus the soberness was&#xD;
quickly shaken off when past annoyances were old and the&#xD;
new not come; and this was such an interval, and we were&#xD;
full of enjoyment. Mr. Collingwood half caught the infec-&#xD;
tion, in spite f himself as it were, and in a little while&#xD;
talked and lod  d much as usual: though when after a few&#xD;
minutes silence we turned to say something to him, we&#xD;
could often see that both eye and mouth had resumed their&#xD;
thoughtfully grave lines and expression. And yet that day&#xD;
alone might have cheered any one. It was' colder than&#xD;
the day of our fire in the woods, but with such a sky ! and&#xD;
air that seemed almost as rarefied and sparkling as Cham-&#xD;
pagne.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Mr. Rodney," said Kate, "if I thought you would-not&#xD;
be displeased, I should advance an opinion."&#xD;
"You may venture," he said with a smile.&#xD;
"One has no right to put oneself under a cloud in such&#xD;
weather."-&#xD;
"I agree to that perfectly Miss Kate-with this slight&#xD;
qualification: one has as good a right in fair weather as in&#xD;
foul."&#xD;
"1But not so good reason ?" said Kate with the kind of&#xD;
look that the sun sends through a fog.&#xD;
"Voluntary clouds are unreasonable things at best," said&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood, but with no perverse closing of the fog&#xD;
around him; "and truly I have no excuse to plead but human&#xD;
nature-that will sometimes concern itself about those&#xD;
possibilities which are not its care. Gracie, here is wych-&#xD;
haiel,-weren't you wishing for some yesterday'?"&#xD;
"1This is one of the prettiest of our wild shrubs," said&#xD;
Kate, as we broke off some of the twigs that displayed&#xD;
alternately their bright yellow flowers and large brownish&#xD;
yellow leaves,&#xD;
" Is that the power of' 'a name'?" said Mr. Rodney.&#xD;
"Partly, perhaps-or of the association the name brings&#xD;
with it. But I have wished sometimes that one could re-&#xD;
solve the near presence ,of things-joy and sorrow and&#xD;
danger-as easily as the old diviners thought they could&#xD;
find water with one of these hazel twigs."&#xD;
"So do not I !" said our companion. "If I were to wish&#xD;
at all, it would be for a guide to 'the wells of consolation'&#xD;
-one that should point upward and not downward-and&#xD;
that we have alreadly."s&#xD;
"Andyet," said Kate, whom I half suspected to have a&#xD;
secret purpose in wat'she said, "and yet Mr.todney if I&#xD;
could tell-if I were sure of happiness to-morrow, to-day's&#xD;
grief would not so much affect me."&#xD;
"Well," he said, "you may be sure of it-only call&#xD;
to-morrow heaven sand to-day earth.&#xD;
"''Tis b* the faithi of joys to come,&#xD;
Wew       a through deserts dork as night."'&#xD;
His eye had' b rightened and his brow cleared, and Kate's&#xD;
smile as she turned from the bush and went on, made me&#xD;

sure that I had guessed right. But for some time we&#xD;
walked in silence.&#xD;
We had crossed a piece of woodland that skirted the&#xD;
high -road, and were about to cross that too, when the gal-&#xD;
loping tread of a horse came flying along at a rate that&#xD;
made us pause.&#xD;
"1Here is somebody who has got used to several things,&#xD;
I should think," said Kate. "Apparently she has not your&#xD;
ideas of self-esteem Mr. Rodney."&#xD;
The apparition came on, surrounded with a cloud of&#xD;
drapery that would have been graceful had it been aught&#xD;
but dust,-as it was the brown steed and his rider loomed&#xD;
dimly out from what seemed a most uncomfortable atmos.&#xD;
pherg-it made one clear one's throat to look at them.&#xD;
But the wreaths rolled gently off towards 'us, and settled&#xD;
pleasantly upon our sunbonnets and dresses, when the&#xD;
lady after returning Mr. Rodney's bow, wheeled her horse&#xD;
and came to a sudden stop just in front of us. Dust was&#xD;
certainly not the only thing with which she was familiar.&#xD;
A light fowling-piece lay carelessly across her saddle, at&#xD;
the side of which hung the game-bag; its contents suffi-&#xD;
ciently made known by the partridge and quail heads that&#xD;
hung limp and bloody through its meshes. The lady's&#xD;
dress was as near an approach to shooting trim as com-&#xD;
ported with the retention of petticoats: powder-flask and&#xD;
shot-bag were not wanting, and our eyes ascended with&#xD;
increasing wonder to the fair hair and face of the second&#xD;
Miss Brown, and her little straw cap.&#xD;
"Good-morning Mr. Collingwood," she said. "Will&#xD;
you have the goodness to come and look at this buckle ?&#xD;
I saddled my horse in such a hurry that I have been in&#xD;
momentary expectation of a downfal."&#xD;
" If you will permit me to say so, Miss Harriet," said&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood as he obeyed her commands, "saddling a&#xD;
horse is the very last thing that should be done in a&#xD;
hurry."&#xD;
"It was the last thing I did in mina," said the young&#xD;
lady laughing, "for I was all ready'befoie'I touched him,--.-&#xD;
but I always do it in a hurry, for thit matter."&#xD;
"You should not do it at all then," pursued Mr. Colling-&#xD;
wood.'&#xD;

&#xD;
" Then I never should ride.-Jack's always ploughing or&#xD;
something else, and the Squire won't be bothered. Can't&#xD;
it ever be done fast and well ?"&#xD;
"By an experienced hand."&#xD;
"I wish you'd experience'my hand," said Miss Brown-&#xD;
"I never had any one to teach me how. Come Mr. Col-&#xD;
lingwood, say you'll ride over to-morrow and give me a&#xD;
lesson."&#xD;
"I must ride to Cumberland to-morrow.     There; I&#xD;
believe the buckle is all right-Why didn't you make&#xD;
Carvill give you a lesson before you mounted, Miss&#xD;
Harriet ?"&#xD;
"How did you know I had been there ?"&#xD;
"'I can see a church by daylight,"' replied Mr. Rodney&#xD;
smiling.&#xD;
"Well but look here, why don't you compliment me on&#xD;
my skill ?-shot every one of these myself," she said,&#xD;
shaking the bag with its dangling appendages; "I did upon&#xD;
my word."&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood made no reply except by an involun-&#xD;
tary step back, which to us was sufficiently expressive.&#xD;
"Where are you going ?" said Miss Brown. "I haven't&#xD;
half done talking to you."&#xD;
"But it will not do to try a lady's patience unduly, and&#xD;
I have left two waiting for me. Is there any other buckle&#xD;
you wish me to examine, Miss Harriet ?"&#xD;
"Half a dozen. Why bless me! what a squire of&#xD;
dames you would make ! Don't you know it's always the&#xD;
distressed damsel that claims most of the attention of a&#xD;
true knight ?"&#xD;
"Rather a sudden promotion from squire to-knight, isn't&#xD;
it ?" said Mr. Collingwood, whose attention was just then&#xD;
bestowed upon the horse's head-gear.&#xD;
" Answer me and I'll answer you."&#xD;
"It may perhaps be questioned," said he with a smile,&#xD;
" whether the distressed damsel is the one who carries&#xD;
powder and shot."&#xD;
"You are enough to provoke anybody! Here, I'll set&#xD;
your conscience at rest," said Miss Harriet riding up to the&#xD;
stone where we had seated ourselves,-" Mr. Collingwood&#xD;

yon please to excuse this gentleman while he examines&#xD;
my girths and martingal ?"&#xD;
"Certainly," Kate said, in a tone of such quiet good-&#xD;
breeding as sounded strangely after Miss Brown's rattle;&#xD;
and for which she was rewarded by as many examining&#xD;
looks as that lady could spare from her older acquaintance.&#xD;
" Do you know Mr. Collingwood," she went on, "I have&#xD;
fairly lamed my shoulder with shooting."&#xD;
"Does that never act as a preventive ?"&#xD;
"Dear me no! who'd care for such a trifle ?-We had&#xD;
the most splendid time to-day !-I never enjoyed anything&#xD;
so much."&#xD;
"I am-This martingal seems hardly needed."&#xD;
"No matter.-What.are you? tired-of fixing buckles ?"&#xD;
"Nay I have rather more strength of muscle than that&#xD;
would imply."&#xD;
"Well what are you then?" said she impatiently..&#xD;
"I was going to tell you that I was glad. you had en-&#xD;
joyed yourself."&#xD;
" And what made you stop ?-say." "-    .&#xD;
" Never push people into a corner," said Mr. Colling-&#xD;
wood,-" it is dangerous. That girth is perfectly safe Miss&#xD;
Harriet, and your ride home may be quite uneventful&#xD;
unless -you or Peter are wilful."&#xD;
"Peter's never wilful-but I am, so tell me what made&#xD;
you stop,-I sha'n't let you go till you do. Why didn't&#xD;
you finish your speech ?"&#xD;
" I found it was like to be an untrue one, that's all," said&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood smiling.&#xD;
" Upon my word !-so you wish I hadn't enjoyed myself!&#xD;
-well you haven't got the character of plain speaking for&#xD;
nothing-that's certain. I think I won't talk.-to you any&#xD;
more after that. 0 stay-who is that handsome Baltimo-&#xD;
rean down yonder ?"&#xD;
" What Baltinorean and where ?"&#xD;
" Down yonder--at the Lea,--I don't know his name or&#xD;
I shouldn't ask."&#xD;
" There are three there," said Mr. Collingwood.&#xD;
" Well-the handsome one."&#xD;
"I do not think .either of them handsome. But Miss&#xD;
Harriet I really must bid you goodemnorning."&#xD;

"Answer me first-you know who he is-very tall, dark&#xD;
and talkative-"&#xD;
"I suppose you mean Mr. Forsyth," said Mr. Colling-&#xD;
wood gravely. "I do not recommend him to your acquaint-&#xD;
ance, Miss Harriet."&#xD;
"I didn't suppose you would. There, I release your&#xD;
hand and patience ;" and adding something which failed to&#xD;
reach our ears, the young lady rode off, gathering her brown&#xD;
drapery about her as she went.&#xD;
Without a word except, those expressed by a deep-drawn&#xD;
breath Mr. Collingwood crossed the road and entered the&#xD;
pleasant shade on the other side.&#xD;
" Confess that you are out of patience, for once," said&#xD;
Kate laughingly as we overtook him,--" but Mr. Rodney,&#xD;
there is no one left in the road to run away from now."&#xD;
"I will confess and beg pardon both, after such a repri-&#xD;
mand," he said with a quick smile of assurance that it was&#xD;
not from us he meant to run away. "Aren't you too tired&#xD;
to go any further? and you Gracie? I should think your&#xD;
patience might have failed."&#xD;
"I am not tired."&#xD;
"Nor I," said Kate; "but perhaps you are?"&#xD;
"Not with walking. I never can rest after such a con-&#xD;
versation till I have walked it off. There is something very&#xD;
far removed from folly and weariness in the quiet'shade of&#xD;
these forest trees,-it is so pure, so peaceful, that the mind&#xD;
is as much refreshed as the body."&#xD;
"You wouldn't have thought our woods very peaceful&#xD;
the other day-wasn't it too bad ?" said I, recollecting the&#xD;
next moment that I ought not to have said it. But Mr.&#xD;
Collingwood had. that happy, tact which never sees more&#xD;
than the pleasant and polite side of a thing. It would have&#xD;
been difficult to offend him if you had tried-impossible&#xD;
to do it accidentally. So he answered my question as&#xD;
simply as it had been put.&#xD;
" Rather too bad Gracie, and yet it afforded me some&#xD;
amusement."4&#xD;
"Amusement !" I said looking up at him.&#xD;
"I should have said was the means of it. Ezra Barring-&#xD;
ton gave us a most striking account of the whole affair,&#xD;
and I am sure you would have been amused even in the&#xD;

midst of your sorrow. He said 'he guessed Mr. Carvill&#xD;
would have felt cut up, if he had seen Miss Kate and Miss&#xD;
Grace sitting on the stones and looking at the fire.' And&#xD;
Gracie he thinks that your sister 'goes a little ahead of all&#xD;
other young ladies'-so you must forgive him for making&#xD;
me laugh."&#xD;
We laughed ourselves heartily enough, at this represent-&#xD;
ation, wondering privately what kind of a reply Ezra got&#xD;
for his pains. And then having ascended a little hill where&#xD;
the thinned trees gave us a view of the country round, we&#xD;
turned to go home.&#xD;
"There goes Miss Brown," I said, pointing to a dark&#xD;
little cloud on the distant highway.&#xD;
"Does she always do so, Mr. Rodney ?' said Kate,&#xD;
"Not always just so-she generally acts in character."&#xD;
"Why don't you tell her what people think of her be'%&#xD;
haviour ?"&#xD;
"She knows now Gracie, it would be wasting words."&#xD;
"I think you are wrong, Mr. Rodney," said Kate, "she&#xD;
may be just carried away by her own flightiness. I'm&#xD;
sure I would thank anybody for speaking the truth to me&#xD;
in  her place...&#xD;
"In her place!" he said. "My dear Miss Kate if you&#xD;
were anywhere near that, I am afraid I should tell you all&#xD;
I think of it,-more perhaps than I have any right to.&#xD;
Happily there is no danger."&#xD;
"You wouldn't call it waste words, and think we were&#xD;
not worth the trouble?"&#xD;
"The one thing is about as possible as the other," said&#xD;
Mr. Rodney smiling. "But as for Miss Brown-she&#xD;
thinks advice is 'good fun', as she calls it. I have seen her&#xD;
tried, or at least know that she has been,-she rather likes&#xD;
to draw people into reproving her."&#xD;
A slight rustling among the dry twigs made us stop and&#xD;
look; and from a clump of bushes near us a hare darted&#xD;
away with all the speed that fear could give,--there was&#xD;
fear in the very stretch of its slight body across the ground;&#xD;
and its ears lay back to their full extent, as if to take note&#xD;
of our steps. In another instant our four-footed companion&#xD;
had come back from contemplating a woodpecker, and had&#xD;
given himself to the~ pursuit. Involuntarily I clasped my&#xD;

hands at that disproportioned match of size and strength.&#xD;
But the habit of obedience was too strong for instinct, and&#xD;
Mr. Rodney's quick, decided, ' Wolfgang !" brought the&#xD;
dog at once to a stand,-not willingly:- his eye sent back&#xD;
a beseeching request to have the injunction taken off.&#xD;
"Come !" said his master quietly, and Wolfgang turned&#xD;
and walked up to us; but as his head was raised to receive&#xD;
Mr. Rodney's caress, and his eye most affectionately an-&#xD;
swered the word of praise from that loved voice, there was&#xD;
something still in its expression which said it was a pity&#xD;
his master didn't know better!&#xD;
"O here is its form !" I said,-" look Kate-this little&#xD;
round place at the foot of the pine tree, with the branches&#xD;
hanging all over it. The leaves are warm yet! Silly&#xD;
thing ! if it had stayed still we should not have seen it. It&#xD;
has given itself a fright for nothing."&#xD;
A little more time brought us to our own door, but our&#xD;
companion refused to come in.&#xD;
" We have had such a pleasant walk," Kate and I said as&#xD;
we shook hands with him.&#xD;
" It has been' most pleasant to me," he answered, "and&#xD;
has done me more good than anything else I could have&#xD;
tried.  Good-morning, I will not say good-bye till to-&#xD;
morrow."&#xD;
And with a somewhat slackened step, Mr. Collingwood&#xD;
crossed the lawn, and took the little path that led to the&#xD;
Bird's Nest.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVI.&#xD;
The path by which we twain did go,&#xD;
Which led by tracts that pleased us well,&#xD;
Through four sweet years arose and fell,,&#xD;
From flower to flower, from snow to snow.&#xD;
But where the path we walked began&#xD;
To slant the fifth autumnal slope,&#xD;
As we descended, following Hope,&#xD;
There sat the Shadow feared of man.&#xD;

&#xD;
f OW    did we hear it! how did we bear to hear it !-I do&#xD;
not know-there seems a mist over that day when my&#xD;
father came in from his walk and told us, what she herself&#xD;
had said: that the life-current of the best friend we had at&#xD;
Glen Luna(would perhaps not last out the tide of that&#xD;
swift-running year.&#xD;
I say I know not how we heard it, and yet I remember&#xD;
the unbelief-so hard to give up ; the bitter tears, so hard&#xD;
to stay. The anxious questioning of physicians, the un-&#xD;
varying reply-that those months of weakness and ill-health&#xD;
had been but the gradual wearing out from which there was&#xD;
no return,-the gentle drawing back of every bolt and bar&#xD;
that hindered the free spirit's flight. Yet still Kate and I&#xD;
hoped; in spite of the grave certainty on my father's face&#xD;
-the steadfast sorrow on Mrs. Howard's; with a hope that&#xD;
Phoenix like, died and sprung up again from its own ashes.&#xD;
It would live-everywhere but in Miss Easy's presence.&#xD;
She did not speak to us of her daily decreasing strength:&#xD;
she was placid, cheerful as she had ever been ; and except&#xD;
that we found her on the sofa instead of at the window or&#xD;
in her garden, things seemed much as usual. But the eye&#xD;
that met us as we entered the room, the quiet keeping of&#xD;
our hands after the first clasp was over, said, 0 how plainly,&#xD;
" Not long !"-and sometimes the 'steady, absent gaze&#xD;

&#xD;
through the bay-window, spoke of other scenes with which&#xD;
the mind was already growing familiar. We could have&#xD;
better borne an expression that had more of earth. Much as&#xD;
we had loved her for those years of sympathetic friendship,&#xD;
we were drawn yet closer by the love with which she now&#xD;
clung to us-even more than ever,-as deepen the waters&#xD;
of a stream before the barrier that is raised to their future&#xD;
progress. Miss Easy's greatest earthly comfort seemed to&#xD;
be in our society. At first it was little more than the&#xD;
society of heart-even our eyes shrank from encountering&#xD;
hers; and many an hour passed in almost unbroken silence.&#xD;
Not always,-sometimes we ventured to talk, and often&#xD;
read to her; and sometimes-but that was not at first-we&#xD;
sang her favourite hymns. And by degrees, as heart and&#xD;
voice learned to control themselves, we grew to loving all&#xD;
-especially the last-as no pleasure can be loved that is&#xD;
not mixed with one drop of great bitterness.&#xD;
I said there was no spring like that of life, neither is&#xD;
there any autumn like that which sometimes . allows the&#xD;
young heart's summer: when the leaves fall that cannot&#xD;
be replaced, and the birds fly away that will never come&#xD;
back. When the strearn that swept off the rubbish of&#xD;
ever day life is stayed with ice which the spirit will scarce&#xD;
ever have heat enough to thaw away. In the calm we had&#xD;
enjoyed for several months, old annoyances seemed to&#xD;
have faded out, but with this new, real sorrow, how quickly&#xD;
and vividly they all revived ! We felt as if it was the fall&#xD;
of everything.-=-money diminishing, difficulties increasing;&#xD;
and the one friend near us whom we loved and trusted,&#xD;
passing away like the rest! It is not enough tb have the&#xD;
support of one's own immediate family,-a single fibre of&#xD;
confidence that can take root without, fetches much com-&#xD;
fort, and strengthens and refreshes all within. And the&#xD;
fibre takes hold so joyously if perchance it fmnds a soil that&#xD;
neither repels nor dries it up!-it is 'hard ,transplanting.&#xD;
".Yes," said Miss Easy thoughtfully, as we sat by hey&#xD;
one afternoon, 4yes.-we 'have loved each other very moh.&#xD;
Ever since the day when this child came running in from&#xD;
the woods, and stood looking io shyly and quietly at me, I&#xD;

what you were then-yes, every one of you--only better.&#xD;
What should I do without you now I"&#xD;
"I wish you would let us stay here all the time, dear&#xD;
Miss Easy," said Kate.&#xD;
"No, it isn't necessary for me, and it wouldn't. be good&#xD;
for you, dear-no, 1 am sure of it. , I won't let you be here&#xD;
except in the day; at least not at present."&#xD;
" We love to be here," said Kate softly ; and I looked up&#xD;
and added, "Very much!" -and Miss Easy smiled her be-&#xD;
lief of our words, but still repeated,&#xD;
"1Not at present."&#xD;
How glad we all were that Miss Avarintha was away!&#xD;
how 'happy to want her bustling attentions! and though&#xD;
Miss Easy never said as much, we were sure she thought it.&#xD;
indeed she could hardly help feeling the different manner in&#xD;
which my stepmother did everything; for putting heart out&#xD;
of the question, Mrs. Howard was perfect in that very point&#xD;
where Miss Bain was most deficient-" the not too much."&#xD;
A blessed thing everywhere, especially in a sick room.&#xD;
How quietly and thoughtfully was all arranged, provided,&#xD;
or directed ! and by such counsels and example, Kate and I&#xD;
became as Miss Easy declared, "the two best little mice she&#xD;
had ever seen." But my stepmother could not be satisfied&#xD;
that the long nights should be passed alone; and by dint&#xD;
of a true woman's gentle management and persuasion she&#xD;
carried her point, and came to the Bird's Nest every night&#xD;
to take the place we had supplied by day. And then after&#xD;
an early breakfast, Kate and I would have a quick frosty.&#xD;
walk in the morning air, to find my stepmother at her&#xD;
friend's side, reading or talking in a voice that carried com-&#xD;
fort with it. And Miss Easy would say tearfully,&#xD;
"I went to sleep with your mother here Katie, and I&#xD;
dreamed that it was an angel."&#xD;
. The days never seemed long when we sat there working&#xD;
and talking, or listening in our turn-the bright hopefulness&#xD;
of Miss Easy's face almost forbade their being sad: we&#xD;
were half beguiled into her glad acceptance of whatever&#xD;
God sent. But as November fairly set in-as the leaves'&#xD;
lost more and more of October's bright colouring, and flut-&#xD;
tered dry and shriveled from the halfstripped trees w&#xD;
were the days winged !-how was the little wood-pathta&#xD;
&#xD;
'I&#xD;
&#xD;
we trod every morning dark with more than the sun's ab-&#xD;
sence! and as his long beams looked at us over the Brown&#xD;
bluff as we walked slowly home at night, they glanced&#xD;
from my heart as it had been ice-bringing only a quick&#xD;
feelingof pain by their exceeding brightness.&#xD;
We were less constantly with Miss Easy now;,-she&#xD;
could not bear to have many in her room at once, and my&#xD;
stepmother being most'needed, hardly ever left it. A let-&#xD;
ter from Miss Easy's own hand (she would let no one else&#xD;
write it) had summoned Mr. Rodney; and he had arrived,&#xD;
and did very much to help and support both patient and&#xD;
nurse. Still our friend made a point of seeing us every&#xD;
day, but they were quiet visits-little said on either side&#xD;
except by the eye and the hand, and that little almost too&#xD;
much. Many a time did Kate and I go weeping home, af-&#xD;
ter one of those long looks of affection from Miss Easy, so&#xD;
full of sympathy for our trembling. words, so unshrinking,&#xD;
so undoubting for herself.&#xD;
The last few days of November came; and with them&#xD;
all the glory of Indian summer,-warm, sunny, breathless:&#xD;
the remaining leaves unstirred ; the hills blue with haze.&#xD;
.Even Brown bluff lost its ruggedness under the universal&#xD;
veil of that soft sunlight.&#xD;
We had gone rather late to the Bird's Nest, hoping first&#xD;
to get some message; for without this the walk was always&#xD;
one of painful forebodings: but no message came, and not&#xD;
willing to wait longer Kate and I set out. No word was&#xD;
spoken-the bright glory of the afternoon was oppressive--&#xD;
clouds would have been pleasanter. We could not breathe&#xD;
freely in that'4erfect stillness; and as we passed the white&#xD;
curtains-hanging listlessly and unlooped-up now-our&#xD;
steps were quickened, and I saw Kate's hand pressed upon&#xD;
her heart, as if to silence that-too.&#xD;
We saw no one when we first reached the house, and&#xD;
going softly up stairs we entered Miss Easy's room. She&#xD;
appeared to be half sleeping, and with more weariness and&#xD;
prostration in her attitude than we had ever seen-the p0.&#xD;
sition-of the very fingers deemed involuntary. She was a&#xD;
little raised up, supported by pillows, and my stepmother's&#xD;
gentle hands had arranged her hair, and tied over it one of&#xD;
. these handkerchiefs which it had become second nature to&#xD;

&#xD;
wear; and a very slight motion of the fringed ends was the-&#xD;
only token that breath yet came through the parted lips.&#xD;
We gazed fearfully for a moment, then looked round for&#xD;
Mrs. Howard. She had gone to lie down; and there was&#xD;
no one in the room but Mr..Rodney, who had risen at our&#xD;
entrance and now stood at the other side of the bed,--a&#xD;
look was our only greeting.&#xD;
The windows were all open, and the warm light had found&#xD;
its way even in here; and beautiful pictures lay without,-&#xD;
on one side, of the lake-on the other, of meadow-land,&#xD;
then our bluff, and the smoky hills beyond. Again that&#xD;
painful stillness-the chirp of a bird, the rustle of some&#xD;
dry leaf as it fell, were all,-=each breath that we drew was&#xD;
more and more smothered; while Mr. Collingwood's watch&#xD;
measured off the minutes that we were to stand there.&#xD;
They were not many.-[iss Easy turned her held&#xD;
slightly and opened her eyes; and her first look fell on us.&#xD;
The never-failing smile came on the instant-grave, amid&#xD;
all its sweetness.&#xD;
"Came to see me once more !" she said, holding out her&#xD;
hand. "Dear children! yes, they have been such a com-&#xD;
fort !"&#xD;
We stooped down to kiss her, but without venturing to&#xD;
speak ; and then when we had drawn our chairs close to&#xD;
the bed, she took both our hands in one of hers, and giving&#xD;
the other to Mr. Rodney she again closed her eyes, and lay,&#xD;
for a while quiet: the gentle pressure of the hand from&#xD;
time to time, just telling that she remembered and loved&#xD;
our presence.&#xD;
"Katie," she said then, speaking low and at intervals,&#xD;
"never allow yourself to dread anything. Ever since I lost&#xD;
my Mother, one sorrowful thought has been on my mind-&#xD;
that I should die alone,-and see what has come of it !-&#xD;
how safely we may trust all to God's arranging !-What&#xD;
could I have more ?-not one friend, but several-the:best.&#xD;
-Could any sister have been like your mother-could 1&#xD;
have loved my own children better than I love you&#xD;
three !"-&#xD;
"The love is not lost" said Mr. Rodney gently.&#xD;
Again she lay still, but looking out at the bright laud.&#xD;
scape and the declinng sun.&#xD;
&#xD;
"It was from this window I saw your flag, little. Gracie&#xD;
-and thought what a sister it must be for whom you took&#xD;
so much trouble,--how long ago-how past! We have&#xD;
been very happy together-we shall be yet happier-I&#xD;
trust. 'Not lost'-  uno !-it brings some pain, but more,&#xD;
pleasure. I am quite happy-I shall look for you all !"&#xD;
"You are not suffering, dear. Miss Easy ?" said Kate&#xD;
after another pause.&#xD;
" No love-I have nothing but peace,-this weariness&#xD;
only betokens rest-' from this place I cannot so much as&#xD;
see Doubting Castle.'"&#xD;
Another short silence, and then without opening her eyes,&#xD;
Miss Easy said,&#xD;
"Sing to me."&#xD;
But how ?-We had commanded ourselves so far, our&#xD;
hearts had been as it were locked up that no sorrow might&#xD;
come forth to show itself: but that little request told so&#xD;
much of the past, so much of the future, compliance was&#xD;
almost impossible-it was like the touch of a master-key..&#xD;
In vain Kate strove-the words would not come unless tears&#xD;
came with them; and then, thoughtfully kind as ever, Mr.&#xD;
Rodney gave us time, and himself began the hymn.&#xD;
"Thou very-present Aid&#xD;
hI danger or distress  !&#xD;
The mind that still on thee is stayed,&#xD;
Is kept in perfect peace."&#xD;
The words, the tune, albeit the voice that sang them&#xD;
steadied itself with difficulty, calmed us. There are some&#xD;
feelings too high, too much above the world not to stay its&#xD;
tears; and that one breath of 'things eternal' seemed to&#xD;
keep down the swelling of our hearts-to carry them away&#xD;
from  ' things temporal';-and s-ill clasping Miss Easy's&#xD;
hand we sang to her of that faith she had 4o long practised&#xD;
-that refuge she had so long sought.&#xD;
"Another-" she said,-" my favourite."&#xD;
Again we sang, but the words were more of life's weak-&#xD;
ness-it was harder work.&#xD;

was clear as if all shadows of earth had fled away-as if&#xD;

head to foot.&#xD;
Closer Miss Easy held my hand.&#xD;
"He will do that," she said-" for me-for you. ' His&#xD;
covenant will he not break,'-His word cannot fail-see&#xD;
that your trust fail not." She was silent a moment, ad in&#xD;
that moment came the twittering of a bird under the win-&#xD;
dow, clear, distinct-it was like the echo of those' last&#xD;
words, "See that you trust him !"  And Miss Easy look-&#xD;
ing up at us with exceeding fondness and with a smile. that&#xD;
yet shone through tears, said,&#xD;
"Good-night my dear children !-I must not keep you&#xD;
longer."&#xD;
We bent over her, and passing her arm round each of&#xD;
us she kissed us once and again, and then after one more&#xD;
long look, quietly closed her eyes and we left her. But as&#xD;
we passed through the door we heard her say slowly,&#xD;
"No more on earth !-but oh Mr. Rodney, I shall see&#xD;
them in heaven !"&#xD;
And hastily going down stairs Kate and I went into the&#xD;
little parlour, and wept out all the smothered feelings of&#xD;
that afternoon.&#xD;
"No more on earth !"-she spoke true. When we met&#xD;
my stepmother in the morning there was no need to ask&#xD;
tidings-they were written on her face. Gentle, peaceful&#xD;
as had been life, even such was death-" the golden bridge&#xD;
- from earth's clay-banks to heaven's shore!"&#xD;
The Indian ummer still lingered ;-as lingered the smile&#xD;
upon Miss Easy's face,-loth to give place to darkness and&#xD;
decay. It was there to the last,-the soul's own gilding&#xD;
on its broken temple-the written receipt of all the bless-&#xD;
'ings to which she had looked forward. That face might&#xD;

In that very room where three days before we had sung&#xD;
of the hope that was now perfected, we three stood look-&#xD;
ing from the north window. The same golden light, the&#xD;
same soft haze, the same sun sending his slant beams over&#xD;
the Brown bluff; while along the little path that wound&#xD;
about its base, rising and falling with the broken ground,&#xD;
went the little train of dark figures. They were but few-&#xD;
Mr. Ellis, my, father, Mr. Rodney, our old retainer Ezra Bar-&#xD;
rington, Squire Suydam, and some of the poor countrypeo.&#xD;
ple whom she had befriended, were all. We would not have&#xD;
had it otherwise-we would not have had a crowd of care-&#xD;
less ones :-in that. handful of men there were not more&#xD;
figures than hearts; and as they now and then stopped to&#xD;
change bearers, we knew it was a precious office to them&#xD;
all,-knew there was not one whose foot would not go&#xD;
gently over the rough ground, whose hand was not ten-&#xD;
derly adjusted to its work. And so we watched them--.&#xD;
sending our hearts too, with the. procession, till it had&#xD;
passed round the bluff, and in all that fair prospect there&#xD;
was nothing but the warm sunshine of Indian summer.&#xD;

CHAPTER XXVII.&#xD;
I passed by the walls of Balclutha, and they were desolate.&#xD;
O ss lN.&#xD;
T the earnest request of Mr. and Mrs. Howard, Mr.&#xD;
Rodney remained with us for the few days during&#xD;
which he finished and arranged all the business that had&#xD;
been entrusted tohis care. It was not much. Miss Easy&#xD;
had given him her cottage and all its contents, except some&#xD;
parting tokens to us.. But not finding just the person he&#xD;
wished to take charge of it, Mr. Rodney accepted my&#xD;
stepmother's offer of storage-room for such things as were&#xD;
most valuable and easily removed, and then the little abode&#xD;
was securely fastened up, and left untenanted,-unvisited&#xD;
save by the sighing winds and our quiet footsteps. For&#xD;
Kate and I still loved to go there, and to look up at the&#xD;
windows and imagine the light that once came from them;&#xD;
and never did we leave the little far-off church, without&#xD;
going to'the one spot near it that we loved best.&#xD;
It was the night before Mr. Rodney went away; and&#xD;
in that wearied. state of reaction which follows a time of&#xD;
mental and bodily excitement, we were sitting. round the&#xD;
fire after tea, silently musing. For a while I had mused like&#xD;
the rest, and- then my thoughts came back from their wan-&#xD;
derings, and were concentred upon the group around me.&#xD;
What were they all thinking of? I drew a little more into&#xD;
the shade of the chimney and tried to determine. My&#xD;
stepmother I judged was asleep, and no wonder after what&#xD;
she had gone through,-if her mind worked at all, it was&#xD;
under the influence of the same fatigue which had drooped&#xD;
her head upon my father's shoulder, and closed her eyes in&#xD;
such quiet rest. Mr. Howard himself was very far from&#xD;
sleep,-whatever his mind was debating, mine might as&#xD;

&#xD;
well have threaded the labyrinths of the milky-way as the&#xD;
expression of his face,-I could make nothing of it. That&#xD;
did not surprise me,-I seldom could. I leaned forward to&#xD;
look at Kate. She sat on a low seat at the other side of&#xD;
the chimney, her head bent down and resting on her&#xD;
knees; but though absolutely motionless I felt sure she was&#xD;
awake ; and though the firelight shone but upon the hand&#xD;
that shielded the side of her face, it seemed to me that I&#xD;
read its look, even in those very closed fingers. I knew&#xD;
with what steady, sobering effect our changed circumstances&#xD;
had wrought, in spite of the young life that had often re-&#xD;
belled against it,-I knew how very deeply she had felt this&#xD;
last sorrow,-and I thought of her in our old parlour in&#xD;
Philadelphia, and then as she was soon after she came to&#xD;
the Glen, when she talked with my father about our neigh-&#xD;
bours! How little her attitude now spoke of that touch of&#xD;
pride which my father had called her only fault! But&#xD;
surely the pride had taken other things with it,-I could&#xD;
not look at her for a while-it grieved me.&#xD;
She had not stirred when I again turned my head; but&#xD;
as I watched her, a slight motion at her side caught my eye,&#xD;
and as the fire blazed up I saw Wolfgang's paw, stretched&#xD;
out and lying upon her dress. His head rested quietly&#xD;
upon his master's foot, which the other paw protectingly&#xD;
encircled,-if dogs can have presentiments, then was Wolf-&#xD;
gang's position "no for naething."  But he slept profound-&#xD;
ly, with only now and then a portentous long breath.. He&#xD;
was the only unchanged one of the party,-the vicissi-&#xD;
tudes he had seen he had wanted sense to appreciate ;&#xD;
and the three and a half years since I made his acquaint-&#xD;
ance might have been three and a half weeks, for all that&#xD;
appeared.&#xD;
Not so his master. I could see Mr. Collingwood very&#xD;
distinctly though he was a little further off than the rest;&#xD;
but he sat with one arm resting on the back of his chair,&#xD;
and his face thus turned towards me was thrown into&#xD;
full relief by his dark dress,-I thought I had never&#xD;
seen there so small an amount of health and spirits. It&#xD;
was not quite a year since his return from Bermuda, and&#xD;
well I remembered noticing how much brightness of eye.&#xD;
and manner had vanished before the experience of the pre-w&#xD;

&#xD;
vious year. But then there had been the joy of getting&#xD;
home, of being among friends again,-now his best friends&#xD;
were not, and from the next best he was going away. Yet&#xD;
never had he looked more characteristically like himself. I&#xD;
could not see the eyes, they were looking down; but the&#xD;
mouth wore a' singularly sweet and almost child like ex-&#xD;
pression of trustfulness-of the most absolute, grave sub-&#xD;
mission,-submission as it seemed to me that'regarded as&#xD;
much the future as the past. I wondered to myself what&#xD;
possible contingencies he could be contemplating.&#xD;
Apparently my father's revery had brought him back to&#xD;
the every-day walks of life, for his eyes suddenly came from&#xD;
the fire to me, and next took a very particular survey of&#xD;
each person present. Then quietly laying his hand upon&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood's shoulder, my father said,&#xD;
"Mr. Rodney, 'there's a divinity that shapes our ends,&#xD;
rough-hew them how we will.' "&#xD;
Perhaps the person addressed thought the words con-&#xD;
veyed some slight reproof; for he coloured a little as he&#xD;
looked up and replied,&#xD;
"I was not ' rough-hewing' sir, believe me."&#xD;
"When will you be through with-your studies ?" said&#xD;
my father abruptly.&#xD;
"Not for two years and more."&#xD;
"And you will be living away from here all that time,&#xD;
Mr. Rodney !" I said despairingly. "Do you know how&#xD;
long you have been away already ?"&#xD;
"I do indeed Gracie-better than you can."&#xD;
"I don't know where the next two years will place us as&#xD;
they roll on," said my father, "but so long as we are here&#xD;
-so long as we have a home any where Mr. Rodney, it is&#xD;
yours too. Will you remember my words ?"&#xD;
"I could not forget them Mr. Howard," he answered&#xD;
with one of his old looks of brightness and pleasure. But&#xD;
it changed immediately.&#xD;
" Then come to us whenever you can," said my father.&#xD;
"When is your hext time of leisure ?"&#xD;
"Not for some months sir, and I shall be further off this&#xD;
year than I was the last. I cannot tell when you will see&#xD;
me again--I dare not promise myself that it will be soon&#xD;
.....here may. be several hindrances in m~y way."&#xD;

"But you mustn't be hindered, Mr. Rodney," I said,-- ..&#xD;
"we shall want to see you so much."&#xD;
"And as Grace says," remarked Kate, "perhaps Wolf-&#xD;
gang will get tired of us."&#xD;
"I shall get tired of him if he does," said Mr. Rodney.&#xD;
"No; that cannot be,-I fear the weariness will be on your&#xD;
side, if you often indulge him with such a place as he en-&#xD;
joys at present."&#xD;
"It would have been unkind not to let him in tonightt"&#xD;
"And other nights"-I said,-"he is never in the way,-&#xD;
mamma was saying that only this morring-and papa is&#xD;
so fond of dogs !"&#xD;
"Well," said Mr. Collingwood with a smile at my'earn-&#xD;
estness, "I am sure of Wolfgang's comfort; but remem-&#xD;
ber Gracie, you have promised to let me knoW if any of&#xD;
you should wish him away."&#xD;
" You may be quite easy on that point," said my father.&#xD;
We were alone indeed when Mr. Rodney had gone.&#xD;
Not a friend in th neighbourhood for whom we cared&#xD;
much-not one ; and it was fast becoming true that the&#xD;
neighbourhood cared little for us. We did not regret it&#xD;
that winter,-the sleighs that came were so loaded with&#xD;
fashions and entertainments and new buildings, the last ar-&#xD;
rivals of news from town and the arrivals that were daily&#xD;
expected,-we saw them drive off. with pleasure, Mr.&#xD;
Ellis was always very welcome, but he was too far off and&#xD;
too busy to come often.&#xD;
We had taken Caddie back: partly because we could.&#xD;
not bear to have her go to strangers, partly from the belief&#xD;
that Mrs. Howard's health would by no means endure such&#xD;
another time of exertion. And as my father said, "We&#xD;
had tried the experiment, and it didn't seem to make much&#xD;
difference-we might as well be comfortable while we&#xD;
could."  And that was a comfort, to the body at least;&#xD;
though perhaps it gave the mind more time to bethink&#xD;
itself.&#xD;
0 hearts and affections ! of what stuff are they made ?-&#xD;
There was no feeling, no' real loneliness in that distant&#xD;
churchyard ; and yet when the weather changed for cold&#xD;
driving winds and winter storms, it gave me a pang--I&#xD;
never heard them without it; and even the know had lost&#xD;
&#xD;
260&#xD;
&#xD;
2602431&#xD;
&#xD;
its charm, for I thought of it falling cold and thick upon&#xD;
Miss Easy's last resting-place. The solitude was not felt&#xD;
there, but it weighed upon me,-a constant, undefined pain&#xD;
that only declared itself as some bitter blast swept eddying&#xD;
round the house; or when we gathered about our little&#xD;
twilight fire, that shone more on the past than the present.&#xD;
The spring came-but its warm sun and springing vegeta-&#xD;
tion had their contrasts,-.it was like going to some old&#xD;
lookout point to see what changes a year had wrought in&#xD;
the landscape. Ah how many this time ! and there was&#xD;
not a flower or a bird that did not speak of them.&#xD;
Kate and I had determined that the little rose-hedged&#xD;
garden should not be left to utter desolation-we-could not&#xD;
bear the thought. Keep it in perfect order we could not,&#xD;
for it was too far away, but my stepmother agreed to. walk&#xD;
there with us every afternoon, that at least the flowers&#xD;
might be kept trimmed and tied up, and the more flourish-&#xD;
ing weeds pulled away. It was a great pleasure to do this,&#xD;
-there was, nothing in the garden with which we had not&#xD;
some association-that we did not love 'for Miss Easy's&#xD;
sake ; and to spend upon her favourite plants some of the&#xD;
love we bore her, seemed almost a relief. Now and then&#xD;
my father went with us, and applied his strong hand and&#xD;
knife to the Cherokee rose, which had learned that it was a&#xD;
free country.&#xD;
We were there one day, smoothing the earth about the&#xD;
tulip and daffodil shoots, and watching the fair and sunny-&#xD;
faced crocuses that seemed almost to open wider as we&#xD;
looked at them, and Mrs. Howard stood watching us;&#xD;
when Ezra Barrington  came tramping along the road,&#xD;
whistling his favourite "Hail Columby."  At sight of us&#xD;
he checked foot and voice together, and turning about&#xD;
walked up to the hedge.&#xD;
"Well!" he remarked,:"that does go ahead of all I ever&#xD;
see or heerd tell on! You baint agoin to dig it up, be&#xD;
yu"O no, we canit do that," said Kate; "we are only&#xD;
maaking it look a little nice."&#xD;
Ezra gave two or three nods of his head, and then stood&#xD;
in contemplative silence.&#xD;

was a plough or sunthin anotherr run about amongst 'em ?"&#xD;
he said at length.&#xD;
"Yes indeed," I said,.looking sadly at our insufficient&#xD;
top-dressing, "the ground wants much more done to it,&#xD;
but this is better than nothing."  And somewhat .dis-&#xD;
heartened by the recollection how little better it was, I&#xD;
stooped down and began at another place.&#xD;
"I s'pose it wouldn't take me long to fix it," said Ezra&#xD;
ruminating.&#xD;
"But you haven't time," said Kate.&#xD;
"I s'pose I could find it," he replied in the same medita-&#xD;
tive way,-" I never looked for anything yet I couldn't find,&#xD;
'cept a four-leaved clover-and 1 don't believe that ever&#xD;
had existence, though my woman says she's seen 'em.&#xD;
Gracious! Miss Kate," he added energetically, and sur-&#xD;
veying the little patch of ground with great contempt,&#xD;
"why if I had a team in here, I'd put through it afore you&#xD;
could say gee!"&#xD;
"But then the plough wouldn't do," said I; "and dig-&#xD;
ging is slower wtrk."&#xD;
"1That's a fact !" said Mr. Barrington gravely. " I reck-,&#xD;
on I could ha' made that up by myself. Well-so long's&#xD;
all Mr. Carvill's work gets done 'tain't none o' his business&#xD;
what else I take a notion to,-a bit o' fun 'll do me as&#xD;
much good as other folks, I'm thinking. But look a here&#xD;
-I can't come down to this 'ere 'ring o' roses' by myself,&#xD;
-there'd be the mischief to pay, and nothing to pay him&#xD;
with, neither."&#xD;
"0 we would come with you any. time," said I-"when-&#xD;
ever you're ready,-and be so much obliged to you Mr.&#xD;
Barrington!"&#xD;
" That'll work then," he answered: "'cause you see I&#xD;
don't know nothin about gimcracks, and I should dig some&#xD;
on 'em up for sartain. I can tell young oats with any man,&#xD;
but my wife says sun-flowers is quite different-"&#xD;
"'And when will you come ?" said Kate smiling.&#xD;
"Couldn't say," said Ezra looking somewhat puzzled,-&#xD;
"my idees ain't begun to be made up on the subject. I'll:&#xD;
stop down and tell ye. I s'pose Mr. Collingwood wouldn't&#xD;
have no objections? by rights he had ought to be asked-&#xD;
He'd like what was done by anythin of the name o' How"&#xD;
&#xD;
ard, and no- mistake ; but. the name o' Barrington you&#xD;
see's another guess sort o' chap."&#xD;
"I am sure he would be pleased," said Mrs. Howard&#xD;
with a smile.&#xD;
"Well-I guess likely,", said Ezra,-" it don't make&#xD;
much odds-only I'd as soon not get mad with him, for&#xD;
he's a leetle the smartest man I know."&#xD;
The plan thus satisfactorily arranged was soon carried&#xD;
out, and Ezra's sturdy arm made almost as light of the&#xD;
matter as if the digging had been ploughing. And by the&#xD;
time that was done, he had got so interested in the work&#xD;
or the garden or us, as to spend many a grey morning&#xD;
hour in the wheat-field that he might have time to spare in&#xD;
the afternoon. He would interfere most watchfully to&#xD;
save our hands from briars, or to uproot some dock or&#xD;
mallows that had grown tall unperceived; but he never&#xD;
attempted the finer work ; and would shake his head&#xD;
gravely over our raking, and profess that "we beat him&#xD;
gardening all to pieces !"&#xD;
And so tended, the garden flourished and looked gay and&#xD;
lovely as ever, save for the one shade that came from the&#xD;
closed and shuttered Venetian window. And the sweet&#xD;
spring wind that could there gain no admittance seemed&#xD;
to come sighing back to us, to tell of the different recep.&#xD;
tion it had met in former years. It touched my heart so&#xD;
nearly, it found so ready an entrance there, that I could&#xD;
sometimes scarce work for weeping. Wolfgang always&#xD;
went with us, and would lie quietly on the grass or the&#xD;
egravel-walk, contributing his share of interest' and associ-&#xD;
ation.&#xD;
"Miss Kate," said Ezra one afternoon, as he gave the&#xD;
last blow to a support for a' Lady Banks rose, "I hope&#xD;
there ain't much of the cat about me, as is always lookin&#xD;
into other people's cupboards; but don't you think this here&#xD;
garden could live along without you. for a spell? I'd see&#xD;
that there didn't nothin mislist it."&#xD;
"Why yes, FIsuppose so," said Kate looking at him in-&#xD;
quiringly.&#xD;
"'Cause that 'ere curiosity's exhibitin itself agin," said&#xD;
Ezra, as he gave the stake a trial that embodied the spirit&#xD;

"Mr. Garvill?" said I.&#xD;
"Inever see nothin else half so curious," was the satis-&#xD;
factory reply.&#xD;
"Is he here now ?" said Kate.&#xD;
"Come a shootin," said Ezra.&#xD;
"But will he be likely to come in this direction ?"&#xD;
"Couldn't say," replied Mr. Barrington. "If you'd asked&#xD;
me where he wouldn't be Miss Kate, I could ha' yelled ye,&#xD;
and that's to home,-walk over there any time o' day when&#xD;
you'd calculate to find him, and 'tain't lUely you will. If&#xD;
he knowed as much as he thinks he does, he'd be down here&#xD;
straight."&#xD;
"Why ?" I said-" what makes you think so?"&#xD;
"HuM"-said Ezra,-" he likes to fire away at. most&#xD;
anything. He ain't quite*a coon yet neither-so I thought&#xD;
likely he might take you and Miss Kate for pigeons."&#xD;
It was impossible to make out Mr. Barrington's under-&#xD;
standing of his own words, for his gravity was impenetra-&#xD;
ble ;-'-but we thanked him for his information and resolved&#xD;
to profit by it. We did not indeed wish to meet Mi'. Car-&#xD;
viii; and not content with absenting ourselves from the&#xD;
garden, we set very short limits to our walks within our&#xD;
own grounds. Vain precaution!&#xD;
After a chill, cloudy day which had persuaded us to re-&#xD;
main in the housp, a few late sunbeams struggled forth, and&#xD;
Kate and I ran out to enjoy them. It was what the Irish&#xD;
call "a "psfty" evening-soft and quiet; and wrapped in&#xD;
our shawli  , rambled on from one walk to another, with&#xD;
no fear of intruders so near home. But it happened that&#xD;
at the same time, Mr. Carvill-whether belated or tired-&#xD;
had availed himself of a short road across our premises to&#xD;
his own; and we met him without even a moment's warn-&#xD;
ing. As usual he had been after.game, but this day had&#xD;
been unpropitious. His bag was empty, his dress looked&#xD;
wet, and himself a trifle discontented. Wolfgang knew&#xD;
him too well to bark, but the dignified growl and raising'&#xD;
of the ears sufficiently marked his appreciation of the curi'&#xD;
osity-.              .&#xD;
"So," said Mr. Carvill, stopping us short as we were&#xD;

about to pass him with only abow, "so' young ladies, you&#xD;

"Yes, for the present;" Kate said.&#xD;
"Slender piece of time, 'the present' "-said Mr. Carvill&#xD;
-" for the past, by your leave Miss Howard; and for the&#xD;
future I will take care of him."&#xD;
"No sir," KIate answered quietly, but with no concession&#xD;
in her voice.&#xD;
"I haven't an idea what 'no sir' means-except in some&#xD;
circumstances"-said the gentleman in an under tone. "Is&#xD;
this the beginning of the 'nineteen nay-says' Miss Howard?"&#xD;
"I hope fewer than that will content you Mr. Carvill,"&#xD;
replied Kate in the same cool and quiet manner.&#xD;
"Content go to the winds!" he said-" I'm like to have&#xD;
little of it. What's to hinder my taking the dog home&#xD;
with me now?"&#xD;
"I must leave that to yourself sir,-but I beg that you&#xD;
will not hinder our reaching home before nightfall"&#xD;
And by a quick motion we passed him and walked on.&#xD;
But he turned and joined us, after a vain attempt t:o make&#xD;
Wolfgahg follow him in another direction,-the dog most&#xD;
emphatically showed his teeth-thereby not sweetening Mr.&#xD;
Carvill's temper.&#xD;
"I've heard of 'Love me, love my dog,' " he remarked-&#xD;
"never saw it acted out before! Am I to understand young&#xD;
ladies, that I alone am to be debarred from showing my&#xD;
affection i6my absent brother ?"&#xD;
The smile with which Kate had greeted Wolfgang's re-&#xD;
appearance in front of her, gave place to a somewhat bright&#xD;
colour, but she made no reply.&#xD;
"Well!" said Mr. Carvill .rather-sulkily, "silence gives&#xD;
consent to something-I should like to know what ! May&#xD;
I venture to inquire to whom the dog belongs? whether he&#xD;
is a general assignment or a special gage-d'amiti6 ?-or is it&#xD;
a system of mutual trust? I know some people used to&#xD;
think it dangeroustfor ladies to walk alone."&#xD;
"9I shall believe it in future !" said Kate.as she turned and&#xD;
confronted her tormentor. "Mr. Carvill--"&#xD;

a tuft of violets.&#xD;
"Nothing you can say sir, will make any djferenee," she&#xD;
went on,-"I wish you would understand that, once for&#xD;

" Rather a mortifying thing to understand, too!" said&#xD;

an answer-your definitive Miss Howard. Am I to have&#xD;
the dog or no ?"&#xD;
" Certainly not !" said Kate; "he is to stay with us till&#xD;
Mr. Collingwood comes for him."&#xD;
".I wonder what else Mr. Collingwood will come for'?"&#xD;
said Mr. Carvill impatiently turning away,-" I suppose&#xD;
he'll have it, whatever it is! Good bye young ladies-&#xD;
pray don't fail to guard Mr. Collingwood's "dog with all&#xD;
care and tenderness-a proverb sometimes works both&#xD;
ways."-And with steps that promised to give him the&#xD;
benefit of all the wet bushes in his way, our unneighbourly&#xD;
neighbour disappeared.&#xD;
