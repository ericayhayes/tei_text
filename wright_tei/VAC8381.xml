            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <head>BY REV. THEO. L. CUYLER.</head>
            <p>IT is not needful that I write a single word to introduce Mrs. J. MCNAIR WRIGHT to
               the American people. Her ready and graceful pen has been a "door-key" to unlock ten
               thousand hearts; and she has been a giver of good gifts to our Sunday-schools and
               firesides. Nor does this volume need my commendation. It tells its own story. Like
               her previous writings, it is destined to a wide circulation and a happy
               influence.</p>
            <p>Nowhere has the destructive havoc of the social glass been so manifest and terrible
               as among that class of young men who are popularly styled "the best fellows in the
               world." Their excitable temperaments and generous natures make them an easy prey to
               the tempter. They, in turn, become the most fascinating tempters of others. One such
               "sinner destroyeth much good," and will poison a whole circle of companions.</p>
            <p>A touching and eloquent letter now lies before me, which was written by a former
               resident of Mrs. Wright's own State—Ohio. It is in an elegant style of composition
                  and<pb n="4-5 (Table of Contents) " xml:id="VAC8381-00000003"/> penmanship. The
               writer was once in a prosperous business and courted in society. But from a
               charity-hospital—in sickness, poverty, and want—he sends these bitter confessions of
               a broken heart:</p>
            <p>"How I have so far escaped with my life is, to me, a miracle. I have been at death's
               portal a score of times during the past few years. And what has been the cause of all
               my misery and wretchedness? <emph>Rum.</emph> How well I remember the first glass of
               liquor I ever took! It was in Columbus at the —— Hotel. I took it with Mr. K——, and I
               drank it at the time under protest. Could K—— have seen the fruits of that 'sherry
               cobbler,' that <emph>one drink,</emph> he might better have given me a potion of
               strychnine in its stead. I am an embodiment of the fruits of that one drink. The
               bottle has been the skeleton in my closet ever since."</p>
            <p>There are thousands of just such "best fellows in the world," who are rapidly rushing
               on just such a doom. This volume goes out as a warning signal to ward off the unwary
               youth from the fatal first glass. May the blessing of God go with this faithful "word
               in season"! And may the blessings of many who "were ready to perish" be the reward of
               its gifted author!</p>

               <p>TO know a good person is ever a satisfaction, but the happiness of knowing the
                  Best Fellow in the World was reserved solely for the friends of Geoffrey Hunter.
                  The fact of Geoffrey's pre-eminence is abundantly attested; he was by birth, by
                  act, by acclamation, the very Best Fellow in the World. Moulded in prodigal
                  nature's choicest fashion, of a rich and generous disposition, jolly and
                  free-handed, he was lifted up to a throne as the king of good fellows by a
                  plebiscitum of all who knew him. Geoffrey Hunter, Geoffrey the unrivalled,
                  Geoffrey the good fellow, we would type him by the ripest fruit of the most
                  glorious of Octobers—a very child of the sun, as if the day-god<pb n="8-9"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000005"/> god had bronzed his cheek and touched his flowing
                  hair with tawny gold, while all his words were cheerful and sweet from the
                  overflowing satisfaction of his heart. It is evident that, happiest of all who
                  knew him, must have been this good fellow's family. The family consisted of
                  father, mother, and two sisters; of these sisters, Charlotte was Geoffrey's twin,
                  and Eva several years his junior. Between Geoffrey and Charlotte there was not
                  that close similarity that sometimes exists between twins. Lying in their cradle,
                  Charlotte had probably stolen from Geoffrey any little tempers, obstinacy,
                  irritability, or sharpness that might have made him less than the king of good
                  fellows; so, while Geoffrey was left all honey and sweetness, Charlotte was a
                  commingling of gentle and hard, of bitter and sweet, of genial and sharp. By a law
                  of compensation, Geoffrey had most likely won some qualities that rightly belonged
                  to his twin-sister, and here, as ever, Geoffrey's happy star had aided him. He had
                  gathered in all those little talents and facilities which should have been
                  Charlotte's, and this made him such an "Admirable Crichton" that he was every
                  one's delight. Geoffrey could do anything and everything. He could learn a lesson
                  while other people were finding the place; he could compose a song and sing it; he
                  could draw a caricature, tell a story, make a killing pun, deliver a fluent
                  speech, argue both sides of a question at the same time, convince all who heard
                  him, and yet never seem inconsistent. Nature had evidently designed this young man
                  for a lawyer! As for Charlotte, she could only mark out a plan, and diligently
                  follow it up to its conclusion; if she could not, like that pink and admiration of
                  all virgins, Elizabeth of England, swear a round oath, she could say that
                  unbecoming word "no" whenever it seemed appropriate. She could not, like Geoffrey,
                  do half-a-dozen things at the same time, but she could do some one thing
                  thoroughly. While Geoffrey was beautiful, his twin-sister was neither handsome nor
                  plain; her parents called her Charlotte,<pb n="10-11" xml:id="VAC8381-00000006"/>
                  and Eva called her Lottie, while Geoffrey's name for her was Charley, and that
                  seemed to fit her best of all.</p>
               <p>During all their early years, these twins were inseparable. It was necessary that
                  this should be so, for it needed Geoffrey's <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >bonhomie</foreign> to smooth Charlotte's path in everyday life, and
                  Charlotte's decision and zeal to keep Geoffrey in action. At home, when little
                  tasks were given them, Charlotte's duty was quickly done; but Geoffrey, fully
                  resolved to mind his mother, must yet catch butterflies for Eva; convert himself
                  into an elephant draped in a table-cover that she might ride on his back; frolic
                  with the dog, because the dog was lonesome; sing an Irish song to cheer the maid,
                  and chat with the hired man "to make the poor fellow feel at home," until
                  Charlotte either performed Geoffrey's task alone or helped him do it, her own
                  concluded.</p>
               <p>It was much the same at school. Geoffrey loved and honored his teacher, and meant
                  to please him. He also meant to please the boys.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey could learn his lesson by taking one look at it; and in the matter of
                  firing balls of chewed paper, he was as skilful as a sharpshooter. As the boys
                  enjoyed seeing paper-balls fired, our Geoffrey was constrained to occupy much time
                  in stuccoing the schoolroom ceiling and ornamenting the walls with bas-relief; as
                  laughter was healthy, he produced untimely bursts of it by making astonishing
                  grimaces, and for popularity's sake even caricatured the dear teacher, his
                  defects, misfortunes, and deformities, and never meant the least harm in the
                  world. In fact, he protested with tears in his eyes that he had far rather pain
                  himself than his pedagogue.</p>
               <p>In such circumstances, it was well that Charlotte was Geoffrey's seat-mate, to
                  hide the paper intended for balls, to destroy secretly the caricatures, and to
                  remind her brother that the lessons must at least be looked at.</p>
               <p>Finding from the very dawn of reason that Geoffrey always said "yes" and
                  invariably yielded to the last speaker, Charlotte<pb n="12-13"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000007"/> lotte constituted herself a vigilance committee to
                  be near her brother, and when inopportune propositions were made for doing things
                  dangerous or forbidden, and ill-advisers said "Let's do," Charlotte promptly and
                  firmly put in "Let's don't," and so full often won the day. Charlotte was known in
                  her family as a wise, reliable, energetic child, very good to have in the family,
                  but nothing to compare with Geoffrey, the delightful, only son. Eva, the youngest
                  child, was small and pretty, curly-haired and satin-skinned, "cut out for lady,"
                  said her mother, and who had a better right to know?</p>
               <p>The father was a quiet, kind, plodding farmer, who had made a very good fortune by
                  his work, and still worked on. The mother, elderly before any of her children were
                  born, was fat and smiling; wrinkled in face, old-fashioned in notions and in
                  dress; wore two pair of spectacles, and did quantities of knitting-work. The
                  mother clung to old-time ways; she had a fashionable parlor to please friends and
                  children; and for her favorite sitting-room claimed a home-made carpet, a wide
                  fireplace, <figure/> and splint-bottomed chairs. Her children's bedrooms gloried
                  in sets of modern furniture in polished walnut; she insisted on sleeping in a high
                  four-posted cherrywood bedstead, dressed out with fringed curtains, feather ticks,
                  and patchwork quilts.</p>
               <p>A glad, good home was this, where there<pb n="14-15" xml:id="VAC8381-00000008"/>
                  were love and health in abundance, where no one overworked, and none was idle.</p>
               <p>In school studies and out-door sports the twins had kept together, until, when
                  Geoffrey was fourteen, his father made arrangements to send him to
                  boarding-school. The only son must be educated. Mr. Hunter said nothing about
                  sending the girls away, for he had thought nothing of it. They could read, sew,
                  knit, and keep house; he had even distant visions of a piano; but he had a notion
                  that girls needed much less book-learning than boys. Geoffrey was to go to school,
                  and his trunk was packed. Charlotte had watched proceedings, gloomy and
                  brooding.</p>
               <p>It was October, and the leaves were changing splendidly. Geoffrey was to go next
                  day, and, in the afternoon previous to the prospective parting, these twins, who
                  had never been separated, wandered off arm-in-arm for a walk. They turned down a
                  lane lined on either side with sumac and blackberry bushes dressed in flame color.
                  On a gray boulder a redbird sat oreening his bright feathers with his scarlet
                  bill, and turning his tufted head from side to side.</p>
               <p>Here, crossing the rude bridge, they came to a clear spring that welled for ever
                  in a natural basin of living rock; and now there was the barn that held the hay of
                  remote fields, the barn where they had sported many an hour, and which had changed
                  to fairy-land as they sat on fragrant piles of new-mown clover and told tales of
                  elf and goblin. Now the road swept round in a grand curve, and they were between a
                  fence draped in ivy and the green borders of the Happy River, which ran gaily over
                  its bed of rock, where purple mussel-shells clung in the soft banks; the trees,
                  beech, elm, and maple, reached over the fostering waters on either side. Now, on
                  the fallen moss-covered trunk of a butternut-tree, the pair sat down, and for the
                  first time spoke of their parting. As they talked, the greatness of the coming
                  evil grew before Charlotte's mind.</p>
               <pb n="16-17" xml:id="VAC8381-00000009"/>
               <p>"O Charley! what can I do without you!" cried Geoffrey, with indistinct memories
                  of lavished praises, of mittens mended, of handkerchiefs kept from losing, of sums
                  and compositions neatly copied at the last minute, when he had been too busy
                  "obliging somebody" to attend to his own business.</p>
               <p>"You needn't know what you can do," broke forth Charlotte, "for I'm going too. I
                  shall go home and tell them so now."</p>
               <p>She jumped from her mossy seat and started homewards, Geoffrey, as usual, admiring
                  and agreeing.</p>
               <p>"I'm going to school with Geof," cried Charlotte, rushing into her parents'
                  presence. "Mother, you can pack up my trunk!"</p>
               <p>"Why, who ever heard of such a thing!" said her father.</p>
               <p>"And why not?" demanded Charlotte. "I'm as old as Geof, and I know as much as he
                  does, and keep even with him, why can't I go to school?"</p>
               <p>"Sure enough!" said her father, getting a new light on the subject.</p>
               <p>"But your clothes are not ready," remonstrated her mother.</p>
               <p>"Never mind the clothes. I've got plenty, and then you can send me some more, if
                  you want to."</p>
               <p>"But they won't take you; it's a boys' school," interposed her father, looking
                  greatly perplexed.</p>
               <p>"Send Geof to a school where they will take me. We have never been away from each
                  other—and we cannot be. Geof would not know how to get on if I wasn't there."</p>
               <p>"I wish you <emph>would</emph> send Geoffrey to a school where they took both boys
                  and girls, and send Charlotte with him," said Mrs. Hunter to her husband. She laid
                  down her knitting, and solemnly scanned her son through one pair of spectacles,
                  while the other pair were set high on her forehead. Then she reversed the position
                  of the spectacles, and bringing down the upper pair, she reviewed him through
                  those; then she set both pair of spectacles on the top of her head, and
                     scrutinized<pb n="18-19" xml:id="VAC8381-00000010"/> Master Geoffrey with those
                  mild, blue eyes that could never see harm in any one.</p>
               <p>"Yes," she said; "our Geoffrey is a good boy, the best boy in the world; and yet,
                  come to think of it, it seems as if it is our Charlotte that has brought him
                  through straight so far, and as if without her he'd be—a little <emph>too
                     good</emph> for anything. Bread can be overlight, and yeast overlively, and
                  cake too rich, and coffee too sweet; and I do think, father, you'd better keep
                  those two together. Likely the Lord knew that they needed each other when he made
                  'em twins."</p>
               <p>Charlotte saw that her cause was won, and over her grave, resolute child-face
                  dawned a smile like the creeping up of crocus bloom in spring.</p>
               <p>"The keeping together cannot always be," said Mr. Hunter, touched with some new
                  sorrow at the thought</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey is to study law, Charlotte, and what then?"</p>
               <p>"I shall study law, too," said Charlotte the bold.</p>
               <p>"But he must go to college, and <emph>there</emph> they will not let girls
                  go."</p>
               <p>"They ought to," said Charlotte—"girls that have heads on them, and will study,
                  and can pay. When Geoffrey goes to college, I will go to the same place, and get
                  the same books, and see him, and learn the same lessons every day."</p>
               <p>"Mother," said Mr. Hunter, turning to his wife, "mother, I believe she will."</p>
               <p>Very likely her father's faith had much to do with fixing this girl in her
                  resolves. A new school was selected where the brother and sister might be sent.
                  The preparations were hurried, for Charlotte insisted that she did not need a
                  large outfit. With some strange prescience the girl said to her mother: "Don't do
                  too much for me now, mother; Geoffrey will cost more than you think. Save your
                  money for him."</p>
               <p>When Mr. Hunter arrived at "Walford Seminary" with his two children, the faculty
                  at once fell in love with the handsome, gracious lad, who looked into their<pb
                     n="20-21" xml:id="VAC8381-00000011"/> faces with such a genial smile, spoke
                  such cheery, prompt replies, and seemed so thoroughly to know what to do with
                  himself. The preceptress, a woman wise in experience, studied Charlotte's face for
                  a few moments, and announced that she should make her the room-mate of little Zell
                  Ranleigh. Now, little Zell was an orphan with a small fortune, who was sent to
                  school because no one knew what else to do with her, and had become in some sort
                  the baby of the establishment. In concluding to put Charlotte with Zell, the
                  preceptress showed that she placed unlimited confidence in the stranger. While Mr.
                  Hunter went with his son and the principal to the large stone building, where, in
                  charge of their tutors, the boys had their lodging and study rooms, the
                  preceptress took Charlotte to her room and her new companion. Zell, a charming,
                  vivacious seven-year-old, having learned her short tasks, was dressing a doll; her
                  heart went out at once to Charlotte, she gave her a kiss, and remarked that now
                  there would be some one to see if her lessons were learned, and her hair combed
                  straight, and they could tell stories every night after they went to bed. With a
                  motherliness natural to her, Charlotte assumed much charge of the affectionate
                  Zell, and felt quite at home, especially at the table, where Zell sat on one side
                  of her, and Geoffrey on the other. The twins were in the same classes, and were
                  permitted to see each other whenever they desired. The watch-care which Charlotte
                  exercised over her brother at home was not relaxed in school.</p>
               <p>There was a confectioner's shop opposite Charlotte's window, and she observed that
                  whenever her brother went there, which was not seldom, he was accompanied by
                  several friends—friends collected about Geoffrey as flies about honey—and they all
                  came out eating. She divined that Geoffrey treated them all. It therefore behooved
                  Charlotte to save her pocket-money.</p>
               <p>She was looking from her window, one<pb n="22-23" xml:id="VAC8381-00000012"/> day,
                  counting the group leaving the cake-store, when Zell asked: "Are you going to buy
                  your blue silk apron, like the other girls, to-night?" Blue silk aprons had been
                  the rage at Walford.</p>
               <p>"No," replied Charlotte crisply; "I haven't the money."</p>
               <p>"Dear me! I'll lend you some. I've got twenty cents," said Zell.</p>
               <p>"I never borrow," said Charlotte curtly; then, seeing the child's bright face
                  shadowing, she kissed her.</p>
               <p>It was only the next day that Geoffrey came to his sister's room, saying,
                  "Charley" (he always called her Charley when he wanted something)—"O Charley, my
                  dear, can you lend me a couple of dollars? I'm cleaned out."</p>
               <p>Charlotte quietly handed him the money he asked, counting it out, and at no pains
                  to conceal that it took the last cent she had.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey saw it. "Cleans you out, too, don't it, Charley? Well, never mind, I'll
                  pay you back, certain sure." He pocketed the money securely.</p>
               <p>"There, now!" cried Zell, who stood near, for she was always on hand when Geoffrey
                  came in, "I'm afraid you told an <emph>untrue,</emph> Charlotte; you said you had
                  not the money to get a blue silk apron—like all the girls here."</p>
               <p>"There, Charley," said Geoffrey, "I hope you'll never say 'can't afford.' I never
                  do. It sounds close. Never be mean, my dear sis. And did you really go without
                  that kind of aprons they are all sporting?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, she did truly," interpolated Zell, getting before her room-mate.</p>
               <p>"That will never do," said Geoffrey; "they'll think you a pauper. I'll see that
                  you have one."</p>
               <p>In the course of a week Geoffrey came in with a yard of blue silk, and gave it to
                  his sister. Charlotte at first imagined that he had had the grace to spend some of
                  the borrowed money on it, but Geoffrey had never thought of such a thing. "I wrote
                  to mother," he said, "to send me some money to buy you an apron, as I did not like
                  to see you shabbier than the rest; so here it is, and make<pb n="24-25"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000013"/> it stylish." He also showed her the letter from his
                  mother, praising his brotherly love that was so thoughtful of his sister; and from
                  the casual mention of the amount enclosed, Charlotte could not help seeing that
                  Geoffrey had made twenty-five cents by the business.</p>
               <p>There was a great noise about the buildings, one night; the boys had suddenly
                  broken loose, and were holding high carnival. Next morning, Geoffrey was not at
                  breakfast; he was ill of headache, and Charlotte got leave to go and see him. He
                  was in bed, with his head tied up, but, seeing his sister alone, speedily pulled
                  off the kerchief, and sat up, with no other evil evident than a black eye.</p>
               <p>"I am afraid, Geof, you were one of those boys, last night," said Charlotte,
                  referring to the rioters.</p>
               <p>"Well, Charley dear," said the amiable Geoffrey, "the fellows wanted me so badly,
                  and it doesn't look well to set one's self stiffly above these little games. And
                  the fact was, Charley, the fellows did not know how to do anything exciting or
                  original. The ghost was entirely my invention, and, if you'll believe it, I am the
                  only one not caught! I may be suspected, <emph>possibly.</emph> The headache game
                  will do very well. I can so cover up my eye, which I got by running into the
                  gatepost when I was playing spectre. It was the neatest thing, Charley. I came
                  tearing upstairs with Ture at my heels, and I had off the trappings, and was at
                  the table cramming algebra (my hand over my eye) when he got in here, and, seeing
                  me so busy, thought he must be mistaken. '<emph>You</emph> here, Master Hunter?'
                  says he. 'Yes, sir, <emph>of course;</emph> isn't it rather noisy on the campus
                  to-night, sir?' says I, and off he went. All I want of you, Charley dear, is to
                  write off that translation of the sixteenth fable; I hadn't a minute to learn it
                  last night."</p>
               <p>Charlotte wrote the translation, feeling that she was doing wrong; and, with tears
                  in her eyes, pleaded, "You won't do so again, will you, Geof?"</p>
               <p>"What, going to cry, Charley? Don't—for my sake don't. I'll never do it again, as
                  sure as you're born, Charley. Got the<pb n="26-27" xml:id="VAC8381-00000014"/>
                  translation all right? Thank you—you're the best fellow in the world; worth six of
                  chum, who says <emph>I'm</emph> the best fellow. Queer idea; ain't it,
                  Charley?"</p>
               <p>"You <emph>are</emph> the best fellow!" cried Charlotte, growing tender, and
                  kissing her beautiful brother; and before she was out of the room, Geoffrey was
                  learning her translation, and deftly fitting it to the Latin.</p>
               <p>This was not the only instance of such help. Charlotte grew suspicious of the
                  phrase "Charley dear," for it usually prefaced such whispers as this, one evening
                  at the table, "To-morrow is composition-day, my blessing, and I'm short of my
                  compo; yours all right?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; why didn't you write, last evening, Geof?"</p>
               <p>"You see, Charley love, the boys beguiled me into acting charades for them. I can
                  do the professors killingly, dear, good men that they are. I must let you see me
                  do them some time. I say, Charley, you couldn't let me have your compo, could you?
                  It's Greek, this evening, and I couldn't get one done. Your report went home
                  perfect, the last two months, and I managed to get three demerits each time.
                  Father blew me up for it each time, and I've tried <emph>so</emph> hard this
                  month, and here will be another, you see—unless you come to the rescue. If you do
                  get a demerit, it will be your first, and father won't mind it. In fact, I'll tell
                  him the right of the matter some time. Nobody will know, Charley; you write a fist
                  just like mine."</p>
               <p>Charlotte ate no more supper; but, when the class met the tutor to be helped
                  through the intricacies of the Greek lesson, Charlotte quietly handed Geoffrey a
                  folded paper, and next morning he was able boldly to answer "Prepared!" in
                  composition.</p>
               <p>The school-year passed rapidly. Charlotte helped her brother bravely, secured
                  credit-marks which he could never have gained but for her, lent—or say, rather,
                     <emph>gave</emph>—him all her pocket-money, and favored him also with
                  advice.</p>
               <p>"You must not spend so much money."</p>
               <p>"Why, Charley, I spend it on other<pb n="28-29" xml:id="VAC8381-00000015"/>
                  people. I can't refuse to lend when a fellow comes to me."</p>
               <p>"You should refuse when you cannot afford it."</p>
               <p>"Nonsense, Charley dear. And when they ask me to stand treat in cakes, or pop, or
                  lemonade, I cannot say no; it would look so miserly."</p>
               <p>"You ought to say no rather than run in debt to treat other folks."</p>
               <p>Charlotte said this as a "feeler," but Geoffrey did not repudiate the idea of
                  debt; he blushed a little, and said, "How did you find that out, my dear?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Hunter, pleased with the praises received from her teachers, had sent his girl
                  five dollars to buy fineries for examination. Charlotte went first to the
                  confectioner's, and paid Geoffrey's bill of three dollars. She bought a sash with
                  the remaining money, and the next day Geoffrey came to borrow five dollars; the
                  boys had urged him to give a little supper.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Geoffrey, I have not a cent left. I'd give it to you if I had; but you
                  ought not to do these things for the boys. Father cannot afford it."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey looked so melancholy that, when Charlotte was called from the room,
                  little Zell approached him with a five-dollar bill, saying, "I'd as lief lend it
                  as not. Do take it, Geoffrey. I don't know what to do with it, and you can pay me
                  back next term." Geoffrey hesitated, but Zell pushed the money into his
                  half-willing hand, saying positively, "Take it."</p>
               <p>"You are the dearest and prettiest little girl in the world," said Geoffrey, "and
                  when I come back to school I mean to bring you a necklace."</p>
               <p>"And you are the Best Boy in the World," said Zell, speaking in capitals, and
                  blushing with delight, for she was entirely fascinated by Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>It was some days before Charlotte found out about the five dollars. She had a
                  locket given her uncle, Lawyer Ames. This locket was greatly desired by one of the
                  elder girls. To her went Charlotte. "You offered me five<pb n="30-31"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000016"/> dollars for my locket; here it is, if you will buy
                  it."</p>
               <p>The money went to Zell. "It is what Geoffrey borrowed. He thanks you, and will
                  never want to borrow any more."</p>
               <p>Children, like charity, believe all things.</p>
               <p>"How good Geoffrey is to pay so soon!" said Zell, who had already thought of a
                  dozen uses for her money.</p>
               <p>Charlotte told her brother of this restitution when they had gone home, and were
                  wandering along the green bank of the "Happy River;" she told it wishing life were
                  all a green slope by Happy River, where they two could walk safely hand in
                  hand.</p>
               <p>"Good of you to pay my debts, Charley, upon my word! And sold your locket! Well,
                  my darling, there's one comfort—you don't care for jewelry. But you
                     <emph>do</emph> care for books and pictures, my dearest Charley; and when I am
                  a lawyer, you and I will live together, and we'll have the finest library in the
                  United States."</p>
               <p>That careful mother, Mrs. Hunter, duly unpacked her children's trunks, and
                  examined all their belongings. She came downstairs after this business, and
                  remarked to her daughter, "Charlotte, I cannot imagine what you have done with
                  your money. I see nothing new in your trunk but the apron Geoffrey gave you and a
                  rose-colored sash."</p>
               <p>The past and the future did not appear very roseate to Charlotte as her mother
                  spoke. She looked up uneasily from Eva's stockings, which she was darning, and
                  said, "Oh! well, mother, the money was spent; what else was it for?"</p>
               <p>It took two pair of spectacles and a pair of unaided eyes thoroughly to review the
                  Best Fellow in the World, but the eyes alone had sufficed for the scrutiny of his
                  twin sister. Having surveyed Charlotte with the eyes, Mrs. Hunter, with motherly
                  intuitions, began to bring the glasses to bear on Geoffrey, when that youth
                  hastily remarked: "The fact is, mother, she lent it to me. I got out of funds, and
                  borrowed of her."</p>
               <p>"Boys always spend more money than girls; they need more," said Charlotte.</p>
               <pb n="32-33" xml:id="VAC8381-00000017"/>
               <p>"Son Geoffrey," remarked Mrs. Hunter, exchanging her spectacles, and regarding the
                  delightful lad through pair No. 2, "if I remember rightly, you have always been
                  borrowing of your sister since you twins could run alone; and, as far as I
                  recollect, you have never paid."</p>
               <p>"I don't want to be paid," said Charlotte, jealous for Geoffrey's reputation.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey replied, with amiable sadness, "My darling old mammy, I'm sorry if you
                  think me a bad brother to my sisters."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I don't, Geoffrey, I don't," said Mrs. Hunter, totally beguiled. "You have
                  always been the best brother in the world; so gentle and polite with them, truly,
                  my dear."</p>
               <p>At home Geoffrey told rare tales of what help he meant to be about the farm-work.
                  "Hay and harvest" came in vacation, and Geoffrey promised to perform prodigies of
                  strength and industry; but his father was forced to be content with promises. The
                  doting parents asserted that it was natural for young people just escaped from
                  school to forget to do as they had said; to lie abed late in the mornings; to make
                  visits that lasted overlong in the evening; and then Geoffrey's most thoughtless
                  acts proceeded from his excessive goodness of heart. He borrowed one of the horses
                  before breakfast to ride to town and post a love-letter for the maid; borrowed it
                  without leave, and brought it home so sweated that it could not be worked until
                  noon. The rake was idle that morning to the detriment of the hay. Geoffrey was
                  sorry, and even with tears in his eyes protested that he rode so fast for fear his
                  mother would have to keep breakfast waiting. On another occasion, he lamed the
                  best horse of the span that must be used for bringing in the hay—lamed it by
                  dashing off unbidden, for a ride of three miles, to bring his mother a
                  nutmeg-grater!</p>
               <p>Still Mr. Hunter <emph>could</emph> not be angry at these little idiosyncrasies of
                  Geoffrey—for Geoffrey could read both poetry and prose in a fashion to thrill the
                  most senseless "human" that ever listened; his impromptu speeches were supposed to
                     rival<pb n="34-35" xml:id="VAC8381-00000018"/> the early deliverances of Daniel
                  Webster; he had brought home the first prize in elocution, and led his class in
                  mathematics; more than this, the principal of the boarding-school came from
                  Walford to visit the Hunters in the vacation, and pronounced over the absent
                  Geoffrey unlimited eulogy. "He will undoubtedly be an ornament to society, and a
                  blessing to the world," said the principal. "He is decidedly the smartest pupil
                  Walford ever boasted, and we have turned out some fine scholars" (speaking quite
                  as if the seminary were a cabinet-shop, and for scholars he had said furniture).
                  "Indeed, you have cause to be proud of your children. It is hard to choose between
                  them. The boy has the greater genius, the girl the more perseverance.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hunter during these words had polished her eyes and both pair of spectacles,
                  and now remarked, "that she sometimes wished the two could be shaken up together,
                  as they obviously possessed qualities which should be combined in one shining
                  individual, but in thus shaking them up she could not tell which child she wished
                  merged in the other." Mrs. Hunter did not use exactly these words, for she was a
                  plain, unlettered woman, and we, editing these annals, have our Webster's
                  Unabridged just at hand, and are able to pick and choose at leisure. But, in
                  making her remark, Mrs. Hunter thought remorsefully that in Charlotte's conduct
                  had appeared none of those little discrepancies which we are compelled to report
                  of Geoffrey; but, then, that was only to be expected—for dear, plain Charlotte was
                  not the Best Fellow in the World. And here upon the musing mother shone between
                  the clematis that draped the window the face of Geoffrey, lit with glowing, hazel
                  eyes, and framed by masses of bronzed hair, until he was like some artist's study
                  of young Phœbus, glinted, in the old-time style, with touches of leaf-gold.</p>
               <p>Well, the vacation was over, and the twins returned to Walford. Charlotte was
                  established with Zell again, and smiled<pb n="36-37" xml:id="VAC8381-00000019"/>
                  perforce to see that small damsel's passion for Geoffrey. At table, the child paid
                  more attention to Geoffrey than to her eating; when he came to the room, she hung
                  about his chair; she hemmed him a handkerchief in curious stitches, and painfully
                  worked him a pair of slippers and a book-mark for Christmas.</p>
               <p>When Geoffrey thanked her for her gifts, called her a little dear, and said he
                  would like to have her for a sister, Zell was happy. When he brought her a tiny
                  ring set with a turquoise for a New Year's gift, she went into an ecstasy of joy.
                  When Geoffrey gave Zell her ring, he brought Charlotte a gold pencil; and here
                  turned up another discrepancy. Geoffrey had written home for money to buy these
                  gifts, and his father sent him ten dollars. Just after he got the money, it was
                  decided by a few of the boys to give, in the gymnasium, a New Year's entertainment
                  to some of the young ladies. The refreshments were to cost twenty dollars, and
                  Geoffrey, as became a royal good fellow, gave half the money. After this he went
                  in debt for his presents; and in a few weeks Charlotte, discovering the debt,
                  began to save up her allowance, and by a queer coincidence paid, on the first of
                  April, for her own and her room-mate's New Year's presents.</p>
               <p>But we must go back to the supper. Zell cried because she was too small to be
                  invited, but Charlotte was old enough, and went. Without the knowledge of the
                  faculty, these jolly lads had smuggled in some wine. Do not stare at wine in a
                  twenty-dollar supper for ten; because, in days when champagne and burgundy can be
                  made of <emph>dried apples</emph> (and the apples be duly dried again and sold for
                  pies, after they have yielded the best imported wine), wine is cheap. Boys and
                  girls thought it very cunning and sharp when the bottles came out of hiding, and
                  the perils of the smuggling were gaily narrated, and all were ready for merry sips
                  and healths. All? Well, hardly Charlotte. She had never thought on<pb n="38-39"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000020"/> the wine question. The subject had never been
                  brought home to her. Love is a magician. Rather, love is divine, and can prophesy.
                  The love of Charlotte for her twin-brother was greater than the loves of David and
                  Jonathan. When she saw the wine, she quickly began to think not how it affected
                  herself, but how it would affect Geoffrey. The walls of the gymnasium melted away,
                  and the room widened to the world; her grouped companions changed to earth's
                  toilers and conquerors, and the dusty bottles to a band of foes by whom beloved
                  Geoffrey was worsted in the strife. The wine gurgled into the glasses, and she saw
                  the Happy River run singing as it went; and it swept on, and deepened and
                  broadened into a strange, dark pool, over which hemlock and cypress, and deathly
                  parasites, and poison-ivy hung, and down beneath the shiny, stagnant waters
                  slipped Geoffrey's glorytinted hair. The voices and faces near were known
                  again—the room narrowed to its due limits—the walls rose straight and strong.</p>
               <p>"We'll drink the New Year, Charlotte," said Geoffrey's joyous tones.</p>
               <p>"No, Geoffrey," replied Charlotte with unwonted fervor. "My Geoffrey, I cannot, I
                  cannot see you taste one single drop. For my sake, Geoffrey, put it down!"</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>Fred Gay, one of the party standing near, moved by her tone, would have set down
                  his glass, but Geoffrey spoke:</p>
               <pb n="40-41" xml:id="VAC8381-00000021"/>
               <p>"What! be so stiff and moping, and hurt their feelings all for NOTHING, Charley my
                  dear?"</p>
               <p>"O Geoffrey! for my sake, never a single drop!"</p>
               <p>"Charley my dear, I'll split the difference with you; now for <emph>their</emph>
                  sakes I'll drink, and for your sake never again." He tossed off the health, but
                  Charlotte did not taste a drop.</p>
               <p>Now after this, our genial boy, when in his school-life pressed to take a glass of
                  wine, took it secretly—for Charlotte's sake—and banished the odor from his breath
                  with a comfit first invented by the devil.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
               <p>OUR Geoffrey only indulged in wine, with the after-thoughts of comfits highly
                  perfumed, when it was needful for him thus to maintain his position as the Best
                  Fellow extant. There are some truly commendable people who go to church when it
                  neither rains nor snows, is not too hot or too cold or too dusty, and when they
                  have some new clothes to show. There are other lively and accommodating sinners
                  who lie when it will serve themselves, their neighbors, or the devil. Thus
                  Geoffrey gracefully looked upon the wine when it was red, and just as gracefully
                  tossed it down his throat, when it would please the vender, the buyer, the friend
                  who invited him, or would save him from seeming to set himself upon some lofty
                  eminence of virtue above the fellowship of other mortals.</p>
               <p>We must, indeed, chronicle one occasion<pb n="42-43" xml:id="VAC8381-00000022"/>
                  when our admirable young friend was invited to the library, and severely
                  reprimanded for having been seen, against orders, in a bar-room. But even this
                  turned to his advantage, for his penitence was so deep, his apologies were so
                  fluent, that the severe "Prex" relapsed from his severity, shook hands with the
                  culprit, and liked him better than ever.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey was at last ready to go to college. Charlotte announced that she was
                  ready also, and, in fact, whatever fitness could be claimed by Geoffrey was
                  possessed also by his sister.</p>
               <p>Father, mother, and Eva came to the Walford examination and exhibition; father
                  with stout clothes and even stouter pocket-book, genially smiling on all he met;
                  mother rustic and simple, in a bonnet of date two years back, and dress and cape
                  guiltless of furbelows and ruffles, yet with such motherly kindness and
                  benevolence radiating from face and silver-rimmed spectacles as made every one
                  pronounce her "such a nice old lady;" lastly, Eva was a bundle of curls and
                  muslins, with bits of smiles and fluttering ribbons, and all the Walford boys
                  followed her with adoring eyes. Behind the spectacles and the homespun there was
                  in Mrs. Hunter a deal of acuteness—she could learn something from experience, and
                  the experience of two years had taught her so much that she brought Geoffrey's
                  graduating suit from home that she might feel sure it was paid for; she brought
                  Charlotte's dress also, lest, were money for it sent, the money might pay little
                  debts Charlotte had never contracted, and the girl be shabby on the great
                  occasion. This same acuteness caused Mrs. Hunter to ask her husband to go about to
                  the stores in town to see if there were any bills against "our Geoffrey."</p>
               <p>The bills amounted to fifty dollars. There was no time to think of these small
                  errors now, for the examination was in progress, and a certain pair of twins, who
                  were alike in nothing but their preeminence, led the school, carried off all<pb
                     n="44-45" xml:id="VAC8381-00000023"/> the honors, and made the hearts of those
                  honest parents from the country sing for joy.</p>
               <p>Happy father and mother! They heard the mellow tones they had first trained to
                  articulate speech utter now a sounding Latin salutatory, of which they could not
                  understand one word; but it was all the grander for that, and everybody said it
                  was quite wonderful for a lad of sixteen, even considering that the good "Prex"
                  had brushed it up and helped him on.</p>
               <p>This same salutatory was an unusual feather in the cap of Walford seminary, and by
                  that and Charlotte's valedictory the soul of the "Prex" was comforted, even when
                  he found that some of his boys were celebrating their last evening at Walford by
                  "Tom and Jerry" and Roman punch. While Geoffrey helped them to celebrate,
                  Charlotte comforted Zell, who grieved over the approaching parting, and the
                  parents in their room at the hotel made mention of that fifty dollars.</p>
               <p>"This must come to an end. It is very wrong, and I shall tell him so," said Mr.
                  Hunter.</p>
               <p>"Yes, to be sure; and yet, father, I dare say you'll find that the dear boy has
                  not spent it on himself, but on his friends. He always had the best heart."</p>
               <p>"I know I can't stand treat and supply pocket-money for all his friends," said Mr.
                  Hunter, sore over the demands thus unexpectedly made on him.</p>
               <p>"For my part," pertly spoke up Eva, with the wisdom of twelve, "I like to see boys
                  lively. They <emph>must</emph> be a little wild and see life. I always read so in
                  story-books. And fifty dollars isn't much, is it?"</p>
               <p>"Be silent, child; it would clothe me for a year," said her father sharply.</p>
               <p>"Well, father," said Mrs. Hunter soothingly, "don't worry. I am sure a boy who can
                  talk Latin as beautifully as our Geoffrey cannot be very far wrong."</p>
               <p>"I dare say Charlotte could speak it as well, and <emph>she</emph> don't owe a
                  penny," said Mr. Hunter grimly.</p>
               <pb n="46-47" xml:id="VAC8381-00000024"/>
               <p>"Ah! yes; but Charlotte is a girl, and Geoffrey was always such a good fellow,"
                  replied the mother.</p>
               <p>"Let me tell you what one of the professors said, to-day," cried Eva. "He said
                  your children were Wit, Beauty, and Good-sense. Geof is Wit, and Lottie is
                  Good-sense. I can't possibly guess who Beauty is, can you?" And Eva laughed
                  merrily.</p>
               <p>"Go to bed, child. I'm afraid you're vain," said her mother.</p>
               <p>Early next morning, Mr. Hunter was talking to his son: "I really cannot understand
                  these debts, Geof."</p>
               <p>"Now, my good father, you surely cannot think they were for myself! I lent some
                  money to the fellows, foolish of course, but how could I refuse them? And I had to
                  treat them now and then; and I gave Prex a Bible as a testimonial, and his wife a
                  gold thimble; and really, I could not stand seeing Charlotte without a reticule,
                  and a card-case, and a fashionable muff and parasol. The dressing-case and
                  writing-desk were for me. I hope you liked my salutatory, father? And didn't
                  Charley gave a stunning valedictory? I meant to tell you about these little bills,
                  and I mean to pay you, too. When this examination is over, I mean to go home and
                  work faithfully as a hand, and pay you up. I beg your pardon, my good, liberal
                  father, if I've disappointed your expectations or hurt your feelings."</p>
               <p>What could this parent say but that he was neither disappointed nor vexed, and was
                  exceedingly proud of his admirable son and his admirable salutatory?</p>
               <p>The examination to which Geoffrey referred was at college. The principal of
                  Walford was going to take a class of six young men—idle Fred Gay most poorly
                  prepared, but our Geoffrey chief ornament among them—to enter them at their chosen
                  college.</p>
               <p>Mr. and Mrs. Hunter had supposed that Charlotte was going home with them, until at
                  the depot she announced her intention of accompanying her brother. "I am going to
                  college, you know. I always said so."</p>
               <p>"If you can get there," said her father,<pb n="48-49" xml:id="VAC8381-00000025"/>
                  laughing. "Well, go with Geoffrey, if the principal will take you."</p>
               <p>So Charlotte picked up her compact black satchel, and went with her brother. The
                  principal laughed, and permitted Charlotte to do as she chose, to see whereunto
                  this thing would grow.</p>
               <p>Charlotte was not the only lady who waited upon the college faculty, for one or
                  two widowed mothers appeared with their young sons to watch their success and
                  provide for their future. Charlotte's errand was unlike theirs.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said the undaunted young woman, "I have always been my brother's classmate,
                  and am as well prepared as he is. I wish to stand my examination and enter
                  college."</p>
               <p>"O my dear child! impossible!" cried the venerable president, glancing at the
                  firm, well-made figure from the round hat to the neat boots. Plainly dressed in
                  black, grave and self-possessed, Charlotte was a most impressive damsel, but many
                  years before her age. Charlotte secretly thought herself a much more suitable
                  candidate for collegiate honors than Fred Gay.</p>
               <p>"Sir, if I pay my bills, and keep up with my class, why cannot I enter college?"
                  asked Charlotte.</p>
               <p>"Because such a proceeding would be without precedent, and against the rules."</p>
               <p>"Then you can do me a favor, sir, if you will?"</p>
               <p>"Anything in reason, my dear young lady."</p>
               <p>"You can speak to the pastor here in town to allow me to board in his family, and
                  he will superintend my studies while I keep up with my brother in his classes. My
                  father will pay whatever he asks."</p>
               <p>"I will do this with pleasure, my child."</p>
               <p>"Might I not attend lectures in the college, if I did not recite?" asked
                  Charlotte, emboldened.</p>
               <p>"Oh! no," cried the president, alarmed again. "All the young men would stare at
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Sir," returned Charlotte frostily, "I believe young men never stare at a young
                  woman who does not encourage it."</p>
               <pb n="50-51" xml:id="VAC8381-00000026"/>
               <p>The president first wished this imperturbable maid were his daughter; next wished
                  he might admit her to college; then arranged matters for her with the minister,
                  and promised to oversee her studies himself now and then, if she persevered.
                  However much he was taken with Charlotte, he was even more captivated by her
                  brother, and foresaw that he would lead his class.</p>
               <p>After this, these two went home to the dear old farm, and Geoffrey was so occupied
                  in being delightful, and helping and pleasing all the world, that he forgot to
                  work out that little indebtedness to his father, and his father forgot it too.
                  While both were thus ignoring the promise and its fulfilment, Geoffrey was roaming
                  about, making calls, chatting with every one he met, treating the boys, and
                  flattering the little girls of the district-school, and making friends
                  everywhere.</p>
               <p>"It is all in my line, Charley," he would say, when his sister hinted that he
                  might possibly be wasting his valuable time. "If I am to be a successful lawyer, I
                  want to be a politician, and the politician must know how to win hearts and be
                  universally agreeable."</p>
               <p>Sitting on the edge of the rock basin of Cold Spring, watching the Happy River
                  dancing on its way, and thinking of some suitable form with which to persuade his
                  mother to make cherry bounce, wherewith he might "respectably" treat his friends
                  when they called, Geoffrey heard a step, and, looking up, saw a tall,
                  loose-jointed man, with a rifle in one hand and a leather drinking-cup in the
                  other. With his usual geniality, Geoffrey rose, shook hands, and gave the stranger
                  a seat; then filled the leathern drinking-vessel, and asked after his success in
                  hunting. The man's game was in a net-bag, and consisted entirely of small birds.
                  He took out a Baltimore oriole, and lovingly stroked the brilliant plumage as he
                  held it toward Geoffrey, then laid it on his knee, and took from the bag a cedar
                  bird of rare beauty.</p>
               <p>"I never had one so handsome before," he said; "for, if you'll notice, there is a
                  second row of red spots hanging below the yellow dots on the edge of the wings and
                  tail."</p>
               <pb n="52-53" xml:id="VAC8381-00000027"/>
               <p>The bird was beautiful in form and of a delicate brown hue, except the gay spots
                  which the hunter so much admired.</p>
               <p>"How could you kill it?" asked Geoffrey, who loved every living thing.</p>
               <p>The man smiled, and, still stroking the bird tenderly, replied: "One gets hardened
                  to their business, sir. I make my living and Katy's by these birds. I stuff them,
                  and send them to England. I've sent several hundreds, sir. My name is Moreland,
                  and, if you could call at my house, I could show you some fine specimens of
                  animals and birds well stuffed; and Katy could give you a good glass of ale or
                  beer. She keeps a few barrels and some tobacco to sell to the neighbors, sir; for,
                  having no children, she's main lonesome when I'm away hunting my birds. And when
                  I'm home, what with working at the skins, and holding the tools in my mouth, and
                  searching my books for names, I'm not very companionable, though Katy
                     <emph>does</emph> say it's a pleasure to look at me."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey, ready to make friends with everybody, interested by the stranger's words
                  and pursuits, and curious to see "Katy," took the hunter home to dinner, and in a
                  day or two walked over to pay him a visit.</p>
               <p>Moreland's house was easily to be found, as TAXIDERMIST was written in large
                  letters on a sign, while more modestly under it hung the too familiar legend ALE
                  AND BEER. The hamlet was a poor one near the mouth of a mine; but Katy found
                  plenty of her neighbors ready to pay out some of their coppers, hardly earned in
                  the depths of the earth, for foaming cups of something which, she assured them,
                  had each the strength of a loaf of bread.</p>
               <p>"It's a respectable place," said comely Katy to her guest. "I allow no guzzling
                  nor rowdying about me. If you would do me the honor to sit in the best chair and
                  take a glass of ale while you look at the birds, I would take it kindly, sir.
                  Moreland's a rare hand; do just look about you!"</p>
               <p>Katy had a pleasant voice and a pleasant smile—a tidy, comfortable matron, with an
                  intense pride in her <emph>taxidermist.</emph> Geoffrey felt that he could not
                  refuse her the honor<pb n="54-55" xml:id="VAC8381-00000028"/> she asked; he
                     <emph>could not</emph> hold himself stiffly above these people. He sat down,
                  and drank a glass or two of Katy's <emph>best</emph> while he looked around. The
                  brown beams of the low room were ornamented with coon, squirrel, and rabbit skins
                  stretched out to dry. The walls were papered with illustrated weeklies,
                  advertisements, and sixpenny prints. The hunter's rifles were slung over the
                  mantel; some large volumes of natural history were on a shelf; along the sides of
                  the room were ranged cases of stuffed birds and small animals, and sheets of
                  Bristol-board covered with beetles, butterflies, and moths. Katy's ale and beer
                  barrels occupied one side of the room, and the mugs and glasses were on a blue
                  dresser. As it was summer, the fire-place was filled with green branches and wild
                  flowers, while the wooden settles were put outside the door. The room was rather
                  dusty, but Katy said "Moreland" did not like her to sweep much, it hurt the
                  "speciments."</p>
               <p>While Geoffrey sipped the ale and looked about, an elderly man came in with
                  several "friends." He was a man who had the making of a patriarch in him, in a
                  full beard, a head turning bald, a round, smiling face, and a mellow voice. He
                  treated all the friends who came with him, complimented Mrs. Moreland and the
                  beer, drank "the health of the strange gentleman kindly present," and, when his
                  comrades were gone, took a great measure of ale to one of the settles outside, and
                  deliberately set himself to guzzling.</p>
               <p>"And who is that?" asked Geoffrey softly of the communicative Mrs. Moreland.</p>
               <p>"Oh! that's Uncle Terry—a good fellow, real good, and no one's enemy but his own.
                  He mines when he is not running around, chatting, drinking, or helping his
                  neighbors. And such a hand to treat, as if he were a king! Not a mite of harm in
                  him; but I often tell him not to frequent here so, for he uses up his money
                  without thinking, and has none for them at home, and his wife's weakly, and his
                  daughter's husband was killed in the mine, and she with a babe not a month old.
                  Poor little Judy! I'm making her a slip this<pb n="56-57"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000029"/> minute; and by that token, I've a little nephew
                  turned six is coming over to us from London. Yes, there's no harm in Terry but his
                  goodness, and sometimes he is too good for his own good or those belonging to
                  him."</p>
               <p>No misgiving came over the heart of the Best Fellow in the World as, seated in
                  Mrs. Moreland's big chair emptying a mug of ale, he saw and heard of the other
                  excellent good fellow. Having heard, he gave Mrs. Moreland a dollar to buy baby
                  Judy two more slips, and, shaking hands with Uncle Terry, went joyously home to
                  tell Charlotte what he had seen. Going, he left a memory behind him like sunshine,
                  and Mrs. Moreland wondering if that princely mannered lad would ever come again.
                  She need not have wondered; in other years and other circumstances he came, and
                  came again, all things changing, the Best Fellow and the Good Fellow, everything
                  changing but Katy's rough cottage under the gray side of the beetling cliff.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey gave such a glowing account of his visit that, the first evening a pair
                  of horses could be spared, Charlotte rode with her brother to call on Mrs.
                  Moreland and see her curiosities. After the call was finished and the visitors
                  were galloping away:</p>
               <p>"I don't often take a fancy to any one," said Katy, greatly belying herself; "but
                  I'd do pretty near anything for that young lady."</p>
               <p>There was no second call made to the taxidermist's that season, for Charlotte and
                  Geoffrey soon went off to college—Geoffrey with many gentle warnings not to exceed
                  the allowance his father was able to make him.</p>
               <p>The twins were gone—the house was lonely without the helpful girl and the
                  brilliant young man.</p>
               <p>In their new home, the pair were objects of unusual interest. The sister was
                  content to shine like a fixed star steadily in her appointed space; the brother,
                  comet-like, must be discursive in his genius and an object of astonishment. Being
                  a freshman, of course he was convinced that he knew everything, and, for a wonder,
                  his professors esteemed<pb n="58-59" xml:id="VAC8381-00000030"/> him almost as
                  highly as he did himself. We travesty what is written of Washington, and can
                  assert that Master Geoffrey was first in the class-room, first in frolic, and
                  first in the hearts of the faculty. If he got into little scrapes easily, he got
                  out of them gracefully. That his frolics led to extravagance was reprehensible;
                  that they digressed into drinking wine or brandy now and then was alarming. But
                  Charlotte was a good genius to keep him from great errors; and partly for his sake
                  and partly for the sake of that brave loving girl-student, the faculty winked at
                  all Geoffrey's errors. Fred Gay, trying to carry the same sail under which
                  Geoffrey ran so easily, came a score of times near ship-wrecked.</p>
               <p>Do not think we are going to write that Geoffrey forgot and neglected his sister.
                  He loved her fondly. The moment chapel exercises ended in the morning, he ran
                  across the campus and over the street to the parsonage to ask for his sister. When
                  the mail came in, he never failed to go to Charlotte to report and share the
                  letters. On Sunday evening, he invariably accompanied her to church. When flowers
                  were in season, he kept her supplied with bouquets. They frequently studied
                  together; she read his essays and heard his orations before any one else, and
                  doubtless they were often improved by her criticisms. When some wise professor
                  commended Geoffrey's talent in composition, our young man was neither afraid nor
                  ashamed to say: "Oh! but you should hear Charley, sir; she beats me all
                  hollow!"</p>
               <p>There is no doubt that it was this gallant bearing toward his sister that helped
                  keep Geoffrey so high in the good graces of the college faculty. It certainly won
                  for him the partisanship of all the professors' wives and sisters, and that, we
                  know, is worth a great deal.</p>
               <p>The old story of Charlotte's saving and Geoffrey's lavishing was told again at
                  college. Charlotte was an orderly creature, whose clothes would never wear out,
                  and who had a great genius for making new out of old, and looking well in
                  anything. She<pb n="60-61" xml:id="VAC8381-00000031"/> clung to neat gloves and
                  boots and immaculate collars and cuffs, but she wore no gewgaws and no fineries,
                  and, when Geoffrey urged her to adopt them "for fashion's sake," he was always
                  compelled to admit that she looked better without them.</p>
               <p>The last term of the freshman year Geoffrey was shocked to discover that Charlotte
                  was teaching writing in the "Young Ladies' School" in the town.</p>
               <p>"Why not?" asked Charlotte coolly. "I have time, and as good a right to earn money
                  as a young man. If it is no disgrace to one of your students to teach, it is no
                  disgrace to me. I can do it well."</p>
               <p>"It's a fact, Charley, you do write a splendid fist, and, when we go into law
                  together, you shall do the writing, and then there'll be one law office that turns
                  out good penmanship."</p>
               <p>Perhaps Geoffrey was more reconciled to this teaching when, just before vacation,
                  Charlotte handed him his bill for indebtedness at the livery stable, duly
                  receipted. He guessed then which way her earnings had gone; he wrung her hand,
                  while tears stood in his eyes.</p>
               <p>"You sha'n't lose by this, Charley my dear, I assure you. I'm bound to make a high
                  mark, and you shall go up with me. Oh! upon my word, Charley, I'll put you in the
                  White House yet, and make you the greatest lady of them all. Bless you, you're the
                  best friend ever a fellow had!"</p>
               <p>After this effusion, of course Charlotte felt that she had done nothing worth
                  speaking of, and was more than amply rewarded.</p>
               <p>At home Geoffrey helped vigorously some days, and hindered just as completely on
                  others, all out of goodness and forgetfulness. He wrote several poems that were
                  published in the village paper, and sent a story and an essay to a magazine, which
                  were accepted with <emph>thanks</emph>—the only kind of coin said magazine dealt
                  in. He also read of evenings to his parents, and Eva doted on hearing the "Culprit
                  Fay;" while his mother graphically remarked that his rendering of the "Ancient
                  Mariner" "absolutely made her crawl to hear him." On some evenings, also,<pb
                     n="62-63" xml:id="VAC8381-00000032"/> Charlotte and Geoffrey jointly gave
                  scenes from Shakespeare, which their father asserted to be worth ten dollars a
                  hearing. Aside from thus assisting Geoffrey with Shakespeare, Charlotte taught Eva
                  French and botany. Charlotte had never studied music, as she had sense to perceive
                  her lack of talent for it. She agreed with her mother that it would be well to get
                  a piano by-and-by and have Eva instructed, as she seemed to have little talent for
                  anything else.</p>
               <p>"Eva hates study; so I would not send her to boarding-school," said the wise
                  Charlotte. "I can teach her all she is willing to learn. But, mother, get her the
                  piano pretty soon, before father thinks he cannot afford it."</p>
               <p>Charlotte being at college, her word was law, and her mother made arrangements to
                  get the piano.</p>
               <p>"Mother," said Geoffrey, "do make wine out of some of the fruit. One can't keep
                  Christmas and New Year's without wine, and Charley and I are coming home for the
                  winter holidays and want a party. Always keep some wine, mother, to offer to your
                  guests with cake in good style. That, now, would be real hospitality."</p>
               <p>"Yes, do, mother," said Eva; "that is the way they do in story-books. Do make wine
                  for Geoffrey, mother."</p>
               <p>"And I say, mammy darling, you'll let us have some egg-nog for our company
                  to-night, won't you? I mentioned the matter to the hens, and they volunteered an
                  extra egg apiece, and the recipe is in the cook-book. You'll have it for us, won't
                  you? and I'll read for you."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hunter was knitting. She had one pair of specs on her forehead, and one up
                  over her cap border. She dropped the first pair to view Eva, the upper pair to
                  look at Geoffrey; and finding her foolish maternal heart softening to that
                  beguiling boy's unprecedented petition, put the two pair of spectacles together
                  over her eyes, and regarded him severely through double glasses. Under this
                  arrangement of lenses Geoffrey looked less enchanting, and she was enabled to
                  say:</p>
               <pb n="64-65" xml:id="VAC8381-00000033"/>
               <p>"No, Geoffrey; you know, I'll have no such doings here."</p>
               <p>In spite of these <emph>noes,</emph> in the evening, when youthful fun was at its
                  height, that naughty Geoffrey appeared with a great tureen of something, and Eva
                  bringing glasses.</p>
               <p>"What is that, Geoffrey?" demanded the mother, filled with an alarming
                  suspicion.</p>
               <p>"Oh! it's floating island, mother dear, I guess."</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey, <emph>I</emph> guess it is that wicked egg-nog."</p>
               <p>"Oh! go off, mammy," said the laughing Geoffrey, giving her fat shoulder a poke.
                  "It <emph>is</emph> floating island—with something else under it. Hand over the
                  glasses, Eva pet."</p>
               <p>Charlotte's sparkling face darkened, as when a thunder-gust rushes over a summer
                  sky. Mrs. Hunter went out to her maid.</p>
               <p>"Ann! why did you help Geoffrey to make that—stuff?"</p>
               <p>"Troth; ma'am," said the smiling Ann, tying on a new neck-ribbon, "it's not me
                  fault at all, at all. Sure, one couldn't help givin' him the eyes out of their
                  head, if he axed 'em so persuadin'-like, even whin they knew well they'd nade thim
                  the nixt minute!"</p>
               <p>So we perceive that this was a very <figure/> beguiling and dangerous young man to
                  be around; and it is quite reasonable that mother Hunter should sit down by the
                  window in her own favorite room, and consider whatever was to be done with her<pb
                     n="66-67" xml:id="VAC8381-00000034"/> beautiful son, and feel oppressed with
                  the fact that a son "too good" was as trouble-some as one "too bad." We use the
                  word <emph>good</emph> in the sense in which it applied to Uncle Terry and our
                  Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>Again at college, and while Geoffrey pursued his studies with ardor, took a high
                  rank in his classes—especially devoted himself to elocution, and wrote many
                  things, some good and some indifferent, as usually happens—his sister kept abreast
                  with him in her studies, and by degrees taught more and more.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey protested half-heartedly against this teaching. He could see no harm in
                  it, and protests were ever useless when Charlotte had made up her mind; besides,
                  the fact that Charlotte was relieving her father of expense comforted Geoffrey in
                  view of some little indiscretions on his own part. Indeed, before the senior year
                  was reached, Charlotte not only provided all the money she used, but was able to
                  lend her brother various small sums, which, he assured both her and himself,
                  should be repaid with interest.</p>
               <p>"Charley, what a treasure you are! But for you I should be disheartened" (though
                  what there was for Geoffrey to grow disheartened over was more than anybody could
                  tell).</p>
               <p>Geoffrey took the "five" his sister was lending him, tucked it into his pocket,
                  and said:</p>
               <p>"Never fear, my dear Charley. Love and gratitude keep your account in my mind, and
                  I shall pay you not ten percent., but ten times over."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey was ever abundant in promises, and, though these are not legal tender,
                  his sister readily accepted them and set them to his credit. Now, gently putting
                  aside both thanks and promises, she said boldly:</p>
               <p>"Geof, I wouldn't have the slightest hesitation in lending you; in fact, it would
                  be a pleasure, if I felt sure you never paid out any of your money at the
                  bar."</p>
               <p>"Charley, my best! what a naughty accusation! As if I ever could forget the
                  respect due my friends, myself, my position! Now, my good Charley, you know I
                     never<pb n="68-69" xml:id="VAC8381-00000035"/> take a glass but for decency's
                  sake, when I can gratify some one else without harming myself."</p>
               <p>"Without harming yourself?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear; and I might say it is a positive benefit. A neat glass of brandy
                  has, I observe, upon me as beneficial an effect as Jonathan's honey. When I have
                  'tasted it, my eyes are enlightened.' Fact is, Charley, a small tip is as a
                  draught from the Pierian spring. That speech the fellows cheered so last week,
                  when our society was open for visitors, was made under just such inspiration. You
                  remember, Charley, you praised it yourself as I took you home."</p>
               <p>"I remember. I shall always hate that speech, now," said Charlotte with some
                  bitterness. "Come, Geof, let us go over our Greek."</p>
               <p>We do not intend to follow Geoffrey year by year until the day when he graduated
                  with the highest honors, and when the president confidentially remarked to some of
                  his friends that, if there was any young person whose attainments would enable him
                  to dispute those honors with Geoffrey, it was the reserved, calm-faced girl who
                  lived and studied at the parsonage. Let no one imagine that, in the years before
                  this commencement-day, Geoffrey had at all degenerated into the rowdy and the
                  tippler. By no means; on that day he stood higher in all esteem than ever
                  before.</p>
               <p>We pause to chronicle one experience—one grand hour when Evangelist met Geoffrey,
                  and pointed him to the Wicket-gate that stands at the head of the way where walk
                  the children of the King. Truth was, that many supposed Geoffrey had gone in at
                  the gate, and was walking with the sons of light. There is a way that runs very
                  near the way to heaven: it is trodden by the <emph>almost saved.</emph>
               </p>
               <p>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and the Heavenly Breath stirred through the
                  earthly garden of our Lord. "Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south, blow upon
                  my garden, that the spices may flow out." And, at the call of mercy, the
                  Comforting Spirit came.</p>
               <pb n="70-71" xml:id="VAC8381-00000036"/>
               <p>Now, we have no thought of irreverence in the statement that Geoffrey treated the
                  striving Spirit with the same complacency which it was his nature everywhere to
                  exhibit. Geoffrey was no mocker; he made no inane flings at that which was above
                  his comprehension. He could not scoff and doubt at religion, for his parents, his
                  friends, the professors, and the pastors to whom he listened with habitual
                  respect, were Christians, and he believed in them. When we say that father and
                  mother Hunter were Christians, we feel that an explanation is needed. They were
                  ignorant Christians. We do not say ignorant because they were unschooled in
                  classics and sciences, but because they had failed to search into and receive
                  those truths and promises of God which are open to all his people. They had read,
                  "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved." They neglected, as
                  people generally do, to receive the latter clause of this promise, "<emph>and thy
                     house.</emph>" They received the words, "The promise is unto you." They did not
                  go as far as the Eternal Father, when he immediately adds, "<emph>and to your
                     children.</emph>" They had asked God to be <emph>their</emph> God; had heard
                  him say, "I will be a God to thee," but never realized his glorious conclusion,
                     "<emph>and to thy seed after thee.</emph>" The paternal Hunters received a
                  Saviour for themselves, and calmly hoped that their children would one day do as
                  much. They limited God, in that they did not see him as the God of the
                     <emph>household,</emph> to whom they were privileged to give their children
                  without the shadow of a doubt. It is a religious <emph>selfishness</emph> terribly
                  common, and has through all ages been the cause of the cry, "O Absalom, my son, my
                  son!"</p>
               <p>When deep solemnity pervaded all the college, Geoffrey, ever complaisant to
                  popular emotions, was solemn too. When invited to meetings of prayer and
                  conference, he, who never denied a request, most amiably came. When loving friends
                  urged the claims of God, he assented; when teachers wept with strong emotion,
                  Geoffrey was not ashamed to weep. When the promise was asked that he should choose
                  God for his<pb n="72-73" xml:id="VAC8381-00000037"/> portion, that promise was
                  readily accorded. When Hector Gray, his room-mate, chose God for his portion,
                  Geoffrey seemed almost to do the same. There were in the amiable Geoffrey signs of
                  grace that were lacking in some in whom real grace was indwelling. The faculty,
                  anxious for their favorite, made their hopes parent to their belief, and they
                  accounted Geoffrey among God's trophies in that blessed time. They may have been
                  led the more readily to make this estimate of Geoffrey because, as we have shown,
                  the twins were never separated, and Charlotte had, with characteristic
                  whole-heartedness, turned her earnest face toward the city which hath
                  foundations.</p>
               <p>Early in the junior year, Geoffrey had said to Charlotte that he believed it best
                  now to spend his vacations in making some preparations for his future profession.
                  About forty miles from the college was the pleasant city where Judge Ames,
                  half-brother of Mrs. Hunter, was a prominent lawyer. With him Geoffrey meant to
                  study his profession.</p>
               <p>Charlotte gave a sigh, as she thought that now the glad returns home for long
                  visits, happy hours spent in teaching Eva, pleasant evening readings to her
                  admiring father, loving help to her mother, were for ever ended. She naturally
                  sighed as she relinquished all these joys, and turned her back on the loving
                  shelter of home, with its pressing and petting, to fight the rough battle with the
                  world by Geoffrey's side. Sighing, she did not yield her purpose. She was not
                  needed at home. The healthful, busy mother dreaded nothing more than any
                  interference in her housewifely duties. Eva, ever a soft, pretty home-bird, was
                  enough there for society and filial duties; the strong-eyed father must read his
                  paper for himself, and Eva must go her ways alone; Charlotte and Geoffrey, as
                  since their cradle, must be side by side.</p>
               <p>As in all her life, Charlotte conquered by resolution. However aghast Uncle Ames
                  was when he read, in Charlotte's bold, firm hand, "Geof and I are coming to study
                  our profession with you," he offered no objection,<pb n="74-75"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000038"/> and thereafter, in the still office, the brother
                  and sister studied together the dusty tomes that unfold the law, and learned the
                  devious manifestations of legal justice.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
               <p>IN saying that life in the old home for Charlotte was for ever ended, we do not
                  suggest that she went home no more, but that she went as a guest and for a short
                  stay.</p>
               <p>On that great occasion when Geoffrey stood forth as the valedictorian of his class
                  and won universal applause, mother Hunter, in a new silk gown, went to admire her
                  son, and father Hunter, though he wore two pair of spectacles less than his wife,
                  saw all that was going on—saw, and was briefly happy. Eva was divided between her
                  own admiration of her brother and the other students' admiration of herself. As
                  Charlotte had seen the other students daily for the last four years, it was
                  evident that she should care less about them than did Eva. Charlotte's thoughts
                  and looks had but one object—Geoffrey. Why not? Toward this one day she had
                  pressed with Geoffrey for<pb n="76-77" xml:id="VAC8381-00000039"/> four long
                  years. With Geoffrey she had bent in anxious inspection over every sentence of
                  that carefully elaborated valedictory. To descend to minor matters, she had sewed
                  every stitch in Geoffrey's shirt, hemmed his handkerchief, ironed his collar, and
                  bought his studs and watch-chain. No wonder that, regarding Geoffrey's personality
                  as her twin, and his apparel in a great measure as the work of her hands,
                  Charlotte's feelings centred alone in him.</p>
               <p>Fred Gay had no honors, but he managed to ride through his course and obtain a
                  diploma by means of a fine stud of <emph>ponies</emph>—Greek, Latin, and
                  Mathematical.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey and Charlotte went home with their parents after that famous
                  commencement-day, and that home seemed pleasanter than ever before. Eva was a
                  belle in her neighborhood, and youthful guests made the house merry. There were
                  walks, picnics, parties, and rides. Geoffrey and his sisters visited every old
                  familiar haunt. They found green vines twisted and spreading over the rock cup of
                  Cold Spring and the birds dipping down to drink, and under the white-armed
                  buttonwood-trees, with their swinging balls, the Happy River flowed singing as
                  before; while for old times' sake the twins printed their hands and feet in white
                  sand-bars that reached into the stream, and drank the clear water from purple
                  muscle-shells.</p>
               <p>One of their excursions was to visit Mrs. Moreland. The hunter was away exploring
                  Western Virginia for birds. The ale and beer barrels were in their places, the
                  mugs and glasses on the dresser, the branches and wild flowers in the open
                  chimney, and Katy was as cheery as ever.</p>
               <p>"You'll sit down, sir and ma'am; and look at his fine new birds, and the little
                  grebe he has stuffed—queer, pretty thing it is. And you'll have a drink of ale
                  this warm day."</p>
               <p>"Thank you," said Charlotte, sitting down; "we came to see how you were, and what
                  new birds you had. But we are not thirsty. No ale, if you please."</p>
               <p>Katy looked disappointed, and Geoffrey was quick to see it.</p>
               <pb n="78-79" xml:id="VAC8381-00000040"/>
               <p>"We are not thirsty," he said. "But you may give me a glass of ale, Mrs. Moreland.
                  I'll take it as a compliment to you."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moreland drew the ale with alacrity, while Charlotte looked on
                  ill-pleased.</p>
               <p>"How is Uncle Terry?" asked Geoffrey, who never forgot any one.</p>
               <p>"Just the same, sir. May be a bit balder and grayer, sir; and works less and
                  drinks more. Cheerful and good-hearted, that one <emph>cannot</emph> be angry at
                  him, though he does neglect the family, and they have hard times. I'd refuse the
                  pay for the ale he drinks, if I thought <emph>they'd</emph> get the money. But no;
                  he'd tip the first little rapscallion he met with the threepence, and think it so
                  much clear gain. Such a good heart has poor Uncle Terry, like a king, the dear old
                  beggar! Well, I make it up to the family by meal now, and pork then, and potatoes
                  some other time. There he is this minute."</p>
               <p>Sure enough, there came this other good fellow, just as Geoffrey had taken his
                  second glass of ale. And this other good fellow bowed all around, and took a
                  pitcher of beer to the settle, Geoffrey paying for it. As he began to drink the
                  beer, Katy's cockney nephew, a light-haired, barefooted ten-year-old, came running
                  in from school, and Uncle Terry considerately bestowed on him a penny.</p>
               <p>"O my eye!" said Tony; "he gave me a penny. Oh! wot larks to give me a penny, an'
                  little Judy ain't but one gownd to bless herself over."</p>
               <p>"Come, now, Uncle Terry meant well; he has such a good heart," admonished Tony's
                  aunt.</p>
               <p>"Oh! an uncommon good 'art, which I'm glad mine ain't the same. Uncle Terry is
                  that style of infidel the Scripter deals in, wot don't care for their own. He has
                  drunk enough ale in four years to school little Judy uncommon."</p>
               <p>The small cockney danced about on his toes, filliped the despised penny into the
                  air, and went off, as he said, to "chuck it to Judy."</p>
               <p>Uncle Terry's wife was dead. Judy, plump<pb n="80-81" xml:id="VAC8381-00000041"/>
                  and ragged, sprawled about the door, playing with a wooden doll, while her mother,
                  feeble and disheartened, had hard work to obtain food and shelter for herself, her
                  child, and her <emph>good-hearted</emph> old parent.</p>
               <p>"What a contemptible wretch!" said Charlotte, looking back at the patriarch,
                  drinking his beer before the taxidermist's door as she and Geoffrey cantered
                  off.</p>
               <p>"Don't be hard on him," said Geoffrey. "You can see he means no harm. And what a
                  gracious air and smile, contented with himself and all the world!"</p>
               <p>"He ought not to be contented," said Charlotte; "and sometimes those who mean the
                  least harm do the most, because they don't mean to do well."</p>
               <p>As they reached their own gate, Mr. Hunter came out with a gloomy face, and
                  requested Geoffrey to walk down the lane with him. Father and son went on in
                  silence until Mr. Hunter sat down on the edge of Cold Spring basin. Then he
                  said:</p>
               <p>"Son Geoffrey, I've received your bills from college and from the dealers—bills
                  some of which have been running for four years."</p>
               <p>"I meant to speak to you of it, father," said Geoffrey; "but one thing and another
                  has prevented. College is a very expensive place, and I <emph>have</emph> somewhat
                  exceeded my income."</p>
               <p>"Son Geoffrey, your debts, over which I have spent this afternoon, amount to one
                  thousand dollars."</p>
               <p>"O father! I had no idea the amount was so much. Cannot payment be deferred, and I
                  will try to settle them myself," said Geoffrey, looking deeply distressed.</p>
               <p>"They must be paid at once, Geoffrey; and, as you know, it will be nearly two
                  years before you fully enter on the practice of your profession. And not only must
                  I be responsible for you until then, but it will need a large sum to provide you
                  with a library and fit you up an office."</p>
               <p>"You are certainly the best of fathers, and I am not ungrateful to you," broke out
                  Geoffrey. "And as for these debts, I hate myself for them, and wish I were at
                     the<pb n="82-83" xml:id="VAC8381-00000042"/> bottom of the sea. But I do hope,
                  father, that you will see that I have not spent all this money for myself. I have
                  brought home presents, as you know, and I gave Charlotte many little articles
                  which she would not buy for herself. Then I was frequently asked for something for
                  the poor; and I always took Charley to lectures and concerts; and I lent fives now
                  and then to the fellows, for I <emph>could not</emph> refuse when they asked. And
                  I made little New Year's gifts to some of the ladies in the professors' families.
                  And one way and another, the matter got quite ahead of me. Anyway, I'm sorry
                  enough."</p>
               <p>"The most trying point is, Geoffrey, that there was quite a serious bill at the
                  hotel," said Mr. Hunter in a sad voice.</p>
               <p>"That bill had interest in it; it's run the longest, and I <emph>had</emph> to
                  treat the fellow sometimes, and pay little bills for a visitor or two, and order a
                  bottle of stout or wine, now and then, for good-fellowship's sake, all in a
                  gentlemanly way, father. You know I'm no tippler."</p>
               <p>"I want a little serious talk with you, my son," said Mr. Hunter, as Geoffrey
                  stood uneasily kicking up pebbles with his toes, and grinding little holes in the
                  earth with his heels. "You are aware that I cannot take such an amount as this
                  from my income: it must be drawn from my bank stock. A part of that stock I have
                  reserved to start you suitably in life. This home-place I shall always retain for
                  your mother and myself. The bank stock from which I must draw money for your debts
                  I had laid up as marriage portions for your sisters. I feel that I am absolutely
                  robbing my girls to help my son. Is this right, Geoffrey?"</p>
               <p>"By no means," said Geoffrey earnestly. "It quite breaks my heart. But, father,
                  I'll one day make it right with you. You'll have a portion for Eva, and I'm bound
                  to succeed, and I shall consider my Charley as my especial care, and I'll give her
                  a stunning outfit when she gets ready to marry."</p>
               <p>"Remember, Geoffrey, no more debts," said Mr. Hunter.</p>
               <p>"No more, upon my word. Forgive me,<pb n="84-85" xml:id="VAC8381-00000043"/>
                  father, I have treated you miserably; but, indeed, I never meant to do it, and
                  I'll make it all right for you and the girls."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey looked so sad and so earnest that his father shook hands with him,
                  remarked that they would say no more about it, and then the two walked to the
                  house arm in arm.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hunter, who knew of the debts, looked at Geoffrey with the spectacles placed
                  over each other; but he said so humbly, "You're not angry, are you, mother?" that
                  she put one pair upon her cap border; and when he read "Peter Bell," that evening,
                  she changed the glasses twice; and finally, when her tall son came to her chair
                  and stooped down to kiss her good-night, she laid both pair of glasses in her lap,
                  and said: "God bless you, Geoffrey, you are the Best Fellow in the World."</p>
               <p>"Lottie," said Mr. Hunter a few days after, "I do not see how I can support the
                  expense of you and Geof at Ames's. Don't you think you'd better stay at home?"</p>
               <p>"Very well, father," said Charlotte.</p>
               <p>Three weeks passed. Geoffrey was getting ready to go to study with his uncle, and
                  Charlotte seemed to be getting ready too. She went to her father. "You know I wish
                  to study law with Geoffrey, father."</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear child; but I told you I did not see how to pay bills for you
                  both."</p>
               <p>"I've written to Uncle Ames, and have made arrangements about teaching some, and
                  can see to my own bills, if you can give me money now for my travelling expenses.
                  I'm going to write for a magazine, and a paper besides, and that will bring me all
                  the money I need."</p>
               <p>"Travelling expenses!" cried Mr. Hunter. "You shall have them, and welcome. There
                  are fifty dollars for you, Charlotte, and I wish Geoffrey were more like you."</p>
               <p>While at home, Geoffrey felt much touched by his father's sorrow and
                  disappointment, and fully resolved hereafter to devote himself rather to study
                  than good-fellowship, and to spend no more money than he received—admirable
                  resolutions, the carrying out of which would have blessed himself, his<pb
                     n="86-87" xml:id="VAC8381-00000044"/> family, and the world. But Geoffrey was
                  far too good a fellow to be an unmixed blessing. Once fairly established in the
                  family and the office of Judge Ames, Geoffrey made a multitude of friends, he knew
                  not how. Society <figure/> received him with open arms, and no man was more
                  sincerely his admirer than the dignified Judge. Aunt Ames and Miss Mary Ames, the
                  daughter of the house, some five or six years older than Geoffrey, yielded at once
                  to that young man's fascinations. While they respected the serene Charlotte more,
                  they lavished admiring love on the gushing Geoffrey. Time would fail to tell of
                  the dressing-gowns and slippers, the smoking-caps and writing-desks, the gold
                  pens, and seals, and rings, and choice books that were bestowed on this same
                  Geoffrey. In less than a year Uncle Ames was giving card-parties, and keeping a
                  fast horse for him, and was thoroughly convinced that his convivial nephew was the
                  best read, the most eloquent, the handsomest, and most industrious young man in
                  the State. All this petting and adulation caused Charlotte to fear. She dreaded
                  the wines and the late suppers, the hosts of friends, and the demands of society
                  that divided Geoffrey's time with study. Charlotte felt instinctively that
                  somewhat of coldness, of restriction, of disappointment, would have on Geoffrey
                  all the tonic effect of a douche bath. It was idle to remonstrate; for, if
                  reproved, Geoffrey at first admirably defended himself, then repented, and
                  promised amendment, and, feeling<pb n="88-89" xml:id="VAC8381-00000045"/> ing
                  himself already vastly improved by the penitence, immediately sinned again.
                  Charlotte wished vainly that Geoffrey were less attractive and less talented, that
                  he was forced to study more for what he acquired; but, alas! Geoffrey learned as
                  if by magic, saw strong and weak points at a glance, and could construct a fine
                  argument, and wind it up with a brilliant peroration, while other people were
                  casting about for a beginning.</p>
               <p>These characteristics, which the clear-eyed Charlotte saw as the elements of ruin,
                  because Geoffrey suffered them to run to waste without considering them a loan
                  from Heaven, were regarded by other people as the auguries of Geoffrey's success.
                  How many prophecies of future high achievements were treasured up in the hearts of
                  Geoffrey's loving friends! Nor do we assert that Charlotte expected less. She
                  believed in Geoffrey, she hoped for him, and, feeling that life could not be even
                  for him a calm summer sea, she expected to find him made strong by trial when it
                  came, and believed that, when he entered the practice of his profession, he would
                  prove worthy of himself and his great gifts.</p>
               <p>The church looked also upon Geoffrey with a favoring eye. He was regarded as a
                  young man very near to the kingdom of heaven, if not indeed in it already. He was
                  regular and respectful in his attendance on church services, ready to give to her
                  charities and for the spread of the Gospel. As far as Geoffrey himself was
                  concerned, he had no doubts; he regarded himself with the same geniality with
                  which he looked on other people, and, when human duties or God's requirements were
                  the theme, like the young man in Scripture, he was ready to say, "All these have I
                  kept from my youth up." That cheerful young ruler, frank and gracious, toward whom
                  the human tenderness even of our Saviour was drawn out, has been set in Holy Writ
                  as the warning type of all such as our Geoffrey until time shall end.</p>
               <p>"My dear Charley," said Geoffrey to his sister, when, coming home from the
                  communion, she said some solemn words to him, "I do mean to join the church some
                     day.<pb n="90-91" xml:id="VAC8381-00000046"/> Don't worry for me, Charley. I do
                  not take anything in such dead earnest as you do, but I get on very well all the
                  same."</p>
               <p>The generosity of Uncle Ames prevented Geoffrey from contracting any debts during
                  the time of his legal studies. Everything prospered with him; his father forgot
                  the errors of the past; all that the most censorious could urge against him was
                  that he took too much wine now and then, but, as Geoffrey cheerfully observed,
                  "Charley made up for that by her total abstinence."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey was intensely proud of his sister, and delighted in hearing Uncle Ames
                  declare she would be as good a lawyer as himself. The young woman's unusual
                  studies were not without their embarrassments and disadvantages. In those days,
                  being "strong-minded" was even a greater disgrace than at present. Young ladies,
                  prodigal of perfumes and small talk, shrank from the girl who preferred
                  jurisprudence to poetry, and Blackstone's "Commentaries" to the last romance.
                  These gentle damsels regarded an earnest-faced young person, who read up cases
                  with avidity, and disputed with other law students on forfeiture of office by
                     <emph>mis-user</emph> or <emph>non-user,</emph> as hardly a proper
                  acquaintance. She certainly was a dangerous companion, for by her side their
                  trivial characters revealed too clearly the paste and tinsel, as bogus jewelry
                  cannot sustain the near presence of fine gold and gems.</p>
               <p>The surface triflers of society are often more agreeable to young men than solid
                  worth, and Charlotte had few admirers, except among grave and reverend seniors,
                  who, contemplating frequent depletions of their purses, vainly wished that their
                  daughters were like her. She found in Hector Gray, erst Geoffrey's
                     <emph>chum,</emph> now a medical student, one, however, who asked her to leave
                  law for love. He was a noble fellow, and Charlotte liked him well for lofty
                  virtues which found echo in herself.</p>
               <p>"I have never found any one to love better than Geoffrey," said Charlotte. "I do
                  not say that I shall never marry, but I do not feel inclined to do so now. If
                     you<pb n="92-93" xml:id="VAC8381-00000047"/> please, we will drop this subject.
                  I thank you, and I wish you well; but I had rather you now gave me up entirely,
                  and never asked me again."</p>
               <p>It was not like other women; there was no blush, no hesitation. Charlotte's clear
                  eye met Hector Gray's with unfaltering frankness. He saw that his cause was
                  hopeless.</p>
               <p>"Then I have lost a great deal out of my life," he said.</p>
               <p>"No; you will find that a mistake," said Charlotte, without a thought of vanity.
                  "We are too much alike, each to supply what the other lacks. Generally when a man
                  likes a woman, and takes pleasure in her society, he imagines he wants her for his
                  wife, when, probably, he only really needs her friendship." Then, perhaps, a
                  prophecy of the future flitted across Charlotte's vision, for she added,
                  "Hereafter, if I need a friend, I shall think of you."</p>
               <p>Shortly after this their lives were slipping far apart.</p>
               <p>The law studies were finished, and Charlotte and Geoffrey turned their attention
                  toward New York as a place to enter into practice. It was far from home, but
                  business would in a great degree cut them off from home even were they settled
                  near. When their father had furnished their rooms and their office, these two knew
                  they must depend upon their own exertions, and it was Charlotte's part to make
                  their expenses fall within their income. Indeed, Charlotte was wise enough to have
                  a margin on the part of the income, for she well knew into how many extravagances
                  the Best Fellow in the World was tempted by his bountiful disposition.</p>
               <p>While Geoffrey could come before the court and obtain a license to practice,
                  Charlotte, with the same qualifications, was denied this privilege. We hear that
                  customs are different now. It made little matter, however, for Charlotte had not
                  the least desire to plead in court, or to appear in public—that should be
                  Geoffrey's work. She was to be the silent partner, content to read and think, and
                  do office-work, out of sight even of the clients.</p>
               <pb n="94-95" xml:id="VAC8381-00000048"/>
               <p>In this mystery of her presence and her labor, she and Geoffrey found great
                  delight. They entered into their little romance of the visible and the invisible,
                  the speaking and the silent partners, with all youth's zest. It was the piquant
                  spice to their work-day, solid lives. Being Geoffrey's partner, Charlotte was also
                  his housekeeper; making half his business firm, she also made his home. They could
                  not afford the expense of boarding, nor in her peculiar life did Charlotte like
                  the publicity of a boarding-house. The ample stores of the dear, old-fashioned
                  mother could set up the twins in housekeeping.</p>
               <p>On leaving Uncle Ames, taking with them a present of valuable books and pictures,
                  the brother and sister went to New York to hire their rooms. The office, in a good
                  situation for business, consisted of one large, well-lighted room, with a very
                  small room opening from it. In one of the towers of the University building, they
                  rented two communicating chambers for their home. Having secured these apartments,
                  they returned for visit and preparation to the distant farm, with its river, and
                  its spring, and its peaceful domestic life.</p>
               <p>Pride beamed through dear mother Hunter's spectacles at sight of her twins. Pride
                  she had also in pretty Eva, who was engaged to be married, but it had been decided
                  that the young couple should live at home, and George should help Mr. Hunter carry
                  on the farm. Charlotte was mostly busy with her mother making carpets and bedding,
                  and getting ready for the small housekeeping in the University tower.</p>
               <p>Said Geoffrey, "Charley, you can do the home fixing, and I'll tend to the
                  office."</p>
               <p>"Yes. But don't be too extravagant with the office, Geof. Don't tax father too
                  heavily."</p>
               <p>Yet Charlotte knew that father would be taxed in a generous, free-and-easy fashion
                  which he could not resist, particularly when love and pride argued in his heart
                  along with his son. So, knowing that Geoffrey would be lavish, Charlotte was
                  economical, and was so glad that Uncle Ames had supplied them with works of art
                  and taste, and<pb n="96-97" xml:id="VAC8381-00000049"/> that their home could now
                  be beautiful without being expensive.</p>
               <p>While Charlotte was busy, Geoffrey was royally idle, and went hither and hither
                  with the birds and the butterflies. He followed them to the "taxidermist's," one
                  day, and found Katy clad in black. "And is it you, sir?" cried Katy. "Sit down in
                  my big chair, and take a glass of ale, and a welcome, while we give a thought to
                  him that's dead and gone. Moreland hunts no more, and I'm alone. Never was such a
                  man for birds; and he followed them down into the swamps in Virginia, and took the
                  chills and the typhus, and so he died, the dear. Just look at the birds and the
                  insects. Yon's a fine cecropia, and next it a sphinx—the ugly-looking
                  creature!—that he caught the last time ever he went out-of-doors. Indeed, he had a
                  way with him that seemed to bring the fool things right into his net. He set great
                  store by that peacock moth. It has a long satin mane, sir, and came to him from
                  Europe by a friend. O dear!"</p>
               <p>"You have many birds, Mrs. Moreland, and as my sister and I are going to
                  house-keeping, couldn't you sell us a few for our rooms?" said Geoffrey, handing
                  Mrs. Moreland the empty ale-glass, which, unasked, she replenished.</p>
               <p>"Don't be asking me, sir. All that was Moreland's—bird, or skin, or bug—that I
                  must keep as he left it, sir. He gave me the house and a bit of money in the bank,
                  and I have the business, sir. I couldn't be wronging him by selling the birds he
                  took his death hunting."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moreland's nephew, Tony, who had grown much, came in, and Geoffrey shook
                  hands, as if the lad had been a prince and Geoffrey himself a courtier. The boy
                  took a brown pitcher and filled it with beer, and stood waiting.</p>
               <p>"Who's coming, Tony?" asked his aunt.</p>
               <p>"That partic'lar good fellow, Uncle Terry," replied Tony. "Come to spend another
                  loaf of bread out of little Judy's mouth, and she's thin as a rail now. Wish't you
                  were in any other business, Aunt Katy."</p>
               <p>"Uncle Terry is alive, and fond of his beer<pb n="98-99" xml:id="VAC8381-00000050"
                  /> as ever?" said Geoffrey, glancing out of the door to see the old man.</p>
               <p>"<emph>Fonder,</emph> I'd say, and takes a sup of brandy frequent," replied,
                  Tony.</p>
               <p>But his aunt interrupted:</p>
               <p>"But he is a real good old fellow, after all—means no harm, Tony."</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes," piped the youthful cockney, not to be deceived. "A werry conwenient and
                  unexceptionable old person. Never means no harm, but is allus a doing a plenty;
                  an' is so particular cantankerous once in a while, all from bein' so
                     extr<emph>a</emph>ordinary am<emph>i</emph>able an'
                  ad<emph>mir</emph>able."</p>
               <p>Tony darted out, pushed Uncle Terry irreverently into a corner of the settle, gave
                  him the beer, and came in again.</p>
               <p>"Tony don't like my selling ale and beer. He got some whims from a speaker. But
                  never mind, Tony. I keep the place respectable, and, when I'm dead, you can have
                  it all your own way," said Katy.</p>
               <p>Tony was subdued at once, and sniffed out that "he'd go drown'd hisself if his
                  aunt up an' died. He didn't think much of goin' back on a feller that way:" Then
                  he got a book from behind a stuffed coon, and mounting into the window, with a
                  stuffed squirrel holding a nut over his head, a solemn white owl in a case on one
                  side of him, and a damp beer-barrel, turned on its side and leaking slowly from
                  the spigot, behind him, he read in peace. Katy saw the leak, and stopped it, just
                  as Uncle Terry started homewards, followed by Tony's advice to "get the folks a
                  slap-up supper."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey tossed Tony a silver half-dollar, bidding him divide it between himself
                  and Judy, and then went his way. It was some time before he again sat in Katy's
                  big chair.</p>
               <p>Trunks, boxes, and barrels were packed. Fully equipped, as far as was possible to
                  parental prudence, both mentally and physically, for the battle of life, Geoffrey
                  and Charlotte were ready to go out to win or die.</p>
               <p>It was the last evening at home, and the family conclave were gathered about a
                  bright wood-fire in the mother's room. The fire glittered on Mrs. Hunter's
                  carefully polished spectacles. She changed them<pb n="100-101"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000051"/> again and again, and viewed her son under every
                  possible arrangement of glasses.</p>
               <p>"Well, mother," said the cheerful Geoffrey, "what do you think of me? And what
                  advice have you to offer on this momentous occasion?"</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey," replied Mrs. Hunter, resolutely putting both glasses together, "if you
                  were a little less good, you'd be much better."</p>
               <p>"Fie, mammy dear, that's a paradox," said Geoffrey lightly.</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey," said his mother, repenting, and using kind eyes alone, "you are the
                  Best Fellow that ever was. But, my son, take Charlotte's advice—she's a sensible
                  woman."</p>
               <p>"Oh! I mean to do that," said Geoffrey heartily. "She is to be the thinking brain,
                  and I the eloquent tongue."</p>
               <p>"But, Geoffrey," said Eva, "you know the Bible says the tongue is an unruly
                  member, and full of deadly poison. Now, <emph>that</emph> doesn't at all describe
                  you."</p>
               <p>"There's no poison about me," said Geoffrey, laughing, "except what Charley
                  affirms I pour into me from a jolly little glass of wine used for
                  good-fellowship's sake."</p>
               <p>"Don't be so priggish, Lottie," said Eva.</p>
               <p>Mother Hunter suddenly put on a pair of spectacles, and said:</p>
               <p>"My son, don't touch wine. Many a little glass of wine has held the seed of
                  death."</p>
               <p>"The better part of valor is discretion," quoted father Hunter. "Safety is in
                  abstinence, son Geoffrey."</p>
               <p>"What nonsense!" cried the hasty Eva. "Don't make an old fogy of our Geoffrey. Let
                  him be what he was meant for—a liberal, genial gentleman."</p>
               <p>"He can most perfectly reach that high estate without the cup, which has
                  undoubtedly ruined many of his fellow-men," said Charlotte. And, taking her lamp,
                  she left the room.</p>
               <p>Hitherto our story has lingered, as the Happy River lingers along its summer
                  banks, the wavelets <q>
                     <lg type="quotation">
                        <l>"Enforced to go, and seeming still unready,</l>
                        <l>Backward they wind their way in many a wistful eddy."</l>
                     </lg>

               </p>
               <pb n="102-103" xml:id="VAC8381-00000052"/>
               <p>Geoffrey's life-work was before him. Now was his time to choose for ruin or
                  success. Behind him closed the gates of school and college. No more would parents
                  and teachers be about him a prudent bodyguard. Straight and plain before him lay
                  the road to honor and fame. He was at a point where he could not stand still; he
                  must make speedily some decisive move, and now his truant feet turned out of the
                  beaten way, and stood upon the quicksand of pleasure, and it began to slide
                  beneath his steps.</p>
               <p>Never was a young man more thoroughly furnished forth for victory over every
                  adversary than was our Geoffrey. Well provided for his work, he did not enter upon
                  it unheralded and unknown. Judge Ames had bespoken friends and confidence for his
                  nephew. Affection and pride bound the college faculty to their favorite pupil, and
                  they had sent forth his praise. Overhelping seems generally a hindrance to our
                  easily tempted nature. Left alone, or severely buffeted, Geoffrey might have
                  vindicated dicated his manhood; but, as soon as he entered New York, friends
                  gathered about him, and, instead of being enrolled among the brotherhood of
                  indomitable workers, Geoffrey Hunter was elected King of the Royal Good Fellows.
                  From the first, business flowed in upon the new firm. Charlotte trembled when she
                  found that the income upon which she had based her calculations would be
                  doubled—trembled because she felt that Geoffrey's expenses would be quadrupled on
                  the strength of that doubling. Geoffrey pleaded cases in court, and his success
                  was that of Job in his palmiest days.</p>
               <p>"When the ear heard him, then it blessed him. After his speech they spoke not
                  again, and their tongue cleaved to the roof of their mouth."</p>
               <p>Flatterers crowded about him; politicians wanting a sharp and shining weapon
                  courted him. When the speech was made and the case was won, the successful pleader
                  and his friends adjourned to some restaurant of the <emph>highest
                     respectability,</emph> where they drank<pb n="104-105"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000053"/> wines and brandies to his health and prosperity,
                  ate a costly supper, played somewhere a game of cards or billiards, and then
                  perhaps, as the stars were setting or the gray morning creeping along the eastern
                  horizon, the King of Good Fellows, flushed and jovial, sought his home in the
                  University tower. He let himself in with the latch-key, and always found the
                  lounge-bed in their parlor prepared by Charlotte's careful hands, and the gas
                  turned low.</p>
               <p>Wives watch for truant husbands, and count the hours, and weep.</p>
               <p>It is doubtful if any princely good fellow or any drunkard has been converted by
                  these vigils. Geoffrey found no Charlotte sitting up for him. She knew that, when
                  his brain was hot with wine, hers must be sleep-soothed for the labors of the
                  coming day. What time he wasted, she must save; what labor he neglected, she must
                  perform. This silent and invisible partner of this firm, when evening studies and
                  meditations were concluded, and her devoted heart felt that woeful burden of her
                  twin-brother's danger and sin most grievously crushing peace and hope, turned to a
                  Burden-Bearer of eternal strength, and gave the care to him; then slept, that,
                  having prayed to-night, she might to-morrow wisely couple work with prayer.</p>
               <p>The jolly Geoffrey slept in his curtained alcove, until Charlotte's home duties
                  were concluded and office hours had come, then, buoyant and boastful, rose to
                  drink the coffee she had prepared, brushed out his shining hair, laughed his
                  sister's fears to scorn, condemned her remonstrances as "moralizing," and,
                  courteously giving his arm to "Charley dear," went out to perform in some short
                  time some great task—to sparkle with wit, to glow with eloquence, to achieve some
                  higher and more precarious pinnacle than had been attained yesterday, and thus,
                  overstraining mind and body, swept nearer to ruin every day.</p>
               <p>There were days when prodigies of work were performed, when, long after the office
                  hours were over, Geoffrey wrote and studied. There were other days when he did
                  nothing at all, and his office while open was thronged<pb n="106-107"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000054"/> with jesters and flatterers, who schemed for
                  pleasure, for games, and suppers, and treats, and excursions, as if Heaven had
                  ordained man to perpetual holiday. While pleasure thus ruled in the outer room of
                  Geoffrey's office, industry and perseverance retired to that room within, and kept
                  ward over Charlotte's desk. The door remained fast closed. The silent partner
                  worked alone. When Geoffrey must come for counsel, he was signalled by a sharp
                  bell-stroke, and not one of those pleasure-seeking youths dreamed that just within
                  hearing, but shutting her ears to their voices, a girl, who lived, as Geoffrey
                  said, "in dead earnest," kept the flourishing young lawyer's business in order,
                  and Geoffrey's sister, with unswerving courage, strove to work out at least the
                  business salvation of her twin.</p>
               <p>Working, working still. The ponderous law tomes and reports of cases were turned
                  oftenest by Charlotte's hand. The good points for which Geoffrey was applauded
                  were frequently first seen by that eye which, no clearer, no stronger of vision
                  than his own, was ever undiverted from the case in hand.</p>
               <p>People troubled themselves very little about Geoffrey Hunter's partner. When the
                  fact of the partner presented itself, some suggested that it was a deaf and
                  crabbed old man; others got up a little romance about a deformed young man, and
                  held it on the grounds of very beautiful, clear, bold handwriting that appeared in
                  the young lawyer's files of papers, and because on some occasions Geoffrey had
                  called out "Charley!" to bring attention to some paper he was slipping through a
                  letter-slit in the wall above his table. One or two adventurous youths had been
                  known to peep into this aperture, but it slanted so that they had only a very
                  restricted view of a bit of cocoa matting on the floor, and as for the door of
                  this inner office, it opened only from within.</p>
               <p>It was well known that Geoffrey's sister had her home with him, and did a funny,
                  picnicking sort of housekeeping in the University tower, for his friends had
                     passed<pb n="108-109" xml:id="VAC8381-00000055"/> pleasant evenings with the
                  brother and sister in their charming retreat. The sister, though voted talented
                  and agreeable, was supposed to be hostile to particular attentions from young
                  gentlemen, and not especially anxious for friends of her own sex. When any of her
                  few lady acquaintances complained that they "never could find her," Charlotte
                  simply replied that she liked "to help her brother, was not often at home in the
                  day-time, and read a good deal." She was presumed to frequent libraries and
                  picture-galleries.</p>
               <p>Charlotte may have craved more or different society than she had, but she was not
                  likely to suffer from it, being of a nature satisfied with the earnest pursuit of
                  a fixed purpose. She did not intend to allow herself to be beguiled from business
                  these few years, for she firmly expected Geoffrey would some time grow weary of
                  pleasure and wine and fast living, and "<emph>settle down;</emph>" until then,
                  hers must be the laboringoar.</p>
               <p>How many women have worn their lives out waiting for son, husband, or brother to
                     <emph>settle down!</emph>
               </p>
               <p>Getting discouraged over late hours, negligence, extravagance, and the cheerful
                  temperament that saw harm in nothing that was pleasing, Charlotte sometimes
                  comforted herself by going to hear Geoffrey plead a case in court, trusting that
                  his resistless eloquence would charm her as it charmed others, and give her heart
                  again. It was a gratification, also, to behold, in carefully-treasured facts, the
                  result of her own plodding, to hear her best thoughts clad in brilliant rhetoric,
                  to see the rough sketching of the "inner office," perfected and unimpeachable as
                  it was, presented in court.</p>
               <p>It is true she sometimes heard more than she wished, as when a stranger near her
                  said of the eloquent young lawyer, "The most talented and promising fellow ever in
                  our courts, who might aspire to anything, were he not so convivial and dangerously
                  given to wine."</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
               <p>ONE year passed, and Geoffrey Hunter was still dividing his time between Love and
                  Pleasure.</p>
               <p>Many men have found Love a jealous mistress, who will not divide attentions with
                  literature. When a lawyer turns aside to court the muses or dally with romance, he
                  must generally cleave to them thenceforth, for Love will have no more to do with
                  him. Intemperance does not seem so entirely to disable a man for legal studies and
                  practice as does authorship. While the wine-bibber is rejected as a teacher,
                  disgraced as a minister, and distrusted as a physician, his debauch over, he may
                  hold his head up among his fellow-attorneys, and, if he be a man of talents and
                  culture, may succeed with the best.</p>
               <p>Thus our convivial Best Fellow obtained plenty of business, and received liberal
                  fees, drank wine and hotter, more poisonous drinks as he played shady games in
                  secret places of evenings, and boldly stood forth next day, and appealed to the
                  sacred name of justice whether he pleaded for the right or wrong.</p>
               <p>Over Charlotte's face had grown a shadow, and a setting of the muscles that told
                  of endurance. There had been nights when Geoffrey had not come home at all; but,
                  then, next day he had not failed to present himself in Charlotte's inner office,
                  with tender enquiries after her health, poor excuses for his absence, fluent
                  thanks for her busy helping, and eloquent protestations of his love and
                  confidence. Not only had Geoffrey at times failed to come home, but there had been
                  one or two bitterer hours when Charlotte had seen her handsome brother, her life's
                  idol, drunk. Perhaps it was even less painful and hopeless to see him overpowered
                  and degraded, unconscious of everything, the thinking soul reduced to the level of
                  the brute, than to find him, on returning to consciousness, regarding his excess
                  as a trifle demanding no penitence.</p>
               <pb n="112-113" xml:id="VAC8381-00000057"/>
               <p>He woke from his heavy sleep, opening his eyes just as the afternoon sun slanted
                  in at the tower window across the book from which Charlotte was rapidly taking
                  notes. The curtains were looped back from the alcove, and, as Geoffrey gave a deep
                  breath, Charlotte turned her head—her look was undeniably one of reproach and
                  pain.</p>
               <p>"What are you doing, Charley dear?"</p>
               <p>"Studying up this case of Gray <abbr>vs.</abbr> Brandt, which you ought to have
                  been at all day," said Charlotte with sharpness.</p>
               <p>"Yes, my dear; and I'll get at it presently, and be like Ajax, the son of Oïleus,
                  in the fervor of my attack on the technicalities. What's the matter, Charley?
                  Anything wrong? Case going against us, think? Cheer up, my friend! A few quibbles,
                  brilliantly stated, will carry along with them the convictions of any jury in the
                  land. I've told you so often, Charley."</p>
               <p>"The case is clear as daylight, and right is on our side, as I told you from the
                  first, Geof. But I do not consider it half as important that, in this breach of
                  contract suit, we obtain judgment for Gray, as it is that you, Geoffrey, of whom I
                  have been so proud, for whom I have hoped so much and have loved so well, should
                  come home in the condition you were last night—should be as you have been
                  to-day."</p>
               <p>"Well, Charley, my best!" cried Geoffrey, ignoring the first point of his sister's
                  accusation, "it is a shame for me to lie in bed while you work. But my head feels
                  hot and foggy for a moment; it will pass away, and, as I was telling you, I'll be
                  up and at it in an instant."</p>
               <p>Then as Charlotte, still turned from her book, regarded him with the countenance
                  of an accusing angel, Geoffrey said: "My dear girl, I'd much sooner you praised me
                  for the triumphant manner in which I won Black's case yesterday. That point I
                  made, that Nelson's testimony was not <emph>legal evidence,</emph> was a beautiful
                  thing. Praise me for that, Charley, love, and don't throw up any little
                  indiscretions at Black's supper."</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey, your conduct is not a little indiscretion. You know that, if you
                     were<pb n="114-115" xml:id="VAC8381-00000058"/> ill or disabled, I would
                  willingly work for you all the days of my life; but you are destroying your good
                  name, disappointing the hopes of your family, falling short of the success for
                  which we all have toiled in your behalf. You are setting a bad example, and,
                  instead of helping to purify and ennoble society, you are degrading it. You are
                  not proving yourself worthy of those lofty qualities which God bestowed upon
                  you."</p>
               <p>"Tut, tut!" said Geoffrey easily. "Even wise women will exaggerate and be
                  fanatical. Why are you so down on a little jollity and good-fellowship? It wins a
                  man friends, brightens his life, enlarges the circle of his acquaintances, and,
                  politically, gives him no end of help. It also sharpens his wits. My child, I
                  shine nowhere so well, and nowhere win so many suffrages, as when presiding at a
                  convivial supper, partaken entirely by gentlemen. I'm better than new after it,
                  Charley, so where's the harm?"</p>
               <p>"The harm, Geoffrey? You commit a sin against God."</p>
               <p>"I don't look at it at all in that light— don't understand it. In truth," Geoffrey
                  added lightly, "I may be versed in common and statute law, but I cannot apprehend
                  law celestial. I may win cases in these sublunary courts, where shine the wisdom
                  and the wickedness of New York, but the court of Heaven pleads cases too high for
                  me."</p>
               <p>"Don't, Geoffrey," pleaded Charlotte, shocked. "Your name means <emph>at peace
                     with God;</emph> but, instead, you are neither at peace with God yourself, nor
                  your fellow-men."</p>
               <p>"You're out there, Charlotte," said Geoffrey. "I haven't an enemy in the
                  world."</p>
               <p>"Then, again, Geoffrey, these habits you are forming are going to destroy your
                  business," said Charlotte, going back to Geoffrey's question, and passing over the
                  fact of his popularity.</p>
               <p>"Out again, my love. I could tear this little case you are making out against me
                  into fragments. My business prospers: my genial disposition fosters it. When it
                  begins to decline, Cassandra, begin to warn!"</p>
               <p>"And, Geoffrey," continued the resolute Charlotte, "you are sinning against
                     yourself,<pb n="116-117" xml:id="VAC8381-00000059"/> injuring your health, your
                  ability, your reputation."</p>
               <p>"All imagination, my dear girl! As to health, I am stronger and stronger, weigh
                  more, eat more, sleep more, as see to-day. As to my ability, I told you that wine
                  and friends sharpened my wits—afforded the relaxation which I need. I feel my
                  intellectual powers developed every day. When I begin to fail, <emph>then</emph>
                  warn me. As to the matter of reputation, Charley, you know my friends are the
                  first men in the city. We go only to places of the highest respectability; we take
                  the refreshments of gentlemen as gentlemen. I do no more, no more than the rest.
                  We all do well. There's no more harm in drinking a little too much than in eating
                  a little too much. In company, one is often led to do it unawares. It didn't hurt
                  the reputation of that grand old ark-builder, who refounded the race, to take a
                  post-prandial potation and consequent snooze. There, Charley, I'll up and
                  rejuvenate, and <emph>then</emph> I'll dip into the case with you, and we'll set
                  Gray on his legs forthwith. No wonder you believe in his side; perchance you have
                  a little stray tenderness for Doctor Hector Gray?"</p>
               <p>"No, I never had; but I like him, and shall be glad to help him," replied
                  Charlotte, turning to her book, as Geoffrey pulled the cords that held back the
                  alcove curtains, and was shut out of sight.</p>
               <p>A mist swam before the open pages, and the words she traced on her paper blurred
                  before her eyes. It was so hard to hear Geoffrey thus jovially defend his
                  wrong-doing.</p>
               <p>The cause of Gray <abbr>vs.</abbr> Brandt was gained. It was an affair of great
                  importance to the doctor, and to his fee he added sincere gratitude for the skill
                  and energy displayed in his behalf.</p>
               <p>Charlotte was glad. She rejoiced when in their business they could bring truth to
                  light, and cause right to triumph over wrong. She was no less glad when, a few
                  months after, they received Doctor Gray's wedding-cards.</p>
               <p>"A little bit disappointed, Charley?" said<pb n="118-119"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000060"/> Geoffrey quizzically, looking over to where his
                  sister stood by the window with the square, satin-tied envelope in her hand.</p>
               <p>"No, surely not," said Charlotte, smiling.</p>
               <p>"I'm glad you've no mind to marry yet, I can't spare you," said Geoffrey; "but,
                  when you do conclude to take a husband, what sort of a man will he be—any like me,
                  Charley?"</p>
               <p>Charlotte half-smiled, half-sighed, as she shook her head. One grievous fault
                  prevented this Geoffrey, whom she loved and lived for, from being her ideal. He
                  sat now looking toward her, turned about so that his chin rested on his hands
                  clasped over his chair-back—such a handsome Geoffrey, with flashing eyes and
                  sunbright hair, but with the story of his fatal error even now being written over
                  a face that, carved in marble, would have been its sculptor's glory.</p>
               <p>"I'm going to bring an old fogy here, to-night, Charley. I'm cultivating his
                  acquaintance, primarily because I never can turn a cold shoulder to anybody that I
                  get introduced to; secondarily, because he will be a perfect treasure-trove in our
                  business, if we come out sociable as hand and glove. He's the chief of the
                  detectives, and a man, they say, with a wonderful head, and just as wonderful an
                  amount of that metal that rings in you, partner—perseverance."</p>
               <p>Charlotte was for ever building new air-castles for Geoffrey, planting new hopes
                  for him; and, when the place she had chosen proved treacherous, her castles fell,
                  and her harvests failed, she sought other grounds, and went to work again. So now,
                  when Geoffrey mentioned this new friend, she divined that he was different from
                  the wine-bibbing, jolly-supper, billiard-playing crew who were drawing Geoffrey
                  the Easy to ruin, and she began to plan and hope that this friendship should
                  supplant the others—that this man should bind Geoffrey to a soberer and a better
                  life.</p>
               <p>Oliver Alden came that evening: it was the first of many visits. Ten years older
                  than Geoffrey, grave and honest, devoted to his business, with a keen mind and a
                  great fund of information, he attracted Geoffrey,<pb n="120-121"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000061"/> and the two were soon fast friends. Still, the good
                  effect of this intercourse which Charlotte had hoped did not follow: the chains of
                  pleasure were too closely wound <figure/> about the royal good fellow. If wine and
                  intoxicating liquors were not everywhere freely sold; if drunkenness, unassociated
                  with beggary and ribaldry, were deemed a disgrace; if the good fellows who
                  surrounded the Best Fellow had all been temperate while they were merry, Geoffrey
                  would not have fallen. But "drinks" were to be had in "places of unimpeachable
                  respectability." Geoffrey claimed that his friends were of high social position,
                  and they drank and sometimes got drunk, and disgrace was not attached to them as
                  to the artisan or the beggar who is intoxicated on cheap rum and picked up by the
                  police.</p>
               <p>This is the short history of that second year, that the business prospered and
                  friends increased, and Geoffrey was more and more given to the "social glass,"
                  which he had grown to love, and Charlotte trembled, protested, and pleaded.
                  Geoffrey jested, defended himself, made rash promises, and broke them gaily, and
                  no rumor of wrong or of danger went back to the homestead where beat the true
                  hearts that trusted in Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>The most important case upon which Geoffrey Hunter had yet been retained was soon
                  to be brought into court.</p>
               <p>A millionaire had died, and two men appeared, each claiming to be the legal heir,
                  and the one intended in the dead man's will. It was Geoffrey's good fortune to be
                  engaged upon what he truly believed to be the<pb n="122-123"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000062"/> right side of the case. He felt convinced that his
                  client was the true heir and a worthy young man. He began to work up the case with
                  ardor, seeing that both honor and emolument would accrue from his success.
                  Entering heartily into his interest, and building a new castle in the air, based
                  on months of earnest labor, Charlotte continually kept Geoffrey's attention fixed
                  on his case, searched out evidence, studied precedents, and was ever suggesting
                  some new point to her brother. Their friend, Oliver Alden, proved almost
                  invaluable. No man could better trace a hidden clue than he. In his own peculiar
                  line of life, his services were needed on this case, and long evenings were spent
                  in the little drawing-room of the University tower discussing the subject which so
                  deeply interested both. During these discussions, Charlotte, withdrawn from her
                  brother and his friend, sat, half in the shadow, listening and remembering,
                  gathering up hints that might have slipped from the notice of the absorbed
                  speakers. Oliver Alden had no idea that this girl was her brother's partner
                  ner—indeed, the chief worker in the firm.</p>
               <p>One evening Geoffrey produced a file of papers.</p>
               <p>"Who got these up for you?" demanded Mr. Alden, pouncing on the flawless
                  documents.</p>
               <p>"My partner," said Geoffrey quietly.</p>
               <p>"Your partner keeps himself always in the inner room, don't he?"</p>
               <p>"Always there," replied Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alden looked over the papers, mentally compared the writing with a name or two
                  he had seen written in some of the books lying about this little drawing-room,
                  noted the fact that business partners are not given to keeping themselves
                  invisible, recalled what he had heard, that Miss Hunter went to and from the
                  office sometimes with her brother, then turned and covertly studied the intent
                  face, whose profile was strongly relieved against the folds of the crimson
                  curtain.</p>
               <p>Turning to Geoffrey, and pointing to the papers, he said: "These were drawn up
                     by<pb n="124-125" xml:id="VAC8381-00000063"/> a mind fixed on the subject in
                  hand, untainted by wine, and undisturbed by what some call pleasure."</p>
               <p>"It is true that my partner is a glorious model," said Geoffrey. "In our firm, I
                  am the comet, my partner the fixed star."</p>
               <p>A shrewd guess pointed out the partner's identity to Mr. Alden, as it might to
                  others before him if they had cared to know. He had proof as well as guessing
                  within a few days, for, being in Geoffrey's office, the young lawyer went into the
                  inner room, and Mr. Alden took the unwarrantable liberty of putting his head in
                  after him. He drew it out as soon as he saw Charlotte steadily at work at her
                  desk, with Geoffrey bending over the paper she had just handed him. Oliver Alden
                  retreated unseen, and Geoffrey, who had not suspected the solemn detective of any
                  curiosity about the invisible partner, and so had left ajar the door which in
                  every other case he would have closed, returned to the outer office.</p>
               <p>From that moment Oliver Alden set Charlotte's image in some sacred shrine vacant
                  until now, and received her as his chosen pattern of womanhood. Always shy and
                  silent in the presence of a woman, he treasured every word that Charlotte uttered,
                  and, by some strange intuition, learning to sympathize with all her emotions, with
                  none more heartily accorded than with those that stirred and trembled over
                  Geoffrey, recklessly pressing to some painful fate.</p>
               <p>Again had Charlotte found herself deceived, for no sooner had she begun to take
                  comfort in Geoffrey's interest in the important suit than a new courtier suddenly
                  made his appearance, and fawned upon the King of Good Fellows.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey, with his customary heedlessness, accepted the man as his friend, and was
                  strangely fascinated by his accomplishments, his flatteries, his apparent wealth,
                  and his seeming knowledge of life. The man claimed to have travelled over all the
                  known portions of the earth, he had hunted elephants and lions, feasted with
                  notabilities of every land, and was a connoisseur of wines.</p>
               <p>He came to the tower-room, one evening,<pb n="126-127" xml:id="VAC8381-00000064"/>
                  with intention to be agreeable "to his dear friend's sister." Charlotte speedily
                  weighed him in the balance, and found him wanting. He dared not encounter her
                  again. He was introduced to Mr. Alden, but quailed before the detective's
                  searching eye, and was by that detective privately denominated "an unmitigated
                  scoundrel." While these two, Charlotte and Mr. Alden, were on either side Geoffrey
                  to keep him in safety, this man, in the name of pleasure, tempted the young lawyer
                  on to places where his best friends could not go. He haunted the office, but,
                  whatever were his plans, Charlotte, with a vigilance that Oliver Alden denominated
                  "tremendous," kept Geoffrey's treasures safe under lock and key. Charlotte felt
                  that the stranger was set for her brother's snare. He had led him on to excess
                  such as Geoffrey had never tried. There was danger that the great case should fail
                  at last, from Geoffrey's proving traitor to it and to himself.</p>
               <p>Charlotte betook herself to Oliver Alden. "I believe that man is hired by the
                  other side to divert Geoffrey from his case, to hinder his preparation, to
                  discover his line of argument, to destroy our case by means of Geof's
                  good-fellowship."</p>
               <p>"I have arrived at the same conclusion. We will each warn him."</p>
               <p>They warned, and he laughed them to scorn.</p>
               <p>But where woman's argument had failed, Charlotte betook herself to woman's wit.
                  Where appeal to Geoffrey's head was useless, Charlotte addressed herself to his
                  heart.</p>
               <p>Charlotte suddenly fell homesick. She wanted to go to Eva's wedding. Wouldn't
                  Geoffrey go?</p>
               <p>"I've been willing all the while, and you thought we could not spare money or
                  time. Have you changed your mind?" said Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>Circumstances had changed Charlotte's mind.</p>
               <p>The journey, the gifts, the new clothes, would not cost so much as Geoffrey was
                  now wildly wasting in dissipation. As to time, at home he <emph>might</emph> be
                  brought to attend to<pb n="128-129" xml:id="VAC8381-00000065"/> what he was now
                  led by his new friend entirely to neglect.</p>
               <p>Charlotte had said, "Geof, this man is trying to ruin you, doing it advisedly and
                  deliberately."</p>
               <p>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>"My beloved prophetess of evil," quoth Geoffrey, "no one can ruin me. I stand too
                  firmly."</p>
               <p>He stood on the most treacherous quicksand that ever has deceived humanity!</p>
               <p>"I feel convinced," replied Charlotte, "that this man is hired by the plaintiff to
                  distract your mind, weaken your powers, discover your plans, and make you lose
                  this suit. He will ruin you to ruin your client the defendant."</p>
               <p>"Charley, my dear, if I were so suspicious as you are, I should have peace neither
                  night nor day. I have faith in myself, faith in human nature, faith in
                  good-fellowship; the man cannot drink my health with tears of sincerity in his
                  eyes, and yet be plotting my destruction. O my dear, my silly dear!"</p>
               <p>"Tears!" cried the blunt Charlotte. "Tears of sincerity! Maudlin, crocodile tears,
                  you had better say. All the faith you have mentioned isn't worth a copper, Geof. I
                  wish you had faith in God, instead."</p>
               <p>All this had been of no avail, and Charlotte had taken another tack, and wanted to
                  go home. Geoffrey could finish his preparations there; they could leave the office
                  in Mr. Alden's charge; communication would be<pb n="130-131"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000066"/> easy if anything new turned up; they could be back
                  in time for the trial. In almost any other circumstances, Charlotte would have
                  advised to stay at the office and work. Now, she saw that only in retreat lay
                  safety. Geoffrey was too good a fellow to refuse to gratify his sister in any way
                  other than total reform, so he explained matters to his friend Alden, packed up
                  his papers, and prepared to go home for a visit. Despite Charlotte's warnings, he
                  told his convivial friend where he was going. Charlotte knew they would take home
                  keen sorrow as well as joy, for Geoffrey's face already told the story of that
                  wayward life which Charlotte had so long concealed from those trusting,
                  unsuspicious souls at the homestead.</p>
               <p>How many times did the good old mother arrange, change, and rearrange her
                  inquisitorial spectacles during the first half-hour of Geoffrey's visit! What was
                  the keen questioning of the honest father's eyes as he looked at the handwriting
                  of sin over the beautiful face he had loved so well? After tea, when Geoffrey had
                  gone out for a long moonlight walk with Eva, the mother said: "Charlotte, there is
                  something wrong. Tell us all: we must know some time."</p>
               <p>And as the twilight deepened in the room, and then the place grew silver-bright as
                  the moonbeams gathered in, Charlotte told the story of Geoffrey's success and his
                  errors, of the past and its hopes and troubles, the present with its work and
                  fears.</p>
               <p>Heavy in God's sight upon the soul of Geoffrey lay the tears those gray-haired
                  parents wept that day. Great weight of retribution must lie on every sinful son
                  whose wayward and wicked life makes his father and his mother weep.</p>
               <p>Urged by Charlotte's example, the interest of his parents, and by the new
                  freshness of spirit and clearness of brain that spring from regular hours and
                  absence of poisonous stimulants, Geoffrey, according to Charlotte's expectations,
                  applied himself to his business, and his work prospered in his hand. The quiet
                  purity that surrounded him soothed his excited spirit. On the green banks of the
                  Happy River, he regained<pb n="132-133" xml:id="VAC8381-00000067"/> gained some of
                  the zeal of youth that lately he had lost and broken. Seated on the rock-rim of
                  the well-remembered spring, Geoffrey's thoughts rose clear and fresh as its
                  treasure of waters. Link after link in the chain of evidence he welded with firm
                  hand; bright thought after bright thought shone forth to be threaded as jewels to
                  gain the judges and the jury before whom he should plead. Our Geoffrey was his old
                  bright, happy, genial self once more.</p>
               <p>Shadow of disappointment fell suddenly when before Charlotte, sitting in the
                  door-way, stood the convivial companion from whose fatal wiles she had just
                  rescued her brother. Geoffrey had wandered to study by the river, and Charlotte
                  seized her opportunity.</p>
               <p>"My brother is not here."</p>
               <p>"Shall I wait, or call again?" This with courtesy.</p>
               <p>"Sir," said Charlotte, for Geoffrey's sake ignoring courtesy, "you may do neither.
                  My brother came to see his family and to work in peace. Our house and our
                  hospitalities talities are free only to those whom we <emph>know</emph> and
                     <emph>trust.</emph>"</p>
               <p>After this, what could the enemy do but return to the village, where Geoffrey was
                  too busy to go? And there he might have uselessly waited a day or two, and then
                  gone back to the city. But there are women who are for ever meddling—women, also,
                  with whom a black moustache, shiny boots, kid gloves, and a twirling cane spell
                     <emph>gentleman</emph>—women who are for ever dying to meet strangers and make
                  new acquaintances. Eva was one of these women. She saw the stranger, and heard
                  Charlotte's words. She took part with the unknown against that good sister. She
                  despised Charlotte's explanation, and, in spite of Charlotte's warnings and
                  entreaties, went off and told Geoffrey. Geoffrey was too kind to get angry, but he
                  was sorry for his so-called friend. He bade Eva say no more to any one, and next
                  day rode off to the village to welcome his deadly foe. There was no studying after
                  that. Charlotte was left to work alone. The important speech with which
                     Geoffrey<pb n="134-135" xml:id="VAC8381-00000068"/> was to conclude his part of
                  the great property suit was scarcely thought of yet; and now, as often before,
                  Charlotte must blend hints and stray sentences from Geoffrey with suggestions of
                  her own, and sketch out a rough plan, hoping tremblingly that in some hour of
                  inspiration Geoffrey would work it up and use it for his victory. Sore days were
                  these to Charlotte, and the parents even, while bridal preparations went on. The
                  silly girl who had wrought the mischief repented, but was too trifling to realize
                  what she had done. For a night and a day had Geoffrey been gone. Charlotte was
                  fiercely restless; she worked in a frenzy. Evening came. As the excited girl paced
                  up and down the hall, Eva touched softly the keys of the piano. The music came as
                  balm. Charlotte entered the room and sat down in the window.</p>
               <p>"Play for me, Eva."</p>
               <p>It was little enough for Eva to do, and she assented readily. Sweet, low chord
                  after chord chased far off the demons of fear and despair. Resting her weary head
                  against the window, while the night winds cooled her heated forehead, Charlotte
                  could think in orderly fashion now.</p>
               <p>"I'm tiring you, Lottie dear," said Eva after a long time.</p>
               <p>"Go on," said Charlotte. "My speech is nearly finished. I shall soon have only to
                  write it out."</p>
               <p>Eva played on wondering; her fingers tripped along the keys; her head was turned
                  to watch Charlotte sitting by the window, while moonbeams crept through the rose
                  and clematis vines to lose themselves in the dusky twilight of her hair, against
                  which a white japonica, placed there by Eva, shone like a star. In that pale,
                  sorrow-softened face, in those large eyes into which the tremulous moonlight
                  shone, Eva found a revealing of a nature loftier and truer than her own—a nature
                  too faithful to yield to a heart-break, strong still to live and suffer for its
                  love.</p>
               <p>Charlotte wrote nearly all night, copying Geoffrey's fragments and loose pages,
                  getting everything into shape where he could<pb n="136-137"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000069"/> use it readily. Then, when the gates of morning
                  were opened, an angel stole through with a good thought for the faithful sister.
                  Charlotte refreshed herself with plentiful dashes of cold water, put on her
                  ridinghabit, had the stable-boy bring her favorite horse, and, while the others of
                  the family slept, galloped to the town, and, stopping before the hotel, sent
                  peremptory orders to the convivial enemy to appear before her. A little way off,
                  the early train was puffing and snorting, making, ready to thunder on its way. We
                  promise you the enemy, awakened overearly from sleep, felt amazed at confronting
                  Miss Hunter, who, from her position on horseback, surveyed him calmly.</p>
               <p>"Sir, I have come to warn you. If you do not make haste somewhere on that train, I
                  will telegraph to the chief of police to come and make your arrest."</p>
               <p>"Arrest me for what?" asked the threatened man.</p>
               <p>"Answer that to yourself," retorted Charlotte. "You know your own record. A man
                  who wears disguises and goes under an alias has reason for the same. I do not care
                  to conceal from you that my only object is to get you out of my brother's way. God
                  will bring you to justice if I let you go. I set the alternative before you. Your
                  sin has found you out. Flee now again, and do not cross Geoffrey's way hereafter,
                  or your days of liberty are few. There is the train, there is the telegraph
                  office. You must go in the one, or I shall make use of the other."</p>
               <p>There was undaunted resolution in Charlotte's eye. She had determined to risk this
                  attack. She felt sure that there was that in this man's past which he feared to
                  meet. If he did not take the alarm and depart, she could at least send for
                  Mr.Alden to search him out. The man looked at her in a desperate scrutiny,
                  watching for the least hint of uncertainty.</p>
               <p>"Two minutes to train time—will you risk staying?"</p>
               <p>No, he dared not risk it. He flung a cloak over his arm, and turned on Charlotte
                  with a fierce oath. It had crossed her mind<pb n="138-139"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000070"/> that he might use a bullet instead; but God had
                  helped her, and he was gone; and as the train whizzed off with the jolly enemy,
                  Charlotte went up to waken her brother, who lay heavy with sleep and wine.
                  Charlotte had learned how to bring Geoffrey back to himself—how to cool and calm
                  his excited brain, to quiet the twitching nerves, to turn truant thoughts into
                  safe channels. She took him home, and the next day, in the fresh, silent room,
                  with breezes stealing through it from the garden, with nothing to disturb or to
                  distract, Charlotte laid all those wearily prepared papers before her restored
                  brother, and left him to work in peace.</p>
               <p>Another week. The wedding was over. Geoffrey was himself again. He cheered the
                  hearts of his parents with promises born of good nature rather than of good
                  intention.</p>
               <p>They went back to New York, and in the few succeeding days Geoffrey was too
                  absolutely busy to turn aside to the devious ways wherein he found pleasure and
                     <emph>social life.</emph> He carried into court the blessed influences of home,
                  of Charlotte's patience, of Oliver Alden's friendship, and never before had he
                  shone so well. His case was won. Would that in that he had won every victory! but
                  of him we must write that now, for this time at least, he lost himself. He
                  celebrated his triumph with his boon companions. The Best Fellow in the World
                  feasted and fêted all the good fellows over whom he ruled. The extravagances in
                  which he indulged, the losses he met, were not even guessed by his anxious
                  sister.</p>
               <p>As for Charlotte, she had told Mr. Alden how she had dealt with Geoffrey's enemy.
                  The detective had found other clues and other evidence, and by means of these a
                  famous forger was brought to justice, and it was clearly proved that he had been
                  feed to divert Geoffrey and destroy his papers, that his client might lose his
                  case.</p>
               <p>The record of the next year is one of folly and sin. The Best Fellow in the World
                  was the slave of strong drink and of dangerous games. Getting drunk, he never got
                     ugly.<pb n="140-141" xml:id="VAC8381-00000071"/> Royally intoxicated, he was
                  elaborately the gentleman, and was in court a brilliant orator, even when he
                  scarcely stood steadily upon his feet.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
               <p>A GREAT part of Charlotte Hunter's strength of character lay in her unlimited
                  hopefulness. Hope gave her courage to work, and gave her also that happy heart
                  that quickly found a compensation for every loss. For Geoffrey, Charlotte, like
                  Gospel-charity, hoped all things, believed all things, suffered long and was kind,
                  bore all things, endured all things, and never failed. She ever felt certain of
                  some ultimate good; was sure that Geoffrey would repent, return from his devious
                  ways, and gain some lofty, eternal good. Toward this future light she was ever
                  looking and pressing: in its radiance the present shadows fled away. Each new
                  effort, every event that occurred, was in some way to bring the coming blessing
                  more near.</p>
               <p>There is nothing to which we cannot in some measure grow accustomed. A constant
                  want, or fear, or pain, or woe seems<pb n="142-143" xml:id="VAC8381-00000072"/> in
                  a manner to fit itself to our enduring. We must not look upon Charlotte as gloomy
                  and miserable over Geoffrey. There was so much in him to admire: love dealt so
                  tenderly with his errors, faith was so blind to many of his sins, he had so much
                  present success in spite of his folly, and was so prodigal of explanations and
                  promises, that Charlotte did not know how to despair.</p>
               <p>The more Geoffrey sinned, the further he went astray, the more did his sister
                  devote herself to him. She magnified his returns to sobriety and industry. She
                  endeavored to become more and more his companion. For his sake, she mingled more
                  in society, and gathered more friends about their home in the University
                  tower.</p>
               <p>All the young lawyer's associates were not men of fashion, pleasure, and
                  dissipation. His brilliant talents drew to him men of kindred abilities, the
                  cultivated Bohemians of the metropolis. From many a queer corner and odd resort
                  they gathered: artists and correspondents, authors and musicians, professional men
                  and whole-hearted students, and a grave, solid set of men, brought by Oliver
                  Alden. These, gathering at times in the third room which Geoffrey had hired in the
                  tower and furnished as a drawing-room, spent bright hours of improvement and
                  enjoyment, where wit and cordiality were unhelped by wine or more harmful
                  beverages.</p>
               <p>Among congenial friends, the brother and sister worked and were happy. And though
                  Geoffrey was continually going astray, Charlotte constantly found some new reason
                  to hope and to expect his complete reformation. "Something would happen," she said
                  often to herself, and sometimes to Oliver Alden. This "something" which she
                  expected was a positive good; but the something that arrived was evil, very
                  evil.</p>
               <p>All unknown to his sister, Geoffrey was grievously burdened with what he called
                  "debts of honor"—a style of debt which, be it remarked, is ever dishonorably
                  incurred. How much he thus owed none but Geoffrey knew—more, certainly, than he
                  could hope to pay, unless, as he said, "something happened<pb n="144-145"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000073"/> pened." Besides these debts, he owed large bills,
                  which Charlotte half-suspected, at hotels and restaurants for suppers and wine
                  parties which he had royally given to all the <figure/> good fellows. Lastly, on
                  this subject, as his sister very well knew, he had been absurdly extravagant in
                  the furnishing of their drawing-room, but this was a bill which she hoped to find
                  means to pay.</p>
               <p>Fred Gay, once Geoffrey's college classmate, had been to California, and in a few
                  years made some twenty-five thousand dollars.</p>
               <p>This young man came to New York, bringing five thousand dollars in a belt with
                  him, and leaving orders with his partners to forward the remainder of his money by
                  express on the news of his arrival. He was a queer fellow, full of eccentricities,
                  one of his notions being that he should die of a sudden attack of fever. He found
                  out Geoffrey and the other good fellows, and they fraternized with him
                  immediately. He had money to spend, and was lavish enough with it, and very likely
                  it would not have taken many months to squander what he had made in a few years,
                  when one day this lively Fred was taken ill, and believed that his worst fears
                  were about to be realized.</p>
               <p>Charlotte was alone in the evening, when a lad from the Astor House came for her
                  brother. Geoffrey was off with his many friends. In an hour the messenger was
                  back.</p>
               <pb n="146-147" xml:id="VAC8381-00000074"/>
               <p>"Indeed, Mr. Gay is very ill, and will take no rest until he sees Mr. Hunter."</p>
               <p>Charlotte gave the boy a list of places where the truant might be found, and about
                  eleven o'clock young Hunter entered his friend's room at the Astor House. Gay
                  banished the attendants who were with him, and, speaking eagerly, said:</p>
               <p>"It's come, Hunter! Just as I always told you."</p>
               <p>"Pooh, pooh! you'll be well in a week, my dear lad!"</p>
               <p>"May be so—yes, I hope so. But, Geof, I've got that money here—the whole twenty
                  thousand—and it's a burden on my mind."</p>
               <p>"Why didn't you take my advice, and deal with the banks like other folks?" asked
                  Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"Didn't I tell you a bank ruined my father? and I've no faith in them," said Gay
                  peevishly.</p>
               <p>"There are chances of loss everywhere," said Geoffrey. "For my part, I think a
                  well-reputed bank very much safer than a man's trunk or a belt about his
                  body."</p>
               <p>"I've got to trust one now," said Gay—"sick, and with so many strangers about me.
                  What I want of you is, to take that twenty thousand, and put it in a bank for me.
                  Choose the best one, I don't know anything about them."</p>
               <p>"But it is too late to-night," said Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"Take it home with you, and attend to it to-morrow. I can't shut my eyes while the
                  money is here. If I live, I'll get it, if the bank don't break; and if I die—you
                  know you drew up a will for me, Geof."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey unlocked his friend's trunk, and took out the pàrcel of money, saying, as
                  he did so:</p>
               <p>"Gay, what a ridiculously inconsistent, unbusiness-like fellow you are! You don't
                  believe in banks; yet here is your fortune in banknotes! Don't trust them, and yet
                  take their paper! Your getting a fortune at all must have been a mere stroke of
                  good luck."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk: I'm sick. There, I feel better already to see you in charge of it,"
                  replied Gay nervously.</p>
               <pb n="148-149" xml:id="VAC8381-00000075"/>
               <p>"All right; I'll give you a line, a receipt for it."</p>
               <p>"No need," said Gay, turning over, and looking up into the kind, handsome face
                  above him—"no need. I'd trust you all the world over, Geoffrey."</p>
               <p>"That may all be," said Geoffrey, opening the writing-desk; "but business is
                  business, my dear friend. And there's the important document; mind you, don't
                  forget where it it is. Now, my boy, get to sleep, and get well. You ain't dead
                  yet, nor anywhere near it. I wish you had a sister like Charlotte to take you in
                  hand, but as you haven't, I commend you to good luck and the doctor."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey shook hands with this friend who would trust him with his all, even to
                  the world's end, and left his room, feeling every way worthy of this
                  confidence.</p>
               <p>It was now one o'clock. The streets were getting quiet, were lonely and deserted
                  most of them. Geoffrey was unfortunately quite used to midnight peregrinations. He
                  went briskly on his way, as he had done many times before; Fred Gay's trust placed
                  securely in the breast-pocket of his coat and guarded by his hand. At the corner
                  of Bleecker and Wooster Streets, the evil one, who was watching for our young
                  friend's ruin, sent two of his subordinates, one of whom sprang at Geoffrey from
                  behind, wound an arm about his neck, and placed a hand over his mouth, while the
                  other dexterously proceeded to rifle him. They had grappled a young athlete who
                  was not to be despised. Geoffrey's first thought was for poor Gay's money, which
                  he would save at the risk of his life if need be. He struck out furiously, freed
                  his mouth, and, while he used feet and fists, lifted up the voice that had
                  thrilled courts and won over juries in a mighty roar for help. By some happy
                  chance, there were two policemen around the corner of Greene Street, who came
                  swiftly to the rescue, and, Geoffrey's watch being broken from the chain and his
                  purse wrenched from his pocket, the assailants grasped Fred Gay's precious package
                  and fled incontinently.</p>
               <pb n="150-151" xml:id="VAC8381-00000076"/>
               <p>"Pursue! pursue! Five hundred dollars to him who catches the thief and my money!
                  I'm robbed!" shouted Geoffrey. And thieves, and policemen, and lawyer rushed madly
                  down Bleecker Street. At this moment Geoffrey's sole thought was to regain the
                  property which had been entrusted to him. His own possessions might go, so he
                  could save poor Fred's treasure. In this frame of mind, he made long strides down
                  Bleecker Street, until, at the corner of Macdougal, he ran into a pile of boxes
                  before a grocery. As, breathless from the encounter with the boxes, he drew back,
                  the topmost one fell from the pile, and something struck his foot. The blow, the
                  fall, the dropping of that something on his boot, took but an instant. The flaring
                  street-lamp at the same moment showed what had fallen to be the packet containing
                  Fred Gay's twenty thousand. The thief had flung it here, expecting to escape and
                  recover it himself or to send some of his confederates to secure the prize.
                  Strange that, as Geoffrey, the Best Fellow in the World, the man whom poor Fred
                  would trust anywhere, and who believed himself quite worthy of that trust, stooped
                  to regain this money, the shameful thought came to him that here was means to
                  defray those dishonorable debts of honor, and set him free! He saw the recovered
                  money—rejoicing for Fred; he took it up—for himself. So sudden his temptation and
                  his fall! He put the parcel in his bosom. He followed swiftly the steps of the
                  robbers and the policemen, and finally found the latter coming back. They had lost
                  their men near Greenwich Street. Geoffrey accompanied them to the station, gave an
                  account of the attack and the loss, and what description of the thieves he could.
                  A newspaper reporter, on the lookout for items, quickly got up one about
                  Geoffrey's adventure, and rushed off to get it into type for the morning
                  edition.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey went home to Charlotte, and told his misadventure, and, strangely enough,
                  rose early in the morning to send word to Fred Gay's attendant not to admit the
                  daily papers to the sick-room, lest the account of the loss should make the
                  patient worse!</p>
               <pb n="152-153" xml:id="VAC8381-00000077"/>
               <p>How strong soever a man may be in his honorable principles, there is no estimating
                  how shamefully he may fall if he has not divine grace to hold him up. Geoffrey had
                  been losing money that evening, and drinking freely of brandy to console him for
                  his loss. Perhaps the poison had driven him mad. Had this good fellow, this
                  emphatically <emph>best</emph> fellow, ever believed that, given such strange
                  opportunity, he could rob his confiding friend?</p>
               <p>The story was in everybody's mouth. It rang—its changes and its sequel known only
                  to himself—through Geoffrey's brain. Ah! the wine and the brandy he poured down
                  his throat that day to drown in the fiery stream that accusing conscience which
                  was so hard to kill.</p>
               <p>While Charlotte, possessed with hearty sympathy for the sick Gay, was alert for
                  the recovery of his money—while this friend condoled with Geoffrey over his
                  losses, and that one admired his pluck, and a third wondered that he had not been
                  murdered, the package of money lay heavy, hidden in Geoffrey's bosom still, and he
                  drank again and again, and thought he could now be rid of those debts of honor
                  owed to the jolly good fellows by the best and jolliest of the crew.</p>
               <p>While Oliver Alden was trying to find out the thieves and recover what was lost,
                  and the first excitement was dying out, Fred Gay, from being ill, grew worse, and
                  from worse got better. Geoffrey had not visited him. He sent word to Fred that he
                  feared the infection of fever; he told Charlotte that he could not face the poor
                  fellow, yet ignorant of his loss. Meanwhile he went over and over the facts: he
                  had accepted a trust; he had indubitably been robbed, every one knew that; there
                  was no blame to him; and here he had the money that had been stolen, and he would
                  not face the fact that he had become a thief; but he drank harder and harder, and
                  began to pay the debts for which he was relentlessly persecuted by some of the
                  good fellows who had been so very good until they had become his creditors, and
                  were now so many Shylocks demanding their pounds of flesh.</p>
               <pb n="154-155" xml:id="VAC8381-00000078"/>
               <p>Geoffrey began to pay these debts—not honest bills for furniture and suppers,
                  foolishly incurred bills, to be sure, they were—but he paid the shady debts,
                  contracted in shady places, to a set of sharpers and blacklegs who had seemed such
                  exceedingly friendly and jolly fellows while they played their cheating games. He
                  paid the money out thus by degrees during several weeks, while Alden was looking
                  after the robbery and many other matters, and Fred Gay kept getting well.</p>
               <p>As Charlotte had once told that convivial forger, God would find him out and bring
                  him to judgment, even if she let him go, so now God pointed at Geoffrey with an
                  unerring finger; pointed him out as a villain, when Geoffrey thought he had just
                  got conscience stupefied, and was thus sitting quietly at home. It was a cold
                  evening, and there was a fire in the grate in the little parlor, and Oliver Alden,
                  Charlotte, and Geoffrey were sitting before it in all apparent comfort, when
                  Providence, with such visible hand as wrote on Babylonish palace-walls, dragged
                  ged Geoffrey's sin to light. Geoffrey sat before the fire, Alden and Charlotte
                  facing each other on either side of him. Alden was thinking of Charlotte, but
                  Charlotte was thinking of Gay's loss. She looked over to Alden.</p>
               <p>"Do you think you are ever going to get a clue to those thieves, and recover that
                  money?"</p>
               <p>"I hope so," said Alden, and added, as an item of his experience, "I have
                  frequently found most light by searching out those whom one would be least likely
                  to suspect."</p>
               <p>"Why, then," said Charlotte carelessly, and her confident eye sought Alden's, "I
                  think you must begin with Geoffrey—<emph>my</emph> Geoffrey!"</p>
               <p>The fearful spell of sin was broken; Charlotte's clear, sweet voice smote on her
                  guilty brother's ears like the voice of the resurrection angel. As Charlotte and
                  Alden looked at each other, they saw Geoffrey's face between them, its fashion
                  changed in one instant, not by indignation, but by guilt. His countenance was
                  blanched and convulsed<pb n="156-157" xml:id="VAC8381-00000079"/> vulsed; his eyes
                  were full of horror; his jaw had fallen; cold drops of sweat rolled over his face;
                  his knees shook together. His sin had found him out; vengeance unspeakable had
                  overtaken him; his eyes were opened; he saw the amazing depth where he had fallen;
                  conscience awoke like a strong man armed.</p>
               <p>Charlotte read the story of her twin-brother's crime. Every trace of color faded
                  out of her face. Her breath came heavily. She looked at Alden, and saw he also
                  read this record. She gave him an imploring glance, which he, who had studied all
                  her moods, so well understood. He must leave them. She could not bear a witness to
                  Geoffrey's degradation.</p>
               <p>He rose to go. As his hand touched the door, Charlotte gave a little cry. He
                  turned; she could not speak, but he knew what her eyes asked, and he answered with
                  a look. He would not divulge this secret. For the present it was safe.</p>
               <p>He was gone.</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey!" cried Charlotte—"Geoffrey!" shaking his arm—"Geoffrey, speak to me!
                     <emph>You</emph> have this money! <emph>You</emph> have committed this crime!
                  Rouse up, and tell me about it. I must save you yet, <emph>my</emph>
                  Geoffrey!"</p>
               <p>Her Geoffrey still! Here was a love which could not abandon him—which reached down
                  into the black pit of his despair and wicked treachery, with an angel's strength
                  to try and lift him upward.</p>
               <p>As often before in hours of lesser import, and as he never should again, Geoffrey
                  turned to find refuge in his sister's loving strength. Never again shall the old
                  University hold two such bruised and wounded hearts as ached that night, when
                  Geoffrey laid before this sister the ungarnished story of his temptation and his
                  fall.</p>
               <p>"There, now, you know it all, and there's an end of everything for me, Charley,"
                  said Geoffrey forlornly.</p>
               <p>"Oh! no; I hope not. We must save you yet, Geof," said Charlotte, stroking, with
                  yearning tenderness, the bright hair she had pulled so often when her partnership
                  and Geoffrey's concerned only a wicker cradle.</p>
               <pb n="158-159" xml:id="VAC8381-00000080"/>
               <p>"Do what you can, Charley, to keep disgrace from you and the rest of the folks.
                  It's no matter for me any more."</p>
               <p>"Yes, it is, Geoffrey. I will do for you only what is fair and honest, and you can
                  take a new start, and start right, this time."</p>
               <p>"I'll agree to anything you say, Charley," said Geoffrey. And Charlotte from this
                  took heart of grace, and believed that all would yet be well.</p>
               <p>It was no time now to set this man's sins in order and claim his vows. The night
                  was passing away. Charlotte took her Bible, and read the Fifty-first Psalm. Then
                  the two knelt, and Geoffrey listened humbly enough while his sister besought for
                  him forgiveness and a broken and contrite heart. Indeed, this gray, chill morning,
                  that was even now wanly looking in at the tower window, seemed for them the dawn
                  of better days.</p>
               <p>There was no need to ask Charlotte where she was going when she early attired
                  herself for walking. Geoffrey sat by a table, his head bowed on his folded arms;
                  close by his elbow lay that fatal packet of money. Alas! that the seals were
                  broken! Charlotte took it.</p>
               <p>"Twelve thousand here, Geoffrey?"</p>
               <p>"Yes. But count it and see. No trusting <emph>me</emph> again."</p>
               <p>"Don't talk that way, my boy. You have repented, Geof. Ask forgiveness for
                  yourself, and then go down to your office and get to work. I'll find you there.
                  The business is behind-hand, and we have a case coming up to-morrow."</p>
               <p>Fred Gay was sitting up, convalescent, in his wrapper, comfortable; had just
                  breakfasted. He was glad to see Charlotte, who had called on him several times
                  during his illness.</p>
               <p>With some brief preparation Charlotte began her story, recounting the robbery and
                  the loss. Fred's face grew blank and gray, as what man's would not who had lost
                  his all? But he was young and hopeful, and, oh! so happy that he had not died of
                  the fever. Life was strong in him yet. And he said huskily, with an effort at
                  cheerfulness:</p>

               <p>"Well, I must go back, and make my little fortune over again."</p>
               <p>This patience cut Charlotte to the heart. She had now what was so much worse to
                  tell. She flushed crimson, and then grew pale, and covered her face with her hand
                  as she told the rest—that Geoffrey had been false. She did not tell that she had
                  urged Geoffrey to come and make this confession himself; that he—pity for that too
                  soft nature—had said he <emph>could not do it.</emph> He could not thus pain his
                  friend, and meet his anger and his sorrow.</p>
               <p>"There," said Charlotte, taking the parcel, "is your money—what is left—twelve
                  thousand dollars. I implore your patience; I can promise to pay you five thousand
                  dollars within a fortnight, and I will give you my note for the remaining three,
                  with Uncle Ames as my security. My brother is at your mercy. I beg you will not
                  expose this grievous sin, committed, I believe, under the influence of liquor.
                  Give him this other opportunity to lift himself up and be a man. I hope he will
                  not again disappoint your confidence."</p>
               <p>"Miss Hunter," said Fred, more shocked and compassionate than he could express, "I
                  will not expose your brother if I never get another cent. As to security, I need
                  none better than your promise" (here Fred was reckless and trusting as ever); "and
                  you shake hands with Geof for me, and tell him to go in and win as a man ought
                  with such a sister."</p>
               <p>Fred seized Charlotte's hand and shook it violently.</p>
               <p>"I hope you won't distress yourself over this affair, ma'am. I dare say, it will
                  all come out right. Anyway, you couldn't help it. And it's wonderful what
                  mischief—if you'll excuse me, what infernal mischief—that drink cuts up. I've a
                  mind to say I'll never touch it again."</p>
               <p>The first ray of light that had brightened Charlotte's face since she learned
                  Geoffrey's defection shot into it now.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Gay, if I thought by Geoffrey's shame and sin, your soul, any soul, could be
                  saved from the power of this curse—strong drink—comfort might begin to spring out
                  of sorrow."</p>
               <pb n="162-163" xml:id="VAC8381-00000082"/>
               <p>She had risen when he shook her hand, and stood looking down at him, with wistful
                  entreaty in the face which loving, and hoping, and caring had touched with the
                  loftiest beauty.</p>
               <p>"Some learn by others' misfortunes, some by their own," said Fred Gay, whom the
                  recent near approach of death had in a measure subdued. "I pledge myself to you,
                  never to taste again anything that can intoxicate, and I hope to be a better man
                  from this hour."</p>
               <p>Here was an omen of good, and the day grew brighter to Charlotte as she went back
                  to Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>Oliver Alden was in the office, and the two were talking in low, earnest tones
                  when Charlotte entered. Geoffrey had evidently revealed the whole affair to his
                  friend, and Charlotte made therefore no scruple of telling all that had passed at
                  Fred Gay's.</p>
               <p>"Fred's a noble fellow," said Geoffrey; "and as for you, Charley, the world
                  doesn't hold your equal. If you think me worth your cares, I'll try again, for
                  your sake; and here I promise you that I'll never gamble again, never touch a
                  card, nor go near a billiard-table, for your sake, Charley, and here's my hand on
                  it."</p>
               <p>"Any other promise, Geoffrey?" asked Charlotte, taking his hand. But a step was
                  heard in the hall, and Charlotte passed into the inner office, and went to work.
                  Geoffrey worked feverishly all day. He was in a state of high excitement. Intense
                  relief contended with horror, shame, and remorse. Charlotte knew that the reaction
                  would come, when Geoffrey, all crushed and unstrung, would go down into abject
                  despair.</p>
               <p>She stood at the foot of the stairs while Geoffrey was locking up the office.
                  Oliver Alden came by. "I am going away," said Charlotte. "I must be absent about
                  ten days, for matters that cannot be trusted to the mail. May I leave Geoffrey
                  with you? Will you watch him, encourage him, and urge him to honest work?"</p>
               <p>Said Alden, "You could not ask me anything which I should refuse. What man can do
                  for your brother, you may look to me for."</p>
               <pb n="164-165" xml:id="VAC8381-00000083"/>
               <p>That evening Geoffrey and Charlotte talked of her absence. Of course it was to
                  raise money to make up for his fraud. Geoffrey could not go, for he found it just
                  as impossible to face the disappointment and distress which he had occasioned at
                  home, as to meet Fred Gay. He could not very well have accompanied Charlotte, for
                  there were important cases on hand, and, if this firm was to live through these
                  troubles, it must be by diligent attention to business, and by keeping recent
                  missteps to themselves.</p>
               <p>"Now, Geof," said Charlotte, "I want you to cut loose from all these idle
                  pleasure-seekers, and keep steadily at work while I am gone. You must give your
                  attention to retrieving what you have lost."</p>
               <p>"I wish work could kill recollection," said Geoffrey gloomily.</p>
               <p>"I don't; let past experiences and falls serve as warnings for the future. You
                  have pledged yourself to stop gaming: pledge yourself now to absolute
                  temperance."</p>
               <p>"Why, Charlotte, it was play, not drink, that got me into trouble."</p>
               <p>"It was drink that led you to play; and I <emph>know,</emph> Geof that, if you had
                  been <emph>sober,</emph> you would not have taken the means you did to free
                  yourself from debt."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey shuddered.</p>
               <p>"I want your pledge, Geof," said his sister.</p>
               <p>"Charlotte, I'll promise to abstain from drink, <emph>if I can.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"If you <emph>can?</emph> Why, Geoffrey, by God's help, you can do anything."</p>
               <p>"God seems a great way off—further than he used in the old times, Charley; so far
                  off that I cannot find him or feel his helping."</p>
               <p>Oh! the infinite sadness of this commentary on "Remember <emph>now</emph> thy
                  Creator!" How nigh had he been in the college-days of grace, when Charlotte had
                  laid hold on the Covenant Angel!</p>
               <p>"God is helping you, Geoffrey," spoke Charlotte. "If you turn to him, he can bring
                  good out of this evil."</p>
               <p>Charlotte set out for home next day. All the journey she was planning how she
                  could unfold her story to the dear old parents. At<pb n="166-167"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000084"/> last, when safely within the shelter of home,
                  welcomed, caressed, protected, once more, the strong Charlotte broke down into
                  weeping; and how she uttered the tale she never knew. On through the night ran the
                  Happy River, carrying the dead leaves of October beneath the stars, and still
                  those sleepless parents heard its flow.</p>
               <p>Charlotte had no time for delays. Next morning she saw the kind old father,
                  standing alone by the fence, looking off vaguely into the distance. Something
                  lonely and hopeless in his attitude told her that he was thinking of his only son.
                  She went out to him, put her arm about his neck. "Father, I want my marriage
                  portion."</p>
               <p>"For what, my daughter?" But well the old man knew.</p>
               <p>"You gave Eva five thousand dollars, father, and said you had as much for me—the
                  savings you and mother made for years. Give it to me now, father; I will never ask
                  it again."</p>
               <p>"And with this you will—?"</p>
               <p>"Pay so much that is owing to Fred Gay. It is better that debt and
                     <emph>such</emph> debt should be paid, father, than to have money in the bank.
                  You know I would do that much for my Geoffrey, dear father."</p>
               <p>"And what will you do, my daughter?" asked the proud and sad old man.</p>
               <p>"Be my own portion when the time comes," said Charlotte, smiling through her
                  tears; for this was such a miserable conversation, having such a sad occasion.</p>
               <p>"I don't know as it is right to allow you to sacrifice so much for Geoffrey,
                  Charlotte."</p>
               <p>"It is not so much of a sacrifice as to see him go down unhelped. I feel sure that
                  Geoffrey will do better and become all that we have hoped. It is, after all, just
                  the liveliness and kindness of his disposition that have led him astray. He always
                  was such a good fellow, father."</p>
               <p>There were no secrets in the Hunter family. Affairs of the household were
                  discussed openly, and what Charlotte designed was soon fully explained.</p>
               <p>"You're not called upon to do it at all.<pb n="168-169" xml:id="VAC8381-00000085"
                  /> It was a great shame of Geof. I hope he'll turn over a new leaf now. But I
                  don't think you ought to rob yourself or involve father," said Eva.</p>
               <p>"It is all right about myself, and I won't let father meet loss through either of
                  us," replied Charlotte.</p>
               <p>George, Eva's husband, muttered something about his being sorry enough, hoping all
                  would come out right, and that there were few such sisters as Charlotte. The
                  mother hid both pair of spectacles in her pocket, and looked at her daughter with
                  all her heart in her eyes.</p>
               <p>When Charlotte concluded her brief visit, she took with her a check for the money
                  her parents had held sacred as her marriage portion. She had another visit still.
                  She must go to Uncle Ames. It was a hard duty, but Charlotte felt that she and
                  Geoffrey could not go on unaided. She needed her uncle's name at least.</p>
               <p>Having obtained that, and a plenty of hearty sympathy, which was very comforting,
                  Charlotte set out for New York, feeling that now her hope lay in finding Geoffrey
                  at work, honest in his efforts to amend. If Geoffrey would be temperate and
                  industrious, all would be well. Business was good; before the world, the
                  reputation of the firm was unsullied. She expected Geoffrey to meet her at the
                  depot, but Mr. Alden came instead. He had a carriage waiting. Charlotte's heart
                  failed her: she knew there was something wrong. Suspense was cruelty, and Mr.
                  Alden, as kindly as he could, told her the truth. Geoffrey had seemed in a frenzy
                  of shame and despair. He said he could not work; he could not enter court; he
                  could not meet his friends; he was a hopeless villain of the deepest dye; and, as
                  if to make good his words, he had done little but drink since Charlotte left him,
                  and was even now intoxicated. He had offended several of his clients by his
                  failure to attend to their cases, and declared that he neither could nor would
                  touch a case again. He said he wanted to do better, but he could not.</p>
               <p>"The fact is," said Mr. Alden, "the poor<pb n="170-171" xml:id="VAC8381-00000086"
                  /> fellow seems to have lost control over himself. It is a mania—a disease."</p>
               <p>"So I have heard Doctor Gray say," replied Charlotte.</p>
               <p>"And if a disease, it must be within the range of medical treatment."</p>
               <p>"So Doctor Gray said," repeated Charlotte. "He looked at drunkenness with a
                  physician's eyes, and said he could cure it like many of the other diseases to
                  which we are subject."</p>
               <p>"As far as I see," said Mr. Alden, "you might as well break up this establishment.
                  Your brother is of no use in his present state, and the first thing is to get him
                  cured. If he is once well—sound in mind and body—he can build up a business again.
                  To go on as he has the last few weeks is simple ruin."</p>
               <p>They had reached the University, and Charlotte went in alone.</p>
               <p>The next morning Geoffrey had come to himself, and his sister told him what she
                  had been doing.</p>
               <p>"You have been working for me, and I have been doing the worst I could. I see it—I
                  feel it. Charlotte, I detest myself, and yet there seems some fearful spell upon
                  me. All at once, I find that I am no longer master of myself."</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey," said Charlotte, "will you <emph>try</emph> to be cured? Will you go to
                  Doctor Gray, put yourself under his care, obey his orders, and let him master this
                  appetite for you?"</p>
               <p>Here was a gleam of hope.</p>
               <p>"Charlotte, if you will agree to my cutting loose from this old life, with all its
                  reminders, and starting all new when I begin again, I'll do it. I feel as if I
                  loathed this profession which once I loved so well. I see myself in every criminal
                  in the dock. If you'll agree to sell out, close up here, and, when I am myself
                  again, bid me God-speed in some other line of life, I'll try my best. I believe I
                  shall be fit for something, Charlotte."</p>
               <p>Mr. Alden was present, and he sided with Geoffrey's view, and offered to aid
                  Charlotte in closing up. The leases of the rooms and office, the furniture, and
                  the library were valuable, and he thought he knew of a quarter<pb n="172-173"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000087"/> ter where he could get a fair price for them.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey, who had once been so energetic and manly, was now by intemperance and
                  mental pain reduced to uselessness. Charlotte must do everything. He could not see
                  anybody—could not talk with anybody. Charlotte must go and talk with Doctor Gray,
                  and Charlotte must wind up their business. All they could rouse him to do was to
                  empower Charlotte to do everything.</p>
               <p>"I will see Doctor Gray to-morrow," said Charlotte, "and can be back here early
                  the day after. If he is willing to take charge of your cure, will you go there
                  with me?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Charley," said Geoffrey feebly. "I'll do anything which you want me to."</p>
               <p>Again Charlotte began to hope. Here was surely the first step to reformation.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey flung himself on the lounge and went to sleep. Tears came into
                  Charlotte's eyes as she marked the ravages made in his face and figure by that one
                  fatal habit. What a wreck was this well-beloved Geoffrey!</p>
               <p>And this dear little home, where they had often been so happy, and that business
                  wherein they had embarked so many hopes, all must be given up. Intemperance had
                  scuttled their ship and sunk them irretrievably. Such a lonesome look came over
                  poor Charlotte as she made mental inventory of all that she was losing.</p>
               <p>"Charlotte," said Mr. Alden, "will you tell me how you raised that five thousand
                  which you paid Gay, this morning?"</p>
               <p>He was not used to call her Charlotte, but he was too good a friend for her to
                  take umbrage at that or at his question. She replied with the simple truth that
                  her father had set the sum aside as her marriage portion, and she had asked it of
                  him now.</p>
               <p>"It is hardly needful to tell you," said Mr. Alden, "that I believe you a woman
                  better and nobler than all others, and that I by no means esteem myself the best
                  of men. But, despite all that, I wish that you would take me for what I am, and
                  give yourself to me for ever, Charlotte."</p>
               <pb n="174-175" xml:id="VAC8381-00000088"/>
               <p>Here was a man whom she had learned to believe in—a man who had loved her without
                  making love in set form. She dared not trust herself to question how she might
                  feel towards him, but quickly made answer, "No; if I forsake Geoffrey now, he will
                  never try any more. If he thinks I care for any one more than for him, and am
                  deserting him, he will give up and be ruined."</p>
               <p>"But do you not care for some other more than for Geoffrey?"</p>
               <p>"I have never measured my love for Geoffrey," said Charlotte.</p>
               <p>Mr. Alden took courage as she did not deny his implication: "Shall I wait, then,
                  until Geoffrey is on his feet again?"</p>
               <p>"You must do what will make you happiest," said Charlotte, with a smile.</p>
               <p>"I always enjoyed waiting," observed Oliver Alden.</p>
               <p>On the second day after that, when Charlotte came back from Dr. Gray's, thinking
                  she had settled affairs there for Geoffrey, and assured him a home and a cure, she
                  found that, after violently breaking away from Alden, poor Geoffrey had got
                  intoxicated and disappeared.</p>
               <p>"He has left town," said Mr. Alden, "and I think he has gone home. Some longing
                  for his friends and for peace may have seized him. You had better leave your
                  business in my hands and go after him."</p>

               <p>IT was Tony Moreland who had been to the depot for two of those naughty barrels
                  whereby his Aunt Katy made her living, and who now rolled them into the curious,
                  scientific, and beer-selling shop, settling them in their places with an
                  expressive kick. Says Master Tony:</p>
               <p>"Haunt Katy, hi seed Miss Charlotte hat the depot, hand she's got more'n ha peck
                  hof trouble, I knows. She looked horful. Mr. George was there 'long with the
                  kerrige. She goes to 'im, hand hasks somethin', lookin' like folks do wen they
                  hasks to see the corp'. Mr. George shakes 'is 'ead. She looked round, done out
                  like, then she comes hup to me. Says she, tryin' to speak keerless like: 'Tony,
                  'ave you seen Mr. Geoffrey?' 'No, miss,' says I. Then she gets hinto the kerrige,
                  hand I knows she's gone hand lost Mr. Geoffrey—"</p>
               <p>"Is <emph>that</emph> all?" asks Katy, disappointed in the unsatisfactory
                  termination of this gossip.</p>
               <p>"No, 'tain't hall. Hit's my hopinion that whiskey his hat the bottom hof 'er
                  trouble, whatsohever hit his. Hi say, likevise hi've said many's the time, Haunt
                  Katy, wish't you quit the business, hor some night hi'm bound to rise hup hand
                  knock the bungs into the 'oles hof hevery 'un hof them dumb hold bar'ls."</p>
               <p>"Dumb" being the nearest approach Tony ever made to swearing, he had now reached
                  his climax, and, taking a cloth of indifferent color, began to mop off the
                  counter, wet with a filthy drizzle of ale, beer, and brandy from dirty mugs and
                  tumblers.</p>
               <p>"I'm sure," says Aunt Katy, "I'd be sorry for any trouble coming to that young
                  lady and gentleman. I'd go a longer way to pleasure them than any others. Look out
                  for that owl, Tony; you'll knock him over!"</p>
               <p>"That howl's for ever in the way," grunted Tony.</p>
               <p>"I wish, Tony, you'd brush off that squirrel a little."</p>
               <pb n="178-179" xml:id="VAC8381-00000090"/>
               <p>"That here squirrel's stood round hin the dust so long, 'e looks 'bout has seedy
                  has Huncle Terry," said Tony.</p>
               <p>Ten o'clock. The night was dark and chill. The green branches were gone from Aunt
                  Katy's fireplace, and bright flames sparkled there instead. Uncle Terry, crouched
                  in the corner of the settle, sipping beer or brandy, made a feeble attempt to be
                  jovial, and, complaining of the sweeping winds and darksome roads, would not be
                  gone. Aunt Katy dozed over her knitting; Tony read a dog's-eared book. Some one is
                  knocking at the door.</p>
               <p>Who comes here? Not the famous Grenadier of nursery story, but a tall figure, in a
                  fashionably-made brown cloth suit, with a handsome overcoat and travelling-cap.
                  The glossy brown locks and beard are damp and unkempt. There is a wildness in the
                  eyes, and some great sorrow, remorse, and sin have stamped uncanny lines on cheek
                  and brow. There is a treacherous tremble to the voice once so sweet and true; but
                  air and speech are a touching echo of the debonair nair, elate, and right royal
                  King of all Good Fellows. It is Geoffrey Hunter.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Mrs. Moreland—Tony, my friend—and Uncle Terry, too"—that courteous bow all
                  around, that lifts them up to the plane of the Best Fellow in the World, he so
                  thoroughly treats them as his peers—"I'm late, to-night. I'll have to trouble you
                  for a seat by your fire, Mrs. Moreland. It is too late to travel in the dark."</p>
               <p>How eagerly does Katy bring her best chair, and humbly take his coat and hat, and
                  feel her poor home all unworthy of its guest! Tony replenished the fire. His eyes
                  were keen as his hunter uncle's had been, and in those muddy boots, in the burrs,
                  and dead leaves, and hooked briers caught in these fine clothes, Tony read a story
                  of aimless wanderings, that weariness and cold had ended, and which this poor
                  gentleman was vainly striving to hide. Then the boy's cautious eye travelled up to
                  the worn face, and to the eyes gazing so drearily into the fire. The way in which
                  Tony put facts and signs together and made out the wanderer's<pb n="180-181"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000091"/> derer's story, was quite worthy of Oliver
                  Alden.</p>
               <p>Katy had already gone to her counter and was filling a glass. Tony went after her,
                  took her by the elbow, and spoke in low, rapid tones:</p>
               <p>"For shame, haunt! I thought better hof you. To give ha <emph>gentleman</emph>
                  that cheap stuff made for paupers like Huncle Terry! Can't you see the gentleman's
                  sick? 'E's cold hand faint; hout hof 'is 'ead like, going into brain-fever most
                  like. Now, you <emph>can</emph> make good coffee; so give 'im a cup hof that, all
                  'ot hand good, hand treat 'im like a Christian."</p>
               <p>"That's what I aim to do, Tony," said Katy with dignity, offended, yet convinced.
                  "He is sick or wrong somehow, sure enough, and I'll make the coffee."</p>
               <p>The two turned to look at their guest, who, unheeding their whispers, crouched
                  over the fire and spread his hands to the blaze.</p>
               <p>Uncle Terry had concluded his potations and taken the same position on the other
                  side of the hearth. There they sat—the Good Fellow and the Royally Best
                  Fellow—different degrees of the same comparison; but for such stuff as gurgled in
                  Katy's barrels, they might have both been something so different—the one, the
                  honest, respectable village patriarch; the other, a leader among men by the divine
                  right of the great gifts Heaven had bestowed upon him.</p>
               <p>Katy went to make her coffee, and Tony brushed Geoffrey's clothes, took away the
                  travel-stained boots, and brought a cushion whereon to rest his feet.</p>
               <p>"Come, now, uncle, it's time you made tracks," he said, crowding Uncle Terry's hat
                  on his head and twisting his scarf about his neck. But the old man only mumbled
                  and tottered, and would not go.</p>
               <p>"Uncle Terry seems rather shaky," said Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"Well, 'e's just where 'e might look to be hafter 'is guzzling—gone to the dogs!
                  Nothin' like drinkin' to pull a man down, hand break 'im hup, hand work the
                  mischief with 'im generally. Well, Uncle Terry!<pb n="182-183"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000092"/> hi've poured hout your ruin many's ha time, not hof
                  my hown free will, tho'. So hi'll bear the brunt of it, hand take you 'ome. Peg
                  along lively, now!"</p>
               <p>Tony took the forlorn old victim off, and, presently returning, wiped the settle
                  with elaborate care, brought a clean quilt and pillow, decorations of Katy's
                  ever-unused state-bed, and Geoffrey, having drunk the coffee and expressed his
                  thanks, stretched himself out on the rest thus prepared, and fell away to
                  sleep.</p>
               <p>"He looks fearsome bad, poor gentleman, and as you say, Tony, he's sick and
                  wandering like. He's worked too hard and worn hisself out. As soon as it's
                  morning, I'll run up to the farm, and tell Miss Hunter to bring the carriage for
                  him."</p>
               <p>Early in the morning, so early that the daylight had not quenched the stars, Katy
                  was making ready to go on her errand. The new blue stockings were gartered over
                  the sturdy legs that made nothing of a six miles' walk; Katy's best red petticoat
                  was carefully held up from brushing against the brown earth or the rime of frost;
                  over Katy's shoulders and head was drawn the ample bright-blue cloth cloak, which
                  had done duty in Ireland before she went to England, and in England before she
                  came to America; the hood of the cloak covered the clean frilled cap, tied with a
                  broad black ribbon which Katy wore as a token of her widow-hood.</p>
               <p>Away she went, frost-stiffened grass and leaves crackling beneath her feet; away
                  in the stinging morning air, the early sunrise flaming against her face—kind,
                  honest, foolish, misguided Katy Moreland; doing strange mixture of good and evil
                  all the days of her life. I think an angel with any less welcome message would not
                  have been so warmly greeted at the Hunter farm as was the taxidermist's widow when
                  she came bringing news of Geoffrey. Doubly thankful was Charlotte when she found
                  that her brother was only supposed to be ill from overwork. The carriage was made
                  ready with pillows, hot bricks, and soft, warm Afghans, while mother Hunter in her
                     gratitude<pb n="184-185" xml:id="VAC8381-00000093"/> tude prepared Katy's
                  breakfast, and served her with her own hands as an honored guest. Blessed and
                  never-to-be-forgotten hour to Mistress Katy when she drank Mocha coffee from a
                  transparent cup, ate buckwheat cakes and broiled ham with a silver fork, and saw a
                  fringed damask napkin lying by her own plate, when to crown all she rode home with
                  Miss Charlotte in the carriage!</p>
               <p>Whatever had been the indignation of the Hunter family at Geoffrey's wayward and
                  wicked course, it was short-lived. It had vanished in that one night of anxiety
                  when he was wandering they knew not where. When Katy brought news of him, they
                  were prepared to receive their prodigal with unquestioning, unrebuking love; to
                  put on him the best robe and the ring; and make a feast of gladness over his
                  return. Geoffrey, ill in mind and body, penitent and exhausted, came home with a
                  great longing for that home's peace and love. Upon his perturbed spirit the gentle
                  ministries of his friends fell like dew from heaven. He was wrapped in a profound
                  calm. The tumult, bustle, and strife of the great city had died away like the
                  echoes of battle. Temptations were gone; foes and flatterers were gone. Here were
                  no cases to win or lose, no courts to plead before, no juries to persuade. The
                  excitement, the success, the sin and sorrow of the past, fled like dream-land
                  shadows, and slowly through the beautiful Indian-summer days Geoffrey came back to
                  himself—came to renewal of hope and strength. He had been mad, but now was sane.
                  He wondered at himself; at his recent conduct; at the love which had borne with
                  him. Of that love he would at last prove worthy. Again, these may have been days
                  of mercy when God was waiting to be gracious. Having no suits to plead on earth,
                  why did not Geoffrey now retain in his behalf that Eternal Advocate who waits ever
                  to plead in the court of the Father? This is an advocate who never loses a case;
                  who never turns off a client; who asks no fee but a love which he himself gives us
                  to feel.</p>
               <pb n="186-187" xml:id="VAC8381-00000094"/>
               <p>Able now to hope and plan for himself, Geoffrey took an interest in the settlement
                  of his affairs in New York, and in going to Doctor Gray. Mr. Alden, acting as his
                  agent, disposed of his property in the city, paid the furniture bill, and an
                  additional three hundred to Fred Gay.</p>
               <p>It was neither Geoffrey's plan nor the doctor's that he should be idle in his new
                  home. Activity and mental occupation were means to the cure. Geoffrey was to set
                  in order Dr. Gray's accounts, teach the Greek classes in the academy, and be the
                  librarian of the village association. Charlotte had feared to have her brother
                  take the journey to Doctor Gray alone, lest he be again tempted by his evil habit.
                  She hesitated to propose to accompany him, lest he should construe it as suspicion
                  and watching. Quite unexpectedly Oliver Alden made his appearance, and, after a
                  short visit, became Geoffrey's travelling companion.</p>
               <p>"Why don't you marry that man, Lottie, I know he wants you?" said Eva.</p>
               <p>Charlotte laughed. She felt so light-hearted hearted, now that Geoffrey was to be
                  safe, and the burden of care for him was lifted from her tired spirit.</p>
               <p>"I suppose you'll settle down at home, now, and behave as a young lady should,"
                  said Eva, assuming matronly airs. "I'm glad of it, you have been so singular,
                  Lottie."</p>
               <p>"You are doomed to disappointment, my dear," said Charlotte. "I shall be off in
                  two weeks; would be gone to-morrow, did not civilized humanity demand such a
                  variety of garments."</p>
               <p>"Where are you going, and what for?" demanded Eva.</p>
               <p>"To Uncle Ames's, to be his clerk, on a salary of eight hundred dollars; and he is
                  to let me live at his house besides. I shall scribble enough at least to make my
                  earnings a thousand; and I hope to save half I earn."</p>
               <p>Charlotte knew she was horrifying her sister by these utterances, and she laughed
                  heartily.</p>
               <p>"How I do hate to hear a woman talk of earning money!" cried Eva; "it looks so
                  unladylike."</p>
               <pb n="188-189" xml:id="VAC8381-00000095"/>
               <p>"I've just as good a right to earn my living as a man, provided I know how," said
                  Charlotte, ventilating her old creed.</p>
               <p>"You sound dreadfully avaricious," said Eva. "But, if you are going to be at Uncle
                  Ames's, you'll need bushels of new clothes, they're so fashionable."</p>
               <p>Eva spoke with satisfaction; she doted on new clothes.</p>
               <p>"Clerks are not expected to be stylish,' said Charlotte. "But I shall be thankful
                  for your advice in remodelling my old garments, and making them whole and decent.
                  Considering my circumstances, I think it a blessing that I have no prettiness as
                  you have to set off with nice clothes."</p>
               <p>Eva took a peep in the glass at her beauty, which ever grew more beautiful in her
                  eyes, and, indeed, in everybody's eyes, and then set about giving her elder sister
                  aid and advice in her sewing.</p>
               <p>And now for the first time the paths of this twin brother and sister diverged and
                  ran far apart—they were separated by Geoffrey's sin. Charlotte's hopes and plans
                  were changed, in a measure. Geoffrey had said that he should never resume the
                  practice of law. He felt that it would for ever call up his sin, and he could not
                  face either judge or prisoner, knowing how he himself had fallen. Geoffrey, with
                  an aptitude for nearly everything, with an easy versatility of talent which could
                  take hold of almost any occupation or profession, would choose for himself some
                  new line of life, and be quite sure of succeeding, unless he relapsed into
                  intemperance. With Charlotte it was very different. She could assist Geoffrey
                  while he was a lawyer; if he chose teaching as a profession, she could help him in
                  that; in any other course she could not stand with him shoulder to shoulder as
                  heretofore. After her bitter disappointment and despair, Charlotte had come to
                  feel that she should be quite satisfied if she found Geoffrey doing well, living a
                  moral and happy life, even if that life lay apart from her own. As for higher
                  aspiring, if Geoffrey had only longed for himself as ardently as Charlotte did for
                  him, he would have been a Christian long ago.</p>
               <pb n="190-191" xml:id="VAC8381-00000096"/>
               <p>Geoffrey's evil course had made Charlotte very ardent in the temperance cause, and
                  before she left home she resolved to visit Katy Moreland, and see if she could not
                  persuade her to stop selling beer and liquor.</p>
               <p>At this proposition Katy laughed openly.</p>
               <p>"Tony talks just so, and I tell him he can do as he likes about the business when
                  I'm dead. Poor Tony! he gets right vexed at me. On hot days I may take a mug of
                  ale to cool me off, and of a cold night some hot beer, with a bit of butter melted
                  atop, to warm me up. No more, I assure you, miss; not a drop stronger; but Tony
                  won't even touch that. Now, if I kept a disorderly shop or let men get drunk here,
                  it would be my duty to listen to you in a minute. But it is just the drink now and
                  the drink then, going and coming from work, or a pitcher of ale to carry home for
                  supper. Uncle Terry stops longest, being old and slow and sociable like. But all
                  is quiet and tidy, I do assure you."</p>
               <p>"No use to arguefy with 'er, miss," spoke Tony from between a beer-barrel and a
                  raccoon. "The honly harguement I knows is to knock those bungs hinto the 'oles
                  some night, and let the business run hitself hout."</p>
               <p>"That would be downright robbery, Tony," said Aunt Katy, assuming the pathetic;
                  "and I know you wouldn't go and treat her as fed and clothed you like a mother
                  that way, indeed, Tony."</p>
               <p>Pathos on Aunt Katy's part brought tears on Tony's; he dug his fists into his
                  eyes, and remarked:</p>
               <p>"It was a dumb shame if he wouldn't," and in muttered words registered some vows
                  that fell only into the heedless ear of the stuffed raccoon.</p>
               <p>"Even by the little liquor you sell, you may injure some one, Mrs. Moreland," said
                  Charlotte. "There is Uncle Terry, for instance. You tell me his daughter is dead,
                  fairly worried into her grave by poverty and hard work, and poor little Judy is
                  coming up as she can. Terry might have been a very different man if he could have
                  got no liquor to drink; and consider, yours is the only shop in this
                  settlement."</p>
               <pb n="192-193" xml:id="VAC8381-00000097"/>
               <p>"Yes; but, dear heart, if <emph>I</emph> hadn't had this tidy little shop to use
                  the little trade up, some dirty rapscallion would have been sure to set up a worse
                  one."</p>
               <p>"Even in that view of the case, you should have let this business alone. God will
                  hold you responsible for the mischief you do, not for what your neighbor might
                  have done."</p>
               <p>"Indeed, miss," said Katy, aggrieved, "I give Judy nearly all she eats, and I put
                  her up to go to school."</p>
               <p>"Yes; hand she learns like ha clipper; hand, my eye, hain't she ha cute one, black
                  eyes and little tight curls!"</p>
               <p>Tony evidently greatly admired Miss Judy.</p>
               <p>There was nothing to be made out of Katy, who thought she did as well as could be
                  expected, and that many of her neighbors might do worse. "When Tony got a man and
                  got his own head," said Katy, "they should see what they should see." Then she
                  fell to talking scientifically, and indulged in memories of the defunct
                  Moreland.</p>
               <p>"There's a widow moth—poor thing, flies only at night—but Moreland was abroad at
                  all times hunting. And yon spider is reckoned the biggest ever was found—bigger
                  nor a tarantula, I've heard tell."</p>
               <p>"'Bout as poisonous as whiskey, too," said Tony.</p>
               <p>Overhead a doeskin was stretched out and nailed to the rafters; the head, stuffed
                  with hay, hung dangling almost against Charlotte's bonnet.</p>
               <p>"Moreland put it there to dry; I helped him do it. Dear heart, I didn't think he'd
                  never take it down!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Moreland sought out new objects of interest.</p>
               <p>"Do you see that case above Tony's head? That's a green heron—'Fly-up-the-Creeks'
                  they do call 'em here, miss. They hardly ever call anything by the right name;
                  they don't know. Fly up, indeed! just as if they <emph>stayed</emph> up the creek
                  and never come down!"</p>
               <p>Beyond the green heron was a ground-hog, hopelessly stranded in a box of mixed
                  nails, with its nose pushed into a rusty coffee-mill<pb n="194-195"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000098"/> mill, while the most forlorn of pole-cats, with hay
                  bulging out where its eyes should have been, showed its teeth between a battered
                  tea-caddy and a broken-necked decanter.</p>
               <p>Queer Katy! she wouldn't move even to dust or repair her Moreland's penates. She
                  might have had a decent, thrifty, original little shop there, but Katy was joined
                  to her idols, and saw money only in glasses of ale and beer.</p>
               <p>We now turn from following Charlotte's quiet way, to chronicle still the haps and
                  mishaps of our Best Fellow, whom, in spite of all his devious wanderings, Heaven
                  seemed still to favor.</p>
               <p>In the buoyancy of his disposition, with health returning, with new hopes
                  springing in his breast, Geoffrey found himself a happy and beloved inmate of Dr.
                  Gray's pleasant home. The doctor was a friend of student days, yielding Geoffrey
                  that tribute of regard that none seemed able to deny. His wife had been ready to
                  welcome the wanderer and promote his restoration—ready from womanly humanity and
                  sympathy with that brave-hearted sister whose life was so entwined with
                  Geoffrey's. Now that Geoffrey had come into her family, he won these sympathies
                  and interests for himself, and the sisterly kindness of his hostess prevented him
                  from ever feeling himself an intruder in their domestic circle. That part of
                  Geoffrey's history which related to Fred Gay was known only to his own family and
                  Mr. Alden; no hint of it had been given at the doctor's. Geoffrey soon found
                  himself cordially received by the inhabitants of one of the pleasantest towns
                  lying on the Hudson. Society here was free from many of the extravagances and
                  temptations of life in the city. First for Doctor Gray's sake, and then for his
                  own, our pleasant Geoffrey was made welcome, and speedily felt himself a man
                  again.</p>
               <p>Surrounded now at the doctor's by the books and appliances of the medical
                  profession, Geoffrey began from curiosity to turn his attention to it, and soon
                  found in himself the same interest for pharmacy which he had formerly experienced
                  for law. His facile mind so attached itself to the<pb n="196-197"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000099"/> problems and discoveries of medicine and surgery,
                  so rapidly received new information, and so acutely reasoned upon it, that he
                  began to wonder if this were not <emph>the</emph> pursuit for which nature had
                  especially designed him. Geoffrey was ambitious in a measure, and he saw that
                  eminence was as possible of attainment to a physician as to a lawyer. He was
                  benevolent, and thought that it would be a beautiful thing to spend life in
                  healing the sick, soothing pain, preventing the spread of disease, and restoring
                  hope to sorrowful and despairing hearts.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey was avaricious of affection and esteem. He saw Doctor Gray's patients
                  watching for his coming, greeting his entrance with an eager smile, hanging on his
                  words as on the deliverances of an oracle, fear changing into confidence and woe
                  to thankful joy when the doctor smiled good cheer. Geoffrey would relish being so
                  desired, so trusted, so beloved. How sweet to win profound gratitude in the
                  exercise of one's daily business!</p>
               <p>"When I won a case," said Geoffrey to his friend, "I made my client glad, but at
                  the expense of the defeat and chagrin of the other party. In the pursuit of
                  business, I sometimes won success for those by whom success was not truly
                  deserved. At other times, the rights of both parties were nearly equally balanced
                  in my mind; but I could only bend my energies to obtaining the triumph of one.
                  Again, when guilt was clear, and the criminal in every way worthy of his
                  punishment, there were often innocent families, parents, sisters, children, or a
                  wife to lament his fate, and temper by their tears and their despair the
                  satisfaction of rendering justice to an ill-deserver. Your profession has none of
                  these drawbacks. You heal a sick man, and everybody rejoices. If he dies in spite
                  of you, you know you relieved a great measure of his sufferings, and used the best
                  efforts to save him. You regret his loss, and have keen sympathy to give his
                  friends, and they love you for what you would have done."</p>
               <p>"You paint it in rose-color," said Doctor Gray. "Sometimes friends turn against
                     you,<pb n="198-199" xml:id="VAC8381-00000100"/> and say: 'Doctor, somebody else
                  would have done infinitely better.' Perhaps your patient gets restive, just as
                  your cure is well in progress, and dispenses with your services, adding to the
                  dismissal unkind remarks; again, all is going well, when some bungling nurse
                  forgets or mistakes your orders, and brings danger or confusion. Often behind your
                  back an interfering 'old granny' is guilty of some malpractice which would be
                  absurd if it were not dangerous. You are called up of nights, and sent for in
                  haste of days, to go miles for some mistake, or whim, or nervous excitement. If
                  you tell the truth, you are not believed; if you tell a lie, you are universally
                  condemned; if you hold your peace, nobody is satisfied. If you are calm and firm,
                  you are styled cruel and heartless. If you are sympathetic or voluble, you are
                  supposed to be frightened, and every one about you gets frightened likewise. My
                  dear Geoffrey, don't fall in love with my profession without counting the
                  cost."</p>
               <p>"But you like your profession, respect it, enjoy its practice."</p>
               <p>"Yes, on the whole I do," said Doctor Gray.</p>
               <p>"And as I never mean to return to law, having many important private reasons for
                  forsaking it," said Geoffrey with a blush, "and as your profession attracts me
                  exceedingly, what studies, what preparation would be needful fairly to establish
                  me in its practice?"</p>
               <p>"For you, less than for many," replied Doctor Gray. "Your reading is extensive;
                  you are conversant with many studies which belong to our profession; and, as you
                  are aware, you have a genius, a quickness of apprehension and of application, that
                  are seldom equalled. I never saw any one like you, and I don't suppose any one
                  else ever did, except those who had the happiness of knowing Admirable
                  Crichton."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey laughed.</p>
               <p>"I hope you will not call me fickle if I now devote myself to medicine as your
                  student."</p>
               <p>"There is one qualification which I deem important, which you lack, my friend,"
                  said Doctor Gray seriously.</p>
               <pb n="200-201" xml:id="VAC8381-00000101"/>
               <p>"And what may that be?" demanded Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"Every physician <emph>ought</emph> to be a Christian. The man who stands nearly
                  every day face to face with death; who is frequently the only person summoned to
                  the side of the dying; whose solemn duty it not seldom becomes to tell a patient
                  that he has but a few hours to live, should be able with this astounding news to
                  give some consolation, and to indicate the best use to be made of those precious
                  last hours. The physician, as you say, frequently becomes the oracle of his
                  patients, and then his usefulness can be immense, if he is able to point to
                  interests high above his immediate profession."</p>
               <p>"That all may be true," said Geoffrey; "yet, taking your profession through, we
                  shall find a large proportion of practitioners who make no pretension of
                  religion."</p>
               <p>"I am aware of that," answered Doctor Gray; "but I do not believe with Pope that <q>
                     <l>'Whatever is, is right.'</l>
                  </q> That there may be found among physicians many irreligious, careless, or
                  absolutely infidel men, does not prove that there should be such. There are also
                  many ignoramuses and quacks. But, filling the profession with the men most
                  suitable to its demands, we should find neither the scoffer nor the
                  charlatan."</p>
               <p>"I am no disbeliever," said Geoffrey. "I admire religion in its theory, and
                  religious people in their practice. I take my fellowmen at what they profess to
                  be, and when they say they are Christians I believe that they are. Piety has made
                  Charlotte a vast deal better than I am; and, if you will permit me to be personal,
                  I think that your religion is an ornament to you, and that you ornament your
                  religion."</p>
               <p>"Why, then, appreciating piety thus, do you not accept it for yourself?"</p>
               <p>"It never comes home to me somehow," said Geoffrey; "or, perhaps, I have as much
                  as anybody, but have a different way of showing it. I do not oppose myself to it,
                  and, if I lack it, some day it may come to me. There was a day when godliness
                  seemed nearer than now."</p>
               <pb n="202-203" xml:id="VAC8381-00000102"/>
               <p>"A false notion—very false. Your complaisant indifference is often the most
                  dangerous form of opposition. Of open and violent attacks on Christianity you
                  might repent. Now, you cannot see yourself at all blameworthy. Piety won't come to
                  you like the day-dawn, Geoffrey, breaking unprayed for. If it is worth having, it
                  is worth asking, and the Sun of Righteousness generally shines only upon those who
                  cry, 'Lord! open thou my eyes!'"</p>
               <p>"To go back, with your permission, to our first subject," said Geoffrey, who found
                  his friend's observations too personal, "I believe I shall study medicine. I am
                  not too old to change my profession, and I think this just suits me. Perhaps I
                  shall settle near you, Gray, and be so popular as to run you out of practice—a
                  poor return that for all your goodness!"</p>
               <p>"I shall gladly welcome you as a brother-physician; and all the recompense what
                  you call my kindness demands, is to see you becoming worthy of yourself and of
                  your great abilities."</p>
               <p>To Charlotte, Geoffrey wrote:</p>
               <p>"What would you say to my writing M.D. after my name, Charley? I wish I had
                  studied medicine in the first place. I believe it is just what I was intended for.
                  I take to it naturally. If I had chosen that rather than law when I left college,
                  we could have studied together, and you could have helped me in that. You do not
                  change as easily as I do, so I suppose I must go on alone. As soon as I am ready
                  to practise, Charley, you must come and keep house for me, and I will do better
                  than I did before. A doctor cannot mingle so much in society as a lawyer, for his
                  business demands him at all hours, and, having so much depending on him, it is an
                  imperative duty to be cautious and always master of himself. You need worry about
                  me no more, Charley my love; for, though I haven't signed teetotal, I have given
                  up all that can intoxicate, and—great is the force of good example!—prefer a cup
                  of coffee to a glass of wine. In parties here, they have lemonade and coffee
                  instead of liquors, and a 'wine-room' is quite unheard<pb n="204-205"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000103"/> heard of. How our New York friends would stare at
                  such parties! But, after all, they are much more sensible, and indeed more
                  hospitable, for they do not leave the guests used up in brain and body, ashamed of
                  themselves and of every one else."</p>
               <p>Charlotte was inclined to be dismal over Geoffrey's letter; she felt as if he were
                  doing well only, because he had no temptation to do ill. She felt this so much
                  that she wrote to Hector Gray about it:</p>
               <p>"I fear your cure is not radical. Geoffrey may be sober, because other people
                  about him are so, and he has no opportunity to be otherwise. He was always so
                  susceptible to the influence of those about him. I fear that the fatal taste is
                  not dead, but asleep; that the habit, so ruinous to him, is not cut up and rooted
                  out to the very last fibre, but only clipped down below the surface, ready to
                  spring up again."</p>
               <p>Doctor Gray acknowledged in his heart the justice of her fears when he
                  replied:</p>
               <p>"What you say may be true. Earthly cures are superficial things at best. I cannot
                  not supply my man with motives, nor can I make over his heart and sow it full of
                  celestial grace. A poor little surface work is all I can pretend to, but I am
                  doing that as well as I can. It is so often in hereditary, constitutional, or
                  chronic diseases. We may seem to cure them; our patient is said to be well. For
                  the time being he <emph>is</emph> well. But given the same occasions, let the same
                  injuries, or exposures, or excesses recur that developed the disease in the first
                  place, and the trouble is back again, and very likely 'the last error shall be
                  worse than the first.' As far as Geoffrey is concerned, I am doing what I can for
                  him, making open way for something better, and you and I, all of us, must pray
                  that the better will come in and take possession."</p>
               <p>Pray! Charlotte felt as if her life were one long struggling prayer for Geoffrey.
                  Striving, agonizing in prayer for him, Geoffrey left to other people. The easy
                  disposition of this genial Best Fellow was such that he could not bear to trouble
                  himself. It was ill work to go grubbing down into motives<pb n="206-207"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000104"/> tives, desiring spiritual renovations and
                  revolutions. He shrank from having this Royal Best Fellow in the World proclaimed
                  to himself the chief of sinners, having no goodness at all except in the name of
                  another. And just as he left the burden of his soul's well-being to press heavily
                  on other hearts, Geoffrey left self-denials and hard-toiling to other people, too.
                  What he earned, he spent. He must dress well not to disgrace his friends. He
                  bought books, and made presents, and put his name on charity subscriptions, and
                  went easily along. He did not worry himself about certain debts in New York: they
                  were out of sight, and, therefore, out of mind. He must take a new start in a new
                  profession, and then, no doubt, money would flow to him in a perpetual stream. And
                  then, if there were any little affairs that needed settling, he could easily
                  attend to them. Meanwhile, who could criticise or condemn him? Not the Grays, who
                  were unaware of previous entanglements. Not the new friends and associates, who
                  had never seen so generous and thoroughly oughly glorious a fellow as the royal
                  Geoffrey. Not the dear, fond parents who weekly got long, spicy, loving letters,
                  full of penitence for sorrows caused in days gone by, of promises for days to
                  come, and cheering assertions for the present. Not Charlotte, whose life toward
                  him was always patience, forgiveness, and half-idolatry. Charlotte read those long
                  letters—for Geoffrey was the most faithful and delightful of correspondents—read
                  them, and was so glad that he was safe and happy, that she was quite content to
                  work, and save, and devote her earnings and her savings to making a free man of
                  her brother, and sending him forth in his new profession unburdened by debt, free
                  from reminders of past sins and sorrows.</p>
               <p>Helped nobly by her uncle, who gave in the guise of Christmas and birthday
                  presents, Charlotte was able to accomplish her purpose. Fred Gay had his own
                  again, and Geoffrey was sent the receipted bills of his city creditors. We do not
                  refer to debts contracted in gaming or billiards; that was mire in which Charlotte
                  could not meddle,<pb n="208-209" xml:id="VAC8381-00000105"/> and whatever Geoffrey
                  had failed to pay in those shameful days when he held Fred Gay's money, he now
                  gracefully ignored.</p>
               <p>Charlotte was greatly afraid that, having been disappointed in Geoffrey, Uncle
                  Ames should lose the affection which he had cherished for him. Never a good act of
                  Geoffrey's which Charlotte did not find an opportanity to tell. Never a loving or
                  a witty passage in those long letters which she was not careful to read in the
                  family circle. What of the past circumstances had forced her to unfold now lapsed
                  into silence, and Geoffrey was set forth by Charlotte only in his legitimate
                  position of the Best Fellow in the World.</p>
               <p>No word of coldness or condemnation did Uncle Ames give to Geoffrey. He spoke of
                  his nephew with interest and kindness, but daily before his eyes grew the beauty
                  and strength of Charlotte's character, and his heart received her as his daughter,
                  while he often futilely wished that Heaven had given her to be his son rather than
                  his niece. By her lofty nobility of character, Charlotte won hearts worth winning;
                  for the grace of his lips, all the world was Geoffrey's friend.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
               <p>A NEW era opens in Geoffrey Hunter's history. Hitherto the Best Fellow has loved
                  himself first, Charlotte next, and other people in their order. Now awakes the
                  strongest impulse, the noblest feeling of his life—an emotion congenial to his
                  joyous and bountiful nature. Our Geoffrey is in love!</p>
               <p>Our Best Fellow, like very many of such fellows, has been greatly selfish.
                  Incapable of wishing to marry under any less influence than a profound passion
                  which should fill his ideal of love, he had never found a being so perfect as to
                  be worthy of his cherished model—Geoffrey Hunter. Geoffrey would have been shocked
                  and indignant at this statement, but it is undeniably true. Charlotte was his
                  sister; he loved her dearly; thought he had the first claim upon her, and accepted
                  unhesitatingly the sacrifice of her life. Mrs. Gray was his kind, plain-speaking
                  friend; he said she did him a great deal of good by her advice and her
                  pleasantly-uttered reproofs. Many young ladies had been agreeable to talk or dance
                  with. For the rest, there were mothers, of whom his mother was the exponent—dear,
                  good, true-hearted creatures, addicted to making warm stockings and delightful
                  doughnuts; given to repairing one's wardrobe, and beaming satisfaction and
                  curiosity through various pairs of spectacles.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey had frequently made the foolish assertion that he admired all women so
                  deeply that he could never make choice of any particular one as the object of
                  especial adoration. Fate—shall we say?—now made choice for him, or was it the
                  development of the secret predilection of long ago? We are not sufficiently
                  devoted to psychology to discuss the question whether Geoffrey's love was a
                  resurrection or a new creation. Enough, there was a love, and love ennobles.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey now went out frequently with Dr. Gray to visit his patients, and
                  accompanied him, one morning, on a ten-miles' ride, to see a Mrs. Foster. The
                  doctor left Geoffrey<pb n="212-213" xml:id="VAC8381-00000107"/> frey in the buggy,
                  and our young man was dividing his attention between Hufeland's "Art of Prolonging
                  Life" and the handsomely laid-out garden that rolled back from either side of the
                  carriage-way, when a young girl came to the buggy, saying: "Doctor Gray wants the
                  brown case."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey handed over the case, wishing that it might have taken some time to find
                  it; and then, instead of devoting himself further to Hufeland or the garden, began
                  to stare at the windows, wondering if he might at least catch the shadow of this
                  fair damsel passing by, and half-vexed at poor, unconscious Doctor Gray for not
                  sending her on another errand. His patience was rewarded by seeing the pretty girl
                  accompany the doctor to the door, and watch him as he drove away.</p>
               <p>"What a charming young lady!" cried Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Foster's niece—one of the nicest girls near here," said Doctor Gray,
                  consulting his watch and whipping up his horse.</p>
               <p>"I suppose you couldn't tell me her name, seeing I'm dying to know," said
                  Geoffrey, laughing.</p>
               <p>"Gone at last!" cried the doctor, lifting his eyebrows. "Surrendered at the first
                  approach of the enemy—Geoffrey the invincible!"</p>
               <p>"Pooh!" said Geoffrey. "Most likely she is engaged to be married, and you know
                  it."</p>
               <p>"No; she is notoriously hard to win," said Doctor Gray, and then he glanced again
                  at the irresistible Geoffrey, and a troubled look came into his face.</p>
               <p>"But her name?" persisted the Best Fellow.</p>
               <p>"Oh! her name. She is Miss Zell Ranleigh."</p>
               <p>"Zell! Little Zell Ranleigh!" cried our friend, while a swift panorama of a fairy
                  child who hung fascinated about his chair, who hemmed him a pocket-handkerchief,
                  who wept because she was not invited to the party, and who slily lent him five
                  dollars, swept before his mental vision.</p>
               <p>"Zell! I knew her years ago in boarding-school<pb n="214-215"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000108"/> ing-school. She was Charlotte's pet room-mate—a
                  witching child, and now become <q>
                     <l>'Idalian Aphrodite, beautiful!'"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>"Very far gone—dropped into poetry already," said Doctor Gray. Then came the
                  troubled look.</p>
               <p>"I'm going to see her and reclaim the old acquaintance," said Geoffrey, adding
                  complacently, "Zell always liked me."</p>
               <p>No answer from Doctor Gray, and Geoffrey rattled on: "To start all fair in my new
                  profession, I must have a wife. Alden will be running off with my Charley some
                  day. I don't believe she'd leave law and love to be my housekeeper." On this point
                  Geoffrey had not hitherto had a doubt. "Oh! my mind's made up: Benedict must get
                  married. How glum you are, Gray! Only you are married, I'd fancy you wanted the
                  beautiful Zell yourself."</p>
               <p>Doctor Gray did not know what answer to make. He loved Geoffrey—wished him well.
                  He saw him about to carry on a courtship in his own eager, dashing fashion,
                  striking ing out of his way every obstacle; winning the wife without a doubt; but,
                  when won, would he make her happy? What surety was there that Geoffrey would not
                  again madly go astray, and now wreck another life besides his own?</p>
               <p>Doctor Gray's piety was practical. He believed and had spoken that a physician
                  should be a Christian; he also believed that godliness should be the foundation of
                  the family. God united in Eden a pair whose faces were set toward immortal
                  holiness and happiness, alike his children, into whose joint home his presence
                  came—who, fallen and driven from the paradisaic gate, cherished still the worship
                  of the Eternal, and waited for the coming Christ.</p>
               <p>Quick to appreciate the emotions of those near him, Geoffrey already felt the
                  chilling influence of his friend's secret doubt; and his mental thermometer began
                  to drop down from its summer heat, and fall into the nipping regions of untimely
                  frosts.</p>
               <p>"Miss Ranleigh," said Doctor Gray, seeing that he must say something, "is a
                  Christian."</p>
               <pb n="216-217" xml:id="VAC8381-00000109"/>
               <p>"Very good," says Geoffrey; "an additional grace. I have always intended to marry
                  a Christian."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," said the doctor slowly, "Miss Ranleigh may have formed the same
                  resolution."</p>
               <p>Long silence. They had passed several milestones before Geoffrey spoke again.</p>
               <p>"Pray, do they—Christians, you know—often make that resolution?"</p>
               <p>"They always ought," said the doctor honestly.</p>
               <p>"You are hard upon me, Gray," said Geoffrey sadly.</p>
               <p>"Not half so hard as you are upon yourself. What hinders you, Geoffrey, from
                  standing among the sons of God? For ever and for ever the Spirit striving and
                  pleading through human lips—why, Geoffrey, why so deaf?"</p>
               <p>"Now, look here, Gray," said Geoffrey, leaning back in the buggy and initiating an
                  argument: "religion, we both admit, is a good thing; we should say that it would
                  be a blessing and a safeguard in every family. Now, if we cannot have a great deal
                  of it, we need not refuse a little. Better, <emph>I</emph> should say, that one
                  party should be a Christian than that two sinners should be united. If the
                  children cannot have a Christian father, it is surely an advantage to have a pious
                  mother at whose knees to say their prayers. If we cannot be as good as your lofty
                  idea, my friend, let us be as good as we can."</p>
               <p>"Learn, Geoffrey, as from a parable, from the early story of our earth; when the
                  children of God united with the children of men, came a race of giants that were
                  not of the race of heaven. Until then a consecrated line preserved the world from
                  the fierceness of the divine displeasure. When the sanctity of the household was
                  desecrated by the union of God's friends and foes, irreligion spread abroad—type
                  and precursor of the flood—and the world was doomed."</p>
               <p>"Beyond me; far beyond me. O Saint Christopher, my friend—you who can take a whole
                  tree for your staff—how soon do you wade beyond my depth in these waters of<pb
                     n="218-219" xml:id="VAC8381-00000110"/> controversy! The immortal Geoffrey has
                  not yet reached all knowledge."</p>
               <p>Riding on through the ever-new beauty of the spring, most likely Geoffrey was
                  weaving visions of his love, and filling his future with new light unknown before.
                  As for Doctor Gray, though no croaker and augurer of evil, he mused of new dangers
                  likely to beset his friend's way. Zell Ranleigh had been hard to win; but what if
                  Geoffrey, known in childhood, had been the cherished hero of her life? Geoffrey
                  was determined to press his suit, and Doctor Gray knew what his friend did not:
                  that Zell was now wealthy. With this girl for his wife, Geoffrey would come into
                  possession of abundant means; he would be no longer urged to labor and study by
                  the spur of necessity; the temptations of fortune would surround him; ease and
                  idleness would be apt to foster the old habit, probably now not dead, but asleep.
                  What then? Why, this glorious Geoffrey would be lost to himself; his shining
                  talents would be lost to the world; and the keen-eyed doctor knew that Zell, who
                  was among fair women what the delicate exotic from the tropics is among the
                  flowers, would droop and die at the cold touch of sorrow.</p>
               <p>At the first renewal of the old-time acquaintance with Zell, Geoffrey was spurred
                  on in work and study by an unwonted desire to become worthy of love and
                  confidence. Nothing was too much to offer Zell. Geoffrey would have rejoiced in
                  gathering all earth's honors and emoluments to lay them at her feet. Doctor Gray
                  loved Geoffrey too well not to rejoice in his new happiness; but he most
                  emphatically rejoiced with trembling. Was this love to be Geoffrey's salvation, or
                  Zell's destruction?</p>
               <p>When Geoffrey announced his engagement, his parents were greatly delighted. They
                  felt at once relieved of all the anxieties for him that had hitherto oppressed
                  them. His father said, "All the boy needed to steady him was a good wife;" and the
                  mother complacently remarked that "Geoffrey, being the Best Fellow in the World,
                  was certain to make the best husband," and in her loving<pb n="220-221"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000111"/> maternal heart she felt that, though Zell was rich,
                  and beautiful, and good, she was not too good for Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>We wonder if Charlotte was jealous when she found herself dethroned from her
                  empire over her twin-brother's heart, and learned that the little Zell of long ago
                  had supplanted her in the Best Fellow's affections?</p>
               <p>Yes, probably she <emph>was</emph> jealous, for she was not sincerely glad at the
                  news, and hoped that the marriage would be put off for a while.</p>
               <p>But now, on the whole, we think she had no sinister feelings, for she found
                  herself often building bright air-castles for her brother's married home, and send
                  more thoughts than formerly to one Oliver Alden.</p>
               <p>It was on a bright May-day when Geoffrey first saw the grown-up Zell at her aunt's
                  door. A year went by; May came again, and with it a letter from Hector Gray to
                  Charlotte. Thus wrote Hector:</p>
               <p>"Of course, you know, Geoffrey is going to be married. As I chanced to be the one
                  to throw him in Miss Ranleigh's way, I could not get it out of my mind that I owed
                  her an explanation that might be a warning. I know you do not think that wrong;
                  and you are sure that I said the best I could for Geoffrey. You can guess the
                  result; my communication did not shake her love or her determination to keep her
                  promise. I did not know the promise was made until then, but I think my story has
                  made her cautious. Well, they are to be married, and she will have no grand
                  wedding, for that and the succeeding receptions would be so full of temptations,
                  and she means they shall shun very gay society. So what are this sapient couple
                  going to do? Why, have a quiet, unexpected marriage at our sombre old village
                  church! Then they are going to surprise my wife and me with a visit; then go to
                  spend three days with a favorite cousin of Zell's, lately set up in house-keeping.
                  Next, rush off to Uncle Ames's, and astonish <emph>you</emph> nearly out of your
                  senses, and finally carry you in triumph to the dear old home to amaze the good
                  people there abiding! You perceive some bird of the air has revealed to<pb
                     n="222-223" xml:id="VAC8381-00000112"/> me their secrets. It seemed to me that
                  no surprise, however joyful, would compensate you for the loss of seeing your
                  beloved Geoffrey married—at least, to be honest, my wife suggested that view.
                  Hence this breach of trust and revelation of private plans. Now, if you like, you
                  can come on, witness the ceremony, unknown to them; hasten back to Uncle Ames's,
                  and be as surprised as is needful when this joyful pair make their
                  appearance."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Gray was right. Charlotte Hunter would have been bitterly disappointed if she
                  had not known of the arrangements for Geoffrey's wedding. All she wanted was to be
                  present; they need not know, and, if it made part of their happiness to surprise
                  people, they might indulge the harmless penchant.</p>
               <p>She had always loved the winsome little "chum" of school-days. Now that she
                  refused all style and splendor at her marriage, and chose this simple fashion, all
                  for Geoffrey's safety, Charlotte took her to her heart of hearts.</p>
               <p>The sunny first of June brought the bridal morning; it brought Charlotte also, who
                  had reached the village by the night-train, breakfasted, and renovated her
                  tasteful travelling-dress at the hotel, and now early took her way to an obscure
                  corner of the church, to watch, unseen, the coming of Zell and Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>The church was built of granite in Gothic style. Over the outside ivy crept and
                  clung; the sunlight came through long, narrow windows of stained glass, and so
                  made broken rainbows over the time-worn floor and incommodious pews. Securely
                  sheltered by a dusty column furthest from the open door, Charlotte sat patiently
                  waiting, noting how the warm, fragrant air stole in the chill and shadowy place,
                  and the bird-songs were borne in on the breeze, while one audacious warbler
                  flitted in and went singing up into the dusty corners of the high-pointed roof.
                  The pulpit, books, and cushions had lost their early gold and crimson splendors,
                  and were tarnished and dim. Here, on a seat, lay a forgotten glove, a posy a child
                     had<pb n="224-225" xml:id="VAC8381-00000113"/> dropped, a tract unappreciated
                  by its receiver, who possibly used his piety only in church and thought it a work
                  of supererogation to carry anything good away. Charlotte mused of all the changes
                  that had here shaken human hearts. What burden of woes had been brought to these
                  now deserted seats! What words of consolation had here echoed that still, small
                  voice on Horeb! What tremendous warnings must needs have been spoken! What fears
                  aroused! Passing from the spiritual to the visible, what bridals had here been
                  blessed, what baptisms, what burials, what gracious sacramental seasons! Hence had
                  gone out rejoicing brides and grooms; souls with the benison of peace after
                  alarms; still forms asleep, on which should dawn no brief to-morrow, borne away
                  with weeping, hidden under the coffin and the pall.</p>
               <p>But now these reveries were broken: the sexton came in and looked about. Two young
                  ladies, out for a walk, guessed a wedding, and went into one of the front seats.
                  Some children left their play to watch the holy rite. Carriage-wheels grated near
                  the door: now entered the minister and passed down the aisle, and now those waited
                  for so eagerly by that unseen witness, Zell and Geoffrey, in all the beauty of
                  their youth and hope—two of God's fairest creations seeming most fitly joined
                  together. O Geoffrey! forgetting all else in this present gladness, how does that
                  sister-heart, for ever faithful, join in the prayer for blessings on this act and
                  hour! How does the great soul that could clasp a world if need were in its loving
                  compassions, go out to that fair Zell who so trustfully puts her soul into
                  another's keeping!</p>
               <p>Few are the weighty words that bind these two for ever; full soon is welded the
                  indissoluble bond. They have turned away from the altar of God, and Charlotte,
                  from behind the pillar, marks them coming down through the church—Zell, child and
                  woman, a dainty creature, fashioned for sunshine and right tender keeping;
                  Geoffrey in the prime of his beauty, fit model for a portrait of St. John, son of
                  thunder, and, still best, loving<pb n="226-227" xml:id="VAC8381-00000114"/> and
                  beloved. How Charlotte's heart went out to them, and still she would not
                  speak!</p>
               <p>The carriage rolled away; she heard it, but she did not see. The girls, and
                  pastor, and children were gone; the sexton went here and there. A great,
                  unutterable, heartbreaking loneliness came upon Charlotte. In all the world,
                  twin-spirits went hand in hand—she only stood alone. She had lived for Geoffrey,
                  and now Zell had claimed him. She stepped into the aisle, and stood looking toward
                  the spot where those two had vanished.</p>
               <p>Some one came up behind her and took her hand.</p>
               <p>"What, Charlotte! mourning for the traitor! After <emph>this</emph> defection, he
                  is not worth a tear!"</p>
               <p>It was Oliver Alden, and he drew her hand within his arm.</p>
               <p>"I knew," he said, laughing, "that I should find you here, and that this extremity
                  would be my opportunity."</p>
               <p>So they went out of the church, but Charlotte had gone suddenly into a tower of
                  strength, and was no longer out in the world lonely. So the birds were merry, and
                  the flowers were sweet, and over all the blessed sunshine poured as doth befit a
                  fair June morning!</p>
               <p>It was almost time for the train which Charlotte must take back to her uncle's,
                  and Oliver Alden went with her, though, we will admit, not without some hints that
                  they might first return to the church, send for the minister, and bravely follow
                  the example of Zell and Geoffrey. Those suggestions Charlotte promptly checked,
                  though she certainly drew comparisons to Geoffrey's disadvantage between the
                  brother who forsook her for Zell, and the faithful Oliver, who would not forget
                  her for any woman in the world. Oliver left her at New York, with the
                  understanding that he was to accompany Geoffrey and his bride when, in the course
                  of a few days, they went on to Judge Ames's, and then go with them and Charlotte
                  to the Hunter homestead by the Happy River—a river that would surely now sing
                  gayer songs than ever before! Charlotte, musing<pb n="228-229"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000115"/> on surprises, and thinking that, while some were
                  very joyous, others contained elements of regret, was false enough to Geoffrey to
                  send a telegram to her mother, stating that she would soon come home with
                  important guests. She did this knowing that good mother Hunter would be
                  heart-broken if denied the privilege of setting her dwelling in especial order
                  from garret to cellar, and filling pantry and cupboard with "good store of all
                  that's nice."</p>
               <p>"There now, mother," cried Eva, when this despatch came from her sister, "either
                  Geoffrey has been getting married, or Charlotte has."</p>
               <p>Mother Hunter gazed calmly into vacancy through her various spectacles, and then
                  replied: "It is not Charlotte, Eva. She would not get married without letting her
                  mother know all about it, and giving her a chance to speak her mind. It's
                  Geoffrey. Yes; though he was always the Best Fellow, the best son, and the best
                  brother, as you know very well, Eva, he would have his own way of doing things,
                  and always thought that what suited him would suit other people. He had such a
                  merry disposition, God bless him! I hope his wife won't fret him, or cross him,
                  dear boy! He is so jolly and good-hearted, it would be a pity to vex him. We must
                  get at making <figure/> fruit-cake right away. I'm glad the hens and cows are at
                  their best, and that we have so many fine young chickens. Do just run over in your
                  mind, daughter, what our Geoffrey liked most, and we'll have it all.</p>
               <pb n="230-231" xml:id="VAC8381-00000116"/>
               <p>"O dear!" said Eva. "Why, there are tarts and macaroons, mountain-cake, and
                  almond-cake, pound-cake, chicken-salad, and plum-pudding, and fritters. Why,
                  mother, he liked the whole cook-book right through. You know that as well as I
                  do."</p>
               <p>"Yes, dear fellow, it was very easy to suit him. He liked a little of
                  everything."</p>
               <p>"And now he's married," said Eva. "I <emph>hope</emph> he is. Why, Lottie will
                  marry Mr. Alden, I'm sure. I've been right vexed at Lottie being such a dunce on
                  Geof's account. I can't see as it was her business to stay single and work for
                  him."</p>
               <p>"Oh! well, to be sure, he is such a good fellow, anything was a pleasure to do for
                  him, Eva. Have we had all the curtains done up? And I'm glad we got a new carpet
                  for the parlor; not that I care for myself, but Geoffrey always liked to have
                  things handsome. Do you suppose his wife is beautiful? She surely ought to be; and
                  rich, they say. Well, Geoffrey could always find as many uses for money as anybody
                  I ever saw—he was so free-hearted. And good as an angel she is, I hear. I'm glad
                  of it, Eva. See, when she comes, that she has her own way in everything—she is our
                  Geoffrey's wife."</p>
               <p>"Dear knows!" cried Eva. After which lucid remark, she tossed her pretty head and
                  went out of the room.</p>
               <p>Those were right joyous days when Geoffrey and Zell, Charlotte and Oliver, were at
                  the homestead, loved and honored guests. Had Geoffrey been even less dear and his
                  transgressions more bitterly remembered, this young wife would have atoned for
                  all, for the family received her with enthusiasm.</p>
               <p>"She is just my ideal of a woman," said Eva to her sister half-reproachfully; "so
                  delicate and sweet-looking, as if she lived to delight people, and so merry in all
                  her ways. Not like you, Lottie, looking at life with such serious eyes, and
                  handling such weighty themes. Not that I mean to blame you, my dear, for I have
                  the highest esteem for your goodness—and only wish I had a tithe of it—but you are
                  just a little too strong-minded to suit me, after all, Lottie."</p>
               <pb n="232-233" xml:id="VAC8381-00000117"/>
               <p>Yet, in this dainty, child-like sister-in-law, there was a mine of strength which
                  should be discovered in its hour; and while Zell loved all her new relations,
                  rejoiced to enchant her kind-hearted father-in-law, to be petted by mother Hunter,
                  to frisk with Madam Eva's babies, the strongest sympathy drew her to Charlotte,
                  and those were the best hours when they two strolled off together in earnest
                  converse, wandering along the green bank of the Happy River, under spreading beech
                  or tasselled button-wood; or, seated by the swelling waters of Cold Spring, talked
                  softly, while bird-songs filled up the pauses of their speech: It was here that
                  they talked of Geoffrey. There was some knowledge of his past which could never be
                  unfolded to his wife, but other part she knew, perhaps, overwell.</p>
               <p>"The first thought of my life," said Zell to Charlotte, "must be to keep him from
                  going back to that <emph>unfortunate</emph> habit. I want to make our home so
                  happy that he will not need to seek pleasure outside of it; and to have there only
                  such friends as will not be a temptation. I wish he believed in pledges and in
                  total abstinence. I do. And, O sister Lottie!" and here the bitter secret, which
                  could no longer be hidden, spoke out, "we were at a dinner-party, the day before
                  we went on to you, and do you know, my, <emph>our</emph> Geoffrey took a glass of
                  wine? I looked so forlorn that he did not take a second, and he whispered to me
                  that wine never did him the least harm. Yet I think it is dangerous, and I never
                  shall have a drop of wine or any such drink in my house."</p>
               <p>The news of the home-coming had spread even to Katy Moreland. Since the white-day
                  when she had breakfasted under mother Hunter's auspices, Katy had now and then
                  ventured a call at the farm, inventing an errand of some kind for each occasion,
                  and had always been well received. Katy now got herself up elaborately, in a new
                  cap, with a carefully-quilled border, a wide black ribbon tied under her chin, a
                  blue gown spotted with white eyes until it made one feel eerie to look at it—this
                  gown looped<pb n="234-235" xml:id="VAC8381-00000118"/> above her best
                  petticoat—and, summer though it was, on went the blue cloth cloak, always full
                  dress to Katy.</p>
               <p>Said Katy to Tony: "It is beneath me to call on a bride that is, and a bride that
                  is to be, without a token. Sell a bird of Moreland's I will not, but Moreland
                  himself would have given a bird at such a time. So, Tony, it does not seem
                  sacrilegious to me to take the cedar-bird to Mrs. Geoffrey, as has married a
                  perfect gentleman, and the grebe to Miss Charlotte, ever the model of a lady."</p>
               <p>Having thus expressed herself, Katy set forth, holding a bird in either hand, and
                  thus made her appearance in the parlor at the farm, and presented her gifts with
                  this neat little speech, emphasized by two courtesies.</p>
               <p>To Zell: "Here's to you, ma'am, from me, and my Moreland dead and gone, and
                  wishing you all health and happiness. And here's to you, ma'am," turning with the
                  grebe to Charlotte, "wishing you the same, with respects from me, and Moreland,
                  who killed it, and stuffed it, and would ask it no better than your kindly
                  accepting, both." And here Katy bobbed a bow to each of the recipients of her
                  favor.</p>
               <p>Of course, Katy was made to sit down and have some of Mistress Hunter's many
                  varieties of cake, and samples of each were tied up for her to take home to Tony
                  and Judy.</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry mother has no wine for you," said Geoffrey, politely waiting on Katy as
                  if she were a duchess. "It is an oversight in your housekeeping, mammy dear. But,
                  Mrs. Moreland, I'll call on you, and have a glass of your ale for friendship's
                  sake, and that will make it all right."</p>
               <p>What did Katy say? To come in welcome? No; the quick-witted old woman caught a
                  swift look of dismay or disapproval, that, unseen by other eyes, passed between
                  Zell and Charlotte, and, though she did not apprehend the <emph>reason</emph> of
                  the look, she quietly answered Geoffrey: "It would be better not, sir. I've
                  nothing fit for a gentleman now, and it would worrit me to have you come. Cheap
                  stuff, fit only<pb n="236-237" xml:id="VAC8381-00000119"/> for hard workers, whose
                  tastes ain't overdainty, sir, that's all; but I take your kind intention just the
                  same."</p>
               <p>"Well," said Geoffrey, never at a loss to make conversation with prince or beggar,
                  "you must not forget to tell me how Uncle Terry is. Good-hearted and innocent as
                  ever?"</p>
               <p>"I've about lost my patience with him," said Katy. "He talks as smooth as ever;
                  overworks Judy, fearing, <emph>he</emph> says, that she'll grow up idle and set a
                  bad example. When I charge him with not providing decent food, or reg'lar meals,
                  he says young folks like Judy often get indigestion from overeating, and the
                  doctor don't allow Judy meat. The doctor, indeed! I was easy on Terry onct, I'll
                  admit, sir, but he's carried matters too far. He's very neglectful of that child,
                  and was of them that's dead and gone. But it do truly seem as if he gets gentler,
                  and smoother, and more plausibler spoken every blessed day."</p>
               <p>"A little too good and easy," laughed Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"Too ripe is next to rotten," said Katy tersely, and then, abashed at her plain
                  speech, added, "asking pardon, ladies and gentlemen all."</p>
               <p>"What a pity," said Zell when Katy was gone, "that that nice old woman should sell
                  such wicked poison!"</p>
               <p>"Oh! she must sell something," said the easy Geoffrey; "and I don't know as Katy
                  ever did any harm."</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," said Charlotte, though morally certain that Eva would condemn her as
                  too solemn, "God may hold her responsible for the premature death of Terry's wife
                  and daughter, for little Judy's blighted days, for Terry's worse than useless
                  existence, and for other evils which we do not know."</p>
               <p>"Horrors!" cried Eva, throwing up a pair of white hands in a tragic attitude well
                  calculated to display the rings she loved to wear. Then she darted to the piano
                  and rattled off a merry waltz, while the youngest baby on grandma's lap crowed and
                  cooed with delight, and Eva's other two toddlers spun and danced about through the
                     room<pb n="238-239" xml:id="VAC8381-00000120"/> like a pair of fairies out on a
                  spree and wild with poppy dew.</p>
               <p>During this delightful visit, all too short for what was to be enjoyed, the
                  preliminaries for Charlotte's marriage were settled. She would have liked a quiet
                  morning wedding at her father's house, with only the family present. But here
                  Uncle Ames interfered with authority. His heart, he claimed, had adopted Charlotte
                  as his daughter, and she must be married only from his house. Mother Hunter could
                  not be guilty of disputing the fiat of her brother the judge. Eva and Geoffrey
                  declared on Uncle Ames's side, as was natural, they being fond of dash, and show,
                  and royal display, while Charlotte's own grateful heart, mindful of many favors
                  received, admitted that her uncle had earned some right to dictate. Thus it
                  happened that, while the dashing Geoffrey and the wealthy young Zell had been so
                  quietly wedded in the solemn old church, with only those few stray and two secret
                  witnesses, those grave students, Charlotte and Oliver, entered upon their new life
                  with all the fashion and style that Uncle Ames's taste or money could compass.
                  Fred Gay, who had kept his pledge to Charlotte and was now prospering in business
                  more wonderfully than ever, was one of the groomsmen, and made the bride her
                  costliest present.</p>
               <p>It was hardly worth while, Charlotte thought, all this flourish and display to
                  usher in the quiet, bookish life she would lead with her Oliver; more fitting
                  prelude would have been the sacred words softly spoken in the Gothic church, with
                  the broken rainbows lying on seat and floor, and that clear-voiced bird that had
                  lost its way floating under the high-pointed roof to sing the epithalamium.</p>
               <p>But, as usual, Charlotte was pleasing everybody else first, and thinking of
                  herself last of all; and we may safely say that Oliver cared for nothing but to
                  make sure of his Charlotte.</p>
               <p>One stipulation was made—there was to be no wine at the wedding.</p>
               <p>"I will have no drunkards made by my marriage," said Charlotte.</p>
               <pb n="240-241" xml:id="VAC8381-00000121"/>
               <p>"No wine!" cried Eva.</p>
               <p>"No wine!" echoed Aunt Ames in consternation.</p>
               <p>"No wine!" groaned Miss Ames. "But Charlotte has said so, and you might as well
                  try to shake a mountain as to alter Charlotte's mind."</p>
               <p>"It really seems unlady-like to be so resolute," said our dear Eva, who could show
                  fight valorously for a new gown or gewgaw.</p>
               <p>And, after all, there was a wedding without wine, and the guests went home as wise
                  and happy as when they came, and Oliver and Charlotte, in stepping into their new
                  estate, had not trampled on anybody's heart.</p>
               <p>Just outside of the New World's Babel, the noisy city of Gotham, Oliver Alden had
                  established his pleasant dwelling. There was comfort without ostentation,
                  simplicity without meagreness; may be, it had an added advantage to Charlotte, in
                  that it was on the side of the city and on the line of road lying toward
                  Geoffrey's abode.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey was established at housekeeping and in his new profession. Zell had
                  purchased a beautiful country-seat, and furnished it with everything that was
                  supposed to please Geoffrey, unless, indeed, those naughty and dangerous drinks in
                  which he had formerly delighted and which Zell would have none of.</p>
               <p>The grounds about this home were charming; in the stables were horses of the best
                  breed, in the coach-house all necessary vehicles for use or pleasure. Servants
                  were plenty and well ordered. The lines had fallen to Geoffrey in pleasant places:
                  he had truly a goodly heritage. But with the strange obstinacy which is the
                  destruction of so many souls, our Geoffrey failed to see that the goodness of God
                  should lead him to repentance. The jolly Geoffrey worked or amused himself,
                  studied or idled, bounding all his hopes and plans by this earthly horizon which
                  grows narrower with every departing day.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
               <p>DESPITE all Zell's precautions, the demon of strong drink gained an entrance to
                  her home, coming slowly at first, and insidiously, in the guise of friend and
                  physician; for, while Geoffrey had formerly claimed that a glass of liquor was
                  needful to cement good-fellowship, he now asserted that he had in the study of his
                  new profession ascertained beyond a doubt that varieties of intoxicating drinks
                  were potent remedial agents to physic every ill that flesh is heir to.</p>
               <p>It was impossible to make a recluse of the jolly Geoffrey. He loved society, and
                  he loved therein to escort the wife who was his idol. Zell endeavored in the
                  selection of friends and the acceptance of invitations to keep as near the safe
                  side as possible; yet, after all, through the culpability of hosts not wise enough
                  or brave enough to banish inebriating cups, Geoffrey by times fell into
                  snares.</p>
               <p>"Please, Geoffrey," said Zell, "do always refuse wine or brandy, and take lemonade
                  or coffee with me. It would be setting a better example to younger men, and, if
                  people in our position set themselves against these cruel customs of drinking,
                  they would soon be banished."</p>
               <p>"My darling child," replied Geoffrey, pulling her curls, "it is not my forte to be
                  a reformer. When Charlotte and I came into the world together, that unpleasant
                  part was assigned to her. She runs a tilt against everything naughty;
                     <emph>I</emph> cheerfully float with the stream."</p>
               <p>"Oh! but, Geoffrey dear," pleaded Zell, "I would feel so much more safe and
                  comfortable if you would only—well, if you would make up your mind never to touch
                  these horrid things."</p>
               <p>"What a charming baby it is!" said Geoffrey good-naturedly. "Wants its husband to
                  make a boor of himself as a standing custom, for fear he will one day be a
                  fool!"</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, Geoffrey, I am not afraid of that," cried Zell, flushing and refusing
                     to<pb n="244-245" xml:id="VAC8381-00000123"/> listen to her fears; "only I
                  thought you might do this when I asked you."</p>
               <p>"Fact is, my angel," still jested Geoffrey, "I am the soul of honor, and could not
                  endure the thoughts of breaking my word; therefore I fear to pledge myself to you
                  on this matter, lest, being overtempted by the claims of friendship or necessity,
                  I should forget my promise."</p>
               <p>Zell, therefore, went into company with a secret apprehension that very greatly
                  interfered with her entire enjoyment. There was a gnawing worm in the heart of the
                  blossom of her life, its present work unseen, yet to be unfolded as the years went
                  on.</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey! O Geoffrey! what have you done!" cried Zell, about six months after
                  their marriage, as she saw the servant carrying a hamper of wine into the
                  house.</p>
               <p>"My love, it is nothing but a few dozen of port and of the very rarest quality,"
                  replied Geoffrey blandly.</p>
               <p>"But how could you bring it here when you know I do not like it?" said Zell with
                  tears in her eyes; and then added, with a decision worthy of Charlotte's self, "I
                  have always resolved never to admit wine on our table, Geoffrey."</p>
               <p>"What a little empress it is!" shouted Geoffrey, laughing; "taken a new style
                  entirely, and becomes it most amazingly. There, my dear, I am not such a beast as
                  to bring anything on the table which you do not like, nor in any way to interfere
                  with your housekeeping. I got the wine, Zell, entirely for medicinal purposes, and
                  shall keep it sacredly for that use. I have, as you know, frequently patients at
                  the house, and often prefer to put up my own prescriptions, and port wine is many
                  times needed—improves the flavor and efficiency. Into the office that goes, dear,
                  and you won't be bothered with it at all."</p>
               <p>A swift thought that the office might be the most dangerous place possible for the
                  port wine, came into Zell's mind, but she did not like to hint a suspicion or a
                  distrust of this dear Geoffrey. She twisted a fragrant twig of geranium into the
                  button-hole of his vest, as she said coaxingly, "<emph>You</emph> won't<pb
                     n="246-247" xml:id="VAC8381-00000124"/> take the hateful stuff, will you, Geof?
                  I know you don't need any medicine. Let us go and make it all up in prescriptions
                  at once. We'll stuff quassia or rhubarb into every bottle!"</p>
               <p>"What a medical genius!" laughed Geoffrey. "Come to dinner, Zell, and never mind.
                  The port is safe enough for all me. I don't want it."</p>
               <p>Indeed, Geoffrey, becoming nearly as popular as a physician as he had always been
                  as a man, was getting known as the "Port-wine Doctor," that being one of his
                  favorite recommendations. Geoffrey was doubtless skillful in his profession. He
                  had a genius that laid open to him the heart of any study upon which he fixed his
                  attention. He was, as we have just stated, popular. People liked a physician who
                  drove up to the door in good style, with a servant at his side; a physician who
                  came dressed with scrupulous neatness and the most elegant taste; who was posted
                  on all the favorite topics of the day, full of merry conceits, and fluent in
                  conversation, always happy, and never in a hurry to present his bill. We do not
                  doubt that the "port wine" added to his popularity.</p>
               <p>Was a patient chilly, aguish, shivering with incipient cold, the doctor's mild
                  prescription was clinched with the advice, "Take as much lemon-punch as you can
                  drink smoking hot, just before you go to bed, and I warrant you'll be better in
                  the morning;" or, "Don't like punch? That does not signify. Hot spiced wine will
                  do equally as well. Use whatever spice is most agreeable."</p>
               <p>To the convalescent, wine whey was recommended as earnestly as beef-tea.</p>
               <p>"A large glass of milk-punch the first thing every morning is what you need,"
                  Geoffrey would say cordially to another patient. "There's a tonic—a tablespoonful
                  three times a day. Go out on horseback as soon as you are able, and don't neglect
                  the punch—the best of milk and the best of liquor to your taste, with an egg well
                  beaten; that will set you up nicely."</p>
               <p>While thus amiably tempting others, our<pb n="248-249" xml:id="VAC8381-00000125"/>
                  hero fell into temptation, betimes, himself. For instance: "I got the brandy you
                  ordered, doctor. Won't you taste it, and see if it is good? I don't know anything
                  about it."</p>
               <p>Or again: "I sent for the whiskey as you advised. The dealer recommended it as a
                  first-rate article; just try it, and give me your opinion of it."</p>
               <p>At another place: "Taking my wine regularly, you see. Have a glass with me,
                  doctor? You mustn't refuse your own prescriptions!"</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey," suggested Zell, "are you not afraid to order so much liquor in your
                  practice? What if you should develop a taste for it in somebody, and so be the
                  means of making a sot?"</p>
               <p>"No fear of it," said Geoffrey. "I should think using it as a medicine would be an
                  antidote for taking it as a luxury. Did you never hear of a nation where, to keep
                  the children from becoming drunkards, the mothers give them a cup of liquor with a
                  little electric eel or fish, or wretch of some sort, in it, that gives the poor
                  child a shock, and so fills him with awe of the potion ever after?"</p>
               <p>"But, Geoffrey, you don't put a '<emph>wretch</emph>' in it. You have it done up
                  in just the nicest way to make folks like it."</p>
               <p>"O simplicity!" said Geoffrey. "Don't you see, if I gave nauseous potions all the
                  time, people would be afraid to send for me? Besides, according to your theory,
                  the wine or whiskey is wretch enough on its own account. Your keen vision can
                  detect an awful-looking little devil lying snug on the bottom of each glass, and
                  ready to leap down the throat, take possession of the heart, and then raise the
                  mischief."</p>
               <p>Though Geoffrey did not now spend evenings or nights in feasting and drinking, as
                  he had done in New York, he was still slowly taking the downward way. He was so
                  fond of Zell that he never wearied of her society, and suffered only necessity to
                  call him from her side; yet, with all this fondness, he gave no heed to her
                  dearest wish.</p>
               <p>There was not a day now when Geoffrey did not take more or less glasses of
                     wine,<pb n="250-251" xml:id="VAC8381-00000126"/> whiskey, or brandy. With a
                  friend, with a patient, before a cold drive, after a series of fatiguing visits,
                  alone in his office when he was studying, after dinner to aid digestion—these were
                  the times and the reasons that were making havoc with Geoffrey. Nobody could say
                  he got drunk. His hand did not tremble, but sometimes his eyes were overbright,
                  and his tongue moved more swiftly, even, than usual, while queer conceits showed
                  the influence of the stimulant he had used. He grew fleshy and florid, and pointed
                  to this as proof of exceeding good health and of the wisdom of his ways.</p>
               <p>Zell noted all. Her heart ached over it; she shed secret tears. Her dearest hope
                  for Geoffrey, that he should conquer for ever this evil habit, become a Christian,
                  and walk with her toward heaven, was perishing. Zell had set her love on one who
                  was of the earth, earthy. Charlotte, coming at times to visit her brother, saw the
                  change in him. Knowing all the wretchedness and horror of the past, Charlotte
                  could in private remonstrate more plainly and forcibly with Geoffrey than Zell
                  could. "Remember, Geof. where all this led you before. Think on the grief that
                  fell to my share. Such trouble would kill Zell. Can you dare the risk of bringing
                  it upon her?"</p>
               <p>"I'm, safe enough, Charley. Zell is my security. My best sister, I most solemnly
                  assure you that I have not been drunk once since I first went to Gray's, and I
                  never mean to be. It was beastly of me. I recall it with shame. I repent a dozen
                  times a day of it, if I remember it so often. I am master of myself now, Charley,
                  and I mean to keep so."</p>
               <p>"Still, Geoffrey, if you have the habit at all, on some sudden emergency it might
                  get the better of you. In some trial—"</p>
               <p>"There, there, Charley darling, you will make me blue, and disturb the admirable
                  serenity of my nature. Give to the winds your fears, my dear girl: they will never
                  be realized."</p>
               <p>"When trial comes," said Charlotte. And, alas! trials came—came to this Geoffrey
                  who so long had sailed in a pleasure-boat on summer seas.</p>
               <pb n="252-253" xml:id="VAC8381-00000127"/>
               <p>To reach it, we pass over eight years from that happy June that smiled upon his
                  marriage. They had been bright, glad years in the main, but each filled for Zell
                  with a vague uneasiness, and these last two had brought hours of more poignant
                  sorrow. From smilingly calling Geoffrey the "Portwine Doctor," people had come to
                  say that he drank too much; to hope he was "safe;" to insinuate that he was not at
                  all times master of his own words and acts; and this very Good Fellow had been
                  sought for through the house once or twice in the nighttime by Zell, and found in
                  his library, in a deep slumber that had a shameful meaning. The giant habit was
                  regaining full sway; ruin was imminent; for Geoffrey, temporal and eternal ruin;
                  for Zell, the destruction of her dearest hopes. But now, with the close of this
                  eighth year of her married life, came to Zell a call—a call out of this world of
                  mingled good and evil. Zell heard, and straightway set her house in order.
                  Geoffrey would not hear. For any other patient Geoffrey could have seen the
                  danger; but, while he surrounded his wife with every comfort and with every care,
                  he would not admit that she was departing from him. And now this gentle,
                  child-like Zell grew brave—brave beyond earth's heroes; brave with the great
                  courage of those who are conquerors over the best of all our enemies; brave with
                  those good victors who go up higher to receive a crown of rejoicing. Paler yet
                  lovelier every day grew Zell. And first the walks were ended, and then the rides,
                  and then she came no more slowly and quietly down the broad stairway, gliding
                  about like a little ghost in white. After this she passed no more from room to
                  room; and then lay calmly all day on a couch, between two windows open, that she
                  might breathe the sweet June air which she craved.</p>
               <p>"You'll believe it now, my poor, dear Geoffrey, and you'll send for Charlotte,"
                  said Zell, feeling that at last the truth he hated must have come home to her
                  husband.</p>
               <p>When Zell had laid down life's activities one by one, Geoffrey had also put aside
                     by<pb n="254-255" xml:id="VAC8381-00000128"/> degrees the cares of business. At
                  first he refused to go out of nights or for long distances; then he visited only a
                  few patients daily, bidding the rest call in other aid; and now, when Zell was a
                  prisoner on the couch between the windows, Geoffrey refused to leave her side at
                  all. His practice all passed into other hands; he had but one thought, one work,
                  that was to linger and catch every look and word from her whom he was surely
                  losing.</p>
               <p>If Zell spoke a syllable of death, if she essayed a word of advice or of direction
                  concerning what should be after she had left him, poor Geoffrey interrupted her
                  with passionate emotion. He could not hear her, she must not speak on this bitter
                  theme; and if she sought to turn his thoughts heavenward, that he might take hold
                  of strong consolation, he implored her to forbear and not break his heart with the
                  reminder that God was rending from him all he loved or lived for. He refused what
                  comfort God was willing to give him in his woe. Unconscious of his selfishness, he
                  also refused Zell the happiness of feeling that his sorrow would be blessed to
                  him, that by this apparent separation they should be brought nearer together, that
                  a penitent Geoffrey would turn his face to the heaven whereto she had been lifted.
                  Instead of this, Zell feared, with reason, that, deprived of the restraints of her
                  love and company, Geoffrey would seek to drown his misery in strong drink, and
                  wildly deliver himself to destruction. When she essayed to point out this danger
                  and to entreat him to forswear for ever this fatal cup, Geoffrey would reply in
                  this fashion: She need not fear; he could not and would not survive her; he would
                  die on her grave. It was idle to think of his loving intoxicating drinks; he could
                  love nothing when she was gone. Then he would beseech her to fight for life, to do
                  battle with death for his sake, for him to take courage and recover. She must not
                  leave him. And then he would upbraid God for cruelty in parting them, and, seeing
                  her pained, would implore her pardon and protest that he would die when she
                  died.</p>
               <pb n="256-257" xml:id="VAC8381-00000129"/>
               <p>Zell's earthly hope lay in Charlotte, and she was so thankful when that good
                  sister arrived. Charlotte came clad in mourning; it had been her garb mostly for
                  these last six years. She had had children, but each had been taken in its
                  earliest life, and the little ones slept in Greenwood, while the mother's heart
                  was desolate, and, despite her husband and her books, Charlotte, like Rizpah, sat
                  down in sackcloth, and, like Rachel, refused to be comforted.</p>
               <p>The change in Geoffrey shocked Charlotte quite as much as the danger of Zell. Deep
                  lines of grief were traced over Geoffrey's hitherto joyous face. His hair and
                  beard were wild and neglected; his eyes at times fierce, at others filled with
                  unutterable agony. His manner had lost all its old <foreign xml:lang="FRA"
                     >bonhomie,</foreign> his speech was abrupt and disconnected. In truth, while
                  all went well with him, Geoffrey had recklessly sapped the foundations of his
                  mental and physical strength, and now in his hour of trouble he was weak and
                  broken.</p>
               <p>Oliver Alden drew Geoffrey out to the lawn with him, and Charlotte and Zell were
                  left alone.</p>
               <p>"Dear sister," said Zell, "God is calling me away, and I leave them with you. It
                  seems as if they will need you both alike; see how my poor Geoffrey is
                  changed."</p>
               <p>She pulled the bell-cord, and the nurse came in with her child—a laughing,
                  dimpled, springing cherub, some six months old—and placed the little creature
                  beside her mother. Zell's wasted fingers stroked the golden rings of hair on the
                  baby head, wistfully touched the loops of ribbon in the sash and sleeves, and with
                  mother's care mechanically smoothed the dainty white frock. Tears trembled in her
                  eyes.</p>
               <p>"Take her, dear Charlotte," she said; "she is the most precious thing I have, and
                  I give her to you; you will take care of her for poor Geoffrey, so that he will
                  feel he has something left to live for, and she will comfort you. I think you are
                  very lonesome, Charlotte."</p>
               <p>Charlotte was lonesome, and she grasped this little child as a gift direct from
                  heaven. It was evident that the babe would never<pb n="258-259"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000130"/> lack for motherly care or devotion, and, seeing the
                  child so safe, and that Charlotte would be happier, Zell almost smiled.</p>
               <p>"When I am gone," she said, "I want you to try and interest Geoffrey in the baby
                  and in his business. He is neglecting both lately, for he can do nothing but care
                  for me. Oh! if you could only get him to look to God for solace! But, of all
                  things, Charlotte, watch him closely, and see that he does not try to drown his
                  trouble—in sin."</p>
               <p>As Zell spoke, she turned away her face, and looked out of the window.</p>
               <p>"He is preparing himself very poorly for the trial of losing me," she added. "I
                  have been so eager for you, Charlotte, for you can reason with him, while I can
                  only pity."</p>
               <p>The little child was clinging already to its aunt's neck. Charlotte could not
                  speak just then, but she held Zell's white, thin hand in a close grasp. The light
                  of the departing day fell over the group.</p>
               <lg type="quotation">
                  <l>"I saw, wherever light illumineth,</l>
                  <l>Beauty and anguish, walking, hand in hand,</l>
                  <l>The downward slope to death."</l>
               </lg>
               <p>It was the old story so often repeated in this world of parting; they were
                  lingering, a lonely band, on the brink of the river, where only one might cross,
                  and yet it was the glad story of faith made perfect, of peace unutterable, of a
                  welcome in waiting, and angels come for conduct to the farther shore, which, after
                  all, lies not so very far away.</p>
               <p>In those next few days Charlotte learned too well what Zell's warning had implied.
                  Geoffrey scarcely tasted food; he loathed it, and would not eat; but again and
                  again, during twenty-four hours, he would rush to his library, and, from his
                  secret supply, renew a spurious strength with fiery stimulants. He did not realize
                  that Zell understood what he was doing; that it pained her last hours. But perhaps
                  we are wrong to say pained, for God had removed all thorns from her pillow, had
                  filled her with perfect peace, and her dying was like the breaking of the day,
                  when cloud after cloud is parted and lifted from the brightening horizon, when the
                  moonlight pales before the morning, and the day-star wanes before the coming sun.
                     So<pb n="260-261" xml:id="VAC8381-00000131"/> Zell, her earthly labor
                  mysteriously ended, was lifted upward into light and rejoicing; her feet to stand
                  in even places, her hands to gather thornless flowers, and not a cloud, or fear,
                  or chill regret to mar the perfect brightness of her eternal days.</p>
               <p>And, now, here was Geoffrey, the man who had hoped, and planned, and lived only
                  for this lower world, and his idol had been taken into a sphere beyond that where
                  his thoughts had been wont to dwell. He could not follow her with the Christian's
                  faith and bright anticipation. Lo! here was a man who made not God his trust, and
                  his trial was his ruin. About the fair image that had once been Zell he hung,
                  until she was hidden for ever from his sight, then, refusing all sympathy and
                  every attempt at consolation, he locked himself in his library, and, in the
                  wretchedness of his despair, drank to intoxication.</p>
               <p>Day succeeded day, and Geoffrey's only desire seemed to be to keep himself
                  stupefied; he dreaded the return of reason, and his first coming to consciousness
                  was marked by deeper drinking than before. He was deaf to the remonstrances of
                  Charlotte, indifferent to the smiling child they brought to win him from
                  himself.</p>
               <p>"When we are sure he is unconscious," said Mr. Alden to Charlotte, "we will have
                  him carried to his room. Apart from these stimulants, he will return to himself,
                  and I will go after Doctor Gray, who will probably be able to manage him."</p>
               <p>Doctor Gray thought he had never seen so miserable a spectacle as when he stood
                  beside Geoffrey's bed, and Charlotte partially drew back the window-curtain that
                  he might look upon her brother's face—old, wan, haggard, furrowed with
                  sorrow-lines, even in his sleep you could see his overshadowing despair.</p>
               <p>"This," thought Doctor Gray—"this is unblessed affliction; here is, indeed, the
                  bitterness of grief."</p>
               <p>"What will you do for him?" asked Charlotte anxiously. "I am afraid he will become
                  insane."</p>
               <p>"I shall make him comfortable," said<pb n="262-263" xml:id="VAC8381-00000132"/>
                  Doctor Gray. "Give him some nourishment as soon as he rouses, and then try to keep
                  him asleep for twenty-four hours. The poor fellow's nervous system is completely
                  exhausted. Sleepless hours and that abominable poison, instead of food or drink,
                  have done all this."</p>
               <p>On the third day after this, Geoffrey awoke from a refreshing slumber. His frantic
                  grief had for the time yielded to a subdued melancholy. He was like one recovering
                  from a long illness, his energy exhausted, able only to rest and yield like a
                  little child.</p>
               <p>The tireless Doctor Gray was seated at his side.</p>
               <p>"If you had let me alone, doctor," said Geoffrey in quiet reproach, "I should now
                  have been out of this vile world."</p>
               <p>"Could I have let you slip away from us when I was not sure you would have been
                  benefited by the exchange, my friend? He who is really ready to die is also ready
                  to live, if God wills it."</p>
               <p>"What is better for me now than to die?" said Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"To live and work for the world. It yet remains for you to be good and to do good.
                  There is no surer way of finding consolation for ourselves than in healing the
                  wounds of others."</p>
               <p>"<emph>You</emph> might find solace so, but not I," said Geoffrey moodily. "There
                  is a great difference between us: your religion makes it. I do not doubt that you
                  are the nobler and better man; but religion does not touch me, does not appeal to
                  me. It did once years ago, but latterly I have only cared to be happy while I
                  lived, and now I only long to die. Work, doctor, do you say? I can't work without
                  Zell. Live! how can I live without my wife? Do good! why should I, when all that
                  was a good to me has perished?"</p>
               <p>"But, my friend," said Hector Gray soothingly, "other men have been tried as you
                  have, have lost wives, and have been able to see them not lost, but set apart for
                  a little time, and have learned to follow them up toward God."</p>
               <p>"I can't feel so," said Geoffrey fiercely.<pb n="264-265"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000133"/> "When she died, a great blackness settled down
                  between us two, through which I cannot go to her nor she return to me."</p>
               <p>"I tell you, Geoffrey," said Doctor Gray, "before prayer offered in the name of
                  Christ, that blackness will disappear like mist before the morning. Besides,
                  Geoffrey, you have your little daughter to think of."</p>
               <p>"She is safe," said Geoffrey; "she has money plenty, and Charlotte will take care
                  of her any way."</p>
               <p>As Geoffrey recovered strength and came among his family again, his gloom did not
                  disappear. The same hostility that had risen in him against the law after his
                  failure and disgrace in New York, now woke against his medical profession. He
                  refused to practise any longer. What was the use of a science or an art that had
                  not been able to save his Zell? Every sick-bed recalled her death; every patient
                  set his loss more plainly before his mind. No! medicine was a cruel, a deceitful,
                  a wicked sham of a profession. When it was mentioned, he would throw himself into
                  a paroxysm of fury over it, and as he seemed, moreover, on the verge of insanity,
                  no one dared to dispute him.</p>
               <p>We do not wish to insinuate that Geoffrey's mental danger was purely the result of
                  his great loss. Not so; other men have loved as ardently, have lost as completely,
                  have sorrowed as profoundly as Geoffrey; but Geoffrey, by his reckless and sinful
                  course, had heaped up retribution for himself; he was the prey of remorse as well
                  as of grief, and he had denied himself God's comforts and the light that might now
                  shine upon his darkness.</p>
               <p>Not only did Geoffrey now reject the profession which he had embraced with such
                  ardor, but he abhorred the home where he had been so happy.</p>
               <p>While a large portion of Zell's property had been settled on her child, the baby
                  Zell, the house and all it contained, or that belonged in any way to it, were
                  bequeathed to Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>This he resolved to sell. He desired Charlotte to select and forward to her own
                  home all those things which were most<pb n="266-267" xml:id="VAC8381-00000134"/>
                  closely connected with his lost wife. The rest he would dispose of, that he might
                  have less to remind him of his bereavement.</p>
               <p>"I would rent and not sell," said Charlotte. "One day your feelings may be so
                  changed or softened that you may desire to return."</p>
               <p>"No, never!" said Geoffrey. "You must come up here several times a year to look
                  after that little spot yonder by the church; and, whenever I am lucky enough to
                  die, bring me here and put me beside her."</p>
               <p>"Dear brother, I'm afraid you will repent when you have sold this loved and
                  beautiful home."</p>
               <p>"I've made up my mind, Charlotte. I shall have what home can now be for me on
                  earth with you, unless you cut me adrift—and then I shall go to the dogs."</p>
               <p>"My Geoffrey, you are as welcome in my house as I am myself. You know that. Do you
                  think a visit home to father's would be good for you? I'll go with you, if you say
                  so."</p>
               <p>"No," said Geoffrey testily; "I don't want to go home. They'll be asking questions
                  no end, and talking, talking. Say no more about that, Charley."</p>
               <p>He exhibited the same strange sensitiveness about his little daughter as about
                  other things, though, at her birth, he had rejoiced to name her Zell after her
                  mother. He now ignored the name, and pertinaciously called her <hi rend="i"
                  />Nellie, desiring every one else to do so, and seemed to find satisfaction in
                  persuading himself that the child in very deed belonged to Charlotte.</p>
               <p>Alden and Charlotte both trembled at the thought of taking Geoffrey with them near
                  to the city, where life to him had once before proved so dangerous. There seemed
                  no other course left. Alden could not be very long absent from his business;
                  Charlotte did not wish to leave him alone to the tender mercies of the servants,
                  and poor, distracted Geoffrey she evidently could not abandon.</p>
               <p>Two months after Zell had been taken from them, the home was disposed of. Geoffrey
                  turned gloomily from the place where he had been so happy, and, a dreary,<pb
                     n="268-269" xml:id="VAC8381-00000135"/> repining, broken-spirited man,
                  rebellious against God, who had so long dealt so very tenderly with him, his once
                  generous, jovial heart now as a well of bitterness, he entered Charlotte's
                  dwelling, himself, while pitied and fondly loved, yet from his errors a shadow and
                  a nightmare even in that freely accorded home.</p>
               <p>From Charlotte as from Geoffrey the buoyancy of youth had gone, while her brother
                  was as well loved as in any of the years gone by. Her hopes were crushed, and she
                  was more ready than before to grieve and despond.</p>
               <p>To occupy Geoffrey's mind, and keep him away from the temptations of the city, was
                  Charlotte's chief desire.</p>
               <p>He had always taken great delight in the pursuit of chemistry, and had brought,
                  or, rather, his sister had brought for him, to her house, his valuable library and
                  apparatus. In earlier years, Charlotte had shared his readings, his experiments,
                  and researches; the old study had a real charm for her, and she strove by her
                  interest to win Geoffrey from his miserable brooding over his troubles. There were
                  times when she seemed to have succeeded; comfortable days when he thought, and
                  reasoned, and argued on favorite topics, with something of his former brilliancy.
                  Then gloom, deeper than before, settled over him; he would either rave fiercely or
                  be sullenly silent, refuse food, and then seek oblivion in deep draughts of
                  brandy.</p>
               <p>Charlotte's life was full of apprehensions; she feared at one time that her
                  brother would destroy himself, or, at another, that, in a fit of insanity, he
                  might take other lives besides his own. The passing weeks were as a season of
                  furious storms, with only ominous lulls between.</p>
               <p>For the first time, Oliver Alden knew not what he ought to do; he pitied his
                  brother-in-law; he sympathized with Charlotte; and, more than this, he saw
                  Charlotte's health wearing away in these anxieties. Sometimes he wished Geoffrey
                  might be sent to an asylum before Charlotte's health should be completely
                  destroyed. In these days of<pb n="270-271" xml:id="VAC8381-00000136"/> darkness,
                  the little Nellie, for so only would her father permit her to be called, was a ray
                  of sunshine. The child grew apace in beauty and sweetness like her mother, and,
                  watching her baby glee, Charlotte loved to trace resemblances to the darling
                  little room-mate of the far-off school-days.</p>
               <p>From this loving sister and this winsome babe, Geoffrey would turn and lose
                  himself somewhere in the city for days, coming home gaunt and woe-begone, bearing
                  the indubitable marks of hard drinking.</p>
               <p>He had returned once thus, and gone to his room in silence, when, coming
                  down-stairs for some errand, he found Charlotte had thrown herself on the library
                  sofa, and was weeping bitterly. The sight touched him; he stood in the doorway
                  irresolute for a few moments, then, coming nearer, he said softly:</p>
               <p>"These tears for me, my Charley?"</p>
               <p>"O Geoffrey!" cried Charlotte, "why will you go away so, and do what you know is
                  wrong?—do what will ruin you, body and soul?"</p>
               <p>"What pity," groaned Geoffrey, "that I have lived to be your curse, when you have
                  been my life-long blessing!"</p>
               <p>"The remedy is in your own hands, my Geoffrey. Be the man God meant you to be.
                  Show yourself worthy of the dear one you have lost. Be a father of whom your child
                  may be proud. O my brother! because sorrow has come to you, do not make others
                  wretched. Is it not worthier, Geoffrey, out of our sufferings to bring balm to
                  others? You are allowing trial to destroy you, when, in its legitimate work, it
                  would ennoble you, and so add a blessing to the world. You say I have always loved
                  you; then, for my sake, Geoffrey, shake off this terrible habit."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey bowed his head, and sighed deeply. "Charley, you cannot understand in
                  what chains I am bound. I do not know if I can leave this off. But this shall be
                  the last time I return to cause you such grief. I will not again come back to be
                  only a disgrace."</p>
               <p>Charlotte started up, and clasped her arms<pb n="272-273"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000137"/> about his neck. "Strive, pray, conquer if you can,
                  my Geoffrey; but never fear to return even if you have failed; always come back,
                  and let us help you to try again."</p>
               <p>There was, after this, an unusually long period of peace. Alden and his wife had
                  begun to take heart, when the morbid fit came again on Geoffrey—fasting, gloom,
                  stolid silence; a burst of fury if aroused; sleepless nights; and before Doctor
                  Gray, for whom Mr. Alden had sent in his despair, could arrive, Geoffrey had
                  eluded their vigilance, and was gone they know not whither.</p>
               <p>Days passed, and he came not. Doctor Gray returned home. Oliver Alden became sure
                  that his brother-in-law was not in New York. Charlotte, at times, believed that he
                  had committed suicide, and, unknown even to her husband, again and again, when it
                  was advertised that a body had been found, did she go to see if the dead one were
                  her brother. Many a ghastly corpse thus met her eyes, and water-soaked or
                  blood-stained garments were laid before her for identification, and each time she
                  came away relieved of the apprehension that <emph>this</emph> lost wretch might be
                  her brother, yet with a sharp despair gnawing at her heart.</p>
               <p>On Charlotte's last expedition of this kind, she felt almost sure, from the
                  description on the slip of paper she had placed in her pocket-book, that her
                  search would now be ended in finding Geoffrey—dead, but she could then bury her
                  grief, and this hungry fear would tear at her life no longer.</p>
               <p>"The drownded corp, ma'am? This way. It's a fearsome sight for a lady. Yon's the
                  room; I'll bring you there," said a rough man, who stood waiting at the outer
                  door.</p>
               <p>Muffled in her veil, Charlotte followed him into a narrow, dreary, ill-lighted
                  room, where a fearful something lay stretched out on a plank, supported by
                  trestles. Stumbling behind her came the feet of men bringing a coarse coffin for
                  him who had been "found drowned." It was only when Charlotte lifted her heavy veil
                  that she might look on this dead face, that she saw that some one stood at the
                  body's head, and a voice of pity and dismay cried out "Charlotte<pb n="274-275"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000138"/> lotte!" It was her husband, and, as he hastily gave
                  her his arm, he said:</p>
               <p>"This is not Geoffrey, my poor child."</p>
               <p>"You saw what I did, then, and thought it was Geoffrey?"</p>
               <p>"Yes; and then, when I came, I stopped to take a few notes that might be of
                  service for some one else. You must come no more errands like this,
                  Charlotte."</p>
               <p>"It seemed easier to come than to wait for some one else to tell me. It is so hard
                  to sit at home and wait for evil tidings," said Charlotte wearily.</p>
               <p>Alden marked her pale, worn face and heavy eyes. Something must surely be done to
                  relieve the strain that was proving too great even for this strong, courageous
                  heart.</p>
               <p>"I went there," said Alden to his wife that evening, "because it was well to be
                  sure. But I have no idea that Geoffrey is dead. I have men on the lookout
                  everywhere. If he gets back to New York, I shall be on hand; if he turns up at
                  your Uncle Ames's, I have instructed them. Now, what I want you to do is, to take
                  the little one and go to your father's. There is so much <emph>heart</emph> in
                  Geoffrey, such a fund of affection, that I feel sure he will come to himself, and
                  long to see his friends, his relatives, those that love him. He will be drawn to
                  old-time scenes, to familiar places; he will be hungry for sympathy and a welcome
                  somewhere; he will be home-sick, and I believe will find his way back to his home
                  and his mother. The voice of the Happy River will call him in his dreams; he will
                  be thirsty for the spring where he drank when a boy. He will long for the old-time
                  room and for his mother's words. Your prodigal will return, Charlotte; if you go
                  there, he will come some day. This is the greatest trial of your life, and it
                  calls for the greatest bravery. You must make up your mind not only to be patient,
                  but to be cheerful. It will not make matters better to pine and fade away. I need
                  you, and the little one needs you. You must be true to yourself as you have always
                  been."</p>
               <p>Yes, Charlotte saw that. It was not well<pb n="276-277" xml:id="VAC8381-00000139"
                  /> to let the blasting influence of Geoffrey's distorted life through her fall
                  upon the man she loved.</p>
               <p>The earth was all lovely with the spring-time; health and cheer were borne on the
                  wings of every breeze. Charlotte's heart responded to the voice of nature; it
                  returned to rest and hope. She was going to her early home—a home that was sad for
                  Geoffrey. She must lighten their gloom, and not add to it.</p>
               <p>Alden's predictions about Geoffrey seemed to Charlotte to make her brother's
                  return certain. Oliver was a man so seldom mistaken, he had been proved right so
                  many times, that Charlotte could not help feeling sure that she was going home,
                  soon to find her brother following her.</p>
               <p>The noise, the care, the strange contrasts, the crimes, the woes, the stirring
                  business of the city, were left behind. Charlotte went where she heard only the
                  birds chirping to each other across the rippling stream, the cattle lowing home
                  through the lanes, the lambs calling after their placid mothers, the laborers
                  talking of their homely toils and of the coming crop. Here was the well-known
                  homestead, spreading out wings and additions in a fashion that showed land was not
                  a matter of consideration. Here were Eva's children, frisky and full of play as
                  kittens. Here was Eva, such a wonderful house-keeper now. Here was the
                  white-haired father, who strolled over his farm, questioned his men, and for the
                  rest, leaving work and supervision to Eva's husband, sat on the porch on the sunny
                  side of the house, and, with his chair tilted back against the window, where his
                  wife kept up a ceaseless knitting, read his papers, advertisements and all, not
                  less than three times through. Here was that dear, faithful, tender old mother,
                  whose household occupations had gradually slipped into Eva's nimbler hands, now
                  sitting in her well-cushioned chair, always taking the part of any obstreperous
                  grandchild who had come to grief, her knitting-needles and her tongue alike
                  untiring, and now, as ever since Charlotte's eyes had seen the light, using two
                  pairs of spectacles.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
               <p>"HIM as rode past a bit ago is coming back, Tony. He rides like a man as knew not
                  what to do. He's like to get a wetting if he don't turn in somewhere, and a
                  thunderstorm coming up. A likely man, but rides as if the world was dead and he a
                  dragging after its funeral."</p>
               <p>Tony had looked out of the window, between the dusty heads of the owl and the
                  'possum, as his aunt began to speak—looked and kept looking until the despondent
                  rider had passed by; then jumped over his counter, jarring the ragged-tailed
                  squirrel who had shammed to gnaw the same nut these many years, darted out of the
                  door, and ran lightly along until he was abreast of the stranger.</p>
               <p>"A thousand 'appy days to you, sir! And might I be so bold as to hask why you
                  passes old friends without the time of day? Haunt Katy and I would be overly
                  pleased with the honor of a call from a gent as we is always proud to mention
                  knowing."</p>
               <p>"As I live," said the stranger, rousing to some degree of animation, as he turned
                  to the well-grown, cheerful-faced young man, "it is Tony Moreland."</p>
               <p>"Always at your service, sir; and glad to see you riding about these parts. And
                  would you pass us by? Haunt Katy's growing old, and would take it more than
                  friendly if you said a good word to her and looked at her birds. She's fond of
                  telling 'ow my huncle 'unted, sir."</p>
               <p>The rider half-reluctantly turned his horse's head, and Tony, still talking, laid
                  his hand on the bridle and led him to the door, where the legend "Taxidermist" and
                  that other legend "Ale and Beer" were grown very dim under sun and rain.</p>
               <p>"It's Mr.—begging 'is pardon—Doctor Geoffrey, Haunt Katy. Not above stopping with
                  us for a bit; and well you did, sir, for ere come the big drops; and I'll lead the
                  'orse under shelter for you."</p>
               <pb n="280-281" xml:id="VAC8381-00000141"/>
               <p>"Glad I am to see you, sir," said the voluble Katy, "and glad I am to know you
                  found them all well at home. Mrs. George,—your sister, sir—was telling me you were
                  travelling, and they were sore anxious you'd come back soon. Never was an old lady
                  held her own like your mother, and the last time I stepped over I saw Mrs. Alden
                  and the little one, and she <emph>is</emph> a beauty now, if ever child was."</p>
               <p>Tony, keener-eyed than his aunt, marked the hungry eagerness of Geoffrey's face
                  for this news from home. He saw that this wanderer had strayed about, longing and
                  yet shrinking, craving a look at his dear ones, yet nervously fearful of going in
                  among them. To Katy, Madam Eva had glossed over her brother's absence with the
                  specious name of travelling; but Charlotte had secretly taken Tony into
                  confidence, and engaged him to keep watch in the neighborhood for her brother's
                  appearance. Tony had been at the farm only the day before, and knew that Geoffrey
                  had not then been seen there; but now, politely ignoring the fact that he had
                  accosted him riding <emph>away</emph> from home, Tony said coolly:</p>
               <p>"The shower's heavy, doctor, and it will keep you from getting home to tea in
                  time. We've a main fine cow, and if Haunt Katy couldn't make chocolate fit for a
                  king, I'd not mention it before you. Yet if you'd be so good as to make yourself
                  at 'ome, and take the chocolate and some 'am and heggs with me and Haunt Katy,
                  sir, we'd be proud of it to the end of our lives."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey seemed inclined to stay, and Katy, quite bewildered by an honor second
                  only to her breakfast at Mrs. Hunter's, hastened to do her very best in preparing
                  supper; and Katy was a cook not to be despised.</p>
               <p>During these years Tony Moreland had not given his time to attending to his aunt's
                  shop: he had worked in the coal-mine during the day and spent his evenings in
                  study. Strong determination to improve himself and a good deal of natural ability
                  had made Tony a very presentable young man. His oddities of dialect were not all
                  lost, but<pb n="282-283" xml:id="VAC8381-00000142"/> Tony's heart was in the right
                  place, and he had strong common sense. His neighbors spoke well of him, and Katy
                  stood a little in awe of her nephew.</p>
               <p>While Katy prepared supper, Tony set himself to entertain his guest, anxious to
                  keep him contented where he was until he was so strongly drawn toward home that he
                  could not think of turning his back upon it.</p>
               <p>"I'm sorry your 'ealth's not good, doctor; you don't look 'earty. Some say
                  travelling is the thing for sick folk, but I'd like to see a place beat your farm
                  for 'ealthiness and cheerfulness. There's your father, a sight good for sad eyes!
                  Don't he look well, now, walking about his farm considering the crops, or tilted
                  back on the side-porch reading the paper! Then them children! Why, you can 'ear
                  them laugh 'alf a mile, I'll be bound. Last time I was up there—you wasn't come
                  'ome then, sir—your mother comes out to the porch, and nothing would do but I must
                  have a glass of milk and a slice of cake. Land, I wa'n't 'ungry, but I 'ad to eat
                  it all the same, she's so 'ospitable! Then there's that spring! Ain't it a picter!
                  I walked round there, and there was a chipmunk whisking along the edge to drink,
                  and the prettiest bobolink darting down to the water, and up again like a flash.
                  Down by the river, sitting on the green bank, I see Mrs. Alden an' the little one.
                  'Here's where my brother used to come with me,' says she. I reckon you'll 'ave a
                  pretty good time of it there, sir, after going about the world to see the sights
                  and get the news."</p>
               <p>Slowly over Geoffrey's sombre face the light had broken. That dear home came
                  before him fair and clear against the background of his happy childhood. Love
                  within him strove for mastery over pride and shame. Could he turn his back on
                  those dear parents who had a welcome even for strangers, and, oh! so much more for
                  him, the only son! Those children! his own child among them—his genial heart was
                  drawn to their innocent glee. Those sisters—one kindly hiding his delinquencies,
                  the other loyally waiting his return.</p>
               <pb n="284-285" xml:id="VAC8381-00000143"/>
               <p>Here Katy, flushed and excited, opened a door, and showed a table neatly set, the
                  linen of her own spinning, the blue-edged plates and cups her special pride, the
                  good things laid thereon the work of her careful hands; for if there was dust in
                  the curious old shop where Katy would not disturb what her Moreland had left,
                  there was dirt nowhere else about the premises.</p>
               <p>The skies had grown darker, and Tony declared they must have a lamp. The low
                  rolling of the thunder had ceased, and the wild rush of great raindrops against
                  the house had changed to a steady pour.</p>
               <p>"A 'eavy rain, sir, but we need it, and it 'll clear by morning. The 'orse is safe
                  'oused and fed, and here's shelter, sir, for you, though it's none too fine. I
                  reckon you'll 'ave to stay all night, it would be a pity to get a drenching.
                  They'll not worry, sir."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey shook his head. Surely they would not worry more than in these months
                  past; they did not know him so near, they did not know how his heart was trembling
                  in the balance, questioning whether he should go or stay. They did not know how
                  Tony's apparently accidental touches at home pictures, his seemingly idle words,
                  were weighing down the scale in favor of those longing hearts.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey had eaten nothing all day, simply because he dreaded stopping where he
                  might be known or questioned. Katy's excellent meal did him abundant good. His
                  spirits rose, life looked brighter than when, faint and hopeless, he despairingly
                  turned his back on home under the gathering clouds. These people were too
                  respectful to question him. They talked cordially, desiring to entertain their
                  guest. Their ready homage came pleasantly to him whom lifelong all men had
                  praised, and he had wandered, oh! so wearily apart from love and reverence.
                  Besides this, Geoffrey's generous spirit was pleased to see people so innocently
                  happy, so easily suited as Tony and his aunt. He had ever been not a cynical, but
                  a genial student of human nature, and he liked to see these people developing
                  their plans and sentiments<pb n="286-287" xml:id="VAC8381-00000144"/> timents, to
                  ponder on a life so different from his own. The little house had been new roofed,
                  an addition of a room made, and this had been furnished as a bedroom, wherein,
                  Katy triumphantly remarked, no one had ever slept, and the carpet was of her own
                  make, and the sheets and blankets were of her own spinning and weaving, and until
                  this spring had been laid up in lavender picked in merry England, while as for the
                  feathers in bed and pillows, they had all been ruthlessly plucked from Katy's
                  geese by Katy's hand. Indeed, it took the good woman nearly all supper-time to
                  describe this new room and its appointments. The reason of her praise was
                  evident—she was about to offer it for the accommodation of her honored guest.</p>
               <p>Returning to the shop, the rain still rattling on the roof, Geoffrey marked that,
                  while all the rest of the house was renovated, this relic of the departed Moreland
                  was untouched. Still from the time-stained rafters hung deer and squirrel skins,
                  still the ground-hog rooted in the box of nails, the owl eyed the widow-moth who
                  perhaps had flown in his company on dark nights long gone, the raccoon grinned
                  until he showed all his teeth, the blackbird overhead threatened to swoop down on
                  the big spider, who <figure/> had grown heedless of his danger in these many
                  years. In the largest case were to be seen a small crane, an oriole, a cedar-bird,
                  and a humming-bird with a throat that blazed in the lamp-light like a
                     carbuncle.<pb n="288-289" xml:id="VAC8381-00000145"/> The beer and whiskey
                  glasses on the battered tray were for the most part unused; the barrels, still
                  turned on their sides, were neglected. Some happy ban rested on Katy's business,
                  and Geoffrey guessed that Tony was responsible therefor.</p>
               <p>Katy came in wiping her hands, having wiped her dishes.</p>
               <p>"That's a gray-throated grebe, sir," said Katy, taking up her favorite theme and
                  pointing to a bird plethoric in body and deficient as to tail. "There is another
                  grebe as has ears—its feathers are perked up to look like ears, that is. This
                  ain't that one, I gave that one to Mrs. Alden. Tony, what are you treading on my
                  toe for? I wish your feet weren't so big. What do you suppose folk here calls that
                  grebe, sir? Why, they calls it a—didipper!" Katy spoke with a scorn sufficient to
                  wither the boobies who misnamed her bird. Tony had trodden on her toe, because he
                  thought she was running on a conversational snag when she mentioned the giving of
                  the bird; but, getting on the didipper track, the good woman steered clear of the
                  danger, and now, pointing to another case, remarked: "Moreland got his death
                  hunting them, too. He did indeed, sir—poor soul! and we was married twenty-one
                  years three weeks and five days."</p>
               <p>"I remember you always seemed very happy together," said Geoffrey kindly.</p>
               <p>"Happy enough, sir; a deal happier than many who thinks theirselves better off.
                  I've never complained of my lot in life, doctor. It's my opinion now and ever,
                  that a poor man who works his day's work is the very happiest man in the world. A
                  poor man has nothing to trouble him but each day's work as it comes; when it's
                  done, there's an end of it. He's no worrit about loss, no worrit about big
                  profits, no worrit about anything."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey's evening did not pass very heavily. He was glad to be resting in mind
                  and body; glad to be reinstated even by this plain pair in his old position of a
                  king among men. He was glad that the question of going home or losing himself<pb
                     n="290-291" xml:id="VAC8381-00000146"/> again in the bitter world need not be
                  just now decided; he might sleep this night at least thinking that the die was not
                  cast; he could go home if he chose. As he took a lamp to go to bed in that new
                  room, Tony said:</p>
               <p>"I have an errand to the farm in the morning, sir, if I might be so bold as to
                  offer you my company, and to trot over by your side on my nag."</p>
               <p>Then, does anybody know why Tony, instead of going to rest in his attic over the
                  kitchen, put the front-door key in his pocket, and stretched himself out on the
                  settle in the shop, into which opened the only door from Geoffrey's room?</p>
               <p>Next morning, when our Geoffrey woke, he heard Tony and his aunt moving and
                  talking in the house. The sun was shining gloriously, and the earth was doubly
                  beautiful after the storm. Our hero lay quiet, thinking for some time; then a
                  restful look came over his face, for he had resolved that morning to go home.</p>
               <p>When Geoffrey went out into the shop, Tony was bustling about there with an
                  appearance of great excitement.</p>
               <p>"You are up early, my friend," said Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"It is seven, sir; and I've been up this three hours. Haunt Katy's making a cup of
                  chocolate again for you, and if I've your leave, I'll ride over to the farm with
                  you—I've an errand to Mr. George. Please you take a look at who's coming."</p>
               <p>"It is old Uncle Terry," cried Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"So it is," said Tony with unusual tartness; "acomin', as he has come this twenty
                  year, for his morning dram. Take a look at him! Wot a wenerable bald 'ead! Wot a
                  fatherly smile! Stepping along like he walked on heggs. Truly thinks he is about
                  as good as they get 'em up, and always has an answer pat if any one accuses
                  him."</p>
               <p>Here Uncle Terry put his benignant, withered old face in at the shop-door, bowed
                  low over his cane, and, as he chirped "Good morning, sirs," Tony briskly addressed
                  him, with wrath increasing with language:</p>
               <p>"Oh! yes; here you are! coming after the<pb n="292-293" xml:id="VAC8381-00000147"
                  /> beggarly elements that go to making fools and fiends, and no end of guys of
                  people. A sensible, <emph>phi</emph>lanthropical, <emph>be</emph>nevolent, an'
                  altogether aggrawating old cove, ain't you, now? Where's Judy, I say?"</p>
               <p>"Well! Judy," responded the patriarch, "why, Judy—oh! Judy was up with the larks,
                  and off for an airing; took a little pleasure excursion, as one may say."</p>
               <p>"It must a' been airy enough," quoth the unquenchable Tony, "scudding under bare
                  poles, with scarce a yard of petticoat; and werry much of a pleasure excursion,
                  chased out the door with a hickory cane. You needn't come here for a tip to
                  enliven your imagination, it's lively beyond believing at this present
                  minute."</p>
               <p>"You'll give me a glass, Tony, sure? I never meant a morsel of harm, but joking;
                  and I'll get the trembles and die without the brandy, Tony. You'll let me have a
                  stiff drink, and Judy shall go back."</p>
               <p>"Judy," said Tony—while Geoffrey eyed the old wretch with disgust—"Judy is tucked
                  up warm in Haunt Katy's bed, and is going to get some hot chocolate. A
                  lively-dispositioned old gentleman, ain't you, now, to have around one? turning
                  folks out-of-doors like that; a cheerful, chirrupy, agreeable old customer to 'ave
                  around one. Judy aint going back to your 'ouse. I'll look after Judy; and I feel
                  some responsible for you, seeing I allowed Aunt Katy to have her way selling
                  whiskey. I'll pay your boarding at the county-house as my share of the business
                  after this, and you needn't be afraid of the trembles, for you'll get a hot
                  breakfast, which you ain't deserving. Mr. Geoffrey, the 'orses are saddled, and
                  your chocolate is ready."</p>
               <p>Tony led the way into the next room, leaving Uncle Terry whimpering in a corner of
                  the settle for the brandy he craved far more than a breakfast—whimpering, and
                  drivelling, and wiping his bleared eyes on his rusty old coat, a wretched
                  spectacle of debased old age.</p>
               <p>Who could describe that home-coming? when all the family rushed out to the porch
                  to meet their Geoffrey; and Tony, simulating unconsciousness of any unusual
                     demonstrations<pb n="294-295" xml:id="VAC8381-00000148"/> strations, trotted
                  quickly round the house. Perhaps Tony did have business with Mr. George, for he
                  rode twice round the barn without seeing anybody, and then, with face as ecstatic
                  as if he had met a hundred choice friends, set out for home.</p>
               <p>Charlotte, who never neglected anything, ran and met him going by the gate.</p>
               <p>"Oh! Tony, how can I ever thank you for your helping me as I know you have!"</p>
               <p>"There now!" cried Tony, and bubbling over with the news he had to tell—"I'm going
                  to have Uncle Terry shut up, and me and Judy are going to get married. I'll put
                  the old chap where he'll be taken care of, but I ain't going to let him abuse Judy
                  any more."</p>
               <p>"Are you going to be married right away?" asked Charlotte.</p>
               <p>"Not afore to-morrow," replied the matter-of-fact youth. "I must get the old man
                  looked after, the first thing."</p>
               <p>That afternoon Aunt Katy heard a great cutting and banging in the sideyard, and,
                  hastening to look, there was Tony breaking up barrels, and jugs, and all that had
                  held cause of offence.</p>
               <p>"Why, lad, boy, Tony! what are you doing?" shrieked Katy.</p>
               <p>"Breaking up your business," said Tony. "There's an end of liquor-selling for good
                  and all. I didn't send for that last liquor you told me to, aunt; so you might as
                  well quit expectin' it. If you want a shop, I'll set up as tidy a little grocery
                  as you may want. Come, now, don't look glum; let's 'ave that shop scrubbed, and
                  them wicious mugs and glasses washed and put by for decent uses. I've broke the
                  whiskey-dealing up now, and I've got the hold man put where 'e'll be safe; and
                  to-morrow there'll be a wedding 'ere, Haunt Katy, and we'll all be 'appy for ever
                  after."</p>
               <p>Aunt Katy couldn't withstand the prospect of a wedding; she went to work to clean
                  away from the shop the traces of her recent business, and Judy helped her with a
                  right good will. Next morning, while Katy was baking some cake and pies, as she
                  thought good for a wedding, and Tony was<pb n="296-297" xml:id="VAC8381-00000149"
                  /> off in the village buying a new suit, Eva and Charlotte drove up in the
                  carriage with a nice trunk strapped on behind.</p>
               <p>The driver carried the trunk into the new bedroom; the sisters convoyed thither
                  the blushing Judy; Katy followed with open mouth and eyes, and, lo! there was such
                  a wardrobe for the bride as Katy's wildest dreams had never conceived.</p>
               <p>Eva did up Judy's hair in her best style, and she and Charlotte dressed the girl
                  in a manner that made the happy Tony almost frantic with delight when he came
                  home; and the clergyman at the village, who that evening married the pair,
                  remarked to his wife that they were as well-looking a couple as one might wish to
                  see.</p>
               <p>"I had a mind never to come home, Charley," said Geoffrey to his sister, when they
                  had strolled off together, and were seated by the river-side. "If it had not been
                  for Tony, and his talk of home, I should have wandered away for the last time, and
                  have been seen no more."</p>
               <p>"And for what?" asked Charlotte.</p>
               <p>"Because I felt I was only a disgrace to you all—a public shame."</p>
               <p>"There you are wrong," said Charlotte. "In the first place, you stand as well
                  before the world as ever you did. Who, beyond one or two close friends, who love
                  you and value you for what you really are, knew anything of the circumstances
                  connected with your leaving the law? Then, as a physician you always stood well,
                  and were successful in your practice; as a student, you are quite well known, and
                  your articles on chemistry have attracted a good deal of attention. You were wrong
                  in New York this last time—very wrong; yet no public disgrace accrued to any of
                  your friends, or even to yourself, for no no one knew it. But when I say
                     <emph>wrong,</emph> I am in error. I consider your habit a misfortune, a
                  disease, rather than a crime. We say to a drinking man, Reform, be sober; we might
                  generally as reasonably say to the fever patient or the consumptive, Be well, and
                  expect him to obey."</p>
               <p>"But, Charlotte," said Geoffrey, turning to her, as he lay on the bank with his
                     head<pb n="298-299" xml:id="VAC8381-00000150"/> supported by his hands, "there
                  is a <emph>sin</emph> in it somewhere—the voice of conscience, of nature,
                  proclaims that; the drunkard knows he is to blame somehow; and yet for particular
                  acts of drunkenness, for individual 'sprees,' as folks call them, he is no more
                  responsible than a maniac. I tell you, Charley, I have seen many a day when I
                  positively <emph>could not help</emph> drinking."</p>
               <p>"I do not doubt it, Geoffrey. The wrong lies in the <emph>beginning:</emph> if we
                  trace very many diseases to their first cause, we shall find a sin lying at the
                  root, and that root not so very far off. I do not mean the great general
                  corruption of our natures, the sin that made us mortal, and death possible; but
                  some known, bold wrong. In how many cases of consumption, palsy, scrofula,
                  epilepsy, insanity, can you fail to point to some positive violation of moral law,
                  and say there was the seed-time, and this is the harvest. A man has no more right,
                  Geoffrey, to take glasses of liquor, and thus begin a disintegrating process in
                  his brain, than he has deliberately to freeze and thaw his legs or his arms, until
                  he has induced mortification, and so destroyed them. The man who turns aside from
                  sobriety, and begins to make a drunkard of himself, is just as guilty as he who is
                  found dead with a fatal bottle, labelled poison, in his hand. If you are looking
                  for a place to begin repenting at, then go back to those early days when you were
                  mind-free, and I warned you to let this ruinous drink alone, and you would not. Do
                  not think I blame you for what has happened at my house, or at your house when we
                  lost Zell; then you were the helpless victim of disease."</p>
               <p>"And a disease of my own making. I do not know but you are right, Charley. Still,
                  when I practised medicine, I believed that alcoholic stimulants were very useful,
                  even absolutely necessary, in fevers, in cases of nervous prostration, debility,
                  or in an incipient cold; and I had high authority on my side, Dr. Todd, for
                  instance, Liebig, Hammond, those doctors at Bellevue, and plenty of others."</p>
               <p>"And you have just as high authority<pb n="300-301" xml:id="VAC8381-00000151"/>
                  against the use of alcoholic drinks in these cases; and the
                     <emph>statistics</emph> are in favor of the opposition; now, you'll admit,
                  Geof, that statistics, carefully collected, are worth more than theories."</p>
               <p>"But, Charlotte, we know that the alcohol itself leaves the system very rapidly;
                  now, why not suppose that it carries with it a portion of the disease, of the
                     <emph>malaria,</emph> if we may call it so, of the system?"</p>
               <p>"Why not admit the fact that it leaves the system demoralized, vitiated, open to
                  injuries, and, from the subtle connection between the physical and moral part of
                  our natures, leaves the mind deteriorated, and ready to seek that as a pleasure
                  which was falsely given as a remedy."</p>
               <p>"Dr. Marcet says," remarked Geoffrey meditatively, "that 'there exists in the
                  substance of the brain a well-known attraction for alcohol,' and of that strange
                  attraction I have myself been the victim."</p>
               <p>"Is it not, then," asked Charlotte, "a fearful crime to lay one's self open to the
                  influence of that attraction, to stimulate it by indulgence gence, to develop it
                  when it is inactive, and likely for ever to remain so?"</p>
               <p>"A great sin," said Geoffrey frankly, even bitterly—"a great, a fatal crime; and
                  just as great a sin for the sale of this dangerous drink to be licensed, for its
                  manufacture to be permitted. Every distillery, every liquor warehouse, every
                  wholesale or retail place of traffic is a place under the direct patronage of the
                  devil himself, and will provoke inevitably in some fearful shape the Divine fury.
                  I feel all this, Charley. I look back with pain and bitter longing to those days
                  when I was free and unscathed; when, in the name of good-fellowship, simply to be
                  jolly and not to seem above my friends, cautious and calculating, I tempted my
                  destruction. 'The Best Fellow in the World,' you know they called me that,
                  Charley, and I have robbed the world of what I might have been in learning and
                  philanthropy. I know I grieved—her, Charley; I have been your greatest grief. I
                  have disappointed yonder two gray heads who set their hope upon me. The world's
                  Best Fellow has made it no<pb n="302-303" xml:id="VAC8381-00000152"/> better, and
                  the King of Good Fellows is only a slave!"</p>
               <p>"For this disease, there is, I believe, a remedy," said Charlotte.</p>
               <p>"When you talk of the remedy, Charley, there's the rub. Some say the trouble is
                  entirely in the morals, and they recommend you a <emph>pledge.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"A pledge is exceedingly good—in its place," said Charlotte. "I would say it is
                  better late than never; but the true time for the pledge is
                     early—<emph>early;</emph> at the beginning; before that fatal attraction, which
                  we spoke of, has been tempted to show its power. The pledge belongs to the
                  preventives, and I recommend it <emph>to be taken in time.</emph>"</p>
               <p>"And another party, my dear Charley, proclaim the disease of drunkenness entirely
                  physical, and they attack it with material remedies. In some place in
                  Europe—where, has escaped my mind—on the principle that <foreign xml:lang="LAT"
                     >similia similibus curantur,</foreign> they assail the disease with brandy, and
                  they give the patient brandy in everything—he sees it, tastes it, smells it, until
                  he utterly abhors alcohol for ever, and sometimes he dies in the process of
                  learning to hate it."</p>
               <p>"The fact is," said Charlotte, "that the disease of drunkenness is a disease at
                  the same time of the physical and the mental nature. In its very beginning, it
                  preys upon and weakens the will. I recommend denunciations, imprisonment, fines,
                  hard labor; but I recommend them <emph>not</emph> for the <emph>drunkard,</emph>
                  but for the <emph>maker</emph> and <emph>seller</emph> of drink. For him who has
                  fallen a victim to this morbid appetite, and is so much diseased that he does not
                  know his danger, does not want to get well, the law should interfere, should treat
                  him as a monomaniac, should provide a suitable asylum or hospital, call it which
                  you will, promptly put him into it, and see to it that there he has suitable
                  remedies—exercise and medication to heal the physical injury, instruction and
                  abstinence from the fatal stimulant to remedy the mental disorder. Still more, my
                  Geoffrey, there is but One who sits higher than the human will; he only, who is
                  God and King over all, can right that will when it has gone astray, can<pb
                     n="304-305" xml:id="VAC8381-00000153"/> strengthen it when it has grown weak,
                  can purify it when it has become vile. So, as inebriation is a disease that
                  primarily attacks the will, to the Great Physician the inebriate must turn for the
                  first part of his cure."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey sat up again on the green bank. He had thrown aside his hat, and the
                  sunshine fell through the leafy boughs above him, and, lying on his flowing hair,
                  touched it with something of the lustre and sheen of youth. He turned upon his
                  sister eyes from which the laughter-light had faded.</p>
               <p>"O Charley," he said, and the voice that had rung with merry music, and been rich
                  and eloquent and so persuasive, was only a mournful echo now—"Charley! how happy
                  is that young man who stands master of himself, his youth the sovereign and not
                  the serf of his appetites; who is honest and upright as God made him to be; who
                  hears the voice of God speaking in his soul and demanding his allegiance; who
                  listens to that voice; who becomes the worshipper of Christ, and so is made for
                  ever safe! To him a bondage to vice shall never come, wreck and disaster shall not
                  end the voyage of his life. He shall not reach a time when his heart, having
                  perhaps a soft side for his friends and humanity for men, is hard as adamant
                  toward heaven. He shall never find an hour when all his expectations are limited
                  to this present world; when death brings neither hope nor dread; when the thought
                  of salvation is only as a far-away remembrance of a child's dream of daisies in
                  the spring."</p>
               <p>Appalled, Charlotte turned away her face; tears were chilled in their fountain.
                  She could find no words to answer.</p>
               <p>Presently Geoffrey continued:</p>
               <p>"To such a young man I would say: If you would make life worth living, and find it
                  only the stepping-stone to a higher and better being; if you value your happiness,
                  your coming usefulness, the peace of your friends, don't let this good occasion
                  slip; be <emph>man</emph> enough to be a <emph>Christian:</emph> if you can't be
                  one from feeling, be one from principle; if you cannot be a Christian by being
                  very penitent, and very sorrowful, and very<pb n="306-307"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000154"/> happy, go over to God's side, because you ought to
                  be there."</p>
               <p>"You think, then," said Charlotte, turning full upon her brother, "that you would
                  be advising this young man to do what would be undeniably best for himself?"</p>
               <p>"Undoubtedly. Experience teaches me that. I speak from reason, but not from
                  feeling."</p>
               <p>"And this demand from God upon the young man's love and service, is that a just
                  demand, a lawful claim?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," said Geoffrey, with a coolness that bordered on indifference; "you know,
                  Charley, that I have never cavilled at any of the assertions of Scripture."</p>
               <p>"Then pray tell me," said Charlotte briskly, following up her advantage, "does
                  your having withheld from God the whole of your life thus far, which is by your
                  own showing his due, give you any right to deny him what remains? Does your
                  keeping back part of the debt release you from obligation concerning the
                  remainder? Having defrauded God of his property right in some thirty-eight years
                  of Geoffrey Hunter's life, are you not adding sin to sin by refusing him the
                  twenty or thirty years that may yet remain to you?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! but, Charley, I do not <emph>feel</emph> this."</p>
               <p>"That is nothing; you recognize the <emph>justice</emph> of the case. Were you not
                  saying to the supposititious young man, 'If you are not a Christian from feeling,
                  be one from principle'? Apply to yourself the arguments used to your young man.
                  God's law and demand is ever the same: it does not change to suit individuals. If
                  he ever had a claim on any one, he has on you, Geoffrey Hunter, and you should be
                  honorable enough to admit it."</p>
               <p>Charlotte rose and turned away, leaving Geoffrey seated on the grass by the Happy
                  River. She wished to give him time to think of the weighty subject of their
                  conversation. Just where the road turned, she met her father. Nearly eighty
                  winters had whitened the old man's hair, but he was hale and active still, and,
                  now that Geoffrey had come home, the father was more than ordinarily<pb
                     n="308-309" xml:id="VAC8381-00000155"/> dinarily cheerful, being filled with
                  some secret joy.</p>
               <p>"You are taking a long walk, father," said Charlotte, as he turned to go with her
                  toward the house.</p>
               <p>"I saw you two sitting yonder," said the old man, "and it carried me back to other
                  years, when you used to go there for all your plans and studies. It almost seemed
                  as if you were children again."</p>
               <p>"If it were not for Oliver," said Charlotte with sadness, "I should wish we were
                  back at childhood, to live our lives over again, and perhaps do it better."</p>
               <p>"Do not be despondent about your brother, my daughter," said the old man.</p>
               <p>They had passed along the lane, and Mr. Hunter stepped up the low embankment, to
                  stand by the fence and watch the swift progress of the mowing-machine around the
                  field.</p>
               <p>"The day is getting hot, father," said Charlotte; "perhaps you had better not stay
                  out here in the sun."</p>
               <p>"This tree makes shade enough, child; come under it." And the old man glanced up
                  into the green boughs of the maple that waved above his head. "What was I saying
                  to you about your brother, Charlotte?" he asked, leaning against the fence to
                  rest. "Not to despond, was it? Well, I have a strong hope about him. I've never
                  said much, not so much as I ought, perhaps; but I have prayed, and of late prayed
                  a great deal, and I believe I have been heard. It somehow came into my mind that,
                  if our Geoffrey got home to us this time, I would take it as a sign that so he
                  would be helped to return to his Heavenly Father. I never told any one, not even
                  your mother, that the night before Geoffrey came home I was very wakeful, and I
                  prayed much of the time that he might return to me, and at the same time prayed
                  that he might forsake the error of his ways and be a converted man. The Lord has
                  answered one part of my petition, Charlotte, and I don't think I ought to doubt
                  that he will answer the other."</p>
               <p>Charlotte had never heard her father speak so freely of his own feelings or
                     hopes.<pb n="310-311" xml:id="VAC8381-00000156"/> His words encouraged her. She
                  was just about to relate the conversation by the river, when her brother-in-law
                  drove by on the mower, and cried out:</p>
               <p>"You had better go up to the house, father; it is too warm for you here."</p>
               <p>"Ay, ay!" replied the old gentleman cheerfully, "that is the way grandfathers get
                  ordered about."</p>
               <p>Charlotte was just reaching out her hand to steady him down the short declivity,
                  when a stone rolled from beneath his foot, and he fell heavily backward, striking
                  his head violently against the fence. At first Charlotte thought that he was dead,
                  and her wild cry reached Geoffrey musing by the stream, and the men busy in the
                  field, but the aged father's work was not yet done, and he returned to
                  consciousness when they had carried him into the house.</p>
               <p>All the physician as well as the son awoke in Geoffrey on beholding his father's
                  pitiful state. He knew well that there was no practitioner in the neighborhood as
                  skilful as himself, and his mother and sisters desired him to take the case
                  entirely into his own hands. Geoffrey insisted upon having the most reliable
                  doctors of the county called, but they on coming could only approve what he had
                  done, and admit that the old gentleman was in a dangerous situation.</p>
               <p>"Such a shock to the system at his great age is almost sure to prove fatal," said
                  one, as they stood in consultation on the steps of the piazza.</p>
               <p>"I wonder that he retains his consciousness," said another. "As his strength
                  begins to yield, I should recommend some stimulant to keep him up."</p>
               <p>"Sorry we cannot give you encouragement, doctor," said a third to Geoffrey. "The
                  good man is universally beloved, but you see the case clearly for yourself. He
                     <emph>may</emph> be kept up for a time, days or weeks."</p>
               <p>They soon mounted their horses and drove away.</p>
               <p>The little children were huddled, awestruck, under a tree at a short distance from
                  the house. Eva's husband nervously paced<pb n="312-313" xml:id="VAC8381-00000157"
                  /> the garden-walks; Eva in the dining-room was by the lounge where Geoffrey had
                  authoritatively placed his mother, whom this sudden sorrow had completely
                  overcome.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey watched his brother-physicians drive away, and then returned to his
                  father, by whom Charlotte was watching. The old man looked up.</p>
               <p>"This injury is fatal, my son; I know that."</p>
               <p>Geoffrey dared not deny; he could not assent.</p>
               <p>"What day of the month is it, daughter?"</p>
               <p>Charlotte told him.</p>
               <p>"Next Monday week I shall be eighty years old," said father Hunter, after some
                  consideration. "I am ready to die. I have lived long enough—if only—if only—" He
                  closed his eyes wearily.</p>
               <p>"Are you faint, father?" asked Charlotte.</p>
               <p>"Somewhat, child."</p>
               <p>"Charley," said Geoffrey hastily, "is there any wine or brandy in the house? The
                  doctors agreed that he had better have some stimulant in case of faintness, and I
                  am of their opinion. You will see that some is procured at once. How will you take
                  it, father?"</p>
               <p>"I will take nothing of the kind," replied the old man, rousing himself. "I don't
                  think it would be wrong, but simply useless; the strength brandy would give me
                  would be transient, and when it left me I should be weaker than ever. I am better
                  now. I shall surely die of this, but not to-day, my children; and I am ready to
                  die, if—"</p>
               <p>"Have you anything weighing on your mind, father?" asked Geoffrey, bending over
                  the bed.</p>
               <p>"Yes, son; I have something I must say to you, but not just now. I shall not die
                  with it unsaid. You will watch with me tonight, son; none but you."</p>
               <p>It was a watch that Geoffrey would have yielded to none; his whole care was for
                  his father. His brother-in-law remained in an adjacent room, to be called in case
                  of need; but Geoffrey was close beside his parent. About midnight the invalid
                  reached from his bed, and clasped his son's hand.</p>
               <pb n="314-315" xml:id="VAC8381-00000158"/>
               <p>"One thing only prevents my dying in peace."</p>
               <p>"And what is that, father?" But Geoffrey guessed the answer even as he asked. His
                  eyes fell beneath his father's gaze.</p>
               <p>"Anxiety for you, my son. My poor boy, I fear the fault is mine that you have gone
                  astray. Do not let me die feeling that through my deficiencies your life has been
                  destroyed."</p>
               <p>"You have been the best of fathers," sobbed Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"And you have been the most affectionate and winning of sons; and yet, my lad,
                  very far from what you should be; and your soul is in great danger. Geoffrey, I do
                  not ask you to promise to keep from drinking. You cannot do that in your own
                  strength; but I do beseech of you to seek the Lord, that happily he may be found
                  of you."</p>
               <p>"I do not know where nor how to begin, father. Once it seemed easy."</p>
               <p>"It is easy now, son. Cast yourself on God's mercy; give yourself to him."</p>
               <p>"Father," said Geoffrey, "if I so give myself, if I so resolve, you know what will
                  follow; that mania, that unquenchable, unconquerable thirst, that insanity for
                  drink will come upon me; and what can I do? You know that I do not want to drink,
                  that I wish I never might feel that craving again; and you know—but no, you cannot
                  even guess—how, if by getting some supernatural help that shall resist the
                  appetite, the strife will be worse than being torn of wild beasts. O father! it is
                  so much easier to yield; it is so horrible to resist." He bowed his head by his
                  father's side, and the dying old man softly stroked his hair as when he was a
                  child.</p>
               <p>"The strife cannot last for ever, my boy; at each renewal of the struggle the
                  victory will be easier for you. You will be more than conqueror, my son, through
                  One who is mighty."</p>
               <p>"It is a fearful thing, father, to look forward to a life of wild conflict and
                  iron selfdenial. You, happy in having never fostered such an appetite as mine,
                  cannot at all apprehend the trial you propose to me."</p>
               <p>"It has been the great error of your life,<pb n="316-317"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000159"/> my boy, that you have chosen that which is easiest
                  and pleasantest rather than that which is right. When you lie where I am,
                  Geoffrey, it will be too late for choice, and you will see yourself the victim of
                  your own cowardice. You tell me I cannot realize your trial; I tell you, boy, that
                  you cannot realize the solemnity of lying at death's very door, nor the horror of
                  knowing that that door will swing back only to blackness and despair."</p>
               <p>Still Geoffrey remained silent, his head bowed close to his dying father's side.
                  His doom delayed, perchance by his father's and sister's prayers; good angels may
                  have come and stood on either side to strengthen him.</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey!" it was the faltering voice that should soon be hushed for ever.</p>
               <p>"Father—I cannot."</p>
               <p>"Son, you <emph>must.</emph>"</p>
               <p>Geoffrey raised himself and looked steadily into his father's face. The old man's
                  eye grew bright, his voice was strong.</p>
               <p>"Son, I tell you, you must. You dare not deny my last request—disobey my last
                  command mand. I <emph>will not</emph> go out of this life with your soul's blood
                  on my garments. Decide now for heaven. Promise me that you will now heartily and
                  entirely follow your known duty, and give your soul to Christ. You are not
                  ignorant of these things, my son. You have battled against the convictions of your
                  conscience all these years. I have prayed for you so much of late that I am sure
                  your heart has been stirred. Geoffrey, will you serve God?"</p>
               <p>Those eager eyes held him as by a magic spell. Geoffrey felt as if the last hour
                  of his opportunity had come. Now he was to choose for eternity: here, the battle,
                  the victory over self, the peace at last which passeth knowledge; there, the
                  infamous yielding, the floating with a current that would carry him to everlasting
                  loss. Help came from on high.</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey!" The old man had had power like Israel, and had prevailed.</p>
               <p>"Father—I will."</p>
               <p>Late, but not too late, the hour of redemption had drawn nigh—late, for before
                  this man, saved as by fire, his soul garments<pb n="318-319"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000160"/> spotted by the evils of the flesh, lay, the
                  remainder of his life, a bitter way.</p>
               <p>The old man spent his eightieth birthday on earth. As the sun was setting, and he
                  lay supported by pillows that he might the easier draw his few remaining breaths,
                  his family came around him. Eva's youngest, a white-robed baby, lay on the foot of
                  the bed asleep. Geoffrey's golden-haired child had climbed up to rest her bright
                  head on the grandfather's pillow.</p>
               <p>"Geoffrey!" spoke the dying parent, "if any man draw back, my soul shall have no
                  pleasure in him."</p>
               <p>"By God's help," Geoffrey made answer, "I will never draw back."</p>
               <p>Then, being satisfied, the old man fell asleep, his slumber so profound that only
                  an angel proclaiming the coming of the Lord could waken him.</p>

            <div type="chapter">
               <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
               <p>THE old man, whose last work was, perhaps, his best work, had been buried. About
                  his grave a concourse of friends had come, and had mourned for him as once a
                  Father was wept by a people at Abel-Mizraim. The autumn leaves now were drifted
                  over that narrow mound, and Charlotte's stay at the farm was ended, and, with the
                  little child, she was going home.</p>
               <p>"I wish I were going with you, Charley," said Geoffrey, as he and his twin sister
                  walked slowly along the lane on the last evening of her stay. "You have a magic to
                  charm away the demon that sometimes takes possession of me. I fly to you to pity,
                  to understand, to help me conquer, to rejoice when the battle is ended, and
                  success has been nearly as physically fatal as defeat. I wish I were going; and
                  yet I cannot leave mother, she is so determined to have me<pb n="320-321"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000161"/> stay, and she needs my care as a physician.
                  Mother's days are numbered, but I can do something for her still. You leave me
                  beleagured, and sometimes taken possession of, by a legion of devils."</p>
               <p>"And you know, Geof, that there is One who can cast out devils, and before whom
                  they tremble."</p>
               <p>"There is the right word in the right place. It is not every one, my Charley, who
                  knows how to deal out golden apples."</p>
               <p>"I am sorry to leave you, Geof, but not apprehensive; for I feel greater is He
                  that is with you than he that is against you."</p>
               <p>"Well, Charley, my aim has always been to take life easily, and have as jolly a
                  time as I could. Now the strife has begun in dead earnest, and it is pretty hard
                  on me. When you are gone, I shall have to chronicle for you my—"</p>
               <p>"<emph>Victories,</emph>" said Charlotte. "You will not suffer a defeat."</p>
               <p>"Each encounter will be like nothing but Christian's big fight in the valley of
                  Humiliation," said Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"Well, he won, and was a better man ever after," replied Charlotte.</p>
               <p>She went home. She did not know when she had been so happy. All the world looked
                  glad and young, and the winter seemed more beautiful than summers past.</p>
               <p>Letters came from Geoffrey—letters that made her smile and sigh:</p>
               <p>"Was ever a man so tempted as I have been, Charley? I am reaping a whirlwind of my
                  own sowing, and have the consolation of feeling sure this is only the small
                  beginning of it. What might I not have been now but for that thrice-accursed
                  drink! If ever a man cast about 'firebrands, arrows, and death,' the liquor-dealer
                  does. Are you interested to hear of the last fight? It has left me a poor wreck,
                  hardly able to drive a pen. It began in the old way. I felt horribly, mind and
                  body in a turmoil, and one feeling slowly rose and took complete possession and
                  absorbed every desire. I must have some brandy, I must have brandy, or I should
                  die; and that grim resolution came out of somewhere, a resolution that I never<pb
                     n="322-323" xml:id="VAC8381-00000162"/>
                  <emph>used</emph> to feel. I <emph>wouldn't</emph> have the brandy if I did
                     <emph>die</emph> for lack of it. I looked wretchedly, of course, and mother and
                  Eva <emph>nagged</emph> without meaning to, asking questions and advising. Matters
                  got worse. I should soon be at the hotel <foreign xml:lang="LAT">nolens
                     volens.</foreign> I fled up-stairs, locked myself in my room, and to make sure
                  flung the key out of the window. Then suddenly all the world grew so black, and
                  all beyond the world so dubious, that I made haste and flung my razor and all the
                     <emph>hanging</emph> things I could find out of the window also, and they went
                  into that clump of lilac bushes. Then I tore about awhile, and discovered in the
                  small closet any amount of bottles of nostrums of Eva's, and, not knowing what
                  mischief lay in them, I locked the door, and out the window went that key. There
                  was nothing left now but for me to act the madman at my leisure, and I practised
                  that rôle until dinner-time, when Eva came judiciously to call me, and I roared
                  out to be let alone. So I was let alone, only she and mother came to the door to
                  listen several times, for I heard them. Tea-time, and I refused to come out, and
                  couldn't eat; bed-time, and along comes that outrageously foolish, reckless Eva,
                  and, crying outside the door, was afraid I'd be sick and die, and, if I <figure/>
                  wanted some wine, I'd better take it, she knew where to get me some. O Charley! if
                  that door hadn't been keyless, and I had not been taking that old Bible of yours
                  as a<pb n="324-325" xml:id="VAC8381-00000163"/> weapon of defence against the
                  adversary, I should then have been ruined assuredly. Did not that girl know that
                  death was better than yielding? However, she meant well; all the trouble with Eva
                  is that she never had any head. You, being greedy, my Charley, pre-empted all the
                  head there was for the family. When morning came, the foes were whipped out for
                  the time being, and mine was but a poor triumph, for I was about destroyed myself.
                  When mother's dear old voice piped through the door, I very meekly asked for
                  coffee, and Eva, coming up with it, was to her amazement sent out to hunt the key
                  in the grass, and there she found the other things; and such a hub-bub! I think
                  mother understood it, though; for up came the dear soul presently, and looked at
                  me through every variation of eyes and spectacles; indeed, I didn't know there
                  could be so many changes wrought with those three articles; then down-stairs she
                  went singing Old Hundred. That evening I told her that she must see to it that Eva
                  put every drop of wine or alcohol out of the house, and never make such a
                  dangerous offer again. Poor Eva! she cried all next day. All is quiet with me now,
                  Charley; I can't tell how long it will be so. Sometimes I fear the end will be an
                  attack of epilepsy, but <emph>that</emph> would be better than to die a drunkard.
                  I can but die anyhow, and I trust I shall hold fast my integrity. I feel
                  frequently like those lepers who sat outside of Samaria. At the worst, they could
                  but die, and they saw a chance of something better. You are right, my Charley;
                  only Divine help can pull a man through such difficulties as mine."</p>
               <p>This was not the only time when Geoffrey in despair locked himself up and threw
                  his key away. Again and again, as that winter passed, its fiercest storms were
                  trifles to the wild contest between appetite and resolution in Geoffrey's breast.
                  Never did knight of the olden time wage such furious strife with dragons as
                  Geoffrey fought with the desire he had nourished within himself. This jolly King
                  of Good Fellows had lost now his roystering followers and his convivial royalty<pb
                     n="326-327" xml:id="VAC8381-00000164"/> alty, and had become Christ's common
                  soldier, sharply doing battle with the indwelling sin.</p>
               <p>We are never tempted above that we are able to bear. With each temptation the way
                  of escape is opened, narrow and thorny perhaps, but a way nevertheless, and
                  Geoffrey, as each time he overcame, grew more a man, and pressed nearer the crown
                  of life, the white raiment, and the Morning Star.</p>
               <p>Few Good Fellows see such a year as this which Geoffrey lived through. Better for
                  them if they did perhaps. For now, at last, was Geoffrey becoming worthy of his
                  great gifts. His mind was growing clearer, his ambition was ennobled; the mental
                  conflict died away. Geoffrey went back to his books and his studies, and a hope
                  grew up in his heart that he should make his last days his best days, and do
                  something at last for the world which is sorely in need of the work of truly Good
                  Fellows.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey's filial labors and duties were ended. Mother Hunter's spectacles were
                  locked away; she should see no more through a glass darkly. She was laid down
                  beside the companion of fifty years of her pilgrimage, and, when her eyes again
                  opened, they should be able to bear the light of an eternal day.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey went to Oliver and Charlotte. He thought to study and work in quiet, but
                  the retirement did not last long. He was called out to active life.</p>
               <p>As Charlotte had said, Geoffrey's errors and falls were known to very few, his
                  shining talents to many. He had been known as the foremost student, the successful
                  lawyer, the skilful physician. If rumors to his discredit had begun to breathe
                  when he left his first profession, they were quickly changed to praises when he at
                  once began to study with Doctor Gray, made a happy marriage, and was soon well
                  established in a good practice. Over Geoffrey's short-comings, genius and fortune
                  had thrown a veil; his generous, cheerful disposition had won him friends and
                  closed the lips of reproach. Articles contributed by Geoffrey to various medical
                  and scientific journals had<pb n="328-329" xml:id="VAC8381-00000165"/> been
                  received with great favor. His brother-physicians and the faculty of his Alma
                  Mater had ever held him in high esteem, and when shortly after his mother's death
                  he went with Oliver and Charlotte to Europe, and spent a year in study and in
                  writing, on his return home he found himself elected to a professorship in a
                  medical college connected with the university where he had graduated.</p>
               <p>"There is now," said the gratified Geoffrey, "an opportunity for me to return to
                  the world the kindness which it has ever shown me, to make my mark on time, and
                  leave a generation better and wiser for my having labored for it."</p>
               <p>In changing his character at this late day, Geoffrey had not lost his old-time
                  appellation of the Best Fellow in the World.</p>
               <p>Once he had claimed this distinction in virtue of wild jollity, exuberant wit,
                  reckless expenditure, and unlimited ability to amuse and be amused. Now his
                  students unanimously reconferred the title upon a man who gave hearty sympathy to
                  those who sorrowed and those who rejoiced; who considered others' happiness before
                  his own; who thoroughly appreciated merit wherever found, and, never forgetting
                  that he was a gentleman, by his courtesy lifted all his associates for the time
                  being to his own rank.</p>
               <p>Geoffrey was pleasantly said to have a hobby, and that hobby was supposed to be
                  temperance. It is a steed by many as thoroughly despised as the famous gingerbread
                  and hay Bucephalus of Mother Goose's melodies. Nevertheless, on this same hobby
                  our Geoffrey had escaped from the very jaws of destruction, and he valued the
                  charger accordingly.</p>
               <p>"Physicians," said Geoffrey to his young gentlemen, "should be a band of apostles
                  for temperance; on the contrary, they are too frequently the advocates of
                  alcoholic drinks; and I believe a great deal of drunkenness may be traced to their
                  prescriptions."</p>
               <p>"You are teaching straight against many of our books, and some of our other
                  professors, doctor," suggested one.</p>
               <pb n="330-331" xml:id="VAC8381-00000166"/>
               <p>"My dear fellow, I am teaching right against my former practice," replied
                  Geoffrey. "I know whereof I affirm, for I have tried it. Here I stand, wrecked by
                  false views and false practice on this very point."</p>
               <p>"We are none of us likely to stand in awe of making such a goodly wreck ourselves.
                  There's not one in ten of us will ever be able to attain your position," said a
                  jolly boy, who much admired Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>"I fear, my friend," said Geoffrey, turning to him, "that, if you know me as long
                  as I shall know myself, you will see the wreck made evident."</p>
               <p>From his experiments as a chemist, from his practice as a physician, did Geoffrey
                  bring his proofs against the use of distilled and fermented drinks. From humanity
                  and religion he gathered his reasons.</p>
               <p>"It is very convincing, professor," said a student, "I cannot find any flaw in
                  your argument; but, if these things are so, why have they not been recognized
                  these many years?"</p>
               <p>"The false," said Geoffrey, "is generally promulgated before the true, and there
                  is nothing more tenacious of existence than a popular error. These truths have
                  been proclaimed, however, for years and years. In that old-fashioned book which,
                  doubtless, your mother values more than you do, and which you must come to value
                  if you are ever going to be worthy of your creation, precept and example have been
                  given on this point. Says the wisest man: 'It is not for kings to drink wine;' to
                  judges and magistrates he says, 'Lest they drink and pervert judgment;' to the
                  minister it is forbidden, 'Neither shall any priest drink wine when they enter
                  into the inner court;' the provident is warned to abstain from drink, or he will
                  not be rich; the strong man is forbidden, lest he come to 'woe;' the happy is told
                  that drink will bring him to poverty and sorrow; and the Christian is exhorted to
                  'avoid drunkenness,' and to see to it that he does not partake of a drink that
                  shall make his brother to stumble. It takes a long time to bring people up to
                  viewing sins and follies from a Bible standpoint."</p>
               <pb n="332-333" xml:id="VAC8381-00000167"/>
               <p>"The tipplers have a righteous Noah for an example."</p>
               <p>"The world makes great capital out of a good man's sin," replied Geoffrey. "Noah
                  erred; the eyes of a world have been turned upon him, and men have taken for an
                  example, or an excuse, that which was meant for warning. We have Daniel, Samson,
                  John the Baptist, and the deathless succession of the Rechabites, for an example
                  of total abstainers."</p>
               <p>The young man smiled. "You have a magnetism that always carries your point. I have
                  heard say that, when you were in the law, it was next to impossible for a jury to
                  decide against your client. The truth is, professor, there is spreading here a
                  strong temperance feeling; the students are taking a position quite different from
                  that they formerly held on this subject."</p>
               <p>"Thank God!" said Geoffrey in his heart. "I should like at least to turn as many
                  to good as I have formerly led to evil."</p>
               <p>"Glad you came here," said a venerable man, under whose eye Geoffrey had pursued
                  his collegiate course. "I always thought you were born to be a blessing to the
                  world."</p>
               <p>Then Geoffrey's heart rose up to condemn him, and pointed to sins of omission and
                  commission. Alas! for those things left undone that we ought to have done. All
                  Geoffrey's life should have been spent in some worthy work, and over these many
                  years could be written the epitaph, "Worse than wasted."</p>
               <p>It is a bitter thing to devote one's self, in all the golden hours of youth, to
                  heaping up retribution, to have a memory that should brood in peace over the past,
                  like a dove on its nest changed to a serpent that hides in the bosom but to
                  sting!</p>
               <p>There were many of the young men who now surrounded Geoffrey who were the
                  advocates of alcoholic stimulants, prejudiced in their favor by early training, by
                  their own appetite, or by false instructions from an overhasty class of writers
                  and teachers whose theory chimes rather with their own desires than with
                  facts.</p>
               <p>"What the system wants is fuel, doctor,"<pb n="334-335" xml:id="VAC8381-00000168"
                  /> said a student of the last year's lectures, lounging in Geoffrey's
                  lecture-room, "and alcohol belongs to the hydrocarbons."</p>
               <p>"Adduce a single proof," replied the professor, "that, taken into a living body,
                  alcohol unites with more oxygen, and becomes respiratory food."</p>
               <p>The young man, taken aback, vainly racked his brains for the needful item.</p>
               <p>"You cannot find it," said Geoffrey coolly. "There <emph>is</emph> no such proof
                  in all the range of scientific investigation."</p>
               <p>While the student still searched for a fact to make his position good, a friend
                  came to the rescue, to call off the teacher's attention by a new question.</p>
               <p>"Does not alcohol prevent the waste of the system?"</p>
               <p>"Consider if this waste is needful. If atomic change is part of nature's law, is
                  its prevention judicious? Is it not rather converting the human frame into a
                  storehouse of poison and disease? To check change is not to add nutrition. If
                  change is the only danger of humanity, if we stop that entirely, shall we live for
                  ever? Was De Leon's fountain supposed to be unlimited apple-jack, or the tree of
                  life a vegetable distillery? My friend, alcohol gets out of the system a few hours
                  after it is taken in; while in, it checks active change in the tissues. Will you
                  be the subject of our experiments, and agree to keep taking in alcohol as fast as
                  it is eliminated, to show us what the result of preventing atomic changes will
                  be?"</p>
               <p>The embryo doctor laughed and shook his head.</p>
               <p>"Don't play with poisons, my boy," said Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>Here a new-comer, a young man, who had read one medical book and a half and had
                  heard three lectures, therefore thinking he knew everything, struck in with the
                  often-repeated enquiry:</p>
               <p>"Why, if alcohol is innutritious and injurious, do many habitual drinkers grow fat
                  and hearty in appearance?"</p>
               <p>"Accumulation of fat is quite often physical degeneration. Your experience will
                  one day show you that the fattest people are not<pb n="336-337"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000169"/> always the healthiest or the longest-lived;
                  assuredly not, where the carbonaceous deposit is morbid and induced by the
                  presence of repeated doses of alcohol. If the accumulation of fat is in the heart,
                  for instance—" said the professor.</p>
               <p>"Or the <emph>brain,</emph> for instance," said a nagging youth, unkindly
                  regarding the new student.</p>
               <p>"It might prevent him from seeing the importance and wisdom of the professor's
                  observations," chimed in a second young man, and, in the laughter that succeeded,
                  the youth, who was so wise in his own conceit, slipped out—let us hope, to resume
                  his studies.</p>
               <p>But the reign of the royal professor over the admiring students was to be all too
                  brief. Within himself Geoffrey felt fatal premonitions of the coming doom—the doom
                  he had tempted in his rash career. Over the fair expanding of his middle age the
                  blight should come, incurred by the folly of his youth.</p>
               <p>"How indefatigably you work!" exclaimed a friend.</p>
               <p>"Because the night cometh," replied Geoffrey.</p>
               <p>Nerves worn out before their time, the sharp renewal at intervals of the wild
                  conflict between appetite and resolution, between soul and body, ushered in the
                  ruin. The use of alcohol, <emph>facts and statistics</emph> show us, diminishes
                  the capacity for mental labor even of the noblest brain. The intellect of Geoffrey
                  Hunter, which might have made itself felt over all the world—perhaps, who knows,
                  in all coming time—had been weakened by his long indulgence in intemperance, and
                  could not endure the strain which his ambition to do good, his tireless zeal in
                  some measure to retrieve the past, now put upon it.</p>
               <p>A few brief years, all too few and brief for the work of a lifetime which must be
                  compressed into them, passed. Thus long his immense physical and intellectual
                  strength sufficed him even after reckless abuse. Then ill news flew from lip to
                  lip.</p>
               <p>"An irreparable loss!"</p>
               <p>"Could have spared almost any other man better."</p>
               <pb n="338-339" xml:id="VAC8381-00000170"/>
               <p>"Strange. He looked when a boy as if born to live a hundred years."</p>
               <p>"Ah! that's often the way. Your strong men break down all at once. We shall not
                  soon again find a Doctor Hunter."</p>
               <p>Paralysis had seized our Best Fellow—Geoffrey the strong and the generous. The
                  physical retribution had come. And what was Geoffrey now? A living soul, verily
                  imprisoned in a body of death; a sentient brain, whose command could not now lift
                  a finger nor move a foot. He lived, breathed, thought, spoke, and lay bound as in
                  fetters of iron.</p>
               <p>Now, when others cried "How strange!" "How mysterious!" "What a singular
                  Providence!" did Geoffrey echo the words?</p>
               <p>Not he. He knew too well the laws of being to think it strange that their
                  transgression should bring a physical punishment. It was no mystery to him that
                  the poisons which he had so freely used had induced disease. He did not think that
                  Providence singular which prostrated him in the midst of his usefulness and in the
                  happiness of his reform. We live under a spiritual remedial dispensation; but
                  God's mercy has set disease to dog the steps of excess. Those who sin against the
                  laws of their physical being must not expect to escape the retribution of
                  suffering and premature death. And this chastisement which appeals to all, even to
                  those hardened beings over whom moral and spiritual motives have no power, limits
                  crime, which without being thus circumscribed would prevail and fill the earth
                  with violence.</p>
               <p>Let every Good Fellow, let every jolly lad who aspires to fill Geoffrey's recent
                  place, and be the undeniably Best Fellow and the Royal Good Fellow taking
                  precedence of all, come look upon our Geoffrey now. Hector Gray, starting with
                  less muscle and less brain than this our prodigally endowed hero, is hearty,
                  honored, and happy, and in revered old age shall see his grandchildren gathered
                  about his knees; but Royal Geoffrey lies here helpless in his prime, and through a
                  long nightmare in which no agony of effort, no wild longing for release,<pb
                     n="340-341" xml:id="VAC8381-00000171"/> shall restore him liberty of motion, he
                  drifts down to death, which comes at once too early and too late.</p>
               <p>Fred Gay, who in all the early school-years was to the giant Geoffrey as a child,
                  rescued by a pledge given not too late, has prospered in his business, attained
                  large fortune, and scattered his benefactions in such golden stream that orphans
                  have blessed him, joy has beamed on sorrowful hearts, the hopeless have taken
                  courage, and Fred Gay is even richer in the prayers of the poor and the love of
                  grateful friends than in dollars and cents, mortgages, and United States
                  bonds.</p>
               <p>Tony Moreland and his Judy shall see many days and children's children.</p>
               <p>Eva's boys and girls are mocking the glad laughter of the Happy River as it flows
                  along; but who of you gay fellows, with life before you and so many splendid
                  possibilities locked in your coming manhood, will elect Geoffrey Hunter's course,
                  and take his doom?</p>
               <p>Is none of you willing to try this death in life? Will none of you resign the
                  strength of his middle age? Does no one court the bondage of paralysis? Is there
                  no claimant for the long train of ills that may come instead? Beware, then, of
                  flip and sling, of julep and spiced wine; of brandy, whiskey, roystering
                  apple-jack, and seductive Tom-and-Jerry. See the danger that lurks in old Jamaica
                  and best Bourbon; avoid the late wine-supper, the port and sherry for an
                  after-dinner flourish, the champagne at the party, and the carouse that begins as
                  it grows toward midnight and royally keeps up until daybreak. Take heed that you
                  are not beguiled by rollicking festive songs, by sparkling glasses, neat cases of
                  bottles, and costly decanters. When you go out to make calls on New Year's, stick
                  to your coffee, and refuse the wine, no matter how fair the siren that proffers
                  it; be hero enough to say that you <emph>never drink;</emph> be man enough to avow
                  that you are an abstainer; be not ashamed to hold that the better part of valor is
                  discretion and to fear the least beginnings of evil. Then you shall<pb n="342-343"
                     xml:id="VAC8381-00000172"/> all be truly good fellows, and that one of you who
                  has Geoffrey Hunter's genius, who has his royal generosity, and buoyant good
                  nature, and vigorous constitution—and who but hopes he can claim all these?—shall
                  be the Best Fellow in the World, and stand at eighty years a king still among men,
                  the glory of a generation that has passed, the model and admiration of a
                  generation to come.</p>
               <p>Here lies Geoffrey Hunter in his room at Charlotte's. Some one has carefully
                  bolstered up his head on a pair of laced pillows, and folded his useless hands
                  over the counter-pane. Over him the crimson silk canopy is caught up by a golden
                  hand, opposite him a fire glows in the grate, mocking the brightness of the
                  flowers in rug and carpet. Those costly ornaments on the marble mantle Geoffrey
                  brought from the Old World. It is Zell's beautiful face that looks down in smiling
                  muse from the frame above them. Those books in the case are what Charlotte reads
                  to her brother daily, though she sometimes thinks the amount which he is able to
                  hear and remember grows slowly less, and that chains of thought, once clearly
                  linked, are broken and distorted now to the sick man's brain. He likes music
                  sometimes, and there against the wall leans his little daughter's harp. She looks
                  like her mother, and, now that the hour of meeting that dear one is so much nearer
                  than the hour of parting, he has courage to call the child by her right name.</p>
               <p>The sunshine comes brightly in at the bay-window that has been turned to a bower
                  of green vines, which grasp in their frail hands the gossamer web of the curtains
                  and so climb upward. There are painted jars on the centre table, holding hyacinths
                  all abloom which fill the air with fragrance. Love has been busy here to make his
                  house a bower of beauty, but far be the thought that luxury of furnishing, the
                  sweetness of music or of flowers can compensate for the loss of that vigor that
                  would carry him out into the busy haunts of men, that would with springing step
                  pass over the long miles of frosty road, find pleasure in the steep declivity to
                     be<pb n="344-345" xml:id="VAC8381-00000173"/> climbed, and rejoice in stray
                  encounters with the wind and rain. But there is no complaining from this man who
                  lies here shorn of his strength. Geoffrey, the gay Sybarite of other years, is the
                  hero of quiet endurance now. When all other weapons have been wrested from him in
                  the battle of life, or by him early in the combat thrown away with reckless pride,
                  patience is left him even to the end. He is never alone. It would be as useless
                  for him to try to pull the bell-cord as to perform the labors of Hercules. His
                  servant sits near, but Geoffrey pays no heed to him. Before his open eyes glides
                  swiftly the long panorama of what might have been. Ah! shining heights of fame,
                  where now his feet might tread! O long succession of good deeds done, of
                  discoveries made, of important work accomplished, of loving hearts gladdened, of
                  heavenly charities scattered abroad, of the poor enriched, the weak strengthened,
                  the sick healed—that might have been. O reverend age endowed with love and honor;
                  the ripe fulness of years that added blessings; of eight good decades each better
                  than the last; O hoary hair such as crowned his father!—all this that might have
                  been. O blessing of the Lord that addeth true content, good example shed abroad,
                  peace of conscience, joy of heart—that might have been. All this might have been
                  but for the fatal cup for which he bartered his birthright. Now, though his
                  repenting soul has been plucked as a brand from the burning, his wrecked body is
                  an Esau finding no place for repentance, though he seeks it carefully and with
                  tears.</p>
               <p>Moon after moon waxes and wanes as he lies there. The tenacious life finds it so
                  hard to flicker, and waver, and die out before its time. Slowly glide the days,
                  each of which he eagerly searches for a death that does not come. He waits in
                  patience, and the end arrives at last. The Best Fellow in the World is dead. Let
                  somebody elect his successor.</p>
               <p>They carry him away, and lay him, as he ordered years ago, in that sacred spot
                  where Zell was buried. And now, is the fell curse ended? Has the ban of the
                  drunkard lost<pb n="346-347" xml:id="VAC8381-00000174"/> its power at last? Not
                  so; for even out of Geoffrey's grave the sin of his life reaches for his child.
                  The father's grapes have set the daughter's teeth on edge. Yet a few swift years,
                  and Charlotte, often bereaved, shall be robbed of the child of her affection.
                  Geoffrey's sin must deal yet another blow to the sister whose faithful love was
                  the choice blessing of his life. Not for himself alone does the drunkard
                  transgress. Vitiating his own system, he poisons the current of his children's
                  blood.</p>
               <p>Sing, Happy River, under winter ice or through the summer green, still blithely
                  running on the destined way. No human weakness nor woe disturbs the swift, bright
                  current of the stream. The feet that walked beside it tarry on the way and are for
                  ever quiet. Hushed are the voices that chimed with the ripple of the waters. New
                  birds build nests when the old-time warblers come no more up from the South.
                  Youngsters spring up where the old have fallen. With other summers, other blossoms
                  come. Swell up, O spring! in the basin of living rock, though the lips that once
                  drank here are crumbled to ashes. The wayfarers that turned aside here to rest are
                  always resting. The rivers and the springs, for ever fed, for ever flow; and the
                  hearts that sinned, and suffered, and repented wait in silence until the time when
                  all things shall be made new, when unvexed skies shall shine on a regenerated
                  earth, when all the world shall be as Eden of old, the garden of the Lord; when
                  every heart shall be royal, and when the history of Good Fellows shall be no more
                  full of haps and mishaps, darkening down to death, but a bright succession of
                  better and better things, sweeping up from glory to glory along the lofty eternal
                  heights which are given as the glad possession of an immortal race.</p>

               <p>THE following statements concerning inebriation and alcoholic and fermented
                  drinks, we have collated from various well-known authors, and offer now to the
                  serious consideration of the readers of the haps and mishaps of "The Best Fellow
                  in the World":</p>
               <p>"Water is the only fluid which does not possess irritating, or at least
                  stimulating, qualities; and in proportion as we rise on the scale of potation,
                  from table-beer to ardent spirits, in the same ratio we educate the stomach and
                  bowels for that state of morbid sensibility which in civilized life will sooner or
                  later supervene."—<hi rend="i"/>Dr. Johnson.</p>
               <p>"Every kind of intoxication disturbs the voluntary operations of the mind by
                  poisoning the brain, and thence impeding the influence of the will upon the
                  circulation, by preventing its control over the nerves of sense and action."—<hi
                     rend="i"/>Dr. Jones in "Man, Moral and Physical."</p>
               <p>"Interfering with the affinity existing between the blood and the air, allowing
                  the accumulation of carbon or other noxious agents in the circulating fluid, and
                  thus arresting the action of the nervous system."—<hi rend="i"/>Dr. Moore.</p>
               <pb n="350-351" xml:id="VAC8381-00000176"/>
               <p>"By disturbing the chemistry of life to such a degree that the nerve-matter no
                  longer duly subserves its purpose as a medium through which the soul exercises
                  volition and perceives sensation."—<hi rend="i"/>Drs. Good and Cullen, quoted by
                  Dr. Jones.</p>
               <p>Hippocrates declared that water is the most reasonable and useful drink, and, more
                  than any other, suited to the necessities of the human frame.</p>
               <p>"It is remarkable that all the diseases arising from drinking spirituous or
                  fermented liquors are liable to become hereditary, even to the third generation;
                  increasing, if the cause be continued, till the family becomes extinct."—<hi

               <p>"It is earnestly desired that no such experiment will ever be repeated in the
                  armies of the United States. In our own mind, the conviction is established by the
                  experience and observation of a life, that the regular routine of alcoholic
                  stimulants by a man in health is never in any circumstances useful. We make no
                  exceptions in favor of cold, or heat, or rain, nor, indeed, in favor of old
                     drinkers."—<hi rend="i"/>Dr. F. H. Hamilton, work on "Military Surgery," pp.
