CHAPTER I.&#xD;
&#xD;
Entered according to act of Congress, in the year 1854,&#xD;
By U. B. PEARsoN,&#xD;
in the Clerk's Office of the district Court of the United States for the&#xD;

"Aba! vish me one joy!    Five, sev-an, ten tousand great pla-&#xD;
sair, Madame Lessaire-vish Marie mosh -ten .tousand great joy I&#xD;
Mother ! mother! I have done with my rehearsal, I pleased the&#xD;

And the poor.old Frenchman, in the exuberance of his enthusidm,&#xD;
at the dawn of promise of his airy-like daughter, or at the success of&#xD;
her final rehearsal as an artiste in the ballet of the Metropolitan The-&#xD;
ater, made sundry gyrations and )erformed various pirouettes over the&#xD;
floor of the limited area of his humble apartment. Marie threw her&#xD;
tiny, sylph-like figure into the arms of her mother, unable to express&#xD;
in more audible language than the quick anl intonating throbs of her&#xD;
pure heart, the deep emotions of the moment.&#xD;
The present, perhaps, will serve to give an outline of the artiste&#xD;
and his interesting family. Monsieur Lessaire owed his birth to the&#xD;
small dot on the sea which has secured a tart uichle in geographical&#xD;
history, from having produced the greatestof all recorded' martial&#xD;
heroes-need we name-Corsica. Early cast forth into the vortex of&#xD;
human hopes and struggles for subsistence,' Lessaire, from thie scllion&#xD;
'occupation of a smuggler's "loblolly boy,"-found his way into the&#xD;
great world condensed-Paris--and soon atter, into the studio of an&#xD;
artiste in images and fresco ornaments. This pleased the boy far&#xD;

better than the nautical duties of a junior drudge in contraband specula&#xD;
tions, and he clung to it with a will and genius that so won upon the&#xD;
confidence and regard of his master, thl upon his death he resigned&#xD;
his shop and trade to Lessaire ; so tha at twenty the orsican boy&#xD;
foundhiimself master of a little, happy independence as well as a&#xD;
large shareholder in the heart an  * ~rity of the present Mad. Les-&#xD;
saire, then the petite amour of a dozen of the young bouryeose of&#xD;
her neighborhood, as well as the pct of her father, a gray veteran of&#xD;
the orchestra of pme of the principal theaters of the French capital.&#xD;
Young Lessaire won his prize;; the image-maker presently tinud&#xD;
around him different and dearer works of art and nature than thoe&#xD;
molded in clay and plaster. Lessaire loved music. For years he had&#xD;
nourished this little penchant, until the exciteiuent of business and love&#xD;
affairs, and the ardent dreams of matrimony, had all softened down&#xD;
into fixed realities of domestic tranquillity and comfort, and then burst&#xD;
a     forth this latent inspiration for music, like long pent-up volcanic fires,&#xD;
slowing how strongly struggles our instinctive passions, which some&#xD;
slight but fortuitous circumstance in the drama of life'gives vent,&#xD;
and the pure flame becomes the bright star of our lucky future, or&#xD;
the ignie fate of a perverse pilgrimage from the cradle to the&#xD;
grave.&#xD;
At thirty, Lessaire assumed the place of honor and profit on the&#xD;
right lde of the leader of the orchestra, so-long held by Madame Les.&#xD;
saire's father, who now, too old to fill a wind instrument or draw his&#xD;
favorite bow, retired,.rejoicing in the proficiency lie had imparted to&#xD;
his son-in-law, continuing to be his preceptor, as well as skill his lisp.&#xD;
ing grandchildren in the earlier branches of his art, to the end of his&#xD;
days, and then leaving his blessings, and little worldly store, the old&#xD;
man was quietly laid in his toIib, and the well-love, long-worn vio-&#xD;
lin of the grand ire, became tdevee  e   loomtefhe inage&#xD;
maker and his family.         ve~~dhi-om6           h  na~&#xD;
Gustave, Lessaire's eldest child, was, by consci'ption, enlisted in&#xD;
Napoleon's grand arimy, at fifteen, a musician and a soldier. The&#xD;
blow fell heavy upon Mad. Lessaire.  Gustave was their only son,&#xD;
their first born, and a  most promising pupil in iusic and sculp-&#xD;
ture; his father's fondest hopes were centered in tie boy, whale to the&#xD;
mother he was heart, soul, and life itself. Few mothers do or Can&#xD;
love like Frenchwomen, and as sue saw the boy depart in the train of&#xD;
the greatest of warriors-while the clang of arms, the braying of trum&#xD;
pets, and the loud viuas of the excited Citizens, told how enrapturing&#xD;
the scene was to them-she wept as a fond mother, and saw, in the&#xD;
obscure future, carnage and peril more distinct and apparent than the&#xD;
ephetiier'al glories ef victory and triumnphant return.&#xD;
Marie, the tiny duplicate of the uiiisician's wife in her blooming&#xD;
hour, was left them ; the bright-eyed, little ringlet-deckedf creature&#xD;
partaking more of heaven and its purity than mortal construction,&#xD;
&#xD;
was left the angel of goodness and hope ; the bright star of their&#xD;
heart an I home.&#xD;
Timu passed ; the shock of.contending armies, the drain of blood&#xD;
nd tranre of France, by Napoleon, at last threw gloom anwi sorrow&#xD;
ver the Frenci capital. Hearths made desolate, and the forced levies&#xD;
f fathers, brothers, and sons, to fill up the gaps of columns made&#xD;
v id by ball and bayonet, disease, fatigue, and capture, hushed the&#xD;
u ual merry ium, the gay, dashing, anl vivaciousness of the capital&#xD;
men fled, or were carried off; families were desecrated or broken up&#xD;
places of amusement were deserted or closed, and Lessaii'e saw naught&#xD;
but da"k clouds of adversity arising in his future. Discharged ti*&#xD;
the orchestra, the army or emigration was the choice; he could not&#xD;
leave France, and his son away fighting her battles ; he could not&#xD;
endure the idea of being separated from his little but precious family.&#xD;
IIapily, to settle a point so full of importance to them, news reached&#xD;
the'musician.that the son, in consequence of a wound received in an&#xD;
engagement, would be discharged and return home. This infornma-&#xD;
tion came to Lessaire in an unquestionable shape, and accompa-&#xD;
nied also by a verbal injunction for the father to quit France as soon&#xD;
as practicable. Fly to America, paid the son's message, at once ; the&#xD;
Em peror will not leave an able-bodied citizen alive or unenlistel, if&#xD;
this war continues; fly to America, with mother and Marie, my dear,&#xD;
dear little sister, and I will follow-be sure of that, as soon as my&#xD;
condition will permit.&#xD;
The musician an his family prepared and left France with heavy&#xD;
hearts' it was sa 1 to go, but death to stay. They left France. and&#xD;
their 'kolized Gustave behind, never to be re-united in hope and hap.&#xD;
piiess again.&#xD;

when weeks were succeeded by months,, and months settled into&#xD;

of their hearts-our son is gone-dead, dead,, dead-gone forever&#xD;

MARIE LESSAIRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
At nine, she became proficient in music; the danse had no less attrac.&#xD;
tions for her youthful. fancy, and she cultivated this art with such a&#xD;
fervor that at ten years of age she was considered not only a 1irtuoeo&#xD;
in music, but belle of the bah des assembl.'es Nouvelle d'Or-leans.&#xD;
At this time, Mons. Lessaire had been in America five years; his&#xD;
talents aided by bon fortune, had enabled him to realize-in cornece-&#xD;
tion with his little savings, patrimony, etc., brought from home-a&#xD;
very snug competence fhr future arlvents. Iope and fortune now&#xD;
began again to revive the hopes of the expatriated family ; the sunshine&#xD;
f. Jtappoiss began to cast its broad rays of refulgent light down upon&#xD;
their patti ol life.            ~ai onuo&#xD;
Experience teaches the most indifferent observer of life's changes,&#xD;
that human happiness and repose hangs by a very delicate thread : the&#xD;
slightest flaw severs it; and from high hopes and bright fortune, we&#xD;
fall into the pits of' despair, or writhe with poverty, until death closes&#xD;
the eventful drama.&#xD;
Oh ! how sorrowfully did the musician and his family realize this&#xD;
uncertainty of earthly promises and expectations, for in one unlucky hour&#xD;
Mons. Lessaire fonnd the entire bulk of his little fortune swept from&#xD;
him by a financial crisis that spread over the country some years ago.&#xD;
The blow was heavy and terrible enough, but another followed ; le&#xD;
was prostrated by the epidemic of the country, yellow fever, while his&#xD;
wife and lovely daughter were soon also fast bOund in the fetters of&#xD;
the same deadly disease. Friends, acquaintances, they had plenty, but&#xD;
as all were alike more or less steeped in the same dire pecuniary calam-&#xD;
ity, and physical scourge of the climate. the bonds of friendship, regard&#xD;
for talents, genius, and station, were either so greatly relaxed or neu-&#xD;
tralized as to leave each to struggle in his oten miisfortune, single-&#xD;
handed, as best he might. The poor musician survived both the loss&#xD;
of his fortune an-l health, but the stronghold of the mind ,was so&#xD;
inroaded, the physical capacities so shattered, that the capable and&#xD;
fortunate preceptor of the most popular musical academy in the south-&#xD;
ern ,metropolis, of a few weeks previous, 101111(1 himself scarcely able&#xD;
to fill the duties of lea thing the orchestra of a very indifferent-theater.&#xD;
To men of mind, aI pecuniary prostration is nothing, compared to&#xD;
loss of caste by deientation, or loss of capacity for their usual and&#xD;
loved pursuits. This so agonized Mons. Lessaire that he deternminied&#xD;
to leave the second scene of his prosperity and happiness, for new and&#xD;
diverting ones, that time migut the more readiy deface or enveil his&#xD;
afflictions. Paris of the new continent, New York, became his mark,&#xD;
and after the restoration of his health, and that of Mad. Lessaire and&#xD;
Marie, and , an affectionate fimitwell to such few friends as really&#xD;
remained to them, they sailed thither.&#xD;
Many youthful hearts beat sorrowinl when "ad'eu " was pronounced&#xD;
by the charming little angel friend, Marie ; and she, though  flying al&#xD;
that childish delight attendant upon jaunt and travel, breathed deeply&#xD;
&#xD;
M~ARIE L ESSA1RE.&#xD;
&#xD;
13&#xD;
&#xD;
and sadly as the companions of hen sunny hours 'and merry sports,&#xD;
pleasures and pastimes, hovered around, and each presented some&#xD;
petite b jouterie or amulette as a simple offering of real, hearts to be&#xD;
indly remembered.&#xD;
There was one, a dark-eyed, elegantly-featured boy, who stood pen-&#xD;
sively aloof as his young friends gathered about the deparimg idol of&#xD;
their little coterie, waiting for a parting word from one whom it was&#xD;
evident he, of all the rest, was most loth to desire, yet anxious to have.&#xD;
The youthful "queen of hearts " turned to the boy, and withi a side&#xD;
glce so coyish and penetratingthat his gage was fairly inverted,&#xD;
iegcwhile a glow of real bashfulness overspread his well-defiled features,&#xD;
-    she said:yo&#xD;
"Oh, Georgy, you there? Well, adieu; bless you, bless you all,&#xD;
all-we shall meet again."&#xD;
" I-I hope we shall, often, Marie," replied the stammering boy,&#xD;
as lie still held the tiny rosy fngers of his little goddess. "I've&#xD;
a present, Marie," he continued, "'t is not much,. but pray accept it,&#xD;
and-"&#xD;
"Keep it, keep it, dear Georgy, for your sake, I will ;" and as she&#xD;
said this, the little belle gave the still confused boy a hearty shake of&#xD;
the hand, accepted his enveloped packet, saluted her lovely little&#xD;
female friends, bade them twenty times over adieu, and the scene closed.&#xD;
The calamities that had so desolated hearths and fortunes n the&#xD;
southern metropolis, had dealt no lighter with the great nort ern ei-&#xD;
porium. Mons. Lessaire found New York ny thing but ,li El'Do-&#xD;
rado to him. A brief engagement in a musical school tei mated&#xD;
with a serious siege of illness ; a stranger in a strange land minnahis&#xD;
situation deplorable enough. They had sold such and all of t 'r&#xD;
worldly effects as were disposable, prior to, leaving .the South; ;e&#xD;
proceeds of these disposals, in sickness and without the mean f&#xD;
replenishment, soon drained the last sous from their purse, and at the&#xD;
end of the first year, Moris. Lessaire and his family were on the verge&#xD;
of hopeless misery and poverty. What to do, whither to turn, the&#xD;
poor musician knew   not. In a stroll through one of the many&#xD;
crowded thoroughfares of the great city of wealth and poverty, vice,&#xD;
rr -      virtue, despair-hungry, sad, and weary, the poor musician encoun-&#xD;
tered an old and familiar face; they rush together, they clasp each&#xD;
other warm and cordially by the hand. The familiar face belonged to&#xD;
an old musical friend, with whom Lessaire had drawn the bow in the&#xD;
orchestras of Paris, and the meeting was one of great joy to Mons.&#xD;
;        Lessaire. Reasonably so, for it led to immediate personal assistance;&#xD;
the brother musician accompanied Lessaire to his obscure abode, and&#xD;
soon relieved it of the pecuniary depression hanging over the fallen&#xD;
fortunes of the little and interesting family.&#xD;
. "Be happy, and cheer' up, mon chere," .said the ben vivant music&#xD;
clan ; patting the lovely Marie upon the cheek, and kissing her little&#xD;

hand ; he turned to Madame and bade her be of good heart ; "better&#xD;
things in store for you."&#xD;
"Care killed tle cat, mon bon amie!  Get you some refreshments&#xD;
Lessaire, and then go with me, I will introduce you to the leader of&#xD;
the orchestra at the theater; he is an Englishman, but a good fellow;&#xD;
we want artistes for the new ballet; you shall do well. That is right,&#xD;
look lively, mon bon komme; now come along; idieu, Madame ; au&#xD;
revoir, Mademoiselle Marie; come, Monsieur."&#xD;
And with a much lighter heart and foot, Mons. Lessaire followed&#xD;
Mignard, his loquacious and good-hearted friend, to the  theater;&#xD;
where a brief interview with a musical director was sufficient to pro-,&#xD;
cure a situation, the best lie could command in the shattered state of&#xD;
his health,.and more affected spirit of ambition that characterized his&#xD;
early essays in the art. 'The situation was subordinate, and pay inca-&#xD;
ger, but he felt eager to be employed, and the desire to resist the&#xD;
attacks of squalid poverty, and give cheerfulness to his fireside, nerved&#xD;
him to the task. And once more their little home assumed an air of&#xD;
comfort and vivacity. Marie was now a well grown girl, light and&#xD;
agile as the antelope, graceful and beautiful as a fairy; the few who&#xD;
saw her could but love and reirember her. Cut off from the gy&#xD;
scenes  and merry companions of lr late southern home, poor girl,&#xD;
she passed her time but drearily enough, at best. But, inheriting all&#xD;
the naivette and vivacious temperament peculiar to Parisians, she did&#xD;
not sour her face or mind with mortifying chagrin because of her pov-&#xD;
erty. No, the dear girl made the best of her sombre fortune ; she&#xD;
merrily fingered their old piano, companion of all their meanderings;&#xD;
sang to her mother~the merry airs of la belle France, and their sun-&#xD;
shiny days; tired of this, the father at home, he would draw the bow,&#xD;
and the sylph-like girl practiced and improved her dance, little&#xD;
dreaming, however, at the time, that her perfection in this graceful&#xD;
art of motion would make her as great a pet with the public of the&#xD;
theater as she had ever been in the grand balls of New Orleans.&#xD;
Marie frequently attended her father to the morning rehearsals, so&#xD;
that in the course of a few months she becanie familiar and quite a&#xD;
favored visitor to the attaches of the establishment. One great artiste&#xD;
in the ballet had visited the country with such immense success, that&#xD;
negotiations had been opened between the manager of the Metropo-&#xD;
litan Theater and another of the most famed danseuse in Europe.&#xD;
She was on the eve of coming over; her maitre de ballet and others&#xD;
of her attaches were already rehearsing and preparing for her debut.&#xD;
Mons. and Mad. Lessaire were prod of their daughter's proficiency&#xD;
in dancing, though it never occurred to them to allow Marie to dance&#xD;
in the ballet. Necessity, the famed mother of so much invention,'&#xD;
suggested to Mons., and lie to Mad. Lessaire, the probable profitable-&#xD;
ness likely to result from Marie engaging in the cope de ballet of the&#xD;
great danseuse about to visit the country. A little meditation resolved&#xD;
&#xD;
them to enlist their child in the ballet corps at once ; and interview was&#xD;
held with the maitre de ballet, a few rehearsals were given, and the&#xD;
already great proficiency in the art, elegance and grace of the young&#xD;
Parisian, at once claimed.for her the first position, in the ballet corps.&#xD;
This was an advent of great and unexpected joy to the poor musician;&#xD;
and when at last, after many rehearsals of his daughter's, the maitre&#xD;
de ballet cane to Lessaire, shook his hand, complimented his child,&#xD;
assigned her her position with a salary of twenty dollars per week,&#xD;
he was almost wild with joy, and ran home with Marie under his arm,&#xD;
at a pace that fairly astonished the loungers in the streets.&#xD;

The joy of Mons. Lessaire scarce knew bounds; he embraced and&#xD;
kissed fJarie, lie embraced his wife, and shouted in the accents of his&#xD;
buoyant spirits.&#xD;
"We shall now be happy, we shall now be able to live in ze com-&#xD;

Mad. Lessaire was more thoughtful of the practical. Marie had&#xD;
gone on with her rehearsals, it is true, without either of their arriving&#xD;
at any definite idea of the result, or, in case of her success, what&#xD;
would be necessary to prepare, in way of wardrobe, and the etceteras&#xD;
of a ballet dancer's equipment. It was to be thought of now.&#xD;
"Marie must have ze grand bal costume, ze satin slippaire, z&#xD;

"We have not a dollar in the world," said Mad. Lessaire, in a very&#xD;

"That is true, very true," responded Mons. IL., as he paced the&#xD;
poorly furnished and dingy apartment. "But I will see the manager,&#xD;

MARIE LESSAIRE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Aba ! ha! my little queen, it is you; pardon me, Marie, I wish&#xD;
you great, great joy; the engagement will set you all right. Mons.&#xD;
,M arie will make a great 'it, she will succeed, she will he very&#xD;
popular, and she will make much money for you all, my good friends,"&#xD;
exclaimed Mignard.                              Y           ,&#xD;
"But we have misfortune," said Madame lessaire.&#xD;
Misfortune !. How is that?" inquired the jolly musician.&#xD;
"Alas! we have not a sous, Monsieur, to purchase dresses for&#xD;
Marie's debut."&#xD;
"That is bad," pondered the musician, "that is bad, I did not think&#xD;
of that. Alas ! I am poor too, I have not enough money in the world&#xD;
to buy her shoes!"&#xD;
"What shall we do? ° what shall we do?" despondingly echoed the&#xD;
father; "we shall have no money, no friends."    a&#xD;
"keep good heart now, mon here amoie," replied Mignard- "I&#xD;
will tell you what to do; apply at the office, the manager will advance&#xD;
at least one week's salary, that will do to begin,'you see."&#xD;
"I have thought of him," responded Lessaire ; " to-night we will&#xD;
see him, if os-e-bil."&#xD;
"Do so, Monsieur; but keep good heart; Mademoiselle shall yet&#xD;
have her grand costume de ballet, and, with, the assistance .of very&#xD;
little ornament, she will be the little fairy belle of the grand dan$e.&#xD;
Mad-      is expected to arrive to-night or to-morrow from Europe,&#xD;
and the ballets will begin at once&#xD;
.Oh! I 'n so anxious 1o begin," said Marie, " that I care not how&#xD;
plain or little my dress may be."'&#xD;
"That's right, my little angel, keep good heart; the maitre de bal-&#xD;
let, the musicians, every body, safs you are sure of the grand success -&#xD;
keep up good courage and all is well."&#xD;
And the man of hope and jollity, who, poor fellow, received but a&#xD;
nominal sum for his services? had nothing t,' spare his friends, left&#xD;
them as abruptly as lie had visited them.&#xD;
Ie had scarcely gone from-the house, when, without knock or " by&#xD;
our leave, quite a diflferen) personage entered. Ie was the land-&#xD;
lord ofthe premises ; rent was due him ; the vicissitudes of human&#xD;
nature was onesithing, and money making was another. Like count-&#xD;
less thousands of one-idea people, old Prog, the landlord, could see&#xD;
no reason why people were poor, moneyless, and unable to pay rent,&#xD;
at least !&#xD;
"We can 't keep property for those who do n't pay up their rent;-&#xD;
my maxim is, pay your rent if you cheat the undei-taker. While&#xD;
you live you must have a house to live in, you know; if you die, why&#xD;
a-a-there 's somebody bound to put you' away, do n't you see ?¢" said&#xD;
the old Shylock.&#xD;
" I now comprehend, Monsieur. - I have no money, sair, not one&#xD;
sous; I have ze great misfortune," replied the musician.&#xD;
&#xD;
" Come, come, Monsher, it is no use for you to go into a long rig-&#xD;
marole about Voum' mistortunes ; itf listened to people's nmistortunes,&#xD;
I'd come out at the little cud of the horn. 'Taint the way I got my&#xD;
money and property. There 's that gal of yours, what does she del&#xD;
Bhe's big enough to earn something, an 1 oauht n't t  b3 i le.&#xD;
My poUr child will soon be employed ; alas ! I once hoped my&#xD;
children iould nev-air come to want. pov-air-tee, or be obliged to seek&#xD;
employment among the stran-gairs, but it must be so now," said Mons.&#xD;
Lessaire, inma tone of sorrow.&#xD;
" Of course she should go to work," responded (old Prog; " none&#xD;
of you should be idle when your rent is (ime ; it is n't law or gospel.&#xD;
The first duty of a Christian is to pay his rent, punctually and taith.&#xD;
fully ; there is no earthly sin so bad as cheating a landlord, and if ]&#xD;
had the making of the ten conmminaniments, I would make'cmi eleven-&#xD;
the last should be-whosoever swi lieth his landlord, by rung o&#xD;
at night and leaving a month's or week's rent due, shall be damms&#xD;
straight; yes, I wouldl" and to clinch the determination, 01(1 Prog&#xD;
brought'his heavy gold-headed cane down upon the floor, with such a&#xD;
rap that the corls of the piano vibrated.&#xD;
"Yes and there you've got a pianer, too ; pretty note, can't pay&#xD;
your rent. elhi ?Gota pianer ail can't pay your rent I Go sell the&#xD;
thing. carry it down to auction and sell it. set your gal to work, pay&#xD;
me imy rent by the end of the week, or I'll finda way to get it pretty&#xD;
soon," si(1 the renimorseless love' of gold.&#xD;
" Monsieur," said Madame Lessaire, " we are, through much mis-&#xD;
fortune, very pool' ; our daughter has just obtained an engagement at&#xD;
the Theater ; we have just debated how we ever can furnish oun&#xD;
daughter with dresses for her )el'o'mmmanee."&#xD;
" Ohm, ho, going on the stage, eli? Does she sing, dance, or play&#xD;
the pianer, or what does she do ? "&#xD;
" Marie does all three, Monsieur," replied Madame.&#xD;
"Well, I come to look at her, she looks like a smart gal enough&#xD;
how oldis she ? " asked old Prog.&#xD;
In her thirteenth year, Monsieur."&#xD;
" Pretty good siz dgal; come here, sis, let me look at you."&#xD;
Manners and courtesy are born in the French. Marie, though&#xD;
accosted in a rude and uncivil manner, approached the old ruffian with&#xD;
gaiety and good humor.&#xD;
" Nice little gal enough ; so you are going on the stage, e?"&#xD;
X Yes, sir," modestly replied'Marie.&#xD;
" What part are you going to take in the theater?"&#xD;
"1 am to dance in the ballet. sir."&#xD;
"Dance in the bully, eh? Well, I suppose you will get better wages&#xD;
than working in a shop or doing house-work, and dancing is more fun&#xD;
than work for the young ; it used to be to ime" '&#xD;
"It is very fatiguing, sir," responded Marie.&#xD;

MARIE LESSA1IRE.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, every thing becomes fatiguing and hard when it is called&#xD;
work; how much will you get a week for dancing?"&#xD;
Twenty dollars, sir; I believe my father said so."&#xD;
# Yes, mmy child, that is it," answered the father.&#xD;
"Twen-ty dol-lars a week !" echoed old Prog, "why, God bless&#xD;
te, you'll get rich at that."&#xD;
Marie and her parents were forced into a smile, when the mother&#xD;
reptil'd,&#xD;
" The salary, Monsieur, will come very timely for us; it is not much,&#xD;
after my daughter's expenses are paid out of it, but she-will get better&#xD;
said presently.&#xD;
"Well, I do 'at .know what you call good wages, or how you can&#xD;
mpnage to spend so much money, but I know I could make a decent,&#xD;
fortune on twenty dollars a week in the course of a few years. You&#xD;
lnght to live cheap, be saving and close ; lay out no money in nick.&#xD;
nacks, gew-gaws, or toru-foolery; save your money and pay your&#xD;
ent punctually, and you hl get along easy enough, and lay by money."&#xD;
"Well," lie continued,   when do you expect to pay the rent?"&#xD;
"Alas! Monsieur, we do not know. Our daughter will commence&#xD;
er engagement next week, but we are now in great trouble."&#xD;
4' Great, trouble I Why, what's the matter now ? "inquired Prog.&#xD;
"We have not the means of getting our daughter the necessary&#xD;
resses for her  ppearance on the stage ; we know not what we&#xD;
shall do, it will cost us twenty-five or forty dollars to procure dresses."&#xD;
"That's bad business, that's a fact ; but if you stir around yoy 'It&#xD;
aake it out somehow, I suppose; I'll wait a few days longer,hen&#xD;
L'Ii send my son after the rent, and do n't you fool me; have your rent&#xD;
heady, and you'll find me your friend.".&#xD;
Valuable friendship this, fold sinner and gold seeker. It is the same&#xD;
Ieihgion, however, pervading human society every where; some may&#xD;
rot so boldly or unblushingly acknowledge their motive for friendly&#xD;
sessions, but at the bottom of the well the keen observer will, find&#xD;
aic truth of the matter. Self-interest, after all is said and done, is the&#xD;
main-spring of the human mind and heart. The statesman, soldier,&#xD;
and artist, like the farmer, mechanic, an] maiden, if you will, with&#xD;
patriots, philosophers, tnd preachers, all have a mission to perform ;&#xD;
that mission's propulsive power is self-interest, more or less developed&#xD;
&amp;amp;o the eye of the observer.                       e&#xD;
Cares and ills of life seldom come singly ; the poor artist, on the&#xD;
eve of distraction at his perverse. fortunes, becomes a little elated at&#xD;
the tiny star of hope arising in the dark horizon of his fate, in the&#xD;
shape of his darling child. But this little hope is depressed with&#xD;
obstacles that naught but money can move ; of that he has none, and&#xD;
even when feeling his way along through the dim vista of life's pass-&#xD;
age, he mects a relentless ghoul, who, insteal of fanning and fostering&#xD;
the worthy motive of the poor musician's heart and mind, by patronage&#xD;
&#xD;
MARiE LESSA'RE.&#xD;
and soothing words, he drives hope and energy nearly from his cast-&#xD;
down soul, and with the cold and careless apathy of a man bent&#xD;
upon his own pecuniary salvation, adds to the load of a suffering&#xD;
fellow creature,. in place of lending him friendly advice and, encour-&#xD;
agement. Prisons and penal codes are all numerous for punishment&#xD;
of vice; there are also sympathizing societies for condoling with the&#xD;
vicious and condemned, but none seem to care for the struggling,&#xD;
hard-faring, and brave-fighting, virtuous poor, who, alone, single-&#xD;
handed, heroically breast the manifold temptations and pangs of pov-&#xD;
city in the grand battle of life. If they triumph, they are scarel4&#xD;
recognized, and~ no wise exalted; if they fall, the common hand&#xD;
andl tongue are turned with the deadly venom of a viper against them.&#xD;
In a mood of dark and gloomy thought, the poor muisician sought&#xD;
his way to the theater ; the manager was absst, and his .subordinate&#xD;
infiomed Mons. Lessaire that they never adyhnced salaries. lie spoke&#xD;
to the maitre de ballet; that person declined, as he stated he had no&#xD;
instructions or means to prepare the principals of the ballet with&#xD;
wardrobe, which was costly, and always provided. at the expense.of&#xD;
the danseuse.&#xD;
"What shall I do?" sighed the poor Frenchman, as he sat in the&#xD;
orchestra. "Marie must appear ; it will lead to ze grand advantage.&#xD;
She must appear, but how?  how can we procure ze costume, I do&#xD;
not know, ah, I do not know ; we shall hope for somezing better."&#xD;
The night was cold,-cheerless, and dark; by a handfhl of coals&#xD;
burning in the contracted grate of their very obscure apartment, sat&#xD;
Mad. Lessaire and her daughter - Marie's head reclining on the lap&#xD;
of the mother, who was beguiling the heavy hours of absence of the&#xD;
husband and father, by tales, stories, and reminiscences of their natal&#xD;
ipme-la belle France.&#xD;
"She sleeps, dear soul," at length said Mad. L. "Poor child, that&#xD;
we should ever live to hope for better days through thy providence and&#xD;
'abor ; but heaved bless poor dear. Marie, no sacrifice or tatigue of&#xD;
dine would be too heavy or toilsome for thy good heart to make foir&#xD;
papa or mama."&#xD;
Mother," said, Marie, without changing her position, "dear&#xD;
another, I have just been thinking&#xD;
"have you not been sleeping, dear child I"&#xD;
"No, dear mother, I've been thinking how we shall manage our&#xD;
little trouble; I have some jewels, some presents made me, you knows&#xD;
by our friends of New Orleans; there is that handsome bracelet pre-&#xD;
sented by George Pinckney, we all think it set with diamonds; it the&#xD;
stones be real diamonds, then it is valuable, dear mother, and we can&#xD;
surely sell it for enough to buy all that I require for my debut, au&#xD;
after nights."&#xD;
Malaie Lessaire remained thoughtful a few moments, but soon&#xD;

part with it freely. IHa! there comes my father; not a word, mother,&#xD;

Marie flew to open the door for her lather, and wet and' cold as he&#xD;
was with rain and piercing air, she embraced him, and then took his&#xD;
od violin case toput it away in its accustomed place.&#xD;
"Ah, good, good child, mon chere Marie ; it is too bad, it is too&#xD;

took of his grief. But he rallied.&#xD;

"My prop-air-tee?  No, Monsieur, it is not mine."&#xD;
"how did you come by it, then?" returned the jeweler.&#xD;
"It was a present, Monsieur, a present from a friend."&#xD;
"Ohio! yes, I see; wait one moment.- John," said he, scribbling&#xD;
-   few lines on a card, and handing it to his clerk, "take this to Mr.&#xD;
Brown, and tell him those things are ready(!)" The clerk took the&#xD;
hint and started, while the jeweler beguiled the few minutes that&#xD;
passed, in examining the bracelet, and praising its very handsome&#xD;
appearance. But what was Mons. L.'s surprise when the clerk&#xD;
entered with a rough, rude looking man, who addressed'the jeweler.&#xD;
" Is this-the feller?"&#xD;
"Yes; here he offers a bracelet for sale, which is worth a hundred&#xD;
dollars, and can not give any satisfactory account how it came in his&#xD;
possession!."&#xD;
"Mon Dieu! what is this you shall mean, elm ?"&#xD;
"Come along with me, old feller;" said the officer, rudely grasping&#xD;
the poor musician, and endeavoring to drag him from the shop. He&#xD;
would liste to no explanation, but took Mons. L., accompanied by&#xD;
the jeweler, to the police office, where the poor Frenchman was so&#xD;
nervous and agitated as to be scarcely able to give the explanation&#xD;
necessary for his release; but which lie finally did in such a touching&#xD;
and simple manner as to greatly win upon.'the good feelings of the&#xD;
jeweler, who, after Mons. L.'s discharge from custody, insisted on&#xD;
his return to the store, and told him that he would not buy the brace-&#xD;
let, but in consideration of the apparent distresses of his family&#xD;
would advance him fifty dollars on it; place it in his show case, and&#xD;
keep it for a year or more, that Mons. L, might redeem it, should he&#xD;
ever be able or desirous of doing so. Mons. L. poured fortlh a torrent&#xD;
of thanks, accepted the money, shook the jeweler fraternally by'the&#xD;
hand, aid imade his way home with a lighter heart and brighter smite&#xD;
than had cheered his lonely way for a long, long time. The poor&#xD;
musician's adventure of the morning drew smiles and tears from his&#xD;
wife and daughter; but now they were once more afloat, hope onc,&#xD;
more her cheering smiles supplied the homu of the danseuse.&#xD;

"Well, well, let it go, if I must I must; but, hark you, sir, you&#xD;
will bring your father's gray hairs to a premature grave ; you'll bring&#xD;
disgrace and shame to your family; you'11 ruin and rob me, and-&#xD;
and-oo to the devil at last, you scoundrel, you."&#xD;
" Well, dad, there are plenty of our relatives there and on the&#xD;
road. If I go to purgatory, you can console yourself that I'nrot the&#xD;
first of the lamiy that went in that direction."&#xD;
You lie, you-you scamp, there 's not one of your father's or&#xD;
mother's kith or kin that ever conducted themselves in such an out.&#xD;
rageous, rascally, spendthrift manner' as you have, sir."&#xD;
No ! well. then the, world cursedly libels the memory of our&#xD;
ancestors, dad, for there 'a a devilish sharp rumor that your old dad&#xD;
and two of your brothers saved themselves a formal introduction to&#xD;
JackKetch, by taking an Atlantic trip to America, once upon a&#xD;
time."&#xD;
"'What'a that ? you infernal scoundrel ! "&#xD;
"Oh, only   little smuggling, dad, somehow or other mixed up&#xD;
with a suspicitm of piracy! You see 1 'in quite posted up, old boy,&#xD;
in the genealogy of the family!"&#xD;
Old Josiah Prog -- for it was he and his interesting eldest 'son,&#xD;
Josiah Prog, Jr., engaged in the above discussion--grew livid in the&#xD;
face; he l)aced the apartment, nervous with rage; he would have&#xD;
smote his rakish, dissolute son with a look, could he have conimanded&#xD;
such a basilisk virtue ; but, after walking, snorting, and snufiing him-&#xD;
self somewhat free of his gall ; during which tiine young Prog sat&#xD;
twirling his watch seals, enchantingly cool, around his fingers ; he&#xD;
approached a large, old-fashioned secretary, seated himself, and began&#xD;
to overhaul various memorandums, bills, etc.&#xD;
"Joe Prog, listen to me," said the old miserly creature.&#xD;
"Upon one condition," answered the hopeful. "No sermons."&#xD;
"ou '11 not hear many more from me, 1 promise you."&#xD;
"Amen," replied the son. "Now go ahead, for I 've engagements&#xD;
this morning, and no time to lose."&#xD;
" Engagements ! yes, engagements to rob your poor old gray-haired&#xD;
parent of his hard, honestly earned dollars, to squander on gambler$&#xD;
&#xD;
MARIE LESSAIRE.&#xD;
and narlots; them 's the engagements and contracts you are daily&#xD;
making and fulfilling."&#xD;
"Cut it short, cut it short, old man, come to business-no more of&#xD;
our fictions, philosophy, and puritanical groans ; you know me and&#xD;
I [ know you."&#xD;
"I wish to God I could contradict that," moaned the father.&#xD;
"The possibility would be cursedly agreeable to me; I've thought&#xD;
so a thousand times, dad ; but go on, let us settle this little business&#xD;
matter first; then talk of abstract matters and things afterward."&#xD;
"Joe Prog, you're a villain," muttered the old man, as he fum-&#xD;
bled around aiong his papers. -&#xD;
" Thank'you," replied the son, "it's hereditary, old fellow."&#xD;
"Joe Prog," continued the father, without seeming to notice the&#xD;
reply of the son.&#xD;
"Sir," answered Joe.&#xD;
"I 'ye not ten dollars in the world."P&#xD;
"Come, old man, do n't forget you own a pew in St. Pauls, and&#xD;
occupy it with a sabbatical regularity that astonishes. your oldest&#xD;
acquaintances; that won't do."&#xD;
"You villain, do you want to contradict your father ?",&#xD;
"My dear sir," said the son, in a mock respectful manner, "not for&#xD;
the continental universe !"&#xD;
"Then, I tell you, I've not ten dollars in the world. Do you hear&#xD;
that?"&#xD;
"Yes, I hear that ; and I know you have not ten dollars in that old&#xD;
rat trap before you-your world. Where your heart and soul is&#xD;
nourished and fed, that is your world, peopled by bundles and pack-&#xD;
ages of writs, deeds, bonds, mortgages, bills, and contracts, greasy,&#xD;
filthy parchments, and various accounts against me, as well as others ;&#xD;
not ten dollars there? why, I could grab ten thousand there, in the&#xD;
dark'" said the son.&#xD;
" I've plenty of -bills here, Joe, to collect," rejoined the father,&#xD;
"plenty of bills. If you'll throw off that finery, put on plain busi-&#xD;
ness apparel, look like, and act like, a resolute business man, that&#xD;
people's whines and lies could not shake, I'd--I'd give you a hundred&#xD;
dollars to go out this afternoon and collect me five or six hundre i&#xD;
dollars to meet bills to-morrow ; now there's a chance, Joe, to turn&#xD;
an honest penny; earn money first, then the joy and satisfaction of&#xD;
spending it is doubled!"&#xD;
"ha ! ha ! why, curse me, dad, if I do n't think it gives you more&#xD;
real pain to spend your hard earnings than I to get a chance in helping&#xD;
you alono- with it. That cock won't fight, dad."          ,,&#xD;
"Joe frog, do n't you ever intend to be steady, sober, and serious?"&#xD;
"My dear, venerable father, did you ever see a steadier, more seri-&#xD;
ous, and sober man of three and twenty, than the young gentleman&#xD;
now press ut?"&#xD;

"how long would you be so, if I put a hundred dollars in your nd I&#xD;
that s the question."&#xD;
"The profundity of the interrogative, dad, requires a little too much&#xD;
mathematical investigation for my present stock of leisure time; there-&#xD;
fore, let us postpone the subject to a more convenient season ; give me&#xD;
fifty dollars down, and I'll take your iiote for another difty, payable in&#xD;

"For a day or two, I suppose," interrupted the old man.&#xD;
"No, not for a whole week, for l'm going out of town to-morrow&#xD;
morning, and will be gone six days sure. Come, fork gut; do n't be&#xD;
so cussedly peevish and stingy, dad; you know that I'in the only one&#xD;
of the family that does draw on your purse; there is Bill and 'Ned,&#xD;
so busy with their law and physics, they hav'nt time to spend a dollar&#xD;
if they knew how; there's the girls, too, married off out of the way;&#xD;
and little Nance, too young to require capital; so you see  dvil-&#xD;
ishl palpable the fact is, that I 'in entitled to a large per cci t. on our&#xD;
income, merely to keep np the dignity of the house of Prog  It's a&#xD;
cussed poor family, says Shakspeare, or somebody else, that can't keep&#xD;
up one gentleman.",&#xD;
"Blast Shakspeare, and his play-acting nonsense ; if he had been&#xD;
an honest, upright, industrious young man, and paid as much atten-&#xD;
tion to the honest pursuits of his father-wool-growing and farming-&#xD;
he 'd been able to iave left more substantial proofs of his genius than&#xD;
a bundle of play-acting nonsense for people to throw their money&#xD;
away on now-a-days."&#xD;
"Pounds, shilhinos, and pence, el, dad I Large landed property,&#xD;
and a dozen curmudgeon heirs, the whole stock, root, and branch of&#xD;
which would have been scattered and forgotten a hundred years ago.&#xD;
Do n't venture, dad, in this enlightened age, to speak of the genius&#xD;
and works of the great bard with any expressions but those of venera-&#xD;
tion and eulogy, for the light of his mind will burn the brighter with&#xD;
each succeeding generation. But this has nothing to do with our little&#xD;
business transaction. What say you to the fifty down, and note for&#xD;
the balance at ten days ? "&#xD;
"Can't do it, you've drained me dry. I've paid your bills, time&#xD;
and again ; I 've kept you up in your, folly and extravagance as long&#xD;
as I can stand it, and I 'in obliged to stop off your supplies, at lasts&#xD;
and try the virtue of force, when all my good counsel, prayers, and&#xD;
entreaties have failed."&#xD;
"So you are going to shut down on me, el? Well, I told you&#xD;
what I would do, and I'll do it; you see that?"  Isere the profligate&#xD;
son drew forth from his breast pocket a small and beautifully-wrought&#xD;
pistol; drawing back the hammer of the lock, he stepped out into theT&#xD;
middle of the floor and deliberately placed the muzzle of the deadly&#xD;
weapon to his forehead-" Speak quick, give me the money, or have&#xD;
a coroner's inquest in your house !"&#xD;

Put-put up that terrible weapon, for God's sake. here, here,&#xD;
take all, ruin your father, beggar your family." Quite overcoimie with&#xD;
terror' and emotion, the old man threw himself upon the open front&#xD;
of his secretary, and gave vent to his excited feelings in a gush of&#xD;
tears, while the spoiled, petted, and dissipated son leisurely replaced&#xD;
his weapon in his pocket, and stepping trwar,1, placed his hanl&#xD;
upon the old man's shoulder; he slowly raised his head, their eyes met&#xD;
Joe Prog, did I ever think to live to experience such a scene as&#xD;
this ?" said the father.&#xD;
"Can 't regret it more than I do, dad."&#xD;
" Look af your brothers and sisters ! was ever one of them guilty&#xD;
of such total depravity? such, such a-entire want of regard for the&#xD;
felings and credit of their parent ? Joe Prog, it 's well your poor,&#xD;
dear iiother is dead and in her grave ; you'd break her heart all to&#xD;
pie es"&#xD;
Da1, the hundred dollars."&#xD;
" I tell you I've no money in the house ; her, are bills, go col&#xD;
lect them, over five hundred dollars, all due."&#xD;
" Ilan I them over; let me see who the devil they are on, or' what,&#xD;
they art all about. Rents, eli ? Worth about ten per cent. ; require&#xD;
more cursing'and swearing and bully-ragging to collect, than the whiols&#xD;
anonnt is worth. D-n me, I'll try them, right off; but mind, old&#xD;
man, I must have a hun lied dollars to-day, no fail, oi'you'Il rue it."&#xD;
S Au1 hark you-I hoje, if there's a spark of honesty in your&#xD;
iiifernal skin, you 'Ii not collect and keep the whole amount; it you&#xD;
do, mark me, you may beg, rot, die, and-and be-hanged, before&#xD;
I'd ever countenance you again. Now mark that," said the old man,&#xD;
with passion.&#xD;
But Jo Prog was out and gone before the concluding sentence&#xD;
smote upon his heedle'ss ear.&#xD;
Joe's first step was to sto)p in at the room of an artistic friend, who&#xD;
kept a bachelor's hall and studio on a thii'd floor of one of the many&#xD;
large and densely populated buildings on Broadway, between the Astor&#xD;
Ilouse and Grand street. To the artist, Joe reported his failure to,&#xD;
draw any real finds for an emergency they were mutually involved in;&#xD;
which was no more nor less than living so fir beyond their current&#xD;
means-indulging in the various luxuries, follies, and vices of a great&#xD;
metropolis like New York-and so beset by duns and officers of the'&#xD;
municipal government, as to make it highly necessary for their preseut&#xD;
comflort and convenience, to ste) out of town, if only for a fortlighl3t.&#xD;
for in that space of time the most wonderful matters, greatest excite-&#xD;
ment, immense lion, or hideous transaction, dies, fades out, or is par-&#xD;
tially forgotten in the strong and onward current of life and lunman&#xD;
dealings in that great, great city.&#xD;

"That is d-d bad," seid the artist, "if I stay hre four hours longer&#xD;
I shall be arrested for swindling; eve;y trap I've got here will be&#xD;
seized and taken away. There Is a portrait I was to have finished for&#xD;
a southern merchant; he has already more than paid me for it;. I was&#xD;
to have finished it yesterday ; but, curse me if I can work when 1 am&#xD;
80 pestered for funds."&#xD;
"And not a blessed daub will you make, Fred, while there's a shot&#xD;
in your locker, eli, old boy ? " observed Joe Prog.&#xD;
"You 're about half right, Proggy, my boy ; but what are we to do?&#xD;
By heavens ! it won't do to stay here ; we must change the scene,&#xD;
even for a week. There has been a dozpn calls for you here to-day-&#xD;
bootmakers, hatters, tailors, stable-keepe-s, restaurateurs, etc., etc., too&#xD;
tedious to mention. D-n me, Joe, I've got an idea-let 's go on a&#xD;
whaling cruise, that's the ticket."&#xD;
"Come, come, Freddy,' my boy, do n't go off half cocked. Yes,&#xD;
es, that's a pretty good double shuffle, and might make you a favorite&#xD;
n the greasy forecastle of a blubber-hunter ; the idea is vulgar, though,&#xD;
too cursed low for fellows of our address and love of the arts and&#xD;
Sciences."&#xD;
"Well, I'll hang up my fiddle, only you propose something more&#xD;
musical. how are we to raise the wind? Why the blazes did n't&#xD;
you draw it strong on the old man-storm his old fortress of money-&#xD;
bags, and bring him to his bearings?"&#xD;
"Did n't I? ,IIa! ha! you had better believe it. I drew it mild&#xD;
at first, but pitched in the sentimental afterward, strong-swore I'd&#xD;
blow out my brains   "&#xD;
"Did you? Well, that was a safe threat, Joe. Then what ?"&#xD;
"Then-I fetched him."&#xD;
"Did lie really fork for the twentieth time?"&#xD;
Swore he had n't a red cent ! "&#xD;
"Of course he did. Well ?"&#xD;
"I told hiu it would n't do, I must have the tin."&#xD;
"And finally he    "&#xD;
."Gave me a batch of bills to collect, and here they are."&#xD;
"Let me see-why, here's one good, I know, $150-three month's&#xD;
rent. What's this? another of $100. Why, d-n it, Joe, you scamp,&#xD;
you got me in a cold sweat for nothing; we 're made. Hurrah ! Yes,&#xD;
here's another,. $50; all three are on good, paying men; $25, $33,&#xD;
$17, $12. O, curse these small dribs on poor carmen or washer-&#xD;
women.   ff, off, and collect the three first; I'll lock up until you return.&#xD;
Give three light raps on the door ; I'll have our baggage ready for a&#xD;
start, and we 'l give our creditors and lady loves a holiday. Come,&#xD;
Joey stir your stumps, my boy, no time to be lost."&#xD;
Well, hold on, I must change my togs ; I must look business like,&#xD;
as the old man says ; I must Jouk as unlike, and act as unlike a gen-&#xD;
tleman as possible, upon a dunning tour. Your coat, Fred, that's it;&#xD;

"0, you dc it up brown ; quite the air and grae&amp;amp;of a collector cS&#xD;

one at the farthest, for if I should be visited this morning by Jule's&#xD;
father, big brothers, or their legal adviser, or that hot-headed southern-&#xD;
er, whose mug, you see there, is no sample of ' humility and mild&#xD;
behavior,' as the.man in the play says, I 'm booked for the season : a&#xD;
suit of apartments in 'Eldridge street,' or the Egyptian Halls. Talk-&#xD;
ing of the play, I'm devilish sorry business calls us out of town so sud-&#xD;
denly, Joey, we shall miss a great treat. Simpson has announced&#xD;
Fanny Ellsler to-morrow night, at the Park ; the town's in a furore;&#xD;
but 0, curse luxuriesI fly quick, begone, and let's know the result,"&#xD;
said the imlpatient artist, opening the door for Joe Prog's egress.&#xD;
"I'm gone," had scarcely left Joe's lips, as he glided down stairs,&#xD;
and before the artist could close his door again, a tall, handsome, keen-&#xD;
eyed, dark visaged stranger faced the painter.&#xD;
" Good morning, sir," said the stra-nger.&#xD;
"Damnation," muttered the artist.&#xD;
"Well, have you got my portrait ready for framing and boxing?"&#xD;
"I 'in sorry to say, I have not, sir."&#xD;
"Well, sir, why not? I'm sure I've been liberal and patient, have&#xD;
I not?"&#xD;
"Entirely so, sir," returned the artist.&#xD;
"Then, sir," angrily responded the stranger; "you have acted un-&#xD;
gentlemanly. You are either a lazy, indolent fellow; or disposed to&#xD;
swindle me'."&#xD;
"Sir!" answered the artist, stepping suddenly forward to the&#xD;
stranger.&#xD;
" Where's' the portrait ?" resumed the stranger, without noticing&#xD;
the belligerent attitude of the artist. "AAh, here it is ; not a touch upon&#xD;
it since my last visit. Now, sir, as I have paid you in full for it, your&#xD;
own price, and you have assured me that an hour's work more would&#xD;
complete it, I will sit down here and see it finished at once."&#xD;
And for this purpose,'the stranger, with the self-possession of a de-&#xD;
termined man, took off his hat and gloves, placed his cane on the&#xD;
table, and sat the nearly finished portrait upon the easel of the painter.&#xD;
The coolness of this movement quite staggered the artist.&#xD;
"Why',curse your impudence!" lie at length exclaimed ; "what or&#xD;
who do you take me for? One of your servants-a plantation negro,&#xD;
or what?"&#xD;
"You are r devilish clever painter, my young friend," responded&#xD;

You are indolent and extravagant, sir, and finally will break down,&#xD;
trun off, or go to the penitentiary. Now, sir, tall to, finish my portrait&#xD;
in your very best style, and while you are at it I will give you a small&#xD;
dose of very whohesome advice."&#xD;
"D-n you and your advice ; this is my own room, sir ; if you&#xD;
do n't leave it soon on your own text, you '1 -require carrying out.&#xD;
Curse you, I never was so grossly insulted before. Go, sir!~" angrily&#xD;
ai(l the artist.&#xD;

datd the painter; time was flying ; other equally, and even wprse&#xD;
drea led visitors might drop in. Foreseeing serious trouble with the&#xD;
southerner, if the portrait was not finished, the artist knocked under.&#xD;
Sir, the fhct is, I 'm expecting visitors."&#xD;
Well, well, let them come."&#xD;
"But I do n't want them to come-bores, duns and curses of various&#xD;
uinds."&#xD;
o yes,.I understand ; very well. There now, the9door is locked,&#xD;
here 's the key, push that screen between us and the, door, so. Now&#xD;

Mechanically, the painte; very unwillingly took up his pallet and&#xD;
brushes, and applied the finishing touches skillfully to the canvas, and&#xD;
is ihe did so, the stranger sat by himi, whisperingly eulogizing the art&#xD;
and artist in a polished flow of language, that bespoke him a moan of&#xD;
education and travel, and quite won the favorable feelings of the&#xD;
painter, with whom the time passed so rapidly, and while he became&#xD;
so eigrosse(l in his work, that h heard riot the various knocks and&#xD;
eflforts to enter at his door. Uut the portrait wis now finished to the&#xD;
entire satisfaction of the stranger, who desired the artist to send it&#xD;
iunme(iately to the fl'ante maker, on Broadway. Bu Fred informed&#xD;
Lis patron that his peculiar position at that 'moment precluded tlle&#xD;
possbility of venturing into the open street at noon-day, and advised&#xD;
the stranger to send a servant or porter upon the instant and get his&#xD;
painting out of his besieged apartment.&#xD;
" Well, sir," observed the stranger, " this is a miserable state of&#xD;
afkiirs for a young iman el your talents.; you ought to be heartily&#xD;
ashamed of it."&#xD;

head and skirt of the fairy-like girl's dress, without knock or tap, i&#xD;
upon'the delighted and picturesque group came Prog.&#xD;
"Hallo! beg your pardon," he stammered, as he saw the position.&#xD;
of affairs, "however, don't be alarmed."&#xD;
" Saire ! " said the indignant musician, stepping forward to Joe&#xD;
Prog, Jr., who stood still, holding by the knob of the door. "What&#xD;
is your bis-e-ness wis me; you come sans ceremonie into my house,&#xD;
saire ? "&#xD;
"O; nothing, nothing in particular, sir," responded the imperturbable.&#xD;
"Nossing in particular ! Then, saire, open ze door once more&#xD;
again, and leave my house directly, right away ! "&#xD;
"I beg your pardon, ladies ; pardon me, miss, as I see you are.pre-&#xD;
paring for a ball, but I've a little pressing matter of business with&#xD;
you, sir, (to Mons. L.) or I should not, perhaps, have broken in so&#xD;
abruptly upon your privacy."&#xD;
" Saire, I no care what ze bis-e-ness be, ze matter tossing ; a geb-&#xD;
tleman will nevair forget his manners, no time, nevair; no, saire.&#xD;
Marie, my dear, you sall go up stairs, Madams do ze same ; we go to&#xD;
ze rehearsal right away. Now, saire," turning to young Prog, "your.&#xD;
bis-e-ness wis me?".&#xD;
"That will explain," said Joe, handing Mons. L. a bill.&#xD;
"Ah, ha! yes, you are ze son of'ze landlord, I suppose."&#xD;
* The same ; I'm a little pressed for funds to-day, Monsieur, or I&#xD;
would not have called on you for this little balance, which I hope,&#xD;
however, will not trouble you to settle off."&#xD;
"Au, mon Dieu ! I wish it was pos-e-bel, but, saire, I have not five&#xD;
dollar in ze world; I have just spend .ze last dollar for dress for my&#xD;
daughter."&#xD;
"That was your daughter, eh?  Going to a-ball ? "&#xD;
"Ah, no, Monsieur, my poor child no go to ze ball, nevair no more&#xD;
for ze amusement; she engaged at ze theater."&#xD;
"0 ho! in the new ballet, perhaps, ehI ?"&#xD;
" Oui, she make her debut wiz Madame Ellsler, to-morrow night."&#xD;
." That's a fine little girl, looks beautiful; her face ought to make&#xD;
her fortune," said Prog, Jr. "I'in sorry, however, that beauty and&#xD;
talent is so poorly rewarded now-a-days. I feel sensible of the fact in&#xD;
my own case (!) that talent and virtue are but feebly encouraged ; yet&#xD;
all that I can do for you or your daughter, I will do cheerfully," said&#xD;
the false-hearted, false-faced reprobate. " D-n me, she's as beauti-&#xD;
ful as an angel, (said he, aside,) I must see her again. Has your&#xD;
daughter had tuition in dancing? has she had practice sufficient to&#xD;
give her a position in the ballet of Mad. Ellsler ? "&#xD;
"0 yes, Monsieur, my daughter is considered ze most elegant and&#xD;
accomplished professor of ze dcnse; she lead ze ballet to-morrow&#xD;
night.&#xD;

"A, yes, Prog, that is him; Monsieur, my daughter."&#xD;
"Happy of your acquaintance, my dear," said Prog, Jr., bowing&#xD;
very gracefully to the little danseuse, whose most evil hour of life was&#xD;
this of forming an acquaintance with so abandoned and heartless a&#xD;
rake and spendthrift; but she responded with grace, and while&#xD;
adjusting her hat to accompany her father to the theater, Joe Prog&#xD;
took his leave.&#xD;
"I 'in blessed," said Joe, upon reaching the street, "if I haven't&#xD;
made a fine morning's work of it, any how ; started out on a dunning&#xD;
tour, four or five hundred dollars' worth of bills in my pocket, and not&#xD;
a red cent collected! D-n me, if I've any faculty for, collecting&#xD;
rents, that's evident. One's not in town, another s short to-day,&#xD;
another 's coming up to-morrow, a fourth 's down with the rheumatism&#xD;
and out of work, and the last turns up a gray old Frenchman, with a&#xD;
daughter pretty enough to give a fellow the horrors. But hold on, let&#xD;
me see, I've got one more screw loose; yes, here's another ticket,-&#xD;
thirty-three dollars on a baker. Egad I guess he's a trump ; who&#xD;
ever knew a baker out of the dough!  Here's at him, any way."&#xD;
-      Down toward West Broadway Joe turned his steps in quest of the&#xD;
needful; what his further philosophical reflections may have been,&#xD;
we must forego, in order to note the doings behind the curtain of what&#xD;
was the first metropolitan theater, of the present century, in America.&#xD;

re was an uncommon bustle behind the curtain ; a grand throng-&#xD;
mg :' tL wings, and crowding of the green room; a great buzzing&#xD;
of '..ices ; whisking about of skirts, an 1 frisking of coat-tails. A&#xD;
east number of. polished brass and stringed musical instruments,&#xD;
mixed up with a plentitu'ile of long hair, inustachoes, and white, elon-&#xD;
gated and bony, hands abounded in the orchestra. Every body; from&#xD;
the poni pous stage-manager down to the call boy,.seemed running ovcr&#xD;
with vitality, and redolent of starch, soap, and perfumery.  The&#xD;
emaciated ballet girls, and jaded, dissipated, and overtasked and ill-&#xD;
paid actors, all seemed imbued vith a strong dose of animation and&#xD;
cleanliness. Such a buzz, bustle, and excitement, had not possibly&#xD;
been seen beneath the dome of this only real temple of the Muses, on&#xD;
the western continent, since the debut of the great George Frederick&#xD;
Cooke, or the still greater Edmund Kean. But wherefore? Was&#xD;
another and yet greater iumpersonator of the brilliant conceptions of a&#xD;
Shakspeare, Kotzebue, Schiller, Byron, or a Paine, to appear and con-&#xD;
test tme palms, or eclipse the radiant glory and genius of the Cookes,&#xD;
Keans, Booths, Coopers, and Forests ? Oh,, no! public taste was&#xD;
sated with tragic lore and histrionic impersonations ; the poetry of&#xD;
motion, the gracefuliness of fetimale lineament, the rosy lip, the laugh-&#xD;
mg.eye, and pearly }teeth of voluptuous beauty, was now the popular&#xD;
vagary ; and with a fihlry and will that few can easily forget, the public&#xD;
f5bllowed and patronized the new card, Fanny Ellsler-doubtless one&#xD;
of the most exciting of all recorded artistes, on the light futastic toe,&#xD;
of the age.&#xD;
Ellsler was a splendid woman ; as such, nothing short of a charmed&#xD;
life could have preserved her spotless reputation ; surrounded, caressed,&#xD;
besieged, stormed, and bewildered as she was, as any mortal would&#xD;
be, by the flattery, han lation, and cunningness of art, wealth, and&#xD;
power. Of her morality and virtue, it becomes us not to discuss ; the&#xD;
greatest of human butchers, the most notorious of peace-destroyers&#xD;
and umrderers, oft become invested with the most astonishing claims&#xD;
upon hutmian symcpathy' and labdation ; but too often, alas ! time poor&#xD;
frail woman, whose misguided head, or impulsive heart, leads to folly&#xD;
an] error, becomes a target at which the vilest may level their shafts.&#xD;
The manage'--ia the way, a staid and stately stage aristocrat--.&#xD;

subordimate and friends, to see tile pet of kings, favored of u rrors,&#xD;

matic amateur-entered the precincts almost male sacred to the muse&#xD;
and genius of histrionic art and literature. No rehearsal was ever&#xD;
mote actractive ; never before was professional curiosity iore greatly&#xD;
piqued tO watch, notice, and note each movement of a renowned&#xD;
artitej and all alike, from the lowest menial to the first in command&#xD;
of th  metropolitan theater, were received and treated with that&#xD;
urbaniy an i innate courtesy, which not only lpays a generous inter-&#xD;
est at all times, but is a commodity so easily dispensed, and of such&#xD;
a productive quality, that it is worth the stu ly and toil of years to&#xD;
attain as a mere accomplishment. Ellsler, glorious, voluptuous Ells-&#xD;

God's mold of womtankin, whose poetic turmn anl ethereal move-&#xD;
ments but reminded mortals of paradise, an begot in us thoughts-&#xD;
more strange than true-that angel's visits to this mundane sphere,&#xD;
were few and tar between !&#xD;
No striking peculiarity of dress, but a suavity of her address, soon&#xD;
 won, from the attaches and gazing outsiders, a friendly recognizance&#xD;
and admiring homage, most telling an I essential to the welfare and&#xD;
peace of a reigning star, of whatever firmament-political, social,&#xD;
civic, military, or artistic.  And with a grace well becoming the&#xD;
queen of the ballet, she arranged the personal and programme of&#xD;
rehearsal.&#xD;
Oiur petite belle, Marie, of course, from the position she sustained,&#xD;
if not Iroum a personelle, a striking trait, however, that persons tar less&#xD;
observant of beauty or merited attraction, than dramatic people aro&#xD;
generally, soen caught the eye of the queen of the ballet.&#xD;
g" America?  No l Zat eye, hair, con-ten-ance. No, not America?"&#xD;
said the danseuse, patronizingly.&#xD;
"No, Madame," a swered the modest girl," I was born in France-"&#xD;
" Paris, I know, yd4? "&#xD;
"Paris, Madame," Marie replied.&#xD;
"You dance, h i? Yes, I know you dance well! "&#xD;
"So they tell me, Madame," Marie modestly responded.&#xD;
"Yeni well, I know you dance well, I see by zat figure and by zat&#xD;
eye, pretty little Mademoiselle ; you dance before, in zis te-a-tair ?&#xD;

"No, Madame, never. I shall make my debut with you."&#xD;

how. Sweet child, kiss me, so;~now de maitre Ic ballet, attei-ze-on&#xD;

And the grand rehearsal of the grand Ellsler began, with such an&#xD;
eclat as seldom, if ever, on this side of time Atlantic, occurred in a&#xD;
temple of the dramatic muses, by daylight.&#xD;

"By Jove, that's a beautiful little creature you nave there Simp-&#xD;

by somehook or crool, generally manage to get the lazy side of a&#xD;
m tropoitan manage , "she s a sylph in lightness and figure a very&#xD;
"Think so?" was the cool and careless response of the manager.&#xD;
"Egad ! I d&amp;amp;," answered the lounger. "Byth      aStso&#xD;

with the business of the house, and hence I have little or no knowl-"&#xD;
edge of theaminor arrangements of it. But I must ask Barry who&#xD;
that little beauty is.";ar&#xD;
The stage manager-by the wa    ne of the most perfect gentlemen&#xD;
of his time and profession-was qhite as remote as the proprietor from&#xD;
the genealogy or whence-coming of the youthful queen of the ballet&#xD;
u  l th w e -hadfom a careless and unimpressive report,.mixed&#xD;
p   .wit something about a poor French musician' -daughter whose&#xD;
early indication of poetic motion, had induced the parents to 'ut her&#xD;
upon thestage; the judiciousness of which, a man of such staid and&#xD;
fatherly affections and strict probity of character as the stage manager&#xD;
has exhibited, did not permit of cogently arguing.&#xD;
, te managers, directors, and even the ordinary attaches&#xD;
of a metropolitan temple of the muses, become so habituated to&#xD;
change of scene and person of the mimic stage of life, that, like&#xD;
the shop-tender who serves all customers coining in from time to time,&#xD;
the senses of the eye are only leveled speculatively, at each new comer,&#xD;
and o that any rare mental or personal development soon fails to&#xD;
attract especial observation, save as to professional sense of appli-&#xD;
cation; so, perhaps, our perfect little gem of beauty, naivette, and&#xD;
artless simplicity, Marie, might have passed her novitiate quite&#xD;
cerneom professional criticism, as far as her private history was con-&#xD;
ccane, behd tot ot er and less stoical but more vicious disposed visit-&#xD;
ants behind the curtain, taken her case into their hands, and some out&#xD;
of pure (!) regard for her morals, (!) and others with still stronger regard&#xD;
for her pecuniary welfare, (!) began advances toward their object of&#xD;
cour abod'   a   attentions. But atthe first rehearsal, Ellsler, of -&#xD;
course, absorbed all the marked attentions coeval with her great fame&#xD;
and personal formidableness, in way-of extreme womanly grace and&#xD;
beauty. Her rehearsal ended and night came.&#xD;
One blaze of glorious enthusiasm  attended the debut of the dan-&#xD;
sezrse. The house was crowded to sufication, and audience entirely&#xD;
enthusiastic, and ouryouthful heroine not only shared bouquets and other&#xD;
favors with the ballet queen, but at the end of the piece received io&#xD;
the hands of the great artiste,  a diamond ringofgr~aeat elbg a cc and cost.&#xD;

" You do ell Mauemoise lle you danse like uneO s) imdc verite.&#xD;
une bnon petite ile; I make you present ; so, that is a valuale token&#xD;
efrom the young prince, he love me when I venr mosh resemble you;&#xD;

Marie. "I tell you more com-ple-nan1s again, some time; we soon&#xD;
now be better acquaint, elm i"&#xD;
"I hope so, Madame."&#xD;
Yes, we will. What, eh, your name be?&#xD;
"tMarie, Madame.".&#xD;
:Marie! Al-; yes, beautiful; kiss me, so; now adieu," and the&#xD;
still gauze and flower-attired winner of hearts, dismissed herself in&#xD;
miniature, Marie, the belle of the ballet corps, to hastily change her&#xD;
costume for the reception of a swarm of flattery venders, sycophants,&#xD;
and critique mongers of the press, who ever hang upon the skits of&#xD;
men, women, matters, and things capable of affording them an ear or&#xD;
gracious smile fr their slavery, office, reward, or a line of fulsome&#xD;
twaddle for their loving and irksome attentions.&#xD;
Marie became the object of very especial attention to one of the&#xD;
last named class of literary privateers, a dapper man of great volu-&#xD;
bility of languageand whose insinuating address, plentitude of gay&#xD;
appayeo and   eal scholastic attainments that rendered him a ery&#xD;
acessary desideratum to the journal to which he was attached, and&#xD;
as a scandal monger, hunter of the horrible, puff and critique manu&#xD;
facturer he for a series of years, stood ht the very head and front of&#xD;
Shis profession. Flapps was forty, full; he may have been ten years&#xD;
older. but a firm and assiduous disciplinarian of the toilet corps, and&#xD;
occupying a position favorable to the elongation of life, or personal&#xD;
freshness at least, he had indulged in all luxuries conducive to self-&#xD;
enjoyment, without running any of those risks so fatal to the purses&#xD;
and reputation of men and women less acquainted with the more&#xD;
extended and intricate paths, ups and downs of cavalier life in a gay&#xD;
metropolis.&#xD;
mepos was emphatically a trump, such a philosopher and man of&#xD;
the world as you may not have the good fortune to find and study,&#xD;
often, in the course of one lifetime. It was his weakness, as lie often&#xD;
said, to love lovely women; and it was no less his pride to recount&#xD;
the  anyand chequered scenes of his love-doings, if rumor was not&#xD;
beyond all uestioni a foul-mouthed hag, Flapps had more than once&#xD;
went so far as to commit matrimony, and unpropitiously, perhaps, for&#xD;
the seasons of his connubial bliss, according to all accounts, were of&#xD;
short duration. The only real mystery about the man was his origin,&#xD;
or lodgingplace. Never, even in hicups, when men are, above all&#xD;
other times and moods, most inclined to tell all they think and know,&#xD;
was Flapps known to refer once to his nativity or his nightly resting&#xD;
mlace. Lmay be, that, like the western woodsman, he had changed&#xD;
hisspots, manners, and modes of life so often and hurriedly, that it&#xD;

MARIE LESSAIRE.&#xD;
was beyond his entire comprehension to tell,.if he was ever so much dis&#xD;
posed, the place of his birth ; an:l as to his abode, that was an extreme&#xD;
domestic luxury not recognized among the newspaporial reporting&#xD;
corps of his or even the present day. Flapps hal been over hie field so&#xD;
repeatedly, that love-making, effecting acquaintances with persons, sub-&#xD;
jects, or localities, was a science in whichhlie was as aufaUt as discuss.&#xD;
mng the mnoits of a dinner at Delmoniec's. a new piece, new face, or&#xD;
voice at the opera ; a science of rare utility to mere imixirig with the&#xD;
gay and varied world, saving,.as it does, a monstrous amount of trifling&#xD;
diplomacy; by annihilating time an I space between us and objects to&#xD;
be ol)tained.  Flapps made himself thoroughly and immediately&#xD;
acquainted with Monsieu Lessaire and his daughter, and 'under assur-&#xD;
ance of rendering them most cminent service through the p owveI'flt&#xD;
columns of his journal, which was not quite so clear to the under-&#xD;
standing of the poor musician as it might have been, it was, never-&#xD;
theless, sufficient to cement a familiar acquaintanceship, and even give&#xD;
Flapps the entree of Marie's humble and virtuous home. Marie's&#xD;
success was all that could please her parents and elate her childish&#xD;
pride and vanity-the most fatal of all passions of girlhood, or the&#xD;
-maturer years of woman. They are passions that make children&#xD;
women in their own conceits-wonen, irresistible, as they think, weak&#xD;
as straws before the wiles and loose machinations of lascivious man.&#xD;
And in this dangerous hour, Marie was destinedd to suffer a great&#xD;
deprivation, in the illness of her father, whose shattered constitution&#xD;
and (lomuestic affliction had finally terminated in paralysis ; and at the&#xD;
close of the splendid Ellsler season, Monsieur Lessaire, with his favor-&#xD;
ite violin under one arm, and his dear daughter tucked close to the&#xD;
other, left the theater, never to renew his exertions or witness again&#xD;
the varied scenes and delighted throngs within their artistic walls,&#xD;
The engagement and presents bestowed upon the petite belle of the&#xD;
ballet, who had with each succeeding night gathered strength, confi-&#xD;
deuce, and multiplied admirers, brought the im mediate pecuniary&#xD;
affairs of the musician's family to a mmore comfortable position ; but&#xD;
even this result bore severely upon the mind of the sensitive father,&#xD;
adding still another nail to his coffin, which, m the course of a few&#xD;
more weeks, lie was (oomed to fill. The departure of the ballet queen&#xD;
for new fields-of triumph, closed Marie's engagement at; the theater,&#xD;
though offered munificent inducements by Ellsler .to accoim)any her&#xD;
upon her tour over the country, the present position' of the poor girl&#xD;
precluded the .possibility of accepting. A ml1 without visible means&#xD;
of further subsistence, Marie was necessitated to forego the splendid&#xD;
temptations of her favored patron, to-stand the guardian angel $f an&#xD;
expiring parent's bedside.&#xD;
It was an inclement night, twixt the close of a long and dreary&#xD;
writer and the oper ing of a.deightful spring, the sands of time rmusi-&#xD;
cian's life ran low -. A physician to 'whomi they had made application&#xD;
&#xD;
MARIE LESSAIRE&#xD;
to attend the dying husband and father, hartbreluctantly come before&#xD;
nighttall, hurriedly left a prescription, and observed that the patient&#xD;
would either be beyond medical aid or so improved by the morning,&#xD;
as to obviate the necessity of calling again upon him that night; a&#xD;
declaration Dr. Swab was very anxious they should distinctly compre-&#xD;
hend, as he repeated it several times over, and then buttoning his coat&#xD;
about him, and putting on his hat and gloves, he bade the lonely and&#xD;
sad family good night (!) and withdrew.&#xD;
CHAPTER VI.&#xD;

DISTURBED BY TIE CALLS OP hUMANiTY-A NEW CHARACTER APPEARS-A GENTLE.&#xD;
MAN AND A SCHOLAR-CITY " Lcrous "-A FIGHT AND THE RESULT.&#xD;
The night was stormy and dark ; the high blazing fires of the luxu-&#xD;
rious parlors of the physician were certainly cozy enough to make one&#xD;
forget the sympathy due from man to man. And as Dr. Swab leaned&#xD;
back in his capacious easy chair, engaged in a social game of whist with.&#xD;
a ti select friends of the family, the ring of his office door bell grated&#xD;
harshly upon his ear. And when he heard the name of " Lessair,"&#xD;
as the Milesian servant announced it, it smote still more harshly ; an&#xD;
angry scowl crossed the countenance of the city physician.&#xD;
"Who is it with the message ?" said Dr. Swab.&#xD;
" A little ghurl, I b'lave,'sur," answered the servant.&#xD;
"0, hang it, that's that fiddler's girl. Tell her the doctor is&#xD;
engaged, and can't attend to-night; they must wait till morning, or&#xD;
find somebody else," slowly muttered the physician, as he dismissed&#xD;
the servant aid placed the card upon the table in continuation of the&#xD;
game.&#xD;
"Doctor," said a studious looking young man *ho sat at the card&#xD;
table, a witness of the game, "as you are busy, suppose I attend the&#xD;
call ; to the best of my ability, I will do so ith promptness and&#xD;
pleasure."&#xD;
"well, Conrad, you may if you wish; you young men ought to&#xD;
dive right into the thickest of 'the 'puddle' at once, while ambition&#xD;
lasts, and practice of that kind is desirable," replied the physician to&#xD;
his student.&#xD;

"No, dear, it is a French fiddler, who sent for me a few days ago,&#xD;
and having some leisure moments, I have dropped in to see him occa-&#xD;
sionally. I saw him this afternoon, and left a prescription-Oh! excuse&#xD;
me," he observed to one of the whist party, "my play ; so, I left a&#xD;
prescription. He will liardly-ah, yes, yes, your trick, sir ; you and&#xD;
your partner are getting all the honors, Mrs. L.-he will hardly live&#xD;
over the night," he continued. "I told them-my play-he would&#xD;
be better, or not require further attendance to-night, at all events,"&#xD;
said the physician.&#xD;
"Then, Conrad, I would not go," responded the haughty dame.&#xD;
"1 have chosen my profession, Mrs. Swab," said the young man,&#xD;
"with a full knowledge of its requirements ; and I hope that no instance&#xD;
may occur in which Ishall falter to attend to its call promptly, while&#xD;
or when duty ever summons me."     't&#xD;
"0, very well, sir, go; heaven sakes ! I've no particular interest in&#xD;
the matter," responded the piqued dame, "go, if you wish-there! you&#xD;
have more of the honors, Mrs. L." She continued with her game of&#xD;
cards, giving the strongest proofs in reason for the total lack of inter&#xD;
est she had in the call of humanity.&#xD;
"These young men," continued Doctor Swab, shuffling his cards,&#xD;
"are always full of sentiment and'industry, when in their novitiate;&#xD;
I remember it was the same way with me-my play, sir, if you&#xD;
please-when I first put on my medical boots; it was but to call, and&#xD;
I was off like a lamp-lighter; working for nothing and finding my-&#xD;
self; attending-my trick, ahi we'11 get a share of the honors now-&#xD;
running up alleys, into attics, and down cellars, attending poor crea-,&#xD;
tures with not a copper to buZ bread or medicine-Oh, oh ! Mrs. J.&#xD;
you are picking up; but now i'11 catch you."&#xD;
"It must have been a great bore," said one of the gents.&#xD;
"Shoeking, horrible," responded another.&#xD;
" It was," said the doctor._&#xD;
" And do such people have the assurance to call on you yet, doc-&#xD;
tor ? " asked one of the ladies.&#xD;
"Frequently, madam, ,frequently," replied the doctor; " ah ! I'll&#xD;
have you yet, Mrs. M. So."&#xD;
"1 think it bespeaks great impudence in such a class of persons,&#xD;
any how, to expect respectable physicians to waste their precious time&#xD;
in such practice," observed an elderly, sanctimonious gentleman&#xD;
gold "specs," and whose very expression bespoke that he neve&#xD;
indulged in even homeopathic doses'of the milk of human kindness,&#xD;

a.&#xD;
&#xD;
a no doubt often laid the flattering unction to his soul, that those&#xD;
whose honest poverty made lowly, would be obliged to take a second-&#xD;
class car to the realms of eternal bliss, when their life mission was&#xD;
o'er, while he and his (in the eyes of all truly noble men) ofnsive ilk,&#xD;
7        forsooth, were to be accommodated on the road to peace with gilt and&#xD;
cushioned carriages of the most modern churchly improvement and&#xD;
construction. God be praised, for such are only human fallacies.&#xD;
And so the " homily " of this recherche entertainment progressed,&#xD;
the further noticing of which we forbear, though of an every-day&#xD;
occurrence, too nauseating for t.he attention of an enlightened&#xD;
reader.&#xD;
Conrad Vinton was a young and ardent student of medicine, studying&#xD;
under Dr. Swab, a noted physician, whom long and profitable prac-&#xD;
tice had naturally enough rendered callous and cold to the calls of&#xD;
sympathy alone ; and we wish that the mere accumulation of wealth&#xD;
could qualify his very apparent apathy for. human suffering ; but this&#xD;
was not so ; the natural principles of his heart were bad, and his&#xD;
position was one no alculated to contract the hardness of his heart&#xD;
.  or the evil of his pasions, as the private diary of innumerable physi-&#xD;
cians might prove, i offered to the common eye.&#xD;
" Coiime, my little friend," said Conrad, as he encountered the&#xD;
musician's child at the door, "come, I'll go with you; is your father&#xD;
very ill ?"&#xD;
"_Yes, sir, he is dying, I fear, sir. Mother is alone, and would not&#xD;
that I should disturb the doctor, but I-I could not see my father die,&#xD;
if the doctor could save him," said the girl.&#xD;
"Well, well, do n't cry, my young friend; here, get close to me,&#xD;
it is hailing and raining, the umbrella will shelter us both. Is it far ?"&#xD;
" Not far, sir," sobbed Marie,&#xD;
" Why, what an angel-like face the girl has! " said the student to&#xD;
himself, as they came to a crossing, and the bright light of the lamps&#xD;
shone upon them. " By the gods! -I never saw the like before."&#xD;
" how old are you, my dear ?" he continued to Marie.&#xD;
"I am near my fifteenth year, sir," she replied.&#xD;
" Hello ! There's a go ! " echoed a gruff, rowdy voice, close to&#xD;
the student and Marie, as they rounded a corner near to her obscure&#xD;
dwelling.&#xD;
" There's a go ; fifteen ! Did ye hear that, Bill ?  Been hazing&#xD;
around these corners these last 'fifteen years!" the ruffian voice con-&#xD;
tinued, apparently addressing a fellow rowdy at his side.&#xD;
Conrad cast a glance over his shoulder at the two ruffians, while&#xD;
Marie, conscious that she was under the protection of a gentleman,&#xD;
clung to his arm as they hurried forward.&#xD;
" btop, you infernal villains ! " said the student, as he turned upon&#xD;
the advancing ruffians, " stop, or i'1l be the death of one of you upon&#xD;
the spot! What do you follow us for?"&#xD;

"Look a here, Mary;-yer got a regler flat, eh?3" says the second&#xD;
approaching within a few feet of Marie and her protector&#xD;
" You scoundrels, stand back ! What !\do you intend to stop our&#xD;
progress? Go on, or, by heaven, I '1l do you mortal injury," said the&#xD;
excited student.&#xD;
"0, yer will, will yer ?" answered one of the ruffians; "well&#xD;
we'11 see about that," he continued, aiming a blow with a piece of&#xD;
lead, attached to a buckskin cord known in the classic parlance of&#xD;
the city as a slung-shot, a silent, desperate weapon, of most shocking&#xD;
formidableness, carried, and used, in New York to a fearful extent&#xD;
upon the victims of petty thieves and rowdies.&#xD;
Conrad anticipated the blow by guarding it off with his closed um-&#xD;
brella, which he dropped the same moment, and with a small scalpel,&#xD;
the only weapon he chanced to have upon his person at the time, he&#xD;
smote the villain a blow that laid open his brawny arm from the&#xD;
shoulder to the elbow, as dexterously as ever surgeon dissected the&#xD;

"Murder!" shouted the, ruffian, falling down upon the slippery&#xD;
pave.&#xD;

"Yes, he has cut me all ter pieces; call the per-less, Bill, call the&#xD;

And while the ruffians exercised their cowardly lungs for the pres-&#xD;
ence of those officers of the night, never found when really wanted,&#xD;
and whose presence was rendered quite unnecessary by the courage of&#xD;
the student, Conrad hurried forward with the girl; but their steps&#xD;
were arrested by the "now up and ready " watchman of the night,&#xD;
who, despite all remonstrances and assurances to the contrary, seized&#xD;
the student and the poor girl, and hurried them to the station-house.&#xD;

THEREOF--A MEETING QUITE- UNEXPECTED-A Yous LAWxYER' FIRST CLIENT-&#xD;
TUE RELEASE-OATH OF REVENGE.&#xD;
We now return to young Joe Prog and his friend, Fred Crome, the&#xD;
artist. Joe succeeded in realizing some dough of the baker, and then&#xD;
straight bent his steps to Broadway-his friend's domicil and stud'ie&#xD;
but as he turned a corner rather suddenly, he fell slap into the hands&#xD;
F.    of a gentleman who had been on the anxious look-out for Master Joe&#xD;
for some days.&#xD;
"Oho  Grab, how are you? " said Joe, recognizing a familiar pev&#xD;
sonage with a grin and smile akin to that a burglar might enforce&#xD;
upon his ugly face, at the moment of finding himself arrested in his&#xD;
occupation by a determined watchman, with a revolver in each fists&#xD;
"how are you, old boy, devilish cool morning ; let's step down int&#xD;
Florence's here, and take a nipper, chI?' /&#xD;
"IHavn't got time, Mister Prog," was the rather dry response of&#xD;
officer Grab. "Mister Prog; got a little demand agin you, I'd like it&#xD;
attended to this morning," he surlily continued.&#xD;
"Stuck, by G-    1" said the troubled young man, sotto voce.&#xD;
"Demand ! what is it?     Who's get any demand against me&#xD;
said Joe.&#xD;
"Well, 'taint for me to tell the natur of the writ ; been in my hands&#xD;
some da s, but as I could n't find you, 1 was jist going down to couid&#xD;
this x rnin' to return the writ."&#xD;
"'Vel, just my infernal luck; it's too bad ; turfed that blasted co&#xD;
r in the very nick of time to meet this fellow. Too bad, I swear;&#xD;
said Joe, muttering to himself.&#xD;
"Grab, I'm  a case, I suppose," said he to the officer, "but I 'n&#xD;
devilish dry, let 's step down and get a drink, any how, and then --"&#xD;
Can't do it, Mister Prog; busy morning' with' me; got fou&#xD;
arrests to make by three o'clock. Got to seize an old 'omern's goods&#xD;
and chattels for rent ; got to atrest a cabman for takin' a young 'oiner&#xD;
to a bad house 'stead of takin' her home ; and then i've got to watch a&#xD;
feller suspected of running away to-day without giving a young&#xD;
'omern proper satisfaction as he promised, in a marriage scrape. O&#xD;
you see I'In busy, sir."&#xD;
"Wdl, Grab,~my boy, I won   ersist, as I see you busy, but as I&#xD;

and you'll just be good enough to step in along with me and I'll--"&#xD;
"Can 't do it, sir," answered the dogged officer.&#xD;
"Come, now, old fellow, don't be too d-  severe, all of a sudden,&#xD;
f have not been murdering, committing a burglary or forgery. Grab,&#xD;
you know I've always been liberal to you."&#xD;
"Oh, pooty well,'for matter of that; that scrape you had with the&#xD;
landlord of 'The Iawksnest,' with that party of rowdies, like to have&#xD;
been a dear job for me; somebody found out I let you off for a con-&#xD;
sideration; I got reprimanded and come mighty nigh losing my place,&#xD;
so I guess we 'll call it about square. Come, I'in in a hurry."&#xD;
"I must call on my friend and change my clothes."&#xD;
"You can 't do it; come on, sir," said the officer, with a very per-&#xD;
emptoiy touch of Joe Frog, Jr.'s, arm.&#xD;
"Grab, I must have my clothes changed, and by G  I will ! "&#xD;
"Oh, now, look here, Mister, you needn't come any of that business&#xD;
with me. Now, sir, come along or I'll give you a shame face and a&#xD;
few pulls in the bargain."   r&#xD;
"Grab, you shall repent this," said Joe, making up his mind to the&#xD;
fiet, that Broadway was not a very desirable place for a genteel young&#xD;
gentleman to have a muss with an officer of police. "I know you&#xD;
well, and PIl show you up for this!" he continued..&#xD;
"Wery well, we'll see about that, my covey, but you better not&#xD;
threaten me, just now; I know you, and before I let you go, I'll give&#xD;
you a histe !'You and I know one another pooty well," said the&#xD;
officer.&#xD;
"I know you're'a d- rascal," said Joe, as they hurried across the&#xD;
park, "that I know, and if half your acts were made public, you would&#xD;
be tarred and feathered and get'a permanent office in Sing-Sing."&#xD;
"And let inc whisper in your ear, my gentleman," slid the officer,&#xD;
with a demoniacal grin, "if it was not for your rich father and a few&#xD;
of us accommodatin' police, you'd been on the 'Island' long ago !&#xD;
You know me, now hush up." And in dogged silence the twain kept&#xD;
On their way to the far-famed Tombs.&#xD;
Joe Frog, Jr., was not so much surprised as chagrined, to find, upon&#xD;
confronting the magistrate, that a charge of outright swindling was&#xD;
preferred against him. He had bought furniture to a large amount,&#xD;
r become responsible for it, in behalf of one of his lady loves ; he&#xD;
had vouched for his standing, income, etc.; the time of payment was&#xD;
up and gone over; the furniture had been taken to parts unknown;&#xD;
Joe Frog, Jr.'s, standing in community was found to be very shaky,&#xD;
.id his income extorted from a miserly father, who now repudiated&#xD;
Joe's liabilities in toto, and spoke very cavalierly of him to boot. Joe&#xD;
found himself in an excessively tight place ; his first thought was to get&#xD;
mot, of course; the first step was to send for a friend, to hunt bail or&#xD;
goit.&#xD;
&#xD;
MARI1 LESSATIE.                   43&#xD;
The, patient Grab was still in sight. Joe beckoned several times,&#xD;
however, before the, dogged officer attended his telegraphic despatch,&#xD;
"What a' you want?" says Grab.&#xD;
"Look, you, old fellow, we can't make anything by being at log-&#xD;
gerh ea:ls; I want you to do a little business for me."&#xD;
"hamn't got time; got an arrest to make right off; that fellow I was&#xD;
to watch is gittin rea ly to make tracks, and I'in after him as soon as&#xD;
the ju lge signs your writ 'delivered,'" answered Grab.&#xD;
"But d-'it, I'll pay you for it; it won't take you but fifteen&#xD;
minutes! "&#xD;
"Well, what do you want ? "&#xD;
"I wish you to go to No.-, Broadway, -    floor; you'll find&#xD;
on the first floor a painter's sign ; knock three times lightly, and give&#xD;
the gentleman that opens the door this note.'&#xD;
Grab, although a long practiced policeman, not given to let on his.&#xD;
concern about things, smiled a cunning smile, and he read the name&#xD;
on the note to be delivered, and by way. of a small matter of profes-&#xD;
sional diplomacy, lie seemed to think he would hardly have time to&#xD;
attend to it. The Spanish dollar Joe put into his hand scarcely moved&#xD;
him, but as Joe made it two, Grab said he would try to go at once&#xD;
and after a fhw minutes' private conversation with a brother policee,&#xD;
both very merry about something, Grab left, and Joe, to kill time for&#xD;
the vacant hour between him and the 'bail' he hoped -for, accepted a&#xD;
seat in the ante-room of the judges and perused the papers.&#xD;
But less than an hour brought forth a surprise to Joe Frog, Jr. It&#xD;
was no less than the appearance of his friend Fred, accompanied b&#xD;
Grab, who, seeing Jo's surprise, said, with a sarcastic leer, "&#xD;
thought I'd just bring your friend along with me, as he's got a&#xD;
little business here, too, this morning, I thought we'd kill two bird,&#xD;
with one stone, you know !"&#xD;
" D-n you! " said Joe Prog, through his clenched teeth, as the&#xD;
proof of his own stupidity and the officer's slyness, which doe of&#xD;
course called treachery, flashed upon his mind.&#xD;
"Sir!" said the artist, addressing his friend, in a very dignified&#xD;
and severe manner, "am I indebted to you foa my appearance here?&#xD;
" AiU! " responded Joe.&#xD;
" Aye ! you!"&#xD;
"Why, Fred, I trust you don 't believe me capable of such rascality&#xD;
as that of entrapping a companion and friend?"&#xD;
"What is this before my eyes? How came this officer to my very&#xD;
door, with a signal of entrance unknown to any but you ? "  ,&#xD;
"Well, I can explain it, sir, but if you prefer it, the officer Can do&#xD;
it; he understands it better than I do."&#xD;
"I shall demand an explanation of you, sir; for the present I con-&#xD;
eider you fiofriend of mine, and I have every reason to believe you&#xD;
a false ficed as well as false hearted-"&#xD;

&#xD;
Come, come, you gentlemen must keep quiet there," said thc&#xD;
clerk, putting his head into the ante-room, interrupting the angry&#xD;
speech of the artist.&#xD;
"If you.see proper," responded Joe Prog, Jr., " you may entertain&#xD;
aiy opinions you see fit; but if you utter anything derogatory to my&#xD;
character as a gentleman, and a generous one to you, sir, I shall resent&#xD;
it personally ! "&#xD;
"Come, come, now, you fellers keep quiet in here," observed Grab,&#xD;
inter)osingly.&#xD;
"Scoundrelly act, d-n him! " muttered the artist, as he paced to&#xD;
and fro in the little apartment.&#xD;
"You lie, sirw! "vas Joe's echo.&#xD;
" A int you going to stop this?" said Grab.&#xD;
Foreseeing a suiunnary denouement to their present differences, the&#xD;
belligerents continued their dispute in savage looks, low hints and&#xD;
inuendoes, which were soon settled by Frederick Crome being called&#xD;
firth to attend a suit brought against him at the instance of a surly&#xD;
looking elderly man in behalf of his daughter, a rather prepossessing&#xD;
young lady, in full dress of silks, and cheap, gaudy jewelry and a&#xD;
deep, rich brocade veil. Plea-breach of promise, seduction, etc., a&#xD;
serious matter for the artist, when backed up to him, as it was, by a&#xD;
sturdy old father, a lately retired, rich, illiterate, honest and savage&#xD;
butcher- &#xD;
The artist waived an examination and demanded the amount of bail&#xD;
required for his appearance. Two thousand dollars was named as the&#xD;
sum. And while he attends to the adjustment of that quite important&#xD;
matter, we return to Joe Prog, Jr., who afer awhile prevailed on&#xD;
Grab to carry a note to his brother, an incipient limb of the law. The&#xD;
young lawyer came, not at all surprised to find a client in the person&#xD;
of his brother ; and it was arranged, finally, after running over the&#xD;
whole list of Joe's friends and acquaintances, all of whom, more or&#xD;
less, had suffemed in some way or other by the reckless rake and&#xD;
spendthrift, to try "the old man" again. Joe was very dubious of the&#xD;
result, but 1)o better alternative seemed to offer, so the effort was made,&#xD;
and, as Joe expected, a flat refusal on the part of the father to become&#xD;
responsible to the amount of a dollar, for any more of his son's profli-&#xD;
gacies or their consequences, accompanied by a charge  collecting a&#xD;
large sum of money that day and keeping it.&#xD;
Joe railed and stormed till he was carried to an  ner room of the&#xD;
Tnmhs, by the officers, but finally becoming  Wified. lie stated the&#xD;
faces of his collecting tour to his brother, c marged his father with&#xD;
atrociQus attempts to crush him, and swore  ost deep and deadly&#xD;
revenge.&#xD;
"here, Will," said he to his brother, "I iave thirty dollars, lend&#xD;
me or borrow me twenty more'; I'll give,-you the address of a man&#xD;
who makes a business of bailing prisoners. My baiHis one thousand&#xD;

God's sake do not let me stay here an hour longer than you can pre-&#xD;
vent; go, that is a good fellow."&#xD;
"I hope," said the brother, "you will let this be the last of your&#xD;
nonsense, Joe, and a thorough warning."&#xD;
"Well, no preaching now; I venture to say it will be a warning to&#xD;
one heartless, miserlycurse, at all events," answered Joe, as his&#xD;
brother departed on his disagreeable but professional errand.&#xD;
" Anything.going on very rich this morning?" inquired an already&#xD;
partly described gentleman, putting his face close to the record upon&#xD;
which the clerk of the-court was inscribing the events of the day.&#xD;
"No, nothing very special," answered that functionary,; "we have&#xD;
had a few cases that promise pretty well, I think."&#xD;
" Ah, what are they? " responded the reporter.&#xD;
"Oh, one of our city bloods has been furnishing a palace up town&#xD;
for one of his mistresses; she's broke up, run off with the furniture,&#xD;
and he's not exactly as able as he let on to be to fork up for the goods&#xD;
and chattels, so they arrest him for swindling."&#xD;
"has there been a hearing ? " asked the excited reporter."&#xD;
," No, he waives an examination and is going to enter it up for trial."&#xD;
"What is the other case ?" says the reporter.&#xD;
"Oh, that is going to be rich ; you know Fred Cromeo?"&#xD;
"What is Fred uphere for ?" responded the reporter.&#xD;
"Breach of promise, seduction, bastardy, and all that," said the&#xD;
smiling clerk.&#xD;
"No!" you don't tell me that in candor?"&#xD;
" Fact, sir ; old Brown's daughter, Julia, you know her ; used to cut&#xD;
such a figure at the Taminany balls last winter?"&#xD;
"The deuce you say!" responded the reported. "Yes, P know her;&#xD;
kind of had a notion once to piclkher up myself. The old man'a&#xD;
wealthy !&#xD;
"Yes, but Jule has always been considered a hard case," replied&#xD;
the philosophic clerk to his equally platonic friend, the reporter ; and&#xD;
while they discussed this and other equally interesting matters of law&#xD;
and gossip, the 'bail man' enters with young Frog, the lawyer in&#xD;
chrysalis; they enter Joe's apartment,; a few minutes pass, and&#xD;
the two brothers and bail man enter the private room of the magis-&#xD;
trate or judge, and presently Joe Frog, Jr,, and his brother reappear&#xD;
and are about to leave the court room .&#xD;
"IBallo! Joey, my boy, is that you ! "says the reporter.&#xD;
"Alit Flapps,.my old fellow, how do you do?  Mr. Flapps, my&#xD;
brother ; William, Mr. Flapps, assistant editor, etc., of the 'News of&#xD;

After a mutual recognition, the parties left, the court room for a&#xD;

U               "What now? in the sulks again ? "&#xD;
"In the 'sulks,' yes, well, I may be in the sulks; very good for yon&#xD;
to say 'sulks.' You know what 's the matter, sir, well enough," said&#xD;
the half sobbing, snuffing, snapping wife.&#xD;
"Look you, now, Margaret," replied Dr. Swabs, as he closed the&#xD;
center doors of the large and luxuriantly furnished apartment, "don 't&#xD;
let us repeat the dose of yesterday morning; I'm heartily sick of it;&#xD;
for God's sake let us go to bed in peace."&#xD;
".Go to bed, go, if you wish ; I want no bed to-night; I-I-I've seen&#xD;
enough to keep me, awake for a month."   An application of fines&#xD;
needle-work and cambric, to absorb this imaginary flow of tears, ftc-&#xD;
lowed this piece of elocution, ort the part of the jealous wife; bu.&#xD;
perceiving that her husband was turning a deaf ear to her piercin-&#xD;
.            eloquence by turning over the leaves of his daily diary, which a&#xD;
accompanied by a slight effort at whistling, "She wore a wreath o!&#xD;
roses," Mrs. Swabs fired up again.&#xD;
"If a man will conduct himself in such-such a-a--in such&#xD;
shameless manner in the very-very presenceof his wife and fassji&#xD;
what will lie do when he is away from home 1"&#xD;
"Come, Maggy, don 't make a fool of yourself; you are too !'&#xD;
advanced in life, and-"&#xD;
"Yes, I know you think, sir, I'm getting quite too old, and-.&#xD;
"And ought to be ashamed of such girlish freaks," continued .:&#xD;
still placid husband, without noticing the interruption.&#xD;
"Yes, sir, I understand your meaning well ; I yn' too old for y&#xD;
That impudent hussy, Miss Japonica, would suit you a great aca&#xD;
better, sir; I take your meaning, I understand your fine cowplimnen,&#xD;
and nice politeness to her," said-the enraged wife.&#xD;

"Why bless me," answered the Doctor, " you were as tull of&#xD;
compliments to the young lady, while she was present, as you could&#xD;
possibly be!"&#xD;
. "Was I-I was, eh ? Well, if I was, it was buj to keep the atten-&#xD;
tion of the company from your close and persisting familiarities with the&#xD;
impudent jade ! That is what Idic it for, you wretch."&#xD;
"Mag Swabs," said the Doctor, I do not wish to quarrel to-night;&#xD;
don 't irritate me ; let us retire and not give the servants another ex-&#xD;
hibition of the miseries of private life."&#xD;
"That Mrs. Rush, too, she's another of your especial favorites,"&#xD;
continued the wife, without paying a   attention to the amicable&#xD;
demonstrations of her husband-" I kn w her ;sly, insidious hussy,&#xD;
her poor, good natured, easy, sleepy husband don't know half of her&#xD;
pranks. Let her come into my house again, I'll-I'll-"&#xD;
" You '11 what? receive her as you do all your friends and acquaint-&#xD;
ances, with smiles and sickening profusion of politeness, and then-"&#xD;
"Then what, you wretch, what ?"&#xD;
-4 Then when they leave, make yourself contemptible in the eyes and&#xD;
ears of your family and servants, by calling those friends and visitors&#xD;
every thing that's vile and ridiculous," said the Doctor, pacing the&#xD;
apartments and munching "dessert" that still remained in voluptuous&#xD;
profusion upon the silver dishes and baskets at the side of the tables,&#xD;
as the whist party had left it.&#xD;
"'Tis false, sir, you never heard me speak disrespectful of any of&#xD;
     my friends or my acquaintances, Dr. Swabs, in your guilty, wretched,&#xD;
heartless life!" echoed Mrs. Swabs, tremulous with passion, shaking&#xD;
her finger and stamping her foot in front of her husband.&#xD;
'iGo away," he quietly responded; "go to bed ; the symptoms will&#xD;
be more favorable in the morning ; you are in a great fever now."&#xD;
"Sir, I know you; you think you can keep your heartless actions&#xD;
all quiet and secret, don 't you ; but I can fathom you, I can."&#xD;
, "Keep quiet if you will," suddenly interposed the Doctor, as a vio-&#xD;
lent pull at the bell indicated a call.&#xD;
"  would 'nt wonder now if that was some message from that impu-&#xD;
dent hussy, Japonica; let on that you were wanted to attend a patient,&#xD;
 and get you to call on her and finish your night's courtship-and com-&#xD;
plhmnentings," persisted the termagant.&#xD;
"D--n you, if I must use the epithet, which I mean from the bot-&#xD;
tom of myheart, too, will you be done ? " in a low and guttural tone&#xD;
interposed the Doctor.&#xD;
"Sir, there's a gintleman in the off-is would spake wid yee's," were&#xD;
the words following the servant's tap upon the parlor door. The Doctor&#xD;
attended the visitor in his front office, while Mirs. Swabs called in the&#xD;
4    servant to interrogate him.&#xD;
"Thomas, who's that after the Doctor ?"&#xD;

"Sure mam, an' I don't know 'em; I'd be very sorry to have the&#xD;
laste acquaintance in the world wid 'em, maim."&#xD;
" Why, who is he?"&#xD;
"He's a man wid an ugly bit of a stick, mam, a dirty big coat;&#xD;
he's one of the polees, mum."&#xD;
"A policeman? What on earth is he here for ?"&#xD;
"Margaret, dear," said Dr. Swabs,,entering the parlor as the servant&#xD;
glided out, "I am going to the station-house ; I fear Conrad has got&#xD;
into a serious difficulty."&#xD;
" Conrad! My God, what's the matter; has that girl-?"&#xD;
" I.don 't know the particulars ; the French girl is with him," said&#xD;
the Doctor, hurrying on his coat and gloves.&#xD;
"There! I knew it! I told him not to go ; that hussy has-"&#xD;
"Well, good night, there, kiss me; now go to bed, Maggy, dear, I'll&#xD;
be back, directly,".and saluting his mollified wife, the physician made&#xD;
hasty steps to the door.&#xD;
"Francis, take good care of yourself, dear, do," called the wife.&#xD;
"I will, love," responded the husband, as the servant closed 'the&#xD;
door behind him'and the policeman ; and thus fortuitous circumstances&#xD;
closed a scene of domestic treason, which, allowed to proceed, would&#xD;
have doubtless ended in a night's sobs and sighs on the one part, and&#xD;
inward bitterness, which leads but to the ossification of all tender and&#xD;
respectful sentiments that should characterize the daily intercoune be-&#xD;
tween man and wife, on the other.&#xD;
"Where is the ydung gentleman ?" said Dr. Swabs, addressing&#xD;
several policemen gathered about the stove in the station-house.&#xD;
"lie 's all tight enough," responded they.&#xD;
"Where 's the captain of the watch, or who presides here ?" asked&#xD;
the Doctor.&#xD;
"There he comes," responded one of the policemen.&#xD;
" Ahl! Doctor, how are you? rather a damp, cold -night," said a&#xD;
very burly anl nowise pleasing or temperate-looking personage,&#xD;
coming forward from a side room and extending his huge paw in&#xD;
a friendly manner.&#xD;
"Very," the Doctor replied, touching gingerly with his ungloved&#xD;
hand the tips of the captain's fingers ; "I learn you have arrested, and&#xD;
have here a young gentleman by the name of Vinton?"&#xD;
"Yes, a young feller of that name is here," answered the captain.&#xD;
"lHe cut up such skollops," he continued, "and went on 'o that we&#xD;
had to put him in a cell; he wanted to see you; so I told one of the&#xD;
men they might go if they liked, but I had my doubts about the fuller's&#xD;
knowing you, Doctor.",&#xD;
"I should like to see-him; what's lie here for ?"_&#xD;
" Smith, go fetch him up. Well, you see, Doctor, the young feller's&#xD;
been out on a spree ; I suppose, got in with one of the night-walking&#xD;
gals, and -"-&#xD;

" 'ou lie! you malicious, bloated old sot ! "exclaimed Conrad 'Yin-&#xD;
ton, as lie came forward from a rear doors in custody of a policeman.&#xD;
"Come, you d-d thieving-looking highbinder, don't begin again,"&#xD;
roared the burly captain, "or I'll fix your flint for you."&#xD;
"Conrad, be quiet; remember where you are," said the Doctor.&#xD;
"I am perfectly conscious, sir, of the vile den I'm in, but don't feel&#xD;
disposed to suffer the insult as well as the injustice and tyranny of these&#xD;
worse than thieves, burglars and ruffians," said the excited student.&#xD;
"If you say ten words more, you infernal cuss, you, I'll hand and&#xD;
foot cuff you, and put you in the cells for a week !" again bellowed&#xD;
the wrathy captain.&#xD;
"'Conrad, allow me to speak," said Dr. Swabs.&#xD;
"Certainly, sir ; you'll please excuse my excited and rather dis-&#xD;
respectful manner, Doctor, in your presence, for when you know the&#xD;
cause, you will not wonder at the eflct, sir."&#xD;
"Now, sir," said the Doctor, addressing the captain, "may I beg&#xD;
leave to know the charge preferred against this young gentleman $ "&#xD;
"Well, the rascal has been stabbing a young man. It appears ho&#xD;
was going along from the theater with a strum pet, (Conrad rose to his&#xD;
feet, choking with indignation, but Dr. S abs raised his hand and shook&#xD;
his head, which had the effect of allaying the student's temper, and the&#xD;
captain proceeded,) she recognized a young man passing them, aimd&#xD;
spoke to him; the young man stopped, an altercation followed, and&#xD;
my gentleman ie, being about half slewed, pulls out his ugly knife,&#xD;
(holding up the calpel,) and rips away at the young.feller; my mcen&#xD;
were on thespot in a moment, of course, (!) and nabs my jockey and&#xD;
the gal too, and here they are."&#xD;
"Allow me to observe, sir," said Dr. Swabs, "that I can vouch for&#xD;
the incorrectness of a material portion of your charge. This young&#xD;
man is a gentleman,,a student under rime; lives in my house ; left there&#xD;
to attend a patient of mine, about ten o'clock, this or  rather last evening.&#xD;
The patient's daughter, an honest little French girl, came for me, and&#xD;
left my house with Mr. Vinton, to return to her father, who lies dan-&#xD;
gerously ill, and it seems to me, sir, that it's a great shame to have&#xD;
d arrested her and brought her here, whatever may hare been done in&#xD;
the heat of the moment with the young man."&#xD;
"Dr. Swabs," responded the captain, adjusting his soiled shirt collar&#xD;
-    and scarf and at the same time giving a very official grunt, "I presume&#xD;
I know my duty; and, sir, I am far from doing anything not consistent&#xD;
with my duty ; it often occurs, even with those well tried and dis-&#xD;
creet (!) men, that they are mistaken and make mistakes, which, sir, I&#xD;
am very ready and willing to make right. Brown, go lit that young&#xD;
gal go home," said this, modern Fallstafl, abruptly, c sing his caucus&#xD;
speech, and addressing one of his men, and the moment the door by&#xD;
which tire captain of the watch lad entered was opened by the oflicEM&#xD;

"0! my God ! my God ! Doctor, Doctor, save me!" screamed the&#xD;
belle of the ballet, as she threw herself in the arms of Doctor Swabs.&#xD;
" Don 't be alarmed, my girl," said the Doctor , as he loosed her&#xD;
hands from his damp coat, "don't be alarmed."&#xD;
"0 Doctor, Doctor, take me home; do, dear, good, kind Doctor,&#xD;
take me home ; take me from these fearful, horrid men ! "&#xD;
"I will, my dear ; don 't be alarmed."&#xD;
"My father, my father, my poor, dear father is dying ! " sobbed the&#xD;
half-distracted girl.&#xD;
"You ought to have told us the truth at first," said the captain,&#xD;
fidgeting about, doubtless feeling quite uneasy.&#xD;
" Truth ? to you, sir, nothing is truth ; you were possessed of ,all&#xD;
that was  true, by me, as soon as we entered here," Conrad responded.&#xD;
"I don 't want your slack, sir-I 'in addressing the young girl."&#xD;
" I-I told you all, sir," sobbed Marie, "1-4 begged, I prayed, I-I&#xD;
did every thing to prevai- upon you to send me home, sir; but-but&#xD;
you used the most horrid language, the most shocking talk I-I ever&#xD;
heard. 0! take me from this Doctor, do, dor" almost screamed the&#xD;
. poor girl.                    -r&#xD;
"I will, my dear, immediately. Sir," said the Doctor to the cap-&#xD;
tain, "I will sign a bond or pledge my word for that gentleman's&#xD;
appearance in the morning at ten o'clock, and you will oblige me to&#xD;
let him accompany me."&#xD;
" Well, Doctor, I'll take your word for his appearance ; be sure he&#xD;
appears at ten, and he may leave," answered the captain.&#xD;
":I pledge my word to that efict, sir. Come, Conrad. My dear,&#xD;
take my arm and let us hurry to your father's. Conrad, you go im-&#xD;

TIE DEATH OIAMBER--SORROWFUL PANTOMIME-A HEROINE OF ROMANTIC REALITY-THE&#xD;
DOCTOR EVINCES A DISPOsITION TO MERIT THE SUSPICIOUS INUENDOES OF HIS LADY-&#xD;
THE TABLEAU-RULING PASSIONS STRONG IN DEATH.&#xD;
"hi-i-s-h !" said a voice meeting Marie and the Doctor, at the door&#xD;
of her parents' humble home.&#xD;
"Is lie dead ?" were the first words of Marie, uttered in a low, soft,&#xD;
searching tone, "is he dead ? "&#xD;
"No, Marie," answered Mad. Mignard, for it was she, "but where,&#xD;
child, have you been? Your mother is wild about you."&#xD;
"0! Mad. Mignard, my heart is breaking. I've-"&#xD;
"Be quiet, Miss; not a word of the-matter just now," said the&#xD;
Doctor, as he perceived Mad. Lessaire, haggard and death-like, ap-&#xD;
proaching from the little rear chamber.&#xD;
"My daughter," exclaimed Mad. L.&#xD;
"Mother! mother! -dear mother!" echoed the poor girl, dashing&#xD;
aside her cold wet hat and shawl, and throwing her exhausted body&#xD;
into.the-arms of her parent.&#xD;
"fHow is the patient ?" inquired the Doctor, placing his hpt and&#xD;
cane upon the piano, to divert attention from the afiecting scene&#xD;
between Marie and her mother.&#xD;
"Very low, sir," answered Mad. M. "He sleeps now, she con-&#xD;
tinued, and my husband has gone out to procure some fruit for him,&#xD;
which he desired. He has been much concerned at missing his&#xD;
r  daughter."&#xD;
"Marie," uttered a faint husky voice from the inner chamber.&#xD;
" A! he has waked; will you walk in, Doctor ?" and as Mad. M.&#xD;
led the way, followed by the Doctor, Marie rushed by them, but was&#xD;
restrained by Dr. Swabs, who, holding her by the arm, whispered in&#xD;
her ear, "Wait, my dear, a sudden-ehock to your father will produce&#xD;
his immediate death: Let your mother and her friend pass in ; seat&#xD;
yourself so that your father may see you, but keep silent."&#xD;
But as they entered the dingy room, the dying musician cast his&#xD;
sunken eyes around the group, and, seeing his dear child, he gave vent&#xD;
to an exclamation of joy, and quite overcome with the effort, he -lay&#xD;
some seconds motionless. Marie clasped her hands, and anxiously&#xD;
leaning forward, her eyes fixed upon her parent's rigid face, while her&#xD;
mother, bending over the bed, stood in the dread anticipation of the&#xD;
physician's announcement of her husband's release from the shackles&#xD;
of mortality.&#xD;

"Tie is quite low, very weak," said Dr. Swabs, feeling the almost&#xD;
pulseless wrist of the musician ; "but he will rally; do not disturb hin:&#xD;
or make any unnecessary noise. You had better retire to rest, Miss,&#xD;
said he to 'Marie, "you require sleep very much. It is now not far&#xD;
from morning; -;take rest ; your mother and this lady will attend your&#xD;
father, who will be no worse for some hours, at least ; retire ; that's a&#xD;
good girl."!&#xD;
"Willyou remain, dear loctor ? " answered the little belle, grasping&#xD;
the arm of Doctor Swabs, pon whom she now looked as the guardian&#xD;
of her father's life.&#xD;
"A short time, but will "eturn again in the morning."&#xD;
"Mother, you shall rest, I will sit with my father."&#xD;
"No, no, dear child, I am used to it; go you to bed ; do go; 'God&#xD;
bless my daughter, bon nuit," said Mad. L., embracing and kissing&#xD;
the polished, ivorylike, aid now cold features of her child.&#xD;
"Bon nuit, mon here, ckere mere. Mad. Mignard, Doctor, good&#xD;
night," and with a coup de grace that had never failed upon 'the&#xD;
boards' of the Metropolitan play-house, to bring a-quick response from&#xD;
the audience, the sad and pale sylphide glided to: rest, in a tastefully&#xD;
arranged little chamber over their equally limited parlor.&#xD;
Dr. Swabs briefly stated to the mother and  jad. M., in the most&#xD;
modified form, the cause of the detention of Marie ; in fact, however&#xD;
little-he had been surprised, had he known the conduct of the chief of&#xD;
the police station and his subordinates, lie was quite ignorant of the&#xD;
worst feature, nor will it be productive of the remotest good or even&#xD;
passing interest to the reader to hear the recital of the impious lan-&#xD;
guage and foul besotted conduct of that, potentate, to his shivering,&#xD;
terrified, and pure prisoner. As lie is dead, and gone to his final&#xD;
hearing , " it may be hoped he has been more mercifully dealt with&#xD;
than his mortal acts would give us reasonable cause to expect, and&#xD;
that his office has since beei filled by others more imbued with-hu&#xD;
manity, temperance, mental capacity and common,justice. We barely&#xD;
venture to hope so.&#xD;
The physician was cut short in a very interesting tete-a-tete with&#xD;
Mad. Mignard, upon music, the drama, ballet, etc., by the return of&#xD;
Mons.   ignard, our bon vivant acquaintance of the orchestra, whc&#xD;
had gone 'n quest of, and obtained quite a supply of fruits and con-&#xD;
fections th t the dying brother musician had requested.&#xD;
Mad. Mignard was a woman of forty, rather embonpoint, to be&#xD;
sure, but more sufficiently so to appear the more voluptuously striking&#xD;
in some men's views; her dark, full eyes and profusion of raven&#xD;
tresses, with lips and teeth of considerable poetic richness and favor,&#xD;
made her a woman, once seen not easily forgotten, even by the coldest&#xD;
observer of female'charms. With manners and habits, even the mod-&#xD;
erate circumstances of-her present life had not impaired ; she was&#xD;
lady-like, truly Parisian, winning, graceful, kind and generous. le.&#xD;

history was one of romance itself: her parents weie wealthy ; she&#xD;
was a native of St. Domingo; when the bloody insurrection of that&#xD;
island took place, Mad. M. was a child of five years old. Rescued&#xD;
and saved by a sea captain, though her parents were slaughtered, she&#xD;
was taken to England, where some ten years of her life was passed.&#xD;
Discovering, by accident, the whereabouts of an aunt, a wealthy widow,&#xD;
'a few leagues from Marseilles, she set out in a ship, commanded by&#xD;
her preserver and protector-in whose family she had so long resided-&#xD;
the St. Domingo captain. During a, long calm at sea, they were&#xD;
beset and boarded by Algerine Corsairs, plundered, vessel scuttled,&#xD;
officers and most of the crew murdered, and herself and a few other&#xD;
passengers carried away to an island inhabited or retained by these&#xD;
marauders of the sea. From this place chance set her free. An&#xD;
armed vessel of the Danish navy, by accident, touched at the island,&#xD;
at a time when most of the pirates were at sea; those remaining not&#xD;
choosing to betray their murderous calling, quietly submitted to the&#xD;
departure of Marguerite and her three friends, an Englishman, his&#xD;
wire, and an old French gentleman, formerly an officer i the French&#xD;
army. Two months on board of the Danish war ship so wrought&#xD;
upon the heart of the young commander, who spoke both English and&#xD;
French with the utmost fluency, that he tendered, the voluptuous brut&#xD;
nette a cabin passage for life, half of his berth, and an equal claim&#xD;
.  upon his heart, hand and purse. He was not to be rejected. Young,&#xD;
brave, high in command and noble in person, she yielded, the next&#xD;
port she arrived -at, and they were duly married ;, and shortly after-&#xD;
wards the vessel reached home; the lady still importunate to visit&#xD;
4       rai ce, set out thither, with ier husband, and they had scarcely&#xD;
reached Marseilles, when the Danish captain was taken. ill and died.&#xD;
Marguerite was a widow---a young, beautiful, dashing widow. Find-&#xD;
ing her wealthy relation, she took up her abode with her, and soon&#xD;
after, attracting the attention of a gay young Parisian at Marseilles,&#xD;
upon business connected with the house of his father, a rich banker in&#xD;
the French capitol, a short courtship, and they were married. The aunt&#xD;
died and left Marguerite a handsome dower. Her husband in course of&#xD;
a few years taking to his cups and bottles, gaming and other vices of the&#xD;
capitol, soon squandered all their moneys and estates, and in a fit of.&#xD;
horrors committed suicide one morning by an early plunge into the&#xD;
muddy and deep Seine. Yet young and handsome, without encum-&#xD;
brances, poor and no resources, it required of her but a short miedita-&#xD;
tion to accept the protection of a rich musical directeur of an opera&#xD;
house that she had frequented. This liason lasted. much longer than&#xD;
the good treatment of the old roue warranted, but Marguerite had no&#xD;
choice; she lived, endured and hoped on. The directeur loved her-&#xD;
was proud of her; she was his idol, and when the fit was on, he lavished&#xD;
upon her all, that money and voluptuous taste could well obtain in the&#xD;
gay city.- But he was brutal and fretful, and the finale was, that a&#xD;

MARIE LESSAiRES&#xD;
&#xD;
young musician, frequently visiting the house upon business with the&#xD;
directeur, caught her eye; her heart was vacant., and the young Froneh-&#xD;
man, with twenty francs in his pocket, and the beautiful woman under&#xD;
his arm, made a very sudden appearance, one day, in London. Mar-&#xD;
guerite and the young musician, Mignard, lived in happy independ-&#xD;
ence in the great'city, for three years,.when with a prospect of bettering&#xD;
his fortune, Mons. Mignard and Marguerite sailed for the new world.&#xD;
Such a woman, with a man of Doctor Swabs' temperament, as set&#xD;
forth and accredited by his lady, could'not fail to receive from. him&#xD;
more than a passing notice; therefore not the least strange to say, the&#xD;
physician remained with his humble patient much longer than he had&#xD;
previously purposed.&#xD;
A sudden knock at the door aroused the little conversational party&#xD;
at the sick musician's bedside. Conrad Vinton and Doctor Swabs'&#xD;
servant were at the door in the Doctor's gig ; there were calls for the&#xD;
Doctor at home, and Conrad, more than. anxious to supply his pre.&#xD;
ceptor's place, in this instance, though attended as it was in the onset&#xD;
by the very serious difficulties of the night, signified his willingness to&#xD;
remain.&#xD;
"Oh ! no necessity of that, sir ; the patient is easy ; he requires&#xD;
\ Rothing but quiet," skid Dr. Swabs ; "you might as well return with&#xD;
\m, Conrad ; the man will need nothing but what his friends here can&#xD;
give him; he may last until noon or sunset to-morrow ; then, if attend-&#xD;
ance be required, we can be called."&#xD;
"I would as lief remain, sir," responded the student, as he gazed&#xD;
at the sinking features of Mons. Lessaire.&#xD;
"Oh I do remain with us until daylight, at least," beseechingly said&#xD;
Mad. L.&#xD;
"Well, be it as you please," the Doctor replied, and in a half whis-&#xD;
per he reminded Conrad that they were to be at the police office at ,&#xD;
nine, A. M.&#xD;
"I will be punctual, sir, to the appointment," observed the student,&#xD;
divesting himself of his cloak and gloves, while the Doctor, accompa-&#xD;
nied by Mad. Mignard, stepped towards the front door; they halted&#xD;
for a moment in the little hall, a few indistinct words were exchanged,.&#xD;
and the Doctor passed out into his gig and rolled off towards home,&#xD;
muttering-in the folds of his ample coat, "Charming woman t Curse&#xD;
that sticking plaster~of a fellow, with his innocent face and draughts&#xD;
of sentimental nonsense ; just the very dolt that some women fancy ;&#xD;
however, I'll see her again."  Reaching his house, Dr. Swabs ran&#xD;
over the "calls" made during his absence, sorted out such as he&#xD;
deemed most necessary to see at once, rubbed out the others, jumped&#xD;
into his gig again and began his morning rounds.&#xD;
The faint streaks of day were beginning to pencil their varied colored&#xD;
and irregular angles upon the eastern heavens; the chamber in which&#xD;
death was about to hold court and set his seals, was still; the worn&#xD;
&#xD;

out wife of the dying dan had thrown her face upon a small work-&#xD;
stand before her, and was enjoying that brief respite the dormant and&#xD;
' overtasked brain permits the wretched in the gloomiest hours of exist-&#xD;
ence. Mignard and his wife had just left by the acquiescence of the&#xD;
student, and he alone now kept the quiet vigil; a rustling movement&#xD;
of tlge bed-clothes disturbed Conrad from the contemplation of a hand-&#xD;
somely executed crayon sketch ofthe "Belle of the ballet," by a young&#xD;
artist of the theater, and which hung over the fire-place. Conrad&#xD;
turned his face towards the bed ; the old musician was sitting upright,&#xD;
his eyes glassy, sunken, and almost terrible to look upon. Ife glanced&#xD;
at the young man a searching stare, then gazed around the room,&#xD;
which the nearly burnt-out lamp, and yet feeble light of early morn,&#xD;
rendered the recognition of minor objects very problematical; for a&#xD;
moment the dying man's eyes rested upon his dozing wife, a sigh.&#xD;
escaped him, and he then continued his gaze, which at length fixed&#xD;
upon a corner near the chamber door; and almost unconscionably the&#xD;
gaze of the student followed the eye-wanderings of the old man until.&#xD;
he perceived a box, a black oblong box, in the corner. The musician-&#xD;
perceivig the student had seen the object of his search, essayed to&#xD;
speak, but the effort failed him, and he could only give his hand and&#xD;
head a significant beck and nod towards the black box, which Conrad&#xD;
interpreting it noiselessly, discovered .and took from it an old and&#xD;
much worn violin.                )&#xD;
" Ah ! ha! ye-yes, zat is him, give-give-me," articulated the&#xD;
old man with a dying effort.&#xD;
Mad. Lessaire awoke; she rubbed her eyes, and in wonder gazed at&#xD;
the scene before her. The student still held the old violin and bow in&#xD;
his hands. Mad. L. was the first to interrupt this curious pantomime-&#xD;
rushing to her husband, she cried-&#xD;
"Non Dieu! Mon Dieu! Father! Husband!"&#xD;
"Ahu! give me, gi-give me-violin; go call Marie, quick, run&#xD;
right a--a-a vay I-I'm called for-for ze rehearsal, Marie, be-hin,&#xD;
Ma-" and with a nervous grasp of the violin from the hands ci the&#xD;
student, as he stood speechless over the bed, the poor old man gave the&#xD;
bow one twitch across the instrument, "the bridge" of the violinturne.l&#xD;
over with a clash and snap, the musician fell back upon his pillow.&#xD;
dead!&#xD;
The scene going forward below s irs had awakened Marie; she&#xD;
descended in haste and entered the chamber of death just in time to&#xD;
hear the last broken syllable uttered by her parent; and in the next&#xD;
moment the soul of the musician had winged its Way to attend the&#xD;
_1 ' rehearsals of immortals, while the daughter's inanimate form, after a&#xD;
piercing shriek, lay stretched upon his cold, cold clay.  *  *&#xD;

PHILOSOPHY AND PHYSI--A SENTIMENTAL STUDENT AND A CASE-HARDENED DOCTOR-A&#xD;
RIDE TO THE STION-HOUSE-A STREET SCENE--AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE TURNS UP-&#xD;
THE AVENGER FOILED-TE ARREST-TIIE RECOGNITION-TIIE ROUE IN THE House&#xD;
OF MOURNING.&#xD;
"Well, Conrad, I've been waiting for you. Why, you look quite&#xD;
fagged out. how is the old fiddler?"&#xD;
" Dead," solemnly responded the student.&#xD;
"I supposed he would go off this morning," continued Dr. Swabs.&#xD;
"Well, now we must go and attend to that infernal police afihir; this&#xD;
comes, my dear sir, of your excessive desire for attending all 'calls.'&#xD;
I' always know, sir, when and where a call is absolutely necessary,&#xD;
or where one will at least pay best ; for, after all, of course, it is a&#xD;
business matter purely, and physicians can not profit in trading and&#xD;
trafficking in sympathy ; though we necessarily must manufacture and&#xD;
keep on hand a decent supply,-to use as circumstances may warrant,&#xD;
yet that must not interfere with our book-keeping or settling of ac-&#xD;
counts," said the learned and experienced practitioner.&#xD;
"I hope I may never, through mere professional practice, take that&#xD;
view of our profession," answered Conrad. "I look upon the pro-&#xD;
fession of physic, sir, as the noblest study of man; when backed by&#xD;
skill, courage, and humanity, the office is sacred, and in which the&#xD;
man, in fulfilling his duties faithfully and humanely, becomes allied to&#xD;
ministering immortals themselves! "&#xD;
"Yes, yes, all very well," said Dr. Swabs, putting on his overcoat&#xD;
and preparing for their drive to the police station ; I've been all over&#xD;
that ground, asyou must know, but it wou t pay, sir, for the pains and&#xD;
labor of lifeaig college, the long, long hours of study, the expenditures&#xD;
in way of f  ad awards to professorships,-and the patient boring&#xD;
re endur. 41ng, waiting, waiting for pay ing practice. IIowever.&#xD;
you must .       e, and I can not blame you Conrad, for being&#xD;
iiidustiiisY among those willing to allow young practitioners to learn."&#xD;
rIshilknjver, sir,/experiment upon even the humble," said the&#xD;
student,"hta'litte nettled at the Doctor's remarks. "I trust I may&#xD;
always have the approving consciousness of practicing only when and&#xD;
where the patient's especial good sienw to call for my attention and&#xD;
exertions, and never enter into tie depths of mere theoretical practice,&#xD;
under the dangerous plea of benefiting science at the expense and&#xD;
misery of a fellow-creature, at my mercy, through the providence of&#xD;
God."_&#xD;

Excellent, i' faith. You'd have made a better divine, I thiik&#xD;
M r Jear sir, than a physician," responded Doctor Swabs, as he ad&#xD;
his hilosophizing student stepped into the gig and drove off to the&#xD;
poiae office. "But you will be traveling over all that tender-heartea&#xD;
mor hty before vou nett your first thousand dollar fee, my dear sir?&#xD;
"May be so," said the student solemnly; then proceeding, he Qb&#xD;
" served, "Doctor, I trust it may not be my fate to witness ('any such&#xD;
scenes like that I witnessed this morning."&#xD;
"What, at the old Frenchman's ? "&#xD;
.s      "Yes, s ir."&#xD;
"Did they go on so much   I suppose the old fellow died rattier&#xD;
quietly; he was too low to  ake much ado himself."&#xD;
"In all your practice, sir, continued the student, I doubt it a c e&#xD;
so really touching and iuipi'cssive ever cane, to your direct know-&#xD;
ledge."&#xD;
" Oh ! bless you, yes, Hiundreds of them," answered the Doctor.&#xD;
"Why, sir, I have been present at the leath of over jive hundid,&#xD;
persons, under all manner of circumstances, causes, and effects;csk e&#xD;
closing scenes of patients beyond my skill, I used to endeavor }o&#xD;
avoid, but I got over that; nd like these fellows here at the stati-.&#xD;
house, one finally gets o taniliar with human misery and sueim&#xD;
tears and wailings, that we fail to be impressed w*ith, any .plase 9.&#xD;
physical evil or inental sorrow. But here we are. to answer for 3; r&#xD;
anatomical demonstration upon , the live subject last might; yopr&#xD;
version of the story, by the way, Conrad, I have not yet learned."&#xD;
And the student, in the interim of the appearance of the captain of&#xD;
the watch, related the ihcts of the case;. at the conclusion of wliigh,&#xD;
that worthy came in, and saluting Dr. Swabs very courteously, '-i.&#xD;
formed hu that the, person who had .been stabbed by his stuidet&#xD;
turned out to be a notorious rowdy of the city; and, having a previgqu&#xD;
matter to settle with the police court, had not again made his appear-&#xD;
ance, so the case wa~s closed, or would be, upon the young man paying&#xD;
certain fees.&#xD;
To this Conrad demurred; but, after a brief and exciting debate,&#xD;
in which the student spoke his mind right freely to the 'captain,' Dr.&#xD;
Swabs convinced his pupil, that in no place could,Slhakspeare's wards&#xD;
better apply, under any and all circumstances, tian to a watch-ie&#xD;
of a ponce court of a great city-"Discretion is the better part of valor"&#xD;
Reluctantly the student drew'forth his purse and paid the fee, and left&#xD;
the.scene of his first act in the drama of lit iin a nietroplis.&#xD;
As'the Doctor and Conrad drove down town, a large mob of p&#xD;
ions attracted their attention at the' corner of one of the principal&#xD;
tribntaries of Broadway, and they stopped the vehicle for a moment&#xD;
ato learn the nature of&amp;amp; the difficulty.J.&#xD;
S"A. !'said Dr: Sxabs, "I kiow that yung man ; he is the, sqn&#xD;

Alight; hold the reins, Conrad, sit still," and the physician stepped&#xD;
:rom the vehicle just in time to witness a savage blow from the hand&#xD;
p1 a man, who, from cause presently explained, dealt it.&#xD;
"lie is killed!" shouted one.&#xD;
" Who is he?" echoed others.&#xD;
"I am the man,! "said the person who struck the prostrate victim,&#xD;
"I am the marn; if he is not dead, I have work yet to do."&#xD;
"Seize the assassin! secure him! "&#xD;
"Where's the police?" cried the gathering mob, which just then&#xD;
yielding to the pressure and authority of two stalwart officers of justice,&#xD;
fell back, while the assailant, without resistance, suffered himself to be&#xD;
arrested.&#xD;
"Gentlemen," said the prisoner, "I willingly surrender to justice;&#xD;
and why I have committed this act, I ought to offer to the witnesses&#xD;
of it some reasonable cause. Less than a year ago, that scoundrel&#xD;
fed this city, a fugitive from justice, a forger and a villain; .he swin-&#xD;
died his father and robbed me of my wife ! I have traced him from  '&#xD;
lace to place, from north to south ; my cause was more eager than /&#xD;
justice, an eye more keen than that of Argus. I met him here; ;&#xD;
demanded reparation as a man; he denied me; I-then gave him just-&#xD;
e, retributive justice ! Am I right ? "&#xD;
" Good for him! hooraw !" shouted the mob, as the officers led the;&#xD;
prisoner off towards the Tombs. But they had not proceeded far be.&#xD;
re one officer was deemed quite sufficient to lead the prisoner to jail,&#xD;
while the other retraced his steps to pay a little attention to the sup-&#xD;
posed assassinated man.&#xD;
Dr. Swabs had the injured man conveyed into a store, and by such&#xD;
medies as the case then required, brought the man to consciousness.&#xD;
e gazed around among the spectators who had rushed into the store,&#xD;
and dropping his head the moment he met the well-known connte-&#xD;
rance of the physician--&#xD;
' Dr. Swabs," he said in a feeble and surprised tone.&#xD;
' Mr. Frog, is it possible?" the Doctor exclaimed.&#xD;
"Then he comes under my care," said the policeman.&#xD;
"Who are you, i? "responded Joe Prog, Jr., arising from his torpor-&#xD;
"Oh, an old fritd, look at me; seen&#xD;
" I know you; curse and d-n you," .said the surviv"g, but still&#xD;
nervous and weak profligate.. "Doctor, please have me removed from&#xD;
this," he continued.&#xD;
"'My carriage is at the door," replied the Doctor.&#xD;
"lie goes with me, sir," said the officer ; he is a fugitiveifrom just-&#xD;
ice. I have a warrant for his arrest in my pocket."&#xD;
;' For what ? " asked Joe Frog, Jr., raising himself by aid of the&#xD;
physician, and taking a chair.&#xD;
"For forgery !" answered the officer; forgery upon your father,&#xD;
aid then clearing out."&#xD;

"It is hardly necessary to explain that matter here, in the midst&#xD;
of a mob," said the Doctor ; "but, sir, that affair has all been settled&#xD;
I think."&#xD;
"yes, it has, long ago," answered Joe Frog.&#xD;
"Well, I've got no orders to act, further than to keep a look-out for&#xD;
you,"the officer replied. "You 've always been a customer of mine&#xD;
Mister Prog, you know, and I'1l use you as well as I can, ; but here'&#xD;
a warrant for your arrest; I've had it some time ; so you must gg'&#xD;
with me."&#xD;
Joe Prog finding it useless to resist or dally with his old and intimate&#xD;
acquaintance Grab, yielded the point, only requesting Dr. Swabs to&#xD;
accompany them to the police office. A carriage was sent for, in&#xD;
which the officer, Joe Frog, and the Doctor started for the Tombs,&#xD;
Conrad following in the Doctor's gig. The case was soon settled;&#xD;
Josiah Frog, Jr., was held to bail in the sum of two thousand dollars,&#xD;
to appear and answer a charge of forgery, preferred by Josiah Prog,&#xD;
Sr. Dr. Swabs at once offered himself and was accepted as bonds-&#xD;
man; and the magnificently attired, moustached, and imperialed roue&#xD;
was again at large, scarcely the worse from the blow he had received&#xD;
from a heavy mace, with which his assailant had leveled him, but&#xD;
a few minutes before, upon the side walk of the most fashionable&#xD;
irottoir.&#xD;
"Josey," said Dr. Swabs, as soon as the matter was disposed of,&#xD;
"have you seen any 6f the family? how long have you been in the&#xD;
city?"&#xD;
"Five days," answered Joe;- "I was afraid to show myself, Doe.,&#xD;
the d-d hounds were after me; I knew the afihir of mine and the&#xD;
old man's was all hushed up, but there are other scrapes I got into,&#xD;
and curse them, at last I determined to dress and come out of my hole&#xD;
in broad daylight, and it was my cursed luck to put myself right in&#xD;
the way of the very wretches I should have avoided. Its my luck."&#xD;
"Well, you get into the gig with my student, Mr. Vinton, Mr.&#xD;
Frog," said the Doctor, introducing Joe as he pushed him into the&#xD;
vehicle with Conrad. "Now, Mr. Vinton, please drive directly home;&#xD;
I hate a call to make close by. I have news and a long talk with&#xD;
you, Mr. Frog ; Mr. Vinton will show you to a room; take rest and&#xD;
wait until I return."&#xD;
Joe Frog asked the privilege of driving, the vehicle, lie being a&#xD;
little anxious, for the present, to escape further street emeutes, bya&#xD;
choosing the less public and crowded avenues of the city, and, in doing&#xD;
so, he passed directly by the door of a dv|lling Conrad was so anxious"&#xD;
to revisit as to touch the reins and stop the horse.&#xD;
"I wish to alight here for a few moments, sir-wait a moment; if&#xD;
you lease."&#xD;
"Why! yes, bless me a- I know this place," said Joe.&#xD;
"Are you acquainted hero?" Conrad inquired.&#xD;

"Be quiet as possaoe, sir, the poor man is dead," said Conrad.&#xD;

" Ilish-e-e!'" echoed the student--" they are performing the last sad&#xD;

"Stay, Doctor, 0 I at. glad you 'are bere," exclaimed Marie, as she&#xD;
rushed forward and caught Conrad's arm-"stay."&#xD;
"By the Lord, she 's lovelier than ever ! " musingly uttered Joe&#xD;

" Mr. Frog, Miss Mari," said the student, presenting Joe.&#xD;
Al, yes, we are acquainted, I believe ; Mr. Prog has visited na&#xD;
before," answered Marie.&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Marie, but you are grown so beautiful and-"&#xD;
A low but such a sorrowful look as the belle of the ballet gave the&#xD;
profligate, forestalling his heartless compliment, and recurring to the&#xD;
pressing mattrs then on the mind of the po r girl. caused Joe to.&#xD;
take the seat presented by the student and become silent.&#xD;

"0 yes, of course they raised a beautiful hubbub when they found&#xD;
I was gone," said Joe Pro  Jr., as he and. Dr. Swabs sat in the pri-&#xD;
vate office, after Joe and  onrad had got home from Lessaire's.&#xD;
But curse them, Doc., did they think I was foolish enough to go&#xD;
to.the expense of shooting myself, or take a cheap and vulgar way to&#xD;
kingdom-come by a deep ive into the Iun ison ?&#xD;
"I assure you, Josey," replie. the Doctor, "they were in great&#xD;
anxiety about you. William, your brother, said you had acted very&#xD;
strange, and1 left him very uncereimtoniously, and would not wonder if&#xD;

&#xD;
the refusal of your father to countenance or assist you, had driven you&#xD;
to some desperate act. The friends of the family were called together&#xD;
-your sisters were in hysterics-I was called for and consulted."&#xD;
"Well, what did you think abou; the matter, Doc I "&#xD;
"I ventured to say, that knowing your temperament from infancy&#xD;
up,'Josey, I had no fears of your undertaking personal violence upon&#xD;
r   yourself."&#xD;
"Exactly, when so many were taking the labor of that upon them-&#xD;
selves," said Joe.&#xD;
"So I thought, and hence I was fully prepared for the shock some&#xD;
of your Imily were $o astounded at, when they learned that you had&#xD;
made so free with the banking privilege of your father."&#xD;
"And the old man ?"&#xD;
"0, you may fancy how he went on ; got perfectly furious, swore&#xD;
roundly that he would have youi pursued, arrested and punished to the&#xD;
full extent of the lav. IIa! ha! I laughed in my sleeve at the ideal'&#xD;
said the Doctor, "for although; Josey, I knew you were beyond grace&#xD;
long ago, yet I was well aware the family pride would be obliged to&#xD;
keep any of its members from public disgrace, however great you&#xD;
might tax them."&#xD;
"Doctor Swabs," said Joe, touching the knee of that personage, "1&#xD;
am qute sensible of the many acts of indiscretion and folly I have&#xD;
committed ; and were I standing upon the scaffold to-morrow, I would&#xD;
charge the whole account of my folly, and crime, should I ever com-&#xD;
mit any, to my father ! "&#xD;
"Josey, Josey," interposed the Doctor, shaking his learned head.&#xD;
" I mean it, , and I need .not 'go far for proof of the fact, when one&#xD;
who knows him so long and well as you do, is present," continued the&#xD;
now quite serious rake.&#xD;
"1 know the old gentleman has-his faults, certainly, Josey, but yob&#xD;
must always manage to keep up the respect and dignity of your family,&#xD;
sir.&#xD;
"Even if I lie through thick and thin:to do'it, ch ?"&#xD;
The Doctor gave his head an affirmative shake.&#xD;
bThat I have done, Doc., for years. I have lied to cover the old&#xD;
man's meanness ;, I have sworii to very doubtful matters to save hint&#xD;
a dollar. I have tried to study and practice-by his ,own +persuasion&#xD;
-4l:-the mean and dishonest points 'of his own ebaracter until&#xD;
ie keiled: f it; and. disgusted at his ingratitude, Pharisaicalness and&#xD;
fiiserable meanness, by heavens, I wonder how I ever stopped .this&#xD;
side of the penitentiary!"&#xD;
- IIai! ha' Jodey, you di riot stop far short 16f it, when you forged&#xD;
iand presented that draft upon your father's banl ers for solarge a sum'&#xD;
"Beg your pardon, sir, I did not!present it, nor could any proof&#xD;

old Joe Prog himself has been caught in some very dirty transactions,&#xD;
let me tell you," said the son.&#xD;
"Come, come, sir, don't talk so; I have called you here for th6&#xD;
purpose of having a talk in reason, and proposing a reconciliation&#xD;
between you and your family."&#xD;
"Doctor, I don't care that for them!" said Joe, snapping his fingers.&#xD;
"They have treated me contemptuously, for three years past, and now&#xD;
I hurl it back to them with full interest; above their petty favors, I&#xD;
despise them. As to the old man, I hate him; shall avoid and hate&#xD;
him as the deadliest enemy I have, as long as he lives."&#xD;
"All folly, my dear sir; you must keep a civil tongue in your head ;&#xD;
you must use a little diplomacy; there is a fee pending, you know,&#xD;
well worth attending to; you are young, and will presently see the&#xD;
error of your way."&#xD;
"0, fudge, Doc., come, no preaching; if we are to have much more&#xD;
argument, let it be on some agreeable matter, and just let me twitch&#xD;
the bell and order up a bottle of your Otard, my old boy."&#xD;
"Of course, if you wish it," said the Doctor, agitating the tassel.&#xD;
"But let us be serious ; I hope to see you settled, sir, married to one&#xD;
of the many respectable, talented and eligible young ladies I could&#xD;
name to you, master Joe."&#xD;
"Yes," thought Joe, "old fellow, you have two or three of your&#xD;
own tribe in the matrimonial shambles, hence the milk in the cocoa&#xD;
nut!"&#xD;
And Joe was right. The Doctor, not so much despairing of young&#xD;
Prog's reformation, as he felt anxious for the handsome settlement of&#xD;
one or three Miss Swabs, thought it fortuitous that he had fallen in&#xD;
with the young man, even through the curious circumstances under&#xD;
which they met, and therefore endeavored to bring around certain&#xD;
delicate matters, as scientifically as possible ; all to no purpose, how-&#xD;
ever, for Joe Prog, Jr., had a story to tell, which quite upset all the&#xD;
family plans Dr. Swabs had then fomenting in his brain.&#xD;
"Doctor," said Joe, filling a glass with the fluid the servant had&#xD;
uncorked and placed upon the table-" You can step out for the&#xD;
present," he observed to the servant. "Doctor, I'm going to tell you&#xD;
a secret ; fill your glass-my respects ;" the Doctor touched glasses---&#xD;
"I'm married!"&#xD;
"Pshaw! you married?" echoed the Doctor with unpleasant surprise.&#xD;
"I am married to the handsomest lady you have seen for a season,&#xD;
I guarantee."&#xD;
"Young and beautiful, eh ?"&#xD;
"Well, no, not so devilish young, that's a fact ; but then, Doctor,&#xD;
my boy, she's got the rocks, loads of them!"&#xD;
"Why, you 've made quick work of it-where and how did this&#xD;
affair come about?" inquired the Doctor, drawing his chair close to&#xD;
Prog, Jr., and who being an old amateur in intrigues and their excit&#xD;
&#xD;

Yng intricacies, felt a sort of desire to learn the particulars of the young&#xD;
roue's present case.&#xD;
"I'll tell you, Doc.," said Joe, filling and turning off another glass&#xD;
of the physician's elixir vitae, and I do it in the strictest confidence,&#xD;
sir."&#xD;
"Certainly, sir," responded the Doctor.&#xD;
''When I heard of the old man's determination to abandon me to my&#xD;
fate, situated as I was that morning, and his charge, also, of swindling&#xD;
him out-of moneys I had not collected, I swore I'd do him violence-&#xD;
I felt like, and should most certainly have gone to his house and coin-&#xD;
mitted murder!" &#xD;
The physician shuddered at the thought.&#xD;
"But as caution suggested the propriety of arranging means to&#xD;
escape the penalty of such an act, I found it necessary to call upon a&#xD;
lady, with whom I had left, some time previous, a portion of my bag-&#xD;
gage ; this woman was a sharper of the keenest description ; she was&#xD;
married to a sea captain, and to abbreviate the matter, there was an&#xD;
intimacy between us."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, I understand, sir," observed the Doctor.&#xD;
"She, discovering my intentions, foreseeing the probable danger of&#xD;
such an affair, threw out hints that led me to adopt a wiser, and a far&#xD;
more pleasant; plan to revenge myself on the heartless miser. A check&#xD;
was forged for $3,000; a splendidly habited lady in a magnificent&#xD;
coach drove up to - Bank ; the check was presented and cashed,&#xD;
and that night a certain lady and gentleman might have been seen at&#xD;
Barnum's Hotel, in Baltimore, resting for a few hours en route south."&#xD;
" Josey, Josey, you are-I mean you have been, a bad boy, very&#xD;
bad boy," said the deeply interested Doctor, pouring out a glass of&#xD;
Otard. "Well, you were going off south ?2'&#xD;
"The lady and gentleman I mentioned, were," responded the cau-&#xD;
tious narrator, ""while certain parties, in this city, were kicking upa&#xD;
pretty dust, about certain sudden and mysterious disappearances. But&#xD;
old Prog, I 'll venture to swear upon a'mountain of books, was wish-&#xD;
jng in his heart that I had cut my throat, or stowed myself away in&#xD;
the river. Curse him! but never mind. The lady and gentleman&#xD;
traveled as far as Charleston, where the lady, chancing to see, at the&#xD;
hotel, a gentleman with a plentitude of gilt buttons about his clothes,&#xD;
and for whom she entertained an old and strong attachment, she forth-&#xD;
with placed her baggage and precious person under guard of this naval&#xD;
gentleman-shook hands with her late compagnon d' voyage, he plac-&#xD;
ing fifty eagles and a purse in her pocket, and bidding each other good-&#xD;
by, parted in the most friendly manner. The young gentleman then&#xD;
proceeded on his way to New Orleans, where he took up private lodg-&#xD;
ings for the winter, and laid off in perfect lavender, watching the next&#xD;
turn of fortune's wheel. My respects, Doc.," said Prog, draining an.&#xD;
other bumper. "Well, sir, my lodgings (Prog having got over a bar.&#xD;

assumed his identity) were directly opposite the mansion of oie of the&#xD;
oldest, richest families of that city-French, of course. The children&#xD;
of the old branch, had all received their education,.and spent their&#xD;
younger days in Paris. They had an elegant garden ; I frequently.&#xD;
admired the flowers, as I leaned over the garden wall-an intimacy,&#xD;
grew up between one of the sons and myself; and finally I was a guest&#xD;
in the mansion. The eldest daughter was a widow, with one son, a&#xD;
boy of some eighteen or twenty years of age, he at college, anJ one&#xD;
daughter just married: Madame -    owned two of the finest plan-&#xD;
tations on the river; counted her bankable funds and jewels by&#xD;
thousands; she was pretty, and as much disposed to dabble in love&#xD;
affairs or matrimony as I was. We made ourselves very agreeable to&#xD;
each other; my funds ran low. I was not the man to be mealy-mouthed&#xD;
to a friend ; I explained the state of my pecuniary affairs, assured her&#xD;
I had expectations, and both wealthy and respectable friends in the&#xD;
east. That was virgin truth, you know..&#xD;
"Decidedly," responded the physician, deeper than ever interested&#xD;
in the romance of the profligate's story.&#xD;
"'Well, sir, I struck while the iron was hot, though I pretended no&#xD;
great anxiety about the matter myself, which of course always makes&#xD;
the opposite party more pertimacionls. The upshot of it was, that the&#xD;
widow and I came to terms. I had kept the run of my affairs in New&#xD;
York through the agency of a friend, and learning that the coast was&#xD;
clear, as far as old Joe Prog and I were concerned, he having with-&#xD;
drawn the charge of forgery, and stopped, as I supposed, all legai&#xD;
action against rme, I swore allegiance to Madame --- ; she packed up&#xD;
her jewels, filled our purses, and sans cerenonie, we took an evening&#xD;
departure for parts unknown to her friends, and here we are."&#xD;
"'Von my soul, yoh have a 'romantic turn' truly, Josey. And&#xD;
pray, where is Mrs. Prog ? "&#xD;
"For the present, I took private and obscure lodgings, as it was&#xD;
probable that Mrs. P's friends might take it into their heads to follow&#xD;
us and bore us with impertinent questions ; and some of my old un-&#xD;
settled accounts might also turn up; but in spite of my care, you see&#xD;
I have had a row already 1"&#xD;
"Joe, the furious gentleman who assailed you was-"&#xD;
"Captain O - , husband of' the literary lady who did the financiering&#xD;
for the young gentleman whose traveling expedition, etc., I have just&#xD;
related. Curse the fellow, I never had much intimacy with him, and I&#xD;
am at a loss to account for his tracing and recognizing me so readily."&#xD;
"Aye, and as he has doubtless entered bai for his appearance to&#xD;
answer for the assault upon you, he is at large again, and may prove&#xD;
a dangerous acquaintance. lie struck you a very severe blow, but&#xD;
fortunately, nothing save a slight abrasion of the skin remains; so be&#xD;
guarded," said the physician.&#xD;
"I will; I ventured out to-day, sufficiently disguised, I thought, by&#xD;

again, 1'l be perfeCtl y ready to receive'them. I warrant."&#xD;
" The affhir with vour ftither I will see cleared up," said Dr. Swabs,&#xD;
. "and I a-ivise you,'by all teans, Josey, to have a reconciliation with&#xD;
your finnily ; introduce your lady to them, settle down, forget olc&#xD;
follies and'beget no new ones."&#xD;
"For the present, Doe.. let us waive all the mortifying crooks and&#xD;
turns of-dry morality. While there is vitality in my horl,, I will live.&#xD;
I've seen the entire (letails of human affairs; 'I thoroughly understand,&#xD;
as I think, man and woman: and I know it is an easy virtue to preach;&#xD;
but so tedious and laborious to practice, that devilish fvew, even for&#xD;
the golden premiums held forth, care to enter the lists ; that's true&#xD;
gospel, is it not ?"&#xD;
"Ah, Josey, my boy, I fear you are a sorry reasoner," said the&#xD;
physician, taking to himself a portion of the force of the rake's&#xD;
remarks; but do as you see proper: take my advice in its true light&#xD;
and let me know when we are to have a glimpse of Mrs. Prog, Jr?"&#xD;
"Doe., we are and ever have been friends; you have always stood&#xD;
by me, and afforded aid and good advice; for that I thank you, and&#xD;
shall be happy to give you a call with my box of diamonds, so'soon&#xD;
as the state of affairs will permit ; so good-'by for the present." Waiv-&#xD;
ing the invitation to dine, Joe Prog, Jr., lft the private door of the&#xD;
physician's dwelling and started for his lodgings.&#xD;

The home of the ballet dancer was yet damp with the teai's of sor-&#xD;
row for the departed parent. The funds and resources of Marie and&#xD;
her mother were exhausted; and the pangs of poverty, doubled with&#xD;
other griefs and misfortunes, rendered their situation sad indeed. Mr.&#xD;
Flapps, a frequent visitor of the little faiizily, had been their principal&#xD;
adviser, and partially arriang~ed an engagement at one of the minor&#xD;
theaters for Marieto appear in dances between the pieces, but the con-&#xD;
sideration was so trivial as to quite discourage the young artiste. Joo&#xD;

one occasion, by making her a present, or canceling, as an act of court.&#xD;
esy. as he declared, of rent due old Prog, when in fact Joe had drawn&#xD;
on his own purse, sent the money to his father, got the receipt and&#xD;
destroyed it.&#xD;
Conrad Vinton was the only one of the several male visitors of the&#xD;
ballet girl's home whose motives were not questionable. He, yet a&#xD;
stranger to the arts, duplicity, and licentiousness of the thousands of&#xD;
young men moving in what is called genteel society in a city, looked&#xD;
upon the sorrows and adverse fortunes of the poor girl and her mother&#xD;
with manly sympathy and respect, while her youth and personal&#xD;
charms inspired in him other feelings, sudden as they were strong.&#xD;
Dr. Swabs had frequently bantered the student in reference to his&#xD;
adventure in the watch-house with a ballet dancer, but he little&#xD;
dreamed that Conrad would be so deeply smitten with the heroine of&#xD;
theaffhir as to continue his calls at the residence of the late French-&#xD;
man, now that his professional services were no longer a matter of&#xD;
necessity or practical benefit. Conrad Vinton was the son and only&#xD;
male heir of a wealthy Genessee farmer; and offered a most desirable&#xD;
applicant, should he so incline, for taking one of the Doctor's daugh-&#xD;
ters off his hands, and become responsible for her future conduct, bed&#xD;
and board. And the Doctor not unfrequently drilled Mrs. Swabs in&#xD;
the matrimonial manual of bringing together, pairing off; and mating&#xD;
of young couples, just whether they felt interested in the performance&#xD;
or not. But as Conrad and Mrs. S, were not upon the very best gen-&#xD;
eral understanding with each other, not much was effected by her&#xD;
diplomacy, and therefore the Doctor left it to time, his very accom-&#xD;
plished daughter Amelia, to whoiii Mr. Vinton had shown a marked&#xD;
preference, and the taste of the student.&#xD;
Conrad Vinton had come to New York city and taken up his board&#xD;
with his popular preceptor, imbued with a most ardent zeal to study&#xD;
his profession, and not all the temptations, glitterings and seductive&#xD;
affairs of every day life in that gay metropolis had yet shaken his pur-&#xD;
pose, after nearly a two years' probation. lie kept little or no com-&#xD;
pany, knew but few persons in the city,. and passed most of his time&#xD;
in study and with the Doctor's family and friends visiting the house.&#xD;
One false step, however, leads-to many, or a fall so grievious, as oft&#xD;
renders recovery almost hopeless. The good impulses of his heart led&#xD;
the student to continue his visits to Marie, but above the necessity of&#xD;
seeking, as Joe. Frog and thousands of others have, a matrimonial&#xD;
alliance from pecuniary policy, he was ,not so circumspect in his&#xD;
movements, and therefore rather welcomed the attachment he found&#xD;
gathermg i his bosom for the poor and humble, yet beautiful belle of&#xD;
the ballet. '&#xD;
Marie, as yet, had never indulged in an ardent love dream; she&#xD;
looked upon the visits of Conrad Vinton as those of others, through&#xD;
sympathy or friendly regard for her mother; and even in that light&#xD;
&#xD;
M1E LESSATRE                     67&#xD;
had the timid student rather endeavored to make his visits appear;&#xD;
but his acquaintance with Joe Prog, Jr., was destined to pervert the&#xD;
even tenor of his way, and materially affect the destiny of the poor&#xD;
ballet girl. To a depraved heart and mind like Prog's, woman's&#xD;
virtue, purity of character, or firmness under temptation, was all&#xD;
moonshine. To him a beautiful woman was a gilded butterfly, which&#xD;
would yield a transitory divertisement to pursue; her poverty or mis-&#xD;
fortunes were weak points of the citadel of her honor, through which&#xD;
practiced scoundrels like himself could the more easily storm the for-&#xD;
tress and carry off the prize.&#xD;
Mario had caught Prog's eye ; he had made his estimate as to the&#xD;
mode and cost of gaining his object, with all the mathematical cer-&#xD;
tainty of the spider that spreads its net to entrap the unwary insect&#xD;
coming within its reach. Flapps was a man young Frog could soon&#xD;
dispose of, through the powerful agency of his now inflated purse.&#xD;
The young actor, who had shown a strong and growing attachment&#xD;
for the belle of the ballet, could be given over to the care of Flapps-&#xD;
a puff and a supper would silence him; but Conrad Vinton-&#xD;
" That sheep-faced student of Swabs', he will be a bore ; but I must&#xD;
manage him. He has partly consented to accompany me, one of these&#xD;
evenings, on a tour around the city, and egad, I must put him through&#xD;
a course of vegetation before he. has got too fast a hold upon the&#xD;
sylphide's imagination. D--n me, that's the way; as old Bill Shak-&#xD;
speare observes, "dull not device by coldness or delay." Young&#xD;
Sawbones, I'll show you seraphs and sylphides, who, in your unso-&#xD;
phisticated optics, will make our little goddess of the fantastic toe&#xD;
dwindle into the insignificance of a simple dairy maid amid naiads&#xD;
and graces. Yes, my young Genesseean, you must see the elephant,&#xD;
and leave all the rest-to me, as his Satanic majesty will prudently&#xD;
observe when old Joe Prog closes his earthly accounts."&#xD;
Thus soliloquized the libertine, as he adjusted his toilet for an evening&#xD;
from home, having began his career anew among the vile of old and new&#xD;
associates; leaving the rash woman who had risked a'second marriage,&#xD;
at forty, with a random adventurer, and a confirmed vagabond or&#xD;
villain at that, to spend her evenings alone in the domicil of strangers,&#xD;
while he squandered her gold upon the tables of the fashionable halls&#xD;
in the neighborhood of the Astor, and in the palaces of lascivious&#xD;
pleasure, so numerous and recherche in the same vicinity ; and where&#xD;
amid the glitter of coin, garnish of jewelry, expensive and gay apparel,&#xD;
sumptuous and costly furniture, wines, etc., misery and vice hold&#xD;
their bitterest tribunals; where souls are damned, and female grace&#xD;
and beauty are hourly offered up sacrifices to the lascivious passions&#xD;
and tempting gold of all sorts and orders of men.&#xD;

"AhI, sir, it is a long and expensive journey," responded Madame&#xD;
L. to Joy Prog, that evening as he 'dropped in,'to meet Conrad Vin-&#xD;
ton, and she anl her daughter had just been perusing a letter frokn&#xD;
Mad. Ellsler, offering Marie a traveling engagement during her stay&#xD;
in the. country, if Marie would imiiiedately join her in one of th&#xD;
western cities.&#xD;
"I should cci tainly be pleased to go," said Marie, "much pleased;:-&#xD;
indeed, for I am quite weary of this lazy life I 'in leading, and I must&#xD;
look to my own exertions now, for the support of mother and myself."&#xD;
"Spoken like a girl of spirit," said Joe Prog, who was pleased to&#xD;
see a ready avenue about to offer itself for the furtherance of his vile'&#xD;
purposes. ," It must be horrible for one of your age, temperament&#xD;
and professional talent, living so retired and bereft of all pastiiiie and&#xD;
amusement. I would accept of this engagement at once."&#xD;
"The expenses of our journey there, will present, I fear, my daugh-&#xD;
ter's acceptance of this engagement," said the widow.&#xD;
"Would you, Madam, propose accompanying your daughter ? "&#xD;
"1 certainly think it almost impossible for my daughter to go alone."&#xD;
"She has numerous acquaintances in the ballet of Ellsler, has she&#xD;
gnot ? "&#xD;
"Oh, yes, mother, I know them," responded Marie, "they were all&#xD;
kind, very kind to me, sir."&#xD;
"Well, the di;tanze is not so very great," the rake continued, "the&#xD;
expenses of your daughter will be light; I will cheerfully loan you&#xD;
the amount, Madam; I am also acquainted with a ha ly going to Oin-&#xD;
cinnati in a (lay or two; she will be pleased, I know, to have the&#xD;
company of Miss Marie. Ellsler will make a short tour and be here&#xD;
again by the close of the year, and your expenses could be saved by&#xD;
your remaining at home."&#xD;
"I think, dear mother, Mr. Prog's propositions are worthy of your&#xD;
acquiescence," said Marie. "I have no fear of traveling alone, but if&#xD;
the lady Mr. Prog mentions accompanies me to Cincinnati,.1 shall&#xD;
then meet Madame Ellsler, and be almost at home; I shall be much&#xD;
pleased, dear mother, to go."&#xD;
Joe Prog so plied his persuasive eloquence, and offered such tempt.&#xD;
ing facilities for the parting of the mother and her child, that the mat-&#xD;
ter was finally arranged, and the mother reconciled to trust hei' daugh-&#xD;
ter to the evil counsel of the most depraved of imen.&#xD;
The ceremony had scarcely been completed when Conrad Vinton,&#xD;

ERY--THE BRACELET AGAIN-ANXIOUS INQUIRIES, ETC.&#xD;
"I would give something handsome to find Mons. Lessaire, to-day,&#xD;
that I would," said a tall and rather handsome young man, dressed in&#xD;
a midshipman's attire, as he walked up and down the floor of one of&#xD;
the city hotels of Gotham.&#xD;
"ha, ha! George, I think there must be something more than your&#xD;
devotion to musical instructions, or friendship for old Frenchmen,"&#xD;
echoed the midshipman's companion, a somewhat older man, and a&#xD;
grade or-two his superior, perhaps, in the service.&#xD;
"Come, d-n it now, Pinckney, my boy, out with it; you 've talked&#xD;
of this Lessaire so much since we cleared Pensacola for the north, that&#xD;
I've got interested in your pursuit ; isn 't there a female figurehead or&#xD;
two in the old Frenchman's mess that have cast anchor somnewhe'e&#xD;
about your heart's soundings? "&#xD;
"To make a clear breast of it, Frank, there is."&#xD;
"Of course."                                       -&#xD;
" Lessaire had but one'child in Orleans, the prettiest-"&#xD;
"ha, ha! the old story; now comes the romance of the matter !I&#xD;
"hang romance ! I tell you, sir, Marie, the French musician's&#xD;
daughter, was-"&#xD;
"TThe loveliest creature you ever saw afloat ? "&#xD;
. "My mere opinion would not make her so, Frank; she was con-&#xD;
sidered the petite belle of Orleans,-everywhere. She was a girl of&#xD;
uncommon talent, too."&#xD;
"Was, ehi? played everything in the musical line, I suppose, from&#xD;
boatswain's whistle to the bagpipes."&#xD;
"She was a sylphide in fornm-"&#xD;
"Come now, d-n it, don't crowd her-under."&#xD;
"'Listen-she danced like a sprite ; she sang and accompanied her&#xD;
self upon the piano in the most elegant manner, and as to her ace-&#xD;
by the Lord; she was the most bewitching little brumiette you" ever&#xD;
dreamed of!"&#xD;
"Well, no doubt, George, she wvas a perfect angel, and I don't&#xD;
wonder at your wishing to keep in her wake. ldwever, your chance,&#xD;
in a city like this, to find such a waif, will be very doubtful."&#xD;
"1 'In afraid so. Thbey left Orleans in very indifferent pecuniary cir-&#xD;

swindled, was proud, and not being able to keep up his head there, came&#xD;
here, taught music for awhile, and finally seems to have disappeared."&#xD;
"Perhaps the old fellow returned to France ? "&#xD;
"It naybe so. I'll give a $10 bill, Frank, to get any clue of them."&#xD;
"Oh   keep a good heart, my boy, you '11 stumble over them yet,&#xD;
somewhere, I'll'bet a thousand on it. There is a divinity that shapes&#xD;
our course, you know ; your divinity in petticoats will run athwart&#xD;
your bows, one of these days, just when you are not on the look-out&#xD;
for such a prize."&#xD;
"Not improbable. But come, I'm going to take a walk, will you&#xD;
go along?"&#xD;
"Yes, I may as well go out and see the fashion and beauty of the&#xD;
town. It's about muster time with them on Broadway."&#xD;
And the two middies stepped out and began their stroll.&#xD;
"By the by, I met Lieut. T--  this morning," said Frank.&#xD;
"Did you? how does the old fellow look, Frank ? "&#xD;
"Fine as silk ! ha, ha! he's a rare old cruiser ; he was telling me a&#xD;
devilish good yarn about an adventure he had last night at one of their&#xD;
fashionable establishments here in town; something about an affair&#xD;
of intrigue-of one of the hotel keepers-voluptuous woman-traced&#xD;
to a certain palace up town-husband and band of rowdy friends rushed&#xD;
in-T- --- was there, several gay parties about-T--.- says he held a&#xD;
pistol in one hand and a door-knob in the other, expecting a regular&#xD;
engagement, but managed to slip his cables and scud before the action&#xD;
became general. Talking about beauties, T--- says he saw a nymph&#xD;
there last night that has set the young fellows of this town all agog.&#xD;
He says she really looks more like a marble statue, of the most elegant&#xD;
conceivable loveliness, than a human being'  I promised to go with&#xD;
him to-night, take a bottle of their wine, and have a stare at this&#xD;
courtezan enchantress. Will you go along, George ? "&#xD;
"No, I b:.lieve not. I have some calls to make this evening.' My&#xD;
brother and his wife are stopping at the American; I must go and see&#xD;
them. Just stop in here a moment, I want to get some jewelry for&#xD;
the girls at home," said one of two youngsters, as they stepped into a&#xD;
large retail jewelry establishment near the great trottoir, Broadway.&#xD;
In glancing over the show cases of the jeweler, George Pinckney,&#xD;
now a midshipman in the U. S. Navy, and on his first visit to the&#xD;
great metropolis, saw an article that attracted his attention.&#xD;
"Sir, I wish you would allow inc to look at that bracelet," said the&#xD;
midshipman, pointing out the article.&#xD;
"This?" answered the jeweler, producing the box on which the&#xD;
bracelet lay; "I do not care about selling it, however," he remarked.&#xD;
"What have you there, George ?" asked his friend ; "anything&#xD;
rare?"&#xD;
"Good God, what a coincidence ! " abstractedly muttered the mid-&#xD;
shipman."&#xD;
&#xD;
I:,&#xD;
&#xD;
[fA1lE LEStIAIIE.&#xD;
&#xD;
"Eh? what have you found there, l'inckney ?"&#xD;
"Where did you obtain this, sir--excuse me, if you please, but&#xD;
how came this article in your possession ? " continued George, without&#xD;
noticing his friend's inquiry.&#xD;
"Well, sir, very strangely," said the jeweler. "Not so strange, to&#xD;
be sure, either, as I am buying and selling jewelry daily ; but there&#xD;
was a little circumstance connected with this bracelet which is not&#xD;
common in my way."&#xD;
The two officers stared the jeweler in the face-George Pinckney in&#xD;
anxious silence, to know the detail of the circumstance, and his friend&#xD;
in mute wonder as to what it was all about.&#xD;
rA year or two ago," continued the jeweler, "one bleak morning, a&#xD;
"Yes ! " eagerly echoed George.&#xD;
"A Frenchman came into my store and wished me to buy this&#xD;
bracelet."&#xD;
"Well ?"&#xD;
"'Well,.I looked at the article and saw, at a glance, that ij was&#xD;
valuable ; it contained one diamond-O, it 's not there now; I removed&#xD;
Oit, an'l set a 'Cape May' in its place," said the jeweler, noticing the&#xD;
midshipman's scrutiny of the bracelet he still hel in his hand.&#xD;
Go on,, if you please," said George.&#xD;
"The diamond was very fine and'large, and was surrounded by a&#xD;
cluster of smaller ones, the whole not worth les3 than three hundred&#xD;
w                            t       etars.n&#xD;
"A great deal more money, sir," responded George ; "but go on."&#xD;
"Did this ever belong to you, sir? "&#xD;
.    "No matter, sir, proceed; I '11 answer you presently."&#xD;
"Well, I was suspicious that it was stolen,, and sent out one of my&#xD;
clerks, got an officer and arrested the old Frenchman, and went with&#xD;
him to the police office. There the old fellow gave us such an account&#xD;
of the matter as was deemed quite satisfactory, and I -retained tie&#xD;
bracelet, more as a pledge than a purchase, advancing him $50 onit&#xD;
and promised to keep it for a year, subject to his redemption of it. i&#xD;
have never seen the old man since," concluded the jeweler.&#xD;
"What were the circumstances of explanation that induced you to&#xD;
believe the Frenchman's story in.relation to this bracelet?$ " inquired&#xD;
George.&#xD;
"Tie old man stated that this bracelet had been given to his daugh-&#xD;
ter--"&#xD;
"Exactly, in New Orleans?"&#xD;
"Yes, I see you know something about the matter."&#xD;
" Proceed, if you please ; his name was Lessaire, a teacher of music I&#xD;
. "Well, yes, that was the name. He was at that time playing thG&#xD;
violin hi the Park Theater orchestra."&#xD;
"And his daughter, to whom thissbracelet was given?"&#xD;

"Was about to make her appearance there as a 'ballet dancer; shi&#xD;
was engaged with Ellsler; I saw her there, in fact ; she was considered&#xD;
the belle of the ballet corps," continued the jeweler.&#xD;
"This is quite a coincidence , George," observed his companion; "I&#xD;
told you you'd find your prize presently."&#xD;
" Isnit it strange ? " exclaimed the midshipman.&#xD;
"Well, as I was going to say, the old man's daughter was getting&#xD;
ready to come out, and they were so poor as to be unable to provide&#xD;
the necessary dresses for her, so they sold, or rather I took this, and ad-&#xD;
vanced them sufficient to answer their purpose."&#xD;
"Did you know where they lived?"&#xD;
"I believe they lived in Rose street, near Franklin street ; I'm not&#xD;
sure ; but I know one of the musicians who plays at the Park; he lives&#xD;
near bfV, and can tell you something about the family, I think. I'll&#xD;
give you his address."&#xD;
"Thank you! Now, sir, I wish to observe that I gave this bracelet&#xD;
to the Frenchman's daughter, in New Orleans. I gave it to her the&#xD;
day the family left for New York. They were poor then, I believe,&#xD;
but had lived and moved in good society there. I never could learn&#xD;
what became of them here, or whether they ever reached here, but I&#xD;
hope this singular circumstance may lead to my finding them. I wish&#xD;
to regain this bracelet, sir, with the diamonds you took from it also.&#xD;
What will you sell it to me for?"&#xD;
"The diamond I have set in a ring for a gentleman to present to&#xD;
his mistress, one of our most 'dashing belles of the street ; 1 sold that&#xD;
for one hundred dollars. It is intrinsically worth double that, and&#xD;
doubtless worth much more to you, sir."&#xD;
"It is," said the midshipman, "and I will take it."&#xD;
Having made this and other purchases, the "middies" leftto specu-&#xD;
late upon the curious and strange vicissitudes of life, and. George&#xD;
Pinckney to further trace the raveled end of the clue to the where-&#xD;

"Oh! I think you'll be delighted, my dear child. The journey&#xD;
and change of scene will be of great advantage to your health, my&#xD;
dear."&#xD;
"For that, I am more than anxious that Marie should go, Madam,"&#xD;
said Mad. Lessaire. "Marie is too young to bear such afflictions as&#xD;
we have lately endured; it is too much for her."&#xD;
"You are right, Madam ; you 'are considerate, as a careful mother&#xD;
should be; you are quite right; awl this trip to the West will be.of&#xD;
great benefit to her. My nephew, Mr. Frog, feels so anxious about&#xD;
the young lady's welfare, that he would insist that I should call and&#xD;
see nu. and let you know when I am ready to go."&#xD;
"Mr. Prog is very kind," said Marie ; "lie has certainly been very&#xD;
kind to us ; I trust it may be in our power, some day not fat' distant,&#xD;
to repay his goodness."&#xD;
" Oh never mind that, dear child ; he does a good act entirely&#xD;
regardless of future reward; dear, good soul, your case is'not a solid.&#xD;
tary one (!) that has enlisted that boy's sympathy," said Mrs Ilarpy.&#xD;
"lie is very unlike his father, indeed," responded Mad. L.&#xD;
"Unlike his father ! Goo 1 lord ! he is no more like that old tyrant&#xD;
and miser than I'in like-like, than I'm like his father," said the old&#xD;
lady, hard run for a simile of something unlike herself.&#xD;
" You reside out in the West? 'I think Mr. Prog told us so," said&#xD;
Marie.&#xD;
"Yes, yes, dear, I reside out there; I have lived in Louisville, in&#xD;
the State of Virginny, these ten years," said Mrs. Ilarpy.&#xD;
"Louisville, did you say, Madam? " asked Marie, noticing the old&#xD;
lady's geographical errors.&#xD;
"Yes, my dear, yes-Louisville, State of Virginny."&#xD;
"Louisville, Madam, is in Kentucky."&#xD;
"Oh,'yes, blast-oh,' yes, I, a-so it is, you are right, my dear,"&#xD;
echoed the old one, nearly forgetting the dignity of the part she was&#xD;
enacting for Joe Prog.&#xD;
"You, Madam, have traveled that way, and know the route and&#xD;
means of travel well ?" sail Ma 1. L. inquiringly.&#xD;
"Oh, yes, I've been over it a dozens times, and I know all the tavern&#xD;

"Tavern-keepers! stage drivers," echoed Marie and her mother.&#xD;
" Ah ! excuse me; I, a-, I-mean the hotel-keepers, where we are&#xD;
le stop on the way, and the-and the baggage men, who take care of_&#xD;
our baggage ; yes, yes," said the sharp but ignorant old wretch.&#xD;
"Ah, yes! that is well," answered Mad. Lessaire. "When do you&#xD;
start, madam ?"&#xD;
"To-morrow morning, ma'am, I go; I will be here with a carriage,&#xD;
ist five o'clock in the morning; be all ready, my dear, get every stitch&#xD;
ready to-night, no fussing about in the morning, but be ready to jump&#xD;
n and off; that is the way I used to do when I was a gal."&#xD;
"Well, my daughter will be prepared," said Mad. L. "I feel very loth&#xD;
have her go so far alone, among strangers, young and inexperienced."&#xD;
" Young and inexperienced ! ,Why, bless you, ma'am, that face of&#xD;
ves would take her all over the world safe as a button 1"&#xD;
"I trust that my daughter has a stronger safeguard for her protec-&#xD;
tion than her handsome features," the mother replied. "Necessity&#xD;
eemns to part us; the separation, I hope, will be short, and my prayer&#xD;
sill ever be with her-that God, in ,his providence for the helpless,&#xD;
fill guard and protect her from all evil." The widow wept ; her&#xD;
-eart was full, an:d to suppress her own emotions Marie continued to&#xD;
biterrogate Mrs. larpy in regard to suclh further particulars as were&#xD;
acessary in prosecuting their journey.  The preliminaries being&#xD;
ty settled, the old lady bade them good afternoon, and departed.&#xD;
' Mother, I do not like that old lady," said Marie, after Mrs.&#xD;
arpy was gone. "She 's so rough, so very coarse in her manners."&#xD;
-She is, Marie, a very curious kind of an old lady; but your poor&#xD;
tearifather and I have often laughed at those rough people who care&#xD;
'om the upper countries down to New Orleans. The western people&#xD;
f this country are mostly unpolished-rough in their manner, but&#xD;
nevertheless of good and honest dispositions. Mrs. Ilarpy may prove&#xD;
a very agreeable person when you ai'e better acquainted, my child."&#xD;
"I hope so, dear mother. Now, I shall have but little time to see&#xD;
say of my few, few friends; but no matter. I will leave tiem my&#xD;
compliments, and you, dear mother, will deliver the  , ' then hum-&#xD;
ming a favorite air, she busily and gayly went about p eking up her&#xD;
wardrobe, &amp;amp;c. As the poor girl sat by the side of a large traveling&#xD;
ease, handling some of her trinkets, she became sad-tye 'lively air&#xD;
was hushed, and as her'mother turned from some employment of her&#xD;
tin-that of manufacturing artificial flowers for the milliner-she&#xD;
held Marie with her hands clasped over something in her lap,&#xD;
epon which hefffhce reclined. She was shedding tears. Mad. L.&#xD;
'was so impressed herself, that she made no effort to break the spell&#xD;
r several minutes. She at length spoke-..     .&#xD;
" Marie, my dear-"       -&#xD;
" Mother, this casket reminds Tue of a dream I had last night. I&#xD;

we sailed. Mother, shall we ever see them again ? " said Marie, stir&#xD;
agitated with heartfelt emotions.&#xD;
"I trust, Marie, we shall. Should Mad. Elisler go to New Or&#xD;
leans, I will accompany you; I hope our altered circumstances wiid&#xD;
n9t shut us out from former friendly relations."&#xD;
Mother," continued Marie, "I dreamed that.several persons were&#xD;
seeking us; they were asking every body if they knew us; they sail&#xD;
they.had been all over America to find us, but though I heard the&#xD;
inquiring and could see them from the strong place or dungeon wherw-&#xD;
you and I were fastened up, by some cruel people, I was not allowed&#xD;
to speak. But, after a time, one person came close to a loop-hold"&#xD;
where I was looking out-he was a young gentleman in uniform-J&#xD;
put my lips close to his ear and asked his name; lie wliispere&#xD;
'George, don 't you recollect me, Marie?  Look.' I looked, and i&#xD;
was George Pinckney. He held up his hand, mother, and in it I sad&#xD;
my bracelet !"  As she spoke this last word, overcome with her feet&#xD;
ings, the ballet girl fell back as pale and lifeless as a statue.&#xD;
The mother, by well-directed restoratives, soon revived the poor&#xD;
girl, whose mind, still intent upon her dream, heeded not the varie&#xD;
exclamations of her parent, but continued-&#xD;
"lie held up the bracelet, mothmer-I knew it well-but its lustrous,&#xD;
jewels were gone. Georgy looked sweetly upon me, and'said there ie&#xD;
another looking for you, see-I followed the direction of his inger&#xD;
and away oft in the dun distance, I saw thousands of armed men-so~-&#xD;
diers; it appeared to be a great smoking battle field, and they were&#xD;
carrying off the wounded ; one litter came near us.; I saw the face&#xD;
of, the wounded man; it was like my father's; I shrieked, and alt&#xD;
disappeared but George Pinekney, and lie cried, 'See, Marie, he iS&#xD;
there again!' I looked, and saw the same face again; it was older&#xD;
now ; sunburnt, but robust; he was dress in the handsome suit o&#xD;
an officer of French cavalry, lie appea'  be walking with great&#xD;
exertion to reach us, but a broad, sto  river intervened, and he&#xD;
could not cross. It was my brother, m  dear brother ! I knew his&#xD;
face, it was so like my dear, dear father's.. I called to him, he waived&#xD;
his cap, and I awoke."&#xD;
Mutually embracing, the mother and daughter were locked some&#xD;
minutes in each other's arms in silence..&#xD;
This tableau of emotion was sundered by a tap at the door. Drying&#xD;
her tears hurriedly, Madame L. led the now feeble daughter to their&#xD;
old fashioned lounge, to repose while she attended the visitor. To her'&#xD;
great surprise, as she opened the door, Mad. Mignard, e rantly attired,&#xD;
rushed into her arias and gave way to a flood of teais  nd bitter'&#xD;
lamentations.&#xD;
"Oh ! Madame, Madame, I am ruined ! I am ruined !"&#xD;
Marie, hearing the cry of distress, threw off her own grief, rushed&#xD;
to the little hall and was soon clasped in time arms of her mother's&#xD;

Mignard had occasion to return liome'fbr an instrument, to get which.&#xD;
he was obliged to force his room door, and upon the floor where Mad.&#xD;
M. had dropped it, in her haste or negligence, lay a note, appointing&#xD;
the previous night's meeting between two guilty parties already known&#xD;
to the reader. Mignard first whistled, then shrugging. his shoulders,&#xD;
uttered a little Ih'ench and as much English, got his instrument and&#xD;
returned to the orchestra, hummidg a lively air, from which it was&#xD;
evident the little laison of his caere ami and her medical friend was&#xD;
not a matter of so serious a nature as one would, under some circum-&#xD;
stances, be led to conceive.&#xD;
Not missing the billet, which she supposed was locked tight and&#xD;
fast in her dressing-case, Madame, with all the voluble tact of a&#xD;
woman-especially a false or fallen one.-began to explain the partic-&#xD;
ulars of her absence from home. The theater being out before she&#xD;
reached her domicile, Mignard was there first,°smnoking his cigar and&#xD;
s ping his claret, as composed as a Turk, and a great deal more jolly.&#xD;
Monsieur, signifying no desire to disbelieve or argue the matter,&#xD;
Madame considered the affair all right, and they retired in the best&#xD;
humor. Next morning Monsieur sends Madame on a long imaginary&#xD;
erran:I to the upper part of the city, and which consumed her time,&#xD;
until noon. When she returned, a rumor prevailed in the house' that&#xD;
Monsieur M. and the Jewess had eloped! It proved true enough.&#xD;
Monsieur gave Madame some of the particulars in a letter he left for&#xD;
her, alludmngen passant to the doctor's note, which lie enclosed. le&#xD;
bale her an adieu as pleasant as a parson at grace. The Jew was&#xD;
the worst discomfited of the several pxrties ; he not only lost Iis-wife,&#xD;
but what was more touching to his feelings, coin and jewels to the&#xD;
amount of sonic three or four thousanddollars, seemed to have followed&#xD;
by the same advent.  damee Mignard and the Jew were for a time&#xD;

we part before it is too late. No hesitation, sir; choose and be prompt,&#xD;
for I 'm determined if you do not perform the first, the last I will see&#xD;
executed immediately."&#xD;
The roue wavered a moment ; it was but a feeble struggle between&#xD;
the sediments of his departed honor or moral principle, and the giant&#xD;
force of his innate rascality, in which, of course, the latter quality&#xD;
triumphed.&#xD;
"Yes, Louisa, to-morrow evening we will be married-; you shall&#xD;
not doubt my constancy or honor. (1) Now, my dear, we must set&#xD;
about our domestic affairs at once. We must have a handsome estab.&#xD;
lishment, we must furnish it well, and I may as well set about it to&#xD;
- day.".&#xD;

&#xD;
"Now you talk rational and satisfactory," said she, " proceed at&#xD;
once, follow your own taste and judgment in the details, sir, and I will&#xD;
be satisfied."&#xD;
"But, my dear, I nust have funds."&#xD;
"Funds? Why, bless you; man, have I not already placed at your&#xD;
disposal nearly eight thousand dollars? Certainly that will answer&#xD;
for the present."&#xD;
"But, my dear madam, consider our expenses for the past three&#xD;
months."&#xD;
"Expenses! heavens, why they could not have been important; I&#xD;
have lived, I 'm sure, in the plainest possible manner since our arrival&#xD;
here ! "&#xD;
"Well, madam, to cut a long argument short, I have not a hundred&#xD;
dollars in the world ! I admit that I have been foolish, squandered a&#xD;
portion of the funds I received from you, but if a promise of an amende&#xD;
be any penance for the past, I will atone in the future. Come, let me&#xD;
have three thousand, that will answer for the first outlay. Come, now,&#xD;
don 't be penurious, my dear."&#xD;
Madam       was wealthy ; in Baltimore she had deposited consid-&#xD;
erable finds. She retained some ten thousand dollars upon leaving&#xD;
New Orleans, as ready change. Joe Prog had wheedled her out of the&#xD;
major part of this and ran through it. She was far from being penu-&#xD;
rious, but the evident folly of her acquaintance and connection with&#xD;
a man whose character was becoming hourly more transparent to her,&#xD;
was now busy at work with her reason, and she wavered 'twixt dan-&#xD;
gerous poles-honor and impulse, self-respect and misplaced affection.&#xD;
It was a dangerous game for the libertine and-he lost; for the per-&#xD;
plexed widow claimed time to reflect before she made any further con-&#xD;
cession or opened again her coffers. It was in vain that Frog resorted&#xD;
to loving and endearing persuasions ; art and eloquence all failed, for&#xD;
the more he sued, the sterner became the widow, until, provoked and&#xD;
enraged, the roue began upon a higher key.&#xD;
"1Iadam, I want a draft for three thousand dollars, or by heavens I'll&#xD;
revoke my promise!"&#xD;
"Sir, I do not hesitate now to say, that in such case I shall be the&#xD;
gainer by it," said the widow, still pacing up and down the chamber.&#xD;
"Do you insist on denying me further resources?"&#xD;
"I do most positively ." replied the widow, firmly.&#xD;
"Then, madam," said Prog, rising and advancing menacingly to-&#xD;
wards his victim, "by G-d ! I will expose you here-everywhere !"&#xD;
"Do so; base man, do it. I now see, sir, your true character, and&#xD;
I should wonder if you stop short of the robbery or murder of me!':&#xD;
"Woman, don't you dare to use such language to me-don 't,. or&#xD;
by the great gods I 'hi-"&#xD;
"Stand ofl, sir!"  Don 't advance another step, or you shall ie at .&#xD;
my feet !" cried the widow, as she drew from her bosom a keen and&#xD;
&#xD;
4&#xD;
&#xD;
7/&#xD;
&#xD;
I&#xD;
&#xD;
beautiful dirk and threw her fine figure into an attitude or aefence&#xD;
while her piercing black eyes shone like an adder's upon the dismayed&#xD;
rake.&#xD;
The closing scene of this serious matter could not fail to arouse the&#xD;
occupants of the house. A noise of persons approaching the chamber&#xD;
was now heard. Frog seated himself, and to the hurried knock upon&#xD;
the door, he replied, "Come in."&#xD;
Quite a deputation, headed by the landlord of the house, appeared&#xD;
in the hall; he, acting as spokesman, desired to know the cause of the&#xD;
disturbance. Joe informed him that it being of a private nature, he&#xD;
was not disposed to give an enplanation, but demandino the bill, inti-&#xD;
mated his intention of leaving the house. The landlorcf and his posse&#xD;
withdrew, and Joe Frog went to work to pack up his multitude of&#xD;
baggage. The widow, either feeling unpleasant or unsafe to remain&#xD;
longer in the room, withdrew to the parlor, merely intimating to her&#xD;
lately betrothed that she hoped he would not disturb or remove any&#xD;
portion of her private baggage.&#xD;
" D-n you," muttered Joe Frog, "you'll not get out of my clutches&#xD;
so easy as all that-I'll have you."&#xD;
In haste he packed his luggage, and then as rapidly began to rum-&#xD;
mage the drawers and travelingeases of the widow. In her writing&#xD;
case he found a draft on one of her Baltimore bankers for nine thousand&#xD;
dollars, only lacking her signature, and which draft lie now renem-&#xD;
bared was drawn up but a few days before for the purpose of pur-&#xD;
chasing a residence Frog had spoken to her about, but which matter&#xD;
had been postponed indefinitely.&#xD;
Au! ha! this will be just the thing!" said Joe'in triumph;" now&#xD;
for the finish of it."  Drawing out the widow's writing materials and&#xD;
several papers bearing her autograph, lie signed the draft-it being&#xD;
made payable to himself-endorsed it, and placed it in  his, pocket-&#xD;
book.&#xD;
"For fear of accident," he continued, "my lady, I'll just draw&#xD;
lightly on your private purse. Locked, eh? Well, as Paddy said to&#xD;
the mail bags, 'locks upon -leather make hack-knives laugh,'" and&#xD;
forthwith the unblushing scoundrel revered the leather case containing&#xD;
some hundreds of gold coins, and selecting five or six hundred dollars,&#xD;
he placed it in his own baggage, rang the bell, ordered a servant to&#xD;
go for a carriage and call up the landlord, which being done, Pros&#xD;
addressed that person:&#xD;
"Sir, my wife and I have fallen out; she's a bad woman ; every&#xD;
man best knows his own affairs-we were married in haste, and I have&#xD;
had plentyof leisure to repent. She is not fit to remain in your house&#xD;
a moment; I will pay the bill up to date. She will endeavor to stay,&#xD;
probably; she is not fit to remain in a respectable house, sir, one&#xD;
hour."&#xD;
"Then, sir, she shall go; she sha'nt stay," replied the landlord.&#xD;

"She is a vile woman, sir-imposed upon me, robbed me, would&#xD;
have blasted me, sir," continued the scoundrel.&#xD;
"Well, sir, we all said she was sort of strange; I was suspicious&#xD;
of her ; she never ventured out in the street: I was very suspicious,"&#xD;
echoed the landlord, as Prog made his eyes twinkle with the widow's&#xD;
gold he was paying into his itching palm.a&#xD;
" Now, sir, we are square."&#xD;
" Yes, sir, thank you, thank you."&#xD;
"Not at all, sir; now there is an eagle for the servants, divide it&#xD;
among them."&#xD;
"Yes, sir; really it is a great pity so fine, generous a gentleman&#xD;
should be so deceived, sir; I am very sorry for you; upon my soul.&#xD;
There's plaguy ugly women in this world-too many of 'em, sir," con-&#xD;
tinued the generous old brute, as he pinched over his money.&#xD;
"There is the carriage," said Joe, looking out of the window ; I&#xD;
am going up to Albany, sir, and will be back again next week, and&#xD;
stop with you when this woman has left. She may give a terrible&#xD;
account of me; don't believe m word she utters; every man knows&#xD;
his own business best ; she's a bad woman."&#xD;
"She must go, sir; I won 't harbor her here, sir, nor hear a word out&#xD;
of her."&#xD;
"Good bye, sir," said the scoundrel, shaking the landlord by the&#xD;
hand, and then whispering in his ear, "keep my room until I return,&#xD;
I'll pay well for it! "&#xD;
The landlord was bought and paid for, and the roue left.&#xD;
It is hardly necessary to say that the widow was the mark of con-&#xD;
temptuous sneers end insinuations from  the household, male and&#xD;
female, from the servants to the master ; but she did not condescend&#xD;
to notice their brutality, simply ordered a carriage, freely distributed,&#xD;
from her abundantly filled purse, small change to the gaping servants,.&#xD;
and to the inquiry of the coach driver as he placed her baggage in&#xD;
and on the vehicle, where he was to drive to, said, "To the Astor&#xD;
House!" which still farther confounded the landlord and his posse.&#xD;
The next evening Marie and her ghoul of a companion were in&#xD;
Baltimore, whither they were pre-eded by Joe Prog, Jr., in an old&#xD;
character, but with a new name, and their respective movements will&#xD;
furnish some deeply interesting incidents for fut.ire chapter.&#xD;

" I-I must, I suppose, for--forgive him. lie's been a-a rascally&#xD;
depraved boy; very depraved heartless b-b-boy, though."&#xD;
"lie is repentant now. I think," said Dr. Swabs.&#xD;
"Is he repentant, Doctor? lie-lie has been to see-see you, elh ?"&#xD;
"Yes, he called to see tme as soon as he arrived in the city, some&#xD;
weeks ago. I saw he was an altered man. I told him it was better&#xD;
that the family differences were healed, and proposed to be the instru-&#xD;
ment of a reconciliation between you; lie is an altered man; he's&#xD;
married, and-"&#xD;
"Married ! what, our Joe married?" echoed the assembled family&#xD;
of Prog, present to see the dying scene of their sordid progenitor.&#xD;
" Yes, your brother is married to a highly respectable-"&#xD;
" Res1pectable!' they sneeringly echoed--" Some butcher or baker's&#xD;
daughter, we suppose, he wants to force into the family," said some.&#xD;
"Some shop-girl or worse, perhaps," said the rest.&#xD;
"Si-silence,-hang you, all silence," wheezed the old man. " Doc-&#xD;
Doctor, who has tha--tha--that boy married ?"&#xD;
"A very respectable lady, I nndersttnd. A lady of New Orleans."&#xD;
- " O  New Orleans?" echoed the relatives.&#xD;
"Of wealt" and family," continued the Doctor.&#xD;
"Oh ! aim !i! if she is wealthy, Josiah has done well," they again&#xD;
echoed, "A planter's daughteer-a lady of New Orleans, oh !I"&#xD;
"Well," groaned the old miser, "Joe'has reformed ; chil--children ;&#xD;
I-I only seek to do justice; I-I have lived long, and, I hope, al-&#xD;

again placed upon his pillow, while the attorney made this codicil to&#xD;
the will, signed and witnessed by the Doctor and the "spiritual&#xD;

&#xD;
showed the c-n-rent of their griefs ran quite away from all sorrow for&#xD;
the dying parent, inasmuch as a general buzzing, an 1 finally almost a&#xD;
row, took place among the heirs, in reference to the settling of the old&#xD;
miser's affairs, ere yet the breath of life was out of his boly. The old&#xD;
man, hearing this squabble, which the Doctor a (d prelate in vain&#xD;
essayed to suppress-by dint of great effort, scramb cad up in the bed--.&#xD;
a ghastly figure of bone and skin-his eyes glassy   d sunken-his&#xD;
thin lips livid, and the most poignant mortification and care stamped&#xD;
upon his features.&#xD;
" In God's name, in--in his holy name, ehil--cildren, wait until&#xD;
your--four poor old-old father is cold-cold--'cold, before you-you&#xD;
fight over his body-boly. Doc-Doctor, sen 1 for-for my poor boy,&#xD;
Joe; send for him. lie-lie would not serve me so."&#xD;
"I'll send for him," responded the Doctor. But upon a second&#xD;
thought, it ,occurred to him that he was totally ignorant of young&#xD;
Prog's whereabouts. however, he dispatched a note to J. Flapps,&#xD;
Esq., News of the Age office, and that individual was present in a&#xD;
brief period afterwards.&#xD;
Flapps entered the chamber just in season to witness a scene more&#xD;
often occurring than described-a battle of the living for the fit of the&#xD;
dying. Though accustomed, as he was, to exhibitions of every shade&#xD;
of crime, folly, misery, and terror, this, to loin, almost appeared new,&#xD;
horrible, shameful ; he was quite shocked; and would have withdrew&#xD;
himself; but just at that moment old Frog caught sight of him, and sup-&#xD;
posing him to be his son, called him to the bed-side-made an effort to&#xD;
speak, but, discovering his error, again averted his gaze and asked for&#xD;
"Joe."  Dr. Swabs thought Flapps might surely know young Frog's&#xD;
place of residence; but that individual informed the physician of MNr. ,&#xD;
Joe Prog's departure for parts unknown. Flapps, having business on&#xD;
the pier, as the'line to the South was shoving out that morning, got .a&#xD;
glimpse of Prog, making his hasty exit; and, from the manner of his&#xD;
shying and dodging, the reporter guessed Joe was up to some more&#xD;
of his tricks. The reporter, in a side-whisper, while the spiritual ad&#xD;
viser was imparting his last consolation to the now rapidly sinking&#xD;
miser-informed Dr. Swabs that Mr. Conrad Vinton, his student,&#xD;
was at that time lying dangerously ill, from blo*s and stabs received&#xD;
in a house of ill-fame, the night previous.&#xD;
"My God !" ejaculated the Doctor, "I was afraid something had&#xD;
occurred. Where is he now, Mr. Flapps, have you seen him this&#xD;
morning?"                                              '&#xD;
"Yes, sir, and but for me he would have been a 'corpse. IIe was&#xD;
set upon by two i'ffians, with whom he had some previous 'difficulty&#xD;
in the street, in reference to that ballet dancer."&#xD;
"Yes, yes, I remember the circumstance. My God ! I told him to&#xD;
be careful."&#xD;
&#xD;
1 !&#xD;
&#xD;
" Well, I happened to be present, got the police and rescued Vinton,&#xD;
or they certainly would have murdered him. I then had him taken&#xD;
to a friend's house, where he now lies; I saw him this morning, and&#xD;
he requested me to see you as quick as I could do so."&#xD;
"1 will, I will, as soon as the old fellow here gets over his trouble."&#xD;
And Flapps beat a retreat just as the last convulsive throes of hath&#xD;
severed old Prog's life thread, and his soul took its flight- where, is&#xD;
a matter too doubtful for us to imagine; but his book of life, its cares,&#xD;
misery, and miserly wretchedness, was closed, and the grand scrabble&#xD;
took place for his meanly gotten wealth. Dr. Swabs had lost a valu-&#xD;
able patron, and he left the chamber to proceed to another scene of&#xD;
liet, cogitating, as tie rode along, the amount of his bills against the&#xD;
Prog estate, his own peculiar afihirs of the previous evening, and the&#xD;
curious and never-ending rotary evolutions of life and its changes&#xD;
generally.&#xD;
Conrad Vinton, as Flapps had stated, was badly wounded, being&#xD;
cut, with a dirk, in several places, and his face so bruised and swollen&#xD;
as to be scarcely recognizable. But, finding him comfortably quar-&#xD;
tered with a widow lady-a friend of the indefatigable .reporter-&#xD;
the Doctor advised Conrad to remain there ; he would attend to him,&#xD;
and give. it out at home that Mr. Vinton had been suddenly called&#xD;
away to see his friends, etc. Conrad inquired if the Doctor had seen&#xD;
or heard anything of Mr. Prog, Jr., but the Doctor said he had not.&#xD;
"Mr. Flapps tells me Mr. Prog has gone South-saw him leaving&#xD;
town this morning, in a manner that aroused in his mind suspicion&#xD;
that young Prog was anxious to leave unseen by his friends or ac-&#xD;
quaintances, and perhaps for some very especial reasons."&#xD;
"lie 's an unmitigated rascal, sir," said the student.&#xD;
"I have no doubt but that his character is bad and growing worse,"&#xD;
replied the Doctor, "but lie is indebted to me for a rare fall of good&#xD;
fortune this morning; a few good words of mine gained him $30,000."&#xD;
"Is it possible? Iow did that occur, sir?"&#xD;
"lis father died about two hours ago; he had intended to cut&#xD;
Josiah Frog, Jr., off without a dollar, but I assured the old miserly&#xD;
creature that his son was doing bettei--improving-had married well,&#xD;
and vould reform. Josey was always the old man's pet, although&#xD;
latterly, the scamp had treated his father in the most shameful man-&#xD;
ner; but I felt the necessity of saving something for the wild, dissi-&#xD;
pated man; he 'll need it before long, I am sure ; and after witnessing&#xD;
what I did among his brothers and sisters, at the o'd man's 'death&#xD;
hour, hang me if I think Josey much worse in moral -principle than&#xD;
any of them! "&#xD;
" Go: help us, sir," said the very serious student, "I think the state.&#xD;
of morals here generally is bad, bad, bad."&#xD;
"They are ; none of us can well boast of the healthy state of our&#xD;
moral structures. Society is infectious ; it, is not, we find, leaving&#xD;

things undone, but keeping them unknown, that preserves thousands&#xD;
around us from annihilation."&#xD;
"I begin to think so, sir," said Conrad, "and it will more than&#xD;
ever, I trust, strengthen my intention of avoiding an unnecessary&#xD;
acquaintance with it. Last night. sir, has been a life-time to me.&#xD;
We fancy an entire familiarity with things around us, by looking at&#xD;
the surface; last night convinced me, sir, of my gross ignorance of the&#xD;
real state of society at large, and my perfect ignorance of the great&#xD;
real undercurrent of' life, in this vast and really abominable city."&#xD;
"True, social matters are not in a very pleasing or desirable form ;&#xD;
society ,wants much purging, but we are all alive in the hope of a&#xD;
healthier state of things," reiterated the Doctor, rising and adjusting&#xD;
his neckeloth and putting on his gloves to depart.&#xD;
"Keep quiet and quite still; you will be able to lbe out and take a&#xD;
short journey in the country, and soon be recovered again"&#xD;
"I hope so ; please send me, (not by your servant, however,) my&#xD;
port folio and writing-case, and 1'11 manage to kill time, for a few&#xD;
days, if that infernal villain's knife does not finally kill me."&#xD;
- "Did you really recognize the villain who assaulted you ?"&#xD;
"Oh, yes, sir, quite distinctly; and he knew me. Ile was the same&#xD;
fellow I gave such a lesson in 'fencing,' while returning with the little&#xD;
French ballet dancer, one night, you recollect."&#xD;
"Yes, Mr. Flapps was telling me of the matter, or that connexion&#xD;
of it. By the way, I understand the little French artiste has quite&#xD;
enchanted several of you young gentlemen." Conrad smiled.&#xD;
"But," continued the Doctor, "I fear, Josey hrog, now that he has&#xD;
in reality gotten such a lift, will be a dangerous competitor for you, as&#xD;
scarcely credit his assertion of marriage with a wealthy lady of New&#xD;
Orleans.,                                          ,.&#xD;
"Lie is doubtless capable of any amount of rascality,t replied the&#xD;
student; but I hope the fate of that beautiful as innocent creature,&#xD;
Marie Lessaire, may never be so hopeless as to listen to or fall into&#xD;
any of the heartless snares of that miscreant. And I promise him,&#xD;
should he and I ever meet, there will be a serious matter settled&#xD;
between us," said the student.&#xD;
"A bad man, but I hope he may improve. Be quiet, Conrad, and&#xD;
you'II get along nicely enough. Good day."  And Dr. Swabs lel&#xD;
the unlucky student to his hurts and bitter reflection.&#xD;

CHAPTER       XVII.&#xD;
TOMB PRACTICE-THE FEMALE FORGER AND THE VAMPIRE--A CuNNING WOMAN MORT&#xD;
THAN A MATCH FOR A PETTIF(IGER-PUTTING THE LAWYER ON THE WRONG SCENT--&#xD;
THE COUNTERFEITER VISITS HIS ACCOMf LICE-A DANGEROUS ERRAND.&#xD;
"You had better tell me all, the whole truth of the matter, or I can&#xD;
do nothing for jou."     r&#xD;
"I have told the truth," said the woman, doggedly.&#xD;
"You say you drew the checks, signed them, and then presented&#xD;
and drew the money yourself?"&#xD;
"Yes, I have so," she replied.&#xD;
"But come, come, my good woman, that won't do. You never&#xD;
drew up tlese checks-there is a man in this business with you. If&#xD;
you wish me to defend you, let me have hold of all the facts, that I&#xD;
may the more readily and effectually cover then with doubts and fogs&#xD;
of legal reasonings and defences."&#xD;
"I have not yet asked you to defend me," indignantly responded&#xD;
the woman.&#xD;
"But you will require defence, madam-able counsel, or you '11&#xD;
surely go to the penitentiary for a life-time," said the pettifogger, a&#xD;
sort of vampire,.one of the many'who haunt'the poor wretchesever&#xD;
morning in the cells of the Tombs, and through working uon the&#xD;
fears of the innocent, or inciting the hopes of the guilty, ilch or ex-&#xD;
tract from the wretches, here incarcerated, the last cent-.-watches, fin.&#xD;
ger rings, pencils, hat, coat, or shirts, and then abandon or hang on to&#xD;
them as hope of further reward may dictate to their infamous hearts&#xD;
and calling.&#xD;
This vampire was catechising the woman arrested the night pre-&#xD;
vious, through Joe Prog and Flapps, the reporter, the circumstances&#xD;
of which the reader already comprehends. She was the same person&#xD;
with wiom Joe Prog made his fight, on a subsequent occasion, to&#xD;
Charleston; an artful, dangerous and talented woman, emanating from&#xD;
one of the best families of New Jersey, but now given up to infamy&#xD;
and crime. The circumstances fastening upon her, and a male accom-&#xD;
phce, the present charges, were of the most positive character, as far&#xD;
as the presenting of the'checks, receiving the money, etc., were con&#xD;
.cerned. The man and money, the most desirable parties for the min-&#xD;
ions of the law to fasten on, were yet at large, and through the&#xD;
pettifogger's exercises Upon the woman, certain 'fee and award' seek-&#xD;
ers hoped to come at the money and the man. Sihe proved more than&#xD;
a match for the vampire.&#xD;

"You '11 find it for your benefit to engage counsel at once," said the*&#xD;
vampire, "and if you give the case in my hands, I'll certainly do you&#xD;
justice.'"&#xD;
"I suppose I shall need counsel," said the woman, "but I have no&#xD;
means to pay the fees."&#xD;
"No money? why what has become of the money you drew from&#xD;
the banks?"&#xD;
"I never drew any," answered the woman, resolutely.&#xD;
" Psha! nonsense; come, come, you need n't attempt to pull wool&#xD;
over my.eyes ; you see I'in used to that. Come right, out with the&#xD;
truth, and money or no money, I'll defend you. Where is your con-&#xD;
fidant, your man?  Has lie got the money? Won't he come forward&#xD;
and pay for your defence ? "&#xD;
The woman viewed the lawyer a moment ; her dark keen eyes told&#xD;
that her mind was busy ; at length she spoke.&#xD;
"I hope I can confide in you-you will not deceive me ? "&#xD;
" Confide ? of course you may. You may trust to my implicit con-&#xD;
fidence."&#xD;
"Then I'll tell you all." A devilish smile might have been seen&#xD;
playing about the corners of the woman's still beautiful eyes.&#xD;
"Then I'll tell you all, sir; the forger is Josiah Prog, Jr !"&#xD;
"What ! old Prog's son Joe ?"&#xD;
" lie is the man; his accomplice is a man named Flapps, the edlitor&#xD;
of a paper."&#xD;
"impossible. Why, he, Mr. Flapps, caused your arrest!"&#xD;
"He did?  Villainous scoundrel ! he did the treacherous part after&#xD;
his master, Joe Prog,,the cowardly ruffan, struck me down, to pre-&#xD;
vent me giving then up to justice. I'll have my revenge; curses&#xD;
light on them."&#xD;
"Woman, is this true ? "&#xD;
" You'll find it so. They seduced me to ,their rascally schemes,&#xD;
pocketed the amount of their forgeries, and thdn refused me a dollar&#xD;
of the money."&#xD;
"I'll want your testimony. I'll go and order the instant arrest of&#xD;
these men. I'll see that you are attended to and borne harmless,&#xD;
madam."&#xD;
"Do, if you please, it won't set you back any, my duckey," was&#xD;
the wretched woman's ribald response, as the pettifogger left the&#xD;
cell, to fasten his claws upon the victims of the subtle one's false-&#xD;
hood.&#xD;
"Yes, go, catch them both, d-n them; they ought both to swing&#xD;
as high as the moon. I'll be revenged on that cursed coward ; he '1&#xD;
never strike many more women, I'll'bet, if .I ever get free again. i&#xD;
hope my dear Ned has made his clear escape, -though I am afraid he&#xD;
has left no money or friends for me to work with." At this juncture&#xD;
of her soliloquy, the female counterfeiter saw a couple of demure,&#xD;

&#xD;
clerical looking gentlemen coming along the opposite corridor with&#xD;
one of the turnkeys of the prison.&#xD;
"«My God! he's here !" burst from her lips. Prsently the visitora&#xD;
passed the fallen woman's door.&#xD;
That woman's a panel thief and counterfeiter, gentlemen," said&#xD;
the turnkey, passing on with the nonchalance of a wild beast-exhibiter.&#xD;
"Ah !indeedI" said one of the gentlemen, loitering in the rear---&#xD;
a low ha-z-z-$h was muttered as he stuck a small packet through the&#xD;
grated door to the woman, and then hurried on.&#xD;

FRIEND IE WODH LD RATHER HAVE NOT SEEN-A HARROWING DIALOGUE-TE SOeIE&#xD;
SOCIETY-PLOT AND COUNTRIL--THE DRAFT AND DECEITFUL FRIEND-JOE PRoG&#xD;
BEAT IN A FRIENDLY WAY.&#xD;
Marie and her protector (!)-the old woman Harpy--arrived in&#xD;
Baltimore at the close of the day upon which they left New York,&#xD;
and instead of stopping at a hotel, as they purposed, Mrs. Harpy&#xD;
suddenly remembered a friend, an old widow lady, as she said, who&#xD;
lived in a retired part of the city, and who would be pleased, she&#xD;
knew, (!) to give them a hospitable welcome.&#xD;
"She has several very fine young ladies living with her, nieces, and&#xD;
one daughter, and we 'll be sure to be pleased with them, my dear."&#xD;
"Just as you think proper, madam," said the unsuspecting girl;&#xD;
"I would prefer stopping at a private house," she continued, "for I.&#xD;
have been so little from home that I know I should feel.lost and quite,&#xD;
awkward at a hotel among so many strangers."&#xD;
So the old hag called a carriage at the depot, and in a whisper gave&#xD;
the directions for conveying herself and victim to the "old widow&#xD;
lady's," in a retired part of the city.&#xD;
Joe Prog, under his assumed name, had already reached the city,&#xD;
but too late to present his draft, and being somewhat fatigued with his&#xD;
ups and downs, travel and excitements of the past twenty-four hours,&#xD;
went to his room, in one of the "best hotels," and turned in. He&#xD;
had given the hag all her instructions;. she was to remain in Balti-&#xD;
more, upon some pretext or other, as long as suited Prog's taste or&#xD;
convenience. So far as the anticipated and planned ruin of the poor&#xD;
ballet girl was concerned, Prog felt qute at ease; a great deal, of un-&#xD;
easiness was at work in his base mind in regard to the draft. To be&#xD;

foiled in that might not only lead to pecuniary embarrassment, it&#xD;
course of a short'time, but even personal danger seemed mixed up&#xD;
with it. Whilk thus cogitating the matter, a knock was heard upon&#xD;
the door.&#xD;
" Who's there ? "&#xD;
"A gentleman. sir, below wishes to see you, sir," said the servant.&#xD;
"Did he send his card ?"&#xD;
"No, sir.'&#xD;
"Or his name or business ?"&#xD;
"No, sir, neither; he says he must see you to-niglt."&#xD;
"Tell him the gentleman has retired ; stop, tell him to come up."&#xD;
While the servant proceeded with Prog's message, he got up and&#xD;
hastily threw on his morning gown, cap, and slippers, and took an&#xD;
easy attitude-though in great doubt and some alarm as to the person&#xD;
and purpose of his visitor at such an hour, but he was soon relieved&#xD;
by the return of the servant and "the gentleman."  .&#xD;
Frog started-his lips trembled, and a tremor of alarm danced in&#xD;
his keen gray eyes as they met the figure at the door. Both paused&#xD;
ifor a moiient; the stranger-a fine. dressed and finer looking man,&#xD;
of twenty-eight or thirty, with his hat in his hand, seemed awaiting&#xD;
Proo's attempt to break the silence.&#xD;
"Valk in, sir-you may go," said Frog to the servant as lie closed&#xD;
the door behind the stranger now in the room.&#xD;
"Joe, my boy, how are you?  Give me your hand; I'm devilish&#xD;
glad to see you, old fellow ; where did you spring from ? "&#xD;
"Fred, we parted enemies," said the roue calmly, for he forcibly&#xD;
felt the ill luck of meeting his old associate, Crome, the artist.&#xD;
"I know it, but I'm not the man to harbor malice or brood over&#xD;
revenge."-&#xD;
"'You insulted me grossly when last we met, without the slightest&#xD;
provocation."&#xD;
"Well, d-n it,let that all go to the d-l, forget our folly, and be&#xD;
as good friends as ever. There, there's my hand ; I did you wrong&#xD;
by accusing you of putting the hounds on my track ; I know it now,&#xD;
but let us bury the hatchet at once, for I didn't come and arouse you&#xD;
here at midnight for nothing ; I have come to shake- hands, have a&#xD;
bottle of wine, and a long talk over old affairs."&#xD;
"Not to-night; I am very tired, worried, used up, and must turn&#xD;
in. Come to-morrow evening, by that time 1'11 be-"&#xD;
'"Off and gone?" echoed Fred.&#xD;
"Sir!" said Prog, rising from his chair and assuming an air of in-&#xD;
dignant surprise that his secret purpose was so easily seen through.&#xD;
"Oh, come, old fellow, keep. your seat; don't be astonished or&#xD;
alarmed that I keep the run of you ;'as an old friend, Joe, I feel an&#xD;
interest in your movements; as a friend, I come to give a little useful&#xD;
information."&#xD;

prietor of a bank, two fine dogs, a trotting nag of 2.40 capacity, and&#xD;

" Well, sir, I must inform you," said Prog, trying to insist on b&#xD;
stiff show, " that I have given up my nonsense, married and-"&#xD;
" Ha ! ha ! ha ! ho!I ho!I you, Joe Prog I ho ! ho!I preaching! ho?&#xD;

Yes, two bottles of your sherry, said Crome,, or Gus Danvers, as his&#xD;
new title ran, to the servant appearing in answer to tlhe bell.&#xD;
The wine came, was decanted and they drank.&#xD;

"Well, no ,matter, you've been devilish lucky, that's all. Bnt&#xD;
what I was about to say is, what a beautiful fix we were in&#xD;
Whe--e-n-n last we parted,'&#xD;
as the song says. But you ,Slid, sQ did I. I found a friend ; she&#xD;

" Poh ! Joey, my old fellow, I've kept the run of you ; that old&#xD;
French lady was a rare prize. Oh ! don't grin, I know all about it."&#xD;
" All about what, sir ?" echoed Prog, with nmch concern.&#xD;
"She thought you an angel-a God-send ! Ha ! ha! she had the&#xD;
rocks; you made them fly; I used to hear of you, but I hope Joe&#xD;
Prog is a man of too fine talents to leave York in such a hurry, ,s he&#xD;
bas, with a little sylph of a ballet girl (Joe started) under one arm,&#xD;
without a safer anl more rare article in his wallet."&#xD;
" How in h---ll have you come at these ideas'?"&#xD;
"Facts, if you please. Well, we have a way, we have, of finding&#xD;
and keeping up the run of men in our line. I saw a certain old 'un&#xD;
at the depot, with a certain and very pretty little piece of French wax-&#xD;
work ; I knew you were about, found out where the old 'un put up,&#xD;
saw her, she told me you were to be about to-night ; I traced you here,&#xD;
and you see, how perfect is our system of espionage !"&#xD;
They again drank, and Prog remaining silent, 'Gus' continued:&#xD;
" Now, Joe, I want to advise and warn you. In the first place, join&#xD;
ur 'society,' all real gentlemen; we play for the amusement of the&#xD;
people, and our pastime. The association is large; extends all over&#xD;
the Union; none but men of talent, courage, and respectability are&#xD;
"lowed to enter. The brotherhood is perfect and carried on with per-&#xD;
fect fidelity ; none allowed to do dangerous things unless in extreme&#xD;
cases of necessity, and if one gets into a tight place, the association&#xD;
ttoks after him. Now, Joe, you will find this more safe and more&#xD;
pleasant than 'going it alone,' my boy."&#xD;
" how long have you been a member of this party, Fred, beg your&#xD;
pardon, Gus ? "&#xD;
"Well, about six months, and I tell you I've learned something, I&#xD;
have. We know the police; of course, keep the run of them; we&#xD;
always get scent of affairs before they do; and our plan is to give the&#xD;
-olice the run of all fellows drifting round on their own hook, doing&#xD;
sobs around our neighborhood, and then sliding off, by which we fire-&#xD;
quently get in a snarl. These favors make us capital, f course, with&#xD;
the police don 't you see?"&#xD;
"Yes, I understand," Prog .responded, with inwyd thanks for&#xD;
such valuable information.&#xD;
"Well, now, Josey, you see you are on a flying tour, levying on&#xD;
something in our province here, perhaps, and hence, but for me, you&#xD;
would be cornered."&#xD;
P'rog took the force of the remark much deeper than even his&#xD;
- su4btle friend thought of.&#xD;
"And now, sir," continued the artist, "let me advise you to join&#xD;
me; iet me know what you are really at, or clear out as quick as God&#xD;
will let you.&#xD;
Prog saw the folly of further dissimulation, but determined to keep&#xD;
t little in the background ; not to say too much, bor he knew full well&#xD;

&#xD;
that a gambler and a criminal was the last person to standctipon&#xD;
.worsl, regard feelings or suspicion, or the possessor of a grain of&#xD;
honor.&#xD;
Well, Gus Danvers, I'll join your association, upon your asser-&#xD;
tions of its steadfast honor and fidelity of brotherhood ; I ought not&#xD;
to doubt you; we are and have been friends; but, before I join you,&#xD;
to prove, beyond the shadow of a doubt, that every man is a gentle-&#xD;
man, a man of honor, I'I1 throw out a small 'flyer' to test one of&#xD;
them. Throw off your clothes, stop with me until morning, we '11&#xD;
take a private breaktst, and I'll trust you with a little banking busi-&#xD;
ness; no fraud-, clear and clean transaction ; there is one draft, yob;&#xD;
see, for $5,000, on~New Orleans; there 's another; there's a certifi-&#xD;
cate of deposit for $15,000, in New York ; another of $6,00, in&#xD;
Philadelphia, and here 's a draft on Balthuore for $9,000; I'll trust&#xD;
you to draw that, Fred-Gus, rather-give you a lift, and after a brief&#xD;
fly around here with my little pet of the ballet, I'll join your crowd,&#xD;
gather up my old French lady's deposits in New York, and cut her&#xD;
acquaintance."&#xD;
"Agreed ! Oh, there 's no back out in me. You say the thing 'a&#xD;
safe "&#xD;
"Perfectly safe. My wife'8 draft," said Prog.&#xD;
Next morning, the draft was presented by the painter, and it was&#xD;
cashed, not without some hesitation, however, but it was done, and&#xD;
the painter, according to agreement, met Prog at a certain cabaret.&#xD;
But what was Prog's astonishment, whi  he - asked for the funds, to&#xD;
see Crome count off ha/f and push it to y rd hm, while he coolly&#xD;
pocketed the other, saying: -&#xD;
"Now we are square, and the sooner yoi leave this town the better&#xD;
for you. I know you, Joe Prog; a baser scoundrel does not exist;&#xD;
that draft I'm certain is a forgery; I swore through thick and thin to&#xD;
met it cashed, and you may bless my honesty that I gave you t full&#xD;
laW. Now I 'in off; I shall not stop this side of Europe, and some&#xD;
day may return a wiser and a butter man. Au reoir, Joey, cut your&#xD;
stick, and I won't blab, but don 't you hang on long; au re7,oir--ha,&#xD;
ha! " and the painter disappeared, leaving Prog mute and dumb-&#xD;
founded with astonishment. Tie found a greater amount of diplioity&#xD;
and cunning in the artist than he had made ample allowance bor. But&#xD;
no tune was to be lost; he knew that Madam     would soon miss&#xD;
her draft, and, forward word to her bankers to look out for forgeries.&#xD;
lie thought it politic to get the old woman Ilarpy ofl his track, and&#xD;
carry off the ballet girl under his own protection ; and with thesa.&#xD;
plans and purposes to put in force, we leave lum for the present.&#xD;

TORY--TIlE BELE OF TIlE BAILIT WITHIN THE OUTER CiCLE OF TIlE MAlESTROM O&#xD;
SIN--A MUSICAL PARTY-lIE CoUrACT-Ta .LiECiiR AND THE ANGEL OF PURITY&#xD;
The private residence of the "elderly lady and daughters and nieces,"&#xD;
inr Baltimuore, to which Mrs. Ilarpy took Mai'ie, was in a very respect=&#xD;
able and retired part of the monumental city ; a den of e'iirie and&#xD;
licentiousness, under the very shale of the monument to the godlike&#xD;
Washington. Mrs. Iazzarl, the proprietress of the house. was a&#xD;
decayed widow of a once wealtl'y and respectable public officer of&#xD;
Washington City; he having got into bad habits, superinduced, as it&#xD;
was said, by the evil disposition and practices of his wife, was dis-&#xD;
charged from office, took to drilik, and died miserable.  After his&#xD;
death, his wife opened a very select establishnint, in the suburbs of&#xD;
the capital, for the accommodation of the M. C.'s and other dignitaries&#xD;
of government to pass their leisure evenings, sip wine, smoke cigars,&#xD;
lay cards, etc., quietly. 'Some of thIe friends of the flhmily, not liking&#xD;
the sort of' establishment she was su)p)sel to keep, threatened, coaxed,&#xD;
and finally induced her to leave for parts unknown, change her 'amine,&#xD;
an d(lo as she liked. She went to various places North and West,&#xD;
but being a southern born, no place suited her like Washington ; and&#xD;
she could not go there without a violation of her pledged word ; and,&#xD;
bad as she was, she still bel \l that binding; so sime settled in Balti-&#xD;
more.   Mrs. Ilazzard had seen so many such "comings " as that of&#xD;
Marie and her base inductor, Mr's. Ilarpy, that beyond the stipulations&#xD;
of furnishing them apartments, and being wvell paid for them, she took&#xD;
little or' no pains to discover or Oversee their private purposes, who&#xD;
or what they were.&#xD;
As Mrs. JIarpy. according to arrangements with her employer, was&#xD;
sick the next (lay after he arrival in Baltimore, with Marie, they were,&#xD;
of course, to remmlain until she re()vem'red. lThmrongh a veIny fomimal intro.&#xD;
duetion to the three "nieces" of Mrs. Ilazzard Marie was mext morning&#xD;
shown into the landsomie parl' of the house, where a splendid rosewood&#xD;
five lhundre(l dollar' specilmn of Chickering's pianos stood beneati a&#xD;
mirror of oriental elegance and vast cost. Indee(, the general spleior&#xD;
of the parllors gave Marie an -im npressive notion of' the respe('taitlity&#xD;
md wealth of Mrs. llarpv's widowed frienid1 amid partly dispelled the&#xD;
lioume-sick feelings of the breas\fast hour. The nieces, too, were rare&#xD;
an 1 fascinating young ldies, one abonmt the age- of Ma ie, and in point&#xD;
of personal b. auty but Ittle inferior to the ballet belle herself.  The&#xD;

other two were much older, but extremely handsome, ana so. winning&#xD;
in manners and disposition, that Marie was quite at home with them&#xD;
in a few hours, and the foundation of her ruin laid before she was&#xD;
conscious of the slightest proximity to infectious company, or the re-&#xD;
motest deviation from the paths of rectitude and virtue she had ever&#xD;
known. Old Mrs. Harpy had introduced the ballet girl as Alice Les-&#xD;
ter; and time reason she did so. she explained to Marie in this way :&#xD;
"My dear, when we g' m       lazzard's I '1l introduce you as one&#xD;
of my nieces, Alice Lest5a  au ng lady Mrs. Ilazzard has heard me&#xD;
speak of so often, but whom, ame has never seen, and has asked n&#xD;
fifty times to bring her along with me, some of these days ; so I'1l&#xD;
pass you off for my niece, he! he! it will be such a dev- such a&#xD;
good joke, lie! lie! " Marie slightly remonstrated, but gave way to&#xD;
the oil crone finally, upon her saying she would tell Mrs. Ilazzard it&#xD;
was all a joke, when they were ready to start on their journey again.&#xD;
" Do you play upon the piano, Alice ? "said one of the young ladies,&#xD;
thrown  up the case of the instrument and drawing up the stool.&#xD;
"Ohyes,I do," said Marie.&#xD;
Then, of course, all the ladies insisted on her sitting down and&#xD;
furnishing them with a favorite air, to which the little belleqmickly&#xD;
responlecl. She played elegantly, and accompanying herself by her&#xD;
well-modulated and delicate soprano voice, she quite astonished and&#xD;
delighted the ladiesXll of whom played well, as they Lad been inzg&#xD;
pressed with their own talents upon the instrument, but feeling now&#xD;
too timid to perform i presence of such an artiste, as they pronounced&#xD;
Alice, they insisted on her favoring them with several pieces of the&#xD;
fashionable music scattered over the piano. Even Mrs. ,Hazzard left&#xD;
her other occupations to hear the stranger play upon her handsome&#xD;
and elegantly toned instrument; she was as much enraptured as her,&#xD;
nieces with Alice's musical abilities, on which she began to speculate&#xD;
upon the immense advantages to be derived from the possession of&#xD;
such a gem, to ornament and enhance the attractions of her respectable&#xD;
seraglio. For this woman was all "fury; " scarce a drop of pure&#xD;
blood of woman remained in her heart or veins. She had no pity,&#xD;
and less remorse ; and at the mercy of two such wretches as Mrs.,&#xD;
llarpy and Mrs. Hazzard, and already the chosen and planned victim&#xD;
of -a damned libertine, the poor girl's case was desperate-could sihe,&#xD;
escape their combined snares ?&#xD;
"Egad, I'll keep her if I can," said Mrs. IIazzard, as she left the&#xD;
apartmment; "and as there is no telling how long she is to be here, I'll&#xD;
cast about me at once for means to get her away from old iarpy and&#xD;
her employer "&#xD;
That afternoon, the ballet girl passed several hours in the private&#xD;
room of Mrs. Ilazzard;. the subtle woman found no difficulty in corn&#xD;
ing to the true state of Marie's real situation, and the old wretch but&#xD;
laughed in her sleeve at the artless simplicity and ignorance of the&#xD;

poor girl, in not knowing or dreaming of the 'situation she was in, o&#xD;
the company she was among. Mrs. Hazzard's plan was soon formed&#xD;
She could buy off Mrs. Harpy, and easily frame an excuse to Marie.&#xD;
for getting her away; which was performed by informing Marie that&#xD;
her old lady friend was so very ill, that she would be obliged to go tc&#xD;
the hospital, and thus of course be prevented from accompanying her&#xD;
any further on her journey. This alarmed Marie; she expressed her&#xD;
fears of traveling aone ; and Mrs. Ilazzard complicated these draw-&#xD;
backs, by insisting that it was not only dangerous, but, in fact, foolish&#xD;
to go so far alone.&#xD;
" Antl," said she, "I can't advise you to go; the business you are&#xD;
engaged in is not s'reputable ; and what is worse, it is not profitable,&#xD;
Miss Lester, as to induce a young lady of your elegant appearance&#xD;
and great musical talents, to go so far, when you could do so much&#xD;
better here."&#xD;
"ere'?" said Marie, "what better can I do here ?"&#xD;
"Why, my dear child, you are competent to teach music ; you can&#xD;
have the use of my parlor and my piano, and I know a dozen (so she&#xD;
aid!) young ladies, who would, be 'glad to have such an opportunity&#xD;
of taking private lessons in my house, and would pay well."&#xD;
"Oh! if I could only make a living for myself and mother, madam,&#xD;
I would be wholly iecomnpensed and satisfied, and would bless you for&#xD;
your kindness as long as 1 lived !'. and in the enthusiasm of her a-rdent&#xD;
nature, the poor ballet girl threw herself into the arms of her fiendish&#xD;
adviser.&#xD;
That evening, Mrs. Ilarpy, receiving a bonus from Mrs. IUazzard,&#xD;
and retaining considerable money given to her by Frog, for Marie's&#xD;
nse, etc., took an evening train for Philadelphia, pleased with the fact&#xD;
that this was a transaction which had paid her handsomely.&#xD;
About the hour of her leaving, a note was despatched to a wealthy&#xD;
old libidinous monster of the city, to call at Mrs. Hazzard's, and the&#xD;
atrocious old creature came. lie soon learned the nature of the re-&#xD;
quest for his appearance, and be soon after saw the victim for which&#xD;
. be was to bid. Under pretence of being an uncle, having some nieces&#xD;
to teach music-a great taste tid veneration for musical genius and&#xD;
talent-he was introduced to Miss Lester--the old hag preferring to&#xD;
stick to HJarpy's soubriquet instead of Marie's real name; and through&#xD;
there spectable, gentlemanly and fatherly bearing of the debauchee, the&#xD;
poor girl was bereft of any suspicion, and evinced no reserve of man-&#xD;
ner apart from that of a simple child, in the presence of an undoubted&#xD;
friend or relative-yea, a parent, whose age and speech the old roue&#xD;
indeed personated. The old sinner. (and more's the pity, that every&#xD;
city and town, aye ! every country is replete with such accursed, de-&#xD;
praved monstrosities,) left the poor balletgiil with even worse and&#xD;
more damnable feelings in his heart than when he came. A private&#xD;
tete-a-tets w' h Mrs. Ilazzard, a doucer of no inconsiderable magnitude&#xD;
&#xD;
t&#xD;
&#xD;
placed in her hand, completed the opening of compacts between them;&#xD;
the sacrifice of a defenseless girl's honor was the stake which they&#xD;
ratified, and the old lecherous wretch left the p cincts, the den of&#xD;
vice, in as much glee as though he hal effected  union of holy ties&#xD;
between youth and hope, or raised a fellow fallen cr ature from crime&#xD;
and wretchedness, to an elevation of the brightest future. And thus&#xD;
he meandered and chuckled his way to his own opulent home, where&#xD;
his own offspring-many of them yet as youthful and innocent as the&#xD;
poor ballet girl-were joyed to hear his approaching footstep and clasp&#xD;
his paternal hand ! Great God ! this is a veritable picture of poor,&#xD;
fickle, and depraved human nature.&#xD;
Mrs. Ilazzard having left Marie and the old ron9 together, for the&#xD;
last fifteen minutes of their interview, returned to compliment her&#xD;
upon the impression she had made upon the "good old gentleman,"&#xD;
and insisted it was a lucky day that brought Marie to Baltiinore, where&#xD;
she would yet make her fortune and spend many happy days ; and at&#xD;
her instance;Marie was importuned to write to her mother the change&#xD;
of purpose and the bright hopes now offering.&#xD;

Joe Frog returned to the hotel, and immediately made his arrange-&#xD;
ments to leave for the South, but he felt himself too deeply humiliated&#xD;
by one Toss and disappointment to submit to another, even if his per-&#xD;
sonal safety was at stale. So, forwarding his baggage to a certain&#xD;
town in  irginia, he started for the established t of Mrs. Hazzard,&#xD;
about dusk, to see Mrs. Harpy and effect the abduction of Marie.&#xD;
On his way he chanced to meet a New York acquaintance, who in-&#xD;
sisted on hanging to Joe, and in spite of every exertion and excuse,&#xD;
Frog was forced to spend several hours with his friend, and finally&#xD;
take him to the point of his destination, at which they arrived about&#xD;
an hour after the departure of the old merchant and broker, whom we&#xD;
have deserved, feebly, in our last chapter.&#xD;
Frog was but imperfectly known to Mrs. lazzard, or it ip probable&#xD;
that he would have been refused, under the new order of things&#xD;

admittance to the house. Bnt Joe and his friend were in, and soon after&#xD;
Prog made known his position and desire to see 'the little French hal-&#xD;
let girl, which Mrs. Iazzard was anxious now to prevent. But, beimg&#xD;
full of distempering draughts and otherwise- desperate, Prog was not&#xD;
to be denied ; and, in the midst of their  olloquyin Mrs. Ilazzard's&#xD;
private sitting or business room, in care, certainly unexpected to both,&#xD;
the Belle of' the Ballet!                             .&#xD;
Marie was certainly surprised to see Prog there, of whose interference&#xD;
in her affairs she had no knowledge, fiurthrer than his offering and fur-&#xD;
nishing the funds for traveling expenses to reach her' patron, Madame&#xD;
Ellsler, aft I putting her under the care of his aunt, (!) Mrs. ilarpy.&#xD;
"Mr. Prog," s 1 Marie.&#xD;
"Yes, Miss Lessaire, I have just arrived in the city ; hearing of the&#xD;
illness of Mrs. IIarpy, I came immediately on, knowing that you would&#xD;
be at a loss how to proceed ; and here I am to offer you any assistance&#xD;
or favor for the prosecuting of your journey."&#xD;
"I thank you, sir, kindly, very kindly, but I have reason to believe&#xD;
that I shall do ell by remaining where I am," said Marie.&#xD;
here? "- &amp;amp;  Prog, in surprise, "impossible !&#xD;
"It is true, sir," responded Mrs. Iiazzard. " Sie has consented to&#xD;
remain here, until she hears from her mother, at least."&#xD;
Marie, do you know where you are ? " said Prog.&#xD;
"Yes, she does ! " answered Mrs. IIazzard, "but she don't know&#xD;
you, sir, as well as sire ought ! "&#xD;
"Look, you," said the somewhat discomfited libertine, in a tone of&#xD;
deep bitterness, " look, you, mrra(damr, we are not strangers ; I claim&#xD;
that girl as under my protection-"&#xD;
"Your protection'! " echoed Mrs. IIazzard, in a derisive tone.&#xD;
" Yes, my protection ; I can fathom your purpose for keeping her&#xD;
here, but I'11lisappoint you, you hag ! "&#xD;
Don't you use such terms in my house, sir, don't you, or by my&#xD;
life, I'll have you handled severely, you gambling scoundrel !"&#xD;
" Oh ! Mr. Prog, I tear I am deceived, ruined ! protect me ! " cried&#xD;
the alarmed girl, clinging to the villain.&#xD;
"I will, Marie. Don t be alarmed. I came here to snatch you from&#xD;
this inainrous place" and then in an under tone, as the terrified and&#xD;
halt' senseless girl clung to his breast, ie whispered to Mrs. Ilazzard-&#xD;
" do not utter another word against me, or by G---d 1 will annihilate&#xD;
you-demolish you and your house in three hours! You kpow me-&#xD;
kee your tongue inyour teeth and you '11 gain b'i it."&#xD;
Tihe old wretch knew, or had reason to believe, Prog a desperate&#xD;
profligate, and foreseeing that the entity of such a fellow might pro-&#xD;
duce a revolution in Irer' premises more dangerous and disastrous&#xD;
than all she could realize under the must prourrsing circumstances,&#xD;
by retaining- the girl, she sullenly closed the conversation, having&#xD;
Prog to fiih his work with Marie, promising a speedy return.&#xD;

why the reward will pay well. Now, I 'ii tell you what I'll do; I'h&#xD;
give you the men for one thousand dollars, you take the risks and give&#xD;
me a third, cash down, the balance in sixty days."&#xD;
" Oh, oh ; come, come, old fuller, that's drawing it too d-d strong,"&#xD;
said the policeman ; "you can't come that."&#xD;
"Do you object? 'Say quick, for I can do the job myself, but I&#xD;
promised to go in with you, a-nd by G-d I never break my engage-&#xD;
ments. Out with it-yes, or no ? " said the pettifogger.&#xD;
"Well, now look a'lere, Craft, you're crowding us ; we are always&#xD;
willing, you know, to do the fhir thing; we have given you bonuc$,&#xD;
and you know we 'ye lost by it," replied the policeman ; " butif you&#xD;
guarantee this a sure thing, if the woman hasn't lied, an1 we can nab&#xD;
the coves at once, we '11 go in for the arrangement, but we would&#xD;
rather you would go in with us, and share equal."&#xD;
"No ; you know it plays the d--l with an attorney to be found in&#xD;
this sort of business; I'll go the proposition, nothing else ; it will pay&#xD;
you well, and you can afford it."&#xD;
"Nutf ced, we '11 go it; give us a receipt for the money, and here it&#xD;
is. Now, who are the men I"&#xD;
" Joe Prog and Jerry Flapps."&#xD;
"What? Joe Frog-Jerry Flapps ? " said the policeman.&#xD;
".They are the men ; nab 'em at once. No mistake."&#xD;
"FPhe-e.e-ew !t" whistled the officers.-" Joe Frog 's off-saw him&#xD;
Gliding out, and said right off there was something in the wind ; and&#xD;
I saw Flapps puttering around suspiciously when Frog was getting&#xD;
off," said one of the policemen, with whom our readers are slightly&#xD;
acquainted-Grab.&#xD;
"But let 's be stirring," continued Grab, "we '11 snatch Flapps, and&#xD;
then see after Joe Prog"&#xD;
"I 'm sorry we have to take Flapps," said the.other, "for he '1i not&#xD;
stand a compromise, we '11 have to put him through legally, and he's&#xD;
a fast one and well up to the ropes ; but we '11 take him anyhow."&#xD;
And the trio dissolved their conference ; the pettifogger in pursuit&#xD;
of a dinner and a bottle, while Grab and'his fellow thief catcher set&#xD;
out for, and very speedily arrested, the much astonished Mr. Flapps,&#xD;
who was busy calculating the gains over a long article he had just&#xD;
written, detailing the arrest of the forger and peculiar circumstance of&#xD;
the ease. Flapps began to suspicion a gre  many things, among&#xD;
which was, that Joe Frog had got him into some snare to screen his&#xD;
own designs, hence his trying to avoid him also at the steamboat&#xD;
landing. It was useless to say anything to the officers who arrested&#xD;
him, and so Flapps accompanied them in moody silence, reserving his&#xD;
elocution for a -more important place and occasion ; and it was not&#xD;
peculiar at all that Grab and his fellow policentn construed this&#xD;
downcast manner in Flapps, as indubitable evidence of his guilt; and&#xD;
it was quite natural for them to wish him guilty ; such forgery cases&#xD;

are not so common as blackberries, an'I when gentlemen engaged in&#xD;
that line were brought up to the bull ring, they paid well. At the&#xD;
police office, the appearance of Flapps in a new part, and that so very&#xD;
serious, was quite exciting .to the loungers, loafers, officers, reporters,&#xD;
&amp;amp;c., to whom Flapps was so well known. Of course the reporter&#xD;
soon learned the secret of his arrest, and at which he laughed heartily,&#xD;
for he was no longer alarmed at the matter, and lost no time in making&#xD;
it very evident that the woman had put the officers on the wrong scent,&#xD;
to gratify two objects-the escape of her confederate, and to berevenged&#xD;
on um. Flapps, for causing her arrest, and Prog for striking her.&#xD;
The judge ordered the woman to be brought into court to be examined&#xD;
on this point, but lo1' and behold, the woman, had vanished I The&#xD;
dnall parcel she, received from the gentleman passing her cell, had&#xD;
arguments in it so solid and powerful, as to bribe, corrupt, and grease&#xD;
her wayyout of the stronghold of the massive prison. Great was the&#xD;
outcry and immense the wonder, as to how such a thing could 'be&#xD;
done, but the woman was non e5st inventue!  The law was 'done'&#xD;
as well as Flapps, the pettifogger, policeman, and the rest next inte-&#xD;
rested. The result was, Flapps got a speedy discharge from custody,&#xD;
and, now firmly convinced that he knew the real forger, denounced&#xD;
Prog at once as the man, and the policemen lost no time in starting&#xD;
off south.in hot pursuit of the libertine. In Philadelphia, while-scour-&#xD;
ing the well known haunts of crime and misery, the officers lit upon old&#xD;
Mrs. Iarpy, just returned foni Baltimore, and through her, Grab and&#xD;
h is associate got a clue of Joe Prog, and then started again fresh in&#xD;
his tracks.&#xD;
Of course Mrs. IIarpy kept dark in regard to her affair with the&#xD;
ballet girl. Mad. Lessaire, from Mr. Flapps, received the first inti-&#xD;
mation that ill was surely brewing towards her rest, and there was&#xD;
hardly ny doubt but that Prog had connived with the old woman he&#xD;
had represented as his aunt, in the abduction and ruin of Marie. This&#xD;
was a terrible blow for the poor widow, and in the midst of her&#xD;
trouble, a message came from the residence of Mad. 'Mignard, to  lesire&#xD;
her immediate attendance there, Mad. Mignard having, in a fit of hor-&#xD;
rors, taken a dose of strychnine, and was dying. The poor woman&#xD;
almost wild with the agonizing intelligence from Flap is, was staggered&#xD;
for a moment at the next blow, for she loved Mad. Mignard with the&#xD;
strong' feeling of a sister, and in a briet period she hurried on her bat&#xD;
and shawl, and started to see the unfortunate, abused, and fhted suicide.&#xD;
Mad. lM. yet breathed when Mad. Lessaire arrived ; she recognized her&#xD;
friend, but was unable to speak. Doctor Swabs was present; he hav-&#xD;
ing been sent for by the residents of the next chamber, who were first&#xD;
to overhear the cries of the dying woman, and discover her situation.&#xD;
" She is gone," said Dr. Swabs, as he held her beautiful jeweled&#xD;
hand in his own, and in deep. unftigned  sorrow, gazed upon the dead&#xD;
pale brow of the handsome and unfortunate woman. "She is gone;&#xD;

poor, poor creature. She was a good, kind-nearted, magnificent&#xD;
woman ; God be umerciful to her."  An I the physician, who had seer&#xD;
hundreds pass from tiuneto etermty without a thought of care orsor-&#xD;
rowfiulness of such a scene, shed tears.&#xD;
Mad. Lessaire threw herself upon the lifeless form of her friend, and&#xD;
wept bitterly ; and all present, the apartment being quite fill of the&#xD;
inmates of the house, all wept over the unfortunate woman's fate.&#xD;
A few hours after the demise of her friend, Mad. Lessaire, in a most&#xD;
unhappy frame of mind, arrived at her own domicil ; a young milliner,&#xD;
who was boarding with malam, to learn the flower-making business,&#xD;
informed her that two gentlemen had (ailed and inquired for Mad. Les&#xD;
saire, upon ver y particular matters, and they ha' started off, and come&#xD;
again, and not finding her at home, stated they would repeat the call&#xD;
carLy next morning. They had left noi name ; all the girl could tell in&#xD;
regard to their identity, was, that they appeared to be military men,&#xD;
having brass lttons and gold lace on their coats. Marie's dream&#xD;
flashed upon Mad. Lessaire's mind, and she fell half swooning into the&#xD;
arms of her attendant ; and overcome with the various transpirations&#xD;
of the past few hours, sue lay sonic minutes in a state of deathm-like&#xD;
somnolency.&#xD;
From this position she was aroused by t knocking at her front door.&#xD;
It being opened, two gentlemen again presented themselves, and being&#xD;
shown into time little parlor, the youngest of the gentlemen raising his&#xD;
cap, asked Mad. Lessaire if she hadI forgotten him! She gazed a&#xD;
moment, then clasping lis hand, exelaimed--.&#xD;
"iNo! it is George-George Pinekacy."&#xD;
"It is, 'Madame ; and I'ye had much difficulty to trace you in this&#xD;
vast city," young Pimkney replied. having introduced his friend,&#xD;
that gentleman made himself agreeable to the young milliner, while&#xD;
George listened to Mai. Lessaire's recital of sorrows and afflictions&#xD;
since parting with their few frien is in NewsOr'leans. Mad. Lessaire&#xD;
.muparted to the young muidshipiman her tears of Marie's destruction&#xD;
in the hands of' the scoundrel whose frw(n(lslujp she had blindly relied&#xD;
on in the sad hours of' piercing sorrow' and umisfortune. George listened&#xD;
to the statement with deep concern, and informed Mad. Lessaire that&#xD;
on the morning of the next (lay, himself and friend started for Wash-&#xD;
ington, and it would afford himn unbounded pleasure to overtake and&#xD;
discover Marie, if possible, and mete out to the base man, Prog, the&#xD;
personal chastisement he deserved, and with tis manly purpose in&#xD;
view, he hade'the poor widow good Might, and the next day, at an early&#xD;
hour, he was on his way south.&#xD;
Joe Prog was now at bay with a full pack hue and cry at his heels.&#xD;
The French widow, his late pseudo wife, had soon discovered her loss)&#xD;
and immediately forwarded word to her B3altimore bankers to be on&#xD;

donrad Vinton recovered; an epoch no sooner reached than his pr--&#xD;
viously formed notions ania intentions of reformation on the follies of the&#xD;
past, were forgotten in the dream of fiction, purely so, surrounding the&#xD;
dazzling pen of the splendid establishment to which he was introduced&#xD;
by Joe .rog. It was but a brief struggle between honor and tenpta-&#xD;
tion, and the latter proved an overwhelbiing force, in driving the student&#xD;
into the vortex of folly, extravagance, and finally crime ; for the once&#xD;
virtuous, highminded and talented student, descended, step by step,&#xD;
until now, a bloated, depraved outcast, minion of the brothel and&#xD;
gambling hell of the empire city, unler an assumed name-for with&#xD;
all his shameful depravity, he had at least that spark of' self or kindred&#xD;
respect, not to disgrace his family. Conrad passes his hours, doubt-&#xD;
less, in as much misery as shame. The temptress-she whom God&#xD;
formed in the most classic mold of purity and loveliness; she for&#xD;
Wkornnmen were damned, money and treasures squandered, the beau-&#xD;
tiful, profaned image of the once dear and beloved parents; she who&#xD;
entranced hearts at a single gaze, who led astray innumerable&#xD;
youths of hope and bright futures, like Conrad Vinton, died-died&#xD;
the horrid death of shame and loathsome misery: but a few years ago,&#xD;
in inmate of tie sick wards of Blackwell's Island, her name and her&#xD;
peerless beauty were memorandumis of a passing shadow, written in&#xD;
sand and water-gone, forgotten.&#xD;
Dr. Swabs grew repentant; he had more need of such an event than&#xD;
our little history could well spare space to record. lie felt sincerely&#xD;
for Conrad, but after the liscoveiy made by the studdnt, of his precep-&#xD;

was with the utmost reluctance and pity that the physician saw his&#xD;
student descend the ladder of shame and destruction. But he was fated,&#xD;
and to such an excess did a few months bring the young man, that&#xD;
Dr. Swabs' doors were closed upon him by the physician's lady, and&#xD;
one heart, true womanly; heart, at least, mourned and grieved for the-&#xD;
young man's loss-it .was the second daughter of the wealthy and&#xD;
respectable Dr. Swabs. And though she had never told her tale of&#xD;
inward love-though scarcely perceptible to the household eye, and&#xD;
perhaps as little dreamed of by the luckless student himself-the tinily&#xD;
circle, in a few short months after Conrad Vinton's abandonment to&#xD;
shame, enumerated one less, the Doctor stood over the corpse of his&#xD;
once fair daughter, and his own domicil was the scene of wo.&#xD;
If Flapps brought Mad. Lessaire bad news, it was not solely because&#xD;
he wished to deal largely in such unwelcome tidings, for upon time day of&#xD;
George Pinckney's departure for the south, that indefatigable purveyor&#xD;
of news and general information, rushed into the presence of the weep-&#xD;
ing widow with great satisfaction gleaming from his eyes, and a news-&#xD;
paper in his hand, to which he called the unceremonious attention of the&#xD;
poor widow. It was a New Orleans paper, containing, in French, an&#xD;
advertisement inquiring for a family named Lessaire, who had emi-&#xD;
grated from France, some years before, for New Orleans, and other-&#xD;
wise described the musician and his family, whose whereabouts, if&#xD;
alive, was desirable to have known to the advertiser, who had recently&#xD;
arrived in that city from France; signed, Gustave Lessaire.&#xD;
"Mon dieu! 'Mon dieu! My child!" screamed the now over&#xD;
joyed mother, falling senseless upon the floor, ere the happy 'reporter'&#xD;
could exert himself to prevent such a catastrophe.&#xD;
It was true, to be sure, 'o mountebank had interpreted the dream&#xD;
of the poor ballet girl, or foretold, for a paltry consideration, the event&#xD;
which was destined to unite the mother and her long-lost and never&#xD;
dreamed or mortally hoped for child; but it was true, nevertheless;&#xD;
there it was, in 'black and white,' and the 'reporter' exultingly flat-&#xD;
tered himself, that to him it was due, the happy honor of finding&#xD;
the advertisement, which otherwise never, probably, would have&#xD;
reached the widow Lessaire's car or eye, and has in a thousand such&#xD;
cases, the thread being broken; or its meanderings lost on earth, ilb in&#xD;
'another and a better world' they should be united, the mother and&#xD;
son, the brother and sister, could never more enjoy that embrace and&#xD;
union, (lear as the tie of sacred, holy beings ; dear as the heart's purple ey&#xD;
stream unto time heart, to stagnate which is to stop life, and annihilate&#xD;
all of its bright hopes and fairy-wove future.&#xD;
"Oh! how     - thank, a thousand times thank you, sir, for your&#xD;
kindness! Myj dear, dear boy, I shall see him again !" exclaimed&#xD;
the widow, as she recognized Flapps, and Miss Caruth, her boarder&#xD;
and pupil, who raised her from the floor and placed her upon the&#xD;
sofa.&#xD;

at the thought of the daigers besetting her thrice dear daughter.&#xD;

and try it on him. hurry along arter him."&#xD;
But Joe Prog wanted no homes then. his first determination was&#xD;
to fly and leave his victim, the poor ballet girl, behind, but his better&#xD;
feelings drove him to an opposite course. lie was acquainted in&#xD;
Washington; he knew the way to and arrangement of the various&#xD;
gambling and courtezan houses. To a well known den of aristocratic&#xD;
infamy he hurried his steps, was admitted, and made application for&#xD;
and succeeded in obtaining rooms for "himself and lady;" and made&#xD;
no secret of lis desperate situation in regard to the expected pursuit,&#xD;
alleging as the cause, however, that he had fleeced a gentleman out of&#xD;
several thou tmd dollars in Baltimore by gaming, and the vict m had&#xD;
sworn to recover it by process of law ; bhece, lie and his woman&#xD;
wanted concealment for a few days, an I for a round eonsidei'anon, or a&#xD;
promise of it, the old proprietress agreed to furnish the means at once.&#xD;
By a servant-tor bhe began to fear he might be arrested at any mo-&#xD;
nment-Prog sent a note to the hotel, where he had left Marie and her&#xD;
baggage, desiring her to accompany the servant to their new lodgings,&#xD;
where they were to remain for the balance of the day, and then to&#xD;
proceed on their journey. But time unfortunate profligate was doomed&#xD;
to another disappointment. The prolrietor' of the hotel chanced to&#xD;
see the servant, a negro gi, and knew her.&#xD;
What do you want here ? "&#xD;
"I cum wid a note to a lady in de h9tel, sali."&#xD;
"Let me see it," said the proprietor. "Alice Lester, elm? he con-&#xD;
tinued, reading the superscription. Then referrimg to his register, he&#xD;
discovered the name entered-Mrs. A. Lester. The note had not&#xD;
been sealed, but the servant had been cautioned not to deliver it to&#xD;
any one but the lady. The landlord read the note, and suspected&#xD;
something wrong. IIe called a servant, and ordered time lady to be&#xD;
requested to step down in the parlor, as a gentleman \vishgd to see her.&#xD;
My God ! is it possible ?" ejaculated the landlord, as the grace&#xD;
ful and beautiful girl glided into'his presence.&#xD;
" This the gentleman who wished to see me ? "&#xD;
Yes, miss ; it' I am not mistaken. I believe you afre connected with&#xD;
the stage-did you notdance with Mad. Elisler, at the Park Theater ?"&#xD;
I did, sir."&#xD;
May I be allowed to ask you why you are here?"&#xD;
I see no impropriety in the c question; sir. I am on my way to&#xD;
Cincinnati, where I expect to join Madame Ellsler, again."&#xD;
"But you are on the wrong route; are you not aware of it ?"&#xD;
I am not, sir," said Marie.&#xD;
"Then, my dear, it is my impression that you are in the hands&#xD;
of some evil advisers, who, for base purposes, are desirous of leading&#xD;
you astray."&#xD;

host closed the doors, and exhibited the note from Frog. Ie at once&#xD;
tol I the belle that the servant bringing the note was attached to a house&#xD;
of ill-fame in the city, to which the writer of'the note wished, as it ap-&#xD;
peared, to have her come.. Marie now saw the snare into which&#xD;
her heartless betrayer was endeavoring to draw her, and she hesitated&#xD;
not to believe that'the amiable,fatlherly-looking man before her, would&#xD;
be a protector and a friend, in'whom she could confide. Therefore,&#xD;
Marie gave the host a plain, unvarnished statement of matters per-&#xD;
tammug to her engagement, preparation, and so far performed journey.&#xD;
The host at once saw through the entire schemes of Prog. IIe desired&#xD;
Marie to remain in his house as long as she wished; lie would have&#xD;
the libertine attended to if lie ventured there again; and would ap-&#xD;
prise Madame Lessaire of the aspirations and present safety of her&#xD;
daughter; and went with the poor girl to his own private apartments,&#xD;
and introduced her to his thrice amiable lady and family, under-whose&#xD;
charge the rescued girl was placed.&#xD;
Frog no v found himself' literally done. lie raved and swore, but&#xD;
he knew, as far as his victim was concerned, that she was out of his&#xD;
reach. lie passed a night of horrors, drinking and chafing lie a&#xD;
fretted hyena. The next day lie slept; awaking about sunset, he&#xD;
began to reflect as to what course he should adopt for present and&#xD;
future movements. But the black pall of his depravity and blasted&#xD;
hopes made all dull, dark, dreadful to him. lie thought of suicide,&#xD;
then of flight ; he had no hope, but could not yet abandon life,  lie&#xD;
ordered up a bottle of wine, drank it, then dressed and started out,&#xD;
under cover of the night, to a famous or notorious gam bling hell, near&#xD;
the capital. here he met a fiiend1 and several acquaintances. Here&#xD;
he learned the plan of one of' his friends, a desperado, whoi he had&#xD;
formed an acquaintance with in New Orleans, to make a raise. Prog&#xD;
had sunk to such a state of infamy, and become so hardened-callous&#xD;
to consequences-that nothing appeared too desperate or dangerous,&#xD;
situated as he then was, to replenish his means and make his escape.&#xD;
That night a robbery was to be committed; a daring attempt at&#xD;
burglary. Joe Frog and two others were to do the deed, and Joe&#xD;
was inducted accordingly. On the outskirts of Washington, near the&#xD;
I'otomac, there stood an old fashioned mansion, occupied and owned&#xD;
by a resident of that district. lie was reported to be wealthy, and to&#xD;
have his money in his house. here it was, that that night, disguised&#xD;
and blacked, ar'med with implements of burglary and deadly weapons,&#xD;
Joe Frog and his atrocious companions were to commit violence, and&#xD;
replenish their famished purses. But the hours of time reckless rake&#xD;
and felon were numbered ; with a noiseless tick the moments of his&#xD;
ill-spent life were being doled out.&#xD;
Grab and his fellow-policeman arrived in Baltimore too late to find&#xD;
Prog. But, getting on his trail again, away they went to Washington&#xD;
where they fell in with another officer from the monumental city; an&#xD;

the trio went avant cautiously and surely to secure their prey. At the&#xD;
hotel, where, unfortunately for Prog, he had left Marie, the officers got&#xD;
their clue to his last stand. Anl to the temple of shame an: dishon r&#xD;
the police now bent their steps, which they reached a tv inute&#xD;
after Prog's departure for the gambling hell. The old womin  of&#xD;
the lhoun s'outly don'e I any such person b -ing there. But it was&#xD;
an oil story to Grab; he marshaled the way, anl the rest tbllowe.1.&#xD;

The officers knew that Irog was not tar oil, SO Grab's companion kept&#xD;
watch on the premises, while Grab an I the Baltimore iflieer beat&#xD;
around the city. But Irog hadl passed out of the city, with his nefa&#xD;
rious companions, to (1o their villanous work.&#xD;
All was hushed ; the night was favorable to their designs--dark&#xD;
and inclined to rain-as the three villains stealthily crept over the&#xD;
rear tince an I gained the top of a shed connected with the mansion.&#xD;
One of the trio, being a heavy, unwieldy Tian, remained on the ground,&#xD;
to guard against surprise, while Frog an I the other enteredl the sumai&#xD;
window from the shed. Prog's confied.erate was a double-dved villain ;&#xD;
lie hadIserved in the army, been in the pen'1itenitiary, anti 0lood was&#xD;
on his haus.  lrug was desperate, but not blin i to the consequences&#xD;
of his villainy, lie tt imelined to pause, even now, upon the very&#xD;
threshold of lhi first an I last act of erine ant desperation. But it&#xD;
was too late ; i 'ml a lvance.l so flr that there was no retreating, an I&#xD;
eo lie went on.  :aining the second floor by this easy'access,the'lit&#xD;
,lanterntourvey the position of things. They " tgd a large&#xD;
hall, iomti which opened three doors to a corresponding number of&#xD;
cliambets. In on. of these &amp;amp;iaiimbers the oil man slept and kept hris&#xD;
treasures.heoisl ssly the robbers approached the door, and glancing&#xD;
h     tughhe .ey-hide. by a taper dimly burning within, got 'a partial&#xD;
view of the interior of the apartment. To their satistetion they thund,&#xD;
after hiding their tight, the (loot' was not locked, ant they quite noise-&#xD;
lessy entered--approachedi the bed to secure the old man, that he&#xD;
might make no outcry-when, to their astonishment, they fund a&#xD;
huge negro servant coiled up an I snoring. A smile crossed the vil-&#xD;
lainous blackened thces of the robbers, but it soon passed for quite a&#xD;
ditfienret expression. As they turned froni the bed, Frog made a slight&#xD;
noise by stmiubling over an obstruction in his way-the negro awoke,&#xD;
saw the black men in his room, anI at once jumped from his bed,&#xD;
gave a yell, andt seized 'ne.. Joe Prog made a bound fr the floor ,&#xD;
his companion yelling kr nau to kill the negro. But Frog was for&#xD;
escaping, and in the (lark an]l contusion could not find his way out.&#xD;
The old main, whom they could have robbed and murdered, probably,&#xD;
tottered out of his room w ith a lamp and carbie ; and seeing Frog&#xD;
niaking at him, lie fired-the roue, forger. ant burglar, fell back over&#xD;

TILE FINALE OF LIFE SCENES.&#xD;
The evenng of the (lay upon which Marie hal foun 1frinds at the&#xD;
hotel, George Pinekney auil his companion arrived in Washington,&#xD;
and put up at the same place, but the young uilslhipman little dreamued&#xD;
that the angel of his thoughts was beneath the same roof with him.&#xD;
Ile hadI been mdter the impression that she anl her betrayer hartaken&#xD;
a western route, an were so far bevol reach that it would be a thllacy&#xD;
to attempt overtaking them. But a slight accident revealed the pres-&#xD;
ence of her he sought. Standing near the register, conversing vith a&#xD;
fi-en I, he overhead soe young gentlemen reading the names of the&#xD;
hbte arrivals announced in the hook, and says one:&#xD;
"Tn,m dil you-hear the story of this girl  " putting his finger on&#xD;
the nm ifct A. Lester-, ini the register.&#xD;
.No," answered the companion, " what sort of a story was it ?"&#xD;
" Well a scanmp came here from the North, yesterday, with a young&#xD;
irl, with whom tie hal ran of; as I understand it, an I attempted to&#xD;
ct tier inveigled into old Mrs. -'s brothel ; the landlord here got&#xD;
win 1 of it, upset the plans of the rascal, and is going to keep the girl&#xD;
nitt ie gets an opportunity to send her back to her friends. The&#xD;
scamp turns out to be a firger, and the police re on here after him."&#xD;
This was enmougt for young Pincknev. lie inneldiately saw.tjfr host,&#xD;
made huiself known, amd in eOui'Se of .a few nminutcs afterwai ls, he&#xD;
was in the presence of the little lieie, and so ovecoume was lie by the&#xD;
force of hiis ardent feelings, that he rushed to tier and clasped her in&#xD;
his arms !iTheirg meeting was cordial and afflicting, and concluded&#xD;
by George at once prot~rrig his services in seeing Marie satily back&#xD;
to ier mother, a imovetmient he encouraged as the most Cxpedienlt, at&#xD;
ounce. The hosbalso advised Marie to return, so it was concluded&#xD;
between them. that the poor girl should return to New York next day,&#xD;
aceeoiipluuiietl by tie young miilshiim~ian.'&#xD;

"I do. Marie, dietinctly."&#xD;
" Iromised to keep it as a dear token of a bashful friends But,&#xD;
G.ou'ay, I paritedl with it."&#xD;
1 know it l, dear Marie," said the midshipman, grasping her&#xD;
hmtnn,l '" I know it all. Truth is stranger than fiction. Is it not curi-&#xD;
ous however, that I should, by the merest accident in the world, stroll&#xD;
with a frien I into jewel shop, an I find the very same bracelet there&#xD;

You id?" exclaimed tle belle.&#xD;
"TIne, entirely so ; and it was not long ere I learned its history&#xD;
And tlere began my search for your parents. It was a l ng chases&#xD;
but I found you at length.&#xD;
"You have, then, seen my dear mother, siri "&#xD;
" I have, and regret to say she was almost frantic at t  news sh&#xD;
received of the dangers besetting you."&#xD;
911! nothing sblall telnpt me from her side again," exclaimed the&#xD;
poor girl ; "no toil, care, or privation can be too overtasking for my&#xD;
endurance by my mother's side."&#xD;
By daylight next morning, tile news of the attempted robbery of&#xD;
the old man's mansion spread over the city. The manacled prisoner&#xD;
and the dead body of Prog were brought to-the city, and thousands&#xD;
rushed to see them.&#xD;
"Au! poor devil," said drab, as ht looked upon the cold, lifeles,&#xD;
and handsome features of the rake, "I always expected lie 'd come tou&#xD;
a paSS of this kinmd fmally. IIe 's gone, and saves us trouble. Poor&#xD;
devil, had he known of the windfall lately left him by his old miserly&#xD;
fatlier, lie 'd kept his hand olt of this (lear job. But he 's gone," con-&#xD;
tinued the tiief-catel'er, and that ends our business."&#xD;
That day, George Pinckney and his charge, Grab, and his friends,&#xD;
returned to the great city, the metropolis of the Western world. The&#xD;
meeting between the other and daughter was moving to witness.&#xD;
When the poor girl learned the tidings of her long, long' lost brother,&#xD;
her joy knew no bounds; she danced, sung, and prattled like a romp-&#xD;
in' school gi1.r&#xD;
in the course of a few weeks. Gustave Lessaire, a fine military young&#xD;
ima, made his appearance to his mother and sister ' they wept, em-&#xD;
braced and laughed with joy. Tle young soldier's story was soon&#xD;
told.  lie had been wounded about the time his fatlher left France, and&#xD;
lay for a long period in the hospital. lie no sOod  recovered than&#xD;
he was again pressed into service; proved a fortunate soldier; he rode&#xD;
rapidly in the r/and armie, became colonel of a regiment served&#xD;
bravely and made money. When lie was about to seek his parents&#xD;
in the new world, he received intelligence of their deaths, by the furi-&#xD;
ous malady of New Orleans. Again lie sought the army, and again&#xD;
lie head of his father in America, and lie determined to seek his fraily&#xD;
in person ; the result of' this determination, our readers arme acquainted&#xD;

within a pleasant ride of the Crescent City, amid the orange groves&#xD;
and China trees of a beautiful mansion, on the sugar plantation of an&#xD;
ex-hieutenant, George Pinckney, the young and still beautiful Marie.&#xD;
the belle of the ballet cor s, presides as wite and mother of the young&#xD;
planter's family. Mad. Lessaire has passed away, living long enough&#xD;
to see ler children prosperous and happy. And thus, geutle indulgent&#xD;
